Assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) imply that A possesses (k − 1)k/2 free parameters, i.e., the
set of matrices satisfying (1.2)–(1.3) form an aﬃne subspace of dimension (k − 1)k/2.
For example, for k = 3, such a matrix can be written

A =

Actually, our problem can be seen as a straightforward generalization of Equation (1.4)
to the case of systems.

It is well known (see [CGS]) that (1.4) admits the (N +1)-parameter family of solutions

given by the standard bubbles

This is a case in which the powers of the non-linearity belong to the so-called critical
hyperbola introduced by Mitidieri in [M1] and [M2] (see also [CDM] and [PV]). It is
an interesting open problem to determine whether the system (1.6) admits nontrivial
solutions.

Among the other results, we will show that the trivial solution (U, U ) to (1.6) is non-
degenerate, up to translations and dilations (see Theorem 1.2 and the ensuing discussion
on page 6).

Another interesting system which has a lot of similarities with (1.1) is the well known

Toda system, namely

−∆ui =

cij euj

in R2,

k

Xj=1

(1.7)

for i = 1, . . . , k, where C = (cij)i,j=1,...,k is the Cartan matrix given by

Since we are considering a problem in the plane, the exponential nonlinearity is the
natural equivalent. There is a huge literature about the Toda system, we just recall

the classiﬁcation result of [JW] and the paper [GGW] where the matrix C = (cid:0) 2 µ
µ 2(cid:1)

was considered for µ ∈ (−2, 0). Observe that if we consider the Toda system with a
general symmetric, invertible, irreducible matrix C and assume that all the entries cij
are positive, then (see [CK, CSW, LZ1, LZ2]) all solutions are radial. In analogy with
this result, we believe that if all entries of A are positive then all solutions to (1.1)
are radial. We do not investigate this problem in this paper (even if we think that
this problem deserves to be studied in the future) and allow some coeﬃcients aij to be
negative. We will see that this causes the solution set to have a richer structure.

1.2. Main results and idea of the proof. A basic remark is that the system (1.1) does
not have a variational structure and so we cannot apply variational methods. Moreover
the critical powers induce a lack of compactness. Our basic tool will be the bifurcation

theory. Solutions to (1.1) are zeros of the functional F = (F1, . . . , Fk) :(cid:0)D1,2(RN )(cid:1)k

for i = 1, . . . , k. Of course we have that Fi(U, . . . , U ) = 0 and our aim is to ﬁnd solu-
tions close to (U, . . . , U ) for suitable values of (aij). We will use the classical Crandall-
Rabinowitz theorem [CR]. Its application requires three basic ingredients:

(i) a good functional setting for the operator F ,
(ii) a 1-dimensional kernel for the linearized operator F ′,
(iii) a transversality condition.

The lack of compactness and the rich structure of the kernel of the linearized operator
(see Proposition 1.2 below) make conditions (i) and (ii) not easy to check. (Condition
(iii) will be a straightforward computation involving the Jacobi polynomials). Now we
discuss the main points and the diﬃculties to be overcome in (i) and (ii).

Let us start with the functional setting.
First of all let us note that it is not immediate to derive that our solutions are positive.
Indeed, since some of the entries aij are not necessarily positive, we cannot apply the
maximum principle. And even if they were, F deﬁned in (1.8) is not smooth enough
because D1,2 → D1,2 : u 7→ u+ is not diﬀerentiable. This problem will be solved by

restricting our operator to the subspace of D1,2(cid:0)RN(cid:1) of functions decaying as |x|2−N at

inﬁnity. This choice, if from one side will allow to establish the positivity of the solution,
on the other hand creates problems to prove the compactness of the linearized operator.
This will be discussed in Section 2.2.

Now we discuss the point (ii), i.e., the linearization of F around the trivial solution

(U, . . . , U ). This leads to study the problem,

It is known that λ0 = N −2
N +2 and λ1 = 1 but nothing is known about the other eigenvalues.
Our ﬁrst result completely describes problem (1.10). We believe that this result has its
own independent interest.

Theorem 1.1. The eigenvalues of Problem (1.10) are the numbers

are the Jacobi polynomials.

This result extends Theorem 11.1 in [GG] where the linearized problem of the Liouville
equation in R2 at the standard bubble was considered and highlights the role of the
Jacobi polynomials as extension of the Legendre polynomials.

Theorem 1.1 will be used to describe all solutions to (1.9) thanks to a change of vari-
ables to diagonalize A. Since A is symmetric, it possesses k real eigenvalues Λ1, . . . , Λk,
counting algebraic multiplicity. Assumption (1.3) implies that 1 is always an eigenvalue
of A with (at least) the eigenvectors spanned by (1, . . . , 1). So, without loss of generality,
we can set Λ1 = 1. We have the following result,

Proposition 1.2. Equation (1.9) possesses a solution v = (v1, . . . , vk) 6= (0, . . . , 0) if
and only if

Λi = λn :=

(2n + N − 2)(2n + N )

N (N + 2)

(1.14)

for some i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and n ∈ N. The solutions coming from (1.14) are given by

v =

ch wn,h,

(1.15)

n

Xh=0

where ch ∈ Rk satisfy Ach = λnch and wn,h are deﬁned by (1.13). If several equalities
of the form (1.14) hold at the same time, the set of solutions to (1.9) is the linear span
of the associated solutions of the form (1.15).

In particular, one always has Λ1 = 1 = λ1 and the corresponding solutions are given by

v = c0(cid:16)x · ∇U +

(1.16)

for some c0, c1, . . . , cN ∈ Rk such that Aci = ci for all i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N }.

To apply Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem, let us consider a C1-path of matrices

I ⊆ R → Rk×k : α 7→ A(α)

such that, for all α ∈ I, A(α) satisﬁes (1.2)–(1.3). How to deal with more general
situations involving two or more parameters, can be found for example in the book [K].

6

GLADIALI, GROSSI, AND TROESTLER

Let Λ1(α) = 1, Λ2(α), . . . , Λk(α) be the eigenvalues of A(α). The previous result shows
that the linearized system (1.9) has two types of degeneracies. The ﬁrst one, which holds
for every value of α, is due to the invariance of the problem (1.1) under dilations and
translations, while the second one appears only at the special values α that satisfy (1.14).
N +2 (resp. Λi(α) = 1), then
) are solutions. These are the trivial

Note that, if n = 0 (resp. n = 1) in (1.14), i.e., if Λi(α) = N −2

∂xj

v = cU (resp. v = c0(cid:0)x · ∇U + N −2

values of α and they do not provide new solutions to problem (1.1).

Thus (1.14) with n > 2 is a necessary condition to guarantee bifurcating branches of
solutions. A similar phenomenon was previously observed in [GGW] for a general 2 × 2
Toda system in R2. Coming back to Problem (1.6), we have Λ1 = 1 and Λ2 = −1, so
(1.14) is never satisﬁed if n 6= 1. Hence the solution (U, U ) is non-degenerate (up to
dilation and translation).

Proposition 1.2 says that the kernel of the linearized operator is composed both by
radial and non-radial eigenfunctions. Of course this is a great obstruction to applying
Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem for which a one dimensional kernel is required. For this
reason we restrict the problem to the case of radial solutions in D1,2(RN ), i.e., we work
in the space D1,2
rad(RN ). However we think that the existence of non-radial eigenfunctions
implies a non-radial bifurcation from the trivial solution. This open problem will be
investigated in the future.

In the radial setting (see Corollary 2.2), the kernel of the linearized operator (1.9)
has a lower dimension. Its dimension however depends on A. Here we summarize some
suﬃcient conditions on the matrix A such that, in the radial setting, the kernel of the
linearized operator is two-dimensional.

Assumptions on the matrix A

Let us suppose that A satisﬁes (1.2) and (1.3). Moreover assume that there exist ¯α

and ¯ı ∈ {2, . . . , k} such that

Λ¯ı(¯α) = λn for some n > 2 (see (1.14) for the deﬁnition of λn),

Λj(¯α) 6= λn for any j /∈ {1,¯ı} and any n ∈ N,

dΛ¯ı
dα

(¯α) 6= 0.

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

Some comments on the previous assumptions: (1.18) implies that Λ¯ı(¯α) is simple and
then the function α 7→ Λ¯ı(α) is smooth in a neighborhood of ¯α (see [S] for example).
Assumption (1.19) can be reformulated in terms of dA
dα . Indeed, if en 6= 0 is an unit
eigenvector of A(¯α) for the eigenvalue λn, it is not diﬃcult to show that

en ·

dA
dα

(¯α)en =

dΛi
dα

(¯α).

(1.20)

Assumption (1.18) also implies that the kernel of the linearized operator, in this radial
setting, is two-dimensional and (1.19) gives the transversality condition of Crandall and
Rabinowitz, see [CR]. Finally, constraining further our operator to the orthogonal space
with the radial function W (|x|) = 1−|x|2
(1+|x|2)N/2 , we get a one dimensional kernel and so
Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem applies. Then the point (¯α, U, . . . , U ) is a bifurcation

A NON-VARIATIONAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE CRITICAL SOBOLEV EXPONENT

point when ¯α satisﬁes Λ¯ı(¯α) = λn for some ¯ı = 2, . . . , k and some n > 2. However
this construction produces a Lagrange multiplier for the equations satisﬁed by the zeros
of F .

The last step is to show that this Lagrange multiplier is 0. In our opinion this is one
of the interesting points of the paper and it will be done using a suitable version of the
Pohozaev identity.

The Pohozaev identity was used by many authors dealing with systems of just two
equations. The extension to the case of more equations is not straightforward and
requires the additional assumption of the invertibility of the matrix A (see section 3.3).
Now we are in position to state our bifurcation result.

Theorem 1.3. If A satisﬁes (1.2) and (1.3) and if ¯α and ¯ı verify the assumptions
(1.17)–(1.19) and if

the matrix A(¯α) is invertible,

(1.21)

then the point (¯α, U, . . . , U ) is a radial bifurcation point for the curve of trivial solu-
tions α 7→ (α, U, . . . , U ) to equation (1.1). More precisely, there exist a continuously
diﬀerentiable curve deﬁned for ε small enough

(−ε0, ε0) → R ×(cid:0)D1,2

rad(RN )(cid:1)k : ε 7→(cid:0)α(ε), u1(ε), . . . , uk(ε)(cid:1)

emanating from (¯α, U, . . . , U ), i.e., (cid:0)α(0), u1(0), . . . , uk(0)(cid:1) = (¯α, U, . . . , U ), such that,

for every ε ∈ (−ε0, ε0), u(ε) = (u1(ε), . . . , uk(ε)) is a radial solution to

(1.24)

where en is an eigenvector of A for the eigenvalue Λ¯ı(¯α) = λn, Wn is the function deﬁned

Now let us discuss the case k = 2. Here the number of degree of freedom is (k−1)k/2 =

in (2.12), and ϕε is an uniformly bounded function in (cid:0)D1,2(RN )(cid:1)k such that ϕ0 = 0.
1 and the matrix A depends on a single parameter: A =(cid:0) α 1−α
1−α α (cid:1). Its eigenvalues are

given by Λ1 = 1, Λ2 = 2α − 1. It is easily seen that (1.17)–(1.19) are veriﬁed with ¯ı = 2
and, in view of (1.14), with α = ¯αn satisfying

¯αn =

2n2 + 2N n − 2n + N 2

N (N + 2)

(1.25)

so that the degeneracy occurs at a sequence of values αn such that αn → +∞ as
n → +∞. Note that ¯αn 6= 1
2 for any n ∈ N, which implies (1.21). Hence Theorem 1.3
holds at the values αn without additional assumptions and it becomes

in D1,2(RN ) and such that ϕs,0 = 0 for s = 1, 2.

The same type of result was proved in [GGW] for the Toda system in R2.

1.3. Extensions and related problems. A ﬁrst interesting question that arises from
Proposition 1.2 concerns the existence of non-radial solutions.

Question 1. Do exist nonradial solutions to (1.1) bifurcating from the values α which

verify (1.14)? How many?

In analogy with the classiﬁcation result of Jost-Wang ([JW]), it is possible to think
that the number of solutions of (1.1) coincides with that of the linearized operator (see
also [WZZ]). In our case, if for example k = 2, we would have the existence of at least
n

(N +2h−2)(N +h−3)!

(N −2)! h!

distinct solutions.

Another interesting question concerns the shape of the branch of our solutions.

Question 2. What about the bifurcation diagram for α(ε) close to α?
This question is quite delicate and the answer seems to strongly depend on A. In
Appendix A, we carry out the computation of the ﬁrst derivative of α(ε) with respect
to ε. It is worth noting that if k = 2 then dα
dε (0) = 0 (then nothing can be said about
the behaviour of the branch) but, if k > 2, we can have that dα
dε (0) 6= 0. In this case,
the bifurcation is transcritical.

solution on Riemannian manifolds. The authors proved that only the trivial solution
(U, . . . , U ) exist.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.1 and we study
the linearization of our system at the trivial solution. In Section 3 we deﬁne the func-
tional setting, we apply the Crandall-Rabinowitz result, and we prove the Pohozaev
identity getting our bifurcation result, Theorem 1.3. Finally in the appendix, we give
some examples of possible behaviour of the branches.

2. Linearization at the standard bubble

2.1. The case of a single equation. Let us consider the critical equation (1.4) and
the associated eigenvalue problem (1.10).
It is well known that the ﬁrst eigenvalue
to (1.10) is given by λ0 = N −2
N +2 < 1 and the corresponding eigenfunction is U , while
the second eigenvalue is λ1 = 1 and it has an N + 1 dimensional kernel spanned by
∂U
2 U (see for example [BE] or [AGAP]).
In this section, we
∂x1
compute all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of (1.10).

βh is the h-th eigenvalue of −∆SN −1. It is known that

Finally, by (2.4), we deduce that Bh(Rn) and Bh(εn) go to zero and this, together with
(2.1), gives (2.3).

Then, from Lemma 2.4 of [GGN], we have that Bh(0) = 0 and

Bh(r) = O(cid:0)rνh(cid:1) as r → 0.

Let us show that an analogous estimate holds at inﬁnity. To do this set C(r) := Bh(cid:0) 1
r(cid:1).

So the claim follows if we prove that C is bounded near the origin. A straightforward
computation proves that C satisﬁes again (2.2) and (2.3). Then by (2.28) of Lemma 2.4
of [GGN] we get that

which gives

and so the claim follows.

C(r) = O(cid:0)rνh(cid:1) as r → 0,

2.2. The case of the system. Now we are in position to prove Proposition 1.2 in the
Introduction.

Proof of Proposition 1.2. Because A is symmetric, there exists an orthogonal matrix
B = (bij) such that

(2.9)
and Λ is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues (Λ1, . . . , Λk) as diagonal elements.

in RN ,

(2.10)

By our choice of the matrix B in (2.9) the k equations in (2.10) are decoupled and so we
can solve them independently. Remember that we have set Λ1 = 1. So the ﬁrst equation
of (2.10) reads

−∆w1 =

N (N + 2)
(1 + |x|2)2 w1

in RN

(2.11)

and it is well known it admits a nontrivial solution which is a linear combination of ∂U
∂xi
for i = 1, . . . , N and x · ∇U + N −2
2 U . It is important to observe that equation (2.11)
does not depend on α and so system (2.10) has the solution in (1.16) for every value
of α.

The other equations in (2.10) have a nontrivial solution if and only if Λi is an eigen-
value of problem (1.10), i.e., using Theorem 1.1 if and only if (1.14) is satisﬁed for some
i = 2, . . . , k, for some n ∈ N and for some value of α ∈ R. When (1.14) is satisﬁed
the the i-th equation in system (2.10) has as a solutions a linear combination of the
eigenfuntions of (1.10) related to the eigenvalue λn, and so (1.15) follows.
(cid:3)

One of the main hypothesis of the bifurcation result is that the kernel of the lin-
earized operator has to be one dimensional. From the previous result, we know that

A NON-VARIATIONAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE CRITICAL SOBOLEV EXPONENT

13

the linearized operator has instead a very rich kernel. To overcome this problem we
consider only the case of radial solutions in D1,2(RN ), that is, we will work in the space
D1,2

rad(RN ). First we state the result of Proposition 1.2 in this radial setting.

Corollary 2.2. Equation (1.9) possesses a radial solution v = (v1, . . . , vk) 6= (0, . . . , 0)
if and only if Λi = λn for some i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and n ∈ N, in which case the associated
radial solutions are given by v = cWn where c ∈ Rk is an eigenvector associated to the
eigenvalue Λi and

2 (cid:1)s. If several equalities of the

form Λi = λn hold at the same time, the set of radial solutions to (1.9) is the linear
span of the associated solutions of the form (2.12).

In particular, if Λ1 = 1 is a simple eigenvalue of A (which is the case under assump-
tion (1.18)), all corresponding radial solutions to equation (1.9) are given by multiples of

(1, . . . , 1) W where W (|x|) := x · ∇U + N −2

2 U = d

1 − |x|2

(1 + |x|2)N/2

(2.13)

and d = 1

2 N (N −2)/4(N − 2)(N +2)/4.

Proof. Restricting to the radial setting we have that equation (2.11) admits only the
solution in (2.13). From Theorem 1.1 instead follows that any eigenvalue λn of the
critical problem admits one radial solution wich is the one in (1.13) that correspond to
h = 0. Then (2.12) follows from (1.15).
(cid:3)

3. The bifurcation result

3.1. The functional setting. As mentioned in the introduction, the proof of our bi-
furcation result requires an appropriate functional setting which is a delicate part of the
proof.

Both for the lack of diﬀerentiability of u 7→ u+ and the diﬃculty of proving that
the solution (u1, . . . , uk) is positive, we need to restrict to a subset of D1,2(RN ) with a
stronger topology. As before let D1,2

rad(RN ) =(cid:8)u ∈ D1,2(RN )(cid:12)(cid:12) u = u(|x|)(cid:9) and set

|u(x)|
U (x)

< +∞o

D :=nu ∈ L∞(RN )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) sup

x∈RN

endowed with the norm kukD := supx∈RN

|u(x)|
U (x) and we deﬁne

X = D1,2

rad(RN ) ∩ D.

Then X is a Banach space equipped with the norm kukX := max{kuk1,2, kukD} where
kuk1,2 is the classical norm on D1,2(RN ).

To rule out the degeneracy due to the invariance under dilations of Problem (1.1),
we will solve the linearized equation in the subspace of functions that are orthogonal in

rad(RN )(cid:1)k to (1, ..., 1)W (|x|) deﬁned in (2.13). Let PK be the orthogonal projection

that satisﬁes (3.3), the ﬁnal step will be to show that L = 0 so that u is indeed a solution
to (1.1) and this will be done in the next section using a Pohozaev identity.

First we prove some properties of the operator T .

Lemma 3.2. The projector PK : X → X is well deﬁned and continuous.

Proof. Let W ∗ := W/kW k1,2. One can write PK u = u − (1, . . . , 1)W ∗Pk

i=1(ui|W ∗)D1,2.
From (2.13), one easily shows that there exists a C ∈ R such that |W ∗| 6 CU and so
kW ∗kX < +∞. The statement readily follows from these facts.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.3. The operator T in (3.2) is continuous from R × (K ∩ Bk) into K and its
derivatives ∂αT , ∂uT and ∂αuT exist and are continuous.

Proof. Since uj belongs to X, we have that u2∗−1

The solution gi enjoys the following representation:

gi(x) =

|x − y|N −2 fi(y) dy,

where ωN is the area of the unit sphere in RN . By assumption ui ∈ B and this implies
that |fi(x)| 6 CU 2∗−1(x) so that

|x − y|N −2 U 2∗−1(y) dy = CU (x)

and gi ∈ X. (Diﬀerent occurrences of C may denote diﬀerent constants.) To prove the
continuity of T in K ∩ Bk, let αn → α in R and ui,n → ui in X (for i = 1, . . . , k) as
n → ∞, and set

gi,n := (−∆)−1fi,n where fn,i :=

Since ui,n → ui in D1,2(RN ), the convergence also holds in L2∗(RN ). Using Lebesgue’s
dominated convergence theorem and its converse, one deduces that fi,n → fi in L
where fi is deﬁned as in (3.4). Therefore gi,n → gi in D1,2 and T (αn, un) → T (α, u)

because, thanks to the convergence in D, uj,n/U → uj/U uniformly for all j and the

Now we can prove our compactness result:

M (w) := (−∆)−1(cid:18)

and so M (w) ∈ D. This argument incidentally shows that M : X → X is continuous.

(3.6)

Now let (wn) be a bounded sequence in X and let us prove that, up to a subse-
quence, gn := M (wn) converges strongly to some g ∈ X. On one hand, since (wn)
is bounded in D1,2, going if necessary to a subsequence, one can assume that (wn)
converges weakly to some w in D1,2 and wn → w almost everywhere. On the other
hand, (kwnkD) is also bounded which means that |wn| 6 CU where C is indepen-

|wn|

implies that

limit on |wn| 6 CU yields w ∈ D, and passing to the limit on the inequality (3.6) for
w = wn yields g ∈ D.

It remains to show that kgn − gkD → 0. This is somewhat similar to the argument

used in Lemma 3.3. First, H¨older inequality allows us to get the estimate:

3.2. Application of the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem. In this section we will
verify the assumptions of the of the Crandall-Rabinowitz Theorem. Let us recall that
by Corollary 2.2, the linearized system (1.9) has the following radial solutions
i) (1, . . . , 1)W (due to the dilation invariance of the problem), for every α,
ii) η := enWn(|x|) where en 6= 0 satisﬁes A(¯α)en = λnen (see (2.12)) for ¯α satisfying

N −2 −ε) q

(1.14).

Notice that (1, . . . , 1) ⊥ en and so (1, . . . , 1)W ⊥ η in (D1,2)k, i.e., η ∈ K.

To apply Rabinowitz’ result, we need to verify the assumptions of Theorem 1.7 in [CR].

This is the purpose of the following lemmas.

Lemma 3.6. Let T be as deﬁned in (3.2) and assume that ¯α satisﬁes (1.17)–(1.18).

Then ker(cid:0)∂uT (¯α, U, . . . , U )(cid:1) is one dimensional and it is given by

where η = enWn,

Wn is deﬁned in (2.12), en 6= 0, and A(¯α)en = λnen.

ker(cid:0)∂uT (¯α, U, . . . , U )(cid:1) = span{η}

the case if and only if

w ∈ span(cid:8)(1, . . . , 1)W, η(cid:9).

Recalling that w ∈ K, which means that w is orthogonal to (1, . . . , 1)W , and that
η ⊥ (1, . . . , 1)W , one concludes that w is a multiple of η.

Now we are in position to apply the bifurcation result of [CR]:

A NON-VARIATIONAL SYSTEM INVOLVING THE CRITICAL SOBOLEV EXPONENT

19

Proposition 3.9. Assume that A satisﬁes (1.2) and (1.3). Assume further that there
exists ¯α and ¯ı such that (1.17)–(1.19) are satisﬁed. Then the point (¯α, U, . . . , U ) is a
radial bifurcation point for the curve α 7→ (α, U, . . . , U ) of solutions to (1.1). More
precisely, there exists continuous curves ε 7→ αε and ε 7→ (u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε), deﬁned for
ε ∈ R small enough, such that α0 = ¯α, ui,0 = U , and

for some Lagrange multiplier Lε. Moreover, for ε small enough,

(u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε) = (1, . . . , 1) U + εenWn (|x|) + εϕε(|x|)

(3.15)

where en is an eigenvector of A for the eigenvalue Λ¯ı(¯α) = λn and ϕε is an uniformly

bounded function in (cid:0)D1,2(RN )(cid:1)k and such that ϕ0 = 0.

Proof. We apply Theorem 1.7 in [CR] at the operator T deﬁned in (3.2). It is easy to see
that T (α, U, . . . , U ) = 0 for any α. By Lemma 3.3 the operators ∂αT , ∂uT and ∂α,uT
are well deﬁned and continuous from R × (K ∩ Bk) to K. Lemma 3.6 says that the
kernel of ∂uT (¯α, U, . . . , U ) is one-dimensional while Lemma 3.7 implies that its range
has codimension one. Finally, Lemma 3.8 guarantees that the transversality condition
holds. Therefore all assumptions of Theorem 1.7 in [CR] are satisﬁed. As a consequence,
there exists a neighborhood V of (¯α, U, . . . , U ) in R × (K ∩ Bk), an interval (−ε0, ε0),
and continuous functions (−ε0, ε0) → R : ε 7→ αε and (−ε0, ε0) → B : ε 7→ ϕi,ε for
i = 1, . . . , k such that α0 = ¯α, ϕi,0 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k and

T −1({0}) ∩ V =(cid:8)(α, U, . . . , U )(cid:12)(cid:12) (α, U, . . . , U ) ∈ V(cid:9) ∪(cid:8)(αε, u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε)(cid:12)(cid:12) |ε| < ε0(cid:9)

where (u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε) is deﬁned by (3.15). In particular T (αε, u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε) = 0 which
means that (u1,ε, . . . , uk,ε) solves (3.14). This concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.10. Let Lε be the Lagrange multiplier of Proposition 3.9. Then

|Lε| 6 C.

that G(u1, . . . , uk) ∈ L1(RN ) so that

(3.21)

Appendix A. Computation of the first derivative of the parameter

In this appendix we give some information on the behavior of branch of solutions of

Theorem 1.3. Let us recall that the bifurcation is called transcritical if

dαε

dε (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ε=0

Although in the literature are present formulas for the calculation of the derivative of
αε (see for example [K]), it seems diﬃcult to provide a complete characterization of
the bifurcation diagram. In next proposition we give a suﬃcient condition to have a
transcritical bifurcation.

critical.

Remark A.2. If k = 2 we have en = (1, −1) and so (A.2) is never satisﬁed.
In this
case we need reﬁned estimates involving higher order derivatives. We do not investigate
this situation. On the other hand, if k > 3 it is easy to ﬁnd matrices A verifying

Since η ∈ K, we can drop PK when performing the inner product. Thus the numerator
reads:

Xi=1

∇ −(−∆)−1(cid:18) k
Xj=1

aij(¯α) e2

n,j U2 W 2

n(cid:19)! · ∇Wn dx

Recalling that en is an eigenvector of A(¯α) for the eigenvalue Λ¯ı(¯α), one gets from (A.5)

dαε

dε (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ε=0

which gives the claim.
