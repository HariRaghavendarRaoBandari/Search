Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration astronomical radio pulses of unknown physical
origin that appear to come from extragalactic distances1–8. Previous follow-up observations
have failed to ﬁnd additional bursts at the same dispersion measures (i.e.
integrated col-
umn density of free electrons between source and telescope) and sky position as the original
detections9. The apparent non-repeating nature of the fast radio bursts has led several au-
thors to hypothesise that they originate in cataclysmic astrophysical events10. Here we report
the detection of ten additional bursts from the direction of FRB 121102, using the 305-m
Arecibo telescope. These new bursts have dispersion measures and sky positions consistent
with the original burst4. This unambiguously identiﬁes FRB 121102 as repeating and demon-
strates that its source survives the energetic events that cause the bursts. Additionally, the

1

bursts from FRB 121102 show a wide range of spectral shapes that appear to be predom-
inantly intrinsic to the source and which vary on timescales of minutes or shorter. While
there may be multiple physical origins for the population of fast radio bursts, the repeat
bursts with high dispersion measure and variable spectra speciﬁcally seen from FRB 121102
support models that propose an origin in a young, highly magnetised, extragalactic neutron
star11,12.

2

FRB 121102 was discovered4 in the PALFA survey, a deep search of the Galactic plane
at 1.4 GHz for radio pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the 305-m William E. Gordon
Telescope at the Arecibo Observatory and the 7-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA)13, 14.
The observed dispersion measure (DM) of the burst is roughly three times the maximum value
expected along this line of sight in the NE2001 model15 of Galactic electron density, i.e. βDM ≡
DMFRB/DMGal

Max ∼ 3, suggesting an extragalactic origin.

Initial Arecibo follow-up observations were limited in both dwell time and sky coverage
and resulted in no detection of additional bursts4. In 2015 May and June we carried out more
extensive follow-up using Arecibo, covering a ∼ 9(cid:48) radius with a grid of six ALFA pointings
around the then-best sky position of FRB 121102 (Figure 1 and Extended Data Table 1 and 2). As
described in the Methods, high-time-resolution, total intensity spectra were recorded, and the data
were processed using standard radio-frequency interference (RFI) excision, dispersion removal,
and single-pulse-search algorithms implemented in the PRESTO software suite and associated
data reduction pipelines14, 16, 17.

We detected 10 additional bursts from FRB 121102 in these observations. The burst prop-
erties, and those of the initial FRB 121102 burst, are listed in Table 1. The burst intensities are
shown in Figure 2. No other periodic or single-pulse signals of a plausible astrophysical origin
were detected at any other DM. Until the source’s physical nature is clear, we continue to refer to
it as FRB 121102 and label each burst chronologically starting with the original detection.

The ten newly detected bursts were observed exclusively in two adjacent sky positions of the
telescope pointing grid located ∼ 1.3(cid:48) apart (Figure 1 and Extended Data Table 1). The unweighted
average J2000 position from the centres of these two beams is right ascension α = 05h31m58s,
declination δ = +33d08m04s, with an uncertainty radius of ∼ 3(cid:48). The corresponding Galactic
longitude and latitude are l = 174◦.89, b = −0.◦23. This more accurate position is 3.7(cid:48) from the
beam centre of the discovery burst4, meaning that FRB 121102 Burst 1 was detected well off axis,
as originally concluded.

The measured DMs of all 11 bursts are consistent to within the uncertainties, and the dis-
persion indices (dispersive delay ∆t ∝ ν−ξ) match the ξ = 2.0 value expected for radio waves
traveling through a cold, ionised medium. This is strong evidence that a single astronomical source
is responsible for the events. In addition, the ∼ 0.002 DM index uncertainty we calculate for Burst
11 (see Methods) is slightly less than that reported for FRB 1105238, making this the most precise
determination of dispersion index for any FRB thus far. The upper bound on the dispersion index
is identical to that of FRB 1105238, and hence, following the same arguments used there, Burst 11
provides a similar lower limit of 10 AU for the size of the dispersive region.

The 11 bursts have peak ﬂux densities gS1400 ∼ 0.02 − 0.3 Jy at 1.4 GHz, where g is the
antenna gain at the source’s unknown location in the beam normalised to unit amplitude on the
beam axis. The other known FRBs typically have order-of-magnitude higher peak ﬂux densities
of gS1400 ∼ 0.2 − 2 Jy. The wide range of ﬂux densities seen at Arecibo, some near the detection
threshold, suggests that weaker bursts are also produced, likely at a higher rate. The rate of burst

3

detections is ∼3 hr−1 for bursts with gS1400 (cid:38) 20 mJy over all observations in which an ALFA
beam was within 3.5(cid:48) of the improved position. We note, however, that the bursts appear to cluster
in time with some observing sessions showing multiple bright bursts and others showing none.

The observed burst full widths at half maximum are w50 = 2.8−8.7 ms, which are consistent
with the w50 = 1.3 − 23.4 ms widths seen from other FRBs. No clear evidence for scatter broad-
ening was seen in any of the bursts. Bursts 8 and 10 show double-peaked proﬁles, which has also
been seen in FRB 1210027. Furthermore, the morphologies of Bursts 8 and 10 evolve smoothly
with frequency.

Within our observing band (1.214 − 1.537 GHz) the burst spectra are remarkably variable.
Some are brighter toward higher frequencies, as in the initial discovery, Burst 1, while others
are brighter toward lower frequencies. The spectra of Bursts 8 and 10 are not monotonic. The
detections of Bursts 6–11 exclusively in Beam 0 of the ALFA receiver (see Extended Data Table
1) means that the bursts must have been detected in the main beam and not in a side-lobe. While
the frequency-dependent shape of the main beam attenuates the bursts’ intrinsic spectra at higher
frequencies if the source is off-axis4, this bias is either not large enough or in the wrong direction
to cause the observed spectral variability of Bursts 6–11. Given our improved position, Burst 1
is consistent with its detection in a side-lobe, which, unlike in the main beam, could have caused
attenuation of the spectrum at lower frequencies. This spectral volatility is reﬂected by the wide
range of spectral indices α ∼ −10 to +14 obtained from ﬁtting a power-law model (Sν ∝ να,
where Sν is the ﬂux density at frequency ν) to burst spectra (Table 1).

There is no evidence for ﬁne-scale diffractive interstellar scintillation, most likely because it
is unresolved by our limited spectral resolution. In principle, the spectra could be strongly modu-
lated if the source is multiply imaged by refraction in the interstellar medium18 or by gravitational
lensing. However, the splitting angle between sub-images required to produce spectral structure
across our band ((cid:28) 1 milli-arcsecond) is much smaller than the expected diffraction angle from
interstellar plasma scattering. The ﬁne-scaled diffraction structure in the spectrum will therefore
wash out the oscillation. Lastly, positive spectral indices could also be explained by free-free ab-
sorption at the source19, but this is ruled out by the large spectral differences among bursts. We
therefore conclude that the spectral shapes and variations are likely to be predominantly intrinsic
to the source.

An analysis of the arrival times of the bursts did not reveal any statistically signiﬁcant pe-
riodicity (see Methods). If the source has a long period ((cid:38) 1 s), then it is likely emitting at a
wide range of rotational phases, which is not uncommon for magnetars20, making a convincing
period determination difﬁcult. Due to the small number of detected bursts, we are not sensitive to
periodicities much shorter than ∼ 100 ms.

Repeat bursts rule out models involving cataclysmic events – such as merging neutron stars21
or collapsing supra-massive neutron stars10. Bursts from Galactic ﬂare stars have been proposed
as a model for FRBs with the DM excess originating in the stellar corona22. However, temporal
density variations in the corona should produce bursts with varying DMs, which we do not observe.

4

Planets orbiting in a magnetised pulsar wind may produce a millisecond-duration burst once per
orbital period23; however, the observed intra-session separations of our bursts (23 to 572 s) are
too short to correspond to orbital periods. Repeated powerful radiative bursts are associated with
magnetars, and indeed giant ﬂares from the latter have been suggested as a FRB source12, 19, 24.
However, no Galactic magnetar has been seen to emit more than a single giant ﬂare in over four
decades of monitoring, arguing against a magnetar giant ﬂare origin for FRB 121102. Magnetars
have been observed to exhibit repeating bright radio pulses20, however not yet at the energy scale
implied if FRB 121102 is more than several hundred kpc away.

Giant pulse emission from an extragalactic pulsar remains a plausible model11. The most
prominent giant pulses are from the Crab pulsar, which has a large spin-down energy loss rate.
Spectral indices calculated from wideband measurements of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar25
have a broad distribution ranging from α ∼ −15 to +10, as well as frequency “fringes” – i.e.
a banded structure to the emission brightness as a function of frequency26. These fringes have
characteristic widths of a few hundred MHz, and we speculate that – given our 322-MHz ob-
serving bandwidth – a similar phenomenon could create the spectral variability we have seen in
FRB 121102. The double-peaked nature of some FRB 121102 bursts is also possible in the giant
pulse model7, and the evolution of these burst morphologies with frequency could imply rapid
spectral variation between consecutive (sub-)pulses only milliseconds apart.

The low Galactic latitude and relatively small βDM of FRB 121102 compared with other
FRBs raises the question whether it is genuinely extragalactic in origin (see also Methods). How-
ever, no Hα or HII regions are seen in archival data along the line of sight to FRB 121102, as might
be expected for an intervening ionised nebula4 that can give βDM (cid:29) 1. Furthermore, a detailed
multi-wavelength investigation, which searched for a compact nebula in a sky region that includes
the reﬁned position presented here, concluded that FRB 121102’s high DM cannot be explained
by unmodelled Galactic structure along the line of sight and that FRB 121102 must therefore be
extragalactic19. Conclusively establishing that FRB 121102 is extragalactic will require arcsecond
localisation and association with a host galaxy. The repeating nature of the bursts facilitates such
localisation with a radio interferometer.

While the FRB 121102 bursts share many similarities to the FRBs detected using the Parkes1–3, 5–7

and Green Bank8 telescopes, it is unclear whether FRB 121102 is representative of all FRBs. The
10 bursts from FRB 121102 in 2015 were detected near the best-known position in 3 hrs of obser-
vations. In contrast, follow-up observations of the Parkes FRBs, again using the Parkes telescope,
range in total time per direction from a few hours9 to almost 100 hours1 and have found no ad-
ditional bursts. Arecibo’s > 10× higher sensitivity may allow detection of a broader range of
the burst-energy distribution of FRBs, thus increasing the chances of detecting repeated bursts;
for example, of the 11 bursts from FRB 121102, Parkes may have been capable of detecting only
Bursts 8 or 11. More sensitive observations of the Parkes FRBs may therefore show that they also
sporadically repeat.

Alternatively, FRB 121102 may be fundamentally different from the FRBs detected at Parkes
and Green Bank. As was the case for supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, multiple astrophysical

5

processes may be required to explain a diversity of observational properties of FRBs.

Positional gridding strategy and burst localisation

Extended Data Table 1 summarises all the observations made in both the initial 2013 follow-up and
2015 May/June observations (project code p2886). The ALFA Beam 0 pointing positions in J2000
equatorial coordinates are summarised in Extended Data Table 2. In p2030/p2886 observations,
the major axis of the ALFA receiver was rotated 19◦/90◦ with respect to North4.

In 2015 May/June, we searched for additional bursts from FRB 121102 using a grid of six
pointings using the seven-beam ALFA receiver to cover a generous ∼ 9(cid:48) radius around the discov-
ery beam position and side-lobe. The ALFA receiver was aligned East-West to optimise the sky
coverage for this speciﬁc purpose. The centre beams of the six grid pointings are shown in red in
Figure 1, and the six outer ALFA beams are shown in blue. Each grid pointing position was ob-
served at least four times for ∼ 1000 s. The beam positions of the discovery observation and 2013
follow-up gridding4 with ALFA (in that case rotated 19◦ with respect to North) are also indicated
using the same colour scheme. The outer six ALFA beams in the multiple grid observations are
only at roughly the same position because the projection of the ALFA beams on the sky depends
on the position of the telescope feed with respect to the primary reﬂecting dish, and these do not
overlap perfectly between independent observations.

Two bursts on May 17 (Bursts 2 and 3) and two on June 2 (Bursts 4 and 5) were detected
at a single grid position: FRBGRID2b in ALFA Beam 6, which had positions of α = 05h32m01s,
δ = +33d07m56s and α = 05h32m01s, δ = +33d07m53s (J2000) at the two epochs – i.e. only
a few arcseconds apart. Six more bursts (Bursts 6–11) were detected on June 2 at a neighbouring
grid position, FRBGRID6b in ALFA Beam 0, ∼ 1.3(cid:48) away at α = 05h31m55s, δ = +33d08m13s.
In all cases bursts were detected in only one beam of the seven-beam ALFA receiver at any given
time. This shows that the bursts must originate beyond Arecibo’s Fresnel length of ∼ 100 km19.

The intermittency of FRB 121102 makes accurate localisation more challenging. Nonethe-
less, the detection in adjacent grid positions is informative, and to reﬁne the position of FRB 121102,
we simply take the average position between FRBGRID2b ALFA Beam 6 and FRBGRID6b ALFA
Beam 0, which gives: α = 05h31m58s, declination δ = +33d08m04s (J2000) and, equivalently,
Galactic longitude and latitude l = 174◦.89, b = −0.◦23. The approximate uncertainty radius of
∼ 3(cid:48) is based on the amount of overlap between the two detection beam positions and the ALFA
beam width at half power, which is ∼ 3.5(cid:48). The distance from the initially reported Burst 1 posi-
tion is 3.7(cid:48), consistent with the interpretation that this burst was detected in a side-lobe. Though
FRB 121102 bursts have been detected in beams with different central sky positions, all detections
are consistent with a well deﬁned sky position when one considers the imprint of the ALFA gain
pattern on the sky during each observation4.

Galactic versus extragalactic interpretation

Noteworthy is the fact that FRB 121102 lies directly in the Galactic plane, whereas the other
claimed FRBs lie predominantly at high Galactic latitudes. The PALFA survey is only searching
in the Galactic plane, however, and no comparable FRB survey at 1.4 GHz with Arecibo has been
done at high Galactic latitudes. Therefore, this difference may simply be a consequence of where
Arecibo has most deeply searched for FRBs and does not necessarily suggest that FRB 121102 is
of Galactic origin. Furthermore, FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-centre region of the
PALFA survey, whereas searches in the inner-Galaxy region have thus far found no FRBs14. This
may be because the Galactic foregrounds in the anti-centre region are comparatively low, so the
deleterious effects of DM smearing and scattering, which may reduce our sensitivity to FRBs, are
less important in the outer Galaxy than inner Galaxy.

The low Galactic latitude of FRB 121102 also contributes to its low DM excess factor
βDM ∼ 3 compared to the βDM ∼ 1.2 − 40 range seen for the other 15 FRBs in the literature.
Only FRB 01062127, with βDM ∼ 1.2, has a lower βDM than FRB 121102, and it has been pro-
posed to be Galactic28. We note, however, that six of 16 FRBs have DMs comparable to or lower
than FRB 121102. Furthermore, its total Galactic DM excess DMFRB − DMGal
Max ∼ 370 pc cm−3
is larger than that of the ﬁrst-discovered FRB1. Lastly, within a generous 20-degree radius of
FRB 121102, the highest-DM pulsar known is the millisecond pulsar PSR J0557+155029 (also a
PALFA discovery), which has DM= 103 pc cm−3 and βDM = 0.6, as well as the highest DM-
inferred distance15 of any pulsar in this region, d = 5.7 kpc. FRB 121102’s DM is clearly anoma-
lous, even when compared to this distant Galactic anti-centre pulsar. At an angular offset of 38
degrees, we note the existence of PSR J0248+6021, with DM= 370 pc cm−3 and βDM = 1.8.
While the DM of this young, 217-ms pulsar is in excess of the maximum Galactic contribution in
the NE2001 model15, this can be explained by its location within the dense, giant HII region W5 in
the Perseus arm30 at a distance of 2 kpc. A similar association for FRB 121102 has been sought to
explain its βDM ∼ 3, but multi-wavelength investigations have as yet found no unmodelled Galac-
tic structure4, 19. In summary, FRB 121102’s comparatively low βDM does not strongly distinguish
it from other FRBs, or necessarily suggest it is more likely to be Galactic.

Observations and search processing

Here we provide a brief description of the Arecibo Mock spectrometer data and search pipeline14
used for our follow-up observations of FRB 121102. The 1.4-GHz data were recorded with the
Mock spectrometers, which cover the full ALFA receiver bandwidth in two subbands. Each 172-
MHz subband was sampled with 16 bits, a time resolution of 65.5 µs, and frequency resolution
of 0.34 MHz in 512 channels. The data were later converted to 4-bit samples to reduce the data
storage requirements. Before processing, the two subbands were combined into a single band
of 322 MHz (accounting for frequency overlap between the two subbands), which was centred at
1375 MHz and spans (1214.3 – 1536.7 MHz).

14

We used the PALFA PRESTO-based16 search pipeline14 to search for astrophysical signals
in the frequency and time domains. These data were processed using the McGill University High
Performance Computing Centre operated by Compute Canada and Calcul Qu´ebec. The pres-
ence of radio frequency interference (RFI) can have a detrimental effect on our ability to detect
bursts. We therefore applied PRESTO’s rfifind to identify contaminated frequency channels
and time blocks. Flagged channels and time blocks were masked in subsequent analyses. Time
blocks contaminated by RFI are identiﬁed using data that are not corrected for dispersive delay
(i.e. DM= 0 pc cm−3), in order to avoid removing astrophysical signals. The data were corrected
for dispersion using 7292 trial DMs ranging from 0 to 9866.4 pc cm−3, generating a time series at
each trial. We performed Fourier analyses of all the time series to look for periodic signals using
PRESTO’s accelsearch and detected no signiﬁcant signal of a plausible astrophysical origin.

We searched for single pulses in each dispersion-corrected time series by convolving a tem-
plate bank of boxcar functions with widths ranging from 0.13 to 100 ms. This optimises the detec-
tion of pulses with durations longer than the native sample time of the data. Single-pulse events at
each DM were identiﬁed by applying a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold of 5.

These single-pulse events were grouped and ranked using the RRATtrap sifting algorithm17.
An astrophysical pulse is detected with maximum S/N at the signal’s true DM and is detected with
decreasing S/N at nearby trial DMs. This is not generally the case for RFI, whose S/N does not
typically peak at a non-zero trial DM. The RRATtrap algorithm ranks candidates based on this
DM behaviour and candidate plots are produced for highly ranked single-pulse groups. These
plots display the signiﬁcance of the pulse as a function of DM and time as well as an image of
the signal as a function of time and observing frequency (e.g. Figure 2). The resulting plots were
inspected for astrophysical signals, and pulses were found at a DM of ∼ 559 pc cm−3 at a sky
position consistent with the discovery position of FRB 1211024. It is possible that the analysed
data contain weaker bursts, which cannot be reliably identiﬁed because their S/N is too low to
distinguish them from RFI or statistical noise. If, in the future, the bursts are shown to have an
underlying periodicity, then this would enable a deeper search for weak bursts.

Timing analysis of burst arrival times

Using several approaches, we searched for an underlying periodicity matching the arrival times of
the eight bursts detected in the 2015 June 2 observing session. There are no signiﬁcant periodicities
detected through a standard Fast Fourier Transform of the time series. We then carried out a similar
analysis to that routinely used to detect periodicities in sporadically emitting radio pulsars31. In this
analysis, we calculate differences between all of the burst arrival times and search for the greatest
common denominator of these differences. We found several periods, not harmonically related,
that ﬁt different subsets of bursts within a tolerance of 1% of the trial period, but none that ﬁt
all of the bursts. We subsequently calculated residuals for the times-of-arrival for the eight bursts
detected on 2015 June 2 for a range of trial periods using the pulsar timing packages TEMPO and
PINT. We found that some of the periods returned by the differencing algorithm also resulted in

15

residuals with root-mean-square (RMS) of less than 1% of the trial period. However, there were
many non-harmonically related candidate periods resulting in residuals of a comparable RMS.
Furthermore, given the number of trials necessary for this search, none of these trial periods was
statistically signiﬁcant. In addition, due to the small number of detected bursts, and the widths
of the pulses, we were not sensitive to periodicities much shorter than ∼ 100 ms as our tolerance
for a period match (or acceptable RMS) becomes a large fraction of the period and there are
many possible ﬁts. The 16-day gap between the 2015 May and June detections precluded us from
including the May bursts in any search for periodicity in the single pulses.

Spectral ﬁtting

In order to produce the spectra shown in the right panels of Figure 2, we corrected each spectrum
for the bandpass of the receiver. We estimated the bandpass by taking the average of the raw data
samples for each frequency channel. We then median-ﬁltered that average bandpass with a width
of 20 channels to remove the effects of narrow-band RFI and divided the observed spectrum of
each burst by this median-ﬁltered bandpass. The band-corrected burst spectra shown in the right
sub-panels of Figure 2 are still somewhat contaminated by RFI, however. The bottom and top 10
channels (3.4 MHz) of the band were ignored due to roll-off in the receiver response.

To characterise the bandpass-corrected spectrum of each burst, we applied a power-law
model using least-squares ﬁtting. The power-law model is described by Sν ∝ να, where Sν is
the ﬂux density in a frequency channel, ν is the observing frequency, and α is the spectral index.
These measured spectral indices and their uncertainties are shown in Table 1. We do not include
a spectral index value for Burst 6 because of the RFI in the lower half of the band. For Bursts 7
and 9, we exclude data below 1250 MHz, because of RFI contamination. For Bursts 8 and 10, the
power-law model was not a good descriptor, and therefore no value is reported in Table 1.

Note, we veriﬁed this technique by applying the bandpass correction to PALFA data of pulsar
B1900+01. The measured spectral index was calculated for ten, bright single pulses, and the values
are consistent with the published value.

Measurement of dispersion measure and index

We measured the DM for 10 of the 11 bursts and additionally the dispersion index (dispersive
delay ∆t ∝ ν−ξ) for the brightest two. The DM and DM index, ξ, were calculated with a least-
squares routine using the SIMPLEX and MIGRAD functions from the CERN MINUIT package
(http://www.cern.ch/minuit). The user speciﬁes the assumed form of the intrinsic pulse shape,
which is then convolved with the appropriate DM smearing factor. For these ﬁts a boxcar pulse
template was used.

Subbanded pulse proﬁles for each burst were generated by averaging blocks of frequency

16

channels (i.e. frequency scrunching). The number of subbands generated depended on the S/N of
the burst to ensure that there was sufﬁcient S/N in each subband for the ﬁt to converge. Subbands
with no signal were excluded from the ﬁt. Furthermore, the data were binned in time to further
increase the S/N and reduce the effects of frequency-dependent ﬂux evolution. As the true intrin-
sic pulse width is not known, each burst was ﬁt with a range of boxcar widths. The parameters
corresponding to the input template yielding the cleanest residuals are reported.

The DM value was ﬁt keeping the DM index ﬁxed at 2.0. Note, Burst 7 was too weak
and corrupted by RFI to obtain reasonable ﬁts. Additionally, for the brightest two bursts (8 and
11), we also did a joint ﬁt of DM and DM index. The resulting DM index ﬁts were 2.00±0.02
and 1.999±0.002 for Burst 8 and 11, respectively. These values are as expected for radio waves
traveling through a cold, ionised medium

Frequency-dependent pulse proﬁle evolution introduces systematic biases into the times of
arrival in each subband. These biases in turn bias the DM determination. These systematics cannot
be mitigated without an accurate model for the underlying burst shape versus frequency, which is
not available in this case, and is further complicated by the fact that the burst morphology also
changes randomly from burst to burst. We estimated the systematic uncertainty by considering
what DM value would produce a delay across our observing band that is comparable to half the
burst width in each case.

Table 1 presents the results of the ﬁts with the statistical and systematic uncertainties both
quoted. The DM estimates do not include barycentric corrections (of order 0.01 to 0.1 pc cm−3).
Although FRB 121102 is close to the ecliptic, the angular separation from the Sun was always
much larger than 10 degrees, and any annual contribution to the DM from the solar wind was
small (< 10−3 pc cm−3)32, 33. These effects are, therefore, much smaller than the aforementioned
systematics in modelling the DMs of the bursts.

The ±1-σ range of DMs for the 10 new bursts is 558.1 ± 3.3 pc cm−3, consistent with the
discovery value4, 557.4 ± 2.0 pc cm−3. The DMs and DM index reported here and previously4
were calculated using different methods. These two approaches ﬁt for different free parameters, so
different co-variances between parameters may result in slightly different values. Also, different
time and frequency resolutions were used. Nonetheless, the Burst 1 parameters quoted here and
previously4 are consistent within the uncertainties. The consistency of the DMs is conclusive
evidence that a single source is responsible for the events.

The role of interstellar scattering

Some FRBs have shown clear evidence for multi-path propagation from scattering by the inter-
vening interstellar or extragalactic material along the line of sight2, 6–8. However, the burst proﬁles
from FRB 121102 show no obvious evidence for asymmetry from multi-path propagation. An
upper bound on the pulse broadening time from Burst 1 is 1.5 ms at 1.5 GHz4. Using the NE2001
model for a source far outside the Galaxy, the expected pulse broadening is ∼ 20µs ν−4.4 with ν

17

in GHz, an order of magnitude smaller than the ∼ 2 ms pulse widths and ∼ 0.7 ms intra-channel
dispersion smearing. The features of the spectra can not be explained by diffractive interstellar
scintillations; the predicted scintillation bandwidth for FRB 121102 is ∼50 kHz at 1.5 GHz, which
is unresolved by the 0.34 MHz frequency channels of our data. We would, therefore, also not ex-
pect to observe diffractive interstellar scintillation in our bursts. Additional scattering occurring in
a host galaxy and the intergalactic medium is at a level below our ability to detect. However, obser-
vations at frequencies below 1.5 GHz may reveal pulse broadening that is not substantially smaller
than the upper bound if we use as a guide the observed pulse broadening from other FRBs2, 6–8. Fu-
ture observations that quantify diffractive interstellar scintillations can provide constraints on the
location of extragalactic scattering plasma relative to the source, as demonstrated for FRB 1105238.

The upper bound on pulse broadening for FRB 121102 implies that the apparent, scattered
source size for radio waves incident on the Milky Way’s ISM is small enough so that refractive
interstellar scintillation (RISS) from the ISM is expected. For the line of sight to FRB 121102 we
use the NE2001 model to estimate an effective scattering-screen distance of ∼ 2 kpc from Earth and
a scattering diameter of 6 mas. The implied length scale for phase-front curvature is then lRISS ∼
2 kpc×6 mas = 12 AU. For an effective, nominal velocity, Veﬀ = 100V100 km s−1, the expected
RISS time scale is ∆tRISS = lISS/Veﬀ = 215 V −1
1 GHz days. At 1.5 GHz and an effective velocity
due to Galactic rotation, which is about 200 km s−1 in the direction of FRB 121102, RISS time
scales of 20–40 days are expected. Modulation from RISS can be several tens of percent34. This
could play a role in the detections of bursts in 2015 mid-May and 2015 June and their absence
in 2015 early-May and at other epochs. However, the solar system and the ionised medium have
the same Galactic rotation, so the effective velocity could be smaller than 100 km s−1, leading to
longer RISS time scales.
