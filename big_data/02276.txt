ABSTRACT

Field reddenings are summarized for 68 Cepheids from published studies and updated results presented
here. The compilation forms the basis for a comparison with other published reddening scales of Cepheids,
including those established from reddening-independent indices, photometry on the Lick six-color system,
Str¨omgren system, Walraven system, Washington system, Cape BVI system, DDO system, and Geneva
system, IRSB studies, and Cepheid spectroscopy, both old and new. Reddenings tied to period-color relations
are the least reliable, as expected, while photometric color excesses vary in precision, their accuracy depending
on the methodology and calibration sample. The tests provide insights into the accuracy and precision of
published Cepheid reddening scales, and lead to a new system of standardized reddenings comprising a
sample of 198 variables with an average uncertainty of ±0.028 in EB−V , the precision being less than ±0.01
for many. The collected color excesses are used to map the dispersion in intrinsic colors as a function of
pulsation period, the results contradicting current perceptions about the period dependence of dispersion in
Cepheid eﬀective temperatures.

INTRODUCTION

Classical Cepheids are pulsating yellow supergiants
that make ideal standard candles for distance estimates
because of the fairly tight relationship that exists be-
tween their luminosities and periods of pulsation — the
period-luminosity relation, also referred to as the Leav-
itt law when expressed as absolute magnitude versus pe-
riod. The general properties of Cepheids consequently
make them of considerable importance for the reliability
of the distance scale. That, in turn, has inspired a quest,
still ongoing, to delineate the Cepheid instability strip as
accurately as possible (see Turner 2012b). As noted by
Turner, MacLellan & Henden (2011), an empirical de-
scription of the instability strip has been diﬃcult to
establish because of complications arising from Galac-
tic reddening and extinction; extinction alone represents
an overlooked obstacle because of the prescriptive fash-
ion by which it is often applied (see Turner 2014). But
the creation of an accurate scale of Cepheid reddenings
(color excesses) represents an important ﬁrst step.

Historically the color excesses of Cepheids have been
established using ﬁeld reddenings derived from photo-
metric and spectroscopic observations of their nearby
early-type companions, using photometric or spec-
trophotometric observations of the variables in cali-
brated reddening-independent systems, from compari-
son of their cyclical spectroscopic and photometric vari-
ations with derived intrinsic colors for supergiants of
comparable spectral types, and from simple period-color
relations tied to a few standard Cepheids calibrated by

the previous methods. Each method is fraught with
diﬃculties arising from uncertainties in the methods
of establishing intrinsic colors for luminous stars of all
types, as well as dereddening them, given that few are
close enough in the Galactic plane to be unaﬀected by
the contaminating eﬀects of nearby dust clouds.

The last technique, however, suﬀers from a more
fundamental problem:
the intrinsic width of the in-
stability strip in eﬀective temperature, combined with
the fact that stars of identical mean radius (or pulsa-
tion period) lie diagonally across the strip over a range
of mean eﬀective temperatures,
implies that stars of
identical period can have quite diﬀerent intrinsic col-
ors,
in conﬂict with the basic premise of a period-
color relation. Coincidentally, many well-studied bright
Cepheids have large light amplitudes, and such vari-
ables are usually found in the more constricted re-
gion of eﬀective temperature lying close to and slightly
warmer than the center line of the instability strip (see
Turner, Abdel-Sabour Abdel-Latif & Berdnikov 2006a).
Adoption of period-color relations to deredden Cepheids
can therefore yield reasonable color excesses in some
cases, namely Cepheids of large amplitude, although the
scatter inherent to the methodology must propagate into
uncertainties for individual stars.

The accuracy and precision of reddenings for early-
type stars have gradually improved over the past 60
years through developments in dereddening techniques
and more reliable intrinsic colors. In parallel to such ad-
vances, Kovtyukh et al. (2008) have increased the pre-
cision of spectroscopic parameters for Cepheids and yel-

1

low supergiants through use of as many temperature-
sensitive and gravity-sensitive line ratios as permitted
by the dimensions of their observational spectral win-
dows. Their technique eliminates any dependence on
adopted reddening relations by matching stellar atmo-
sphere models to Cepheid spectra over their cycles to
infer eﬀective temperatures, and hence intrinsic colors,
for comparison with observed colors. Older versions of
Cepheid dereddening procedures from spectra were gen-
erally of much lower precision.

An oft-cited source of Cepheid reddenings was estab-
lished 25 years ago by Fernie (1990a) and used to study
the Cepheid instability strip (Fernie 1990b). The in-
trinsic relations adopted for that compilation were cal-
ibrated using a variety of diﬀerent procedures noted
above (Fernie 1987), resulting in zero-point oﬀsets with
respect to other reddening calibrations of that era.
Turner (1995), for example, noted the existence of sys-
tematic oﬀsets in reddening for some Cepheids, notably
long period variables.

The importance of accurate Cepheid reddenings has
been pointed out previously (Turner & Burke 2002;
Turner 2010, 2012b). A Cepheid’s mean radius is closely
related to its pulsation period according to indepen-
dent studies using the Baade-Wesselink method and
its variants (Laney & Stobie 1993; Gieren et al. 1998;
Arellano Ferro & Rosenzweig
2000; Turner & Burke
2002; Turner et al. 2010), while its average eﬀective
temperature can be established fairly reliably from
its unreddened broad band B–V color (Gray 1992;
Turner & Burke 2002), as also argued by Fry & Carney
(1999).
Combining the two values then yields a
Cepheid’s mean luminosity according to the standard re-
lationship, hLi = 4πhRi2σhTeﬀ i4, where angular brack-
ets denote averages over the pulsation cycle. The
Cepheid period-luminosity relation can therefore be
constructed from basic information on the pulsation
period and reddening of Cepheids in combination with
observed B–V colors (Turner 2012b). The distribution
of Cepheids in period-color space can also be established
in similar fashion (see Turner 2001, 2010) to provide an
empirical description of the Cepheid instability strip.

The gradual growth in ﬁeld reddenings for Galactic
Cepheids (e.g., Laney & Caldwell 2007) has made it pos-
sible to make detailed comparisons of existing reddening
compilations in order to examine the accuracy and pre-
cision of each. The present study was therefore initi-
ated in order to compile all available ﬁeld reddenings for
Cepheids, to redo any where reanalysis was warranted,
and to use the resulting system of reddenings to examine
in detail a selection of existing reddening compilations,
including those often cited for the extragalactic Cepheid
calibration.

2. THE REDDENING SYSTEM

The reddening system established here is based upon
the growing collection of space reddenings for Cepheids
that has developed over the past thirty-ﬁve years, mostly
as by-products of photometric studies of open clusters
and associations containing Cepheids as potential cal-
ibrators for the period-luminosity relation. The collec-
tion is not complete (several studies are still in progress),
but is large enough for the present purpose.

Reddenings were rederived for a selection of Cepheids
studied previously, namely those of Feltz & McNamara
(1976), Turner (1980a), Turner et al. (2005), and Turner
(2013). The analyses made use of Str¨omgren system
data transformed to the UBV system as described by
Turner (1990) — see, as an example, Turner (2012a), —
existing data, and BV data supplemented by new CCD
observations from the AAVSO (American Association
of Variable Star Observers) Photometric All-Sky Survey
(APASS).

Thirty years ago it was common practice to adopt in-
trinsic UBV colors for A-type dwarfs from compilations
such as those of Johnson (1966) and FitzGerald (1970).
Later studies (Collins & Smith 1985; Peacock & Smith
1987) revealed that such colors are likely to be biased
by a mix of stars having diﬀerent rotational veloci-
ties and projection angles. True zero-age zero-rotation
main-sequence (ZAZRMS) stars of spectral types A
and F have colors that diﬀer systematically from those
of Johnson (1966) and FitzGerald (1970) according to
Peacock & Smith (1987), although the standardization
for the latter study was mistakenly tied to A0 stars with

2

colors aﬀected by a zero-point oﬀset. True ZAZRMS col-
ors for dwarfs were therefore recompiled by smoothing
the colors for OB and KM stars from Johnson (1966) and
FitzGerald (1970), renormalizing the Peacock & Smith
(1987) Johnson and Str¨omgren system intrinsic color
predictions for non-rotating AF dwarfs to A0 stars with
[(B − V )0, (U − B)0] = [0.00, 0.00], and adding the col-
ors for unreddened Pleiades GK dwarfs (roughly solar
metallicity) from the study by Turner (1977b).

The resulting UBV colors were shown previously
to match the observed colors of OB and AF stars in
uniformly-reddened open clusters (Turner 1996). Prior
to that they were tested and conﬁrmed using observed
colors for large samples of BAF-type stars from the Pho-
toelectric Catalogue of Blanco et al. (1970). Only stars
considered to have UBV photometry properly tied to
the Johnson system were used for testing. The resulting
intrinsic ZAZRMS relation is shown in Figs. 2 & 3 of
Turner (1996) and here in Fig. 1, but for the beneﬁt of
potential users is also tabulated in Table 1. Fig. 1 de-
picts existing and transformed UBV data used to estab-
lish new space reddenings for the eight Cepheids noted
above.

An overlooked feature of

interstellar reddening is
that no single relationship accurately describes it
over all regions of the Galaxy (Wampler 1961, 1962;
Mathis 1990; Turner 1989, 1994; Zagury 2012, 2013;
Turner, Majaess & Balam 2014). Regional variations
in reddening law display an inherent dependence upon
direction viewed through the Galaxy, so the redden-
ings derived in the color-color diagrams of Fig. 1 were
inferred using reddening laws, i.e., EU −B/EB−V , appro-
priate for each ﬁeld. The corresponding color excesses
for the Cepheids were also adjusted from their averaged
equivalent B0-star reddenings using the transformation
of Fernie (1963). Such corrections are fairly straight-
forward given that the mean colors of each Cepheid are
known, but do depend upon the accuracy of the adopted
Fernie (1963) relationship.

Another misconception is that reddening increases
linearly with distance (e.g., Laney & Caldwell 2007),
whereas in reality reddening increases discretely when-
ever the line of sight crosses an interstellar (dust) cloud
causing extinction (see Turner et al. 2011). In some di-
rections, such as a few degrees away from the Galac-
tic equator, all reddened stars may be aﬀected by
light passing through only one relatively nearby dust
cloud, no matter how distant they lie beyond the cloud.
That makes the derivation of space reddening for many
Cepheids relatively uncomplicated. They need not be-
long to a cluster or association, as long as there are some
early-type stars in the same line of sight.

A problem arose with the reddening for the Cepheids
QZ Nor and V340 Nor, associated with the open clus-
ter NGC 6067. Majaess et al. (2013a) adopted red-
denings of EJ −H = 0.13 for the cluster and Cepheids

Fig. 1.— Existing and transformed UBV data for stars sur-
rounding eight Cepheids. The intrinsic ZAZRMS color-color
relation is shown (in black) in each case, along with the same
relation reddened by the average B0-star color excess (indi-
cated in each case and depicted by the gray lines) for stars
associated with each Cepheid.

based upon a spectroscopic reddening of EB−V (B0) =
0.35 ± 0.04 tied to spectra and UBV photometry by
Thackeray, Wesselink & Harding (1962) for NGC 6067.
A re-examination of the UBV colors for cluster stars
from Thackeray et al. (1962) and Pedreros (1984) in con-
junction with a likely reddening law for the ﬁeld (see
Turner 1976c; Turner et al. 2014) revealed that the clus-
ter displays diﬀerential reddening. Color excesses for
cluster stars vary from EB−V = 0.30 to EB−V = 0.48,
with most stars reddened by 0.36–0.42. The EJ −H red-
dening adopted by Majaess et al. (2013a) corresponds
to EB−V = 0.42 with the relations of Turner (2011),
in contrast to the mean spectroscopic reddening. Since
V340 Nor lies in the nuclear region of NGC 6067 while
QZ Nor is a coronal member, the ﬁeld reddening for both
Cepheids must be examined separately.

The available data for stars lying within 2 arcmin
of each Cepheid were therefore reanalyzed using the

3

methodology described previously (see also Turner
1996). The observations were primarily the UBV data
of Thackeray et al. (1962) and Pedreros (1984), BV data
from APASS, and JHKs data (Cutri et al. 2003) from
the 2MASS survey (Skrutskie et al. 2006). Stars near
V340 Nor displayed a reddening of EB−V = 0.39 ± 0.02
(transformed from EJ −H = 0.115 ± 0.005), which was
adopted for the Cepheid space reddening given in Ta-
ble 2. There were fewer stars available to test the space
reddening near QZ Nor, but they did appear to be con-
sistent with a color excess identical to that for V340 Nor.
That reddening was therefore adopted for the space red-
dening of QZ Nor in Table 2.

The sample of 68 Cepheids of known space redden-
ing is summarized in Table 2, where the sources used
to establish the color excesses are indicated in the Ta-
ble notes. The reddening of each Cepheid is based upon
studies of the surrounding ﬁeld in which the exact form
of the reddening law in the ﬁeld was (usually) established
beforehand. The space reddening sample is clearly quite
extensive, although a few of the Cepheids are of uncer-
tain use given questions about their population types
(see Turner et al. 2011).

3. TESTING THE SAMPLE

The Cepheid space reddenings of Table 2 were ﬁrst

compared with the color excesses of Turner, Leonard & English
(1987), which were derived using reddening-independent
KHG data from Feltz & McNamara (1980) in conjunc-
tion with a small set of space reddenings by Turner
(1984), where some of the latter diﬀer slightly from the
values presented here. There are 16 stars in common to
the two data samples, the comparison being depicted in
Fig. 2 (top). The photometric KHG index of Brigham
Young University is essentially independent of inter-
stellar reddening (see discussion by Turner et al. 1987),
and KHG reddenings depend upon Cepheid space red-
denings only for calibration purposes. They therefore
make a useful ﬁrst test of the reddening compilation
being established here.

A combination of least squares and non-parametric
straight line ﬁts to the data of Fig. 2 (top) gave the
formal results summarized in Table 3 and depicted in
the ﬁgure. Despite small diﬀerences in the reddenings of
the calibrating objects for the original KHG reddenings
(Turner et al. 1987), they appear to agree closely enough
with the Table 2 data to be considered a reasonable
match. Thereafter, the color excesses from Turner et al.
(1987) were used as published to augment the system of
reddenings in Table 2. The resulting standard system of
91 objects contains 52 stars from Table 2, average values
for 16 stars in common to the two systems, and 23 addi-
tional Cepheids from Turner et al. (1987). The system
of standard reddenings denoted here as “Std” refers to
the augmented system in the other comparisons made
in Fig. 2.

4

The reddening system of Kovtyukh et al. (2008) was
expected to fall very close to the space and KHG red-
dening scales because of the manner in which the color
excesses were derived relative to a stellar atmosphere
model-based eﬀective temperature scale. But diﬀerences
were noted previously for those reddenings with respect
to the empirical color-eﬀective temperature scale of Gray
(1992) by Turner et al. (2013a,b), possibly arising from
the surface gravity term included in the derivation of
colors from eﬀective temperatures by Kovtyukh et al.
(2008). A comparison of all overlapping reddenings in
Fig. 2 (middle) indicates a small zero-point oﬀset and
reddening-dependent term between the two scales, as
noted by the ﬁt in Table 3.

The Kovtyukh et al. (2008) color excesses are read-
ily tied to the system of space and KHG reddenings
using the relationship of Table 3, which was the pro-
cedure used here to augment the standard system of
reddenings. There is moderate scatter in the redden-
ing comparison, however, and it is not clear in which
system it originates. About a third of the reddenings
in the Kovtyukh et al. (2008) sample are tied to only
1 or 2 spectra, and that applies to the most deviant
data in Fig. 2 (middle). The remaining two thirds of
the sample is tied to Cepheids with anywhere from 3
to 26 spectra, so lack of spectroscopic sampling cannot
be the origin of the scatter. The adjusted reddenings
from Kovtyukh et al. (2008) were therefore assimilated
into the standard system with some care, particularly
for deviant Cepheids in the comparison sample.

The reddening system of Andrievsky et al. (2012) was
derived in analogous fashion to that of Kovtyukh et al.
(2008), so was expected to yield similar results, given
its stellar atmosphere model-based eﬀective temperature
scale. All stars in their compilation were analyzed pre-
viously for reddening by Kovtyukh et al. (2008). The
comparison in Fig. 2 (bottom) indicates both a zero-
point oﬀset and a larger reddening dependence for the
Andrievsky et al. (2012) reddenings. Presumably both
arise because the Andrievsky et al. (2012) reddening
system was calibrated using an intrinsic color rela-
tion tied to both Teﬀ and log g, as in Kovtyukh et al.
(2008), but normalized relative to the reddening scale
of Storm et al. (2011).
In order to agree with the
present reddening scale, it is necessary to apply a zero-
point oﬀset of +0.05 and a scaling factor of 0.89 to the
Andrievsky et al. (2012) color excesses, speciﬁcally by
the relationship given in Table 3. The scatter in the lat-
ter is slightly smaller than for the Kovtyukh et al. (2008)
reddenings, most likely because they are restricted to
Cepheids well-sampled spectroscopically.

The availability of two or more independent esti-
mates of reddening for each Cepheid formed the ratio-
nale for creating a more extensive standard system of
198 Cepheids by averaging the adjusted color excesses
of Andrievsky et al. (2012) with the space reddenings,
KHG reddenings, and adjusted Kovtyukh et al. (2008)

reddenings.

2.— A comparison of

Fig.
the adopted standard
color excesses (see text) with reddening compilations by
Turner et al. (1987, top), Kovtyukh et al. (2008, middle),
and Andrievsky et al. (2012, bottom). The y-axis values are
those of Table 1 supplemented by KHG reddenings in subse-
quent comparisons. Gray lines represent results expected for
coincident reddening scales, and black lines represent ﬁts to
the data.

The reddening system of the Storm et al. (2011)
study was established by applying the infrared surface-
brightness (IRSB) method to their Cepheid sample, with
the Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law used to adjust
the observed star brightnesses in diﬀerent wavelength
bands. A comparison of the derived reddenings from
that system with the standard system developed here
is depicted in Fig. 3 (top), and a regression ﬁt is tab-
ulated in Table 3. The zero-point for the Storm et al.
(2011) system agrees closely with the present standard
(Std) reddening system, but there is moderate scatter
and a reddening-dependent trend opposite to that for
the Andrievsky et al. (2012) system. The eﬀect may
be related to the manner of making extinction correc-
tions, given that the Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law
has recently been shown to conﬂict with actual extinc-
tion parameters in many Galactic ﬁelds (Zagury 2013;

6

Turner et al. 2014). Large scatter for some Cepheids can
be explained by the fact that they are southern hemi-
sphere objects for which only Kovtyukh et al. (2008)
reddenings are available for comparison, often Cepheids
sampled by Kovtyukh et al. (2008) with only a single
spectrum at one phase of the light curve.

An initial melding with the present system of the
Storm et al. (2011) reddenings, modiﬁed according to
the relationship in Table 3, created noticeable discrep-
ancies for three stars. Two in particular, WZ Car and
S Vul, have solid ﬁeld reddenings in Table 2, while
the reddening for VZ Pup diﬀered by ∼ 0m.2 from
the reddening derived by Kovtyukh et al. (2008).
Ini-
tially it was decided to include only the adjusted red-
denings of Storm et al. (2011) for the 57 least deviant
objects in the extended standard system, and subse-
quent analyses were carried out accordingly. It was later
noticed that the Kovtyukh et al. (2008) reddening for
VZ Pup created an anomalous intrinsic color for the
variable, whereas that from the adjusted Storm et al.
(2011) reddening did not. VZ Pup is a 23d Cepheid,
and the long-period pulsators, in particular, evolve the
fastest, display the most rapid rates of period change
(Turner et al. 2006a), and undergo the largest random
period ﬂuctuations (Turner et al. 2009c). Given that the
Kovtyukh et al. (2008) reddening for the star is tied to
only one spectrum, there is a possibility that the derived
light curve phase for that spectrum is erroneous, thereby
aﬀecting the reddening in systematic fashion. None
of the other Cepheid reddening comparisons involve
VZ Pup in signiﬁcant fashion, so the later decision to
exclude the transformed Kovtyukh et al. (2008) redden-
ing for the star in favor of the transformed Storm et al.
(2011) reddening does not impact the analyses.

The close agreement of the Table 2 reddenings with
results obtained using the KHG index (Turner et al.
1987), the reddening-independent parameter developed
at Brigham Young University for measuring the strength
of the stellar G band relative to the Ca II K line and
Hδ, raises the question of whether similar results ap-
ply to reddenings derived in other systems employing
a reddening-free parameter. The reddening system of
Williams (1966), for example, was calibrated using clus-
ter Cepheids and the break in the continuum across the
G band in Cepheid spectra, in similar fashion to the
method of establishing Teﬀ from KHG photometry. The
Str¨omgren system reddenings, Eb−y, of Williams (1966)
were converted to Johnson system reddenings, EB−V ,
using the 0.73 factor adopted by Turner et al. (1987),
and are compared with the present results in Fig. 3 (mid-
dle), as well as in Table 3. The scatter in the reddening
comparison is large, making the Williams (1966) color
excesses of little value for averaging into our standard
system. The scaling factor of 0.82 may relate to the
manner in which the system was calibrated using the
data inferred for cluster Cepheids in that era or how
reddening was treated in the Str¨omgren system.

systems are presented in Fig. 4, and summarized in Ta-
ble 3. All three systems are tied to Lick six-color (UVB-
GRI) photometry (Kron 1958; Stebbins & Kron 1964)
of Cepheids by Mianes (1963) and the sources cited by
Parsons (1971). Fig. 4 (top) compares the reddenings
of Mianes (1963) with the present standard system, the
former being converted from G–I reddenings to B–V red-
denings using the 1.89 conversion factor of Schneider
(1969). The Mianes (1963) reddenings appear to agree
overall with the color excesses of Table 2, but the scat-
ter for individual Cepheids is too large to make them
suitable for incorporation into the standard system.

Fig. 4 (middle) is a comparison with the redden-
ings of Parsons & Bouw (1971), derived by means of
model atmosphere and stellar evolutionary model ﬁts
to Lick six-color photometry of Cepheids. Fig. 4 (bot-
tom) presents similar results for the subsequent study by
Parsons & Bell (1975) using a similar methodology with
a Q parameter. So-called “reddening-free” Q parameters
depend directly on the reddening law adopted, which, as
noted in §2, is variable around the Galaxy. Reddenings
tied to Q parameters are therefore inherently unreliable,
and that applies here to the Parsons & Bell (1975) sys-
tem linked to Lick six-color photometry.

The reddenings of Parsons & Bell (1975) and Parsons & Bouw

(1971) have long been considered to be of high quality,
although there is a negative oﬀset of the former rela-
tive to the latter, presumably arising from the diﬀerent

Fig. 3.— A similar comparison to that of Fig. 2 for x-axis
color excesses from Storm et al. (2011, top), Williams (1966,
middle), and an average of the reddenings from Kraft (1960)
and Spencer Jones (1989, bottom), with y-axis values tied to
the extended 200-star standard system. Black and gray lines
are as in Fig. 2.

Γ-index reddenings (Kraft 1960; Spencer Jones 1989),
which are also tied to the strength of the G band in stel-
lar spectra, as measured photometrically, are presum-
ably reddening-free as well. They were calibrated in the
original studies using known reddenings for FG-type su-
pergiants and cluster Cepheids. A comparison of our
standard system reddenings with Γ-index color excesses
is depicted in Fig. 3 (bottom), where the Γ reddenings
from Kraft (1960) and Spencer Jones (1989) were aver-
aged in an attempt to reduce the rather sizeable scatter
in each. A regression ﬁt to the data is given in Table 3.
The Γ-index reddenings display large scatter no matter
how the data are combined. They were therefore omit-
ted from possible inclusion in an augmented standard
system.

The comparisons so far have been to systems that
should be independent of any period-color formulation.
That is not always the case for other published redden-
ing systems. Three comparisons with less well-deﬁned

methods of analysis. The generally small scatter in
Fig. 4 (middle) and the small uncertainties in the re-
gression ﬁt (Table 3) conﬁrm the relatively high quality
of the Parsons & Bouw (1971) reddenings, despite un-
certainties in how interstellar reddening was treated.
The Cepheids in the Parsons & Bouw (1971) sample
were therefore included in the standard system without
adjustment, although the residual scatter is of concern.
Similar statements do not apply to the Parsons & Bell
(1975) reddenings, which display slightly larger scatter
and a noticeable reddening-dependent trend.
It was
decided to omit them from inclusion in the standard
system.

Fig. 5 presents comparisons with the present standard
system for three reddening sources on the Str¨omgren sys-
tem, all derived from the observations of Feltz & McNamara
(1980): the original color excesses of Feltz & McNamara
(1980, top), those of Fernie (1987, middle), and those
of Gray (1991, bottom). As was the case for the red-
denings of Williams (1966), the Str¨omgren system red-
denings Eb−y were converted to Johnson system red-

denings EB−V using the factor of 0.73 adopted by
Turner et al. (1987). All three sources compared in
Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 3 appear to display
reddening-dependent oﬀsets that likely originate from
the adoption of reddening-free indices for Str¨omgren
photometry that are not strictly “reddening-free” ac-
cording to the arguments presented above. Despite that,
the scatter about the best-ﬁtting relations is generally
small, although that for the Gray (1991) reddenings
is suﬃciently tight to allow them to be amalgamated
into the present standard system after adjustment for a
zero-point oﬀset of +0.05 and a scaling factor of 0.85.
The actual adjustments were made using the Table 3
relationship.

Fig. 6 and Table 3 present comparisons with the
present system for three reddening sources tied to spec-
troscopic observations of Cepheids, either mixed spec-
troscopy/photometry as in the case of the color excesses
by Tsarevsky & Yakimova (1970, Fig. 6 (top)) or using
photometric systems designed to make use of gravity
and temperature-sensitive features in the spectra of yel-

Fig. 6.— A similar comparison to that of Figs. 2 & 3 for
color excess compilations by Tsarevsky & Yakimova (1970,

Lines are as in Fig. 2.

Fig. 7.— A similar comparison to that of Figs. 2 & 3 for

low and red supergiants: the Washington system used
by Harris (1981a,b, Fig. 6 (middle)), with conversion
from ET1−T2 to EB−V following Harris (1981a), and the
DDO system used by Dean (1981, Fig. 6 (bottom)). The
Cepheid reddening system of Harris (1981a,b) was cali-
brated using a period-color relation tied to cluster mem-
bers, so the large scatter in the resulting reddenings is
accounted for by the fact that Cepheids of identical pe-
riod lying in the instability strip can have appreciably
diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures, hence colors. The large
scatter for the reddenings of Tsarevsky & Yakimova
(1970) may be of similar origin, given that they are tied
to the spectroscopic inferences of Kraft, some of which
are linked to Γ-index reddenings (Kraft 1960), previously
indicated to exhibit large scatter (Fig. 3). The DDO sys-
tem reddenings of Dean (1981) are a remarkably close
ﬁt to the present system reddenings, however, and were
therefore amalgamated into the latter as cited.

Three more reddening sources are compared with the
present standard system in Fig. 7, with regression ﬁts
summarized in Table 3. Fig. 7 (top) shows a compari-

son with the reddenings of Pel (1978) on the Walraven
photometric system, converted to Johnson system red-
denings using the relationship adopted by Pel (1985).
Fig. 7 (middle) shows a comparison with the Geneva
system reddenings of Bersier (1996), while Fig. 7 (bot-
tom) is a comparison with the mixed-source reddenings
of Kiss & Szatm´ary (1998). The Walraven system red-
denings (Pel 1978) do not match the present standard
system, displaying large scatter as well as zero-point and
scaling oﬀsets. The reasons are unclear.

The Geneva system reddenings (Bersier 1996) are a
much better match to the present system, but with suf-
ﬁcient scatter to make the choice of amalgamation into
the standard set of this paper a diﬃcult decision. Six
Cepheids in particular do not ﬁt the general trend, and
again the reason is uncertain. Meanwhile, the ﬁnal com-
parison shown in Fig. 7 speaks to the unusual method
of calibration used by Kiss & Szatm´ary (1998) in their
study. The large scatter, as well as the zero-point oﬀset
and large scaling term, indicate a very poor match to the
present standard system. The color excesses inferred in

9

the Kiss & Szatm´ary (1998) study should not be used
for studies of the intrinsic properties of Cepheids.

Fig.
8.— A similar comparison to that of Figs. 2 & 3
for color excess compilations by Fernie (1967, top), Fernie
(1990a, photometric scale, middle), and Sasselov & Lester
(1990, bottom, plus signs) and Krockenberger et al. (1998,
bottom). Lines are as in Fig. 2.

Fig. 8 and Table 3 show comparisons with two large
compilations of Cepheid reddenings: an older but useful
study by Fernie (1967) presented in Fig. 8 (top), and
the oft-cited homogeneous collection of Fernie (1990a,
photometric scale) presented in Fig. 8 (middle). The
bottom portion of the plot is a comparison with the
reddenings of 5 Cepheids derived by Sasselov & Lester
(1990) and 11 Cepheids (including the previous 5) de-
rived by Krockenberger et al. (1998) using line ratios for
infrared spectroscopic lines such as C I and Si I to in-
fer eﬀective temperatures and, hence, intrinsic colors.
Both Fernie compilations went to some length to place
reddenings derived in various studies on a homogeneous
system, and both scales appear to be a reasonably good
match with the system of space reddenings for Cepheids
presented here. Reddening-dependent trends in the two
compilations appear to be negligible. But the scatter
is large in both cases, more so in the case of the older

10

study by Fernie (1967), so they cannot be adopted as
published for amalgamation with the present standard
system. Similar results apply to the cluster reddening
scale of Fernie (1990a).

The comparison with the results of Sasselov & Lester
(1990) and Krockenberger et al. (1998) in Fig. 8 (bot-
tom) is useful for indicating that the premise of us-
ing infrared spectroscopic line ratios for Cepheids to
infer redddenings is quite sound, as also demonstrated
by Kovtyukh et al. (2008) and Andrievsky et al. (2012).
The reddenings for four of the ﬁve Cepheids studied
by Sasselov & Lester (1990), plotted using plus signs,
agree closely with the present results. The ﬁfth Cepheid,
T Mon, is somewhat discrepant with respect to most
photometric reddening estimates for the star, but does
follow the trend for other stars with reddenings derived
in similar fashion (Krockenberger et al. 1998). The dis-
cussion by Sasselov & Lester (1990) notes the diﬀerence
with respect to the Fernie (1990a) reddening scale for
T Mon. The ﬁeld of this Cepheid is not well-studied
with regard to the reddening of nearby companions, so
it may be possible to resolve the minor discrepancy for
the star with additional observations of nearby compan-
ions to T Mon. Given the generally small scatter for
the reddenings, the color excesses of Sasselov & Lester
(1990) and Krockenberger et al. (1998) were included in
the standard system of this paper using the adjustments
cited in Table 3 for the Krockenberger et al. (1998) re-
sults.

Finally, Fig. 9 and Table 3 present comparisons with
reddening systems tied to near infrared photometry
of Cepheids. The study by Dean, Warren & Cousins
(1978) using Cape system BVI photometry generated
Cepheid reddenings that are well-matched to the stan-
dard system presented here, as indicated in Fig. 9 (top).
They were therefore amalgamated into the present stan-
dard system with only minor concerns about the small
discrepancies for some stars.

The study by Laney & Stobie (1993) focused mainly

on reddenings inferred from JHK observations of Cepheids,
and was tied to a sequence of published reddenings for
Galactic calibrators. The comparison is depicted in
Fig. 9 (middle). The most deviant data point corre-
sponds to the Cepheid S Vul, which did not have a
solid ﬁeld reddening in the era when the study was com-
pleted. Otherwise, the data display both a zero-point
oﬀset and a reddening dependence that conﬂict with the
present system of reddenings. Residual scatter in some
cases may be tied to other calibrators for which ﬁeld
reddenings were not well-established at the time of the
Laney & Stobie (1993) study.

The study by Laney & Caldwell (2007) was intended
to solidify the Cape system reddenings with reference to
Cepheid ﬁeld reddenings, and the generally small scatter
in the comparison displayed in Fig. 9 (bottom) implies
a very good match to the standard system established

of published reddening compilations for Cepheids. Ini-
tial testing was made relative to the KHG reddenings
of Turner et al. (1987), since the Brigham Young Uni-
versity KHG index is essentially reddening independent.
Similar comparisons with the spectroscopic reddenings
of Kovtyukh et al. (2008) and Andrievsky et al. (2012)
revealed small zero-point and reddening-dependent oﬀ-
sets relative to the system of space and KHG redden-
ings. Corrections for those, and use of the Turner et al.
(1987) reddenings as published, permitted the creation
of an expanded standard system comprising the best of
the available reddenings adjusted to the space reddening
and KHG reddening combination. The expanded stan-
dard system (Std) was used to make comparisons with
more extensive systems of published reddenings, with
the results presented in §3 and Figs. 2–9.

The comparative best of the other reddening systems
sampled, once adjusted for zero-point and scaling eﬀects,
are those of Kovtyukh et al. (2008), Andrievsky et al.
(2012), Storm et al. (2011), Parsons & Bouw (1971),
Gray (1991), Dean (1981), Sasselov & Lester (1990),
Krockenberger et al. (1998), Dean et al. (1978), and
Laney & Caldwell (2007). They are combined with the
space reddenings of Table 2 and the KHG reddenings of
Turner et al. (1987) into the standard system of redden-
ings summarized in Table 4, with the result for VZ Pup
modiﬁed as discussed earlier. A comparison of those
reddenings with the original system of space and KHG
reddenings is presented in Fig. 10. There is clearly some
residual scatter in the comparison, indicating the exis-
tence of uncertainties for some stars. Note, in particular,
the derived standard reddenings of EB−V = 0.32 and
0.37 for QZ Nor and V340 Nor, respectively, relative
to the common space reddenings of 0.39 adopted in §2.
It implies the necessity for additional work on problem
objects to resolve the small residual diﬀerences. The av-
erage standard deviation for the combined reddenings of
Cepheids with several independent estimates is ±0.028,
although for individual objects the values range from

here, except for a noticeable zero-point oﬀset. The re-
lationship of Table 3 found for the Laney & Caldwell
(2007) reddenings was therefore used to adjust them to
the present scale, in which they were subsequently in-
cluded.

Reddenings have been derived by Schechter et al.
(1992) for several Cepheids using JHK photometry, but
there is no overlap of their sample, all southern hemi-
sphere objects, with the present selection of calibrating
Cepheids. It is therefore not possible to test the manner
of deriving Cepheid reddenings from period-color rela-
tions using JHK colors, although presumably the smaller
scatter in intrinsic colors for Cepheids observed at far
infrared wavelengths should overcome most of the ob-
jections that would apply if the same methodology had
adopted optical band colors such as B–V.

SUMMARY

This study presents a collection of space reddenings
for 68 Cepheids, and uses the sample to test a variety

11

±0.002 to ±0.093. Readers should therefore use caution
when using the reddenings of Table 4 to deduce intrinsic
properties for speciﬁc Cepheids.

The periods used for the Cepheids in Table 4 are ei-
ther the observed periods, if considered to originate from
pulsation in the fundamental mode, or the observed or
inferred fundamental mode period P0 for double mode
pulsators or Cepheids, such as QZ Nor, SU Cas, and
V1334 Cyg, considered to be pulsating in the ﬁrst over-
tone mode with period P1. Decisions about pulsation
mode may be incorrect in some instances.

5. DISCUSSION

The original intent of the present study was to demon-
strate that it is possible to generate a system of Cepheid
color excesses that is solidly tied to the available sources
of space reddening for a signiﬁcant sample of stars, in-
cluding in the compilation color excesses derived from
reddening-free indices as a means of augmenting the new
standard system (Std). An earlier version of such a
compilation was described by Turner (2001), where it
was noted that some generalaties that could be inferred
from such a compilation regarding the Cepheid instabil-
ity strip diﬀered from those described by Fernie (1990b).
Similar conclusions can be made from the Cepheid sam-
ple of Table 4. Fig. 11, for example, is an empirical map-
ping of the colors of Cepheids as a function of pulsation
period, as derived from the color excess summary, and is
very similar to Fig. 2 of Turner (2001). Note, for exam-
ple, that the color width of the instability strip changes
very little as a function of pulsation period, contrary to
the conclusions of Fernie (1990b).

The methodology described by Turner & Burke
(2002) and Turner et al. (2010, see §1) can be used with
the Table 4 data to map the instability strip in terms of
eﬀective temperature and luminosity, as done by Turner
(2012b). Such results are not repeated here, although
it is noted that they support the general conclusions
made above. There is less scatter of Cepheids in the
instability strip than is sometimes believed, although
caution is needed when interpreting results for individ-
ual Cepheids. For example, the most deviant data in
Fig. 11 all relate to stars of special interest. A few are
likely Type II Cepheids, for example, and the two stars
of longest period are V810 Cen and HD 18391, respec-
tively. The former appears to be double-mode Cepheid-
like variable, the latter a small-amplitude double-mode
pulsator, both lying blueward of the Cepheid instability
strip.

A much smaller reddening is cited for HD 18391 by
Arellano Ferro & Parrao (1990), who tabulated, but did
not use, a value of EB−V = 0.56 by Schmidt (1984) for
the reddening of the double cluster h and χ Persei. That
value is clearly much too small according to the study of
HD 18391’s surroundings made by Turner et al. (2009a),
and would lead to an intrinsic B–V color for the super-

12

the pulsational period P0.

giant almost a half magnitude redder than expected for
a G0 Ia star lying oﬀ the blue edge of the instability
strip (see Turner et al. 2009a). Supergiants in the ﬁeld
around the double cluster also display strong evidence
for diﬀerential reddening, with EB−V ranging from 0.21
to 1.00, or larger, in this section of the Perseus spiral
arm. The reddening in the core regions of h and χ Persei
is therefore not representative of their outlying regions.
A useful extension of the present study would be
to include light amplitude as an additional parameter
with the Table 4 data plotted in Fig. 11. Light am-
plitude has previously been demonstrated to be related
to a Cepheid’s location in the instability strip, as in-
ferred from its rate of stellar evolution (see Turner et al.
2006a). An additional mapping of
light amplitude
within the strip using unreddened colors would help to
conﬁrm such ﬁndings. But that is left for a later in-
vestigation. The results of the present study are most
usefully summarized by the compilations of Tables 2 and
4.

As noted earlier, several investigations of Cepheid
ﬁeld reddenings through membership in open clusters
are as yet incomplete. It might also be possible to aug-
ment the sample of Cepheid reddenings by applying the
transformation relations of Table 3 to other Cepheids in
the cited studies that are not coincident with the main
sample of this paper. A larger sample of semi-empirical
reddenings for classical Cepheids is therefore within rel-
atively easy reach.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The present study owes much to the eﬀorts of many diﬀerent re-
search collaborators over the author’s lifetime, for which he is eternally
grateful. The referee, Armando Arellano Ferro, also did much to in-
spire a thorough reworking of the original results to place them on
sounder footing and make them more useful to a broader community.
The study is much better for that input.
