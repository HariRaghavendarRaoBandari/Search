We study the details and time dependence of particle production in nuclear collisions at a ﬁxed
target beam energy of Elab = 1.76 A GeV with the UrQMD transport model. We ﬁnd that the
previously proposed production mechanism for multi strange hadrons, φ and Ξ, are possible due to
secondary interactions of incoming nuclei of the projectile and target with already created nuclear
resonances, while the Fermi momenta of the nuclei play only a minor role. We also show how the
centrality dependence of these particle multiplicities can be used to conﬁrm the proposed mechanism,
as it strongly depends on the number of participants in the reaction. Furthermore we investigate
the time dependence of particle production in collisions of Ca+Ca at this beam energy, in order to
understand the origins of the apparent chemical equilibration of the measured particle yields. We
ﬁnd that indeed the light hadron yields appear to be in equilibrium already from the very early
stage of the collision while in fact no local equilibration, through multi collision processes, takes
place. The apparent equilibrium is reached only through the decay of the resonances according to
available phase space.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of hadron production in nuclear collisions,
at beam energies of a few GeV per nucleon, has the po-
tential to give insights not only on the properties of hot
and dense hadronic matter [1–3], but also on the fun-
damental mechanisms which govern particle production
in these collisions. In particular strange particles, which
are produced below their elementary production thresh-
old have proven to show interesting properties. Here one
tries to understand the large production probability for
multi strange hadrons, the φ and the Ξ−, as measured by
experiments at the SIS18 accelerator [4–8]. Furthermore
the fact that most light hadron multiplicities in A+A and
p+A collisions, at these energies, can be well approxi-
mated by a canonical ensemble in chemical equilibrium
[9, 10] is yet to be understood microscopically.

In previous works we have shown that the production
of light and strange hadrons in collisions at low beam
energies, at the SIS18, can be consistently described by
the UrQMD transport model where we introduced known
cross sections on the strangeness exchange reactions [11].
We found that the production of the φ meson and Ξ
baryon can also consistently described by the intermedi-
ate excitation of a heavy resonance, where the branching
ratios were constrained by elementary reactions like p+p
and p+A [12]. The resulting φ and Ξ− yields in collisions
of heavier nuclei were consistent with experimental data
which indicated that the yields of heavy baryons, con-
taining more than on strange (or anti-strange) quark, are
good measures for the non-equilibrium nature of particle
production at this low beam energies. Even though the
successful description of the data was achieved, several
questions remained and new ones arose.
In this paper
we will address these questions which can be outlined as
follows:

1. As the strange particle production occurs as a sub
threshold process at the beam energies considered,
it is quite relevant which processes lead to the accu-
mulation of suﬃcient energy to produce the heavy
hadrons. In particular we want to distinguish the
eﬀects of the Fermi momenta, present in the incom-
ing nuclei, from secondary interactions of produced
hadrons, which can accumulate energy.

2. In the previous paper we have already discussed
an additional observable which can be used as in-
dependent conﬁrmation of the processes proposed,
i.e. the nuclear transparency of the φ meson. In
this work we introduce another observable which
may be used to conﬁrm our approach. The central-
ity and system size dependence of the Ξ−/Λ and
φ/π.

3. Recently the idea that the hadron yields, mea-
sured in low energy collisions at the SIS18, can be
described by a thermal ﬁt has been put forward
[9, 10]. Indeed if only the light and single strange
stable hadrons are considered one obtains a satis-
factory ﬁt. Since the particle yields are also well
described with the UrQMD transport model one
would expect that the model can also produce a
system in apparent chemical equilibrium, with the
known exception of the Ξ baryon. It is now inter-
esting to investigate if these apparent equilibrium
yields are the result of a long equilibration pro-
cess in the transport model, following from many
multi step processes, or whether hadrons are essen-
tially born into apparent equilibrium after a few
steps. We have to note that, because we are dealing
with deep sub-threshold processes for strangeness
production, single collisions cannot lead to the ob-
served yields of strange hadrons.

FIG. 1.
[Color online] Shown (as blue short dashed line) is the distribution of the maximally available invariant mass for
resonance creation from initial scatterings of target and projectile nucleons. Note that the peak of the distribution corresponds
to the energy available in proton+proton collisions, at the same beam energy, while the Fermi momenta in the nucleus smear
out the distribution. The black dashed line shows the actual invariant mass distribution of N* resonances from these initial
nucleon+nucleon scatterings, which is shifted because the outgoing particles have ﬁnite momenta. The red solid line depicts
the invariant mass distribution of all N* resonances which decay during the systems whole evolution. Sub-ﬁgure (a) presents
results of very peripheral collisions of Ca+Ca at Elab = 1.76 A GeV, while sub-ﬁgure (b) depicts results for head on collisions.
In sub-ﬁgure (c) we show results for central Be+Be collisions at the same beam energy.

In the following we will answer these questions. The
paper is organized such that we ﬁrst introduce the model
used, UrQMD. Then we will investigate the role of Fermi
momenta and secondary interactions in the sub threshold
production of strange hadrons.
In the last part of the
paper we will discuss the origin and time dependence of
the apparent chemical equilibrium in the model.

II. THE MODEL

For the following we will employ the newest version
of the UrQMD transport model [13, 14]. The UrQMD
model
is based on the propagation and scattering of
hadrons and hadronic resonances. All the hadron prop-
erties, i.e.
their masses, quantum numbers, widths as
well as scattering cross sections are, where known, taken
from the particle data book [15]. In recent publications
we have presented new features that were implemented
and which turned out to be essential for the descrip-
tion of strange particle production below their elemen-
tary energy threshold [11, 12]. These processes are the
strangeness exchange reactions Y +π ↔ N +K as well as
new decay channels for the most massive baryonic reso-
nances included in UrQMD. As we have found in previous
publications, the inclusion of such processes allows for a
good description of heavy ion collision data at the SIS18
energy regime. In addition, our approach has been shown

to describe the absorption cross section of the φ meson
in a cold nuclear environment.

It is important to note that in the current version the
model does not include any additional medium eﬀects
which would change the hadron properties in nuclear col-
lisions and we have not included any hadronic potentials.
We believe that is of great importance to ﬁrst establish
a benchmark of particle production before one should
discuss possible eﬀects of hadronic long range and multi
particle interactions. Such eﬀects have been discussed
in particular in the context of kaon+nucleon interactions
which have been found to inﬂuence the resulting kaon
and anti-kaon spectra in nuclear collisions [3, 16–39]. In
order to quantify the strength of the hadronic interac-
tions one needs to establish a baseline from elementary
reactions, and its systematic uncertainties. A dedicated
study concerning the kaon spectra at SIS18 energies, in
the UrQMD model, is underway and will be discussed in
the future. In the present paper however, we will focus
on the eﬀects and changes on measured particle yields
which occur due to multiple scatterings in nuclear colli-
sions, as compared to elementary collisions. Thus we will
discuss eﬀects like secondary scatterings as well as Fermi
momenta on particle production.

[Color online] Distribution of the decay times of N∗
resonances (green short dashed line). We also show the distri-
butions of resonances with masses larger than MN∗. Appar-
ently high mass resonances decay at a later time (roughly by
1 fm/c) than lighter resonances, as they have to be created
in secondary collisions an therefore appear at a later stage of
the collision.

III. RESULTS

First we investigate the production mechanisms of the
most heavy N* resonances, in order to interpret our pre-
vious results on φ and Ξ production. As we have dis-
cussed before there are two mechanisms in nuclear col-
lisions, in contrast to elementary p+p collisions, to pro-
duce particles with larger mass than the available invari-
ant energy in the p+p collision. One of these mechanisms
stems from the fact that nucleons inside a nucleus obtain
Fermi momenta and therefore individual collisions of tar-
get and projectile participants may have a larger invari-
ant mass than given by the beam energy. We can deﬁne
the maximally available invariant energy, for production
of a N* in such a collision of nucleons of the projectile
and target nucleus, as the total invariant energy minus
the second nucleon mass.

The distribution of this totally available energy, in sev-
eral diﬀerent colliding systems, at the same beam energy
of Elab = 1.76 A GeV is shown in ﬁgures 1 as blue short
dashed lines. The peak of this distribution obviously is
located at the beam energy (in the CM frame of the col-
lision) minus the nucleon mass. However we also observe
a signiﬁcant smear of the distribution which can origi-
nate only from the Fermi momenta of the nucleons, as we
consider only collisions of target and projectile nucleons
which have not yet scattered. As the vertical grey lines
indicate the energy required to produce a N*, with suﬃ-
cient mass to subsequently create a φ or Ξ, one can clearly
observe, that the Fermi momenta alone are not suﬃcient
to lift the energy above their required production thresh-
old. This becomes even more clear as we also depict the
actual invariant mass distribution if N* resonances from

3

such initial scatterings of the incoming nucleons (as black
dashed line). The distribution is shifted to lower masses
by almost 200 MeV. This shift can be explained from the
fact, that the resonances produced in the original scat-
terings do not obtain the maximally available mass, but
acquire a ﬁnite momentum which then lowers the mass of
the nucleus. Furthermore the production probability is
in fact a result of the single N* production cross section
which serves as input in the UrQMD model, hence we
also observe a certain structure in the mass distribution.
If we now compare this primary production to the mass
distribution from all decaying N* resonances (during the
whole time evolution of the system), we observe that this
distribution is signiﬁcantly changed. The late time re-
generation of resonances introduces a signiﬁcant peak at
the low mass end of the distribution, as well as signif-
icantly enhances the high mass tail which is responsi-
ble for φ and Ξ production.
It is therefore clear that
the heavy resonances which then may decay into heavy
multi strange particles are created in secondary interac-
tions where primarily produced resonant states serve as
an energy reservoir.
It is interesting to note that this
accumulation of energy through subsequent inelastic col-
lisions has the same net eﬀect as the introduction of multi
particle (mean ﬁeld) potentials, where the available and
necessary energy to produce a heavy hadron is shared
and accumulated by the interacting system of hadrons.

The idea that secondary interactions serve to accumu-
late energy for the production of heavy hadronic states is
supported by an observation regarding the decay times
of N* resonances, as depicted in ﬁgure 2. Usually one ex-
pects that heavier resonances have smaller lifetime, but
as is shown in the ﬁgure we observe that heavier N* res-
onances appear to decay, on average, at a later time than
the lighter states. The only reason for this can be that
they are actually created at a later time, as they have
to go through at least 2 or more collisions to accumulate
enough mass. Only at the very late stage of the collision,
for t > 10 fm/c, we observe again an increased decay of
lighter resonances, which are essentially from late stage
regeneration of light resonances from meson + baryon
interactions.

Since we established that the production of the heavy
resonance states originates from secondary interactions
with incoming target and projectile nucleons, we can as-
sume that there should be a strong dependence of the
availability of such states on the abundance of participat-
ing nucleons in the reactions. In other words we expect
a strong dependence of the multi strange particle yields
on collision centrality and/or system size. We therefore
investigated the dependence of several strange particle
ratios as a function of centrality, determined by the im-
pact parameter b, in the UrQMD model, for collisions of
Ca+Ca at a beam energy of Elab = 1.76A GeV. The re-
sults are depicted in ﬁgure 3. As expected the ratios of
multi strange hadrons show a much stronger centrality
dependence as the single strange. Even the Ξ−/Λ ratio
has a very strong centrality dependence which may serve

FIG. 3.
[Color online] Centrality dependence of several
strange particle ratios for collisions of Ca+Ca at a ﬁxed tar-
get beam energy of Elab = 1.76A GeV, as simulated with
UrQMD. A strong centrality dependence for the Ξ− and φ are
observed as they can only be created in secondary reactions.
We compare the results from Ca+Ca with central collisions
(b=0 fm) of the smaller system Be+Be (dashed lines). The
ratios in the Be+Be collision system are consistent with pe-
ripheral Ca+Ca collisions, indicating a universal Npart scaling
as expected for multiple step processes.

as a signal for the Ξ− production through secondary re-
actions of incoming nuclei. We have also simulated very
central head on collisions of Be+Be at the same beam en-
ergy. The resulting ratios are shown as dashed horizontal
lines in ﬁgure 3. For both, the Ξ−/π+ and φ/π+ ratio
from the Be+Be collision correspond to a Ca+Ca colli-
sion at a centrality which has the same number of partic-
ipants as a b = 0 Be+Be collision. Again this points to a
very strong dependence of multi strange hadron produc-
tion on the number of participants and therefore on the
number of possible secondary interaction partners.

Recently the centrality dependence of sub threshold φ
production has been published by the FOPI collabora-
tion. In ﬁgure 4 we compare our UrQMD results on φ
production in collisions of Ni+Ni nuclei at a ﬁxed target
beam energy of Elab = 1.93 A GeV with the data pre-
sented in [41]. The model agrees well with the data and
shows a strong centrality dependence of the φ/π+ ratio,
due to the increasing number of secondary interactions
in more central collisions. We understand this result as
another validation of our approach.

A. Apparent Equilibration

An interesting ﬁnding from experiments at SIS18 was
that the particle abundances of stable hadrons appear
to be well described by a ﬁt to an equilibrated chemical
ensemble of hadrons. Only few exceptions, for example
the production yields of Ξ baryons and some resonance

results well describe the measured centrality dependence.

yields, from this ﬁnding were observed. Here the ques-
tion arises why a system, which consists essentially of
hadrons, can equilibrate in the short time scales that
are involved in such collisions. On the other hand we
have found that the hadronic transport model UrQMD
does give a reasonable description of all observed particle
ratios and therefore can also be described as producing
hadrons in apparent equilibrium. The advantage of the
dynamical microscopic model is however, that we can in
detail investigate the particle production and ﬁnd out
at which point during the interaction the equilibration
(if it indeed occurs at all) takes place and how long the
systems remains in such a state.

To do so we ﬁrst extracted the time dependence of sta-
ble particle yields from a sample of UrQMD simulations
of Ca+Ca collisions at a beam energy of Elab = 1.76
A GeV. The results for the diﬀerent particle species are
shown in ﬁgure 5, where all yields are normalized to their
ﬁnal (at a time T=100 fm/c) value. We observe that dif-
ferent particles approach their ﬁnal value at a diﬀerent
rate. For example the Ξ− approaches it’s asymptotic
value quickly, while the pions and especially negatively
charged Kaons only slowly appear in the collision zone.
The reason for this behavior is simple to understand. The
negatively charged kaons come, to a relevant degree from
the decay of long lived φ mesons and the pions are usu-
ally bound inside resonances for a long time, thus their
late appearance.

Here we have to point out that the time dependence
we have observed so far is not useful if we want to study
the approach of the particle yields to equilibrium. Usu-
ally one considers stable particle yields after resonance
decays. Therefore we show again the time dependence
of the stable particle yields for the aforementioned col-
lisions, but this time forcing all resonances to decay at

stable particles in central (b<4 fm) collisions of Ca+Ca at a

as they are usually ’hidden’ in resonances.

the particular time of output. The results are shown in
ﬁgure 6. Now the picture has changed considerably. If
we force all resonances to decay at the point of output,
the number of pion appears to be rising quickly and even
overshoots the ﬁnal value. This can be understood as a
result of the pions usually being ’hidden’ in resonances
during the most of the evolution. At the late stage these
resonances can also be absorbed and therefore the pion
yields starts to decrease. It is noteworthy that the max-
imum of the pion number coincides with the point of
maximal compression, i.e. the point in time of the largest
central density. This point marks the end of the interpen-
etration phase during which the energy of the incoming
target and projectile nucleons is deposited in the system.
All other particle numbers increase as a function of the
collision time. After considering the immediate decays,
the Ξ− yield even grows the slowest which supports the
idea that it actually is not produced in the ﬁrst binary
scatterings, but in secondary collisions.

It is now interesting to quantify the degree of equili-
bration that appears to be reached by these secondary
reactions. In particular we would like to know how many
inelastic collisions are require to bring the system to a
state which appears to be very close to chemical equi-
librium. In ﬁgure 7 we present the time evolution of the
average number of inelastic collisions, which has occurred
until the time t, scaled with the number of participants
at that time. As expected the number of inelastic colli-
sions increases with time. The rate at which it increases
is nearly constant until shortly after the interpenetra-
tion time, after which it slowly saturates. It is expected,
that during the interpenetration of the nuclei, the most
inelastic collisions occur. It is however surprising, that
the total number of collisions per nucleons remains small

ber extracted refers to particles after resonance decays. Even
if instant resonance decays are taken into account, the num-
ber of ﬁnal stable particles increases diﬀerently for diﬀerent
particle species. The pion number in actually overshoots the
ﬁnal value and saturates later, while the Ξ− number increases
slower as it is produced in secondary interactions.

only 1-2 inelastic collisions per participant nucleon have

was argued that already 3 collisions per participant may
be suﬃcient to achieve thermal equilibrium.

In order to quantify how well the system produced
resembles a hadron gas in chemical equilibrium we have
made a ﬁt of the calculated multiplicities presented in
ﬁgure 6 to the statistical hadronization model (SHM).
To cross-check the ﬁts, we have employed two well
known and tested codes: the THERMUS package [42]
and the code used in the analysis [43].

[Color online] Results of two SHM ﬁts to the time
dependent stable particle yields obtained with UrQMD sim-
ulations of central (b<4 fm) collisions of Ca+Ca at a ﬁxed
target beam energy of Elab = 1.76A GeV. The SHM ﬁts
were performed with the THERMUS package (solid lines) and
the Florence code (dashed lines). We show the temperature
(green squares) and baryo chemical potential (red circles) as
function of time. The thermal parameters already saturate
around 10 fm/c. We compare the ﬁt results with the thermal
parameters obtained from a coarse graining approach (black
lines, see text).

The SHM and its applications to heavy ion collisions
has been described in detail elsewhere [44–53]. The ba-
sic assumption is that hadronization occurs in a state of
chemical equilibrium at some common value of the local
temperature and chemical potentials. Hence, the pri-
mary hadronic multiplicities are completely determined
by few thermodynamical parameters. For large enough
volumes, the multiplicities can be calculated with the
grand-canonical ensemble according to the formula:

bosons. Once the primary yields are obtained with (1),
the feed-down contribution is calculated by using the ex-
perimentally measured branching ratios.

At SIS energies, however, the grand-canonical formula
is not a good approximation for the calculation of yields.
Particularly the strange particles are so few that the ef-
fect of exact conservation of strangeness (the so-called
canonical suppression) cannot be neglected. The for-
mula (1) has to be modiﬁed to take this eﬀect into ac-
count and the statistical ensemble to be used is the so-
called strangeness-canonical ensemble [52]. In the limit

energy of Elab = 1.76A GeV. The SHM ﬁts were performed
with the THERMUS package (solid lines) and the Florence
code (dashed lines). We show in ﬁgure (a) the ratio of the
strangeness canonical radius over the system radius (black
squares) and the γs parameter (black circles). Both quan-
tities have a similar systematic behavior and can be seen as
equivalent. Most interestingly, we show in ﬁgure (b) the qual-
ity of the ﬁt as function of time. Except for the very early
times, where no good ﬁt could be obtained, the ﬁt quality is
always satisfactory.

of Boltzmann statistics, which is an excellent approxi-
mation for all strange particles, this results in a multi-
plicative factor which approaches, in the limit of large
volumes and temperatures, the grand canonical fugacity
exp[−µSSj].

Furthermore, it is known that particles with strange
valence quarks are not at full chemical equilibrium, that
is they deviate from the prediction of (1). The undersat-
uration of strangeness phase space is implemented diﬀer-
ently in the aforementioned codes: in the code of ref. [43],
an ad hoc strangeness suppression factor γS powered to
the number of valence strange quarks, multiplying the ex-
ponentials in (1) is introduced; instead, in THERMUS,
vanishing strangeness is enforced within a reduced vol-
ume (strangeness correlation volume), enhancing the ef-
fect of canonical suppression. It should be pointed out
that these two methods of extra suppression lead to dif-
ferent predictions of the hidden strangeness particle pro-
duction,
like the φ [9, 10], which are not aﬀected by
strangeness canonical suppression.

The results of the ﬁts can be seen in ﬁgure 8 as solid
(THERMUS) and dashed (Florence) lines. The Ξ− hy-
peron was excluded from the ﬁt and the errors used in the
χ2 were basically the same as in the experimental mea-
surements. Here we show the extracted temperature and
baryon chemical potential as function of time. Both SHM
approaches give similar results on the extracted thermal
parameters. As found in the ﬁts to experimental data,

the only eﬀect of an inclusion of the Ξ− in the ﬁt data
set is a dramatic increase of the minimum χ2 whereas the
best-ﬁt parameters are almost unaﬀected. The obtained
thermodynamical parameters show a clear time depen-
dence. They increase during the early stage of the col-
lision, reaching their maximum roughly around the time
of interpenetration, and then decrease slowly, reaching
their ﬁnal value at a time of about 13 fm/c.

Instead of using a statistical model analysis one can
apply another method to extract the temperature and
chemical potential, of the produced ﬁreball, during its
evolution. Such a method, the coarse graining, has been
ﬁrst applied in [54] to the system and beam energy un-
der investigation.
In the coarse graining approach one
uses a large sample of UrQMD events to calculate the
average local energy-momentum tensor. One then makes
the assumption of local thermal equilibrium to extract
energy and baryon number densities in the center of the
collision region. These can then be translated to the ex-
tensive quantities, temperature and chemical potential,
by the use of a hadronic equation of state (for details see
[54]). The values of the temperature and chemical po-
tential that were found in the coarse graining approach
are depicted as black solid lines in ﬁgure 8. There is
an astonishing agreement of these values with the ones
found by our thermal model analysis.
In the time be-
tween 5 and 13 fm/c both approaches give essentially
the same results. Only at later time, when the chemi-
cal abundances freeze out we start to observe expected
diﬀerences. This coincidence is very surprising and non-
trivial, as both approaches are very diﬀerent and it is
interesting that they give similar results. One would ex-
pect such a coincidence if indeed the system was in local
equilibrium, which we already found to be unlikely due
to the few scatterings that occur during the evolution.
For completeness we refer the reader to a slightly diﬀer-
ent approach of extracting the thermal parameters from
UrQMD with very similar results, presented in [55].

The parameters which represent the under saturation
of strangeness in the collisions, namely the strangeness
canonical radius RC and strangeness suppression factor
γS are shown in ﬁgure 9 as function of time. Here again
both ﬁts are essentially compatible and the canonical ra-
dius and strangeness suppression show the systems sys-
tematic and quantitative trend. Consequently the only
diﬀerence in using either parameter is their eﬀect on hid-
den strangeness hadrons, such as the φ meson which are
suppressed by γS but not by RC .

In the bottom part of ﬁgure 9 we compare the ﬁt qual-
ity, as represented by the χ2 per degree of freedom, for
the two thermal models. Both show an astonishingly
good ﬁt quality for times larger than 5 fm/c, in fact bet-
ter than the ones observed for experimental data. Only
in the very ﬁrst time step, a time when only very few
inelastic collisions have occurred, a bad ﬁt quality is ob-
served. Again it appears unlikely that such a good ﬁt
quality could be the result of many scatterings leading
to an equilibration process, but is the result of only very

7

few (1-2) resonance excitations and their decays.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented results on strange particle produc-
tion in the UrQMD transport model at SIS18 energy nu-
clear collisions. To summarize the most important ﬁnd-
ings of this work:

• We have found that the Fermi momenta of the nu-
cleons in the nuclei are not suﬃcient to lift the
threshold constraint on the production of massive
multi strange particles like the φ and Ξ−, in colli-
sions of Ar+KCl at Elab = 1.76 A GeV. The pro-
duction yield of these hadrons is therefore very sen-
sitive to multi step production processes and in par-
ticular the excitation of heavy baryonic resonances
through secondary interactions. We have proposed
that such a process leads to a very strong central-
ity dependence of the φ/π and Ξ/Λ ratios. This is
conﬁrmed by the FOPI data.

• We have calculated the time dependence of sta-
ble hadron yields, assuming immediate decays, and
used these as an input for a SHM analysis. We
found that the hadron yields can be well described
by an hadronic gas in chemical equilibrium during
most of the systems bulk evolution. At very early
times t ≤ 5 fm/c only few initial binary collisions
have occurred and a signiﬁcant fraction of these pri-
mary reactions are elastic N+N scattering. Conse-
quently the resulting particle yields cannot be well
described within the thermal model ( i.e. yielding a
bad ﬁt quality). Once however secondary reactions
are taking place, leading to the excitation of numer-
ous baryonic resonances, the corresponding parti-
cle yields can be well described with the thermal
model, i.e. they resemble yields of a hadronic sys-
tem in chemical equilibrium. This apparent equi-
librium persists until a time of t ≥ 13 fm/c after
which the inelastic collisions cease and the hadronic
yields are frozen. It appears that only very few in-
elastic collisions are required to create a systems
which appears to be in chemical equilibrium, which
explains why for example the pion spectra appear
thermal, even after a very short time, as found in
[55]. This may also explain why light particle yields
in nuclear and even elementary collisions can be
well described by a statistical model ﬁt. On the
other hand it shows that the production rate of
rare and very heavy hadrons is very sensitive to
the non-equilibrium tails of the mass distribution of
the resonances created in these secondary collisions,
therefore serving as signals for the non-equilibrium
nature of particle production.

• We found that the values of the extensive quan-
tities T and µB obtained with the SHM ﬁt agree

remarkably well with the values found with a coarse
graining approach. Both methods of deﬁning T
and µB are not necessarily related.
It is impor-
tant to note that the apparent state of equilibrium
is reached already after very few (1-2) inelastic col-
lisions, essentially after the excitation and decay of
one or two resonances. The masses of these reso-
nances have been found to be smeared mainly by
the Fermi momenta present in the nuclei as well
as few secondary interactions. After the isotropic
decay of the resonance, which are according to mea-
sured branching ratios, the resulting system resem-
bles a hadronic gas near local equilibrium. The
microscopic processes which lead to this equilibra-
tion are not, as sometimes assumed many consec-

8

utive hadronic scatterings, but rather follow from
the excitation and decay of a small number of heavy
states, in accordance with available phase space.
