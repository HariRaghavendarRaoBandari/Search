THE UNREASONABLE WEAKNESS OF R-PROCESS COSMIC RAYS IN THE NEUTRON-STAR-MERGER

NUCLEOSYNTHESIS SCENARIO

Koutarou Kyutoku1 and Kunihito Ioka2

Draft version March 3, 2016

ABSTRACT

We reach a robust conclusion that, by combining the observed cosmic rays of r -process elements
with the fact that the velocity of the neutron-star-merger ejecta is much higher than that of the
supernova ejecta, either (i) the reverse shock in the neutron-star-merger ejecta is a very ineﬃcient
accelerator that converts only less than 0.003% of the ejecta kinetic energy to the cosmic-ray energy,
or (ii) the neutron star merger is not the origin of the Galactic r -process elements.
Subject headings: cosmic rays — nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances — acceleration of

particles — shock waves — stars: neutron — ISM: supernova remnants

INTRODUCTION

Where are the r -process elements—neutron-rich heavy
elements such as the gold, platinum, and rare earth
elements—formed in our universe? This is a longstand-
ing problem in nuclear astrophysics (see Qian & Wasser-
burg 2007; Arnould et al. 2007, for reviews). The r -
process nucleosynthesis requires an extremely neutron-
rich environment, because the neutrons have to be cap-
tured by seed nuclei more rapidly than the β-decay pro-
ceeds. Thus, it is widely believed that the r -process nu-
cleosynthesis is intimately related to explosive events in-
volving neutron stars.

The universality of the observed r -process abundance
pattern in metal-poor stars suggests that only a sin-
gle type of astronomical events should be responsi-
ble for the nucleosynthesis (Sneden et al. 2008). One
possible site is the core-collapse supernova (Burbidge
et al. 1957), but theoretical investigations are gather-
ing evidence against the successful r -process nucleosyn-
thesis in this scenario (Qian & Woosley 1996). An-
other possible site is the merger of binary neutron stars
and/or black hole-neutron star binaries, which we collec-
tively call neutron star mergers (Lattimer & Schramm
1974; Symbalisty & Schramm 1982). The neutron-star-
merger scenario seems to be supported by successful r -
process nucleosyntheses in nuclear network calculations
(Freiburghaus et al. 1999; Wanajo et al. 2014), con-
sistency of the theoretically-estimated production rate
with the observed abundance (Korobkin et al. 2012),
possible detections of the macronova/kilonova following
short-hard gamma-ray bursts (Tanvir et al. 2013; Berger
et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2015), reproduction of metal-
poor r -process-enriched stars in Galactic chemical evo-
lution models (Hirai et al. 2015), and indication to a
“low-rate/high-yield” event by the deep-sea plutonium
measurement (Hotokezaka et al. 2015).

In this paper, we revisit an old idea that the com-
position measurement of cosmic rays could serve as a
tool to explore the origin of elements (see, e.g., Arnett &

Schramm 1973), aiming at critically assessing the plau-
sibility of the neutron-star-merger scenario for the r -
process nucleosynthesis. Because the longterm evolution
of the neutron-star-merger ejecta should resemble that
of the supernova ejecta, i.e., supernova remnants (Nakar
& Piran 2011), cosmic rays should be accelerated at the
shock associated with the blast-wave interaction between
the ejecta and interstellar medium (Kyutoku et al. 2013;
Takami et al. 2014a). If the ejecta from any event contain
r -process elements, they could be accelerated when the
reverse shock sweeps into the ejecta, and the amount of
accelerated r -process elements (hereafter r -process cos-
mic rays) should depend on the ejecta properties such
as the mass and velocity. This suggests that the ﬂux
of r -process cosmic rays could enable us to distinguish
the nucleosynthesis sites, namely the supernova or the
neutron star merger.

Our ﬁnding is summarized as follows.

First, the
ﬂux of r -process cosmic rays around the energy of
1 GeV nucleon−1 could be enhanced by a few orders of
magnitude compared to the ﬂux expected from the su-
pernova forward shock with the solar composition,
if
the r -process elements are synthesized in the neutron
star merger. By contrast, the r -process cosmic-ray ﬂux
should not be signiﬁcantly enhanced if the supernova is
the nucleosynthesis site. The reason of this diﬀerence
is the high velocity of the neutron-star-merger ejecta,
which can increase the total energy of the r -process cos-
mic rays for a given mass of r -process elements. Second,
the observed cosmic rays do not show selective enhance-
ment of r -process elements and are known to be consis-
tent with the solar abundance at the acceleration sites
(Meyer et al. 1997; Ellison et al. 1997). The weak ﬂux of
r -process cosmic rays indicates that either (i) the particle
acceleration is very ineﬃcient at the reverse shock in the
r -process-dominated neutron-star-merger ejecta, or (ii)
the neutron star merger does not contribute to Galactic
r -process elements signiﬁcantly.

IMPORTANT QUANTITIES

Before starting the discussion of r -process cosmic rays,
we list important quantities used in later estimation. The
relative mass fraction of r -process elements in the solar

2

neighborhood is estimated to be (Qian 2000)

Xr ∼ 10−7.

on the r -process cosmic rays will impose a tighter con-
straint on the acceleration eﬃciency at the reverse shock,
CR,r ≡ ηr/f CR, in the neutron-star-merger scenario.

(1)

This implies that the amount of r -process elements in our
Galaxy is Mr ∼ 104M(cid:12) and that the Galactic r -process
˙Mr ∼ 10−6M(cid:12) yr−1. This
element production rate is
quantity will play a key role in our estimation to alleviate
uncertainties associated with the event rate, ejecta mass,
and r -process yield per event.

The amount of r -process elements synthesized in a sin-
gle event under a hypothetical production scenario is es-
˙Mr,
timated by dividing the Galactic production rate,
by the event rate. On one hand, the Galactic supernova
rate is estimated to be RSN ∼ 3 × 10−2 yr−1 (see, e.g.,
Qian 2000). Thus, the single-event yield of r -process ele-
ments should be Mr,SN = ˙Mr/RSN ∼ 3 × 10−5M(cid:12) if the
supernova is the production site. This value should be
compared with the typical mass of the supernova ejecta,
Mej,SN ∼ 3M(cid:12) (see, e.g., Truelove & Mckee 1999), and
therefore the fraction of r -process elements is

Xr,SN ∼ 10−5.

(2)

On the other hand, the Galactic neutron-star-merger rate
is estimated to be RNSM ∼ 10−4 yr−1 with a large uncer-
tainty (Abadie et al. 2010). This gives us an estimate of
the single-event yield as Mr,NSM = ˙Mr/RNSM ∼ 0.01M(cid:12)
for the neutron-star-merger scenario. Assuming that all
the ejecta material is synthesized to r -process elements
(Freiburghaus et al. 1999; Wanajo et al. 2014), i.e.,

Xr,NSM ∼ 1,

(3)

this value is consistent with the typical ejecta mass
Mej,NSM ∼ 0.01M(cid:12) obtained by general-relativistic
hydrodynamical simulations (Hotokezaka et al. 2013a;
Bauswein et al. 2013) and is also roughly suﬃcient to
power a possible macronova/kilonova associated with
GRB 130603B (Berger et al. 2013; Tanvir et al. 2013;
Hotokezaka et al. 2013b) (but see also Kisaka et al. 2015).
It is widely accepted that Galactic cosmic rays are ac-
celerated from the inter/circumstellar material at the for-
ward shock of blast waves associated with the supernova
ejecta. This scenario requires a fraction

CR ∼ 0.1

of the ejecta kinetic energy to be converted to the cosmic-
ray energy. We use the ﬁducial value, CR ∼ 0.1, for both
the supernova and neutron-star-merger forward shocks in
this study.

The most uncertain quantity is the fraction of the en-
ergy given to cosmic rays at the reverse shock to that at
the forward shock, ηr/f . This fraction is crucial for the
total energy of the r -process cosmic rays, because they
are expected to be accelerated not only at the forward
shock but also at the reverse shock sweeping into the
ejecta. We take a provisional value of this fraction to be

ηr/f ∼ 0.01

for both the supernova and neutron-star-merger ejecta,
because this is an upper limit derived by the condition
that the reverse-shock acceleration do not dominate the
forward-shock acceleration for the elements synthesized
in the supernova (see the next section). The discussion

3. R-PROCESS COSMIC RAYS

We focus on the ﬂux at the lowest energy range for
r -process cosmic rays, ∼ 1 GeV nucleon−1. In this range,
the ﬂux is determined primarily by the total energy or
injection rate of r -process cosmic rays irrespective of the
spectral index, the prediction of which requires the pre-
cise knowledge of acceleration, escape, and propagation.
The Galactic conﬁnement time does not aﬀect compar-
isons among diﬀerent acceleration sites, because it should
be determined solely by the rigidity. Although the com-
position changes moderately during the Galactic propa-
gation, this again does not aﬀect the comparisons.

First, we estimate the energy injection rate of r -process
cosmic rays out of the inter/circumstellar material at the
forward shock associated with the supernova ejecta. Tak-
ing the typical kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta to
be Eej,SN ∼ 1051 erg (see, e.g., Truelove & Mckee 1999),
the energy injection rate of cosmic rays is estimated to be
˙ECR = CREej,SNRSN ∼ 3 × 1048 erg yr−1. This amount
roughly matches the total generation rate of Galactic
cosmic rays estimated from the observation.
If we as-
sume that the cosmic-ray composition ratio is propor-
tional to the elemental abundance, the energy injection
rate is given by

˙Er,ISM = Xr ˙ECR ∼ 3 × 1041 erg yr−1.

(6)

We consider the enhancement of refractory and/or large-
mass-number elements (Meyer et al. 1997; Ellison et al.
1997) separately in the next section. The contribution
from the forward shock associated with the neutron-star-
merger ejecta is negligible due to the low event rate.

Next, we estimate the energy injection rate of r -
process cosmic rays for the supernova nucleosynthesis
scenario. The energy injection rate of all the acceler-
˙ECR ∼
ated particles at the reverse shock is given by ηr/f
3 × 1046 erg yr−1(ηr/f /0.01). Taking Xr,SN ∼ 10−5, we
obtain

˙Er,SN = Xr,SNηr/f

(7)

again assuming that the cosmic-ray composition is given
by the relative mass fraction. Thus, if the supernova is
the r -process nucleosynthesis site, we do not expect sig-
niﬁcant enhancement of r -process cosmic rays compared
˙Er,ISM, as
to those from the inter/circumstellar material,
far as ηr/f (cid:46) 0.01.

Finally, we estimate the energy injection rate of r -
process cosmic rays for the neutron-star-merger nucle-
osynthesis scenario. We take the ejecta kinetic en-
ergy to be a typical value derived by general-relativistic
simulations of binary neutron star mergers, Eej,NSM ∼
3 × 1050 erg (Hotokezaka et al. 2013a; Bauswein et al.
2013), which corresponds to the ejecta velocity vej,NSM ∼
0.2c with c the speed of light. Using this value, the en-

ergy injection rate of r -process cosmic rays is given by

˙Er,NSM = Xr,NSMηr/f CREej,NSMRNSM

for our ﬁducial CR ∼ 0.1.
To summarize, we obtain the ratios

(9)

This suggests that the ﬂux of r -process cosmic rays
at ∼ 1 GeV nucleon−1 could be enhanced by a few or-
ders of magnitude compared to the expectation from the
supernova forward shock with the solar composition if
the r -process nucleosynthesis occurs in the neutron star
merger, while the enhancement is not expected in the
supernova scenario. Note that the relation ˙EX,SN ∼
(ηr/f /0.01) ˙EX,ISM also holds for any supernova nucle-
osynthesis product X, so that the upper limit on the ac-
celeration eﬃciency from the supernova nucleosynthesis
is ηr/f (cid:46) 0.01. Otherwise, the cosmic-ray composition
below the iron could have changed substantially from the
solar composition (beyond the spallation modiﬁcation).
The enormous enhancement for the neutron-star-
merger scenario, despite the same total r -process yields
as the supernova scenario, is ascribed to the high ejecta
velocity. To put it simply, the energy injection rate of
r -process cosmic rays at the reverse shock is given by

ej,∗/2,

˙Er,∗ = ηr/f CR ˙Mrv2

(10)
where ∗ stands for either SN or NSM, and thus the energy
injection rate at the reverse shock is proportional to the
ej,∗, which is larger by ∼ 100 for
squared ejecta velocity v2
the neutron star merger than for the supernova. This ra-
tio is completely free from uncertainties associated with
Xr,∗, Mej,∗, and R∗. The value of v2
ej,NSM may span a
range of 0.01–0.1c2 (Hotokezaka et al. 2013a; Bauswein
et al. 2013), and therefore its uncertainty may be much
smaller than those of the event rate and ejecta mass.

4. WEAKNESS THEREOF

The observations of heavy cosmic rays can be explained
solely by the forward shock of supernova blast waves
without invoking any contribution from the reverse shock
(Binns et al. 1989; Westphal et al. 1998; Donnelly et al.
2012). They ﬁnd (i) similar enhancement by a factor
of 20–30 for iron-group and refractory r/s-process cos-
mic rays, and (ii) enhancement by a factor of 3–10 for
volatile r/s-process cosmic rays.
It is also found that
the enhancement ratio may be correlated with the mass
number of elements (Rauch et al. 2009). It has to be cau-
tioned that the measured elements are only classiﬁed by
the charge, and the isotope ratios are not accurately mea-
sured. This precludes the clear distinction between r -
process and s-process elements. However, no systematic
diﬀerence in enhancement is found between r -process-
dominant elements such as the platinum and s-process-
dominant elements such as the cerium (see, e.g., Table. 1
of Sneden et al. 2008, for the breakdown), and thus the
enhancement is likely to be similar for both elements.
The strong enhancement of the refractory elements is

inter/circumstellar medium with the solar composition as a func-
tion of the acceleration eﬃciency at the reverse shock, CR,r =
ηr/f CR. The diagonal red lines show the enhancement ratio in
the neutron-star-merger scenario for the r -process nucleosynthesis,
˙Er,NSM/ ˙Er,ISM. The solid line is for our ﬁducial ejecta velocity,
vej,NSM = 0.2c. The upper and lower dotted lines are for 0.3c and
0.1c, respectively, and are drawn to indicate the uncertainty esti-
mate. The diagonal black dotted line at the right bottom is for
˙Er,SN/ ˙Er,ISM. The hor-
the supernova nucleosynthesis scenario,
˙Er,∗/ ˙Er,ISM (cid:46) 3, derived by
izontal blue line is the upper limit,
the observation of heavy cosmic rays (Meyer et al. 1997; Ellison
et al. 1997). Only the region below this line is allowed, and thus
the acceleration eﬃciency higher than CR,r ∼ 0.003% at the re-
verse shock is unlikely in the neutron-star-merger nucleosynthesis
scenario. The vertical dotted line is the upper limit, CR,r = 0.1%,
obtained from the condition that the lighter-than-iron cosmic rays
are not dominated by the supernova reverse-shock component.

explained by eﬃcient acceleration via suprathermal in-
jection from dust grains (Meyer et al. 1997; Ellison et al.
1997; Rauch et al. 2009). Furthermore, the enhancement
of s-process cosmic rays is explained by neither the super-
nova nor neutron-star-merger ejecta, because the ejecta
are hardly expected to be enriched by s-process elements.
The observations do not support Eq. (9) with ηr/f ∼
0.01, i.e., the selective r -process enhancement in heavy
cosmic rays. This indicates the weakness of r -process
cosmic rays from the neutron star merger. The contribu-
tion from the neutron-star-merger ejecta to the enhance-
˙Er,NSM (cid:46)
ment should be less than a factor of 3, i.e.,
3 ˙Er,ISM, otherwise it contradicts with the observations
of refractory elements such as the zirconium relative to
the iron and with the observations of volatile elements
such as the krypton (Meyer et al. 1997; Ellison et al.
1997).

The weakness or even absence of enhanced r -process
cosmic rays places a constraint on particle acceleration
at the reverse shock of blast waves associated with the
neutron-star-merger ejecta. Figure 1 shows the allowed
acceleration eﬃciency of r -process cosmic rays at the re-
verse shock in the neutron-star-merger nucleosynthesis
scenario. This ﬁgure indicates that, if the neutron-star-
merger scenario is true, the reverse shock associated with
the r -process-dominated ejecta has to be an ineﬃcient
accelerator with

CR,r = ηr/f CR (cid:46) 0.003%.

(11)
This constraint is more severe by a factor of ∼ 100/3 ∼
30 than that obtained from the supernova. The reasons
for the ineﬃciency of the reverse-shock acceleration in the
neutron star merger may include weak magnetic ﬁelds

in the ejecta, absence of r -process dust grains, and/or
energy loss to the adiabatic expansion. The absence of
r -process dust grains in the neutron-star-merger ejecta
is consistent with the ﬁnding of Takami et al. (2014b),
although this eﬀect is not suﬃcient to fully account the
weakness. Conversely, if the reverse shock turns out to
be a moderately eﬃcient accelerator for the neutron-star-
merger ejecta, our result implies that the neutron star
merger contributes very little or not at all to the Galactic
r -process enrichment.

5. FUTURE PROSPECT

Precise measurement of the cosmic-ray composition is
useful to narrow down the uncertainty range.
In par-
ticular, a detailed investigation of the diﬀerence between
r -process and s-process cosmic-ray ﬂuxes is highly appre-
ciated, because the contribution from any ejecta is likely
to be much larger in the r -process enhancement than
in the s-process enhancement. Moreover, uncertainties
should be reduced if we compare elements with similar
mass numbers and similar volatility. For this purpose, it
is important to measure the isotope ratio of heavy cos-
mic rays to precisely separate r -process and s-process
elements. We also have to understand nuclear interac-
tions like spallation during the cosmic-ray propagation
to precisely recover the composition at the acceleration
site from the observed one.

The velocity of the neutron-star-merger ejecta also re-
quires an investigation. While it is safely expected that
the ejecta velocity is higher for the neutron star merger
than for the supernova, the precise value depends on
the mass ejection mechanism. For example, the veloc-
ity is likely to become low if the late-time activity such
as disk winds contributes substantially to the mass ejec-
tion (Fern´andez & Metzger 2013; Just et al. 2015; Kiuchi
et al. 2015). The velocity could be determined by observ-
ing synchrotron emission around the Sedov time (Nakar
& Piran 2011; Takami et al. 2014a).

It is very diﬃcult to pin down the acceleration eﬃ-
ciency at the reverse shock accurately, while this is one
of the last pieces to assess the plausibility of the neutron-
star-merger scenario for the r -process nucleosynthesis by
studying cosmic rays. We could in principle infer the
eﬃciency by observing reverse-shock emission, such as
gamma-rays from hadronic interaction (see, e.g., Helder
& Vink 2008, for leptonic emission from Cas A). How-
ever, the large distance of ∼ 100 Mpc expected for a
yearly neutron-star-merger event prohibits us from tak-
ing this approach in the real life (Abadie et al. 2010).

Theoretical investigations of the reverse-shock acceler-
ation are highly desired, particularly for the r -process-
dominated ejecta. Relevant topics include magnetic-ﬁeld
ampliﬁcation from the value typical of neutron stars, in-
jection of r -process elements involving possible dust for-
mation, and energy loss to the adiabatic expansion before
the escape. If eﬃcient acceleration at the reverse shock
would be a likely outcome, the unreasonable weakness of
r -process cosmic rays challenges the neutron-star-merger
nucleosynthesis scenario.
