Introduction

In this paper, let us consider the problem

( ∆pu + ∆p(|u|2γ)|u|2γ−2u = a(x)g(u)

u > 0 in RN , u(x)

|x|→∞
−→ ∞,

on RN ,

(1.1)

where ∆pu = div(|∇u|p−2∇u) with 1 < p < ∞ is called the p−Laplacian operator, a(x), x ∈ RN is
a nonnegative continuous function, g(s), s ≥ 0 is a nondecreasing continuous function that satisﬁes
g(0) = 0, γ > 1/2, and N ≥ 1.

In the case p = 2, the equation (1.1) is referred in the literature as a modiﬁed nonlinear
Scho¨odinger equation because it contains a quasilinear and nonconvex term ∆(|u|2γ)|u|2γ−2u. This
In
quasilinear term is called of non-square diﬀusion for γ 6= 1 and square diﬀusion for γ = 1.

particular when γ = 1, the solution of (1.1) is related to standing wave solutions for the quasilinear
Schr¨odinger equation

izt + ∆z − ω(x)z + κ∆(h(|z|2))h′(|z|2)z + η(x, z) = 0, x ∈ RN ,

(1.2)

where ω is a potential given , h and η are real functions and κ is a real constant. This connecting
is established by the fact that z(t, x) = e−iβtu(x) is a solution to the equation (1.2), if u satisﬁes
the equation in (1.1), for suitable ω, h and η.

The quasilinear Schr¨odinger equation (1.2) is an important model that comes from of several
mathematical and physical phenomena, for example, if h(s) = s it models a superﬂuid ﬁlm in
plasma physics [9], while for h(s) = (1 + s)1/2, the equation (1.2) models the self-channeling of
a high-power ultrashort laser in matter [8] and [16].
In addition, it also appears in the theory
of Heidelberg ferromagnetism and magnus [6],[13]; in dissipative quantum mechanics [1]; and in
condensed matter theory [4].

On the other side, it is well-known that the blow-up condition appears in the study of population
dynamics, subsonic motion of a gas, non-Newtonian ﬂuids, non-Newtonian ﬁltration as well as in the
theory of the electric potential in a glowing hollow metal body. The research of this subject passed
by a great development with the works of Keller [7] and Osserman [15] in 1957 that established
necessary and suﬃcient conditions for existence of solutions for the semilinear and autonomous
problem (that is, p = 2 and a ≡ 1)

( ∆pu = a(x)g(u) in RN ,

u ≥ 0 in RN , u(x)

|x|→∞
−→ ∞,

(1.3)

where g is a non-decreasing continuous function. Keller established that

= ∞, where G(t) =Z t

0

g(s)ds, t > 0

(G) :

Z +∞

ppG(t)

is a suﬃcient and necessary condition for the problem (1.3) to have solution. In this same year,
Osserman proved the same result for sub solutions of (1.3). After these works, when (G) is not
satisﬁed, the function g has become well-known as a Keller − Osserman function.

After this, a number of researchers have worked in related problems. These researches have
showed that the existence of solutions for (1.3) is very sensible to the “how radial” is a(x) at
inﬁnity, that is, how big is the number

aosc(r) := a(r) − a(r), r ≥ 0,

where

a(r) = min{a(x) / |x| = r} and a(r) = max{a(x) / |x| = r}, r ≥ 0.

(1.4)

Note that aosc(r) = 0, r ≥ r0 if, and only if, a is symmetric radially in |x| ≥ r0, for some r0 ≥ 0.

That is, if r0 = 0 we say that a is radially symmetric.

In this direction, for p = 2 and a radially symmetric, Lair and Wood in [11] considered g(u) = uγ,

u ≥ 0 with 0 < γ ≤ 1 (that is, g does not satisﬁes (G)) and showed that

Z ∞

1

ra(r)dr = ∞.

(1.5)

is a suﬃcient condition for (1.3) has a radial solution.

2

Still with p = 2, in 2003, Lair [10] enlarged the class of potentials a(x) by permitting aosc to

assume values not identically null, but not too big ones. More exactly, he assumed

Z ∞

0

raosc(r)exp(A(r))dr < ∞, where A(r) =Z r

0

sa(s)ds, r ≥ 0

and proved that (1.3), with suitable f that includes uγ for 0 < γ ≤ 1, admits a solution if, and
only if, (1.5) holds with a in the place of a. Keeping us in this context, we also quote Rhouma and
Drissi [3] for 2 ≤ p ≤ N , and references therein.

Coming back to problem (1.1), we note that issues about existence and multiplicity of solutions
for equations related to the equation in (1.1) (since positive, negative to nodal solutions) have been
treated by a number of researchers recently, but there is no accurate results for existence of solutions
to (1.1), that is, with the blow up behavior for the solutions. See for instance [12, 20, 5, 2, 18, 19, 22]
and references therein.

Before stating ours principal results, we set that a solution of (1.1) is a positive function u ∈

C 1(RN ) that satisﬁes u → ∞ as |x| → ∞ and

and consider the assumption on g

(g) :

holds.

We point out that this hypothesis is so natural, because when γ = 1/2 (that is, the problem

(1.1) reduces to (1.3)), it reduces to a standard condition for (1.3)). Our ﬁrst result is.

Theorem 1.1 Assume that g satisﬁes (g) and (G). If a(x) is such that aosc ≡ 0 and

(1.6)

holds, then there exists a positive constant A such that Aa = (A, ∞), where

Aa = {α > A / (1.1) admits a radial solution with u(0) = α}.

For non-radial potentials a(x), motivated by recent works, we assume that G : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞)

deﬁned by

G(t) =

g(t)−1/(p−1), t > 0,

Theorem 1.2 Assume p ≥ 2, g satisﬁes (g), (G) and g(t)/tδ, t > 0 is non-decreasing for some
δ ≥ 2γ − 1. Suppose also that a(x) is such that a satisﬁes (1.6) and a satisﬁes (G). Then there
exists a solution u ∈ C 1(RN ) of the problem (1.1) satisfying α ≤ u(0) ≤ (α + ε) + H, for each
α > A, ε > 0 given.

We organized this paper in the following way.

In the section 2, we establish an equivalent
problem to the (1.1), via an very speciﬁc changing variable, and in the last section we completed
the proof of theorems 1.1 and 1.2.

2 Auxiliar results

We begin this section proving a result that permits us to transform (1.1) into a new problem with
an structure in what is clearest to see how the Keller − Osserman condition works. As noted
before, this condition is fundamental to show existence of solutions that blow-up at inﬁnity. This
approach of changing the (1.1) for another one was introduced by [12] (for γ = 1 and p = 2) and
followed by a number of authors to study related equations to (1.2).

To do this, motivated by [5] with p = 2 and [17] with γ = 1, we are going to consider f given

by the solution of the equation

f ′(t) =

1

[1 + (2γ)p−1|f (t)|p(2γ−1)]1/p

, t ∈ (0, ∞); f (t) = −f (−t), t ∈ (−∞, 0],

(1.7)

and we are able to prove the next Lemma.

Lemma 2.1 Assume p > 1 and γ > 1/2 hold. Then f satisﬁes:

(f )1 f ∈ C 1 is uniquely deﬁned and invertible,

(f )2 0 < f ′(t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ R,

(f )3 |f (t)| ≤ |t| for all t ∈ R,

(f )4 f (t)/t → 1 when t → 0,

(f )5 |f (t)|2γ ≤ (2γ)1/p|t| for all t ∈ R,

(f )6 f (t)/2 ≤ γtf ′(t) ≤ γf (t) for all t ≥ 0,

(f )7 |f (t)|/|t|1/2γ → A > 0 when |t| → ∞, where A is a constant,

(f )8 there exists a positive constant C so that |t| ≤ C[|f (t)| + |f (t)|2γ] for all t ∈ R,

(f )9 |f (t)|(2γ−1)f ′(t) ≤ 1/2(p−1)/p for all t ∈ R,

(f )10 f ′(t)f (t)δ is non-decreasing for all t ≥ 0 and δ ≥ 2γ − 1.

Proof of (f )1 : Considering the problem

(cid:26) y′ = [1 + (2γ)p−1|y|p(2γ−1)]−1/p,

y(0) = 0,

t > 0,

(1.8)

4

it follows from Theorem of existence and uniqueness for initial value problem in ordinary diﬀerential
equations that the problem (1.8) has an unique solution, namely, y = f (t). Besides this, f ′(t) > 0
for all t ∈ R implies that f is invertible.
P roof of (f )2 : It follows from above that f ′(t) = [1 + (2γ)p−1|f (t)|p(2γ−1)]−1/p ∈ (0, 1], t ∈ [0, ∞).
Now, for t ≤ 0, it follows from the deﬁnition of f that f ′(t) = f ′(−t) = [1 + (2γ)p−1|f (−t)|p(2γ−1)]−1/p ∈
(0, 1], as well.
P roof of (f )3 : This follows from (f )2, f (0) = 0, and f ′(t) ≤ 1 for all t ≥ 0, together with the fact
of f being a odd function.
P roof of (f )4 : Since,

f (t) =Z t

for some η ∈ (0, t), we obtain from this information, that

[1 + (2γ)p−1|f (η)|p(2γ−1)]1/p

P roof of (f )5 : Since, f ′(t)[1 + (2γ)p−1|f (t)|p(2γ−1)]1/p = 1, for all t ∈ R, it follows by integration
that

f ′(s)[1 + (2γ)p−1|f (s)|p(2γ−1)]

p ds = t, for t > 0.

So, doing the change variable z = f (s), we obtain

,

that is, f (t)2γ ≤ (2γ)1/pt, for all t ≥ 0. Since, f is an odd function, it follows the claim (f )5.
P roof of (f )6 : Let us deﬁne F1(t) := 2γt − f (t)[1 + (2γ)p−1f (t)p(2γ−1)]1/p, t ≥ 0 and note that
F1(0) = 0 and

1(t) = (2γ − 1) − (2γ − 1)(2γ)p−1f (t)p(2γ−1)[1 + (2γ)p−1f (t)p(2γ−1)]

So, it follows from (f )2 that F ′

1(t) > 0, t > 0, that is, the ﬁrst inequality follows from the non-

In a similar way, deﬁning F2(t) := t − f (t)[1 + (2γ)p−1f (t)p(2γ−1)]1/p, t ≥ 0 and noting that

F2(0) = 0 and

F ′

1−p

p f ′(t) < 0, t > 0,

it follows our second inequality.
P roof of (f )7 : Since,

f ′(t)t1/2γ − 1

2γtt1/2γ

,

5

it follows from (f )6, that f (t)/t1/2γ , t > 0 is increasing. So, by using (f )5, we obtain our claim.
P roof of (f )8 : It follows from (f )4, (f )7, and the fact of f being odd, that

|f (t)| ≥(cid:26) C|t|,

C|t|1/2γ,

|t| ≤ 1,
|t| ≥ 1,

for some real positive constant C. That is, |t| ≤ C[|f (t)| + |f (t)|2γ] for all t ∈ R.
P roof of (f )9 : This is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of f .
P roof of (f )10 : It follows from deﬁnition, that

f ′′(t) = −(2γ)p−1(2γ − 1)f (t)p(2γ−1)−1[1 + (2γ)|f (t)|p(2γ−1)]−2/p−1 t ≥ 0,

that is,

(f ′(t)f (t)δ)′ = [1 + (2γ)|f (t)|p(2γ−1)]−2/pf (t)δ−1 δ + (2γ)p−1(δ + 1 − 2γ)f (t)p(2γ−1)

1 + (2γ)p−1|f (t)|p(2γ−1)

> 0, t > 0,

because δ ≥ 2γ − 1, by hypothesis. These end our proof.

Below, we are going to apply the the function f determined by (1.7) to reduce (1.1) to another

one. So, we have.

Lemma 2.2 Assume u = f (w) (or w = f −1(u)). Then u is a solution of (1.1) if, and only if w is
a solution of the problem

( ∆pw = a(x)g(f (w))f ′(w)

w ≥ 0 in RN , w(x)

in RN ,

|x|→∞
−→ ∞.

(1.9)

Proof First, note that it follows from Lemma 2.1-(f )1 that u ∈ C 1(RN ) if, and only if, w ∈ C 1(RN )
and u ≥ 0 if, and only if, w ≥ 0. Besides this, it follows from Lemma 2.1-(f )5 and (f )8 that
w(x) → ∞ as |x| → ∞ if, and only if, u(x) → ∞ as |x| → ∞. To complete the proof, since

∇u = f ′(w)∇w =

[1 + (2γ)p−1|f (w)|p(2γ−1)]

∇w =

we get to

that is,

for all ϕ ∈ C 1

On the other side, since

[1 + (2γ)p−1|u|p(2γ−1)]1/p∇ϕ = ∇{[1 + (2γ)p−1|u|p(2γ−1)]1/pϕ} − ∇[1 + (2γ)p−1|u|p(2γ−1)]1/pϕ,

3 Proof of Theorems

In the sequel, we are going to apply the last two Lemmas, together with some ideas found in [14],
to complete our proof.
Proof of T heorem 1.1. Since a(x) = a(|x|), x ∈ RN , we have that (1.9) is equivalent to the problem

(cid:26) (rN −1|w′|p−2w′)′ = rN −1a(r)g(f (w))f ′(w)

w′(0) = 0, w(0) = α ≥ 0,

in (0, ∞),

(1.10)

where r = |x| ≥ 0 and α ≥ 0 is a real number. Now, since a, g and f ′ are continuous functions, it
follows from an approach in [21] that there exists a Γ(α) > 0 (maximal extreme to the right for the
existence interval of solutions for (1.10), and a wα ∈ C 2(0, Γ(α)) ∩ C 1([0, Γ(α))) solution of (1.10)
on (0, Γ(α)), for each α > 0 given.

If we assumed that Γ(α) < ∞ for some α > 0, we obtain by standard arguments on ordinary
diﬀerential equations that wα(r) → ∞ as r → Γ(α)−, that is, wα(|x|) would satisﬁes to the problem

( (rN −1|w′|p−2w′)′ = rN −1a(r)g(f (w))f ′(w)

w(0) = α > 0, w′(0) = 0, wα(x)

r→Γ(α)−

−→ ∞.

in (0, ∞),

Moreover, it follows from Lemma 2.1-(f )2, that w satisﬁes

( (rN −1|w′|p−2w′)′ ≤ a∞rN −1g(f (w))

w(0) = α > 0, w′(0) = 0, wα(x)

r→Γ(α)−

−→ ∞,

in (0, ∞),

(1.11)

where a∞ = max ¯BΓ(α)

a(x).

Since u′ ≥ 0, we can rewrite the inequality in (1.11) as

(cid:16)(w′)p−1(cid:17)′

≤ a∞(g ◦ f )(w), for all 0 < r < Γ(α)

and multiplying by w′ and integrating on (0, r), we obtain

p − 1

p (cid:16)w′(r)(cid:17)p

a∞(g ◦ f )(w(s))w′(s)ds = a∞Z w(r)

w′(r) ≤(cid:16)a∞

p

p − 1(cid:17)1/p

, for all 0 < r < Γ(α).

Now, by integrating in the last inequality over (0, Γ(α)) and reminding that wα(x)→∞ as

r → Γ(α)−, we obtain

w(0)(cid:16)Z t
Z ∞

0

(g ◦ f )(s)ds(cid:17)−1/p

dt ≤(cid:16)a∞

p

p − 1(cid:17)1/p

Γ(α) < ∞.

(1.12)

On the other side, it follows from Lemma 2.1-(f )3, and monotonicity of g, that (g ◦ f )(t)) ≤ g(t)

for all t ≥ 0. That is,

Z t

0

(g ◦ f )(s)ds ≤Z t

0

g(s)ds = G(t), t ≥ 0.

As a consequence of this, we have

Z ∞

w(0)

G(t)−1/pdt ≤Z ∞

w(0)(cid:16)Z t

0

(g ◦ f )(s)ds(cid:17)−1/p

dt.

So, it follows from (1.12), that

G(t)−1/pdt < ∞,

Z ∞

1

but this is impossible, because we are assuming that g satisﬁes the hypothesis (G).

To complete the proof, it follows from (f )3, (f )7 and of deﬁnition of f , that there exist real

constants A1, A2 > 0 such that

f (t) ≥ A1t1/2γ and f ′(t) ≥ A2t1−2γ for all t > A,

for some A > 0. So, as a consequence of these, we have

g(f (wα(r)))f ′(wα(r)) ≥ A2g(f (wα))w1−2γ

and for each α > A given, because wα(r) ≥ α, for all r ≥ 0.

Since, wα satisﬁes

This end the proof.

Proof of T heorem 1.2. Given β > α > A, where A > 0 was given above, it follows from Theorem
1.1 that there exist positive and radial solutions wα and wβ to the problems

( ∆pwα = a(|x|)g(f (wα))f ′(wα) in RN ,

wα(0) = α, wα(x)

respectively, where a and a were deﬁned in (1.4).

Besides this, it follows from wα and g be nondecreasing, (1.6) and Lemma 2.1-(f )3, that

0 < S(β) = sup{r > 0 / wα(r) < wβ(r)} ≤ ∞,

we claim that S(β) = ∞ for all β > α + H, for each α > A given. In fact, by assuming this is
not true, then there exists a β0 > α + H such that wα(S(β0)) = wβ(S(β0)). So, by using that g is
non-decreasing, Lemma 2.1-(f )10 and wα ≤ wβ on [0, S(β0)], we obtain that

On the other hands, it follows from g, f , and wα being nondecreasing, that

where χ[0,S(β)] stands for the characteristic function of [0, S(β)].

So, it follows from the hypothesis (G) and (1.13), that

β0 ≤ α +Z ∞

H(s)ds ≤ α + H,

but this is impossible.

Now, by setting β = (α + ǫ) + H, for each α > A, ǫ > 0 given, and considering the problem

(cid:26) ∆pw = a(x)g(f (w))f ′(w) in Bn(0),

w ≥ 0 in Bn(0), w = wα on ∂Bn(0),

(1.14)

we can infer by standard methods of sub and super solutions that there exists a wn = wn,α ∈ C 1(Bn)
solution of (1.14) satisfying A < α ≤ wα ≤ wn ≤ wβ in Bn for all n ∈ N. So, by compactness, there
exists a w ∈ C 1(RN ) such that w(x) = limn→∞ wn(x) is a solution of (1.1).
