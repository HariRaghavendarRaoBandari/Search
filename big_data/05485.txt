Abstract

The Galactic bulge, that is the prominent out-of-plane over-density present in the inner few kiloparsecs of
the Galaxy, is a complex structure, as the morphology, kinematics, chemistry and ages of its stars indicate.
To understand the nature of its main components – those at [Fe/H](cid:38) −1 dex – it is necessary to make an
inventory of the stellar populations of the Galactic disc(s), and of their borders : the chemistry of the disc
at the solar vicinity, well known from detailed studies of stars over many years, is not representative of the
whole disc. This ﬁnding, together with the recent revisions of the mass and sizes of the thin and thick discs,
constitutes a major step in understanding the bulge complexity. N-body models of a boxy/peanut-shaped
bulge formed from a thin disc through the intermediary of a bar have been successful in interpreting a
number of global properties of the Galactic bulge, but they fail in reproducing the detailed chemo-kinematic
relations satisﬁed by its components and their morphology. It is only by adding the thick disc to the picture
that we can understand the nature of the Galactic bulge.

1 THE GALACTIC BULGE

The bar-like shape and boxy/peanut structure of the
Galactic bulge, found also in a large number of external
galaxies (L¨utticke et al. 2000; Kormendy & Kennicutt
2004), have been known for long time (Okuda et al.
1977; Maihara et al. 1978; Weiland et al. 1994; Dwek
et al. 1995; Binney et al. 1997; Babusiaux & Gilmore
2005; L´opez-Corredoira et al. 2005; Rattenbury et al.
2007; Cao et al. 2013). This structure constitutes
the innermost thick part of a longer and ﬂatter bar,
extending up to about 4–5 kpc from the Galaxy centre
(Benjamin et al. 2005; Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007;
Wegg et al. 2015). Its orientation is between 20 and 30
degrees with respect to the Sun-Galaxy centre direction
(Bissantz & Gerhard 2002; Shen et al. 2010; Wegg
& Gerhard 2013), and at vertical distances from the
plane of about 400 pc, a prominent X-shape becomes
visible in the data (McWilliam & Zoccali 2010; Nataf
et al. 2010; Wegg & Gerhard 2013; Gonzalez et al.
2015a), indicative of a stellar bar evolving secularly
after buckling (Combes & Sanders 1981; Athanassoula
2005; Debattista et al. 2006; Martinez-Valpuesta et al.
2006; Ness et al. 2012; Di Matteo et al. 2014).
Studies of the bulge kinematics also support its bar-like
nature and thus ultimately its link to the disc. The
bulge shows indeed cylindrical rotation (Howard et al.
2008, 2009; Kunder et al. 2012), as predicted by N-body

models where the bulge is formed via the buckling of
a pre-existing thin stellar bar formed in a cold stellar
disc (Shen et al. 2010; Saha et al. 2012; Ness et al.
2013b; Di Matteo et al. 2015). The vertex deviation
observed in the stellar velocities (Zhao et al. 1994; Soto
et al. 2007; Babusiaux et al. 2010), especially for its
metal-rich population (Babusiaux et al. 2010), is also
an indication of its asymmetric structure.

Bulge stars span a large range in [Fe/H] and [α/Fe]
(with -3 dex ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0.6 dex and 0 dex ≤
values
[α/Fe] ≤ 0.4 dex, see Rich 1988; McWilliam & Rich
2004; Zoccali et al. 2003; Ness et al. 2013a; Gonzalez
et al. 2015b), and several recent works show that their
chemical patterns strikingly resemble those of stars at
the solar vicinity (Mel´endez et al. 2008; Alves-Brito
et al. 2010; Bensby et al. 2010; Ryde et al. 2010; Gonza-
lez et al. 2011a, 2015b; Ryde et al. 2015; Ness & Free-
man 2015), once the outer disc sequence – present at
the solar vicinity and not in the inner disc (see next
Section) – is removed from the comparison. It is im-
portant here to note that previous works (McWilliam
& Rich 1994; Rich & Origlia 2005; Zoccali et al. 2006;
Lecureur et al. 2007; Hill et al. 2011; Johnson et al.
2011) have pointed out a diﬀerence between the chem-
istry of the bulge and that of the thick disc at the solar
vicinity, with bulge stars being more α−enhanced than
thick disc stars of the same metallicity. This argument

1

2
naturally led to exclude that the α−enhanced popula-
tion of the bulge could be the result of the secular evo-
lution of the disc, via bar formation (see for example
Zoccali et al. 2006), as suggested also by chemical evo-
lution models (Matteucci & Brocato 1990; Matteucci &
Romano 1999; Ballero et al. 2007). However, in more
recent studies, these diﬀerences appear much less dra-
matic than previous ﬁndings. Quoting Johnson et al.
(2011), for example: “While [..] the [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe],
and [α/Fe] ratios are generally enhanced by ∼ 0.2 dex in
bulge giants compared to thick disk giants (and dwarfs),
this enhancement is not extraordinarily diﬀerent than
the combined measurement uncertainty and choice of
abundance normalization scale [...]. Interestingly, both
the thick disk and bulge appear to show similar de-
clines in the [α/Fe] ratio at [Fe/H]≈ −0.3.” Indeed the
current data show that the oﬀset between the chem-
istry of bulge stars and that of discs stars at the solar
vicinity (see Bensby et al. 2010; Gonzalez et al. 2011a;
Adibekyan et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2014; Ryde et al.
2015) is comparable to the existing systematics between
spectroscopic studies of stars in the solar neighborhood
(compare, for example, Alves-Brito et al. 2010; Gonza-
lez et al. 2011a; Adibekyan et al. 2012; Bensby et al.
2014) or between the diﬀerences among diﬀerent bulge
studies (Gonzalez et al. 2011a; Bensby et al. 2010; John-
son et al. 2012, 2014; Van der Swaelmen et al. 2016).

Evidence about the presence of multiple components,
or populations, in the bulge comes from the investiga-
tion of its metallicity distribution function (hereafter
MDF), at diﬀerent latitudes and longitudes (Babusi-
aux et al. 2010; Hill et al. 2011; Uttenthaler et al.
2012; Ness et al. 2013a; Rojas-Arriagada et al. 2014;
Gonzalez et al. 2015b). In the largest spectroscopic
study of the bulge conducted so far, the ARGOS sur-
vey (Freeman et al. 2013), Ness et al. (2013a) de-
composed the global MDFs found at latitudes b =
−5◦,−7.5◦,−10◦ (integrated over the whole range of
longitudes −15◦ ≤ l ≤ 15◦) into ﬁve gaussian compo-
nents, called A, B, C, D and E, whose metallicities peak
at about [Fe/H]=0.1 dex, -0.3 dex, -0.7 dex, -1.2 dex and
-1.7 dex, respectively. Of those ﬁve components, D and
E are negligible in the ﬁelds considered, representing
6% at most of the whole sample, while the proportion
of populations A, B and C has been shown to vary with
the height from the plane: A represents about 40% of
the sample at b = −5◦, and decreases to 16% and 12%,
respectively, at b = −7.5◦ and b = −10◦; the C compo-
nent, on the opposite, increases with the height from the
plane, passing from 20% at b = −5◦ to 30% at b = −7.5◦
and to roughly 40% at b = −10◦; B shows the smallest
variations, and its fractional contribution to the bulge is
signiﬁcant at all latitudes considered in this study (40%
at b = −5◦, 50% at b = −7.5◦, 44% at b = −10◦). The
diﬀerent proportion of these components with height
above the plane naturally explains the existence of a

vertical metallicity gradient in the bulge, as reported
by Ness et al. (2013a) and even before in the studies
of Zoccali et al. (2008); Gonzalez et al. (2011b, 2013).
Interestingly, it has been shown that the structural and
kinematic properties change from one component to the
other (Ness et al. 2013b,a). The most metal rich com-
ponents A and B, characterized by [Fe/H]≥ −0.5 dex,
show a split in the distribution of K-magnitudes of
their red clump stars. This distribution is particularly
suitable to understand the underlying morphology. The
density of a peanut-shaped bulge indeed shows some
minimum in the centre, on its minor axis, minimum
which is more accentuated at higher latitudes. On the
line of sight, this produces a bimodal distribution, or
a split, in the apparent K-magnitude of the red clump.
In particular, it appears that in the Milky Way bulge
the deepest minima between peaks in the K-magnitude
distribution are found in the most metal-rich popula-
tion (i.e. population A, see Fig. 1 reproduced from Ness
et al. 2013a). At the latitudes covered by ARGOS, com-
ponent C does not show any split. Interestingly, how-
ever, the maximum in the K-magnitude distribution of
its stars is not located at K= 12.9, as would be expected
from a population which reaches its maximum density
in the Galaxy centre, but rather it seems to peak where
the far lobe of the peanut of populations A and B is
found (again, see Fig. 1 here reproduced from Ness et al.
2013a) . I will comment more on this point in Sect. 3.
At any given latitude, populations A, B and C also show
diﬀerent kinematics (Ness et al. 2013b). In particular,
while the rotation curve, as deduced from radial veloc-
ities, is very similar in the three populations at all lat-
itudes1, showing that the cylindrical rotation observed
globally is also reproduced by each component individ-
ually, the velocity dispersions change with latitude and
depend on the population examined. Component B has
velocity dispersion proﬁles similar to A (but with higher
absolute values), while component C shows dispersions
constant both with longitude and latitude (see Fig. 6
in Ness et al. 2013b). As previously said, other studies
have shown that the bulge MDF can be decomposed in
multiple components. Depending on the number of com-
ponents found (two in Babusiaux et al. 2010; Hill et al.
2011; Bensby et al. 2011; Uttenthaler et al. 2012; Rojas-
Arriagada et al. 2014; Gonzalez et al. 2015b, and ﬁve
in Ness et al. (2013a)), the fraction of stars attributed
to the metal-rich and metal-poor component(s) change,
and accordingly their structural and kinematic proper-
ties.
Finally, few words on the ages of stars in the bulge.
Isochrone ﬁtting of main-sequence turnoﬀ stars in the
bulge have lead to the general conclusion that the

(20%) value of the rotational velocity for component B, when
compared to A and C.

Figure 1. From Ness et al. (2013a): Magnitude distribution of red clump stars along the bulge minor axis, at latitudes b =
−5◦, −7.5◦andb = −10◦. The clump stars are splitter into three diﬀerent metallicity bins : [Fe/H] > 0 (red curve), −0.5 dex < [Fe/H] < 0
and [Fe/H] < −0.5 dex.

majority of the stars in the bulge are old, typically
(cid:38) 10 Gyr (Terndrup 1988; Holtzman et al. 1993; Or-
tolani et al. 1995; Feltzing & Gilmore 2000; Zoccali et al.
2003; Clarkson et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2010; Valenti
et al. 2013). Such old ages have been interpreted as
evidence that the bulge is a classical spheroid, that is
a structure formed by mergers in the early phases of
the Milky Way evolution (Ortolani et al. 1995; Zoccali
et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2010). However, some ﬁndings
are questioning this picture. The dating of microlensed
dwarf stars in the bulge at latitudes −5◦ ≤ b ≤ −2◦ has
shown, indeed, that the most metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>
−0.4 dex) show a range in stellar ages from 3 to 12
Gyr (Bensby et al. 2013, , see also Fig. 1 in Ness et al.
(2014)). Young stars are not expected to be present in a
classical spheroid, formed at early times, but are a nat-
ural outcome of a bulge formed secularly, through the
bar (Ness et al. 2014). Moreover, very recently the VVV
survey (Minniti et al. 2010) has reported the presence of
numerous classical Cepheids (ages ≤ 100 Myr) close to
the Galaxy mid-plane (latitudes −1.7◦ ≤ b ≤ 2◦) and
distributed along the whole bulge longitudinal extent
(D´ek´any et al. 2015). The recent ﬁndings about the ages
of stars in the bulge strengthen the global picture traced
so far about the composite nature of this structure.
Overall the bulge shows a very well deﬁned vertical
structuring: the coldest, most metal-rich and youngest
components are preferentially found at low latitudes
and the weight of the dynamically hottest and most
metal-poor components (−1 ≤[Fe/H]≤ −0.5 dex) in-
creases with height from the plane. A population with
intermediate metallicity (−0.5 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0 dex, pop-
ulation B in Ness et al. (2013a)) is however found at all
latitudes in similar proportions. In the following of this

PASA (2016)

review, I will discuss how it is possible to explain the
trends observed for the main populations of the Galac-
tic bulge – those with [Fe/H](cid:38) −1 dex– in a scenario
where these populations originate from the thin and
thick discs of the Milky Way. I will not discuss fur-
ther about stars with [Fe/H](cid:46) −1 dex, whose origin is
very likely linked to the Galactic halo and/or the very
early phases of Galactic formation (Diemand et al. 2005;
Tumlinson 2010; Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2013; Ness et al.
2013a; Howes et al. 2014, 2015).

2 THE GALACTIC DISC(S)

To understand the nature and origin of the Milky Way
bulge it is necessary to locate it in its environment: the
Galaxy, and in particular its stellar disc(s). To present
our most recent view of the Galactic discs, I have chosen
to maintain the classical nomenclature adopted in the
literature.

The thick disc belongs to a sequence which extends
from high [α/Fe] and low metallicities until it joins
the metal-rich thin disc, at solar [α/Fe] and super-solar
metallicities. Because of the reasons recalled in the fol-
lowing of this section, I will refer to this sequence –
running from the metal-poor thick disc to the metal-
rich thin disc – also as the “inner disc sequence”. It is
useful to remind at this point that this sequence shows
a continuity in chemical patterns, with stellar ages de-
creasing with increasing metallicities from about 13 Gyr
– for the oldest thick disc – to ages of about 9–10 Gyr
– for the young thick disc – to ages younger than 8 Gyr
for the metal-rich thin disc (see Fig. 2 and Haywood
et al. 2013). However, this continuity in chemical pat-
terns hides a halt in the star formation history of the

be derived by Haywood et al. (2013). The colors and the sizes of the symbols code the age of the stars. In this plot, the thick disc
appears as the sequence which extends from high [α/Fe] and low metallicities until it joins the metal-rich thin disc, at solar [α/Fe]
and super-solar metallicities. In the text, this sequence is also called the “inner disc sequence”. The metal-poor thin disc extends from
[Fe/H]∼ -0.7 dex and super-solar [α/Fe] to higher metallicities ([Fe/H]∼ −0.3 dex), but with the caveat that especially the upper limit
in metallicity of this sequence is very uncertain. This sequence represents that of the “outer thin disc”. See Haywood et al. (2013) and
discussion in the text for the reasons behind the use of this nomenclature.

inner disc, which took place at the transition from the
thick to the thin disc formation (Haywood et al. 2016).
In the following, I use also the nomenclature “inner thin
disc” : this is essentially equivalent to the metal-rich
thin disc, since – as we will see in Sect. 2.2 – the thin
disc in the inner regions reduces to the metal-rich thin
disc sequence only.

([Fe/H]∼ −0.3 dex), but with the caveat that especially
the upper limit in metallicity of this sequence is very un-
certain. I will refer to this sequence also as that of the
“outer thin disc”.
The Sun is at the interface of the inner and outer thin
discs, in a ∼3 kpc wide region that shares chemical
properties of both the inner and outer discs.
The “inner/outer disc” nomenclature used in this pa-
per has been already adopted in Haywood et al. (2013),
where we emphasized that “there is perhaps more con-
tinuity between the thin and thick discs than between
the inner thin disc and outer thin disc. The inner thin
disc and the thick disc seem to be more like the same
structure [...] while the outer disc appears more like a
separate component” (see also Fig. 2). In the following,
I will review the main reasons behind this vision, and
explain why the most recent discoveries about the stel-
lar populations of the Milky Way discs and their mutual
links are of fundamental importance also for our under-
standing of the bulge, and its main components.

2.1 The thick disc

The thick disc, the last component discovered in the
Milky Way in the early 80s (Gilmore & Reid 1983)
has been for longtime seen as a population formed in
a short-lived (∼1 Gyr) starburst episode produced at
early epochs (Burkert et al. 1992; Chiappini et al. 1997,
1999; Mashonkina & Gehren 2001; Fuhrmann 2004;
Reid 2005; Bernkopf & Fuhrmann 2006), chemically
separated from the stellar thin disc (Fuhrmann 1998),
and with a rotational lag with respect to thin disc stars
between 50 and 100 km/s (Norris 1986; Wyse & Gilmore
1986; Freeman 1987; Ojha et al. 1994; Chiba & Beers
2000; Fuhrmann 2008; Bensby et al. 2014). With a scale
length estimated to be similar or greater then that of the
thin disc (Ojha 2001; Robin et al. 2003; Juri´c et al. 2008;
de Jong et al. 2010) on the basis of color-selection stud-
ies, and with a thick-to-thin disc volume density nor-
malization at the solar vicinity of 10% at most (Robin
et al. 2003; Juri´c et al. 2008), it has been long consid-
ered as a minor contributor to the mass budget of the
Galaxy, constituting about 20% of the thin disc mass
(Robin et al. 2003). We will see in the following that the
estimates of thick disc scale lengths and mass have been
signiﬁcantly revised. But before moving to discuss these
new estimates, I will recall the main processes proposed
for the formation of thick discs in galaxies.

Many diﬀerent scenarios have been indeed suggested
to explain thick discs formation. N-body models have
shown that accretion of satellites can heat a kinemati-

cally cold disc and form, in few Gyrs, thick discs with
vertical sizes, rotational lags, stellar eccentricities and
masses similar to those observed for the Milky Way
for appropriate orbital parameters, mass ratios and gas
fractions of the progenitor galaxies (Quinn et al. 1993;
Walker et al. 1996; Huang & Carlberg 1997; Sellwood
et al. 1998; Velazquez & White 1999; Bekki & Chiba
2001; H¨anninen & Flynn 2002; Read et al. 2008; Vil-
lalobos & Helmi 2008, 2009; Purcell et al. 2009; Moster
et al. 2010; Qu et al. 2010, 2011; House et al. 2011;
Bekki & Tsujimoto 2011; Di Matteo et al. 2011; Moster
et al. 2012). One of the main objection to this scenario
is that it should lead to a ﬂaring of the disc (Bournaud
et al. 2009), while usually these structures are not ob-
served to ﬂare (van der Kruit & Searle 1982; de Grijs
1998; Comer´on et al. 2011). Note however that recently
it has been shown that it is possible to reconcile an ap-
parent lack of ﬂaring with thick disc formed via satellite
heating (Minchev et al. 2015).
Mergers of gas rich subunits, in which discs form thick
ab initio, are also a viable mechanism of formation
(Brook et al. 2004, 2007; Richard et al. 2010).
Clumpy disc galaxies, where massive gas and stellar over
densities scatter stars in a pre-existing thin disc, making
the overall disc thicker, have also been shown to be able
to form thick structures in about 1 Gyr (Bournaud et al.
2009), as suggested by Noguchi (1996). However, this
scenario may have diﬃculties in explaining the chemo-
kinematic relations satisﬁed by thick disc stars in the
Milky Way (see Inoue & Saitoh 2014).
Finally secular evolution processes, like radial migra-
tion, have been suggested to be able to explain the
characteristics of the thick disc at the solar vicinity,
namely its structure, kinematic and chemical properties
(Sch¨onrich & Binney 2009b; Loebman et al. 2011). How-
ever, the eﬀectiveness of this process in heating the disc
has been repeatedly questioned (Minchev et al. 2012;
Vera-Ciro et al. 2014; Halle et al. 2015).

These “classical” picture and scenarios have been re-

cently challenged by a number of ﬁndings.

• Large scale spectroscopic surveys, like SEGUE and
APOGEE, have shown the existence of a struc-
tural continuity between the thick and thin discs
(Bovy et al. 2012a,b, 2015), and inside the thick
disc itself. The morphological-chemical structuring
of the thick disc can be appreciated in Fig. 3 re-
produced from Bovy et al. (2012b), where the ver-
tical and radial scale lengths of disc stars grouped
in bins of ([α/Fe]-[Fe/H]) – the so-called “mono-
abundance populations” in Bovy et al studies– are
plotted, with colors coding the [α/Fe] and [Fe/H],
respectively. Alpha-abundant (i.e. [α/Fe]>∼ 0.2-
0.3 dex in the Bovy et al. (2012b) scale), thick
disc stars are characterized by short scale lengths,
and have scale heights that diminish with decreas-

ing [α/Fe] and increasing [Fe/H]2. Overall, the
α−enhanced thick disc has a scale length signiﬁ-
cantly shorter than that of the thin disc as a whole
(∼2 kpc for the thick disc, and about 3.6 kpc for
the thin; see Bovy et al. 2012b; Cheng et al. 2012).
This scale length is about a factor of two smaller
than previous estimates (Ojha 2001; Juri´c et al.
2008; de Jong et al. 2010). That the thick disc had
a shorter scale length than the thin disc was also
found by means of high-resolution spectroscopic
studies, which suggest a scale length for this pop-
ulation similar to that found by APOGEE and
SEGUE (see Bensby et al. 2011).

2Note however that this trend of decreasing scale height with de-
creasing [α/F e] may not be valid for stars in the highest [α/F e]
bins, see Minchev et al. (2014); Guiglion et al. (2015)

• The analysis and dating of high spectroscopic data
for stars at the solar vicinity have shown that the
stars in the Galactic disc(s) satisfy a very well de-
ﬁned [α/Fe]-age relation and that the α−enhanced
thick disc formed in a prolonged burst of star
formation (lasting 3-4 Gyr, see Haywood et al.
(2013)). Note that since those stars span a wide
range of pericentre and apocentre distances, up to
1-2 kiloparsecs from the Galactic centre, this re-
lation is not local but should apply to the whole
thick disc (see discussion in Haywood et al. 2015).
• The imprint left on the chemical abundances of
long-lived stars at the solar vicinity coupled with
a chemical evolution model, allowed to derive a
robust measurement of the Milky Way star forma-
tion history and to recognize that, in the Milky
Way, the thick disc stellar population is as mas-
sive as its thin disc counterpart, suggesting a fun-
damental role of this component in the genesis of
our Galaxy (Snaith et al. 2014, 2015).

That the thick disc is massive ﬁnds two independent

conﬁrmations.

1. In the most recent thick disc scale length measure-
ments: as discussed in Snaith et al. (2014), from
the stellar surface densities derived from SEGUE
(Bovy et al. 2012b,c) and assuming that the thick
and thin discs separate at [α/Fe] = 0.25 dex (on
the SEGUE scale Bovy et al. 2012b), the thin
disc contributes ∼ 21M(cid:12)pc−2 to the local stellar
surface density, and the thick disc ∼ 8M(cid:12)pc−2.
Correcting for the scale length eﬀect, the thick
disc represents ∼47% of the stellar mass within 10
kpc of the galactic centre, in accordance with the
estimates derived from the star formation history
and chemical modeling.

2. In the census of white dwarf stars at the solar
vicinity : Fuhrmann et al. (2012) revised the frac-
tion of local white dwarfs belonging to the thin
and thick discs, respectively, ﬁnding a larger frac-
tion of thick disc white dwarfs than what suggested
by previous estimates. This ﬁnding, coupled with
the diﬀerent scale lengths and heights of the two
populations, lead Fuhrmann et al. (2012) to the
conclusion that the thin disc is not dominant in
the Milky Way, and that very likely the two pop-
ulations have equal masses.

The most recent ﬁndings thus point to the presence
of a massive thick disc, as massive as the thin counter-
part, whose density at the solar vicinity is not represen-
tative of the global thick-to-thin mass ratio, and which
is mainly concentrated in the inner disc. Explaining the
formation of such a massive and centrally concentrated

component is of course challenging for any evolution-
ary model: it would require high mass fractions already
in place at high redshift to sustain the prolonged star
formation (Snaith et al. 2014, 2015; Haywood et al.
2015), it is at odds with secular evolution models which
only predict a marginal contribution of the thick disc to
the overall mass budget of the Galaxy (Minchev et al.
2012), it requires mergers and accretion events to be
ﬁne tuned enough to generate (or preserve?) kinematics-
chemistry(-age) relations as those observed today on lo-
cal and kpc-scale data (see Haywood et al. (2013); Bovy
et al. (2012a,b,c) and Bird et al. (2013); Stinson et al.
(2013) for predictions from cosmological models).

2.2 The thin disc

In the “classical” picture, the thin disc is the dominant
and most massive stellar component of the Galaxy. Un-
til few years ago, its kinematic and chemical properties
were mostly known for stars at the solar vicinity. From
kinematics studies, it has been inferred that the stars at
the solar radius are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the stellar
Galactic bar : the Sun seems indeed to be located just
outside the outer Lindblad resonance (hereafter OLR,
see Dehnen 1999, 2000; Fux 2001; Minchev et al. 2007),
and several moving groups in the solar vicinity have
been ascribed to the eﬀect of bar resonances (Dehnen
2000; Chakrabarty 2007; Famaey et al. 2007, 2008; An-
toja et al. 2009). For stars conﬁned at about a hun-
dred parsecs from the Sun, where ages have been deter-
mined with suﬃcient accuracy, data show the existence
of velocity dispersions - age relations for disc stars, with
the older the stars the higher their dispersions (Wielen
1977; Dehnen & Binney 1998; Binney et al. 2000; Nord-
str¨om et al. 2004; Seabroke & Gilmore 2007), but note
that some studies suggest a possible saturation for stars
older than few Gyrs (Freeman 1991; Edvardsson et al.
1993; Gomez et al. 1997; Quillen & Garnett 2001; Soubi-
ran et al. 2008). These trends may be the signature of
internal processes which kinematically heat stars over
time (e.g. Spitzer & Schwarzschild 1951; Lacey 1984;
Carlberg & Sellwood 1985; Kroupa 2002). But they may
also reﬂect a much more global trend observed in all
disc stars, belonging to the thin as well as to the thick
disc population. These two populations, examined as a
whole, show a continuous decrease of velocity disper-
sions with age, from the oldest thick disc stars to the
youngest thin disc objects (Haywood et al. 2013). How-
ever, it is not clear how representative this relation is of
the initial formation of the disc(s) and how much inter-
nal processes (heating by spiral arms, bar formation and
buckling, etc) and accretion events may have changed it
over time, also because diﬀerent evolutionary scenarios
may be able to produce similar relations at the present
epoch (House et al. 2011).
From the chemical point of view, the thin disc shows sig-

natures of a complex formation history. Stars at the so-
lar vicinity have a metallicity distribution which peaks
around [Fe/H]∼0 (Haywood 2001), with the tails of the
distribution extending from [Fe/H]∼-0.8 dex to super
solar values. The large spread in metallicities of stars at
the solar vicinity may be appreciated also looking at the
age-metallicity relation: at any age, the dispersion is too
signiﬁcant to be explained simply by inhomogeneities in
the interstellar medium at the time of formation of the
diﬀerent generations of stars (Haywood 2008; Haywood
et al. 2013). Some other processes have been thus in-
voked. Radial migration (Roˇskar et al. 2008; Brunetti
et al. 2011; Minchev et al. 2011; Brook et al. 2012;
Minchev et al. 2013; Miranda et al. 2015) has been,
over the last ten years, the most popular scenario to
explain the metallicity and abundance distributions of
stars at the solar vicinity, starting from the early sugges-
tion by Sellwood & Binney (2002). N-body models have
repeatedly found that radial migration (both blurring
and churning, following the terminology of Sch¨onrich
& Binney 2009a) is a global process, stimulated by the
presence of one or multiple stellar asymmetries, and as
such it should have naturally aﬀected the whole disc.
However, this seems at odds with a number of more re-
cent ﬁndings (see, for example, Haywood et al. 2013;
Halle et al. 2015, and the following of this section) that
question the strength of radial migration and the spatial
extent over which it is able to operate in our Galaxy.
Many studies are indeed revealing that the thin disc
appears radially structured, with little contamination
between the inner thin disc (RGC ≤ 6 − 7 kpc, with
RGC being the in-plane distance from the Galactic cen-
tre) and the outer thin disc (RGC ≥ 10 kpc). It is only
in an intermediate region containing the solar radius
(6 − 7 kpc≤ RGC ≤ 10 kpc) that the chemical patterns
of the inner and outer disc coexist. This result is fun-
damental not only because it questions the borders of
radial migration, but also for the comprehension of the
bulge components. For this reason, I will devote the rest
of the section in revising the evidence of this inner-outer
disc dycothomy.

A ﬁrst indication comes from the work of Haywood
(2008), who shows that thin disc stars at the solar vicin-
ity do not all share the same orbital properties: most of
the metal-rich thin disc stars ([Fe/H]≥ 0.1 dex) found
at the solar vicinity tend to have pericentres inside the
solar radius, up to few kpc from the Galactic centre, and
apocentres at or just outside the solar position, while
metal-poor thin disc stars ([Fe/H]≤ −0.4 dex) have or-
bits which do not penetrate so much in the inner disc
(their pericentres are usually above 6 kpc) and their
apocentres extend much further out in the outer disc,
up to 12 kpc from the Galaxy centre (see Fig. 4).

A second indication comes from the work of Bensby
et al. (2011) : this study reveals that the (thin+thick
discs) chemical patterns found at the solar radius are

ically selected as thin disc stars in the Geneva Copenhagen survey

denced by Haywood (2008), thin disc stars at the solar vicinity do
not all share the same orbital properties: most of the metal-rich
thin disc stars ([Fe/H]≥ 0.1 dex) tend to have pericentres inside
the solar radius, up to few kpc from the Galactic centre, and
apocentres at or just outside the solar position, while metal-poor
thin disc stars ([Fe/H]≤ −0.4 dex) have orbits with pericentres
above 6 kpc and with apocentres which extend much further out
in the disc, up to ∼12 kpc from the Galaxy centre.

not representative of the whole disc. Only at the so-
lar vicinity the two patterns – the one going from
[α/Fe]∼0.4 dex and [Fe/H]∼-1 dex to solar values, and
the one going from [α/Fe]∼0.2 dex and [Fe/H]∼-0.7 dex
(red and blue lines, respectively, in Fig. 2 of their work)–
coexist. In their inner disc sample, made of stars with
distances from the galactic centre between 4 and 7 kpc,
the second pattern is not present, while it is the only
pattern that appears in the outer disc (distances be-
tween 9 and 13 kpc). In particular, it is striking to ob-
serve that metal-rich thin disc stars, present at the so-
lar vicinity, are not found in the outer disc, at distances
greater than ∼ 9 kpc from the galaxy centre. In Hay-
wood et al. (2013), we have re-investigated the question,
calculating the ages of a high resolution spectroscopic
sample of stars at the solar vicinity (from Adibekyan
et al. 2012). From this study, we concluded that the in-
ner (RGC ≤ 6 − 7 kpc) and outer (RGC ≥ 10 kpc) discs
did not follow the same chemical evolution: at a given
age, outer disc stars are more α−enriched than co-eval
inner disc stars, and have metallicities up to ∼ 0.4 dex
lower. Having detailed chemical abundances and ages,
in Snaith et al. (2014, 2015), we reconstructed the star
formation histories of the inner and outer discs, show-
ing that the outer disc started to form about 10 Gyr
ago, from an interstellar medium whose metallicity was
diluted by 0.3–0.4 dex with respect to the metallicity
of the interstellar medium present in the inner disc at

PASA (2016)

the same time. In Haywood et al. (2013), we proposed
that the outer regions of the Milky Way possibly formed
from a mixture of enriched material expelled from the
thick disc, and of accreted, metal-poor gas. Afterwards,
the evolution of the outer disc remained essentially dis-
connected from that of the inner disc. All these studies,
except that of Bensby et al. (2011), have been based on
the analysis of stars at the solar vicinity. The deﬁnite
conﬁrmation that this picture is correct, and that the
chemical patterns of the inner and outer discs are dif-
ferent and co-exist only in the solar region comes from
APOGEE. The distribution in the [α-Fe]-[Fe/H] plane
of about 70,000 stars in the APOGEE survey, span-
ning a large range of distances from the Sun, is shown
in Hayden et al. (2015) and here reproduced in Fig. 5.
This ﬁgure perfectly summarizes the points made in this
section :

• the α−enhanced thick disc is centrally concen-
trated – very few thick disc stars are indeed ob-
served at distances greater than 10–11 kpc from
the Galaxy centre;
• in a 2-kpc wide region around the Sun, two chem-
ical patterns are observed : one going from α −
enhanced, metal-poor thick disc stars to solar
[α/Fe] and super–solar [Fe/H] values, the second
pattern starting at [α/Fe]∼ 0.1 dex and [Fe/H]∼
−0.5 dex with [Fe/H] increasing up to solar val-

ues. These two patterns co-exist only in a few
kpc region around the Sun : in the outer disc the
α−enhanced pattern disappears, while in the inner
disc, it is the low-α sequence which is not present.

There are at least two implications of these results

which are of interest for our study:

• Radial migration by churning (Sellwood & Bin-
ney 2002; Sch¨onrich & Binney 2009a; Roˇskar et al.
2008; Minchev et al. 2013), that is the change of
guiding radii of stars caused by the presence of
one or multiple asymmetries in the stellar disc,
has not been eﬃcient in mixing stars of the in-
ner (RGC ≤ 6 − 7 kpc) and outer Milky Way disc
(RGC ≥ 9 − 10 kpc). The diﬀerence of chemical
patterns of these two regions of the Galaxy, with
an overlap only in a few-kpc zone around the Sun,
implies that no siginiﬁcant migration of stars has
occurred between these two regions. Whatever the
formation scenario for the outer disc of the Milky
Way is (gas/satellites accretion with a possible
role of winds from the inner disc), and whatever
the process that ignited star formation in those
outer regions about 10 Gyr ago, some mechanism
has prevented stars from migrating afterwards. In
Halle et al. (2015), we propose that the mechanism
that inhibited migration is dynamical and is re-
lated to the position of the bar OLR, position that
is currently estimated to be just inside the solar
radius. By using N-body models, we show indeed
that the bar OLR limits the exchange of angu-
lar momentum, separating the disc in two distinct
parts with minimal exchange, except in the transi-
tion zone, which is delimited by the position of the
OLR at the epoch of the formation of the bar, and
at the ﬁnal epoch. This also implies that stars mi-
grated in the bar/bulge region from the outer disc
can originate in a region whose maximal extent
is given by the ﬁnal (i.e. current) position of the
OLR (Di Matteo et al. 2014). Unless the Galaxy,
over time, has experienced the formation of sev-
eral bars, and/or strong spiral waves, with diﬀer-
ent pattern speeds (in that case the scenario would
become much more complex), the picture is simple
: only stars inside the solar region, where the OLR
should be currently located, can have migrated in
the inner disc and contributed to the bulge popula-
tions.
• The chemical patterns of the inner disc are only
part of the chemical patterns observed at the so-
lar radius. When one compares the chemistry of
bulge stars to those of disc stars, it is fundamen-
tal to take this result into account.
In particu-
lar, if the comparison is done with the chemical
patterns observed at the solar vicinity, the low-α

PASA (2016)

pattern of the metal-poor thin disc must not be
taken into account in the comparison, simply be-
cause this pattern is typical of the outer disc and
not of the region inside 6–7 kpc from the Galaxy
centre. The chemical patterns of the bulge diﬀer
from those of the stellar disc at the solar vicinity
as much as the latter diﬀers from the chemical pat-
terns of the inner disc. The diﬀerence in chemical
patterns of the bulge and of the thin disc at the
solar radius arises because the solar radius is not
representative of the chemistry of the inner thin
disc, not because the metal-rich bulge is a diﬀer-
ent population from the inner thin disc. In this
respect, the α−enhancement of the bulge with re-
spect to the thin disc found, for example, by John-
son et al. (2011); Gonzalez et al. (2015b) arises be-
cause the whole thin disc is included in the com-
parison, while the metal-poor thin disc present at
the solar vicinity should be removed. Once this is
done, the ﬁliation between the inner thin disc and
the metal-rich bulge becomes evident.

3 THE BULGE/BAR/DISC(S)
CONNECTION IN N-BODY
SIMULATIONS

The observational evidences recalled in the previous sec-
tions suggest to investigate the nature of the bulge and
its stellar components in view of the recent discover-
ies about the disc(s) populations (Sects. 1 and 2). It
is by quantifying and understanding the response of a
thin+thick disc to bar formation and instabilities that
we can solve the puzzle of the main (i.e. [Fe/H]≥ −1)
populations of the Galactic bulge.

In the following of this section, I will discuss three
points, that are fundamental to me to understand why
our current modeling of the Milky Way bulge is incom-
plete.

1. N-body simulations which try to interpret the
Milky Way bulge as the result of a bar instabil-
ity in a pure thin disc galaxy fail in reproduc-
ing the chemo-kinematic relations, as found in the
most recent surveys. They are successful in repro-
ducing global trends, but not the trends satisﬁed
by the individual bulge components. This failure
has been evidenced in Di Matteo et al. (2015),
and I will summarize here the main points made
in that paper, after recalling the successes of the
bulge/bar/thin disc scenario.

2. If the Milky Way contains any classical bulge, its
mass must be small (not more than 10%). Several
independent N-body models have now reached this
same conclusion, and this also means that the ori-
gin of the metal-poor populations which are signif-
icant in the bulge – 60% and more, depending on

10

P. Di Matteo

latitude, for stars with [Fe/H]≤ 0 dex; up to 40%
for stars with [Fe/H]≤ −0.5 dex only; according
to Ness et al. (2013a) – cannot be ascribed to the
presence of a classical bulge, which makes 10% at
most of the thin disc mass.

3. Neither a pure thin disc model nor the inclu-
sion of a low-mass classical bulge can explain the
properties of the metal-poor component present
in the bulge. It is only by adding the thick disc
to the picture that we can naturally understand
the vertical structuring of the bulge, the vari-
ation of metal-rich and metal-poor components
with height, their relative weight, and the absence
of a boxy/peanut-shaped structure for the metal-
poor (−1 dex≤[Fe/H]≤ −0.5 dex) stars at lati-
tudes b ≥ −10◦. I will show this, by presenting the
ﬁrst results of N-body simulations which include
a massive thick disc, and that have high enough
resolution to allow to study in detail the mapping
of a thin+thick disc into a boxy bulge.

3.1 The bar/bulge/thin disc connection :

successes and failures

Successes
Because of the boxy/peanut-shaped nature of the Milky
Way bulge and because of the marginal role that the
thick disc was considered to play in the mass budget of
the Galaxy until recently, all N-body models so far – ex-
cept those of Bekki & Tsujimoto (2011) – have modeled
the visible Galaxy as a pure thin disc, with the possi-
ble inclusion of a classical bulge. These models, which
I will refer to also as “pure thin disc” models – even in
the case they contain a small (∼ 10%) classical bulge,
as in Shen et al. (2010); Di Matteo et al. (2015) – have
been successful in reproducing a number of global char-
acteristics of the Milky Way bulge, as its structure and
X-shape, its kinematics and metallicity trends.
Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard (2011) and Gerhard &
Martinez-Valpuesta (2012), for example, showed how
a pure thin disc model can be able to reproduce star
counts observations in the Galactic plane, for the long
bar, and in the inner regions of the boxy bulge (−10◦ ≤
l ≤ 10◦ and b = ±1◦), where a sudden change in the
structure of the bulge is observed at |l| ∼ 4◦ (Nishiyama
et al. 2005; Gonzalez et al. 2011c). By means of a N-
body model of a stellar bar grown from a thin disc, Ness
et al. (2012) were able to explain the split in the dis-
tribution of red giant clump stars along the bar minor
axis, as observed by ARGOS.

The pure thin disc model developed by Shen et al.
(2010) has been successful in explaining the stellar kine-
matics of the bulge region from the BRAVA bulge sur-
vey (Howard et al. 2008), at latitudes b = −4◦,−6◦
and −8◦ and longitudes −10◦ ≤ b ≤ +10◦. In partic-

Figure 6. From Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard (2013): Bulge
metallicity maps of a simulated thin disc galaxy in galactic co-
ordinates (l, b). The modeled galaxy has initially a steep radial
metallicity gradient in the disc, that is mapped into a verti-
cal metallicity gradient in the bulge, when the bar buckles. The
trends found are remarkably similar to observations (Gonzalez
et al. 2013). However, even if successful in reproducing global
bulge properties, a pure thin disc model for the Galactic bulge
–as the one presented here – fails in reproducing the detailed
chemo-kinematic relations of its stars (see Fig. 8 and Di Matteo
et al. (2015)).

ular, this N-body simulation reproduces the cylindri-
cal rotation observed all over the analyzed ﬁelds and
the corresponding trends in velocity dispersions. Kun-
der et al. (2012) conﬁrmed this agreement, by com-
paring Shen et al. (2010) model to a more extended
sample of stars from BRAVA at similar latitudes and
longitudes. Similar results were obtained by Gardner
et al. (2014), in their comparison with BRAVA, and
by Zoccali et al. (2014), who used the pure thin disc
N-body model presented in Martinez-Valpuesta & Ger-
hard (2011) and compared it with the bulge kinematics
from the GIBS survey, extending the comparison be-
tween data and models also closer to the Galaxy mid-
plane, at latitude b = −2◦. That a “pure thin disc”
model is able to reproduce the global kinematics of the
bulge has been also shown by Ness et al. (2013b), in
their comparison with the ARGOS kinematics at lati-
tudes b = −5◦,−7.5◦ and −10◦ and by Di Matteo et al.

The disc origin of the Milky Way bulge

11

(2015), who compared their N-body model to ARGOS
and BRAVA data.

Such models have been shown to be able to repro-
duce also the vertical metallicity gradient, similar to
those observed (Zoccali et al. 2008; Gonzalez et al.
2011b, 2013; Ness et al. 2013a). Martinez-Valpuesta
& Gerhard (2013)
indeed showed how an initial
steep (∼ −0.4 dex/kpc) radial metallicity gradient
in the thin disc can be mapped into a comparable
vertical metallicity gradient in the bulge: the most
loosely bound stars, in the disc outskirts, are indeed
preferentially redistributed at large heights from the
plane, while more bound stars tend to be found at low
latitudes (see also Di Matteo et al. 2014). This explain
why, in a pure thin disc which has initially – before
bar formation – a steep enough metallicity gradient,
models predict also longitude-latitude metallicity maps
remarkably similar to observations (see Fig. 6 and
Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard 2013). I will comment
in the following on the limitations of this scenario.
Finally, even if we are only starting to discover the
spatial redistribution of stars with diﬀerent ages in
the Galactic bulge, the most recent ﬁndings (Bensby
et al. 2013; D´ek´any et al. 2015) seem in agreement
with models predictions about the presence of young
stars close to the Galaxy mid-plane, as a consequence
of the continuous star formation in the galactic thin
disc (Ness et al. 2014).

Failures
In the scenario where the bulge formed from a pure
thin disc, through the intermediate of a bar, it is fun-
damental that initially – i.e. before bar formation –
the thin disc has a steep radial metallicity gradient
(∼ −0.4 dex/kpc as found by Martinez-Valpuesta &
Gerhard (2013) and Di Matteo et al. (2015)). In this
way, metal-poor stars originating at large radii in the
thin disc are preferentially mapped at high latitudes in
the Galactic bulge and give rise to a vertical gradient of
about −0.04 dex/deg, similar to the ﬁndings of Gonza-
lez et al. (2013). In this scenario, because all bulge stars
have a thin disc origin, at a given latitude they should
be all part of the boxy/peanut-shaped structure, inde-
pendently on their metallicities. This fact has two conse-
quences, which enter in conﬂict with the detailed struc-
ture and chemo-kinematic relations currently known for
the bulge components :

Figure 7. From Di Matteo et al. (2015): Rotation curve (top
panel) and velocity dispersions (bottom panel) of bulge stars in
the pure thin disc N-body model discussed in Di Matteo et al.
(2015). Four diﬀerent latitudes are shown for the modeled galaxy:

blue squares), b = −10◦ (dark blue squares). For comparison,
BRAVA ﬁelds at b = −4◦ (yellow, solid curve), b = −6◦ (red,

GOS ﬁelds at b = −10◦ (dark blue, dash-dotted curve) are also
given. The thickness of the curves corresponds to the ±1σ error in
the observational data. See also Shen et al. (2010); Kunder et al.
(2012); Zoccali et al. (2014) for similar global kinematic trends.
However, even if successful in reproducing global kinematic prop-
erties, a pure thin disc model – as the one presented here – for the
Galactic bulge fails in reproducing the detailed chemo-kinematic
relations of its stars (see Fig. 8 and Di Matteo et al. (2015)).

of the more metal rich ones (-0.5 dex < [Fe/H]),
which is not.

1. at a given latitude, all red clump stars in the Milky
Way’s bulge with [Fe/H] > −1 dex should show
a split in the distribution of their K-magnitudes,
which is not observed;
2. the metal-poor population (-1 dex< [Fe/H] ≤
−0.5 dex) should be a kinematically warm replica

These failures have been presented and discussed in
Di Matteo et al. (2015), where we have indeed shown
how a “pure thin disc” model can reproduce the global
kinematics and chemistry of the bulge, without re-
producing the detailed chemo-kinematic and structural
properties of its components. The problem is essentially

Figure 9. The scenario proposed in Di Matteo et al. (2014, 2015) for the origin of the bulge components A, B and C (Ness et al.
2013a). In this scenario, the chemical patterns present in the Galactic bulge can be understood in terms of the chemical patterns of
stars at the solar vicinity : the inner (thin+thick) disc sequence is mapped into the boxy bulge, with components A, B and C that
correspond, respectively, to the metal-rich thin disc, the young thick disc and the old thick disc, adopting the nomenclature in Haywood
et al. (2013). Note that in this scenario the outer disc sequence, visible at the solar vicinity, is not present in the boxy bulge. This latter
is indeed representative of the outer disc, not of the inner disc (see Sect. 2.2), and as a consequence it is not mapped into the boxy
bulge.

.

related to the fact that, in such a scenario, metal-poor
stars at any given latitude would contribute to the ex-
ternal part of the peanut and that they would have an
angular momentum greater than that of more metal-
rich stars (whose origin would be in the inner galaxy,
given the initial radial metallicity gradient). A higher
angular momentum for metal-poor stars would break
the cylindrical rotation observed for this component,
and would imply also a rotation curve diﬀerent from
that of the most metal-rich populations. This is not ob-
served in the data, which on the contrary show that
populations A, B and C all show cylindrical rotation
and similar rotation curves. Moreover, because in this
scenario metal-poor stars would have a thin disc ori-
gin, their velocity dispersion proﬁles would have a shape
similar to those of the most metal-rich components, only
shifted at higher absolute values. This again is not ob-
served. As shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8, even if successful
in explaining global properties of the bulge, the “pure
thin disc” model fails in reproducing the properties of
its stellar components (Fig. 8). For a more extensive dis-
cussion on these points, I refer the reader to Di Matteo
et al. (2014) and Di Matteo et al. (2015).

3.2 On the marginal role of any classical

bulge in the Milky Way

If the metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge cannot
have a thin disc origin, can they belong to a classical
bulge ? Several N-body models, starting from those pre-
sented by Shen et al. (2010), and then Kunder et al.
(2012); Di Matteo et al. (2014); Zoccali et al. (2014),

PASA (2016)
doi:10.1017/pas.2016.xxx

show that this is not a viable possibility. They all agree
indeed in ﬁnding that the mass of any classical bulge
present in the Galaxy must be small (10% at most).
Shen et al. (2010), for example, showed that for higher
mass ratios, the classical bulge would determine signa-
tures in the global velocity dispersion proﬁles of stars
in the bulge not compatible with BRAVA observations
(see Fig. 4 in Shen et al. 2010). Subsequent works ar-
rived to similar conclusions. Such a small classical bulge
can explain neither the large fraction of metal poor-stars
observed in the bulge, nor their increasing fraction with
latitude. In Di Matteo et al. (2014, Fig. 11), we have
indeed shown that the contribution of a low-mass clas-
sical bulge to the total stellar density is maximal in the
innermost regions of the bulge (typically inside 0.5 kpc,
where it can account for 20% at most of the total lo-
cal stellar density) and this fraction decreases with in-
creasing latitude. The weight of such a classical bulge,
and its trends with latitude, are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from those observed for components B and/or C by Ness
et al. (2013a), excluding that a low-mass classical bulge
can represent the bulk of these populations.
Moreover, a classical component would leave signatures
in the kinematics of stars in the bulge. Even if stars in
the classical bulge can acquire some angular momen-
tum during the bar formation and evolution (see, for
example Saha et al. 2012; Saha & Gerhard 2013), these
stars do not attain rotational velocities comparable to
those of disc stars, whatever their location in the boxy
structure. This is shown, for example, in Fig. 12 in Di
Matteo et al. (2014), but also in Fux (1997): in this
latter model, the galactocentric radial velocity of the

14

P. Di Matteo

spheroidal component – whose mass is about 50% of
that of the stellar disc – is about half the value found
for disc stars in all bulge ﬁelds (see their Table 5 and
their Fig. 16). This rules out the possibility that the
bulk of the metal-poor stars in the Galactic bulge can
be associated to a spheroid like that modeled by Fux
(1997): if this was the case, metal-poor and metal-rich
stars should show a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent amount of
rotation, something excluded by the data (Ness et al.
2013b, 2015).

3.3 On the bulge/bar/thin+thick disc

connection : towards the solution ?

The previous discussion has shown that neither metal-
poor thin disc stars trapped in the bar instability nor a
classical bulge can explain the relative weight, fraction
as a function of latitude, structure and kinematics of the
metal-poor populations observed in the Galactic bulge.
At the same time, we have learned from the evidences
recalled in Sect. 2 that a thick disc is massively present
in the inner regions of the Milky Way, and that is has
[α/Fe] and [Fe/H] compatible with those of stars in the
bulge. This lead us to suggest in Di Matteo et al. (2014,
2015) that the Milky Way bulge is the result of the
mapping of the thin+thick disc of the Galaxy into the
boxy/peanut shaped structure. In this scenario, we can
understand the chemical patterns present in the Galac-
tic bulge already in terms of the chemical patterns of
stars at the solar vicinity : the inner disc sequence is
mapped into the boxy bulge, while the outer disc se-
quence, which – as we have seen – contains stars with
pericentres slightly inside the solar radius, is not. More
in details, we suggest that components A, B and C ad
deﬁned by Ness et al. (2013a) correspond, respectively,
to the metal-rich thin disc, the young thick disc and the
old thick disc, adopting the nomenclature of Haywood
et al. (2013) and following the scheme presented here in
Fig. 9, and already discussed in Di Matteo et al. (2014,
2015). Note that this scenario is somehow diﬀerent from
the one presented in Ness et al. (2013a): they indeed as-
sociate component C only with the thick disc, while in
their interpretation component B should represent the
early thin disc.

How to test the validity of this scheme with N-body
simulations ? The recent observational results pose a
challenge for idealized models, which have generally
represented the stellar content of a Milky Way-type
galaxy with a thin stellar disc and an optional bulge.
The vertical structuring observed in the data, with
a continuous sequence of “mono-abundance” popula-
tions, whose scale height depends on their [α/Fe] and
[Fe/H], needs to be captured somehow. A solution may
be to use, as initial conditions, snapshots of Milky Way-
like galaxies taken from cosmological simulations, where
“mono-abundance” sequences have been indeed repro-

spectively, accordingly to the nomenclature adopted in Haywood

of thin disc stars decreases with height above the plane, that of
thick disc stars increases with height above the plane, and that of

to those found for populations A, B and C by Ness et al. (2013a).

duced (Bird et al. 2013; Stinson et al. 2013). The limit
of this approach is in the diﬃculty of investigating a
large number of initial conditions, varying thin-to-thick
disc ratios, for example, or disc(s) scale lengths and
heights. To guarantee to have controlled sequences of
(thin+thick) disc models, we have decided to follow a
diﬀerent approach, by constructing idealized galaxies,
containing stellar discs of diﬀerent scale heights and
lengths, with masses and sizes in agreement with the
most recent estimates for the Milky Way. In the follow-
ing, I will show how the mapping of a thin+thick disc

into a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge is done in one of these
simulations, and the kind of trends it predicts. The disc
galaxy modeled here is made of 25 million particles,
redistributed among stars and dark matter. The stel-
lar disc, made of 20 million particles, is structured in
three components (hereafter called “thin”, “’intermedi-
ate” and “thick” discs, respectively) with scale heights
varying from 0.3 kpc, to 0.6 kpc and 0.9 kpc, and with
velocity dispersions at the solar vicinity similar to those
observed for the thin, young thick and old thick disc, re-
spectively (Haywood et al. 2013). The intermediate and

thick disc together constitute 50% of the stellar mass in
the modeled galaxy, with the remaining 50% being in
the thin disc. I would like to highlight here that we chose
to model only three disc components simply to identify
three phases of an otherwise probably continuous chem-
ical evolution. The same is valid for the Galactic bulge :
components A, B and C have been found by ﬁtting the
bulge MDF with multiple gaussians (Ness et al. 2013a).
But the existence of several components in the bulge
MDF does not indicate necessarily that these compo-
nents are really distinct. And indeed, the [α/Fe] versus
[Fe/H] plot of the ARGOS stars presented in Ness et al.
(2013a) shows a continuity between the three compo-
nents.

The modeled galaxy is evolved in isolation for 5 Gyr.
It rapidly develops a stellar bar which buckles after a
couple of Gyrs and forms a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.
A couple of results of this simulation seem worth men-
tioning in this context :

1. Stars of all components contribute to the stel-
lar bar and to the boxy/peanut-shaped structure,
but their relative weight depends on the charac-
teristics of the initial stellar disc (i.e. kinemati-
cally cold or warm) and on the height above the
plane (see Fig. 10). In particular, in our experi-
ment, by integrating over the whole bulge extent,
thin disc stars constitute 40% of the total stel-
lar densities at |z| ≤0.25 kpc, but this fraction di-
minishes to about 25% at 1. kpc≤ z ≤ 1.5 kpc.
Thick disc stars show the opposite trend : they
represent less than 20% of the total stellar den-
sity at |z| ≤0.25 kpc, but their fraction rises to
more than 40% at 1. kpc≤ z ≤ 1.5 kpc. Finally,
the intermediate disc – which in our experiment
should mimic the young thick disc following Hay-
wood et al. (2013) nomenclature – has a weight
which is nearly independent on the vertical dis-
tance from the plane : 40% at |z| ≤0.25 kpc, 35%
at 1. kpc≤ z ≤ 1.5 kpc. Note that at the highest
distances from the plane, intermediate plus thick
disc stars – which should mimic the young plus old
thick disc, that is components B plus C in our sce-
nario – constitute the great majority (75%) of the
local stellar density. Even with the uncertainties
still present in the model (thin-to-thick discs mass
ratios, and in particular the fraction of young and
old thick disc stars to the total thick disc mass; ini-
tial velocity dispersion proﬁles in the inner galaxy,
etc), it is striking to see the similarity with the
ﬁndings of Ness et al. (2013a). In particular the
trends found for our thin and thick discs are rem-
iniscent of those of populations A and C in Ness
et al. (2013a), while our intermediate disc shows

PASA (2016)
doi:10.1017/pas.2016.xxx

a weight whose nearly independence on the height
above the plane is reminiscent of population B.

2. At

a

above

the plane,

given height

the
boxy/peanut shape is more pronounced in the
kinematically cold populations than in the hottest
one (see Fig. 11). In particular, in our experiment,
a clear peanut-shape in the thick disc is only visi-
ble at large heights above the plane, greater than
1 kpc. This has two interesting implications.
Ness et al. (2013a) found that population C does
not show any split in the K-magnitude distribution
of stars at latitudes b = −5◦,−7.5◦ and −10◦, but
interestingly at b = −10◦ the maximum of the K-
magnitude distribution of component C does not
coincide with the Galaxy centre, but is shifted to-
wards K-magnitude values similar to those where
one of the two maxima of the peanut-shaped pop-
ulations A and B is found (see Fig. 1 here repro-
duced from Ness et al. 2013a, and the previous
discussion in Sect. 1). This may indicate the pres-
ence of a weak peanut-shape also in population C,
but possibly visible only at larger distances from
the Galactic plane than those explored by bulge
surveys so far. A mapping of the outer bulge, at
|b| > 10◦, would greatly help in understanding the
morphology of the metal-poor bulge populations,
and to clarify to what extent the characteristics
that we have deduced for these stars from ﬁelds at
|b| ≤ 10◦ are really representative of their ensem-
ble.
The second implication has to do with the spatial
distribution of bulge RR Lyrae stars. D´ek´any et al.
(2013) found that, at latitudes b > −5◦, bulge RR
Lyrae in the VVV survey do not show a strong
barred distribution, as the one traced by metal-
rich red clump stars at similar latitudes, but a
more spherical shape (note however that, at simi-
lar latitudes, Pietrukowicz et al. (2012) found dif-
ferent results : their sample of RR Lyrae stars from
the OGLE-III experiment shows a barred distribu-
tion similar to that of bulge red clump giants). It
may be tempting to use these ﬁndings as indica-
tive of the presence of a classical spheroid in the
bulge. However, our model predicts that a diﬀer-
ent strength in the elongation of the bar in thick
and thin disc stars is expected, especially at small
heights above the plane. Thus, if a diﬀerent spa-
tial distribution was found between RR Lyrae with
[Fe/H](cid:38) −1 dex – i.e. the RR Lyrae population
with metallicities compatible with the thick disc –
and metal-rich red clump giants in the bulge, this
should not be taken as an indication of the pres-
ence of a classical spheroid in the bulge. As we
show in Fig. 11, indeed, the thicker and kinemat-
ically warmer the disc is, the weaker and rounder
its stellar bar. Also the absence of a clear bimodal

distribution in RR Lyrae at b > −5◦ can be un-
derstood in a scenario where the metal-rich (i.e.
[Fe/H](cid:38) −1 dex) RR Lyrae component is related
to the thick disc : indeed, as discussed in the previ-
ous point, the peanut-shaped morphology of thick
disc stars appears only at large heights above the
plane, and is not present at low latitudes, where
not even the more metal-rich components of the
bulge (A and B) show any split.

4 CONCLUSIONS

To understand the properties of the Galactic bulge and
the way these properties change with metallicity, we
need to place this structure in its environment, that
is the Galactic stellar disc, and take into account the
most recent ﬁndings about the latter. The stellar disc is
vertically structured, with an α−enhanced, metal-poor
and kinematically warm disc (the so-called thick disc)
at least as massive as the thin counterpart, and mostly
concentrated in the inner regions of the Galaxy. The disc
is also radially structured, with chemical patterns that
diﬀer in the inner (R (cid:46) 6 kpc) and outer (R (cid:38) 10 kpc)
regions. When this radial and vertical structuring are
taken into account, the chemical similarity between the
bulge and the disc becomes evident, and little room is
left for the presence of any classical spheroid. N-body
modeling aiming at understanding and explaining the
chemo-kinematic and morphological properties of the
diﬀerent bulge components need to implement the new
vision we have acquired of the Galactic disc(s) popula-
tions. First results about the modeling of a composite
disc galaxy and its mapping into the bulge are presented
and support the hypothesis of a pure (thin+thick) disc
scenario for the origin of the vast majority (i.e. for stars
with [Fe/H](cid:38) −1 dex) of the Milky Way bulge.
