The possibility that certain fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can support non-Abelian
anyons, which transform according to a non-Abelian representation of the braid group, has caused
tremendous excitement in recent years. We make a strong theoretical case that a recently observed
FQH state at ﬁlling factor ν = 1/2 in bilayer graphene [Kim et al. Nano Lett. 15, 7445 (2015)]
represents a new class of FQH state with fractionally charged non-Abelian excitations. We identify
its physical origin, provide an explicit microscopic wave function for it, carry out extensive numerical
tests, and list experimental signatures that diﬀerentiate it from other candidate non-Abelian FQH
states. We further predict a topological quantum phase transition between two non-Abelian FQH
states at ﬁlling factors ν = −3/2 and 5/2 in bilayer graphene. We suggest that multilayer graphene
can serve as a unique platform for the realization of many more non-Abelian FQH states.

The discovery of quantum Hall eﬀect1,2 marked the
genesis of topological phases in modern condensed mat-
ter physics. To date, the GaAs quantum wells with
high mobility have produced the most extensive FQH
states. The vast majority of them occur at ﬁlling fac-
tors with odd denominators, and can be explained as
integer quantum Hall (IQH) states of topological parti-
cles called composite fermions3. An even denominator
FQH state was observed by Willett et al.4 at ﬁlling fac-
tor ν = 5/2, which is believed to be described by the
Moore-Read Pfaﬃan wave function5 or its particle-hole
conjugate called the anti-Pfaﬃan6,7. These represent a
topological (chiral p-wave) superconductor of composite
fermions and support fractionally charged Majorana zero
modes exhibiting non-Abelian braid statistics8. The pos-
sible application of non-Abelian anyons in topological
quantum computation9,10 has inspired many works, in-
cluding the search for Majorana zero modes in a variety
of physical systems11–13. In spite of much experimental
eﬀort14–18, the non-Abelian nature of the ν = 5/2 state
has not yet been demonstrated conclusively.

The atomically thin graphene provides another invalu-
able system for studying quantum Hall physics. In con-
trast to GaAs quantum wells that are buried deep below
the sample surface, graphene is accessible to direct exper-
imental probes, such as scanning tunneling microscope,
which could possibly enable a manipulation of quasipar-
ticles of FQH states to reveal and perhaps utilize their
exotic braid properties. A plethora of FQH states have
already been observed in monolayer graphene19–22, which
manifest diﬀerent patterns due to the breaking of the
SU(4) spin-valley symmetry, but all of them have odd
denominators and can be modeled as IQH of composite
fermions with spin and valley indices23. The absence of
even denominator states is anticipated by theoretical cal-
culations24,25, which have shown that composite fermions
form Fermi sea rather than a paired state at half ﬁlling
of any Landau level (LL) in monolayer graphene. This
situation recently changed dramatically due to the ob-
servation of FQH states at ν = −1/226 and ν = 1/227 in
bilayer graphene. The former has been proposed to be of

the Pfaﬃan or anti-Pfaﬃan type28 analogous to the 5/2
state in GaAs, but the physical origin of the latter has
remained a puzzle and is the topic of this article.

In this paper, we propose that the ν = 1/2 state in
bilayer graphene signiﬁes the realization of a new kind
of FQH state, namely the Jain 221 parton state29,30,
which also supports fractionally charged excitations with
non-Abelian braid statistics31. This FQH state has not
been found to be stabilized by any of the physically rele-
vant Hamiltonians in previous experimental and numeri-
cal works. However, we show that the existence of nearly
degenerate LLs with diﬀerent orbital indices in multi-
layer graphene produces favorable conditions for gener-
ating this state. We present numerical calculations to
show that the Jain 221 parton state is the exact ground
state of a model with short-range interaction, and a vi-
able candidate for Coulomb interaction in bilayer and
trilayer graphene for a broad range of splittings between
the nearly degenerate LLs. We stress a unique feature
of this state: It owes its existence fundamentally to LL
mixing and disappears when LL mixing vanishes in the
limit of large splitting. (LL mixing is believed to break
the tie between the Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states32,33,
but they occur even without LL mixing.) We discuss its
properties that can be used to distinguish it from the
Pfaﬃan and anti-Pfaﬃan states in future experiments.
Our study brings out the exciting possibility that mul-
tilayer graphene can produce many more non-Abelian
FQH states.

The low-energy physics of Bernel stacked bilayer
graphene and ABC stacked trilayer graphene can be
approximately described by chiral fermion models34,35.

The solutions of (1) can be expressed using those of the

neglected in most cases).

Taking into account the spin and valley degrees of free-
dom, there are 4J zero energy states which spans the ﬁll-
ing factor range ν = −2J to 2J. For neutral bilayer and
trilayer graphene at ﬁlling factor 0, half of these zero en-
ergy states are occupied, which we expect to be two sub-
sets with the same spin and valley indices because this
quantum Hall spin-valley ferromagnet can eﬃciently min-
imize the exchange correlation energy. The FQH states
in the interval J > ν > 0 are likely to be spin- and valley-
polarized so we shall focus on a set of non-relativistic LLs
with orbital indices N = 0··· , J−1. The degeneracy be-
tween these LLs is by no means perfect and can be lifted
(e.g. by applying a transverse electric ﬁeld27,36,37). The
splitting between them could serve as an additional tun-
able parameter that may help to realize some FQH states.
In what follows we choose the single-particle Hamilto-
nian H0 to describe electrons in N = 0··· , J − 1 non-
relativistic LLs separated by a cylcotron energy gap ωc.

It has been pointed out that screening of the Coulomb
interaction in bilayer graphene (due to virtual transitions
between the zero energy single-particle states and other
ones) is diﬀerent from GaAs and monolayer graphene38.
We shall not attempt to model this eﬀect very accurately
but simply note that screening generally makes the in-
teraction potential more short-ranged. Another possible

2

way to increase the short-range part of the interaction po-
tential is putting a dielectric plate on top of graphene28.
In our calculations presented below, we will ﬁrst use bare
Coulomb potential VCoul(rj − rk) = e2/(ε|rj − rk|) (ε is
the dielectric constant of the system) and then modify
it by increasing the short-range part. The coeﬃcients

{αi} are given explicitly in Appendix A for the cases of

our interest.

In the studies of FQH states, a crucial role is played
by explicit wave functions, which clarify the physics and
can be tested against exact eigenstates of certain Hamil-
tonians in ﬁnite-size systems. In the parton construction
of FQH states29,30, one divides an electron into ﬁctitious
fractionally charged particles called partons, places each
species of partons in an incompressible IQH state, and
then reassembles the partons to obtain an electron state.
The number of species of partons has to be an odd integer
to ensure that the Pauli principle is satisﬁed. If the IQH
state at ﬁlling factor ν is denoted χν, then the general
j χνj . Its ﬁlling fac-
]−1 and the charge of the parton with
ﬁlling factor νj is ej = eν/νj. While all the composite
fermion FQH states can be obtained within the parton
construction, not all parton FQH states admit interpre-
tation in terms of composite fermions. The state relevant
to this work is the Jain 221 state at ﬁlling factor ν = 1/2,

which does not belong to the composite fermion class.

By inspection, we can construct a Hamiltonian for
which this state is the exact zero energy ground state.
The maximal power of the anti-holomorphic coordinate

¯z is two in Ψpart
the zeroth, ﬁrst and second non-relativistic LLs when ex-
panded in terms of the Slater determinants. Let us con-
sider a model in which these three LLs are degenerate at
an energy that we deﬁne to be zero, and send all other
LLs to inﬁnity. The 221 wave function then has zero
221 ({r}) van-
kinetic energy. Furthermore, given that Ψpart
ishes as |r|3 when two electrons are brought close to one
another, it has zero energy with respect to the Trugman-
Kivelson interaction39

where the scale is chosen so that the ﬁrst Haldane pseu-
dopotential40 in the lowest LL is 1 in the disk geometry.
(The interaction may seem somewhat strange, but its
matrix elements can be evaluated with the help of inte-
221 ({r})
gration by parts.) In fact, one can show that Ψpart
is the highest density zero energy state of this model, as
conﬁrmed in explicit numerical calculations below, be-
cause other zero energy states at ν = 1/2 necessarily
occupy yet higher LLs and are thus not allowed. We em-
phasize that this conclusion, while derived here using the
wave function in the symmetric gauge on disk geometry,
is also valid for other choices of gauge and geometry.

There is another U (1) gauge freedom related to phase

The parton construction also suggests a topological
ﬁeld theory for this state31. The three parton ﬁelds are

charge eI = e/4 and the third one has charge eII = e/2.
The ﬁrst two parton ﬁelds have an SU (2) gauge freedom

denoted as (cid:101)ψI+, (cid:101)ψI− and (cid:101)ψII, where the ﬁrst two have

This Lagrangian density supplemented with other pos-
sible large gauge transformations that leave the system
invariant provides a complete eﬀective theory of the 221
parton state. The last term of Eq. 8 is a SU (2)2 Chern-
Simons term, which implies that the elementary excita-
tions of this state are Ising type anyons41.

The essential idea now is as follows. Let us begin with
the model described above with J = 3 and ωc = 0 (i.e.
three degenerate LLs with orbital indices N = 0, 1 and
2) and choose the interaction potential to be V1. The
221 ({r}) state is the exact zero energy ground state in
Ψpart
this case. The question then is: To what extent does this
FQH state survive (i.e.
the gap does not close) when
we split the degeneracy between the LLs and vary the
interaction towards the Coulomb interaction? To ad-
dress this question we perform numerical calculations us-
ing the spherical geometry40, in which Ne electrons move
on the surface of a sphere with a total of Nφ ﬂux quanta
(one ﬂux quantum is φ0 = hc/e) passing through it42,43.
The total angular momentum L and its z component Lz
are good quantum numbers. The incompressible state
221 ({r}) must manifest as a uniform L = 0 state at
Ψpart
Nφ = 2Ne − 5. It is customary in the studies of FQH
states to restrict the Hilbert space to a speciﬁc LL, but
we must keep two or three LLs because the 221 state is
not viable within the N = 0 LL, where the ground state
at Nφ = 2Ne − 5 has L(cid:54)=0. In other words, there is a gap
closing transition as the splitting between the three LLs
is increased to inﬁnity.

We ﬁrst study the Hamiltonian H0 + V1 with J = 3
at ωc = 0. For the cases with Ne = 6, 8 and Nφ =
2Ne−5, it is conﬁrmed that there is a unique zero energy
state on sphere. By adding one more ﬂux, we create
an excitation with a total charge of e/2. One expects
the additional ﬂux to be accommodated into one of the

χ2 factors, as conﬁrmed in numerical calculations by an
inspection of the number of zero energy states and their
quantum numbers. Because the addition of one ﬂux to χ2
produces two quasiholes, it follows that the local charge
of a single quasihole of the 221 parton state is e∗ = e/4.
For the Hamiltonian with Coulomb interaction H0 +
VCoul, we have studied bilayer graphene with Ne =
6, 8, 10, 12 and trilayer graphene with Ne = 6, 8 at Nφ =
2Ne − 5 for a range of LL splitting ωc (there are two
energy splittings in trilayer graphene, which we take to
be equal for simplicity). All energies are quoted in units
of e2/ε(cid:96)B, which is on the order of several hundred K
for typical parameters in graphene. The precise value of
ωc is not presently known. The diﬀerence between the
lowest and the ﬁrst excited eigenvalues in a spectrum
is deﬁned as its energy gap ∆, which gets contributions
from both the kinetic and the interaction energies. Fig. 1
shows for the systems with Ne = 8 the gap as well as
221 ({r}) (it is pro-
the overlap between the trial state Ψpart
jected to the ﬁrst two LLs for bilayer graphene, while no
projection is needed for trilayer graphene) and the exact

large, especially in view of the Hilbert space dimensions
(the L = 0 subspace has 418 states in bilayer graphene
and 18212 states in trilayer graphene), thus demonstrat-
ing that the 221 trial state is a valid representation of
the exact ground state for a certain range of ωc. The
exact ground state does not have L = 0 for suﬃciently
large ωc (beyond ωc ≈ 1.30 in both bilayer and trilayer
graphene) due to a transition into the compressible com-
posite fermion Fermi liquid state44. This underscores
the essential role of LL mixing for the occurrence of the
221 ({r}) state. The system with (Ne, Nφ) = (10, 15)
Ψpart
has a robust gap, but it aliases with the standard 2/3
FQH state and is therefore not useful for our purpose.
For the (Ne, Nφ) = (12, 19) system, we are not able
to directly compute the two lowest energy states in the
Lz = 0 subspace (which is technically challenging due to
the large Hilbert space dimension of 241564622), but we
have computed the lowest energy states in the Lz = 0
and 1 subspaces. The ground state in the Lz = 0 sec-
tor has an energy lower by 0.0265, which means that the
ground state has L = 0. We also study the eﬀect of
adding a short-range V1 component to the bare Coulomb
potential. The inset of panel (b) in Fig. 1 shows the
overlap of the trial state Ψ221({r}) and the exact ground
state of the Hamiltonian H0 + VCoul + 0.2V1, which con-
ﬁrms the expectation that increasing the strength of the
short-range part of the interaction results in higher over-
laps. We believe that these studies make a strong case
for the existence of Jain 221 parton state at ν = 1/2
in bilayer and trilayer graphene for a sizable range of pa-
rameters. This analysis is also applicable to ﬁlling factors
−7/2, −3/2, 5/2 in bilayer graphene and −11/2, −5/2,
7/2 in trilayer graphene, where one or more sets of the
N = 0,··· , J − 1 LLs are expected to form a spin-valley
ferromagnet and the additional 1/2 ﬁlled states partially
occupy one set of N = 0,··· , J − 1 LLs as described by
our model.

Besides the 221 state, the other two possible candidates
are the Moore-Read Pfaﬃan state and its hole partner
known as the anti-Pfaﬃan state5–7, which have been dis-
cussed extensively in the context of the 5/2 FQH states
in GaAs systems4.
It is worth pointing out that there
221 ({r})
is no “anti-221” state at ν = 1/2 because Ψpart
is not conﬁned to a single LL. The Pfaﬃan state given
by ΨPf ({r}) = Pf
j>k=1 (zj − zk)2 occurs at
Nφ = 2Ne − 3 whereas the anti-Pfaﬃan state occurs at
Nφ = 2Ne + 1. The diﬀerent shifts of Pfaﬃan, anti-
Pfaﬃan, and 221 parton states indicate their topological
distinction. We have investigated the possibility for the
Pfaﬃan or anti-Pfaﬃan states to be realized at ν = 1/2
in bilayer and trilayer graphene described by the Hamil-
tonian H0 + VCoul with ωc = 0. The ground states of the
Ne = 8, 10 systems in bilayer graphene and the Ne = 8
system in trilayer graphene at Nφ = 2Ne − 3 have L (cid:54)= 0,
which eliminates the Pfaﬃan state. The ground state
of the (Ne, Nφ) = (8, 17) system in bilayer graphene has
L = 0, but the energy gap is 0.0056 and the overlap with

4

the anti-Pfaﬃan state is 0.5820, which suggests that the
anti-Pfaﬃan state is less favored than the 221 parton
state. The next system for testing the anti-Pfaﬃan state
at (Ne, Nφ) = (10, 21) aliases with the 2/5 composite
fermion state and therefore does not provide useful in-
formation.

We predict the exciting possibility of a topologi-
cal quantum phase transition between two non-Abelian
states, namely the 221 and the Pfaﬃan or anti-Pfaﬃan,
at ﬁlling factors ν = −3/2 and 5/2 in bilayer graphene.
This relies on the fact that in the ﬁlling factor ranges
−2 < ν < 0 and 2 < ν < 4, the orbital order can be re-
versed by applying a transverse electric ﬁeld to make the
N = 1 LL to cross below the N = 0 LL27,36. This means
that both positive and negative values of ωc are physical
at ν = −3/2 and 5/2. As shown in Fig. 1, for negative
221 ({r}) and the
ωc the overlap between the trial state Ψpart
exact ground state goes down sharply as ωc decreases
below a critical negative value, and then remains nearly
zero (smaller than 0.01). In contrast, the energy gap ﬁrst
decreases and then increases as ωc becomes more nega-
tive. This can be understood as a transition from the 221
parton state into the Pfaﬃan state, the latter occurring
when most electrons predominantly occupy the N = 1
LL for suﬃciently negative ωc. The Pfaﬃan state given
above is written as a N = 0 LL wave function, but we
can straightforwardly translate it into a state deﬁned in
the N = 1 LL. Its overlap with the exact ground state
becomes quite large in the region where the gap is in-
creasing as ωc becomes more negative. This points to
the possibility of a topological quantum phase transition
as a function of ωc. For completeness, we have also stud-
ied trilayer graphene in the negative ωc regime where the
N = 2 LL is at the bottom. The ground state ceases
to be incompressible for ωc < −0.10, which is consistent
with the absence of incompressible state at the half ﬁlled
N = 2 LL.
It is interesting to ask if the 221 parton state could also
be relevant for the ν = −1/2 state in bilayer graphene.
This system can be mapped to a ﬁlling factor −1/2 −
(−2) = 3/2 in the doublet of N = 0 and N = 1 LLs.
If the electrons almost fully occupy the N = 0 LL, then
the N = 1 LL is nearly half ﬁlled and one may expect
the physics to be the same as that of the 5/2 state in
GaAs28. However, if one introduces a negative ωc to
attract more electrons into the N = 1 LL, it is possible
for the holes of this system to form a 221 parton state. We
have tested this possibility and found that the (Ne, Nφ) =
(18, 11) system has a uniform ground state with L = 0
and a non-zero gap for −0.85 ≤ ωc ≤ −0.20, but the
overlap between the 221 parton state of holes and the
exact ground state is very low, less than 0.15, so the
physics in this regime remains unclear.

We next discuss how the Pfaﬃan, the anti-Pfaﬃan,
and the 221 parton states can be distinguished exper-
imentally. The local charge of the elementary excita-
tions is e∗ = e/4 for all three states. A dimension-
less interaction parameter g can be extracted from the

5

temperature dependence of quasiparticle tunneling into
edge states14. The Pfaﬃan state predicts g = 1/4
while the anti-Pfaﬃan and the 221 parton states yield
g = 1/214,45,46. For an ideal edge without reconstruc-
tion, the anti-Pfaﬃan state is expected to have backward-
moving edge modes6,7 whereas the Pfaﬃan and the 221
parton states are not, which can be probed in shot noise
and local thermometry measurements47,48. In principle,
a combination of these three experiments can help to
identify the nature of the experimentally observed state.
In summary, we have made a convincing case that the
221 parton state can occur for appropriate parameters
in bilayer and trilayer graphene.
It is natural to iden-
tify it with the observed ν = 1/2 FQH state in bilayer
graphene27 and possibly in trilayer graphene (where pre-
liminary evidence for a ν = 1/2 FQH state has been
reported49). Looking ahead, multilayer graphene has the
potential to host other Jain rst parton states of the form
rst ({r}) = χr({r})χs({r})χt({r}). For example, the
Ψpart

one with r = 3, s = 3, t = 1 has ﬁlling factor 3/5 and the
one with r = 2, s = 2, t = 2 has ﬁlling factor 2/3. They
are distinct from the standard lowest LL states at these
ﬁlling factors, as they occur at diﬀerent shifts and pos-
sess non-Abelian excitations31. The possible realization
of these states would open the door to studying topo-
logical quantum phase transitions between non-Abelian
and Abelian FQH states as a function of the LL splitting,
which can be tuned by applying a transverse electric ﬁeld.
The unique LL structure of multilayer graphene thus of-
fers the promise of many new fascinating states and phe-
nomena.

To be consistent with most works in the literature, we deﬁne half of the ﬂux through the sphere as Q = Nφ/2. The

wave functions on sphere are

where l = Q+N (N is the Landau level index) is the angular momentum, α is the z component of angular momentum,
θ and φ are the azimuthal and radial angles, and u = cos(θ/2)eiφ/2, v = sin(θ/2)e−iφ/2 are the spinor coordinates.
