FR´ECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR

DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS II. THE URSELL FUNCTION

MARTIN HANKE∗

Abstract. For a grand canonical ensemble of classical point-like particles at equilibrium in
continuous space we investigate the functional relationship between a stable and regular pair poten-
tial describing the interaction of the particles and the thermodynamical limit of the Ursell or pair
correlation function. For certain admissible perturbations of the pair potential and suﬃciently small
activity we rigorously establish Frechet diﬀerentiability of the Ursell function in the L1 norm.

Furthermore, concerning the thermodynamical limit of the pair distribution function we explicitly

compute its Fr´echet derivative as a sum of a multiplication operator and an integral operator.

Key words. Statistical mechanics, cluster expansion, molecular distribution function, Ursell

function, radial distribution function, Fr´echet derivative

1. Introduction. We study a continuous system of identical classical particles
in a grand canonical ensemble, where the potential energy is determined by a pair
potential which only depends on the distance of the interacting particles. In the ﬁrst
part of this work [3] we have shown that in the thermodynamical limit the corre-
sponding equilibrium molecular distribution functions are diﬀerentiable in L∞ with
respect to the pair potential.
It is well-known, however, that the correlations be-
tween individual observations of particles become small as the distance between the
observation points gets large. For example, the so-called pair correlation function or
(second order) Ursell function, which describes the correlations between the occur-
rence of particles at two diﬀerent points in space is known to be close to zero (no
correlation) for distant points, and the rate of decay is strong enough to guarantee
that the thermodynamical limit of the pair correlation function is integrable over the
entire space. We mention in passing that the pair correlation function is important for
physical chemistry applications (cf., e.g., R¨uhle et al. [9]) because this is a measurable
structural quantity that gives insight into the type of underlying potential.

One may question whether the Fr´echet derivative of the pair correlation function
(with respect to the potential) maps also continuously into the space of integrable
functions; this does not follow from the L∞ analysis of the ﬁrst part of this work and,
in fact, it does not seem possible to prove this with the techniques utilized in [3]. We
therefore use a diﬀerent argument in this paper based on cluster expansions of the
Ursell functions.

The same approach is subsequently used to derive integral operator represen-
tations of the Fr´echet derivatives of the thermodynamical limits of the singlet and
pair molecular distribution functions, which can easily be reassembled to obtain the
derivative of the pair correlation function, when necessary. Among other applications
such a representation may open a door to investigate invertibility of these derivatives.
In the following section we state the
basic assumptions on the pair potential and its perturbations, and brieﬂy review the
main results from [3]. Then, in Section 3 we summarize classical results about cluster

The outline of this paper is as follows.

expansions of grand canonical quantities such as the molecular distribution functions
and the Ursell functions; here we also recollect basic properties of the pair correlation
function, such as integrability and asymptotic behavior at inﬁnity. Section 4 is devoted
to upper bounds for certain higher order correlation functions; this section can be
skipped by readers who are only interested in our main result on diﬀerentiability,
stated and proved in Section 5 (Theorem 5.3). The estimates from Section 4 are
revisited in Section 6, where they are utilized to justify the explicit computation
of the thermodynamical limit representation of the Fr´echet derivative of the pair
distribution function.

2. Background. Let Λ ⊂ R3 be a bounded cubical box centered at the origin,
and Ri ∈ Λ, i = 1, 2, . . . , be the coordinates of the individual particles of a grand
canonical ensemble in Λ. Repeatedly we use the notation

RN = (R1, . . . , RN )

and

Rn,N = (Rn+1, . . . , RN )

for the coordinates of (some of) the particles of the entire ensemble. When the system
is in thermal equilibrium the m particle distribution function given by

ρ(m)
Λ (Rm) =

ΞΛ

∞XN =m

zN

(N − m)!ZΛN −m

e−βUN (RN ) dRm,N

(2.1)

describes – up to proper normalization – the probability density of observing m par-
ticles simultaneously at the coordinates R1, R2, . . . , Rm ∈ Λ. In (2.1)

UN (R1, . . . , RN ) = X1≤i<j≤N

u(|Ri − Rj|)

(2.2)

is the potential energy of a conﬁguration of an N particle system, assuming that the
interactions between the particles can be described by a pair potential and that these
interactions only depend on their mutual distances. Furthermore, in (2.1) β > 0 is
the inverse temperature, z > 0 is the activity, and

ΞΛ =

∞XN =0

zN

N ! ZΛN

e−βUN (RN ) dRN

(2.3)

is the associated grand canonical partition function.

Following [3] we declare the pair potential u : R+ → R to satisfy the following

assumption.

Assumption A. There exists s > 0 and positive decreasing functions u∗, u∗ :

R+ → R with

Z s

0

u∗(r) r2 dr = ∞

and

Z ∞

s

u∗(r) r2 dr < ∞ ,

such that u satisﬁes

u(r) ≥ u∗(r) , r ≤ s ,

and

|u(r)| ≤ u∗(r) , r ≥ s .

We also introduce the Banach space Vu of perturbations of u as the set of functions

v for which the corresponding norm

kvkVu = max{ kv/uk(0,s), kv/u∗k(s,∞) }

(2.4)

FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

is ﬁnite∗. With these prerequisites it has been shown in [3] that for any 0 < t0 < 1 the

following three properties hold true for all perturbed potentials eu = u+v with v ∈ Vu,

kvkVu ≤ t0, the respective quantities being independent of the particular choice of v:

(i) there exists B > 0 such that

X1≤i<j≤Neu(|Ri − Rj|) ≥ −BN

(ii) for every m ∈ N and Rm ∈ Λm there exists an index j∗(Rm) such that

for every conﬁguration of N particles and every N ∈ N, i.e., eu is stable;

mXi=1
i6=j∗ eu(|Ri − Rj∗ |) ≥ −2B

with the same constant B as in (2.5);

(iii) there exists cβ > 0 with

(2.5)

(2.6)

4πZ ∞

0

|e−β eu(r) − 1| r2 dr ≤ cβ ,

(2.7)

i.e., eu is regular.

As a consequence it follows from classical results by Ruelle [11] that for any of these
Λ , m ∈ N, converge

potentials the associated molecular distribution functions eρ(m)
compactly to a bounded limiting function eρ(m) as the size of Λ grows to inﬁnity,

provided that the activity is suﬃciently small, i.e., that

0 < z <

1

cβe2βB+1 .

(2.8)

This is known as the thermodynamical limit.

In [3] it has further been shown that the molecular distribution functions ρ(m)

as

Λ

well as their thermodynamical limits have Fr´echet derivatives

∂ρ(m)

Λ ∈ L (Vu, L ∞(Λm))

and

∂ρ(m) ∈ L (Vu, L ∞((R3)m))

with respect to u, and for a given v ∈ Vu the directional derivatives(cid:0)∂ρ(m)
compactly to (cid:0)∂ρ(m))v in the thermodynamical limit, uniformly for kvkVu ≤ 1.

In this paper we focus on the pair correlation function

In the thermodynamical limit the pair correlation function converges (compactly) to
a function ω(2) that only depends on |R2 − R1|, and which is related to the so called
radial distribution function g via

From our aforementioned results it follows that ω(2)(R, 0) as a function of R ∈ R3
is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable in L (Vu, L∞(R3)). However, this function is also known to
belong to L1(R3), cf. [11], and to converge to zero for |R| → ∞ under mild additional
assumptions on u, cf. [7, 1, 2, 8] and Section 3 below. This decay at inﬁnity is not
taken into account when studying the distribution functions in L∞ as has been done
in [3]; therefore the purpose of this paper is to extend our results and to prove that
ω(2)( · , 0) has a Fr´echet derivative ∂ω(2) ∈ L (Vu, L1(R3)).

Our method of proof utilizes classical graph theoretical cluster expansions that
have been developed in the aforementioned papers to derive appropriate bounds for
the pair correlation function. We will summarize the corresponding ingredients in the
following section.

3. Cluster expansions. A graph G is a set of (undirected) bonds (i, j) between
labeled vertices, where (i, j) ∈ G means that there is a bond connecting vertices #i
and #j. In our applications vertex #i corresponds to the ith particle of the grand
canonical ensemble and its coordinates Ri ∈ Λ; a bond (i, j) ∈ G is associated with a
certain interaction of the corresponding two particles, either given by

where

fij = f (Ri − Rj) ,

Ri, Rj ∈ R3 ,

f (R) = e−βu(|R|) − 1

(3.1)

(3.2)

is the so-called Mayer f -function, or by the absolute values of fij. We refer to Stell [12]
as a general reference and for a detailed exposition of graph theory in statistical
mechanics.

For our results three types of graphs are relevant. First comes the set of connected
in a connected graph every pair of vertices has a connecting path of bonds

graphs:

where the sum varies over all connected graphs CN with N vertices labeled #1 through
#N . The second Ursell function has already been introduced in (2.9) and the ﬁrst
one can be shown to coincide with ρ(1)

we need later on are

This last representation may not be the simplest one, but it is the one that we will
exploit below.

To introduce a second set of graphs let I, J ⊂ N be two disjoint ﬁnite sets of
vertex labels with cardinalities |I| ≥ 1 and |J | ≥ 0. We deﬁne ZI,J as the set of
graphs with vertices given by I ∪ J , out of which those in I are “highlighted” – being
white as opposed to black, say – and where each black vertex has a connecting path
of bonds to one of the white vertices. These graphs occur in the expansion

Λ (Rm) =

∞XN =m

zN

(N − m)! XZN,m

ZΛN −m(cid:16) Y(i,j)∈ZN,m

fij(cid:17) dRm,N

(3.6)

of the molecular distribution functions, where ZN,m varies over all graphs in ZIm,Jm,N
with Im = {1, . . . , m} and Jm,N = {m + 1, . . . , N }.

A special case of the latter graphs are trees and forests. A tree is a connected
graph with a single white vertex, its root, such that between each pair of vertices
there is one and only one connecting path. A union of trees is a forest; the set of
forests whose constituent trees have the same roots I and the same black vertices J
is denoted by FI,J ⊂ ZI,J .

Concerning trees we quote the following well-known result (for a proof, cf., e.g.,

Penrose [7]), which will be referred to later on:

Lemma 3.1. Let u be a stable and regular pair potential and denote by TN the
set of trees with N vertices labeled #1 through #N . If z satisﬁes (2.8) then the series

M. HANKE

For later convenience we list a few properties of the function G.
Proposition 3.2. Let the assumptions of Lemma 3.1 be satisﬁed. Then the
function G of (3.10) is nonnegative, even, bounded, and integrable. Moreover, if
u(r) → 0 as r → ∞ (e.,g., when u satisﬁes Assumption A) then G(R) → 0 for
|R| → ∞.

Proof. According fo Lemma 3.1 G majorizes the nonnegative function τ (2), hence

G is nonnegative and even by virtue of (3.10).

Since |f | is bounded by e2βB and belongs to L1(R), cf. (2.5) and (2.7), respectively,

it follows that f ∈ L2(R3), and then c|f | ∈ L2(R3), too. Therefore, rewriting (3.10) as

bG = w2 c|f | +

2

w3

1 − wc|f | c|f |

we conclude that the second term on the right-hand side belongs to L1(R3) because
its numerator is bounded away from zero according to (3.8), and taking the inverse
Fourier transform we obtain

G − w2|f | ∈ C0 .

From this it follows that G is bounded, and if u vanishes at inﬁnity then so does G.

Finally, it follows from (3.10) and the nonnegativity of G that

ZR3(cid:12)(cid:12)G(R)(cid:12)(cid:12) dR = bG(0) =

w2 c|f |(0)
1 − wc|f |(0)

< ∞ ,

i.e., G ∈ L1(R3).

Let I, J ⊂ N with I ∩ J = ∅ be given; furthermore, denote by RI and RJ
the coordinates of the particles with labels in I and J , respectively. Ruelle [10, 11]
considered the functions

ϕI,J (RI ; RJ ) = XZI,J

fij(cid:17) ,
(cid:16) Y(i,j)∈ZI,J

(3.11)

where ZI,J varies over all graphs in ZI,J ; for I = ∅ the deﬁnition (3.11) is set to be
zero because Z∅,J is the empty set. Take note that the order of the particles in I and
J does not aﬀect the value of the right-hand side of (3.11).

Given i∗ = i∗(I, RI) ∈ I, and eliminating vertex #i∗ from all graphs in ZI,J ,

Ruelle derived the recursion

ϕI,J (RI ; RJ ) = dI,i∗ (RI ) XK⊂J

kK(Ri∗ ; RK)ϕI∪K\{i∗},J \K(RI∪K\{i∗}; RJ \K) ,

where

(3.12)

kK(R; RK) = Yj∈K

f (Rj − R) .

(3.13)

FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

We emphasize that the particular elements of the family of ϕ-functions that enter
into this recursion depend on the actual values of the input coordinates RI because
we explicitly allow i∗ to depend on RI ; aside of that the listing of the variables
RI and RJ is redundant here and below, because it’s always the coordinates of
the particles associated with the two indices of ϕ that are used as corresponding
arguments. We therefore simplify our notation and follow [8] by writing ϕ(I; J )
instead of ϕI,J (RI; RJ ) in the remainder of this work; similarly we will write dI,i∗
and kK(Ri∗ ) for the left-hand sides of (3.12) and (3.13), respectively. The above
recursion thus takes the form

ϕ(I; J ) = dI,i∗ XK⊂J

kK(Ri∗ )ϕ(I ∪ K \ {i∗}; J \ K) .

(3.14)

If we select i∗ = j∗(I, RI) ∈ I in accordance with (2.6) in such a way that

Xi∈I
i6=j∗ eu(|Ri − Rj∗ |) ≥ −2B

and by induction Ruelle concluded that

for every eu = u + v with kvkVu ≤ t0 then it follows from (3.14) that
(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕ(I; J )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ e2βB XK⊂J(cid:12)(cid:12)kK(Rj∗ )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕ(I ∪ K \ {j∗}; J \ K)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,
ZΛ|J |(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕ(I; J )(cid:12)(cid:12) dRJ ≤ (|J |)! c|J |
|fij|(cid:17) ,
(cid:16)Y(i,j)∈F
ψ(I; J ) = e2(N −1)βB XF ∈FI,J

Later, Poghosyan and Ueltschi [8] considered the functions

β (cid:0)e2βB+1(cid:1)|I∪J |−1

.

N = |I ∪ J | ,

which satisfy the recursion (3.16) with equality, i.e.,

ψ(I; J ) = e2βB XK⊂J(cid:12)(cid:12)kK(Rj∗ )(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ(I ∪ K \ {j∗}; J \ K) .

From this they readily obtained a so-called tree-graph inequality †, namely

careful initialization of their inductive argument.

sets Z{1},J1,N and F{1},J1,N , respectively, with J1,N = {2, . . . , N }. It therefore follows
from (3.11), (3.20b), and (3.18) that

Since the right-hand side of (3.21) does not depend on Λ we can turn to the thermo-
dynamical limit to conclude that

ω(2)(R, 0) ≤ e−4βBG(R) .

Accordingly,
ω(2)(R, 0) → 0 as |R| → ∞ if u satisﬁes Assumption A.

it follows from Proposition 3.2 that ω(2)( · , 0) ∈ L1(R3), and that

Proof. For a given value of N ≥ 2 we adopt Ruelle’s method mentioned in the

previous section and eliminate vertex #1 from each of the graphs in Z×
identity

ϕ×

N (RN ) = XK⊂J2,N

kK(R1)ϕ(K ∪ {2}; J2,N \ K) .

Note that the corresponding term dI2,1 of (3.14) is missing here because all graphs
in Z×
N lack a connecting edge between vertices #1 and #2. Therefore, (3.20a) and
(3.19) yield

N (RN )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ XK⊂J2,N(cid:12)(cid:12)kK(R1)(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ(K ∪ {2}; J2,N \ K) = e−2βBψ(I2; J2,N ) ,

The forests that occur in S(3)

consist of all possible combinations of one tree
involving vertices #1 and #3 and another tree rooted in vertex #2; hence, we can
use Lemma 3.1 and classical graph integral calculus, cf. [4, 12] to estimate

Likewise we obtain

Inserting this into (4.6) we thus obtain the assertion.

Next we recall from (3.4) that

χ(3)
Λ (R1, R2, R3) = ω(3)

Λ (R1, R2, R3) + ω(2)

Λ (R1, R3)ρ(1)

Λ (R2) + ω(2)

Λ (R1, R2)ρ(1)

Λ (R3) .

From this and (3.3) we conclude that χ(3)
Λ is a sum over all graphs with N ≥ 3 vertices
and the associated graph integrals over R3,N ∈ ΛN −3, where the graphs are of either
one of the following three types:

(i) a connected graph;
(ii) a graph with two connected components, one of which containing vertex #2

and the other one containing vertices #1 and #3;

10

M. HANKE

(iii) a graph with two connected components, one of which containing vertex #3

and the other one containing vertices #1 and #2.

We use this observation to establish the following result.

Proposition 4.2. If u is a stable and regular pair potential and the activity z

satisﬁes (2.8) then

(cid:12)(cid:12)χ(3)
Λ (R1, R2, R3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ we−4βBe−βu(|R2−R3|)(cid:0)G(R2 − R1) + G(R3 − R1)(cid:1)

for all R1, R2, R3 ∈ Λ.

Proof. By its deﬁnition ζ(3)(R3, R2, R1) – note the diﬀerent ordering of the ar-
guments – is the sum over all graphs with N ≥ 3 vertices and the associated graph
integrals over R3,N , where in each graph every vertex is connected to vertex #2 or
to vertex #3, but the latter two vertices have no connecting edge. Adding a bond
between vertices #2 and #3 to any of these graphs therefore results in a connected
graph. Accordingly, any graph occuring in the deﬁnition of ζ(3)(R3, R2, R1) belongs
to the list (i)-(iii) above, and so does its counterpart with the additional bond.

Likewise, if C ∈ CN with N ≥ 3, and if one eliminates the edge between vertices
#2 and #3 when present, then, still, every vertex has a connecting path to vertex #2
or to vertex #3. We therefore conclude that the graphs appearing in (4.1) consist of
all those taken care of in ζ(3)(R3, R2, R1) and their counterparts with an additional
bond between vertices #2 and #3. Thus it follows from the deﬁnition of the graph
integrals and the distributive law that

χ(3)
Λ (R1, R2, R3) = e−βu(|R2−R3|)ζ(3)(R3, R2, R1) .

Now the assertion follows from Lemma 4.1.

Finally we turn to χ(4)

and (4.1) reveals that

Λ of (4.2). A straightforward computation based on (3.5)

χ(4)
Λ (R1, R2, R3, R4) = η(R1, R2, R3, R4)

+ χ(3)

Λ (R1, R3, R4)ρ(1)

Λ (R2) + χ(3)

Λ (R2, R3, R4)ρ(1)

Λ (R1) ,

(4.7)

where

η(R1, R2, R3, R4) = ω(4)

Λ (R1, R2, R3, R4) + ω(3)
Λ (R2, R3) + ω(2)

Λ (R1, R2, R3)ρ(1)
Λ (R1, R3)ω(2)

Λ (R4)

+ ω(2)

+ ω(3)

Λ (R1, R4)ω(2)
Λ (R1, R2, R4)ρ(1)

Λ (R3) .

As above we observe that η is the sum of all graph integrals that correspond to
connected graphs with N ≥ 4 vertices having a connecting edge between vertices #3
and #4, and their counterparts which are obtained when deleting this very edge. The
latter ones are the graphs from ∪N ≥4Z×
N – up to the labeling of the two white vertices;
therefore it follows as above that

η(R1, R2, R3, R4) = e−βu(|R3−R4|)ζ(4)(R3, R4, R1, R2) .

(4.8)

Proposition 4.3. If u is a stable and regular pair potential and the activity z

satisﬁes (2.8) then there exists C > 0 independent of the size of Λ, such that

for all R1, R2, R3, R4 ∈ Λ.

where the inner sum varies over all those forests Fl ∈ FI2,J2,N , for which in case of
l = 1: vertex #3 belongs to the tree rooted in vertex #1, and vertex #4 does not;
l = 2: vertex #4 belongs to the tree rooted in vertex #1, and vertex #3 does not;
l = 3: vertex #3 and #4 belong to the same tree rooted in vertex #1;
l = 4: vertex #3 and #4 belong to the same tree rooted in vertex #2.

Standard graph analysis and Lemma 3.1 immediately lead to bounds for the ﬁrst two
cases, namely

S(4)
1 ≤ G(R1 − R3)G(R2 − R4) ,

S(4)
2 ≤ G(R1 − R4)G(R2 − R3) .

Concerning S(4)

3 we ﬁrst consider those forests (in S(4)

31 , say) where the connecting
path between vertices #1 and #4 passes through vertex #3, and the remaining forests
(in S(4)
32 ) where the path between vertices #1 to #3 passes through vertex #4. In the
ﬁrst case the trees rooted in vertex #1 can be constructed by glueing together a tree
rooted in vertex #1 and containing vertex #3 and a second tree rooted in vertex #3
and containing vertex #4; this yields the bound

S(4)
31 ≤

w

ze2βB G(R1 − R3)G(R3 − R4) ,

where the numerator is due to the fact that vertex #3 is a joint vertex of the two
trees that are glued together, and the extra factor w stems from the tree rooted in
vertex #2.

Likewise, we obtain corresponding bounds for S(4)

32 and S(4)

4 , namely

S(4)
32 ≤

w

ze2βB G(R1 − R4)G(R3 − R4)

and

S(4)
4 ≤

w

ze2βB (cid:0)G(R2 − R3) + G(R2 − R4)(cid:1)G(R3 − R4) .

Since G is bounded, cf. Proposition 3.2, we ﬁnally obtain by inserting all these bounds
into (4.10) that

(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ(4)(R1, R2, R3, R4)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C(cid:0)G(R1 − R3) + G(R2 − R3) + G(R1 − R4) + G(R2 − R4)(cid:1) .

Together with (4.8) this yields

(cid:12)(cid:12)η(R1, R2, R3, R4)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Ce−βu(|R3−R4|)

2Xi=1

4Xj=3

From Proposition 4.2 it follows that a similar inequality (with a diﬀerent constant)
holds true for the last two terms of (4.7) either, hence the proof is done.

satisﬁes Assumption A, where v ∈ Vu with kvkVu ≤ t0/2 is kept ﬁxed. Associated
with u and two ﬁnite index sets I and J with I ∩ J = ∅ are the Ruelle functions

out this section we consider perturbations eu = u + v of a given potential u that
ϕ(I; J ) of (3.11), and we will associate corresponding Ruelle functions eϕ(I; J ) with
the perturbed potential eu. Later on we also resort to the pair correlation function

Λ corresponding to the grand canonical ensemble with interaction potential eu.
edI,j∗ is the corresponding function associated with eu and if kvkVu ≤ t0/2 then there

We need a few auxiliary estimates from [3]. The ﬁrst one, compare Lemma 3.2 in
[3], concerns the functions dI,j∗ of (3.12) with j∗ = j∗(I, RI ) selected as in (3.15): If

of the fact that the index j∗(I, RI) does not depend on v because of our smallness

assumption, cf. (3.15). Second, for K ⊂ N let kK be given by (3.13) and ekK be the
corresponding function associated with eu. Then, since kvkVu ≤ t0, there exists a

constant Cβ > 0 such that

Now we can estimate the diﬀerence between the Ruelle functions associated with

Lemma 5.1. Under the assumptions of this section let I, J ⊂ N be two ﬁnite

index sets with I 6= ∅ and I ∩ J = ∅. Then there holds

u and eu = u + v.
ZΛ|J |(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)eϕ(I; J ) − ϕ(I; J )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) dRJ

consists of a single element and J = ∅, then

ϕI,J = eϕI,J = 1

FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

13

by virtue of (3.11), and hence the assertion is obviously correct. Note that (5.3) is
also true when I = ∅ and J 6= ∅ is arbitrary; this will be used in the induction step.
Concerning the induction, we use (3.14) with i∗ = j∗(I, RI) of (3.15) for |I ∪J | ≥

2, I 6= ∅, to derive the recursion

∆0ϕ(I; J ) = (edI,j∗ − dI,j∗ ) XK⊂JekK(Rj∗ )eϕ(I ∪ K \ {j∗}; J \ K)

Integrating over RJ and utilizing (5.1a), (5.2a), Ruelle’s estimate (3.17), and the

Under the assumptions of Lemma 5.1 and with the same notation as before we

let

or

|I| = 1, |J | = 0 ,

and for I ∩ J = ∅, |I ∪ J | ≥ 2, |I| 6= 0, and with j∗ = j∗(I, RI) we deﬁne recursively

The constant C only depends on u and on t0, cf. (5.7), but neither on the size of Λ
nor on RI ∈ Λ|I|.

Proof. Again the proof proceeds by induction on |I| + |J |, where for |I| + |J | = 1

there is nothing to prove. Utilizing the notations (5.4) and

∆1ϕ(I; J ) = eϕ(I; J ) − ϕ(I; J ) − ϕ′(I; J )

(5.6)

for the zeroth and ﬁrst order Taylor remainders of ϕ(I; J ) we can use the recursions
(3.14) and (5.5) for N := |I| + |J | − 2 ≥ 0, |I| 6= 0, to obtain

∆1ϕ(I; J ) = (cid:0)edI,j∗ − dI,j∗ − (∂dI,j∗ )v(cid:1) XK⊂J

Integrating over RJ ∈ Λ|J | and using the inequalities (5.1b), (3.17), (5.1a), (5.2a),
(5.3), (5.2b), and the induction hypothesis then we obtain in the same way as in the

Since N + 1 = |I| + |J | − 1 the induction step is complete.

Now we come to the main result of this section.
Theorem 5.3. Let u satisfy Assumption A and z be constrained by (2.8).
Then the thermodynamical limit ω(2)( · , 0) of the corresponding pair correlation func-

tion (2.9) is Fr´echet diﬀerentiable in L(cid:0)Vu, L1(R3)(cid:1).

Proof. From [3] we know that the molecular distribution functions ρ(1)

Λ and ρ(2)
Λ
are Fr´echet diﬀerentiable with respect to L∞(Λ), respectively L∞(Λ2). Hence, the
function

Λ (R1, R2) = ρ(2)

implies Fr´echet diﬀerentiability with the same derivative also in L1(Λ2). For a given

where the constant C′ is ﬁnite because of (2.8) and independent of the size of Λ and

reveals that

(∂ω(2)

Λ )v = ω′

Λ .

From [3] we know that (∂ρ(2)

Λ )v → (∂ρ(1))v compactly
as |Λ| → ∞. The latter is necessarily a constant denoted by (∂ρ0)v in the sequel for
brevity. We also know that ρ(1)

Λ → ρ0 compactly as |Λ| → ∞. It thus follows that

Λ )v → (∂ρ(2))v and (∂ρ(1)

Λ )v(cid:1)(R1, R2) → (cid:0)(∂ρ(2))v(cid:1)(R1, R2) − 2ρ0(∂ρ0)v

|Λ| → ∞ ,

uniformly on bounded subsets of (R3)2, where ∂ω(2) is the Fr´echet derivative of ω(2)
in L (Vu, L∞((R3)2). Choosing any ﬁxed box Λ′ ⊂ Λ we obtain from (5.8) that

and by letting |Λ| → ∞ this implies that

Since the box Λ′ ⊂ R3 can be arbitrarily large we thus have proved that ∂ω(2)( · , 0)

is also the Fr´echet derivative of ω(2)( · , 0) in L(cid:0)Vu, L1(R3)(cid:1).

box Λ ⊂ R3, and with u satisfying Assumption A, the derivatives ∂ρ(m)

Λ of (4.2). We refer to [5] and [3] for physical interpretations of these repre-

The goal of this section is to show that the corresponding formulae for ∂ρ(m),
m = 1, 2, are obtained by integrating over R3 instead, and by dropping all subscripts
Λ, where

χ(3)(R1, R2, R3) = ρ(3)(R1, R2, R3) − ρ(1)(R1)ρ(2)(R2, R3)

and

χ(4)(R1, R2, R3, R4) = ρ(4)(R1, R2, R3, R4) − ρ(2)(R1, R2)ρ(2)(R3, R4) ,

Concerning the veriﬁcation of this assertion for the single integrals appearing in

(6.1) and (6.2) we utilize the following auxiliary result.

Lemma 6.1. Let u satisfy Assumption A, and for some R0 ∈ R3 and C > 0 let

ξΛ : Λ → R be a family of functions with

|ξΛ(R)| ≤ Ce−βu(|R−R0|) ,

R ∈ Λ ,

(6.3)

independent of Λ. Moreover, let ξΛ converge compactly to ξ : R3 → R as |Λ| → ∞.
Then for every v ∈ Vu there holds

ZΛ

v(|R − R0|)ξΛ(R) dR → ZR3

v(|R − R0|)ξ(R) dR

as |Λ| → ∞.

Proof. We extend ξΛ by zero to R3 \ Λ and rewrite

ℓΛ(v) :=ZΛ

v(|R−R0|) ξΛ(R) dR =ZR3

v(|R−R0|)e−βu(|R−R0|)(cid:0)ξΛ(R)eβu(|R−R0|)(cid:1) dR .

By virtue of [3, Lemma 3.1] Vu is continuously embedded into the space Yu of functions
v : R+ → R, for which the corresponding norm

kvkYu := ZR3

v(|R|)e−βu(|R|) dR

(6.4)

is ﬁnite. In view of (6.3) ℓΛ is a linear functional in Y ′
u is uniformly
bounded. Furthermore, for v ∈ Yu with compact support the compact convergence
of ξΛ → ξ as |Λ| → ∞ implies that

u, and {ℓΛ}Λ ⊂ Y ′

ℓΛ(v) → ℓ(v) = ZR3

v(|R − R0|)ξ(R) dR ,

|Λ| → ∞ ,

FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

17

hence, the assertion of the lemma follows from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem for
every v ∈ Yu, and hence, every v ∈ Vu.

To apply this result to (6.1) and (6.2) we need to estimate the molecular distri-

bution functions when their arguments get close.

Proposition 6.2. Let u be a stable and regular pair potential and let z satisfy

(2.8). Then there exists C > 0, independent of the size of Λ, such that

from (3.6), (3.11), (3.14), and (3.17) that

The assertion now follows by inserting the deﬁnition (3.12) of dIm,m.

Combining Lemma 6.1 and Proposition 6.2 we readily obtain the thermodynam-
ical limits of the three single integrals occurring in (6.1) and (6.2). The thermody-
namical limits of the remaining two double integrals involving χ(m)
Λ , m = 3, 4 in (6.1)
and (6.2), respectively, are more subtle and will be considered next.

Again, we start with an auxiliary result.
Lemma 6.3. Let u satisfy Assumption A, and χΛ : Λ2 → R be a family of

functions with

|χΛ(R1, R2)| ≤ e−βu(|R1−R2|)(cid:0)X(R1) + X(R2)(cid:1)

(6.7)

for all R1, R2 ∈ Λ, where X ∈ L1(R3) is nonnegative and bounded and does not
depend on Λ. Furthermore, assume that χΛ converges compactly to χ : (R3)2 → R as
|Λ| → ∞. Then for every v ∈ Vu there holds

ZΛZΛ

v(|R1 − R2|)χΛ(R1, R2) dR1 dR2 → ZR3ZR3

v(|R1 − R2|)χ(R1, R2) dR1 dR2

as |Λ| → ∞.

Proof. Throughout, we extend χΛ by zero to (R3)2 \ Λ2, and this extension, of
course, satisﬁes (6.7) for all R1, R2 ∈ R3. Because of the compact convergence χΛ → χ
as |Λ| → ∞ this inequality also extends to χ, i.e.,

Substituting R′

|χ(R1, R2)| ≤ e−βu(|R1−R2|)(cid:0)X(R1) + X(R2)(cid:1) ,

where r = (r′ − |R′
Ω ⊂ R3 and any ε > 0 we can ﬁx r′ so large that the sum of the latter three integrals

2 ∈ Ar′ we can use
the compact convergence of χΛ to also bound the former integral by ε/2 by choosing
|Λ| suﬃciently large. Thus we have shown that

provided that |Λ| is suﬃciently large. In other words, there holds J → 0 as |Λ| → ∞,
uniformly in Ω, which was to be shown.

FRECHET DIFFERENTIABILITY OF MOLECULAR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

This result, together with the estimates of χ(3)

Λ in Propositions 4.2 and
4.3, respectively, shows that the double integrals (6.1) and (6.2) have a well-deﬁned
thermodynamical limit. In particular, taking into account that the thermodynamical
limits of ρ(m) are even and translation invariant functions, we ﬁnd that

Λ and χ(4)

(cid:0)(∂ρ(2))v(cid:1)(R, 0) = − β v(|R|)ρ(2)(R, 0) − 2βZR3
