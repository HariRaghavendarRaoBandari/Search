Application of the conﬂuent Heun functions to study
the physics of black holes: resonant frequencies and
scattering of scalar waves

H. S. Vieira · V. B. Bezerra

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract We study the scattering and the resonant frequencies (quasispectrum)
of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman-Kasuya spacetime (dyon black
hole). The equations of motion are written into a Heun form, and its analytical
solutions are obtained. We obtain the resonant frequencies expression and the
general exact regular partial wave solution. The special cases of the Kerr and
Schwarzschild black holes are analyzed and the solutions are shown.

Now, let us consider the curved spacetime generated by a dyon black hole,

whose line element in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is given by [1]

where a = J/M is the angular momentum per mass, Qe is the electric charge,
Qm is the magnetic charge, M is the mass (energy), and ξ = ±1 (these two signs
correspond to the two gauges of this background). Note that the units G ≡ c ≡
 ≡ 1 were chosen.
Due to the time independence and symmetry of the spacetime, we can substi-
tute the wave function by the following expansion

Ψ = Ψ (r, t) = R(r)S(θ)eimφe−iωt ,

(7)

where m = ±1, ±2,±3, . . . is the azimuthal quantum number, and ω is the energy
(frequency).
Thus, the exact solution of the angular part of the Klein-Gordon equation,
S(θ), for a charged massive scalar ﬁeld in the dyon black hole, over the entire
range 0 ≤ z < ∞, can be written as [2]

These two functions form linearly independent solutions of the conﬂuent Heun

Here too there is not any speciﬁc physical reason to impose that β should be
integer.

In what follows, we will take into account the properties of the conﬂuent Heun
functions in order to discuss the quasispectrum and the scattering eﬀect of scalar
waves by a dyonic black hole.

2 Resonant frequencies

In this section we present a new simple technique for investigating the resonant fre-
quencies (quasispectrum) of a dyonic black hole, using directly the exact solutions
of the Klein-Gordon equation.

Many authors have considered the ‘quasispectrum’ of massive ﬁelds on several
black hole spacetimes. The terminology ‘quasinormal modes’ have been used by
Simone et al. [5] and Fiziev [6], and ‘bound states’ by Dolan et al. [7]; here we
use ‘quasispectrum’ generically, which have no implication with time-reversal sym-
metry. Quasispectrum is not to be confused with ‘quasinormal modes’ or ‘bound
states’. More speciﬁcally, quasinormal modes represent the scattering resonances
of the ﬁelds in the black hole spacetime, where these characteristic resonances
correspond to the poles of the (frequency dependent) transmission and reﬂection
amplitudes (or are associated with a maximum in the eﬀective potential), while
for computing the discrete spectrum of bound states, the radial solution should
be ﬁnite on the horizon and decay exponentially towards inﬁnity.

We now formulate a practical method for computing the discrete spectrum of
energy levels. In essence, we wish to solve Eq. (7) for the radial part R(r) subject
to certain boundary conditions. The solution should be ﬁnite on the horizon and
well behaved far from the black hole.

In order to compute these ﬁeld energies we need to impose boundary conditions
on the solutions at the asymptotic region (inﬁnity), which in this case, requires
the necessary condition for a polynomial form of R(x). Thus, in order to have a
polynomial solution of the conﬂuent Heun equation (15), we must impose the so
called δ-condition [8]

It is not possible to obtain an analytic expression for ωn from Eq. (23), how-
ever, there are several numerical methods that can be used to obtain approximate
expressions for each energy level [9].

2.1 Massless scalar ﬁelds

Let ωQS = ωR + iωI denote the real and imaginary parts of the resonant frequen-
cies. Thus, the quasispectrum of massless scalar ﬁelds, µ0 = 0, it is such that

(29)

If we consider the neighborhood of the irregular singular point at inﬁnity, the
two solutions of the conﬂuent Heun equation exist, and in general they can be
expanded (in a sector) in the following asymptotic series [10]

HeunC(α, β, γ, δ, η, x) ∼ C1 x−( β+γ+2

+ δ

α ) + C2 e−αxx−( β+γ+2

(30)

where we are keeping only the ﬁrst term of this power-series asymptotics.

Thus, from Eqs. (16) and (30) we can see that the radial solution given by
Eq. (15), far from the black hole, that is, when |r| → ∞ which implies that
|x| → ∞, behaves asymptotically as

where all constants are included in C1 and C2. Thus, the radial wave function can
be written as

These solutions for the scalar ﬁelds far from the black hole will be useful to
investigate the scattering of charged massive scalar particles. It is worth calling
attention to the fact that we are using the analytical solution of the radial part of
the Klein-Gordon equation in the spacetime under consideration.

Indeed, the phase shift σλ is not a simple function of l, the exact expression of
the scattering amplitude is not available but just an approximate one is obtained,
as is shown for instance by Abramov et al. [11].

4 Special cases

H. S. Vieira, V. B. Bezerra

In the last section we have used the conventional forms of the series expansions
and asymptotic forms for the conﬂuent Heun functions HeunC(α, β, γ, δ, η, x) to
derive the form of the radial solution.

Now, from this general exact solution given by Eq. (35), we can write down

some particular results for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.

4.1 The Kerr black hole

In the special case of Qe = Qm = 0 the metric given by Eq. (2) reduces to the
Kerr form. Accordingly we have

∆ = r2 − 2M r + a2 ,
r± = M ± (M 2 − a2)1/2 .

Then, from Eqs. (17) and (20):

1
2

− i

α = k0(r+ − r−) ,

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

2 .

where k2

0 ≡ ω2 − µ2

0 and γ0 ≡ (M µ2

i

= γ0 ,

δ
α
0 − 2M ω2)/(ω2 − µ2
0)

Therefore, the analytical solution for the regular partial wave, in this case, is

given by

Rl(r) ∼ Cl

1
r

sin[k0r − γ0 ln r + σl(ω)] ,

(40)

where the eigenvalues λ = λlm (l, m are integers such that |m| ≤ l) are not
expressible in analytic form in terms of l and m.

4.1.1 Massless scalar ﬁelds

For the massless case, that is, µ0 = 0, we have

k0 = ω ,

γ0 = −2M ω .

Now, using the deﬁnition of the tortoise coordinate, r∗, namely,

when r → ∞ we get

dr
dr∗

=

∆

r2 + a2 ,

r∗ = r + 2M ln r .

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

In this new coordinate, we obtain the following scattering wave solution for

massless scalar particles in the Kerr spacetime

Rλ(r) ∼

1
r

(A eiωr∗ + B e−iωr∗ ) ,

(45)

Application of the conﬂuent Heun functions to study the physics of black holes

where A and B are constants and describe the incident and reﬂected wave coeﬃ-
cients, respectively. The solution (45) is exactly the solution obtained by Starobin-
sky [12], Handler and Matzner [13], and Glampedakis and Andersson [14].

Furthermore, from Eq. (23) we can write the expression of the resonant fre-

quencies for massless scalar ﬁelds in the Kerr spacetime, which is given by

ωR =

ω+κ− + ω−κ+

4M κ+κ− + κ+ + κ−

ωI =

2κ+κ−(n + 1)

4M κ+κ− + κ+ + κ−

,

,

(46)

(47)

where n ≥ 0. The solutions (46) and (47) generalizes the one obtained by Felice
[15] in the sence that we have analytic solution valid over the range 0 < ω < ∞
and |m| ≤ l, contrary to the result of Felice which was obtained for high angular
momentum and low energy (frequency).

4.2 The Schwarzschild black hole

In this case, the metric (2) reduces to the Schwarzschild form when we take a =
Qe = Qm = 0:

Then, we have

∆ = r2 − 2M r ,

rh = 2M .

0 = ω2 − µ2
k2
0 ,

γ0 =

0 − 2M ω2

M µ2
(ω2 − µ2
0)

1
2

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

.

Therefore, the analytical solution for the regular partial wave has the asymp-

totic form

Rl(r) ∼ Cl

1
r

sin(cid:20)k0r − γ0 ln r −

lπ
2

+ σl(ω)(cid:21) ,

where λ = l(l + 1), and the phase shift σl is given by

σl(ω) = arg Γ (l + 1 + iγ0) .

(52)

(53)

The solution (52) is exactly the solution obtained by Koﬁnti [16].

8

H. S. Vieira, V. B. Bezerra

4.2.1 Massless scalar ﬁelds

For the massless case, µ0 = 0, we have

k0 = ω ,

Rl(r) ∼ Cl

1
r

γ0 = −2M ω ,

sin(cid:20)ωr + 2M ω ln r −

lπ
2

+ δl(ω)(cid:21) .

(54)

(55)

(56)

This is exactly the solution obtained by Sanchez [17], where the phase shift δl(ω)
was obtained by JWKB approximation.

Finally, from Eq. (23), the resonant frequencies for massless scalar ﬁelds in the

Schwarzschild spacetime is given by

ωQS =

i

4M

(n + 1) ,

(57)

where n ≥ 0.
