Abstract. Classical MHD reconnection theories, both the stationary Sweet-Parker model and
the tearing instability, are known to provide rates which are too slow to explain the observations.
However, a recent analysis has shown that there exists a critical threshold on current sheet’s
thickness, namely a/L ∼ S−1/3, beyond which the tearing modes evolve on fast macroscopic
Alfv´enic timescales, provided the Lunquist number S is high enough, as invariably found in
solar and astrophysical plasmas. Therefore, the classical Sweet-Parker scenario, for which the
diﬀusive region scales as a/L ∼ S−1/2 and thus can be up to ∼ 100 times thinner than the
critical value, is likely to be never realized in nature, as the current sheet itself disrupts in the
elongation process. We present here two-dimensional, compressible, resistive MHD simulations,
with S ranging from 105 to 107, that fully conﬁrm the linear analysis. Moreover, we show that
a secondary plasmoid instability always occurs when the same critical scaling is reached on the
local, smaller scale, leading to a cascading explosive process, reminiscent of the ﬂaring activity.

1. Introduction: from slow to ideal reconnection
Magnetic reconnection is thought to be the primary mechanism providing fast energy
release,
in astrophysical and
laboratory magnetically dominated plasmas. Within the macroscopic regime of resistive
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), however, classical reconnection models predict timescales, in
highly conducting plasmas, which are too slow to explain bursty phenomena such as solar ﬂares
in the corona or tokamak disruptions. In the following we summarize the main results of classical
theories and the latest developments in this subject.

Given a plasma ﬂow pattern (cid:126)v, the magnetic ﬁeld evolution is governed within resistive MHD

by the induction equation

∂ (cid:126)B
∂t

= ∇ × ((cid:126)v × (cid:126)B) + η∇2 (cid:126)B,

(1)

where η is the magnetic diﬀusivity, supposed to be a constant. A simple dimensional analysis
allows one to separate the characteristic timescales of ﬂuid advection and Ohmic diﬀusion

where S is the Lundquist number, that is the magnetic Reynolds number deﬁned via the
macroscopic quantities L and cA, the Alfv´en speed. Astrophysical tenuous plasmas are
characterized by very large values of S, say up to S ∼ 1012, so that diﬀusion occurs on very long
timescales and only where currents are strong, that is in current sheets.

The Sweet-Parker model

reconnection [1, 2] predicts, for an aspect ratio L/a (L is the current sheet length or breadth,
identiﬁed with the macroscopic scale, and a its width), a rate of reconnected ﬂux

leading to time scales τ /τA ∼ S1/2, far too slow to explain solar ﬂares with τ ∼ 0.1− 1τA ∼ 103s.
The linear stability of a current sheet of inﬁnite length was investigated by [3], who discovered
that the equilibrium is unstable to the tearing mode, leading to the formation of X-points and
plasmoids during the reconnection process. If measured on top of the only available scale, the
sheet half width a (from now on starred quantities refer to a rather than L, so they indicate
local properties rather than global), the instability growth rate γ = 1/τ is, again, far too slow

γ τ∗

A ∼ S∗−1/2 ,

kmaxa ∼ S∗−1/4

(τ∗
A = a/cA, S∗ = a cA/η),

(4)

where kmax is the wave number at which the instability peaks. The scaling for γ is exactly the
same found for the stationary rate R in the SP model, so once more we would need extremely
small scales to explain the observations.

In order to make a step forward, one could also investigate the behaviour of the extremely
thin current sheets predicted by the SP stationary theory. As ﬁrst demonstrated by means
of 2D MHD simulations [4], reconnecting SP-like sites become unstable once the Lundquist
number exceeds a critical value of order S ∼ 104, and are subject to fast tearing modes and
plasmoid formation when their aspect ratio L/a becomes large enough, also increasing the
local reconnection rate. Recent detailed linear analyses and simulations have conﬁrmed these
ﬁndings [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
In particular, the SP current sheet, of inverse aspect
ratio a/L ∼ S−1/2, in the presence of the typical inﬂow/outﬂow pattern characterizing steady
reconnection, was shown to be tearing unstable with growth rate and wave number of maximal
instability

γ τA ∼ S1/4 (cid:29) 1,

kmaxL ∼ S3/8 (cid:29) 1.

(5)

However, the existence of instabilities with growth rates scaling as a positive power of S poses
severe conceptual problems, since the ideal limit, corresponding to S → ∞ would lead to
inﬁnitely fast instabilities, while it is well known that in ideal MHD reconnection is impossible.
Moreover, the positive power of S also for kmaxL indicates an explosive behaviour of the tearing
mode, with the formation of a large number of plasmoids. From these paradoxical ﬁndings it
should be clear that, since SP current sheets are violently unstable in the ideal MHD limit
S → ∞, this could only imply that such extremely elongated equilibrium structures with
a/L ∼ S−1/2 (10−6 in corona) simply cannot form in nature.
This issue was resolved by [14] (PV hereafter), who studied the stability of current sheets
with generic inverse aspect ratios a/L ∼ S−α. The authors showed that a critical exponent
separates current sheets subject to slow instabilities, with growth rates scaling as a negative
power of S, from the unphysical fast instabilities scaling as a positive power of S. For this
generic dependence the growth rate is

a/L ∼ S−α ⇒ γ ∼ τ∗

A

−1S∗−1/2 = τ−1

A S−1/2S3/2α

thus, there is a critical value for what they called the ideal tearing mode, given by

α = 1/3 ⇒ γ ∼ τ−1

asymptotic value of γmaxτA (cid:39) 0.62.

for which the growth rate of the fastest reconnecting mode becomes independent on the
Lundquist number. Notice that for S = 1012 the threshold a/L ∼ S−1/3 = 104 is 100 times
larger than the SP one. Thus, in this limit reconnection starts to occur on ideal timescales,
and the SP conﬁguration is never established in the thinning process. This scenario should also
survive in the presence of moderate viscosity [15].

Going in deeper details, consider a current sheet deﬁned by the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld
B0y(x) (for example the Harris sheet), the usual tearing mode linear analysis for ﬂuctuations
∼ f (x) exp (γt + iky) in an incompressible medium leads to the system [3]

(9)

where vx and bx are the linear ﬂuctuations across the sheet (the other components are retrieved
by ∇ · (cid:126)v = ∇ · (cid:126)b = 0). When letting x → x/a and ka → k with a ∼ S−1/3, the dispersion
relation γ(k) for varying S clearly shows curves with an ideal asymptotic limit γmax (cid:39) 0.62τ−1
for S (cid:29) 1, as can be seen in ﬁgure 1, taken from PV.

A

The wave number kmax corresponding to the maximum growth rates is seen to decrease with

S as

a/L ∼ S−1/6 ⇒ kmaxa ∼ S−1/6,

(10)

as expected. However, once the macroscopic normalization against the current sheet length L
is recovered, we do expect a number of islands actually increasing with S

kmaxL ∼ S1/6,

(11)

thus even this ideal tearing mode leads to the disruption of the current sheet in a large number
of islands, well before the SP sheet conﬁguration (thinner than this one) can be reached.

2. Numerical simulations: setup
In order to prove the analytical theory by PV, [16] performed 2D resistive MHD simulations
of the same scenario, that is they studied numerically the stability of a PV current sheet with

a/L ∼ S−1/3, subject to initially small velocity perturbations. Here we summarize and report
the main results.

normalized using Alfv´enic units, namely a characteristic length scale L, a characteristic density

that we are using the energy equation (14) written for the normalized temperature T = p/ρ,
where we use as a reference value T0 = (m/kB)c2
A. With the given normalizations the Lundquist
number is basically the inverse of the magnetic diﬀusivity, namely S = cAL/η → η−1.

where ζ = 0 for the Harris sheet case with Bz = 0 and pressure equilibrium (PE hereafter), with
p varying to preserve p+B2/2 constant, and ζ = 1 for the force-free equilibrium (FFE hereafter)
with magnetic ﬁeld rotating across the sheet.
Intermediate cases of mixed ﬂuid/magnetic
pressure equilibrium with 0 < ζ < 1 are also possible.
The compressible, resistive MHD equations (12-15) are solved in a rectangular numerical box
[−Lx, Lx]× [0, Ly] with resolution Nx and Ny respectively. In the x-direction, in order to resolve
the steep gradients inside the current sheet using a reasonable number of grid points, we limit
our domain to a few times the current sheet thickness, i.e. we set Lx = 20a, with a = S−1/3:
this is a good compromise between the high resolution required inside the current sheet and
the need to have boundaries suﬃciently far from the reconnecting region. Along the y-direction
the length is chosen in order to resolve for the fastest growing modes of the instability (see [16]
for details). Finally, incompressible velocity perturbations of amplitude ε ∼ 10−3are applied at
t = 0 in order to trigger the instability.

The numerical simulations are performed by integrating equations (12-15) with an MHD
code developed by our group. Along the current sheet, where periodicity is assumed, spatial
integration is performed by using pseudo-spectral methods, while in the x-direction integration
is performed by the use of a fourth-order scheme based on compact ﬁnite-diﬀerences [17]. The
boundary conditions in the non-periodic direction are treated with the method of projected
characteristics, here assuming non-reﬂecting boundary conditions. Time integration is performed
using a third-order Runge-Kutta method. Details of the code are described in [18]. The

for S = 105 and S = 106 we choose
resolution is adapted to the Lundquist number we use:
Nx = 1024 and Ny = 128, while for S = 107 the number of cells in the x direction is increased
up to Nx = 2048. In the periodic direction we use Ny = 128 for the single-mode runs (in order
to reduce the computational costs as many simulations are required to reproduce the instability
dispersion relation curves), while we take Ny = 256 in the nonlinear reference simulation. We
have veriﬁed that this relatively low resolution along the periodic direction is adequate, due
the extreme accuracy of Fourier methods and the rather smooth gradients observed in the y
direction. In spite of the relatively high values of S, in addition to the instability evolution, the
initial equilibrium diﬀuses on timescales which, although long compared to the instability one,
are still suﬃcient to underestimate the growth rates of linear modes. To avoid this problem,
only for the single mode linear analysis, the diﬀusion term of the initial equilibrium (not that
related to the perturbations, obviously needed for the tearing instability evolution) is removed
from the induction equation at all times, as explained in [19].

3. Numerical simulations: single mode analysis
A ﬁrst set of simulations of the tearing instability in current sheets with a = S−1/3 is performed
to conﬁrm the expected linear behavior presented in Section 1. We choose to test the two limits
of our initial equilibria for the current sheet, namely PE (ζ = 0) and FFE (ζ = 1). Moreover,
we investigate both cases with β < 1 (β = 0.1) and β > 1 (β = 1.6), where β is the asymptotic
plasma beta in equation (16), even if no diﬀerences are expected at the linear level from the
incompressible, analytical analysis. Finally, three diﬀerent values of the Lundquist number are
tested here, namely S = 105, 106, and 107, for a total of 12 sets of simulations of the linear
phase of the tearing instability, with the aim of reproducing the expected dispersion relations
numericall, as shown in ﬁgure 2. As anticipated in the previous section, for each value of ka

automatically determined by the solenoidal constraint), vy, and vx. Top panel: analytical linear
theory; bottom panel: numerical results. All proﬁles are normalized to their maximum value.

we vary Ly while always selecting a single mode m = 1. The growth rate of the instability
is computed by measuring the x-averaged amplitude of the component bx of the perturbed
magnetic ﬁeld (bx = 0 at the initial time).

The ﬁrst thing to notice by inspecting the computed dispersion relations is that, as predicted
by the classical linear theory, for each value of S the curves have a maximum at a given k, the
peak location decreasing in k as S increases. The growth rate of the instability (normalized to
the inverse of the large-scale Alfv´en time τA) has peaks ranging from γ ≈ 0.5 for S = 105 to
γ > 0.6 for S = 107. In general we ﬁnd that the simulations with β = 1.6 (bottom panel) are
more precise in matching the analytical results than those with β = 0.1 (top panel), since a
large beta is a condition closer to incompressibility (formally corresponding to an inﬁnite value
for the sound speed). Moreover, we ﬁnd that simulations of the FFE scenario (squares) yield
higher values of the growth rates, closer to the results from the analytic theory, as compared
to those employing the PE settings (crosses): this is probably due to the fact that the purely
force-free equilibrium leads to intrinsically less compressible ﬂuctuations. Finally, rather large
discrepancies are observed for small scales (large values of ka), especially in the PE case.
In ﬁgure 3 we plot the proﬁles of the perturbations bx (by is determined by ∇· B = 0), vy and
vx, all normalized to their respective maximum, across the current sheet in the x direction. In
the top panels we show the analytical results, that is the eigenmodes of the linear analysis (here
the PV calculations have been recomputed by imposing vx = 0 for x = ±20a), and in the lower
panels we report the numerical solutions for a simulation in the FFE scenario with S = 107
and ka = 0.10, at a given time of the linear evolution of the instability. In order to recover the
theoretical eigenmodes, velocity and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations are shown with a π/2 shift in
ky, as expected. Notice the steep gradients arising within the current sheet (|x| ≤ a), where a
high resolution is needed to resolve the small scales developed during the instability evolution.
The eigenmodes are very well reproduced: the magnetic ﬁeld perturbations are identical to the
analytical expected ones, while in the velocity perturbations the only major diﬀerence is due to
the non-reﬂecting free-outﬂow boundary conditions imposed, that do not force vx = 0 at x = ±a
as in the analytical solutions and result in a slightly diﬀerent proﬁle even in the vicinity of the
reconnecting region.

4. Numerical simulations: fully nonlinear case
Now we describe the nonlinear stages of the evolution of the tearing instability. Since we are
interested in its late development, where interaction and merging of plasmoids is expected, we
trigger the instability by selecting an initial spectrum of modes, rather than a single one as in
the previous set of simulations, and we choose a maximum mode number mmax = 10. We also
choose Ly = 1 and S = 107, so the modes with ka (cid:39) 0.029 m; m = 1, 10 are all excited. From
the theoretical curves in the previous section we expect mainly a competition between modes
m = 3 and m = 4 as the fast growing ones. As a reference run, we analyze the instability of
a force-free equilibrium with constant temperature (FFE, ζ = 1), and we select the case with
β = 1.6. This combination was shown to provide a linear phase which is the closest to the
analytical expectations (see ﬁgure 2). The resolution employed for this run is 2048× 256, which
is very high if one consider that the code employs high-order methods (compact ﬁnite-diﬀerences
along x and Fourier transforms along y, where periodical boundary conditions apply).
The complete evolution is shown in ﬁgure 4, where 2D snapshots for selected times are
provided, of the region |x/a| < 10. Note that the ﬁgure has diﬀerent scales in x and y, the
x axis is normalized against a, the y axis against L, with L/a = S1/3 (cid:39) 215). Panels on the
left show the Jz current component, whereas panels on the right show the distorted ﬁeld lines
superimposed on a map of temperature T . It is easy to recognize the end of the linear phase of
the tearing instability (top row), with the dominant m = 3 mode still clearly apparent. When
the tearing instability growth is over, the nonlinear phase sets in leading to further reconnection
events and eventually to island coalescence, departing from the dominant phase with m = 3.
First, due to the attraction of current concentrations of the same sign, the X-points elongate
and stretch along the y direction. This process leads to a strong increase of the electric current
concentrations and thus to the formation of new, elongated current sheets (see the second row,
details of this phase will be discussed further on). Beyond t (cid:39) 9 (third row) the evolution has
become fully nonlinear and we clearly observe the process leading to the creation of a single,
large magnetic island as arising from coalescence. The situation is very dynamic, especially
near the major X-point where explosive expulsion of smaller and smaller islands is observed,
typical of the plasmoid instability. These islands then move towards the largest one, which is
continually fed and thus further increases its size in a sort of inverse cascade eventually leading
to the largest m = 1 mode. Notice also the temperature enhancement at the reconnection
sites. At time t = 9.5 (bottom row) both the current concentration and the plasma temperature
around the X-point are so high that we need to saturate their values in order to retain an
appropriate dynamical range in the color bar. The initial macroscopic current sheet is basically
disrupted in a series of highly dynamical features. The current and temperature enhancements
are stronger at the X-point and at the boundaries of the magnetic islands. Moreover, from the
major reconnecting site we clearly see the production of magnetosonic waves, which propagate
and soon steepen into shocks.

Let us now investigate in more detail the situation right after the end of the linear phase
of the tearing instability, when the islands coalescence is about to set in and the local current
sheets have just formed and start to further evolve. In ﬁgure 5 (left panel) we show the zoom
around the X-point (which is just about to develop) near y = 0.2 at t = 8.25, the ﬁrst row of
ﬁgure 4. Here we display the electric current by using the same scaling in both x and y directions,
normalized against the macroscopic current sheet’s width a = S−1/3 (cid:39) 1/200 (cid:39) 5 × 10−3, thus
the position of the reconnection zone is now expressed as y (cid:39) 40a. The local current sheet
has just formed as the result of a stretching process in the y direction (and shrinking across the
other direction), as a typical output of the nonlinear phase of the tearing instability. We are now
in the phase in which, in the center of the current sheet, reconnection is about to take place,
leading to a topology change in the magnetic structure and to the disruption of the current
sheet itself, initially into two smaller strips. It is very interesting to measure the aspect ratio

component, while on the right panels the magnetic ﬁeldlines and the plasma temperature are
displayed. Notice that the x and y scales are diﬀerent and that we are showing the inner region
|x| ≤ 10a, while the computation extends out to |x| = 20a.

of this reconnection site. From the white box in the ﬁgure, deﬁned by the rectangular region
where the Jz component has values which are roughly half those of the central peak, we estimate
L∗/a∗ (cid:39) 200, where we have used an asterisk to indicate the local values and to diﬀerentiate
with respect to the macroscopic ones (we also recall that in the whole paper we identify a as the
half width of a current sheet). Additional simulations for S = 106 and S = 105, reported in the
second and third panels, lead to local aspect ratios of L∗/a∗ (cid:39) 80 and L∗/a∗ (cid:39) 50, respectively.
If we now compare these numbers with S∗α, trying to ﬁnd a value of α that ﬁts the data
best, it is easy to see that the value α = 1/3 is a very good guess. Here S∗ = (L∗/L)S is the
local Lundquist number, which is obviously smaller than the macroscopic one, due to the much
smaller length of the local current sheet (to be measured in each case). Therefore, based on our
very limited data set, we derive the scaling

L∗/a∗ = k S∗1/3,

(17)
where k (cid:39) 2.1 − 2.3, that is of order unity, as expected. In ﬁgure 6 we report the numerical
results, assuming a 10% error on both L∗/a∗ and S∗, for the sequence of increasing (macroscopic)
Lundquist numbers S = 105, S = 106, and S = 107. The scaling in equation (17) is over-plotted,
as a solid line, for the average value of k = 2.2.

5. Conclusions
In the present paper we have summarized the main results of the analytical analysis by [14]
and of the numerical simulations by [16], who studied, by means of compressible, resistive
MHD simulations, the linear and nonlinear stages of the tearing instability of a current sheet
with inverse aspect ratio a/L ∼ S−1/3, where S (cid:29) 1 is the Lundquist number measured on
the macroscopic scale (the current sheet length) and the asymptotic Alfv´en speed. Our results
conﬁrm on the one hand the linear analysis of PV of the ideal tearing mode, leading to extremely
fast growth rates with γ ∼ τ−1
A when S is suﬃciently large, and on the other hand the nonlinear

sheets undergoing secondary reconnection events, together with the theoretical expectation of
equation (17) plotted for k = 2.2 (the average value derived from data). The corresponding
values of the macroscopic Lundquist number are S = 105, S = 106, and S = 107.

simulations show that the evolution follows what appears to be a quasi-self-similar path, with
subsequent collapse, current sheet thinning, elongation, and destabilization, starting from the X-
points formed in the original sheet. As scales become smaller, and the local Lundquist numbers
decrease, the dynamical time-scales decrease too, leading to explosive behavior.

These ﬁndings are very important, in our opinion. For the ﬁrst time we clearly see in
simulations that, even in the nonlinear stages of the tearing instability, the new current sheets
that form locally become unstable when the inverse aspect ratio of these structures reaches the
critical threshold of a∗/L∗ ∼ S∗−1/3 (where the star indicates the local, smaller scale), precisely
the same limit found by PV for the fast reconnection of the initial, macroscopic current sheet.
After that, a new ideal tearing instability starts, with time occurring on a faster timescale
A = L∗/cA, since typically L∗ (cid:28) L. Furthermore, when smaller and smaller scales are produced
τ∗
nonlinearly, as observed at the time proceeds, each time the newly formed local current sheets
elongate and reach their own critical value, that corresponding to equation (17), faster and faster
reconnection will arise producing a cascading, accelerating process: this, we believe, is the real
nature of the plasmoid (or super-tearing) instability.

There are many space and astrophysical applications of the ideal

including
geomagnetic storms in our planet, coronal heating and coronal mass ejections from the Sun. As
future work we plan to move to 3D simulations [20, 21] and to investigate the tearing instability
of thin current sheets within relativistic MHD [22, 23, 24]. Fast reconnection in magnetically
dominated plasmas is of paramount importance in high-energy astrophysics too [25], invariably
invoked in models for magnetar ﬂares, acceleration of Poynting-dominated jets, and dissipation
in pulsar winds [26, 27, 28].
