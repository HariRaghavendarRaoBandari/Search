ABSTRACT: A single water molecule has nothing special. However, macroscopic water displays
many anomalous properties at the interface, such as a high surface tension, hydrophobicity and
hydrophillicity. Although the underlying mechanism is still elusive, hydrogen bond is expected to
have played an important role. An interesting question is if the few-water molecule clusters will
be qualitatively diﬀerent from a single molecule. Using adsorption behavior as an example, by
carefully choosing two-dimensional silicene as the substrate material, we demonstrate that water
monomer, dimer and trimer show contrasting properties. The additional water molecules in dimer
and trimer induce a transition from physisorption to chemisorption then to dissociation on silicene.
Such a hydrogen bond autocatalytic eﬀect is expected to have a broad application potential in
silicene-based water molecule sensor and metal-free catalyst for water dissociation.

INTRODUCTION

Hydrogen bonding is crucial in many molecular and
supramolecular systems, such as water, polymers and
proteins. It determines many of their chemical and phys-
ical properties.[1–3] Hydrogen bonding in water plays an
important role in distinguishing it from other systems
with comparable molecular mass. At the same time, wa-
ter is also unique among other hydrogen-bonded systems
since it has a very large number of hydrogen bonds per
unit mass. Beyond bulk properties, the structure of wa-
ter at the interface with other materials can induce many
anomalous properties, such as a high surface tension of
water, hydrophobicity and hydrophillicity.[4] In fact, wa-
ter at the interface plays a critical role in wide aspects
ranging from daily life to science and technology.

water adsorption than traditional 3D noble metals and

ciation. However, water molecules are physically ad-
sorbed on graphene with very small adsorption energies
via weak van der Waals interactions[35] and graphene is
strongly hydrophobic,[36] preventing immediate practical
applications on graphene based sensitive molecule sensor
and eﬃcient catalyst if without introducing dopants or
defects.[30, 32, 33, 37]

lar dynamics simulations, we ﬁnd that hydrogen bond-
ing in water dimer and trimer can induce autocatalytic
chemisorption and dissociation of water molecules on
silicene. Furthermore, the interaction between water
molecules and silicene increases as the number of hy-
drogen bonding in water molecules. We also ﬁnd that
silicene is hydrophilic diﬀerent from graphene.

THEORETICAL MODELS AND METHODS

The lattice parameter of silicene calculated to setup
unit cell is 3.866 ˚A, agreeing well with previous theo-
retical works.[47] In order to simulate the inﬁnite planar
monolayer, a 4 × 4 supercell of silicene containing 32 sil-
icon atoms is adopted. Diﬀerent adsorption sites (valley,
bridge, hollow and top) of water molecules on silicene are
considered as shown in Figure 1. The vacuum space in
the Z direction is about 20 ˚A to separate the interactions
between neighboring slabs.

We use the ﬁrst-principles density functional the-
ory (DFT) calculations implemented in the VASP
package.[68] We choose the generalized gradient approxi-
mation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)[69]
as the exchange-correlation functional, and adopt the
semi-empirical van der Waals dispersion correction pro-
posed by Grimme (DFT-D2)[70] to describe the weak
van der Waals interactions of layered 2D materials and
molecular adsorption on surfaces.[71–78] We check the
adsorption structures of water molecules on silicone with
non-empirical van der Waals density functional (vdW-
DF) scheme proposed by Dion et al.[79] and obtain simi-
lar results. Because the GGA-PBE method trends to un-
derestimate the bandgap of semiconductors, the screened
hybrid HSE06 functional[80] is also used to compute the
electronic band structures. We set the energy cutoﬀ to
be 500 eV. The surface Brillouin zone is sampled with a 3
× 3 regular mesh and 120 (GGA-PBE) or 60 (HSE06) k
points are used for calculating the small band gaps at the
Dirac points of silicene. All the geometry structures are
fully relaxed by using the conjugate gradient (CG) algo-
rithm until total energy and atomic forces are converged
to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV/˚A, respectively. Charge trans-
fer is obtained based on Bader analysis.[81] Ab-initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed
in a canonical ensemble with a 4 × 4 supercell of sil-
icene containing 32 silicon atoms and four layers of water
molecules containing 144 oxygen atoms and 288 hydro-
gen atoms (1.0 g/cm3). The energy cutoﬀ is set to be
350 eV. The simulations are performed for about 13.0 ps
with a time step of 1.0 fs at the temperature of 300 K
controlled by a Nose-Hoover thermostat.[82, 83]

In order to evaluate the stability of water molecules
on silicene, the adsorption energy is deﬁned as Ea =
E((H2O)n/Silicene) - E((H2O)n) - E(Silicene), where,
E((H2O)n/Silicene), E((H2O)n) and E(Silicene) repre-

sent the total energy of water molecules adsorption on
silicene, water molecule clusters and pristine silicene, re-
spectively. For water molecule clusters (n = 2 and 3.),
the binding energy of hydrogen bond is deﬁned as Eb =
E((H2O)n) - nE(H2O), where, E((H2O)n) and E(H2O)
represent the total energy of water molecule clusters
and single water molecule, respectively. As an bench-
mark, DFT-D2 calculations give a good bilayer distance
of 3.25 ˚A and binding energy of -25 meV per carbon
atom for bilayer graphene, fully agreeing with previous
experimental[84, 85] and theoretical[86, 87] studies. Fur-
thermore, DFT-D2 calculations also give accurate bind-
ing energy of -0.26 eV in water molecule dimer.[88]

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We ﬁrst check the adsorption of water monomer on
silicene. Geometric and electronic structures for diﬀer-
ent adsorption sites are shown in Figure 1 and the cor-
responding adsorption properties are listed in Table 1.
Water monomer is physically adsorbed on silicene via van
der Waals interactions,[63, 64] with small adsorption en-
ergies (-0.13 ∼ -0.17 eV) and large adsorption distances
(2.49 ∼ 2.92 ˚A). The top site is the most stable adsorp-
tion site. Water adsorption on silicene acts as an electron
acceptor (0.08 ∼ 0.23 e), similar to graphene.[34–36]
Silicene’s linear Dirac-like dispersion relation E(k) =
±νF|k| around the Fermi level is slightly aﬀected by
adsorption of water monomer. The Fermi velocity νF =
(1/)(ðE/ðk) is about 105 m/s for water adsorbed sil-
icene, only slightly lower than that of the freestanding
silicone. Therefore, silicene’s high carrier mobility can

be preserved for water molecules adsorption. Upon wa-
ter molecule adsorption, a small band gap is opened at
the Dirac point of silicene. For adsorption at the valley,
bridge, and hollow sites, the energy gap is 11, 23 and 13
meV, respectively. They are signiﬁcantly smaller than
thermal ﬂuctuation (about 25 meV) at room tempera-
ture, similar to the graphene case. A wider band gap of
66 meV is opened at the Dirac point if water monomer
is adsorbed at the top site.

As shown in Figure 2, interestingly, water molecule
dimer and trimer are chemically adsorbed and even dis-
sociated on silicene with large adsorption energies (-0.67,
-1.19 and -1.09 eV) via strong covalent Si-O bonds (1.93,
1.81 and 1.77 ˚A) between an oxygen atom (Oa) in wa-
ter and a top silicon atom. Notice that the adsorption
energies predicted here are much larger than the bind-
ing energy of hydrogen bond formation in water clusters
(only -0.26 eV per hydrogen bond). Therefore, this re-
sult suggests that silicene is hydrophilic in contrast to
graphene.[36]

Compared to single molecule case, more sizable band
gaps (121, 128 and 152 meV) are opened at the Dirac
point of silicene for water dimer and trimer chemisorp-
tion on silicene and water trimer dissociation on silicene,
which are signiﬁcantly larger than thermal ﬂuctuation

(25 meV) at room temperature. Furthermore, these gap
values also depend sensitively on the adsorbate concen-
tration. Therefore, water cluster adsorbed silicene sys-
tems have sizable and tunable band gaps with potential
application on silicene based water molecule sensor and
ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors.

ρ((H2O)n/Silicene) - ρ((H2O)n) - ρ(Silicene)) and the
corresponding XY-averaged diﬀerential charge density.
We ﬁnd that more electrons (0.23, 0.44 and 0.50 e) trans-
fer from silicene to water in dimer and trimer adsorp-
tion, and trimer dissociation, compared to that (0.08 e)
in the single water molecule case. Therefore, the interac-
tion between water molecules and silicene increases as the
number of hydrogen bonds formation in water molecules
increases.

molecules ((H2O)1, (H2O)2 and (H2O)3) and the corre-
sponding partial density of states (PDOS) of the oxy-
gen atom (Oa) which binds to silicene upon adsorption.
The frontier orbitals 1b1 (highest occupied molecular or-
bital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
4a1 (LUMO)) of H2O are far away from the Dirac point
of graphene and silicene.[66] Thus, water monomer has

sociation compared to single water molecule adsorption.
Hydrogen bonding in water thus plays an important role
in its adsorption at the H2O/Silicene interface.

low reactivity to both graphene and silicene. But for
water dimer and trimer, the LUMO gets lower and be-
comes closer to the Fermi level as more hydrogen bonds
are formed in water clusters (7.5, 6.6, 6.3 and 6.3 eV re-
spectively for water monomer physisorption, water dimer
chemisorption, trimer chemisorption and dissociation on
silicene). Especially for for the LUMO states contributed
by the Oa atom, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant energy shift of LUMO
in water molecules makes electron transfer from silicene
to water easier. Notice that the Oa atom in the structure
of water trimer for dissociation on silicene shows more lo-
calized LUMO states compared to that in water trimer
for chemisorption on silicene. Therefore, the activated
Oa atom can form a Si-O bond upon adsorption, show-
ing an autocatalytic behavior for chemisorption and dis-

We notice that water cluster is physically adsorbed on
graphene, which can be understood from the electronic
structure diﬀerence between graphene and silicene.[64]
Although they have similar work functions, the reactive
pz state is closer to the Fermi level in silicene compared
to the graphene case. We also check other elemental 2D
materials with higher chemical reactivity than graphene,
such as germanene and phosphorene. Though oxygen
molecules are easily chemically adsorbed and dissociated

physically adsorbed on silicene. At t = 0.3 ps, we ﬁnd
that one water molecule is chemically adsorbed on sil-
icene. At t =0.5 ps, more water molecules are chem-
ically adsorbed and some of them are even dissociated
on silicene at room temperature. At t =1.0 ps, most
of water molecules are dissociated on silicene. After t
=10.0 ps, more and more water molecules are chemically
adsorbed and dissociated on silicene at room tempera-
ture. Therefore, the chemisorption of water molecules
on silicene and the hydrophobicity of silicene provide po-
tential applications on silicene based water molecule sen-
sor and metal-free catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction
and water dissociation without introducing dopants or
defects.[30, 32, 33, 37]

on silicene,[63] germanene[89] and phosphorene[90] at
room temperature, we ﬁnd that water molecules are only
chemically adsorbed and dissociated on silicene. There-
fore, silicene should be a special 2D substrate material
for adsorbing water molecules.

To date, it is still a challenge to obtain freestanding sil-
icene. To conﬁrm that the novel adsorption behavior is
universal, we also consider silicene on a typical substrate,
the Ag(111) surface.[51–54] A 3 × 3 silicene supercell is
used to match a 4 × 4 supercell of the Ag(111) surface,
which gives a negligible lattice mismatch (2%).[52] As
shown in Figure 5, water monomer is still physically ad-
sorbed on Ag-supported silicene (dSi−O = 2.33 ˚A and Ea
= -0.28 eV), and water dimer (dSi−O = 1.90 ˚A and Ea
= -0.93 eV) and trimer (dSi−O = 1.79 ˚A and Ea = -1.64
eV) are chemisorbed on Ag-supported silicene. Further-
more, more electrons (0.21, 0.51, 0.85 and 0.73 e) trans-
fer from Ag-supported silicene to water compared to that
(0.08, 0.23, 0.44 and 0.50 e) of water molecules adsorbed
on free-standing silicene. Therefore, the interaction be-
tween water molecules and silicene is strengthened when
an Ag substrate is presented, similar to water molecules
adsorption on metal-supported grapheme.[38] Although
the substrates do have an eﬀect on water adsorption, the
autocatalytic behavior we observed is quite robust.

In summary, we have explored the interaction between
water molecules and silicene via density functional
theory calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations. We ﬁnd that water monomer interacts
weakly with silicene via a van der Waals interaction. But,
due to the hydrogen bond induced charge transfer, water
clusters (dimer and trimer) are chemically adsorbed and
dissociated on silicene via strong covalent Si-O bonds.
Charge transfer occurs from silicene to water molecules.
Our calculations
silicene is hydrophilic
diﬀerent from other widely studied two-dimensional ma-
terials, and the chemisorption and dissociation of water
molecule clusters on silicene have immediate applications
as water molecule sensor and metal-free catalyst for
oxygen reduction reaction and water dissociation with-
out introducing dopants or defects, superior to graphene.
