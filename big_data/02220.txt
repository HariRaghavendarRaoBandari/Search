CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

FOR RATIONAL CHEREDNIK ALGEBRAS

NICOLAS JACON AND C´EDRIC LECOUVEY

Abstract. We show that the wall crossing bijections between simples
of the category O of the rational Cherednik algebras reduce to particular
crystal isomorphisms which can be computed by a simple combinatorial
procedure on multipartitions of ﬁxed rank.

1. Introduction

The rational Cherednik algebra associated to a complex reﬂection group
W was introduced by Etingof and Ginzburg in [1] as a particular symplectic
reﬂection algebra. In this paper, we will focus on the case where W is the
complex reﬂection group G(l, 1, n) := (Z/lZ)n ⋊Sn. The rational Cherednik
algebra then depends on the choice of a certain parameter s in a (l + 1)-
dimensional C-vector space. There is a distinguished category of modules
over these algebras, the category O, which may be constructed in the same
spirit as the BGG category for a reductive Lie algebra. This category has
been intensively studied during the last decade because of its interesting
structure and also its connection with other important mathematical objects
such as cyclotomic Hecke algebras or cyclotomic q-Schur algebras.

As the simple modules of the associated complex reﬂection groups, the
simple modules in this category are labelled by the set of multipartitions.
A natural and important question is then to understand how are related
the set of simple modules in the category O for diﬀerent choices of the
parameter s. In [9], Losev has deﬁned a collection of hyperplanes in the space
of parameters called “essential walls”. Then, he has shown the existence
of a perverse and derived equivalence between the categories O associated
to distinct parameters s and s′ separated by a single wall.
In particular,
this equivalence induces a bijection between the simples of these categories.
These bijections, called “wall crossing maps”, are of great interest because
they commute with both actions of the Heisenberg algebra and the aﬃne
type A algebra g. In particular, they can be used to compute the support
of the simple modules in the category O and to obtain a classiﬁcation of
the ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations. The goal of the present
paper is to show that, despite their very abstract deﬁnition, there is a simple
combinatorial procedure to compute them.

Because of the above properties, these bijections can also be interpreted
as crystal isomorphisms for certain integrable g-modules: the Fock spaces.
On the other hand, in [6], the authors of the present paper have described
distinguished crystal isomorphisms between such Fock spaces and presented
a simple procedure on multipartitions of ﬁxed rank to compute them. The
aim of this paper is to show how these two isomorphisms are related. To
do this, we ﬁrst review the Uglov g-module structure of the Fock space and
explain how it can be extended. We then construct and explicitly describe
crystal isomorphisms corresponding to this generalized structure. The last
section explores the connections of these isomorphisms with Losev’s wall
crossing bijections. We explain how the crystals appearing in the context
of Cherednik algebras are related with the usual crystals of Fock spaces (in
the sense of Uglov). We obtain in particular an easy criterion to decide
whether an l-partition is a highest weight vertex for this structure. Finally,
the main result gives a simple combinatorial procedure on partitions of ﬁxed
rank for computing an arbitrary wall crossing bijection without referring to
any crystal structure

2. Colored graphs and Fock spaces of JMMO type

We ﬁrst describe structures of colored oriented graphs on the sets of l-
partitions (that we deﬁne below), then focus on a particular case which is

connected to the action of the quantum aﬃne group Uq(csle).

2.1. Combinatorics of l-partitions.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let n ∈ N and l ∈ N:

• A partition λ of rank n is a sequence

(λ1, . . . , λr),

of decreasing non negative integers such that

X1≤i≤r

λi = n.

By convention, we identify two partitions which diﬀer by parts equal
to 0.

• A l-partition (or multipartition) λ of rank n is an l-tuple of partitions
(λ1, . . . , λl) such that the sum of the rank of the partitions λi for
1 ≤ i ≤ l is n. We denote by Πl(n) the set of all l-partitions of
rank n and if λ ∈ Πl(n), we sometimes write λ ⊢l n. The empty
l-partition (which is the l-tuple of empty partitions) is denoted by ∅.

CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

3

Let κ ∈ Q+ and s = (s1, s2, . . . , sl) ∈ Ql. We set s := (κ, s).
One can associate to each λ ⊢l n its Young diagram:

[λ] = {(a, b, c) a ≥ 1, 1 ≤ c ≤ l, 1 ≤ b ≤ λc

a}.

This diagram will be sometimes identify with the l-partition itself. We deﬁne
the s-content of a node γ = (a, b, c) ∈ [λ] as follows:

cont(γ) = b − a + sc ∈ Q,

and the residue of γ is by deﬁnition the content of the node in Q/κ−1Z.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let Is be the subset of Q/κ−1Z formed by the classes x +
sj + κ−1Z, j = 1, . . . , l where x ∈ Z and j ∈ {1, . . . , l}.

We say that γ is a z-node of λ when res(γ) = z + κ−1Z. Finally, we
say that γ is removable when γ = (a, b, c) ∈ λ and λ\{γ} is an l-partition.
Similarly γ is addable when γ = (a, b, c) /∈ λ and λ ∪ {γ} is an l-partition.

Fix z ∈ Is . We assume that we have a total order ≤ on the set of z-nodes
of an arbitrary l-partition. We then deﬁne two operators depending on z
as follows. We consider the set of addable and removable z-nodes of our
l-partition. Let wz(λ) be the word obtained ﬁrst by writing the addable
and removable z-nodes of λ in increasing order with respect to ≤ next by
encoding each addable z-node by the letter A and each removable i-node by

called the normal removable z-nodes. If p > 0, let γ be the rightmost addable

as many subwords of type RA as possible. The word wz(λ) is called the z-

the letter R. Write ewz(λ) = ApRq for the word derived from wz by deleting
word of λ and ewz(λ) the reduced z-word of λ. The addable z-nodes in ewz(λ)
are called the normal addable z-nodes. The removable z-nodes in ewz(λ) are
z-node in ewz. The node γ is called the good addable z-node. If q > 0, the
leftmost removable i-node in ewz is called the good removable z-node.
We then deﬁneee≤
z µ = 0 and if λ has no good addable z-node we set ef ≤
then we set ee≤

z λ = µ if and only if µ is obtained from λ
by adding to λ a good addable z-node, or equivalently, λ is obtained from
µ by removing a good removable z-node. If µ as no good removable z-node
z λ = 0.

2.2. Extended JMMO structure associated to s. We can deﬁne from
s and ≤ a colored oriented graph Gs,≤ as follows:

z µ = λ and ef ≤

• vertices : the l-partitions λ ⊢l n with n ∈ Z≥0
• the arrows are colored by elements in Is and we have: λ

i→ µ for

i ∈ Q/κ−1Z if and only if ee≤

i µ = λ, or equivalently ef ≤

The l-partitions such that eezµ = 0 for all z will be called highest weight

vertices. The set Is of elements in Q/κ−1Z coloring the arrows is called the
indexing set of the graph. Observe the graph Gs,≤ is not an aﬃne A(1)
e−1-
crystal graph in general notably because its indexing set can be distinct
from Z/eZ.

i λ = µ.

4

NICOLAS JACON AND C´EDRIC LECOUVEY

Finally two graphs Gs1,≤1 and Gs1,≤2 on l-partitions with indexing sets I1

and I2 are isomorphic if there exists a bijection

(1)

and a bijection:

(2)

such that

Ψ : Πl(n) → Πl(n),

ψ : I1 → I2,

• λ is a highest weight vertex in Gs1,≤1 if and only if Ψ(λ) is a highest

weight vertex in Gs2,≤2,

• we have an arrow λ

i→ µ in Gs1,≤1 if and only if we have an arrow

Ψ(λ)

ψ(i)
→ Ψ(µ) in Gs2,≤2.

In addition, if Ψ is the identity, we will say that the two graphs are
equivalent (in particular, the graph structures coincide up to their coloring).
We will see that, for a good choice of the orders ≤1 and ≤2, the graphs Gs1,≤1
and Gs2,≤2 have the structure of a Kashiwara crystal graph. In this case,
a crystal isomorphism between Gs1,≤1 and Gs2,≤2 is a graph isomorphism
such that ψ = id. In particular, each crystal isomorphism yields a graph
isomorphism but the converse is false in general.

2.3. Extended JMMO Fock space structure. We now deﬁne a Fock
space structure that, as far as we know, ﬁrst appeared in the work of Gerber
[3]. This structure generalizes the ones deﬁned by Uglov [12] and Jimbo-
Misra-Miwa-Okado (JMMO) [8].

Condition 2.3. We assume in this paragraph that s = (s1, . . . , sl) ∈ Zl and
κ = 1/e where e ∈ N>1 ⊔ {∞}.

Let ge := Uq(csle) be the quantum group of aﬃne type A(1)

e−1 if e is ﬁnite,
otherwise we set g∞ := Uq(sl∞). The associative Q(q)-algebra ge has gener-
ators ei, fi, ti, t−1
(for i = 0, ..., e − 1) and ∂. We refer the reader to [12, §2.1]
for the relations they satisfy (we do not use them in the sequel.) We denote
by U ′
(for i = 0, ..., e − 1). We
write Λi, i = 0, ..., e − 1 for the fundamental weights of ge.

i

q(csle) the subalgebra generated by ei, fi, ti, t−1

i

The Fock space F is the Q(q)-vector space deﬁned as follows:

F = Mn∈Z≥0 Mλ⊢ln

Q(q)λ.

Set I = Z if e = ∞ and I = Z/eZ otherwise.

For any e ∈ N>1 ⊔ {∞}, there is an action of ge on the Fock space F.
This action can be regarded as a generalization of Uglov’s construction [12,
§2.1]. It is deﬁned by using an order on the nodes on the l-partitions with
the same residue modulo e. This order depends on the choice of an l-tuple

CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

of rational numbers m = (m1, . . . , ml). If e is ﬁnite, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l and
N ∈ Z, let us deﬁne

ms,e

i,j,N := {(m1, . . . , ml) ∈ Ql |si − mi − (sj − mj) = N.e}.

If e = ∞, we deﬁne for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l

ms,∞
i,j

:= {(m1, . . . , ml) ∈ Ql |si − mi − (sj − mj) = 0}.

Let Ms,e be the union of the hyperplanes ms,e
i,j,N for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l and
N ∈ Z if e is ﬁnite and ms,∞
for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l if e = ∞. Now consider
i,j
m /∈ Ms,e. Let γ, γ′ be two removable or addable i-nodes of λ for i ∈ Is.
We denote

γ (cid:22)m γ′ def⇐⇒ b − a + mc < b′ − a′ + mc′.

(3)
Thanks to our assumption m /∈ Ms,e, it is easy to verify that the above
deﬁnition indeed deﬁnes a total order on the set of i-nodes of any l-partition.
This thus yields a graph Ge,m,s as in §2.2. It was also proved in [3] that one
can mimic Uglov’s Fock space construction and deﬁne a ge-action on the
Fock space F from any order (cid:22)m. This gives an integrable ge-module that
we denote by Fe,m,s. The submodule generated by the empty l-partition is
then an irreducible highest weight module of weight Λs = Λs1 + · · · + Λsl.

Remark 2.4. Note that the Fock space Fe,m,s depends on the choice of m
(because of the order (cid:22)m) and on the choice of s modulo e (because of the
deﬁnition of the residue of a node). Also in the case where s = (s1, . . . , sl)
and s′ = (s′
j (mod e) for j = 1, . . . , l, the associated
Fock spaces can be identiﬁed and we can write Fe,m,s = Fe,m,s′.
Remark 2.5. The inverse order (cid:22)−
integrable ge-module on F we denote by F −

m of (cid:22)m also yields the structure of an

and ef (cid:22)m

2.4. Relations with JMMO Fock space structure (1). The operators
deﬁned from the order (cid:22)m as in §2.2 coincide in fact with
z
the Kashiwara crystal operators and Ge,m,s or G∞,m,s are the crystal graphs
corresponding to the ge-module structure on our Fock space. To recover
the crystal structure used by Uglov (or the crystal structure introduced by
JMMO), it suﬃces to choose m such that

mc = sc + δc, c = 1, . . . , l,

where e > δ1 > · · · > δl ≥ 0. We will simply denote by Ge,s this JMMO
structure.

Now let us consider m′ /∈ Ms,e. For c = 1, . . . , l, deﬁne δ′

element of {0, 1 . . . , e − 1} which is equivalent to m′
there exists (s′

l) ∈ Zl such that sj ≡ s′

1, . . . s′

j(mod e) and

c to be the unique
c − sc modulo e. Thus

We have

is an isomorphism of ge-modules.
between the crystal Ge,m′,s and the JMMO crystal Ge,σ(s).

It also deﬁnes a crystal isomorphism

This implies that for any m1 /∈ Ms,e and m2 /∈ Ms,e, the Fock spaces
Fe,m1,s and Fe,m2,s are isomorphic. The crystals Ge,m1,s and Ge,m2,s are then
also isomorphic as crystals. This means they are isomorphic in the sense of
§ 2.2 with indexing set Z/eZ and ψ = id. The modules Fe,m1,s and Fe,m2,s
are reducible in general, so such an isomorphism is not unique. However, its
restriction to the connected component of Ge,m1,s with empty highest weight
vertex yields the connected component of Ge,m2,s with empty highest weight
vertex. In the next sections we shall study certain “canonical isomorphisms”
for graphs Ge,m,s deﬁned from a datum s = (κ, s) more general than when
κ = 1

e and s ∈ Zl.

3. Description of the canonical crystal isomorphisms

In this section we assume that s = (κ, s) with κ = 1

e and s ∈ Zl. Then

Ge,m,s is a Kashiwara crystal for any m /∈ Ms,e.

3.1. Crystal isomorphisms. The hyperplanes ms,e
i,j,N divide Rl into cham-
bers. We ﬁrst show that the orders (cid:22)m are the same for all the parameters
m in the same (open) chambers. We also show that one can restrict to a
ﬁnite sets of chambers in order to understand our crystal isomorphisms.

Proposition 3.1. Assume that m1 and m2 are both in the same chamber
with respect to the decomposition in §2.3, then the orders (cid:22)m1 and (cid:22)m2 on
the i-nodes of an arbitrary l-partition coincide.

Proof. Consider γ = (a, b, c) and γ′ = (a′, b′, c′) two distinct i-nodes and
assume we have γ ≺m1 γ′ but γ′ ≺m2 γ. This means that:

b − a + m1,c < b′ − a′ + m1,c′, b − a + m2,c > b′ − a′ + m2,c′

and b − a + sc = b′ − a′ + sc′ + ke with k ∈ Z.

We get b′ − a′ = b − a + sc − sc′ − ke. By replacing b′ − a′ by its expression
in terms of a and b in the ﬁrst above inequality we obtain:

(5)

(sc − m1,c) − (sc′ − m1,c′) > ke,

whereas the second inequality yields:

(6)

(sc − m2,c) − (sc′ − m2,c′) < ke.

This means that m1 and m2 are separated by the aﬃne hyperplane with
equation (sc −mc)−(sc′ −mc′) = ke, so we get the desired contradiction. (cid:3)

CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

Proposition 3.2. Consider a wall ms,e

i,j,N such that:

|N.e + (sj − si)| > n,

and pick two parameters m1 and m2 separated by this wall (and only it)
then the order (cid:22)m1 and (cid:22)m2 are the same on Πl(n).

Proof. Consider γ = (a, b, c) and γ′ = (a′, b′, c′) two distinct i-nodes such
that γ ≺m1 γ′ but γ′ ≺m2 γ. Since we know that m1 and m2 are separated
by the unique wall ms,e
i,j,N . One can assume that c = i and c′ = j and k = N .
We obtain:

but as we have

b − a + si = b′ − a′ + sj + N.e,

|(b − a) − (b′ − a′)| ≤ n,

this leads to a contradiction.

(cid:3)

The above propositions shows that if we choose m1 and m2 such that :
• these parameters belong to the same chamber with respect to the

decomposition in §2.3,

• or satisfy the condition of Proposition 3.2,

then the associated crystal structures are not simply isomorphic but equal.
To investigate our canonical isomorphims, we thus have a ﬁnite set Ms,e
n of
hyperplanes and chambers to consider (depending on n), namely Ms,e
n is the
union of the ms,e
i,j,N for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ l and |N.e + (sj − si)| ≤ n. Indeed, the
canonical isomorphisms we aim to characterize will be equal to the identity if
we stay inside one chamber. So it just remains to understand what happens
when we move from one chamber to another. This is equivalent to describe
the crystal isomorphisms corresponding to the crossings of the walls ms,e
with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ l and |N.e + (sj − si)| ≤ n.

i,j,N

3.2. A combinatorial procedure. We ﬁrst study the case of e = ∞,
deﬁne and describe our canonical crystal isomorphisms. The walls are then
deﬁned as:

ms,∞
i,j

:= {(m1, . . . , ml) ∈ Ql|si − mi − (sj − mj) = 0},

for each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ l. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where l = 2. Set
s = (s1, s2). We wish to describe a crystal isomorphism when we cross a
wall:

m

(s1,s2),∞
1,2

:= {(m1, m2) ∈ Q2|s1 − m1 − (s2 − m2) = 0}.

Let (λ1, λ2) be a bipartition of n and deﬁne d ≥ |s1 − s2| minimal such
d+1−|s1−s2| = 0. To (λ1, λ2), we associate its symbol.

d+1−|s1−s2| = λ2

that λ1

when s2 < s1.

We will write S(λ1, λ2) =(cid:0)L2

L1(cid:1). By deﬁnition of d, the entry in the leftmost

column of S(λ1, λ2) is equal to s2 − d (resp. s1 − d) when s2 ≥ s1 (resp.
s2 < s1). So from S(λ1, λ2) it is easy to obtain s1 and s2 since |s1 − s2| is
the diﬀerence between the lengths of L1 and L2. Once we have S(λ1, λ2)
and (s1, s2), we can recover the bipartition (λ1, λ2). We now deﬁne a new

bipartition (eλ1,eλ2) from its symbol ((cid:0) eL2

eL1(cid:1) as follows.

Suppose ﬁrst s2 ≥ s1. Consider x1 = min{t ∈ L1}. We associate to x1 the
integer y1 ∈ L2 such that

(7)

y1 =(cid:26) max{z ∈ L2 | z ≤ x1} if min{z ∈ L2} ≤ x1,

max{z ∈ L2} otherwise.

We repeat the same procedure to the lines L2 − {y1} and L1 − {x1}. By in-

duction this yields a sequence {y1, ..., yd+1+s1−s2} ⊂ L2. Then we deﬁne eL1
as the line obtained by reordering the integers of {y1, ..., yd+1+s2−s1} and eL2

as the line obtained by reordering the integers of L2 − {y1, ..., yd+1+s1−s2} +
L1 (i.e. by reordering the set obtained by replacing in L2 the entries
y1, ..., yd+1+s1−s2 by those of L1).
Now, suppose s2 < s1. Consider x1 = min{t ∈ L2}. We associate to x1 the
integer y1 ∈ L1 such that

(8)

y1 =(cid:26) min{z ∈ L1 | x1 ≤ z} if max{z ∈ L1} ≥ x1,

min{z ∈ L1} otherwise.

We repeat the same procedure to the lines L1 − {y1} and L2 − {x1} and

obtain a sequence {y1, ..., yd+1+s1−s2} ⊂ C1. Then we deﬁne eL2 as the line
obtained by reordering the integers of {y1, ..., yd+1+s2−s1} and eL1 as the line

obtained by reordering the integers of L1 − {y1, ..., yd+1+s2−s1} + L2.

Example 3.3. Assume (s1, s2) = (0, 3) and consider the bipartition of 38
given by (λ1, λ2) = (6.5.5.4, 5.5.3.3.2). Then d = 7 and:

S(λ1, λ2) =

and ﬁnally (eλ1,eλ2) = (4.4.3.1, 5.5.5.4.4.3). Observe that both (λ1, λ2) and
(eλ1,eλ2) have rank equal to 38.

Remark 3.4. The previous combinatorial procedure is very closed from that
used in [6] corresponding to the combinatorial R-matrix

G∞,(s1,s2) = G∞,s1 ⊗ G∞,s2 ≃ G∞,s2 ⊗ G∞,s1 = G∞,(s2,s1).

The only diﬀerence is that we do not modify here the original multicharge
(s1, s2). This means the above R-matrix is the map
: Π2(n) → Π2(n)
(λ1, λ2)

R∞

(s1,s2)

We proved in [6] it is a rank preserving crystal isomorphism. Also R∞
(s1,s2)
is the unique g∞-crystal isomorphism between the two Fock spaces because
there is no multiplicity into their decomposition in irreducible components
(only in level 2). We also have R∞
(s1,s2) = id
and we can write

(s2,s1) = R∞

(s1,s2) ◦ R∞

(s2,s1) ◦ R∞

7→ (eλ2,eλ1).

where F is the ﬂip involution deﬁned on the set of bipartitions by F (µ1, µ2) =
(µ2, µ1).

(eλ1,eλ2) = F ◦ R∞

(s1,s2)(λ1, λ2)

By using the crystal isomorphism introduced in (4) and the previous re-

mark, we get the following proposition.

deﬁnes a g∞-crystal isomorphism from G∞,m+,s to G∞,m−,s.

(2) We have Φ∞

(s1,s2) and (Φ∞

(s2,s1) ◦ F is a

g∞-crystal isomorphism from G∞,m−,s to G∞,m+,s.

(3) This map Φ∞

(s1,s2) is the unique crystal isomorphism between G∞,m+,s

and G∞,m−,s which preserves the rank of the bipartitions.1

Assume that l ∈ N. To construct a crystal isomorphism between two

G∞,m−,s preserving both the labelling of the arrows and the rank of the bipartitions.

Proof. Set δ = m−s and δ′ = m′ −s. By Proposition 3.1, since we can move
in each chamber without changing the crystal structure we can assume that
δ and δ′ have distinct coordinates. We can also assume that m and m′ are
very closed to each other but belong to distinct half-spaces deﬁned by the
wall m. So the coordinates of δ − δ′ are small and we have δi − δj > 0 and

Let σ be the permutations of {1, . . . , l} corresponding to the decreasing
reordering of δ. One can then choose the coordinates of δ − δ′ suﬃciently
small so that the permutation of {1, . . . , l} yielding the decreasing reordering
of δ′ becomes σ′ = σ1 ◦ (i, j). We then have Φs,∞

We now describe the canonical ge-isomorphisms when e ∈ N is ﬁnite.

Consider a wall:

Assume that m and m′ are separated by this wall (and only it) and that:

Now note that s and es are two multicharges that are equivalent modulo

e. So we have in fact the equalities Ge,m,es = Ge,m,s and Ge,m′,es = Ge,m′,s (see
Remark 2.4). The result follows.
(cid:3)

To simplify, we will denote by Ψs

m,m′ the above bijection obtained by
crossing a single wall when m and m′ satisfy (9). The above result allows to
compute certain ge-crystal isomorphisms between two arbitrary Fock spaces
Fe,m,s and Fe,m′,s by composing the g∞-crystal isomorphisms of Theorem
3.7.

3.3. Detecting the highest weight vertices. Using the work [7], it is
also possible to decide easily whether a multipartition λ = (λ1, . . . , λl) is a
highest weight vertex in Fe,m,s. Such a criterion is available in the case of
the original Uglov structure. Using our discussion in §2.4, we can extend it
to the more general crystal structures we consider here as follows.

Let m′ ∈ Ms,e and consider the permutation σ ∈ Sl and s′ ∈ Zl as deﬁned

in §2.4.

We deﬁne the symbol S(λ) of the l-partition λ for the multicharge s′ by
extending the deﬁnition in §3.2. This is the l-row tableau S(λ) whose j-th
row (the rows are numbered from bottom to top) is :

−u + 1 + λj
s′
j+u

· · ·

· · ·

· · ·

j − 1 + λj
s′
2

j + λj
s′
1

where u is minimal such that λi

= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , l.

u+s′
i

An e-period is a sequence of e boxes (b1, . . . , be) in S(λ) such that

• b1 contains the greatest entry of S(λ), say k,
• for all j = 1, . . . , e the entry in the box bj is k − j + 1,
• if we write c(bj) ∈ {1, 2, . . . , l} for the row of the box bj in S(λ) we

have

σ−1(b1) ≥ σ−1(b2) ≥ · · · ≥ σ−1(be).

When S(λ) admits an e-period, one can delete it in S(λ) and this yields
the symbol of a new l-partition λ♭. We can then apply the same procedure
to S(λ♭) providing it also admits an e-period. This process will eventually
terminate and then, one of the two following situations will happen:

• we ﬁnally get a symbol of the empty l-partition. In that case λ is a

highest weight vertex.

• we get a symbol without e-period which is not a symbol of the empty

l-partition. In that case λ is not a highest weight vertex.

Example 3.8. Take e = 3 and s = (0, 0). Recall the notation of § 2.4.

Assume m′ = (m′

1, m′
(s′

2) = (1, 3). We have
2, δ′
1, δ′

1) = (0, 1), (s′

2) = (3, 0),

12

and σ = Id ∈ S2. For the 2-partition λ =(3.1, 2.2.1.1), we get the following
symbol :

−2 −1 1 2 4 5
−2

3

0

.

We see that we have a 3-period given by the boxes ﬁlled by 5, 4 and 3. By
deleting this period, we obtain the symbol

−2 −1 1 2
−2

0

and ﬁnally

−2 −1
−2

.

with corresponds to the empty bipartition. Hence λ is a highest weight vertex
in G3,(1,3),(0,0).

Now assume m′ = (m′

1, m′

2) = (0, 4). We have

(s′

1, δ′

1) = (0, 0), (s′

2, δ′

2) = (3, 1),

and σ = (1, 2) ∈ S2. For the 2-partition (3.1, 2.2.1.1), the symbol that we
have to consider is the same as above but the deﬁnition of a period is now
twisted by σ. This time, we have no 3-period and λ is no longer a highest
weight vertex in G3,(0,4),(0,0).

Example 3.9. We will here consider the same example as [9, ex 5.6], We
assume that s = (0, 0) and e = 2. We take n = 3. Then we have 3
hyperplanes to consider :

m

(0,0),2
1,2,−1 := {(m1, m2) ∈ Q2 | m2 − m1 = −2},

m

(0,0),2
1,2,0

:= {(m1, m2) ∈ Q2 | m2 − m1 = 0},

m

(0,0),2
1,2,1

:= {(m1, m2) ∈ Q2 | m2 − m1 = 2}.

The 2-partitions of 3 are :

(∅, 1.1.1), (∅, 2.1), (∅, 3), (1, 1.1), (1, 2), (1.1, 1), (1.1.1, ∅), (2, 1), (2.1, ∅), (3, ∅)

Now we pick one parameter in each of the four associated chambers :

(1) Take m[1] = (m1, m2) ∈ Q2 such that m2 − m1 < −2.
(2) Take m[2] = (m1, m2) ∈ Q2 such that 0 > m2 − m1 > −2.
(3) Take m[3] = (m1, m2) ∈ Q2 such that 2 > m2 − m1 > 0.
(4) Take m[4] = (m1, m2) ∈ Q2 such that m2 − m1 > 2.

4. Wall crossing bijections for Cherednik algebras

We now give an interpretation of the above isomorphisms in the context of
rational Cherednik algebras. In [9], Losev has introduced certain combinato-
rial maps between the sets of simple modules in the category O for rational
Cherednik algebras. We are going to explain how these maps (called “wall-
crossing bijections”) are connected with our crystal isomorphisms. We refer
to [10] for more details on the representation theory of Cherednik algebras
and for problems we are interested in this section.

4.1. Rational Cherednik algebras. Let Hκ,s(n) be the rational Chered-
nik algebra associated with the complex reﬂection group of type W :=
G(l, 1, n) acting on h := Cn. As a vector space, this algebra is S(h∗) ⊗
CW ⊗ S(h) (where S(V ) denotes the symmetric algebra of the vector space
V ). It admits a presentation by generators and relations for which we refer
to [5, §2.3].

Importantly, this presentation depends on a parameter s := (κ, s) ∈ C ×
Cl. This parameter is the one used in [9, 10] as well as in [5] (the reader
may look at the relations between the diﬀerent parametrizations given in [5,
§2.3.2])

We will consider the category On,s for this algebra whose simple objects
are parametrized by the set Πl(n), which also index the set of irreducible
representations of the complex reﬂection group W in characteristic 0.

Remark 4.1. An important problem in this theory is to compute the support
of a simple module in the category On,s parametrized by an l-partition λ.
This in particular leads to a classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite dimensional simple
modules in this category.

As explained in [9, §4] and [10, §3.1.3], in most of the questions relative
to the study of the category O we can assume (and we will do in the sequel)
the following condition is satisﬁed.

Condition 4.2. In the rest of the paper we assume that:

14

NICOLAS JACON AND C´EDRIC LECOUVEY

(1) κ = r
prime,

e is a positive rational number where r and e are relatively

(2) r.sj ∈ Z for any j = 1, . . . , l.

In particular, we have now s := (κ, s) ∈ Q × Ql. Let us denote by S the

subset of Q × Ql satisfying (1) and (2).

In [11], Shan has introduced an action of the quantum group ge on a
Fock space deﬁned from a categorical action on the direct sum over n of the
categories On,s. This action heavily depends on the choice of the parameter
s. It also induces a structure of ge-crystal on the set of l-partitions. This
crystal structure can be deﬁned by using a relevant total order ≤ on z-nodes
as we did in Section 2.2. Consider γ = (a, b, c) and γ′ = (a′, b′, c′) two such
z-nodes.

Deﬁnition 4.3. We set γ ≤ γ′ if and only if

κl(b − a + sc) − c ≤ κl(b′ − a′ + sc′) − c′.

The associated oriented graph is denoted by Gs with indexing set Is.

Observe this is indeed a total order since the equality

κl(b − a + sc) − c = κl(b′ − a′ + sc′) − c′,

implies that l divides c − c′. But 0 ≤ |c − c′| < l so we have in fact c = c′
and γ = γ′. We are going to see that the graph structure Gs coincides
with a graph structure already deﬁned which is a crystal structure up to
reparametrization of the colors. Since r and e are relatively prime, we have
eZ + rZ = Z and eZ ∩ rZ = erZ. Then, for any integer a there exists a
unique pair (c, d) such that a = ed + rc and c ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1}. Since we have
rsj ∈ Z for any j = 1, . . . , l, we can set:

(10)
where cj ∈ {0, . . . , e−1}. Note then that cj is equivalent to sj modulo κ−1Z.
Recall Deﬁnition 2.2. We have the following elementary lemma.

rsj = edj + rcj,

Lemma 4.4. The map

ψ :

is well deﬁned and is a bijection

i(mod e)

Z/eZ → Is

7→ i(mod κ−1Z)

Proof. Assume i1 and i2 are such that i1 = i2(mod e) and set i1 = i2 + ae
with a ∈ Z. Then i1 = i2 + arκ−1 since κ = r
e thus i1 = i2(mod κ−1Z) and
ψ is well-deﬁned from Z/eZ to Q/κ−1Z. Now we can write any i ∈ Z on the
form i = (i − s1) + s1. So ψ(Z/eZ) ⊂ Is (see Deﬁnition 2.2). Conversely, for
any integer x and any j = 1, . . . , l, we have

x + sj(mod κ−1Z) = x + cj(mod κ−1Z)

so that ψ(x + cj(mod e)) = x + sj(mod κ−1Z) and ψ is surjective. Finally
assume ψ(i1(mod e)) = ψ(i2(mod e)). This implies that i1 − i2 belongs to

CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

15

κ−1Z = e
and i1 − i2 is an integer.

r Z. So i1 − i2 belongs to eZ because e and r are relatively prime
(cid:3)

For j = 1, . . . , l write also

mj = sj −

j
κl

= sj −

je
rl

∈ Q,

and set m = (m1, . . . , ml) ∈ Ql.

4.2. Relation with extended JMMO Fock space structure (2). In
the following proposition, we will consider the oriented graph Gs with index-
ing set Is and the crystal graph Ge,m,c which indexing set is Z/eZ.

Proposition 4.5. The colored oriented graph Gs is equivalent to the crystal
Ge,m,c. More precisely, we have an isomorphism of oriented graphs θ between
Ge,m,c and Gs and according to the notation of §2.2, the following maps :

Ψ Πl(n) → Πl(n)

λ

7→ λ

ψ

,

Z/eZ → Is

i(mod e)

7→ i(mod κ−1Z).

Proof. First, we show that two boxes have the same residue for (κ, s) if and
only they have the same residue for (1/e, c). This follows from the fact that,
for two nodes (x, y, i) and (x′, y′, j) of an l-partition, we have

if and only if

x − y + si = x′ − y′ + sj + κ−1Z

r(x − y + si) = r(x′ + y′ + sj) + eZ,

because κ = r

e . By using (10) we get

r(x − y + ci) = r(x′ + y′ + cj) + eZ.

Now both (x − y + ci) and (x′ + y′ + cj) are integers. As (e, r) = 1, we have

x − y + ci = x′ + y′ + cj + eZ,

which is what we wanted to show. Observe also that the residue of (x, y, i)
for (1/e, c) and (κ, s) are respectively equal to

(x − y + ci)(mode) and (x − y + si)(modκ−1Z),

and we have

(x − y + ci) ≡ (x − y + si)(modκ−1Z).

It just remains to show that the order ≤ on z-nodes corresponds to the

order (cid:22)m.

Let γ = (x, y, i) and γ′ = (x′, y′, j) be two nodes of the l-partition. Then

we have the equivalences

γ ≤ γ′ ⇐⇒ κ(x − y + sc) −

c
l

= κ(x′ − y′ + sc′) −

c′
l

⇐⇒ x − y + mi ≤ x′ − y′ + mj.

which is exactly what we wanted.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.6. Combining this proposition with the results in §3.3, we ob-
tain a criterion to decide whether an l-partition is a highest weight in Gs.
The ﬁnite dimensional modules in the associated category O of the Chered-
nik algebra are in particular parametrized by l-partitions which satisfy this
criterion. We refer to [4] for other results in this direction and a detailed
investigation of the crystal action of the Heisenberg algebra on Gs which also
appears in the study of this problem.

Let us now review the wall crossing bijections. Fix n ∈ N. In the set of
parameters S, one can deﬁne certain hyperplanes called essential walls. Set

hj = κmj = κsj − j/l, j = 1, . . . , l.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Recall n is ﬁxed. Given i, j distinct in {1, . . . , l}, the es-
sential wall parametrized by (i, j) is the set of parameters s = (κ, s) ∈ S
such that there exists an integer a satisfying:

(1) |a| < n,
(2) mi − mj = a,
(3) si − sj − a ∈ κ−1Z.

Consider two parameters s = (κ, s) and s′ = (κ′, s′) in S satisfying :

(11)

κ − κ′ ∈ Z and ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , l} κsj − κ′s′

j ∈ Z

and such that s and s′ are separated by one essential wall.

Remark 4.8. Assume s and s′ satisfy (11). This means that there exist
k ∈ Z and t ∈ Z such that r′s′

j = rsj + ke and r′ = r + t.e.
By (10), for each j = 1, . . . , l, there exists a unique (cj , c′

j) ∈ {0, . . . , e −

1}2 and (dj, d′

j) ∈ Z2 such that

rsj = edj + rcj, r′s′

j = ed′

j + r′c′
j.

We obtain:

r′s′

j = rsj + ke

We thus have c′

j = cj and d′

= edj + rcj + ke
= edj + r′cj − tecj + ke
= e(dj − te + k) + r′cj.
j = dj − te + k.

By Proposition 4.5 Gs and Gs′ are respectively isomorphic to Ge,m,c and
Ge,m′,c for good choices of m and m′. But Ge,m′,c and Ge,m,c are isomorphic
as crystal graphs because the associated Fock spaces have the same multi-
charge. So Gs and Gs′ are isomorphic as soon as s and s′ satisfy (11).

In [9, Prop. 5.9], Losev deﬁnes a bijection wcs→s′ between l-partitions

which is an isomorphism of graphs in the sense of §2.2.

Proposition 4.9. Given s and s′ in S satisfying (11) and separated by the
essential wall parametrized by (i, j), there is a bijection wcs→s′ on the set of
l-partitions such that if µ = wcs→s′(λ) we have

CRYSTAL ISOMORPHISMS AND WALL CROSSING MAPS

• λk = µk if k 6= i and k 6= j,
• (µi, µj) = wc(κ,si,sj)→(κ′,s′
i,s′

j)(λi, λj)

where wc(κ,si,sj)→(κ′,s′

j) is the unique graph isomorphism between Gs and
Gs′ preserving both the labelling of the arrows and the rank of the bipartitions.

i,s′

Let us look at the essential hyperplanes and check that they are the same
as the ones deﬁne in §2.3. Assume that we are in an essential hyperplane.
This implies that there exists a ∈ Z such that

si − sj − a ∈ κ−1Z

and

mi − mj = e.a.

Thus there exists x ∈ Z such that si − sj = a + κ−1x. We obtain:

e(di − dj − x) = r(cj − ci + a).

This implies that cj − ci = a + eZ because e and r are relatively prime.
Thus, we have :

cj − mj − (ci − mi) ∈ eZ.

Conversely, if we have that cj − mj − (ci − mi) = eN with N ∈ Z with the
above relation between the parameters. We obtain that

mi − mj = ci − cj + eN.

Let us then set a = ci − cj + eN which is in Z. Now by (10) we have
si = κ−1di + ci and sj = κ−1dj + cj. We thus get

si − sj − a = κ−1(di − dj) + (ci − cj) − a = κ−1(di − dj + rN ) ∈ κ−1Z.
We now want to check that the wall crossing bijections correspond to our

bijections deﬁned in §3.2.

Theorem 4.10. The wall crossing bijection wcs→s′ corresponds to Ψc

m,m′.
m,m′ modify the component of indices i and
Proof. Since both wcs→s′ and Ψc
j in the l-partition it suﬃces to show that for any bipartition (λ1, λ2) we have
j)(λi, λj) = Ψ(ci,cj)
wc(κ,si,sj)→(κ′,s′
i,s′
j)
and Ψ(ci,cj)
j) are graph isomorphisms which preserve the labelling of
the arrows and the rank of the bipartitions. Since there is only one such
isomorphism, they coincide.

i,m′

Remark 4.11. Assume now s := (κ, s) where κ is a rational negative
number. To each l-partition λ = (λ1, . . . , λl) we associate its conjugate
λ# = ((λl)#, . . . , (λ1)#) where (λc)# is the conjugate of the partition λc for
any k = 1, . . . , l. There is a natural bijection between the nodes of λ and λ#
which maps γ = (a, b, c) ∈ λ on γ# = (b, a, l − c). Set s# := (−κ, s#) where
s# = (−sl, . . . , −s1). The map # then deﬁnes an anti-isomorphism from
the graphs Gs to Gs# which sends each l-partition λ on λ# and each arrow
z→ µ on λ# −z→ µ#. This implies that the wall crossing maps for κ and
λ
−κ coincide up to conjugation by #.
