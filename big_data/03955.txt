MULTIDIMENSIONAL STABILITY OF LARGE-AMPLITUDE

NAVIER–STOKES SHOCKS

JEFFREY HUMPHERYS, GREGORY LYNG, AND KEVIN ZUMBRUN

Abstract. Extending results of Humpherys-Lyng-Zumbrun in the one-dimensional case,
we use a combination of asymptotic ODE estimates and numerical Evans-function com-
putations to examine the multidimensional stability of planar Navier–Stokes shocks across
the full range of shock amplitudes, including the inﬁnite-amplitude limit, for monatomic or
diatomic ideal gas equations of state and viscosity and heat conduction coeﬃcients µ, µ + η,
and ν = κ/cv in the physical ratios predicted by statistical mechanics, with Mach number
M > 1.035. Our results indicate unconditional stability within the parameter range consid-
ered; this agrees with the results of Erpenbeck and Majda for the corresponding inviscid case
of Euler shocks. Notably, this study includes the ﬁrst successful numerical computation of an
Evans function associated with the multidimensional stability of a viscous shock wave. The
methods introduced may be used in principle to decide stability for any γ-law gas, γ > 1,
and arbitrary µ > |η| ≥ 0, ν > 0 or, indeed, for shocks of much more general models and
equations, including in particular viscoelasticity, combustion, and magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD).

1. Introduction

In this paper—extending to multiple space dimensions results of Humpherys-Laﬁtte-
Zumbrun [41] and Humpherys-Lyng-Zumbrun [38] in the one-dimensional case—we address
by a combination of numerical and analytical methods the long-standing question of stabil-
ity of Navier–Stokes shock waves for a polytropic equation of state with shock amplitude
not necessarily small. Remarkably, by a rescaling/compactiﬁcation argument as in [38], we
are able to obtain uniform estimates independent of shock amplitude, including the inﬁnite-
amplitude limit, obtaining convincing numerical evidence that for a monatomic or diatomic
ideal gas equation of state and viscosity and heat conduction coeﬃcients in the physical ra-
tios predicted by statistical mechanics, Navier–Stokes shocks are multidimensionally stable,
independent of amplitude or other parameters.

This conﬁrms the predictions of the inviscid Euler case, for which the corresponding result
was established by Erpenbeck and Majda [21, 55]. The treatment of the multidimensional
case involves substantial new technical diﬃculties, both numerical and analytical, beyond
that of the one-dimensional case. Indeed, this study includes the ﬁrst successful numerical
Evans-function computations for multidimensional stability of a viscous shock wave of any
type.

1.1. Background and description of main results. Stability is a fundamental issue in
the study of shock waves. Indeed, one of their deﬁning features is the ability to transmit large
amounts of energy over large distances in the form of a coherent wave front. The mathe-
matical study of shock stability, connected with properties of compressibility, initially lagged
behind the study of other forms of hydrodynamic stability connected with incompressible
ﬂow, partly perhaps due to complexity of the problem and partly perhaps because shocks
under most circumstances are extremely stable [14]. However, since its rigorous formulation
by Erpenbeck [21] and others in the 1960’s, the problem of shock stability has been the
object of intensive investigation by a number of diﬀerent authors. We mention in particular
the “inviscid” studies of Erpenbeck, Majda, and Metivier [21, 52, 53, 54, 57], largely settling
the question in the case where second-order transport eﬀects of viscosity, heat conduction,
magnetic resistivity, etc. are neglected, and their striking corollary, “Majda’s Theorem:”
for a polytropic ideal gas equation of state, inviscid shock waves are spectrally and nonlinearly
stable, independent of shock amplitude, in one and multiple space dimensions.1

The above-mentioned inviscid studies concern discontinuous solutions of systems of ﬁrst-
order quasilinear hyperbolic conservation laws, which are constant to either side of the shock
front. When transport eﬀects are included, the structure becomes more complicated, with
the shock discontinuity replaced by a smooth but rapidly varying “shock layer” joining
asymptotically constant states at inﬁnity. In most cases, the proﬁle of this shock layer is
not explicitly known, but only guaranteed by abstract theory to exist. For treatments of the
shock structure problem, see for example the studies of Bethe [18] in the inviscid setting,
and Weyl [77] and Gilbarg [25] in the “viscous,” or Navier–Stokes case.2

The study of stability of viscous shock layers, was initiated at the one-dimensional scalar
level by Hopf [34] and Il’in-Ole˘inik [42]. For one-dimensional systems, it was begun in
the 1980’s by Kawashima-Matsumura, Kawashima-Matsumua-Nishihara, Liu, and Goodman
[46, 47, 50, 26, 27], and essentially concluded in [73, 51, 24, 82, 61, 62, 63, 39, 41, 38, 37, 67].
We note in particular the proof by Mascia-Zumbrun and Humpherys-Zumbrun [62, 39] for the
ﬁrst time of small-amplitude (one-dimensional) stability of ordinary gas-dynamical and Lax-
type magnetohydrodynamic Navier–Stokes shocks with general equation of state, and the
proof by Mascia-Zumbrun and Raooﬁ-Zumbrun [63, 67] of nonlinear (one-dimensional) sta-
bility of large-amplitude shock solutions of arbitrary type for a class of systems generalizing
the Kawashima class [44, 45], including gas dynamics, viscoelasticity, and magnetohydrody-
namics (MHD), assuming a numerically veriﬁable Evans-function condition encoding spectral
stability in an appropriate sense; that is, the Evans-function condition accounts for the lack
of spectral gap/accumulating essential spectrum at the origin that is an fundamental feature
of the shock stability problem.3 Finally, we note the analytical/numerical studies in [41]
and [38], Humpherys-Laﬁtte-Zumbrun and Humpherys-Lyng-Zumbrun, respectively, verify-
ing spectral and nonlinear stability of arbitrary amplitude polytropic ideal gas shock layers
for the isentropic and non-isentropic Navier–Stokes equations with gas constant γ ∈ [1.2, 3].
The study of multidimensional viscous stability for scalar equations was initiated by Good-
man [28] for small-amplitude shocks, and extended to large amplitudes by Goodman-Miller

1Shown by Erpenbeck [21] at the level of spectral stability; see also the one-dimensional investigations of

Lax [48].

and Hoﬀ-Zumbrun [29, 35, 36]. The study of multidimensional stability for systems, requiring
substantially new ideas beyond those of the scalar case, was initiated by Zumbrun-Serre and
Zumbrun in [83, 78] with various important extensions carried out by Freist¨uhler-Szmolyan,
Zumbrun, and Nguyen, respectively, in [23, 79, 80, 64]. The current state of the art as
regards multidimensional stability for viscous shock layers of the Navier-Stokes equations
and related physical systems is that generalized spectral stability, as represented by an ap-
propriate Evans-function condition, is suﬃcient (and with further elaboration, essentially
necessary as well [81]) for nonlinear asymptotic stability with explicit time-algebraic rates
of decay in Lp, p ≥ 2; see [79, 64]. For analogous results on the associated inviscid limit
problem, see [30].

At an abstract level, this is completely parallel to the inviscid theory, where nonlinear sta-
bility reduces to a generalized spectral stability condition phrased in terms of a Lopatinski
determinant analogous to the Evans function. Indeed, the Lopatinski condition of inviscid
theory may be shown to be the low-frequency limit of the Evans function of the viscous
theory [83, 78]. However, unlike the Lopatinski determinant, which, being associated with a
constant-coeﬃcient problem, is explicitly computable in terms of the endstates of the shock,
the Evans function, determined by solution of a variable-coeﬃcient system of ordinary diﬀer-
ential equations (ODEs), is almost never explicitly computable, except in certain asymptotic
limits. In fact, up to the time of this writing, the multidimensional Evans condition had not
been veriﬁed to our knowledge either analytically or numerically for any single viscous shock
wave.

The question we consider here is whether Majda’s Theorem—evidently a condition on
low-frequency stability—extends to a corresponding result of full multidimensional viscous
stability. Our main result is to show, by numerically well-conditioned and analytically jus-
tiﬁed computations that in fact an analogous result does hold for the viscous case, at least
for a γ-law gas with γ = 5/3 or γ = 7/5, corresponding to a monatomic or diatomic gas,
and Mach number M ≥ 1.035 not too close to the small-amplitude limit M = 1.0.

In passing, we develop a number of new techniques to deal with diﬃculties special to
the multidimensional case, in particular: (i) a ﬂexible yet sharp “high-frequency tracking”
algorithm allowing us to obtain reasonable bounds on the size of possible unstable fre-
quencies/eigenvalues while maintaining reasonable computational expense; (ii) a “modiﬁed
balanced ﬂux” coordinatization of the Evans function analogous to the integrated coordi-
nates of one-dimensional theory, namely, factoring out zeros at the origin while maintaining
analyticity in the temporal frequency λ; and (iii) a “pseudo-Lagrangian” change of indepen-
dent variable factoring out excessive variation arising in the Eulerian coordinates natural for
the multidimensional problem. These appear to be necessary even to carry out successful
Evans-function computations for a single wave of moderate amplitude; see [11, 12] for further
discussion.

1.2. Discusion and open problems. Our results extend and complete the earlier one-
dimensional investigations of [38]. A remarkable feature of both analyses is that we are
able to treat simultaneously all possible shock amplitudes, making use of invariance of the
polytropic Navier–Stokes equations, by a rescaling/compactiﬁcation argument. Speciﬁcally,
rescaling so that the both the density at the left endstate ρ− and the shock speed s in La-
grangian coordinates (resp., mass ﬂux m in Eulerian coordinates) be one, we ﬁnd that all
gas-dynamical quantities in the proﬁle and eigenvalue ODEs remain bounded and bounded

4

away from zero, save for internal energy at the left endstate e−, which approaches the non-
physical value zero in the inﬁnite-(non-rescaled) amplitude limit.

Noting that all coeﬃcients remain smooth (indeed, analytic) for e = 0, and checking by
special structure of the equations that stable/unstable subspaces of the limiting eigenvalue
ODEs at spatial inﬁnity have continuous limits as e− → 0, so that we can make sense of the
notion of extended eigenvalue there in a way that perturbs smoothly, we are able to adjoin
the limiting value e− = 0 corresponding to inﬁnite shock amplitude to the computational
domain, thus obtaining a compact parameter space on which we can carry out uniformly
well-conditioned computations.

A substantial diﬃculty, however, is that for e = 0 the ﬁrst-order hyperbolic (Euler)
part of the Navier–Stokes equations is no longer symmetrizable. As a result, the stan-
dard “Kawashima-type” hyperbolic–parabolic energy estimates that have been used in [80]
and elsewhere to bound the size of possible unstable frequencies/eigenvalues no longer apply,
and we must appeal to more special and/or complicated methods to bound uniformly the
range of frequencies under consideration. Here, we follow a “tracking” argument similar to
that used in [38], based on invariant cones and Ricatti-type energy estimates generalizing
those of [24, 82] in the strictly parabolic case,4 in which the equations are conjugated by a
series of transformations to an equivalent partially symmetrized form in which stable and
unstable subspaces have not only a spectral gap but a gap in numerical range.

A new diﬃculty in the multidimensional case is that there are multiple scaling regimes
for the eigenstructure of the asymptotic eigenvalue problem, and so these transformations
do not lend themselves to the type of series expansion that was carried out in [38], nor is
the symmetrization step readily carried out by hand. We replace these steps therefore with
a more general approach in which these steps are replaced by numerical computations; the
resulting algorithm, described in Appendix A, both clariﬁes and greatly extends that of [38].
A further diﬃculty of the multidimensional case is the unavailability of the “integrated”
coordinates of the one-dimensional case, which have the desirable property of factoring out
eigenvalues at the origin while maintaining analyticity of the eigenvalue ODE (hence also
the associated Evans function) with respect to the spectral parameter λ. As noted earlier,
we overcome this by the introduction of a new “modiﬁed balanced ﬂux” coordinatization
that shares these properties.

A ﬁnal new aspect is practical unavailability of Lagrangian coordinates in the multidimen-
sional stability problem. Though Lagrangian coordinates may be introduced, at the expense
of carrying d2 − 1 additional variables, where d the spatial dimension, corresponding to the
d2 entries of the stress tensor, they introduce a massive ambiguity in the equations due to the
inﬁnite-dimensional family of invariances corresponding to volume-preserving maps of the
spatial variable; see [66] for further discussion. This results in an inﬁnite-dimensional family
of spurious pure imaginary essential spectra complicating both the stability problem and
potential construction of an Evans function. On the other hand, it turns out that the usual
construction of the Evans function, in Eulerian coordinates, has asymptotic behavior yielding
unacceptably large variation at high frequencies. Indeed, we ﬁnd it practically incomputable,
except at small frequencies. We remedy this by a change of the independent spatial variable
x1 to its corresponding value in the one-dimensional Lagrangian representation. Remarkably,

4 See also [31] for links to a type of Kreiss symmetrizer estimate introduced in [59].

5

by this simple “pseudo-Lagrangian” coordinatization we recover the favorable asymptotics
of the one-dimensional Lagrangian case, and practically feasible computations [11].

These innovations not only make possible the uniform treatment of large-amplitude Navier–
Stokes shocks, but also for the ﬁrst time practical multidimensional stability computations
in a variety of diﬀerent settings. Two particularly interesting directions for further in-
vestigation are viscous MHD shocks and detonations, for both of which instabilities are
known to occur, with interesting associated bifurcations, and for which the eﬀects of vis-
cosity are as yet unclear [60, 66, 74, 75, 69, 81, 13]. A related direction for study is on
the possible relation between types of instabilities and an associated convex entropy; see
[4, 49, 76] for related one-dimensional investigations. The study of large-amplitude stability
for temperature-dependent transport coeﬃcients, or kinetic models, are further interesting
directions.

Another interesting open problem is stability of Navier–Stokes shocks in the small-amplitude
limit: this “characteristic” limit is not accessible to direct numerical investigation, but should
be possible (both analytically and numerically) by the singular perturbation/asymptotic
ODE techniques used here and in [22, 23, 65, 41, 38, 6]. For a treatment of the multidimen-
sional problem in the artiﬁcial (Laplacian) viscosity case, see [23]. See [65] for a treatment
of the partially parabolic and related relaxation case in one dimension.

Finally, we emphasize that, though our computations here are numerically well-conditioned
and based on rigorous theory, they constitute convincing numerical evidence and not rigor-
ous numerical proof. To convert the present analysis to numerical proof based on interval
arithmetic is an interesting open problem, involving separate and interesting issues of feasible
computation, and, given the fundamental nature of the problem, certainly seems warranted.
The successful work of Barker [3] in a related context serves as a proof of concept in this
regard.

1.3. Plan of the Paper. In Sections 2 and 3, we present the Navier–Stokes and shock
proﬁle equations, then, in Subsections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, our choice of rescaled coordinates
and uniform existence/decay of shock proﬁles. In Sections 4 and 5 we derive the linearized
eigenvalue ODE, and carry out the construction of the Evans function in balanced ﬂux
coordinates.

In Section 6, we carry out the key high-frequency tracking analysis uniformly bounding
the frequency domain under consideration. In Section 7, we carry out a low-frequency Evans
function analysis using the balanced ﬂux formulation, establishing stability for frequencies
suﬃciently near zero. Finally, in Section 8, we carry out a large-scale intermediate frequency
Evans function analysis using a combination of standard and modiﬁed balanced ﬂux formu-
lations together with pseudo-Lagrangian coordinates, verifying stability on the remaining
frequency regimes. We summarize the argument in Section 9, concluding that Navier–Stokes
shocks are stable for monatomic and diatomic ideal gas equations of state and Mach number
M > 1.035. Various useful tools and auxiliary materials are collected in the appendices.

independently intermediate-frequency computations and in numerous useful discussions.

2. Compressible Navier–Stokes equations

Before starting, we make the standard observation [21, 52] that, by rotational invariance
of the Navier–Stokes equations, together with the assumed rotational symmetry (since con-
stant) of a planar shock wave in transverse directions (i.e., transverse to the direction of
propagation), it is suﬃcient in the study of spectral stability to restrict to the case of dimen-
sion two. Speciﬁcally, taking the Fourier transform in transverse directions, and denoting
the resulting frequency as ξ, one ﬁnds that the eigenvalue equations depend only on |ξ|,
hence reduce to the two-dimensional case. Thus, there is no loss of generality in restricting
to two dimensions, as we hereafter do. In Eulerian coordinates, the Navier–Stokes equations
for compressible gas dynamics in two spatial dimensions can be written in the form

ρt + (ρu)x1 + (ρv)x2 = 0,

(ρu)t + (ρu2 + p)x1 + (ρuv)x2 = (2µ + η)ux1x1 + µux2x2 + (µ + η)vx1x2,

(ρv)t + (ρuv)x1 + (ρv2 + p)x2 = µvx1x1 + (2µ + η)vx2x2 + (µ + η)ux2x1,

where ρ is density, u and v are the ﬂuid velocities in x1 and x2 directions respectively, p is
pressure, and the speciﬁc energy E is made up of the speciﬁc internal energy e and kinetic
energy:

(2.2)
The constants µ > |η| ≥ 0 and κ > 0 are coeﬃcients of ﬁrst (“dynamic”) and second viscosity
and heat conductivity. Finally, T is the temperature, and we assume that the speciﬁc internal
energy e and the pressure p are known functions of density and temperature:

E = e +

(2.3)

p = p0(ρ, T ),

e = e0(ρ, T ).

Remark 2.1. In our use of (2.3) to close the system (2.1), we are assuming, following the
terminology of Menikoﬀ and Plohr [56] (see also the discussion in [17]), that the ﬂuid is
endowed with a complete equation of state. In their framework, the speciﬁc internal energy
is given everywhere as a function of the speciﬁc volume τ = 1/ρ (we use τ to avoid a
notational conﬂict with v which we are using to denote velocity) and the speciﬁc entropy S:

Then, the pressure p and the temperature T are obtained from the state equation via

e = e(τ, S).

An important special case occurs when we consider a polytropic ideal gas. In this case

the energy and pressure functions take the speciﬁc form

(2.4)

p0(ρ, T ) = RρT,

e0(ρ, T ) = cvT,

where the gas constant, R > 0, and the speciﬁc heat at constant volume, cv > 0, are constants
that depend on the gas [72].

Alternatively, we may use (2.4) to write the pressure in terms of the density and the

speciﬁc internal energy as

p = Γρe,

(2.5)
= γ − 1 > 0 and γ = cp/cv ≥
where the Gruneisen coeﬃcient Γ is given by Γ := R
cv
1 is the adiabatic exponent, which, in the polytropic setting, is the ratio of speciﬁc heat
at constant pressure cp to speciﬁc heat at constant volume cv. Equivalently, p(ρ, S) =
aeS/cv ργ, a = constant, where S is thermodynamical entropy, or p(ρ) = aργ in the isentropic
approximation; see [72, 9, 41].

Remark 2.2. In the literature, a gas satisfying the pressure law

p = (γ − 1)ρe

is commonly referred to as a “γ-law” gas. The main calculations of this paper will be in the
setting of polytropic ideal gas. That is, we use (2.4) to close the system (2.1).

In the thermodynamical rariﬁed gas approximation, γ > 1 is the average over constituent
particles of γ = (N + 2)/N , where N is the number of internal degrees of freedom of
an individual particle, or, for molecules with “tree” (as opposed to ring, or other more
complicated) structure,

(2.6)

γ =

2n + 3
2n + 1

,

where n is the number of constituent atoms [16]: γ = 5/3 for monatomic, γ = 7/5 for
diatomic gas. For dense ﬂuids, γ is typically determined phenomenologically [33]. In general,
γ is usually taken within 1 ≤ γ ≤ 3 in models of gas- or ﬂuid-dynamical ﬂow, whether
phenomenological or derived by statistical mechanics [72, 70, 71].

The dynamic viscosity µ is the constant of proportionality asserted in Newton’s law of
viscosity between shear stress and velocity gradient of a shear ﬂow. This is readily measured,
and is the value usually reported physical tables. For an ideal gas, values of the second
viscosity η are less clear [68]. For incompressible ﬂows, a common assumption is η = 0. For
compressible ﬂows, a common assumption is

(2.7)

η = −(2/3)µ,

8

which amounts to the assumption that pressure is equal to “mean pressure” deﬁned as one-
third the trace of the ﬂuid-dynamical stress tensor, and which seems to agree well with
experiment at least for monatomic and diatomic gases; in particular, η is typically negative
[16, 68].

Heat conductivity κ is related to µ by the dimensionless ratio

(2.8)

Pr := cpµ/κ,

or Prandtl number, which is predicted (somewhat less successfully than Γ, γ) in the statistical
mechanical ideal gas theory by Eucken’s formula [20]

(2.9)

Pr =

4γ
9γ − 5

,

The key parameter ν := κ/cv arising in our analysis thus satisﬁes

(2.10)

ν/µ = γ/Pr,

with a theoretically predicted value (from (2.9)) of
9γ − 5

constants, are

3. Viscous shock profiles

3.1. Traveling-wave equation. A viscous shock proﬁle of (2.1) is a traveling-wave solution,

(3.1)

(ρ, u, v, T )(x, t) = (ˆρ, ˆu, ˆv, ˆT )(x1 − st)

moving with speed s and connecting constant states (ρ±, u±, v±, T±). By Galilean invariance,
we may take without loss of generality a standing shock proﬁle, s = 0, as we shall do
hereafter, to obtain the system of standing-wave ODEs (primes denote diﬀerentiation with
respect to x1)

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.2c)

(ρu)(cid:48) = 0 ,

(ρu2)(cid:48) + p(cid:48) = (2µ + η)u(cid:48)(cid:48) ,

(ρuv)(cid:48) = µv(cid:48)(cid:48) ,

(ρuE)(cid:48) + (pu)(cid:48) = (2µ + η)(uu(cid:48))(cid:48) + κT (cid:48)(cid:48) + µ(vv(cid:48))(cid:48) .

(3.2d)
From the ﬁrst equation m := ρu ≡ constant, hence the third equation becomes mv(cid:48) = µv(cid:48)(cid:48),
for which the only bounded solutions are v ≡ constant. Without loss of generality (by
Galilean coordinate change if necessary), we take v ≡ 0, yielding
(3.3a)

mu(cid:48) + p(cid:48) = (2µ + η)u(cid:48)(cid:48) ,

(3.3b)

mE(cid:48) + (pu)(cid:48) = (2µ + η)(uu(cid:48))(cid:48) + κT (cid:48)(cid:48) .

Integrating from −∞ to x1 and rearranging, we obtain the ﬁrst-order system

which may be closed through the relation ρ = mu−1. Specialized to the ideal gas case,

e(ρ, T ) = ε−2m−2e0(ε−1ρ, ε2m2T ) ;

in the ideal gas case, the pressure and internal energy laws remain unchanged

(3.9)

p(ρ, T ) = RρT,

e(ρ, T ) = cvT,

with the same constants R, cv. Likewise, Γ remains unchanged in (2.5), for any ε, m > 0.

From now on, we restrict to the ideal gas case, and we choose ε and m so that ρ− = 1 and
u− = 1. (To put things another way, we choose m = ˆm := ˆρˆu as the constant of integration
for the (non-rescaled) proﬁle ODE, thus normalizing to m = 1 in rescaled coordinates.)
Setting ν := κ/cv, changing to e-coordinates, and noting that m = 1 after rescaling, we ﬁnd
that system (3.5) becomes, simply,

In (3.11), the square brackets denote the diﬀerence (jump) between end states. That is, if h
is some function of ρ, u and e, then

[h(ρ, u, e)] = h(ρ+, u+, e+) − h(ρ−, u−, e−).

10

By the chosen rescaling, m := (ρu)± = 1, ρ− = u− = 1. Fixing Γ > 0, and letting u+ vary in
the physical range 1 ≥ u+ ≥ u∗(Γ) := Γ/(Γ + 2) (we will show below that this is the physical
range), we use (3.11a)–(3.11c) to solve for

In particular, for γ bounded away from one (equivalently, Γ bounded from zero) u remains
bounded from zero, so that proﬁle equations (3.10) remain smooth with respect to all vari-
ables.5

5 This is essentially diﬀerent from the situation of the isentropic case, which is singular in the strong shock

limit [9, 41, 10].

11

3.4. Existence and decay of proﬁles. We recall from [38] the following lemma describing
the nature of the shock proﬁle.

Lemma 3.1 (Humpherys et al. [38]). For Γ bounded and bounded away from the nonphysical
limit Γ = 0, µ, µ + η, ν bounded and bounded from zero, and u+ bounded away from the
characteristic limit u+ = u− = 1, proﬁles (ˆu, ˆe) of the rescaled equations (3.10) exist for all
1 ≥ u+ ≥ u∗, decaying exponentially to their end states (u±, e±) as x → ±∞, uniformly in
Γ, u+, µ, η, ν.
Proof. As observed in [38], the argument of Gilbarg [25] for ﬁnite-amplitude shocks, 1 ≥
u+ > u∗, applies also in the limiting case u+ = u∗, to yield existence on the whole parameter
range with density ˆρ bounded uniformly above and below. Uniform exponential decay then
follows from the corresponding result established in Lagrangian coordinates in [38], together
with the fact that the Lagrangian spatial variable ˜x is related to the Eulerian variable x by
d˜x/dx = ˆρ−1, hence |˜x|/C ≤ |x| ≤ C|˜x| for uniform C > 0.

For compactness of notation, set

˜µ = (2µ + η),

ˆp = Γˆρˆe.

Specializing to the ideal gas case, linearizing about the stationary solution (ˆρ, ˆu, ˆv, ˆe) and tak-
ing the Fourier transform in the x2 direction, we obtain (recalling that ˆv ≡ 0) the generalized
eigenvalue equations

Deﬁning W := (w, ˜x, y, ˜z, u, v, e)T , using ˆu−1 ≡ ˆρ, and rearranging, we may express (4.5)

5.1. Balanced ﬂux form. Next, loosely following [65], we reformulate the system of eigen-
value ODEs in “balanced ﬂux” form. To do so, we rescale the ﬂux variables via

(5.3)

where ˇr is given by

(5.4)

ˇr ˇw = w, ˇrˇx = ˜x, ˇrˇy = y, and ˇrˇz = ˜z ,

ˇr(λ, ξ) :=(cid:112)|ξ|2 + |λ|2.

13

Then, writing ˇW := ( ˇw, ˇx, ˇy, ˇz, u, v, e)T and ˇrˇλ = λ, r ˇξ = ξ, we may re-express (5.1) in the
form

ˇW(cid:48) = ˇA(x1; ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) ˇW,

In the one-dimensional case ξ = 0, this reduces to the integrated equations of [38]. Thus,
the balanced ﬂux form may be viewed as a generalization to the multidimensional case of
the integrated equations commonly used in one dimension. Like the integrated equations,
equations (5.6) have the advantage of removing the zero eigenvalue at the origin of the
original system (5.2), hence are preferable for numerical stability computations [12].

5.2. Consistent splitting. Denote by

ˇA±(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) := lim

ˇA(x1; ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr)

x1→±∞

the limiting coeﬃcient matrices at x1 = ±∞. (These limits exist by exponential convergence
of proﬁles, Lemma 3.1.) Denote by S± = S±(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) and U± = U±(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) the stable and
unstable subspaces of ˇA±.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Following [1], we say that (5.1) exhibits consistent splitting on a given
(ˇλ, ˇξ, r)-domain if ˇA± are hyperbolic, with dim S+ and dim U− constant and summing to the
dimension of the full space (in this case 7).

By continuous dependence of ˇA on ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr and standard matrix perturbation theory, S+

and U− are continuous on any domain for which consistent splitting holds.
Lemma 5.2. For all Γ > 0, µ, ν > 0, η ≥ 0, 1 ≥ u+ > u∗, (5.1)–(5.2) exhibit consistent
splitting on {Re ˇλ ≥ 0, ˇξ ∈ R, r > 0}, with dim S+ = 4 and dim U− = 3. Moreover, for
1 > u+ ≥ u∗, subspaces S+ and U−, along with their associated spectral projections, extend
continuously to

{Re ˇλ ≥ 0, ˇξ ∈ R, ˇr ≥ 0} ,

with respect to all arguments ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr and parameters Γ, µ, η, ν, u+.
Proof. For ﬁnite-amplitude shocks, u+ > u∗, this follows by the general results of [30], which
apply in particular to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with either standard or van
der Waals equation of state. Though carried out for form (5.2), the analysis of [30] applies
equally to the form (5.5).
(Away from ˇr = 0, this follows immediately by invariance of
eigenvalues under a nonsingular change of coordinates; near ˇr = 0, it follows by repeating
the analysis of [30] in the new coordinates.)

14

As observed in [38], the same argument applies to ˇA+ also in the limiting case u+ = u∗,
since the hypotheses of [30] remain satisﬁed. Thus, as in the one-dimensional analysis of [38],
it remains only to verify the claim for ˇA− in the limiting case u+ → u∗, for which e−, u−, ρ−
converge to 0, 1, 1. For ˇr > 0, this is most conveniently veriﬁed by working in the original
coordinates of (5.2) and recalling the correspondence between triples (λ, α, iξ) with α an
eigenvalue of A−(λ, ξ) and solutions (λ, iζ1, iζ2) of the dispersion relation

of the symbol of the limiting eigenvalue equation written as a second-order system [79, 80].
In coordinates U := (ρ, u, v, e)T , we ﬁnd, consulting equations (1.45)–(1.47) of [80], that, for
ρ = u = 1, v = e = 0,

and

from which, by upper block-triangular form, we may read oﬀ the solutions

j iζaj −(cid:80)

uncoupled hyperbolic mode represented by the ﬁrst row of symbol −(cid:80)

Evidently, the only pure imaginary α = iζ1 corresponding to Re λ ≥ 0 is the single root
α ≡ −λ for λ pure imaginary, associated with the special solution (5.8), arising through the
jk ζjζkbjk,
with all other roots α strictly stable (negative real part) or unstable (positive real part)
on ξ ∈ R, Re λ ≥ 0. The root −λ is strictly stable for Re λ > 0, from which we see that
consistent splitting holds for ξ ∈ R and Re λ > 0.
Moreover, observe that the total eigenspace associated with −λ along with the remaining,
strictly stable eigenvalues of A−, corresponding for Re λ to the stable subspace S−, converges
at the boundary Re λ → 0 to the center-stable subspace CS− of A−, which remains strictly
spectrally separated from the unstable subspace U−. Redeﬁning S− as CS− on the whole of
Re λ ≥ 0, we thus obtain the claimed continuity by standard matrix perturbation theory, for
all ˇr > 0.
Finally, we consider the case ˇr → 0. From (5.7), we see that the shock remains non-
characteristic at x = −∞ as u+ → u∗; moreover, all modes are incoming to the shock
(positive hyperbolic characteristics cj ≡ ζ1), corresponding to its nature as a “one-shock”,
or left-moving wave relative to the ambient ﬂuid ﬂow ˆu > 0. Recalling the low-frequency
analysis of [79, 30], we may thus conclude that the 4 center-stable modes at x = −∞ exactly
correspond to the 4 “slow”, or “hyperbolic” modes whose eigenvalues converge to zero as
r → 0, with the other 3 unstable modes corresponding to “fast”, or “parabolic” modes whose

15

eigenvalues are bounded away from zero as ˇr → 0. From this spectral separation, we obtain
(cid:3)
the claimed continuity by standard matrix perturbation theory.

Remark 5.3. From (5.7), we see that system (2.1a)–(2.1d) leaves the class of Kawashima-
type symmetric hyperbolic–parabolic systems [44] in the nonphysical limit e → 0, losing the
properties of symmetrizability and genuine coupling (see [80, 79, 45] for deﬁnitions of these
terms); indeed, the ﬁrst-order part of the symbol is no longer hyperbolic, featuring a Jordan
block. Thus, the symbolic analyses of [30, 80, 79] do not apply in this case.

5.3. Construction of the Evans function. We now construct the Evans function associ-
ated with (5.5), following the approach of [61, 65].

Lemma 5.4. There exist bases

of U−(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) and S+(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr), extending continuously in ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr and Γ, ν, µ, η, u+ to {Re λ ≥
0, ξ ∈ R} for Γ > 0, ν, µ > 0, η ≥ 0, and 1 > u+ ≥ u∗.
Proof. Standard matrix perturbation theory; see, e.g., [43].

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.5. There exist bases

ˇW − = ( ˇW −

1 , ˇW −

2 , ˇW −

3 )(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr),

ˇW + = ( ˇW +

4 , ˇW +

5 , ˇW +

6 , ˇW +

7 )(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr)

of the unstable manifold at x1 = −∞ and the stable manifold at x1 = +∞ of (5.5) asymptotic
to eˇA−x1V − and eˇA+x1V +, respectively, as x → ∓∞, extending continuously in ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr and
Γ, ν, µ, η, u+ to {Re ˇλ ≥ 0, ˇξ ∈ R, ˇr ≥ 0} for Γ > 0, µ > |η| ≥ 0, ν > 0, and 1 > u+ ≥ u∗.
Proof. This follows by uniform exponential convergence of ˇA to ˇB± as x1 → ±∞, Lemma 3.1,
using the conjugation lemma of [58] to construct solutions of the variable-coeﬃcient system
(5.5) in terms of solutions of its constant-coeﬃcient limits at x = ±∞.
(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 5.6. The Evans function associated with (5.5) is deﬁned as

D(λ, ξ) = ˇD(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) := det( ˇW +, ˇW −)|x1=0.

(5.9)
Proposition 5.7. The Evans function ˇD is continuous in ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr and Γ, ν, µ, η, u+ on {Re ˇλ ≥
0, ˇξ ∈ R, ˇr ≥ 0} for Γ > 0, µ > |η| ≥ 0, ν > 0, and 1 > u+ ≥ u∗. Moreover, on
{Re ˇλ ≥ 0, ˇξ ∈ R, ˇr ≥ 0}\{ˇr = 0}, for u+ > u∗, its zeros correspond with eigenvalues of the
integrated linearized operator about the shock layer, i.e., with solutions of (4.2) decaying at
x1 = ±∞.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows by Lemma 5.5. The second follows by the asymptotic
description W ±
together with the consistent splitting property, which implies
decay at x1 = ±∞ of the constant-coeﬃcient solutions eˇA±x1V ±
(cid:3)
j .
Remark 5.8. Proposition 5.7 includes in particular the key information that the Evans func-
tion converges in the strong shock limit u+ → u∗ to the Evans function for the limiting
system at u+ = u∗, uniformly on compact subsets of {Re λ ≥ 0}.
Remark 5.9. The Evans function as so far described is highly non-unique, due to the many
choices for continuous prolongation of subspaces U−(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr) and S+(ˇλ, ˇξ, ˇr). This non-
uniqueness will be removed in Sections 7–8 by speciﬁcation of a numerical continuation
algorithm.

Remark 5.10. It is readily shown by a low-frequency calculation similar to those of [83, 79,
80, 30] that D(·,·, 0) does not vanish at ˇr = 0 for Re ˇλ ≥ 0, ˇξ ∈ R, so long as the associated
discontinuous shock satisﬁes the hyperbolic stability condition, as has been veriﬁed for ideal
gas equation of state by Erpenbeck, Majda, and others [21, 52, 53, 54, 80]. Thus, the zero
at the origin is indeed removed by the choice of balanced ﬂux coordinates, as we verify by
direct numerical computation in Section 7. For further details, see [12].

6. High-frequency bounds

Adapting to the multidimensional case the approach of Humpherys et al. [38], we start by
identifying a bounded set in (λ, ξ)-space outside of which there are no unstable eigenvalues.
This will reduce our computational domain to a compact set in frequency space, making the
problem feasible for numerical Evans function computation. Following [30], we introduce the
parabolic coordinates

(6.1)

(6.2)

λ = ˘r˘λ,
˘r := |ξ|2 + |λ|,

ξ = ˘r1/2 ˘ξ,
| ˘ξ|2 + |˘λ| = 1.

(Not to be confused with the standard polar coordinates of Section 5.1.) To simplify calcula-
tions, we restrict to the case ˘λ pure imaginary that we shall ultimately need.6 By symmetry
of the eigenvalue equations under complex conjugation, it is suﬃcient to take ˘λ = i˘τ , ˘τ ≥ 0,

As established in Lemma B.1 below, the eigenvalues of β have real parts uniformly bounded
from zero, hence, recalling that ˘λ = i˘τ is pure imaginary, we also ﬁnd that the matrix
(ˆρ˘λ˘r1/2I6 + β)−1 is uniformly bounded, hence ψ and ψ(cid:48) are uniformly bounded. In practice
we will estimate these numerically. Likewise, we see that the center-stable subspace Σ− and
the unstable subspace Σ+ of D1/2 must have a uniform spectral gap bounded from zero, given
by the minimum real part of the eigenvalues associated with the unstable subspace of β.

6.2. Numerical implementation. With these preparations, we are now ready to obtain
bounds using the “tracking” procedure of Appendix A. We describe the plan of attack: By
block diagonalizing D1/2 and noting an ˘r1/2-dependent separation between the numerical
ranges of the stable and unstable blocks, we can use Lemma A.1 to obtain high-frequency
bounds in ˘r for each ﬁxed ˘ξ.

20

6.2.1. Tracking Setup. Since the vector space C6 an be split into complementary β-invariant
subspaces corresponding to its stable and unstable subspaces, we can form a smooth block
matrix R of column vectors (see Appendix A.2) corresponding to bases of those complemen-
tary subspaces together with the (1, 1) block of D1/2, which contributes a purely imaginary
eigenvalue to the spectrum of D1/2 (since we are restricting to the case that ˘λ = i˘τ ). By
associating this center space with N− and setting L := R−1, we have the block form

(cid:123)(cid:122)

Θ(˘r, ˘ξ)

(6.18)

L D1/2 R = N :=

where dim N− = 4 and dim N+ = 3.

Furthermore, by setting Z = RV, we have that V(cid:48) = (LDR − LR(cid:48))V, where
LDR − LR(cid:48) = ˘r1/2N + L U−1(C0 + ˘r−1/2C−1/2)U R − L U−1U(cid:48) R − LR(cid:48).

(cid:124)

(cid:125)

By separating out the asymptotic rates, we can write

Θ(˘r, ˘ξ) = Θ(0)(˘r, ˘ξ) + ˘r−1/2Θ(−1/2)(˘r, ˘ξ),

where

Θ(0)(˘r, ˘ξ) = L U−1C0U R − L U−1U(cid:48) R − LR(cid:48)

Θ(−1/2)(˘r, ˘ξ) = L U−1C−1/2U R.

Following the block structure of N, each Θ(j)(˘r, ˘ξ) can be further written as

(6.19)

Θ(j)(˘r, ˘ξ) =

Θ(j)−−(˘r, ˘ξ) Θ(j)−+(˘r, ˘ξ)
++(˘r, ˘ξ)
Θ(j)

+−(˘r, ˘ξ) Θ(j)

.

The presence of the ˘r1/2 coeﬃcient in front of N results in a growing numerical gap δ = ˘δ˘r1/2
as ˘r gets larger. As we show below, each of the blocks (6.19) are uniformly bounded in ˘r
for each ﬁxed ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1], and thus we are able to take ˘r large enough that tracking condition
(A.6) given in Lemma A.1 is satisﬁed and high-frequency bounds are established.
6.2.2. Uniform Tracking Bounds. Assume that ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1] is ﬁxed. The tracking condition
(A.6) given in Lemma A.1 takes the form

(cid:113)

(6.20)

and separation between the numerical ranges of the blocks as described in (A.3) reduces to

˘δ = min σ(Re N+) − max σ(Re N−).

We can show that the right-hand size of (6.20) is uniformly bounded in ˘r while the left-hand
size grows without bound. Thus, for suﬃciently large ˘r, the inequality will be satisﬁed.

21

By replacing the right-hand side of (6.20) with uniform bounds, we can compute a value
˘r∗ which guarantees that the tracking condition (6.20) is satisﬁed whenever ˘r ≥ ˘r∗. We ﬁnd
˘r∗ by setting y =

˘r∗ and solving

a + b/y + 2(cid:112)(c + d/y)(e + f /y)

˘δ2y4 − 2a˘δy3 + (a2 − b˘δ − ce)y2 + (2ab − de − cf )y + (b2 − df ) = 0.

(6.23)
Thus, to obtain our uniform tracking bound ˘r∗ := ˘r∗( ˘ξ), we simply ﬁnd the largest real root
of (6.23) and square it. Therefore we have established the following theorem:
Theorem 6.1 (Uniform Tracking Bounds). Let ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1] be ﬁxed. The tracking bound,
namely the largest value ˘r∗ of ˘r above which there exist no imaginary eigenvalues, is bounded
above by the square of the largest real root of (6.23).

By inverting the transformation (6.1)–(6.2), we have that λ = i˘r(1 − ˘ξ2) and ξ = ˘r1/2 ˘ξ.
From Theorem 6.1 we ﬁnd that there are no purely imaginary eigenvalues λ of (4.2) satisfying

(6.24)
where ξ = ˘r∗(u+, ˘ξ)1/2 ˘ξ. Thus, once the high-frequency bounds ˘r∗ := ˘r∗( ˘ξ) are established,
we have reduced our investigations to a compact parameter domain in ξ, λ.

|λ| ≥ r∗(u+, ˘ξ) := ˘r∗( ˘ξ)(1 − ˘ξ2),

Remark 6.2. The caveat to Theorem 6.1, computationally speaking, is that one would need
to prove that the coeﬃcients in (6.22) are bounded and numerically tractable in order to
securely claim high-frequency bounds. When we plot the values for varying ˘r (across a
range of ﬁxed ˘ξ), they seem like well-behaved functions that decay for large ˘r. However,
without further analysis, we cannot be certain that the functions do not blow up outside of
our computational domain. Therefore, below, we compactify the computational region by
a more crude tracking bound ˘r∗
crude.
In other words, we ﬁrst show that admissible values of ˘r are bounded above by ˘r∗
crude, then
compute the coeﬃcients in (6.22) by taking the suprema on the domain 0 ≤ ˘r ≤ ˘r∗
crude and
use (6.23) to establish the vastly sharper uniform tracking bound ˘r∗ deﬁned above.

crude that eliminates the need to investigate for ˘r ≥ ˘r∗

22

6.2.3. Crude Bounds. Using a combination of numerical evaluation and careful analysis, we
are able to determine crude high-frequency bounds. We begin with the realization that the
norms on the Θ-blocks in (A.2) can be bounded by the norm on Θ. Speciﬁcally, we have
that (cid:107)Θ(0)
(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)Θ(cid:107) for each k, l ∈ {−, +}. Thus, the right-hand side of the
tracking condition in (A.6) satisﬁes

kl + ˘r−1/2Θ(−1/2)

kl

This results in the following corollary to Lemma A.1:
Corollary 6.3 (Crude Bounds). Let ˘r0 > 1 and ˘δ ∈ [0, 1] be given. Then, the crude estimate

(cid:107)Θ−−(cid:107) + (cid:107)Θ++(cid:107) + 2(cid:112)(cid:107)Θ−+(cid:107)(cid:107)Θ+−(cid:107) ≤ 4(cid:107)Θ(cid:107).

observe that

Thus, our crude bounds are determined by ﬁnding uniform bounds on (cid:107)Θ(cid:107). To begin, we

(cid:107)Θ(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107)(cid:107)U(cid:107)(cid:107)U−1(cid:107)(cid:0)(cid:107)C0(cid:107) + ˘r−1/2(cid:107)C−1/2(cid:107)(cid:1) + (cid:107)LR(cid:48)(cid:107) + (cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107)(cid:107)U−1U(cid:48)(cid:107).
(cid:107)Θ(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107)(cid:107)U(cid:107)2(cid:0)(cid:107)C0(cid:107) + ˘r−1/2(cid:107)C−1/2(cid:107)(cid:1) + (cid:107)LR(cid:48)(cid:107) + (cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107)(cid:107)ψx(cid:107).

Since (cid:107)U−1(cid:107) = (cid:107)U(cid:107) and (cid:107)U−1U(cid:48)(cid:107) = (cid:107)U(cid:48)(cid:107) = (cid:107)ψx1(cid:107), we have

Note that (cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107), (cid:107)LR(cid:48)(cid:107), (cid:107)C0(cid:107), (cid:107)C−1/2(cid:107), and ˘δ−1( ˘ξ) have no ˘r dependence and are readily
computable. Thus, to compute uniform bounds for (cid:107)Θ(cid:107), we need the uniform bounds on
(cid:107)U(cid:107) and (cid:107)ψx1(cid:107). A tricky point in our analysis is that both (cid:107)U(cid:107) and (cid:107)ψx1(cid:107) depend on the
matrix (ˆρ˘λ˘r1/2I6 + β)−1, which has ˘r1/2 dependence. Using Lemmas A.4, A.5, and A.6, we
bound (cid:107)U(cid:107) and (cid:107)ψx1(cid:107) numerically by stepping through values of s ∈ [0, (1 + b)(cid:107)β(cid:107)] and
s ∈ [0, 2(cid:107)β(cid:107)] in the computation of M0 and M1, respectively. We note that the bound on
(cid:107)Θ(cid:107) decays to a constant as ˘r−1/2 and is thus uniform. It remains to assign numerical values
to the diﬀerent terms above.
The following bounds are computed numerically for a monatomic gas (Γ = 2/3) and taken
to be uniform over ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1] and over all shock strengths u+ ∈ [u∗, 1], where u+ → 1 is the
transonic limit and u+ → u∗ is the inﬁnite Mach number limit (recall u∗ = 1/4 is deﬁned in
(3.14)). The following ˘r-independent quantities are
(cid:107)C0(cid:107) ≤ 4.868,

(cid:107)C−1/2(cid:107) ≤ 8.5440,

(cid:107)L(cid:107)(cid:107)R(cid:107) ≤ 2.425,

˘δ−1 ≤ 1.72.

(cid:107)LR(cid:48)(cid:107) ≡ 1,

From Lemma A.6(i)-(ii), we have M0 = 0.8130 and M1 = 2.0057. From Lemma A.5, this
gives

Furthermore, from Lemma A.6(iii), we ﬁnd the bounds

∀ ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1].

Thus, when ˘r > ˘r∗
crude we have that no purely imaginary eigenvalues of (4.2) can exist. Having
crude bounds allows us to compactify the suprema computed in (6.22), thus establishing the
vastly smaller tracking bound in Theorem 6.1.

6.2.4. Numerical results. In Figure 1, we display the high-frequency bounds for monatomic
shocks computed as a function of ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1] and u+ ∈ [u∗, 1] as given by Theorem 6.1 and
(6.24). These vary from approximately 32 for weak (small-amplitude) shocks to approxi-
mately 280 in the strong-shock (maximal amplitude) limit, with the largest values occurring
for ˘ξ = 0, corresponding to the one-dimensional case. The diatomic case looks essentially the
same, but with bounds ranging from roughly 32 to 500. These values give an upper bound
on our computational region.

Remark 6.4. Here, we are blocking the imaginary axis for high frequencies, which will suﬃce
(by a homotopy argument) to capture any unstable zeros as they cross the imaginary axis. As
described below, for bounded frequencies we not only check for zeros on the imaginary axis,
but perform winding number computations about semicircular contours in the unstable half
plane with bounding diameter along the imaginary axis, counting roots in the interior. Thus,
we detect any such crossing roots not only at the moment that they cross the imaginary axis,
but afterward as well, making this approach particularly robust and convenient; in particular,
we can be sure that crossings are not missed between mesh points in the computation.

Remark 6.5. There are many ways to carry out the block-diagonalization described above.
Here, we followed a naive approach and it turned out to be suﬃcient.
If necessary, one
may use Lyapunov’s Lemma (Lemma A.3 below) to eﬀect a further change of coordinates
guaranteeing the hypotheses of the quantitative tracking lemma (Lemma A.1) in terms of
M± = Re(P1/2
). We don’t ﬁnd this to be needed in the present case since Re N±
already have a gap; thus we simply set M± = N±.

7. Low-frequency study

7.1. Theoretical background and implementation. As noted in the introduction, the
low-frequency limit of the (viscous) Evans function captures inviscid behavior described in
terms of a Lopatinski determinant [83]. Indeed, this is one of the regimes in which substantial
analytic information can be extracted from the Evans function. In particular, combining the
inviscid stability results of Majda [52] and Erpenbeck [21] for ideal, polytropic gases with the
low-frequency analysis of Zumbrun & Serre [83] and Zumbrun [79, 80], we may immediately
conclude that there are no low-frequency zeros except at the origin. In this section, we show

24

Figure 1. Monotone high-frequency bounds |λ| as a function of ˘ξ and u+.
Notice that the bounds are large for strong shocks when ˘ξ is near zero and
relatively small elsewhere, that is when shocks are weak or when ˘ξ is near 1.

that our numerical implementation of the Evans function captures the expected behavior near
the origin. This both provides a strong validation for our computations and, when combined
with our high-frequency (Section 6) and intermediate-frequency (Section 8) studies, allows
us to give a complete description of the behavior of the Evans function on its entire domain.
To capture the Lopatinski determinant, itself a function of frequencies which is homoge-
nous degree one, the low-frequency analysis of the Evans function is based on radial limits.
Here, we numerically investigate such limits using the balanced ﬂux formulation of the Evans
function (see Section 5.1 and [12]); this alternative Evans function does not vanish at the
origin but still detects unstable eigenvalues. Moreover, it has (nonvanishing) radial limits
equal to the value of the Lopatinski determinant at the same frequency angle on the ball
of radius one. In principle, we could estimate the region of non-vanishing analytically, but
instead we estimate the size of this region by performing a numerical convergence study
along rays through the origin: at the point at which we estimate the relative error to be
0.05, we assume that there are no zeros along this ray.

by θ310 = 310
given in (7.2). Note that all values are well bounded away from zero, indicating
stability for |ξ, λ| ≤ 0.1.

1000 · π

Finally, to implement this calculation, we initialize the Evans function with bases at ∞
by ﬁrst evolving using Kato’s ODE in the angle along a semicircle of radius 0.1 for the
monatomic case and 0.12 for the diatomic case. Then we evolve radially toward the origin to
0.001 using Kato’s ODE again (this time in the radial variable), verifying the relative error
at the end to be below 0.05.

7.2. Estimation of relative error. A detail of the algorithm is the means of estimating
the relative error

| ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇr) − ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, 0)|

| ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇr)|

.

By the analysis of [83, 79], we know that ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇr) − ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, 0) ∼ ˇrs, where s = 1 at
points of analyticity and s = 1/2 at “glancing points” where ˇD(·,·, 0) exhibits a square-root
singularity. Hence, for successive mesh points ˇrj+1 < ˇrj,

|∆ ˇDj| := | ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇrj+1) − ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, rj)

|∆ˇrj|

∼ s| ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇrj) − ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, 0)|ˇr−1
where ∆ˇrj := ˇrj+1 − ˇrj. Thus, rearranging, we may estimate
≈ s−1|∆ ˇDj|/|Dj|
|∆ˇrj|/|rj| ≤ 2

| ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, ˇr) − ˇD( ˇξ, ˇλ, 0)|

Thus, we can use as a stopping or suﬃciency criterion in our numerical convergence study
the requirement that the righthand side be suﬃciently small, say ≤ 0.05.

r) of the Evans function is a function of angle corresponding to the Lopatinski condition
of the inviscid theory [83, 12]. This function is known to have a square-root singularity
in the angle at certain “glancing” points (see, e.g., the appendix by Jenssen & Lyng that
appears in [79]). As discussed in §5.5.1 of [12], this singularity is preserved by our method
of initialization/coordinatization.
More precisely, consultation of Jenssen & Lyng’s appendix shows that the precise location
is given by | Im λ|2 = (c2 − |u|2)|ξ|2. (Note that, by the Lax shock inequalities, this can only
occur on the righthand side x = +∞.) Thus, in polar coordinates, we obtain

Then, using the following physical parameters,

e+ =

u+(Γ + 2 − Γu+)

= 0.333 ,

we computed the Evans function by ﬁrst taking a contour of the form (r, cos θ, i sin θ), where
θ varied 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Then, we computed a series of radial spokes by following along the
ﬁxed-angle contours (r, cos θk, i sin θk), where r1 ≤ r ≤ r2. We use r1 = 0.001 and r2 = 0.1.
For our computation, we took n + 1 radial spokes θk = kπ
2 , where k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n; in our
case n = 1000. For the given parameters,
θ∗ = tan−1

√
0.28 = 0.4867 ,

so we examine the behavior near the spoke whose θk value is closest to θ∗. Evidently, for
2 ≈ 0.4869. Figure 2 shows the output
this experiment, the relevant value is θ310 = 310
of this experiment; the spoke corresponding to k = 310 is highlighted in the ﬁgure, and
the singularity is clearly visible, and its presence at the correct location gives a strong
conﬁrmation of the validity of our computations. Note that all values of ˇD are clearly
nonzero, indicating stability.

1000 · π

We carried out similar experiments for both the monatomic gas case Γ = 2/3 and the
diatomic gas case, letting u+ vary across the strong and weak shock regimes. Speciﬁcally,
we computed (7.1) for (8.7) and (8.8). An a posteriori check reveals that the ratio in (7.1)
does not exceed 0.0383, verifying our convergence criterion.

7.4. Expanded study for a single shock. Recall that we are eliminating possible unstable
imaginary roots, for purpose of a later homotopy argument. For this later argument, we
require a single, initial, shock wave for which there exist no low-frequency roots with Re λ ≥
0. For both the monatomic and diatomic gas cases, we investigate the case u+ = 0.6,
performing the same type of low-frequency analysis as previously, but now taking λ =
sin θeiφ, adding an additional angular loop 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2. Speciﬁcally we chose ∆φ = π/50
and tested 21 values ranging from φ = 0 to π/2. As before, we ﬁnd that all values are
nonzero, with ratio (7.1) not exceeding 0.0038, thus verifying nonexistence of any (not only
pure imaginary) unstable low-frequency eigenvalues. We note that the bound is an order of
magnitude smaller than the φ = 0 bound performed for all values of u+ because the upper
bound was very small for u+ = 0.6 relative to the other values tested.

27

7.5. Conclusion. There are no unstable imaginary eigenvalues for |ξ, λ| ≤ 0.1, for any shock
strength, for either the monatomic or diatomic case. For the special value u+ = 0.6, there
are no unstable eigenvalues with nonnegative real part, for monatomic or diatomic case.

8. Intermediate-frequency study

Having treated the high- and low-frequency regimes, ˘r ≥ r∗( ˘ξ) and |ξ, λ| ≤ 1.0 in the
coordinates of their respective sections, it remains to study the main, intermediate-frequency,
regime consisting of their complement. The ﬁrst step is to identify a region containing this set
in the natural coordinates ξ, λ appropriate for this regime, and in a form suitable for winding
number computations holding ξ ﬁxed and varying λ, that is, to bound the set ˘r ≤ r∗( ˘ξ) by
one composed of slices ξ = ξ0, |λ| ≤ r.
Lemma 8.1. The set Σ1 := {(ξ,|λ|) = (˘r1/2 ˘ξ, ˘r(1− ˘ξ2)) : 0 ≤ ˘r ≤ r∗( ˘ξ), 0 ≤ ˘ξ ≤ 1} deﬁned
in (6.24)7 is contained in Σ2 := ∪0≤ ˘ξ≤1{(ξ,|λ|) : ξ = r∗( ˘ξ)1/2 ˘ξ, 0 ≤ |λ| ≤ r∗( ˘ξ)(1 − ˘ξ2}.
Proof. Deﬁne S := { ˘ξ, ˘r : 0 ≤ ˘r ≤ r∗( ˘ξ)} and Ψ : ( ˘ξ, ˘r) → (ξ,|λ|) = (˘r1/2 ˘ξ, ˘r(1 − ˘ξ2)), so
that Σ1 = Ψ(S). It is readily veriﬁed that Ψ is one-to-one on S, except along the boundary
˘r = 0, which maps to the point (ξ,|λ|) = (0, 0). For, equating
˘ξ2, ˘r2(1 − ˘ξ2

˘ξ1, ˘r1(1 − ˘ξ2

(˘r1/2

1

1)) = (˘r1/2

2

2)),

we ﬁnd, squaring the ﬁrst coordinates and adding to the second, that ˘r1 = ˘r2, whence,
comparing ﬁrst coordinates, ˘ξ1 = ˘ξ2 unless ˘rj = 0. Thus, Ψ(∂S) deﬁnes a simple closed
curve in the ξ-λ plane, and (by continuity of Ψ together with the Jordan Curve Theorem)
therefore Ψ(S)int = Ψ(∂Sint) and ∂Σ1 = ∂Ψ(S) = Ψ(∂S). Rewriting

Σ2 = ∪(ξ0,|λ0|)∈Ψ(∂S){ξ0} × [0,|λ0|] = ∪(ξ0,|λ0|)∈∂Σ1{ξ0} × [0,|λ0|],

we thus have evidently Σ1 ⊂ Σ2.

(cid:3)
Our protocol, based on Lemma 8.1, is to step through ˘ξ ∈ [0, 1], testing for roots of the
Evans function on the ﬁxed-ξ slices ξ = r∗( ˘ξ)1/2 ˘ξ, 0 ≤ |λ| ≤ r∗( ˘ξ)} using a winding number
computation in λ around the semicircle Γ := ∂{λ : Re λ ≥ 0, |λ| ≤ r∗( ˘ξ)}. For this analysis,
it is necessary to use a version of the Evans function (i) is analytic in λ, and (ii) has no roots
on, or overly near, the curve Γ, in particular at λ = 0. The standard Evans function D(ξ, λ)
deﬁned in (5.9) has these properties for ξ bounded away from 0, but for ξ = 0 has a root
at λ = 0, hence gives numerical diﬃculty for ξ too near 0. We ﬁnd it useful, therefore, to
supplement this standard Evans function in our investigations with a modiﬁcation removing
the zero at (ξ, λ) = (0, 0), particularly near small values of ξ, λ.

8.1. Modiﬁed balanced ﬂux coordinates. Speciﬁcally, we construct For intermediate
frequencies a modiﬁed version of the balanced ﬂux Evans function of Section 5.1 possessing
the property of analyticity in λ. The key idea is to note that the Evans system (5.6) is
independent of the deﬁnition of r(ξ, λ). Meanwhile, consistent splitting is inherited in r, ξ(cid:93), λ(cid:93)
coordinates wherever it holds in the original ξ, λ coordinates, where ξ(cid:93) := ξ/r, λ(cid:93) := λ/r.
Thus, deﬁning

(8.1)

D(cid:93)(r, ξ(cid:93), λ(cid:93))

7 Here and below we suppress the u+ argument for ease in writing.

28

to be the Evans function associated with (5.6), we obtain an arbitrary number of diﬀerent
versions of the Evans function, with diﬀerent properties, through the prescription

(8.2)
generalizing (5.9), one for each choice of r(·).

Dr(·)(ξ, λ) := D(cid:93)(r(ξ, λ), ξ/r(ξ, λ), λ/r(ξ, λ))

The choice r(ξ, λ) = |ξ, λ| recovers the balanced ﬂux version described in Section 5.1. As
described further in [12], this has the advantage of removing roots at the origin, similarly as
for integrated coordinates in 1D. However, it has the disadvantage that the resulting Evans
function Dr(·) is not analytic in either of the variables ξ or λ, hence we are not able to carry
out winding number computations, thus losing a key dimensional advantage in carrying out
large-scale Evans computations in the intermediate frequency regime.

For intermediate frequencies, we therefore introduce the modiﬁed radial function

r = r2(ξ, λ) := |ξ| + λ

with the twin properties that (i) r2 ∼ r for low frequencies, so that this deﬁnition likewise
removes vanishing at the origin, and (ii) r2 unlike r is analytic in λ for each ﬁxed ξ. The
associated Evans function Dr2 inherits analyticity in λ away from (ξ, λ) = (0, 0), and is
continuous (indeed, analytic) along rays through the origin.

This allows us, using the Evans function Dr2, to step through various values of ξ and check
for each value by a winding number computation, whether there are any zeros of the Evans
function within the bounded computational domain given by the complement of (6.24). See
[12] for further discussion.

8.2. Advantages and disadvantages. In some sense the modiﬁed balanced ﬂux version of
the Evans function is the multidimensional generalization of the integrated Evans function of
one-dimensional theory, removing undesirable roots at the origin while preserving analyticity
in λ if not ξ. However, whereas the integrated Evans function has similar qualitative behavior
to the standard (unintegrated) one, the modiﬁed balanced ﬂux version is not quite so well-
behaved. A delicate point for this version is behavior for |ξ| (cid:28) 1 but not zero, since there is a
rapid transition at |λ| = |ξ| from angle ( ˇξ, ˇλ) = (0, 1) to ( ˇξ, ˇλ) = (i, 0), with associated rapid
variation in Dr2 corresponding to the limiting values along radii of diﬀerent angles through
the origin. This leads to substantial winding of the image contour for values of |λ| on the order
of |ξ|, requiring additional reﬁnement in case of small ξ in order to obtain a smooth-looking
output. Even for intermediate values of ξ, the image contours for the modiﬁed balanced
ﬂux Evans function Dr2 exhibit substantial additional winding near λ = 0 as compared to
image contours of the standard Evans function D and degrading the attractiveness (and
readability) of ﬁgures. See Figures 4–7.

However, the property that Dr2 does not vanish at the origin ensures that winding number
computations remain well-conditioned even for small ξ. Indeed, it should be noted that, for
both standard and modiﬁed balanced ﬂux Evans functions, it is not necessary to compute
winding numbers for contours passing arbitrarily close to (ξ, λ) = (0, 0), since we have
already treated this region by a separate low-frequency analysis.
In the end, the results
from both (standard, and modiﬁed balanced ﬂux) types of winding number computation are
satisfactory, giving a useful double check on stability conclusions.

Figure 3. Evans function output along the semi-circular contour in Eulerian
In (a) we see the output of the weak-shock high- ˘ξ case with

u+ = 0.27 and ˘ξ = 0.95. This corresponds to r∗ = 16.3 (for the high frequency
bounds in |λ|) and ξ = 12.2778. In (b), we compute the angle of the winding.
Notice that the outer circles wrap 24 times around the origin. By zooming
into the origin one sees an unwinding of the contour the other way, so that
the net winding is zero. In other words, this contour has winding number zero
and therefore demonstrates that shocks in this parameter regime are spectrally
stable, yet it is not obvious via inspection that this is the case. We remark
that over 2492 contour points were needed to produce this graph.

dy1/dx1 = ˆρ(x1).

8.3. Pseudo-Lagrangian coordinates. Besides the change in dependent variables in the
Evans system just discussed, we ﬁnd it necessary also to make a “pseudo-Lagrangian” change
of coordinates x1 → y1 in the independent variable x1, determined by
(8.3)
This has the eﬀect of converting the upper lefthand diagonal element −rˇλˆρ in the coeﬃcient
matrix given in (5.6) to a constant: (dx1/dy1)(−rˇλˆρ) = −rˇλ. As this entry, similarly as
in the high-frequency analysis of Section 6, dominates order r high-frequency behavior, and
as the Evans function by its construction factors out exponential growth predicted by the
endstates of the coeﬃcient matrices at x1 = ±∞, the result is to eliminate factors ∼ eCλ that
would otherwise occur, leaving more manageable eD
λ asymptotics for large λ. This has the
eﬀect of greatly reducing winding about the origin in our winding number computations,
thus reducing the number of mesh points needed and thereby computation time; indeed, in
the original coordinates, we were not able to compute past |λ| values of order more than
one, whereas in pseudo-Lagrangian coordinates we are able to compute out the two orders
of magnitude farther that we need to complete the analysis. See [11] for further discussion
of this important point.
To illustrate the amount of winding in basic coordinates, we consider the shock u+ = 0.75
with ˘ξ = 0.95. This corresponds to r∗ = 10.4 (for the high frequency bounds in |λ|) and

unwinding for a net winding number of zero. Note however that a radius of r∗ = 10.4 is
relatively small for the high-frequency bounds as given in Figure 1. Indeed when the shock
is strong (close to u+ = 0.25) and the value of ˘ξ is small (close to ˘ξ = 0), we see that the
radius r∗ is around 280. This results in so much winding that it is prohibitive to resolve the
winding number using the basic form of the Evans function given in (5.1)–(5.2). Thus, the
pseudo-Lagrangian coordinates are essential to this study.

8.4. Numerical implementation. Our approach to Evans function computation is on its
way to becoming a mature technology. All computations in this study were performed using
STABLAB, which is a MATLAB-based toolbox developed by Barker, Humpherys, Lytle,
and Zumbrun [5].

For our intermediate-frequency study, we begin by computing the two-variable traveling
wave proﬁle, which is formulated as a three-point boundary-value problem on the inﬁnite
domain R, that is, in addition to conditions at the end states, a third condition. To simplify
this, we halve the domain and double the size of the system, thus expressing the system as a
two-point boundary-value problem in four variables over a half-line domain [0,∞). We use
a sixth-order solver bvp6c [32], which is a generalization of the built-in lower-order solvers
bvp4c and bvp5c included in MATLAB. We set the absolute and relative tolerances to be
10−8 and 10−6, respectively.
Using two matching conditions, the centering condition, and a projective boundary condi-
tion as x1 → ∞, we are able to solve the proﬁles over the entire parameter regime u+ ∈ [u∗, 1]
with relative ease. We follow the process described in [38] to make sure the computational
domains [−L, L] are suﬃciently large to get good approximations of the Evans function. For
a monatomic gas, the domain varied from L = 40 in the strong shock case to L = 300 in
the weak shock case and for the diatomic case, the domain varied from L = 40 in the strong
shock case to L = 400 for the weak shock case. Note that the weak shock case has slower
exponential decay to the end states and therefore requires a larger domain.

Following the computation of the proﬁle, we are able to set up the batch jobs for Evans
function computation. The STABLAB package uses the continuous orthogonalization ap-
proach to Evans function computation as described in [40]. Speciﬁcally, we compute the
Evans function by solving the system

(8.4a)

(8.4b)

(8.5)

The Evans function then takes the form

Ω(cid:48) = (I − ΩΩ∗)AΩ,
γ(cid:48) = trace(Ω∗AΩ)γ.

D(λ) = γ−(0) γ+(0) det(cid:0)(cid:2)Ω− Ω+

(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x1=0

.

We remark that there are important pre-processing steps built into [5], such as making an
analytic choice of initial conditions via Kato’s method [43]; see [9, 41, 38, 6] for discussions
on these details.

Because of the excessive winding in the case where the shock is strong (u+ near 1/4 for
monatomic and u+ near 1/6 for diatomic) and ˘ξ is small, we also compute the Evans function
using the no-radial option where we throw out the contribution from the scalar ODE (8.4b)

31

that us used to restore analyticity. Thus we simply compute the quantity

(8.6)

Dnr(λ) = det(cid:0)(cid:2)Ω− Ω+

(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x1=0

,

This no-radial formulation leaves us with a topological index that still contains the same
winding number properties (a Poincar´e index) needed to determine the number of eigenvalues
inside the contour; for more details see [2]. All of these are options built into STABLAB.

8.5. Numerical results. We performed three Evans function batch jobs for the monatomic
gas case, and then repeated our eﬀorts for the diatomic case (six batch jobs in total). Each
job was with pseudo-Lagrange coordinates but with diﬀerent Evans function formulations,
namely standard balanced ﬂux formulation, the no-radial balanced ﬂux formulation, and the
modiﬁed balanced ﬂux formulation. Each job was carried out via the continuous orthogo-
nalization method described above for parameter pairs (u+, ˘ξ), where

(8.7)

u+ ∈ {0.25, 0.26, 0.27, 0.28, 0.29, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50,

0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95}

for the monatomic case,

(8.8)

u+ ∈ {0.167, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45,
0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95}

for the diatomic case, and for both cases, we used

˘ξ ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2} ∪ {0.025, 0.05, . . . , 0.95, 0.975, 1.0}.

This corresponds to 40 equally spaced values in ˘ξ on the domain [0.025, 1], together with
an additional 4 equally spaced values for a reﬁned grid on [0.005, 0.025] to better study the
behavior for small values of ˘ξ closer to zero. For each of the 44 values of ˘ξ and 19 − 20
values of v+ (or 45 × 19 = 836 contours for each of the three monatomic batch jobs and
45 × 20 = 900 contours for each of the three diatomic batch jobs), the contour radius was
set taken to be 1.1 times the high-frequency bound r∗ := r∗(u+, ξ) as deﬁned in (6.24). This
extra 10% was taken for good measure. For a physical measure of the associated shock
strengths, we match in Tables 1–2 of Appendix C these values of u+ with the Mach numbers
of the corresponding shocks. Note that u+ = 1/4 corresponds to an inﬁnite Mach number
for the monatomic case and u+ = 1/6 for the diatomic case.

For each of the six batch jobs, the contours consisted of at least 50 radial points in the ﬁrst
quadrant and 50 points along the positive imaginary axis. Exploiting conjugate symmetry,
we reﬂected the output to capture the half of the contour in the fourth quadrant and to
produce the ﬁgures and winding number calculations. We note that for the ﬁrst and third
batch jobs (for both monatomic and diatomic cases), we used a contour-reﬁnement feature
in STABLAB that adds contour points as needed to achieve a pre-determined tolerance of

∆D(λ)
D(λ)

= 0.20.

This guarantees, by Rouch´e’s theorem that our winding number calculations are accurate.
We note that in the monatomic case, that there were contours with as many as 230 points

zero by inspection. The case (a) also has winding number zero, but this is not
obvious given the amount of winding and unwinding around the origin.

many as 474 points.

Figure 5. The no-radial Evans function output for the same four contours
and parameters as Figure 4. We see visually that all of these have winding
number zero.

One of the overarching themes observed in the results of our ﬁrst batch job(s) (for each
of the monatomic and diatomic cases) is that the larger the radius of the semi-circular
contour, the more the Evans function winds and unwinds around the origin. (Note that the
parameter values for which there is a large amount of winding are precisely those for which
mesh reﬁnement was used.) Therefore, in the strong-shock regime(s), when ˘ξ is close to zero,
the high-frequency bounds are also large and thus do a lot of winding; see Figure 1. If the
shock is small or ˘ξ is larger, then the radius is smaller and the winding is minimal. As an
example, we examine the output for four test cases in Figure 4. Speciﬁcally we compute the
Evans function in standard pseudo-Lagrangian balanced ﬂux coordinates toggling between
strong and weak shocks as well as near-zero and near-unity values of ˘ξ. Note that with the
exception of the strong shock case, where ˘ξ is close to zero, that the winding numbers are

zero by inspection. In all cases, but especially when shock is strong and ˘ξ is close to zero,
we computed the winding numbers numerically to conﬁrm that they are zero as expected.

As an additional veriﬁcation, the second Evans function batch job (computed for each of
the monatomic and diatomic cases) was performed using the no-radial formulation8. These
runs produced non-windy albeit non-analytic output for which all runs again have a zero
winding number, by both immediate inspection and direct computation. In particular, in
Figure 5, we compute the same Evans function contours as in Figure 4 except that we use the
no-radial Evans function computation to demonstrate the diﬀerence between the winding of
the standard balanced ﬂux case and the no-radial case.

The third batch job(s) (again for each of the monatomic and diatomic cases) were carried
out using the modiﬁed balanced pseudo-Lagrange formulation. This is the only truly analytic

initializing value at ±∞; see [5] for further details.

formulation that we carried out: the ﬁrst batch job are not analytic on the imaginary axis
because |λ| changes along the contour and thus (5.4) changes as well. In Figure 6, we see
examples of output from this method. Notice the similarity between this output and that of
the standard balanced ﬂux method in Figure 4.

We remark that in the ﬁrst and third batch jobs (for both monotone and diatomic cases) we
also computed contours for ξ = 0 (for all the shock strengths). With the standard balanced
ﬂux formulation, we have a root at λ = 0 and thus winding numbers can’t be computed for
exactly semicircular contours. Thus, we removed a notch on the contour around the origin
so that the output wouldn’t pass through it. Since in the low-frequency limit we already
have demonstrated stability, we are able to do this without aﬀecting the integrity of our
results. With the modiﬁed balanced ﬂux formulation, the notch need not be removed since
λ = 0 is not a root in this case. In Figure 7, we see the ˘ξ = 0 output zoomed near the origin
for a strong shock satisfying u+ = 0.27. Notice that in the standard balanced ﬂux version,
the winding number is zero since the removed notch prevents the contour from touching the
origin. We note that in all cases, for both formulations, the winding number was found to
be zero, signifying spectral stability. We remark that spectral stability is known for ˘ξ = 0,
since this case corresponds to the 1D case studied in [38].

8.6. Conclusions. There are no unstable imaginary eigenvalues for (ξ, λ) in the complement
of region (6.24), except possibly on a ball of radius 0.08 about the origin for monatomic and
0.11 for diatomic, where these values are the minimum value of our ξ-mesh, below which |λ|
of a comparable order require additional reﬁnement for good resolution. Each “unchecked”
region is contained in a ball of suﬃciently small radius (0.1 for monatomic and 0.12 for

frequency analysis.

9. Summary/final conclusions

Combining the numerical results of Sections 6–8, we ﬁnd for both monatomic and diatomic
γ-law equations of state that there are no pure imaginary roots λ of the balanced ﬂux Evans
function for any ξ and any Mach number. Thus, the number of unstable roots for any ﬁxed
ξ is independent of Mach number, so that either all shock proﬁles are stable, or else all are
unstable for a given model. But, on the other hand, we have also shown nonexistence of
unstable eigenvalues of any kind for (ξ, λ) within the computational domain consisting of
the complement of (6.24) minus a small ball. Moreover, for the special value u+ = .6, we
have shown nonexistence of unstable eigenvalues also for this small deleted ball, leaving only
the possibility of high-frequency instability. As the Evans function varies analytically with ξ
outside any ﬁnite ball, it is thus suﬃcient to ﬁnd a single ξ for which there exist no unstable
eigenvalues, nonexistence for all ξ then following by homotopy. Recalling that nonexistence
for ξ = 0 follows from the one-dimensional study of [38], we obtain stability for u+ = .6.
Alternatively, one might appeal to an asymptotic argument like that of [23] in the artiﬁcial
viscosity case to conclude stability in the small-amplitude, or constant-state limit M → 1.
That some shocks are stable implies that all shocks are stable for Mach number M ≥ 1.035,
completing the analysis. As noted in the introduction, the M → 1 limit should be treatable
analytically by methods similar to those of [23, 65].

Appendix A. Numerical tracking algorithm

In this appendix, we collect the tools used to track invariant subspaces in the high-
frequency regime. The basic approach is by now standard [24, 82, 61, 79]; the point here is
to provide an eﬃcient numerical realization with minimal required analytical preparation.

δ > (cid:107)Θ−−(cid:107) + (cid:107)Θ++(cid:107) + 2(cid:112)(cid:107)Θ−+(cid:107)(cid:107)Θ+−(cid:107)

for a system (A.1)–(A.2), satisfying (A.3). Then,

(i) 0 < ζ− < ζ+;
(ii) the invariant subspaces of the limiting coeﬃcient matrices (N + Θ)(±∞) are con-

tained in distinct cones

Ω− = {(cid:107)W−(cid:107)/(cid:107)W+(cid:107) ≤ ζ−}, Ω+ = {(cid:107)W−(cid:107)/(cid:107)W+(cid:107) ≥ ζ+} ;

(iii) denoting by S+ the total eigenspace of (N + Θ)(+∞) contained in Ω+(+∞) and
U− the total eigenspace of (N + Θ)(−∞) contained in Ω−(−∞), the manifolds of
solutions of (A.2) asymptotic to S+ at x = +∞ U− at x = −∞ are separated for
all x, lying in Ω+ and Ω− respectively.
In particular, there exist no solutions of (A.2) asymptotic to S+ at +∞ and to U− at −∞.
Remark A.2. In the case c− < 0, c+ > 0, S+ and U− correspond to the stable subspace at
+∞ and the unstable subspace at −∞ of the limiting constant-coeﬃcient matrices, and we
may conclude nonexistence of decaying solutions of (A.2), or nonvanishing of the associated
Evans function.

Proof. From (A.2), we obtain readily

(A.7a)

(cid:107)W−(cid:107)(cid:48) ≤ c−(cid:107)W−(cid:107) + (cid:107)Θ−−(cid:107)(cid:107)W−(cid:107) + (cid:107)Θ−+(cid:107)(cid:107)W+(cid:107),
(cid:107)W+(cid:107)(cid:48) ≥ c+(cid:107)W+(cid:107) − (cid:107)Θ+−(cid:107)(cid:107)W−(cid:107) − (cid:107)Θ++(cid:107)(cid:107)W+(cid:107) ,

(A.7b)
from which, deﬁning ζ := |W−|/|W+|, we obtain by a straightforward computation the Riccati
equation ζ(cid:48) ≤ P (ζ, x).
Consulting (A.5), we see that ζ(cid:48) < 0 on the interval ζ− < ζ < ζ+, whence Ω− := {ζ ≤ ζ−}
is an invariant region under the forward ﬂow of (A.2); moreover, this region is exponentially
attracting for ζ < ζ+. A symmetric argument yields that Ω+ := {ζ ≥ ζ+} is invariant under
the backward ﬂow of (A.2), and exponentially attracting for ζ > ζ−. Specializing these
observations to the constant-coeﬃcient limiting systems at x = −∞ and x = +∞, we ﬁnd
that the invariant subspaces of the limiting coeﬃcient matrices must lie in Ω− or Ω+. (This
is immediate in the diagonalizable case; the general case follows by a limiting argument.)
By forward (resp. backward) invariance of Ω− (resp. Ω+), under the full, variable-
coeﬃcient ﬂow, we thus ﬁnd that the manifold of solutions initiated along U + at x = −∞
lies for all x in Ω+ while the manifold of solutions initiated in S+ at x = +∞ lies for all x
in Ω−. Since Ω− and Ω+ are distinct, we may conclude that under condition (A.6) there are
(cid:3)
no solutions asymptotic to both U− and S+.

A.2. Numerical block-diagonalization. We now show how to compute the numerical
block diagonalization given in (6.18). We need to choose R to be smooth in x1 so that the
LR(cid:48) term is well deﬁned and well behaved.

Assume that D1/2 has complementary eigenspaces Σ±, corresponding to its stable and

unstable subspaces, with spectral gap

(A.8)

min σ(Σ+) ≥ d+, max σ(Σ−) ≥ d−,

d+ − d− > 0.

38

We reduce numerically to block-diagonal form. Denoting by Π± the associated analytic
spectral projections of D1/2, we may deﬁne bases R± of basis vectors, arranged in columns,

R =(cid:0)R− R+

(cid:1), as solutions of Kato’s ODE [43]

(A.9)
initializing at x = −∞ by some choice of orthonormal bases for each subspace. The solution
of (A.9) may be carried out numerically as described in [19, 40, 9]. Setting L := R−1
completes the computation and yields (6.18).

± = (Π Π(cid:48) − Π(cid:48) Π)±R±,
R(cid:48)

A.3. Numerical symmetrization. We conclude by prescribing a “symmetrizing” trans-
formation converting the spectral gap condition (A.8) into a numerical range condition (A.3)
if this is necessary: that is, if (A.3) does not hold already after block-diagonalization.9

Lemma A.3 (Lyapunov’s Lemma [15]). Suppose that N is a stable (unstable) matrix, i.e.,

Re σ(N) < 0 , (> 0) .

Then, there exists a P positive and symmetric such that

(A.10)

Re(PN) =

1
2

(PN + (PN)∗) < 0 , (> 0) .

The matrix P may be characterized as a solution of the Sylvester equation

PN + N∗P = −Q ,

for some positive (negative) symmetric matrix Q.

Now, suppose that N is block diagonal with the form

(A.11)

N =

(cid:18)N+

(cid:19)

0 N−

,

and that there exist δ± describing a spectral gap between the blocks:

Re σ(N+) ≥ δ+ > δ− ≥ Re σ(N−) .

Re(P+(N+ − c+I)) > 0 .

M+ := Re(P1/2

b(cid:107)β(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)β−1q(cid:107),

whence the ﬁrst inequality follows by comparison with the value at s = 0. The

of the uniform spectral gap of β( ˘ξ, ˘λ), as established in Lemma B.1 below.

Appendix B. Symbolic analysis of β

In this appendix, we verify the spectral information asserted for (6.13) appearing in the
high-frequency analysis of Section 6. This is not logically needed for our numerical study,
where we anyway verify hyperbolicity parameter by parameter in the course of numerical
block-diagonalization. However, it is important in understanding why the method works.
Lemma B.1 (Gu`es et al. [30] ). Fix µ > |η| ≥ 0, ν > 0. For each ﬁxed x1, and on
the range −1 ≤ ξ ≤ 1 and λ = iτ , τ = 1 − ξ2, β is uniformly hyperbolic, i.e., Re σ(β) is
uniformly bounded from zero. This hyperbolicity holds over the entire range of shock strengths
0 ≤ e− ≤ emax.
Proof. By continuity/compactness, it is suﬃcient to verify that β is hyperbolic for each ξ,
λ = iτ , ξ, τ ∈ R. Suppose that −iζ is an eigenvalue of β, or (β + iζ)w = 0, w = (w1, w2)T ,
wj ∈ C3. First, observe that the diagonal β12 block has eigenvalues iˆρτ plus µξ2, ˜µξ2, νξ2,
with modulus bounded by (|τ| + |ξ|2)/C > 0, hence is invertible on the entire parameter
range. Thus, we may solve the w equation β12w2 + iζw1 = 0 to obtain w2 = −iζβ−1
12 w1.
Substituting the above expression for w2 into the w2 equation yields

0 = β21w1 + (iζI3 + β22)w2 =(cid:0)β21 + (iζI3 + β22)(−iζβ−1
12 )(cid:1)w1,
 .

˜η = µ + η ≥ 0, we see that it is ≥ (ξ2 + ζ 2) min{µ, ν}, hence positive deﬁnite for |ξ, ζ| (cid:54)= 0,
which is a contradiction unless ζ = ξ = 0. But, ζ = ξ = 0 would imply τ = 0 by (B.1),
contradicting τ = 1 − ξ2 = 1.
(cid:3)
Remark B.2. The quadratic form (B.2) may be recognized as the Fourier symbol of the dif-
fusion matrices for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations written in (u, v, e) coordinates.
Thus, the argument above relies only on parabolicity in (u, v, e) components of the original
equations, an instance of a more general principle presented in [30].

Appendix C. Computation of the Mach number

A dimensionless quantity measuring shock strength is the Mach number M = u−−s

c− (for a
left-moving shock), where u− is the downwind velocity, s is the shock speed, and c− is the
downwind sound speed. This gives a convenient measure of comparison between standard
versus rescaled coordinates (3.2). Under our normalizations s = 0, u− = 1, this becomes
simply M = c−1
. In the
strong shock limit u+ → u∗, M ∼ (u+ − u∗)−1/2; in the weak shock limit u+ → 1, M → 1.

− = (Γ(1 + Γ)e−)−1/2 or, using e− = (Γ+2)(u+−u∗)

(Γ+2)(u+−u∗)

Appendix D. Computational environment and effort

D.1. Environment. All numerical computations were performed on one of two Mac Pro
workstations. One has 2 Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors with a 2.8 GHz rated CPU and
the other has two 6-Core Intel Xeon processors with a 2.4 GHz rated CPU. Computations
were carried out in the MATLAB-based package STABLAB [5], an open source package
available in the GitHub repository, nonlinear-waves/stablab. Further information is available
on request.

D.2. Eﬀort. Proﬁles: Computation of proﬁles is fast. It takes about 3 seconds to produce
the 19-20 proﬁles used in each of the monatomic and diatomic batch jobs. The high frequency
bounds take roughly 4 minutes of computational time per u+, with roughly 80 minutes of
computational time for an entire batch of 19-20 proﬁles. The low-frequency computations
(“rib-roast”) only run on a single core (not optimized for multi-core processing) and take
roughly 100 minutes for a typical case. Weak shocks take considerably longer given the
length of the domain, and so an entire batch of 19-20 proﬁles took around 50 hours. Finally,
an average Evans function contour takes between 1-3 minutes for 100 contour points. For
an entire batch which includes the adaptive mesh for the particularly winding contours, it
takes roughly 88 hours of computational time for the 900 contours.
