Abstract

Detuning of the fundamental is a way to enhance harmonic generation . By this method, the

wiggler is composed of two segments in such a way that the fundamental resonance of the second

segment to coincide with the third harmonic of the ﬁrst segment of the wiggler to generate extreme

ultraviolet radiation and x-ray emission. A set of coupled, nonlinear, and ﬁrst-order diﬀerential

equations in three dimensions describing the evolution of the electron trajectories and the radiation

ﬁeld with warm beam is solved numerically by CYRUS 3D code in the steady-state for two models

(1) seeded free electron laser (FEL) and (2) shot noise on the electron beam (self-ampliﬁed spon-

taneous emission FEL). Thermal eﬀects in the form of longitudinal velocity spread is considered.

Three-dimensional simulation describes self-consistently the longitudinal spatial dependence of ra-

diation waists, curvatures, and amplitudes together with the evaluation of the electron beam. The

evolutions of the transverse modes are investigated for the fundamental resonance and the third

harmonic. Also, the eﬀective modes of the third harmonic are studied. In this paper, we found that

detuning of the fundamental with shot noise gives more optimistic result than the seeded FEL.

INTRODUCTION

Fourth generation light sources have given us the capability of exploring the molecular and
atomic phenomena. High-gain free electron laser (FEL) ampliﬁers hold great prospects of
reaching coherent high power radiation in the x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
In recent years, a great eﬀort of researchers has been devoted to study the process of higher
harmonic generation in achieving lasing at shorter wavelengths. A possible way for obtaining
x-ray wavelength is by using nonlinear harmonic generation [1–6].

Radiation of the electron beam in the planar wiggler contains odd harmonics but the
output power at the hth harmonic is rather small and is of the order of 10−h times the
power of the fundamental [1, 3–5, 7]. Various schemes have been proposed to enhance the
harmonic intensity, these are high-gain harmonic generation[8–12], echo-enabled harmonic
generation using the beam echo eﬀect [13, 14], and the two-beam FEL for frequency up-
conversion [15–17]. Another technique is two harmonic undulators in which an on axis ﬁeld
oscillates with integer multiples of spatial periods and with diﬀerent orthogonal polarizations
[18]. The analysis of this method is achieved with PROMETEO code developed by Dattoli
and coworkers [19], which has been benchmarked with MEDUSA. Recently, McNeil et al.
[20] proposed a harmonic lasing method for FEL ampliﬁers that can amplify the higher
harmonics by suppressing the interaction at the fundamental resonance. They showed that
this conﬁguration can signiﬁcantly extend the operation band of user facilities.

Reference [20] has outlined two methods for suppressing the interaction at the fundamen-
tal resonance while allowing the third harmonic to evolve to saturation. The ﬁrst method is
based upon the shifting of the phase of the fundamental between the wiggler segments, which
can be controlled by various techniques [21]. For the hth harmonic, this phase shift should
be 2πn/h, where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is an integer number and h = 3, 5, 7, . . . is the harmonic
number. Freund and coworkers [22] investigated the eﬀects of varying the gap lengths be-
tween the wiggler segments and varying the electron beam β function on the third harmonic
generation with phase shift of 2π/3. The second method is the detuning of the fundamental
by considering two diﬀerent segments for the wiggler. Two segments of the wiggler have dif-
ferent magnetic ﬁeld intensity while the wiggler period, λw, and the initial average electron
beam energy,γ, are kept constant. It has been suggested in Ref. [21] that a combined use of
the phase shifting and detuning of the fundamental can reduce the bandwidth and increase

2

the brilliance of the x-ray beam at saturation. In Ref. [23], detuning of the fundamental has
been compared for the nonaveraged and averaged methods in one-dimension and it is shown
that there is a remarkable agreement between the averaged and nonaveraged simulations for
the evolution of the third harmonic.

The method of detuning of fundamental has not been studied in three-dimensions in the
nonaveraged procedure. The 3D averaged wiggler method for detuning of the fundamental
method was studied in [21]; they showed that the gain length of detuning for the fundamen-
tal is larger than that of the phase shift method (in the case of negligible energy spread) and
this result is consistent with the 1D theory [20]. They also showed that 3D eﬀects actually
improve the situation and makes harmonic lasing even more attractive compared to the 1D
theory. In this paper, three-dimensional features such as diﬀraction, radiation guiding, and
the evolution of transverse mode have been considered. The guiding of laser light by an
electron beam (optical guiding) in an FEL occurs in the exponential gain regime [24–26]
when the coherent interaction between the source electron beam and the electromagnetic
ﬁeld introduces an inward curvature in the phase front of the light, which refracts it back
toward the lasing core of the electron beam. During the ampliﬁcation, the electron beam
that propagates through the wiggler operates simultaneously as a guiding structure that
suppresses the diﬀraction, reducing the transverse power losses, and enhancing the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation. The evolution of transverse modes is important in planning for
the future user facilities that intend to employ radiation from this system [27].

The thermal eﬀect of the electron beam is particularly important for higher harmonics,
because they are more sensitive to the energy spread compared to the fundamental [7, 28, 30].
The energy spread is considered as a Gaussian energy distribution in MEDUSA code for
nonlinear harmonic generation [29]. Also, in reference [21], the energy spread is considered
and the gain length for the detuning of the fundamental is compared with the third harmonic
in conventional FEL. The eﬀect of optimizing the β function at the third harmonic in the
phase shift method is investigated in Ref. [22] by considering the thermal eﬀects, where the
β function is adjusted depending on to the energy spread. In this paper, we consider the
thermal eﬀects only in the longitudinal direction and ignore thermal eﬀects in the transverse
momentum, because the longitudinal spread is more eﬀective than a transverse spread in
reducing the growth rate [31, 32].

The initial radiation signal in a single-pass ampliﬁer conﬁguration based upon the prin-

3

ciple of self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE) originates from the temporally random
microbunching present on the electron beam as they enter the wiggler. SASE ampliﬁers
start up from the spontaneous emission due to shot noise on the electron beam, which is
due to the random ﬂuctuations in the phase distribution of the electrons [33–35]. The seed
power for the fundamental overwhelms the shot noise, whereas it treats correctly in order
to model the initial start up of harmonic radiation. Penman and McNeil discussed a partic-
ular algorithm used in one-dimensional (1D) approximation (in their 1D code) in order to
simulate FEL start up noise [36]. In Ref. [37], the shot noise algorithm is obtained for multi-
dimensional FEL simulation codes. Freund and coworkers [39] discussed and compared two
diﬀerent shot noise models that are implemented in both 1D wiggler-averaged (PERSEO)
and non-wiggler-averaged (MEDUSA 1D) simulation codes, and a 3D non-wiggler-averaged
(MEDUSA) formulation. They found out that there is a very good agreement between
PERSEO and MEDUSA 1D for the evolution at the fundamental and harmonics. They also
showed that the harmonics saturate slightly prior to the saturation point of the fundamen-
tal. Also, the high gain FEL, in the SASE regime, operating with segmented undulators
is studied in Ref.
[38] using a set of semianalytical formulas, with the eﬀect of the energy
spread taken into account.

The aim of this paper is to present a three-dimensional simulation of the emission at
the fundamental and third harmonic in the non-wiggler-averaged-orbit approximation of the
harmonic lasing FEL with source-dependent expansion[40–43]. Therefore, the source func-
tion is incorporated self-consistently into the functional dependence of the radiation waist,
the radiation wavefront curvature, and the radiation amplitude instead of using the usual
modal expansion consisting of vacuum Laguerre-Gaussian or Hermite-Gaussian functions.
It is important to emphasize that no wiggler average is imposed on the orbit equations.
Therefore, It is possible to treat the injection of the beam into the wiggler, with the ease
of inclusion of external focusing or dispersive magnetic components in the beam line and
the facility for using an actual magnetic ﬁeld in the numerical solution. The third harmonic
lasing is considered so that the operating wavelength is in the EUV domain. The slippage of
the radiation with respect to the long electron bunch is ignored. Also, we present numerical
results for the fundamental resonance and the third harmonic including shot noise on the
electron beam. We found that in many cases, SASE FEL gives more optimistic result than
seeded FEL in detuning of the fundamental method. For example, one of the results of

4

our studies is that the lowest mode in shot noise is more eﬀective at the saturation point
compared to that in the seeded FEL.

The code for this purpose is named CYRUS 3D, which was developed by PhD students in
Amirkabir University and Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)[44]. This
code follows MEDUSA 3D [29] formulation.

The organization of this paper is as follows. The simulations conducted using the CYRUS
3D simulation code is brieﬂy described in Sec. II. A general discussion of the retuned wiggler
parameter is given in Sec. III. The simulation results for the fundamental resonance and
the third harmonic in this system for seeded FEL and SASE FEL are discussed in Sec. IV.
In Sec. V, the summary and discussion are presented.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE SIMULATION CODE

The simulation code for three-dimensional non-wiggler averaged-orbit formulation is
CYRUS 3D code, which is written in standard Fortran 95. This code is time independent
with harmonics and thermal eﬀects taken into account. It models planar wiggler generated
by magnets with parabolically shaped pole faces for additional focusing; hence, we can write

where Bw represents the wiggler amplitude, kw = 2π/λw is the wiggler wave number corre-
sponding to the wiggler period λw. This type of wiggler has enough focusing on an electron
beam in both directions in the plane transverse. And the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented
as a superposition of Gauss-Hermit modes in the slowly varying amplitude approximation.

αh is related to the curvature of the phase front, ω is the fundamental frequency, and
c.c. denotes the complex conjugate. Electron trajectories are integrated using the three-
dimensional (3D) Lorentz force equations in the magnetostatic and electromagnetic ﬁelds.
It is important to emphasize that no average is performed over the Lorentz force equation.
So, Cyrus can simulate the injection of the electrons into each segment of the wiggler.

This code like MEDUSA 3D employs nonaverage equations. The details of the formulation
[29]. We simulate the detuning of the fundamental FEL in which the
is explained in Ref.
wiggler consists of two segments. In the harmonic lasing FEL the wiggler segments have
two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld strengths but the same wavelength λw.

The thermal eﬀect of the electron beam on the harmonic gain is particularly important.
The kinetic theory has shown that the thermal FEL lowers the growth rate [31, 45]. Higher
harmonics are more sensitive to the energy spread than the fundamental one [4, 20, 28]. It
was concluded in Ref. [20] that harmonic lasing with phase shifting is more sensitive to the
emittance and the energy spread than the harmonic lasing with detuning of the fundamental.
In Refs. [32, 46], a spread in the traverse momentum with constant total energy is considered.
They showed that a longitudinal spread is more eﬀective than a transverse spread in reducing
the growth rate.

To consider eﬀects of the energy spread, we assume longitudinal spread without any
spread in the transverse momentum. So, the initial conditions is chosen to model the axial
injection of the electron beam with the energy in the form of a Gaussian distribution function
that is peaked around the initial energy of the beam. We choose the thermal distribution
function as

III. RETUNED WIGGLER PARAMETER

We consider the retuned fundamental resonant wavelength by changes in the wiggler
magnetic ﬁeld alone. The wiggler is composed of two segments and the wavelength of
the fundamental resonance of the second segment is decreased by reducing the magnetic
ﬁeld strength of the second segment of the wiggler.
In this case, for the ﬁrst segment,
the rms wiggler parameter is a1 and the fundamental resonant wavelength is λ1 giving the
harmonic resonant wavelengths as λh = λ1/h , h = 3, 5, 7, . . .. In the second segment, the
rms wiggler parameter is reset to an so that the new resonant fundamental wavelength is
the nth harmonic of the ﬁrst segment, λ(cid:48)
1 = λn. For the assumed ﬁxed beam energy and
wiggler period, the retuned wiggler parameter an is obtain from the FEL resonance relation

√

Obviously, a1 must be larger than ac =

n − 1 as there are no real solutions for an for
a1 < ac. So, the wiggler can not be reduced to a fundamental wavelength λ(cid:48)
1 = λn for
a1 < ac. We consider tuning the harmonic interaction by decreasing the wiggler magnetic
ﬁeld; it is clear that this is impractical for an operating X-ray FEL.

IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

Self-consistent ﬁrst-order nonlinear diﬀerential equations are solved numerically using the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm subject to the appropriate initial conditions and in the
time independent approximation where the pulse length is much longer than the slippage
length over the course of the wiggler. The particle averages are carried out using a Gaussian
quadrature technique in each of the degrees of freedom (x0, y0, ψ0, ϕ0, pz0,γ0). The number
of Gauss-Hermite modes that are needed in the code depends on each particular example.
The self-guiding eﬀects of the electron beam in an FEL during exponential gain become
dominant over the diﬀraction, and the balance depends on the Rayleigh length, the growth
rate, and the evolution of the beam envelope. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a suitable
basis set in order to determine the optical mode content. The number of modes that are
determined by an empirical procedure in which successive simulation runs are made with an
increasing number of modes until convergence of the saturation power and saturation length
are achieved.

8

The parameters for the electron beam, the wiggler, and the radiation in the simulation
are as follows. The electron beam has the relativistic factor of 964, a peak current of 300
A, an initial radius of 0.01495 cm, and an energy spread of 0.1% . The wiggler period is 3.3
cm and exhibits a peak of on-axis amplitude equal to 10.06 KG. An entry taper region is
Nw = 10 wiggler periods in length which is necessary in order to inject the electrons into
the steady-state trajectories. Using these beams and wiggler parameters, the fundamental
resonance is at a wavelength of 102.9 nm in the 1D resonance formula. Because of the
betatron motion in three dimensions, fundamental resonance is found at the wavelength of
103.6 nm, which is seeded with a 10 W of optical power. The third harmonic wavelength
is at 34.5 nm and starts from zero initial power. The initial radiation waists are 0.037 cm
and the initial alpha parameters are chosen to be zero. The initial state of electron beams
is chosen to model the injection of an axisymmetric electron beams with the ﬂattop density
proﬁles, i.e., σ⊥ = 1. For unbunched electron beam, the particles are uniformly distributed
in phase.

In this case, we assume a seed power for the fundamental of 10 KW and include the third
harmonic, which starts from zero initial power. The fundamental resonance is suppressed
by reducing the wiggler magnetic ﬁeld strength at L1 = 10 m with a3 = 0.97 while the third
harmonic grows to saturation. In Ref. [23], it has been shown that the saturation power and
saturation length of the third harmonic radiation depends on the length of the ﬁrst segment
of the wiggler L1. Since the main bunching for the electron beam in the ﬁrst segment of
the wiggler corresponds to the fundamental resonance the electron beam in the beginning
of the second segment of the wiggler, in which the third harmonic of the ﬁrst segment of
the wiggler is a seed for the second segment, is not uniformly distributed. This diﬀerence
in the distribution of the electrons at diﬀerent lengths of the ﬁrst segment of the wiggler
leads to changes in the saturation power and saturation length in the second segment of the
wiggler, compared to the conventional wiggler. The optimum length of the ﬁrst segment
of the wiggler is determined by a successive runs of the code until an optimized saturation
power and saturation length of the third harmonic are obtained.

In Fig. 1, the power of the fundamental resonance (solid line) and the third harmonic
(dashed line) are plotted as functions of the distance through the wiggler. The intensity of the
shorter wavelength is larger than the intensity of the fundamental wavelength. This means
that by reducing the wiggler magnetic ﬁeld, the fundamental resonance will be suppressed

(dashed line).

and the third harmonic of the ﬁrst segment of the wiggler is a seed for the fundamental
harmonic of the second segment of the wiggler leading to higher power. The fundamental
resonance in Fig. 1 is suppressed at z = 10 m with the power of 2.7 × 107 W . The third
harmonic has three distinct regimes, a small gain regime that ends at z = 6.6 m, exponential
growth, and approach to the saturation point at z = 21.5 m with the power of 4.8 × 107 W .
Evolution of the radiation amplitude in the transverse plane is shown in Figs. 2(a) and
2(b) as a function of z for the fundamental mode and the third harmonic, respectively. Due
to the normalization of transverse proﬁle to peak intensity of 1, these ﬁgures do not show
the ampliﬁcation of the radiation; however, they show that the proﬁle of the amplitude
of radiation in the transverse plane gets narrower when the radiation moves toward the
saturation point. It needs to be mentioned that this mode narrowing is stronger for the
third harmonic. Figure 2(b) shows that the transverse intensity proﬁle of the third harmonic
initially widens up to the point where the small signal gain ends at z = 6.6 m. The radiation
undergoes diﬀraction in the small gain region; it also experiences rapid focusing due to the
gain guiding at the onset of the exponential growth [25, 26], leading to the narrowing of the
transverse intensity proﬁle. Therefore, it seems that the transverse proﬁle of the radiation
is guided by the exponentially growing amplitude. In order to ﬁnd the more precise position
of the saturation point, rather than using the intensity proﬁle of Fig. 1, we can look at the
point where mode narrowing stops and the intensity proﬁle widens. After the saturation
point the radiation waist begins to grow as the gain guiding is no longer eﬀective there.

harmonic wavelength (b) in the x direction for y = 0.

Before the saturation point, strong Gaussian proﬁles with gentle ripples on their outskirts
indicate that T EM00 is dominant in this region. This result is also shown in Fig. 5 in more
detail. However, additional modes tend to grow, beyond the saturation point.

In Fig. 3, the radiation waist of the fundamental resonance and third harmonic are
plotted. The radiation waist for the third harmonic is observed to expand, from its initial
size, in the small signal region because of vacuum diﬀraction. This can also be seen in Fig.
2(b). In the exponential growth region, optical guiding becomes strong and focusing is rapid.
Finally, the radiation waist expands rapidly as the saturation point is reached. The radiation
waist for the fundamental resonance behaves to some extent diﬀerently, compared to the
third harmonic, and grows faster at the suppression point. Here, the radiation waist of the
third harmonic is smaller than that of the fundamental resonance in the exponential growth
region but the radiation waist of the third harmonic is larger than that of the fundamental
resonance in the exponential growth region in the conventional FEL [29]. The curvature of
the phase front,α, is shown in Fig. 4. Both fundamental and the third harmonic, which are
plane waves at the entrance to the wiggler at z = 0, deviate from plane waves as radiation
travels along the wiggler. The curvature of the phase front of the third harmonic increases
abruptly as saturation occurs but for the fundamental resonance, it increases rapidly at the
suppression point.

It is interesting to study the composition of the optical modes (eﬀective higher modes )
of the third harmonic. The composition process will introduce higher-order modes. Figure

the third harmonic. Figure 5 indicates that a purely (0,0) mode exists at the beginning of
the wiggler.

Table I shows the composition of signiﬁcant modes of the third harmonic at diﬀerent
points of the wiggler. It can be seen that the composition of the lowest order mode T EM0,0
is 84.7% at the suppression point and decreases to 76% at the saturation point. It is found
that the composition is 7% for either modes T EM20 or T EM02 at the suppression point
and increases to 11% at the saturation point. Therefore, the lowest order T EM0,0 mode is
dominant and modes which are shown in Table I have a noticeable contribution and the rest

intensity of the lowest mode decreases but the intensity of higher modes increase at the
saturation point.
In other words, the share of higher modes increases in higher energy
spread compared to that in the low energy spread.

For the shot noise, we apply an appropriate initial condition on the initial phase of
macroparticles. Also, we assume a seed power for the fundamental of 0 KW . The fun-

ﬁeld strength at L1 = 11 m. In Fig. 8, we plot the evolution of powers in the fundamental
and the third harmonic as a function of the distance through the system. It can be seen
that powers of the fundamental and the third harmonic initially grow exponentially because
of start up of noise. The growth of the fundamental resonance in Fig. 8 is suppressed at
z = 11 m with the power of 5.6× 106 W . The small gain regime of the third harmonic starts
from z = 1.3 m to 10 m. After exponential growth regime, it saturates at z = 22.8 m with
the power of 6.3× 108 W . We observe that the saturation length and the saturation power of
the third harmonic is considerably increased compared to that of the case of seeded FEL. A
comparison between the seeded FEL and SASE FEL is shown in Fig. 9 for the conventional
FEL. In the conventional FEL, the saturation length of the fundamental resonance in the
seeded FEL is lower than that of the SASE FEL.

The transverse intensity proﬁle and the evolution of the radiation waist are presented in
Fig. 10 and 11. The eﬀect of optical guiding due to the electron beam is evident. As it is
shown in Fig.10, the transverse intensity is narrower than that of the seeded FEL. Initially,
the radiation spot size for the fundamental resonance and the third harmonic is large due to
the start up from the shot noise. In the small signal regime, the radiation waist of the third
harmonic increases. After that and at the onset of exponential growth, the radiation waist
experiences rapid focusing and decreases; it remains small during the exponential growth
before expanding at the saturation point . The curvature of the phase front for the third
harmonic at the small signal, in Fig. 12, increases abruptly but it decreases at the beginning

of the exponential growth region and behaves more like a plane wave as it moves on. Also,
at the saturation point, the curvature of the phase front is lower (α3 ≈ 1.5) than that in the
seeded FEL (α3 ≈ 7).

The composition of the optical modes of the third harmonic at the beginning, suppression,
and saturation point is shown in Fig. 13 and Tabel II. It is evident that the composition of
the modes at the beginning is low because there is no coherent radiation at the beginning
of the wiggler. Also, the composition of the lowest order mode is 84.06% at the suppression
point and increases to 93.86% at the saturation point. And it is found that compositions for

modes T EM20 and T EM02 are 6.4% and 5.6% at the suppression point, respectively, and
they decrease to 2.6% at the saturation point for both modes. It is clear that mode T EM00
is dominant at the saturation point, which is reported in Table II. At the saturation point,
the composition of the lowest mode in SASE FEL is larger than that of in the seeded FEL
and higher modes are less eﬀective in SASE FEL compared to those in the seeded FEL.
Because in the SASE FEL, the power of radiation levels oﬀ completely at the saturation
point. However, the radiation power of seeded FEL has a very small growth at the saturation
point, therefor, higher number of modes also contribute to the composition at the saturation
point compared to the higher modes of radiation in the SASE FEL.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we analyzed detuning of the fundamental to enhance harmonic generation
in x-ray FELs. It works well in the frame work of the realistic 3D model of the FEL process
by using a nonaveraged simulations, which is named CYRUS 3D. In the absence of slippage

harmonic)

(steady-state simulation), the variation of radiation waists, curvatures, and amplitudes for
fundamental resonance and the third harmonic are studied. Transverse mode evolution of
the fundamental and the third harmonic are investigated in more details. The radiation
power of the third harmonic is larger than that of the fundamental resonance in contrast to
the nonlinear harmonic generation. Also, the composition of signiﬁcant modes of the third
harmonic is presented which shows that the lowest order mode is dominant. We discussed
shot noise in harmonic lasing FEL that treats the start up of both the fundamental and
harmonic generation. The saturation power of the third harmonic is increased considerably
compared to that of the seeded FEL case while increase of the saturation length is negligible
in SASE FEL. Also T EM00 mode is more eﬀective at the saturation point in SASE FEL
compared to that in the seeded FEL .
