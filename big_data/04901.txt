Dilations of semigroups on von Neumann
algebras and noncommutative Lp-spaces

Cédric Arhancet

Abstract

We prove that any w∗-continuous semigroup of factorizable Markov maps acting on
a von Neumann algebra M equipped with a state can be dilated by a group of Markov
∗-automorphisms in a manner analogous to the discrete case of one factorizable Markov
operator. We also give a version of this result for strongly continuous semigroups of op-
erators acting on noncommutative Lp-spaces, examples of semigroups to which the results
of this paper can be applied and applications of these results to functional calculus of the
generators of these semigroups.

1 Introduction

The study of dilations of operators is of central importance in operator theory and has a long
tradition in functional analysis. Suppose 1 < p < ∞. A classical result from seventies essentially
due to Akcoglu [AkS] (see also [Pel]) says that a positive contraction T : Lp(Ω) → Lp(Ω) on
an Lp-space Lp(Ω) admits a positive isometric dilation U on a bigger space Lp-space than the
initial Lp-space, i.e there exists another measure space Ω′, two positive contractions J : Lp(Ω) →
Lp(Ω′) and P : Lp(Ω′) → Lp(Ω) and a positive invertible isometry U : Lp(Ω′) → Lp(Ω′) such
that T k = P U kJ for any integer k > 0. Note that in this situation, J is an isometric embedding
whereas JP is a contractive projection.

Later, Fendler [Fen1] proved a continuous version of this result for any strongly continuous
semigroup (Tt)t>0 of positive contractions on an Lp-space Lp(Ω). More precisely, this theorem
says that there exists a measure space Ω′, two positive contractions J : Lp(Ω) → Lp(Ω′) and
P : Lp(Ω′) → Lp(Ω) and a strongly continuous group of positive invertible isometries (Ut)t∈R
on Lp(Ω′) such that Tt = P UtJ for any t > 0, see also [Fen2].

In the noncommutative setting, measure spaces and Lp-spaces are replaced by von Neumann
algebras and noncommutative Lp-spaces and positive maps by completely positive maps. In
their remarkable paper [JLM], Junge and Le Merdy showed that there exists no “reasonable”
analog of Akcoglu result for completely positive contractions acting on noncommutative Lp-
It is a striking diﬀerence with the world of classical (=commutative) Lp-spaces of
spaces.
measure spaces.

Independently, Kümmerer, Maasen, Haagerup and Musat introduced and studied dilations
of well-behaved completely positive unital operators on noncommutative probability spaces
(=von Neumann algebras equipped with states), the so-called Markov operators [Kum1] [Kum2]

[Kum3] [KuM] [HaM] [HaM2]. These dilations induce dilations on the associated noncommu-
tative Lp-spaces. The following deﬁnition of these operators is considered in [AnD], [HaM] and
[Ric].

Deﬁnition 1.1 Let (M, φ) and (N, ψ) be von Neumann algebras equipped with normal faithful
states φ and ψ, respectively. A linear map T : M → N is called a (φ, ψ)-Markov map if

(1) T is completely positive

(2) T is unital

(3) ψ ◦ T = φ

(4) T ◦ σφ

t = σψ

t ◦ T , for all t ∈ R, where (σφ

t )t∈R and (σψ

t )t∈R denote the automorphism goups

of the states φ and ψ, respectively.

In particular, when (M, φ) = (N, ψ), we say that T is a φ-Markov map. Such an operator T
induces a contraction T : Lp(M ) → Lp(M ) on the associated noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M )
for any 1 6 p < ∞, see for exemple [AnD, lemma 2.4].

The following deﬁnition is essentiallly due to Kummerer (see [Kum2, Deﬁnitions 2.1.1].

Deﬁnition 1.2 Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a normal faithful ﬁnite state φ and let
T : M → M be a φ-Markov map. We say that T is dilatable if there exists a von Neumann
algebra N with a normal faithful state ψ, a ∗-automorphism U of N leaving ψ invariant and a
(φ, ψ)-Markov ∗-monomorphism J : M → N satisfying

T n = EU kJ,

k > 0.

where E = J ∗ : N → M is the canonical faithful normal conditional expectation preserving the
states associated with J.

Note that Haagerup and Musat [HaM, Theorem 4.4] have succeeded in characterizing dilat-
able Markov maps. Indeed, they proved that a φ-Markov map T is dilatable if and only if T is
factorizable in the sense of [AnD].

Now, we introduce the continuous version of this deﬁnition from [Arh2, Deﬁnition 1.3]

inspired by Fendler result, see also [KuM, Deﬁnition page 4].

Deﬁnition 1.3 Let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful state φ. Let
(Tt)t>0 be a w∗-continuous semigroup of φ-Markov maps on M . We say that the semigroup
is dilatable if there exist a von Neumann algebra N equipped with a normal faithful state ψ, a
w*-continuous group (Ut)t∈R of ∗-automorphisms of N , a ∗-monomorphism J : M → N such
that each Ut is ψ-Markov and J is (φ, ψ)-Markov satisfying

(1.1)

Tt = EUtJ,

t > 0,

where E = J ∗ : N → M is the canonical faithful normal conditional expectation preserving the
states associated with J.

Note that such a dilation induces an isometric dilation similar to the one of Fendler theorem
for the strongly continuous semigroup induced by the semigroup (Tt)t>0 on the associated
noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M ) for any 1 6 p < ∞.

Our ﬁrst main result is the following theorem:

2

Theorem 1.4 let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful state φ. Let
(Tt)t>0 be a w∗-semigroup of dilatable φ-Markov maps on M . Then the semigroup (Tt)t>0 is
dilatable.

This result can be applied with some semigroups of Fourier multipliers, see section 5. Our
second main result is Theorem 4.4 which is a variant of this result for noncommutative Lp-
spaces useful even for non-σ-ﬁnite von Neumann algebras. Finally, we refer to the paper in
preparation [JRS] for related results.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 3 gives a proof of Theorem 1.4. In the following
section 4, we describe and prove a noncommutative Lp analog of this result. In section 5, we
give examples of dilatable semigroups. Finally, we conclude in section 6 with some applications
of our results to functional calculus.

2 Preliminaries

Noncommutative Lp-spaces We use Haagerup noncommutative Lp-spaces. We refer to the
survey [PiX], [Ray2] and [Pis1] for more information.

Markov operators Note that a linear map T : M → N satisfying conditions (1) − (3) of
Deﬁnition 1.1 is automatically normal.
If, moreover, condition (4) is satisﬁed, then it was
proved in [AcC] (see also [AnD, Lemma 2.5]) that there exists a unique completely positive
unital map T ∗ : N → M such that

(2.1)

φ(cid:0)T ∗(y)x(cid:1) = ψ(cid:0)yT (x)(cid:1),

x ∈ M, y ∈ N.

It is easy to show that T ∗ is a (ψ, φ)-Markov map. Finally, we say that a φ-Markov map
T : M → M is selfadjoint if T = T ∗. Finally, it is not diﬃcult to prove that a (φ, ψ)-Markov
∗-homomorphism is always injective.
Indeed, suppose that T : M → N is a ∗-homorphism
preserving the states. Let x ∈ M +. Suppose T (x) = 0. We have φ(x) = ψ(T (x)) = 0. Hence
x = 0 by the positivity of T and the faithfulness. Now if y ∈ M satisﬁes T (y) = 0. We have
T (y)∗T (y) = 0 hence T (y∗y) = 0 since T is a ∗-homomorphism. Hence y∗y = 0. Then y = 0.

ℓ∞(N, Xn) be the Banach space of all sequences (xn)n>1 ∈Q∞

Ultraproducts of Banach spaces Let (Xn)n>1 be a sequence of Banach spaces, and let
n=1 Xn with supn>1 kxnkXn < ∞
with the norm k(xn)n>1k = supn>1 kankXn . Let U be free ultraﬁlter on N . The Banach
space ultraproduct (Xn)U is deﬁned as the quotient ℓ∞(N, Xn)/JU , where JU is the closed
subspace of all (xn)n>1 ∈ ℓ∞(N, Xn) which satisﬁes limn→U kxnkXn = 0. An element of (Xn)U
represented by (xn)n>1 ∈ ℓ∞(N, E) is written as (xn)U . For any (xn)U ∈ (Xn)U , one has
k(xn)U k = limn→U kxnkXn .
If 1 < p < ∞, the ultraproduct of noncommutative Lp-spaces
is a noncommutative Lp-space, see [Ray1]. However, the Banach space ultraproduct of von
Neumann algebras is not a von Neumann algebra in general.

If (Tn : Xn → Yn)n>1 is a bounded sequence of bounded linear operators, we can deﬁne the
ultraproduct map T : (Xn)U → (Yn)U , (xn)U 7→ (Tnxn)U . We refer to [DJT, section 8] for more
information.

Let us now deﬁne the (Ocneanu) ultraproduct (Mn, φn)U of a sequence (Mn, φn)n>1 of σ-
ﬁnite von Neumann algebras equipped with normal faithful states φn with respect to a free
n=1 Mn such

ultraﬁlter U over N. Deﬁne ℓ∞(N, Mn) the C*-algebra of sequences (an)n>1 ∈Q∞

be free ultraﬁlter on N . We let

n→U

0o ,

MU (Mn, φn) :=(cid:8)(xn)n>1 ∈ ℓ∞(N, Mn) : (xn)nIU ⊂ IU , and IU (xn)n ⊂ IU(cid:9).

It is then apparent that MU (Mn, φn) is a C∗-algebra (with pointwise operations and supermum
norm) in which IU (Mn, φn) is a closed ideal. We then deﬁne

(Mn, φn)U := MU (Mn, φn)/IU (Mn, φn)

(the quotient C∗-algebra). Moreover, (Mn, φn)U is a W∗-algebra. We denote the image of
(xn)n>1 ∈ MU (Mn, φn) in (Mn, φn)U as (xn)U . Finally, the following deﬁnes a normal faithful
state (ϕn)ω on (Mn, ϕn)ω:

(ϕn)U(cid:0)(xn)U(cid:1) := lim

n→U

φn(xn),

(xn)U ∈ (Mn, φn)U .

See [AHW], [AnH] and [Pis2, Section 9.10] for more information.
Similarly to [Ued, page 352], if (Jn : Mn → Nn)n>1 is a sequence of (φn, ψn)-Markov ∗-
monomorphism then it is not diﬃcult to prove that we can deﬁne the ultraproduct map
(Jn)U : (Mn)U → (Nn)U , (xn)U 7→ (Jnxn)U which is a (φU , ψU )-Markov ∗-monomorphism.
Indeed the Jn’s induce a ∗-homomorphism J = ⊕Jn : ℓ∞(N, Mn) → ℓ∞(N, Nn). Moreover
it is easy to check that if (xn)n>1 ∈ MU (Mn, φn) then (Jn(xn))n>1 ∈ MU (Nn, ψn) and if
(an)n>1 ∈ IU (Mn, φn) then (Jn(an))n>1 ∈ IU (Nn, ψn). The restriction of ⊕Jn gives a map
MU (Mn, φn) → MU (Nn, ψn). The quotient map is the ultraproduct map (Jn)U . Moreover,
if En : Nn → Mn is the canonical faithful normal conditional expectation preserving the states
associated with Jn then the equation

gives rise to a well-deﬁned normal faithful conditional expectation (En)U : (Nn)U → (Mn)U such
that (φn)U ◦ (En)U = (ψn)U .

(En)U(cid:0)(xn)U(cid:1) =(cid:0)En(xn)(cid:1)U

Representations of groups Let X be a Banach space. Let π : G → B(X) be a representa-

tion of a group G on X. Then we say that π is bounded when sup(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:13)π(t)(cid:13)(cid:13) : t ∈ G(cid:9) < ∞.

Convexity A normed linear space X is locally uniformly convex if for any ε > 0 and any
x ∈ X with kxk = 1 there exists δ(ε, x) > 0 such that kyk = 1 and kx+yk
> 1 − δ(ε, x) imply
kx − yk 6 ε. We say that a normed linear space X is strictly convex if for any x, y ∈ X the
equalities kx+yk
2 = kxk = kyk imply x = y. It is clear from the deﬁnition that uniform convexity
implies local uniform convexity and strictly convexity.

Semi-groups of operators Let X be a Banach space. Recall that a semigroup (Tt)t>0 of
operators on X is strongly continuous if the map t 7→ Ttx is continuous from R+ into X for any
x ∈ X.

Let X be a dual Banach space with predual X∗. Recall that a semigroup (Tt)t>0 of operators

on X is w∗-continuous if the map t 7→(cid:10)y, Ttx(cid:11)X∗,X is continuous on R+ for any x ∈ X and any

y ∈ X ∗. Recall that the weak* topology on B(X) is the topology of pointwise convergence on
X endowed with the σ(X, X∗)-topology.

We need some notions and results of the papers [DLG1] and [DLG2]. Recall that a non-
empty subset D of an algebraic semigroup S is called a two-sided ideal if S D ⊂ D and if
DS ⊂ D. If S is a semigroup, the intersection of all the two-sided ideals of S is called the
kernel of S . If S be a compact (Hausdorﬀ) semitopological semigroup, that is a semigroup
with separately continuous semigroup operations, then it is known [DLG1, Theorem 2.3] that
its kernel is non-empty.

Let π : G → B(X) be a bounded representation of a topological group G on a reﬂexive

Banach space X. Then we denote by

Xc = {x ∈ X : s 7→ π(s)x is continuous from G to X}

the weak operator topology of the convex hull ofTV ∈V(e) {π(g) : g ∈ V }

the subspace of continuously translating elements of X for the representation π. Let V(e) be
the set of all neighbourhoods V of the identity e of G. We then set S c(π) be the closure in
, endowed with the
weak operator topology and called the convex semigroup of π over the identity e. Then it is
known [DLG2, Lemma 2.3] that S c(π) is a compact semitopological semigroup. A consequence
of [DLG1, Theorem 7.2] is that the kernel K(π) of S c(π) consists entirely of projections. The
results [DLG2, Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 3.1] give

wo

and π : G → B(X) be a bounded representation of a topological group G such that kπtkB(X) −−−→

1. Then the kernel K(π) of the convex semigroup S c(π) of π contains a unique projection Q.

By [DLG2, Lemma 2.4], if K(π) contains a unique projection Q then Q is a bounded pro-

jection of X on Xc with Qπt = πtQ for any t ∈ G.

Accumulation points Let (xi)i∈I be a net in a topological space X. An accumulation point

of the net (xi)i∈I is an element of the intersectionTF ∈F F where

F =(cid:8)F ⊂ X : there exists i0 ∈ I such that {xi : i > i0} ⊂ F(cid:9)

or equivalently a limit of some subnet of (xi)i∈I .

3 Dilations of semigroups on von Neumann algebras

Suppose that X is a dual Banach space X with predual X∗ and that G is a topological group.
Then, we deﬁne

Theorem 2.4]. Here, we use the fact that a unital completely positive map T : M → M on a
von Neumann algebra M is a Schwarz map [Pau, Proposition 3.3], i.e:

x ∈ M.

be applied to noncommutative Lp-spaces.

The following lemma is a variant of the above Lemma.

Lemma 3.6 Let M, and N be von Neumann algebras equipped with normal faithful states φ and
ψ. Let (Tt)t>0 be a w∗-continuous semigroup of φ-Markov maps on M . Let (Ut)t∈Q be a group of

Moreover J induces an isometric embedding of Lp(M ) into Lp(N ) and E a contractive map

Then it is not diﬃcult to complete this proof.

Now we can prove our ﬁrst main result. We use a similar strategy to the one of Fendler
[Fen1]. However, the method of [Fen1] does not apply identically to our context. We adapt
instead some trick of the proof of [AFM, Corollary 6.2] using some results from the papers
[DLG1] and [DLG2].

Theorem 3.7 let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful state φ. Let
(Tt)t>0 be a w∗-semigroup of dilatable φ-Markov map on M . Then the semigroup (Tt)t>0 is
dilatable.

a singleton {E′} where E′ : eN → eN a faithful normal conditional expectation preserving ϕU
By Proposition 3.2, the subspace eNw∗ of weak∗ continuously translating elements of fM of the
representation Q → B(cid:0)eN(cid:1), t 7→ eSt is equal to the ﬁxed point subspace of S :
Hence the von Neumann algebra Ran E′ is equal to eNw∗ and is invariant under the operator eSt
for any t ∈ Q by Proposition 3.3. By Proposition 3.6, the range Ran(eJ ) of the map eJ : M → eN
is contained in the subspace eNw∗ of continuously translating elements of eN of the representation
Q → B(cid:0)eN(cid:1), t 7→ eSt. Now, it is easy to obtain (1.1) by letting N = eNw∗ and

Ran E′ =nx ∈ eN : T (x) = x for any T ∈ S o.
eNw∗ =nx ∈ eN : T (x) = x for any T ∈ S o.

for all t ∈ Q.

Ut = E′eSt|eNw∗

where we consider E′ as an operator from N on eNw∗. Finally, we let J : M → eNw∗ the canonical
∗-monomorphism and E : eNw∗ → M the associated conditional expectation. We conclude that

Tt = EUtJ,

t > 0.

Remark 3.8 We refer to [AHW], [AnH], [CL] and [Oza] for QWEP von Neumann algebras.
We say that T is QWEP-dilatable if the deﬁnition 1.2 is satisﬁed such that N has QWEP.
Similarly, we say [Arh2, Deﬁnition 1.3] that (Tt)t>0 is QWEP-dilatable if the deﬁnition 1.3 is
satisﬁed with N having QWEP. It is easy to see that if each Tt is QWEP-dilatable then the

semigroup (Tt)t>0 is QWEP-dilatable. Indeed, in the proof, note that if each N 1

4 Dilations of semigroups on noncommutative Lp-spaces

The goal is to prove Theorem 4.4 below which is a noncommutative Lp analog of Theorem 3.7.
Suppose 1 < p < ∞. Recall the deﬁnition of [JLM, page 239] which says that a contraction
T : Lp(M ) → Lp(M ) on a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M ) is dilatable if there exist a non-
commutative Lp-space Lp(N ), two contractions J : Lp(M ) → Lp(N ) and P : Lp(N ) → Lp(M )
and an isometry U : Lp(N ) → Lp(N ) such that T n = P U nJ for any n > 0. Now, we introduce
a variant.

Deﬁnition 4.1 Suppose 1 6 p < ∞. We say that a completely positive contraction T : Lp(M ) →
Lp(M ) on a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M ) is completely positively dilatable if there exist a
noncommutative Lp-space Lp(N ), two completely positive contractions J : Lp(M ) → Lp(N ) and
P : Lp(N ) → Lp(M ) and a completely positive invertible isometry U : Lp(N ) → Lp(N ) such that

T n = P U nJ,

n > 0.

Remark 4.2 Note that a dilatable φ-Markov T : M → M on a von Neumann algebra M
equipped with a state φ induces a completely positively dilatable completely positive contraction
on the associated noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M ).

In this section, we use Banach ultraproducts. The same method that the beginning of the
proof of Theorem 3.7 with the stability of the class of noncommutative Lp-spaces under Banach
ultraproducts [Ray1] gives the following result.

Lemma 4.3 Suppose that (Tt)t>0 is a (not necessarily strongly continuous) semigroup of con-
tractions on Lp(M ) such that each operator Tt is completely positively dilatable. Then there ex-

ists a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(eN ), a group (Ut)t∈Q of completely positive invertible isome-
tries of Lp(eN ) and two completely positive contractions eJ : Lp(M ) → Lp(eN ) and eP : Lp(eN ) →
Tt = ePeUteJ,
Moreover, if M has QWEP, then eN has QWEP.
construction yields a too big space Lp(eN ) such that one can expect the representationeU : t 7→ eUt
of Q to be continuous on Lp(eN ). However, it is sitll possible to restrict t 7→ eUt to a smaller

subspace on which the desired continuity holds. Again, the method of [Fen1] does not apply to
our context.

One more time, if the semigroup (Tt)t>0 is strongly continuous, the above ultraproduct

t ∈ Q+.

Theorem 4.4 Suppose 1 < p < ∞. Let (Tt)t>0 be a strongly continuous semigroup of com-

Lp(M ) is completely positively dilatable. Then there exists a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(N ),
a strongly continuous group of completely positive isometries Ut : Lp(N ) → Lp(N ) and two
completely positive contractions J : Lp(M ) → Lp(N ) and P : Lp(N ) → Lp(M ) such that

of continuously translating elements. Furthermore, it follows from the result mentioned after
2.1 that Qc satisfy

: By Lemma 4.3, we obtain a representation eU : Q → B(Lp(eN )) by completely positive
Since the space Lp(eN ) and its dual Lp∗
(eN ) are uniformly convex (hence strictly convex), by
Theorem 2.1, we deduce that the kernel K(eU ) of S c(eU ) contains a unique element Qc and that
Qc : Lp(eN ) → Lp(eN ) is the projection from the Banach space Lp(eN ) onto the subspace Lp(eN )c
Thus the range Lp(eN )c of the projection Qc is invariant under the operator eUt for any t ∈ Q.
Moreover, we infer from Lemma 3.5 that the range Ran(eJ ) of the map eJ given by Lemma
4.3 is contained in the subspace Lp(eN )c of continuously translating elements of Lp(eN ) of the
representation eU . Furthermore, since each operator eUt is isometric and completely positive,
hence contractive, we see that the convex semigroup S c(eU ) of eU over the identity consists of
positive and consequently that the subspace Lp(eN )c is 1-completely positively complemented
in Lp(eN ), hence a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(N ) by the main result of [ArR]. Now, we

. We conclude

that

Tt = P UtJ,

t > 0.

(4.3)

It follows from the complete positivity of the projection Qc and from (4.2) that the induced
isometry Ut : Lp(N ) → Lp(N ) is also completely positive.

Remark 4.5 Note that there exists some completely positive contractive map T : Sp → Sp
which does not admit an isometric dilation on a noncommutative Lp-space, see [JLM]. See also
[Arh1] and [ALM] for more information on dilations on noncommutative Lp-spaces.

5 Examples

As we said in the introduction, Haagerup and Musat [HaM, Theorem 4.4] have characterised
dilatable Markov maps. Indeed, they proved that if T : M → M is a φ-Markov map on a von

12

Neumann algebra M equipped with a state φ then T is dilatable if and only if T is factorizable
in the sense of [AnD]. This result allows us to give concrete examples of dilatable semigroups.
Suppose that G is a discrete group. We denote by eG the neutral element of G. We denote
by λg : ℓ2
G the unitary operator of left translation by g and VN(G) the von Neumann
algebra of G spanned by the λg’s where g ∈ G. It is an ﬁnite algebra with its canonical faithful
normal ﬁnite trace given by

G → ℓ2

τG(x) =(cid:10)εeG , x(εeG )(cid:11)ℓ2

G

where (εg)g∈G is the canonical basis of ℓ2
G and x ∈ VN(G). A Fourier multiplier is a normal
linear map T : VN(G) → VN(G) such that there exists a complex function t : G → C such

that T(cid:0)(λ(g)(cid:1) = tgλ(g) for any g ∈ G. In this case, we denote T by Mt : VN(G) → VN(G).

It is well-known that a Fourier multiplier Mt : VN(G) → VN(G) is completely positive if and
only if the function t is positive deﬁnite. It is easy to see that a τG-Markov Fourier multiplier
Mt : VN(G) → VN(G) is selfadjoint if and only if t : G → C is a real function.

Using the factorisability of selfadjoint τG-Markov Fourier multipliers of [Ric], we deduce the

following result:

Corollary 5.1 Let G be a discrete group. Let (Tt)t>0 be a w*-semigroup of selfadjoint τG-
Markov Fourier multipliers on the von Neumann algebra VN(G). Then the semigroup (Tt)t>0
is dilatable.

6 Applications

We start with a little background on sectoriality and H ∞ functional calculus. We refer to
[Haa], [KW], [JMX] and [Arh2] for details and complements. Let X be a Banach space. A
closed densely deﬁned linear operator A : D(A) ⊂ X → X is called sectorial of type ω if its
spectrum σ(A) is included in the closed sector Σω, and for any angle ω < θ < π, there is a
positive constant Kθ such that

generators of bounded analytic semigroups.

For any 0 < θ < π, let H ∞(Σθ) be the algebra of all bounded analytic functions f : Σθ → C,
0 (Σθ) ⊂
H ∞(Σθ) be the subalgebra of bounded analytic functions f : Σθ → C for which there exist

equipped with the supremum norm kf kH∞(Σθ ) = sup(cid:8)|f (z)|
s, c > 0 such that |f (z)| 6 c|z|s(cid:0)1 + |z|)−2s for any z ∈ Σθ. Given a sectorial operator A of type

0 < ω < π, a bigger angle ω < θ < π, and a function f ∈ H ∞
0 (Σθ), one may deﬁne a bounded
operator f (A) by means of a Cauchy integral (see e.g. [Haa, Section 2.3] or [KW, Section 9]);
the resulting mapping H ∞
0 (Σθ) → B(X) taking f to f (A) is an algebra homomorphism. By
deﬁnition, A has a bounded H ∞(Σθ) functional calculus provided that this homomorphism is
6 Ckf kH∞(Σθ ) for
0 (Σθ). In the case when A has a dense range, the latter boundedness condition

Since a noncommutative Lp-space is UMD [PiX, Corollary 7.7], using [KW, Corollary 10.9]

and Theorem 4.4 we obtain:

Theorem 6.1 let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful state φ. Let
(Tt)t>0 be a w∗-semigroup of factorizable φ-Markov maps on M . We let −Ap be the generator
of the induced strongly continuous semigroup (Tt)t>0 on the Banach space Lp(M ). Then for
some 0 < θ < π, the operator Ap has a bounded H ∞(Σθ) functional calculus.

This result give a partial answer to the question of [JMX, page 57]. By example, this result
is usable with a w∗-semigroup (Tt)t>0 of selfadjoint τG-Markov Fourier multipliers on the von
Neumann algebra VN(G) of a discrete group G.
