MODELING AND RELATED RESULTS FOR CURRENT-ACTUATED
PIEZOELECTRIC BEAMS BY INCLUDING MAGNETIC EFFECTS∗

KIRSTEN A. MORRIS † AND AHMET ¨OZKAN ¨OZER ‡

Abstract. Piezo-electric material can be controlled with current as the electrical variable,
instead of voltage. The main purpose of this paper is to derive the governing equations for a current-
controlled piezo-electric beam and to investigate stabilizability. Besides the consideration of current
control, there are several new aspects to the model here. Most signiﬁcantly, magnetic eﬀects are
included. For the electromagnetic part of the model, electrical potential and magnetic vector potential
are chosen to be quadratic-through thickness to include the induced eﬀects of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Two sets of decoupled system of partial diﬀerential equations are obtained; one for stretching
motion and another one for bending motion. Hamilton’s principle is used to derive a boundary value
problem that models a single piezo-electric beam actuated by a charge (or current) source at the
electrodes. Current or charge controllers at the electrodes can only control the stretching motion.
Attention is therefore focused on control of the stretching equations in this paper. It is shown that the
Lagrangian of the beam is invariant under certain transformations. A Coulomb-type gauge condition
which is widely used in the electromagnetic theory is used here. This gauge condition decouples the
electrical potential equation from the equations of the magnetic potential. A semigroup approach
is used to prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed. Unlike the voltage or charge actuation, a
bounded control operator in the natural energy space is obtained in the current actuation case. The
paper concludes with analysis of stabilizability and comparison with other actuation approaches and
models.

1. Introduction. Piezoelectric materials are elastic beam/plates covered by
electrodes at the top and bottom surfaces, insulated at the edges (to prevent fringing
eﬀects), and connected to an external electric circuit. (See Figure 1.1.) They convert
mechanical energy to electrical and magnetic energy, and vice versa. These materials
are widely used in civil, aeronautic and space structures due to their small size and
high power density. These materials can be actuated by either external mechani-
cal forces or electrical forces. There are mainly three ways to (electrically) actuate
piezoelectric materials: voltage, current or charge. Piezoelectric materials have been
traditionally activated by a voltage source [3, 4, 9, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32].
It is well-
known that the control operator is unbounded in the energy space if the piezoelectric
structure is controlled by a voltage or a charge source, for instance see [2, 9, 16, 21, 28].
Hysteresis occurs in the voltage-strain relationship for piezo-electric structures;
see for instance, [28]. This complicates control of these materials. One way to avoid
hysteresis is by applying only low voltages, but this prevents these structures from
being used at their maximum potential. Therefore controller design needs to consider
hysteresis in order to obtain maximum accuracy and eﬀectiveness. Some approaches
are passivity [14] and inverse compensation [29]. Another way to reduce the hys-
teresis is current or charge actuation, see for instance [6, 12, 15, 19, 20, 23]. Exist-
ing models for current control use only circuit equations attached to the standard
elastic beam equations, and magnetic eﬀects are not considered. Magnetic eﬀects,
even though small, were previously shown to be very important to the controllability

and stabilizability of piezoelectric beams [33]. In fact, it has been shown [21] that
voltage-controlled beams cannot even be asymptotically stabilized for certain material
parameters.

Fig. 1.1: When either charge σs(t) or current is(x, t) is prescribed to the electrodes, an electric ﬁeld
is created between the electrodes, and therefore the beam/plate either shrinks or extends. Unlike
the voltage actuation, the input-output hysteresis reduces substantially.

In this paper, dynamic magnetic eﬀects are included in the derivation of a model
for piezoelectric beams actuated by a current (or charge) source. The electromagnetic
ﬁeld is described in terms of scalar electric potential and magnetic vector potential,
After deriving expressions the various contributions to the energy, Hamilton’s Princi-
ple is used to derive a system of partial diﬀerential equations modelling the coupling
between the mechanical and the electro-magnetic dynamics. These equations do not
have a unique solution since the potentials are not uniquely determined. This is be-
cause the Lagrangian corresponding to Maxwell’s equations is invariant under certain
transformations; for instance see [8, page 80]). Obtaining a system of equations with
a unique solution requires a appropriate gauge condition. A number of gauges are
possible. A Coulomb type of transformation is used here.
Implementation of this
transformation simpliﬁes the equations considerably. The original highly coupled sys-
tem of equations becomes a system of equations where the equations corresponding
to the electrical variables are completely decoupled from the ones involving magnetic
potential variables. Well-posedness of the model in an appropriate Hilbert space is
then established. The norm in the Hilbert space corresponds to the energy of the
system. It is shown that the spectrum of the generator consists entirely of imaginary
eigenvalues. Stabilizability of the model is compared to voltage control, as well as
to the case where magnetic eﬀects are neglected. Some of the results presented in
this paper, in particular, Lemma 2.1, Theorem 3.1, Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and a weaker
version of Theorem 5.1 were previously reported in the conference paper [22].

2. Physical Model. Let x1, x2 be the longitudinal directions, and x3 be the
transverse directions (see Figure 1.1). Assume that the piezoelectric beam occupy
the region Ω = [0, L] × [−r, r] × [− h
2 ] with the boundary ∂Ω, the electroded re-
gion and the insulated region, where L >> h. Throughout this paper, dots denote
diﬀerentiation with respect to time, that is ˙x(t) = dx

Let K, P, E and B be kinetic, potential, electrical, and magnetic energies of the
beam, respectively, and let W be the work done by the external forces. To model
charge or current-actuated piezoelectric beams we use the following Lagrangian [18]

L =

[K − (P − E + B) + W] dt

(2.6)

for which we use the constitutive equations (2.5) where the pair (S, E) belongs to the
set of independent variables. In the above, P − E + B is called electrical enthalpy.
Note that in modeling piezoelectric beams by voltage-actuated electrodes we use a
diﬀerent Lagrangian

˜L =

[K − (P + E) + B + W] dt

(2.7)

for which the constitutive equations (2.5) are written in terms of the independent
variables (S, D). The Lagrangian ˜L can be obtained by applying a Legendre transfor-
mation to L. Here P + E denotes the total stored energy of the beam, and B acts as
the electrical kinetic energy of the beam. This case is studied in [21]. Depending on
the prescribed quantity at the electrodes, Lagrangian is chosen either L or ˜L.

and appropriate mechanical boundary conditions at the edges of the beam (the beam
is clamped, hinged, free, etc.). Here B denotes the magnetic ﬁeld vector, and σb, ib, σs,
is, V, µ, n denote body charge density, body current density, surface charge density,
surface current density, voltage, magnetic permeability, and unit normal vector to the
surface ∂Ω, respectively. In this paper we consider only current and charge-driven
electrodes (i.e. we ignore(2.11)). The voltage-driven electrode case is handled in
details in [21]. In modeling piezoelectric beams, there are mainly three approaches
including electric and magnetic eﬀects [31]:

i) Electrostatic electric ﬁeld: Electrostatic electric ﬁeld approach is the most widely-

used approach in the literature. It completely ignores magnetic eﬀects: B =
˙D = ib = σb = 0. Maxwell’s equations (2.8) reduce to ∇·D = 0 and ∇×E = 0.
Therefore, there exist a scalar electric potential such that E = −∇φ and φ is
determined up to a constant.

ii) Quasi-static electric ﬁeld: This approach rules out some of the magnetic eﬀects
˙D and B are non-

(non-magnetizable materials) [31]: σb = ib = 0. However,
zero. Therefore, (2.8) reduce to
∇ · D = 0, ∇ · B = 0,

˙B = −∇ × E,

˙D =

(∇ × B).

1
µ

The equation ∇·B = 0 implies that there exists a vector A such that B = ∇×
A. This vector is called the magnetic potential . It follows from substituting
B to ˙B = −∇ × E that there exists a scalar electric potential φ such that

E = − ˙A − ∇φ.

(2.12)
where ˙A stands for the induced electric ﬁeld due to the time-varying magnetic
eﬀects. One simpliﬁcation in this approach is to ignore A and ˙A since A, ˙A (cid:28)
φ. With this assumption ˙D may be non-zero.

iii) Fully dynamic electric ﬁeld: Unlike the quasi-static assumption, A and ˙A
are left in the model. Depending on the type of material, body charge density
σb and body current density ib can also be non-zero. Note that even though
the displacement current ˙D is assumed to be non-zero in both quasi-static
and fully dynamic approaches, the term ¨D is zero in quasi-static approach
since ˙A = 0.

Since the piezoelectric materials are not perfectly insulated, the electric ﬁeld E causes
currents to ﬂow when conductivity occurs. Therefore the time-dependent equation of
the continuity of electric charge must be employed. In this paper, we follow the fully
dynamic approach to include all of the magnetic eﬀects. If we take the divergence of
both sides of Amp´ere-Maxwell equation (2.8), we obtain
∇ · (∇ × B) = ∇ · ib + ∇ ·

The term on the left hand side of the equation above is zero, and therefore by using
Gauss’s law (2.8), we obtain the following electric continuity condition

Henceforth, to simplify the notation, x = x1 and z = x3.
Note that piezoelectricity is the direct result of piezoelectric eﬀect, which is, once
the external electric ﬁeld is applied to the electrodes, strain is produced and therefore
the beam/plate extends or shrinks (direct eﬀect), whereas, when the plate/beam
extends and shrink, it produces electric voltage which is so-called the induced (inverse)
eﬀect. The linear through-thickness assumption of the electric potential φ(x, z) =
φ0(x) + zφ1(x) completely ignores the induced potential eﬀect since φ is completely
known as a function of voltage. For example, when the voltage is prescribed at the

(cid:1) = V and φ(cid:0)− h

(cid:1) = 0, we have

electrodes, i.e. φ(cid:0) h

,

and therefore the electric ﬁeld component in the transverse direction E3 becomes
uniform in the transverse direction, i.e. E3 = −φ1 = − V
h , as we consider electrostatic
and quasi-static assumptions. Therefore the induced eﬀect is ignored in the linear-
through thickness assumption. In this paper, we use a quadratic-through thickness
potential distribution that takes care of the induced eﬀect and improves the modeling
accuracy:

φ(x, z) = φ0(x) + zφ1(x) +

z2

φ2(x).

(2.16)

Since we are in the beam theory, we assume that the magnetic vector potential
A has nonzero components only in x and z directions. To keep the consistency with
φ, we assume that A is quadratic through-thickness as well:

one nonzero component since is ⊥ B, and is ⊥ n by (2.10). Moreover, ib has only one
nonzero component since we assumed that there is no force acting in the x2 and x3
directions.

If the magnetic eﬀects are neglected, a variational approach cannot be used in
the case of current actuation since A ≡ 0 and so W ≡ 0. This is very diﬀerent from
the charge and voltage actuation cases since for charge and voltage actuation W is
not a function of A.

Note that the stretching (3.4) and bending (3.2) equations are completely decoupled
when only one type of external electrical force is present. It will be assumed, as is
common in practice, that there is no free body charge or current, i.e. σb ≡ ib ≡ 0.
Then the bending equations (3.2) are entirely uncontrolled and also decoupled from
the stretching equations (3.4). Therefore, from this point on, only the stretching

(3.6)

The magnetic potential vector A and the electric potential φ are not uniquely
deﬁned by (2.8). In fact, the Lagrangian L (2.6) is invariant under a large class of
transformations.

Theorem 3.1. For any scalar C 1 function χ = χ(x, z, t), the Lagrangian L is

invariant under the transformation

A (cid:55)→ ˜A := A + ∇χ
φ (cid:55)→ ˜φ := φ − ˙χ.

(3.7)

Proof: By (3.7), ˜A and ˜φ satisfy

˜B = ∇ × ˜A = ∇ × A + ∇ × ∇χ = ∇ × A = B

˜E = − ˙˜A − ∇ ˜φ = − ˙A − ∇ ˙χ − ∇φ + ∇ ˙χ = − ˙A − ∇φ = E.

This implies that E− P and B deﬁned respectively by (2.19) and (2.20) are invariant
under the transformation. Since K in (2.21) is independent of A and φ, we need to
check if W deﬁned by (2.22) is invariant under (3.7). We choose the arbitrary scalar
function χ to be quadratic-through thickness χ = χ0 + zχ1 + z2
2 χ2 to be consistent
with the choices of ϕ and A in (2.16) and (2.17), respectively. We also assume that χ

satisﬁes the stationary conditions(cid:12)(cid:12)χ0 = χ1 = χ2(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0,T = 0 for compatibility. By (3.7)

L is invariant under the transformation (3.7). (cid:3)

b = 0 at the insulated edges of electrodes. Hence, the Lagrangian

Since L is invariant under transformations of type (3.7), the electric and magnetic
potentials are not uniquely determined by (3.4) and (3.5). An additional condition
can be added to remove the ambiguity. The additional condition is generally known
as a gauge and it is generally chosen to simplify the equations. It is often convenient
to choose the gauge to decouple the electrical potential equation from the equations
of the magnetic potential. The Coulomb gauge in standard electromagnetic theory is
deﬁned by

DivA = 0

in Ω, A · n = 0

on ∂Ω.

This is one of the gauges commonly used in electromagnetic theory. With this addi-
tional condition, the Maxwell equations (2.8) written in terms of the potentials

are decoupled (for instance see [8, page 80]) and (3.8) becomes

−∇2φ = 0.

Here it was assumed that A and φ are quadratic in the thickness variable z. So in
(2.19)-(2.22) integration by parts is with respect to the x variable, but not z. Thus,
(3.4) is not identical to (3.8). Examining equation (3.4 b) the appropriate condition
to decouple the magnetic and electric equations is

The gauge condition uniquely determines φ and A. Let A, ˜A be potentials that
satisfy (3.9) and (3.10), and also are related by a transformation of the form (3.7).
Then the arbitrary scalar function χ has to satisfy the following diﬀerential equation

where we used (3.10). Since (3.12) with this boundary condition has only the trivial
solution χ1 ≡ 0 it follows that the additional conditions (3.9,3.10) uniquely deﬁne
the potentials φ and A in (3.7). The existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the
system (3.4) with (3.9,3.10) will be analyzed in details in Section 4.

Note that other components of χ are coupled through the bending equation (3.2).
Showing that these components are equal to zero requires to choice of another gauge
condition similar to (3.9). Since bending equations are not considered in this paper,
this point is not considered.

a unique solution. The solution deﬁnes a strongly continuous semigroup on a Hilbert
space with norm corresponding to the physical energy. Moreover this semigroup is
unitary, that is, the energy is conserved with time.

It is well-known that Pξ is a compact operator on L2(0, L). Also, Pξ is a non-negative
operator. To see this, let Pξu = w. Then w − ξwxx = u with wx(0) = wx(L) = 0, and
L2(0,L) ≥ 0. (4.4)

(cid:104)Pξu, u(cid:105)L2(0,L) = (cid:104)w, w − ξwxx(cid:105)L2(0,L) = (cid:107)w(cid:107)2

Theorem 4.1. The form (4.12) deﬁnes an inner product on the linear space H.

Moreover, E is the norm induced by this inner product and H is complete.

Proof: It is straightforward to verify that (4.12) deﬁnes a sesquilinear form. The
main problem is to show that this bilinear form (4.12) is coercive. This follows since
Pξ is a self-adjoint positive operator on L2(0, L). Using the gauge condition (3.13),

Therefore, (4.12) is a valid inner product on H and so deﬁnes a norm. It is straight-
forward to verify that E(t) as deﬁned in (4.10) is the norm induced by (4.12).

It can also easily be shown that H with this norm is complete. This follows from

the fact that the gauge constraints in H are satisﬁed weakly, i.e.

0 = (cid:104)ξy2, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y3, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)
0 = (cid:104)ξy5, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y6, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)

for every φ ∈ H 1(0, L). Therefore a Cauchy sequence {Yn} in H converges to Y ∈ H.

Lemma 4.1. The operator A is densely deﬁned in H.
Proof: Let yn ∈ Dom(A) → y ∈ H. Then

(cid:107)y1n − y1(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y2n − y2(cid:107)H 1
0 (0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y3n − y3(cid:107)H 1(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y4n − y4(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y5n − y5(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y6n − y6(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0.

For every z ∈ (C∞
0 [0, L]. This also shows that
the trace for y2 is well deﬁned. For this we need the Green’s formula as the following
For y2n ∈ H 1

0 [0, L])(cid:48), we have (cid:104)yn, z(cid:105) → (cid:104)y, z(cid:105) in C∞

and therefore y2|x=0,L = 0. We check whether y satisﬁes the gauge conditions.

0 = (cid:104)−ξ(y2n)x + y3n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L) = (cid:104)ξy2n, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y3n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)
→ (cid:104)ξy2, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y3, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)
= (cid:104)−ξ(y2)x + y3, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L) ,

and,

0 = (cid:104)−ξ(y5n)x + y6n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L) → (cid:104)ξy5, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y6, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)
= (cid:104)ξy5, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y6, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)

It follows then from the Lumer-Phillips Theorem, that A generates a dissipative
semigroup on H. Since A is skew-adjoint, the semigroup is unitary, that is in the
absence of control

(cid:107)y(t)(cid:107) = (cid:107)y(0)(cid:107).(cid:3)

The fact that A generates a unitary semigroup means that the norm and hence
the energy E(t) is conserved along solution trajectories of (4.14) if there is no control
term.

0 (0, L) and H 1(0, L) are compactly

{Yn}, such that

(cid:107)y1n − y1(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y2n − y2(cid:107)H 1(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y3n − y3(cid:107)H 1(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y4n − y4(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y5n − y5(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0
(cid:107)y6n − y6(cid:107)L2(0,L) → 0.

Therefore for φ ∈ H 1(0, L)

0 = (cid:104)−ξ(y2n)x + y3n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L) = (cid:104)ξy2n, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y3n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)

0 = (cid:104)−ξ(y5n)x + y6n, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L) → (cid:104)ξy5, φx(cid:105)L2(0,L) + (cid:104)y6, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)

= (cid:104)−ξ(y5)x + y6, φ(cid:105)L2(0,L)

where we used (4.25). This proves the compactness. Moreover, 0 ∈ ρ(A) by Theorem
4.2, it follows that (λI − A)−1 is compact at λ = 0, and thus compact for all λ ∈ ρ(A).
Hence the spectrum of A has all isolated eigenvalues. (cid:3)

5. Conclusions. In this paper a model for current actuation of a piezo-electric
beam was derived in detail with fully dynamic electro-magnetic eﬀects using Hamil-
ton’s Principle. An Euler-Bernoulli model was used for the mechanical model. If the
Mindlin-Timoshenko small displacement assumptions are used instead, the bending
equations (3.2) change substantially. However, stretching equations in (3.4) remain
the same. Since the control only aﬀects the stretching equations, the choice of beam
model does not aﬀect stabilizability.
With dynamic magnetic eﬀects, the adjoint B∗ feedback in both the voltage-
for electrostatic models this feedback is

and current-controlled cases is electrical:
mechanical.

In the case of voltage actuation of a piezoelectric beam model the control enters
as a distribution. Letting δ indicate the Dirac delta function, c a physical parameter,
the control operator is[21]

B = c

03×1

δ(x − L) − δ(x)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

As when magnetic eﬀects are neglected, the control operator B is not bounded on
the state space H = (H 1(0, L))2 × (L2(0, L))2. However, when magnetic eﬀects are
included, the voltage-actuated piezo-electric beam is only exactly observable and ex-
ponentially stabilizable when the material parameters satisfy number-theoretical con-
ditions. The system is asymptotically stabilizable under a wider set of parameter
values [21]. Explicit polynomial estimates for certain combination of parameters have
been obtained [24].

Unlike voltage control, for current actuation with magnetic eﬀects, the control
operator is bounded and rank 1. Thus, it is compact and it is not possible to expo-
nentially stabilize the piezoelectric beam; see [13] or the textbook [7]. Only asymptotic
stabilization is possible.

if the corresponding eigenfunctions φ satisfy (cid:82) L

Theorem 5.1. A given eigenvalue of A is asymptotically stabilizable if and only
0 φ5dx (cid:54)= 0. Proof: Let λ be an

eigenvalue of ˜A with eigenfunction ψ, (cid:107)ψ(cid:107) = 1 :

If B∗ψ = 0 then ψ is an eigenfunction of A and so B∗ψ (cid:54)= 0. Then

λψ = Aψ − k1BB∗ψ.

implies that the semigroup is asymptotically stable. Conversely, if (cid:82) L

Thus, since the spectrum consists only of imaginary eigenvalues (Theorem 4.4), and
there are no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, Arendt-Batty’s stability theorem [1]
0 φ5dx = 0 for
some eigenfunction, the corresponding eigenvalue remains on the imaginary axis and
the system is not asymptotically stable. (cid:3)

With the state space H, based on energy, used in this paper, 0 is an eigenvalue

of A with an inﬁnite-dimensional eigenspace
E = {y ∈ H; y4 = y5 = y6 = 0, y3 ∈ H 2(0, L), y3x(0) = y3x(L) = 0, y2 = y3x} ⊂ D(A).
Since y5 = 0 for all y ∈ E, the 0 eigenvalue is not stabilizable. This is typical for
a structure with a rigid body mode; a voltage-controlled piezo-electric beam with
natural boundary conditions, such as used here, also has an unstabilizable eigenvalue
at 0. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the rest of the system is
asymptotically stabilizable.

Stabilizability is quite diﬀerent for electro-static models. For the voltage-controlled
system, an elliptic-type diﬀerential equation is obtained for charge, and once this equa-
tion is solved and back substituted to the mechanical equations, the system reduces
to a simple wave equation with the voltage control V (t) acting at the free end of the
beam. This model is well-known to be exponentially stabilizable with B∗ feedback,
i.e. see [5, 26]. Hamilton’s principle cannot be used to derive a current-controlled sys-
tem with electrostatic or quasi-static assumptions. Such a model can be obtained by
adding a circuit equation for the capacitance ˙V = 1
i to the voltage controlled model.
Cp
The control operator is bounded, so the system is not exponentially stabilizable. The
B∗ feedback involves voltage. The same analysis used for the voltage-controlled case
in [21] can be used to show that the system is asymptotically stabilizable for certain
parameter values.
Charge actuation is mathematically very similar to voltage actuation for both
electrostatic and quasi-static assumptions. This is because θ, η, ˙θ, ˙η,(cid:28) φ1. Without
the terms θ, η, ˙θ, ˙η in (4.8)-(4.9), the model (4.8)-(4.9) for the clamped-free case be-

trostatic model, B∗ feedback control σs(t) = −kB∗y = −k ˙v(L, t) where k > 0, leads
to an exponentially stable system; details can be found in [25]. The case of charge
actuation with magnetic eﬀects yields a model very similar to voltage control with
magnetic eﬀects and the system can be shown to be stabilizable for certain parameter
values.

Thus, for all of voltage-, current and charge- control, magnetic eﬀects have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on stabilizability. Although the magnetic coupling µ is very small,
stabilizability of piezo-electric beams is qualitatively diﬀerent for models with dynamic
magnetics than for an electrostatic models.
