When charge current passes through a normal metal that exhibits spin Hall eﬀect, spin accumu-
lates at the edge of the sample in the transverse direction. We predict that this spin accumulation,
or spin voltage, enables quantum tunneling of spin through an insulator or vacuum to reach a fer-
romagnet, which causes a spin-transfer torque on the ferromagnet that in general does not decay
monotonically with the thickness of the insulator or vacuum. Combining with the spin Hall mag-
netoresistance, this tunneling mechanism points to a new type of tunneling spectroscopy that can
probe the magnon density of states of an insulator in a noninvasive manner.

Introduction.- A major issue in the ﬁeld of spintronic
research concerns the electrical control of magnetization
dynamics. A particularly feasible scheme is to utilize
the spin Hall eﬀect (SHE)[1–3] in a normal metal (NM),
where an applied charge current causes a spin accumu-
lation, or spin voltage, at the transverse edge of the
sample[4–6]. When the edge is in conjunction with a
ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) such as Y3Fe5O12 (YIG)
[7], or thin ﬁlm ferromagnetic metal (FMM) such as Co
[8–12], the spin voltage induces a spin-transfer torque
(STT) [13, 14] on the magnetization, rendering an ef-
ﬁcient mechanism for magnetization switching.
In the
reciprocal process known as spin pumping[15, 16], a mag-
netization dynamics induced by, for instance, ferromag-
netic resonance (FMR), injects a pure spin current into
the NM[17–19].

The microscopic origin of these fascinating phenomena
has been linked to the quantum tunneling of spin with-
out transferring charge[20], which states that the spin
voltage causes an injection of spin-polarized electrons to-
wards the FMI or FMM thin ﬁlm. The electrons are
totally reﬂected back but have ﬁnite probability of ﬂip-
ping their spin after reﬂection, hence transfer angular
momentum into the FMI or FMM. In this Letter, we
further predict that even if the FMI or FMM is not in
direct contact with the NM, but separated by an insulat-
ing oxide layer or vacuum, the spin-polarized electron can
still tunnel through the separation to cause angular mo-
mentum transfer. Such a tunneling process serves as the
spintronic analog of ﬁeld electron emission, and is purely
a quantum eﬀect that may be overlooked by diﬀusive ap-
proaches. We reveal the unconventional behavior of this
tunneling process, and propose a type of tunneling spec-
troscopy that targets the spin excitation of an insulator
based on this event.

Quantum tunneling of spin through an insulator or
vacuum.- To demonstrate the spin voltage induced quan-
tum tunneling through a separation layer, we adopt the
formalism developed in the minimal model in Ref. 20.
Consider the NM/vacuum/FMI trilayer shown in Fig. 1

(a) that contains three regions: (1) An NM at −∞ < x <
0 described semiclassically by HN = p2/2m − µσ
x, where
µσ
x = ±|µx|/2 is the spin voltage of spin σ = {↑,↓} at
position x caused by SHE[4–6]. For an up spin incident
from the left, the wave function at x < 0 is

1 (cid:19) , (1)

0 (cid:19) + Ce−ik0↓x(cid:18) 0

ψN = (cid:0)Aeik0↑x + Be−ik0↑x(cid:1)(cid:18) 1
where k0σ = p2m (ǫ + µσ
0 )/, and ǫ is the Fermi energy
that serves as energy unit. We consider a charge current
jc
y ˆy, so electrons moving in ˆx direction has σ k ˆz because
of the SHE relation k0σ ˆx k σ × ˆy, and gives a positive
spin voltage µ0 k ˆz at the interface such that k0↑ > k0↓.
(2) Vacuum or nonmagnetic oxide in the region 0 < x < d
described by HO = p2/2m + V1 with V1 − ǫ > 0 the work
function or insulating gap, whose wave function is
ψO = (cid:0)De−λx + Eeλx(cid:1)(cid:18) 1
1 (cid:19) ,(2)
where λ = p2m(V1 − ǫ)/. (3) The FMI occupying x >
d described by HF I = p2/2m + V0 + ΓS · σ, where V0 >
ǫ is the potential step. The S · σ term describes the
s−d hybridization of the conduction electron spin and the
magnetization S = S(sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ). The
evanescent wave function in the FMI is

where q± = p2m (V0 ± ΓS − ǫ)/ > 0.
The amplitudes A ∼ E are determined by match-
ing the wave function and its derivative at x = 0
and x = d,
leaving only one free variable that is at-
tributed to the Fermi surface-averaged spin density at
the interface |A|2 = NF|µ0|/a3, where NF is the den-
sity of states (DOS) per a3 at the Fermi surface, and
a = 2π/kF = h/√2mǫ is the Fermi wave length that

serves as unit length.
It is convenient[13] to introduce
the frame (x2, y2, z2) deﬁned in Fig. 1 (a), where ˆz2 k S,
ˆy2 = ˆµ0 × ˆS/ sin θ, and ˆx2 = −ˆS×(cid:16) ˆµ0 × ˆS(cid:17) / sin θ. The

spinors in Eq. (3) are simply (1 0)T and (0 1)T in this
frame. The conduction electron spin tunneled into the
FMI is hσi = hψF I|σ|ψF Ii, whose components are

The total spin per unit area a2 is denoted by hσi =

about 2π/ (q+ + q−) ∼ a, is treated as a macrospin S.
From the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) dynamics, the s − d cou-
pling Hsd = Γσ · S renders the STT[13], whose response
in the damping-like and ﬁeld-like direction deﬁne the spin
mixing conductance[21] Gr and Gi, respectively,

after substituting Eq. (4) and |A|2 = NF|µ0|/a3. Alter-
natively, from angular momentum conservation a2(j0 −
j∞) = a2j0 = a2jd = τ where jx is the spin current
at position x, one obtains the same Gr,i[20]. The phe-
nomenon of spin pumping has also been demonstrated in
this set up[22], whose mechanism follows that discussed
in Ref. 20 and satisﬁes Onsager relation[21]. In both STT
and spin pumping, the spin relaxation in the FMI plays
a relatively minor role[20].

For most parameters, both Gr and Gi monotonically
decay with the separation thickness d, consistent with
the spin pumping experiment in Pt/oxide/YIG[22]. How-
ever, when the exchange coupling is comparable to the
insulating gap of the FMI, |ΓS| ≈ (V0 − ǫ)/ǫ, we found
that the damping-like component Gi displays a slight en-
hancement at small d (≈ 0.2a ≈ 0.08nm for Pt), as shown
by the orange line in Fig. 1 (b). Thus the interplay be-
tween the exchange coupling and the insulating gaps can
lead to unconventional tunneling behaviors in certain pa-
rameter ranges.

is thinner than its spin relaxation length. In this case,
since the insulating gap of the nonmagnetic substrate is
not crucial to spin transport[20], we set it to be inﬁnite
for simplicity, such that the wave function vanishes
inside the substrate.
Since the oxide separates NM
and FMM, we consider the situation that in the NM
a charge current ﬂows but not in the FMM, such that
the spin-orbit torque[23–30] does not arise, and the spin
torque comes entirely from the SHE in the NM. The
wave function in the NM and in the oxide are described
by Eqs. (1) and (2), with the interface positions deﬁned
in Fig. 2(a). The wave function in the FMM described

Figure 2 (b) shows Gr and Gi versus thickness of the
oxide or vacuum d. Remarkably, Gr in general does not
monotonically decrease with d but may show signiﬁcant
enhancement (up to more than 50%) at small d, and Gi
can change sign with increasing d. This very unconven-
tional tunneling behavior implies that, surprisingly, in-
serting an insulating oxide of atomic layer thickness may
enhance Gr and hence the eﬃciency of magnetization
switching in FMM thin ﬁlms[8–12]. Figure 2 (c) and (d)
show Gr and Gi as functions of FMM thickness b and
oxide thickness d, where this nonmonotonic dependence
on d can be seen in many regions of parameter space.
In addition, certain periodicity with respect to the FMM
thickness b is evident, a result expected from the quan-
tum interference eﬀect when the spin travels inside the
FMM[20]. In the supplementary material[36], we further
demonstrate that the presence of the vacuum or oxide
layer, despite being nonmagnetic, inﬂuences the quan-
tum interference pattern of Gr,i.

spectroscopy.- As ﬁeld electron emission is the ba-
sis of tunneling spectroscopy, below we introduce a
new type of tunneling spectroscopy based on the quan-
tum tunneling caused by spin voltage. Consider the
NM/vacuum/FMI in Fig. 1 (a). We aim at calculating
the diﬀerential conductance deﬁned from the spin
current and spin voltage. Under the approximation that
only the magnetization at the interface atomic layer
denoted by S0 experiences the STT since electrons only
penetrate the FMI over a very short distance, the STT is
equivalent to the torque caused by applying an eﬀective
magnetic ﬁeld on S0. Thus the FMI under the inﬂuence
of the STT is described by

HF M = H 0

F M + Hint = H 0

F M + Bef f · S0 ,

(11)

where H 0
F M describes the magnons. The eﬀective mag-
netic ﬁeld Bef f caused by STT points along the direction
of total spin hσi tunneled into the FMI, and thus

Bef f ∝ −Gr ˆS0 × µ0 − Giµ0 ,

(12)
since τ = dS0/dt = i [Bef f · S0, S0] gives the correct LL
dynamics described by Eq. (6) with S → S0 (hereafter
 = 1). Note that in Eqs. (11) and (12), the unit vector
ˆS0 = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ) denotes the direction
of the interface magnetization, while S0 = (Sx
0 ) is
the operator of interface magnetization expressed in the
(x, y, z) frame.

The Bef f , which contains both ﬁeld-like and damping-
like components, causes a torque that can be calcu-
lated within linear response theory[7, 37]. We are in-
terested in z component of the torque as it is related to
the longitudinal spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) [31–
34] as addressed below. Firstly, the spin accumulation
µ0 = ψ†
0ασαβψ0β is expressed in terms of electron op-
erators at the interface. After Fourier transform and a
gauge transformation[36], the z-component of the torque

where the eﬀective couplings J1 ∝ (Gr cos θ + iGi) and

the spin mixing conductance and the direction of ˆS. The
spin nonconserved M (t) originates from the damping-like

and then using analytical continuation iω → µ0 + iδ, and
similarly for U M (iω) using iω → 0 + iδ. Only the ﬁrst

where we have converted momentum sums into energy

identify the torque with the spin current in the NM at the

up electrons, spin down electrons, and magnons, respec-
tively, and nF and nB denote the Fermi and Bose distri-
bution function. At low temperature, the second deriva-
tive of the spin current is proportional to the magnon
DOS at −µ0[36]

where we have used the fact that jz
0 is proportional to
the SMR in the longitudinal direction ∆ρ1, and µ0 is
proportional to the input charge current jc [32]. Equation
(18) indicates a new type of tunneling spectroscopy that
can directly measure the magnon DOS of the FMI at a
speciﬁc energy, achieved by taking the second derivative
of the longitudinal SMR in the NM with respect to the
input charge current.

The analysis from Eq. (11) to (18) is also valid if the
oxide or vacuum is absent (d = 0 in Eqs.(4) to (6)), i.e.,
an NM/FMI bilayer in which SMR has been intensively
investigated[31–33], although the probe (NM) is perma-
nently attached to the sample (FMI) in this situation.
These SMR experiments typically operate at charge cur-
rent density no more than jc ∼ 108A/cm2 at room tem-
perature due to Joule heating [31, 33, 34]. Assuming a
typical NM thickness ∼ 10nm and a spin diﬀusion length
of the same order, and the conductivity σ ∼ 107S/m and
spin Hall angle θH ∼ 0.1 for Pt[3], the spin voltage pro-
duced at jc ∼ 108A/cm2 is µ0 ∼0.1meV, meaning that
only a very narrow energy range of magnon DOS will be
probed using a typical SMR set up. Thus in order to en-
large µ0 to broaden the probing energy range, a suﬃcient
cooling or using pulse electric current that can reduce the
Joule heating at higher input current jc ≫ 108A/cm2 is

expected. In principle, a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) based on this quantum tunneling of spin is also
possible by fabricating the NM into a nanometer size
tip, although measuring the SMR caused by tunneling
through such a small tip will obviously be very challeng-
ing.

Conclusions.- In summary, we predict that the spin
voltage caused by SHE can induce quantum tunneling of
spin through a thin insulator or vacuum, realizing the
spintronic analog of ﬁeld electron emission. This tunnel-
ing process yields a STT that in general does not mono-
tonically decay with thickness of the insulator or vac-
uum, as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Consequently, inserting
an ultrathin insulator may improve the performance of
magnetization switching by SHE. Combining with SMR
measurements, we propose that taking the second deriva-
tive of SMR with respect to the input charge current, as
described by Eq. (18), realizes a new type of tunneling
spectroscopy that has direct access to the magnon DOS
of an insulator.

Figure 3 shows the spin mixing conductance Gr and

assuming a constant work function or oxide gap (V1−ǫ)/ǫ.
When the vacuum or oxide is absent d = 0, we recover
the NM/FMM/substrate trilayer reported in Ref. 20 of
the main text, where Gr,i shows oscillatory behavior with
respect to both the FMM thickness and the s − d cou-
pling, which has been attributed to the quantum inter-
ference eﬀect when the spin travels inside the FMM. In
the presence of the vacuum or oxide layer d 6= 0, the
quantum interference eﬀect still manifests, but the in-
terference pattern changes signiﬁcantly with the vacuum

nonmagnetic, participates in and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences
the quantum interference eﬀect for the spin transport in
this multilayer system.

II. DETAIL OF LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY

AND DIFFERENTIAL CONDUCTANCE

In NM/vacuum/FMI, the STT is equivalent to the
torque produced by the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld described
by Eq. (12) in the main text. We may write the z-
component of the torque operator as

ˆτ z = ˜Gi [S0 × µ0]z + ˜Gr hS0 ×(cid:16)ˆS0 × µ0(cid:17)iz

(sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ). Within tunneling formal-
ism, the prefactors are proportional to the spin mixing
conductance ˜Gr,i ∝ Gr,i. Likewise, the eﬀective interact-
ing Hamiltonian that gives ˆτ = i [Hint, S0] is

[nF (ξk′ ↑) − nF (ξk↑)] [nB(ξk↑ − ξk′↑) − nB(−ωq)]

iω + ξk↑ − ξk′↑ + ωq

[nF (ξk′ ↓) − nF (ξk↓)] [nB(ξk↓ − ξk′↓) − nB(−ωq)]

iω + ξk↓ − ξk′↓ + ωq

.

Using analytical continuation and Imh 1

one obtains Eq. (17) of the main text,

x+iηi = −πδ(x),

in which the

U M (iω) response function does not contribute.

To see how the second derivative of spin current is

related to magnon density of states (DOS), consider the
integral in Eq. (17) of the main text denoted by ˜I. Taking
ﬁrst derivative with respect to µ0 gives

d ˜I
dµ0

= Z dξZ dΩ N↑ (ξ) N↓ (ξ + µ0 + Ω) NM (Ω)

×(cid:26)[nF (ξ + µ0 + Ω) − nF (ξ)]

dnB(−Ω − µ0)

dµ0

+

dnF (ξ + µ0 + Ω)

dµ0

[nB(−Ω − µ0) − nB(−Ω)](cid:27) ,

(29)

where we make the usual assumption that the DOS of
the probe (the NM) stays constant within the range of
measurement so dNσ/dµ0 = 0. Since dnB(−Ω− µ0)/dµ0
highly peaks at Ω = −µ0 at low temperature, the ﬁrst
term on the right hand side of Eq. (29) vanishes. Using
dnF (ξ + µ0 + Ω)/dµ0 = −δ(ξ + µ0 + Ω) to eliminate the
ξ integral, and taking another derivative of µ0 give

d2 ˜I
dµ2
0

= −Z dΩN↑(−Ω − µ0)N↓(0)NM (Ω)

dnB(−Ω − µ0)

dµ0

∝ N↑(0)N↓(0)NM (−µ0) ,

(30)

and so follows Eq. (18) of the main text.
