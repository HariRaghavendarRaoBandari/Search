ABSTRACT

We present Chandra ACIS-S sub-array observations of the quiescent neutron star low-mass X-ray
binaries X7 and X5 in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The large reduction in photon pile-up compared to
previous deep exposures enables a substantial improvement in the spectroscopic determination of the
neutron star radius and mass of these neutron stars. Modeling the thermal emission from the neutron
star surface with a non-magnetized hydrogen atmosphere and accounting for numerous sources of
uncertainties, we obtain for the neutron star in X7 a radius of R = 11.1+0.8
−0.7 km for an assumed stellar
mass of M = 1.4 M⊙ (68% C.L.). We argue, based on astrophysical grounds, that the presence of
a He atmosphere is unlikely for this source. Due to eclipses and variable absorption, the quiescent
low-mass X-ray binary X5 provides less stringent constraints, leading to a radius of R = 9.6+0.9
−1.1 km,
assuming a hydrogen atmosphere and a mass of M = 1.4 M⊙. When combined with all other existing
spectroscopic radius measurements, these measurements strongly favor radii in the 9.9−11.2 km range
for a ∼1.5 M⊙ neutron star and point to a dense matter equation of state that is somewhat softer
than the nucleonic ones that are consistent with laboratory experiments at low densities.

1. INTRODUCTION

The equation of state of cold, stable matter at den-
sities that exceed the nuclear saturation density (ρsat =
2.8×1014 g cm−3) remains one of the principal outstand-
ing problems in nuclear physics. Neutron stars (NSs)
provide a unique setting where the properties of neutron-
rich matter at extreme conditions can be probed. This is
because the mass-radius (M −R) relation of NSs is deter-
mined by the dense matter equation of state (EoS) and,
in turn, measuring the mass M and radius R of several
NSs with <10% errors can place strong limits on the EoS
at high densities (see, e.g., ¨Ozel et al. 2010; Steiner et al.
2010).

It is well established that observing thermal radiation
from the surface of a NS can serve as a useful tool to-
wards this end. For a NS radiating uniformly from its
entire surface, one can derive constraints on its mass
and radius by ﬁtting its spectrum with an appropri-
ate atmosphere model – when the surface composition
is known or can be determined from the X-ray spec-
trum itself – and combining the spectroscopic measure-
ments with the distance to the source. Low magnetic
ﬁeld (≪1010 G) sources are typically chosen for such
studies so that the radiation transport or temperature
distribution on the stellar surface are not aﬀected by
the magnetic ﬁeld (see reviews by ¨Ozel 2013; Potekhin
2014). These criteria are met in quiescent low-mass X-
ray binaries (qLMXBs) containing NSs and, in particu-

lar, for those located in globular clusters, to which the
distances are well-constrained (Rutledge et al. 2002). In
these systems, the heat stored in the NSs is believed to
be deposited by nuclear fusion in the deep crust dur-
ing accretion, and is reradiated from the whole surface
when accretion ceases, producing a long-lived thermal
glow (Brown et al. 1998; Campana et al. 1998). Their
low magnetic ﬁelds (∼108−9 G) as well as their primarily
thermal spectra make qLMXBs fairly clean laboratories
for studies of fundamental NS physics. As such, they can
provide potentially strong constraints on NS structure
that are complementary to those obtained using other
techniques.

The observed thermal X-ray radiation from qLMXBs is
modeled by light-element atmospheres because the light-
est element that is present ﬂoats to the top of the at-
mosphere due to rapid gravitational settling on neutron
star surfaces. Light-element atmospheres shift the peak
of the emitted radiation to higher energies compared to
a Planck spectrum of the same eﬀective temperature
because of the strong dependence of free-free absorp-
tion on photon energy and the large temperature gra-
dients in such atmospheres (Rajagopal & Romani 1996;
Zavlin et al. 1996). By applying the non-magnetic NS
hydrogen atmosphere models of Zavlin et al. (1996) to
X-ray observations of qLMXBs, Rutledge et al. (1999,
2001a,b) obtained the ﬁrst broad constraints on their
radii. These earlier analyses of X-ray spectra from
neutron stars with hydrogen atmosphere models pro-
duced radius estimates that are in reasonable agree-
ment with theoretical predictions. These ﬁndings mo-
tivated a host of subsequent observations primarily us-
ing Chandra and, to a lesser extent, XMM-Newton, in
an attempt to place tighter constraints on the NS ra-
dius. The known qLMXBs in globular clusters, in par-
ticular, have been subject of intensive studies, including

in NGC 6397 (Guillot et al. 2011; Heinke et al. 2014),
source 26 in M28 (Becker et al. 2003; Servillat et al.

2002; Gendre et al. 2003b; Heinke et al. 2014), and M30
(Lugger et al. 2007; Guillot & Rutledge 2014).

Radius constraints obtained for qLMXBs from the dif-
ferent analyses have been combined and used for con-
straining the neutron star EoS. Guillot et al. (2013) ap-
plied Bayesian analysis techniques on the data for ﬁve
qLMXBs to determine the combined mass-radius rela-
tion. In this study, a number of sources of measurement
uncertainty were incorporated into the ﬁnal constraints,
but some systematic uncertainties were not explored
(Lattimer & Steiner 2014; Heinke et al. 2014). These in-
clude the possibility of a helium instead of hydrogen at-
mosphere for a subset of the sources as well as the eﬀects
of the model used for the relative abundances of the in-
tervening absorbing material on the derived radius con-
straints. In a subsequent study of six qLMXBs, includ-
ing those from Guillot et al. (2013), ¨Ozel et al. (2015)
carried out a uniform analysis of these sources, taking
into account the additional sources of uncertainty and
found good agreement between all measurements. Fur-
thermore, combining the qLMXB measurements with
the radius measurements obtained during thermonuclear
bursts led to a combined NS radius of 10.1 − 11.1 km
(95% C.L.) and to tight constraints on the dense matter
equation of state. This comprehensive study, however,
excluded two of the earlier qLMXB radius constraints,
namely those of X5 and X7 (Heinke et al. 2003, 2006)
due to concerns in the quality of the spectral data in
these earlier Chandra observations, as we describe below.
The globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104) hosts X7 and
X5, with the highest and second-highest X-ray ﬂux at
Earth of any qLMXB in a globular cluster, making them
well-suited targets for NS EoS constraints. A 270-ks
Chandra observation of 47 Tuc in 2002 (Heinke et al.
2005) produced a spectrum of X7 with a high number
of counts, which allowed the ﬁrst measurements on the
mass and radius of this source (Heinke et al. 2006). Us-
ing the nsatmos hydrogen atmosphere model in XSPEC,
for an assumed NS mass of 1.4 M⊙, the stellar radius
was constrained to be 14.5+1.8
−1.6 km (90% C.L.). However,
because the 270-ks Chandra ACIS-S exposure of 47 Tuc
was obtained in full-frame mode with a read-out time of
3.2 seconds, X7 suﬀered from strong event pile-up.5 This
resulted in substantial degradation in the quality of the
spectrum. Furthermore, an extra model component to
account for pile-up was required when ﬁtting the spec-
trum, with a pile-up parameter that was estimated to be
15% in the 2002 full-frame dataset.

It is diﬃcult to quantify the systematic uncertainty in-
troduced into the radius measurement by pile-up for two
reasons. First, even though the pile-up correction is the-
oretically sound and veriﬁed to give reasonable results,

5 Pile-up occurs when two or more photons, arriving at the same
detector pixel during one frame time, are erroneously identiﬁed as a
single photon with the sum of the photon energies or else altogether
discarded (Davis 2001). The result is a distortion of the intrinsic
shape of the source spectrum.

is not as well-calibrated as Chandra’s performance in the
absence of pile-up, especially when the pile-up fraction is
as high as 15% (Steiner et al. 2010). Second, the inferred
radius is highly sensitive to the spectral shape, which is
not possible to fully correct for. In light of this, it is clear
that minimizing pile-up is critical for obtaining reliable
constraints on the NS M − R relation with qLMXBs.

X5,

an X-ray binary that

is viewed edge-on
(Heinke et al. 2003), on the other hand, shows eclipses
with an 8.7-hour period and irregular energy-dependent
dipping. The hydrogen column density NH to X5 was
high and variable during the 2002 ACIS-S observations
but less so during the 2000 ACIS-I and 2005 HRC-S ob-
servations. The accretion disk in X5 appears to precess,
occasionally blocking the view of the NS, as it did in
2002. Therefore, a clear view of the NS was necessary to
obtain an improved M − R measurement for this target.
Here, we present new Chandra ACIS-S subarray ob-
servations of X5 and X7, totaling 181 ks, optimized for
NS EoS constraints via X-ray spectroscopy. We show
that the data suﬀer minimally from pile-up in the new
observations and lead to radius constraints that are sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of the earlier studies of
X5 and X7. Furthermore, we show that the new radius
measurements are in excellent agreement with those from
other qLMXBs and thermonuclear bursters.

The paper is organized as follows. In §2 we describe
the observations and data reduction procedure.
In §3,
we assess the relevance of a number of causes of mea-
surement bias and error, while we present the results of
our spectroscopic analysis in §4.
In §5 we discuss the
implications of our ﬁndings and oﬀer conclusions in §6.

2. OBSERVATIONS

For the analysis presented here, we focus on new Chan-
dra ACIS-S exposures totaling 181 ks that were acquired
between 2014 September and 2015 February. The ob-
servations are summarized in Table 1. During the ex-
posures, only the ACIS-S3 chip was active and was con-
ﬁgured in a custom 1/8 sub-array, which restricts the
region of the CCD in which data is taken to 128 rows,
starting at row 449 (inclusive). This 1/8 subarray aﬀords
a 0.4 s frame time, which dramatically reduces the pile-
up fraction of moderately bright sources such as X7 and
X5.

The data extraction was carried out using CIAO6
(Fruscione et al. 2006) version 4.7 and the correspond-
ing calibration database (CALDB 4.6.7). For each ob-
servation, the source counts were extracted from circular
regions of radius 2.5′′ centered on the wavdetect-derived
positions of both X5 and X7, which enclose ≈95% of the
total source energy. The background was obtained from a
source-free region on the image. The spectra from the in-
dividual observations were generated using specextract
and were co-added using the combine spectra task in
CIAO. Due to known spectral calibration issues with
ACIS-S data around 0.4 keV, we restrict our spectro-
scopic analysis to energies ≥0.5 keV.

Using the CIAO tool pileup map, we determined that
the highest count rates per frame were 0.029 and 0.025 for
X7 and X5, respectively, corresponding to a pile-up level
of ≈1%. While there are archival sub-array observations
from 2000 and 2002, they were acquired in a 1/4 array
size, which provides a 0.8 s readout time and hence a
higher pile-up fraction. Based on this and the short total
exposure of these data (26 ks), we do not consider them in
the spectral analysis used to derive the M −R constraints
presented below. We do, however, make use of these
observations to examine the long-term variability of X7.

3. SOURCES OF MEASUREMENT BIAS

In order to utilize qLMXBs as high-precision probes
of NS structure, it is important to explore and quan-
tify the eﬀect of any instrument or modeling uncertain-
ties on the desired NS M − R measurement. Following
the investigations presented in Heinke et al. (2014) and
¨Ozel et al. (2015), we examine in this section several po-
tentially important sources of measurement uncertainty
and bias that may aﬀect the EOS constraints obtained
for X7 and X5.

3.1. Variability

Rapid (seconds/hours) and long-term (∼years) vari-
ability in qLMXBs is often taken as an indicator of on-
going low-level accretion onto the neutron star. In such
an event, the assumptions of a steady-state, passively
cooling atmosphere, a purely thermal ﬂux from the sur-
face, or a uniformly hot star may no longer be valid.
Walsh et al. (2015) and Bahramian et al. (2015) have
evaluated the variability of the thermal emission from
9 and 12 qLMXBs, respectively (see also Heinke et al.
2006; Guillot et al. 2011; Heinke et al. 2014, for individ-
ual sources). For the 7 qLMXBs with purely thermal
spectra, there is no evidence for temperature variations
over ∼10 years down to levels of 11%.

The multi-epoch and high-quality Chandra ACIS data
set of X7 spanning ∼15 years allows us to place substan-
tially stricter limits on the variability of its thermal radi-
ation using spectral ﬁts to the 2014/2015 combined data,
and to the 2000 and 2002 subarray data7. For the most
stringent test, we kept all parameters ﬁxed except for the
temperature in 2014/2015 and 2000/2002, which were al-
lowed to vary independently. We ﬁnd that the tempera-
tures are virtually identical; at 90% conﬁdence there is no

7 Because the extensive (∼800 ks) Chandra HRC-S data set

provides no spectral information, it is not useful in this regard.

addition of a power-law component (dotted lines) with index 1.0
(blue), 1.5 (magenta), and 2.0 (red). The dashed line shows the
best-ﬁt model (nsatmos) for purely thermal hydrogen atmosphere
emission. For reference, the unfolded Chandra sub-array data of

observable temperature variation greater than 0.9% be-
tween the 2000/2002 and 2014/2015 epochs. Testing the
normalization (which would correspond to any change in
the emitting area) instead, we place an upper limit of 4%
to any change in normalization at 90% conﬁdence. This
is an indication that the observed radiation from X7 is
indeed due to passive transport of the heat deposited in
the stellar core during outbursts rather than continuing
accretion.

In contrast, the thermal X-ray ﬂux of X5 is highly vari-
able on short timescales (minutes to hours). However,
this variability appears not to be due to on-going ac-
cretion but rather due to X5 being an edge-on system.
This geometric conﬁguration results in occultations of
the neutron star and variable absorption by the gas as-
sociated with the residual accretion disk. As detailed in
§4, this necessitates the excision of a large fraction of
the data for X5 in order to recover the intrinsic steady
ﬂux from the neutron star. Additionally, due to disk
precession, the NS was completely obscured during the
deep 2002 exposures, making it diﬃcult to fully assess
the long term variability of the thermal component for
X5. These diﬃculties make X5 results less reliable than
those for X7.

3.2. Additional Spectral Components

Another usual cause for concern for the measurements
of the neutron star radius from spectra is the possibil-
ity of additional, fainter X-ray emission components that
have not been taken into account in the spectral mod-
eling. In several qLMXBs, the presence of a power-law
component in the quiescent ﬂux suggests on-going ac-
cretion at a low rate8 (e.g., Garcia et al. 2001). Alter-
natively, “contaminating” power-law emission may arise
due to a rotation-powered pulsar wind turning on in

8 The best evidence for accretion at low luminosities in neu-
tron star low-mass X-ray binaries comes from the recent detection
of accretion-powered pulsations with power-law spectra at qui-
escent levels (∼1033 erg s−1) in the nearby millisecond pulsars
PSR J1023+0038 and XSS J12270–4859 (Archibald et al. 2015;
Papitto et al. 2015).

quiescence (see, e.g., Campana et al. 1998; Jonker et al.
2004) or unidentiﬁed blended sources in the crowded
globular cluster core.
It is possible that such a com-
ponent is present at a very low level in the seemingly
purely thermal qLMXBs but may still skew the NS ra-
dius measurement signiﬁcantly if it is not accounted for.
In particular, the presence of a power-law component
would harden the spectrum so that a ﬁt with a purely
thermal model would produce a higher temperature and,
therefore, M − R limits that are shifted towards lower
radii.

To test this scenario, we introduced an additional
power-law component into the model ﬁts. Figure 1 il-
lustrates the maximum possible contribution of a power-
law component to the model spectrum of X7 for photon
indices in the range typical for quiescent LMXB power-
laws, Γ = 1.0 − 2.0 (Campana et al. 1998; Cackett et al.
2010; Chakrabarty et al. 2014). The addition of a power-
law results in a diﬀerence of 0.1% in the inferred nomi-
nal NS radius and its associated uncertainties, while the
best ﬁts with and without this component diﬀer in χ2
by a statistically insigniﬁcant 0.03. We found a simi-
lar result for X5, where the introduction of a power-law
causes a change of only 0.5% in the NS radius conﬁdence
limits. For X7 and X5, we also derive limits of ≤0.2%
and ≤1.6%, respectively, for any power-law component
in the subarray spectra. We thus conclude that power-
law emission is negligible for both of these qLMXBs and
do not further consider a power-law component in the
spectroscopic analyses that follow.

3.3. Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere

Given their transiently accreting nature, the thin at-
mospheric layer on the neutron stars found in qLMXBs
most likely consists of material that has the compo-
sition of their companion star. For a hydrogen rich
donor, due to gravitational settling, hydrogen is expected
to surface within seconds and thus dominate the sur-
face emission (Alcock & Illarionov 1980; Hameury et al.
1983; Brown et al. 2002).

For X5, the measured 8.7-hour orbit (Heinke et al.
2003) implies that the donor star is hydrogen-rich and,
therefore, the neutron star almost certainly has a pure
hydrogen atmosphere. In the case of X7, due to the lack
of any information regarding the orbital period or the
properties of the secondary star, the chemical composi-
tion of the accreted material is less certain. For exam-
ple, this system may be an ultra-compact binary (with
an orbital period .80 min), in which case the compan-
ion star may be a helium star or a C-O core white dwarf
that has surface layers (mostly) devoid of hydrogen (see,
e.g., Nelemans & Jonker 2010). In light of this possibil-
ity, Servillat et al. (2012), Catuneanu et al. (2013), and
Heinke et al. (2014) have considered He atmosphere ﬁts
to qLMXB spectra when there is no information about
the nature of the companion. These ﬁts produce signiﬁ-
cantly larger inferred NS masses and radii compared to
H atmosphere models, owing to the larger diﬀerence be-
tween the eﬀective and color temperatures for He atmo-
sphere emission. These results highlight the importance
of the chemical composition of the NS surface layer on
the NS M and R measurements.

Even in the case of an ultracompact binary and a
hydrogen-poor companion, the question remains as to

Fig. 2.— The best-ﬁt absorbed hydrogen atmosphere (nsatmos)

model: Wilms et al. (2000), Asplund et al. (2009), and Lodders
(2003). Note the linear scale on the ordinate for the photon ﬂux.

sorbed nsatmos model assuming Wilms abundances is shown for

whether even trace amounts of hydrogen in the donor are
suﬃcient to cover the neutron star surface with hydro-
gen. An optical depth of ∼unity can be achieved with a
layer of hydrogen of thickness ∼1 cm on the neutron star
surface, which requires only ∼10−20 M⊙ of H (see, e.g.,
Zavlin & Pavlov 2002 and Eq. (20) of ¨Ozel 2013). As a
result, even in the case of an ultracompact binary with
accretion from a He-rich donor, minute abundances of
H can still result in a hydrogen dominated atmosphere.
An alternative means of accumulating a hydrogen at-
mosphere may be through nuclear spallation reactions
of nuclei heavier than helium. However, it is not cer-
tain whether spallation always produces H during accre-
tion (Bildsten et al. 1992, 1993). On the other hand, H
can be depleted from the photospheric layer via diﬀusive
nuclear burning by an underlying layer of nuclei that
are able to capture protons (see, e.g., Chang & Bildsten
2004; Chang et al. 2010). Due to this ambiguity regard-
ing the atmospheric composition, in §4 we present ﬁts
with both H and He atmospheres for X7.

3.4. Interstellar Absorption

Photoelectric absorption by the interstellar medium
along the line of sight to the qLMXB signiﬁcantly al-
ters the intrinsic thermal spectrum of the NS, especially
in the very soft X-ray band. Thus, a reliable constraint
on the hydrogen column density along the line of sight,
NH, is important for robust NS EoS constraints (see, e.g.,
Lattimer & Steiner 2014, and references therein). In ad-
dition to the total column density, the observed shape
of the thermal spectrum is also sensitive to the chemi-
cal abundances of the intervening material. As a conse-
quence, the inferred M − R constraints may diﬀer based
on the assumed ISM abundances. This is especially true
for targets with large values of column density NH since
the absorption edges due to metals (whose depth depends
on the relative abundances) become much more promi-
nent.

As demonstrated by Heinke et al. (2014), the strong
sensitivity of the inferred NS radius on the choice of
ISM abundances implies that low-NH targets are best

suited for the neutron star EOS constraints.
In addi-
tion, the latest abundances and most complete absorp-
tion models that are appropriate for the ISM should be
used in the spectral analyses. The currently best avail-
able abundances for the ISM (as opposed to values de-
rived from the solar spectrum) is that of Wilms et al.
(2000) (wilm in XSPEC, incorporated into the absorp-
tion model tbabs), which we use in our analysis. Never-
theless, to test the sensitivity of the results on the ab-
sorption model, we also repeated the spectroscopic ﬁts by
implementing two other abundance models available in
XSPEC: aspl (Asplund et al. 2009) and lodd (Lodders
2003), both of which are based on solar abundances. As
is evident from Figure 2, the choice of absorption model
does not alter the model spectral shape above ∼0.5 keV
due to the exceptionally low absorbing column towards
47 Tuc (NH = 1.3 × 1020 cm−2). Therefore, using dif-
ferent abundance models has virtually no eﬀect on the
derived M − R relation. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁxed M = 1.4
M⊙, the best ﬁt value and associated uncertainties of R
diﬀer by less than 0.6% among the three abundance mod-
els. As shown below, for both X7 and X5 this level of
uncertainty introduced by the choice of abundance model
is dwarfed by the uncertainties due to instrument cali-
bration.

3.5. Distance Uncertainty

Another important source of uncertainty in the ra-
dius measurements is the distance to the target qLMXB,
which scales linearly with the NS radius. Globular clus-
ter distances have been constrained using a variety of
diﬀerent methods, each of which has its own statistical
and systematic errors (which may not always be well-

characterized). Fortunately, 47 Tuc has been a target for
multiple distance investigations, giving us the opportu-
nity to compare the results from multiple methods. In
addition, the reddening to 47 Tuc is very small and well
measured, nearly eliminating the concern about degen-
eracy between distance and reddening with measuring
globular cluster distances9.

A compilation of 22 distance measurements to 47 Tuc,
is given in Table 1 of
using seven general methods,
Woodley et al. (2012). The methods include the bright-
ness of the horizontal branch, ﬁtting an isochrone to the
main sequence, cluster kinematics, RR Lyrae stars, the
tip of the red giant branch, eclipsing binaries, and white
dwarfs. We add to this list the recent white dwarf cool-
ing sequence measurement of Hansen et al. (2013), which
reports a distance modulus of (m − M )0 = 13.32 ± 0.09
magnitudes. Following Woodley et al. (2012), we cal-
culated the weighted mean of all these estimates and
the error in this mean to obtain a distance modulus of
(m − M )0 = 13.31 ± 0.02, corresponding to a distance
of d = 4.59 ± 0.04 kpc. For this calculation, (i) we as-
sumed errors of 0.20 magnitudes for literature estimates
without errors, (ii) we added statistical and systematic
errors in quadrature, and (iii) chose the estimate with bi-
nary corrections from the main-sequence ﬁtting analyses
of Gratton et al. (2003) and Carretta et al. (2000).

This analysis has several weaknesses. First, multi-
ple measurements using the same method may lead to
smaller statistical uncertainties but still contain a bias.
Second, improvements in a method over time may not be

9 As discussed in Heinke et al. (2014), no individual method, not
even cluster kinematics, is entirely free of systematic uncertainties.

reﬂected in the ﬁnal calculation if all measurements are
assigned equal weights. Finally, the ﬁnal measurement
could be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by results from a single
ﬂawed method. To address these, we performed a test
by selecting the subset of more recent distance measure-
ments, i.e., those carried out since 2000. We also under-
took “jackknife” analyses, where we removed all mea-
surements taken with one method to assess how much
the ﬁnal result changes and used the results of this ex-
ercise as another measure of the systematic error. When
using the measurements since 2000, we ﬁnd a distance
modulus of (m − M )0 = 13.28 ± 0.02 or a distance of
d = 4.53 ± 0.04 kpc, which is consistent with the dis-
tance measurement from the full sample. Our jackknife
tests ﬁnd a range of distance moduli from 13.27 to 13.31,
which are also consistent with the results from the full
sample. Combining the jackknife errors with the error in
the mean in quadrature, we arrive at a ﬁnal range in dis-
tance modulus of 13.26 − 13.32 and, thus, a ﬁnal distance
measurement of d = 4.53+0.08

−0.04 kpc.

We note that we excluded from our distance analysis
the most recent measurement of Watkins et al. (2015),
who obtained a signiﬁcantly smaller dynamical distance
for 47 Tuc (d = 4.15 ± 0.08 kpc), compared to the mean
value derived above. This is because we believe that this
reported value is aﬀected by problems in some of the
radial velocity data used in that study. Dynamical dis-
tances are derived by comparing angular proper motions
on the sky (typically from multiple Hubble Space Tele-
scope epochs) with radial velocity dispersions of bright
stars. The radial velocity measurements carried out by

McLaughlin et al. (2006) and Lane et al. (2010) were of
individual stars, but these studies did not check whether
multiple stars might be blended together (as attempted
by Gebhardt et al. 1995). Such blending tends to depress
the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the central regions.
Indeed, such blending within the central ∼1′ can be ver-
iﬁed by comparing the positions of stars used for radial
velocities in 47 Tuc by McLaughlin et al. (2006) with the
HST image provided in the same paper, and the radial
velocity measurements within this central region show
more scatter than elsewhere. Watkins et al. (2015) only
used velocity dispersion information from the central re-
gions (within <100′′) for their primary analysis, to en-
sure that proper motions and radial velocity dispersions
were compared within the same region. However, in an
Appendix, Watkins et al. (2015) show that including ve-
locity dispersion information from the outer regions leads
to a larger inferred distance of 4.61 ± 0.08 kpc. Thus, we
have a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between
the ﬁducial distance reported by Watkins et al. (2015),
and the larger distance supported by photometric meth-
ods, and by the consideration of a larger radial velocity
database.

3.6. Instrument Calibration Uncertainties

The spectroscopic M −R measurement technique using
qLMXBs discussed herein relies on an absolute determi-
nation of the ﬂux emitted from the neutron star. Be-
cause of this, it depends strongly on the reliability of the
calibration of the instrument used for the measurement.

3.7. Photon Pile-up

As noted previously, Chandra ACIS data of even mod-
erately bright sources is susceptible to severe event pile-
up owing to the combination of slow readout and high
count rate. While we mitigated most of this negative ef-
fect in the new subarray observations by using a faster
detector readout mode, it still aﬀects the data at a low
level. The spectroscopic mass-radius measurement tech-
nique for qLMXBs is highly sensitive to the shape of the
thermal spectrum. As a consequence, even a small artif-
ical distortion in the spectral shape can bias the M − R
measurement. For pile-up speciﬁcally, a portion of the
photons piled at lower energies are either rejected en-
tirely (if their event grades are consistent with those of
cosmic rays) or recorded as a singe photon displaced to
higher energies. As reported in §2, this occurs for ∼1%
of the photons in the X7 and X5 spectra, which we would
naively expect to be negligible.

To assess the impact of this seemingly small eﬀect
on our results, we repeated our spectroscopic ﬁts with
and without a pile-up model component (i.e., pileup in
XSPEC). Figure 3 illustrates the results for X7, showing
the 68% conﬁdence contours in the M − R plane with
and without pile-up. Despite the small degree of pile-
up, the impact on the results is substantial. In addition
to enlarging the conﬁdence intervals, correcting for pile-
up displaces them towards somewhat larger M and R.
This arises because photon pile-up artiﬁcially hardens
the intrinsic source spectrum, which produces a higher
best-ﬁt temperature and hence a smaller inferred stellar
radius. The enlargement of the conﬁdence contours arises
principally from the statistical uncertainty in the pile-up
parameter α, which gives the probability of rejection of
piled events. Some of the displacement in the contours
may also be due to adding another parameter to the ﬁt
when applying pile-up correction. In light of these ﬁnd-
ings, to ensure robust constraints on the NS M and R,

ACIS detectors is limited by a combination of the un-
certainties in the quantum eﬃciency near the read out,
the quantum eﬃciency non-uniformity across the detec-
tor resulting from charge transfer ineﬃciencies, and the
depth of the contaminant on the ACIS ﬁlter (important
primarily below ∼2 keV).

Following Guillot et al. (2013), we adopt a 3% system-
atic error to account for the instrument response uncer-
tainties. We note that an in-depth evaluation of Chan-
dra calibration uncertainties in the context of qLMXB
NS M − R measurements based on the prescriptions

pile-up correction should be incorporated into spectral
modeling even for small (∼1-2%) pile-up fractions.

4. RESULTS OF THE SPECTROSCOPIC

ANALYSES

Having explored the various sources of formal and sys-
tematic errors, we performed the optimal spectroscopic
ﬁts in XSPEC using the nsatmos H atmosphere model
(Heinke et al. 2006) for both X5 and X7 as well as the
non-magnetic He atmosphere variant of the nsx addi-
tive table model (Ho & Heinke 2009) for X7. We also
tested the nsagrav (Zavlin et al. 1996) H atmosphere
model to identify any discrepancies in the measured ra-
dius and mass relative to nsatmos, which may arise due
to diﬀerences between the numerical models used to con-
struct them. The nsatmos and nsagrav models pro-
duce virtually identical results for the expected range
of combinations of M and R. We chose the former in
this analysis since it is deﬁned over a larger range of M
and R. To account for interstellar absorption and scat-
tering, we used the tbabs model (Wilms et al. 2000).
We further included the correction for the eﬀect of pile-
up, as discussed above. Thus, in what follows, we ap-
plied the multiplicative pileup model in XSPEC on the
absorbed atmosphere model under consideration (i.e.,
pileup*tbabs*nsatmos). For the distance parameter in
the nsatmos and nsx models, we restricted the allowed
range of values to 4.49 − 4.61 kpc based on the discussion
presented in §3.5. Finally, to incorporate the instrumen-
tal calibration uncertainty, we applied an additional 3%
measurement error through the systematic command in
XSPEC. The best ﬁt parameters for the various model
for both X5 and X7 are summarized in Table 2.

In order to produce the ﬁnal conﬁdence contours for
X5 and X7 and use a Bayesian approach to infer the
NS EoS parameters from the M − R measurements, we
ﬁrst convert the χ2 surfaces generated in XSPEC to a
posterior likelihood over M and R. For this purpose, we
take advantage of additional information, namely, that
no plausible EoS models predict neutron stars with radii
below ≈7 km and that stellar evolution is not expected to
produce low mass neutron stars with .0.5 M⊙. Thus, we
impose that for R ≤ 7 km or M ≤ 0.5 M⊙, the likelihood
goes to zero.

4.1. X5

The new 1/8 subarray Chandra ACIS data set re-
veal that, for the majority of the time, the accretion
disk does not completely obscure the neutron star in
X5. However, during the two shortest exposures (Ob-
sIDs 15748 and 17420) the system appears highly vari-
able, possibly due to obscuration by the accretion disk.
As already known from the 2000 and 2005 Chandra
data, the system undergoes regular, deep eclipses every
8.666 hours as well as dips occurring ∼2000 s prior to
the main eclipse, which exhibit an enhancement in NH
(Heinke et al. 2003). Therefore, it is necessary to care-
fully excise the intervals in which X5 suﬀered eclipses
and dips from our initial spectral analysis. To accom-
plish this, we extracted spectra using diﬀerent time cuts
around the eclipses and dips and ﬁtted the spectra to
check for any appreciable changes in the derived param-
eters. We show the results in Figure 4.

Throughout the orbit, X5 also exhibits rapid energy-
dependent ﬂux variability, with a spectral hardening at
lower count rates. As our line of sight presumably grazes
the accretion disk, this variability is most likely due to
absorption by material from the disk. It is evident from
Figure 4 that the variable nature of X5 can result in
skewed M − R measurements. In light of this, we took
great care to excise the time intervals around the eclipses
as well as instances of strong energy-dependent dimming.
We show in Figure 5 the temporal and count rate cuts we
applied to eliminate these portions of the data, which re-
sult in a 88.5 ks eﬀective exposure. We show in Figure 6
the ﬁtted X-ray continuum and in Figure 7 the resulting
68% and 95% conﬁdence contours for the mass and ra-
dius of X5 using the ﬁltered data. The results indicate
a neutron star radius R = 9.6+0.9
−1.1 km (at 68% C.L.) for
an assumed mass of M = 1.4 M⊙, with χ2
ν = 1.07 for 89
degrees of freedom. A radius of 12 km lies outside of the
68% conﬁdence contour and the mass is constrained to
M < 1.3 M⊙ for that radius at 95% conﬁdence level. We
note that the lower bound of the 68% conﬁdence interval
falls below M = 0.5 M⊙ where the nsatmos model has
not been calculated, since stellar evolution suggests that
such low-mass neutron stars are not produced.

4.2. X7

We repeated the analysis described above for X7 and
show in Figure 8 the total Chandra ACIS-S 1/8 sub-
array spectrum as well as the best-ﬁt H (nsatmos) and
He (nsx) atmosphere models, which produce statistically
similar ﬁts (with χ2
ν of 1.23 and 1.17, respectively). The
resulting 68% and 95% conﬁdence contours on the neu-
tron star mass and radius for both models are shown
in Figure 9. Assuming a H atmosphere and for M =
1.4 M⊙, we obtain a best ﬁt radius R = 11.1+0.8
−0.7 km. For
a He atmosphere, with the same ﬁxed mass, the ﬁt results
in R = 14.7+1.3
−0.9 km. If we instead hold the radius ﬁxed
at 12 km, the H atmosphere model results in a low neu-
tron star mass with a best ﬁt value of M = 1.1+0.3
−0.4 M⊙,
while the He model favors a massive neutron star with
M = 2.1+0.2
−0.2 M⊙. All uncertainties quoted above are at
a 68% conﬁdence level.

4.2.1. X7: Hydrogen or Helium?

As noted previously, while there are numerous theo-
retical reasons to expect a hydrogen atmosphere, in the
absence of any information regarding the orbital param-
eters and companion properties of X7, we cannot deﬁni-
tively determine whether the neutron star atmosphere is
dominated by hydrogen or helium. However, there are
some astrophysical arguments in favor of a lower-mass
star and hence a H atmosphere.

Neutrino emission and cooling mechanisms,

includ-
ing direct URCA, hyperon URCA, and quark core
cooling, have strong dependences on properties of the
core, such as density and proton fraction, and, there-
fore, on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star
mass (Yakovlev & Pethick 2004; Beznogov & Yakovlev
2015). The transiently accreting X-ray binary SAX
J1808.4−3658 has a very cold NS, compared to what
would be expected through “standard” cooling, whereas
most other observed NSs in X-ray binaries are much
warmer (see Heinke et al. 2007, 2009; Wijnands et al.

2013). The low temperature of SAX J1808.4−3658 sug-
gests it has a higher mass than that of other quies-
cent NSs, with the latter presumably near the typi-
cal mass of 1.4 M⊙ and current evidence pointing to
SAX J1808.4−3658 having MN S . 1.6 M⊙ (at ∼2σ)
(Wang et al. 2013).
In comparison, the relatively high
temperature of X7 suggests it has a comparable, if not
lower, mass, i.e., around 1.4 M⊙ or lighter. This is con-
trary to our He atmosphere ﬁts which yield M &1.7 M⊙
(see the right panel of Figure 9) and would result in a
X7 temperature that is at least as low as that of SAX
J1808.4−3658, contrary to observations.

We ﬁnd that a He atmosphere model would require ei-
ther a quite large radius or a high mass. A high mass
would be at odds with our current understanding of cool-

ing processes based on other qLMXBs, while a large ra-
dius (>14 km) would conﬂict both with the measure-
ments of the radius of X5 presented here, and with mea-
surements of other NSs (Guillot et al. 2011; Heinke et al.
2014; ¨Ozel et al. 2015), including the radius derived for
the NS in NGC 6397 for either H or He atmospheres.
Based on this line of reasoning, we argue that a hydrogen
composition for the atmosphere of X7 is more plausible.

5. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEUTRON STAR

EQUATION OF STATE

Most existing mass-radius measurements of neutron
star have uncertainties that are too large to oﬀer useful
constraints when considered individually. Nevertheless,

10

Bogdanov et al.

as shown recently in ¨Ozel et al. (2015), when taken as
an ensemble, these results can produce fairly tight con-
straints on the equation of state. We now add the M − R
measurements of X7 and X5 to those used in the earlier
study to infer the NS equation of state.

To accomplish this, we make use of the Bayesian
framework developed in ¨Ozel et al. (2015)
statistical
to measure the most likely dense matter equation of
state and the corresponding neutron star radii from
all of the spectroscopic measurements. This frame-
work makes use of parametric representations of the
equation of state and allows us to use these radius
measurements to directly infer the pressures at sev-
eral ﬁducial densities above the nuclear saturation den-
sity,
i.e., at ρ1 = 1.85 ρsat, ρ2 = 3.7 ρsat, and
ρ3 = 7.4 ρsat by exploiting the unique mapping be-
tween the pressure-density relation of cold supra-nuclear
matter and the neutron star M − R relation (Lindblom
1992; Lattimer & Prakash 2001; ¨Ozel & Psaltis 2009;
Read et al. 2009; Hebeler et al. 2010). This statistical
inference also allows us to consider additional informa-
tion and constraints on the dense matter equation of
state, such as the results of laboratory experiments in the
vicinity of nuclear saturation density (see Tsang et al.
2012; Lattimer & Lim 2013, and references therein), the
requirement for a ≥2 M⊙ maximum neutron star mass
(Demorest et al. 2010; Antoniadis et al. 2013),(also, see
reviews by Lattimer 2011; ¨Ozel & Freire 2016), the phys-
ical conditions of stability and causality for the para-
metric equation of state, as well as diﬀerent priors on
the pressures P1, P2, and P3 at the ﬁducial densities (see
Section 5 of ¨Ozel et al. 2015 for additional details).

Using this framework, we combine the radius likeli-
hoods for X7 and X5 presented here with those of the
twelve sources included in ¨Ozel et al. (2015) to infer the
posterior likelihoods over the pressures at the three ﬁdu-
cial densities.
In Figure 10, we show the mass-radius
relation that corresponds to the most likely triplet of
pressures that is derived from the combined likelihoods
of the fourteen sources as well as the priors on the EoS
discussed above. Speciﬁcally, these include the hydrogen
atmosphere results for X7, based on the arguments in
§5.1, as well as the six neutron stars for which thermonu-
clear burst data have been used to infer M and R and the
six qLMXBs analyzed in ¨Ozel et al. (2015). We also show
in Figure 10 the ranges of mass-radius relations that cor-
respond to the regions of the (P1, P2, P3) parameter space
in which the posterior likelihood is within e−1/2 and e−1
of its highest value. For comparison, we include in this
ﬁgure a small selection of proposed EoS with diﬀerent
compositions and calculation techniques (see ¨Ozel et al.
2015 for the acronyms and further details).

It is evident from this ﬁgure that the empirical equa-
tion of state that is preferred by the current radius
measurements is consistent with relatively small radii.
In particular, around 1.5M⊙, the 95% conﬁdence range
spans 9.9 to 11.2 km. This also indicates a fairly soft
EoS; i.e., a lower pressure at and above 2 ρsat than those
predicted by a number of nucleonic equations of state,
such as AP4 (Akmal et al. 1998) shown in this ﬁgure.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We presented spectroscopically derived neutron star
mass-radius constraints for the qLMXBs X5 and X7 in
the globular cluster 47 Tuc based on new Chandra obser-
vations that were speciﬁcally optimized for this purpose.
Although signiﬁcantly shorter than the previous 270-
ks ACIS-S full-frame exposure of 47 Tuc (Heinke et al.
2005), the 181-ks 1/8 subarray data of 47 Tuc we have
presented here results in much tighter constraints on the
M − R relation for X7. This is a direct consequence
of the use of a faster readout mode for the ACIS-S de-
tector, which signiﬁcantly reduced the pile-up fraction
(from ∼15% to ∼1%) and, therefore, the distortion of the
spectra due to the eﬀects of pile-up. Furthermore, this
substantially reduces the unquantiﬁed systematic uncer-
tainties introduced by pile-up, which exibits non-linear
behavior as a function of count rate and is not well cali-
brated. Indeed, the limits on M and R for X7 obtained
in Heinke et al. (2006, see, in particular, their Figure 2)
are only marginally consistent with those shown in Fig-
ure 9 using the same nsatmos H atmosphere model. This
leads us to conclude that qLMXB data aﬀected by a high
pile-up fraction are not useful for reliable NS EoS con-
straints.

Another important ﬁnding of our evaluation of sources
of measurement uncertainty described in §3 is that even
at a level of ∼1%, ignoring photon pile-up in the spec-
troscopic ﬁts can lead to not only underestimated uncer-
tainties but also a skewed measurement (as illustrated in
Figures 3 and 4). This suggests that all previous qLMXB
analyses that have not applied any necessary pile-up cor-
rections in the spectroscopic ﬁts should be re-examined.
(Note that pile-up is well below 1% for a number of Chan-
dra observations of qLMXBs and the previous analyses
of the qLMXB in M28 take into account a pile-up cor-
rection for a ∼ 4% pile-up fraction in those data; see
Guillot et al. 2013.)

Unlike most other globular cluster qLMXBs, the ob-
served spectra of X7 and X5 are not strongly attenuated
by photoelectric absorption from interstellar gas. As a re-
sult, the spectroscopic constraints we have obtained here
do not suﬀer from appreciable uncertainties due to lack
of information on the relative chemical abundances of the
interstellar medium (see Heinke et al. 2014, , for further
details). When taken together with other factors, such
as the well-determined distance to 47 Tuc, this makes
the X7 radius measurements and the resulting NS EoS
constraints presented here some of the most robust based
on this spectrosopic technique.

The mass and radius constraints we ﬁnd for X5 and
X7 through these new observations are highly consistent
with the twelve other spectroscopic radius measurements
that have been performed to date for qLMXBs and ther-
monuclear bursters (see ¨Ozel et al. 2015). The increase
in the radius measurements as well as the consistency of
the results for diﬀerent sources with a variety of diﬀerent
uncertainties increases our conﬁdence in these measure-
ments. Furthermore, it allows us to place increasingly
tighter constraints on the dense matter equation of state,
especially when combined with other measurements, such
as nuclear experiments near nuclear saturation density
and the high neutron star masses measured through pul-
sar timing.

Indeed, by combining the results for X5 and X7 with

Fig. 10.— The mass-radius relation (solid blue curve) corresponding to the most likely triplet of pressures that agrees with the current
neutron star data. These include the X5 and X7 radius measurements shown in this work, as well the neutron star radii measurements
for the twelve neutron stars included in ¨Ozel et al. (2015), the low energy nucleon-nucleon scattering data, and the requirement that the
EoS allow for a M > 1.97M⊙ neutron star. The ranges of mass-radius relations corresponding to the regions of the (P1, P2, P3) parameter
space in which the likelihood is within e−1/2 and e−1 of its highest value are shown in dark and light blue bands, respectively. The results
for both ﬂat priors in P1, P2, and P3 (left panel) and for ﬂat priors the logarithms of these pressures (right panel) are shown.

existing M −R measurements from other qLMXB as well
as bursting neutron stars, we obtain increasingly more
robust constraints on the neutron star equation of state.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the preferred equation of state
that is empirically derived from the measurements of all
fourteen sources predicts radii between 9.9 and 11.2 km
around M = 1.5M⊙ (corresponding to the range where
the likelihood falls to e−1 of its maximum value). This
also implies a relatively low pressure around twice nu-
clear saturation density, which most directly aﬀects neu-
tron star radii. We ﬁnd that such an equation of state
can easily produce ∼ 2M⊙ neutron stars that is observed
through radio pulsar timing. This preferred equation of
state is softer than some purely nucleonic equations of
state that are tuned to ﬁt experiments at low densities,
such as AP4, and may point to new degrees of freedom
appearing around ∼ 2 ρsat in neutron-rich matter.
