In Nature Phys. 11, 668 (2015) (Ref. [1]), a composite particle prepared in a pure initial quantum state and
propagated in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld is shown to undergo a decoherence process at a rate determined by
the gravitational acceleration. By assuming Einstein’s Equivalence Principle to be valid, we demonstrate, ﬁrst
in a Lorentz frame with accelerating detectors, and then directly in the Lab frame with uniform gravity, that
the dephasing between the diﬀerent internal states arise not from gravity but rather from diﬀerences in their
rest mass, and the mass dependence of the de Broglie wave’s dispersion relation. We provide an alternative
view to the situation considered by Ref. [1], where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role in the loss
of fringe visibility by giving the detector a transverse velocity relative to the particle beam; visibility can be
easily recovered by giving the screen an appropriate uniform velocity. We ﬁnally propose that dephasing due
to gravity may in fact take place for certain modiﬁcations to the gravitational potential where the Equivalence
Principle is violated.

Introduction.– Exciting new ideas have recently been put for-
ward to explore the interplay between quantum mechanics
and gravity using precision measurement experiments, for ex-
ample testing the quantum evolution of self-gravitating ob-
jects [2], searching for modiﬁcations to the canonical com-
mutation relation [3], and studying propagation of quan-
tum wavefunctions in an external gravitational ﬁeld [4, 5].
Pikovski et al. recently pointed out that a composite particle,
prepared in an initial product quantum state between its “cen-
ter of mass” and its internal state, will undergo a universal
decoherence process with respect to its spatial degrees of free-
dom in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld — as exhibited by a loss
of visibility in matter-wave interferometry experiments [1].
More speciﬁcally, they evolved the composite particle’s wave-
function in the Rindler coordinate system, and discovered a
dephasing between its multiple components, at a rate propor-
tional to the gravitational acceleration.

According to Einstein’s Equivalence Principle (EEP),
freely falling experiments cannot detect the magnitude of the
absolute gravitational acceleration [6]. Of course, the setup in
Ref. [1] is not in free fall: the screen detecting the particle is
at rest in the Lab frame and accelerating in the Lorentz frame.
This means their result is not necessarily in contradiction with
the EEP. Nevertheless, it is still interesting to explain why the
dephasing, which takes place during the particle’s free prop-
agation, has a rate determined by gravity. At this point, we
note that the Rindler coordinate system is attached to the de-
tector: calculating the dephasing of wavefunctions in that co-
ordinate system mixes together eﬀects due to free propagation
and those due to the detector’s acceleration.

In this paper, we will ﬁrst separate the propagation and de-
tection processes. In a Lorentz frame, the internal states of the
composite particle do not interact with external potentials or
with each other, and are distinguished only by their rest mass.
Therefore, we can treat each internal state as an independently
propagating free particle species labeled by its rest mass m.

We will allow the screen to travel along an arbitrary transverse
trajectory in one dimension with respect to the particle beam,
and compute the interference pattern it registers by evaluat-
ing the particle ﬂux over the spacetime volume spanned by
the screen over measurement lifetime. The results from this
perspective oﬀer a clear alternative explanation for the loss
of fringe visibility:
in the Lorentz frame, the mass depen-
dent de Broglie wave dispersion relation gives each species
a mass dependent propagation velocity. This causes them to
separate along the propagation axis and to arrive at the de-
tector at diﬀerent times. The detector then registers an inter-
ference pattern for each species, and if the detector is mov-
ing transversely to particle propagation (as is the case in the
view of gravity being equivalent to acceleration), then the pat-
terns from diﬀerent species will be shifted along the direction
of detector motion. This is equivalent to a mass dependent
phase shift, and summing over all masses will result in visi-
bility loss.

Viewed in the Lorentz frame, the ﬁnal result is simple and
intuitive. However, a rigorous calculation requires a quantum
description of the particles that is valid in spacetime, inde-
pendent of any reference frame, as well as a construction of
the measurement outcome in terms of spacetime invariants.
Our formalism below starts oﬀ relativistically, although we
ﬁnd that relativistic eﬀects are ignorable, and that the non-
relativistic limit completely reconstructs the eﬀect found in
Ref. [1]. We will then go back to the Lab frame, and explicitly
treat gravity as an external force ﬁeld. There, we show again
that the species separate due to diﬀerences in rest mass, rather
than due to gravity. We point out that an explicit treatment of
gravity as an external force ﬁeld oﬀer possibilities to test for
EEP violations. Note that for all calculations and results we
have set  = c = 1.

Evolution of a Composite Particle in the Lorentz Frame.– We
will ﬁrst give a frame independent quantum description of the
composite particle, then examine its evolution in a Lorentz

In our particular case, suppose that ψini(x) is spatially lo-
calized around the origin, and that the packets mainly move
along the y direction, which in turn means the m-independent
fm(k) is localized near ¯k = (0, k0, 0) (inset of Fig. 1). The
mean velocity of the m species will be vm = k0/m, and the
time it takes the center of the m packet to reach y = L is
tm ≡ L/vm = mL/k0. Inserting tm into Eq. (4), we obtain

d3x(cid:48)e− k0(x−x(cid:48))2

2iL ψini(x(cid:48)) ≡ ψﬁn(x) .

(5)

In other words, even though vm and tm are both m-dependent,
wavefunctions upon arrival at the screen are not.
In fact,
Eq. (5) is simply the Fresnel diﬀraction formula: the diﬀrac-
tion pattern on the screen depends on the initial wavefunction,
the propagation distance, and the de Brogelie wavelength,
none of which are m dependent. We assume the packet’s size
to be much less than L throughout the propagation (see Fig. 1).
Detector trajectory in a Lorentz Frame.– Having prepared a
freely propagating beam along y, we now characterize the
screen which is moving arbitrarily along z. We parametrize
the central pixel of the screen

xµ
cs = [tcs(τ), 0, L, zcs(τ)]

(6)

by its proper time τ. We denote the instantaneous 3-velocity
and Lorentz factor by β(τ) = dzcs/dtcs and γ(τ) = dtcs/dτ
respectively. The proper acceleration is given by g = γ2 ˙β. A
proper reference frame [7] can be established for the central
pixel of the screen has coordinates (τ, X, Y, Z), which maps to
Minkowski as

(cid:2)tcs(τ) + βγZ, X, Y + L, zcs(τ) + γZ(cid:3)

xµ(τ, X, Y, Z) =

(7)

Note that this only covers a region around the worldline of the
central pixel. The metric can be written as

ds2 = −(1 + gZ)2dτ2 + dX2 + dY2 + dZ2

(8)

In this coordinate system, pixels on the screen are
parametrized spatially by by (X, Z), with Y = 0 and proper
time (1 + gZ)τ.
The Measurement Process.– For each species, we measure the
number of particles captured by the screen per area over the
lifetime of the experiment. We denote this quantity by σm, and
our ﬁnal outcome σ is the sum over all species. Deﬁning ˆφm,+
and ˆφm,− as the positive and negative frequency components
of ˆφm, we ﬁrst introduce the 4-current operator

The same initial wavefunction leads to the same wavefunction on the

the packets depend on m. The inset illustrates the fact that fm(k) is
localized around ¯k. For snapshots in time, see left panels of Fig. 2.

with ωm(k) = √m2 + k2. The commutation relations between
the annihilation and creation operators are [ˆam(k), ˆa†m(cid:48)(k(cid:48))] =
δm,m(cid:48) δ3(k − k(cid:48)). A single particle state for mass m is given by

|Ψm(cid:105) =

gm(k)ˆa†m(k)|0(cid:105)

(2)

where gm transforms as a scalar between Lorentz frames, and
can be viewed as the relativistic wavefunction. Note that
while the interpretation of ˆa†m(k)|0(cid:105) as the momentum eigen-
state with eigenvalue k is only valid for a particular Lorentz
frame, ˆa(k) is a well-deﬁned operator in any frame.

When gm is limited to values of k such that |k| (cid:28) m,
the quantum state is non-relativistic. Deﬁning fm(k) =
gm(k)/√2m, we construct the time-dependent wavefunction

At t = 0, suppose we prepare a direct-product (i.e. a separa-
ble) state between the internal state and the translational mode
of the composite particle. The translational mode corresponds
to the "center of mass" degree of freedom of Ref. [1], and
they contain all the information about the particle’s location.
This means that all species share the same initial wavefunc-
tion representing its spatial distribution, or ψm(0, x) = ψini(x),
see Fig. 1, and the quantum state is prepared such that fm(k)
in Eq. (3) is m-independent. However, evolution in time will

For the spacetime volume V spanned by the proper area of a

(cid:2)0, 0, (1 + gZ)dXdZdτ, 0(cid:3), we can write Nm[V] =

To be precise, this relies on the assumption that each space-
time pixel on the screen operates independently. Because

˙σm(τ, X, Z) = (1 + gZ)(cid:104)Ψm| ˆjy

(12)

Eq. (12) has the interpretation of number of particles per

ment time, we have

dτ ˙σm(τ, X, Z)

Finally, the total count per area for mass distribution Pm is
given by

σ(X, Z) =

dm Pmσm(X, Z)

(14)

The Interference Pattern and Loss of Visibility.– We will now
make use of our simplifying assumptions and calculate ˙σm.
First, because fm(k) is localized around ¯k, we have ∂yψm ≈
ik0ψm at any given time [see Eq. (3)], and

˙σm(τ, X, Z) =vm(1 + gZ)|ψ2

m (xµ(τ, X, 0, Z))|

(15)

Using Eq. (7), we can express the Minkowski coordinates in
|ψ2
m(xµ)| explicitly in terms of (X, Z). We also change the in-
tegration variable in Eq. (13) from τ to t, which we can now
write as

σm(X, Z) = vm

(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

In the above, we’ve deﬁned ˜zcs(t) = zcs[τcs(t)], where τcs(t) is
the inverse of tcs(τ) and is the proper time of the central pixel
as a function of the Minkowski coordinate time. Then ˜zcs is an
explicit function of t that gives the central pixel’s z position in
Minkowski time.

We will now map ψm in Eq. (16) to ψﬁn, which is mass
independent. Because the packet is localized within l (cid:28) L
along y, the particle will be detectable by the screen over a
ﬁnite measurement duration, tm − l/vm < t < tm + l/vm, where
recall that tm is the mass dependent arrival time at the screen

for species m. During this time, the packet remains rigidly
1. Since the packet does not evolve
moving along y with vm
in shape as it crosses the screen, and suppressing x and z, we
can equate ψm(tm + , y) – where t varies, with ψm(tm, y − vm)
– where y varies, for || <
∼ l/vm. But ψm(tm) = ψﬁn, so we can
rewrite Eq. (16) as

(cid:90)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ2

σm(X, Z) =

dw γ

ﬁn(X, L − w, ˜zcs(tm + w/vm) + γ−1Z)
(17)

3

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Simply put, since each packet arrives on the screen at diﬀerent
moment of time, while the screen is moving, the pattern reg-
istered by the screen will be m dependent, as shown in Fig. 2.
More speciﬁcally, the screen pixel (X, Z) samples the wave
packet along a trajectory, parametrized by

[y, z] = [L − w, ˜zcs(tm + w/vm) + γ−1Z]

(18)

Note that tm and vm both depend on mass, which will lead to
a mass-dependent interference pattern, through ˜zcs. Since the
range of w is between (−l, l), then for l (cid:28) L, the diﬀerence in
w/vm caused by mass diﬀerence will be much less than that in
tm, so we can ignore w/vm in z.

So far, the screen is still relativistic (although the quan-
tum state is not). To clearly demonstrate the loss of visi-
bility, let us assume low velocities for the screen, γ ≈ 1.
Additionally, we assume separability such that ψﬁn(x, y, z) =

where α is the wavenumber of the spatial oscillation. We can

(20)

(cid:82)

σ(Z) ∝

Pm [1 + V cos[αzcs(tm) + Z]] dm

(21)

We can expand ˜zcs(tm) around t ¯m, which is the time of arrival
of the particle having average mass ¯m =
mPmdm. Using the
subscript ¯m to denote quantities of the average mass particle,
Eq. (21) becomes

σ(Z) ∝ 1 + V(cid:48) cos[α˜z ¯m + Z + φ(cid:48)]

(22)

1 Note that tm and vm each also has a range due to the mass uncertainty, al-
though those uncertainties cause only a small increase in the overall range.

this leads to ψﬁn(z) with a perfect contrast, with

V = 1 , α = k0(z1 − z2)/L

(28)

We also have ˜zcs(t) = gt2/2, ˙˜z ¯m = gt ¯m and ¨˜z ¯m = g, which, for
short time scales, leads to an integrated visibility of

V(cid:48) = 1 −

¯m/2,

(29)

For a thermal distribution of N harmonic degrees of freedom
at high temperature T, ∆m = kBT √N, and Eq. (29) becomes

(30)

which exactly reproduces Eq. (3) of Ref. [1]. For longer times,
we consider the full expression in Eq. (26), where now

δφm = gt ¯m( ¯m − m)(z2 − z1)

(31)

In the language of Ref. [1], ( ¯m − m) = ((cid:104)H0(cid:105) − H0) and g(z2 −
z1)t ¯m = ∆τ, where ∆τ is the diﬀerence in proper times between
superposed paths of the particle. Then, we obtain

eiH0∆τ(cid:69)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:68)

V(cid:48) =

(32)

which reproduces the result in Eq (4) of Ref. [1] for the double
slit system.
Origin of the loss in visibility.– While our predicted loss of
visibility in Eq’s (23) and (32) are the same as that of Ref. [1],
we interpret this eﬀect as being unrelated to gravity. The
source of dephasing is the mass dependent propagation ve-
locities, which causes the diﬀerent species to separate along
y. This separation implies that a particular pixel on the mov-
ing screen will sample the wavefunction ψﬁn(x) along mass
dependent trajectories as given by Eq. (18), eﬀectively eval-
uating ψﬁn(x) at mass dependent positions along z as shown
in Eq. (19) and in the left panels of Fig. 2. In the screen’s
own reference frame, this means that diﬀerent species land
on diﬀerent locations, the causing mass-dependent shifts of
their interference patterns along Z, by ˜zcs(tm) [Fig. 2, right
panel], which in turn smears out the pattern. In this way, the
loss of visibility is directly related to the transverse velocity
of the screen [Eq. (23)], instead of acceleration. In the situa-
tion considered by Ref. [1], gravity happens to supply such a
transverse velocity, thereby making the decrease in visibility
dependent upon the gravitational acceleration. However, if we
give the screen a uniform velocity in the Lab frame (with grav-
ity) that matches the velocity at which the packets fall in the
lab frame, there will be no loss of visibility. Vice versa, even in
absence of gravity, any motion of the screen transverse to the
beam’s propagation direction as the packets land will lead to a
loss of visibility. Ultimately, it is the mass dependence of the
de Broglie wave’s dispersion that led to wavepacket separa-
tion among diﬀerent species, and subsequently the transverse
motion of the screen that led to smearing.

spectively (separation between the packets highly exaggerated). Po-
sitions of the screen diﬀer at these moments (with central pixel la-
beled by red star), causing a shift in the interference pattern regis-
tered by the screen, which is best viewed in the central pixel’s proper
reference frame (right panel).

A Double Slit Experiment in a Uniformly Accelerating Lab.–

The loss of visibility discussed in this paper relies on the
equivalence between gravity and acceleration – hence it relies
on EEP. The explicit gravitational ﬁeld treatment above is use-
ful as a starting point for testing violations of EEP, which may
have implications in the quantum regime that cannot be tested
by classical systems, as discussed in [8] and [9]. We note that
while Eq. (33) does not assume EEP a priori, it is implicit in
the fact that the same operator ˆM appears as both inertial and
gravitational mass. A test of EEP will require modiﬁcations
to the Hamiltonian in Eq. (33).
Conclusions.– Having treated the matter-wave interferometry
thought experiment both in Lorentz Frame with accelerating
detectors and in the Lab frame with gravity, in both cases we
oﬀer the point of view that dephasing between diﬀerent in-
ternal states do not arise from gravity, but instead from the
mass dependence of the deBroglie wave’s dispersion and the
relative transverse motion of the detector. Furthermore, the
dephasing we calculate from this perspective is the same as
that predicted by Ref. [1] using their perspective of time di-
lation. We comment that the authors of Ref. [1] hold the po-
sition that the eﬀect they describe is due to time dilation, and
thus a diﬀerent eﬀect than discussed here. We note that in the
Lorentz frame, we have assumed EEP to be valid, and in the
Lab frame, EEP is already embedded in the Hamiltonian. In
order to study the implications of EEP in quantum systems
and to test for its violations in this regime, we will have to
consider a more general Hamiltonian in the Lab frame

ˆH = ˆp2/(2 ˆM) − ˆG · ˆx

(35)
where ˆG, the gravitational force, is no longer given by ˆMg. In
this case, the packets of multiple mass components will sepa-
ˆM and ˆG, and now gravity
rate due to both the spectrums of
will cause packet separation. It is also plausible that prepa-
ration of novel quantum states can reveal more structures in
the operator ˆG that could otherwise be revealed by a classical
experiment [8].

FIG. 3: Snapshots of wave packets in the the Lab frame with uniform
gravity, upon arrival of the m1 and m2 packets on the screen. Note that
the separation of packets are along the initial velocity, and gravity
does not cause separation. The packets land on diﬀerent parts of
the screen, causing the same smearing of the interference pattern as
shown on the right panel of Fig. 2.
If the screen were to drop at
the same velocity as the packets as they land, the visibility will be
recovered.

Thus, our formalism oﬀers an alternative perspective that
the loss of visibility is a is a kinematic eﬀect instead of a grav-
itational one. This becomes clear in our calculations is be-
cause we consider the full interference pattern imprinted by
each species onto the screen, from which we notice that pat-
terns are shifted along the direction of detector motion.
In
contrast, Ref. [1] considered two point quantum correlations,
which makes it diﬃcult identify this shift.
Direct calculation in gravitational ﬁeld.– That mass is the
source of dephasing instead of gravity can also be shown
when the gravitational ﬁeld is treated explicitly. Calculation
in Lorentz frame showed that the thought experiment can be
treated non-relativistically as long as the internal energy is ac-
counted for in the rest mass. Quantizing the classical Hamil-
tonian for a particle in free fall, and extending this to account
to diﬀerent mass eigenstates, we write following Hamiltonian
for multiple particle species:

ˆH = ˆp2/(2 ˆM) + ˆMg · ˆx

(33)
More speciﬁcally, we have a Hilbert space H = ⊕mHm, where
ˆM with
each Hm is the eigensubspace of the mass operator
eigenvalue m. The operators ˆx and ˆp are the position and
momentum operators in each Hm, with [ ˆM, ˆx] = [ ˆM, ˆp] =
[ ˆM, ˆH] = 0, and g is the gravitational acceleration. Heisen-
berg equations are given by ˙ˆx = ˆp/ ˆM and ˙ˆp = − ˆMg, and

ˆx(t) = ˆx0 + ˆp0t/ ˆM − gt2/2 .

(34)

In this picture, it is very clear that the separation of the pack-
ˆM, while the eﬀect of gravity is
ets is due to the spectrum of
common for all species. In our particular thought experiment,
ˆpy(0) is given an initial distribution peaked around k0, there
will be a y-direction separation of the packets, which makes
the z-patterns shift as they arrive on a screen with ﬁxed y = L
(see Fig. 3).
