Abstract

We study the partition function of the orientifold ABJM theory, which is a supercon-
formal Chern-Simons theory associated with the orthosymplectic supergroup. We ﬁnd
that the partition function associated with any orthosymplectic supergroup can be real-
ized as that of a Fermi gas system whose density matrix is identical to that associated
with the corresponding unitary supergroup with a projection to the even or odd chiral-
ity. Furthermore we propose an identity which gives directly all of the Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants for the worldsheet instanton eﬀects in the chirally projected theories.

The ABJM theory [1] provides a rigorous formulation to study the M2-brane dynamics. At the
same time, it also provides a very profound mathematical structure. In studying the partition
function or one-point functions of the BPS Wilson loop, many interesting properties were
found. Most of these properties are shared with the superconformal Chern-Simons theories
with a large number of supersymmetries N = 6 or N = 5 [2, 3].

One interesting discovery is the hidden supergroup structure [4,5]. After using the localiza-
tion techniques [6], the inﬁnite-dimensional path integral in deﬁning the partition function or
the one-point functions of the theories is reduced to a ﬁnite-dimensional multiple integration.
These matrix models take the form of the Gaussian matrix model with two simultaneous de-
formations: the supergroup deformation and the trigonometric (or hyperbolic) deformation.
For the ABJM theory we replace the U(N) gauge group of the Gaussian matrix model by
the supergroup U(N|N) and at the same time we change the rational functions by hyperbolic
functions. In terms of the hidden supergroups, other N = 6 or N = 5 superconformal theories
are associated with U(N1|N2) or OSp(N1|2N2).

Another discovery is the Fermi gas formalism, which was ﬁrst proposed in [7] for the
original U(N|N) ABJM theory. It was found that the partition function of the U(N|N + M)

The Fermi gas formalism is not only beautiful but also practical.
In fact we can follow
the systematic WKB (small k) analysis [7] to obtain the large N expansion of the partition
function. Finally, the full large N expansion was obtained [10–12], based on the analysis in the
Fermi gas formalism (small k expansion [7, 13] and exact values for ﬁnite k [14–17]) together
with the results from the ’t Hooft expansion [5, 18–21]. See [22] for a review.

After establishing the result for the unitary supergroup, it is interesting to ask what hap-
pens if we replace the unitary supergroup by an orthosymplectic supergroup, whose physical
interpretation is the introduction of an orientifold plane in the type IIB setup. It was pointed
out in [23]2 that generally in studying the theories with orthosymplectic groups the projected
density matrices introduced in [14]

[bρU(N |N +M )]± =pVM (bq)

play crucial roles, where bR is a reﬂection operator, bR|qi = | − qi. Owing to the large number
of the supersymmetries, we hope that the non-perturbative eﬀect of the orientifold plane
can be clearly identiﬁed by studying the theories with orthosymplectic supergroups. With
this expectation, recently in [25] the full large N expansion of the OSp(2N|2N) theory was
studied with the even projected density matrix and a relation to the original ABJM U(N|N)

theory was found by doubling the orthosymplectic quiver in the sense of [26]. Along these
directions, interestingly it was found [27] that the density matrix for the OSp(2N + 1|2N)
theory is identical to that for the ABJM U(N|N) theory with the odd projection

bρOSp(2N +1|2N ) =(cid:2)bρU(N |N )(cid:3)−,

which allows us to study the OSp(2N + 1|2N) theory directly from the ABJM theory. Subse-
quently this claim was generalized to the case of non-equal ranks [28]3

bρOSp(2N +2M +1|2N ) = bρOSp(2N +1|2N +2M ) =(cid:2)bρU(N |N +2M )(cid:3)−.

Related to these results, it was also observed in [29] that the values of the partition function
for the OSp(2N|2N) theory [25] match with those for the U(N|N + 1) theory with the even
projection for various integral values of k. From this we naturally expect the relation

though the proof has not been known.

bρOSp(2N |2N ) =(cid:2)bρU(N |N +1)(cid:3)+,

(1.7)

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we shall ﬁll this gap. Namely, we ﬁrst prove (1.7) by

generalizing it to

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.8)

(1.9)

with a non-negative integer M ≥ 0. It is natural to ask what happens to the case when the
rank of the orthogonal bosonic subgroup is greater than that of the symplectic subgroup. We
answer this question by proving (M ≥ 1)

3 The partition functions for the U(N1|N2) and U(N2|N1) theories are complex conjugate to each other,
while the density matrices are identical (1.1). Though, as a convention, we typically consider bρU(N1|N2) with
N2 ≥ N1, the schematic pattern may be clearer if we align the ranks of the unitary supergroups with those of
the orthosymplectic supergroups.

bρOSp(2N |2N +2M ) =(cid:2)bρU(N |N +2M +1)(cid:3)+,

bρOSp(2N +2M |2N ) =(cid:2)bρU(N |N +2M −1)(cid:3)−.

The result is schematically summarized in ﬁgure 1. Combined with the results (1.6) from [28],
we ﬁnd an interesting pattern depicted in table 1. All of these relations completely reduce the
study of the theories with orthosymplectic supergroups into that for the unitary supergroups
with chiral projections.

Table 1: Relations of the density matrices between the theory with orthosymplectic super-
groups and that with unitary supergroups.

The key observation in our proof is to utilize the extra hyperbolic sine functions (2 sinh ν

k )2
appearing in the measure of the bosonic symplectic subgroup. Although these factors were
cumbersome in the Fermi gas formalism proposed in [25], owing to this factor we can natu-
rally introduce hyperbolic tangent functions in the matrix elements, which is Fourier-dual to
hyperbolic cosecant functions [30, 31], instead of hyperbolic secant functions.

In [28] only the Fermi gas system for the density matrices with the odd projection is
assigned a physical meaning from the theories with orthosymplectic supergroups. Here we
have seen that both the odd and even chiral projections are physically relevant.

Note that the relations (1.8) and (1.9) are consistent with the duality. The duality for the

theories with orthosymplectic supergroups [3]4

OSp(2N|2N + 2M) ⇔ OSp(2N|2N + 2(k/2 − M − 1)),
OSp(2N + 2M|2N) ⇔ OSp(2N + 2(k/2 − M + 1)|2N),

(1.10)

is translated to

U(N|N + 2M + 1) ⇔ U(N|N + 2(k/2 − M − 1) + 1),

4Our convention of the level k for the orthosymplectic theories is diﬀerent from that in [3]: kABJ = khere/2.

4

U(N|N + 2M − 1) ⇔ U(N|N + 2(k/2 − M + 1) − 1),

(1.11)

which is consistent with the duality for the theories with unitary supergroups.
In [3] the
duality leads respectively to the constraint 0 ≤ M ≤ k/2 − 1 for the OSp(2N|2N + 2M)
theories and 1 ≤ M ≤ k/2 for the OSp(2N + 2M|2N) theories.5

After establishing the relation between the theories with orthosymplectic supergroups and
those with unitary supergroups with the chiral projections, in the second part we proceed to
study the instanton eﬀects [19, 32] in the chirally projected U(N|N + M) theories. First of
all we introduce the chemical potential µ dual to the particle number N and switch from the
Fermi gas partition function (1.1) to the grand potential eJ(µ) deﬁned by [7, 10]

(1.12)

e eJ(µ) =

∞XN =0

eµN(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Z(N)

Z(N = 0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = det(1 + eµbρ),

where on the right-hand side we have combined the permutations among the N integration
variables in (1.1) into the Fredholm determinant. As its periodicity in µ → µ + 2πi causes an
oscillating behavior, it is reasonable to decompose the grand potential into the non-oscillating
part J(µ) and the oscillations as

e eJ(µ) = eJ(µ)(cid:20)1 +Xn6=0

eJ(µ+2πin)−J(µ)(cid:21).

(1.13)

Hereafter the original grand potential eJ(µ) is referred to as the full grand potential while the
non-oscillating part J(µ) as the modiﬁed grand potential. The instanton eﬀects appear as
the non-perturbative eﬀects in the chemical potential O(e−µ) in the large µ expansion of the
modiﬁed grand potential J(µ).

To investigate the instanton eﬀects in the chirally projected theories, we shall consider the
two combinations Σ(µ) = J+(µ) + J−(µ) and ∆(µ) = J+(µ) − J−(µ), instead of J±(µ), the
original modiﬁed grand potentials for the even and odd projected systems. In the previous
works [25,28,29] the modiﬁed grand potentials are studied for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and M =
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and it was observed that there are two kinds of the instanton eﬀects, the worldsheet
instantons (e− 4m
k µ) and the membrane instantons (e−ℓµ) (m, ℓ ∈ N). Especially it was observed
that the anti-symmetric combination ∆(µ) contains only the membrane instantons (e−µ),
which was also studied in full detail by the WKB expansion in [29].

Our main interest in this paper is the instantons in the symmetric combination Σ(µ). This
k µ),

part contains not only the membrane instantons but also the worldsheet instantons (e− 4

5Strictly speaking, although the constraint 0 ≤ M ≤ k/2 + 1 for the OSp(2N + 2M|2N ) theories was
proposed in [3], in our analysis we ﬁnd it more natural to exclude the M = 0 case and the dual M = k/2 − 1
case in the OSp(2N + 2M|2N ) theories.

which are non-perturbative in k and thus cannot be analyzed in the WKB expansion.6 Instead,

for this part we can utilize a trivial relation among the full grand potential for bρU(N |N +M ) and
those for [bρU(N |N +M )]±

e eJ(µ) = e eJ+(µ)e eJ−(µ),

(1.14)

which is, in turn, translated to a relation among Σ(µ), ∆(µ) and the modiﬁed grand potential
of the unprojected system J(µ). Note that this relation also implies that the perturbative part
and the membrane instantons in Σ(µ) completely coincide with those in the system without
chiral projections.

In this paper we study this relation carefully. By taking the explicit results for ∆(µ) into

account, we ﬁnally identify a simple relation without the oscillatory behavior,

J(µ) = Σ(µ) + log(cid:18)1 + 2

∞Xn=1
(−1)ne

2 Σ(µ+2πin)+ 1

2 Σ(µ−2πin)−Σ(µ)(cid:19).

(1.15)

The result is derived in a similar way as for the duplicate quivers [26]. With this relation
the worldsheet instanton in Σ(µ) is completely solved in terms of the result of the ABJM
theory. Although not guaranteed from the beginning, we ﬁnd that the result ﬁt well with
the Gopakumar-Vafa formula. We have identiﬁed the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to the
seventh instanton.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we prove the relations (1.8) and
(1.9). After reducing the question for the theories with orthosymplectic supergroups into that
for the theories with unitary supergroups and the chiral projections, in section 3 we study the
grand potential for the latter theories. Finally we conclude with discussions in section 4.

2 Chiral projections

In this section, we prove that the Fermi gas system for the OSp(2N|2N + 2M) theory with
0 ≤ M ≤ k/2−1 matches with that for the U(N|N + 2M + 1) theory with the even projection,
while the Fermi gas system for the OSp(2N + 2M|2N) theory with 1 ≤ M ≤ k/2 is that for
the U(N|N +2M −1) theory with the odd projection. Namely, we study the partition function
k +ℓ)µ). It was
observed in [25,28], however, that these eﬀects are completely absorbed by the shift of the chemical potential µ
into the eﬀective chemical potential µeﬀ (3.4) which is deﬁned in the same way as in the ABJM theory without
chiral projections [17].

novelties.

To proceed, it is helpful to introduce the canonical position and momentum operators bq

After reducing the two matrix elements into the delta functions we can perform the νk
integrations by simple substitutions, leaving only a single determinant in (2.11). Reverting
it into the products (2.6) and separating the N-independent factors, we ﬁnally ﬁnd that the
partition function (2.11) is given by Z+(N) (2.1) as

so that the new contour contains the supports of the delta functions. We can show that such a deformation is
allowed if and only if M < k/2, following the argument in [28].

way we have proved that the Fermi gas system for the OSp(2N|2N + 2M) theory is identical
to that for the U(N|N + 2M + 1) theory with the even chiral projection.

2.2 Odd projection

In the previous subsection, we have seen that the density matrix for the theory with orthosym-
plectic supergroups where the rank of the bosonic symplectic subgroup is greater than or equal
to that of the orthogonal subgroup is related to that for the unitary supergroups. Here we
shall turn to the opposite case: OSp(2N + 2M|2N) with 1 ≤ M ≤ k/2.

The partition function is [6, 33]

Hence again (2.25) is nothing but the Fermi gas formalism for the U(N|N + 2M − 1) theory

3 Worldsheet instantons

In the previous section, combined with the result from [25], we have found that the matrix
model associated with any orthosymplectic supergroup is directly related to that associated

11

with the corresponding unitary supergroup and the chiral projection. This means that we
can study the OSp(N1|2N2) theories with completely general (N1, N2) from the U(N|N + M)
theories with the chiral projections.

Here we proceed to study the grand potentials for the latter theories. First we deﬁne the

following symmetric and anti-symmetric combination

Σ(µ) = J+(µ) + J−(µ), ∆(µ) = J+(µ) − J−(µ),

(3.1)

where J±(µ) are respectively the modiﬁed grand potential for the density matrix [bρU(N |N +M )]±.

The large µ expansion of Σ(µ) and ∆(µ) was studied previously in [28, 29], and was observed
to have the following structures

membrane instantons e−( 4m
k +ℓ)µ are observed to be absorbed into the worldsheet instantons
e− 4m
k µeﬀ through the non-perturbative deviations in µeﬀ (3.4). Note that Σ(µ) and the modiﬁed
grand potential without chiral projections J(µ) have the same schematic structure: they have
completely the same perturbative part and the membrane instantons; they are diﬀerent only
in the coeﬃcients of the worldsheet instantons. Several coeﬃcients of the half membrane
instantons rℓ (1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 7) in ∆(µ) are determined as explicit functions of (k, M) through the
extrapolation of the WKB small k expansion in [29].

Below we shall study the worldsheet instantons in the symmetric combination Σ(µ). With
the help of the schematic expression (3.2) of the anti-symmetric part ∆(µ), we extract from
(1.14) a new relation (1.15) between Σ(µ) and J(µ). Using it we further compute the explicit
expression of the ﬁrst few instanton coeﬃcients and ﬁnd that they ﬁt with the Gopakumar-
Vafa formula of the topological string theory, with the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants identiﬁed
as in tables 2, 3 and 4.

3.1 Worldsheet instantons for chiral projections

From the fundamental properties of the projection operators bΠ+ +bΠ− = 1 and bΠ+bΠ− = 0, it

follows that

det(1 + eµbρU(N |N +M )) = det(1 + eµ[bρU(N |N +M )]+) det(1 + eµ[bρU(N |N +M )]−).

This is translated into the relations among the full grand potentials (1.14) or

Xn∈Z

eJ(µ+2πin) = Xn+∈Z

eJ+(µ+2πin+) Xn−∈Z

eJ−(µ+2πin−).

(3.5)

(3.6)

At ﬁrst sight it seems diﬃcult to extract a relation between the modiﬁed grand potentials
as the equation contains the oscillating terms both for J(µ) and J±(µ). As we see below,
however, using the schematic expression of the anti-symmetric part ∆(µ) (3.2) we obtain a
more reﬁned relation (1.15) where the oscillations for J(µ) are absent.

We rewrite the relation (3.6) in terms of Σ(µ) and ∆(µ)

Xn∈Z

eJ(µ+2πin) = Xn+∈Z

Σ+∆

2

e

(µ+2πin+) Xn−∈Z

Σ−∆

2

e

(µ+2πin−).

As ∆(µ) in (3.2) has the following simple quasi-periodicity

∆(µ + 2πin) = ∆(µ) + πin,

the relation reduces to

Xn∈Z

eJ(µ+2πin) = Xn+∈Z Xn−∈Z

in+−n−e(Σ(µ+2πin+)+Σ(µ+2πin−))/2.

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

Here we notice that the terms with odd n+ − n− do not contribute, since each of those terms
is always accompanied with the one with the opposite sign

in+−n−e

2 Σ(µ+2πin+)+ 1

2 Σ(µ+2πin−) + in−−n+e

1

2 Σ(µ+2πin−)+ 1

2 Σ(µ+2πin+) = 0.

Then, (3.6) can be rewritten as

Xn∈Z

eJ(µ+2πin) = Xn+−n−∈2Z

(−1)

This relation can be solved by

which can be rewritten as (1.15). As in [26] we can easily check that (3.12) correctly reproduces
(3.11) and contains no oscillations.

13

3.2 Gopakumar-Vafa invariants

To obtain the direct relation between the worldsheet instantons in Σ(µ) and those in J(µ),
let us compute the exponent inside the logarithm in (1.15) using the schematic expression of
Σ(µ) (3.2). Most of the contributions including the non-perturbative membrane instantons
cancel and we are left with the C term and the worldsheet instantons as

Then, we ﬁnd that the functional form of sm reproduces all the numerical ﬁtting in [28, 29].

where we have written the arguments (k, M) to express the multi-covering structure of the

invariants nd
g , as the original modiﬁed grand potentials J±(µ) associated to the density matrices

[bρU(N |N +M )]± are related to Σ(µ) and ∆(µ) as J±(µ) = (Σ(µ) ± ∆(µ))/2.
For the ABJM (N1 = N2) case, the diagonal Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of J±(µeﬀ) =
(Σ(µeﬀ)± ∆(µeﬀ))/2 is given in table 2. This matches with the results for d = 1, 2, 3, 4 in [28].
We can perform a similar analysis for the non-diagonal case N1 6= N2. The summary of the
results is given in tables 3 and 4.

4 Conclusion and discussion

In this paper we have proved that the density matrix of the theories with orthosymplectic
supergroups reduces to that of the theories with unitary supergroups and the chiral projections.
We have further established the identity between the total grand potential J(µ) and the sum
of the projected ones Σ(µ). From this identity we can derive Gopakumar-Vafa invariants
systematically without mentioning to the numerical ﬁtting, as long as we know those for the
theories with unitary supergroups.

Let us raise several questions related to our results and discuss some further directions.

Firstly, though we have found the equivalences between the chiral projections of the
U(N|N + M) theories and the theories with the orthosymplectic groups, the counterpart

of the U(N|N + 2M)+ theory is still missing (see table 1). It is then interesting to ask the
role of this sector in the context of the orientifold background.

Secondly, we shall argue possible extension of our computations. We have introduced the
states |m]], |m)) in section 2 and |mii in [28]. It is interesting to note that these combinations
appear naturally in the Weyl character formulas for Sp(2N), O(2N) and O(2N +1) respectively
(see e.g. [34]). Apparently, this interpretation is a good sign for generalizations of our results
on partition functions into one-point functions of the BPS Wilson loops [10, 35]. It is also
interesting to study the non-perturbative eﬀects of the orientifold plane for other exactly
solvable Chern-Simons theories like the (2, 2)k model [36, 37].

Finally let us discuss the BPS index. In general the worldsheet instantons are changed
drastically, while the membrane instantons remain unmodiﬁed. This indicates that, if we
assume the same reﬁned topological string expression as in the ABJM theory [12], the BPS
index is reshuﬄed with the membrane instantons kept ﬁxed. For example, for (d1, d2) = (1, 1),
the only non-vanishing BPS index in the ABJM theory is N (1,1)
= 1. In the orientifold theory,
0, 3
2
if we make an ansatz that only the BPS indices for 0 ≤ jL ≤ 1/2 and 0 ≤ jL + jR ≤ 3/2 are
non-vanishing from the expression of the instantons, we ﬁnd non-trivial relations

9 In studying the ABJM partition function on an ellipsoid, it was found [38] that the BPS index is changed
from that of the local P1 × P1 geometry to that of local P2 when moving the ellipsoid deformation parameter
from b = 1 to b = √3. The change of the BPS indices may be similar to our situation.
