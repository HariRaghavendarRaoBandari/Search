Nonlocal gravity has been shown to provide a phenomenologically viable infrared modiﬁcation of
general relativity. A natural question is whether the required nonlocality can emerge from pertur-
bative quantum loop corrections due to light particles. We show that this is not the case. For the
value of the mass scale of the non-local models required by cosmology, the perturbative form factors
obtained from the loop corrections, in the present cosmological epoch, are in the regime where they
are local. The mechanism behind the generation of the required nonlocality must be more complex,
possibly related to strong infrared eﬀects and non-perturbative mass generation for the conformal
mode.

1. Introduction. In the last few years, together with
various collaborators, we have proposed and developed a
class of non-local infrared (IR) modiﬁcations of general
relativity, which appear to have quite interesting cosmo-
logical consequences. The ﬁrst successful model of this
type was proposed in [1] (see also [2–6] for earlier related
ideas), and is deﬁned by the non-local equation of motion

Gµν −

(1)

where the superscript T denotes the operation of taking
the transverse part of a tensor (which is itself a non-local
operation). The mass m is a free parameter of the model,
which replaces the cosmological constant in ΛCDM. A
closed form of the action of this model is not currently
known. A related model, deﬁned at the level of the ac-
tion, was introduced in [7], and is deﬁned by

(2)

where m2
Pl = 1/(8πG). Both models, that we referred
to as the RT and RR model, respectively, have a viable
background evolution at the cosmological level display-
ing self-acceleration, i.e. the nonlocal term behaves as
an eﬀective dark energy density [1, 7, 8]. Their cos-
mological perturbations are well behaved [9, 10] and ﬁt
well CMB, supernovae, BAO and structure formation
data [9, 11, 12]. The cosmological perturbations have
then been implemented in a Boltzmann code in [13, 14].
This allowed us to perform Bayesian parameter estima-
tion and a detailed quantitative comparison with ΛCDM.
The result is that the RT model (1) ﬁts the data at a
level which is statistically indistinguishable from ΛCDM.
In contrast, using the Planck 2015 data and an extended
set of BAO observations, we found in [14] that the RR
model (2), even if by itself ﬁts the data at a fully accept-
able level, in a Bayesian model comparison with ΛCDM
or with the RT model is disfavored. The RT model can
be considered as a nonlinear extension of the RR model,
since the two models become the same when linearized
over Minkowski space, so we expect that its action would
contain further non-linear terms with respect to the sim-
pler action of the RR model. Since the observational data

point toward the importance of these nonlinear term, in
[15] we have explored some other non-linear extension
of the action (2), suggested by conformal symmetry. In
particular, we found that the model deﬁned by the action

appears to work quite well [see also [16] for a study with
the more general operator (−✷ + ξR)−2]. Even if a full
analysis of its cosmological perturbations has not yet
been performed, from the equation of state of the ef-
fective dark energy we expect that its predictions will
deviate from that of ΛCDM less than the predictions of
the RT model (which in turn is closer to ΛCDM than
the RR model), and therefore will be consistent with the
data (and possibly diﬃcult to distinguish from ΛCDM).
Another interesting aspect of these models is that they
can be nicely connected with the Starobinsky inﬂation-
ary model, providing a simple model that describes both
inﬂation in the early Universe and dark energy at late
times. A uniﬁed model of this type has been ﬁrst pro-
posed in [17] (see also [18][15][19]), where we suggested to
unify the model (2) with the Starobinsky model, through
an action of the form

also for the model (3), considering the action [15]

or for the RT model, combining the non-local contribu-
tion in eq. (1) with the contribution to the equations
of motion coming from the R2 term in the Starobinski
model. As discussed in [15], at early times the non-local
term is irrelevant and we recover the standard inﬂation-
ary evolution, while at late times the local R2 term be-
comes irrelevant and we recover the evolution of the non-
local models. This has also been recently conﬁrmed in

[19], through the explicit numerical integration of the
equations of motion. Further work on these nonlocal
models has been presented in [20–27].

2. Perturbative loop corrections. Given that these non-
local models are phenomenologically successful, the next
question is whether nonlocalities of this form can emerge,
at an eﬀective level, from a fundamental local QFT. In
general, loops of massless or light particles induce nonlo-
cal terms in the quantum eﬀective action, so it is natural
to ask whether such perturbative corrections can gen-
erate a nonlocal term such as that in eq. (2), or in its
non-linear generalizations (1) or (3). In gravity the one-
loop corrections induced by matter ﬁelds indeed produce
nonlocal form factors associated to terms quadratic in
the curvature, which have been computed in several clas-
sic papers using diagrammatic or heat-kernel techniques
[28–33] (see also [34–36] for textbooks or reviews). The
resulting quantum eﬀective action has the general form

S = Z d4x√−g(cid:20) m2

Pl
2

R − R kR(✷)R

(6)

−CµνρσkW (✷)Cµνρσ(cid:21) ,

where Cµνρσ is the Weyl tensor, and we used as a basis
for the quadratic term R2, CµνρσCµνρσ and the Gauss-
Bonnet term, that we have not written explicitly. For
massless particles, the form factors kR(✷) and kW (✷)
only contain logarithmic terms plus ﬁnite parts,
i.e.
kR,W (✷) = cR,W log(✷/µ2), where ✷ is the generally-
covariant d’Alembertian, µ the renormalization point,
and cR, cW are coeﬃcients that depend on the number of
matter species and on their spin. The form factors gen-
erated by loops of a massive particle with mass M are
more complicated. In the UV limit, i.e. at energies or
curvatures such that M 2/✷ can be treated as small, the
form factors have an expansion of the general form

kR(cid:18)−✷

M 2(cid:19) = α log(cid:18)−✷

+ . . . ,

[and similarly for kW (−✷/M 2)], as discussed for instance
in [37] using a covariant generalization of the EFT for-
malism of [38].
In [18] it was then observed that the
logarithmic term, as well as the term (M 2/✷), have lit-
tle eﬀect on the cosmological evolution in the present
epoch. This might leave as a dominant contribution the
one due to (M 2/✷)2 which, as we know from [7], gener-
ates a phase of accelerated expansion in the recent epoch.
In [18] it was then concluded that a non-local model such
as (2) emerges naturally from the perturbative loop cor-
rections.

The purpose of this short note is to point out that,
unfortunately, this is not the case, and the mechanism
that generates these nonlocal cosmological models must

2

be more complicated. The crucial point is that the ex-
pansion (7) only holds in the UV limit, where the oper-
ator M 2/✷ can be treated as small. In a cosmological
context, this means that M 2/H 2 ≪ 1, where H(t) is the
Hubble parameter.1
To understand when this condition is satisﬁed, we ob-

serve that we can rewrite eq. (2) as

SRR = Z d4x√−g (cid:20) 1

where

(9)

To obtain a viable cosmological evolution, with an ac-
celerated expansion in the present epoch, we need m =
O(H0), where H0 is the present value of the Hubble pa-
rameter. This result was obtained in [1, 7, 8] from the
explicit integration of the equations of motion, but of
course the order of magnitude follows from simple di-
mensional considerations. The non-local term in eq. (2)
is suppressed, with respect to the Einstein-Hilbert term,
by a factor of order (m2/✷2)R. In FRW, after radiation
dominance, R ∼ H 2 and 1/✷ ∼ 1/H 2, so (m2/✷2)R ∼
m2/H 2.
If we want that the non-local term becomes
comparable to the Einstein-Hilbert term near the present
epoch, we therefore need m ∼ H0. Setting m ∼ H0,
eq. (9) gives (apart from numerical factors of order one)

M ≃ (mPlH0)1/2 ,

(10)

which is huge compared to H0.
Indeed, numerically
eq. (10) gives M = O(10−3) eV, while H0 = O(10−33) eV.
This means that, for such a value of M , the UV expan-
sion (7) is not valid near the present epoch, where we
are rather in the opposite regime, M 2 ≫ −✷. The UV
expansion is only valid for M 2/H 2(t) ≪ 1 which, for the
value of M given by eq. (10), in terms of redshift means
z ≫ 1015. The expansion (7) is therefore meaningful only
in the very early Universe.
In the opposite (IR) limit M 2 ≫ −✷, a particle with
mass M is actually heavy compared to the relevant cur-
vature scale and it decouples, leaving only a local contri-
bution. As an explicit example, for a massive scalar ﬁeld
with action

the form factors kR(−✷/M 2) and kW (−✷/M 2) in eq. (6)
were computed in [32, 33] in closed form, for −✷/M 2

1 More precisely ✷−1 is a nonlocal operator, which depends on
the whole past history. However, from the time evolution of
the auxiliary ﬁelds U = −✷−1R and V = H 2
✷−2R shown for
instance in Fig. 1 of [9] we see that, up to the present epoch,
the estimate ✷−1 ∼ 1/H 2(t) is correct, up to a factor at most
O(10), which will be irrelevant for the considerations below.

In the UV limit one recovers the expansion (7). However,
in the opposite limit −✷/M 2 ≪ 1 one ﬁnds
kW (✷), kR(✷) = O(✷/M 2) .

(15)

Therefore in this limit the form factor is local, and small,
corresponding to the decoupling of particles with mass
large compared to the momentum scale, which is explicit
in the mass-dependent subtraction scheme used in [32,
33] (see also the discussion in sect. 2.3.1 of [17]).

In conclusion, a particle with a mass M ∼ 10−3 eV
(such as a neutrino), naively seems to give a contribution
to the term (M 2/✷)2 in eq. (7), of the right order of mag-
nitude for reproducing the model (2) with m ∼ H0, as
required by cosmology. However, for such a particle the
expansion (7) is invalid near the present epoch. A neu-
trino is actually an extremely heavy particle compared to
the scale H0, and today it gives a local contribution of the
form (15), suppressed by a factor O(✷/M 2) ≪ 1. A non-
local contributions proportional to M 4/✷2 at the present
epoch could only be obtained from hypothetical massive

particles with a mass M <∼ H0 ∼ O(10−33) eV. However,
according to eq. (9), this would produce a nonlocal term
in eq. (2) with a totally negligible value m ∼ H 2
0 /mPl,
rather than m ∼ H0.
It should also be observed that, at the level of terms
quadratic in the curvature, logarithmic corrections in-
volving graviton loops are not even well deﬁned, since
they depend on the gauge used, and one can even ﬁnd
gauges in which the corresponding divergences are ab-
sent, so that the theory is one-loop ﬁnite even oﬀ-
shell [39]. A related issue is that the particle creation
due to these terms is a pure quantum noise, and the real
eﬀect of particle production only starts from terms of
third order in the curvature [40].2

3. Strong-coupling eﬀects in the IR? The above con-
siderations stimulated us in [17] to look for less obvi-
ous mechanisms for the generation of the required non-
localities. A possibility which is rather intriguing is that

2 For this reason, it is interesting to study also the cosmological
eﬀects induced by nonlocal terms cubic in the curvature. In [41]
has indeed been studied the eﬀect of adding to the Einstein-
Hilbert action a term R2✷−2R, or a term R(✷−1R)2. In both
cases, however, no viable cosmological model emerges, already
at the background level, see Sect. 4 of [41].

the scale M that appears in eq. (8), rather than being
identiﬁed with the mass of a particle running in quantum
loops (which, as we have seen, is not a viable possibility)
is actually generated dynamically by strong coupling ef-
fects, much as ΛQCD in QCD. To stress this diﬀerent
interpretation, in [17] we have indeed denoted the mass
scale M as ΛRR. The idea of strong coupling eﬀects in
gravity in the far infrared might seem diﬃcult to im-
plement. However, as discussed in [17], one can imag-
ine mechanisms that leads to strong IR eﬀects in GR.
One possibility is related to the running of the coupling
constant associated to the R2 term.
If the running is
such that the coupling is asymptotically free in the UV
and grows in the IR, a strong coupling regime could be
reached at cosmological distances.

Another interesting possibility, again discussed in [17],
is that the dynamics of the conformal mode could become
strongly coupled at large distances. Indeed, restricting to
the dynamics of the conformal mode σ, i.e. writing the
metric as

gµν(x) = e2σ(x)ηµν ,

(16)

the quantum loops corrections embodied in the anomaly-
induced eﬀective action generate a non-trivial kinetic
term for the conformal mode [42, 43],

Sanom = −

Q2

16π2 Z d4x (✷σ)2 ,

(17)

where Q depends on the number and type of conformal
massless ﬁelds. Thus the conformal mode, which in clas-
sical GR is a constrained ﬁeld, acquires a propagator
∝ 1/k4 because of quantum eﬀects. The corresponding
propagator in coordinate space grows logarithmically,

G(x, x′) = −(2Q2)−1 log[µ2(x − x′)2] .

(18)

This growth of the two-point correlation at large dis-
tances could in principle generate strong IR eﬀects. The
situation is quite similar to what happens in two dimen-
sions, where a momentum-space propagator ∝ 1/k2 again
generates a logarithmically growing propagator in coor-
dinate space, often resulting in a rich infrared physics.
A classic example is the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) phase transition where, changing the value of the
parameter Q2 in front of the propagator, a system can
make a phase transition from an ordered phase to a disor-
dered phase, with generation of a mass gap. As discussed
in [17], a non-local term of the form R✷−2R (or its non-
linear generalizations) indeed describes a mass for the
conformal mode. Indeed, in the metric (16) we have

R = −6✷σ + O(σ2) ,

and therefore, upon integration by parts,

m2R

1
✷2 R = 36m2σ2 + O(σ3) .

(19)

(20)

The non local term m2R✷−2R therefore provides a
diﬀeomorphism-invariant way of giving a mass to the con-
formal mode. A mechanism of dynamical mass genera-
tion for the conformal mode would therefore naturally
produce a term m2R✷−2R, or one of its non-linear gen-

eralizations such as those in eqs. (1) or (3).
