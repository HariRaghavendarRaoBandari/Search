We study the environment assisted local transitionless dynamics in closed spin systems driven
through quantum critical points. In general shortcut to adaiabaticity (STA) in quantum critical
systems requires highly non-local control Hamiltonians. In this work we develop an approach to
achieve local shortcuts to adiabaticity (LSTA) in spin chains, using local control ﬁelds which scale
polynomially with the system size, following universal critical exponents. We relate the control ﬁelds
to reduced ﬁdelity susceptibility and use transverse Ising model in one dimension to exemplify our
generic results. We also extend our analysis to achieve LSTA in central spin models.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems
is currently very intensively investigated as it is at the
heart of the understanding of many fundamental prob-
lems in modern science [1, 2] as well central for emerging
quantum technologies [3]. In several important cases it is
of great importance to be able to have means to control
the dynamics of these complex systems. This is for exam-
ple the case of the preparation of of certain desired many-
body states. To this aim optimal control techniques have
been specially devised for many-body systems [4, 5] and
successfully implemented experimentally [6–8]. Optimal
control of many-body systems have proven to be helpful
also in reducing the formations of defect on traversing a
critical point [9] as well as in cooling [10], just to mention
some examples.

Among the various way to engineer the dynamics of
a quantum system the so called shortcuts to adiabat-
icy (see [11] for a review of the ﬁeld) are attracting
an increasing attention. By judicious choice of time-
dependent contributions to the Hamiltonian, shortcuts to
adiabaticity (STA) allows for a truly adiabatic evolution
at a ﬁnite speed. A quantum system prepared initially in
a given eigenstate of an Hamiltonian Hf ree can remain
in the corresponding instantaneous eigenstate of Hf ree(t)
on adding a specially designed term Hc(t) to the Hamil-
tonian governing the evolution of the system [12, 13]. De-
veloping diﬀerent protocols for achieving STA has been
the focus of several studies, for example the application
of counter-adiabatic terms [12–14], the fast forward ap-
proach [15] to name a few together with its application to
two and three level atoms [16]. STA was also extended to
the case of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [17], and to open
quantum systems governed by a Lindblad dynamics [18].
The theoretical eﬀorts have been complemented by ex-
perimental implementation of STA protocols [19, 20].

Shortcut to adiabaticity was also extended to con-
trol the dynamics of many-body system governed by
the transverse Ising [21] and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick [22]

Hamiltonians. A distinct feature emerging from these
works is the increasing complexity of the Hamiltonian
Hc as a result of gaps closing in the spectrum. Suppose
to apply STA to a system initially prepared in the ground
state of a spin system. The correction Hc to be imple-
mented will contain multi-spin interaction which become
progressively important when Hf ree is close to a critical
point (where the gap closes) [21]. This eﬀect is intimately
related to the so called Kibble-Zurek mechanism [23, 24].
In general, a system starting from an initial ground state
evolves adiabatically and always remains in its instanta-
neous ground state, when it is in presence of a Hamilto-
nian changing suﬃciently slowly in time. However, when
a parameter of the Hamiltonian is changed across its criti-
cal value at an arbitrary rate τ −1, the energy gap between
the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state vanishes. This
results in breakdown of the adiabatic theorem of quan-
tum mechanics near the the critical point thus invariably
resulting in non-adiabatic excitations, which vanish only
in the ideal, and experimentally unachievable, limit of
τ → ∞ [23, 24]. It is possible to cross a critical point
without defect generation either by optimal control [8, 9]
or by means of STA [21, 22]. In both cases, in diﬀerent
ways, the existence of the critical point manifest in the
need of an increasing complex control protocol.

So far STA was deﬁned as to have the system in the in-
stantaneous eigenstate with unit ﬁdelity. For many-body
system it is however meaningful to relax this requirement
and construct a LSTA protocol so to have strict adia-
baticity guaranteed only in a subsystems of an extended
system. The LSTA might be applied while manipulat-
ing qubits trapped in N-V centres or atoms trapped in
optical lattices where, e.g., one might be interested in
preparing only the center of the trap with less excitation
as possible [25–27].

The question can be formulated as follows. The goal is
to ﬁnd a correction term Hc such that the all the local ob-
servables (deﬁned within a given length LST A of the total
system) coincide with those calculated with the instanta-
neous ground state. The state does not need to be close

to the eigenstate, only the reduced density matrices (in
the region LST A) should coincide. In this work we deal
with LSTA by application of local control Hamiltonians
only. Our analysis aims at engineering environment as-
sisted adiabatic dynamics in subsystems, whose size can
range from a single qubit to half of the total system, by
application of local control Hamiltonians. To this aim we
consider a generic spin system driven through a quantum
critical point (QCP) at a ﬁnite rate. We achieve LSTA
in a single spin (shown in red in Fig. (1a)) by applica-
tion of control ﬁelds acting on this spin under considera-
tion, in addition to an interaction with a nearest neigh-
bor auxiliary spin (shown in blue in Fig. (1a)). Further,
we present the possibility of applying the same control
Hamiltonian Hc(t) at multiple sites to achieve STA in
up to half of the spin system (Fig. (1b)). Our analysis
points towards generic polynomial scaling relations fol-
lowed by the control ﬁelds, which again can be related
to reduced ﬁdelity susceptibility of the system. We have
also extended our analysis to LSTA in quantum critical
Hamiltonians which include long range interaction terms.
In particular, we focus on a central spin model where the
central spin is coupled uniformly to all spins of its envi-
ronmental spin chain (see Fig. (1c)). Analogous to the
previous case, we develop mechanisms to achieve LSTA
using local ﬁelds which follow generic scaling relations
with the size of the environment.

The paper is organized as follows: We focus on local
STA in a free Fermionic spin model in section II A; here
we present control schemes and derive scaling relations
followed by the control ﬁelds. In section II B, we verify
our generic results using the speciﬁc case of a one dimen-
sional spin 1/2 Ising model in presence of a transverse
ﬁeld and show that LSTA in this case is possible by ap-
plication of local ﬁelds which scale logarithmically with
the system size. We extend our analysis of local STA
to systems subjected to long-range interactions in sec-
tion III A, where we focus on transitionless driving in a
generic central spin model. Once more, we exemplify our
results using a transverse Ising spin chain environment
in section III B. Finally we conclude in section IV.

citations for any ﬁnite rate of driving. This eventually
changes the reduced single site density matrix ρ1(t) from
its instantaneous “ground state form” G(t), the single site
density matrix obtained for perfect adiabatic evolution of
the whole spin system.

We consider the spin model with a local control Hamil-

ces. We assume our spin system (1) can be mapped to a

(3)

applied in addition to the original free Fermionic Hamil-
tonian Hf ree(t) near the QCP. We note that the dynam-
ics is adiabatic for almost the entire length of time away
from the QCP, when ρ1(t) ≈ G(t) even in absence of any
control ﬁeld. In contrast, the ﬁelds hz(t) and ∆y(t) con-
trol the phase and energy level populations of the spin
respectively near the QCP, whereas we control the purity
of the spin s by tuning its interaction strength J(t) with
a nearest neighbor spin s + 1. One can expect the control

ﬁelds (3) to depend on the the single site reduced ﬁdelity
susceptibility χs, which quantiﬁes the rate of change of
G as a function of the system parameters. As shown in
some related works, χs as well as the response time of
the system can be expected to diverge with the system
size near the QCP [29–33].

As we will show later, for small dimensions, the con-
trol ﬁeld strength should diverge at the QCP, similar to
the response time and χs, given the diverging correlation
length in the system. Thus we can neglect the eﬀects of
Hf ree(t) on the two spins under consideration in compar-
ison to that of the diverging control ﬁelds near the QCP,
and approximate the dynamics of the two spin (s, s + 1)
density matrix ρ2 by

∂ρ2(t)

∂t ≈ −i [Hc(t), ρ2(t)] .
Finally, after using Eqs. (3) and (4), tracing out the
auxiliary spin and imposing the condition ρ1(t) = G(t)
near the QCP, one gets

(4)

∆y(t) =

(5)

Further, one has G(1, 1) = (1 + hσziG) /2, and G(1, 2) =
hσ−iG, where the single site expectation values are calcu-
lated in the ground state of the spin system. It is possible
to obtain a generic scaling relation for ∆y by restricting
ourselves to the case

G(1, 1) =

where L is the length of the system and Gk(t) denotes

stantaneous ground state of K(t) (see eq.
above assumption (6) is valid in translationally invariant
spin chains, including the transverse Ising model and XY
model, where the total number of up spins correspond to
the total number of Fermions present in an equivalent
free Fermionic picture. Following the above arguments,
one ﬁnally arrives at the scaling forms

(7)

where ν and z are respectively the correlation length and
correlation time exponents near a QCP (with νz = 1),
and the constant of proportionality depends on the de-
tailed form of ~ak. Note that ∆y ∼ ln L at the QCP for
z = d and the approximation (4) might not be valid for
z < d when ∂G(1, 1)/∂t, and hence ∆y, fail to diverge
near the QCP. In case of G(1, 2) = hσ−iG = 0, which
can arise due to symmetries in the model, we replace
Re [G(1, 2)] with a small inﬁdelity parameter ǫ in Eq. (7)
in order to have a ﬁnite ∆y. Additionally, one can solve
for hz(t) and J(t) as well using Eq. (4), which needs de-
tailed knowledge about the system. However, they can

3

be expected to diverge with system size near the QCP as
well; as shown below for the transverse ﬁeld Ising model.
Furthermore, one may apply the same control Hamil-
tonian in multiple sites in order to achieve macroscopic
adiabatic passage through QCP for up to L/2 spins lo-
cated in the even or odd sublattice (assuming L even). To
this end we apply a simple additive control Hamiltonian
of the form

L/2

Hc,L(t) =

Xj=0(cid:2)hz(t)σz

2j − ∆y(t)σy

2j + J(t)σz

2j σz

2j+1(cid:3) , (8)

where we have assumed periodic boundary condition. As
seen from Eq. (8), the control Hamiltonian Hc,L(t) cou-
ples all the even spins with their nearest neighbors and
allows us to generate local adiabatic passage through the
QCP for half of the spin chain without the need of intro-
ducing highly non-local ﬁelds, even though the correla-
tion length diverges near the QCP. The above Eqs. (5)
- (8) are the main results of our paper and they clearly
show the possibility of engineering LSTA through a quan-
tum critical point by application of local ﬁelds and local
interactions only.

Interestingly, as mentioned above one can arrive at an

estimate of ∆y from χs. One has

∂λ (cid:19)2
χ0 ∼ (cid:18) ∂G(1, 1)
near a QCP, where we have assumed ∂G(j, j)/∂t ≫
∂G(i, j)/∂t (i 6= j), which is indeed the case if hσ±iG = 0
[30, 31]. The above arguments ﬁnally give us

We note that following the technique introduced above,
shortcut to adiabaticity in systems of arbitrary size, as
compared to singe qubits considered here, might require
an environment, formed by auxiliary spins, which is at
least as large as the system itself, as suggested by a re-
cent work on puriﬁcation of open quantum systems [34].
However, an exact analysis is beyond the scope of our
present work.

B.

Ising model in presence of a transverse ﬁeld

Let us now elucidate the generic results obtained above
using the exactly solvable example a spin 1/2 transverse
Ising model in one dimension, represented by the Hamil-
tonian

f ree = t/τ , −T < t < T for some arbi-
trary T ≫ τ > 0. The above model (11) has QCPs at
f ree = ˆBz
Bz
f ree = ±1, and can be decoupled into inde-
pendent two level systems characterized by their corre-
sponding momentum k modes (as in Eq. (2)) [28, 35–37].

(11)

We start with an initial spin up paramagnetic ground
state at t = −T . The oﬀ-diagonal terms of the coarse
grained single site density matrix ρ1(t) vanish due to de-
coherence, while G(1, 2) = 0 for all t due to symmetry
of the Hamiltonian (11) [38]. On the other hand, one
can show that in the absence of any control the diagonal
elements evolve very slowly with time far away from the
QCP (when |Bz
f ree| ≫ 1), as well as near the QCP, as a
signature of critical slowing down.

as quantiﬁed by the inﬁdelity (cid:16)1 − trp√Gρ1√G(cid:17) (see

Fig. (2) and Appendix). Clearly, this conforms to our
general scaling relations for the transverse Ising model
with z = d = 1 (see Eq. (7)). We note that keeping

thus eﬀectively linearly scaling the error to xǫ, thereby
showing the robustness of our protocol. Further, numer-
ical analysis of the von-Neumann equation (4) for the
single site reduced density matrix shows |J|,|hz| increase
with increasing L at the QCP (see ﬁgs.
(3), (4) and
Appendix). It is worthwhile to note that the reduced ﬁ-
delity susceptibility χ1 of a single spin in the transverse
Ising model scales as (lnL)2 at the QCP, thus once more
verifying our general scaling relation (see Eq. (10))

trast, we extend our analysis to a central spin (CS) model
where a single central spin s interacts uniformly with all
spins of an environmental spin chain E (see Fig. (1c)).
The CS model has been investigated extensively in a se-
ries of works in the recent past in problems related to
decoherence, Lochsmidt echo, non-markovianity of baths
to name a few [39–42]. Such a system can be represented
by the Hamiltonian
H cs
f ree = H0 + λVλ + r| ↑issh↑ |Vλ + Bz
Here H0 is the critical Hamiltonian of the environmental
spin chain and as before, λ denotes the deviation from
the QCP (λ = 0). Vλ is an operator acting on the en-
vironment. The term r| ↑issh↑ |Vλ is responsible for the
global coupling between s and E, where we have assumed
the coupling exists only if s is in the | ↑is state. The
composite system starts from an initial product state at
t = −T , with the spin s being in its local ground state
|si(t = −T ) = | ↑i with respect to the time dependent
local ﬁeld Bz
f ree,s(t = −T ) < 0 and the environment
spin chain is the ground state |EGi of the Hamiltonian
f ree,s = 0. We assume Bz
(16) with Bz
f ree,s(t) changes
sign at t = 0, at which point s stops being in its lo-
cal ground state. Naturally, transitionless driving in this

case would correspond to ﬂipping the CS to |si = | ↓i
at t = 0+, thereby keeping it in its instantaneous ground
state at all times. For a product initial state of the form
|ψi = (c+| ↑i + c−| ↓i) ⊗ |EGi, the reduced density ma-
trix of the CS evolves as [40]

In this case ν = z = d = 1, and α scales linearly with L
[41]. Therefore proceeding as before for the generic case
and demanding LSTA in the central spin, one arrives at
the scaling relation

πrL1/2

.

(21)

|∆cs| ≫
The above relation agrees with the general scaling rela-
tions presented in section (III A) and once again shows
the possibility of achieving LSTA even in presence of non-
local interactions.
Interestingly, we reach this goal by
application of control ﬁelds which scale sub-extensively
with system size.

Following some related works which have focused on
central spin model with two central spins interacting with
a spin chain environment, we now extend our analysis to
two central spins s1 and s2, described by the Hamiltonian
[43]

|f (δt)|2 ≈ exp(cid:2)−α(δt)2(cid:3)
α ∼ r2L2(1/ν−z)
∼ r2λ2(νz−1)

if λ ≪ L−1/ν
if λ ≪ L−1/ν

However, the above scaling relations are valid as long
2/ν − 2z > d. Otherwise in higher dimensional systems
the contribution coming from the low energy modes be-
come subleading, and we get α ∼ Ld. The decay of f is
responsible for the decrease in purity of s for c+, c− 6= 0.
Clearly, one needs to ﬂip s in a time δt << 1/√α to
ensure that the spin does not lose its purity during the
process. This requires the application of a control Hamil-
tonian of the form ∆csσx

s at t = 0 such that

We note that as mentioned above,
in higher dimen-
sions d > 2/ν − 2z, the scaling forms (19) reduce to
|∆cs| ≫ Ld/2. Clearly, ∆cs is independent of the ex-
act time dependence of Bz
f ree,s(t). In the other limit of
the CS interacting with a ﬁnite number of spins instead
of the global coupling considered in Eq.
(16), α does
not scale with system size any more and we simply have
|∆cs| ≫ πr/2 [42].

from an initial ground state corresponding to H(r = hs =
0). One can show that as before, the oﬀ-diagonal terms
of the two central spin reduced density matrix decay at

a rate exp(cid:2)−αδt2(cid:3). Once again LSTA in this case for
g → ±1 would require ﬂipping the central spins to | ↓↓i
state by application of local control ﬁelds of the form
∆cs (σx

s2) with |∆cs| ≫ πrL1/2/2.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown the possibility of gener-
ating LSTA in quantum critical spin systems driven out
of equilibrium by application of local control Hamiltoni-
ans. The subsystem under consideration can range from
a single spin to half of the spin system. We have derived
generic scaling forms for the control ﬁelds with the sys-
tem size near a QCP. Interestingly, the control ﬁelds can
be related to reduced ﬁdelity susceptibility as well. We
have also extended our analysis to transitionless dynam-
ics in a central spin model with one or two central spins,
where the central spin(s) interact uniformly with all spins
of an environmental spin chain. Our studies points to a

lower bound of the control ﬁeld in this case, which again
scales with the system size following a generic scaling
law. Finally we have veriﬁed our generic scaling results
using the exactly solvable transverse Ising model in one
dimension, where the control ﬁelds scale sub-extensively
with the system size, thus oﬀering the possibility of engi-
neering LSTA with robust control protocols even in large
systems.

V. APPENDIX

We determine hz and J by solving the set of coupled
diﬀerential equations near the QCP t ≈ ±τ , obtained
from Eq. (4) viz.

As initial condition we assume the system starts from

its ground state at time t = t0 → −τ −.

We note that J(t) and hence hz(t) may diverge in the
limit y2(t) → 0.
In this case one can replace y2(t) by
a second error parameter sign(y2(t))ǫ2 (where as before,
0 < ǫ2 ≪ 1) for |y2(t)| < ǫ2 in order to restrict J(t)
and hz(t) to ﬁnite values. Here sign(y2(t)) = 1 (−1) for
positive (negative) y2(t).
