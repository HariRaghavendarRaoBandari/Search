MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS WITH RESPECT TO HIGH-RANK

CONES ON A BANACH SPACE

LIRUI FENG∗, YI WANG† , AND JIANHONG WU‡

Abstract. We consider semiﬂows in general Banach spaces motivated by monotone cyclic feed-
back systems or diﬀerential equations with integer-valued Lyapunov functionals. These semiﬂows
enjoy strong monotonicity properties with respect to cones of high ranks, which imply order-related
structures on the ω-limit sets of precompact semi-orbits. We show that for a pseudo-ordered precom-
pact semi-orbit the ω-limit set Ω is either ordered, or is contained in the set of equilibria, or possesses
a certain ordered homoclinic property. In particular, we show that if Ω contains no equilibrium, then
Ω itself is ordered and hence the dynamics of the semiﬂow on Ω is topologically conjugate to a com-
pact ﬂow on Rk with k being the rank. We also establish a Poincar´e-Bendixson type Theorem in the
case where k = 2. All our results are established without the smoothness condition on the semiﬂow,
allowing applications to such cellular or physiological feedback systems with piecewise linear vector
ﬁelds and to such inﬁnite dimensional systems where the C 1-Closing Lemma or smooth manifold
theory has not been developed.

1. Introduction. We consider the global dynamics of a continuous semiﬂow Φt
monotone with respect to a cone C of rank-k on a Banach space X, here roughly
speaking, a cone C of rank-k is a closed subset of X that contains a linear subspace
of dimension k and no linear subspaces of higher dimension. Krasnoselskii et al.
[17] introduced the cones of rank-k and obtained a generalized Krein-Rutman theory
associated with these high-rank cones, see also Fusco and Oliva [5] for important
discussions in the ﬁnite dimensional case.

For a given convex cone K, K ∪ (−K) deﬁnes a cone of rank-1. Therefore, our
considered a class of semiﬂows includes the order-preserving (monotone) semiﬂows well
studied since the pioneering work of Hirsch [7–12]. An essential diﬀerence between a
convex cone K and a high-rank cone is the lack of convexity in the high-rank cone.
This diﬀerence makes the study of dynamics of semiﬂows with respect to a high-rank
cone a challenging task.

An important example of a continuous semiﬂow monotone with respect to a cone

of rank-2 is the following monotone cyclic feedback system

˙xi = f i(xi, xi−1),

i(mod n),

∂xi−1

∂xi−1

where each f i is C1-smooth, and the variable xi−1 forces ˙xi monotonically, namely
δi ∂f i(xi,xi−1)
> 0 with some δi ∈ {1, −1}. We have either inhibition if δi < 0 or
excitation if δi > 0, and the entire system is said to have a negative (if Πn
i=1δi < 0) or
i=1δi > 0) feedback. It has been shown that the Poincar´e-Bendixson the-
positive (if Πn
orem holds for such a monotone cyclic system (see [23] and references therein), and this
remains true even for its extensions involving delays in the feedback [24–26]. These
monotone cyclic systems arise very naturally from cellular, neural and physiological
control systems. However, it should be remarked that in these systems, specially those
arising from additive neural network models where the feedback function is piecewise
constant (binary on-or-oﬀ) or piecewise linear [15, 21, 41], the monotonicity condition
δi ∂f i(xi,xi−1)
> 0 is normally replaced by strict monotonicity without involving the
derivative, the semiﬂow is still monotone but is no longer C1-smooth. Thus argu-
ments based on the C1-Closing Lemma and/or invariant manifold theories cannot be
applied to such semiﬂows even in ﬁnite dimensional spaces. One of the contributions of
our work is to establish the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem for general semiﬂows mono-
tone with respect to high-rank cones deﬁned on a general Banach space without the
C1- smoothness condition on the semiﬂows. This contribution is also signiﬁcant for
other classes of dynamical systems with integer-valued Lyapunov functionals including
scalar parabolic equations on an interval or a circle [2, 14, 31, 32, 39], and competitive-
cooperative tridiagonal systems [3, 4, 18, 33, 34]. Other models arising from important
applications, to which our results can be applied, include n-dimensional competitive
dynamical systems (see [9, 13, 35, 40] and references therein) which can be viewed as
strongly monotone systems with respect to the cone C of rank-(n − 1) whose comple-
mented cone is of rank-1.

We will call a semiﬂow, that is monotone with respect to a particular order
deﬁned by a convex cone (recall that this generated a semiﬂow with respect to a cone
of rank-1), a classical monotone semiﬂow. For the classical monotone semiﬂow, the
pioneering work by Hirsch [7–12] showed that a precompact semi-orbit generically
approaches the set of equilibria (referred as generic quasi-convergence). Subsequent
studies conclude that for a classical smooth strongly monotone system, precompact
semi-orbits are generically convergent to equilibria in the continuous-time case [13,35]
or to cycles in the discrete-time case [27, 28]. There are exactly two diﬀerent kinds of
nontrivial (not an equilibrium) semi-orbits for the classical monotone systems: pseudo-
ordered semi-orbits and unordered semi-orbits. A nontrivial semi-orbit O+(x) :=
{Φt(x) : t ≥ 0} is called pseudo-ordered if O+(x) possesses one pair of distinct ordered-
points Φt(x), Φs(x) (i.e., Φt(x) − Φs(x) ∈ K ∪ (−K)); while O+(x) called unordered
if any pair of distinct points in O+(x) is unordered (see Deﬁnition 2.3 with C =

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

3

K ∪ (−K)). In the classical monotone semiﬂows, every pseudo-ordered precompact
orbit converges to equilibrium due to the Monotone Convergence Criterion for Φt (see,
e.g. [35, Theorem 1.2.1]), while any unordered orbit can be projected over a certain
1-codimensional hyperplane outside K ∪ (−K). A geometrical insight of the structure
of K ∪ (−K) yields that it consists of 1-dimensional linear subspaces and contains no
higher dimensional subspaces. As a consequence, as long as Φt(x) is pseudo-ordered,
one may project Φt(x) onto a straight line so that the corresponding dynamics is
essentially the same as that in an 1-dimensional system, which makes the Monotone
Convergence Criterion quite natural.

Since the Monotone Convergence Criterion plays a key role in the classical mono-
tone systems with respect to K, one naturally wonders if it still holds for monotone
systems with respect to a high-rank cone. Recently, Sanchez [29,30] tackled this prob-
lem for monotone ﬂows Φt on Rn with respect to a high-rank cone C. By using the
C1-Closing Lemma, he proved that if Φt is smooth and C-cooperative (see [29, Deﬁni-
tion 6]), which is stronger than strong monotonicity of the ﬂow, then the closure Ω1 of
any orbit in the omega-limit set Ω of a pseudo-ordered orbit is ordered with respect to
C, and hence, the corresponding ﬂow on Ω1 is essentially k-dimensional. The ordering
property of the omega-limit set Ω itself, however, remains unknown (see [29, p.1984]).
Our focus here, for a continuous monotone semiﬂow Φt with respect to a cone
C of rank-k on a Banach space X, is the ordering property of the omega-limit set Ω
of a pseudo-ordered orbit. We will ﬁrst show that if Φt is strongly monotone with
respect to C, then the closure of any orbit in Ω is ordered (see Theorem A). As we
mentioned above, for the ﬁnite dimensional case X = Rn, Sanchez [29] has obtained
this result for C1-smooth ﬂows by using the Closing Lemma. However, to the best of
our knowledge, the Closing Lemma is not established in general inﬁnite-dimensional
spaces. Moreover, even in the case of X = Rn, the results of Sanchez based on
the use of Closing Lemma cannot be applied to our setting where the smoothness is
not imposed for the semiﬂow. As a consequence, our results are novel even for the
ﬁnite-dimensional case, and this gives an aﬃrmative answer to the question posed
in [29, Remark 3].

We further examine the ordering property of the omega-limit set Ω itself. We

obtain the following trichotomy result (see Theorem B):

(i) Either Ω is ordered, i.e., p − q ∈ C for any p, q ∈ Ω;
(ii) Or Ω ⊂ E is unordered, where E is the set of all the equilibria of Φt;
(iii) Or Ω possesses an ordered homoclinic property, that is, there is an ordered
and invariant subset ˜B ( Ω such that, for any p ∈ Ω\ ˜B, it holds that ω(p)∪α(p) ⊂ ˜B
and α(p) ⊂ E.

An immediate consequence of the trichotomy is that Ω itself is ordered if Ω contains no
equilibrium. This partially solves the problem posed in [29, Line 15-16, p.1984] even
for the inﬁnite dimensional case. As a consequence, the dynamics on Ω is topologically
conjugate to a compact ﬂow on Rk when Ω contains no equilibrium.

4

LIRUI FENG, YI WANG, AND JIANHONG WU

When k = 2 and X = Rn, Sanchez [29] further concluded that if Ω contains no
equilibrium, then Ω itself is an ordered closed orbit, a conclusion that we will refer
as to the Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem for Φt. The crucial tools in his proof are the
generalized Perron-Frobenius Theorem (see [5]) and theory of invariant manifolds in
Rn, which again strongly depend on the C1-smoothness assumption on Φt. In Section
5, we remove this smoothness assumption (see Theorem C), based on the approach
motivated by [35] with the use of the chain-recurrent property of Ω.

Finally, we also would like to mention the work by Smith [36,37] that established a
Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem for systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations possessing
a certain quadratic Lyapunov function. We will show that our Theorem C is indeed
a generalization of the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem of Smith in [36, 37]. Under the
smoothness assumption, Sanchez [29] has successfully established the connections be-
tween Smith’s results and the strongly monotone systems with respect to some cones
of rank-2. Our work also shows that such a connection remains valid even for a locally
Lipschitz continuous vector ﬁeld which is not necessarily deﬁned in the whole phase
space.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we will introduce some notations
and deﬁnitions, and summarize some established facts for cones of rank-k and the
strongly monotone continuous semiﬂows with respect to such high-rank cones. We
will present the main results in this section but defer the detailed proofs to Sections
3-5. In Section 3, by using the non-wondering property, we prove that the closure of
any orbit in the omega-limit set Ω of a pseudo-ordered orbit is ordered (see Theorem
A). Based on this, in Section 4, we focus on the ordering property of Ω itself and prove
the corresponding trichotomy of Ω (see Theorem B). In particular, when Ω does not
contain any equilibrium, we show that the dynamics on Ω is topologically conjugate to
a compact ﬂow on Rk. For k = 2, we prove, in Section 5, the Poincar´e-Bendixson The-
orem (Theorem C). Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the relationship between strongly
monotone continuous systems and other well-known systems mentioned above, as well
as a generalization of the extended Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem of R. A. Smith.

2. Notations and main results. We start with some notations and a few

deﬁnitions. Let (X, k·k) be a Banach space. We ﬁrst deﬁne a cone of rank-k.

Definition 2.1. A closed set C ⊂ X is called a cone of rank-k (abbr. k-cone) if

the following are satisﬁed:

i) For any v ∈ C and l ∈ R, lv ∈ C;
ii) max{dim W : C ⊃ W linear subspace} = k.

Roughly speaking, a k-cone C ⊂ X contains a linear subspace of dimension k and
no linear subspaces of higher dimension. To the best of our knowledge, k-cone was
independently introduced by Krasnoselskii et al. [17] and Fusco & Oliva [5]. In par-
ticular, given any traditional convex cone K ⊂ X (see, e.g. [35]), it is clear that
C = K ∪ (−K) deﬁnes a 1-cone. Other concrete examples of k-cones can be found
in [5, 17, 18, 24–26, 29, 36–39]. The essential diﬀerence between k-cones and the 1-cone

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

5

K ∪ (−K) is the lack of convexity.

A k-cone is C ⊂ X is said to be solid if the interior intC 6= ∅; and C is called
k-solid if there is a k-dimensional linear subspace W such that W \ {0} ⊂ intC. Given
a k-cone C ⊂ X, we call C is complemented if there exists a k-codimensional space
H c ⊂ X such that H c ∩ C = {0}.

For two points x, y ∈ X, we say that x and y are ordered, denoted by x ∼ y, if
x − y ∈ C. Otherwise, x, y are called to be unordered, which we denote by x ⇁ y.
The pair x, y ∈ X are said to be strongly ordered, denoted by x ≈ y, if x − y ∈ intC.
For sets A, B we write A ∼ B if x − y ∈ C for any x ∈ A and y ∈ B.

A subset W ⊂ X is called ordered if x ∼ y for any x, y ∈ W . W is called unordered

(also called strongly balanced in [29]) if x ⇁ y for any two disctinct x, y ∈ W .

A semiﬂow on X is a continuous map Φ : R+ × X → X which satisﬁes: (i)
Φ0 = idX ; (ii) Φt ◦ Φs = Φt+s for t, s ≥ 0. Here Φt(x) = Φ(t, x) for t ≥ 0 and x ∈ X
and idX is the identity map on X.

Definition 2.2. A continuous semi-ﬂow Φt is called monotone with respect to a

k-solid cone C if

Φt(x) ∼ Φt(y), whenever x ∼ y and t ≥ 0;

and Φt is called strongly monotone with respect to C if Φt is monotone with respect
to C and

Φt(x) ≈ Φt(y), whenever x 6= y, x ∼ y and t > 0.

Let x ∈ X, the positive semi-orbit of x is denoted by O+(x) = {Φt(x) : t ≥ 0}. A
negative semi-orbit (resp. full-orbit) of x is a continuous function ψ : R− = {t ∈ R|t ≤
0} → X (resp. ψ : R → X) such that ψ(0) = x and, for any s ≤ 0 (resp. s ∈ R),
Φt(ψ(s)) = ψ(t + s) holds for 0 ≤ t ≤ −s (resp. 0 ≤ t). Clearly, if ψ is a negative
semi-orbit of x, then ψ can be extended to a full orbit

(.)

˜ψ(t) =( ψ(t),

Φt(x), t ≥ 0.

t ≤ 0,

On the other hand, any full orbit of x when restricted to R− is a negative semi-orbit
of x. Since Φt is just a semiﬂow, a negative semi-orbit of x may not exist, and it is
not necessary to be unique even if one exists. Hereafter, we denote by O−
b (x) (resp.
Ob(x)) a negative semi-orbit (resp. full-orbit) of x. In particular, we write them as
O−(x) (resp. O(x)) if such a negative semi-orbit (resp. full-orbit) is unique.

An equilibrium is a point x for which O+(x) = {x} (also called a trivial semi-
orbit). Let E be the set of all the equilibria of Φt. A nontrivial O+(x) is said to be
a T -periodic orbit for some T > 0 if ΦT (x) = x. A subset S ⊂ X is called positively
invariant if Φt(S) ⊆ S for any t ≥ 0, and is called invariant if Φt(S) = S for any

6

LIRUI FENG, YI WANG, AND JIANHONG WU

t ≥ 0. Clearly, for any x ∈ S, there exists a negative semi-orbit of x provided that S
is invariant.

The ω-limit set ω(x) of x ∈ X is deﬁned by ω(x) = ∩s≥0∪t≥sΦt(x). If O+(x)
is precompact (i.e., O+(x) is compact), then ω(x) is nonempty, compact, connected
and invariant. Hence, any z ∈ ω(x) admits in ω(x) a negative semi-orbit, as well as a
full-orbit.

Given a negative semi-orbit O−

b (x) of x, if O−

b (x) is precompact, then the α-limit
b (x) is deﬁned by αb(x) = {∩s≥0∪t≥sψ(−t)}. We write α(x) as the

set αb(x) of O−
α-limit set of O−(x) if x admits a unique negative semi-orbit.

A point x ∈ X is called non-wandering if, for any neighborhood U of x and time
T > 0, there is a y ∈ U and a t > T such that Φt(y) ∈ U . Let S ⊂ X be an invariant
subset and x1, x2 ∈ S. For ε, r > 0, a ﬁnite sequence {x1 = y1, y2, . . . , yn+1 =
x2; t1, t2, . . . , tn} of points yi ∈ S and times ti ≥ r is called (ε, r)-chain from x1 to x2
in S if Φti(yi) ∈ Bε(yi+1), i = 1, 2 . . . , n. Here Bε(yi+1) = {z ∈ X : kz − yi+1k < ǫ}.
A point x ∈ S is called chain-recurrent in S if there is an (ε, r)-chain from x to
itself in S for any ε, r > 0. A subset M ⊂ S is said to be chain recurrent if each
point in M is chain-recurrent in S. It is easy to see that the ω-limit set ω(x) of a
precompact positive semi-orbit O+(x) is always chain-recurrent in both ω(x) and X
(See [35, Appendix. Chain Recurrence]).

An invariant set S ⊂ X is called minimal if it does not contain any proper
invariant subset. Let S ⊂ X be a minimal set. Then any x ∈ S satisﬁes the following
for any neighborhood U of x, the set N (x, U ) = {t > 0 : Φt(x) ∈ U }
property:
is relatively dense in R+, which means that there exists a positive number l > 0,
depending on x and U , such that N (x, U ) ∩ [t, t + l] 6= ∅ for any t ≥ 0.

Definition 2.3. A nontrivial semi-orbit O+(x) is called pseudo-ordered (also
called of Type-I), if there exist two distinct point Φt1 (x), Φt2 (x) in O+(x) such that
Φt1 (x) ∼ Φt2(x). Otherwise, O+(x) is called unordered (also called of Type-II), that
is, any two distinct point Φt1(x), Φt2 (x) satisﬁes Φt1 (x) ⇁ Φt2 (x).

Definition 2.4. Let S ⊂ X be an invariant set with respect to {Φt}t≥0. Φt is
said to admit a ﬂow extension on S, if there is a ﬂow { ˜Φt}t∈R such that ˜Φt(x) = Φt(x)
for any x ∈ S and t ≥ 0.

If S is locally compact, then S admits a ﬂow extension if and only if the negative
semi-orbit (and hence the full-orbit) of any x ∈ S is unique (see [32, p.26, Theorem
2.3]).

Throughout this paper, we always impose the following assumptions:

(A1) Φt is a continuous semiﬂow which is strongly monotone with respect to a

k-solid cone C.

(A2) Any nonempty ω-limit set for Φt admits a ﬂow extension.

Now we are ready to present the main results of this paper. Among them, The-

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

orems A-C mainly focus on the pseudo-ordered (Type-I) positive semi-orbits; while
Theorem D concerns with the unordered (Type-II) positive semi-orbits. The proof of
these theorems will be provided in the remaining sections.

Theorem A. Assume (A1)-(A2) hold. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered
precompact semi-orbit. Then the closure of any full-orbit in ω(x) is ordered.

Remark 2.5. For C1-smooth ﬂows on X = Rn, Theorem A was proved in [29] by
using the Closing Lemma (see, e.g. [1]). However, the Closing Lemma is still unknown
in the inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, and moreover; even in the ﬁnite dimensional case
of X = Rn, the Closing Lemma still cannot work because there is no smoothness
assumption on Φt in our setting. Consequently, Theorem A is new even for the
ﬁnite-dimensional case, which also gives an aﬃrmative answer to the question posed
in [29, Remark 3].

Remark 2.6. As for the ordering property of ω(x) itself, it remains unknown.
The following Theorem (Theorem B) will provide a trichotomy for the ordering prop-
erty of ω(x). An immediate consequence of such trichotomy is that if ω(x) does not
contain any equilibrium, then ω(x) itself is ordered. This partially solves the problem
posed in [29, Line 15-16, p.1984].

Theorem B. Assume (A1)-(A2) hold. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered
precompact semi-orbit. Then one of the following three alternatives must hold:

(i) ω(x) is ordered;
(ii) ω(x) is unordered, and moreover, ω(x) ⊂ E;
(iii) ω(x) possesses an ordered homoclinic property, i.e., there is an ordered and

invariant subset ˜B ( Ω such that, for any p ∈ Ω \ ˜B, it holds that

α(p) ∪ ω(p) ⊂ ˜B and α(p) ⊂ E.

In particular, if ω(x) ∩ E = ∅, then ω(x) itself is ordered. Moreover, if C is
complemented, then ω(x) is topologically conjugate to a compact invariant set of a
Lipschitz-continuous vector ﬁeld in Rk.

Based on Theorem B, we can obtain the following

Theorem C. Assume (A1)-(A2) hold. Assume that k = 2 and C is complemented.
Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact semi-orbit. If ω(x) ∩ E = ∅,
then ω(x) is a periodic orbit.

Remark 2.7. When dim X < ∞ (X = Rn), Theorem C was proved by Sanchez
[29, Theorem 1], which we now refer to the Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem for Φt. The
crucial tools of the proof in [29] are the generalized Perron-Frobenius Theorem (see
[22]) and theory of invariant manifolds in Rn, which strongly depend on the C1-
smoothness assumption of Φt. Here, proved the Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem for Φt
on a Banach space X without the smoothness assumption.

8

LIRUI FENG, YI WANG, AND JIANHONG WU

Theorem D. Assume (A1)-(A2) hold. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial unordered precom-
pact semi-orbit for Φt. Then ω(x) itself is either an equilibrium or unordered.

Remark 2.8. Finally, it deserves to point out that we here only require the
ﬂow extension on the ω-limit sets (see (A2)). In a semiﬂow which is generated by
a diﬀerential equation such as parabolic equation or a certain delayed equation (see,
e.g. [32, Part III]), the semiﬂow itself does not admit a ﬂow extension in general, but
an ω-limit set does. Further applications of the theory developed in these theorems
will be provided in a forthcoming paper.

3. Proof of Theorem A. We ﬁrst need the following Proposition:
Proposition 3.1. If x is a non-wandering point and there is some T > 0 such

that x ∼ ΦT (x) with x 6= ΦT (x), then O+(x) is ordered.

Proof. Deﬁne T1 = sup{t ≥ T : x ∼ Φs(x) for all s ∈ [T, t]}. Suppose that
T1 < +∞. Then x ∼ ΦT1 (x). If x = ΦT1(x), we have done by using the same argument
in [29, Proposition 2]. If x 6= ΦT1(x), then ﬁx a τ > 0, it follows from the strongly
monotone property and the continuity of Φτ that one can ﬁnd a neighborhood U of x
and a neighborhood V of ΦT1 (x) such that Φτ (U ) ∼ Φτ (V ), and hence Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V )
for any t ≥ τ .

Choose an ε > 0 so small that Bε(ΦT1 (x)) ⊂ V , where Bε(x) is the ball cen-
tered at x ∈ X with the radius ε > 0. For such ε > 0, choose some δ1 > 0 such
that ΦT1 (Bδ1 (x)) ⊂ Bε/3(ΦT1 (x)), and hence, there exists some l > 0 such that
ΦT1+s(x) ∈ Bε/3(ΦT1 (x)) for any s ∈ [−l, l]. So, for every s ∈ [−l, l], one can ﬁnd
some δ(s) ∈ (0, δ1) such that ΦT1+s(Bδ(s)(x)) ⊂ Bε(ΦT1 (x)). Moreover, it follows
from the compactness of [−l, l] that inf s∈[−l,l] δ(s) = δ > 0. As a consequence,

(.)

ΦT1+s(Bδ(x)) ⊂ Bε(ΦT1 (x)) for all s ∈ [−l, l].

By choosing such δ > 0 small, if necessary, we assume that Bδ(x) ⊂ U . Recall that
Bε(ΦT1 (x)) ⊂ V . Then

(.)

Φt(Bδ(x)) ∼ Φt(Bε(ΦT1 (x))) for all t ≥ τ.

Since x is a non-wondering point, there are two sequences yn → x and τn → ∞ such
that Φτn (yn) → x as n → ∞. Therefore, one may assume without loss of generality
that yn ∈ Bδ(x) and τn > τ for any n ≥ 1. By virtue of (.), it entails that

ΦT1+s(yn) ⊂ Bε(ΦT1 (x)),

for all s ∈ [−l, l] and n ≥ 1.

Together with (.), this implies that

Φτn (yn) ∼ Φτn(ΦT1+s(yn)),

for all s ∈ [−l, l] and n ≥ 1.

By letting n → ∞, it yields that x ∼ ΦT1+s(x) for all s ∈ [−l, l], which contradicts
the deﬁnition of T1. Thus, T1 = +∞.

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

9

Similarly, we deﬁne T2 = inf{t > 0 : x ∼ Φt(x)}. By following the same argument
for proving T1 = +∞, one can obtain that T2 = 0. Thus, we have proved that O+(x)
is ordered. Moreover, by the closedness of C, we can further obtain that O+(x) is
ordered.

Remark 3.2.

By (A1), a simple fact can be deduced from the above proof
is that: If x ∼ ΦT (x) with x 6= ΦT (x), then for any ﬁxed τ > 0, there exists a
neighborhood U of x and a neighborhoods V of ΦT (x) such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for
all t ≥ τ .

Now we are ready to prove Thoerem A.

Proof of Theorem A. By virtue of (A2), any p ∈ ω(x) admits a unique full-orbit

O(p) ⊂ ω(x). Without loss of generality, we assume that p is not an equilibrium.

Denote by ψ : R → ω(x) the full-orbit with ψ(0) = p and ψ(t) = Φt(p) for t ≥ 0.
So ψ(s) is not an equilibrium for each s ∈ R. we now assert that there exists some
In fact, since O+(x) is
T > 0 such that ψ(s) 6= ΦT (ψ(s)) and ψ(s) ∼ ΦT (ψ(s)).
nontrivial and pseudo-ordered, there exist t2 > t1 ≥ 0 such that Φt1 (x) ∼ Φt2(x) and
Φt1 (x) 6= Φt2 (x). Choose a sequence τk → +∞ such that Φτk (Φt1 (x)) → ψ(s). Then
Φτk (Φt2 (x)) → ψ(s + t2 − t1). If ψ(s) 6= ψ(s + t2 − t1), then let T = t1 − t2, and hence,
ψ(s) ∼ ψ(s + T ) with ψ(s) 6= ψ(s + T ). Thus, we have done. If ψ(s) = ψ(s + t2 − t1),
then ﬁx some T1 > 0 and choose a neighborhood U (resp. V ) of ΦT1(Φt1 (x)) (resp.
ΦT1 (Φt2 (x))) such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for t ≥ 0. By the continuity of Φt, we take
0 < δ < T1 such that {ΦT1+θ(Φt1 (x)) : θ ∈ [−δ, δ]} ⊂ U and {ΦT1+θ(Φt2(x)) : θ ∈
[−δ, δ]} ⊂ V . Therefore, Φτk+s1 (Φt1(x)) ∼ Φτk+s2 (Φt2 (x)) for all s1, s2 ∈ [−δ, δ] and
k suﬃciently large. Together with ψ(s) = ψ(s + t2 − t1), this implies that the set
{ψ(s + θ) : θ ∈ [−δ, δ]} is ordered. Recalling that ψ(s) is not an equilibrium, we can
ﬁnd some T ∈ [0, δ] such that ψ(s) 6= ΦT (ψ(s)) and ψ(s) ∼ ΦT (ψ(s)). Thus, we have
proved the assertion.

Recall that any point in ω(x) is non-wandering. Together with the assertion,

Proposition 3.1 implies that O+(ψ(s)) is ordered for each s ∈ R.

For any z, w ∈ O(p), we only consider the case that there exist sn, tn → −∞ (as
n → ∞) such that ψ(sn) → z and ψ(tn) → w. Other cases are similar. Without loss
of generality, we assume that sn < tn for each n. So ψ(tn) ∈ O+(ψ(sn)), and hence,
one has ψ(tn) ∼ ψ(sn) for each n. Because of the closeness of C, it yields that z ∼ w.
(cid:3)
Thus, we have obtained O(p) is ordered.

4. Proofs of Theorems B and D. In this section, we focus on the ordering
property of the ω(x) itself under the fundamental assumptions (A1)-(A2). Theorems
B reveals the information of ω(x) with nontrivial pseudo-ordered semi-orbits; while
Theorem D concerns with nontrivial unordered semi-orbits.

We ﬁrst consider the omega limit sets of nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact
semi-orbits. By virtue of Theorem A, the closure of any full-orbit in ω(x) is ordered.
As a consequence, one may assume without loss of generality that any full-orbit O(a)

in ω(x) satisﬁes

(.)

(F)

O(a) ( ω(x),

for any a ∈ ω(x).

By virtue of (A2), the negative semi-orbit (hence the full-orbit) of any a ∈ ω(x) is
unique. For the sake of convenience, we hereafter write the unique negative semi-orbit
of a ∈ ω(x) as {Φ−s(a)|s ≥ 0} satisfying

(.)

Φt(Φ−s(a)) = Φt−s(a),

for any t, s ≥ 0.

In order to prove Theorem B, we ﬁrst present the following three technical lemmas.
Lemma 4.1. Let two compact sets K1, K2 satisfy K1 ∩ K2 = ∅ and K1 ∼ K2.
Then there are open sets U ⊃ K1, V ⊃ K2 and a T > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for
all t > T .

Proof. Since K1 ∩ K2 = ∅, any x ∈ K1 and y ∈ K2 satisfy x 6= y. By Remark
3.2, there exist open sets Ux,y ∋ x, Vx,y ∋ y and time Tx,y > 0 such that Φt(Ux,y) ∼
Φt(Vx,y) for all t > Tx,y.

Note that the family {Ux,y}x∈K1 of open sets covers of K1. Then we may choose a
i=1 Vxi,y and Ty = max{Txi,y :

ﬁnite subcover Uy := ∪m
i = 1, 2 . . . m}, then Φt(Uy) ∼ Φt(Vy) for all t ≥ Ty.

i=1Uxi,y of K1. Denote Vy =Tm

Moreover, since {Vy}y∈K2 is an open cover of K2, so one may choose a ﬁnite
: j =

j=1 Uyj and T = max{Tyj

subcover V = Sn

j=1 Vyj of K2. Denote U = Tn

1, 2 . . . n}, then Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for all t ≥ T .

Lemma 4.2. Let A ⊂ ω(x) be an invariant compact set. If there exists some

a ∈ ω(x) \ A with a ∼ A, then one has A ∼ ω(x).

Proof. By Lemma 4.1, there exist open sets U ∋ a,V ⊇ A and T0 > 0 such
that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for all t ≥ T0. Since A is invariant, one has Φt(U ) ∼ A for all
t ≥ T0. Noticing a ∈ ω(x), one can ﬁnd a T1 > 0 such that ΦT1 (x) ∈ U . So we obtain
ΦT1+t(x) ∼ A for t > T0, which directly implies that A ∼ ω(x).

Lemma 4.3.

(i) If a1 ∼ a2 and there is a sequence τk → ∞ such that Φτk (a1) → c and Φτk (a2) →

c, then either c ∈ E or O(c) is ordered.

(ii) Let a1, a2 ∈ ω(x). If a1 ⇁ a2 and there is a sequence τk → ∞ such that
Φ−τk (a1) → c and Φ−τk (a2) → c, then either c ∈ E or {Φt(c) | t ∈ [−δ, δ]}
unordered for some δ > 0.

Proof. (i) Fix T1 > 0 and choose open sets U ∋ ΦT1 (a1), V ∋ ΦT1 (a2) and such
that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for t ≥ 0. By continuity of Φt, take T1 > δ > 0 such that
{ΦT1+s(a1) : s ∈ [−δ, δ]} ⊂ U and {ΦT1+s(a2) : s ∈ [−δ, δ]} ⊂ V . Then we have
Φτk+s1 (a1) ∼ Φτk+s2 (a2) for s1, s2 ∈ [−δ, δ] and all k suﬃciently large. Recall that
c ∈ ω(ai), i = 1, 2. Then (A2) implies that the full-orbit O(c) of c is well-deﬁned and
satisﬁes O(c) ⊂ ω(ai), i = 1, 2. So, by letting k → ∞, we obtain that Φs1 (c) ∼ Φs2(c)
for any s1, s2 ∈ [−δ, δ]. This implies that O+(ai), i = 1, 2, are of type-I. Suppose

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

11

that c /∈ E. Then, by Theorem A and O(c) ⊂ ω(a1), we directly obtain that O(c) is
ordered.

(ii) Since a1, a2 ∈ ω(x), O(ai), i = 1, 2, are well-deﬁned. Noticing that a1 ⇁ a2,
there exist a neighborhood U1 (resp. U2) of a1 (resp. a2) such that U1 ⇁ U2. Take
a δ > 0 such that {Φs(Φ−δ(ai)) : s ∈ [0, 2δ]} ⊂ Ui for i = 1, 2. As a consequence,
Φ−τk−δ+s1 (a1) ⇁ Φ−τk−δ+s2 (a2) for any s1, s2 ∈ [0, 2δ] and all k > 0 suﬃciently
large. Suppose now that c /∈ E. Then we assert that Φs1 (c) ⇁ Φs2 (c) for any s1 6=
s2 ∈ [−δ, δ]. Otherwise, one can ﬁnd some s1, s2 ∈ [−δ, δ] such that Φ−τk+s1 (a1) ∼
Φ−τk+s2 (a2) for k large enough, a contradiction.

By the assumption (F) in (.), we may classify the closure O(a) of any given

orbit in ω(x) into the following two types:

(P1): O(a) ∼ ω(x); otherwise,
(P2):

there is some z ∈ ω(x) \ O(a) such that z ⇁ y for some y ∈ O(a).

By Lemma 4.2 and the invariance of O(a), it is easy to see that O(a) satisﬁes (P2) if
and only if, for any z ∈ ω(x) \ O(a), there exists some t0 ∈ R such that z ⇁ Φt0a.

Deﬁne

and

B = {O(b) ⊂ ω(x) : O(b) satiﬁes (P1)},

A = {O(a) ⊂ ω(x) : O(a) satiﬁes (P2)} and

˜B = [O(b)∈B

O(b),

˜A = [O(a)∈A

O(a).

Clearly, ˜A ∪ ˜B = ω(x), A ∩ B = ∅ and ˜B ∼ ω(x) (hence ˜B is ordered). Moreover, we
have further properties for these sets:

Proposition 4.4. (i) O(a) ∈ A if and only if ˜B ( O(a). Moreover, if A 6= ∅

then ˜A ∪ ˜B = ˜A = ω(x).

(ii) Let O(ai) ∈ A, i = 1, 2 satisfy O(a1) 6= O(a2). Then O(a1) * O(a2) and

O(a2) * O(a1). Moreover, O(a1) ∩ O(a2) ⊇ ˜B.

Proof. (i) If B = ∅, We have done. It only needs to consider the case that B 6= ∅.
Necessity. Let O(a) ∈ A, we ﬁrst show ˜B ⊂ O(a). Suppose that there is some
b ∈ ˜B \ O(a). Then b ∼ ω(x), and hence b ∼ O(a). It then follows from Lemma 4.2
that O(a) ∼ ω(x), which implies that O(a) ∈ B, a contradiction to A ∩ B = ∅. So we
have obtained that ˜B ⊂ O(a). Suppose that ˜B = O(a). Then O(a)(= ˜B) ∼ ω(x),
and again, one has O(a) ∈ B, a contradiction. Thus one obtains that ˜B ( O(a).

Suﬃciency. Suppose that O(a) ∈ B. Then one has ˜B ( O(a) ⊂ ˜B, a contradic-
tion. Moreover, if A 6= ∅, then ˜B ( O(a) for some O(a) ∈ A. Note that O(a) ⊂ ˜A.
Then one has ˜A ∪ ˜B = ˜A = ω(x).

(ii) Suppose that O(a1) ⊆ O(a2). Then O(a1) ( O(a2), because O(a1) 6= O(a2).
As a consequence, there exists b ∈ O(a2) such that b /∈ O(a1). Recall that O(a2) is
ordered. Then b ∼ O(a1). By Lemma 4.2, one has O(a1) ∼ ω(x), contradicting that

12

LIRUI FENG, YI WANG, AND JIANHONG WU

O(a1) ∈ A. Thus, we have proved that O(a1) * O(a2). Similarly, we can also obtain
O(a2) * O(a1).

The fact O(a1) ∩ O(a2) ⊇ ˜B is directly from (i).
Proposition 4.5. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact semi-
orbit and assume that (F) in (.) holds. Assume also that B 6= ∅. Then one of the
following alternatives holds:

(i) ω(x) is ordered; or otherwise,

(ii) A 6= ∅ and ω(x) possesses the following ordered homoclinic property: Given

any O(a) ∈ A, it holds that α(a) ∪ ω(a) ⊂ ˜B; and moreover, α(a) ⊂ E.

Proof.

If A = ∅ then ω(x) is clearly ordered. Suppose that the cardinality of
the set A is equal to 1, then it follows from Propsition 4.4(i) that ω(x) = ˜A = O(a)
for some a ∈ ω(x), which contradicts (F).

So, it suﬃces to consider the case that the cardinality of A is at least 2. Hence, for
any O(a1) ⊂ A, there exists O(a2) ⊂ A such that O(a1) 6= O(a2). Moreover, one may
assume without loss of generality that a1 ⇁ a2. Indeed, it follows from the argument
following the deﬁnition of (P2) that there is a y ∈ O(a2)\O(a1) such that y ⇁ Φt0(a1)
for some t0 ∈ R. Moreover, we can ﬁnd t1 ∈ R such that Φt1(a2) ⇁ Φt0(a1) since
y ∈ O(a2). Note that O(a1) = O(Φt0 (a1)) and O(a2) = O(Φt1 (a2)). Thus we may
assume that a1 ⇁ a2.

Choose any sequence tk → ∞ such that Φ−tk (ai) → ci, for i = 1, 2. Then either

(i) c1 = c2; or otherwise, (ii) c1 6= c2.

We claim that case (ii) cannot happen. Before proving this claim, we ﬁrst show
how it implies our conclusion. In fact, for any c ∈ α(a1), there is a sequence tk → ∞
such that Φ−tk (a1) → c as tk → ∞. By virtue of the claim, one can choose a
subsequence of {tk}, still denoted by {tk}, such that Φ−tk (a2) → c as tk → ∞.
Consequently, c ∈ α(a2), and hence, α(a1) ⊂ α(a2). Similarly, one can get α(a2) ⊂
α(a1). Thus, α(a1) = α(a2). By Lemma 4.3(ii), we can further obtain that α(a1) =
α(a2) ⊂ E (Otherwise, choose z ∈ α(a1)\E and some sk → +∞ such that Φ−sk (a1) →
z ∈ α(a1) = α(a2) ⊂ ω(x). Again, by the claim, one can assume that Φ−sk (a2) → z.
Since (A2) holds, O(z) is well-deﬁned. So Lemma 4.3(ii) implies that O(z) is locally
non-ordered. On the other hand, noticing O(z) ⊂ ω(x), it follows from Theorem A
that O(z) is ordered, a contradiction.)

Since α(a1) = α(a2), one has α(a1) ( O(a1) (For otherwise, O(a1) = α(a1) =
α(a2) ⊆ O(a2), which contradicts Proposition 4.4(ii)). So, by Lemma 4.2, we obtain
that α(a1) ∼ ω(x). As a consequence, α(a1)(= α(a2)) ⊂ ˜B ∩ E.

We now prove ω(a1) ⊂ ˜B. Since α(a2)(= α(a1)) ⊂ ˜B and O(a1) 6= O(a2), one
has a1 ∼ α(a2) and a1 /∈ α(a2). By Lemma 4.1, one can ﬁnd an open set U ⊃ α(a2)
and time T > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(a1) for t ≥ T . Choose τ > 0 so large that
Φ−t(a2) ∈ U for any t ≥ τ . Then Φ−t(a2) ∼ ΦT (a1) for all t ≧ τ − T . So, by the
monotonicity of Φt, we have Φt(a1) ∼ a2 for all t ≥ τ . This implies that ω(a1) ∼ a2.
However, note that a2 /∈ ω(a1) (otherwise O(a2) ⊆ ω(a1) ⊆ O(a1), a contradiction to

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

13

Proposition 4.4(ii)). Again, by Lemma 4.2, one has ω(a1) ∼ ω(x), which implies that
ω(a1) ⊂ ˜B. Thus, we have obtain all the statements in Proposition 4.5.

Finally, it suﬃces to prove the claim above. To this end, suppose that c1 6= c2.
Then we have c1 ⇁ c2, whose proof will be postponed to Lemma 4.6 below. So,
for the full-orbit O(ai), i = 1, 2, obtained above, it holds that ai ∈ O(ci), i = 1, 2.
(Otherwise, say a1 /∈ O(c1). Recalling that O(c1) ⊂ O(a1) and O(a1) is ordered, we
have a1 ∼ O(c1). Thus, Lemma 4.2 implies that ω(x) ∼ O(c1), a contradiction to
c1 ⇁ c2.) So, O(ai) ⊂ O(ci). Note also that ci ∈ α(ai). Then we have O(ai) = α(ai)
for i = 1, 2.

Now we can choose a sequence τk → ∞ such that Φ−τk(a1) → a1 and Φ−τk (a2) →
b as τk → ∞. Clearly, b 6= a1 (Otherwise, a1 ∈ O(a2). By Theorem A, we know
a1 ∼ a2, contracting to a1 ⇁ a2). Then, again by the forthcoming Lemma 4.6, one
obtains that O(a1) ⇁ b and a1 ⇁ O(b). Since b ∈ α(a2) ⊂ ω(x), O(b) is well-deﬁned.
Obviously, O(b) ∈ A. Now choose some d ∈ ˜B ( O(b) ∈ A (because B 6= ∅). Clearly,
d 6= a1 and d ∼ a1. So, there exists a neighborhood U (resp. V ) of a1 (resp. of d)
and a T1 > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for t ≥ T1. Let {sl}∞
l=1 ⊂ R be a sequence so
that Φsl(b) → d. Then one has ΦT1−τk (a1) ∼ ΦT1+sl (b) for all k, l suﬃciently large.
Now take τk so large that T1 − τk < 0, then it follows from the monotonicity of Φt≥0
that a1 ∼ Φτk+sl b, which contradicts a1 ⇁ O(b). Thus, we have completed the proof
of the claim.

Lemma 4.6. Let a1, a2 ∈ ω(x). Assume that a1 ⇁ a2 and Φ−tk (ai) → bi as
tk → +∞ for i = 1, 2. If b1 6= b2, then b1 ⇁ b2. Furthermore, b1 ⇁ O(b2) and
O(b1) ⇁ b2.

Proof. By the monotonicity of Φt, Φ−tk (a1) ⇁ Φ−tk (a2) for any k > 0. Suppose
that b1 ∼ b2. By Remark 3.2, there exists a neighborhood U (resp. V ) of b1 (resp.
V ) and T2 > 0 such that Φt(U )∼Φt(V ) for t ≥ T2. Choose some tk > T2 such that
Φ−tk (a1) ∈ U and Φ−tk (a2) ∈ V . Then ΦT2−tk (a1) ∼ ΦT2−tk (a2), which implies that
a1 ∼ a2, a contradiction. Thus, b1 ⇁ b2.

We now prove O(b1) ⇁ b2, the proof of b1 ⇁ O(b2) is similar. For any c1, c2 ∈

ω(x) with c1 ⇁ c2, deﬁne

Γ(c1, c2) = sup{t ≥ 0 : Φs(c1) ⇁ c2 for all s ∈ [−t, t]}.

Clearly, Γ(c1, c2) > 0. Deﬁne a positive function f (t) = Γ(Φ−t(a1), Φ−t(a2)) for t ≥ 0.
By strongly monotone property of Φt, it is easy to see that f (t) is nondecreasing with
respect to t ≥ 0. Note also that f (tk) ≤ Γ(b1, b2) for all tk > 0. Then Γ(b1, b2) is an
upper bound of f (t) on [0, +∞).

We assert that Γ(b1, b2) = supt≥0{f (t)}. Let {ln}+∞

n=1 be a increasing sequence
with positive number such that ln → Γ(b1, b2) as n → +∞. Clearly, the set L =
{Φs(b1) : s ∈ [−ln, ln]} is compact and L ⇁ b2. Then there exists a neighborhood U
(resp. V ) of L (resp. b2) such that U ⇁ V . Since Φ−tk (a2) ∈ V and Φs(Φ−tk (a1)) ∈ U
for all s ∈ [−ln, ln] and all k suﬃciently large, one has Φs−tk (a1) ⇁ Φ−tk (a2) for all

14

LIRUI FENG, YI WANG, AND JIANHONG WU

s ∈ [−ln, ln] and k suﬃciently large. So, one can ﬁnd some τ > 0 such that f (τ ) ≥ ln
for any n ∈ N +. Thus, we have proved the assertion.

Finally, we prove that Γ(b1, b2) = +∞ (and hence, O(b1) ⇁ b2). Suppose that
Γ(b1, b2) < +∞. Then Φ−Γ(b1,b2)(b1) ∼ b2 or ΦΓ(b1,b2)(b1) ∼ b2. Without loss of the
generality, we assume ΦΓ(b1,b2)(b1) ∼ b2. Then then exists a neighborhood U (resp.
V ) of ΦΓ(b1,b2)(b1) (resp. b2) and time T0 > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for all t ≥ T0.
Choose some σ > 0 so small that Φs(b1) ∈ U whenever |s − Γ(b1, b2)| ≤ σ. It then
follows that

(.)

ΦT0+Γ(b1,b2)−σ−tk (a1) ∼ ΦT0−tk (a2)

for k suﬃciently large. On the other hand, we have already known that Γ(b1, b2) =
supt≥0{f (t)} by the assertion above. So, one can ﬁnd a τ > 0 such that f (t) ≥
Γ(b1, b2) − σ for t ≥ τ , which implies that Φ−t+Γ(b1,b2)−σ(a1) ⇁ Φ−t(a2) for all t ≥ τ ,
a contradiction to (.). Thus, we have proved Γ(b1, b2) = +∞, which completes the
proof of the lemma.

Lemma 4.7. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact semi-orbit. If

there exist a, b ∈ ω(x) satisfying a ∼ b and O(a) ∩ O(b) = ∅, then B 6= ∅.

Proof. Given any z1 ∈ ω(a), there is a sequence tk → ∞ such that Φtk (a) → z1.
We may also assume without loss of generality that Φtk (b) → z2 ∈ ω(b). Because
O(a) ∩ O(b) = ∅, we have z1 ∼ z2 6= z1.

Let Γ∗(z1, z2) = sup{t ≥ 0 : z1 ∼ Φs(z2) for all s ∈ [−t, t]} and deﬁne the function
h(t) = Γ∗(Φt(a), Φt(b)) for t ≥ 0. Then it is not diﬃcult to see that h(t) is nonde-
creasing on [0, +∞). Note also that Γ∗(Φtk (a), Φtk (b)) ≤ Γ∗(z1, z2) for any k ≥ 0.
Then it follows that

(.)

for any t > 0.

Γ∗(Φt(a), Φt(b)) ≤ Γ∗(z1, z2)

Suppose that Γ∗(z1, z2) < +∞. Then we deﬁne K = {Φs(z2) : s ∈ [−Γ∗(z1, z2),
Γ∗(z1, z2)]}. Clearly, K is compact. Noticing that O(z1) ∩ O(z2) = ∅, one has z1 /∈
K. Then there exists U (resp. V ) of z1 (resp. K) and time T > 0 such that
Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(V ) for all t ≥ T . Therefore, one can ﬁnd an N > 0 such that Φtk (a) ∈ U
and Φtk+s(b) ∈ V for all k ≥ N and s ∈ [−Γ∗(z1, z2), Γ∗(z1, z2)]. Fix such an
N > 0, there is an ε > 0 such that Φs+l+tN (b) ∈ V whenever |s| ≤ Γ∗(z1, z2) and
|l| ≤ ε. Accordingly, we obtain that ΦtN +T (a) ∼ ΦtN +T +Γ∗(z1,z2)+ε(b); and hence,
Γ∗(ΦtN +T (a), ΦtN +T (b)) ≥ Γ∗(z1, z2) + ε, which contradicts (.). Thus we have
obtained Γ∗(z1, z2) = +∞, which implies that z1 ∼ O(z2).

By virtue of Lemma 4.2, we have O(z2) ∼ ω(x), i.e, B 6= ∅.

Proposition 4.8. Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact semi-
orbit and assume that (F) in (.) holds. Assume also that B = ∅. Then ω(x) ⊂ E
is a non-ordered set, where E is the set of all the equilibria of Φt.

MONOTONE SEMIFLOWS

15

Proof. Clearly, A 6= ∅ because B = ∅. So the cardinality of A is at least 2 due to
the condition (F) and the statement at the beginning of the proof of Proposition 4.5.
So, if O(a) and O(b) are any two distinct elements in A, then it follows from B = ∅
and Proposition 4.4(ii) that O(a) ∩ O(b) = ∅. By Lemma 4.7, one can further obtain
that a ⇁ b. (otherwise, B 6= ∅, a contradiction.)

We now claim that: For any a ∈ ω(x) and any neighborhood Bǫ(a) of a, Bǫ(a) ∩
ω(x) * O(a). Before we give the proof of the claim, we ﬁrst show how it implies our
conclusion. Suppose that one can ﬁnd an a ∈ ω(x) \ E. Then there exists T > 0 such
that a 6= ΦT (a). By Theorem A, a ∼ ΦT (a). Then, one can ﬁnd a neighborhood
V of ΦT (a) such that Φt(a) ∼ Φt(V ) for all t ≥ T1. Therefore, the above claim will
imply that there is a d ∈ V ∩ ω(x) with d /∈ O(ΦT (a)), and hence, O(d) ∩ O(a) = ∅.
Together with B = ∅, Lemma 4.7 entails that ΦT1(a) ⇁ ΦT1 (d). This contradicts
ΦT1 (U ) ∼ ΦT1(V ). Thus, we have proved that ω(x) ⊂ E. Again by Lemma 4.7,
one can further obtain that ω(x) is non-ordered, which are the statements in this
Proposition. So, in order to complete the proof of this Proposition, it suﬃces to prove
the claim above.

Proof of the claim: We ﬁrst point out that O(a) is a minimal set for any a ∈ ω(x).
Indeed, for any point a ∈ ω(x), the fact B = ∅ implies that O(a) ∈ A. Suppose that
O(a) is not minimal. Then one can ﬁnd some point c ∈ O(a) such that O(a)\O(c) 6= ∅.
Together with Lemma 4.2, it yields that O(c) ∈ B, contradicting B = ∅.

Now we suppose that the claim is not correct. Then there exists σ > 0 such that
Bσ(a) ∩ ω(x) ⊆ O(a). Recall that O(a) is a minimal set. Then one can ﬁnd a positive
integer N (a, σ) satisfying that: For any ﬁxed q > 0, there exists an integer r > 0 such
that

(.)

q ≤ r ≤ q + N (a, σ) and Φr(a) ∈ B σ

2

(a).

By virtue of (.), we can choose an increasing positive number sequence {tn}∞
satisfying (i) Φtn (a) ∈ B σ
one can take some n > 0 such that tn ≤ t < tn+1; and hence,

n=1
(a); (ii) |tn+1 − tn| ≤ N (a, σ). Then for any ﬁxed t > 0,

2

Φt(a) ∈ Φt−tn+1(Φtn+1(a)) ⊂ Φt−tn+1(B σ

2

(a)) ⊂ [s∈[0,N (a,σ)]

Φ−s(B σ

2

(a)).

Therefore, we will further see thatSs∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a)) is an open cover of O+(a).

Indeed, given any b ∈ O+(a), choose a sequence si > 0 such that Φsi (a) → b.
Since a is a minimal point, there exists τi such that si < τi < si + N (a, σ
2 ) and
Φτi(a) ∈ B σ

of generality, assume that ri → r ∈ [0, N (a, σ

(a) ⊆ Bσ(a). Consequently, ∪s∈[0,N (a,σ)]Φ−s(Bσ(a)) is an open cover
that Φr(b) ∈ B σ
of O+(a). Noticing that O+(a) = O(a) (because O(a) is a minimal), it follows that
∪s∈[0,N (a,σ)]Φ−s(Bσ(a)) is an open cover of O(a).

Recall that Bσ(a) ∩ ω(x) ⊆ O(a). It then follows that


 [s∈[0,N (a,σ)]

Φ−s(Bσ(a))

\ ω(x) ⊆ O(a)

(Otherwise, there exists a point d ∈ Φ−s(Bσ(a))∩ω(x) such that d /∈ O(a); and hence,
O(a) ∩ O(d) = ∅. Then, one has Φs(d) ∈ Bσ(a) ∩ ω(x) and O(Φs(d)) ∩ O(a) = ∅, a
contradiction to Bσ(a) ∩ ω(x) ⊆ O(a)).

On the other hand, it is clear that O(a) ⊆ (cid:16)Ss∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a))(cid:17)T ω(x).

So,

(.)


 [s∈[0,N (a,σ)]

Φ−s(Bσ(a))

\ ω(x) = O(a).

O(a), contradicting (F) in (.)).

As a consequence, we obtain that ω(x) *Ss∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a)) (Otherwise, ω(x) =
SinceSs∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a)) is an open cover of O(a), it follows from (.) that
one can ﬁnd a smaller open set U such that O(a) ⊂ U (Ss∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a)) and
U ∩ ω(x) = O(a). Noticing that ω(x) *Ss∈[0,N (a,σ)] Φ−s(Bσ(a)), we have obtained a

contradiction to the connectivity of ω(x). Thus, we have completed the proof.

Now we are ready to prove Theorems B and D.

Proof of Theorem B. If (F) in (.) does not hold, i.e., O(a) = ω(x) for some
a ∈ ω(x), it then directly follows from Theorem A that ω(x) is ordered. If (F) in (.)
holds, then Propositions 4.5 and 4.8 will imply the Trichotomy listed in Theorem B.
In particular, if ω(x)∩E = ∅, then case (ii) can not happen. Moreover, Proposition
4.5(ii) also implies that case (iii) can not happen either. As a consequence, ω(x) must
be ordered.

Finally, if C is completed, then we choose a codim-k subspace H c ⊂ X such that
H c ∩ C = {0}. Based on the deﬁnition of C, one can also ﬁnd a dim-k subspace
H ⊂ C. Consequently, H ∩ H c = {0}; and moreover, H ⊕ H c = X. Now take
Θ : X → H the linear projection onto H along H c. Since ω(x) is now ordered, one
has Θ(a) 6= Θ(b) for any distinct a, b ∈ ω(x). (Otherwise, a − b ∈ H c \ {0}. This then
implies that a − b /∈ C, contradicting that ω(x) is ordered). Denote by Θω := Θ|ω(x)
the restriction of Θ to ω(x). Clearly, Θω is an one-to-one map. Then one can repeat
the argument in the proof of [13, Theorem 3.17] to obtain that ω(x) is topologically
conjugate to a compact invariant set of a Lipschitz-continuous vector ﬁeld in Rk. (cid:3)

Proof of Theorem D. Assume that ω(x) is not an equilibrium. Suppose also that
there are two distinct points p, q ∈ ω(x) such that p ∼ q. Then one can ﬁnd open
sets U ∋ p, V ∋ q and time T > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∼ Φt(v) for t > T . Now choose
t1, t2 > 0 so large that Φt1 (x) ∈ U , Φt2(x) ∈ V . So, one has Φt1 (x) 6= Φt2 (x) and
Φt1+T (x) ∼ Φt2+T (x), which contradicts that O(x) is of Type-II.

5. Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem (Theorem C). In this section, we focus
on the Poincar´e-Bendixson type Theorem (Theorem 5.1 or Theorem C) for 2-cones.
As we mentioned in the introduction, Sanchez [29] obtained this Theorem by using the
generalized Perron-Frobenius Theorem (see [5]) and theory of invariant manifolds in
Rn, which strongly depend on the C1-smoothness assumption of Φt. We will prove this
Theorem on a Banach space X without this smoothness assumption. Our approach
is motivated by [35] and utilizes the chain-recurrent property of Ω.

Theorem 5.1. Let (A1)-(A2) hold. Assume that k = 2 and C is complemented.
Let O+(x) be a nontrivial pseudo-ordered precompact semi-orbit. If ω(x) ∩ E = ∅,
then ω(x) is a periodic orbit.

Proof. For brevity, we write L = ω(x). By virtue of Theorem B, L is ordered and
topologically conjugate to a ﬂow Ψt on the compact invariant set Θ(L) ⊂ R2. Clearly,
L is a chain-recurrent set. It is also not diﬃcult to see that Θ(L) is a chain-recurrent
set with respect to Ψt.

Note that Θ(L) ⊂ R2 and Θ(L) does not contain any equilibrium of Ψt (because
L ∩ E = ∅). Then, by following the same argument in [35, Theorem 4.1], the chain-
recurrent property of Θ(L) will imply that Θ(L) is either a single periodic-orbit or
consists of an annulus of periodic orbits.

We now rule out the possibility of the case that Θ(L) is an annulus of periodic
orbits. Suppose not, let γ be a periodic orbit in L such that the periodic orbit
Θ(γ) ⊂ Int(Θ(L)) ⊂ R2. Then Θ(γ) separates Θ(L) into two components. Fix
a, b ∈ L such that Θ(a), Θ(b) belong to the diﬀerent component of Θ(L) \ Θ(γ).
Since {Φt(x)}t≥0 will repeatedly revisit the neighborhood of a and b, Θ(Φt(x)) will
intersect Θ(γ) at a sequence tk → ∞. So, one can choose zk ∈ γ, k = 1, 2, · · · , such
that Θ(Φtk (x)) = Θ(zk), which entails that Φtk (x) ⇁ zk for k = 1, 2, · · · . Therefore,
one can obtain that, for any s > 0, there exists some ws ∈ γ such that Φs(x) ⇁ ws.
(Otherwise, one can ﬁnd some s > 0 such that Φs(x) ∼ γ. Then one can choose
some tk > s, it follows from monotonicity of Φt that Φtk (x) ∼ γ, contradicting
Φtk (x) ⇁ zk ∈ γ.)

Now, choose any y ∈ L\γ, there exists a sequence sn → ∞ such that Φsn x → y as
n → ∞. By the assertion above, one can also ﬁnd wn ∈ γ such that Φsn (x) ⇁ wn ∈ γ.
Without loss of generality, one can assume that wn → w ∈ γ as n → ∞. So, by
letting n → ∞, we have (by strongly monotone property) y ⇁ w or y − w ∈ ∂C \ {0}.
Noticing that y 6= w and y, w ∈ L, we have obtained a contradiction to the fact that
L is strongly ordered (see the following Remark 5.2).

Thus, we have rule out the possibility of the case that Θ(L) is an annulus of
periodic orbits. As a consequence, Θ(L) is a single periodic-orbit. This immediately
implies that L is a single periodic-orbit. We have completed the proof.

Remark 5.2. Due to the strong monotonicity (which is stronger than mono-
tonicity), we have ω(x) is strongly ordered, i.e., for any two points y, z ∈ ω(x),
y − z ∈ intC.

6. Discussion and further results. In this section, we will discuss the rela-
tionship between our work on strongly monotone systems with respect to k-cones and
the established theory of several well-known systems.

• Competitive Dynamical Systems. The well-known competitive dynamical systems
on Rn (see [13, 40] and references therein) can be viewed as monotone systems with
respect to the (n − 1)-cone C whose complemented cone is of rank-1.

In the terminology of strongly monotone systems with respect to C, one of the
most remarkable results in strongly competitive systems can be reformulated as: Any
omega-limit set of competitive systems is ordered with respect to C and is topologically
conjugate to a compact ﬂow in Rn−1 (see, e.g. [35, 40]), which is exactly the problem
we discussed in this paper. Moreover, for competitive systems, the additional non-
oscillation principle (see [7, 35, 40], due to the rank-1 property of the complemented
cones) guarantees that any omega-limit set is ordered with respect to C. While in our
setting, since the complemented cone is not necessarily rank-1, one can only obtain
the partial information of the ordering of the omega-limit sets as in our Theorems A,
B and D.

• Systems with Quadratic Cones.

Consider a system

(.)

˙x = F (x),

x ∈ S ⊂ Rn,

in which the function F : S → Rn satisﬁes a local Lipschitz condition in an open
subset S ⊂ Rn.

Let P be a constant real symmetric non-singular matrix n × n matrix, with 2

negative eigenvalues and (n − 2) positive eigenvalues. Then the set

(.)

C −(P ) = {x ∈ Rn : x∗P x ≤ 0}

is a 2-solid cone which is also complemented. Here x∗ denote the transpose of the
vector x ∈ Rn.

When F is of class C1 in (.), Sanchez [29] proved the connections between
R. Smith’s results [36, 37] and the strongly monotone systems with respect to the
quadratic cone C −(P ). In our work here, we conﬁrm this connection even for locally
Lipschitz continuous vector ﬁelds F . In this sense, Theorem C in Section 2 can be
viewed as a generalization of the Poincar´e-Bendixson Theorem of R. Smith in [36,37].
Proposition 6.1. Assume that there is a real number λ (not necessarily posi-

tive), such that

(.)

(x − y)∗ · P · [F (x) − F (y) + λ(x − y)] < 0

for any x, y ∈ S. Then the ﬂow generated by (.) is strongly monotone w.r.t. C −(P );
and hence, Theorem C holds for system (.).

Proof. For such λ, deﬁne V (x) = x∗P x, x ∈ Rn. A direct calculation yields that

d
dt

[V (x(t) − y(t)) + 2λV (x(t) − y(t))]

= 2(x(t) − y(t))∗P · [F (x(t)) − F (y(t)) + λ(x(t) − y(t))].

Together with (.), this implies that the function t 7→ e2λtV (x(t) − y(t)) is strictly
decreasing for t ≥ 0, whenever x(t), y(t) ∈ S.

Given any x − y ∈ C −(P ) \ {0}, one has x 6= y and V (x − y) ≤ 0.

It then
follows that e2λtV (x(t) − y(t)) < V (x − y) ≤ 0 for any t > 0. This entails that
V (x(t) − y(t)) < 0, that is, x(t) − y(t) ∈ IntC −(P ) for all t > 0. the ﬂow generated
by (.) is strongly monotone w.r.t. C −(P ).

Remark 6.2.

(i) In [36, 37], R.A. Smith assumed that F satisﬁes

(.)

(x − y)∗ · P · [F (x) − F (y) + λ(x − y)] ≤ −ǫ|x − y|2

for any x, y ∈ S, where λ, ǫ > 0 are positive constants and |x−y| denote the Euclidean
norm of the vector x − y. Clearly, Condition (.) is weaker than (.). As a con-
sequence, our Proposition 6.1 (which is based on the theory of monotone dynamical
systems w.r.t. 2-cone) can be viewed as a generalization of the Poincar´e-Bendixson
theorem of R. Smith in [36, 37].

(ii) Since there is no C1-smoothness assumption in Condition (.), we have
improved Proposition 7 in Sanchez [29]. As we mentioned in Remarks 2.5 and 2.7 in
Section 2, the smoothness assumption plays a key role in the approaches in [29].

(iii) If one assumes F is of class C1, by following the same arguments in Ortega

and Sanchez [22, Remarks 1-2], one may obtain that (.) holds if and only if

P DF (x) + (DF (x))∗P + λP < 0 for any x ∈ S,

where DF (x)∗ stands for the transpose of the Jacobian DF (x) and < represents
the usual order in the space of symmetric matrices. On the other hand, (7) in [29,
Proposition 7] is equivalent to existence of a (continuous) function λ : Rn → R such
that

P DF (x) + (DF (x))∗P + λ(x)P < 0 for any x ∈ Rn.
