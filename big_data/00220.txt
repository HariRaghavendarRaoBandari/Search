The notion of the electron Fermi surface is one of the characteristic concepts in the ﬁeld of
condensed matter physics, and it plays a crucial role in the understanding of the physical properties
of doped Mott insulators. Based on the t-J model, we study the nature of the electron Fermi surface
in the cobaltates, and qualitatively reproduce the essential feature of the evolution of the electron
Fermi surface with doping. It is shown that the underlying hexagonal electron Fermi surface obeys
Luttinger’s theorem. The theory also predicts a Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime,
where the region of the hexagonal electron Fermi surface along the Γ-K direction is suppressed by
the electron self-energy, and then six disconnected Fermi arcs located at the region of the hexagonal
electron Fermi surface along the Γ-M direction emerge. However, this Fermi-arc phenomenon at
the low-doped regime weakens with the increase of doping.

INTRODUCTION

Investigation of the oxide conductors has uncovered
many interesting electronic states characterized by the
strong electron correlation1–4, which include unconven-
tional superconductivity and anomalous properties in the
normal-state1–10. Except for the cuprates1,2, the discov-
ery of superconductivity in the cobaltates3,4 has gener-
ated great interest, since the cobaltate is probably the
only system other than the cuprates where a doped Mott
insulator becomes a superconductor. However, unlike the
cuprates that have a square lattice, the cobaltates have a
triangular lattice3,4, where the geometric spin frustration
exists. In a doped Mott insulator, a central issue in the
theory concerns the nature and topology of the electron
Fermi surface (EFS), since it can be measured experi-
mentally and its shape can have crucial inﬂuence on the
physical properties. The ﬁrst principle band calculations
predict that the cobaltates have a large EFS centered
around the Γ point of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and six
small pockets near the K points11. However, the angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measure-
ments on the cobaltates reveal only the large EFS12–20,
while six small EFS pockets near the K points are ab-
sent. In particular, these ARPES experimental data also
indicate that the area of EFS contains 1 + δ electrons,
and therefore fulﬁlls Luttinger’s theorem15,18,20, where δ
is the electron doping concentration. The existence of
an EFS in a doped Mott insulator is surprising because
superconductivity is realized when charge carriers are
doped into a parent Mott insulating state1–4. This Mott
insulating state emerges to be due to the strong electron

correlation21,22.
It has been originally argued that the
strong electron correlation may destroy the one-electron
band structure21, however, the observed EFS12–20 shows
that a momentum-space picture also is an appropriate
description of the electronic structure in a doped Mott
insulator.

The understanding of the nature of EFS and its evo-
lution with doping in a doped Mott insulator is a neces-
sary step toward understanding of the anomalous normal-
state properties of the system and the related super-
conducting mechanism. Although the evolution of EFS
with doping in the cobaltates has been well established
by now12–20, its full understanding is still a challenging
issue. Within the framework of the local-spin-density
approximation, the EFS topology in the cobaltates has
been studied numerically by taking into account the on-
site Coulomb interaction23, however, the obtained EFS
area is twice as large, and therefore is inconsistent with
the ARPES observations. Based on the multiband Hub-
bard model, the dynamical mean-ﬁeld (MF) numerical
simulation indicates that the Fermi pockets in the cobal-
tates become even larger in size than the local density
approximation24. On the other hand, the EFS topol-
ogy in a multiband Hubbard model on a triangular lat-
tice has been studied within the Hartree-Fock and renor-
malized MF approximation25, where the obtained EFS
topology in the presence of the strong on-site Coulomb
interaction is in qualitative agreement with the ARPES
measurements on the cobaltates. Moreover, the speciﬁc
EFS topology has been discussed within a combined clus-
ter calculation and renormalization group approach26,
and then some unusual properties has been explained.

In our recent work27, the nature of EFS and its evolu-
tion with doping in the cuprates has been studied by
taking into account the electron self-energy eﬀect due
to the interaction between electrons by the exchange of
spin excitations, and the results show clearly that al-
though there is a large EFS satisfying Luttinger’s theo-
rem, the antinodal region of EFS is suppressed by the
electron self-energy, and then the low-energy electron
excitations occupy four disconnected Fermi arcs located
around the nodal region, in qualitative agreement with
the ARPES observations28–33.
In particular, our theo-
retical results27 also indicate that the charge-order state
in the cuprates32–36 is driven by the Fermi-arc instabil-
ity, with a characteristic wave vector corresponding to
the hot spots of the Fermi arcs rather than the antin-
odal nesting vector. In this paper, we study the nature
of EFS and its evolution with doping in the cobaltates
along with this line.
In particular, we show that the
area enclosed by the hexagonal EFS is identical to the
total numbers of electrons as expected from Luttinger’s
theorem. Moreover, our theoretical result predicts a
Fermi-arc phenomenon in the cobaltates at the low-doped
regime, where the region of the hexagonal EFS along the
Γ-K direction is suppressed by the electron self-energy,
leading to that the hexagonal EFS is broken into six dis-
connected Fermi arcs centered around the region along
the Γ-M direction.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We
present the basic formalism in Section II, where we gen-
eralize the electron Green’s function from the previous
case of the doped square-lattice Mott insulators to the
present case for the doped triangular-lattice Mott insu-
lators, and then evaluate explicitly the electron spectral
function. Within this theoretical framework, we therefore
discuss the evolution of EFS of the cobaltates with doping
in Section III. It is shown that the Fermi-arc phenomenon
in the cobaltates at the low-doped regime weakens with
the increase of doping. Finally, we give a summary in
Section IV.

where the spinful fermion operator alσ = e−iΦlσ al keeps
track of the charge degree of freedom of the constrained
hole together with some eﬀects of spin conﬁguration
rearrangements due to the presence of the doped elec-
tron itself (charge carrier), while the spin operator Sl
represents the spin degree of freedom of the constrained
hole, then the local constraint of no double occupancy
is satisﬁed in the actual calculations. In particular, the
restriction of no double occupancy in a given site induces
a strong coupling between the charge and spin degrees
of
freedom of the constrained hole, which leads to
that the spin conﬁguration in the t-J model is strongly
rearranged due to the eﬀect of the charge-carrier hopping
on the spins.
In the fermion-spin theory, the charge
transport is mainly governed by the scattering of charge
carriers due to spin ﬂuctuations, while the scattering
of spins due to charge-carrier ﬂuctuations dominates
the spin dynamics. Based on the triangular-lattice t-J
model
in the fermion-spin representation, the charge
transport of the cobaltates has been discussed40, and the
obtained results show that the conductivity spectrum
has a low-energy peak and an unusual midinfrared band,
while the resistivity is characterized by a crossover from
the high-temperature metallic-like to low-temperature
insulating-like behavior, in qualitative agreement with
the experimental observations8.

of way in which the strongly repulsive Hubbard model,
or its equivalent, the t-J model can capture the essential
physics in a doped Mott insulator21,22,37. The t-J model
consists of two parts, the kinetic energy and magnetic
energy parts, respectively. The kinetic-energy term in
the present study includes the electron nearest-neighbor
(NN) hopping term t and next NN hopping term t(cid:48),
and therefore it makes electrons itinerant. In particular,
the NN hoping produces EFS, while the next NN
hoping produces the curvature. On the other hand,
the Heisenberg magnetic energy term with the NN
spin-spin antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange J describes
AF coupling between localized spins. The cobaltate is
an electron-doped Mott insulator3,4.
In this case, the
electron-doped t-J model on a triangular lattice is very
diﬃcult to analyze, analytically as well as numerically,

For the discussions of the nature of EFS and its evo-
lution with doping in the cobaltate, we need to cal-
culate the electron Green’s function of the triangular-
lattice t-J model, which is deﬁned as G(l − l(cid:48), t − t(cid:48)) =
†
(cid:104)(cid:104)Clσ(t); C
l(cid:48)σ(t(cid:48))(cid:105)(cid:105). This electron Green’s function in the
framework of the charge-spin separation is characterized
by the charge-spin recombination41–43, i.e., the charge
and spin degrees of freedom must combine to form the
constrained electron.
In our recent discussions of the
electronic structure of the cuprates, we27 have developed
a full charge-spin recombination scheme, where we have
shown that in the doped square-lattice Mott insulators,
the coupling form between the electron quasiparticle and
spin excitation is the same as that between the charge-
carrier quasiparticle and spin excitation, and then the
obtained electron Green’s function can give a consistent
description of the electronic structure of the cuprates.
Following our previous discussions for the doped square-

lattice Mott insulators27, the full electron Green’s func-

In this full electron Green’s function (1), the dynam-
ics of an electron quasiparticle at energy ω and momen-
tum k is determined by the scattering processes between
the electron quasiparticle itself and the internal spin
degree of freedom of the electron with which the elec-
tron quasiparticle is coupled. The scattering processes
renormalize the electron quasipaticle energies, and aﬀect
the lifetime. The inverse of the imaginary part of the
electron self-energy Σ1(k, ω) provides the electron quasi-
particle lifetime. In particular, the electron self-energy
Σ1(k, ω) in Eq. (1) is not an even function of ω, and is
self-consistently related with the electron Green’s func-
tion G(k, ω). For the evaluation of Σ1(k, ω), we break
up Σ1(k, ω) as Σ1(k, ω) = Σ1e(k, ω) + ωΣ1o(k, ω), with

Σ1e(k, ω) and ωΣ1o(k, ω) are the corresponding symmet-
ric and antisymmetric parts of Σ1(k, ω), respectively, and
then both Σ1e(k, ω) and Σ1o(k, ω) are even functions of
ω. In the static limit, we follow the common practice44,
and deﬁne the electron quasiparticle coherent weight as
F = 1− ReΣ1o(k, ω = 0) |kA , where the wave vector k

in ZF(k) has been chosen as kA = [π/3,
case, the full electron Green’s function in Eq. (1) can be
evaluated explicitly as,

√

G(k, ω) =

ZF

ω − ¯εk,

(5)

with ¯εk = ZFεk, reﬂecting a fact that in the static-limit
approximation, the electron quasiparticle is renormalized
by a factor ZF, which therefore suppresses the spectral
weight of the single-particle excitation spectrum27. Eq.
(5) also reﬂects a fact that in an interacting electron
system, the elementary excitation can be described as
the electron quasiparticle, but with a quasiparticle co-
herent weight ZF that decreases as the electron correla-
tion (then the interaction) increase, the remaining weight
being transferred to the incoherent electron excitations.
Substituting this electron Green’s function (5) and spin
bubble (3) into Eq. (2), the electron self-energy is there-

III. QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS

We are now ready to discuss the nature of EFS and
its evolution with doping in the cobaltates. In the cobal-
tates, it has been shown experimentally that the value
of the eﬀective electron hopping t is on the order of the
magnetic exchange coupling J 12,13, and in this case, the
commonly used parameters in this paper are chosen as
t/J = 1.5 and t(cid:48)/t = 0.2 for a qualitative discussion. Un-
less speciﬁed, the lattice parameter and reduced Planck
constant are set to unity.

A. Evolution of electron Fermi surface with doping

In the framework of the fermion-spin theory, the quasi-
particles of a doped Mott insulator consist of bare elec-
trons dressed by spin excitations, and are parameterized
by the electron spectral function A(k, ω). In particular,
the intensity of the electron spectra at zero energy is used
to map out the underlying EFS. Since the low-energy
electron excitations is determined by the electronic struc-
ture near EFS, the EFS topology plays a signiﬁcant role
in comprehending the unconventional physics in a doped
Mott insulator. For a clear illustration of the eﬀect of the
energy and momentum dependence of the electron self-
energy on EFS in the cobaltates, we ﬁrst discuss EFS
in the static-limit approximation for the electron self-
energy Σ1(k, ω). In this case, the electron spectral func-
tion A(k, ω) = −2ImG(k, ω) is obtained directly from
the above electron Green’s function (5) as,
A(k, ω) = 2πZFδ(ω − ¯εk),

(9)

where the energy and momentum dependence in the elec-
tron self-energy Σ1(k, ω) has been dropped, and then the

4

electron spectral function in Eq. (9) has a Dirac delta
function form on the quasiparticle dispersion curves, ¯εk
versus k, reﬂecting that the quasiparticles are similar to
free electrons, but weighted by the electron quasiparti-
cle coherent weight ZF. In other words, the form of the
electron spectral function in Eq. (9) is similar to that
obtained in the MF approximation, and then EFS is nec-
essarily a surface in momentum-space on which the elec-
tron lifetime becomes inﬁnitely long in the limit as one
approaches EFS. In Fig. 1, we plot a map of the spec-
tral intensity A(k, 0) in Eq. (9) at the doping levels (a)
δ = 0.32, (b) δ = 0.40, and (c) δ = 0.45 with temperature
T = 0.001J in the hexagonal BZ, where the calculated
EFS forms a continuous contour in momentum space, and
then the EFS location agrees with a large EFS observed
from the ARPES experiments12–20. In particular, EFS
has a hexagonal shape at the low doping, and exhibits
nearly straight sections perpendicular to the high sym-
metry directions. However, this hexagonal character at
the low-doped regime weakens with the increase of dop-
ing. To see the low-energy excitations more clearly, we
plot A(k, 0) in the [kx, ky] plane at δ = 0.32 in Fig. 1d,
where we see that the peaks with the same height dis-
tribute uniformly along the hexagonal EFS, and then a
large EFS is formed as a closed contour of the gapless
excitations in momentum space, i.e., the electron spec-
trum is gapped everywhere except on EFS. Moreover, ac-
cording to one of the self-consistent equations (8), EFS
with the area contains 1 + δ electrons, and therefore is
consistent with that predicted by the Luttinger’s theo-
rem. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1e, the area of the
hexagonal EFS increases with the increase of the dop-
ing concentration, in good agreement with the ARPES
experimental results12–20.

B. Fermi arcs induced by electron self-energy

Now we turn to discuss the eﬀect of the energy and
momentum dependence of Σ1(k, ω) on EFS in the cobal-
tates. In this case, the electron spectral function can be
evaluated directly from the electron Green’s function (1)
as,

A(k, ω) =

2|ImΣ1(k, ω)|

[ω − εk − ReΣ1(k, ω)]2 + [ImΣ1(k, ω)]2 , (10)

where ImΣ1(k, ω) and ReΣ1(k, ω) are the corresponding
imaginary and real parts of Σ1(k, ω) in Eq. (6), respec-
tively. Since the strong coupling of electrons and spin
excitations is considered in the electron spectral function
(10), the electron quasiparticle energies are renormalized,
therefore the electron quasiparticles acquire a ﬁnite life-
time and the incoherent side band develops. In Fig. 2a,
we plot a map of the spectral intensity A(k, 0) in Eq. (10)
at δ = 0.32 with T = 0.001J. Comparing it with Fig. 1a
for the same set of parameters except for the eﬀect from
the momentum and energy dependence of Σ1(k, ω), we
see that the Fermi arcs emerge, where EFS around the
region along the Γ-K direction has been suppressed by
Σ1(k, ω), leaving behind six disconnected Fermi arcs cen-
tered around the region of EFS along the Γ-M direction.

To see this Fermi-arc phenomenon more clearly, we plot
A(k, 0) in the [kx, ky] plane at δ = 0.32 in Fig. 2b, where
the location of the hot spot, marked by the black cir-
cle, is thus determined by the highest peak height on the
Fermi arc. Our result in Fig. 2b shows that the Fermi
arc spreads around the hot spot, while these hot spots
on the Fermi arcs, reﬂecting a strong charge ﬂuctuation,
connected by the wave vector contribute eﬀectively to
the electron quasiparticle scattering process. However,
this Fermi-arc phenomenon weakens with the increase of
doping, which leads to a crossover from the strong charge
ﬂuctuation at the low-doped regime to the weak charge
ﬂuctuation at the high-doped regime. In order to show
this crossover clearly, we plot A(k, 0) in the [kx, ky] plane
at δ = 0.40 in Fig. 2c. Comparing it with Fig. 2b for
the same set of parameters except for doping, we ﬁnd
that EFS around the region along the Γ-K direction is
reduced very slightly, and then the weight of the hot spot
on the Fermi arc at δ = 0.40 is much smaller than that
at δ = 0.32.

The cobaltates have a triangular lattice, where the
spin conﬁguration arrangement makes it impossible to
minimize the energy on all spins on the lattice sites
at the same time - a situation known as the geomet-
rical spin frustration. However, this triangular-lattice
structure induces possibly a geometrical construct for
120◦-type collective instability. In particular, the earlier
calculation45 based on the extended Hubbard model on
a triangular lattice has predicted that the NN repulsion
can drive the commensurate
3 charge-order state
near the commensurate doping δ = 1/3. This
3
charge order arises from weak spatial modulations of the
charge density, and therefore is closely related to the low-
energy electronic structure.
In particular, the ARPES
experiments15,17 have provided the evidence to support
this prediction. In our present study, although the NN
√
repulsion is not included in the t-J model, BZ of the
3 charge order near the commensurate doping
δ = 1/3 coincides with the topology of our calculated
EFS. In this case, it is also possible that the

hind six disconnected segments around the region along
the Γ-M direction.

C. Electron momentum distribution

A quantity which is closely related to the electron spec-
tral function (10) is the electron momentum distribution,

(cid:90) ∞

nkσ =

dω
2π

nF(ω)A(k, ω).

(11)

In Fig. 3a, we plot a map of nkσ indicating a shape of the
hexagonal EFS in the BZ at δ = 0.32 with T = 0.001J,
where the identiﬁcation of a large hexagonal EFS is un-
ambiguous. To further analyze the nature of EFS, we
plot nkσ along the Γ-M direction in Fig. 3b. It is shown
clearly that the shape of the electron momentum distri-
bution in the cobaltates is a should-be electron momen-
tum distribution, i.e., in some part (below the electron
Fermi energy) the distribution in the presence of the in-
teraction is closer to 1, while in other part (above the
electron Fermi energy) it is approximately closer to zero.
In particular, although the line shape in Fig. 3b itself
is strongly dependent on the interaction, the integrated
area under the curve is equal to 1 + δ, and therefore the
underlying EFS still fulﬁlls Luttinger’s theorem, which
follows a fact that this integrated area is independence
of the interaction.

distribution in the Brillouin zone at δ = 0.32 with T = 0.001J
for t/J = 1.5 and t(cid:48)/t = 0.2. (b) The electron-momentum
distribution along the Γ-M direction.

The essential physics of the electron quasiparticle ex-
citations in the cobaltates is the same as in the case of
the cuprates27 except for the geometric construct, and
can be also attributed to the energy and momentum de-
pendence of the electron self-energy Σ1(k, ω) in Eq. (2).
EFS is determined directly by εk + ReΣ1(k, 0) = 0 in
the electron spectral function A(k, ω) in Eq. (10) at zero
energy, and then the lifetime of the electron quasiparti-
cle at EFS is determined by the inverse of the imaginary
part of the electron self-energy 1/|ImΣ1(kF, 0)|. In Fig.
4a, we map the intensity of |ImΣ1(kF, 0)| at δ = 0.32
with T = 0.001J, where ImΣ1(kF, 0) is strongly mo-
mentum dependent. To see this point clearly, we plot
|ImΣ1(kF, 0)| in the [kx, ky] plane in Fig.
4b, where
|ImΣ1(kF, 0)| has a strong angular dependence with ac-
tual maximums around the region at EFS along the Γ-K
direction, which leads to that the part of EFS around the

T = 0.001J for t/J = 1.5 and t(cid:48)/t = 0.2. (b) |ImΣ1(kF, 0)| in
the [kx, ky] plane.

In the framework of the fermion-spin theory, the in-
teraction between electrons by the exchange of spin ex-
citations induces the electron self-energy Σ1(k, ω). As in
the cuprates27,46, Σ1(k, ω) in the cobaltates is also di-
rectly related to the pseudogap ¯∆PG(k) as Σ1(k, ω) ≈
[ ¯∆PG(k)]2/(ω + ε0k). This pseudogap is therefore iden-
tiﬁed as being a region of the electron self-energy eﬀect
in which the pseudogap suppresses the low-energy spec-
tral weight of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum. In
other words, the Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped
regime is manifested within the pseudogap regime, then
the Fermi arcs and pseudogap in the cobaltates are inti-
mately related each other, and they have a root in com-
mon originated from the electron self-energy Σ1(k, ω).
However, due to the presence of the geometric spin frus-
tration, the strength of the interaction between electrons
by the exchange of spin excitations in the cobaltates is
much weaker than that in the cuprates, which leads to
the pseudogap parameter ¯∆PG in the cobaltates is much
smaller than that in the cuprates. As a consequence,
the Fermi-arc phenomenon in the cobaltates even at the
low-doped regime is not particularly obvious than that
in the cuprates. On the other hand, ¯∆PG has the same
doping dependence as that discussed previously in the
case of the cuprates27,46, i.e., the pseudogap state is rel-
atively obvious at the low-doped regime, and then ¯∆PG
smoothly decreases upon increasing doping. This doping
dependence of ¯∆PG therefore leads to that the Fermi-arc
phenomenon in the cobaltates at the low-doped regime
weakens with the increase of doping.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Within the t-J model on a triangular lattice, we have
discussed the nature of EFS in the cobaltates, and quali-
tatively reproduce the essential feature of the evolution of
EFS with doping. Our results show that the underlying
hexagonal EFS satisﬁes Luttinger’s theorem. Our theory
also predicts a Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped
regime, where the region of the hexagonal EFS along
the Γ-K direction is gapped by the pseudogap, and then
six disconnected Fermi arcs located at the region of the
hexagonal EFS along the Γ-M direction appear, which

(a)(a)(cid:140)(b)should be veriﬁed by further experiments.
In particu-
lar, this Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime
weakens with the increase of doping. Incorporating the
present result with that obtained in the cuprates, it is
thus shown that as a natural consequence of the strong
electron correlation, the Fermi-arc phenomenon may be a
universal phenomenon in a doped Mott insulator in spite
of the existence of a geometrical construct or not.
