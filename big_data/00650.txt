LIMITS OF SEQUENCES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS DEPENDING ON

FINITELY MANY COORDINATES

OLENA KARLOVA AND VOLODYMYR MYKHAYLYUK

Abstract. We answer two questions from V.Bykov, On Baire class one functions on a product
space, Topol. Appl. 199 (2016) 55–62, and prove that every Baire one function on a subspace of a
countable perfectly normal product is the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions, each
depending on ﬁnitely many coordinates. It is proved also that a lower semicontinuous function on
a subspace of a countable perfectly normal product is the pointwise limit of an increasing sequence
of continuous functions, each depending on ﬁnitely many coordinates, if and only if the function
has a minorant which depends on ﬁnitely many coordinates.

1. Introduction

The collection of all continuous maps between topological spaces X and Y is denoted by
If A ⊆ Y X, then we denote the family of all pointwise limits of sequences of maps
. We say that a subset A of a topological space X is functionally Fσ (Gδ), if it is a

C(X, Y ).
from A by A
union (an intersection) of a sequence of functionally closed (functionally open) sets in X.

p

Recall that a map f : X → Y belongs to the ﬁrst Lebesgue class, if the preimage f −1(V ) of each
open set V ⊆ Y is an Fσ-set in X, and belongs to the ﬁrst Baire class, if f ∈ C(X, Y )
. We denote
the collection of all Lebesgue one maps and Baire one maps between X and Y by H1(X, Y ) and
B1(X, Y ), respectively. If a Lebesgue (Baire) one map f : X → Y takes ﬁnitely many values, then
we say that f ∈ H0
1(X, Y ) (B0
1(X, Y )). Let us observe that H1(X, R) = B1(X, R) for a perfectly
normal space X (see [7, §31]).

p

Properties of functions deﬁned on products of topological spaces are tightly connected with the
dependence of such functions on some sets of coordinates. The dependence of continuous mappings
on some sets of coordinates was investigated by many mathematicians (see, for instance [8], [2],
[10] and the literature given there). However, the dependence on countably many coordinates
serves as a convenient tool for the investigation of Namioka property of separately continuous
maps and their analogs [9]. Functions depending locally on ﬁnitely many coordinates plays an
important role in the theory of smoothness and renorming on Banach spaces [3].

Let (Xn)∞

n=1 be a sequence of topological spaces, P =Q∞

n=1 Xn and a = (an)n∈N ∈ P be a point.
For every n ∈ N and x ∈ P we put pn(x) = (x1, . . . , xn, an+1, an+2, . . . ). We say that a set A ⊆ P
depends on ﬁnitely many coordinates, if there exists n ∈ N such that for all x ∈ A and y ∈ P
the equality pn(x) = pn(y) implies y ∈ A. A map f : X → Y deﬁned on a subspace X ⊆ P is
ﬁnitely determined if it depends on ﬁnitely many coordinates, i.e., f (x) = f (y) for all x, y ∈ X
with pn(x) = pn(y). We denote by CF(X, Y ) the set of all continuous ﬁnitely determined maps
between X and Y ; we write CF(X) for CF(X, R).

Vladimir Bykov in his recent paper [1] proved the following results.

Theorem A. Let X be a subspace of a product P =Q∞

Then

n=1 Xn of a sequence of metric spaces Xn.

(1) every Baire class one function f : X → R is the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions

in CF(X);

(2) a lower semicontinuous function f : X → R is the pointwise limit of an increasing sequence

of functions from CF(X) if and only if f has a minorant in CF(X).

The following questions were formulated in [1]:

OLENA KARLOVA AND VOLODYMYR MYKHAYLYUK

Question 1. [1, Remark 1] Does the conclusion (1) of Theorem A holds for an arbitrary completely
regular space X?

Question 2. [1, Remark 2] Does the conclusion (2) of Theorem A holds for an arbitrary perfectly
normal space X?

We show that that the answer on Question 1 is negative (see Theorem 16). We prove that
every Lebesgue one function f : X → Y is a pointwise limit of a sequence of functions from
CF(X, Y ) if Y is a path-connected separable metric R-space (in particular, a convex subset of
a normed separable space) and one of the following properties holds: X is a Lindel¨of subspace
of a completely regular product P , or X is a subspace of perfectly normal P (see Theorem 8),
or X = P and P is pseudocompact (see Theorem 13). Theorem 9 gives the positive answer on
Question 2.

2. Approximation of functions with finitely many values

Let X be a topological space. For a countable family F = (fn : n ∈ N) of continuous functions

fn : X → [0, 1] we put

∞

(2.1)

dF (x, y) =

1
2n |fn(x) − fn(y)|

Xn=1

for all x, y ∈ X. Then dF is a pseudometric on X such that every continuous function f :
(X, dF ) → Y is continuous on X in the initial topology for any topological space Y .

G be a functionally open set in X. If one of the following conditions holds:

n=1 Xn be a product of completely regular spaces, X be a subspace of P and

Lemma 1. Let P =Q∞

(1) P is perfectly normal, or
(2) X is Lindel¨of,

then

(a) there exists an increasing sequence of functions fn ∈ CF(P, [0, 1]) such that the character-

istic function χG : X → [0, 1] is a pointwise limit of the sequence (fn|X)∞

n=1;

(b) there exists a countable family F of functions from CF(P, [0, 1]) such that G is open in

(X, dF ).

Proof. (a). Let ˜G be an open set in P such that G = X ∩ ˜G. Take a family (Ws : s ∈ S) of basic
functionally open sets in P such that

Notice that G is an Fσ-set in X. Consequently, G is Lindel¨of in case (2) and we choose at most

Ws.

˜G = [s∈S

countable set S0 ⊆ S such that G ⊆Ss∈S0 Ws. Let us observe that G = (Ss∈S0 Ws) ∩ X.

Denote T = S in case (1) and T = S0 in case (2). For every k ∈ N we put

Tk = {s ∈ T : Ws depends on the ﬁrst k coordinates},

Ws.

Uk = [s∈Tk

Then Uk depends on the ﬁrst k coordinates and Uk ⊆ Uk+1 for every k ∈ N. Since for every k ∈ N
the set Uk is functionally open in P , there exist sequences (Fk,n)∞
n=1 of functionally
closed and functionally open subsets of P , respectively, such that each of these sets depends on
the ﬁrst k coordinates,

n=1 and (Gk,n)∞

Uk =

For all n ∈ N we set

Then the set An is functionally closed, the set Bn is functionally open, each of them depends on

ﬁnitely many coordinates and An ⊆ Bn ⊆ An+1 for every n. Moreover, G = (S∞

choose a function fn ∈ CF(P, [0, 1]) such that

An = f −1

n (1)

and P \ Bn = f −1

n (0)

for every n. Then fn(x) ≤ fn+1(x) for all n ∈ N and x ∈ P . Moreover, limn→∞ fn(x) = χG(x) for
every x ∈ X.

(b). We put F = (fn : n ∈ N), where (fn)∞

n=1 is the sequence constructed in (a). Since
each function fn is continuous on (P, dF), the function χG is lower semicontinuous on (X, dF ).
Therefore, G is open in (X, dF ).
(cid:3)

Proposition 2. Let P =Q∞

n=1 Xn be a product of completely regular spaces, X be a subspace of P
and A be a functionally Fσ- and functionally Gδ-set in X simultaneously. If one of the following
conditions holds:

(1) P is perfectly normal, or
(2) X is Lindel¨of,

then χA ∈ CF(X, [0, 1])

|hk(pk(x)) − hk(x)| ≤ lim

dF(pk(x), x)

we have

lim

fk(x) = χA(x).

The continuity of fk on (X, dF ) implies the continuity of fk on X with the product topology
induced from P . Hence, χA ∈ CF(X)

Remark 1. It follows from [6, Proposition 2.6] that for every map f ∈ H1(X, Y ) the preimage
f −1(V ) of any open set V ⊆ Y is functionally Fσ in X, if X is a normal space and Y is a
metrizable space.

3. R-spaces and uniform limits

For a family (fs : s ∈ S) of maps between topological spaces X and Y we deﬁne a map

∆s∈S fs : X → Y S as the following:

for every x ∈ X. We say that F is ∆-closed, if

fs(x) = (fs(x))s∈S

∆
s∈S

f ◦ ( ∆
s∈S

fs) ∈ F

for any ﬁnite set {fs : s ∈ S} ⊆ F and a continuous map f : Y S → Y .

A metric space (Y, d) is said to be an R-space [5], if for every ε > 0 there exists a continuous

map rε : Y × Y → Y with the following properties:

(3.1)

(3.2)

d(y, z) ≤ ε =⇒ rε(y, z) = y,

d(rε(y, z), z) ≤ ε

for all y, z ∈ Y . Let us observe that every convex subset Y of a normed space (Z, k · k) equipped
with the metric induced from (Z, k · k) is an R-space, where the map rε is deﬁned as rε(y, z) =
z + (ε/ky − zk) · (y − z), if ky − zk > ε, and rε(y, z) = y, otherwise.

Theorem 4. Let X be a topological space, (Y, d) be an R-space and F be a ∆-closed family of
maps between X and Y . Then the family F

is closed under uniform limits.

Proof. Let (rn)∞

n=1 be a sequence of continuous functions rn : Y × Y → Y such that

d(y, z) ≤

which is convergent to a map f : X → Y

uniformly on X. Without loss of generality we may assume that

for all n ∈ N and x ∈ X. For every n we take a sequence of maps gn,m : X → Y such that

d(fn(x), fn+1(x)) ≤

lim
m→∞

gn,m(x) = fn(x) ∀x ∈ X,

gn,m ∈ F ∀m, n ∈ N.

For all x ∈ X and m ∈ N let

ϕ1,m(x) = g1,m(x)

and ϕn,m(x) = rn−1(gn,m(x), ϕn−1,m(x))

for n > 1.

Then ϕn,m ∈ F for all n, m, since F is ∆-closed. Moreover, the inequality

holds for all n ∈ N and x ∈ X.

d(ϕn+1,m(x), ϕn,m(x)) ≤

We claim that the sequence (ϕn,m)∞

m=1 converges to fn pointwisely on X for every n. Indeed, ﬁx
x ∈ X and show that for every n ∈ N there exists a number mn such that ϕn,m(x) = gn,m(x) for
all m ≥ mn. For n = 1 the statement is evident. Suppose that n > 1 and ϕn−1,m(x) = gn−1,m(x)
for m ≥ mn−1. Since (gn,m(x))∞
m=1 converges to fn−1(x),
there exists a number m0 such that

m=1 converges to fn(x) and (gn−1,m(x))∞

Finally, we prove that limm→∞ ϕm,m(x) = f (x). Fix ε > 0 and take n0 ∈ N such that

(cid:3)

We will use the following statement from [4] (see also [7, §31.VIII, Theorem 3] for metrizable

domains).

Lemma 5. Let X be a normal space and Y be a metric separable space. Then every map f ∈
H1(X, Y ) is a limit of uniformly convergent sequence of functions fn ∈ H1(X, Y ) with countable
discrete image fn(X) for every n ∈ N. If, moreover, Y is completely bounded, we may assume
that each function fn takes ﬁnitely many values.

4. Approximation of maps with path-connected range

Lemma 6. Let P and X be as in Proposition 2 and let f ∈ H1(X, R) has a discrete countable
image f (X). Then f ∈ CF(X)

.

p

Proof. We consider a homeomorphism ϕ : R → (0, 1) and the function ϕ ◦ f : X → (0, 1) of the
ﬁrst Lebesgue class. By Lemma 5 we choose a sequence (gn)∞
1(X, (0, 1))
which is convergent to ϕ ◦ f uniformly on X. Since gn ∈ CF(X, (0, 1))
according to Corollary 3
for every n ∈ N and the space Y = (0, 1) with the metric d(x, y) = |x − y| is an R-space,

Proposition 7. Let P and X be as in Proposition 2 and let Y be a path-connected space. Then
every Lebesgue one function f : X → Y with countable discrete image f (X) is a pointwise limit
of a sequence of functions from CF(X, Y ).

Proof. Let f ∈ H1(X, Y ) and f (X) = {yn : n ∈ N}, yn ≥ ym for n ≥ m. For every n ∈ N we take
a continuous map γn : [n, n + 1] → Y such that γn(n) = yn and γn(n + 1) = yn+1. Now we deﬁne
a continuous map γ : [1, +∞) → Y such that γ|[n,n+1] = γn for every n ∈ N. Notice that every
set An = f −1(yn) is functionally Fσ in X and the family (An : n ∈ N) forms a partition of X. We
put g(x) = n if x ∈ An for some n ∈ N. Then g ∈ H1(X, [1, +∞)) and the space g(X) is discrete

and countable. By Lemma 6 there exists a sequence of functions gm ∈ CF(X) which is convergent
to g pointwisely on X. Let us deﬁne functions fm ∈ CF(X, Y ) by the formula fm = γ ◦ gm for
m ∈ N. It remains to notice that for every x ∈ X there exists n ∈ N such that x ∈ An, therefore,
limm→∞ fm(x) = γ(g(x)) = γ(n) = yn = f (x).

Theorem 8. Let P and X be as in Proposition 2 and (Y, d) be a path-connected separable R-space.
Then every Lebesgue one function f : X → Y is a pointwise limit of a sequence of functions from
CF(X, Y ).

Proof. Let f ∈ H1(X, Y ). According to Lemma 5 there exists a sequence of functions fn ∈
H1(X, Y ) with discrete countable image which is convergent to f uniformly on X. Then fn ∈

5. Semicontinuous functions

Theorem 9. Let P and X be as in Proposition 2 and let f : X → [0, +∞) be a lower
semicontinuous function. Then f is a pointwise limit of an increasing sequence of functions
fn ∈ CF(X, [0, +∞)).

Proof. Let Q = {qn : n ∈ N} and Bn = (qn, +∞). Since f is lower semicontinuous, every set
Gn = f −1(Bn) is open in X. Lemma 1 implies the existence of countable family F = (fn : n ∈ N)
of functions fn ∈ CF(P, [0, 1]) such that every set Gn is open in (X, dF ). Moreover, for every a ≥ 0
there exists a sequence (nk)∞
k=1 Gnk. Then f −1(a, +∞) is open in
(X, dF ). Therefore, f : (X, dF ) → [0, +∞) is lower semicontinuous.

k=1 such that f −1(a, +∞) = S∞

For all n ∈ N and x, y ∈ P we put

dn(x, y) =

2n .

For all n ∈ N and x ∈ X let

gn(x) = inf
z∈X

(f (z) + ndn(x, z)).

Then gn depends on the ﬁrst n coordinates, since for every ﬁxed z ∈ X the function dn(x, z)
depends on on the ﬁrst n coordinates. Moreover, gn(x) ≤ f (x) for every x ∈ X.

Fix n ∈ N and notice that the inequalities

|gn(x) − gn(y)| ≤ sup
z∈X

|ndn(x, z) − ndn(y, z)| ≤ ndn(x, y) ≤ ndF (x, y)

for all x, y ∈ X imply that gn is uniformly continuous on (X, dF ).

It follows from (5.1) that the sequence (gn)∞
It remains to verify that limn→∞ gn(x) = f (x) for every x ∈ X. Fix x ∈ X and ε > 0. Take a

sequence (zn)∞

n=1 of points from X with

f (zn) + ndn(x, zn) < gn(x) + ε.

Taking into account that gn(x) ≤ f (x) for every n and f (zn) ≥ 0, we get limn→∞ dn(x, zn) = 0.
Then limn→∞ dF (x, zn) = 0. Since f is lower semicontinuous on (X, dF ) at the point x, there
exists a number k such that f (zn) ≥ f (x) − ε for all n ≥ k. Then gn(x) > f (zn) − ε > f (x) − 2ε
for all n ≥ k.
(cid:3)

Corollary 10. Let P and X be as in Proposition 2 and let f : X → R be a lower semicontinuous
function. Then f is a pointwise limit of an increasing sequence of functions from CF(X) if and
only if f has a minorant from CF(X).

LIMITS OF SEQUENCES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS DEPENDING ON FINITELY MANY COORDINATES7

Proof. Since the necessity is obvious, we will prove the suﬃciency. Assume that g ∈ CF(X) is
a minorant for f and put h = f − g. Applying Theorem 9 for the function h : X → [0, +∞),
we obtain the increasing sequence of functions hn ∈ CF(X, [0, +∞)) which is convergent to h
pointwisely on X. It remains to put fn = hn + g for every n ∈ N.
(cid:3)

6. Pseudocompact case

We say that a sequence (fn)∞

n=1 of maps fn : X → Y between topological spaces X and Y is
stably convergent to a map f : X → Y on X, if for every x ∈ X there exists k ∈ N such that
fn(x) = f (x) for all n ≥ k.

Lemma 11. Let f : X → Y be a map between a topological space X and a metric space (Y, dY ),
(fn)∞
n=1 be a sequence of maps fn : X → Y which is convergent to f stably on X and let (fn,k)∞
k=1
be a sequence of maps fn,k : X → Y which is convergent to fn uniformly on X for every n ∈ N.
Then f ∈ {fn,k : n, k ∈ N}

.

p

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that

dY (fn,k(x), fn(x)) <

1
2k ,
1
dY (fn,k+1(x), fn,k(x)) <
2k

for all x ∈ X and n, k ∈ N.

Fix x ∈ X and ε > 0. We choose m ∈ N such that

1
2m−3 < ε and fn(x) = f (x) ∀n ≥ m.

Then we get

n−1

dY (fn,k+1(x), fn,k(x)) + dY (fn,m(x), fn(x)) <

for all n ≥ m. Therefore,

fn,n(x) = f (x).

(cid:3)

Lemma 12. Let P =Q∞

n=1 Xn be a pseudocompact space and (Y, dY ) be a path-connected metric
space. Then every Baire one function f : X → Y with countable discrete image f (X) is a
pointwise limit of a sequence of functions from CF(X, Y ).

Proof. It follows from [5, Lemma 4] that there exists a sequence (fn)∞
n=1 of continuous functions
fn : P → Y which is stably convergent to f on P . By [1, Theorem 1] every function fn is the
uniform limit of a sequence from CF(P, Y ). It remains to apply Lemma 11.
(cid:3)

Theorem 13. Let P =Q∞

n=1 Xn be a pseudocompact space and (Y, dY ) be a path-connected sepa-
rable metric R-space. Then every Baire one function f : P → Y is a pointwise limit of a sequence
of functions from CF(P, Y ).

Proof. Let f ∈ B1(P, Y ).
It follows from [4, Lemma 3.3] and [5, Lemma 4] that there exists
a sequence of functions fn ∈ B1(P, Y ) with discrete countable image f (P ) which is uniformly
convergent to f . Then fn ∈ CF(P, Y )
for every n by Lemma 12. Since the family CF(P, Y ) is
∆-closed, f ∈ CF(P, Y )

by mξ an integer mξ ∈ N such that Fξ ⊆ Cmξ. By transﬁnite induction on ξ we construct a family
((Aξ,n)∞
n=1 of ﬁnite sets Aξ,n ⊆ C which satisﬁes the following
conditions:

n=1 : 1 ≤ ξ < c) of sequences (Aξ,n)∞

(a) Aξ,n ∩ Aθ,m = ∅ for (ξ, n) 6= (θ, m);
(b) (Aξ,n)mξ ∩ Fξ 6= ∅ for every ξ < c and n ∈ N.
Assume that 1 ≤ α < c and the family ((Aξ,n)∞

n=1 : 1 ≤ ξ < α) is constructed. We put

Bα = [1≤ξ<α

[n=1

Clearly, |Bα| < c. Since rmα(Fα) = c, we can construct easily by the induction on n a sequence
(Aα,n)∞
n=1 of disjoint ﬁnite sets Aα,n ⊆ C \ Bα such that (Aα,n)mα ∩ Fα 6= ∅ for every n ∈ N. It
remains to put

Lemma 15. There exists a function g : C → R of the second Baire class such that for every
countable set A ⊆ C the restriction g|C\A is not a function of the ﬁrst Baire class.

Proof. Let µ be the Lebesgue measure on [0, 1]. We prove the statement for a function g : X → R
deﬁned on a Cantor type closed set X ⊆ [0, 1] which is homeomorphic to C and µ(G) > 0 for
every open set G ⊆ X.

We choose an Fσ-set B of the ﬁrst category in X such that µ(B) = µ(X) and put g = χ|B.
Since B is Fσ, the function g belongs to the second Baire class. Moreover, for every countable set

A ⊆ X the function g|X\A is everywhere discontinuous. Therefore, the restriction g|X\A is not a
Baire one function, because the space X \ A is Baire.

Theorem 16. There exist a sequence (Xn)∞
R of the ﬁrst Baire class such that

n=1 of Lindel¨of spaces Xn and a function f :Q∞

n=1 Xn →

(i) for every n ∈ N the product Yn =Qn

(ii) f is not a pointwise limit of any sequence (fn)∞

k=1 Xk is Lindel¨of;

Proof. Let (An)∞
n=1 be a sequence of sets An ⊆ C which satisfy conditions (1) and (2) of Lemma
14. Let τ0 be the usual topology of the Cantor set C. For every n ∈ N we denote by τn the
topology on C with the base

n=1 of functions from CF(Q∞

n=1 Xn).

τ0 ∪ {{x} : x ∈ An}.

Put Xn = (C, τn) for every n ∈ N.

(i). Fix n ∈ N and put Bn = Sn

on C with the base

τ0 ∪ {{x} : x ∈ Bn}.

k=1 Ak. Consider the space Z = (C, σ), where σ is a topology

According to [11, Fact 6, p. 126], the space Z n is Lindel¨of. Since the topology of the product Yn
is weaker than the topology of Z n, Yn is Lindel¨of too.

(ii). We start with auxiliary properties of functions on the space X =Q∞

Claim A. For every function v : C → R of the ﬁrst Baire class there exists a continuous function

u : X → R such that u(a, a, . . . ) = v(a) for every a ∈ C.

n=1 Xn.

Proof of Claim A. Choose a sequence (vn)∞

n=1 of continuous functions vn : C → R which
converges to v pointwisely on C. Using the uniform continuity of the functions vn, we choose a
strictly decreasing sequence of reals δn > 0 such that |vn(x′) − vn(x′′)| < 1
n for every n ∈ N and
x′, x′′ ∈ C with |x′ − x′′| < δn. For every n ∈ N we put

Gn = {(xk)∞

k=1 ∈ X : max{|xi − xj| : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} < δn}

and

Fn = {(xk)∞

k=1 ∈ X : max{|xi − xj| : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} ≤ δn}.

It is evident that every set Gn is open and every set Fn is closed in Cω. We put v0(x) = 0 for
every x ∈ C and

∆ = {(x, x, . . . ) : x ∈ C}.

For every n ∈ N we choose a continuous function ϕn : Cω → [0, 1] such that ϕn(X \ Gn) ⊆ {1}
and ϕn(Fn+1) ⊆ {0} and consider the function u : X → R,

v0(x),
ϕn(x)vn−1(x1) + (1 − ϕn(x)vn(x1), x = (x1, x2, . . . ) ∈ Fn \ Fn+1
v(a),

x = (a, a, . . . ) ∈ ∆.

x ∈ X \ F1

u(x) =


It easy to see that the function u is continuous at every point x ∈ X \ ∆. It remains to verify the
continuity of u at every point x ∈ ∆. Fix a ∈ C and ε > 0. We choose m ∈ N such that a ∈ Am
and let n0 ≥ max{m, 2
2 for all n ≥ n0 − 1. Now we consider
the neighborhood

ε + 1} be such that |vn(a) − v(a)| < ε

U = {(xn)∞

n=1 ∈ X : xm = a and max{|xi − xj| : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n0} ≤ δn0}

of the point x0 = (a, a, . . . ) in X. Fix x = (xn)∞
x ∈ Fk \ Fk+1. Notice that k ≥ n0, because U ⊆ Fn0. Therefore,

n=1 ∈ U \ {x0} and take k ∈ N such that

|vk(a) − v(a)| <

ε
2

and |vk−1(a) − v(a)| <

ε

.

Since xm = a, |x1 − a| < δk and, moreover |x1 − a| < δk−1. Therefore,

|vk(x1) − vk(a)| < 1

k ≤ 1

n0

and

Thus,

Now we have

OLENA KARLOVA AND VOLODYMYR MYKHAYLYUK

|vk−1(x1) − vk−1(a)| < 1

k−1 ≤ 1

n0−1 ≤ ε
2.

|vk(x1) − v(a)| < ε

and |vk−1(a) − v(a)| < ε.

|u(x) − v(a)| = |ϕk(x)(vk−1(x1) − v(a)) + (1 − ϕk(x)(vk(x1) − v(a)| ≤

ϕk(x)|vk−1(x1) − v(a)| + (1 − ϕk(x)|vk(x1) − v(a)| < ϕk(x)ε + (1 − ϕk(x)ε = ε.

Claim B. For every function w : C → R of the second Baire class the function h : X → R

h(x) =(cid:26) 0,

x ∈ X \ ∆

w(a), x = (a, a, a, . . . ) ∈ ∆

is a function of the ﬁrst Baire class.

Proof of Claim B. We choose a sequence (wn)∞

n=1 of Baire one functions wn : C → R which
converges to w pointwisely on C. By Claim A we can construct a sequence (hn)∞
n=1 of continuous
functions hn : X → R such that hn(a, a, . . . ) = wn(a) for all a ∈ X and hn(x) = 0 for all n ∈ N
and x ∈ X \ Cn, where

Cn = {(xk)∞

k=1 ∈ X : max{|xi − xj| : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} ≤ 1

n }.

Clearly, the sequence (hn)∞

n=1 converges to h pointwisely on X.

Now we prove the condition (ii). Lemma 15 implies the existence of a function g : C → R
of the second Baire class such that for every countable set A ⊆ C the restriction g|C\A does not
belong to the ﬁrst Baire class. According to Claim B, the function f : X → R

f (x) =(cid:26) 0,

x ∈ X \ ∆

g(a), x = (a, a, a, . . . ) ∈ ∆

is a function of the ﬁrst Baire class.

Now we show that (ii) holds. Suppose to the contrary that f is the pointwise limit of a sequence
of functions fn ∈ CF(X). Without loss of generality we may assume that for every n ∈ N the
function fn depends on the ﬁrst n coordinates. For every n ∈ N and z ∈ C we put

gn(z) = fn(z, z, . . . ).

n=1 of topological
spaces Xn and for a continuous map f : X → Y with values in a topological space Y there exists
a sequence (fn)∞

n=1 of functions fn ∈ CF(X, Y ) which converges to f pointwisely on X.

n=1 Xn of a sequence (Xn)∞

n=1 Dn is at most countable, every function gn is continuous at each point
n=1 converges to g pointwisely on C, which contradicts to the
(cid:3)

Fix n ∈ N. Since fn depends on the ﬁrst n coordinates, the function gn : C → R is continuous at
k=1 Ak). It follows from condition (2) of Lemma 14 that every closed set
k=1 Ak is at most countable. Therefore, an Fσ-set Dn of all discontinuity points of fn is at

every point z ∈ C \ (Sn
F ⊆Sn
Hence, the set D =S∞

n=1 of topological spaces Xn from Theorem 16, for the subspace X =
∆ and f ∈ CF(X) with f (x, x, . . . ) = g(x), there does not exist a sequence of functions fn :

n=1 Xn → R such that the sequence of the restrictions fn|X converges to f pointwisely.
