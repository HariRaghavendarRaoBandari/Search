Robust Mechanisms under Common Valuation

Preliminary

March 22, 2016

Abstract

We study robust mechanisms to sell a common-value good. We assume the mecha-

nism designer knows the prior distribution of the buyers’ common value but is unsure

about the buyers’ information structure. We use linear programming duality to derive

mechanisms that guarantee a good revenue among all information structures and all

equilibria.

Introduction

In this paper we study robust mechanism design for selling a common-value good. A robust
mechanism is one that works well under a variety of circumstances, in particular under weak
assumptions about participants’ information structure. The goal of robust mechanism design

is to reduce the “base of common knowledge required to conduct useful analyses of practical
problems,” as envisioned by Wilson (1987).

The literature on robust mechanism design has so far largely focused on private value
settings.1 Common value is of course important in many real-life markets (particularly
ﬁnancial markets) and has a long tradition in auction theory. Robustness with respect to

information structure is especially relevant in a common-value setting, since it is hard in
practice to pinpoint exactly what is a signal (or a set of signals) for a participant and to

anisms.

quantify the correlation between the signal and the common value, not to mention specifying
the joint distribution of signals for all participants that correctly captures their beliefs and
higher order beliefs about the common value.

We are inspired by a recent paper of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (2015) which,
among other results, shows that in a ﬁrst price auction of a common value good and for

a ﬁxed prior distribution of value, there is a strictly positive lower bound such that for
any information/signal structure that is consistent with the prior the equilibrium revenue is
always above that lower bound. For example, if there are two buyers and a uniform [0, 1]

prior distribution for the common value, then the seller can guarantee a minimum revenue
of 1/6 for any information structure consistent with the prior and any equilibrium from the

information structure. Notice that the maximum revenue that the seller can possibly achieve
in equilibrium is 1/2 which is the expected common value, so the minimum revenue guar-
antee of 1/6 is already 33% of the best case scenario. This is quite an attractive prospect

for a ambiguity averse seller (in the sense of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)) who has large
uncertainty about buyers’ information structure.

The natural followup question is whether we can achieve an even better revenue guar-
antee with alternative mechanisms. To answer this question we take a max-min approach,
where we ﬁrst minimize the revenue over the set of information structure and equilibrium for

a given mechanism, and then maximize the minimized revenue over the set of mechanisms.
Bergemann and Morris (2016) points out that we can combine information structure and
equilibrium into a single entity called Bayes Correlated Equilibrium, which is a joint distri-

bution over actions and value subject to incentive and consistency constraints. We note that
minimizing revenue over Bayes correlated equilibrium for any ﬁxed mechanism is a linear

programming problem, and we can equivalently solve the dual of that problem which is a
maximization problem over the dual variables of constraints associated with Bayes correlated
equilibrium. These dual variables have the interpretation as transition probability rates for

a continuous-time Markov process over discrete states. Moreover, we can combine the max-
imization over these dual variables with the maximization over mechanism design variables,

so we have a single maximization problem which is equivalent to but more tractable than
the max-min problem.

This dual approach yields new mechanisms with better revenue guarantee than the ﬁrst

price auction. Here we describe the simplest mechanism given by our framework: suppose
two buyers, a single good to sell, and a uniform [0, 1] distribution of common value for the

good. Consider a binary mechanism: each buyer can say Yes or No, with the following

2

allocations and payments:

1. If one says No, then he pays nothing and does not get the good.

2. If one says Yes and the other says No, the Yes buyer pays 3/16 and gets the good.

3. If both say Yes, then each still pays 3/16 individually and each gets the good with

probability 1/2.

We claim that this mechanism guarantees a minimum revenue (over all information structures
and equilibria) of 3/16, which is higher than 1/6 from a ﬁrst price auction. We leave the

proof of this claim and how we derive this mechanism to Section 3.1. Let us sketch here
some examples of information structure and illustrate the performance of this mechanism.
First, take the information structure in which both buyers know exactly the common value
v, for each v ∈ [0, 1]. Consider the symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium in which a buyer
says Yes with probability ρ(v). For v ∈ [3/16, 3/8] each buyer is indiﬀerent between Yes and
No, so

(1 − ρ(v))v + ρ(v)v/2 = 3/16,

i.e.,

(1)

(2)

(3)

2 − 3/(8v) 3/16 ≤ v ≤ 3/8

.

v ≤ 3/16

v ≥ 3/8

ρ(v) =


In this mixed-strategy equilibrium, the expected revenue is

Z 3/8
3/16 (cid:0)3/16 · 2ρ(v)(1 − ρ(v)) + 3/8 · ρ(v)2(cid:1) dv + (1 − 3/8) · 3/8 ≈ 0.277526,

which is indeed higher than the lower bound of 3/16.

Consider another information structure with two signals (high and low): conditional on
v ≤ 1/4, both buyers get the low signals; conditional on 1/4 ≤ v ≤ 3/4, with probability 1/2
buyer 1 gets the high signal and buyer 2 gets the low signal (and vice versa with probability
1/2); conditional on v ≥ 3/4, both buyers get the high signals. Suppose that each buyer says
Yes if he gets the high signal and says No if he gets the low signal. This is an equilibrium:
conditional on a buyer receiving the low signal, his expected payoﬀ from saying Yes is:

0

which is strictly better than saying No. Finally, it is easy to see that the expected revenue
from this equilibrium is 3/16, exactly hitting the lower bound.

2 Model

Information

Suppose the mechanism designer has a single good to sell, and there are a ﬁnite number of
buyers (let I be the set of buyers, with 1 ≤ |I| < ∞). The buyers have a common value
v ∈ V = {v, v + ν, v + 2ν, . . . , v} for the good and have quasi-linear utility. Let p ∈ ∆(V ) be
the prior distribution of value; the prior p is known by the designer as well as by the buyers.

(The prior p is the only thing known by the designer.) Without loss suppose that p(v) > 0
for every v ∈ V .

Each buyer i may possess some additional information ti ∈ Ti about the common value

beyond the prior, where ˜p ∈ ∆(V ×Qi∈I Ti) such that margV ˜p = p,2 so his information

about the common value is informed by ˜p( · | ti). As discussed in the introduction, the
information structure (Ti, ˜p)i∈I is not known by the designer.

Mechanism

A mechanism is a set of allocation rules qi : M → [0, 1] and payment rules Pi : M → R

satisfying Pi∈I qi(m) ≤ 1, where Mi is the message space of buyer i, and M =Qi∈I Mi the

space of message proﬁle. We assume that a mechanism always has an opt-out option for
each buyer i: there exists a message mi ≡ 0 ∈ Mi such that qi(0, m−i) = Pi(0, m−i) = 0 for
every m−i ∈ M−i.

Equilibrium

Given a mechanism (qi, Pi)i∈I and an information structure (Ti, ˜p)i∈I, we have a game of
incomplete information. A Bayes Nash Equilibrium (BNE) of the game is deﬁned by strategy

2Let margV ˜p be the marginal distribution of ˜p over V .

4

σi : Ti → ∆(Mi) for each buyer i such that for every ti ∈ Ti, the support of σi(ti) are best
responding to others’ strategies:

supp σi(ti) ∈ argmax

mi∈Mi X(v,t−i)∈V ×T−i

(vqi(mi, σ−i(t−i)) − Pi(mi, σ−i(t−i))˜p(v, t−i | ti).

(4)

The ex ante distribution µ ∈ ∆(V ×M) generated by any BNE (σi)i∈I of any information

structure (Ti, ˜p)i∈I satisﬁes the following two conditions:

µ(v, m) = p(v),

v ∈ V,

i ∈ I, (mi, m′

i) ∈ Mi × Mi.

i, m−i)) − Pi(mi, m−i) + Pi(m′

A distribution µ ∈ ∆(V × M) that satisﬁes the above two conditions is called a Bayes
Correlated Equilibrium (BCE) of the mechanism (qi, Pi)i∈I. For any BCE µ, there exists
an information structure and a BNE of that information structure that generates µ. See
Bergemann and Morris (2016) for more details.

Designer’s problem

Since the mechanism designer does not know the buyers’ information structure, a natural
way for him to design his mechanism is to be cautious and maximize the minimum revenue

among all information structure and equilibrium.

The mechanism designer wants to solve:

max

(qi,Pi)i∈I

min

µ∈∆(V ×M ) X(v,m)Xi

µ(v, m)Pi(m)

(7)

such that µ is a BCE of (qi, Pi)i∈I

2.1 Minimum-Revenue BCE

As a prerequisite to solve the designer’s problem, we ﬁrst study the minimum revenue gen-
erated by its BCE for a ﬁxed mechanism (Pi, qi)i∈I. We deﬁne

Ui(v, m) ≡ vqi(m) − Pi(m), m ∈ M, v ∈ V.

(8)

5

The BCE that minimizes revenue can be found by the following primal problem:

Pi(m)µ(v, m)

min

µ X(v,m)Xi

subject to:

(9)

(Ui(v, m) − Ui(v, (m′

i, m−i)))µ(v, m) ≥ 0,

i ∈ I, (mi, m′

i) ∈ Mi × Mi,

X(v,m−i)
Xm

µ(v, m) = p(v),

v ∈ V,

µ(v, m) ≥ 0,

v ∈ V, m ∈ M.

For notational brevity, we omit the set of which a summation variable belongs when it is
obvious; for example, summing over m means summing over m ∈ M.

The dual problem is:

p(v)γ(v)

max

subject to:

(αi,γ)i∈I Xv
γ(v) +Xi Xm′

i

(Ui(v, m) − Ui(v, (m′

i, m−i)))αi(m′

(10)

Pi(m),

v ∈ V, m ∈ M,

αi(m′

i | mi) ≥ 0,

i ∈ I, (mi, m′

i) ∈ Mi × Mi,

where α(m′
m′

i | mi) is the dual variable for the obedience or incentive constraint of not playing
i when advised to play mi in (9), and γ(v) is the dual variable for the consistency constraint

of Pm µ(v, m) = p(v).

The dual problem can be succinctly written as:

max

(αi)i∈I Xv

p(v) · min
m

Rev(v, m),

where

Rev(v, m) ≡Xi


Pi(m) +Xm′

i

(Ui(v, m′

i, m−i) − Ui(v, m))αi(m′

i | mi)
 .

(11)

(12)

We note that Rev(v, m) is independent of the value of αi(mi | mi) for every mi.

Here is an interesting representation of Rev(v, m) by matrices when there are two buyers:

6

suppose buyer 1’s messages M1 are the rows, and buyer 2’s messages M2 are the columns,
Rev(v), Pi and Ui(v) are M1 × M2 matrices,

Rev(v) = P1 + α1 · U1(v) + P2 + U2(v) · α2,

(13)

where α1 is a M1 × M1 transition rate matrix (or Q matrix): the oﬀ-diagonal entries of α1
are non-negative, each row of α1 sums to 0; and α2 is a M2 × M2 transition rate matrix:
the oﬀ-diagonal entries of α2 are non-negative, each column of α2 sums to 0. Transition rate
matrix is the analogue of the transition probability matrix for a continuous-time Markov

process over discrete states (see Stroock (2013), Chapter 5).

The Problem (10) is bounded, by the following lemma:

Lemma 1. For any {αi(m′

i | mi)} such that αi(m′

i | mi) ≥ 0 for m′

i 6= mi, we have

min
m

Rev(v, m) ≤ v,

for every v ∈ V .

Proof. Fix an arbitrary v ∈ V . Consider the problem:

αi(m′

i ∈ I, (mi, m′

i) ∈ Mi × Mi.

The dual to the above problem is:

(14)

(15)

(16)

Pi(m), m ∈ M,

µ(m)(Ui(v, m) − Ui(v, (m′

i, m−i))) ≥ 0,

Pi(m)

subject to:

µ(m) = 1

µ(m) ≥ 0, m ∈ M,

7

which is minimizing the revenue over complete-information correlated equilibria µ (for the

Pi(m)) ≥ 0 for every i ∈ I and mi ∈ Mi because of the presence of the opt-out mes-

ﬁxed v). For any µ satisfying the constraints, we havePm−i µ(m)Ui(v, m) =Pm−i µ(m)(vqi(m)−
sage 0 ∈ Mi. Therefore, Pm µ(m)Pi(viqi(m) − Pi(m)) ≥ 0, and Pm µ(m)Pi Pi(m) ≤
Pm µ(m)Pi vqi(m) ≤ v. Thus the optimal solution of (15) is bounded above by v.

3 Mechanism Design

Given the previous derivations, mechanism designer’s problem in (7) can be written as:

p(v) · min
m

Rev(v, m)

(17)

max

(Pi,qi,αi)i∈I Xv

subject to:

Rev(v, m)

(v(q(m′

i, m−i) − q(m)) − P (m′

i, m−i)) + P (m)αi(m′

i | mi),

v ∈ V, m ∈ M,

=Xi

Pi(m) +Xi Xm′

i

qi(m) ≥ 0,

i ∈ I, Xi

qi(m) ≤ 1, m ∈ M,

qi(0, m−i) = Pi(0, m−i) = 0, m−i ∈ M−i, αi(m′

i | mi) ≥ 0,

(mi, m′

i) ∈ Mi × Mi,

i ∈ I.

where we label the opt-out message as 0 ∈ Mi.

The advantage of problem (17) over the equivalent problem (7) is that we minimize over a
ﬁnite set M instead of an inﬁnite set in ∆(V ×M). Moreover, (17) is a bilinear programming
problem: ﬁxing the mechanism (Pi, qi)i∈I the maximization problem over (αi)i∈I is linear;
and ﬁxing the dual variables (αi)i∈I the maximization problem over (Pi, qi)i∈I is also linear.
When there are two buyers (|I| = 2), it is without loss of generality to restrict to sym-

metric mechanism and symmetric dual variable:

Lemma 2. Suppose there are two buyers I = {1, 2}. To solve Problem (17), it is without
loss of generality to restrict attention to M1 = M2 and symmetric (qi, Pi, αi)i∈I:
that is,
q1(m1, m2) = q2(m2, m1), P1(m1, m2) = P2(m2, m1), and α1(m2 | m1) = α2(m2 | m1) hold
for every m1, m2 ∈ M1 = M2.

Proof. For any tuple (qi, Pi, αi)i∈I over message M1 × M2, we can symmetrize it by setting
˜M1 = ˜M2 = M1∪M2 (without loss of generality suppose M1∩M2 = ∅). For any ˜m1, ˜m2 ∈ ˜M1,

8

and likewise for ˜P1 and ˜P2; also deﬁne for ˜m′

1, ˜m1 ∈ ˜M1:

q1( ˜m1, ˜m2)

˜m1 ∈ M1, ˜m2 ∈ M2

q2( ˜m2, ˜m1)

˜m1 ∈ M2, ˜m2 ∈ M1

,

otherwise

˜m′

1 ∈ M2, ˜m1 ∈ M2

.



1 | ˜m1) = ˜α2( ˜m′

˜α1( ˜m′

0

It is easy to see that minm Rev(v, m) for (qi, Pi, αi)i∈I is the same as min ˜m Rev(v, ˜m) for

(˜qi, ˜Pi, ˜αi)i∈I.

We now restrict to the case of two buyers I = {1, 2} and symmetric mechanism in
the sense of Lemma 2 (with the exception of Section 3.3 when we consider a single buyer).
We abbreviate (q1, P1, α1) to (q, P, α). We also let ν → 0 so the set of values becomes a
continuum.

3.1 Two Messages

Consider ﬁrst a mechanism with two messages: M1 = M2 = {0, 1} (where 0 is the opt-out
message).

We write the objective of Problem (17) as:

Π =Z min(Rev(v, (0, 0)), Rev(v, (1, 0)), Rev(v, (1, 1))) p(dv),

(18)

which we want to maximize subject to feasibility constraints: 0 ≤ q(1, 0) ≤ 1 and 0 ≤
q(1, 1) ≤ 1/2 (recall that q(0, 1) = q(0, 0) = 0 = P (0, 0) = P (0, 1)). By symmetry we have
Rev(v, (0, 1)) = Rev(v, (1, 0)).

Suppose α(0 | 1) = 0 and α(1 | 0) = a > 0. Under these assumptions,

∂ Rev(v, m)

∂q(1, 0)

2av m = (0, 0)

0

m 6= (0, 0)

=


9

(19)

Similarly for the derivative with respect to q(1, 1). Thus we have

∂Π

∂q(1, 0)

> 0 and

∂Π

∂q(1, 1)

> 0,

and to maximize Π we have q(1, 0) = 1 and q(1, 1) = 1/2.

We compute:

Rev(v, (0, 0)) = 2av − 2aP (1, 0),

Rev(v, (1, 0)) = av/2 − aP (1, 1) + P (1, 0),

Rev(v, (1, 1)) = 2P (1, 1).

Thus, we solve

(20)

(21)

Π∗ ≡

av

− aP (1, 1) + P (1, 0), 2P (1, 1)(cid:17) p(dv).

(22)
Suppose p is the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. The optimal solution to the above problem

is P (1, 0) = P (1, 1) = 3/16 and a = 1, and they give the maximum Π∗ = 3/16.

Proposition 1. Suppose there are two buyers and the prior p is the uniform distribution on
[0, 1]. The symmetric mechanism of M1 = M2 = {0, 1} and

q(0, 0) = q(0, 1) = 0, q(1, 0) = 1, q(1, 1) = 1/2,

(23)

P (0, 0) = P (0, 1) = 0, P (1, 0) = P (1, 1) = 3/16,

guarantees a minimum revenue (among all BCE) of 3/16.

For comparison we note that for the same setting (two buyers, uniform distribution of

common value) the ﬁrst price auction guarantee a minimum revenue (among all BCE) of
only 1/6; see Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (2015). And Lemma 1 implies that the revenue
that any mechanism can guarantee among BCE is bounded above by E[v] = 1/2 (since any

BCE revenue in any mechanism is less or equal to 1/2), although this bound is unlikely to
be tight.

For the mechanism in Proposition 1, the dual variables of α(1 | 0) = 1 and α(0 | 1) = 0
satisﬁes the complementary slackness conditions for Problems (9) and (10) with respect to

10

primal variables µ(v, m) such that

µ( · | v) =

2 · 1(1,0)

1/4 ≤ v < 3/4

,

v ≥ 3/4

(24)

margV µ = uniform distribution on [0, 1].

Recall that µ(v, m) is the BCE described in the introduction. From the complementary

slackness conditions we conclude that α solves Problem (10) and µ solves Problem (9), so µ
is the BCE that minimizes revenue for this mechanism.

3.2 General Messages

We can do much better with more messages. In general we want to maximize:

Π =Z min

m∈M

(Rev(v, m)) p(dv),

(25)

subject to the feasibility constraints. Thus, it makes sense to make Rev(v, m) over m as
redundant as possible, to minimize the number of things in min(·) inside the integral.

Consider a mechanism with k + 1 messages: M1 = M2 = {0, 1, . . . , k}. Our usual

assumption on the mechanism is:

q(0, j) = 0 = P (0, j),

q(j, l) ≥ 0,

q(j, l) + q(l, j) ≤ 1,

(j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k}2.

(26)

We make the following assumptions:

Rev(v, (0, 0)) = Rev(v, (j, l)),

v ∈ V, (j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}2

(27)

Rev(v, (0, k)) = Rev(v, (j, k)),

v ∈ V, j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}

α(j ′ | j) =


where a is a positive constant.3

a j ′ = j + 1

0

j ′ 6= j + 1

,

(j, j ′) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k}2,

(28)

3By symmetry, the second line of (27) implies that Rev(v, (0, k)) = Rev(v, (k, 0)) = Rev(v, (k, j)) =

Rev(v, (j, k)), j = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1.

11

Condition (27) attempts to make Rev(v, m) as redundant as possible. Condition (28) is

for tractability and is inspired by binding local incentive constraints.

Under (28), Equation (27) holds if and only if

2q(1, 0) = q(j + 1, l) − q(j, l) + q(l + 1, j) − q(l, j),

(j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}2,

q(1, k) = q(j + 1, k) − q(j, k),

j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1},

(29)

and

−2aP (1, 0) = P (j, l) + P (l, j) − a(P (j + 1, l) − P (j, l)) − a(P (l + 1, j) − P (l, j)),

(j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}2,

P (k, 0) − aP (1, k) = P (j, k) + P (k, j) − a(P (j + 1, k) − P (j, k)),

j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}.

Since

otherwise

in the optimum the feasibility constraint q(j, k) + q(k, j) ≤ 1 must bind:

q(j, k) + q(k, j) = 1,

j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k}.

(32)

Lemma 3. For every k ≥ 1, there exists {q(j, l) : 1 ≤ j ≤ k, 0 ≤ l ≤ k} that satisﬁes (26),
(29) and (32). For any such q we have q(1, 0) = (3k + 1)/(4k2) and q(1, k) = 1/(2k).

Lemma 4. For any values of a > 0, k ≥ 1, P (1, 0), P (1, k) and P (k, 0), there exists
{P (j, l) : 1 ≤ j ≤ k, 0 ≤ l ≤ k, (j, l) 6∈ {(1, 0), (1, k), (k, 0)}} that satisﬁes (30). For any
such P we have

P (k, k) =(cid:0)(1 + 1/a)k − 1(cid:1)2

aP (1, 0) + ((1 + 1/a)k − 1)(aP (1, k) − P (k, 0)).

X ≡ aP (1, 0),

Y ≡ aP (1, k) − P (k, 0)

(35)

We thus solve:

Proposition 2. Suppose there are two buyers. There exists a symmetric mechanism that
guarantees a minimum revenue (among all BCE) of Π∗ deﬁned in (36).

The following allocation rule works for the mechanism in Proposition 2 (given k from

(36)):

q(0, l) = 0,

l ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k},

(37)

q(j + 1, k) − q(j, k) = 1/(2k),

j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1},

(3k + 1)/(4k2)

(2k + 1)/(4k2)

j > l

(j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}2.

The payment rule for the mechanism in Proposition 2 is more ﬂexible and just needs to

satisfy (given k, a, X, Y from (36)):

− 2X = P (j, l) + P (l, j) − a(P (j + 1, l) − P (j, l)) − a(P (l + 1, j) − P (l, j)), (j, l) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}2,

− Y = P (j, k) + P (k, j) − a(P (j + 1, k) − P (j, k)),

j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}.

Uniform Distribution

Suppose the prior p is the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Let us take k → ∞ and choose a

(42)

Substituting (42) into (41) gives:

Π =

λ2(4 + λ(4 + 3λ))
4(1 + λ)4 log(1 + λ)

,

(43)

which is maximized at λ ≈ 2.89, giving Π∗ ≈ 0.27.

Corollary 1. Suppose there are two buyers and the prior p is the uniform distribution on
[0, 1]. There exists a symmetric mechanism that guarantees a minimum revenue (among all
BCE) of Π∗ ≈ 0.27.

3.3 A Single Buyer

In this subsection we consider the case of one buyer I = {1} for comparison. In this case the
buyer does not necessarily know his own value, and each BCE corresponds to an information
structure about value and the associated equilibrium play. For a uniform [0, 1] distribution

of value, we know that the designer can guarantee (among all BCE) a revenue of at most 1/4:
ﬁx any mechanism, there is a BCE corresponding to the buyer knowing his value (i.e., the
classical private-value information structure), and its revenue must be less than 1/4 which

14

is obtained by the private-value optimal mechanism (a posted price of 1/2). We want to see
how close to 1/4 our methodology can guarantee in the setting of one buyer.

As before we abbreviate (q1, P1, α1) to (q, P, α). Consider k+1 messages: M1 = {0, 1, . . . , k}.

Our usual assumption on the mechanism is

q(0) = P (0) = 0,

0 ≤ q(j) ≤ 1, j = 0, 1, . . . , k.

(44)

Using our previous methodology (making Rev(v, m) as redundant as possible), we con-

sider (q, P, α) such that:

Rev(v, 0) = Rev(v, 1) = · · · = Rev(v, k − 1),

v ∈ V,

α(j ′ | j) =


for a constant a > 0.

a j ′ = j + 1

0

j ′ 6= j + 1

,

(j, j ′) ∈ {0, 1, . . . k}2,

(45)

(46)

Under Condition (46), Equation (45) holds if and only if for every j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k − 1},

q(j + 1) − q(j) = q(j) − q(j − 1),

P (j + 1) − P (j) =(cid:18)1 +

1

a(cid:19) (P (j) − P (j − 1)).

As before, the optimum must have q(k) = 1; thus we are led to the following mechanism

(with three degrees of freedom: k ≥ 1, P (1) and a ≥ 0):

q(j) = j/k,

P (j) = P (1)a (cid:18)1 +

1

a(cid:19)j

− 1! ,

0 ≤ j ≤ k.

(47)

Proposition 3. Suppose there is a single buyer. There exists a mechanism that guarantees a
minimum revenue (among all BCE) of Π∗ deﬁned in (48). When the prior p is the uniform
distribution on [0, 1], Π∗ ≈ 0.20.

Recall that for any mechanism the minimum BCE revenue is bounded above by 1/4 when

p is the uniform [0, 1] distribution.

Appendix

A Proofs

Proof of Lemma 3. We ﬁrst prove the second part of the lemma. By (32) we have q(k, k) =
1/2. By the second line of (29) this implies that q(j, k) = j/(2k) and q(k, j) = 1 − j/(2k),
j = 0, 1, . . . , k. Then we have

Xj=0

k−1

Xl=0

q(l + 1, j) − q(l, j) = k2q(1, 0)

(54)

where the last equality follows from the ﬁrst line of (30). Thus, q(1, 0) = (3k + 1)/(4k2).

For the ﬁrst part, it is easy to check that q in Equation (37) satisﬁes Conditions (29),

(26) and (32).

Proof of Lemma 4. We ﬁrst prove the existence part of the lemma. There exists

{P (j, l) : 1 ≤ l ≤ k − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ l + 1}

that satisﬁes the ﬁrst line of (30), for any given values of

{P (j, l) : 1 ≤ j ≤ k, 0 ≤ l ≤ k − 1} \ {P (j, l) : 1 ≤ l ≤ k − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ l + 1}.

For the second line of (30), we can rewrite it as Rev(j − 1, k) = Rev(j, k), i.e.,

P (j + 1, k) − P (j, k) = (1 + 1/a)(P (j, k) − P (j − 1, k)) + (P (k, j) − P (k, j − 1))/a,

(55)

for j = 1, 2, . . . , k − 1. Clearly, the above equation can be satisﬁed for any given values of
P (1, k) and P (k, j), j = 1, 2, . . . , k − 1. This proves the ﬁrst part of the lemma.

Now for the second part: ﬁx {P (j, l)} that satisﬁes (26) and (30).
Equation (55) implies that

P (j + 1, k) − P (j, k) = (1 + 1/a)jP (1, k) +

(P (k, j ′) − P (k, j ′ − 1))/a, (56)

and as a consequence,

P (k, k) = a((1 + 1/a)k − 1)P (1, k) +

We claim that

((1 + 1/a)k−j − 1)(P (k, j) − P (k, j − 1)).

X(l) ≡

(1 + 1/a)l−j(P (l, j) − P (l, j − 1))

Xj=1

= P (l, l − 1) + a((1 + 1/a)l − 1)2P (1, 0) − (1 + 1/a)lP (l, 0),

(58)

for every l = 1, 2, . . . , k. Equation (58) for l = k and Equation (57) together imply Equation

(33), which proves the second part of the lemma.

Clearly, (58) is true for l = 1. Suppose (58) is true for l = κ < k as an induction

hypothesis; we prove that this implies (58) is true for l = κ + 1.

From Rev(v, (κ, j − 1)) = Rev(v, (κ, j)) we have:

P (κ + 1, j) − P (κ + 1, j − 1)

= (1 + 1/a)(P (κ, j) − P (κ, j − 1)) + (1 + 1/a)(P (j, κ) − P (j − 1, κ))

− (P (j + 1, κ) − P (j, κ)),

summing the above equation across j = 1, 2, . . . , κ − 1 gives:

− (1 + 1/a)2(P (κ, κ) − P (κ − 1, κ)) + (1 + 1/a)(P (κ + 1, κ) − P (κ + 1, κ − 1)),

where in the last equality we have used the induction hypothesis (58) for l = κ.

From Rev(v, (κ, 0)) = Rev(v, (1, 0)) we have (1 + 1/a)P (κ, 0) − P (1, κ) = P (κ + 1, 0) −

2P (1, 0). Therefore, the previous equation is equivalent to:

X(κ + 1)

(62)

= (1 + 1/a)2P (κ, κ − 1) + a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2P (1, 0) − (1 + 1/a)κ+1(P (κ + 1, 0) − 2P (1, 0))

− (1 + 1/a)2(P (κ, κ) − P (κ − 1, κ)) + (1 + 1/a)(P (κ + 1, κ) − P (κ + 1, κ − 1))

= (1 + 1/a)2P (κ, κ − 1) + [a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2 + 2(1 + 1/a)κ+1]P (1, 0) − (1 + 1/a)κ+1P (κ + 1, 0)

− (1 + 1/a)2(P (κ, κ) − P (κ − 1, κ)) + (1 + 1/a)(P (κ + 1, κ) − P (κ + 1, κ − 1))

From Rev(v, (κ, κ)) = Rev(v, (1, 0)) we have (1 + 1/a)P (κ, κ) − P (κ + 1, κ) = −P (1, 0).

Therefore, the previous equation is equivalent to:

X(κ + 1)

(63)

= (1 + 1/a)2P (κ, κ − 1) + [a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2 + 2(1 + 1/a)κ+1 + (1 + 1/a)]P (1, 0)

− (1 + 1/a)κ+1P (κ + 1, 0) + (1 + 1/a)2P (κ − 1, κ) − (1 + 1/a)P (κ + 1, κ − 1).

From Rev(v, (κ − 1, κ)) = Rev(v, (1, 0)) we have (1 + 1/a)P (κ, κ − 1) + (1 + 1/a)P (κ − 1, κ) −
P (κ + 1, κ − 1) = P (κ, κ) − 2P (1, 0), Therefore, the previous equation is equivalent to:

X(κ + 1)

(64)

= [a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2 + 2(1 + 1/a)κ+1 − (1 + 1/a)]P (1, 0)

− (1 + 1/a)κ+1P (κ + 1, 0) + (1 + 1/a)P (κ, κ).

19

Finally, using (1 + 1/a)P (κ, κ) − P (κ + 1, κ) = −P (1, 0) again we get:

X(κ + 1)

(65)

= [a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2 + 2(1 + 1/a)κ+1 − (1 + 1/a) − 1]P (1, 0)

− (1 + 1/a)κ+1P (κ + 1, 0) + P (κ + 1, κ).

Since a(1 + 1/a)2((1 + 1/a)κ − 1)2 + 2(1 + 1/a)κ+1 − (1 + 1/a) − 1 = a((1 + 1/a)κ+1 − 1)2,

this proves (58) when l = κ + 1.
