Abstract

The concepts of a population and a species play fundamental roles
in biology. The existence and precise deﬁnition of higher-order hierar-
chies, such as division into species, is open to debate among biologists.
Here we show a new metric, ‘small s’, that distinguishes the population
number and various data values that are beyond the range of neutral
logarithmic populations and are speciﬁc to a given species with quanti-
zation, by the data from natural environments. We modify Price equa-
tion to introduce the metric. We show prime number could be related
with speciation in discontinuity in Riemann zeta function including
Bose-Einstein condensation, while prime closed geodesics could repre-
sent populations in Selberg zeta function. Calculation of prime closed
geodesics |N (p)| leads out non-interacting adaptive species world is
in the mode |N (p)| = 2/3, while interacting neutral populations is in
the mode |N (p)| = 1. Combining the calculation with phylogenetical
asymmetry, this discrimination gives the investigator whether the ob-
served hierarchy of data represents chaotic populations/non-adaptive
species or adaptive species with newly deﬁned critical temperature
and Weiss ﬁeld. The border of ﬂuctuating populations and ordered
species is ℜ(s) = 2, which is proven both theoretically and by obser-
vation. mod 4 of ℑ(s) reveals adaptive/disadaptive situations among

1

the individuals. Furthermore, our model has partially been successful
for predicting futures at a unit time after, as transitions of biologilcal
phases. Signiﬁcance of biological hierarchy is also discussed. In our
new model (PzDom model), calculation requires only sets of the num-
bers of individual densities in time course.

Introduction

Living organisms encompass several levels of scaling/hierarchy. Inside cells,
protein molecules are on the order of nanometers, and they cooperate or
compete by activation or inhibition of speciﬁc biological activities. Normal
eukaryotic cells are on the order of 10 µm, and their activities are the conse-
quence of interactions between the molecules inside of them. In multicellular
systems, each cell has a role on its own activity, and these combine to deter-
mine the interactions between the cells in the system. In nature, the number
of individuals increases and decreases following the particular dynamics of
that population, as characterized by their intrinsic physiologies and the inter-
actions between the individuals. Molecular biology and ecology have already
elucidated certain roles for the hierarchies that are inherent in living organ-
isms. Therefore obviously it is important to know the common deﬁnition of
species among diﬀerent biological taxa, if we would like to compare dynamics
of communities among the taxa. In particular, population, which is ranked
just below the species in the hierarchy, is often deﬁned both ecologically and
demographically. Krebs (1972)[47] deﬁnes a population as “a group of organ-
isms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time.”
This is obviously a qualitative deﬁnition, and researchers utilize deﬁnitions
of population that are appropriate in the context of their own studies. In
contrast, a species has a long history for clariﬁcation of the deﬁnition. John
Ray had already produced a biological deﬁnition of species, in his Historia
Plantarum (1686): ... no surer criterion for determining species has occurred
to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propa-
gation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals
or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they

2

are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species... Animals
likewise that diﬀer speciﬁcally preserve their distinct species permanently;
one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa (trans-
lated by Silk E)[73]. Although he considered species as a static image by
creationism, it is important to regard his foresight to distinguish variation
within species and diﬀerence between species. The idea is further expanded
to a novel diﬀerence in discontinuity among spectra of Selberg zeta function
and zero points of Riemann zeta function later in this manuscript. Carl von
Linn´e described in his Systema Naturæ (1735)[92] systematic deﬁnitions of
biological taxa in diﬀerent hierarchies, such as species, genus, order and class,
later followed by family, phylum, kingdom and domain. He also established
binomial nomenclature of scientiﬁc name. Despite still in static image of
species by creationism, these idea enabled qualitative estimation of related-
ness among diﬀerent living organisms systematically. The static image of
creationism itself was doubted after the work of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck,
Philosophie Zoologique (1809)[14], in which Lamarckian inheritance was pro-
posed. Despite ignored until recent, it is re-evaluated by recent works of
transgenerational epigenetic inheritance[30]. The idea of ‘evolution’ was fur-
ther developed in Alfred Russel Wallace’s “On the tendency of varieties to
depart indeﬁnitely from the original type” (1858)[94] and Charles Darwin’s
On the Origin of Species (1859)[12] as natural and sexual selection. However,
they still did not know what is the actual cause of speciation. Gregor Mendel
proposed in his “Versuche ¨uber Pﬂanzenhybriden” (1866) that genetic infor-
mation might be important for plant hybridization and evolution[56], how-
ever, in the modern light the experiments he performed was achieved under
hybridization of a plant species with diﬀerent alleles, not actual hybrids of
species. The modern deﬁnition of species is come as an evolutionary and
reproductive concept, and was described by Ernst Mayr’s Systematics and
the Origin of Species (1942)[54] as follows: “species are groups of actually
or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively
isolated from other such groups”. Up until now, the essence of the diﬀer-
ence between the concepts of population and species has been whether the
concepts themselves are ecological/physical or evolutionary/genetic in na-
ture. However, complex situations may arise in which a combined deﬁnition
is required, and it may be diﬃcult to determine whether the obtained data
originated from populations or species, due to the ambiguities of the over-
lapping deﬁnitions [10] [97]. For example, ‘ring species’ represent continuous
phenotypic characteristics and reproductive viability between the physical

3

neighbors, in contrast to the reproductive inviability between the physical
edges of the species. This means reproductive isolation alone cannot well de-
ﬁne the proper diﬀerences in species, and it is a problem. In contrast, reports
of sympatric speciation demonstrate metaphysical existence of species and
speciation with discontinuity even in environmentally non-isolated situations
(e.g. Barluenga et al. (2006)[5]). There is a claim that biological species
concept is a mere concept that describes uniﬁcation of individuals and their
genotypes within the population and populations within the species, by gene
exchange resulting from bisexual reproduction and migration. Then the de-
gree of this uniﬁcation should be correlated with the presence of bisexual
reproduction, though in reality this correlation is very low, and uniparental
species often diﬀer very little from their biparental relatives living in similar
conditions. Thus isolated populations of biparental species often retain their
speciﬁc identity for a long time in spite of the absence of gene exchange and
eﬃciency of migration [72]. We partially solved the situation by decoupling
short-term ecological time scale and long-term evolutionary time scale by
the order of 1017, at least in Japanese Dictyostelia [1]. That is, populations
can be “neutral” within themselves, but the assemblage of populations as a
whole is not always neutral. Therefore the time scale of species/gene ﬂow
is supposed to be entirely diﬀerent from that of population/migration. In
this manuscript, we would like to further clarify ‘a metric’ useful for dis-
criminating the dynamics of population/species and will use the following
deﬁnitions in our analysis, which is based on actual data obtained from a
natural environment. We deﬁne a population as a group of individuals of a
sexually reproducing species inhabiting the same area and time, and a species
as a sum of populations with genetically close relationships distinguishable
by discontinuity of genetic distances among diﬀerent species speciﬁc to each
niche. In this way, deﬁnition of species cannot be disentangled from actual
interactions of the constitutes of community. The history of social inter-
actions in biology started from William Donald Hamilton’s “The genetical
evolution of social behavior” (1964)[27], John Maynard Smith’s “Group selec-
tion and kin selection” (1964)[82] and George Robert Price’s “Selection and
covariance” (1970)[70]. They established genetic relatedness is important
for maintaining cooperative phenotypes and evolution of living organisms.
For co-evolvable non-relatives, it is important to consider reciprocal altruism
to maintain the cooperations, as proposed in Robert Trivers’s “The evolu-
tion of reciprocal altruism” (1971)[90]. Finally, multilevel selection theories,
such as “Reintroducing group selection to the human behavioral sciences”

4

(1994)[99] and Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselﬁsh Be-
havior (1998)[83], are proposed by Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson.
The theories can explain actual cooperative selection process of individual
genes distantly related within a cell/an individual as a reproduction unit.
Biological hierarchies are thus regarded as an important idea to analyze evo-
lutionally process. In the other light, despite the lack of agreement among
biologist, information theory (not thermodynamics as usual) can be used to
analyze the dynamics of the concomitantly observed scales. However, the ex-
tent of ‘genetically close relationships’ among species cannot be distinguished
easily from that of populations. Therefore we would like to deﬁne a species
in a newly introduced metric, especially in adaptive situation, and concluded
that a geodesic |N(p)| = 2/3 is a successful candidate for discriminating
adaptive species from chaotic population/species with |N(p)| = 1.
To this aim we need a model system for inspection. The theory of dif-
fusion equations in population genetics by Kimura (1964)[38] is one of the
candidate models. In the model, genetic characteristics are used for demon-
strating dynamics. Despite the original genetic model, here we intend to use
the ratio of the number of individuals to the whole population, instead of
gene frequencies, to investigate the dynamics. This means the uniﬁcation
of genetic information and environmental eﬀects to the number of individ-
uals. In the light of the above mentions, spatially distributed models that
assume knowledge of underlying stochastic processes, usually drawn from
birth/death, immigration/emigration, mutation/speciation and niche diﬀer-
entiation, were developed for further understanding the nature of observed
populations/species (e.g. Leibold et al. (2004)[49]). In the uniﬁed neutral
theory [32][33][9], a local community (an ecological unit composed of a group
of organisms or a population of diﬀerent species occupying a particular area,
usually interacting with each other and their environment) exhibits domina-
tion of population by a few species and extinction of rarer species, compared
with neutral logarithmic distribution. On the metacommunity (a set of local
communities that are linked by dispersal) scale, biological diversity is larger,
and a nearly logarithmic distribution of population abundance in ranked
species is observed. Like the diﬀusion equation model in population genet-
ics, the distributions depend not on individual adaptations but on random
ecological drifts via a Markov process [32][33], or in other words, maximizing
information entropy/Shannon index [79][29][4]. Idiosyncrasies [71] seems to
be involved in Hubbell’s theory (see also Adachi (2015)[1]). There is also a
proceeding report dealing with MaxEnt of geographic distribution [66]. Thus

5

the uniﬁed neutral theory is a part of information theory. The theory involves
three characterizing parameters: population size, point mutation rate, and
immigration rate. Please note that we only utilize C ¯wN part of Kimura’s
theory without any need of Hardy-Weinberg principle, independent of gene
frequencies of diﬀerent alleles. Therefore the assumption of genetic equilib-
rium has nothing to do with our model. Please also note that we only utilize
Hubbell’s theory as a basis of calculating the extents of diﬀerence from eco-
logically neutral situations: the equilibrium here again has nothing to do
with our assumptions. By modifying these theories, we were able to distin-
guish neutral populations with shorter time scale from adaptive species with
longer time scale in a set of observed data for Dictyostelia with signiﬁcantly
small value of immigration rate (mi < 10−3)[1].

In this manuscript, we further distinguish populations and species by
newly introduced parameter, ‘small s’ value that is high in a species and
low in a population. First of all, we modify Price equation proposed in “Se-
lection and covariance” (1970)[70] to introduce ‘small s’, which is based on
R = T theorem and Weil’s explicit formula in mathematics [95][86][98]. The
Price equation, originally describes evolution and natural selection both in
mathematics and in genetics, is here utilized in ecological way as replac-
ing gene frequencies to proportion of the number of individuals in popula-
tions/species. The ‘small s’ is well related with covariance and expectation
in the Price equation. Next, introducing Riemann ζ function leads to de-
scription of population burst/collapse as its non-trivial zero points, includ-
ing typical Bose-Einstein condensation and non-typical types. The speci-
ation is well related to prime numbers in this model. The border of ﬂuc-
tuating populations and ordered species is ℜ(s) = 2, which is proven both
theoretically and by observation. Then, we calculate unique equations of
the model as Maass form and examine spectra of the data. Calculation of
prime closed geodesics |N(p)| utilizing Selberg zeta and Hasse-Weil L leads
out non-interacting adaptive species world is in the mode |N(p)| = 2/3,
while interacting neutral populations is in the mode |N(p)| = 1. Combin-
ing the calculation with phylogenetical asymmetry, this discrimination gives
the investigator whether the observed hierarchy of data represents chaotic
populations/non-adaptive species or adaptive species in genuinely successful
niche with a same regard in a particular environment. Our model has also
partially been successful for predicting transitions of biological phases (adap-
tation/disadaptation) at a unit time after. Furthermore, we will propose an
original aspects of the model by diﬀerent deﬁnitions of entropy from that of

6

Harte et al. (2008)[29] and a new deﬁnition of temperature. New metrics,
which are based on statistical mechanics [24][4][85], are deﬁned in order to
distinguish and to invest signiﬁcance of species from population counts of
mixed communities, which is also the topic in actual Eastern Japanese Dic-
tyostelia community [1]. Basically the interpretations of biological systems
by statistical mechanics had started from Lotka (1922)[51] to disastrous com-
plexity of Hamiltonian described in Kerner (1957)[37]. Kerner (1957)[37] also
showed an interesting model for time-developing system, however, it is not
a topic for our model here with a static image mainly. His model and our
model belong to diﬀerent mathematical spaces, and a set of mathematically
rigorous studies is required for describing their interrelationships precisely.
This is diﬀerent from time-dependent ecosystem assembly model that is re-
stricted to ﬁnite Markov chains proposed by Capit´an et al. (2009)[8]. Im-
portantly, here we were able to calculate the diﬀerent sets of critical temper-
atures and Weiss ﬁelds (with Bose-Einstein condensation) at which various
natural ﬁrst-order phase transitions take place among species or populations
(in deﬁnition, ‘phase transitions’ here are a community moves from chaos to
increase/domination by a particular species, and from increase/domination
by a species to domination by a particular population within a species). The
order parameter in this model is large S. This phase transition nature is not
achieved in Harte et al. (2008)[29] and brieﬂy mentioned in Banavar et al.
(2010)[4] as a part of relative entropy. The model can also deduce that the
populations of some highly adapted species are much more stable than those
of others. Additionally, web-based formalism [26] based on combination of
supersymmetry and analogy to ‘transactional interpretation’ of quantum me-
chanics leads to three-dimensional nature × three-dimensional ﬂuctuations
= nine-dimensional nature of the model. Finally, introduction of hybrid in-
viability attributes the scale of the number of population to the hierarchies
observed. Recently Rodr´ıguez and colleagues reported physical frameworks
of quantum principles applied to ecology (e.g. Rodr´ıguez et al.
(2013a;
2015)[75][77]), however, they are based on actual physical thermodynamics
and diﬀerent from more mathematical/informational, non-thermodynamical
approach described here. The proposed model brings new understanding to
the biological ideas of population and species based on information theory
(not ‘physical’ thermodynamics as usual in bunch of papers, but genuinely
informational). We named the model Patch with Zeta Dominance (PzDom)
model, and only by evaluating ℜ(s) values will lead to distinction of chaotic
population and species domination by the border ℜ(s) = 2. Signiﬁcance of

7

biological hierarchies is also discussed. The model requires only sets of the
numbers of individual densities in time course. We propose ground map for
future researches to understand the nature of hierarchical system.

2 Field Research & Experimental Section

The origins of the data for the number of individuals among populations/species
are all based on natural environments, not on laboratorial. The methods for
the observed data set were described in Adachi (2015)[1]. In brief, soil sam-
ples from two point quadrats of the Washidu region of Izu in Japan were
obtained. Then the numbers of individual cellular slime molds per gram of
soil were determined by counting the number of plaques cultivated from soil
samples. Species were identiﬁed by both morphology and by the DNA se-
quences of the 18S rRNA genes. Samples were obtained in each month from
May 2012 to January 2013. Calculations were performed using Microsoft
Excel 12.3.6 and wxMaxima 15.04.0 softwares.

For sampling in detail,

it was performed at two 100 m2 quadrats in

Washidu (35◦3′33′′N, 138◦53′46′′E; 35◦3′45′′N, 138◦53′32′′E). Within each 100 m2
quadrat, nine sample points were established at 5 m intervals. From each
sampling point, 25 g of soil was collected. Cellular slime molds were isolated
from these samples as follows. First, one sample from each site point was
added to 25 ml of sterile water, resuspended, and was ﬁltrated with sterile
gauze. Next, 100 µl of each sample solution was mixed with 100 µl of HL5 cul-
ture medium containing Klebsiella aerogenes and spread on KK2 agar. After
two days of storage in an incubator at 22 ◦C, the number of plaques on each
agar plate was recorded. Note that the number of plaques corresponds to the
total number of living cells with all the possible stages of the life cycle. That
is, the ‘niche’ regarded here is a niche of propagable number of individuals in
Dictyostelia, not in higher hierarchy or lower hierarchy of niche, such as dif-
ferent stages in life cycle of Dictyostelia. Mature fruiting bodies, consisting of
the cells from a single species, were collected along with information regard-
ing the numbers of plaques in the regions in which fruiting bodies of interest
were found. Finally, spores were used to inoculate either KK2 for puriﬁcation
or SM/5 for expansion for further examination. All analyses were performed
within two weeks from the time of collection. The isolated species were
identiﬁed based on 18S rRNA (SSU) sequences, which were ampliﬁed and se-

8

quenced using PCR/sequencing primers described in Medlin et al. (1988)[55],
and the SILVA database (http://www.arb-silva.de/). The recipes of the me-
dia were described at http://dictybase.org/techniques/media/media.html.

3 Results

3.1 Price equation and logarithms introduces a uni-

versal equation for evolution

The neutral logarithmic distribution of ranked biological populations, for
example, a Dictyostelia community[1], can be expressed as follows:

Nk = a − b ln k,

(1)

where N is the population density size or averaged population density of
species over patches, k is its index (rank), and a = N1 and a decreasing
scale b are derived from the data by sorting the populations by number rank.
We also applied this approximation to adaptive species in order to evaluate
the extents of their diﬀerences from neutral populations [1]. Be aware that
this approximation is only applicable to the communities in the same niche
regarded; therefore not applicable to co-evolving community among non-
overlapping niches.

Based on the theory of diﬀusion equations with Markov processes in pop-
ulation genetics[38], here we assume that the relative abundance of the popu-
lations/species is related to the Nth power of D (= ¯w in Kimura (1964)[38])
multiplied by the relative patch quality P (= C in Kimura (1964)[38])
(P DNk = C ¯wNk = Nk/ΣN = φ, see also Kimura (1964)[38]).
‘Patch’ is
deﬁned as a small plot or piece of land, especially one that produces or is
used for growing speciﬁc organisms. In this context, D (with a power law)
represents relative individual ﬁtness, which is a function of time and depends
on a particular genetic/environmental background and the interactions be-
tween individuals. P is a relative environmental variable and is dependent
on the backgrounds of the occupying species; it may diﬀer for the same en-
vironment if the dominant species is diﬀerent.

To understand the principles deduced from this restriction precisely, ﬁrst,

we will introduce Price equation[70]:

wk∆z = cov(wk, zk) + E(wk∆zk).

(2)

9

Please note that z = ln(k · Nk)/ ln k = 1 + ln Nk/ ln k (k 6= 1, z = +∞ when
k = 1), instead of gene frequency in the original Price’s paper. Relative
length between the logarithms of norms N and the rank k (ln k is a relative
entropy from a uniform distribution as a; both logarithms are topological en-
tropies) is discussed later as a basis of Selberg zeta analysis[34]. Next, assume
individual populations/species expects their averaged (expected) maximum
ﬁtness in a particular patch, which is a power of D with E(ΣN)th, when
E(ΣN) is an average of N among populations or a sum of N averaged over
all patches among all species (|Dk|E(ΣN )): a virtual assumption for a world-
line. This is because a population seems to be in equilibrium as logarithmic
distribution[32][33][1] and species acts with more dominancy [1]. This will be
proven by that a scale invariant parameter ‘small s’ exhibits adaptation in
species with neutrality in populations as shown later. Under these assump-
tions, E[w] should be |Dk|E(ΣN ) and E[z] should approximately be ln N1/ ln k.
If we set w = |Dk|E(ΣN ) − ∆z (when k 6= 1, ∆z ≈ ∆Nk ln Dk/ ln k with
Dk ∼ 1. When k = 1, ∆z = ∞ but ∆z is removed from calculation by an
identical ∆z anyway) and divide the Price equation by ∆z, we will have:

wk =

ln N1
Nk
ln k − 1 + |Dk|E(ΣN )(k 6= 1).

(3)

k = 1 case will be deﬁned in the later subsections. For further analyses, we
ln k as ℜ(s) and E(wk) : |Dk|E(ΣN ) as ℑ(s).
will recognize 1 + cov/∆z :
w = s − 1 and w and s thus correspond to R-charges of newly introduced
fermionic ψ and bosonic φ functions, respectively, as characterized through
this manuscript.

Introducing ℜ(s) distinguishes type of neutralities

According to Zipf’s law, introducing the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) will
normalize the kth abundance by E(ΣN):

|Pk||D|Nk = fs(k) =

1

kℜ(s)|ζ(s)|

(4)

We set |ζ| and |Pk| for approximating both s > 1 (ζ > 0, Nk < N1/k) and
s < 1 (ζ < 0, Nk > N1/k) cases. Note that this model is a view from the
ﬁrst ranked populations/species N1, and either cooperation or competition

10

is described based on the dynamics/dominancy of N1. To examine popula-
tion/species dynamics with diﬀerential, linearization of the model leads to

∆Nk

E(ΣN)

= −

∆ζ

kℜ(s)|ζ|2 .

(5)

Therefore, ∆Nk > 0 implies ∆ζ < 0, ∆Nk < 0 implies ∆ζ > 0, and ∆Nk = 0
implies ∆ζ = 0. Each of the local extrema of ζ thus represents a pole for
the population/species, and a large (resp. small) value of |ζ| represents a
small (resp. large) ﬂuctuation. Only those points of ζ that are close to zero
represent growth bursts or collapses of the population/species. According to
Riemann hypothesis, note that at these points, the following will approxi-
mately hold: [ℜ(s) = 1/2] and [ℜ(s) = −2l,ℑ(s) = 0], where l is a natural
number independent of the population/species rank.
Taking the logarithm of this equation, we obtain

Therefore,

ℜ(s) is obviously a scale invariant if k is a ﬁxed number in a particular sys-
tem of interests. Note that s and ζ(s) can thus be approximated using data
from the distribution of N. When k = 1 in species, s can be calculated by

11

an inverse function of ζ. For convergence, it is necessary that N ∼ 0, s ∼ 1,
ζ ∼ ±∞, and P ∼ 0. We will also assume that s = +∞ and ζ = 1 when a
single population/species was observed. We analyzed the s values using both
the relative abundances of the population and the species in Adachi (2015)[1]
and determined that they give signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results (Fig. 1, Table 1).
The population values are restricted to those between 0 and 2, while those
of species are often greater than 2. This proves that populations behave
neutrally, while species is more prone to domination as will be discussed in
more detail later. The s values larger than 2 therefore represent dynamics
speciﬁc to species, as will be discussed below. In the table, some quantized
values (6/54) for s greater than 2 in species are indicated in red; these have
never been observed in a population out of 162 samples. In the following,
the parameter s is deﬁned as the ‘small s’ of this model. Note that the way
of calculating ℜ(s) is not diﬀerent whether the data are from population or
species when k 6= 1, and this clariﬁes the deﬁnition of population/species;
when k 6= 1, the deﬁnition as population/species only aﬀects the calculation
of ℑ(s) as later described.

If Dk ∼ 1, there are two possible situations: (i) Pk ≈ 1/ζ(s) ≈ Σµ(n)/ns
(µ is the M¨obius function) must be true in order for a to converge, and for b
to converge, we need s ∼ 0; (ii) For N to converge, we need s ∼ 1 in the case
Pk << 1. In this case, we have kPk ≈ 1/ζ(s). When (i) holds, we have true
neutrality among the patches. Both the case of (i) and (ii) can be simply
explained by a Markov process for a zero-sum population, as described in
Hubbell (2001)[33]. In the cases, fs(k) ∼ Pk, and the populations are appar-
ently neutral for D. When there is true neutrality in both the populations
and the environment, Pk ≈ 1/ζ(s) ≈ Σµ(n)/ns , we will say that there is
M ¨obius neutrality. When there is apparent neutrality of D with s ∼ 1, we
will say that there is harmonic neutrality. The value of s can thus represent
the characteristic status of a system. Furthermore, consider situations in har-
monic neutrality. if the average ﬁtness w ≥ D2
s∼1, the resultant individual is
more adaptive than duplicated individuals in harmonic neutrality with s ∼ 1.
Therefore ℜ(s) > 2 is an indicator of adaptation beyond the eﬀect of ﬂuctu-
ation from the duplicated individuals with harmonic neutrality. Please also
note that µ(n) represents bosonic 1 with even number of prime multiplica-
tion, fermionic −1 with odd number of multiplication or 0 of the ‘observant’
in physics, which can be divided by prime2. The observation occurs when
two quantized particles interact. More, Madhava of Sangamagrama proved

WE: the Washidu East quadrat; WW: the Washidu West quadrat (please see Adachi (2015)[1]). Scientiﬁc names of
Dictyostelia species: P. pallidum: Polysphondylium pallidum; D. purpureum: Dictyostelium purpureum; and P. violaceum:
Polysphondylium violaceum. For calculation of ℜ(s), see the main text. N is the cell number per 1 g of soil. Species
names for Dictyostelia represent the corresponding values. a - i indicate the indices of the point quadrats. Red indicates
ℜ(s) values of species that were approximately integral numbers at or greater than 2.

in near 1400 that Σ
n:odd

(−1)(n−1)/2/n = π/4. This means that the expected
interactions of a large n number of fermions should be described as π/4. The
interaction of the two means multiplication by 2, which results in π/2 and it
appears at the next section.

3.3

Introducing ℑ(s) explains adaptation/disadaptation
of species

Next, let (s ∈ C, D ∈ C). First, we will introduce that the proposed ‘small
s’ fulﬁll the requirement from a higher dimensional theta function. Assuimg

14

H, C, R, R∗

+, R± as a higher dimensional analogue of the upper half-plane,

a complex Q C = 1
ksζ , [Q C]+ = {z ∈ C|z = ¯z}/TH (Hecke ring, R =
T theorem), |ℑ(s)| dual with |R|[95], ln|ℑ(s)|, s could be set on H and
ln|ℑ(s)| = ln(|D|E(ΣN )) = E(ΣN) ln|D| is a part of ℜ(s) = b ln|D|. H ⊆
C ⊇ R ⊇ R± ⊇ R∗
+ and the functions described here therefore are able to
constitute a theta function. The series converges absolutely and uniformly on
every compact subset of R× R× H[62], which describes a three-dimensional
nature of the system. This is based on R = T theorem and Weil’s explicit
formula (correspondence of zeta zero points, Hecke operator and Hecke ring)
and for more detailed discussion, refer Weil (1952)[95], Taylor and Wiles
(1995)[86], Wiles (1995)[98] and Kisin (2009)[39]. This model is partially
summarizable as adjunction:

R± + R∗
+i
R± −→ s
ln ↑ ր

+
Since b is real, ℜ(s) = b ln|D| and ℑ(s) = b arg D. Thus ℜ(s) is related to
the absolute value of an individual’s ﬁtness, and ℑ(s) is the time scale for
oscillations of D and is the angle multiplied by the b scale. Therefore,

= b

(16)
Note that when N = 0, |D|E(ΣN ) is indeﬁnable because actually there is no
expectation of population increase/decrease, despite it is possible to calculate
some ill-deﬁned values for |D|E(ΣN ).
When 0 < ℜ(s) < 1 and |D|′ > 0, then ℜ(s) ∼ 1, and we usually have
harmonic neutrality. This case was often prominent in the Dictyostelia data.
When 0 < ℜ(s) < 1 and |D|′ < 0, then ℜ(s) ∼ 0, and we usually have
M¨obius neutrality. When 0 < ℜ(s) < 1, the population/species can diverge
when ℑ(s) = T , that is, when it equals the imaginary part of a nontrivial
zero of ζ. Thus, the population/species can diverge when arg D = T /b. We
also note that

D = e

s

b = e

ℜ(s)

b (cos ℑ(s)
b

+ i sin ℑ(s)

),

(17)

so ℑ(s) ∼ ±m(π/2)b for quantization (compactiﬁcation of m, which is a
natural number) assuming that the distribution of population/species num-

15

bers is in equilibrium and is dependent on interactions of two as described in
the previous section; thus, |D| = eℜ(s)/b. With the Riemann-von Mangoldt
formula[93], the number of nontrivial zero points N(T ) is

N(T ) =

T
2π

log

T
2π −

T
2π

+ O(log T ),

(18)

so that T ∼ 2πe2πN (T )/T +1. On the other hand, T = ±m(π/2)b. There-
fore, for populations/species as a whole, |D|E(ΣN ) = emπℜ(s)ΣN/2T . Since the
|D|E(ΣN ) axis and the T / arg D axis are orthogonal, and the scale of the latter
is 2π times that of the former, |D|E(ΣN ) ≈ |T| (Table 2) gives a good ﬁt to
a highly adaptive population/species growth burst or collapse for an entire
population or species, and m can be calculated as

m =

1

ℜ(s)E(ΣN)

(4N(T ) +

2T
π

(ln 2π + 1)).

(19)

If we set a particular unit space for calculation of population density, ℑ(s) =
eℜ(s)E(ΣN )/b is obviously a scale invariant in species, where ℜ(s) is a scale
invariant, b is an order of (a sum of population density of a particular
species)/(the number of patches) and E(ΣN) is (a sum of population den-
sities)/(the number of pathces). In population, when b is an order of pop-
ulation density of a particular patch, it is also a scale invariant assuming
suﬃciently large number of samples are collected. Nontrivial zeros of ζ are
prime states (those related to prime numbers) and are indicators of imminent
growth bursts or collapses of the population/species. ζ can also be expressed
as in the following equation[74]:

ζ(s) = 2sπs−1 sin

πs
2

Γ(1 − s)ζ(1 − s) = 2sπs sin

πs
2

1

Γ(s) sin πs

ζ(1 − s). (20)

In order to avoid a discontinuity at a ζ zero point, ℜ(s) is likely 1/2 or an
integer. Zero points of ζ thus restrict both ℜ(s) and ℑ(s) to a particular
point by the quantization. Note that T is the imaginary parts of the ζ
zero points, which are not integers themselves in the quantization. This
model is found to be consistent with the results for some species, as shown
in Table 1; these are shown in red, as follows: (ℜ(s),ℑ(s) ≈ T, m) = (3.078,
14.99, 0.01003), (4.942, 38.74, 0.01723), (2.056, 275.5, 2.994), (2.8795, 13.80,
0.009451), (2.1411, 115.9, 0.05094), (2.9047, 13.93, 0.004941) for species.
Thus, this model gives a logical explanation for the observed quantization in

16

some situations for the Dictyostelia species, and for a population the data
seems not to be at a zero point according to the ℑ(s) value. Except the
case for (2.056, 275.5, 2.994), they are in similar situation as Bose-Einstein
condensation, which is indicated later.

WE: the Washidu East quadrat; WW: the Washidu West quadrat (please see Adachi (2015)[1]). Scientiﬁc names of
Dictyostelia species: P. pallidum: Polysphondylium pallidum; D. purpureum: Dictyostelium purpureum; and P. violaceum:
Polysphondylium violaceum. T is theoretical imaginary parts of Riemann ζ zero points corresponding to p and
ℑ(s) = |D|E(ΣN ). a - i indicate the indices of the point quadrats. T /ℑ(s) of populations are not shown because they
are so small that usually they do not correspond to each other. For calculation of p and |N(p)|, see the main text. Blank
values are undeﬁnables. Red indicates |N(p)| values of species that were approximately 2/3.

When ℜ(s) > 1 and |D|′ > 0, the population/species distribution is al-
ways structured without neutrality, since there is no zero point. On the other
hand, when ℜ(s) > 1 and |D|′ < 0, ℜ(s) ∼ 1 and harmonic neutrality usually
occurs. This is true for Dictyostelia. Usually, Dk ∼ 1 is the equilibrium state.
Therefore, populations/species reach either M¨obius neutrality or harmonic
neutrality.

It is obviously notable that assuming pk = fs(k), an ‘information en-
tropy: Ie = −Σp(n) ln(p(n))’, which is the same as Shannon index, could be
described as:
(21)

Ie = Σpk(s ln k + ln|ζ|).

That is, the expected pk = constant output of information entropy in kth
population/species is s ln k + ln|ζ|. Therefore, maximizing |ζ| by s ∼ 1
is the expected output of maximizing information entropy. The popula-
tions/species thus usually ﬂuctuate within the close proximities of s ∼ 1. If
there is no force against entropy, this is the expected future. Additionally, ap-
proaching zero points of ζ means information is minimized by approaching
negative inﬁnity, opposite to the situation in s ∼ 1 and it means order-
ing/domination. The concept described here is analogical to H = λ − Φ in

17

Arnold et al. (1994)[2], where H, λ and Φ are population entropy, growth
rate and reproductive potential, respectively. That is, λ is analogical to

gives an indicator of a distance from speciation line on ℜ(s) = 1/2. Consider-
ing ζ 2 =P∞
, ζ 2 means a sum of (probabilities that an individual of the
top populations/species replace an individual of nth population/species) ×
(the number of combinations/entanglement assuming equivalent characters
of the constitutes). This can represent expected number of entanglements
and approaching 1 when the community goes far beyond speciation phase.
Ideally the development of community starts from ℜ(s)

to a single expected status.

A virtual world of adaptation of a particular species/population is thus
represented by purely imaginary axis of small s. If we would like to calculate
synthetic ﬁtness such as (s − 1)n, we can simply took [LM , ∂∗] = i∂ where
M is the K¨ahler manifold of (s − 1) space and LM is the Lefschetz operator
[78]. Hard Lefschetz theorem represents the dimension of the space is either
in decreasing trend or increasing trend with the factor of n. Please also note
that Hasse zeta function is:

ζZ[T ](s) =Yp

(1 − p1−s)−1 = ζ(s − 1),

(25)

which is the zeta function of w = s − 1 when Z[T ] is one variant polynomial
ring.

3.4 Selberg zeta-function and Eisenstein series reveal
Maass wave form as a function of probability of
population number distribution and genetic infor-
mation

Obtaining complex metric ‘small s’ for the system, we next apply automor-
phic L-function for calculating Eisenstein series to understand the relation to
diﬀusion equation in the neutral theory and obtaining information for prime
closed geodesics in further analysis for evaluating intra-population/species
interacting mode[60]. For this application, we have to discriminate discrete
spectrum and continuous spectrum of Selberg zeta-function on small s ﬁrst.
Then we can procede to calculating Eisenstein series corresponds to the dis-
crete spectrum.

The determinant of the Laplacian of complete Selberg zeta-function is:

det(∆, s) = detD(∆ − s(1 − s))detC(∆, s),
det(∆, s) = s(1 − s), detC(∆, s) = ˆζ(2s),

(27)
where ˆζ(s) = π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s), D and C denotes discrete and continuous
spectra, respectively[60]. It is evidently true both in population and species,
discrete spectrum dominates over continuous spectrum by ∼ 103 (popula-
tions) or ∼ 10263 (species). When d is the dimension of a compact oriented
hyperbolic manifold assumed, the number of prime closed geodesics in Sel-
berg zeta-function N ′(T ) is:

(26)

N ′(T ) ∼

e(d−1)T
(d − 1)T

(T >> 1),

(28)

according to Deitmar (1989)[15].

Table S1 indicates calculated determinants, Magnus expansion/Eisenstein

series E(s) and other parameter values. E(s) is deﬁned as follows:

cause the Hessian of fM is supposed not to be 0. We would like to know

positions of Riemann ζ zero values, most promising virtual adaptation as
|D|E(ΣN ) are on purely imaginary axis of Dirac operator if Riemann hypoth-
esis is true. Indeed, in our physical model, the hypothesis is very likely to be
held as indicated later.

3.5 Geodesics of zeta-functions elucidate the mode of

interaction within the systems and its expansion

Let E be an elliptic curve over Q of a Q-approximated conductor Nc =
ln Nk/ ln k, deﬁned in the section of Price equation. If we take p as the corre-
sponding primes of each |D|E(ΣN ) values including p = 1 when π(|D|E(ΣN )) =
0, consider Hasse-Weil L-function on Nc/Q :

L(s, E) =Yp

Lp(s, E)−1,

(33)

Lp(s, E) =


(1 − anp−s + p1−2s), if p ∤ Nc or p = 1 when N(p) 6= 0,
(1 − anp−s), if p(6= 1) k Nc,
1, if p2(6= 1) | Nc or N(p) = 0.

(34)
(35)
(36)
Note that an ideal Lp(s, E) is a conductor of L(s, E)|K, when K is a ﬁnite
extension of rational Q. When Lp ∤ ∞, the global Artin conductor L(s, E)
should be 1 or -1, and the system will ﬂuctuate[62]. Considering that the
geodesic N(p) in the Selberg zeta function as Hasse-Weil L-function on Nc/Q
is:

ζΓ(s) =Yp

(1 − N(p)−s)−1.

(37)

From the observed data in Dictyostelia (Table 2), in most cases N(p)−s =
anp−s − p1−2s and |N(p)| is either 1 or 2/3 for the ﬁrst order. 95% conﬁ-
dential intervals are 0.93 ± 0.03/0.66 ± 0.01 for species and 0.991 ± 0.007
for populations. Smaller an represents a larger eﬀect and according to Table
S1, dominances of non-evolving situations independent of covariance of the
Price equation is often the case for the observed data in species, in which
a0 is the smallest coeﬃcient of Eisenstein series. For populations, a1 is al-
ways the smallest. For smallest coeﬃcients dependent on ℜ(s), the ﬁrst

21

orders are the smallests for almost all the cases, except for the case de-
scribed earlier. Note that a quartic potential Vp = φ > 0 represents already
determined passed state in ℜ(s) > 0, while Vp < 0 can represent future
state with normally divergent Eisenstein series, only converged/predictable
when [Vp = −φ, ℜ(s − 1) ≈ −1/(3φ) and ℑ(s − 1) ≈ ±e−1/(3φ)] (note that
fermionic ψ = φ(s − 1)) [52]. To support this idea, please also refer Shi-
modaira (2008)[80], in which the variations in multiscale bootstrap analysis
are expanded from positive values to negative values, rendering Bayesian na-
ture of bootstrap analysis converted to frequentist probability. Let us think
s = w + 1 situation. Because of zero-sum patch game with neutrality as
a null hypothesis assumed in our model, bootstrapping is analogical to the
situation, especially ℜ(s) > 0. With this reversing of curvature, expected
future in ℑ(s) as a Bayesian principle could be converted to frequentist as
a whole. In detail, the predictable points are usually close to the real axis,
trivial zeros of Riemann ζ (−1/3φ = −2l,ℑ(s) = 0) could predict adapta-
tion/disadaptation of the population/species of interest. This can be seen in
June of P. pallidum (s − 1 = −2.044, adaptation in next month), September
of D. purpureum (−4.148, disadaptation in next month) in Washidu East,
July of D. purpureum (−1.954, disadaptaion in next month) and October
of P. violaceum (−3.830, disadaptation in next month) in Washidu West.
In this sense, when the variation equals to zero, the bootstrapping becomes
‘machine learning’[81] and analogical to the idea ‘measurement’ in physics.
Since ℜ(s) = 0 is a natural boundary of the system, M¨obius neutrality deter-
mines what sorts of behavior one could observe in the system. It is described
that when randomly selected two integer constitutes are disjoint, the proba-
bility is 1/ζ(2) = 6/π2. Distributing it to positive and negative ℜ(s) planes
results in the probabilities of 3/π2. The probability to be an observer, which
corresponds to non-disjoint, is therefore 1 − 6/π2. That is, the probabilities
for having µ(n) = 0, 1,−1 are 1 − 6/π2, 3/π2, 3/π2. The case is very likely to
be fulﬁlled in our model and thus for non-trivial zeros of ζ, ℜ(s) = 1/2 [17].
Furthermore, absolute Riemann hypothesis can be described as:

ζh(s − α)mult(α) = 0,∞ ⇒ ℜ(s) ∈

1
2

Z.

(38)

ζh(s, ρ) =Yα

when ζh is an absolute zeta function and α ∈ Ri. In our biological model,
ζh(s, ρ) = 0,∞ means s = 0, 1 and obviously the condition is fulﬁlled.
Additionally, it is possible when p k Nc, |N(p)| = p or 2/3 ∗ p and the
population/species will be in branch cut. Nc is thus related to the informa-

22

tion of lower-hierarchy as Nk and higher-hierarchy as k, and if the ratio of
logarithms of them is a multiple of p, branch cut becomes apparent.

Next,

let us assume Q = [qa, qb, qc] = qaX 2 + qbXY + qcY 2,−qd =
q2
b−4qaqc. This assumption implies interaction mode of the subpopulations X
and Y in a particular population/species. The Hurwitz-Kronecker class num-
bers H(qd) = Σ1/wQ in a Jacobi theta function, which is a shadow of Eisen-
stein series E(s), should be |N(p)| according to trace formulae[101]. Now con-
sider modulo 4 of qd with a symmetrical case qa = qc. Unless Q = [qa, 0, qa]
or [qa, qa, qa] with wQ = 2 or 3, wQ should be 1[102]. For H(qd) = 2/3,
qa = 3, qb = 0 because qa should be an integer. Therefore there is no hetero-
|N(p)| = 2/3 mode thus represents non-
interaction of subpopulations.
interacting mode. Furthermore, we exclude the cases with 2 or 3 zeros among
qa, qb, qc because of making proper subpopulations as X, Y . |N(p)| = 1 there-
fore implies interacting mode with qa = qb = qc = 3 or non-interacting mode
with qa = qc = 2, qb = 0. We will show you later the former should be the
case. When inﬁnite generation ring Ar ⊂ C is Ar = Z[{1/2} ∪ {1/qm | qm ≡
(1 − p−s)−1 is analytic continuation
3 mod 4}], Hasse zeta ζA(s) = Qp≡1 mod 4
possible in ℜ(s) > 0 and ℜ(s) = 0 is a natural boundary[48]. Since p of
Table 2 is either 1 mod 4 or [{1/2} ∪ {1/qm | qm ≡ 3 mod 4}], 1 mod 4
part represents a characteristic ζ with M¨obius neutrality being a boundary.
[{1/2}∪{1/qm | qm ≡ 3 mod 4}] part represents inﬁnite generation ring of the
system, with a certain combination of minimum space being not isomorphic
(Bott-Shapiro Lemma, [58]). It is notable that |N(p)| = 1 case demonstrates
Lp ∤ ∞ and |N(p)| = 2/3 case demonstrates Lp|∞, therefore represent dis-
continuous and continuous course, respectively[62]. In other words, 1 mod 4
case is unique factorization domain and 3 mod 4 case is not. Looking at
Table 1, Table 2 and [1], 3 mod 4 case is described as adapted stages and 2
or 1 mod 4 case as non-adapted stages. Although in non-adaptive stages, 2
cases are likely to be Bose-Einstein condensation with maximum Ts values
as described later. Now consider odd prime p. Fields generated by p have
imaginary number i when p ≡ 1 mod 4, but not when p ≡ 3 mod 4. Since
i is related to oscillation in our model, p ≡ 1 mod 4 is still in the world of
ﬂuctuation and p ≡ 3 mod 4 is in a directional world. We will expand this
interpretation by statistical mechanics later.

3.6 Application of type IV Painlev´e equation to X 2 sys-

tem

Assume that X 2, XY, Y 2, instead of X, Y , obey Lotka-Volterra equations
equivalent to type IV Painlev´e equation:

dX 2
dt

dXY
dt

dY 2
dt

= X 2(XY −Y 2),

= −XY (X 2 +Y 2),

= Y 2(XY −X 2). (39)
The systems represents adaptive species situation in the previous section with
required symmetry. If the second equation is converted to dXY
dt = XY (X 2 +
Y 2), they become cooperative situation. If we would like to obtain ˙X, we
can simply divide the value of equation by 2X. Now let us consider N(t) =
1/X. We apply a Verhulst logistic equation model proposed in Lizama and
Mesquita (2013)[50], which is:

dN(t)

dt

= N(t)(a(t) − b(t)N(t)).

Therefore, a(t) = −XY /2, b(t) = −XY 2/2 and if we set c(t) = eY ,

N(t + 1) = N(t)

1

1+ 1

b c(t)

b(1+ 1

)

(40)

(41)

and t = b arg D if properly selected. Then consider an absolute zeta function:

ζGm/F1(s) =

s
s − 1

=

s
w

,

(42)

when Gm = GL(1). s/w is a value of s in a particular group a unit time ago.
Therefore arg w = arg D = −1/b in that case.

3.7 Application of statistical mechanics describes statis-

tics underlay in the model

The manuscript so far could demonstrate eigenvalue-like values, eigenfunction-
like functions and interaction modes of the model. From now on, statistical
mechanical concepts[24] [4] will be applied to the dynamics of populations
and species to demonstrate their macroscopic phase transitions. In this case,
distinguishable individuals with Boltzmann statistics, not indistinguishable
with Bose statistics, are considered[4]. Please note that this is not a general-
ized approach for applying statistical mechanics to ecology, but for proving

24

the existence of Bose-Einstein condensation in adaptive species. As in the
uniﬁed neutral theory[32] [33], and especially in the model of Dictyostelia
community[1], the number of individuals within a population/species is de-
noted as Nk; population has a logarithmic distribution with rank of the
number of individuals k, which is equal to the number of individuals within
a population in a particular patch. For species, the averaged numbers of
individuals of a particular species in a particular patch is calculated and the
distribution is roughly approximated to logarithm anyway to measure the
diﬀerence against population:

Nk = a − b ln k.

(43)

Let us assume a binary condition, in which +1 polarity is deﬁned as a ten-
dency for the individuals to replicate, and -1 polarity as that to die. In this
situation, a probability of +1 polarity means an increase in the population or
species, denoted as κ and -1 polarity indicates a decrease, denoted as κ′. The
overall polarities of patches are denoted as ±h. Note that the assumption
here implies cooperative increase or decrease in the number of individuals,
which is likely to be the case in biological systems. Assuming a canonical
ensemble, and the microstate probability (not microcanonical ensemble) as
Pm = e−qh, the macrostate is the sum of the states with polarity h and −h,

κ =

κ′ =

eqh
Z

,

e−qh
Z

,

Z = eqh + e−qh,

(44)

(45)

(46)

where Z is a partition function and q is a parameter.
In this context, a
Helmholtz free energy F can be set as the number of individuals. We also
assume h = F for dealing polarity of a patch with F energy as a whole.
Note that h becomes an intensive parameter within a particular patch of
intra-active population, not purely intensive as in physics. We assume the
boundary condition in this system is plus boundary condition, as required
from Lee-Yang theorem with inﬁnite volume limit of F [85]. In the theorem,
ℜ(h) > 0 is required from holomorphic condition in plus boundary condition
and it is true in the case.

25

This model was applied to actual data from both a population and a
species in order to observe the diﬀerence between them. At ﬁrst, free ener-
gies among independent individuals in a particular environment without time
development (this model neglects time) is set equal and the sum of them is
set equal to the number of individuals for simpliﬁcation. As informational
analogies with a novel assumption, we set the Gibbs free energy to be G = Nk
(individuals/g soil; this was not normalized to reﬂect the spatial scale of the
system) as a source of supplying free energy as individual living organisms;
the immigration rate is denoted by mi; the enthalpy is H = a − mib ln k,
which is not deﬁned in Harte et al. (2008)[29]; the absolute temperature
is Ts = (1 − mi)b, which can be converted to Lagrange multiplier λ1[29]
= α/Nk[23] = θ/Nk[33] = 1/(NkTs); and the entropy in this model, gen-
erally also named as ‘self-information/surprisal[89]’ of the probability that
the 1st ranked populations/species interact with the population/species of
interest, is simply ln k in each kth ranked population/species. This is diﬀer-
ent from ‘information entropy: Ie = −Σp(n) ln(p(n)); the average of overall
information entropy in the system’. The idea is similar to Dewar and Port´e
(2008)[18] when information entropy H(p||q) = −Σp ln p/q = Σ ln q with p
being a probability of the 1st ranked population/species, or to Banavar et al.
(2010)[4] when relative entropy HC−G( ~P ) ≡ −ΣPi ln Pi/P0i = Σ ln P0i with
Pi being a probability of the 1st ranked population/species. Note that Ts
is an intensive parameter within the observed intra-active community with
dependency on the scaling of N, not purely intensive as in thermodynamics.
Furthermore, the format Nk = a − b ln k is only achieved when the system
is in equilibrium, and mixing the systems does not maintain the linearity of
the parameters. Based on the immigration rate mi, the internal energy is
U = (1 − mi)a, and the emigrant population (work sent outside the system)
is equal to mi(a − b ln k). These assumptions reﬂect that G = H − TsS,
H = U + (emigrant population), entropy = ln(the number of states), and
Nk = a − b ln k. Overall, the number of individuals is analogous to the free
energy, and the rank of the population/species can be interpreted as the
information represented by the entropy. The temperature Ts is a characteris-
tic parameter of the distribution of the populations/species per gram of soil,
which reﬂects the extent of domination. For constant G and H, as the entropy
grows, Ts becomes smaller, analogous to the ﬂow of heat from a warmer to a
cooler environment; this is thus analogous to the second law of thermodynam-
ics. This is analogical to the equation P = E− ST in Arnold et al. (1994)[2],

26

where P is free energy (growth rate), E is mean energy (reproductive poten-
tial), T −1 is inverse absolute temperature (generation time τ ) and S is Gibbs-
Boltzmann entropy (population entropy −τ H). According to the theory of
statistical mechanics[24], q = 1/(1 − mi)b, Mq(Ts) = eN , and φ(q) = qF =
a/b− ln k· 1/(1− mi). Lagrangian L = (kinetic energy)− (potential energy)
of the system is thus U − (1 − mi)Nk = Ts ln k. The calculations based on
actual data for Dictyostelia[1] are shown in Table S2 (mi < 10−3 << 1 and
G ≈ F ). When N >> 1, the correlation function Cq and the spectrum
intensity Iq are deﬁned as

Cq(t) = Cq(0)e−γqt, Cq(0) =

4U 2κκ′

Iq(ω) = Cq(0)

where

Note that under low temperature (temperatures lower than critical tem-
perature), correlation function is not unique[85]. The estimated values for
U, Ts, q, κ, κ′, φ(q), γq, ω and Iq(ω) are presented in Table S2. Compared with
populations, species have more stable dynamics, and this is evident in the
values we see for γq. Noting that the time scale of the observations is a
month, we observe that populations rise and fall over a time scale of approx-
imately a week, while the time scale for species is on the order of approx-
imately three weeks. As expected[1], the climax species Polysphondylium
pallidum shows less contrast than does the pioneering species Dictyostelium
purpureum/Polysphondylium violaceum; this is evident in the value of Iq(ω).

3.8 Adaptation of species

When a system is stimulated by h = F , the polarity is

M = Nk · Z −1(eqh − e−qh) = Nk · tanh(qh).

(50)

For spontaneous polarity, we have M 6= 0. Once adapted, the averaged
polarities (Mmean = M/Nk) of the three dominant species, P. pallidum, D.
purpureum, and P. violaceum, were larger and showed better adaptation than

The parameters are described in the text. WE: the Washidu East quadrat; WW: the Washidu West quadrat [1].
Scientiﬁc names of Dictyostelia species: P. pallidum: Polysphondylium pallidum; D. purpureum: Dictyostelium purpureum;
and P. violaceum: Polysphondylium violaceum. N is the average number of cells per 1 gram of soil. Note that a
values are not based on averages, but on the actual distribution of the number of each population or species. Red in-

those of the individual averaged populations. As we see from considering the
Weiss ﬁeld h = W Mmean , Mmean is a solution of M. Note that W is an
intensive parameter within a particular intra-active patch, as is the case for
the deﬁnition of h. In a Weiss ﬁeld, Ts > W results in chaos and Ts < W
results in order, and thus W is likely to be the upper limit on Ts in the
ordering (increase) of a particular species. That is, long-range order is only
achieved under Ts < W and if Ts > W , the output is disordered chaos[85].
Ts = W is not applicable to this system, due to the mean-ﬁeld approximation
of the Weiss ﬁeld. Mmean and W are listed in Table S2; note that some results
reach the upper limit of Ts ≈ W , indicating adaptation of a particular species
denoted by the W (Table S2, red characters, we can see signiﬁcant ﬁgures of
quantization were 2-4). The value of W for the species is lower than that for
the populations, indicating that the given species is easily able to dominate
the overall population. If we set long-range order parameter per individual
as p(Ts) = M 2
mean[85], empirically p(Ts) ≤ 0.01 seems to be an indicator
of stably adapted condition (Table S2). Comparing Table 1 with Table S2,
except for (ℜ(s),ℑ(s), m) = (2.056, 275.5, 2.994), they correspond each other
and are in similar situation as Bose-Einstein condensations[85]. Basically the
distinguishable individuals ought to behave as mutually exclusive fermions,
but they could be treated as bosons when even number of fermions exists,
and in large number it can be approximated as large number of bosons. The
Bose-Einstein condensation is thus achieved in the case and seems to be the
case only for m ∼ 0.
roughly

Near the critical point Ts ≈ Tc, Mmean is small, and the susceptibility is
(51)

χT = U ′(q) ∝ |Ts − Tc|−1(Curie − Weiss law).

For the values of U ′(q) that approach inﬁnity, we show in Fig. 2 the graph of q
versus U(q). Note that in both of the quadrats in the study region (Washidu
East and Washidu West), the species we consider seem to have two phases
for any given number of individuals; for small q, there is a species domination
phase, and for large q, there is a chaotic phase without species diﬀerentia-
tion. For the populations as a whole, we note that the Washidu East and
Washidu West populations each have two phases for the total number of in-
dividuals; again, for small q, there is a domination phase, for large q, there
is a chaotic phase of individuals. We averaged three temperatures from each
quadrat that were close to U ′(q) as it approaches inﬁnity and determined that
the critical temperature is Tc = 2090 ± 50 (95% conﬁdence) for the popula-

tions and 1500 ± 500 for species. This indicates that when Ts >∼ 2090, one
population can uniquely dominate; when Ts ∼ 1500 − 2090, no population
dominates, but a species can uniquely dominate. When Ts <∼ 1500, neither
populations nor species dominate, and the system is chaotic, although the
tendency of populations and species to increase still remains for Ts < W .
These results are consistent with those obtained by considering the Weiss
ﬁeld, W . Noe that the critical point Tc and Weiss ﬁeld W are diﬀerent ideas:
the former represents discontinuity in overall phase, and the latter represents
the conversion between ordered and disorders states[85]. Above the critical
temperature for species, conversion between dominating species phase and
increasing population phase are continuous, not discrete[85]. The domina-
tion phases and tendency to increase for each population or species is shown
in Fig. 3.

Furthermore, Ts < Tc increases the internal energy:
E(Ts) = − ¯N h tanh(qh) ≈ − ¯N qh2,

(52)

when ¯N is the averaged Nk over pathces in populations or Nk in species.
Ts > Tc results in E = 0, and Ts < Tc gives E proportional to Tc − Ts. The
speciﬁc heat Cs(= ∂E/∂Ts|h=0) is 0 at or above Tc, it is ﬁnite at or below
the Tc, and it has a sudden increase at Tc. Usually, species have higher in-
ternal energy than do populations. The critical point can be determined by
using data speciﬁc to a given species; note that there are several phases for
population and species, including domination, increasing, and chaos.

Introducing large S, an order parameter

For the population space deﬁned above and the volume of the system V = 1
for 1 gram of soil, we deﬁne S near the critical points such that

f{S} = f0 + A′S2 + B′S4 − h′S,

(53)

where f = F ≈ G is the Hamiltonian; h′ is the ﬂow of the population from
outside; f0, A′, and B′ are coeﬃcients approximated by an expansion and
assuming B′ > 0 and A′ = A′′(Ts − Tc), where A′′ is another approximated
coeﬃcient. In equilibrium,

∂f
∂S

= 4B′S3 + 2A′′(Ts − Tc)S − h′ = 0,

(54)

and the solution is the order parameter. When h′ = 0, S = 0 is the only
solution of Ts > Tc. An additional solution, S ≈ ±(Tc − Ts)1/2, exists
when Ts < Tc, with h′ breaking the symmetry. The isothermal suscepti-
bility is χT ≈ |Ts − Tc|−1. When Ts = Tc, we have S ≈ h′1/3. When C0 =
−Ts∂2f0/∂T 2
s , we have speciﬁc heat Cs = C0 at Ts > Tc, Cs = TsA′′2/2B′
at Ts < Tc, and a jump at Ts = Tc. The calculated values of S are listed in
Table S2. The results indicate that there is a tendency towards order when
a population or species dominates.

3.10 Development of the model by web-based formal-

ism

Here we will introduce analogy to supersymmetry in physics to describe a
time-developing system of our model. First, consider Bochner’s conjecture:
when φ is a characteristic function of probability, following three conditions
are necessary and suﬃcient; (I) |φ|/2 is a positive constant; (II) |φ(ℜ(s))|/2
is continuous when ℜ(s) = 0; (III) |φ(0)|/2 = 1. Therefore φ(−ℜ(s)) =
φ(ℜ(s)). Then we introduce “transactional interpretation” [11] in quantum
physics as explaining time-symmetry in our model. Thus we can develop a
supersymmetry matrix

1

F1 : φ(−ℜ(s))

2(cid:18) F4 : φ(ℜ(s))

F2 : −φ(−ℜ(s)) F3 : φ(ℜ(s)) (cid:19) ,

where combinations of F4/F1 and F3/F2 are advanced/retarded waves and
the determinant 1
2(F4F3-F1F2) is ‘past - future’. φ(ℜ(s))/φ(−ℜ(s)) rep-
resent absorber/observer and −φ(−ℜ(s))/φ(ℜ(s)) are emitter/observant, in
which φ(ℜ(s)) is past and −φ(−ℜ(s)) is future. Note that in complex-base
system, (−1 + i)-adic system can represents whole complex number, while
(1 − i)-adic system cannot [42]. More, only −n ± i can represent the whole
complex number when n is natural. Thus F1 of the observer represents the
information of all the possibilities of future, while already observed F4 cannot
represent the whole, indicating the asymmetry of past and future by these
correspondences. Despite being all the possibilities considered at past, the
future of observant is restricted to a certain possibility.
In the same way,
F2 cannot represent the whole, while F3 can. This is the opposite corre-
spondence of observant to observer. The system as a sum of the matrices
above is obviously SU(2). Since the system is also a K¨ahler manifold, 4-
dimensional Riemann manifold of the system becomes a Ricci-ﬂat K¨ahler
manifold/Calabi-Yau manifold[43]. The system also has Riemann curvature
tensors with self-duality, being 2-dimensional Ising model[85]. Furthermore,
it is supposed to be asymptotically locally ﬂat. φ space therefore is instan-
(Φ − e−iN ϑ ΦNk +1
ton.
Nk+1 )
(Φ = φi), this is analogical to φ − instanton equation described in Gaiotto
et al. (2015)[26]:

where x is a variant denotes genetic information, τ is time and gIJ is a metric
tensor. ℜ(φ−1Wz) and ℑ(φ−1Wz) are the Hamiltonian and the potential of
the system, respectively. Assuming the uniﬁed neutral theory, Φ itself is a
quantum critical point. This is because within-population system, it is sup-
posed to be in equilibrium with the highest adaptation in ordered state and
the lowest value of critical temperature Tqc = 0. Thus each individual in the
population has an equal role. When a vacuum weight vij = vi − vj where
vi = φWz i, the worldline is parallel to vij. The vacuum conﬁgurations Φi and
Φj exhibit a boundary of each critical point/state. When eiθ Wji
|Wji| = φ, Φi is a
boosted soliton of stationary soliton Φj and they will deﬁne edges of webs[26].

3.11

Implication of the model as nine-dimensional sys-
tem

The situation that |N(p)| is 1 or 2/3 suggests that the model described here
implicates N = 2 supersymmetry with 3 dimensions. As the previous subsec-
tion introduced supersymmetry, we would like to introduce 3 dimensionality
in the model. We need the equation in K´arolyh´azy (1966)[35] (This is the
original work, however, with serious misprint. See [36] for introduction of
the equation in detail):

(∆Φ)2 ≈ Λ4/3Φ2/3.

(56)

For application of the equation, we need the parameter analogical to the
speed of light and the uncertainty principle. For the speed of light, let us
remind:

∂ℜ(s)
∂t

= b

(57)

(58)

(59)

This is analogical to Hubble’s law of H(t) as the Hubble parameter:

∂|D|
∂t

.

1
|D|

with

dD
dt

= H(t)D,

∂ℜ(s)
∂t

= bH(t).

Note that max(dD/dt) = |D|E(ΣN ) for the observed system. The parameter
value analogical to the speed of light is therefore |D|E(ΣN ).

34

For the uncertainty principle, it can be described as ∆D∆pm ≥ /2,
where pm = Mmass ˙D. We can set  = 1.
If we set Mmass = H(t)−1 =
φ ≈ constant, D = 1 + ∆Nk, and the uncertainty principle should be simply
(∆∆Nk)2 ≥ 1, obviously fulﬁlled in the system with changing D. Since
|dD/dt| = |D|E(ΣN ) is only achieved when φ = 0, the requirement from the
analogy to photon is well equipped.
Now let |Φ| = Nk/E(ΣN) ∝ Ts in equilibrium. If G is an analogue of
gravitational constant, We can put the planck scale Λ = pG/|D|3E(ΣN ).
When φi is a mass from internal populations and φe is that from external
populations, we can set Vp = GMiMe/D ≈ φi. G = D/φe = 1/(φe −
∆φe) ≈ constant (φ/D = P DNk−1 = φ−∆φ), and Λ2 ≈ constant. Therefore
(∆Φ)3 ∝ Φ, that is, Φ is the third power of its ﬂuctuation assuming DE(ΣN ) =
constant. If we apply N = 2 supersymmetry with 3 dimensional Ising model
in Bobev et al. (2015)[7], the kink △ = |N(p)| = 2/3 and the superpotential
W = Φ3. The dimension in the Ising should be 3. Then consider Stefan-
Boltzmann law. Since entropy density sd = 4U/3Ts ∝ T 3
s , the total number
of dimension in sd ∝ W based on ﬂuctuation is therefore 9, similar to the case
in superstring theories. Note that W and sd are in opposite direction. We
can also set 3 dimensional fermionic Grassmann number similar to a string
theory if we assume zero-sum patch game of the uniﬁed neutral theory, when
we are considering ﬁtness w. The model describing future gives Eisenstein
series in the condition, as wQ = 3[52]. Overall, based on the requirements
from W = Φ3 and wQ = 3, wQ should be 3 and |N(p)| = 1 should be in the
interacting mode.
Additionally, according to Steinhardt and Turok (2004)[84], for a universe
with constant ǫ, the scale factor a(t) and the Hubble radius H(t)−1 are related
by the Friedmann equations:

a(t) ≈ t1/ǫ ≈ (H(t)−1)1/ǫ.

(60)

Let us set ǫ ≡ 3/2∗(1+̟). In this system, (̟ > 1|−1/3 < ̟ ≤ 1|̟ ≤ −1/3)
show (contraction/oscillation/expansion) of the universes. Since ǫ = 1/△,
|N(p)| = 1, 2/3 show expansion/oscillation of the universes. Therefore the
former mode represents expansion, and reaches the latter mode with oscilla-
tion, not with expansion.

4 Discussion

4.1 PzDom model

We call this the patch with zeta-dominance model (PzDom). Under the
eﬀects of entropy, the populations/species are assumed to ﬂuctuate near
ℜ(s) ∼ 1 or ζ = 0. However, there is another solution. From the results
shown in Fig. 1, ℜ(s) = 2 seems to be the border between the population
and species for Dictyostelia.
Indeed, also in ecological data set of ruderal
vegetation in Rodr´ıguez et al. (2013b)[76], we can deduce the data is from
opportunistic species because most parts ℜ(s) ≥ 2. On the other hand, ma-
rine interstitial meiofauna of sandy beaches and tropical rocky shore snails
should be from populations, or at least from equilibrium ‘species’, because
of ℜ(s) < 2. As described, adaptation can be deﬁned as the suﬃcient ﬁt-
ness that goes beyond the ﬂuctuation of harmonic neutrality and the border
is ℜ(s) = 2. From the data, we also see that species with larger values of
s/D have greater ﬁtness. Since the world in which ℜ(s) > 1 results in ab-
solute convergence of ζ, the species world is not a chaotic world, but there
is structure in the community that depends on adaptation and hysteresis.
It is obvious that from original Price equation, ℜ(s) > 1 means cov > 0
and the species/population is on the diverging course for characteristics. In
contrast, the part of population world (0 < ℜ(s) < 1) is chaotic. It is also
obvious that from original Price equation, ℜ(s) < 1 means cov < 0 and the
species/population is on converging course for characteristics. Output of the
developed system is unpredictable when Ts < Tc, because of non-uniqueness
of the inﬁnite volume limit of the system [85]. This might be the case for
simulated sympatric “speciation” in de Aguiar et al. (2009)[13].

Although ℜ(s) may be continuous except that populations/species are
adapted to the observed environments, each species has some discrete char-
acteristic variables. These are required by the quantization of D by T , and
they imply adaptation (resp. disadaptation) and a population/species burst
(resp. collapse) in a particular environment. Because environmental variables
are always continuous, genetic/epigenetic characters are responsible for the
discreteness of D. That is, either a discrete genetic/epigenetic background
or biological hierarchies rendering discrete characteristics at a higher scale
are demanded by T . Spectra of Selberg zeta-function also reveals discrete
nature of both population and species, but they are based on prime closed
geodesics not necessarily related with adaptaion/disadaptation. This means

36

populations can behave in either discrete way or pseudo-continuous way of re-
dundancy. Therefore prime numbers could be related with adaptive species,
and prime closed geodesics with high degeneracy could be related to popula-
tion. Since the number of primes is on the order of T ln T and that of closed
geodesics is e(d−1)T /T , the number of prime closed geodesics is much more
than the number of primes, demonstrating the correspondence to population
and species. Analogically it is predicted that in eukaryotic ‘species’ adapta-
tion is well correlated with speciation, while prokaryotic discreteness is not
so easily distinguished from populational discreteness. This might be a can-
didate proof of discreteness of phenotypes observed among living organisms
in nature [72], and it might be important to test |N(p)| value to distinguish
which hierarchical dynamics is observed in the set of data of interest. It is pos-
sible that if Mathieu group corresponds to mock modular form such as Maass
form, the dimension of the system can be calculated by Eisenstein series (for
M24, e.g. Eguchi et al. (2010)[22]). Assuming that the K3 (s with an inter-
action) surface is a holomorphic symplectic symmetry group, it is a subgroup
of the group M24[61]. Now let us think an oscillative part of an Eisenstein
series: e2πinℜ(s). First, consider a (1+i)-adic system. Since πm/4 = 2πnℜ(s),
m should be a multiple of 8 if ℜ(s) is quantized as Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion. In contrast, a (−1+i)-adic system results in 3πm/4 = 2πnℜ(s) and 3m
should be a multiple of 24 as Bose-Einstein condensation. Non-typical quan-
tization with m ∼ 2 observed thus might presumably represent population
burst/collapse not in equilibrium. When the system is an output of an inter-
action of two, this can be decomposed to 4 and 12, respectively. If we think
an observed state, 4-dimension is enough. However, it cannot represent the
every possibility. Considering all the unobserved possibilities, 12-dimension
(with ﬂuctuations) can represent the whole.
In other words, classically, if
we set Liouville’s equation ∂∂φ = 2πµφbφe2bφφ, P 2 = 2πµφbφ, D = ebφand
Weil-Petersson metric becomes ds2
φ = e2bφφdkdk = constant (e.g. [21]) with
negative Ricci curvature. Uniformization theorem describes any Teichm¨uller
space uniquely deﬁnes solutions[67][40][68][69][44][45][46], especially genus
number 3 on closed Riemann surface with 12 real dimensions. When quantum
dilogarithm function is eb, ideal tetrahedron is ψ(Zψ) = eb(Zψ/2πbφ + iQψ/2)
when qa = ∞, qb = 1, Zψ = ln k (e.g. [87]), representing three dimensions +
time dimension with three-dimensional ﬂuctuations (ﬂuctuations from other
three dimensions of a dimension of interest) in each. In this way, an expan-
sion of PzDom model to time-developing system should have 12 dimensions.
To support this idea, (a, b, k) system could be SO(3) and Vogel’s parameters

37

for simple Lie algebra g are: α = −2, β = 4, γ = −1, t = h∨ = 1[59]. If we
set a half sum of positive roots ρ = 1 as interacting two positive roots of 1,
Freudenthal-de Vries strange formula becomes 12ρ2 = h∨dim g = dim g = 12
(also refer [59]), remarking the relation between interaction of the objects and
time development. More simply, consider wk = s − 1 = −1 when a natural
boundary s = 0. Then φ = 1/kwk|ζ(wk)| = 12k and in the top ranking pop-
ulation/species, the degree of freedom on the ﬁtness at a natural boundary
should be 12.

Note that these quantizations are the situations observed in chaotic spe-
ciation worlds if ℜ(s) ∼ 1/2, not the species world. If ℜ(s) > 2, it is the
phenomena in structured species world.
If there are two subgroups in populations/species with the frequency of
X/Y , note that w = w0 + BY − CX when w0 is the ﬁtness without beneﬁt
from interactions, B is the beneﬁt of X from Y and C is the cost of X from
the interaction. Since |D|E(ΣN ) is the most promising virtual beneﬁt from
non-interacting individuals, it is w0 and ℜ(s)−1 is the overall ﬁtness from the
interaction. ℜ(s) > 1 thus results in cooperative world of higher ﬁtness and
0 < ℜ(s) < 1 results competitive world with population burst/collapse with
discrete characteristics. Ordered symbiosis might be involved in ℜ(s) > 1
and chaotic mutual exclusion/speciation might be involved in 0 < ℜ(s) < 1.
This is also supported by the analysis of geodesics. When ℜ(s) − 1 < 0
for signiﬁcantly long duration that is not observed in Adachi (2015)[1], it is
possible to be qb < 0 (for example |N(p)| = 1/3 with contracting universe; qb
is a coeﬃcient of XY in Zagier (2000b)[102] and the populations/species is
harmed by competition. The case is similar to Chern-Simons action SCS[100]:

SCS =

kCS

4π ZM

tr(A ∧ dA +

2
3

A ∧ A ∧ A),

(61)

where kCS is the integer level of theory with zero ﬁeld strength in all the
boundaries. A can represent X 2, XY, Y 2 vectors and the weight of the ﬁrst
term in the trace should be 0 in adaptive situations when X and Y are depen-
dent. It should be +1/3 in cooperative situations and −1/3 in competitive
situations. Chern-Simons theory thus describes the action in PzDom model,
and the time derivative of the action is the Lagrangian of the system. Since
the Lagrangian is Ts ln k, when k = constant, dSCS/dt· dTs = Ts ln kdTs and
dSCS = ln k
6 arg D t3 =
(arg D)2
ln kT 3
s when

2 arg D t2. Therefore when arg D = constant, R R dSCSdt = ln k
s and if arg D = π,R R dSCSdt = ζ(2) ln kT 3

s ∝ sd = 4

3abT 3

38

U = abT 4 in black-body radiation, which populations/species intend to go
beyond. sd is thus the volume of non-Euclidean sphere with Ts radius, when
ab = Cc/dc with Cc: circumference and dc: its diameter. Please also note that
1/ζ(2) is a probability that two randomly selected integers are disjoint. That
is, ln kT 3
s multiplied
by a relative entropy.

s is an expected scale of interacting R R dSCSdt that is T 3

There is another way of setting the Lagrangian on fermion as

L = i ¯ψ ˙ψ − ǫ ¯ψψ = |D|2(i ln ˙|D| − ǫ).

(62)

If ǫ → 0, Ts → |D|2 and ˙|D| → k, simplifying the calculation.

where hH = −s. iℑ(s)/b = iπ/2( mod iπ) have regular singularities, as

of species.
Interestingly, if we set a p-adic ﬁeld F of p not being 2 or 3, root 3
only exist in F with necessary and suﬃcient condition p ≡ 1 or 11 mod 12.
Therefore if we stick to 3 dimension constituted by an interaction of identical
constitutes, p ≡ 1 or 11 mod 12 should be satisﬁed and it demonstrates
symmetry of the following equations. Srinivasa Ramanujan considered in his
unpublished manuscript (1916?) the equation:

and FR, ∆R correspond to 1, 11 dimensions of the term p. Please note
that both FR and ∆R regard interaction of two identical decomposition of 12
dimensions, multiplied by qR. E : y2 + y = x3−x2 means y(y + 1) = x2(x−1)
and if the time of phenomenon proceeds from y to y + 1, the interaction
decreases from interacting x2 to non-interacting decreased (x − 1).
When ℜ(s) − 1 > 0, either cooperative qb > 0 with ℜ(s) < 2 or qb = 0
with ℜ(s) > 2 without harm in equilibrium seems to be achieved. Thus,
(i) chaotic
the status of ℜ(s) world is roughly separated in three cases:
0 < ℜ(s) < 1 with mutual exclusion/speciation; (ii) ordered 1 < ℜ(s) ≤ 2
with cooperation; (iii) most adaptively ordered ℜ(s) > 2 with stability and
no interaction (oscillating “nirvan
a” state). According to Fermat’s last the-
˙
orem, non-interacting mode of subpopulations with qb = 0 is only achieved
when X n + Y n = Z n with n ≤ 2. It is predicted that possible non-interacting
mode with nirvan
a state continuously observed is only for the second order.
˙
Note that nirvan
a is regarded as the state for domination of most dominant
˙
species over other rarer species in a particular set of species in particular
time and is not regarded as the situations in individual species. It is also
notable that when environment is stable, nirvan
a state is also stable. How-
˙
ever, when the environment changes signiﬁcantly, species in previous nirvan
a
˙
state is no longer in a nirvan
a state and it will fall into chaotic state, render-
˙
ing interactions involving competition, cooperation and starvation-induced
sexual reproduction with others in such a crisis. Therefore out of nirvan
a
˙
state, a species have to interact with other species. Furthermore, co-evolving
communities among diﬀerent niches cannot be described in this model: this
is the limit of our study.
It is notable that in the same niche regarded,
non-interacting nirvan
a is the best state of domination by a species. Then
˙
consider Euler-Mascheroni constant:

lim
s→1

(ζ(s) −

1
s − 1

) = γ = 0.577....

(68)

When k = 1, |ζ(s)| = E(ΣN)/N1 and in a population, it is 0.5. Therefore
w < 0 and in a long run, the population is decreasing. In a species, when
N1 << E(ΣN) in a speciation phase, w > 0. Even when N1 ≈ E(ΣN), w > 0

40

and investing a higher-order species concept breaks the limit of decreasing
trend.The discussion here is summarized in Fig. 4.

It is well expected that in nirvan
˙

a state, mutual exclusions of genetic in-
formation from diﬀerent species is achieved via reproductive isolation mecha-
nisms based on uniparental chromosome elimination, which is often the case
in Bains and Howard (1950)[3], Fujiwara et al. (1997)[25] and Marinoni et
al. (1999)[53].

Interestingly, Demetrius (2006)[16] suggests that scaling exponents that
refer to the ratios of the fractional changes in metabolic rates to a change in
body size among opportunistic species, such as annual plants and small ani-
mals, are 2/3 (see also White and Seymour (2003)[96]), while among equilib-
rium ‘species’ they are 1 for perennial plants and 3/4 for large animals. These
values are similar to |N(p)| in our model, though in his model it is assumed
that Euclidean surface area rules entail a unique minimal scaling exponent
related to energy transduction localized in biomembranes. In our model, the
objects are not metabolites related to biomembranes, and the assumption
is not required, despite it is still possible for metabolites both of his and
our assumptions meet well as the same value. Furthermore, in “Implication
of the model as nine-dimensional system”, we showed a(t) ≈ (Mmass)|N (p)|.
It might be interesting to survey |N(p)| = 3/4 case (though 3/4 value is
(2001)[20]), or to extend our study from Dic-
doubted in Dodds et al.
tyostelian populations/species to lower order hierarchies such as individ-
ual/organic/tissue/cellular/organellar/molecular metabolisms. Hubble’s law
might be a common to understand the background logic of diﬀerent hierar-
chies.

4.2 General implications of the statistics

In this study, we present new metrics: Tc, W and S, for distinguishing be-
tween populations and species, based simply on knowledge of the total num-
ber of individuals. We thus demonstrated spontaneous symmetry breaking
of the biological system. S describes the extent of ordering based on domi-
nation. The metrics presented here can also successfully evaluate the critical
point Tc and Weiss ﬁeld W . They can distinguish between diﬀerent ordering
states, such as a random distribution, a dominant species or population, their
potential phase transitions, and adaptations (Ts ≈ W ). Ts ≈ W situation

is a biological application of Bose-Einstein condensation[85]. Similar con-
densation phenomena is theoretically described in Knebel et al. (2015)[41].
Besides the case described in Knebel et al. (2015)[41], we are also able to
describe quantization with a case not in typical Bose-Einstein condensation.
These are shown in Fig. 3. The phase separation showed depending on the
levels of biological hierarchies, such as a population and a species, we can
evaluate the adaptive structures allowed during evolution in each phase: for a
population domination phase, a single population could dominate over com-
munity; for a species domination phase, not a population but a sum of the
same species in community could dominate. The increasing phases denote
introductions to each domination phase. Additionally, we cannot be sure of
the output in chaotic phase. When relative information entropy is maximized
with absolute randomness or chaos, there is no order. On the other hand,
when relative information entropy is minimized with uniform distribution,
there is no pattern.

The model also shows that some highly adapted species are more sta-
ble than others. Furthermore, the zero points of the Riemann zeta function
correspond to the adaptive species and also to prime numbers. The en-
tropy ln k, which was introduced in this manuscript, can be approximated
by π(k)/k ≈ 1/ ln k, where π(k) is the prime counting function. The decrease
in the prime number density along with the growth of entropy means that
the tendency to decrease is only broken when higher-order hierarchies exists.
Thus, for these organisms, higher-order hierarchies may serve as investments
in adaptive ordering structures.

Now let us look into biological hierarchies from genes, cells, multicellular
individuals, populations to species. For genes and cells, if we restrict the
surrounding environments as smaller scales such as cells or individuals, the
copy numbers of genes and cells are nearly static, and they are not adaptive
anymore. Thus Ts ∼ 0 for these cases. The individuals surrounded by popu-
lations or populations itself are, however, in chaotic situations with Ts 6= 0.
Our data suggest that species level is more adaptive than lower order hier-
archies. For example, in Fig. 3, dark blue shading indicates a ‘population
domination’ phase for species dynamics as a whole, because in this regard
whole sum of population should be considered as ‘a species’ world; light blue,
dark green and light green indicate a ‘populational chaos’ phase. We thus
conclude that reproductive scales are chaotic, and to achieve adaptation, we
need higher order hierarchies. For lower order hierarchies, they are in most
adaptive situations and we have to extend the observed environmental scales

43

from lower ones to higher ones such as species, communities or ecosystems,
in order to detect the selections to genes or cells themselves.

Implications of the parameters

What are the assumed parameters representing? D represents the relative
individual ﬁtness, which varies over time and depends on a particular ge-
netic/environmental background and the interactions between individuals.
P is the relative patch quality, which a relative environmental variable and
also depends on the backgrounds of the occupying species; in particular, it
may diﬀer by dominant species for the same environment.

If B is the beneﬁt to an organism of participating in a cooperative system

and C is the cost of that participation, then D is deﬁned by

D = 1 +

B − C

and number of populations of Mp[88],

On the other hand, if the autozygosity of a neutral haploid organism and the
eﬀective population size are Fa and Ne[64], respectively, then

Fa =

(73)

when ν <<1 is the mutation rate per genotype per generation. Furthermore,
when ˆN is the average number of high-ﬁtness one-step neighbors per high-
ﬁtness individual in the population, and d is a dimensionality[91], then

D = ¯w = 1 − ν +

(75)

In Dictyostelia[1], N ∼ 1, Mp ∼ 104, ν ∼ 10−8, and (B−C)/C ∼ 10−4 among
individual and patches, and N/d is thus ∼ 104. For metapopulation (a set
of local populations that are linked by dispersal) and species, N ∼ 108,
Mp ∼ 109, ν ∼ 10−25, and (B − C)/C ∼ 10−2, and ˆN /d is thus ∼ 1023.
Assuming that N is the number of individuals within a population and Mp is
the number of populations within a metapopulation, MpN is the maximum
number of individuals within a metapopulation or the minimum number of
individuals within a species (Mspe ). When N/Mp is at its maximum,

Therefore, Mspe ∼ 1020. The equations in this subsection agree well with the
values given in the previous paragraph.

4.4 Evolution of hierarchy

How does the hierarchies of an eukaryotic living organism, such as popula-
tion, metapopulation (a set of local populations that are linked by dispersal)
or species, arise at all? What is the connection between ‘genetical close re-
lationships’ and the observed diﬀerent dynamics of populations/species? In
the context of biological species concept of Mayr (1942)[54], a species is de-
ﬁned as “groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations,
which are reproductively isolated from other such groups”.
In this light,
Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model[6] [19] [65], whose hybrid inviabilities in
speciation are originated by incompatibilities among mutations in at least
two loci, is a convincing idea for the mechanism underlay in speciation pro-
cess without adaptation (We do not think speciation with adaptation in this

45

section for simplicity based on neutral process). If we assume all these ideas
are proper to describe actual speciation processes without adaptation, we can
adopt the model for the evolution of cancer originated by mutations in tumor
suppressor genes (TSG, please note this is not a model for carcinogenesis and
the mutations are neutral until both of alleles in diploids are mutated) for
modeling also in speciation.

In TSG model, a normal cell has two alleles of a tumor suppressor gene,
which is similar to a combination of hybrid incompatibility genes. If both of
the genes are mutated in a hybrid, hybrid inviability will occur. According
to Michor et al. (2004)[57], the whole system can be modeled by only three
parameters: the population size N; the mutation rate for the ﬁrst hit u1; and
the mutation rate for the second hit u2. They assume exact Markov process
in the model[57] and described the process as:

P (t) = 1 −

(N < 1/√u2, two rate limiting for very short times),

Nu2e−u1t − u1e−N u2t

Nu2 − u1

P (t) = 1 − exp(−Nu1√u2t)

(1/√u2 < N < 1/u1, one rate limiting),

P (t) = 1 − exp(−Nu1u2t2/2)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(N > 1/u1, zero rate limiting because of constantly produced mutated

cells),

when P is probability for producing speciated individuals and t is time. These
three classiﬁcations of population sizes are well applicable to the evolution
of hierarchies as followings.

Let us assume that reproductive isolations by mutations in hybrid in-
viability genes are responsible for evolution of species without adaptation.
In Dictyostelium discoideum, the mutation rate is supposed to be ∼ 10−8
/site/generation[1]. Since Dictyostelia are haploid organisms, there is no
contribution to mutations from mitotic recombination and u1 ∼ u2 ∼ 10−8.
The square root of them is ∼ 10−4. If the population size is below 104, the
evolution of species is supposed to be two rate limiting steps as suggested.

46

This meets well with actual population size of a patch, which is [< 104][1]. A
single mutation in clonal isolation genes, such as in tgr genes that determine
aggregation compatibility among the cells[31], might be responsible for this
level of hierarchy. If the population size is between 104 to 108, the evolu-
tion of species is supposed to be one rate limiting steps. This meets well
with actual sizes of a population in maximum and a metapopulation, which
are ∼ 104 and ∼ 108, respectively[1]. If the population size is > 108, there
is no rate limiting step and reproductively isolated populations, which is a
higher hierarchy of metapopulation, is likely to evolve. Population should
be clonally identical, and ﬁrst hit should be occurred during population to
metapopulation stage. Furthermore, second hit and ﬁxation of species would
occur during supra-metapopulation stage. Typical time scale for speciation
from each criteria is ∼ 1 million years for a population, ∼ 100 years for a
metapopulation and ∼ 10 days for Izu supra-metapopulation, which meet
well with Adachi (2015)[1]. Virtually the kinetics of evolution in populations
could be described as three phases, the latter two of which are in linear re-
lation between log N and log t.

5 Conclusions

We have successfully applied Price equation, R = T theorem and Weil’s
explicit formula to ecological model named PzDom model, by introducing
a new parameter ‘small s’. The border of adaptive species and chaotic
populations/species is ℜ(s) = 2, and the values of prime closed geodesics
are |N(p)| = 2/3 and |N(p)| = 1, respectively. mod 4 of ℑ(s) reveals
adaptive/disadaptive situations together with Bose-Einstein condensations.
Futures of individuals as adaptation/disadaptation are also partially pre-
dictable. We showed that by assuming only maximizing information entropy,
we could calculate the normalized ﬁtness and cost-beneﬁt ratio, together with
the required autozygosity, in competitive or cooperative populations/mainly
non-interacting adaptive species from the distribution of population/species
abundance. Furthermore, we showed that it is a natural consequence of
species adaptation as primes or population conversion as geodesics to ob-
serve phenotypic discontinuity during maximization of information entropy.
The model is able to prove the existence of biological ‘phases’ of population
and species speciﬁc to each. The phases therefore distinguish and predict

47

diﬀerent natures of population and species based on population/species dy-
namics/distribution. Assuming clonal isolation and hybrid inviability, we can
develop a model of forming hierarchies per se. This is a summary of ground
map for future to understand the nature of hierarchical system.
