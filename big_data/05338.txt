Abstract

A tree T in an edge-colored graph H is called a monochromatic tree if all the
edges of T have the same color. For S ⊆ V (H), a monochromatic S-tree in H is
a monochromatic tree of H containing the vertices of S. For a connected graph G
and a given integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|, the k-monochromatic index mxk(G) of
G is the maximum number of colors needed such that for each subset S ⊆ V (G)
In this paper, we prove that
of k vertices, there exists a monochromatic S-tree.
for any connected graph G, mxk(G) = |E(G)| − |V (G)| + 2 for each k such that
3 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|.
A tree T in a vertex-colored graph H is called a vertex-monochromatic tree
if all the internal vertices of T have the same color. For S ⊆ V (H), a vertex-
monochromatic S-tree in H is a vertex-monochromatic tree of H containing the
vertices of S. For a connected graph G and a given integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|,
the k-monochromatic vertex-index mvxk(G) of G is the maximum number of colors
needed such that for each subset S ⊆ V (G) of k vertices, there exists a vertex-
monochromatic S-tree. We show that for a given a connected graph G, and a
positive integer L with L ≤ |V (G)|, to decide whether mvxk(G) ≥ L is NP-complete
for each integer k such that 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|. We also obtain some Nordhaus-

Introduction

All graphs considered in this paper are simple, ﬁnite, undirected and connected. We follow

the terminology and notation of Bondy and Murty [1]. A path in an edge-colored graph H

is a monochromatic path if all the edges of the path are colored with the same color. The

graph H is called monochromatically connected if for any two vertices of H there exists

a monochromatic path connecting them. An edge-coloring of H is a monochromatically

connecting coloring (MC-coloring) if it makes H monochromatically connected. How

colorful can an MC-coloring be? This question is the natural opposite of the well-studied

problem of rainbow connecting coloring [4, 6, 10, 12, 13], where in the latter we seek

to ﬁnd an edge-coloring with minimum number of colors so that there is a rainbow path

joining any two vertices. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic connection number

of G, denoted by mc(G), is the maximum number of colors that are needed in order to

make G monochromatically connected. An extremal MC-coloring is an MC-coloring that

uses mc(G) colors. These above concepts were introduced by Caro and Yuster in [5].

They obtained some nontrivial lower and upper bounds for mc(G). Later, Cai et al.

in

[2] obtained two kinds of Erd˝os-Gallai-type results for mc(G).

In this paper, we generalizes the concept of a monochromatic path to a monochromatic

tree. In this way, we can give the monochromatic connection number a natural generaliza-

tion. A tree T in an edge-colored graph H is called a monochromatic tree if all the edges
of T have the same color. For an S ⊆ V (H), a monochromatic S-tree in H is a monochro-
matic tree of H containing the vertices of S. Given an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (H)|,
the graph H is called k-monochromatically connected if for any set S of k vertices of H,

there exists a monochromatic S-tree in H. For a connected graph G and a given integer
k such that 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|, the k-monochromatic index mxk(G) of G is the maximum
number of colors that are needed in order to make G k-monochromatically connected. An

edge-coloring of G is called a k-monochromatically connecting coloring (MXk-coloring)

if it makes G k-monochromatically connected. An extremal MXk-coloring is an MXk-

coloring that uses mxk(G) colors. When k = 2, we have mx2(G) = mc(G). Obviously,
we have mx|V (G)|(G) ≤ . . . ≤ mx3(G) ≤ mc(G).

There is a vertex version of the monochromatic connection number, which was intro-

duced by Cai et al. in [3]. A path in a vertex-colored graph H is a vertex-monochromatic

path if its internal vertices are colored with the same color. The graph H is called

monochromatically vertex-connected, if for any two vertices of H there exists a vertex-

monochromatic path connecting them. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic

vertex-connection number of G, denoted by mvc(G), is the maximum number of colors that

are needed in order to make G monochromatically vertex-connected. A vertex-coloring

2

of G is a monochromatically vertex-connecting coloring (MVC-coloring) if it makes G

monochromatically vertex-connected. An extremal MVC-coloring is an MVC-coloring

that uses mvc(G) colors. This k-monochromatic index can also have a natural vertex

version. A tree T in a vertex-colored graph H is called a vertex-monochromatic tree if
its internal vertices have the same color. For an S ⊆ V (H), a vertex-monochromatic
S-tree in H is a vertex-monochromatic tree of H containing the vertices of S. Given
an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (H)|, the graph H is called k-monochromatically vertex-
connected if for any set S of k vertices of H, there exists a vertex-monochromatic S-tree
in H. For a connected graph G and a given integer k such that 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|, the
k-monochromatic vertex-index mvxk(G) of G is the maximum number of colors that are

needed in order to make G k-monochromatically vertex-connected. A vertex-coloring of G

is called a k-monochromatically vertex-connecting coloring (MV Xk-coloring) if it makes

G k-monochromatically vertex-connected. An extremal MV Xk-coloring is an MV Xk-

coloring that uses mvxk(G) colors. When k = 2, we have mvx2(G) = mvc(G). Obviously,
we have mvx|V (G)|(G) ≤ . . . ≤ mvx3(G) ≤ mvc(G).

A Nordhaus-Gaddum-type result is a (tight) lower or upper bound on the sum or

product of the values of a parameter for a graph and its complement. The Nordhaus-

Gaddum-type is given because Nordhaus and Gaddum [14] ﬁrst established the following

inequalities for the chromatic numbers of graphs: If G and G are complementary graphs

on n vertices whose chromatic numbers are χ(G) and χ(G), respectively, then 2√n ≤
χ(G) + χ(G) ≤ n + 1. Since then, many analogous inequalities of other graph parameters
are concerned, such as domination number [9], Wiener index and some other chemical

indices [15], rainbow connection number [7], and so on.

In this paper, we will prove that for any connected graph G, mxk(G) = |E(G)| −
|V (G)| + 2 for each k such that 3 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|. For the vertex version parameter
mvxk(G), we ﬁrst show that for a given a connected graph G, and a positive integer L
with L ≤ |V (G)|, to decide whether mvxk(G) ≥ L is NP-complete for each integer k such
that 2 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|. Then, we obtain some Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results.

2 Determining mxk(G)

Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and m edges.
In this section, we mainly
study mxk(G) for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. A straightforward lower bound for mxk(G)

3

is m − n + 2. Just give the edges of a spanning tree of G with one color, and give each
of the remaining edges a distinct new color. A property of an extremal MXk-coloring
is that the edges with each color forms a tree for any k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. In fact, if an
MXk-coloring contains a monochromatic cycle, we can choose any edge of this cycle and

give it a new color while still maintaining an MXk-coloring; if the subgraph induced by

the edges with a given color is disconnected, then we can give the edges of one component
with a new color while still maintaining an MXk-coloring for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.
Then, we use color tree Tc to denote the the tree consisting of the edges colored with c.

The color c is called nontrivial if Tc has at least two edges; otherwise c is called trivial.

We now introduce the deﬁnition of a simple extremal MXk-coloring, which is generalized

of a simple extremal MC-coloring deﬁned in [5].

Call an extremal MXk-coloring simple for a k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n, if for any two nontrivial
colors c and d, the corresponding Tc and Td intersect in at most one vertex. The following

lemma shows that a simple extremal MXk-coloring always exists.

Lemma 2.1. Every connected graph G on n vertices has a simple extremal MXk-coloring
for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.

Proof. Let f be an extremal MXk-coloring with the most number of trivial colors for
each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. Suppose f is not simple. By contradiction, assume that c and
d are two nontrivial colors such that Tc and Td contain p common vertices with p ≥ 2.
Let H = Tc ∪ Td. Then, H is connected. Moreover, |V (H)| = |V (Tc)| + |V (Td)| − p,
and |E(H)| = |V (Tc)| + |V (Td)| − 2. Now color a spanning tree of H with c, and give
each of the remaining p − 1 edges of H distinct new colors. The new coloring is also an
MXk-coloring for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. If p > 2, then the new coloring uses more
colors than f , contradicting that f is extremal. If p = 2, then the new coloring uses the

same number of colors as f but more trivial colors, contracting that f contains the most

number of trivial colors.

By using this lemma, we can completely determine mxk(G) for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.
Theorem 2.2. Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and m edges, then mxk(G) =
m − n + 2 for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.

Proof. Let f be a simple extremal MX3-coloring of G. Choose a set S of 3 vertices of G.
Then, there exists a monochromatic S-tree in G. Since |S| = 3, then this monochromatic

4

S-tree is contained in some nontrivial color tree Tc. Suppose that the color tree Tc is not
a spanning tree of G. Choose v /∈ V (Tc), and {u, w} ⊆ V (Tc). Let S′ = {v, u, w}. Then,
there exists a monochromatic S′-tree in G. Since |S′| = 3, then this monochromatic S′-
tree is contained in some nontrivial color tree Td. Moreover, since v /∈ V (Tc), then c 6= d.
But now, {u, w} ∈ V (Tc) ∩ V (Td), contracting that f is simple. Then, we have that Tc is
a spanning tree of G. Hence, m − n + 2 ≤ mxn(G) ≤ . . . ≤ mx3(G) ≤ m − n + 2. The
theorem thus follows.

3 Hardness results for computing mvxk(G)

Through we can completely determine the value of mxk(G) for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n,
for the vertex version it is diﬃcult to compute mvxk(G) for any k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
In this section, we will show that given a connected graph G = (V, E), and a positive
integer L with L ≤ |V |, to decide whether mvxk(G) ≥ L is NP-complete for each k with
2 ≤ k ≤ |V |.

We ﬁrst introduce some deﬁnitions. A subset D ⊆ V (G) is a dominating set of G if
every vertex not in D has a neighbor in D. If the subgraph induced by D is connected,

then D is called a connected dominating set. The dominating number γ(G), and the

connected dominating number γc(G), is the cardinalities of a minimum dominating set,

and a minimum connected dominating set, respectively. A graph G has a connected

dominating set if and only if G is connected. The problem of computing γc(G) is equivalent

to the problem of ﬁnding a spanning tree with the most number of leaves, because a vertex

subset is a connected dominating set if and only if its complement is contained in the set
of leaves of a spanning tree. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices where n ≥ 3. Note
that the problem of computing mvxn(G) is also equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding a

spanning tree with the most number of leaves. In fact, let Tmax be a spanning tree of

G with the most number of leaves, and l(Tmax) be the number of leaves in Tmax. Then,
mvxn(G) = l(Tmax) + 1 = n − γc(G) + 1 for n ≥ 3. For convenience, suppose that all the
graphs in this section have at least 3 vertices.

Now we introduce a useful lemma. For convenience, call a tree T with vertex-color c

if the internal vertices of T are colored with c.

Lemma 3.1. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices with a cut-vertex v0. Then,

mvc(G) = l(T0) + 1, where T0 is a spanning tree of G with the most number of leaves.

5

Proof. Let f be an extremal MV C-coloring of G. Suppose that f (v) is the color of the
vertex v, and f (v0) = c. Let G1, G2, . . . , Gp be the components of G− v0 where p ≥ 2. We
construct a spanning tree T0 of G with vertex-color c as follows. At ﬁrst, choose any pair
(vi, vj) ∈ (V (Gi), V (Gj))(i 6= j). Since v0 is a cut-vertex, then there must exist a {vi, vj}-
path P containing v0 with vertex-color c. Initially, set T0 = P . Secondly, choose another
pair (vs, vt) ∈ (V (Gs), V (Gt))(s 6= t) such that vs is not in T0. Similarly, there must exist a
{vs, vt}-path P ′ containing v0 with vertex-color c. Let x be the ﬁrst vertex of P ′ that is also
in T0, and y be the last vertex of P ′ that is also in T0. Then, reset T0 = T0∪ vsP ′x∪ yP ′vt.
Thus, T0 is still a tree with vertex-color c now. Repeat the above process until all vertices

are contained in T0. Finally, we get a spanning tree T0 of G with vertex-color c. Thus, we
have mvc(G) ≤ l(T0) + 1 now. However, mvc(G) ≥ mvxn(G) = l(Tmax) + 1, where Tmax
is a spanning tree of G with the most number of leaves. Then, we have l(T0) = l(Tmax).

Hence, it follows that mvc(G) = l(T0) + 1.

Corollary 3.2. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices with a cut-vertex. Then,
mvxk(G) = l(Tmaz) + 1 for each k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, where Tmax is a spanning tree of
G with the most number of leaves.

Now, we show that the following Problem 0 is NP-complete.

Problem 0: k-monochromatic vertex-index

Instance: Connected graph G = (V, E), a positive integer L with L ≤ |V |.
Question: Deciding whether mvxk(G) ≥ L for each k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V |.

In order to prove the NP-completeness of Problem 0, we ﬁrst introduce the following

problems.

Problem 1: Dominating Set.

Instance: Graph G = (V, E), a positive integer K ≤ |V |.
Question: Deciding wether there is a dominating set of size K or less.

Problem 2: CDS of a connected graph containing a cut-vertex.

Instance: Connected graph G = (V, E) with a cut-vertex, a positive integer K with
K ≤ |V |.
Question: Deciding wether there is a connected dominating set of size K or less.

The NP-completeness of Problem 1 is a known result in [8]. In the following, we will

6

reduce Problem 1 to Problem 2 polynomially.

Lemma 3.3. Problem 1 (cid:22) Problem 2.

Proof. Given a graph G with vertex set V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and edge set E, we construct
a graph G′ = (V ′, E′) as follows:

V ′ =V ∪ {u1, u2, . . . , un} ∪ {x, y}
E′ =E ∪ E1 ∪ E2
E1 ={uiv : if v = vi or viv is an edge in G for 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
E2 ={xui : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ∪ {xy}

It is easy to check that G′ is connected with a cut-vertex x. In the following, we will show
that G contains a dominating set of size K or less if and only if G′ contains a connected

dominating set of size K + 1 or less. On one hand, suppose w.l.o.g that G contains a
dominating set D = {v1, v2, . . . , vt}, t ≤ K. Let D′ = {u1, u2, . . . , ut} ∪ {x}. Then, it is
easy to check that D′ is a connected dominating set of G′ and |D′| ≤ K + 1. On the other
hand, suppose that G′ contains a connected dominating set D′ of size K + 1 or less. Since
x is a cut-vertex of G′, then x ∈ D′. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, if ui ∈ D′ or vi ∈ D′, then put vi in
D. It is easy to check that D is a dominating set of G and |D| ≤ K.
Theorem 3.4. Problem 0 is NP-complete.

Proof. Given a connected graph G = (V, E) with a cut-vertex, and a positive integer K
with K ≤ |V |. Since γc(G) ≤ K if and only if mvxk(G) = l(Tmax) + 1 = |V |− γc(G) + 1 ≥
|V | − K + 1 for 2 ≤ k ≤ |V |, where Tmax is a spanning tree of G with the most leaves
by Corollary 3.2. Then, given a connected graph G = (V, E) with a cut-vertex, and a
positive integer L with L ≤ |V |, to decide whether mvxk(G) ≥ L is NP-complete for each
k with 2 ≤ k ≤ |V | by Lemma 3.3. Moreover, Problem 0 is NP-complete.
Corollary 3.5. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices. Then, computing mvxk(G) is
NP-hard for each k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n.

4 Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for mvxk

Suppose that both G and G are connected graphs on n vertices. Now for n = 4, we have
G = G = P4. It is easy to check that mvxk(P4)+mvxk(P4) = 6 for each k with 2 ≤ k ≤ 4.

7

Fig. 1: The graph F1 with γc(F1) = γc(F1) = 3.

For k = 2, Cai et al. [3] proved that for n ≥ 5, n + 3 ≤ mvc(G) + mvc(G) ≤ 2n, and the
bounds are sharp. Then, in the following we suppose that n ≥ 5 and 3 ≤ k ≤ n.

We ﬁrst consider the lower bound of mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) for each k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.

Now we introduce some useful lemmas.

Lemma 4.1. [11] If both G and G are connected graphs on n vertices, then γc(G) +

γc(G) = n + 1 if and only if G is the cycle C5. Moreover, if G is not C5, then γc(G) +
γc(G) ≤ n with equality if and only if {G, G} = {Cn, Cn} for n ≥ 6, or {G, G} = {Pn, Pn}
for n ≥ 4, or {G, G} = {F1, F1}, where F1 is the graph represented in Fig.1.

Lemma 4.2. [3] Let Cn be a cycle on n vertices. Then,

mvc(Cn) =(n n ≤ 5
3 n ≥ 6.

Recall that a vertex-monochromatic S-tree is a vertex-monochromatic tree containing

S. For convenience, if the vertex-monochromatic S-tree is a star (with the center v),

we use S-star (Sv-star) to denote this vertex-monochromatic S-tree. For two subsets
U, W ⊆ V (G), we use U ∼ W to denote that any vertex in U is adjacent with any vertex
in W . If U = {x}, we use x ∼ W instead of {x} ∼ W .

From Lemma 4.1, we have mvxk(Cn) + mvxk(Cn) ≥ mvxn(Cn) + mvxn(Cn) = 2n −
(γc(Cn) + γc(Cn)) + 2 ≥ n + 2 for n ≥ 6 and k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n.
It is easy to check
that mvxk(Cn) = 3 for n ≥ 6 and k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n by Lemma 4.2. Then, we have
mvxk(Cn) ≥ n − 1 for n ≥ 6 and k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. Now we introduce the following
lemma.

Lemma 4.3. For n ≥ 6, if n is odd, then mvxk(Cn) = n for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n−1
mvxk(Cn) = n − 1 for k with n+1

2 , and
2 ≤ k ≤ n; if n = 4t, then mvxk(Cn) = n for k with

8

2 − 1, and mvxk(Cn) = n − 1 for k with n

3 ≤ k ≤ n
mvxk(Cn) = n for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n

2 , and mvxk(Cn) = n − 1 for k with n

2 ≤ k ≤ n; if n = 4t + 2, then
2 + 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

2 ≤ k ≤ n. Hence, mvxk(Cn) = n − 1 for k with n+1

Proof. Suppose that V (Cn) = {v0, v1, . . . , vn−1}, and the clockwise permutation sequence
is v0, v1, . . . , vn−1, v0 in Cn. Let f be an extremal MV Xk-coloring of Cn for each k with
3 ≤ k ≤ n. Suppose ﬁrst that n is odd. Let S = {vi : i ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4)}. Then, |S| =
n+1
2 . It is easy to check that there exists no S-star in Cn. Then, we have mvxk(Cn) < n
for k with n+1
2 ≤ k ≤ n. For k
with 3 ≤ k ≤ n−1
2 , we will show that mvxk(Cn) = n. In other words, for any set S of k
vertices of Cn, there exists an S-star in Cn. We ﬁrst show that mvxk(Cn) for k = n−1
2 .
By contradiction, assume that mvxk(Cn) < n for k = n−1
2 . Suppose that S is a set of k
vertices such that there exists no S-star in Cn. Note that the vertex-induced subgraph
, . . . , Pvip vjp} where {viq, vjq} denote
Cn[S] consists of some disjoint paths {Pvi1 vj1
the ends of Pviq vjq such that the vertex-sequence viq to vjq along Pviq vjq is in clockwise
direction in Cn for each q with 1 ≤ q ≤ p.

, Pvi2 vj2

Claim 1: Each Pviq vjq contains at least 2 vertices for each q with 1 ≤ q ≤ p.
Proof of Claim 1: By contradiction, assume that Pviq vjq = v for some v ∈ V (Cn)
, . . . , Pvip vjp} are disjoint paths in Cn, then v ∼ S \ {v} in Cn.

now. Since {Pvi1 vj1
Hence, there exists an Sv-star in Cn, a contradiction.

Consider {Pvi1 vj1

in Cn.
where 1 ≤ q ≤ p, we have the following

= Pvi1 vj1

Claim 2: There are at most 2 vertices between {vjq, viq+1} in clockwise direction in

Cn for each q with 1 ≤ q ≤ p.

Proof of Claim 2: By contradiction, assume that there are at least 3 vertices
{vr−1, vr, vr+1}, where the subscript is subject to modulo n, between {vjq, viq+1} in clock-
wise direction in Cn. Now, we have vr ∼ S in Cn. Then, there exists an Svr -star in Cn, a
contradiction.

If n = 4t + 1, then k = 2t. Now, we have p ≤ ⌊ k

2⌋ = t by Claim 1. Then, |V (Cn)| ≤
k+2p ≤ n−1 < n by Claim 2, a contradiction. If n = 4t+3, then k = 2t+1. Now, we have
p ≤ ⌊ k
2⌋ = t by Claim 1. Then, |V (Cn)| ≤ k + 2p ≤ n− 2 < n by Claim 2, a contradiction.

Hence, if n is odd, then n = mvx n−1

2

(Cn) ≤ . . . mvx4(Cn) ≤ mvx3(Cn) ≤ n. The proof

for the case n = 4t or n = 4t + 2 is similar. We omit their details.

Theorem 4.4. Suppose that both G and G are connected graphs on n vertices. For n = 5,
mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ 6 for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ 5. For n = 6, mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ 8 for
k with 3 ≤ k ≤ 6. For n ≥ 7, if n is odd, then mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 3 for k with
3 ≤ k ≤ n−1
2 ≤ k ≤ n; if n = 4t, then
mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 3 for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n
2 − 1, and mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 2
for k with n
2 ≤ k ≤ n; if n = 4t + 2, then mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 3 for k with
3 ≤ k ≤ n
2 + 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Moreover, all
the above bounds are sharp.

2 , and mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 2 for k with n+1

2 , and mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ n + 2 for k with n

Proof. For n = 5, if G = G = C5, then it is easy to check that 2mvxk(C5) = 6 for k with
3 ≤ k ≤ 5; if G 6= C5, then mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ 7 for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ 5 by Lemma
4.1. For n ≥ 6, we have mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≥ mvxn(G) + mvxn(G) = n + 2 for k with
3 ≤ k ≤ n with equality if and only if {G, G} = {Cn, Cn} for n ≥ 6, or {G, G} = {Pn, Pn}
for n ≥ 6, or {G, G} = {F1, F1}, where F1 is the graph represented in Fig.1 by Lemma
4.1. For n ≥ 6, it is easy to check that mvxk(Cn) = mvxk(Pn) = 3 for k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n
by Lemma 4.2. Then, we have mvxk(Pn) + mvxk(Pn) ≥ mvxk(Cn) + mvxk(Cn) for k with
3 ≤ k ≤ n. Furthermore, for n = 6, it is easy to check that mvxk(F1) + mvxk(F1) = 8 for
k with 3 ≤ k ≤ 6. Thus, the theorem follows for n ≥ 6 by Lemma 4.3.

Now we consider the upper bound of mvxk(G)+mvxk(G) for each k with ⌈ n

2⌉ ≤ k ≤ n.
For convenience, we use dG(v) and NG(v) to denote the degree and the neighborhood of
a vertex v in G. For any two vertices u, v ⊆ V (G), we use dG(u, v) to denote the distance
between u and v in G. Note that a straightforward upper bound of mvxk(G) is that
mvxk(G) ≤ mvc(G) ≤ n − diam(G) + 2 where diam(G) is the diameter of G for each k
with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. Next we introduce some useful lemmas.
Lemma 4.5. Let Kn1,n2 be a complete bipartite graph such that n = n1 + n2, and n1, n2 ≥
2. Let G = Kn1,n2 − e, where e is an edge of Kn1,n2. Then, mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) = 2n− 2
for 3 ≤ k ≤ n.

Proof. It is easy to check that diam(G) = 3, and diam(G) = 3. Then, we have mvc(G) +
mvc(G) ≤ 2n − 2. It is also easy to check that both G and G contain a double star as a

spanning tree. Then, we have mvxn(G) + mvxn(G) ≥ 2n − 2. Hence, the lemma follows
by the fact that mvxn(G) ≤ . . . ≤ mvx3(G) ≤ mvc(G).
Lemma 4.6. If k = ⌈ n

2⌉, then mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≤ 2n − 2 for n ≥ 5.

Proof. Let V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. Since G is connected, then ∆(G) ≤ n − 2. Suppose
ﬁrst that mvxk = n, and f is an extremal MV Xk-coloring of G. Then, for any set S of
k vertices of G, there exists an S-star in G. This also implies that ∆(G) ≥ k − 1.

Case 1: ∆(G) ≥ n − k + 1.
Suppose w.l.o.g that dG(v1) = ∆(G), and NG(v1) = {v2, v3, . . . , v∆+1}. Let S =
{v1, v∆+2, . . . , vn−1, vn}. Since |S| = n − ∆(G) ≤ k − 1 < k, then there exists an Sv-star
in G. Moreover, since v1 ≁ {v∆+2, . . . , vn−1, vn} in G, then v ∈ NG(v1). Suppose w.l.o.g
that v = v2. Then, we have dG(v1, v2) ≥ 3. Since dG(v1, v2) ≥ 3, then mvxk(G) ≤
n − diam(G) + 2 ≤ n − 1. Suppose mvxk(G) = n − 1. Then, diam(G) = 3. Let g
be an extremal MV Xk-coloring of G. Note that if G is k-monochromatically vertex-
connected, it is also monochromatically vertex-connected. Since mvxk(G) = n − 1, then
there exists a vertex-monochromatic path P = v1xyv2 of length 3 in G such that x ∈
{v∆+2, . . . , vn−1, vn}, and y ∈ NG(v1) \ {v2}. Suppose w.l.o.g that P = v1v∆+2v∆+1v2.
This also implies that v∆+1 ≁ {v2, v∆+2} in G. Let S′ = {v1, v∆+1, v∆+2, . . . , vn} now.
Since |S′| = n − ∆(G) + 1 ≤ k, then there exists an S′
v′-star in G. Moreover, since
v1 ≁ {v∆+2, . . . , vn−1, vn} and v∆+1 ≁ {v2, v∆+2} in G, then v′ ∈ NG(v1) \ {v2, v∆+1}.
Now, we have dG(v1, v′) = 3. Since mvxk(G) = n − 1, then {v∆+1, v∆+2} are the only
two vertices with the same color in G. But now, since v′ ≁ {v∆+1, v∆+2} in G, then there
exists no vertex-monochromatic path connecting {v1, v′} in G, a contradiction. Hence,
we have that mvxk(G) ≤ n − 2, and mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≤ 2n − 2.

Case 2: ∆(G) ≤ n − k.
Since k = ⌈ n
If n is odd, then ∆(G) = n−1

2⌉, and ∆(G) ≥ k − 1, then ⌈ n

2⌉ − 1 ≤ ∆(G) ≤ n − ⌈ n
2⌉.

2 = k − 1. Suppose w.l.o.g that dG(v1) = ∆(G), and
NG(v1) = {v2, v3, . . . , vk}. Let S = {v1, vk+1, . . . , vn}. Since |S| = n − k + 1 = k, then
there exists an Sv-star in G. Moreover, since v1 ≁ {vk+1, . . . , vn−1, vn} in G, then v is not
in S. But now, dG(v) ≥ |S| = k > ∆(G), a contradiction.

If n is even, then ∆(G) = n

2 − 1 or n
NG(v1) = {v2, v3, . . . , v∆+1}. If ∆(G) = n

2 . Suppose w.l.o.g that dG(v1) = ∆(G), and
2 − 1 = k − 1, then let S = {v1, vk+1, . . . , vn−1}.

11

Since |S| = n − k = k, then there exists an Sv-star in G. Moreover, since v1 ≁
{vk+1, . . . , vn−1} in G, then v is not in S. But now, dG(v) ≥ |S| = k > ∆(G), a contradic-
tion. If ∆(G) = n
2 = k, then let S = {v1, vk+2, . . . , vn}. Since |S| = n − k = k, then there
exists an Sv-star in G. Moreover, since v1 ≁ {vk+2, . . . , vn−1, vn} in G, then v ∈ NG(v1).
Suppose w.l.o.g that v = v2. Then, dG(v2) = k = ∆(G), and NG(v2) = {v1, vk+2, . . . , vn}
now. If k ≥ 4, then let S′ = {v1, v2, vk+1, vk+2}. Since |S′| ≤ k, then there exists an S′
v′-
star in G. But now, since v1 ≁ vk+2, and v2 ≁ vk+1 in G, then v′ ∈ NG(v1) ∩ NG(v2) = ∅,
a contradiction. If k = 3, then n = 6 now. If {v2, v3, v4} ∼ {v5, v6} in G, then G contains
a complete bipartite spanning subgraph. But now, G is not connected, a contradiction.
So, suppose w.l.o.g that v4 ≁ v5 in G. Similarly consider S′ = {v1, v3, v5},{v1, v4, v5},
{v1, v4, v6}, and {v3, v5, v6}, respectively. Then, we will have that v3 ∼ v5, v3 ∼ v4,
v4 ∼ v6, and v5 ∼ v6 in G, respectively. But now, G is contained in a cycle C6. Then,
mvx3(G) ≤ mvx3(C6) = 3. So, for n = 6 we have mvx3(G) + mvx3(G) ≤ n + 3 < 2n − 2.
Now suppose w.l.o.g that mvxk(G) ≤ n− 1, and mvxk(G) ≤ n− 1, respectively. Thus,

we also have mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≤ 2n − 2.
Theorem 4.7. Suppose that both G and G are connected graphs on n ≥ 5 vertices. Then,
for k with ⌈ n
2⌉ ≤ k ≤ n, we have that mvxk(G) + mvxk(G) ≤ 2n − 2, and this bound is
sharp.

Proof. For k with ⌈ n
From Lemma 4.5, this bound is sharp for k with ⌈ n

2⌉ ≤ k ≤ n, we have mvxk(G) ≤ mvx⌈ n
2⌉ ≤ k ≤ n.

2 ⌉ ≤ 2n − 2 by Lemma 4.6.
