We consider the quantum processor based on a chain of trapped ions to propose an architecture
wherein the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions (position and momentum) could be ex-
ploited as the computational Hilbert space. We adopt a continuous-variables approach to develop
a toolbox of quantum operations to manipulate one or two vibrational modes at a time. Together
with the intrinsic non-linearity of the qubit degree of freedom, employed to mediate the interaction
between modes, arbitrary manipulation and readout of the ionic wave function could be achieved.

The current paradigm of implementations of quantum
computing consists in the coherent manipulation of dis-
crete two-level systems, the qubits, by sequences of quan-
tum gates [1]. Ion traps stand as one of the most suc-
cessful experimental implementations of a quantum pro-
cessor, a system for which all basic elements required
for computation universality have been demonstrated in
proof-of-principle experiments [2–4] and scalability is not
unlikely [5, 6].

A chain of ions trapped in a harmonic potential func-
tions as a quantum register wherein each ion encodes one
qubit in energy eigenstates of its electronic conﬁgura-
tion [7]. The external conﬁnement and the electric repul-
sion among ions give rise to collective modes of vibration
which are employed to mediate the interaction between
any chosen pair of qubits. Quantum operations are ac-
complished by resonant or near-resonant laser pulses with
the qubit transitions. Other internal energy levels of the
ions are employed to initialize and measure the qubits.
Even though the speciﬁcs of this manipulation scheme
has evolved enormously since its inception [3, 8–11], it
would not be inappropriate to name it as the ‘Cirac &
Zoller (CZ) paradigm’ of ion trap quantum computing.
In short, the CZ paradigm has each ion storing a sin-
gle qubit in internal electronic energy levels and diﬀerent
qubits interacting via the quantum information ‘bus’ pro-
vided by one or more motional modes.

An alternative route to quantum computation consid-
ers physical observables with continuous spectra – con-
tinuous variables (CV) – to realize the physical encoding
and manipulation of quantum information [12, 13].
In
the continuous variables quantum computing (CVQC)
paradigm, Gaussian states and operations are usually
considered as the building blocks of quantum logic [14,
15], as well as a single non-Gaussian operation needed to
achieve universality [16, 17]. The basic physical object
of quantum computing is embedded in this case in an
inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space. And although it may

∗ lortiz@df.ufpe.br

be regarded as continuous in the eigenbasis of certain
observables, it can many times also be understood as a
discrete conﬁguration space in the eigenbasis of other ob-
servables. More concretely, as considered in this paper,
a vibrational mode of the ion chain [18–22] can be either
described in the continuous phase space of position and
momentum observables, e.g. by the Wigner function, or
in terms of superpositions of the quantized energy eigen-
states of the harmonic oscillator, the number or Fock
states [23]. The generation, control [24–26] and measure-
ment [27–29] of vibrational modes have been approached
in the recent literature in various ways: by entangling
them with optical resonator modes [30], using them as
equivalent models for the study of vibrational states of
optomechanical systems [31], by generating exotic quan-
tum states [32, 33], or by implementing quantum simu-
lations of solid state systems [34–36].

In this paper, we investigate the idea of exploiting the
vibrational modes of trapped ions as the physical plat-
form of quantum computing, i.e.
for the implementa-
tion of quantum gates in the motional modes of vibra-
tion [37, 38]. We consider the feasibility and particular-
ities of inverting the CZ paradigm to employ the qubit
degree of freedom as the mediator of interaction among
a set of motional modes of vibration. Even though our
proposal can be extended to a system of diﬀerent singly
trapped ions [39], we focus here on the simplest case of
a single trapped ion and its corresponding set of three
vibrational modes as a starting point. By following this
approach, we try to establish the potential capabilities
brought by this minimalistic quantum system and the
likely limitations on the size of the conﬁguration space
made available by this simple change of perspective in
the use of the ion trap. We develop a CV quantum com-
putation toolbox to manipulate each of the single modes
and to make them interact in pairs, in particular to show
that conditional dynamics (entangling gates) would be
available. The proposed quantum gates are realizable by
bichromatic laser ﬁelds with tunable frequencies. Read-
out of the quantum state can be performed using number-
dependent Rabi ﬂops on the qubit [40–42].

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. I, we present
the quantum processor based on the ion trap and recall
the basic manipulation of a single trapped ion by an ex-
ternal laser source. Sec. II presents the CV quantum
gates that can be realized in the motional modes with
bichromatic laser ﬁelds. We detail our CVQC proposal
and develop the necessary toolbox of quantum gates in
Sec. III. Our concluding remarks follow in Sec. IV.

I. BASIC IMPLEMENTATION

A. Physical system

In this proposal, the physical objects to be manipu-
lated are the diﬀerent oscillation modes of a quantum
harmonic oscillator. There are three available modes in
the simplest case of a single trapped ion oscillator. The
size of the Hilbert space associated with each vibrational
mode and available to manipulation in actual experimen-
tal conditions is better quantiﬁed in the eigenbasis of the
number operators. The basis for each mode is assumed
to be truncated at a maximum phonon number N , and
is hence composed of the eigenstates

{|0i,|1i,|2i, . . . ,|Ni}.

(1)

FIG. 1. Proposal of CVQC using the ion trap. (a) The CZ
paradigm employs one or more motional modes of the quan-
tum harmonic oscillator to mediate the interaction (the ‘quan-
tum bus’) between pairs of qubits. In the original proposal,
one motional mode is essentially employed as a two-level sys-
tem. Increasing the size of the Hilbert space requires adding
more ions to the physical system, reaching an exponential in-
crease. (b) Our proposal utilizes the qubit as the quantum bus
that allows vibrational modes to interact. Three harmonic
oscillator form the Hilbert space available for manipulation.
The size of the Hilbert space available is outright larger than
in the CZ paradigm, although it increases only polynomially
with the phonon cap number.

The representation of the quantum state in terms of
phonon number eigenstates refers to a ‘particle-like’ de-
scription of the quantum system. The quantum state
of the harmonic oscillator also admits a CV representa-
tion in the position and momentum phase space, a ‘wave-
like’ description employing the Wigner function. In phase

2

space, quantum gates are transformations of the Wigner
function.
In the ion trap processor, they can be per-
formed by coupling vibrational modes to the qubit (in-
ternal) degree of freedom by means of bichromatic laser
light [8, 9, 43, 44]. The qubit is by construction a highly
non-linear physical system – one that saturates with a
single quantum –, a property here employed to generate
non-Gaussian operations on the vibrational modes. Since
in our proposed ion trap CVQC architecture the qubit is
only an auxiliary source of non-linearity and coupling
among motional modes, the desired quantum operations
must start and end with quantum states ˆρ which are sep-
arable in the qubit ˆρq and motional modes ˆρm, i.e. we
impose that ˆρ = ˆρq ˆρm before and after the application of
quantum gates.

The CV toolbox of quantum operations to be de-
veloped below can be separated in Gaussian and non-
Gaussian operations. The class of Gaussian operations
maintains as Gaussian an initially Gaussian Wigner func-
tion. There are single- and two-mode Gaussian opera-
tions. Single-mode displacements and squeezers respec-
tively displace the origin of phase space or the scaling of
the position and momentum axis. Both of them have al-
ready been experimentally demonstrated in the ion trap
processor [45, 46]. Two-mode operations comprise the
beam splitter and the two-mode squeezer. The beam
splitter is a passive transformation that linearly combines
two ﬁeld modes. The two-mode squeezer, an active trans-
formation, can be understood as two single-mode squeez-
ers simultaneously acting on orthogonal combinations of
two modes. One can also include two-mode conditional
gates as generalizations of such operations.

B. Hamiltonian of the ion trap

Our CVQC toolbox is built upon the simplest imple-
mentation of an ion trap processor: a single ion furnishes
the qubit and three independent modes of vibration. We
consider in this section the basic coherent manipulation
of a single trapped ion by an external source of coherent
light [23, 47].

To establish notation, we recall below the elementary
dynamics of one qubit and two motional modes coupled
to it by a monochromatic external laser. The general-
ization of the interaction to three oscillator modes and
bichromatic lasers capable of producing the desired quan-
tum gates follows next.

The ion trap Hamiltonian reads in this case as

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆHI ,

(2)

where ˆHI is the interaction Hamiltonian discussed below
and ˆH0 provides the free dynamics of qubit and motional
modes,

ˆH0 = 1
2

ω0ˆσz + ωaˆa†ˆa + ωbˆb†ˆb.

(3)

The qubit transition frequency is ω0 and its two-
dimensional Hilbert space is described in terms of the

excited |ei and ground |gi internal states of the ion, with
which we write ˆσz = |eihe|−|gihg|. The two independent
vibrational modes under consideration are described in
terms of the annihilation operators ˆa and ˆb and the re-
spective creation operators satisfying the commutation
relations [ˆa, ˆa†] = [ˆb, ˆb†] = 1. Their oscillation frequen-
cies are ωs, where s ∈ {a, b} denotes the mode.
The simplest model of interaction Hamiltonian ˆHI =
− ~d · ~E comprises a dipolar coupling between the ion and
an external coherent light source. The atomic dipole
operator is ~d = ~µ(ˆσ+ + ˆσ−), with dipole moment ~µ
and operators ˆσ+ = |eihg| and ˆσ− = |gihe|. The
light source drives the ion by means of the electric ﬁeld
~E = ~E0 exp(i~k · ~r − iωLt) with wavevector ~k and fre-
quency ωL. The interaction Hamiltonian can be made to
account for the free evolution associated with ˆH0 (inter-
action picture), yielding

˜HI = 1

+ iηb(ˆbe−iωbt + ˆb†eiωbt)] + h.c.,

where δ = ωL − ω0 is the radiation-atom detuning, Ω =
|~µ· ~d|/ is the Rabi frequency, and ηs = kxs cos θ are the
Lamb-Dicke parameters, deﬁned in terms of the typical
scale of the ground state oscillator wavefunction xs =

p/(2mωs) and the direction of propagation θ of the

laser with respect to the direction of vibration of mode s.
Typical experimental conditions in optical qubits imply
ηs ≪ 1, values for which the Lamb-Dicke regime can be
evoked to expand the interaction Hamiltonian in powers
of ηs.

The CV quantum gates we consider in the next section
are obtained by expanding the interaction Hamiltonian
up to second order in ηs, as

˜HI = ˆH (0) + ηa ˆH (1)

The eﬀect of each Hamiltonian is easily understood in the
Fock basis of the motional states. The single-quantum
saturation associated with the qubit degree of freedom
plays the fundamental role of allowing the coherent ma-
nipulation of single quanta in the motional modes.

The zeroth-order term is the carrier transition Hamil-

tonian,

resonant for δ = 0. The Rabi frequency is modiﬁed due
to the motional coupling as Ω′ = (1+η2
c )Ω. This
Hamiltonian induces qubit transitions without aﬀecting
the motional state of the ion. It may be used to prepare
the qubit quantum state in order to apply suitable control
over the motional modes.

The ﬁrst two terms are resonant for δ = −ωs and excite
the qubit while annihilating a phonon in mode ˆs, and
vice-versa; the remaining terms, resonant for δ = ωs,
promote the excitation of the qubit while creating one
additional phonon in the motional mode, and conversely.
The CZ paradigm utilizes this Hamiltonian to map the
qubit state into one motional mode or to realize con-
ditional logic between them, employing the vibrational
mode as an eﬀective two-level ancilla system.

Our interest here lies mostly in the second-order terms
of ˆHI . They entail the creation or annihilation of two
phonons at a time together with the excitation or de-
excitation of the qubit. The single-mode Hamiltonians

II. BICHROMATIC CV QUANTUM GATES

Due to its property of saturating with the absorption
of a single quantum, the qubit provides a convenient way
to add or subtract individual phonons in motional modes.
However, it also prevents the motional state from attain-
ing a fast increase in the number of excitations.

Quantum gates acting on the CV system must be al-
lowed to visit ever higher excitation numbers without
saturating, a feature that may require the qubit state to
factor out of the interaction. Hence to allow interesting
combinations of terms of ˆH (1)
ab to be simul-
taneously resonant, we consider bichromatic light sources
to drive the quantum dynamics [8, 9, 43, 44].

An alternative and more intuitive picture of CV opera-
tions in this case makes use of the phase space of position
and momentum observables, describing quantum gates in
terms of the transformations they produce in the Wigner
function of the quantum system. We employ this ap-
proach below to describe the quantum operations of the
toolbox.

The squeezing operation is realized by considering the

A. Single-mode Gaussian operations

The single-mode Gaussian operations comprise dis-

placements and squeezers.

Displacements produce a translation of the phase
space, rigidly moving the Wigner function.
If the ar-
guments of the single-mode Wigner function are xs and
ps, a displacement with parameter α = xα + ipα pro-
duces the phase space transformations xs → xs − xα and
ps → ps − pα.
Squeezers change the scaling of phase space, com-
pressing and stretching diﬀerent directions, while re-
specting the conservation of areas. A squeezer with
parameter ξ = r exp(2iθ) aﬀects the orthogonal axis
xθ = cos θxs+sin θys and pθ = − sin θxs+cos θps in phase
space according to the transformations xθ → e−rxθ and
pθ → erpθ. In the description in terms of phonons, the
most prominent characteristic of a squeezed state is the
primacy of even numbers of quanta.

Although formally implicit in the squeezing operation,
we may consider the Fourier transform operation as a dis-
tinct quantum gate. In phase space, the Fourier trans-
form gate produces a rotation.
It transforms position
and momentum according to xs → xθ and ps → pθ
deﬁned above. In the phonon picture, the Fourier gate
introduces a number-dependent phase shift in the form
|nsi → einθ|nsi, where ns is the phonon number in mode
ˆs, generating dynamics akin to the free evolution of the
oscillator.

s

In the case of the ion trap processor, a single-mode
displacement of mode ˆs is performed by the Hamiltonian
ˆH (1)
, given the conditions below. Two coherent radiation
sources with the same intensity and opposite detunings
δ1 = −δ2 = δ := ωs, according to Eq. (7), generate the
Hamiltonian

ˆH (1)
s = iΩ ˆσφ−π/2(cid:0) ˜αˆs† − ˜α∗ˆs(cid:1) ,

(10)

where ˆσφ = ˆσx cos φ + ˆσy sin φ and the relative phase be-
tween the two frequency components of light is 2φ. This
phase controls the displacement parameter per unit time,
given by ˜α = Ωei(φ− π
2 ). The realization of a single-mode
displacement operation requires the qubit quantum state
to be initialized in an eigenstate of the operator ˆσφ−π/2.
Let us adopt the convention that the qubit eigenstate
|+iφ−π/2 with positive eigenvalue is chosen. Then the
displacement ˆD(α) := exp(cid:0)αˆs† − α∗ˆs(cid:1) of mode ˆs by the
amplitude α = η2

where ˜ξ = Ωei(φ−π/2) is the squeezing parameter per unit

tor S(ξ) := exp(cid:0)ξ∗ˆs2 − ξˆs†2(cid:1), with squeezing parame-
˜ξt. The corresponding evolution operator is
t/(cid:17). Although not systematically
ˆSs = exp(cid:16)−iη2

investigated, quantum noise reduction has been observed
in the motional state of trapped ions [45, 46], revealing
the potential of the ion trap to produce large amounts of
squeezing for quantum computing.

and produces the evolution ˆF = eiθˆs† ˆs, where the rota-
tion phase is θ = η2

the state |+iφ.

B. Two-mode Gaussian operations

Gaussian operations acting on two vibrational modes
produce transformations in linear combinations of modal
operators. They can be either passive, promoting the
exchange of quanta between modes, or active, in which
case quanta are concomitantly added or removed from
both modes in a correlated way.

The passive operation is the beam splitter (named af-
ter its optical counterpart), a quantum gate that coher-
ently combines the modal operators by amounts that vary
with the interaction time. The active operation of a two-
mode squeezer produces correlated pairs of quanta, in
the phonon picture, or EPR-like entangled states in the
phase space picture [48].

Two-mode operations are realized in the ion trap by
the cross Hamiltonian H (2)
ab . A bichromatic ﬁeld may
modify Eq. (9) to produce two types of dynamics. For
the ﬁrst dynamics, we choose radiation frequencies such
that δ1 = −δ2 := δ = ωa − ωb (we assume ωa > ωb for
deﬁniteness). The resulting Hamiltonian reads as

ab = Ω ˆσφ(cid:16)e−iφˆaˆb† + eiφˆa†ˆb(cid:17) .
ˆH (2)

(13)

The beam splitter transformation is realized by the evo-
It pro-
motes the interference of modal operators in the form

lution operator ˆIab = exp(cid:16)−iηaηb ˆH (2)

ab t/(cid:17).

for t = π/(2b);

ˆa → ˆa cos(bt) + ˆb sin(bt) and ˆb → −ˆa sin(bt) + ˆb cos(bt),
where b = 2ηaηbΩ. For instance, modes interfere max-
imally at half this time,
for double
that amount of time, the quantum state of one mode
is mapped into the other, and vice-versa, coherently ex-
changing their local quantum states.
In case the two-
mode quantum state is initially separable, the beam split-
ter dynamics will entangle the modes unless the initial
state is a coherent state.

The second type of two-mode dynamics involves the
choice of detunings δ1 = −δ2 := δ = ωa + ωb. The
resonant terms of Eq. (9) produce the interaction Hamil-
tonian

ab t/(cid:17) produces

The two-mode squeezer ˆEab = exp(cid:16)i ˆH

EPR-type entangled states between the motional modes
when acting over the oscillator ground state. As in previ-
ous cases, the relative phase between the laser frequency
components controls the operation phase as long as the
qubit degree of freedom is prepared in the eigenstate
|+iφ.

C. Non-Gaussian single- and two-mode operations

Gaussian operations are restricted to produce Gaus-
sian quantum states when starting from one. To pro-
duce more general quantum states and achieve computa-
tional universality, at least one non-Gaussian operation
is needed [16, 17]. In fact, the ion trap quantum proces-
sor provides a wide variety of non-Gaussian operations,
made available by the strong non-linearity of the qubit
degree of freedom, which saturates with a sole quantum.
The number of phonons in the CV degrees of freedom
can thus be increased by discrete amounts by coupling
it with the qubit, thus producing non-Gaussian quantum
states.

The most convenient operation of single-mode phonon
creation or annihilation stems from the red- and blue-
sideband interactions produced by ˆH (1)
[Eq. (7)]. They
can be realized with a monochromatic laser beam with
frequency δ = ωs (blue sideband) or δ = −ωs (red side-
band), respectively, yielding

s

ˆHs,blue = 1

ˆHs,red = 1

Ω(cid:0)ˆσ+ˆs† + ˆσ−ˆs(cid:1) ,
Ω(cid:0)ˆσ+ˆs + ˆσ−ˆs†(cid:1) .

(15)

(16)

We denote the respective evolution operators as ˆBs =
exp(cid:16)−iηs ˆHs,bluet/(cid:17) and ˆRs = exp(cid:16)iηs ˆHs,redt/(cid:17).

Both interactions show linear coupling strength on ηs,
making them stronger in comparison with the Gaussian
operations considered previously. This property favors
the creation or annihilation of any number of phonons
in a stepwise process, by applying blue or red sidebands

5

intercalated by π-pulses in the carrier transition (δ = 0).
In this manner, the Fock state |ni can be generated.
In the case of two modes, the cross Hamiltonian ˆH (2)
ab
allows the simultaneous creation or annihilation of two
phonons, one in each mode, by also employing a laser of
single frequency.
In the ﬁrst case, a laser with detun-
ing δ = ±(ωa − ωb) will remove one phonon from one
mode and create one phonon in the other, promoting the
coherent exchange of a single excitation between modes.
To avoid entanglement between qubit and vibrational
modes, creation or annihilation of phonons must be real-
ized over suitable initial states, such as the ground state
of the oscillator. In this manner, non-Gaussian features
can be used as resources introduced at certain steps of
the computation obeying such constraint (e.g. at its be-
ginning).

Finally, a third vibrational mode can be employed as
ancilla to perform operations on the other modes. For
instance, in the case of Gaussian operations, a displace-
ment operation can be realized by writing a coherent
state with large amplitude on the ancilla mode and ap-
plying the beam splitter operation for a short duration to
coherently combine its quantum state with that of mode
ˆa or ˆb. Non-Gaussian features could also be written in
the third mode and then introduced in other modes by
the two-mode Gaussian operators mentioned previously.
Operations such as sum or subtraction of phonons could
be realized in a similar manner.

D. Two-mode conditional operations

Controlled operations involving two modes are in-
tended to change the quantum state of one mode con-
ditioned on the state of another, usually generating en-
tanglement [13]. One example of such operation is the
controlled displacement, represented by the operator

ˆCˆxa = exp(−iˆxa ⊗ ˆpb) ,

(17)
where the order of the systems is control ⊗ target. For
instance, if both modes start as independent coherent
states, this gate displaces the average momentum of the
target mode by the average position of the control mode.
Other types of controlled gates can be devised by taking
Eq. (17) as model.

In the ion trap, controlled gates can be deployed by two
bichromatic lasers, i.e. by tetrachromatic light. In fact,
by the form of Eq. (17), conditioned dynamics can be seen
to involve a combination of beam splitter and squeezing
operations. A tetrachromatic laser with frequency com-
ponents δ1 = −δ2 := ωa − ωb and δ3 = −δ4 := ωa + ωb
with the same intensity gives rise to the dynamics

tors, according to the map ˆJ+ = ˆa†ˆb and ˆJ− = ˆaˆb†, where
ˆJ± = ˆJx ± i ˆJy are the raising and lowering operators de-
ﬁned in terms of the x- and y-components of the angular
momentum vector. The corresponding z-component is
represented by the operator ˆJz = (ˆa†ˆa − ˆb†ˆb)/2. Each
eigenvalue of the angular momentum magnitude ˆJ 2 cor-
responds to a ﬁxed total number N = na + nb of phonons
available in the two modes. Eigenstates of ˆJ 2 can be rep-
resented by an angular momentum vector over a sphere.
The poles of the sphere are the eigenstates |Ni and
| − Ni of ˆJz. They correspond to the harmonic oscilla-
tor states |Nia|0ib and |0ia|Nib, respectively. The other
eigenstates of ˆJz exist as superpositions of Fock states
|nia|N − nib, where n is the diﬀerence of quanta between
modes ˆa and ˆb (equal to half the eigenvalue of ˆJz),
It might be useful sometimes to think of the two-mode
quantum operations described above as the manipulation
of such angular momentum vector, even though in most
cases the two-mode motional quantum state will not be
in a superposition of Fock states satisfying the property
na + nb = N . The Schwinger map is particularly suit-
able to treat the beam splitter operation, since it con-
serves the total number of excitations in the two modes.
In the Schwinger map, the beam splitter Hamiltonian of
Eq. (13) reads as

ˆH (2)

ab = Ω ˆσφ ˆJφ,

(19)

where ˆJφ = cos φ ˆJx + sin φ ˆJy. Hence the beam splitter
operation can be interpreted as a rotation of the angular
momentum vector existing in the sphere associated with
an eigenstate of ˆJ 2 = ˆJ 2
z . For quantum states
inhabiting more than one sphere, the beam splitter re-
alizes a coherent superposition of rotations, one in each
sphere.

ION TRAP CVQC TOOLBOX

A. Architecture

The realization of CVQC with the motional modes of
trapped ions requires the ability to select speciﬁc quan-
tum dynamics by tuning the properties of the manip-
ulation laser. As presented above, quantum gates can
be implemented with monochromatic radiation or using
a combination of frequency components commensurate
with the frequencies of vibration. They are selected by
radiation frequency (detuning) and direction of propaga-
tion (Lamb-Dicke parameter).

The quantum gates considered in Sec. II form the ba-
sic toolbox to perform the coherent manipulation of the
vibrational modes. Fig. 2 shows the Gaussian operations

FIG. 2. Toolbox of Gaussian operations available for the ma-
nipulation of the vibrational state of a single trapped ion. The
desired quantum gate is selected by radiation frequency. With
the exception of the Fourier transform operation ˆFs, all quan-
tum gates require bichromatic radiation with δ1 = −δ2 = δ.
Possible values of detuning correspond to any of the: vibra-
tional frequencies ωs (continuous lines), double those frequen-
cies (dashed lines), subtraction (dotted lines) or sum (dash-
dot lines) of pairs of frequencies. The corresponding Gaussian
operations are displacements ˆDs, squeezers ˆSs, beam split-
ters ˆIss′ , and two-mode squeezers ˆEss′ , respectively, where
s, s′ ∈ {a, b, c}. In choosing the ratio of vibrational frequen-
cies, we have adopted the proportion ωa : ωb : ωc = 7 : 5 : 4.

together with the bichromatic laser detunings required
for their realization in the case that all three vibrational
modes of a single trapped ion are employed (the label s
now reads s ∈ {a, b, c}).

The single-mode quantum gates comprise the displace-
ment ˆDs, squeezer ˆSs, Fourier transform ˆFs, blue- ˆBs,
and red-sideband ˆRs operations. Their necessary laser
frequency components and evolution operators are sum-
marized as:

δ1 = −δ2 = ωs :
δ1 = −δ2 = 2ωs :
δ = 0 :
δ = ωs :
δ = −ωs :

Two-mode operations must be applied to pairs of
modes. To account for the three combinations of mode
pairs, we introduce a second index s′ ∈ {a, b, c}. The
two-mode gates are the beam splitter ˆIss′ , the two-mode
squeezer ˆEss′ , and the general conditional operation ˆCss′ .

They require the radiation frequencies:

δ1 = −δ2 = ωs − ωs′ :

Three types of gates utilize monochromatic radia-
tion (Fourier transform ˆFs, blue-sideband ˆRs and red-
sideband ˆRs), four require bichromatic lasers (displace-
ment ˆDs, squeezer ˆSs, beam splitter ˆIss′ , and two-mode
squeezer ˆEss′ ), and one employs tetrachromatic light (the
conditional operation ˆCss′ ).

Diﬀerent operations are selected by laser detuning δ
and propagation direction (through ηs), so as to keep oﬀ-
resonant terms of the complete Hamiltonian suﬃciently
detuned in order to avoid exciting population in undesir-
able quantum states. Hence for a given pair of modes the
proposed CVQC architecture requires the frequencies ωs,
ωs′ , 2ωs, 2ωs′, ωs − ωs′ , and ωs + ωs′ to be incommensu-
rate and suﬃciently separated. For a processor based on
the three motional modes of a single trapped ion, a to-
tal of 12 incommensurate frequencies must be available.
For instance, the oscillation frequencies ωa = 7 MHz,
ωb = 5 MHz, and ωc = 4 MHz (i.e.
in the propor-
tion 7:5:4 adopted in Fig. 2) would furnish 1 MHz as
the free spectral interval between quantum gates. These
vibrational frequencies can be achieved by engineering
the trap potential through the electrodes geometry and
the magnitudes of the applied external voltages. Asym-
metric trap designs producing vibrational frequencies as
high as 50 MHz have been demonstrated [49].

Control of the Lamb-Dicke parameters ηs, although
not necessary for all quantum gates, also helps avert oﬀ-
resonant excitations. Since these parameters depend on
the direction of laser propagation, it is possible to mit-
igate undesirable excitations by employing laser beams
propagating in suitable directions. The Fourier trans-
form operation, however, requires the ability to control
the Lamb-Dicke parameters by laser direction, given that
it utilizes the qubit carrier frequency for the manipula-
tion of all modes. The Fourier transform can also be
made to act simultaneously on more than one mode by
adapting the same idea.

The CVQC ion trap architecture utilizes the qubit de-
gree of freedom as mediator for the interaction between
modes, and as such it must remain separable from the
vibrational modes once CV gates are applied. That re-
quirement is automatically fulﬁlled by all Gaussian quan-
tum gates, since in those cases the qubit remains in an
eigenstate of a Pauli operator throughout the quantum
evolution. The only cases in which the fulﬁllment of this
requirement must be veriﬁed are those involving the ap-
plication of non-Gaussian operations (i.e. blue- and red-
sidebands), for which the saturation properties of the
qubit are harnessed and thus play a role in entangling
it with the vibrational modes.

the argument, blue- and red-sideband operations induce
transitions between the basis states |g, nsi ↔ |e, ns ± 1i
with eﬀective coupling rates varying as Ωns = Ω0√n + 1,
where Ω0 = ηsΩ is the Rabi frequency for the fundamen-
tal transition |g, 0i ↔ |e, 1i, in case of the blue-sideband
operation, or |e, 0i ↔ |g, 1i for the red-sideband. For in-
stance, the creation of an additional phonon on the quan-
tum state |g, nsi would require a π pulse, corresponding
to the interaction time τns = π/Ω0√ns + 1 which de-
pends on ns. Thus a general single-mode vibrational
quantum state initially separable from the qubit state
dns|nsi would become en-
tangled with the qubit after application of any of these
non-Gaussian pulses.

and written as |ψsi = Pns

To avoid this situation, non-Gaussian operations can-
not be applied to any quantum state, but must be re-
stricted to initial states capable of satisfying the require-
ment of factorization of the qubit upon completion of the
quantum gate. The ground state is an obvious choice of
initialization. A sequence of blue-sideband pulses and
carrier pulses can then be applied to produce any Fock
state |na, nb, nci.
In truth, the class of non-Gaussian quantum states
available can be increased by employing the Schwinger
map. Considering a pair of modes, states with the form
|ns, 0s′i possess well deﬁned value of ˆJz. The beam split-
ter operation can then be applied to distribute the ns
quanta between the modes while keeping the qubit sepa-
rable. Then two-mode non-Gaussian states are also avail-
able which are built as supositions of the basis states
|ns, ns′i satisfying ns + ns′ = N ′, where N ′ is a constant.

B. Dimension of the motional Hilbert space

It is a useful exercise to estimate the potential lim-
its of CVQC with the motional modes of a trapped ion.
The number of modes would probably be limited to a
few, owing to the requirement of frequency selectivity in
the coherent manipulation. Here we estimate the limita-
tions of the most basic architecture composed of a single
trapped ion and three motional modes.

Let us ﬁrst estimate the expected performance of the
ion trap motional modes with proven technology. Typi-
cal large ion traps, with electrode distances on the or-
der of 1 mm, although not built for the purpose of
CVQC, can currently handle at least N ≈ 100 phonons
according to experiment [50]. The Hilbert space read-
ily available in the three motional modes of such traps
would have dimension D ≈ 106. The equivalent num-
ber Nqubit of ions needed to produce a Hilbert space
of the same dimension in the CZ paradigm would be
Nqubit ≈ log 106/ log 2 ≈ 20. Hence we can safely es-
timate that transitioning to the CVQC could in princi-
ple increase the Hilbert space available in the current ion
trap processor to values much larger than the best limits
demonstrated to date [51].

Considering a single motional mode for the sake of

Ultimately, the size of Hilbert space associated with

each mode is limited by anharmonicities in the trap po-
tencial, which make the energy separation between adja-
cent Fock states dependent on the number of phonons.
Since actual implementations of the harmonic potential
can only be valid in a restricted physical volume, anar-
monicities will introduce a maximum phonon number cap
N per mode. Hence for a single trapped ion the three vi-
brational modes available would entail a Hilbert space of
dimension D ≈ N 3. To estimate practical values of N ,
we may consider the typical length of a long ion chain
available with current technology (ℓ ≈ 100 µm) as pro-
viding the maximum attainable length for the wavefunc-
tion of a single trapped ion. Imposing ℓ ≈ √N + 1xs, the
phonon cap would thus be limited to N ≈ (ℓ/xs)2 ≈ 108.
The three modes would together visit a Hilbert space of
dimension N ≈ 1024. The same Hilbert space could be
accessed in the CZ paradigm by employing Nqubit ≈ 80
ionic qubits. This value represents the limitations im-
posed by the hardware on our CVQC architecture in the
simplest scenario using proven technology (i.e. wherein a
single trapped ion is utilized and the harmonic potential
is not optimized to cover a larger volume in space).

s

.

A more stringent limit would consider the onset of un-
desirable eﬀects on the CV quantum gates as they start
to show dependence on the phonon number for large N .
In fact, higher order terms can be neglected in the ex-
pansion of Eq. (5) only if η2
s N ≪ 1. We hence con-
sider N ≈ 100/(η2
s) as the reasonable phonon cap of
our architecture. For laser excitation of ﬁxed frequency,
the Lamb-Dicke parameter scales with the oscillator fre-
quency as ω−1/2
Increasing the trap stiﬀness thus al-
lows for a larger Hilbert space while decreasing the in-
teraction strength and hence the duration of quantum
gates, in this manner limiting the maximum number of
gates whithin the coherence time of the motional modes.
This latter side eﬀect could be compensated by increas-
ing the laser power as long as oﬀ-resonant excitations
can be neglected. A credible scenario considering the
balance between gate speed and trap stiﬀness would put
the Lamb-Dicke parameter at values around ηs ≈ 10−3,
allowing for the three-mode Hilbert space to achieve the
realistic dimension of D ≈ 1012. The equivalent number
of qubits would be in this case Nqubit ≈ 40. Interesting
applications in quantum simulations already exist for a
conﬁguration space of this size [22, 52–54].

As a side advantage, the vibrational modes of trapped
ions can be made to attain a large Hilbert space while
producing modest increase in the physical volume occu-
pied by the quantum system (and thus decreasing the
experimental complexity), a feature that should help pro-
tect it from environmental decoherence.

C. Measurement of the motional quantum state

It is a daunting challenge to completely characterize
the quantum state of large Hilbert spaces, a hurdle in-
herent to any architecture of a quantum computer. But it

8

is often not necessary. A good quantum algorithm must
yield as the result of computation an answer that does
not require complete quantum state reconstruction [55–
57].

In the case of the ionic vibrational modes, the infor-
mation directly available to measurement is either (i) the
populations of Fock states or (ii) values of the Wigner
function at any point in phase space. The possibility to
choose between two diﬀerent sets of quantum observables
brings an additional ﬂexibility to this physical system.
Following (i), if we write the motional quantum state in
the Fock basis of Eq. (1), then the populations |dnanbnc|2
are available to measurement; In case the phase space
picture is better suited to the kind of computation be-
ing performed, scenario (ii) puts the value of the Wigner
function at any point (xa, pa, xb, pb, xc, pc) as determined
by the parity of the phonon distribution, a quantity that
can be obtained without the need to recover the full pop-
ulation of Fock states, but by directly employing the
qubit degree of freedom [42]. Direct measurements of
the Wigner function can also be utilized to infer general
properties of the quantum state [58? ]. We develop more
on each possibility in the following.

As noted previously, in scenario (i) the Fourier trans-
form gate acting on a single mode presents phonon-
number dependent coupling in transitions of the type
|g, nsi ↔ |e, ns ± 1i. This means that driving the
qubit with a resonant laser will produce Rabi oscilla-
tion composed of diﬀerent harmonic components. The
Rabi frequency associated with the general transition
|g, na, nb, nci ↔ |e, na, nb, nci is

Ωnanbnc = Ω′ − ∆Ωnanbnc,

(22)

frequency ∆Ωnanbnc = Ω0Ps η2

showing a fast component Ω′ (employed for short times
to manipulate the qubit in the Bloch sphere during the
computational stage) and a slowly varying envelope with
s ns that contains the
phonon number dependence and thus the information on
the Fock state populations [40, 41]. While the same is
true for driving the blue- or red-sideband transitions, the
Fourier gate has the advantage of providing linear depen-
dence on ns, in contrast with the √ns dependence of the
ˆBs and ˆRs operations.

Hence by driving the carrier transition (δ = 0) and
recording the ion excitation as a function of time, one
is able to distinguish among the N 3 diﬀerent popula-
tions given that all frequencies ∆Ωnanbnc are diﬀerent,
a condition achieved by tuning the Lamb-Dicke param-
eters ηs. The actual implementation of these ideas will
require deﬁning the maximum time interval T available
for driving the qubit Rabi oscillation (limited by qubit
decoherence and phonon number population integrity)
and choosing slightly diﬀerent values for ηs while re-
s N ≪ Ω′ for the phonon
cap. For instance, one could impose ηc = ηb + δη and
ηb = ηa + δη while requiring the fastest phonon compo-
nent ∆Ω001 to be much smaller than Ω′, e.g. by the con-
ditions ∆Ω001 = Ω′/nﬂops, where nﬂops ≫ 1 is a constant,

specting the condition Ω0Ps η2

and ∆Ω100 ≈ Ω′/(nﬂops + ∆nﬂops), where the constant
∆nﬂops ∼ 1 allows one to distringuish among phonon
modes. On the other limit, the value of T ﬁxes the small-
est detectable fringe displacement, and thus the phonon
cap N , by the condition ∆ΩN N N ≈ 2π/T . In this man-
ner, the experimental context deﬁnes the possible values
of ηs and N . As a numerical example, supposing the ex-
perimental values Ω0 ≈ 2π× 10 µs and T ≈ 100 ms [59],
one obtains ηs ≈ 10−1 and N ≈ 100; The Hilbert space
would comprise 106 basis states, imprinting the need to
detect the same amount of Fourier frequencies in the en-
velope of 104 Rabi oscillations of the qubit (hence each os-
cillation should be sampled by ≈ 102 measurements). In-
creasing the maximum number of distinguishable phonon
number populations requires faster driving capability of
the carrier frequency Ω0 [60], or even larger T for the
measurement of the oscillation series [61, 62].

Scenario (ii) involves using the property of the Wigner
function whereby its value at the origin of phase space is
proportional to the average of the parity operator ˆP =
eiπ Ps ˆs† ˆs on the vibrational modes [63], i.e.

W ({0}) =

2

π Xna,nb,nc

(−1)na+nb+nc|dnanbnc|2.

(23)

In this approach, coherences can also be accessed. The
Wigner function W (xa, pa, xb, pb, xc, pc) at any other
point in phase space can be measured by displacing the
quantum state conveniently.

The Fourier gate provides the mapping of the phonon
populations into the qubit excitation [40, 41].
In the
tridimensional case, a convenient choice of Lamb-Dicke
parameters for this type of measurement is ηa = ηb =
ηc := η. The Rabi frequency of Eq. (22) can be written
in this case as

Ωnanbnc = Ω0 − (1 + n)∆Ω,

(24)

where the envelope beatnote frequency is ∆Ω = η2Ω0 and
n = na + nb + nc. Upon application of the Fourier gate,
the motional quantum state of Eq. (1) becomes entangled
with the qubit, supposed initially in the ground state,
yielding

|Ψ(t)i =

N

Xna,nb,nc=0

dnanbnc(cid:16) cos(Ωnanbnc t)|gi|na, nb, nci
+ sin(Ωnanbnct)|ei|na, nb, nci(cid:17). (25)

9

where dn = dnanbnc with the restriction na + nb + nc = n.
The parity can be obtained by tracing out the motional
modes. The ﬁnal qubit density matrix presents a sum of
the diagonal elements |dnanbnc|2 with n odd in the sector
|gihg| and vice-versa. The Wigner function at the origin
of phase space then reads as [40, 41]

W ({0}) =

2
π

(Pe − Pg) ,

(27)

where Pe = Pn |d2n|2 and Pg = Pn |d2n+1|2 are respec-
tively the populations of |ei and |gi qubit states.
In case one wishes to increase the phonon cut-oﬀ N , the
Rabi frequency associated with the phonon state readout
may become untenably high with regular pulses. There
is a variety of tools developed in by the nuclear magnetic
resonance community that can be applied to overcome
this limitation [64–72]. All these techniques rely on fre-
quency modulation to increase the pulse bandwidth ex-
citation with limited power. The DANTE experiment
consists of short pulses equally spaced in time and in-
terleaved at diﬀerent frequencies in the bandwidth to be
excited [64, 65]. Recently, a similar method had been
proposed in the context of trapped ions to readout the
motional state [28]. The main idea is to perform a Ram-
sey experiment using spin-dependent kicks (SDK), whose
propagator is ˆUSDK = ˆD(iη)ˆσ+ + ˆD(−iη)ˆσ− and where
ˆD is the displacement operator of a single mode. These
SDK’s are concatenated to generate a larger eﬀective
SDK, ˆU N ′
SDK, where N ′ is the number of SDK’s. In princi-
ple, such method should be able to sense motional states
up to ¯N ≈ 109 [28].
Also of particular interest are the so called ‘adiabatic
pulses’ [69, 70], extensively employed in magnetic res-
onance imaging. These pulses can have any frequency
and/or amplitude modulation as long as a simple adia-
batic condition is fulﬁlled which relates pulse strength
to how fast its frequency modulation occurs. When
properly designed, the main advantages of the adiabatic
pulses are: (i) the excited bandwidth depends only on the
frequency sweep during the pulse and (ii) their insensi-
tivity to inhomogeneities in the strength of the pulses and
oﬀ-resonance eﬀects for a given pulse power [69, 71, 72].
An special type of adiabatic pulse is the so-called ‘rapid
adiabatic passage’ pulse, which was employed in trapped
ions to measure the motional ground state [73], to con-
trol the motional states using sideband excitation [74],
and to prepare Dicke states [75, 76].

Choosing the gate application time t = t0 so that
| cos(∆Ωt)| = 1 for odd n and null otherwise, and com-
mensurate frequencies such that Ω0/∆Ω = 4m (m inte-
ger), we ﬁnd

|Ψ(t0)i = Xn (cid:16)d2n+1(−1)2n+1|gi|na, nb, nci
+ d2n(−1)2n|ei|na, nb, nci(cid:17),

(26)

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

After many years of intense progress in experiments,
one of the most pressing challenges of quantum compu-
tation nowadays is the enlargement of the Hilbert space
available. In the CZ paradigm of ion trap quantum com-
puting, extending the Hilbert space requires adding ever
more ions to the quantum processor. As the number of
ions increases, so does the inﬂuence of the environment

10

in the form of natural decay and stray magnetic ﬁelds,
the most relevant sources of environmentally driven de-
coherence in this kind of system. It may be said that, for
general experimental realizations of a quantum proces-
sor, the desired enlargement of the Hilbert space implies
as penalty greatly enlarging the physical size of the quan-
tum processor, and thus the volume of actual space, i.e.
the ‘size’ of the environment, probed by the quantum
system.

In this paper, we have tried to pursue a diﬀerent route
to enlarge the quantum conﬁguration space, by using the
volume in actual physical space sparingly: a more fea-
sible quantum computer might be that which packs a
large conﬁguration space in a small physical volume. We
have here followed an alternative route that could help
mitigate the scalability problem of the ion trap quantum
processor up to a certain point. The motional degrees of
freedom of a single trapped ion oﬀer in principle a conﬁg-
uration space with dimensionality restricted only by non-
linearities of the trap harmonic potential. This approach
has the practical advantage of causing only modest in-
crease (polynomial) of the physical volume occupied by
the atomic wave function employed in the computation.

The main advantage of the ion trap CVQC approach

is the ability to harness sectors of the computational con-
ﬁguration space which are mostly disregarded in the CZ
paradigm. The CVQC approach would in principle allow
for a substantial increase in the size of the Hilbert space
available for quantum computing while using current ion
trap technology. The increase in manipulation and mea-
surement complexity implied by our scheme would not
be particular to it, but rather a common trait to any
actual implementation of quantum computing. The fact
that our scheme seem to put those challenges within the
grasp of current technology, and hence bring them to
our minds as urgent matters, should be seen not only as
a positive trait of our proposal, but also as a reminder
of the daunting endeavor entailed in building a working
quantum computer.
