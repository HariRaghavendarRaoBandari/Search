ABSTRACT
We present an analysis of a sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies observed with Suzaku. The
aim of this work is to examine critically the evidence for a relativistic Fe Kα line in the
X-ray spectra of these AGN. The sample was compiled from those sources in which
a relativistic component was missing in at least one XMM-Newton observation. We
analysed the Suzaku spectra of these objects in order to have more constraints on the
high energy emission, including the Compton reﬂection hump. The results show that
the relativistic Fe Kα line is detected (at > 95% conﬁdence) in all sources observed
with high signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. where the counts in the 5-7 keV energy band are
& 4 × 104). This is in agreement with the idea that relativistic lines are a ubiquitous
feature in the spectra of Seyfert galaxies, but are often diﬃcult to detect without
very high quality data. We also investigate the relation between the Fe Kα line and
the reﬂection continuum at high energies. For most of the sample, the strength of
the reﬂection component is consistent with that of the line. There are exceptions in
both senses, however i.e. where the reﬂection continuum is strong but with weak line
emission, and vice versa. These observations present a challenge for standard reﬂection
models.

INTRODUCTION

According to standard models, the X-ray emission of Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) originates in the innermost regions of
the accretion ﬂow, via inverse Compton scattering of the disc
thermal photons in a hot, optically thin plasma (the so called
corona) located above the accretion disc (e.g., Shapiro et al.
1976; Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980; Haardt & Matt 1993;
Haardt & Maraschi 1993; Haardt et al. 1994).

This primary X-ray emission interacts with the optically
thick matter of the accretion disc and the molecular torus,
producing a reﬂection spectrum (George & Fabian 1991).
This spectrum is characterised by a series of ﬂuorescence
lines, the most prominent, due to a combination of ﬂuores-
cence yield and cosmic abundance, is the Fe Kα line at 6.4
keV (e.g., Matt et al. 1997; Nandra & Pounds 1994). The re-
ﬂection spectrum extends also to the hard X-ray band, where
emission is produced as a consequence of Compton-back
scattering of the high energy photons (e.g., Pounds et al.
1990; George & Fabian 1991) from the primary continuum.
This reﬂection continuum typically peaks at ∼20-30 keV
producing a prominent broad feature, known as the Comp-
ton hump. When the reﬂection arises from the inner regions

⋆ E-mail: gmantova@mpe.mpg.de

of the accretion disc, it will be aﬀected by the strong gravita-
tional ﬁeld of the black hole. The result is an Fe Kα emission
line whose shape is modiﬁed into a skewed and asymmetric
proﬁle (Fabian et al. 1989, 2002, 2009, Tanaka et al. 1995).
Since the relativistic lines originate within few gravitational
radii from the central object, the analysis of these features
represents a powerful probe of the innermost region of the
AGN.

(i.e.
the
Yaqoob & Padmanabhan
2007;
de La Calle P´erez et al. 2010; Patrick et al. 2012) has
revealed the presence of a ubiquitous narrow component
in the spectra of the brightest AGN observed with XMM-
Newton and SUZAKU. Assuming a standard accretion
disc, expected in high eﬃciency systems such as bright
Seyfert galaxies, broad Fe Kα lines should also be detected
in the X-ray spectra. However,
in samples of objects,
where XMM-Newton and SUZAKU observations were
analysed, some sources and/or observations were missing
this component (30% of the sources in Nandra et al. 2007,
60% in de La Calle P´erez et al. 2010, 50% in Patrick et al.
2012 and 20% in Walton et al. 2013). The reason why this
component is not detected in some cases is still unclear.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
puzzle. Looking at the samples compiled with XMM-

2 G. Mantovani, K. Nandra, G. Ponti

Newton observations, the overall picture shows that low
signal-to-noise ratio could be one of the main reasons
for the absence of a detection of the relativistic line in
some observations or sources (e.g., Guainazzi et al. 2006,
Nandra et al. 2007, de La Calle P´erez et al. 2010). Another
possible explanation is that in some sources the disk is
truncated, so that the inner radius is large and the relativis-
tic eﬀects relatively small. Bhayani & Nandra (2011) have
on the other hand suggested that strong relativistic eﬀects,
disk ionization and/or high disk inclination can explain the
apparent lack of relativistic signatures, due to the diﬃculty
of disentangling very broad features from the continuum.

The aim of this work is to investigate this phenomenon
by analyzing SUZAKU observations of sources previously
observed with XMM-Newton, where a relativistic Fe Kα line
is missing. The high throughput of SUZAKU around the Fe
Kα line allows an independent check of the XMM-Newton
results, while the wide energy range allows an investigation
of the Compton hump at high energies, for comparison with
the emission line properties.

2 SAMPLE

The objects for our analysis were chosen from the work of
Nandra et al. (2007). They compiled their sample from the
observations available in the XMM-Newton public archive,
cross-correlated with the V´eron-Cetty & V´eron (2001) AGN
catalogue. The analysis was restricted to nearby objects,
with a cutoﬀ on the redshift of z < 0.05. Seyfert 2 galaxies
were excluded, as were radio loud objects and central clus-
ter galaxies (see Nandra et al. (2007) for more details). From
these objects we selected those in which a relativistic Fe Kα
line was not detected. If a source has multiple observations
and one of these did not show a relativistic component, the
object was still included in our analysis. The sources satisfy-
ing these criteria and observed by SUZAKU are reported in
Table 1. The SUZAKU data give better constraints at the
high energies (> 10keV) and hence better modelling of the
primary continuum and the Compton hump. Two sources,
Mrk 6 and HE 1143-1810, were excluded in the following
analysis because no SUZAKU observations are available. In
Table 1 we report the continuum ﬂux in the Fe K band (5-7
keV) of each source. When multiple observations are avail-
able, the mean ﬂux is quoted. We also report the number of
observations analysed and the total exposure time in ks.

A special case is that of NGC 2110. This is a narrow-line
object in the optical and is viewed through a relatively large
absorption screen, which may be patchy (e.g., Evans et al.
2007), or ionized (Nandra et al. 2007). Diﬀerent observa-
tions with XMM-Newton, Chandra and SUZAKU demon-
strated the presence of a relatively stable, full-covering ab-
sorber (column density of ∼ 3 × 1022 cm−2). Together with
this, an additional absorber, likely variable in both column
density and covering fraction, was required (Rivers et al.
2014). The diﬃculties in modelling the absorber could pro-
duce residuals in the Fe band, which are diﬃcult to disen-
tangle from any relativistic Fe Kα line. As the latter is the
main focus of our current work, we chose to exclude this
source from the following spectral analysis.

Suzaku which are missing a relativistic Fe Kα line in the XMM-

3 DATA REDUCTION

SUZAKU X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS; Koyama et al.
2007) and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD; Kokubun et al.
2007; Takahashi et al. 2007) event ﬁles for each observation
were processed adopting the standard ﬁltering criteria. We
used the calibration ﬁles from the 2013-01-10 release and
the FTOOLS package of lheasoft version 6.131 (Blackburn
1995).

3.1 X-ray Imaging Spectrometer

Source spectra were extracted from the XIS cleaned events
ﬁles adopting circular regions of 250 arcsec, centered on the
source. The background regions were made as large as pos-
sible avoiding the source, the calibration regions at the chip
corners, and any obvious non-nuclear emission. Response
matrices and ancillary response ﬁles were produced with
xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen. Data from the XIS0 and XIS3
detectors were used, and the spectra were added together.
Finally, the spectra were rebinned in order to have at least
100 counts per bin. We did not include the back-illuminated
XIS1 spectra because of the lower eﬀective area at 6 keV
and higher background level at high energies compared to
the front illuminated detectors XIS0 and XIS3.

3.2 Hard X-ray Detector

The PIN data were reduced following the standard pro-
cedure, as presented in the SUZAKU ABC guide2. The
spectra were corrected for dead time and the exposure of
the background spectra was increased by a factor of 10, as
required. The sum of the ”tuned” non X-ray background
(NXB) spectra and simulations of the Cosmic X-ray Back-
ground (CXB) was adopted as PIN background in the spec-
tral analysis. The CXB is simulated from a typical model
provided by the SUZAKU team (Boldt 1987). It is known
that the detected spectrum can be diﬀerent from that model,

due to spatial ﬂuctuations of the intrinsic CXB. These ﬂuc-
tuations are known to be of 10% from on scales of 1 sq
degree (Barcons et al. 2000). In those cases where the PIN
background has important uncertainties and the source ﬂux
is relatively low, the reliability of the PIN data can be af-
fected. Since the CXB corresponds only to 5% of the total
background spectrum (Fukazawa et al. 2009), the ﬂuctua-
tions in the total PIN background are dominated by the
uncertainties of the NXB, which are measured to be of or-
der 3%. Considering all these issues, we decided to use PIN
spectrum only in cases where the source spectrum is more
than the 20% of the background, to avoid being dominate
by background uncertainties (see Table 2).

After this analysis, the PIN spectra were rebinned to
have at least 40 counts per bin after background subtraction.

4 DATA ANALYSIS

For the spectral analysis, the xspec program (version 12.8.0)
was used. All quoted errors correspond to the 90% conﬁ-
dence level for one interesting parameter (∆χ2 = 2.71), un-
less otherwise stated. The XIS and PIN spectra were ﬁt-
ted together. To minimise the eﬀects of absorption on the
spectral ﬁts, the XIS spectra were analysed in the 3-10 keV
band, while the PIN spectra were considered in the range
presented in Table 2. We introduced a cross-normalisation
constant for both instruments, ﬁxing this to 0.994 the value
for XIS0 and XIS3, and to 1.164 for the PIN, as appropriate
for data taken at XIS nominal position (Maeda et al. 2008).

In general we ﬁtted the spectra systematically with the
same models. In a ﬁrst attempt to model the contin-
uum spectrum, we applied a model consisting of a power
law with a high energy cutoﬀ, along with neutral reﬂec-
tion (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995) and a neutral absorber
at the redshift of the source. Speciﬁcally, we used the
zwabs*(pexrav) model (Baseline model). The neutral ab-
sorber is required only in the cases of IC 4329A and
NGC 5506, with column densities of NH = 0.4 × 1022
cm−2 (Mantovani et al. 2014) and NH ∼ 3 × 1022 cm−2
(Bianchi et al. 2003), respectively. For the reﬂection, we
adopted solar abundance and we assumed an inclination of
60◦. In most cases, the high energy cutoﬀ of the intrinsic
primary continuum was ﬁxed to 300 keV. In the case of IC
4329A, we adopted Ec = 180 keV, in accordance with NuS-
TAR and SUZAKU observations (Brenneman et al. 2014,
Mantovani et al. 2014). For NGC 5506 we ﬁxed this param-
eter to Ec = 130 keV, as reported in previous BeppoSAX
observations (Bianchi et al. 2003).

In Figure 1, the data to model ratios are presented for
each source. The upper panels show the ratios when only
the continuum is ﬁtted (which we refer to as the Baseline
model). The energy range between 5 and 7 keV was excluded
in the ﬁtting process.

4.2 Narrow Line Model

After modelling the primary continuum and the Compton
reﬂection component, there is clear evidence for Fe line emis-
sion around 6.4 keV in all sources (see top panels ofFig. 1). A
narrow Fe component is predicted from any distant material
such as a molecular torus, and is commonly observed. To ver-
ify this, we added to the Baseline model a narrow gaussian
(zgauss) in order to ﬁt the main residual at ∼6.4 keV (Nar-
row Line model: zwabs*(pexrav+zgauss)), ﬁxing the width
to σ = 1 eV, while the energy was free to vary. We also
included the associated Fe Kβ line. The energy of this was
ﬁxed to 7.06 keV, the width to σ = 1 eV and the ﬂux was
linked to be 11.3 per cent of that of the Fe Kα emission line.
After the inclusion of the narrow Fe Kβ line, we tested
for the presence of narrow, ionized emission lines in all the
spectra, such as the H-like and He-like lines (Fe xxv and
Fe xxvi). For this reason, we added to the previous model
two narrow gaussian components. The rest frame energies
of these lines were ﬁxed to 6.7 keV and 6.96 keV, respec-
tively, and the widths to σ = 1 eV. In Table 3, we present
the results of this test for each observation. Together with
the ﬂuxes of the lines, we show the improvements in ∆χ2
when those components are included in the model. We con-
servatively included these lines in the subsequent analysis
whenever the 90% lower limit on the ﬂux was found to be
greater than zero. We inferred the presence of both Fe xxv
and Fe xxvi lines in all three spectra of NGC 5506, consis-
tent with previous results based on the analysis of XMM-
Newton observations (Matt et al. 2001). In the case of IC
4329A, the Fe xxv emission line was already signiﬁcantly de-
tected in the previous work of Mantovani et al. (2014), when
the same Suzaku observations were analyzed. The residuals
from these ﬁts (Narrow Line Model) are shown in the middle
panels of Figure 1.

Table 4 reports the best ﬁt parameters for each source
and observation. The primary Fe Kα narrow component is
detected in all observations, with equivalent widths ranging
from ∼40 to ∼200 eV. The energy of this component are
consistent with the line being produced by neutral mate-
rial, so the energy of the narrow Gaussian was ﬁxed to 6.4
keV in the subsequent analysis. The slopes of the power law
component, reproducing the primary continuum, also vary
within the sources of the sample, but the measurements are
consistent with values typically observed in Seyfert galaxies
(Piconcelli et al. 2005, Bianchi et al. 2009).

4.3 Relativistic FeKα analysis

We next investigated if a relativistic Fe Kα line improves the
quality of the ﬁts presented in Table 4. Ideally one would
compare the χ2 of the ﬁt with and without the broad line
component and estimate its signiﬁcance. However, assessing
the signiﬁcance of relativistic emission lines in the X-ray
spectra of AGN is not straightforward. For example, it has
been pointed out that the F-test is not a precise tool to
estimate the chance probability of detecting these or similar
features (Protassov et al. 2002).

4.3.1 Estimating the signiﬁcance of broad Fe line

detections for a given ∆χ2

In order to estimate the appropriate signiﬁcance of the line
given a ∆χ2 value, we performed Monte Carlo simulations.
We started by simulating six thousand spectra. The model

component with narrow Fe Kα, Fe Kβ and Ni Kα emission
lines and an Fe Compton shoulder: cutoﬀpl+pexmon. We
used the xspec fakeit command with the addition of the ap-
propriate noise. We took into account the response ﬁles of
the XIS instrument (i.e. XIS FI.rmf and XRT FI xisnom.arf
ﬁles). Once the spectra were simulated, we ﬁrst reﬁtted them
with the cutoﬀpl+pexmon model used to simulate them, and
then we added a relline component (Dauser et al. 2010). For
each simulated spectrum, we recorded the best ﬁts χ2 for the
two diﬀerent models. By recording how many times a ∆χ2
better than the observed values happened by chance, we can
establish a relation between the observed ∆χ2 and the sig-
niﬁcance of the detection of therelline component in the real
data.

We repeated this process using diﬀerent relativistic line
proﬁles in order to test if the threshold value of ∆χ2depends
on the parameters adopted in the relline model. Since it
is diﬃcult to constrain the most important parameters of
the relativistic line, especially in the cases where the line is
weak and/or very broad, we ﬁxed the following parameters
of the relline model: i) ERelline = 6.4 keV; ii) index1 =
index2 = 3; iii) Rbreak = 15 rg; iv) Rout = 400 rg; v) limb
= 0. Since the sources of the sample are nearby objects, we
assumed z = 0. This allows us to obtain simulations that
are useful for sources at low redshift. To correspond to the
ﬁts to the actual data (see below), we ﬁtted the line proﬁle
using diﬀerent ﬁxed inclinations (30◦, 60◦, 80◦) and inner
radii (6 rg and 1.24 rg). When the inner radius was 6 rg we
used a spin parameter a=0, appropriate for a Schwarzschild
black hole. When it was ﬁxed to 1.24 rg, the spin parameter
was changed to a = 0.998 corresponding to a maximally
spinning Kerr black hole. Table 5 presents the results of
the simulations. The ∆χ2 values reported correspond to the
95% conﬁdence level for each combination of inclination and
inner radius.

4.3.2 Spectral Analysis

Having determined the critical ∆χ2 values, we then ﬁtted
all the actual source spectra using the Relativistic Relline
model (RR): zwabs*(pexrav+zgauss+relline) with the same
relline parameters listed above, and the same combinations
of inner radius and inclination. These ﬁxed combinations are
necessary because it is very diﬃcult to constrain all param-
eters of the relativistic line simultaneously, bearing in mind
that the spectra in our sample have been chosen speciﬁcally
because the relativistic component is weak and/or of low
signiﬁcance. The Relativistic Relline model includes a neu-

tral absorber at the redshift of the source (zwabs), a cutoﬀ
power law together with a reﬂection continuum (pexrav ), a
narrow emission line (zgauss) and a relativistic line compo-
nent (relline). The width of the narrow gaussian was ﬁxed
to σ = 1 eV, and the energy to 6.4 keV. We also included
the corresponding narrow Fe Kβ. Fe xxv and Fe xxvi emis-
sion lines were included when signiﬁcantly detected in the
prior analysis (see Table 3). For each source, we ﬁtted all
the combinations of inclinations and inner radii. Thereafter,
we selected all the solutions which lead to an improvement
in χ2 at more than 95% (see Table 5 for the ∆χ2 values
adopted). If more than one solution satisﬁes this criterion,
we choose the one with the highest ∆χ2. In cases where the
line is not detected, we have chosen the combination which
leads to the best ﬁt with the highest ∆χ2 in order to calcu-
late the upper limits for the relativistic Fe line ﬂuxes. The
best ﬁt parameters for the Relativistic Relline model are pre-
sented in Table 6. The errors correspond to 1σ conﬁdence
level, whereas upper limits correspond to the 95% conﬁdence
level as determined from the simulations. The relativistic Fe
Kα emission line is detected at least in one observation of
every source in our sample, and in a total of 12 out of 22
observations. In cases where the signiﬁcance exceeds 95%
conﬁdence, we determine the signiﬁcance more precisely us-
ing the distributions of ∆χ2 from the simulations described
above. We report these values in the last column of Table
6. We also present the improvements in ∆χ2/d.o.f. when
the relline model is included in the Narrow Line model. The
mean value for the equivalent width of this component av-
eraged over all the sample is ∼ 100 eV.

in several cases in the middle panels (Narrow Line model)

However, in the case of NGC 7469 residuals around 6.4 keV
are still present even if a relativistic Fe line is included (and
detected at more than 95% conﬁdence). This could be due
to the fact that we have used ﬁxed parameters in the ﬁts.
We tested this by letting the inner radius, the inclination

and the emissivity index free to vary in the relline model
component for this source. We found a much better ﬁt in
this case with a χ2/d.o.f. = 601.13/665, compared to that
with frozen parameters (χ2/d.o.f. = 637.81/667). The best
ﬁt parameters for inclination, inner radius and emissivity
index are: θ = 17+2
−0.69. The
equivalent width of the relativistic line is EW = 81+27
−24 eV.
Our results for this source are in agreement within the errors
with previous analysis of the same spectrum performed by
Patrick et al. (2012). Figure 2 shows the data to model ra-
tios for NGC 7469 when the Baseline model (upper panel),
the Narrow Line Model (middle panel) and the Relativistic
Relline model (bottom panel) are applied to the data. It is
clear that, when the inclination, inner radius and emissiv-
ity index are free to vary in the ﬁt, the Relativistic Relline
model is ﬁtting all the residuals associated with the broad
Fe component.

Fig. 3 shows the equivalent width of the relativistic Fe
Kα line for each observations as a function of the counts
in the Fe K band. The latter values were calculated as the
product between the counts/s in the 5-7 keV energy band
and the exposure time of the observation. Diﬀerent symbols
and colours in the plot correspond to diﬀerent sources as
described in the legend. It is clear from the ﬁgure that when
the observations have a low number of counts the measure-
ment of the equivalent width of the relativistic line in general
gives only an upper limit. In contrast, whenever the counts
in the Fe band are higher than ∼ 4 × 104, we generally
see evidence for the presence of a broad Fe Kα line. Never-
theless, we do detect a relativistic Fe line in spectrum with
fewer counts (∼ 3 × 103). In Mrk 590, the inferred equivalent
width of the line (∼ 450 eV) is much larger than is typical,
accounting for the detection. In 6 out of 7 observations of
NGC 5548, we measured only an upper limit to the ﬂux
of the relativistic Fe line. In one observation, however, we

ﬁnd an apparently intense broad line with EW∼ 500 ± 250
eV, albeit at low signiﬁcance. It seems likely that this is
due to Malmquist bias, whereby we see a positive statisti-
cal ﬂuctuation in the line strength resulting in an appar-
ent detection of a strong line, when the true EW is much
lower. We further note that at some epochs exhibits absorp-
tion feature in the Fe K-band, which may complicated the
detection of the broad Fe K emission (e.g. Liu et al. 2010,
Kaastra et al. 2014). We note that while the trend of posi-
tive detections at high signal-to-noise ratio is clear, there are
also spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio where only upper
limits are obtained, most notably for IC4329A, where one
such upper limit is inconsistent with the detections in the
same source. This is discussed further in section 5.1. The re-
sults on this source are consistent with the previous work of
Mantovani et al. (2014) where the same Suzaku observations
were analyzed. The authors pointed out that the relativistic
line in this object is relatively weak and detected with high
signiﬁcance only when the data are combined together.

The main result of our analysis i.e. the need for high
signal-to-noise ratio in the detection of broad lines, is in
agreement with previous work using samples of sources
observed with XMM-Newton
(e.g., Guainazzi et al.
2006, Nandra et al.
2011,
de La Calle P´erez et al. 2010).

5 A SELF-CONSISTENT REFLECTION

MODEL

The Relativistic Relline model described above provides an
improvement to the ﬁt in many cases, but the model is not
self-consistent. This is because, as the disk is expected to be
optically thick, the relativistic line should be accompanied
by a reﬂection continuum which is also modiﬁed by the same
relativistic eﬀects as the line. Furthermore, the strength of

counts are calculated for each observation as the product of the ﬂux in the 5-7 keV energy band and the exposure time.

the continuum should be linked to the line. This latter con-
sideration also applies to the reﬂection continuum associated
with the narrow emission line, which was ﬁtted separately
from the line in our Baseline model.

To provide a more physical and self-consistent model
for the spectra, we used the pexmon model (Nandra et al.
2007). This model reproduces the main features of the re-
ﬂection spectrum produced by the interaction of the primary
continuum with a Compton thick layer of neutral material
(accretion disk and/or torus). This model combines: i) a nar-
row Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV; ii) a narrow Fe Kβ line at 7.06
keV; iii) a narrow Ni Kα line at 7.47 keV; iv) Compton re-
ﬂection and v) an Fe Kα Compton shoulder. We adopt two
such components, one from distant material (e.g. the torus)
and another modiﬁed by relativistic eﬀects in the accretion
disk. We designate this the Relativistic Pexmon model (RP)
zwabs*(cutoﬀpl+pexmon+relconv*pexmon). This model self
consistently reproduces the high energy reﬂection continua
associated with both the narrow and relativistic lines. To
model the relativistic eﬀects, one pexmon component is con-
volved with the relconv model (Dauser et al. 2010), which
broadens the whole reﬂection spectrum using the same ker-
nel as the relline emission line model (Dauser et al. 2010).
As in the Relativistic Relline model, the zwabs model was
introduced only for IC 4329A and NGC 5506 with column
densities of NH = 0.4 × 1022 cm−2 and NH = 3 × 1022
cm−2, respectively. We also ﬁxed the high energy cut-oﬀ for
these two sources to 180 keV and 130 keV, while for the
other sources in the sample we adopted 300 keV. The Fe
abundance was always ﬁxed to the solar value, and in the
relconv model we ﬁxed the following parameters, as for the
relline model: i) index1 = index2 = 3; ii) Rbreak = 15 rg; iii)
Rout = 400 rg; iv) limb = 0. For each source, we adopted the

combination of inclination and inner radius as in the Rela-
tivistic Relline model (see Table 6). The spin parameter was
assumed to be a = 0 for rin = 6 rg and a = 0.998 for rin =
1.24 rg.

RP -χ2

Table 7 presents the χ2/d.o.f. for the Relativistic Relline
and for the Relativistic Pexmon model. We also report the
∆χ2 per ∆d.o.f. between these two, expressed as χ2
RR.
This is helpful to understand whether the Fe emission line
strength and the Compton hump at higher energies are si-
multaneously well-ﬁtted, since the pexmon model links these
two quantities while the rellline model does not. We ﬁnd in
general that the physically self-consistent model provides
a similar ﬁt to the phenomenological one, showing consis-
tency between the strength of the Fe Kα line and the re-
ﬂection continuum at high energies (e.g. Compton hump).
However, in two cases (MCG +8-11-11 and IC 4329A Obs.
ID 702113020) the ∆χ2 between the Relativistic Pexmon
and the Relativistic Relline models is large (∆χ2 > 50),
indicating a much better ﬁt if the line and continuum are
decoupled. We now consider these cases in more detail.

5.1 The cases of MCG +8-11-11 and IC 4329A

We investigate here the two extreme cases where the Rel-
ativistic Relline model gives better ﬁt to the data, with a
∆χ2 > 50, compared to the more self-consistent Relativistic
Pexmon model: MCG +8-11-11 and one observation of IC
4329A (ID: 702113020).

The case of MCG +8-11-11 has already been noted by
Bianchi et al. (2010). They found a detection of relativis-
tic Fe Kα line, but without any reﬂection component at
higher energies. The results of our analysis are fully consis-
tent with this result (see Table 6). When the Relativistic

Pexmon model is applied to the data, it leads to an inad-
equate ﬁt with ∆χ = 122.74 compared to the Relativistic
Relline model. The reason is that, in the former, the Comp-
ton hump is linked to the strength of the emission line, while
in the latter they are independent. This can be discerned
immediately from the parameters in Table 6. The reﬂection
fraction R for MCG +8-11-11 is very small and well con-
strained R = 0.12+0.06
−0.05. Conversely both the narrow and rel-
ativistic lines are well detected and have a combined equiv-
alent width of 156 eV, corresponding to a total reﬂection
fraction of R ∼ 1.

Figure 4 shows the unfolded spectrum for this source
together with all the components of the Relativistic Pex-
mon model. The plot shows the best ﬁt model of the XIS
spectrum extrapolated to the high energy band, and com-
pared to the PIN data. The bottom panel shows the data to
model ratio for both the XIS and PIN spectra. It is evident
that the pexmon model greatly overestimates the amount of
reﬂection at high energies.

Physically, there are several possible interpretations for
the appearance of the spectrum of MCG +8-11-11. The ﬁrst
is that the line emission arises from material of small opti-
cal depth, producing a line but with little Compton scatter-
ing, and hence Compton hump. This interpretation is very
unlikely: the line emission in this source is strong and low
optical depth material would likely underproduce the emis-
sion line unless other circumstances were in play. A second
possibility is that the material has very high Fe abundance.

This could produce line emission which is relatively strong
compared to the Compton hump. We tested for this possi-
bility by allowing the Fe abundance to be a free parameter
in the two pexmon models. Letting this parameter free to
vary, the ﬁt does improve (χ2/d.o.f. = 1238.17/1323). How-
ever, the values of the Fe abundance for the two components
of the pexmon model are very extreme (AF e/ASolar ∼99).
This explanation therefore also seems quite unlikely. While
the Fe abundance can explain an anomalous ratio of the
line to the continuum, it does not explain why the absolute
value of the reﬂection fraction as measured by the Compton
hump is so low in this source. The most likely explanation
for the phenomenology of MCG +8-11-11 is related to our
assumptions about the high energy cutoﬀ. In our ﬁt we have
assumed an exponential cutoﬀ of 300 keV. This ensures that
there are plentiful high energy photons which can be down-
scattered into the Compton hump. If the temperature of the
corona is lower, this will suppress the high energy reﬂection
while having little eﬀect on the strength of the Fe Kα line.
We tested this by ﬁtting the spectrum imposing an high en-
ergy cutoﬀ of Ec = 50 keV in both the Relativistic Relline
and the Relativistic Pexmon models. The χ2/d.o.f. now are
comparable (Relativistic Relline: χ2/d.o.f. = 1262.03/1324;
Relativistic Pexmon: χ2/d.o.f. = 1262.31/1325).

Finally we tested the hypothesis of ionized reﬂection in
this source. We ﬁtted the spectrum with the relxill model
(Garc´ıa et al. 2014) together with a narrow pexmon compo-
nent. The relxill model allows us to ﬁt the reﬂection spec-

the accretion disk, modiﬁed by relativistic eﬀects. The best
ﬁt χ2/d.o.f. for this model is 1254.91/1322, which is compa-
rable to that obtained with the Relativistic Relline model.
The model ﬁt constraints the inclination, the reﬂection frac-
tion from the disk and the high energy cut-oﬀ of the primary
continuum: θ = 38+4
−11 keV.
Ionization of the disk is thus also a plausible explanation
for the unusual spectrum, although the rather low reﬂection
fraction is puzzling.

Intriguingly, the case of IC 4329A Obs. 702113020 ap-
pears to be opposite to that of MCG +8-11-11. In this ob-
servation, a relativistic Fe Kα line is not detected. How-

ever, a signiﬁcant contribution of the reﬂection continuum
at high energies is present, and it is well constrained (see
Table 6). This is a particularly puzzling case, because the
relativistic Fe Kα feature, while relatively week, is detected
in all the other SUZAKU spectra of this object (see also
Mantovani et al. 2014). Figure 5 shows the unfolded spec-
trum for this observation when the Relativistic Pexmon
model is applied only to the XIS spectrum and extrapolated
to high energies, and compared to the PIN data.

−015 ; Relativistic Pexmon: 0.25+0.09

Formally a sub-solar Fe abundance can account for the
weak Fe Kα line in this individual observation. We let the
Fe abundance vary in both the Relativistic Relline and Rel-
ativistic Pexmon models. The best-ﬁt Fe abundance for
the two models indeed appear to be sub-solar (Relativis-
tic Relline: 0.46+0.21
−0.08). The
diﬀerence in the goodness of ﬁt between the two also reduces
substantially, with ∆χ2 = 10.67, much less then the the ∆χ2
= 55.61 obtained with solar abundances. However, the other
observations of IC 4329A have Fe abundance close to solar. A
variation of the Fe abundances is highly unlikely, especially
if we consider the short time scale between each observa-
tion (∼ 1 week). These observations of IC 4329A therefore
provide a challenge to the prevailing reﬂection paradigm.

6 DISCUSSION

We have analysed a sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies observed
with Suzaku, which had previously shown an absence of ev-
idence for a relativistic Fe Kα emission line in their XMM-
Newton spectra. The goals of this work were to investigate
whether the Suzaku spectra show evidence for the relativis-
tic line, and whether the line, if present, is consistent with
the measured strength of the Compton hump. To achieve
these aims, we systematically ﬁtted the spectra of all the
sources with a series of models of varying complexity, test-
ing for the presence of relativistic lines and their consistency
with the Compton reﬂection hump at higher energies.

As in previous work, we ﬁnd that all the spectra show
a peak at 6.4 keV which we identify with a narrow line from
relatively distant material. The majority of the sources show
additional complexity around the Fe K-complex, however.
Several sources also show evidence for more highly ionized
species, identiﬁed with Fe xxv and Fe xxvi. In addition, at
least one observation of all the sources in our sample, and
12 out of 22 in total, shows a signiﬁcant improvement when
a relativistic line is added to the model. Where broad lines
are detect in our sample, the typical equivalent widths are in
the range 50-100 eV, and the upper limits in the case of non-
detections rarely exclude such values. This is fully consistent
with the work of Nandra et al. (2007), using XMM-Newton
data, who found an average broad line EW of ∼ 80 eV.
Both are consistent with the work of Patrick et al. (2012)
where a sample of Seyfert 1 AGN was analyzed using Suzaku
observations. In this case, the mean EW within the sample
was found to be 96+10
−10 eV. It is interesting to note that the
sources in our sample were chosen because the relativistic
line in the previous XMM-Newton spectra is weak and/or
of low signiﬁcance, but our results show that in reality they
are entirely consistent with typical line strength seen in more
complete samples.

The results for the individual sources in our sample are

also broadly consistent with previous work. XMM-Newton
observations of NGC 5506 revealed the presence of a broad
residual in the Fe band (Matt et al. 2001). The overall emis-
sion complex was equally well ﬁt either with a broad line or a
blend of He-like and H-like narrow lines. Our analysis of this
source shows that, even accounting for the presence of the
ionised emission lines, a relativistic Fe Kα emission compo-
nent with an equivalent width of ∼82 eV is required in addi-
tion. The same observations were analyzed by Patrick et al.
(2012) where a relativistic line was detected but with a lower
value of equivalent width (∼ 30 eV). In this work the param-
eters of the relline component, such as the emissivity index,
the inclination and the inner radius, were left free to vary,
whereas some parameters were ﬁxed in our work. This may
partially account for the diﬀerence in derived broad line EW.
Recently, a NuSTAR observation of NGC 5506 was analyzed
by Matt et al. (2015). A signiﬁcant relativistic Fe Kα line
was not required in their ﬁtting of that spectrum, perhaps
suggesting a variation of the intensity of the line between
the Suzaku and NuSTAR observations, which are separated
by ∼7 years.

The results of the analysis on the bright Seyfert
1 galaxy,
IC 4329A are consistent with the work of
Mantovani et al. (2014), where the same ﬁve Suzaku ob-
servations were analysed, plus an additional Suzaku obser-
vation which is simultaneous with a NuSTAR observation.
This spectrum was analysed by Brenneman et al. (2014) but
only a moderately broad Fe Kα line was detected using a
simple gaussian model with an equivalent width of 34+8
−7 eV.
Considering only one observation of this source, it was not
possible to constrain any parameters of the relativistic model
for the Fe Kα line (Brenneman et al. 2014). In this work,
we considered all 6 Suzaku observations available in archive,
which allowed us to better constrain the parameters of the
relativistic line, such as the inclination of the disk (30◦) and
the inner radius (6 rg), which are also in agreement with the
previous work of Mantovani et al. (2014). We detected the
relativistic line at 95 per cent conﬁdence in 3 observations
out of 6, with a mean value for the equivalent width of ∼
86 eV. Mantovani et al. (2014) pointed out that this spec-
tral feature was detected only in the combined data because
of the weakness of the feature and relatively poor statis-
tics of the single observations. Our results on this source
are fully consistent with this scenario. The same observa-
tions were analyzed by Patrick et al. (2012). Using the same
model component for modelling the relativistic Fe line (i.e.
relline), and they found an equivalent width of 69+13
−14 eV,
slightly lower than the value found in our analysis. This
diﬀerence could be due to the fact that they modelled the
mean spectrum and not the single observations separately
and also again to the fact that the parameters of the relline
model were free to vary.

As discussed above, a relativistic Fe Kα line was already
detected in MCG +8-11-11 in the same SUZAKU observa-
tion with an equivalent width of about 90 eV (Bianchi et al.
2010), and our measurements are consistent with these re-
sults (EW = 92+23

−23 eV).

Previous work on NGC 7213 (Lobban et al. 2010) has
not revealed the presence of a relativistic emission line,
whereas our analysis shows this component to be present
in the Suzaku spectra. In the work of Lobban et al. (2010)
the same Suzaku observation of NGC 7213 was considered.

In their work, a diskline model was used assuming an incli-
nation of the disk of 30◦ and the inner radius of 6rg, but an
upper limit was found for the ﬂux of the relativistic Fe line.
However, in our work diﬀerent combinations of inner radii
and inclinations were tested. We do detect a relativistic Fe
Kα line with an equivalent width of 233+80
−80 eV adopting an
inclination of 80◦ and inner radius of 6rg.

As with the other objects in our sample, Mrk 110 is a
source which did not show evidence for a relativistic Fe line
in previous XMM-Newton data (Nandra et al. 2007). We do
ﬁnd such evidence, albeit at marginal statistic signiﬁcance
(∼95 per cent conﬁdence). The same Suzaku observation
was also analyzed by Walton et al. (2013), who also found
evidence for a broad Fe component.

Beppo-SAX observations of NGC 7469 revealed the
presence of both the relativistic Fe Kα line (EW = 121+100
−100
eV) and the associated Compton hump (De Rosa et al.
2002). Our results on this source are consistent with this
work (EW = 81+27
−24 eV). The same Suzaku spectrum was
also analyzed by Patrick et al. (2012), who ﬁtted the data
with a relativistic line with an equivalent width consistent
within the errors with our result (EW= 91+9

−8 eV).

Finally, there are two objects in our sample where the
evidence for any relativistic Fe Kα emission line is very weak,
those being NGC 5548 and Mrk 590. We note that no broad
Fe Kα line was detected also in previous observations of
these objects (NGC 5548: Brenneman et al. 2012, Mrk 590:
Longinotti et al. 2007). In both of these sources, however,
the constraints on any broad component in the spectrum
are poor, with upper limits typically several 100 eV, usually
in excess of the typical EW for the detected broad lines of
∼ 50 − 100 eV. The apparent absence of a broad features
is therefore like due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the
data.

Overall, our results are broadly consistent with the
idea that relativistic Fe Kα emission line is ubiquitous in
the X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of detec-
tion in some sources and/or observations can be attributed
to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra analyzed.
This result conﬁrms previous conclusions from the analy-
sis of XMM-Newton spectra, where it was claimed that high
signal-to-noise ratio is necessary for the detection of broad
Fe lines of typical equivalent width (e.g. Guainazzi et al.
2006; Nandra et al. 2007; de La Calle P´erez et al. 2010).
Our sample analysis shows that broad line are consistently
detected when the counts in the 5-7 keV energy band are &
4 × 104.

Taking advantage of the extended energy band of
SUZAKU, we were also able to examine the relationship
between the emission of the Fe Kα line and the reﬂection
continuum at higher energies. In particular, we compared
the ﬁts with our Relativistic Relline model, which allows the
Fe line and reﬂection strengths to vary independently, with
a more self-consistent reﬂection model (Relativistic Pexmon
model), in which the line and Compton hump are linked
in the ratio expected for a Compton-thick slab. For the
vast majority of the observations (19/22), this self-consistent
model gives a better or comparable ﬁt to the phenomenolog-
ical Relativistic Relline model. This shows that in general
the line and reﬂection strengths in AGN are consistent with
each other, in support of the idea that both arise from the
same material. In two cases the self-consistent model leads

to an inadequate ﬁt, that of MCG +8-11-11 and in one of
the spectra of IC 4329A, which shows a diﬀerence in ﬁts
statistic of ∆χ2 > 50. Surprisingly, these two observations
exhibit this behaviour for opposite reasons.

In MCG +8-11-11, as already noted by Bianchi et al.
(2010), strong evidence for a relativistic Fe line is present,
but with the absence of any reﬂection emission at high en-
ergy. A possible explanation for the lack of reﬂection in this
source could be a low value of the high energy cut oﬀ (e.g.
∼ 50 keV). This hypothesis could be tested using high en-
ergy data of higher quality, as can be expected e.g. from
NuSTAR.

The opposite situation pertains to one observation of
IC 4329A (Obs. ID: 702113020). In this spectrum the rela-
tivistic line was not detected, with a tight upper limit, while
a strong reﬂection continuum is observed at high energies.
This is very puzzling, especially when considered in con-
text with the other observations of IC 4329A with Suzaku.
These do show both a relativistic line and a reﬂection con-
tinuum, with strengths that are typically consistent with
each other. The lack of consistency in just one case argues
against some interpretations, such as an unusual Fe abun-
dance in the reﬂecting material. A possible explanation for
the results is rapid variability of the geometry of the inner
regions of the disk, for example variability of the illuminat-
ing pattern and/or ionization state of the disk, or strong
relativistic eﬀects (e.g. Iwasawa et al. 1996; Miniutti et al.
2003). These might results in unusual line and continuum
properties, such as strong line proﬁle variations, or extreme
broadening of the line, which may make it diﬃcult to dis-
tinguish from the continuum. Overall, however, it is diﬃcult
to provide a robust interpretation for why in this source the
line and reﬂection continuum would not follow each other.
If the two components can exhibit diﬀerential variability of
this kind, it is not only diﬃcult to explain, but also diﬃcult
to make predictions which would allow models to be tested.
This is troublesome for the standard reﬂection models, and
unless an interpretational framework can be established, di-
minishes their diagnostic power.
