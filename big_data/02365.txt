Abstract—Besides the determined construction of polar codes
in BEC channels, different construction techniques have been
proposed for AWGN channels. The current state-of-the-art al-
gorithm starts with a design-SNR (or an operating SNR) and
then processing is carried out to approximate each individual bit
channel. However, as found in this paper, for fading channels,
an operating SNR can not be directly used in approximating
the bit channels. To achieve a better BER performance, the
input SNR for the polar code construction in fadding channels
is derived. A selection of the design-SNR for both the AWGN
and the fading channels from an information theoretical point
of view is studied. Also presented in this paper is the study of
sacriﬁcing a small data rate to gain orders of magnitude increase
in the BER performance.

I. INTRODUCTION

Polar codes have been proposed by Erdal Arıkan in [1]. The
fact is that polar codes can achieve the channel capacity at a
low encoding and decoding complexity of O(N log N ). The
original format of polar codes in [1] is non-systematic. Later,
a systematic version of polar codes was invented by Arıkan
in [2], which is shown to outperform the non-systematic polar
codes in terms of the BER performance.

Channel combining and splitting realize the polarization of
N channels. After these two stages, channels are polarized
in the sense that bits transmitting in these channels either
experience almost noiseless channels or almost completely
noisy channels for a large N . Then one can easily achieve
a rate of transmission close to the channel capacity, simply
by choosing to transmit over the good bit channels and ﬁx the
bits in bad channels. However, at a ﬁnite block length N and a
data rate R = K/N (K being the number of information bits
in each codeword of length N ). A ranking algorithm of the
bit channels according to their bit error rate (BER) becomes
necessary to select K good channels out of the N channels.
This selection of bit channels completely deﬁnes a polar code
for any given underlying channel.

In this paper, we consider the underlying channels to be
AWGN channels and fading channels. To select the good
indices in a AWGN channel, as stated in [1], a Monte-
Carlo simulation can be used to sort the bit channels. This
algorithm has a high complexity of O(M N log N ), where
M is the number of iterations of the Monte-Carlo simulation.
A more recent construction algorithm for AWGN channels is
proposed by Tal and Vardy [3] which is based on an earlier
proposal from Mori and Tanaka [4] [5]. The algorithm in [3]
is by far the best construction algorithm with a complexity of
O(N · µ2 log µ) where µ is a user deﬁned variable (Note that

this complexity excludes the quantization of a AWGN channel
to a discrete-alphabet channel). In [6], the estimation of bit-
channels based on a Gaussian approximation is proposed.
This was found to well-approximate the actual bit-channels
of polar codes in [7] and [8]. A similar algorithm after the
original proposal in [6] was studied in [7], [8]. The Gaussian
approximation algorithm involves relatively higher complexity
function computations, with a complexity of O(N ) function
computations (excluding the selection of K best among N
metrics obtained).

From the discussions of the constructions of [1], [3], [6]–
[8] for AWGN channels, it’s seen that all algorithms start
with a speciﬁed value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
In practice, it’s difﬁcult (or expensive) to compute the code
indices with the variation of the SNR. Hence, a design-SNR
is desired to construct polar codes that produce a good BER
performance for a given data rate R and possible variations
of the system SNR. In [9], a design-SNR is produced from
extensive simulations.

In this paper, we propose a selection of the design-SNR
for any data rate R from an information theoretical analysis.
For a system with an operating SNR and a data rate R, a
design-SNR can be used to obtain the code indices instead of
the operating SNR. Both AWGN channels and block fading
channels are considered in the analysis of this paper. In
block fading channels, we also conduct a study of sacriﬁcing
a small data rate in the large-SNR region to gain orders
of magnitude increase of the BER performance. Simulation
results are provided to verify the validness of the selection of
the design-SNR and the great increase of the BER performance
at a small cost of the data rate.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we describe fundamentals of non-systematic polar code and
systematic polar code. Section III introduces a transmission
scheme which can improve the BER performance in orders of
magnitude at a small cost to the data rate in fading channels.
In Section IV, we analyze the design-SNR and present a
selection of the design-SNR for both the AWGN and the fading
channels. We ﬁnally present our simulation results in Section
V and conclude this paper in Section VI.

II. POLAR CODE FUNDAMENTALS

In this section, the relevant theories about non-systematic

polar codes and systematic polar codes are presented.

A. Non-Systematic Polar Codes
be

A polar

speciﬁed

completely

code may

by
(N, K,A, uAc), where N is the length of a codeword,
K is the number of information bits encoded per codeword,
A is a set of K indices called information bit locations from
{1, 2, ...., N − 1, N}, and uAc consists of the frozen bits. For
an (N, K,A, uAc ) polar code, a codeword is obtained as:

x = uA · GA + uAc · GAc

(1)
where GA denotes the submatrix of G formed by the rows
with indices in A, and G equals F ⊗n for any n = log2 N .
Here F is the standard polarizing kernel F = (cid:0) 1 1
0 1(cid:1).
The Successive Cancellation Decoding (SCD) algorithm in
[1] uses a decoding operation that is similar to the belief
propagation (BP) algorithm. The likelihoods evolve in the
inverse direction from the right to the left, as illustrated with
an example in [1], using a pair of likelihood transformation
equations. Then the bit decisions are made at the left of the
circuit and is used in the rest of the decisions.

B. Systematic Polar Codes

The systematic polar code split the codeword into two parts

by writing x = (xB, xBc ). So (1) can be written as

xB = uA · GAB + uAc · GAcB
xBc = uA · GABc + uAc · GAcBc

(2)

(3)

where the G = F ⊗n and F = (cid:0) 1 0
1 1(cid:1), the matrix GAB is a sub-
matrix of the generator matrix with elements (Gi,j )i∈A,j∈B,
and similarly for the other submatrices. The proposition in [2]
says that if (and only if) A and B have the same number of ele-
ments and GAB is invertible, there exists a systematic encoder
(B, uAc). It performs the mapping xB 7→ x = (xB, xBc). The
vector uA can be obtained by computing

uA = (xB − uAcGAcB)(GAB)−1

(4)
In [2], we’ve known that B = A is the necessary conditions of
establishing the one-to-one mapping xB 7→ uA. In the rest of
the paper, the systematic encoding of poalr codes will use A,
instead of B. So, the mapping of (2) and (3) can be rewritten
as:
(5)

xA = uA · GAA + uAc · GAcA
xAc = uA · GAAc + uAc · GAcAc

(6)

III. POLAR CODES TRANSMISSION OVER

FADING CHANNELS

In this section, we present a transmission scheme which
can improve the BER performance in orders of magnitude at
a small cost to the data rate.

The underlying channel we consider is

y = h · ˜x + n

(7)
where h follows a normal distribution N (0, 1), n is the
additive white Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance σ2,
and ˜x is the binary modulated transmitted symbol: {0, 1} →

{1,−1}. The encoded bits x = uG is thus modulated to
˜x. The N channels experienced by ˜x, denoted as h, are
assumed to be i.i.d and are stable for Nb code blocks. This is a
block fading channel model which can be observed in various
wireless communication scenarios. In our study, assume h is
known at the receiver. With the channel estimation of h, the
underlying channel in (7) can be converted to:

˜y = |h| · ˜x + n

(8)

Due to the limitations of the channel estimation algorithms,
there is a limit of the channel values below which the estima-
tion is unreliable. In this paper, we do not attempt to discuss
the limitations of various channel estimation algorithms. In-
stead, we keep this limit of channel values as a variable α. As
seen in the sequel, the change of α with channel estimation
algorithms does not increase the complexity of our algorithm.
For a given α, a percentage can be calculated: p = Pr{|h| ≤
α}, which translates to the fact that ⌊N ∗ p⌋ observations at
the receiver are not reliable. These unreliable observations
in return will cause a poor BER performance. In this case,
to maintain a given BER performance, either a higher SNR
or a lower data rate can be applied. Here a question arises:
whether the SNR should be increased or the data rate should
be lowered? Which selection yields a better performance? To
answer this question, we resort to the work of [10] for the
asymptotic behavior of polar codes. The relationship of the
block error rate Pe with the data rate R and the capacity of
the underlying channel I(W ) is rewritten as below from [10]

(11)

As the evaluation of (11) is not closed, we can use an upper

bound of C ≤ C(E{|h|}√γ) to approximate I(W ). The
function Pe is concave in terms of the data rate R when ﬁxing
I(W ). It’s also concave in terms of SN R=γ for a ﬁxed data
rate R. Fig. 1 shows Pe as a function of the data rate R
under several SNR values. From Fig. 1, we can see clearly
that with a ﬁxed data rate, increasing SNR does not yield
a signiﬁcant BER performance increase at high SNR regions.
Instead, decreasing the data rate R is a better choice. With this
principle, we propose the following Algorithm 1 to improve
the BER performance in fading channels whenever a certain
amount of bad channels are detected. In this algorithm, Qs is

Algorithm 1: The algorithm to obtain new good chan-
nel indices and bad channel indices in fading channels
whenever a certain amount of bad channels are detected

With Algorithm 1, a system in a fading channel ﬁrst selects
a α according to the channel estimation algorithm. Then
another value M = ⌊N p⌋ is selected which can be a tradeoff

between the BER performance and the data rate decrease.
When M (or any number smaller than M ) unreliable channel
estimations are detected, a data rate decrease is performed:
M ∗ c channels are changed from the data-bearing channels to
the frozen channels. Here c is the calculated channel capacity
according to the operating SNR = γ and the capacity of
C = C(E{|h|}γ) in (11). This decrease of M ∗ c is that the
M unreliable observations theoretically lose M ∗c information
bits.
It’s worthwhile to emphasize that the variation of α and M
does not increase the complexity of Algorithm 1. This resides
in the choice of the sorted channels Qs. A change of α and M
only changes the number M ∗ c which eventually only results
in how many entries are selected from Qs. As long as Qs is
provided, the complexity does not change with the variation
of the parameter α and M . In the next Section, we provide a
theoretical way to construct Qs for a given data rate R.

IV. DESIGN-SNR ANALYSIS

For a system with an operating SNR = γ and a data rate R
in AWGN channels, a construction based on [3] can be carried
out with this γ. Theoretically, with any change in SNR, a new
construction should be obtained to accommodate this change
of SNR. However, to a lot of systems, a real time construction
is too complicated to perform. In [9], a design-SNR is found
from simulations which can produce a good BER performance
for a range of SNRs. In this paper, we provide an information
theoretical foundation for the existence of the design-SNR for
a ﬁxed data rate R.

Let’s ﬁrst look at the AWGN channels. The constellation
constrained channel capacity of the AWGN channel is shown
in (10) with h = 1. For a ﬁxed data rate R, the required SNR
= γ to achieve this data rate R can be obtained as:

γ = C−1(R)

(12)

where C−1(x) is the inverse function of C(x) in (11). Let’s
denote the required SNR for a data rate R as γR. For a ﬁxed
data rate R, this γR is the design-SNR which should be used
for the construction of polar codes.

For fading channels, in order to use the construction algo-
rithm like [3], we need to convert the channel in (8) to an
AWGN channel. One way to do this is to take the mean of
the channel in (8) with respect to h

h{˜y} ≈ E{|h|} · ˜x + n
E

(13)

which has an equivalent SN R of

(14)
In (14), µ = E{|h|}. For the normal distribution h, µ ≈ 0.4.
Therefore, we have

γh = E{|h|}2γ = µ2γ.

γh (dB) = γ (dB) − 8 (dB)

(15)

If a point-by-point construction is to be carried out for the
underlying channel in (7), then the input SNR for the con-
struction algorithm should be a modiﬁed version γh shown

in (15) instead of directly using the operating SNR γ. This
point is veriﬁed in the simulation results in the next section:
the BER performance of polar codes constructed using γ is
poorer than that constructed by γh.

Like AWGN channels, a design-SNR also exists for fading
channels. However, from the simulation results, we ﬁnd that
the design-SNR does not follow the relationship shown in
(15): a design-SNR of γR for a AWGN channel does not
produce a design-SNR γRh = γR − 8 (all in dB) for the
fading channel in (7). Surprisingly, AWGN channels and the
fading channels in (7) share the same design-SNR. Simulation
results are provided to show the performance of the design-
SNR selections for AWGN channels and fading channels.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To verify the fading channel transmission scheme of polar
codes in Algorithm 1 and the design-SNR selection, simulation
results are provided in this section. All
the polar codes
construction in this section are based on [3].

Algorithm 1 is carried out using the following parameters:
N = 1024, R = 0.36, α = 0.2, and M = 64. The sorted
channel indices Qs are generated in two ways: 1) point-by-
point construction of (15); 2) the design-SNR for the data
rate R = 0.36. The design-SNR is computed using (12). For
R = 0.36, the desgin-SNR is computed to be −1.822 dB.
The BER performance of systematic polar codes are shown in
Fig. 2, where the solid squared line is the original BER per-
formance with code indices selected from the point-by-point
construction with the input SNR given in (15) and the solid
line with diamonds is the BER performance of polar codes
constructed this way with Algorithm 1 running at the same
time. Clearly, the BER performance is greatly improved with
Algorithm 1: the BER is reduced by 21 times while the data
rate is only reduced by 15%. The two dashed lines in Fig. 2
are the corresponding BER performance using the design-SNR
-1.822 dB instead of a point-by-point construction. The same
improvement is observed when running our Algorithm 1.

Fig. 3 shows the BER performance comparison between
the construction using the design-SNR and the point-by-point
construction in AWGN channels. The polar code has a block
length N = 1024 and R = 0.36. The design-SNR for this
case is the same as in Fig. 2. The two solid lines in Fig. 3 are
the non-systematic BER performance using the point-by-point
construction and the design-SNR construction. From Fig. 3, it
can be seen that the BER performance of non-systematic polar
codes using the design-SNR construction matches closely with
the point-by-point construction. The same can be seen for the
systematic polar codes.

The simulation results of the design-SNR in fading channels
are shown in Fig. 4. The polar code block length is again
N = 1024 and the data rate is R = 0.36. According to Section
IV, in fading channels, the design-SNR is the same as that
of the AWGN channels. Therefore in this case, the design-
SNR is -1.822 dB. The two square lines (solid and dashed)
are the BER performance of non-systematic and systematic
polar codes constructed point-by-point using the operating

the BER performance of non-systematic and systematic polar
codes constructed point-by-point using the operating SNR - 8
as shown in (15). And the two lines (solid and dashed)
with hexagrams are the BER performance of non-systematic
and systematic polar codes constructed using the design-SNR
−1.822 dB. The ﬁrst thing to notice from Fig. 4 is that the
BER performance of both the systematic and non-systematic
polar codes with the point-by-point construction using the
operating SNR is much worse than the construction using
SNR - 8 and the design-SNR of -1.822 dB. This shows that the
point-by-point construction of polar codes in fading channels
of (7) should use an input SNR in (15) instead of directly using
the operating SNR. In the mean time, the BER performance of
both the systematic and non-systematic polar codes with the
design-SNR is either better or equal to that of the point-by-
point construction using SNR - 8 dB. The design-SNR clearly
can be used for the polar code construction in fading channels.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a fading channel transmission
scheme of polar codes which can greatly improve the BER
performance at a small cost to the data rate. An algorithm is
given to implement the proposed scheme. In the mean time,
a design-SNR selection is proposed based on an information
theoretical analysis. This design-SNR selection is valid for
both the AWGN channels and fading channels. Simulation

 

results are provided which veriﬁed the transmission scheme
and the design-SNR selection.
