The spatial conﬁnement and the propagation length of surface waves in a single-layer two-
dimensional atomic crystal are analysed in term of its surface susceptibility and its surface con-
ductivity. Based on the values of these macroscopic parameters, extracted from experimental obser-
vations, it is conﬁrmed that graphene supports a transverse magnetic non-radiating surface mode in
the ultraviolet spectral region while a single-layer hexagonal Boron-Nitride is predicted to support a
transverse electric non-radiating surface mode in the visible spectrum. This last mode, at a vacuum
wavelength of 633 nm, has a spatial conﬁnement of 15 microns and an intensity-propagation distance
greater than 2 cm.

Surface electromagnetic waves have attracted lot of at-
tention because of their fundamental interest and their
possible technological impact [1]. The transverse evanes-
cence of these modes renders them suitable for a broad
range of applications because of the possibility to guide
them along an interface. Recently the research in sur-
face electromagnetic modes has been further boosted
by the advent of two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals
[2]. These materials are essentially single or few atomic
planes pulled out of a bulk crystal. They are stable under
ambient conditions, exhibit high crystal quality, and are
continuous on a macroscopic scale [2].

In particular single-layer 2D atomic crystals have as-
tonishing optical properties [3, 4]. Their linear and non-
linear optical response shows that they behave as zero-
thickness interfaces [5–7]. In analogy to a bulk material
for which it is possible to deﬁne an electrical suscepti-
bility and a conductivity, it is possible to characterize a
single-layer 2D crystal in terms of its surface electrical
susceptibility and its surface conductivity. Exactly as for
a 3D material these two quantities are experimentally
accessible via ellipsometry [5, 8]. Optical absorption or
optical contrast measurements [3, 5, 9] are other experi-
mental techniques that can be used to partially ﬁx them.
Two-dimensional crystals can support surface electro-
magnetic waves. It has been predicted [10–12] and exper-
imentally shown that highly conﬁned surface plasmons
can propagate on graphene [13–15]. Apart from a lo-
calized transverse magnetic (TM) mode it was predicted
that graphene can support also a transverse electromag-
netic (TE) mode [16]. To date the existence of such a
mode has only been experimentally proved in multi-layer
graphene but not on a single-layer atomic crystal [17].

Owing to the 2D nature of the collective excitations
it was conﬁrmed that the conﬁnement of surface plas-
mons in graphene is much stronger than that of metallic
surface plasmons. This means that graphene is ideally
suited to conﬁne light down to extremely small volumes.
Also because of a large wave vector mismatch of graphene
plasmons compared to free-space light, plasmon excita-
tion and detection by light is very ineﬃcient. In spite of

that marvelous experiments have successfully achieved it
[14, 15]. Real space imaging of propagating graphene
plasmons has permitted the measurement of their prop-
agation length. One of the most appealing advantages
of graphene plasmonics is the possibility to electrically
control the conﬁnement and the propagation length of
surface plasmons. Experiments [14, 15] have indeed con-
ﬁrmed the theoretical predictions that these quantities
depend on doping [18–20].

Thus far strong surface plasmon damping has been
observed on a graphene interface. Damping can be
reduced when graphene-hexagonal-Boron-Nitride het-
erostructures [21] are considered. Propagation lengths
of hundreds of nanometers have been observed for a vac-
uum exciting wavelength of 10 microns [22]. Even if this
is still a strong sub-wavelength damping, plasmonics in
these heterostructures preserves the high ﬁeld conﬁne-
ment typical of the 2D systems.

Infrared nano-imaging has also been used to study vol-
ume conﬁned phonon-polaritons in a ﬂat slab of hexag-
onal Boron-Nitride (BN) [23, 24]. The measured disper-
sion of polaritonic waves was shown to be governed by
the crystal thickness according to a scaling law that per-
sists down to a few atomic layers [25, 26]. A surface
phonon-polariton propagating within a three layer thin
ﬂake of hexagonal BN was reported at an angular fre-
quency around 1550 cm-1 [25]. Even in this case anyway
a strong damping was observed.

Here I treat the surface electromagnetic modes of a
single-layer 2D atomic crystal in terms of its surface con-
ductivity and its surface electrical susceptibility. I show
how the radiative or non-radiative character of these
modes can be easily deduced from these quantities. Two
speciﬁc examples: conducting graphene and insulating
single-layer hexagonal BN will be discussed, based on
the values of these macroscopic measurable parameters
extracted from experimental observations. Boron-Nitride
is predicted to support a TE mode with a very long prop-
agation distance in the visible spectrum.

I follow an approach similar to the one used by Raether
[27] for treating surface plasmon polaritons on a metallic

electric ﬁeld is:

ˆκ ∧ (~E2 − ~E1) = 0

and for the magnetic ﬁeld:

surface. Consider a ﬂat single-layer 2D crystal located
at the interface in between two dielectric media (Fig.1),
on which a TE or a TM surface electromagnetic wave
propagates in the y direction. In the two half-spaces (1)
and (2) separated by the crystal the electric ﬁeld for the
TE mode is given by:

~E 1(x, y, z, t) = (Ex1, 0, 0)ei(ωt−ky1y−kz1z)
~E 2(x, y, z, t) = (Ex2, 0, 0)ei(ωt−ky2y−kz2z)

z < 0 (1)

z > 0

and the magnetic ﬁeld for the TM mode by:

~H 1(x, y, z, t) = (Hx1, 0, 0)ei(ωt−ky1y−kz1z)
~H 2(x, y, z, t) = (Hx2, 0, 0)ei(ωt−ky2y−kz2z)

z < 0 (2)

z > 0

where ω is the angular frequency of the light and ky and
kz are the components of the wave vector for the surface
modes. These ﬁelds have to fulﬁll Maxwell’s equations
and in particular the magnetic ﬁeld for the TE mode is
given by:

rot ~E m = −µ0

∂ ~H m

∂t

and the electric ﬁeld for the TM mode is given by:

rot ~H m = ǫ0ǫm

∂ ~E m
∂t

~J = ~JP + ~Jσ = (iǫ0χω + σ)((ˆκ ∧ ~Em) ∧ ˆκ)

(7)
where, because of (5), ~J does not depend on m and where
ǫ0 is the vacuum permittivity, χ the electric surface sus-
ceptibility of the 2D crystal, and σ its surface conductiv-
ity [5]. Finally the relation:

zm = ǫmk2

must be considered, where k is the magnitude of the wave
vector of light in vacuum. From (1), (3), (5), (6), (7) and
(8) I obtain for the TE mode:

where Re and Im are the real and the imaginary part of

In agreement with ref. [12], formula (12) conﬁrms that
if χ < 0 the TE surface mode is not a proper solution
because it is exponentially growing in the z direction. If
χ > 0, from formulas (12) and (13) a non-radiating, spa-
tially conﬁned TE surface mode exists if k2χ2 −σ2η2 > 0.
This has not been noted in [12]. In totally agreement with
[12] formulas (15) and (16) conﬁrm that a non-radiating,
spatially conﬁned TM mode is possible only for χ < 0.

Based on experimental values of χ and σ I show now
that graphene supports a proper TM surface wave mode
in the ultraviolet spectrum and a single-layer hexagonal
BN supports a proper TE surface wave mode in the vis-
ible spectrum. The spatial conﬁnement and the propa-
gation distance of these modes are reported. The χ and
the σ for graphene in the visible and ultraviolet spectral
range have been determined in [5]. The χ and the σ for
a single-layer hexagonal BN will be extracted here from
published experimental data [28].

For graphene in the spectral range 450 nm < λ < 750
nm we have χ = 8 · 10−10 m and σ = 6 · 10−5 Ω−1. If we
consider a free-standing graphene ﬁlm, from these values
and formula (13) it is clear that the TE mode in the
visible part of the spectrum is a radiative one (Re(ky) <
k). The TM mode (formula (15)) is not spatially conﬁned
in the z direction.
In the same paper values of χ =
−1.2 · 10−9 m and of σ = 18.6 · 10−5 Ω−1 at a wavelength
of 270 nm are reported. In this second case the TE mode
is not spatially conﬁned in the z direction. The TM mode
is a proper one with a spatial conﬁnement of the ﬁeld
[27] 1/ |Im(kz)| = 4.4 nm and an intensity propagation
length [27] of 1/ |2 · Im(ky)| = 8.7 · 10−1 nm. This mode
has already been observed in ref. [13].

I treat now the case of a single-layer hexagonal BN.
From ref. [28] that reports optical contrast measurements
of BN on top of a SiO2/Si wafer with a SiO2 thickness
of 290 nm, and the analysis used in ref. [5] it is possible
to extract the value of χ = (1.3 ± 0.1) · 10−9 m and an
upper limit for σ ≤ 2 · 10−6 Ω−1. Figure 2 reports the
experimental data published in Fig (2) of ref.
[28] that
have been extracted from the original paper via software
digitization. The observed contrast is a non-monotonic
function of λ and changes its sign at 530 nm. From sim-

FIG. 2. Optical contrast as a function of the incident wave-
length for a single-layer BN on top of a SiO2/Si wafer (290
nm SiO2). Dots are experimental data extracted from ref.
[28]. The solid line is the best ﬁt assuming χ = 1.3 · 10−9
m, σ ≤ 2 · 10−6 Ω−1 and a SiO2 thickness of 290 nm. Vary-
ing χ or σ does not improve in any way the ﬁt. The only
way to improve the ﬁt is by varying the SiO2 thickness, show-
ing that the spectral position of the optical contrast curve
depends much on the substrate. Dash line is the ﬁt for the
same values of χ and σ but a SiO2 thickness of 270 nm.

ulations it emerges that the optical contrast for BN is
sensitive to the sign of χ. If the sign of χ is reversed the
sign of the contrast is reversed. The maximum and the
minimum values of the contrast increase with the magni-
tude of χ. Increasing σ shifts the curve upwards. This is
the reason why for graphene the contrast is either posi-
tive or negligible [9]. The spectral position for which the
contrast changes sign depends a lot on the substrate and
not on χ or σ. The two ﬁts reported in ﬁg. 2 are for
the same best values of χ and σ. One is for the nominal
thickness of 290 nm SiO2 reported in [28] and the best
one for a thickness of 270 nm SiO2. No other experimen-
tal data have been found in literature to better ﬁx χ and
σ.

Even if I choose the upper possible value for σ =
2·10−6 Ω−1, from formulas (12) and (13) a free-standing,
single-layer BN supports a non-radiative TE surface
mode in the visible part of the spectrum. The spatial
conﬁnement of the ﬁeld for a wavelength of 633 nm is 15
µm, (a weakly localized mode) and the intensity propa-
gation length is 2 cm, a surprising macroscopic distance.
For a smaller conductivity, that it is not possible to ex-
clude here, this propagation distance will be proportion-
ally longer (formula 14). This mode exists not only for
a free-standing crystal but also if a single-layer BN is
embedded in a dielectric (formulas 9). The TM surface
mode is not spatially conﬁned in the z direction.

The validity of the equations here reported is not lim-

ited to graphene or single-layer BN. They can be applied
to any single-layer 2D crystal, for instance transition-
metal dichalcogenides. By elucidating the role of χ and
σ in the properties of surface electromagnetic waves in
2D materials, this paper may proﬁt to the experimental
research in this ﬁeld.

Based on experimental values of χ and σ, I have shown
that graphene supports a non radiating TM surface mode
in the ultraviolet spectral region while a single-layer
hexagonal BN supports a non-radiative TE surface mode
in the visible spectrum. The two modes have very dif-
ferent properties. The TM mode has a very high spatial
conﬁnement and an exceedingly short propagation dis-
tance. The TE mode has a weak spatial conﬁnement
and a long propagation distance.

While TM surface waves in graphene have been ob-
served both in the ultraviolet [13] and in the infrared
electromagnetic spectrum [14, 15], a TE surface mode has
never been observed on any single-layer two-dimensional
atomic crystal [29, 30]. Boron-Nitride can be a good can-
didate for its observation in the visible spectrum. When
compared with the TM mode in graphene, this TE mode
has a giant propagation length. This makes it interest-
ing both from a fundamental point of view as well as for
technical applications.
