Complete control of the state of a quantum bit (qubit) is a fundamental requirement for any

quantum information processing (QIP) system. For this purpose, all-optical control techniques oﬀer

the advantage of a well-localized and potentially ultrafast manipulation of individual qubits in multi-

qubit systems. Fast manipulation, however, requires qubits with large electronic level splittings to

enable the use of broadband laser pulses. For qubits in the solid state, which are advantageous due

to their good scalability, only semiconductor quantum dots fulﬁl these conditions so far [1]. However,

to achieve a Λ-type electronic level conﬁguration with a large enough level splitting, charged dots in

strong magnetic ﬁelds have to be used [2] and typical electron spin coherence times are on the order

of one nanosecond [3, 4] without employing nuclear ﬁeld locking techniques or spin echo sequences.
Recently, the negatively charged silicon vacancy centre (SiV−) in diamond has emerged as a novel
promising system for QIP due to its superior spectral properties [5] and advantageous electronic
structure [6, 7]: The SiV− oﬀers an optically accessible Λ-type level structure with a large orbital
level splitting even without the need of an external magnetic ﬁeld and previous studies determined

the ground state coherence time of the centre to be on the order of 35-45 ns [8, 9]. While these studies
already indicate the feasibility of ultrafast all-optical coherent control of the SiV−, no experimental
realization has been presented so far. Here, we report on optical Rabi oscillations and Ramsey
interference between the ground and the excited state of the SiV− using 12 ps long, resonant rotation
pulses. Moreover, utilizing a Λ-scheme, we demonstrate Raman-based coherent Rabi rotations and

Ramsey interference within the ground state manifold using a single, 1 ps long oﬀ-resonant pulse.

These measurements prove the accessibility of the complete set of single-qubit operations relying
solely on optical ﬁelds and pave the way for high-speed QIP applications using SiV− centres.
Conﬁned spin impurities, known as colour centres, in a spin-free diamond host lattice have proven to be promising
systems for QIP as well as sensing applications, with the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy centre (NV−) being the
most prominent example [10, 11]. Over the past couple of years the SiV− emerged as a steadily growing competitor to
the NV− due to its superior spectral properties such as intense, narrow zero phonon line (ZPL) emission at ambient
and cryogenic temperatures as well as small Huang-Rhys factors down to S=0.08 [5, 12]. The SiV− features a unique
molecular structure with an interstitial silicon atom in between two unoccupied carbon sites. The resulting inversion
symmetry of this split-vacancy conﬁguration is responsible for the high spectral stability of the SiV− by suppressing
ﬁrst-order Stark shifts and thus allows for the generation of indistinguishable photons from separate SiV− centres
[13]. In previous studies [6, 7], the electronic structure of the defect has been investigated in great detail revealing an
S= 1
2 system. Due to a strong spin orbit coupling [6], the centre features twofold orbitally split and spin degenerate
ground and excited states at zero magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 1a) leading to the characteristic four-line ﬁne structure in the
ZPL emission spectrum at 737 nm (Fig. 1b). These orbital states can be used to construct an SiV− based qubit
even without the need of an external magnetic ﬁeld and the large splitting of δg/2π=48 GHz in the ground and

1

δe/2π=259 GHz in the excited state allows for ultrafast optical coherent control. The ground state coherence time
T ∗
2 of the SiV− is limited by the orbital relaxation time T Orbit
=35 ns [9], which results from a single-phonon vibronic
process causing transitions between the orbital components of the ground state manifold [14]. Hence, by eliminating

1

these processes in future devices coherence times can be further extended. This can be achieved by either cooling the

samples below 1 K or by manipulating the phononic environment of the centre using phononic nanostructures [14].

The rapid development of nanofabrication [15, 16] and growth techniques [17] potentially allows for the fabrication of

diamond based phononic band gap materials [18] or small nanodiamonds to suppress ground state thermalization. As

a result, coherence times in the millisecond range seem feasible as the pure spin relaxation time has been determined
to be T Spin

of a qubit state. First, we demonstrate resonant angular control by coherently driving Rabi oscillations between the

ground and the excited state of the centre using 12 ps laser pulses. Figure 2a and b show the ﬂuorescence signal from

the excited state for variable pulse areas of the picosecond laser resonant with transitions C and B (see Fig. 1). High

contrast Rabi oscillations are evident in the photon count rate traces of both transitions with visibilities exceeding
90 % and are well-ﬁtted by a four level density matrix model (solid lines) [19]. Coherent rotations up to Θ ≈ 10π
for transition C and up to Θ ≈ 6π for transition B are observed without any signiﬁcant damping, with the rotation
angles being limited by the available laser power. Residual background ﬂuorescence of the diamond causes slight

upwards slopes in both curves.

The oscillations shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate rotation about the x axis of the Bloch sphere. However, full SU(2)

control requires rotation around a second axis. This can be achieved by exploiting the free precession of the state
about the vertical z axis of the Bloch sphere by employing a Ramsey-type pulse sequence consisting of two π
2 pulses
separated by a variable delay time. As the experimental resonance frequency is about 406.8 THz, the oscillations in

the signal are extremely fast and no single Ramsey fringes have been resolved. However, by ﬁne-tuning the temporal

spacing of the two pulses for a number of ﬁxed delays it is possible to determine the maximum and minimum

count rate at each ﬁxed delay point and therefore to measure the upper and lower envelopes of the Ramsey curve

which are shown in Fig. 3a for transitions B and C. Simulations (solid lines) using the four-level model show that

two eﬀects are responsible for the decrease of the Ramsey visibilities in Fig. 3b [19]. First, spontaneous decay and

thermalization eﬀects lead to a decoherence of the system. Secondly, a pure dephasing of the excited states of about

γ/2π=160 MHz, most likely caused by residual phonon broadening, has to be added to ﬁt the observed decrease in
visibility. Calculations of the excited state coherence times from these visibilities yield T ∗
2 =578 ps for the lower and
T ∗
2 =279 ps for the upper excited state, with the latter one decohering faster due to a rapid decay into the lower
state. The resulting linewidths ∆ν = (2πT ∗
2 )−1 of 275 MHz for C and 570 MHz for B are in very good agreement
with the linewidths measured using photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (270 MHz and 574 MHz) indicating
that coherently driving the SiV−, even with intense pulsed ﬁelds, does not alter its coherence properties.
The resonant control techniques presented so far require excitation of the SiV− and hence coherence times of such
a qubit are ultimately limited by the excited state dynamics. To harness the longer ground state coherence time of
the SiV−, coherent rotations solely within the ground state manifold are desirable. This can be achieved by driving
a Λ-type level scheme between the two ground and a common excited state. A Raman process then leads to a

coherent transfer of population between the ground states. To minimize an unwanted population of the excited state,

both arms of the Λ-scheme are far-detuned from one-photon resonance while still fulﬁlling a two-photon resonance

condition. We here simultaneously couple both transitions of the Λ-system employing a single broadband laser

pulse with a length of only 1 ps, red-detuned by ∆=500 GHz from the lower excited state [1, 20]. Furthermore,

initialization of the population into the lower ground state and readout is achieved by optical pumping of transition

D using resonant 200 ns long laser pulses [19]. After pumping the population in the upper ground state reaches a
minimum value of 22%. The spectral arrangement of the two lasers relative to the SiV− spectrum is depicted in
Fig. 4a and the pulse sequence as well as two count rate traces at two diﬀerent Raman pulse powers are shown in

Fig. 4b. As the two branches of the Λ-system have diﬀerent transition dipole moments and polarizations, driving

2

strengths of both Raman transitions have to be equalized to maximize transfer eﬃciency. This is carried out by

rotating the polarization of the Raman beam at a ﬁxed pulse power. At the optimized polarization, the population of

the upper ground state is measured for varying Raman pulse areas. The resulting curve is depicted in Fig. 4c, showing
a two-photon Rabi oscillation with rotation angles of up to Θ ≈ 2π, limited by the rotation laser power. As before,
the data is ﬁtted well by our model (solid curve) with the same set of experimentally measured parameters that have

been used for the one-photon experiments and with the relative driving strength of the two Raman transitions being

the only free parameter. The model also includes transfer via the second Λ-scheme between the ground states and
the upper excited state, from which the laser is detuned by ∆ + δe = 759 GHz. Simulations indicate that the decrease
in visibility for large angles is not due to ground state decoherence but due to slight resonant excitation of the excited
states for large pulse areas. In future experiments this can be minimized by modifying the laser system to provide

longer pulses with a duration of a few ps. To demonstrate full SU(2) control of the ground state, also a Ramsey-type

experiment has been performed and the resulting data is shown in Fig. 4d. Oscillations at the frequency of the
ground state splitting of δg/2π=48 GHz are clearly visible and are reproduced well by the model (solid line), without
any additional free parameters. The slight distortion of the curve is again due to resonant background ﬂuorescence

and the population does not reach the optically pumped minimum as a small amount of incoherent transfer occurs

[19, 20]. To resolve both issues in future experiments more complex transfer schemes with two separate rotation ﬁelds

can be employed, that avoid resonant excitation and allow for more accurate optimization of the relative transition

strengths. Moreover, a time delay between both ﬁelds can be used to optimize the adiabaticity of the process [21].

In conclusion we demonstrated resonant and oﬀ-resonant Raman-based coherent control of the rotation angle and axis
of the orbital degree of freedom of an SiV− employing ultrafast rotation pulses as short as 1 ps. All the experiments
in this work have been carried out on the orbital states of the SiV− without the need of a strong magnetic ﬁeld.
However, we’d like to emphasize that the techniques presented here can directly be applied to the spin states of the
SiV−. Although the coherence time is reduced for intermediate ﬁeld strengths, we demonstrated that it recovers in
the high ﬁeld regime [8]. This regime is required in any case to achieve large Zeeman splittings to enable the use of

ultrashort pulses. The results presented here provide the basis for a number of exciting QIP applications with the
SiV− such as cavity-assisted Raman transfer schemes [22, 23], coherent spin-photon interfaces [24], optical quantum
memories [25, 26] and quantum gates based on geometrical phase acquisition [27].

Methods

The sample consists of a type IIa high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) diamond with a cleaved (111) main surface. The
sample is implanted with a dose of 109 ions per cm2 of 28Si+ ions at an energy of 900 keV, resulting in an approximately 50 nm
thick layer of SiV− centres 500 nm below the diamond surface. After implantation the sample is annealed for 3 h at 1000◦C in
vacuum and for 1 h at 465◦C in air and cleaned in peroxomonosulfuric acid to remove graphite residues. To further enhance the
collection eﬃciency from the sample solid immersion lenses with a diameter of 1µm are milled into the diamond surface using

focused ion beam (FIB) milling. To cure the host lattice damage induced by the FIB milling process the sample is annealed a
second time using the above-mentioned protocol. The resulting colour centre density is approximately 0.2-0.4 SiV− per µm2
allowing the investigation of single centres in a homebuilt confocal microscope equipped with a liquid helium ﬂow cryostat and

an NA=0.9 objective. All investigations have been carried out at a temperature of 5 K. For the ultrafast control experiments

a tunable mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser provides hyperbolic secant pulses with a length of 1 ps at a repetition rate of 80 MHz.

The ground state Raman transfer is carried out without further ﬁltering at a wavelength of 738 nm for the Raman pulse. For

the resonant picosecond control experiments the bandwidth of these pulses has to be reduced to avoid excitation of multiple

transitions. Therefore the pulses are ﬁltered using a monolithic Fabry-Perot etalon (F=50, FSR=1000 GHz, ∆ν=20 GHz).

This results in Lorentzian-shaped pulses with a length of 12 ps suitable to selectively excite the ﬁne structure transitions of the
SiV−. Pulse intensities are stabilized using a feedback loop formed by a combination of a voice coil steering mirror in front of a
single mode optical ﬁbre and a photodiode after the ﬁbre connected to a PID controller. For the Raman transfer experiments

an initialization of the population into the lowest ground state as well as readout of the population in the upper ground

3

state after the transfer is necessary. This is achieved by excitation of transition D using a resonant continuous wave extended

cavity diode laser (ECDL) stabilized to a wavemeter. Initialization and readout pulses are generated from this laser using an

acousto-optic intensity modulator in single-pass conﬁguration. To generate a suﬃciently long time interval for initialization

and readout the repetition rate of the mode-locked laser has been reduced to 1 MHz using an electro-optic pulse picker cell

consisting of a Pockels cell in between two Glan-Taylor prisms providing a pulse suppression greater than 1000 when the cell
is switched oﬀ. State detection is carried out by detecting the light emitted from the SiV− phonon sideband using a single
photon detector attached to a fast counting electronics. The trigger signal provided by the pulsed laser or the pulse picker

cell, respectively, is used to synchronize the picosecond laser pulses with the pump and readout pulses from the ECDL as well

as with the counting electronics. The data in the one-photon experiments is acquired by directly measuring the photon count

rate averaged over 500 ms per data point. In the two-photon experiments, time-resolved ﬂuorescence count rate traces for the

entire sequence duration of 1 µs have been recorded with a total integration time of 200 s per trace. The population of the

upper ground state then is extracted from the rising edge of the ﬂuorescence signal of the readout pulse.
