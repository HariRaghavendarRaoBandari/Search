ABSTRACT

Based on data aquired in 13 orbits of HST time, we present a detailed evolutionary history of the M31
dSph satellite Andromeda XVI, including its life-time star formation history, the spatial distribution of
its stellar populations, and the properties of its variable stars. And XVI is characterized by prolonged
star formation activity from the oldest epochs until star formation was quenched ∼6 Gyr ago, and,
notably, only half of the mass in stars of And XVI was in place 10 Gyr ago. And XVI appears to be
a low mass galaxy for which the early quenching by either reionization or starburst feedback seems
highly unlikely, and thus, is most likely due to an environmental eﬀect (e.g., an interaction), possibly
connected to a late infall in the densest regions of the Local Group. Studying the star formation
history as a function of galactocentric radius, we detect a mild gradient in the star formation history:
the star formation activity between 6 and 8 Gyr ago is signiﬁcantly stronger in the central regions
than in the external regions, although the quenching age appears to be the same, within 1 Gyr. We
also report the discovery of 9 RR Lyrae stars, 8 of which belong to And XVI. The RR Lyrae stars
allow a new estimate of the distance, (m − M )0= 23.72±0.09 mag, which is marginally larger than
previous estimates based on the tip of the red giant branch.

Nearby resolved dwarf galaxies in the Local Group
(LG) constitute a compelling sample to address fun-
damental open questions about galaxy evolution. The
variety of properties in terms of mass, luminosity, sur-
face brightness, gas content, chemical evolution (e.g.
McConnachie 2012), together with the possibility to re-
solve them into individual stars, oﬀer a large number
of observables to investigate how small systems evolved
since their formation to the present time. In particular,
the ability to derive quantitative star formation histo-
ries (SFH) based on deep photometry reaching below the
oldest main sequence Turn-Oﬀ (TO, Gallart et al. 2005)
allows us to put ﬁrm constraints on the time of the on-
set and of the end of star formation, which opens the
possibility to constrain the physical mechanisms directly
aﬀecting the early stages of dwarf galaxy evolution. On
the one hand, it is expected that both internal (supernova
feedback, e.g., Mac Low & Ferrara 1999) and external
mechanisms (e.g., ionizing photons from the ﬁrst sources;
Ricotti & Gnedin 2005; Susa & Umemura 2004) aﬀect
the star formation activity, terminating it at an early
epoch. On the other hand, the environment is also ex-
pected to play a signiﬁcant rˆole on small systems orbiting
massive primaries (tidal stirring: Mayer et al. 2001; ram
pressure: Mayer et al. 2006; resonances: D’Onghia et al.
2009), which may have a substantial eﬀect in stripping
mass from small systems, again leading to an early ces-
sation of the star formation.

In a series of papers, based on deep HST/ACS
photometry within the framework of the LCID col-
laboration (Monelli et al. 2010a,b; Hidalgo et al. 2011;
Skillman et al. 2014), we have shown that star formation

2

generally continues well past z ∼ 6 in the mass regime
M⋆ & 106M⊙. However, during the last ten years, our
knowledge of the LG has been deeply inﬂuenced by pho-
tometric surveys that have brought about unexpected
discoveries and new questions. First, the number of
known LG galaxies has more than doubled in a few years
only. Starting with the discovery of the ﬁrst faint dwarf
(also called “ultra-faint dwarfs”, Willman et al. 2006)
the known satellites of the Milky Way (MW) jumped
from 11 (9 bright dSph plus the Magellanic Clouds) to
37 today. These faint dwarfs extend the spectrum of
galactic properties to a regime of very low mass, low lu-
minosity, and typically low mean metallicity. They are
thought to have formed stars very early on and for a
very short period of time (Brown et al. 2014), possibly
because cosmic reionization might have inhibited further
star formation in this low mass regime.

All currently known Local Group faint dwarfs ﬁt well
within this general trend, apart from one exception.
Leo T, discovered as a stellar over-density in the Sloan
Data Release 5, immediately presented a peculiar com-
low mass (∼ 105M⊙, Ryan-Weber et al.
bination of
2008) and young stellar populations (< 200 Myr,
Irwin et al. 2007), together with a large fraction of HI
gas (Ryan-Weber et al. 2008). Deeper HST data con-
ﬁrmed the extended star formation activity from the old-
est epochs to the present day (Clementini et al. 2012;
Weisz et al. 2012, see also de Jong et al. 2008), which
revives the question of whether cosmic reionization is
the actual cause of thee star formation quenching in the
faintest dwarfs. Remarkably, two more galaxies recently
discovered have stellar mass smaller than that of Leo T
but their CMD show hints of extended star formation
until intermediate epoch: Eridanus II (Koposov et al.
2015; The DES Collaboration et al. 2015) and Hydra II
(Martin et al. 2015), detected in the Dark Energy Sur-
vey and in the Survey for the MAgellanic Stellar History
footprints.

Similarly to what occurred in the MW, the number
of known satellites of M31 has increased considerably in
the last few years (Martin et al. 2009; Richardson et al.
2011; Slater et al. 2011; Bell et al. 2011; Martin et al.
2013a,b). This was mainly thanks to the eﬀort of the
PAndAS project (McConnachie et al. 2009). The discov-
ery of And XVI was reported in Ibata et al. (2007), from
MegaCam/CFHT observations of the M31 surround-
ings that later would be folded in the PAndAS survey
(McConnachie et al. 2009). And XVI is located ∼ 279
kpc from M31 in the south-east direction. The initial es-
timate of its luminosity (MV = -9.2 mag, Ibata et al.
2007) suggested a relatively bright object. However,
more recent estimates (Martin et al. 2016, submitted)
revised this value to a signiﬁcantly fainter value, MV = –
7.6 mag. First estimates based on the tip of the red giant
branch (RGB) indicated a distance (m−M )0=23.60±0.2
mag, corresponding to 525±50 kpc, though smaller val-
ues have been suggested (23.39+0.19
−0.14, Conn et al. 2012).
Spectroscopic follow-up supports a low mean metallicity,
close to [Fe/H] = –2 (Letarte et al. 2009; Collins et al.
2014, 2015). However, the most distinctive characteris-
tic of And XVI is its extended SFH, which continued to
∼6 Gyr ago (Weisz et al. 2014). The present work is part
of the ISLAND project (Initial Star-formation and Lives

of the ANDromeda Satellites), which obtained a total of
111 HST orbits to study six satellites of M31 (GO 13028,
13739): And I, And II, And III, And XV, And XVI, and
And XXVIII. In this paper we present a detailed reanal-
ysis of the data from Weisz et al. (2014), adding infor-
mation on the properties of the variable stars population
and on the spatial variation of the stellar populations.
In particular, §2 presents a brief summary of the ACS
data used in this work and a detailed presentation of
the And XVI CMD. In §3 we present the discovery and
analysis of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars, and we derive a new
distance for And XVI in §4. §5 is devoted to the deriva-
tion of the detailed SFH, while §6 presents an analysis of
the variation of the properties of And XVI as a function
of radius, both in terms of SFH and CMD morphology.
The discussion of these results (§7) and a summary of
the conclusions (§8) close the paper.

2. DATA

The data set used here is the same presented in
Weisz et al. (2014), and consists of 13 ACS images in
each the F 475W and F 814W passbands. Parallel photo-
metric reductions were conducted using both DOLPHOT
and DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME as was done for the LCID
project (e.g., Monelli et al. 2010b). Here we have chosen
to use the DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME photometry as a
matter of convenience. The calibration to the standard
VEGAMAG system was done adopting the updated zero
point from the instrument web page. Figure 1 shows a
stacked drizzled image, where a large number of back-
ground extended objects is evident. In particular, note
the edge-on galaxy apparently interacting with the big
elliptical to the West, and the group of late-type galax-
ies in the North-East. The two ellipses correspond to

§6 to investigate the radial properties. Figure 2 shows
the spatial distribution of the sources in the ﬁnal cat-
alog. Big colored symbols mark the position of the 9
discovered RRL stars (see §3.1).

2.1. CMD analysis

Figure 3 shows the (F 475W − F 814W , F 814W ) CMD
of And XVI. In the construction of Figure 3 we adopted a
reddening of E(B-V )=0.06 (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011)
and a distance modulus of (m − M )0 = 23.72 mag. The
latter value has been derived from the RRL stars, as
detailed in §4.1. The RRLs discovered in And XVI are
plotted as large symbols and will be discussed in §3.

A photometric selection was applied according to the
sharpness parameter provided by DAOPHOT (|sharp| <
0.3). Given the small number of And XVI stars, and the
heavy contamination from background galaxies, we per-
formed a further check on the stacked image, removing
a few hundred sources associated with extended objects
and spikes of heavily saturated ﬁeld stars. Finally, we
ended up retaining 5,714 bona-ﬁde stellar sources within
the 5.0′ellipse. These are shown in the CMD of the left
panel, where the typical features of a predominantly old
stellar populations clearly appear. The red giant branch
(RGB) spans more than ﬁve magnitudes, from the tip at
F 814W ≈ 20 mag down to F 814W ≈ 25.5. The hor-
izontal branch (HB) has a predominantly red morphol-
ogy with a well populated red part, concentrated close to
(F 475W − F 814W , F 814W ) ∼ (1.2, 23.5) mag, which is
well separated from the RGB, suggesting a limited metal-
licity spread. On the other extreme, the HB extends to
the blue reaching well beyond the RRL instability strip

stars is shown: red triangles mark the three RRab type, while blue

HB morphology index= −0.6418.

The central panel of the same ﬁgure shows the com-
parison with selected isochrones from the BaSTI19 stellar
evolution library (Pietrinferni et al. 2004, 2009). In par-
ticular, the red and green lines represent an old (13 Gyr,
Z=0.0001) and an not-too-old-age (6 Gyr, Z=0.0003,
Castellani & degl’Innocenti 1995) population. These two
isochrones bracket both the RGB and the main sequence
Turn-Oﬀ region well.
Interestingly, this suggests that
the stellar populations in And XVI are characterized by
a considerable age spread, but a small range of metallic-

total number of RR Lyrae stars.

ities.

Finally, the right panel presents the sources detected
in the outermost region of the ﬁeld of view, for re > 5′.
The same old isochone as in the central panel is shown.
Roughly 400 sources are present in this diagram, but no
obvious features appear. Many of the detected objects
present colors redder than the MS stars of And XVI,
suggesting that they are unresolved background galaxies.
Neverthless, we cannot rule out the possibility that some
And XVI stars are still present in this region, which will
be anyway excluded from the SFH analysis.

2.2. Blue Straggler stars

The CMD clearly show a plume of objects bluer and
brighter than the old MSTO, between F 814W ∼ 25.5
mag and F 814W ∼ 27.5 mag. They are most likely

stars, as commonly found in many dSph (Mapelli et al.
2007, 2009; Monelli et al. 2012; Santana et al. 2013). On
the other hand, stars in that region of the CMD might
be genuine young objects, with ages in the range be-
tween ∼1 and ∼ 3 Gyr. The blue line in Figure 3 repre-
sents a metal-poor isochrone of 2.5 Gyr, which provides a
fair agreement with the observed sequence. If And XVI
hosted such a young population, one would expect to
ﬁnd it spatially concentrated in the innermost region of
the galaxy, as commonly observed in LG dwarfs. Figure
4 shows the cumulative distribution of stars in the blue
plume, the RGB and the HB. Within the error, they are
identical a a function lf elliptical radius. This indirectly
supports the inference that the stars in the blue plume
are BSSs and not a young population. The plume of blue
objects causes a minor peak in the SFH between 2 and
3 Gyr ago §5.2, which contributed with ∼3% of the stel-
lar mass. Both the age range and the mass percentage
are consistent with those estimated in Cetus and Tucana
(Monelli et al. 2012). This again indirectly supports the
BSS hypothesis.

3. VARIABLE STARS

Our observational strategy was designed for optimal
time sampling of short period (.1 d) variable stars such
as RRL and Anomalous Cepheids (ACs). All the ob-

servations were executed within ∼2.1 days, and were or-
ganized in six visits, ﬁve of two and one of three or-
bits. Moreover, each orbit was split into one F 475W and
one F 814W exposure, and a sequence F 475W -F 814W -
F 814W -F 475W was observed in each group of two vis-
its. This allowed a larger time diﬀerence between the
two images at shorter wavelength, where the amplitude
is larger. Table 1 reports the observation log, listing the
image name, ﬁlter, exposure time, starting date of obser-
vation and modiﬁed Julian date at mid exposure.

3.1. RR Lyrae stars

Candidate variable stars were identiﬁed following the
same approach adopted for the galaxies of the LCID
project (Bernard et al. 2009, 2010, 2013).
In particu-
lar, we used the variability index introduced by Stetson
(1996). The light curves of selected candidates were in-
dividually visually inspected, and nine variables were
conﬁrmed. Given their pulsational properties and the
location on the CMD, we classify all of them as RRL
stars. The F 475W and F 814W magnitudes were re-
calibrated to the Johnson BV I system using the same
relations adopted in Bernard et al. (2009). Table 2 sum-
marizes the properties of the conﬁrmed variables which
are named in order of increasing right ascension. Their
position in the CMD is shown in Figure 3: red trian-
gles and blue circles represent RRab and RRc type stars,
respectively.
Interestingly, one variable (V0) is signiﬁ-
cantly fainter (green plus), by ∼0.8 mag in the F 814W
band. Figure 5 presents the light curves of the nine
variables. Despite the small number of phase points,
the time sampling chosen when preparing the observa-
tions provides a fairly homogeneous coverage of the light
curves. In particular, we do not ﬁnd any obvious prob-
lem with V0 that may account for the fainter magni-
tude, though the light curve is admittedly noisy. We
have checked whether a signiﬁcantly higher metal content
may be responsible for such a lower luminosity. Adopting
the luminosity-metallicity relation by Clementini et al.
(2003), we derive that an [Fe/H] approximately solar is
required to explain such a large magnitude diﬀerence.
Such a large metallicity spread within the population of
stars able to form RRL in And XVI looks unlikely, in par-
ticular if we take into account the relatively small range
estimated both spectroscopically (Letarte et al. 2009;
Tollerud et al. 2012) and with the SFH (see §5.2). Alter-
natively, we can assume that V0 does not belong to And
XVI, and the magnitude diﬀerence is due to a distance

the sake of clarity, F 814W was shifted by -0.6 mag to avoid overlap. Open points are excluded from the LC ﬁt due to large photometric

eﬀect. Assuming a metal content of [Fe/H]=−1.9 and
the metallicity-luminosity relation from Clementini et al.
(2003, see $ 4.1), we derive a distance diﬀerence between
V0 and the rest of variables of the order of ∼290 kpc.
Given that And XVI is located ∼200 kpc closer than
M31, this means that V0 is compatible with being lo-
cated ≈ 100 Kpc beyond M31, but still well within its
virial radius, thus being a possible candidate M31 halo
star (Ibata et al. 2014).

Figure 6 shows the period-amplitude (Bailey) diagram
for the detected variable stars. The dotted and dashed
lines mark the loci of Oosterhoﬀ I and Oosterhoﬀ II glob-
ular clusters, respectively, from Cacciari et al. (2005).
The solid line is the locus deﬁned for RRc stars, from
Kunder et al. (2013). The three And XVI RRab stars oc-
cupy the region intermediate to the two curves. However,
both the mean period of RRab stars (< Pab >=0.636
d) and of the RRc type (< Pc >=0.357 d) are close
to the typical values for the Oosterhoﬀ II type stellar
systems. Note that the ratio between the number of
RRc and RRab is unusually large (Catelan 2009), and

And XVI is the only dwarf known with more RRc than
RRab. This ﬁnding is particularly intriguing given the
red morphology of the HB which would favor the sam-
pling of the red part of the instability strip, where the
RRab are located. However it might be possibly related
to the small total number of RRL stars. Alternatively,
this eﬀect could be related to the low metallicity of the
oldest stars, such as the RR Lyrae stars which would be
preferentially located in the blue part of the HB. How-
ever, we note that other M31 satellites with similar small
number of RRL variables and bluer HB morphology such
as And XI and And XIII (Yang & Sarajedini 2012), the
number of RRab type is larger than that of RRc type (10
vs 5 and 8 vs 1, respectively).

3.2. Anomalous Cepheids

We report that we did not discover any AC in the sur-
veyed area of And XVI. This kind of pulsating variables,
present only in metal-poor (Z<0.0006 Fiorentino et al.
2006) populations, are centrally He-burning stars typi-
cally ∼1 mag brighter then RRL stars. They can form

through two diﬀerent channels:
i) single, evolved stars
of mass 1.3 . M . 2.2 M⊙, therefore younger than ∼1
Gyr; ii) coalescent binary stars evolved after the BSS
phase. Despite the fact that ACs have been observed in
many dSph galaxies (Sculptor: Kaluzny et al. 1995; For-
nax: Bersier & Wood 2002; Carina: Dall’Ora et al. 2003;
Coppola et al. 2013, Draco: Kinemuchi et al. 2008; Ce-
tus and Tucana: Bernard et al. 2009), the non-detection
in And XVI is not surprising, and we ascribe it to its
low mass. First, the lack of ACs agrees with the lack of
recent star formation, thus excluding the ﬁrst formation
channel. Second, the small number of stars populating
the blue plume of BSS (∼ 230) implies that very few
evolved stars of this population are expected. These,
due to their mass, tend to occupy the red part of the
HB, at temperatures lower than the instability strip, and
few such stars are clearly visible above the red HB, at
F 814W ∼23 mag. Finally, adopting the relation be-
tween the frequency of ACs and the luminosity of the
host galaxy, discovered by Mateo et al. (1995) and up-
dated by Fiorentino & Monelli (2012), we estimate that
1±1 ACs are expected in the surveyed area, in agreement
with the current observations.

4. DISTANCE ESTIMATE

4.1. RR Lyrae distance estimate

Pulsational properties of RRL stars can be used to
derive a robust estimate of the distance. In the following
we will use three diﬀerent methods. In the analysis, we
did not include the faint V0 RRL star.

a) First, we adopt the relation between the intrinsic
luminosity, MV , and the metallicity. In the range below
[Fe/H] = –1.6 we assume two linear relations20:

MV (RR) = 0.866(±0.085) + 0.214(±0.047)[Fe/H]

(1)

20 the F 475W and F 814W magnitudes were re-calibrated to
the Johnson BV I system using the same relations adopted in
Bernard et al. (2009)

The evolution of And XVI

from Clementini et al. (2003) and

MV (RR) = 0.72(±0.07) + 0.18(±0.07)[Fe/H]

(2)

from Bono et al. (2003). We assume a value for the
[Fe/H]=−2,
in agreement with the available spectro-
scopic measurements (Letarte et al. 2009; Collins et al.
2014, 2015). For the metal content, the Clementini et al.
(2003) and the Bono et al. (2003) relations provide ab-
solute magnitude values of MV = 0.438 and 0.360 mag,
respectively. We derive absolute distance moduli for And
XVI, corrected for extinction, of (m−M )0 = 23.72±0.09
mag and 23.79±0.08 mag, respectively, corresponding to
554 and 572 kpc. We note that a change in the metal con-
tent by 0.2 dex aﬀects the distance estimates by ∼0.04
mag
b)

is well established that RRL stars obey
a period-luminosity-metallicity relation in the near-
infrared, which can be expressed in the form

It

M ag = a + b[F e/H] + cLogP

(3)

We adopt here the most updated theoretical relations
(2015), both for the Wesenheit

from Marconi et al.
W(I,B − I) and W(I,V − I) magnitudes.

We used here the full sample of RRL stars after fun-
damentalizing the RRc type by adding 0.127 to the log-
arithm of their period. We calculated the Wesenheit ap-
parent magnitudes of each star, and adopting these re-
lations we derived the true distance modulus. Assuming
[Fe/H] ∼ -2.3 dex (Z ∼ 0.0001) the two relations provide
(m−M )0 = 23.74±0.03 mag and (m−M )0 = 23.77±0.06
mag, respectively. A slightly larger metallicity, [Fe/H] ∼
-1.8 dex (Z ∼ 0.0003) shortens the derived distance by
few hundredths of magnitude: (m − M )0 = 23.68±0.03
mag and (m − M )0 = 23.70±0.03 mag.

c) An independent method to derive the distance based
on the RRL properties was introduced by Caputo et al.
(2000) and takes advantage of the period-luminosity-
metallicity relation at the ﬁrst overtone blue edge of the
instability strip. Ideally, this method works well if the
blue side of the instability strip is well sampled, which
is not the case for the current data set. However, the
few RRc type stars found can provide an upper limit to
the distance. Applying the relations from Caputo et al.
(2000) to the shortest period star, we derive a distance
modulus of 23.83±0.07, again assuming [Fe/H]=−2.

Overall, these diﬀerent methods applied to the RRL
stars sample of And XVI provide consistent results about
its distance. For consistency with previous analysis
of isolated galaxies within the framework of the LCID
project, we will adopt the distance derived with the MV -
[Fe/H] relation by Clementini et al. (2003), (m − M )0=
23.72±0.09 mag, to derive the SFH in §5.

4.2. RGB tip distance estimate

Ibata et al. (2007) estimated the distance of And XVI
to be (m-M)0 = 23.6±0.2 mag (525 Kpc), based on the
position of the tip of the RGB. A more recent study by
Conn et al. (2012), based on a more sophisticated anal-
ysis of the same feature, suggested a slightly shorter dis-
tance, (m-M)0 = 23.39+0.19
−0.14 (476 kpc). We note that the
distance estimate based on the RRL stars are system-
atically larger than those based on the tip of the RGB.

isochrones are also over-plotted: Z=0.0001, t=13 Gyr (red line),
Z=0.001, t=6yr (blue line). We assumed (m − M )0 = 23.72 mag
and E(B-V) = 0.06 mag. Right - Luminosity function of RGB
stars. The three arrows mark the expected position of the RGB
bump for three isochrones of 10 Gyr: Z=0.0001, Z=0.0006, and
Z=0.001.

However, they are is still in agreement, within the er-
ror bars, with the value provided by Ibata et al. (2007),
and only in marginal agreement at the 2σ level with the
measurement by Conn et al. (2012) .

Figure 7 summarizes our attempt to derive a distance
to And XVI based on tip of the RGB as detected in the
ACS data. The left panel shows a zoom of the CMD in
the RGB region, and the right one presents the luminos-
ity function of RGB stars in the F 814W band. These are
highlighted by big asterisks in the left panel. The plot
clearly shows that the region of the RGB tip is heav-
ily under-sampled, with only 9 stars detected in the half
brightest magnitude. This is far from the at least 50 stars
recommended by Madore & Freedman (1995) to derive
a distance modulus with 0.1 uncertainty. This is also
supported by the comparison with theoretical isochrones
(red line: Z=0.0001, t=13 Gyr; blue: Z=0.001, t=6 Gyr).
Assuming (m-M)0=23.72 mag (from the RRL estimate,
see §4.1), it is evident that the brightest portion of the
RGB is devoid of observed stars. Note that a shorter dis-
tance modulus would move the isochrones to brighter ap-
parent magnitudes, thus worsening the problem. Given
the little contamination from both And XVI AGB and
foreground ﬁeld stars, we can set an upper limit to the
distance, assuming that the brightest observed star is
representative of the tip. This has magnitude F 814W
= 20.116 mag. The F814W absolute magnitude of the
RGB tip shows a mild dependence on the metallicity in
the metal regime appropriate for the stars in And XVI.

Fig. 8.— CMD of And XVI with superimposed the ﬁve regions

(bundles) used to derive the SFH. See text for details.

In more detail, theoretical predictions based on BaSTI
stellar models show that M tip
F 814W is equal to -4.087 at
Z=0.0001 and to -4.166 for Z=0.001. When combining
these model predictions with an extinction estimate of
AF 814W = 0.11 mag, we obtain a distance modulus up-
per limit ranging from 24.09 to 24.17 mag, i.e., in the
range 657 - 682 Kpc. A visual inspection of the CMD
from Ibata et al. (2007) discloses at least one very bright
star is missing in our photometry, possibly because it is
outside our ﬁeld of view. This is probably what causes
the diﬀerence in the derived distance using the same ap-
proach. In any case, it is evident that the poor statistics
in the RGB star counts are strongly hampering the pos-
sibility to use the RGB tip method for a robust distance
estimate.

In passing, we note that for the same reason no clear
detection of the RGB bump is possible. The luminosity
function in the right panel of Figure 7 does not show any
clear evidence of the RGB bump. The three overplotted
arrows mark the position of the RGB bump derived from
theoretical isochrones of 10 Gyr, and metallicity ranging
from Z=0.0001 to Z=0.001. We note that an observed
peak around F 814W ∼22.5 mag agrees well with the
predicted bump for Z=0.0006 and age of 10 Gyr. As the
bump positions depends both on the age (fainter bump
for increasing age) and the metallicity (fainter bump for
increasing metallicity) there is some degree of degener-
acy. However, it seems clear that the observed peak can-
not be reproduced with very metal-poor populations, as
the predicted bump for Z=0.0001 and an age of 10 Gyr is
too bright (F 814W ∼22.35 mag), and gets brighter for
decreasing age, while it gets virtually undetectable for
older ages, as the magnitude extension of the loop drops.
Similarly, in the case of more metal-rich populations, the
predicted bump is too faint, and an age of 6 Gyr is re-
quired ﬁt the observed peak (though with a color that is
too red).

Fig. 9.— SFH of And XVI. As a function of look-back time, from top to bottom the three panels show the star formation rate, the

age-metallicity relation, and the cumulative SFH. Clearly, And XVI was able to sustain star formation for at least 6 Gyr.

The SFH was derived using the IAC-star, Min-
nIAC and IAC-pop codes (Aparicio & Gallart 2004;
Hidalgo et al. 2011; Aparicio & Hidalgo 2009), in a sim-
ilar fashion as already presented in previous papers of
the LCID project (Monelli et al. 2010a,b; Hidalgo et al.
2011; Skillman et al. 2014). For the present data set, we
used a model CMD of 3×106 stars with ages and metal-
licities uniformly distributed in the ranges 0 < t < 13.5
Gyr and 0.0001 < Z < 0.0025. Observational errors were
simulated taking into account the results of 2×106 arti-
ﬁcial stars.

IAC-star requires the selection of a number of parame-
ters that are used in the solution derivation. On the one
hand, parameters used to build the model CMD such as
the amount of binary stars and the initial mass function
were chosen to be the same as in previous LCID papers.
Namely, we used a 40% binary faction (q >0.5) and the
Kroupa (2002) IMF (x=1.3 for M < M⊙ and x=2.3 for
0.5 < M⊙ < 100). To run IAC-pop and MinnIAC, deci-
sions have to be taken concerning the parametrization of
both the age and metallicity bins (that deﬁne the “sim-
ple stellar populations”) and that of the CMDs. The
adopted age and metallicity bins were:
age=[0 1 2.5:1:13.5] Gyr

metallicity=[0.0001 0.0003 0.0005 0.0007 0.0010 0.0015
0.0020 0.0025]
The sampling of the CMD is based on macro-regions,
called bundles (see Figure 8). In each bundle, stars are
counted in a regular grid of boxes, whose size is ﬁxed
and constant. The main limit of the current data set
is the relatively small number of stars in the observed
CMD, which can introduce noise in the solution if too
ﬁne of a sampling of the CMD is adopted. Therefore, we
performed a number of tests to optimize the bundle and
boxe sizes. We found that the ﬁnal solution is mostly af-
fected by two factors: i) the sizes of the boxes in bundle
1; ii) the inclusion of the RGB in bundle 4.

Most of the information on the age of the stellar pop-
ulation comes from the main sequence and TO region.
For predominantly old populations as those present in
And XVI, most of the information will come from bun-
dle 1. Bundle 3 and bundle 5 are useful to set limits
to the youngest populations and the highest metallic-
ity, respectively, while bundle 2 samples the blue plume.
In previous works, in order to give more weight to the
TO region, we adopt smaller boxes in the correspond-
ing bundle. However, we found that, in comparison with
our previous LCID experience, we had to signiﬁcantly
increase the size of individual boxes in this bundle in or-

der to avoid ﬂuctuations and the appearance of spurious
populations in the solution. Namely, the box size chosen
is (color, magnitude) = (0.04, 0.2) mag, compared to typ-
ically (0.02, 0.1) in LCID. Given the little or negligible
number of stars, larger boxes are used in bundles 2, 3 and
5. The HB is excluded from the SFH analysis because
the details of its morphology depend on highly unknown
factors such as the mass loss during the RGB phase, and
they are not properly modeled in our synthetic CMD.

The second major diﬀerence with the LCID strategy
is that including the RGB signiﬁcantly improves the so-
lution as well. With the LCID galaxies we had demon-
strated that, whenever the CMDs are well populated by
at least tens of thousands of stars, the inclusion of the
RGB has little, if any, eﬀect on the ﬁnal solution, and
typically the χ2 increases (Bernard et al. 2012). This is
mostly due to the fact that the age is highly degenerate
in the RGB, while a bundle such as the current bundle
5 is always useful to set a constraint to the most metal-
rich population. In the current analysis, where only few
thousand stars are available, we found that the solution
strongly beneﬁts from the inclusion of a bundle on the
RGB. The main eﬀect is that spurious populations (such
as simultaneously very old and very metal-rich ones) dis-
appear from the solution.

5.2. Global star formation history of And XVI

The SFH of And XVI was derived using only stars
within 5 rh from the center. The total number of stars
used to derive the SFH are 3985, 202, and 491, in bundles
1,2, 4 respectively. For larger galactocentric distances,
the majority of sources are expected to be background
unresolved galaxies, Nevertheless, the comparison with
theoretical isochrones in Figure 3 suggests that a small
fraction of And XVI stars may be present at larger ra-
dius. Scaling the number of objects in the outer regions
found in the same bundles within 5rh, we ﬁnd that an
upper limit of ∼4.5% of contaminating objects may be
aﬀecting the star counts, thus not strongly aﬀecting the
derived SFH. In particular, since the distribution of the
contaminating galaxies in the CMD does not resemble

that of a stellar population, we do not expect that they
originate any strong features at a speciﬁc age in the SFH.
The ﬁnal solution is presented in Figure 9. The three
panels represent, from top to bottom, the star formation
rate (SFR), the age-metallicity relation (AMR) and the
cumulative SFH as a function of the look-back time. And
XVI is populated by both old and intermediate age stars.
It started forming stars at the oldest possible epoch. Re-
markably, in our SFH solutions, there appears to be a sig-
niﬁcant very old peak at 13.5 Gy ago, followed by a sud-
den drop of star formation. After a minimum occurred
12 Gyr ago, star formation increased again and reached
its peak ∼10 Gyr ago. This is an extremely interesting
ﬁnding, as this feature is not common either among the
MW dSph satellites, nor the isolated ones such as Cetus
and Tucana.
In fact, they typically present one single
dominant event of star formation occurred at the old-
est epochs (see e.g., Monelli et al. 2010b,c; de Boer et al.
2012b,a). The second distinctive feature we recover, as
already found by Weisz et al. (2014),
is that the star
formation activity extends for many Gyr, vanishing 6
Gyr ago. The blue plume of stars in bundle 2 produces
the small peak at ∼3 Gyr, which we interpret as BSS
stars (see $ 2.2). We also recover a fundamentally con-
stant AMR, with metallicity not exceeding [M/H]=−1.5
(Z=0.0006), in agreement with the qualitative compari-
son with theoretical isochrones. further constrain the na-
ture cumulative SFH reveals that 10% of And XVI stellar
mass was in place by z ∼6 (∼12.8 Gyr ago), that is when
the reionization epoch concluded, and that And XVI
formed 50% of its stellar mass by z ≈2, or ∼10.1±0.2
Gyr ago (see Table 3 for the derived integrated and mean
quantities).

The Figure presents both the SFR as a function of time
(top panel) as well as the normalized cumulative SFH
(bottom). The plots disclose a general very good agree-
ment. In particular, the three solutions conﬁrm the fun-
damental results that the star formation in And XVI did
extend to ∼ 6 Gyr ago, and that there is no dominant ini-
tial event as in other dSph such as Cetus and Tucana. We
exclude that this can be an artifact due to photometric
errors, as they are too small to aﬀect the TO morphology
causing the age spread, in either photometry. Moreover,
the three solutions conﬁrm an initial star formation fol-
lowed by a less intense activity.

the closer to the center of the galaxy.

of either photometry set together with the BaSTI mod-
els provide a minimum at 12 Gyr, while the subsequent
maximum is 1 Gyr younger in the DOLPHOT+BaSTI
solution than in the DAOPHOT+BaSTI one. Interest-
ingly, while the BaSTI solution provides a strong peak
at such ages, the solution based on the Girardi library
is characterized by a ﬂatter SFR, though the age of the
peaks agrees very well with the BaSTI solutions. The
consistency between the three solutions is clear in the
bottom panels, where the cumulative SFHs agree at the
1-σ level.

6. RADIAL SPATIAL GRADIENT

In this section we investigate how the properties of
And XVI change as a function of the distance from its
center. First, we note that we do not have a symmetric
spatial sampling of the galaxy. In fact, due to a bright
ﬁeld star next to the innermost regions of And XVI, we
were forced to point the telescope such that the center
of the galaxy is next to the edge of the ACS camera, at
(X,Y)≈(566,1847) px (see the black cross in Figure 2).
Second, we estimate that the current ACS data cover
≈23% of the galaxy area.

For the following analysis, we take advantage of a ho-
mogeneous derivation of the structural parameters of
all M31 dwarf spheroidal galaxies that fall in the PAn-
dAS footprint (Salomon et al. 2015) and use the fol-
lowing, updated values for the centroid (0:59:30.3+-
0.4;+32:22:34+-0.4), ellipticity (0.29±0.08), position an-
gle (98±9◦), and half-density radius (1.0±0.1′).We calcu-
lated the elliptical distance for each star from the galaxy
center, and we used it to select three regions. The two
panels of Fig. 11 show the CMD of the inner and outer
regions, selected such that they have a similar total num-
ber of sources in the bundles used for the SFH derivation
(∼2,300). This occurs at r=1.38rh.
Interestingly, the
overall morphology of the CMD does not change strongly
as a function of radius. In the following we analyze in
detail the diﬀerences in the SFH, and how these reﬂect
in the variation of the CMD morphology. The CDM of
the outer regions, already presented in the right panel
of Figure 3, clearly demonstrates that there is marginal
evidence for the presence of And XVI stars beyond 5rh
(re=5.0′).

6.1. The spatially and temporally extended SFH of

And XVI

To guide the eye, we over-plotted on Figure 11 two
isochrones from the BaSTI database, assuming Z=0.0003
and ages= 6,8 Gyr. Comparing the two panels we found
that the region between two curves is slightly more pop-
ulated in the inner (276 stars) than in the outer region
(191 stars), suggesting that the star formation rate ∼6
Gyr ago was higher in the inner than in the outer re-
gion. It also may indicate that the star formation was
slightly more prolonged toward the center of And XVI,
as commonly found in nearby dwarf galaxies, though the
eﬀect looks small. It is remarkable that And XVI was
able to sustain star formation for at least 6 Gyr over a
vast fraction of its main body.

To support this ﬁnding, we derive the SFH in the two
elliptical regions, in identical way as for the full galaxy.
The results are shown in Figure 12, where the calculated
SFRs vs time are over-plotted. The ﬁgure shows that the
main features are consistent in the inner, outer, and the
global solutions. The SFR in both the central and exter-
nal region presents an initial peak followed by a decreased
activity. The main peak is recovered at similar age (∼10
Gyr ago), and star formation continues to 6 Gyr in both
regions. However, at the most recent epochs, it presents
stronger activity in the central part compared to the out-
skirts, with a secondary peak occurred ∼7 Gyr ago. It
must be stressed that the uncertainties are large, mostly
due to the small number of stars used to derive both solu-
tions, and therefore such detailed comparison should be

12

Monelli et al.

treated cautiously. However, the fact that And XVI was
able to sustain star formation for at least 6 Gyr over its
entire body remains a solid result. This is signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from what was found in other dwarfs. For ex-
ample, the spatial variation of the SFH in LGS 3 and
Phoenix (Hidalgo et al. 2013) indicate the presence of a
gradient in the age of the youngest populations, which
are conﬁned in the central regions only. Similar con-
clusions have been reached also in the case of the MW
satellites Fornax and Carina (de Boer et al. 2013, 2014),
which are dominated by intermediate-age populations in
the center and by purely old populations in the outskirts.

7. DISCUSSION

Given its size and luminosity, And XVI is somewhat at
the boundary between classical and faint dwarfs. Figure
13 shows the absolute MV magnitude of Local Group
dwarfs as a function of their size (half light radius, rh)
and metallicity. The data are from the compilation paper
by McConnachie (2012), and the plots partially replicate
his ﬁgures 6 and 12 (see also Clementini et al. 2012, their
ﬁgure 1). Diﬀerent symbols indicate LG dwarf galaxies
of diﬀerent morphological types, as labeled. We updated
here the position of And XVI, shown as a black diamond,
using the luminosity from Martin et al 2016 (submitted).
And XVI occupies the faint tail of the M31 satellites
sequence, being ∼1 mag brighter than M31 dwarfs of
similar size, such as And XI and And XX. With respect
to previous estimates (Ibata et al. 2007), the absolute
MV magnitude increased by ∼1.7 mag, moving And XVI
signiﬁcantly closer to the faint dwarfs region (MV = −7.5
mag), but nonetheless it is still ∼2-3 mag brighter than
Galactic faint dwarfs of similar size such as Leo V and
Ursa Major II.

And XVI is thus a small mass satellite of M31, located
relatively far from both its host (∼279 kpc) and the MW
(∼575 kpc). The most striking feature of its evolution
is that it was able to sustain star formation for ∼7 Gyr
and, as proven in the previous section, over most of its
body, with only a small spatial gradient in the sense that
the youngest star formation (6-8 Gyr ago) was stronger
in the inner regions. This occurrence is an interesting
and peculiar feature among LG dwarfs. In fact, broadly
speaking, it is something intermediate between the two
typical observed behaviors. Following the nomencla-
ture introduced by Gallart et al. (2015), we identify that
the majority of dSph galaxies are fast systems,
i.e.,
they have formed stars for a short amount of time at
the oldest epochs (e.g., Draco, Ursa Minor, Cetus, Tu-
cana). On the other extreme, slow dwarf galaxies which
present current or recent star formation are character-
ized by continuous activity from the oldest to youngest
epochs (e.g., Leo A: Cole et al. 2007; Leo T: Weisz et al.
2012; Clementini et al. 2012; DDO210: Cole et al. 2014;
the Fornax dSph: de Boer et al. 2012a; del Pino et al.
2013; the Magellanic Clouds: Smecker-Hane et al. 2002;
No¨el et al. 2009; Meschin et al. 2014). Within this
scheme, the dominant old peak of star formation makes
And XVI similar to a fast system, but nonetheless the
extended activity is typical of slow galaxies, though the
quenching occurred ∼ 6 Gyr ago. What mechanisms in-
ﬂuenced the evolution of And XVI? What favored the
extended star formation, and what caused its termina-
tion?

We derived that the mass formed in the surveyed area
during the ﬁrst two Gyr is of the order of ≈ 3 × 104M⊙
(15% of the total mass). Therefore, And XVI would
have properties comparable to a typical faint dwarf, if
star formation had been truncated at a similar epoch.
This suggests that, despite the similar stellar mass back
then, And XVI was not strongly aﬀected by reionitazion,
which is thought to be the strongest mechanism shutting
down star formation in low mass Milky Way satellites
(Brown et al. 2014). On the other hand, the proper-
ties of the old population in And XVI are reminiscent
of those of the old population in the low-mass dIrr iso-
lated galaxies, Leo A and Leo T, at least in terms of
integrated quantities. On the one hand, the mean star
formation rate of Leo A between 13.5 and 11.5 Gyr ago
was ∼2.×10−5M⊙yr−1, implying that this dIrr formed in
the ﬁrst 2 Gyr a mass of stars of the order of 4×104 M⊙.
This is within a factor of 2 of what was produced by And
XVI21. Moreover, the number of RRL stars is very sim-
ilar in both systems (8 vs 10, Bernard et al. 2013). On
the other hand, Figure 13 also shows that, in both planes,
And XVI is located remarkably close to Leo T, the lowest
mass star forming galaxy known in the LG. In particular,
And XVI is ∼0.5 mag fainter than Leo T which, despite
its low mass (total mass < 107M⊙, Simon & Geha 2007,
M⋆ ∼ 1.2 × 105M⊙ Ryan-Weber et al. 2008, thus compa-
rable to that of And XVI), was able to form stars over a
Hubble time (Weisz et al. 2012; Clementini et al. 2012).
This suggests that the initial properties of And XVI,
Leo A, and Leo T were similar to those of a faint dwarf
progenitor. Nonetheless, if the initial masses were sim-
ilar, And XVI, Leo T, and Leo A would have been
equally vulnerable as faint dwarfs to the quenching eﬀect
of reionization. This clearly does not seem to be the case,
since in the SFH there is no trace of a strong damping
eﬀect during the early evolution, contrary to what oc-
curs in faint dwarfs. Possibly, this is indicating that the
diﬀerent evolution is dictated by the environmental con-
ditions. At present, Leo T is located in relative isolation
quite similar to And XVI, at ∼400 kpc from the MW
and more than ∼900 kpc from M31. Interestingly, the
negative radial velocities of both Leo T and And XVI
with respect of both spirals and the LG barycenter is
compatible with them approaching the LG for the ﬁrst
time. Leo A is remarkably one of the most isolated sys-
tems at the fringes of the LG. Together with DDO210
and VV124 it belongs to the restricted group of dwarf
galaxies that did not ever strongly interact with either
the MW and M31 all along their history (McConnachie
2012). The similarity of And XVI and these dIrrs may
also indirectly support the idea that And XVI was ini-
tially located in a lower density environment, far from
both the ionizing radiation and the gravitational eﬀect of
the growing MW and M31, thus explaining the prolonged
star formation despite the initial
low mass. This has
been proposed to be generally the case for slow systems
(Gallart et al. 2015).

Moreover,

it has been suggested that And XVI is
among the least dark matter dominated of the M31 satel-

21 Taking into account the area covered by ACS data and the size
of Leo A(Vanseviˇcius et al. 2004), we estimate that this number
might be underestimated by a factor or ≈2-3, thus not aﬀecting

lites (Collins et al. 2014). This as well might be an indi-
cation of a slower mass assembling history maybe related
to the formation in a low-density environment. Although
such small systems are expected to be strongly aﬀected
by reionization, the subsequent evolution may be driven
by a complex interplay of mass assembly history, eﬀect of
the reionization and eﬀect of stellar feedback. Theoreti-
cal models by Ben´ıtez-Llambay et al. (2014) suggest that
the stellar feedback acts as regulator of the evolution of
small galaxies after the reionization epoch: in those sys-
tems where the star formation started before the reion-
ization, the stellar feedback contributes to sweep out the
gas, causing a deﬁnitive termination in the star forma-
tion. In those systems where no stars formed before the
reionization epoch, this contributes to heat up and dis-
perse the gas, but is not strong enough to permanently
remove the gas from these systems. This gas is later rec-
ollected by the central halo and can start producing stars
mostly at intermediate to young ages. Leo A, Leo T and
And XVI may ﬁt in this scheme, and therefore they may
be galaxies with mass below threshold for star formation
before the reionization.

8. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a detailed analysis of the And
XVI dSph galaxy, satellite of M31, based on deep CMD
obtained from ACS data. The main conclusions can be
summarized as follows:

• We have derived three SFH of And XVI using
two diﬀerent photometric reduction (DAOPHOT and
DOLPHOT) and two stellar evolution libraries (BaSTI
and Girardi), obtaining a very good agreement indepen-
dently on the assumptions;
• The SFH of And XVI at the oldest epochs seems dif-
ferent from both the MW and isolated dSph, as the dom-
inant peak occurred relatively late, around 10 Gyr ago,
is preceded by an initial peak at the oldest ages, followed
by a period of decreased activity;
• Despite the low stellar mass (M∼105M⊙), And XVI
presents an extended star formation activity, which be-
gun at the oldest epochs and was maintained until ∼6

Gyr ago;
• We detected 9 variable stars, all RRL stars. Eight of
them belong to And XVI, while one is compatible with
being a more distant, M31 halo ﬁeld star;
• We provided a new estimate of the distance of And
XVI, (m − M )0= 23.72±0.09 mag, based on the prop-
erties of RRL stars. We found that diﬀerent meth-
ods (Luminosity-metallicity relation, period-luminosity-
metallicity relation) provide values slightly larger than
previous estimates based on the RGB tip;
• We discussed the properties of And XVI in comparison
with other LG dwarfs. And XVI occupies the faint end
of the dSph sequence. However, we found that if its star
formation would have been truncated 12 Gyr ago, today
it would closely resemble a faint dwarf galaxy in stellar
mass.
• The SFH of And XVI is consistent with a formation
and early evolution in a low-density environment, which
favored a slow mass assembly and prolonged star forma-
tion. A late arrival in the inner region of the LG may
have been the cause of the termination in star formation
occurring ∼7 Gyr ago.

New data available for more M31 satellites, collected
within the framework of this project, will allow us to
build a fundamental sample to compare the MW, M31,
and isolated dwarfs in the LG.
