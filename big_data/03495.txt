Abstract—Molecular Communication as the most potential
methods to solve the communication in nano scale, for it’s derived
from nature, and it becomes more and more prevalent. Though
molecular communication happens in three dimensional situa-
tion, there are also some situation that are in the one dimensional
situation, especially when considering the transmitters and the
receivers are in extremely short distance or in long slim pipe.
In this paper, we introduce the one dimensional situation, and
studied how the continuous information molecules transmitted in
this situation, also introduced how to encode and decode the in-
formation molecules, and based on the molecular communication
model, we studied some metrics of it, such as the distance between
transmitter and receiver, the emitting frequency of transmitter.
Through the research we know that the distance and frequency
are important metrics to the successful communication, which
can direct us how to place the nano transmitters and receivers
in the future nano network environment.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the quickly development of nano technology, the scale
of electrical devices becoming smaller and smaller, and the
ability of single nano machine is very limited due to its size,
therefore, sharing information among nano machines is good
for the use of single nano machine through the connection
of them, which organise the nano network. Achieving the
communication of nano machines has two main ways which
are nano electrical communication through Carbon nanotubes
and molecular communication through information molecules.
Among them, molecular communication(MC) is the most
potential way to achieve, which relies on the bio-inspired
method and ﬁts for the biological environment.
At the open space of biological environment, the three di-
mensional space is ﬁt for molecular communication[1] to
model channel. In Mahfuz et al’s articles, they elaborated on
the spatiotemporal distribution of information messages under
the binary concentration-encoded modulate methods. Mahfuz’s
researches have a great impact on the study of molecular
communication, which gives us a new modulate methods. For
the binary concentration-encoded modulate methods, it’s much
ﬁt for the biological environment, and without considering the
inner structures of the molecules. Also in Akan’s paper, he
studied the ligand and receptor process of molecular commu-
nication, in order to study the details of how molecules bind
with the receptors, which is based on the binary concentration-
encoded modulate methods.

All of their works help us understand the molecular com-
munication clearly. As we know in molecular communication
different modulation methods or different transportation envi-
ronment can make different channel. Most studies are based on
the three dimensional environmental, and fews are concentrate
on the one dimensional environment. Comparing with the three
dimensional , one dimensional can make sure the receiver
receive all the information molecules for a long time, and
the one dimensional situation is simple enough, therefore, it
is worth for us to study it and it has a wealth of applications.
For instance, in Nariman’s molecular communication test-bed,
which is studied based on the one dimensional environment.
Also in extremely tiny pipe, the transmitter and receiver nano
machines on sides of the pipe can regard as in the same line.
Additionally, when transmitter and receiver nano machines are
in extremely small distance, we can consider they are in one
dimensional environment.
In this paper, we mainly considered in the tiny slim pipe,
how the continuous information molecules are transmitted.
And how the information transmission is affected by the
transmission frequency and the distance of transmitter and
receiver. The study can help us know how the frequency affect
the communication between nano machines. Also can help us
to place the nano machines in the future.
The paper is organised as follows: in Section II, we produced
a molecular comunication model; in Section III we introduced
the sample method and the threshold of the receiver; in Section
IV, we analyzed some parameters which affect the model; in
Section V, we make a conclusion of our work.

II. MOLECULAR COMMUNICATION VIA DIFFUSION

We model a communication system composed of a pair of
devices which are connected by an extremely slim pipe, each
called a nanonetworking-enabled node(NeN,ie., nano node or
nano robot)[2]. The communication system is described as
Fig.1. In molecular communication via diffusion(MCvD), the
NeNs communicate with each other through the propagation
of certain molecules via diffusion[3]. The TN transmits the
encoded information molecules in the propagation medium,
the communication phase being known as the sending phase.
The transmitted molecules propageated by the channel, the
bind with the RN ,which is known as the ligand-receptor

binding[4]. Since the TN and RN nano machine are connected
by the extremely slim pipe, surely, we can consider the TN
and RN in the one dimensional environment, then we can
study its spatiotemporal distribution of signal strength in one
dimensional environment.

Fig. 1. The molecular communication system

The emission of information can be an instantaneous or a
continuous emission. As the instantaneous release of informa-
tion molecules, in a single puff, would be ideal design for
communications requiring rapid fade-out. On the other hand,
the source emitting message molecules continuously at a con-
stant rate, to some extent might be useful for status telemetry,
navigational beacons or periodic sampling monitors[5]. In this
paper we regard the emission is continuous.
The spatiotemporal distribution of molecules transmitted by
the TN that will be available at RN is calculated by the well-
known Roberts equation explained in [6]. We assume that a
point source type TN continuously emitting molecules at a rate
Q(t) molecules per second, x is taken as the distance down the
pipe from the source, A is the cross-sectional area of the long
and slim pipe,and the concentration of molecules U (x, t) at
distance x and time instant t, then in one dimensional situation,
U (x, t) is described as follows Eq.1,

U (x, t) =Z t

4D(t−t⋆ ) dt⋆

t > 0.

where t⋆ as the dummy variable of integration, D is the
diffusion constant in cm2/sec.
We use the ON-OFF modulation method to transmit informa-
tion. By transmit 1 bit, the TN will emitting a quantity of
molecules Q(Q > 0), and transmit 0 bit, the TN will emitting
nothing to the channel. We utilize fb stands fot the emitting
frequency of TN, and Tb = 1/fb is the emitting period. In the
emitting period, we can emitting molecules continuously, or
transmitting nothing as described in Eq.2 or Fig.2.

Q(t) =( Qaverage;

0;

for bit ’0’

III. SAMPLE METHOD AND CONCENTRATION THRESHOLD

In this paper, we regard Q(t) as a constant value Qaverage
which is the average molecules in the emitting period. As
aforementioned we transmit ”1” when emitting a quantity of
molecules, and transmit ”0” when emitting nothing. In this
situation, the distance between TN and RN is x, as Fig.3
describes, we try to transmit bit sequences ”10110”.

Fig. 3.

spray in single duration[7]

When molecules were transmitted to the receiver(RN), the
RN needs to decide the information is ”1” or ”0. Therefore,
we need to set a threshold for the receiver, by comparing
the available information molecules(AIM) to the threshold,
we can know the information is ”1” if the AIM is great or
equal than the threshold, and in vice versa, the information
is ”0”. In the RN side, it’s no need to sample the value of
AIM for each time instant, according to the NyquistShannon
sampling theorem, we can get the sampling value at time
instant of (2n−1)Tb
is ZSD, where n is the length of the
bit information, we only need to compare the ZSD to the
threshold. In Fig.3, the red arrow is the sampling instant, and
the interference is the noise information molecules from the
previous molecules informations, in this paper, for a simple
description, we only need to consider one bit information of
the previous information molecules.

IV. ANALYSIS

In this section, we study how the distance and emitting
frequency affect the transmission under the environment of
air medium. And at last, we do the simulation to testify the
difference of information transmission in one dimensional(1-
D) situation and three dimensional(3-D) situation. In this
section, we only transmit two bit information ”10”, for it can
help us analysis the AIM in the ﬁrst bit ”1”, and interference
in the second bit ”0”.

Through the Fig.4, we ﬁnd that with the increase of distance
between TN an RN, the AIM in the RN side is become smaller
and smaller, but the interference is becoming larger and larger.
Therefore, we need to set the distance at short distance, in
order to transmit enough information molecules, and improve
the probability of successful information transmission.

B. How frequency affect the concentration

Assuming that the Qaverage is 10000 molecules/sec, the
distance between TN and RN is d = 1cm, and the diffusion
coefﬁcient in air medium is D = 0.43cm2/s. Using the model
in Eq.1, we do the simulation at different emitting frequencies,
such as 1

10 Hz, 1

20 Hz and 1

30 Hz.

Through the Fig.4, we ﬁnd that with the increase of fb, the
AIM in the RN side is become smaller and smaller, also the
interference is becoming smaller and smaller. Since the AIM
and interference increase or decrease simultaneously, we need
to make a compromise for the change of frequency, in order
to transmit enough information molecules, and improve the
probability of successful information transmission.

C. The comparison available of molecule concentration in 1-
D and 3-D

We need to do some researches to study the differences
between one dimensional situation and three dimensional
situation. We use the same basic values of the parameters
described before, except for the distance x = 0.5, the fre-
quency f = 1

transmission is adapted from [8]. The simulation result shows
in Fig.6.

Fig. 6. The comparison of molecules transmission in 1-D and 3-D medium

From Fig.6, we know that the 3-D line higher than 1-
D, and the interference is almost the same. In one dimen-
sional situation can make sure the receiver the information
molecules completely in certain time, however, the available
information in three dimensional situation is higher. We think
the reason is that in three dimensional situation, there are a
large quantities of molecules in certain time slot, but to the

one dimensional situation the information molecules needs to
transmit sequencely which result the through out is smaller.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we studied continuous molecules were trans-
mitted in one dimensional molecular communication. We use
binary concentration-encoded method to encode information
molecules into bit ”1” or ”0”, also we introduce sample
theorem and threshold for the receiver to decode information
molecules. To study the molecular communication deeper, we
studied that how the metrics of distance and frequency affect
the molecules concentration, and we learned that the longer
the distance the lower of the available information molecules
in RN, but higher in interferences, and the frequency has
two sides on the available molecular communication, either
positive or negative, therefore, we should make a compromise
between the available information molecules and the inter-
ferences from the former information bits. Finally, we made
a comparison between one dimensional situation and three
dimensional situation, and we ﬁnd that in three dimensional
situation,
the RN side has a higher available information
molecules, but cannot make sure the RN receives the molecular
information for one hundred percent.
Still there are many areas need to study, for the future research
work, we can promote our research from three aspects. For
the ﬁrst,we can study how the variation of different emit rates
affect the molecules concentration. For the second , we should
ﬁnd a method to make a cut-off between the frequency and
the interference, in order to make the communication more
accurate and high efﬁciency. For the third, we should consider
to combine the advantages of the three dimensional and one
dimensional situation to improve the available information
molecules.
