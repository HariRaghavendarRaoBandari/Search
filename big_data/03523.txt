CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR

CLASSICAL GROUPS

IAN LE

Abstract. Let S be a surface, G a simply-connected classical group, and G′ the associated
adjoint form of the group. We show that the spaces of moduli spaces of framed local systems
XG′ ,S and AG,S , which were constructed by Fock and Goncharov ([FG1]), have the structure
of cluster varieties, and thus together form a cluster ensemble. This simpliﬁes some of the
proofs in [FG1], and also allows one to quantize higher Teichmuller space following the
formalism of [FG2], [FG3], and [FG5], which was previously only possible when G had type
A.

1. Introduction

Let S be a topological surface S of with non-empty boundary, let G be a simply connected
semi-simple group, and let G′ be the adjoint form of this group. We are interested in the
space LG,S, the moduli space of G-local systems on the surface S, or, equivalently, the space of
representations of π1(S) into G. There are two closely related spaces XG′,S and AG,S, which
were constructed by Fock and Goncharov [FG1]. Both the the spaces XG′,S and AG,S are
variations on the space LG,S; they parameterize local systems with certain types of framing at
the boundary of S.
One advantage of studying the spaces XG′,S and AG,S is that they are simpler; for example,
they have rational co-ordinate charts, while LG,S does not, in general. In our view, the spaces
XG′,S and AG,S are perhaps more fundamental, and allow one to understand properties of the
space LG,S that are otherwise hard to see.
In [FG1], Fock and Goncharov show that each of the spaces XG′,S and AG,S has an atlas
of coordinate charts such that all transition functions involve only addition, multiplication and
division.
In other words, these spaces each have a positive atlas and may be called positive
varieties. The main ingredient in the construction of this positive atlas of coordinate charts is
Lusztig’s theory of total positivity. The fact that XG′,S and AG,S are positive varieties is quite
striking; it is the key result in [FG1].
For the spaces XP GLn,S and ASLn,S, Fock and Goncharov show more: these spaces have
cluster-like structures on their rings of functions, and thus the fact that they are positive
varieties is a consequence of the fact that they are cluster varieties. Moreover, the pair of
spaces (ASLn,S,XP GLn,S) are tightly connected, and form what they call a cluster ensemble.
Let us review some of the consequences of the theory. The moduli space of representations
of π1(S) into a split real group G(R) has several components, one of which is called higher
Teichmuller space, because in many ways it behaves like Teichmuller space. Because XG′,S
and AG,S are positive varieties, it makes sense to take the positive R>0 points of these moduli
spaces. The resulting spaces XG′,S(R>0) and AG,S(R>0) parameterize positive representations.
With some work, Fock and Goncharov identify positive representations with higher Teichmuller
space, thus giving it an algebro-geometric description. The theory gives an explicit parameter-
ization of positive representations, and it becomes manifest that the space of representations is
contractible. Moreover, one can show that all positive representations are discrete and faithful
[FG1], [L].

In this paper, we will construct cluster ensemble structures on XG′,S and AG,S for G a
for G of type B, C and D. In other words, we show that (AG,S,XG′,S)
classical group, i.e.
forms a cluster ensemble. In doing so, we give what we think to be a beautiful set of functions
on the spaces XG′,S and AG,S which generalizes the “canonical functions” when G = SLn. The
canonical functions for SLn have a long history, see [RR], [S], [HK], [Hen]. As in the case of
G = SLn, our functions will induce positive structures on XG′,S and AG,S, which will agree
with the positive structures deﬁned in [FG1].

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

The cluster structures on double Bruhat cells and in ﬂag varieties is well known ([BFZ]), and
they form a building block for the cluster structures on XG′,S and AG,S. The cluster structures
on XG′,S and AG,S are constructed via ideal triangulations of S. The cluster structure on each
triangle is close to the cluster structure on the Borel subgroup B for the group G. The ﬁrst
main problem is to correctly identify the cluster structure on each triangle and to understand
how these structures glue together. We were inspired in our solution to this problem by the
idea of “amalgamation” developed in [FG4].

For each triangulation of the surface S and for any ordering of the vertices in each triangle
of the triangulation, one can write down an associated seed for the cluster ensemble. (This
seed can be constructed out of a reduced word for the longest element w0 of the Weyl group
of G.) When G = SLn or P GLn these functions (for a particular choice of the reduced word
for w0) somewhat miraculously exhibit S3 symmetry. This is not the case for general groups
G. We give the sequence of mutations that relates seeds associated to diﬀerent orderings of the
vertices in a given triangle in the triangulation.

Moreover, we give a sequence of mutations relating seeds that correspond to diﬀerent trian-
gulations. This problem reduces to the problem of relating seeds coming from triangulations
that diﬀer by a “ﬂip,” which is the change of triangulation that results from replacing one
diagonal of a quadrilateral by another. When G has type A, this sequence of mutations comes
the octahedron recurrence, which has been very well-studied [RR], [S], [HK]. We will give an
analogue of the octahedron recurrence for G is a classical group.

Both the sequences of mutations realizing S3 symmetries and ﬂips of triangulations are
relatives the octahedron recurrence ([S]) and the tetrahedron recurrence (which is related to
the Jeu de Taquin operation on tableaux and the action of the cactus group on crystals [HK],
[Hen]). The computation of these sequences of mutations forms the technical heart of this
paper. This has several consequences.

somewhat simpler proofs of many of the results in [FG1].

therefore get an injection of the mapping class group into the cluster modular group
for (AG,S,XG′,S).

have Langlands dual seeds. Here G∨ is the Langlands dual group of G. This is some
manifestation of mirror symmetry, and gives support for conjectures of [GS].

(4) One observes that for classical groups, the cluster ensembles (AG,S,XG′,S) and (A(G′)∨,S,XG∨,S)

(6) Using [Le], one can deﬁne higher laminations for all classical groups.
(7) One can prove sharper versions of the saturation conjecture [Le2].

In fact, for a general reductive group, our constructions allow us to construct the cluster
ensemble structure for XG′,S and AG,S. However, in the exceptional cases, we do not know
how to realize the S3 symmetries and the ﬂip. This is the only piece of the puzzle missing that
prevents us from getting a mapping class group equivariant quantization of higher Teichmuller
space and all the associated results above.

Let us explain the structure of this paper.

In Section 2, we review some of the work of
Fock and Goncharov. We deﬁne the spaces XG′,S and AG,S and relate them to spaces of

4

IAN LE

conﬁgurations of points in G/B and G/U : Confm AG and Confm BG. We also recall the
necessary facts about cluster algebras.
In Sections 3-5, we give the cluster algebra structure on the spaces Conf m AG for G =
Sp2n, Spin2n+1, Sp2n+2. The structure of these three sections is much parallel. This is in part
so that the sections may be read independently, and in part to emphasize the similarities (and
diﬀerences) between these three diﬀerent cases. A reader only interested in one case may skip
the others. These sections each contain the construction of the seed for the cluster algebra
structure on Confm AG, as well the sequences of mutations that realize the S3 symmetries on
each triangle and the ﬂip of a triangulation. These sections form the technical heart of the
paper. We have included complete formulas in all three cases though in some of the proofs of
these formulas, we refer to previous sections if an identity we need has already been proven.
Thus in Sections 4 and 5, we emphasize those aspects of the proof of the mutation identities
which are novel.

The formulas and mutation sequences can become quite involved. We try to alleviate this
in two ways. First of all, much of the important information in our computations is succinctly
captured in the diagrams, so that one can extract most of the content of the computations from
the diagrams once one understands how to read them. Most of the general phenomena can be
seen in small cases, like Sp8, Spin9 or Spin10, which are treated in the diagrams.

Second, throughout Sections 3-5, we try to explain the conceptual underpinnings of the
calculations. This is done in several ways. We show how the cluster algebra structure is related
to reduced words in the Weyl group; we show how the cactus sequence of mutation plays a role
in constructing the seeds and computing some of the S3 symmetries; we explain how folding
the seed for SL2n gives the seed for Sp2n, how Langlands duality relates the seeds for Sp2n and
Spin2n+1, and how unfolding the seed for Spin2n+1 gives the seed for Spin2n+2. The latter
fact is perhaps most important: all the sequences of mutations that we consider arise from the
ones for Sp2n by Langlands duality or unfolding.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 6 treats the cluster-like structure
on Confm BG. Section 7 gives applications to the quantization of higher Teichmuller space.
Section 8 is an appendix containing some calculations that are parallel to ones treated in the
main body of the text, but seemed unnecessary to include.

Acknowledgments I thank Joel Kamnitzer for ﬁrst explaining to me the role that the cactus
group plays in the representation theory of SLn. The role of the cactus group and the tetrahe-
dron recurrence only slowly became clear to me in the course of writing this paper. I am also
indebted to Inna Zakharevich for showing me how to make the diagrams in this paper.

2. Background

2.1. Setup. Let S be a compact oriented surface, with or without boundary, and possibly with
a ﬁnite number of marked points on each boundary component. We will refer to this whole set
of data–the surface and the marked points on the boundary–by S. We will always take S to
be hyperbolic, meaning it either has negative Euler characteristic, or contains enough marked
points on the boundary (in other words, we can give it the structure of a hyperbolic surface
such that the boundary components that do no contain marked points are cusps, and all the
marked points are also cusps).

Let G be a semi-simple algebraic group. When G is adjoint, i.e., has trivial center (for
example, when G = P GLm), we can deﬁne a higher Teichmuller space XG,S. On the other hand,
for G simply-connected (for example, when G = SLm), we can deﬁne the higher Teichmuller
space AG,S. They will be the space of local systems of S with structure group G with some extra

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

structure of a framing of the local system at the boundary components of S. Alternatively, these
spaces describe homomorphisms of π1(S) into G modulo conjugation plus some extra data.

When S does has at least one hole, the spaces XG,S and AG,S have a distinguished collection
of coordinate systems, equivariant under the action of the mapping class group of S. Using an
elaboration of Lusztig’s work on total positivity, one can show that all the transition functions
between these coordinate systems are subtraction-free, and give a positive atlas on the corre-
sponding moduli space. This positive atlas gives the spaces XG,S and AG,S the structure of a
positive variety.
The existence of these extraordinary positive co-ordinate charts depends on G. Lusztig’s
theory of positivity in semi-simple Lie groups [Lu], [Lu2], and is a reﬂection of the cluster
algebra structure of the ring of functions on these spaces.

2.2. Deﬁnition of the spaces XG,S and AG,S. The data of a framing of a local system
involves the geometry of the ﬂag variety associated to a group. Let B be a Borel subgroup,
a maximal solvable subgroup of G. Then B = G/B is the ﬂag variety. Let U := [B, B] be a
maximal unipotent subgroup in G. Then we will call A = G/U the “principal aﬃne space”
(sometimes also referred to as the “base aﬃne space”). We will refer to elements of A as
“principal ﬂags.”
Let L be a G-local system on S. For any space X on equipped with a G-action, we can
form the associated bundle LX . For X = G/B we get the associated ﬂag bundle LB, and for
X = G/U , we get the associated principal ﬂag bundle LA.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A framed G-local system on S is a pair (L, β), where L is a G-local system
on S, and β a ﬂat section of the restriction of LB to the punctured boundary of S.

The space XG′,S is the moduli space of framed G-local systems on S.
The deﬁnition of the space AG,S is slightly more complicated.
Let G is simply-connected. The maximal length element w0 of the Weyl group of G has a
natural lift to G, denoted w0. Let sG := w2
0. It turns out that sG is in the center of G and that
s2
G = e. Depending on G, sG will have order one or order two. For example, for G = SL2k, sG
has order two, while for G = SL2k+1, sG has order one.

systems. We shall deﬁne this notion.

It involves twisted local

The fundamental group π1(S) has a natural central extension by Z/2Z. We see this as
follows. For a surface S, let T ′S be the tangent bundle with the zero-section removed. π1(T ′S)
is a central extension of π1(S) by Z:

The quotient of π1(S) by the central subgroup 2Z ⊂ Z, gives π1(S) which is a central

extension of π1(S) by Z/2Z:

Z → π1(T ′S) → π1(S).

Let σS ∈ π1(S) denote the non-trivial element of the center.
A twisted G-local system is a representation π1(S) in G such that σS maps to sG. Such a

representation gives a local system on T ′S.

Z/2Z → π1(S) → π1(S).

Now we must describe the framing data for a twisted local system. Let L be a twisted G-local
system on S. Such a twisted local system gives an associated principal aﬃne bundle LA on the
punctured tangent bundle T ′S. For any boundary component of S, we will construct sections
of the punctured tangent bundle above these boundary components. Given any boundary
component, consider the outward pointing unit tangent vectors along this component–this gives

6

IAN LE

a section of the punctured tangent bundle above each boundary component of S. We get a
bunch of loops and arcs in T ′S lie over the boundary of S. Call this the lifted boundary.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A decorated G-local system on S consists of (L, α), where L is a twisted local
system on S and α is a ﬂat section of LA restricted to the lifted boundary.
The space AG,S is the moduli space of decorated G-local systems on S.
Note that in the case where sG = e, a decorated local system is just a local system on S
along with a ﬂat section of LA restricted to the boundary. One can generally pretend that this
is the case without much danger.

2.3. Relation to conﬁgurations of ﬂags. The positive co-ordinate systems on XG′,S and
AG,S arise by rationally identiﬁng them with spaces of conﬁgurations of ﬂags. For more details,
see [FG1].
Let S be a hyperbolic surface. Give it some hyperbolic structure such that the boundary
components that do no contain marked points are cusps, and all the marked points are also
cusps. The particular choice of hyperbolic structure will turn out not to matter. Then the
universal cover of S will be a subset of the hyperbolic plane, and all these cusps will lie at
the boundary at inﬁnity of the hyperbolic plane. These cusps form a set C that has a cyclic
ordering. C also carries a natural action of π1(S). The action of π1(S) preserves the cyclic
ordering on C. The set C with its cyclic order is independent of our choice of hyperbolic
structure on C. An ideal triangulation of S consists of a triangulation of S that has vertices at
the cusps of S. An ideal triangulation of S induces an ideal triangulation of its universal cover.
This triangulation of the universal cover will have its vertices at the set C.

A π1(S)-equivariant conﬁguration of ﬂags (respectively principal aﬃne ﬂags) parameterized
by C is a map β : C → B (respectively a map β : C → A) such that there is a map ρ : π1(S) → G
such that for γ ∈ π1(S),

β(γ · c) = ρ(γ) · c

for all points c ∈ C.
Starting with any point of XG′,S (respectively AG,S), we may look at the universal cover of
S. On the universal cover, the local system becomes trivial, and the framing of the local system
then gives a ﬂag (repectively a principal aﬃne ﬂag) at each point of the cyclic set C. Thus any
point in XG′,S (respectively AG,S) gives a π1(S) equivariant conﬁguration of ﬂags (respectively
principal aﬃne ﬂags) parameterized by C.

Theorem 2.3. [FG1] The space XG′,S has a positive atlas that comes from identifying a framed
local system with a π1(S)-equivariant positive conﬁguration of ﬂags parameterized by C.
The space AG,S has a positive atlas that comes from identifying a decorated local system with
a π1(S)-equivariant twisted positive cyclic conﬁguration of principal aﬃne ﬂags parameterized
by C.

This theorem gives a birational equivalence between XG′,S (respectively AG,S) and the stack
of π1-equivariant positive conﬁgurations of ﬂags (respectively principal aﬃne ﬂags) parameter-
ized by C. This birational morphism is an isomorphism on positive points: the positive points
of XG′,S (respectively AG,S) correspond to positive representations of ρ : π1(S) → G plus dec-
oration. Any point of XG′,S(R>0) (respectively AG,S(R>0)) gives a π1(S)-equivariant positive
conﬁguration of ﬂags parameterized by C. This conﬁguration of ﬂags uniquely determines the
representation ρ as well as the decoration on the corresponding local system.

When S is a disk with marked points on the boundary we simply get moduli spaces of
conﬁgurations of points in the ﬂag variety B := G′/B and twisted conﬁgurations of points of
the principal aﬃne variety A := G/U . For more details, see [FG1]

on XG′,S and AG,S.

When S is a disc with m marked points, the spaces XG′,S and AG,S become the spaces of
conﬁgurations of points in the ﬂag variety Conf m B and conﬁgurations of points in the aﬃne
variety, Confm A. We will ﬁrst describe the positive structures on these spaces.
We start with some notation. Let U + and U − denote the upper and lower unipotent sub-
groups of G′. Also let B+ and B− denote the upper and lower Borel subgroups of G′. We can
identify points in B with Borel subgroups. If B is a Borel subgroup, we let g · B denote the
Borel subgroup gBg−1. The positive structures on these spaces are deﬁned as follows.

([FZ]), and this positive structure is preserved by conjugation. Thus (U −)n/H is a positive

The natural positive structure on H × (B−)n induces a positive structure on Confn+2(A).
(Note that w denotes a particular lift of the element w of the Weyl group to G. See [BFZ] or
[FG1]. Here, w0 denotes the longest element of the Weyl group.)

8

IAN LE

The positive structures on Conf n+2(B) and Conf n+2(A) are invariant under cyclic shift
and twisted cyclic shift, respectively. The cyclic shift on Confn(B) maps (B1, B2, . . . , Bn)
to (Bn, B1, . . . , Bn−1). The twisted cyclic shift on Conf n(A) maps (U1, U2, . . . , Un) to (sG ·
Un, U1, . . . , Un−1).

2.5. Reduction to the case of Conf m A or Confm B. We now recall the positive structures
on the spaces XG′,S and AG,S as constructed in [FG1].
In [FG1], the authors explain how to construct a positive co-ordinate chart on Confm(B) for
each triangulation of an m-gon. If we place the m ﬂags at the vertices of an m-gon, then to
each triangle in the triangulation of the m-gon, we get a conﬁguration of three ﬂags, and to this
conﬁguration of three ﬂags, we attach some face functions. The face functions give a positive
co-ordinate chart on Conf3(B). Any edge in the triangulation belongs to two triangles. We
attach to each edge a set of edge functions, which depend on the four ﬂags at the corners of the
two triangles. For any edge, its edge functions along with the face functions for the triangles
sharing that edge form a positive co-ordinate chart on Conf 4(B). Thus the face functions give
invariants of three ﬂags, while the edge functions tell us how to glue two conﬁgurations of three
ﬂags into a conﬁguration of four ﬂags. Gluing along all edges of a triangulation will give a
conﬁguration of m ﬂags.

There are also positive co-ordinate charts on Conf m(A) attached to each triangulation of
an m-gon. These are constructed slightly diﬀerently. To each edge in the triangulation, we
attach a set of edge functions which depend on the two ﬂags at the ends of the edge. To each
triangle in the triangulation, we get a conﬁguration of three principal ﬂags, and in addition to
the edge functions of each pair of edges in the triangle, we attach some face functions, which
depend on all three of the principal ﬂags (not just two at a time). Thus whereas for Conf m(B),
the edge functions give us the data for gluing conﬁgurations of three ﬂags, for Confm(A), two
conﬁgurations of three principal ﬂags can be glued along an edge only if the edge functions
along that edge are identical. Thus we exchange gluing data for restrictions on when we can
glue.

For a general surface S, we use the identiﬁcation of XG′,S (respectively AG,S) with π1-
equivariant conﬁgurations of ﬂags (respectively, principal ﬂags) parameterized by the cyclic
set C. Any ideal triangulation of S gives a triangulation of the inﬁnite polygon with vertices
the points of the cyclic set C. We take the face and edge functions for this triangulation.
Because of π1-equivariance, we get a ﬁnite set of functions coming from the edges and faces
of the triangulation of S. This set of functions forms a positive co-ordinate chart for XG′,S
(respectively AG,S). The co-ordinate charts coming from diﬀerent triangulations of the surface
give a positive atlas on XG′,S (respectively AG,S).
One of the goals of this paper will be to show that these edge and face functions can be
realized as part of a cluster ensemble structure on the pair of spaces (XG′,S,AG,S).

2.6. Cluster algebras. We review here the basic deﬁnitions of cluster algebras, following [W].
Cluster algebras are commutative rings that come equipped with a collection of distinguished
sets of generators, called cluster variables or A-coordinates. One can obtain one set of generators
from another set of generators by a process called mutation.
Each set of generators belongs to a seed, which roughly consists of the set of generators along
with a B-matrix. The B-matrix encodes how one mutates from one seed to any adjacent seed.
Starting from any initial seed, the process of mutation gives all the seeds (and all the sets of
generators) for the cluster algebra. The cluster variables are coordinates on the A-space.

The same combinatorial data underlying a seed gives rise to a second, related, algebraic
structure, called X -coordinates. The X -coordinates are functions on the X space. The A-
coordinates and X -coordinates are related by a canonical monomial transformation, which gives
a map from the A-space to the X -space. Together, the data of the A-space and the X -space,
along with their distinguished sets of coordinates, is called a cluster ensemble.
Cluster algebras and X -coordinates are deﬁned by seeds. A seed Σ = (I, I0, B, d) consists of

the following data:

(1) An index set I with a subset I0 ⊂ I of “frozen” indices.
(2) A rational I × I exchange matrix B. It should have the property that bij ∈ Z unless
(3) A set d = {di}i∈I of positive integers that skew-symmetrize B; that is, bijdj = −bjidi

both i and j are frozen.

for all i, j ∈ I.

For most purposes, the values of di are only important up to simultaneous scaling. Also note
that the values of bij where i and j are both frozen will play no role in the cluster algebra,
though it is sometimes convenient to assign values to bij for bookkeeping purposes. These
values become important in amalgamation, where one unfreezes some of the frozen variables.
Let k ∈ I \ I0 be an unfrozen index of a seed Σ. We say another seed Σ′ = µk(Σ) is obtained
from Σ by mutation at k if we identify the index sets in such a way that the frozen variables

3. The cluster algebra structure on Confm A for G = Sp2n

3.1. Construction of the seed. In this section we explain how to construct the seeds for
the cluster structure on Conf m A when G = Sp2n. Throughout this section, G = Sp2n unless
otherwise noted.

Recall that Sp2n is associated to the type C Dynkin diagram:

Cn

n − 2 n − 1

n

Figure 1 Cn Dynkin diagram

Figure 1 Dynkin diagram
The nodes of the diagram correspond to n− 1 short roots, numbered 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and one
long root, which is numbered n. To describe the cluster structure on Conf3 A, we need to give
the following data: the set I parameterizing vertices, the functions on Conf3 A corresponding
to each vertex, the B-matrix for this seed, and the multipliers di for each vertex i.

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

2 , while the remaining vertices have di = 1. We color the vertices with di = 1

The B-matrix is encoded via a quiver which consists of n2 + 2n vertices, of which n + 2 have
di = 1
2 white,
while the remaining vertices are black. There are n edge functions for each edge of the triangle,
and n2 − n face functions. There is one white vertex for each edge. The B-matrix is read oﬀ
from the quiver by the following rules:

• An arrow from i to j means that bij > 0.
• |bij| = 2 if di = 1 and dj = 1
2 .
• |bij| = 1 otherwise.

In Figure 2, we see the quiver for Sp6. The generalization for other values of n should be

clear.

structure for Conf3 ASp6

A dotted arrow means that bij is half the value it would be if the arrow were solid. In other

2 . and |bij| = 1

words, |bij| = 1 if di = 1 and dj = 1
We will no longer use single letters like i, j to denote vertices of the quiver, because it will
be convenient for us to use the pairs (i, j) to parameterize the vertices of the quiver. In the
formulas in the remainder of this section, we will not refer to the particular entries of the B-
matrix, bij. Instead, the values of the entries of the B-matrix will be encoded in quivers. This
will hopefully avoid any notational confusion.

2 otherwise.

Label the vertices of the quiver xij and yk, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The
white vertices correspond to xin and yn. The vertices yk and xij for i = 0 or n are frozen. We
will sometimes write xi,j for xij for orthographic reasons. Note that the dotted arrows only go
between frozen vertices, thus the entries bij of the B-matrix are integral unless i and j are both
frozen, and thus the B-matrix deﬁnes a cluster algebra.

12

IAN LE

Our next goal will be to deﬁne the functions attached to the vertices in the quiver. We ﬁrst
need to recall some facts about the representation theory of Sp2n. The fundamental repre-
sentations of Sp2n are labelled by the fundamental weights ω1, . . . , ωn. Sp2n has a standard
2n-dimensional representation V . Let < −,− > be the symplectic pairing. Then the repre-

sentation Vωi corresponding to ωi is a direct summand ofVi V . In fact, it is the kernel of the
homomorphismVi V →Vi−2 V that comes from contracting with the symplectic form. Note
that the symplectic form also induces an isomorphism betweenVi V andV2n−i V .

Let AG denote the principal aﬃne space for G. We will sometimes drop the subscript “G”if
it is clear which group we are referring to. There is a natural embedding of Sp2n ֒→ SL2n given
by taking the subgroup of SL2n that ﬁxes the symplectic form < vi, v2n+1−i >= (−1)i−1 (the
signs are chosen here to be compatible with the positive structures on Sp2n and SL2n). This
induces a natural embedding of ASp2n inside ASL2n , which we now describe.

The variety ASp2n parameterizes chains of isotropic vector spaces

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Vn ⊂ V

inside the 2n-dimensional standard representation V , where dim Vi = i, and where each Vi is
equipped with a volume form.

Equivalently, a point of ASp2n is given by a sequence of vectors

v1, v2, . . . , vn,

where

Vi :=< v1, . . . , vi >

is isotropic, and where vi is only determined up to adding linear combinations of vj for j < i.

The volume form on Vi is then v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vi.
From the sequence of vectors v1, . . . , vn, we can complete to a symplectic basis v1, v2, . . . v2n,
where < vi, v2n+1−i >= (−1)i−1, and < vi, vj >= 0 otherwise. Equivalently, the symplectic
form induces an isomorphism < −,− >: V → V ∗. At the same time, there are perfect pairings

Then vn+1, . . . , v2n are chosen so that this isomorphism takes v1 ∧ ··· vi to v1 ∧ ··· v2n−i.
subspaces

Then v1, v2, . . . v2n determines a point of ASL2n , as ASL2n parameterizes chains of vector

along with volume forms v1 ∧ ··· vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n.

From the embedding

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ V2n ⊂ V

one naturally gets an embedding Conf m ASp2n ֒→ Conf m ASL2n . We will deﬁne the cluster
functions on Conf m ASp2n via certain cluster functions on Confm ASL2n . In fact, we will see

ASp2n ֒→ ASL2n ,

later in this paper that the entire cluster algebra structure on Confm ASp2n comes from folding
the cluster algebra structure on Confm ASL2n .

It is well-known that the functions on AG are naturally isomorphic to

Mλ∈Λ+

Vλ.

The functions on Conf 3 ASL2n that we will use to deﬁne the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASp2n
will be invariants of triple tensor products of representations of SL2n, i.e., they will lie inside

Here the factors Vλ, Vµ, Vν correspond to a graded subspace of the vector space of functions on
the ﬁrst, second, and third ﬂags, respectively.

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G.

Let 1 ≤ a, b, c, d < N be four integers satisfying a > N − c > b, a > N − d > b and
a + b + c + d = 2N . Then there is a one-dimensional space of invariants inside the representation

We pick out the function given by the two equivalent webs in Figure 3.

Webs are a convenient tool for encoding tensor product invariants and for computing with
them. See [CKM] for their deﬁnition and for how one computes with them. The above diagram
deﬁnes the invariant we are looking for up to a sign, which depends on conventions for webs
that vary widely from author to author. For that reason, we give a more concrete description
of the function.

Given three ﬂags

ﬁrst consider the forms

w1, . . . , wN ;

Ua := u1 ∧ ··· ∧ ua,

Applying these maps to the ﬁrst and second factors of φa+c−N,N −a(Vc), respectively, and then

N = 2n. They pulling back gives a function on Conf3 ASp2n . We will use the notation a, b

Now let us deﬁne another, simpler, set of functions. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c < N be three integers such
that a+ b + c = N . Then there is a one-dimensional space of invariants inside the representation

The function can be calculated as follows. Given three ﬂags

w1, . . . , wN ;

ﬁrst consider the forms

Ua := u1 ∧ ··· ∧ ua,
Vb := v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vb,

Then Ua ∧ Vn ∧ Wc is a multiple of e1 ∧ ··· ∧ eN , and this multiple is the value of our function.

Call this function a

when N = 2n.

We are now ready to deﬁne the functions attached to the vertices. Here are the rules:

2n − k! to yk.

(1) We assign the function  k
(2) When i ≥ j, we assign the function  n − i
(3) When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function n − i, 2n + i − j
(4) When i = 0, we assign the function 2n − j

This completely describes the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASp2n . Note that the cluster struc-
ture is not symmetric with respect to the three ﬂags. Performing various S3 symmetries, we
obtain six diﬀerent possible cluster structures on Conf 3 ASp2n . We will later see that these

16

six structures are related by sequences of mutations. In Figure 5, we depict two of the clus-
ter structures for Conf3 ASp8 that are obtained from the original cluster structure by an S3
symmetry.

Let us describe in more detail how to obtain these other cluster structures. Let us ﬁrst
describe the quivers. If the S3 symmetry is even, i.e., a rotation, we just rotate the quiver.
If the S3 symmetry is odd, i.e., a transposition, we transpose the quiver and also reverse the
arrows.

The functions attached to the vertices come from permuting the arguments in our notation

for the function. For example, rotating the function  n − i, 2n + i − j

A function of the form  a

A function of the form a; b; c, d is similarly deﬁned using the cyclic shift map.

The cluster structure for Confm A comes from triangulating an m-gon and then attaching the
cluster structure on Conf3 A to each triangle. Let us make this more precise. On Conf 3 ASp2n ,
consider the vertices labelled yk, x0j and xnj. Attached to these vertices are the functions are

2n − j !, respectively. These are exactly the vertices that

j!, and  

j

were frozen. Moreover, all the functions attached to these vertices only depend on two of the
three ﬂags. We will call these the edge functions. Let us call all other functions face functions.
To form the quiver for Confm ASp2n , we ﬁrst take a triangulation of an m-gon. On each of
the m− 2 triangles, attach any one of the six quivers formed from performing S3 symmetries on
the quiver for Conf3 ASp2n described above. Each edge of each of these triangles has n frozen
vertices. Let us describe how to glue two triangles together.
Let T1, T2 be two triangles with edges e1, e2, e3 and e4, e5, e6, respectively. Suppose that we
would like to glue the edges e1 and e4. e1 and e4 each have n frozen vertices. We will glue these
2n vertices together in pairs to form n vertices. Each frozen vertex is glued to another vertex

that shares the same function (using the fact that  k

2n − k! = 2n − k

k !, etc.). These vertices

then become unfrozen. If vertices i and j are glued with i′ and j′ to get new vertices i′′ and
j′′, then we declare that

bi′′j′′ = bij + bi′j′ .

In other words, two dotted arrows in the same direction glue to give us a solid arrow, whereas
two dotted arrows in the opposite direction cancel to give us no arrow. One can easily check that
any gluing will result in no dotted arrows using the unfrozen vertices. The arrows involving
vertices that were not previously frozen remain the same. Figure 7 below shows one gluing
between two triangles for Sp6.

Figure 7. The functions and quiver for
the cluster algebra on Conf4 ASp6 .

Repeat this procedure for each interior edge of the triangulation, and one arrives at the quiver
for Conf m ASp2n . The procedure for gluing triangles is very reminiscent of the “amalgamation”
procedure in [FG4].

3.2. Reduced words. The goal of this section is to relate the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASp2n
given in the previous section to Berenstein, Fomin and Zelevinsky’s cluster structure on B, the
Borel in the group G ([BFZ]). This will allow us to see that the cluster structure described
above induces a positive structure on AG,S, and moreover that this positive structure on AG,S is
identical to the one given in [FG1]. In fact, it was the comparison between the cluster structures
in [BFZ] and [FG1] that was our original motivation for the construction of the previous section.
Moreover, this comparison gives heuristics for how to construct the cluster structure on
AG,S when G is an exceptional group. It will also clarify some computations that we do later
in the paper. However, for a reader not interested in the positive structure on AG,S, and
more interested in just understanding the cluster structure on AG,S, this section is not logically
necessary.
Let us also mention that our cluster structure can also be related to the cluster structure on
Bruhat cells in [FG4]. The paper [W] contains the clearest and most deﬁnitive statements on
the relationship between [FG4] and [BFZ].

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

Recall from equation (2) that the positive structure on Conf 3 ASp2n is given by a map

H × B− −→ Conf3(A) that sends

(h, b) → (U −, h · w0U −, b · w0U −).

Then the natural positive structure on H × B induces a positive structure on Conf 3 ASp2n .
This positive structure coincides with the one given in (2) [FG1]. Let us now restrict our
attention to triples of principal ﬂags of the form (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −). We can consider the
map

Now let us recall the constructions of [BFZ]. For u, v elements of the Weyl group W of G,

i : b ∈ B− → (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −) ∈ Conf3 ASp2n .

we have the double Bruhat cell

The cell Gw0,e is the on open part of B−.

Gu,v = B+ · u · B+ ∩ B− · v · Bv.

Proposition 3.1. The cluster algebra constructed above on Conf3 ASp2n , when restricted to
the image of i, coincides with the cluster algebra structure given in [BFZ] on B− = Gw0,e.

Proof. Gw0,e is the on open part of B−. Following [BFZ], to get a cluster structure on this
subset, we must choose a reduced-word for w0. In the numbering of the nodes of the Dynkin
diagram given above for Sp2n, we choose the reduced word expression

w0 = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)n.

Here our convention is that the above word corresponds to the string i1, i2, . . . , in−1, in repeated
n times.

Now let G0 = U −HU + ⊂ G be the open subset of elements of G having Gaussian decompo-
sition x = [x]−[x]0[x]+. Then for any two elements u, v ∈ W , and any fundamental weight ωi,
we can deﬁne the generalized minor ∆uωi,vωi (x). It is a rational function on G which is given
generically by the formula

∆uωi,vωi (x) := ([u−1xv]0)ωi .

In our situation, we are interested in such minors when u, v = e, or when v = e and

u = uij = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)i−1snsn−1 ··· sj for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and n ≥ j ≥ 1.
functions associated to u, v = e), and

Then the cluster functions on B− given in [BFZ] are ∆ωi,ωi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n (these are the

∆uij ωj ,ωj ,

which are the functions associated to v = e and u = uij = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)isnsn−1 ··· sj. Note
that uij is the subword of u that stops on the ith iteration of sj.

We have the following claims:

(1) Recall that when i = 0, we assign the function 2n − j

j! to xij . Then

 2n − j

j! = ∆ωj ,ωj

In other words, the function assigned to xij is precisely ∆ωj ,ωj .

22

IAN LE

(2) Recall that for i ≥ j, we assign the function  n − i
n + i − j ! = ∆uij ωj ,ωj
  n − i

j

n + i − j ! to xij . Then

j

In other words, the function assigned to xij is precisely ∆uij ωj ,ωj .

(3) Recall that when i < j, we assign the function n − i, 2n + i − j

n

! to xij . Then

j

 n − i, 2n + i − j

n

! = ∆uij ωj ,ωj

j

In other words, the function assigned to xij is precisely ∆uij ωj ,ωj .

The proof of these claims is a straightforward calculation. Let us carry out this calculation.

The calculation is not central to this paper, so can be safely skipped.

It is convenient to choose an embedding of Sp2n into SL2n. Moreover, choose the symplectic
form so that < ei, en+i >= (−1)i and all other pairings of basis elements are zero. The sign
is chosen so that the representation Sp2n ֒→ SL2n preserves positive structure. Now choose a
pinning such that under the embedding Sp2n ֒→ SL2n,

Eαn = En,2n, Fαn = En,2n,

and for 1 ≤ i < n,

Eαi = Ei,i+1 + En+i+1,n+i, Fαi = Ei+1,i + En+i,n+i+1.

Here Ei,j is the (i, j)-elementary matrix, i.e., the matrix with a 1 in the (i, j) position and 0 in
all other positions.

With respect to this embedding, we can directly calculate ∆ωj ,ωj (x) where x ∈ B−. When
x is embedded in SL2n, ∆ωj ,ωj (x) is simply the determinant of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst
j rows and the ﬁrst j columns. Similarly, one can calculate that ∆uij ωj ,ωj (x) is precisely the
determinant of the minor of x consisting of rows 2n + 1 − i, 2n + 2 − i, . . . , 2n + j − i (here the
indices are taken modulo 2n) and the ﬁrst j columns.

We then must calculate the functions 2n − j

on the triple of ﬂags (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −). Under the embedding Sp2n ֒→ SL2n, we should

the ﬂag e1, e2, . . . , en. Direct calculation then shows that  2n − j

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

The tetrahedron recurrence is really just a variation on the octahedron recurrence.

3.3. Cactus transformation. In this section, ﬁrst we collect the necessary facts that we need
about the “tetrahedron recurrence”, which can be interpreted as a sequence of mutations on
the cluster algebra for Conf3 ASLN . Most of what is in this section can be found in [Hen] or
[HK], though our notation is somewhat diﬀerent. We will relate this to our construction of the
cluster structure on Conf3 ASp2n . This will be useful for computations that we do later in the
paper.
It is
a sequence of mutations on the cluster algebra for Conf 3 ASLN that realizes the operation of
replacing three principal ﬂags by in the space V = Cn with the dual principal ﬂags in V ∗. Put
in another way, there is an outer automorphism of SLN given by g →t g−1. This automorphism
induces an automorphism φ on Conf3 ASLN . It turns out (though this is not obvious), that
this is an automorphism of the cluster structure on Conf3 ASLN , i.e., if xi are cluster variables
in one seed, then φ∗xi will be cluster variables in another seed. The sequence of mutations we
are interested in is a sequence of mutations transforming from the initial seed xi to the seed
consisting of the functions φ∗xi.

The name “tetrahedron recurrence”comes from the fact that all the cluster variables involved
can be put at the integral lattice points of a tetrahedron ([HK]). By performing this sequence
of mutations on various triangles in the triangulation of an m-gon, we get the action of the
cactus group on Conf3 ASLN . For this reason we will call the sequence of mutations realizing
the outer automorphism of SLN the “cactus seqence.”
First we need to review the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASLN . The quiver for this
cluster algera has a vertex xijk for all triples 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n such that i + j + k = n and no more
than one of i, j, k is equal to 0. The vertex xijk can be placed at the point (i, j, k) in the plane
i + j + k = n. Then the quiver looks as in Figure 8 for SL4.

We have used dotted arrows in line with the conventions above for amalgamation. The

function attached to xijk will then be  i

j ! in the notation of section 3.1. The frozen

k

vertices are xi,N −i,0, x0,j,N −j, xi,0,N −i.

Now we describe the sequence of mutations. First mutate xN −2,1,1. Then mutate xN −3,2,1
and xN −3,1,2. Then mutate xN −4,3,1, xN −4,2,2, xN −4,1,3. Continue in this manner, until we
mutate x1,1,N −2. Then we start the sequence over again by mutating xN −2,1,1, but the second
time through, we stop at x2,1,N −3. The third time through, we stop at x3,1,N −4. We continue
in this manner so that the whole sequence of mutations is

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2, xN −4,3,1, xN −4,2,2, xN −4,1,3, . . . x1,N −2,1, . . . x1,1,N −2,

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2, xN −4,3,1, xN −4,2,2, xN −4,1,3, . . . x2,N −3,1, . . . x2,1,N −3,

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2, xN −4,3,1, xN −4,2,2, xN −4,1,3, . . . x3,1,N −4,

. . .

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2,

xN −2,1,1.

Perhaps it is more useful to describe the sequence in another way. Think of the quiver for
Conf 3 ASLN as consisting of rows, where row r consists of all xijk where i = r. Then for
r = N − 2, N − 3, . . . 2, 1, there are N − 1 − r vertices in that row. We start by mutating the
one vertex in row N − 2, then the two vertices in row N − 3, then the three vertices in row
N − 4, etc. The sequence of rows that we mutate is

N − 2, N − 3, N − 4, . . . , 2, 1, N − 2, N − 3, . . . , 3, 2, N − 2, . . . , 3, . . . , . . . , N − 2, N − 3, N − 2.
There are (N − 2)(N − 1)/2 terms in the above list. This gives a total of N (N − 1)(N2)/6
mutations. Let us think of the sequence of mutations as happening in N − 2 stages, where at
stage r we mutate all the vertices in rows N − 2, N − 3, . . . , r, in that order. It turns out that
because of how the quiver transforms, the mutations in any given row can be performed in any
order.

There is actually even more freedom in the order in which we perform mutations. Suppose
at some point in the sequence of mutations, we want to mutate row i for the jth time. It turns
out that any vertex in row i can be mutated only after

• the two vertices in row i − 1 directly below it have been mutated j − 1 times and
• the two vertices in row i + 1 directly above it have been mutated j times.

The combinatorics of this will become clear after we analyze the how the quiver transforms

under mutations. Thus we have many equivalent sequences of mutations.

For example, we could mutate the rows

N − 2, N − 3, N − 2, N − 4, N − 3, N − 2, N − 5, . . . , N − 2, N − 6, . . . , . . . , 1, 2, 3, . . . , N − 2.
getting the mutation sequence

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2, xN −2,1,1, xN −4,3,1, xN −4,2,2, xN −4,1,3, xN −3,2,1, xN −3,1,2, xN −2,1,1

. . . , x1,N −2,1, . . . , x1,1,N −2, x2,N −3,1, . . . , x2,1,N −3, x3,N −4,1, . . . , . . . , xN −2,1,1.

Let us now analyze how the quiver transforms. In Figure 9 we picture the quiver for SL5,
the result after mutating row 3, the result after mutating rows 3, 2, the result after and the
result after mutating rows 3, 2, 1. The pattern should be clear for SLN .

Note that at each stage, we rearrange some of the frozen vertices to make the structure of

the quiver more transparent. The non-frozen vertices, however, do not move.

We see that after the mutations in rows N − 2, N − 3, . . . 1 have been performed, we end up
with the quiver for SLN −1 in the top N − 1 rows of the diagram. We may then inductively see
that after each descending sequence of rows has been mutated, we get the quivers pictured in

The ﬁnal quiver we arrive at is essentially the original quiver with arrows reversed (addition-

ally, frozen vertices have moved and some arrows have changed between frozen vertices).

Now we must understand the functions attached to the vertices at the quiver at various

stages. Note that xijk is mutated i times.

Proposition 3.2. The function associated to xijk tranforms as follows:

k

We now specialize to N = 2n. The cactus sequence will allow us to give an alternative way
to construct the cluster algebra structure for Conf3 ASp2n . We perform the following sequence
of mutations on Conf 3 ASL2n :

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x1,1,N −2

xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,2,N −3

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x2,1,N −3

xN −4,3,1, xN −5,3,2, . . . , x1,3,N −4

xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x2,2,N −4

xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , xn−2,2,n

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , xn−1,1,n

One can picture the above sequence as consisting of n − 1 stages, where each stage consists
of mutating all vertices lying in a parallelogram. The result will be that we get the quiver
pictured in Figure 12 (all frozen vertices have been deleted for simplicity)

Figure 12. The functions and quiver
for the cluster Conf3 ASL2n which
folds to give a cluster for Conf 3 ASp2n .

The function attached to xijk (here we take i, j, k > 0 to exclude frozen vertices) will be

k

j ! if j ≥ n,
•  i
•  n + j, i + j − n

n

k + n − j

! if j < n and k < n (in fact for j ≤ n and k ≤ n; equality

cases agree with the cases above and below),

• (2n − i, i + j; k + i) if k ≥ n.

Thus we see that the functions attached to xijk and xikj pull back to the same functions on
Conf 3 ASp2n via the embedding Conf3 ASp2n ֒→ Conf 3 ASL2n . Here we use the identities (6).
In fact, for j ≥ k and j ≥ n, we have that the vertex xijk corresponds to the vertex xn−i,k in
the quiver for Conf 3 ASp2n , while for j ≥ k and j < n, we have that the vertex xijk corresponds
to the vertex xk,n+k−j .
The result of this is that we can obtain the cluster structure on Conf3 ASp2n as follows: Start
with the standard cluster algebra on Conf3 ASL2n , which has functions attached to vertices xijk.
Perform series of mutations given above, which is a subsequence of the cactus sequence. Then
fold the resulting cluster structure by identifying the following pairs of vertices: xi,2n−i,0 and
x2n−i,i,0; xi,0,2n−i and x2n−i,0,i; x0,j,2n−j and x0,2n−j,j; xijk and xikj for i, j, k > 0.

Let us say a few words about folding. Suppose we have a cluster algebra C such that its
quiver is preserved under an involution σ. Note that this forces vertices in the same orbit to
have no arrows between them. Then we may form a new cluster algebra C′. The B-matrix for
C′ comes from quotienting the quiver for C by the involution σ and then coloring the vertices
ﬁxed under the involution white and all other vertices black. On the level of algebras, one
sets the variables for vertices in the same orbit equal. It is not hard to check that mutating a
vertex in C′ corresponds to unfolding, mutating all lifts of that vertex in C, and then folding
again. Thus we constructed above a cluster for Conf 3 ASL2n which folds to give a cluster for

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

33

Conf 3 ASp2n . For more details about the procedure of folding for cluster algebras, and for
folding under more general automorphisms, see [FZ2].
More invariantly, there is an outer automorphism of SL2n that has Sp2n as its ﬁxed lo-
cus. This gives an involution of Conf3 ASL2n (and more generally Confm ASL2n ) that has
Conf 3 ASp2n (respectively, Confm ASp2n ) as its ﬁxed locus. It turns out that the cluster alge-
bra structure on Conf 3 ASL2n is preserved by this involution, and that, moreover, there is a
particular seed, constructed above, that is preserved by this involution. Folding this seed gives
the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASp2n .
Let us make some observations. Let σ be the Dynkin diagram automorphism of A2n−1
having quotient Cn. (We call this automorphism σ by abuse of notation: we will see soon that
it induces the automorphism of the quiver that we called σ above.) Then σ induces a map on
the root system for SL2n, and hence on the fundamental weights and the dominant weights.
It also induces an outer automorphism of SL2n having ﬁxed locus Sp2n, and an involution on
the spaces Conf m ASL2n. Let π be the map from the vertices of A2n−1 to the vertices of Cn.
This induces a map π sending fundamental weights to corresponding fundamental weights, and
therefore projects the weight space for SL2n to the weight space for Sp2n.
Observation 3.3. Let f be a function on Conf 3 ASL2n that lies in the invariant space

Then σ∗(f ) lies in the invariant space

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]SL2n.

[Vσ(λ) ⊗ Vσ(µ) ⊗ Vσ(ν)]SL2n .

Observation 3.4. Let f be a function on Conf 3 ASL2n that lies in the invariant space

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]SL2n.

Then as a function on Conf3 ASp2n , f lies in the invariant space

[Vπ(λ) ⊗ Vπ(µ) ⊗ Vπ(ν)]Sp2n .

Observation 3.5. Consider a cluster for Conf3 ASL2n which folds to give a cluster for Conf3 ASp2n .
Suppose v is a vertex in the quiver for this cluster. Let fv is the function attached to v. Then

fv ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]SL2n,

fσ(v) ∈ [Vσ(λ) ⊗ Vσ(µ) ⊗ Vσ(ν)]SL2n .

However, on Conf 3 ASp2n , fv = fσ(v). This means that we must have π(λ) = π(σ(λ)), π(µ) =
π(σ(µ)), and π(ν) = π(σ(ν)).

It is also clarifying to step back and motivate the sequence of mutations realizing the cactus
sequence above. As explained in section 3.2, the cluster structure on Conf 3 A comes from
a reduced word for the longest element w0 in the Weyl group of G. The initial seed for
Conf 3 ASL2n is built using the reduced word

s1s2 . . . s2n−1s1s2 . . . s2n−2 . . . s1s2s3s1s2s1.

It is known how to use
Here s1, . . . , s2n−1 are the generators of the Weyl group for SL2n.
cluster transformations to pass between the clusters that are associated to diﬀerent reduced
words ([BFZ]). The cactus sequence transforms between the cluster above and the cluster

s2n−1s2n−2 . . . s1s2n−1s2n−2 . . . s2 . . . s2n−1s2n−2s2n−3s2n−1s2n−2s2n−1.

Thus we have the following observation, which we do not believe has been made elsewhere:

Observation 3.6. The cactus sequence may be viewed as the sequence of mutations relating
the cluster structures on Conf3 ASLN related to the reduced words
s1s2 . . . sN −1s1s2 . . . sN −2 . . . s1s2s3s1s2s1

and

sN −1sN −2 . . . s1sN −1sN −2 . . . s2 . . . sN −1sN −2sN −3sN −1sN −2sN −1.

The subsequence of the cactus sequence given above transforms the initial cluster into the

cluster associated with the reduced word

(snsn−1sn+1sn−2sn+2 . . . s1s2n−1)n.

This reduced word is in some sense “intermediate” between the two other reduced words dis-
cussed above.
Now let s′

n be the generators of the Weyl group of Sp2n. There is an injection from

2, . . . s′

1, s′

the Weyl group of Sp2n to the Weyl group of SL2n that takes

Under this map,

s′
n → sn,

s′
i → sis2n−i.

(s′

ns′

n−1 . . . s′

1)n → (snsn−1sn+1sn−2sn+2 . . . s1s2n−1)n

Therefore the reduced word for the longest element of the Weyl group of SL2n folds to give the
reduced word for the longest element of the Weyl group of Sp2n. So the folding that gives the
cluster structure on Conf 3 ASp2n from the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASL2n really takes place
on the level of Weyl groups.

3.4. The sequence of mutations realizing S3 symmetries. We consider the cluster struc-
ture on Conf3 ASp2n described above. In fact, because the cluster structure we gave was not
symmetric, we have described six diﬀerent cluster structures on Conf3 ASp2n . We would now
like to give sequences of mutations relating these six clusters to show that they are actually all
clusters in the same cluster algebra.

From the folding construction of the previous section, it is clear that we could unfold the
cluster structure of Conf 3 ASp2n to get the cluster structure on Conf3 ASL2n , perform a sequence
of mutations on Conf 3 ASL2n , and then refold to obtain one of the other cluster structures on
Conf 3 ASp2n . The question then becomes whether we can realize this sequence of mutations
“upstairs” on Conf3 ASL2n “downstairs”on Conf 3 ASp2n . It is by no means obvious that this
is possible. Let us give two reasons for this. First, mutating one vertex downstairs generally
corresponds to mutating two vertices upstairs (the two that are folded together to give the
vertex downstairs), so that this severely restricts the possible sequences of mutations upstairs.
Second, note that if we perform the naive procedure of passing to Conf3 ASL2n and performing
a sequence of mutations there, when we refold, we are generally no longer folding together the
same pairs of vertices.

We will realize the S3 symmetries on Conf3 ASp2n by exhibiting sequences of mutations that
realize two diﬀerent transpositions in the group S3. As we shall see, one of these transpositions
can actually be realized by going going “upstairs” and using the calculations of the previous
section with some care. The other transposition requires a completely diﬀerent analysis.

3.4.1. The ﬁrst transposition. Let (A, B, C) ∈ Conf3 ASp2n be a triple of ﬂags. Let us ﬁrst give
the sequence of mutations that realizes that S3 symmetry (A, B, C) → (A, C, B).

The sequence of mutations is as follows:

x11, x21, x22, x12, x13, x23, x33, x32, x33, . . . , x1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,1,

x11, x21, x22, x12, . . . x1,n−2, . . . , xn−2,n−2, . . . , xn−2,1,

(7)

. . . ,

x11, x21, x22, x12,

x11

The sequence can be thought of as follows: At any step of the process, we mutate all xij
such that max(i, j) is constant. It will not matter in which order we mutate these xij because
the vertices we mutate have no arrows between them. So we ﬁrst mutate the xij such that
max(i, j) = 1, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 2, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 3, etc.
The sequence of maximums that we use is

1, 2, 3, . . . n − 1, 1, 2, . . . n − 2 . . . , 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.

In Figure 13, we depict how the quiver and functions for Conf 3 ASp8 changes after performing
the sequences of mutations of xij having maximums 1; 1, 2; and 1, 2, 3. The initial quiver is in
Figure 5.

From these diagrams the various quivers in the general case of Conf3 ASp2n should be clear.
Theorem 3.7. If max(i, j) = k, then xij is mutated a total of n − k times. Recall that

when i ≥ j, we assign the function   n − i

n + i − j ! to xij . Thus the function attached to xij

j

transforms as follows:

n + i − j ! → 2n − 1, n − i − 1
  n − i

n + i − j + 1

j + 1

! → 2n − 2, n − i − 2

n + i − j + 2

When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function n − i, 2n + i − j
 n − i, 2n + i − j

Proof. We will give two approaches. One is conceptually transparent, but hard to carry out.
The second it more direct.

The ﬁrst approach would be to use what we know about the cactus sequence. Recall that if

we start with the standard cluster structure on Conf3 ASL2n and perform the mutations

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x1,1,N −2
xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,2,N −3
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x2,1,N −3
xN −4,3,1, xN −5,3,2, . . . , x1,3,N −4
xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x2,2,N −4
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x3,1,N −4

. . .

xn,n−1,1, xn−1,n−1,2, . . . , x1,n−1,n

. . .

xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , xn−2,2,n
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , xn−1,1,n

then if we identify the vertices xijk and xikj , we obtain the cluster algebra structure on
Conf 3 ASp2n . Recall that for j ≤ k and j ≥ n, we have that the vertex xijk corresponds
to the vertex xn−i,k in the quiver for Conf3 ASp2n , while for j ≤ k and j < n, we have that the
vertex xijk corresponds to the vertex xn−k,n+k−j .
If we then apply the sequence of mutations (7)

x11, x21, x22, x12, x13, x23, x33, x32, x33, . . . , x1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,1,

x11, x21, x22, x12, . . . x1,n−2, . . . , xn−2,n−2, . . . , xn−2,1,

. . . ,

x11, x21, x22, x12,

x11

on the cluster algebra for Conf 3 ASp2n , we can lift this sequence of mutations to the unfolded
cluster algebra for Conf3 ASL2n . There, once we keep track of indices, we ﬁnd that the cluster
we end up with is exactly the result of applying the sequence of mutations

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, . . . , x1,N −2,1
xN −3,1,2, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,N −3,2
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, . . . , x1,N −2,1
xN −4,1,3, xN −5,2,3, . . . , x1,N −4,3

xN −3,1,2, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,N −3,2

. . .

xn,1,n−1, xn−1,2,n−1, . . . , x1,n,n−1

. . .

xN −3,1,2, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,N −3,2
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,2,1, . . . , x1,N −2,1

to the original seed for Conf 3 ASL2n .
Again, we then identify the vertices xijk and xikj and look downstairs on Conf3 ASp2n . Then
the roles of j and k are exactly reversed: For k ≤ j and k ≥ n, we have that the vertex xijk
corresponds to the vertex xn−i,j in the transposed quiver for Conf 3 ASp2n , while for k ≤ j and
l < n, we have that the vertex xijk corresponds to the vertex xn−j,n+j−k in the transposed
quiver.

Alternatively, and perhaps more simply, it is enough to observe that all that mutations in
the sequence (7) reduce to one of the cluster transformations depicted in Figure 11, and that
all the identities involved are exactly those listed in our identiﬁcation of the functions involved
in the cactus sequence of mutations.

(cid:3)

ij, y′

Now consider the original seed for the cluster algebra structure on Conf 3 ASp2n , where the
quiver had vertices xij , yk for 0 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n. Now consider the seed that has quiver
with vertices x′
k that comes from exchanging the roles of the second and third principal
ﬂags. Then the sequence of mutations explained mutates the functions associated to xij into
those associated to x′
j, and the
functions yj are equal to the functions x′
0j . Moreover, the associated quiver on the vertices
xij , yk mutates into the corresponding quiver on the vertices x′
k. Thus, this sequence of
mutations relates the two seeds that come from the transposition of the second and third ﬂags.

3.4.2. The second transposition. Let us now give the sequence of mutations that realizes that
S3 symmetry (A, B, C) → (C, B, A).

The sequence of mutations is as follows:

xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x1,2, . . . , x1,n,
xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x2,3, . . . , x2,n,
xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x3,4, . . . , x3,n,

. . . xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n,

(8)

xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n

xn−1,n

The sequence can be thought of as follows: We only mutate those xij with i < j. At any
step of the process, we mutate all xij in the kth row (the kth row consists of xij such that i = k)
such that i < j. It will not matter in which order we mutate these xij . The sequence of rows
that we mutate is

n − 1, n − 2 . . . , 2, 1n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 2, n, . . . , 3, . . . , n − 1, n − 2, n − 1.

In Figure 15, we depict how the quiver for Conf3 ASp10 changes after performing the sequence
of mutations of xij in rows 4; 4, 3; 4, 3, 2; and 4, 3, 2, 1. We only depice those functions that are
aﬀected by this mutation sequence.

Figure 16c. The quiver and functions
for Conf3 ASp10 after performing the
sequence of mutations of xij in rows
4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4.

The circle on several of the arrows depicts how the quiver for Conf3 ASp10 lifts to Conf 3 ASL10.
We will elaborate upon this further when we analyze how the functions transform. From these
diagrams the various quivers in the general case of Conf3 ASp2n should be clear.
Now we need to understand the various functions attached to the vertices of the quiver at
diﬀerent stages in the sequence of mutations. In order to do this, we need to deﬁne some new
functions.

Let N = 2n. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N such that a, c ≤ n, b, d ≥ n, and a + b + c + d = 4n = 2N .

Then we would like to deﬁne a function that we will call

  a, b

n, n

!.

c, d

This is a function on Conf 3 ASp2n that is pulled back from a function on Conf3 ASL2n . The
function on Conf3 ASLN is given by an invariant in the space

Let us give a concrete description of this function.
Given three ﬂags

ﬁrst consider the forms

u1, . . . , uN ;
v1, . . . , vN ;
w1, . . . , wN ;

Ua := u1 ∧ ··· ∧ ua,
Ub := u1 ∧ ··· ∧ ub,
Vn := v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vn,
Wc := w1 ∧ ··· ∧ wc,
Wd := w1 ∧ ··· ∧ wd.

Because n + c = 2N − b − d + n − a, there is a natural map

φN −d,N −b,n−a :^n+c

V →^N −d

V ⊗^N −b

V ⊗^n−a

V.

Note that φN −d,N −b,n−a can be thought of as the composite of φ2N −d−b,n−a and φN −d,N −b.
There are also natural maps

and

− ∧ Wd :^N −d
Ub ∧ − :^N −b
Ua ∧ Vn ∧ − :^n−a

V →^N
V →^N
V →^N

V ≃ F,
V ≃ F,

V ≃ F.

Applying these maps to the ﬁrst, second, and third factors of φN −d,N −b,n−a(Vn ∧ Wc), re-
spectively, and then multiplying, we get get the value of our function. This is a function
on Conf 3 ASLN . Pulling back gives a function on Conf 3 ASp2n . This deﬁnes the function

c, d

n, n

! on Conf3 ASLN and Conf 3 ASp2n .

  a, b
We now deﬁne the function  a

!, which is the twisted cyclic shift of the function

which acts on three principal ﬂags A, B, C as follows:

T : Conf3 A → Conf3 A

Then

(A, B, C) → (sG · C, A, B).

We are now ready to analyze for the functions in our cluster algebra transform under the
sequence of mutations (8). Note that in the above sequence of mutations (8), xij is mutated i
times if i < j.

Theorem 3.8. If i < j, then xij is mutated a total of i times. Recall that when i < j, we

assign the function  n − i, 2n + i − j

n

! to xij . The function attached to xij transforms as

j

follows:

 n − i, 2n + i − j
 n − i + 2, 2n + i − j − 2

n, n

n

! → n − i + 1, 2n + i − j − 1

n, n

j − 1, n + 1

j − 2, n + 2

→ 2n − j

n

j − i, n + i

! = j

n

n − i, 2n + i − j

!

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

The ﬁrst transformation can be seen as the composite of two steps,

 n − i, 2n + i − j

n

! → n − i, 2n + i − j

n, n

j

! → n − i + 1, 2n + i − j − 1

n, n

j, n

while the last transformation can also be seen as the composite of two steps,

 n − 1, 2n − j + 1

n, n

j − i + 1, n + i − 1

! → n, 2n − j

n, n

j − i, n + i

! → 2n − j

n

j − 1, n + 1

!,

j − i, n + i

!.

Then with each transformation, two of the parameters increase by one, and two decrease by
one.

Proof. We have already described the quivers at the various stages of mutation. We must then
check that the functions above satisfy the identities of the associated cluster transformations.
This is the ﬁrst sequence of mutations where we have to mutate the white vertices xin (yn
is also a white vertex, but it does not get mutated). For a black vertex xij , recall that the
formula for mutation of says that

(old function attached to xij )(new function attached to xij ) =

Y(functions attached to incoming arrows) +Y(functions attached to outgoing arrows).

However, for black vertices, we have

(old function attached to xij )(new function attached to xij ) =

Y(incoming arrows from white vertices)(incoming arrows from black vertices)2+
Y(outgoing arrows from white vertices)(outgoing arrows from black vertices)2.

In other words, arrows going from black to white vertices are weighted by 2 when calculating
the mutation of a white vertex.

In verifying the cluster identities that we need, we will actually be computing functions on
Conf 3 ASLN . Thus we will use the arrows with a circle on them as a bookkeeping device.
Circled arrows only occur between two black vertices. If a black vertex x has an incoming or
outgoing circled arrow from another black vertex x′, this means that in computing the mutation
of x, we should use the dual of the function attached to x′.

The reason for this is as follows. We can lift the quiver Q for Conf 3 ASpN to a quiver ˜Q for
Conf 3 ASLN using the following rule. For each vertex black vertex x, there are two lifts of this
vertex in ˜Q, call them x∗ and x∗∗. Then for every regular arrow between two black vertices x
and x′ in the quiver Q, we lift it to the correponding arrow between x∗ and x′∗ and between
x∗∗ and x′∗∗. On the other hand, for every arrow with a circle between two black vertices x
and x′ in the quiver Q, we lift it to the correponding arrow between x∗∗ and x′∗ and between
x∗ and x′∗∗.

Now suppose x is a black vertex and x′ is a white vertex. x has lifts x∗ and x∗∗, while x′
has just one lift x′∗. Then an arrow between x and x′ in the quiver Q lifts to the corresponding
arrows between x∗ and x′∗ and between x∗∗ and x′∗. Hence, when computing the mutation of
x′, we use the product of the function attached to x and the dual of this function.

With these rules in mind, we are ready to compute mutations.
We need the following facts:

  a, b

c − 1, d + 1

• If a + c = n and b + d = 3n,

• Let 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N , and a + b + c + d = 2N .

• We will need the duality identities of (6), and also the following duality identity:

All these identities can be checked by computing with webs. All identities but the ﬁrst follow
directly from the deﬁnitions. Let us give an alternative proof the ﬁrst (and most important)
identity.

3.5. The sequence of mutations for a ﬂip. Recall that to construct the cluster structure
(a quiver plus the set of functions attached to the vertices) on Conf4 ASp2n , we choose a tri-
angulation of the 4-gon, as well as one of the six cluster structures on Conf3 ASp2n for each
of the resulting triangles. The previous section showed how to mutate between the six cluster
structures on each triangle. In this section, we will give a sequence of mutations that relates two
of the clusters coming from diﬀerent triangulations of the 4-gon. Combined with the previous
section, this allows us to connect by mutations all 72 diﬀerent clusters we have constructed for
Conf 4 ASp2n (for each of the two triangulations, we have 6· 6 diﬀerent clusters). This will allow
us to connect by mutations all the clusters that we have constructed on Conf m ASp2n .
Given a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) ∈ Conf 4 ASp2n , we will give a sequence of mutations
that relates a cluster coming from the triangulation ABC, ACD to a cluster coming from the
triangulation ABD, BCD.

We will need to relabel the quiver with vertices xij , yk, with −n ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n and

1 ≤ |k| ≤ n. The quiver we will start with is as in Figure 18, pictured for Sp6.

Remark 3.9. Note that our labelling of the vertices is somewhat diﬀerent from before. The
vertices labelled xij correspond to the vertices labelled xn−|i|,j in Conf 3 ASp2n .

First, let us deﬁne the functions above. Note that there are natural maps

p1, p2, p3, p4 : Conf 4 ASp2n → Conf 3 ASp2n

that map a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) to (B, C, D), (A, C, D), (A, B, D), (A, B, C), respectively
. Pulling back functions from Conf3 ASp2n allows us to deﬁne functions on Conf4 ASp2n . For
example,

3 n

Similarly, we can pull back functions from various maps

to deﬁne functions such as

The forgetful maps and twist maps, combined with the functions described below, will furnish
all the functions necessary for the computation of the ﬂip mutation sequence.

More interestingly, we will have to use some functions which depend on all four ﬂags. Let
N = 2n. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N such that a + b + c + d = 4n = 2N and b + c ≤ N . Then we

Applying these maps to the ﬁrst and second factors of φN −b−c,N −d(Ua), respectively, and then
multiplying, we get get the value of our function. This is a function on Conf 4 ASLN . Pulling
back gives a function on Conf4 ASp2n .
We now deﬁne a second type of function on Conf 4 ASp2n . Let 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N such that

Now we give the sequence of mutations realizing the ﬂip of a triangulation. The sequence of
mutations leaves x−n,j, xnj, yk untouched as they are frozen variables. Hence we only mutate
xij for −n ≤ i ≤ n. We now describe the sequence of mutations. The sequence of mutations
will have 3n − 2 stages. At the rth step, we mutate all vertices such that

|i| + j ≤ r,

j − |i| + 2n − 2 ≥ r,
|i| + j ≡ r mod 2.

Note that the ﬁrst inequality is empty for r ≥ 2n − 1, while the second inequality is empty

for r ≤ n. For example, for Sp6, the sequence of mutations is

The analogue Conf4 ASp2n should be clear. Note that there are no circled arrows in the
diagram, so that lifting from this sequence of mutations from Conf4 ASp2n to Conf4 ASL2n is
straightforward.

We now have the main theorem of this section:

Theorem 3.10. We ﬁrst analyze the situation when i > 0. The vertex xij is mutated a total
of n − i times. There are four cases.

• When i + j < n and i < j, the function attached to xij mutates in three stages,

consisting of n − i − j, i, and j − i mutations, respectively:

The mutation sequence when i ≤ 0 is completely parallel. We include it in an appendix.
In all these sequences, for each mutation, two parameters increase, and two decrease. Within
a stage, the same parameters increase or decrease. The only exception is that sometimes after

the last mutation, one removes the factor n

The ﬁrst three sets of identities are the most important. They are variations on the octahe-
dron recurrence. When i + j < n and i < j, the three stages use the ﬁrst, second and third set
of identities, respectively. When i + j ≥ n and i < j, the two stages use the second and third
set of identities, respectively. When i + j < n and i ≥ j, the two stages use the ﬁrst and second
set of identities, respectively. When i + j ≥ n and i ≥ j, the one stage uses only the second set
of identities.
The last three sets of identities are used to give degenerate versions of the previous three

sets of identities.

4. The cluster algebra structure on Confm G/U for G = Spin2n+1

We now deﬁne the cluster algebra structure on Confm G/U when G = Spin2n+1. The
story will be parallel to the previous case when G = Sp2n. The similarities are quite strik-
ing, and reﬂect the Langlands duality between the seeds as predicted in [FG2]. As in that
case we will utilize what we understand about functions on Confm ASL2n+1 in order to study
Conf m ASpin2n+1 .

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

Recall that Spin2n+1 is the double cover of the group SO2n+1, which is the subgroup of
SL2n+1 preserving a symmetric quadratic form. We take the quadratic form given in the basis
standard basis e1, . . . , e2n+1 by

and < ei, ej >= 0 otherwise.

< ei, e2n+2−i >= (−1)i−1

Remark 4.1. Here the signs are chosen so that the embedding is compatible with the positive
structures on Spin2n+1 and SL2n+1. Note that the signature of the quadratic form is (n + 1, n),
so that taking real points gives the split real form of SO2n+1. The cluster algebra structure
on Confm ASpin2n+1 gives another way of deﬁning the positive structure on ASpin2n+1,S, which
gives a parameterization of the Hitchin component for the group Spin2n+1 and the surface S.
This Hitchin component is a component of the character variety for a split real group G and a
surface S.

The maps

induce maps

Spin2n+1 ։ SO2n+1 ֒→ SL2n+1

Confm ASpin2n+1 → Conf m ASO2n+1 → Confm ASL2n+1.

Let us describe these maps concretely. The variety ASO2n+1 parameterizes chains of isotropic

vector spaces

inside the 2n + 1-dimensional standard representation V , where dim Vi = i, and where each Vi
is equipped with a volume form.

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Vn ⊂ V

Equivalently, a point of ASO2n+1 is given by a sequence of vectors

where

v1, v2, . . . , vn,

Vi :=< v1, . . . , vi >

is isotropic, and where vi is only determined up to adding linear combinations of vj for j < i.

The volume form on Vi is then v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vi.
From the sequence of vectors v1, . . . , vn, we can complete to a basis v1, v2, . . . v2n+1, where
< vi, v2n+2−i >= (−1)i−1, and < vi, vj >= 0 otherwise. Equivalently, the quadratic form
induces an isomorphism < −,− >: V → V ∗. At the same time, there are perfect pairings

gives an isomorphism

Then vn+1, . . . , v2n+1 are chosen so that this isomorphism takes v1 ∧ ··· vi to v1 ∧ ··· v2n+1−i.

Then v1, v2, . . . v2n+1 determines a point of ASL2n+1, as ASL2n+1 parameterizes chains of

vector subspaces

along with volume forms v1 ∧ ··· vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1.

From the embedding

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ V2n+1 = V

ASO2n+1 ֒→ ASL2n+1,

one naturally gets an embedding Conf m ASO2n+1 ֒→ Confm ASL2n+1. We can then pull back
functions from Conf m ASL2n+1 to get functions on Confm ASO2n+1 . However, we are ultimately
interested in functions on Confm ASpin2n+1 .
will be invariants of tensor products of representations of Spin2n+1. For m = 3, they will lie
inside

The functions on Confm ASpin2n+1 that we will use to deﬁne the cluster structure on Confm ASpin2n+1

where λ, µ, ν are elements of the dominant cone inside the weight lattice. In general, not all
such functions will come from pulling back functions on Conf m ASL2n+1.

However, suppose that

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G

Then

f ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G ⊂ O(Conf m ASpin2n+1 ).
f 2 ∈ [V2λ ⊗ V2µ ⊗ V2ν]G ⊂ O(Conf m ASpin2n+1 ).

However, because 2λ, 2µ, 2ν are dominant weights for SO2n+1, f 2 may be viewed as a function
on Confm ASO2n+1 . This function is then a pull-back of a function on Confm ASL2n+1. Therefore
functions on Conf m ASpin2n+1 are either the pull-backs of functions on Confm ASL2n+1 or square-
roots of such functions. The square-root here corresponds to the fact that Spin2n+1 is a double
cover of SO2n+1. The choice of the branch of the square-root that we take is determined by
the positive structure on Conf m ASpin2n+1 : if f is a positive function on Conf m ASL2n+1 such
that its square-root is a function on Conf m ASpin2n+1 , there is a unique choice of √f that is
positive on Confm ASpin2n+1 . That is the square-root that we will always take.
4.1. Construction of the seed. We are now ready to construct the seed for the cluster
structure on Confm A when G = Spin2n+1. Throughout this section, G = Spin2n+1 unless
otherwise noted.

Recall that Spin2n+1 is associated to the type B Dynkin diagram:

Bn

1

2

n − 2 n − 1

n

Figure 23 Bn Dynkin diagram

The nodes of the diagram correspond to n − 1 long roots, numbered 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and one
short root, which is numbered n. To describe the cluster structure on Conf 3 A, we need to give
the following data: the set I parameterizing vertices, the functions on Conf3 A corresponding
to each vertex, and the B-matrix for this seed.
The B-matrix is encoded via a quiver which consists of n2 + 2n vertices, of which n + 2 have
2 . We color the vertices with di = 1 black, while

di = 1, while the remaining vertices have di = 1

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

83

the remaining vertices are white. There are n edge functions for each edge of the triangle, and
n2 − n face functions. There is one black vertex for each edge. The B-matrix is read oﬀ from
the quiver by the following rules:

• An arrow from i to j means that bij > 0.
• |bij| = 2 if di = 1 and dj = 1
2 .
• |bij| = 1 otherwise.

In Figure 24, we see the quiver for Spin7. The generalization for other values of n should be

clear.

structure for Conf3 ASpin7

A dotted arrow means that bij is half the value it would be if the arrow were solid. In other

2 . and |bij| = 1

words, |bij| = 1 if di = 1 and dj = 1
We will no longer use single letters like i, j to denote vertices of the quiver, because it will
be convenient for us to use the pairs (i, j) to parameterize the vertices of the quiver. In the
formulas in the remainder of this section, we will not refer to the particular entries of the B-
matrix, bij. Instead, the values of the entries of the B-matrix will be encoded in quivers. This
will hopefully avoid any notational confusion.

2 otherwise.

Label the vertices of the quiver xij and yk, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The
white vertices correspond to xin and yn. The vertices yk and xij for i = 0 or n are frozen. We
will sometimes write xi,j for xij for orthographic reasons. Note that the dotted arrows only go
between frozen vertices, thus the entries bij of the B-matrix are integral unless i and j are both
frozen, and thus the B-matrix deﬁnes a cluster algebra.

Let us now recall some facts about the representation theory of Spin2n+1. The fundamental
representations of Spin2n+1 are labelled by the fundamental weights ω1, . . . , ωn. Spin2n+1 has
a standard 2n+ 1-dimensional representation V . Let < −,− > be the orthogonal pairing. Then

84

IAN LE

for i < n the representation Vωi corresponding to ωi is preciselyVi V . The representation Vωn
is the spin representation of Spin2n+1. The representation V2ωn is isomorphic toVn V .

We now say which functions are attached to the vertices of the quiver. Recall the functions
deﬁned via the webs from Figures 3, 4, and 6. It turns out to be easier to describe the functions
attached to the white vertices and the square of the functions attached to the black vertices.
In other words, if the function fij is attached to vertex xij , it is sometimes more convenient to
consider the function f 2dij
. Thus we break down the description of the functions attached to
xij into steps:

ij

k

2n + 1 − k! to yk.
n + 1 + i − j ! to xij .

(1) For k < n, assign the function 
(2) When i ≥ j, assign the function  n − i
(3) When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j
(4) When i = 0, we assign the function 2n + 1 − j

j! to xij .

j

! to xij .

j

n + 1

(5) Now take the square root of the functions assigned to xin and yn.

This completely describes the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 . The fact that we can take
the square-roots of the functions assigned to xin and yn and get functions that are well-deﬁned
on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 follows from the computations of the next section. Note that the cluster
structure is not symmetric with respect to the three ﬂags. Performing various S3 symmetries,
we obtain six diﬀerent possible cluster structures on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 . These six structures are
related by sequences of mutations that we describe in the next section. Below, in Figure 25,
we depict two of the six cluster structures for Conf 3 ASpin9 that are obtained from the original
cluster structure by an S3 symmetry.

Figure 25b. Another cluster structures
for Conf3 ASpin9 related by to the ﬁrst
by an S3 symmetry.

Let us describe in more detail how to obtain these other cluster structures. As before, if the
S3 symmetry is a rotation, we just rotate the quiver. If the S3 symmetry is a transposition, we
transpose the quiver and also reverse the arrows.

The functions attached to the vertices come from permuting the arguments in our no-

tation for the function. For example, rotating the function  n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j
the function

The cluster structure for Confm A comes from triangulating an m-gon and then attaching the
cluster structure on Conf3 A to each triangle and then using the procedure of amalgamation.
As before, the vertices yk, x0j and xnj will lie on the edges of the triangle, and the functions
attached to them are edge functions. On Conf 3 A the edge vertices are frozen, and the functions
attached to these edges depend on only two of the three ﬂags. All other functions are face
functions.

To form the quiver for Conf m ASpin2n+1 , we ﬁrst take a triangulation of an m-gon. On each
of the m− 2 triangles, attach any one of the six quivers formed from performing S3 symmetries
on the quiver for Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 . Each edge of each of these triangles has n frozen vertices.
For any two triangles sharing an edge, the corresponding vertices on those edges are identiﬁed.
Those vertices become unfrozen.

If vertices i and j are glued with i′ and j′ to get new vertices i′′ and j′′, then we declare that

bi′′j′′ = bij + bi′j′ .

In other words, two dotted arrows in the same direction glue to give us a solid arrow, whereas
two dotted arrows in the opposite direction cancel to give us no arrow. One can easily check
that, again, any gluing will result in no dotted arrows using the unfrozen vertices. The arrows
involving vertices that were not previously frozen remain the same. Figure 26 below shows one
gluing between two triangles for Spin7.

Figure 26. The functions and
quiver for the cluster algebra on
Conf 4 ASpin7 .

In the next section, we discuss Langlands duality, which will give us a framework for relating,
and explaining the similarities between, the cluster algebra structures on Conf m AG for G =
Sp2n and Spin2n+1.

4.2. Langlands duality. In this section, we make some remarks related to Langlands duality.
Note that the quivers for Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 and Conf3 ASp2n are the same, except that white
and black vertices switch colors. Moreover, if we mutate corresponding vertices in the quivers
for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 and Conf 3 ASp2n , the relationship persists: we still get the same quivers,
but with colors reversed. This is because the seeds we have constructed for the cluster algebras
on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 and Conf 3 ASp2n are Langlands dual seeds:
Deﬁnition 4.2. [FG2] Two seeds that have the same set of vertices I and the same set of frozen
vertices I0 are said to be Langlands dual if they have B-matrices bij and b∨
ij and multipliers di
and d∨

i where

di = (d∨

i )−1D,

for some rational number D.

bij dj = −b∨

ijd∨
j ,

Remark 4.3. Note that the multipliers di for a cluster algebra are determined only up to
simultaneous scaling by a rational number. Conventions sometimes diﬀer on how to specify the
values for the di. This is one reason the rational number D appears in the above deﬁnition.
Remark 4.4. The cluster algebras for Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 and Conf 3 ASp2n as we have deﬁned them
satisfy

bijdj = b∨

ijd∨
j ,

without the negative sign. Negating the B-matrix does note change the cluster algebra, and for
that reason a B-matrix and its negative are often considered to be equivalent. The reason that
[FG2] include a negative sign in their deﬁnition is to make the quantization of the “modular
double” cleaner. We will ignore this issue for most of this paper.

preserved under amalgamation.

In fact, the seeds for Confm ASpin2n+1 and Conf m ASp2n are Langlands dual; the property is
When two seeds are Langlands dual, there is a close relationship between the resulting cluster
algebras. Suppose that (I, I0, bij, di) and (I, I0, b∨
i ) are Langlands dual seeds. Let the cluster
variables for the initial seeds be x1, . . . , xn and x∨
n, respectively. These cluster variables
are naturally in bijection. Then if we mutate xk to obtain the new cluster variable x′
k, we can
do the same to x∨
k)∨. Continuing in this manner, one
conjecturally gets a bijection between all the cluster variables for the Langlands dual seeds. Let
us make an observation:

k and (x′

Observation 4.5. Suppose that we have a cluster variable

Then if f ∨ is the dual cluster variable to f , then

f ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]Sp2n ⊂ O(Conf 3 ASp2n ).

if f is associated to a black vertex and f ∨ is associated to a white vertex, while

f ∨ ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]Spin2n+1 ⊂ O(Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 )

f ∨ ∈ [Vλ/2 ⊗ Vµ/2 ⊗ Vν/2]Spin2n+1 ⊂ O(Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 )
if f is associated to a white vertex and f ∨ is associated to a black vertex.

This is clearly true in the initial cluster, and as long as all the cluster variables are functions
on Conf3 ASp2n and Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 , and not just rational functions on those spaces (as we
expect, but do not know how to prove), it is easy to check that the above observation remains
true under mutation. Certainly, in all the clusters we consider in this paper this will be the
case, as is borne out in the computations that follow.

This gives us the following principle which will underlie the computations of the S3 symme-

tries on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 and the ﬂip on Conf4 ASpin2n+1 :
Observation 4.6. We can compute the formulas for the cluster variables on Conf3 ASpin2n+1
and Conf4 ASpin2n+1 that appear at various stages of mutation in the following way: Start with
the formula for the corresponding cluster variable on Confm ASp2n . Replace every instance of
“a” where 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1 by “a,” and replace every instance of “2n − a” where 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1
by “2n + 1 − a.” Every instance of “n” should be replaced by either “n” or “n + 1,” depending
on the context. Take a square-root if the cluster variable corresponds to a black vertex for
Conf m ASpin2n+1 . One then obtains the formula for the cluster variable on Confm ASpin2n+1 .

All the formulas we derive for Spin2n+1 will follow this principle.

4.3. Reduced words. We now relate the cluster structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 given in the
previous section to Berenstein, Fomin and Zelevinsky’s cluster structure on B, the Borel of the
group G ([BFZ]). This will imply that the cluster we constructed induces the same positive
structure on AG,S as given in [FG1]. For a reader not interested in the positive structure on
AG,S, and more interested in just understanding the cluster structure on AG,S, this section is
not logically necessary.
Let us now restrict our attention to triples of principal ﬂags of the form (U −, w0U −, b·w0U −).

We can consider the map

i : b ∈ B− → (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −) ∈ Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 .

For u, v elements of the Weyl group W of G, we have the double Bruhat cell

The cell Gw0,e is the on open part of B−.

Gu,v = B+ · u · B+ ∩ B− · v · Bv.

Proposition 4.7. The cluster algebra constructed above on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 , when restricted
to the image of i, coincides with the cluster algebra structure given in [BFZ] on B− = Gw0,e.

Proof. Gw0,e is the on open part of B−. Following [BFZ], to get a cluster structure on this
subset, we must choose a reduced-word for w0. In the numbering of the nodes of the Dynkin
diagram given above for Spin2n+2, we choose the reduced word expression

w0 = (snsn∗ sn−1 ··· s2s1)n.

Here our convention is that the above word corresponds to the string i1, i2, . . . , in−1, in∗ in
repeated n times.

Now let G0 = U −HU + ⊂ G be the open subset of elements of G having Gaussian decompo-
sition x = [x]−[x]0[x]+. Then for any two elements u, v ∈ W , and any fundamental weight ωi,
we have the generalized minor ∆uωi,vωi(x) deﬁned by

∆uωi,vωi (x) := ([u−1xv]0)ωi .

In our situation, we are interested in such minors when u, v = e, or when v = e and

u = uij = (snsn∗sn−1 ··· s2s1)i−1snsn∗ sn−1 ··· sj for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and n ≥ j ≥ 1.
functions associated to u, v = e), and, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, n∗, n,

Then the cluster functions on B− given in [BFZ] are ∆ωi,ωi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n (these are the

∆uij ωj ,ωj ,

which are the functions associated to v = e and u = uij = (snsn∗ sn−1 ··· s2s1)isnsn∗ sn−1 ··· sj.
Note that uij is the subword of u that stops on the ith iteration of sj.

We have the following claims:

(1) Recall that when i = 0, we assign the function  2n + 1 − j
vuut n + 1

n! to xin. Then

 2n + 1 − j

j! = ∆ωj ,ωj ,

n! = ∆ωn,ωn.

(2) Recall that for i ≥ j 6= n, we assign the function   n − i

n + 1 + i − j ! = ∆uij ωj ,ωj

for j 6= n and

(3) Recall that when i < j < n, we assign the function  n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

Then

! = ∆uinωn,ωn .

vuut n − i, n + 1 + i

n + 1

n + 1

n

! to xin. Then

n

Thus, in all cases the function assigned to xij is precisely ∆uij ωj ,ωj .
The proof of these claims is a straightforward calculation.
It is convenient to ﬁx maps Spin2n+1 ։ SO2n+1 ֒→ SL2n+1. Choose the quadratic form
so that < ei, e2n+2−i >= (−1)i−1 and all other pairings of basis elements are zero. The sign
is chosen so that the representation Spin2n+1 ֒→ SL2n+1 preserves positive structure. Now
choose a pinning such that under the map Spin2n+1 → SL2n+1,

Eαn = √2(En,n+1 + En+1,n+2), Fαn = √2(En+1,n + En+2,n+1),

and for 1 ≤ i < n,

Eαi = Ei,i+1 + E2n+1−i,2n+2−i, Fαi = Ei+1,i + E2n+2−i,2n+1−i.

Here Ei,j is the (i, j)-elementary matrix, i.e., the matrix with a 1 in the (i, j) position and 0 in
all other positions.

With respect to this embedding, we can directly calculate ∆ωj ,ωj (x) where x ∈ B−. When x
is embedded in SL2n+1, ∆ωj ,ωj (x) is simply the determinant of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst
j rows and the ﬁrst j columns for j < n, while ∆ωn,ωn(x) is the square-root of the determinant
of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst n rows and columns.

92

IAN LE

Similarly, one can calculate that ∆uij ωj ,ωj (x) only depends on the entries in rows n + i +
1, n + i, . . . , n + 2, 1, 2, . . . n − i and the ﬁrst n columns. In particular, for j < n, ∆uij ωj ,ωj (x) is
the determinant of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst j of those rows (in the order listed above)
and the ﬁrst j columns, while for j = n, it is the square-root of the determinant of the minor
consisting of all n rows listed and the ﬁrst n columns.

We then must calculate the functions

 2n + 1 − j

j!,  n − i

n + 1 + i − j !, n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

n + 1

on the triple of ﬂags (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −). Under the embedding Sp2n+1 ֒→ SL2n+1, we
should choose the ﬂag U − to be be e2n+1,−e2n, e2n−1, dots, (−1)nen+1, so that w0U − is given

by the ﬂag e1, e2, . . . , en. Direct calculation then shows that 2n − j
 n − i, 2n + i − j

n + i − j ! and
! are given by the appropriate determinants of minors or square-roots of

j!,  n − i

these determinants of minors.

(cid:3)

Finally, note that we have the following equalities of functions:

(10)

k

 
2n + 1 − k! = 2n + 1 − k
n + 1 + i − j ! = n + 1 + i
  n − i

n − i + j

These equalities arise because the quadratic form induces an isomorphism betweenVi V and
V2n+1−i V .

4.4. Relationship with cactus transformations. As in the case of Sp2n, the cactus se-
quence can be used to construct the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 . The mate-
rial of this section is not relevant to the remainder of the paper. We include this material for
the following reasons: for the sake of completeness; to emphasize the parallels between Sp2n
and Spin2n+1; to motivate some computations that we perform later; and to point out a new
phenomenon similar to folding of cluster seeds that deserves study in its own right.

Recall the cactus sequence of mutations on Conf3 ASLN . We now specialize to N = 2n + 1.
The cactus sequence will allow us to give an alternative way to construct the cluster al-
gebra structure for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 . We perform the following sequence of mutations on
Conf 3 ASL2n+1:

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x1,1,N −2
xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x1,2,N −3
xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x2,1,N −3

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

xN −4,3,1, xN −5,3,2, . . . , x1,3,N −4

xN −3,2,1, xN −4,2,2, . . . , x2,2,N −4

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , x3,1,N −4

. . .

xn+1,n−1,1, xn,n−1,2, . . . , x1,n−1,n+1

xn+2,n−2,1, xn,n−1,2, . . . , x2,n−2,n+1

. . .

xN −2,1,1, xN −3,1,2, . . . , xn−1,1,n+1

of mutating all vertices lying in a parallelogram.

One can picture the above sequence as consisting of n − 1 stages, where each stage consists
Additionally, we perform the following sequence of mutations, which are “half” of the mu-

tations in the next stage.

xn,n,1, xn−1,n,2, . . . , x2,n,n−1

xn+1,n−1,1, xn,n−1,2, . . . , x4,n−1,n−2

. . .

xN −4,3,1, xN −5,3,2

xN −3,2,1

The result will be that we get the quiver pictured in Figure 27 for Spin7.

The function attached to xijk (here we take i, j, k > 0 to exclude frozen vertices) will be

•  i
•  n + j, i + j − n − 1
•  n + 1 + j, i + j − n

k + n + 1 − j

k + n − j

! if k < j < n + 1 and k < n + 1,
! if k ≤ j < n + 1,

Thus we see that the functions attached to xijk and xikj pull back to the same function
on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 via the map Conf3 ASpin2n+1 → Conf 3 ASL2n+1. Here we use the identities
(6). In fact, for j > k and j ≥ n + 1, we have that the vertex xijk corresponds to the vertex
xn−i,k in the quiver for Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 , while for j > k and j ≤ n, we have that the vertex
xijk corresponds to the vertex xk,n+1+k−j .
The vertices where j = k do not correspond to vertices for the quiver for the cluster al-
gebra on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 . However, something interesting happens. Note that the function

n

used as cluster functions on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 , we can use the above identity to express them in
terms cluster functions. This identity will become useful to us later.
The result of this is that we can ﬁnd the cluster functions on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 as follows:
Start with the standard cluster algebra on Conf3 ASL2n+1, which has functions attached to
vertices xijk. Perform series of mutations given above, which is a subsequence of the cactus

sequence. Discard the functions n + 1 + j, n + 1 − j

n

! attached to x2n+1−2j,j,j. Identify the

96

following pairs of vertices, which have functions which are equal when restricted to the image
of Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 : xi,2n−i,0 and x2n−i,i,0; xi,0,2n−i and x2n−i,0,i; x0,j,2n−j and x0,2n−j,j; xijk
and xikj for i, j, k > 0 and j 6= k. Now take the square-roots of the appropriate functions (those
that correspond to xi,n or yn). The only problem is that it is unclear to us how to read oﬀ the
correct B-matrix/quiver. This phenomenon, which is reminiscent of folding of cluster algebras,
deserves to be investigated more generally.

More invariantly, there is an outer automorphism of SL2n+1 that has SO2n+1 as its ﬁxed
locus. This gives an involution of Conf 3 ASL2n+1 (and more generally Confm ASL2n+1) that has
Conf 3 ASO2n+1 (respectively, Confm ASO2n+1 ) as its ﬁxed locus. It turns out that the cluster
algebra structure on Conf 3 ASL2n is preserved by this involution. Moreover, there is a particular
seed, constructed above, that is almost preserved by this involution: only the functions attached
to x2n+1−2j,j,j change.

It is also clarifying to step back and motivate the sequence of mutations realizing the cactus
sequence above. As explained in section 3.2, the cluster structure on Conf 3 A comes from
a reduced word for the longest element w0 in the Weyl group of G. The initial seed for
Conf 3 ASL2n+1 is built using the reduced word

s1s2 . . . s2ns1s2 . . . s2n−1 . . . s1s2s3s1s2s1.

Here s1, . . . , s2n are the generators of the Weyl group for Conf3 ASL2n+1. It is known how to
use cluster transformations to pass between the clusters that are associated to diﬀerent reduced
words ([BFZ]). The cactus sequence transforms between the cluster above and the cluster
associated to the reduced word

s2ns2n−1 . . . s1s2ns2n−1 . . . s2 . . . s2ns2n−1s2n−2s2ns2n−1s2n.

The subsequence given above transforms the initial cluster into the cluster associated with

the reduced word

(snsn+1snsn−1sn+2sn−2sn+3 . . . s1s2n)n.

1, s′

2, . . . s′

Now let s′

from the Weyl group of Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 to the Weyl group of Conf3 ASL2n+1 that takes

n be the generators of the Weyl group of Conf 3 ASp2n . There is an injection

s′
n → snsn+1sn,
s′
i → sis2n+1−i.

Thus we see that the folding-like phenomenon that relates the cluster structures on Conf3 ASpin2n+1
and Conf3 ASL2n+1 has an incarnation on the level of Weyl groups.

4.5. The sequence of mutations realizing S3 symmetries and ﬂips. We have described
six diﬀerent cluster structures on Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 . We would now like to give sequences of
mutations relating these six clusters to show that they are actually all clusters in the same
cluster algebra.

As in the case of Sp2n, we will realize the S3 symmetries on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 by exhibiting
sequences of mutations that realize two diﬀerent transpositions in the group S3. In fact, the
sequences of mutations used to realize these transpositions is the same as for Sp2n. This is a
reﬂection of the Langlands duality between the seeds for Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 and Conf 3 ASp2n . As
before, the identities used in the mutation sequence of one of these transpositions are exactly
those of the cactus sequence. The other transposition requires a diﬀerent analysis.

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

97

4.5.1. The ﬁrst transposition. Let (A, B, C) ∈ Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 be a triple of ﬂags. The se-
quence of mutations that realizes that S3 symmetry (A, B, C) → (A, C, B) is the same as (7):

x11, x21, x22, x12, x13, x23, x33, x32, x33, . . . , x1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,n−1, . . . , xn−1,1,

x11, x21, x22, x12, . . . x1,n−2, . . . , xn−2,n−2, . . . , xn−2,1,

(11)

. . . ,

x11, x21, x22, x12,

x11

The sequence can be thought of as follows: At any step of the process, we mutate all xij
such that max(i, j) is constant. It will not matter in which order we mutate these xij because
the vertices we mutate have no arrows between them. So we ﬁrst mutate the xij such that
max(i, j) = 1, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 2, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 3, etc.
The sequence of maximums that we use is

1, 2, 3, . . . n − 1, 1, 2, . . . n − 2 . . . , 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.

The evolution of the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 is just as in the case for Conf3 ASp2n , as
pictured in Figures 13 and 14, with the only diﬀerence being that black and white vertices
switch colors.

In Figure 28, we depict how the quiver for Conf 3 ASpin9 changes after performing the se-

quence of mutations of xij having maximums 1; 1, 2; and 1, 2, 3.

Figure 29b The quiver and the func-
tions for Conf3 ASpin9 after perform-
ing the sequence of mutations of xij
having maximums 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.

From these diagrams the various quivers in the general case of Conf3 ASpin2n+1 should be

clear.

Theorem 4.8. If max(i, j) = k, then xij is mutated a total of n − k times. Recall that when

i ≥ j, we assign the function   n − i

n + 1 + i − j ! to xij . Thus the function attached to xij

j

transforms as follows:

n + 1 + i − j ! → 2n, n − i − 1
  n − i

n + i − j + 2

j

! → 2n − 1, n − i − 2

n + i − j + 3

function attached to xij transforms as follows:

When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function  n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j
 n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j
→ j − i + 1, n + i + 2

! → n − i − 1, 2n + i − j

Proof. The proof is identical to the case where G = Sp2n. Note that we do note mutate
any of the vertices that have square-roots. The functions with square-roots are involved in
the mutations, as we mutate vertices adjacent to them; however, because of the values of the
multipliers di, the mutation of a white vertex involves only squares of the functions attached to
black vertices. Therefore, we see that the identities we need to use are exactly those appearing
in the cactus sequence.

(cid:3)

The above sequence of mutations takes us from one seed for the cluster algebra structure on
Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 to another seed where the roles of the second and third principal ﬂags have
been reversed. Thus, we have realized the ﬁrst of the transpositions necessary to construct all
the S3 symmetries of Conf3 ASpin2n+1 .
4.5.2. The second transposition. Let us now give the sequence of mutations that realizes that
S3 symmetry (A, B, C) → (C, B, A).

The sequence of mutations is as in the case of Sp2n, (8):

xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x1,2, . . . , x1,n,
xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x2,3, . . . , x2,n,
xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, . . . , x3,4, . . . , x3,n,

. . . xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n,

(12)

xn−1,n, xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n

xn−1,n

The sequence can be thought of as follows: We only mutate those xij with i < j. At any
step of the process, we mutate all xij in the kth row (the kth row consists of xij such that i = k)
such that i < j. It will not matter in which order we mutate these xij . The sequence of rows
that we mutate is

n − 1, n − 2 . . . , 2, 1n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 2, n, . . . , 3, . . . , n − 1, n − 2, n − 1.

As in the previous transposition, the evolution of the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 is just as in
the case for Conf 3 ASp2n , as pictured in Figures 15 and 16, with the only diﬀerence being that
black and white vertices switch colors.
In Figure 30, we depict how the quiver for Conf3 ASpin11 changes after performing the se-

quence of mutations of xij in rows 4; 4, 3; 4, 3, 2; and 4, 3, 2, 1.

The circles on several of the arrows are a bookkeeping device that tell us how to lift a function
from Conf3 ASpin11 to Conf3 ASL11 in the way that is most convenient for our computations.
From these diagrams the various quivers in the general case of Conf3 ASpin2n+1 should be clear.

Recall the functions deﬁned via Figures 17. They will appear when we perform the sequence

of mutations above. In particular, we make use of functions of the form

 n − i, n + 1 + i

n, n + 1

n − j, n + 1 + j

!.

These functions are invariants (unique up to scale) of the tensor product

These functions will have square-roots which are invariants (again, unique up to scale) of the
tensor product

[V2ωn−i ⊗ V4ωn ⊗ V2ωn−j ]Spin2n+1 .

Thus

is a well-deﬁned function on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 .
state the main theorem of this section.

Note that in the above sequence of mutations, xij is mutated i times if i < j. We can now

Theorem 4.9. If i < j, then xij is mutated a total of i times. Recall that when i < j, we

assign the either the function n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

n

! or its square-root to xij depending on

j

whether j < n or j = n. For j < n, the function attached to xij transforms as follows:

 n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

n + 1

! → n − i + 1, 2n + i − j

n, n + 1

j

j − 1, n + 2

→ 2n + 1 − j
 n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

!

The ﬁrst transformation can be seen as the composite of two steps,

→ n − i + 1, 2n + i − j

n, n + 1

n, n + 1

j − 1, n + 2

! → n − i, 2n + 1 + i − j

→ 2n + 1 − j

n

 n − 1, 2n + 2 − j

n, n + 1

while the last transformation can also be seen as the composite of two steps,

j − i, n + i + 1

!

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

Then with each transformation, two of the parameters increase by one, and two decrease by
one.

For j = n, we use the same formulas, but take the square roots of all the resulting functions.

Proof. We have already described the quivers at the various stages of mutation. We must then
check that the functions above satisfy the identities of the associated cluster transformations.
This is the ﬁrst sequence of mutations where we have to mutate the black vertices xin (yn
is also black, but it does not get mutated). Proving that the black vertices mutate as expected
will be our most diﬃcult task.

In verifying the cluster identities that we need, we will actually be computing functions on
Conf 3 ASLN . Thus we will use the arrows with a circle on them as a bookkeeping device.
Circled arrows only occur between two white vertices. If a white vertex x has an incoming or
outgoing circled arrow from another white vertex x′, this means that in computing the mutation
of x, we should use the dual of the function attached to x′.

With these rules in mind, we are ready to compute mutations.
We will need the following facts, which are analogous to the previous facts used for the case

of Sp2n. Let N = 2n + 1:

• Let 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N , and a + b + c + d = 2N .

All these identities can be proved by the same method as we used for G = Sp2n and N = 2n.
All cluster mutations of white vertices are obtained as before: they are either the ﬁrst identity
in the above list, or they are degenerations of this identity, and are obtained from the ﬁrst one
by applying the other three identities.

The mutation of black vertices requires some more work. We will also make use of functions

of the form

where x = n or n + 1, y = n or n + 1, and a + b + x + y + c + d = 3N . These functions are

4.6. The sequence of mutations for a ﬂip. In this section, we will give a sequence of
mutations that relates two of the clusters coming from diﬀerent triangulations of the 4-gon.
Combined with the previous section, this allows us to connect by mutations all 72 diﬀerent
clusters we have constructed for Conf4 ASpin2n+1 .
Given a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) ∈ Conf4 ASpin2n+1 , we will give a sequence of mutations
that relates a cluster coming from the triangulation ABC, ACD to a cluster coming from the
triangulation ABD, BCD.

We will need to relabel the quiver with vertices xij , yk, with −n ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n and

1 ≤ |k| ≤ n. The quiver we will start with is as in Figure 32, pictured for Spin7.

We will describe the functions attached to these vertices in two steps. First we will assign
some functions to each vertex. Then we will take the square-root of the functions assigned to
the black vertices.

Let N = 2n + 1. First make an assigment of functions to vertices as follows:

while the face functions in the triangle where i < 0 are

Remark 4.10. Note that our labelling of the vertices is somewhat diﬀerent from before. The
vertices labelled xij correspond to the vertices labelled xn−|i|,j in Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 .

Now, take the square-root of the functions assigned to xin, yn. For example, when i > 0 we

assign

that map a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) to (B, C, D), (A, C, D), (A, B, D), (A, B, C), respectively.
Pulling back functions from Conf3 ASpin2n+1 allows us to deﬁne functions on Conf4 ASpin2n+1 .
For example,

The forgetful maps and twist maps, combined with the constructions below, will furnish all the
functions necessary for the computation of the ﬂip mutation sequence.

As in the case of G = Sp2n, we will have to use some functions which depend on all four
ﬂags. Let N = 2n + 1. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N such that a + b + c + d = 4n + 2 = 2N and
b + c ≤ N . Then we would like to deﬁne a function that we will call

is a well-deﬁned function on Conf4 ASpin2n+1 . This is because the representations Vωa and Vωb
of SLN give the same representations of SpinN , and Vωn and Vωn+1, as representations of
SpinN , have twice the weight of the spin representation.

Now we give the sequence of mutations realizing the ﬂip of a triangulation. The sequence
of mutations is exactly as in the case for Sp2n. The sequence of mutations leaves x−n,j, xnj, yk
untouched as they are frozen variables. Hence we only mutate xij for −n ≤ i ≤ n. We now
describe the sequence of mutations. The sequence of mutations will have 3n − 2 stages. At the
rth step, we mutate all vertices such that

|i| + j ≤ r,

j − |i| + 2n − 2 ≥ r,
|i| + j ≡ r mod 2.

Note that the ﬁrst inequality is empty for r ≥ 2n − 1, while the second inequality is empty

for r ≤ n. For example, for Spin7, the sequence of mutations is

We now have the main theorem of this section:

Theorem 4.11. We ﬁrst analyze the situation when i > 0. The vertex xij is mutated a total
of n − i times. There are four cases.

• When i + j < n and i < j, the function attached to xij mutates in three stages,

consisting of n − i − j, i, and j − i mutations, respectively:

The mutation sequence when i ≤ 0 is completely parallel. We include it in an appendix for
In all these sequences, for each mutation, two parameters increase, and two decrease. Within
a stage, the same parameters increase or decrease. The only exception is that sometimes after

The proof of the mutation identities is much like when G = Sp2n. The ﬁrst three sets of
identities are the most important. They are variations on the octahedron recurrence. When
i + j < n and i < j, the three stages use the ﬁrst, second and third set of identities, respectively.
When i + j ≥ n and i < j 6= n, the two stages use the second and third set of identities,
respectively. When i + j < n and i ≥ j, the two stages use the ﬁrst and second set of identities,
respectively. When i + j ≥ n and i ≥ j, the one stage uses only the second set of identities.
The last three sets of identities are used to give degenerate versions of the previous three
sets of identities.

The main novelty occurs when j = n. Here we are mutating black vertices. Here we will
need to derive some new identities. The general mutation identity when j = n has the following
form:

a, N − a

a + 1, N − a − 1

Simply substitute each term on the left hand side of the last three identities with the cor-
responding term on the right-hand side into the ﬁrst identity. Cancelling will give the general
mutation identity. All other mutation identities for j = n come from this one using degeneracies.
The ﬁrst of the above identities is of a type we have seen before. The last three identities are
equivalent. We will prove the ﬁrst of the last three. Observe that a variation on the octahedron
recurrence gives

5. The cluster algebra structure on Confm G/U for G = Spin2n

We now deﬁne the cluster algebra structure on Confm G/U when G = Spin2n. In fact, to
emphasize the parallels with the case of G = Spin2n+1, we will let G = Spin2n+2. When
G = Spin2n+2, the cluster algebra structure, along with the mutations realizing S3 symmetries
and the ﬂip of triangulation, will be an unfolding of the same structures for G = Spin2n+1

We will utilize what we understand about functions on Confm ASL2n+2 in order to study
Conf m ASpin2n+2 . However, because the Dynkin diagram of Spin2n+2 is not obtained from
SL2n+2 by folding, as was the case for Sp2n and Spin2n+1, there will be additional complica-
tions, particularly regarding signs.

Recall that Spin2n+2 is the double cover of the group SO2n+2, which is the subgroup of
SL2n+2 preserving a symmetric quadratic form. We take the quadratic form given in the basis
standard basis e1, . . . , e2n+2 by

< ei, e2n+3−i >= (−1)i−1

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, and < ei, ej >= 0 otherwise.
Remark 5.1. Note that the signature of the quadratic form is (n + 1, n + 1), so that taking real
points gives the split real form of SO2n+2. The cluster algebra structure on Confm ASpin2n+2
gives another way of deﬁning the positive structure on ASpin2n+2,S, which gives a parameteri-
zation of the Hitchin component for the group Spin2n+2 and the surface S.

The maps

induce maps

Spin2n+2 ։ SO2n+2 ֒→ SL2n+2

Confm ASpin2n+2 → Conf m ASO2n+2 → Confm ASL2n+2.

Let us describe these maps concretely. The variety ASO2n+2 parameterizes chains of isotropic

vector spaces

inside the 2n + 2-dimensional standard representation V , where dim Vi = i, and where each Vi
is equipped with a volume form.

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Vn+1 ⊂ V

Equivalently, a point of ASO2n+2 is given by a sequence of vectors

where

v1, v2, . . . , vn+1,

Vi :=< v1, . . . , vi >

is isotropic, and where vi is only determined up to adding linear combinations of vj for j < i.

The volume form on Vi is then v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vi.

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

141

From the sequence of vectors v1, . . . , vn+1, we can complete to a basis v1, v2, . . . v2n+2, where
< vi, v2n+3−i >= (−1)i−1, and < vi, vj >= 0 otherwise. Equivalently, the quadratic form
induces an isomorphism < −,− >: V → V ∗. At the same time, there are perfect pairings

that induce an isomorphism

Composing this with the inverse of the isomorphism

gives an isomorphism

Then vn+2, . . . , v2n+2 are chosen so that this isomorphism takes v1 ∧ ··· vi to v1 ∧ ··· v2n+2−i
for i ≤ n + 1.
Then v1, v2, . . . v2n+2 determines a point of ASL2n+2, as ASL2n+2 parameterizes chains of
vector subspaces

along with volume forms v1 ∧ ··· vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1.

From the embedding

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ V2n+2 = V

ASO2n+2 ֒→ ASL2n+2,

one naturally gets an embedding Conf m ASO2n+2 ֒→ Confm ASL2n+2. We can then pull back
functions from Conf m ASL2n+2 to get functions on Confm ASO2n+2 . However, we are ultimately
interested in functions on Confm ASpin2n+2 .
will be invariants of tensor products of representations of Spin2n+2. For m = 3, they will lie
inside

The functions on Confm ASpin2n+2 that we will use to deﬁne the cluster structure on Confm ASpin2n+2

where λ, µ, ν are elements of the dominant cone inside the weight lattice. In general, not all
such functions will come from pulling back functions on Conf m ASL2n+2.

However, suppose that

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G

Then

f ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G ⊂ O(Conf m ASpin2n+2 ).
f 2 ∈ [V2λ ⊗ V2µ ⊗ V2ν]G ⊂ O(Conf m ASpin2n+2 ).

However, because 2λ, 2µ, 2ν are dominant weights for SO2n+2, f 2 may be viewed as a function
on Confm ASO2n+2 . This function is then a pull-back of a function on Confm ASL2n+2. Therefore
functions on Conf m ASpin2n+2 are either the pull-backs of functions on Confm ASL2n+2 or square-
roots of such functions. The square-root here corresponds to the fact that Spin2n+2 is a double
cover of SO2n+2. The choice of the branch of the square-root that we take is determined by
the positive structure on Conf m ASpin2n+2 : if f is a positive function on Conf m ASL2n+2 such
that its square-root is a function on Conf m ASpin2n+2 , there is a unique choice of √f that is
positive on Confm ASpin2n+2 . That is the square-root that we will always take. We discuss this
issue further in the section on signs.
It will often be convenient to write down functions on Confm ASpin2n+2 in a slightly diﬀerent

way. Recall that Spin2n+2 is associated to the Dynkin diagram Dn+1:

142

Figure 36 Dn Dynkin diagram

This diagram has an order two automorphism that gives an outer automorphism of Spin2n+2
of order two. Under this map, the ﬂag given by the sequence of vectors v1, v2, . . . v2n+2 gets
sent to the ﬂag given by the sequence of vectors

v1, v2, . . . , vn, vn+2, vn+1, vn+3, . . . , v2n+2.

In other words, the vectors vn+1 and vn+2 switch places.

The existence of this automorphism of Spin2n+2 means that there is a second map

Confm ASpin2n+2 → Conf m ASL2n+2.

We can also pull back functions from Conf m ASL2n+2 under this second map. We do not get
any new functions in this way, but we will often get simpler expressions for our functions in
this way. Thus the functions we consider will involve the volume forms v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vi as well as
the volume form

v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vn ∧ vn+2.

5.1. Construction of the seed. We are now ready to construct the seed for the cluster
structure on Confm A when G = Spin2n+2. Throughout this section, G = Spin2n+2 unless
otherwise noted.
The nodes of the diagram correspond to n+1 roots that all have the same length. To describe
the cluster structure on Conf3 A, we need to give the following data: the set I parameterizing
vertices, the functions on Conf3 A corresponding to each vertex, and the B-matrix for this seed.
The B-matrix is encoded via a quiver which consists of n2 + 3n + 2 vertices, all of which
have di = 1. We color all the vertices black. There are n + 1 edge functions for each edge of
the triangle, and n2 − 1 face functions. The entries of the B-matrix are ±1, and an arrow from
i to j means that bij > 0.
In Figure 37a, we see the quiver for Spin8. The generalization for other values of n should

be clear.

A dotted arrow means that bij = ± 1

For simplicity, all future diagrams will only contain the vertices xin and yn, and not the

vertices xin∗ and yn∗, which merely double them.

We will no longer use single letters like i, j to denote vertices of the quiver, because it will
be convenient for us to use the pairs (i, j) to parameterize the vertices of the quiver. In the
formulas in the remainder of this section, we will not refer to the particular entries of the B-
matrix, bij. Instead, the values of the entries of the B-matrix will be encoded in quivers. This
will hopefully avoid any notational confusion.

Label the vertices of the quiver xij and yk, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, n∗,
k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, n∗. The vertices yk and xij for i = 0 or n are frozen. We will sometimes
write xi,j for xij for orthographic reasons. Note that the dotted arrows only go between frozen
vertices, thus the entries bij of the B-matrix are integral unless i and j are both frozen, and
thus the B-matrix deﬁnes a cluster algebra.

Let us now recall some facts about the representation theory of Spin2n+2. The fundamental
representations of Spin2n+2 are labelled by the fundamental weights ω1, . . . , ωn, ωn∗. Spin2n+2
has a standard 2n + 1-dimensional representation V . Let < −,− > be the orthogonal pairing.
Vωn , Vωn∗ are the spin representations of Spin2n+2. When n is even, the spin representations
are dual to each other. When n is odd, the spin representations are self-dual. The the direct

Then for i < n the representation Vωi corresponding to ωi is preciselyVi V . The representations

146

We now say which functions are attached to the vertices of the quiver. Recall the functions
deﬁned via the webs from Figures 3, 4, and 6. It will be convenient to describe the functions
attached to xij for j ≤ n − 1 and yk for k ≤ n − 1 ﬁrst:

sum of the representations V2ωn∗ and V2ωn is isomorphic toVn+1 V , and Vωn+ωn∗ is isomorphic
toVn V .
2n + 2 − k!(−1)k = 2n + 2 − k
(1) For k ≤ n − 1, assign the function 
n + 2 + i − j !(−1)n−i to xij .
(2) When i ≥ j, assign the function  n − i
(3) When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function n − i, 2n + 2 + i − j
(4) When i = 0, we assign the function 2n + 2 − j

!(−1)n−i to xij .

j! to xij .

Now, when j or k are equal to n or n∗, the story is somewhat more complicated. As in
the case of Spin2n+1, the functions involve square-roots. But then there are two additional
complications: ﬁrst, we will need to slightly modify some of the functions which we previously
deﬁned in order to deal with the fact that there are two spin representations of Spin2n+2; and
second, the somewhat diﬀerent behavior of these spin representations for n odd and n even
means we will need to treat these cases separately.

Recall that in Figure 3, we deﬁned functions of the form  a, b
deﬁne some new functions of the form  a, b

!. We will now need to

function on the space of conﬁgurations of three principal ﬂags for the group Spin2n+2. Suppose
these ﬂags are given in terms of the three ﬂags

u1, . . . , uN ;

v1, . . . , vN ;
w1, . . . , wN ;

where N = 2n + 2.

Now consider the forms

The function a, b

Ua := u1 ∧ ··· ∧ ua,

!, except

n + 1

everywhere where one had Wn+1 := w1 ∧ ··· ∧ wn ∧ wn+1, one replaces this by Wn+1∗ :=
w1 ∧ ··· ∧ wn ∧ wn+2.

Thus there is a natural map

Applying these maps to the ﬁrst and second factors of φa+c−N,N −a(Vc), respectively, and then
multiplying, we get get the value of our function. This is a function on Conf 3 ASLN which pulls
back to a function on Conf3 ASpinN .
Recall that there is an outer automorphism of the group Spin2n+2. On the level of ﬂags, this
automorphism takes the n + 1-form Wn+1 to the n + 1-form Wn+1∗. All the new functions we
will need to deﬁne the cluster algebra structure on Conf 3 ASpinN will involve taking a previously
deﬁned function and substituting n+1∗ for n+1 for some subset of the arguments. For example,

We will distinguish two cases: n even or n odd. First suppose n is even. Then we assign

This completely describes the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 . The fact that we can take
the square-roots of the functions assigned to xin and yn and get functions that are well-deﬁned
on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 follows from the computations with reduced words that we perform later.
Note that the cluster structure is not symmetric with respect to the three ﬂags. Performing
various S3 symmetries, we obtain six diﬀerent possible cluster structures on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 .
These six structures are related by sequences of mutations that we describe in the next section.
Below, in Figure 38, we depict two of the cluster structures for Conf3 ASpin12 obtained from
our original cluster structure by an S3 symmetry.

Figure 38b. Another cluster structures
for Conf 3 ASpin10 related by to the
ﬁrst by an S3 symmetry.

Let us describe in more detail how to obtain these other cluster structures. If the S3 symmetry
is a rotation, we just rotate the quiver. If the S3 symmetry is a transposition, we transpose the
quiver and also reverse the arrows.

Unlike the cases of G = Sp2n and G = Spin2n+1, the functions attached to the vertices
do not come from permuting the arguments in our notation for the function. Permuting the
arguments only gives the correct functions up to a sign. This can be seen in the examples
above. This is important enough that we will discuss this separately in the next section.

The cluster structure for Confm A comes from triangulating an m-gon and then attaching the
cluster structure on Conf3 A to each triangle and then using the procedure of amalgamation.

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

151

As before, the vertices yk, x0j and xnj will lie on the edges of the triangle, and the functions
attached to them are edge functions. On Conf 3 A the edge vertices are frozen, and the functions
attached to these edges depend on only two of the three ﬂags. All other functions are face
functions.

To form the quiver for Conf m ASpin2n+2 , we ﬁrst take a triangulation of an m-gon. On each
of the m− 2 triangles, attach any one of the six quivers formed from performing S3 symmetries
on the quiver for Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 . Each edge of each of these triangles has n frozen vertices.
For any two triangles sharing an edge, the corresponding vertices on those edges are identiﬁed.
Those vertices become unfrozen.

If vertices i and j are glued with i′ and j′ to get new vertices i′′ and j′′, then we declare that

bi′′j′′ = bij + bi′j′ .

In other words, two dotted arrows in the same direction glue to give us a solid arrow, whereas
two dotted arrows in the opposite direction cancel to give us no arrow. One can easily check
that, again, any gluing will result in no dotted arrows using the unfrozen vertices. The arrows
involving vertices that were not previously frozen remain the same. Figure 39 below shows one
gluing between two triangles for Spin8. As will be the case in the remainder of the paper,
doubled vertices are not shown.

5.2. Signs and spin representations. In this section, we discuss in detail the signs involved
in deﬁning the cluster variables for Confm ASpin2n+2 . This is a somewhat delicate issue, and
can certainly be ignored on a ﬁrst reading. For the remainder of the paper, we would like to
ignore sign issues, on the one hand, for the sake of simplicity, and on the other hand, to avoid
having to treat the diﬀerent cases that, as our calculations become more complex, ultimately
will depend on the value of n mod 4. Instead of keeping track of all these signs, we will give a
framework for computing them.

In deﬁning the various functions we have used, like  a, b

c

!, we have been careful to

d

deﬁne them so that they would be positive functions on Confm ASLn , Confm ASp2n , and
Conf m ASpin2n+1 . Unfortunately, these functions are sometimes positive and sometimes nega-
tive on Conf m ASpin2n+2 . Moreover, as we saw above, the sign of these functions also depends
on the parity n. As we will see, if we additionally look at the rotations of these functions, the

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

153

signs will depend on n mod 4. The divergence of all these cases is reﬂection of Bott periodicity.
We will attempt to clarify the situation by isolating the various diﬃculties and dealing with
them separately.

There are two main diﬃculties. The ﬁrst source of complication is that the functions we have
deﬁned are well-adapted to computations in SLN . In types B and C, the maps Sp2n ֒→ SL2n
and Spin2n+1 → SL2n+1 come from folding of the Dynkin diagrams, and therefore preserve
positive structures. However, in type D, this is not the case. The map Spin2n+2 → SL2n+2
does not preserve positive structures, i.e., the pull-back of a positive function on Conf m ASL2n+2
is not necessarily positive on Confm ASpin2n+2 .
The second issue is the twisted cyclic shift map, which behaves diﬀerently for SL2n+2 and
Spin2n+2. In the following, we will usually let N = 2n + 2, but we will also allow N to be odd
for sake of comparison, and to also emphasize the relationship with Bott periodicity.

Let us consider functions of the form a, b

where T is the twisted cyclic shift map for SLN . This allowed us to deﬁne functions in a cluster
coming from a rotation of our original cluster.

Suppose we have the functions for a given cluster on Conf3 ASpinN . If we want to give the
functions in the cluster coming from a rotation of the original cluster, we must pull back by the
twisted cyclic shift map for SpinN . However, the elements sG for G = SpinN and G = SLN
are not necessarily the same. In fact, sSpinN ∈ SpinN is the nontrivial lift of the identity in
SON when

and sSpinN is the identity when

N ≡ 3, 4, 5, 6 mod 8

N ≡ 0, 1, 2, 7 mod 8.

Here is one way of determining when sSpinN is the identity. Let ρ be the half-sum of the

highest weight of the spin representation, and sSpinN is the identity when < ωn, 2ρ > is even
and the non-trivial lift of the identity when < ωn, 2ρ > is odd.

identity element when N is odd.

On the other hand, sSLN ∈ SLN is negative of the identity element when N is even and the
(Under the embedding Sp2n ֒→ SL2n, sSp2n is sent to sSL2n. Under the map Spin2n+1 →
SL2n+1, the element sSpin2n+1 is sent to sSL2n+1. Note that in the latter case, sSpin2n+1 is some
lift of the identity in SO2n+1, while sSL2n+1 is the identity in SL2n+1.)

Let us compare what the elements sSpinN and sSLN do on the level of ﬂags. Let N = 2n + 2
be even. Suppose we have a principal aﬃne ﬂag A ∈ ASpinN . Then this ﬂag is given an SLN
ﬂag given by a chain of vector spaces

V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ ··· ⊂ VN

154

IAN LE

with volume forms on each of these subspaces. Note that the spaces V1, . . . , Vn+1 along with
their volume forms determine the rest of the ﬂag. This ﬂag can be represented by the sequence
of vectors v1, v2, . . . , vN , where Vi has volume form v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vi. Additionally, to make
this a SpinN ﬂag, we choose a “square-root” of the form v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn+1, which is given by
choosing a highest weight vector in the spin representation Vωn . This then forces a choice of a
“square-root” of the form v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn ∧ vn+2, given by a highest weight vector in the spin
representation Vωn∗ .

Now sSLN acts by −1 on V , so

sSLN (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vi) = (−1)iv1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vi.

On the other hand, sSpinN acts by 1 on V , so

sSpinN (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vi) = v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vi.

However, in the cases where sSpinN is a non-trivial element (N ≡ 4, 6 mod 8), it acts by −1
on the spin representations.
More generally, the functions on ASpinN are naturally isomorphic to the direct sum of its

irreducible representations:

Mλ∈Λ+

Vλ.

The representations come in two types: those that factor through SON , and those that don’t.
sSpinN acts by 1 on the former and ±1 on the latter, depending on N mod 8.

Applying the twisted cyclic shift will give a function in the space

[Vωn ⊗ Vωn−i ⊗ Vωn ]SpinN .

In the twisted cyclic shift, one factor of Vωn , which is a spin representation, is moved from the
third slot to the ﬁrst slot. The twisted cyclic shift will then act by −1 on this factor when
N ≡ 4, 6 mod 8.
Similarly, when we want to ﬁnd the cluster structure corresponding to a transposition, then
transposing the arguments only gives the correct function up to a sign. We showed the correct
signs for the functions for one of the transpositions of the cluster structure in Figure 38. The
negative signs, instead of occuring in every other row, occur here on every other lower diagonal.
This pattern persists in general. The signs for other transpositions come from applying the
twisted cyclic shift map to this cluster.

Finally, we would like to say something about square-roots. Some of our functions on
Conf m ASpinN were deﬁned in terms of square-roots of other functions. This happens when a
function lies in an invariant space where two or more of the representations involved is a spin
representation. We would like to pick out the correct square-root. In order to do this, we will
need a way to describe vectors in these invariant spaces. In the following, we will treat both
the cases when N = 2n + 1 is even and when N = 2n is odd.

We start by recalling some facts about spin representations. Let V be an N -dimensional
vector space with a non-degenerate quadratic form Q(−,−). From such data, we can form the
Cliﬀord algebra C(V ). It is the quotient of the free tensor algebra on V by the relation

v ⊗ w + w ⊗ v = 2Q(v, w).

Let W ⊂ V be as maximal isotropic subspace. It has dimenions n. LetV• W be the exterior
algebra of W . C(V ) and V• W have a natural Z/2Z-grading that comes from considering

elements of V to be odd.

Then when N = 2n is even,

Moreover,

Let us describe the action of C(V ) on V• W . Write V ≃ W ⊕ W ′, where W ′ is an isotropic

subspace complementary to W . Then w ∈ W acts as

Recall that the lie algebra soN ≃V2 V of SpinN can be embedded in C(V ) as the span of
tations of soN ⊂ Ceven(V ): Veven W andVodd W . These are precisely the spin representations
of SpinN . When n is even,Veven W has highest weight ωn andVodd W has highest weight ωn∗.
If n is odd,Veven W has highest weight ωn∗ andVodd W has highest weight ωn.
When N is odd, we get one spin representation, given byV• W.

Now we are ready to deﬁne invariants in tensor products of representations. First we will

Let N = 2n be even. Let us write down bases for the spin representations. First choose
a basis e1, . . . , e2n where Q(ei, e2n+1−i) = (−1)i−1 for i ≤ n. Then there is a maximal torus
consisting of diagonal elements that preserve Q. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a cocharacter
given by sending λ ∈ C∗ to the map which takes ei to λei and e2n+1−i to λ−1e2n+1−i and
leaves all other basis elements ﬁxed. These n cocharacters form a basis for the Cartan h.
There is a dual basis L1, . . . , Ln of h∗. We may let W be the span of e1, . . . , en. Then if
I = {i1, i2, . . . , ik} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} where i1 < i2 < ··· < ik, then let

eI := ei1 ∧ eı2 ∧ ··· ∧ eik .

Then eI has weight

First suppose n is even. We will then deﬁne a pairing φ : Vωn × Vωn → C. Then let

unless I and J are complementary subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, in which case

eI , eJ ∈ Veven W . If I and J are subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, then we will declare φ(eI , eJ ) = 0
Similarly, we have a pairing φ : Vωn∗ × Vωn∗ → C. Then let eI, eJ ∈Vodd W . If I and J are

subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, then we will declare φ(eI , eJ ) = 0 unless I and J are complementary
subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, in which case

φ(eI , eJ ) = (−1)<ωn−ωI ,2ρ>.

φ(eI , eJ ) = (−1)<ωn∗ −ωI ,2ρ>.

Now suppose n is odd. We can then deﬁne a pairing φ : Vωn×Vωn∗ → C. Then let eIVeven W
and eJ ∈Vodd W . If I and J are subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, then we will declare φ(eI , eJ ) = 0

unless I and J are complementary subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, in which case

φ(eI , eJ ) = (−1)<ωn−ωI ,2ρ>.

Similarly, we have a pairing φ : Vωn∗ × Vωn → C. Then let eI ∈Vodd W and eJ ∈Veven W .

If I and J are subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, then we will declare φ(eI , eJ ) = 0 unless I and J are
complementary subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}, in which case

φ(eI , eJ ) = (−1)<ωn∗ −ωI ,2ρ>.

Then φ in all the above cases gives an invariant of the tensor product of two spin represen-

tations. This gives correct square-roots for functions of the formp(n; n),p(n∗; n∗),p(n; n∗)
andp(n∗; n), respectively.

Now let N = 2n+1 be odd. Here, we may choose a basis e1, . . . , e2n+1 where Q(ei, e2n+2−i) =
(−1)i−1 for i ≤ n. Then there is a maximal torus consisting of diagonal elements that preserve
Q. For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, there is a cocharacter given by sending λ ∈ C∗ to the map which
takes ei to λei and e2n+2−i to λ−1e2n+1−i and leaves all other basis elements ﬁxed. These n
cocharacters form a basis for the Cartan h. There is a dual basis L1, . . . , Ln of h∗. We may let
W be the span of e1, . . . , en. Then if I = {i1, i2, . . . , ik} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} where i1 < i2 < ··· < ik,
then let

This deﬁnes the correct square-root for the functionp(n; n + 1)

Finally, let S1 and S2 be two spin representations of SpinN , where N = 2n or 2n + 1. Let

[Vωk ⊗ S1 ⊗ S2]SpinN .

We can do this for simultaneously for N even or odd. We will do this by constructing a
SpinN -invariant map

to itself k is even, and gives a map from one spin representation to the other one when k is odd.

When k is even or odd,Vk V maps to Ceven(V ) or Codd(V ), respectively. Thus in the case when
N is even, an element ofVk V , viewed inside C(V ), gives a map from each spin representation
(When N is odd an element ofVk V always gives a map from the unique spin representation

to itself.) Then if we have v ⊗ s1 ⊗ s2 ∈ Vωk ⊗ S1 ⊗ S2, we can map this to φs1, v · s2 in the
instances where v · s2 lies in the spin representation dual to S1 (which depends on k, etc.).

(The presence of the superscripts ∗ will depend on the parities of k and n, while the sign
under the radical will depend on the presence of the superscripts ∗.)
From now on, we will suppress all signs for the sake of simplicity in all our future computa-
tions. The analysis above allows the interested reader to supply signs for all the functions that
arise in the mutations that follow.
5.3. Folding. Let us now discuss how the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+2 comes from an unfolding
for the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 . From the description above, it is clear that there is an
automorphism σ of the quiver for the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 . Namely,
we can deﬁne

σ(xin) = xin∗
σ(xin∗) = xin
σ(yn) = xn∗
σ(yn∗) = xn

and σ ﬁxes all other vertices. Then folding the quiver under the automorphism σ gives the
quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 .
Let us say this in another way. Let σ be the Dynkin diagram automorphism of Dn+1
having quotient Bn. Then σ induces a map on the root system for Spin2n+2, and hence on
the fundamental weights and the dominant weights. It also induces an outer automorphism of
Spin2n+2 having ﬁxed locus Spin2n+1, and an involution on the spaces Conf m ASpin2n+1 . Let
π be the map from the vertices of Dn+1 to the vertices of Bn. This induces a map π sending
fundamental weights to corresponding fundamental weights, and therefore projects the weight
space for Spin2n+2 to the weight space for Spin2n+1.

It turns out that the cluster algebra structure on Conf 3 ASL2n is preserved by this involution,
and that, moreover, the initial seed that we constructed above is preserved by this involution.
Folding this seed gives the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 .
Observation 5.2. Let f be a function on Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 that lies in the invariant space

Then σ∗(f ) lies in the invariant space

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]Spin2n+2 .

[Vσ(λ) ⊗ Vσ(µ) ⊗ Vσ(ν)]Spin2n+2 .

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]SL2n.

Observation 5.3. Let f be a function on Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 that lies in the invariant space

Then as a function on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 , f lies in the invariant space

[Vπ(λ) ⊗ Vπ(µ) ⊗ Vπ(ν)]Spin2n+1 .

Observation 5.4. Consider our initial cluster for Conf3 ASpin2n+2 . Suppose v is a vertex in
the quiver for this cluster. Let fv is the function attached to v. Then

fv ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν]Spin2n+2 ,

fσ(v) ∈ [Vσ(λ) ⊗ Vσ(µ) ⊗ Vσ(ν)]Spin2n+2 .

However, on Conf3 ASpin2n+1 , fv = fσ(v). This means that we must have π(λ) = π(σ(λ)),
π(µ) = π(σ(µ)), and π(ν) = π(σ(ν)).

As we mutate the cluster for Conf3 ASpin2n+1 , we continue to get clusters that unfold to give
clusters for Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 . We will later give sequences of mutations that realize various S3
symmetries for the cluster algebra on Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 , and also the ﬂip on Conf4 ASpin2n+2 . All
these sequences of mutations will just be unfoldings of the analogous sequence of mutations for
Conf 3 ASpin2n+1 or Conf4 ASpin2n+1 . This gives us the following principle which will underlie
the computations of the S3 symmetries on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 and the ﬂip on Conf4 ASpin2n+2 :
Observation 5.5. We can compute the formulas for the cluster variables on Conf3 ASpin2n+2
and Conf4 ASpin2n+2 that appear at various stages of mutation in the following way: Start
with the formula for the corresponding cluster variable on Confm ASpin2n+1 . Replace every
instance of “a” where 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1 by “a,” and replace every instance of “2n + 1 − a” where
1 ≤ a ≤ n− 1 by “2n + 2− a.” Every instance of “n” should be replaced by either “n,” “n + 1,”
or “n + 1∗,” depending on the context. One then obtains the formula for the cluster variable
on Confm ASpin2n+2 .

All the formulas we derive for Spin2n+2 will follow this principle.
Finally, because any two vertices that are identiﬁed under the folding of cluster variables
(for example xin and xin∗ ) are exchanged under the involution σ, we have that the formulas
for computing the functions attached to these vertices obeys another principle:

Observation 5.6. Suppose we have a cluster that is ﬁxed under the involution σ. (This is the
case for our initial cluster and any cluster obtained from the initial one in which whenever we
mutate a vertex v we also mutate σ(v).) Then if v is a vertex in this cluster, the formula for
fσ(v) is obtained from the formula for fv by switching all occurences of n + 1 and n + 1∗.

Finally, let us brieﬂy say something about folding on the level of reduced words in the Weyl
group. We will see in the next section that the cluster algebra structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+2
comes from the longest word in the Weyl group for Spin2n+2. Let the generators for this Weyl
group be s1, s2, . . . , sn−1, sn, sn∗. Then the longest element of the Weyl group is

Let s′

1, s′

2, . . . , s′

n be the generators for the Weyl group of Spin2n+1. There is an injection

(s′

ns′

n−1 . . . s′

from the Weyl group of Spin2n+1 to the Weyl group of Spin2n+2 that takes

s′
n → snsn∗,
s′
i → si.

This map carries the longest element of the Weyl group of Spin2n+1 to the longest element of
the Weyl group of Spin2n+2:
(s′

ns′

n−1 . . . s′

1)n → (snsn∗sn−1sn−2 . . . s1)n

Therefore the reduced word for the longest element of the Weyl group of Spin2n+2 folds to give
the reduced word for the longest element of the Weyl group of Spin2n+1, and the folding that
gives the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASp2n from the cluster structure on Conf 3 ASL2n really
takes place on the level of Weyl groups.

5.4. Reduced words. We now relate the cluster structure on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 given in the
previous section to Berenstein, Fomin and Zelevinsky’s cluster structure on B, the Borel in the
group G ([BFZ]). This will allow us to see that the cluster structure described above induces
a positive structure on AG,S identical to the one given in [FG1]. For a reader not interested in
the positive structure on AG,S, and more interested in just understanding the cluster structure
on AG,S, this section is not logically necessary.

160

As before, we will restrict our attention to triples of principal ﬂags of the form (U −, w0U −, b·

w0U −). Consider the map

i : b ∈ B− → (U −, w0U −, b · w0U −) ∈ Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 .

Let us recall the constructions of [BFZ]. For u, v elements of the Weyl group W of G, we

have the double Bruhat cell

The cell Gw0,e is the on open part of B−.

Gu,v = B+ · u · B+ ∩ B− · v · Bv.

Proposition 5.7. The cluster algebra constructed above on Conf3 ASpin2n+2 , when restricted
to the image of i, coincides with the cluster algebra structure given in [BFZ] on B− = Gw0,e.

Proof. Gw0,e is the on open part of B−. Following [BFZ], to get a cluster structure on this
subset, we must choose a reduced-word for w0. In the numbering of the nodes of the Dynkin
diagram given above for Spin2n+2, we choose the reduced word expression

w0 = (snsn∗ sn−1 ··· s2s1)n.

Here our convention is that the above word corresponds to the string i1, i2, . . . , in−1, in∗ , in
repeated n times.

Now let G0 = U −HU + ⊂ G be the open subset of elements of G having Gaussian decompo-
sition x = [x]−[x]0[x]+. Then for any two elements u, v ∈ W , and any fundamental weight ωi,
we have the generalized minor ∆uωi,vωi(x) deﬁned by

∆uωi,vωi (x) := ([u−1xv]0)ωi .

In our situation, we are interested in such minors when u, v = e, or when v = e and

u = uij = (snsn∗sn−1 ··· s2s1)i−1snsn∗ sn−1 ··· sj for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and n ≥ j ≥ 1 or j = n∗.
functions associated to u, v = e), and

Then the cluster functions on B− given in [BFZ] are ∆ωi,ωi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n (these are the

∆uij ωj ,ωj ,

which are the functions associated to v = e and u = uij = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)isnsn−1 ··· sj. Note
that uij is the subword of u that stops on the ith iteration of sj.

We have the following claims:

q±(n − i, n + 2 + i; n + 1(∗); n + 1) = ∆uinωn,ωn
q±(n − i, n + 2 + i; n + 1(∗); n + 1∗) = ∆uin∗ ωn∗ ,ωn∗ .

Thus, in all cases the function assigned to xij is precisely ∆uij ωj ,ωj .
The proof of these claims is a straightforward calculation.
It is convenient to ﬁx maps Spin2n+2 ։ SO2n+2 ֒→ SL2n+2. Choose the quadratic form so
that < ei, e2n+3−i >= (−1)i−1 and all other pairings of basis elements are zero. Now choose a
pinning such that under the map Spin2n+2 ֒→ SL2n+2,

Eαn = En,n+2 + En+1,n+3, Fαn = En+2,n + En+3,n+1,
Eαn∗ = En,n+1 + En+2,n+3, Fαn = En+1,n + En+3,n+2,

and for 1 ≤ i < n,

Eαi = Ei,i+1 + E2n+2−i,2n+3−i, Fαi = Ei+1,i + E2n+3−i,2n+2−i,

were Ei,j is the (i, j)-elementary matrix, i.e., the matrix with a 1 in the (i, j) position and 0 in
all other positions. This map does not preserve positive structures.

With respect to this embedding, we can directly calculate ∆ωj ,ωj (x) where x ∈ B−. When x
is embedded in SL2n+2, ∆ωj ,ωj (x) is simply the determinant of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst
j rows and the ﬁrst j columns for j < n, ∆ωn+ωn∗ ,ωn+ωn∗ (x) is the determinant of the minor
consisting of the ﬁrst n rows and columns, ∆ωn,ωn (x) is the square-root of the determinant of
the minor consisting of the ﬁrst n + 1 rows and columns, and

∆ωn∗ ,ωn∗ (x) = ∆ωn+ωn∗ ,ωn+ωn∗ (x)/∆ωn,ωn (x).

∆ωn∗ ,ωn∗ (x) = σ∗(∆ωn,ωn (x)).

Similarly, one calculates that ∆uij ωj ,ωj (x) only depends on the entries in rows n + i + 2, n +
i + 1, . . . , n + 3, 1, 2, . . . n − i as well as rows n + 2 and n + 1 and the ﬁrst n + 2 columns. In
particular, for j < n, ∆uij ωj,ωj (x) is the determinant of the minor consisting of the ﬁrst j of
those rows (in the order listed above) and the ﬁrst j columns. We also have that

∆ui,n−1(ωn+ωn∗ ),ωn+ωn∗ (x) = ∆uin(ωn+ωn∗ ),ωn+ωn∗ (x) = ∆uin∗ (ωn+ωn∗ ),ωn+ωn∗ (x)

is the determinant of the minor consisting of the n rows n+ i + 2, n+ i + 1, . . . , n+ 3, 1, 2, . . . n− i
and the ﬁrst n columns.
Meanwhile, ∆uinωn,ωn(x) is calculated by taking the square-root of the minor consisting of
the rows n + i + 2, n + i + 1, . . . , n + 3, 1, 2, . . . n − i as well as either row n + 2 (if i is odd)
or n + 1 (if i is even) and the ﬁrst n + 1 columns. ∆uin∗ ωn∗ ,ωn∗ (x) can be calculated in one
of two ways: using the quotient ∆uin∗ ωn∗ ,ωn∗ (x) = ∆uin∗ (ωn+ωn∗ ),ωn+ωn∗ (x)/∆uin∗ ωn,ωn(x), or
by applying σ to ∆uinωn,ωn(x), so that it is the square-root of the minor consisting of the rows
n + i + 2, n + i + 1, . . . , n + 3, 1, 2, . . . n − i as well as either row n + 2 (if i is even) or n + 1 (if i
is odd) and the columns 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 2.

(which gave the S3 symmetry for G = Sp2n and Spin2n+1):

The sequence can be thought of as follows: At any step of the process, we mutate all xij
such that max(i, j) is constant. It will not matter in which order we mutate these xij because
the vertices we mutate have no arrows between them. So we ﬁrst mutate the xij such that
max(i, j) = 1, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 2, then the xij such that max(i, j) = 3, etc.
The sequence of maximums that we use is

1, 2, 3, . . . n − 1, 1, 2, . . . n − 2 . . . , 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.

The evolution of the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+2 is just as in the case for Conf3 ASp2n , as
pictured in Figures 13 and 14, with the only diﬀerence being that each white vertex is replaced
by two black vertices.

In Figure 40, we depict how the quiver for Conf3 ASpin10 changes after performing the

sequence of mutations of xij having maximums 1; 1, 2; and 1, 2, 3.

Note that in Figure 40c, we have changed which of the doubled vertices shown. This is
because mutation of vertices adjacent to the doubled vertices changes how they are connected
to each other. It is not diﬃcult to see that we end up with the functions and quiver as depicted.
In Figure 41, we depict the state of the quiver after performing the sequence of mutations of

Figure 41b The quiver and the func-

From these diagrams the various quivers in the general case of Conf3 ASpin2n+2 should be

clear.

Theorem 5.8. If max(i, j) = k, then xij is mutated a total of n − k times.

Recall that when i ≥ j, we assign the function  n − i

n + 2 + i − j ! to xij . Thus the function

j

attached to xij transforms as follows:

n + 2 + i − j ! → 2n + 1, n − i − 1
  n − i

n + i − j + 3

j

! → 2n, n − i − 2

n + i − j + 4

When i < j and i 6= 0, we assign the function  n − i, 2n + 2 + i − j

n + 3

j

→ j − i + 1, n + i + 3

Proof. The proof is identical to the case where G = Sp2n. Note that we do note mutate any of
the vertices that have square-roots. However, the functions with square-roots are involved in
the mutations, as we mutate vertices adjacent to them, namely, the vertices xi,n−1.

We then need to use that

Both these identities are a consequence of the fact that

∆uin∗ ωn∗ ,ωn∗ (x) · ∆uin∗ ωn,ωn(x) = ∆uin∗ (ωn+ωn∗ ),ωn+ωn∗ (x).

Using these identities, we reduce all the mutation identities to those appearing in the cactus

sequence.

(cid:3)

The above sequence of mutations takes us from one seed for the cluster algebra structure on
Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 to another seed where the roles of the second and third principal ﬂags have
been reversed. Thus, we have realized the ﬁrst of the transpositions necessary to construct all
the S3 symmetries of Conf3 ASpin2n+2 .

5.4.2. The second transposition. Let us now give the sequence of mutations that realizes that
S3 symmetry (A, B, C) → (C, B, A).

170

IAN LE

The sequence of mutations is as in the case of Sp2n, (8):

(17)

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ , xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−2,n∗ , xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, xn−3,n∗ ,

. . . , x1,2, . . . , x1,n, x1,n∗

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ , xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−2,n∗ , xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, xn−3,n∗ ,

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ , xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−2,n∗ , xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, xn−3,n∗ ,

. . . , x2,3, . . . , x2,n, . . . , x2,n∗ ,

. . . , x3,4, . . . , x3,n, . . . , x3,n∗ ,

. . .

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ , xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−2,n∗ , xn−3,n−2, xn−3,n−1, xn−3,n, xn−3,n∗ ,

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ , xn−2,n−1, xn−2,n, xn−2,n∗ ,

xn−1,n, xn−1,n∗ ,

The sequence can be thought of as follows: We only mutate those xij with i < j. At any
step of the process, we mutate all xij in the kth row (the kth row consists of xij such that i = k)
such that i < j (we will consider that n − 1 < n and n − 1 < n∗). It will not matter in which
order we mutate these xij . The sequence of rows that we mutate is

n − 1, n − 2 . . . , 2, 1n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 2, n, . . . , 3, . . . , n − 1, n − 2, n − 1.

As in the previous transposition, the evolution of the quiver for Conf3 ASpin2n+2 is just as
in the cases for Conf3 ASp2n and Conf3 ASpin2n+1 , as pictured in Figures 15 and 16, with the
only diﬀerence being that black and white vertices switch colors.
In Figure 42, we depict how the quiver for Conf3 ASpin12 changes after performing the se-

quence of mutations of xij in rows 4; 4, 3; 4, 3, 2; and 4, 3, 2, 1.

These functions are invariants (unique up to scale) of the tensor products

For j = n or n∗, the mutation sequence is similar, but a bit more subtle, and depends on
whether n − i is odd or even. First note that the functions attached to xin and xin∗ involve
square-roots. Let us ﬁrst consider xin. We have the following cases:

• If n is even and i is odd, then the square of the function attached to xin transforms as

follows:

 n − i, n + i + 2

 n − i + 2, n + i

Proof. We have already described the quivers at the various stages of mutation. We must then
check that the functions above satisfy the identities of the associated cluster transformations.
This is the ﬁrst sequence of mutations where we have to mutate the vertices xin and xin∗ .

The mutation of these vertices is the most diﬃcult to handle.

We will need the following facts, which are analogous to the previous facts used for the case

of Spin2n+2. Let N = 2n + 2:

The ﬁrst ﬁve identities can be proved by the same method as we used for G = Sp2n and

N = 2n. The last identity can be reduced to (16).

All cluster mutations of xij , j < n are obtained as before: they are either the ﬁrst identity
in the above list, or they are degenerations of this identity, and are obtained from the ﬁrst one
by applying one of the remaining identities.

The mutation of the vertices xin and xin∗ requires some more work. We will also make use

of functions of the form

 a, b

x, y

!

c, d

where x, y = n + 1 or n + 1∗, and a + b + c + d = 2N . We again use the webs pictured in Figure
17*.

The most general identity takes diﬀerent forms depending on the parity of n, i and j. For

example, we need to show:

n + 1, n + 1∗

n + 1∗, n + 1

vuut n − i, n + 2 + i
vuut n + 1 − i, n + 1 + i
vuut n − i, n + 2 + i
vuut n + 1 − i, n + 1 + i

5.5. The sequence of mutations for a ﬂip. In this section, we will give a sequence of
mutations that relates two of the clusters coming from diﬀerent triangulations of the 4-gon.
Combined with the previous section, this allows us to connect by mutations all 72 diﬀerent
clusters we have constructed for Conf4 ASpin2n+2 .
Given a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) ∈ Conf4 ASpin2n+2 , we will give a sequence of mutations
that relates a cluster coming from the triangulation ABC, ACD to a cluster coming from the
triangulation ABD, BCD.

We will need to relabel the quiver with vertices xij , yk, with −n ≤ i ≤ n, j = 1, 2, . . . , n −

with is as in Figure 44, pictured for Spin8. We don’t picture the vertices xin∗ , which double
the vertices xin, or the vertices yn∗ and y−n∗ , which double the vertices yn and y−n.

The functions above are deﬁned by pulling back via the various natural maps

p1, p2, p3, p4 : Conf4 ASpin2n+2 → Conf 3 ASpin2n+2

that map a conﬁguration (A, B, C, D) to (B, C, D), (A, C, D), (A, B, D), (A, B, C), respectively.
Pulling back functions from Conf 3 ASpin2n+2 allows us to deﬁne functions on Conf4 ASpin2n+2 .

There is also a map

The forgetful maps and twist maps, combined with the constructions below, will furnish all the
functions necessary for the computation of the ﬂip mutation sequence.

As in the cases of G = Sp2n and Spin2n+1, we will have to use some functions which depend
on all four ﬂags. Let N = 2n + 2. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ N such that a + b + c + d = 4n + 4 = 2N
and b + c ≤ N . Then we will deﬁne a function that we will call

The function on Conf 4 ASLN is given by an invariant in the space

[Vωa ⊗ Vωb ⊗ Vωc ⊗ Vωd ]SLN .

The function is given, as before, by the web in Figure 19.

We again use the symbol “:” because the function does not have cyclic symmetry. In other

words,

Instead, we use the notation

is a well-deﬁned function on Conf4 ASpin2n+2 . This is because the representations Vωa and Vωb
of SLN give the same representations of SpinN , and Vωx and Vωy , as representations of SpinN ,
have twice the weight of one of the spin representations. Thus, for example, when n is odd and
a + c is odd,

is a well-deﬁned function on Conf4 ASpin2n+2 .
Now we give the sequence of mutations realizing the ﬂip of a triangulation. The sequence
of mutations is a lift of the sequence of mutations for the cases of Sp2n and Spin2n+1. The
sequence of mutations leaves x−n,j, xnj , yk untouched as they are frozen variables. Hence we
only mutate xij for −n ≤ i ≤ n. We now describe the sequence of mutations. The sequence of
mutations will have 3n − 2 stages. At the rth step, we mutate all vertices such that

|i| + j ≤ r,

j − |i| + 2n − 2 ≥ r,
|i| + j ≡ r mod 2.

Note that the ﬁrst inequality is empty for r ≥ 2n − 1, while the second inequality is empty

for r ≤ n.
Remark 5.12. For the sake of the above inequalities, we n + 1∗ = n + 1, so that whenever we
mutate xin we will also mutate xin∗ . The vertices xin and xin∗ will not have arrows between
them in the quivers that are obtained in the stages of our mutation process, so they can be
mutated in any order.

For example, for Spin8, the sequence of mutations is

(19)

x01,

x−1,1, x02, x11,

x−2,1, x−1,2, x01, x03, x03∗ , x12, x21,

x−1,3, x−1,3, x02, x13, x13∗ ,

x03, x03∗ .

In Figure 45, we depict how the quiver for Conf4 ASpin8 changes after each of the seven

stages of mutation.

We now have the main theorem of this section:

Theorem 5.13. We ﬁrst analyze the situation when i > 0. The vertex xij is mutated a total
of n − i times. There are four cases.

• When i + j < n and i < j, the function attached to xij mutates in three stages,

consisting of n − i − j, i, and j − i mutations, respectively:

The proof of the mutation identities is much like when G = Sp2n. The ﬁrst three sets of
identities are the most important. They are variations on the octahedron recurrence. When
i + j < n and i < j, the three stages use the ﬁrst, second and third set of identities, respectively.
When i + j ≥ n and i < j 6= n, the two stages use the second and third set of identities,
respectively. When i + j < n and i ≥ j, the two stages use the ﬁrst and second set of identities,
respectively. When i + j ≥ n and i ≥ j, the one stage uses only the second set of identities.
The fourth through sixth identities are used to give degenerate versions of the previous three
sets of identities. The last set of identities is used when mutating vertices adjacent to xin or
xin∗ .

The main novelty occurs when mutating xij for j = n or n∗. We will handle the case when
j = n. Here we will need to derive some new identities. The general mutation identity when
j = n has one of the following forms.

Simply substitute each term on the left hand side of the last three identities with the cor-
responding term on the right-hand side into the ﬁrst identity. Cancelling will give the general
mutation identity. All other mutation identities for j = n come from this one using degeneracies.

6. The space XG,S

In this section, we explain how to derive the structure of a cluster X -variety on Confm BG.
In [FG2], the authors explain how to construct from a cluster A-variety the corresponding
X -variety. We have shown above that Confm AG is a cluster A-variety when G is a classical
group. We would like to show the following:

206

IAN LE

Theorem 6.1. Conf m BG has the structure of a cluster X -variety. This is the X -variety which
is attached, via the constructions of [FG2], to cluster structure that we have constructed on
Conf m AG.

Let us recall the constructions of [FG2] discussed in . Suppose we have a cluster A-variety
with seed Σ = (I, I0, B, d). Then for every non-frozen index i ∈ I, there is a cluster variable
Xi. There is a map from p : AΣ → XΣ given by

Let A be the cluster A-variety Conf 3 AG, and let Σ be the initial seed we constructed. Then
let us ﬁrst compute the functions p∗(Xi) and see that they descend to Conf3BG. Recall that all
the cluster functions Aj that we constructed on Conf3 AG were invariants of tensor products:

Now recall that G/U has a left action of H, the Cartan subgroup. The functions on G/U

Aj ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G.

decompose as

p∗(Xi) =Yj∈I

ABij

j

.

Mλ∈Λ+

Vλ.

[Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G

Moreover, h ∈ H acts on the summand Vλ by λ(h).

Correspondingly, on Conf3 AG there is an action of H 3, and (h1, h2, h3) acts on the summand

by

λ(h1)µ(h2)ν(h3).

From this action, it is easy to check case by case that the action of H 3 on p∗(Xi) is trivial.
In other words, the function p∗(Xi) descends to the quotient of Conf3 AG by H 3, which is
precisely Conf3 BG.
Now we must check that the torus XΣ is birational to Conf 3 BG. From the above, we clearly
have a map p′ : Conf3 BG → XΣ, so that all the functions Xi can be viewed as functions on
Conf 3 BG. We will show that they parameterize an open set in Conf3 BG.
To do this, we will adapt the results of [FG4] and [W] on parameterization of double Bruhat
cells Gu,v, applied to the particular Bruhat cell Gw0,e. Let us recall the setup. Recall that the
functions on Conf 3 AG were associated to a reduced word composition for w0. For the cases
where G = Sp2n, Spin2n+1, Spin2n+2, they were as follows:

w0,Sp2n = w0,Spin2n+1 = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)n.

The functions Aij attached to the vertices xij for i > 0 were associated to the subwords

w0,Spin2n+2 = (snsn∗ sn−1 ··· s2s1)n.

uij = (snsn−1 ··· s2s1)i−1snsn−1 ··· sj,

uij = (snsn∗ sn−1 ··· s2s1)i−1snsn∗sn−1 ··· sj.

Let Xij be the X -function attached to the vertex xij for 0 < i < n (the vertices xij for
i = 0 or n are frozen, so do not give variables on the X -space). It is known that there is a
parameterization of Conf 3 BG given by three ﬂags

(B+, u−B+, B−),

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

207

where u− is determined up to the adjoint action of H. Let b− be an element of B−. Then there
is a natural projection

π : B− → H = B/[B, B]
The choice of opposite ﬂags B+ and B− gives an inclusion

Then let

i : H → B−.

ρ(b−) := i(π(b−))−1b−.

This associates to each element of B− an element of U −. We will be interested in ρ(b−) up to
the adjoint action of H.

Then the co-ordinates Xij give a parameterization of u− by the following formula:

Thus the functions Xij give a parameterization of Conf3 BG.

Remark 6.2. Replacing the the B-matrix by its negation does nothing to change the A space,
but it replaces all the functions Xij on the X -space by their inverses. It is a matter of convention

have chosen, one would replace all the expressions Hω∨

Remark 6.3. A close reader will notice that our formulas diﬀer slightly from those found in
[FG1]. We correct here an error in that paper. The formulas in [FG1] give a factorization
of an element in B− in terms of snakes, which are deﬁned using intersections of subspaces
coming from a conﬁguration of three ﬂags. The resulting parameters X (which correspond to
our Xij) in their formulas are then calculated using snakes. However, the X-coordinates in
[FG1] are deﬁned in terms of projections onto various subspaces. Thus they are d ual to the
snake parameters. This explains the discrepancy above.

We then need to check that for any gluing of triangles to get a structure of an A-space
on Conf4 AG, the X -coordinates on the edge gluing the two triangles parameterize gluings of
In other words, there is an

equivalence

Conf 4 BG ≃ Conf3 BG × H × Conf 3 BG.

Let us examine the X -coordinates on the X -space corresponding to the A-space Conf4 AG. We
showed above that the face X -coordinates parameterize the two copies of Conf3 BG. Then we
need to see that the edge X coordinates parameterize H, the space of gluings.

208

IAN LE

Explicitly, we have that H acts by shearing the conﬁguration of four ﬂags in the following

way:

h : (B+, u−B+, B−, u+B−) → (B+, u−B+, B−, hu+B−).

It is then a simple matter to check that the edge X -coordinates a torsor for H. For simplicity,
let us consider the cluster structure on Conf4 AG for G = Sp2n with the vertices labelled as in
Figure 18: we have vertices xij , yk, with −n ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n and 1 ≤ |k| ≤ n. Then the
edge vertices are x0j . An easy calculation shows that

Proposition 6.4. An element h ∈ H acts on x0j by αj(h), where αj is the j-th simple root of
G′.

Note that because G′ is adjoint, the simple roots αj span the weight lattice.

Proof. The proof reduces to a computation. Suppose we have a conﬁguration of ﬂags

(B−, u+B−, B+, u−B+).

We can lift it to a conﬁguration in Conf 4 AG:

(U −, u+U −, U +, u−U +).

We can calculate the action of H on Conf4 G by lifting it to an action of H on Conf4 AG:

h : (U −, A1, U +, A2) → (U −, A1, hU +, hA2).

Then we can easily calculate how H acts on the functions on Conf4 AG. Conf4 AG is glued
from two copies of Conf3 AG, and the action on these two copies is as follows:

h : (U −, A1, U +) → (U −, A1, hU +).

h : (U −, U +, A2) → (U −, hU +, hA2) = (h−1U −, U +, A2).

Now the ring of functions on Conf3 AG has a triple-grading by dominant weights; there is a

grading by dominant weights for each ﬂag. Suppose we have a function

f ∈ [Vλ ⊗ Vµ ⊗ Vν ]G.

Then the map

h : (U −, A1, U +) → (U −, A1, hU +)

acts on this function by ν(h), i.e. f (h · x) = ν(h)f (x), and the map
h : (U −, U +, A2) → (h−1U −, U +, A2)

acts on this function by λ(w0(h−1)), i.e. f (h·x) = λ(w0(h−1))f (x). Using the formula p∗(Xi) =

(cid:3)

, we get our result.

Thus the edge coordinates on the X space give the usual “shear” coordinates. The usual

cutting and gluing arguments allow us to conclude the following:

Theorem 6.5. The spaces AG,S and XG′,S together have the structure of a cluster ensemble.

CLUSTER STRUCTURES ON HIGHER TEICHMULLER SPACES FOR CLASSICAL GROUPS

7. Applications

Let (A,X ) form a cluster ensemble, attached to the seed data Σ = (I, I0, B, d). Then the
results of [FG2], [FG3] and [FG5] give a deformation quantization Xq of the space X , as well as
representations of this quantum algebra on a Hilbert space. Moreover, on this Hilbert space,
we get a natural projective unitary action of the cluster modular group of (A,X ).
The results of this paper can be interpreted as saying that, ﬁrst of all, (AG,S,XG′,S) is a
cluster ensemble whenever G is a classical group; and second, that in these cases, the cluster
modular group of (AG,S,XG′,S) contains the mapping class group of S. Thus, we get a projective
unitary representation of the mapping class group of S coming from the higher Teichmuller
spaces AG,S and XG′,S. This is the kind of data one expects to get from a modular functor. It
remains an open question whether these projective unitary representations ﬁt together to give
a modular functor. This is was conjectured by Teschner in [T].

In this section, we sketch how to construct the space Xq and the Hilbert space it acts on.
Consider the seed Σ = (I, I0, B, d). The B-matrix encodes the Poisson structure on X . Let

There is a canonical Poisson structure that is given in the torus chart XΣ by

This at ﬁrst glance seems to depend on which torus chart XΣ we are using, but it turns out to
be invariant under mutations.
In order to quantize the space X , we ﬁrst construct a q-deformation of each XΣ, which we will
call XΣ,q. XΣ,q will be a quantum torus. It is given by generators Xi, i ∈ I and commutation
relations

(21)

q−bεij XiXj = q−bεji XjXi

Thus each seed gives a quantum torus. We now need to glue together these quantum tori,
i.e., ﬁnd rational maps between the non-commutative algebras XΣ,q that quantize the maps
between the algebras XΣ.
Recall that if Σ′ is obtained from Σ by mutation at k ∈ I \ I0, we have a birational map
µk : XΣ → XΣ′ . It is deﬁned by

Now consider the special case of the space XG′,S. Suppose that S has n boundary com-
ponents. Then the monodromy around each boundary component is an element of the Borel
subgroup B′ ⊂ G′. There is a natural projection B′ → H. Therefore, we get a map

π : XG′,S → H n.

It turns out the the functions on H n are precisely the center of the algebra of functions on
XG′,S, i.e., they Poisson-commute with everything. The ﬁbers of π are the symplectic leaves of
XG′,S.
Every choice of a point in c ∈ H n prescribes values for the center of the algebra of functions
on XG′,S,q. The remaining functions essentially form a Heisenberg algebra, and hence have a
unique unitary representation on a Hilbert space Hc. This Hilbert space gives a projective
unitary representation of the mapping class group of S.
