Abstract

We present a ﬁrst-principles CFT calculation corresponding to the spherical collapse

of a shell of matter in three dimensional quantum gravity.

In ﬁeld theory terms, we

describe the equilibration process, from early times to thermalization, of a CFT following

a sudden injection of energy at time t = 0. By formulating a continuum version of

Zamolodchikov’s monodromy method to calculate conformal blocks at large central charge

c, we give a framework to compute a general class of probe observables in the collapse

state, incorporating the full backreaction of matter ﬁelds on the dual geometry. This

is illustrated by calculating a scalar ﬁeld two-point function at time-like separation and

the time-dependent entanglement entropy of an interval, both showing thermalization at

late times. The results are in perfect agreement with previous gravity calculations in the

AdS3-Vaidya geometry. Information loss appears in the CFT as an explicit violation of

unitarity in the 1/c expansion, restored by nonperturbative corrections.

The contradiction between black holes and local quantum ﬁeld theory, manifested in the infor-

mation paradox and related puzzles, is sharpest for transient black holes that form by collapse,

slowly evaporate, and eventually disappear. In three or more spacetime dimensions, AdS/CFT

strongly suggests that information is recovered [1, 2]. In the three-dimensional case, enhanced

symmetries greatly simplify the problem of calculating quantum gravity observables, so the 3d

BTZ black hole [3] is perhaps the ideal arena to address information loss. There is every reason

to believe that the mechanism for information recovery in 3d gravity is the same as in four

dimensions (unlike the 2d case, which is exactly solvable but qualitatively diﬀerent [4]); after

all, 3d gravity coupled to matter can capture a full higher dimensional string theory [1, 2].

Black holes in AdS3 can, in principle, be treated nonperturbatively using the dual CFT.
An important ﬁrst step is to derive the leading order, semiclassical gravity predictions directly

2

from CFT. Information loss is then a question of nonperturbative corrections to this leading

term.

Many of the predictions of pure 3d gravity — meaning the gravitational sector alone, ig-

noring the contributions of matter ﬁelds — can already be derived from CFT. Early successes

include the calculation of black hole entropy [1, 5], thermodynamics [6, 7], and much more. Re-

cently, these methods have been recast and extended to a set of general techniques for computing

observables in large-c conformal ﬁeld theory, without reference to a particular Lagrangian or

other microscopic details [8–11]. (See also [12–15] for earlier work in this direction, and [16–38]

for related developments and applications.) This ‘1/c expansion’ reﬂects the perturbative ex-
pansion in (cid:96)Planck/(cid:96)AdS ∼ 1/c on the gravity side. It relies on a large central charge c and a
sparse spectrum of low-dimension operators, two ingredients universal to every theory with a

gravitational dual (as discussed for example in [39, 40]). In many cases, it also relies essen-

tially on the Virasoro algebra, which is connected to the topological nature of pure 3d gravity.

However, the diﬃcult and interesting questions in quantum gravity, including the information

paradox, require coupling gravity to dynamical matter ﬁelds so that the theory is no longer

topological. These additional degrees of freedom must ultimately be incorporated into the 1/c

expansion.

A technique for computing correlation functions of arbitrary heavy operators in the 1/c ex-

pansion was formulated in [8], using a monodromy prescription that was introduced in a classic
‘Heavy’ means the scaling dimension is ∆ (cid:29) 1, including
paper of Zamolodchikov [41, 42].
states with ∆ ∼ c that backreact on the geometry on the gravity side. The ﬁrst steps towards
coupling gravity to matter, in CFT language, were made in [11, 21, 23], where the monodromy

method was used to calculate universal long-distance correlators in high-energy eigenstates.

The calculations give thermal CFT answers, which agree with the corresponding calculations

done in eternal black hole geometries on the gravity side, so these heavy eigenstates are inter-

preted as black hole microstates. Similar methods were used to calculate geodesic lengths and

entanglement entropies in eigenstates and local quench states [30]. All of these calculations

involve a small number of local operator insertions, interpreted on the gravity side as defects

propagating on a ﬁxed geometry.

These methods have not yet been applied to collapsing black holes, the most interesting

arena for information puzzles. In fact, to our knowledge, there has never been a CFT calculation

of dynamical quantities dual to a collapsing black hole in any dimension. The aim of this paper

is to ﬁll this gap. We do so by incorporating the simplest form of smooth matter into the

1/c expansion: null dust. Null dust can be created by inserting local operators in the CFT.

By taking the limit of an inﬁnite number of dust particles, holding ﬁxed the total energy,

3

we construct CFT states dual to collapsing black holes. The limiting procedure replaces the

large number of discrete particles by a smooth matter stress tensor supported on a spherically

symmetric collapsing null shockwave. It is dual, therefore, to the Vaidya geometry in AdS3.
This geometry is ideally suited to 1/c techniques, since it allows for a study of black hole

collapse but is insensitive to the detailed dynamics of the underlying matter ﬁelds.

In this dynamical CFT state, we develop large-c methods to compute probe observables,

including n-point correlation functions and entanglement entropies. Unlike all of the previous

1/c calculations described above, the stress tensor in the collapse state is not meromorphic,

so this requires essentially new techniques. The results match precisely with numerous gravity

calculations in the literature [43–49]. We also use our CFT methods to predict new observables

in AdS3-Vaidya, such as the equal space two-point function at time-like separation in the global
geometry. The non-trivial agreement, where gravity answers are known, lends support to the

claim that this state is dual to the collapse geometry.

Interestingly, these observables ‘see’

the geometry behind both the event horizon and the apparent horizon of the collapsing black

hole [44, 45]. Such probes have been discussed in CFT before [50, 51], though not in detail for

black holes formed by gravitational collapse.

Our primary tool is the Virasoro vacuum block at large c. This fascinating object is, roughly

speaking, the sector of the CFT dual to the gravitational sector in the bulk [8]. On the one

hand, Virasoro blocks are completely ﬁxed by symmetry, but on the other hand we use the

vacuum block to extract truly dynamical quantities which are not ﬁxed by symmetry. This is

possible in theories with a large gap in the spectrum of operator dimensions, by making some

reasonable assumptions about the dominant contributions to the correlator in an operator prod-

uct expansion. In the context of our collapse state this means that we are able to study the

nonlinear dynamics of a large number of ‘constituents’. Such dynamics are clearly not deter-

mined by symmetry, although our large-c conformal block techniques form a crucial ingredient.

From a more fundamental perspective we thus derive dynamics within a universal sector of

3d quantum gravity with matter which non-trivially matches with semiclassical expectations

from Einstein gravity. It is evident from our results that the correpsonding correlators in the

theory at small c look nothing like semiclassical gravity, even though this case is constrained

by conformal symmetry in exactly the same way.

To treat a smooth matter distribution, as in shell collapse, the main technical challenge is

to generalize the notion of the Virasoro vacuum block, and the techniques for calculating it, to

an inﬁnite number of operator insertions. We show that this problem simpliﬁes dramatically in

the ﬁnal limit, and leads to an intuitive calculation of the block that in many ways resembles

the dual gravity calculation.

4

Of course, reproducing gravity from CFT does not directly address the information para-

dox. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite: our CFT calculation loses information! In

particular, the probe two-point function G(t1, t2) computed in the 1/c expansion na¨ıvely decays
exponentially at late times, in agreement with the gravity side, but in violation of unitarity.

Yet the CFT is in a pure state and the exact evolution is manifestly unitary. This ‘paradox’ is

easily traced to the approximation involved in the 1/c expansion, since at late times, operator

exchanges that were initially exponentially subleading ∼ e−S (where S is the entropy) can come

to dominate the correlator. This is similar to Maldacena’s information puzzle for eternal black

holes [52]. It would be interesting to translate Hawking’s paradox or the ﬁrewall paradox [53]

into 2d CFT along similar lines, but these require evaporating black holes at very late times,

so go beyond the present paper. Further remarks on information loss and what we may hope

to learn from posing these paradoxes in CFT are in the discussion section.

Aside from applications to black holes, our method also provides a new way to study ther-

malization in quantum ﬁeld theory. There are very few situations where thermalization can be

studied analytically, especially at strong coupling. A famous exception is the work of Calabrese

and Cardy on sudden quenches [54, 55], where the Hamiltonian H0 of a gapped system is sud-
denly tuned to criticality H0 → HCFT at time t = 0. This process is modeled by a boundary
state [54,55], which is a state in the CFT with no long-distance correlations at t = 0. Our calcu-

lation, on the other hand, corresponds to a diﬀerent type of equilibration, where we start in the

CFT vacuum, then at t = 0 inject a large amount of energy into the system. The injected matter

has only short distance correlations, but unlike a boundary state, the initial state also has the

long range correlations that were already present in the vacuum. Thermalization occurs as the

injected matter equilibrates. Our calculations produce the detailed correlators throughout this

process, from energy injection to complete thermalization. The Cardy-Calabrese calculations

were in rational CFT, where individual modes can appear thermal but true thermalization does

not occur. Our setup is a strongly coupled non-rational theory with c > 1, and such 2d CFTs

truly thermalize, much like higher dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories (see [31] for a discussion

in the context of entanglement). We give explicit formulae for various two-point functions dur-

ing the collapse, but our methods also allow for the calculation of higher-point functions. It

would be interesting, therefore, to apply them to the study of quantum chaos along the lines

of [56–58], but far from equilibrium.

CFT construction in this paper.

2 The Collapse State

2.1 Motivation from the gravity side

We will construct a collapsing shell state |V(cid:105) in CFT by inserting a large number of local
primary operators. To motivate this construction, we begin by reviewing the well known gravity

calculation. The simplest model for black hole formation is the null collapse of a shell of
pressureless dust,1 with stress tensor

T µν
matter = ρ uµuν ,

where ρ is the energy density and uµ is the velocity ﬁeld. Take the metric ansatz

ds2 = −F (r, v)dv2 + 2dvdr + r2dϕ2 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

The coordinate v parameterizes an ingoing null direction and the boundary is located at r → ∞.
In the bulk, v is an ingoing null coordinate, but at the boundary v is identiﬁed with ordinary

Lorentzian time t in the dual CFT. The energy momentum tensor of an infalling thin shell of

1Although we do not consider this possibility here, the 3d black hole can also be formed by colliding a small
number of heavy particles [59]. The resulting geometry could be studied in the 1/c expansion of the dual CFT,
but it lacks spherical symmetry, so we do not expect a simple analytic formula for the probe correlators. The
relationship between the colliding particle geometries and spherically symmetric Vaidya collapse was studied
recently in [60].

where we have deﬁned r+ = (cid:96)√8GN m. This is the solution for the case where the boundary
CFT lives on S1. One can also unwrap the ϕ coordinate to obtain the metric of Poincar´e
Vaidya, which has conformal boundary R1,1 and thus corresponds to the dual CFT on the line.
In order to construct the CFT dual, the idea is to model the null dust by a large number of

individual particles, each of which will be created by a corresponding operator insertion in the

CFT. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.1. The advantage of this approach is that existing large-c

techniques in CFT can be applied to a ﬁnite number of operator insertions; we will then take

the limit of an inﬁnite number of particles, holding the total energy ﬁxed, to derive the dual to

null dust.

On the gravity side, a standard calculation shows that pressureless dust is identical to a large

number of particles traveling on geodesics. In order to produce the thin-shell Vaidya geometry,

with matter stress tensor (2.3), the individual dust particles should start at the boundary of
AdS at time t = 0, spaced uniformly around the ϕ circle.2

2.2 Deﬁnition of the Collapse State |V(cid:105)

We will derive properties of the Vaidya geometry by considering the large-c limit of CFT ob-
servables in 1+1 dimensions, meaning that we construct a quantum state |V(cid:105) whose expectation
values reproduce those computed in the gravity background (2.2) through holography. We now
embark on this CFT calculation by ﬁrst deﬁning the state |V(cid:105).

We will deﬁne the collapse state in radial quantization, which is in Euclidean signature.

2There is a subtlety in how we interpret the order of limits that deﬁnes the Vaidya spacetime. In the gravity
context, it is most natural to consider GN as a ﬁxed, small parameter, and take a large number of dust particles
n → ∞ with GN held ﬁxed. With this order of limits, the mass of an individual dust particle mdust must be
taken to zero so that the total energy stays ﬁnite. However, we will interpret Vaidya as a diﬀerent order of
limits: ﬁrst GN → 0, then n → ∞, or in other words 1 (cid:28) n (cid:28) (cid:96)AdS
. In this limit we can treat the spherical
shell as a very large number of massive particles with mdust(cid:96)AdS (cid:29) 1, while still holding ﬁxed the total energy.
The limits commute, so either order can be interpreted as the Vaidya geometry on the gravity side, but it is the
latter point of view that will be taken in the dual CFT, as discussed in detail in section 3.3. This will allow us
to treat the dust operators as heavy insertions in the CFT.

Later, we will analytically continue to Lorentzian time since our goal is to understand real time

dynamics. The gravity discussion above motivates the following construction. Denote by z the

complex coordinate of the CFT in radial quantization, so that states of the Euclidean CFT on
S1 are deﬁned on the circle |z| = 1. For each dust particle located at z = ek, with k = 1, . . . , n,
we roughly need to insert a primary scalar operator ψ(ek, ¯ek) with conformal weight hψ (and
¯hψ = hψ) on the unit circle. Such a state, however, is not normalizable, and so we regulate it
by inserting the operators instead on the circle |z| = 1 − σ for some σ > 0, eventually taken to
be small. Distributing the n operators uniformly on the circle, a natural guess for the collapse

state is then

(2.5)

where Nn is a normalization and |0(cid:105) is the conformal vacuum. The limiting procedure that
deﬁnes this somewhat formal expression will be described in detail. We can then compute the
expectation values of arbitrary local operators Q using

(2.6)

where the expectation value on the right-hand side is taken in the vaccum. We will take the

scaling dimension of the ‘probe operators’ Qi to be hi, ¯hi (cid:28) c, so on the gravity side, these

insertions do not backreact on the geometry.

A few comments are in order. In radial quantization, the conjugate of a real operator is

deﬁned as O(z, ¯z)† = z−2¯h ¯z−2hO(¯z−1, z−1), which to leading order in σ results in an operator

inserted at the same phase angle but on the circle of radius 1 + σ. Primary states in radial

quantization are deﬁned by inserting a primary operator at the origin. However, this is not

what we want, since primaries are energy eigenstates on the cylinder, with trivial dynamics.
The state |V(cid:105) has operators inserted elsewhere, so it is clearly not primary and will have true
dynamics.

Evidently the expression (2.6) instructs us to ﬁnd an ‘inﬁnite-point’ correlation function.

This sounds daunting, but the main technical result of our paper is that a correlation function
of the type (2.6) with n → ∞ becomes easy to calculate at large central charge. Although
the derivation of the prescription is somewhat technical, the actual calculations, technique in

hand, turn out to be eﬃcient and simple — easier than the gravity calculations that we will

reproduce.

8

We will choose the total energy above the threshold where black holes form, rather than

conical defects. For an explicit comparison between CFT and gravity data, the reader should

consult section 3.5.2.

One may naturally ask why we are deﬁning the collapse state by inserting operators in

Euclidean time rather than by adding a source to the CFT. We discuss the equivalence between

these two pictures in more detail in appendix A.

3 CFT Technology

3.1 Conformal block expansion

We will compute the probe correlators deﬁned in (2.6) using the conformal block expansion,

as formulated for holographic theories in [8]. In principle, this means iteratively applying the

OPE between pairs of operators, until left with a product of 3-point coeﬃcients cijk. There
are many ways to take this OPE, but in the end, crossing symmetry requires any channel to

produce the same correlator.

For concreteness, consider the 2-point function of identical probe operators,

G2(z1, z2) = (cid:104)V|Q(z1, ¯z1)Q(z2, ¯z2)|V(cid:105) .

(3.1)

(The results readily generalize to any even number of probes.) We choose to expand in the

channel summarized by the diagram

(cid:88)

i,j,...

G2 =

(3.2)

That is, we ﬁrst contract the two probes with each other, and each dust operator ψ(ek) with
its conjugate ψ(ek)†, then contract the resulting operators as indicated. The internal indices
i, j, k, . . . run over all of the primary operators in the CFT. More explicitly, this diagram stands

for the expansion

G2(z1, z2) =

(cid:88)

i,j,...

aijk...Fijk...(z1, z2)F ijk...(¯z1, ¯z2) ,

(3.3)

Figure 3.1: Two diﬀerent OPE channels for a given four-point function. These two channels have
the same trivalent graph, but correspond to two distinct conformal block expansions. They diﬀer by
moving one insertion point around another.

where the function Fijk... is the appropriate Virasoro conformal block, and the constant is the
product of OPE coeﬃcients, aijk... = cQQicψψj ··· . The blocks encode the position dependence
of the correlator, and are entirely ﬁxed by the Virasoro algebra. Though not written explicitly,

they also depend on the choice of channel, the central charge, the internal weights hi, hj, . . . ,
the external weights hψ and hQ, and the insertion points of the dust operators, ek in (2.5).
Conformal invariance could be used to ﬁx three of the operator positions, customarily to 0, 1,∞,
but it will be more convenient to leave them as written.

Note that the diagram (3.2) does not uniquely specify the OPE channel. To specify it

uniquely, we must say not only which operators are contracted, but also the set of paths Γ

used to bring these operators together on the complex plane. For example, ﬁgure 3.1 depicts

two distinct OPE channels for a four-point function. These two possibilities correspond to two

distinct sums over conformal blocks, so we will refer to them as diﬀerent channels.

3.2 It from Id

In complete generality, it is impossible to say more. The spectrum of primaries and the OPE

coeﬃcients depend on the microscopics of the CFT, so at this point we need to specialize to a

class of CFTs that can be expected to have holographic duals. To this end, we now state the

main technical assumption of this paper:

In the OPE channel (3.2), the dominant contribution at large c comes from the identity Vi-

rasoro block, that is the unit operator 1 and all its Virasoro descendants running on the internal
lines: T, ∂T, T 2, T ∂T , etc. This continues to apply in the limit n → ∞.

10

This should be viewed as a statement about the type of CFT which admits a large-c limit

with emergent gravity. For certain correlators in a special class of CFTs, it can be derived from

ﬁrst principles [8,10], but we will not restrict to such cases, leaving open the question of exactly

what class of theories is captured by this approximation. Roughly speaking, these are theories

with large c and a suﬃciently sparse spectrum of low dimension operators. This is motivated

by the observation that in the large-c limit, the Virasoro block for heavy external operators

exponentiates as [41, 42]

F ≈ e− c

6 f ,

(3.4)

where f depends on the internal and external conformal weights and the central charge only

in the ratio h/c. The sum over conformal blocks (3.3) is then a sum of exponentials, and by

the usual saddlepoint logic, we expect this sum to be well approximated by the largest term. If

there are very few primaries of low dimension, then this is the one with the strongest singularity

as the operators come together, which is the identity block, denoted

F0 ≈ e− c

6 f0 .

(3.5)

This block encodes the contribution of the unit operator and all of its descendants. Other

light operator exchanges can give comparable contributions to the correlator, but since these
have h/c → 0, they have the same conformal block in the large-c limit, and so aﬀect only the
coeﬃcient of e− c

6 f0 which is subleading at large c.

The assumption that a given OPE channel is dominated by the identity block can only hold

within some ﬁnite range of kinematics — it cannot hold for arbitrary positions of the operators.

This would violate crossing symmetry, since the identity in a given channel does not account

for the identity in a diﬀerent channel or vice-versa. This means that as we vary the kinematics,

we expect ‘phase transitions’ where the identity operator and the heavy operators in a given

channel exchange dominance [14]. The minimal possibility consistent with crossing symmetry

is that the exact correlator is approximated by the identity contribution in whichever channel

is largest. This is exactly what was proved for the torus partition function in [10], and we will

assume the same applies to the correlators considered here.

In summary, we assume

(3.6)

The maximum is taken over channels Γ of the type (3.2). All of these channels have the same

11

trivalent graph, but as discussed above, diﬀer in the paths used to deﬁne the OPE.

This gives universal results for 2D CFTs with sparse spectrum at large central charge, which

translate to a universal sector of quantum gravity theories in AdS3 in the semiclassical limit.
This approximation will reproduce the gravity answer, but cannot be the full story from the

CFT point of view, and indeed we will argue that it must break down at late times.

3.3 A zoo of limits

Before proceeding to the calculation of the Virasoro vacuum block, we pause to clarify the
various limits involved in the deﬁnition of the collapse state |V(cid:105) and the probe correlators that
we aim to compute. A variety of limits are needed:

• c → ∞, the holographic limit;
• n → ∞ to produce a smooth matter distribution from the discrete dust particles;
• σ → 0, so that the spherical shell of matter starts exactly from the boundary at time

t = 0;

• hψ/c → 0, in order to keep the energy E ∼ hψn/σ of order c in the above limits;
• and hQ → ∞, since we intend to compare the CFT correlators to the geodesic (WKB)
approximation on the gravity side (but hQ/c → 0 so that we can ignore the backreaction
of the probe particles).

How to deﬁne the precise order of limits is guided by two considerations: applicability of the
exponentiated formula for the Virasoro conformal block, and ensuring that E/c ∼ hψn/(cσ) is
ﬁxed in the limit in order to agree with the ﬁnite mass black hole. With some foresight, the

limit we will take to compute the leading large-c dependence of the correlator G2 is

interested in E ∼ c (as in the black hole) so choose σ ∼ ε. All of the ﬁnal results of the paper,
such as the eventual matching of CFT correlators to geodesic lengths, should be understood in

the sense of equations (3.7-3.8).

3.4 Semiclassical Conformal Blocks and The Monodromy

Our task is to compute the large-c Virasoro identity block with n → ∞ dust operator insertions
and two (or more) probe insertions. For any ﬁnite n, the large-c block can be computed, at least

in principle, using a monodromy method introduced by Zamolodchikov [41, 42] (and reviewed

in [8, 61]). We ﬁrst state the general procedure to compute the vacuum block, then describe
how to implement it when the operators Q are light compared to the combined eﬀect of the
operators ψ deﬁning the state.

The monodromy method was originally stated for heavy operator exchange in a four-point

function [41, 42]. It can be extended to heavy operator exchange in higher-point functions, but

we will consider only identity exchange, where the procedure is simpler. Despite the fact that the

identity is a light operator, the method still applies with no signiﬁcant changes [8]. Perturbation

theory of the monodromy equation, used to compute probe correlators, was introduced in [11].

3.4.1 The General Procedure

For a general Euclidean correlator of heavy operators (cid:104)O1(z1)···Om(zm)(cid:105), with m ﬁnite, the
monodromy method to compute the large-c vacuum block is as follows:

1. Consider the following diﬀerential equation on the complex plane:

where

m(cid:88)

k=1

Tcl(z) =

(cid:18) 6hk/c
(z − zk)2 −

ck
z − zk

χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(z) + Tcl(z)χ(z) = 0 ,

(cid:19)

(3.9)

(3.10)

and hk is the conformal weight of operator Ok. The numbers ck are called accessory
parameters and will be ﬁxed below.

2. A channel is deﬁned by contracting the external operators in pairs, Ok(zk)Ol(zl) → 1.3
To contract two operators to the identity representation, they must have the same scaling

weight, hk = hl. These contractions are indicated in the complex plane by drawing non-
intersecting closed contours around pairs of operator insertions. We denote the set of

all such cycles deﬁning a given channel as Γ. Two examples of diﬀerent channels are

illustrated in Fig. 3.2.

3This pairing completely determines the vacuum block, but this would not be the case for a conformal
block involving the exchange of non-vacuum primaries. For general operator exchange, we would also need to
specify how these exchange operators themselves are paired, and so on. This is not necessary for the vacuum
block because after pairing the external operators, we have a correlator made entirely of stress tensors. Such
correlators are ﬁxed by the Virasoro algebra and are independent of the fusion channel. In other words, we are

13

3. The second order diﬀerential equation (3.9) has two independent solutions, say χ1 and
χ2. These solutions may undergo a monodromy as we follow them along a closed loop γ
around singular points of the diﬀerential equation,

(cid:33)

χ1
χ2

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

χ1

→ Mγ

,

(3.12)

where Mγ is a two-by-two invertible complex matrix. The accessory parameters ck are
ﬁxed (as a function of c as well as the hk and zk) by demanding that the monodromy
matrix around each cycle γ ∈ Γ is trivial,

Mγ = 12×2 .

(3.13)

4. The semi-classical conformal block in a given channel Γ is determined by integrating the

partial diﬀerential equations

∂f0(z1, . . . , zm)

∂zk

= ck ,

(3.14)

subject to the boundary condition that f0 has the correct singularity near coincident

points. The leading singularity as zk → zl is (zl − zk)−2hk, so comparing to (3.5), this

boundary condition is

f0(z1, . . . , zm) (cid:39)

12hk

c

log(zl − zk) as

zl → zk .

(3.15)

As a byproduct, this method also computes for us the expectation value of the CFT stress

tensor. In the case that the correlator is dominated by the vacuum block, the relation is simply

(cid:104)T (w)O1(z1)O2(z2)···Om(zm)(cid:105) =

Tcl(w) + O(c0)

(cid:104)O1(z1)···Om(zm)(cid:105) .

(3.16)

The necessity of the factor c/6 is apparent from the coeﬃcient of the leading singularities in

(3.10), which is hk for the usual normalization of the CFT stress tensor.

3.4.2 Heavy-Light Perturbation Theory

To compute correlators for probe operators of equal weight hQ in the collapse state |V(cid:105), the
relevant diﬀerential equation has the following Tcl:

2n(cid:88)

k=1

(cid:18) 6hψ/c
(z − xk)2 −

z − xk

(cid:18) 6hQ/c
(z − zk)2 −

k

cQ
z − zk

(cid:19)

Tcl(z) =

.

(3.17)

Here we have split up Tcl(z) into the contributions from the insertions ψ deﬁning the state, and
from the probe insertions Q. The singular points xk are taken to be x1, . . . , xn = e1, . . . , en and
xn+1, . . . , x2n = 1/¯e1, . . . , 1/¯en, while at this stage z1, . . . , zk are left arbitrary.

Suppose that the second contribution in (3.17) is parametrically smaller than the ﬁrst. Later
on, we will choose the dimension of the dust operators to scale so that the ﬁrst term is O(c0),
so we should choose the probes to have scaling dimension hQ ∼ εc with ε (cid:28) 1. In other words,
1 (cid:28) hQ (cid:28) c. In gravity-inspired language we view the ψ’s as creating a background which
is probed by the Q’s. A method to solve the monodromy problem in this limit, with a ﬁnite
number n of background insertions, was introduced in [11]. We split up the energy momentum

tensor into a heavy background contribution and a light probe contribution

Tcl = TH + ε TL ,

(3.18)

corresponding to the two terms in (3.17). We then want to solve the diﬀerential equation (3.9)

15

χ = v + εw .

Working to ﬁrst non-trivial order in ε, the diﬀerential equation yields

v(cid:48)(cid:48) + THv = 0 ,
w(cid:48)(cid:48) + THw = −TLv .

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

Let V = (v1, v2)t denote a two-vector of linearly independent solutions of (3.20). Then the
solution at O(ε) can be determined by the method of variation of parameters, and is given by

with 12 = 1. The lower limit of integration in (3.22), z0, is an arbitrary complex number — we
can choose whatever starting point is convenient, and this deﬁnes the basis of solutions. The

basis also depends on a choice of path in the complex plane, implicit in (3.22).

A very nice feature of (3.22) is that we can compute ﬁrst-order monodromies with minimal

eﬀort. Suppose we are interested in the monodromy of χ around one of the probe insertions,

zk. The zeroth order solutions V have no monodromy around this point, so only the
in (3.22) can contribute. If we start with the solution χ(z) in a neighborhood of the point z0,
and analytically continue this solution along a closed curve that encircles the singularity and

(3.24)

In regions where TH and TL are both meromorphic, so is F , and the ﬁrst integral in (3.24) gives
a residue. So in these regions, the monodromy matrix on this path is

Mzi = 1 + 2πiε ResziF .

(3.25)

This technique was applied to a meromorphic stress tensor in [11], and the residues completely

ﬁx the conformal block. As we will see, our situation is more complicated, since TH is not

16

meromorphic globally, and the calculation will in general require more than just residues.

3.5 Continuum Monodromy Method

3.5.1 The Stress Tensor at O(ε0)
In the limit n → ∞ there is an inﬁnite number of ψ insertions and only a ﬁnite number of light
operators. At O(ε0) we thus want to solve the monodromy problem for an inﬁnite number of
operators. We now describe how to tackle this limit directly, leading to a drastic simpliﬁcation
of the calculation. We start by writing the stress tensor4 in the limit n → ∞ as

ˆ

(cid:34)

TH(z, ¯z) =

d2w s(w, ¯w)

(cid:35)

6ˆhψ/c
(z − w)2 −

c[s, w, ¯w]
z − w

(3.26)

where s(w, ¯w) is a weighting function for the source insertions, and c[s; w; ¯w] is an ‘accessory

functional.’ The normalized weight is ˆhψ = nhψ, which is held ﬁxed as n → ∞. Note that
s(w, ¯w) could be traded for a space-dependent scaling dimension, ˆh(w, ¯w), so all that really
matters is the scaling weight density. The form of this stress tensor can be derived by the usual

limiting procedures from the sum (3.17) and represents the same limit described in section 3.3.

Although (3.26) looks formally like a holomorphic function of z, this is not the case; it has non-

holomorphic dependence on the source location w, ¯w and after performing the integral this will

introduce a manifest dependence on ¯z. In particular, ¯∂T (cid:54)= 0, and the non-holomorphicity is

not limited to isolated points as it would be for a meromorphic stress tensor. (This qualitatively

new feature is what prevents us from adopting the simpliﬁed approach to heavy-light blocks

developed in [21].)

For expectation values in global Vaidya (2.6) we take s to have support on the two shells of

radius 1 + σ and 1 − σ where operators are inserted. More speciﬁcally, we choose

s(w, ¯w) = δ (|w| − 1 − σ) + δ (|w| − 1 + σ) .

Splitting into the inner and outer shells,

4In the present case the continuum stress tensor can be arrived at by taking the continuum limit of Eq.

Now we need to ﬁx the accessory functions c±. Our task is to implement the continuum version
of the channel depicted in ﬁgure 3.2, where each ψ is contracted with its conjugate. In the
continuum limit, this channel has a rotational symmetry which can be used to ﬁx c±(θ) up to
overall coeﬃcients:5

(3.29)

where K is a constant that will shortly be ﬁxed. This allows us to rewrite TH in terms of a
diﬀerential operator acting on a simpler integral, namely

The remaining integral evaluates to zero for |z| < 1 − σ, to − 1
|z| < 1 + σ, and to 2σ
gives TH. Regularity at inﬁnity requires TH ∼ z−4, which sets

z2 (1 − σ) in the annulus 1 − σ <
z2 for |z| > 1 + σ. Acting with the diﬀerential operator on these expressions

.

(3.30)

Therefore we ﬁnd for the ﬁnal answer

K =

TH(z, ¯z) =

−

Kσ
z2 [(1 − σ)δ (|z| − 1 + σ) + (1 + σ)δ (|z| − 1 − σ)] .

(3.31)

(3.32)

We have thus found that the stress tensor is piecewise holomorphic. The dependence on |z|
spoils the holomorphicity of the stress tensor explicitly.

Since the accessory functions c± were completely ﬁxed by symmetries and regularity, what
we have just constructed must be the continuum limit of the channel where each ψ is contracted

with its conjugate, as in ﬁgure 3.2. This will be conﬁrmed below by explicit calculation of the

monodromies.

3.5.2 Matching parameters to the gravity side

The calculation of TH holds for any σ ∈ (0, 1). The Vaidya limit is σ (cid:28) 1, and in this limit the
heavy stress tensor (3.32) is simply a constant supported on a narrow annulus around the unit

5. In cylinder coordinates z = ew, the residues should be independent of angle Im w. Translating Tww ∼
··· + K
is the origin of
w−wi
the e−iθ in (3.29). The ﬁrst equality c+ = −c− comes from imposing regularity of the stress tensor at inﬁnity.

(3.33)

The factor of 2 comes from adding the anti-holomorphic contribution (since everything we have
done applies also to TH), the factor c
6 in the ﬁrst term comes from the relative normalization
of Tcl and (cid:104)T(cid:105) (see (3.16)), and the shift by − c
24 is the usual Casimir energy in going from the
plane to the cylinder.

On the gravity side, the total energy is the mass m of the black hole, and the central charge

takes the Brown-Henneaux value c = 3(cid:96)
2GN

. There is a relative factor of (cid:96) in the usual conventions

for CFT energy and bulk energy to account for the units: E = m(cid:96). Therefore the identiﬁcation
of parameters, in order for our state |V(cid:105) to produce a black hole of mass m, is

K = 2mGN +

1
4 ·

(3.34)

From this we conclude that K must be larger than 1/4 in order to create a black hole rather

than a conical defect.

3.5.3 The Stress Tensor at O(ε)
Let us now assume that the Q insertions are light so that we may take 6hQ/c = ε as a small
parameter. We then have an expression of the form of Eq. (3.18), where TH is given by (3.32)
and

b2
z − z2
where the bk are related to the usual accessory parameters via bk ≡ cQ

k /ε. At this stage we
have specialized to NQ = 2, i.e. a two-point function in the collapse background, though the
method naturally generalizes to any ﬁnite number of probe insertions.

3.6 Solutions of the monodromy equation

3.6.1 Solutions at order ε0

Now that we have the stress tensor, the next step is to solve the diﬀerential equations (3.20),

(3.21). The ﬁrst equation is simple. We choose the basis of solutions inside the annulus

V (z) =

(There is a branch cut in (3.36), but we will only use this basis locally so this is not a problem.)

Outside the annulus, where TH(z) = 0, we choose the basis

(cid:33)

(cid:32)

˜V (z) =

z

(3.37)

(3.40)

(3.41)

We will need to solve (3.20) along contours that cross from inside to outside the annulus, by

matching the solution of the diﬀerential equation on both sides. This matching depends on the

crossing point zc. A given solution inside the annulus must match onto some linear combination
of our basis solutions outside the annulus, so we can deﬁne a matching matrix J that relates
the solution V inside to a solution J ˜V outside. For a general value of σ, this matching will
require solving across the delta function. This can be done, but to simplify the calculation we

assume from here on that

which is the Vaidya limit on the gravity side. Then we see from (3.32) that the discontinuity

induced by the delta function is subleading, and we can deﬁne the matching matrix simply by

σ (cid:28) 1 ,

(3.39)

V (zc) = J0(zc) ˜V (zc) ,

V (cid:48)(zc) = J0(zc) ˜V (cid:48)(zc) .

This yields

Now we can use these solutions to conﬁrm that the heavy stress tensor (3.32) indeed corresponds

to the continuum limit of the channel where each ψ is contracted with its conjugate, as in ﬁgure

3.2. The diﬀerential equation (3.9) should have trivial monodromy along a path that encloses

any number of ψ’s and their conjugates. Two examples of such loops are shown in Fig. 3.3.

To compute the monodromy, we need to construct a solution to the diﬀerential equation along

such a loop. Let us start with the solution V inside the annulus. Matching to the exterior,

|z| > 1 + σ, the solution is J0(zc1) ˜V , where zc1 is the crossing point indicated in the ﬁgure.

Continuing in this way, we follow the solution all the way around the contour. When we get

back to the starting point, the solution is M V with monodromy matrix

M = J0(zc1)J0(zc2)−1J0(zc3)J0(zc4)−1 ,

(3.42)

where (see ﬁgure 3.3)

zc1 = (1 + σ)eiφ1,

zc2 = (1 + σ)eiφ2,

zc3 = (1 − σ)eiφ2,

zc4 = (1 + σ)eiφ1 .

(3.43)

Using (3.41) gives trivial monodromy M = 12×2+O(σ), as claimed. (As a side remark, including
the delta functions in the matching matrix gives exactly M = 12×2 for ﬁnite σ.)

4 Calculation of CFT Correlators

Now that we’ve set up the necessary formalism and determined TH to leading order in ε, we turn
to the explicit computation of real-time correlation functions in the state |V(cid:105). The procedure
is summarized as follows. First, with light probe operators inserted at complex (Euclidean)

points z1 and z2, we ﬁx the accessory parameters bk in TL by demanding that solutions to (3.9)
have trivial monodromy around a given path γ encircling both points. We then use (3.14)

and (3.5) to obtain an expression for the semiclassical identity conformal block, which will

depend nontrivially on γ. The dominant contribution will come from the path that maximizes
(minimizes) F0 (f0). We then analytically continue the insertion points z1,2 to Lorentzian times.
We will exhibit this method in two examples of increasing diﬃculty. The ﬁrst is the equal-

space auto-correlation function G(t1, t2) with times taken before and after a global Vaidya
quench. We ﬁnd a simple analytic formula for this correlator in a CFT living on a circle of size
R. The ﬁnite-R result has never been calculated on the gravity side, but taking R → ∞, our
CFT result precisely matches a planar Vaidya-AdS3 geodesic length, as computed numerically
in [45] and analytically in [48]. The second example is the growth of the entanglement entropy

SEE of an interval of length L following the Vaidya quench. Our calculations again match the
known gravity results [44, 46, 47, 49].

4.1 The equal-space auto-correlation function G(t1, t2)

We wish to compute G(t1, t2) for t1 < 0 < t2, where the Vaidya quench occurs at Lorentzian
time t = 0. This correlator probes the physics of thermalization. The Euclidean correlator of

interest thus has probe insertions at points z1 and z2 along the imaginary axis with z2 inside
the annulus where TH = K/z2, and z1 positioned outside the annulus, where TH vanishes. The
reason for this choice is the following: had we inserted both points below the strip |zi| < 1− σ,
the monodromy prescription would give the vacuum answer (as expected for Lorentzian times
t1 < t2 < 0). Had we instead inserted the probe operators inside the strip 1 − σ < |zi| < 1 + σ,

22

Figure 4.1: Path γ deﬁning the channel of our correlation function. The black solid lines are the
shockwave insertions at |z| = 1 ± σ. The path γ actually crosses the shockwave twice at the same
point, but the crossings are separated in the ﬁgure for clarity.

we would simply ﬁnd the thermal auto-correlation function (as expected for 0 < t1 < t2).

To ﬁnd the identity block, the ﬁrst step is to compute the monodromy along the contour in

ﬁgure 4.1. The crossing points in this diagram are actually all equal,

c1 = z−

c1 = z+

c2 = z−
c2 ,

zc ≡ z+

(4.1)

but they have been separated in the ﬁgure to illustrate how they lie on diﬀerent points along the

contour γ. We will construct the global solution of the diﬀerential equation along this contour,
X = (χ1, χ2)t, following section 3.6.2. A basis of solutions inside and outside the annulus is

(4.3)

In all of the expressions that follow, the integral is taken along a short, topologically trivial

path connecting the upper and lower limits of integration. As discussed in section 3.4.2, for a

meromorphic stress tensor Tcl the monodromy matrix would come directly from the residues of
F and ˜F around the singularities zi. Since Tcl is not meromorphic, we must include contributions
from matching the solution across the annulus. Let us see how this works.

To construct a global solution along the path γ, we start at the base point z+
c2.

In a

23

neighborhood of this point, choose the solution

X(z) = χin(z)

(z ∼ z+

c2) .

(4.4)

Now, follow the path counterclockwise around z2 to get to the ﬁrst crossing point z+
solution in a neighborhood of z+

c1. The

where we have picked up the residue of F by integrating around z2 and have neglected terms of
O(ε2) in going from the ﬁrst to the second line. We now match the solution across zc1. Deﬁne
the matrix J(zc1) such that χin(z+
c1). This matching matrix J(zc) is related to
the zeroth order matching matrix J0(zc) given in (3.41) by

c1) = J(zc1)χout(z−

J(zc) ≡ J0(zc) + εJ1(zc) + . . .

Hence

X(z−

c1) = (1 + 2πiε Resz2 F ) J(zc1)χout(z−

c1) .
Next, integrate around the point z1 up to the second crossing point z−
c2, producing

From this expression we can read oﬀ the answer for a CFT on an inﬁnite line by reintroducing
the radius of the circle R and taking the limit R → ∞. Before taking the limit, let us brieﬂy
discuss the interpretation of ρ = √4K − 1. In (3.34) we related K to the mass of the ﬁnal state

black hole in the bulk dual, meaning that ρ is the bulk dimensionless temperature ρ = 2π(cid:96)/βbulk.
Via the usual AdS/CFT dictionary, we should then identify ρ = 2πR/β in the CFT, with β
the temperature of the late time equilibrium state. We can now take the R → ∞ limit:

This matches precisely with the geodesic calculation on the gravity side in [48].6

In the analytic continuation to Lorentzian signature, we implicitly chose a prescription for

analytically continuing past branch cuts. (In the ﬁnite-n correlator, these appear whenever

the probes hit the lightcones of the dust operators.) This choice of analytic continuation is

equivalent to a choice of ordering for timelike separated operators (see [62] for a detailed review).

The prescription we chose above, i.e., the na¨ıve analytic continuation of (4.13) without inserting
any additional factors of z2 → e2πiz2, corresponds to the operators ordered as written in (2.6).
This out-of-time-order correlator has the appropriate ordering for expectation values in the
state |V(cid:105).

4.2 Entanglement Entropy

We now move on to our second example: the entanglement entropy growth of an interval of

length L in the Vaidya state. The ingredients of the calculation are very similar to those in

the last section, so we will be more brief. The result can also be interpreted as an equal-time

spatial correlation function G(x1, t; x2, t) of probe operators.

Our goal is to compute the entanglement entropy of an interval of length L in the the
state |V(cid:105). To do so, we use the usual replica trick and compute a correlation function of
twist operators Gα(z1, z2) = (cid:104)V|σα(z1)˜σα(z2)|V(cid:105) where σα and ˜σα are conformal primaries of
dimension

6The prefactor i−2∆Q does not appear in [48]. This is due to a diﬀerent choice of operator normalization. We
have normalized operators so (cid:104)O(z1)O(z2)(cid:105) = |z1−z2|−2∆ on the plane, whereas operators in [48] are normalized
so that (cid:104)O(w1)O(w2)(cid:105) ∼ |w1 − w2|−2∆ as w1 → w2 on the cylinder.

Figure 4.2: Path on the z plane which deﬁnes the Euclidean OPE channel in the calculation of
entanglement entropy. The solid lines are the boundaries of the annulus 1 − σ < |z| < 1 + σ.
We impose trivial monodromy on the path γ to calculate the block in a given channel. The
dominant contribution is obtained by maximizing over zc1, zc2.

The entanglement entropy is related to the correlation function of twist operators via

(4.20)

We need to compute the monodromy matrix M of a solution to (3.9) around the path γ shown

in ﬁgure 4.2. It is not diﬃcult to see that the monodromy matrix for this path is

M = (1 + 2πiε Resz1 F ) J(zc1)AJ−1(zc2) (1 + 2πiε Resz2F ) J(zc2)A−1J−1(zc1)

(4.21)

where A is the matrix that integrates the solution χout from zc1 to zc2. However, A can be
written as A = 1 + εδA, and it is straightforward to show that δA drops out of the expression
for M at O(ε). Therefore to leading order

M = 1 + 2πiε(cid:2)Resz1 F + J0(zc1)J−1

0 (zc2)(Resz2 F ) J0(zc2)J−1

(4.22)

0 (zc1)(cid:3) .

Until now we have treated the crossing points zc1 and zc2 as arbitrary. However, in computing
the dominant contribution to the correlator, we are instructed to maximize the ﬁnal answer

over these crossing points. One can argue by symmetry that the dominant path γ should be

symmetric about its middle, that is for zc1 = (1−σ)eiq then zc2 = (1−σ)ei(L−q) with q ∈ [0, L/2].

A similar phenomenon happens for geodesics in Vaidya—those that cross the shell of null dust

are symmetric about the middle. It is satisfying to ﬁnd a similar condition arise in CFT.

Following the procedure outlined previously, we solve for the bi that set M = 12×2 and

27

thereafter integrate them to obtain f0. We ﬁnd (labeling zi = eiθi):

U V /2

We have reintroduced the radius of the CFT circle R in the ﬁnal answer and replaced ρ with
2πR/β. This answer was calculated via a bulk geodesic length in [44, 49]. Taking the R → ∞
limit of the above answer gives the planar Vaidya geodesic length calculated in [46, 47].

This formula for the growth of entanglement after the Vaidya quench is only valid for
0 < L < πR. For L > πR one simply replaces L → 2πR − L in the above formula, implying
that the entanglement entropy of the interval of length L is equal to the entanglement entropy

of its complement, as expected in a pure state.

5 Discussion of Information Loss

The exact CFT calculation is obviously unitary, but the leading term in the 1/c expansion at

early times may not be. In fact, since it agrees with the gravity side, we expect the telltale signs

of information loss in the approximate CFT calculations. In eigenstates, this was demonstrated

for 2-point functions in [11] (see also [21, 23]), and discussed in terms of entanglement entropy

in [30]. The story for black holes forming by dynamical collapse is similar.

Correlators

Consider the late-time behavior of the correlator (4.17):

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

,

(5.1)

G(t) ∼ exp

−

2π∆Qt

β

where we have set t1 = 0, t2 = t. This permanent exponential decay is incompatible with
quantum mechanics, as pointed out in the case of the eternal black hole by Maldacena [52].

This follows on general grounds for any system with ﬁnite entropy (see for example [64]).
n an|n(cid:105), if we decompose the correlator as

Intuitively the reason is that in a pure state |Ψ(cid:105) =(cid:80)
(cid:88)

a sum over eigenstates,

G(t) ≡ (cid:104)Ψ|O(t)O(0)|Ψ(cid:105) =

n,k

ei(En−Ek)ta∗

n(cid:104)n|O|k(cid:105)(cid:104)k|O|Ψ(cid:105) ,

(5.2)

then the large phases in this sum at late times can make the correlator very small, but cannot

cancel exactly.

Returning to the ﬁrst step in the CFT calculation, it is obvious what went wrong – we kept

only a single term in the conformal block expansion (3.2). Under our assumptions about the

spectrum, this term is exponentially dominant at early times, but it cannot be the full answer,

since the vacuum block alone (or indeed any individual conformal block) violates crossing

symmetry. In general, it is not possible to compute the subleading terms, which come from

heavy operator exchange and depend on the details of the CFT. But we can easily see from

crossing symmetry that they must exist, and dominate at late times. The decomposition (5.2)

29

in the state |Ψ(cid:105) = |V(cid:105) can be viewed as an OPE channel,

(cid:88)

primaries

G =

,

(5.3)

where the ψ’s on the left half of the diagram are the ones inserted at |z| = 1 + σ, and the ψ’s
on the right are those inserted at |z| = 1 − σ. Then the same general reasoning that applies to
(5.2) also applies to this correlator, so it cannot go exponentially to zero. Crossing symmetry

then implies that the heavy operators in the original channel (3.2) produce a ﬁnite, late-time

tail that resolves the tension with unitarity. At early times, the contributions of these heavy

operators are suppressed nonperturbatively in 1/c.

Of course, this does not explain how information is recovered in the bulk — Hawking’s

paradox is a problem with bulk eﬀective ﬁeld theory, so must ultimately be solved on the gravity

side. It does, however, sharpen the problem, since in the CFT (unlike in Hawking’s calculation)

we made a controlled approximation to a well deﬁned exact calculation, and conﬁrmed that

this approximation breaks down before unitarity is violated. In gravity language, this supports

the standard expectation that information should be restored by eﬀects nonperturbative in GN.

Entanglement entropy

Entanglement entropy is also a delicate probe of unitarity. In a pure state,

SA = SAC

(5.4)

where AC is the complement of region A. Even Hawking’s original calculation of black hole

evaporation in asymptotically ﬂat spacetime can be viewed as a violation of (5.4), taking region
A to be a portion of null inﬁnity. In this case A contains the early Hawking radiation, and AC

contains the late Hawking radiation, so (5.4) holds if the total state of the radiation is pure.

In our case, region A is a segment of the CFT circle at ﬁxed time. The calculations of SA
and SAC are obviously identical, since they both correspond to the same twist correlator. On
the bulk side, this means that the answer we have derived allows the entanglement geodesic to

be taken through the black hole horizon. For an eternal black hole, this would be disallowed

by the homology condition for the extremal surface, conjectured in [43] and derived in [65].

However, for a collapsing black hole, the homology condition (in this case only a conjecture,

30

since [65] does not apply) allows us to deform the extremal surface into the past, behind the

formation of the horizon, and onto the other side of the black hole [66]. The choice of channels

in the CFT calculation directly mimics this procedure and conﬁrms this expectation directly

from CFT. The bulk geodesic that goes the ‘long way’ around the horizon corresponds to

the identity block in a subdominant OPE channel of the CFT; these two channels exchange

dominance when region A is exactly half the system size, L = πR.

A Sources vs. States

The reader may wonder whether it is more natural to perform a diﬀerent calculation: Instead

of inserting primary operators oﬀset in Euclidean time, we could instead add to the CFT a

source term deforming the action,

ˆ

S → S +

d2x J(t, x)O(t, x) ,

(A.1)

where O is a scalar operator and J(t, x) is its classical source. Performing a spatially homo-
geneous quench means that J = J(t), and, following the gravity calculation of [67], we take

J(t) to be compactly supported in time, that is we choose a smooth function J(t) such that
J(t) = j0 (cid:54)= 0 on an interval of size η centered on t = 0 and zero otherwise. After the source
turns oﬀ, the system is simply the original CFT in some excited state.

Under our assumption that correlators are dominated by stress tensor exchange, all that
matters is the value of (cid:104)T(cid:105) in this excited state – if it agrees with (cid:104)V|T|V(cid:105) computed in section

31

Figure A.1: The CFT calculation dual the null shell collapse in AdS3 gravity employs the in-in
formalism. The time evolution contour is indicated in red: The state is prepared by a Euclidean
path integral on the unit disk, with operators inserted at |z| = 1 − σ, followed by forward-backward
evolution along the Lorentzian part of the contour. The ﬁnal part of the evolution is over the outside
of the Euclidean disk, with operators inserted at |z| = 1 + σ. In practice we construct all quantities
via analytic continuation from the Euclidean block.

32

 1 †1 †2 2 k †k3, then all probe observables will agree in these two approaches. The calculation with sources

appears to be more diﬃcult, however, since a ﬁnite, exponentiated source produces UV diver-

gences that need to be regulated and resummed. We will not attempt the full calculation, but

in what follows, we describe the setup in the approach (A.1) and check that the leading term
for |j0| (cid:28) 1 — the collapse of a small mass black hole, for which resummation is not necessary
— agrees with our calculations in the state |V(cid:105).

In the presence of a source (A.1), correlation functions are computed in the interaction

picture as

(cid:104)Q1(t1)···Qp(tp)(cid:105) = (cid:104)U†(t,−∞)QI

1(t1) . . .QI

p(tp)U (t,∞)(cid:105) ,

(A.2)

where t = max(t1, . . . tp) is the largest time of any of the operator insertions and the superscript
‘I’ denotes that the corresponding operator is in the interaction picture with respect to the

decomposition (A.1). The evolution operator is

(cid:18)

ˆ

tB

HI(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)(cid:19)

U (tB, tA) = T exp

−i

tA

.

(A.3)

Such amplitudes are computed in the ‘in-in’ formalism, starting and ending in the CFT vacuum.

This follows from the perturbative expansion of (A.2). In essence the time evolution operators

in (A.2) prescribe a sum over diﬀerent time orderings of the operators, each of which can be

reconstructed using a suitable  prescription from the Euclidean correlation function. One may

similarly view the ‘state’ computation as an in-in correlator, whereby the state is produced by
Euclidean evolution for a time σ (the insertions on the circle of radius 1− σ) before switching to
Lorentzian evolution to compute the expectation value for Q(t). The overlap with the conjugate
state (cid:104)V| then corresponds to backwards time evolution, as for the ‘in-in’ prescription (see Fig.
A.1).

Let us illustrate the procedure following from the expression (A.2) by computing the expec-

tation value of the stress tensor to leading order in the perturbative expansion. We focus on

the second-order contribution

(A.4)

where the quench Hamiltonian is

ˆ

HI(t) =

dyJ(y, t)O(y, t)

(A.5)

and Q(t) is the operator whose time evolution we wish to determine. The term (A.4) will be

33

the leading contribution when zeroth and ﬁrst-order contributions vanish. If we are interested
in energy density, we should take Q = T00. Then this integral contains a U.V. divergence
∼ (2σ)2−2∆, where σ is a regulator (see [68]), and ∆ is the conformal dimension of O. It follows
that (cid:104)Q(cid:105) ∼ Θ(t)η2−2∆ + U.V., which coincides with the result for a marginal operator in the

gravity calculation of [67].

Similarly we can compute the entanglement entropy of an interval of size L with endpoints
(cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2, in which case we take Q(t) = σn(t, (cid:96)1)˜σn(t, (cid:96)2) in (A.4). Now the leading contribution
to the R´enyi entropy near n = 1 comes from the heavy-heavy-light-light four-point function
(cid:104)Oσn˜σnO(cid:105), which was computed in [30], suitably continued to reproduce the Lorentzian order-
ings in (A.4). From this one can recover the entanglement entropy in the limit n → 1. We have
calculated the resulting double integral over sources numerically and found agreement with the
0/η2∆−2
full answer (4.25) to leading order in the small-mass expansion EL (cid:28) 1, where E ∝ j2
is the energy of the ﬁnal black hole. Such energy scaling has previously been pointed out

by [69, 70].
