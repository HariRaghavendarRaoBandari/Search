Rapid advances in modern communication technology are enabling the accumulation of large-
scale, high-resolution observational data of spatiotemporal movements of humans. Classiﬁcation and
prediction of human mobility based on the analysis of such data carry great potential in applications
such as urban planning as well as being of theoretical interest. A robust theoretical framework is
therefore required to study and properly understand human motion. Here we perform the eigenmode
analysis of human motion data gathered from mobile communication records, which allows us to
explore the scaling properties and characteristics of human motion.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Thanks to rapid advances in data retrieval technol-
ogy coupled with the advent of the Internet and per-
sonal electronic devices, we are witnessing the emergence
of unprecedented opportunities to collect, analyze, and
understand massive data encoding a variety of human
behaviors, prompting calls for collaborative eﬀorts from
various disciplines in the scientiﬁc community [1]. One
topic gaining heightened interest in the physics commu-
nity in particular is how one can understanding the spa-
tiotemporal movements of humans [2], an example being
a recent numerical study by Gonz´alez et al. of human
mobility data gathered from mobile phone communica-
tion records [3]. One intriguing ﬁnding in their work was
that the distance or area covered by human trajectory ap-
pears to be bounded or increase extremely slowly in time
t, which highlights the stark diﬀerence between classi-
cal models of particle motion such as Random Walk and
L´evy Flight [4, 5] where the expected ﬂuctuation in the
displacement of a particle grow unbounded as polynomi-
als of time t (a notable exception is the Random Walk
in Random Enviroment (RWRE) where a weak spatial
randomness assigned to lattice points lead to a ∼ log2 t
behavior in the average ﬂuctuation [6–10]). Given the
success of these models in explaining real physical sys-
tems such as diﬀusive gases in free space, it is natural
to examine their validity in understanding human mobil-
ity data. But as Gonz´alez et al.
showed, the simplis-
tic nature of these models are not suited for that task,
which showcases the inherent complexity of human mo-
tion. For the same reason, devising a simple generative
model of human motion appears extremely diﬃcult if at
all possible, requiring more theoretical approaches to un-
derstanding the observed behavior of human motion on
a deeper level.

As a ﬁrst step in that direction,

in this paper we
study analytically a number of observations given in
Gonz´alez et al. Speciﬁcally, we employ the framework
of Markov processes, the fundamental and indispensable
methodology in the study of stochastic processes in a va-
riety of scientiﬁc and engineering ﬁelds such as including
linguistics, computational biology, graph theory, and in-
formation theory, to name a few[11–14]: we construct
the Markov transition matrix from mobile communica-
tion data, and investigate its properties via eigenmode
analysis. We show that this allows us to understand
the aforementioned slow increase of ﬂuctuations in hu-
man motion in time and, furthermore, and promises to
be a methodology to characterize patterns of individuals’
motions according via the eigenmodes of the transition
matrices.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we intro-
duce the Markov transition matrix constructed from the
observed transition rates between spatial coordinates. In
Sec. III, we investigate the various properties of eigen-
modes, from which we present a theoretical understand-
ing of the radius of gyration. In Sec. IV, we show that
the eigenmodes act as a concise descriptor of the char-
acteristics of individual movement patterns. Finally, we
summarize and discuss our ﬁndings and their implica-
tions in Sec. V.

II. THE HUMAN MOBILITY DATA AND THE

MARKOV CHAIN FRAMEWORK

For this study, we employed a mobile phone-usage data
set provided from a western European service provider,
used in a previous study of Gonz´alez et al. [3]. Fig. 1 (a)
illustrates the basic format of the data; for each individ-
ual we have a table listing the time and the location of
each of N calls initiated by the user (varying from indi-

vidual to individual) during an observational period of six
months. The spatial location of the user at the call initi-
ation is given by the ID of the transmission tower nearest
to the user, meaning that the resolution of the user loca-
tion is dictated by the size of non-overlapping Voronoi
cells centered around each tower, presented schemati-
cally in Fig. 1 (b). Since one Voronoi cell corresponds
to one transmission tower, we may use the two concepts
interchangeably. The number K of unique tower IDs ap-
pearing in Fig. 1 (a) satisﬁes K ≤ N , the number of
calls. From this table, we build for each individual a
K × K Markov matrix (also called the transition ma-
trix) M = {mij ≡ mi←j|1 ≤ i, j ≤ K}, where mij is the
probability that the user has been observed (made a call)
at Voronoi cell i right after being observed at cell j with
no other observation in between:
if the individual was
observed at j for a total of nj times and subsequently
at tower i with no observations in between for a total of
nij times (0 ≤ nij ≤ nj) during the observation period,
mij ≡ nij/nj [20].
The matrix M constructed in this manner exhibits the
following mathematical properties. First, each column

of M sums to unity since Pi mij = Pi nij/nj = 1.

The same cannot be said for the rows, however, since
M is asymmetric in general. Second, from the Perron-
Frobenius theorem, M always has a leading eigenvalue
λ0 ≡ 1, whose associated right eigenvector is e0 = p,

2

where p = {p1, p2, . . . , pK} represents the stationary
probability of observing the user at each tower location
(pi = ni/N ). This can be easily understood: the station-

arity condition is pi = Pj mij pj, which we can also write
as p = λMp with λ = 1. Lastly, all eigenvalues satisfy
|λi| ≤ 1, i.e. they are conﬁned within the unit circle on
the complex plane.
Our presentation of human motion as a stochastic
Markov process involves some simpliﬁcation. Firstly, we
assume that the calls were placed evenly spaced through-
out the six-month observation period. Therefore, we do
not address the impact of the the inter-call time distri-
bution [15] or the possible explicit time dependence of
the element mij of M. Secondly, our M incorporates
the history dependence of one step only: a transition de-
pends only on the current location, but not further into
the past. Without these simpliﬁcations, one could possi-
bly carry out a much more detailed and precise analysis.
We may, for instance, construct a time-dependent ma-
trix M(t) reﬂects the changes in call patterns during the
course of the day. We may also construct M to be of
a higher dimension (e.g., K × K × K) so that it incor-
porates history further into the past than one step as
we do here. But doing so would render the analysis pre-
sented in this paper unnecessarily complex. Nevertheless,
our current construction of M still yields interesting and
useful insights to understanding human mobility, which
we hope lays a foundation for future research that incor-
porate those possibilities.

III. TIME-EVOLUTION OF THE RADIUS OF

GYRATION

A quantity of central focus in Gonz´alez et al. is the

radius of gyration, deﬁned in a squared form as [16]

a dynamic variable (as a function of s, the index of the
calls in Fig. 1 (a)) that measures the size of the trajectory
at each transition, which demonstrated the stark contrast
between actual human motion and classical random walk
models. We here ask whether our stochastic process ap-
proximation is able to reproduce its slow, sub-polynomial
growth shown in Ref. [3]. In Fig. 2 we compare, the x-
axis rescaled from s to real time t, the empirical temporal
growth of rg(t)/rﬁnal
and that from simulations based on
M, averaged over all individuals with rﬁnal
g ≥ 100km. We
see that the actual curve and the simulation curve match
within ∼ 5%, validating our approximation. To highlight
the importance of incorporating history we also plotted
the corresponding curve generated from the Bernoulli
matrix B. A Bernoulli matrix is also a transition matrix
with no history dependence: its entry bij is simply equal
to pi = ni/N , simply the stationary probability to be at
i with no regard to one’s present location. B shows a

of M, one step) is essential in modeling human mobility.

markedly quicker convergence of rg to rﬁnal
, signiﬁcantly
deviating from actual data. This handily demonstrates
that temporal correlation between individual’s locations
is an essential factor in modelling human mobility.
In
the following, we study the relationship between rg(s),
Eq. (1) and the transition matrix to better understand
the origin of this behavior.

A. Radius of Gyration and the Transition Matrix

Under the Markov process M, the expected value of
the square of the radius of gyration, Eq. (1) [21], at the
s-th step can be written as

r2
g(s) =

where ~r(l) denotes the location of the user at the l−th
step (≤ s), P is a diagonal K×K matrix of Pij = {pi}δij,
and x = {x1, . . . , xK} and y = {y1, . . . , yK} are the co-
ordinates of the K unique Voronoi cells that a user has
visited. Thanks to the stationary condition that pi rep-
resents the probability of ﬁnding the individual at cell
i at any step, the vector product ~r(l) · ~r(l + s′) depends
only the step diﬀerence s′, leading to ~r(l) · ~r(l + s′) =
~r(1) · ~r(1 + s′) = xT Ms′
The transition matrix can be expressed as M =
L−T DR, where L and R are its left- and right-
eigenvector matrices normalized so that RLT = I, and

Px + yT Ms′

Py.

D is the diagonal matrix of M’s eigenvalues {λk|1 ≤ k ≤
K}. Therefore we can rewrite Eq. (2) as

(4)

Thus we have decomposed the expected value of
r2
g(s) into a sum of independent contributions from the
K eigenmodes of M. Speciﬁcally, Eq. (3) says that
each eigenmode contributes in two ways: via the s-
independent weight ρk and the s-dependent F (λk, s). We
show in Fig. 3 the behavior of F (λ, s)[22]: (a) When λ is
real (i.e. ω ≡ arg(λ) = 0 or π), the closer λ is to −1, the
faster the convergence of F (λ, s) to its maximum value
1. (Interestingly, λ0 = 1 does not contribute at all, since
F (1, s) ≡ 0. Also, the Bernoulli matrix B has λ = 0 as
its only eigenvalue except the leading λ0 = 1. Compare
the yellow curve in Fig. 2 and the curve for λ = 0.) (b)
When λ is complex (i.e. ω = arg(λ) 6= 0, π), convergence
to the maximum is also accelerated as ω approaches π for
a given value of |λ| (|λ| = 0.99 in Fig. 3 (b)).

B. Eigenmode weight ρ

Comparing Figs. 2 and 3, we ﬁnd that typical temporal
behavior of rg is most likely due to modes with eigenval-
ues that are real and positive, close to 1. Thus there are
two possible scenarios: The ﬁrst is that most eigenvalues
of M happen to be ≃ 1, resulting in a slow increase of rg
regardless of any other factors in Eq. (3) such as x and
y. The other is that, while the eigenvalues are broadly
distributed over the complex unit circle, only those that
are close to 1 carry large mode weights ρ.

To ﬁnd the more likely scenario, for each individual we
investigated the following two sets S1 and S2 of eigenval-
ues:

• Set S1 comprises eigenvalues with |λ| ≥ 0.6 and
−10◦ ≤ arg(λ) ≤ 10◦, contained within the
blue and the yellow areas inside the unit circle in
Fig. 4 (a).

• Set S2 comprises eigenvalues with |λ| ≥ 0.8 and
−5◦ ≤ arg(λ) ≤ 5◦, contained within the yellow
area in Fig. 4 (a).

FIG. 3: The increasing behavior of the real part of F(λ, s) for
various λ values. (a) When λ is real, F(λ, s) increases slower
as λ → 1, while for λ0 ≡ 1, F(1, s) ≡ 0. (b) The tendency is
similar in the case of complex λ (shown here for λ = 0.99eiω ),
showing a faster convergence to 1 as ω is tuned away from 0.

If the second scenario is correct, we should see only a
small number of eigenmodes contained within S1 and S2,
while their combined mode weights Pk∈S ρk account for
most of Pk ρk = r2
g. This is precisely what we see in
Fig. 4 (b) and (c): in Fig. 4 (b), we see that for 85% and
99% of the individuals, respectively, S1 and S2 contain
fewer than 20% of their eigenvalues. On the other hand,
Fig. 4 (c) shows that, for 81% and 74% of the individ-
uals, respectively, eigenmodes in S1 and S2 account for
80% − 120% of r2
g (note ρ need not be positive for ev-
ery eigenmode – ρ only has to sum up to r2
g, so the sum
of ρ of a subset of eigenmodes may exceed r2
g). Thus
we can conclude that only a minority of eigenvalues near
1 account for most of r2
g, causing the slowly increasing
behavior we see in Fig. 2.

Next, we further explore the implications of such be-
havior at the individual level by understanding the mean-
ing of the eigenmodes of M in detail.

IV. THE MEANING OF EIGENMODES

Let pk(s) denote the probability to ﬁnd an individual
at a Voronoi cell k at step s under the Markov process.
Then we can express p(s) = (p1(s), p2(s), . . . , pK(s)) as

p(s) = Msp(0) =

K

Xk=1

aiλs

kek,

(5)

k(λ∗

k)se∗
k

where {e} are the right eigenvectors of M.
The
coeﬃcients {ak} can be obtained from R−1p(0) =
(a1, a2, . . . , an). This means that p(s) is a sum of in-
dependent temporal evolutions of the eigenmodes them-
selves. Again, note that ak, λk, and ek can be complex
due to the asymmetric nature of M. A complex-valued
eigenmode would contribute to p(s), in conjunction with
its complex conjugate (which is also an eigenmode of M),
as
akλs

kek + a∗
∝ |ak||λk|s(cid:0). . . , |ek,n| cos(αk + ωks + φk,n),

. . .(cid:1),
(6)
where ek,n is the n-th component of ek, and αk ≡
arg(ak), ωk ≡ arg(λk), and φk,n ≡ arg(ek,n), guaran-
teeing that p(s), a probability, is always real.
In the asymptotic s → ∞ limit all modes decay to
zero except the leading mode with λ0 ≡ 1, so that
p(∞) = p = {pi}, the stationary occupation probabil-
ity. For ﬁnite s, however, the transient dynamics, gov-
erned by non-leading eigenvalues, can be important and
oﬀer interesting detail of the physical process.
In this
section, therefore, we study the non-leading eigenmodes,
and discuss how they can characterize individual human
mobility patterns. For convenience, we discuss real- and
complex-valued eigenmodes separately.

A. Real-Valued Eigenmodes

Note that Eq. (6) holds for a real-valued eigenmode
as well: the angular variables {αk, ωk, φk,n} are merely
restricted to either 0 or π. First, consider φk,n. Within
the same eigenmode k, it is possible that some φk,n are
0 while others are π (equivalently, the components can
be positive or negative). Since each component corre-
sponds to a Voronoi cell, this means that we can clus-
ter the Voronoi cells into two distinct groups, according
to the sign of their eigenvectors (only in regards to this
speciﬁc eigenmode; other eigenmodes can oﬀer diﬀerent
groupings). According to Eq. (6), this means that as s
is incremented, the occupation probabilities of Voronoi
cells in the same cluster are in phase, and out of phase
with cells in the other cluster. Additionally, if λk > 0
(ωk = 0), the occupation probabilities attenuate mono-
tonically, while if λk < 0 (ωk = π), they ﬂuctuate as they
attenuate. This behavior is visualized in Fig. 5 (a), show-
ing the occupation probabilities of the two said clusters
(blue and yellow) [23]

5

We can rephrase this in a more intuitive way: When
λk > 0 (ωk = 0), the individual is likely to be contained
within the same cluster as time progresses, with a small
probability of transitioning into the other cluster. If the
individual does cross over to the other cluster, however,
the trend persists: their motion is now likely to persist in
that group. On the other hand, when λk < 0 (ωk = π),
at every step the individual tends to transition to a cell
of the other cluster, resulting in a large probability ﬂux
exchange between the clusters (hence the ﬂuctuation).

A simple illuminating example is given in Fig. 5 (b).
In it we have three Voronoi cells represented as nodes 1,
2, and 3. The corresponding transition matrix M is

M = 


1 − 2P

P

1 − P − Q

which results in the following three eigenmodes:

Eigenmode 0 : λ0 = 1, e0 =

(1, 1, 1)

(2,−1,−1)

Eigenmode 1 : λ1 = 1 − 3P, e1 =
Eigenmode 2 : λ2 = 1 − P − 2Q, e2 =
(0, 1,−1). (8)
Asymptotically (s → ∞), an individual has an equal
probability p = e0 = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) to be found at each
cell. Eigenmodes 1 and 2 dictate the transient behavior:
According to Eq. (8), in eigenmode 1, cell 1 has a positive
eigenvector component (φ1,1 > 0) while 2 and 3 have
negative components. Thus if λ1 = 1 − 3P > 0, the
walker tends to be conﬁned at cell 1 or in the cluster
of cells 2 and 3. This is intuitively understandable; a
small P means that transition between the two clusters is
discouraged, leading to the conﬁnement, and vice versa.
Eigenmode 1 does not give us the details on the transition
between 2 and 3, however. This ﬁner detail is given by
eigenmode 2: In it, cells 2 and 3 are in separate clusters
(cell 1 is completely irrelevant with e2,1 = 0):
if λ3 =
1 − P − 2Q > 0, the walker is conﬁned to either 2 or
3 with only a small probability of transitioning to the
other, and vice versa. This is presented graphically in
Fig. 5 (b).

The discussion so far puts us in a position to explain
the behaviors of F (λ, s) we see in Fig. 3. When λ < 0, the
individual has a high propensity to transition to the other
cluster than one he is in. Thus the individual covers a
larger area in the same time, and thus the radius of gyra-
tion increases faster than in the case of λ > 0. Therefore,
concentration of mode weights ρ on modes with λ ≃ 1 is
the manifestation of the nature of relatively local move-
ments of humans – were the opposite, we should see large
ρ on modes that show a faster increase of the radius of
gyration.

We present a real-world example of the Voronoi cell
clustering in Fig. 5 (c). It shows a small rectangular por-
tion of the country containing ten Voronoi cells (left) [24].

FIG. 5: (a) The two cases of the temporal evolution of the occupation probabilities in eigenmodes with real λ. When λ > 0
(ω = 0), the occupation probability of a Voronoi cell attenuates monotonically towards the stationary state, meaning a small
transition between the diﬀerent clusters (blue and yellow). When λ < 0 (ω = π), the occupation probabilities ﬂuctuate
sinusoidally, indicating an active exchange of probability ﬂux between the two clusters (the gray envelope curve is a guide).

inside one cluster, whereas when λ1 < 0, it transitions often between the two clusters. In eigenmode 2, cells 2 and 3 constitute
two distinct clusters (cell 1 is irrelevant, with its eigenvector component 0 in e2). Thus eigenmode 2 presents a ﬁner detail of
motion between cells 2 and 3 which is absent in eigenmode 1. (c) A real-world example of Voronoi cell clustering. A portion
of a major highway is contained within ten Voronoi cells (left). According to the eigenmode 1 (λ1 > 0) of an individual who
traveled along these cells, the entire portion of the highway belongs to a single cluster. However, this does net tell us whether
they were traversed in a linear fashion or in a haphazard way (however unlikely). According to the eigenmode 2, however,
the highway is divided into two adjacent compact clusters. In accordance with (b), λ2 > 0 tells us that there were minimal
transitions between the clusters, indicating that the cells were traversed in a linear fashion, which agrees with our intuition.

A segment of the nation’s highway runs along the set.
We consider two largest eigenmodes, 1 and 2, of an in-
dividual who has traversed the cells. λ1 and λ2 satisfy
1 > λ1 > λ2. Similar to the simple example of Fig. 5 (b),
according to eigenmode 1 the entire strand forms a sin-
gle cluster (center). This agrees well with our intuition
regarding a traveler on a highway – once they enter a
highway, it is likely that they stay on it, visiting each
cell (along the strand) in succession. Yet, this is not
yet a conclusive proof of it; we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility, however unintuitive it may sound, that the user
had driven in a haphazard manner among the cells. The
cell clustering according to eigenmode 2 (right) provides
an answer: λ2 > 0 means that there could have been
only minimal transitions between the two clusters, show-
ing that the traveler did move in a linear fashion on the
highway.

B. Complex-valued Eigenmodes

We can readily extend the interpretation of real eigen-
modes of the previous section into that of complex-valued
eigenmodes; we need to consider that now the angular
variables {αk, ωk, φk,n} in Eq. (6) can be of any value in
[0, 2π). This means that the Voronoi cells can be grouped
into more than two clusters, and that the occupation
probabilities of each cell may oscillate with varying peri-
ods. We again illustrate this point with a simple example
shown in Fig. 6 (a), which exhibits a natural 120◦ rota-
tional symmetry. Solving for its transition matrix, we
obtain the following eigenmodes (without loss of gener-
ality, we assume P > Q):

Eigenmode 0 : λ0 = 1, e0 =

(1, 1, 1)

1
3

Eigenmode 1 : λ1 =

1

2(cid:0)(2 − 3(P + Q) + i√3(P − Q)(cid:1),

e1 = (e−i2π/3, ei2π/3, 1)

Eigenmode 2 : λ2 = λ∗

1, e2 = e∗

1

(9)

The asymptotic occupation probability is again p =
e0 = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). More interestingly, we observe that
the eigenvector e1 and its conjugate e2 cluster the cells
into three distinct groups, regardless of P and Q. The
transient dynamics of the traveler determined by ω1 and
ω2, however, does not always reﬂect the underlying 120◦
symmetry (i.e., a rotational movement of period three).
To see why, let us rewrite |λ1| and ω1 = arg(λ1):

1

2p(2 − 3δ)2 + 3η2
|λ1| =
ω1 = arctan(cid:18) √3η
2 − 3δ(cid:19),

(10)

where we have deﬁned δ ≡ (P + Q) and η ≡ (P − Q). We
can say that δ represents the dynamism of the traveler
since it is the probability to transition to a diﬀerent cell
at each step, while η represents the rotational tendency
of the traveler since a large η would result in a stronger
clockwise tendency of movement. First, assume P = 1
and Q = 0 so that δ = η = 1. This leads to |λ1| =
1 and ω1 = 2π/3, and resulting from it is a perpetual
(non-attenuating) clockwise rotational motion of period
three, perfectly reﬂecting the symmetry of the diagram.
Any other combination of P and Q leads to a slower,
attenuating motion with larger periods, if at all – from
the construction of Fig. 6 (a), a non-zero Q or 1 − P − Q
would lead to what would function as “friction” against
a pure rotation of period three.

Yet, given that a period-three rotation is the simplest
periodic motion arising from complex-valued eigenmodes,
it appears worth investigating whether such motion can
be readily found in real human trajectories. To check
the possibility, we studied the distribution of ω = arg(λ)
for eigenvalues with magnitude |λ| ≥ 0.5 (for reasonable
persistence), shown in Fig. 6 (b). We ﬁnd that, although
the majority of eigenvalues are real (ω = 0 or π), there
exist prominent peaks at ω ≃ 2π/3(= 120◦).
In fact,
the peaks represent a sizable portion of the population
(in our dataset, 24.7% of the individuals) [25]. Although
our current data set does not include detail on the ex-
act places of visit or activities undertaken by each in-
dividual, we present one scenario that appears to be a
reasonable origin of the behavior in Fig. 6 (c): It is a
schematic of the trajectory of one of the authors (J.P.)
during typical weekdays, composed mainly of a Home-
to-Work-to-Errands-then-back-to-Home trajectory with
only occasional escapes from it. It would be extremely
interesting, when data much more detailed than the one
analyzed here becomes available, to extract such non-
trivial yet pronounced (dominant) eigenmodes of indi-

7

viduals and see whether they match well to the perceived
units of motion (e.g., commuting made up of a series of
transitions between locales).

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have presented in detail how the
framework of stochastic processes, widely used in theoret-
ical physics, can be used for analysis of large-scale human
motion data. Speciﬁcally, utilizing the well-established
theory of Markov matrices, we have demonstrated that
the observed temporal evolution of the radius of gyra-
tion can be understood via eigenmode analysis of indi-
vidual transition matrices. We have also discussed how
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related to the mi-
croscopic characteristic modes of individual mobility.

We anticipate our approach to grow more relevant as
innovations continue in large-scale data acquisition tech-
nology: even now, with GPS-enabled mobile phones be-
coming more available, individuals are able to track their
own movements over locales of interest and couple them
with digitalized geographical information (the so-called
“geo-tagging”) to construct a detailed space-time history
of one’s past whereabouts. On a more social scale, fur-
thermore, we can readily imagine the beneﬁts of a bet-
ter understanding of human mobility patterns: it would
allows us to better design infrastructure such as roads,
transportation systems, and vital utilities so that social
cost is minimized while location-based human activities
are optimally supported [17]. Also notable is the active
research eﬀort in the ﬁeld of ecology to understand an-
imal movements [18, 19] which have a potential to be
helpful in understanding human mobility in urban envi-
roments as well.

We hope that our work plays a role in highlighting
the opportunities for theoretical physicists to make novel
and innovative contributions to social and technological
problems.

 ERRANDS  

FIG. 6: (a) A simple asymmetric Markov process with a natural 120◦ rotational symmetry. According to eigenmodes 1 and 2
(complex conjugates of each other) in Eq. (9), each cell constitutes a distinct cluster, resulting in three separate clusters (blue,
yellow, and green in the ﬁgure). The dynamic property of the motion depends on P and Q. When (P, Q) = (1, 0), a permanent
(non-attenuating) clockwise rotation of period 3 occurs. In more general cases of (P, Q) 6= (1, 0), a combination of stationary
(1 − P − Q) and dynamic (P + Q) tendencies lead to an attenuating rotation of varying prolonged periods. (b) The distribution
of ω for eigenmodes with |λ| > 0.5. In addition to real eigenvalues (ω ∈ {0, 180◦}), we ﬁnd prominent peaks at ω ≃ 2π/3(120◦),
indicating that a rotational motion of (nearly) period three is commonplace. (c) An example trajectory giving ω ≃ 2π/3 as a
prominent eigenmode of motion.

[20] In order to avoid the last cell visited at tmax becoming a
“sink” which happens when there is no record of transi-
tion away from it, we assume that the individual makes
an additional transition from it to the ﬁrst Voronoi cell
visited at t1

[21] We study the squared form r2

g rather than rg which is

much more complicated to treat analytically.

[22] In Fig. 3 we show only the real portion of F:

in truth,
Im[F] 6= 0 when Im[λ] 6= 0, i.e. complex. In that case,
its conjugate λ∗ is also an eigenvalue of M with mode
weight ρ∗. The combined eﬀect of the two are basically
ρF(λ, s) + ρ∗F(λ∗, s) = 2Re[ρF(λ, s)].

[23] αk, dependent only on the initial condition, merely dic-
tates the relative magnitude of each eigenmode in Eq (6)
at s = 0.

[25] Although it would not be an isolated movement like the
one shown in Fig. 6 (a), it means that it is suﬃciently
isolated to exhibit such eigenvalues.
