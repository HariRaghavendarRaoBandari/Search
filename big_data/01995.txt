Introduction and the result

Four-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories which may be realized as a low-energy limit of
a non-abelian gauge theory with N ﬂavor massless fermions [1] are phenomenologically of
great interest because they can be a starting point to ﬁnd viable models of the walking
technicolor [2–7]. Recognition that a non-perturbative study of such conformal theories is
feasible with currently-available lattice techniques [8] had triggered many recent investiga-
tions; see a recent review [9] and references cited therein. Here, one is particularly interested
in the mass anomalous dimension of the fermion, γm, that must be of the order one in viable
technicolor models.

It is always challenging, however, to determine something quantitative for a conformal ﬁeld
theory by lattice numerical simulations. This is natural because the conformal ﬁeld theory
has no speciﬁc length scale and consequently one has to ideally work with an inﬁnite volume.1
In fact, for example, although there seems to be a consensus that the SU (3) gauge theory
with 12 fundamental massless fermions (the 12 ﬂavor QCD) has an infrared ﬁxed point,
there still exist large discrepancies among central values of the mass anomalous dimension
at the ﬁxed point, γ∗
m, depending on computational strategies; see Fig. 11 of Ref. [12] and
Table 4 of Ref. [9].

Originally motivated by the above large discrepancies in γ∗

m, in this paper, we apply
the numerical conformal bootstrap—a powerful rigorous approach to higher-dimensional
conformal ﬁeld theories—to four-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories with an SU (N ) global
symmetry. Refs. [13–35] is a partial list of references in the numerical conformal bootstrap.
See also a most recent paper, Ref. [36], and a recent review [37] for a more complete list.
Our formulation is valid for arbitrary N , but we will report our numerical results only
for N = 12 in the main text (we present the results for N = 8 and N = 16 in Appendix A).
As explained below, by combining a result from our numerical conformal bootstrap and the
fact that lattice simulations of the 12 ﬂavor QCD [12, 38–46] are consistent with the existence
of an infrared ﬁxed point, we obtain an upper bound on the mass anomalous dimension,

γ∗
m ≤ 1.29,

for N = 12.

(1.1)

Practically, this upper bound is not so strong, not being able to constrain values obtained
by existing lattice simulations.2 Nevertheless, this result appears very interesting, because
this is a strict bound (within the numerical accuracy) which follows solely from very gen-
eral properties of a unitary conformal ﬁeld theory. There even exists a possibility that this
bound becomes stronger, when the level of approximations which we made in our numerical
conformal bootstrap is increased.

Now, in the context of the technicolor model, one is interested in the anomalous dimension

of the ﬂavor-singlet scalar density,

S =

N

Xk=1

¯kψk,
¯ψ

(1.2)

1 An intriguing possibility to evade this is to employ the conformal mapping from R4 to R × S3

and a lattice discretization of the latter space [10]. See also Ref. [11] for an alternative approach.

2 There exists a rigorous bound that follows from the unitarity [47], γ ∗

m ≤ 2.

where k (¯k) denotes the index of the fundamental (anti-fundamental) representation
of SU (N )—the ﬂavor group—in a QCD-like theory. This is because the expectation value
of S provides the technifermion condensate. Since the combination m0S is not renormalized,
m0S = mSR, where m0 is the bare mass parameter and the right-hand side is the product of
the renormalized quantities, the anomalous dimension of S is given by the mass anomalous
dimension γm, deﬁned by

γm = −(cid:18)µ

∂

∂µ(cid:19)0

ln Zm,

m = Zmm0,

(1.3)

where the subscript 0 stands for bare quantities are kept ﬁxed. We are interested in the value
of γm at the infrared ﬁxed point, γ∗
m.

In the above QCD-like theory, we assume that the SU (N ) ﬂavor group is chiral in the
sense that we actually have the chiral symmetry SU (N )L × SU (N )R. Then, applying the
ﬂavored chiral rotation to the scalar density (1.2), we have a pseudo-scalar density,

(1.4)

which belongs to the adjoint representation of SU (N ). Since the ﬂavor rotation and the
scale transformation commute, the pseudo-scalar adjoint operator φ¯k
i possesses the same
m and the scaling
scaling dimension ∆φ¯k
dimension ∆φ¯k

as S (1.2). Then, the mass anomalous dimension γ∗

i

(at the ﬁxed point) are related by

i

γ∗
m = 3 − ∆φ¯k

i

.

(1.5)

This also directly follows from the PCAC relation.

In Sec. 2, we consider a four-point function of a spin 0 adjoint operator φ¯k

i without
specifying its actual microscopic structure such as Eq. (1.4).3 We derive the crossing rela-
tion associated with the four-point function, basically following the notational conventions
of Ref. [18]. Then, in Sec. 3, we apply the numerical conformal bootstrap to the crossing
relation. For this, we used a semideﬁnite programming code, the SDPB of Ref. [34].

In this way, among other things, we found that for N = 12 the system contains a spin 0

relevant operator in the representation [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] of SU (N ),4 when

∆φ¯k

i

< 1.71,

for N = 12.

(1.6)

Since this relevant operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation appears in the opera-
tor product expansion (OPE) of two φ¯k
i s, if the latter is identiﬁed with the pseudo-scalar
density in Eq. (1.4), this is a scalar density. Such an SU (12) non-invariant operator is not
radiatively induced, even if it is relevant, if our regularization preserves the SU (12) sym-
metry. We note however that in all existing lattice simulations of the 12 ﬂavor QCD, the

3 We do not assume the underlying gauge theory neither; we assume only that the theory is

conformal and possesses a global SU (N ) symmetry.

4 We label representations of SU (N ) by a list of the (non-increasing) number of boxes in each
column of the corresponding Young tableau. For example, the adjoint representation is denoted
as [N − 1, 1]. For N = 12, we should say [11, 11, 1, 1] rather than [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1], but in this paper
we use the latter notation even for N = 12. This remark is applied also for other representations and
for other values of N .

staggered fermion [48] is employed to prevent the fermion mass operator (which is believed
to be a unique spin 0 SU (12) invariant relevant operator associated with the infrared ﬁxed
point under consideration) from being radiatively induced. This is accomplished by the exact
U (1)A symmetry [49] that the massless staggered fermion possesses. Still, however, the stag-
gered fermion cannot preserve the full SU (12) ﬂavor symmetry (the so-called taste breaking).
Generally, when the regularization does not preserve a symmetry, relevant operators which
are not invariant under the symmetry are radiatively induced and, to achieve the desired
continuum or low-energy limit, one has to tune coeﬃcients of those non-invariant operators
in the action. The fact that actual lattice simulations [12, 38–46] of the 12 ﬂavor QCD is
consistent with the existence of an infrared ﬁxed point without such a ﬁne-tuning strongly
indicates that the theory does not contain the above SU (12) non-invariant relevant operator
in the spectrum.

Thus, assuming the absence of the spin 0 relevant operator in the representation [N −
≥ 1.71. Then the upper bound on the mass

1, N − 1, 1, 1], we have an inequality ∆φ¯k
anomalous dimension (1.1) follows from the relation (1.5).

i

To really draw the above conclusion, we still have to show that the SU (12) non-invariant
operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation is not prohibited by exact symmetries
of the staggered fermion [50, 51]. This group-theoretical question can be studied with the
help of Ref. [52] that provides a complete list of SU (12) non-invariant5 operators up to
the canonical mass dimension 6 which are consistent with (i.e., not prohibited by) exact
symmetries of the staggered fermion. The authors of Ref. [52] show that, for example, the
following four-fermi scalar operator is consistent with exact symmetries of the staggered
fermion:

(1.7)

where γµ is the conventional Dirac matrix and ξ5 is a ﬂavor-space counterpart of the γ5
matrix. To examine whether this combination contains the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representa-
tion under the decomposition into irreducible representations of SU (12), we take a possible
explicit form of an operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation,

(1.9)

in the system of free fermions. If this two-point function is non-zero, then the oper-
ator X contains the component of the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation. Assuming a
particular representation of ξ5 in which the component (ξ5)¯1
1 is non-zero, it is easy to see
that hXO(¯1¯1)
(11)i ∝ −32(1 − 2/N + 4/N 2). This shows the above assertion: Exact symmetries
of the staggered fermion cannot exclude the relevant operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1]
representation of SU (12) from being radiatively induced.

5 This reference studies the SU (4) case but we can simply make the results to triple for SU (12).

In the conformal ﬁeld theory, four-point functions such as Eq. (2.1) can be computed by
applying the OPE to pairs of operators. The OPE between two operators in the adjoint
representation of SU (N ) is decomposed into the sum over operators in various irreducible
representations of SU (N ) (the Clebsch–Gordon decomposition) as

In this expression, (
] stand for the symmetrization and the anti-symmetrization of
indices enclosed and all operators are traceless with respect to any pair of upper and lower
indices. We label irreducible representations of SU (N ) by a list of the number of boxes in
each column of the corresponding Young tableau. The bar stands for the representation is
conjugated and the 1 in the last term stands for the singlet representation. The dimensions
of each representation are, N 2(N − 1)(N + 3)/4, (N 2 − 1)(N 2 − 4)/4, (N 2 − 1)(N 2 − 4)/4,
N 2(N + 1)(N − 3)/4, N 2 − 1, N 2 − 1, and 1, respectively, and thus totally (N 2 − 1)2, the
dimension of the product representation in the left-hand side. ± sign attached to each rep-
resentation denotes the parity of the spin of the operators under the sum. For example, a
spin 1 operator in the adjoint representation (there must exist at least one such operator
corresponding to the Noether current of SU (N )) is included in the third line of the above
expression ([N − 1, 1]−).

First we apply the OPE (2.3) to Eq. (2.1) in the way,

Equation (2.25) is our crossing relation. This relation restricts possible combinations of
the scaling dimension ∆, the spin ℓ, and the OPE coeﬃcient λO of a primary operator O
appearing in the intermediate state in the four-point function of φ¯k

dimension is d = ∆φ¯k

3. Numerical conformal bootstrap

i possesses the smallest scaling dimension d = ∆φ¯k

We now apply the numerical conformal bootstrap to the crossing relation (2.25). We assume
that the spin 0 adjoint operator φ¯k
among
all spin 0 operators appearing in Eq. (2.25), except the identity operator for which ∆ = 0.
First, we investigate a possible bound on the smallest scaling dimension of a spin 0 operator
in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation. For this, for a ﬁxed d, we appropriately take a
number ∆trial ≥ d. Then we seek a linear diﬀerential operator Λ, which acts on a 6-component
vector V as

i

Λ(V ) =

(3.1)

where coeﬃcients λi

m,n are real, and fulﬁlls the following conditions:

◦ As a condition for the identity operator for which ∆ = ℓ = 0, Λ(V 1+

d,0,0) = 1.

9

◦ As a condition for the spin 0 operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation,

Λ(V [N −1,N −1,1,1]+

d,∆,0

) ≥ 0 for any ∆ ≥ ∆trial.

◦ For higher spin ℓ > 0 operators in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation, Λ(V [N −1,N −1,1,1]+

d,∆,ℓ

) ≥

0 for any ∆ ≥ ∆unitary.

◦ For other representations R, for spin 0 operators, Λ(V R+
◦ For other representations R, for higher spin ℓ > 0 operators, Λ(V R±

d,∆,0) ≥ 0 for any ∆ ≥ d.

d,∆,ℓ) ≥ 0 for any ∆ ≥

∆unitary.

If we can ﬁnd a Λ which fulﬁlls the above conditions, acting Λ on the crossing rela-
tion (2.25) yields a contradiction, a strictly positive number = 0. Thus, we can conclude
that, if the system is a unitary conformal ﬁeld theory, there must exist a spin 0 operator
in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation which possesses the scaling dimension smaller than
the assumed ∆trial. Changing ∆trial, we can ﬁnd restriction on the scaling dimension of the
spin 0 operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation.

The parameter Nmax in Eq. (3.1) parametrizes the search space of Λ. When Nmax is
increased, the possible form of Λ has more varieties and it becomes easier to ﬁnd the Λ which
fulﬁlls the above conditions. As the consequence, the restriction on the scaling dimension on
the operator becomes stronger when Nmax is increased. In our present problem, the upper
bound on the mass anomalous dimension becomes lower when Nmax is increased.

The above search of Λ can eﬀectively be carried out by using the semideﬁnite program-
ming, as emphasized in Ref. [18]. For this, we used a semideﬁnite programming code, the
SDPB of Ref. [34]. There are two parameters characterizing the level of approximation in this
approach. One is the maximal spin in the above search of Λ, Lmax. Another is the order of the
rational approximation of the conformal block, keptPoleOrder. Our most strict bound below
was obtained by setting parameters as (derivativeOrder = Nmax, keptPoleOrder, Lmax) =
(16, 20, 24). We conﬁrmed that the boundary curves in Figs. 1 and 2 do not change, even
if we change the parameters (derivativeOrder, keptPoleOrder, Lmax) to, for example,
(10, 11, 22) for the Nmax = 10 case and to (16, 18, 22) (this is only for Fig. 1) and (16, 18, 24)
for the Nmax = 16 case.6

i , d = ∆φ¯k

Figure 1 is our result obtained by the above procedure. The horizontal axis is the scaling
dimension of the spin 0 adjoint operator φ¯k
. The shaded region is the smallest
scaling dimension of a spin 0 operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation of SU (N )
with N = 12 in a unitary conformal ﬁeld theory. We stress again that to have a unitary
conformal ﬁeld theory, there must exist at least one spin 0 operator in the [N − 1, N −
< 1.71,
1, 1, 1] representation in the shaded region. In particular, we see that, when d = ∆φ¯k
there exists a spin 0 relevant (i.e., its scaling dimension is smaller than 4) operator in the
[N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation. This leads to our upper bound on the mass anomalous
dimension, Eq. (1.1), as explained in Sec. 1.

A similar analysis can be repeated by paying attention to the representation [N − 2, 2]
in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.25). Figure 2 is restriction on the smallest scaling dimension of a spin 0
operator in the [N − 2, 2] representation of SU (N ) with N = 12. This is obtained by the

6 For each d, we carry out a binary search to ﬁnd the restriction on the scaling dimension of the
spin 0 operator in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation. We terminate the search when the diﬀerence
between two consecutive ∆trial became less than or equal to 0.01. Thus, we can see the change of the
boundary curve only when the change in the higher is greater than 0.01.

representation, when d = ∆φ¯k
an upper bound on the mass anomalous dimension, γ∗
m ≤ 1.59. This is however weaker than
the one following from the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation, Eq. (1.1).

Although our analysis on the representation [N − 2, 2] does not provide a useful upper
bound on γ∗
m, quite interestingly, we see that a kink-like behavior in the boundary curves
∼ 1.5. Recalling the fact that in the numerical conformal bootstrap
in Fig. 2 around d = ∆φ¯k
quite often one ﬁnds a known conformal ﬁeld theory at a kink point on the boundary curve,
the behavior in Fig. 2 is quite suggestive. It is interesting to study this kink-like behavior in
more detail and seek a possible conformal ﬁeld theory with a global SU (12) symmetry that
corresponds to the (possible) kink in Fig. 2.

Among other representations in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.25), [N − 2, 1, 1] and its conjugate possess
only odd spin operators and, spin 0 operators which can correspond to a term in the action
are not included. Representations [N − 1, 1] and 1 are somewhat special because, depending
on the underlying ﬁeld theory (e.g., the 12 ﬂavor QCD), by using the ﬂavored chiral rotation,
it is possible to construct spin 0 operators in these representations whose scaling dimension

is degenerate with d = ∆φ¯k
consider the second operator in these representations that has the scaling dimension higher
than or equal to d. Although we carried out such an analysis for the representations [N − 1, 1]
and 1, we do not present those results here, because the conclusion on the mass anomalous
dimension seems quite depend on the detail of the underlying theory.

A. Upper bound on γ ∗

m for N = 8 and N = 16

Our crossing relation (2.25) holds for any N ≥ 3 and, in this appendix, we present our
numerical results for N = 8 and N = 16. These cases are also of great interest from the
perspective of the many-ﬂavor QCD; it is conceivable that the SU (3) gauge theory with
16 fundamental massless fermions is a conformal ﬁeld theory in the low-energy limit, while
whether the 8 ﬂavor QCD is conformal or not seems not yet quite conclusive; both systems
can be simulated by using the staggered fermion.

Figure A1 is our result on the smallest scaling dimension of a spin 0 operator
in the [N − 1, N − 1, 1, 1] representation of SU (N ) with N = 8, N = 12, and N = 16
(from left to right). Boundary curves are obtained by setting, (derivativeOrder =
Nmax, keptPoleOrder, Lmax) = (14, 16, 24). As for N = 12 in the main text, we see that
when d < 1.67 for N = 8, and when d < 1.71 for N = 16, there emerges an SU (N )-breaking
relevant operator in the system. Thus, by assuming the absence of such an operator, we have
an upper bound on the mass anomalous dimension as

Although the latter bound is numerically the same as Eq. (1.1) that is for N = 12, there is
no contradiction because here we are using a somewhat narrower search space of the linear
operator Λ (Nmax = 14) than that in the main text (Nmax = 16); the bound on γ∗
m here is
thus somewhat weaker than that would be obtained from the setting in the main text.

As for the N = 12 case in the main text, although the consideration of the operator in the
[N − 2, 2] representation does not provide a useful bound on γ∗
m, we observe a kink-like
behavior also for N = 8 and N = 16. Again it is interesting to study this kink-like behavior
in more detail and seek a possible conformal ﬁeld theory that corresponds to these (possible)
kinks.
