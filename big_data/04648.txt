Extensive computer simulations are performed for a few model glass-forming liquids in both two
and three dimensions to study their dynamics when a randomly chosen fraction of particles are
frozen in their equilibrium positions. For all the studied systems, we ﬁnd that the temperature-
dependence of the α relaxation time extracted from an overlap function related to the self part of the
density autocorrelation function can be explained within the framework of the Random First Order
Transition (RFOT) theory of the glass transition. We propose a scaling description to rationalize
the simulation results and show that our data for the α relaxation time for all temperatures and pin
concentrations are consistent with this description. We ﬁnd that the fragility parameter obtained
from ﬁts of the temperature dependence of the α relaxation time to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
(VFT) form decreases by almost an order of magnitude as the pin concentration is increased from
zero. Our scaling description relates the fragility parameter to the static length scale of RFOT
and thus provides a physical understanding of fragility within the framework of the RFOT theory.
Implications of these ﬁndings for the values of the exponents appearing in the RFOT theory are
discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid rise of the viscosity of glass forming liquids
with decreasing temperature remains one of the impor-
tant unsolved problems in condensed matter physics [1–
8]. In the Random First Order Transition (RFOT) the-
ory [9–11], the growth of the viscosity is attributed to an
ideal glass transition at which the conﬁgurational entropy
associated with the multiplicity of amorphous minima of
the free energy goes to zero. This transition is supposed
to take place at the Kauzmann temperature TK at which
the excess entropy of a supercooled liquid extrapolates to
zero. This temperature is found to be close to TV F T , the
temperature at which a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)
ﬁt to temperature dependence of the viscosity of a fragile
glass-forming liquid predicts a divergence of the viscos-
ity. Equilibrium and dynamical properties of liquids near
TV F T ≃ TK can not be studied in experiments or com-
puter simulations because liquids fall out of equilibrium
at substantially higher temperatures. For this reason, the
occurrence of the ideal glass transition of RFOT theory
remains controversial.

The kinetic fragility[12], which measures the rate at
which the viscosity increases with decreasing tempera-
ture, is another interesting but poorly understood aspect
of the dynamics near the glass transition. The micro-
scopic origin of fragility has been investigated in many

numerical studies [13–17].
In these studies, attempts
were made to tune the fragility by changing diﬀerent pa-
rameters of the system, e.g. the degree of polydispersity
in particle size [13], softness of the pair potential [16], the
density of a system of particles interacting via a Hertzian
potential [15], the composition of binary glass-forming
liquids [14], and the height of a narrow repulsive spike in
the pair potential [17]. In some of these cases [13, 16],
the fragility was found to depend weakly on the tuning
parameters, so that no clear conclusion about the origin
of fragility could be reached. On the other hand, in Refs.
[14, 15, 17], the fragility was found to change by substan-
tial amounts and correlations of the fragility with other
thermodynamic quantities were obtained. However, a
clear understanding of the microscopic origin of fragility
remains elusive.

Recently, it has been proposed [18] that the ideal glass
transition of RFOT may be accessible in experiments
and simulations of systems in which a randomly cho-
sen fraction of the constituent particles are pinned at
their positions in an equilibrium conﬁguration of the liq-
uid. It is argued [18] that the temperature TK at which
the conﬁgurational entropy goes to zero in such a sys-
tem increases as the concentration of pinned particles is
increased, thereby making it possible to equilibrate the
liquid near the higher transition temperature. Results
of numerical studies [19, 20, 22] of equilibrium proper-
ties of such randomly pinned systems are consistent with
the predictions of Ref. [18]. On the other hand, a nu-
merical study [23] of the dynamics of two model liquids
with random pinning indicates that the VFT tempera-
ture TV F T obtained from the temperature-dependence
of the α relaxation time extracted from the self part of
the intermediate scattering function or a related overlap

function remains constant or decreases slightly with in-
creasing pin concentration. It is also shown in Ref. [23]
that the α relaxation time deﬁned there remains ﬁnite at
temperatures close to the values at which the equilibrium
calculation of Ref. [22] predicts a vanishing of the conﬁgu-
rational entropy. These results raise important questions
about the validity of the relation between the conﬁgu-
rational entropy and the α relaxation time predicted in
RFOT theory. Possible explanations of this discrepancy
have been suggested [23, 24], but a clear resolution is not
yet available.

In Ref. [23], it was also shown that the fragility can be
tuned very eﬀectively by changing the fraction of pinned
particles. Pinning decreases the kinetic fragility and by
increasing the concentration of pinned particles, one can
change the fragility by a large factor (≃ 10), compara-
ble to experimentally observed variations of the fragility
in diﬀerent glass forming liquids. Thus, random pinning
provides a nice way of tuning the fragility without chang-
ing the microscopic details of the system. Recently, ran-
dom pinning of the kind considered here has been realized
experimentally [25] in two-dimensional colloidal systems.
This suggests that it will not be diﬃcult to tune the
fragility in experimental colloidal glasses in the near fu-
ture. It is, therefore, important to understand the reason
for the variation of the fragility seen [23] in the dynamics
of randomly pinned liquids.

To address some of the outstanding questions men-
tioned above, we have carried out detailed molecular dy-
namics simulations of four models of glass-forming liquids
with random pinning. These models include the three-
dimensional models considered in our earlier study [23]
and two two-dimensional models. The dependence of
the α-relaxation time, obtained from an overlap func-
tion analogous to the self part of the density autocor-
relation function, on the temperature and the pin con-
centration in the two-dimensional models is found to be
qualitatively similar to that in three dimensions. It was
suggested in Ref. [24] that the relaxation time extracted
from the full density autocorrelation function should be
considered in a check of whether the relaxation time di-
verges at the points at which the conﬁgurational entropy
vanishes according to the numerical results of Ref. [22].
We have calculated the autocorrelation function of the
full density in one of the three-dimensional models (the
Kob-Andersen model [26] which was also considered in
Ref. [22]) and found that the time scale associated with
the decay of this function is actually smaller than that
of the time scale extracted from the overlap function.
Thus, considering the autocorrelation function of the full
density does not resolve the discrepancy between the be-
havior of the relaxation time and the results for the con-
ﬁgurational entropy reported in Ref. [22].

We show that an alternative description proposed in
Ref. [23], based on the assumption that the conﬁgura-
tional entropy of the pinned system diﬀers from that of
the unpinned system by a multiplicative factor that de-
creases from unity as the concentration of pinned par-

2

ticles is increased from zero, allows us to reconcile the
results for the dynamics, as well as new results for the
conﬁgurational entropy of the unpinned systems, with
the RFOT theory. This assumption leads to a scaling de-
scription [23] of the dynamics that involves a new static
length scale ξp associated with the eﬀect of random pin-
ning on the α relaxation time. We show that our data for
the relaxation time for all temperatures and pin concen-
trations considered in our study are consistent with this
scaling description. The relation between the pinning
length scale ξp and the static length scale ξs of RFOT
theory is studied in detail. This allows us to estimate the
values of the exponent θ, associated with the dependence
of the interface free energy on the system size, and the ex-
ponent ψ that describes the dependence of the time scale
on ξs in the RFOT theory. We ﬁnd that θ ≃ d−1 (d is the
spatial dimension), ψ ≃ 1 for the three-dimensional mod-
els considered here. In one of the two-dimensional models
studied here, we ﬁnd that θ ≃ d − 1, ψ ≃ 0.7, whereas
the value of θ estimated for the other two-dimensional
model does not satisfy the bound θ ≤ d − 1. We also
ﬁnd that the static length scale of the RFOT theory is
intimately connected to the fragility, thereby providing
a rationale for the variation of fragility in diﬀerent glass
forming liquids.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we
deﬁne the models studied here and describe the meth-
ods used in our simulations and calculations of quanti-
ties of interest. After a brief review of the predictions
of the RFOT theory for the relationships among diﬀer-
ent dynamic and thermodynamic quantities, such as the
relaxation time (τα), the static length scale (ξs) and the
conﬁgurational entropy density (sc), we present our nu-
merical results and their analysis within the framework of
the RFOT theory using the scaling description proposed
in Ref. [23]. The main results of the scaling analysis for
the exponents appearing in the RFOT theory and the mi-
croscopic origin of the fragility parameter are discussed.
We close with a summary of the main conclusions and
their implications for the validity of the RFOT theory.

II. MODELS AND METHODS

Models: We have studied four diﬀerent model glass
forming liquids in this study – two models each in two and
three dimensions. The ﬁrst model glass former we study
is the well-known Kob- Andersen 80:20 binary Lennard-
Jones mixture in three dimensions. Here it is referred to
as the 3dKA model. The interaction potential in this
model is given by

Vαβ(r) = 4ǫαβ(cid:20)(cid:16) σαβ
r (cid:17)12

−(cid:16) σαβ

r (cid:17)6(cid:21) ,

(1)

where α, β ∈ {A, B} and ǫAA = 1.0, ǫAB = 1.5, ǫBB =
0.5, σAA = 1.0, σAB = 0.80, σBB = 0.88. The interac-
tion potential is cut oﬀ at 2.50σαβ and we use a quadratic

polynomial to make the potential and its ﬁrst two deriva-
tives smooth at the cutoﬀ distance. The temperature
range studied for this model is T ∈ [0.45, 3.00] at num-
ber density ρ = 1.20. The same model with 65:35 com-
position is used in the two dimensional simulations. We
refer to this model as the 2dMKA model. The 65:35
composition is chosen to make sure that the system does
not show any crystalline domains and we checked that
within our maximum simulation time, the system does
not form crystallites in any of the 32 statistically inde-
pendent simulation runs. The second model studied is
a 50:50 binary mixture with a pairwise interactions that
falls oﬀ with distance as an inverse power law,

r (cid:17)n
Vαβ(r) = ǫαβ(cid:16) σαβ

,

(2)

with exponent n = 10 (the 3dR10 model). The
potential is cut oﬀ at 1.38σαβ. We again use a quadratic
polynomial to make the potential and its ﬁrst two
derivative smooth at the cutoﬀ. The parameters of
the potential are: ǫαβ = 1.0, σAA = 1.0, σAB = 1.22
and σBB = 1.40. The temperature range covered
for this model
is T ∈ [0.52, 3.00] at number density
ρ = 0.81. The same model with number density ρ = 0.85
is studied in two dimensions. We will refer to this
model as the 2dR10 model. Length, energy and time

NVT molecular dynamics
Simulation Details:
simulations are performed in a cubic simulation box
with periodic boundary conditions in both two and
three dimensions for all the model systems. We use
the modiﬁed leap-frog algorithm with the Berendsen
thermostat to keep the temperature constant in the
simulation runs. The use of any other thermostat does
not change the results signiﬁcantly as we are mostly
interested in conﬁgurational changes in the system
instead of momentum correlations. The integration
time steps used is dt = 0.005 in this temperature range.
Equilibration runs are performed for ∼ 108 − 109 MD
steps depending on the temperature and production runs
are long enough to ensure that the two-point density
correlation function Q(t) (deﬁned below) goes to zero
within the simulation time. For all the model systems,
we have performed simulations for pin concentration in
the range ρpin ∈ [0.005, 0.200] for each temperature. For
very low temperatures, we were not able to equilibrate
the system for high pin concentrations because of a
dramatic increase in the relaxation time.

Dynamic Correlation Function: Dynamics is char-
acterized by the two point density-density overlap corre-
lation functions Q(t), deﬁned as:

Q(t) =

1

N − Np 

*N −Np
Xi,j=1

w (|~ri(t) − ~rj (0)|)+


,

(3)

where the window function w(x) = 1.0 if x < 0.30, else
w(x) = 0. This choice of window function is made to

3

remove the short-time vibrational component from the
correlation function. Np is the number of pinned particles
in the system and h. . .i implies thermal averaging and
[. . .] means averaging over diﬀerent realizations of the
randomly pinned particles. We have calculated also the
self part of the above correlation function, deﬁned as

Qs(t) =

1

N − Np 


*N −Np
Xi=1

w (|~ri(t) − ~ri(0)|)+


.

(4)

The relaxation time τα was obtained from Qs(t) using
Qs(τα) = exp(−1).

Pinning Protocol: In this study, we have considered
randomly pinned system in which the pinned particles
are chosen randomly from an equilibrium conﬁguration
of the system at the temperature of interest. In [22] a
diﬀerent pinning protocol was used with the constraint
that the pinning sites should be uniformly distributed in
space. This, according to [22], reduces sample to sam-
ple ﬂuctuations. However, in our study where we used
random pinning without any bias, the sample to sam-
ple ﬂuctuations are found to be similar in magnitude to
those when the pinning protocol of Ref. [22] is used. So,
we report here results obtained from simulations of ran-
domly pinned systems in which the pinned particles were
chosen without any bias. It is important to mention that
diﬀerent choices of the pinning protocol actually lead to
somewhat diﬀerent results, but whether the choice qual-
itatively changes the physics is yet to be understood.

The conﬁgurational en-
Conﬁgurational Entropy:
tropy is calculated here only for the unpinned systems
and the per particle entropy is deﬁned as

sc = sbulk − svib

(5)

where sbulk is the bulk entropy calculated via ther-
modynamic integration and svib is the basin entropy
for inherent structures, calculated using the harmonic
approximation[27].
Similar analysis was recently ex-
tended to randomly pinned systems [22], although it
is not clear whether the harmonic approximation is
suﬃciently accurate to get reliable estimates of the
conﬁgurational entropy at
temperatures
considered for the pinned systems [23].

calculated from a combination of ﬁnite-size scaling of the
minimum eigenvalue and point-to-set (PTS) methods as
described in detail in Ref. [28] for the three dimensional
systems. In Ref. [29], it was shown that the length scale
obtained via the methods mentioned above for three di-
mensional systems completely explains the ﬁnite size ef-
fects seen in the relaxation time τα for all temperatures
including high temperatures. So, for the two dimensional
systems, we employed the method of ﬁnite-size scaling of
τα [30] to obtain the static length scales as the eigenvalue

method and PTS methods involve much larger computa-
tional eﬀorts to obtain the length scale. In Fig.1, we have
shown the ﬁnite-size scaling of τα to obtain the static
length scale for both the two dimensional models. The
data collapses observed are quite good and that give us
conﬁdence about the reliability of the values of the ex-
tracted static length scale, ξs. There is a recent contro-
versy about the usefulness of the PTS length scale for
two-dimensional glass forming system with short-range
bond-orientational order [31]. It is claimed that the PTS
correlation length is insensitive to the growth of struc-
tural order in system with pronounced short-range bond-
orientational order and hence the length scale associated
with structural order, which governs the relaxation time,

is not the same as the PTS length scale.
It is to be
noted that this controversy is not relevant for the two-
dimensional systems considered here because local bond-
orientational order is not pronounced in these systems.

III. RANDOM FIRST ORDER TRANSITION

THEORY

The Random First Order Transition (RFOT) [9–
11]theory is motivated by analytic results obtained for
inﬁnite-range spin glass models whose behavior is quali-
tatively similar to that of structural glasses. This theory
connects thermodynamics to dynamics via the conﬁgu-

rational entropy sc. The RFOT theory predicts certain
relationships connecting the α-relaxation time τα(T ), the
static length scale ξs(T ) and the conﬁgurational entropy
sc(T ), with associated exponents which have not yet been
computed from any microscopic theory. The main ingre-
dient of RFOT theory is the introduction of a surface
free energy cost for creating an interface between two
amorphous states of the same glassy system. Unlike con-
ventional liquid-solid interfaces, the free energy cost of
creating an interface between two amorphous states is
somewhat diﬃcult to deﬁne as there is no obvious order
parameter which can distinguish between the two amor-
phous states. Direct measurements of this interfacial free
energy cost have been attempted in the past, but a clear
consensus on its dependence on the size of the interface
is yet to emerge. Thus, a direct measurement of the in-
terfacial free energy and the exponent that describes the
power-law dependence of the free energy on the interface
size would be very important for verifying the validity of
the RFOT theory. In this work, we have tried to extract
some of this information by introducing random pinning
in the system and measuring the corresponding eﬀects on
the dynamics.

Close to the Kauzmann temperature TK, RFOT theory
predicts that the static correlation length ξs(T ) diverges
as

ξs(T ) ∝(cid:20)

1

sc(T )(cid:21)

1

d−θ

.

(6)

where the exponent θ describes the dependence of the
surface free energy cost on the linear size of the interface
between two amorphous states. The α-relaxation time is
related to the static length-scale as

τα = τ0 exp(cid:2)∆ξψ

s /T(cid:3),

where it is assumed that the typical free energy barrier
that has to be overcome in order to rearrange a correlated
volume of linear size ξs is Ea = ∆ξψ
s . Substitution of
Eq.6 in Eq.7 leads to a generalized Adam-Gibbs (AG)
relation,

τα(T ) = τ0 exp" A

# = τ0 exp(cid:20) A
c (cid:21) ,

(8)

where α = ψ/(d − θ). The generalized AG relation,
Eq. 8, reduces to the original AG relation if ψ = d − θ.
In this case, the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) form
for the temperature dependence of τα is recovered if
T sc(T ) goes to zero at the Kauzmann temperature TK
as T Sc(T ) ∝ (T − TK). Here we will work with the gen-
eralized AG relation, Eq. 8, as in [32], it was shown that
the AG relation is violated in two dimensions and the
nature of the deviation from the AG relation depends
on the speciﬁc details of the model system studied. For
a system that satisﬁes the generalized AG relation with
α 6= 1, the temperature dependence of τα would be de-
scribed by the VFT equation if T Sα
c ∝ (T − TK) for T
close to TK.

IV. RANDOM PINNING: SCALING

ARGUMENTS

In Ref. [18], it was argued that the Kauzmann temper-
ature TK where the conﬁgurational entropy sc goes to
zero should increase with increasing concentration ρpin
of pinned particles. In Ref. [21], TK was estimated by
ﬁtting the relaxation time τα as a function of tempera-
ture to the VFT formula for diﬀerent values of ρpin.For
many glass forming liquids without random pinning, TK
turns out to be close to the extrapolated VFT divergence
temperature TV F T . It was observed [21] that the TV F T
obtained from the ﬁts does not increase with increasing
pin concentration. Instead, the kinetic fragility decreases
drastically as ρpin is increased. This behavior is in con-
tradiction with the prediction in [18]. On the other hand,
in Ref. [22], TK was estimated by calculating the conﬁgu-
rational entropy (using a harmonic approximation for the
basin entropy) and it was found that TK increases with
increasing pin concentration. Based on this observation,
the existence of an ideal glass state beyond a “critical”
pin concentration was predicted. However, it has been
shown explicitly in Refs. [21] and [23] that the self over-
lap function Qs(t) and the self-intermediate scattering
function decay to zero in time scales accessible in sim-
ulations even at state points where the conﬁgurational
entropy is zero according to Ref [22]. This proves that
the α relaxation time remains ﬁnite [23] at the ideal glass
state points obtained in Ref. [22]. This observation is in
agreement with the ﬁnding in Ref. [21] that TV F T does
not increase with increasing ρpin.

A possible explanation of this discrepancy between the
results for the dynamics and the conﬁgurational entropy
was suggested in Ref. [24] where it was argued that one
should extract the relaxation time from the total density
correlation function instead of its self part. According
to this argument, the total and self correlation functions
decouple from each other as one increases the concentra-
tion of pinned particles and the relaxation time extracted
from the total correlation function may diverge as sc goes
to zero, even if the time scale obtained from the self part
remains ﬁnite. To test the validity of this argument, we
have calculated the relaxation time from the total overlap
correlation function for the 3dKA model at state points
close the phase boundary in the (ρpin −T ) plane obtained
in Ref. [22].
In Fig.2, we have plotted the full overlap
correlation function and its self part for two state points
near the phase boundary of Ref. [22] and extracted relax-
ation times from ﬁts of the long-time data to a stretched
exponential function. Since the full correlation function
does not go to zero at long times (due to the presence of
the random potential produced by the pinned particles),
its long time value, Q(∞), was obtained from the ﬁts and
the quantity [Q(t)−Q(∞)/[1−Q(∞)], which decays from
one to zero as t is increased from zero to ∞, was used to
obtain the relaxation time. The time scale obtained from
the total overlap correlation function is found to be of the
same order of magnitude, but smaller than that obtained

from the self part. A similar conclusion was obtained
from an analysis of the data for full and self correlation
functions given in Ref. [24]. Thus, the discrepancy be-
tween the dynamics and the results for sc(T ) reported
in [22] can not be resolved by considering the time scale
obtained from the full density correlation function.

Here we will follow the arguments provided in Ref. [23]
for understanding the dynamics of randomly pinned sys-
tems and use these arguments to analyze the simulation
results obtained in the present study for both two and
three dimensional glass forming liquids. In Ref. [23], it
was shown that the observed simulation results can be
rationalized if one assumes that the AG relation or its
generalized form remains valid [20] in the presence of
pinning and the dependence of sc on T and ρpin is of the

form

T sα

c (T, ρpin) = T sα

c (T, 0)F (T, ρpin)

= K(T − TK)F (T, ρpin),

(9)

where F (T, ρpin), the fractional reduction of the conﬁgu-
rational entropy due to pinning, decreases from 1 as ρpin
is increased from 0. This is consistent with the general
expectation of sc being a decreasing function of ρpin. In
Eq. 9, α is the RFOT exponent deﬁned in Eq. 8 and the
second line follows from the expectation (veriﬁed in our
simulations) that the the temperature dependence of τα
follows the VFT form. If the temperature dependence of
F (T, ρpin) is weak (we ignore the dependence of F on T
in the following discussion), then Eq.( 9) and the general-
ized Adam-Gibbs relation lead to the following expression
for τα for non-zero ρpin:

τα(ρpin, T ) = τ∞ exp(cid:20)

B(ρpin)
F (ρpin)T sα

c (0, T )(cid:21) .

(10)

This equation predicts a VFT form for the temperature
dependence of τα, with TV F T = TK independent of ρpin,
in agreement with the observations in Ref. [23]. The
fragility parameter KV F T = KTV F T F (ρpin)/B(ρpin)
would decrease with increasing ρpin (i.e. would agree
with our observations) if F/B is a decreasing function
of ρpin. This condition would be satisﬁed if B increases,
remains constant or decreases slower than F with increas-
ing ρpin.

Following arguments similar to those in Ref. [23], it is
easy to show that Eq. 10 leads to the following scaling
relation for small values of ρpin:

ln(cid:20) τα(ρpin, T )

τα(0, T ) (cid:21) = Cf (ρpinξd

p(T ))

(11)

with f (x) = x and the pinning length scale ξp is given by

ξp(T ) = [1/(T sα

c (0, T ))]1/d ∝ [1/(T − TV F T )]1/d

(12)

where d is the spatial dimension.

This scaling prediction was tested and veriﬁed in
Ref. [23] for both the three dimensional models consid-
ered here. As shown in Fig. 3, it is possible to collapse
all the data for ψ(ρpin, T ) ≡ ln[τα(ρpin, T )/τα(0, T )] for
each of the two dimensional models into a single scaling
curve by choosing the length scale ξp(T ) appropriately for
diﬀerent temperatures. The scaling function, represented
by the line passing through the collapsed data points, is
indeed of the form predicted by the scaling argument.

To check whether the ξp(T ) obtained from the scal-
ing collapse is proportional to [1/(T − TV F T )]1/d, we
have plotted in Fig.
4 the pinning length scale ξp ob-
tained from the scaling collapse in Fig. 3 as a function
of (T − TV F T ) for all the model systems. The results
are clearly consistent with the predicted behavior. Thus,
the scaling description proposed in Ref. [23] provides a
consistent description of the simulation data in both two
and three dimensions.

It follows from Eq. 6 and Eq. 12 that

T ξd

p(T ) =

sα
c (0, T )

∝ ξψ

s (0, T ).

(13)

Thus, the data for ξp(T ) and ξs(0, T ) can be used to
estimate the RFOT exponent ψ.

In Fig.5, ln(T ξd

p ) is plotted versus ln(ξs) for all the four
models considered here. The exponent ψ obtained from
the slope of this plot turns out to be close to unity for
the two models studied in three dimensions. The best
ﬁt values, indicated by straight lines in the ﬁgure, are
ψ = 0.967 for the 3dKA model and ψ = 1.07 for the
3dR10 model. The observation [32] that the AG relation

is obeyed in both three dimensional models implies that
α = ψ/(d − θ) = 1 in three dimensions. This result, in
combination of the result for ψ, imply that θ ≃ 2.0 in
three dimensions. Our data for the dependence of ξs on
sc are also consistent with Eq.6. In Fig.6, ξs is plotted as
a function of 1/sc for both the model systems and Eq.6
with (d−θ) obtained from the relation ψ = d−θ provides
a good description of the data for the three dimensional
model systems.

For the two dimensional models, the AG relation is
violated [32] and the relation α = ψ/(d − θ) = 1 is not
satisﬁed. We have obtained the exponent ψ from Eq.13
and ψ/(d − θ) from the modiﬁed AG relation. For the
2dMKA model, ψ ≃ 0.70 (see Fig. 5), when only the low
temperature data are considered and ψ/(d − θ) ≃ 0.70
from the generalized AG plot shown in Fig. 7. Thus,

FIG. 6: The static length scale ξs is plotted as a function of
1/sc for all the four model systems. The solid lines are ﬁts
to the form ξs ∝ (1/sc)1/(d−θ) with d − θ obtained from the

ﬁts shown in Fig. 5, α = 1 for the three dimensional models
and α for the two dimensional models are obtained from the
ﬁts shown in Fig. 7.

the relation sα
c (T ) ∝ (T − TK) is satisﬁed by the data
with α = 3.0. However, the value of θ violates the phys-
ically expected condition, θ ≤ d − 1. Thus, although the
exponent values ψ ≃ 0.89, α ≃ 3.0, θ ≃ 1.70 provide an
internally consistent description of the simulation data,
the value of θ turns out to be unphysical. This unphysi-
cal value of θ is a consequence of the rather large value of
α. For θ to be less than (d− 1) in two dimensions, the ex-
ponents ψ and α must satisfy the inequality α < ψ. This
is clearly ruled out by the data. The value of α reported
in Ref. [32] for the 2dR10 model (α ≃ 2.1) would also
lead to a value of θ (≃ 1.5) that is higher than (d − 1).

θ ≃ 1.0 for this model. In the ξs vs 1/sc plot in Fig. 6,
θ ≃ 1.0 describes the data quite well. Also, the relation
sα
c (T ) ∝ (T − TK), required for the validity of the VFT
form, is satisﬁed for α = 0.70, as shown in Fig. 8.

For the 2dR10 model, ψ ≃ 0.89 from Fig. 5 if only the
low temperature data are considered. A smaller value of
ψ (∼ 0.75) is obtained if the data for a wider range of
temperature are used in the power-law ﬁt. The modiﬁed
AG relation gives α = ψ/(d − θ) ≃ 3.0 (see Fig. 7).This
implies θ ≃ 1.70. The data for ξs and 1/sc are consistent
with the expected relation between these two quantities
with d − θ ≃ 0.29 (see Fig.6). Also, as shown in Fig. 8,

As discussed in the Introduction, kinetic fragility mea-
sures the rate at which the relaxation time changes
with decreasing temperature. The role of fragility can
be clearly demonstrated by plotting the relaxation time
scaled by its inﬁnite temperature value as a function of
the temperature scaled by E∞, the high temperature ac-
tivation energy scale obtained by ﬁtting the high temper-
ature relaxation time data to the Arrhenius form,

the data for all the systems fall on a single master curve
which would be a straight line if ln(τα/τ∞) is plotted as
a function of E∞/T . Deviations from this straight line at
lower temperatures would highlight the varying degree of
fragility of these diﬀerent systems. In the left panels of
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, one can clearly see that the relaxation
time data at high temperatures fall on a straight line.
Values of the parameters E∞ and τ∞, obtained from ﬁts
of the high-temperature data to the Arrhenius form of
Eq. 14 are given in Table I for all the models considered
here. The data for systems with diﬀerent values of ρpin
deviate from this straight line by diﬀerent amounts at
low temperatures. The unpinned system deviates the
most and the system with ρpin = 0.20 shows the least
amount of deviation, illustrating a decrease of fragility
with increasing pin density.

If the relaxation time τα is determined solely by the
static length scale ξs, as in Eq. 7 with ∆ a system depen-
dent constant, then one would expect that the fragility
will also be completely determined by the growth of the

function of ξψ
s (T, ρpin)/T should collapse to a straight
line at low temperatures. This possibility is checked be-
low by approximately calculating the static length scale
for diﬀerent pin densities. The objective here is to exam-
ine whether the observed fragility change with increasing
pin concentration can be understood as an eﬀect of a
pinning-induced change in the temperature dependence
of the static length scale.

We start from our proposal for the dependence of
the conﬁgurational entropy on pin concentration, Eq.9.
For small pin concentrations, ρpin → 0, we can express
F (ρpin) as F (ρpin) = 1 − Cρpin + . . . , C > 0 and the
corresponding conﬁgurational entropy as

sc(ρpin, T ) = sc(0, T )(1 − Cρpin).

(15)

Now, assuming that the RFOT relation between the
static length scale and the conﬁgurational entropy (Eq. 6)

remains valid for pinned systems, we can write

ξs(ρpin, T ) ∝ (cid:20)

1

T sc(ρpin, T )(cid:21)1/(d−θ)
T sc(0, T )(cid:21)

= D(ρpin)(cid:20)

(16)

with D(ρpin) = 1 + Aρpin + . . . , A > 0. Thus, we have

ξs(ρpin, T ) = ξs(0, T )(1 + Aρpin).

(17)

As discussed earlier, the static length scale for ρpin = 0
for the three dimensional models is obtained from a com-
bination of ﬁnite size scaling analysis of the minimum
eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix and PTS analysis (see
[28] for further details). Finite size scaling of τα is used
to extract the static length scale for the two dimensional

model systems studied here. Once the length scale at
zero pinning is obtained, Eq.17 is used to obtain the static
length scale for diﬀerent pin densities, treating A as a sys-
tem dependent constant. This length scale is then used
to obtain the data collapse in Figs. 9 and 10. The value
of A for each model system is determined by maximizing
the quality of data collapse. The collapse of the τα data
for varying levels of pinning is observed to be quite good
within our numerical accuracy. The data for the larger
values of ρpin, ρpin ∈ {16%, 20%} could not be collapsed
for the 3dKA model, suggesting that in this case, one
may need to include higher order terms in Eq.17. This
analysis suggests a deep connection between the static
length scale and the fragility in diﬀerent glass forming
liquids.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this article we have presented results from extensive
computer simulations of the dynamics of several model
glass forming liquids in the presence of random pinning
in both two and three dimensions. The eﬀects of random
pinning on the dynamics of two dimensional systems are
found to be qualitatively similar to those reported ear-
lier [23] for three dimensional model glass formers. The
presence of random pinning does not lead to an increase
in the VFT temperature TV F T , but increases the kinetic
fragility of the liquids, irrespective of the model and the
spatial dimension considered in the simulation. We have
tried to understand the observed behavior within the
framework of the RFOT theory and provided a scaling
description that explains our simulation results for the
dependence of the α relaxation time and the fragility on

the pin concentration.

The main results of this work are:

• The fragility of a glass forming liquid can be tuned
systematically over a large range by pinning a ran-
domly chosen subset of the particles in their equi-
librium positions. This eﬀect is generic for glass
forming liquids in both two and three dimensions.

• We ﬁnd that pinning induced changes in the tem-
perature dependence of the α relaxation time τα
can be explained entirely in terms of the de-
pendence of the static length scale of RFOT,
ξs(T, ρpin), on the pin concentration ρpin. This ob-
servation implies that the kinetic fragility is inti-
mately connected with the static length scale. In
particular, the RFOT relationship between τα and

ξs, τα = τ0 exp(cid:0)∆ξψ

s /T(cid:1) describes the data quite

well and appears to be universal in nature.

• A scaling description, consistent with the RFOT
theory and based on the assumption that random
pinning changes the conﬁgurational entropy by a
multiplicative factor that decreases from unity as
the pin concentration is increased from zero, pro-
vides a good description of all simulation results
for the dynamics. This description reveals the ex-
istence of a pinning-related static length scale, ξp.
The dynamics of supercooled liquids with random
pinning can be completely understood in terms of
this length scale and the other static length scale,
ξs. A scaling argument suggests the existence of
a simple relation between these two length scales
and gives us an opportunity to extract one of the
exponents (the barrier height exponent ψ) of RFOT
theory from the simulation data.

12

• Combining the results for ψ with those for the ex-
ponent α in the generalized AG relation, we can
extract the value of the RFOT surface tension ex-
ponent θ. Our results for the three dimensional
models are consistent with θ = (d − 1), ψ = 1.
In one of the two dimensional models (the 2dMKA
model), we ﬁnd θ ≃ d−1, ψ ≃ 0.7. In the other two
dimensional model (the 2dR10 model), the value of
ψ is found to be close to 1, but the value of θ > 1.0
violates the inequality θ ≤ (d − 1). This suggests
that the RFOT description is not applicable to this
system. Our results for the two dimensional sys-
tems are consistent with earlier observation [32] of
breakdown of the AG relation and lack of univer-
sality in two dimensions. This may be related to
recent results [33] suggesting that the behavior of
glass forming liquids in two dimensions is qualita-
tively diﬀerent from that observed in three dimen-
sions.

• Relations among the static length scale ξs, the con-
ﬁgurational entropy sc and the α relaxation time
τα predicted in the RFOT theory are satisﬁed by
our simulation results with the obtained exponent
values.

In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrate that
many of the simulation results for the dynamics of dif-
ferent glass forming liquids in the presence of random
pinning can be understood within the framework of the
RFOT theory and random pinning provides an interest-
ing tool to unravel several aspects of glassy dynamics.
More simulational and experimental research along these
lines will be very useful.
