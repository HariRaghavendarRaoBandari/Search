Abstract
A giant planet creates a gap in a protoplanetary disk, which might explain the observed gaps
in protoplanetary disks. The width and depth of the gaps depend on the planet mass and disk
properties. We have performed two–dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for various planet
masses, disk aspect ratios and viscosities, to obtain an empirical formula for the gap width.
The gap width is proportional to the square root of the planet mass, −3/4 power of the disk
aspect ratio and −1/4 power of the viscosity. This empirical formula enables us to estimate the
mass of a planet embedded in the disk from the width of an observed gap. We have applied
the empirical formula for the gap width to the disk around HL Tau, assuming that each gap
observed by ALMA observations is produced by planets, and discussed the planet masses
within the gaps. The estimate of planet masses from the gap widths is less affected by the
observational resolution and dust ﬁltration than that from the gap depth.

1 Introduction

Recent observations of protoplanetary disks have shown that
disks with non–axisymmetric structures (e.g., Casassus et al.
2013; Fukagawa et al. 2013; van der Marel et al. 2013; P´erez
et al. 2014) and/or gap structures (e.g.,Osorio et al. 2014;
ALMA Partnership 2015). One possible origin of these struc-
tures are the dynamic interaction between the disk and embed-
ded planets (Lin & Papaloizou 1979; Goldreich & Tremaine

1980; Lin & Papaloizou 1993). A large planet embedded in
a disk produces a gap around its orbit. The planet mass and the
disk properties are reﬂected in the gap width and depth. It is
important to construct a model of a gap that can predict a planet
mass.

Recent studies on the gap formation (e.g.,Duffell &
MacFadyen 2013; Kanagawa et al. 2015a; Kanagawa et al.
2015b, hereafter Paper I) have revealed that the gap depth is

related with the planetary mass, the disk aspect ratio (tempera-
ture), and the viscosity, as

where Σmin and Σ0 are the surface densities at the bottom of the
gap and the edge, respectively. The dimensionless parameter K
is deﬁned by

K ≡(cid:16) Mp

M∗(cid:17)2(cid:18) hp

Rp(cid:19)−5

where, Mp, M∗, Rp, hp α are the masses of the planet and
the central star, the orbital radius of the planet, the scale height
at Rp, and the viscous parameter with the prescription by
Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, respectively. The gap depth given
by Equation (1) agrees well with the results of the hydrody-
namic simulations (Varni`ere et al. 2004; Duffell & MacFadyen
2013; Fung et al. 2014).

As seen from Equation (1), the gap depth is determined by
the dimensionless parameter K, which is a function of Mp, hp
and α. Hence, the planet mass can be estimated from the depth
of the observed gap if the disk aspect ratio and the viscosity
are given. Paper I applied Equation (1) to a gap of the HL Tau
disk observed by the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign (ALMA
Partnership 2015) and estimated that the lower–limit of the
mass of the planet within the gap at 30AU is 0.3MJ if this gap is
originated from the disk–planet interaction. It is, however, very
difﬁcult to estimate the mass of a planet in a deep gap because
the emission at the bottom of the gap should be measured with a
reasonable signal–to–noise ratio. In contrast, the gap width can
be more easily measured than the gap depth.

It

is known that

the width of the gap induced by a
planet increases with the planet mass (Takeuchi et al. 1996;
Varni`ere et al. 2004; Duffell & MacFadyen 2013; Duffell 2015).
However, a quantitative relationship between the gap width and
the planet mass is not clear. Varni`ere et al. 2004 reported that
if (Mp/M∗)2(hp/Rp)−2α−1 >
0.3, the gap edges are between
∼
the locations of the m = 2 and 1 outer Lindblad resonances. If
Keplerian rotation is assumed, the distances between the planet
and the m = 2 and 1 outer Lindblad resonances are 0.31Rp and
0.59Rp , respectively (Goldreich & Tremaine 1980). On the
other hand, the hydrodynamic simulations performed by Duffell
& MacFadyen 2013 shows that narrower gaps are created. The
half width of the gap given by Duffell & MacFadyen 2013 is be-
low 0.23Rp even if (Mp/M∗)2(hp/Rp)−2α−1 > 0.3 (see ﬁg-
ure 6 of their paper). Further investigation have been required
in order to constrain the planet mass from the width of the ob-
served gaps.

and the empirical formula for the gap width. We apply the for-
mula to estimate the masses of the planets in the observed gaps
of the HL Tau disk in Section 4. Section 5 is for summary.

2 Numerical method

We study the shape of the gap induced by a planet embedded in
a protoplanetary disk using the two–dimensional hydrodynamic
code FARGO (Masset 2000), which is widely used to study the
disk–planet interaction (e.g.,Crida & Morbidelli 2007; Baruteau
et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2011). The computational domain ranges
from R/Rp = 0.4 to 4.0 with 1024× 2048 radial and azimuthal
zones. The disk scale height, h, is resolved by 22 (radial) and
16 (azimuthal) zones in the vicinity of the planet. For simplic-
ity, we neglect the gas accretion onto the planet and the planets
rotates on the ﬁxed orbit with R = Rp. We adopt a constant
kinematic viscosity coefﬁcient ν, which is ν = αcphp, (Shakura
& Sunyaev 1973), where cp is sound speed at R = Rp. The
disk aspect ratio h/R is also set to be a constant throughout the
disk. We adopted a smoothing length for a gravitational poten-
tial of a planet as 0.6hp. We have checked that the choice of the
smoothing length does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the gap width.
We perform 26 runs of the hydrodynamic simulation for var-
ious planetary masses (0.1MJ – 2MJ , if M∗ = 1M⊙), disk as-
pect ratios (1/30 – 1/15) and the parameter α of the viscosity
(10−2 – 10−4), which are listed in Table 1. In this work, we fol-
low 104 – 105 orbits at the planet’s location to reach the steady
state. In the cases with α = 10−4, a very long time, i.e., ∼ 105
planetary orbits, is required to obtain the steady gap width. Such
long calculations are necessary because of the slow viscous evo-
lution in the less viscous disk.

Initially, the surface density is constant (Σ(R) = Σ0) in
the whole region. The initial angular velocity is given as
ΩK√1 − η, where ΩK is the Keplerian angular velocity and
η = (1/2)(h/R)2dlnP/dlnR. The radial drift velocity is given
by vR = −3ν/(2R). The planet mass smoothly builds up from
zero to the ﬁnal value by using the ramp function deﬁned by
sin2 [πt/ (64Porbit)].

At the inner and outer boundaries(R/Rp = 0.4 and 4.0), we
keep the initial condition described above. In addition, we intro-
duce wave-killing zones near the boundaries (0.4 < R/Rp < 0.5
and 3.2 < R/Rp < 4.0) to avoid artiﬁcial wave reﬂection at the
boundaries (de Val-Borro et al. 2006).

3.1 Empirical formula for the gap width

In this Paper, we derive an empirical relationship between
the gap width and the planet mass, performing 26 runs of two–
dimensional hydrodynamic simulation.
In Section 2, we de-
scribe the numerical method. In Section 3, we show our results

Rout and Rin are the radii of the outer and inner edges of the
gap region. Note that we can make a reasonable guess of the
gap width from only the snapshot of the simulations (or obser-
vations) since the surface density approaches Σ0 outside the gap
region. The gap width in the case of 1.0MJ (∆gap = 0.69Rp) is
∼ 80% larger than that in the case of 0.3MJ (∆gap = 0.39Rp).

As seen from Equation (4), the gap width depends weakly
on the planet mass and the viscosity, which is consistent with
previous studies (Varni`ere et al. 2004; Duffell & MacFadyen
2013) . We also ﬁnd that the disk aspect ratio affects the gap
width as h−3/4

and hp/Rp, as compared with α. Hence, if ∆gap and hp/Rp
are measured accurately from high resolution observations, the
planet mass can be well constrained. Note that Equation (5)
should be applied to the gap whose Σmin is smaller than 0.45Σ0
which is the depth of the most shallow gap in Figure 3.

The gap width given by Equation (4) is reasonably consis-
tent with that given by hydrodynamic simulations by Varni`ere
et al. 2004 and Duffell & MacFadyen 2013. Their results have
larger scatter, which may be partly due to the short computa-
tional time. More detail discussions on our simulations will be

described in a forthcoming paper (Kanagawa et al. in prepara-
tion).

3.2 Test for the gap formation induced by the planet

The mass of the planet in the gap can be estimated from the gap
width (Equation (4)) or the depth (Equation (1)). If the width
and depth give the same planet mass, it is supported that the gap
is formed by a planet. Combining Equations (1) and (4), we
obtain the relationship among the gap width, the depth and the
disk aspect ratio as

∆gap

Rp (cid:16) Σmin

Σ0 − Σmin(cid:17)1/4(cid:18) hp

Rp(cid:19)−1/2

= 0.92.

(6)

This should be satisﬁed for a gap created by a planet. Note
that Equation (6) contains only observable quantities since the
aspect ratio can be also estimated by the observed disk temper-
ature. When the gap width and depth are precisely observed in
gas emission, Equation (6) enables us to judge whether the gap
is created by the planet. For the observation of the dust thermal
emission, the mass estimate from the gap width (Equation (5))
is still useful as long as dust particles are well coupled to the
gas, as discussed in the next section.

4 Application to HL Tau disk

Recently, clear axisymmetric gaps in HL Tau disk are dis-
covered in the dust thermal emission by the Long Baseline
Campaign of ALMA (ALMA Partnership 2015). Recent hy-
drodynamic simulations can reproduce the observational image
of HL Tau disk by the disk–planet interaction (e.g., Dong et al.
2015; Dipierro et al. 2015; Picogna & Kley 2015; Jin et al.
2016). In Paper I, we applied Equation (1) to estimate the planet
mass for the HL Tau disk.
In this study, Equation (4) is ap-
plied to the widths of the observed gap. As done in Paper I,
using the brightness temperatures in Band 6 and 7, we obtain
the optical depth in Band 6 and the gas temperature for the

assumed spectral index β (Figure 4). The disk aspect ratio is
calculated from the temperature by h/R = c/(RΩK ), where
c = 105(T /300K)1/2cm/s. We assume that the mass of the cen-
tral star is 1M⊙. We identify three prominent gaps in the optical
depth at R = 10AU, 30AU and 80AU in Figure 4b. Although the
gap at 80AU can be regarded as two gaps, Dipierro et al. 2015
pointed out that this structure can be considered as one gap with
remaining dust in the horseshoe region. Thus, we assume that
the 80AU gap is created by a single planet.

The optical depth outside the gaps can be ﬁtted by τ unp =
9.5(R/1AU)−0.4 in Figure 4b. We regard τ unp as the unper-
turbed surface density to measure the gap width. Note that the
opacity is assumed to be constant throughout the disk. The loca-
tions of the inner and outer gap edges, Rin and Rout, are deter-
mined by intersection points with τ unp/2 and measure the gap
width as Rout − Rin. The location of the planet, Rp, is simply
estimated as (Rin + Rout)/2.

We assume that the gap widths of the gas and dust disks are

We set α = 10−3, β = 1.5 and M∗ = 1M⊙ at the evaluation in this
table.

similar. That is, it is assumed that dust particles are reasonably
coupled to the disk gas and thus the dust ﬁltration is weak. If
the dust ﬁltration is strong, the dust surface density is enhanced
at the outer edge of the gap by orders of magnitude and sig-
niﬁcantly reduced at the inner part of the disk (e.g.,Zhu et al.
2012; Dong et al. 2015; Picogna & Kley 2015).
In the case
of relatively weak ﬁltration, on the other hand, the gap widths
of the dust disk is not altered much (see Figure 3 of Zhu et al.
2012). Because no signiﬁcant pile–up of dust is found at the
outer edge of each gap in Figure 4b, the assumption of the weak
dust ﬁltration would be valid for the HL Tau disk. Dong et al.
2015 also estimated the mass of the planets in the HL Tau disk
by using hydrodynamic simulations that include dust ﬁltration
for α = 10−3 and Mdisk = 0.17M⊙. Their result indeed shows
that the gap width of millimeter–sized dust particles is similar
(within a factor of 2) to that of small particles tightly coupled to
the gas because of relatively weak dust ﬁltration in the massive
disk of HL Tau (see Figure 10 of Dong et al. 2015), though the
gap depth is much affected even in the case of the weak ﬁltra-
tion. Hence the gap width of the dust disk is more suitable for
estimate of the planet mass than the gap depth of the dust disk.
In addition, for particles smaller than millimeter–sized particles,
gap widths (and gap depths) in gas and dust are more similar to
each other. Jin et al. 2016 have also performed hydrodynamic
simulations with 0.15 millimeter–sized particles in similar sit-
uation of Dong et al. 2015 (α = 10−3 and Mdisk = 0.08M⊙)
and reproduced the observed image of HL Tau disk. In their
simulations, the gap widths in gas and dust are very similar.

Table 2 shows the properties of the observed gaps and the
estimated planet masses. In this table, we set β = 1.5 to obtain
the optical depth and the aspect ratio, and adopt α = 10−3 for
estimate of the planet masses. The planet masses for the gaps at
10AU, 30AU and 80AU are estimated to be 1.4MJ , 0.2MJ and
0.5MJ from the gap widths, respectively. The estimated mass
of the planet at 30AU gap is consistent with that estimated from
the gap depth in Paper I.

We should note that the gap properties and the estimated
masses depend on β, as seen in Figure 4b. The radiative transfer
model of Pinte et al. 2016 implies that β ≃ 1. For the innermost
gap, the planet mass is estimated to be 3.3MJ (1.3MJ ) if β = 1
(2) from the gap width. For the 80AU gap, the gap width is
much more affected by the choice of β. The disk aspect ra-

tio can be inﬂuenced by the choice of β, which may not be
neglected because the planet mass relatively strongly depends
on the disk aspect ratio (Mp ∝ (hp/Rp)3/2, see Equation (5)).
For instance, the disk aspect ratio at the outer most gap can be
changed from 0.08 to 0.11 if we vary β from 2.0 to 1.5 (see
Figure 4c). In this case, the estimated mass of the planet can be
changed from 0.35MJ to 0.57MJ . Therefore, accurate estimate
of β is essential in deriving the planet mass from the gap shape.
Future multi–frequency and high spatial resolution observations
may constrain the planet mass better.

The location of the planet (Rp) can affect the mass estimate
because the gap width is scaled by Rp in Equation (5). Although
we simply estimate Rp as (Rin + Rout)/2 by assuming a sym-
metric gap, Rp can be changed because the actual shape of the
gap is slightly non–symmetric. Indeed, for instance, Rp for the
innermost planet is set to be ∼ 13AU in the previous simula-
tions, which slightly larger than that in Table 2. If Rp = 13AU
is adopted, the estimated mass of the planet is slightly smaller
(1.1MJ ) than that in Table 2.

In addition to β and Rp, the planet mass can also depend on
the choice of the viscous parameter α, which is highly uncer-
tain. However, the estimate of the planet mass varies only α1/2
(see Equation 5) and therefore, the dependency of the planet
mass on the viscous parameter is not very strong.

The relatively narrow 10AU and 30AU gaps are only
marginally resolved with the observation. As seen in Figure 2,
each gap width measured at the level of Σ0/2 is wider than that
of the bottom region, which determines the gap depth. For the
marginally resolved gap, the gap width can be accurately mea-
sured as compared with the minimum surface density of the gap.
Hence mass estimate from the gap width is less affected by the
resolution.

Dong et al. 2015 estimated the planet masses to be 0.2MJ
for these three gaps of the HL Tau disk from their hydrodynamic
simulations, by including dust ﬁltration. Their result is consis-
tent with our estimate for the 30AU gap. For 10AU gap, our
estimated mass is much larger than their result. This is prob-
ably because quantitative comparison between the model and
observations is not the main focus of their work. In their model,
the gap width of millimeter–sized dust particles is ∼ 5AU (see
their Figure 10), which is about half of our measured width for
the 10AU gap of the HL Tau disk. If the gap width is half, the
planet mass estimated from the width is 4 times smaller (see
Equation (5)). This partially explains the difference between
ours and theirs. We also ﬁnd that the difference of a factor of
2.5 in the planet mass estimate for the 80AU gap. It may be due
to the uncertainty in β.

Adopting 0.15 millimeter–sized particles, Jin et al. 2016
have also estimated similar masses of the planets to Dong et al.
2015 (0.35MJ , 0.17MJ and 0.26MJ for the innermost, middle
and outermost gaps). Their estimated masses of the planets are

smaller than these given by our estimate (Table 2), because they
assumed the mass of the central star as 0.55M⊙ which is smaller
than that adopted in Table 2 (1M⊙). Adopting M∗ = 0.55M⊙,
we estimate the masses of the planets as 0.77MJ , 0.11MJ and
0.28MJ for the innermost, middle and outermost gaps. For
the middle and outermost gaps, the estimated planet masses are
quite similar to the result of Jin et al. 2016. For the innermost
gap, our estimate gives the same mass of the planet as their
result if the gap width is narrower in only ∼ 2AU than that mea-
sured from Figure 4b.

Dipierro et al. 2015 also derived the planet masses from a hy-
drodynamic simulations similar to Dong et al. 2015, but by as-
suming a much less massive disk as Mdisk = 0.0002M⊙. Their
result shows a strong ﬁltration at shallow gaps for millimeter–
sized particles (Figure 3 of Dipierro et al. 2015), in contrast to
Dong et al. 2015 and Jin et al. 2016. This is reasonable be-
cause dust ﬁltration is stronger for a less massive disk since the
coupling between the gas and dust is weaker. However, the ob-
servations suggest that the disk mass should be ∼ 0.1M⊙ for
the HL Tau disk if gas–to–dust mass ratio is ∼ 100 (Robitaille
et al. 2007; ALMA Partnership 2015).

5 Summary

We have derived an empirical formula for the gap width
(Equation (4)), by performing 26 runs of hydrodynamic sim-
ulation. The gap width is expressed as a power–law function of
the planet mass, the disk aspect ratio, and the viscosity. This
empirical formula enables us to estimate the planet mass from
the gap width. Paper I presented the relationship between the
gap depth and the planet mass as Equation (1). If the gap is cre-
ated by the planet, the masses estimated by Equations (1) and
(4) should be consistent, and the gap width and the gap depth
should satisfy Equation (6). With this, it is possible to check
whether the gap is created by a planet when the gap width and
depth are accurately observed in the gas emission. For the dust
thermal emission, if dust ﬁltration is not very effective, estimate
of planet mass from the gap width is still useful because the gap
widths in the gas and dust disks are not so different.

We have applied the empirical formula for the gap width to
the gaps in the HL Tau disk observed in dust thermal emission
by ALMA. We have estimated the mass of planets in the gaps at
10AU, 30AU and 80AU as 1.4MJ , 0.2MJ and 0.5MJ , respec-
tively, assuming M∗ = 1M⊙. For the innermost gap, the whole
structure may not be completely resolved by the observation
and measuring the gap depth is difﬁcult. The dust ﬁltration al-
ters the gap depth more than the gap width. The estimate form
the gap width gives us a more accurate planet mass than that
from the gap depth. Our estimate depends on the particle size
of dusts (i.e., the dust opacity index of β) and the disk model
for the dust ﬁltration. More sophisticated models in the HL Tau

disk would improve the above estimates of the planet mass. If
the gap is observed in gas emission, we can constrain a planet
mass from the gap depth and width, without uncertainty of the
dust and disk models.
