TURBULENCE GENERATED PROTON-SCALE STRUCTURES IN THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETOSHEATH

Draft version March 2, 2016

ABSTRACT

Recent results of numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations suggest that in collisionless space
plasmas turbulence can spontaneously generate thin current sheets. These coherent structures can
partially explain intermittency and the non-homogenous distribution of localized plasma heating in
turbulence. In this Letter Cluster multi-point observations are used to investigate the distribution
of magnetic ﬁeld discontinuities and the associated small-scale current sheets in the terrestrial mag-
netosheath downstream of a quasi-parallel bow shock. It is shown experimentally, for the ﬁrst time,
that the strongest turbulence generated current sheets occupy the long tails of probability distribution
functions (PDFs) associated with extremal values of magnetic ﬁeld partial derivatives. During the
analyzed one hour long time interval, about a hundred strong discontinuities, possibly proton-scale
current sheets were observed.
Subject headings: plasma turbulence – magnetic ﬁeld – discontinuities

1. INTRODUCTION

Downstream of the terrestrial bow shock (BS) the
super-sonic and super-Alfv´enic solar wind ﬂow slows
down, gets compressed and heated. The solar wind is
diverted by the strong geomagnetic ﬁeld at the magne-
topause (MP). The magnetosheath (MS) is the region
between the BS and the MP, where the ﬁeld and plasma
ﬂuctuations are rather strong. Numerical simulations
(Omidi et al. 2014; Karimabadi et al. 2014) demonstrate
the complexity of this region - being populated by vari-
ous interacting multi-scale structures, such as ﬁlaments,
vortices, current sheets, plasma jets and ﬂows.
In-situ
measurements from diﬀerent missions also revealed the
existence of nonlinear structures in upstream and down-
stream BS regions, for example, shocklets (Hoppe et al.
1981), short duration large amplitude magnetic struc-
tures (SLAMS) (Lucek et al. 2004), and hot-ﬂow anoma-
lies (Facsk´o et al. 2009) embedded in the highly turbu-
lent MS. Some of these nonlinear structures are also asso-
ciated with enhanced levels of wave and ﬂuctuation activ-
ity (Kov´acs et al. 2009). The ﬂuctuations and structures
are more pronounced in the quasi-parallel BS conﬁgura-
tion when the angle between the interplanetary magnetic
ﬁeld (IMF) and the nominal BS normal is smaller than
45◦. In such a case, the upstream (solar wind, foreshock)
and downstream MS regions are magnetically connected
and the resulting turbulence becomes increasingly inter-
mittent away from the BS (Yordanova et al. 2008).

In turbulent space plasmas thin magnetic structures,
current sheets and reconnection can be generated sponta-
neously through complex interactions (Chang et al. 2004;
Servidio et al. 2009; Matthaeus et al. 2015). Further-

more, recent studies on the statistics of velocity gra-
dient tensor invariants revealed that approaching the
non-MHD scales vortex stretching may play a rele-
vant role in generating small scale dissipative structures
(Consolini et al. 2015). These structures observed as dis-
continuities in the solar wind (Greco et al. 2009) are asso-
ciated with local dissipation/heating (Osman et al. 2012,
2014) and introduce intermittency to plasma turbulence.
The occurrence frequency of discontinuities in the so-
lar wind agrees rather well with the statistics of turbu-
lence generated current sheets in numerical simulations
(Greco et al. 2008, 2009; Servidio et al. 2011). Cluster
observations in MS downstream quasi-parallel BS also
conﬁrmed the occurrence of reconnecting thin current
sheets (R´etino et al. 2007; Sundkvist et al. 2007) and the
current sheet associated electron heating (Chasapis et al.
2015a).

Numerical simulations have shown that the strongest
discontinuities and current sheets generated by turbu-
lence populate the tails of non-Gaussian PDFs of normal-
ized current density (Greco et al. 2009; Matthaeus et al.
2015). However, this has not been shown directly from
the data. Although it is tempting to assume that the fat
tails of the PDFs are completely determined by turbu-
lence generated strong current sheets, one should not for-
get that there might exist other intermittent structures
of diﬀerent origin. As a matter of fact, the high Reynolds
number simulations of MHD turbulence (Greco et al.
2009; Servidio et al. 2011) cannot reproduce the rich en-
semble of intermittent nonlinear structures mentioned
above. In this letter, using Cluster data in the MS down-
stream of quasi-parallel BS, we show that the strongest
observed current sheets de facto occupy the tails of his-
tograms. We also estimate the occurrence frequency of
the strongest current sheets along the trajectory of Clus-
ter spacecraft. The paper is organized as follows: Section
2 explains the data and instrumentation, Section 3 in-
troduces the structure detection tools. Section 4 demon-
strates how the structure detection tools work for a thin
current sheet.
In Section 5 discontinuity and current
sheet statistics is presented. Section 6 contains the sum-

2. DATA AND INSTRUMENTATION

In this Letter we consider the data interval between
9.6 and 10.6 UT (decimal hours) on 27 March 2002
when the Cluster spacecraft probed the magnetosheath
downstream of a quasi-parallel bow shock. OMNI
1−minute data have been used to obtain the model
bow shock (Farris and Russell 1994) and magnetopause
(Shue et al. 1998) boundaries as well as the normal vec-
tor to the bow shock. The Cluster ﬂeet was initially at
the GSE coordinate system position (10, −8.2, −8) RE,
moving ∼ 1RE towards the magnetopause in a nearly
perfect tetrahedron conﬁguration with inter-probe sep-
arations of about 100 km. The relative positions of
the spacecraft are shown in Figure 1. The upstream
plasma and ﬁeld conditions in the solar wind were quasi-
stationary with average parameters - magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 3.4
nT, velocity ∼ 446 km/s, and density ∼ 3 cm−1.

During the selected interval,

the magnetic ﬁeld
measurements were available from the FGM instru-
ment
(Balogh et al. 1997) with sampling frequency
fs = 67 Hz, and from the STAFF instrument
(Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al. 1997) with fs = 450 Hz. By
using ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlter at ∼ 1 Hz the mag-
netic data from both instruments were merged into one
time-series with extended frequency coverage up to 450
Hz in burst mode. The electric ﬁeld data were available
from EFW instrument (Gustafsson et al. 1997).

3. STRUCTURE DETECTION TOOLS

Current sheets, associated with large-scale boundaries,
such as the magnetopause or the magnetotail current
sheet can be easily identiﬁed. Even if the boundaries
are moving or the structures are ﬂapping, the same cur-
rent sheet can be observed multiple times. On the other
hand, turbulence generated boundaries and the associ-
ated current sheets are small-scale and transient in the
spacecraft frame. Their identiﬁcation requires special
methods. To detect discontinuities and current sheets
in magnetosheath three types of parameters will be es-
timated from Cluster spacecraft pairs (Ci − Cj, i, j= 1,
2, 3, 4) in time t: 1.) the Partial Variance of Increments
(P V Iij (t)); 2.) the angle between magnetic ﬁeld vectors
θij(t); and 3.) the magnetic ﬁeld derivatives ∂ij (t).

The method using PVIs was ﬁrst introduced for iden-
tiﬁcation of discontinuities within the intermittent solar
wind turbulence from single point measurement. The re-
sults have also been supported by numerical simulations
(Greco et al. 2009). The PVIs here are calculated on the
basis of the normalized variance of the absolute value of
magnetic ﬁeld spatial increments between two spacecraft
∆B ij (t) = B i(t) − B j(t):

P V Iij (t) =s | ∆B ij (t) |2
(cid:10)| ∆B ij |2(cid:11)

,

(1)

where the average h·i is taken over the whole interval.

The mean P V Im(t) = Pij P V Iij (t)/6 is also calcu-

lated. In contrary to the standard one-directional P V I
(Greco et al. 2008), P V Im comprises information on in-
crements along all Ci − Cj pairs in Cluster tetrahedron.
In recent 3D simulations of MHD turbulence a similar

multi-directional PVI was used, arguably providing an
unbiased information about the spatial structure of dis-
continuities (Zhang et al. 2015).

The rotation of the magnetic ﬁeld vector between

spacecraft pairs is estimated through:

θij (t) = cos−1 B i(t) · B j(t)

| B i(t) | · | B j(t) |

.

(2)

The partial derivatives of the magnetic ﬁeld are ob-

tained from:

∂ij(t) ≡

∆B ij(t)
∆r ij (t)

(3)

where ∆r ij(t) is the spatial separation between Ci, Cj
pairs, ∂ij stands for the partial derivatives ∂BX/∂X,
∂BX/∂Y , ∂BX /∂Z, etc. These form the orthogonal
components of (∇ × B)xyz and (∇ · B)xyz. For sup-
posedly time-independent short events with roughly con-
stant (∇×B)xyz and for linearly changing magnitudes of
magnetic components over the tetrahedron, the current
density j = (∇ × B)/µ0 (µ0 is the magnetic constant)
can be calculated.

It has already been shown that the parameters P V I
and θ are correlated. Discontinuities with high values
of P V I are associated with large magnetic rotations
θ > 90◦ (Chasapis et al. 2015a). The joint occurrence
of strong magnetic shear and high P V I indicates that
the corresponding discontinuity is a current sheet. More
about structure detection tools in turbulence can be
found in Chasapis et al. (2015b). For the studied interval
the correlations are demonstrated in Figure 2. The left
panels 2a.–2d. show the magnetic ﬁeld intensity for C1,
the PVI magnitude for the spacecraft pair C1–C4, the
magnetic ﬁeld rotation angle for the same pair of probes
and the partial derivatives for the BZ components of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The parameters from other spacecrafts
or spacecraft pairs look similar (not shown). The right
panels 2e.–2h. show the PDFs corresponding to the time
series on the left. The maxima of PDFs are normal-
ized to one. Gaussians with the same standard devia-
tions are inserted as well. Although the PDF of B(C1) is
the closest to the Gaussian distribution, there are signiﬁ-
cant deviations from it near the peak value. It indicates,
that various physical processes with diﬀerent magnetic
PDFs can form the summary histogram within the ana-
lyzed interval. The large deviations from the Gaussians
for the other parameters are evident near the maxima
and at the tails of PDFs. Since the strongest discon-
tinuities or (reconnecting) current sheets are expected
to form the tail of PDFs (Greco et al. 2009), we are in-
terested in correlations between the extremal values of
P V Iij , θij and ∂ij. The green boxes in panels 2a.–2d.
show a few sub-intervals of the data when the threshold
P V I(C1 − C4) = 4 selects intervals of large-deviations
of θij and ∂ij as well.

4. AN EXAMPLE OF CURRENT SHEET

Figure 3 shows a crossing of thin proton-scale (∼0.5
sec) current sheet by the Cluster ﬂeet,
for which
Chasapis et al. (2015a) found electron heating signa-
tures. For this event the GSE coordinate system was
shown to be very close to the current sheet system.
The panels show the bipolar change of the electric ﬁeld

STRUCTURES IN THE MAGNETOSHEATH

EX (C2) (3a.), the BZ(C1, C2, C3, C4) components of
the magnetic ﬁeld (3b.), P V Is for spacecraft pairs and
the mean P V Im (3c.), θs for spacecraft pairs (3d.) and
the derivatives ∂ij (3e.–3g.). The bipolar EX (C2) sig-
nature is associated with the fast, ∼0.06 sec long sign-
change of BZ(C2) within the dashed box. The aver-
age Doppler-shifted electron gyroperiod for the consid-
ered 1 h long interval is ∼ 0.04 sec, rather close to the
duration of the bipolar electric ﬁeld change. This thin
electron current sheet is embedded into a broader sheet
associated with the more gradual changes of BZ before
and after of the dashed box. The fastest sign-changes
of BZ in Figure 3b were observed by C1 and C2 indi-
cating that these probes crossed the current sheet where
it was locally thinner or in a direction more perpendic-
ular than the other probes. Since the C1 − C2 probes
are separated mainly in Y and Z directions (Figure 1),
the current sheet normal direction is close to the GSE X
direction. This is also conﬁrmed by minimum variance
analysis (not shown). Therefore, the normal component
of the electric ﬁeld is En ∼ EX (Figure 3a.) exhibiting
the same time scale as the embedded electron scale seen
in BZ (red curve in the dashed box, Figure 3b.). Fig-
ures 3c. and d. show that the P V Iij or P V Im and θij
parameters are correlated and indicate the crossings of
the thin current sheet rather well. θij ∼ 180◦ implies
that the current sheet is between a spacecraft pair while
θij ∼ 0◦ indicates that the probes are at the same side
of the sheet. The derivatives of the BZ component mark
the presence of the current sheet (Figure 3g.), the other
∂ijs show only insigniﬁcant ﬂuctuations (Figures 3e., f.).
Some events during the analyzed interval are associated
with the sign-changes and enhanced gradients of the BY
component.

5. CURRENT SHEET AND DISCONTINUITY STATISTICS

The potential discontinuities in the data can be found
by using the mean P V Im.
In any case, however, the
PVI thresholds should not be considered as unique pa-
rameters identifying the thin current sheets. For the se-
lected cases here we considered all the parameters shown
in Figure 3 and visually checked the events. The use-
fulness of P V Im is demonstrated in Figure 4g., where
three diﬀerent thresholds (red, blue and black horizon-
tal lines) and the corresponding time instants - points
- are shown. The red, blue and black populations of
points correspond to the P V Im thresholds of the same
color. The ﬁrst ﬁve discontinuities are numbered and
color coded by red, magenta, blue, green and brown.
This color code is also used in Figure 5 for indicating
the location of discontinuities in a histogram. The 1st
discontinuity (magnetic components are depicted in Fig-
ures 4d.–f.) is a magnetic reconnection event described
thoroughly by (R´etino et al. 2007). The 2nd disconti-
nuity is a current sheet with BY sign-changes and the
3rd discontinuity is a more complicated event compris-
ing crossings of two neighboring current sheets. The 4st
discontinuity (Figures 4a.–c.) was identiﬁed as a current
sheet associated with electron heating by Chasapis et al.
(2015a). For these current sheets the maxima of θij are
close to 180◦. The 5th discontinuity is a current sheet
where the maxima of θij are less than 120◦, which is still
a very high magnetic shear angle (Chasapis et al. 2015a).
Figure 4h. shows the largest thickness of discontinuities

in seconds for changing thresholds P V Im. It is calcu-
lated as a local duration of a discontinuity in time having
P V Im ≥ threshold. Since for a given threshold a discon-
tinuity may be represented by one P V Im ≥ threshold
value only, the smallest thicknesses are often close to
0 second. Therefore, the mean discontinuity thickness
has no meaning. However, the largest thickness (Figure
4h.) together with the total number of detected discon-
tinuities (Figure 4i.) for a given P V Im threshold pro-
vides the information about the minimum number of dis-
continuities with thicknesses equal or smaller than the
largest thickness. The comparison of Figure 4h. with
Figure 4i. shows, that for very thin structures, for ex-
ample with a duration of less than one second (pos-
sibly current sheets), there exist almost one hundred
discontinuities during the analyzed magnetosheath in-
terval. Nevertheless, Figure 4g. demonstrates that the
strongest discontinuities represent a tiny part of the
time series only.
In order to show that the intermit-
tently occurring rare current sheets belong to the tails
of PDFs as it is expected from 2D MHD simulations
of current density distributions (Greco et al. 2009) the
PDF(j ) should be obtained directly from the data. Al-
though non-Gaussian skewed distributions are typical
for space plasmas (Burlaga and Ness 1998; V¨or¨os et al.
2015), the direct estimation of j from in-situ data is dif-
ﬁcult. The curlometer technique provides an estimate
of (∇ × B), but it is loaded by several known sources
of errors (Vallat et al. 2005). The curlometer works sat-
isfactorily for well selected, short and stationary events
with a linear variation of B inside the tetrahedron. This
is not the case for the entire one-hour long interval an-
alyzed here. To reconstruct the whole PDF(j ), the lo-
calized strong currents (PDF tail), the nearly current-
free ﬂux tube regions and the random transient currents
(central part of PDF) should all be involved in a his-
togram. However, the quality of the current density es-
timation for the considered time interval is low. This
can be deduced from the ratio divB/|∇ × B|, which has
values ≫ 1 for large parts of the data. For good quality
(j ) estimations it should be ≪ 1 (Grimald et al. 2012).
This is why instead of the derived quantity (∇ × B),
which can also be burdened with additional errors, we
use the partial derivatives ∂ij for further statistical in-
vestigations. However, as Figures 3e.–g. show, some of
the ∂ij s are close to zero even during current sheet cross-
ing. On the other hand, there exist nonzero ∂ij values
which are not associated with the current sheet. The
simplest way to obtain PDF(∂ij ) is to take the extreme
value of ∂ij (extr, t) = max(∂ij (t)) or = min(∂ij(t)) at
times t. Physically, we select structures which are asso-
ciated with the largest magnetic gradient between space-
craft pairs in the tetrahedron volume at times t. The
result is shown in Figure 5. The black points correspond
to the histogram of the entire time series of ∂ij(extr, t).
The left (negative values) and the right (positive values)
of PDF(∂ij (extr)) are obtained independently. Since the
extreme value distribution has very low occurrence fre-
quencies for small values of derivatives, the central noisy
part of the histogram for −0.05 < ∂ij(extr) < 0.05
[nT/km] is cut oﬀ. The color coded points on the PDF
curve, according to their ∂ij (extr), correspond to the ﬁve
current sheets for diﬀerent thresholds P V Im shown in
Figure 4g.. We note, that the boxes in histograms near a

4

V¨or¨os et al.

given value of ∂ij (extr) contain contributions from many
other time intervals. Nevertheless, for the purposes of
this study, it was enough to show that the strong dis-
continuities belong to the histogram boxes at the tails
of PDFs. The green curves in Figure 5 correspond to
Gaussian distributions. The smallest values are normally
distributed, while at the non-Gaussian tail the strongest
discontinuities are observed as it is expected from numer-
ical simulations (Greco et al. 2009; Servidio et al. 2009;
Matthaeus et al. 2015). The wider Gaussian in Figure 5
has the same mean and standard deviation as the data.
The narrower Gaussian represents a ﬁt to the central
part of the histogram, shown with the purpose to indi-
cate the strong deviation of the tails from the normal
PDF. The PDF values between the two Gaussian curves
are expected to correspond to magnetic structures, pos-
sibly ﬂux tubes (Greco et al. 2009).

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The main aim of this study was to show that the
thin current sheets identiﬁed by simple structure de-
tection tools populate the fat tails of PDFs. This
has already been shown for the histograms of the nor-
malized current density in MHD turbulence simulations
(Greco et al. 2009; Matthaeus et al. 2015). However, in
simulations the identiﬁcation of current and magnetic
structures forming the non-Gaussian PDF(j ) is straight-
forward. Although the four-point curlometer technique is
an excellent tool for estimating j (t) from four-spacecraft
data, it works well for selected short events only. The
two-point magnetic ﬁeld diﬀerences have already been
used previously in turbulence studies to obtain the long
tail PDFs (V¨or¨os et al. 2006) and to identify the in-
termittency eﬀects (Yordanova et al. 2015). The ex-
tremal values of magnetic ﬁeld partial derivatives cal-
culated between spacecraft pairs are also associated with
thin current sheets. We found that the strongest cur-
rent sheets associated with ∂ij(extr) belong to the tails
of PDF(∂ij (extr)), conﬁrming the results of MHD tur-
bulence simulations on the generation of intermittent
structures (Greco et al. 2009; Matthaeus et al. 2015). It
was also found that during a one-hour-long time Cluster
observed about a hundred thin magnetic structures in
the MS downstream of a quasi-parallel BS which might
be associated with non-homogenous localized heating of
plasma. This conjecture has to be conﬁrmed by a thor-
ough analysis of similar events using high resolution ﬁeld,
particle and plasma data from the MMS mission. Our
results also demonstrate that, a conditional selection of
structures and their identiﬁcation in histograms (PDFs)
represents a powerful tool for better understanding of the
role of rare but intense events (in our case strong discon-
tinuities or reconnection sites), which can determine the
basic physical properties of plasma systems.
