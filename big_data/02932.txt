CRITICAL METRICS OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL ON

MANIFOLDS WITH BOUNDARY

H. BALTAZAR & E. RIBEIRO JR

Abstract. The goal of this article is to study the space of smooth Riemann-
ian structures on compact manifolds with boundary that satisﬁes a critical
point equation associated with a boundary value problem. We provide an in-
tegral formula which enables us to show that if a critical metric of the volume
functional on a connected n-dimensional manifold M n with boundary ∂M
has parallel Ricci tensor, then M n is isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply
connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn.

1. Introduction

An outstanding problem in diﬀerential geometry is to ﬁnd Riemannian metrics
on a given manifold M n that provides constant curvature. In this sense, it is crucial
to understand the critical metrics of the Riemannian functionals, as for instance, the
total scalar curvature functional and the volume functional. Einstein and Hilbert
have proven that the critical points of the total scalar curvature functional restricted
to the set of smooth Riemannian structures on M n of unitary volume are Einstein
(cf. Theorem 4.21 in [3]). Moreover, the total scalar curvature functional restricted
to a given conformal class is just the Yamabe functional, whose critical points
are constant scalar curvature metrics in that class. Hilbert [11] proved that the
equations of general relativity can be recovered from the total scalar curvature
functional. From this, we have a natural way to prove the existence of Einstein
metrics.

Inspired by a result obtained in [10] as well as in the characterization of the
critical points of the total scalar curvature functional, Miao and Tam (cf.
[14]
and [15]) studied variational properties of the volume functional constrained to the
space of metrics of constant scalar curvature on a given compact manifold with
boundary. While Corvino, Eichmair and Miao [6] studied the modiﬁed problem of
ﬁnding stationary points for the volume functional on the space of metrics whose
scalar curvature is equal to a given constant.

Following the terminology used in [2] we recall the deﬁnition of Miao-tam critical

metrics.

Deﬁnition 1. A Miao-Tam critical metric is a 3-tuple (M n, g, f ), where (M n, g)
is a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension at least three with a smooth bound-
ary ∂M and f : M n → R is a smooth function such that f −1(0) = ∂M satisfying

L∗

g(f ) = g.

Here, L∗
ator Lg. Such a function f is called a potential function.

g is the formal L2-adjoint of the linearization of the scalar curvature oper-

We also recall that

L∗

g(f ) = −(∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric,

where Ric, ∆ and Hess stand, respectively, for the Ricci tensor, the Laplacian oper-
ator and the Hessian form on M n; see for instance [3]. Therefore, the fundamental
equation of Miao-Tam critical metrics (1.1) can be rewritten as

(1.2)

− (∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric = g.

In [14], it was remarked that Miao-Tam critical metrics arise as critical points
of the volume functional on M n when restricted to the class of metrics g with pre-
scribed constant scalar curvature such that g|T ∂M = h for a prescribed Riemannian
metric h on the boundary. In addition, they showed that such metrics have constant
scalar curvature R. For more background see e.g. Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 2.3
in [6]. Some explicit examples of Miao-Tam critical metrics can be found in [14, 15].
They include the spatial Schwarzschild metrics and AdS-Schwarzschild metrics re-
stricted to certain domains containing their horizon and bounded by two spherically
symmetric spheres. We also remember that the standard metrics on geodesic balls
in space forms are Miao-Tam critical metrics. For more details see Theorem 6 in
[14].

Miao and Tam [15] posed the question of whether there exist non-constant sec-
tional curvature Miao-Tam critical metrics on a compact manifold whose boundary
is isometric to a standard round sphere. In this sense, inspired by ideas outlined by
Kobayashi [12], Kobayashi and Obata [13], they proved that a locally conformally
ﬂat simply connected, compact Miao-Tam critical metric (M n, g, f ) with boundary
isometric to a standard sphere Sn−1 must be isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply
connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn.

In order to proceed, we recall three special tensors in the study of curvature for
a Riemannian manifold (M n, g), n ≥ 3. The ﬁrst one is the Weyl tensor W which
is deﬁned by the following decomposition formula

Rijkl = Wijkl +

n − 2(cid:0)Rikgjl + Rjlgik − Rilgjk − Rjkgil(cid:1)

R

(1.3)

−

(n − 1)(n − 2)(cid:0)gjlgik − gilgjk(cid:1),

where Rijkl stands for the Riemann curvature tensor, whereas the second one is
the Cotton tensor C given by

(1.4)

Cijk = ∇iRjk − ∇jRik −

1

2(n − 1)(cid:0)∇iRgjk − ∇jRgik).

Note that Cijk is skew-symmetric in the ﬁrst two indices and trace-free in any two
indices. These two above tensors are related as follows

(1.5)

Cijk = −

provided n ≥ 4. We also recall that the Bach tensor [1] on a Riemannian manifold
(M n, g), n ≥ 4, is deﬁned in term of the components of the Weyl tensor Wikjl as

while for n = 3 it is given by

(1.7)
We say that (M n, g) is Bach-ﬂat when Bij = 0. It is easy to check that locally
conformally ﬂat metrics as well as Einstein metrics are Bach-ﬂat.

Bij = ∇kCkij .

Recently, Barros, Di´ogenes and Ribeiro [2], based on the techniques outlined in
a work of Cao and Chen [4], proved that a Bach-ﬂat simply connected, compact
Miao-Tam critical metric with boundary isometric to a standard sphere S3 must be
isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form R4, H4 or S4. Further,
they showed that in dimension three the result even is true replacing the Bach-ﬂat
condition by the weaker assumption that M 3 has divergence-free Bach tensor. For
more details, we refer the reader to [2].

At the same time, Miao and Tam [15] studied these critical metrics under Ein-
stein condition. In that case, they were able to remove the condition of boundary
isometric to a standard sphere. More precisely, they obtained the following result.

Theorem 1 (Miao-Tam, [15]). Let (M n, g, f ) be a connected, compact Einstein
Miao-Tam critical metric with smooth boundary ∂M. Then (M n, g) is isometric to
a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn.

For what follows, we point out that every Riemannian manifold with parallel
Ricci tensor has harmonic curvature. But, the converse statement is not true, see
[8] and [9] for more details. Indeed, there are examples of compact and noncompact
Riemannian manifolds with harmonic curvature but non-parallel Ricci tensor. Here,
motivated by the historical development on the study of critical metrics of the
volume functional, we shall replace the assumption of Einstein in the Miao-Tam
result (cf. Theorem 1) by the parallel Ricci tensor condition, which is weaker that
the former. In order to do so, we have established the following result.

Theorem 2. Let (M n, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical
metric with smooth boundary ∂M. Then we have:

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg +

n

n − 1 ZM

|Ric−

R
n

g|2dMg +ZM

f (∆|Ric|2 −|∇Ric|2)dMg = 0.

In the sequel, as an application of Theorem 2 we get the following rigidity result.

Corollary 1. Let (M n, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam criti-
cal metric with parallel Ricci tensor and smooth boundary ∂M. Then (M n, g) is
isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn, or Sn.

It is easy to check that Einstein manifolds M n, n ≥ 3, have parallel Ricci tensor.
Therefore, Corollary 1 clearly improves Theorem 1. Moreover, it is worth pointing
out that our arguments designed for the proof of Theorem 2 diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
[15].

Let us also highlight that every Einstein manifold has harmonic Weyl tensor (cf.
[8]). Furthermore, we already know that there is no relationship between Bach-ﬂat
condition, considered in [2], and the condition that M n has harmonic Weyl tensor.

4

H. BALTAZAR & E. RIBEIRO JR

Therefore, it is natural to ask which geometric implications has the assumption of
the harmonicity of the Weyl tensor on a Miao-Tam critical metric. By using once
more Theorem 2 jointly with Theorem 1, it is straightforward to check that if a
compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical metric with harmonic Weyl tensor
and smooth boundary satisﬁes

(1.8)

ZM

f ∆|Ric|2dMg ≥ ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg,

then (M n, g) is isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn,
Hn or Sn. Nonetheless, it is very interesting to prove that condition (1.8) can be
removed.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we shall present some preliminaries which will be useful for the es-
tablishment of the desired results. Firstly, we recall that the fundamental equation
of a Miao-Tam critical metric (1.1) becomes

(2.1)

− (∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric = g.

In particular, tracing (2.1) we have

(2.2)

(n − 1)∆f + Rf = −n.

For sake of simplicity, we now rewrite equation (2.1) in the tensorial language as
follows

(2.3)

− (∆f )gij + ∇i∇jf − f Rij = gij.

Moreover, by using (2.2) it is not diﬃcult to check that

(2.4)
where ˚T stands for the traceless of T.

f ˚Ric = ˚Hessf ,

For our purpose we also remember that as consequence of Bianchi identity we

have

(2.5)

(divRm)jkl = ∇kRjl − ∇lRjk.

Under these notations we get the following lemma obtained previously in [2].

Lemma 1 ([2]). Let (M n, g, f ) be a Miao-Tam critial metric. Then we have:

f (∇iRjk − ∇jRik) = Rijkl∇lf +

R

n − 1

(∇if gjk − ∇jf gik) − (∇if Rjk − ∇j f Rik).

Proof. Since the proof of this lemma is very short, we include it here for the sake
of completeness. Firstly, we use (2.3) to infer

(2.6)

(∇if )Rjk + f ∇iRjk = ∇i∇j∇kf − (∇i∆f )gjk.

Next, since M n has constant scalar curvature we have from (2.2) that

which substituted into (2.6) gives

∇i∆f = −

Finally, it suﬃces to apply the Ricci identity to arrive at

f (∇iRjk − ∇j Rik) = Rijkl∇lf +

as we wanted to prove.

(∇if gjk − ∇j f gik) − (∇if Rjk − ∇jf Rik),

(cid:3)

To conclude this section we recall that, from commutation formulas (Ricci iden-

tities), for any Riemannian manifold M n we have

(2.8)

∇i∇jRik − ∇j∇iRik = RijisRsk + RijksRis,

for more details see [7].

3. Proof of the Main Result

In this section we shall prove Theorem 2 announced in Section 1. First of all,

we shall present a fundamental integral formula.

Lemma 2. Let (M n, g, f ) be a Miao-Tam critial metric. Then we have:

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM
+2ZM
+2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg +ZM

h∇f, ∇|Ric|2idMg

f (Rij RikRjk − RijklRjlRik)dMg

Cklj ∇lf RjkdMg.

Proof. Firstly, we use (2.5) to infer

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = ZM
= ZM

which can be rewritten as

f (divRm)jkl(divRm)jkldMg

f (∇kRlj − ∇lRkj )(∇kRlj − ∇lRkj )dMg,

(3.1)

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg − 2ZM

f ∇kRlj ∇lRkj dMg.

Next, notice that

ZM

f ∇kRlj ∇lRkj dMg = −ZM
+ZM

∇lf ∇kRljRkj dMg −ZM

∇l(f ∇kRljRkj )dMg.

Hence we use this data in (3.1) to deduce

f ∇l∇kRlj RkjdMg

ZM

(3.2)

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM
+2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg + 2ZM
f ∇l∇kRljRkj dMg − 2ZM

∇lf ∇kRlj Rkj dMg

∇l(f ∇kRlj Rkj)dMg.

6

H. BALTAZAR & E. RIBEIRO JR

Since M n has constant scalar curvature we may use (1.4) to infer

which substituted jointly with (2.8) into (3.2) gives

Cklj = ∇kRlj − ∇lRkj ,

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM
+2ZM
−2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg + 2ZM

∇lf (∇lRkj + Cklj )Rkj dMg

f (∇k∇lRlj + RlklsRsj + RlkjsRls)Rkj dMg

∇l(f ∇kRljRkj )dMg.

Now, since f vanishes on the boundary, we apply Stokes’s formula and the twice

contracted second Bianchi identity to arrive at

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM
+2ZM
+2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg +ZM

h∇f, ∇|Ric|2idMg

∇lf Cklj Rkj dMg

f (RksRsj Rkj − RkljsRlsRkj )dMg.

Finally, it suﬃces to change the indices of the last integral of the right hand side

to obtain

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = 2ZM
+2ZM
+2ZM

f |∇Ric|2dMg +ZM

h∇f, ∇|Ric|2idMg

Cklj ∇lf RjkdMg

f (Rij RikRjk − RijklRjlRik)dMg.

So, the proof is completed.

(cid:3)

Before presenting the proof of Theorem 2, we provide another expression for

RM f |divRm|2dMg. More precisely, we have established the following lemma.

Lemma 3. Let (M n, g, f ) be a Miao-Tam critial metric. Then we have:

ZM

f |divRm|2dMg = −ZM
−2ZM
+2ZM

h∇f, ∇|Ric|2idMg − 2ZM

Cklj ∇lf RjkdMg

f (Rij RikRjk − RijklRjlRik)dMg

∇i(∇j RikRjk)dMg − 2ZM

∇i(RijklRjl∇kf )dMg.

Proof. To begin with, from (2.3) we achieve

ZM

f RijklRjlRikdMg = ZM
= −ZM

From here it follows that

ZM

f RijklRjlRikdMg = −ZM
−ZM

By using (2.5) we have

RijklRjl(−(∆f + 1)gik + ∇i∇kf )dMg

(∆f + 1)|Ric|2dMg +ZM

RijklRjl∇i∇kf dMg.

f RijklRjlRikdMg = −ZM

On the other hand, it is not diﬃcult to check that

Cklj Rjl∇kf dMg

∇i(RijklRjl∇kf )dMg.

Rijkl∇iRjl∇kf dMgi
Rjikl∇jRil∇kf dMgi
Rijkl∇jRil∇kf dMgi

Then, we change the indices k by l in the right hand side to infer

ZM

Rijkl∇iRjl∇kf dMg = −

This data substituted in (3.3) yields

Next, it follows from Lemma 1 that

−

R

n − 1

(∇if gjk − ∇jf gik)(∇iRjk − ∇jRik).

Then, since M n has constant scalar curvature we can use the twice contracted
second Bianchi identity to obtain

8

H. BALTAZAR & E. RIBEIRO JR

Rijkl∇lf (∇iRjk − ∇jRik) = f |∇iRjk − ∇jRik|2

+(∇iRjk − ∇jRik)(∇if Rjk − ∇jf Rik).

From this it follows that

Rijkl∇lf (∇iRjk − ∇jRik) = f |divRm|2 + h∇f, ∇|Ric|2i − ∇jf Rik∇iRjk

−∇if Rjk∇jRik

(3.5)

= f |divRm|2 + h∇f, ∇|Ric|2i − 2∇if Rjk∇jRik.

By using once more the twice contracted second Bianchi identity we immediately
have

∇i(∇jf RikRjk) = ∇i∇jf RikRjk + ∇if Rjk∇jRik.

This combined with (3.5) yields

Rijkl∇lf (∇iRjk − ∇jRik) = f |divRm|2 + h∇f, ∇|Ric|2i + 2∇i∇j f RikRjk

−2∇i(∇j f RikRjk)

= f |divRm|2 + h∇f, ∇|Ric|2i + 2(f Rij + (∆f + 1)gij)RikRjk

−2∇i(∇j f RikRjk).

From which follows that

Rijkl∇lf (∇iRjk − ∇jRik) = f |divRm|2 + h∇f, ∇|Ric|2i + 2f RijRikRjk

+2(∆f + 1)|Ric|2 − 2∇i(∇j f RikRjk).

Whence, on integrating this last expression over M n and then substituting into

(3.4) we arrive at

ZM

f RijklRjlRikdMg = −ZM

∇i(RijklRjl∇kf )dMg.

This gives the requested result.

(cid:3)

We are now in the position to prove Theorem 2.

Proof. We already know that every Riemannian manifold with parallel Ricci tensor
has harmonic curvature (cf. Equation (2.5)). Moreover, from Kato’s inequality we
have

|∇|Ric|| ≤ |∇Ric|.

on M n. Now, it suﬃces to invoke Theorem 2 to deduce

and this forces M n to be Einstein. Then, we are in position to use Theorem 1 (see
also Theorem 1.1 of [15]) to conclude that (M n, g) is isometric to a geodesic ball
in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn. So, the proof is completed.
