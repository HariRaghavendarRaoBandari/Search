(Dated: March 18, 2016)

We develop the concept of scattering matrix and we use it to perform stable numerical calculations
of photo-emission from nano-tips. Electrons move in an external space and time dependent nonper-
turbative electric ﬁeld. We apply our algorithm for diﬀerent strengths and spatial conﬁgurations of
the ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The aim of this paper is to investigate some par-
ticular quantum processes taking place in an arbitrary
space-dependent scalar potential and a time- and space-
dependent vector potential. Vector potential is periodic
in time and describes a laser ﬁeld. Its space-dependence
results from the interaction of the laser ﬁeld with elec-
trons in solids. Such conditions are met for example in
semiconductor nanostructures [1–3] (like quantum wires
or wells), photoemission from a metal tip [4, 5], carbon
nanotubes or graphene [6–8] or in surface physics [9–15].
To make our presentation as clear as possible we shall
restrict ourselves to the one-space-dimensional case, al-
though extension of the presented method to systems of
higher dimensionality is possible (see, e.g. [16]). We shall
apply our method to investigation of the photo-emission
process.

In Sec.

This paper is organized as follows.

II the
most general solution of the Schr¨odinger equation is in-
troduced. The transfer-matrix method and matching
III, whereas reﬂection
conditions are analyzed in Sec.
and transition probabilities are introduced in Sec.
IV.
These probabilities must sum up to 1, which puts a very
strong check for the accuracy of numerical calculations.
The most important part of this paper, i.e. the concept
of the scattering-matrix method, is discussed in the next
section, where it is shown why the scattering-matrix al-
gorithm has to be introduced, instead of a much simpler
transfer-matrix algorithm. Numerical illustrations of the
applicability of this algorithm are presented in Sec. VI,
and are followed by short conclusions.

In our numerical illustrations we use atomic units, if

otherwise stated.

II. SOLUTION OF THE SCHR ¨ODINGER

EQUATION

Let us start with one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equa-

tion of the form [17],

i∂tψ(x, t) =h 1
2(cid:16) 1

i

∂x − eA(x, t)(cid:17) 1

m(x)(cid:16) 1

i

+V (x)iψ(x, t).

∂x − eA(x, t)(cid:17)

(1)

Space-dependent mass m(x), scalar potential V (x) and
vector potential A(x, t) are spatially constant in ﬁnite
intervals. Their values in any interval (xi−1, xi) will be
denoted as mi, Vi and Ai(t). We require also that the
function A(x, t) is periodic in time, that is

A(x, t + T ) = A(x, t),

(2)

where T = 2π/ω and ω is the frequency of the oscillating
in time electric ﬁeld. Deﬁning in a standard way the
probability density ρ(x, t),

ρ(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|2,

(3)

and the probability current j(x, t),

j(x, t) =

we show using Eq. (1) that the conservation of proba-
bility condition is satisﬁed. Indeed, assuming the above
deﬁnitions, we get the continuity equation,

∂tρ(x, t) + ∂xj(x, t) = 0.

(5)

Space dependence of mass in Eq. (1) forces one to im-
pose non-standard continuity conditions on any solution
of this equation. It is now the wavefunction ψ(x, t) and
the quantity

m(x)(cid:16) 1

i

∂x − eA(x, t)(cid:17)ψ(x, t)

(6)

that have to be continuous at points of discontinuity of
mass m(x) and both potentials V (x) and A(x, t) [17–20].
Before passing to a general solution ψ(x, t) of Eq. (1)
in any given interval (xi−1, xi), which we shall denote as
ψi(x, t), let us note that due to time periodicity of the
Hamiltonian, ψi(x, t) can be chosen such that the Floquet
condition,

ψi(x, t + T ) = e−iET ψi(x, t),

(7)

is satisﬁed, where E is the so-called quasienergy. A gen-
eral solution ψi(x, t) of Eq. (1) in any interval (xi−1, xi)

takes then the following form [22, 23],

ψi(x, t) =

×

∞

XM =−∞
XN =−∞

∞

exp(cid:0)−i(E + M ω)t(cid:1) Xσ=±
Cσ

(8)

where Cσ
mined and

iN are arbitrary complex numbers to be deter-

piN = p2mi(E + N ω − Vi − Ui),

(9)
with Ui = e2hA2
i (t)i/2mi being the ponderomotive en-
i (t)i means the time-average of A2
ergy, where hA2
i (t) over
the laser-ﬁeld oscillation. Components for which piN are
purely imaginary are called closed channels. These chan-
nels are not observed for a particle in initial or ﬁnal
states, but they have to be taken into account in order to
satisfy the unitary condition of the time evolution. In a
general case, the BM −N (σpiN ) functions are components
of the following Fourier expansion,

∞

exp(cid:0)iΦσ

iN (t)(cid:1) =

XM =−∞

exp (−iM ωt)BM −N (σpiN ) (10)

provided that the vector potential A(x, t) is periodic in
time. Functions Φσ

iN (t) are deﬁned as follows:

(11)
It is easily seen from the above equation that the
BM −N (σpiN ) functions depend on the form of the vector
potential A(x, t), that is on the laser ﬁeld applied.

III. MATCHING CONDITIONS AND

TRANSFER MATRIX

Continuity conditions discussed above and applied to a
general solution (8) of the Schr¨odinger equation (1) lead
to an inﬁnite chain of equations connecting constants Cσ
iN
in the neighboring domains. These matching conditions
can be written in the matrix form,

B(i − 1, xi−1)Ci−1 = B(i, xi−1)Ci,

(12)

iN = [C ±

where C ±
C ±

i ]N are the components of the columns
i . The matrices B(i, x) and Ci are deﬁned as follows,

B(i, x) = (cid:18) B+(i, x) B−(i, x)

B′+(i, x) B′−(i, x) (cid:19) , Ci = (cid:18) C +

i
C −

i (cid:19) .

(13)
The elements of B(i, x) can be computed in the following
way.

For an arbitrary function A(x, t), periodic in time with

the period T we have

A(x, t) =

∞

Xn=−∞

bn(x) exp (−inωt),

(14)

2

where ω = 2π/T . In the interval (xi−1, xi) coeﬃcients
bn(x) assume constant values, which we shall denote as
bi,n. Using the condition of the continuity of the wave-
function ψi(x, t) at the point xi−1, we compute the ele-
ments of the matrices B+ and B−,

B±(i, x)M,N = BM −N (±pi,N ) exp (±ipi,N x).

(15)

On the other hand elements of the B′ matrix can be
evaluated by substituting a general solution (8) to the
expression (6) and applying the continuity condition to
it at xi−1. After some algebraic manipulations we obtain
ﬁnally the expression for the B′-matrices,

B′±

(i, x)M,N = ±

1
Xn=−∞
mi

ebi,nBM −N −n(±pi,N )

× exp (±ipi,N x),

(16)

(17)

(18)

and a set of equations for vectors Ci,

Ci = BiCi−1,

where

Bi = [B(i, xi−1)]−1B(i − 1, xi−1).

These relations allow to connect a solution in a given
domain xi−1 < x < xi with an analogous solution in any
other domain xj−1 < x < xj ,

Cj = BjBj−1, . . . , Bi+1Ci = TjiCi,

(19)

where Tji is the so-called transfer matrix [19, 21, 22].

IV. REFLECTION AND TRANSITION

PROBABILITIES

It is clear now that on the basis of Eq.(19) we can con-
nect solutions in the boundary domains (−∞, x0) and
(xL−1,∞). Values of mass m(x), scalar potential V (x)
and vector potential A(x, t) in these domains will be de-
noted as m0, V0, A0(t) and mL, VL, AL(t), respectively.
We can then write down solutions of (1) for each of these
domains. These solutions represent incident (ψinc), re-
ﬂected (ψref ) and transmitted (ψtr) waves, and take the
following form,

∞

ψinc(x, t) =

exp (−iEt) exp (−iM ωt)

XM =−∞
× BM (p0) exp(ip0x),

(20)

∞

ψref (x, t) =

C −
0,N exp (−iEt) exp (−iM ωt)

XN,M =−∞
× BM −N (−pN ) exp (−ipN x),

(21)

∞

ψtr(x, t) =

C +
L,N exp (−iEt) exp (−iM ωt)

XM =−∞
× BM −N (qN ) exp (iqN x),

where

we arrive at

T = T ++C +
0 = T −+C +

0 + T +−R,
0 + T −−R,

3

(33)

where R and T denote the columns of RN i TN , and
[C +
0 ]N = δ0,N . Thus, after some algebraic manipulations,
we have,

(22)

(23)

pN = p2m0(E + N ω − V0 − U0),
qN = p2mL(E + N ω − VL − UL).
0,N and C +

Constants C −
L,N will be denoted from now on
as RN and TN , respectively. Using continuity conditions
for functions deﬁned above, we get the probability conser-
vation equation for reﬂection and transition amplitudes,
RN and TN ,

XN >Nref

pN

p0 |RN|2 + XN >Ntr

m0qN
mLp0 |TN|2 = 1,

(24)

where summations are over such N for which pN and
qN are real, i.e., over the open channels. This equation
permits us to interpret

and

PR(N ) =

pN
p0 |RN|2

PT(N ) =

m0qN
mLp0 |TN|2

(25)

(26)

as reﬂection and transition probabilities for a tunneling
process in which absorption (N > 0) or emission (N < 0)
of energy N ω by electrons occurred [20, 22]. In case of a
monochromatic laser ﬁeld this process can be interpreted
as absorption or emission of N photons from the laser
ﬁeld.

The unitary condition (24) can be also interpreted as
the conservation of electric charge. To this end, let us de-
ﬁne the quantities proportional to the density of electric
currents,

Jinc =

p0
m0

,

Jref = XN >Nref
Jtr = XN >Ntr

pN
m0|RN|2,
qN
mL|TN|2.

(27)

(28)

(29)

Then Eq. (24) adopts the form of the ﬁrst Kirchhoﬀ low,

Jinc = Jref + Jtr.

(30)

Using (19) we can calculate constants C −
0,N = RN and
L,N = TN appearing in equations (20) - (22). Indeed,

C +
since

(31)
where transfer matrix T = TL0, and because T , C0 and
CL adopt the following block forms,

CL = T C0,

T = (cid:18) T ++ T +−

T −+ T −− (cid:19) , C0 = (cid:18) C +

0

R (cid:19) , CL = (cid:18) T

0 (cid:19) ,

(32)

R = −(T −−)−1T −+C +
0 .
T = (cid:0)T ++ − T +−(T −−)−1T −+(cid:1)C +

0 ,

(34)

which allows us to determine the quantities RN and
TN for a given transfer matrix T . For open channels,
these quantities are the amplitudes of reﬂection (RN ) and
transition (TN ) probabilities, from which one can com-
pute reﬂection and transition probabilities using equa-
tions (25) and (26).

V. THE SCATTERING MATRIX

We note from equations (15) and (16) that each of the
Bi matrices that constitute the transfer matrix Tji con-
tain elements exp(±ipi,N xi) that depend on the xi coor-
dinates at which the discontinuities appear. For closed
channels, that is when the pi,N momenta are purely imag-
inary, these numbers are real and may assume arbitrary
values, very large or very small, depending again on the
xi coordinates. Number of the Bi matrices is equal to
the number of discontinuity points, that is it depends on
how we divide the space into short intervals in order to
make our potential tractable by our algorithm. It may
therefore turn out that in order to compute the transfer
matrix Tji, we have to multiply a large number of the Bi
matrices, each containing both very small and very large
numbers. It is clear that such a procedure is numerically
unstable. We have to ﬁnd a way to modify our method
of calculations in order to compute the elements of each
Bi matrix at the same point x = 0 independently of
where the ‘real’ xi is. This would eliminate ”dangerous”
exp(±ipi,N xi) elements (turning them to 1), however at
the cost of appearing somewhere else. We shall see later
that these ‘left-overs’ of the shift into x = 0 appear only
as diﬀerences xi+1 − xi and therefore do not cause any
harmful side-eﬀects. We shall see now that such a mod-
iﬁcation is possible and the price we pay for it is worth
the eﬀort.

It follows from Eq. (19) that in the neighboring do-

mains, (xi−2, xi−1) and (xi−1, xi), we have,

Ci = Ti,i−1Ci−1.

(35)

Although the elements of the transfer matrix Ti,i−1 have
been computed from the continuity conditions at point
xi−1, one can compute them at any other point, for ex-
ample x = 0. To this end, let us notice what follows
from the form of the solution (8). Translation of the sys-
tem by a certain distance δ along the x-axis causes only

multiplication of each member of the sum over N in (8)
by a constant exp (iσpiN δ). These constants can be in-
cluded in coeﬃcients Cσ
iN . In this way we get a new set
of constants which we shall denote as ˜Cσ

iN ,

˜Cσ

iN = exp (iσpiN δ)Cσ

iN .

(36)

We shall interpret these constants as coeﬃcients in so-
lution (8), given by the continuity conditions at point
xi−1 − δ. Eq. (36) written in the matrix form becomes,
(37)

˜Ci = Pi(δ)Ci

where

and

Pi(δ) = (cid:18) P +

i (cid:19) .

(38)

(39)

In the equation above P σ

i (δ) is a diagonal matrix,

[P σ

i (δ)]N N ′ = δN N ′ exp (iσpiN δ),

(40)

i and ˜C ±

whereas C ±
i are the columns of the constants C ±
iN
and ˜C ±
i ]N =
C ±
iN . It follows from the form of the matrix Pi(δ) that
the following relations are satisﬁed:

iN respectively, that is [C ±

iN and [ ˜C ±

i ]N = C ±

P −1

i

(δ) = Pi(−δ),

Pi(δ1)Pi(δ2) = Pi(δ1 + δ2).

(41)

(42)

Let us notice also that translation of the system deﬁned

above modiﬁes the transfer matrix Ti,i−1. We have

P −1

i

˜Ci = Ci = Ti,i−1Ci−1
= Ti,i−1P −1

i−1(δ)Pi−1(δ)Ci−1,

thus

˜Ci = Pi(δ)Ti,i−1P −1

i−1(δ) ˜Ci−1,

and we can write it down as

where

˜Ci = ˜Ti,i−1 ˜Ci−1,

˜Ti,i−1 = Pi(δ)Ti,i−1P −1

i−1(δ).

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

Matrix elements denoted with the tilde symbol refer to
the translated system. Using the method deﬁned above
and the relation (19), we can connect now the solu-
tion in the domain (−∞, x0) with the solution in any
other domain (xi−1, xi). In this way the elements of the
transfer matrix, which have been computed until now at
the points of discontinuity x0 . . . xi−1, are computed now

each time at the same point x = 0. Let us illustrate this
method for a special case of i = 3

(47)

Equation (47) connects constants C0 and C3 using the
matrices T 0
j,j−1 all computed at x = 0 independently
of j, and diagonal matrices Pj(δj), given by the rela-
tions (38) and (40), where δj = (xj − xj−1). Edge ma-
trices P0(x0) and P −1
3 (x2) in the equation (47) can be
omitted while computing the transmission and reﬂection
probability amplitudes since their only role is to multi-
ply the amplitudes by phase quotients which disappear
while computing the probabilities. Although these matri-
ces lead to signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of the closed channels
in the domains of x < x0 and x > x3 in this particular
case, these channels do not inﬂuence the reﬂection and
transition amplitudes. Transmission and reﬂection prob-
abilities can thus be computed using a modiﬁed transfer
matrix,
T 0
3,0 = T 0

3,2P2(x2 − x1)T 0

(48)

The matrices T 0
i,i−1 are equal to the matrices Bi in Eq.
(18) calculated however for xi−1 = 0. This fact speeds
up numerical calculations since now matrix B(i, x = 0)
in Eq. (18) have to be inverted only once. Further on we
shall omit the superscript 0 in T and the tilde over C in
order to simplify notation.
The method presented above is still numerically unsta-
ble. The reason for this instability lies in the existence of
large numerical values of elements of the P −
i (δ) matrix
for imaginary momenta piN . In other words, for

the source of numerical instabilities are matrix elements

i,i−1 that contain large numbers. There is however a
chance for improving the stability, if only its reverse will
be used, (cid:0)T −−
It appears that it is possible pro-
vided that in our numerical algorithm only the so-called
scattering matrix will be applied. For this reason we will
show below how to compute the scattering matrix, Sj,i,
using only elements of the transfer matrix, Tj,i. For the
transfer matrix Tj,i we have,
j (cid:19) = (cid:18) T ++

On the basis of (51) we now want to compute the el-
ements of the Sj,i matrix. This matrix is supposed to

(52)

Using the set of linear equations (51), we easily compute
the coeﬃcients C −
j on the left-hand side of equa-
tion (52), as functions of the coeﬃcients C −
i . We
get then the following relations,

by checking that the condition (24) is satisﬁed with an
error smaller than 10−14. Such an accuracy can never be
achieved for systems with a large number of discontinuity
points if the transfer matrix is applied.

VI. PHOTO-EMISSION

In our model investigations, we concentrate on some
essential features of the solid-vacuum interface, as ex-
empliﬁed by the Sommerfeld model, in which the band
structure is neglected. This simpliﬁcation allows us to
consider a quite general form of the laser ﬁeld. To be
more speciﬁc, the solid surface is described by a contin-
uous step potential

Finally we compute the elements of the matrix Sj,i,

V (x) = V0g(x/w0),

,

with

j,i (T −−

j,i )−1T −+
j,i (cid:1),

(54)
As expected, the matrix Sj,i contains only numerically
stable elements (T −−
It follows from Eq. (19) that the transfer matrix Tj,i
can be written as the product of two transfer matrices,
Tj,k and Tk,i (i < k < j),

j,i )−1.

Tj,i = Tj,kTk,i,

where matrices Tj,k and Tk,i are deﬁned as follows,

Ck = Tk,iCi,
Cj = Tj,kCk.

(55)

(56)

Applying the method presented above, for each of the
transfer matrices Tj,k and Tk,i we can construct a scat-
tering matrix, Sj,k and Sk,i respectively. Elements of
the scattering matrix Sj,i can be computed using only
elements of the matrices Sj,k and Sk,i. Using the nota-
tion above, we obtain the following expressions for the
elements of the Sj,i matrix,

S ++
j,i =S ++

j,i =S +−

(57)

It is clear from the above that the Sj,i matrix is not
merely a product of two matrices Sj,k and Sk,i, but rather
a complicated nonlinear composition of them. It is im-
portant however to note that despite its evident complex-
ity, such a construction of the scattering matrix is numer-
ically stable, as opposed to the transfer matrix method
which fails if a system with a large number of discon-
tinuity points xi is considered. Stability of such an al-
gorithm has been proven in our numerical investigations

(58)

(59)

g(x) = 1/(1 + e−x).

The parameter w0 determines the skin depth of a surface.
For w0 = 0, the surface potential represents the step
function, commonly used in the Sommerfeld model. In
our illustrations, we put w0 = 5. We apply our theory
to the gold surface and assume that the electron eﬀective
mass is close to the free electron mass. The work function
and the Fermi energy for the gold metal are equal to 5.1
and 5.53 eV, respectively. This means that the constant
V0 above (as the sum of the work function and the Fermi
energy) equals 10.63 eV.

The surface potential described above can be gen-
eralized further to meet conditions suitable for other
solids. In particular, one can take into account the space-
dependent eﬀective mass of electrons in semiconductor
heterostructures or metals with eﬀective masses diﬀerent
from the free electron mass.

On the other hand, the form of the laser ﬁeld is as-
sumed to depend on both space and time coordinates.
Since, for laser pulses of duration ∼ 30 fs and the 800
nm wavelength, the monochromatic approximation works
well, we therefore adopt the following form for the laser
electric ﬁeld:

E(x, t) = E0(x) sin(ωt) = E0fL(x)(cid:0)1 + ǫfP (x)(cid:1) sin(ωt),

(60)

where

fL(x) = g(x/ζL − aL)g(bL − x/µL),

(61)

and similarly

fP (x) = g(x/ζP − aP )g(bP − x/µP ).

(62)

The parameter ǫ deﬁnes the plasmon-enhanced part of
the laser ﬁeld. For the incident laser beam, we choose
the Ti:sapphire laser beam of frequency ω = 1.5498 eV
(λ = 800 nm). This means that inside the solid the

laser ﬁeld intensity averaged over the time period decays
exponentially,

I(x) ∼ e2x/ζL.

(63)

On the other hand, in vacuum, it stays constant close
to the surface, and then again decays exponentially. In
this way, we can mimic a real physical situation in which
the radiation-ﬁlled space is ﬁnite. In our illustrations, we
take ζL = 40, which means that the penetration depth of
the laser ﬁeld intensity equals ζL/2 = 20. The parameter
aLζL describes the distance in a solid at which the in-
tensity is not reduced substantially. On the other hand,
bLµL corresponds to the laser focus diameter in vacuum,
whereas µL alone determines the intensity reduction rate
outside the focus. Similar parameters with the subscript
P refer to the plasmon-enhanced part of the laser ﬁeld.
The remaining parameters have been chosen as follows:
aL = 3, bL = 20, µL = 100, aP = 1, ζP = 8, bP = 4,
µP = 20, and ǫ = 0, . . . , 5. All dimensional parameters
are in atomic units.

In our discussions presented below, the laser ﬁeld in-
tensity is characterized by the dimensionless parameter

energy of electrons in the monochromatic electromag-
netic plane wave of frequency ω; hence E0 = 2ω√ωξ.

ous step potential V (x) and the electric ﬁeld amplitude

FIG. 2. (Color online) Total photo-emission probabilities as
functions of the kinetic energy of electrons for ξ = 0.1 and for
six values of ǫ.

We plot it in Fig. 2 as a function of the electron kinetic
energy for ξ = 0.1 and for six values of ǫ. We clearly
see the multi-photon structure in this distribution, i.e.,
the total probability jumps sometimes by a few orders of
magnitude if the smaller number of laser photons is suﬃ-
cient for photo-emission. As expected, the plasmon eﬀect
usually increases the photo-emission probability. More-
over, the energy of the multi-photon channel opening in-
creases with increasing ǫ, which is due to the increase of
the space-dependent ponderomotive energy of the laser
ﬁeld. The signiﬁcance of this eﬀect for the tunneling phe-
nomena is going to be discussed in due course.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

As mentioned above, our algorithm is convergent pro-
vided that a suﬃcient number of discretization points is
introduced. For systems considered here, this number
should not be smaller than 100. If the laser ﬁeld is very
weak, this does not create signiﬁcant numerical problems,
except that calculations become longer. However, when
the laser ﬁeld is suﬃciently intense, the algorithm based
on the transfer matrix is unstable. This instability is due
to the existence of closed channels, which introduce into
numerical calculations very small and very large numbers
at the same time. Augmenting precisions signiﬁcantly
slows down the calculation and does not diminish the
problem. We have found that it is possible to make this
algorithm numerically stable by just applying nonlinear
matrix transformations, without introducing higher pre-
cisions.

Illustrations presented in this paper show that photo-
emission of electrons can be changed signiﬁcantly by
applied nonperturbative oscillating in time and space-
dependent electric ﬁeld. The eﬃciency of the algorithm
presented in this contribution opens up the possibility of
investigating surface phenomena in the presence of more
realistic laser pulses that gradually decrease within solids

and extend on a mesoscopic scale in vacuum.
