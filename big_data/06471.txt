Abstract

Pure spin currents in semiconductors are essential for implementation in the next generation of spintronic elements. Het-
erostructures of III- nitride semiconductors are currently employed as central building-blocks for lighting and high-power devices.
Moreover, the long relaxation times and the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in these materials indicate them as privileged hosts
for spin currents and related phenomena. Spin pumping is an eﬃcient mechanism for the inception of spin current and its
conversion into charge current in non-magnetic metals and semiconductors with Rashba SOC via spin Hall eﬀects. We report
on the generation in n-GaN:Si – at room temperature and through spin pumping – of pure spin current, fundamental for the
understanding of the spin dynamics in these non-centrosymmetric Rashba systems. We ﬁnd for n-GaN:Si a spin Hall angle
θSH=3.03 × 10−3, exceeding by one order of magnitude those reported for other semiconductors, pointing at III-nitrides as
particularly eﬃcient spin current generators.

In the emerging ﬁeld of spin-orbitronics1–4 spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is employed in both magnetic and non-
magnetic materials to generate, exploit and detect spin currents. Spin currents hold the key for the realization
and implementation of the next generation of spin based nanoelectronic devices with properties like non-volatility,
low power consumption and dissipation. While in magnetic materials the SOC is employed to create new classes
of topological objects like magnetic skyrmions or Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya domain walls1,5, spin-orbitronics in non-
magnetic materials mostly addresses the spin -to -charge conversion through the spin Hall eﬀect (SHE)6 and the
Rashba-Edelstein eﬀect7,8. The concept of SHE is borrowed from the anomalous Hall eﬀect (AHE) where, due to the
relativistic SOC, asymmetric deﬂection of charge carriers takes place depending on their spin orientations9. While
AHE is studied in magnetic systems, SHE is mostly observed in non-magnetic ones. Based on the concept of spin
dependent Mott scattering10, the SHE was predicted nearly four decades ago by D’yakonov and Perel’11 and was
proposed to be the eﬀective process for producing pure spin currents in solid state systems. However, it was not until
the theoretical work of Hirsch et al.12 and Zhang et al.13, that the extrinsic SHE received renewed attention. The
possibility of an intrinsic mechanism was proposed by various theoretical groups14–16. The intrinsic SHE depends
only on the electronic band structure of the material. This eﬀect arises from the nonequilibrium dynamics of the
Bloch electrons as they undergo spin precession due to an induced k–dependent eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld, such as the
Rashba ﬁeld. The extrinsic SHE, on the other hand, is the mechanism in which the spins acquire transverse velocity
due to SOC during scattering of electrons6,9,17. The extrinsic SHE is classiﬁed according to two diﬀerent underlying
mechanisms viz. the skew scattering and the side jump mechanism. Skew scattering is the asymmetric scattering
of spin, within the scattering plane, due to an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld gradient that arises as an eﬀect of the SOC.
The scattering plane deﬁnes the spin polarization direction of the resulting spin current. The side jump mechanism
is the velocity integrated over time of deﬂection of electrons in opposite directions by the electric ﬁelds experienced
when approaching or withdrawing an impurity. This phenomenon results in an eﬀective transverse displacement of
the electrons upon multiple scattering events. At low carrier mobilities ∼(10−2-102) cm2V−1s−1, the intrinsic and
extrinsic side jump mechanisms contribute mostly to the SHE, while for carrier mobilities greater than 102 cm2V−1s−1,
extrinsic skew scattering is the dominant process6,17. Moreover, for mobilites exceeding 103 cm2V−1s−1, spin Coulomb
drag becomes the dominant mechanism17 and compels the spin Hall conductivity towards a saturation value. The
lack of direct electrical signals proved to be a major challenge in the observation of this eﬀect, so that the initial
experimental eﬀorts were mostly accomplished using optical means18–20.

In a series of seminal publications, Tserkovnyak, Brataas and Bauer21–23 suggested a method for obtaining pure
spin current in non-magnetic (NM) metals and semiconductors with non-negligible SOC. They proposed a spin
battery23 based on adiabatic pumping of spins from a ferromagnetic metal or insulator (FM) grown in a FM/NM
bilayer conﬁguration when the system is driven to resonance under microwave irradiation. Such a battery leads to
the dynamic generation of pure spin current in a NM with non triﬂing SOC via ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of
the FM24. The magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets is well described by the phenomenological Landau-Lifshitz-
Gilbert (LLG) equation25 :

d ~M (t)

dt

= −γ ~M (t) × ~Heﬀ +

α
Ms

~M (t) ×

d ~M (t)

(1)

where ~M (t)/Ms is the unit vector of magnetization, γ the gyromagnetic ratio and ~Heﬀ the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld
expressed as ~Heﬀ = ~H + ~HM(t) + ~h(t), with ~H the external magnetic ﬁeld, ~HM(t) the dynamic demagnetizing ﬁeld
and ~hMW(t) the ac ﬁeld due to microwave radiation. The magnetization ~M (t), is expressed as a sum of the static and
dynamic components, i.e. ~M (t) = ~M + ~m(t) and the dimensionless coeﬃcient α is the Gilbert damping parameter.
The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. (1) is the precession term, while the second term represents a damping
component that impels the precession of magnetization ~M (t) to spiral down to a static magnetization axis due to
the Gilbert damping parameter α. In a FM/NM hybrid bilayer, α is enhanced due to the transfer of spin angular
momentum from the FM to the NM through a dynamical process of adiabatic spin pumping22,24,26,27. The spins
pumped in the NM are scattered by the eﬀective spin-orbit ﬁeld i.e. the Rashba ﬁeld and a spin accumulation is
achieved in the NM, leading to a spin current in the NM through SHE. An enhanced α in a FM/NM bilyer is a
signature of spin pumping and a ﬁngerprint of the generation of pure spin current in the NM. The spin current is
converted into charge current, through a reciprocal process called the inverse spin Hall eﬀect (ISHE) via the relation:
~Jc = θSH ~Js × ~σ, where θSH is the spin Hall angle representing the eﬃciency of spin-to-charge conversion of a material.
The charge current in the NM with SOC induces an electromotive force (emf), whose direction is perpendicular to
the spin current ~Js and to the spin polarization vector ~σ. Spin pumping is an eﬃcient mechanism to convert spin
current into charge current without any applied bias. Over the last few years several experimental works have been
published demonstrating spin pumping in heavy metals like Pt [26, 28–31], Ta [32 and 33], Pd [31 and 34], Au [35], in
semiconductors like GaAs [36 and 37], Si [34 and 38], Ge [39] and ZnO [40 and 41] and recently also in 3D topological

insulators [42] and ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors [43]. Apart from ferromagnetic spin pumping from a metallic
FM like permalloy (Py), it was also shown that spin currents can be realised in bilayers like Pt/YIG [44–46] based on
ferromagnetic insulators. Recent reports also point to spin pumping from paramagnets 47 and antiferromagnets48,49.
The successful generation and control of spin current in semiconductors using the mechanism of spin pumping would
open wide perspectives for the integration of spin functionalities in state-of-the-art electronic and optoelectronic
devices based on semiconductors like Si, Ge, III-nitrides, III-arsenides etc.

Amongst the conventional III-V semiconductors, GaN and its alloys AlGaN and InGaN have emerged as strategic
materials for optoelectronic and electronic applications, primarily due to their tunable wide bandgap and structure
induced polarization. Furthermore, transition metal doped III-nitrides have been studied extensively in the past decade
as workbench magnetic semiconductors50,51. Another fundamental aspect, namely the presence of Rashba spin orbit
coupling (RSOC)52,53, was recently demonstrated in degenerate wurtzite (wz) n-GaN:Si [54]. Using magnetotransport
measurements it was shown that the Rashba parameter, αR, linear in k and accounting for the spin splitting of the
conduction band in wz-GaN, has a quantitative value measured for n-GaN:Si to be ∼ (4.5 ± 1.0) meV·˚A i.e. the same
magnitude found for a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the AlGaN/GaN interface54. In this work it was
shown that in polar wz-GaN, the inversion asymmetry associated with the wurtzite crystal structure dominates over
the interfacial electric ﬁeld in the conduction band of GaN. The RSOC in degenerate n-GaN:Si makes this material
a spin Hall system for prospective spin-orbitronic applications based on III-nitride semiconductors. Here we report
on the generation of pure spin currents in n-GaN:Si using an adiabatic spin pumping technique and we estimate the
spin Hall angle for n-GaN:Si. The evaluation of the spin-to-charge conversion eﬃciency in n-GaN:Si opens up the
possibility to design and implement high performance spin based III-nitride nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.

I. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The experiments have been performed on a 1.9 µm thick degenerately doped n-GaN:Si ﬁlm with electron concen-
tration (1.2× 1019) cm−3 and carrier mobility, µ ∼ 180 cm2V−1s−1, grown by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy
(MOVPE) on c-Al2O3. A 10 nm permalloy (Py = Ni80Fe20) ﬁlm is used as FM layer and source of spins. The Py
ﬁlm is passivated with a 6 nm AlOx ﬁlm which protects the FM from oxidation in order to avoid the detrimental
eﬀects of oxidised Py on the spin pumping eﬃciency55. The Py/n-GaN:Si bilayer is driven to resonance conditions
at room temperature under an X-band microwave excitation of (9.44 ± 0.01) GHz with an external magnetic ﬁeld in
a Bruker Elexsys E580 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer. The permalloy – being a soft FM – has a small
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, so that ~M (t) in Py is aligned along the ﬁlm plane when an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld ~H
is applied. Ohmic contacts to n-GaN:Si are fabricated by e-beam evaporation of Ti/Au/Al/Ti/Au as a metallic stack.
The quartz sample holder for the FMR measurements is provided with two high conducting copper wires and
connected to a Keithley 2700 DMM for measuring the generated dc voltage. The dc voltage due to inverse spin
Hall-, thermal- and galvanomagnetic-eﬀects is measured and the value of the component due to inverse spin Hall
eﬀect is employed to calculate the spin Hall angle in n-GaN:Si. Control experiments are also performed on contacted
n-GaN:Si without Py, on Py/c-Al2O3, on bare c-Al2O3 substrates and on the wired sample holder solely. However, no
measurable voltage or FMR absorption have been detected from these test samples and control experiments, ruling
out experimental artefacts aﬀecting the observed results.

II. DETECTION OF SPIN HALL EFFECT IN n-GaN:Si

A schematic representation of the spin pumping mechanism and of the geometry employed for the detection of the
generated spin current in the NM are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The sketches depict the magnetization
precession in the FM for an applied magnetic ﬁeld ~H at resonance condition under microwave excitation, leading to
the pumping of spin angular momentum and subsequent generation of spin and charge currents in the NM through
the SHE and ISHE. Measurements are carried out with the magnetic ﬁeld applied in the in-plane and out-of-plane
conﬁguration, respectively.

Spin pumping is quenched for a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld and the angle dependent measurement of the emf
is essential to rule out secondary eﬀects or experimental artefacts. The direction of the applied magnetic ﬁeld w.r.t
the sample plane is indicated in Fig. 1(c), while the ﬁrst derivative of the FMR signal for Py/c-Al2O3 and Py/n-
GaN:Si/c-Al2O3 is provided in Fig. 1(d). The dotted and solid lines represent the FMR line-shapes for Py/c-Al2O3
and for the Py/n-GaN:Si bilayer, respectively. The broadening of the FMR signal for the Py/GaN:Si bilayer w.r.t.
the reference Py/c-Al2O3 layer is the evidence of adiabatic spin pumping from the ferromagnetic Py into the Rashba
semiconductor n-GaN:Si under resonance conditions24,26,39. The FMR signal and the electric potential diﬀerence
between the electrodes attached to the n-GaN:Si layer are measured to detect the ISHE.

applied magnetic ﬁeld w.r.t. the sample surface and (d) ~H dependence of the FMR signals dI(H)/dH measured at T = 300 K
for Py/c-Al2O3 and Py/n-GaN:Si bilayer at θH = 0◦.

The dynamics of the magnetization ~M (t) in Py under an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld ~Heﬀ is described by the LLG
Eq. (1). In FMR regime, the spin pumping driven by dynamical exchange interaction, pumps into n-GaN:Si pure spin
current, which gets converted into charge current via ISHE, according to the relation ~Jc = θSH ~Js × ~σ, as discussed
earlier. The charge current in the Rashba semiconductor leads to an emf proportional to the generated spin current
and whose amplitude is proportional to the microwave absorption and maximized at the resonance ﬁeld HFMR.

The emf VH generated in the NM n-GaN:Si is detected simultaneously with the FMR and at the resonance ﬁeld
a peak is observed in the measured voltage. The experimental emf is plotted as a function of the applied magnetic
ﬁeld ~H and reported in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) respectively for θH = 0◦ and θH = 180◦. The angles 0◦ and 180◦ deﬁne
the directions of the applied in-plane magnetic ﬁeld in accordance to the geometry provided in Fig. 1(c). Since the
Rashba-Edelstein eﬀect is observed in 2DEGs and in materials with giant Rashba SOC56, and given that the system
treated here belongs to neither of these two classes, the observed emf is attributed to the interplay between SHE
and ISHE. The experimental emf VH is a superposition of the voltage due to ISHE in the n-GaN:Si layer26,57 and of
spurious voltages originating from galvanomagnetic eﬀects like ordinary Hall eﬀect (OHE) in n-GaN:Si, anomalous
Hall eﬀect (AHE), planar Hall eﬀect (PHE) in the Py layer and thermal heating eﬀects due to microwave irradiation58.
The voltage originating from these spurious mechanisms can be separated from the one due to ISHE by ﬁtting the
experimental data with the function26 :

where Γ is the half line width of the FMR line-shape and HFMR is the resonance ﬁeld. The symmetric part of

the total voltage function, VSymΓ 2/(cid:2)(H − HFMR)2 + Γ 2(cid:3) with an absorption line-shape is the contribution of the

θH = 180◦ for PMW = 200 mW. Dots: experimental data; solid lines: ﬁtting according to Eq. (2).

ISHE voltage, VISHE, developed in n-GaN:Si due to the adiabatic spin pumping and to heating eﬀects. On the

other hand, the asymmetric part of the function, VAsym [−2Γ (H − HFMR)] /(cid:2)(H − HFMR)2 + Γ 2(cid:3) with a dysonian

dispersion line-shape is a consequence of the contributions from AHE and OHE, as discussed earlier. The Hall voltages
VAsym change sign across HFMR, while VISHE – being proportional to the integrated microwave absorption intensity –
is symmetric across HFMR, as expected from the fundamental spin pumping model25,26. A ﬁtting of the measured
emf at a microwave power of 200 mW with Eq. (2) for θH = 0◦ yields VSym = 2.80 µV and VAsym = −0.453 µV .
The ratio VSym/VAsym ∼ 6 indicates that the major contribution to the measured voltage is provided by the eﬃcient
conversion of spin-to-charge current due to an interplay of spin pumping and direct and inverse spin Hall eﬀects. The
spurious heating eﬀects from the microwave irradiation can be further eliminated by averaging the symmetric voltage
for parallel and antiparallel orientation of the applied ﬁeld H according to :

VISHE(θH) =

VSym(θH) − VSym(θH + 180◦)

2

(3)

This approach to the treatment of the data is justiﬁed, since VISHE changes sign upon reversal of the magnetic ﬁeld
owing to a change of sign of the spin polarization vector ~σ, not occurring for the voltage due to the microwave heating
eﬀects. Thus, for spin pumping experiments, the measured emf VH includes contributions from both symmetric and
asymmetric voltages, and the actual ISHE voltage VISHE is estimated by a proper treatment of the measured data.
It was reported30,36,59,60, that the symmetric voltage can also include contributions from PHE and galvanomagnetic
eﬀects in the metallic FM layer due to the electric and magnetic ﬁeld components of the microwave. However, the
angular dependence of the emf w.r.t. the external magnetic ﬁeld showed that the contribution of the ISHE to the
symmetric voltages at least ﬁve times greater than the ones from the PHE60. In the above mentioned works, the
thickness of the NM layer was of the order of the spin diﬀusion length λN, while the thickness of n-GaN:Si studied here
is 1.9 µm, i.e. much greater than λN ∼ 80 nm in n-GaN. The fact that the thickness of the NM is orders of magnitude
greater than λN suppresses the backﬂow spin current into the metallic FM, further reducing the contributions to the
emf from galvanomagnetic eﬀects. Careful identiﬁcation and estimation of the various components of the generated

5

emf in the NM layer in a spin pumping experiment is therefore essential for the estimation of the spin-to-charge
conversion eﬃciency of a material. Here, for the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld, after eliminating the heating eﬀects, a
VISHE = 3.25 µV is obtained and is exploited for the quantitative evaluation of the spin Hall angle for n-GaN:Si.

Figure 3. Dependence of the measured voltage on the applied microwave power for in-plane magnetic ﬁeld orientations at
(a) θH = 0◦ and (c) θH = 180◦. Dependence of the VSym and VAsym for diﬀerent microwave powers for (b) θH = 0◦ and (d)
θH = 180◦.

The dependence of the measured emf on the applied microwave power under FMR conditions is shown in Figs. 3(a)
and 3(c) for orientations of the magnetic ﬁeld θH = 0◦ and θH = 180◦, respectively. For a microwave power of 200 mW,
the measured voltages at FMR conditions are +2.849 µV for θH = 0◦ and -3.840 µV for θH = 180◦. It is to be noted
here that the voltages reported in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) contain both the symmetric and asymmetric contributions. After
separating the symmetric and asymmetric voltage components, the symmetric part of the voltage, VSym is plotted
as a function of PMW and shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(d) for θH = 0◦ and θH = 180◦, respectively. Now, being VISHE
proportional to the square of the microwave magnetic ﬁeld (hMW), it is expected to be linearly proportional to the
microwave power PMW [39 and 57]. This is validated in Figs. 3(b) and 3(d) for θH = 0◦ and θH = 180◦, respectively.
The reversal of ~H causes ~σ to change sign, which in turn induces the change in sign of the ISHE electric ﬁeld ~EISHE,
as evidenced in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c). It can be concluded that the fundamental relation for the ISHE, ~Jc = θSH ~Js × ~σ
operates in the studied Py/n-GaN:Si bilayer system. For an applied magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the sample plane,
i.e. θH = 90◦, the amplitude of VISHE is quenched even though a FMR signal for the Py is detected at the resonance
ﬁeld of 1245 mT. This result provides the necessary and suﬃcient conﬁrmation of spin pumping through SHE and
ISHE in n-GaN:Si.

III. ESTIMATION OF SPIN HALL ANGLE IN n-GaN:Si

The magnetization precession described by the LLG Eq. (1) drives the spin pumping in the Py/n-GaN:Si ﬁlm.
Within the fundamental model of spin pumping proposed by Tserkovnyak et al.21, the dc component of the generated
spin current density j0

where g and µB are the Land´e g factor and the Bohr magneton, WFM/NM and WNM the spectral width of the

to be
(1.38×1018) m−2. Using Eqs. (6) and (7) and with the parameters γ=(1.86×1011) T−1s−1, hMW = 0.15 mT, ¯h=(1.054×
10−34) Js, λN = 80 nm, dN = 1.9 µm, w = 3 mm, dF = 10 nm, σN=(3.5587 × 104) Ω−1m−1, σF =(1.6 × 106) Ω−1m−1,
j0
s =(1.2254 × 10−10) Jm−2 and VISHE = 3.25 µV we ﬁnd the spin Hall angle for n-GaN:Si to be θSH = 3.03 × 10−3, at
least one order of magnitude higher than those reported for Si [38], Ge[64], ZnO [41] and n-GaAs [6 and 65]. The spin
Hall angle θSH depends on both the side jump and the skew scattering mechanisms. Theoretically29 the side jump
contribution to θSH is given by (3/8)1/2(kFλN)−1, which corresponds to 1.08 × 10−2 in the case under consideration
. The theoretical value is at least one order of magnitude higher than the one obtained experimentally. Deﬁning the
evolution of SHE in terms of mobility of the system in question according to Vignale et al.17, with µ ∼ 180 cm2V−1s−1,
n-GaN:Si falls in the limit of clean-ultraclean regime, which is dominated by the skew scattering. Considering the
above mentioned overestimation of the magnitude of the side jump contribution and the consequent discrepancy
between the theoretical and experimental values of θSH, one can infer that SHE in n-GaN:Si is dominated by skew
scattering.

The experiments discussed above for the 1.9 µm thick n-GaN:Si layer have been carried out also on a 150 nm thick
n-GaN:Si ﬁlm. Like in the case of the 1.9 µm n-GaN:Si sample, an AlOx passivated 10 nm Py ﬁlm is used as the
source of spin. The spin Hall voltage measured in the 150 nm thick n-GaN:Si is reported in Fig. 4. Here, the intensity
of the asymmetric component of the voltage is more than one order of magnitude higher than the one observed for

the 1.9 µm n-GaN:Si sample, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). For a NM layer thinner than its spin diﬀusion length
λN, the spin backﬂow current Ibf from the NM to FM exceeds the forward spin current due to spin pumping Isp [25
and 66]. In such a scenario, VISHE due to the inverse spin Hall eﬀect cannot be detected in the NM. However, the
asymmetric voltages can still be seen, being independent of spin pumping. In the present case of n-GaN:Si, the spin
diﬀusion length is λN ∼ 80 nm. It was reported that for NM metal systems, the asymmetry voltage contribution for a
ﬁlm thickness of the order of λN is close to 100% of the total emf measured. This is due to the dominance of Ibf over
Isp [67]. However, with a greater thickness of the NM ﬁlm, the asymmetric contribution diminishes and approaches
a minimum saturation value for a ﬁlm thickness ≫ λN. Furthermore, it was reported by Flovik et al.68 that this
strong VAsym could be assigned to Eddy current eﬀects and it was shown that in the case of a NM layer of Pt, the
asymmetry decreases considerably with increasing the thickness of the NM layer. In the systems considered here, for
a thin layer of n-GaN:Si the spin backﬂow is likely to be the dominant mechanism that leads to the suppression of the
Vsym signal, since the Oersted ﬁelds induce a signiﬁcant distortion of the FMR lineshape, not observed for the 1.9 µm
thick n-GaN:Si sample. For the case of ZnO, also a wide band gap wurtzite semiconductor like GaN, D’Ambrosio
et al. [40] reported the measured emf from the ZnO layer in a Py/ZnO bilayer under FMR conditions, as due to PHE
in the Py layer. In our case of n-GaN:Si, the control experiments – as previously mentioned –did not reveal any
measurable voltage due to PHE in the Py layer. Moreover, the thickness of the ZnO ﬁlm used in case of D’Ambrosio
et al. was 200 nm, making spin backﬂow a likely reason for the observed dominant contribution from PHE. On the
other hand, in our case for calculating the spin Hall angle θSH we carry out measurements on a 1.9 µm thick n-GaN:Si
layer, which can be considered as a bulk system where the role of spin backﬂow is largely suppressed – as discussed
previously in detail – upon comparison with the 150 nm n-GaN:Si layer. A detailed investigation of the dependence
of spin pumping on the thickness and carrier concentration of n-GaN:Si is needed for an in-depth understanding of
this behaviour.

IV. SUMMARY

We have provided experimental demonstration of spin pumping induced spin current generation and its detection
at room temperature using the ISHE in the Rashba semiconductor n-GaN:Si. From the fundamental model of

8

spin pumping, a spin mixing conductance of (1.38 × 1018) m−2 for the Py/n-GaN:Si interface and a spin Hall angle
θSH = 3.03 × 10−3 for wz n-GaN:Si are found. The value obtained for θSH is at least one order of magnitude higher
than those of other semiconductors like Si, Ge, ZnO and n-GaAs. The experimental demonstration of generation of
pure spin current in n-GaN:Si and its enhanced spin-charge conversion eﬃciency over other functional semiconductors
points at III-nitrides as model systems for studies on spin-related phenomena in non-centrosymmetric semiconductors.
Moreover, this work paves the way to the realization of nitride-based low power optoelectronic, non-volatile and low
dissipative spin devices like e.g. spin batteries.
