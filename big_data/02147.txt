We make an intensive investigation of the soft mode at the QCD critical point on the basis of the
the functional renormalization group (FRG) method in the local potential approximation. We calculate
the the spectral functions ρσ,π(ω, p) in the scalar (σ) and pseudoscalar (π) channels beyond the random
phase approximation in the quark-meson model. At ﬁnite baryon chemical potential µ with a ﬁnite quark
mass, the baryon-number ﬂuctuation is coupled to the scalar channel and the spectral function in the σ
channel has a support not only in the time-like (ω > p) and but also in the space-like (ω < p) regions,
which correspond to the mesonic and the particle-hole phonon excitations, respectively. We ﬁnd that the
energy of the peak position of the latter becomes vanishingly small with the height being enhanced as the
system approaches the QCD critical point, which is a manifestation of the fact that the phonon mode is
the soft mode associated with the second-order transition at the QCD critical point, as was suggested by
some authors. Moreover, our extensive calculation of the spectral function in the (ω, p) plane enables us
to see that the mesonic and the phonon modes have the respective deﬁnite dispersion relations ωσ,ph(p),
and it turns out that ωσ(p) crosses the light-cone line into the space-like region, and then eventually
merge into the phonon mode as the system approches further close to the critical point. This implies
that the sigma-mesonic mode also becomes soft at the critical point. We also provide numerical stability
conditions that are necessary for obtaining the accurate eﬀective potential from the ﬂow equation.

1 Introduction

The phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a rich structure
and its clariﬁcation is one of the main topics in the high-energy and nuclear physics [1]. One
of remarkable features in the expected phase structure is the existence of the ﬁrst-order phase
boundary between the hadronic phase and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase at large baryon
chemical potential µ. In particular, the end point of the ﬁrst-order phase boundary is known as the
QCD critical point, where the phase transition becomes second order. Although lattice QCD, which
is a powerful non-perturbative ﬁrst-principle method for QCD, has a limited predictive power in
the case of large µ because of the sign problem [2–4], other QCD-motivated approaches, such
as chiral eﬀective models implementing relevant symmetries and functional methods with inputs
from lattice QCD, support the existence of the QCD critical point [5–15].

While the location of the QCD critical point in these calculations strongly depend on details
of the models and employed approximations [16–19], one may expect anomalous ﬂuctuations of
experimental observables in relatistic heavy ion collisions if the produced matter passes through
critical region where the thermodynamic quantities are strongly inﬂuenced by the existence of the
critical point [20]. In particular, the net-baryon number susceptibility and its higher order ones,
approximated by the net-proton ones in measurements [21], are expected to be sensitive to the
critical behavior of the system [17, 22–29]. A recent summary of measurements in the beam-
energy scan program at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) including intriguing behaviors of
the net-proton ﬂuctuations can be found in [30].

Although the mean-ﬁeld theory seems to give a reasonable picture of the phase structure, a
system near a critical point exhibits strong correlations among constituents. Therefore methods
beyond the mean-ﬁeld theory are desirable for understanding the physics near the critical point.
The functional renomalization group (FRG) [31–34] is one of the frameworks which enables us
to incorpolate ﬂuctuation eﬀects beyond the mean-ﬁeld theory; see also [35–37]. Indeed, it has
been pointed out that such ﬂuctuations play an important role in the aforementioned observables
[26, 28, 29, 38–40]. The FRG has been applied to a wide range of ﬁelds including the QCD phase
diagram and found to be useful in the description of chiral phase transition in QCD via eﬀective
chiral models [12, 19, 41–45].

For a second-order transition, there exist speciﬁc modes which are coupled to the ﬂuctuations
of the order parameter and become gapless and a long-life at the critical point. Such a mode is
called the soft mode of the phase transition. As for the QCD critical point, the nature of the soft
modes changes depending on whether the quarks have a mass or not [46, 47]: In the chiral limit
where the quarks are massless, the theory has exact chiral symmetry and O(4) critical line appears
in the (T, µ)-plane in the two-ﬂavor case; the critical line terminates at a point (the tricritical

2

point) in the (T, µ)-plane and is connected to a ﬁrst order phase transition line [48]; the σ and
π mesonic modes in the time-like region become massless on the critical line, implying that the
quartet mesons are the soft modes of the chiral transition in the chiral limit [49, 50]. At ﬁnite
baryon chemical potential, however, the picture changes because the charge conjugation symmetry
is lost. When the chiral symmetry is broken, the mixed correlator hh ¯ψψ ¯ψγ0ψii does not vanish.
Then when the system approaches the tricritical point in the broken phase, the density ﬂuctuation
hh( ¯ψγ0ψ)2ii also shows a singular behavior. Furthermore, when the theory does not have chiral
symmetry due to the current quark masses from the outset, the nature of the phase transition and
the soft mode change drastically. In this case, the tricritical point turns to the critical point where
the universality class belongs to that of Z2 critical point and the soft mode is considered to be the
particle-hole mode corresponding to the density (and energy) ﬂuctuations. It is noteworthy that
not only the chiral susceptibility but also susceptibilities of the hydrodynamical modes such as
the density ﬂuctuation or the quark-number susceptibility diverge at the critical point owing to the
scalar-vector coupling caused by the ﬁnite quark mass at nonvanishing µ [51]. Such a picture is
suggested in the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and random phase approximation (RPA)
analysis of the Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model in [46] and the Langevin equation in [47].

Then it would be intriguing to apply the FRG for investigating the nature and dynamical prop-
erties of the soft mode at the critical point, which is the purpose of the present work. Here it shoud
be mentioned that the role of density ﬂuctuations on the static critical properties of the QCD critical
point has been investigated in FRG within a chiral quark-meson model [52], where analyzed are
static properties such as the quark-number susceptibility and the curvature (screening) masses in
the scalar and vector channels. The dynamical properties such as the dispersion relations of excita-
tion modes nor those of the soft modes at the QCD critical point have not been touched upon. We
note that these quantities can be read oﬀ from the spectral function in the relevant channel.

Needless to say, a real time analysis is needed for the investigation of the spectral functions for
exciation modes. Since analytic continuation of two-point functions from imaginary Matsubara
frequencies to real frequencies is necessary to get real-time two-point Green’s functions at ﬁnite
temperature, it is in general intricate to get the spectral functions numerically with a high accuracy
[53–56]. Recently a useful method for calculating the spectral functions within FRG has been
developed, which adopt an unambiguos way of the analytic continuation in the imagainary-time
formalism and leads to reasonable results of meson spectral functions in the O(4) model in vacuum
[57]. Furthermore, this method has been also successfully applied to the quark-meson model at
ﬁnite temperature and chemical potential [58, 59].

The spectral function in a speciﬁc channel with specﬁc quantum numbers may have more than
one peaks and bumps, the number of which can change according to that of parameters charac-
terizing the system such as temperature and baryon density. A peak or even bump in the spectral

3

function in the channel may be identiﬁed with a particle excitation in the channel, and the width of
the peak/bump shows the decay rate of the particle in a speciﬁc decay channel. This feature enables
one not only to explore the appearance but also to analyze the nature of modes in the system using
spectral functions in various channels. In particular, the spectral functions around a critical point
give information on the soft modes. Actually, the spectral function in the scalar-isoscalar chan-
nel, i.e., the sigma channel has been analyzed in RPA using Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in
[46], where it is shown that the spectral function has a prominent bump in the space-like region
corresponding to the phonon mode composed of particle-hole excitations, the peak position of
which moves to vanishingly small frequency as the system approaches the critical point whereas
the mesonic sigma mode in the time-like region does not show such a behavior retaining a ﬁnite
mass. This result clearly shows that the phonon mode (or hydrodynamical mode in general) is the
soft mode of the QCD critical point; see also [47, 60].

The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the nature of low-energy modes at the QCD
critical point beyond RPA using a two-ﬂavor quark-meson model: We calculate the spectral func-
tions in the σ and pion channels with FRG. Our results conﬁrm the softening of the particle-hole
mode in the σ channel near the QCD critical point, but not in the pion channel. In addition, we
ﬁnd that the low-momentum dispersion relation of sigma-mesonic mode penetrates into space-like
region and the mode merges into the bump of the particle-hole mode.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we recapitulate the method [58, 59] and describe
how to calculate the spectral functions in the mesonic channels numerically with FRG. The numer-
ical results are shown in Sec. 3. The phase diagram, the critical region and the precise location of
the critical point are presented in Sec. 3.2. In Sec. 3.4 the results of the spectral functions are
shown, and the soft mode at the QCD critical point is discussed. Sec. 4 is devoted to summary and
outlook. In Appendix A, the detailed forms of the FRG ﬂow equations after Matsubara summation
are shown. In Appendix B, we derive the conditions for numerically stable calculation of the ﬂow
equation as a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation.

2 Method

In this section, We recapitulate the method developed in [58, 59] for calculating spectral
functions in the quark-meson model with FRG, and present some details of our numerical
procedure.

2.1 Procedure to derive spectral functions in meson channels

FRG is based on the philosophy of the Wilsonian renormalization group and realizes the coarse
graining by introducing a regulator function Rk , which has a role to suppress lower-momentum

4

modes than the scale k for the respective ﬁeld. In this method, the eﬀective average action (EAA)
Γk is introduced such that it becomes bare action S Λ at a large UV scale k = Λ and becomes the
eﬀective action at k → 0 with an appropriate choice of regulators. The ﬂow equation for EAA, the
Wetterich equation, can be derived as a functional diﬀerential equation [34]:

is the n-th functional derivative of Γk with respect to ﬁelds. This equation has a one-loop

In principle, one can get the eﬀective action Γk=0 by solving Eq. (1) with the initial condition

ΓΛ = S Λ.

However, it is inhibitively diﬃcult to solve Eq. (1) in an exact way and some simpliﬁcations
are introduced for a practical use. One of the simpliﬁcations is to truncate the form of EAA. Since
our purpose is to reveal the behavior of the low-momentum modes around the QCD critical point,
we adopt a truncation in which the low-momentum ﬂuctuations are properly taken into account.

We should now specify the low-energy eﬀective model of QCD; we employ the two-ﬂavor
quark-meson model as such a model. Then we take the local potential approximation (LPA) for the
meson ﬂow part as our truncation. This truncation corresponds to considering only the lowest-order
of derivative expansion for the meson ﬂow part.

In imaginary-time formalism, our truncated EAA is as follows [43]:

where φ = (σ, ~π). The quark ﬁeld ψ has the indices of four-component spinor, color Nc = 3 and
ﬂavor N f = 2. The cσ represents the eﬀect of the current quark mass, which explicitly breaks
N f = 2 chiral symmetry. In this truncation, we also neglect the ﬂow of gs and the wave function
renormalization. Therefore, only the meson eﬀective potential Uk has a k-dependence.

Although the truncated EAA itself gives only simplest information about the momentum
dependence of two-point Green’s functions, the nonperturbative eﬀects are to be incorporated

through Eq. (1) with the truncated EAA used as the initial condition. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst
calculate the eﬀective potential Uk(φ2) using Eq. (1). Then the chiral condensate σ0 is obtained as
σ satisfying the quantum equation of motion (EOM) δΓk=0/δσ = 0. In our case, this condition cor-
responds to obtaining σ that minimizes Uk(σ2) − cσ, under the assumptions that the condensate
is homogeneous and h~πi = ~0. Next, we derive the ﬂow equations for two-point Green’s functions.

A real-time two-point Green’s function at ﬁnite temperature is obtained by analytic continua-
tion for the temperature Green’s function to real time, i.e., from imaginary Matsubara frequencies
to real frequencies in the case of momentum representation. In our case, such an analytic continua-
tion is successfully carried out at the level of the ﬂow equation after the Matsubara summations in
the RHS of Eq. (3), as follows: When one derives a retarded two-point Green’s function via ana-
lytic continuation in frequency ω plane, the analyticity of the Green’s function in the upper-half
plane of ω must be retained [61]. In the present case, the ﬂow equation itself should be analytic in
the upper-half plane after the analytic continuation. One can retain the analyticity in the upper-half

6

plane easily by taking into account the following points. First, by choosing ωn-independent regula-
tors, one can avoid possible extra poles in the ω plane in the ﬂow equation otherwise arising from
ωn dependence of the regulators. The second point is about the analytic continuation of thermal
distribution factors nB,F(E + iωn) obtained for discrete (multiple of 2πT ) frequency ωn such as
nB,F(E + iωn), where nB,F is the thermal distribution function for boson or fermion, respectively,
and E is ωn independent. Such factors appear in the ﬂow equation after the Matsubara summa-
tion. Because of the periodicity of exponential function, nB,F(E + iωn) equals to nB,F(E). However
if nB,F(E + ω) is substituted for nB,F(E + iωn), such a factor breaks the analyticity of the ﬂow
equation in the upper-half plane. Therefore nB,F(E + iωn) should be replaced by nB,F(E) before the
analytic continuation. By taking into account these points, the substitution ω + iǫ for iωn with ǫ
being a positive inﬁnitesimal gives the ﬂow equation for the inverse of the retarded Green’s func-

2.3 Numerical procedure

We employ the grid method to solve Eq. (10) numerically. This method reveals the global
structure of Uk(σ2) on discretized σ. We employ the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve Eq.
(10) and stop the ﬂow at k = kIR = 1MeV. It is known that certain conditions between the intervals
of discretization of variables must be fulﬁlled to solve partial diﬀerential equations numerically in a
stable way [63]. We have derived such conditions for Eq. (10), which are presented in Appendix B.
We ﬁx the intervals of discretization of σ and t in Eq. (10) according to these conditions. Although
ǫ, which appears after the analytic continuation, is deﬁned as a positive inﬁnitesimal, we set it to
1MeV in the present calculation, which should be small enough for the present purpose.

Three-dimensional momentum integrals remain after the Matsubara summation in Eq. (12).
However, the integrals can be fully calculated analytically for zero external momentum. Even for
a ﬁnite external momentum, they can be nicely reduced to one-dimensional integrals, which are
evaluated numerically. The numerical integrations involve some tricky point, and one has to take
care of the poles of each term in the integrands. For example, the ﬁrst and the third terms of the
integrand of the second integral in Eq. (A2) have the same pole ˜Eα = Eα + ip0. If such terms are

integrated separately, a large cancellation can occur, which then leads to big numerical errors.
Therefore, we ﬁrst combine such terms analytically in the integrand before numerical integrations.

3.1 Parameter setting

The truncated EAA Eq. (2) and the initial condition Eq. (26) have some parameters which are

those in [59] and list them in Table 1.

The chiral condensate σ0 is determined as σ which minimize Uk(σ2) − cσ and the constituent

3.2 Phase diagram and quark number susceptibility

We show the phase diagram in Fig. 2 where a contour map of the chiral condensate is also

given.

At the QCD critical point, the chiral susceptibility diverges. Therefore we locate the criti-
cal point by searching for the point where the sigma screening mass, the square of which is the
inverse of the chiral susceptibility, becomes the smallest. We also identify the ﬁrst order phase
transition by a discontinuity of the chiral condensate. The results at T = 5.0MeV, 5.1MeV and
5.2MeV are shown in Fig. 3 as functions of µ − µt(T ), where µt(T ) is the transition chemical
potentials for each temperature determined by the minimum point of the sigma curvature mass and
is found to be µt(5.0MeV) = 286.51702MeV, µt(5.1MeV) = 286.68600MeV and µt(5.2MeV) =
286.85320MeV.

We ﬁnd that the sigma screening mass becomes the smallest between T = 5.0MeV and
T = 5.2MeV and between µ = µt(5.0MeV) and µ = µt(5.2MeV). Therefore, the critical temper-
ature Tc and the critical chemical potential µc are estimated as Tc = 5.1 ± 0.1MeV and µc =

respectively. As seen in the behavior of the chiral condensate shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, the
phase transition along the chemical potential is of ﬁrst-order when T = 5.0MeV and of crossover
when T = 5.2MeV.

line is that of value 6.

It is known [51] that the quark-number susceptibility χq ≡ ∂ρq/∂µ is coupled to the scalar
susceptibility at ﬁnite µ and can be used to reveal the nature of the phase transition, where ρq
denotes the quark-number density. Indeed χq shows a singular behavior at the critical point, and
hence an enhancement of χq is a useful measure of the critical region. We thus calculate χq to map
out the critical region, as was done in [22, 52].

χq in the FRG formalism is calculated as follows. The eﬀective action Γ[ψ, ψ, σ, ~π] in the ﬁnite-
temperature formalism is related to the thermodynamic potential Ω as T Γ[0, 0, σ0, ~0] = Ω under
the assumption that the chiral condensate is homogeneous and h~πi = ~0, which in our case reads

3.3 Spectral function in the σ channel away from the critical point

Before entering the discussions on the spectral properties in the meson channel near the critical
point, we ﬁrst show the numerical result of the spectral function ρσ(ω, p) in the sigma channel
away from the critical point in the hadronic and QGP phases so that the peculiar behavior of the
spectral functions near the critical point shown in the next subsection shall be prominent.

Figures 5 (a) and 5(b) show ρσ(ω, p) at p ≡ |~p| = 50 MeV for (T = 50 MeV, µ = 0 MeV) and
(T = 50 MeV, µ = 400 MeV), respectively: The former (latter) is in the hadronic (QGP) phase. In
the former case, there is a sharp peak at ω = 290MeV and a relatively small bump in the space-like
region ω < p: They correspond to the sigma meson with a modiﬁed mass at ﬁnite temperature and
the phonon mode composed of particle-hole excitations, respectively, which is in accord with the
result in RPA in [46].

The spectral function also tells us the decay and absorption processes of the particle excitations
from the width of the corresponding peaks or bumps. In our energy scale, the following processes
contribute to the spectral function ρσ(ω, ~p):

σ∗ → σσ, σ∗ → ππ, σ∗ → ψψ, σ∗σ → σ, σ∗π → π, σ∗ψ → ψ,

where σ∗ denotes a virtual state in the sigma channel with energy-momentum (ω, ~p). The energy-
momentum conservation gives constraints on the posible (ω, ~p) region for the former three
processes as follows:

ω ≥ q~p2 + (2Mσ)2 for σ∗ → σσ,
ω ≥ q~p2 + (2Mπ)2 for σ∗ → ππ,
ω ≥ q~p2 + (2Mψ)2 for σ∗ → ψψ,

(31)

which are all in the time-like region. On the other hand, the latter three processes are all collisional
ones and possible only in the space-like region, 0 ≤ ω < p. In particular, the last process σ∗ψ → ψ
corresponds to the absorption process of the σ∗ mode into a thermaly excited quark. In short, the
width of the large bump at ω = 290MeV in Fig. 5(a) comes from the 2π decay process, while the
small bump arises from the space-like processes.

In the latter case, at T = 50MeV and µ = 400MeV, the peak position corresponding to the
sigma meson is shifted to ω = 210MeV, while the bump of the particle-hole excitations still
persists in the space-like region.

3.4 Spectral functions near the QCD critical point

We calculate the spectral function in the σ channel near the QCD critical point, by increas-
ing the chemical potential toward µc along constant temperature line T = Tc. The results at

momentum is set to p = 50MeV, and the space-like region (ω < p) is surrounded by the blue
lines. The positions of the thresholds for 2σ, 2π and ψψ decay channel determined by Eq. (31) are
denoted by s(cid:13), p(cid:13) and q(cid:13).

µ = 286.00MeV, µ = 286.50MeV and µ = 286.57MeV are shown in Fig. 6 (a). One can see the
sigma-mesonic peak as well as bumps corresponding to 2σ and 2π decay in the time-like region.
The peak position of the sigma-mesonic mode shifts to the lower energy as the system approaches
the critical point. The position of the 2σ threshold also shifts to a lower energy while those of
the 2π and ψψ thresholds hardly change. The spectral function in the space-like region is drasti-
cally enhanced as the system is close to the critical point. This behavior can be interpreted as the
softening of the particle-hole mode, which is in accordance with the result in [46]. In Fig. 6(b),
we show the results at chemical potentials much closer to the critical point. Because of numerical
instability in µ ≥ 286.60MeV, we choose µ = 286.58MeV and µ = 286.59MeV. For comparison,
the result at µ = 286.57MeV is also shown. These results are drastically diﬀerent from those in
µ ≤ 286.57MeV. In µ > 286.57MeV, the peak of the sigma-mesonic mode penetrates into the
space-like region and then merges into the particle-hole mode.

We can see the dispersion relations of the modes by making contour maps of the spectral
functions as functions of ω and p. Figure 7 shows the dispersion relations of the sigma meson
and particle-hole modes near the critical point. At µ = 286.3MeV, the sigma-mesonic peaks can
be seen in the time-like region as well as the particle-hole bump in the space-like region. As the
chemical potential increases, the dispersion relation of the sigma-mesonic mode shifts downward
and it touches the light cone near µ = 286.575MeV. At µ = 286.59MeV, in low-momentum region

for each chemical potential is denoted by s(cid:13). The 2π and ψψ decay thresholds hardly change and
are represented by p(cid:13) and q(cid:13).

the sigma-mesonic mode clearly penetrates into space-like region and merges to the particle-hole
bump, which has a ﬂat dispersion relation in the small momentum region. Our results indicate that
the sigma-mesonic mode as well as the particle-hole mode can become soft near the critical point.

One of the possible triggers of this phenomenon is the level repulsion between the sigma-
mesonic mode and other modes. In particular, the two sigma (σσ) mode is considered to play an
important role in the level repulsion since the threthold of the two sigma mode shifts downward
as the system approches the critical point. Let us suppose that each of the particle-hole mode, the

16

sigma-mesonic mode and the two sigma mode can be described by a state having single energy
level. Then the system can be regarded as a three level system as depicted in Fig. 8 (a): The
interaction within the three states leads to a level repulsion: If the interaction between the σ-
mesonic mode and the σσ state becomes suﬃciently strong as the system approaches the critical
point, the energy level of the sigma meson will be so strongly pushed down that it penetrates into
space-like region. To show that this scenario can be the case, we change the strength of the three
(0,3)
k,σσσ by hand to investigate the behavior of the sigma meson peak. The results in
point vertex Γ
(0,3)
k,σσσ by factors 0.8 and 1.02 are shown in Fig. 8 (b). The position of the
the cases of multiplying Γ
sigma meson goes up when the three point vertex is weakened, whereas it exhibits a downward
shift to a lower energy when the three point vertex is slightly enhanced. This result suggests that
the above interpretation in terms of a level repulsion can be correct.

Here it should be noted that our results exhibit a superluminal group velocity of the sigma-
mesonic mode near the critical point, as seen in Fig. 7 for p = 100 MeV at µ = 286.59 MeV.
Such an unphysical extreme behavior may be an artifact of our truncation scheme in which some
of higher-order terms in the derivative expansion, such as the wave-function renormalization and
so on, are neglected, although a drastic softening of the sigma mesonic mode may be true. Con-
versely speaking, such a drawback could disappear if one uses improved methods with higher
derivative terms being incorporated. One of the most important improvements is the inclusion of
wave-function renormalization since it may become important when additional modes emerge.
However, this task is beyond the scope of the present work and will be left as a future project.

17

So far, we have concentrated on the spectral function in the sigma channel and seen interesting
behaviors of it near the critical point. It would be intriguing to examine whether the spectral func-
tion ρπ(ω, p) in the pion channel shows any peculiar behavior near the critical point. The numerical
result of ρπ(ω, p) near the critical point is shown in Fig. 9, from which one can clearly see the dis-
persion relation of the pion mode in the time-like region but not in the space-like region. In contrast
to ρσ, ρπ hardly changes near the critical point. This result shows that there is no critical behavior
in the isovector modes.

4 Summary

We have calculated the spectral functions in the meson channels in the quark-meson model with
the functional renormalization group method based on the local potential approximation (LPA).
A partiicular emphasis is put on the behavior of the spectral function in the σ channel near the
QCD critical point. Our results show that the particle-hole mode (phonon) is enhanced near the
critical point, and thus imply that the density ﬂuctuations are the soft modes at the critical point, as
was suggested in RPA using the NJL model [46]. In addition, we have found that the low-energy
dispersion curve of the sigma meson penetrates into the space-like region and the mode merges
into the particle-hole mode near the critical point. This result may imply that the sigma meson also
acts as a soft mode at the QCD critical point. We have also suggested that a possible level repulsion
between the sigma meson and the two-sigma state leads to the anomalous softening of the sigma
(0,3)
k,σσσ strongly aﬀects the
meson: An artiﬁcial variation of the strength of the σ three-point vertex Γ
position of the sigma meson. We have also investigated the spectral function in the pion channel
near the critical point, which shows no softening not only in the time-like but also in the space-like
regions, in contrast to the isoscalar modes.

Since our result might provide a new picture in which the critical dynamics at the QCD critical
point can be described by an eﬀective theory composed of not only the hydrodynamical modes
including the density ﬂuctuation but also the sigma meson mode, there might be some implications
for the dynamical class of the QCD critical point [20, 47, 64].

In recent years, the possible existence of inhomogeneous chiral phases in dense quark matter
are intensively examined [65–68]. It is interesting to investigate in the FRG how the existence of the
inhomogeneous phases aﬀects the behavior of low-energy modes including the Nambu-Goldstone
modes. It is also worth emphasizing that our analysis of the spectral functions in the space-like
region or particle-hole modes can be extended to that of precursors of such inhomogeneous phases:
our results showing the softening and non-softening of the particle-hole modes in the sigma and
the pion channels might imply that the inhomogeneous phase with pion condensate does not come
to existence as a result of a second-order transition.

18

Our calculation is based on the local potential approximation in which some of higher-order
terms in the derivative expansion are neglected. Such a simple truncation scheme might be an
origin of a superluminal group velocity in the close vicinity of the critical point encountered in
Section 3: Thus, it should be imperative to conﬁrm the results by employing improved methods
incorporating higher derivative terms including the wave-function renormalization since it should
be important when composite collective modes emerge. This intiguing task will be, however, left
as a future project.

B Numerical stability conditions for solving the ﬂow equation of the eﬀective

potential

In general when one solves a partial diﬀerential equation numerically, the discretization of
derivatives may cause numerical errors. Thus, one needs to impose numerical stability conditions
to avoid the enhancement of the error due to accumulation. The derivation of such conditions is
concretely demonstrated in the case of linear partial diﬀerential equations and brieﬂy mentioned
in the case of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations in [63]. In this appendix, based on [63] we
consider the numerical stability conditions for a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation which is a

21

generalized equation of Eq. (10) to derive the numerical stability conditions for solving Eq. (10) in
the grid method.

Consider a nonlinear partial diﬀerential equation for some function u(t, σ) of the following

form:

∂u(t, σ)

∂t

= f  t, σ, u(t, σ),

∂u(t, σ)

∂σ

,

∂2u(t, σ)

∂σ2

! .

where f is an arbitrary real function. This equation is a generalized equation of Eq. (10). We derive
the numerical stability conditions to this equation in the case of forward diﬀerence for t-derivative
and central three-point diﬀerence for σ-derivative. We expect the derived conditions can be also
applied to the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method we use in the practical calculations. Then the
discretized ﬂow equation is

(B1)

u(t + ∆t, σ) − u(t, σ)

where ∆t and ∆σ are intervals of discretization of t and σ. We suppose that some numerical error
occurs at some step of numerical calculation, i.e. suppose the numerical solution u(t, σ) becomes
as following,

u(t, σ) = u0(t, σ) + δu(t, σ),

(B3)

where u0(t, σ) is the exact solution of Eq. (B2) and δu(t, σ) is the deviation from the exact solution
caused by numerical error. We substitute Eq. (B3) into Eq. (B2) and get the evolution equation
for δu(t, σ) with considering ﬁrst order of expansion with δu(t, σ) and using the fact that u0(t, σ)
exactly satisﬁes Eq. (B2):

For simplicity, we ignore the σ dependence of F and G. Then the solutions of Eq. (B4) can be
written by linear combinations of Fourier components,

δu(m∆t, n∆σ; k) = ξk(m∆t)eikn∆σ.

(B5)

where we substitute m∆t and n∆σ for t and σ (m, n ∈ Z). By substituting Eq. (B5) into Eq. (B4),
we get the following equation after some deformation;

(B6)

If |ξk((m + 1)∆t)/ξk(m∆t)| > 1, the numerical deviation is ampliﬁed as m increases (the ﬂow step
goes forward) and numerical instability occurs. Therefore the condition for stable calculation is

From Eq. (B6), this condition can be rewritten as

ξk((m + 1)∆t)

ξk(m∆t)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

h(X) ≤ 1 (−1 ≤ X ≤ 1),

With considering that h(X) satisﬁes h(1) = 1, one can easily understand that the condition Eq. (B8)
is equivalent to the following conditions;

(X = 1) ≥ 0,

h(−1) ≤ 1.

These conditions are rewritten as following;

2(a2 − b2) + 2a(1 − a) ≥ 0,
a2 − b2 − 2a(1 − a) + (1 − a)2 + b2 ≤ 1.

(B11)
We show later that G < 0 and ∆t < 0 in the case of Eq. (10). Supposing G < 0 and ∆t < 0, Eq.
(B11) is ﬁnally rewritten as

G is negative deﬁnite, and ∆t is also negative because the direction of ﬂow is from k = Λ to k = 0.

Although above discussion contains rough approximations, numerical instability can be
avoided with adjusting ∆t and ∆σ so that Eq. (B12) is satisﬁed. Because the above condition
of Eq. (B12) is too strict when σ is close to zero, we neglect the condition around σ = 0.
