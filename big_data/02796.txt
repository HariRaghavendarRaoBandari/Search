CROSS-CONNECTIONS OF THE TRANSFORMATION

SEMIGROUP

AZEEF MUHAMMED P A AND A R RAJAN

Abstract. Cross-connection is a construction of regular semigroups using
certain categories called normal categories which are abstractions of the prin-
cipal left(right) ideals of the semigroup. In this paper, we describe the cross-
connections in the transformation semigroup TX which is the semigroup of
all non-invertible transformations on a set X. The categories involved are
characterized as the powerset category P(X) and the category of partitions
Π(X); and they are shown to be mutual normal duals. We describe these
categories, all the cross-connections between them and construct the regular
semigroups that arise from the cross-connections. We show that each of the
cross-connection semigroups arising is isomorphic to TX . This will provide an
alternate way of studying the structure of TX and also shed light into the more
general theory of cross-connections.

1. Introduction

In the development of the structure theory of regular semigroups, there are
mainly two approaches. The ﬁrst approach inspired by the work of W D Munn
(cf. [8]) for inverse semigroups uses the set of idempotents E of the semigroup
to construct the semigroup as a full-subsemigroup of the semigroup of principal-
ideal isomorphisms of E. In this context, K S S Nambooripad (cf. [9]) abstractly
characterized the set of idempotents of a (regular) semigroup as a (regular) biordered
set and it was later proved by D Easdown (cf. [2]) that infact the idempotents of
any semigroup form a biordered set.

The second approach initiated by T E Hall (cf. [5]) uses the ideals of the reg-
ular semigroup to analyse its structure. P A Grillet (cf. [4]) reﬁned Hall’s theory
to abstractly characterize the set of ideals as regular partially ordered sets and
constructed the fundamental image of the regular semigroup as a cross-connection
semigroup. Again Nambooripad (cf. [10]) generalized the idea to arbitrary regu-
lar semigroups by characterizing the set of ideals with appropriate morphisms as
normal categories. A cross-connection between two normal categories determines
a cross-connection semigroup and conversely every regular semigroup is isomorphic
to a cross-connection semigroup for a suitable cross-connection.

A normal category is a categorical abstraction of the class of principal left(right)
ideals of a regular semigroup. For a regular semigroup S, the objects of the normal
category of principal left(right) ideals are Se (eS) for e ∈ E(S). The morphisms
are partial right(left) translations. A normal category C is axiomatized as a small
category with subobjects such that each morphism in C has a special kind of factor-
ization called normal factorization and each c ∈ vC has an associated idempotent
normal cone. A normal cone in C is essentially a nice collection of morphisms in C
associated with a distinguished vertex d ∈ vC. All the normal cones in a normal cat-
egory with a special binary composition form a regular semigroup T C known as the
semigroup of normal cones in C. A cross-connection between two normal categories
C and D is a local isomorphism Γ : D → N ∗C where N ∗C is the normal dual of the
category C. The normal dual N ∗C is a full subcategory of the category of all functors
from C to Set. The objects of N ∗C are functors called H−functors and morphisms
are natural transformations. And given the cross-connection Γ : D → N ∗C, we have
a dual cross-connection ∆ : C → N ∗D such that there is a natural isomorphism χΓ
between the bi-functors Γ(−, −) and ∆(−, −) associated with Γ and ∆. Using the
natural isomorphism χΓ, we can get a linking of some normal cones γ ∈ T C with
δ ∈ T D. And the pairs of linked cones (γ, δ) will form a regular semigroup which is
called the cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓ determined by Γ. Then ˜SΓ is isomorphic
to S; and this gives a faithful representation of the semigroup S as a sub-direct
product of T C × (T D)op.

The transformation semigroup TX is the semigroup of all non-invertible trans-
formations on an arbitrary set X. It is known that TX is a regular sub-semigroup of
the full transformation semigroup TX which is the semigroup of all transformations
on a set X. TX is very important in semigroup theory because of the analogue of
Cayley’s theorem of group theory which says every semigroup can be realized as a
transformation semigroup(cf. [6]). Consequently TX and its sub-semigroups have
been studied extensively (cf. [3], [11]).

In this paper, we describe the general theory of cross-connections in the trans-
formation semigroup. In the process, we identify the normal categories involved
in the construction, their normal duals, some intermediary semigroups that arise,
some cross-connections between the normal categories and also the semigroups that
arise from the cross-connections.

The normal categories arising from the transformation semigroup TX are char-
acterized as the powerset category and the category of partitions. The powerset
category P(X) associated with X is the category whose objects are proper subsets
of X and morphisms are mappings. The category of partitions Π(X) of the set X is
a category with object set vΠ(X) = { ¯π : π is a non-identity partition of X} where
¯π is the set of all functions from π to X. A morphism from ¯π1 to ¯π2 is given by Pη
for some η : π2 → π1 such that (α)Pη = ηα for every α ∈ ¯π1. We show that the
normal dual N ∗P(X) of P(X) is isomorphic to Π(X) and N ∗Π(X) is isomorphic
to P(X). We study some cross-connections between the powerset category and
the partition category and construct the right reductive subsemigroups of TX as
cross-connection semigroups. We describe how each permutation on the set X gives
rise to a cross-connection. We also prove that all the cross-connection semigroups
that arise from these categories are in fact induced by a permutation on X.

2. Powerset category and the category of partitions

Let X be a non-empty set and inorder to avoid trivialities, assume that X has
atleast two elements. The transformation semigroup TX on X is the semigroup of
all non-invertible transformations on X. In this paper, all the functions are written
in the order of their composition .ie from left to right; and for a small category C,
the set of objects of C is denoted by vC and the set of morphisms by C itself.

Now given the set X, we can construct a very simple category P(X) from X
with the object set as the set of all proper subsets of X. And given any two subsets
A, B; a morphism from A to B is a function f from A to B. We will call P(X) the
powerset category and it has a natural choice of subobjects- the one provided by set
inclusions. Here, the composition of two morphisms is function composition and
inclusion morphisms are inclusion functions .i.e we have an inclusion j = j(A, B) :
A → B if A ⊆ B. A function q : B → A is called a retraction if A ⊆ B and
j(A, B)q = 1A.

Now given any function f from A to B, it has a special factorization of the
form f = quj where q : A → A′ is a retraction, u : A′ → B′ is an isomorphism(.ie
bijection) and j = j(B′, B) is an inclusion where B′ = Im f and A′ is a cross-section
of the partition πf of A determined by f . Note that πf = {f −1(b) : b ∈ B′}. Such
a factorization is called a normal factorization and qu is called the epimorphic
component f ◦ of f .

Now given any D ⊆ X, we associate a function σ : vP(X) → P(X) with the
following properties. For each subset A of X, σ(A) : A → D and whenever A ⊆ B,
j(A, B)σ(B) = σ(A). Further for some subset C of X, σ(C) : C → D is a bijection.
Such a collection of morphisms {σ(A) : A ∈ vP(X)} is called a normal cone σ
with vertex D in the category P(X). In addition if σ(D) = 1D, then σ is known
as an idempotent normal cone.
Let u : X → D be a transformation such that u(x) = x ∀x ∈ D. For any A ⊆ X,
deﬁne

σ(A) = u|A : A → D.

Then σ is an idempotent normal cone since σ(D) = 1D. So P(X) is a small cate-
gory with subobjects such that each morphism in P(X) has a normal factorization
and each D ∈ vP(X) has an associated idempotent normal cone; and hence P(X)
is a normal category.
Now suppose γ, δ are two normal cones in P(X) with vertices C and D respectively,
we can compose them as follows. For any A ∈ vP(X),
(γ ∗ δ)(A) = γ(A)(δ(C))◦

(1)

where (δ(C))◦ is the epimorphic component of the morphism δ(C). Then it can
be seen that γ ∗ δ is a normal cone with vertex D. The set of all normal cones
in P(X) under the binary operation deﬁned in equation (1) forms a regular semi-
group T P(X) called the semigroup of normal cones in P(X).
It can be shown that every normal cone σ in P(X) with vertex A deﬁnes a trans-
formation a : X → A as follows.

(2)

(x)a = (x)σ({x}) for all x ∈ X

where σ({x}) is the component of σ at the singleton {x} ∈ vP(X); and conversely
every normal cone in P(X) is determined by a transformation a : X → A (cf. [12]).
If we denote the normal cone generated by a transformation a as ρa; then we can

4

AZEEF MUHAMMED P A AND A R RAJAN

show that φ : TX → T P(X) : a 7→ ρa is a semigroup homomorphism. Such a
homomorphism always exists between a regular semigroup S and T C where C is
the normal category associated with S(cf. [10], Theorem 16). Although in general,
φ need not be injective or onto; in the case of TX , we can show that φ is indeed a
bijection. Summarising, we have the following.

Theorem 1. (cf. [12]) P(X) is a normal category and T P(X) is isomorphic to
TX.

Remark 2. Observe that T P(X) is a representation of the semigroup TX; wherein
an element in TX is represented as a normal cone in P(X), which is nothing but
a generalization of normal mapping of Grillet (cf. [4]).

Now using the category P(X), we construct a new category N ∗P(X) called
the normal dual of P(X). The objects of N ∗P(X) are certain set-valued functors
called H−functors. For an idempotent transformation e ∈ TX , deﬁne a H−functor
H(e; −) : P(X) → Set as follows. For each A ∈ vP(X) and for each g : A → B
in P(X),

(3a)

(3b)

H(e; A) ={ef : f : Im e → A} and

H(e; g) : H(e; A) → H(e; B) given by ef 7→ ef g.

It may be observed here that in general for a normal category C, the H−functor
is deﬁned as H(γ; −) for an arbitrary normal cone γ ∈ C. But since we have
the correspondence of normal cones and transformations in P(X), the deﬁnition
simpliﬁes.

Lemma 3. (cf. [13]) Let e ∈ TX and A ⊆ X. Then

H(e; A) = {a ∈ TX : πa ⊇ πe and Im a ⊆ A}

and if g : A → B then H(e; g) : H(e; A) → H(e; B) is given by a 7→ ag.

Thus the H-functor H(e; −) is completely determined by the partition of e. The
morphisms in N ∗P(X) which are natural transformations between the functors
are characterized as follows.

Lemma 4. (cf. [13]) Let σ : H(e; −) → H(f ; −) be a morphism in N ∗P(X).
Then there exists a unique v ∈ f (TX)e such that the component of the natural
transformation σ(C) : H(e; C) → H(f ; C) is given by a 7→ va where a ∈ H(e; C)
so that πa ⊇ πe and Im a ⊆ C.

The above discussion regarding the normal dual of P(X) inspires us to deﬁne
a category of partitions of X as follows. A partition π of X is a family of subsets

Ai of X such that S Ai = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ for i 6= j. A partition is said to

be non-identity if atleast one Ai has more than one element. Given a non-identity
partition π of X, we denote by ¯π the set of all functions from π to X. Let π1, π2
be partitions of X and let η be a function from π2 to π1. We deﬁne Pη : ¯π1 to ¯π2
by (α)Pη = ηα for every α ∈ ¯π1. Now the category of partitions Π(X) of the set X
has vertex set

vΠ(X) = { ¯π : π is a non-identity partition of X}

and a morphism in Π(X) from ¯π1 to ¯π2 is given by Pη for η : π2 → π1 as deﬁned
above.

If π1 = {Ai : i ∈ I} and π2 = {Bj : j ∈ J}, deﬁne a partial order on Π(X) as

¯π1 ≤ ¯π2 if and only if π2 ≤ π1; where

π2 ≤ π1 if and only if for each j, Bj ⊆ Ai for some i.

If π2 ≤ π1, then the map ν : Bj 7→ Ai is the inclusion map from π2 → π1 and
Pν : ¯π1 → ¯π2 is a morphism in Π(X). We consider Pν as the inclusion morphism
from ¯π1 to ¯π2.

Also if ¯π1 ≤ ¯π2 and Pν = j( ¯π1, ¯π2) : ¯π1 → ¯π2 is the inclusion morphism, there
exists a retraction Pζ : ¯π2 → ¯π1 .ie j( ¯π1, ¯π2)Pζ = 1 ¯π1. Note that in this case,
ζ : π1 → π2 is deﬁned by (Ai)ζ = Bj where Bj ∈ π2 is chosen such that Bj ⊆ Ai.
Now if we deﬁne P as the subcategory of Π(X) with vP = vΠ(X) and morphisms
as inclusion morphisms Pν, then we can verify that (Π(X), P) forms a category with
subobjects. The next theorem gives a normal factorization of a morphism in Π(X).

Theorem 5. Let Pη be a morphism from ¯π1 to ¯π2 in Π(X) with η : π2 → π1. Then
there exists partitions πσ and πγ; and ν : π2 → πσ, u : πσ → πγ and ζ : πγ → π1
such that Pη = PζPuPν such that Pζ is a retraction, Pu is an isomorphism and Pν
is an inclusion in Π(X).

Proof. Let ση be the equivalence relation on X deﬁned as follows. For each partition
π = {Ck : k ∈ K} and x ∈ X, we denote by [x] = [xπ] the set Ck ∈ π such that
x ∈ Ck. That is [x] is the equivalence class of π considering π as an equivalence
relation. Deﬁne σ = ση by:

σ = {(x, y) : [x]η = [y]η}

where [x], [y] ∈ π2. Then as equivalence relations π2 ⊆ σ. Let ν : π2 → σ be the
inclusion given by [x] 7→ [xσ] where [x] is the equivalence class containing x in π2
and [xσ] is the equivalence class containing x in σ. Since ν : π2 → σ is the inclusion
map, we see that Pν : ¯σ → ¯π2 is the inclusion morphism.
Let γ = γη be the partition of X deﬁned as follows. Let π1 = {Ai : i ∈ I}. Then
Im η = {Ai : i ∈ I ′} for some I ′ ⊆ I. Then ﬁx an element 1 ∈ I ′ and deﬁne
γ = {B ∪ A1} ∪ {Ai : i ∈ I ′ \ {1}} where B = ∪{Aj : Aj /∈ Im η}. Then clearly γ
is a partition of X and π1 ⊆ γ.
Let ζ : γ → π1 be deﬁned as follows.

B ∪ A1 7→ A1

Aj 7→ Aj for j ∈ I ′ \ {1}

Then we see that Pζ is a retraction from ¯π1 to ¯γ. Now deﬁne u : σ → γ as follows.

u([xσ]) =([x]η

B ∪ A1

if [x]η 6= A1
if [x]η = A1

where [x] is the equivalence class of π2 containing x. Clearly u is well-deﬁned and
is a bijection. And since u is a bijection, Pu : ¯γ → ¯σ is also a bijection and so is an
isomorphism in Π(X).
Now to show that Pη = Pζ PuPν , consider any [x] ∈ π2; then

([x])νuζ = ([xσ])uζ = ([x]η)ζ = [x]η.

And hence for any α ∈ ¯π1, (α)Pη = (α)Pνuζ = νuζα = (α)Pζ PuPν . And so
Pη = PζPuPν and hence every morphism in Π(X) has a normal factorization. (cid:3)

6

AZEEF MUHAMMED P A AND A R RAJAN

Also let π = {Ai : i ∈ I} be a partition of X such that π = πe for an idempotent
e : X → X. For each partition πα = {Bj : j ∈ J}, deﬁne eα : π → πα by Ai 7→ Bj
such that (Ai)e ∈ Bj. Then a cone ¯e deﬁned by

¯e( ¯πα) = Peα for all ¯πα ∈ Π(X)

is an idempotent normal cone in Π(X) with vertex ¯π; and hence Π(X) is a normal
category(cf. [13]).

Theorem 6. The semigroup T Π(X) of all normal cones in Π(X) is anti-isomorphic
to the transformation semigroup TX .

Proof. Observe that given any transformation a ∈ TX, we have a cone σa in Π(X)
as follows. Deﬁne

σa( ¯πα) = Paα for all ¯πα ∈ vΠ(X).

Then aα|Ima : Im a → Im α will give a map ηaα : πa → πα. And Paα will be a
morphism from ¯πα to ¯πa for all ¯πα ∈ vΠ(X).
So σa is a normal cone in Π(X) with vertex ¯πa. Also σa.σb = σba. Hence σa 7→ a
is an anti-isomorphism and so the semigroup T Π(X) of all normal cones in Π(X)
is anti-isomorphic to TX .

(cid:3)

3. Cross-connections

Now we can deﬁne functors P : N ∗P(X) → Π(X) and Q : Π(X) → N ∗P(X)

as follows. For H(e; −) ∈ vN ∗P(X) and σ : H(e; −) → H(f ; −),

(4)

P (H(e; −)) = ¯πe

and P (σ) = Pv

where πe is the partition of X induced by the transformation e and v given as
follows. By Lemma 4, σ induces a unique map v : Im f → Im e. Now Pv : ¯πe → ¯πf
is determined by the map ηv : πf → πe induced by v on πf . Further Q is deﬁned
by

(5)

Q(¯π) = H(e; −) and Q(Pη) = σ

where e is an idempotent mapping such that πe = π. And for η : πf → πe,
σ : H(e; −) → H(f ; −) is deﬁned by a 7→ va where v : Im f → Im e is determined
uniquely by η.

Theorem 7. (cf. [13]) The normal dual N ∗P(X) is isomorphic to the category of
partitions Π(X) and N ∗Π(X) is isomorphic to the powerset category P(X).

Proof. P Q will be a functor from N ∗P(X) to itself such that P Q = 1N ∗P(X).
Similarly QP will be a functor from Π(X) to itself such that QP = 1Π(X).
And since P is an order isomorphism preserving the inclusions, N ∗P(X) is iso-
morphic to Π(X) as normal categories.
By duality, we can characterize the normal dual N ∗Π(X) of the partition cate-
gory. Each cone in Π(X) can be realized using a transformation a ∈ TX and the
H-functor H(e; −) ∈ vN ∗Π(X) can be seen as completely characterized by Im e.
Corresponding to σ : H(e; −) → H(f ; −) in N ∗Π(X), we have a unique morphism
Pη : ¯πf → ¯πe in Π(X) and Pη will determine a map η = ηv : πe → πf ; which in

CROSS-CONNECTIONS OF THE TRANSFORMATION SEMIGROUP

turn gives a unique map v :
R : N ∗Π(X) → P(X) as follows.

Im e → Im f . And hence we can deﬁne a functor

(6)

R(H(e; −)) = Im e

and R(σ) = v

We can show that R is an inclusion preserving covariant functor which is an order
isomorphism, v-injective, v-surjective and fully-faithful. And hence N ∗Π(X) is
isomorphic to the powerset category P(X).
(cid:3)

We describe the M-set associated with a cone σ in P(X) as

M σ = {c ∈ P(X) | σ(c) is an isomorphism}.

In the next lemma, we identify it with a cross-section of a partition. Given a
partition π on a set X, a subset Y of X is called a cross-section provided that Y
contains exactly one representative from each equivalence class.

Lemma 8. Let σ be a normal cone in P(X). Then M σ = {A ⊆ X : A is a
cross-section of πα} where σ = ρα for some α ∈ TX and πα is the partition of α.

Proof. If σ = ρα is a cone in P(X), then since M ρα = {Se : e ∈ E(Rα)} (cf. [10]),
M σ = {Sβ : β ∈ E(Rα)}. Hence M σ = {Sβ : πβ = πα and β2 = β} = {A : A
is a cross-section of πα = π}.
(cid:3)

Thus, given σ ∈ E(T P(X)), we have a natural identiﬁcation of the hom-functor

H(σ; −) with a partition π; and henceforth we write M (π) for M H(σ; −) = M σ.

Deﬁnition 1. (cf. [10]) Let C be a small category with subobjects. Then an ideal
hci of C is the full subcategory of C whose objects are subobjects of c in C. It is
called the principal ideal generated by c.

Deﬁnition 2. (cf. [10]) Let C and D be normal categories. Then a functor F :
C → D is said to be a local isomorphism if F is inclusion preserving, fully faithful
and for each c ∈ vC, F|hci is an isomorphism of the ideal hci onto hF (c)i.

Deﬁnition 3. (cf. [10]) Let C and D be normal categories. A cross-connection
from D to C is a triplet (D, C; Γ) where Γ : D → N ∗C is a local isomorphism such
that for every c ∈ vC, there is some d ∈ vD such that c ∈ M Γ(d).

Since N ∗P(X) is isomorphic to Π(X)(by Theorem 7), the local isomorphism
Γ : Π(X) → N ∗P(X) of a cross-connection from Π(X) to P(X) can be taken as
a local isomorphism Γ : Π(X) → Π(X). And using Lemma 8, (Π(X), P(X), Γ) is
a cross-connection if Γ : Π(X) → Π(X) is a local isomorphism such that for every
A ∈ vP(X), there is some ¯π ∈ vΠ(X) such that A is a cross-section of Γ(¯π).

Now given a cross-connection Γ : Π(X) → Π(X) ∼= N ∗P(X), we deﬁne a bi-
functor Γ : P(X) × Π(X) → Set as follows. For all (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vΠ(X) and
(f, Pv) : (A, ¯π) → (B, ¯π′)

(7a)

(7b)

Γ(A, ¯π) = {α ∈ TX : Im α ⊆ A and ¯πα ⊆ Γ(¯π)}
Γ(f, Pv) : α 7→ (uα)f = u(αf )

where Pu = Γ(Pv).
And for the dual cross-connection ∆ : P(X) → P(X) ∼= N ∗Π(X) associated

8

AZEEF MUHAMMED P A AND A R RAJAN

with Γ, we deﬁne a bi-functor ∆ : P(X) × Π(X) → Set as follows. For all
(A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vΠ(X) and (f, Pv) : (A, ¯π) → (B, ¯π′)
(8a)

∆(A, ¯π) = {α ∈ TX : Im α ⊆ ∆(A) and ¯πα ⊆ ¯π}
∆(f, Pv) : α 7→ (vα)g = v(αg)

(8b)

where g = ∆(f ).

3.1. Cross-connections induced by permutations on X. Recall that a per-
mutation on a set X is an injective map from X onto itself. In this section, we
show that given a permutation θ on X, we can deﬁne a cross-connection from the
powerset category P(X) to the partition category Π(X) induced by θ. First we see
that a permutation θ induces an isomorphism θP on the powerset category P(X).

Proposition 9. Let θ be a permutation on the set X. Deﬁne a functor θP :
P(X) → P(X) as follows. For a subset A of X, deﬁne θP : A 7→ θ(A) and for
f : A → B in P(X), deﬁne θP(f ) = θ(f ) = θ−1f θ : θ(A) → θ(B). Then θP is a
normal category isomorphism on P(X).

Proof. Clearly for A ∈ P(X), θP(A) = θ(A) ∈ P(X). Since θ is injective, θP
is injective. And θP is onto, since θ is onto. Hence θP : vP(X) → vP(X) is a
bijection on vP(X). Now given f : A → B in P(X), θ−1f θ is a map θ(f ) from
θ(A) to θ(B).
Also if f : A → B and g : B → C, then θ(f ◦ g) = θ−1(f ◦ g)θ = θ−1f (θθ−1)gθ =
(θ−1f θ)(θ−1gθ) = θ(f ) ◦ θ(g). Hence θ is a covariant functor on P(X).
Also given g : θ(A) → θ(B), we see that θgθ−1 is a map from A → B; and
θ(θgθ−1) = θ−1θgθ−1θ = g; and hence θ is full. Also if θ−1f θ = θ−1gθ, then f = g
and so θ is faithful.
Now A ⊆ B if and only if θ(A) ⊆ θ(B). Also θ(j(A, B)) = j(θ(A), θ(B)). Thus θP
is a normal category isomorphism on P(X).
(cid:3)

When there is no ambiguity regarding notations, we shall denote θP by θ itself as
above. Now we see that a permutation θ induces an isomorphism θ¯π on the partition
category Π(X) of X. For that we need the following lemma which describes a
permutation θπ on the set of partitions of X.

Lemma 10. Let θ be a permutation on the set X and σ = {Ai : i ∈ I} be a
partition of X. Then θπ(σ) = θ(σ) deﬁned as follows is also a partition of X.

(9)

θ(σ) = {θ(Ai) : i ∈ I}

Now using θπ, we can get an isomorphism of the category of partitions Π(X).

Proposition 11. Let θ be a permutation on the set X. Deﬁne a functor θ¯π :
Π(X) → Π(X) as follows. For ¯σ ∈ vΠ(X), θ¯π(¯σ) = θ(¯σ) = P(θ−1)π (¯σ) and for
Pη : ¯σ1 → ¯σ2 in Π(X), θ¯π(Pη) = θ(Pη) = θ−1Pηθ. Then θ¯π is a normal category
isomorphism on Π(X).

Proof. Since (θ−1)π is a mapping from θ(σ) → σ by the above lemma, P(θ−1)π is a
morphism in Π(X) from σ to θ(σ) such that P(θ−1)π : α 7→ (θ−1)πα for all α ∈ ¯σ.
Since θ−1 is injective and onto, so is (θ−1)π. And hence θ¯π is a bijection on vΠ(X)
such that σ 7→ θ(σ). Now θ¯π being a bijection can be inverted and hence given
Pη : ¯σ1 → ¯σ2 in Π(X), we see that θ−1
¯π Pηθ¯π = θ−1Pηθ gives a map from θ( ¯σ1) to
θ( ¯σ2) with the corresponding mapping θ(η) = θ−1ηθ from the partition θ(σ2) to

θ(σ1).
Also if Pη : ¯σ1 → ¯σ2 and Pµ : ¯σ2 → ¯σ3, then θ(Pη ◦ Pµ) = θ−1(Pη ◦ Pµ)θ =
θ−1Pη(θθ−1)Pµθ = (θ−1Pηθ)(θ−1Pµθ) = θ(Pη) ◦ θ(Pµ). Hence θ¯π is a covariant
functor on Π(X).
Also given Pµ : θ( ¯σ1) → θ( ¯σ2), then θ¯πPµθ−1
¯π = θPµθ−1 is a map from ¯σ1 → ¯σ2;
and hence θ¯π is full. Also if θ−1Pηθ = θ−1Pµθ, then Pη = Pµ and so θ¯π is faithful.
Now ¯σ1 ⊆ ¯σ2 if and only if σ1 ⊇ σ2 if and only if θ(σ1) ⊇ θ(σ2) if and only if
θ( ¯σ1) ⊆ θ( ¯σ2). Also θ(j( ¯σ1, ¯σ2)) = j(θ( ¯σ1), θ( ¯σ2)). Thus θ¯π is a normal category
isomorphism on Π(X).
(cid:3)

Observe that as used above, when there is no ambiguity regarding notations, we

shall denote θ¯π by θ itself; and θ¯π(π) shall be denoted by θ(¯π).

Lemma 12. Let θ be a permutation of X. Then (Π(X), P(X); Γθ) is a cross-
connection where Γθ : Π(X) → Π(X) such that

(10)

Γθ(¯π) = θ(¯π) and Γθ(Pη) = θ(Pη)

Proof. From the discussion at the beginning of section 3.2, (Π(X), P(X); Γθ) is a
cross-connection if Γθ : Π(X) → Π(X) is a local isomorphism such that for every
A ∈ vP(X), there is some ¯π ∈ vΠ(X) such that A ∈ M θ(¯π). Since by Proposition
11, Γθ is a normal category isomorphism of Π(X), Γθ is inclusion preserving, fully
faithful and for each ¯π ∈ vΠ(X), F|h¯πi is an isomorphism of the ideal h¯πi onto
hΓθ(¯π)i. Also since image of Γθ is full, for every A ∈ vP(X), there is some
¯π ∈ vΠ(X) such that A ∈ M θ(¯π). Hence Γθ is a cross-connection.
(cid:3)

As above, it is straight forward to show the following.

Lemma 13. Let θ be a permutation of X and ∆θ−1 : P(X) → P(X) be a functor such that

(11)

∆θ−1(A) = θ−1(A) and ∆θ−1(f ) = θ−1(f )

Then (P(X), Π(X); ∆θ−1) is a cross-connection.

Proposition 14. Let (Π(X), P(X); Γθ) and (P(X), Π(X); ∆θ−1) be two cross-
connections with associated bi-functors Γθ(−, −) and ∆θ−1(−, −) respectively, then
there is a natural isomorphism χΓθ : Γθ(−, −) → ∆θ−1(−, −) deﬁned as

χΓθ (A, ¯π) : α 7→ θαθ−1.

Hence ∆θ−1 is the dual of Γθ and χΓθ is the duality associated with the cross-
connection.

Proof. Firstly for α ∈ Γθ(A, ¯π), the map θαθ−1 ∈ ∆θ−1(A, ¯π). To see that, observe
since Im α ⊆ A, Im θα ⊆ A and so Im θαθ−1 ⊆ θ−1(A) (as θ−1 : A 7→ θ−1(A)).
Similarly since ¯πα ⊆ θ(¯π) and θ(¯π) = P(θ−1)π (¯π), we have θ−1(π) ⊆ πα. Since πα ⊆
παθ−1, we have θ−1(π) ⊆ παθ−1 .ie θθ−1(π) ⊆ θ(παθ−1 ). Now since θθ−1(π) = π
and θ(παθ−1 ) = πθαθ−1, we have π ⊆ πθαθ−1. And hence πθαθ−1 ⊆ π. Thus the
map θαθ−1 ∈ ∆θ−1(A, ¯π) whenever α ∈ Γθ(A, ¯π).
Also observe that since the conjugation map α 7→ θαθ−1 is a bijection, the map
χΓθ (A, ¯π) is a bijection of the set Γθ(A, ¯π) onto the set ∆θ−1(A, ¯π).
Now to show that χΓθ is a natural isomorphism, let (f, Pη) ∈ P(X) × Π(X) with

10

AZEEF MUHAMMED P A AND A R RAJAN

f : A → B and Pη : ¯π1 → ¯π2. Then for α ∈ Γθ(A, ¯π1),

(α)χΓθ (A, ¯π1)∆θ−1 (f, Pη) = (θαθ−1)∆θ−1(f, Pη)

= η(θαθ−1)θ−1(f )(using equation (8))
= ηθαθ−1θf θ−1(using Proposition 9)
= ηθαf θ−1.

Also (α)Γθ(f, Pη)χΓθ (B, ¯π2) = (θ(η)αf )χΓθ (B, ¯π2)(using equation (7))

= θ(θ(η)αf )θ−1
= θθ−1ηθαf θ−1(using Proposition 11)
= ηθαf θ−1.

Thus we have

(α)χΓθ (A, ¯π1)∆θ−1(f, Pη) = (α)Γθ(f, Pη)χΓθ (B, ¯π2) ∀ α ∈ Γθ(A, ¯π1)

and so χΓθ is a natural isomorphism.
Hence χΓθ is the duality associated with Γθ and by [10], ∆θ−1 is the dual cross-
connection of Γθ.
(cid:3)

Lemma 15. Given a cross-connection (Π(X), P(X); Γθ) with a dual cross-connection
(P(X), Π(X); ∆θ−1),

U Γθ = [{α ∈ TX : Im α ⊆ A and ¯πα ⊆ θ(¯π) : (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vΠ(X)}; and
U ∆θ−1 = [{β ∈ TX : Im β ⊆ θ−1(A) and ¯πβ ⊆ ¯π : (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vΠ(X)}.

Observe here that since (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X)×vΠ(X), U Γθ = TX and U ∆θ−1 = T op
X .

Then we can verify the following lemma.

Lemma 16. Let (Π(X), P(X); Γθ) be a cross-connection such that the duality is
given by χΓθ (A, ¯π) : α 7→ θαθ−1; then α is linked to β if and only if β = θαθ−1.

Having characterized the linked cones for the cross-connection, now we describe

the cross-connection semigroup.

Theorem 17. Given a cross-connection (Π(X), P(X); Γθ), the cross-connection
semigroup ˜SΓθ is isomorphic to TX .

Proof. Using Lemma 16, we see that

˜SΓθ = { (α, θαθ−1) such that α ∈ TX}

Since U ∆θ−1 is a subsemigroup of T op
θαα′θ−1 where ∗ is the product in T op
given by

X , θα′θ−1∗θαθ−1 = θαθ−1θα′θ−1 = θα(θ−1θ)α′θ−1 =

X . And hence the binary operation in ˜SΓθ is

(α, θαθ−1) ◦ (α′, θα′θ−1) = (αα′, θαα′θ−1)

Now deﬁne a mapping ψ : TX → ˜SΓθ as α 7→ (α, θαθ−1). Clearly ψ is well-deﬁned
and onto. Also (α · α′)ψ = (αα′)ψ = (αα′, θαα′θ−1) = (αα′, θαθ−1θα′θ−1) =
(α, θαθ−1) ◦ (α′, θα′θ−1) = (α)ψ ◦ (α′)ψ. Thus ψ is a homomorphism. Now if
(α)ψ = (α′)ψ, then (α, θαθ−1) = (α′, θα′θ−1) and hence α = α′. Thus ψ is an
isomorphism and hence ˜SΓθ is isomorphic to TX .
(cid:3)

CROSS-CONNECTIONS OF THE TRANSFORMATION SEMIGROUP

11

Remark 18. Thus given a permutation θ on X, we can get a representation of
TX as the cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓθ corresponding to the cross-connection
(Π(X), P(X); Γθ).
Let T ∗
tion θ,

X = (TX , ∗) with the binary composition ∗ deﬁned as follows. For a permuta-

α ∗ β = α · θ · β

for α, β ∈ TX.

Then we can see that the representation Γθ described above refers to the cross-
connection arising from the semigroup T ∗
X .
If we deﬁne φ : T ∗

X → ˜SΓθ as α 7→ (θα, αθ), then

(α ∗ α′)φ = (αθα′)φ = (θαθα′, αθα′θ) = (θα, αθ) ◦ (θα′, α′θ) = (α)φ ◦ (α′)φ.

And further it can be seen that φ is an isomorphism.

Now we proceed to show that in fact these are all the cross-connections from

Π(X) to P(X).

Theorem 19. Any cross-connection Γ from Π(X) to P(X) is one of the form Γθ
for a permutation θ.

Proof. Recall that(see Deﬁnition 3), a cross-connection Γ : Π(X) → P(X) is a
local isomorphism Γ : Π(X) → Π(X) such that there is an associated dual cross-
connection ∆ : P(X) → P(X). Firstly observe that since ∆ preserves inclusion
and is an order isomorphism on ideals, if A ⊆ B then ∆(A) = j(A, B)∆(B).
Then deﬁne

(x)η = y such that ∆({x}) = {y}.

Since ∆ is a local isomorphism, ∆|hxi will be a bijection and hence η is well deﬁned.
Further η is injective. Suppose not. Then there exists a, a′ ∈ X such that (a)η =
(a′)η = b. This implies ∆({a}) = ∆({a′}) = {b}. Then ∆({a, a′}) = {b}. But this
is clearly not possible as ∆({a, a′}) has to be a bijection. Hence η is injective.
Also η is onto. Suppose not. Then there exists b ∈ X such that ∆({x}) 6= {b} for
any x ∈ X. That is ∆(X) ⊆ X\{b}. Now since ∆ is a cross-connection, for every
¯π ∈ Π(X) there exists a subset A ∈ P(X) such that ∆(A) is a cross-section of π.
If we choose π = {X\{b}, {b}}, then π is a partition of X and any cross section C
of π should contain b. But since ∆(X) ⊆ X\{b}, no such C exists and this leads
to a contradiction. Hence η is onto.
Now if we denote the permutation θ = η−1; then since A ⊆ B implies ∆(A) =
j(A, B)∆(B), we can argue as in [12](see equation (2)) to show that any cross-
connection ∆ from P(X) to Π(X) is one of the form ∆η = ∆θ−1 as deﬁned by
equation (11). Here for any A ∈ vP(X), ∆(A) = η(A) and given f : A → B,
η(f ) = η−1f η will be the morphism from η(A) to η(B). Now by the duality of the
cross-connections (cf. [10]), this implies that Γ = Γθ (see equation (10)) and hence
the theorem.
(cid:3)

And since the cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓθ is isomorphic to TX, we conclude
that every cross-connection semigroup arising from the cross-connections between
Π(X) and P(X) is isomorphic to the transformation semigroup TX.

3.2. Right reductive subsemigroups of TX . One class of semigroups we can
construct using cross-connections are the right reductive subsemigroups of TX . Re-
call that a semigroup S is said to be right reductive if the right-regular representation
of S, ρ : a 7→ ρa is injective (cf. [1]).

For constructing them we need to identify the total ideals of Π(X). An ideal I
in the normal dual N ∗C of a normal category C is said to be a total ideal in N ∗C
if for all c ∈ vC, there is some H(ǫ; −) ∈ vI such that c ∈ M H(ǫ; −). And using
Lemma 8, we have the following.

Lemma 20. An ideal I is a total ideal of Π(X) if and only if for every proper
maximal subset A of X, there exists ¯π ∈ vI such that A is a cross-section of π.

Proof. Suppose I is a total ideal of Π(X) and let A be a maximal proper subset
of X. Then by the identiﬁcation in equation (4) of N ∗P(X) with Π(X), there is
some ¯π ∈ vI such that A ∈ M H(e; −) where π is the partition induced by e. And
by Lemma 8, this implies that for every proper maximal subset A of X, there exists
¯π ∈ vI such that A is a cross-section of π.
Conversely assume that for every proper maximal subset A of X, there exists ¯π ∈ vI
such that A is a cross-section of π. Since I is an ideal, for every subset A of X
there exists ¯π ∈ vI such that A is a cross-section of π and using Lemma 8, we see
that I is a total ideal of Π(X).
(cid:3)

Lemma 21. If I is a total ideal of Π(X), then (I, P(X); Γ) is a cross-connection
where

(12)

Γ : I → Π(X) is the inclusion functor j(I, Π(X))

Proof. From the discussion above, (I, P(X); Γ) is a cross-connection if Γ : I →
Π(X) is a local isomorphism such that for every A ∈ vP(X), there is some ¯π ∈ vI
such that A is a cross-section of Γ(¯π). Since Γ is the inclusion functor, Γ is inclusion
preserving and faithful. Since I is a full subcategory of Π(X), Γ is full. Also for
each ideal h¯πi for ¯π ∈ vI, Γ|h¯πi is the identity morphism from h¯πi to hΓ(¯π)i = h¯πi.
So Γ is a local isomorphism. And since I is a total ideal, by Lemma 20, for every
subset A of X, there exists ¯π ∈ vI such that A is a cross-section of π = π′. Hence
Γ is a cross-connection.
(cid:3)

Lemma 22. Let ∆ be the identity functor from P(X) to P(X). Then for a total
ideal I of Π(X), (P(X), I; ∆) is a cross-connection such that for A ∈ vP(X)
and ¯π ∈ vΠ(X), A ∈ M Γ(¯π) if and only if ¯π ∈ M ∆(A). Hence ∆ is the dual
cross-connection of Γ.

Proof. Firstly, since I is a total ideal of Π(X), N ∗I will be isomorphic to P(X).
And hence ∆ = 1P(X) is inclusion preserving, fully faithful and for each A ∈
vP(X), F|hAi is an isomorphism(infact identity functor) of the ideal hAi onto
h∆(A)i = hAi. Also clearly the image of v∆ is total in P(X) and hence ∆ is
a cross-connection.
Then for A ∈ vP(X) and ¯π ∈ vΠ(X), let A ∈ M Γ(¯π). Since Γ = j(I, Π(X)),
Γ(¯π) = ¯π. Then by the dual of Lemma 8, A is a cross-section of π. Now since
∆ = 1P(X), ∆(A) = A and so ¯π ∈ M ∆(A). Similarly the converse also holds.
Hence by [10], ∆ is the dual cross-connection of Γ.

(cid:3)

Observe that although each cross-connection has a unique dual cross-connection,
it is possible for diﬀerent cross-connections to have the same dual, as seen in the
above lemma. Now given a cross-connection Γ and its dual ∆, we can associate two
regular semigroups U Γ and U ∆ with them (cf. [10]), which is described in the next
lemma.

CROSS-CONNECTIONS OF THE TRANSFORMATION SEMIGROUP

13

Lemma 23. Given a cross-connection Γ = j(I, Π(X)) and a dual cross-connection
∆ = 1P(X),

U Γ = S{α ∈ TX : Im α ⊆ A and ¯πα ⊆ ¯π : (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vI} and
U ∆ = S{β ∈ TX : Im β ⊆ A and ¯πβ ⊆ ¯π : (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vI}.

Here U ∆ is a regular subsemigroup of T Π(X) and since T Π(X) is isomorphic

to T op

X , the multiplication in the semigroup U ∆ is deﬁned as

α ∗ β = β.α for all α, β ∈ U ∆.

Given a cross-connection Γ with bi-functors Γ(−, −) and ∆(−, −), there is a natural
isomorphism χΓ between Γ(−, −) and ∆(−, −) known as the duality associated
with Γ and ∆. Then a cone γ ∈ U Γ is said to be linked to δ ∈ U ∆ if there is
a (c, d) ∈ vC × vD such that γ ∈ Γ(c, d) and δ = χΓ(c, d)(γ). The next lemma
characterizes the duality associated with the cross-connection deﬁned in equation
(12) and the corresponding linked cones.

Proposition 24. Given a cross-connection Γ = j(I, Π(X)) and the dual cross-
connection ∆ = 1P(X), χΓ : Γ(−, −) → ∆(−, −) is deﬁned as χΓ(A, ¯π) : α 7→ α.
And hence α is linked to β if and only if α = β.

Proof. Firstly observe that given the cross-connection Γ = j(I, Π(X)), Γ(A, ¯π) =
∆(A, ¯π) = {α : Im α ⊆ A and ¯πα ⊆ ¯π}. And so if we deﬁne χΓ(A, ¯π) : α 7→ α,
then χΓ(A, ¯π) = 1Γ(A,¯π) and hence is clearly a natural isomorphism.
Now given a cross-connection Γ = j(I, Π(X)), we shall say that α ∈ U Γ is linked
to β ∈ U ∆ if there is a (A, ¯π) ∈ vP(X) × vI such that α ∈ Γ(A, ¯π) and β =
χΓ(A, ¯π)(α). And hence it is clear that α is linked to β if and only if α = β.
(cid:3)

Having characterized the linked cones for the cross-connection, now we are in a

position to describe the cross-connection semigroup.

Theorem 25. Given a cross-connection Γ = j(I, Π(X)), the cross-connection
semigroup ˜SΓ is isomorphic to a right reductive regular subsemigroup of TX .
Proof. The cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓ deﬁned as ˜SΓ = { (α, β) ∈ U Γ × U ∆ :
(α, β) is linked } is a regular semigroup with the binary operation deﬁned by (α, β)◦
(α′, β′) = (αα′, β′ ∗ β). Using Proposition 24, we see that ˜SΓ = { (α, α) : α ∈
U Γ}. Now since the multiplication in the semigroup U ∆ is deﬁned as α′ ∗ α =
α.α′ for all α, α′ ∈ U ∆; the binary operation in ˜SΓ is (α, α) ◦ (α′, α′) = (αα′, αα′).
Now deﬁne a mapping ψ : ˜SΓ → TX as (α, α) 7→ α. Clearly ψ is well-deﬁned and
injective. Also ((α, α) ◦ (α′, α′))ψ = (αα′, αα′)ψ = αα′ = (α, α)ψ ◦ (α′, α′)ψ. Thus
ψ is a homomorphism. And using the regularity of ˜SΓ, we see that ˜SΓ is isomorphic
to a regular subsemigroup of TX .
Now the projection p : ˜SΓ → U Γ given by (α, α) 7→ α is clearly an isomorphism.
Then p = ρψ where ρ is the right regular representation of ˜SΓ and ψ : ( ˜SΓ)ρ → U Γ
is an isomorphism(cf. [10]). Hence ρ will be an isomorphism and so ˜SΓ is right
reductive. Hence the theorem.
(cid:3)

Example 1. If |X| = n; then there are (n
2 ) minimal partitions since any minimal
partition will have only one set of two elements and all other sets singleton. Also
there are n maximal subsets. For each minimal partition π, there are exactly two
cross-sections and hence two idempotent mappings with the given partition. And for
each maximal subset A, there are n − 1 idempotents with image A. Choose atleast

14

2 ) − (n − 2) minimal partitions and let I = ∪m

m = (n
i=1{ ¯πi ∪ { ¯πj : ¯πj ⊆ ¯πi}} and do
the construction as in section 3.2, we get the cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓ = T
as a right reductive subsemigroup of TX . Here ˜SΓ correspond to the subsemigroup
T of TX given by T = {α ∈ TX : ¯πα ∈ vI}.
For example, choose n = 5 and X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then m = (5
2) − (5 − 2) = 7.
Now deﬁne I by choosing all minimal partitions except π1 = {(12)(3)(4)(5)}. Then
T = {α ∈ TX : πα 6= π1} .ie it will contain all elements of TX except 120 elements
of the form (aabcd) where a, b, c, d ∈ X.

Corollary 26. In particular if we take I = Π(X) and the identity functor on
Π(X) as the cross-connection Γ, we have the cross-connection semigroup ˜SΓ of
(Π(X), P(X); Γ) which is isomorphic to TX .
