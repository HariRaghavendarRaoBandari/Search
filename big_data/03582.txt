Two majorana Fermions (MFs) localized at the two ends of the topological superconducting wire can interfere
with each other and form the well known 4π Josephson current. We reveal that the density of states (Dos) for
the electron part and the hole part also follow a parity correlated 4π period oscillation, while the Dos displays
a 2π period oscillation when two trivial states interfere with each other. Thus, the period of Dos oscillation can
be used to distinguish the MFs from the trivial localized states. Interestingly, such phenomena can be directly
observed in a short superconducting wire controlled by the gate voltage. This largely simpliﬁes the experimental
setup. We suggest that the interference effects can be detected through two STM leads or two norm leads.

Introduction — Following the suggestion of Kitaev that
MFs can appear as quasi-particle states at the ends of 1 dimen-
sional (1D) p-wave superconductor[1], how to realize MFs
in laboratory becomes a booming focus in condensed mat-
ter physics[2]. A number of proposals have been suggested
to fabricate and detect the MFs in effective 1D p-wave su-
perconductor system[3–9]. Among these proposals, a semi-
conductor wire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and proxim-
ity induced superconductivity is deemed as the most promis-
ing choice[3].
Indeed, the semiconductor superconducting
nanowire has been manufactured rapidly to response the pre-
diction of theory[10–12]. Next to the semiconductor sys-
tem, the second topological superconducting system realized
in experiment is related to ferromagnetic atomic chains be-
ing put on a trivial superconductor[13]. Both systems detect
MFs through tunneling experiment. It is believed that MFs
can cause zero-bias conductance peak (ZBP) in conductance
spectrum[14, 15] and indeed the experiment has observed
the signature of ZBP. However, ZBPs itself cannot imply the
MFs conclusively. Other sources can cause the similar phe-
nomena, such as the disorder induced trivial states or weak-
antilocalization[16–20]. To unambiguously determine MFs,
further efforts are greatly needed.

Besides ZBPs, another signiﬁcant feature of MFs is 4π
Josephson current. When two topological superconducting
wire put together to form a topological Josephson junction
(Top-JJ), the super current is 4π periodic if there are MFs ex-
isting at the ends of both wires. This is different from the
trivial case without MFs.
In trivial case only Cooper pairs
can tunnel, the periodicity is 2π. MFs enable the tunneling of
single electron in a Top-JJ. In this situation, the periodicity is
doubled. Since the 4π Josephson effect is an unique transport
property of MFs, many groups devote to realize it. However,
Combining two topological superconducting wire together to
form a Top-JJ is certainly a huge challenge to experimental-
ists. To date, there is no plausible 4π signature observed.
Kouwenhoven’s group have fabricated such junction but failed
to observe the 4π period[21]. Several groups have resorted to

normal leads are coupled to the ends of a superconductor ring which
supports MFs. (b) Density of states of coupled Majorana fermion in

holes show a 4 π oscillation though the total density is unchanged

havior with varying of the ﬂux. However, the period is an ordinary

superconductor-topological insulate-superconductor junction
which can also display the 4π Josephson current. However,
they only report the signature of edge state’s information[22–
24]. To realize the 4π Josephson current, some physical mea-
surement beyond the super current may be needed.

In this Letter, we study the Top-JJ in a ring heterostructure
wire as shown in Fig. 1(a). Unlike previous studies, here we
focus on the Dos for the electron part and the hole part. An
essential property of MFs is that its wave function of the elec-
tron part must be conjugate to its wave function of the hole
part, namely the self-hermitian property of MFs. Focusing
on the Dos of the electron part and the hole part can directly
manifestly the self-hermitian property of MF, this is the basic
starting point in this Letter. It is very interesting that the Dos
for the electron part and the hole part also display the 4π os-

(a)(b)(c)Bcillation. This is because the origin of 4π Josephson current
is caused by the interference of two MFs localized at the two
ends of the wire. Thus both Dos for the electron part and the
hole part show the information of interference. This gives a
way to identify the 4π periodicity through the local Dos. We
suggest this information can be read through two STM leads.
Since the 4π Josephson effects is caused by the interference
of two MFs, the similar information can be observed in a short
superconducting wire system. There two MFs are also local-
ized at the two ends of the wire, respectively. When the length
of the wire is compared with the coherence length of the MFs,
two MFs can interfere with each other through the supercon-
ducting wire. The more interesting thing is that the phase dif-
ference can be adjusted through the gate voltage, which cer-
tainly simpliﬁes the requirement of an experiment. A normal
lead-superconductor-normal lead (N-S-N) heterostructure can
read the interference effect through the electron transmission.
Model — We construct a quasi 1D TS wire and study the
interference effect of MFs. The TS wire used is a quasi-one di-
mensional s-wave superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit cou-
pling. Following Ref.[9, 16], the tight-binding model is:

t is the hopping amplitude, µ is the chemical potential, UR is
the Rashba coupling strength, Vx is the Zeeman energy caused
by a magnetic ﬁeld along the wire direction. ∆ is the super-
conducting pairing amplitude and Vimp(R) is the on-site ran-
dom impurity. Hend means the coupling between the two ends
of the wire (here we bend the wire to form a ring) and φ is
the ﬂux in the ring. To match the experiment in Ref.[16], the
parameters in the tight-binding model are chosen as follows:
∆ = 250µeV , t = 25∆, UR = 2∆, and the superconductor
coherence length ξ = t/∆a = 500nm. In addition, we set
Vx = 2∆ such that the superconducting wire can support the
MF end states by tuning the chemical potential.

4π oscillation of the density of states—It is well known
that MFs obey 4π fractional Josephson effect. Here we show
that the Dos of electron (hole) part of Andreev bound states
formed by two MFs also oscillate with 4π period.

The 4π period is directly related to the self-hermitian and
fractional nature of MFs. Self-hermitian requires that the
wave function of electron part must be the conjugate of the
wave function of hole part . Thus, a general wave function of
e−x/ξ. In a Top-JJ
as shown in Fig. 1 (a), two MFs will couple to each other

to form an Andreev bound states, the excited wave function
should be:

. (3)
Here, φ = φ2 − φ1, Nv = 0, 1 corresponding to the odd
and even states of the system E(φ) ∝ (−1)Nv sin(φ/2)[26].
We can get the Josephson current IJ = ∂E(φ)/∂φ ∝
(−1)Nv cos(φ/2), which shows a 4π periodic oscillation.
However, 4π needs a more stringent condition that requires
the parity conservation[27]namely, the evolution of the states
should follows one branch of the spectrum. While it is partic-
ularly susceptible at the degenerate point when the even parity
state and odd parity state cross the zero energy at φ = 2nπ.
The states will change from one parity state to another another
parity state due to the inﬂuence of quasiparticle poisoning,
background and thermal effect[28–30]. In this case, 4π will
return to the usual 2π. Thus, besides the technical challenges,
parity conservation is also a huge challenge in an experiment.
Fortunately, both Dos of electrons and holes oscillate with
4π periodicity with or without parity conservation since they
are parity correlated. From Eq.(3) we can see that Dos for
electron is |u±|2 ∝ 1 ± sin(φ/2) and the Dos for hole is
|υ±|2 ∝ 1 ∓ sin(φ/2). Which means we can distinguish
the 4π information by resorting the Dos of electron (or hole)
part along one energy spectrum. We do not need to worry
about which way to go as the system evolves, it is free to par-
ity conserving problem. Our numerical results directly ver-
ify this conclusion. We used the tight-binding model as de-
scribed in Eq. (1). The length of the wire is Nxa = 4µm
and tc = 0.4t. Fig. 1(b) shows the information of Dos
along E(φ) ∝ sin(φ/2) with setting the chemical potential
µ = −2t which lies in the topological region. As we adjust
the ﬂux φ, both Dos of electrons and holes oscillate 4π pe-
riod and parity correlated. While the Dos of electrons along
E(φ) ∝ −sin(φ/2) is the same as the Dos of hole along
E(φ) ∝ sin(φ/2).
Interestingly, when two trivial fermion
states interfered with each other, the situation is totally dif-
ferent.
In Fig. 1(c), when we set the chemical potential
µ = −2t + 4 which lies at the non-topological region, we
can see the period is 2π both for Dos of electrons and holes.
Detecting the 4π oscillation through two STM leads —
In the last section we have shown that the Dos of electrons
or holes in topological region is 4π periodic. A nature ques-
tion arising is how to detect the 4π periodicity of Dos. Naive
method is to put a STM lead (or normal lead) to detect the lo-
cal density. In reality, this does not work. When a STM lead
is put in the junction, we do detect a butterﬂy pattern conduc-
tance as we vary the ﬂux φ in Fig. 2(a) which can be deemed
as an unique property of MFs in our previous paper[31]. How-
ever, the peak value of the butterﬂy for each parity-conserved
energy spectrum is 2π periodic instead of 4π periodic. The
reason is that a single STM lead can only read the information
of local Dos through Andreev reﬂection(AR). The coefﬁcient

by gate voltage or chemical potential of the TS. (a) A schematic

the MFs can interfere with each other through the wire. Actu-
ally, there are a number of papers[32–34] consider about the
short wire case. However, most of previous works focus on
the non-local transport property of MFs, none of them studies
the interference pattern of Dos for electron part and hole part.
Only Ref.[34] has focused on the coupling energy of two MFs
in a short wire. They show that the coupling energy oscillate
with chemical potential EM ≈ (−1)Nv kF
sin(kF L).
x − ∆2 + µ is the effective fermi wave
vector which is the function of chemical potential µ or Zee-
man ﬁeld Vx. Thus, the phase difference kF L can be adjusted
through the gating voltage or Zeeman ﬁeld. Thus, we sug-
gest a setup as shown in Fig. 3(a) which consists of a short
semiconductor superconducting wire with a gate voltage that
controls the chemical potential. Fig. 3(b) shows the energy
spectrum varying with the chemical potential, the coupling
energy is oscillating with the chemical potential as Ref.[34]
revealed. The key question is whether the parity correlated
Dos of electron and hole part is still hold. The answer is yes.
However, there are several differences compared to a long su-
perconductor ring. First, there is a π phase shift due to the
fact that the wave function has reversed the direction. Sec-
ond,the wave function must propagate a length L to interfer-
ence with each other. Due to these reasons, the Dos of electron
part at the ends is |uend|2 = |1 + (−1)N ve(L)/ξe±ikF (L)|2 =
(1 + e−2L/ξ + (−1)N v2e−L/ξcos(kF L)). In Fig. 3(d), we
show the Dos of electron part and hole part at the ends of the
wire along spectrum EM ∝ |sin(kF L)| with increasing µ,
which means that the states change the parity each time when

of hole part of the leads, and EM is the coupling energy of
two MFs. Γe ∝ |u±|2 = 1 ± sin(φ/2) is proportional to
the Dos of electron part and Γh ∝ |υ±|2 = 1 ∓ sin(φ/2)
proportional to the Dos of hole part. Thus, AR read the
combined Dos of electron and hole part. What’s more, we
can see that if two MFs are uncoupled to each other , then
|u±|2 = |υ±|2 and TA will show the well known resonant AR
caused by MFs. To detect the local Dos of electron part and
hole part, we need additional information beyond AR process.
Thus, adding another STM lead to detect the electron trans-
mission (ET) or crossed Andreev reﬂection(CAR) between
the two leads is essential[32, 33], which can directly manifest
the information of Dos. In such process, The tunneling co-
efﬁcient for ET Te =
(ω−EM )2+(ΓLe+ΓLh+ΓRe+ΓRh)2 . Here
ΓL(R)e ∝ |u±|2 = 1 ± sin(φ/2) is the electron part self-
energy of STM lead L(R) which is proportional to the local
density of states for electron part. In Fig 2. (b) we show the
contour plot of Te versus ﬂux φ and incident energy E. We can
see that the peak value of tunneling coefﬁcient Te is propor-
tional to (1 − sin(φ/2))2. Combine both AR and ET, we can
know that the Dos of electron part is maximum at φ = 2π and
is minimum at φ = 0 for even parity energy spectrum of two
coupled MFs while it is maximum at φ = 0 and is minimum
at φ = 2π for odd parity energy spectrum of two coupled
MFs. Thus, both branches of Dos show the parity correlated
4π oscillation.

Similar oscillation behavior in a short semiconductor su-
perconducting wire—Since the origin of 4π Josephson cur-
rent is caused by the interference effect of two MFs. Another
interesting question we want to ask is that whether the inter-
ference effect in a short topological superconducting wire is
the same as the interference effect in the Top-JJ. In this case

pattern of Dos of electron or hole part will change correspond-
ingly and it is more obvious due to the π phase shift of the
interference. The Dos will experience a sudden change with
parity change.

In the last section we have shown that similar interference
effect can happen in a short superconducting wire and can be
controlled by chemical potential or the Zeeman ﬁeld. In the
following, we discuss how to detect the parity related oscilla-
tion behavior of Dos. As we have shown, two leads are es-
sential for detecting the whole information of Dos. Thus we
suggest an N-S-N structure for the detection as shown in Fig.
3(a). Fig. 4(a) shows the total conductivity can be measured
in the right lead. It constitutes two parts: CAR and ET pro-
cesses. Fig. 4(b) shows the contour plot of ET process Te
versus µ and E. It clearly show the information of interfer-
ence. In one region, the interference effect is constructive and
Te is large, while for another region, the interference effect
is destructive and the transmission coefﬁcient is very small.
Fig. 4(c) shows the contour plot of CAR process Th versus µ
and E. However, the peak value of CAR varies little with the
chemical potential and it is hard to see any information about
the interference effect.

In general, the probability of transmission as an electron or
a hole is the same due to the self-hermitian of MFs[32, 33].
While our numerical results show two distinctive results.
The reason lies at the novel interference effect of MFs.
Due to the interference effect of MFs, the Dos of electron
part is |uend|2 = 1 + e−2L/ξ + (−1)N v2e−L/ξcos(kF L)
while the Dos of hole part is |υend|2 = 1 + e−2L/ξ −
(−1)N v2e−L/ξcos(kF L). As we have shown, the probabil-
ity of CAR process is proportional to the joint density of
electron part and hole part, namely Th ∝ |uendυend|2 ∝
(1 + e−2L/ξ)2 − e−2L/ξcos(kF L)2 ≈ 1. Here we consider
exp(−L/ξ) as a small quantity and neglect the higher orders.
Thus, CAR is almost unchanged with the phase difference due
to the exponential decay exp(−L/ξ). However, the case for
ET is different. The coefﬁcient Te ∝ ΓLeΓRe ∝ |uend|2 ∝
(1+e−L/ξcos(kF L))2 ≈ 1+4e−L/ξcos(kF L). Then we can
see that the ET process is more sensitive to the phase differ-
ence and shows an oscillating behavior.

Discussion — A general current formulae for a Josephson
dt − dnh
dt ), here ne(h)
junction can be described as j = e( dne
means the Dos of electron (hole).
If we consider φ as the
time varying parameter, then we can see the Dos of the An-
dreev bound states is directly related to the well known 4π
Josephson current. Thus, detecting the 4π through the density
is meaningful. In addition, 4π needs invariance of the parity
conservation while Dos is free of such restriction. Then it is
more simple to detect the 4π via Dos.

The most surprising thing is that such interference effect
can happen in a short wire heterostructure and can be mea-
sured through the ET process. This greatly simpliﬁes the re-
quirement of an experiment. Another thing we want to stress
is that insensitivity of the CAR process directly manifests the
self-hermitian property of MFs. For two trivial states, the Dos

tential µ. (b) Contour plot of electron transmission coefﬁcient Te.
(c) Contour plot crossed Andreev reﬂection TA as a function of inci-
dent energy E and chemical potential µ. The electron transmission

of electron caused by interference effect should be 1+acos(φ)
while the Dos of hole should be 1 + bcos(φ) (we set a and
b as small quantity), in general Th ∝ 1 + (a + b)cos(φ),
Thus we can still see the interference effect caused by triv-
ial states in CAR process. As for MFs, self-hermitian requires
that a = −b, then it is hard to see the interference effect in
CAR process. Thus, the ET process and CAR process in such
a short semiconductor superconducting wire not only mani-
fest the non-local property of MFs but also manifest the self-
hermitian property of MFs.

Conclusion — We have shown that the Dos for electrons
or holes can directly manifest the physics of the 4π Josephson
current, due to the reason that the 4π Josephson current can be
interpreted as the interference of two MFs. Therefor, we can
identify the 4π periodicity through the local Dos of electron or
hole. The similar physics will appear in a short superconduct-
ing wire. We suggest all the information can be detected by
two STM leads or normal leads in the short superconducting
wire. In the short wire case, the ET process can show the in-
terference effect clearly while the CAR process is insensitive
to such interference effect. We show that the insensitivity is
protected by the self-hermitian property of MFs.

Effective Hamiltonian and Effective current formula —
Both the ring geometry and short wire cases there are two
MFs localized at the ends of the wire when the system lie
in topological region. The two MFs coupling to each other
and form an fermion states. If we add two normal leads to
detect the system, Both two systems can be described as a
norm lead-superconductor-normal lead (N-S-N) system. The
effective Hamiltonian Hef f = HL + HM + HT can be given
as follows:

α(0) + ˜tα,2eiφ/2ψα(0))].

Here, HN is the Hamiltonian of the left and right normal
leads, ψL/R denotes a fermion operator of the left (right) nor-
mal lead. vf is the corresponding Fermi velocity of the leads.
HM describes the two coupled Majorana fermions, where EM
is the coupling strength between the two MF end states γ1 and
γ2. The coupling between the leads and the MFs are described
by HT , where the coupling strengths are denoted by ˜tα,1 and
˜tα,2 respectively.

To calculate the scattering matrix of the system, we should
do a transformation ﬁrst. Remembering that a single MF is
just half of the ordinary fermion states, we can change the MF
representation to fermion representation γ1 = d + d†, γ2 =
i(d − d†), then HM and HT will change to :

self-Energy of α part of the lead l, which is renormalized by
the local Dos of the two coupled MFs and proportional to the
local Dos of the two coupled MFs’ α part. Thus, from scatter-
ing matrix we can read the information of local Dos. However,
just a single tunneling process can’t give the whole informa-
tion, we need more tunneling process to read the information.
Two leads are necessary in such case.

STMs information in trivial region in the ring geometry
— In main text we show that two STM leads can read the
information of 4π in nontrivial region. Here we show the tun-
neling results in the trivial case with µ = −2t + 4. Supple-
mental Fig. 1(a) show the contour plot of Andreev Reﬂection
coefﬁcient of a STM lead versus the ﬂux φ and incident en-
ergy E while (b) show the contour plot of electron tunneling
coefﬁcient Te. We can see that it is totally different from the
non-trivial case. Te do not cross the zero points and show two
peaks at the positional π and 3π, which means it is 2π periodic
in trivial region.

The case with the inﬂuence of disorder — Disorder is un-
avoidable in real system, it’s necessary to consider the in-

FIG. 6: The case with the inﬂuence of disorder, we can see that the
system is protected by topology and we can still see the information
of interference. The disorder strength is Vimp = 4∆ with disorder
equally distributed at range [−Vimp/2, Vimp/2]. (a) Contour plot of
total differential conductance from left lead to right lead with inci-

be described by two parts: Te contributed by electron transmission
and Th contributed by CAR. (b) Contour plot of electron transmis-

ﬂuence of disorder. Here we consider the inﬂuence of dis-
order in short wire case. As demonstrated by our numeri-
cal results, the interference effect is uninﬂuenced by disor-
der in a large region. The reason is that the arising of MFs
is protected by topology. Thus, the interference effect is al-
ways existing unless the MFs is destroyed by disorder.
In
supplement Fig. 2 we consider the case with the disorder
strength is Vimp = 4∆ which is equally distributed at range
[−Vimp/2, Vimp/2]. Supplement Fig. 2(a) shows the contour
plot of total differential conductance from left lead to right
lead with incident energy E and chemical potential µ. The in-
formation of interference effect can be well observed through
the total conductance.
It is the same as the main text that
the total conductance can be described by two parts: Te con-
tributed by electron transmission and Th contributed by CAR.
Supplement Fig. 2(b) gives the contour plot of electron trans-
mission coefﬁcient Te, We can see that the ET process dis-
plays the interference effect well. While the contour plot of
crossed Andreev reﬂection Th still hardly see the information
of interference due to the self-hermitian of MFs.

means it localized at the ﬁrst topological region. (a) Contour plot of
total differential conductance from left lead to right lead with inci-
dent energy E and chemical potential µ.(b) Contour plot of electron

same as the 1D case, we can watch the interference effect through
the ET process well. (c) Contour plot crossed Andreev reﬂection Th

Results using a two dimensional model — In the main text
we use the strictly 1D wire to stress our main point. However,
it is also quasi-2d or quasi-3d case in real system. In such
case, we can see several topological region as shown in our
previous result. Then a question arises as to: the interference
effect would be inﬂuenced when considering the quasi-2d or
quasi-3d case. In supplement material Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 shows

the results in higher dimensional case. Fig. 3 shows the results
in ﬁrst topological region while Fig. 4 shows the results in
second topological region. In both case we can see that the
ET process shows the information of interference effect well
but the CAR process is insensitive to the interference effect.

known that both the chemical potential and zeeman ﬁeld can

adjust the effective fermi wave vector well. Thus adjusting
zeeman ﬁeld can also change phase information well, then the
interference effect can also be displayed by adjusting through
a magnetic ﬁeld along the wire. supplement Fig. 5 shows
the results of the Contour plot of Th and Te. The interference
effect is clear in this case.

tor well. Through adjusting the magnetic ﬁeld we can also see the
