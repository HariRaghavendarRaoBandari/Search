It is known that each single typical pure state in an energy shell of a large isolated quantum system
well represents a thermal equilibrium state of the system. We show that such typicality holds also
for nonequilibrium steady states (NESS’s). We consider a small quantum system coupled to multiple
inﬁnite reservoirs. In the long run, the total system reaches a unique NESS. We identify a large
Hilbert space from which pure states of the system are to be sampled randomly and show that the
typical pure states well describe the NESS. We also point out that the irreversible relaxation to the
unique NESS is important to the typicality of the pure NESS’s.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the
“typicality” in the exploration of the foundations of sta-
tistical mechanics. It has been understood that each sin-
gle typical pure state in an energy shell well describes
a thermal equilibrium state of a large quantum system.
Indeed, a vast majority of the pure states in an energy
shell yield expectation values very close to those evalu-
ated with the microcanonical ensemble for a class of ob-
servables (microcanonical typicality) [1–3]. If we restrict
ourselves to observables of a small subsystem, their ex-
pectation values in the typical pure states well coincide
with those evaluated with the canonical ensemble for the
subsystem (canonical typicality) [4–6] (see also [7, 8]). It
has also been argued that given a realistic Hamiltonian
of interacting particles each energy eigenstate looks like
a chaotic thermal state (eigenstate thermalization) [4, 9–
11]. The importance of macro observables is discussed
[12] (see also [13, 14]). Typicality allows us to compute
expectation values and thermodynamical quantities at a
ﬁnite temperature only with a single pure state [15, 16].
It is also allowed to calculate higher-order moments of
observables [17]. This is important in evaluating physi-
cal quantities in the Heisenberg picture and thus in ana-
lyzing nonequilibrium processes starting from a thermal
equilibrium state. Equilibration/thermalization [9, 18–
24], temporal ﬂuctuations around equilibrium [25], and
relaxation times [26–28] have also been subjects under
intense study recently in the context of typicality, and
there are beautiful experimental works on the relevant
issues [29–31].

It is a challenging problem to explore the typicality for
nonequilibrium systems.
In particular, the nonequilib-
rium steady states (NESS’s) with ﬁnite stationary cur-
rents are of great interest [32–41]. In Ref. [42], we consid-
ered a NESS realized in a setup consisting of two inﬁnite
reservoirs interacting locally with each other, and showed
that there exists a large Hilbert space whose typical pure
states well describe the NESS: the typicality holds also
for NESS’s. We sample a typical pure state |φi randomly

from a Hilbert space HE1,E2 = HE1 ⊗ HE2 , where HEν
(ν = 1, 2) is the Hilbert space representing an energy
shell [Eν, Eν + ∆E] of the νth reservoir, and scatter it
by a Møller wave operator ˆW to construct a pure state
|φiNESS = ˆW|φi. Such pure states |φiNESS are typically
equivalent to the NESS, in the sense that the expecta-
tion values of an observable ˆA in the typical pure states
|φiNESS are very close to the expectation value in the
NESS: NESShφ| ˆA|φiNESS ≃ h ˆAiNESS. We call the pure
states |φiNESS typical pure NESS’s. We remark that the
initial pure states |φi sampled from HE1,E2 are generally
entangled states, rather than product states of the form
|φ1i ⊗ |φ2i sampled separately from the Hilbert spaces
HE1 and HE2 .

In this article, we generalize this construction of the
typical pure NESS’s to the case where a small quantum
system S (e.g., a quantum dot) interacts with multiple
reservoirs, often found in mesoscopic quantum junction
setups. We will see that the generalization is not triv-
ial, due to the presence of the small system S. First of
all, it is not clear at ﬁrst glance from which subspace,
in particular of the small system S, typical pure states
|φi to be scattered to construct typical pure NESS’s
|φiNESS = ˆW|φi should be sampled. We are going to
identify the relevant Hilbert space HNESS. To this end,
we will notice that the irreversible relaxation of the small
system S is important for the construction of the typical
pure NESS’s |φiNESS. Moreover, we will point out that
the naive perturbative approach is not useful to capture
the irreversibility and to derive the NESS, in contrast to
the case in the absence of the small system S. In these
respects, the present setup with the small system S re-
quires additional cares to study the typicality of pure
NESS’s |φiNESS, making the generalization nontrivial.

This article is organized as follows. We start by brieﬂy
recapitulating the typicality for equilibrium systems in
Sec. II and the standard approach to describe NESS’s
in Sec. III. We then provide the construction of pure
NESS’s |φiNESS in the presence of a small system S in
Sec. IV under the assumption of irreversible relaxation to
a unique NESS, and prove their typicality in the relevant

Hilbert space HNESS in Sec. V. To illustrate the relevance
of the assumptions, we look at an exactly solvable model
in Sec. VI. The article is ﬁnally summarized in Sec. VII.

II. TYPICALITY FOR EQUILIBRIUM

SYSTEMS

Before starting to discuss the typicality for NESS’s, let
us brieﬂy recapitulate the typicality for equilibrium sys-
tems. Here, we focus on the “microcanonical typicality”
[1–3, 15] (see [4–7, 16] for the “canonical typicality”).

We consider a large quantum system and pick a pure
state |ψi randomly from the Hilbert space HE spanned
by the energy eigenstates |Eji belonging to the energies
Ej within an energy shell [E, E + ∆E] (with the number
of particles ﬁxed at N ). The pure state |ψi is given by

|ψi =

d

Xj=1

cj|Eji,

(2.1)

where d = dimHE is the dimension of the Hilbert space
HE. We sample the pure states |ψi uniformly from HE
according to the Haar measure given by

dµ(|ψi) ∝ δ


Recalling the formulas

|cj|2 =

|cj|2|cj′|2 =

d(d + 1)

(1 + δjj′ ),

(2.3)

with the others up to the fourth moments of cj vanish-

ing [8, 43] [where O =R dµ(|ψi)O denotes the ensemble
average over the Haar measure], the average and the vari-
ance of the expectation value hψ| ˆA|ψi of an observable ˆA
over the uniformly sampled states |ψi are calculated as

hψ| ˆA|ψi =

and

hEj| ˆA|Eji = h ˆAimc,

(2.4a)

ˆρmc =

d

d

Xj=1

|EjihEj|.

(2.5)

This implies that the probability of the expectation value
hψ| ˆA|ψi in a sampled state |ψi deviating from the micro-
canonical expectation value h ˆAimc is bounded by Cheby-
shev’s inequality as

1

mc(cid:17) <

P(cid:16)|hψ| ˆA|ψi − h ˆAimc|2 > K(∆ ˆA)2
for any positive K. Therefore, if the system is so large
that the energy shell HE contains many eigenstates |Eji,
namely, if d is large, a vast majority of the pure states |ψi
in the energy shell HE exhibit expectation values close
to the microcanonical expectation value:

K(d + 1)

(2.6)

hψ| ˆA|ψi ≃ h ˆAimc.

(2.7)

This is the microcanonical typicality [1–3, 15]. Each typ-
ical pure state |ψi in the energy shell HE well describes
the thermal equilibrium state of the system characterized
by the energy E.

III. NESS WITH A SMALL SYSTEM

In this article, we are interested in NESS’s, rather than
equilibrium states. In particular, we discuss NESS’s re-
alized in a quantum system involving a small (ﬁnite-
dimensional) quantum system coupled to multiple (in-
ﬁnitely extended) large reservoirs [33–41]. For instance,
the simplest setup consists of a quantum dot placed be-
tween two reservoirs. See Fig. 1. The reservoirs are char-
acterized by diﬀerent temperatures and diﬀerent chemi-
cal potentials, and a steady current ﬂows from reservoirs
to reservoirs through the small system, say S, in a sta-
tionary state.

We ﬁrst recall the standard approach to NESS’s [32–
41], based on statistical ensembles. A natural way to
construct a NESS is to let the system evolve and relax
to a stationary state by itself. For instance, suppose that
the subsystems, i.e., small system S and reservoirs ν (=
1, . . . , M ), are initially disconnected from each other and
the reservoirs are in local equilibrium. The state of the
total system is described by the density operator

is the grand canonical state of reservoir ν, with βν being
its inverse temperature, µν its chemical potential, ˆHν its
free Hamiltonian, ˆNν the number of particles in reservoir
ν, and Ξν its partition function, while the initial state ˆρS
of system S is arbitrary. Then, at t = 0 we let the total
system start to evolve with the Hamiltonian

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,

ˆH0 = ˆHS +

ˆHν ,

M

Xν=1

(3.3)

with ˆHS being the free Hamiltonian of system S, which
admits only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent eigenstates, and
ˆV the interaction Hamiltonian describing the particle
transfers between system S and the reservoirs.
In the
long-time limit t → ∞, the total system would reach a
stationary state,

e−i ˆHt ˆρ0ei ˆHt t→∞−−−→ ˆρNESS,

(3.4)

which is a NESS. In this stationary state, a current can
ﬂow steadily. In particular, the expectation value of the
current operator

ˆJν = i[ ˆNν, ˆH],

(3.5)

describing the current ﬂowing from reservoir ν into sys-
tem S may exhibit a nonzero value in the stationary
state. This is the standard way to construct a NESS
ˆρNESS [32–41], based on the grand canonical ensembles.
Note that we are considering inﬁnitely extended reser-
voirs. If the reservoirs are of ﬁnite size, the whole system
might equilibrate in the long-time limit, becoming char-
acterized by a single temperature and a single chemical
potential. We are not going to discuss such an equilibra-
tion process of a ﬁnite system in the present study. We

3

take the thermodynamical limit (the large-volume limit)
before the long-time limit. From a mathematical point
of view the thermodynamical limit is important since the
long-time limit requires a continuous spectrum. The lim-
its actually exist in various models, and there are a bunch
of mathematically rigorous works on NESS’s. See, e.g.,
[33–38].

Note also that the relaxation to a NESS is an irre-
versible process and the choice of the initial condition
ˆρS for system S becomes irrelevant, except for particu-
lar systems. This irreversibility will be important for the
discussion of the typicality for NESS. In the following,
we assume that the NESS is unique for a given setup and
is independent of the initial state ˆρS of system S. We
will see later that it is actually the case for the model
studied in this article.

IV. CONSTRUCTION OF PURE NESS’S

In the previous section, we have recalled the standard
approach to describe NESS’s in terms of statistical en-
sembles. The objective of the present work is to show
that there exist many pure states |φiNESS which can de-
scribe a NESS, i.e., there exist many pure states |φiNESS
exhibiting the expectation values of an observable ˆA very
close to that evaluated in the NESS ˆρNESS,
NESShφ| ˆA|φiNESS ≃ Tr{ ˆρNESS ˆA}.

(4.1)

Such pure states |φiNESS are regarded as pure NESS’s.
Moreover, they are just typical states of a large Hilbert
space HNESS identiﬁed below: a pure state randomly
sampled from HNESS almost surely represents the NESS
as (4.1).
In Ref. [42], we have provided the construction of typ-
ical pure NESS’s |φiNESS in the absence of the small
system S between the reservoirs. The idea is to sam-
ple a typical pure state |φi to represent the initial ther-
mal equilibrium states Nν ˆρ(ν)
gc of the multiple reservoirs
ν (= 1, . . . , M ), and let it evolve by the Hamiltonian ˆH
of the system to a stationary state in the long-time limit
t → ∞ to get a typical pure NESS |φiNESS. Since the
reservoirs are initially in local equilibrium, each of which
is characterized by the energy Eν corresponding to its
inverse temperature βν and its chemical potential µν,
the relevant Hilbert space from which the initial pure
Eν is the
Hilbert space of reservoir ν spanned by the eigenstates
of ˆHν belonging to the energies within the energy shell
[Eν, Eν +∆Eν ], with the number of particles ﬁxed at Nν.
Now, in the presence of the small system S between the
reservoirs, what is the relevant Hilbert space from which
the initial state of S is to be sampled? We will see that
the answer is the whole Hilbert space HS of S: we do
not need to restrict ourselves to some energy shell of S.
The recipe for constructing the pure NESS’s |φiNESS in
the presence of the small system S is the following. We

state |φi is to be sampled is Nν H(ν)

Eν , where H(ν)

HS,{Eν },

(4.2)

according to the Haar measure. We then “scatter” it,

|φiNESS = ˆW|φi
by the Møller wave operator [44, 45]

ˆW = lim
t→∞

e−i ˆHtei ˆH0t,

(4.3)

(4.4)

to get a stationary state. We are going to prove that the
pure states |φiNESS constructed in this way almost surely
give the expectation values of an observable ˆA close to
that evaluated in ˆρNESS as in (4.1), and are regarded
as pure NESS’s. Such pure NESS’s |φiNESS are typical
states of the Hilbert space HNESS, which is isometric to
HS,{Eν } through the wave operator ˆW [44, 45]. A vast
majority of the pure states in HNESS well describe the
NESS.

V. TYPICALITY OF PURE NESS’S

by (4.3) actually represent a NESS.

Let us prove that the pure states |φiNESS constructed
First, we sample a pure state |φi from HS,{Eν} to rep-

resent the initial state ρ0 in (3.1),

where |E(S)

tem S and |E(ν)
Eν are the energy eigenstates of
ˆHν belonging to the energies E(ν)
jν within the energy shell
[Eν , Eν + ∆Eν ], while dS = dimHS and dν = dimH(ν)
Eν
are the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces. The dimensions
dν of the reservoirs are supposed to be ﬁnite for the mo-
ment, but the thermodynamical limit will be taken later
at certain point.

Note that the pure state |φi of the form (5.1) is not
a product state, but is highly entangled in general. A
naive way to represent the initial state ˆρ0 in (3.1) by a
pure state would be to represent each individual thermal
equilibrium state ˆρ(ν)
in the product state (3.1) sepa-
gc
rately by a typical pure state on its Hilbert space H(ν)
Eν ,
on the basis of the knowledge on the typicality for equi-
librium systems recapitulated in Sec. II. The state |φi
of the total system constructed in this way is a product
state, with no entanglement among system S and the
reservoirs. The set of such pure product states occupy

4

only a small portion of the Hilbert space HS,{Eν } in (4.2).
By (5.1), we explore a much larger Hilbert space, i.e., the
whole Hilbert space HS,{Eν }.
It is not trivial whether the highly entangled states |φi
of the form (5.1) represents the product state ˆρ0 in (3.1).
Let us prove it. We sample the pure states |φi uniformly
from HS,{Eν } according to the Haar measure [cf. (2.2)]

with the others up to the fourth moments of the coeﬃ-

get [cf. (2.4) and [42]]

(5.6)

This result implies that for large reservoirs (i.e., for large
D) the pure states |φi sampled from HS,{Eν } typically
yield

hφ| ˆA|φi ≃ h ˆAimc

(5.7)

with vanishingly small errors. Through the equivalence
between the microcanonical ensembles ˆρ(ν)
mc and the grand
canonical ensembles ˆρ(ν)

gc for large reservoirs, we have

hφ| ˆA|φi ≃ h ˆAigc,

(5.8)

where h ˆAigc is evaluated in the state
mc ⊗  M
Oν=1

ˆρgc = ˆρ(S)

ˆρ(ν)

gc ! .

(5.9)

This proves that the typical pure states |φi in HS,{Eν}
well represent the state ˆρgc deﬁned in (5.9), and hence
the local equilibrium states Nν ˆρ(ν)
gc of the reservoirs in

the initial product state ˆρ0 in (3.1).

On the other hand, the initial state ˆρS of the small
system S in ˆρ0 is not reproduced in ˆρgc in (5.9). This is,
however, not a problem in constructing the typical pure
NESS’s |φiNESS, provided the system admits a unique
NESS independent of the initial condition ˆρS for the
small system S.
Indeed, the state |φiNESS constructed
by (4.3) with a typical pure state |φi of HS,{Eν} yields

NESShφ| ˆA|φiNESS

= hφ| ˆW † ˆA ˆW|φi
≃ h ˆW † ˆA ˆWigc
= lim
t→∞
= Tr{ ˆρNESS ˆA},

Tr{e−i ˆHt ˆρgcei ˆHt ˆA}

(5.10)

where we have used the typicality of |φi in (5.8), the fact
that ˆρgc deﬁned in (5.9) is stationary under the action
of ˆH0, and the relaxation to the unique NESS ˆρNESS in
(3.4). Even if the state ˆρ(S)
mc of the small system S in
ˆρgc is diﬀerent from ˆρS in ˆρ0, the two initial conditions
ˆρgc and ˆρ0 yield the same NESS ˆρNESS in the long-time
limit, since we are assuming that the NESS is unique and
independent of the initial condition for S.

Equation (5.10) holds for any typical |φi in HS,{Eν},
and shows the typicality of the pure NESS’s |φiNESS.
Note that |φiNESS is isometric to |φi, connected by the
Møller wave operator ˆW [44, 45]. Therefore, the pure
NESS’s |φiNESS are typical states in the Hilbert space
HNESS which is isometric to HS,{Eν } through ˆW .
As stressed in Sec. III, we are interested in inﬁnitely
large reservoirs. But we actually start by sampling the
typical pure state |φi from the Hilbert space HS,{Eν } of
ﬁnite dimension D = dSd1 ··· dM . For large D, the typ-
icality (5.8) holds, and the expectation value in |φi is
replaced by that in ˆρgc deﬁned in (5.9), under the equiv-
alence between the microcanonical and grand canonical
ensembles. We then take the thermodynamical limit
to assure the existence of the long-time limit to get
the NESS ˆρNESS in (5.10). The thermodynamical limit
should be taken before the long-time limit t → ∞.
For such inﬁnitely extended systems, interesting ob-
servables ˆA [e.g., the current operators ˆJν in (3.5)] would
be unbounded operators. It is, however, not a problem
for the typicality. It is clear from the proofs of the typ-
icality in Sec. II and in the present section that what is
crucial for the typicality is not the boundedness of the
observable ˆA but the ﬁniteness of its expectation value

5

h ˆAimc and the variance (∆ ˆA)2
mc in the relevant micro-
canonical state: even if the observable ˆA is an unbounded
operator, the typicality holds as long as the microcanoni-
cal expectation value and the microcanonical variance of
ˆA are ﬁnite. It is the case for thermodynamically relevant
quantities (intensive quantities, or extensive quantities
per volume).

Finally, it would be practically easier to work in the
Heisenberg picture than in the Schr¨odinger picture to
analyze large quantum many-body systems. When cal-
culating the expectation value NESShφ| ˆA|φiNESS of an ob-
servable ˆA in a typical pure NESS |φiNESS, we would
scatter the observable ˆA as ˆW † ˆA ˆW instead of scatter-
ing a typical pure state |φi, and evaluate its expectation
value hφ| ˆW † ˆA ˆW|φi in the initial typical pure state |φi.
The typicality of pure NESS’s |φiNESS is then reduced to
the typicality of |φi for equilibrium systems. In the next
section, we will study a model in this way.

VI. MODEL

As stressed in the previous section, the irreversible re-
laxation to a unique NESS independent of the initial state
ˆρS of the small system S is important for the typicality
of the pure NESS’s |φiNESS constructed in Sec. IV. Let
us here look at an example. As we will see below, per-
turbative treatment is not useful for the discussion of the
NESS. Let us hence look at an exactly solvable model.

We consider a quantum dot S coupled to M fermionic

reservoirs. The Hamiltonian reads

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆV ,

ˆH0 = ˆHS +

ˆHν

kν ˆa),

(6.1c)

where ˆa and ˆbkν are fermionic operators satisfying
the canonical anticommunication relations {ˆa, ˆa†} = 1,
k′ν′} = δνν′ δ3(k − k′), {ˆa, ˆa} = {ˆbkν, ˆbk′ν′} =
{ˆbkν, ˆb†
{ˆa, ˆbkν} = {ˆa, ˆb†
kν} = 0, and we assume that Ω, ωkν >
0. We can also think of a bosonic system, with the
same Hamiltonian as (6.1) but with bosonic operators
ˆa and ˆbkν satisfying the canonical communication rela-
tions [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1, [ˆbkν, ˆb†
k′ν′ ] = δνν′ δ3(k − k′), [ˆa, ˆa] =
[ˆbkν, ˆbk′ν′] = [ˆa, ˆbkν] = [ˆa, ˆb†
kν] = 0. All the follow-
ing formulas are valid in both fermionic and bosonic
cases apart from a few signs (upper/lower signs are for
fermionic/bosonic case in the following formulas).

It should be noted however that in the previous sec-
tions system S is assumed to be ﬁnite-dimensional, ad-

mitting only a ﬁnite number of energy levels. It is actu-
ally the case in the fermionic case, while it is not for the
bosonic oscillator ˆa. Nonetheless, it is not crucial. For
the bosonic oscillator, we just have to restrict HS,{Eν } in
(4.2), from which a typical pure state |φi is sampled to
construct a typical pure NESS by (4.3): we replace HS
in HS,{Eν} with a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace ˜HS of HS,
e.g., by introducing an energy cutoﬀ in the initial state of
S. Due to the irreversibility of the dynamics, such details
in the initial state of S is irrelevant to the construction of
typical pure NESS’s. Note that by restricting the Hilbert
space as ˜HS we do not mean to truncate the Hamilto-
nian HS of S: we just restrict the Hilbert space from
which the initial state |φi is sampled, while the oscillator
S can evolve over the whole Hilbert space HS with no
restriction.

In obtaining the Fourier representation (6.5), we have
assumed that the total Hamiltonian H does not admit a
bound state. It is actually the case if the coupling λ is
not too strong, below a threshold value [46].

B. NESS

Let us look at a NESS in the present model, on the
basis of the standard ensemble approach recapitulated
in Sec. III. For the initial state ρ0 given in (3.1), with
the local equilibrium states of the reservoirs described
by the grand canonical ensembles ˆρ(ν)
gc given in (3.2), the
characteristic function of the total system is computable
exactly. By noting

The characteristic function χt[ξ, ξ∗, η, η∗] in (6.10) is ex-
act and characterizes the state of the total system at any
time t starting from the initial state ρ0 given in (3.1).

Now, notice that the Green function G(t) in (6.5) and
the kernel function Kη(t) in (6.13) are both decaying
functions of time t [48, 49], according to the Riemann-
Lebesgue lemma. Their convolution (Kη ◦ G)(t) also de-
cays, and therefore, ξ(t) in (6.12) decays to zero ξ(t) → 0
in the long-time limit t → ∞. As a consequence, since
χS(ξ(t), ξ∗(t)) → χS(0, 0) = 1, the characteristic func-
tion χt[ξ, ξ∗, η, η∗] in (6.10) becomes independent of the
initial state ρS of system S and approaches

This is the exact characteristic function of the NESS.
The ﬁrst exponential factor characterizes the state of sys-

current ﬂowing steadily between S and the reservoirs.

the exponents in (6.16). To properly capture the weak-
coupling regime, van Hove’s limit, λ → 0 keeping τ = λ2t
ﬁnite, is helpful. In this limit, we have [49]

It is worth noting here that the naive perturbative
treatment is not useful for the analysis, unlike the case
studied in Ref. [42], in which the small system S is ab-
sent between the reservoirs. This is clear from the fact
that the spectral function Γ(ω), which is quadratic in
the coupling functions ukν, is found in denominators in

¯G(τ /λ2) = G(τ /λ2)eiΩτ /λ2

→ e−[Γ(Ω)/2+i∆(Ω)]τ . (6.20)
This exponential decay is important for the relaxation to
the NESS irrespective of the initial state ˆρS of system S,
while the naive perturbative calculation fails to capture
this decay. In van Hove’s limit, we get the characteristic
function of the NESS

C. Typical Pure NESS’s

Let us now turn our attention to typical pure NESS’s.
We provided the construction of typical pure NESS’s
|φiNESS = ˆW|φi in (4.3), but it is practically easier to
compute relevant quantities in the Heisenberg picture:

instead of scattering a typical pure state |φi, we scatter
the observable ˆA by the wave operator ˆW as ˆW † ˆA ˆW ,
and evaluate its expectation value in the initial typical
pure state |φi in HS,{Eν}.

Let us consider the current operator ˆJν in (6.18). On
the basis of the solution (6.3) to the Heisenberg equations
of motion, the expectation value of ˆJν in a typical pure
NESS |φiNESS is evaluated as follows. As we stressed
in the previous section, we start with ﬁnite-size reser-
voirs (e.g., in boxes with periodic boundary conditions)
to sample a typical pure state |φi from HS,{Eν } (from
˜HS,{Eν} in the bosonic case). We compute the expec-
tation value of ˆJν in the Heisenberg picture, take the
thermodynamical (large-volume) limit V → ∞, and then
take the stationary limit t → ∞:

ˆbkν as well as ukν are scaled by √V compared to those
in the continuum limit, but by abuse of notation we use
the same symbols for their discrete counterparts as those
for continuous k.

The problem is now reduced to the evaluation of the
two-point expectation values of the canonical operators
ˆa and ˆbkν in the typical pure state |φi, i.e., hφ|ˆa†ˆbkν|φi
and hφ|ˆb†
ˆbk′ν′|φi. Recall that the typical pure state
|φi is sampled from HS,{Eν } = HS ⊗ (NM

In the long-time limit t → ∞, the term containing hˆa†ˆaigc
decays out and the above typical expectation value yields
the steady current (6.19) in the NESS.

It is a priori unclear whether a single pure state can
represent an ensemble describing a nonequilibrium state.
In this article, we have shown that it is actually the
case for NESS’s, even in the presence of a small quan-
tum system coupled to reservoirs. We have identiﬁed a
relevant Hilbert space HNESS whose typical pure states
|φiNESS are essentially equivalent to a NESS of the sys-
tem: the typicality holds also for NESS’s. To this end, we
have stressed that the irreversibility of the relaxation to
a unique NESS is important and nonperturbative treat-
ment is required.

Interesting future subjects include the issue whether
ﬂuctuation theorems [39–41, 50, 51] hold for isolated

quantum systems described by typical pure states (cf.
[17]). This further leads us to better understanding on
the physics of nonequilibrium systems and processes.
