Abstract

International Large Detector (ILD) adopts Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) for precise measurement of
multiple jets. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of ILD has two candidates sensor technologies
for PFA, which are pixelized silicon sensors and scintillator-strips with silicon photomultipliers. Pixelized
silicon sensors have higher granularity for PFA, however they have an issue of cost reduction. In contrast,
scintillator-strips have an advantage of relatively low cost and a disadvantage of degradation of position
resolution by ghost hits, which are generated by orthogonal arrangement. Hybrid ECAL using both
candidates is proposed to supplement these disadvantages.
In this paper, we report an optimization
study of the hybrid ECAL using detector simulation.

1 Introduction

International Linear Collider (ILC) is a future lepton collider which is expected to be constructed in Japan
[1].
It can measure higgs boson and top quarks precisely. This measurement is useful to search for new
particles and physics. International Large Detector (ILD) [2], which is one of the detector concepts in ILC,
have to have suitable structures for Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) because ILD needs to measure multiple
jets contained in ﬁnal states of these physics processes of ILC precisely.

PFA is a method to identify particles in a jet individually and to measure momentum and energy at
optimal detectors for each particle. Jet energy is measured by mainly trackers, ECAL and hadron calorimeter
(HCAL). At the trackers, momentum of charged particles is measured, where energies of photons and neutral
hadrons are measured at ECAL and HCAL, respectively.
ILD ECAL has two candidates of sensitive detectors (Figure 1). One is silicon semiconductor sensor with
5.5 × 5.5 mm2 pixels which has high granularity for PFA, however its cost reduction is an important issue.
The other is scintillator-strips with silicon photomultipliers as photon detectors. Its cost is relatively low,
however jet energy resolution is worse by ghost hits which are made by orthogonal arrangement of 45 × 5
mm2 strip when there are more than two hits on 45 × 45 mm2 area spontaneously.

We optimized a hybrid ECAL concept, which uses both silicon and scintillator detectors to reduce ECAL

cost and maintain its performance.

2 Optimization of hybrid ECAL

Recent baseline design of the ILD ECAL is described in the Detailed Baseline Design (DBD) report. The
structure uses pixelized silicon semiconductor as sensitive detectors which can reach high energy resolution.
However, it causes high occupation of cost ratio in the whole ILD cost. To deal with this problem, two ideas
are proposed. One is to reduce the whole size of ILD, and the other is to use hybrid ECAL instead of ECAL
with all silicon semiconductor.

This paper describes optimization study of hybrid structure with detector simulation.

2.1 Simulation framework

ILCSoft v01 16 02 is a software suite including numerous packages for physics analysis and detector optimiza-
tion of ILC, used for the following analysis. For the event generation, Whizard and Pythia packages are used
for di-jet events. Single particles are generated within the detector simulation software with particle guns.
Mokka is a detector simulation package based on GEANT4. ILD o1 v5 geometry in the Mokka framework is
used for the detector simulation. After the simulation, we performed the ILD standard event reconstruction,
including digitization of the hits, tracking and track ﬁtting, and PandoraPFA for particle ﬂow.

2.2 Setup of simulation

This study focuses on the hybrid ECAL with reasonable cost and performance. As an example, we set the
silicon sensors in ﬁrst 14 detector layers (inner region) and scintillator-tiles in the rest of layers (outer region)
(Figure 2). The number of silicon layers is ﬁxed because we would like to restrict the cost of silicon. For
the scintillator, we adopt 15 × 15 mm2 tiles. Comparison between tiles and strips is not in the scope of this
study and should be studied separately.

Figure 2: Conﬁguration of hybrid ECAL

In this study, we change the boundary between inner and outer region and the number of scintillator
layers, but whole thickness of absorber layers is ﬁxed (22.8X0 = 79.8 mm). Considered conﬁgurations are
listed in Figure 3 and Table 1-4.
As a performance comparison, we investigated energy resolution of di-jet (e+e− → Z → q ¯q) events
of various center-of-mass energies. We use RMS90 energy resolution obtained by PandoraPFA [3], and
PerfectPFA which utilizes MC information for clustering instead of real particle ﬂow. Confusion term is
deﬁned as squared diﬀerence of PandoraPFA and PerfectPFA.

2.3 Optimization of number of scintillator layers

Figure 4-7 shows the dependence on number of scintillator layers in hybrid 1-4 geometries. These plots show
that there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences among the variation of the number of scintillator layers contrary to
an expectation that increasing of the number of scintillator layers makes the resolution better. This may
caused by calibration procedure or diﬀerent thicknesses between silicon and scintillator layers. This will be
investigated in future studies.

We compared the jet energy resolution of considered conﬁgurations with that of silicon ECAL in DBD. For
this comparison, we picked up 4 considered conﬁgurations which had the least number of scintillator layers
in each boundary (Hybrid(1-1), Hybrid(2-1), Hybrid(3-1), Hybrid(4-1)) because these conﬁgurations has a
possibility of the biggest cost reduction. Figure 8 shows the result of jet energy resolution and confusion
term. It is seen that energy resolutions of PandoraPFA with the boundary in outer direction (Hybrid(2-1),
(3-1), (4-1)) are almost same as that of DBD structure at high energy. The reason of degradation of hybrid
conﬁgurations with respect to DBD conﬁguration is not identiﬁed and should be investigated further. The
conﬁguration with the boundary of 11.2X0 (Hybrid(2-1)) has average degradation of energy resolution of
2.7% with reducing the cost of about 30% compared with silicon ECAL in DBD. For the confusion term,
DBD conﬁguration has slightly better performance reﬂecting the diﬀerence in the pixel size.

silicon ECAL in DBD

3 Summary and Plan

We studied the performance of various hybrid ECAL conﬁgurations for ILD using ILCSoft v01-16-02. The
hybrid ECAL used silicon semiconductor in inner 14 layers and scintillator-tile in outer layers. We also added
a requirement that whole thickness of absorber was ﬁxed as 22.8X0. We changed the number of scintillator
layers and a boundary between inner and outer region, then we got a result that an hybrid ECAL with 16
scintillator layers and a boundary of 11.2X0 had degradation of jet energy resolution by about 2.7% compared
with DBD silicon ECAL with 30% cost reduction. Therefore, we guess that this hybrid ECAL is capable to
resolve the cost issue of ILD in this study.

Our future plan is to use medium region with alternating structure of silicon and scintillator to partially

reduce the eﬀect of confusion.
