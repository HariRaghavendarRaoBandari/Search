GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO THE

ELECTRODYNAMIC TWO-BODY PROBLEM

ON A STRAIGHT LINE

G. BAUER, D.-A. DECKERT, D. D ¨URR, AND G. HINRICHS

Abstract. The classical electrodynamic two-body problem has been a long standing open
problem in mathematics. For motion constrained to the straight line, the interaction is similar
to that of the two-body problem of classical gravitation. The additional complication is the
presence of unbounded state-dependent delays in the Coulomb forces due to the ﬁniteness of the
speed of light. This circumstance renders the notion of local solutions meaningless, and there-
fore, straight-forward ODE techniques can not be applied. Here, we study the time-symmetric
case, i.e., the Fokker-Schwarzschild-Tetrode (FST) equations, comprising both advanced and
retarded delays. We extend the technique developed in [5], where existence of FST solutions
was proven on the half-line, to ensure global existence – a result that had been obtained by
Bauer [2] in 1997. Due to the novel technique, the presented proof is shorter and more trans-
parent but also relies on the idea to employ asymptotic data to characterize solutions.

1. Introduction

The time-symmetric electrodynamic interaction of point-charges is described by the so-called
Fokker-Schwarzschild-Tetrode (FST) equations. Historically, these equations were ﬁrst dis-
cussed in the works [10, 11, 9]. Later Wheeler and Feynman took up these equations in their
seminal works [12, 13] to show that the electrodynamic arrow of time is derived from the ther-
modynamic one; see also [4]. In our case, in which we restrict ourselves to two point-charges
moving along a straight line having positions a(t), b(t) ∈ R at time t ∈ R, the FST equations
take the form

Here, we use the dot notation, i.e., any derivative w.r.t. time parameter t is denoted by an
overset dot such as ˙a(t) = d
dt2 a(t), and furthermore, units such that speed of
light equals one. Furthermore, κa, κb > 0 denote coupling constants and the so-called advanced
and retarded times t+
for i = 1, 2 are given implicitly as solutions to the following
equations

Thus, t±
2 are functionals of trajectory a and b, respectively. To keep the notation slim
we will often omit their arguments. Geometrically, equations (2) can be understood as the
intersection times of the forward and backward light-cones of the respectively other trajectory.
These intersection points exist as long as the trajectories a and b have velocities that are bounded
away from one, i.e., the speed of light.

We shall establish in this paper the existence of solutions to the FST equations (1) satisfying

a prescribed asymptotic behavior; see Theorem 2 below.

The presence of advanced and delayed terms is the main source of diﬃculty when aiming
at a global existence result. Namely, it implies that the right-hand sides of the equations of
motion in (1) involve not only terms evaluated at the same time instant t but also at the
respectively future or past times t±
i . Since these times are potentially unbounded functionals of
the entire trajectories, the notion of local solutions is meaningless as even a very small interval
of the trajectory a may depend on a very large interval of the trajectory b and vice versa.
Therefore, straight-forward ODE techniques based on ﬁnding local solutions ﬁrst and extending
them to global solutions with an additional a priori estimate can not be applied. A particularly
interesting question is therefore in which sense one may hope for a well-posed initial value
problem. Due to the delayed terms it is not clear if in general Cauchy data, i.e., position and
velocities of both charges at one time instant, suﬃces to characterize solutions uniquely or if
even whole strips of the trajectories have to be prescribed as initial data. In case the advanced
terms are omitted, the respective equations are called Synge equations. For this case, solutions
on the half-line can be found by integration, but obtaining global ones is still highly non-trivial;
see [7, 1, 5]. The goal of this work, i.e., Theorem 2 below, is to ensure global existence of
solutions to equations (1) including both the advanced and retarded terms. Before Theorem 2
can be spelled out precisely and its special formulation can be understand we need to recall
some previous results and discuss the asymptotic behavior of potential solutions.

To date the only result about uniqueness of solutions to the FST equations is given in [8].
There, uniqueness of solutions for two charges on the straight line was obtained in the special
situation of initially prescribed zero velocities and suﬃciently large separation of the two charges;
for a general discussion of valid initial data and uniqueness in the case of a FST toy model see
[6]. General global existence of solutions on the straight line was later shown in [2]. As yet the
only result towards a solution theory of the FST equations in three space-dimensions is given in
[3] where, for N rigid charges and a prescribed asymptotic behavior of the trajectories for times
|t| > τ , existence of solutions on [−τ, τ ] for arbitrary large 0 < τ < ∞ was shown. Apart from
the diﬀerent setting, the crucial diﬀerence in the latter two works lies in the prescription of the
initial data. In [2] it was given as asymptotic data in the remote past and in [3] as Cauchy data.
Both choices seem to have advantages and disadvantages: In order to use asymptotic data,
a priori, one must determine the asymptotic behavior of potential scattering solutions; until
now this was only done successfully on the straight line; see [2]. This knowledge then provides
suﬃcient global control on the charge trajectories to employ topological ﬁxed-point methods.
However, in general, such methods do not provide information about uniqueness and about
how the asymptotic data relates to potential data at ﬁnite times. On the contrary, possible
notions of initial data at ﬁnite times are suggested readily when recasting the FST equations
into integral form to yield potential candidates for self-maps. The trouble with this approach
is that one usually lacks suﬃcient control on the global behavior of the solutions in order to
apply ﬁxed-point methods globally. Because of this one is usually only able to prove existence
of solutions on ﬁnite time intervals as in [3].

In a recent work [5], for two charges on the straight line, it was possible to infer from prescribed
initial data existence of solutions not only in a ﬁnite time interval but on the half-line. More
precisely, it was shown in [5, Theorem 1.1]:
Theorem 1 (FST solutions on the half-line). Given an initial position a0 ∈ R and velocity
˙a0 ∈] − 1, 1[ of charge a at a time T ∈ R, and in addition, an initial trajectory strip b0 ∈
C ∞ ([T −, T +], ] − ∞, a0[) of charge b such that T ± = T ± (a0 − b0(T ±)), there is a trajectory
pair (a, b) fulﬁlling:
(i) Trajectory a fulﬁlls the equation of motion (1) for all t ≥ T and b for all t ≥ T +;
(ii) The pair (a, b) satisﬁes the initial conditions a(T ) = a0, ˙a(T ) = ˙a0, b|[T −,T +] = b0;
(iii) The pair (a, b) fulﬁlls a ∈ C ∞([T,∞[) and b ∈ C ∞([T +,∞[).

Henceforth, we will refer to such solutions as “conditional solutions” corresponding to the
prescribed initial data. This result is basic to this work: In order to prove the global existence
result for the FST equations, Theorem 2 below, we combine Theorem 1 with the a priori results
on the asymptotic behavior of solutions that were also exploited in [2]. The strategy of proof

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO THE FST EQUATIONS ON A STRAIGHT LINE

consists of two steps: First, we identify the asymptotic trajectories (x, y) of potential global
solutions. As it turns out, the velocities ( ˙a, ˙b) of any global solution (a, b) are bounded away
from one [5, (24a) in Proposition 2.1], and since ¨a > 0 and ¨b < 0 due to (1), they converge to
limiting values

−1 < u−∞ = lim

t→−∞

˙a(t) <

lim

t→−∞

˙b(t) = v−∞ < 1 .

(3)

Moreover, as we discuss in Section 2, it is even possible to show that these two asymptotic veloc-
ities together with two other reals x−∞, y−∞, referred to as asymptotic positions, parametrize
all possible asymptotes (x, y) of potential global solutions. In a second step, relying on this as-
ymptotic information, we will then extract initial data to infer conditional solutions conditional
solutions aT , bT satisfying

aT (T ) = x(T ) , bT|[T −,T +] = y|[T −,T +] ,

(4)

for suﬃciently large negative number T (meaning large magnitude |T| but T < 0), where

(5)
For convenience, aT and bT will be extended to all times t ∈ R by means of the asymptotes

2 (x(T ), y, T ) .

T ± = t±

aT (t) = x(t) for t ∈] − ∞, T [

bT (t) = y(t) for t ∈] − ∞, T −[ .

(6)

Since their velocities are bounded away from the speed of light uniformly in T we are able to
establish suﬃciently strong uniform estimates that allow to prove that a certain subsequence of
the family of trajectory pairs (aT , bT ) converges in a suitable sense to a global solution to (1)
as T → ∞.

The paper is structured as follows:

In Section 2 we discuss the asymptotic behavior of
In Section 3 we use the introduced notions to characterize the

asymptotes in order to formulate our global existence result in Theorem 2 and provide the
proof.

2. Asymptotic behavior of potential global solutions

As the highest derivative in (1) is on the right-hand side, one immediately observes that any
global solution (a, b) to (1) must be smooth. As discussed earlier (3), the velocities ˙a and ˙b of
any potential global solution have a modulus which is bounded away from one, which implies
that the implicitly deﬁned functions t±
in (2) are well-deﬁned and smooth. Moreover, because
i
of ¨a > 0 and ¨b < 0, the velocities converge monotonically to asymptotic velocities (3). Without
restricting generality, we will assume

throughout the paper. In other words, asymptotically, the velocities are constant, and to a ﬁrst
approximation, the diﬀerence a(t) − b(t±
2 (t)) can be expected to be of order t for large |t|. The
other terms on the right-hand side in (1) involve only velocities, so that the acceleration

for t → −∞, where we use the notation f (s) = o(g(s)) ⇔ lims
g(s) = 0 and f (s) ∼ g(s) ⇔
f (s)
g(s) = 1. The logarithmic corrections in (8) are characteristic to Coulomb interaction in
lims
3+1 dimensions and well-known in the case without delays (note that although we restrict the
dynamics to a straight line, we use the electrodynamic interaction, which is determined by the
Green’s function of the d’Alembert operator, in 3+1 dimensions).

The result (8) was obtained in [2] for the ﬁrst time, but since that publication is only available
in German and it is crucial for understanding the formulation of our main result, Theorem 2,
we shall brieﬂy discuss the intuition behind its proof here. This discussion will consist of a
rigorous part until equation (16) which will provide formulas that will be used in the proof of
our main result and, in particular, make the reader familiar with the terms (34)-(38) below.
The shorter second part will then explain in a nonrigorous way how the estimate (16) leads to
(8) including an identiﬁcation of the constant C. However, a proof of the latter will not be given
in this section. Rather, it will proven as part of the main result Theorem 2 that the established
solutions comply with the asymptotic behavior given here.

In order to infer more details about the asymptotic behavior, it is convenient to bring the

we choose a scaling such that T ≪ t ≪ 0. In this case, thanks to the equation of motion (1),
for each acceleration one gains again a (a(t) − b(t±

Next, in the second part, we discuss nonrigorously how (16) leads to (8) and how to identify

next for the case of global solutions. Using ansatz (8) for a and omitting the remainder terms
gives

3. Main result and its proof

Based on the information about the asymptotic behavior of solutions that was provided in
Section 2 we can now make our main result precise. As Banach space for the potential solutions
to the FST equations (1) we employ the space B of pairs of trajectories (a, b) ∈ C1(R, R2)

Theorem 2 (Global Existence). Let

and

x−∞, y−∞ ∈ R, −1 < u−∞ < v−∞ < 1

x(t) = x−∞ + u−∞t − η1 ln|t|
y(t) = y−∞ + v−∞t + η2 ln|t|

for t < −1

(19)

with η1 and η2 deﬁned in eq. (15), (17). Then, the following statements hold true:
(i) There exists a global solution (a, b) ∈ C ∞(R, R2) to the FST equations (1) with

a(t) = x(t) + O(cid:18) ln|t|

t (cid:19) , b(t) = y(t) + O(cid:18) ln|t|
t (cid:19)

for t → −∞.

(ii) Let furthermore T0 < −1 be a suﬃciently large negative number such that x(t) > y(t) and
| ˙x(t)|,| ˙y(t′)| < 1 for all t ≤ T0 and t′ ≤ T +
is fulﬁlled, and let (aT , bT )T ≤T0 denote the
family of conditional solutions to the FST equations (1) inferred by Theorem 1 satisfying
the initial conditions (4), (5). Then, there is a sequence (Tn)n∈N with limn→∞ Tn = −∞

n→∞k(aTn , bTn) − (a, b)k = 0.

The proof will be given at the end of this section. Before we will collect some more technical
results. At the core of our proof are estimates that show a uniform closeness of the conditional
solutions (aT , bT ) and their velocities ( ˙aT , ˙bT ) to the asymptotes (x, y) and the asymptotic
velocities (u−∞, v−∞), respectively.

Lemma 1. Let T0 be a suﬃciently large negative number as in Theorem 2. There are t0 < T0
and C > 0 such that, for all T ≤ t0 and t ∈ [T, t0],

Lemma 1 will be proven with the help of two further lemmata.
Note that the pair of asymptotes (x, y) scatter apart for t → −∞. The time instant t0, thus,
has to be chosen to be a suﬃciently large negative number such that the choice (4), (5) of the
2 ))2 in
initial conditions on x and y ensures a suﬃcient decay of the Coulomb terms
the FST (1) equations for t ≤ t0. At ﬁrst the estimates (20) and (21) can be more easily derived
from the FST (1) equations under additional assumptions on the distance and relative velocity
of a and b that ensure such a decay:

(aT (t)−bT (t

Lemma 2. Let T0 be a suﬃciently large negative number as in Theorem 2. Furthermore, let
also t0 < T0 be suﬃciently large, T ≤ t0 and

µ :=

u−∞ − v−∞

< 0 .

Assume that there is a t∗ ∈]T, t0] such that

aT (t) − bT (t) ≥ µt,

˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) ≤ µ

for all t ∈ [T, t∗] .

(22)

Then, estimates (20) and (21) hold true for all t ∈ [T, t∗] and a suitable C > 0.

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO THE FST EQUATIONS ON A STRAIGHT LINE

Nevertheless, the computations are tedious and therefore deferred to section 3.1.

At ﬁrst sight, this might look circular: We can prove (20), (21) under the decay assumption
(22), but in order to prove the latter, something like (20), (21) (at least in a slightly weakened
form) seems to be necessary. However, by deﬁnition of x and y, limt→−∞ ( ˙x(t) − ˙y(t)) = 2µ, so
that the initial conditions (4) fulﬁll

and

aT (T ) − bT (T ) = x(T ) − y(T ) > µT
˙aT (T ) − ˙bT (T ) = ˙x(T ) − ˙y(T ) < µ

suﬃciently large negative T . Therefore, if t0 is adapted conveniently, continuity of (aT ,bT )
implies that at least a small interval [T, t∗], potentially with t∗ < t0, on which (22) and thus,
by Lemma 2, (20) and (21), hold true, exists. But if (20) and (21) hold on some interval, one
can readily show that (22) is satisﬁed on a larger one:
Lemma 3. Let t0 be a suﬃciently large negative number, T as in Lemma 2, and t∗ ∈]T, t0]
such that estimates (20) and (21) hold true for all t ∈ [T, t∗]. Then, there exists t∗∗ ∈]t∗, t0]
such that
(24)

˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) ≤ µ

for all t ∈ [T, t∗∗] .

aT (t) − bT (t) ≥ µt,

By iterating Lemma 2 and 3, one then arrives at Lemma 1.

Proof of Lemma 3. By assumption (21) and deﬁnition (19) of x and y,

(23)

(25)

(26)

aT (t) − bT (t) ≥ x(t) − y(t) −

2C

for t ∈ [T, t∗]. The bracket becomes positive for suﬃciently large |t0| and t ≤ t0, so

aT (t) − bT (t) > µt

in this case and, by continuity, “≥” is satisﬁed on on some larger closed interval. Moreover, by
assumption (20),

˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) ≤ u−∞ − v−∞ +

C

|t| ≤ µ +(cid:18)µ +

C

|t0|(cid:19)

for t ∈ [T, t∗]. Here, the bracket becomes negative for suﬃciently large |t0|, implying

˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) < µ for t ∈ [T, t∗]

and, again, “≤” holds on some larger interval. This implies the existence of a t∗∗ ∈]t∗, t0] such
that (24) holds.

(cid:3)

Now we prove Lemma 1:

Proof of Lemma 1. Fix a suﬃciently large negative t0 such that both Lemma 2 and 3 are appli-
cable and inequality (23) holds true for all T ≤ t0. Iterated application of these two lemmata
reveals that inequalities (22) hold true on [T, t0]: Assuming the contrary, ﬁx T as required and
deﬁne

˜t := infnt ∈ [T, t0] | aT (t) − bT (t) < µt ∨ ˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) > µo .

By continuity of aT and bT , inequalities (22) are fulﬁlled on [T, ˜t], so Lemma 2 implies that
Lemma 3 is applicable with t∗ = ˜t, resulting in a contradiction to the deﬁnition of ˜t.

By deﬁnition (6), aT (t) − x(t) = 0 = bT (t) − y(t) for t ≤ T , so inequalities (21) are also valid

(cid:3)

for such times t.

Beyond the estimates in Lemma 1 for large negative t, we need a priori estimates for all t ∈ R

that prevent the terms in the FST equations (1) from becoming singular:

Lemma 4. Let t0 be a suﬃciently large negative number as in Lemma 1. There are V ∈ [0, 1[
and D > 0 such that all conditional solutions for (aT , bT ) with T ≤ t0 corresponding to initial
conditions (4) with asymptotes in (19) satisfy

and

k ˙aTk∞,k˙bTk∞ ≤ V

aT (t) − bT (t) ≥ D(1 + |t|) for all t ∈ R .

(27)

(28)

Before we discuss the proof, we remark that (27) is a corollary to Proposition 2.1 from [5],
but (28) is deduced from Lemma 1. This poses no problem since (28) will only be exploited
in the proof of the main result Theorem 2, whereas the estimate (27) will be used throughout
the proof of Lemma 2.
In the proof of Lemma 4, and whenever dealing with the advanced
and retarded times, the following estimates, already mentioned before in (12) and proven in [5,
Lemma 2.1], will be useful:
Lemma 5. For any C 1-trajectories (a, b) with k ˙ak∞,k˙bk∞ ≤ C < 1 and a(t) > b(t) for all
t ∈ R, the advanced and retarded times t±

introduced in (2) are globally well-deﬁned and

Proof of Lemma 4: According to the proof of Proposition 2.1 in [5] (the equation after 29), for
any conditional solution with initial data aT (T ) = a0, ˙aT (T ) = ˙a0, bT|[T −,T +] = b0 the estimate

holds true.
In [5], it was formulated only for the case T = 0, but it holds without change
for diﬀerent t. x0 denotes a reference trajectory, which, in the case at hand, can be chosen
in such a way that k ˙x0k∞ = u where u is an arbitrary number between supt≤T0 | ˙x(t)| and 1.
Substituting as initial data the corresponding segments of the asymptotes x, y and recalling
from their explicit form (19) and the choice of t0 ≤ T0 that their velocities are bounded away
from 1 and the distances a0 − b0(T ) from 0, we conclude
t≥T | ˙aT (t)| < 1 .
sup

sup
T ≤t0

Since aT (t) = x(t) for t ≤ T , we get

sup
T ≤t0 k ˙aTk∞ < 1

and, by the analogous reasoning for b, the existence of V ∈]0, 1[ such that

k ˙aTk∞,k˙bTk ≤ V

for all T ≤ t0. Estimate (30) in [5] then implies the existence of a uniform lower bound for
inf t≥T (aT (t) − bT (t)) and T ≤ t0 which, as the distance of the asymptotes is bounded away
from 0, can again be extended to a bound ˜D valid for all t ∈ R.
In order to prove (28), it remains to ﬁnd a negative upper bound for ˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) for
suﬃciently large negative t and a positive lower bound for suﬃciently large t, both uniform in
T . The ﬁrst of them is immediately given by Lemma 1, inequality (20), and the fact that u−∞−
v−∞ < 0. To ﬁnd the latter, we employ a proof by contradiction. We observe that, according
to Lemma 1, we can ﬁnd S, V ′ and D′ such that aT (S) − bT (S) ≤ D′ and ˙aT (S) − ˙bT (S) ≥ V ′

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO THE FST EQUATIONS ON A STRAIGHT LINE

hold true for all T ≤ t0. Assuming now that ˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) ≤ 0 for all t ∈ [S, ˜S] with ˜S > S,
Lemma 5 together with the uniform velocity bound (27) implies

for these t and thus, due to (7) and the equation (1) of motion, yields a uniform lower bound

must be positive for a suﬃciently large ˜S independent of T .

From time ˜S on, one gets a uniform upper bound on a(t) − b(t+

2 ) by assuming that a moved
to the right and b to the left with the maximal possible velocity V already from time S on.
The resulting lower bound on ¨aT (t) for t ≥ ˜S and the analogous upper one on ¨bT (t) lead to the
desired uniform positive lower bound on ˙aT (t) − ˙bT (t) e.g. for times t ≥ ˜S + 1.

(cid:3)

The sequence (aTn, bTn ) as in the Theorem can now be found by a compactness argument.
We formulate an appropriate generalization of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, the proof of which
can be found in [5, Lemma 2.3]:

Lemma 6. If a sequence f1, f2, . . . of bounded continuous functions on R is uniformly bounded
and equicontinuous and

lim
S→∞

sup

t>S,n∈N

max {|fn(t) − fn(S)|,|fn(−t) − fn(−S)|} = 0 ,

(29)

then it has a uniformly convergent subsequence.

Finally, with these technical lemmata, we can prove our main result:

Proof of Theorem 2. Recall the family of solutions on the half-line (aT , bT )T ≤T0 corresponding
to the initial conditions (4) that are provided by Theorem 1. The proof is divided in several steps:

1) Existence of an accumulation point: We start by observing that ( ˙aT )T ≤t0 is uniformly
bounded according to Lemma 4. For t ≥ T , according to the FST equations (1) and Lemmata 5
and 4,

holds for a suitable C > 0 for all t ≤ T ≤ t0. Consequently, for all s, t ∈ R with s < t, we have

0 < ¨aT (t) ≤

1 + t2

| ˙aT (t) − ˙aT (s)| ≤Z t

s

C

1 + u2 du ,

implying that ( ˙aT )T ≤t0 is equicontinuous and that condition (29) from Lemma 6 is fulﬁlled, so
that a uniformly convergent sequence ( ˙aTn)n∈N with Tn

n→∞

−−−→ −∞ exists.

GLOBAL SOLUTIONS TO THE FST EQUATIONS ON A STRAIGHT LINE

11

Furthermore, choosing t ≤ t0 and using estimate (21) from Lemma 1 together with | ˙aT (t)| ≤ 1,

gives

aT (t) +Z 0

|aT (0)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˙aT (s)ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

This shows us that (aT (0))T ≤t0 is bounded. Therefore, for a suitable subsequence (Tnk )k∈N
of (Tn)n∈N, also (aTn
(0))k∈N converges. From (Tnk )k∈N, we can, by an analogous reasoning,
extract a subsequence (Tnki
(0))i∈N converge. In conclu-
sion, there is a subsequence, with slight abuse of notation again denoted by (an, bn)n∈N, which
converges with respect to the norm (18).

2) Estimates for the accumulation point. Estimate (21) in Lemma 1, as well as Lemma 4,

hold also true for

(a, b) := lim
n→∞

(an, bn) .

This can be seen by applying these estimates to (an(t), bn(t)) for ﬁxed t and exploiting the
convergence an(t) → a(t) and bn(t) → b(t) for n → ∞. Therefore,

a(t) = x(t) + O(cid:18) ln|t|
|t| (cid:19) ,

b(t) = y(t) + O(cid:18) ln|t|
|t| (cid:19) .

3) Fulﬁllment of the FST equations. First, we observe that, according to Lemma 4 and 5, for
(a, b), the advanced and retarded times t±
in (2) are well-deﬁned, and so is the right-hand sides
i
of the FST equations. It remains to show that (a, b) solve the FST equations. The integral

Hence, it suﬃces to show that we may exchange the limit n → ∞ with the integration. For
this it is suﬃcient to show that the integrand converges uniformly on compact intervals [−S, S];
and likewise one has to repeat the proof for ˙bn. However, we know that an, ˙an, bn, ˙bn converge
uniformly thanks to the deﬁnition of the norm, the denominators are bounded away from
zero by Lemma 4, and furthermore, the uniform convergence of t±

Note that the supremum is ﬁnite since t±
2 is continuous. Hence, we may interchange the limit
n → ∞ with the integral in (31); and likewise for the corresponding integral equation for bn.
By Theorem 1 and the uniform convergence, we know that (a, b) is smooth. Hence, we may
take the derivate of the integral equations (31) recover the FST equations (1).

In summary, the last step proves the existence of a smooth global solution to the FST
equations (1) that results from the convergence of the sequence (an, bn)n∈N, which furthermore
obeys the asymptotic behavior (30), which concludes the proof.

3.1. Proof of Lemma 2. In this last section we provide the remaining proof of Lemma 2.
Recall that Lemma 2 is supposed to ensure the claims of Lemma 1, i.e., estimate (20) and (21),
under the stronger condition (22). In the following we prove both claims separately denoted by
Part I and Part II. We only show the estimates for aT , the ones for bT are obtained analogously.
In our notation, C will denote ﬁnite and positive constants that may vary from line to line.

Ideally we would like to proof Lemma 2 assuming only that T ≤ T0 and that t∗ ∈]T, T0]
exists such that estimates (22) hold true for all t ∈ [T, t∗], and consider t ∈ [T, t∗]. However,
several steps in the proof of Lemma 2, including the auxiliary lemmata in this section, will only
hold under ﬁnitely many additional conditions of the form that t is a suﬃciently large negative
number, i.e., t ≤ tn for ﬁnitely many tn. Since we pick up these extra constraints along the way
in the proof of Lemma 2, we possibly have to adjust T0 each time and start over the with the
proof – at most ﬁnitely many times. This is unproblematic since all previous estimates hold
also for larger negative values of T0.

Therefore, in order to keep the presentation reasonably short we employ a slight abuse of
notation to avoid repetition of the proof: Instead of keeping T0 ﬁxed, we adjust its value from
T0 to T0 ∧ tn each time we pick up another constraint t ≤ tn, keeping in mind that in the end,
the proof will only hold for t0 := minn tn – exactly in the form given in Lemma 2.

Proof of Lemma 2, Part I: Estimate (20). We observe that ¨aT (t) > 0 for t > T and, by deﬁ-
nition (19), also ¨aT (t) = η1
t2 > 0 holds true for t < T . Hence, limt→−∞ ˙aT (t) = u−∞ implies
˙aT (t) > u−∞ for all t. Using the integrated equation of motion (9) (for aT instead of a), the
velocity estimate (27), Lemma 5 and assumption (22), we ﬁnd

In order to prove estimate (21) and with it provide Part II of the proof of Lemma 2, we use
the fact that equation (14) also holds true for (aT , bT ) instead of (a, b) as long as t ∈ [T, t∗];
in the following we refer to (14) in the sense of (a, b) replaced by (aT , bT ). Our goal is to
employ this formula in order to estimate the distance |aT (t) − x(t)| by observing cancellations
or asymptotically vanishing terms. Term (14a) now reads

In order to gain some intuition about the terms, we observe that the ﬁrst two summands cancel
with the ones in deﬁnition (19) of x. Moreover, as indicated in the section 2, the factor of
term (14b) in front of (t− T ), multiplied by T , converges to η1. Thus, term (14b) should cancel
the last summand in (32) asymptotically . Term (14c) approaches

Note that the term A3(t) in (36) is constant in t and fulﬁlls A3(t) = A2(T ). If t = T , then aT (t) =
x(t) and bT (t) = y(t) and, for suﬃciently large negative t, the deﬁnition of the asymptotes (x, y)
in (19) yields

|A3(t)| = |A2(T )| ≤ C

where C1, C2 are not necessarily positive constants. Recalling the choice u−∞ < v−∞, we have

In order to provide a similar bound for A2(t) for general t, we ﬁrst need an upper bound on
aT (t) − bT (t) to estimate the right-hand side of (60). This can be obtained by collecting the
preceding estimates together in the form (40): First, we may omit the terms in (40) involving
ln(cid:0)aT (t) − bT (t±

Applying now (40) in the opposite direction and using, beside the estimate just derived,
Lemma 4 and inequality (22) for the velocities, we obtain

Together with the upper bound, this implies

In summary, we have shown that (39) holds for T ≤ t ≤ t∗ which concludes the proof of
