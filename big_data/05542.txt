ABSTRACT

A sub-set of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), with X-ray luminosities
well above 1040 erg s−1, typically have energy spectra which can be well described as hard
power-laws, and short-term variability in excess of ∼ 10%. This combination of properties
suggests that these ULXs may be some of the best candidates to host intermediate mass black
holes (IMBHs), which would be accreting at sub-Eddington rates in the hard state seen in
Galactic X-ray binaries. In this work, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of all of
the available XMM-Newton data from one such ULX, the previously poorly studied 2XMM
J143242.1−440939, located in NGC 5643. We report that its high quality EPIC spectra can
be better described by a broad, thermal component, such as an advection dominated disc or
an optically thick Comptonising corona. In addition, we ﬁnd a hint of a marginal change in
the short-term variability which does not appear to be clearly related to the source unabsorbed
luminosity. We discuss the implications of these results, excluding the possibility that the
source may be host an IMBH in a low state, and favouring an interpretation in terms of super-
Eddington accretion on to a black hole of stellar origin. The properties of NGC 5643 ULX1
allow us to associate this source to the population of the hard/ultraluminous ULX class.

INTRODUCTION

Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) are extragalactic, point-like,
non-nuclear sources that are characterised by isotropic X-ray lu-
minosities greater than 1039 erg s−1 (e.g. Fabbiano 1989), which
is close to the Eddington limit of a 10 M(cid:12) black hole (BH). Ob-
servational evidence strongly suggests that the majority of ULXs
are accreting BH X-ray binaries (XRBs) with massive donors (e.g.
Zampieri & Roberts 2009; Feng & Soria 2011; and references
therein). Luminosities higher than ∼3×1039 erg s−1 rule out Ed-
dington limited accretion onto typical stellar-mass BHs (sMBHs,
4 − 20 M(cid:12)), and the non-nuclear locations of ULXs in their host
galaxies rules out accretion on to supermassive BHs. Despite this,
it has been proposed that ULXs may be powered by accretion on
to either sMBHs (King et al. 2001) or massive stellar BHs formed

(cid:63) pintore@iasf-milano.inaf.it,
fabio.pintore@dsf.unica.it

in low-metallicity environments ((cid:54) 80 M(cid:12); Zampieri & Roberts
2009; Mapelli et al. 2009; Belczynski et al. 2010). Both of these
scenarios would require that many ULXs must be accreting matter
at or above the Eddington limit (e.g. Ohsuga & Mineshige 2011),
possibly with a degree of beaming further boosting their radiative
emission (e.g. King et al. 2001; Begelman et al. 2006; Poutanen
et al. 2007; King 2009). In at least two ULXs it has been possible
to constrain the mass of the compact object to within the stellar-
mass and massive stellar regimes (5–30 M(cid:12) in Liu et al. 2013 and
∼14 M(cid:12) in Motch et al. 2014), whilst in one other case the ﬁrst
robust evidence of a neutron star in a ULX has been reported (M82
X-2, Bachetti et al. 2014).

Amongst ULXs, those brighter than 1041 erg s−1 (e.g. HLX-1
in ESO 243-49; Farrell et al. 2009) are difﬁcult to explain within
this framework and are instead good candidates to host IMBHs
(102 − 105 M(cid:12); e.g. Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). These would be
accreting in the canonical sub-Eddington regimes, which produce
the observed states in Galactic XRBs (i.e. hard and soft states; e.g.

circle size is not indicative of the far smaller position error on the object.

McClintock & Remillard 2006; Fender & Belloni 2012). However,
potential formation and feeding mechanisms of IMBHs are still a
matter of debate. It has been suggested that they may originate from
either the collapse of primordial Population III stars (Madau &
Rees 2001); the dynamical collapse of supermassive stars forming
in the centre of very dense stellar super-clusters (Portegies Zwart
et al. 2004); grow from sMBHs that undergo repeated mergers in a
dense globular cluster (Miller & Hamilton 2002); or via a merger
with a dwarf galaxy that expelled a nuclear IMBH (Farrell et al.
2012; Mapelli et al. 2012). In all these scenarios ULX activity
can only start after the capture of a massive star, able to provide
the required mass transfer to power the extreme ULX luminosities
(e.g. Hopman et al. 2004; Mapelli et al. 2011). Hence, identifying
IMBHs is of crucial importance not only for simply proving their
existence and assessing these formation scenarios, but also due to
the likely implications for our understanding of the initial seeding
and subsequent growth of nuclear BHs in galaxies (Volonteri 2010).
High quality XMM-Newton X-ray spectra of ULXs with lu-
minosities lower than ∼ 2 × 1040 erg s−1 show ubiquitous spec-
tral curvature at moderately high energy (> 2 keV, Stobbart et al.
2006; Gladstone et al. 2009), often coupled to a soft excess of
∼ 0.1 − 0.4 keV. As these features are not commonly observed in
Galactic XRBs, they imply a new spectral regime, which is usually
referred to as the “ultraluminous state” (Roberts 2007; Gladstone
et al. 2009), and may be associated with super-Eddington accre-
tion. A few luminous ULXs have very recently been observed with
NuSTAR, resulting in spectra which demonstrate that the high en-
ergy curvature persists above 10 keV (Bachetti et al. 2013; Walton
et al. 2013; Rana et al. 2014), conﬁrming this result. The spec-
tral curvature may arise either from Comptonisation in a cold, opti-
cally thick corona lying above an accretion disc (e.g. Stobbart et al.
2006; Gladstone et al. 2009); from a modiﬁed accretion disc, i.e. a
slim disc (Mizuno et al. 2007); or the hot inner regions of the disc,
which are highly distorted by advection, turbulence, self-heating
and spin (Beloborodov 1998; Suleimanov et al. 2002; Kawaguchi
2003). The soft component is thought to originate from the photo-
sphere of a radiatively-driven wind that is ejected from the spher-
ization radius of the accretion disc down to its innermost regions,
which is expected to occur at super-Eddington accretion rates (e.g.
Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Poutanen et al. 2007; Ohsuga & Mi-
neshige 2007; Ohsuga et al. 2009). Partially-inhomogeneous winds
in ULXs may explain the puzzling short-term variability reported

in some ULXs (Heil et al. 2009), through a combination of inclina-
tion angle and accretion rate (e.g. Middleton et al. 2011; Takeuchi
et al. 2013; Middleton et al. 2015). These same factors also deter-
mine the observed energy spectrum (e.g. Sutton et al. 2013; Pintore
et al. 2014).

On the other hand, HLX-1 in ESO 243-49 (Farrell et al. 2009),
which has a peak luminosity of ∼ 1042 erg s−1, is observed with
a strikingly different set of properties than standard ULXs. It dis-
plays a spectral evolutionary pattern similar to that of the Galactic
BH X-ray transients (e.g. McClintock & Remillard 2006; Fender
& Belloni 2012), undergoing periodic outbursts (Godet et al. 2014;
Webb et al. 2014) in which the source switches from a high lu-
minosity soft state to a fainter hard state (Servillat et al. 2011).
Multi-wavelength emission has been detected from HLX-1 as it
undergoes this out-burst cycle. In particular, radio emission has
been detected, which is associated with discrete jet ejection events
(Webb et al. 2012), similar to those that have been observed dur-
ing hard-to-soft state transitions state in Galactic BHs. By assum-
ing that HLX-1 was in a similar state, the authors of that study
were able to reﬁne the BH mass estimates to ∼ 103 − 104 M(cid:12).
Other good IMBH candidates include: M82 X-1 (Feng et al. 2010),
for which a BH mass of ∼ 400 M(cid:12) has been suggested based on
the tentative identiﬁcation of twin-peak quasi periodic oscillations
(Pasham et al. 2014); and an X-ray source in the galaxy NGC 2276
(Mezcua et al. 2015). Also, a sub-sample of moderately-high lu-
minosity ULXs (LX >5×1040 erg s−1) show hard power-law like
spectra, with no high energy turn-off and short-term variability at
the level of ∼ 10% (Sutton et al. 2012). These sources may possi-
bly be IMBHs in a hard state, although their apparently ﬂat spectral
shape may simply be the result of poor counting statistics.

Walton et al. (2011) carried out a cross-correlation between
the 2XMM-DR3 and the RC3 catalogues, revealing a number of
new extreme ULXs (LX > 1040 erg s−1). The target of this study
(2XMM J143242.1−440939) is the nearest source from a prelim-
inary extension of that work (Earnshaw et al. in prep.). 2XMM
J143242.1−440939 is located in NGC 5643, which is an SAB(rs)c
galaxy with a low-luminosity Seyfert II nucleus and strong star for-
mation in its spiral arms (Phillips et al. 1983). NGC 5643 is at
a distance of d = 16.9 Mpc (Tully & Fisher 1988), and 2XMM
J143242.1-440939 (hereafter, NGC 5643 ULX1) is located 0.8 ar-
cminutes from its nucleus (Guainazzi et al. 2004; Figure 1). The
observed peak X-ray luminosity of NGC 5643 ULX1 is (cid:62) 1040 erg
s−1, although its historical ﬂux record shows it has varied in lumi-
nosity by a factor of ∼3–4 (see the following sections). Recent X-
ray observations with low counting statistics were consistent with it
having a hard power-law continuum spectrum (Γ ∼ 1.7, Guainazzi
et al. 2004; Matt et al. 2013) and short-term fractional variability
at the level of ∼ 10%. In this work we perform a spectral and
temporal analysis of all XMM-Newton observations of the source,
including our new very long observation taken on August 28 2014.
We make use of the high quality data from this XMM-Newton ob-
servation (∼ 100 ks) to test whether we can rule out either sub- or
super-Eddington accretion in NGC 5643 ULX1. Besides the ULX,
NGC 5643 hosts also an AGN (Guainazzi et al. 2004; Bianchi et al.
2006; Annuar et al. 2015). Results of the spectral analysis of the
AGN are also brieﬂy reported in and discussed in Appendix A.

The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we summarize
the data selection and reduction procedures, in Section 3 we present
the results of our timing and spectral analysis of NGC 5643 ULX1,
and in Section 4 we discuss the implications of these.

2 DATA REDUCTION

NGC 5643 ULX1 was observed once with both the ROSAT (Au-
gust 28 1997) and Chandra (December 26 2004) satellites, and
three times with XMM-Newton (see log in Table 1). In this work
we mainly focus on the XMM-Newton observations, but also brieﬂy
consider the Chandra data. The ROSAT dataset was largely ex-
cluded, as it was taken with the HRI detector, which has negligible
energy resolution.

The Chandra observation was reduced using the CIAO v.4.6
software adopting the standard procedures. In order to verify the
point-like nature of NGC 5643 ULX1, we used CHART and MARX
data analysis software to simulate the PSF for the observation at
the source position. We used ten times the real exposure time to
better sample the PSF. The CIAO tool srcextent was used to con-

ﬁrm that the source is not extended at 90% conﬁdence. However,
we found that the Chandra data were affected by ∼ 6% pile-up
(estimated with the CIAO v.4.6 software) and the data quality and
spectral properties of NGC 5643 ULX1 were comparable to that
of the XMM-Newton observation 2, thus do not provide signiﬁcant
additional information. Therefore, in the rest of this work we fo-
cus mainly on the XMM-Newton data. The observed ROSAT and
Chandra count rates are used only to estimate the unabsorbed lu-
minosity, assuming a power-law spectral shape with photon index
of 1.7 as was found from the low quality XMM-Newton data (see
below).

We carried out a spectral and temporal analysis on all the
available XMM-Newton observations (Table 1), which were taken
in Imaging mode, of NGC 5643 ULX1. The data sets were re-
duced using SAS v. 13.5.0 and the most recent EPIC calibrations.
After selecting good time intervals free of background ﬂares, we
extracted spectra and lightcurves from events with PATTERN(cid:54) 4
for EPIC-pn (which allows for single and double pixel events) and
PATTERN(cid:54) 12 for EPIC-MOS (which allows for single, double,
triple and quadruple pixel events). We set ‘FLAG=0’ in order to ex-
clude bad pixels and events coming from the CCD edges. EPIC-
MOS and pn source and background spectra were extracted from
20” radius circular regions (the latter on the same CCD where the
source is located and far from the read-out node). These were cho-
sen to be smaller than is typically used for XMM-Newton data in or-
der to reduce contamination by the nucleus of NGC 5643, which is

located ∼ 50(cid:48)(cid:48) from the ULX. Finally, we note that, in observation
2, NGC 5643 ULX1 was on a CCD gap of the EPIC-pn instrument,
as such we only analysed the EPIC-MOS data.

All of the extracted spectra were rebinned such that they had
at least 25 counts per bin so that they could be analysed using the
χ2 statistic. Spectral ﬁtting was performed using XSPEC v.12.8.2
(Arnaud 1996). For each observation, we ﬁtted the EPIC-pn (except
for observation 2) and both EPIC-MOS spectra simultaneously in
the 0.3–10 keV energy range. In all ﬁts, a multiplicative constant
was used to account for residual calibration differences between
the three instruments. The constant was ﬁxed to 1 for EPIC-pn and
allowed to vary for the EPIC-MOS spectra. In the case of observa-
tion 2, we ﬁxed the constant to 1 of the EPIC-MOS1 spectrum. In
general, the differences among the three instruments were less than
5%.

3 ANALYSIS OF THE ULX
3.1 High quality data

3.1.1 Timing analysis

We start by reporting results from observation 3, as it has the best
quality data. This observation caught NGC 5643 ULX1 in a con-
stant ﬂux state, with an average count rate in the EPIC-pn instru-
ment of ∼ 0.3 cts s−1 (Figure 2-bottom).

To check for short-term variability, we calculated the EPIC-
pn power spectral density (PSD) on the timescale of the longest
continuous segment in this observation (77 ks). There were no sig-
niﬁcant features in the PSD, indicating that the variability was con-
sistent with white noise. The upper limit to root mean square (rms)
variability of periodic signals in excess of the white noise, in the
frequency range 1.3 × 10−5 − 5.0 Hz, was 4.3% at the 90 per cent
conﬁdence level (c.l.). The conﬁdence levels refers to the proba-
bility (expressed in terms of the Gaussian probability distribution)
that the variability of a signal is lower than the reported threshold
(see van der Klis 1994). We also calculated PSDs in the 6 × 10−3–
1 Hz frequency range, which were averaged over 10 intervals and
linearly rebinned in frequency to 32 bins (Figure 3). Again, no sig-
niﬁcant variability was detected above the Poisson noise. We calcu-
lated the upper limit to the rms of the signal in the frequency range
1.3 × 10−4 − 1 Hz to be 10.4% at the 90.0 % c.l..

Finally, because no short-term variability was detected above
the Poisson noise, we also estimated the 3σ upper limit on the rms
fractional variability (e.g. Vaughan et al. 2003) to be <9%, in the
timescale 100s–77ks. For a direct comparison with observation 1
(see section 3.2), we also estimated the rms fractional variability
on timescales 100s-8000s, ﬁnding a 3σ upper limit of ∼ 3%.

3.1.2

Spectral analysis

The ﬁrst stage of our spectral analysis was to look for short-term
spectral variability during the long observation. We extracted light
curves with 500s binning in the 0.3–1.5 and 1.5–10 keV energy
ranges, which were selected such that there were similar count rates
in each band. The ratios of the corresponding light curves are con-
sistent with being constant (∼ 1) at 3σ signiﬁcance. As such, we
analyse the time-averaged X-ray spectrum from the entire observa-
tion.

We initially ﬁtted the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra with a
power-law absorbed by neutral material. We considered two neu-
tral absorbers (modeled with TBABS in XSPEC), one ﬁxed to

Figure 3. PSD of observation 3 averaged over 10 intervals and rebinned by
a factor of 32, evaluated in the frequency range 6 × 10−3 − 1 Hz. Poisson
noise (Leahy normalisation) has a constant power of 2 (green solid line).
No coherent signals or signiﬁcant temporal variability is found above the
Poisson noise.

the Galactic value in the direction of the ULX (8 × 1020 cm−2;
Kalberla et al. 2005), and the other free to vary to model absorption
close to the ULX. Although this resulted in a statistically accept-
able ﬁt (χ2 of 1002 for 936 degrees of freedom, with parameters
given in Table 2), the power-law model resulted in hard residuals.
Using the CFLUX convolution pseudo-model we estimated the un-
absorbed X-ray luminosity to be ∼ 4× 1040 erg s−1 (for a distance
of 16.9 Mpc). The large ﬁt statistic is mainly due to a clear roll-
over at energies higher than 5 keV that cannot be reproduced by a
power-law (see the residuals in Figure 4-top-left). To test the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of the high energy roll-over we followed the
method of Stobbart et al. (2006), and compared a power-law and
a broken power-law (BKNPOWER in XSPEC) model ﬁtted to the
> 2 keV spectra. We found that a BKNPOWER ﬁt with the two
photon indexes tied together is statistically acceptable (χ2/dof =
506.31/423) but a signiﬁcant improvement in the ﬁt (∆χ2 = 103.54
for 2 additional dof) is found by allowing them to vary. The broken
power-law ﬁt provided a clearly superior description, with a F-test
probability of < 3 × 10−18 that the improvement was due to a
random ﬂuctuations in an intrinsic power-law spectrum.

In the sub-Eddington hard state XRBs exhibit both high levels
of short-term variability (larger than 10%) and a hard power-law
spectrum (e.g. McClintock & Remillard 2006). As such, the detec-
tion of a high energy break and the absence of short term variability
allow us to robustly conclude that NGC 5643 ULX1 was not in the
sub-Eddington hard state during observation 3. To test whether it
may have been in the sub-Eddington soft state we also ﬁtted the
spectra with an absorbed multicolour disc (DISKBB; Mitsuda et al.
1984), ﬁnding that this resulted in a statistically poorer ﬁt than the
power-law (χ2/dof = 1221/936). This excludes the possibility
that ULX1 was in the sub-Eddington soft state.

Next, we considered a multicolour disc added to the power-
law model. Adopting this two-component model, we found a good
ﬁt with a hot disc (∼ 2 keV) with the power-law dominating at low
energies (∆χ2 = 117.45 for 2 additional dof with respect to a sin-
gle power-law; see Table 2). Additionally, a cool disc (0.13 keV)
and a powerlaw results in an improved ﬁt over a power-law alone,

dominated disc (DISKPBB) or a single Comptonisation model (COMPTT).

although this is at lower signiﬁcance than the hot disc (∆χ2 = 20.7
for 2 additional dof, χ2/dof= 981/934). Although this is statis-
tically acceptable, residuals can be clearly seen at energies > 5
keV (Figure 4-top-right). Furthermore, when combined with the
cool disc the power-law has a photon index of Γ ∼ 1.8, which is
inconsistent with the steep powerlaw state seen in Galactic BHs
(Γ > 2.2).

Based on the spectral analysis of observation 3, we are able
to conclude that NGC 5643 ULX1 was not in any of the canonical
sub-Eddington spectral states seen in Galactic BHs. Hence, based
on the assumption that sub-Eddington IMBHs would be in the same
accretion states as Galactic XRBs (albeit with some rescaling to
account for the BH mass), we may strongly rule-out the possibility
that NGC 5643 ULX1 contains an IMBH. Furthermore, the degen-
eracy between hot and cool accretion discs when ﬁtting the spectra
with the two-component multicolour disc plus power-law model is
not unusual in ULXs and it has been investigated in the past (e.g.
Stobbart et al. 2006). Therefore, the spectral properties of NGC
5643 ULX1 appear to be consistent with the standard ULX popula-
tion. As such, we attempted to classify NGC 5643 ULX1 using the
multicolour disc plus power-law model, according to the scheme
proposed by Sutton et al. (2013). Since we found two statistical
minima for this model (i.e. a hot or a cold disc model), we may
classify the source as being in either the broadened-disc state or
the hard-ultraluminous state. However, the minimum with a hot
disc was statistically preferable, suggesting that NGC 5643 ULX1
is best classiﬁed as a broadened-disc source (although see Section 4
for caveats with this interpretation).

To further investigate the spectral properties of the source, par-
ticularly the high energy cut-off, we adopted several more spectral
models. The ﬁrst of these was a single power-law with an exponen-
tial cut-off (CUTOFFPL in XSPEC). This model strongly improved
the ﬁt statistic compared to the standard power-law (∆χ2= 109.45

for 1 additional dof, Figure 4-centre-left) and strongly reduced the
high energy residuals. The best ﬁtting model parameters were an
intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density of 4×1020 cm−2 and a
power-law photon index of 1.1, which broke at ∼ 5.5 keV. Similar
ﬁts are not unusual for ULXs (e.g. Gladstone et al. 2009). However,
this model is phenomenological. In terms of more physical models,
the spectrum of NGC 5643 ULX1 can be well described by both an
advection-dominated slim disc (DISKPBB1; e.g. Mineshige et al.
1994) and a Comptonisation model (COMPTT; Titarchuk 1994).
Both models are statistically acceptable (see Table 2) and show that
a broad, thermal-like component was a good description of the en-
tire 0.3–10 keV spectrum.
The best ﬁtting parameters for the DISKPBB model gave an
intrinsic neutral column density of 6 × 1020 cm−2 and a disc tem-
perature of 2.6 keV. However, this temperature is clearly high and
unusual with respect to those observed in Galactic BHs (McClin-
tock & Remillard 2006). Additionally, the value of the p parameter
suggests that the disc has to be signiﬁcantly advection dominated
(p=0.60 ± 0.01) and hence that the accretion rate in the disc is
likely super-Eddington. From this model we infer a 0.3–10 keV
unabsorbed luminosity of 3.8 × 1040 erg s−1 (ﬂux of 1.2 × 10−12
erg s−1 cm−2). Alternatively, the Comptonisation model resulted
in a column density of 8 × 1020 cm−2 (consistent with the pre-
vious model within the uncertainties) and corresponded to a cold,
optically thick corona (τ ∼ 10 and kTe ∼ 2 keV), fed by seed
photons with a temperature of 0.1 keV. The estimated unabsorbed
luminosity is consistent with that found with the DISKPBB model.
We note that a few 0.3–10 keV spectra of high luminosity ULXs

the disc radius), with p = 0.75 corresponding to a standard (Shakura &
Sunyaev 1973) disc, and p = 0.5 to an advection dominated slim disc (e.g.
Kawaguchi 2003).

(> 1040 erg s−1) can be also described by only a single component
model, such as Comptoniation or an advection dominated disc (e.g.
IC 342 X-1, Gladstone et al. 2009, although see Sutton et al. 2013
for caveats about this interpretation).

It has been suggested that the hard spectral component ob-
served in ULXs may originate from an optically thick corona
above the accretion disc, or from the inner disc itself (e.g. Stob-
bart et al. 2006; Gladstone et al. 2009). High quality X-ray spectra
of luminous ULXs can often be well-ﬁtted by a two-component
model consisting of Comptonisation and another soft component.
Here, the soft component is associated with an optically thick wind
ejected by the disc when the accretion rate locally exceeds the
Eddington limit (e.g. Poutanen et al. 2007; Ohsuga et al. 2009;
Takeuchi et al. 2014). The Comptonisation component originates
from the hot, inner accretion disc (e.g. Middleton et al. 2011; Ka-
java et al. 2012; Middleton et al. 2015). However, if both compo-
nents are present in NGC 5643 ULX1 and the inclination angle is
suitable (see e.g. Middleton et al. 2015), then we would expect to
observe both of these features in its spectrum. Hence, although it
is not required by the data, we tentatively added a multicolour disc
component to the Comptonisation model. This does not result in
a statistically signiﬁcant improvement (∆χ2 ∼ 2 for 2 additional

dof), and the parameters of the corona are consistent with those
derived from the single component model. However, the tempera-
ture of the soft component (∼ 0.3 keV) is in line with what found
in many other ULXs (e.g. Stobbart et al. 2006; Gladstone et al.
2009; Sutton et al. 2013; Pintore et al. 2014; Middleton et al. 2014;
Walton et al. 2013; Bachetti et al. 2014). We note instead that the
column density is poorly constrained and that the soft component is
very weak and represents only a marginal fraction of the total ﬂux
(∼ 6%).

Finally, we highlight that irrespective of the adopted model,
small structured residuals are still observed at the energies of 6–7
keV and 8 keV. The former is probably caused by a small, resid-
ual contamination from the nearby AGN (which has a strong iron
emission complex; see Appendix A) in both source spectrum and
background.

The spectra extracted from observations 1 and 2 have only mod-
erate numbers of counts in comparison to observation 3. They can
only be used to constrain simple models, and do not provide any
further signiﬁcant evidence for high energy spectral curvature.

Fabio Pintore

The energy spectrum extracted from observation 1 can be well
described by either an absorbed power-law (χ2/dof=102.46/93) or
a DISKPBB (χ2/dof=100.86/92; see Table 2 and Figure 5-top), al-
though a multicolour disc is statistically rejected at 3σ signiﬁcance
(χ2/dof=137.84/93). A Comptonisation model provides an ade-
quate ﬁt to the data (χ2/dof=100.76/98), but most of the spectral
parameters (column density, electron temperature and seed photons
temperature) are unconstrained. The single powerlaw results in a
photon index of 1.7, and a neutral column of 1.1 × 1021 cm−2.
The DISKPBB model indicates a very hot inner disc temperature
(3.6 keV), which is consistent with that found for observation 3.
Similarly, the p-index (0.56+0.04−0.03) suggests an advection dominated
disc, indicating that the source is accreting at above the Eddington
limit. Finally, both the neutral absorption (8 × 1020 cm−2) and
unabsorbed luminosity (∼ 4 × 1040 erg s−1) are consistent with
observation 3.

Observation 1 did not contain sufﬁcient counts to calculate
a meaningful PDS, although we were able to calculate the rms
fractional variability. This was done in the time domain, with
lightcurves binned to 100 s in order to accrue sufﬁcient counts in
each bin. We estimated the 0.3–10 keV fractional variability to be
15 ± 4% (on timescales of 100s–8000s, i.e. where the duration of
8000s refers to the longest continuous segment of the observation).
This value is higher than the upper-limit from observation 3 but
they are both consistent within the 3σ uncertainties. Furthermore,
despite the poor quality data of observation 1, the ﬂuxes of observa-
tions 1 and 3 appear to be comparable (Figure 2-top-left) and their
spectra broadly similar.

The observation 2 spectrum (Figure 2-top-right) is also well
ﬁtted by a single absorbed power-law model (χ2/dof=21.65/22;
Γ ∼ 1.7, NH < 8 × 1020 cm−2). This has an unabsorbed lu-
minosity of ∼ 1.7 × 1040 erg s−1, hence represents a signiﬁ-
cant drop in ﬂux from the other observations. Again, the spectrum
can also be well ﬁtted by a DISKPBB (χ2/dof=21.18/21; see Ta-
ble 2 and Figure 5-bottom), although some of the parameters are
poorly constrained. As with observation 1, a multicolour disc can
be strongly rejected (χ2/dof=50.99/22). For completeness, we also
investigated whether the change in luminosity could be dependent
on the column density. To test this, we adopted the DISKPBB model
and ﬁxed NH to 0.6 × 1021 cm−2 (i.e. the best ﬁt value of the
DISKPBB model when ﬁtted to the spectrum from observations 3).
This test conﬁrmed that the factor of 2-3 luminosity variability was
not driven by changes in the absorption column. By stacking the
MOS1 and MOS2 lightcurves we were only able to place an upper
limit on the 0.3–10 keV rms fractional variability (on timescales
100s–12800s) of ∼ 27% (estimated with the ftools LCSTATS).

We followed two approaches to test where the observation
1 and 2 spectra were consistent with that from observation 3.
Firstly, we simultaneously ﬁtted the EPIC-pn (where available) and
EPIC-MOS spectra from all three of the observations with either a
DISKPBB or a COMPTT model. The spectral parameters were ﬁxed
to the best-ﬁtting values from observation 3, and only normalisation
was free to vary between the observations. This resulted in a statis-
tically acceptable ﬁt (χ2/dof=623.49/637), strongly indicating that
the spectral properties of the ULX remained unchanged between
the observations. In addition, we note that the normalisation of the
model in observations 2 is, as previously found, more than a fac-
tor of 2 lower than those in observation 1 and 3, conﬁrming the
existence of ﬂux variability between the datasets. The second ap-
proach was to create a simulated spectrum based on the parameters
of the best-ﬁtting model from observation 3. The simulated expo-
sure time was chosen such that it was comparable to observations

1 and 2. The spectrum was then ﬁtted with an absorbed power-law,
obtaining a statistically acceptable ﬁt, with a spectral index that
was indistinguishable from observations 1 and 2 (Γ ∼1.7). Based
on both of these tests we can conclude that the the source does not
display long-term spectral variability, despite changing in its X-ray
luminosity.

4 DISCUSSION

NGC 5643 ULX1 is a luminous ULX that is associated with the
galaxy NGC 5643, which is at a distance at 16.9 Mpc. The source
was initially identiﬁed using ROSAT/HRI data (Guainazzi et al.
2004) at a luminosity of ∼ 1040 erg s−1. It was subsequently
detected by Chandra and XMM-Newton with luminosities of ∼1–
4×1040 erg s−1, indicating the ULX exhibited long-term ﬂux vari-
ability up to a factor of 2–3 (Figure 6). We note that it is unlikely
that this object is a background quasi-stellar object (QSO) as it
does not have any detected optical counterpart in the DSS (down
to mV ∼ 20), in a short VLT/FORS1 exposure (down to a compa-
rable magnitude). An optical counterpart would likely be detected
in these observations if the source were a QSO with an observed
X-ray ﬂux of ∼ 1 × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 (0.3–10 keV). We can
place a lower-limit on the (0.3–3.5 keV) X-ray to optical ﬂux ratio
of ∼15, which is above the typical range of fX /fV seen in most
AGNs (0.1-10; e.g. Maccacaro et al. 1988). This is further sup-
ported by the lack of a detection of any potential counterpart to the
ULX in infrared 2MASS and WISE images of the ﬁeld.

NGC 5643 ULX1 was considered an intriguing source be-
cause, in low quality data, it appeared to show X-ray properties
reminiscent of an IMBH accreting at sub-Eddington rates. Here
we instead report that during a long XMM-Newton observation,
the ULX had a spectrum which could be well modelled either in
terms of a cold, optically thick Comptonizing corona or a very hot
(2.5–3 keV), advection dominated disc. The high energy roll-over
was further conﬁrmed by a NuSTAR observation of the source (An-
nuar et al. 2015), indicating that the spectral shape of NGC 5643
ULX1 was more complex than the single powerlaw as found in low-
quality data. Furthermore, it is important to note that we observed

without signiﬁcant spectral changes.

It is worth-noting that for most of the ULX population, the X-
ray data are of poor quality and the paucity of the counting statistics
can lead to an incorrect or uncertain interpretation of their nature.
This was the case of NGC 5643 ULX1. The properties showed
by NGC 5643 ULX1 are not unusual for the ULXs. Indeed, a
number of other ULXs showed similar degeneracies between spec-
tral shape, luminosity and short-term variability when comparing
low and high quality data, and it has been proposed that these
ULXs may be sMBHs or massive stellar BHs accreting at super-
Eddington rates (e.g. Stobbart et al. 2006; Roberts 2007; Gladstone
et al. 2009; Heil et al. 2009; Middleton et al. 2011; Sutton et al.
2013; Pintore et al. 2014; Middleton et al. 2015). If the power-law-
dominated spectra of NGC 5643 ULX1 are indeed simply due to
the poor data quality and the intrinsic spectra are actually similar to
the highest quality observation, then the marginally different lev-
els of short-term variability could be explained by the effects of
an outﬂow ejected by the accretion disc at radii where it is locally
super-Eddington (Poutanen et al. 2007; Ohsuga & Mineshige 2011;
Takeuchi et al. 2014). If the wind is turbulent, it could increase the
short-term variability when our line of sight encounters turbulences
in the wind (Takeuchi et al. 2014; Middleton et al. 2015). Therefore,
if we believe to the very marginally different short-term variability
observed at the same luminosity in two XMM-Newton observations
of this source, it could be explained as a substantial difference in
homogeneity of the wind itself (Middleton et al. 2015). However,
we note that if the outﬂow/wind extends above the whole disc, we
may expect to observe its photosphere in the form of a cold thermal
component.

If it is indeed a standard ULX, the spectral properties of NGC
5643 ULX1 may be associated with the broadened disc classiﬁca-
tion proposed by Sutton et al. (2013). However, we note that this
classiﬁcation may be ambiguous given the observed high X-ray
luminosity and intermittent short-term variability, and this source
could potentially be associated with the hard ultraluminous class.
This could be the case if the source is seen close to face-on. We sug-
gest that the X-ray spectrum could be dominated by the hard emis-
sion component, which is ampliﬁed by beaming in the funnel of the
wind and scattered on the wind photosphere (e.g. Middleton et al.
2015). In such conditions the soft spectral component may be sup-
pressed, allowing the hard component to dominate, giving a harder
spectrum (e.g. Sutton et al. 2013, Sutton et al. 2013b). This scenario
cannot be distinguished from an advection dominated disc, but we
note that very marginal indications of a soft component are evident
when the highest quality spectra are ﬁtted with the multicolour disc
plus Comptonisation model. Recently, a few other ULXs with lumi-
nosities > 1040 erg s−1 have been reported to have single compo-
nent, disc-like spectra (Circinus ULX5, NGC 5907 ULX1; Walton
et al. 2013; Sutton et al. 2013), including one HLX candidate in
the galaxy NGC 470, which appears to be disc-like when it is most
luminous (Sutton et al. 2012). Similarly, several other well-studied
lower luminosity ULXs have been reported to become spectrally
harder with increasing luminosity (the NGC 1313 X-2 when it has
a ‘very thick’ spectra, Pintore & Zampieri 2012; Holmberg IX X-1,
Vierdayanti et al. 2010, Luangtip et al. submitted). The feasibility
of this scenario is seemingly conﬁrmed by Kawashima et al. (2012),
who used Monte-Carlo simulations to simulate radiation spectra
from supercritical BH accretion ﬂows. They showed that a source
accreting at the highest super-Eddington rates, where the wind en-
velope can cover the whole object and down-scatter the photons
emitted in the hot inner regions, could appear with similar spectral

properties to NGC 5643 ULX1 when viewed close to face-on. This
may naturally explain the (marginally) increased short-term vari-
ability in observation 1, whereas the potential origin of variability
in a simple advection dominated disc is unclear. However, high lev-
els of short-variability are generally seen in ULXs with a soft spec-
tral shape, rather than hard sources such as NGC 5643 ULX1 (e.g.
Sutton et al. 2013). As such, we can speculate that in NGC 5643
ULX1 the wind does not completely cover the disc, but the hard
component is beamed by the wind funnel so still dominates the ob-
served spectrum. In this case, if clumps of wind material are blown
in to the funnel and intersect our line of sight, they could feasibly
produce the observed short-term variability.

Based on the similarities between this source and NGC 1313
X-2, we tentatively estimated the mass of the compact object us-
ing the hardness-intensity diagrams from Pintore et al. (2014). As
NGC 5643 ULX1 displays similar spectral hardness to NGC 1313
X-2, we suggest that they may be accreting at similar fractions of
Eddington. As NGC 5643 ULX1 is a factor of ∼ 4 more luminous
than NGC 1313 X-2, for the same spectral hardness, we suggest
that the BH in NGC 5643 ULX1 is also ∼4 times larger than that
in NGC 1313 X-2. Indeed, at a luminosity of 4× 1040 erg s−1, this
ULX is consistent with containing a ∼30 M(cid:12) BH which is emit-
ting at ∼10 times the Eddington limit (cf. Poutanen et al. 2007).
This proposed scenario could be tested using further moderately
long (∼40 ks) combined XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations,
which could trace the evolution of the source.

We must caution that the distance to the galaxy (hence the
ULX distance as well) may be over estimated in this and previ-
ous work. Sanders et al. (2003) estimated a distance of 13.9 Mpc,
based on the assumption of the cosmic attractor model (Mould et al.
2000). At this distance the luminosities of ULX1 would be reduced
by ∼30%. This would mean that the ULX is less extreme in lu-
minosity than previously reported and possibly more similar to the
bulk population of typical ULXs in the nearby Universe (e.g. Glad-
stone et al. 2009; Middleton et al. 2011; Vierdayanti et al. 2010;
Pintore & Zampieri 2012; Sutton et al. 2013; Pintore et al. 2014;
Middleton et al. 2015; Walton et al. 2013; Bachetti et al. 2013).
This would imply that our previous highly tentative mass estimate
for the black hole relative to NGC 1313 X-2 should be lowered to
a factor of ∼2–3.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have analysed all of the available XMM-Newton observations of
the SAB(rs)c galaxy NGC 5643, with the primary purpose of study-
ing ULX1. This is an improvement over previous work, as for the
ﬁrst time we report results from a new observation with unprece-
dented data quality for this source. The ULX is particularly lumi-
nous (> 1040 erg s−1) and has an energy spectrum that can be re-
produced by models of an advection dominated disc or a Compton-
ising corona, without showing signiﬁcant spectral variability. Such
a thermal-like spectral state is not seen in Galactic sub-Eddington
accreting BH binaries, where soft spectra are generally well ﬁtted
by a standard Shakura & Sunyaev accretion disc (Shakura & Sun-
yaev 1973). In addition, the short-term variability of this source ap-
pears to (very marginally) vary independently of the luminosity of
the ULX. These results have allowed us to rule-out canonical sub-
Eddington spectral states (i.e. sub-Eddington hard and soft states)
which would be expected if the ULX contained an IMBH. Instead,
we favour an interpretation of this source as BH of stellar origin ac-
creting at super-Eddington rates. In particular, we suggest that the

10

source may be seen almost face-on, with a strong outﬂow which
beams and ampliﬁes the hard emission produced in the inner disc.
This is equivalent to the hard/ultraluminous state proposed by Sut-
ton et al. (2013) for the highest luminosity ULXs. This scenario can
not only produce the hard spectral shape seen in this ULX, but if
the wind is turbulent, it also naturally explains the observed random
short-term variability. Based on this interpretation, we tentatively
estimate the mass of the BH in this system to be ∼ 30 M(cid:12).

APPENDIX A: SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF THE AGN

Besides the ULX, NGC 5643 hosts also an AGN. The AGN is
known to be heavily absorbed and characterised by a large iron
emission feature, probably associated with Compton reﬂection of
hard photons (e.g. Guainazzi et al. 2004; Bianchi et al. 2006; An-
nuar et al. 2015). Other emission features have also been found
in the XMM-Newton spectra of the AGN, and these have been as-
sociated with photoionised emission regions. Annuar et al. (2015)
studied a combination of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data with
the aim of well characterising the spectral properties of the AGN.
They found that different reﬂection/obscuration models can well
describe the data, indicating that both Compton thick absorption
by a toroidal absorber and reﬂection from distant, cold material
are important in explaining the AGNs spectral properties. However,

the properties of all of the components are still a matter of debate,
and with the recent long XMM-Newton observation we have an un-
precedented chance to study these features in high quality data at
low energies (< 3 keV).

We extracted the spectrum of the AGN in observation 3,
choosing extraction regions of 20(cid:48)(cid:48) and 40(cid:48)(cid:48) for the AGN and the
background, respectively. The spectra clearly show a prominent
emission line 6.4 keV, plus many other emission features. Simple
models, such as a blackbody plus a power-law or APEC plasma
emission plus a power-law result in poor ﬁts and broadband resid-
uals. Instead we found that the XMM-Newton continuum spec-
trum can be well ﬁtted by the combination of a neutral absorbed
powerlaw, a reﬂection component (modelled with REFLIONX, Ross
& Fabian e.g. 2007) and a photoionised plasma (APEC model in
XSPEC). We ﬁxed the chemical abundance of both the reﬂection
and APEC plasma components to 1, and left the photon indices
of the power-law and the ionising ﬂux for the reﬂection compo-
nent free to vary independently. This three-component model pro-
vides an improvement in the ﬁt to the data (χ2/dof=941/589, see
Table A1), with respect to the simpler models mentioned above,
and the iron emission line is well modelled, allowing us to asso-
ciate it with reﬂection. The neutral column density is ∼ 0.4× 1022
cm−2, which is intermediate between values reported for the pre-
vious XMM-Newton observations (e.g. Guainazzi et al. 2004; Matt
et al. 2013), but signiﬁcantly lower than the value reported by An-
nuar et al. (2015). The power-law has a photon index of ∼ 5 and
can adequately reproduce the soft part of the spectrum with the ad-
ditional contribution from the ∼ 0.8 keV APEC plasma. The very
ﬂat powerlaw photon index would give an unusually low Comp-
ton y parameter; hence it may actually suggest that this compo-
nent represents the tail of a thermal component which is outside
of the XMM-Newton bandpass. The reﬂection component mainly
contributes to the high energy spectrum. From the inferred parame-
ters, we can conclude that reﬂection occurs in a very-low ionisation
medium (ξ ∼ 20 erg cm s−1) illuminated by an ionising ﬂux with
a ﬂat photon index. We note that the photon index is pegged at the
lower limit allowed by the REFLIONX model (Γ = 1.4), although
this may depend on the uncertainties in the illuminating emission,
which is probably above the XMM-Newton bandpass. Hence we
cannot exclude the possibility that the ionising ﬂux spectrum is
even ﬂatter.

Emission lines are still evident as residuals in the spectrum.
These include: moderately broad (σ < 70 eV) emission lines at
0.32±0.3 keV, 1.73±0.1 keV and 3.05±0.5 keV (with equivalent
widths, EWs, of ∼400 eV, ∼150 eV and ∼180 eV), associated with
the neutral Kα transition of C, Si and Ar, and three broad (σ ∼250
eV) emission features 2.29±0.8 keV, 3.8±0.1 keV and 7.00±0.7
keV (with EWs of 520 eV, 220 eV and 500 eV respectively), as-
sociated with neutral Kα transitions of N and Ca, and the highly
ionised Fe XXVI Kα line respectively (see Figure A1). The best
ﬁtting model that includes the emission lines results in a ﬁt statis-
tic of χ/dof = 687/571, which is formally acceptable (see ta-
ble A1). We suggest that the C, Si, Ar, Ca and N lines are related
to the reﬂection component which produces the intense 6.4 keV Fe
emission line, whilst the Fe XXVI emission line may be generated
in a very ionised region close to the central supermassive BH. We
infer a 0.3–10 keV unabsorbed luminosity of 3×1041 erg s−1, thus
conﬁrming that the source is a low luminosity AGN (e.g. Guainazzi
et al. 2004; Matt et al. 2013; Annuar et al. 2015).

The spectral analysis shows that the AGN has a complex spec-
tral shape that can be well modelled in the soft band by a pho-
toionised plasma and a steep power-law with photon index of 5.

(almost neutral). Some broad emission features are also observed,
which we identify as Kα neutral transitions of C, Si, Ar, Ca and
N. These emission features are probably associated with the same
reﬂection processes which dominate the high energy continuum
emission. The broadening (up to 0.3 keV) could be caused by either
scatterings in a high-velocity medium, thermal Compton scattering
or by relativistic effects. Our results are consistent with the broad-
band spectral study presented by Annuar et al. (2015), who found
that a combination of highly Compton thick absorption (> 1024
cm−2) and cold reﬂection are at work in this source. The 2.0–10
keV unabsorbed luminosity found in observation 3 (∼ 2.5 × 1040
erg s−1) is clearly lower than the 0.8− 1.7× 1042 erg s−1 reported
by Annuar et al. (2015), and we relate this discrepancy to both the
signiﬁcantly lower absorption column found in this work and to
possible real slight variation in the X-ray luminosity. Annuar et al.
(2015) showed that a model which take into account only reﬂec-
tion converges towards low values of the column density. Instead,
a combination of toroidal absorption and reﬂection may result in
more reliable estimates of the column density.

The plasma emission has a temperature of ∼ 0.8 keV and an unab-
sorbed 0.3–10 keV luminosity of ∼3×1039 erg s−1, and may orig-
inate from gas heated by shocks or winds in regions of intense star
formation (Guainazzi et al. 2004). These two components could be
associated with an optically thin medium located close to the X-ray
source, in which the tail of a cold thermal component from outside
of the XMM-Newton bandpass is reprocessed, mainly through pho-
toelectric absorption. The hard energy band is dominated by a re-
ﬂection component that appears to be produced by the scattering of
hard photons (with a spectral index of 1.4) in a low-ionised medium
