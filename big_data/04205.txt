Abstract

We propose that the TeV scale mirage mediation in the Next-to-Minimal Su-
persymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is a novel solution for the little hierarchy
problem in supersymmetry. The 125 GeV Higgs boson can be accommodated with
the new quartic coupling or the mixing with the singlet. The ﬁne-tuning measures
are estimated numerically and found as low as 10% or below for 1.5 TeV gluino and
1 TeV stop. The higgsino can be as heavy as 500 GeV without deteriorating the
ﬁne-tuning. An undesirable singlet-doublet mixing in the Higgs sector is suppressed
due to approximate scale symmetries. We investigate the couplings of the Higgs
bosons and discuss the prospects for studying them at LHC and ILC.

Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a promising candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model
(SM). It stabilizes the big hierarchy between the Planck scale and the electroweak scale
(1 part in 1032 for the squared mass scale). Furthermore, the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the SM (MSSM) predicts a precise gauge coupling uniﬁcation.
It is also
equipped with a natural candidate of the dark matter. In 2012, ATLAS and CMS collab-
orations discovered the Higgs boson, the last missing piece of the SM [2, 3]. Its mass is
125 GeV [4], which means that the self-coupling of the Higgs boson is perturbative. This
perfectly matches with the prediction of the minimal SUSY.

SUSY is such a wonderful theory with full of conceptual successes. However, now it
is facing with an annoying ’little ﬁne-tuning problem’. LHC Run I has ﬁnished and it
did not ﬁnd any sign of the colored SUSY particles. The lower bound of the mass of the
gluino is now roughly 1.4 TeV. Those of the ﬁrst/second generation squarks and the third
generation squarks are about 1 TeV and 700 GeV in simpliﬁed models (for example see,
[5]). Among them, the masses of the gluino and stops are mixed up with m2
Hu, the SUSY
breaking mass parameter of the Higgs boson, via the renormalization group evolution.
Without ﬁne-tuning the initial conditions, they are expected to be similar in their sizes.
While in the MSSM, the Z boson mass, mZ which represents the scale of the electroweak
breaking is determined as,

with 1/ tan β expansion. Here µ is the SUSY preserving higgsino mass whose origin is
in most cases diﬀerent from m2
Hu. This means that mZ = 91 GeV is the result of a
ﬁne-tuning between m2
Hu and µ2 worse than 1%. A possible solution of this problem is
a SUSY breaking mediation mechanism which, with some underlying reasons, exactly
realizes m2
Z) at the electroweak scale, simultaneously with the gluino and stops
as heavy as O(1) TeV or more (little SUSY hierarchy). TeV scale mirage mediation is
proposed as one of such mechanisms [6, 7][8]. In the MSSM, it alleviates the problem
considerably, however, suﬀers from several problems, in particular after the discovery of
the Higgs boson. In this talk, we argue that the TeV scale mirage mediation in the Next-
to-Minimal SUSY SM (NMSSM) provides a novel solution for this little SUSY hierarchy
problem and discuss its phenomenology focusing on the precision Higgs measurement
[9, 1]1.

2 TeV scale mirage mediation in NMSSM

The mirage mediation is a SUSY breaking mediation mechanism based on supergravity
[11][12][13]. It is inspired by the KKLT ﬂux string compactiﬁcation [14], however, not

necessarily assumes strict string realizations. It is a combination of well-known two mech-
anisms, the modulus mediation [15] and the anomaly mediation [16]. The order parameter
of the former is the modulus mediated gaugino mass, M0 and that of the latter is the
gravitino mass m3/2. The modulus mediation is a tree-level eﬀect in supergravity, while
the anomaly mediation works at loop-level. Thus, the latter is negligible if M0 ∼ m3/2.
However, the KKLT type modulus stabilization predicts M0 ∼ m3/2/(4π)2 and both of
them give the leading eﬀect [11]. The important feature of the mirage mediation is the
mirage uniﬁcation [12]. The renormalization group corrections to the modulus medi-
ated SUSY breaking cancel with the anomaly mediation at the mirage uniﬁcation scale,
Mmir = MGU T /(Mpl/m3/2)α/2 at one-loop level. Then, the boundary conditions for the
modulus mediation appear at Mmir, not at the uniﬁcation scale. α is essentially given by
the ratio of M0 and m3/2, α = m3/2/M0 ln(Mpl/m3/2). It is determined by the scaling di-
mension of the uplifting potential against the modulus ﬁeld in supergravity. Considering
its underlying geometrical origin, α is not arbitrary but typically given by a ratio of small
integers. If α = 2, the boundary conditions for the modulus mediation appear around the
electroweak scale. They are given by,

given by a ratio of small integers again reﬂecting a geometrical origin of φi. In addition, we
also have uncontrollable threshold corrections depending on the detail of the UV theory
[17]. For the cancellation of the renormalization group running, a sum rule, ci +cj +ck = 1
is required for non-negligible Yukawa coupling constants, Yijk ∼ O(1). If the UV theory
chooses cHu = 0, we obtain the desired little hierarchy at the electroweak scale up to the
threshold corrections and 2-loop eﬀects in the renormalization group running. This is the
TeV scale mirage mediation scenario.

TeV scale mirage mediation can considerably ameliorate the little SUSY hierarchy
problem, however, it has two problems in the MSSM. The ﬁrst problem is the Bµ problem
inherent with the model based on the anomaly mediation. The B term which appears in
the Higgs potential has a tree-level contribution of the order of m3/2 >> M0. Thus, we
need a delicate cancellation with another contribution to realize B ∼ M0 [12][18]. The

boson with M0 (cid:39) 1 TeV because the A-term for the top Yukawa coupling is ﬁxed by the
sum rule. The extension to the NMSSM can solve these two problems.

In the NMSSM, we introduce a singlet supermultiplet S to the MSSM [19][20, 21].

2Here we neglect the possibility of the ﬂavor mixing among the sfermions

κS3,

(2.3)

where we impose Z3 symmetry to forbid liner and quadratic terms of S and Hd,u. To
eliminate the domain wall formed in the early Universe 3, Z3 symmetry must be broken
by some higher dimensional operators. We also have the Yukawa couplings of quarks
and leptons as in the MSSM. In the following, we will use the same notation for the
supermultiplet and its scalar component. After the scalar component of S develops a
vacuum expectation value (VEV), the Higgs ﬁelds obtain the eﬀective µ term, µ = λ(cid:104)S(cid:105).
The size of (cid:104)S(cid:105) is controlled by the soft SUSY breaking terms. Thus as is well known, µ
problem in the MSSM is solved in the NMSSM [23]. The B term of the MSSM is also
replaced with Aλ and its size is the order of M0 in the mirage mediation. Then the ﬁrst
(Bµ) problem of the mirage mediation is solved [6]. In the NMSSM, we have a new quartic
coupling, λ2|HdHu|2 in the Higgs potential. This helps to raise the Higgs boson mass if
tan β is small. Also the mixing between the singlet and doublet Higgs ﬁelds pushes the
mass of the SM-like Higgs boson if the singlet is lighter than the doublet. These features
are useful to solve the second problem in the mirage mediation.

We apply the TeV scale mirage mediation to the NMSSM [9, 1]. We consider a model

with the following modular weights for ﬁelds in the NMSSM,

cHu = 0,

cHd = 1,

cS = 0,

ci =

1
2

,

(i = Q, U , D, L, E).

(2.4)

(2.5)

We assume the same modular weights for three generations of quarks and leptons. For
the top Yukawa coupling and λ, the sum rule is satisﬁed, while it is violated for κ and the
bottom Yukawa coupling. Then, we are only interested in the parameter region with small
κ and small/moderate tan β. In any case, we need small κ to evade the Landau pole if we
want to have large λ for raising the Higgs mass. The large tan β region is also excluded
by the LEP chargino mass bound. Thus their corrections to the mirage uniﬁcation are
actually small.
We have chosen the above modular weights because the ﬁne-tuning of the (eﬀective)
µ term is considerably ameliorated [7]. In the context of the natural SUSY [24], |m2
Hu| ∼
µ2 ∼ m2
Z is often quoted as a spectrum to solve the ﬁne-tuning problem in (1.1) and
predicts a light higgsino. However, even if we have |m2
Z with the heavy SUSY
spectrum for some reason, we need another mechanism to ﬁne-tune µ ∼ mZ because
its origin is somehow related with the SUSY breaking and thus belongs to the heavy
spectrum. The doublet Higgs mass matrix of the model at the origin of the potential is
given by,

where i, j = (Hd, Hu). The trace of the mass matrix is given by Tr(M2
0 + µ2 while
M0 cancels in the determinant as Det(M2
H) = µ4. Thus the mass of the light doublet, h
is suppressed as Mh ≈ µ(µ/M0), while that of the heavy doublet, H is MH ≈ M0. This
corresponds to the cancellation of the second and the third terms in the formula,

Thus the electroweak scale mZ is insensitive to µ in the model and mostly determined

that a similar mechanism works in the MSSM, however, the B term is a remnant of the

In the NMSSM, mixing with the singlet may destroy the above nice feature. In addition
it also causes phenomenological problems. If the lightest CP even Higgs boson is doublet
(SM) like, the mixing with the singlet reduces the Higgs boson mass and makes it diﬃcult
to achieve 125 GeV. If the lightest CP even Higgs boson is singlet like, the mixing with
the doublet tightens the constraint from the LEP Higgs boson search because it couples
with the Z boson via the mixing. However, we ﬁnd that, in the model with κ << 1 and
m2
like we are considering, this mixing is suppressed due to approximate scale
symmetries [1]. In the limit, κ = 0 and m2
S = 0, the model has the following approximate
scale symmetry,

Hu(x) = e2φH(cid:48)
Hd(x) = e2φH(cid:48)

(2.8)
(2.9)
(2.10)
which is explicitly broken by the K¨ahler potential S†S, the D-term potential and all
the kinetic terms. The VEVs of Hd,u breaks the symmetry and the light doublet is the
corresponding Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson which is inherently a mass eigen state. Thus
the mass and the mixing with the singlet must pick up the explicit breaking. While in
the κ = 0 and m2
Hu = 0 limit, the model has another approximate symmetry in which S
and Hu are exchanged in the above formulas. The NG boson is a mixture of S and Hd
and its mass and the mixing with Hu also need to pick up the explicit breaking. Thus the
mixing between the light doublet and the singlet must pick up the explicit breaking terms
of the both symmetries or a term breaking both of them because it vanishes if either of
the symmetries survives. In addition, the mixing disappears if Hd decouples and it must
be suppressed by m2
(Thus, only κ or the gauge coupling is not enough to generate
the mixing). Therefore the doublet-singlet mixing is expected to be highly suppressed at
classical level in the model.

In the following we show the results of our numerical calculations. We solve the one-loop
renormalization group equations from the uniﬁcation scale to the SUSY scale, assuming

the boundary condition (2.5) in addition with the contribution from the anomaly media-
tion. We adopt these solutions for the SUSY spectrum and the large parameters, however,
discard them for the small parameters, m2
S, µ and Aκ. We rather deal them as free
parameters at the SUSY scale, taking into account the ambiguities stemming from the
threshold corrections and two-loop renormalization group running. Then we solve the
minimum of the one-loop eﬀective Higgs potential in terms of them so that we obtain the
observed value of mZ. We accept the solutions if they are within the range of the ambigu-
ities. We ﬁx Aκ to a reference value −100 GeV because there are not enough equations to
determine it. We use the NMSSMTools package for calculating the physical mass spectrum
[25]. We have three CP-even, two CP-odd and one charged Higgs bosons. The heaviest
CP-even, CP-odd and charged Higgs bosons correspond to the heavy doublet and have
almost degenerate masses ≈ M0. We have two CP-even and one CP-odd Higgs bosons at
the electroweak scale. We chose the default option of the NMSSMTools to estimate their
mass spectrum.

In the plots, the red curve indicate that,
outside of it, λ or κ hits the Landau-pole below the uniﬁcation scale. The gray region on
the bottom of the plots is excluded because the Higgs boson is tachyonic. In another gray
region around the red curve, an iterative method to solve the Higgs mass fails. We do
not take care of this since the region is already excluded by the LEP Higgs boson search.

Now we conﬁrmed that the observed Higgs boson mass is realized with the TeV scale
mirage mediation in the NMSSM, next we estimate the degree of ﬁne-tuning of the elec-
troweak symmetry breaking in this model. First we deﬁne the ﬁne-tuning measures. We
deﬁne them as following,

must be considered once we extend the Higgs sector. As for the input parameter x, we
take the small parameters. Note that the large parameters like m2
and Aλ are ﬁxed by
the UV physics and not free parameters. The worst measure, ∆ = max(∆y

for tan β = 3, M0 = 1500 GeV and Aκ = −100 GeV. In the
plots, the red points satisfy 124 GeV < mh1 < 126 GeV and also the requirement of the
TeV scale mirage mediation, as we saw in the previous section. On the other hand, the
blue points indicate 124 GeV < mh2 < 126 GeV, although they are already excluded by
the LEP Higgs boson search [30].
In both cases, the ﬁne-tuning measures are better
than 10 unless mh1 is much lighter than the electroweak scale. This low ﬁne-tuning is
not a trivial result because the khaki region which is not necessarily favored by the TeV
scale mirage mediation (but not far from it) reaches 100 even with a moderate value of
mh1. Figure 4 shows the similar plots for ∆µ
x. All of them are below the unity if mh1 is

in our model because µ ≈ M0/ tan β holds very well, which ensures the µ cancellation
mechanism.

GeV.

Figure 5 shows the ﬁne-tuning measures for tan β = 10. The other parameters are
same as in the tan β = 3 case. Here, only the points satisfying 124 GeV < mh2 < 126 GeV
are plotted. For this tan β, no parameter region realizes 124 GeV < mh1 < 126 GeV.
Almost all the points are below 10 unless mh1 is too light. Note that the ﬁne-tuning is
most relaxed around mh1 (cid:39) 100 GeV which is exactly the region surviving from the LEP
Higgs boson search as we will see later [30].

With the above numerical analysis, we conclude that our model realizes the electroweak
symmetry breaking with better than 10% tuning for 1.5 TeV gluino and 1 TeV stop masses.
For completeness, we raise the SUSY scale, M0 up to 5 TeV in ﬁgure 6. It is surprising
that the worst measure ∆m2
is around 40 at M0 = 5 TeV which is acceptable in the
Z
m2
standard of conventional 1 TeV models. It is also noted that ∆µ
is again most relaxed
m2
around mh1 (cid:39) 100 GeV where the constraint from the LEP Higgs boson search is weak

The calculation is performed by the NMSSMTools package. In ﬁgure 7, we plot the square of
the scaling factors for tan β = 3, M0 = 1500 GeV and Aκ = −100 GeV. Here the lightest
CP-even Higgs boson is the SM like. With the vertical lines, we indicate the precision of
their measurement at LHC (300 f b−1) [37], ILC 250 GeV and ILC 500 GeV [38]. The
positions of them are arbitrary. Because of the little hierarchy, the loop corrections from
the SUSY particles are negligible. Thus the deviations come from the mixing between
the light doublet and singlet Higgs bosons. Consequently, a sum rule (κ1)2 + (κ2)2 = 1

holds well except for the bottom quark or the tau lepton, for which the mixing with the
heavy doublet is not negligible due to the tan β enhanced couplings. According to the
ﬁgure, the approximate scale symmetries suppress the deviation in the scaling factors of
the SM-like Higgs boson below 5% for the vector bosons, top quark (left panel) and loop
induced couplings (right panel). ILC can resolve some of them but it is hard for LHC. The
deviations for the bottom quark and tau lepton are below 10% and ILC will be able to
investigate their detail. On the other hand, the couplings of the singlet-like Higgs boson
are below 30% of those for the SM Higgs boson for the vector bosons, top quark and loop
induced couplings. The couplings for the bottom quark and tau lepton can be 50 % of
those for the SM Higgs boson. LHC might be able to detect them. However ILC is most
suitable to ﬁnd the hidden new boson and examine its precise coupling strengths thanks
to its background free nature.

In ﬁgure 8, we plot the square of the scaling factors for tan β = 10. The other
parameters are same as in ﬁgure 7. Now the second lightest CP even boson is the SM
like. In the ﬁgure, the khaki regions are phenomenologically excluded mainly by the LEP
Higgs boson search. Remember that the surviving region has the lowest ﬁne-tuning as
we saw in the previous section. We can see the sum rule holds well again except for the
bottom quark and tau lepton. The deviations of the scale factors for the SM-like Higgs
boson amount to 10% (30%) for the vector bosons, top quark and loop induced couplings
(the bottom quark and the tau lepton). The enhancement of the deviations occurs because
the SM-like Higgs boson requires a sizable mixing with the lighter singlet to achieve 125
GeV, since λ is now not eﬀective to raise the Higgs boson mass. If we increase M0, the
surviving region extends while the deviations shrink since the mixing is replaced with
the top radiative correction to lift the SM-like Higgs boson mass. Simultaneously, the
ﬁne-tuning deteriorates as in ﬁgure 6. In ﬁgure 8, The couplings of the singlet-like Higgs

boson to the bottom quark and the tau lepton can be 80% of those for the SM Higgs
boson due to tan β enhanced contribution of the heavy doublet, while those to the vector
bosons and top quark is 40% of the SM. It is hard to examine this low energy region by
LHC. ILC has more advantage to rediscover the particles escaped from LEP.

6 Conclusion

We proposed that the TeV scale mirage mediation in NMSSM is a novel solution for the
little hierarchy problem in SUSY. The hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the
SUSY scale is realized by the mirage uniﬁcation. The SM-like Higgs boson reaches 125
GeV by the new quartic coupling or the mixing with the singlet. We calculated the ﬁne-
tuning measures of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the model. The ﬁne-tuning is
better than 10% with 1.5 TeV gluino and 1 TeV stop, while the eﬀective µ can be as
heavy as 500 GeV thanks to a cancellation mechanism. An undesirable singlet-doublet
mixing is suppressed due to the approximate scale symmetries. We found 5-10% deviation
in the SM-like Higgs couplings. O(1) deviation is possible for the bottom quark and the
tau lepton due to tan β enhanced couplings of the heavy doublet and its mixing in the
SM-like Higgs boson. The singlet-like Higgs boson is around the electroweak scale and
its couplings are suppressed due to the scale symmetries. It is an interesting target for
future lepton colliders.
