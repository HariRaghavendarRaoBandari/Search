Searching for Ξ+

cc in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions

We study the doubly charmed baryon Ξ+

cc in high energy nuclear collisions. We solve the three-
body Schr¨odinger equation with relativistic correction and calculate the Ξ+
cc yield and transverse
momentum distribution via coalescence mechanism. For Ξ+
cc production in central Pb + Pb collisions
at LHC energy, the yield is extremely enhanced, and the production cross section per binary collision
is one order of magnitude larger than that in p+p collisions. This indicates that, it is most probable
to discover Ξ+
cc in heavy ion collisions and its discovery can be considered as a probe of the quark-
gluon plasma formation.

The ﬂavor SU(4) quark model predicts 22 charmed
baryons [1]. Searching for them experimentally has
been an active direction in the ﬁeld of high energy
physics, but most of them are not yet discovered. The
main reason for hardly observing charmed baryons, es-
pecially multicharmed baryons, in elementary collisions
like p+p and e+ + e− is the rare production of charm
quarks in these collisions. For instance, for the pro-
duction of triply charmed baryon Ωccc, it requires at
least three pairs of charm quarks with small relative
momenta in an event. This is very diﬃcult even at
LHC energy.
In high energy nuclear collisions, how-
ever, there are plenty of oﬀ-diagonal charm quarks in
the created ﬁreball. For instance, the c¯c pair number
can reach 10 in Au + Au collisions at RHIC energy
and 100 in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy [2]. These
uncorrelated charm quarks can be combined to form
charmed hadrons via statistics. Obviously, the combi-
nation will largely enhance the yield of multicharmed
baryons.

The production of charmed hadrons in high energy
nuclear collisions is closely related to the Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP) formation in the early stage of the col-
lisions. Due to the rapid expansion of the colliding
system, the temperature of the formed ﬁreball drops
down fast, and one cannot directly see the QGP in the
ﬁnal state of the collisions. In 1986, Matsui and Satz
pointed out the J/ψ suppression as a signature of the
QGP formation [3]. Considering the combination of c
and ¯c, the J/ψ regeneration [4] in QGP and its compe-
tition [5–7] with the initial production explain well the
experimental data of charmonium yield and transverse
momentum distributions at RHIC and LHC energies.
Extending to the production of multicharmed baryons,
the largely enhanced production cross section via the
combination of charm quarks in QGP makes them as a
unique probe of the new state of matter [8].

In this Letter we investigate the production of doubly
charmed baryon Ξ+
cc in high energy nuclear collisions.
The experimental search for Ξ+
cc lasts for decades. The
SELEX collaboration [9] claimed the observation of Ξ+
cc
in 2003, but the FOCUS [10], Belle [11], BaBar [12]
and LHCb [13] collaborations failed to reproduce the
results.
In comparison with triply charmed Ωccc [8],
the production probability of doubly charmed baryons
should be much larger, and the decay modes of Ξ+
cc
are already widely discussed theoretically and exper-
imentally [9–14]. We will ﬁrst solve the three-body

Schr¨odinger equation, including relativistic correction,
to obtain the wave function and Wigner function of the
ground bound state of three quarks ccq, and then cal-
culate the Ξ+
cc yield and transverse momentum distri-
bution in heavy ion collisions through the coalescence
mechanism on the hypersurface of deconﬁnement phase
transition determined by hydrodynamics.

We employ the Schr¨odinger equation to describe the

bound state of three quarks ccq,

ˆHΨ(r1, r2, r3) = ET Ψ(r1, r2, r3),

ˆH =

+ V (r1, r2, r3)

(1)

with the total energy ET and wave function Ψ. To
be speciﬁc, we choose the index i = 1, 2 for the two
charm quarks and i = 3 for the light quark. As a
usually used approximation [15], we neglect the three-
body interaction and express the potential as a sum

of pair interactions, V = Pi<j v(ri, rj). According to

the leading order QCD, the diquark potential is only
one half of the quark-antiquark potential.
If one as-
sumes such a relation in the case of strong coupling
and take the Cornell potential, there is v(ri, rj) =
(−α/|ri − rj| + σ|ri − rj|) /2, where α = π/12 and
σ = 0.2 GeV2 are coupling parameters of the poten-
tial which together with the quark masses mc = 1.25
GeV and mq = 0.3 GeV reproduce well the D, J/ψ and
ψ′ masses in vacuum. In hot and dense medium, the
interaction among quarks should be weakened. From
the lattice calculation [16], however, the J/ψ spectral
function is clearly broadened only when the tempera-
ture is much higher than the critical temperature Tc.
Therefore, we can still take the Cornell potential at the
coalescence which happens at Tc.

We take the hyperspherical method [15] to solve
the three-body Schr¨odinger equation.
Introducing
the global coordinate R and relative coordinates rx
and ry through the transformation R = (mcr1 +

mcr2 + mqr3)/M , rx = pmc/(2µ)(r1 − r2) and ry =
p2mcmq/(µM ) (r3 − (r1 + r2)/2) with the total mass

M = 2mc + mq and an arbitrary parameter µ with
mass dimension which disappears in the end and its
value does not aﬀect the result. With the new coordi-
nates, the motion of the three-quark bound state can
be factorized into the global motion and relative mo-
tion, Ψ(R, rx, ry) = Θ(R)Φ(rx, ry). By rewriting the
amplitudes of rx and ry in terms of the hyperradius

r = qr2

x + r2

y and hyperpolar angle α = arctan(rx/ry)
and constructing the 6-dimension relative motion space
(r, Ω) = (r, α, θx, ϕx, θy, ϕy) where θx, ϕx and θy, ϕy are
azimuthal angles of rx and ry, the kinetic energy in the
center of mass frame can be separated into a radial part
and an angular part with corresponding eigen states
R(r) and Yκ(Ω) [17], where κ stands for the 5 quan-
tum numbers (k, l, m, lx, ly) in the triplet-singlet repre-
sentation. However, the potential V (r, Ω) depends on
both the hyperradius r and the 5 angles, the relative
motion cannot be factorized into a radial part and an
angular part. Considering that the eigen states Yκ(Ω)
constitute a complete set, we express the relative wave
function as a linear combination of them,

Φ(r, Ω) = Xκ

φκ(r)Yκ(Ω).

(2)

Substituting the
expansion into the Schr¨odinger
equation and taking the orthonormal relations for
Yκ(Ω) [17], we obtain the coupled ordinary diﬀerential
equations for the hyperradial wave functions φκ(r),

with dΩ = sin2 α cos2 α sin θx sin θydαdθxdθydϕxdϕy
and binding energy ǫ. For the ground bound state
Ξ+
cc, we take only the ﬁrst two hyperspherical harmonic
functions Y0 = 1/π3/2 and Y1 = 2 cos(2α)/π3/2,

Φ(r, Ω) = φ0(r)Y0(Ω) + φ1(r)Y1(Ω).

This leads to two coupled equations for the ﬁrst two

The two ordinary diﬀerential equations can be numeri-
cally solved by using the Inverse Power Method [18],
and the radial components φ0(r) and φ1(r) for the
ground state Ξ+
cc are shown in Fig.1. The second com-
ponent φ1 is much smaller than the ﬁrst component
φ0 at any r, indicating that the truncation (5) is good
enough for Ξ+
cc.

the Ξ+
If Ξ+

cc mass is in between 3.5 GeV and 3.7 GeV.
cc is considered as the ground bound state of the
quark(q)-diquark(cc) system, its motion is described in
two steps, the diquark motion and the quark-diquark
motion. Both are controlled by a two-body Schr¨odinger
equation. We recalculated the Ξ+
cc wave function in
this case, it is similar to the one obtained with the
hyperspherical method, and the Ξ+
cc mass and average
radius are respectively 3.62 GeV and 0.41 fm. The
similarity between the two methods is due to the large
mass diﬀerence between the light and heavy quarks.

Using the relativistically corrected wave function, we

where p is the 6-dimension momentum corresponding
to the relative coordinate r. Taking the ﬁrst axis of the
integrated vector y in the direction of p and the second
axis on the plane constructed by p and r, the Wigner

function is largely simpliﬁed and depends only on r, p, α
and the angle θ between r and p. By integrating out
the angles, we obtain the probability to ﬁnd the three
quarks in the ground bound state Ξ+

tance r and relative momentum p,

probable position at (hri,hpi) =(0.41 fm, 1.4 GeV) and
the standard deviation (σ2

cc production via coalescence
mechanism in high energy nuclear collisions. The co-
alescence mechanism [27] has been successfully used
to describe the light hadron production, especially the
quark number scaling of the elliptic ﬂow [28] and the
enhancement of the baryon to meson ratio [29, 30]. In
coalescence models, the change in the constituent dis-
tribution before and after the coalescence process is re-
quired to be small, namely the number of constituents
involved in the coalescence must be small compared
with the total particle number of the system. In this
sense, the coalescence mechanism is more suitable for
the production of rare particles like Ξ+
cc. The coales-
cence probability, namely the Wigner function, is usu-
ally parameterized as a Gaussian distribution [27, 31]
and the width is ﬁxed by ﬁtting the data. For multi-
charmed baryons, however, there are currently no data,
and an adjustable coalescence probability will lose the
prediction power of the calculation. For Ξ+
cc we use the
above calculated Wigner function W as the coalescence
probability.

The QGP created in the early stage of a heavy ion
collision is very close to an ideal ﬂuid and its space-
time evolution is controlled by hydrodynamic equations
∂µT µν = 0 with T µν being the energy-momentum ten-
sor. The initial condition at time τ0 = 0.6 fm/c is de-
termined by the colliding energy and nuclear geometry,
which leads to a maximum initial temperature T0 = 484
MeV in central Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N = 2.76
TeV [32]. To close the evolution equations, we take the
equation of state of the hot medium with a ﬁrst order
phase transition between the ideal QGP and hadron gas
at critical temperature Tc = 165 MeV. By solving the
hydrodynamic equations, one obtains the local temper-
ature T (x) and ﬂuid velocity uµ(x) which will be used
in the coalescence.

The coalescence happens on the hadronization hyper-
surface σµ(R), and the 4D coordinates Rµ = (t, R) on
the hypersurface is constrained by the critical temper-
ature T (Rµ) = Tc which leads to the coalescence time
t = t(Tc, R). The observed momentum distribution of
Ξ+
cc via coalescence mechanism can be calculated from
the Wigner function [27],

in the laboratory frame, the coordinates
vµ = Pµ/mΞ+
˜ri and momenta ˜pi in the quark distribution function
F and ri and pi in the Wigner function W are related

The three quark distribution F can be factorized as
F (˜r1, ˜r2, ˜r3, ˜p1, ˜p2, ˜p3) = Sfc(˜r1, ˜p1)fc(˜r2, ˜p2)fq(˜r3, ˜p3),
where the constant S = 1/2 counts the symmetry of
the two charm quarks. The light quark motion in QGP
is controlled by the Fermi distribution fq(˜r3, ˜p3) =
Nqf (˜r3, ˜p3) = Nq/(euµ ˜pµ
3 /T + 1) with the degeneracy
factor Nq = 6 and local velocity uµ(˜r3) and temper-
ature T (˜r3) of the ﬂuid. The charm quarks are pro-
duced through initial hard processes (their regeneration
in the QGP at √sN N = 2.76 TeV is very small and can
safely be neglected [33]) and then interact with the hot
medium. The single charm quark distribution fc is in
principle between the pQCD distribution with weak in-
teraction and equilibrium distribution with strong in-
teraction. From the experimental data at LHC [34],
the observed large quench factor and elliptic ﬂow for
charmed mesons indicate that charm quarks are almost
thermalized with the medium. Therefore, one can take,
as a good approximation, a kinetically equilibrated
distribution fc(˜ri, ˜pi) = ρc(˜ri)Nc(˜ri)f (˜ri, ˜pi), where
Nc(˜ri) is the normalization factor of the Fermi distri-
bution. Diﬀerent from light quarks, charm quarks are
not chemically equilibrated in QGP [35], and the space-
time evolution of the number density ρc is governed by
the conservation law during the expansion [33],

∂µ (ρc(˜ri)uµ) = 0

(12)

with the initial number density ρc(τ0, ˜ri) determined
by the colliding nuclear geometry and the cross section
σc¯c
pp of charm quark pair production in p+p collisions.
We can now calculate the Ξ+
cc yield and transverse
momentum distribution through the coalescence ap-
proach (11) in heavy ion collisions. The yield as a func-
tion of the number of binary collisions Ncoll at middle

rapidity |y| < 1 in Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N = 2.76
TeV is shown in Fig.3. In the calculation we have taken
the charm quark cross section dσc¯c
pp/dy = 0.7 mb [36].
If we consider a homogeneous ﬁreball with volume V
and a momentum independent coalescence probability,
the Ξ+
cc ∼ (Nc/V )2V =
N 2
c /V ∼ Ncoll, where we have assumed that both the
charm quark number Nc and the ﬁreball volume V are
proportional to Ncoll. This explains the approximate
linear increase in Fig.3.

to the statistical law, the Ξ+
ccs produced via coalescence
mechanism are mainly distributed at low momentum
with averaged momentum hPTi ≃ 2 GeV which should
be much smaller than that through hard processes in
p+p collisions. As a consequence of the coalescence
mechanism, the feature of the increasing baryon to me-
son ratio at intermediate and high transverse momen-
tum in heavy ion collisions [29, 30] remains for the Ξ+

In heavy ion collisions, transverse motion is devel-

is sensitive to the hot medium properties. In order to
understand the Ξ+

the properties of the medium, we calculated the Ξ+
cc

We brieﬂy discuss the decay modes of Ξ+

cc which are
closely related to its experimental discovery. Since Ξ+
cc
is the ground state of the baryons with three quarks
ccq, its decay is via weak interaction. Possible decay
modes include [9–14] Ξ+

cc → D0pK −π+, Ξ+
Ξ+
c π+π−
and Ξ+
cπ+. The lifetime calculated via optical
theorem is in between 110 and 250 fs [38, 39]. The
short lifetime is probably a challenge to the experimen-
tal measurement of Ξ+
cc.

In summary, we studied the doubly charmed baryon
Ξ+
cc in high energy nuclear collisions. We solved the
Schr¨odinger equation for the bound state of three
quarks ccq with relativistic correction, and calculated
the corresponding Wigner function which is the coales-
cence probability for the three quarks to combine into
a Ξ+
cc in phase space. For Pb+Pb collisions at LHC
energy, we computed the Ξ+
cc yield and transverse mo-
mentum distribution through coalescence. We found
that, the Ξ+
cc production is extremely enhanced, and
the eﬀective production cross section per binary colli-
sion is already one order of magnitude larger than that
in p+p collisions. This indicates that, it is most prob-
able to ﬁnd Ξ+
cc in heavy ion collisions at LHC energy,
and its discovery can be taken as a signal of the QGP
formation.
