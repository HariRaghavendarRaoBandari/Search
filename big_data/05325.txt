Spin waves are collective excitations propagating in the magnetic medium with ordered magnetizations.
Magnonics, utilizing the spin wave (magnon) as information carrier, is a promising candidate for low-dissipation
computation and communication technologies. We discover that, due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,
the scattering behavior of spin wave at a magnetic domain wall follows a generalized Snell’s law, where two
magnetic domains work as two different mediums. Similar to optical total reﬂection that occurs at the water-air
interfaces, spin waves may experience total reﬂection at magnetic domain walls when their incident angle larger
than a critical value. We design a spin wave ﬁber using a magnetic domain structure with two domain walls,
and demonstrate that such a spin wave ﬁber can transmit spin waves over long distance by total internal reﬂec-
tions, in analogy to an optical ﬁber. Our design of spin wave ﬁber opens up new possibilities in pure magnetic
information processing.

A trend in post-silicon information processing is the devel-
opment of systems that employ (quasi-) particles other than
electrons as the information carriers to avoid the the Joule
heating. One of the most promising candidates is magnonics
[1, 2], which transfers information through the collective exci-
tations of magnetization, or called spin waves (magnons).The
crucial advantage of using spin waves as information carriers
lies in that they can propagate in both conducting and insulat-
ing magnetic materials without physical motion of electrons.
This enables the development of insulator-based information
systems that produce no Joule heating at all. In addition, spin
waves can be manipulated via magnetic structures in a single
material instead of heterogenous structures of several different
materials. This makes it possible to realize a rewritable spin
wave logic architecture [3]. Due to these desirable features,
magnonics becomes a new realm of active interdisciplinary
research and we have witnessed rapid and fruitful develop-
ments in recent years. [3–8]. A key issue for the development
of magnonic devices is the design of “wires” that guide the
propagation of spin waves (magnons).

The World Wide Web (Internet), one of the most important
infrastructures of the modern society, would not be possible
without the optical ﬁber, which transmits information across
long distance with little loss. Here we report a design of the
spin wave ﬁber that carries spin waves with little loss, in an
analog of the optical ﬁber but transmits spin waves rather than
photons. The design is based on a magnetic domain struc-
ture with two domain walls, at which spin waves are totally
reﬂected due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
[9, 10], an asymmetric magnetic interaction induced by the
spin-orbit interaction. An optical ﬁber is a cylindrical struc-
ture consisting of a core and a cladding layer, which are made
of different dielectric materials. The different refraction in-
dices of these two materials cause the total reﬂection at the
boundary of the core and cladding layers [11]. In contrast, it
is feasible and convenient to use one single material but dif-
ferent magnetic domains for the core and cladding layer in
a spin wave ﬁber. Typically, the spin wave dispersion rela-
tion does not vary much across magnetic domains. However,

the DMI leads to a domain-dependent spin wave dispersion,
which gives rise to a total reﬂection of spin waves at the do-
main walls as needed for the design of spin wave ﬁbers.

Model. To illustrate the scattering behavior of spin waves
at magnetic domain walls, we consider a magnetic thin ﬁlm
with two magnetic domains with opposite magnetization di-
rections, and a Bloch domain wall in between as shown in Fig.
1. The ﬁlm is in the x-y plane and has an in-plane easy-axis
along ˆy. The magnetization in the left/right domain is along
∓ˆy direction, respectively. The domain wall is also along the
ˆy direction.
In continuum approximation, the magnetic dynamics is de-

scribed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation,

where m(r, t) is the unit vector representing the magnetiza-
tion direction, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, αG is the Gilbert
damping parameter, and γHeﬀ = Kmy ˆy+A∇2m−D∇×m
is the effective magnetic ﬁeld with K the magnetic uniax-
ial anisotropy (along the ˆy direction), A the exchange cou-
pling constant, and D the parameter for the DMI. Different
from the exchange coupling which favors parallel alignment
of magnetizations, the DMI tends to promote helical mag-
netic structures [12]. However, if the DMI is not too strong
(D < 2√AK), the exchange coupling still dominates and the
magnetization in each domain stays parallel to ˆy. Let m0 be
the static magnetization direction, and δm = mθˆeθ + mφˆeφ
be the dynamical excitation on top of the static m0, with
ˆeθ,φ ⊥ m0 as the two transverse directions to m0.
In the
small excitation approximation (mθ,φ (cid:28) 1), the dispersion
relation of the spin wave excitation in the left/right domain
with m0 = ∓ˆy is given by [13, 14]

ω(k) = K + A(k2

where k = (kx, ky) is the wavevector for the spin wave mode.
In the absence of DMI (D = 0), the spin wave modes with fre-
quency ω form a circle centered at the origin in the wavevec-
tor k-space. However, the DMI, in the last term in Eq. (2),

wavelength engineering. The generalized magnonic Snell’s
law can lead to the anomalous negative refraction of spin wave
[22–24]. Note that in Fig. 1 the static magnetization in the
left/right domain m0 = ∓ˆy is parallel to the domain wall,
In a general situation where m0 in
which is also along ˆy.
the left/right domain forms an angle ±ξ with the domain wall
(along ˆy), the offset of the isofrequency circle along ˆy is re-
duced to ∆ cos ξ, thus the magnonic Snell’s law in Eq. (3) is
modiﬁed with a substitution ∆ → ∆ cos ξ.
(3), total
reﬂection occurs when the incident angle α satisﬁes θc < α <
π/2 (the thick magenta segment in Fig. 1) with the critical

According to the magnonic Snell’s law in Eq.

.

As a result, the modes with incident angle −π/2 < α < θc
(the thick green segment in Fig. 1) are refracted into the right
domain. Depending on value of ∆/kg(ω) (thus on D and ω),
the critical angle θc can take any value between −π/2 and
π/2. For instance, when there is no DMI (D = 0), θc = π/2
and all incident modes will be transmitted and no total reﬂec-
tion occurs. While when D is strong (or ω is small) such that
the offset between the two isofrequency circles 2∆ > kg(ω),
θc = −π/2 and all incident modes will be totally reﬂected.
Semiclassical picture. An interesting question to ask is
what exactly happens as the spin wave transmits through the
domain wall, that has a ﬁnite width w, over which the magne-
tization vector m0(r) continuously varies from one direction
to the other. The magnetic texture of a domain wall can be
described by m0(x) = (sin θ0 cos φ0, sin θ0 sin φ0, cos θ0),
where θ0(x), φ0(x) are the polar and azimuthal angle of m0
with respect to ˆz. For a Bloch type domain wall, in the pres-
ence of DMI, a Walker conﬁguration with φ0(x) = π/2,
θ0(x) = −π/2 − 2sign(D) arctan[exp(x/w)] is still stable,
In this conﬁguration, the magnetization continuously rotates
from −ˆy to +ˆy in the y-z plane, and the rotation direction is
controlled by the sign of DMI constant D.
By rewriting the dynamical excitation δm as ψ = mθ −
imφ, the LLG equation Eq. (1) for δm can be recast to a
Schrödinger-like equation for ψ [3, 25, 26]:

potential, and A(x) = −(Dm∗e/c) tanh(x/w)ˆy is the DMI-

special because it is reﬂectionless when there is no DMI. [25]
The vector potential gives rise to an effective magnetic ﬁeld
B(x) = ∇ × A = −(Dm∗e/cw)sech2(x/w)ˆz, which is
perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane and maximizes at the cen-
ter of the domain wall. As x/w → ±∞, the vector poten-
tial A(x) → ±D/2A, which corresponds to the shift of ky

structure with magnetization pointing in m0 = ∓ˆy in the left/right
domain and m0 continuously rotates from −ˆy to +ˆy over a charac-
teristic domain wall width w as depicted in the upper right inset. The
isofrequency circles in the wavevector space are shifted for two mag-
netic domains with opposite magnetizations when DMI is present.
The spin wave modes on both circles have the same frequency ω.
The modes on the thick green segment can be refracted into the other
domain because there exist propagating modes with the same ky on
the isofrequency circle across the domain wall. However, the modes
on the thick magenta segment cannot pass and must be totally re-
ﬂected due to the lack of the propagating modes with the same ky
across the domain wall.

(cid:12)(cid:12) = kg(ω) = (cid:112)(ω − K)/A + ∆2 is the distance from

Snell’s law for spin wave. An important consequence of
the opposite shifts of the isofrequency circles in the left and
right domains is spin wave refraction across the domain wall,
when the spin wave strikes from left domain with an incident
angle α (angle of the group velocity with respect to the do-
main wall normal +ˆx direction), it is refracted to a mode with
an outgoing angle β in the right domain. To guarantee con-
tinuity of the wavevector (ky) along the domain wall, the re-
fraction angle obeys the generalized Snell’s law [15, 16],

kg sin α + ∆ = kg sin β − ∆.

This is an analogy of the generalized Snell’s law in photon-
ics [15–19] and phononics [20, 21] across meta-surfaces, in
which a phase gradient is introduced at the interface between
two mediums by sub-wavelength engineering.
In compari-
son to the complicated meta-surfaces in its optical and acous-
tic counterparts, it is much easier and more straightforward
to realize the non-trivial Snell’s law in magnonics, i.e., sim-
ply by introducing DMI in the whole ﬁlm without any sub-

mentioned above in the left/right domain as in Eq. (2). With
Eq. (5), the scattering behavior for spin waves by a domain
wall is exactly the same as that for an electron by a scalar po-
tential V and a vector potential A (and the associated ﬁeld
B).

As mentioned above the scalar potential V is a reﬂection-
less one, thus the spin wave scattering behavior is mostly
dominated by the vector potential (and the effective magnetic
ﬁeld). The effective magnetic ﬁeld B(x)(cid:107)ˆz is perpendicular to
the ﬁlm, and only exists in the domain wall region, as denoted
by the symbol (cid:12) in Fig. 2(a). The spin wave scattering be-
haviors shown in Fig. 2 can all be understood by considering
the effective Lorentz force exerted by this effective magnetic
ﬁeld on an electron in the domain wall region. Evidently, spin
waves striking into such an effective magnetic ﬁeld region will
be bent counter-clockwise due to the effective Lorentz force.
Consequently, the spin wave that passes through the magnetic
ﬁeld region (the domain wall region), is refracted in counter-
clockwise direction. Moreover, if the incident angle is too
shallow (α > θc), the Lorentz force is able to bend the tra-
jectory so much such that the spin wave is completely turned
back, and a total reﬂection occurs.

Total reﬂection for micromagnetic simulations. The refrac-
tion and reﬂection behaviors for spin waves at a domain wall
discussed above are conﬁrmed by micromagnetic simulations.
According to Eq. (3), the incident and the refracted angles sat-
isfy −π/2 ≤ α < β ≤ π/2 (for D > 0), thus the spin wave
trajectory should always bend counter-clockwise. Fig. 2(a)
shows the schematic diagram of the spin wave trajectories for
various incident angles: when α > θc, the spin wave is to-
tally reﬂected (magenta trajectory); when α < θc, the spin
wave is refracted (green trajectories); the black trajectory cor-
responds to the critical situation with α = θc. Fig. 2(b-f)
show the micromagnetic simulation for the ﬁve different inci-
dent angles: α = 60◦, 52.4◦, 30◦,−6◦,−60◦, corresponding

to the total reﬂection (b), critical incidence (c), and refraction
(d,e,f). Because of the reﬂectionlessness of the scalar poten-
tial V (x) for a Bloch domain wall, the spin wave refractions
as in Fig. 2(d-f) is not accompanied by any reﬂection, which
is quite different from its optical analog. More interestingly,
Fig. 2(e) shows the anomalous negative refraction, i.e., both
incident and refracted trajectories lie in the same side of nor-
mal direction of the scattering plane (the domain wall). All
spin wave beams in Fig. 2(b-f) are bent counter clockwise, as
predicted by the magnonic Snell’s law Eq. (3). Such bending
trajectories can be alternatively understood by semiclassical
picture above using the effective Lorentz force acting on the
spin wave by the DMI induced effective magnetic ﬁeld (indi-
cated by symbol (cid:12) in Fig. 2(a)) localized at the domain wall
region [3].
Spin wave ﬁber. Making use of the total reﬂection at the
interface (domain wall) between two magnetic domains with
opposite magnetization directions, a spin wave ﬁber design is
proposed as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The ﬁber is consisted of
one magnetic domain sandwiched by two magnetic domains
with the opposite magnetization direction. Because the ef-
fective magnetic ﬁelds (directions indicated by the ⊗ and (cid:12)
symbols in Fig. 3(a)) in the upper and lower domain wall are
opposite to each other , the spin wave experiences opposite
effective Lorentz forces at the upper and lower domain walls.
Consequently, spin waves can be transported in the core cen-
tral domain from left to right by total reﬂections at both do-
main walls as indicated by the (magenta) right-going trajec-
tory.
In contrast, the spin wave propagating from right to
left will be refracted (leaked) into the cladding layers. There-
fore, the spin wave ﬁber is unidirectional. However, if the
spin wave frequency is small enough such that 2∆ > kg(ω),
the critical angle reaches θc = −π/2, then total reﬂections
occurs for all spin wave modes in all directions, and the spin
wave ﬁber is bidirectional. A simple estimate of the spin wave

the each domain colored by yellow/orange (white/gray) for schematic diagram (simulation). (a) The schematic of the spin wave ﬁber. The
magnetization direction in the central core domain is opposite to that in the upper/lower cladding domain. The solid/dashed trajectory is
expected for right/left moving spin waves excited at the green bar. The effective magnetic ﬁelds in the upper/lower domain walls point in
the opposite directions. Consequently, the right moving spin waves are conﬁned in the central core domain, while the left moving modes
are refracted into the cladding domains. (b) The simulated propagation of the spin wave beams excited at green bar with exciting frequency

circle of the central (upper/lower) domain, from Eq. (2).

coherence length [4, 8] is lφ ∼ 1/αGk > 100 µm, much
larger than the typical length of our spin wave ﬁber structure

(w =(cid:112)A/K ≈ 30nm), ensuring that the functionality of the

spin wave ﬁber is safe from the damping effect.

The transporting feature of the spin wave ﬁber is conﬁrmed
by magnetic simulations. Fig. 3(b) shows the propagation of a
spin wave beam excited at the central core domain with an in-
cident angle α > θc. As expected, the right-going spin wave
is totally reﬂected back to the central core domain without
leaking to the cladding domains. In contrast, the left-going
spin wave passes the domain wall directly and is completely
leaked into the upper cladding domain as expected. Fig. 3(c)
shows the spin wave pattern in a spin wave ﬁber from the point
source located at the core domain. The interference pattern of
the spin wave on the right side indicates intense reﬂection of
spin wave by the domain walls when propagating rightward,
while the simple pattern on the left side indicates the absence
of reﬂection when propagating leftward. By Fourier trans-
forming the spin wave pattern in the highlighted magenta box
into k-space, we see that the spin wave modes in the far right
falls onto the magenta arc of the isofrequency circle, which
corresponds to the total reﬂection arc in Fig. 1. In contrast,
the Fourier transformation of the spin wave in the green box
in the far left shows only the direct left moving modes, and all
other modes are leaked into the cladding layers by refractions.
The exact agreement with the analytical model identiﬁes the
critical role of the total reﬂection in the unidirectionality of
the spin wave ﬁber.

Conclusion.

In conclusion,

in the presence of

the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we discovered the gener-
alized Snell’s law that governs the spin wave scattering be-
havior at a magnetic domain wall. Similar to the optical case,
a spin wave experiences a total reﬂection when the incident

angle is larger than a critical angle. Using this property, we
designed a spin wave ﬁber that can transport spin waves over
long distance, which is conﬁrmed by micromagnetic simula-
tions. The proposed spin wave ﬁber may be used to intercon-
nect different magnonic computation units.

Methods. The simulations are performed in COMSOL
Multiphysics using the mathematical module where the LLG
equation is transformed into weak form and solved by the
generalized-alpha method (ampliﬁcation of high frequency is
0.6). The sample is a YIG thin ﬁlm with the following param-
eters: the easy-axis anisotropy K/γ = 3.88 × 104 A/m, the
exchange constant A/γ = 3.28 × 10−11 A · m, the gyromag-
netic ratio γ = 2.21× 105 rad· Hz/(A/m)[25], and the DMI
constant D/γ = 2 × 10−3 A. The dipolar interaction is ne-
glected for this operating frequency of exchange spin waves.
The Gaussian spin wave beam is prepared by introducing a
narrow rectangle excitation area, where an oscillating mag-
netic ﬁeld is provided, with its amplitude changing in Gaus-
sian form in the longitudinal direction and keeping constant in
the transverse direction. [27].
