Even though it has been known for decades that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is linked to
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the mechanism how it arises for speciﬁc systems is still subject of
debate. We focused on ﬁnding markers of SOC in the density of states (DOS) and on employing
them for understanding the source of magnetocrystalline anisotropy for the case of adatoms and
monolayers. Fully relativistic ab-initio KKR-Green function calculations were performed for Fe,
Co, and Ni adatoms and monolayers on Au(111) to investigate changes in the orbital-resolved DOS
due to a rotation of magnetization.
In this way one can see that a signiﬁcant contribution to
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy for adatoms comes from pushing of the SOC-split states above
or below the Fermi level. As a result of this, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy crucially
depends on the position of the energy bands of the adatom with respect to the Fermi level of the
substrate. This view is supported by model crystal ﬁeld Hamiltonian calculations.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic anisotropy, i.e., the preference of a system for
being magnetized in a certain direction, is one of the key
properties underlying practical use of magnetic materi-
als. One contribution to the magnetic anisotropy comes
from the classical interaction of magnetic dipoles. This
mechanism stands behind the so-called shape anisotropy
and can be described using classical physics — although
a quantum-mechanical description has been developed as
well.1,2 Another contribution, which becomes important
in particular for small systems such as atomic clusters
or nanostructures, comes from the spin-orbit coupling
(SOC). This magnetocrystalline anisotropy can only be
described within a relativistic quantum-mechanical for-
malism. We will deal exclusively with this SOC-induced
contribution in this work.

A quantitative measure of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy
(MAE), i.e., the diﬀerence between total energies of the
system for two orientations of the magnetization M .
Evaluating the MAE is often numerically very diﬃcult
because one has to subtract two large numbers to get a
small diﬀerence between them. To get accurate results,
one has to tune several technical parameters such as inte-
gration mesh setup in k-space3,4 or the adequacy of the
basis set. For supported nanostructures, the treatment of
the substrate is also very important.5,6 A lot of attention
was devoted to these issues recently.

Nevertheless, there is also another line of research on
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, namely, the eﬀort to
understand its mechanism intuitively and, in particular,
to see which electronic structure features participate in
the phenomenon. One possibility is to use perturbation
theory and to describe spin-orbit interaction approxi-
mately within the two-component formalism by the SOC
term HSOC = ξL · S, where L and S are the orbital

and spin angular momentum operators and ξ is the SOC
strength. For systems studied here the lowest-order non-
vanishing contribution to the total energy is the second-
order term,

∆E(2) = − Xi∈occ

j∈unocc

|hψi| HSOC |ψj i|2

.

(1)

Relying on second order perturbation theory has led to
concepts such as scaling of the MAE with the square of
the SOC strength or the frequently used Bruno and van
der Laan formulae relating the MAE to the anisotropy of
the orbital magnetic moment.7–11 On the other hand, as
the sum in Eq. (1) involves a large number of summands
which may be of comparable magnitude, it may be very
diﬃcult to identify just a few terms as the dominant ones
and in this way to link MAE of a particular system to
speciﬁc features in the electronic structure. Getting a
simple intuitive understanding of the MAE by looking
on the interaction between individual states thus may
be very hard to achieve — despite the eﬀort and inter-
esting results obtained.12–14 Approaches that focus on
integral quantities such as a corresponding susceptibil-
ity (still within second order perturbation theory) could
have a more general use.11

However, other mechanisms of generating the magne-
tocrystalline anisotropy, not accounted for by second or-
der perturbation theory, are also possible and were dis-
cussed in the past.
In particular, Eq. (1) cannot be
used if degenerate levels are coupled. For that situation
another mechanism contributing to the MAE was sug-
gested, namely, a SOC-induced splitting of states that
would be degenerate otherwise.3,11,15–17 If some of these
states are pushed above or below the Fermi level EF ,
a large change of the total energy occurs. For layered
and bulk systems this eﬀect may not be dominant be-
cause relevant states occupy only a restricted region in

k-space.13,17,18 However, the situation could be diﬀerent
for adatoms and clusters, where there is no dispersion in
k-space.

The question then remains whether there exist in
reality systems where the origin of magnetocrystalline
anisotropy can be traced to a SOC-induced splitting of
otherwise degenerate states at EF and where this mech-
anism can be eﬀectively visualized in terms of integral
quantities such as the density of states (DOS). Such a
mechanism could give rise to a large MAE. In fact lately
there have been intensive eﬀorts to understand how the
MAE could be made as large as possible.19–23 A better
intuitive insight into the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
beyond the perturbation theory might be useful in this
context. From a more general point of view, it is desir-
able to have a framework that would enable to visualize
the emergence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy by
means of simple concepts.

We decided therefore to perform a detailed ab ini-
i.e., material-speciﬁc study of magnetocrystalline
tio,
anisotropy for Fe, Co, and Ni adatoms and monolayers
on Au(111). The motivation for this choice is that only
little hybridization between 3d states and Au states is
expected.24 For adatoms, the 3d states could thus have
an atomic-like character where the eﬀect of SOC-induced
splitting of states should be larger than for delocalized
states. Comparison between adatoms and monolayers
could further elucidate the role of diﬀerent factors. We
employ a fully relativistic framework (solving the four
component Dirac equation) to treat the SOC as accu-
rately as possible. The application of Green function
formalism allows a proper treatment of adatoms, avoid-
ing possible artefacts that might arise from a supercell
approach.

Our paper is organized as follows. First we introduce
our computational method and the investigated systems.
Then we present numerical values of MAE and magnetic
moments. The main emphasis is put on showing how the
SOC aﬀects the DOS resolved into components accord-
ing to the magnetic quantum numbers. We demonstrate
that the eﬀect of SOC is much larger if the magnetization
is perpendicular to the plane than if it is in-plane. This
eﬀect is reproduced using a simple crystal-ﬁeld Hamil-
tonian. Some technical details related to projecting the
DOS onto magnetic quantum number components for a
magnetic system are described in the appendix.

II. METHODS

A. Computational scheme

The electronic structure is calculated within the ab
initio spin density functional
framework, relying on
the local spin density approximation with the Vosko,
Wilk and Nusair parametrization for the exchange and
correlation potential.25 The electronic structure is de-
scribed,
including all relativistic eﬀects, by the Dirac

2

equation, which is solved using the spin-polarized rel-
ativistic multiple-scattering or Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
(KKR) Green function formalism26 as implemented in
the sprkkr code.27 The potential was treated within the
atomic sphere approximation (ASA). For the multipole
expansion of the Green function, the angular momen-
tum cutoﬀ ℓmax=3 was used. The energy integrals were
evaluated by contour integration on a semicircular path
within the complex energy plane using a Gaussian mesh
of 32 points. The integration over the k points was done
on a regular mesh, using 10000 points in the full surface
Brillouin zone.

This work deals with adatoms and monolayers on a
substrate. The Green function formalism allows to treat
the substrate as truly semi-inﬁnite: the electronic struc-
ture is relaxed within the topmost seven substrate lay-
ers while at the bottom of this relaxation zone the elec-
tronic structure is matched to the bulk via the decima-
tion technique. Monolayers are dealt with in the same
manner as the clean substrate, just adding a layer of 3d
atoms on top. The vacuum is represented by four lay-
ers of empty spheres. Adatoms are treated as embedded
impurities: ﬁrst one calculates the electronic structure of
a semi-inﬁnite host and then solves the Dyson equation
for an embedded impurity cluster.28 The impurity clus-
ters we used contain 62 sites in total; this includes one
3d adatom, 25 substrate atoms and the rest are empty
spheres.

The MAE is calculated as a diﬀerence of total energies

for M k ˆx and M k ˆz,

EMCA = E(x) − E(z) .

(2)

Accordingly, a positive MAE means that the easy axis of
magnetization is out-of-plane.

If the Dirac equation is used, the inﬂuence of SOC can-
not be isolated in a straightforward way. One can achieve
it, nevertheless, using an approximate two-component
scheme29 where the SOC-related term is identiﬁed via
relying on a set of approximate radial Dirac equations.
This scheme was used in the past to investigate the inﬂu-
ence of SOC on various properties including the MAE.6
In this work we use this scheme to suppress the SOC
when investigating the DOS in Sec. III B. If SOC is to
be included, the DOS can be calculated either using the
full Dirac equation or using the approximative scheme;29
the corresponding curves in the graphs agree within the
thickness of the line, demonstrating that both schemes
are equivalent as concerns the DOS. On the other hand,
there are small yet identiﬁable diﬀerences between both
schemes concerning the MAE (about 10 % in case of
adatoms and about 20 % in case of monolayers). The
results presented in Sec. III A were obtained using the
fully relativistic scheme.

allel to the surface for Ni adatom and monolayer. The
magnetic moments were evaluated within atomic spheres
around the 3d atoms. Magnetic moments for Au atoms
are small.
In case of adatoms, the total magnetic mo-
ment induced in the Au substrate amounts to about 5 %
of the 3d adatom moment and is oriented parallel to the
moment of the adatom. In the case of monolayers, the
total magnetic moment induced in the Au substrate per
a 3d atom is about 2 % of the 3d atom moment and is
oriented antiparallel to the moments of the 3d atoms.

The spin moments µspin practically do not depend on
the magnetization direction, while the orbital moments
µorb strongly depend on it. For Fe and Ni atoms, µorb
is signiﬁcantly larger if M is parallel to the easy axis of
the magnetization than if M is parallel to the hard axis
— in agreement with the expectations based on second
order perturbation theory.7–9 Surprisingly, this is not the
case for Co, where for the adatom the value of µorb only
slightly depends on the M direction and for the mono-
layer the trend is even reversed.

B. Density of states

We ﬁrst look at the spin-projected density of states
in a range covering the whole valence region. This is
presented in Fig. 2. The data correspond to M k ˆz but
the plot would look practically the same also for M k ˆx
at this scale. There is a considerable overlap between
3d majority-spin states and Au states,
implying that
majority-spin states are aﬀected by hybridization while
minority-spin states are more atomic-like.

One can see that the majority-spin states are nearly
fully occupied. The Fermi level EF is around the middle
of the minority-spin band. Thus if we are interested in
possible eﬀects of shifting the states across EF , we should
focus on the inﬂuence of the SOC on the minority-spin
states. Restricting ourselves to the minority-spin states
will greatly simplify further analysis without missing the
important aspects.

Investigated systems

We investigated Fe, Co, and Ni adatoms and mono-
layers on the fcc Au(111) surface. The corresponding
structures are shown in Fig. 1. To get proper interatomic
distances, we performed geometry optimization using the
vasp code.30,31 These calculations were done for slabs of
three layers of substrate atoms covered either by a com-
plete layer of 3d atoms (for monolayers) or by a 3×3 sur-
face supercell of 3d atoms (for adatoms). The positions
of the substrate atoms in the two lowermost layers were
ﬁxed while the positions of topmost substrate atoms and
3d atoms were relaxed. This led to a mild buckling of the
topmost Au layer for the adatoms (about 0.02 ˚A), which
we ignored in subsequent KKR-Green function calcula-
tions. The optimized structural parameters as we took
them from vasp calculations and used in the sprkkr
calculations are summarized in Tab. I. As concerns the
distances between Au substrate layers, we used the bulk
interatomic distance 2.396 ˚A everywhere except for the
distance for the topmost Au layer, which we took 2.431 ˚A
for adatoms and 2.427 ˚A for monolayers (as obtained via
the vasp calculations).

III. RESULTS

A. MAE and magnetic moments

The results obtained for the MAE and magnetic mo-
ments are presented in Tab. II. One can see that the
easy axis of the magnetization is perpendicular to the
surface for Fe and Co adatoms and monolayers and par-

tion of the magnetization requires some clariﬁcations.
The projection of the DOS according to the quantum
number m has to be done always in the same reference
frame, disregarding the orientation of M . We call this
frame the “global reference frame” — it is ﬁxed to the un-
derlying crystal lattice. If the m-projections are done in
diﬀerent reference frames for diﬀerent magnetization di-
rections, the deﬁnitions of the m-components themselves
also vary, because they are linked to the spherical har-
monics Yℓm which are deﬁned with respect to the x, y,
z axes. On the other hand, if one wants to retain and
emphasize the diﬀerence between spin-up and spin-down
contributions to the DOS, one has to make the projection
in a “local reference frame”, rotated so that the z axis
coincides with the magnetization direction. The need for
this can be easily seen from the Stern-Gerlach term in
the Pauli equation, σ · B, which is diagonal only if the
eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld B is parallel to the z axis. If the
spin quantization axis is not parallel to the magnetiza-
tion direction, the chosen representation strongly mixes
spin-up and spin-down components.

These two circumstances suggest that if one wants to
study the DOS for diﬀerent directions of the magne-
tization M , one has to renounce either having a uni-

versal deﬁnition of the m-projections or retaining well-
separated spin-resolved DOS components. This is not an
issue if the SOC is ignored because then the direction of
the magnetization has no eﬀect on the electronic struc-
ture anyway. However, if the SOC is accounted for and
the dependence of the DOS on the direction of M is in
focus, this is a serious obstacle.

Fortunately, this restriction can be by-passed in our
case. It is possible to get well-deﬁned spin-minority DOS
m-decomposed in a global reference frame even if M
is is not parallel to the z axis, relying on an approxi-
mate procedure which is described in appendix A. The
procedure combines results for an m-decomposition in
global and local reference frames. Employing this tech-
nique, we obtained the density of minority-spin d-states
resolved according to the magnetic quantum number m
as shown in Figs. 3–5. The magnetization is either out-
of-plane (M k ˆz, θ=0◦) or in-plane (M k ˆx, θ=90◦) and
the m-projections are deﬁned in the same (global) refer-
ence frame in both cases. To highlight the eﬀect of the
SOC, we present results obtained with SOC suppressed
and with SOC accounted for.

It can be seen readily from the plots in Figs. 3–5 that if
the SOC is suppressed, the DOS does not depend on the

sign of m. Components for +|m| and −|m| are the same
in this case, the only splitting comes from the crystal
ﬁeld.
If the SOC is taken into account, then the DOS
further depends on whether m is positive or negative.
There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in how the ±|m| states
are split for out-of-plane magnetization and for in-plane
magnetization (especially for the m=±2 case).

The procedure outlined in appendix A can be applied
only if the SOC-induced splitting of the majority-spin
states is negligible in the energy region in which we are
interested in, i.e., around EF . This assumption is well
justiﬁed for Fe and Co. However, it is not so good for Ni,
where the exchange-splitting is quite small (cf. Fig. 2)
and the inﬂuence of the SOC on the majority-spin DOS
is signiﬁcant up to about 0.5 eV below EF . Therefore,

for Ni we present the data only for for E > −0.6 eV and
even there they are less reliable than analogous data in
Figs. 3–4. The full energy range for M k ˆx is covered
by Figs. 9–11 in appendix B, where we present the m-
resolved DOS projected in a local reference frame rotated
so that the z(loc) axis is parallel to M .
In that case
the deﬁnitions of individual m-components is obviously
diﬀerent from that used in this section. One cannot,
therefore, directly compare the plots where the DOS was
resolved into m-components in the global reference frame
(Figs. 3–5) with plots where the DOS was resolved in the
local reference frame (appendix B). What is common in
both reference frames is that the SOC-induced splitting
of the ±|m| components it signiﬁcantly smaller for M k ˆx
than for M k ˆz.

Let us summarize the picture obtained by inspecting
the DOS. First, note that the minority-spin DOS for the

that for the adatoms there is indeed a sharp peak in the
MAE just at the energy where there is a peak for the
|m|=2 component in the case of no SOC. This is espe-
cially visible for Co and Ni adatoms. For the Fe adatom
this aspect is overshadowed by another strong feature
stemming from the fact that, in this case, also the |m|=1
states are aﬀected by SOC. The situation for monolayers
is more complicated because the m-components are not
atomic-like any more. Nevertheless, even here a strong
peak in the curve for EMAE as a function of Eband appears
at the energy where the DOS components for |m|=2 have
their maximum. We would like to note in this context
that the density of the Eband mesh used in the calculation
is the same for adatoms and monolayers. This means that
the observation that the EMAE(Eband) oscillations are
much wilder for monolayers than for adatoms describes
a real eﬀect. Probably this is connected with hybridiza-
tion between 3d atoms which is present for monolayers
but absent for adatoms.

C. Eﬀect of SOC on the energy levels via model

Hamiltonian

FIG. 5. (Color online) Density of the minority-spin d states
resolved according to the magnetic quantum number m and
the dependence of the MAE on the position of the top of the
valence band for a Ni adatom (left graphs) and a Ni monolayer
(right graphs) on Au(111). Otherwise, this ﬁgure is analogous
to Fig. 3.

adatoms has quite an atomic character: if the SOC is sup-
pressed, it can be seen as representing just three broad-
ened atomic levels, depending on |m|. For monolayers,
the hybridization between states from diﬀerent 3d atoms
is considerable, so the DOS does not have an atomic char-
acter any more. The second point to emphasize is that
the inﬂuence of the SOC is signiﬁcantly larger for θ=0◦
than for θ=90◦. More speciﬁcally, for θ=0◦ the SOC
splits the m=±2 peak into two and shifts their positions
in diﬀerent directions while for θ=90◦, the peak positions
remain the same (only their intensities change).

The splitting of m-resolved DOS peaks by the SOC
suggests that the MAE could be very sensitive to the po-
sition of EF with respect to these peaks. Therefore we
calculated the MAE while varying the position of the top
of the valence band Eband, i.e., the band ﬁlling. The re-
sults are shown in top panels of Figs. 3–5. One can see

We could see in Sec. III B how the SOC splits electronic
states for diﬀerent orientations of the magnetization. Let
us check to what extent this can be described within a
simple model with only the crystal-ﬁeld eﬀects taken into
account. This corresponds to a situation where the elec-
tron feels only the Coulombic ﬁeld generated by charges
located at the positions of the nuclei.

To highlight the essential features, we restrict ourselves
to d electrons in an axial ﬁeld (corresponding to D4d, i.e.,
antiprism symmetry).
If there is no magnetic order or
SOC, the crystal-ﬁeld Hamiltonian is given as described
for example in the book of Bersuker32 [Eqs. (4.9)–(4.10)
and Tab. 4.1]. The Hamiltonian is determined by two
parameters (if the constant energy shift is omitted), re-
sulting in three spin-degenerate energy levels as given in
Tab. III. The order of levels E1, E2, and E3 depends on
the values of parameters P and Q. Levels E1 and E3 are
double degenerate. Non-zero terms of the crystal-ﬁeld
Hamiltonian are

Hamiltonian is represented by a 10×10 matrix.

The magnetization of the system is reﬂected by the ex-
change ﬁeld Hamiltonian H (ex). To distinguish between
two orientations of the magnetization, we keep the spin
quantization axis ﬁxed (parallel to z) and vary the Hamil-
tonian H (ex). The non-zero terms of H (ex) for M k ˆx are

The total Hamiltonian we have to diagonalize is

H = H (cry) + H (ex) + H (SOC) .

(7)

We want to apply this model for an adatom, where
the hybridization is small and the crystal-ﬁeld eﬀects will
be important. Looking at the adatom-related panels of
Figs. 3–5, we can see that in the absence of SOC the
minority-spin DOS indeed resembles three atomic-like en-
ergy levels, as in Tab. III. It is convenient to introduce
level spacings

∆2 ≡ E3 − E2 ,

parameters as

(11)

To simulate 3d adatoms on Au(111), one should read the
∆1, ∆2 splittings from Figs. 3–5 to get the values for the
parameters P , Q and the exchange splitting from Fig. 2
to get the parameter B using E↓ − E↑ = 2B. The SOC
parameters ξ can be obtained via ab-initio calculations.34
The appropriate values are given in Tab. IV.

A general idea how the SOC aﬀects the energy levels
can be obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (7) for
diﬀerent orientations of M while the SOC strength ξ is
gradually increased from zero to a realistic value. The
corresponding results are presented in Fig. 6 where we
show energy levels E↑(ξ) and E↓(ξ) for parameters given
in Tab. IV. The “proper” value of ξ for each element is
marked by a thin dashed line. To avoid confusion, we
should note that our categorizing of levels as E↑ or E↓ is
done just for convenience, by comparing their positions
to the spin-projected DOS shown in Fig. 2. We care only
about the energy levels in this context and not about the
wave functions, so the issue of mixed spin character for
θ=90◦, discussed in Sec. III B and in appendix A, does
not interfere with our analysis.

A prominent feature of Fig. 6 is that the eﬀect of ξ
is much less for in-plane magnetization (θ=90◦) than for
perpendicular magnetization (θ=0◦). This is especially
true for the lowest energy which corresponds to m=±2.
By comparing this observation to Figs. 3–5, we see that
the simple crystal-ﬁeld model indeed accounts for the
trends in the m-resolved DOS for the 3d adatoms.
It
is worth noting that if the exchange-ﬁeld parameter B
decreases (i.e., going from Fe to Co to Ni), the m=±2
energy levels split also for the θ=90◦ case (in-plane mag-
netization). A similar trend can be seen also in the DOS
in Sec. III B: the diﬀerence between m=±2 curves in the
lowermost left panels in Figs. 3–5 increases when going
from Fe to Co to Ni.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our aim was to investigate whether markers of MAE
can be seen in intuitive quantities such as the m-resolved
DOS. Figs. 3–5 (in conjunction with Figs. 9–11) show
how SOC aﬀects the DOS depending on the orientation of
the magnetization M . The corresponding changes in the
DOS can be linked to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
of adatoms. Particularly for the Fe and Co adatoms one
can see that for θ=0◦ the SOC splits the |m|=2 compo-
nent of the DOS in such a way that one of the peaks
is pushed above EF (or at least an essential part of it).
The band-energy contribution to the total energy is thus
substantially reduced. As this eﬀect does not occur for

FIG. 6. (Color online) Dependence of eigen-energies of the model Hamiltonian given by Eq. (7) on the SOC strength ξ for two
orientations of M . The model parameters for Fe, Co, and Ni adatoms are given in Tab. IV. Thin dashed lines mark ξ values
appropriate for each element. The zero of energy corresponds to the case with no magnetization and no crystal ﬁeld.

θ=90◦, the out-of-plane orientation of M is energetically
more favored and the corresponding MAE is positive, in
agreement with Tab. II

The SOC-induced splitting of the |m|=2 peak occurs
for θ=0◦ also for the Ni adatom. However, in that case
both peaks remain below EF and the change in the band-
energy is therefore much smaller. The inﬂuence of SOC
for the θ=90◦ case is best seen if the m-projection is done
in a rotated local reference frame, as in Fig. 11. This is
because the isolation of the minority-spin DOS in the
global reference frame cannot be done properly due to
the small energy separation between the majority-spin
and minority-spin states of Ni. The lowermost graphs in
Fig. 5 have to be seen as primarily illustrative in this re-
spect because they are aﬀected by the fact that majority-
spin states are still inﬂuenced by the SOC in this region.
Focusing on the unambiguous data in Fig. 11 one can
see that for θ=90◦ the states with |m(loc)|=2 are split
in such a way that part of one of the SOC-split peaks is
pushed above EF . This eﬀect overruns the corresponding
eﬀect on the |m|=2 states for θ=0◦ (Fig. 5) and, accord-
ingly, the easy axis of magnetization is in-plane for the
Ni adatom.

Eﬀects of this kind can hardly be identiﬁed for mono-
layers.
In this case the hybridization between the 3d
states distorts the atomic-like character of the states and
one would have to consider a lot of contributions, simi-
larly as if the E(k) band-structure of layered systems is
analyzed.12,14,16

The simple crystal ﬁeld model accounts qualitatively
for many aspects of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy

of adatoms, indicating that this anisotropy can be un-
derstood intuitively as an interplay between the axial
crystal ﬁeld, the exchange ﬁeld and the spin-orbit cou-
pling. However, there are also diﬀerences between the
pictures oﬀered by the model Hamiltonian and by the
DOS obtained from ab initio calculations. For exam-
ple, the model Hamiltonian suggests that for an in-plane
magnetization (θ=90◦), the splitting between the m=±1
levels is larger than the splitting between the m=±2 lev-
els (Fig. 6); however, we do not observe this feature in
Figs. 3–5. This means that eﬀects not included in the
simple model of Sec. III C, such as hybridization, are im-
portant as well.

It should be noted that by monitoring SOC-induced
changes in the DOS one accounts only for the band-
energy contribution to the total energy, omitting thus
the terms that explicitly depend on the change of the
potential upon rotation of M (see, e.g., chapter 6 of the
monograph of Weinberger35 for more details). This is
equivalent to relying on the so called force theorem. If
the MAE is evaluated accounting for the band energy
contribution only (by means of the torque method),36,37
we obtain EMCA=5.7 meV for the Fe adatom, 1.9 meV
for the Co adatom, and −0.8 meV for the Ni adatom.
Comparison with Tab. II that gives EMCA as a diﬀer-
ence of total energies shows that the change in the band
energy does not fully account for the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy but nevertheless constitutes a signiﬁcant part
of it. One should also keep in mind that the SOC-induced
splitting of the DOS is not the only way the band en-
ergy is changed upon rotation of M . For example, all

eﬀects contained in Eq. (1) contribute as well. Accord-
ingly, what has been done here is identifying and visual-
izing one important mechanism contributing to the mag-
netocrystalline anisotropy. We suggest (following earlier
hints)3,11,15–17 that this mechanism may be the domi-
nant one for some adatoms and small clusters on sur-
faces — including those that attracted a lot of attention
recently.21,23,38,39

Another interesting system to be mentioned in this
context is lithium nitridoferrate Li2[(Li1−xFex)N] which
attracted a lot of attention due to its very high mag-
netocrystalline anisotropy.11,40–42 This system can be
viewed as a collection of semi-isolated Fe impurities. A
similar eﬀect as the one investigated here could therefore
be important for Li2[(Li1−xFex)N] and attention was in-
deed paid to it in this respect.11,42 Generally, the mecha-
nism we explored here should be important whenever the
width of the electronic bands becomes comparable to the
SOC-induced changes in the orbital-resolved DOS upon
the rotation of the magnetization.

If the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is generated via
pushing some SOC-split levels across the Fermi level, it
must crucially depend on their mutual positions. Specif-
ically in our case, it must depend on the position of the
energy bands of the adatom with respect to the Fermi
level of the substrate (cf. also the top graphs of Figs. 3–
5). Therefore, one might be able to manipulate the MAE
by changing the substrate EF , e.g., via doping.

Even though the aim of this study is not to reproduce
experimental MAE for speciﬁc systems, it is useful to
compare our values of MAE with available experiments.
There are no data for adatoms on Au(111) but there have
been several experimental studies of Fe and Co layers on
Au(111). Before comparison with experiment is done, the
dipole or shape anisotropy energy for monolayers must
be given. It is −0.18 meV, −0.08 meV, and −0.01 meV
for Fe, Co, and Ni monolayer, respectively. These val-
ues are smaller than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy given in Tab. II. So we predict that Fe and Co
monolayers on Au(111) have out-of-plane easy axes of
magnetization and a Ni monolayer (for which there are
no experiments available) has an in-plane easy axis of
magnetization. Earlier calculations for a Co monolayer
on Au(111) predicted an in-plane easy axis of magneti-
zation for this system;6,43 the reason for the diﬀerence
is almost certainly the structural relaxation which was
accounted for here but not in the two earlier works.

Despite several experimental studies of magnetocrys-
talline anisotropy of Fe and Co layers on Au(111) done
in the past, drawing conclusions from them is not easy
or unambiguous because the growth conditions vary and
typically do not favor formation of a single monolayer.
A critical analysis of experiments is beyond our scope.
For a Fe monolayer it is probably safe to say that exper-
iment suggests an out-of-plane easy axis,44–47 as our cal-
culations do. For a Co monolayer, the situation is more
complicated. For bilayer islands on Au(111) one gets an
out-of-plane easy axis.48–50 Again growth conditions may

9

be crucial.51 No data seem to exist for a single monolayer
on Au(111). As a whole, even though we cannot verify
our results by a comprehensive comparison with experi-
ment, agreement with available data as well as the fact
that our values of MAE are in the same range of values
as those obtained for similar systems indicate that our
results are reliable and can be used as a basis for the
analysis we performed in Secs. III B and III C.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling on adatoms that only
weakly hybridize with a substrate consists in splitting
atomic-like levels that would be degenerate in its absence.
The splitting is much larger if the magnetization is ori-
ented perpendicular to the surface than if it is oriented
parallel to the surface and can be viewed as a combined
result of crystal ﬁeld, exchange splitting and spin-orbit
coupling. If the originally degenerate level is close to the
Fermi level, one of the peaks can be pushed above it,
decreasing thereby the energy of the system. This eﬀect
represents a signiﬁcant contribution to the magnetocrys-
talline anisotropy of adatoms.
If hybridization smears
out the atomic-like character of energy levels, as it is the
case for monolayers, this eﬀect is not so important.

Appendix A: Spin-resolved and m-resolved DOS for

M ∦ ˆz

It was argued in Sec. III B that if one wants to see
how individual m-components of the DOS are aﬀected
by the rotation of the magnetization M , one should per-
form the m-projections always in a global reference frame
so that the deﬁnitions of the m-components remain the
same. However, in case that M ∦ ˆz, projecting the DOS
in a global reference frame mixes the spin components
because the spin quantization axis is no longer parallel
to M . In this appendix we present a method to restore
the separation of spin components in the DOS even in
such a case. Our goal is achieved by a detour, combining
results of projections in the global and local reference
frames. Eﬀectively, it could be seen as a way to make
the spin-projection and the m-projection in diﬀerent ref-
erence frames.

Let us recall that inside an atomic sphere the DOS for
a spin channel can be represented by means of the Green

that the z(loc) axis is parallel to M . The way the DOS

Integration over the radial coordinate is implicitly as-
sumed.

We start by projecting the DOS in the local reference
frame, where M k ˆz(loc). In this way we perform the sep-
aration of the spin components. We assume that this
separation was performed “once for all times”, i.e., it will
be preserved during the whole subsequent procedure. All
the manipulations will be applied to minority-spin DOS
and to majority-spin DOS separately.
This requires a further comment.

By doing the
spin-projection in the rotated local reference frame, we
get spin-up and spin-down states assuming that the
spin quantization axis is in a general direction while
when dealing with the global reference frame, the spin-
quantization axis is ﬁxed and parallel to z. However, this
diﬀerence can be neglected in our case: we checked that
the spin-projected DOS (without any m-decomposion)
looks practically the same no matter whether the mag-
netization is in-plane or out-of-plane. As an illustration,
spin-projected DOS for a Co adatom and a Co mono-
layer is shown in Fig. 7 for two magnetization directions.
These spin projections were obtained in local reference
frames deﬁned so that the z(loc) axis is always parallel

10

to M . One can see that there is hardly any diﬀerence
between the DOS for M k ˆx and M k ˆz. Another hint that
the spin projections can be maintained upon rotating M
comes from the fact that if the magnetization is rotated,
the spin magnetic moments almost do not change. There
is a common experience that this is the case for all mag-
netic systems. By assuming that the spin-projected DOS
does not depend on the direction of the magnetization,
we make an eﬀective decoupling of spin and orbital de-
grees of freedom. This enables us to focus on changes
in the m-resolved components. A similar decoupling is
used, e.g., when deriving useful relations for the angular-
dependence of the magnetic dipole term Tz for analyzing
the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra.52,53

So far we have obtained minority-spin DOS and
majority-spin DOS, m-resolved in the local frame. Now
we need to transform the spin-polarized DOS from the
to the basis spanned by Y (glo)

.
A straightforward transformation between the n(loc)
and
the n(glo)
components is generally not possible — one al-
ways has to start with the Green function G to get nL
in a new basis. However, the transformation can be done
provided that G is diagonal in the basis in which nL has
been initially known. Indeed, if we assume that

pending on the symmetry of the system). Fortunately,
non-diagonal elements of hY (glo)
i are small and
can be neglected for the systems we are dealing with. We
is obtained from n(glo)
veriﬁed this explicitly: If n(loc)
by the transformation (A4), the m-resolved DOS curves
obtained thereby agree within the thickness of the line
with curves obtained directly from the Green function
via Eq. (A3).
It should be noted that this veriﬁcation
ought to be applied to a sum of the spin components, be-
cause for M ∦ ˆz the spin components in n(glo)
are mixed
if they are evaluated directly. Additionally, the SOC has
to be suppressed to get exact equalities.

So far we found a transformation from the global frame
to the local frame. However, we started our procedure by
ﬁnding spin-projected DOS in the local reference frame,
so we need an opposite transformation, from the local
frame to the global frame. A procedure analogous to
that we used to derive Eqs. (A4) and (A5) cannot be
used, because if the Green function is evaluated in the
rotated local reference frame, its non-diagonal elements
hY (loc)
i cannot be neglected (the z(loc) axis of
the rotated frame is chosen in an “inconvenient” way
— parallel to the surface). That means we have only
Eq. (A4) at our disposal and the transformation from
n(loc)

has to be accomplished by inverting it.

The inversion of the transformation matrix U deﬁned
by Eq. (A5) cannot be done straightforwardly because
this matrix is singular. However, the singular 5×5 ma-
trix U of Eq. (A5) can be folded down to a regular 3×3
matrix U (fold) if we assume that the m-components do
not depend on the sign of m, i.e., if

(A11)
From the way the transformation Eq. (A11) was de-
rived it follows that it can be used only if the m-resolved

DOS for the +|m| states is the same as the DOS for the
“−|m| states”. As a whole, this is not the case because
the SOC splits the “±|m| states”. Therefore, one cannot
simply apply the transformation (A11) to the minority-
spin DOS m-resolved in the local reference frame to get
the minority-spin DOS m-resolved in the global refer-
ence frame: the minority-spin ±|m|-states are split by
the SOC, therefore the folding of Eq. (A4) to Eq. (A7)
cannot be done and the unfolding of the matrix (A9) to
a full matrix (A10) cannot be done either. However, in
the energy region we are interested in, i.e., in the region
where the minority-spin states dominate, there is only
little SOC-induced splitting of the ±|m|-states for the
majority-spin. This can be checked explicitly by look-
ing on the m-resolved majority-spin DOS curves in the
energy region around Fermi level. As an example, we
show here the m=-2 and m=+2 DOS components for
a Co adatom and a Co monolayer (Fig. 8). We select
the case for M k ˆz, where the SOC-induced splitting is
the largest. One can see that indeed the splitting of the
majority-spin DOS (labeled by n↑) around EF is much
less than the splitting of the minority-spin DOS (labeled
by n↓). So even though the transformation (A11) cannot
be applied to the minority-spin DOS, it can be applied
to the majority-spin DOS.

The m-resolved minority-spin DOS in the global refer-
ence frame can thus be recovered in the following way:
First, let us evaluate the m-resolved DOS directly in the
global reference frame, as indicated in Eq. (A2). Both
global spin channels are strongly mixed for in-plane mag-
netization, so there is only a very small diﬀerence be-
tween “spin-up” and “spin-down” m-resolved DOS com-
ponents; if there is no SOC, even this diﬀerence disap-
pears. By adding contributions from both spin chan-
nels, we get a “total” m-resolved DOS in a global frame,
with spin components unresolved. In a second step, we
take the m-resolved DOS in the local (rotated) reference
frame, keep only its majority-spin component and trans-
form it to the global reference frame via Eq. (A11). This
provides us with a well-deﬁned majority-spin m-resolved
DOS in the global reference frame. Finally, we subtract
this majority-spin DOS m-resolved in a global frame from
the total m-resolved DOS obtained in the ﬁrst step. This
leaves us with minority-spin m-resolved DOS in a ba-
sis deﬁned in the global reference frame. This detour
(getting minority-spin DOS by subtracting majority-spin
DOS from the total DOS) provides more accurate values
than what would be obtained if the transformation (A11)
was applied to the minority-spin DOS, because the con-
dition (A6) is satisﬁed much better for the majority-spin
states than for the minority-spin states in the energy re-
gion of interest.

The procedure described in this appendix should be
used only for systems where there is a substantial ex-
change splitting between the majority-spin and minority-
spin states. Only then one can neglect the SOC-induced
±|m| splitting of the majority-spin states with respect
to the splitting of the minority-spin states (for energies

FIG. 9.
(Color online) The d-component of the minority-
spin DOS for a Fe adatom (left) and a Fe monolayer (right)
on Au(111) for magnetization parallel to the surface, with
SOC either ignored (top) or included (bottom). The DOS is
resolved according to the magnetic quantum number m in a
local reference frame where the z(loc) axis is parallel to the
Au(111) surface.

where the minority-spin DOS is much larger than the
majority-spin DOS). This is why our procedure works
nicely for Fe and Co but not so well for Ni, as explained
in Sec. III B.

Appendix B: DOS for M k ˆx resolved in a local

reference frame

The DOS presented in Sec. III B was resolved accord-
ing to the magnetic quantum number m in a global refer-
ence frame, with the z axis perpendicular to the surface.
This ensured the same meaning of the m-components no
matter how the magnetization is oriented. However, one
had to apply an additional procedure described in ap-
pendix A to resolve the spin components. As this proce-
dure assumes that SOC does not split the majority-spin
DOS which is not quite the case here (especially for sys-
tems with low exchange splitting such as Ni adatom and
monolayer), one might wonder whether the conclusions
based on Figs. 3–5 can be trusted.

Therefore, we present in this appendix the m-resolved
DOS for M k ˆx where the magnetic quantum number m
refers to a local reference frame, with the spin quantiza-
tion axis z(loc) parallel to M . The outcome is presented
in Figs. 9–11. Note that the individual m-components
cannot be directly compared to analogous components
in Figs. 3–5 because their deﬁnitions diﬀer. This can be
clearly seen when comparing the DOS for systems with-
out SOC: in that case there can be in principle no depen-
dence on the magnetization direction and yet graphs for
θ=0◦ shown in Sec. III B diﬀer from analogous graphs for

θ=90◦ in this appendix — because the magnetic quantum
numbers are deﬁned with respect to diﬀerent reference
frames.

Even though the m-components are deﬁned diﬀerently,
one can still qualitatively compare how SOC aﬀects the
DOS for θ=0◦ and for θ=90◦. Concerning the situation
for θ=0◦, one monitors in Figs. 3–5 how the plot with-
out SOC changes if SOC is switched on (i.e., one looks
at the two middle panels of the corresponding ﬁgure).
Concerning the situation for θ=90◦, one monitors analo-
gous changes in Figs. 9–11. One can clearly see that the
eﬀect of SOC is much more pronounced for θ=0◦ than
for θ=90◦. This conﬁrms and strengthens the conclu-
sions drawn in Sec. III B, where the emphasis was put
rather on maintaining the possibility for a component-
by-component comparison than on formal correctness.
