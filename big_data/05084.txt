Abstract. We recall that the Brill-Noether Theorem gives necessary and suﬃcient condi-
d. Here we consider a general n-fold, ´etale, cyclic cover p : ˜C → C

a Castelnuovo canonical curve) and the theory of limit linear series for tree-like curves we

only slightly weaker than the suﬃcient condition given by the results of Laksov and Kleimann
[KL], for all n, r, d.

1. Introduction and main results

We recall the Brill-Noether theorem for curves (which in this paper are always assumed to

be complete reduced algebraic over C). If the Brill-Noether number

ρ(g, r, d) := g − (r + 1)(g − d + r)

(1.1)

r
is non-negative, then any smooth curve C of genus g carries a g
d, i.e. a linear series of
dimension r and degree d. This existence result is due to [K], [KL], see also [FL]. For
general curves this suﬃcient condition is also necessary. This is the content of the classical
Brill-Noether theorem, ﬁrst proved rigorously in [GH], and subsequently in e.g. [EH1], [L].

In this paper we show a Brill-Noether-like theorem for cyclic covers p : ˜C → C, where more
precisely p is a ﬁnite, ﬂat, unramiﬁed morphism between smooth curves which has degree n
and a cyclic Galois group. We recall that, if C has genus g, such covers form an irreducible
moduli space Rg,n whose birational geometry has been studied recently, see [CEFS]. A general
point in this space is a cyclic cover of a general curve C of genus g. We obtain the following
non-existence result.

Theorem 1.1. Let p : ˜C → C be a general cyclic cover of a curve of genus g. If the Brill-
Noether number satisﬁes the inequality

ρ(˜g, r, d) < −r,

(1.2)

where ˜g = n(g − 1) + 1 is the genus of ˜C, then ˜C carries no g

r
d.

This theorem immediately yields the following useful results.

Theorem 1.2. Let p : ˜C → C be as above and assume that r + 1 divides ˜g. Then a general
˜C has a g

r
d if and only if

ρ(˜g, r, d) > 0.

(1.3)

In fact, there exists a d such that ρ(˜g, r, d) = 0, if and only if r + 1 divides ˜g. For this d we
r
have ρ(˜g, r, d − k) = −k(r + 1). So by the existence result of [K], [KL], there will be a g
d on
˜C, but - by Theorem 1.1 - no g
r
d−k for positive k. Since ρ(˜g, r, d) is strictly monotone in d, we
are done.

In the case r = 1 the Brill-Noether theorem gives an estimate for the gonality of ˜C, deﬁned

as

gon( ˜C) := min{d ∈ N; there exists a g

1

d on ˜C}.

We recall from the discussion of the Brill-Noether theorem that in the classical language of
Riemann surfaces gon(C) is the minimal number of sheets needed in a representation of C as
a branched cover of P1 which is

d = ⌊

⌋ + 1.

g + 1

In our case of cyclic covers we have the following result:

Theorem 1.3. Let p : ˜C → C be a general cover as above. Then the following estimate holds

˜g + 1

2

=

n(g − 1)

2

+ 1 6 gon( ˜C) 6

n(g − 1)

2

+ 2 =

˜g + 3

2

.

(1.4)

In fact, for r = 1 the smallest d such that ˜C has a g

d will satisfy −1 6 ρ(˜g, 1, d) 6 1 (using
Theorem 1.1 for the lower and the existence result of [K], [KL] for the upper bound). This is
equivalent to the estimate (1.4).

1

As a further consequence of Theorem 1.2, this estimate can in certain cases be sharpened.

Corollary 1.4. For p : ˜C → C as above, with n odd and g even, we have

gon( ˜C) =

n(g − 1) + 3

2

.

(1.5)

The upper bound on gon(C) - for each smooth genus g curve - was the ﬁrst rigorous result
on the Brill-Noether problem (see [M] with its analytic proof). The lower bound has until
now only been proven by methods from algebraic geometry. Our Theorem 1.3 extends this
result to curves which are general in the class of cyclic covers.

Concerning previous results on Brill- Noether theory for cyclic covers, we recall [AF], which
treats the case r = 1 and n = 2, i.e. gonality for cyclic double covers, and obtains a sharper
result computing gon( ˜C) in each case: For g even it is g, for g odd it is g + 1. Here [AF] uses
Proposition 1.4.1 in [F] on 2-pointed elliptic curves. We do not see how this argument could
be mimicked even in the case n = 2, r > 1. This motivated our search for a diﬀerent approach
which ﬁnally led to this work using Pl¨ucker’s formula instead.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the preliminaries needed
to prove our theorems: the moduli space Rg,n, limit linear series and Castelnuovo canonical
curves. All this (except for the use of Pl¨ucker’s formula and some further results on moduli
spaces of cyclic covers) is very close to the approach in [EH1], which simpliﬁes the original
rigorous proof of the Brill-Noether theorem given in [GH], all based on degeneration to a
singular curve. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1.1.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. The moduli space Rg,n. In this paper we will work in the moduli space Rg,nof cyclic
covers as explained in the introduction.
In the more traditional language of complex analysis a cyclic cover may be considered as a
principal Zn-bundle, where the action is the action of the monodromy group.

By the Hurwitz formula for any cyclic cover p : ˜C → C (which is unramiﬁed by deﬁnition),
the genus of ˜C will be ˜g = n(g − 1) + 1, if the genus of C is g. From now on, we keep this
relation between ˜g, g, n ﬁxed and we use only g, n as the free variables in our problem.

There is a bijection between cyclic covers and level n curves. See [H] chapter IV exercise

2.7 for the case n = 2, and, for general n, [S] or [BHPV] for a brief discussion. We need:

Deﬁnition 2.1. A level n curve (of genus g) or a curve with level n structure is a
pair (C, L) consisting of a smooth curve C (of genus g) together with an n-torsion point L of
its Jacobian, i.e L ∈ Pic0(C) a point of order n in the group Pic0(C).

We recall that (e.g. based on the theory of stacks) one obtains a coarse moduli space Rg,n

of level n curves, see [CF]. We shall need the following result:

Theorem 2.2. Rg,n is irreducible.

The proof in the seminal paper [DM] is given for the moduli space of curves with full level
n structure (which is smooth). But the intermediate space Rg,n arises as a ﬁnite quotient and
thus inherits irreducibility, see [B].

In this paper we will also require a compactiﬁcation Rg,n of Rg,n. It turns out that Rg,n
arises as the coarse moduli space of twisted level n curves, deﬁned as a connected component
of Mg(BZn), which itself arises as the coarse moduli space of the category M g(BZn) of twisted
nth roots, which forms a smooth and proper Deligne-Mumford stack. For our notation see
e.g. [CEFS], using results from [ACV] and [AV].

Since coarse moduli spaces are suﬃcient for our purpose in this paper, we shall simply take
for granted the existence of Rg,n as a compactiﬁcation of Rg,n, without amplifying what kind
of geometric objects are parametrized by this space. For our purpose it is suﬃcient to look at
the closely related moduli space Admg(Zn) of admissible Zn-covers, which are geometrically
more accessible, and describe this space in geometric terms. We will not go into detail on the
geometry of these two moduli spaces and their relation to each other. For this paper we only
need to know that there is a surjective morphism Rg,n → Admg(Zn); see the Diagram 2.1.
Deﬁnition 2.3. An admissible Zn-cover is a morphism p : ˜C → C of stable curves together
with a p-invariant (i.e. ﬁbre preserving) action of Zn on ˜C such that:

(1) every node of ˜C maps to a node of C
(2) away from the nodes p is a principal Zn-bundle
(3) for any node x ∈ ˜C there is an integer r > 0 and a local equation ξη = 0 of ˜C at x, such
that any element of the stabilizer of x under the action of Zn acts as (ξ, η) 7→ (ζξ, ζ −1η),
where ζ is an rth root of unity.

4

IRENE SCHWARZ

The integer r is called the index of x.

By conjugation it easily follows that every node of ˜C lying above the same node of C has

the same index. This index can be considered as a ramiﬁcation index. So an admissible
Zn- cover will be unramiﬁed, if and only if every node has index 1.

It is clear from the deﬁnition that for an admissible Zn-cover p : ˜C → C of a smooth curve
C, ˜C is also smooth and p is simply a principal Zn-bundle, which corresponds to a cyclic cover.
We shall denote the subset (in fact subscheme) of Admg(Zn) of such isomorphism classes of
principal Zn-bundles as P Zn.

For the notion of families of admissible Zn-covers and an explicit construction of the coarse
moduli space Admg(Zn) of admissible Zn-covers see [ACG]. This construction uses Kuranishi
families of admissible Zn covers and largely resembles the construction of the moduli space
Mg, avoiding the use of algebraic (or Deligne-Mumford) stacks. Thus it is both more elemen-
tary and geometrically accessible, but, if one so wishes, this moduli space can be identiﬁed
with a moduli space arising in the algebraically more powerful theory of stacks. In the no-
tation of [CEFS], the Deligne-Mumford stack Rootg,n of quasi-stable nth roots (see also [J1],
[J2]) is relevant. We also refer to Remark 1.6 in [CF] for the relation between stacks and
admissible covers.

There are two forgetful maps (which are morphisms of schemes) Admg(Zn) → Mg and
Admg(Zn) → M˜g that map the isomorphism class of an admissible Zn-cover p : ˜C → C to
the isomorphism class of C or ˜C. Our proof only needs the map Admg(Zn) → M˜g.

The crucial point of this very brief review is that one obtains the following commutative

diagram

where ։ is a surjective morphism and ֒→ an inclusion. This is implicit in the discussion
of [CEFS], combining the results of Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 (generalizing from n prime
to arbitrary natural numbers n; for arbitrary n there are additional singularities due to the
factorization). This diagram is essential for our proof. On the left hand side we have irre-
ducibility due to [DM], via stacks, and in the middle we have a geometric description which
will ﬁt with the theory of limit linear series in the following section.

2.2. Limit linear series. Our proof will rely largely on degenerating a family of linear series
on smooth curves to a singular curve. For this we need the theory of limit linear series.

For the theory of families of linear series we refer to [ACG], chapter XXI.
We recall that (using the determinantal description of varieties of linear series) the existence

d(Mg) := {C ∈ Mg | C carries a g

d is a closed condition, i.e. the set Gr

r
of a g
subscheme of Mg.

To prepare our discussion of limit linear series on a (single) tree-like curve (where the
r
irreducible components might be nodal) we need to characterize how a single g
d on a single,
possibly singular, curve behaves at a smooth point.

Deﬁnition 2.4. For a curve C, a smooth point x ∈ C and a linear series ℓ = (L, V ) ∈ Gr
d(C)
we deﬁne the vanishing sequence of ℓ at x, 0 6 a0(ℓ, x) < a1(ℓ, x) < · · · < ar(ℓ, x) 6 d, as
the strictly increasing order of vanishing of sections of ℓ in x, i.e.

{ai(ℓ, x) | i = 0, . . . , r} = {ordp(σ) | σ ∈ V, σ 6= 0}.

(2.2)

The ramiﬁcation sequence of ℓ at x, 0 6 α0(ℓ, x) 6 α1(ℓ, x) 6 · · · 6 αr(ℓ, x) 6 d − r, is
deﬁned by setting

The weight or ramiﬁcation index of ℓ at x is

αi(ℓ, x) := ai(ℓ, x) − i.

αi(ℓ, x) =

ai(ℓ, x) −

r(r + 1).

(2.3)

(2.4)

Finally, we recall the Pl¨ucker formula, which in the following version is a crucial ingredient

of our proof, see e.g. [HM]:

r
Theorem 2.5. If ℓ is any g
d on a smooth and irreducible curve C of genus g, then the weights
will satisfy

wℓ(x) = (r + 1)(d + r(g − 1)).

(2.5)

X

x∈C

r
We remark that a g
d ℓ on C uniquely corresponds to a morphism of schemes f of degree
d from C to Pr. The ramiﬁcation points of ℓ coincide with the ramiﬁcation points of the
corresponding map f . For r = 1 the Pl¨ucker formula for ℓ is equivalent to the Riemann-
Hurwitz formula for f .

While the deﬁnition of linear series also works for singular and reducible curves, it is useful
r
only in the irreducible case. We recall from [EH2] that families of g
ds over families of smooth
curves degenerating to a reducible curve C0 do not behave well with respect to limits: On C0
r
r
r
d on
ds. On the other hand, given a g
d at all or several distinct g
one might obtain as limit no g
the singular ﬁbre C0, it might not be possible to smooth it out, i.e. to embed it into a family
r
of g
ds where the singular ﬁbre is removed.

r
d rectiﬁes both problems (the second problem in full generality only
The concept of a limit g
for r = 1, for r > 1 under some mild additional conditions). Here we shall only need the ﬁrst
(more elementary) point: Limits of linear series are Limit linear series. To make the limit
unique, it is very natural to consider only 1-dimensional families of curves and associated
r
r
1-dimensional families of g
ds with these
ds (see [H], Proposition III 9.8). However limit g
properties are only deﬁned for a certain kind of nodal curves called tree-like.

We recall that a nodal curve C is called of compact type, if the dual graph of C is a tree or
equivalently if the Jacobian J(C) is compact. A nodal curve C is called tree-like if its dual
graph is connected and has no cycles except, possibly, for loops.

The following notion of limit linear series will be central for our proof. It allows to treat
singular (in particular: reducible) curves and relates them to a degeneration through a family

6

IRENE SCHWARZ

of smooth curves. The original theory is due to Eisenbud and Harris (see [EH2]) and was
originally only developed for curves of compact type. Since then it has been extended to
tree-like curves (in [EH3]).

r
Deﬁnition 2.6. Let C be a tree-like curve. A limit linear series (or limit g
d) ℓ of degree
d and dimension r assigns to every irreducible component X of C a linear series ℓX ∈ Gr
d(X)
called the aspect of ℓ on X, such that for every pair of distinct irreducible components X, Y ⊂
C meeting in the node x the aspects satisfy for all i

ai(ℓX, x) + ar−i(ℓY , x) > d.

(2.6)

If equality holds everywhere the limit linear series ℓ is called reﬁned.

We recall that in [EH2] our limit linear series are called crude. The important thing about
limit linear series is that they arise as limits of linear series. To make this more precise con-
sider the following situation: Let B be a regular, integral scheme of dimension 1, b0 ∈ B a
closed point and U = B \ {b0}. For example B might be a smooth curve or the spectrum of
a discrete valuation ring. Consider a family of stable curves φ : X → B such that the ﬁbre
C0 over b0 is tree-like and the family is smooth everywhere else, i.e. φ|U is a family of smooth
curves.

r
Now let (LU , HU )- in the notation of [ACG]- be a family of g
ds on φ|U .
Then for every irreducible component of C0 the line bundle LU on φ−1(U) ⊂ X can be
uniquely extended to a line bundle L on X , such that L|C0 has degree d on this component
r
ds on the irreducible components
and degree 0 on all other components. Then HU will induce g
r
of C0. These will turn out to form a unique limit g
d on C0.

r
d for the case that B is the spectrum of
In [EH2], Eisenbud and Harris construct the limit g
a discrete valuation ring and the special ﬁbre is of compact type. In [EH3] they extend this
to a more general situation, but without giving a detailed proof. In particular, they claim:

Lemma 2.7. Let B be a regular, integral scheme of dimension 1, b0 ∈ B a closed point and
U = B \ {b0}. Let φ : X → B be a family of stable curves such that the ﬁbre C0 over b0
is tree-like and the family is smooth everywhere else, i.e. φ|U is a family of smooth curves.
r
r
If (LU , HU ) is a family of g
d on C0 which
ds on φ|U , then there exists a unique crude limit g
arises as the limit of (LU , HU ).

We will need the following result, which (if B consists of more than 2 points) is slightly
stronger than the contra-position of the statement in Lemma 2.7. The easy special case
mentioned above is the important case of B being a discrete valuation ring consisting of one
open and one closed point. We also could have reduced our proof to this special case, but we
feel that the more general case is more geometrical and ﬁts more naturally in the discussion
of moduli spaces. Since we need the generalization of [EH2] to tree-like curves anyway, we
have formulated a general result.

r
Proposition 2.8. In the setting of Lemma 2.7, if C0 does not carry a crude limit g
d, then
r
the general smooth ﬁbre Cb of φ does not carry a g
d.

BRILL-NOETHER THEORY FOR CYCLIC COVERS

The idea of a proof is as follows. Similar to Gr

d(Mg) in Mg, one considers families of limit

linear series and shows that the space

Gr

r
d(Mg) := {C ∈ Mg | C carries a limit-g
d}

is closed in Mg.

Some of the most important applications of limit linear series are in using them to prove

theorems on general smooth curves. A typical example (needed in our proof) is:

r
Lemma 2.9. A general pointed curve (C, x) of genus g possesses a g
d with ramiﬁcation
sequence 0 6 α0(ℓ, x) 6 α1(ℓ, x) 6 · · · 6 αr(ℓ, x) 6 d − r at x, if and only if

max{αi + g − d + r, 0} 6 g.

(2.7)

For a proof see [EH3], Proposition 1.2. The proof of suﬃciency of (2.7) uses the smoothing
out result for limit linear series, the proof of necessity uses Lemma 2.7. Only this part is
needed for our proof.

2.3. Castelnuovo canonical curves. We shall introduce a special class of singular curves
(tree-like, but not of compact type) which will play an essential role in our proof of Theorem
1.1. These Castelnuovo canonical curves go back to Castelnuovo’s paper [C], see [GH] for a
modern reference. They have topological genus 0, but arithmetical genus g.

Deﬁnition 2.10. An irreducible curve of arithmetical genus g is called a Castelnuovo
canonical curve if and only if it has precisely g simple nodes.

Obviously such a curve is tree-like, since its dual graph consists of one vertex with g distinct

loops attached. Its normalization is P1.

Conversely, a Castelnuovo canonical curve is most easily constructed from its normalization
by selecting 2g diﬀerent points xj, yj for j = 1, · · · , g and identifying the points xj with yj,
which is also well deﬁned for reducible curves. This gives the normalization map

N : P1 → P1/x1 ∼ y1, · · · , xg ∼ yg.

r
Since Castelnuovo canonical curves are irreducible, it makes sense to consider g
ds deﬁned

r

on them. Any such g
d ℓ can be pulled back to a g

d on P1, and one has:

Lemma 2.11. The weights in smooth points coincide, i.e.

d on C, then

We have to show that for ﬁxed n, r, g, d and ˜g = n(g − 1) + 1 with

ρ(˜g, r, d) < −r,

(3.1)

Step 1: One singular example suﬃces

First note that Rg,n is irreducible by Theorem 2.2. Therefore every non-empty open set is

already dense. Now consider the Diagram 2.1 from Section 2.1.

Since the set

Gr

r
d(M˜g) = {C ∈ M˜g | C carries a g
d}

is closed, its preimage in Rg,n is also closed. Therefore, its complement V is open, and we are
reduced to showing that it is non-empty.

The map Rg,n ։ P Zn is surjective and it therefore suﬃces to exhibit a single principal Zn-
d on ˜C. Unfortunately, it seems impossible

bundle p : ˜C → C in P Zn, such that there is no g
to directly construct such a smooth example.

r

It is, however, possible to construct an admissible Zn-cover p0 : ˜C0 → C0 , such that there is
d on ˜C0. We claim that this proves the existence of some smooth example p : ˜C → C,

B, such that the special ﬁbre over some closed point b0 ∈ B corresponds to our singular
example p0 : ˜C0 → C0 and the family is smooth over B \ {b0}.

This family will induce a family ˜φ : X → B of stable curves of genus ˜g, which satisﬁes the
d on ˜C0 then by Proposition 2.8 there is some

By the construction of ˜φ it is clear that this ﬁbre came from some principal Zn-bundle

p : ˜C → C . This proves our claim.

Step 2: Singular examples and a preliminary estimate

We shall now construct singular examples.
Fix a general 1-pointed curve (C0, x) ∈ Mg−1,1 and a (possibly tree-like) elliptic 1-pointed

curve (E, y) ∈ M1,1, where y is a smooth point of E.

Fix also an admissible Zn-cover pE : ˜E → E over E and set {y1, · · · , yn} := p−1

E (y). By the

Hurwitz formula ˜E is also an elliptic curve.

Now choose n identical copies (C1, x1), · · · (Cn, xn) of (C0, x) and deﬁne the tree-like curves

C := C0 ∪ E/x ∼ y,

˜C := ˜E ∪ C1 ∪ · · · ∪ Cn/(x1 ∼ y1, · · · , xn ∼ yn).

(3.2)

Clearly this induces an admissible Zn-cover p : ˜C → C (with index r = 1 at each node).

(˜g − 1). This is equivalent to ρ(˜g, r, d) > −r(r + 2).

It is clear from Step 1 that the estimate can be optimized by choosing E and ˜E in a special
r
way. Thus we are led to optimizing the lower bound for d such that a g
d with given weights
w(yi) > r(g − 1) exists on a speciﬁc elliptic curve ˜E. Therefore we shall now choose E and ˜E
as Castelnuovo canonical curves.

This will allow us to lower the left hand side of (3.6) by pinching away the hole of the elliptic

curve and using the Pl¨ucker formula for g = 0.

We choose E and ˜E as the projective line with the points 0 and ∞ identiﬁed and denote

its normalisation by N : P1 → P1/0 ∼ ∞ = E = ˜E.

The map z 7→ zn on P1 induces an admissible Zn-cover pE : ˜E → E (with index r = n at

˜ℓ on ˜E can be pulled back to a g

Thus applying the Pl¨ucker formula (2.5) to ℓ gives the following estimate:

(r + 1)(d − r) = X

wℓ(x) >

x∈P1

n

X

i=1

wℓ(ζ i) =

n

X

i=1

˜ℓ(yi) >

w

n

X

i=1

r(g − 1) = rn(g − 1) = r(˜g − 1).

This is equivalent to d >

r

r + 1

(3.7)
(˜g − 1) + r and thus to ρ(˜g, r, d) > −r, proving Theorem 1.1.

This paper is a restructured and substantially shortened version of my diploma thesis [Sch]
written under the supervision of Prof. Farkas at the Humboldt University of Berlin. I want
to thank my advisor G. Farkas both for suggesting this interesting subject which allowed me

1If E is singular, the usual Pl¨ucker formula for singular curves replaces the ﬁrst equality in 3.6 by >, leading

to the same estimate.

to work and think about a real problem in algebraical geometry already during my diploma
thesis and for contributing crucial ideas to the proof.
