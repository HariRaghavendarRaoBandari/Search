Duality and contravariant functors in the representation theory of

artin algebras

Samuel Dean

March 21, 2016

Abstract

The model theory of modules leads to a way of obtaining deﬁnable categories of modules over
a ring R as the kernels of certain functors (R-Mod)op → Ab rather than of functors R-Mod → Ab
which are given by a pp pair. This paper will give various algebraic characterisations of these
functors in the case that R is an artin algebra.

Suppose that R is an artin algebra. An additive functor G : (R-Mod)op → Ab preserves inverses
limits and G|(R-mod)op : (R-mod)op → Ab is ﬁnitely presented if and only if there is a sequence of
natural transformations (−, A) → (−, B) → G → 0 for some A, B ∈ R-mod which is exact when
evaluated at any left R-module. Any additive functor (R-Mod)op → Ab with one of these equivalent
properties has a deﬁnable kernel, and every deﬁnable subcategory of R-Mod can be obtained as the
kernel of a family of such functors.

In the ﬁnal section a generalised setting is introduced, so that our results apply to more cate-
gories than those of the form R-Mod for an artin algebra R. That is, our results are extended to
those locally ﬁnitely presented K-linear categories whose ﬁnitely presented objects form a dualising
variety, where K is a commutative artinian ring.

Introduction

A deﬁnable subcategory of a module category R-Mod is the kernel of a family of additive functors
R-Mod → Ab, each of which is given by a pp pair (see [15, 1.1.2] or the description below for
the deﬁnition of a functor given by a pp pair, and see [15, 3.4.1] for algebraic characterisations
of deﬁnable subcategories). According to the following result, this model theoretic condition on
functors can be replaced by various algebraic conditions. For a pp pair ϕ/ψ in the language of left
ϕ/ψ : R-Mod → Ab, which takes a left R-
R-modules, we denote the corresponding functor by F
module M to ϕ(M )/ψ(M ), where ϕ(M ) and ψ(M ) are, respectively, the solution sets of ϕ and ψ
in M (ϕ(M ) and ψ(M ) are subgroups of M n for some positive integer n, and every pp formula is
preserved by homomorphisms, so F

ϕ/ψ is deﬁned on morphisms in the obvious way).

Theorem 1.1. (From [15, Subsection 10.2.8] and [10, Section 1.2]) For an additive functor F :
R-Mod → Ab, the following are equivalent.

(a) F preserves direct limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to R-mod.
(b) There is a sequence of natural transformations

(B, −)

/ (A, −)

/ F

/ 0

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module, where A and B are ﬁnitely presented left
R-modules.

(c) F ∼= F

ϕ/ψ for some pp pair ϕ/ψ.

The above theorem holds when R is any ring, but suppose that R is an artin algebra. Under this
assumption, we will prove an analogous result which gives necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for
a functor (R-Mod)op → Ab to be given by a pp pair. Furthermore, we will show that any functor
(R-Mod)op → Ab which satisﬁes these conditions has a deﬁnable kernel, and that every deﬁnable
subcategory of R-Mod can be obtained as the kernel of a family of such functors. Therefore, we
have a new way of conﬁrming the deﬁnability of certain categories in this context. However, the key
ingredient is dualisation, so we now introduce that.

2 Notation and preliminaries

2.1 Dualisation and predualisation of functors

Throughout this paper K will denote a commutative artinian ring unless stated otherwise.

Let J be the K-module

J =

n

M

i=1

E(Si)

where {Si : i = 1, . . . , n} is a minimal set of representatives of the simple left K-modules and
E(Si) denotes the injective hull of Si for each i = 1, . . . , n. In particular, if K is a ﬁeld then
J ∼= K. Note that J is an injective cogenerator of K-Mod (see, for example, [2, 18.2, 18.15]).

For a K-module M we deﬁne its dual to be the K-module M ∗ = HomK(M, J). For a linear
map f : M → N between K-modules M and N , we deﬁne its dual to be the induced linear map
f ∗ : N ∗ → M ∗ : t 7→ tf .

For any K-module M , there is a canononical K-linear map ηM : M → M ∗∗ which sends an

element x ∈ M to the linear map ηM (x) ∈ M ∗∗ given by ηM (x)(f ) = f (x) for all f ∈ M ∗.

It is well known (see [5, II.3]) that, for any ﬁnitely generated K-module M , M ∗ is ﬁnitely

generated and the canonical map ηM : M → M ∗∗ is an isomorphism.

For a K-linear category A, consider an additive functor F : A → Ab. It has a unique factorisa-
tion F = U F ′ where F ′ : A → K-Mod is K-linear and U : K-Mod → Ab is the forgetful functor.
So, for every object a ∈ A, F a has a hidden K-module structure, and every morphism in A is sent
to a K-linear map.1 Therefore, we can make the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let A be a K-linear category and let F : A → Ab be an additive functor. The dual
of F is the functor F ∗ : Aop → Ab which sends an object a ∈ A to (F a)∗ and sends a morphism
(f : a → b) ∈ A to the induced map

(F f )∗ : (F b)∗ → (F a)∗.

Example 2.2. If A = R, a K-algebra, in the previous deﬁnition, we recover the usual process of
obtaining a right R-module M ∗ from a left R-module M .

Since J is a cogenerator of K-Mod, M ∗ = 0 iff M = 0 for any K-module M . This fact is

crucial to later observations.

If R is an artin algebra over K then a left or right R-module is ﬁnitely generated iff it is ﬁnitely
presented iff it is ﬁnitely generated as a K-module. It follows that, for any ﬁnitely presented (left
or right) R-module M , M ∗ is also ﬁnitely presented and the canonical map ηM : M → M ∗∗ is an
isomorphism of R-modules. Therefore, as is well known, there is an equivalence

with inverse

(−)∗ : (R-mod)op → R-mod

(−)∗ : R-mod → (R-mod)op.

Suppose that A = R-Mod, (R-Mod)op, R-mod, or (R-mod)op where R is an artin algebra. For a
functor F : A → Ab we deﬁne its predual F∗ : Aop → Ab to be the functor given by F∗(M ) =
F (M ∗).

Frequent use will be made of the following result.

Lemma 2.3. For any left R-module M and right R-module N , there is an isomorphism

(M, N ∗) ∼= (N ⊗ M )∗ ∼= (N, M ∗)

which is natural in M and N .

Proof. Both isomorphisms are instances of the hom-tensor adjunction (see, for example, [2, 19.11]).
Alternatively, one can show that (M, N ∗) ∼= (N, M ∗) directly, which gives an adjunction Φ ⊣ Ψ
where the functors Φ : R-Mod → (Mod-R)op and Ψ : (Mod-R)op → R-Mod are given by
dualisation (the unit of adjunction at M ∈ R-Mod is the canonical map M → M ∗∗).

Remark 2.4 (A note for those who know about monads). The adjunction Φ ⊣ Ψ referred to in
the proof of Lemma 2.3 can be shown to be weakly monadic or “weakly tripleable”(see [14, V.7
Exercises] and combine with [2, 18.1(d), 18.14(d)]). Thus double-dualisation gives a monad on
R-Mod whose category of algebras is (Mod-R)op. This mitigates the absence of an equivalence
R-Mod ≃ (Mod-R)op, since dualisation gives a monadic functor (−)∗ : (Mod-R)op → R-Mod.

2.2 The annihilator functor of a pp pair

Let R be an artin algebra.

For a pp formula θ(x1, . . . , xn) in the language of left R-modules, we will write Fθ : R-Mod →
Ab for the corresponding functor, and Fθ = Fθ|R-mod. We also deﬁne the functor Aθ : (R-Mod)op →
Ab at a left R-module M by

Aθ(M ) = {f ∈ (M ∗)n : f · a = 0 for all a ∈ θ(M )},

1In order to deﬁne the K-module structure on F a for an object a ∈ A, consider that each element k ∈ K gives an

endomorphism k1a : a → a, and hence a homomorphism F (k1a) : F a → F a.

3

i=1 fi(ai). Furthermore, we deﬁne Aθ to be the restriction of Aθ to (R-mod)op.
For a pp pair ϕ/ψ in the language of left R-modules, we will write F

where for f = (f1, . . . , fn) ∈ (M ∗)n and a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ M n we write f · a to denote the sum
Pn
ϕ/ψ = Fϕ/Fψ : R-Mod →
Ab for the corresponding functor, and Fϕ/ψ = F
ϕ/ψ|R-mod. Note that Aϕ is a subfunctor of Aψ, and
ϕ/ψ to (R-mod)op.
so we may deﬁne A
See Section 4.5 for the relationship between these annihilator functors and Prest’s notion of duality
for pp pairs.

ϕ/ψ = Aψ/Aϕ. We also deﬁne Aϕ/ψ to be the restriction of A

It is known that a full subcategory D of R-Mod is deﬁnable iff there is some set T of pp pairs in

the language of left R-modules such that

M ∈ D ⇔ ∀ϕ/ψ ∈ T, A

ϕ/ψM = 0

for all M ∈ R-Mod. In particular this is due to the fact that, for any pp pair ϕ/ψ and any left
R-module M , A
ϕ/ψM = 0 (see [15, 1.3.15]). This motivates the desire to ﬁnd
algebraic characterisations of annihilator functors.

ϕ/ψM = 0 iff F

3 Contravariant functors

3.1 Introducing the main theorems

Now we have enough deﬁnitions to state the two main theorems. In this section R will denote an
artin K-algebra.
Theorem 3.1. Let G : (R-Mod)op → Ab be an additive contravariant functor. The following are
equivalent:

(a) G ∼= F ∗ for some functor F : R-Mod → Ab which preserves direct limits and is ﬁnitely

presented when restricted to R-mod.

(b) G preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.
(c) There are ﬁnitely presented left R-modules A and B and a sequence of natural transformations

(−, A)

/ (−, B)

/ G

/ 0

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module.

(d) There is a sequence of natural transformations

G′

/ G′′

/ G

/ 0

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module, where the functors G′, G′′ : (R-Mod)op →
Ab preserve inverse limits and are ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.

(e) G ∼= F∗ for some functor F : Mod-R → Ab which preserves direct limits and is ﬁnitely

presented when restricted to mod-R.

(f) G ∼= A

ϕ/ψ for some pp pair ϕ/ψ in the language of left R-modules.
Theorem 3.2. For any pp pair ϕ/ψ in the language of left R-modules, F∗

ϕ/ψ

∼= A

ϕ/ψ.

In Section 4, we give a proof of these theorems by showing that (a) ⇔ (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (d) ⇒ (b)

and (c) ⇔ (e) ⇔ (f). We then use (f) ⇒ (b) to prove Theorem 3.2.

The “existence” statement in Theorem 3.1(a) can be strengthened to an “existence and unique-

ness” statement by the following result.
Proposition 3.3. Suppose F1 : R-Mod → Ab is an additive functor which preserves direct limits
and restricts to a ﬁnitely presented functor on R-mod. If an additive functor F2 : R-Mod → Ab is
ﬁnitely presented when restricted to R-mod then
∼= F ∗

2 ⇒ F1 ∼= F2.

F ∗
1

Proof. This proof relies on some facts from Section 3.2 and Section 4.3, so the reader may wish to
1 : (R-Mod)op → Ab preserves inverse limits, so again
return to it later. Now, by Remark 4.10, F ∗
by Remark 4.10, F2 preserves direct limits. By Corollary 4.16, F1|R-mod ∼= F1|∗∗
∼=
F2|R-mod, and so, by Remark 3.4, F1 ∼= F2.

∼= F2|∗∗

3.2 Applications to Ziegler spectra and deﬁnable categories

Remark 3.4. Every additive functor F : R-mod → Ab can be extended to a unique direct limit
−→
preserving functor R-Mod → Ab, which we denote by
F . (See either [7, Section 1] for the case in
−→
which F is ﬁnitely presented, or show that the formula
F M = (−, M ) ⊗R-mod F determines such
a functor.)

Throughout this section, suppose R is an artin algebra. As stated in the introduction, a subcate-
gory of R-Mod is deﬁnable if it is the kernel of a family of functors R-Mod → Ab, each of which
is given by a pp pair. Equivalently (by Theorem 1.1 and Remark 3.4), a deﬁnable subcategory is of
the form

S−1(0)

def
= {M :

−→
F M = 0 for all F ∈ S}

where S is a set of ﬁnitely presented functors R-mod → Ab.

−→
F M )∗ = 0 iff

Let D be a deﬁnable subcategory of R-Mod and take a set S of ﬁnitely presented functors
−→
R-mod → Ab such that D = S−1(0). Then, for each F ∈ S and each left R-module M ,
F ∗(M ) =
−→
F M = 0 iff M ∈ D. Therefore, we have obtained D as the kernel of
0 iff (
a set of contravariant functors (R-Mod)op → Ab, each of which satisﬁes one of the equivalent
conditions listed in Theorem 3.1. (Of course, the kernel of a family of functors (R-Mod)op → Ab is,
strictly speaking, a subcategory of (R-Mod)op, but here we refer to the corresponding subcategory
of R-Mod.) Conversely, let G : (R-Mod)op → Ab be a functor satisfying any of the equivalent
conditions in Theorem 3.1. Then G ∼= F ∗ for some functor F which satisﬁes any of the equivalent
conditions in Theorem 1.1. For any left R-module M , GM = 0 iff F M = 0. Therefore the kernel
of G is deﬁnable. The family of deﬁnable subcategories of R-Mod is closed under intersection, so
the kernel of any family of such functors (R-Mod)op → Ab is deﬁnable.

The Ziegler spectrum of R is a topological space ZgR whose set of points contains one element
of each isomorphism class of the set of all indecomposable pure-injective left R-modules. The
points of ZgR form a set (as opposed to a proper class, see [15, 4.3.38]). The closed sets of ZgR
are those of the form D ∩ ZgR for a deﬁnable subcategory D ⊆ R-Mod. A deﬁnable subcategory
D can be recovered from the set D ∩ ZgR (see [15, 5.1.4]). Theorem 3.1 therefore gives a new
way of characterising the closed sets of ZgR when R is an artin algebra: They are precisely those
←−
of the form {N ∈ ZgR :
G N = 0 for all G ∈ T } where T is a set of ﬁnitely presented functors
(R-mod)op → Ab (see Section 4.4 for an explanation of the notation

←−
G).

Example 3.5. The most basic example is that of a hom-functor (−, A) : (R-Mod)op → Ab for
A ∈ R-mod. Of course it satisﬁes the equivalent conditions in Theorem 3.1, and so has a deﬁnable
kernel, but this is also seen by using the hom-tensor duality (see Lemma 2.3) to obtain the natural
isomorphisms

(−, A) ∼= (−, A∗∗) ∼= (A∗ ⊗ −)∗,

so (−, A) has a deﬁnable kernel because A∗ ⊗ − does (it satisﬁes one of the equivalent conditions
in Theorem 1.1 by [6, 6.1]).

Example 3.6. In this example it is shown that for any ﬁnitely presented left R-module A, Extn(−, A) :
(R-Mod)op → Ab satisﬁes the equivalent conditions in Theorem 3.1 for all n > 0.

There is an exact sequence

/ P

/ A∗

/ 0

where P is a ﬁnitely generated projective right R-module and L ∈ mod-R. Therefore there is an
exact sequence

Note that P ∗ is injective in R-Mod since (−, P ∗) ∼= (P, (−)∗) : (R-Mod)op → Ab is exact because

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module.

Therefore, Ext1(−, A) : (R-Mod)op → Ab satisﬁes condition (c) in Theorem 3.1. Also, for any

n > 0, Extn+1(−, A) ∼= Extn(−, L∗).

Since L∗ is also a ﬁnitely presented left R-module, it follows by induction that for any n > 0,

Extn(−, A) : (R-Mod)op → Ab satisﬁes condition (c) in Theorem 3.1.

Example 3.7. For any morphism (f : A → B) ∈ R-mod, let Gf : (R-Mod)op → Ab be the
functor deﬁned by the exactness of the sequence

(−,f )

(−, A)

/ (−, B)

/ Gf

/ 0

when evaluated at any left R-module. For any left R-module M , Gf M = 0 iff M is projective over
f .

Since Gf satisﬁes one of the equivalent conditions listed in Theorem 3.1, its kernel, gives a

deﬁnable subcategory of R-Mod.

Furthermore, the subcategory D of R-Mod which consists of the left R-modules which are
projective over every epimorphism in R-mod is a deﬁnable subcategory of R-Mod, since D =
{M ∈ R-Mod : Gf M = 0 for all f ∈ R-mod}. However, this is not a new deﬁnable subcategory:
It is the category of ﬂat left R-modules, which is known to be deﬁnable because R is right coherent
(see [15, 3.4.24]). To see that D is the category of ﬂat modules, note that it contains all ﬂat modules
since it contains all projective modules and is closed under direct limits. By Lemma 2.3, for any left
R-module M ∈ D, (M, −) : R-mod → Ab is exact, which implies that (− ⊗ M )∗ ∼= (M, (−)∗) :
(R-mod)op → Ab is exact and therefore − ⊗ M : R-mod → Ab is exact, which is to say that M is
ﬂat.

3.3 Extending faithfulness

This section begins with some lemmas. For the deﬁnition of “locally ﬁnitely presented”, see Section
4.1.

Lemma 3.8. Let C be a locally ﬁnitely presented additive category. Then the following hold.

(a) If α : F → F ′ is a natural transformation between additive functors F, F ′ : C → Ab which
preserve direct limits such that for all c ∈ Cfp the morphism αc : F c → F ′c has the property of
being either a mono-, epi-, or isomorphism then for any d ∈ C the morphism αd : F d → F ′d
has that property too.

(b) If β : G → G′ is a natural transformation between additive functors G, G′ : Cop → Ab which
preserve inverse limits such that for all c ∈ Cfp the morphism βc : Gc → G′c has the property
of being either a mono- or isomorphism then for any d ∈ C the morphism αd : F d → F ′d
has that property too.

Proof. This follows directly from the fact that every object of C is a direct limit of ﬁnitely presented
objects and the fact that direct limits are exact and inverse limits are left exact (the same would hold
if Ab was replaced by any abelian category with exact direct limits).

Lemma 3.9. Let F : C → D be an additive functor from a locally ﬁnitely presented additive
category C to an additive category D which has direct limits, and suppose F preserves direct limits
and sends ﬁnitely presented objects to ﬁnitely presented objects. If F |Cfp : Cfp → D is (fully) faithful
then F : C → D is (fully) faithful.

Proof. Consider, for objects a, b ∈ C, the homomorphism

Fab : C(a, b) → D(F a, F b) : f 7→ F f.

It is natural in a and b, and when a is ﬁnitely presented, the functors C(a, −), D(F a, F −) : C →
Ab preserve direct limits. Therefore, since, when a and b are ﬁnitely presented the map Fab is a
monomorphism, it follows that Fab is a monomorphism if a is ﬁnitely presented by Lemma 3.8.

We have just shown that, for any object b ∈ C, the morphism Fab is a monomorphism when
a is ﬁnitely presented. The functors C(−, b), D(F −, F b) : Cop → Ab preserve inverse limits. It
follows that Fab is a monomorphism for any objects a, b ∈ C by Lemma 3.8.

One can replace “monomorphism” by “isomorphism” throughout the proof.

Corollary 3.10. Let R be an artin algebra and let F : R-Mod → Ab be a functor which preserves
direct limits, and assume that F |R-mod : R-mod → Ab is ﬁnitely presented. If F |R-mod : R-mod →
Ab is (fully) faithful then F : R-Mod → Ab is (fully) faithful.

Proof. Consider the corresponding functor F : R-Mod → K-Mod. By Lemma 3.9, we need
only show that it sends ﬁnitely presented objects to ﬁnitely presented objects. Indeed, we have an
exact sequence (A, −) → (B, −) → F |R-mod → 0, where A and B are ﬁnitely presented. Now,
since R is an artin algebra over K, i.e.
is ﬁnitely generated as a K-module, both A and B are
ﬁnitely presented as K-modules. Also, since K is artinian, and hence noetherian, for any ﬁnitely
presented R-module C, both (A, C) and (B, C) are ﬁnitely presented K-modules. Therefore, since
the sequence (A, C) → (B, C) → F C → 0 is exact, F C is a ﬁnitely presented K-module.

Remark 3.11. Corollary 3.10 holds in the more general case that R is a K-algebra which is ﬁnitely
generated as a K-module and K is any noetherian ring.

Corollary 3.12. Let R be an artin algebra and let G : (R-Mod)op → Ab be a functor which
preserves inverse limits, and assume that G|(R-mod)op : (R-mod)op → Ab is ﬁnitely presented. If
G|(R-mod)op : (R-mod)op → Ab is faithful then G : (R-Mod)op → Ab is faithful.

Proof. By Theorem 3.1, we have G ∼= F ∗ where F : R-Mod → Ab preserves direct limits and
F |R-mod is ﬁnitely presented. By Corollary 4.16, F |R-mod ∼= (G|(R-mod)op)∗, so for any morphism
(f : A → B) ∈ R-mod, F f = 0 ⇒ (Gf )∗ = 0 ⇒ Gf = 0 ⇒ f = 0. Therefore, F |R-mod is
faithful, and so, by Corollary 3.10, F is faithful.

Let any morphism (f : A → B) ∈ R-Mod be given. Then, since F is faithful, Gf = 0 ⇒

(F f )∗ = 0 ⇒ F f = 0 ⇒ f = 0. Therefore G is faithful.

Corollary 3.13. Let R be an artin algebra. For a ﬁnitely presented left R-module N , if N is a
cogenerator for R-mod then N is also a cogenerator for R-Mod.

Proof. Let G = (−, N ) : (R-Mod)op → Ab. Since N is ﬁnitely presented, G|(R-mod)op is
ﬁnitely presented. The statement that N is a cogenerator for R-mod is precisely the statement
that G|(R-mod)op is faithful, and the statement that N is a cogenerator for R-Mod is precisely the
statement that G is faithful. If G is faithful then G|(R-mod)op is clearly faithful, and the converse
holds by Corollary 3.12 because G|(R-mod)op is ﬁnitely presented.

3.4 Example: The contravariant projectively stable hom-functor

As an example, it is shown that, given the Auslander-Reiten formula for ﬁnitely presented modules
(i.e.
the way it is presented at [8, IV.2.13]), one can show that it holds when one variable is not
necessarily ﬁnitely presented (i.e. as given in [12]). Let R be an artin algebra throughout this
section.

For a left R-module M , let M t = HomR(M, R), which is a right R-module with (f r)(x) =
f (x)r for all f ∈ M t, x ∈ M and r ∈ R. For each N ∈ R-Mod, we have a functor (−)t ⊗ N :
(R-Mod)op → Ab.

Proposition 3.14. If N is a ﬁnitely presented left R-module, then the functor (−)t⊗N : (R-Mod)op →
Ab preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.

Proof. Find positive integers m and n and a right exact sequence Rm → Rn → N → 0. Then we
have a sequence of natural transformations (−)t ⊗ Rm → (−)t ⊗ Rn → (−)t ⊗ N → 0 which
is exact when evaluated at any left R-module. Therefore, by Theorem 3.1, we need only prove that
(−)t ⊗ R satisﬁes these criteria, and indeed it does since (−)t ⊗ R ∼= (−, R).

Deﬁnition 3.15. For left R-modules M and N , write HomR(M, N ) = (M, N )/P (M, N ), where
P (M, N ) denotes the group of maps M → N which factor through a projective left R-module.

Remark 3.16. Note that if a morphism M → N in R-Mod factors through a projective left R-
module then it factors through any epimorphism P → N where P is a projective, and thus if N is
ﬁnitely presented it factors through a ﬁnitely presented projective left R-module.

Theorem 3.17. For any ﬁnitely presented left R-module N , the functor HomR(−, N ) : (R-Mod)op →
Ab preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.

Proof. By the same proof as that of [8, IV.2.12], there is a sequence of natural transformations

(−)t ⊗ N

/ (−, N )

/ HomR(−, N )

/ 0

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module. By Theorem 3.1, this ﬁnishes the proof.

Corollary 3.18 (See [12] for an alternative proof.). Let N be a ﬁnitely presented left R-module. For
any left R-module M there is an isomorphism

Ext1(N, M )∗ ∼= HomR(M, τ N )

which is natural in M , where τ is the Auslander-Reiten translation.

Proof. This proof relies on a fact from Section 4, so the reader may wish to return to it later. By
the Auslander-Reiten formula [8, IV.2.13], there is such a natural isomorphism for M ∈ R-mod.
However, both Ext1(N, −)∗ and HomR(−, τ N ) preserve inverse limits (by [4, Corollary of The-
orem 1] and Theorem 3.17), so by Theorem 4.20 they are, up to isomorphism, the same functor
(R-Mod)op → Ab.

4 Background and proof of the main theorems

The main results are proven by a number of steps which require some background knowledge. We
will go through the background in this section, and slowly prove the theorems. Throughout, let R
denote an artin algebra.

4.1 Finitely presented objects

This section is just background on ﬁnitely presented objects and ﬁnitely presented functors. Knowl-
edge of the results in this section is assumed throughout the rest of this paper.

An object c ∈ C in a pre-additive category C is said to be ﬁnitely presented if C(c, −) : C →

Ab preserves direct limits.

We say that an additive category C is locally ﬁnitely presented if Cfp (the subcategory of ﬁnitely
presented objects) is skeletally small and every object of C is the direct limit of a direct system of
ﬁnitely presented objects. (Note that we do not insist that C is complete or cocomplete, so this is
different to the notion of “locally ﬁnitely presented” in [1].)

For any small pre-additive category A, we write A-Mod for the category of all additive functors
A → Ab, and we deﬁne A-mod = (A-Mod)fp. We write Mod-A = Aop-Mod and mod-A =
Aop-mod.

Theorem 4.1. [10, Section 1.2] Suppose A is a small additive category. Then A-Mod is locally
ﬁnitely presented, and A-mod consists of those functors F which appear in an exact sequence of the
form A(a, −) → A(b, −) → F → 0 for some a, b ∈ A.

j=1 A(bj , −) → F → 0 for positive integers m and n and objects a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn ∈ A.

Corollary 4.2. If A is any small pre-additive category then A-Mod is locally ﬁnitely presented, and
A-mod consists of those functors F which appear in an exact sequence of the form Lm
i=1 A(ai, −) →
Ln
Proof. One can construct a small additive category A+ which is freely generated by A: its objects
are ﬁnite strings of objects from A and its morphisms are matrices consisting of morphisms of A.
The inclusion functor A → A+ induces an equivalence A+-Mod → A-Mod. Therefore A-Mod is
locally ﬁnitely presented and the ﬁnitely presented objects can therefore be found by applying this
equivalence to those in A+-Mod, hence the stated characterisation.

Corollary 4.3. If A is a ring then A-Mod is locally ﬁnitely presented, and A-mod consists of those
modules M which appear in an exact sequence of the form Am → An → M → 0 where m and n
are positive integers.

Theorem 4.4. [6, 2.1] Let A be an abelian category and let P be a full additive subcategory of A
consisting only of projective objects. Let P ′ be the full subcategory of A consisting of all objects
a ∈ A for which there is an exact sequence p → q → a → 0 with p, q ∈ P . Then the following hold.

(a) P ′ is closed under extensions.
(b) P ′ is closed under cokernels.
(c) If P has the additional property that, for any morphism (q → r) ∈ P there is an exact

sequence (p → q → r) ∈ A with p ∈ P , then P ′ is closed under kernels.

Deﬁnition 4.5. Let A be a pre-additive category. A weak cokernel of a morphism (f : a → b) ∈ A
is a morphism (g : b → c) ∈ A such that, for every object x ∈ A the sequence

A(c, x)

A(g,x)

/ A(b, x)

A(f,x)

/ A(a, x)

is exact. If every morphism in A has a weak cokernel then we say that A has weak cokernels or is
with weak cokernels.

Corollary 4.6. For any small additive category A with weak cokernels, A-mod is an abelian sub-
category of A-Mod.

Corollary 4.7. For any small pre-additive category A, (A-mod)-mod is an abelian subcategory of
(A-mod)-Mod.

Corollary 4.8. For any left noetherian ring R, R-mod is an abelian subcategory of R-Mod, and
hence mod-(R-mod) is an abelian subcategory of Mod-(R-mod).

Remark 4.9. In particular, Corollary 4.8 applies to artin algebras, since all artin algebras are artinian
rings and are therefore noetherian.

4.2 Dualising a covariant representable functor
Remark 4.10. The functor (−)∗ : (K-Mod)op → K-Mod preserves and reﬂects inverse limits.
This can be seen either by proving it directly or by the fact that it is monadic (see Remark 2.4).
In particular, this implies that a functor F : R-Mod → Ab preserves direct limits iff its dual
F ∗ : (R-Mod)op → Ab preserves inverse limits. Note that this proves the (a) implies (b) part of
Theorem 3.1.
Lemma 4.11. (Similar to [16, 3.2.6].) Let M and N be a left R-modules. There is a linear isomor-
phism

σMN : M ∗ ⊗ N → (N, M )∗

such that σMN (f ⊗ n)(g) = f (g(n)) for all f ∈ M ∗ and n ∈ N , which is natural in M and N .
Also, σMN is an isomorphism when N is ﬁnitely presented.
Corollary 4.12. For any ﬁnitely presented left R-module N , (N, −)∗ ∼= (−)∗ ⊗ N as functors
(R-Mod)op → Ab.
Corollary 4.13. If a left R-module N is ﬁnitely presented then the functor (−)∗⊗N : (R-Mod)op →
Ab preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.

Proof. Since (−)∗ ⊗ N ∼= (N, −)∗, it follows from Remark 4.10 that it preserves inverse limits.
Therefore we need only show that it is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to (R-mod)op.

Choose a right exact sequence Rm → Rn → N → 0 where n and m are positive integers. Since
mod-(R-mod) is closed under cokernels (see [10, Section 2.2]), and by the fact that there is a right
exact sequence (−)∗ ⊗ Rm → (−)∗ ⊗ Rn → (−)∗ ⊗ N → 0, we need only show that (−)∗ ⊗ R
is ﬁnitely presented. Indeed, for each M ∈ R-Mod, we have isomorphisms M ∗ ⊗ R ∼= M ∗ ∼=
(R, M ∗) ∼= (M, R∗) which are natural in M by Lemma 2.3, so (−)∗ ⊗ R ∼= (−, R∗), which is
ﬁnitely presented since R∗ is a ﬁnitely presented left R-module.

4.3 Duality of ﬁnitely presented functors
We have the usual duality of ﬁnitely presented modules (−)∗ : R-mod ≃ (mod-R)op. This section
looks at how it interacts with two other dualities.

For any functor F : R-mod → Ab, we deﬁne dF : mod-R → Ab to be the functor given by

(dF )M = (F, M ⊗ −)

for every M ∈ R-mod. Thus we have a functor d : ((R-mod)-Mod)op → (mod-R)-Mod.
In particular, if F : R-mod → Ab is ﬁnitely presented, then
This is discussed in [15, 10.3].
so is dF . Furthermore, there is, for any F : R-mod → Ab, a canonical natural transformation
F → d2F which is an isomorphism when F is ﬁnitely presented. From this comes an equivalence
(R-mod)-mod ≃ ((mod-R)-mod)op.
Proposition 4.14. If F : R-mod → Ab is ﬁnitely presented then its dual F ∗ : (R-mod)op → Ab is
also ﬁnitely presented.

Proof. Find a morphism f : A → B, with A and B ﬁnitely presented, such that F is the cokernel
of the induced map (f, −) : (B, −) → (A, −). Then F ∗ is the kernel of the induced map (f, −)∗ :
(A, −)∗ → (B, −)∗. But, by Lemma 4.11 and Corollary 4.13, (B, −)∗ and (A, −)∗ are ﬁnitely
presented, and so, since (R-mod)-mod is closed under kernels (by Corollary 4.7), F ∗ is ﬁnitely
presented.

Proposition 4.15. If G : (R-mod)op → Ab is ﬁnitely presented then its dual G∗ : R-mod → Ab is
also ﬁnitely presented.

Proof. Find a morphism f : A → B, with A and B ﬁnitely presented, such that G is the cokernel
of the induced map (−, f ) : (−, A) → (−, B). Then G∗ is the kernel of the induced map (−, f )∗ :
(−, B)∗ → (−, A)∗. But, by Lemma 4.11, (−, B)∗ ∼= B ∗ ⊗ − and (−, A)∗ ∼= A∗ ⊗ − are ﬁnitely
presented, and so, since mod-(R-mod) is closed under kernels (by Corollary 4.8), G∗ is ﬁnitely
presented.

10

Corollary 4.16. For any ﬁnitely presented functor F : R-mod → Ab, the canonical natural trans-
formation F → F ∗∗ is an isomorphism.

For any ﬁnitely presented G : (R-mod)op → Ab, the canonical natural transformation G → G∗∗

is an isomorphism.

Therefore, there is an equivalence of categories (−)∗ : ((R-mod)-mod)op → mod-(R-mod) with

pseudo-inverse (−)∗ : mod-(R-mod) → ((R-mod)-mod)op.

Proof. Since F is ﬁnitely presented, for any ﬁnitely generated left R-module M , F M is a ﬁnitely
generated K-module, and hence F M → (F M )∗∗ is an isomorphism. The proof for G is similar.

Remark 4.17. The proof that the operation d gives a duality of ﬁnitely presented functors (see [15,
10.3] for a proof) relies on the fact that the injectives in (R-mod)-mod are precisely the functors of
the form M ⊗ − for a ﬁnitely presented right R-module M . This is true for any ring R, but it is
easier to prove if R is an artin algebra since we can use Lemma 4.11 and Corollary 4.16.

For any functor F ∈ (R-mod)-Mod, deﬁne F ∧ : (R-mod)op → Ab by F ∧M = (dF )(M ∗).

Proposition 4.18. For any ﬁnitely presented functor F : R-mod → Ab, there is an isomorphism
F ∗ ∼= F ∧.

Proof. Find a morphism f : A → B, with A and B ﬁnitely presented, such that F is the cokernel
of the induced map (f, −) : (B, −) → (A, −). Then F ∗ is the kernel of the induced map (f, −)∗ :
(A, −)∗ → (B, −)∗ and F ∧ is the kernel of the induced map (f, −)∧ : (A, −)∧ → (B, −)∧.

But there is an isomorphism

(M, −)∧ ∼= (−)∗ ⊗ M ∼= (M, −)∗

which holds for every M ∈ R-mod, and naturally so (to see this, note that, by the Yoneda lemma,
d(M, −) ∼= − ⊗ M , and then apply Lemma 4.11). Therefore, F ∗ and F ∧ are kernels of (up to
isomorphism) the same map.

A better alternative proof can be given as follows. Note that, for any functors F : R-mod → Ab
and G : (R-mod)op → Ab, there is an isomorphism (F, G∗) ∼= (G ⊗R-mod F )∗ ∼= (G, F ∗) which is
natural in F and G. (This follows from an easy generalisation of Lemma 2.3.) It follows from this
and Lemma 4.11 that there are isomorphisms

F ∧M = (dF )(M ∗) = (F, M ∗ ⊗ −) ∼= (F, (−, M )∗) ∼= ((−, M ), F ∗) ∼= F ∗M

which are natural in F and M . This proof has the advantage of making it obvious that the isomor-
phism is natural in F and also making it clear that we don’t in fact need the assumption that F is
ﬁnitely presented.

4.4 Extending contravariant functors along direct limits
Any functor R-mod → Ab can be uniquely extended to a direct limit preserving functor R-Mod →
Ab (see Remark 3.4). Here we give a contravariant analogue of this result.

For any functor G : (R-mod)op → Ab, write

←−
G : (R-Mod)op → Ab for the functor given by

←−
G M = ((−, M ), G)

at any left R-module M (the representable (−, M ) is to be read as a functor on (R-mod)op). Also,
←−
for any natural transformation α : G → G′ in mod-(R-mod), write ←−α :
G′ for the induced
natural transformation. By the Yoneda lemma, there is, for any G ∈ Mod-(R-mod), an isomorphism
←−
G |(R-mod)op ∼= G which is natural in G.
Lemma 4.19. For any functor G : (R-Mod)op → Ab which preserves inverse limits, and any left
R-module M , there is an isomorphism

←−
G →

which is natural in G and M .

GM ∼=

←−−−−−−−
G|(R-mod)opM

11

Proof. There is a homomorphism

θM : GM → ((−, M ), G|(R-mod)op)

deﬁned by sending an element x ∈ GM to the natural transformation αx : (−, M ) → G|(R-mod)op
which, at any L ∈ R-mod, has the component

αxL : (L, M ) → GL : f 7→ G(f )(x).

The map θM is natural in M , and, by the Yoneda lemma, it is an isomorphism when M is ﬁnitely pre-
←−−−−−−−
sented. Therefore, we have a natural transformation θ : G →
G|(R-mod)op which is an isomorphism
when evaluated at ﬁnitely presented left R-modules. However, every left R-module can be written
as a direct limit (i.e. an inverse limit in (R-Mod)op) of ﬁnitely presented left R-modules. Since both
G and

←−−−−−−−
G|(R-mod)op preserve inverse limits, it follows from Lemma 3.8 that θ is an isomorphism.

Theorem 4.20. Let G : (R-mod)op → Ab be any additive functor. Then
of G to an additive functor (R-Mod)op → Ab which preserves inverse limits.

←−
G is the unique extension

Proof. The Yoneda embedding Y : R-Mod → ((R-mod)op, Ab) preserves direct limits. Therefore,
the induced embedding Y op : (R-Mod)op → ((R-mod)op, Ab)op preserves inverse limits. All
representable functors preserve inverse limits. Therefore, since

←−
G is the composition

(R-Mod)op

Y op

/ ((R-mod)op, Ab)op (−,G)

/ Ab,

it does preserve inverse limits and, by the Yoneda lemma, it does restrict to G on (R-mod)op. We
need only prove the uniqueness.

Let G′ : (R-Mod)op → Ab be any other such functor. Since G′|(R-mod)op ∼= G, by Lemma 4.19,

we have G′ ∼=

←−−−−−−−
G′|(R-mod)op ∼=

←−
G.

Proposition 4.21. Suppose that G : (R-Mod)op → Ab preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely pre-
sented when restricted to (R-mod)op. Then G ∼= F ∗ for some functor F : R-Mod → Ab which
preserves direct limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to R-mod.

Proof. Let F =
where G0 = G|(R-mod)op. Then F ∗ preserves inverse limits, and F ∗|R-mod = (F |R-mod)∗ ∼= G∗∗

0 to a functor R-Mod → Ab which preserves direct limits,
∼=

0, the extension of G∗

Remark 4.22. Proposition 4.21 shows that (b) implies (a) in Theorem 3.1.

Lemma 4.23. For any ﬁnitely presented left R-module A, and any ﬁnitely presented right R-module
N , there is an isomorphism (N ∗, A) ∼= (A∗, N ) which is natural in both N and A.

Proof. By repeated use of Lemma 2.3 and the natural isomorphisms A ∼= A∗∗ and N ∼= N ∗∗ (which
are natural in A and N respectively),

(N ∗, A) ∼= (N ∗, A∗∗) ∼= (A∗, N ∗∗) ∼= (A∗, N )

which are natural in both A and N .

Alternatively, one can use the fact that, for any functor F : C → D, the maps C(c, c′) →
D(F c, F c′) are natural in both variables. Therefore, by applying this to the equivalence (−)∗ :
(R-mod)op → mod-R and using the isomorphism N ∼= N ∗∗ (natural in N ) we obtain isomorphisms

(N ∗, A) ∼= (A∗, N ∗∗) ∼= (A∗, N )

which are natural in both A and N .

Lemma 4.24. For any ﬁnitely presented functor G : (R-mod)op → Ab, its predual G∗ is ﬁnitely
presented.

Proof. Find (f : A → B) ∈ R-mod and a right exact sequence

/ G(N ∗)

/ 0

(A∗, N )

(f ∗,N )

/ (B ∗, N )

in which the vertical arrows are isomorphisms, both natural in N . Therefore G∗ is the cokernel
of a morphism ((A∗, −) → (B ∗, −)) ∈ (mod-R, Ab), and so since both A∗ and B ∗ are ﬁnitely
presented, G∗ is ﬁnitely presented.

Proposition 4.25. For any ﬁnitely presented functor G : (R-mod)op → Ab and any left R-module
M , there is an isomorphism

←−
G M ∼= (G∗, − ⊗ M )∗.

which is natural in both G and M .

Proof. Consider the functor F : R-Mod → Ab, deﬁned by F M = (G∗, − ⊗ M ) for all M ∈
R-Mod. Then F is the composition

R-Mod

T /

/ (mod-R)-Mod (G∗,−)

/ Ab

where T maps M ∈ R-Mod to − ⊗ M ∈ (mod-R)-Mod. Both T and (G∗, −) preserves direct
limits, and therefore F preserves direct limits. Note that F |R-mod = d(G∗).

Now let G′ = F ∗. By the proof of Theorem 4.20, there is an isomorphism

←−−−−−−−
G′|(R-mod)op ∼=
G′ which is natural in G′, and hence in G. We need only show that there is an isomorphism
G′|(R-mod)op ∼= G which is also natural in G. Indeed, by Proposition 4.18, we have the isomor-
phisms

G′|(R-mod)op = (d(G∗))∗ ∼= (d(G∗))∧ ∼= (d(d(G∗)))∗ ∼= G∗∗ ∼= G,

each of which is natural in G.

But then, since dualising preserves exactness, the sequence

is exact. However, this sequence is isomorphic to

Lemma 4.27. For all left R-modules M and N , there is an isomorphism
which is natural in M and N .

(−, N )(M ) ∼= (M, N )

Proof. By Lemma 3.9 and the Yoneda embedding, the functor

←−−−−
(−, N )(M ) = ((−, M ), (−, N )) ∼= (M, N )

which is natural in M and N .

Remark 4.28. We now show how to prove that (b) implies (c) in Theorem 3.1. Let G : (R-Mod)op →
Ab be given, and assume that G0 = G|(R-mod)op is ﬁnitely presented. Then there is a morphism
(f : A → B) ∈ R-mod and a right exact sequence

(−,f )

(R-Mod)op, giving
Clearly (c) implies (d).
Remark 4.29. To prove that (d) implies (b) in Theorem 3.1, note that mod-(R-mod) is closed under
cokernels, so certainly G|(R-mod)op is ﬁnitely presented. From Corollary 4.26, we see that G is the
extension of some ﬁnitely presented functor (R-mod)op → Ab to a functor which preserves limits.
Remark 4.30. To prove that (c) implies (e) in Theorem 3.1, take a sequence

(−,f )

(−, A)

/ (−, B)

/ G

/ 0,

as described in (c). By the duality between ﬁnitely presented R-modules, there is an exact sequence

(−, A∗∗)

(−,f ∗∗)

/ (−, B ∗∗)

/ G

/ 0.

However, by Lemma 2.3, this gives an exact sequence

(A∗, (−)∗)

/ (B ∗, (−)∗)

(f ∗,(−)∗)

/ G

/ 0.

However, this shows that G ∼= F∗, where F is the cokernel of the natural transformation (f ∗, −) :
(A∗, −) → (B ∗, −) , thus establishing (e).

These steps are essentially reversible, so (e) implies (c) in Theorem 3.1.

4.5 Annihilator functors and duality of pp pairs

So far, the dualities we have considered have been purely algebraic. However, there is a duality be-
tween pp formulas which corresponds to the equivalence d : ((R-mod)-mod)op → (mod-R)-mod.

There is a similar map sending pp formulas in the language of left R-modules to pp formulas in the
language of right R-modules.

The operation ϕ 7→ Dϕ provides a duality on the level of pp pairs, since ψ 6 ϕ implies Dϕ 6
Dψ and D2ϕ = ϕ for all pp formulas ϕ and ψ in the language of left R-modules. In particular, to
each pp pair ϕ/ψ in the language of left R-modules, we have a corresponding pp pair Dψ/Dϕ in the
language of right R-modules. Thus, for a ﬁnitely presented functor Fϕ/ψ : R-mod → Ab given by
a pp pair ϕ/ψ, we have a corresponding functor FDψ/Dϕ : mod-R → Ab. One can show, by using
∼= FDψ/Dϕ.
the short exact sequence resulting from [15, 10.3.6] and the snake lemma, that dFϕ/ψ
The reason we consider this duality is the fact that Aϕ(M ) = FDϕ(M ∗) for any pp formula ϕ

in the language of left R-modules and any left R-module M (see [15, 1.3.12]). Therefore

A

ϕ/ψ = (F

Dψ/Dϕ)∗,

which gives the next result immediately. It also proves that (e) is equivalent to (f) in Theorem 3.1.
We have now proven Theorem 3.1.
Corollary 4.31. For any pp formula ϕ in the language of left R-modules, the functor A
(R-Mod)op → Ab preserves inverse limits.

Let F : R-mod → Ab be a ﬁnitely presented functor. On the surface, it seems like Proposi-
tion 4.18 showed that F ∗ can be expressed as the more complicated functor F ∧. However, a lot of
information is already known about F ∧ in the model theory of modules, so in fact we can now refer
to some results from there to learn about F ∗.

Proof. It follows from (f) in Theorem 3.1 that A

ϕ/ψ agree on (R-mod)op, Theorem 4.20 shows that they agree on (R-Mod)op.

Remark 4.34. One can show directly, without using (f) in Theorem 3.1, that a functor of the form
Aϕ for a pp formula ϕ preserves inverse limits. This gives an alternative proof that the annihilator
functor A
ϕ/ψ of a pp pair ϕ/ψ preserves inverse limits, which goes as follows. We know that there
is a sequence

which is exact when evaluated at any left R-module. It follows from (d) in Theorem 3.1 that A
preserves inverse limits.

5 Generalisation: Dualising locally ﬁnitely presented categories

Here we extend some of our results so that they apply to contravariant functors on more general
categories than just R-Mod for an artin algebra R. Let A denote a small, additive, K-linear cat-
egory. Despite them not being precisely the same thing (though, they are isomorphic), we write
(A, K-mod) for the category of functors A → Ab for which F a is a ﬁnitely generated K-module
for every object a ∈ C, and similarly for (Aop, K-mod). Clearly we have equivalences

(A, K-mod)op → (Aop, K-mod) : F 7→ F ∗
(Aop, K-mod)op → (A, K-mod) : G 7→ G∗.

Deﬁnition 5.1. [3] A small, additive, K-linear category A is called a dualising variety (or dualising
K-variety) if it satisﬁes each of the following:

(a) A is ﬁnite, which means that, for any objects a, b ∈ A, the hom-set A(a, b) is a ﬁnitely

generated K-module.

(b) It is a variety, which means that all idempotents split in A (it is also said that A is Karoubian

or idempotent complete when this is the case).

(c) The equivalence

(−)∗(Aop, K-mod)op → (A, K-mod)

restricts to an equivalence (mod-A)op → A-mod .

(d) The equivalence

(−)∗ : (A, K-mod)op → (Aop, K-mod)

restricts to an equivalence (A-mod)op → mod-A .

Remark 5.2. In order for the deﬁnition of dualising variety to make sense, note that if A is ﬁnite then
A-mod is a subcategory of (A, K-mod) and mod-A is a subcategory of (Aop, K-mod).
Remark 5.3. If A is a dualising variety then so is Aop.

Theorem 5.4. [3, 2.4] A ﬁnite variety A is a dualising variety if and only if it satisﬁes each of the
following conditions.

(a) A and Aop have weak cokernels.

(b) For every object b ∈ A there is an object c ∈ A such that

A(a, b) → HomA(c,c)op(A(c, a), A(c, b))

is an isomorphism for every object x ∈ A.

(c) For every object b ∈ A there is an object d ∈ A such that

A(a, b) → HomA(d,d)(A(b, d), A(a, d))

is an isomorphism for every object a ∈ A.

Corollary 5.5. If A is a dualising variety then A-mod is an abelian subcategory of A-Mod and
mod-A is an abelian subcategory of Mod-A.

Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 5.4 and Corollary 4.6.

Example 5.6. It is clear from Section 4.3 that if R is an artin algebra then R-mod is a dualising
variety.

Example 5.7. It follows from Theorem 5.4 that, for any artin algebra R, R-proj, the category of
ﬁnitely generated projective left R-modules, is a dualising variety (see [3, 2.5]).

Theorem 5.8. [3, 2.6] If A is a dualising variety then so is A-mod.

Now we go on to see how these concepts give a strengthening of the main results.

Deﬁnition 5.9. We say that an additive K-linear category A is a dlfp K-linear category (or just
dlfp category) if A is locally ﬁnitely presented and Afp is a dualising K-variety.

Remark 5.10. Here dlfp is an abbreviation for “dualising locally ﬁnitely presented”.

Corollary 5.11. If A is a dlfp category then so are Afp-Mod and Mod-Afp.

Theorem 5.12. Suppose A is a locally ﬁnitely presented category. Then for every additive functor
←−
G : Afpop → Ab, there is a unique functor
G : Aop → Ab which preserves inverse limits such that
←−
←−
G |Afpop ∼= G. In particular,
G is given by

←−
G a = (A(−, a)|Afpop, G).

Proof. This is a straightforward generalisation of Theorem 4.20.

Remark 5.13. If A is any locally ﬁnitely presented category and F : Afp → Ab is any additive
−→
F : A → Ab unique to the
functor, then the formula
property that it preserves direct limits and restricts to F on Afp.

−→
F a = A(−, a)|Afp ⊗Afp F deﬁnes the functor

Theorem 5.14. Let A be a dlfp category. For any ﬁnitely presented functor G : Afpop → Ab and
any object a ∈ A, there is an isomorphism

←−

G a ∼= (cid:16)−→

G∗a(cid:17)∗

natural in both a and G.

Proof. Let a small K-linear category B and additive functors U : Bop → Ab and V : B → Ab be
given. There is an isomorphism

(U ⊗B V )∗ ∼= (U, V ∗)

which is natural in U and V . Applying this in the case B = Afp, U = A(−, a)|Afp and V = G∗
gives the result since there is an isomorphism G∗∗ ∼= G which is natural in G.

17

Corollary 5.15. If A is a dlfp category, G, G′, G′′ : Afpop → Ab are ﬁnitely presented additive
functors and

is an exact sequence, then the induced sequence

G′ → G′′ → G → 0

←−
G′ →

←−
G′′ →

←−
G → 0

is exact when evaluated at any object in A.

We now have the following generalisation of (some parts of) Theorem 3.1, which follows by a

similar argument.

Theorem 5.16. Let A be a dlfp category and let G : Aop → Ab be any additive functor. The
following are equivalent:

(a) G ∼= F ∗ for some functor F : A → Ab which preserves direct limits and is ﬁnitely presented

when restricted to Afp.

(b) G preserves inverse limits and is ﬁnitely presented when restricted to Afpop.
(c) There are objects a, b ∈ Cfp and a sequence of natural transformations

A(−, a) → A(−, b) → G → 0

which is exact when evaluated at any object.

(d) There is a sequence of natural transformations

G′ → G′′ → G → 0

which is exact when evaluated at any object, where the functors G′, G′′ : A → Ab preserve
inverse limits and are ﬁnitely presented when restricted to Afpop.

Example 5.17. In [10, 1.4], a one-to-one correspondence is established between small additive cate-
gories with split idempotents and locally ﬁnitely presented additive categories. This correspondence
sends a small additive category A with split idempotents to the category Flat-A of all ﬂat objects in
Mod-A, and sends a locally ﬁnitely presented additive category to its category of ﬁnitely presented
objects. The category of ﬁnitely presented objects in Flat-A is the category of all ﬁnitely presented
projectives in Mod-A. Therefore, for any module category, the category of ﬂat modules is locally
ﬁnitely presented, and the ﬁnitely presented projective modules are the ﬁnitely presented objects in
the category of ﬂat objects.

It follows from these facts and Example 5.7 that Flat-R is a dlfp category when R is an artin

algebra.

Remark 5.18. The one-to-one correspondence mentioned in Example 5.17 induces a one-to-one
correspondence between dualising varieties and dlfp categories (in the sense that two K-linear cate-
gories should be considered to be “the same” iff there is a K-linear equivalence between them).
