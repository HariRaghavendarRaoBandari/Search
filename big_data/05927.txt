Abstract. We propose a method to create higher orbital states of ultracold atoms
in the Mott regime of an optical lattice. This is done by periodically modulating the
position of the trap minima (known as shaking) and controlling the interference term
of the lasers creating the lattice. These methods are combined with techniques of
shortcuts to adiabaticity. As an example of this, we show speciﬁcally how to create
an anti–ferromagnetic type ordering of angular momentum states of atoms. The
speciﬁc pulse sequences are designed using Lewis–Riesenfeld invariants and a four–
level model for each well. The results are compared with numerical simulations of the
full Schr¨odinger equation.

Creating exotic angular momentum states by shaking an optical lattice

1. Introduction

Optical lattices have proven to be highly versatile systems for investigating quantum
many body physics [1, 2]. A notable example of this is the observation of the phase
transition between a superﬂuid and a Mott–insulator state [3, 4]. These results are
achieved with atoms trapped in the lowest band of the optical lattice. However, in
the solid state, the orbital degree of freedom also plays an important role in many of
the complex phases. For instance, many models in high temperature superconductivity
involve higher orbital occupations [5, 6, 7]. As a result, there has been a lot of interest
recently in the physics of higher bands of optical lattices [8, 9]. The bosonic Hubbard
model describing the lowest band has been extended to incorporate higher Bloch bands
[10] and Bose-Einstein condensation with nonzero orbital momenta has been studied
[11, 12]. Many exotic phases have been predicted to occur due to the interplay of
interactions and the higher bands [13].

Recently, ﬁrst experiments have been performed realising multiorbital systems with
ultracold atoms [14, 15] where the lifetimes of atoms in the excited state have been long
enough to observe tunnelling dynamics.
In particular, the formation of a superﬂuid
in the higher bands has been experimentally achieved [16]. The condensate formation
in the higher bands has been used to investigate topologically induced avoided band
crossing [17].

Engineering quantum states in higher bands is therefore of large interest and several
techniques have been developed to manipulate the state of atoms in an optical lattice [9].
One example of this is periodic modulation of the lattice amplitudes in order to induce
controlled transitions to higher orbital states [18] or transitions to motional eigenstates
[19]. Higher orbitals have also be generated by stimulated Raman transitions [15].

Another possibility is to shake the lattice in one direction, i.e., a periodic modulation
of the position of the trap minima. The idea of shaking a single trap has been previously
used for a variety of other tasks such as vibrational state inversion of a condensate in
a trap [20] and Ramsey interferometry using the motional states of the condensate
[21]. Shaking of an optical lattice in one direction has been examined theoretically in
connection with quantum computation [22] and especially to create higher orbital states
in the lattice [23, 24, 25]. The latter has also been realised experimentally [26, 27].
Recently there has been work which combines both amplitude and position modulation
of the lattice potential using optimal control in order to transfer atoms between diﬀerent
vibrational states [28].

The goal of this paper is to further develop the idea of shaking an optical lattice
in order to create exotic states. This will be done by combining lattice shaking with
techniques known as “Shortcuts to Adiabaticity” [29]. In general, performing fast and
stable state preparation of quantum systems is very demanding. Adiabatic techniques
are a common choice but have the drawback of needing extremely long times [30]. This
has motivated the development of shortcuts to adiabaticity, which are protocols which
reach ﬁdelities of adiabatic processes in signiﬁcantly shorter times. For a review of these

see [31, 32]. An important advantage of these methods is that they possess a certain
freedom to optimise against noise, systematic error or unwanted transitions to higher
levels [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. In the following, we will show that combining optical lattice
shaking with shortcut techniques can lead to schemes that are experimentally feasible
(only requiring control over the relative phase and the polarisation of the lasers) and still
have the freedom to be further optimised against the most relevant experimental noise
sources. In particular, we will choose a staggered order angular momentum state as our
target state, which has a lot of physically interesting properties [10, 12, 13, 38]. This
non-trivial state has an anti–ferromagnetic type ordering, which consist of each potential

well being occupied by a single atom, carrying alternating angular momentum ≈ ±

(see ﬁgure 1). We will propose a method which, starting from a Mott–insulator state,
prepares such an anti–ferromagnetic type ordering by shaking the lattice. The state we
create can be seen as a stepping stone towards more complex higher band states and
the method we present is readily extendible to generate other states. It should be noted
that shortcuts have been suggested previously for the creation of angular momentum in
ultracold atom systems [39, 40].

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the subsequent section, we
outline our model for the shaken optical lattice. In Section 3, we review the method of
Lewis–Riesenfeld invariants. In Section 4, we outline the diﬀerent schemes used in order
to prepare the angular momentum state. In Section 5, we perform numerical simulation
of the full Schr¨odinger equation for a single atom in one site of an optical lattice in order
to verify our assumptions. In Section 6, we remark on some experimental consideration.
Finally in Section 7, we discuss our results.

2. Model

2.1. Optical lattice

We consider a two–dimensional optical lattice (in the x–y plane) generated by two pairs
of counter–propagating laser beams. We assume a strong conﬁnement in the z direction
such that only dynamics in the x–y plane are relevant. We also assume that the atoms
are in the Mott insulator regime i.e. each site is occupied by a single atom which is
eﬀectively independent of all the others. One can enter such a regime by having a
large lattice depth so that tunnelling rates are small. While this means it is suﬃcient
to consider each atom separately in the following, it is important to note that the all
operations presented here are global and will aﬀect all the atoms/sites simultaneously.
The complex amplitude of the electric ﬁeld of the laser beams generating the two–

dimensional optical lattice is

(cid:126)E(x, y, t) = (cid:126)E0 sin{k [x − rx(t)]} + i(cid:126)E0e

−iρ(t) sin{k [y − ry(t)]} ,

(1)

where rx(t) and ry(t) deﬁne the position of the minimum of the central trap, and can
be controlled by a time-dependent phase diﬀerence between the pair of laser beams in
each direction. When these are modulated periodically, it results in a shaking of the
lattice. We will see below that this shaking alone is insuﬃcient to create the desired
quantum state. Therefore, we assume in addition that the polarisation vectors in the
two directions have an equal amplitude (cid:126)E0, but with a slowly varying relative phase ρ(t).
The potential felt by an atom in the two–dimensional optical lattice is given by [2]

V (x, y) =

,

(2)

where (cid:126)µ is the transition dipole moment of the atom and ∆ (assumed to be large) is
the detuning of the laser with respect to the atomic transition frequency. Deﬁning the
lattice depth as

V0 =

(4)

the potential can be written as

V (x, y) = V0 sin2 {k [x − rx(t)]} + V0 sin2 {k [y − ry(t)]}
+ Vρ(t) sin{k [x − rx(t)]} sin{k [y − ry(t)]} ,

where Vρ(t) = 2V0 sin [ρ(t)] is the amplitude of the interference term, restricted to the
interval [−2V0, 2V0]. Without any loss of generality, we assume that the laser is blue
detuned (∆ > 0) so that V0 is positive.

We now change from the lab frame to the lattice frame (see Appendix A for details),

where the Hamiltonian takes the form

Hlattice(t) = H0 + H1(t),

2
2m∇2 + V0 sin2(kx) + V0 sin2(ky),

H0 = −
H1(t) = m¨rx(t)x + m¨ry(t)y + Vρ(t) sin(kx) sin(ky).

various couplings between them.

It is worth noting at this point that without the Vρ term, the Hamiltonian would be
separable in x and y and therefore unable to create entanglement between the x and y
degrees of freedom, which is necessary for angular momentum states. We will assume
the shaking of the lattice to be of the form

rx(t) = − gx(t) cos(ωxt),
ry(t) = gy(t) sin(ωyt),

(8)

where gx,y(t) are the time–dependent amplitudes and ωx,y are the frequencies. By
assuming that gx,y(t) vary slowly with time, H1(t) simpliﬁes to

H1(t) = fx(t) x + fy(t) y + Vρ(t) sin(kx) sin(ky),

where

fx(t) = mω2
fy(t) = −mω2

xgx(t) cos(ωxt),
ygy(t) sin(ωyt).

(9)

(10)

(11)

In this case the shaking in the y direction is π/2 out of phase with the shaking in x
direction.

2.2. Four–level approximation

Our aim is to derive the control schemes, i.e., the time dependence of the functions
rx(t), ry(t) and Vρ(t), which will lead to a desired ﬁnal state. To do this we will now
derive a simpliﬁed model of the system by concentrating on a single atom in a single
well of the lattice deﬁned by −(cid:96) ≤ x ≤ (cid:96) and −(cid:96) ≤ y ≤ (cid:96), where 2(cid:96) = π/k is the lattice
constant. The situation where the neighbouring lattice potential wells can be neglected
is very well realised in the Mott insulator regime.

Furthermore, we assume that the dynamics can be eﬀectively described by a four–
level approximation, considering only the four most relevant eigenstates of H0 localised
in the central site, {|00(cid:105),|10(cid:105),|01(cid:105),|11(cid:105)} (see ﬁgure 2). The validity of this and all
subsequent approximations will be checked later by comparing with the numerical

integration of the full Schr¨odinger equation. In coordinate representation, these basis
states are given by

(cid:104)(cid:126)r|ij(cid:105) = Γi(x)Γj(y),

(12)

where Γ0(x) and Γ1(x) are, respectively, the localised ground and ﬁrst excited states
of a one–dimensional unperturbed optical lattice site. Note that this is only possible
because H0 is separable in x and y. Their respective energies are Eij = ωij, where
E00 < E01 = E10 < E11.

Let us now deﬁne a unitary transformation of the form

U (t) = e

−i(ω10+ωx)t|00(cid:105)(cid:104)00| + e
−iω10t|10(cid:105)(cid:104)10| + e

Note that the symmetry of the unperturbed lattice gives ω11 = 2ω10 − ω00.

We now assume that the shaking of the lattice in both directions is done on

resonance, i.e., ωx = ωy = −ωd. This allows to write the four–level Hamiltonian as

It is important to note that state |11(cid:105) can not be neglected and should be included in
the approximation, as it is resonantly coupled to |01(cid:105) and |10(cid:105).

2.3. Initial and target states

Our goal is to perform a state transfer from the ground state |00(cid:105) to an angular
momentum state of the form

|±(cid:105) =

1
√2

(|10(cid:105) ± i|01(cid:105)) .

(24)

If the harmonic approximation holds, |±(cid:105) are eigenvectors of the z component of the
angular momentum operator Lz with eigenvalues ±.

One can see that the interference term in (7), which includes Vρ, alternates sign at
each lattice site in a checkerboard pattern. In the case where Ωy = 0, this can be seen
as a change of basis |01(cid:105) → −|01(cid:105) and |11(cid:105) → −|11(cid:105) and hence one obtains either |+(cid:105)
or |−(cid:105) in alternating sites, leading to the pattern in Fig. 1. For our schemes we will
assume that Ωy = 0, although more general schemes might be derived in a similar way.
In the following, we will use the technique of Lewis–Riesenfeld invariants to derive
shortcut schemes to implement the state transfer |00(cid:105) → |−(cid:105). An advantage of this
method is that one still has a certain freedom to optimise the stability of the schemes
against the most relevant error sources in a speciﬁc setting [33, 34, 35, 36, 37].

3. Lewis–Riesenfeld invariants for the four–level system

One possible technique to derive shortcuts to adiabaticity is based on Lewis–Riesenfeld
invariants [41]. A Lewis–Riesenfeld invariant for a Hamiltonian H(t) is a Hermitian
operator I(t) which satisﬁes

∂I
∂t

+

i
 [H, I] = 0.

(25)

Since I(t) is a constant of motion it can be shown that it has time–independent
eigenvalues and that a particular solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,

i ∂

∂t |ψn(t)(cid:105) = H(t)|ψn(t)(cid:105) ,

(26)

Creating exotic angular momentum states by shaking an optical lattice

can be written as

|ψn(t)(cid:105) = eiβn(t) |φn(t)(cid:105) .
(cid:90) t
Here |φn(t)(cid:105) is an instantaneous eigenstate of I(t) and
0 (cid:104)φn(s) |[i∂s − H(s)]| φn(s)(cid:105) ds

βn(t) =

1


8

(27)

(28)

is the Lewis–Riesenfeld phase. Hence a general solution to the Schr¨odinger equation can
be written as

|ψ(t)(cid:105) =

cn |ψn(t)(cid:105)

(29)

(cid:88)

n

where the cn are independent of time.

The idea behind inverse engineering is that instead of following the instantaneous
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian (as in the adiabatic case), one follows the instantaneous
eigenstate of the invariant (up to the Lewis–Riesenfeld phase). Demanding that the
invariant and the Hamiltonian commute at the start and the end of the process i.e.,
[I(0), H(0)] = [I(T ), H(T )] = 0, one ensures that the eigenstates of the invariant and
the Hamiltonian coincide at initial and ﬁnal times. This leaves the freedom to choose
how the state evolves in the intermediate time and then use (25) to determine how the
Hamiltonian should vary with time to ensure such a state evolution.

In the following we will derive the invariant for the Hamiltonian in (22) with Ωy = 0.
For a more detailed review of Lewis–Riesenfeld invariants for four level systems see [42].
Following the general method proposed in [43, 44], we start with a closed Lie algebra

4. Shaking schemes for preparing an angular momentum state

In this section, we present two schemes which allow us to prepare our target state.
In order to design the scheme we start by constructing a solution to the Schr¨odinger
equation as a linear combination of two of the eigenvectors of the invariant

The initial and ﬁnal state of the system are ﬁxed as

|ψ(0)(cid:105) = |00(cid:105),
|ψ(T )(cid:105) = |−(cid:105),

which leads to the boundary conditions

α1(0) = 0, α2(0) = (C1 − Q)/2,
α1(T ) = 0, α2(T ) = (C1 + Q)/2, β4(T ) = 0,

in the limits t → 0 and t → T .

We also demand that Ωx, Ωρ and their respective derivative are zero at the start
and the end of the process. This requires that all the derivatives of α1(t) and α2(t) up
to fourth order are zero at t = 0 and t = T , which gives 10 constraints to be fulﬁlled by
α1(t) and also 10 constraints for α2(t).

4.1. Polynomial scheme

A convenient choice of ansatz for α1(t) and α2(t) which fulﬁlls all the constraints is given
by polynomials of the form

α1(sT ) = 1024W (−s10 + 5s9 − 10s8 + 10s7 − 5s6 + s5),
α2(sT ) =

where s = t/T . To avoid the trivial solution α1(sT ) = 0 we also demand α1(T /2) =
W (cid:54)= 0. We are now allowed to arbitrarily pick C1 = 10 and C2 = 11 so that Q (cid:54)= 0
and α3(t) is real for all times. We also set ξ = +1 and then numerically calculate W
(≈ −2.74) so that β4(T ) = 0. The coupling strengths Ωx(t) and Ωρ(t) can be calulated
from Eqs. (33) and (34), and are shown in ﬁgure 3 (dashed lines).

Let us underline again that this is just one possible choice for the auxiliary functions
α1(t) and α2(t) (and the constants C1 and C2). The advantage of this inverse–
engineering ansatz is that it provides a lot of freedom in choosing these functions which
can be used for further optimisations [33].

4.2. Piecewise scheme

The second example we introduce to generate our target state is a simple piecewise
scheme. The idea is to ﬁrst perform a π pulse in Ωx (of duration tS) which transfers
all the population from |00(cid:105) to |10(cid:105), followed by a π/2 pulse in Ωρ (of duration T − tS)
which leads to the superposition |−(cid:105). This method has the advantage that the state
|11(cid:105) is never populated, which reduces the chance of losing population to higher levels.
The amplitudes of the couplings are determined by tS and are given by (see ﬁgure 3

equation with Hamiltonian (5) in coordinate space for an atom initially in the ground
state of a single lattice site.

(cid:113) 2V0k2

The evolution is performed by means of the Fourier split–operator method [45],
where the initial ground state is found by imaginary–time evolution. In order to make
all plots dimensionless we deﬁne ω =
m , which is the frequency of the harmonic
oscillator potential which approximates each well of the optical lattice. Note that the
previously deﬁned ωd = ω10 − ω00 converges to ω for increasing lattice depth V0. The
rotating wave approximation and the slowly–varying shaking amplitude approximation
can be combined in the condition T (cid:29) ω

As we have assumed to be in the Mott–insulator regime, we restrict our simulations
to the dynamics of an atom in a single well. We have checked the validity of this
approximation by simulating our schemes in a 3×3 lattice. With the typical parameters
used below, the shaking causes only about a 1% leakage into the neighbouring traps.

The resulting functions for both the polynomial process and the piecewise process are

small fraction of the lattice constant.

The results of the numerical simulation of both schemes are shown in ﬁgure 5,
together with the ideal populations based on the four–level Hamiltonian in (22). Using
the polynomial scheme, even for a short total time T = 100ω−1 (ﬁgure 5(a)), the
ﬁnal population in the desired state is already greater than 90%, with about 5% of
population leaking to states outside of the four–level model. For a longer total time T

is almost perfect, ending up with nearly 100% in the desired state.

Similarly for the piecewise scheme, the dynamics for a short total time (ﬁgure 5(c))
leads to oscillations and a non–perfect population of the target state, and approximately
a 10% population of higher lying states. However, for longer T (ﬁgure 5(d)), the ﬁnal
ﬁdelity is nearly 100%. Note that since the second pulse Ωρ in this scheme does not
require the rotating wave approximation, it is beneﬁcial to give the ﬁrst pulse a longer
duration. Hence the choice of tS = 0.75T .

The ﬁdelity of both schemes for diﬀerent total times T and diﬀerent lattice depths
V0 is shown in ﬁgure 6; the lattice constant 2(cid:96) = π/k is varied in such a way that the
trapping frequency ω =
m is kept ﬁxed. From this we can see again how for a larger
T we achieve higher ﬁdelities, which is consistent with the rotating wave approximation
and the slowly varying shaking amplitude approximation becoming more valid. We can
also see that the ﬁdelities decrease for deeper lattices because as the well becomes deeper
it becomes more harmonic and hence has equally spaced energy levels. This leads to
resonant coupling to higher energy levels (see Appendix B for details).

(cid:113) 2V0k2

In the following, we want to examine the stability of the schemes. In ﬁgure 7(a),
we show the resonance curve for both processes, i.e., the ﬁdelity against the detuning
of the shaking frequency with respect to the frequency diﬀerence of the ﬁrst two levels.
We compare the four–level model(not assuming ωx = −ωd) against the full Schr¨odinger
equation dynamics. As expected, one achieves high ﬁdelity when the shaking frequency
is on resonance. Perhaps surprisingly one can note that the highest ﬁdelity of the full
dynamics is achieved for a slightly oﬀ resonant shaking frequency. This is not true in
the four–level model, as the corresponding curves have their maximum at resonance.
The reason for this is the presence of an oﬀ resonant coupling to the state |20(cid:105)(which
is not present in the four-level model). By slightly increasing the detuning of Ωx with
respect to the |00(cid:105) ↔ |10(cid:105) transition, an even greater detuning in the coupling between
|10(cid:105) and |20(cid:105) is created, leading to less leakage to these higher states. We can verify this

by considering a six–level model (see Appendix B), which can be seen to agree with the
full Schr¨odinger equation dynamics (see ﬁgure 7(b))

Finally, we remark once again that in the case of more lattice sites, each containing
a single atom, the schemes would result in the pattern in ﬁgure 1. As a brief aside, we
now consider a single atom whose initial state is now a superposition of all ground states
of all 9 wells of a 3 × 3 lattice; the single atom is de–localised across the entire lattice.
Applying here the piecewise shaking scheme, one reaches the ﬁnal state represented in
ﬁgure 8. It can be clearly seen that a checkerboard pattern of left- and right-handed
angular momentum states is produced, similar to ﬁgure 1. Note that we have adjusted
the (physical irrelevant) global phase such that the branch cut is horizontal in this
representation of the wave function. In this case, we have produced a ﬁnal state for a
single atom in which its position is entangled with the sign of the angular momentum
in each well.

6. Experimental considerations

There are several options for experimentally implementing such a system depending on
how one creates the two counter propagating beams for each direction. One option is
to use a beam and a retro-reﬂecting mirror, in which case one can induce the shaking
by mounting the mirror on a piezo-electric actuator which will then oscillate according
to rx(t) [46, 47, 48]. In the case where the beam is split in two, one can introduce a
small frequency diﬀerence ∆ν(t) between the beams by using acousto-optic modulators
to make the lattice move with a velocity ∆ν(t)λ/2, where λ is the wavelength of the
laser [49, 48]. The shaking is then given by rx(t) = λ

obtains a ground state tunnelling time of /J0 ≈ 600ms and an excited state tunnelling
time of /J1 ≈ 17ms. Being in the Mott insulator ground state corresponds to a

potential depth of about 22Er [4]. Being in the Mott state for both the ground state
and the ﬁrst excited state will not be aﬀected by the shaking, as it has been shown
both theoretically [51] and experimentally [52] that the shaking eﬀectively reduces the
tunnelling strength to the neighbouring wells. In addition, the anharmonic nature of
the potential inhibits ﬁrst order decay processes [10] .

7. Conclusions

We have developed two schemes to prepare an exotic lattice state, namely a staggered
order angular momentum state, starting from a Mott insulator state in an optical lattice.
Both of these are using shaking of the optical lattice together with a modulation of the
interference term. The ﬂexibility of the invariant–based approach presented in this paper
makes it possible to extend this research in multiple directions. For instance, one could

Creating exotic angular momentum states by shaking an optical lattice

17

further optimise the scheme to combat the most relevant errors in a given experimental
implementation [33].

It is also possible to extend this idea to prepare a similar state with higher angular
momentum per lattice site or by including the Ωy term to prepare a state with equal
angular momentum per lattice site. If the shaking process is applied to a single de–
localised atom, the ﬁnal state can be seen as an entangled state where the well position
is entangled with the sign of the angular momentum.

One can see that for deep (i.e. harmonic) potential wells ω10 − ω20 = −ωd and

ω20 = ω11. For ωx = −ωd and in the rotating–wave approximation, one gets

This clearly shows that for deep lattices a strong resonant coupling to levels |20(cid:105) and
|02(cid:105) exists, and therefore the four–level approximation becomes invalid in this limit.
