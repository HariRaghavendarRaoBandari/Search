1 Introduction
The study of the high-multiplicity pp events has become important because we need to under-
stand the origin of the ﬂuid-like features which have been found in such small systems [1–4].

In this work we concentrate on the radial ﬂow signatures, which not only hydrodynamical
models can explain. Namely, the effect has been also found in PYTHIA [5] and it is attributed
to multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) via boosted color strings [6]. For
high-multiplicity events, the blast-wave parametrization, a hydro inspired model, has been found
to ﬁt very well the transverse momentum (pT) spectra of different particle species [7]. Although,
the quality of the ﬁts become worse for low-multiplicity events, we see that the parameter related
to the average transverse expansion velocity ((cid:104)βT(cid:105)) increases with increasing multiplicity. This
effect is qualitatively similar to what has been seen at the LHC [8].

In PYTHIA, color reconnection was originally introduced in order to explain the rise of the av-
erage pT with the event multiplicity. In short, the model allows the interaction among the partons
which originate from MPI and initial-/ﬁnal-state radiation. There are different implementations,
e.g., the default MPI-based model of PYTHIA8.212 introduces a probability which is the largest for
a low-pT system to be reconnected with one of a harder pT scale. And the interaction between two
systems of high-pT scales is not allowed. Such a soft-hard interaction also suggests that jets may
play a role in the observed radial ﬂow-like patterns as highlighted in [7, 9].

In this work, the role of jets in high-multiplicity pp collisions is investigated using PYTHIA 8.212.
The inclusive pT spectra of identiﬁed particles are studied for events with and without jets, where
the jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT algorithm implemented in FastJet [10].

2 Results
s = 7 TeV were simulated with PYTHIA8.212 using the tune Monash
Proton-proton collisions at
2013 [11]. Events were classiﬁed according with their event multiplicity (Nch) and leading jet pT
T ). All the observables were calculated counting particles within |η|<1. For the jet ﬁnder only
(pjet
detectable particles (including charged and neutral particles) are considered within cone radius of
0.4, while for the pT spectra and event multiplicity only charged particles are taken into account.
To investigate on the radial ﬂow-like effects in jets we ﬁrst study the proton-to-pion ratio in
low-multiplicity events and as a function of pjet
T (see Fig. 1). It is worth noticing that events without
jets1 dominate for momenta below 2 GeV/c, while at larger momenta, jets start playing a more
important role. In addition, a bump at intermediate pT is observed in all the event classes. The
pT, where the peak emerges, increases with increasing pjet
T . This structure resembles one observed
in the different colliding systems at the LHC [1, 12] and which sometimes is referred as a “ﬂow
peak” [6]. This effect is the same in events generated with and without color reconnection.

T intervals (markers) are compared with the inclusive case (solid line). Events with (left) and
without (right) color reconnection are shown.

√

The blast-wave analysis of the pT spectra has been performed using the same particle species
and pT intervals described in [7]. Figure 2 shows that the hydro model can describe the PYTHIA
pT spectra when jets with momentum above 5 GeV/c are part of the event. Actually, a (cid:104)βT(cid:105) of
≈0.5 can be achieved when the jet pT is larger than 20 GeV/c. Contrarily, the model does not
describe the spectra in events without jets. This result is consistent with the spherocity analysis
reported in [7], where it was argued that the fast parent parton being a boosted system can mimic
radial ﬂow too. The same analysis was also implemented for high-multiplicity events, in that
case, thanks to color reconnection, the quality of the ﬁt improves in events without jets, however
a small (cid:104)βT(cid:105) (≈0.37) is obtained and it increases up to ≈0.51 when a high-pT jet is identiﬁed in the

Actually, when a high-pT jet was required, a very weak multiplicity dependence of (cid:104)βT(cid:105) is
observed.

3 Summary
In summary, we have studied the role of jets in the radial ﬂow-like features of PYTHIA. We have
found that even in low-multiplicity events the blast-wave model is able to describe the pT spectra
of different particle species only when jets are part of the event. At high-multiplicity, (cid:104)βT(cid:105) can
be very small in events without jets (≈0.37). The interaction of jets with the soft component is
therefore important to produce the observed effects in PYTHIA. This seems to be a promising tool
which could be exploited by the experiments in order to understand better the LHC data.
