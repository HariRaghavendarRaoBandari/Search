We study the frictional drag between carriers in two bilayer graphene ﬂakes separated by a 2 − 5
nm thick hexagonal boron nitride dielectric. At temperatures (T ) lower than ∼ 10 K, we observe a
large anomalous negative drag emerging predominantly near the drag layer charge neutrality. The
anomalous drag resistivity increases dramatically with reducing T, and becomes comparable to the
layer resistivity at the lowest T = 1.5 K. At low T the drag resistivity exhibits a breakdown of layer
reciprocity. A comparison of the drag resistivity and the drag layer Peltier coeﬃcient suggests a
thermoelectric origin of this anomalous drag.

Interaction between isolated electron systems in close
proximity can produce a wealth of novel phenomena.
A particularly striking example is frictional drag where
charge current (IDrive) ﬂowing in one (drive) layer in-
duces a voltage drop in the opposite (drag) layer, VDrag =
RDIDrive. At the heart of the transresistance RD are
inter-layer couplings without particle exchange which can
be mediated by e.g., momentum exchange [1], energy
transfer [2], or phonons [3]. While being a sensitive probe
of inter-layer interactions, the RD values are generally
much smaller than the layer resistance. An exception oc-
curs when the carriers in the two layers form a correlated
state, yielding RD that can reach values comparable to
the layer resistance.
Indeed, this has been experimen-
tally reported in GaAs electron [4], or hole [5] double
layer systems, in magnetic ﬁelds such that each layer has
one half-ﬁlled Landau level [6].

Extensive experimental eﬀort has been devoted to
probe drag in electron-hole double layers, using GaAs
electron-hole double layers [7, 8], graphene double layers
[9, 10], and most recently graphene-GaAs double layers
[11], motivated in part by the search for equilibrium in-
direct exciton condensates. A common thread in these
experiments is an anomalous RD that increases with re-
ducing T , along with a breakdown of layer reciprocity
when interchanging the drive and drag layers [7, 8, 11].
In this regard, double bilayer graphene separated by a
thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a particularly com-
pelling system. The near parabolic energy-momentum
dispersion in bilayer graphene allows the Coulomb to ki-
netic energy ratio to be tuned via density, unlike mono-
layer graphene where this ratio is ﬁxed [12]. Moreover,
the availability of ultra-thin dielectrics allows double lay-
ers to be realized with interlayer spacing (d) down to a
few nm, granting access to the strong coupling regime
d (cid:28) l, where l is the inter-particle distance. This ef-
fectively nests the two isolated electronic systems in the
same plane. Here, we investigate the frictional drag in
double bilayer graphene heterostructures, consisting of
two bilayer graphene separated by a 2 − 5 nm thick in-
terlayer hBN dielectric, which allows us to explore the
drag in a wide range of layer densities and for all combi-

nations of carrier polarity. Strikingly, we ﬁnd a giant and
negative drag resistivity at charge neutrality, comparable
to the layer resistivity at the lowest T .

The samples [Fig. 1(a)] are fabricated using a layer-
by-layer transfer process similar to samples discussed in
[13]. The layer densities are tuned using a combination of
back-gate (VBG), and interlayer bias applied on the top
bilayer (VTL) [14]. The top (ρT) and bottom (ρB) bilayer
resistivities, as well as the frictional drag are probed us-
ing small signal, low frequency lock-in techniques. We
investigated ﬁve samples, labeled A-E, with diﬀerent in-
terlayer spacing and layer mobilities. The key features of
the drag data discussed below are similar in all samples.
Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show ρB and ρT measured in
Sample A at T = 1.5 K. The bottom bilayer responds to
VBG and VTL similar to a dual-gated bilayer graphene,
in which the density and transverse electric ﬁeld (E) are
controlled independently [15]. The locus of high resis-
tance points in Figs. 1(b,c) marks the charge neutrality
lines for both bilayers. Figure 1(c) also shows the car-
rier type in each of the four quadrants deﬁned by the
two charge neutrality lines. To examine variations in the
drag resistance when interchanging the drag and drive
layers, we probe both the bottom (ρD,B) and top (ρD,T)
drag resistivities, with the top or bottom bilayers serv-
ing as the drive layers, respectively. Figures 1(d) and
1(e) show ρD,B and ρD,T, respectively, measured as a
function of VBG and VTL in Sample A, at T = 1.5 K.
A comparison of Fig. 1(b,c) data on one hand, and Fig.
1(d,e) data on the other, shows a large, negative drag
resistivity emerging predominantly near or at the drag
layer charge neutrality.

To better visualize Fig. 1(d,e) data, in Fig. 2 we plot
ρD,B [panel (a)] and ρD,T [panel (b)] as a function of top
(nT) and bottom (nB) bilayer densities, converted from
VBG and VTL. The nT and nB values are related to the
applied VBG and VTL biases, referenced with respect to
nB = nT = 0, via: eVBG = e2(nB + nT)/CBG + µB and
eVTL = −e2nT/Cint + µB − µT, where CBG and Cint are
the back-gate and interlayer capacitances, µT and µB are
the top and bottom bilayers chemical potentials, respec-
tively, e is the electron charge. To convert VBG and VTL

close to 1 kΩ. Second, the reciprocity with respect to
interchanging the drag and drive layers breaks down, i.e.
ρD,B(nB, nT) (cid:54)= ρD,T(nB, nT) in Fig. 2.

In light of the anomalous drag observed in Figs. 1 and
2, in the following we examine the drag layer resistivity
in more detail, concentrating on the drag layer density,
and transverse electric ﬁeld (E) dependencies. The latter
is relevant for bilayer graphene as the energy-momentum
dispersion changes with E, concomitant with gap open-
ing at charge neutrality [17]. Figure 3(a) shows Sam-
ple A ρB, ρD,B, and the corresponding normalized drag
ρD,B/ρB as a function of nB = −nT, namely at equal den-
sity in the two bilayers, with opposite polarity carriers.
ρD,B shows a very strong, negative peak at DNP, which
surprisingly becomes comparable to ρB at T = 1.5 K.
As nB = −nT increases ρD,B changes sign, becomes pos-
itive at a ﬁnite |nB|, and then vanishes as |nB| increases
further.

Figure 3(b) shows ρB, ρD,B (left panel), and ρD,B/ρB
(right panel) vs. nB in the proximity of nB = 0 and nT
(cid:54)= 0. The negative ρD,B at nB = 0 is notable, similar
to the large, negative ρD,B peak at DNP in Fig. 3(a).
However, the magnitude of ρD,B/ρB at nB = 0 and nT
(cid:54)= 0 is smaller than that at DNP. As |nB| increases, ρD,B

ity emerging along the drag layer charge neutrality, relatively
insensitive to the drive layer density.

to layer densities we use the density-dependent chemical
potential determined experimentally [13]. The CBG and
Cint values are determined using magnetotransport mea-
surements of individual bilayers [16]. Figure 2 reveals a
number of interesting features. First, ρD,B is large in the
proximity of nB = 0 line in Fig. 2(a), while ρD,T is large
near nT = 0 line in Fig. 2(b). Near the double neutrality
point (DNP), nB = nT = 0 ρD,B and ρD,T reach values

changes polarity, and becomes positive, consistent with
the observed trend at DNP, albeit with a lower magni-
tude. An examination of the electrostatics in double lay-
ers shows that at nB = 0, the E value across the bottom
bilayer changes as nT changes as indicated in Fig. 3(b)
legend (Supplementary Material). We observe that ρD,B
at nB = 0 grows as ρB increases with increasing E-ﬁeld,
leading to a relatively constant ρD,B/ρB ratio.

Figure 3(c) shows ρD,B as a function of nB = −nT at
diﬀerent T in Sample A, showing a large, negative drag
at DNP. We note that Fig. 3(a,b) and Fig. 3(c) were col-
lected in separate cooldowns. Similar to Fig. 3(a) data,
ρD,B becomes positive as |nB| increases, and subsequently
decreases towards zero with increasing density. The inset
of Fig. 3(c) summarizes the T -dependence of the negative
peak of both ρD,B and ρD,T at DNP, showing a decrease
of the drag resistivity with increasing T . At the lowest
T , mesoscopic ﬂuctuations [14] are also noticeable in the
proximity of DNP in Fig. 3(c), superimposed onto the
large negative drag.

The experimental observations in Figs. 1-3 have several
anomalous features at variance with existing Coulomb
drag theories. It is tempting to interpret the giant drag
that develops at DNP at low T prima facie as a signa-
ture of a correlated state of the two layers. However,
the fact that the drag voltage is negative, namely oppo-
site to the electric ﬁeld in the drive layer, coupled with
the layer reciprocity breakdown casts doubt on this in-
terpretation. Moreover, the increasing ρD observed with
decreasing T [Fig. 3(c)] is opposite to the expected de-
pendence for momentum transfer mediated drag [1] . The
increasing drag at the lowest T , coupled with the appar-
ent breakdown of reciprocity bears similarity with data
reported in electron-hole double layers in GaAs-AlGaAs
[7] or GaAs-graphene heterostructures [11]. We note that
the interlayer separations in [7, 11] were larger than 10

nm, and the magnitude of the measured drag resistiv-
ity was two orders of magnitude smaller than the values
probed in the double bilayer graphene heterostructures
investigated here. Indeed, the ρD,B ≈ ρB is a dramatic
signature of the strong coupling regime in double layers.
To gain insight into the origin of the anomalous drag
we ﬁrst note that the ρD,B and ρB peaks in Fig. 3(a) have
similar widths. The giant peak at the DNP is reminiscent
of energy drag near charge neutrality in double mono-
layer graphene heterostructures [2, 10], where Coulomb
mediated vertical energy transfer coupled with correlated
density inhomogeneity in the two layers yields a drag re-
sistivity of thermoelectric origin, with the polarity deter-
mined by interlayer correlations (cid:104)δµBδµT(cid:105). To assess the
role of thermoelectricity in our measurements we use the
Mott relation for the Peltier coeﬃcient [18, 19]:

Q =

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and σ the layer con-
ductivity. Using Eq. (1) along with σ = 1/ρB measured
in the bottom bilayer graphene, the experimental µ vs.
nB data (Fig. S1) [13], and nB vs. VBG and VTL (Fig.
S2), we obtain QB vs. µB.
In Fig. 4(a) (main panel) we compare the µB depen-
dence of ρD,B and −∂QB/∂µB in Sample A at T = 1.5
K. Figure 4(a) inset shows ρB vs. µB. Both ρD,B and
ρB were measured while sweeping the layer densities such
that nB = −nT. Remarkably, both ρD,B and −∂QB/∂µB
show a peak at charge neutrality, change polarity as |µB|
increases, and vanish at even larger |µB| values. Interest-
ingly, the peak structure of energy drag in Ref. [2] arises
from ∂Q/∂µ.
The striking similarity between the µB-dependence of
ρD,B and −∂QB/∂µB strongly suggests a thermoelectric
origin for the large frictional drag observed at low T in

our double bilayer graphene. To further test this hy-
pothesis, in Fig. 4(b) we compare the µ value at which
ρD changes polarity (|µDrag=0|), and the µ value at which
the drag layer ∂Q/∂µ changes its polarity (|µdQ/dµ=0|)
for multiple samples. The |µDrag=0| and |µdQ/dµ=0|
are averaged over the µ values on both electron and
hole branches, and represent the half width of the ρD
peak and the drag layer ∂Q/∂µ peak, respectively. The
|µDrag=0| and |µdQ/dµ=0| values are determined using
frictional drag measurements in either bottom or top bi-
layer graphene from ﬁve samples with diﬀerent interlayer
thickness and layer mobility. Furthermore, the data are
collected at diﬀerent drive layer densities, not only at
DNP. Figure 4(b) clearly indicates that |µDrag=0| agrees
very well with |µdQ/dµ=0|, suggesting that the overall be-
havior of the anomalous drag at low T is governed by
the drag layer ∂Q/∂µ. Consistent with Figs. 1 and 2
data showing that ρD depends largely on the drag layer
density, we do not ﬁnd a correlation between the drag
resistivity and the drive layer ∂Q/∂µ.

While reminiscent of energy drag, the giant drag mea-
sured here deviates from the simple energy drag picture
presented in Ref. [2]. Also striking is the layer non-
reciprocity, ampliﬁed by the giant drag at DNP [Fig.
3(a)]. We note that Ref. [2] assumes fully overlapping lay-
ers with identical geometries, and contact conﬁgurations.
In contrast, in the actual devices examined here the ge-
ometry and contact conﬁgurations of the drive/drag lay-
ers are diﬀerent [Fig. 1(a)]. As a result, anisotropic heat
ﬂow due to sample geometry [20] as well as Peltier heat-
ing outside of the active layers may contribute to the
layer non-reciprocity in our drag measurements. A fuller
understanding of the origin of broken layer reciprocity at
low T is the subject of intense current research.
The polarity of the energy drag is determined by the
sign of potential ﬂuctuations in graphene, (cid:104)δµBδµT(cid:105) [2].
A negative drag of thermoelectric origin measured at
DNP indicates that (cid:104)δµBδµT(cid:105) < 0. This suggests that
strain [21], rather than charged impurities [22] dominates
the density inhomogeneity. For impurity induced inho-
mogeneity (cid:104)δµBδµT(cid:105) > 0, and a positive drag is expected
at charge neutrality. The clearly developed, broken sym-
metry integer quantum Hall states in our samples (Sup-
plementary Material) also prove the high sample quality
with low level of impurities.

Lastly, we discuss similarities and diﬀerences between
the energy drag previously observed in double mono-
layer graphene heterostructures [10, 23], and the drag
in double bilayer graphene heterostructures. The drag
in monolayer graphene shows a peak at the DNP, has a
positive value, and is maximum at higher temperatures,
T (cid:39) 70 K. The positive drag at DNP is understood as
energy drag where impurity induced disorder creates a
positive correlation of the layer chemical potential ﬂuc-
tuations (cid:104)δµBδµT(cid:105) [2]. Interestingly, a comparison of the
monolayer and bilayer graphene Peltier coeﬃcients us-

ing Eq. (1) shows that the higher density of states and
smaller σ at charge neutrality in bilayer graphene yields
a much larger ∂Q/∂µ, and consequently larger drag at
charge neutrality by comparison to monolayer graphene,
in agreement with the experimental observations (see
Supplementary Material).
In summary, we report an anomalous giant, negative
frictional drag (cid:39) 1 kΩ in high mobility double bilayer
graphene near the drag layer charge neutrality at tem-
peratures lower than 10 K, with values approaching that
of layer resistivity. The drag increases with decreasing
T down to T = 1.5 K, and does not obey the layer reci-
procity. This opens an unanticipated playground for ex-
ploring new electron-interaction mediated phenomena in
double layer systems even at zero ﬁeld.
