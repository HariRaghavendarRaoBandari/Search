Abstract. A ﬁrst-principles study of the electronic and superconducting properties
of the Ni2VAl Heusler compound is presented. The electron-phonon coupling constant
of λep = 0.68 is obtained, which leads to a superconducting transition temperature of
Tc = ∼4 K (assuming a Coulomb pseudopotential µ∗ = 0.13), which is a relatively
high transition temperature for Ni based Heusler alloys. The electronic density of
states reveals a signiﬁcant hybridization between Ni-eg and V-t2g states around the
Fermi level. The Fermi surface, consisting of two electron pockets around the X-
points of the Brillouin zone, exhibits nesting and leads to a Kohn anomaly of the
phonon dispersion relation for the transverse acoustic mode TA2 along the (1,1,0)
direction, which is furthermore found to soften with pressure. As a consequence, Tc
and λep vary non-monotonically under pressure. The calculations are compared to
similar calculations performed for the Ni2NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) Heusler alloys,
which experimentally have been identiﬁed as superconductors. The experimental trend
in Tc is well reproduced, and reasonable quantitative agreement is obtained. The
calculated Tc of Ni2VAl is larger than either calculated and observed Tcs of any of
the Nb compounds. The Fermi surfaces of Ni2NbAl and Ni2NbGa consist of only a
single electron pocket around the X point, however under compression second electron
pocket similar to that of Ni2VAl emerges only in Ni2NbAl and the Tc increases non
monotonically in all the compounds. Fermi surface nesting and associated Kohn
anomalies are a common feature of all four compounds, albeit weakest in Ni2VAl.

1. Introduction

Heusler alloys are ternary intermetallic compounds of the form X2YZ, where X is
generally a transition metal, Y is yet another transition metal from group VIIIB-IB
and Z is a sp metal or a metalloid. These compounds display a wide range of physical
properties including halfmetallicity[1, 2, 3, 4], magnetic ordering[5, 6], heavy fermion
behaviour[7, 8, 9], shape memory eﬀect [10, 11] and thermoelectricity[12, 13]. Some are
superconductors having a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) ranging from
0.74 K (HfNi2Al) to 4.7 K (YPd2Sn). Superconductivity was ﬁrst reported for the
Heusler alloys by Ishikawa et al.
[14], where they focused mainly on the systems
RPd2Sn and RPd2Pb with R being a rare-earth metal. Among the known Heusler
superconductors, Ni-based alloys Ni2NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) have attracted much
attention due to their intermediate electron phonon coupling constant [15, 16, 17].
Interestingly, the Ni2NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) compounds are paramegnets and are
found to be superconductors although Ni is a ferromagnet and Ni compounds are often
magnetic. Here we predict Ni2VAl to be a superconductor. Importantly, this provides
an experimentally testable prediction that if conﬁrmed and taken in conjunction with
the correct predictions for the related compounds, would strongly restrict the possible
role of spin-ﬂuctuations associated with Ni magnetism in the superconducting properties
of these phases.

In these compounds the presence of Nb works against magnetism associated with
Ni leading to the paramagnetic ground states of these compounds [15, 17]. The same
paramagnetic nature is recently observed in ScT2Al (T= Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au)[18].
The Ni2NbX superconductors have Tc of 2.15 K (Ni2NbAl)[15], 1.54 K (Ni2NbGa)[15]
and 2.9 K (ref.15) (3.4 K (ref.16,17)) (Ni2NbSn) with calculated electron phonon
coupling constants[15] (λep) of 0.52, 0.50 and 0.61 respectively. Electronic structures
and cohesive properties of Ni2NbAl and Ni2VAl were studied by Lin et al.[19] and a
large value of cohesive energy is observed with a pronounced hybridization between Ni-
Nb/V-Al atoms. The interaction between these atoms creates deep valleys in density
of states which separate bonding and anti-bonding region. It is this type of covalency
that works against magnetism.

In prior work [20], we have studied electronic structure of Ni2NbAl and Ni2VAl
and superconductivity of Ni2NbAl both at ambient as well as under compression and
observed a change in Fermi surface (FS) topology at a pressure of around 17 GP a
in Ni2NbAl. The change in the FS topology leads to the non-monotonic variation in
the superconducting transition temperature.
In case of Ni2VAl we did not ﬁnd any
FS topology changes in the pressure range studied. Here we focus in detail on the
superconductivity of Ni2VAl and report results on Ni2NbGa and Ni2NbSn. No other
reports are available for Ni2NbGa and Ni2NbSn regarding the electronic structure, elastic
and vibrational properties.

Superconductivity in conventional intermetallics has been traditionally discussed in
terms of the density of states at the Fermi level and the number of valence electrons per

3

atom. From the Matthias rule[21, 22], the number of valence electrons per atom should
be close to 5 or 7. Even though the Heusler superconducting compounds follow the
above prescription, the superconducting transition temperatures of these compounds are
relatively low. Among the compositional elements of the Ni2VAl, vanadium is reported
to be a superconductor with superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K[23]
and 3.6 K[24]. From previous literatures [24], the total density of states (DOS) value
of bcc Vanadium is 1.46 (states/eV/f.u.). Pressure eﬀect on the Tc has been studied
experimentally and theoretically for bcc Vanadium[23, 24, 25, 26] upto 120 GP a in which
the Tc is found to increase linearly with pressure. However, high density of states also
favours spin-ﬂuctuations, which work against electron-phonon superconductivity[27].
From our previous work the total DOS of Ni2VAl is observed to be more than the
value of vanadium and the number of electrons/atom is observed to be 7 in the present
compound obeying the Matthias rule.

We also studied the pressure dependence, as pressure provides a tuning parameter
that is very useful in understanding trends and mechanisms. Previous studies on
Hf based Heusler alloys have shown an increase in the superconducting transition
temperature with decreasing lattice parameter[28], while certain other cases show an
increase in Tc with increase in lattice constant[28]. We note that the behaviour can also
be more complex under pressure [29]. Fundamentally, superconductivity is an instability
of the Fermi surface, and so pressure induced changes in Fermi surface can lead to non-
trivial changes in superconducting properties.

Another interesting feature that connects with superconductivity is the presence of
van Hove singularities[30], in the electronic structure, leading to peaks in the density
of states as found in some of the Pd based Huesler compounds [32, 33, 31]. Interesting
behaviour might be anticipated if the Fermi level can be brought to this peak by means
of alloying. Another noteworthy point present in these compounds is the softening of
the TA2 acoustic phonon modes, which can be well correlated with the FS nesting and
the corresponding nesting vector decides the position of the Kohn anomaly present in
these compounds. Further to these, we also ﬁnd a softening in the acoustic phonons
under pressure leading to the variation in the Tc, which is discussed in detail.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Computational details are presented in
the section 2. Results and discussions of ground state, electronic structure, mechanical,
vibrational, superconducting properties and pressure eﬀect on these properties are
presented in the section 3. The conclusions are given in section 4.

2. Computational details

The Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (FP-LAPW) method as
implemented in Wien2k code [34] is used to calculate the ground state and electronic
structure of the present compounds. We adopt Generalized Gradient Approximation
(GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)[35]. The wave functions expanded up to
angular momentum l = 10 inside the muﬀen-tin spheres. The radii of muﬃn tin spheres

4

RM T were 1.78 a.u for Ni, Nb and V, 1.67 a.u for Al, 2.0 a.u for Ga and 2.3 a.u
for Sn atoms. The plane wave cut oﬀ energy is used Kmax = 9/RM T , where RM T
is the smallest radius of muﬃn tin and Kmax is the magnitude of largest plane wave
expansion. All the electronic structure calculations are performed with 44 × 44 × 44
k-mesh in the Monkhorst-Pack [36] scheme which gives 2168 k-points in the irreducible
part of the Brillouin Zone (BZ). Tetrahedron method [37] was used to integrate the
Brillouin zone. Energy convergence up to 10−5 Ry is used to get the proper convergence
of the self consistent calculation. Birch-Murnaghan [38] equation of state is used to
ﬁnd the equilibrium lattice parameter and bulk modulus by ﬁtting the total energies as
a function of primitive cell volume. We have not found any signiﬁcant change in the
electronic structure at the Fermi level with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
So, the reported calculations are without SOC.

Phonon dispersions and electron-phonon interaction calculations were performed
using the plane wave pseudopotential method (PWSCF) which is implemented in
QUANTUM ESPRESSO [39]code. The GGA-PBE exchange correlation functional is
used in the present calculations for all the compounds. The electron ion interaction is
described by using norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The maximum plane wave cut-oﬀ
energy (ecutwfc) was 90 Ry and the electronic charge density was expanded up to 360
Ry (In case of Ni2VAl it is 140 and 560 Ry). A 16 × 16 × 16 k-points grid within the
BZ is used for the phonon calculations. Gaussian broadening of 0.02 Ry and a 4 × 4 × 4
uniform grid of q-points are used for phonon calculations.

3. Results and discussions

3.1. Ground state, electronic structure properties

The ground state properties of Ni2NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) and Ni2VAl are evaluated
using the experimental lattice parameter and atomic positions[15, 16, 17, 40, 41]. The
calculated equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus values are presented in Table-I
along with the available experimental and other theoretical work and a good agreement
is seen between the present values and earlier reports. The calculated bulk moduli of
Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl compounds are nearly same and found to be slightly
high than Ni2NbSn.

We have calculated the band structure along the high symmetry directions in the
irreducible Brillouin zone with and without inclusion of SOC. From Fig.1 (given for only
Ni2NbSn) it is seen that the SOC eﬀect is very small around the Fermi level and we
have proceeded with the further calculations excluding SOC. The band structures for
all the compounds are given in Fig.2. The overall band shapes are similar for all the
compounds studied but the Fermiology is diﬀerent as seen from the band crossing at
EF . For all the compounds the lowest lying valence band arises mainly from the s-states
of X (X = Al, Ga, Sn) atom. The bands near the EF are due to the hybridization of
both Ni and Nb/V atoms. The band which cross the EF at X point in both Ni2NbAl

5

and Ni2NbGa is due to the deg states of Ni. The same band in Ni2NbSn is crossing the
EF at both X and W points. In addition to that we have an extra band at the X point
in Ni2NbSn which has Nb d character. In the case of Ni2VAl we have two bands to cross
the EF at X point.

The electronic density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig.3 along with the atom
projected DOS. Even though these compounds are composed of diﬀerent elements from
diﬀerent rows in the periodic table, the total DOS for all the compounds looks similar
reﬂecting the similar band shapes. For all the compounds we observe valleys at energies
of -6 eV , -1 eV , 0.5 eV . In the case of Ni2NbSn there is another valley at around -3
eV. This feature indicates that the interaction between the constituent atom is strong
[19]. Among all the compounds Ni2VAl has the highest value of DOS at EF with 3.51
states/eV and remaining Ni2NbX compounds have 2.27, 2.20 and 2.34 states/eV for X
= Al, Ga and Sn respectively. From the atom projected DOS we have observed that the
primary contribution to the total DOS at EF is due to Ni atom (deg states), the secondary
contribution is due to Nb/V atom (dt2g states) and the least contribution arises from X
atom (p states) (X = Al, Ga and Sn). The calculated Sommerﬁeld coeﬃcient γ is also
given in the Table-I along with the experimental values. There is a decreasing trend in
N(EF ) from Ni2VAl → Ni2NbSn → Ni2NbAl → Ni2NbGa. Experimental speciﬁc heat
can be calculated with (1 + λ) × γth. The λ in the enhancement factor is related to but
not identical to the superconducting λ and includes in addition contributions from spin
ﬂuctuations and other interactions if present. The inferred values are in the range ∼0.5-
1 for Ni2NbAl and Ni2VAl, in reasonable accord with the calculated superconducting
λ below. The values for Ni2NbGa and especially Ni2NbSn are anomalously low. The
origin of this is not clear, and warrants further investigation. Site disorder in samples is
one possibility. In any case, we also note that the N(EF ) are not high enough to place
any of the compounds near Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism.

The van Hove singularity is observed in both valence and conduction bands at the
L-point close to EF around 1 eV and -1 eV energy range. From the earlier available
reports[32, 33, 31], one saddle point is observed in Pd based compounds, at L point.
But in the case of present compounds, we have two saddle points in both valence and
conduction regions near the EF . The ﬂat bands associated with the van Hove singularity
at the L-point result in a maximum density of states.

We have also plotted the Fermi surface (FS) for the bands which are crossing EF
and are given in Fig 4. We have one FS in both Ni2NbAl and Ni2NbGa compounds
which is of electron nature due to one band crossing the EF at X point. In the case
of Ni2NbSn two bands cross EF , the blue coloured band (indicated with dotted line)
cross the EF from conduction band to valence band indicating the electron nature of the
band and the remaining red coloured band (indicated with breaking line) cross the EF
from conduction band to valence band at X point and again from valence to conduction
band at W points indicating the mixed character of the band. In a similar way, we have
two FS both having electron nature in Ni2VAl. In all the compounds we have observed
parallel sheets in FS which indicate a nesting feature.

6

Now we brieﬂy discuss the mechanical properties. The calculated elastic constants
satisfy the Born mechanical stability criteria [42] i.e. C11 > 0, C44 > 0, C11 > C12,
and C11 + 2C12 > 0 as expected.
In Table-II, we have given the single crystalline
elastic constants along with calculated Debye temperature values. The polycrystalline
elastic constants can be calculated from the single crystalline elastic constants the
relations between single and polycrystalline elastic constants can be found elsewhere
[43, 44, 45, 46]. From the same table the calculated Debye temperature (θD) values agree
well with experiments. BCS theory predicts that Tc should increase with increasing
frequency of the lattice vibrations. For some Heusler compounds [28] Tc decreases with
the increasing θD. In the case of Ni2NbX where X= Al, Ga, both Tc and θD show the
BCS theory behaviour. In the case of Ni2NbSn it is showing opposite manner. In Pd
based Huesler compounds Klimzuk et. al[28] found a decrease in Tc with increasing θD.
In their study, Tc of (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd2Sn compounds increases with N(EF ) and found the
opposite trend in case of APd2M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) compounds. Finally they
conclude that the change in Tc is dependent on the system.

3.2. Vibrational and superconducting properties

The calculated phonon dispersion curves are shown in Fig.5 along with the total and
partial phonon density of states. The primitive unit cells of the present compounds
have one formula unit with four atoms which gives 12 phonon branches including
three acoustic and nine optical branches. The absence of imaginary phonon frequencies
indicates dynamical stability at the ambient condition. The higher frequency optical
phonon modes are separated from others in Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl compounds.
But the same is not found in the case of Ni2NbSn. This separation is due to the mass
diﬀerence between diﬀerent kind of atoms in the unit cell.
In Ni2NbAl and Ni2VAl
these higher frequency optical modes are due to the lighter Al atom. In the remaining
compounds, it is due to Nb atom. Again in Ni2NbAl and Ni2VAl, acoustic and lower
frequency optical modes are due to the vibrations of Ni atoms. In all the compounds at
the zone centre, we have three optical phonon modes and in that one T2g mode is Raman
active and two T1u modes are infrared active. Frequency of these T2g mode in Ni2NbX (X
= Al, Ga, Sn) and Ni2VAl is 139.8, 148.9, 139.7 and 138.0 cm−1 respectively at Γ point.
In all the compounds we have doubly degenerate acoustic and optical modes from Γ-X
and triple degeneracy of same modes is observed along X-Γ direction. This degeneracy
is due to the symmetry of the crystal in cubic phase. In all the compounds longitudinal
acoustic mode (LA) is interacting with T2g optical modes. We have observed degenerate
transverse acoustic (TA) modes in Γ - X and Γ - L directions in all the compounds.
In other directions these TA modes become non degenerate and split into TA1 (high
frequency) and TA2 (low frequency) modes. There is an anomaly (dip) in TA2 mode
from X-Γ direction in all the compounds except Ni2NbSn. In the case of Ni2NbSn, it is
observed at X high symmetry point. As discussed below these dips are related to the
Fermi surface and reﬂect the electron phonon coupling.

7

In metals such dips can arise from Fermi surface nesting, i.e. Kohn anomalies in the
phonon spectrum. This anomaly is observed in Ni2MnGa [47, 48, 49], Ni2MnIn [50] and
Ni2MnX (X= Sn,Sb) [51]. From the phonon dispersion of the present compounds we
observed dip (softening) in the lower frequency acoustic mode (TA2) along X-Γ direction
in both Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl compounds and near the X-point in Ni2NbSn.
From the FS, we observed ﬂat portions of X- point Fermi surfaces in all the investigated
compounds to be nested with the similar portion on the other side. FS with nesting
vector direction is given in Fig.6(a). From this we observed that the nesting vector is of
length ∼0.61 of X-X distance connecting the ﬂat surfaces of FS. In the case of Ni2NbGa
and Ni2VAl it is at ∼0.64 and ∼0.67 of X-X distance. The nesting vector is around 0.7
2π
a along the Γ-X direction in Ni2NbAl. In case of Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl it is observed
at 0.68 2π
a respectively in the same direction as Ni2NbAl. The same nature is
observed in Ni2NbSn at X high symmetry point. To know the exact ’q’ vector where the
anomaly is observed, we have plotted the acoustic phonon modes form Γ to X direction
for Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl compounds as shown in Fig. 6(b,c,d), where we
observed a strong Kohn anomaly at ξ = 0.7, 0.68 and 0.62 in Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and
Ni2VAl respectively. The associated phonon branches have mainly Ni character. In the
case of Ni2MnGa, Ni2MnSn and Ni2MnSb compounds also the same type of atoms are
involved in the branches showing Kohn anomalies.

The electron phonon coupling constants (λep) were extracted from the Eliashberg
function (α2F(ω)) which can be used to determine the Tc of a conventional phonon
mediated superconductor. The calculated α2F(ω) are plotted in Fig. 7 for all the
investigated compounds. From this ﬁgure the lower energy phonon modes, which are
mainly due to Ni atom at that particular frequency are more involved in the process
of scattering the electrons in all the compounds. The Tc of the present compounds is
calculated by using Allen-Dynes [52] formula which is given in equation below,

T c =

ωln
1.2

exp(−

1.04(1 + λep)

λep − µ∗(1 + 0.62λep)

)

(1)

where ωln is logarithmically averaged phonon frequency, λep is electron phonon coupling
constant and µ∗ is Coulomb pseudopotential which is a parameter that normally takes
a value of 0.1-0.15.

The electron phonon coupling constant (λep) is usually extracted from the
Eliashberg function (α2F (ω)) which can be used to determine the Tc of a conventional
phonon mediated superconductor. α2F (ω) is

α2F (ω) =

2πN(ǫf ) Xqj

νqj
ωqj

δ(ω − ωqj)

(2)

This function is related to the phonon DOS (F (ω) = Pqj δ(ω − ωqj)) and diﬀers

from the phonon DOS by having a weight factor 1/2πN(ǫf ) inside the summation. In
the above formula N(ǫf ) is the electronic density of states at the EF and νqj is the

phonon line width which can be represented as below.

νqj = 2πωqj Xknm

where Dirac delta function express the energy conservation conditions and g is the
electron phonon matrix element. The electron phonon coupling constant (λep) can be
expressed in terms of α2F (ω) as shown below.
α2F (ω) = Z λ(ω)dω

λep = 2Z dω
where λ(ω) = 2α2F (ω)
The calculated Tc values for all the investigated compounds are given in Table-III
for µ∗ values of 0.13 and 0.15. The calculated values agree well with the experiments
with µ∗ = 0.13 for Ni2NbX (X= Al, Ga, Sn) compounds. Among the investigated
compounds, Ni2VAl is found to have relatively high Tc of 3.84 K with high λep value 0.68
with µ∗ = 0.13. As we discussed Ni2VAl has high electronic DOS and high Sommerﬁeld
coeﬃcient γ at EF compared to other compounds indicating the compound to be a
superconductor with high Tc value than the other compounds. From the calculated Tc
and λep values, the superconducting nature of the Ni2VAl compound is evident. These
calculated values are in the range of the present Ni2NbX (X= Al, Ga, Sn) and other Ni
based superconducting Heusler compound ZrNi2Ga[31].

3.3. Under compression

As mentioned, pressure is a clean tuning parameter for exploring the relationships
between superconductivity and other physical properties. This motivated us to proceed
further to see the eﬀect of pressure on the above mentioned properties for the compounds
studied. For all the compounds we compressed the volume up to -15% of the initial
volume. The pressure eﬀect on the band structure and FS of Ni2NbAl compound is
already reported in our previous work [20], where we ﬁnd an extra band to cross the
EF at the compression of V/V0=0.93 (pressure of 17 GP a) at X point and due to this
we have an extra FS at the same point having the electron character. In the case of
remaining two compounds, we have not observed any change in band structure and FS
topology under compression as mentioned above.

The electronic DOS under compression and the values are shown in Fig. 8(a). From
the plot, the total electronic DOS linearly decreases with pressure in Ni2NbGa, Ni2NbSn
and Ni2VAl compounds but in the case of Ni2NbAl it is non-linear at V/V0 = 0.93 and
is clearly represented in the inset.

We have also calculated the single crystalline elastic constants for all the compounds
under compression to check the eﬀect of pressure on the mechanical stability in the
present compounds and are plotted in Fig 8(b). From this we can observe that all the
compounds are satisfying the Born’s [42] stability criteria under compression indicating
the mechanically stable nature of the present compounds under the compression range

9

we have studied. We also observed that the values of three independent elastic constants
increases under compression in all the compounds as usual. It is also observed that C11,
C12 are more sensitive to pressure while C44 is quite insensitive to pressure for the same
compounds, where C44 is related to transverse distortion which is almost ﬂat indicating
the eﬀect of pressure on this to be weaker.

We calculated the phonon dispersion under compression. We ﬁnd hardening of
frequencies for all the modes except in the lowest frequency acoustic mode which softens
under compression in all the compounds.
In Fig 9, we have given only the lower
frequency acoustic mode under compression for all the compounds to show the softening
nature in that particular mode. From this ﬁgure, we have observed that the softening
becomes more pronounced under compression at the same ’q’ vector where the Kohn
anomaly is found in all compounds. The softening in phonon frequency, corresponding
to the Kohn anomaly, under pressure in the Nb compounds implies a pressure dependent
structural phase transition. Near the transition pressure this is presumably of charge
density wave character.
In Ni2NbAl it is observed to be imaginary at compression
V/V0= 0.92 and 0.85. In this compound, we ﬁnd an extra Fermi surface at V/V0 = 0.93.
The change in the FS topology could be reason for the imaginary mode at V/V0 = 0.92
compression. And also the nesting feature under compression becomes more prominent
due to increase in the size of the FS under compression. In the remaining compounds,
no extra FS is observed but the size of the FS increases under compression which might
lead to an increase in the eﬀect of nesting under compression. In Ni2MnSb[51] authors
observed the imaginary frequency in TA2 mode at ambient condition which is due to the
presence of Khon anomaly in this system. The imaginary frequencies under compression
in TA2 mode in all the compounds may be due to the presence of same Kohn anomaly
under compression. This acoustic mode softening is also observed in other Heusler
compounds. In HfPd2Al[53] it is observed at the pressure of 7.5 GPa, Pd2ZrAl[32] at
ambient condition. In the case of YPd2Sn[54], authors found anomaly in the transverse
acoustic mode and reported that to be the reason for the increase in electron-phonon
coupling parameter of that phonon branch. The anomaly in the transverse acoustic mode
is also observed in non Heusler compounds[55, 56, 57, 58, 59], where the authors reported
that these phonon anomalies play an important role in understanding superconductivity
in those compounds. As discussed previously, we have observed the anomalies in the
phonon frequencies at X-Γ point in Ni2NbAl, Ni2NbGa and Ni2VAl compounds and at
X point in Ni2NbSn. We already know that the lower frequency phonon modes would
contribute more to the electron phonon coupling, which further has an impact on the
Tc of that material. This indicate that the softening may lead to change in the λep and
Tc in these compounds.

We have calculated the electron-phonon coupling constant and superconducting
transition temperature for all the compounds under compression and are shown in Fig
10. From these plots, all the compounds show a non-monotonic variation in Tc and
the electron-phonon coupling constant under compression are behaving in the opposite
manner to ωln. In prior work[60, 61] it was reported that the softening of the phonon

10

DOS leads to the increase in the Tc of that material. In Ni2NbAl, the Tc plot under
compression in our previous work [20] is diﬀerent from this work. In our previous work
we used ultrasoft pseudopotentials and also we did not ﬁnd any softening nature in the
phonon dispersion curve as well as phonon density of states. In the present work we
have used norm-conserving pseudopotentials. These are more diﬃcult to converge and
require more computational resources but are more reliable.

4. Conclusions

We have studied the ground state, electronic structure, mechanical, vibrational
and superconducting properties of Ni2NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) and Ni2VAl
Heusler compounds using the density functional theory within a generalised gradient
approximation at ambient and under compression. Our calculated ground state
properties agree well with experimental and other theoretical results. From these
calculations, at the EF the contribution in DOS is mainly from Ni deg states with the
admixture of Nb/V dt2g states in all the compounds. The Fermi surface resulting from
the bands crossing the EF are also shown and observed that one electron pocket exist
in both Ni2NbAl and Ni2NbGa compounds and two FS of electron nature are found
in the case of Ni2NbSn and Ni2VAl compounds. Nesting features in FS are evident in
all the compounds. The calculated single crystalline elastic constants satisfy the Born
stability criteria indicating the mechanical stability of the investigated compounds both
at ambient and under compression. The absence of the imaginary frequencies in phonon
dispersion calculations indicate the dynamical stability of the present compounds. Kohn
anomaly is observed in TA2 mode in all the compounds which might be due to the
nesting in the FS. The computed Tc using Allen-Dynes formula agree well with the
experimental results. Importantly, Ni2VAl is predicted to be a superconductor which
have Tc value in the range of Heusler compounds. From the calculated Eliashberg
function (α2F(ω)) we have observed that Ni atom contribution is more towards Tc in all
the compounds. Under compression we have observed the change in the band structure
of Ni2NbAl compound where we ﬁnd an extra band to cross the EF . In addition we also
observed a pronounced softening in the Kohn anomalies existing in TA2 mode under
compression. This phonon softening again lead to softening in the phonon density of
states. A non-monotonic variation in the Tc under compression is notiﬁed which is
due to softening in the lower frequency acoustic mode and phonon DOS. Among the
compounds studied, we observe that the variation in Tc under pressure is minimal in
Ni2VAl. It will be of interest to experimentally search for superconductivity in Ni2VAl
and study its pressure dependence.
