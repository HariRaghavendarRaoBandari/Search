Abstract

We consider various notions of strains—quantitative measures
for the deviation of a linear transformation from an isometry. The
main approach, which is motivated by physical applications and fol-
lows the work of [1], is to select a Riemannian metric on GLn, and
use its induced geodesic distance to measure the distance of a linear
transformation from the set of isometries. We give a short geometric
derivation of the formula for the strain measure for the case where the
metric is left-GLn-invariant and right-On-invariant. We proceed to in-
vestigate alternative distance functions on GLn, and the properties of
their induced strain measures. We start by analyzing Euclidean dis-
tances, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Next, we prove that there are no
bi-invariant distances on GLn. Lastly, we investigate strain measures
induced by inverse-invariant distances.

1 Introduction

In various physical and mathematical contexts, a natural question arises:
how to quantify the distortion of an invertible linear transformation A ∈
GLn? That is, how far is A from being an isometry? In material science,

2

the local distortion of a map between two manifolds is known as a strain
measure.

One can investigate various notions of strain measures. A natural approach
is to choose a distance function d on GLn, and deﬁne the strain measure as
follows:

Strain(A) = dist(A, SOn) = inf
Q∈SOn

d(A, Q).

Since SOn is compact, the distance is realized for some Q ∈ SOn.
In material science, the conﬁguration of a body is a map f from a body
manifold B to a space manifold S. If both manifolds are endowed with
Riemannian metrics, then one can deﬁne a local strain measure at every
point p of the body manifold,

Strain(d f ) = dist(d f, SOn),

where SOn here refers to the space of pointwise orientation-preserving
isometries. By choosing orthonormal frames at both p and f (p), invertible
linear maps between tangent spaces can be identiﬁed with GLn, whence
the relevance of the proposed framework to general Riemannian settings.

The notion of strain measure depends on the choice of a distance function
d. In physical applications, one expects this distance to satisfy certain sym-
metries with respect to left- and right-multiplication—the former is related
to symmetries of the ambient space whereas the latter is related to mate-
rial symmetries. The most common symmetry assumptions are frame-
indiﬀerence, which is left-On-invariance, and material isotropy, which is
right-On-invariance.
Left- and right-On-invariance do not determine a unique distance on GLn,
nor do they determine a unique strain measure. The most common distance
d is the so-called Frobenius, or Euclidean distance,

where kAk2
given by

F

dEuc(A, B) = kA − BkF,

= tr(ATA). The Euclidean distance results in a strain measure

StrainEuc(A) = k

√ATA − IkF.

The Euclidean strain measure suﬀers from well-known drawbacks. From
a physical point of view, the main drawback is that StrainEuc(A) remains

3

ﬁnite as A tends toward singularity. The Euclidean strain “penalizes”
extreme expansions, but does not “penalize” extreme contractions.
The space GLn is a smooth submanifold of the space Mn of n × n matrices.
Thus, a natural way to deﬁne a distance d on GLn is via a Riemannian
In this context, the Euclidean distance dEuc is induced by the
metric g.
Euclidean metric on Mn,

Z (X, Y) = tr(XTY),
gEuc

where X, Y ∈ TZMn ≃ Mn

For A, B ∈ Mn, dEuc(A, B) is the length of the segment [A, B] with respect to
the metric gEuc.
A note about terminology: to avoid confusion, we will use the term “dis-
tance”, rather than “metric” in the context of a metric space. The term
“metric” will be reserved for Riemannian metrics.
From a mathematical point of view, a drawback of dEuc|GLn as a distance
function on GLn is that it is not an intrinsic distance. Since GLn is not
convex, segments [A, B], A, B ∈ GLn may not be contained in GLn.
The drawbacks of the Euclidean strain measure are at the heart of a series
of papers by Neﬀ and co-workers [2, 3, 4, 1]. They endow GLn with
a metric that possesses an additional symmetry:
in addition to the bi-
On-invariance, they assume left-GLn-invariance; this is perhaps the most
symmetric choice, as it is well-known that there are no bi-invariant metrics
on GLn. This additional symmetry restricts drastically the set of possible
metrics. The left-GLn invariance implies that the metric is fully determined
by its value at the identity. The addition of right-On-invariance yields a
family of metrics depending only on three parameters.
It was shown in [1] that the unique matrix in SOn that is the closest to
A ∈ GL+
n is its orthogonal polar factor O, where A = OP, with O ∈ SOn
and P ∈ Psymn. Moreover, a closed formula for the strain measure was
derived,
(1.1)

Strain(A) = dist(A, SOn) = k log √ATAk,

where the logarithm of a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix is its unique
symmetric logarithm, and the norm k · k depends on the three parameters
mentioned above (see (2.3) below). This strain measure diverges in singular
limits. In particular, it is inverse-invariant, i.e

Strain(A) = Strain(A−1).

4

In this paper we provide an elementary derivation of formula (1.1) for the
strain measure. Using geometric insights, the set of all possible minimizing
paths from a given A ∈ GL+
n to SOn is narrowed considerably. This helps
determining the minimal distance in an elementary way. In particular, our
analysis clariﬁes the diﬀerent roles played by the various symmetries of
the metrics.

In section 2, we introduce the family of left-GLn- right-On-invariant met-
rics. We state a key property satisﬁed by these metrics—orthogonality
relations—which play a central role in the forthcoming analysis. We also
describe the form of the geodesics. Section 3 contains the derivation of the
corresponding strain measure. In Subsection 3.4, we shed light on the rea-
sons for assuming On-invariance, rather than SOn-invariance, which might
have seemed a more natural assumption.

In Section 4, we turn to analyze extrinsic versus intrinsic distances, ﬁrst in
a general Riemannian setting and then applied to the case of GLn viewed
as a submanifold of Mn endowed with the Euclidean metric. The main
result is that while the intrinsic distance diﬀers from the extrinsic distance,
the strain measures are the same in both cases. In particular, we give a very
short derivation of Grioli’s optimality theorem [5] (see also [6]), which says
that for a given A ∈ GL+
n , its orthogonal polar factor is the closest matrix to
A in SOn with respect to the Frobenius norm.

In Section 5, we investigate how other natural symmetries on distance
functions aﬀect the strain measure. We start by showing there are no bi-
invariant distance functions on GLn, hence there is an “upper limit” to the
amount of symmetries a distance function can possess (see Subsection 5.1).

Next, we show that an inverse-invariant strain measure is obtained if
the distance/metric is inverse-invariant. We then describe two diﬀerent
techniques for obtaining such distances/metrics via symmetrization, and
analyze the resulting strain measures. In the case of symmetrizing a dis-
tance, we investigate the two families of distances considered thus far: the
Euclidean (intrinsic and extrinsic) distance, and the (intrinsic) distances in-
duced by the metrics considered in Section 2. In the case of the Euclidean
distance, the result is an improved strain measure, which penalizes expan-
sions and contractions equally. In the other cases, the strain measure is
essentially the same as without the symmetrization.

Finally, we discuss the symmetrizations of all the metrics considered in

5

Section 2. The resulting strain measure is also essentially the same as the
original. The proof contains an analysis of metrics that are expressed as
sums of two metrics, and also sheds light on the key ingredients in the
derivation of the strain measure in Subsection 3.2.

2 Symmetries and geodesics

2.1 Left-GLn- and right-On-invariant metrics

Throughout this paper, we use the following notations:
GLn is the group of n × n invertible real matrices, GL+
n and GL−n are the
connected components of GLn, i.e., GL+
n is the subgroup of n × n invertible
matrices with positive determinant, and GL−n is the subset of matrices with
negative determinant. We denote by

On = {Q ∈ GLn | QTQ = I} ⊂ GLn

the subgroup of orthogonal matrices, whereas SOn ⊂ GL+
of special orthogonal matrices, i.e those with determinant 1.
We will denote by Mn the vector space of n × n real matrices, and by
Psymn ⊂ Mn the cone of symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices.
For readability, we will try to stick to the following choice of symbols:

n is the subgroup

A, B ∈ GLn
O, U, V ∈ On
Q ∈ SOn
X, Y ∈ Mn
P ∈ Psymn.

Let g be a left-GLn- and right-On-invariant metric on GLn. A left-invariant
metric g on a Lie group G is determined by its restriction at the identity. For
A ∈ GLn, let LA : GLn → GLn denote left multiplication by A, i.e LA(B) = AB.
LA is a diﬀeomorphism and its diﬀerential (dLA)I : TIGLn → TAGLn is a
vector space isomorphism. For all X, Y ∈ TIGLn,

gI(X, Y) = gA ((dLA)IX, (dLA)IY) .

(2.1)

6

Since GLn is an open subset of Mn, its tangent space at each point is canon-
ically identiﬁed with Mn as follows: Given A ∈ GLn, the identiﬁcation
iA : Mn → TAGLn is iA(X) = [t 7→ A + tX].
The action of the diﬀerential dLA on a tangent vector at B is

(dLA)BiB(X) = (dLA)B([B + tX]) = [AB + tAX] = ιAB(AX).

Using the above identiﬁcation,

(dLA)BX = AX,

where the dependence of the right-hand side on B is implicit via the iden-
tiﬁcation of Mn with TABGLn.
Substituting this last identify for B = I into (2.1) we obtain that left-GLn-
invariance implies,

gI(X, Y) = gA(AX, AY)

∀A ∈ GLn.

Similarly, right-On-invariance implies

gA(X, Y) = gAO(XO, YO)

∀O ∈ On.

An immediate consequence of both left- and right-On-invariance, is that gI
is isotropic. For every U ∈ On:
gI(X, Y) = gUT(UTX, UTY) = gUTU(UTXU, UTYU) = gI(UTXU, UTYU). (2.2)

In fact, the same argument shows that for any Lie group G and subgroup
H ⊆ G, a left-invariant metric g is right-H-invariant if and only if ge is
invariant under conjugation with elements in H.

From a representation theorem for isotropic operators [7], it follows that
there exist constants α, β ≥ 0 and γ ≤ 0, such that

gI(X, Y) = α tr(X) tr(Y) + β tr(symX symY) + γ tr(skew X skew Y),

(2.3)

where symX and skew X denote respectively the symmetric and skew-
symmetric parts of X.
Let sym ⊂ Mn and On ⊂ Mn denote the subspaces of symmetric and anti-
symmetric matrices in Mn (cid:27) TIGLn. The following lemma asserts that these
sets are orthogonally complementary with respect to gI:

7

Lemma 2.1 Let gI satisfy the isotropy condition (2.2). Then, sym and On are
orthogonally complementary.

Proof : The orthogonality of sym and On can be shown by an explicit
substitution in the form (2.3) of the metric, hence sym ⊆ O⊥n . The fact the
these subspaces are complementary follows from a dimensional argument,

dim sym + dim On = n2 = dim TIGLn.

2.2 Geodesics

In this section we review the properties of geodesic curves in (GLn, g).

Proposition 2.1 (g-geodesics starting at the identity) Let g be left-GLn, right-
On-invariant. Let gI be given by (2.3) and denote κ = (β−γ)/2β. Let γ : I → GLn
be the g-geodesic, satisfying the initial conditions

γ(0) = I

and

˙γ(0) = X0.

Then,

γ(t) = exp((1 − κ)tX0 + κtXT

0 ) exp(κt(X0 − XT

0 )).

Proof : This was proved in [4] using an argument based on variations of
energy. A shorter alternative proof using Cartan’s moving frame method
is given in Appendix A.

Corollary 2.1 (g-geodesics) Under the same assumptions as above, let γ : I →
GLn be the g-geodesic satisfying the initial conditions

γ(0) = A

and

˙γ(0) = AX0.

Then,

γ(t) = A exp((1 − κ)tX0 + κtXT

0 ) exp(κt(X0 − XT

0 )).

Proof : This follows from the fact that left multiplication is an isometry of
(GLn, g). It is a general property of Riemannian manifolds that isometries
map geodesics into geodesics.

■
■
Corollary 2.2 Let γ : I → GLn be the g-geodesic satisfying the initial conditions

γ(0) = Q

and

˙γ(0) = QV,

where Q ∈ On and V ∈ sym. Then,

γ(t) = Q exp(tV).

3 Geodesic distance from SOn

Every Lie group endowed with a left-invariant metric is complete as a
Riemannian manifold. That is, every geodesic extends indeﬁnitely. This
follows from the fact that its isometry group acts transitively; see [8, p. 154,
Example 12]. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, [8, p. 146] the length-distance
between any two points is realized by a minimizing geodesic.

Generally, there doesn’t seem to exist any explicit expression for the (pos-
sibly many) geodesics connecting any two elements A, B ∈ GL+
n , nor for
the resulting distance between these elements. Yet, we are only interested
in the distance of an element A ∈ GL+
n from the subgroup SOn of isome-
tries. As demonstrated in [1], an explicit expression can be derived for that
distance. In this section we oﬀer a simpliﬁed derivation of that expression.

3.1 Reduction to diagonal positive-deﬁnite matrices

The ﬁrst step in calculating the distance of A ∈ GL+
n from SOn is to show
that it is suﬃcient to obtain a formula for diagonal matrices. The fol-
lowing proposition holds for any bi-SOn-invariant distance on GL+
n —not
necessarily a distance induced by a Riemannian metric.

Proposition 3.1 Let d be a bi-SOn-invariant distance on GL+
corresponding distance between sets by dist. Let A ∈ GL+
singular value decomposition (SVD) of A with U, V ∈ SOn, then

n ; we denote the
n . If A = UΣVT is a

dist(A, SOn) = dist(Σ, SOn).

Moreover, if Q is a matrix closest to Σ in SOn, then UQVT is a matrix closest to
A in SOn.

9

Proof : We ﬁrst note that for every A ∈ GL+
n , there exists an SVD such that
U, V ∈ SOn (see the comment after the proof of Corollary 3.1). Moreover,
Σ is unique (up to permutation), i.e., the singular values do not depend on
the particular decomposition.
Assuming U, V ∈ SOn and using the bi-SOn-invariance,

dist(A, SOn) = min
Q∈SOn
= min
Q∈SOn

d(A, Q) = min
Q∈SOn

d(UΣVT, Q)

d(Σ, UTQV) = dist(Σ, SOn).

(3.1)

The last equality holds since {UTQV | Q ∈ SOn} = SOn. Equation (3.1)
implies that Q ∈ SOn is a matrix closest to Σ in SOn if and only if UQVT is
a matrix closest to A in SOn.

3.2 Geodesic distance for diagonal matrices

By Proposition 3.1, we can focus our attention on ﬁnding the distance from
SOn for diagonal positive-deﬁnite matrices, Σ. Since GL+
n is complete, we
look for a minimizing geodesic from Σ to SOn. To do so, we are going to
exploit the fact that any geodesic minimizing the distance of a point to a
submanifold intersects that submanifold perpendicularly. More precisely:

Lemma 3.1 Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold. Let S ⊆ M be a submani-
fold, and let p ∈ M\ S. Assume q ∈ S is a point on S satisfying d(p, q) = dist(p, S)
(there is always such a point q if S is compact). Let α be a minimizing geodesic
connecting p and q. Then α is orthogonal to S at q.

See [9] for a proof.

Proposition 3.2 Let Σ = diag(σ1, . . . σn) be a diagonal matrix with positive en-
tries. Then,

dist(Σ, SOn) = d(Σ, I).

Moreover, I is the unique element of SOn minimizing the distance from Σ.

Proof : Let Q ∈ SOn satisfy

d(Σ, Q) = dist(Σ, SOn).

10

■
By the completeness of GL+
GL+

n from Q to Σ, i.e.,

n , there exists a minimizing geodesic α : [0, 1] →

L(α) = k ˙α(0)kQ = d(Σ, Q).

α(0) = Q, α(1) = Σ and
Lemma 3.1 implies that ˙α(0) ⊥ TQSOn.
Denoting ˙α(0) = QV (where we think of V as an element of TIGL+
(cid:27) Mn,
n
and QV is identiﬁed with d(LQ)I(V)), we obtain for any antisymmetric
matrix X ∈ On = TISOn:

gI(X, V) = gQ(QX, QV) = gQ(QX, ˙α(0)) = 0,

where the last equality is valid since d(LQ)I(TISOn) = TQSOn, hence QX =
d(LQ)I(X) ∈ TQSOn.
Thus, V ∈ TIGL+
Lemma 2.1, V ∈ sym. It follows from Corollary 2.2 that

n is orthogonal to every anti-symmetric matrix, and by

α(t) = QetV.

By the deﬁnition of α, α(1) = Σ = QeV. Since V is symmetric, eV is symmet-
ric positive-deﬁnite, hence we obtain two polar decompositions of Σ,

Σ = IΣ

and

Σ = QeV.

By the uniqueness of polar decomposition for invertible matrices, we con-
clude that Q = I, which completes the proof.

We proceed to derive an explicit formula for the distance of Σ from SOn.
Since Q = I,

eV = Σ = elog Σ,

where log Σ = diag(log σi). Since V and log Σ are symmetric, and since
the matrix exponential is injective on the space of symmetric matrices, it
follows that V = log Σ. Hence,

dist(Σ, SOn) = k ˙α(0)kI = kVkI = k log ΣkI.

Substituting the explicit form (2.3) of the metric gI,

dist(Σ, SOn) = rα(cid:16)X log σi(cid:17)2

+ βX(cid:0)log σi(cid:1)2.

As a corollary, we get that α(t) = et log Σ is the unique minimizing geodesic
connecting I to Σ.

(3.2)

11

■
3.3 Geodesic distance for arbitrary matrices

n be an arbitrary matrix. If A = UΣVT is an SVD of A, then

Let A ∈ GL+
√ATA = VΣVT, hence log √ATA = V log Σ VT. By Proposition 3.1,
dist(A, SOn) = k log ΣkI = kV log Σ VTkI = k log √ATAkI,

(3.3)

where the second equality follows from the invariance (2.2). Whenever
we write log of a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix, we refer to its unique
symmetric logarithm. Since the exponential map is a diﬀeomorphism
from symn to Psymn there is no ambiguity here. We have thus obtained
an explicit expression for the distance of any matrix A ∈ GL+
n from SOn by
elementary means.

We have shown that for a diagonal positive-deﬁnite matrix Σ, Q = I is the
unique element in SOn satisfying dist(Σ, SOn) = d(Σ, Q). By Proposition 3.1,
if A = UΣVT is an SVD of A ∈ GL+
n with U, V ∈ SOn, then UVT is the unique
matrix in SOn that is closest to A.
Moreover:

Corollary 3.1 (The orthogonal polar factor is the minimizer) Let A ∈ GL+
n . Let
A = OP be the polar decomposition of A, O ∈ SOn and P ∈ Psymn. Then O is the
matrix closest to A in SOn.

Proof : By orthogonally diagonalizing P with P = ˜UΣ ˜UT, we obtain an SVD,

A = O ˜UΣ ˜UT = UΣVT,

where U = O ˜U and V = ˜U. Note that by interchanging two columns
if necessary, we can assume ˜U ∈ SOn, hence V, U ∈ SOn. By the above
discussion, UVT = O ˜U ˜UT = O is the matrix closest to A.
Please note: the above argument shows that for A ∈ GL+
exists an SVD where both orthogonal matrices are in SOn.

n there always

3.4 On versus SOn-invariance

The analysis presented in Sections 2 and 3 assumes that the metric g is left-
GLn- and right-On invariant. Since we are interested in intrinsic distances

12

■
in GL+
n from the subgroup SOn, it may seem as if we could perform the
whole analysis in GL+
n rather than in GLn. In such case, it only makes sense
to require the Riemannian metric to be left-GL+
n and right-SOn invariant—
right On-invariance, for example, is meaningless. A natural question is
the following: would we obtain the same geodesic distances and the same
strain measures if we considered left-GL+
n and right-SOn-invariant metric
on GL+
n ?
An inner-product gI satisfying condition (2.2) is called isotropic. In con-
trast, an inner-product gI satisfying

gI(X, Y) = gI(STXS, STYS),

∀S ∈ SOn

(3.4)

is called hemitropic. If every hemitropic inner-product is isotropic, then
our entire analysis extends as is to SOn-invariant metrics on GL+
If,
n .
however, isotropy and hemitropy are not equivalent, then our analysis
has to be revisited, as the representation of the inner-product (2.3) relies
explicitly on the isotropic nature of the inner-product gI.
Our analysis relies on the speciﬁc form (2.3) of the inner-product gI in two
crucial aspects: (i) in the derivation of an explicit formula for the geodesics,
and (ii) in obtaining the orthogonality of symmetric and anti-symmetric
matrices. Since an inner-product is of the form (2.3) if and only if it is
isotropic, any hemitropic, but non-isotropic inner-product is not of that
form, hence our analysis is not applicable.

It turns out that for all dimensions n , 4, there are no hemitropic non-
isotropic inner-products. For odd n this is trivial to see since −I ∈ On \ SOn
commutes with every other matrix. The analysis for even dimensions is
less trivial. A proof can be found in [10] . Thus, our work holds as
is with isotropy replaced by hemitropy in any dimension other than 4.
Understanding the implications of an hemitropy assumption for n = 4
remains an open question.

4 Intrinsic versus extrinsic distances

Endowing GL+
n with distances induced by Riemannian metrics is one type
of choice for measuring the distortion of a linear map. Another popular
choice is the distance induced by the Frobenius inner-product on Mn, or

13

equivalently, the Euclidean metric on Mn identiﬁed with Rn2. In fact, one
of the motivations in [1] for considering distances induced by Riemannian
metrics was the claimed inadequacy of the Euclidean metric. Note that
the Euclidean metric gives rise to two distinct distances on GL+
n : (i) an
extrinsic distance, obtained by restricting the Euclidean distance function
to the subset GL+
n of Mn, and (ii) an intrinsic length-distance determined
by paths in GL+
n .
In this section we explore the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic
distances, ﬁrst in a general Riemannian context, and second, in the original
Euclidean context.

4.1 The general Riemannian case

Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold. Denote the induced Riemannian dis-
tance function by dM. Let S ⊂ M be an embedded connected submanifold.
There are two natural ways to induce a distance on S:

1. Intrinsic: Consider S as a Riemannian submanifold of M, i.e., endow
S with the pullback metric i∗g along the inclusion i : S → M. Denote
by dint

S the Riemannian distance function induced by i∗g.

2. Extrinsic: Consider S as a subspace of the metric space (M, dM). De-

note by dext

the restriction of dM to S × S.

In general, both equality and inequality may hold: For M = S2 endowed

standard Euclidean metric and S = S1, dint
To state our results we need the following classical deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 4.1 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold. A subset C of M is said to
be a geodesically convex if, given any two points in C, there is a minimizing
geodesic (in M) contained within C joining these two points.

Deﬁnition 4.2 A submanifold S of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called totally
geodesicif any geodesic on the submanifold S with its induced Riemannian metric

14

is also a geodesic on the Riemannian manifold (M, g). (This condition is equivalent
to the vanishing of the second fundamental form of S in M.)

To prove our results we shall need the following lemma which roughly says
that paths that are close to being length-minimizers are within a narrow
tubular neighborhood of a (minimizing) geodesic.

Lemma 4.1 (Nearly length-minimizing paths are close to geodesics) Let (M, g)
be a complete Riemannian manifold, and let p, q ∈ M. Then, for any ǫ > 0 there
exists a δ > 0 (possibly dependent on p and q) such that any path α joining p and
q satisfying

L(α) < d(p, q) + δ

is in an ǫ-neighborhood of a minimizing geodesic γ : I → M joining p and q. In
particular, there exists a reparametrization α ◦ ϕ : I → M of α satisfying

sup
t∈I

d(cid:0)α ◦ ϕ(t), γ(t)(cid:1) < ǫ.

In this lemma there is no submanifold, so the distance has only one possible
meaning— the Riemannian distance on M.

Proof : Assume by contradiction that the claim is false. Denote r = d(p, q).
Then, there exists an ǫ > 0 and a sequence of paths αn : I → M joining p
and q, satisfying

L(αn) ≤ d(p, q) +

1
n

,

and αn is not in an ǫ-neighborhood of any minimizing geodesic.
Since L(αn) → r, we can assume L(αn) ≤ 2r, thus Image(αn) ⊆ ¯BM(p, 2r) (the
closed ball of radius 2r around p). By the completeness of M, it follows
from the Hopf-Rinow theorem that ¯BM(p, 2r) is compact.
Reparametrize α1 by arclength, i.e assume I = [0, L(α1)], and that α1 : I → M
has a constant speed. For every n ∈ N, reparametrize αn : I → M such that
it has a constant speed cn = k ˙αnk. Then

2L(α1) ≥ 2r ≥ L(αn) = cnL(α1) ⇒ cn ≤ 2,

which implies that the αn are equicontinuous, since

d(α(t), α(s)) ≤ L(α[t,s]) ≤ 2(s − t).

15

By the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, there exists a subsequence (also denoted αn)
converging uniformly to a path α : I → M. By the lower-semicontinuity of
the length functional we deduce:

L(α) ≤ lim
n→∞

L(αn) = d(p, q).

This implies that α is a length-minimizing curve between p and q, hence
its reparametrization by arclength α ◦ ϕ is a geodesic.
Finally, the uniform convergence αn → α yields a contradiction:
exists an N such that for all n > N,

there

sup
t∈I

d(cid:0)(αn ◦ ϕ)(t), (α ◦ ϕ)(t)(cid:1) < ǫ.

We next prove the following:

Proposition 4.1 Let S be a submanifold S of a Riemannian manifold (M, g). Then:

1. If S is a geodiscally convex subset of M, then dint
S

S . The reverse
implication does not hold in general. The next assertion shows that the only
obstruction for the reverse direction to hold, is topological.

= dext

2. If S is topologically closed in M, then dint
S

geodesically convex subset of M.

= dext
S

if and only if S is a

3. If dint
S

= dext
S

then S is a totally geodesic submanifold of M. The reverse

implication does not hold in general.

4. Let p, q ∈ S. Assume there exists a unique minimizing geodesic γ : I → M

connecting p and q. If γ ∩ (M \ ¯S) , ∅ , Then dint

S (p, q) > dext

S (p, q).

The last two statements hold also if we replace the existence of a unique
geodesic with the existence of ﬁnitely many geodesics.

Proof :

1. The fact that geodesic convexity implies equality of the distances is
immediate. A counter-example for the reverse implication is M =
R2, S = R2 \ (0, 0).

16

■
2. Assume dInt
S

= dExt

S . Let p, q ∈ S. Let αn : I → S be a sequence of
paths satisfying L(αn) → d(p, q). Then, by a similar argument to the
one in the proof of Lemma 4.1, there is a subsequence αn converging
uniformly to a path α. By the lower-semicontinuity of the length,
L(α) = d(p, q), so α is minimizing, hence it is a reparametrization of a
geodesic. Closedness of S implies Image(α) ⊆ S.

3. Suppose that dint
S

= dext

length-minimizing in S, and for small enough t,

S , and let α be a geodesic in S. Then, it is locally

L(α|[0,t]) = dint

S (α(0), α(t)) = dext

S (α(0), α(t)) = dM(α(0), α(t)).

So α|[0,t] is length-minimizing path between α(0), α(t) in M with pa-
rameter proportional to arc length, hence it is a geodesic in M.
A counter-example for the reverse implication is M = S1, S = S1 \ {p}
(where p is an arbitrary point in S1). We will see another counter-
example in the next section: M = Mn and S = GL+
n .

4. By assumption, there exists t0 ∈ I such that γ(t0) ∈ M \ ¯S. Since M \ ¯S

is open, there is some open ball of dM-radius ǫ, γ(t0) ∈ Bǫ ⊂ M \ ¯S.
By Lemma 4.1, ∃δ > 0 such that if α is a path between p, q, L(α) <
dM(p, q) + δ then α is in an ǫ-neighborhood of some minimizing
geodesic joining p and q. By our assumption, there is only one mini-
mizing geodesic between p and q in M, namely γ.
Thus, there exists a reparametrization of α, α ◦ ϕ : I → M, such that
for every t,

d(cid:16)(α ◦ ϕ)(t), γ(t)(cid:17) < ǫ.

In particular, d(cid:16)(α◦ϕ)(t0), γ(t0)(cid:17) < ǫ implies that (α◦ϕ)(t0) ∈ Bǫ ⊆ M\ ¯S.
This shows that any path α which is δ-close to being a minimizer
intersect M \ ¯S. Hence dInt

S (p, q) ≥ dExt

S (p, q) + δ.

4.2 Euclidean distances in GL+
n

Next, we consider the particular case where the Riemannian manifold is the
vector space of n × n matrices endowed with the Euclidean metric. This is

17

■
the case considered classically in the context of elastic strain measures, and
whose shortcomings has motivated, in part, the consideration of alternative
measures of strain.

We start with a few deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 4.3 (Euclidean metric on Mn) We denote by (Mn, dEuc) the space of
n × n real matrices endowed with the Euclidean distance. Note that the distance
dEuc can be derived from a Riemannian metric g given by

gZ(X, Y) = tr(XTY).

Deﬁnition 4.4 (Extrinsic Metric on GL+
n , dext) the metric
space of n × n invertible matrices with positive determinant, where dext is the
restriction of dEuc, with GL+

n ) We denote by (GL+

n viewed as a subset of Rn2.

Deﬁnition 4.5 (Intrinsic Metric on GL+
n ) as an open sub-
manifold of the Riemannian manifold (Mn, g). That is, we endow GL+
n with the
pullback metric i∗g of the Euclidean metric g along the inclusion i : GL+
n →
(Mn, g). We denote by dint the distance function induced by the Riemannian
metric i∗g.

n ) Consider (GL+

n , g|GL+

We ﬁrst observe that dint > dext for some pair of matrices. Indeed, for any
X, Y ∈ Mn, the unique minimizing geodesic is the segment

[X, Y] = {X + t (Y − X) : t ∈ [0, 1]}.

Since the sub-manifold GL+
n is not convex, there exist A, B ∈ GL+
the segment [A, B] intersects GL−n . By Item 4 in Proposition 4.1,

n , such that

dext(A, B) < dint(A, B).

However, we note the following:

Lemma 4.2 Let A, B ∈ GL+
Proof : This is obvious, since [A, B] is an extrinsic length-minimizing path
which stays in the submanifold.

n , then dint(A, B) = dext(A, B).

n . If [A, B] ⊂ GL+

We next observe that both right- and left-multiplications by elements of
SOn are isometries of (GL+
n , i∗g). Hence, they are isometries of the metric

18

■
n , dint) (any Riemannian isometry is an isometry of the induced
space (GL+
distance function). It follows that dint is both left- and right-SOn invariant.
In particular, let A = UΣVT be an SVD of A ∈ GL+
dint(A, SOn) = dint(Σ, SOn),

n . By Proposition 3.1,

hence, as before, the problem of computing the distance of A ∈ GL+
n from
SOn (and ﬁnding the minimizer) can be reduced to positive-deﬁnite diag-
onal matrices Σ. We now give a short proof that I is the unique matrix
closest to Σ with respect to the extrinsic distance, that is,

dext(Σ, SOn) = dext(Σ, I) = kΣ − IkF.

Indeed, since

kA − Qk2

F = kAk2

F + kQk2

F − 2hA, QiF = kAk2

F + n − 2 tr(ATQ),

(4.1)

it follows that given A ∈ Mn, minimizing kA − Qk2
F over Q ∈ SOn is equiv-
alent to maximizing the linear functional ϕA(Q) = hA, QiF = tr(ATQ). For
diagonal and positive-deﬁnite Σ,

ϕΣ(Q) = tr(ΣTQ) =

n

Xi=1

σiQii ≤

n

Xi=1

σi = tr(ΣT) = ϕΣ(I),

where the inequality follows from the fact that Q is orthonormal, hence
|Qij| ≤ 1. The unique maximizer is Q = I, hence I is the unique matrix
closest to Σ.

Theorem 4.1 Let Σ ∈ GL+
n be a diagonal matrix with strictly positive entries on
the diagonal. Then the unique minimizer of the intrinsic distance of Σ from SOn
is I, and

dint(Σ, SOn) = dext(Σ, SOn).

Proof : Since Psymn is closed under convex combinations, it follows that
[Σ, I] ⊆ GL+
The inequality dint ≥ dext implies that

n . By Lemma 4.2, it follows that dint(Σ, I) = dext(Σ, I).

distint(Σ, SOn) ≥ distext(Σ, SOn).

19

Hence,

distext(Σ, SOn) = dext(Σ, I) = dint(Σ, I) ≥ distint(Σ, SOn) ≥ distext(Σ, SOn).

So, I is a minimizer and distint(Σ, SOn) = distext(Σ, SOn).
The uniqueness of the minimizer for distint follows from the uniqueness
of the minimizer for distext: Let Q ∈ SOn be a minimizer for the distance
distint of Σ from SOn. Then,

distext(Σ, SOn) = distint(Σ, SOn) = dint(Σ, Q) ≥ dext(Σ, Q),

hence Q is also a minimizer for distext, and by the uniqueness of the extrinsic
minimizer, Q = I.
Corollary 4.1 Let A ∈ GL+

n . Then

dint(A, SOn) = dext(A, SOn),

and the closest matrix to A in SOn with respect to both distances is the same—it
is the orthogonal polar factor of A. Moreover,

dint(A, SOn) = k

√ATA − IkF.

(4.2)

Proof : This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.1 applied to both
distances, together with Theorem 4.1. The fact that the orthogonal polar
factor is the unique minimizer follows from the same considerations as in
the proof of Corollary 3.1.

5 Additional results concerning invariant distances

5.1 Bi-invariance

As always in mathematics, the most symmetric structures are the most easy
to handle. In [1], the authors consider either left- and right-GLn-invariance
as natural requirements on a metric on GLn. Their choice is motivated by
physical considerations.

A natural question is: does there exist a distance function on GLn that is
more symmetric than the ones we have considered? In this section we

20

■
■
show here that there are no bi-invariant distance functions on GLn that are
compatible with the standard topology. (The fact there is no bi-invariant
Riemannian metric is common knowledge.)

Theorem 5.1 There is no bi-invariant distance function on GLn generating the
standard topology on GLn (the subspace topology induced by the inclusion GLn →
Rn2).

Proof : The essential point is the existence of a non-trivial conjugacy class
whose closure contains the identity. Assume, by contradiction, there is
a bi-invariant distance function d compatible with the standard topology.
Consider the following matrices:

Since d generates the standard topology on GLn, it follows that

d(D−nADn, I) = 0.

On the other hand, bi-invariance implies that for every n,

d(D−nADn, I) = d(D−nADn, D−nIDn) = d(A, I) , 0,

which is a contradiction.

As an immediate corollary we obtain the classical result:

Corollary 5.1 There is no bi-invariant Riemannian metric on GLn.

21

■
5.2 Inverse-invariance

When it comes to physical applications, a major drawback of the Euclidean
strain measure is that it does not diverge in the limit where the linear
map is singular. From a physical viewpoint, we expect a strain measure
dist(A, SOn) to diverge when A either tends to inﬁnity (expansion), or when
it tends toward singularity (contraction). The strain measure is said to be
inverse-invariant if

Strain(A) = Strain(A−1),

(5.1)

for every A ∈ GL+
n .
As noted in the Introduction, the strains obtained via the metrics consid-
ered in Section 2 are all inverse-invariant. The essential reason behind this
phenomenon, is the extreme symmetry of these metrics. Speciﬁcally, we
have the following very general assertion:

Proposition 5.1 Let G be a group and H ⊆ G a subgroup. Let d be a left-G-
right-H-invariant distance function on G. Then,

dist(g, H) = dist(g−1, H).

Moreover, if h is a closest element to g in H, then h−1 is a closest element to g−1 in
H.

Proof : Using the assumed invariances,

dist(g, H) = inf
h∈H

d(g, h) = inf
h∈H

d(e, g−1h) = inf
h∈H

d(h−1, g−1) = dist(g−1, H)

The equality d(g, h) = d(g−1, h−1) (for h ∈ H) implies the correspondence
between closest elements to g and g−1.
Note how this observation implies, without any computation, that cer-
tain strain measures are inverse-invariant (the actual form of the strain
measures is irrelevant).

Another means for obtaining inverse-invariant strain measures is to con-
sider distance functions d on GLn that are inverse-invariant, i.e.,

d(A, B) = d(A−1, B−1).

(5.2)

22

■
Indeed, the inverse-invariance of the distance implies the inverse-invariance
of the strain measure, as

dist(A, SOn) = dist(A−1, SO−1

n ) = dist(A−1, SOn).

As we will see, the requirement for inverse-invariance of the distance is far
less restrictive than left-GLn- and right On-invariance.

In a search for maximally-symmetric distance functions, we ﬁrst look for
inverse-invariant distances (or metrics) possessing additional symmetries.
In Propositions B.1–B.2 we prove that in any Lie group G, a left-invariant
metric (distance) is inverse-invariant if and only if it is bi-invariant. Since
there are no bi-invariant metrics/distances on GLn, it follows that no left-
GLn- and inverse-invariant metric/distance exists either.

In particular, it follows that the distance functions induced by the met-
rics considered in Sections 2 and 3 are not inverse-invariant. That is, the
inverse-invariance of the strain measure does not result from the inverse-
invariance of the distance, but rather from the left-GLn and right-SOn in-
variance of the metrics, as shown in Proposition 5.1 (also observed in [1,
Section 3.2 Eq. (23)]).

There is a systematic way of constructing inverse-invariant distances from
arbitrary distances. Denote the inverse automorphism by i. Since i is a
diﬀeomorphism of ﬁnite order, given any distance d on GLn, it is possible
to construct an inverse-invariant distance via symmetrization,

˜d(A, B) = d(A, B) + d(A−1, B−1).

It is easy to see that ˜d generates the same topology as d, and it is of course
inverse-invariant.

A similar construction can be carried out for Riemannian metrics on GLn.
Given any metric g, the metric g + i∗(g) is inverse-invariant, and induces
the standard topology on GLn, as does any Riemannian metric.

In the following subsections, we analyze how these two diﬀerent methods
for generating inverse-invariant distances aﬀect the strain measure. We
will see that if we start from distances/metrics having certain symmetries,
then their symmetrizations possess corresponding symmetries as well.

23

5.2.1 Inverse-invariant distances

The next lemma considers a setting that generalizes our treatment of left-
GLn- and right-On invariant distance functions.

Lemma 5.1 Let G be a group and let H ⊆ G be a subgroup. Let d be a left-G- and
right-H-invariant distance function on G. Let ˜d be its symmetrization. Then,

dist ˜d(g, H) = 2 distd(g, H).

Moreover, an element h ∈ H is a closest element in H to g with respect to d if and
only if it is a closest element with respect to ˜d.

Proof : The assumed symmetries imply d(g, h) = d(g−1, h−1) for any g ∈ G
and h ∈ H (see the proof of Proposition 5.1). Hence,

dist ˜d(g, H) = inf
h∈H
= inf
h∈H
= inf
h∈H

˜d(g, h)

d(g, h) + d(g−1, h−1)

2 d(g, h)

= 2 distd(g, H).

To prove the second part, note that for h ∈ H, ˜d(g, h) = dist ˜d(g, H) if and
only if 2 d(g, h) = 2 distd(g, H).

The above lemma implies that there is no much interest in symmetrizing
left-G- and right-H-invariant distance functions, since the symmetrizations
give rise to essentially identical notions of distance from H.

We turn to analyze symmetrization within the context of intrinsic versus
extrinsic Euclidean distances. As above, we provide a slightly more gen-
eral treatment that considers the relevant symmetries. Since this setting
possesses less symmetries than the one considered above, we will have
to use properties that are speciﬁc to the Euclidean distance; in particular,
SVD plays an important role.

Lemma 5.2 Let G be a group and let H ⊆ G be a subgroup. Let d be a bi-H-
invariant distance on G. Then, its symmetrization ˜d is also bi-H-invariant.

24

■
Proof : For every h ∈ H, x, y ∈ G,

˜d(hx, hy) = d(hx, hy) + d(x−1h−1, y−1h−1) = d(x, y) + d(x−1, y−1) = ˜d(x, y).

Right-H-invariance is proved similarly.

In our context, since both intrinsic and extrinsic Euclidean distances are
bi-SOn invariant, their symmetrizations are also bi-SOn invariant.
By Proposition 3.1, dist ˜d(A, SOn) = dist ˜d(Σ, SOn), where A = UΣVT is any
SVD of A. By the results in Section 4.2, I is the closest matrix to both Σ and
Σ−1 with respect to both intrinsic and extrinsic Euclidean distances.
Hence, for every Q ∈ SOn,

˜d(Σ, Q) = d(Σ, Q) + d(Σ−1, Q−1) ≥ d(Σ, I) + d(Σ−1, I) = ˜d(Σ, I),

from which follows that I is the matrix in SOn that is the closest to Σ with
respect to ˜d, and

dist ˜d(A, SOn) = dist ˜d(Σ, SOn) = ˜d(Σ, I) = d(Σ, I) + d(Σ−1, I)

= distd(A, SOn) + distd(A−1, SOn).

Again, we obtain that the matrix in SOn that is the closest to A is the
orthogonal polar factor of A.

The symmetrization of the Euclidean distance gives a truly diﬀerent notion
of strain measure, as it penalizes equally both expansions and contractions.
Thus, it can be considered an improved strain measure. At the same
time, it preserves the symmetries pertinent to the Euclidean metric—frame
invariance and material isotropy.

5.2.2 Inverse-invariant metrics

We now turn to the symmetrization of Riemannian metrics on GLn. Given
any metric g, the metric ˜g = g + i∗(g) is inverse-invariant. As proved in
[11], the space of inverse-invariant metrics for any Lie group is inﬁnite-
dimensional, hence, we have to address the question of ﬁnding natural
inverse-invariant metrics. We note that in general, the distance function
induced by the symmetrized metric ˜g is not the symmetrization of the dis-
tance function induced by g. Hence, the analysis of the previous subsection
is not applicable.

25

■
We start by showing that the symmetrized metric inherits some of the
symmetries of the original metric.

Lemma 5.3 Let G be a Lie group and let H ⊆ G be a subgroup. Let g be a
bi-H-invariant metric on G. Its symmetrization ˜g is also bi-H-invariant.

Proof : Let h ∈ H. Then

L∗h(g + i∗g) = L∗hg + L∗h(i∗g) = g + (i ◦ Lh)∗g.

Since i ◦ Lh = Rh−1 ◦ i,

L∗h(g + i∗g) = g + (Rh−1 ◦ i)∗g = g + i∗(R∗h−1 g) = g + i∗g.

The proof that R∗h(g + i∗g) = g + i∗g is similar.

It follows that the symmetrizations of all the metrics considered in sec-
tions 2 and 4.2 are bi-On invariant.
In the remaining part of this section we study the symmetrization of the
metrics considered in Section 2.

As mentioned above, the symmetrized metrics, unlike the original metrics,
are not left-GLn invariant, hence, our analysis of the geodesics is not appli-
cable. However, the symmetrized metrics share three important properties
with the original metrics:

1. (GL+

n , ˜g) is complete.

2. The symmetric and the skew-symmetric matrices are orthogonal with

respect to ˜gI.

3. α(t) = etV is a ˜g-geodesic for any symmetric matrix V.

We start by showing the orthogonality of symmetric and skew-symmetric
matrices. For any A ∈ symn and B ∈ On,

(i∗g)I(A, B) = gI(diI(A), diI(B)) = gI(−A,−B) = 0,

hence

˜gI(A, B) = gI(A, B) + (i∗g)I(A, B) = 0.

26

■
We proceed to prove the completeness of (GL+
n , ˜g). First note that com-
pleteness of g implies completeness of i∗g, since i : (GLn, i∗g) → (GLn, g)
is an isometry. So, it suﬃces to prove that if two Riemannian manifolds
(M, g1) and (M, g2) are complete then so is (M, g1 + g2).

Lemma 5.4 Let M be a smooth manifold, and let g1, g2 be Riemannian metrics on
M. If either (M, g1) or (M, g2) is complete, then (M, g1 + g2) is complete.

Proof : Let p, q ∈ M. For any path α from p to q,

Lg1+g2 (α) = Z pg1( ˙α(t), ˙α(t)) + g2( ˙α(t), ˙α(t))

≥ Z pg1( ˙α(t), ˙α(t))

= Lg1(α).

Similarly Lg1+g2 (α) ≥ Lg2(α). Without loss of generality, Assume that (M, g1)
is complete. For any p, q ∈ M,

dg1(p, q) = inf
α:p7→q

Lg1(α) ≤ inf
α:p7→q

Lg1+g2(α) = dg1+g2(p, q)

By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a Riemannian manifold (M, g) is complete if
and only if closed and g-bounded sets are compact. Let A ⊆ M be a closed
and (g1 + g2)-bounded set. Boundedness implies that there exists a point
p ∈ M and a number R > 0, such tha dg1+g2(a, p) ≤ R for every a ∈ A.
Since dgi(a, p) ≤ dg1+g2(a, p) ≤ R, it follows that A is also g1-bounded. Since
(M, g1) is complete, A is compact, hence g1 + g2 is complete as well.
It remains to show that α(t) = etV is a geodesic for symmetric V. We ﬁrst
note that α(t) = i(etV) = e−tV is a geodesic of i∗ g, since i : (GLn, i∗g) → (GLn, g)
is an isometry. Reversing time, we get that α(t) = etV is a geodesic of
both g and i∗g. Note that every geodesic is parametrized by a parameter
proportional to arclength, i.e., its speed k ˙α(t)k is constant. In this particular
case, the speeds are the same when measured with respect to both metrics,
since gI = (i∗g)I, hence k ˙α(0)k is independent of the metric chosen. It turns
out that in this particular situation, α is a geodesic with respect to the
metric g + i∗g.

27

■
Lemma 5.5 Let M be a smooth manifold, and let g1, g2 be Riemannian metrics
on M. Assume β(t) is a geodesic for both g1 and g2, and that its speed is the same
with respect to both metrics. Then β(t) is also a (g1 + g2)-geodesic.

Proof : The inequality: √a + b ≥ 1√2

M,

(√a + √b) implies that for any path α in

Since β is a geodesic with respect to both g1 and g2, it is locally length-
minimizing with respect to both metrics; for small enough t, Lgi(β|[0,t]) =
dgi(β(0), β(t)) = tc, for some constant c. Let α be any path connecting
β(0), β(t). By our assumption, qg1( ˙β(t), ˙β(t)) = qg2( ˙β(t), ˙β(t)) = c. Note

where the last inequality uses (5.3). Thus, β locally minimizes length with
respect to g1 + g2, hence it is a geodesic.
Next, we imitate from Section 3 the argument for ﬁnding the geodesic
distance from SOn. By Lemma 5.3, we can use Proposition 3.1 to reduce
again the question to diagonal matrices. Since the derivation of the strain
measure uses only the three properties of the metric mentioned above, it
works in exactly the same manner for the symmetrized metric.

There is just one delicacy. The proof hinges on the fact that α(t) = QetV
is a ˜g-geodesic for any symmetric V and Q ∈ SOn (note that at this stage
we don’t yet know that Q = I). From Lemma 5.5 follows that etV is a
˜g-geodesic. Since (Lemma 5.3 again) ˜g is bi-On-invariant it follows that α
is also a ˜g geodesic. Following the rest of the proof, the only diﬀerence is
at the ﬁnal stage, when evaluating the speed k ˙α(0)kI, where ˜gI-is scaled by
√2,

kVkI = pgI(V, V) + (i∗g)I(V, V) = p2 · gI(V, V).
Hence, the strain measure is multiplied by a factor of √2.

A Calculating the geodesics

A.1 Analysis of the geodesic equations

Let gI be an inner-product on Mn = TIGLn given by the form (2.3), and let
g be the Riemannian metric on GLn which is the left-translation of gI.
First, we need the following result.

Proposition A.1 For every X, Y ∈ TIGLn,
β − γ
2β

gI(X, [Y, X]) =

gI([X, XT], Y).

Proof : Note ﬁrst that

gI(X, [Y, X]) = β tr(symX sym[Y, X]) + γ tr(skew X skew[Y, X]),

gI([X, XT], Y) = β tr(sym[X, XT] symY).

and

Now,

tr(symX sym[Y, X]) =

tr([X, XT]Y) =

2β

tr((X + XT)(YX − XY + XTYT − YTXT))
gI([X, XT], Y),

and

= −

hence

tr(skew X skew[Y, X]) =

tr([X, XT]Y) = −

tr((X − XT)(YX − XY − XTYT + YTXT))

2β

gI([X, XT], Y),

gI(X, [Y, X]) =

β − γ
2β

gI([X, XT], Y).

Let {aα} be a gI-orthonormal basis for (TIGLn, g). Since g is left-invariant,
eα = d(Lg)e(aα) is an orthonormal frame for (TGLn, g). Let {ϑα} be the
orthonormal co-frame,

which implies that

ϑα|A = gA(eα|A,·) = gA(iA(Aaα),·),

ϑα|A(iA(AX)) = gI(aα, X).

The Riemannian connection is represented by an anti-symmetric matrix of
1-forms, {ωα

β}, deﬁned by

and satisfying Cartan’sﬁrststructuralequation,

∇eαeβ = ωγ

β(eα) eγ,

Noting that,

dϑα + ωα

β ∧ ϑβ = 0.

dϑα(eµ, eν) = (ϑα(eν)) eµ − (ϑα(eµ)) eν − ϑα([eµ, eν])

= δα

ν eµ − δα

µ eν − ϑα([eµ, eν]) − g(eα, [eµ, eν]),

and that

we get

g(eα, [eµ, eν]) = gI(aα, [aµ, aν]),

(A.1)

−gI(aα, [aµ, aν]) + ωα

ν(eµ) − ωα

µ(eν) = 0.

Equality (A.1) holds because Lie brackets of left-invariant vector ﬁelds
are left-invariant, together with the well-known fact that the Lie algebra

30

■
commutator of GLn is merely the standard matrix commutator in Mn, i.e
[eµ, eν](e) = [aµ, aν] [12, p. 193].
Rotating the indexes,

−gI(aµ, [aα, aν]) + ωµ
−gI(aν, [aµ, aα]) + ων

ν(eα) − ωµ
α(eµ) − ων

α(eν) = 0
µ(eα) = 0.

Adding the three equations and renaming the indexes,

2ωγ

β(eα) = gI(aα, [aγ, aβ]) + gI(aγ, [aα, aβ]) + gI(aβ, [aγ, aα]).

That is,

where

∇eαeβ = Γγ

are constant coeﬃcients.
Consider now a geodesic curve, γ : I → GLn, where

The geodesic equation for the coeﬃcients pα(t) is

˙γ(t) = pα(t) eα|γ(t).

˙pγ(t) + Γγ

αβ pα(t) pβ(t) = 0.

Exploiting the symmetries of Γ and the symmetry of the geodesic equation,

˙pγ(t) + gI(aα, [aγ, aβ]) pα(t) pβ(t) = 0.

This is a set of n2 quadratic equations with constant coeﬃcients.
Multiplying this equation by aγ, setting X(t) = pα(t)aα, which is a curve in
TIGLn,

˙X(t) + gI(X(t), [aγ, X(t)])aγ = 0,

which by Proposition A.1,

0 = ˙X + gI(X, [aγ, X])aγ = ˙X +

where

(A.2)

Equation (A.2) is an ordinary diﬀerential system in the vector space Mn.
The geodesic γ : I → GLn is related to X(t) via,

˙γ(t) = iγ(t)(γ(t), γ(t)X(t)).

(A.3)

A.2 Solution of geodesic equations

The factor (β − γ)/2β has for eﬀect to rescale time. We start by ignoring it.
Proposition A.2 The solution to

˙X = XTX − XXT

X(0) = X0,

where X : I → Mn is

X(t) = exp(t(XT

0 − X0))X0 exp(t(X0 − XT

0 )).

Proof : Clearly, the initial conditions are satisﬁed. Diﬀerentiating with
respect to t we get

˙X(t) = exp(t(XT
+ exp(t(XT
= exp(t(XT

0 − X0))(XT
0 − X0))X0(X0 − XT
0 X0 − X0XT
0 − X0))(XT
It only remains to insert exp(t(X0 − XT
0 )) exp(t(XT
in the middle term to get

0 − X0)X0 exp(t(X0 − XT
0 ))
0 ) exp(t(X0 − XT
0 ))
0 ) exp(t(X0 − XT
0 − X0)) inside the products

0 )).

˙X(t) = XT(t)X(t) − X(t)XT(t).

Please note that this exponential is the “standard” matrix exponential, i.e.,
the one obtained from integral curves of left-invariant vector ﬁelds. It is
not the exponential map of the g-geodesics.

32

■
Corollary A.1 The solution to (A.2) is

X(t) = exp(κt(XT

0 − X0))X0 exp(κt(X0 − XT

0 )).

Proposition A.3 Let γ : I → GLn be the g-geodesic,
˙γ(t) = iγ(t)(γ(t), γ(t)X(t)).

γ(0) = e

and

˙γ(0) = X0.

Then,

γ(t) = exp((1 − κ)tX0 + κtXT

B inverse-invariant metrics on Lie groups

Proposition B.1 Let G be a Lie group. A left- (or right-)invariant metric on G is
inverse-invariant if and only if it is bi-invariant.

Proof : Note that inv = Rs−1 ◦ inv◦Ls−1,

Rs−1 ◦ inv◦Ls−1(g) = Rs−1 ◦ inv(s−1g) = Rs−1(g−1s) = g−1.

By the chain rule,

(d inv)s = (dRs−1)e ◦ (d inv)e ◦ (dLs−1)s.

33

■
Since (d inv)e : TeG → TeG is the additive inverse operation (v 7→ −v),

(d inv)s = −(dRs−1)e ◦ (dLs−1)s.

It follows at once that a bi-invariant metric is inverse-invariant.

Conversely, assume the metric is both left- and inverse-invariant. Then
∀s ∈ G , (dRs)e is an isometry, hence the metric is right-invariant as well. ■
Proposition B.2 Let G be a Lie group. A left- (or right-)invariant distance
function d on G is inverse-invariant if and only if it is bi-invariant.

Proof : Assume d is left- and inverse-invariant. Since inv = Rs−1 ◦ inv◦Ls−1,
d is also right-invariant.

Conversely, assume d is bi-invariant. Then,

d(x, y) = d(1, x−1y) = d(y−1, x−1) = d(x−1, y−1).

In fact, Proposition B.2 implies Proposition B.1 by virtue of the Myers-
Steenrod theorem whereby every isometry of d is a Riemannian isometry.
