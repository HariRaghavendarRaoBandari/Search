An Application of the Nash-Moser Theorem to
the Vacuum Boundary Problem of Gaseous Stars

Tetu Makino ∗

March 8, 2016

Abstract

We have been studying spherically symmetric motions of gaseous stars
with physical vacuum boundary governed either by the Euler-Poisson
equations in the non-relativistic theory or by the Einstein-Euler equations
in the relativistic theory. The problems are to construct solutions whose
ﬁrst approximations are small time-periodic solutions to the linearized
problem at an equilibrium and to construct solutions to the Cauchy prob-
lem near an equilibrium. These problems can be solved when 1/(γ − 1)
is an integer, where γ is the adiabatic exponent of the gas near the vac-
uum, by the formulation by R. Hamilton of the Nash-Moser theorem.
We discuss on an application of the formulation by J. T. Schwartz of the
Nash-Moser theorem to the case in which 1/(γ − 1) is not an integer but
suﬃciently large.

1 Introduction

In the previous works [7], [8], [9], we investigated the time evolution of spher-
ically symmetric gaseous stars, either in the non-relativistic case governed by
the Euler-Poisson equations ([7]), or in the relativistic case governed by the
Einstein-Euler equations ([8]) or the Einstein-Euler-de Sitter equations ([9]).
Our studies suppose that the gas remains to be barotropic during the evolu-
tions. That is, the pressure P is a given ﬁxed function of the density ρ. We
were assuming

(A): P is a smooth function of ρ > 0 such that P > 0, dP/dρ > 0 for
ρ > 0 and there are constants A(> 0), γ(∈]1, 2[) and an analytic function Ω on
a neighborhood of 0 such that Ω(0) = 1 and

P = AργΩ(ργ−1)

for 0 < ρ ≪ 1.

Assuming that there is an equilibirium with a ﬁnite radius at which the
gas touches the vacuum, we investigated time-dependent solutions near this
equilibirium. The existence of solutions whose ﬁrst approximations are small
time-periodic solutions to the linearized problem at the equilibrium, and the
existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem near this equilibrium were estab-
lished by applying the Nash-Moser theorem formulated by R. Hamilton, [2].

But in order to apply this formulation of the Nash-Moser theorem, we had

to put the assumption

(B4): N is an even integer.

Here the parameter N is determined from the approximate adiabatic exponent
γ near the vacuum by

N
2

= 1 +

1

γ − 1

,

or

γ = 1 +

2

N − 2

.

Under the assumption (B4), the function (1 − x)N/2 is analytic at x = 1, and
the smoothness of this function plays an essential rˆole for the application of the
Nash-Moser(-Hamilton) theorem.

However in many physically important cases, in which, e.g., γ = 5/3, 7/5
and so on, N/2 is not an integer. Therefore the open problem to apply the
Nash-Moser theorem for the case in which N is not an even integer is very
important.

The present study is a partial answer to this open problem. In fact, when N
is very large, that is, γ − 1 is very small, the Nash-Moser theorem formulated
by J. T. Schwartz, [10], can be applied. To show this is the aim of this article.

2 Problem setting

We are going to consider the following problem.

The equations to be considered are

ﬁxed number. The unknown functions are y(t, x), v(t, x).

First we assume

(B0): N ≥ 5.
Let us denote by A(N ) the set of all smooth functions f (x) of x ∈ [0, 1[ such

that

f (x) =([x]0

as x → 0

[1 − x, (1 − x)N/2]0

as x → 1.

Here and hereafter [X]Q stands for a convergent power series of the form
ajX j, and [Z1, Z2]Q stands for a convergent double power series of the form

Xj≥Q
Xj1+j2≥Q
(N )(U p), U being a neighborhood of 0, we denote the set of all smooth
functions f (x, y1,··· , yp) of x ∈ [0, 1[, y1,··· .yp ∈ U such that there are con-
vergent power series

and

f (x, y1,··· , yp) = Φ0(x, y1,··· , yp)

for 0 < x ≪ 1

f (x, y1,··· , yp) = Φ1(1 − x, (1 − x)N/2, y1,··· , yp)

for 0 < 1 − x ≪ 1.

Using these notations we assume

(B1; N ): L0, L1 ∈ A(N ) and
L1(x) =([x]1

as x → 0

[1 − x, (1 − x)N/2]1

as x → 1

3

and there is a neighborhood U of 0 such that J ∈ A0
H2 ∈ A2

(N )(U 4).

(N )(U 2), H1 ∈ A0

(N )(U 3),

Note that, if f (x) is a function of A(N ), there is a smooth function

•

Φ ∈ C∞([0, 1] × [0, 1]) such that

0 ≤ ∀x < 1,
althogh such an analytic two variable function Φ may not exist.

f (x) = Φ(1 − x, (1 − x)N/2)

for

We suppose the following assumptions (B2), (B3; N ):

(B2): We have J(x, 0, 0)H1(x, 0, 0, 0) = 1 and there is a constant C such

that

1
C

< J(x, 0, 0) < C.

(B3; N ): We have

∂zJ ≡(N ) 0,

(∂zH1)Ly + ∂zH2 ≡(N ) 0,

∂wH2 ≡(N ) 0

as x → 1.

Here z, w stand for x

respectively, and “f ≡(N ) 0 as x → 1” is
deﬁned as that there is a convergent power series Φ(Z1, Z2, Y1,··· , Yp) such
that

, x

∂y
∂x

∂v
∂x

f (x, y1,··· , yp) = (1 − x)Φ(1 − x, (1 − x)N/2, y1,··· , yp)

for 0 < 1 − x ≪ 1.

We assume

¬(B4) : N is not an even integer.
So we consider the equations (1a)(1b) under the assumptions (B0), (B1;

N ), (B2), (B3; N ) and ¬(B4).

Note that the result of the spectral analysis of the linear operator L is the

same as the case in which N/2 is an integer. See Appendix.

Hence the problem may be settled as follows:

Fix T > 0, and functions y∗, v∗ ∈ B(N )([0, T ]; U ). Here B(N )([0, T ]; U )
stands for the set of all smooth functions u(t, x) of 0 ≤ t ≤ T, 0 ≤ x < 1, valued

4

in U , such that there are analytic functions Φ0 on [0, T ]×] − δ, δ[ and Φ1 on
[0, T ]×] − δ, δ[2 with 0 < δ ≪ 1 such that

u(t, x) = Φ0(t, x)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ T, 0 < x ≪ 1

and

.

u(t, x) = Φ1(t, 1 − x, (1 − x)N/2)

for

0 ≤ t ≤ T, 0 < 1 − x ≪ 1

Then we seek a solution (y, v) of (1a)(1b) of the form

y = y∗ + ˜y,

v = v∗ + ˜v

such that

˜y|t=0 = 0,

˜v|t=0 = 0.

(3)

(4)

Actually in the application to the problem of spherically symmetric gaseous

stars, we consider the following (y∗, v∗):

[1): To construct solutions whose ﬁrst approximations are small
time-periodic solutions of the linearized problem] Let λ be a positive
eigenvalue of L and Φ(x) be the associated eigenfunction (see Appendix); put

Y1(t, x) = sin(√λt + Θ0)Φ(x),

√λ

cos(√λt + Θ0)Φ(x),

V1(t, x) =

J(x, 0, 0)

Θ0 being a constant; let ε be small parameter; put y∗ = εY1, v∗ = εV1.

[2): To construct solutions of the Cauchy problem] Let ψ0(x) =

y|t=0, ψ1(x) = v|t=0 be the smooth initial data; put

y∗ = ψ0(x) + tJ(x, 0, 0)ψ1(x),

v∗ = ψ1(x).

3 Nash-Moser(-Schwartz) theorem

We are going to apply the following Nash-Moser(-Schwartz) theorem ([10, Chap-
ter II]):

Let J be a positive integer and Ej , j = 0, 1,··· , J, Fj, j = 1,··· , J be
Banach spaces such that Ej+1 ⊂ Ej,kukEj ≤ kukEj+1, Fj+1 ⊂ Fj,kukFj ≤
kukFj+1.
For θ ≥ 0 there is a linear operator S(θ) : E0 → EJ , so called a
smoothing operator, such that, if 0 ≤ j ≤ ¯j ≤ J, then

kS(θ)ukE¯j ≤ Cθ
k(I − S(θ))ukEj ≤ Cθj−¯jkukE¯j .

¯j−jkukEj ,

5

F is a mapping from V := {u ∈ E1 | kukE1 < 1} into F1 such that,
for 1 ≤ j ≤ J, F (V ∩ Ej ) ⊂ Fj . For any u ∈ V there is a linear operator
DF (u) : E1 → F1 such that
kDF (u)hkF1 ≤ CkhkE1
kF (u + h) − F (u) − DF (u)hkF1 ≤ Ckhk2

u ∈ V, h ∈ E1,

u, u + h ∈ V.

for

for

E1

For u ∈ V there is a linear operator I(u) : F1 → E0 such that, for

u ∈ V ∩ Ej , 1 ≤ j ≤ J, I(u)Fj ⊂ Ej−1 and

kI(u)gkE0 ≤ CkgkF1
DF (u)I(u)g = g
kI(u)F (u)kEJ−1 ≤ C(1 + kukJ)

for
u ∈ V, g ∈ FJ ,
for

u ∈ V, g ∈ F1,

for

u ∈ V ∩ EJ .

Then there is a small δ such that if kF (0)kE1 ≤ δ then there is a

solution u of the equation F (u) = 0 in V , provided that J ≥ 10.

We are going to apply this theorem to the equation F( ~w) = 0, where
F( ~w) = (F1, F2)T is the left-hand side of (1a)(1b) with y = y∗ + ˜y, v = v∗ + ˜v,
~w = (˜y, ˜v)T .

We will take the graded Banach spaces of functions ~u(t, x) of 0 ≤ t ≤ T, 0 ≤

x ≤ 1 deﬁned by the norms

k~ukEj = k~uk(2)

bE +rj,

k~ukFj = k~uk(2)

bF +rj.

Later the positive parameters bE, bF , r will be chosen suitably. Here the norms
(k · k(2)

ν )ν are deﬁned as follows:

For a function u(x) of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, we put

u[0](x) = ω(x)u(x),

u[1](x) = (1 − ω(x))u(x),

where ω ∈ C∞(R) such that ω(x) = 1 for x ≤ 1/3, 0 < ω(x) < 1 for 1/3 < x <
2/3, and ω(x) = 0 for 2/3 ≤ x.

4 Smoothing operators

We construct the smoothing operator

~S(θ)~u = (S(θ)y, S(θ)v)T
S(θ) = S[0](θ)u[0] + S[1](θ)u[1]

for ~u = (y, v),

as follows.

Let us deﬁne S[1](θ). For the simplicity, we write S = S[1],△ = △[1],
k · k = k · k[1], x instead of 1 − x, so that, △ = xD2 + (N/2)D, D = d/dx, and
u(x) be a function which vanishes for 2/3 ≤ x.
We ﬁx an extension of functions u ∈ C∞([0, T ]× [0, 1[) such that u(t, x) = 0

Proof. As [6, (B.5)] we have

Cµj ˙D2µDj.

Therefore △mF (u1,··· , up), m ≥ 1 consists of terms of the following types:

(I)

(Dα1 uβ1)··· (Dαq uβq )∂βq ··· ∂β1F
with αi ≥ 1 for ∀i, α1 + ··· + αq = m. Here ∂β = ∂/∂uβ.

(II)

( ˙Dγ1 Dα1uβ1)··· ( ˙Dγq Dαq uβq )∂βq ··· ∂β1F

with αi ≥ 1 for ∀i, γi ≥ 0 for ∀i, γ1 + ··· + γq = 2µ, α1 + ··· + αq = j,
µ + j = m.

(III)

( ˙Dγ1 Dα1 uβ1)··· ( ˙Dγq Dαq uβq )( ˙Dγq+1 uδ1)··· ( ˙Dγq+r uδr )∂δr ··· ∂δ1 ∂βq ··· ∂β1 F.
with αi ≥ 1 for ∀i ≤ q, γk ≥ 0 for ∀k ≤ q, γk ≥ 1 for ∀k ≥ q + 1,
γ1 + ··· + γq + γq+1 + ··· + γq+r = 2µ, α1 + ··· + αq = j, µ + j = m.

( ˙Dγ1 uδ1)··· ( ˙Dγr uδr )∂δr ··· ∂δ1 F

with γk ≥ 1 for ∀k ≤ r, γ1 + ··· + γr = 2m.

Then we can apply Proposition 5 to each term. (cid:4)

Now let us consider F( ~w) = (F1, F2)T .

♠ = ( ˙Dγ1 Dα1 uβ1)··· ( ˙Dγp Dαp uβp )∂βp ··· ∂β1 ((1 − ω)F2),

where F2 is a smooth function of u1,··· , up. We have to estimate kuβik[1]k.
Consider the case in which some of uβi is either y[0], Dy[0],△[0]y[0], v[0] or Dv[0].
E.g., if uβ1 = y[0], its support is included in [0, 2/3]. On the other hand the
support of (1 − ω)F2 is included in [1/3, 1]. Therefore, if χ ∈ C∞(R) satisﬁes
χ(x) = 0 for x ≤ 1/6, 0 < χ(x) < 1 for 1/6 < x < 1/3, χ(x) = 1 for
1/3 ≤ x ≤ 2/3, 0 < χ(x) < 1 for 2/3 < x < 5/6 and χ(x) = 0 for 5/6 ≤ x, we
have the equality

♠ = ( ˙Dγ1Dα1 χ(x)y[0])··· ∂β1 (1 − ω)F2

holds everywhere on 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Since the support of χ(x)y[0] is included in
[1/6, 5/6] , we see

kχ(x)y[0]k[1]k . kχ(x)y[0]k[0]k . ky[0]k[0]k ≤ kykk.

Thus we can claim

Proposition 8 Given ~g ∈ C([0, T ], X1 × X), the equation DF( ~w)~h = ~g admits
a unique solution ~h ∈ C([0, T ], X2 × X1) such that ~h|t=0 = ~0.

Proof. We can rewrite

+ a11,

Of course b1, b0 are also analytic on a neighborhood of [0, 1] × {0} × ··· . Then
we can write the equation DF( ~w)~h = ~g(= (g1, g2)T ) as

We assume that βj ∈ C([0, T ] × [0, 1]) for j = 1, 2,··· , 5.
Of course (·|·) and k · k stand for the inner product and the norm of the

Hilbert space X. We have used the following formulas:

Formula 1: If φ ∈ X2, ψ ∈ X1, α ∈ C1([0, 1]), then

(−αΛφ|ψ) = (α ˙Dφ| ˙Dψ) + ((Dα) ˇDφ|ψ).

Formula 2: If φ ∈ X2 and α ∈ C1([0, 1]), then

< H1 < M0

and

Since E is equivalent to kkk2 + k ˙Dhk2, the Gronwall argument and application
of the Kato’s theory ([3]) deduce the conclusion. Here khk should be estimated
by E as follows: The ﬁrst component of (27) implies

h(t) =Z t

kf · gk . kf ; L∞kkg; L2k

will work for s2 ≥ 0. Thus the proof for k = 0 is done.
Next consider the case k = 2m ≥ 2 with m ∈ N. We have to estimate
k△m(f · g)k. But, according to [6, (8.5)], △m(f · g) is a linear conbination of
terms

♠ = ( ˙Dℓ′

f ) · ( ˙DℓDjg)

with ℓ′ + ℓ + 2(j′ + j) = 2m. In order to estimate k♠k, we put t1 = s1 − (ℓ′ +
2j′), t2 = s2 − (ℓ + 2j). Then s1 ≥ 2m, s2 ≥ 2m, s1 + s2 ≥ sN + 2m imply
t1 ≥ 0, t2 ≥ 0, t2 + t2 ≥ sN . Therefore the inequality for k = 0 can be applied
to get

We omit the rest of the proof. (cid:4).

Let us deduce an elliptic estimate. Let n, σ ∈ N satisfy sN +2 ≤ σ, n+2 ≤ σ.
We know

The range of the summation is the same as above.

(36)

C(m + 1, u), we have

k△m[△,A]uk . C(m + 1, u).
We can estimate k ˙D△m[△,A]uk similarly, and we see

where

K(n, u) :=(C(m, u)

Let us estimate C(m, u). For example, consider
♣ = k(△γDδbi)( ˙D△ju)k,

where i = 0, 1, 2, γ +δ ≤ k +1, k +j = m. Suppose that sN +2 ≤ σ, n+2 = 2m+
2 ≤ σ. Put s1 = σ − 2− 2k, s2 = 2k. Then s1 ≥ 0, s2 ≥ 0, s1 + s2 = σ − 2 ≥ sN .
Therefore Proposition 10 can be applied to get

In this way we can verify

See [6, pp.83-84]. Keeping in mind that kuk1 . K(n, u) for n ≥ 0, we can verify

kukn+2 . kAukn + K(n, u)

by induction, using the fact K(n − 2,△u) ≤ K(n, u) and the interpolation

kukn+2 . kukn + k△ukn.

Then (39) implies

kukn+2 . kAukn + kukn+1,

provided that k~bkσ . 1. By induction, we can replace kukn+1 in the left-hand

This implies

8 Main result

Now we are ready to apply the Nash-Moser(-Schwartz) theorem to our problem.

Take 2ν = n + 1, σ = 2ν + 2 = n + 3. Then n + 2 ≤ σ is satisﬁed, and

sN + 2 ≤ σ ⇔ sN ≤ 2ν. Proposition 15 reads that
ν . 1 + k~gk(2)
ν+1,

k~hk(2)

provided that

(|k ~wk|σ+3 .)k ~wk(2)

k(1 − x)N/2k2ν+2 < ∞.
(Recall (5)(6).) Since the Nash-Moser(-Schwartz) theorem requires that

k~gk(2)

ν+3 . 1,

1 . 1,

k ~wkEj . 1,

k~gkFj < ∞ ⇒ k~hkEj−1 < ∞,

we should guarantee that ν = bE + r(j − 1) satisfy ν + 1 ≤ bF + rj and
ν + 3 ≤ bE + rj. That is, we require

bE + r(j − 1) + 1 ≤ bF + rj

and

Now (57) is satisﬁed, if we take r = 3 to ﬁx the idea. (56) reads

bE + r(j − 1) + 3 ≤ bE + rj.

(56)

(57)

bE − 2 ≤ bF

for r = 3. Recall that (23) required

So, (23) and (56) are satisﬁed if we take

bF ≤ bE − 2.

bF = bE − 2.

We should have

for j = 1,··· , 10. It holds if 2bE ≥ sN . If N > 6, then sN ≥ 4, and 2bE ≥ sN
and (22) are satisﬁed, if we take

sN ≤ 2ν = 2(bE + r(j − 1))

bE = sN − 2.

Summing up, we take

provided that N > 6.

bE = sN − 2,

bF = sN − 4,

r = 3,

Finally k(1 − x)N/2k2ν+2 < ∞ should hold for ν = bE + r(J − 1) = sN + 25,

where J = 10. This means

3N

> 2sN + 52,

(58)

which is equivalent to (24). This condition (58) is satisﬁed if N > 108.

Thus we have

9 Remark for the application to the gaseous stars

If we consider the gaseous stars governed by the Euler-Poisson equations under
the exact γ-law P = Aργ, the equilibrium governed by the Lane-Emden equa-
tion has a ﬁnite radius if and only if γ > 6/5, that is, N < 12. Therefore when
N is large, the equilibriua cannot have ﬁnite radii. But the equation of state is
not exact γ-law, equilibria can have ﬁnite radii, even if γ − 1 near the vacuum
is very small. We shall show this.

Let us consider the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation

dm

= 4πr2ρ,

du
dr

G(m + 4πr2P/c2)
r2(1 − 2Gm/c2)

where ρ and P are give functions of u. Since we deﬁne

u =Z ρ

0

dP

ρ + P/c2

when the function ρ 7→ P is given so that dP/dρ = O(ργ−1) with γ > 1, we
should put

P =Z u

0

ϕ(u′)e(u−u′)/c2

du′

when ρ = ϕ(u) is given. Here ϕ(u) is a positive smooth function of u > 0 such
that Dϕ(u) > 0 for u > 0 and ϕ(u) → 0 as u → +0. Suppose that there is a
positive smooth function ν(u) of u > 0 such that ν(u) = ν0 + [u]1 as u → +0
with a constant ν0 > 1 such that

ρ = K ∗ exphZ u

u∗

ν(u′)

u′ du′i.

It holds for ρ = ϕ(u), when ν(u) = uDϕ(u)/ϕ(u), K ∗ = ϕ(u∗), u∗ > 0 being
arbitrary. Note that if

ν(u) = ν0 =

N0
2 − 1 =

γ0 − 1

= Const.

32

for 0 < u ≪ 1, then we have ρ ∝ uν0 and P ∝ ργ0 (1 + [ργ0−1]1) as ρ → +0.
Now let us consider ρ = ρ1(u) = uν1 with a constant ν1 = 1/(γ1 − 1)
such that 1 < ν1 < 3 or 4/3 < γ1 < 2. Let (m, u) = (m1(r), u1(r)) be the
solution such that (m, u) = (0, u1c) at r = 0. Since P ∝ ργ1(1 + O(ργ1−1)) with
4/3 < γ1 < 2, [5, Theorem 1] says that this solution is short, that is, there is
a ﬁnite r1+ such that u1(r) ց 0 as r ր r1+. Hence we can ﬁnd r∗ ∈]0, r1+[
such that x1(r∗) > 1/G, where x = x1(u) is deﬁned by x = −m/ru along the
solution u = u1(r). Of course we assume that u1c is so small that dP/dρ < c2
for 0 < u < 2u1c. Moreover we can assume that r∗ is independent of large
c, for, as c → +∞, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation approaches the
Lane-Emden equation

Clearly there is a positive smooth function ˜ν(u) of u > 0 such that ˜ν(u) = ν1

Let (m, u) = (m0(r), u0(r)) be the solution for ρ = ˜ρ(u), P = ˜P (u) such that
(m, u) = (0, u1c). Since ˜ρ(u) = ρ1(u) for u ≥ u∗ and ˜P (u) = O(1), d ˜P /d˜ρ =
O(1) as c → +∞, we have d ˜P /d˜ρ < c2 and |m0(r) − m1(r)| + |u0(r) − u1(r)| =
O(1/c2) for 0 ≤ r ≤ r∗, so, x0(r∗) > 1/G provided that c is suﬃciently large.
In fact, as c → +∞, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation approaches the
generalized Lane-Emden equation

with error O(1/c2). Then by [5, p.61, Remark] we can claim that the solution
u0(r) is short, that is, there is a ﬁnite r0+ < r∗ exp[1/(Gx0(r∗) − 1)] such that
u0(r) ց 0 as r ր r0+. Since P ∝ ργ0(1 + [ργ0−1]1) with N0 arbitrarily large,
this is a desired example.

Note that (N − 1)(N − 3)/4 > 3/4 under the assumption (B0): N ≥ 5.

Therefore we have

The operator S0, D(S0) = C∞

0 (−π/2, π/2),

S0η = −d2η/dx2 + qη in L2(−π/2, π/2) has the Friedrichs extension S, a self-
adjoint operator, whose spectrum consists of simple eigenvalues λ1 < ··· < λn <
λn+1 < ··· → +∞. Thus the operator T0, D(T0) = C∞
L2(([0, 1], x3/2(1 − x)N/2−1dx) has the self-adjoint extension T with eigenvalues
(λn)n.

0 (0, 1), T0y = Ly in

Moreover we can claim

If Φ(x) is an eigenfunction of the operator T, we have

Φ(x) =(C0 + [x]1

as x → 0

C1 + [1 − x, (1 − x)N/2]1

as x → 1,

where C0, C1 are non-zero constants.
