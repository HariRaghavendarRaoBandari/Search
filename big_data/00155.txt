We study the theoretical conditions to excite a stable self-oscillation in a spin torque oscillator
with an in-plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly magnetized pinned layer in the presence
of magnetic ﬁeld pointing in an arbitrary direction. The linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation is found to be inapplicable to evaluate the threshold between the stable and self-oscillation
states because the critical current density estimated from the linearized equation is considerably
larger than that found in the numerical simulation. We derive a theoretical formula of the threshold
current density by focusing on the energy gain of the magnetization from the spin torque during
a time shorter than a precession period. A good agreement between the derived formula and the
numerical simulation is obtained. The condition to stabilize the out-of-plane self-oscillation above
the threshold is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

A spin polarized current injected into a nanostructured
ferromagnet excites spin torque through the spin-transfer
eﬀect [1–3]. The spin torque provides rich variety of mag-
netization dynamics such as switching or self-oscillation
[4–10]. In particular, a spin torque oscillator consisting of
an in-plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly
magnetized pinned layer has been an attractive research
subject in the ﬁeld of magnetism.
[11–21]. In this type
of spin torque oscillator, the spin torque forces the mag-
netization of the free layer into out of plane, and excites
a large amplitude oscillation around the perpendicular
axis. A high symmetry along the perpendicular direction
in this system makes it easy to investigate the oscillation
properties theoretically [17]. In order to observe the oscil-
lation experimentally through magnetoresistance eﬀect,
however, the symmetry breaking should occur since the
change of the relative angle between the magnetizations
of the free and pinned layers in time is necessary. The lin-
ear analysis in the presence of an in-plane anisotropy [16]
or the perturbation approach to the system additionally
having an in-plane magnetized reference layer [19] have
been made to develop practical theory.

The application of an external magnetic ﬁeld tilted
from the perpendicular axis also breaks the symmetry,
and enables us to measure the oscillation experimentally.
In other geometries, the experimental studies have shown
that the oscillation properties such as the threshold cur-
rent to excite the self-oscillation strongly depend on the
ﬁeld direction [6,10]. On the other hand, the role of the
magnetic ﬁeld on the self-oscillation properties in this
geometry has not been fully understood yet. For ex-
ample, it is still unclear how much current is necessary
to excite the out-of-plane self-oscillation in the presence
of the magnetic ﬁeld pointing in an arbitrary direction,
while it is known that inﬁnitesimal current can excite the
self-oscillation for highly symmetric case [12,17].

In this paper, we investigate theoretical conditions to

excite the self-oscillation in a spin torque oscillator with
an in-plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly
magnetized pinned layer in the presence of an external
magnetic ﬁeld. We solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) equation both numerically and analytically. The
main ﬁndings in this paper are as follows. First, we re-
veal that the linearized LLG equation is no longer useful
to evaluate the instability threshold in the present sys-
tem. The critical current density, Eq.
(9), evaluated
from the linearized LLG equation is two orders of magni-
tude larger than the instability threshold estimated from
the numerical simulation in Fig. 2. Second, we derive
the theoretical formula, Eq. (17), determining the insta-
bility threshold. The main diﬀerence between the linear
analysis, Eq. (9), and our result, Eq. (17), is that when
deriving Eq. (9), a periodic precession around the stable
state is assumed in the linear analysis, while in deriving
Eq. (17), we focus on the transition of the magnetization
from the stable state to the out-of-plane self-oscillation
state during a time shorter than the precession period.
A good agreement between the numerical simulation and
our formula, Eq. (17), is obtained, as shown in Fig. 5.
Third, we derive theoretical conditions to guarantee the
present results. Equation (21) is the condition that our
formula of the threshold current density, Eq. (17), works
better than the linear analysis to estimate the instability
threshold. Equation (23) is the condition to stabilize the
out-of-plane self-oscillation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we show
the numerical simulation results near the instability of
the initial state. We also solve the linearized LLG equa-
tion analytically.
III, we derive a theoretical
formula of the threshold current, and conﬁrm its validity
by comparing the results obtained from the formula with
the numerical simulation. The conclusion is summarized
in Sec. IV.

II. NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND LINEAR

ANALYSIS

In this section, we investigate the threshold current
density which is necessary to destabilize the magnetiza-
tion in the stable state by numerically solving the LLG
equation. We also compare the numerical result with the
analytical values of the critical current density jc esti-
mated from the linearized LLG equation. Throughout
this paper, the term ”threshold current” indicates the
current destabilizing the stable state calculated in the
numerical simulation or from the formula which is also
well consistent with the numerical simulation, while the
term ”critical current” is a current estimated from the
linearized LLG equation.

A. System description

The system we consider is schematically shown in Fig.
1(a). The z axis is perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane. The
unit vectors pointing in the magnetization direction of
the free and pinned layers are denoted as m and p, re-
spectively. The magnetization of the pinned layer points
to the positive z direction, p = +ez. The positive cur-
rent is deﬁned as the electrons ﬂowing from the free layer
to the pinned layer. We use the macrospin approxima-
tion to the free layer. The magnetization dynamics is
described by the LLG equation

dm
dt

= −γm × H − γHsm × (p × m) + αm ×

dm
dt

, (1)

where γ and α are the gyromagnetic ratio and the Gilbert
damping constant, respectively. We use the approxima-
tion 1 + α2 ≃ 1 because the damping constant for typical
ferromagnets is on the order of 10−2 − 10−3 [22,23]. The
spin torque strength is

Hs =

ηj

2eM d

,

(2)

where η is the spin polarization of the electric current
density j, while M and d are the saturation magnetiza-
tion and the thickness of the free layer, respectively. We
neglect the asymmetry of the spin torque described by
the term 1/(1 + λm· p) [1] here, for simplicity. The criti-
cal current density in the presence of this factor, as well as
its role, is brieﬂy summarized in Appendix A. The mag-
netic ﬁeld H consists of the demagnetization ﬁeld along
the z direction, −4πM , and the applied Happl expressed
as

H = Happl − 4πM mzez.

(3)

The applied ﬁeld, Happl, is tilted from the z axis and
assume to lie in xz plane for convention, i.e.,

Happl = Happl sin θHex + Happl cos θHez,

(4)

where Happl and θH are the amplitude and the tilted
angle from the z axis of the applied ﬁeld, respectively.
The magnetic ﬁeld relates to the energy density E via

E = −MR dm · H, which in the present system is
E = − M Happl (sin θH mx + cos θH mz) + 2πM 2m2
Here, we assume that Happl < 4πM , and therefore, the
stable state, i.e., the minimum of Eq. (5), locates close
to the x axis. Note that the magnetization dynamics
described by Eq. (1) can be regarded as the motion of a
point particle on an unit sphere.

z. (5)

The values of the parameters used in this section
are brought from typical experiments [24], M = 1300
emu/c.c., γ = 1.764 × 107 rad/(Oe s), α = 0.01, d = 2
nm, and η = 0.5. The magnitude of the applied ﬁeld is
Happl = 650 Oe, while the ﬁeld angle is θH = 5◦. Fig-
ure 1(b) shows the constant energy curves of Eq.
(5)
with these parameters. Note that the stable (minimum
energy) state, the saddle point, and the unstable (local
maximum) states of the energy density E all exist in
the xz plane. The stable state locates in the positive x
region, while the saddle point exists in the negative x
region. Also, the unstable states slightly shift from the

z axis due to the applied ﬁeld. We denote the energies
corresponding to the stable state, the saddle point, and
the unstable states as Emin, Esaddle, and Emax±, where
the subscript ± distinguishes the unstable states in the
positive (+) and negative (−) z region. For θH 6= 90◦,
Emax+ 6= Emax−. The constant energy curves in Fig.
1(b) are classiﬁed to the ellipses around the x and z axes.
The energy density E corresponding to the curves around
the x axis is in the region of Emin ≤ E ≤ Esaddle, while
that for the curves around the z axis is in the region of
Esaddle < E ≤ Emax±.

B. Linear analysis

The conventional method to estimate the minimum
current density to destabilize the stable state is lineariz-
ing the LLG equation, and investigate the oscillating so-
lution of the magnetization with a complex frequency
[25–27]. In this section, we derive the theoretical formula
of the critical current density, and estimate its value.

We introduce the zenith and azimuth angles (θ, ϕ) as
m = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ) to identify the magne-
tization direction. In particular, the angles correspond-
ing to the stable state are denoted as (θ0, ϕ0).
In the
present case, ϕ0 = 0, and θ0 is determined by the condi-
tion (∂E/∂θ)ϕ=ϕ0 = 0,

Happl sin(θH − θ0) + 4πM sin θ0 cos θ0 = 0.

(6)

We introduce a new coordinate XY Z where the Z
axis is parallel to the magnetization in the stable state
(θ0, ϕ0). A small amplitude oscillation of the magneti-
zation around the Z axis is described by the following
linearized LLG equation (the detail of the derivation is
shown in Appendix A)

with HX = Happl cos(θH − θ0) − 4πM cos 2θ0 and HY =

Eq. (7) has a form of exp{γ[±ipdet[M] − (Tr[M/2])2 −
Tr[M]/2]t}. The critical current density is deﬁned as the
current density satisfying Re[±ipdet[M] − (Tr[M/2])2 −
Tr[M]/2] = 0. For a small α, this condition is approx-
imated to Tr[M/2] = 0 because (Tr[M/2])2/det[M] ∼
α2 ≃ 0. Therefore, the critical current density becomes

Substituting the above parameters, we ﬁnd that θ0 ≃
87.7◦ and jc = 328 × 106A/cm2.

FIG. 2: The trajectories of the magnetization dynamics on
the unit spheres. The time evolutions of the magnetization
components are also shown. The values of the current density
j are (a) 7.2, (b) 7.3, (c) -7.2, and (d) -7.3 ×106 A/cm2.

C. Numerical simulation

Figures 2(a)-(d) show the magnetization dynamics on
the unit sphere and time developments of the components
of m, obtained by numerically solving the LLG equation,
Eq. (1). The current density is (a) 7.2, (b) 7.3, (c) -7.2,
and (d) -7.3 ×106 A/cm2. As shown, when the current
magnitude |j| is smaller than 7.2 × 106 A/cm2, the mag-
netization ﬁnally moves to another point and stops its
dynamics. On the other hand, the magnetization shows
the self-oscillation for |j| ≥ 7.3 × 106A/cm2. The z
component of the magnetization moves to the positive
(negative) z direction for the negative (positive) current
because the negative (positive) current prefers m to be
parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetization of the pinned
layer, p = +ez.

Three important conclusions are obtained from Fig.
2. First, the threshold current density to destabilize the
initial stable state, ≃ ±7.3 × 106 A/cm2, is two orders
of magnitude smaller than the critical current density,
jc = 328 × 106 A/cm2, estimated from the linearized
LLG equation. Second, both positive and negative cur-
(cid:21) .
rents can destabilize the initial state, while the sign of jc
is ﬁxed (positive for θH < 90◦). Third, the magnetization
precesses around the z axis above the threshold. Note
that the self-oscillation occurs on the trajectory close to
the constant energy curve. Although the energy land-

scape has the constant energy curves around the x axis,
as shown in Fig. 1(b), an in-plane precession around the
x axis does not appear. In the next section, we explain
the physical meanings of such behavior.

III. THEORETICAL FORMULA OF

THRESHOLD CURRENT

The results discussed in the previous section indicates
that the linear analysis is no longer applicable to evalu-
ate the instability threshold, although the linear analysis
has been widely used to analyze the spin torque induced
magnetization dynamics [25–27]. In this section, we clar-
ify the reason for the breakdown of the linear analysis,
and derive a theoretical formula of the threshold current
density by focusing on the energy gain of the free layer
generated from the work done by spin torque.

A. LLG equation averaged over constant energy

curves

Here, let us discuss the averaging technique of the LLG
equation on the constant energy curves. This method has
been used in several works to analyze the self-oscillation
and the thermally activated magnetization switching in-
duced by spin torque [28–40]. As will be discussed be-
low, the critical current density jc introduced above cor-
responds to a special limit of this averaging technique.
Therefore, by reviewing the derivation of the averaged
LLG equation, the reason why the linearized LLG equa-
tion does not work to estimate the instability condition
accurately will be clariﬁed.

The self-oscillation is a steady precession on a constant
energy curve of E excited by the magnetic ﬁeld torque
(−γm× H). To maintain the precession, the spin torque
should balance with the damping torque. Note however
that the spin torque and the damping torque have diﬀer-
ent angular dependences. Therefore, strictly speaking,
the spin torque may overcome the damping torque at
certain points on the precession trajectory, the damping
torque may however overcome the spin torque at other
points. The self-oscillation is maintained when the shift
from the constant energy curve due to the imbalance be-
tween the spin torque and the damping torque is suﬃ-
ciently small. In that case, the magnetization can return
back to the original constant energy curve during the pre-
cession. When this condition is satisﬁed, we obtain the
following averaged LLG equation,

I dt

= Ws(E) + Wα(E),

(10)

where the integral range is a precession period on a con-
stant energy curve of E. The work done by spin torque
and the dissipation due to the damping during the pre-

state, the self-oscillation is described by the equation

Since

the

essary to excite a self-oscillation on a certain constant
energy curve of E is

j(E) =

2αeM d

η

H dt[H2 − (m · H)2]

H dt[p · H − (m · p)(m · H)]

.

(13)

The explicit form of j(E) for an arbitrary E is obtained,
in principle, by substituting the solution of the precession
trajectory on a constant energy curve, which is described
by dm/dt = −γm × H. However, the solution is hardly
obtained because the equation is a nonlinear equation.
Therefore, we evaluate the integrals in Eq. (13) numer-
ically, except for special cases mentioned below. The
technique to evaluate the integrals in Eq. (13) is shown,
for example, in Ref. [38].

B. Derivation of threshold current

Note that the critical current density jc, Eq. (9), ob-
tained from the linearized LLG equation relates to Eq.
(13) via

jc = lim

E→Emin

j(E).

(14)

Therefore, the fact that the critical current density jc
is quite larger than the threshold current density found

in the numerical simulation indicates the breakdown of
applying averaged LLG equation.

An important assumption in the averaged LLG equa-
tion is that the magnitudes of the spin torque and the
damping torque are suﬃciently small. Thus, a shift of the
magnetization from a constant energy curve due to the
imbalance between these torques is also small. However,
this assumption is not satisﬁed in the present case. Fig-
ure 3 shows the trajectory of the magnetization dynamics
obtained from the numerical simulation, where the cur-
rent density j = −7.3× 106 A/cm2 is the threshold value
found in Fig. 2(d). We also show the constant energy
curve including the saddle point md. We should remind
the readers that there are two kinds of constant energy
curves, as shown in Fig. 1(b), i.e., the curves around
the x axis corresponding to Emin ≤ E ≤ Esaddle and the
curves around the z axis corresponding to Esaddle < E ≤
Emax±. The constant energy curve of Esaddle separates
these in-plane and out-of-plane regions. As shown in Fig.
3, while the magnetization moves from the initial state
to a point close to the saddle point, the magnetization
crosses the constant energy curves of Esaddle, and trans-
fers from the in-plane region to the out-of-plane region.
A periodic oscillation around the stable state (x axis)
is not excited. This result is the evidence that the as-
sumption used in Eq. (13), as well as Eq. (9), is broken.
Therefore, the critical current density jc does not work
to estimate the instability of the magnetization around
the stable state accurately.

Figure 3 suggests that the magnetization can climb up
the energy barrier Esaddle − Emin by absorbing energy
due to the work done by the spin torque during a time
shorter than a precession period around the stable state.
Therefore, the threshold current density can be deﬁned
as a current density satisfying the following equation,

Z md

mmin

dt

dE
dt

= Esaddle − Emin,

(15)

where mmin corresponds to the initial stable state.
Strictly speaking, the exact solution of the LLG equa-
tion is necessary to evaluate the threshold current density
from Eq. (15). However, the LLG equation is a nonlinear
equation, and it is diﬃcult to obtain the exact solution.
Instead, we approximate Eq. (15) as

Z md

md±

dt

dE
dt ≃ Esaddle − Emin,

(16)

where md± are the points on the constant energy curve
of Esaddle and are located in the xz plane; see Fig. 3.
We note that Eq.
(15) is well approximated by Eq.
(16) when md± locate close to mmin, which means that
Happl/(4πM ) ≪ 1. Note that the left hand side of Eq.
(16) can be evaluated in a similarly to the manner cal-
culating Eq. (13) because the integral range is on the
constant energy curve. However, the integral range is
limited to [md±, md] in Eq. (16), while the range is over
a periodic precession in Eq. (13). The values of the inte-
grals for these diﬀerent regions are, in general, diﬀerent.

5

Since the value of the integral in Eq. (16) is determined
by the energy landscape, and the time-dependent solu-
tion of Eq. (1) is unnecessary, the integral in Eq. (16) is
easily evaluated than that in Eq. (15) [31].

The current density satisfying Eq. (16) is given by

(17)

Equation (17) is the theoretical formula of the thresh-
old current density, and is the main result in this paper.
This equation provides the estimation of the threshold
current density with high accuracy. For example, the
values of jth± with the parameters used in Fig. 2 are
jth+ = −7.7 × 106A/cm2 and jth− = 7.6 × 106A/cm2,
which show good agreement with the numerical results
in Fig. 2. These values are estimated for θH = 5◦. Below,
we show that the agreement between Eq. (17) and the
numerical simulation is obtained even for diﬀerent values
of θH ; see Fig. 5. Note that |jth+| 6= |jth−| because the
magnetic ﬁeld pointing in the positive z direction breaks
the symmetry between the magnetization dynamics mov-
ing to the positive and negative z directions, although the
diﬀerence is small. We emphasize that Eq. (17) consists
of two parts. One is proportional to α because this term
arises from the energy dissipation due to the damping.
The other is, on the other hand, independent of α but
proportional to the energy barrier Esaddle − Emin.
Equation (17) can be simpliﬁed into a diﬀerent form
for θH = 90◦. In this case, Esaddle = M Happl, Emin =
d±, 0, zd±) with zd± =

−M Happl, and md± = (q1 − z2

Note that jth± → 0 in the limit of h = Happl/(4πM ) → 0,
indicating that inﬁnitesimal current can destabilize the
stable state in the absence of the applied ﬁeld.

We note that both the positive and negative currents
can destabilize the stable state in our picture, contrary to
jc having a ﬁxed sign (positive for θH < 90◦). The phys-
ical meaning of this diﬀerence is as follows. Since the

damping torque always dissipates energy from the free
layer, positive energy should be supplied from the work
done by spin torque to destabilize the stable state.
In
the derivation of jc, a steady precession around the sta-
ble state is assumed. On the precession trajectory, the
spin torque has a component antiparallel to the damping
torque when mz . 0 and has a component parallel to
the damping torque when mz & 0, for a positive current.
The spin torque supplies energy to the free layer in the
former case, but dissipates energy from the free layer in
the latter case. Note that the trajectory slightly shifts
to the positive direction due to the magnetic ﬁeld hav-
ing the positive z component, i.e., the trajectory is not
symmetric with respect to the xy plane. Then, the work
done by spin torque during the precession becomes ﬁnite
and positive. The spin torque overcomes the damping
torque when the current density becomes larger than jc.
When the current direction is reversed, the work done by
spin torque becomes negative, and thus, the spin torque
cannot overcome the damping. As a result, the sign of
jc is positive. However, as emphasized above, a periodic
precession around the easy axis assumed in the deriva-
tion of jc is not excited in the present case.
Instead,
we focused on the magnetization dynamics from md± to
md. The work done by spin torque during [md−, md]
becomes positive when the current has the positive sign.
Similarly, the work during [md+, md] is positive when the
current sign is negative. Therefore, both the positive and
negative currents can destabilize the stable state by com-
pensating the damping torque. Note also that the mag-
netization crosses the constant energy curve of Esaddle
during a time shorter than a precession period around
the x axis. Therefore, an in-plane self-oscillation on a
constant energy curve of Emin ≤ E ≤ Esaddle around the
x axis cannot be excited.

C. Applicability of the linear analysis and

averaging method of the LLG equation

There are two characteristic current scales, jc and
jth±, related to the magnetization dynamics, as discussed
above. These two currents are deﬁned from diﬀerent
mechanisms of the instability of the stable state. The in-
stability condition of a precession around the stable state
gives jc. On the other hand, jth± was derived by the con-
dition that the energy gain by the spin torque during a
time shorter than the precession period becomes larger
than the energy barrier between the stable state and
the saddle point. The initial state is destabilized when
the current magnitude becomes larger than min[jc, jth±].
For the present parameters, jth± is smaller than jc, and
therefore, jth± determines the instability threshold. The
condition that jth± works well to estimate the instability
of the stable state can be expressed as

jth±
jc

< 1.

(21)

6

This is another important equation in this paper, guar-
anteeing the validity of our approach. Whether Eq. (21)
is satisﬁed or not depends on the material parameters,
as well as the applied ﬁeld magnitude and angle.

Note that the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq.
(17) is proportional to the damping constant α, while
the second term is independent of α. On the other hand,
Eq. (9) is proportional to α. Therefore, Eq. (21) is not
satisﬁed when α becomes suﬃciently small. When Eq.
(21) is unsatisﬁed, jc determines the instability of the
stable state. Then, we can discuss the minimum value
of α guaranteeing the applicability of Eq. (21) [37]. The
value α which falls oﬀ from the condition in Eq. (21)
for the parameters used in Fig. 2 is α < 1.7 × 10−4.
This value of α is at least one to two orders of magni-
tude smaller than the experimentally reported values for
conventional ferromagnets used in spin torque oscillator,
such as CoFeB [22,23]. Therefore, we consider that jth±
determines the instability of the stable state for typical
experiments.

We brieﬂy discuss the role of the angular dependence of
the spin torque characterized by the term 1/(1+λm·p) on
the instability threshold, although this term is neglected
in the above calculation, for simplicity. When the applied
ﬁeld points to the in-plane direction, θH = 90◦, the stable
state corresponds to θ0 = 90◦, and the critical current
density in Eq. (9) diverges. This is because the work
done by spin torque during the precession around the
stable state becomes zero. Therefore, Eq. (21) is always
satisﬁed for θH = 90◦. On the other hand, when the
angular dependence of the spin torque characterized by
the term 1/(1 + λm · p) is taken into account, Eq. (9)
becomes

jc(θH = 90◦) =

4αeM d

ηλ

(Happl + 2πM ) ,

(22)

see Appendix A. When Eq. (22) becomes smaller than
Eq. (20), Eq. (21) is not satisﬁed, and the instability
threshold is determined by jc. We emphasize, however,
that the critical current density in the presence of ﬁnite
λ diverges at diﬀerent ﬁeld angle θH 6= 90◦. At this ﬁeld
angle, Eq. (21) is satisﬁed, and Eq. (17) determines the
instability threshold; see Appendix A.

D. Validity of Eq. (17) and condition to excite

out-of-plane self-oscillation

In this section, we conﬁrm the validity of Eq.

(17)
for a wide range of θH by comparing with the numerical
simulation of the LLG equation.

Before the comparison, we brieﬂy discuss the deﬁni-
tion of the threshold current density estimated from the
numerical simulation. We emphasize that jth± just de-
termines the instability of the stable state, and does
not guarantee the existence of the out-of-plane self-
oscillation. The out-of-plane self-oscillation is excited

when a condition,

j(E)
jth±

> 1,

(23)

is satisﬁed [39], where the range of E is Esaddle < E ≤
Emax±. Note that the reason why the out-of-plane self-
oscillations appear in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d) is that there
exists a certain E satisfying Eq.
(23). On the other
hand, when Eq. (23) is not satisﬁed for any value of E,
the magnetization moves to the point close to −(+)ez for
a positive (negative) current above jth± because the spin
torque magnitude becomes suﬃciently strong, and the
magnetization eventually becomes parallel or antiparal-
lel to the magnetization of the pinned layer, p = +ez.
Figure 4 shows an example of such dynamics, where
θH = 20◦ and the current density is close to the thresh-
old value, −27.3× 106A/cm2, for this θH . As shown, the
magnetization ﬁnally becomes almost parallel to the z
axis. The threshold current density evaluated from the
numerical simulation should be deﬁned as the current
density above which the magnetization shows a stable
out-of-plane self-oscillation or the magnetization moves
to the points close to ±ez. The detail of the method nu-
merically deﬁning the threshold current density is sum-
marized in Appendix B.

The threshold current density estimated from the nu-
merical simulation of the LLG equation is shown by the
solid lines in Fig. 5. The magnetic ﬁeld angle θH varies
in the range of 0 < θH ≤ 90◦. We also shows the value
of jth± evaluated from Eq. (17) by dots. We ﬁnd a good
agreement between the numerical and theoretical results,
guaranteeing the validity of Eq. (17).

We notice that j(E) is an increasing function of E for
the out-of-plane self-oscillation, as in the zero ﬁeld case
[12,17]. Then, there is a certain E satisfying Eq. (23) if

ju±

is satisﬁed, where ju± are Eq. (13) at the unstable states,

Figure 6 shows the dependences of jth± and ju± on
the ﬁeld angle θH, where Happl = 650Oe.
It is shown
that ju± is almost independent of θH , while jth± in-
creases with increasing θH . We ﬁnd that ju±/jth± > 1

with the numerical results shown in Figs.

guaranteeing the validity of our argument. We notice

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we studied the theoretical conditions to
excite the self-oscillation in a spin torque oscillator con-
sisting of an in-plane magnetized free layer and a perpen-
dicularly magnetized pinned layer in the presence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld pointing in an arbitrary direction.
The numerical simulation showed that the initial stable
state is destabilized by current density much smaller than
the critical current density estimated from the linearized
LLG equation. The fact implies that the linearized LLG
equation is no longer applicable to evaluate the instabil-
ity threshold in the present system. Then, we derived the
theoretical formula of the threshold current density, Eq.
(17), by focusing on the transition of the magnetization
from the stable state to the out-of-plane precession dur-
ing a time shorter than a precession period around the
stable state. The derived formula consists of two parts,
where one is proportional to the damping constant α,
while the other is independent of α but proportional to
the energy barrier Esaddle − Emin for the transition. A
good agreement between the numerical simulation and
our formula, Eq. (17), is obtained, indicating the validity
of the formula. We also derived the theoretical condition,
Eq. (23), to stabilize the out-of-plane self-oscillation.

Appendix A: Derivation of linearized LLG equation

In this Appendix, we show the detail of the derivation
of Eq.
(7). For generality, we consider a ferromagnet
having uniaxial anisotropies along the x, y, and z axes
with an external magnetic ﬁeld applied in an arbitrary
direction. The magnetic ﬁeld is given by

Happl sin θH cos ϕH − 4πM ˜Nxmx
H =
Happl sin θH sin ϕH − 4πM ˜Nymy


Happl cos θH − 4πM ˜Nzmz


 .

(A1)

The generalized demagnetization coeﬃcient ˜Ni (i =
x, y, z) is deﬁned as 4πM ˜Ni = 4πM Ni − HKi, where
4πM Ni is the shape anisotropy (demagnetization) ﬁeld
with Nx + Ny + Nz = 1, while HKi is the crystalline
or interface anisotropy ﬁeld. The energy density E =

−MR dm · H is

= − Happl [sin θH sin θ cos(ϕH − ϕ) + cos θH cos θ]
+ 2πM ˜Nx sin2 θ cos2 ϕ + 2πM ˜Ny sin2 θ sin2 ϕ
+ 2πM ˜Nz cos2 θ.

(A2)

The system in the main text corresponds to the case of
˜Nx = ˜Ny = 0, ˜Nz = 1, and ϕH = 0.

Since we are interested in a small oscillation of the
magnetization around the stable state, the zenith and
azimuth angles corresponding to the stable state should
be identiﬁed. The stable state is determined by the con-
ditions that ∂E/∂θ = ∂E/∂ϕ = 0, which are explicitly
given by

Happl [sin θH cos θ cos(ϕH − ϕ) − cos θH sin θ]
− 4πM ˜Nx sin θ cos θ cos2 ϕ − 4πM ˜Ny sin θ cos θ sin2 ϕ
+ 4πM ˜Nz sin θ cos θ = 0,

(A3)

Happl sin θH sin θ sin(ϕH − ϕ)
+ 4πM ˜Nx sin2 θ sin ϕ cos ϕ − 4πM ˜Ny sin2 θ sin ϕ cos ϕ = 0.

(A4)

Let us denote the zenith and azimuth angles satisfying
Eqs.
(A3) and (A4) as (θ0, ϕ0). As mentioned in the
main text, we introduce the XY Z coordinate where the
Z axis is parallel to the stable state (θ0, ϕ0). The rotation
to the xyz coordinate to the XY Z coordinate is described
by the rotation matrix

Now we consider a small oscillation of the magnetiza-
tion around the stable state. Using the approximations
mZ ≃ 1 and |mX|,|mY | ≪ 1, the LLG equation is lin-
earized as

Substituting ˜Nx = ˜Ny = 0, ˜Nz = 1, ϕH = 0, and θp = 0,
Eq. (A15) reproduces Eq. (9). On the other hand, in the
case of the in-plane magnetized system considered in Ref.
[26], i.e., 4πM ˜Nx = −HK, ˜Ny = 0, ˜Nz = 1, θH = 90◦,
ϕH = 0, θp = 90◦, and ϕp = 0, we ﬁnd that HXX =
−4πM , HY Y = 0, and HZZ = Happl + HK, where HK is
the in-plane anisotropy. Then, the critical current den-
sity becomes jc = [2αeM d/(η)](Happl + HK + 2πM ),
which is consistent with the result in Ref. [26].

The angular dependence of the spin torque, charac-
terized by the factor 1/(1 + λm · p), can be taken into
account as follows. In this case, Eq. (2) is replaced by

where P (θ0) is given by

P (θ0) = cos θ0 +

λ sin2 θ0

2(1 + λ cos θ0)

.

(A27)

In the limit of λ → 0, Eq. (9) is reproduced from Eq.
(A26). On the other hand, in the case of θH = 90◦, θ0
is also 90◦, and Eq. (22) is obtained. The divergence
of the critical current density occurs at the stable angle
satisfying P (θ0) = 0.

Appendix B: Deﬁnition of the threshold current

density in numerical simulation

We solve the LLG equation numerically from t = 0 to
t = 20 ns by using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
The time step is ∆t = 10 fs. The threshold current

density in the numerical simulation is deﬁned as a mini-
mum current density satisfying |mz(t = 20ns) − mz(t =
20ns − ∆t)| > 10−10 or |mz(t = 20ns)| > 0.9, where the
former means that the magnetization is in the oscillat-
ing state while the latter means that the magnetization
moves to ±ez direction.
