ABSTRACT
Sulphur dioxide is well-known in the atmospheres of planets and satellites, where its
presence is often associated with volcanism, and in circumstellar envelopes of young
and evolved stars as well as the interstellar medium. This work presents a line list of 1.3
billion 32S16O2 vibration-rotation transitions computed using an empirically-adjusted
potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole moment surface. The list gives complete
coverage up to 8000 cm−1 (wavelengths longer than 1.25 µm) for temperatures below
2000 K. Infrared absorption cross sections are recorded at 300 and 500 C are used to
validated the resulting ExoAmes line list. The line list is made available in electronic
form as supplementary data to this article and at www.exomol.com.

1 INTRODUCTION

Suphur dioxide, SO2, has been detected in a variety of
astrophysical settings. Within the solar system, SO2 is
known to be a major constituent of the atmospheres of
Venus (Barker 1979; Belyaev et al. 2012, 2008; Arney et al.
2014) and Jupiter’s moon, Io (Pearl et al. 1979; Nelson et al.
1980; Ballester et al. 1994). SO2 has been observed in the
atmosphere of Mars, although to a much lesser extent
(Khayat et al. 2015a). Volcanic activity is an important in-
dicator of the presence of SO2.

The chemistry of sulphur-bearing species,

including
SO2, has been studied in the atmospheres of giant plan-
ets, brown dwarfs, and dwarf stars by Visscher et al. (2006).
SO2 has been observed in circumstellar envelopes of young
and evolved stars (Yamamura et al. 1999; van der Tak et al.
2003; Ziurys 2006; Adande et al. 2013), and in molecu-
lar clouds and nebulae within the interstellar medium
(Klisch et al. 1997; Schilke et al. 2001; Crockett et al. 2010;
Belloche et al. 2013). Extragalactic detection of SO2 has
even been achieved (Martin et al. 2003, 2005), emphasising
the universal abundance of this particular molecule.

c(cid:13) 2016 The Authors

SO2 is known to occur naturally in Earth’s atmosphere
where it is found in volcanic emissions and hot springs
(Stoiber & Jepsen 1973; Khayat et al. 2015b) where obser-
vation of gases such as SO2 provide a useful tool in the un-
derstanding of such geological processes. The spectroscopic
study of SO2 can also provide insight into the history of
the Earth’s atmosphere (Whitehill et al. 2013). However its
most important impact is arguably through its contribu-
tion to the formation of acid rain (Hieta & Merimaa 2014)
where the oxidisation of SO2 to SO3 in the atmosphere, fol-
lowed by subsequent rapid reaction with water vapour re-
sults in the production of sulphuric acid (H2SO4), which
leads to many adverse environmental eﬀects. Spectra of hot
SO2 are also important for technological applications such as
monitoring engine exhausts (Voitsekhovskaya et al. 2013),
combustion (Hieta & Merimaa 2014) and etching plasmas
(Greenberg & Hargis 1990).

One of the most exciting astronomical developments in
recent years is the discovery of extrasolar planets, or “exo-
planets”. The observation of the tremendous variety of such
bodies has challenged the current understanding of solar sys-
tem and planetary formation. Exoplanet detection methods
have grown in sophistication since the inception of the ﬁeld,
however eﬀorts to characterise their atmospheres are rela-

tively new (Tinetti et al. 2013). The well-documented dis-
tribution of sulphur oxides in various terrestrial and astro-
physical environments means that a thorough understand-
ing of their fundamental spectroscopic behaviour is essen-
tial in the future analysis of the spectra of these exoplane-
tary atmospheres, and of other bodies of interest observed
through past, present and future space telescope missions
(Huang et al. 2014; Kama et al. 2013).

Experimentally, SO2 spectra have been studied in
both the ultra-violet (Freeman et al. 1984; Stark et al.
1999; Rufus et al. 2003; Danielache et al. 2008; Lyons 2008;
Rufus et al. 2009; Blackie et al. 2011; Danielache et al.
2012; Franz et al. 2013; Endo et al. 2015) and infrared
(Laﬀerty et al. 1992; Flaud & Laﬀerty 1993; Laﬀerty et al.
1993, 1996; Chu et al. 1998; Henningsen et al.
2008;
Ulenikov et al. 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) at room-
temperature; most of these data are captured in the HI-
TRAN database (Rothman et al. 2013). Conversely, there
is limited spectral data for SO2 available at elevated tem-
peratures, and much of it is either not applicable to the
spectral region of interest or consists of remote observa-
tional data requiring a sophisticated, bespoke atmospheric
model to be used in conjunction with a line list to reproduce
it (Grosch et al. 2013; Khayat et al. 2015a). However a few
measurements of cross section data have been made for hot
SO2 spectra in the laboratory by Grosch et al. (2013) and
Grosch et al. (2015a). Here we extend this work by recording
spectra of SO2 in the infrared as a function of temperature
for comparison with and validation of our computed line list.

Theoretically a number of studies have looked at the
ultraviolet spectrum spectrum of SO2 (Xie et al. 2000;
Ran et al. 2007; Leveque et al. 2015) which represents a con-
siderable challenge. More straightforward are studies of the
vibration-rotation spectrum which lies in the infrared. Early
work on this problem was performed by Kaupi & Halonen
(1992) while recent work has focused on rotational excitation
Kumar et al. (2015); Kumar & Poirier (2015). A number of
comprehensive studies has been performed by the Ames
group (Huang et al. 2014, 2015, 2016); this work provides
an important precursor to this study and will be discussed
further below.

The ExoMol project (Tennyson & Yurchenko 2012)
aims to provide molecular line lists for exoplanet and other
atmospheres with a particular emphasis on hot species.
Huang et al. (2014) used theoretical methods to compute
a line list for SO2 up to 8000 cm−1 for a temperature
of 296 K (denoted Ames-296K). This was recently ex-
tended to 5 isotopologues of SO2 (Huang et al. 2015). This
work and methodology follow closely similar studies on
H2O (Partridge & Schwenke 1997), NH3 (Huang et al. 2008,
2011a,b), and CO2 (Huang et al. 2012). In this work we
build on the work of Huang et al. (2014) to compute a line
list for hot SO2 which should be appropriate for tempera-
tures approaching 2000 K. Doing this required some techni-
cal adjustments both to the potential energy surface (PES)
used and nuclear motion program employed; these are de-
scribed in section 2. Section 3 presents our experimental
work and section 4 the line list computations. Results and
comparisons are given in section 5. Section 6 gives our con-
clusions.

2 THEORETICAL METHOD

In order to compute a line list for SO2 three things are re-
quired: a suitable potential energy surface (PES), dipole
moment surface (DMS), and a nuclear motion program
(Lodi & Tennyson 2010). The DMS used here is the ab
initio one of Huang et al. (2014) and is based on 3638
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z level calculations. The other
parts are consider in the following subsections.

2.1 Potential Energy Surface

The Ames-1B PES used here is spectroscopically determined
by reﬁning an ab initio PES using room-temperature spec-
troscopic data. The Ames-1B PES reﬁnement procedure
used is very similar to the Ames-1 reﬁnement reported by
Huang et al. (2014). The two main diﬀerences are the choice
of the initial PES and the use of a now-converged stretching
basis. The published Ames-1 PES was chosen as the initial
PES to adjust. All 22 zeroth- to fourth-order coeﬃcients of
the short-range PES terms are allowed to vary although the
zeroeth-order constant does not aﬀect the results. The num-
ber of reliable HITRAN (Rothman et al. 2013) energy levels
included with J = 0/4/20/50/70 are 23/43/183/181/129,
respectively. The corresponding weights adopted for most
levels are 2.5/1.0/1.5/2.0/3.0, respectively. For the origi-
nal Ames-1 PES coeﬃcients, the initial root mean square
ﬁt error, σrms, are 0.175 cm−1 (weighted) and 0.085 cm−1
(unweighted). The reﬁned coeﬃcient set signiﬁcantly re-
duces σrms to 0.028 cm−1 (weighted) and 0.012 cm−1 (un-
weighted). The PES is expressed in changes from equilib-
rium values of the bond lengths (∆r1, ∆r2) and bond an-
gle (∆α). Compared to the Ames-1 PES coeﬃcients, the
largest percentage variations are ±11 − 22% found for the
following short-term expansion terms: ∆α gradient, ∆r gra-
dient, ∆r(∆α)3, ∆r1∆r2, (∆r)2(∆α)2 and (∆r1)3∆r2, The
changes in absolute value are largest for (∆r1)2∆α∆r2 and
(∆r1)2(∆r2)2. The Ames-1B PES has been used in recent
SO2 isotopologue calculations (Huang et al. 2016) and is
available upon request.

The accuracy of the mass-independent Ames-1B PES
remains approximately the same as the Ames-1 PES: about
0.01 cm−1 for the three vibrational fundamentals of the
three main isotopologues, 646, 828 and 628 in HITRAN no-
tation, which therefore we can expect similar accuracy for
the fundamentals of the minor isotopologues 636, 627 and
727 (Huang et al. 2016). For vibrational states as high as
5500 cm−1, e.g. 5ν1, accuracy for isotopologues using the
Ames-1B PES should be better than 0.05 cm−1. For those
energy levels far beyond the upper limit included in our em-
pirical reﬁnement, e.g. 8000 – 10,000 cm−1 and above, the
accuracy would gradually degrade to a few wavenumbers,
approximately the quality of the original ab initio PES be-
fore empirical reﬁnement. The agreement between VTET
and DVR3D results is better than 0.01 cm−1 up to at least
8000 cm−1. However, it should be noted that the Ames-1B
PES was reﬁned using the VTET program in such a way
that although less than 500 HITRAN levels were adopted in
the reﬁnement, the accuracy is consistently as good as 0.01
– 0.02 cm−1 from 0 to 5000 cm−1. The accuracy mainly de-
pends on the energy range covered by the reﬁnement dataset,
but not on whether a particular energy level was included

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

in the reﬁnement. Recent experiments have veriﬁed the pre-
diction accuracy for non-HITRAN energy levels and bands.
New experimental data at a higher energy range may sig-
niﬁcantly extend the wavenumber range with an 0.01 – 0.02
cm−1 accuracy, provided a new reﬁnement is performed with
the new data. Currently, the accuracy of the reported line
list is best at 296 K and below 7000 cm−1. Higher energy
levels may have errors ranging from 0.5 cm−1 to a few cm−1.
Use of the Ames-1B PES with the VTET nuclear mo-
tion program (Schwenke 1996) employed by the Ames group
and DVR3D (Tennyson et al. 2004) employed here gives
very similar results for room temperature spectra. However,
one further adjustment was required for high J calculations
as the PES appears to become negative at very small HˆSH
angles. Similar problems have been encountered before with
water potentials (Choi & Light 1992; Partridge & Schwenke
1997; Shirin et al. 2003) which have been overcome by
adding a repulsive H – H term to the PES. Here we used
a slightly diﬀerent approach. The bisector-embedding im-
plementation in DVR3D has the facility to omit low-angle
points from the calculation (Tennyson & Sutcliﬀe 1992);
usually only a few automatically-chosen points are omitted.
An amendment to module DVR3DRJZ allowed for the se-
lection of the appropriate PES region by omitting all low-
angle functions beyond a user-speciﬁed DVR grid point. This
amendment was essential for the high J calculations. This
version of the code was used for all calculations with J ≥ 50
pressented. For J < 50 this defect only aﬀected very high
rovibrational energies computed in ROTLEV3B and there
has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the results.

2.2 Nuclear motion calculations

The line list was produced using the DVR3D program
suite (Tennyson et al. 2004) and involved rotationally ex-
cited states up to J = 165. As this doubled the highest J
value previously computed using DVR3D, a number of ad-
justments were necessary compared to the published version
of the code.

Firstly, the improved rotational Hamiltonian construc-
tion algorithm implemented by Azzam et al. (2016) was
employed; this proved vital to making the calculations
tractable. Secondly,
it was necessary to adjust the au-
tomated algorithm which generates (associated) Gauss-
Legendre quadarature points and weigths: the previous al-
gorithm failed for grids of more than 90 points but a sim-
ple brute-force search for zeroes in the associated Legen-
dre P k
N (x) was found to work well for all N and k val-
ues tested (N ≤ 150). Thirdly, the DVR3D algorithm re-
lies on solving a Coriolis-decoupled vibrational problem for
each (J, k), where k is the projection of the rotational mo-
tion quantum number, J, onto the chosen body-ﬁxed z axis.
This provides a basis set from which functions used to solve
the fully-coupled rovibrational problem are selected on en-
ergy grounds Sutcliﬀe et al. (1988). Our calculations showed
that for k values above 130 no functions were selected so an
option was implemented in which only (J, k) combinations
which contributed functions were actually considered. This
update does not save signiﬁcant computer time, since the ini-
tial (J, k) calculations are quick, but does reduce disk usage
which also proved to be a signiﬁcant issue in the calcula-
tions. Finally, it was found that algorithm used in module

DIPOLE3 to read in the wavefunctions led to signiﬁcant in-
put/output problems. This module was re-written to reduce
the number of times these wavefunctions needed to be read.

tory (https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/).

so-called

DVR3D calculations were performed in Radau
coordinates using
embedding
(Tennyson & Sutcliﬀe 1992) which places the body-ﬁxed
axis close to standard A principle axis of SO2 meaning
the k used by the program is close to the standard
asymmetric top approximate quantum number Ka. The
DVR (discrete variable representation) calculations are
based on grid points corresponding to Morse oscillator-like
functions (Tennyson & Sutcliﬀe 1982) for the stretches and
(associated) Legendre polynomials for the bend.

The rotational step in the calculation selects the low-
est n(J + 1) functions from the (J, k)-dependent vibrational
functions on energy grounds where n is parameter which was
chosen to converge the rotational energy levels. For J < 100
it was found that n = 725 was required to get good conver-
gence. However such calculations become computationally
expensive for high J values for which, in practice, fewer lev-
els are required. Reducing the value of n to 500 was found
to have essentially no eﬀect on the convergence of rovibra-
tional eigenvalues produced at J = 124. For J = 124, there
are a total of 14 523 eigenvalues below 15 000 cm−1 summed
over all rotational symmetries. This constitutes roughly 8%
of the total combined matrix dimension of 175 450 for n =
725 and 12% of 121 000 for n = 500. The value n = 725
was originally obtained for convergence of energies at J =
60, where the number of eigenvalues below 15 000 cm−1 ac-
counts for 38% of the combined matrix dimension of 88 450.
The higher energies at J = 60 are much more sensitive to
the value of n due to the way the basis functions are dis-
tributed, whereas for J ≥ 120 the energies below the 15 000
cm−1 threshold are already easily converged at lower values
of n. It was therefore decided to reduce n to 500 for J ≥ 124
which leads to minimal loss of accuracy.

Convergence of rovibrational energy levels with n = 725
was obtained using J = 60 calculations. The sum of energies
below 10 000, 11 000, 12 000, 13 000, 14 000, and 15000 cm−1
was used to give an indication of the convergence below those
levels (see Table 3.1 in Underwood (2016) Thesis]). J = 60
coincides with the largest number of ro-vibrational energies
lying below 15 000 cm−1, and thus the higher energies here
are the most sensitive to the convergence tests. The value
n = 725 ensures that the sum of all energies below 10 000
cm−1 and 15 000 cm−1 are fully converged to within 0.0001
cm−1 and to 1 cm−1, respectively. Computed DVR3D rovi-
brational energies above 10 000 cm−1, though converged,
can not be guaranteed to be spectroscopically accurate, and
are entirely dependent on the quality of the PES. This may
have minor repercussions on the convergence of the partition
function at the high end of the temperature range. Table 1
summarises the parameters used in the DVR3D calculations
while Table 2 compares vibrational term values computed
with DVR3D and VTET.

3 LINE LIST CALCULATIONS

Calculations were performed on the High Performance Com-
puting Service Darwin cluster, located in Cambridge, UK.
Each job from DVR3DRJZ, ROTLEV3B and DIPOLE3 is
submitted to a single computing node consisting of two 2.60
GHz 8-core Intel Sandy Bridge E5-2670 processors, therefore
making use of a total of 16 CPUs each through OpenMP
parallelisation of the various BLAS routines in each mod-
ule. A maximum of 36 hours and 64 Gb of RAM are avail-
able for each calculation on a node. The DVR3DRJZ runs
generally did not require more than 2 hours of wall clock
time. The most computationally demanding parts of the
line list calculation are in ROTLEV3B for the diagonalisa-
tion of the Hamiltonian matrices, where wall clock time in-
creases rapidly with increasing J. Matrix diagonalisation in
all cases was performed using the LAPACK routine DSYEV
(Anderson et al. 1999).

The calculations considered all levels with J ≤ 165 and
energies below 15 000 cm−1. This gave a total of 3 255 954
energy levels. Einstein-A coeﬃcients were computed for all
allowed transitions linking any energy level below 8000 cm−1
with any level below 15 000 cm−1. The parameters J ≤ 165
and Elow = 8000 cm−1 determine the upper temperature
for which the line list is complete; the upper energy cut-
oﬀ of 15 000 cm−1 means that this line list is complete
for all transitions longwards of 1.25 µm. In practice, the
rotation-vibration spectrum of SO2 is very weak at wave-
lengths shorter than this and can therefore safely be ne-
glected. In the line list, known as ExoAmes, contains a total
of 1.3 billion Einstein-A coeﬃcients.

The partition function can be used to assess the com-
pleteness of the line list as a function of temperature, T
(Neale et al. 1996). The value of the partition function at T
= 296 K, computed using all our energy levels is 6337.131.
With a cut-oﬀ of J ≤ 80, as used by Huang et al. (2014),
the value for the same temperature is computed as 6336.803,
which is in excellent agreement with their calculated value
of 6336.789. Figure 1 shows the partition function values as
a function of a J cut-oﬀ for a range of T . The highest value
of J considered, J = 165, deﬁnes the last point where the
lowest energy is less than 8000 cm−1, which is used as the
maximum value of lower energy states in DIPOLE3 calcula-

tions. As can be seen from this ﬁgure, the partition function
is well converged for J = 165 at all temperatures.

The J-dependent convergence of Q gives a good indi-
cation of the completeness of the computed energy levels
with respect to their signiﬁcance at each temperature. How-
ever in order to ascertain the reliability of the line list for
increasing temperatures it is more pertinent to observe the
convergence of Q as a function of energy cut-oﬀ; this is il-
lustrated in Figure 2. The importance of this lies in the fact
that the computed line list in the current work only consid-
ers transitions from energy levels below 8000 cm−1. Since
the physical interpretation of an energy level’s contribution
to Q is the probability of it’s occupancy, the completeness
of the line list can only be guaranteed if all transitions from
states with non-negligible population are computed. In other
words, the line list may only be considered 100 % complete
if Q is converged when summing over all E ≤ 8000 cm−1.

Figure 2 shows that, at a cut-oﬀ of 8000 cm−1, the parti-
tion function is not fully converged for T = 1500 K. Despite
computing all rovibrational levels below 8000 cm−1 (J ≤
165), and all transitions from these states to states with

Figure 4. Optical set up used in the SO2 infrared absorption
measurements.

E ≤ 15 000 cm−1, there is still a minor contribution from
energies above this cut-oﬀ to the partition sum, correspond-
ing to all values of J. However, the neglected transitions are
expected to make only a small additional contribution to
the overall intensity at this temperature. The completeness
of the line list may be quantiﬁed by considering the ratio
of the partition function at the 8000 cm−1 cut-oﬀ and the
total partition function, QTotal, which takes into account all
computed energies. Figure 3 shows this ratio as a function
of temperature.

For T ≤ 1500 K the line list is over 96 % complete. As
can be seen from Figure 3 the level of completeness decreases
with increasing temperature; at 2000 K the ratio falls to 86
%, and as low as 33 % for 5000 K. These values assume that
QTotal is equal to the ‘true’ value of the partition function
and tests suggest that for T = 3000 − 5000 K, the partition
function is still converged to within 0.1 % when all computed
energy levels are taken into consideration.

Table 3 gives a portion of the SO2 states ﬁle. As DVR3D
does not provide approximate quantum numbers, Ka, Kc
and the vibrational labels ν1, ν2 and ν3, these have been
taken from the calculations of Huang et al. (2014), where
possible, by matching J, parity and energy; these quantum
numbers are approximate and may be updated in future as
better estimates become available. Table 4 gives a portion of
the transitions ﬁle. This ﬁle contains 1.3 billion transitions
and has been split into smaller ﬁles for ease of downloading.

performed for temperatures up to 500 C using a quartz high-
temperature gas ﬂow cell (q-HGC). This cell is described in
details by Grosch et al. (2013) and has recently been used
for measurements of hot NH3 (Barton et al. 2015), sulphur-
containing gases (Grosch et al. 2015b) and some PAH com-
pounds (Grosch et al. 2015c). The optical set-up is shown in
Fig. 4. The set-up includes a high-resolution Fourier trans-
form infraread (FTIR) spectrometer (Agilent 660 with a
linearized MCT and DTGS detectors), the q-HGC and a
light-source (Hawkeye, IR-Si217, 1385C) with a KBr plano-
convex lens. The light source is placed in the focus of the
KBr lens. The FTIR and sections between the FTIR/q-GHC
and q-HGC/IR light source were purged using CO2/H2O-
free air obtained from a purge generator. Bottles with pre-
mixed gas mixture, N2 + SO2 (5000 ppm) (Strandmøllen)
and N2 (99.998%) (AGA) were used for reference and SO2
absorbance measurements. Three calibrated mass-ﬂow con-
trollers (Bronkhorst) were used to balance ﬂow in the middle
(N2+SO2) and the two buﬀer (N2) parts on the q-HGC and
to make additional dilution of the SO2 to lower concentra-
tions.

SO2 absorbance measurements were performed at 0.25
– 0.5 cm−1 nominal spectral resolution and at around atmo-
spheric pressure in the q-HGC. The experimental SO2 ab-
sorption spectra were calculated as described in Section 3.1
of Barton et al. (2015). Spectra were recorded in the range
500 – 8000 cm−1 and at temperatures of 25, 200, 300, 400
and 500 C. However at the low SO2 concentrations used the
absorption spectrum was too weak above 2500 cm−1 to yield
useful cross sections. The weak bands centred at 550 cm−1
and 2400 cm−1 are observed but use of higher concentra-
tions of SO2 is needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
Here we concentrate on the features in the 1000 – 1500 cm−1
region. In this region, experimental uncertainties in the ab-
sorption cross sections of the ν3 band do not exceed 0.5 %.
This accuracy is conﬁrmed by comparison of 25 C SO2 ab-
sorption cross sections measureed at DTU with those avail-
able in the PNNL (Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory)
database (Sharpe et al. 2004).

4.1 Results

4.2 Comparison with HITRAN

There are 72 459 lines for SO2 in the HITRAN2012 database
(Rothman et al. 2013), which include rovibrational energies
up to and including J = 99. In order to quantitatively com-
pare energy levels and absolute intensities a similar approach
was adopted to that of Huang et al. (2014). In order to com-
pare energy levels, the HITRAN transitions are transformed
into a list of levels labelled by their appropriate upper and
lower state quantum numbers; energies are obtained from
the usual lower energy column, E ′′, and upper energies are
also obtained via E ′′ + ν. Any duplication from the combi-
nation diﬀerence method is removed, and energies are only
kept if the HITRAN error code for line position satisﬁes the
condition ierr ≥ 4, ensuring all line position uncertainties are
under 1 × 10−3 cm−1. For this reason, the ν1 +ν3, ν1+ν2+ν3
and 3ν3 bands are excluded from the current comparison, as
by Huang et al. (2014). This leaves a total of 13 507 rovi-
brational levels across 10 vibrational bands available for the
comparison which is given in Table 5.

Unsurprisingly, the agreement with the corresponding
comparison by Huang et al. (2014) is fairly consistent. There
are some minor deviations in ∆max, though the values of
∆RMS are comparable. These deviations are largely deter-
mined by the use of the Ames-1B PES in the DVR3D cal-
culations.

HITRAN band positions and intensities are compared
to the data produced in the current work, again in a similar
fashion to Huang et al. (2014); all 13 HITRAN bands are
compared (despite three of these being excluded from their
energy level comparisons). In Huang et al.’s comparison all
transitions associated with 2ν3 and Ka = 11 levels were
excluded due to a resonance of the band with ν1 + 3ν2; the
same exclusion has been applied here.

A total of 70 830 transitions are available for com-
parison here, taking into account those corresponding to
energy levels with J > 80. A matching criteria close to
that used for energy level matching, with the addition
that the Obs. - Calc. residuals for ν also satisfy ≤ 0.2
cm−1 was used. The algorithm used is prone to double-
matching, leading to comparisons which may be reasonable
in wavenumber residuals but not in intensity deviations. In
these instances, the intensity comparisons are screened via
the symmetric residual (Huang et al. 2014) δ(I)% = 50%
×(IExoAmes/IHITRAN − IHITRAN/IExoAmes), where the best
match is found where this value is at a minimum. These cri-
teria have been able to match all available lines, with the
exception of the 001 − 000 band which matches only 5686
out of 5721 lines. 35 lines were excluded from our statistics
because there appears to be systematic errors in HITRAN
for energy levels with Ka ≥ 33, see Ulenikov et al. (2013)
and Huang et al. (2014). Table 6 shows a statistical sum-
mary of the band comparisons.

The standard deviations in line position, σ(∆ν), and
line intensity, σ(δI), are in fairly good agreement with those
of Huang et al. despite the use of a diﬀerent PES, and the
inclusion of energies with J > 80. The diﬀerences in mini-
mum, maximum, and average values may be attributed to
our inclusion of higher J levels, though the tighter restric-
tion on the line intensity matching algorithm used in this
work may also contribute.

4.3 Comparison with High-Temperature

Measurements

Figures 5 and 6 show the simulated cross sections for the
1000 < ν < 1500 cm−1 spectral region at 573.15 K (300 C)
and 773.15 K (500 C), respectively, convolved with a Gaus-
sian line shape function with HWHM = 0.25 cm−1. These
are compared with experimental cross sections measured at
a resolution of 0.5 cm−1. The simulations are calculated us-
ing a cross section code, ‘ExoCross’, developed work with
the ExoMol line list format (Tennyson et al. 2013, 2016),
based on the principles outlined by Hill et al. (2013).

This spectral region considered contains both the ν1
and ν3 bands, and the intensity features are qualitatively
well represented by the simulated cross sections. For 573.15
K (300 C) the integrated intensity across the 1000 < ν <
1500 cm−1 spectral region is calculated as 3.43 × 10−17 cm2
molecule−1, which is about 2% less than that for the exper-
imental value, measured as 3.50 × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1.

Figure 6. Comparison of absorption cross sections obtained at
T = 773.15 K for SO2 via experimentally (above) and from the

the same spectral region is calculated as 3.41 × 10−17 cm2
molecule−1, which is roughly 6% less than that for the exper-
imental value, 3.62 × 10−17 cm2 molecule−1. This may be
attributed to a small discrepancy observed in the P-branch
of the ν3 band which is not obvious from Figure 6; the in-
tensity here is slightly lower for the computed cross sections.
Since this disagreement aﬀects a speciﬁc region of the spec-
trum, it is unlikely wholly due to an error in the partition
sum. The quality of the DMS may also be a contributing
factor, in conjunction with the states involved in these tran-
sitions. Another source may be from the generation of the
cross sections themselves; the line shape function used in
constructing the theoretical cross sections is Gaussian, and
therefore only considers thermal (Doppler) broadening, as
opposed to a combination of thermal and pressure broaden-
ing (Voigt line shape). It is possible that neglecting the (un-
known) pressure-broadening contribution in the line shape
convolution is the source of this disagreement. Regardless of
this discrepancy, use of a Voigt proﬁle would considerably
improve the overall quality of computed cross sections.

4.4 Cross Sections

Figures 7 - 10 display temperature-dependent calculated
cross sections for the rotational and two fundamental bands
of SO2. All simulations are produced using the hot line list
convolved with a Gaussian line shape function with HWHM
= 0.5 cm−1.

Figure 11 shows an overview plot of the spectrum
for 0 < ν < 8000 cm−1(λ > 1.25 µm), highlighting
the temperature-dependence of the cross section intensities.
Again, this simulation is produced using the hot line list
convolved with a Gaussian line shape function with HWHM
= 2.0 cm−1.

5 CONCLUSION

A new hot line list for SO2, called ExoAmes, has been
computed containing 1.3 billion transitions. The line
is divided into an energy ﬁle and a transitions
list
ﬁle. This is done using the standard ExoMol
format
(Tennyson et al. 2013) based on the method originally

SO2 is one of three astrophysically-important sulphur
oxides. A room temperature line list for SO3 has already
been computed (Underwood et al. 2013) and a hot line list
has recently been completed. The results of these calcula-
tions will be compared with recent observations recorded at
DTU. The comparison and the line list will be presented
here soon.

Unlike SO2 and SO3, SO is an open shell system with
a 3Σ+ symmetry electronic ground states which therefore
requires special treatment (Schwenke 2015). A line list for
this system will soon be computed with the program Duo
(Yurchenko et al. 2016) which has been newly-developed for
treating precisely this sort of problem.
