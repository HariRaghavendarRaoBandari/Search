Abstract

We investigate how the dimensionless ratio given by the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate ΓCS divided by the product of
the entropy density s and temperature T behaves across diﬀerent kinds of phase transitions in the class of bottom-up
non-conformal Einstein-dilaton holographic models originally proposed by Gubser and Nellore. By tuning the dilaton
potential, one is able to holographically mimic a ﬁrst order, a second order, or a crossover transition. In a ﬁrst order
phase transition, ΓCS/sT jumps at the critical temperature (as previously found in the holographic literature), while in a
second order phase transition it develops an inﬁnite slope. On the other hand, in a crossover, ΓCS/sT behaves smoothly,
although displaying a fast variation around the pseudo-critical temperature. Furthermore, we also ﬁnd that ΓCS/sT
increases by orders of magnitude below the critical temperature in a second order phase transition and in a crossover.
In all the cases, ΓCS/sT increases with decreasing T . The behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate across diﬀerent
phase transitions is expected to play a relevant role for the chiral magnetic eﬀect around the QCD critical end point,
which is a second order phase transition point connecting a crossover band to a line of ﬁrst order phase transition.

Keywords: Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate, ﬁnite temperature, holography.

1. Introduction

The vacuum of non-Abelian gauge theories deﬁned in
Euclidean space possesses a rich topological structure fea-
µν (cid:54)= 0)
turing, for instance, non-trivial local minima (F a
distinct from the trivial global minimum of the theory.
These local minima are labeled by the values of the Pon-
tryagin index, Chern-Simons number or topological charge
of the associated gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations and correspond
to diﬀerent topological sectors (or “vacua”) of the true,
gauge-invariant vacuum of the system, the so-called θ-
vacuum, which is given by a superposition of the diﬀer-
ent topological vacua of the theory. Within each topo-
logical sector, the action of the system is bounded from
below by a multiple of the (absolute value of the) topo-
logical charge, with the bound being saturated by topo-
logical ﬁeld conﬁgurations satisfying the self-duality con-
dition F a
2 µναβF αβ a [1]. Such topological
conﬁgurations at zero temperature are called instantons
[2, 3]. An instanton with topological charge Q may be
interpreted as a quantum tunneling process between two
diﬀerent topological vacua labeled by |N(cid:105) and |N +Q(cid:105). At
nonzero temperature, thermal saddle point conﬁgurations
of the non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld which are able to modify

the topological charge may be also relevant. In the con-
text of the electroweak sector of the standard model, these
thermal conﬁgurations are called sphalerons [4, 5].

The Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate ΓCS is a real time,
non-equilibrium observable measuring the rate of change
of the topological charge per unit of volume and per unit
of time. This observable has vast phenomenological rel-
evance. For instance, the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate in
the electroweak sector is related to the violation of baryon
number and, therefore, to the baryogenesis process in the
early universe [6, 7, 8, 9].
In the context of the strong
interaction, the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate is relevant
to the study of the Chiral Magnetic Eﬀect (CME) ex-
pected to take place in non-central heavy ion collisions
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

In the perturbative regime of Yang-Mills theory, valid
at weak coupling, the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate has
been widely studied in the literature, see for instance Refs.
[16, 17, 18, 19] and references therein. In order to access
the strong coupling regime of some non-Abelian gauge the-
ories with gravity duals, the gauge/gravity duality [20, 21,
22, 23] has been employed to compute the Chern-Simons
diﬀusion rate in a large variety of diﬀerent holographic
settings, as in Refs. [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. However, no
systematic study on the general properties of the Chern-
Simons diﬀusion rate across diﬀerent types of phase tran-
sitions has been undertaken on the literature yet.

In this work, we ﬁx the gauge corresponding to the con-
dition r = φ, which may be attained due to the freedom
of reparameterization of the radial coordinate. The radial
position of the black hole horizon is given by the largest
root of h(φH ) = 0, while the boundary of the asymptoti-
cally AdS5 space lies at φ = 0.

The functional form of the dilaton potential we shall

employ in the present work is given by

cosh(γφ) + b2φ2 + b4φ4 + b6φ6

In the present work, we set to unity the radius L of the
asymptotically AdS5 space. Diﬀerent choices of the free
parameters a, γ, b2, b4, and b6 in Eq. (3) may mimic the
properties of physical systems with diﬀerent kinds of phase
transitions in the gauge theory [37, 38, 39], and we shall
explore it in the next sections in order to investigate the
behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate in ﬁrst and
second order phase transitions and also in a crossover.

As discussed in Ref.

[37], the Einstein-dilaton equa-
tions of motion in the r = φ gauge may be cast into the
form of a single master equation, namely,

where we deﬁned the master function G(φ) ≡ A(cid:48)(φ). The
master equation (4) may be numerically solved by integrat-
ing it out from the horizon φ = φH up to the boundary
φ = 0 with the following initial conditions imposed at the
horizon,

which follow from Einstein’s equations [39]. Each value of
φH translates into some physical state in the gauge theory
with deﬁnite values of temperature T and entropy density

The full background geometry can be reconstructed
from the master function G(φ) using the following rela-

The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at the Rela-
tivistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is currently probing
regions of the QCD phase diagram at ﬁnite temperature
T and nonzero baryon chemical potential µB where the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [30, 31, 32] produced in ultra-
relativistic heavy ion collisions [33, 34, 35, 36] is highly
non-conformal and behaves as a strongly coupled ﬂuid.
One of the main aims of the BES is to ﬁnd out the QCD
critical end point (CEP) location in the (T, µB) phase di-
agram, which is a second order phase transition point con-
necting the crossover band at lower µB to a line of ﬁrst or-
der phase transition at higher µB. Therefore, around the
QCD CEP, one expects the system to probe diﬀerent kinds
of phase transitions and the behavior of the Chern-Simons
diﬀusion rate in this region is of particular relevance for the
phenomenology of the CME. As a ﬁrst glimpse into this
issue, one might study the behavior of the Chern-Simons
diﬀusion rate in simple models displaying diﬀerent kinds
of phase transitions.

In this work, we employ the class of bottom-up non-
conformal Einstein-dilaton holographic models originally
proposed by Gubser and Nellore in Ref. [37] and investi-
gate how the dimensionless ratio ΓCS/sT behaves across
diﬀerent types of phase transitions. By adequately ad-
justing the dilaton potential one is able to induce, on the
dual gauge ﬁeld theory, a ﬁrst order, a second order, or
a crossover transition. As originally found in Ref.
[27],
we conclude that in a ﬁrst order phase transition ΓCS/sT
jumps at the critical temperature. As the new results of
the present work, we ﬁnd that in a second order phase
transition ΓCS/sT develops an inﬁnite slope at the critical
temperature, while displaying a smooth but fast varying
temperature proﬁle around the pseudo-critical tempera-
ture in a crossover transition. Furthermore, we also ﬁnd
that ΓCS/sT increases by orders of magnitude below the
critical temperature in a second order phase transition and
in a crossover. In all the cases, ΓCS/sT increases with de-
creasing T . Our conclusions are shown to be robust in
face of the choice of diﬀerent proﬁles for the axion-dilaton
coupling previously derived in the literature.

We use natural units where  = kB = c = 1 and a

mostly plus metric signature.

2. Einstein-dilaton holographic model

In this section, we brieﬂy review the main results con-
cerning the Einstein-dilaton holographic setup originally
proposed in Ref. [37], which has been also extensively dis-
cussed, for instance, in Refs.
[38, 39, 40]. We refer the
reader to consult these references for further details.

3. Axion ﬁeld and Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate

In this section, we review the derivation of the holo-
graphic formula for the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate in gen-
eral dilaton black hole backgrounds originally obtained in
Ref.
[27]. This formula holds when the black hole solu-
tions are the dominant saddle points of the system, and as
we are going to discuss in the next sections, this will be
always the case for the potentials used here emulating a
second order phase transition or a crossover, while for the
case of a ﬁrst order phase transition it will hold only for
T ≥ Tc, where Tc is the critical temperature of the phase
transition.

The Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate is a real time observ-
able which measures the rate of change of the topological
charge per unit of volume and per unit of time. It may be
calculated through the following Kubo’s formula [27],

1The topological charge Q is related to the instanton number

According to the holographic dictionary, the θ-angle is
given by the boundary value of a bulk axion ﬁeld in an
asymptotically AdS5 space.

We work here in the classical gravity approximation of
the holographic correspondence, valid at strong coupling
and large number of colors in the gauge theory.
In this
regime, the axion ﬁeld is taken as a probe over the back-
ground solutions of the Einstein-dilaton model, with its
action given by

where Z(φ) is the axion-dilaton coupling and α(φ = 0) =
θ. Then, through the holographic correspondence, corre-
lation functions of q(x) in the gauge theory are extracted
from the on-shell action for the axion ﬁeld. More precisely,
in order to pursue the holographic calculation of the ther-
mal retarded two-point Green’s function in Eq. (12), one
follows the prescription originally introduced in Ref. [24]:

1. The ﬁrst step is to consider a plane-wave ansatz for
the Fourier modes of a probe axion ﬂuctuation on
top of the (Einstein-dilaton) backgrounds;2

2. Next, one substitutes this plane-wave ansatz into the
probe action (13) and obtains the linearized equation
of motion for the axion perturbation, which must be
subjected to the boundary condition that the pertur-
bation is normalized to unity at the boundary and
that the wave is in-falling at the horizon;

3. Then, in order to obtain the retarded propagator in
Eq. (12), one needs to solve the equation of motion
for the perturbation with (cid:126)k = (cid:126)0 and small ω, plug the
solution into the action (13) and discard the horizon
piece of the on-shell disturbed action, working solely
with the boundary on-shell action.

(19)

Due to the Kubo’s formula (12), in order to obtain the
Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate we just need to evaluate (19)
at (cid:126)k = (cid:126)0 and ω (cid:28) T : in this case, as originally discussed
in Ref. [27], it is simple to solve Eq. (17) using the near-
horizon matching technique, or, alternatively, the mem-
brane paradigm [43]. We employ here the near-horizon
matching method, which consists in ﬁrst solving Eq. (17)
with ω = 0 and then expanding the result around the hori-
zon, with the outcome of such calculation being matched
with the outcome of the reverse order of operations, where
one ﬁrst solves the asymptotic form of Eq. (17) near the
horizon and then expands the result around ω = 0.

The ﬁrst step is to solve Eq.

(17) with (cid:126)k = (cid:126)0 and
ω = 0, which may be done in closed form in terms of the
background:

δα

= C1 + C2

By applying the Dirichlet condition (16) into Eq. (20), one
ﬁxes C1 = 1, and substituting it into Eq. (19), one ﬁnds
that

qq (ω (cid:28) T, (cid:126)k = (cid:126)0) =
G(R)

C2
2κ2 .

(21)

In order to ﬁx the integration constant C2, we ex-
pand (20) around φ = φH , using that h(φ → φH ) =

where we used Eq. (10).

Now we revert the order of operations and ﬁrst solve
the asymptotic form of Eq. (17) with (cid:126)k = (cid:126)0 close to the
horizon, obtaining

= C−(φH − φ)−iω/4πT + C+(φH − φ)iω/4πT .

The in-falling wave condition at the horizon is imposed by
setting C+ = 0. Now we expand the result around ω = 0,

Finally, we match the terms of same order in Eqs. (22)

(24)

and (24), ﬁxing the integration constants

C− = 1, C2 = −iωZ(φH )e3A(φH ).
Then, by using Eq. (11), one ﬁnds that [27]

where the temperature dependence of the dimensionless
ratio ΓCS/sT is encoded in the interplay between the form
of the axion-dilaton coupling function Z(φ) and the in-
verse relation φH (T ), with the latter being determined by
the form of the dilaton potential V (φ). In the following
sections, we are going to discuss how diﬀerent choices of
V (φ) translate in terms of the behavior of ΓCS/sT across
diﬀerent kinds of phase transitions and will also discuss
the inﬂuence of diﬀerent choices of Z(φ) on the results.

The diﬀerent potentials we shall employ in the present
work fall within the functional form of Eq. (3). Regard-
ing the axion-dilaton coupling, we shall consider here two
diﬀerent functional forms, namely,

(28)

Since we shall present our results for ΓCS/sT normalized
by its value at T → ∞, in face of Eq. (26), the free param-
eter Z0 in the proﬁle (27) drops out in such normalization
and we just need to consider diﬀerent values of Z1. The
axion-dilaton proﬁle in Eq. (27) was proposed in Ref. [27]
in the context of a bottom-up Einstein-dilaton holographic
model mimicking the ﬁrst order phase transition seen on
lattice simulations of pure Yang-Mills theory3, while the
proﬁle in Eq. (28) was obtained in Refs. [44, 45] in a top-
down Einstein-axion-dilaton setup constructed as a solu-
tion of type IIB supergravity dual to a spatially anisotropic
N = 4 Super Yang-Mills plasma. As we are going to show
in the next sections, both proﬁles in Eqs. (27) and (28)
produce qualitatively similar results for ΓCS/sT . The dis-
tinctive qualitative features of ΓCS/sT we shall see in the
following sections will be determined by the nature of the
phase transition considered, which in turn depends on the
chosen parameters of the dilaton potential in Eq. (3).

with a ﬁrst order phase transition, which may be modeled
by the choice of parameters shown in Table 1 for the dila-
ton potential in Eq. (3). This particular choice has been
used previously in Ref. [39] to calculate the Polyakov loop
and the Debye screening mass in a system with a ﬁrst or-
der conﬁnement-deconﬁnement phase transition with its
thermodynamics closely resembling lattice data for pure
SU (3) Yang-Mills theory (see [39] for further details).

We restrict our calculations in this section to tempera-
tures at or above the critical temperature (to be discussed
below), which is the range where the black hole solutions
constitute the dominant saddle points of the action (1)
in a system with a ﬁrst order phase transition, in which
case we can apply Eq. (26) to calculate the Chern-Simons
diﬀusion rate in the high temperature phase.

In order to study the thermodynamics of this system,
we follow the standard analysis presented, for example,
in Refs.
[37, 39, 46]. The thermodynamics of the sys-
tem is characterized by its equation of state, which may
be expressed as the temperature dependence of the en-
tropy density s(T ), the pressure p(T ), the speed of sound
squared c2
s(T ), the internal energy density (T ), or the
trace anomaly I(T ).
In the present holographic setting,
one ﬁrst numerically solves the master equation (4) and
obtains T as a function of the black hole horizon φH using
Hawking’s formula for the black hole temperature in Eq.
(10). The entropy density as a function of φH is given
by Bekenstein-Hawking’s relation [47, 48] in Eq.
(11).
Then, s(T ) is obtained by numerically interpolating a ta-
ble of points in the format {T (φH ), s(φH )} with φH run-
ning through diﬀerent values in the thermodynamically
favored range for black hole solutions (to be discussed be-
low). Once one has holographically derived the equation
of state s(T ), one can obtain p(T ), c2
s(T ), (T ), and I(T )
by using standard thermodynamic relations.

In Fig. 1 (a), we plot T (φH ) normalized by the crit-
H ≈ 2.19) = Tc, which in a sys-
ical temperature T (φc
tem with a ﬁrst order phase transition is identiﬁed with
the temperature at which the black hole pressure (to be
discussed below) vanishes coming from positive values at
higher temperatures. One notes that T (φH )/Tc has a
H ≈ 3.2) = Tmin ≈ 0.9Tc, be-
global minimum at T (φmin
low which there are no black hole solutions. The non-
monotonicity of T (φH )/Tc indicates the presence of two
competing branches of black hole solutions for T > Tmin,
the so-called big black hole solutions identiﬁed by the black
hole branch with φH < φmin
H , and the small black hole
branch identiﬁed by φH > φmin
H .4 There is also a solu-

4Note that the larger the value of φH the more distant is the black

tion to the equations of motion with no horizon, obtained
by setting to zero the blackening function h in the metric
ansatz, which is the vacuum solution. By going to Eu-
clidean space and compactifying the imaginary Euclidean
time direction over a circle with circumference β = 1/T ,
the vacuum solution is promoted to a thermal gas solution,
which exists for any value of T . Below Tmin, the thermal
gas solution is the only nontrivial solution to the equa-
tions of motion (given our ansatze for the Einstein-dilaton
ﬁelds). However, for T > Tmin there are three competing
solutions, the big and small black hole solutions and the
thermal gas solution, and in order to decide which solution
is the dominant saddle point of the model at each value of
T , one must compare their pressures and check which one
has the largest pressure: this is the thermodynamically
favored solution at a given T .

The pressure of the black hole solutions is obtained by
integrating the black hole entropy density with respect to
the temperature,

(cid:90)

p(T ) =

dT s(T ).

(29)

The integration constant in Eq. (29) may be ﬁxed by going
into the small black hole branch in the limit of vanishing
horizon, φH → ∞, which coincides with the vacuum solu-
tion metric, and imposing that in this limit the black hole
pressure matches the pressure of the thermal gas back-
ground, which is a constant that can be chosen to be zero.
Therefore, we may write the black hole pressure as

p(φH ) =

The result is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (a), where we
plotted the dimensionless ratio5 κ2p/T 4. One can see that
for φH < φc
H , the black hole pressure is positive, going to
zero at φH = φc
H , while it becomes negative for φH > φc
H ,
asymptoting to zero from below for φH → ∞. Therefore,
one concludes that the big black hole branch is thermody-
namically favored for T > Tc, while below Tc the thermal
gas solution is the dominant saddle point. Consequently,
at T = Tc the system undergoes a ﬁrst order Hawking-
Page phase transition from black hole geometries to ther-
mal gas geometries [55]. Note also that the small black

hole horizon from the boundary of the asymptotically AdS5 space.
Therefore, large φH implies a small sized horizon and vice-versa.
5In N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory, one has the following rela-
tion between the gravitational constant and the number of colors of
the gauge theory: κ2 = 4π2L3/N 2
c [49]. In bottom-up models, as
the present one, the precise relation between κ2 and Nc is unknown.
However, in phenomenological approaches, κ2 may be ﬁxed, for in-
stance, by seeding the bottom-up model with lattice QCD data, as
done in Refs. [39, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]. In the present work, we do not
worry to ﬁx any value for κ2 since this will be of no relevance for the
qualitative results we are going to obtain (note that the only thing
κ2 can do is to shift the height of the curves without changing their
shapes).

hole branch is always thermodynamically unstable in the
present model.
One may obtain p(T ) by numerically interpolating a
table of points in the format {T (φH ), p(φH )} with φH run-
ning from6 φc
H up to some small numeric value correspond-
ing to high T geometries7. The internal energy density is
given by (T ) = T s(T ) − p(T ), while the trace anomaly
is deﬁned as I(T ) = (T ) − 3p(T ).8 The speed of sound
squared is obtained through the relation c2
s(T ) = dp/d =
d ln(T )/d ln(s). The corresponding results for dimension-
less ratios of these thermodynamic variables normalized
by adequate powers of T are shown in Fig. 1 (b) and
(c). One observes that κ2s/T 3, c2
s, κ2/T 4, and κ2I/T 4
jump at T = Tc, while the pressure vanishes. For T (cid:29) Tc,
all these dimensionless observables tend to their conformal
values. In particular, κ2I/T 4 goes to zero at high temper-
atures, when our model recovers conformal invariance.
In Fig. 2, we show our results for the dimensionless
ratio ΓCS/sT normalized by its value at T → ∞ for dif-
ferent choices of the axion-dilaton coupling function. One
notes that the diﬀerent axion-dilaton couplings produce
the same qualitative results, with the Chern-Simons dif-
fusion rate jumping at Tc in a ﬁrst order phase transition
[27]. The fact that the diﬀerent proﬁles for the axion-
dilaton coupling in Eqs. (27) and (28) give the same qual-
itative results is mainly related to the fact that both cou-
plings present an exponential dependence on φ, therefore,

from Eq.
Since φH (T ) is determined by the chosen proﬁle for V (φ),
the diﬀerent axion-dilaton couplings in Eqs. (27) and (28)
can only produce quantitatively distinct results, with the
qualitative features remaining the same. Therefore, as we
are going to see in the next two sections, the qualitative be-
havior of ΓCS/sT will only change by modifying the nature
of the phase transition encoded in the choice of parameters
of the dilaton potential in Eq. (3).

It is also interesting to note the saturating behavior
observed in Fig. 2 by using the coupling in Eq. (27) with
Z1 > 10. This same kind of saturation will also hold in the
cases of a second order phase transition and a crossover,
to be discussed in the sequel.

5. Model B: second order phase transition

In this section, we discuss the thermodynamics and
the behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate in a sys-
tem with a second order phase transition, which may be
modeled by the choice of parameters shown in Table 2 for

hole solutions. For φH > φc
H the pressure of the system is zero, cor-
responding to the pressure of the thermal gas solution, as discussed
before.

has been used previously in Ref. [37].

In a system with a second order phase transition, we

point where c2
s vanishes (although it must be non-negative)
[37]. In Fig. 3 (a), one notes that φH = φc
H is a stationary
inﬂection point of T (φH )/Tc. In Fig. 3 (b) and (c) we plot
the equation of state. One can see that at T = Tc, s/T 3
develops an inﬁnite slope and its temperature derivative
diverges, as usual in second order phase transitions. Also,
the trace anomaly peaks at T = Tc, while going to zero at
high temperatures (corresponding to the conformal limit).
In the present case, contrary to what happens in a
system with a ﬁrst order Hawking-Page phase transition,
the black hole solutions exist for any value of T and are
always thermodynamically favored over the thermal gas
solution (which has zero pressure).
In Fig. 4, we display our results for ΓCS/sT normal-
ized by its value at T → ∞ for diﬀerent choices of the
axion-dilaton coupling function. One notes that ΓCS/sT
has inﬁnite slope at T = Tc in a second order phase transi-
tion. Moreover, the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate grows by
orders of magnitude below the critical temperature, which
is a consequence of the exponential behavior of ΓCS/sT in
conjunction with the inverse relation φH (T ), which may
be inferred from the plot in Fig. 3 (a).

6. Model C: crossover

In this section, we discuss the thermodynamics and
the behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate in a sys-
tem with a crossover, which may be modeled by the choice
of parameters shown in Table 3 for the dilaton potential
in Eq. (3). This particular choice has been used previ-
ously in Refs. [37, 56, 57] to holographically emulate the
thermodynamic properties of SU (3) (2 + 1)-ﬂavor QCD.
In the case of a crossover, the Helmholtz free energy
density does not possess any non-analyticity, contrary to
what happens in a real phase transition (for instance, in
the ﬁrst order system analyzed before, the ﬁrst order tem-
perature derivative of the free energy jumps at T = Tc,
while in the second order system, the second order deriva-
tive diverges). Consequently, all its derivatives are smooth
and the deﬁnition of the so-called pseudo-critical tempera-
ture (which we shall denote also as “Tc”) in this case is not
unique and depends on the thermodynamic observable em-
ployed to characterize it [58]. In a crossover, even though
there is no real phase transition, the degrees of freedom
of the system rapidly change across a small temperature
interval, and some possible benchmarks9 used to charac-
terize the pseudo-critical temperature are, for instance, the
inﬂection point of s/T 3, the peak of I/T 4, or the minimum
of c2

s. Here we choose the latter one to characterize Tc.
In Fig. 5 (a), we plot T (φH )/Tc in the system with
a crossover. One notes that, as in the system with a sec-

9More precisely, these diﬀerent characteristic points may be used

to deﬁne a band for the crossover temperature.

for any value of T , but this time the inﬂection point of
T (φH )/Tc is non-stationary. In Fig. 5 (b) and (c) we plot
the equation of state, whose behavior in a crossover looks
like a “smoothed out version of the equation of state in
the system with a second order phase transition”, with
the main diﬀerences being that c2
s no longer vanishes at
T = Tc and s/T 3 has ﬁnite slope, although rapidly vary-
ing around T = Tc. Also in this case, the black hole solu-
tions are always thermodynamically favored over the zero
pressure thermal gas solution.

also found that ΓCS/sT increases by orders of magnitude
below the critical temperature in a second order phase
transition and in a crossover.
In all the cases, ΓCS/sT
increases with decreasing temperature.

Our conclusions were shown to be robust in face of the
choice of diﬀerent proﬁles for the axion-dilaton coupling
previously derived in the literature.

The behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate across
these diﬀerent phase transitions is expected to play a rele-
vant role for the CME around the QCD critical end point,
which is a second order phase transition point connecting
a crossover band to a line of ﬁrst order phase transition.

It will be also interesting to investigate the behavior of
the spectral density and the quasinormal modes in the ax-
ion channel for each of the three diﬀerent phase transitions
discussed here, which is a on-going project.

In Fig. 6, we present our results for ΓCS/sT normalized
by its value at T → ∞ for diﬀerent choices of the axion-
dilaton coupling function. One notes that ΓCS/sT behaves
smoothly, although displaying a fast variation around the
pseudo-critical temperature. As in the case of a second
order phase transition, the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate
grows by orders of magnitude below Tc in a crossover.

7. Concluding remarks

In the present work, we conducted a systematic study
of the behavior of the Chern-Simons diﬀusion rate across
diﬀerent kinds of phase transitions. By using a bottom-up
Einstein-dilaton holographic setup, we adjusted the dila-
ton potential in order to obtain diﬀerent equations of state
in the gauge theory, displaying a ﬁrst order, a second order,
or a crossover transition. As originally found in Ref. [27],
we concluded that in the case of a ﬁrst order phase transi-
tion the dimensionless ratio ΓCS/sT jumps at the critical
temperature. The new conclusions obtained in the present
work regard the behavior of ΓCS/sT across a second order
phase transition, where it diverges at the critical temper-
ature, and also its behavior through a crossover, where
it behaves smoothly, although displaying a fast variation
around the pseudo-critical temperature. Furthermore, we
