ABSTRACT

Haumea is one of the most interesting and intriguing transneptunian objects

(TNOs). It is a large, bright, fast rotator, and its spectrum indicates nearly pure

water ice on the surface.

It has at least two satellites and a dynamically re-

lated family of more than ten TNOs with very similar proper orbital parameters

and similar surface properties. The Haumean family is the only one currently

known in the transneptunian belt. Various models have been proposed but the

formation of the family remains poorly understood. In this work, we have inves-

tigated the rotational properties of the family members and unconﬁrmed family

candidates with short-term variability studies, and report the most complete re-

view to date. We present results based on ﬁve years of observations and report

the short-term variability of ﬁve family members, and seven candidates. The

mean rotational periods, from Maxwellian ﬁts to the frequency distributions, are
6.27±1.19 h for the conﬁrmed family members, 6.44±1.16 h for the candidates,
and 7.65±0.54 h for other TNOs (without relation to the family). According to

our study, there is a suggestion that Haumea family members rotate faster than

other TNOs, however, the sample of family member is still too limited for a secure

conclusion. We also highlight the fast rotation of 2002 GH32. This object has
a 0.36±0.02 mag amplitude lightcurve and a rotational period of about 3.98 h.

Assuming 2002 GH32 is a triaxial object in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a
lower limit to the density of 2.56 g cm−3. This density is similar to Haumea’s

and much more dense than other small TNO densities.

Introduction

The dwarf planet Haumea, (136108) 2003 EL61, has been well observed since its

discovery and exhibits a number of interesting and unusual characteristics:

• bright with a visual magnitude about 17.

• large with a diameter around 1200 km and a geometric albedo of 0.70-0.75 (Lellouch

et al. 2010).

• a very elongated shape and a dark spot (Lacerda et al. 2008).

• fast rotational period around 3.9 h (Rabinowitz et al. 2006; Lacerda et al. 2008;

Thirouin et al. 2010).

• high density of 2.5-3.3 g cm−3 (Rabinowitz et al. 2006; Thirouin et al. 2010).

• pure water ice surface (Trujillo et al. 2007; Merlin et al. 2007; Tegler et al. 2007).

• at least two satellites: Namaka and Hi’iaka (Brown et al. 2005; Brown 2005; Brown et

al. 2006).

• ten objects (plus Haumea and its satellites) have similar proper orbital parameters

and similar surface properties.

Noll et al. (2005) noted that three objects, (19308) 1996 TO66, (24836) 1995 SM55, and

(86047) 1999 OY3 had unusually blue colors in a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) survey of

81 TNOs using NICMOS (F110W-F160W color). The authors suggested that these unusual

colors could be due to bodies covered by relatively fresh ices. Brown et al. (2007) further

suggested that these three objects with several others had similar proper orbital parameters

and surface properties to Haumea. This lead to the idea that Haumea, its satellites, and

– 4 –

these other objects formed a family. Brown et al. (2007) proposed that the proto-Haumea1

suﬀered a catastrophic impact that ejected a large fraction of its icy mantle, which formed

the two satellites and the dynamical family. Levison et al. (2008) found that the Haumean

family is likely the only collisional family in the Trans-Neptunian belt. However, Marcus

et al. (2011) and Campo Bagatin & Benavidez (2012) have argued that there could be

more families in this region. They estimated that a collision on a 400 km body would have
produced a largest fragment not smaller than ∼300 km and fragments in the 50-100 km size

range (23-24 mag) making their identiﬁcation diﬃcult with existing surveys (e.g. Brown et

al. (2015); Sheppard et al. (2011)).

In this work, we report observations of short-term variability of Haumea family

members and candidates, including objects not previously observed. We performed CCD

photometric observations using several telescopes in Spain and the United States over a

period of ﬁve years. We report the short-term variability of twelve objects. We compare the

rotational properties of the Haumea family members to non-family transneptunian objects

(TNOs). As a test of whether the peculiar creation and history of this group of object,

may have resulted in rotational properties that are diﬀerent from those of other TNOs. We

examine also the lightcurve amplitude distribution of the family members and candidates.

Body elongation and lower limit to the density are derived from lightcurves.

This paper is divided into six sections. In the next section, we review the Haumea

family and deﬁne terminology. Then, we describe the observations and the data set

analyzed. In Section 4, we present our main results for each object. In Section 5, we discuss

our results and present a summary about the Haumea family members and candidates.

Finally, Section 6 is dedicated to the conclusions of this work.

1The term ”proto-Haumea” is used to refer to the object prior to the formation of the

family. The name ”Haumea” is used to refer to the actual object.

2. Haumea family members

The Haumea family is composed of objects sharing similar proper orbital elements and

similar surface properties (Brown et al. 2007). Currently, the list of conﬁrmed Haumea

family members is:

• Brown et al. (2007) identiﬁed (24835) 1995 SM55, (19308) 1996 TO66, (55636)

2002 TX300, (120178) 2003 OP32, (145453) 2005 RR43, (136108) Haumea, Namaka,

and Hi’iaka.

• Ragozzine & Brown (2007) added (86047) 1999 OY3, and 2003 UZ117.

• Schaller & Brown (2008) added (308193) 2005 CB79.

• Snodgrass et al. (2010) included 2003 SQ317

2.

• Trujillo et al. (2011) conﬁrmed the membership of 2009 YE7.

Ragozzine & Brown (2007) published a list of possible family members (hereinafter,

candidates) that have proper orbital elements consistent with the family but without any

near infrared spectra conﬁrming the presence of water ice on their surfaces (see Ragozzine

& Brown (2007) for a more complete deﬁnition of the candidate sample). Some of these

candidates have been rejected by Snodgrass et al. (2010), and Carry et al. (2012) based

2Snodgrass et al. (2010) considered this object only as a probable member due to the lack

of optical colors and relatively large uncertainty on their (J-HS) value (see Snodgrass et al.

(2010) for more details). Therefore, the water ice detection is only preliminary. According

to Lacerda et al. (2014), this object has a nearly solar surface colour matching colours of

the other members, but its phase function is much steeper. In order to provide the most

complete study, we will consider this object as member.

– 6 –

on colour studies. Recently, Sheppard and Trujillo discovered another candidate in their

survey dedicated to the search of Sedna-like objects (Trujillo & Sheppard 2014; Sheppard

& Trujillo 2015). This object, 2014 FT71, has proper orbital elements consistent with

Haumea’s, but color/spectroscopic observations needed to conﬁrm family membership are

lacking (Sheppard & Trujillo 2015).

Volk & Malhotra (2012) suggested that (315530) 2008 AP129 belongs to a new class of

rockier family members. This object has proper elements consistent with being a member

of the family but does not have a strong water ice signature (Brown et al. 2012). Volk &

Malhotra (2012) speculated that this object could be a fragment from an inner part of a

diﬀerentiated proto-Haumea. On the other hand, Cook et al. (2011) based on Desch et al.

(2009) work suggested that the proto-Haumea was only partially diﬀerentiated. In fact,

Desch et al. (2009) showed that TNOs with radii in the range 500-1000 km are only partially

diﬀerentiated with a rocky core and an icy mantle surrounded by a thick crust of rock/ice

mixture. Such a crust never reached temperatures high enough to melt or diﬀerentiate. In

that case, the fragments forming the Haumea family are from the icy mantle and the crust,

and so, one might expect a mix of icy and rocky members in the family. As 2008 AP129

appears as a ”transition object” between the icy and rocky population, for the purpose of

this work, we will consider it as a candidate. Orcus and Pluto-Charon have also water ice

on their surface, but, because their proper orbital elements are not similar to the rest of

the family and candidates, they will not be considered in this work (Fornasier et al. 2004;

Trujillo et al. 2005; Carry et al. 2011; Cruikshank et al. 2015).

3. Observations and data reduction

3.1. Runs and Telescopes

We present data obtained with Lowell Observatory’s 4.3 m Discovery Channel Telescope

(DCT), the 3.58 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope

(INT), the 2.2 m Centro Astron´omico Hispano Alem´an (CAHA) telescope at Calar Alto

Observatory, and the 1.5 m Sierra Nevada Observatory (OSN) telescope between 2011 and

2015.

The DCT is forty miles southeast of Flagstaﬀ at the Happy Jack site (Arizona, United

States of America). Images were obtained using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) which
is a 6144×6160 CCD. The total ﬁeld of view is 12.5(cid:48)×12.5(cid:48) with a pixel scale of 0.12(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel
(unbinned). Images were obtained using the 3×3 binning mode.

The TNG and INT are located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma,

Canary Islands, Spain). Images were obtained using the Device Optimized for the LOw

RESolution instrument (DOLORES or LRS). This device has a camera and a spectrograph
installed at the Nasmyth B telescope focus. We observed in imaging mode and a 2×2

binning mode. The camera is equipped with a 2048x2048 CCD with a pixel size of 13.5µm.
The ﬁeld of view is 8.6(cid:48)×8.6(cid:48) with a 0.252(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel scale (pixel scale for a 1×1 binning). Our

observations with the INT were obtained with the Wide Field Camera (WFC) instrument.
This camera consists of 4 thinned EEV 2154×4200 CCDs for a total ﬁeld of view of 34(cid:48)×34(cid:48).
The pixel scale is 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel (pixel scale for a 1×1 binning).

The 2.2 m CAHA telescope at Calar Alto Observatory is located in the Sierra de Los

Filabres (Almeria, Spain). We used the Calar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph (CAFOS)

instrument located at the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. CAFOS is equipped with a
2048×2048 pixels CCD and the image scale is 0.53(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel (pixel scale for a 1×1 binning).

Images were obtained using 2×2 binning.

– 8 –

The 1.5 m telescope is located at the Observatory of Sierra Nevada (OSN), at Loma de

Dilar in the National Park of Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain). Observations were carried
out by means of a 2k×2k CCD, with a total ﬁeld of view of 7.8(cid:48)×7.8(cid:48). We used a 2×2
binning mode, which changes the image scale to 0.46(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel.

3.2. Observing strategy, Data reduction and analysis

Exposure times were chosen based on two main factors: i) exposure time had to be

long enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) suﬃcient to study the observed object

(typically, S/N>20); ii) exposure time had to be short enough to avoid elongated images.

We always tracked the telescope at sidereal speed. The drift rates of TNOs are low,
typically ∼2(cid:48)(cid:48)/h, so exposure times around 200 to 900 seconds were used.

Observations at the OSN were performed without ﬁlter in order to maximize the S/N.

As the main goal of our study is short-term variability via relative photometry, the use of

unﬁltered images without absolute calibration is not a problem. The r’ Sloan ﬁlter was

used during our observations with the TNG. With the 2.2 m CAHA telescope, we used the

Schott KG1 ﬁlter (near-infrared blocking ﬁlter), and the VR ﬁlter (broad-band ﬁlter) at the

DCT. Such ﬁlters were chosen to maximize the object S/N and to minimize the fringing

that appears at longer wavelengths in these instruments.

In this work, we focused on ﬁve conﬁrmed members of the family: 1995 SM55,

1999 OY3, 2003 OP32, 2003 UZ117, and 2009 YE7, and seven candidates: 1999 CD158,

2000 CG105, 2002 GH32, 2003 HA57, 2003 HX56, 2005 GE187, and 2008 AP129. All relevant

geometric information about the observed objects at the date of observation, the number of

images and ﬁlters are summarized in Table 1.

– 9 –

We used the standard data calibration and reduction techniques described in Thirouin

et al. (2010, 2012, 2014).

3.3. Period-detection methods

The time-series photometry of each target was inspected for periodicities by means of

the Lomb technique (Lomb 1976) as implemented in Press et al. (1992). We also checked

our results with several other time-series analysis techniques, such as Phase Dispersion

Minimization (PDM) (Stellingwerf 1978), and CLEAN technique (Foster 1995). Harris

et al. (1989) method and its improvement (Pravec et al. 1996) was also used (hereinafter

Pravec-Harris method). Finally, in order to measure the full amplitude (or peak-to-peak

amplitude) of short-term variability, a ﬁrst or second order Fourier ﬁt (depending if we

are considering a single- or double-peaked rotational periodicity) to the data has been

performed.

We must point out that to distinguish between shape and/or albedo contribution(s)

in a lightcurve is not trivial. In fact, care has to be taken to distinguish between a single-

or double-peaked lightcurve (see Fig 1 and discussion related in Thirouin et al. (2014)).

Except for a pole-on view of an object, in which no rotational variability can be observed,

the observer will detect rotational variability for the rest of conﬁgurations of the spin axis.

Assuming a triaxial ellipsoid (Jacobi ellipsoid), we have to expect a lightcurve with two

maxima and two minima, corresponding to a full rotation (a double-peaked lightcurve).

However, if the object is spherical or oblate (MacLaurin spheroid) without any albedo

variation on its surface, we have to expect a ﬂat lightcurve. If this spheroid presents

albedo variation on its surface, we have to expect a lightcurve with one maximum and one

minimum (i.e., a single-peaked lightcurve).

– 10 –

When the lightcurve amplitude is small, it is very diﬃcult or even impossible to

distinguish if the lightcurve is single- or double-peaked. Therefore, we have to ﬁnd a

criterion to distinguish between both cases. In Thirouin et al. (2010); Duﬀard et al.

(2009), we proposed a threshold at 0.15 mag to distinguish between shape and albedo

eﬀects. This criterion is a simpliﬁcation because there may be elongated objects whose

rotational variability is smaller than 0.15 mag simply because their rotation axes are viewed

close to pole-on from Earth. However, these objects are only a small fraction because

statistically only very few objects have spin axes near the pole-on orientation3. In Thirouin

(2013), we tested what is the lightcurve amplitude limit to distinguish between shape-

and albedo-dominated lighcurves (i.e. to distinguish between single- and double-peaked

lighcurves). We tested three lightcurve amplitude limits: i) a threshold at 0.10 mag, ii) at

0.15 mag, and iii) at 0.20 mag, to distinguish between single- and double-peaked lightcurves.

The best ﬁt (i.e. with the highest conﬁdence level) has been obtained considering a

lightcurve amplitude limit of 0.15 mag. Such a criterion with a threshold at 0.15 mag has

been used already by several investigators as the transition from low to medium variability

(Lacerda & Luu 2006; Sheppard et al. 2008). In the asteroid case, albedo variations are

usually responsible for lightcurve amplitudes between 0.1 mag and 0.2 mag (Magnusson

1991; Lupishko et al. 1983; Degewij et al. 1979).

Albedo variation in the asteroid modeling is negligible but not in the TNO case. The

shape dominates in the asteroid case, but not for the TNOs (Lacerda et al. 2008). Lacerda

3In case of pole-on observation, even if the object is very elongated, lightcurve will be

ﬂat. However, the probability of such a case is low. In fact, Equation 6a of Lacerda & Luu

(2003) estimates the probability to observe an object with a pole-on orientation. Assuming
an angle θ=5◦, the probability to see an object with a pole-on orientation±5◦ is less than

1 %.

– 11 –

et al. (2008) simulated a synthetic ellipsoidal object without any mark of albedo on its

surface, and the result is a perfectly symmetric double-peaked lightcurve. But if a spot

or a hemispheric albedo variation is present on the surface of the same ellipsoidal object,

the result is an asymmetric double-peaked lightcurve. In other words, the double-peaked

lightcurve is due to the shape of the object, and it is clear that the asymmetry of the

maxima is due to the spot/hemispheric albedo variation. So, the diﬀerence between both

maxima (and both minima) gives us information about the albedo variation on the object’s

surface. In the case of Haumea, such a diﬀerence between both maxima is around 0.04 mag

(or 4%), and there is also a diﬀerence between both minima of around 0.04 mag (Lacerda

et al. 2008). Therefore, the total change can amount to 0.08 mag. Haumea is not the only

TNO presenting such a characteristic. We can cite: i) Varuna with a diﬀerence around

0.1 mag (10%) (Thirouin et al. (2010); Thirouin (2013), and Ortiz et al. In prep), ii)

2003 VS2 also presents an asymmetric lightcurve with a 0.04 mag diﬀerence (Thirouin et

al. 2010; Sheppard 2007; Ortiz et al. 2006). The observed asymmetric lightcurves can be

perfectly explained thanks to the lightcurve modeling of objects with spot or hemispheric

albedo variations reported by Lacerda et al. (2008) (Lellouch et al. 2010; Snodgrass et al.

2010; Carry et al. 2012; Lockwood et al. 2014). Besides these cases, there is an even more

well known case: Pluto. Pluto is a MacLaurin body whose lightcurve is exclusively due

to albedo variations on its surface. In conclusion, based on the typical hemispherically

averaged albedo, and the best Maxwellian ﬁt distribution (Thirouin 2013), we estimate that

0.15 mag is a good measure of the typical variability caused by albedo features. On the

other hand, we know that lightcurve amplitude of large and small TNOs are signiﬁcantly

diﬀerent (Lacerda & Luu 2003, 2006). These authors, based on numerical and observations
evidence, noticed a cut-oﬀ for objects with a diameter ∼400 km (with an albedo of 0.04).

They demonstrated that large objects have nearly spherical shapes and small objects have

irregular shapes. Based on a larger sample and using an albedo of 0.12, this cut-oﬀ is closer

– 12 –

to ∼250-300 km (Vilenius et al. 2012, 2014). From observations and numerical simulations,

we can conclude that objects with a diameter larger than 250-350 km (conservative cut-oﬀ)

are spherical whereas smaller objects have an elongated shape (Duﬀard et al. 2009; Lacerda

& Luu 2006, 2003; Leinhardt et al. 2000). In case of asymmetric lightcurve, we always

chose the double-peaked option because it clearly shows a complex shape and/or surface

variations that cannot be explained with a single-peaked lightcurve.

4. Photometric results

In this section, we discuss our short-term variability results. We report new data

for eleven objects. For one object we present a new analysis of previously published

results by our team plus additional data we obtained. For the ﬁrst time, rotational

periods and lightcurve amplitude are reported for the entire family (except Haumea’s

satellites). To present a complete study, we also focus on several candidates. Observations

of candidates are challenging because these objects are small and faint. Only a few attempts

of short-term variability of faint objects have been published (e.g. Trilling & Bernstein

(2006); Kern (2006); Kern & Elliot (2006)). HST is the most proliﬁc tool to study these

faint objects, however, thanks to 4 m class telescope, we reached objects with a visual

magnitude up to 24 (faintest objects observed under excellent weather and seeing conditions).

Lomb periodograms and lightcurves for all objects are provided in Figure 1 to Figure

20. We plotted all lightcurves over two cycles (rotational phase from 0 to 2) for better

visualization of the cyclical variation. For each lightcurve, a ﬁrst or second order Fourier

series is used to ﬁt the photometric data. Error bars for the measurements are not shown on

the plots for clarity but one-sigma error bars on the relative magnitudes are reported in the

supplementary material (see Table 2). We must point out that when we combined several

– 13 –

observing runs obtained at diﬀerent epochs, light time correction of the data is required

(see Thirouin (2013) for more details about data combination). Our photometric results

are reported in Table 4. A complete summary of the short-term variability of the Haumea

family members and candidates can be found in Table 3.

4.1.

(24835) 1995 SM55

Sheppard & Jewitt (2003) observed this object for several nights on October and

November 2001 with the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope. Based on the October

data set, they reported a scattered photometry and no rotational period estimation. With

the additional November data set, they suggested a single-peaked rotational period of

4.04 h or a double-peaked periodicity of 8.08 h and an average peak-to-peak amplitude
of 0.19±0.05 mag (they only reported photometric amplitude estimated from apparent

maximum and minimum, and not lightcurve amplitude obtained thanks to a lightcurve

ﬁt as it has been done in this work). Unfortunately, in both cases, the curves were too

noisy given the photometric uncertainties. Sheppard & Jewitt (2003) concluded that the

amplitude of the lightcurve may be variable from night to night. Such variations could be

due to: i) the presence of a companion, ii) cometary activity, or iii) complex rotational

state. Sheppard & Jewitt (2003) pointed out that this object has been investigated for
binarity with the Hubble Space Telescope and that no satellite with a separation ≥0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)
and having a magnitude diﬀerence ≤2.5 was found. 1995 SM55 is one of the bluest TNOs
which could be attributed to recent excavation (due to a collision, for example) of its

volatile-rich interior (Hainaut & Delsanti 2002). On the other hand, the lightcurve ampli-

tude may be due to freshly exposed material by cometary activity (Hainaut & Delsanti 2002).

This object was observed in 2012, and 2013 to look for a possible change in the

– 14 –

lightcurve. By merging our data with Sheppard & Jewitt (2003) data, the Lomb periodogram

plotted in Figure 1 is obtained. The main peak is located at 5.94 cycles/day (4.04 h), and

there are two other peaks with a lower spectral power located at 5.04 cycles/day, and at

6.94 cycles/day. The lightcurve is asymmetric with a ﬁrst peak taller than the second one,

and a second minimum deeper than the ﬁrst one, so the double-peaked lightcurve with a

rotational period of 8.08 h seems the best option. In Figure 2 is plotted the corresponding
double-peaked lightcurve with a lightcurve amplitude of 0.04±0.02 mag. A second argument
in favor of the double-peaked lightcurve is the goodness of the ﬁt based on a reduced χ2

test (χ2=1.496 for the double-peaked option and χ2=1.510 for the single-peaked one). We

also tested higher harmonics, but the χ2 test discarded all of them.

In conclusion, we conﬁrmed the rotational period obtained by Sheppard & Jewitt

(2003), as well as the lightcurve amplitude. We also report no signiﬁcant change for this

lightcurve over twelve years. Lightcurve reported by Sheppard & Jewitt (2003), as well as

our new lightcurve are noisy despite the high data quality. Possible explanations for such a

lightcurve will be studied in a future work.

4.2.

(86047) 1999 OY3

We report the ﬁrst attempt of short-term variability study for this object. We observed

1999 OY3 during several nights in 2015 with the DCT. We report two long observing blocks

of about 6 h and several shorter blocks. Techniques used to derive the object rotation

favored a periodicity around 9 h. Figure 3 showed one main peak at 2.66 cycles/day.

Peaks around 4 cycles/day are consistent with the duration of our longer observing runs

and so are not due to the object rotation. We obtained a single-peaked period of 9.01 h

(Figure 4, plot a)) and a double-peaked periodicity of 18.02 h (Figure 4, plot b)). We

favored the double-peaked option because minima/maxima are diﬀerent by about 0.02 mag,

– 15 –

and because the χ2 of the single-peaked ﬁt is 1.633 whereas the double-peaked is 1.548.

Considering the double-peaked option, we found a χ2=1.346 for the eighth harmonic.

However, due to our data quality, we are not conﬁdent about this result. Only more data

will conﬁrm or not such a possible harmonic.

4.3.

(120178) 2003 OP32

Rabinowitz et al. (2008) presented 78 R-band observations of 2003 OP32 obtained

in 2006 with the 1.3 m SMARTS telescope. They proposed a single-peaked lightcurve

with a periodicity of 4.845 h and an amplitude of 0.26 mag. Thirouin et al. (2010)

also observed 2003 OP32 during several runs between 2005 and 2007, and proposed a

single-peaked lightcurve with a rotational period of 4.05 h and an amplitude peak-to-peak
of 0.13±0.01 mag. Benecchi & Sheppard (2013) observed 2003 OP32, during 6 nights with
the Ir´en´ee du Pont 2.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile). They favored a

single-peaked rotational period of 4.85 h or a double-peaked rotational period of 9.71 h.
Their peak-to-peak lightcurve amplitude is 0.18±0.01 mag.

2003 OP32 has been re-observed on 2011 and 2013 with the 2.2 m CAHA and the 1.5 m

OSN telescopes. The Lomb periodogram of our 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, and Benecchi &

Sheppard (2013) data sets altogether shows one peak located at 4.95 cycles/day (4.85 h) and

two aliases located at 3.96 cycles/day (6.07 h) and at 5.96 cycles/day (4.03 h) (Figure 5). All

techniques conﬁrm a periodic signature at 4.85 h with high spectral power. In Figure 6, the
corresponding single-peaked lightcurve with an amplitude of 0.14±0.02 mag is plotted. In

conclusion, our and Benecchi & Sheppard (2013) results completely ruled out the possibility

of a large amplitude lightcurve noted by Rabinowitz et al. (2008), and there is an agreement

about the single-peaked periodicity of 4.85 h. Though we cannot rule out the double-peaked

lightcurve, we favored the single-peaked option for this object for several reasons: i) the

– 16 –

moderate lightcurve amplitude suggests albedo variation on the object’s surface and not

elongated shape behavior, ii) the lightcurve is symmetric, iii) because of the size of this

object, it is more likely that it is a MacLaurin spheroidal object (see Section 3.3 for more de-

tails), and iv) χ2=1.559 for the single-peaked lightcurve and χ2=1.616 for the double-peaked.

4.4. 2003 UZ117

Using the EMMI instrument installed at the New Technology Telescope of the

European Southern Observatory (ESO), Perna et al. (2009) observed this object for ∼10.5 h

during 2 nights on December 2007. As they mentioned, data points were not good enough

to ﬁnd an unambiguous rotational period. They suggested a rotational period of about 6 h.

We observed 2003 UZ117 during one night with the DCT on November 2014. Based

on our DCT data, we obtained a single-peaked period of 5.30 h (Figure 7, plot a)) and

a double-peaked periodicity of 10.61 h (Figure 7, plot b)). Using the ESO archive4, we

downloaded and re-reduced the images obtained by Perna et al. (2009). By merging both

data-sets reduced and analyzed the same way, we derived a double-peaked periodicity of

11.29 h (Figure 8). We favored the double-peaked option based on the fact that one of the

minima is deeper than the other one and one of the maxima is taller than the other one
(∼0.01-0.02 mag). In Figure 7 (plot c)) is plotted the corresponding lightcurve with an
amplitude of 0.09±0.01 mag. We must point out that the rotational period of about 5.64 h

was also an option based on our DCT data, but with a lower conﬁdence level than the

5.30 h option. We calculated a χ2 of 1.246 for the second harmonic and 1.104 for the sixth

harmonic. However, such a higher harmonic was only favored because Perna et al. (2009)

4Data can be downloaded at http : //archive.eso.org

– 17 –

data have a higher dispersion than our data. Therefore, we discarded this harmonic.

4.5.

(386723) 2009 YE7

Benecchi & Sheppard (2013) observed 2009 YE7 during 4 nights using the 2.5 m Ir´en´ee

du Pont telescope located at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile). They concluded that this

object has a lightcurve amplitude < 0.2 mag and they were not able to favor a rotational

period based on their dataset.

We observed this object during one night with the DCT in November 2014 under

variable weather conditions. Based on our data-set, we derived a possible single-peaked

lightcurve with a rotational period of about 5.5 h. By merging our sample and Benecchi &

Sheppard (2013) data, we obtained a single-peaked periodicity of 5.65 h (Figure 9). The
lightcurve amplitude is 0.06±0.02 mag (Figure 10). Goodness of the ﬁt is χ2=1.759 for the
single-peaked lightcurve and χ2=2.005 for the double-peaked lightcurve. Based on the χ2

value the single-peaked option is favored. Though we cannot rule out the double-peaked

lightcurve, the small lightcurve amplitude is compatible with albedo variation, and so we

infer a single-peaked lightcurve (Duﬀard et al. 2009; Thirouin et al. 2010).

4.6.

(315530) 2008 AP129

2008 AP129 did not previously have an observed lightcurve. We observed this object

during a run in January 2012, in poor atmospheric conditions, and during two more

runs in February 2013 with the 3.58 m TNG and the 1.5 m OSN telescope. The Lomb

periodogram of our 2012 and 2013 data sets (Figure 11) shows one main peak located

at 9.04 h (2.65 cycles/day) and the second one with a lower spectral power is located at

3.84 cycles/day (6.25 h). PDM, CLEAN, and Pravec-Harris techniques conﬁrmed these

– 18 –

two peaks with a higher spectral power for the 9.04 h rotational period. In Figure 12, the

corresponding lightcurve using a rotational periodicity of 9.04 h is plotted. The amplitude
of the curve is 0.12±0.02 mag. In summary, 9.04 h is preferred but 6.25 h is also a possible

period. In both cases, we preferred the single-peaked periodicity because of the small

lightcurve amplitude, as well as the symmetric lightcurve and the potentially large size

of this object. The goodness of the ﬁt is χ2=1.539 for the single-peaked lightcurve and

χ2=1.571 in the case of the double-peaked option. Therefore, the single-peaked lightcurve

seems to be the best option, but the double-peaked option is not ruled out. Based on

the data quality (data obtained under poor weather condition), we do not favor higher

harmonics. Only more data will allow us to check if higher harmonics have to be considered.

4.7. 1999 CD158

1999 CD158 has not been previously observed for short-term variability. We observed

this object during one night in March 2015 with the DCT. We derived a single-peaked

period of 3.55 h and a double-peaked periodicity of 7.1 h. Lomb periodogram and other

techniques conﬁrmed this periodicity (Figure 13). We favored the double-peaked option

based on the large lightcurve amplitude. In Figure 14 (Plot a)) is plotted the corresponding
lightcurve with an amplitude of 0.51±0.03 mag. Snodgrass et al. (2010) observed this object

in 2008 using the 3.6 m New Technology telescope (NTT) located at La Silla Observatory

(Chile). The main purpose of their work was to derive BVRI colors, and their data are

not entirely suitable for lightcurve study (see Snodgrass et al. (2010) for more details and

observing circumstances). Thanks to the ESO archive, we downloaded and re-reduced

images obtained by Snodgrass et al. (2010). By merging our sample and their R-data, we

obtained a single-peaked periodicity of 3.44 h (Figure 13). Based on the large lightcurve
amplitude (∆m = 0.49±0.03 mag) and the asymmetric peaks, we favored the double-peaked

– 19 –

periodicity of 6.88 h (Figure 14, plot b)). The best ﬁt was obtain for the double-peaked

lightcurve, and so our result is conﬁrmed.

4.8. 2000 CG105

2000 CG105 was observed only one night in 2015 with the DCT. From about 2 h

of observations, we report a 0.2 mag amplitude variation. We searched for a rotational

periodicity but, unfortunately, with only few observational hours, we are not able to propose

a reliable rotational-period estimation. We try to merge our data with R-band images from

Snodgrass et al. (2010), but we are not able to derive a secure rotational period. However,

based on Snodgrass et al. (2010) and our data, we can conﬁrm the large variability of this

object.

4.9. 2002 GH32

2002 GH32 has not been observed for a lightcurve before. We observed this object

during one night in March and one night in April 2015 with the DCT. We obtained a

single-peaked period of 1.99 h. Lomb periodogram and other techniques conﬁrmed such

a periodicity (Figure 15). However, the lightcurve is asymmetric and so, we favored a

double-peaked periodicity of 3.98 h. In Figure 16 is plotted the corresponding lightcurve
with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.36±0.02 mag. Harris et al. (2014) noticed that

the fourth harmonic is potentially the primary harmonic for asteroid with a lightcurve
dominated by shape and an amplitude up to ∼0.38 mag. Assuming the second harmonic,
the goodness of the ﬁt is χ2=1.310, whereas the fourth harmmonic has χ2=1.339. In

conclusion, the second harmonic is favored. The ﬁrst minimum of the curve is deeper
than the second one by ∼0.08 mag. Such a lightcurve suggests that this object has a very

– 20 –

elongated shape. In addition to similarities with Haumea, it is also interesting to point out

that this object is the second fastest rotator in the Trans-neptunian belt after Haumea.

4.10.

2003 HA57

We observed 2003 HA57 during two consecutive nights in March 2015 and one night

in May 2015 with the DCT. We derived a single-peaked lightcurve with a rotational

period of 3.22 h (Figure 17). All techniques conﬁrmed such a periodicity. However, due

to the large amplitude, such a curve is probably shape-dominated and so, we have to

consider a double-peaked periodicity of 6.44 h. In Figure 18 are plotted the single- and

double-peaked options (plot a) and b) respectively). We report an amplitude peak-to-peak
of 0.31±0.03 mag. The χ2 value is 1.486 for the second harmonic. We also tested the

goodness of the ﬁt considering higher harmonics, but none of them are favored based on

our data.

4.11.

2003 HX56

We observe this object ∼4 h during one night with DCT. With only few images we are

not able to derive a secure rotational period. However, several constraints can be reported.

We found a lightcurve amplitude higher than 0.4 mag and a rotational period higher than

5 h. Based on the large amplitude, we may have to consider a double-peaked lightcurve

(rotational period higher than 10 h). 2003 HX56 has not been observed for short-term

variability before and so, more data are needed to complete this lightcurve.

– 21 –

4.12.

2005 GE187

Snodgrass et al. (2010) observed 2005 GE187 in 2008 using the 3.6 m New Technology

telescope (NTT) located at La Silla Observatory (Chile). Besides the fact that their main

goal was to obtain BVRI colors, they noted that a single-peaked lightcurve with a period of

6.1 h and an amplitude of 0.5 mag seemed reasonably convincing for this object.

We observed this object during one night with the DCT on April 2015 under very poor

seeing conditions. Based on our data-set, we derived a possible single-peaked lightcurve

with a rotational period of 5.57 h and a lightcurve amplitude of 0.31 mag. We decided

to take advantage of R-ﬁlter data from Snodgrass et al. (2010) and include them in our

study. Using the ESO archive, we downloaded and re-reduced their images. By merging

our sample and Snodgrass et al. (2010) R-data, we obtained a single-peaked periodicity of
5.99 h (Figure 19). Based on the large lightcurve amplitude (∆m = 0.29±0.02 mag) and

the asymmetric peaks, such a curve is probably shape-dominated and therefore, we favored

the double-peaked rotational period of 11.99 h (Figure 20). For this object, we calculated

a χ2 of 1.697 for the double-peaked lightcurve and χ2=1.959 for the single-peaked option.

In conclusion, based on our data-set the best lightcurve is the double-peaked lightcurve.

Higher harmonics have been considered but all of them have been discarded based on our

data.

5. Rotational properties and derived parameters

Here, we report lightcurves for all the family members (except Haumea’s satellites).

Despite studying the most complete sample to date, the Haumea family is only currently

known to have eleven objects, therefore, results presented here are preliminary.

– 22 –

5.1. Rotational period distributions

In the asteroid belt, members of dynamical families are thought to be fragments of

collisions that could inﬂuence the spin properties of the family members (Paolicchi et al.

2002). If one assumes that the Haumea family is the result of a collision, one might expect

the rotational properties of the family to be diﬀerent from other TNOs.

In Figure 21 are plotted all the TNOs with a known rotational period and we

highlighted the Haumea family members and candidates. A running mean is also

reported for all samples considered. Other TNO and candidate samples exhibit

a mostly ﬂat running mean, therefore there is not a clear tendency between size and

rotational period. But, smaller family members tend to spin slower than the larger members.

We noticed a tendency between size and rotational period for the Haumea family

members suggesting that the smaller members of the family rotate slower than the biggest

ones. With a signiﬁcance level of 98.43%, and the Spearman coeﬃcient of 0.638, there

is a strong evidence of correlation between absolute magnitude and rotational period for

the family members (see Section 5.5). We also tested the probability that the family

members and other TNOs are from the same distribution using the 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov

test (KS test). The KS test estimates the maximum deviation between the cumulative

distribution of both datasets to test the similarity (or not) between the two distributions

(Df). Signiﬁcance level of the KS test is a value between 0 and 1. Small values show that

the cumulative distribution of the ﬁrst dataset is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the second

dataset. Considering two samples made of the family members and the other TNOs, we

obtained a value of Df=0.54, and a signiﬁcance level of 0.004, indicating that the rotational

periods of the family are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. In Figure 22, rotational frequency of the

family members and candidates are plotted (data from this work and the literature). The

– 23 –

Maxwellian ﬁts5 to the family sample gives a mean rotational period of 6.27±1.19 h,
whereas the candidates have a mean rotational period of 6.57±1.14 h 6. In Figure 23 are

plotted several samples without the family members and with/without the candidates, and

the binary population 7. Maxwellian ﬁt to the other TNOs sample gives a mean rotational
period 8.98±0.77 h. In Table 5 are reported the mean rotational periods from Maxwellian

ﬁts as well as average and median for several samples including/excluding the family

members or the candidates. Standard error and standard deviation are indicated for all the

samples. Without considering the error bars, average and median rotational periods of the

family members indicate that the objects in relation with Haumea seem to rotate faster

than the other TNOs. But, because of the large error bars regarding the family sample,

such a tendency may not be true.

Regarding the candidate sample, we found no evidence of correlation between absolute

magnitude and rotational period. Running mean suggests a ﬂat distribution similar to the

one for the other TNOs sample. Maxwellian ﬁt to the candidate sample favors a mean

rotational period comparable to the family (but large error bars have to be considered).

The candidate sample may be ”contaminated” by icy members of the family yet to be

identify, as well as objects without relation with the Haumea family. Despite the fact that

2008 AP129 is not a conﬁrmed member of the family, it follows the tendency between size

and rotational period as the rest of the family.

5We used Maxwellian ﬁts based on Salo (1987) and Binzel et al. (1989) works.
6Mean rotational rate in cycles/day, Ω, is (8/π)0.5 × σ where σ is the width of the

distribution.

7We have shown that the rotational properties of the binary population are diﬀerent from

the non-binary one and so, we removed the binary population in some samples Thirouin et

al. (2014).

– 24 –

Several families have been identiﬁed and studied in the Main Belt of asteroids. Based

on the Koronis and Eos family studies, the largest fragments of the families appear to have

relatively similar rotation rates (Binzel et al. 1989). In other words, the largest fragments

”remember” the spin rate of their parent body. The largest8 members of the family are
Haumea, 2002 TX300, and 2003 OP32 with rotational periods between ∼4 h and ∼8 h. The
lightcurve of 2002 TX300 is very ﬂat and thus the rotational period may have signiﬁcant

uncertainty (Sheppard & Jewitt 2003; Ortiz et al. 2004; Thirouin et al. 2010, 2012). If

2003 OP32 has a single-peaked lightcurve then two of the three largest members of the

family, Haumea and 2003 OP32 are also the fastest rotators of the family. If the largest

fragments of the family remember the spin rate of their parent body, we can conclude that

the proto-Haumea was also a fast rotator with an elongated shape due to its rotation.

We emphasize that a catastrophic collision is not able to create a fast-spinning elongated

object. In fact, Leinhardt et al. (2010) simulated a catastrophic collision with exactly

the same parameters proposed by Brown et al. (2007). The results of their simulations

show that the largest remnant is bigger than the current Haumea, and such a catastrophic

collision produced a slow rotator with a rotational period of 28 h, far from the 3.92 h period

of the current Haumea. Similar conclusion regarding the slow rotation has been obtained

by Takeda & Ohtsuki (2009). Numerical simulations of catastrophic disruptions with

enough resolution to resolve the shape of the largest remnant produce spherical objects, not

fast-spinning elongated remnants (Leinhardt et al. 2000; Leinhardt & Stewart 2009).

8Haumea family member sizes have large uncertainty mainly because albedo is only known

for two objects (see Table 7), and so we use here the absolute magnitude to report the largest

fragments.

– 25 –

Some experiments have focused on the rotation of fragments in catastrophic impacts for

scenarios relevant to asteroid-like objects (Fujiwara & Tsukamoto 1981). They performed

catastrophic destruction of basalt targets by impacts of high-velocity projectiles. The

rotational periods of the ejected fragments were measured as a function of particle size.

Review of catastrophic disruption experiments using a wider range of materials has been

reported by Martelli et al. (1994). Both publications reported that the general tendency is

that the smaller fragments have shorter rotational period than the bigger ones. Obviously,

the size range of the fragments as well as the target composition are diﬀerent for the

Haumea case. But, if the relation noticed by Fujiwara & Tsukamoto (1981); Martelli et al.

(1994) is independent of size and composition, one could suggest that the Haumea family

was not formed during a catastrophic collision. In conclusion, there is no clear explanation

yet about such a relation between size and rotational period in the Haumea family.

5.2. Lightcurve amplitude distributions

In Figure 24, we focused on the lightcurve amplitude distributions for objects

with/without relation with Haumea. Only two members of the family present a large

lightcurve amplitude, Haumea and 2003 SQ317, and maybe 1996 TO66. The mean lightcurve

amplitude for the conﬁrmed members is 0.19 mag, and only 0.12 mag without the contact

binary, 2003 SQ317. So, most of the family members have a low lightcurve amplitude

and thus should be considered as spherical (or nearly spherical) objects also known as

MacLaurin spheroids. On the other hand, the candidates have larger lightcurve amplitude

with a mean lightcurve amplitude of 0.20 mag. Such a mean value increases up to 0.28 mag

if we only consider the smallest candidates with an absolute magnitude higher than 5.

Objects with a large lightcurve amplitude have an elongated shape and are usually named

Jacobi ellipsoids. This tendency has been already reported in the other TNOs sample

– 26 –

(Duﬀard et al. 2009; Thirouin et al. 2012, 2014). In fact, smaller objects tend to have higher

lightcurve amplitude (Figure 21). Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that the candidates

(i.e the smallest objects) have higher lightcurve amplitude. However, we cannot totally

discard that such a tendency has some connection to the formation of the Haumea family

(assuming that the candidates are members of the family).

5.3. Size, and density

According to Binzel et al. (1989), if we assume TNOs as triaxial ellipsoids with axes

a>b>c and rotating along the c-axis, the lightcurve amplitude (∆m) varies as a function of

the observational (or viewing) angle ξ as:

(cid:16)a

b

∆m = 2.5 log

(cid:17) − 1.25 log

(cid:18) a2 cos2 ξ + c2 sin2 ξ

(cid:19)

b2 cos2 ξ + c2 sin2 ξ

(1)

The lower limit for the object elongation (a/b) is obtained assuming an equatorial view
(ξ=90◦). For a random distribution of spin vectors, the probability of viewing an object on
the angle range [ξ, ξ+dξ] is proportional to sin(ξ)dξ. The average viewing angle is ξ=60◦
(Sheppard 2004). We will consider viewing angles of 60◦ and 90◦.

According to the study of Chandrasekhar (1987) of equilibrium ﬁgures for ﬂuid bodies,

one can estimate lower limits for densities from rotational periods and the elongation of

objects. We want to point out that it is diﬃcult to estimate the size transition for an object

to be in hydrostatic equilibrium or not. Lacerda & Luu (2003, 2006) based on observational
and numerical considerations, noticed a cut-oﬀ for objects with a diameter ∼400 km

(assuming an albedo of 0.04). According to their studies, small objects have irregular

shapes whereas large ones have a nearly spherical shape. This cut-oﬀ can be interpreted as

a transition between spherical objects in hydrostatic equilibrium and rubble-pile objects.

Lacerda and Luu works were based on a limited sample of lightcurve. By including newer

– 27 –

results and assuming an albedo of 0.12 (more appropriate based on recent results), this
cut-oﬀ is closer to ∼250-300 km (Thirouin 2013; Vilenius et al. 2012, 2014). On the other

hand, Duﬀard et al. (2009), based on a simple Monte-Carlo model suggested that even small

objects of about 120 km are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Finally, Lineweaver & Norman
(2010) derived the potato-to-sphere transition for icy body with a diameter of ∼200 km,
and ∼300 km for rocky asteroids. This means that icy objects with a diameter smaller

than about 200 km have an irregular shape whereas the biggest objects have a spherical

shape. however, they are not considering that TNOs are rubble-piles. In this work, we used

a conservative cut-oﬀ of 250-350 km for the transition between spheroidal and elongated

objects. In conclusion, TNOs in the 200 km and below that size range can be rubble-piles.

Collisional evolution models of the Transneptunian region indicate that objects in this size

range have received several collisiones on average so they are likely re-accumulated objects.

Besides, Duﬀard et al. (2009) indicated that the lightcurve statistics of small objects is

consistent with the ﬁgures of hydrostatic equlibrium.

Assuming that a given TNO is a triaxial ellipsoid (Jacobi ellipsoid) in hydrostatic

equilibrium, one can compute a lower density limit (Figure 25 and Table 6). Most of our

targets have low amplitude lightcurves (i.e.

low elongation), and their lightcurves are

probably due to albedo eﬀects. In other words, they are MacLaurin spheroids and the

study on lower limit densities cannot be applied. In fact, most of the observed objects

are far from the theoretical curves for acceptable values for the density which indicates

that those objects are likely spheroids or are not in hydrostatic equilibrium (Thirouin et

al. 2014). Only a few members have a high amplitude lightcurve (>0.15 mag): Haumea,
2003 SQ317, and maybe 1996 TO66. Haumea has a high density, ∼2.5 g cm−3 (Rabinowitz
et al. 2006; Thirouin et al. 2010) whereas 1996 TO66 seems to have a density higher than
1 g cm−3 (Figure 25). 2003 SQ317 is a contact binary with a density of 2.7 g cm−3 (or
0.8 g cm−3 assuming a single object, but based on the lightcurve, this object seems to be a

– 28 –

contact binary and therefore the highest density will be considered) according to Lacerda

et al. (2014). All the candidates presented here have a large lightcurve amplitude and so

can be considered as Jacobi objects. For the candidates, the range of densities varies from
0.9 to 2.6 g cm−3, and varies from 0.12 to 1.7 g cm−3 for the conﬁrmed family members.
Mean density for the members is 1.1 g cm−3 (0.7 g cm−3 without the contact binary, and
Haumea), and is 1 g cm−3 for the candidates. We want to emphasize the case of 2002 GH32.

This object is a very fast rotator with a double-peaked periodicity of 3.98 h and a lightcurve

amplitude of about 0.36 mag. The morphology of the 2002 GH32 lightcurve is similar to

Haumea’s. In fact, both objects present a fast rotation as well as an asymmetric lightcurve.

One possible interpretation of such a lightcurve is that 2002 GH32 has an elongated shape

with strong albedo variation on its surface, as it is the case for Haumea (Lacerda et al.
2008). From the lightcurve, we derived a lower limit to the density of 2.6 g cm−3 (equatorial
view) or 2.7 g cm−3 (viewing angle of 60◦).

In Figure 26, as previously noticed in Sheppard et al. (2008), the biggest objects have

higher densities than the smallest ones. Based on the family sample, an anti-correlation

with ρ=-0.391, and a low signiﬁcance level of 78.36% is found. Without the contact binary,

2003 SQ317, a reasonably strong anti-correlation with ρ=-0.733 and a signiﬁcance level of

97.33% is noticed. As pin-pointed by Lacerda et al. (2014), the contact binary presents

several atypical characteristics. To explain the lightcurve of this object, authors considered

two cases: i) ellipsoidal object (Jacobi ellipsoid), and ii) compact binary near hydrostatic

equilibrium (Roche binary). According to their models, 2003 SQ317 may have a density
between 670 and 1100 kg cm−3 considering a Jacobi object, or a density between 2050
and 3470 kg cm−3 based on a Roche model (see Lacerda et al. (2014) for more details).

Assuming that the family members are from the icy mantle of the proto-Haumea, members

would be expected to have a icy composition. The high density of the contact binary

option suggests that it must be a fragment from the rocky core of the proto-Haumea. But,

– 29 –

assuming an ellipsoidal object, the lower density indicates an icy composition. On the other

hand, visible and near-infrared colours of this object conﬁrm its membership, despite a

much steeper phase function as the other members. In conclusion, as mentioned by Lacerda

et al. (2014), both options (Jacobi ellipsoid and Roche binary) are potential options. Only

more observations over the next decade can conﬁrm one of those options. Assuming a
density of 860 kg cm−3 (i.e. Jacobi option) for 2003 SQ317, we found an anti-correlation

between density and absolute magnitude with a ρ=-0.636, and a signiﬁcance level of

95.58% corresponding to a reasonably strong anti-correlation. Regarding only the candidate

population, the trend between size and density is not evident (ρ=-0.251, signiﬁcance level

of 57.19%).

5.4. Total Haumea family mass

The mass of the family can be roughly estimated as follows. First, we computed the

diameter and the mass of each conﬁrmed member (Table 7). The diameter (D) according

to Pravec & Harris (2007), can be estimated by:

D =

10−0.2H

K√
p

where p is the geometric albedo, and H is the absolute magnitude. The constante K is:

K = 2AU × 10

Vsun

where Vsun is the visual magnitude of the Sun. Assuming that the objects are spherical,

the mass M is:

An albedo of 0.7 has been assumed for the conﬁrmed members of the family without

a known albedo. Such an estimation is reasonable because all members are believed to be

from the icy mantle of the proto-Haumea. For the candidates without a known albedo, we

used albedos of 0.08 and 0.30 to derive a range of possible sizes and masses. Based on the
masses computed and reported in Table 7, we found a total mass of 4.06×1021 kg for the
known family members (without Haumea, the total mass is 5.68×1019 kg ≈ 2%MHaumea
where MHaumea is the mass of Haumea). We did not include 2008 AP129 as a member

of the family because its membership is not conﬁrmed yet (whose contribution would be

very small). This mass estimation is obviously a lower limit because more small icy family

members (and maybe rocky members) are expected to be found. On the other hand, as

several members have no albedo reported, computed sizes indicated in Table 7 are only

estimations. A more complete review will be proposed by Vilenius et al. (In prep) in which

size and geometric albedos of several family members as well as some candidates will be

derived thanks to thermal modeling of Herschel Space Observatory data.

5.5. Correlation/anti-correlation search

We searched for correlations between physical (rotational period, and lightcurve

amplitude) and orbital parameters. We used the Spearman rank correlation (Spearman

1904) because this method is less sensitive to atypical/wrong values and does not assume

– 31 –

any population probability distribution. We computed the strength of the correlations by

calculating the Spearman coeﬃcient ρ and the signiﬁcance level (SL). The ρ coeﬃcient has

values between -1 and 1. If ρ>0, there is a possible correlation, whereas ρ<0 indicated a

possible anti-correlation and if ρ=0, there is no correlation. We consider a correlation as: i)
strong if |ρ|>0.6, ii) weak if 0.3<|ρ|<0.6, and iii) non-existent if |ρ|<0.3. The signiﬁcance

of the ρ parameter is measured by the SL: i) very strong evidence of correlation if SL>99%

(i.e. 3 σ), ii) strong evidence of correlation if SL>97.5% (i.e. 2.5 σ), and iii) reasonably

strong evidence of correlation if SL>95% (i.e. 2 σ). Such criteria have been used in several

studies of correlations/anti-correlations between colors and orbital elements, for example in

Peixinho et al. (2008, 2012, 2015).

Our search for correlations/anti-correlations is reported in Table 8. We used several

samples, such as the entire family with/without the candidates, as well as other TNOs

with/without the binary population (centaurs are not taken into account). As reported

in Thirouin et al. (2014), the binary population seems to exhibit distinct characteristics

therefore special care has been taken to remove this population We also point out that

the family and candidate samples are limited and so, care has to be taken regarding the

correlation/anti-correlation detection and interpretation. Only correlations regarding the
family and candidates with a signiﬁcance level higher than 95% and |ρ|≥0.3 are reported in

Table 8.

Rotational period versus orbital elements:

Correlations between rotational period and ascending node are only reported in several

sub-samples but seem to be a speciﬁc characteristic of the candidates pool. It is also

interesting to point out that such correlations are not presented in the other TNOs

– 32 –

populations. We also report an anti-correlation between rotational period and inclination

in the family. The most interesting and signiﬁcant correlation is between rotational period

and absolute magnitude. It seems that the biggest members of the family are rotating faster

than the smallest ones. Such a correlation is only found in the family, not in the candidate

nor other TNO pools. As mentioned in the previous section, this correlation, if real, is not

understood yet.

Ligthcurve amplitude versus orbital elements:

A well known correlation is the one between lightcurve amplitude and absolute magnitude

(Duﬀard et al. 2009; Thirouin et al. 2010). However, such a correlation is not found in the

family sample. In fact, it seems that such a feature is only reported in the other TNOs,

and candidates. Anti-correlations between lightcurve amplitude versus eccentricity and

inclination are only reported in the other TNOs samples.

6. Summary and Conclusions

We have collected photometric data for several objects related to the Haumea family

over the past ﬁve years using several facilities in Spain and United States of America. We

present an homogeneous dataset composed of twelve objects: ﬁve family members, and

seven candidates. We report rotational periods and lightcuve amplitude for most of them,

but in two cases, we only report constraints. Half of studied objects have low lightcurve

amplitudes (peak-to-peak amplitude less than 0.15 mag). Six of the twelve objects can

be considered Jacobi ellipsoids with a high lightcurve amplitude due to the shape of the

body. Some of the large amplitude lightcurves are asymmetric and such a fact can be

explained by albedo variation(s) on the surface of the objects, as it is the case with the

dark spot on Haumea’s surface. We compared the rotational frequency distributions of

– 33 –

the family members with/without candidates, and we conclude that the family members

as well as candidates seem to rotate faster than the other TNOs (objects without relation

with Haumea). We also have shown that the family members rotate at diﬀerent rates

according to their size. In fact, smaller members of the family rotate slower than the

biggest fragments. Such a tendency is yet-to-be understood and will be discussed in future

work. Rotational periods of the Haumea family members give us information about the

characteristics of the Proto-Haumea. One of the conclusions, it that the Proto-Haumea was

probably a fast rotator too and thus probably an elongated object (deformation due to the

fast rotation).

Regarding the lightcurve amplitude distribution, Haumea family members mostly show

low amplitudes, besides the case of the contact binary 2003 SQ317, and Haumea itself.

However, it is interesting to point out that most of the candidates have moderate to large

lightcurve amplitudes. Objects in relation with Haumea seem to follow the same tendency

as objects without relation with Haumea, i.e. smaller objects have higher lightcurve

amplitude thus have more irregular shapes.

From short-term variability study, we derive several physical properties such as axis

ratio, and lower limit to the density. We have shown that the mean density for the members
as well as for the candidates is around 1 g cm−3. In the family, bigger objects seem to have

higher density, except the case of the contact binary whereas such a tendency is not evident

in the candidate sample.

The deﬁnition of the Haumea family is not clear. The classic deﬁnition considers that

proper orbital elements and water ice detection are necessary to identify family members,

but the enlarged deﬁnition suggests that rocky members without (or a small amount) water

ice have to be considered too. Based on our study, it seems that the family members have

rotational properties signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the other TNOs. Therefore, such properties

– 34 –

are probably useful to identify family members.

We also report the ﬁrst lightcurve of 2002 GH32. This object presents an asymmetric

lightcurve and a very fast rotation. Our interpretation for such a lightcurve is that

2002 GH32 is a very elongated object. 2002 GH32 is the second fastest rotator in the

trans-neptunian belt, after Haumea. We report a double-peaked periodicity of 3.98 h, and a

lightcurve amplitude of 0.36 mag. Assuming this object as a triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic
equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the density of 2.6 g cm−3. Such a density is similar

to Haumea’s. We also want to emphasize the similarity of this lightcurve with Haumea’s.

In fact, both objects have similar rotational period and asymmetric lightcurve despite their

size range diﬀerence.

aUT-Dates, heliocentric (rh), and geocentric (∆) distances and

phase angle (α) of the observations are reported. We also indicate

the number of images (Nb.) obtained each night, the ﬁlter used and

the telescope (Tel.) for each observational run. ”DCT” stands for the

Discovery Channel Telescope, ”OSN” stands for the Observatory of

Sierra Nevada Telescope, ”TNG” stands for the Telescopio Nazionale

Galileo, ”INT” for Isaac Newton Telescope, and ”CAHA” stands for

the Centro Astron´omico Hispano Alem´an telescope. Some data from

others publications have been used, observational circumstances can

be ﬁnd in respective publications (see Section 4 for more details).

– 45 –

Table 2: The time series photometry of all the objects is provided in the Center of astro-

nomical Data of Strasbourg (CDS). We present our photometric results: the name of the

object and for each image we specify the Julian Date (JD, not corrected for light time), the

relative magnitude (mag in magnitudes) and the 1-σ error associated (Err. in magnitude),

the ﬁlter (Fil.) used during observational runs, the phase angle (α, in degree), topocentric

(rh) and heliocentric (∆) distances (both distances in Astronomical Units, AU). ”Cle” stands

for Clear ﬁlter.

Table 4: Summary of results from this work. In this table, we present the preferred rotational

period (Rot. per.

in hour), the preferred photometric period (Phot. per.

in hour) and

the peak-to-peak lightcurve amplitude (∆m in magnitude), the Julian Date (ϕ0) for which

the phase is zero in our lightcurves. The Julian Date is without light time correction.

The preferred photometric period is the periodicity obtained thanks to the data reduction.

Preferred rotational period is estimated based on our criteria to distinguish if a lightcurve is

shape- or albedo-dominated and based on the asymmetry of the lightcurve (see Section 3.3

for more details). We also report if the lightcurve is asymmetric or not (Asym. LC column)

and if the object is known to be a binary one (i.e. binary companion detected or not with

the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), last column). Some objects have not been observed with

HST to detect binarity and are indicated with a question mark.

Table 5: ”STDEV” stands for Standard Deviation, ”SE” for Standard Error and are as-

sociated to the average and median rotational periods. The last column report the mean

rotational period obtained from the Maxwellian ﬁts. All values are in hours. We consider

several sub-samples to consider the conﬁrmed family members, the candidates as well as the

other TNOs. We also removed the binary population (labeled as binary pop) from the last

sample because it has been shown that such a population is aﬀected by tidal eﬀects between

the components of the system and therefore, their rotational period is not primordial (for

more details see Thirouin et al. (2014)).

Table 6: Elongation and lower limit to the density for all objects studied are summarized in
this table. We consider two cases: i) equatorial view (viewing angle of 90◦), and ii) viewing
angle of 60◦. Lower limit to the density has been computed using Chandrasekhar (1987). As

mentioned in the discussion, this model assumes that objects are in hydrostatic equilibrium

and are triaxial (Jacobi) objects. Lower limits for MacLaurin spheroids are also reported

here but, one has to keep in mind that these densities are based on assumptions that do not

hold for this kind of objects.

orbital/physical variables. We looked into thirteen samples of data. family stands for all

conﬁrmed members of the family, candidates are reported in Table 3, Other TNOs refers to

all TNOs without relation with the family, and no binary pop excludes the binary

population. We indicate the Spearman rank correlation (ρ), the Signiﬁcance Level (SL in

percent), and the number of objects in each sample (Nb). Only positive

correlations/anti-correlations with a Spearman rank and Signiﬁcance Level in agreement

with our criterion are reported.

Fig. 26.— Density versus absolute magnitude: two samples are plotted: conﬁrmed Haumea

family members (black circles), and candidates (open circles). Most of the densities are only

lower limit densities derived from lightcurves assuming an equatorial view (see Discussion).

In the case of 2003 SQ317, density assuming a contact binary and reported in Lacerda et al.

(2014) has been used. It seems that the smallest members have the lowest density, except

in the case of the contact binary which seems to have the highest density. Lower limits to

density are reported in Table 6 for objects studied in this work. In the case of Makemake

and Salacia, we used densities from Ortiz et al. (2012) and Stansberry et al. (2012). For

candidates not studied in this work but with a rotational period estimate, we derive their

densities as in Section 5.3. Absolute magnitudes are from the Minor Planet Center (MPC).
