BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE

HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM

OSCAR AGUDELO AND ANGELA PISTOIA

Abstract. We study the existence of steady states to the Keller-Segel system with
linear chemotactical sensitivity function on a smooth bounded domain in RN , N ≥ 3,
having rotational symmetry. We ﬁnd three diﬀerent types of chemoattractant concen-
tration which concentrate along suitable (N − 2)−dimensional minimal submanifolds
of the boundary. The corresponding density of the cellular slime molds exhibit in the
limit one or more Dirac measures supported on those boundary submanifolds.

In 1970 Keller and Segel [23] presented a system of two strongly coupled parabolic
PDE’s to describe the aggregation of cellular slime molds like Dictyostelium Discoidem.
Assuming the whole process to take place on a suitable bounded region D in RN , N ≥ 1,
with no ﬂux across the boundary, the myxoamoebae density of the cellular slime molds
w(t, x) and the chemoattractant concentration v(t, x) at time t in a point x in D satisfy
the system

∂tw = ∇ [µ(w, v)∇w − χ(w, v)∇v] in R × D
∂tv = γ0∆v + k(w, v) in R × D
∂νw = ∂νv = 0 in R × ∂D
w(0, x) = w0(x), v(0, x) = v0(x) in D,

• χ(w, v) = χ0µ(w, v)w∇Φ(v) is the total chemotaxic ﬂux, where χ0 is a constant

and Φ is a smooth increasing function called chemotactic sensitivity function

• γ0 > 0 is a constant diﬀusion coeﬃcient
• k(w, v) models the reaction, which commonly is k(w, v) = γ0(αw − βv) for some

constants α and β.

• ν is the unit inner normal derivative at the boundary.

This model has attracted the attention of many mathematicians, since it has led to
a variety of stimulating problems. Many contributions have been made towards under-
standing analytical aspects of system (1.1). We refer the reader to [3,4,6,8,13,15,18–22]
and references therein. In particular, we quote the recent survey [2] which focuses on the
original model and some of its developments and is devoted to the qualitative analysis of
analytic problems, such as the existence of solutions, blow-up and asymptotic behavior.

The understanding of the global dynamics of the system is strongly related to the

existence of steady states, namely solutions to the system

∇ [µ(w, v)∇w − χ(w, v)∇v] = 0 in D
γ0∆v + k(w, v) = 0 in D
∂νw = ∂νv = 0 in ∂D.

(1.2)




The present paper deals with the existence of stationary solutions to the problem
(1.1) when the chemotactical sensitivity function Φ is linear, i.e. Φ(v) = v,. In such a
case the study of (1.2) reduces to a single equation. Indeed, the function w(x) = λeχ0v
solves the ﬁrst equation and the second equation reduces to

∆v + αλeχ0v − βv = 0 in D,

∂νv = 0 on ∂D.

(1.3)

Here we study problem (1.3), which without loss of generality can be rewritten as

∆v + ε2ev − v = 0 in D,

∂νv = 0 on ∂D.

(1.4)

when D is a bounded domain in RN , N ≥ 1, ν is the inner unit normal vector to ∂Ω
and ε is a small parameter.

The one dimensional version of equation (1.4), was ﬁrst treated by Schaaf in [27].
In the two-dimensional case, Wang and Wei [30] and Senba and Suzuki [28] proved
the existence of a non-costant solution for ε ≤ ε0 for some ε0 and ε possibly diﬀerent
from certain values depending on the domain. Successively, del Pino and Wei in [11]
constructed solutions to (1.4) which concentrate (as ε goes to zero) at κ diﬀerent points
ξ1, . . . , ξκ on the boundary of D and ℓ diﬀerent points ξκ+1, . . . , ξκ+ℓ inside the domain
D. In particular far away from those points the leading behavior of vε is given by

Here δζ represents the Dirac’s mass concentrated at the point ζ. The corresponding

Recently, Del Pino, Pistoia and Vaira in [10] built a solution to problem (1.4) which
concentrate along the whole boundary. In particular, far away from the boundary the
leading behavior of vε is given by

| ln ε|

vε(x) → G(x)

where G is the unique solution of the problem

(1.7)
The corresponding solution uε = ε2evε of the ﬁrst equation in (1.2) exhibits in the

limit a Dirac measures supported on the boundary with a suitable weight, namely

1

| ln ε|

uε ⇀ −∂νG δ∂D.

(∂νG < 0, because of the maximum principle and Hopf’s Lemma) .

As far as we know the only results dealing with higher-dimensional cases concerns the
case when D is a ball. Biler in [3] established the existence of a strictly decreasing radial
solutions, while Pistoia and Vaira in [26] found a second radial solution which is in-
creasing and concentrates along the whole boundary of the domain as ε approaches zero.

Clearly, a natural question arises.

Do there exist solutions to problem (1.4) in higher dimensional domains? In particular,
is it possible to ﬁnd solutions to problem (1.4) which concentrates on suitable submani-
folds of the boundary as the parameter ε approaches zero?

In the present paper we give a positive answer when the domain has a rotational
symmetry. Let n = 1, 2, be ﬁxed. Let Ω be a smooth open bounded domain in R2 such
that

Ω ⊂ {(x1, x2, x′) ∈ Rn × R2−n : xi > 0, i = 1, n}.

Let M =

n

Pi=1

Mi, Mi ≥ 2, and set

D := {(y1, yn, x′) ∈ RM1 × RMn × R2−n : (|y1| , |yn| , x′) ∈ Ω}.

(1.8)

Then D is a smooth bounded domain in RN , N := M + 2 − n.

The solutions we are looking for are Γ−invariant for the action of the group Γ :=

O(M1) × O(Mn) on RN given by

(g1, gn)(y1, yn, x′) := (g1y1, gnyn, x′).

Here O(Mi) denotes the group of linear isometries of RMi.
A simple calculation shows that a function v of the form
v(y1, yn, x′) = u (|y1| , |yn| , x′)

solves problem (1.4) if and only if u solves the problem

where Ω ⊂ R2 is a smooth bounded domain, a : Ω → R is a strictly positive smooth
function and ε > 0 is a small parameter. Here ν stands for the inner unit normal vector
to ∂Ω.

Our goal is to construct solutions to problem (1.11) which concentrate at points
ζ1, . . . , ζm of the boundary of Ω as ǫ goes to 0. They correspond via (1.9) to Γ−invariant
solutions to problem (1.4) with layers which concentrate along the Γ−orbit Ξ(ζi) of ζi,
for i = 1, . . . , m as ǫ approaches zero. Here

Ξ(ζi) := {(y1, yn, x′) ∈ ∂D : (|y1| , |yn| , x′) = ζi ∈ ∂Ω}

(1.12)

is a (N − 2)−dimensional minimal submanifold of the boundary of D diﬀeomorphic to
SM1−1 × SMn−1 where SMi−1 is the unit sphere in RMi.

In order to state our main result, we need to introduce some tools.

The basic cell in our construction are the so-called standard bubbles

Uµ,ζ(x) := ln(cid:18)

8µ2

(µ2 + |x − ζ|2)2(cid:19) , x, ζ ∈ R2, µ > 0,

which solve the Liouville equation

∆U + eU = 0 in R2.

(1.13)

(1.14)

To get a good approximation, we need to project the bubbles in order to ﬁt the Neumann
boundary condition with the linear diﬀerential operator

Lau := ∆u + ∇(ln a) · ∇u − u,

(1.15)

namely

LaP Uµ,ζ = LaUµ,ζ in Ω, ∂νP Uµ,ζ = 0 on ∂Ω.

To compute the error given by the projected bubble, we need to perform a careful
analysis of the regularity and asymptotic behavior of the Green’s function Ga(·, ζ)
associate with La with Neumann boundary condition, namely
in Ω,

(1.16)

(1.17)

for every ζ ∈ Ω. The regular part of Ga(·, ζ) is deﬁned for x ∈ Ω as

All the previous arguments yield immediately the following existence result for the

higher-dimensional problem (1.4).

Theorem 4. Assume D is as described in (1.8).

(i) If (A1) of Theorem (1) holds, then for every ε > 0 small enough, there exists a
Γ−invariant solution vε to problem (1.4) with m interior layers which concen-
trate at m distinct (N − 2)−dimensional minimal submanifold of the boundary
of D as ε → 0. Moreover (see (1.12))

trate at m distinct (N − 2)−dimensional minimal submanifold of the boundary
of D as ε → 0. Moreover (see (1.12))

ε2ZD

evε(x)dx → 4π

(iii) If (A3) of Theorem (3), then for any integer m ≥ 1 and every ε > 0 small
enough, there exists a Γ−invariant solution vε to problem (1.4) with m boundary
layers which concentrate at the same (N −2)−dimensional minimal submanifold
of the boundary of D as ε → 0. Moreover (see (1.12))

ε2ZD

evε(x)dx → 4πm|Ξ(ζ0)| as ε → 0.

Let us make some comments.

First, we strongly believe that our results hold true even if we drop the symmetry
assumption. In particular, we conjecture that (i) and (ii) of Theorem 4 can be rephrased
in the more general form

(1) if D is a general bounded domain in RN with N ≥ 3 and Ξ is a (N−2)−dimensio-
nal minimal submanifold (possibly non-degenerate) of the boundary of D with a
suitable sign on the sectional curvatures, then problem (1.4) has a solution with
an interior layer concentrating along Ξ as ε goes to zero.

(2) if D is a general bounded domain in RN with N ≥ 3 and Ξ is a (N−2)−dimensio-
nal minimal submanifold (possibly non-degenerate) of the boundary of D, then
problem (1.4) has a solution with a boundary layer concentrating along Ξ as ε
goes to zero.

8

O. AGUDELO AND A. PISTOIA

Second, the proof of our result relies on a well known Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure.
The same strategy has been used by Wei, Ye and Zhou [32, 33] to ﬁnd concentrating
solutions for the anisotropic Dirichlet problem

−div(a(x)∇u) = ε2a(x)eu

in Ω,

u = 0

on ∂Ω,

where Ω ⊂ R2 is a smooth bounded domain, a : Ω → R is a strictly positive smooth
function and ε > 0 is a small parameter.

The structure of the paper is the following. In section 2 we perform a careful study of
Green’s function introduced in (1.16). In section 3 we provide the approximation of the
solutions predicted by our existence Theorems and compute the error created by this
approximation. Section 4 concerns with the ﬁnite dimensional reduction scheme which
is the ﬁrst step in the proof of our existence results. In section 5 we ﬁnd precise energy
estimates for the approximation found in section 3. Finally, in section 6 we provide the
detailed proof of our existence Theorems using variational and topological arguments.

2. Anisotropic Green’s function

In this part we analyze the asymptotic boundary behavior of the functions G(·, ζ) =

Ga(·, ζ) and H(·, ζ) = Ha(·, ζ) introduced in (1.16) and (1.17), respectively.

We begin by recalling some well known facts about Sobolev spaces and refer the
reader to [5, 12, 16] and references therein, for an exhaustive description of these spaces
and the related results hereby presented.

Let Ω ⊂ R2 be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. The space Lp(Ω) is the

space of measurable functions v : Ω → R for which the norm

kvkLp(Ω) :=


(cid:0)RΩ |v(x)|p dx(cid:1) 1

supx∈Ω |v(x)|,

p , 1 ≤ p < ∞

p = ∞

is ﬁnite. The Sobolev space W k,p(Ω) is the space of functions in Lp(Ω) having weak
derivatives, up to order k, also in Lp(Ω). The space W k,p(Ω) is a Banach space endowed
with the norm

kvkW k,p(Ω) :=

kDivkLp(Ω).

k

Xi=0

Given k ∈ N , we let C k(Ω) denote the space of functions having continuous derivatives
of order k up to the boundary. In addition, for any α ∈ (0, 1], we denote C k,α(Ω) the
H¨older space, consisting of functions v ∈ C k(Ω) for which the H¨older norm

kvkC k,α(Ω) :=

k

Xi=0

kDivkL∞(Ω) + sup

(2.1)

From the continuity of the trace operator together with Sobolev embeddings in one

dimensional manifolds, we ﬁnd that for any 1 < p < 2,

∀q ∈(cid:18)1,

and notice that γ ∈ C ∞(Ω), since a ∈ C ∞(Ω) and a > 0.

γ(x) = (∇ ln a) (x),

Recall also from (1.15) that

L := ∆ + γ(x) · ∇ − 1

and that G = G(x, ζ), the Green’s function associated to L satisﬁes for every ζ ∈ Ω the
boundary value problem

L G(·, ζ) + 8πδζ = 0

∆zR − R =

in R2,

R ∈ L∞

loc(R2).

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

We remark that standard regularity theory implies that R ∈ W 2,p

loc (R2)∩C ∞(R2−{0}),
for any p ∈ (1, 2). On the other hand, Sobolev embeddings allow us to conclude that
for any ball Br(0) of radius r > 0 and centered at the origin

R ∈ W 1,p(Br(0)) ∩ C 0, 1

p (Br(0)),

∀ p ∈ (1, ∞).

(2.7)

Our ﬁrst result uses the function R(z) to describe the regularity of the family of

functions ζ ∈ Ω 7→ H(·, ζ) and concerns with the local behavior of H(x, ζ).

Theorem 5. Let R = R(z) be the function described in (2.6). There exists a function
H1 = H1(x, ζ), such that

10

and

4γ(ζ) · R(x − ζ),

8γ(ζ) · R(x − ζ), ζ ∈ ∂Ω

(2.8)

(ii) the mapping ζ ∈ Ω 7→ H1(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(cid:0)Ω; C 1(Ω)(cid:1) ∩ C 1(∂Ω; C 1(Ω)).

In particular, for any α ∈ (0, 1), H ∈ C 0,α(Ω × Ω) ∩ C 0,α(Ω × ∂Ω) and the Robin’s

function ζ ∈ Ω 7→ H(ζ, ζ) belongs to C 1(Ω) ∩ C 1(∂Ω).

Proof. For ζ ∈ Ω, let us write

c :=(cid:26) 4,

8,

if ζ ∈ Ω
if ζ ∈ ∂Ω.

(2.9)

From (2.3) and (2.5), we observe that

L H(x, ζ) = cγ(x) ·

x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 − c ln(|x − ζ|),

∀ x ∈ Ω

(2.10)

with the boundary condition

∂H(x, ζ)

∀ x ∈ ∂Ω,

x 6= ζ.

(2.11)

The right hand side in (2.10) can be written as

cγ(ζ) ·

x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 + E(x, ζ),

(2.12)

where

E(x, ζ) := c (γ(x) − γ(ζ)) ·

x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 − c ln(|x − ζ|).

Using a smooth extension of the function γ to a larger compact domain containing

Ω, we ﬁnd a constant C > 0 depending only on γ and Ω such that

On the other hand, given p ∈ (0, 1), there exists a constant C = C(p, Ω) > 0, such

that for every ζ ∈ Ω,

We conclude that for any p ∈ (1, ∞), the mapping

to C(Ω; Lp(Ω)) ∩ C(∂Ω; Lp(Ω)).

ζ ∈ Ω 7→ E(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(Ω; Lp(Ω)) ∩ C 1(∂Ω; Lp(Ω)).

Deﬁne

H1(x, ζ) := H(x, ζ) − c γ(ζ) · R(x − ζ),

∀x, ζ ∈ Ω,

where R = R(z) is the vector function described in (2.6) and c is described in (2.9).

From (2.6), (2.10) and (2.12), we compute the equation for H1(·, ζ) to obtain that

L H1(x, ζ) = −c γ(x) · (γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ)) + E(x, ζ),

in Ω

(2.13)

and the boundary condition reads as

∂H1(x, ζ)

∂νx

= c ν(x) ·(cid:18) x − ζ

|x − ζ|2 − γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ)(cid:19)

on ∂Ω.

(2.14)

The fact that ζ 7→ E(·, ζ) belongs to C(Ω; Lp(Ω)) ∩ C(∂Ω; Lp(Ω)) for any p ∈ (1, ∞),
together with (2.7), imply that for any p ∈ (1, ∞) and any ζ ∈ Ω, the right hand side
in equation (2.13) belongs to Lp(Ω).

In the case ζ ∈ Ω, the right hand side in (2.14) is smooth. In the case ζ ∈ ∂Ω, we
appeal to Lemma 7.1 in the Appendix and embedding (2.2) to ﬁnd that for any ζ ∈ ∂Ω
the right hand side in (2.14) belongs to Lp(∂Ω) for any p > 1.

Standard elliptic regularity theory implies that for any p ∈ (1, ∞), H1(·, ζ) ∈ W 2,p(Ω)
and the Sobolev embeddings in (2.1) yield that H1(·, ζ) ∈ C 1,α(Ω), for any α ∈ (0, 1).
Finally, we check that ζ 7→ H1(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(Ω; C 1(Ω)) ∩ C 1(∂Ω; C 1(Ω)). We
loc (R2) and

ﬁrst deal with the inner regularity. Recall that for any p ∈ (1, 2), R ∈ W 2,p
ζ 7→ ∇ζE belongs C(Ω; Lp(Ω)).

A direct application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem yields that the mapping

ζ ∈ Ω 7→ ∇ζ [ −c γ(x) · (γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ)) + E(x, ζ) ]

belongs to C(Ω; Lp(Ω)) and consequently, the mapping ζ ∈ Ω 7→ ∇ζH1(·, ζ) ∈ W 2,p(Ω)
is well deﬁned and solves

L (∇ζH1(x, ζ)) = ∇ζ [ −c γ(x) · (γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ)) + E(x, ζ) ] ,

in Ω

12

O. AGUDELO AND A. PISTOIA

Regularity theory and Sobolev embeddings in (2.1) and (2.2) imply that the mapping

ζ ∈ Ω 7→ ∇ζH1(·, ζ) belongs to C(Ω; C 0,α(Ω)) for any α ∈ (0, 1).

As for the boundary regularity, we proceed in the same way as we did for the in-
ner regularity, replacing ∇ζ by its the tangential component respect to the ∂Ω. This
concludes the proof of the lemma.
(cid:3)

Next, we introduce some notation that will be needed for subsequent developments.
Fix η > 0 small such that every ζ ∈ Ω with dist(ζ, ∂Ω) < η, has a well deﬁned reﬂection
across ∂Ω along the normal direction, ζ ∗ ∈ Ωc. Denote,

Ωη := {ζ ∈ Ω : dist(ζ, Ω) < η}

which is also a smooth domain. Observe that for any ζ ∈ Ωη, |ζ − ζ ∗| = 2dist(ζ, ∂Ω).

Our next result concerns the boundary asymptotic behavior of the Robin’s function,

which we recall is given by ζ ∈ Ω 7→ H(ζ, ζ).

Proposition 2.1. There exists a mapping z ∈ C(Ωη; C 0,α(Ω)) ∩ L∞(Ωη; C 0,α(Ω)) such
that

H(x, ζ) := −4 ln (|x − ζ ∗|) + z(x, ζ),

∀ x, ∈ Ω,

∀ ζ ∈ Ωη.

Even more, for every ζ ∈ Ωη and x ∈ Ω

z(x, ζ) = 4γ(ζ) · R(x − ζ) − 4γ(ζ ∗) · R(x − ζ ∗) + ˜z(x, ζ),

(2.15)

where the mapping ζ ∈ Ωη 7→ ˜z(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(cid:0)Ωη;C 1(Ω)(cid:1) .

Proof. Consider the function

z(x, ζ) := H(x, ζ) + 4 ln (|x − ζ ∗|) ,

∀ x, ∈ Ω,

∀ ζ ∈ Ωη,

x 6= ζ.

We directly compute from (2.10) and (2.12), to ﬁnd that

L z(·, ζ) = 4γ(x) ·(cid:20) x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 −

x − ζ ∗

|x − ζ ∗|2(cid:21) − 4 [ln(|x − ζ|) − ln(|x − ζ ∗|)] ,

∀ x ∈ Ω.

(2.16)

with the boundary condition

∀ x ∈ ∂Ω.

(2.17)

∂z(x, ζ)

∂νx

= 4ν(x) ·(cid:20) x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 −

x − ζ ∗

|x − ζ ∗|2(cid:21)

The right hand side in equation (2.16) can be written as

4γ(ζ) ·

x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 − 4γ(ζ ∗) ·

x − ζ ∗
|x − ζ ∗|2 + ˜E(x, ζ),

where

˜E(x, ζ) := 4 (γ(x) − γ(ζ)) ·

x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 − 4 (γ(x) − γ(ζ ∗)) ·
− 4 [ln(|x − ζ|) − ln(|x − ζ ∗|)] ,

x − ζ ∗
|x − ζ ∗|2

∀ ζ ∈ Ωη,

x ∈ Ω.

(2.18)

Proceeding in the same fashion as in the proof of Theorem 5, we obtain that the

mapping ζ ∈ Ωη 7→ ˜E(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(Ωη; Lp(Ω)) for any p ∈ (1, ∞).

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 13

To justify (2.15), we use the function R = R(z), from (2.6). We decompose z(x, ζ)

as

z(x, ζ) = 4γ(ζ) · R(x − ζ) − 4γ(ζ ∗) · R(x − ζ ∗) + ˜z(x, ζ)

to ﬁnd that if x ∈ Ω

L ˜z(x, ζ) = −4 γ(x) · (γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ) − γ(ζ ∗) · DzR(x − ζ ∗)) + ˜E(x, ζ).

(2.19)

with the boundary condition if x ∈ ∂Ω

∂ ˜z(x, ζ)

∂νx

= 4ν(x)·(cid:20) x − ζ
|x − ζ|2 −

x − ζ ∗

|x − ζ ∗|2 − (γ(ζ) · DzR(x − ζ) − γ(ζ ∗) · DzR(x − ζ ∗))(cid:21) .

(2.20)
From (2.19) and (2.20), proceeding again as in the proof of Theorem 5, we obtain
that the mapping ζ ∈ Ωη 7→ ˜z(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(Ωη; C 1(Ω)). This concludes the proof
of the proposition.
(cid:3)

Remark: For further develoments we notice that from Proposition 2.1 the function

H = H(x, ζ) has continuous partial derivatives in the set Ω × Ω \ {(x, ζ) : x 6= ζ}.

Also, directly from Proposition 2.1 we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 2.1. Under the assumptions in Proposition 2.1, the Robin’s function,

satisﬁes that

ζ ∈ Ω 7→ H(ζ, ζ)

H(ζ, ζ) := −4 ln (dist(ζ, ∂Ω)) + z(ζ),

∀ ζ ∈ Ωη,

(2.21)

where z ∈ C 1(Ωη) and

z(ζ) := 4γ(ζ) · R(0) − γ(ζ ∗) · R(ζ − ζ ∗) + ˜z(ζ, ζ),

∀ ζ ∈ Ωη.

3. The approximation of the solution

In this part we ﬁnd an appropriate aproximation for a solution of equation (1.11)
which will allow us to carry out a reduction procedure. We also compute the error
created by the choice of our approximation.

To set up our approximation, we ﬁrst identify the formal limit problem associated to

equation (1.11).

Dividing by a(x), equation (1.11) becomes

∆u + γ(x) · ∇u − u + ε2 eu = 0 in Ω,

∂u
∂ν

= 0 on ∂Ω.

(3.1)

Take ε > 0 and set Ωε := ε−1Ω. If u is a solution of (1.11), the function

v(y) = 4 ln(ε) + u(εy),

y ∈ Ωε

(3.2)

solves the equation

∆v + εγ(εy) · ∇v − ε2(v − 4 ln(ε)) + ev = 0 in Ωε,

∂v
∂νε

= 0

on ∂Ωε

(3.3)

14

O. AGUDELO AND A. PISTOIA

where νε is the inner unit normal vector to ∂Ωε.

From (3.1), formally as ε → 0+, we obtain the limit equation

∆V + eV = 0,

in R2,

∇V ∈ L2(R2).

Solutions to (3.4) are given by

V (y) := ln(cid:18)

8 d2

(d2 + |y − ζ ′|2)2(cid:19) ,

for y ∈ R2

where d ∈ R and ζ ′ ∈ R2 are arbitrary parameters.

Pulling back the rescaling in (3.2), for any d > 0 and any ζ ∈ R2, the function

Ud,ζ(x) := ln(cid:18)

8 d2

(ε2d2 + |x − ζ|2)2(cid:19) ,

for x ∈ R2

solves the equation

∆Ud,ζ + ε2eUd,ζ = 0,

in R2,

∇xUd,ζ ∈ L2(R2).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

Let m ∈ N be ﬁxed. Consider m real numbers di > 0 and m arbitrary diﬀerent points

ζi ∈ Ω. For every i = 1, . . . , m, deﬁne

Ui(x) := Udi,ζi(x) = ln 

Let P Ui ∈ H 1(Ω) be the solution of

(3.8)

∆P Ui + γ(x) · ∇P Ui − P Ui + ε2eUi = 0

in Ω,

∂P Ui

∂ν

= 0 on ∂Ω.

(3.9)

By standard regularity theory, P Ui ∈ C ∞(Ω), so that P Ui is indeed a classical

solution of (3.9).

Observe that each function P Ui depends on ε > 0, di and ζi, but for notational

simplicity, we unify this depedence using the subindex i.

For every i = 1, . . . , m, consider the function Hi ∈ C ∞(Ω) given by

Hi(x) := P Ui(x) − Ui(x),

for x ∈ Ω.

From (3.9), Hi solves the equation

∆Hi + γ(x) · ∇Hi − Hi = Ui − γ(x) · ∇Ui

in Ω

(3.10)

with the boundary condition

∂Hi
∂ν

= −

∂Ui

on ∂Ω.

(3.11)

The following assumptions on the parameters di and ζi will play a crucial role in

what follows.

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 15

We assume that for every i = 1, . . . , m, the parameters di > 0 and ζi ∈ Ω depend on

ε > 0. This dependence is expressed by the conditions:

lim
ε→0+

ε dα

i = 0,

∀ α > 0

and in the case that ζi ∈ Ω, for some c0 > 0 and for some κ ≥ 1

dist(ζi, ∂Ω) ≥ c0| ln(ε)|−κ.

(3.12)

(3.13)

Next, lemma concerns the asymptotic behavior of the functions Hi in terms of di,
ζi and ε > 0 small enough. For every ﬁxed i = 1, . . . , m and ζi ∈ Ω, we will use the
convention that

ci :=(cid:26) 1,

ζi ∈ Ω
1
2 , ζi ∈ ∂Ω.

Lemma 3.1. Assume conditions (3.12) and (3.13). Then, for every i = 1, . . . , m and
every ε > 0 small enough, there exists a function zi such that

(i) for every x ∈ Ω

Hi(x) = − ln(8d2

i ) + ci H(x, ζi) + zi(x),

(3.14)

where H = Ha is deﬁned in (1.17) and

(ii) ∀ p ∈ (1, 2), zi ∈ W 2,p(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) and

kzikW 2,p(Ω) + kzikL∞(Ω) ≤ Cε

i ,

where the constant C > 0 depedens only on p.

Proof. For notational simplicity, throughout this proof, we omit the subindex i. Let
ε > 0 be small, d > 0 and ζ ∈ Ω.

For x ∈ Ω, we have that H(x) := P U(x) − U(x). We set for x ∈ Ω

d1, . . . , dm and the points ζ1, . . . , ζm ∈ Ω. Consider the real number

cε := min{|ζi − ζj| : i, j = 1, . . . , m,

assume in addition that

(3.24)

Condition (3.24) means that as ε → 0+, the numbers di might go to inﬁnity, but at

a rate that is controlled by the distance between the points ζi.

Let us denote

4. The reduction scheme

In this part we use the approximation (3.21) described in section 3 to solve equation

(1.11) using a ﬁnite dimensional reduction reduction procedure.

We use the convention that m = k + l for some k, l ∈ {0, . . . , m} and that

ζ1, . . . , ζk ∈ Ω and ζk+1, . . . , ζk+l ∈ ∂Ω.

It will be more convenient to work with the rescaling (3.2). Using the function

described in (3.22), we look for a solution Vε of equation (3.3) having the form

Vε(y) := vε(y) + φ(y),

y ∈ Ωε

so that φ must solve the nonlinear boundary value problem

∆φ − ε2φ = −S(vε) − evεφ − εγ(εy) · ∇φ − N(φ)

in Ωε

with the boundary condition

where we have denoted

∂φ
∂ν

= 0 on ∂Ωε,

N(φ) := evε(cid:2)eφ − 1 − φ(cid:3) .

(4.1)

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 21

cut-oﬀ function so that

Zij(y) := χi(y) zij(y − ζ ′

i),

j = 1, 2.

As for i = k + 1, . . . , k + l, we have that ζi ∈ ∂Ω. For notational simplicity, assume for
the moment that ζi = 0 and that the inner unit normal vector to ∂Ω at ζi is the vector
e2 = (0, 1). Hence, there exists r1 > 0, δ > 0 small and a function p : (−δ, δ) → R
satisfying

p ∈ C ∞(−δ, δ),

p(0) = 0,

p′(0) = 0

and such that

Ω ∩ Br1(ζ) = {(x1, x2) : −δ < x1 < δ,

p(x1) < x2} ∩ Br1(0, 0).

Fi := (Fi1, Fi2),

where Fi1 := x1 +

x2 − p(x1)
1 + |p′(x1)|2 p′(x1)

Fi2 := x2 − G(x1).

At this point we remark that the radius r1 must satisfy that r1 ∈ (0, cε), where cε is

deﬁned in (3.23).

Throughout our discussions we will assume that r1 ∈ ( 1

2cε, cε), so that r1

ε → ∞ as

ε → 0.

The following proposition accounts for the solvability of the linear problem (4.3)-(4.4).

For this we deﬁne the following norm

(4.5)

khk∗ := sup

Proposition 4.1. Assume the conditions of Lemma 3.2 on the parameters di and ζi.
For any ε > 0 small enough and any given h ∈ L∞(Ωε) there exists φ ∈ C 1(Ωε) and
constants cij ∈ R where φ is the unique solution of (4.3). Moreover, there exists a
constant C > 0 independent of ε > 0 such that

k∇φkL∞(Ωε) + kφkL∞(Ωε) ≤ C ln(cid:18) 1

ε(cid:19) khk∗.

With our choice of the radius r1, the proof of Proposition 4.1 follows the same lines
of the proof of Proposition 3.1 in [11] with only slight changes. We leave details to the
reader.

Denote by ζ := (ζ1, . . . , ζm) and T (h) = φ the linear operator given by Proposition

4.1. Clearly T (h) depends on ζ, so we write

Proceeding exactly as in section 3 in [9], we obtain that the mapping ζ → T (h)(ζ)

is diﬀerentiable in ζ and

T (h) = T (h)(ζ).

As a direct application of Proposition 4.1 and a ﬁxed point argument, we solve the

with the boundary and orthogonality conditions in (4.4).

Proposition 4.2. Under assumptions in Propososition 4.1, given any α > 0 for every
ε > 0 small there exists a solution φ and constants cij ∈ RN satisfying (4.6)-(4.4) and
such that

k∇φkL∞(Ωε) + kφkL∞(Ωε) ≤ C εα ln(cid:18) 1
ε(cid:19) .

Even more, φ = Φ(ζ) is diﬀerentiable respect to ζ and

kDζΦk ≤ Cεα ln(cid:18)1
ε(cid:19)2

.

Proof. We proceed using a ﬁxed point argument, as in the proof of Lemma 4.1 in [11]
using the fact that

k∇φk∗ ≤ Ck∇φkL∞(Ωε).

5. The energy estimate

(cid:3)

Our next step, consists in choosing the points ζi ∈ Ω so that the real numbers,
(actually functions of ζ := (ζ1, . . . , ζm) ) cij, in equation (4.6), are identically zero.
Thus leading to the solution of (4.1)-(4.2).

Notice that the dimension of the approximate kernel of the linear problem (4.3)-(4.4)
is 3k + 2l. We get rid of m = k + l elements of this approximate kernel by choosing
parameters d1, . . . , dm satisfying (3.20). On the other hand, associated to the points
ζi ∈ Ω, we must get rid oﬀ the constants ci1 and ci2, while for points ζi ∈ ∂Ω, we must
get rid of only the constants ci1.

Throughout this part, we take ζ1, . . . , ζm ∈ Ω satisfying conditions (3.13) and (3.24).

In addition, we assume that for some κ ≥ 1
c| ln(ε)|−κ ≤ |ζi − ζj| ≤ C,

Since

∀ i, j = 1, . . . , m,

i 6= j.

(5.1)

cε := min{|ζi − ζj| : i, j = 1, . . . , m,

i 6= j}

we notice that cε ≥ c| ln(ε)|−κ.

Since the approximation in (3.21) depends on the points ζi, we write

where

and the di’s are real numbers satisfying

cjG(ζi, ζj),

∀ i = 1, . . . , m.

O. AGUDELO AND A. PISTOIA

Denote also φ = φ(ζ) and cij(ζ) the unique solution of (4.6)-(4.2) and ﬁnally set
˜φ(ζ) := φ(ζ)( x

ε ).

For any u ∈ H 1(Ω), we consider the energy

J(u) :=

a(x)(cid:0)|∇u|2 + u2(cid:1) dx − ε2ZΩ

a(x)eu

(5.3)

which is well deﬁned due to the Moser-Trudinger inequality.
It is well known that
critical points of J are nothing but solutions of equation (1.11). Let us introduce the
so-called reduced energy

The aim of the next result is to understand the role played by Fε and its asymptotic

behavior as ε → 0.

Proposition 5.1.

(i) If ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζm), with the ζi’s satisfying conditions (3.13),
(3.24) and (5.1), is a critical point of the functional Fε then u = uε(ζ) + ˜φ(ζ)
is a critical point of J, i.e. a solution of equation (1.11).

(ii) There holds true that

Fε(ζ) = F0(ζ) + ˜θε(ζ)

C 1−uniformly in ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζm). Here (given c0 := −4π(2 − ln 8))

(5.6)

Moreover ˜θε is a C 1− function such that |˜θε| + |∇ζ

˜θε| → 0 as ε → 0,

Proof. First of all, we prove (i) and the fact that there exists a C 1 diﬀerentiable function
˜θε such that

and as ε → 0,

Fε(ζ) = J(uε(ζ)) + ˜θε(ζ)

|˜θε| + |∇ζ ˜θε| → 0

uniformly in ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζm). The proof follows the same lines of Lemma 5.1 and
Lemma 5.2 in [11], with no changes. We leave details to the reader. We also refer the
reader to [32, 33] for similar computations.

Then we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the energy J(uε(ζ)). We only consider the

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 25

case when the points belong to Ω, because the proof when the points lie on the bound-
ary ∂Ω relies on similar arguments. Moreover, we only compute the C 0−expansion
because the C 1−estimate can be obtained in a similar way.

First of all, since for every i = 1, . . . , m

div(a(x)∇P Ui) − a(x)P Ui + ε2a(x)eUi = 0

in Ω

we know that for any j, i = 1, . . . , m,

Proof of Theorem 1. Let s := (s1, . . . , sm) ∈ (∂Ω)m and t := (t1, . . . , tm) ∈ (R+)m. Let
us consider the conﬁguration space

Λδ := {(s, t) ∈ (∂Ω)m × (R+)m : |si − sj| ≥ δ, δ < ti < 1/δ},

for some δ > 0 small, independent of ε > 0.

For any point in (s, t) ∈ Λδ, we set

ζi := si + | ln(ε)|−1 ti ν(si),

∀i = 1, . . . , m.

(6.1)

Observe that (3.12), (3.13), (3.20) and (3.24) hold true. By Proposition 5.1 we have
m) ∈ Ω × · · · × Ω of the reduced energy Fε where

By (5.5) and the property of Robin’s function we deduce that Fε reduces to

a(si) ln ti + t∂νa(si)# + Θε(s, t),

where the smooth functions Υε(s) only depends on s while Θε(s, t) depends on both s
and t and they are higher order terms, namely |Υε|, |∇Υε|, |Θε|, |∇Θε| → 0 as ε → 0.
The proof of this claim is postponed to the end.

ti

Under assumption (A1), we know that a has m diﬀerent strict local minima or local
maxima points ζ ∗
i . Therefore, for some ρ > 0 small enough,
the Brouwer degree deg(∇a, B(s∗
i , ρ), 0) is well deﬁned and (see, for example, Corollary
2 in [1])

m ∈ ∂Ω. Set s∗

1 , . . . , ζ ∗

i := ζ ∗

On the other hand, since ∂νa(ζ ∗

deg(Si, B(s∗

i , ρ), 0) = ±1 6= 0 for any i = 1, . . . , m.

(6.5)
i ) < 0, we can choose ρ small enough so that for any

si ∈ B(s∗
Set t∗

i , ρ) there exists a unique ti = ti(si) = − a(si)
i := ti(s∗

i ) and let ρ smaller if necessary, so that the Brouwer degree

∂ν a(si) such that Ti(si, ti) = 0.

deg((Si, Ti), B(s∗

i , ρ) × B(t∗

i , ρ), 0)

is well deﬁned. Since ∂tiTi(si, ti(si)) < 0, by (6.5) (see, for example, Lemma 5.7 in [24])
we immediately get that

deg((Si, Ti), B(s∗

i , ρ) × B(t∗

i , ρ), 0) 6= 0 for any i = 1, . . . , m.

Finally, by (6.6) using the properties of Brouwer degree, we get

Combining (6.7) with (6.3) and (6.4) we deduce that if ε is small enough there exists
(sε, tε) such that ∇Fε(sε, tε) = 0. In particular, sε = (sε
m) as
ε → 0. That concludes the proof.

Let us prove (6.2).
Using a smooth extension of the function a(x) we can perform a Taylor expansion

around every point si to obtain that

a(ζi) = a(si) + | ln(ε)|−1 ti∂νa(si) + O([| ln(ε)|−1ti]2).

(6.8)

On the other hand, from Corollary 2.1 and the regularity in (2.7) of the function R(z)
described in (2.6), we ﬁnd that for any α ∈ (0, 1) and any ζi as in (6.1),

H(ζi, ζi) = 4 ln(cid:18)ln(cid:18)1

(6.9)

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 29

On the other hand, since R ∈ C ∞(R2 − {0}), we can use expression (2.5), Proposition

2.1 and the fact that |si − sj| ≥ c > 0, to obtain the expansion

G(ζi, ζj) = −4 ln (|si − sj|) + ˜z(si, sj)

F0(s, t) =

Hence, from (5.5), putting together expressions (6.8), (6.9) and (6.10), we get

7. Appendix

The following technical lemma is rather standard, but for the sake of completeness,

we include the details of the proof.

Lemma 7.1. For every x, ζ ∈ ∂Ω, deﬁne g(x, ζ) as

g(x, ζ) :=


ν(x)·(x−ζ)

|x−ζ|2

,

1
2k∂Ω(ζ),

x ∈ ∂Ω − {ζ},

x = ζ,

where k∂Ω(y) is the signed curvature of ∂Ω at y. Then for every ζ ∈ ∂Ω, g(·, ζ) ∈
C ∞(∂Ω). Even more, the mapping ζ ∈ ∂Ω 7→ g(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(∂Ω; C 1(∂Ω)).

Proof. Recall that ∂Ω is smooth. Let ζ ∈ ∂Ω be arbitrary. After a translation and
a rotation, if necessary, we may assume that ζ = (0, 0) ∈ R2 and that ν(ζ) = (0, 1).
Hence, there exists R > 0, δ > 0 small and a function p : (−δ, δ) → R satisfying

p ∈ C ∞(−δ, δ),

p(0) = 0,

p′(0) = 0

and such that

Ω ∩ BR(ζ) = {(x1, x2) : −δ < x1 < δ,

p(x1) < x2} ∩ BR(0, 0).

The inner unit normal vector in ∂Ω ∩ BR(ζ) is computed as

ν(x1, p(x1)) =

so that for x1 ∈ (−δ, δ)

g(x1, p(x1), ζ) =

(−p′(x1), 1)

p1 + |p′(x1)|2
p1 + |p′(x1)|2

x1 ∈ (−δ, δ),

·

p(x1) − x1 p′(x1)

1 + p2(x1)

.

(7.1)

Since p is smooth, we use Taylor’s expansion together with the fact that p(0) =

p′(0) = 0 to ﬁnd that

p(x1) = x2

1Z 1
r(x1) :=Z 1

where

(1 − t)p′′(t x1)dt = x2

p′′(t x1)dt = x1 q(x1),

(7.2)

(1 − t)p′′(t x1)dt,

q(x1) :=Z 1

p′′(t x1)dt,

for − δ < x1 < δ.

Putting together (7.1) and (7.2) we obtain

p(x1) − x1 p′(x1)

r(x1) − q(x1)

(7.3)

which is a smooth function in (−δ, δ).

BOUNDARY CONCENTRATION PHENOMENA FOR THE HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL KELLER-SEGEL SYSTEM 31

By succesive diﬀerentiation of the identity in (7.3), we conclude that g(x, ζ) is smooth

and also notice that

lim
x1→0

g((x1, p(x1)), ζ) = −

p′′(0) =

k∂Ω(0, 0).

Finally from the smoothness of the tangent bundle of ∂Ω, T (∂Ω), we obtain that ζ 7→
g(·, ζ) belongs to C 1(∂Ω; C 1(∂Ω)) and this concludes the proof of the lemma. Using (cid:3)
