ABSTRACT
Asteroid families are groups of minor bodies produced by high-velocity collisions. Af-
ter the initial dispersions of the parent bodies fragments, their orbits evolve because
of several gravitational and non-gravitational eﬀects, such as diﬀusion in mean-motion
resonances, Yarkovsky and YORP eﬀects, close encounters of collisions, etc. The subse-
quent dynamical evolution of asteroid family members may cause some of the original
fragments to travel beyond the conventional limits of the asteroid family. Eventually,
the whole family will dynamically disperse and no longer be recognizable.

A natural question that may arise concerns the timescales for dispersion of large
families. In particular, what is the oldest still recognizable family in the main belt? Are
there any families that may date from the late stages of the Late Heavy Bombardment
and that could provide clues on our understanding of the primitive Solar System? In
this work, we investigate the dynamical stability of seven of the allegedly oldest families
in the asteroid main belt. Our results show that none of the seven studied families
has a nominally mean estimated age older than 2.7 Gyr, assuming standard values for
the parameters describing the strength of the Yarkovsky force. Most “paleo-families”
that formed between 2.7 and 3.8 Gyr would be characterized by a very shallow size-
frequency distribution, and could be recognizable only if located in a dynamically less
active region (such as that of the Koronis family). V-type asteroids in the central main
belt could be compatible with a formation from a paleo-Eunomia family.

Key words: Minor planets, asteroids: general – celestial mechanics.

INTRODUCTION

Asteroid families are born out of collisions. They “die” when
the fragments formed in the collisional event disperse so far
because of gravitational or non-gravitational forces that the
family is no longer recognizable as a group. The time needed
to disperse small groups has been the subject of several stud-
ies (from our group, see for instance Carruba et al. 2010a,
2011, and 2015). Less attention has been given to the dis-
persion of larger families. Recent studies (Brasil et al. 2015)
suggested that no family could have likely survived the Late
Heavy Bombardment (LHB hereafter, at least 3.8 Gyr ago),
in the jumping Jupiter scenario, which set an upper limit
on the maximum possible age of any asteroid family. In this
work we focus our attention on the families whose estimated
age, according to Broˇz et al. (2013) could possibly date from
just after the LHB, and whose existence, if conﬁrmed, could
provide precious clues on the early stages of our Solar Sys-
tem.

Broˇz et al. (2013) identiﬁed 12 families whose age esti-
mate might have been compatible with an origin during the
LHB, or just after: the Maria, Eunomia, Koronis, Themis,
Hygiea, Meliboea, Ursula, Fringilla, Alauda, Sylvia, Camilla,
and Hermione families. The Sylvia family and the proposed
long-lost groups around Camilla and Hermione in the Cy-
bele region were recently studied in Carruba et al. (2015),
and will not be treated in detail here. That work found that,
while all asteroids in the Cybele region were most likely lost
during the jumping Jupiter phase of the model of plane-
tary migration of Nesvorn´y et al. (2013), some of the largest
fragments (D > 5 km, with D the body diameter) of a hypo-
thetical post-LHB Sylvia family may have remained in the
Cybele region, but the identiﬁcation of these groups could be
diﬃcult. Due to local dynamics, any Camilla and Hermione
families would disperse in time-scales of the order of 1.5 Gyr.
The Fringilla family is a rather small group (134 members,
according to Nesvorn´y et al. 2015) in the outer main belt.
Since we are already studying the larger Themis, Meliboea,
Alauda and Ursula families in the outer main belt, and since
the group is not large enough for the techniques used in this

work, we will not further investigate this family in this pa-
per. The Hygiea family was studied at length in Carruba
et al. (2014a), that found a maximum possible age of 3.6
Gyr, just a bit younger than the minimum currently believed
epoch of the last stages of the LHB, i.e., 3.8 Gyr (Bottke et
al. 2012; also the age of the Hygiea family should be most
likely younger than 3.6 Gyr, because of the long-term ef-
fect of close encounters with 10 Hygiea and of the stochastic
YORP eﬀect of Bottke et al. 2015, this last eﬀect not con-
sidered in Carruba et al. 2014a). Age estimates for the other
families listed in Broˇz et al. (2013) are however known with
substantial uncertainty, and were obtained before Bottke et
al. (2015) modeled the so-called stochastic YORP eﬀect, in
which the shapes of asteroids changes between YORP cy-
cles, and whose eﬀect is generally to reduce the estimates of
the given asteroid family age. Understanding which, if any,
of the proposed “Broˇz seven” oldest groups (Maria, Euno-
mia, Koronis, Themis, Meliboea, Ursula, Alauda) could have
survived since the LHB, and how, is the main goal of this
work.

This paper is so divided: In Sect. 2 we identiﬁed the
seven “Broˇz” families in a new space of proper elements and
SDSS-MOC4 gri slope and z ′ −i′ colors, and use the method
of Yarkovsky isolines to obtain estimates of maximum pos-
sible ages of these groups. In Sect. 3 we use Monte Carlo
methods (see Carruba et al. 2015) to obtain reﬁned esti-
mates of the family age and ejection velocity parameters of
the same families. Sect. 4 deals with the dynamical evolution
and dispersion times of ﬁctitious simulated “Broˇz” groups
since the latest phases of the Late Heavy Bombardment,
when the stochastic YORP eﬀect (Bottke et al. 2015) and
past changes in the solar luminosity (Carruba et al. 2015)
are accounted for. Finally, in the last section, we present our
conclusions.

2 FAMILY IDENTIFICATION

In order to obtain age estimates of the seven Broˇz fam-
ilies, we ﬁrst need to obtain good memberships of these
groups. Any method used should aim to reduce the num-
ber of possible interlopers, objects that may be part of the
dynamical family, but have taxonomical properties incon-
sistent with that of the majority of the members. DeMeo
and Carry (2013) recently introduced a new classiﬁcation
method, based on the Bus-DeMeo taxonomic system, that
employs Sloan Digital Sky Survey-Moving Object Catalog
data, fourth release (SDSS-MOC4 hereafter, Ivezi´c et al.
2002) gri slope and z’ -i’ colors. In that article the au-
thors used the photometric data obtained in the ﬁve ﬁlters
u′, g ′, r′, i′, and z ′, from 0.3 to 1.0 µm, to obtain values of
z ′ − i′ colors and spectral slopes over the g ′, r′, and i′ re-
ﬂectance values, that were then used to assign to each aster-
oid a likely spectral type. Since the authors were interested
in dealing with a complete sample, they limited their anal-
ysis to asteroids with absolute magnitude H higher than
15.3, which roughly corresponds to asteroids with diameters
larger than 5 km, and for which the SDSS-MOC4 data-set is
supposed to be complete. Since Carruba et al. (2015) showed
that the vast majority of asteroids that could survive 3.8
Gyr of dynamical evolution in the post-LHB scenario should
have diameters larger than 5 km, we believe that this choice

of limit in H could also be suitable for this research. For
completeness, we also included asteroids with H < 12.00
with known spectral types from the Planetary Data System
(Neese 2010) that are not part of SDSS-MOC4. These ob-
jects were assigned values of the gri slope and z ′ − i′ colors
at the center of the range of those of each given class. We
refer the reader to DeMeo and Carry (2013) and Carruba
et al. (2014a) for more details on the procedure to obtain
gri slope and z ′ − i′ colors, and on how to assign asteroids
spectral classes based on these data.

deﬁned as k1 = 5/4, k2 = 2, k3 = 2 in Zappal´a et al. (1990,
1995). ∆gri and ∆(i − z) are diﬀerence between two neigh-
boring asteroids gri slopes and z ′ − i′ colors, CSP V is a
constant equal to 106 (see also Carruba et al. 2013 for a dis-
cussion on the choice of this constant) and fgri = 0.027 is
a normalization factor to account for diﬀerences among the
mean values of diﬀerences in gri slope and z ′ − i′ colors (dif-
ferent values of fgri in the range 0.05-0.001 have been used
without substantially aﬀecting the output of the method).
We assigned families to their regions, deﬁned as in Broˇz et
al. (2013) as the central main belt, the pristine region, the
outer main belt and the outer highly inclined region, and
compute proper elements and gri slope and z ′ − i′ colors for
all asteroids in each given region. We then computed nomi-
nal distance cutoﬀ and stalactite diagrams with the standard
techniques described in Carruba (2010b), for all the seven
Broˇz families, and then assigned values of diameters and ge-
ometric albedos from the WISE catalog (Wright et al. 2010)
to family members for which this information is available
(other objects were assigned the values of geometric albedo
of the largest object in the family, and diameters computed
using equation 1 in Carruba et al. 2003). Finally the method
of the Yarkovsky isolines (see also Carruba et al. 2013) is ap-
plied to obtain an estimate of the maximum possible age of
each given family. In the next subsection we will discuss in
detail the method for families in the outer main belt, results
are similar for other regions.

red and blue lines are the expected displacement of family
members over 3.8 and 4.6 Gyr because of the Yarkovsky ef-
fect and close encounters with massive asteroids, assumed
equal to 0.01 AU for simplicity (Carruba et al. 2014a). All
asteroids were assumed to be initially at the family barycen-
ter. This method yields maximum ages of 4.6 Gyr for the
three Themis, Meliboea, and Ursula families. Information
on number of conﬁrmed members and interlopers is given in

2.1 The outer main belt: the Themis, Meliboea,

and Ursula families

The outer main belt is deﬁned in Nesvorn´y et al. (2015)
as the region between the 7J:-3A and 2J:-1A mean-motion
resonances and sin (i) < 0.3. Three possible old C-complex
families have been proposed in this region: the Themis, Meli-
boea, and Ursula groups. We identiﬁed 5472 asteroids with
either taxonomical or SDSS-MOC4 information in the area,
3524 of which with data in the WISE data-set, and 2896
(82.2%) with pV < 0.15. The value of the minimal distance
cutoﬀ d0 was of 157.5 m/s and the minimal number of ob-
jects to have a group statistically signiﬁcant was 25.

Fig. 1, panel A, displays a stalactite diagram for this
region. The families of Themis, Meliboea, and Ursula were
all visible at the nominal distance cutoﬀ d0, but not for
lower values of d. 137 Meliboea merges with the local back-
ground at d = 300 m/s. The family of 375 Ursula merges
with Eos at cutoﬀ of 250 m/s, and with other minor groups
at d = 225 m/s, so we choose to work with a cutoﬀ of 220
m/s. Other important families in the region were those of
221 Eos and 10 Hygiea. Panel B of Fig. 1 displays a con-
tour plot of number density of asteroids in the (a, sin (i))
plane. Whither tones are associated with higher values of
local number density. For our grid in this domain, we used
30 steps of 0.01 AU in a, starting from a = 3.0 AU, and 34
steps of 0.01 in sin (i), starting from sin (i) = 0.0. The mem-
bers of the identiﬁed Themis, Meliboea and Ursula families,
after taxonomical interlopers were removed (there were none
in these cases), are shown as red, green, and blue circles, re-
spectively.

Finally, we also apply the method of Yarkovsky iso-
lines (Carruba et al. 2013) to the Themis, Meliboea, and
Ursula families, using standard values of the parameters of
this force for C-type groups from Broˇz et al. (2013), Table
2. Results are shown in Fig. 2 for the Themis family. The

3 CHRONOLOGY

Monte Carlo methods to obtain estimates of the family
age and ejection velocity parameters were pioneered by
Vokrouhlick´y et al. (2006a, b, c) for the Eos and other as-
teroid groups. They were recently modiﬁed to account for
the “stochastic” version of the YORP eﬀect (Bottke et al.
2015), and for changes in the past values of Solar luminosity
(Vokrouhlick´y et al. 2006a) for a study of dynamical groups
in the Cybele region (Carruba et al. 2015). Age estimates
obtained including the stochastic YORP eﬀect in Carruba
et al. (2015) were i) of better quality with respect those ob-
tained with the static version of YORP for old families, in
terms of conﬁdence level, and ii) tend to produce younger
age estimates. We refer the reader to Bottke et al. (2015)
and Carruba et al. (2015) for a more in depth description
of the method. Essentially, the semi-major axis distribution
of various ﬁctitious families is evolved under the inﬂuence
of the Yarkovsky, both diurnal and seasonal versions, and
YORP eﬀect (and occasionally other eﬀects such as close
encounters with massive asteroids (Carruba et al. 2014a) or
changes in past solar luminosity values (Carruba et al. 2015).
This method, however, ignores the eﬀect of planetary per-
turbations. The newly obtained distributions of a C-target
function computed with the relationship:

0.2H = log10(∆a/C),

(3)

are then compared to the current C distribution of real fam-
ily members using a χ2-like variable ψ∆C (Vokrouhlick´y et
al. 2006a, b, c), whose minimum value is associated with the
best-ﬁtted solution.

We applied this method to six out of the seven “Broˇz”
families. For the case of the Maria family, since this group
was signiﬁcantly depleted at lower semi-major axis by inter-
action with the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonance, the number
of remaining intervals in the C-target function was too small
to allow for a precise determination of the family age. Fig. 3
displays ψ∆C values in the (Age, VEJ ) plane for Alauda fam-
ily. Values of the VEJ parameter, that describes the spread
in the terminal ejection velocities (Vokrouhlick´y et al. 2006),
tend to be lower than the estimated escape velocity from the
parent body (Bottke et al. 2015), 156.5 m/s for the case of
the Alauda family. To estimate nominal values of the un-
certainties associated with our estimate of the age and the
VEJ parameter, here we used the approach ﬁrst described
in Vokrouhlick´y et al. (2006a,b,c). First, we computed the
number of degrees of freedom of the χ2-like variable, given
by the number of intervals in the C distribution with more
than 10 asteroids (we require a minimum number of 10 as-
teroid per C interval so as to avoid the problems associated

with dividing by small number when computing ψ∆C ), mi-
nus 2, the number of parameters estimated from the distri-
bution. Then, assuming that the ψ∆C probability distribu-
tion is given by a incomplete gamma function of arguments
ψ∆C and the number of degrees of freedom, we computed
the value of ψ∆C associated with a 1-sigma probability (or
68.3%) that the simulated and real distribution were com-
patible (Press et al. 2001).1

For the case of the Alauda family, we had 32 C intervals
with more than 10 asteroids, and 30 degrees of freedom.
The Alauda family should be 640 ± 50 Myr old, with VEJ =
95+15
−20 m/s, and a secondary minimum at lower values of VEJ .
Our results for the six families are summarized in Table 2,
were we display the name of the family, the estimated age,
the values of VEJ , and the limit used for ψ∆C .

1 We should caution the reader that other methods to estimate
the uncertainties for the estimated parameters are also used in the
literature. For instance, one can compute the 1-, 2- or 3-sigma χ2
values and sum these to the minimum observed value of χ2 to
obtain estimates of the errors at 1-, 2-, or 3-sigma levels (Press et
al. 2001). Since age estimates for very old families, such as those
studied in this work, tend to produce shallow minima, here we
prefer to use the Vokrouhlick´y et al. (2006a,b,c) approach, so as
to provide a more limited range of estimated values. But larger
values of the error estimates are possible.

Overall, we found that no family is nominally older than
2.7 Gyr, but uncertainties are too large for the Koronis,
Themis, and Ursula families for a positive conclusion to be
reached. We compared our results with the maximum age
estimates from Broˇz et al. (2013) and from the more recent
work of Spoto et al. (2015), that found estimates for the
family ages with a V-shape method in the (a, 1/D) domain.

Spoto et al. (2015)2.

To within the uncertainties, our estimates tend to be
in agreement with previous results, with the two possible
exceptions of the Alauda and Meliboea families, that could
potentially be younger than previously thought (but uncer-
tainties for these two families may be larger if diﬀerent ap-
proaches for the error on the χ2-like variable were used.)
Masiero et al. (2012) investigated the eﬀect that changes in

2 In Spoto et al. (2015) the authors found estimates for the left
and right semi-major axis distributions of family members with
respect to the family barycenter. Results in Table 3 are for the
maximum possible estimates, among the two, when available (for
the Maria and Ursula there was data for just one of the fam-
ily wings, there was no estimate available for the Meliboea and
Alauda families. The Eunomia parent body may have experienced
two or more impacts, according to these authors. Table 3 reports
the estimated age of the oldest impact).

the nominal values of the parameters aﬀecting the Yarkovsky
and YORP forces may have on the estimate of the age of the
Baptistina family and found that the parameters whose val-
ues most aﬀected the strength of the Yarkovsky force were
the asteroid density and the thermal conductivity. Since the
largest variations were observed for changes in the values
of the family thermal conductivity, for the sake of brevity
in this work we concentrate our analysis on this parameter.
Maximal ages can be found if one consider a value of the
thermal conductivity of K = 0.1 W/m/K. We repeated our
analysis for the six “Broˇz” families, and this larger value of
K, and our results are summarized in Table 4, where we
display the estimated ages, ejection velocity parameter, and
maximum possible age.

The ages of the S-type families Koronis and Eunomia
in these simulations was larger then 4.5 Gyr, but that it is
just an artifact caused by the improbably high value of K
(0.1 W/m/K) used for these simulations (typical values of
K for S-type families are of the order of 0.001 W/m/K).
More interesting were the results for the C-complex groups:
while the maximum possible ages for the Themis and Ursula
families were beyond 3.0 Gyr, none of the groups, even in

this very favorable scenario, has nominal ages old enough to
reach the earliest estimates for the LHB (3.8 Gyr ago). The
implications of this analysis will be further explored in the
next section.

4 DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF OLD

FAMILIES

To study the possible survival of any of the largest
members of the oldest main belt family over ≃ 4 Gyr,
we performed simulations with the SY SY CE integrator
(Swift+Yarkovsky+Stochastic YORP+Close encounters) of
Carruba et al. (2015), modiﬁed to also account for past
changes in the values of the solar luminosity. The numer-
ical set-up of our simulations was similar to what discussed
in Carruba et al. (2015): we used the optimal values of the
Yarkovsky parameters discussed in Broˇz et al. (2013) for
C- and S-type asteroids, the initial spin obliquity was ran-
dom, and normal reorientation timescales due to possible
collisions as described in Broˇz (1999) were considered for all
runs. We integrated our test particles under the inﬂuence of
all planets, and obtained synthetic proper elements with the
approach described in Carruba (2010b).

We generated ﬁctitious families with the ejection pa-
rameter VEJ found in Sect. 3 (for the Maria family we
used the same value found for the Eunomia group, i.e.,
VEJ = 90 m/s), and integrated these groups over 4.0 Gyr.
Also, since only bodies larger than 4 Km in diameter were
shown to survive in the Cybele region over 4.0 Gyr, following
the approach of Carruba et al. (2015) we generated families
with size-frequency distributions (SFD) with an exponent
−α that best-ﬁtted the cumulative distribution equal to 3.6,
a fairly typical value, and with diameters in the range from
2.0 to 12.0 km. The number of simulated objects was equal
to the currently observed number of family members with
diameters between 2.0 and 12.0 km.

For each of the simulated families, we computed the
fraction of objects that remained in a box deﬁned by the
maximum and minimum value of (a, e, sin (i)) associated
with current members of the seven families as a function
of time, the fraction of objects with 4 < D < 6 km, and the
time evolution of the −α exponent. These parameters will
help estimating the dynamical evolution of the simulated
families: the lower the values of these numbers, the more
evolved and diﬀused should be the family. Also, to quantify
the dispersion of the family members as a function of time,
we also computed the nominal distance velocity cutoﬀ d0
for which two nearby asteroids are considered to be related
using the approach of Beaug´e and Roig (2001), that deﬁnes
this quantity as the average minimum distance between all
possible asteroid pairs, as a function of time (typical values
are of the order of 50 m/s, signiﬁcantly larger values would
indicate that the family was dynamically dispersed beyond
recognition).

Our results for the Koronis family are shown in Fig. 4,
where we display in panel A the time evolution of the frac-
tion of all asteroids remaining in the Koronis family region
(blue line) and of the objects with 4 < D < 6 km (green
line). Panel B shows the time evolution of the −α exponent,
while panel C displays d0 as a function of time. The Koro-
nis family is in a dynamically less active region, so a larger

fraction of its original population survive the simulation, but
this is not the case for all investigated families. Our results
at t = 3.8 Gyr, the minimum estimated age for the end of
the late heavy bombardment, are reported in Table 5.

Overall, the Meliboea and Alauda synthetic families
were dispersed beyond recognition. All families had values
of −α at t = 3.8 Gyr much shallower than the initial value
(3.6), and compatible with typical values of background as-
teroids (≃ 2). This does not necessarily mean that all paleo-
families should be characterized by a shallow SFD. The ini-
tial SFD could have been much steeper, and collisionary evo-
lution could have replenished the population of asteroids at
smaller sizes. There are indeed some indications that some
potential paleo-families, such as Itha, could be characterized
by a relatively steep SFD (Broˇz et al. 2012). However, dy-
namical eﬀects alone indeed tend to remove smaller size bod-
ies and to produce families with shallower SFD. In regimes
where dynamical eﬀects are prodominant and the initial
SFD was not too steep, we would expect paleo-families to
be characterized by a shallow SFD. Also, according to the
values of d0 found in this work, only the synthetic Koronis,
Maria, and possibly Eunomia family would be recognizable,
with some diﬃculties, with respect to the background (typ-
ical values of d0 depends on the local density of asteroids,
but are usually of the order of 50-60 m/s). To help visualize
the diﬀerence between a completely dispersed family, such
Alauda, and a relatively well preserved one, such Maria, we
show in Fig. 5 a projection in the (a, sin (i)) of the outcome
of our simulations at t = 3.8 Gyr. While only a handful
of the largest members of Alauda survived up to this time,
the simulated Maria family, while dispersed, could still be
recognizable in this domain.

Can any paleo-family still be observable today? As we
discussed, paleo-families would be diﬃcult to recognize with
traditional methods such as HCM, being characterized by a
shallow SFD, a signiﬁcant depletion in small family mem-
bers (those less than 5 km in diameter), and a large spread
among the surviving members. Paleo-families belonging to
fairly typical taxonomical classes, such as C- and S-type,
would be extremely hard to recognize. It was however pro-
posed that V-type asteroids in the Eunomia orbital region
could have been fragments of a paleo-Eunomia family as-
sociated with the disruption of Eunomia parent body crust
(Carruba et al. 2007, 2014b). We checked the −α value of
the 16 V-type photometric candidates SFD currently in the
Eunomia orbital region (deﬁned according to our box crite-
ria), and we found a value of 1.95. While this result should
be considered with caution, given the limited number of V-
type asteroids in the region and possible limitations caused
by observational incompleteness, the very shallow SFD of
these objects suggests, in our opinion, that an origin from a
paleo-Eunomia family is not incompatible with the results
of this work.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we:

• Identiﬁed members of the seven old “Broˇz” families in a
new domain of proper elements, gri slope and z ′ − i′ colors.
Once taxonomical and dynamical interlopers were removed,

preliminary estimates of the maximum possible family ages
were obtained.

• Used a “Yarko-YORP” Monte Carlo approach (Car-
ruba et al. 2015) that includes the eﬀects of the stochastic
YORP eﬀect of Bottke et al. (2015) and past changes in
values of the solar luminosity to obtain reﬁned estimates of
the family ages, when possible. Our nominal age estimates
are lower than results of other groups that did not consider
the stochastic YORP eﬀect, as expected, but compatible to
within the uncertainties. Even allowing for the maximum
possible value in the thermal conductivity of the simulated
families, no CX-complex group could have a nominal age
dating from the latest phases of the LHB.

• Simulated with the SY SY CE symplectic integrators
(Carruba et al. 2015) that accounts for the Yarkovsky and

stochastic YORP eﬀects, and past changes in solar luminos-
ity, the dynamical evolution of members of ﬁctitious original
seven “Broˇz” families. Under the assumptions of our model
(no collisional evolution, and an initial SFD with a −α ex-
ponent for the population of objects with 2 < D < 12 km
equal to 3.6), any “paleo-family” that formed between 2.7
and 3.8 Gyr ago would be characterized by a very shallow
size-frequency distribution, a depletion in smallest (D < 5
km) members, and a signiﬁcant spread among the surviv-
ing fragments. Only families in dynamically less active re-
gions, such as the Koronis family in the pristine zone of the
main belt, could have potentially partially survived 3.8 Gyr
of dynamical evolution and not be completely dynamically
eroded. The V-type asteroids in the Eunomia orbital re-
gion are characterized by a very shallow SFD, and could

potentially be compatible with a paleo-Eunomia family, as
suggested in the past (Carruba et al. 2007, 2014b).

and identifying paleo-families remains therefore a very value
line of research in asteroid dynamics.

Overall, the main result of this work is that some paleo-
families, particularly the initially most numerous ones, or
those in dynamically less active parts of the main belt, could
still be visible today, but would be of rather diﬃcult identi-
ﬁcation, especially for the case of families belonging to fairly
typical taxonomical types, such as the C- and S-types. Other
eﬀects not considered in this work, such as collisional cascad-
ing or comminution (Broˇz et al. 2013), close encounters with
massive asteroids (Carruba et al. 2003), secular dynamics in-
volving massive asteroids (Novakovi´c et al. 2015) could all
have contributed to further disperse paleo-family members,
perhaps beyond recognition. Yet the quest for the identiﬁca-
tion of a paleo-family remain, in our opinion, a very worthy
subject of research in asteroid dynamics. If such family could
be found, such as is possibly the case for the V-type aster-
oids in the Eunomia orbital region, it could provide precious
clues about a very early stage of our Solar System. Finding
