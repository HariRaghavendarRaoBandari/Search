We compute the transport coeﬃcients– namely, coeﬃcients of shear and bulk viscosity as well as
thermal conductivity for hot and dense quark matter. The calculations are performed within the
Nambu Jona Lasinio (NJL) model. The estimation of the transport coeﬃcients is made using a quasi
particle approach of solving Boltzmann kinetic equation within the relaxation time approximation.
The transition rates are calculated in a manifestly covariant manner to estimate the thermal averaged
cross sections for quark quark as well as quark anti-quark scattering. The calculations are performed
for ﬁnite chemical potential also. Within the parameters of the model, the ratio of shear viscosity to
entropy density has a minimum at the Mott transition temperature. At vanishing chemical potential,
the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density, on the other hand, decrease with temperature with a
sharp decrease near the critical temperature and vanishes beyond it. At ﬁnite chemical potential,
however, it increases slowly with temperature beyond the Mott temperature. The coeﬃcient of
thermal conductivity also shows a minimum at the critical temperature.

INTRODUCTION

2

Transport properties of hot and dense matter has attracted a lot of attention recently, in the context of relativistic
heavy ion collisions[1], as well as in astrophysical situations such as the early universe[2] and perhaps neutron stars [3].
These properties enter as dissipative coeﬃcients in the hydrodynamic evolution and therefore become an important
ingredient for the near equilibrium evolution of the thermodynamic system. In the context of relativistic heavy ion
collisions, the matter produced at the core of the ﬁre ball is hot enough to have the quarks and gluons as the the
relevant degrees of freedom[4] that behaves like a strongly interacting liquid. This liquid with a small shear viscosity
expands, cools down, and, undergoes a phase transition to a hadronic phase to ﬁnally free stream to the detector.
One of the successful description of this evolution is through relativistic hydrodynamics. A ﬁnite but very small shear
viscosity to entropy ratio (η/s)is necessary to explain the elliptic ﬂow data[5, 6]. The smallness of η/s is signiﬁcant in
connection with the conjunctured lower bound η/s = 1/4π, the ’Kovtun-Son-Starinets’(KSS) bound obtained in the
context of AdS/CFT correspondence[7].

The other viscous coeﬃcient, the coeﬃcient of bulk viscosity (ζ), has recently been realized to be important to
be included in the dissipative hydrodynamics describing the evolution of QGP subsequent to a heavy ion collision.
This is because, the bulk viscosity scales as the trace of the energy momentum tensor and lattice simulations indicate
that the trace of energy momentum tensor can be large near the transition temperature [8]. During the expansion
of the QGP ﬁreball, when the temperature approaches the critical temperature Tc, the bulk viscosity coeﬃcients can
be large and can give rise to diﬀerent interesting phenomena like the phenomenon of cavitation when the pressure
vanishes and the hydrodynamic description of the evolution breaks down [9]. In deed, there have been quite a few
attempts to include the eﬀects of bulk viscosity on particle spectra and ﬂow coeﬃcients[10–12]. Eﬀects of interplay
of shear and bulk viscosity on elliptic ﬂow has been investigated in [13–15]

The transport coeﬃcient that also plays an important role for hydrodynamic evolution at ﬁnite chemical potential is
the thermal conductivity [16–18]. Only recently the eﬀects of thermal conductivity in the relativistic hydrodynamics
in the context of quark gluon plasma is being studied[18, 19].

It is,therefore,desirable that these transport coeﬃcients need to be understood and derived rigorously within a
microscopic theory. They are not only interesting for their use in the hydrodynamic simulations for interpretation of
data generated in heavy ion collision experiments, but also, in some cases through their dependence on the system
parameters like temperature or chemical potential can be indicative of a phase transition. For example, in many
physical systems the coeﬃcient of shear viscosity is a minimum at the phase transition point.
In principle, these
transport coeﬃcients can be estimated directly within QCD using the Kubo formulation[21]. However, QCD being
strongly coupled for the energies accessible for the heavy ion collision experiments, the task becomes complicated .
Calculations with ﬁrst principle lattice simulations at ﬁnite chemical potential is also challenging and is limited to only
the equilibrium properties at small baryon chemical potential [8, 20]. There have been numerous attempts to estimate
shear viscosity within various eﬀective models [22, 24–27, 30, 33] involving diﬀerent approximation schemes like
relaxation time approximation, Chapman-Enskog and the Green Kubo formalism apart from weak coupling QCD[28].
Most of these calculations have been performed with vanishing chemical potentials. There have been attempts to
estimate the transport coeﬃcients using transport codes. The ratio, η/s, in the hadronic phase has been estimated
using UrQMD transport in Ref.[34] while the bulk and shear viscosity coeﬃcients have been estimated using parton
hadron string dynamics(PHSD) transport code within a relaxation time approximation[35]. The rise of bulk viscosity
coeﬃcient near the transition temperature has been observed in various eﬀective models like chiral perturbation
theory[36], quasi particle models[23], linear sigma model[25] as well as Nambu Jona-Lasinio model[37]. Most of these
calculations were performed at vanishing chemical potentials. There have been attempts to compute bulk and shear
viscosity at ﬁnite baryon densities. The ratio η/s at ﬁnite µ was investigated using relativistic Boltzmann equation for
pion nucleon system using phenomenological scattering amplitude [38, 39]. Bulk viscosity at ﬁnite chemical potential
has also been estimated with low energy theorems of QCD[40].

The coeﬃcient of thermal conductivity (λ) for strongly interacting matter has been estimated in diﬀerent theoretical
models. These include using kinetic theory for strongly interacting systems[41], chiral perturbation theory with a pion
gas [42], Chapman-Enskog approximation [43]; Green-Kubo approach within NJL model [44] as well as instanton liquid
model[45]. The results, however, vary over a wide range of values, with λ = 0.008 GeV−2 as in Ref.[42] to λ ∼ 10
GeV−2 as in Ref. [46] for a range of temperature (0.12 GeV <T< 0.17 GeV) as has been nicely tabulated in Ref.[47].
Thermal conductivity has also been calculated for vanishing baryon density but with a conserved pion number in a
pionic medium which can be relevant for heavy ion collision system between kinetic and chemical freeze out[47, 48].
We shall here attempt to estimate these transport coeﬃcients within NJL model. Estimation of the viscosity
coeﬃcients were made in Ref.s[27, 37, 46] for NJL model using a quasi particle approach using Boltzmann kinetic

equation. We follow a similar approach of using the Boltzmann equation within a relaxation time approximation. We
include here the ﬁnite chemical potential eﬀects[37] and also estimate the coeﬃcient of thermal conductivity along
with the coeﬃcients of shear and bulk viscosity. We might mention here that both the medium dependence of the mass
as well as the chemical potential bring out nontrivial contributions to the expressions for the viscosity coeﬃcients,
particularly, for the bulk viscosity. In Ref.[49], the authors discussed three diﬀerent ansatzes for the bulk viscosity
expression in the quasi particle approach when there are mean ﬁeld in the dynamical system and medium dependent
masses. This was further put on a ﬁrmer theoretical ground in Ref.[32]. The crucial observation made here was to
realize that in the ideal hydrodynamics,the entropy per baryon remains constant that restricts the variations of system
parameters like temperature and chemical potential while calculating ﬁrst order deviations. The expressions for the
viscosities turned to be a natural generalization of those at zero baryon density and are explicitly positive deﬁnite as
the dissipative coeﬃcients should be. We shall use here a similar approach to derive the expressions for the transport
coeﬃcients within NJL model.

We organize the present work as follows. In the following section we discuss the 2-ﬂavor NJL model thermody-
namics. We also recapitulate the medium dependence of masses of the pion and sigma mesons here as these are
needed to estimate the scattering amplitudes of the quarks and anti quarks through meson exchange to estimate the
relaxation time. In section III, we discuss the expressions for the shear and bulk viscosity within the relaxation time
approximation. In the next subsection we give here the explicit calculations for estimation of transition rates at ﬁnite
temperature and density so as to estimate the medium averaged relaxation time. In section 4, we give the results.
Finally, in section V we summaries our ﬁndings and give a possible outlook.

II. THERMODYNAMICS OF TWO FLAVOR NJL MODEL AND MESON MASSES

We summarize here the thermodynamics of the simplest NJL model with two ﬂavors with a four point interaction

in the scalar and pseudo scalar channels with Lagrangian given as

L = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ − m0)ψ − G(cid:0)( ¯ψψ)2 + ( ¯ψiγ5taψ)2(cid:1) .

(1)

Here, ψ is the doublet of u and d quarks. We also have assumed isospin symmetry and have taken the same
(current)mass m0 for both the ﬂavors. Using the standard methods of thermal ﬁeld theory, one can write down the
thermodynamic potential within a mean ﬁeld approximation corresponding to the Lagrangian Eq.(1) as[52]

The medium dependent masses of these mesons, so obtained, will be used later to estimate the relaxation time of
from the scattering of quarks and anti quarks through exchange of mesons.In the following we look into the Boltzmann
equation to derive the transport coeﬃcients in terms of the relaxation time.

III. BOLTZMANN EQUATION IN RELAXATION TIME APPROXIMATION AND TRANSPORT

COEFFICIENTS.

Within a quasi particle approximation, a kinetic theory treatment for calculation of transport coeﬃcient can be a
reasonable approximation that we shall be following similar to as done in Ref.s[22, 25, 28, 29, 50]. The plasma can
be described by a phase space density for for each species of particle. Near equilibrium, the distribution function can
be expanded about a local equilibrium distribution function for the quarks as,

where, the local equilibrium distribution function f 0 is given as

f (x, p, t) = f 0(x, p, t) + f 1(x, p, t)

f 0(x, p, t) = [exp (β(x) (uν(x)pν ∓ µ(x))) + 1]−1

(14)

Here, u is the ﬂow velocity, µ is the chemical potential associated with a conserved charge like baryon number.∓µ
corresponds to particle and antiparticle distribution functions.Further, E = pp2 + M 2 with a mass M which in
general is medium dependent. The departure from the equilibrium is described by the Boltzmann equation

dfa

+ va · ∇fa − ∇Ea · ∇pfa = −Ca[f ]

(15)

where, we have introduced the species index ’a’ on the distribution function. With a medium dependent mass, the
last term on the left hand side can be written as (M/Ea)(∂m/∂xi)(∂f a/∂pi) and the Eq. (15) can be re-casted as

dfa

∂µf a −

∂pi = −Ca[f ]

(16)

To study the transport coeﬃcients, one is interested in small departure from equilibrium in the hydrodynamic limit
of slow spatial and temporal variations. In the collision term on the right hand side we shall be limiting ourselves
to 2 → 2 scatterrings only. Within the relaxation time approximation, in the collision term for specie’s’, all the
distribution functions are given by the equilibrium distribution function except the distribution function for particle
’a’. The collision term, to ﬁrst order in the deviation from equilibrium function will be then proportional to f1 ,
realizing the fact that Ca[feq] = 0 by local detailed balance. In that case, the collision term is given by

C[f ] = −f 1

a /τa

(17)

τ a, the relaxation time for particle ’a’, in general is a function of energy but one can deﬁne a mean relaxation time
taking a thermal average of the scattering cross sections which we shall spell out in the following subsection.

We shall next use the Boltzmann equation to calculate the transport coeﬃcients in this relaxation time approxima-
tion. The departure from equilibrium for the distribution function is used to estimate the departure of the equilibrium
energy momentum tensor to deﬁne the transport coeﬃcients. Let us consider now the structure of the energy momen-
tum tensor T µν and of the quark current Jµ. T µν and Jµ can be written in terms of chemical potential, temperature
and the four velocity uµ as

and,

T µν = −pgµν + wuµuν + ∆T µν,

Jµ = nuµ + ∆Jµ,

(18)

(19)

where, p(T, µ) is the pressure, ǫ is the energy density, w = ǫ + p is the enthalpy, uµ is the four velocity of the ﬂuid.
The dissipative parts are given by

and,

∆T µν = η(cid:18)Dµuν + Dνuµ +

(21)

with η,ζ and λ are the coeﬃcients of shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity respectively. Further, in
the above, Dµ = ∂µ − uµuα∂α is the derivative normal to uµ. It is useful to note that,in the ﬂuid rest frame, which
will be used to calculate the transport coeﬃcients, D0 = 0 and Di = ∂i. We also would like to note that for system
without any conserved current, the thermal conductivity is zero [42, 51].

The energy momentum tensor, T µν and the current Jµ can also be written in terms of the distribution functions

as,

where, we have introduced the notations dΓa = ga

(2π)3 , ga being the degeneracy for species a; pµ = (Ea, p), with
Ea = pp2 + m2
a. Further, V is the mean ﬁeld or the ‘vacuum’ energy density contribution in terms of the mean ﬁeld
giving a medium dependent mass and ta = ±1 for particles and antiparticles respectively. The non equilibrium part

of the distribution function is used to calculate the departure from equilibrium of the energy momentum tensor. The
variation of the spatial part of Eq.(22) is given as

Ea (cid:19) − δij δV,

(24)

where, the variation of the quasi particle energy is also included to take into account the medium dependence of the
mass. The deviation of the distribution function,in general, will have departure from the equilibrium form. In addition
it can also change from the change in the single particle energy from its equilibrium value.Deﬁning the equilibrium
values of T ,µ and E with a superscript 0, we can write

δfa = fa(Ea, T, µ) − f 0

a (E0

(25)

where, we have deﬁned δ ˜fa = fa(Ea, T, µ) − fa(Ea, T0, µ0) and have retained up to the linear term in δEa. Let us
note that it is δ ˜fa which determines the transport coeﬃcient as it is deﬁned with the non equilibrium energy, which
enters in the energy momentum conservation in the collision term of the Boltzmann equation.

Similarly, using the gap equation, the deviations in the ’vacuum’ energy term in Eq.(22) is given by

(27)

where, we have replaced pipj ∼ 1/3(p2) and for the terms involving δea, we have used,δEa = (M/Ea)δM . The terms
involving δM in Eq.(27) can be shown to vanish by doing a integration by parts leading to

∆T ij = Xa Z dΓa

δ ˜f .

(28)

In a similar manner, it can be shown that the departure of the quark current due to the non equilibrium part of

the distribution function can be written as

(29)

Next, we compute δ ˜fa ≡ f 1(x, p) using the Boltzmann equation, Eq.(16), in the relaxation time approximation. This
is then used to calculate non equilibrium parts of energy momentum tensor and the quark current to ﬁnally relate them
to the transport equations using Eq.s(20) and Eq.(21). To do so, it is convenient to analyze in a local region choosing
an appropriate rest frame. We further note that we shall be working with ﬁrst order hydrodynamics and hence will
keep up to ﬁrst order in space time gradients only. The left hand side of the Boltzmann equation Eq.(16),is explicitly
small because of the gradients and we therefore may replace f a by f a
0 . In the local rest frame uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0), but, the
gradients of the velocities are nonzero. Further, in the local equilibrium distribution function f 0
a in Eq.(14), the ﬂow
velocity, temperature and chemical potential all depend upon x. In addition, the four momentum pa also depends
upon the coordinate x through the dependence of mass on the same. We give here some details of the calculations of
the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation. To do so, let us calculate the derivative of the equilibrium distribution
function Eq.(14) given as

Next using the fact that uνuν = 1, one can show that, in the local rest frame, ∂νu0 = 0. This can be used to expand
the term with gradient of ﬂow velocity Eq.(31) in terms of spatial and temporal derivatives of the ﬂow velocity ui.
Combining both Eq.(31) and Eq.(32), LHS of Eq.(16), is given as,

(33)

Next, we can use the conservation equation ∂µT µν = 0 to write ∂0ui = ∂iP in the rest frame . Using thermodynamic
relations ∂iP = s∂iT + n∂iµ to write (∂iT )/T − ∂0ui = −(nT /w)∂i(µ/T ). Further, the spatial derivative of the ﬂow
velocity can be decomposed in to a traceless part and a divergence part in the ﬂow velocity.

This leads to

The Boltzmann equation Eq.(34) thus relates the non equilibrium part of the distribution functions to the variation
in ﬂuid velocity,the temperature and the chemical potential. This will be used to calculate the dissipative part of the
energy momentum tensor.

Using stress energy conservation ∂µT µν = 0; the baryon number conservation equation ∂µJ µ = 0, as well as
standard thermodynamic relations, one can relate the temporal derivatives of temperature and chemical potentials
with the velocity of sound at constant baryon density and constant entropy density respectively as

and

∂0T = −v2

In the NJL model one can explicitly calculate the derivatives of the energy density with temperature or chemical

The contribution of the the term proportional to gradient of (µ/T ) term in Eq.(43) vanishes because of symmetry.
On comparison of the resulting expression with the tensor structure of the dissipative part of ∆T µν of Eq.(28), we
have the expressions for the shear viscosity coeﬃcient η as

The above arises due to to the fact that the variations of temperature and chemical potential are not independent
variations. They and are related by the hydrodynamic ﬂow of the matter which occurs at constant entropy per baryon
σ = s/n [32]. Further, we have introduced the notation[49]

hφa(p)i = Z dΓa[φa(p)f 0

a (1 − f 0

a )].

If the variations as in Eq.(42) do not satisfy the the Landau-Lifshitz conditions Eq.(52) and Eq.(53), one may still

fulﬁll them performing a shift[32, 49]

where, αn and αe are the Lagrange multipliers associated with conservation of baryon number and energy. Performing
the substitution Eq.(57) in Eq. (52) and Eq.(53) we have the Landau-Lifshitz conditions given as

In passing, we would like to comment here that the expression for thermal conductivity is identical to as derived in
Ref. [42] discussed for a hot pion gas within chiral perturbation theory, when one replaces the rate by inverse of the
width and fermion distribution functions for the quarks by the bose distribution functions for pions.

Thus all the dissipative coeﬃcients are explicitly positive deﬁnite within the relaxation time approximation. The
expression for the bulk viscosity reduces to the expression for the same in the limit of vanishing density to that of
Ref.[25]. Further, the expression also reduces to the expression for bulk viscosity in Ref[53] when medium dependence
of the single particle energy is taken into account . Eq.(46), Eq.(62) and Eq.(63) for the dissipation coeﬃcients shall
be the focus of our the discussion in what follows. Let us note that in these equations so far, the unknown quantity
is the estimation of the relaxation time τ a. As mentioned earlier, τ a, in general, will be energy dependent but we
shall be taking energy averaged estimation of the relaxation time by taking thermal averaging of the scattering cross
section.

A. Transition rates and thermal averaging

The key quantity in estimating the transport coeﬃcient within the relaxation time approximation is the thermal

averaged transition rate ¯W . The same e.g. for a general fermion fermion scattering process a, b → c, d is given as

¯Wab =

1

nanb Z dπadπbf a(pa)f b(pb)Wab(s)

(64)

In the above, fi are the distribution functions for the fermions and dπi = (1/(2π)3)dpi/2Ei, ni = (gi/(2π)3)R dpif (pi)

is the number density of i-th species with degeneracy gi. Further, the quantity Wab(s) is dimensionless, Lorentz
invariant and is dependent only on the mandelstam variable s and is given as

Wab(s) =

1

1 + δab Z dπcdπd(2π)4δ4(pa + pb − pc − pd)| ¯M|2(1 − fc(pc))(1 − fd(pd)).

(65)

Here, we have included the Pauli blocking factors. The quantity Wab(s) can be related to the cross section by

noting that

pab| ¯M|2

(66)

where pab = p(s − 4m2)/2 is the magnitude of the three momentum of the incoming particles in the center of mass

(CM) frame if the masses of the particles are the same. Thus in the CM frame,we have, using the delta function and
integrating over the ﬁnal momenta

Wab(s) =

where, we have tmin = −(s − 4m2) for non identical particle case and tmin = −1/2(s − 4m2) for identical particles in
the ﬁnal state.

Once Wab is calculated as a function of s, one has to do the thermal averaging of the transition rate using Eq.(64)

. To perform the integration over dπadπb in Eq.(64), we note that the volume element dpadpb is given by

dpadpb = 4π|pa|Ea4π|pb|Eb

1
2

d(cos θ)

(68)

where, θ is the angle between the three momenta pa and pb It is somewhat convenient to change the integration
variables from Ea, Eb, θ to E+, E−, s given by

E+ = Ea + Eb, E− = Ea − Eb

s = 2m2 + 2EaEb − 2|pa||pb| cos θ

so that the volume element becomes

dpadpb = 2π2EaEbdE+dE−ds

(69)

The integration region (E1 > m, E2 > m,| cos θ| ≤ 1) transforms into

|E−| < X, E+ ≥ √s,

s ≥ 4m2

. where, X = q1 − 4m2
+ − s. It is then possible to perform the integration over the variable E− analytically
when the distribution functions in Eq.(64) are fermionic distribution functions f (x) = (1 + exp(βx − µ))−1. Thus the

The thermal relaxation time for each species is then given as [54]

where, the summation runs over all species of quarks and ¯Wab is the sum of the transition rates of all processes with

One can use i-spin symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry as well as the crossing symmetry to relate the matrix
element square for the above 12 processes to get related to each other and one has to evaluate only two independent
matrix elements to evaluate all these 12 processes. We can choose as in Ref.[27]) these to be the processes u¯u → u¯u
and u ¯d → u ¯d and use the symmetry conditions to calculate the rest. We note however that while the matrix elements
are related the thermal averaged rates are not as they involve also the thermal distribution functions for the initial
states as well as the Pauli blocking factors for the ﬁnal states. The corresponding matrix element square are written
down in Ref.[31] which we do not repeat here.

The 2 ﬂavor NJL model as given in Eq.(1), within which we shall be discussing the results, has there parameters–

equation, and, the integrals involving meson masses and the current quark mass m which we take to be the same for
u and di quarks. Within the mean ﬁeld approximation for the thermodynamic potential, and the RPA approximation
for the meson masses, these three parameters are ﬁxed by ﬁtting the pion mass , the pion decay constant and the
quark condensate. While the pion mass mπ = 135 MeV [55] and pion decay constant fπ = 92.4a MeV[56] are known
somewhat accurately, the uncertainties in the quark condensates are rather large. Whereas, extraction from QCD
sum rules turn out to be in the range 190 MeV< −h¯uui1/3 < 260 MeV ( at renormalisation scale of 1GeV) [57],
extraction from lattice simulation turns out to be −h¯uui1/3 ∼ 231 MeV [58]. We have used the parameter set here
m = 5.6 MeV, Λ=587.9 MeV and GΛ2 = 2.44. This leads to the vacuum value of the constituent quark mass to be
M ≃ 400 MeV, while the condensate value as −h¯uui1/3 = 241 MeV.
coeﬃcients.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the thermodynamics of the two ﬂavor NJL model as relevant for the calculation of the transport

With the parameters as above, the gap equation is ﬁrst solved using Eq.(3) for a given temperature and chemical
potential. This is then used to solve for the masses of the pion and sigma masses using Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) within
the random phase approximation. In Fig.(1a), we have plotted the constituent quark mass, and the meson masses so
derived as a function of temperature for µ = 0. There is a crossover from low temperature region where there is a
large diﬀerence between the pion and sigma meson masses while at high temperature, they become degenerate. and
increase linearly with temperature. The constituent quark mass decrease to a small values but never vanishes.a The
chiral crossover transition Tχ turns out to be about 188 MeV for µ = 0 and about 180 MeV for µ = 100 MeV. These
are deﬁned by the peak in the derivative of the constituent mass (dM/dT ) which we have shown in Fig.(1b). Let
us note here that the constituent mass at Tχ turns out to be about 145 MeV. On the other hand, one can have the
other characteristic temperature namely, the Mott temperature TM deﬁned through the mπ(TM ) = 2M (TM ) i.e. the
temperature when the twice the constituent quark mass become equal to that of the pion mass. As may be observed
in Fig.1-a the Mott temperature for pions is about 197 MeV. This temperature is relevant in the present case where
we estimate the relaxation time using quark scattering involving meson exchange.

Next, we show, in Fig 2-a, the temperature dependence of the square of the velocity of sound v2

n = (dp/de)n at
constant quark number density as deﬁned in Eq.(38). The velocity of sound do not show any dip around the critical
temperature Tχ, but rises around the critical temperature and approaches the value of 1
3 at high temperatures. In
Fig. 2-b , we show the dependence of speciﬁc heat CV ≡ (dǫ/dT )µ scaled by T 3. This quantity shows a peak at TC

and which occurs at lower temperature as the density is increased. At high temperature however, CV /T 3 approaches
a constant at small chemical potential. We would like to mention that the behavior of velocity of sound is shows
diﬀerent behavior as compared to lattice simulations [8] where it shows a minimum and then rises to a value little
less than the ideal gas limit of 1/3 . The present results for the sound velocity is similar in nature to linear sigma
model calculations of Ref.[25] with a lighter sigma meson of mass about 600 MeV. The behavior of speciﬁc heat is
also similar to as observed in Ref[25]. This behavior, as we shall observe later, gets reﬂected in the results for the
bulk viscosity.

Next, we discuss the estimation of averaged relaxation time as a function of temperature. Let us recall that this
quantity is inversely related to the transition rate ¯Wabnb as in Eq.(71) with Wabis the transition rate of all processes
with species a,b in the the initial states and is related to the corresponding scattering cross section as in Eq.(67). In
general, the dominant contribution here comes from quark anti-quark scattering from s channel through propagation
of the resonance states, the pions and the sigma. The mass of sigma meson decrease with increase in temperature
becoming a minimum at the Mott transition temperature TM leading to an enhancement of the cross section. This,
in turn, leads to a minimum in the relaxation time. Beyond the transition temperature the resonance masses increase
with temperature linearly leading to a smaller cross section and hence an increase in the relaxation time beyond the
critical temperature. This generic feature is observed in Fig.3-a.

Let us note the τ depends both on the transition rate and the density of the particles of the initial state other
than the species ‘a′. It turns out that the transition rate is dominant for the process u ¯d → u ¯d. At ﬁnite chemical
potential, for temperatures greater than the transition temperature, quark density is larger compared to the anti
quarks. As there are fewer anti quarks to scatter oﬀ , the cross section for quark-antiquary scattering decreases
leading to τ (µ) > τ (µ = 0). On the other hand, for anti-quarks, there are more quarks to scatter oﬀ at nonzero µ as
compared to at µ = 0. This leads to a lower value for relaxation time for the anti quark at ﬁnite µ as compared to µ = 0
case. On the other hand, for temperatures below the critical temperature, while the quark-anti quark transition rate
is dominant, the density of anti quark is suppressed very much by the constituent quark mass for µ 6= 0. The quark
number density however is enhanced contribution from quark quark scattering becomes more important resulting in
a smaller value for the relaxation time at ﬁnite µ compared to µ = 0 case. In Fig(3-b) we have plotted the shear
viscosity to entropy ratio ( eta
s ) as a function of temperature for µ = 0M eV and µ = 100M eV . As expected from
the τ behavior with temperature, η/s has a minimum at the critical temperature beyond which it increase slowly.
At ﬁnite µ η/s is larger as compared to vanishing µ. This is due to two reasons. Firstly, τ at ﬁniteµ is larger and,

In Fig. (4) we show the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density ( ζ

viscosity increases rapidly near the critical temperature as temperature decrease from high temperature beyond the
critical temperature to temperatures below it. However, it is not a maximum at the critical temperature. After the
rapid rise near critical temperature it increases slowly. Let us note that one can rewrite the expression for the bulk
viscosity as

At zero baryon density, bulk viscosity depends quadratically upon the violation of conformality measures C1 =
1 − 3v2
dT [25]. The behavior of these two parameters are plotted as a function of temperature
in Fig (5). For comparison, we have also plotted the corresponding quantities at non zero µ. As may be observed, ζ/s
is largest when the violation of conformality is large. At ﬁnite baryon density, (1 − v2
n) does not vanish nor the factor
(∂P/∂n)ǫ as a result of which the ratio ζ/s does not vanish unlike µ = 0 case. The behavior of bulk viscosity is similar
qualitatively to that of linear sigma model of Ref.[25]. Our results regarding the ratio η/s qualitatively look similar as
compared to that of Ref.[37]. However, the bulk viscosity to entropy ratio look diﬀerent as we have implemented the
Landau Lifshitz matching conditions explicitly leading to diﬀerent expression for ζ. This apart, while estimating the
average relaxation time we have used the transition rate calculated in a covariant manner similar to Ref.[31] where as
Ref.[37] uses a probability distribution to calculate the thermal averaged cross section similar to [27]. look diﬀerent

Finally, in Fig. (6) we have plotted thermal conductivity of quark matter at µ = 100M eV in units of T 2. As may be
noted, the ratio λ/T 2 shows a non monotonic behavior with a minimum at the critical temperature. The origin of this
again is related to the minimum of the relaxation time at the critical temperature. The present behavior is in contrast

to the same obtained in Ref.
[46] where the same ratio shows a monotonically decreasing function of temperature.
The behavior of λ/T 2 was also studied in Ref.[43] where, the ratio showed a increasing behavior with temperature
with however a slower rise with temperature as compared to the results shown in Fig. 6. Thermal conductivity was
also estimated for within chiral perturbation theory for hot pion gas in Ref.[42]. The variation of thermal conductivity
here is also non monotonic with temperature. Within the Green Kubo approach, thermal conductivity was estimated
for two ﬂavors using NJL model[44] as well as in Ref.[45] within the instanton liquid model where however the thermal
conductivity saturates beyond T=150 MeV in contrast to the present calculation.

V. SUMMARY

We have attempted here to compute the transport coeﬃcient in NJL model. The approach uses solving the
Boltzmann kinetic equation within relaxation time approximation. To estimate the relaxation time we have considered
the quark , anti quark two body scatterrings through exchange of pion and sigma resonances. Since the meson masses
are minimum at the transition temperatures beyond which they are degenerate and increase linear with temperature,
the meson propagator occurring in the transition amplitude lead to a large contribution to the cross section for the
quark, anti quark scattering. This eventually leads to a smaller relaxation time which, in turn, lead to a minimum in
the temperature dependence of the relaxation time. While computing the averaged relaxation time we have performed
the procedure in a manifestly covariant manner as in Ref [31], rather than multiplying an ad hoc probability function
to estimate the thermal averaged cross section [27]. We have used the expressions for the transport coeﬃcients that
are manifestly positive deﬁnite as they should be. The expression for shear viscosity only depends on the relaxation
time and the distribution functions. However, both the expressions for the coeﬃcients of bulk viscosity and thermal
conductivity involve equation of state. The expressions for the transport coeﬃcients are direct generalization of their
counterparts at zero chemical potential [32]. All the three transport coeﬃcients are minimum at the Mott temperature.
For the estimation of the relaxation time we have only included the two body scattering. One can generalize
this to include decay processes involving the mesons decaying to a pair of quarks and anti quarks[59, 60]. We have
investigated here temperature dependence of the transport coeﬃcients in relation to the chiral transition in quark
matter. It would be interesting to study the interplay of chiral and deconﬁnement transition using a Polyakov loop
NJL model. Some of these calculations are in progress and will be reported elsewhere.
