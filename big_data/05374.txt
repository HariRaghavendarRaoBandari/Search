One of classical boundary problems of the kinetic theory (a problem about
thermal sliding) of the rareﬁed gas along a ﬂat ﬁrm surface is considered.
Kinetic Boltzmann equation with model integral of collisions BGK (Bhatnagar,
Gross, Krook) is used. As boundary conditions the boundary Maxwell conditions
(mirror-diﬀuse) are used. The generalized method of a source is applied to the
problem decision. Comparison with earlier received results is spent.

Key words: thermal sliding, rareﬁed gas, accommodation coeﬃcient,
kinetic equation, Fredholm equation, distribution function, Neumann
series.

(not necessarily ﬂat) causes constant interest (see, for example, [4]-

[12]. It is related both to rarely theoretical interest and with numerous
applications in area of aerodynamics and physics of the aero dispersible
systems. The most complete review of works in this direction is presented

in work [4] and the monograph [5]. We note a number of works [6]-[9],
mirror-boundary conditions were examined in that. A great contribution
to the study of thermal sliding brought Loyalka S. K. [7]-[9]. In our

works [10]-[15] were worked out approximation [10]-[12] and exact [13,
14] methods of solution of boundary value problems for model kinetic
equations. In works [10], [11] the coeﬃcient of thermal sliding is app-

roximated by fractional rational functions. Analytical solution of the
problem on thermal sliding for a gas with frequency of collisions propor-
tional to the modulus of the speed of molecules, and diﬀuse boundary

value problems, it was got in [15]. Then in works [16]-[18] thermal sliding
was considered for quantum gases.

1. Statement problem

Let the rareﬁed gas ﬁlls a half-space x > 0 and moves along an axis

y. Far from a surface (y, z) the logarithmic gradient of temperature

gT =(cid:18)d ln T (y)

dy (cid:19)x=+∞

is set.

It is required to ﬁnd the speed of thermal sliding usl = uy(+∞) and

distribution of mass speed of gas uy = uy(x) in a half-space.

In work [12] it is shown that if to search the function of distribution

in the form

where

f (t, r, v) = fM (v)(1 + h(t, r, v)),

fM (r, v, t) = n(y)(cid:16) m

T (y) = T0(1 + gT y),

then function h(x, µ) (µ = Cx) satisﬁes to the nonhomogeneous kinetic
equation

,

y1 = νpβy,

x1 = νpβx,
Usl =pβusl,

ν is the frequency of collisions, x1, y1 is the dimensionless coordinates,
k is the Boltzmann constant.

Further we will consider that x1 ≡ x, y1 ≡ y.
We will consider that molecules are reﬂected from a wall mirror-

diﬀuse

f (t, +0, v) = qf0(v) + (1 − q)f (t, +0, −vx, vy, vz),

vx > 0,

(1.2)

where q is the accomodation coeﬃcient (coeﬃcient of diﬀusively), 0 6
q 6 1.

At the q = 1 condition (1.2) is a condition of diﬀuse reﬂection, at

q = 0 is the condition of a specular reﬂection.

For function h(x, µ) the condition (1.2) passes into the condition

h(0, µ) = (1 − q)h(0, −µ),

µ > 0.

(1.3)

Far from a wall function of distribution turns into the Champen(cid:22)

Enskog distribution

We will designate further

h(∞, µ) = 2Usl − GT(cid:16)µ2 −
h(x, µ) + GT(cid:16)µ2 −

2(cid:17).
2(cid:17) = ψ(x, µ).

Then the equation (1.1) passes into the homogeneous equation

2(cid:17) + (1 − q)ψ(0, −µ),

and

µ > 0,

(1.6)

ψ(0, µ) = 2Usl.

(1.7)

Further we will put

ψ(x, µ) + 2Usl + hc(x, µ).

Thus function satisﬁes to the equation (1.5)

µ > 0, (1.9)

(1.10)

2. Inclusion of boundary conditions in the kinetic equation

We will continue function of distribution to the interfaced half-space

x < 0 by symmetric character

h(x, µ) = h(−x, −µ),

µ > 0.

At such extension the function hc(x, µ) in negative half-space x < 0

satisﬁes to equation (1.8) again and to the boundary conditions

hc(−0, µ) =

= −2qUsl + qGT(cid:16)µ2 −

and

1

2(cid:17) + (1 − q)hc(−0, −µ),
hc(−∞, µ) = 0.

µ < 0,

(2.1)

(2.2)

We will include boundary conditions (1.9), (1.10) and (2.1) (2.2) in

the kinetic equation in the form of a source, which member contains

(2.3)

(2.4)

We will notice that Uc(x) = 0 satisﬁes to the boundary conditions

Uc(±∞) = 0.

(2.5)

For the equation (2.3) at x > 0, µ < 0, we get the solution satisfying

to the boundary conditions (1.9) and (2.5)

(2.7)

We will rewrite the equation (2.3), and we will replace in it the last

member, using continuation of function h(x, µ) on the interfaced half-
space and equalities (2.6) and (2.7). On this way we come to the following
equation

5. Discussion of results and conclusions

We will compare the got results to previous. In particular, with
the precise decision for the speed of thermal sliding at q = 1: Usl =
0.38316GT (see [12]).

We will rewrite this formula in the dimensional form: usl = 1.1495ζgT .
Here ζ is the kinematic viscosity of gas.
According to the got results the dimensionless speed of the thermal

sliding is equal

Usl(q) =

1
2

(V0 + V1q + V2q2)GT = 0.5(0.5 + 0.2857q − 0.0211q2)GT .

We will bring this formula over to the dimensional form

usl(q) = 0.75(1 + 0.5714q − 0.0422q2)ζgT .

(5.1)

In the zero approximation from a formula (5.1) it is visible that we
received exact result of Maxwell for mirror boundary conditions: usl =
0.75ζgT .

We will introduce the relative error

· 100%,
where usl(q) is determined by the equality (5.1).

On(q) =

usl − usl(q)

usl

(5.2)

In the ﬁrst approximation the speed of the thermal sliding is equal

u(1)
sl (q) = 0.75(0.5 + 0.2857q)ζgT ,

in the second approximation it is determined by equality (5.1)

u(2)
sl (q) = 0.75(1 + 0.5714q − 0.0422q2)ζgT .

It is easy to see that the relative error is equal in a zero approximation
O0(1) = 34.48%, in the ﬁrst it is equal O1(1) = 2.52%, in the second it
is equal O2(1) = 0.23%.

13

Comparing the brought estimations over, we come to the conclusion

that exactly the nonlinear analysis leads to an eﬃcient approximating
formula for the calculation of the speed of the thermal sliding.

We will rewrite a formula (5.1) to the form usl(q) = K(q)ζgT , where
K(q) is the coeﬃcient of the thermal sliding. Let us compare our coef-
ﬁcient from this work with the coeﬃcients found in [6]-[8]. The same
coeﬃcient was found in works [6] and [7]: K(q) = 0.75(1 + 0.5q). In

work [8] it was obtained that K(q) = 0.75(0.5321 + q). The comparison
of this coeﬃcient with (5.1) according to (5.2) shows that at q = 1
the coeﬃcient deviation from [6] and [7] does not exceed 0.2% from the

coeﬃcient received in work.

Thus, in work eﬃcient approximating formulas for the solution of
the problem on thermal sliding with mirror-diﬀuse boundary conditions

are removed. Further authors intend to consider the problem of thermal
sliding for quantum gases.
