SHAPES OF POLYNOMIAL JULIA SETS, REVISITED

KATHRYN A. LINDSEY

Abstract. Any ﬁnite union of disjoint, mutually exterior Jordan curves
in the complex plane can be approximated arbitrarily well in the Haus-
dorﬀ topology by polynomial Julia sets. Furthermore, the proof is con-
structive.

1. Introduction

It was shown in [9] that any ﬁnite union of disjoint mutually exterior Jor-
dan curves can be approximated arbitrarily well in the Hausdorﬀ topology
by Julia sets of rational maps (and any single Jordan curve can be approx-
imated by polynomial Julia sets). Here, we give a constructive proof that
any such ﬁnite union of Jordan curves can be approximated by Julia sets of
polynomials.
Theorem 1.1. Let E be any ﬁnite union of disjoint Jordan domains in C.
For any  > 0, there exists a polynomial P such that

d (E,K(P )) < ,

d (∂E,J (P )) < ,

and d( ˆC \ E, ˆC \ K(P )) < .

Here, K(P ) denotes the ﬁlled Julia set for P (i.e. K(P ) = {z ∈ C : P m(z) (cid:57)
∞ as m → ∞}), J (P ) = ∂K(P ) is the Julia set for P , and d is the Hausdorﬀ
metric.

Approximation by Julia sets or other dynamically signiﬁcant sets has been
the focus of several recent works (e.g.
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]). A feature of the
construction presented in this article and [9] that is absent from [2, 3, 5, 6] is
that the ﬁlled Julia set, as well as the Julia set, can be made to approximate
some desired shape. Closeness in the Hausdorﬀ metric of a Julia set to a
collection of Jordan curves does not imply closeness of the associated ﬁlled
Julia set to the region bounded by those curves. Approximating shapes by
ﬁlled Julia sets has applications to computer graphics ([7]).

2. Polynomials approximating logarithmic potential

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the Jordan domains The-
orem 1.1 are bounded by smooth Jordan curves. Let E be the union of
ﬁnitely many disjoint Jordan domains in C bounded by smooth Jordan
curves. Write Ω = ˆC \ E and Γ = ∂E.

We will deﬁne a family of polynomials Sn,δ indexed by n ∈ N and δ > 0.
The polynomial Sn,δ will have n roots in Γ, distributed according to har-
monic measure relative to ∞, and |Sn,δ| is an approximation of the log-
arithmic potential of this measure, scaled by a real constant governed by
δ.
For background on harmonic measure and potential theory, see, for ex-
ample, [4]. Harmonic measure relative to ∞, which we will denote by µ∞,
is a Borel probability measure supported on Γ that is (recall we assume Γ
consists of smooth curves) absolutely continuous with respect to arclength.
The density of harmonic measure relative to a point w ∈ Ω with respect to
arclength at a point ζ ∈ Γ is given by the Poisson kernel, Pw(ζ) = −1
,
where g(w,·) is the Green’s function with a pole at w and nζ is the unit outer
normal to Γ at ζ. For w ∈ Ω, the Green’s function g(w,·) : ˆC → R is the
unique function such that g(w,·) = 0 on E ∪ Γ, g(w,·) > 0 on the interior of
Ω, ζ (cid:55)→ g(w, ζ) is harmonic on Ω \ {w}, and ζ (cid:55)→ g(w, ζ) − log
1|w−ζ| is har-
monic at w. Harmonic measure for more general sets may be deﬁned using
probabilistic techniques, viewing harmonic measure as the hitting measure
of Brownian motion, as in, for example, [8].

The logarithmic potential of the harmonic measure µ∞ is the function

In our situation (i.e. Γ consists of ﬁnitely many smooth Jordan curves and
Ω is connected), Uµ∞ is absolutely convergent and continuous on C and

(1)

Uµ∞(z) = γ − g(∞, z)

for all

z ∈ C,

where γ is a real number associated to E (Robin’s constant for E).

We must specify the meaning of “approximately equidistributed” in Theo-
rem 2.1. If Γ consists of more than one Jordan curve, it will typically be
impossible to divide Γ into n connected curves which each are of precisely
µ∞-measure 1/n. However, by taking n to be suﬃciently large, we can

choose the set {ζ n

approximately equidistributed with respect to µ∞ if for any  > 0, there ex-
ists N ∈ N such that for n ≥ N , cutting Γ at the points {ζ n

For z (cid:54)∈ Γ, z (cid:54)= ∞, the function log |ζ − z| is ﬁnite and continuous on Γ (cid:51) ζ.

Proposition 3.1. Assume 0 ∈ E, and let E(cid:48) be a compact subset of E

Then there exists D > 0 such that for any 0 < δ ≤ D, there exists a natural
number N (δ) such that n ≥ N (δ) implies E(cid:48) ⊂ K(Pn,δ) and Ω(cid:48) ⊂ ˆC\K(Pn,δ)

Proof. Fix r > 0 small enough that Br(0) ⊂ E(cid:48). Fix a real number m > 0
such that

m <

sup{|z| : z ∈ E(cid:48)} .

Fix R > 0 large enough that ˆC\ BR(0) ⊂ Ω(cid:48). Fix a real number M > 1 such
that

M >

inf{|z| : z ∈ Ω(cid:48)} .

We now show that there exists D > 0 such that for any 0 < δ ≤ D, there
exists N (δ) ∈ N such that n ≥ N (δ) implies |Sn,δ(z)| < m for all z ∈ E(cid:48)
and |Sn,δ(z)| > M for all z ∈ Ω(cid:48). Recall that g(∞, z) = 0 for z ∈ E ∪ Γ and
g(∞, z) > 0 for z in the interior of Ω. Since Ω(cid:48) is a compact subset of the
interior of Ω, there exists D > 0 such that g(∞, z) > D for all z ∈ Ω(cid:48). Let

r

R

α = inf

z∈Ω(cid:48){g(∞, z) − D}.

(eα/2)n ≤ |Sn,δ(z)|

Notice α > 0 by compactness of Ω(cid:48). Using  = α/2, by equation (5), there
exists N0 ∈ N such that n ≥ N0 and 0 < δ ≤ D imply

for all z ∈ Ω(cid:48). The sets

{z ∈ Ω(cid:48) : (eα/2)k > M for all integers k ≥ n}, n ∈ N,

form a countable open cover of Ω(cid:48); by compactness, this cover admits a ﬁnite
subcover. Hence there exists N1 ∈ N such that n ≥ N1 and 0 < δ ≤ D imply
|Sn,δ(z)| > M for all z ∈ Ω(cid:48). Now for any ﬁxed 0 < δ ≤ D, using  = δ/2
in equation (5), there exists N2 ∈ N such that |Sn,δ(z)| < (e−δ/2)n for all
z ∈ E(cid:48) and n ≥ N2. Pick N2 to be large enough that (e−δ/2)N2 < m. Set
N (δ) = max{N1, N2}.

Now ﬁx 0 < δ ≤ D and let n ≥ N (δ). For z ∈ E(cid:48),

|Pn,δ(z)| = |z| · |Sn,δ(z)| ≤ sup{|z| : z ∈ E(cid:48)} · m < r.

Hence z ∈ E(cid:48) implies Pn,δ(z) ∈ E(cid:48), and thus E(cid:48) ⊂ K(Pn,δ). For z ∈ Ω(cid:48),

|Pn,δ(z)| = |z| · |Sn,δ(z)| ≥ inf{|z| : z ∈ Ω(cid:48)} · M > R.

n,δ(z)| = ∞. Hence Ω(cid:48) ⊂ ˆC \ K(Pn,δ).

Hence z ∈ Ω(cid:48) implies Pn,δ(z) ∈ Ω(cid:48). For z ∈ Ω(cid:48), we also have |Pn,δ(z)| > |z|M ,
with M > 1, so limk→∞ |P k

Proposition 3.2. Let E be a ﬁnite union of disjoint smooth Jordan domains
in C that contains 0 and let  > 0. Then there exists D > 0 such that for
any 0 < δ ≤ D there exists N (δ) ∈ N such that n ≥ N implies
d (E,K(Pn,δ)) < ,
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Fix  > 0. For each Jordan curve Γi of Γ = ∂E, pick
connected component of ˆC \ A, and let E(cid:48) = ˆC \ (Ω(cid:48) ∪ A). We may pick the
annuli Ai to be skinny enough that A ⊂ N(Γ) and for every y ∈ Γ, B(y)
has nonempty intersection with E(cid:48) and with Ω(cid:48). (This is possible because
Γ is compact.) We may further assume that the annuli are skinny enough
that 0 ∈ E(cid:48). Let P be one of the polynomials Pn,δ from the statement of
Proposition 3.1.

Suppose x ∈ K(P ); then x ∈ E or x ∈ A\E. If x ∈ A\E, then d(x, Γ) < 
since A ⊂ N(Γ), so d(x, E) < 2. Hence x ∈ N2(E). Now suppose x ∈ E;
then either x ∈ E(cid:48) or x ∈ A. If x ∈ A, then d(x,K(P )) ≤ d(x, E(cid:48)) < 2.
Hence x ∈ N2(K(P )). Thus d(E,K(P )) < 2. A similar argument shows
d(Ω, ˆC \ K(P )) < 2.
Now suppose x ∈ Γ. Then x ∈ A, and B(x) contains both a point
u ∈ Ω(cid:48) ⊂ ˆC \ K(P ) and a point v ∈ E(cid:48) ⊂ K(P ). The straight line path from
u to v is in B(x) and must contain a point of J (P ). Hence x ∈ N2(J (P )).
Now suppose x ∈ J (P ). Then x ∈ A, and A ⊂ N(Γ). Thus d(Γ,J (P )) <

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Without loss of generality, we assume ∂E consists of
smooth Jordan curves. If 0 ∈ E, we may take P to be any of the polynomials

Pn,δ associated to E in Proposition 3.2. If 0 (cid:54)∈ E, let (cid:101)E be a translated copy
translation of any of the polynomials Pn,δ associated to (cid:101)E in Proposition

of E that contains 0. We may then take P to be the conjugation by the
