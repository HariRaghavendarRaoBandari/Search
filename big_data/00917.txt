It is well-known that the swelling behavior of ionic nanogels depends on their cross-link density,
however it is unclear how diﬀerent topologies should aﬀect the response of the polyelectrolyte
network. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the equilibrium properties of ionic
nanogels as a function of salt concentration Cs and the fraction f of ionizable groups in a
polyelectrolyte network formed by cross-links of functionality z. Our results indicate that the
network with cross-links of low connectivity result in nanogel particles with higher swelling ratios.
We also conﬁrm a de-swelling eﬀect of salt on nanogel particles.

INTRODUCTION

Ionic microgel and nanogel particles formed by cross-
linked polyelectrolyte networks displays many remark-
able properties which make them suitable for applications
in drug-delivery systems, where molecules can be encap-
sulated and then released at speciﬁc targets1,2. This
is possible through a swelling (or de-swelling) process,
where solvent molecules ﬂow into (or leave) the cross-
linked network. Experimentally3,4 it is well-known that
the properties of ionic microgels and nanogels particles
can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the changes in tempera-
ture, solvent quality, salt concentration, ionic strength,
and degree of cross-linking. Although these eﬀects have
been extensively studied in ionic macrogels5–9, little is
known about ionic nanogels formed by ﬁnite-size cross-
linked polyelectrolyte networks10,11.

Theoretically, the swelling processes in polyelectrolyte
networks have been studied4,10,12 using Flory’s theory13,
which combines the mixing term, electrostatic, and elas-
tic contributions into the total free energy of the system.
An important aspect of the theory is the relationship
between the (eﬀective) number of chains of the net-
work Neﬀ and the elastic free energy14, i.e. ∆Felastic ∝
Neﬀ. Clearly, the unambiguous interpretation of this
relationship in terms of the network topology and its
validation is relevant to the development of predictive
theories, e.g.15,16.
In principle, such relationship can
be veriﬁed by computer simulations considering explicit
network structures, but to our knowledge current studies
have so far only exploited polyelectrolyte networks with
diamond-like structures (i.e. with tetrafunctional cross-
links)11,17–20.

Here we explore this issue by considering three types of
nanogel particles generated by polyelectrolyte networks
of diﬀerent topologies characterized by the functionality
(also known as coordination number or connectivity) z

∗ lerizzi@ufv.br
† levin@if.ufrgs.br

of the cross-links. In particular, we will investigate how
the equilibrium properties of the nanosized gel particles
are aﬀected by the fraction f of the ionizable groups
and salt concentration Cs in solution. These important
eﬀects have also been explored by experiments21–29 and
theory10,15,16,30–36.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the nanogel particle is mod-
eled as a polyelectrolyte network with Nmon monomers
inside a spherical Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell of volume V =
1/ρ, where ρ is the number density of nanogel particles
in solution. The radius of the WS cell is then R =
(3/4πρ)1/3. Some monomers of the network are ionizable
(anionic) and will dissociate releasing a counterion into
solution. The fraction of dissociation f determines the
number of negatively charged monomers Z = f Nmon in
the network, and charge neutrality requires Z counterions
in solution. The counterions are allowed to diﬀuse
everywhere inside the WS cell. For simplicity, we will
assume that all the ions are spherical while the solvent,
water, is modeled as a dielectric continuum.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of topology on the
swelling of the nanogel particle, we study three diﬀerent
networks that are arbitrarly generated from a regular
structures determined by the functionality z of the cross-
links. As illustrated in Fig. 1(b)-(d), the networks are
built considering cross-links with z = 4, 5, and 6, that
are connected to each other through chains with m
monomers. The ﬁnal networks are obtained by cropping
the large regular template structures (with the number
of monomers larger than Nmon), so that only the Nmon
monomers inside a spherical volume comprise the nanogel
particle.
Importantly, we have selected such spherical
volume in a way that all the diﬀerent networks are formed
by approximately the same number of monomers Nmon,
which leads to diﬀerent number of cross-links Nc with
functionality z, as shown in Table I. Note that this
procedure leads to networks with higher eﬀective cross-

length scales, respectively; and β = 1/kBT , where T is
the temperature and kB is the Boltzmann’s constant. In
addition, adjacent monomers in the network (which are
deﬁned a priori by construction) interact via a ﬁnitely
extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential38,39,

link line density ρc = Nc/Nmon as z is lowered. Also,
the cropping procedure inevitably results in Nd dangling
chains (which could have less than m monomers) near
the surface of the polyelectrolyte network, as illustrated
in Fig. 1(a).

Next we introduce the interaction potentials between
the components of the system. To describe a nanogel
particle immersed in an implicit athermal solvent, where
there is a slight preference of polyelectrolytes to be
surrounded by solvent molecules, our model assumes that
all monomers in the network interact via a non-bonded,
shifted and truncated repulsive Lennard-Jones potential,
the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen37 (WCA) potential
i.e.
commonly used in simulations of polyelectrolytes (see
e.g.38,39), which is given by

where λB is the Bjerrum length and αi = ±1 or 0,
depending of the charges of the interacting particles. We
also include a hard core (excluded volume) potential be-
tween all particles (i.e. monomer-monomer, ion-monomer
and ion-ion) which is +∞ if rij < dmin or 0, otherwise.
This potential precludes any two particles to be closer
than a distance dmin.

In order to obtain the equilibrium properties of
the system we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
with standard Metropolis acceptance criteria40, where
the transition probability is given by p({(cid:126)rij}old →
{(cid:126)rij}new) = min (1, exp−β[U ({(cid:126)rij}new) − U ({(cid:126)rij}old)]),
with βU ({(cid:126)rij}new) and βU ({(cid:126)rij}old) being the total
energetic contribution (i.e. WCA, FENE, electrostatic,
and hard core potentials) evaluated for the new and
old conﬁgurations of the system, respectively. New
conﬁgurations are proposed by attempting to move a
single particle and a MC step is deﬁned after all particles
in the system have attempted a move. Only diﬀusive-
like random movements are considered, which means
that a particle could move in any direction within a
maximum displacement with modulus dmax. The value
of dmax = 4 ˚A is considered here since it provided the
optimal choice from previous studies39.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS

Next we present results for a salt-free solution,
i.e. when Cs = 0 and the only dissociated ions in the
system are those from the polyelectrolyte network. For
all topologies consider, the networks are generated with
chains including m = 8 monomers between the cross-
links.
In all simulations the nanogel concentration is
set at ρ = 10−8 ˚A−3 (approximately 17 µM), and the
parameters of the potentials are given by ε = 0.8333,
σ = 2rNa+ = 4 ˚A, λB = 7.2, r0 = 4 ˚A, and dmin = 4 ˚A.
For each value of dissociation fraction f , the mean values
and error bars of the quantities presented below were
evaluated using conﬁgurations taken from 50 indepen-
dent simulations (diﬀerent seeds) with runs amounting

0.5 − 1.0 × 106 MC steps. To avoid correlations, we skip

a measurement for a given fraction f corresponds to at
least 2500 diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

(cid:11) /2, where

terms of the radius of gyration Rg = (cid:10)r2

First, we investigate the eﬀects of dissociation fraction
f on the size of a nanogel particle, which is deﬁned in
the average (cid:104)...(cid:105) is over all ij pairs in the polylectrolyte
network13. For instance, when the dissociation fraction
g = (67 ± 2) ˚A for
is zero, the radius of gyration gives R0
g = (56±2) ˚A for
g = (58±2) ˚A for z = 5, and R0
z = 4, R0
z = 6. We note that these values yields similar results
for the volume cross-link densities, θc = Nc/V 0
g with
V 0
g = 4π(R0
for all networks considered, which
contrasts with the line densities ρc presented in Table I.
Figure 2(a) shows that the relative nanogel radius
Rg/R0
g increases as the dissociation fraction f increases,
which is in agreement with what is theoretically predicted
in Refs.16,41. The increasing behavior of Rg is similar
for the diﬀerent networks, but one can observe that it
gets more pronounced for those with low connectivity.
Another useful measurement to quantify this eﬀect is
the swelling ratio3, which can be deﬁned as S = (Vs −
Vd)/Vd), where Vs and Vd are the volume of the nanogel in
two solvency conditions (e.g. the swelled and de-swelled
states, respectively). Hence for a given dissociation
fraction f the swelling ratio can be simply written as
S = (R3

radius for f = 0. As is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b),
the highest swelling ratios S are achieved by the networks
formed by cross-links of low connectivity (z = 4).

The dissociated counterions can diﬀuse around the
polyelectrolyte network, so that the nanogel particles
acquire an eﬀective net charge15–17,42,43, which is smaller
than the bare charge Z of the polyelectrolyte backbone.
The eﬀective charge is given by, Zeﬀ = Z − (N + − N−),
where N + and N− are the number of positive and
negative ions inside the nanogel volume, respectively.
Here we take N− = 0 because there are no negative
ions in the solution when salt concentration is zero
(Cs = 0). Figure 2(b) shows that Zeﬀ increases with
the dissociation fraction f , which is consistent with
the theoretical predictions of Ref.16. For larger values
of f the network with functionality z = 4 presents
slightly lower values of Zeﬀ in comparison to the other
networks. This occurs mainly because the network
with functionality z = 4 allows for more counterions to
become trapped between the polyelectrolytes chains, as
shown by the relative number of positive charges inside
a nanogel n+ = N +/Z (inset of Fig. 2(b)). These
results corroborate the equilibrium behaviour observed
in previous simulations11,17. However, in contrast to the
previous theoretical studies15,16 that predicted a scaling
Zeﬀ ∼ f 0.5, our results suggest a more linear behavior,
which might be related to the relatively small size of the
polyelectrolyte networks considered in our simulations.

To better characterize this picture we evaluate the
monomer ρm(r) and the ionic ρ±(r) density proﬁles.
Figure 3 shows ρm(r) and ρ+(r) for three diﬀerent
networks at diﬀerent values of dissociation fraction f .
As can be seen in the upper panels, the heterogeneity
due to the speciﬁc topology of the networks is reﬂected
in monomer density proﬁles and becomes evident as
the dissociation fraction f increases and the nanogel
swells.
Such heterogeneities in density proﬁles have
been observed in simulations and were related both to
solvent quality conditions19 and to monomer-ion steric
repulsion20. Interestingly, it has been speculated that the
void created at the center of the nanogel particle might
have potential to act as a drug carrier18, but our results
suggest that the density proﬁles are inherent to the
structure of the network considered, corroborating recent
experimental evidences44. For instance, the monomer
density proﬁle in Fig. 3(c) of the swelled network for
f = 0.5 displays a peak when r/Rg approaches the center
of the nanogel (r = 0). This happens because a cross-
link with functionality z = 6 is placed (by construction)
in the center of that network, which diﬀers from the
network with z = 5 in Fig. 3(b), where no cross-link
is placed at the center of the initially generated network.
Despite these heterogeneities in ρm(r), the ionic density
proﬁles for the three networks present similar behaviors,
i.e. showing higher values of ρ+(r) (both inside and
outside the nanogel particle) as the fraction f increases.
Now we turn our attention to the eﬀect of 1:1 salt
In this

on the swelling properties of nanogel particles.

predicted by the theory of Ref.16, and also observed in
experiments24,28,29,32,45,46and in a previous simulation
study11. We note that even though excluded volume
eﬀects are taken into account in our model, we are
not able to observe a reentrant (or re-swelling) behavior
expected for high salt concentrations35,47.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In summary, we presented an analysis of the swelling
behavior of ionic nanogels deﬁned by explicit polyelec-
trolyte networks formed by cross-links of diﬀerent topolo-
gies. Our results indicate that despite the higher eﬀective
cross-link line density ρc, the polyelectrolyte network
formed by cross-links with low connectivity (z = 4)
display the highest volume changes both in the presence
and in the absence of monovalent salt in the system. In
particular, we have veriﬁed that both nanogel size Rg and
its eﬀective net charge Zeﬀ increase as the fraction f of
ionizable groups in the network increases. Also, there is a
clear de-swelling behavior for a increasing concentration
of salt in solution for the networks with functionality
z = 4 at high values of f . We found that these eﬀects are
dramatically reduced for the networks with functionality
z = 6, indicating that a higher elastic energy contribution
is hampering the change in the size of the nanogel
particle, which is conﬁrmed in the Appendix section. By
considering that the eﬀective number of chains in the
network Neﬀ is proportional to the functionality z of its
cross-links, our results corroborates Flory’s assumption

case, additionally to the Z positively charged ions due to
dissociation of the ionizable groups of the polyelectrolyte
network, the dissociation of salt at a given concentration
Cs = Ns/V leads to Ns coions (anions) and Ns counteri-
ons (cations) in solution. For simplicity, such additional
ions are considered to be hard spheres which interact with
all charged particles in the system via Coulomb (Eq. 3)
and hard core potentials.

As shown in Fig. 4, the eﬀect of the presence of salt
on the de-swelling behavior of the network is weaker for
the networks with high connectivity. Particularly, for
the network with z = 4, one can see that while the
nanogel radius Rg remains constant for low values of the
dissociation fraction, it displays a decreasing behavior
for f = 0.5, which is in agreement with the behavior

that ∆Felastic ∝ Neﬀ, although in his theory the elastic
free energy has a purely entropic origin14.

Finally, we note that our results are in a qualitative
agreement with the swelling behavior theoretically pre-
dicted in Ref.16. A quantitative comparison with the
theory may be hampered by the assumptions of implicit
chain (modeled by an elastic energy contribution) and a
ﬂat monomer density inside the nanogel volume, as these
approximations might not be appropriate for small-sized
nanogel particles studied in the present simulations.

APPENDIX: ELASTIC ENERGY OF THE

POLYELECTROLYTE NETWORKS

Here we present an analysis of the elastic energy
obtained from simulations of a salt-free solution where
diﬀerent values of the dissociation fraction f yields
networks with diﬀerent sizes, which are described by
the ratio α = Rg/R0
g (see Fig. 2a). Estimates for the
changes in elastic energy are obtained as the diﬀerence

in the equilibrium values of the FENE potential (see
Eq. 2 for the pairwise deﬁnition) evaluated for the
whole network at two dissociation fraction conditions,
i.e. (cid:104)β∆UFENE(cid:105)(f ) = (cid:104)βUFENE(cid:105)(f ) − (cid:104)βUFENE(cid:105)(0). As
shown in Figure 5, the elastic energy contribution is
higher for the networks with high connectivity.
