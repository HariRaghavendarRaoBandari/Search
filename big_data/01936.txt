The structure of an interior dipole magnetic ﬁeld of neutron stars in f (R) gravity is considered.
For this purpose, the perturbative approaches are used when both the deviations from general
relativity and the deformations of spherically symmetric conﬁgurations associated with the presence
of the magnetic ﬁeld are assumed to be small. Solutions are constructed which describe relativistic,
spherically symmetric conﬁgurations consisting of a gravitating magnetized perfect ﬂuid modeled by
a realistic equation of state. Comparing conﬁgurations from general relativity and modiﬁed gravity,
we reveal possible diﬀerences in the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld which occur in considering
neutron stars in modiﬁed gravity.

INTRODUCTION

Neutron stars represent good objects for studying physical eﬀects of strong gravity and properties of matter under
extreme conditions which are far outside the realm of possible laboratory physics. The mean density of neutron stars
is of the order of nuclear density. Such matter cannot be obtained in a laboratory, and, therefore, it is possible to
describe it only by using some theoretical models. Their veriﬁcation is carried out by analyzing and interpreting the
results of astronomical observations with subsequent reﬁnement of original theoretical models [1].

Usually neutron stars are studied in Einstein’s general relativity (GR). However, taking into account the presence of
strong gravitational ﬁelds in such conﬁgurations, strong-ﬁeld eﬀects resulting from a consideration of modiﬁed gravity
theories (MGTs) extending GR may in general begin to manifest themselves. One of the simplest ways to modify
GR is to change the Einstein gravitational Lagrangian ∼ R by the modiﬁed Lagrangian ∼ f (R), where f (R) is some
function of the scalar curvature R. Such MGTs have initially been applied for the description of the evolution of the
very early Universe (see, e.g., the pioneering works [2]). However, after the discovery of the accelerated expansion of
the present Universe, MGTs have found some interesting applications in modeling this acceleration. In particular,
instead of introducing a special substance, called dark energy, as it is done in general relativity, in MGTs such an
acceleration can be provided without using any new fundamental ingredients (for a general review on the subject, see,
e.g., Ref. [3]).

At the present time MGTs are applied not only in describing the present acceleration of the Universe but also, for
example, in considering thick brane models [4] and in modeling the rotation curves of galaxies [5]. When scales of
objects under investigation decrease further, one may consider compact astrophysical conﬁgurations. In particular,
within the framework of f (R) gravity, this can be relativistic stars [6] or such exotic objects as wormholes [7]. However,
eﬀects of MGTs may also manifest themselves in considering less exotic objects like neutron stars [8–12]. Considering
such objects within the framework of diﬀerent types of f (R) gravities and using various equations of state for neutron
matter, one can reveal the allowed forms of f (R) satisfying the observational constraints.

Another important ingredient of neutron stars is a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The measured surface magnetic ﬁelds of
such objects are in the range of 1011 − 1013 G (for the so-called “classical pulsars”) and can reach values of the order
of 1015 G for magnetars. Stellar magnetic ﬁelds are currently under intensive investigation (see, e.g., the book [13] on
stellar magnetism in general and some works [14, 15] on particular questions of the structure of strongly magnetized
conﬁgurations, and also references therein). Such studies are usually performed within the framework of GR. In turn,
there are recent researches devoted to a consideration of the inﬂuence of superstrong magnetic ﬁelds (∼ 1017 − 1018G)
on the structure of neutron stars in MGTs [16, 17]. The presence of such strong ﬁelds results in modiﬁcations of an
equation of state of neutron star matter and in changes in mass-radius relations.

In modeling magnetized neutron stars in modiﬁed gravity in Refs. [16, 17], the approach is employed where the
distribution of a spherically symmetric magnetic ﬁeld is given by some function of baryon density. Here we want to

consider the case where a magnetic ﬁeld is modeled in the form of an axially symmetric dipole ﬁeld, whose distribution
is self-consistently determined from a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In doing so, we assume that the
energy density of the magnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the energy density of the neutron matter. This permits us to
make a perturbative expansion of the ﬁeld equations, where axisymmetric deformations of the conﬁguration associated
with the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld are regarded as second-order perturbations to a background spherically
symmetric conﬁguration [18].

In turn, background spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions will be sought within the framework of the per-
turbative approach to f (R) gravity from Ref. [8]. Then the resulting ﬁeld equations are second-order diﬀerential
equations with respect to metric functions, instead of fourth-order equations obtained in f (R) gravity in general.

Working within the framework of the above perturbative approaches, our goal will be to clarify the inﬂuence which

the eﬀects of modiﬁed gravity have on the structure of the interior dipole magnetic ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we present the statement of the problem and derive the corresponding
equations in the MGT for the systems under consideration. In Sec. III we numerically solve these equations for two
special choices of the function f (R), for which we obtain distributions of the magnetic ﬁeld in GR and in the MGT.
Comparing the results, we demonstrate the inﬂuence which the eﬀects of modiﬁed gravity have on the structure and
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Finally, in Sec. IV we summarize the results obtained.

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND EQUATIONS

The purpose of the paper is to study the structure of the interior magnetic ﬁeld of neutron stars in f (R) gravity.

In doing so, we make use of the following simplifying assumptions [18]:

• We do not take into account rotational deformations and consider only static equilibrium magnetized conﬁgu-

rations consisting of neutron matter modeled by some realistic equation of state (EoS).

• The magnetic ﬁeld is modeled in the form of an axisymmetric, poloidal magnetic ﬁeld produced by toroidal
electric currents. The presence of such a ﬁeld results in a deviation of the shape of the conﬁguration from
spherical symmetry.
• We consider the case where the magnetic ﬁeld strength is of the order of 1012−1015 G. In this case deviations from
the spherical shape are negligible, since the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than the gravitational
energy [19]. This permits us to neglect in the zeroth approximation the deformations of the conﬁguration
associated with the magnetic ﬁeld and to consider such deformations as a second-order eﬀect [see Eq. (16)
below].

• The interior of a star is assumed to be a perfectly conducting medium free of electric charges and ﬁelds.
Taking all this into account, in Sec. II A we write down the background equations for a spherically symmetric case,

and in Sec. II B we derive equations for the magnetic ﬁeld.

A. Background equations

Here we consider modiﬁed gravity with the action [the metric signature is (+,−,−,−)]

S = −

c4

16πG Z d4x√−gf (R) + Sm,

(1)

where f (R) is an arbitrary nonlinear function of R and Sm denotes the action of matter. Such a modiﬁcation of
Einstein’s GR gives new possibilities both in considering cosmological problems and in studying compact objects (see
the Introduction). However, when one varies this action, the resulting equations are in general fourth-order diﬀerential
equations for metric functions, whose study encounters the known diﬃculties (see, e.g., Refs. [8, 20]).

An alternative way is to introduce corrections to general relativity perturbatively, as suggested in Ref. [8]. Instead
of considering an exact theory in which the presence of higher-order derivatives assumes the occurrence of new degrees
of freedom, in this approach deviations from GR are assumed to be small. Such an approach removes the extra degrees
of freedom and strongly simpliﬁes the theory.

Technically this approach assumes that deviations from GR can be parameterized by a single parameter α. In this

case the gravitational Lagrangian density in (1) is chosen in the form
f = R + αh(R) + O(α2),

(2)

where h(R) is an arbitrary function of R and O(α2) denotes the possible higher-order corrections in α. In turn, metric
functions can be expanded in α as

3

where the superscript (0) means that the metric function is obtained in Einstein gravity, i.e., by solving second-order
diﬀerential equations. Then modiﬁed gravitational equations are obtained by varying the action (1) with (2) with
respect to the metric in the form

i R is the Einstein tensor, hR ≡ dh/dR, and ; denotes the covariant derivative.
As a matter source in these equations, we take a perfect ﬂuid with the energy-momentum tensor

where ε and p are the ﬂuid energy density and pressure, respectively.

(3)

(4)

To derive the modiﬁed Einstein equations and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ equation for the ﬂuid, we choose

the spherically symmetric line element in the form

where ν and λ are functions of the radial coordinate r only, and x0 = c t is the time coordinate.

ds2 = eν(dx0)2 − eλdr2 − r2(cid:0)dΘ2 + sin2 Θ dφ2(cid:1) ,

(5)

Following Refs. [8, 9], let us look for perturbed solutions of the ﬁeld equations by expanding the required functions

in α as follows:

ν = ν(0) + αν(1) + . . . ,

λ = λ(0) + αλ(1) + . . . ,

ε = ε(0) + αε(1) + . . . ,

p = p(0) + αp(1) + . . . ,

where the subscript (0) again means that the functions are obtained from a solution of the Einstein equations.

Using this perturbative approach, one can derive the following (t

that the external spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild solution, one can introduce a new function M (r), deﬁned
as

Then the surface value of M can be regarded as a gravitational mass of the conﬁguration. Let us expand, as before,
M in α as M = M(0) + αM(1), where

Altogether then, for obtaining background solutions in the MGT we will use Eqs. (7), (9), and (10) for three
unknown functions ν, λ, p. Note that in Eq. (7), as well as in Eq. (9), the terms with α are calculated by using
solutions of the Einstein equations.

Since the perturbative terms of Eqs. (7) and (9) contain the function of the scalar curvature h(R), it is convenient

to rewrite R through the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T ,

R(0) = −

This expression contains the pressure and the energy density determined from a solution of Eq. (10) in GR using the
corresponding EoS (see below).

B. Magnetic ﬁeld equations

Consistent with the statement of the problem given at the beginning of Sec. II, static spherically symmetric con-
ﬁgurations described in Sec. II A will be used as a background for the magnetic ﬁeld, which is assumed to be created
by a 4-current jµ = (0, 0, 0, jφ) [18]. For such a current, the electromagnetic 4-potential Aµ has only a φ-component
Aµ = (0, 0, 0, Aφ). In this case, taking into account the nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor
Frφ = ∂Aφ/∂r and FΘφ = ∂Aφ/∂Θ, the Maxwell equations, written in the metric (5), give the following elliptic
equation:

(15)

Solution of this equation is sought for a given current jl, an equation for which will be obtained below. Since here we
consider only a dipole magnetic ﬁeld for which l = 1, for convenience, we drop the subscript 1 on a and j hereafter.
For the magnetic ﬁeld under consideration, the current j is not arbitrary but has to satisfy an integrability con-
dition [14, 18]. To obtain this condition, we take into account the fact that the magnetic ﬁeld induces only small
deviations in the shape of the background spherically symmetric conﬁguration. To describe these deviations, we follow
the approach adopted in Ref. [18] and expand the metric in multipoles around the spherically symmetric spacetime.
Then one can regard the deformations of the metric and of the ﬂuid as second-order perturbations, whereas the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld potential and the current will be regarded as ﬁrst-order perturbations. In this case the corresponding
metric can be chosen in the form

ds2 = eν(r) {1 + 2 [h0(r) + h2(r)P2(cos Θ)]} (dx0)2 − eλ(r)(cid:26)1 +

where h0, h2, m0, m2, and k2 are the second-order corrections of the metric associated with the presence of the
magnetic ﬁeld, and P2 denotes the Legendre polynomial of order 2.

where the background solutions ε0, p0 and the perturbations δp0, δp2 depend on r only. Substituting these expansions
into the conservation law, T k
i;k = 0, and using the metric (16) and the background equation (10), we obtain the
following i = r and i = Θ components (cf. Ref. [18]):

where cj is an integration constant. Thus the equation for the magnetic ﬁeld (15) contains the current determined by
the expression (23).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we numerically integrate the obtained equations for two special choices of the function h(R). In
doing so, one needs some EoS for the neutron matter. This can be any of EoSs used in the literature in describing
matter at high densities and pressures (see, for example, Ref. [1]). Here we use the well-known SLy EoS, which can
be represented by the following analytical approximation [22]:

a1 + a2ξ + a3ξ3

ζ =

1 + a4ξ

f (a5(ξ − a6)) + (a7 + a8ξ)f (a9(a10 − ξ))
+(a11 + a12ξ)f (a13(a14 − ξ)) + (a15 + a16ξ)f (a17(a18 − ξ))

(24)

with ζ = log(p/dyn cm−2), ξ = log(ρ/g cm−3) , where ρ is the neutron matter density and f (x) = [exp(x) + 1]−1. The
values of the coeﬃcients ai can be found in Ref. [22].

To model deviations from Einstein gravity, the literature in the ﬁeld oﬀers a number of functions h(R) which are
applied to modeling neutron stars and give a realistic description of mass-radius relations for such type of compact
objects. Examples of h(R) can be found, for instance, in Refs. [9, 11, 12]. For our purpose, we employ two simple
expressions [12]:

• A power law, when the gravitational Lagrangian (2) is chosen in the form
f = R + αh(R) ≡ R + αR2 (1 + γR) .

(25)

The values of the free parameters γ and α appearing here should be constrained from observations. In the case
of pure R-squared gravity (i.e., when γ = 0) there are the following constraints on α: (i) in the weak-ﬁeld limit,
it is constrained by binary pulsar data as α . 5 × 1015cm2 [23]; (ii) in the strong gravity regime, the constraint
is α . 1010cm2 [9]. Since here, following Ref. [12], we consider the case where |γR| ∼ O(1), the constraints on
α can already diﬀer from the case of pure R-squared gravity. In this connection, the values of the parameters
α and γ will be chosen so as to satisfy the observations for the mass-radius relation given in Ref. [24]. Notice
that since here we employ the metric signature distinct from that of Ref. [12], below we take α, γ with opposite
signs compared with [12].
• An exponential law, when

where Rch is some characteristic value of the curvature. Here instead of α we use the dimensionless parameter
β to distinguish this case from that of given by Eq. (25).

f = R + βh(R) ≡ R + βR [exp (−R/Rch) − 1] ,

b = 8πGL2/c4. In the same way, one can derive dimensionless equations for h(R) from Eq. (26) (we do not show
them here to avoid overburdening the text).

These equations are to be solved subject to the boundary conditions given in the neighborhood of the center by

the following expansions:

(31)

where the expansion coeﬃcients are determined from Eqs. (28)-(30).

The step-by-step procedure for ﬁnding solutions is as follows. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd unperturbed solutions to
Eqs. (28)-(30), i.e., to consider the case where ¯α is set equal to zero. These solutions correspond to solutions of GR,
and we denote them by the subscript (0), i.e., ξ(0), ν(0), and v(0). Using these solutions, the dimensionless scalar
curvature from (11) is evaluated as

Σ(0) = −b(cid:0)c210ξ(0) − 3 · 10ζ(0)(cid:1) .

In the second step, the obtained solutions are used in the square brackets [. . .](0) in Eqs. (29) and (30), that permits
us to get solutions of the perturbed equations in the MGT. Let us denote these solutions by the subscript 0, i.e.,
ξ0, ν0, and v0, with a view to applying them as background solutions in calculating the magnetic ﬁeld by using the
equations from Sec. II B.

Note that in making the computations the integration is performed from the center to the point xb, where the
neutron matter density decreases to the value ρb ≈ 106g cm−3. We take this point to be a boundary of the star [10].
This density corresponds to the outer boundary of a neutron star crust up to which the SLy EoS (24) remains
valid [22].

Finally, in the third step, the obtained background solutions are used for calculating the distribution of the magnetic
ﬁeld along the radius of the conﬁguration. To do this, rewrite Eqs. (15) and (23) in terms of the above dimensionless
variables:

B. Structure of the magnetic ﬁeld

The structure of the magnetic ﬁeld is calculated for a set of conﬁgurations in the MGT with the functions (25)
and (26). As pointed out in Ref. [12], for models with these functions, there are two branches of stable solutions, i.e.,
solutions for which dM/dρc > 0, where ρc is the central density of neutron matter. One branch lies approximately
in the same range of ρc where the solutions of GR are located. However, in contrast to GR, there exists another
branch of stable solutions which lies at greater central densities. Our purpose here is to compare magnetic ﬁelds of
conﬁgurations which lie on both these stable branches.

The comparison is performed as follows:

• We consider pairs of conﬁgurations, each of which contains systems constructed in GR and in the MGT. The

conﬁgurations lie on two diﬀerent stable branches, have diﬀerent radii but the same masses.

• The free parameters of the magnetic ﬁeld ac, ¯cj are chosen in such a way as to provide the required surface
magnetic ﬁeld Bs (say, at the pole) for all conﬁgurations, and also to obtain asymptotically vanishing solutions
for the electromagnetic potential.

For this purpose, we constructed mass-radius relations for neutron stars in GR and in the MGT shown in Fig. 1.
Here the dotted contour depicts the region of observational constraints obtained for three neutron stars [24]. Taking
into account these constraints, we chose the pairs of conﬁgurations (shown by the bold dots in Fig. 1) so that they
were located either in the mentioned region or very close to it.

Notice that a necessary condition for the validity of the perturbative approach used here is that the maximum
value of the quantity ∆ = |αh(R)/R| would be always ∆max . 0.1 along the radius. For the conﬁgurations under
consideration, this condition is slightly violated only in the case of the model (25) with α = −30, γ = 10, when for
the conﬁguration with M = 1.70M⊙ we have ∆max ≈ 0.19 at the center. In all the remaining cases considered here
the condition for the perturbative approach to be valid is satisﬁed with suﬃcient accuracy.
Using the expressions (34), we calculated the components of the magnetic ﬁeld for the conﬁgurations of Fig. 1,
which are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. For purposes of comparison, the graphs are plotted using relative units where the
current radius x is normalized to the radius of the ﬂuid xb, and the magnetic ﬁeld is measured in units of the surface
strength Bs at the pole.

It is seen that the magnitude and the distribution of the interior magnetic ﬁeld change substantially depending
on the speciﬁc choice of h(R) and on the values of the free parameters here used.
In particular, for the case of
h(R) from (25) shown in Fig. 2 the component Bˆr may either be always greater than that of the GR case or have a
mixed behavior when it is less in the central region and then becomes greater than that of the GR case. In turn, the
behavior of the component B ˆΘ also depends appreciably on the chosen values of the parameters of the systems under
consideration. It is also interesting to note that for the neutron stars in the MGT there is a new type of behavior of
the component Bˆr, which may already have a maximum not at the center (as it is for the neutron stars in GR) but
somewhere in the intermediate region between the center and the edge of a star.

Note that Eqs. (15) and (22) are invariant under the transformation a, j → κa, κj, κ being any constant. Corre-
spondingly, the components of the magnetic ﬁeld given by Eq. (34) transform as Bˆr, B ˆΘ → κBˆr, κB ˆΘ. Then, if one
simultaneously replaces Bs by κBs, the graphs shown in Figs. 2 and 3 remain unchanged for any value of the ﬁeld, and
the dimensional values (in gauss) of the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld are obtained on multiplying these graphs by the
required surface value Bs. Of course, this holds true only within the perturbative approximation used here when one

FIG. 1: The mass-radius relations for neutron stars in GR (denoted as NSGR) and in the f (R) models (25) and (26) obtained
for the SLy EoS (24). Here and in Fig. 2 the values of the parameter α are given in units of 109cm2 and of γ – in units of
(rg⊙/2)2 [12], where rg⊙ is the gravitational radius of the Sun. The dotted contour depicts the region of the observational
constraints [24]. The bold dots show the pairs of conﬁgurations with the same masses equal to: for 1 – 1.24M⊙, for 2 – 1.41M⊙,
for 3 – 1.50M⊙, for 4 – 1.65M⊙, for 5 – 1.70M⊙, for 6 – 1.80M⊙.

can neglect the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the background conﬁgurations. In particular, the obtained graphs
can be applied both to the “classical pulsars” (for which Bs ∼ 1012 G) and to magnetars (for which Bs ∼ 1015 G).

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied equilibrium, gravitating conﬁgurations within the framework of f (R) gravity consisting of a
strongly magnetized neutron ﬂuid. In doing so, two simplifying approaches have been used: (i) The energy density
of the magnetic ﬁeld (modeled here in the form of a dipole ﬁeld) was assumed to be much smaller than the energy
density of the neutron matter. The axisymmetric deformations of a star associated with the dipole ﬁeld are small
that allows one to consider them as second-order corrections to the background conﬁgurations and to employ the
perturbative approach of Ref. [18] in describing such systems. (ii) As the background conﬁgurations, neutron stars
modeled in perturbative f (R) gravity have been used. As shown in Ref. [12], such conﬁgurations, in contrast to GR,
may possess not just one but two branches of stable solutions, and for the SLy EoS the new branch can describe the
observational data even better than this is done in GR.

Working within the framework of these perturbative approaches, our goal was to clarify the question of how the
presence of higher-order corrections to Einstein’s GR may inﬂuence the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld. For this
purpose, we compared conﬁgurations with equal masses from GR and from the MGT lying on diﬀerent branches of
stability. The main results of the studies can be summarized as follows:

(i) Neutron stars have been modeled using the SLy EoS (24) and two types of the function f (R):

in the form
of a power law (25) and in the exponential form (26). For these models, the mass-radius relations have been
constructed (see Fig. 1), using which we have chosen the pairs of conﬁgurations (each of which contains systems
from GR and from the MGT) satisfying the current observational constraints.

(ii) For these pairs, it was shown that the distribution of the interior magnetic ﬁeld depends substantially on the
speciﬁc choice of h(R) and on the values of the free parameters here used (see Figs. 2 and 3). At the same time,
from the point of view of a distant observer, conﬁgurations which enter in each of the pairs possess the same
masses and surface strengths of the magnetic ﬁeld, and also have similar distributions of the external magnetic
ﬁeld.

FIG. 2: The tetrad components Bˆr and B ˆΘ of the magnetic ﬁeld (in units of the surface strength of the magnetic ﬁeld Bs at
the pole) in the f (R) model (25) evaluated on the symmetry axis (Θ = 0) and in the equatorial plane (Θ = π/2), respectively,
are shown as functions of the relative radius x/xb. The curves are plotted for the conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 1 by the bold
dots. The thin vertical lines correspond to the boundary of the ﬂuid.

FIG. 3: The same as in Fig. 2 for the model (26). The constant Rch = −0.5 (rg⊙/2)−2 [12].

(iii) As was shown earlier in modeling neutron stars in f (R) gravity (see, e.g., Refs. [10, 11]), the deviations from
GR manifest themselves mainly near the surface of a star. This can aﬀect, in particular, the redshift of spectral
lines of the star’s atmosphere [11]. On the other hand, we have shown here that the magnetic ﬁeld, on the
contrary, diﬀers appreciably from GR mainly in the internal regions of a star, whereas its behavior near the
surface is practically the same as that of stars from GR.

Thus it is seen that the structure of the interior magnetic ﬁeld may depend substantially not only on the physical
properties of neutron matter (given by diﬀerent choices of EoSs, as demonstrated, for instance, in Refs. [14, 25]) and on
the form of internal electric currents but also on which type of gravitational theory is used in modeling neutron stars.
Note also that these diﬀerences already manifest themselves within the framework of the perturbative approaches
used here in describing the modiﬁed gravity and magnetic ﬁelds. Beyond the framework of these approaches, one may
expect the appearance of new changes in the structure of magnetic ﬁelds associated with the inﬂuence of modiﬁcations
of Einstein’s GR. This is a possible subject for further investigation.
