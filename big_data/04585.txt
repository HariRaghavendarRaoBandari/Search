Abstract

The form factors of the semileptonic χb2(1P ) → Bc¯lν decay are calculated using
the QCD sum rule approach. The results obtained are then used to estimate the decay
widths of this transition in all lepton channels. The orders of decay rates indicate
that this transition is accessible at LHC for all lepton channels.

Introduction

Quarkonia are ﬂavorless bound states composed of combinations of quarks and their an-
tiquarks. Since discovery of J/ψ meson in 1974, many new quarkonia states have been
detected. The quarkonia systems consist of charmonium and bottomonium. Due to the
large mass there are no toponium bound states and no light quark-antiquark states because
of the mixture of the light quarks in experiments. The large mass diﬀerence between charm
and bottom quarks prevents them from mixing. The heavy quark bound states may pro-
vide key tools for understanding the interactions between quarks, new hadronic production
mechanisms and transitions, the magnitude of the CKM matrix elements and also analyzing
the results of heavy-ion experiments.

The J/Ψ suppression in ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions was ﬁrst suggested as a
signal of the formation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, most recently, attentions
have shifted to the bottomonium states due to that they are more massive than charmonium
states. The bottom quarks and anti-quarks are relatively rare within the plasma, so the
probability for reproduction of the bottomonium states through recombination is much
smaller than for charm quarks. Consequently, it is expected that the bottomonium system
to be a cleaner probe of the QGP than the charmonium system. Hence investigations on
the properties of bottomonium systems can help us get useful information not only about
the nature of the b¯b systems, but also on the existence of QGP.

Since the discovery of quarkonium states, QCD sum rule technique as one of the most
powerful nonperturbative tools to hadron physics [1, 2] has played an important role in
understanding the quarkonia spectrum. In order to ﬁnd missing states one should know
their physical properties to develop a successful search strategy. Clearly signiﬁcant progress
in understanding of quarkonium production cannot be reached without detailed measure-
ments of the cross sections and fractions of the quarkonia. Thereby, form factors and decay
widths of quarkonia become signiﬁcant for completing quarkonia spectrum. Completing
the bottomonium spectrum is a crucial validation of theoretical calculations and a test of
our understanding of bottomonium states in the context of the quark model. Bottomo-
nium states are considered as great laboratories to search for the properties od QCD at low
energies.

In this connection, we investigate the decay properties of tensor χb2(1P ) meson as one
of the important members of the bottomonia to the heavy Bc meson in the present work.
The Bc meson with J P = 0− is the only meson consists of two heavy quarks with diﬀerent
ﬂavors. Yet, other possible Bc states (the scalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor) have not
been observed, however many new Bc species are expected to be produced at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) in the near future.

Taking into account the two-gluon condensate corrections, the transition form factors
¯lν decay channel are calculated within the three-point
of the semileptonic χb2(1P ) → Bc
QCD sum rule. We use the values of transition form factors to estimate the decay rate
of the transition under consideration at all lepton channels. The interpolating current of
χb2(1P ) with quantum numbers I G(J P C) = 0+(2++) contains derivatives with respect to
space-time. So, we start our calculations in the coordinate space then we apply the Fourier
transformation to go to the momentum space. To suppress the contributions of the higher
states and continuum, we apply a double Borel transformation.

The article is organized as follows. We derive the QCD sum rules for the transition form
factors in Section II. Last section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the obtained sum
rules, estimation of the decay rates at all lepton channels and concluding remarks.

eﬀective Hamiltonian can be written as

¯lν decay is based on b → c¯lν transition at quark level whose

where GF is the Fermi weak coupling constant and Vcb is element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-
Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix. After sandwiching the eﬀective Hamiltonian between the
initial and ﬁnal states, the amplitude of this transition is obtained in terms of transition
matrix elements. These matrix elements will be parameterized in terms of transition form
factors later.

In order to start our calculations, we consider the three-point correlation function

it in terms of QCD degrees of freedom like quark masses as well as quark and gluon con-
densates via operator product expansion (OPE). The QCD sum rules for form factors are
obtained by equating the above representations to each other. After applying a double
Borel transformation, the contributions of the higher states and continuum are suppressed.
The hadronic side of the correlation function is obtained by inserting complete sets of

intermediate states into Eq.(2). After performing the four-integrals over x and y, we get

3 Numerical results

To numerically analyze the sum rules obtained for the form factors, we use the meson masses
from PDG [4]. Considering the fact that the results of sum rules considerably depend on the
quark masses, decay constants and gluon condensate, we use the values of these parameters
from diﬀerent sources. For the quark masses we take into account all the pole values and
those obtained at MS scheme from the Refs.
[5–15]. For fBc, we consider all the values
predicted using diﬀerent methods in Refs.
[16–19]. In the case of fχb2, we use the only
value exists in the litreature, i.e. fχb2 = (0.0122 ± 0.0072) [20]. For the gluon condensate,
we also use its value from diﬀerent sources [1, 21–28] calculated via diﬀerent approaches.
From the sum rules for the form factors it is also clear that they contain extra four
auxiliary parameters, namely the Borel parameters M 2 and M ′2 as well as continuum
thresholds s0 and s′
0. The general criteria is that the physical quantities like form factors
should be independent of these parameters. Therefore, we need to determine their working
regions such that the form factors weakly depend on these parameters. To ﬁnd the Borel
windows, we require that the higher states and continuum contributions are suﬃciently
suppressed and the perturbative parts exceed the nonperturbative contributions and the
series of OPE converge. As a result we get the windows: 14 GeV 2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 20 GeV 2 and
8 GeV 2 ≤ M ′2 ≤ 12 GeV 2. The continuum threshold s0 and s′
0 are not completely arbitrary
but they are related to the energy of the ﬁrst excited states with the same quantum numbers
as the interpolating currents of the initial and ﬁnal channels. In this work the continuum
thresholds are chosen in the intervals 104 GeV 2 ≤ s0 ≤ 108 GeV 2 and 43 GeV 2 ≤ s′
0 ≤
45 GeV 2.
The dependence of form factors K and b+, as examples, on Borel parameters M 2 and
M ′2 at q2 = 0 are plotted in ﬁgures 1 and 2. From these ﬁgures we see that form factors
show overall weak dependence on the Borel mass parameters. The behaviors of the form
factors K, b+, b− and h in terms of q2 are shown in ﬁgures (3-6). In these ﬁgures, the red
triangles show the QCD sum rule predictions, yellow-solid line denotes the prediction of
ﬁt function obtained using the central values of the input parameters and the green band
shows the uncertainty due to errors of input parameters. Note that to obtain the central
values, we consider the average values of input parameters discussed above, however, to
calculate the uncertainties we consider all errors of these parameters from diﬀerent sources
previously quoted. As it is seen from these ﬁgures the sum rules results are truncated at
some points. Hence, to enlarge the region to whole physical region we need to ﬁnd some
ﬁt functions such that their results coincide well with the QCD sum rules predictions at
reliable regions. For this reason we show the q2 dependence of form factors including both

line denotes the prediction of ﬁt function obtained using the central values of the input
parameters and the green band shows the uncertainty due to errors of input parameters.

In summary, we have calculated the transition form factors for the semileptonic χb2 →
Bc¯lν transition using QCD sum rule technique. We took into account the two-gluon con-
densate contributions as nonperturbative eﬀects. We used these form factors to estimate
the order of decay widths at all lepton channels. The order of decay width reveal that these
transitions can be seen at LHC in near future. Any comparison of the experimental results
with our predictions can provide us with essential knowledge on the nature of the tensor
χb2(1P ) state.
