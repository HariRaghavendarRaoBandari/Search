Abstract.

Multiplicity distributions of charged particles and their event-by-event ﬂuctuations
have been compiled for relativistic heavy-ion collisions from the available experimental
data at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN and also by the use of an event
generator. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations are sensitive to QCD phase transition and to
the presence of critical point in the QCD phase diagram.
In addition, multiplicity
ﬂuctuations provide baselines for other event-by-event measurements. Multiplicity
ﬂuctuation expressed in terms of the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is
an intensive quantity, but is sensitive to the volume ﬂuctuation of the system. The
importance of the choice of narrow centrality bins and the corrections of centrality bin
width eﬀect for controlling volume ﬂuctuations have been discussed.
It is observed
that the mean and width of the multiplicity distributions monotonically increase as
a function of increasing centrality at all collision energies, whereas the multiplicity
ﬂuctuations show minimal variations with centrality. The beam energy dependence
shows that the multiplicity ﬂuctuations have a slow rise at lower collision energies and
remain constant at higher energies.

1. Introduction

One of the basic advantages of the heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies is the
production of large number of particles in each event, which facilitates the event-by-
event study of several observables. The major physics goals at these high energies is to
understand the nature of phase transition from normal hadronic matter to a phase of
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This topic has been of tremendous interest over last four
decades, both in terms of theoretical studies and large scale experiments. Dedicated
experiments have been performed at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the
Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to
search as well as study the QGP phase. It is also of immense importance to explore the
QCD phase transition. The ﬂuctuations of experimentally accessible quantities, such

Fluctuations in Charged Particle Multiplicities in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions

as particle multiplicity, mean transverse momentum, temperature, particle ratios, and
other global observables are related to the thermodynamic properties of the system, such
as the entropy, speciﬁc heat, chemical potential and matter compressibility [1, 2, 3, 4].
Fluctuations of these quantities on an event-by-event basis have been used as basic tools
for understanding the particle production mechanisms, the nature of the phase transition
and critical ﬂuctuations at the QCD phase boundary. A non-monotonic behaviour of
the ﬂuctuations as a function of collision centrality and energy may signal the onset of
deconﬁnement, and can be eﬀectively used to probe the critical point in the QCD phase
diagram.

Theoretical models, based on lattice QCD, reveal that at vanishing baryon chemical
potential (µB), the transition from QGP to hadron gas is a simple crossover, whereas
at large µB, the phase transition is of ﬁrst order [5]. Experimental observables at
SPS and RHIC energies indeed point to the onset of deconﬁnement and a ﬁrst order
phase transition [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. First order phase transitions can lead to large density
ﬂuctuations resulting in bubble or droplet formation and hot spots [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
which gives rise to large multiplicity ﬂuctuations in a given rapidity interval. The local
multiplicity ﬂuctuations have been predicted as a signature of critical hadronization at
RHIC and LHC energies [15]. Measurements at the vanishing µB at LHC energies will
be important as one can accurately calculate several quantities and their ﬂuctuations.
Multiplicity of produced particles is an important quantity which characterizes
the system produced in heavy-ion collisions. Consequently, multiplicity and its
ﬂuctuation has an eﬀect on all other measurements. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations have been
characterized by the scaled variances of the multiplicity distributions, deﬁned as,

ω =

σ2
µ

,

(1)

where µ and σ2 are the mean and variance of the multiplicity distribution, respectively.
Multiplicity ﬂuctuations have been reported by E802 experiment [16] at AGS,
WA98 [17], NA49 [18, 19], NA61 [20, 21] and CERES [22] experiments at SPS, and
the PHENIX experiment [23] at RHIC. The nature of the multiplicity distributions
as a function of centrality and beam energy have been compared to statistical
and available model calculations. These results have generated a great deal of
interests [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations have contributions from statistical
(random) components as well as those which have dynamical (deterministic) origin.
The statistical components of the multiplicity ﬂuctuations have direct impact on the
ﬂuctuations in other measured quantities. The statistical components have contributions
from the choice of centrality, ﬂuctuation in impact parameter or number of participants,
ﬁnite particle multiplicity, eﬀect of limited acceptance of the detectors, ﬂuctuations in
the number of primary collisions, eﬀect of rescattering, etc. [2, 14]. In order to extract
the dynamical part of the ﬂuctuations, the contribution to multiplicity from statistical
part has to be well understood.

In this article, we present a study of charged particle multiplicity ﬂuctuations as a
function of centrality and beam-energy for Au+Au collisions for the Beam Energy Scan

(BES) energies at RHIC (from √sNN = 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV) and Pb+Pb collisions at
LHC-energy (√sNN = 2.76 TeV) from the available experimental data as well as using
diﬀerent modes of the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) model [28]. In the next section,
we present diﬀerent model settings of AMPT. In section III, we discuss the method
of centrality selection for ﬂuctuation studies and the centrality bin width corrections.
Multiplicity distributions for all the collision energies are presented in section IV. The
results of multiplicity ﬂuctuations are given in section V. A discussion of the results is
presented in section VI and the paper is summarized in section VII.

2. AMPT Model

[28, 29, 30]

The AMPT model
is used as a guidance for obtaining multiplicity
distributions and ﬂuctuations wherever the experimental data are not available. The
model consists of four main components: the initial conditions, partonic interactions,
the conversion from the partonic to the hadronic matter, and hadronic interactions. The
model provides two modes: Default and String Melting (SM). In both the cases, the
initial conditions are taken from HIJING [31] with two Wood-Saxon type radial density
proﬁle of the colliding nuclei. The multiple scattering among the nucleons of two heavy
ion nuclei are governed by the eikonal formalism. In the default mode, energetic partons
recombine and the string fragmentation takes place via the Lund string fragmentation
function, given by,

f (z) ∝ z−1(1 − z)aexp(−bm2

T /z),

(2)

where a and b are fragmentation parameters taken as 2.2 and 0.5, respectively,
corresponding to total parton elastic cross section of 10 mb. Interactions of the produced
hadrons are described by A Relativistic Transport model (ART).

In the SM mode, the strings produced from HIJING are decomposed into partons
which are fed into the parton cascade along with the minijet partons. The partonic
matter coalescence to produce hadrons, and the hadronic interactions are subsequently
modeled using ART. While the Default mode describes the collision evolution in terms
of strings and minijets followed by string fragmentation, the SM mode includes a fully
partonic QGP phase that hadronizes through quark coalescence.

For both the modes, Boltzmann equations are solved using Zhang’s parton cascade

(ZPC) with total parton elastic scattering cross section,

σgg =

9πα2
s
2µ2

1 + µ2/s ≈

(3)

where αs is the strong coupling constant, s and t are the Mandelstam variables and µ
is the Debye screening mass. Here αs and µ are the key deciding factors for multiplicity
yield at particular beam energy, and are taken as 0.47 and 1.8, corresponding to
σgg=10mb. The values of a, b, αs, and µ are also tuned, and are found to be 1.5 mb, 3
mb, 6 mb and 10 mb, respectively. The mean values of multiplicities are found to match
to the experimental data with these tunings. The AMPT model, therefore, provides a
convenient way to investigate a variety of observables with the default and SM modes.

3. Centrality selection and centrality bin width correction

The particle production mechanisms are expected to be dependent on the collision
energy as well as the centrality of the collision. For most of the analysis, it is important
to consider proper centrality window so that ﬂuctuations because of the selection are
minimized. Centrality of a collision is characterised by the impact parameter (b) of
the collision or equivalently the average number of participating nucleons (hNparti ).
In an experimental scenario it is not possible to access these two quantities, so charged
particle multiplicities within a given rapidity range or energy depositions by calorimeters
are used. In a model dependent way, the connections of these experimental quantities
to b or hNparti are made. This is indeed needed in order to connect any measured
quantity with theoretical calculations and to compare them with measurements from
other experiments.

In the present study, centrality is selected using the minimum bias distribution of
charged particles in the forward pseudorapidity (η) range of 2.0 < |η| < 3.0, and the
multiplicity ﬂuctuations are calculated in the central η-range (|η| < 0.5). Thus the two
η-ranges are very distinct and the ﬂuctuation results are unbiased. As an example of
centrality selection procedure, in Fig. 1 we present the minimum bias charged particle
multiplicity distribution within 2.0 < |η| < 3.0 and transverse momentum (pT) range of
0.2 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c in Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV obtained from AMPT
model. Depending on the centrality selection requirement, the area under the curve is
divided into centrality percentiles. The shaded regions in the ﬁgure show selections in
10% centrality cross-section bins (20% bin is shown for most peripheral collisions). For
experimental data, centralities are selected by Glauber model ﬁts to the minimum-bias
distributions of charged particles [32].

Selection of narrow centrality window is essential for any ﬂuctuation study. For

after the correction 5% centrality bins are similar to those obtained for 1% centrality
bins.

multiplicity ﬂuctuations, this can be understood in terms of a simple participant model.
The number of produced particles (N) in a collision depends on hNparti and the number
of collisions suﬀered by each particle. Mathematically this can be expressed as

N =

Npart

X

i=1

ni

(4)

where ni is the number of particles produced in the η-window of the detector by the ith-
participant. On an average, the mean value of ni is the ratio of the average multiplicity
in the detector coverage to the average number of participants, i.e., hni = hNi/hNparti.
Thus the ﬂuctuation in particle multiplicity is directly related to the ﬂuctuation in
hNparti . In order to infer dynamical ﬂuctuations arising from various physics processes
one has to make sure that the ﬂuctuations in hNparti are minimal.

Selection of narrow centrality bins helps to get rid of inherent ﬂuctuations within a
centrality bin. But it may not be always possible to present the results in such narrow
bins, mainly because of lack of statistics and also because of centrality resolution of
detectors used. It is desirable to choose somewhat wider centrality bins, such as 5% or
10% of the total cross sections. But these choices introduce inherent ﬂuctuations which
need to be corrected. This is done by taking the weighted average of the observables,
such as,

X = Pi niXi
Pi ni

,

(5)

where the index i runs over each multiplicity bin, Xi represents various moments for
the i-th bin, and ni is the number of events in the i-th multiplicity bin. Pi ni = N is
the total number of events in the centrality bin.

This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 in terms of centrality dependence of scaled variance
of the multiplicity distributions for Au+Au collisions at √sN N = 62.4 GeV with the
generated events from the default version of AMPT. Three sets of ωch values are
presented. The values of ωch obtained with 5% centrality bins are much larger compared
to the ones with 1% centrality bins. This variation comes because of wide 5% bins.
After making the correction of the bin width eﬀect, the ﬂuctuations for the 5% cross
section bins reduce by close to ∼ 23% and ∼ 8%, respectively for central and peripheral
collisions, and almost coincide with that of the 1% cross section bin. No centrality bin
width dependence is observed after employing the correction. Thus by choosing narrow
bins in centrality and making centrality bin width correction within each centrality
window, the volume ﬂuctuations are minimised.

4. Multiplicity distributions

Particle multiplicity distributions for diﬀerent beam energies and collision centralities
help to understand the mechanisms of particle production and constrain various models.
Figure 3 shows minimum bias charged particle multiplicity distributions for |η| < 0.5 and
0.2 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at √sN N =19.6 GeV, 27 GeV, 62.4 GeV and
200 GeV, using the default mode of AMPT, and Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV
using the SM mode of AMPT. As seen from the ﬁgure, each distribution gives the
maximum extent of the multiplicity for a given collision energy for a given number of
events. The maximum extent is larger for larger collision energy.

The minimum bias multiplicity distribution is a convolution of multiplicity
distributions with diﬀerent centrality bins. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for charged
particle multiplicity distributions in case of Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV from
the SM mode of AMPT model. Minimum bias distribution as well as distributions at
diﬀerent centrality bins are presented.

Width of the multiplicity distribution for a given centrality gives the extent of the
ﬂuctuation. Thus the physics origin of the ﬂuctuations are inherent in the width of the
multiplicity distributions. One of the ways to understand this to plot the multiplicity
distributions within a centrality bin by scaling it to the mean value of multiplicity

(hNchi). This is presented in Fig. 5 for Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 62.4 and 200 GeV
using default AMPT and Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN =2.76 TeV using the SM mode
of AMPT. The vertical axes are multiplied by diﬀerent factors for better visibility. In
this representation, it is observed that the widths of the distributions are inversely
proportional to volume, that is to hNchi. Thus the distributions become narrower in
going from peripheral to central collisions for all energies. This extensive nature of the
representation is avoided by calculating the scaled variance as deﬁned in Eq. (1).

5. Multiplicity Fluctuations

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations are studied as a function of collision centrality for Au+Au
collisions at √sNN = 7.7 GeV,19.6 GeV, 27 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 200 GeV and Pb+Pb
collisions for √sNN = 2.76 TeV for 5% centrality bins from peripheral to central collisions.
For each centrality bin, the multiplicity distributions are corrected using centrality bin
width correction method. The AMPT model gives the number of participating nucleons
for each centrality bin and so the results are presented as a function of hNparti . The
statistical errors of the µ and σ are calculated using the Delta theorem [33] method.
In most cases,
Errors for ωch are obtained by propagating the errors on µ and σ.

Figure 6 shows the results for µ, σ and ωch as a function of hNparti for ﬁve collision
energies. The left panels show the results for events generated using the default mode
of AMPT and the right panels give the results obtained using SM mode of AMPT. For
√sNN = 2.76 TeV, only the results from the SM mode are presented. It is observed that
for all collision energies, µ and σ increase smoothly in going from peripheral to central
collisions for all energies. The centrality evolution of the moments can be understood
by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) according to which,

µ ∝ hNparti
σ ∝ qhNparti.

(7)
It is to be noted that hNparti is proportional to the volume of the system, and so ωch is
a volume independent term. In Figure 6, µ and σ are ﬁtted with respective CLT-form
as in the above expressions with the constant of proportionality as free parameter. The
CLT curves are superimposed on the AMPT points. The centrality evolution of the
moments follow the trend of the CLT at all energies. Deviations to CLT ﬁts are seen

for central collisions at the highest energy considered.

The bottom panels of Fig. 6 show the scaled variances (ωch) as a function of
centrality for diﬀerent collision energies. The results are similar for both default and SM
modes of AMPT. At low collision energies, ωch show a drop in going from most peripheral
collisions after which the values remain unchanged. At higher energies, ωch remain rather
constant as a function of centrality.

Beam-energy dependences of the multiplicity ﬂuctuations have been studied by
combining results from available experimental data with AMPT model calculations.
Experimental results for heavy-ion collisions are available for WA98 [17] and NA49 [18,
19] experiments at CERN SPS and PHENIX [23] experiment at RHIC. Since these
experimental results are presented for diﬀerent detector acceptances, these have to be
scaled to a common acceptance in order to present in the same ﬁgure. The available
results are scaled for ∆η < 1 using the prescription given Ref. [23]. If ωacc1 represents
the measured scaled variance and ωacc2 is the scaled variance within ∆η < 1, then we

The values of ωacc2 have been calculated from the data provided by the experiments.
Fig. 7 shows the values of ωch for central collisions for WA98, NA49 and PHENIX
experiments. The results for ωch are also presented for two diﬀerent centralities (0-5%
and 50-55% of total cross section) using the default and SM modes of AMPT. A slow rise
in ωch has been observed from low to high collision energy and then remaining constant
at higher energies. The AMPT results overestimate those of NA49 experimental data,
but are close to those of WA98 and PHENIX data. These values are larger compared
to the Poisson expectations.

6. Discussions

Various studies have been reported in the literature in order to explain the values for
multiplicity ﬂuctuations expressed in terms of the scaled variances [7, 10, 14, 23, 36].
Ref. [36] gives a prediction for the values of scaled variance in grand canonical ensemble
(GCE), canonical ensemble (CE) and micro canonical ensemble (MCE) using the hadron
resonance gas model at chemical freeze-out for the central heavy-ion collisions for a wide
collision energy range. According to these calculations, we get a value for ωch between

Fluctuations in Charged Particle Multiplicities in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions 11

1.4 to 1.64 for GCE, 1.06 to 1.64 for CE, and 0.534 to 0.619 for MCE. At higher energies,
the scaled variance is predicted to be similar for CE and GCE. In Ref. [18], it is observed
that, the values for the scaled variance from NA49 experiment is better described by
MCE. Results presented in Fig. 7 are close to the GCE description for higher collision
energies.

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations arise from several known sources such as, detector-
acceptance, ﬂuctuations in the impact parameter, resonance decays, etc.
If particles
produce independently, we always get ωch = 1, but as we move to higher energies, the
non-statistical ﬂuctuations increase and they automatically contribute to the increased
value of the ﬂuctuation as discussed in Ref. [37]. An estimation for the multiplicity
ﬂuctuation can be made in the light of the participant model, where the nucleus-nucleus
collisions are assumed to be superposition of nucleon-nucleon interactions (as described
in Ref. [10]). Here, the total multiplicity ﬂuctuation can be expressed as,

ωch = ωn + hniωNpart

(10)

where, ωn denotes ﬂuctuations in number of the particles produced per participant and
ωNpart is the ﬂuctuation in Npart [10]. Calculation based on this wounded nucleon model
explains the NA49 data for most central collisions [37]. Also it is observed that the
WA98 experiment gives a value of ωn ∼1.8 in one unit of rapidity [17]. From the AMPT
results, we observe that for central collisions, ωn goes down from 1.8 at SPS to 0.8± 0.2

7. Summary

We have presented a comprehensive study on the ﬂuctuations of charged particle
multiplity at mid-rapidity as a function of collision centrality and beam-energy. We have
studied the multiplicity distributions of produced charged particles and their event-by-
event ﬂuctuations from available experimental data for heavy-ion collisions and using
AMPT model calculations. We have demonstrated the importance of the choice of
centrality selection and a detailed discussion on the bin-width eﬀect and its remedy
have been presented. The scaled variance, ωch, has negligible dependence on centrality
and beam energy except in peripheral as well as lower energy collisions. Comparison
with experimental data and AMPT results has been presented after a proper rescaling to
consider the diﬀerence in the geometrical acceptance. The value of ωch at higher energies
and central collisions are found to be ∼2 within the limits of statistical precision. The
model calculations exhibit good agreement with the results from WA98, NA49 and
PHENIX experiments. The values of the ωch are found to be consistent with the
participant model based on the wounded nucleon approximation in both the cases.
Considering a simple factorization of ωch one may argue that ωch is the summation of
particle number ﬂuctuation from each source and ﬂuctuations in the number of sources
itself. Both data and model calculations have no distinct signature of any non-monotonic
variation. Our study oﬀers a baseline for the future endeavour to pursue research on
