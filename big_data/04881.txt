Abstract

The collective dynamics of neuronal populations can be eﬃciently studied using single-compartment
(point) model neurons of the integrate-and-ﬁre (IF) type. Existing point neuron models are intrinsically
not able to appropriately reproduce (i) the eﬀects of dendrites on synaptic input integration or (ii) the
modulation of neuronal activity due to an electric ﬁeld, which strongly depends on the dendritic mor-
phology. Weak electric ﬁelds, as generated endogenously or through transcranial electrical stimulation,
have recently gained increased attention because of their ability to modulate ongoing neuronal activity.
However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we extend the popular spiking point
neuron model class to accurately reﬂect input ﬁltering and weak electric ﬁeld eﬀects as present in a canon-
ical spatially extended “ball-and-stick” (BS) neuron model. We analytically derive additional components
for two major types of IF point neuron models to exactly reproduce the subthreshold somatic voltage
dynamics of the BS model with arbitrary morphology exposed to an oscillating electric ﬁeld. Also the
spiking dynamics for suprathreshold ﬂuctuating inputs is well reproduced by the extended point models.
Through this approach we further show that the presence of a dendritic cable (i) attenuates the somatic
subthreshold response to slowly-varying inputs and (ii) mediates spike rate resonance, or equivalently,
pronounced spike to ﬁeld coherence, in the beta and gamma frequency range due to an oscillatory weak
electric ﬁeld. Our point neuron model extension is simple to implement and well suited for studying the
dynamics of populations with heterogeneous neuronal morphology and the eﬀects of weak electric ﬁelds
on population activity.

Introduction

In the past decades neuron models of the integrate-and-ﬁre (IF) type have been widely used to study
the dynamics of neuronal populations, due to their computationally eﬃciency and analytical tractability
[1]. Several extensions of the classical leaky IF model have been formulated to, for example, yield an
improved description of spike initiation [2] or account for neuronal adaptation and resonance properties
[3–5]. Typical IF point neuron models, consisting of a single compartment, however, do not reproduce
eﬀects due to neuronal morphology in contrast to more complex multi-compartment neuron models. For
example, it has been shown recently that dendritic morphology causes input ﬁltering and spike rate
resonance phenomena, thus substantially shaping the neuronal input-output relations [6]. Furthermore,
an asymmetric dendritic tree – characteristic for cortical pyramidal neurons – mediates somatic membrane
polarization due to extracellular electric ﬁelds [7, 8].

These electric ﬁelds can be generated endogenously [9] or through transcranial (alternating) current
stimulation [10–12] and modify the activity of neuronal populations in various ways [9, 13–15]. Although
the ﬁelds generated by this type of noninvasive brain stimulation are rather weak (≤ 1 V/m [10,11]) such
that they do not directly elicit spikes, they can modulate neuronal spiking activity and lead to changes in
cognitive processing, oﬀering a range of possible clinical interventions [16–18]. However, the mechanisms
underlying the induced changes of neuronal population activity remain largely unknown.

Computational models of neurons exposed to electric ﬁelds oﬀer a useful tool to gain a better un-
derstanding of these mechanisms. Multi-compartment neuron models are well suited for corresponding
investigations at the single cell or small circuit levels [19] but are too complex for purposeful application
in large populations. IF point neuron models, on the other hand, lack the (dendritic) morphology re-
quired for those studies. In this contribution, we therefore extend this popular model class to account
for changes in input integration and the eﬀects of weak extracellular electric ﬁelds due to neuronal mor-
phology. Furthermore, we describe how oscillatory electric ﬁelds aﬀect neuronal subthreshold and spiking
activity and identify ﬁeld-induced spike rate resonance.

Speciﬁcally, we considered a canonical spatial pyramidal neuron model consisting of a somatic com-
partment and the (apical main) dendritic cable, exposed to in-vivo like ﬂuctuating synaptic input and an
electric ﬁeld. Based on that model we analytically derived an extension for the classical leaky and the
reﬁned exponential [2] IF point neuron models in order to exactly reproduce the subthreshold dynamics
of the spatial model with variable morphology. We then evaluated the IF model extension in terms of
reproduction accuracy of spiking activity and ﬁnally described the eﬀects of the electric ﬁeld (due to the
presence of the dendritic cable).

Results

Our derivation of the point neuron model extension consists of the following steps: We ﬁrst analytically
calculate the somatic membrane voltage of a ball-and-stick (BS) pyramidal neuron model in response
to subthreshold synaptic input and a spatially homogeneous but time-varying extracellular electric ﬁeld.
This involves solving a generalized type of cable equation (see next section for the model speciﬁcation). We
then seek to reproduce that voltage response at the soma by the point neuron model, because the somatic
compartment (which eﬀectively includes the axon initial segment here) is the site of spike generation.
For this purpose we derive two additional model components as an extension for the point neuron model
in order to exactly reproduce the subthreshold somatic dynamics of the BS model: (i) a linear temporal
ﬁlter to be applied to the synaptic input and (ii) an additional input current equivalent to the ﬁeld eﬀect
(see Fig. 1). Both new model components are given in terms of explicit expressions that depend on
parameters of the BS model and the electric ﬁeld. We refer to model equipped with the new components
as extended point (eP) neuron model.

neuron model exposed to a synaptic input current Isyn(t) and an electric ﬁeld E(t) (top left) with
electrical circuit diagram (bottom). The two new components of the extended point (eP) neuron model,
i.e., the linear input ﬁlter Ld(t) and the additional input current equivalent to the ﬁeld eﬀect, IE(t), are
derived such that the membrane voltage response of the eP model, VeP(t), reproduces the somatic one
of the BS model, VBS(0, t) (top right). For a description of the parameters and their applied values see
Table 1.

Models

The membrane voltage dynamics of the BS neuron model, consisting of a lumped soma attached to a pas-
sive dendritic cable of length L, exposed to somatic synaptic input Isyn(t) and a (spatially homogeneous)
external electric ﬁeld E(t) is governed by the following equations:

and a reset condition at spike times, i.e., times at which the somatic membrane potential VBS(0, t) crosses
the spike voltage value Vs from below,

if VBS(0, t) ≥ Vs then VBS(0, t) := Vr

(4)

together with a short refractory period of length Tref during which VBS(0, t) is clamped at the reset
value Vr immediately after each spike. Here, VBS denotes the membrane potential deviation from rest
Vrest, VBS(x, t) := VBS,i(x, t) − VBS,e(x, t) − Vrest, where VBS,i and VBS,e are the intra- and extracellular
potentials, respectively. cm is the membrane capacitance, g m is the membrane conductance and g i is
the internal (axial) conductance of a dendritic cable segment of unit length. C s and G s are the somatic

membrane capacitance and leak conductance, respectively. The exponential term with threshold slope
factor ∆T and threshold potential V T approximates the somatic sodium current at spike initiation [2].
For details on the derivation of this BS model and its solution we refer to Methods.

and refractory duration Tref for which VeP is clamped to V (cid:48)
r immediately after spiking. CeP and GeP are
the membrane capacitance and leak conductance. The scaling factor α ensures equal eﬃcacy of the active
depolarizing current described by the exponential terms on the membrane potential in both models. Until
the last part of the paper, we consider ∆T → 0 (and Vs = VT), i.e., we neglect the exponential current.
To mimic the eﬀect of the depolarization along the dendritic cable that remains immediately after a spike
on the soma, we choose an elevated reset voltage for the point neuron model, V (cid:48)
r = (Vr + VT)/2. Below
we explain in detail how the new components for the eP model: Ld(t), IE(t), and (in presence of the
exponential term) α are derived. The expressions for these components are given in Eqs. 10 and 17 (for
∆T → 0), and in Eqs. 22 - 25 (for ∆T > 0). For comparison we also use a point neuron model without
dendritic ﬁlter, i.e., Ld(t) = δ(t) and scaling factor α but otherwise equal to the eP model, which we refer
to as P model.

Somatic input ﬁltering due to the presence of a dendritic cable

We ﬁrst consider a model neuron receiving subthreshold synaptic input at the soma in the absence of an
electric ﬁeld (E(t) = 0, IE(t) = 0). To avoid ambiguity we use superscipt I for the membrane voltage
variables in this case. The somatic membrane voltage responses of the BS model (Eqs. 1–3) and of the P
model (Eq. 5) [recall that the exponential terms are omitted for now] can be analytically calculated. It is
convenient to calculate these responses in the (temporal) frequency domain using the Fourier transform,
where they can be expressed as (see Methods)

can see that in order to exactly reproduce the somatic membrane voltage response of the BS model, i.e.,
ˆV I
eP(ω) = ˆV I

BS(ω), the dendritic ﬁlter must be equal to the impedance ratio of both models:

ˆLd(ω) =

CePiω + GeP

Csiω + Gs + z(ω)gi tanh (z(ω)L)

(10)

with z(ω) given by Eq. 8. Without loss of generality, the membrane capacitance and conductance of the
eP model can be chosen to be equal to the corresponding somatic quantities of the BS model, CeP = Cs,

GeP = Gs. To see the necessity of the ﬁlter let us consider the P model (without dendritic ﬁlter,
ˆLd(ω) = 1) for comparison, whose subthreshold response is given by

ˆV I
P (ω) =

The (somatic) subthreshold voltage responses in terms of impedance, Zm(ω) := ˆV I

Compared to the simple point model P, the subthreshold response of the BS hold an additional dependence
in ω in its denominator due to the presence of the dendritic cable. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve
ˆV I
P (ω) = ˆV I
BS(ω) for all frequencies ω by adjusting the (constant) parameters CP and GP. The somatic
response of the BS model can only be approximated in this case.
m(ω)/ ˆIsyn(ω), m ∈
{BS|x=0, eP, P} of the three neuron models are shown in Fig. 2A. The two parameters of the P model (CP
and GP) were determined by matching the steady-state somatic voltage exactly, i.e., ZP(0) = ZBS(0) and
minimizing the distance between ZP and ZBS over the visualized range of frequencies. The impedance of
the eP model matches the one of BS model exactly (due to the dendritic ﬁlter), whereas the impedance
of the P model deviates substantially, in particular, for larger frequencies.

The input ﬁlter in terms of amplitude and phase of its Fourier transform ˆLd(ω) for various mor-
phologies of the BS model are shown in Fig. 2B-D. In general, the ﬁlter exhibits high pass properties,
attenuating lower frequencies and amplifying higher ones, as can be seen by the ﬁlter magnitude. This
eﬀect is more pronounced for larger dendrites and smaller somas; speciﬁcally, it becomes stronger with
increasing ratio of dendritic surface over somatic one. Qualitatively, however, the ﬁlter does not change
across these morphologies.

We next compare how well the point neurons models (eP and P) reproduce the spiking activity of
the BS model neuron. For this purpose we consider an in vivo-like ﬂuctuating synaptic input current
described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (see Methods) and a range of values for the input mean I0
and its standard deviation σ. The parameter values of the P model were adjusted to best reproduce the
spike train of the BS model (see Methods for more details). The (somatic) membrane voltage time series
of the 3 models in response to the same input current – a noise dominated (small I0, large σ) and a mean
dominated current (large I0, small σ) – are shown in Fig 3A. For both input currents the eP membrane
voltage well reproduces the (somatic) one and consequently, the spike times are also well matched. There
is only a temporary mismatch in the voltages during short periods right after spikes. This is caused by
the rough eﬀective approximation of the remaining dendritic depolarization immediately after spiking
(see section Models above). In contrast, the P model fails to reproduce the fast ﬂuctuations of the BS
membrane voltage, as expected from Fig. 2A, and thus, spike time reproduction using that model is quite
poor.

In Fig. 3B-E we compare the spike coincidence measure Γ (see Methods) and rates for a wide range of
inputs. The parameter values of the P model were calibrated for each input (in terms of I0, σ) separately.
Note that the eP model parameters, on the other hand, do not depend on the input. The eP model
very accurately reproduces the BS spike times for small spike rates (small I0 and σ), see Fig. 3B,E. This
performance decreases only a bit for increasing σ (noise dominated input) and somewhat stronger for
increasing I0 (mean dominated input). For larger spike rates the transient periods after spiking, during
which the membrane voltages of the eP and BS models more strongly deviate from each other, become
larger relative to the interspike interval. This can explain the corresponding decrease in Γ. In addition,
when σ is small the model neurons spike repetitively in a rather clock-like manner, with comparable rate
but most likely out of phase (particularly in the extreme case of I0 > 0, σ → 0; not shown here). This
helps understand the rather low values of Γ for mean dominated inputs. The spike rate of the BS model is
also reproduced quite well by the eP model, which underestimates it only slightly (Fig. 3D). The P model,
in comparison, is substantially worse in reproducing the spike times at small spike rates and only slightly
better than the eP model for large spike rates (Fig. 3B,C). The spike rate of the BS model is slightly
overestimated by the P model (Fig. 3D). Despite clear overﬁtting for the P model (whose parameter

the BS spiking activity overall.

Eﬀect of an extracellular electric ﬁeld on the neuronal dynamics

In the previous section we extended a point neuron model of the LIF type in order to reproduce the
high-pass ﬁltering of synaptic input at the soma due to the presence of a dendritic cable. Here, we focus
on the eﬀect of an extracellular electric ﬁeld on the somatic membrane voltage and spiking dynamics –
due to the dendritic spatial extent of the neuron – and extend the point neuron model to reproduce these
eﬀects. The electric ﬁelds we are interested in are oscillatory, uniform (on the spatial scale of the neuron)
and weak such as induced by transcranial brain stimulation [12]. The subthreshold somatic membrane

where z(ω) is given by Eq. 8. Note, that we again neglect the exponential current in this section (∆T → 0,

and we set CeP = Cs, GeP = Gs (as before). It should be noted that these results are not restricted to
sinusoidal ﬁelds, as considered here, and can be easily adjusted for any other time varying ﬁeld using its
Fourier transform.
The amplitude |B(ϕ)| and phase diﬀerence arg(B(ϕ)) of the equivalent input current IE(t) (relative
m (ω)/E1, m ∈ {BS|x=0, eP}
to the ﬁeld E(t)) as well as the (somatic) sensitivity to the ﬁeld, deﬁned as ˆV E
m (ω)|/E1 and phase shift arg( ˆV E
in terms of amplitude | ˆV E
m (ω))/E1 of the (somatic) voltage response
are shown in Fig. 4.
Interestingly, the amplitude of IE(t) increases with increasing ﬁeld frequency
(Fig. 4A). The subthreshold sensitivity to the ﬁeld changes quantitatively, but not qualitatively, with
varying neuronal morphology (Fig. 4B). Speciﬁcally, it generally decreases with increasing ﬁeld frequency,
and this decrease becomes more pronounced with increasing ratio of dendritic surface over somatic one.
The cable length shows the largest impact in this respect. Note, that consequently the BS morphology
also aﬀects the input current IE(t) quantitatively, but not qualitatively (not shown).

We next assess how the electric ﬁeld aﬀects spiking activity for a range of ﬁeld frequencies using the
BS and eP models. For that purpose we quantiﬁed the ﬁeld-induced oscillatory spike rate modulation
r1(ϕ) sin(ϕt + ψ(ϕ)) around a constant spike rate r0 that is due to the synaptic input, measured over
many trials (see Methods for further details). Note, that this spike rate modulation measure is related
to the frequently used spike ﬁeld coherence measure. The amplitude r1 and phase shift ψ of the rate
modulation for various inputs (in terms of I0 and σ) and two ﬁeld strengths are shown in Fig. 5. The eP
model well reproduces the spike rate dynamics of the BS model exposed to the ﬁeld, for all considered
ﬁeld and input parameter values. In contrast to the subthreshold sensitivity to the ﬁeld (cf. Fig. 4B),
the spike rate modulation exhibits a clear resonance (i.e., an amplitude peak) in the beta and gamma
frequency bands across the diﬀerent inputs. This resonance is more pronounced for stronger inputs and
most prominent when the input is dominated by its mean (large I0, small σ). The amplitude r1 increases
linearly with increasing ﬁeld magnitude E1, except for mean dominated inputs where r1 increases rather
sublinearly with E1.

1050 µm), its diameter (0.6 µm, 1.2 µm, 1.8 µm) and soma diameter (5 µm, 10 µm, 15 µm). ∗ indicates
the default parameter values. For all (other) parameter values used see Table 1.

To demonstrate the importance of the speciﬁc shape of IE(t) we also considered, as an alternative,
a sinusoidal input current IE(t) = I1 sin(ϕt) for the eP model, whose amplitude and phase shift were
constant across diﬀerent ﬁeld frequencies. Using that current, the typical resonance of the spike rate
modulation due to the ﬁeld cannot even roughly be reproduced (Fig. 5).

Extension for Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF) model neurons

In the previous section we derived an extended point neuron model of the LIF type to account for
synaptic input ﬁltering and the eﬀects of an extracellular electric ﬁeld due to a dendritic cable, considering
capacitive and leak currents through the neuronal membrane. Here we consider the BS and eP models
described by Eqs. 1–3, 5 (without neglecting the exponential terms) and evaluate the extended point
neuron model of the EIF type.

the eP model for which IE was given by IE(t) = I1 sin(ϕt) with constant amplitude I1 (equal to the
amplitude of IE from Eq. 17 with ϕ = 0.5 Hz and E1 = 10 V/m). Note the diﬀerent amplitude scales in
the two top plots.

To derive the model components Ld, α and IE we linearize the exponential terms around a baseline
voltage value V0 and then proceed similarly as above. Speciﬁcally, for the overall subthreshold somatic

where the ﬁeld is deﬁned in Eq. 12. Note that the scaling factor α is derived in order to reproduce the
BS somatic steady-state response to a subthreshold input. This factor basically ensures that the current
described by the exponential term equally contributes to the steady state in both models.

To assess the reproduction of spiking activity in presence of the spike generating current described by
the exponential term (i.e., using EIF type models), we apply the spike coincidence factor Γ and compare
the spike rates of the BS, eP and P models in Fig. 6, similarly as above (where ∆T → 0). Also here the
parameter values of the P model is adjusted to maximize ΓBS,P for each input separately. The range of
input parameter values is chosen to obtain similar spike rates as in Fig. 3. The eP model successfully
reproduces the BS spike trains. In particular, ΓBS,eP is very large for small spike rates (small I0 and
σ) and decreases a bit for increasing I0 (towards mean dominated input), see Fig. 6A,D. Also the spike
rate of the BS neuron is quite well matched by the one of the eP model neuron (Fig. 6C). Interestingly,
the spiking reproduction performance of the eP model here depends less on the spike rate as compared
to the LIF case (cf. Fig. 3). This can be attributed to the decreased spike threshold sharpness due the
exponential term. The P model, on the other hand, rather poorly reproduces the BS spiking dynamics
for small input noise intensity σ (Fig. 6A). Overall the eP model outperforms the simpler P model also
in presence of the exponential term (Fig. 6B).

Discussion

In this contribution we presented an extension for IF type point model neurons to accurately reﬂect
synaptic input ﬁltering eﬀects and the inﬂuence of an oscillatory weak electric ﬁeld on the neuronal
dynamics. Based on a canonical spatial BS neuron model which describes the somatic and dendritic
membrane voltage activity we analytically derived additional components for the leaky and exponential
IF point neuron models to exactly reproduce the BS subthreshold voltage dynamics.

These (new) components consist of (i) a linear ﬁlter for application to the synaptic input and (ii) an
additional input current equivalent to the ﬁeld eﬀect on the membrane voltage. In case of the EIF model
neuron we additionally derived a scaling parameter to best match the BS voltage dynamics. Exhaustive
evaluations for suprathreshold in-vivo like ﬂuctuating inputs have demonstrated that also the BS spiking

activity is well reproduced by the extended point models. Optimizing the parameters of a standard (LIF
or EIF) point neuron model without the derived extension does not suﬃce to adequately reproduce the
important dynamical features of the BS model.

Due to its computational eﬃciency this point neuron extension is well suited for application in spiking
networks to investigate, for example, the eﬀects of neuronal morphology and electrical ﬁelds on neuronal
activity at the population level. Additionally, our methodological results serve as a building block to
derive accurate (mean-ﬁeld) descriptions for the spiking activity of large coupled populations [1,5,20], [21,
Chapter 4.2].

Synaptic input ﬁltering due to the dendrite

Through our approach we showed that the presence of the dendrite enhances the somatic subthreshold
response to high-frequency inputs compared to slowly-varying ones, in a morphology dependent man-
ner. This is consistent with recent results [6] on the impact of neuronal morphology on synaptic input
integration in Purkinje cells from electrophysiology and computational models.

Here, we focused on synaptic input at the soma. Inputs at the dendrite instead, however, result in
diﬀerent neuronal response properties [6]. Using the presented approach an additional linear ﬁlter for

12

inputs at the (distal) dendrite can be analytically derived in a straightforward way (not shown). This
would result in one more component for the extended point models. An alternative extension for point
model neurons to eﬀectively incorporate synaptic input along the dendritic tree of model neurons with
complex morphology has been proposed in [22]. The methodology used there, however, practically limits
the number of synaptic input locations to only a few for reasons of computational complexity.

Another limitation of our model is the absence of nonlinear (spike-generating) currents along the
dendrite, which leads to nonlinear synaptic input integration [23–25]. This could be considered in a “quasi-
active” framework [26], by solving the cable equation with linearized nonlinear components, similarly as
for the exponential terms used here (EIF type model).

Eﬀects of weak electric ﬁelds on neuronal activity

Additionally, we studied the eﬀect of a spatially homogeneous oscillating weak electric ﬁeld, as induced
during transcranial electrical stimulation, on the activity of the BS neuron. We analytically calculated
the subthreshold somatic membrane voltage response, whose properties are in accordance with several
electrophysiological observations: (i) the response magnitude scales linearly with the ﬁeld amplitude [27],
as shown by the sensitivity in Fig. 4, and (ii) this sensitivity is of the same order of magnitude as
that measured in pyramidal cells [7], i.e., around 0.30 mm for low frequency ﬁelds, and decreasing with
increasing ﬁeld frequency in a morphology dependent manner [8].

Further we found a clear resonance in the spike rate modulation (and hence, spike ﬁeld coherence)
caused by the electric ﬁeld for beta and gamma frequency bands, depending on the synaptic input (and
neuronal morphology; not shown). Although the eﬀect of weak extracellular oscillations on the phase
locking of spikes has been recently studied using complex cells models [19], the computational cost and
huge amount of parameters does not allow for a systematic study considering diﬀerent ﬁeld frequencies.
The here described resonance in spiking induced by the ﬁeld is of potential interest for the design of
transcranial electrical stimulation protocols.

Besides the synaptic input ﬁlter due to the presence of the dendritic cable, we analytically derived an
input current expression for the point model neurons to reproduce the eﬀect of the ﬁeld as extracted from
the BS model. The parameters (here: amplitude and phase) of this biophysically developed input current
depend on the parameters of the BS neuron and the electric ﬁeld. Previously, simple phenomenologically
obtained input currents have been used for point neuron network simulations, with either constant ampli-
tudes (across frequencies) [9, 15] or amplitudes ﬁtted to electrophysiological data [13]. Interestingly, the
latter study used an input current with low-pass properties, in contrast to the rather high-pass current
we obtained. The neuronal subthreshold sensitivity in that study and the ones shown here, however, are
similar. This apparent discrepancy in the currents describing the ﬁeld eﬀect may be explained by the
impedance of the applied model neurons, which naturally inﬂuences the equivalent input current. In [13]
the model parameters (and thus the impedance) were not ﬁtted to real cells; hence it is unlikely that
the model impedance matched with the impedance of the cells from which the current amplitudes were
estimated [7]. The successful reproduction of the BS rate modulation due to the ﬁeld by the eP model
presented here supports the high-pass properties of the equivalent input current.

Here, we derived extension for point neuron models of the LIF and EIF type. Additional slow (adap-
tation) model variables [4] which reﬂect slow potassium channels and account for spike rate adaptation (a
prominent feature of pyramidal cells) and associated input-output properties [28,29] may also be included
in this framework. In that case a separation of timescales argument can be used to derive the model
extension.

Methods

The ball-and-stick (BS) neuron model

Model derivation The BS neuron model consists of a ﬁnite passive dendritic cable of length L with a
lumped somatic compartment at the extremity x = 0, exposed to synaptic input Isyn(t) at the soma and
an electric ﬁeld E(t) (see Fig. 1). The electric ﬁeld is spatially uniform at the scale of the neuron, which
is considered a valid assumption for ﬁelds induced by transcranial brain stimulation [12]. Assuming a
homogeneous, purely ohmic medium [30] the subthreshold dynamics of the membrane voltage VBS(x, t) :=
VBS,i(x, t) − VBS,e(x, t) − Vrest along the dendritic cable are governed by [31]

where VBS,i and VBS,e are the intra- and extracellular potentials, respectively, cm = cDdπ is the membrane
capacitance per unit length, gi = i(Dd/2)2π is the internal (axial) conductance per unit length and
gm = mDdπ is the membrane conductance per unit length. c is the speciﬁc membrane capacitance
(in F/m2), i is the speciﬁc internal conductance (in S/m), m is the speciﬁc membrane conductance (in
S/m2) and Dd is the cable diameter. Note, that the rightmost equality in Eq. 26 is due to our assumption
of a spatially uniform electric ﬁeld E(x, t) ≡ E(t).

At the proximal end of the dendritic cable, x = 0, we consider a lumped soma, assuming that the
somatic diameter Ds is small compared to the cable length L. The corresponding boundary condition is
given by [32]

The subthreshold voltage dynamics of the BS model are thus determined by Eqs. 26, 29 and 31. The
spiking mechanism is implemented by the reset condition 4 with refractory period (see Models in the
section Results).

Calculation of the subthreshold somatic response To analytically calculate the somatic membrane
voltage response of the BS model we consider small variations of the synaptic input Isyn(t) and a weak
oscillatory electric ﬁeld E(t). This allows us to linearize the exponential term in Eq. 29 around the
steady-state somatic voltage value V0 to obtain

The subthreshold voltage dynamics of the eP model is speciﬁed by Eq. 5 which is complemented by the

Calculation of the subthreshold response We consider again small variations of the synaptic input

Numerical simulation

input Isyn(t). Speciﬁcally, Isyn was described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

with mean I0, correlation time τ and standard deviation σ. ξ(t) is a Gaussian white noise process [with
zero mean (cid:104)ξ(t)(cid:105) = 0 and delta autocorrelation (cid:104)ξ(t)ξ(t + t(cid:48))(cid:105) = δ(t(cid:48))], where (cid:104).(cid:105) denotes the expectation
operator. Eq. 46 was numerically solved using the method described in [39].

The electric ﬁeld was described by

E(t) = E1 sin(ϕt),

(47)

(same as Eq. 12) with amplitude E1 and (angular) frequency ϕ = 2πf . The (range of) values for all
parameters are provided in table 1.

Ball-and-stick neuron model The BS neuron model was numerically solved using the NEURON
simulation environment [40]. We applied a ﬁnite diﬀerence space discretization scheme with 50 segments
for the dendritic cable and the implicit (or backward) Euler time discretization scheme with time step
0.05 ms when the exponential term was omitted (∆T → 0) and 0.025 ms otherwise. Decreasing the time
step size and increasing the number of segments did not lead to noticeable changes in the membrane volt-
age time series. The time-varying extracellular potential was included using the built-in “extracellular”
mechanism in NEURON.

Point neuron model The point neuron models (with dendritic ﬁlter: eP model and without: P
model) were numerically solved using the forward Euler time discretization scheme and the same time
step as used for the BS model. The solution method was implemented in Python using the library
“Numba” for fast computation. Both point model neurons received the same realization of synaptic
input Isyn(t) as the BS model neuron. The linear ﬁlter Ld(t) in the eP model was implemented using the

fast Fourier transform (FFT) of Isyn(t) and the inverse FFT of ˆLd(ω) ˆIsyn(ω). The membrane capacitance
and conductance of the eP model were chosen as equal to the corresponding somatic quantities of the BS
model, CeP = Cs, GeP = Gs. Except stated otherwise, the corresponding parameter values of the P model
were determined by ﬁtting the BS model spiking activity in terms of spike coincidences. Speciﬁcally, GP
was chosen such that the steady-state (somatic) membrane voltage of the BS model is matched exactly,
i.e. ZP(0) = ZBS(0) where the neuron models impedance are deﬁned by Zm(ω) := ˆV I
m(ω)/ ˆIsyn(ω),
m ∈ {BS|x=0, P} using Eqs. 7 and 11. The value for CP was then selected to maximize the coincidence
factor Γ (deﬁned below) between 52 s lasting spike trains of the BS and P model neurons for each shown
pair (I0, σ) of input parameter values.
In presence of the exponential term in the models (∆T > 0)
we used V0 = Vr, which is the steady-state (somatic) voltage in the absence of synaptic input. Using a
diﬀerent value for V0 did not lead to a substantial improvement of the reproduction performance. Several
values were tested in the range [Vr, Vs] (results not shown).

17

Analysis methods for the spike trains

Spike coincidence measure In order to compare the spiking time of the diﬀerent neuron model, the
coincidence factor was used. To quantify the similarity between the spike trains of the diﬀerent model
neurons we used the coincidence factor Γ deﬁned by [41]

Γref,comp =

Ncoinc − (cid:104)Ncoinc(cid:105)
(Nref + Ncomp)/2

1
N ,

(48)

where Nc is the number of coincident spikes with precision (i.e., maximal temporal separation) ∆, Nref
and Ncomp are the number of spikes in the reference spike train and in the one being compared to it,
respectively. (cid:104)Ncoinc(cid:105) = 2r∆Nref is the expected number of coincidences generated by a homogeneous
Poisson process with the same spike rate r = Ncomp/T as that shown by the compared spike train, where
T is the spike train duration. The factor N = 1 − 2r∆ normalizes Γref,comp to a maximum value of 1
which is reached if the spike trains match optimally (with precision ∆). Γref,comp = 0 on the other hand
would result from a homogeneous Poisson process with the same number of spikes as in the reference
spike train and thus indicates pure chance.

Spike rate resonance and phase shift measure To examine and compare how the instantaneous
spike rate of the model neurons responds to an oscillatory electric ﬁeld E(t) (Eq. 47) in the presence
of noisy synaptic background current Isyn(t) (Eq. 46) we considered regimes (in terms of (I0, σ)-pairs)
where the synaptic drive is suﬃciently strong to cause the neuron to spike stochastically with rate r0.
The sinusoidal ﬁeld then causes a modulation of the spike rate that becomes apparent over many trials
(i.e., independent realizations of Isyn(t)). This quantity can also be thought of as the spike rate, averaged
over a population of neurons which individually receive a noisy synaptic drive but collectively respond to
the same oscillatory ﬁeld. This population, or trial-averaged instantaneous spike rate can be expressed
as

r(t) = r0 + r1(ϕ) sin(ϕt + ψ(ϕ)),

(49)

where r1 and ψ denote the amplitude and phase shift, respectively, both of which depend on the (angular)
frequency ϕ of the ﬁeld. Note that in the eP model the ﬁeld eﬀect is described by the oscillatory current
IE(t). To estimate the spike rate modulation at a given ﬁeld frequency we ﬁrst extracted and collected the
ﬁeld phase φs ∈ [0, 2π) for each spike time ts, such that E(ts) = E0 sin(φs). These phases were calculated
from 944 trials of at least 26 s duration each, for which the ﬁrst 2 s were disregarded to avoid transients
and only complete ﬁeld cycles were considered. We then computed a spike rate histogram from the set
{φs} using 20 equally sized bins and ﬁnally applied a sinusoid of the form F (φ) = r0 + r1 sin(φ + ψ) with
φ ∈ [0, 2π) to ﬁt that histogram using the method of least squares, where r0 was given by the histogram
mean value. In this way we obtained r1 and ψ.
