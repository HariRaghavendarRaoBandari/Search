Multi-terminal superconducting Josephson junctions
based on the proximity effect offer the bright opportunity
to tailor non trivial quantum states in nanoscale weak-
links. These structures can realize exotic topologies in
multidimensions [1] as, for example, artiﬁcial topological
superconductors able to support Majorana bound states
[2, 3], and pave the way to emerging quantum technolo-
gies [4–7] and future quantum information schemes [8].
Here, we report the ﬁrst realization of a three-terminal
Josephson interferometer based on a proximized nano-
sized weak-link. Our tunneling spectroscopy measure-
ments reveal transitions between gapped (i.e., insulating)
and gapless (i.e., conducting) states, those being controlled
by the phase conﬁguration of the three superconducting
leads connected to the junction. We demonstrate the topo-
logical nature of these transitions: a gapless state nec-
essarily occurs between two gapped states of different
topological index, very much like the interface between
two insulators of different topology is necessarily con-
ducting [9]. The topological numbers characterizing such
gapped states are given by superconducting phase wind-
ings over the two loops forming the Josephson interfer-
ometer. Since these gapped states cannot be transformed
to one another continuously withouth passing through a
gapless condition, these are topologically protected. Our
observation of the gapless state is pivotal for enabling
phase engineering of more sophisticated artiﬁcial topo-
logical materials realizing Weyl points or the anomalous
Josephson effect [1, 4–7, 10].

When two superconductors (S) are coupled through a nor-
mal metal (N), they realize a Josephson junction (JJ) and su-
perconducting correlations are induced in the N region due
to proximity effect [11–16]. As a consequence, the N metal
acquires genuine superconducting-like properties such as the
ability to sustain a supercurrent, and a gap in the density of
states (DoS) whose amplitude can be controlled by the macro-
scopic phase difference between the S leads [12, 17–19]. This
process therefore enables the N region to possess a charac-
ter ranging from insulating-like (gapped state) to conducting-
like (gapless state) [14, 17].
Although two-terminal JJs
based on proximity effect have been at the focus of an intense
research for several years [11–21], three-terminal junctions
have been only recently realized to investigate the physics
of multiple crossed Andreev reﬂections existing in metallic

weak-links [10]. Yet, the impact and control over three su-
perconducting phases acting on a nanosized N region have
never been explored so far despite recent predictions of using
multi-terminal JJs for tailoring and controlling exotic quantum
states. [1, 4, 6, 10]. Indeed, multi-terminal (>2) JJs allow
the spin-orbit interaction to affect substantially the Andreev
bound levels enabling the manipulation of electrons in sin-

as the radial vector pointing at the intersection among the three arrows representing the weak-link in a gapped state. Between each distinct
topological conﬁguration this quantum state necessarily evolves through a gapless state deviating from the equator towards the North pole

gle fermionic states [6]. This is required for spin qubits [22]
and spintronic applications [23], and can provide an alterna-
tive route towards the spooky Majorana bound states of topo-
logical superconductors [24], or the fundamental physics of
Weyl singularities accessible in four or more terminal JJs [5].

Here we report the realization of the ﬁrst phase-tunable
three-terminal JJ interferometer based on proximity effect, in
the following referred to as the ω-superconducting quantum
interference proximity transistor (ω-SQUIPT) due to its char-
acteristic shape (see Fig. 1). As shown below, this hybrid
multi-terminal geometry allows to access a unique class of
topologies deﬁned in the (two-dimensional) domain of the su-
perconducting phases thereby realizing a Josephson topologi-
cal material.

The ω-SQUIPT is fabricated by electron-beam lithography,
three-angle shadow-mask evaporation of metals, and in situ
oxidation (see Methods for further details). It essentially con-
sists of three different parts, as shown in Fig. 1a. Aluminum
(Al) is used to form the superconducting double-ring structure
consisting of three leads converging into a nanosized T-shaped
copper (Cu) weak-link. A N electrode made of Al0.98Mn0.02 is
tunnel coupled to the center of the T-shaped region, and allows
to probe the weak-link DoS through tunneling conductance
measurements. Speciﬁcally, at ﬁnite temperature the tunnel-
ing conductance (G) of the interferometer, measured accord-

ing to the scheme presented in Fig. 1b, is given by

where ¯NN(E,ΦL,ΦR) is the DoS in the T-shaped region av-
eraged over the probing junction area, V is the voltage drop
across the tunnel junction, ΦL and ΦR are the magnetic ﬂuxes
piercing the left and right loop, respectively, and F0 is the
Fermi-Dirac energy distribution function. Moreover, RT is
the normal-state resistance of the junction and e denotes the
electron charge.

Two different families of ω-SQUIPTs were fabricated and
characterized: the A-type interferometer (shown in ﬁgure 1a),
and the B-type one which is less symmetric with respect to
the length of the arms forming the T-shaped region, and to the
resistances of the three Cu/Al interfaces. These two families
of interferometers allow to access different topologies of the
electron states in the weak-link by tuning the external mag-
netic ﬂux, as shown in Fig 2. In analogy with conventional
topological insulators we assign to the gapped (insulating)
states of the weak-link a topological index deﬁned by a couple
of discrete numbers (nL,nR) obtained via the line integral of
the superconducting-phase gradient ((cid:126)∇ϕ(r)) over the left and
right S loops of the interferometer (see Fig 2a). This index,
similarly to the Chern number, identiﬁes univocally different

which stems from the measurement setup. The normal-state resistance RT of the A(B)-type interferometer is ∼ 6.5kΩ (∼ 8kΩ). b,d, Color

topologies of the gapped states. These are represented by the
blue regions in the plots of the DoS at the Fermi energy calcu-
lated in Fig. 2b,c as a function of the magnetic ﬂuxes ΦL and
ΦR for the A-type and B-type ω-SQUIPT, respectively. In full
analogy with the physics of topological insulators, the inter-
face between two regions characterized by different topolo-
gies is a conductive state represented by the green (gapless)
area appearing in the plots of the DoS. The main difference be-
tween the diagrams of the two families lies in the shape of the
gapped blue zones, which is characterized by a pronounced
skewing in B-type interferometer (Fig. 2c). This allows the
crossing between the four different topologies (00,10,01,11)
and the dotted line deﬁned by the relation ΦL = ΦR, the lat-
ter representing the phase space accessible in our experiment.
Therefore, in A-type interferometer a single topological tran-
sition between 00 and 11 gapped states is expected to occur
within a ﬂux quantum Φ0 (Φ0 (cid:39) 2× 10−15 Wb). By contrast,

in B-type ω-SQUIPTs all the four different topologies can be
explored within the same magnetic-ﬂux interval.

The peculiar topological protection among different states-
can be understood with the aid of the vectorial representa-
tion of the electron states in the weak-link [25] displayed in
Fig 2d,e. In this picture the electron states are mapped through
the position of an unitary vector in a hemisphere (see Fig. 2f),
with a longitudinal angle (ϕ) representing the superconduct-
ing phase, and a latitudinal angle (θ) deﬁning the degree of
”superconductivity” of the weak-link [see Eq. (2) and Sup-
plementary Information]. In particular, the North pole (θ = 0,
identiﬁed by a cross on top of each sphere) corresponds to
a N-like behaviour (gapless state) whereas the equator line
(θ = π/2) represents an ideal superconductor (gapped state)
with phase ϕ. The four distinct topologies shown in Fig. 2c,d
corresponding to (nL nR) = (00), (10), (01), (11) are then pro-
tected since cannot be continuously transformed into another,

ﬂux G(Vbias,Φ) measured at several bath temperatures Tbath for the A-type (a) and the B-type (b) interferometer. The double-minigap feature

without pulling them out of the equator. In other words, each
topological transition requires therefore the state vector (i.e.,
the electronic conﬁguration of the T-shaped weak-link) to de-
viate from the equator resulting into a gapless state. Fig-
ures 2d,e sketch the evolution of these transitions between
different topologies along the ΦL = ΦR ﬂux path (see Sup-
plementary Information for further details).

These two distinct kinds of topological

transitions are
clearly observed in our interferometers. Figure 3a,b (left pan-
els) shows the characteristic behaviour of the tunneling con-
ductance (G) of the A-type ω-SQUIPT measured at 30 mK
versus bias voltage (Vbias) and magnetic ﬂux (Φ = ΦL = ΦR).
Experimental data are directly compared to the conductance
spectra calculated from Eq. (1) for the T-shaped diffusive Cu
weak-link (see Methods for details). The comparison demon-
strates the nearly optimal agreement between theory and ex-
periment. Notably, two different regimes are clearly visible
in the G(Vbias,Φ) spectrum (see Fig. 3b): one occurring for
|Φ/Φ0| (cid:46) 1/4 (with Φ0 periodicity) characterized by the pres-
ence of a ﬁnite minigap, and another for 1/4 (cid:46) Φ/Φ0 (cid:46) 3/4
where the minigap is almost absent. The remaining small con-
ductance dip, still visible around zero bias for Φ = 0.5Φ0
(see Fig.
3a), stems from the ﬁnite size of the probing
junction which provides an averaged DoS of the weak-link
over the tunneling area. While the gapped regions provide
a physics apparently similar to that observed in two-terminal
JJs [12, 19], the existence of a gapless regime furnishes the
experimental proof of a phase-induced topological transition
from the 00 to the 11 topological state occurring in the three-
terminal weak-link [4, 6]. Between these two states the en-
ergy spectrum of Andreev bound states which determine the

weak-link conductance crosses the (zero-energy) Fermi level
within a continuos band of magnetic-ﬂux values [4]. As a
consequence of this energy crossing, a normal metal-like con-
ductivity at zero-bias is recovered.

To further validate the above given theoretical interpretation
we extend the analysis of the three-terminal interferometer to
the more asymmetric B-type conﬁguration. A small change
in the symmetry of the JJs forming the structure indeed dras-
tically affects and modiﬁes the characteristic behaviour of the
ω-SQUIPT (see Fig. 3c,d), and a small gapped region appears
also for 1/4 (cid:46) Φ/Φ0 (cid:46) 3/4. As displayed in the phase dia-
gram of Fig. 2c, we ascribe the existence of this second in-
sulating region to the presence of two additional topologies
(10,01) which become accessible when the two lateral S leads
are more asymmetrically coupled to the T-shaped weak-link.
This complementary proof conﬁrms the good agreement be-
tween the experiment and the topological picture given for the
three-terminal JJ.

The robustness against bath temperature (Tbath) of the ob-
served topological transitions for both types of interferometers
is quantiﬁed in Fig. 4. In particular, it shows the temperature
evolution of the tunneling conductance spectra G(Vbias,Φ) for
the A- (pannel a) and B-type (pannel b) ω-SQUIPTs. As ex-
pected, the impact of Fermi distribution at ﬁnite temperature
manifests itself via a broadening of G, and through a gradual
fade-out of its main features by increasing Tbath. In particular,
the topological gapped regions 10 and 01 are still clearly ob-
servable up to ∼ 300 mK whereas the 00 and 11 topologies
persist up to ∼ 500 mK. Access to higher temperatures is ex-
pected to occur by reducing the weak-link size [17] as well as
by increasing the energy gap of the S loops [26].

In summary, we have realized the ﬁrst double-loop su-
perconducting quantum interference proximity transistor with
three superconducting terminals. This structure promotes an
additional phase control as compared to the more conven-
tional two-terminal geometry, and allows an exotic phase-
engineering of the weak-link topology which manifests it-
self in the peculiar behaviour of the interferometer conduc-
tance. The gapped states induced in the weak-link realize a
(two-dimensional) Josephson topological material univocally
classiﬁed by a topological index tunable via an external mag-
netic ﬁeld. Phase-tuning of the ω-SQUIPTs allowed the ac-
cess to a Φ0-periodic topological transition showing up in a
continuos magnetic-ﬂux interval 1/4 (cid:46) Φ/Φ0 (cid:46) 3/4. Yet, in-
creasing the asymmetry of the JJs forming the interferometer
leads to the appearance of a second gapped state which reveals
the presence of two additional topological phases induced in
the weak-link, in full quantitative agreement with our topo-
logical model. Being the ﬁrst experimental demonstration of
ultimate theories on multi-terminal Josephson junctions, this
class of interferometers paves the avenue for future coherent
nanoscale devices where quantum technology and fundamen-
tal research merge to be one [2, 8]. In this perspective, the
ω-SQUIPT could be easily combined with hybrid nanocir-
cuits based on, e.g., semiconducting nanowires [27], low di-
mensional systems [28], graphene [29] or superconductors to
enhance its functionalities. Yet, supplying the interferometer
with independent on-chip coils, which provide separate con-
trol over the two magnetic ﬂuxes, would assure to master in-
dependently phase-biasing in left and right loop. Finally, the
addition of more superconducting terminals will increase the
phase dimensionality of the weak-link electron states enabling
further artiﬁcial topologies [1].

METHODS

Fabrication details and experimental set-up.

The
ω-SQUIPTs were fabricated with electron-beam lithography
and three-angle shadow-mask evaporation of metals onto an
oxidized Si wafer through a bilayer resist mask. The evap-
orations and oxidation were made in an ultra-high vacuum
electron-beam evaporator, which allowed us to deposit ﬁrst
15 nm of Al0.98Mn0.02 at an angle of 40◦ to form the N probe.
Then the sample was exposed to 40 mTorr of O2 for 5 minutes
to realize the insulating layer of Al0.98Mn0.02Ox forming the
tunnel barrier. Afterwards, the sample was tilted at an angle of
20◦, and 25 nm of Cu were deposited to realize the T-shaped
N wire. Finally, 150 nm of Al were evaporated at an angle of
0◦ to implement the double S ring with three terminals SL,
SC, and SR (see Fig.1b). To achieve full phase polarization
the ω-SQUIPT requires a superconducting double-loop with
a cross section much larger than the T-shaped N wire in order
to reach the condition LR (cid:28) LW L, where LR(W L) denotes
the kinetic inductance of the ring (weak-link) [14, 18, 19].
The magneto-electric characterization of the interferometers
was performed in a ﬁltered He3-He4 dilution refrigerator at
different temperatures ranging from 30 mK to 1.2 K. Voltage
and current were measured with standard room-temperature

5

preampliﬁers. A lock-in ampliﬁer was used to reduce noise in
the tunneling conductance measurements. Five ω-SQUIPTs
have been fully characterized, two of which were of A-type
and three of B-type.

Theoretical model. To model the ω-SQUIPT we con-
sider the 3-terminal T-shaped Josephson weak-link sketeched
in Fig.1b. It consists of three diffusive quasi-one dimensional
N arms with lengths Li (i = L,C,R), each of them connected
to a superconducting electrode Si with phase ϕi. In order to
determine the density of states in the N arms we introduce the
isotropic quasiclassical retarded Green functions ˆgi which are
2× 2 matrices in the Nambu space. These functions satisfy in
each of the N arms the Usadel equation [30]

∂x ( ˆgi∂x ˆgi) +

i(E + iδ )

Ei

[ ˆτ3, ˆgi] = 0 ,

(1)

where x is the dimensionless coordinate normalized in each
arm by the respective length Li, and Ei = D/L2
i is the Thou-
less energy of the i-th arm, ˆτ3 is the third Pauli matrix in the
Nambu space, and δ takes into account the inelastic scattering
in the N region. Equation (1) is complemented by the normal-
ization condition:

ˆg2
i = 1.

(2)

This condition allows to write the matrix Green function in
terms of an unit vector (cid:126)g such that ˆg = (cid:126)g.(cid:126)τ. Here (cid:126)τ =
( ˆτ1, ˆτ2, ˆτ3) is the vector of Pauli matrices in Nambu space, and
(cid:126)g = (cosϕ sinθ ,sinϕ sinθ ,cosθ ) (see the scheme shown in
Fig. 2f where the angles θ and ϕ are deﬁned, and Supplemen-
tary Information for further details).

To describe each S/N interfaces we use the Nazarov’s

is

the BCS Green’s

function
of the Si electrode, ˆ∆i = ∆eiϕi ˆτ3 is the superconducting order
parameter, ri = GNi/GBi is the ratio between the conductance
of each arm (GNi) and the barrier conductance, GBi = G0niτ,
where G0 is the quantum of conductance, and ni the number
of each SN interface conducting channels that we assume to
have the same transmissivity τ. Furthermore, we set ϕC = 0
and neglect the inductance of the superconducting loops so
that we can deﬁne the phase differences ϕL = 2πΦL/Φ0
and ϕR = −2πΦR/Φ0, where ΦL(R) is the total magnetic
ﬂux through the left (right) loop area, Φ0 = h/2e is the ﬂux
quantum, and e is the electron charge. At the crossing point
between the arms (x = 0) we impose the continuity of the
Green’s functions and the conservation of the matrix current
which translate into following conditions:
GNi gi∂xgi|x=0 = 0

Topological considerations for semiclassical proximized

nanostructures

In this section we deﬁne topological indices for supercon-
ducting states in nanostructures with a typical size largely ex-
ceeding the electron wavelength, which is certainly the case of
the present interferometers. In this case, the superconducting
state in each point r of the normal part of the structure is char-
acterized by a traceless 2×2 matrix Green function that gener-
ally depends on energy, ˆg(ε,r) and satisﬁes the condition [31]
ˆg2 = ˆ1 [cf. Eq. (2)]. At ε = 0, ˆg can be mapped on a unit vector
at a hemisphere [25], ˆg → (cid:126)g → (cosϕ sinθ ,sinϕ sinθ ,cosθ ),
ϕ,θ being the longitude and latitude, respectively, −π ≤ ϕ ≤
π, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 (see Fig. 2f). The states at the equator,
θ = π/2, are superconducting and gapped, like those in the
superconducting leads where ϕ equals to the phase of the su-
perconducting pairing potential ∆(r). The deviation of the
vector from the equator θ (r) (cid:54)= π/2 gives rise to ﬁnite den-
sity of states at zero energy (ε = 0). This density is given by
ν(r) = ν0 cosθ, where ν0 is the density of states in the normal
metal that corresponds to the North pole of the hemisphere
(θ = 0). The values of (cid:126)g at zero energy are determined by
boundary conditions set on the terminals of the nanostructure.
If all terminals are superconducting and are thus situated at the
equator, they pull (cid:126)g to the equator too, while no agent favors
the deviations towards the North pole. It is therefore natural
to have the proximity gap overall the structure, with no ap-
parent reason for a gapless state. We argue that the gapless
state in a proximity nanostructure and observed in our exper-
iment arises from topological reasons. As we discuss below,
one may ascribe topological indexes to the gapped states. The
phases differing in the indexes occupy different regions of the
parameter space. Owing to continuity, these regions must be
separated by the regions of the gapless phase.

One can deﬁne the topological numbers for gapped states
with well-deﬁned ϕ(r) in a way that goes back to the discov-
ery of the ﬂux quantization [32, 33] by integrating the gradient

The number n is an integer by construction. The deﬁnition can
be expanded if there are small discontinuities in ϕ(r), for in-
stance, at tunnel barriers in the nanostructure. In this case, one
adds to the integral the value of the phase jump projected on
(−π,π) interval as it is done in the description of Josephson
arrays [31, 34]. Within the normal-metal part of the structure
there are no phase singularities, and hence if the contour is
within the proximized structure the integral (6) vanishes.

For our device, we may deﬁne two topological numbers ex-
tending the contours over the left or right loops, as shown
in Fig. 5. There are two equivalent ways to incorporate the
phase jumps ϕL,−ϕR into these topological numbers. One
can project these phase differences on (−π,π) interval.
In
this case, the numbers are obviously periodic in ﬂuxes ΦL,R
in both loops. There is, however, an inconvenience: a num-
ber jumps by 1 any time the corresponding phase difference
passes π, while this jump does not signify any change in the
gapped superconducting state of the junction. It is therefore
more consistent to replace the phase differences with the ac-
tual values of the ﬂux in the loop,

In this way, the topological numbers do not jump within a
domain of a given gapped state. However, they are now obvi-
ously not periodic in ﬂux. We stick to the second deﬁnition.

If we consider an elementary cell

in ﬂux space
topology with (nL,nR) =
we ﬁnd 4 states of distinct
(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). They are topological protected in
the sense that lying at the equator these gapped conﬁgurations
of g(r) cannot be continuously transformed to one another.
The actual transition requires (cid:126)g(r) to deviate from the equator
and this results in a gapless state.

Let us illustrate this with exemplary nanostructure made of
three quasi-1dimensional wires connected to the correspond-

6). The three wires are represented by three distinct colors.

Performance as a magnetometer

We plot the values of (cid:126)g(r) across the wires on the top view
of the hemisphere. The corresponding curves start in respec-
tive terminals and join together in some point. For gapped
states, all curves lie at the equator. A qualitative difference
between the (0,0) and (0,1) states is the position of the olive
curve: it is on different sides of the equator. The continuous
transition between these two conﬁgurations require the olive
curve to go up in latitude while pulling the other curves. This
leads to a ﬁnite density of states in the weak-link.

Besides the exotic topologies accessible with multi-
terminal JJs it is also interesting to investigate the ﬂux sen-
sitivity of this novel double-loop geometry, and to compare it
to that of existing proximity-based state-of-the-art supercon-
ducting interferometers. A complete quantiﬁcation of the ﬂux
sensitivity for the two ω-SQUIPTs is reported Fig. 7 for both
current and voltage polarization. Figure 7a shows the current
and voltage drop measured in the A-type interferometer at dif-
ferent bias from which the to ﬂux-to-voltage (V) and ﬂux-to-
current (I) transfer functions are evaluated (see Fig. 7b,c). In
particular, the modulations reach peak-to-peak amplitudes as

SQUIPT interferometers measured at Tbath ∼ 30 mK. The symbol
d is used to identify the interelectrode distance between two super-

large as δ V(cid:39) 25 µV, and δ I(cid:39) 2 nA. Moreover, the transfer
functions obtain a maximum value up to |V|Max (cid:39) 63 µV/Φ0,
and |I|Max (cid:39) 5 nA/Φ0 at Φ (cid:39) Φ0/8, and show the expected
Φ0-periodicity. A similar characterization for the B-type ω-
SQUIPT is shown in Fig. 7d,e,f. In general, it turns out that
the performance of this interferometer are degraded as com-
pared to the A-type. Indeed, the B-type ω-SQUIPT reaches
only modulations up to δ V(cid:39) 5 µV, and δ I(cid:39) 0.5 nA, then
|V|Max (cid:39) 28 µV/Φ0 and |I|Max (cid:39) 2 nA/Φ0.

The best achieved performance of the ω-SQUIPTs are
compared in Table I with those obtained in previous two-
terminal SQUIPTs realized with a N [19] or a superconducting
probe [12, 18]. This comparison shows that the sensitivity of
the three-terminal interferometer, although no optimal, is bet-
ter than the sensitivity obtained in the ﬁrst generation of two-
terminal SQUIPTs [12], but it is somewhat lower than that of
an optimized SQUIPT interferometer [18] due to the smaller
size of the weak-link, and thanks to the use of a S probe.

The impact of bath temperature (Tbath) on the transfer func-
tions of both types of interferometers is displayed in Fig. 8.
In particular, both the ﬂux-to-voltage (panel a) and the ﬂux-
to-current (panel b) transfer functions monotonically decay by
increasing temperature, vanishing around ∼ 800mK.

Finally, it is worthwhile to mention that the double loop ge-
ometry of the ω-SQUIPT may offer interesting perspectives
if used as a ﬂux-gradiometer at the nanoscale, owing to the
strong dependence of the DoS in the weak-link on the differ-
ence between the two magnetic ﬂuxes, (ΦL − ΦR) [4].
