Considering the quantum dynamics of 2DEG exposed to both a stationary magnetic ﬁeld and
an intense high-frequency electromagnetic wave, we found that the wave decreases the scattering-
induced broadening of Landau levels. Therefore, various magnetoelectronic properties of two-
dimensional nanostructures (density of electronic states at Landau levels, magnetotransport, etc) are
sensitive to the irradiation by light. Thus, the elaborated theory paves a way to optical controlling
magnetic properties of 2DEG.

INTRODUCTION

The study of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
exposed to a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld is one
of the most excited areas in the modern physics of nanos-
tructures. The permanent interest to this topic origi-
nates from rich fundamental and applied capabilities of
two-dimensional electron systems (see, e.g., Refs. [1–3]).
Particularly, the magnetoelectronic properties of 2DEG
subjected to a microwave irradiation are actively stud-
ied during last years4–16. However, the most attention
on the subject was paid before to the simplest case of
weak electromagnetic ﬁeld which does not change elec-
tron states. Namely, the only eﬀect of the weak ﬁeld is
the ﬁeld-induced electron transitions between the unper-
turbed states. On the contrary, a strong electromagnetic
ﬁeld can substantially mix electron states. As a result
of this mixing, the composite electron-ﬁeld object “elec-
tron dressed by ﬁeld” (dressed electron) appears17,18.
The light-induced renormalization of physical properties
of dressed electrons has been studied in various atomic
systems17–19 and condensed-matter structures, including
bulk semiconductors20–22, quantum wells23–28, quantum
rings29,30, graphene31–38, etc.
In the present research,
we develop the theory describing the magnetic proper-
ties of dressed 2DEG and demonstrate that they can be
substantially modiﬁed by the dressing ﬁeld.

II. SCHR ¨ODINGER PROBLEM FOR LANDAU

LEVELS IN DRESSED 2DEG

Let us consider a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
conﬁned in the (x, y) plane, which is subjected to both
a stationary magnetic ﬁeld, B = (0, 0, B), directed along
the z axis and a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave
(dressing ﬁeld) propagating along the same axis z (see
Fig. 1). The Hamiltonian of 2DEG reads as

ˆHe =

1

2me

[ˆp − e (A0 + At)]2 ,

(1)

The paper is organized as follows. In the second sec-
tion, we solve the Schr¨odinger equation for a 2DEG sub-
jected to both a stationary magnetic ﬁeld and a high-
frequency dressing ﬁeld. In the third section, the found
solutions of the Schr¨odinger problem are used to ana-
lyze various magnetoelectronic characteristics of dressed
2DEG, including density of electron states and magne-
totransport. The last sections contain conclusions and
acknowledgments.

where me is the eﬀective electron mass, e is the electron
charge, A0 = (−By, 0, 0) is the stationary vector poten-
tial of the magnetic ﬁeld, At = (0, [E/ω] cos ωt, 0) is the
time-dependent vector potential of the electromagnetic
wave, E is the amplitude of electric ﬁeld of the wave, ω
is the wave frequency, and ˆp = (ˆpx, ˆpy, 0) is the opera-
tor of two-dimensional electron momentum, px,y. Solu-
tions of the nonstationary Schr¨odinger problem with the

Hamiltonian (1) should be sought in the form

bit along the y axis. Substituting the wave function (2)
into the Schr¨odinger equation with the Hamiltonian (1),

It should be noted that the ﬁeld-induced terms in the
wave functions (2)–(3) do not depend on the Landau
level number, N . This means that the dressing ﬁeld
does not change the structure of Landau levels. How-
ever, the dressing ﬁeld produces exponential phase shifts
in the wave functions (2)–(3). In the absence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld, similar phase shifts strongly eﬀect on trans-
port characteristics of dressed 2DEG via the renormal-
ization of electron scattering26,27. Since the phase shifts
in Eqs. (2)–(3) depend on both the dressing ﬁeld and
the magnetic ﬁeld, one can expect that magnetotransport
properties of 2DEG will be renormalized by the dressing
ﬁeld as well.
In order to describe this renormalization
accurately, we have to solve the scattering problem for
the dressed electron states (2)–(3).

Let an electron interact with scatterers in the presence
of the same ﬁelds, A0 and At. Then the wave function
of the electron, Ψ(r, t), satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation

2

where U (r) is the total scattering potential of 2DEG
arisen from macroscopically large number of scatterers.
Since the wave functions (2) form the complete basis at
any time t, one can seek solutions of the Schr¨odinger
equation (4) as an expansion

Ψ(r, t) =Xj

aj(t)ψj(r, t),

(5)

where the diﬀerent indices j correspond to the diﬀer-
ent sets of all quantum numbers (px and N ) describing
electron states of the considered system.
It should be
stressed that Eqs. (2)–(3) describe exact wave functions
of a dressed electron. Therefore, the using of the com-
plete basis (2) in the expansion (5) takes into account the
interaction between the electron and the dressing ﬁeld in
full, i.e. non-perturbatively. As to the electron transi-
tion from a state j to a state j ′ due to the potential
U (r), we will describe this scattering process within the
conventional perturbation theory.

Let an electron be in the state j at the time t = 0 and,
correspondingly, aj ′ (0) = δj ′,j. Substituting the expan-
sion (5) into the Schr¨odinger equation (4) and restricting
the accuracy by the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory
(the Born approximation), we can write the amplitude of
scattering to the state j ′ as

(10)

Physically, the terms with n 6= 0 in Eq. (10) describe
the electron scattering accompanied by the absorption
(emission) of n photons. In order to neglect these terms,
we will assume the dressing ﬁeld to be both nonresonant
and high-frequency. If the ﬁeld is nonresonant, its fre-
quency, ω, lies far from resonant (cyclotron) frequency,
ω0, corresponding to electron transitions between dif-
ferent Landau levels. Therefore, there are no photon-
assisted transitions between the electron states j and j ′
from diﬀerent Landau levels.
If the dressing ﬁeld fre-
quency, ω, is high enough, the condition Γ/ω < 1 is
satisﬁed, where Γ is the scatterer-induced broadening of
Landau levels. In this high-frequency case, there are no
photon-assisted transitions between the electron states j
and j ′ within the same Landau level. Following the con-
ventional terminology of quantum optics, the considered
nonresonant high-frequency ﬁeld should be treated as a
purely dressing (nonabsorbable) ﬁeld. As a consequence,
all terms with n 6= 0 in Eq. (10) vanish. Therefore, the
only eﬀect of the dressing ﬁeld on 2DEG is the renor-
malization of the probability of elastic electron scatter-
ing within the same Landau level (εj ′ = εj) which is
described by the term with n = 0 in Eq. (10):

ﬁeld. Just this factor is responsible for all eﬀects dis-
cussed below. Particularly, the lifetime of dressed elec-
tron at the Landau level, τ , is renormalized by the Bessel

In the context of the discussed problem, the parameter

write the delta function (14) as δ(εj ′ − εj) ≈ 1/(πΓ) and,

ence between the scattering probability of dressed elec-

tron (12) consists in the Bessel-function factor depending

III. MAGNETOELECTRONIC

CHARACTERISTICS OF DRESSED 2DEG

Since the scattering time (16) depends on the dress-
ing ﬁeld, the scattering-induced broadening of Landau

levels, Γ = /τ , is also aﬀected by the ﬁeld.
In order
to describe the broadening accurately, it is convenient to

(17)

where Γ(N ) = /τ is the broadening for the Landau level
with the number N = 0, 1, 2..., and Γ0 is the broaden-
ing of Landau levels in the absence of the dressing ﬁeld
(natural broadening). It should be noted that Eq. (17)
does not depend on the density of scatterers, ns, and
the strength of scatterers, U0. Therefore, Eq. (17) de-
scribes the dependence of the broadening of Landau lev-
els on the dressing ﬁeld in the most general form, where
the broadening of “bare” Landau levels, Γ0, should be
treated as a phenomenological parameter which can be
found from experiments. In the absence of the dressing
ﬁeld (E = 0), the broadening (17) is the same for all Lan-

dau levels, Γ = Γ0 ∝ √B, in complete agreement with

the conventional theory of magnetoelectronic properties
of 2DEG42,43. On the contrary, the dressing ﬁeld leads to
the diﬀerent broadening (17) for diﬀerent Landau levels
(see Fig. 2). As to the density of electron states, it is

(18)

where D0 = 1/(π2l2
0Γ0). Substituting the broadening
(17) into Eq. (18), one can calculate the density of states

4

in dressed 2DEG (see the insert in Fig. 2). Since the
dressing ﬁeld decreases the broadening of Landau levels
(17), this results in increasing the density of states at
Landau level energies, ε = εN . As a consequence, all
phenomena sensitive to the density of electronic states
(magnetotransport, magneto-optical eﬀects, etc) are af-
fected by the dressing ﬁeld. Particularly, the longitudinal
magnetoconductivity of 2DEG at the temperature T = 0
is described by the conventional expression42,43,

σxx ≈ σ0(cid:18)N +

1

2(cid:19)"1 −(cid:18) ε − εN

Γ(N ) (cid:19)2# ,

(19)

where σ0 = e2/π2 is the elementary conductivity, and N
is the number of Landau level at the Fermi energy. Sub-
stituting the broadening (17) into Eq. (19), one can cal-
culate the dependence of the conductivity on the dressing
ﬁeld. Experimentally, one can change the Fermi energy
of 2DEG, εF , with a gate voltage. Then we arrive from
Eq. (19) at the oscillating behavior of the conductivity
(the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations) plotted in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3: (Color online) The dependence of the longitudinal
conductivity, σxx, on the Fermi energy, εF , in a GaAs-based
quantum well at the magnetic ﬁeld B = 1.2 T, irradiation
frequency ω = 2 THz, and the natural broadening Γ0 = 1
meV. The solid line describes the conductivity of unirradiated
2DEG, whereas the dotted one corresponds to the conductiv-
ity at the irradiation intensity I = 600 W/cm2. The insert
shows the diﬀerence of these two conductivities, ∆σxx.

It should be stressed that there is the crucial dif-
ference between the considered high-frequency dressing
ﬁeld and the low-frequency case. Since 2DEG absorbs a
low-frequency ﬁeld, the multiphoton-assisted scattering
of electrons can increase the longitudinal conductivity7.
Particularly, this eﬀect was proposed to explain the phe-
nomenon of “zero resistance states” in 2DEG subjected
to both a magnetic ﬁeld and a low-frequency (microwave)
irradiation4,13. On the contrary, the considered high-
frequency ﬁeld cannot be absorbed by 2DEG. The only
eﬀect of the ﬁeld is the suppression of electron scattering,
which results in decreasing both the broadening of Lan-
dau levels and the longitudinal conductivity (see Figs. 2

and 3). Thus, a high-frequency irradiation and a low-
frequency one lead to diﬀerent behavior of the magneto-
electronic properties of 2DEG.

It should be noted also that the magnetoelectronic ef-
fects induced by a dressing ﬁeld strongly depends on the
kind of electron dispersion. In Dirac materials with linear
electron dispersion, a dressing ﬁeld changes the energy
distance between Landau levels and, therefore, modiﬁes
all phenomena depending on the cyclotron frequency38.
On the contrary, in the considered case of 2DEG with
the parabolic electron dispersion, a dressing ﬁeld does
not change the cyclotron frequency but inﬂuences on the
electron scattering within Landau levels.

As to experimental observability of the discussed phe-
nomena, all dressing eﬀects increase with increasing the
intensity of the dressing ﬁeld. However, an intense irra-
diation can ﬂuidize a semiconductor quantum well. To
avoid the ﬂuidizing, it is reasonable to use narrow pulses
of a strong dressing ﬁeld. This well-known methodol-
ogy has been elaborated long ago and commonly used
to observe various dressing eﬀects — particularly, mod-
iﬁcations of energy spectrum of dressed electrons arisen
from the optical Stark eﬀect — in semiconductor struc-
tures (see, e.g., Refs. 46–48). Within this approach, giant
dressing ﬁelds (up to GW/cm2) can be applied to semi-
conductor structures.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing the aforesaid, we can conclude that
a strong high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld (dressing

5

ﬁeld) decreases the electron scattering between diﬀer-
ent cyclotron orbits within the same Landau level. As
a consequence, the ﬁeld decreases the scattering-induced
broadening of Landau levels in 2DEG. This results in
the ﬁeld-induced modiﬁcation of various magnetoelec-
tronic properties depending on the density of electron
states (particularly, magnetotransport characteristics of
2DEG). Therefore, a dressing ﬁeld can be considered
as a perspective tool to manipulate the magnetoelec-
tronic properties of various two-dimensional nanostruc-
tures. Since such nanostructures serve as a basis for na-
noelectronic devices, the developed theory opens a way
for optical control of their magnetoelectronic character-
istics.
