1. Abstract

We have used the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe two transiting planetary systems

orbiting low mass stars discovered in the Kepler K2 mission. The system K2-3 (EPIC

201367065) hosts three planets while EPIC 202083828 (K2-26) hosts a single planet.

Observations of all four objects in these two systems conﬁrm and reﬁne the orbital and

physical parameters of the planets. The reﬁned orbital information and more precise planet

radii possible with Spitzer will be critical for future observations of these and other K2

targets. For K2-3b we ﬁnd marginally signiﬁcant evidence for a Transit Timing Variation

between the K2 and Spitzer epochs.

Introduction

2.1. Demographics and Properties of Planets Orbiting M Stars

One of the primary goals of the re-purposed Kepler spacecraft (the “K2 mission”) is

a wider survey of late type stars than was achieved within the primary Kepler mission

(Beichman et al. 2013; Howell et al. 2014). Population studies of the Kepler data suggest

an increased incidence of lower mass planets orbiting M stars (Howard et al. 2012).

Although Kepler observed only about 3000 M stars, initial results suggest a high incidence

of planets orbiting low mass stars, approaching 100% (Dressing & Charbonneau 2013,

2015), of which up to 25% may reside in the loosely deﬁned stellar Habitable Zone (HZ)

(Dressing & Charbonneau 2015). These eﬀects must be explained in the context of planet

formation theory (Payne & Lodato 2007; Mordasini et al. 2012) and make the validation of

these trends with a larger sample of great interest. By surveying a dozen or more ﬁelds,

each containing ∼4,000 late type stars, K2 promises to increase the sample of M star

planetary systems more than tenfold.

– 3 –

Planets orbiting M stars are important for reasons beyond their demographics. Because

cool stars have smaller radii than earlier spectral types, the transit signal of a given sized

planet is proportionately larger, resulting in easier follow-up spectroscopic observations

with the Hubble Space Telescope, HST (Knutson et al. 2014), and soon, the James Webb

Space Telescope, JWST (Beichman et al. 2014). While an Earth-analog (1 R⊕) orbiting a

solar type star in a 1 AU HZ produces a 84 parts per million (ppm) transit signal every

365 days, the same planet orbiting in the HZ of an M3 star produces a >500 ppm signal

every ∼30 days. Thus, JWST spectroscopy will be able to probe down to at least the

Super-Earth level (Batalha et al. 2014) for late type stars. Stellar brightness is another

critical parameter for transit spectroscopy. In this regard, K2 oﬀers an advantage over

Kepler by covering ∼10 times more sky so that with careful selection it will be possible to

target M stars that are 1-2 mag brighter than those in Kepler ’s primary ﬁeld. Eventually,

the TESS mission with its all-sky coverage will gain an average 3-5 mag in host star

brightness over Kepler (Ricker et al. 2014; Sullivan et al. 2015).

Numerous groups have proposed M star candidates for K2 and are engaged in follow-up

activities to identify, validate and characterize candidates found in the K2 light curves. In

this paper we introduce a follow-up eﬀort using the Spitzer Space Telescope to improve the

orbital ephemerides and other properties of K2 planets hosted by cool stars. We report

the results for two systems: K2-3, an M0 star with three planets (EPIC 201367065b,c,d;

Crossﬁeld et al. (2015)) and EPIC 202083828 (hereafter K2-26), an M1 star with a single

transiting planet (Schlieder et al 2015).

2.2. The Spitzer K2 Transit Program

A proposal to follow-up planets hosted by M stars by K2 using Spitzer observations at

4.5 µm (IRAC Channel 2) was approved in Cycle 11 (Werner, PI; Program 11026). Spitzer

observations will augment and complement K2 results in a number of important ways.

– 4 –

1. Kepler ’s 30 minute observing cadence means that the ingress and egress of a transit

or even the entire transit, which might be as short as 1 hr for a late M star, will have

only a handful of Kepler samples per event. For comparable signal-to-noise ratio

(SNR) on the transit depth, Spitzer transits provide much tighter constraints on the

orbital and system parameters because of the much ﬁner sampling (0.4-to-30 sec vs.

30 minutes for K2 ).

2. By observing a year or more after K2 ’s measurements, Spitzer in conjunction with

the original K2 results can dramatically improve the orbital ephemerides and thus

enable accurate predictions of transit timing many years into the future, which will

be particularly important for JWST observations. In the case of multiple systems,

Spitzer may reveal Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) which may be used to estimate

planetary masses.

3. M stars show strong limb darkening in the Kepler bandpass which complicates the

determination of the transit parameters and the planetary characteristics. Much less

limb darkening is present in the Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 um bands (Claret & Bloemen

2011). Thus the Spitzer measurements permit a much cleaner determination of the

transit parameters, particularly given the sampling issue discussed above.

4. To ﬁrst order, the depth of a transit should be achromatic. This lack of change

of transit depth with wavelength means that Spitzer results can be used to reject

certain false positive alternatives to the transit interpretation, e.g. a low mass stellar

companion, particularly in the absence of radial velocity observations. There are,

however, small wavelength dependent variations between the visible and infrared

which may be interpreted in terms of atmospheric structure, e.g. the presence of

– 5 –

molecular absorptions or a temperature inversion. Such claims are at the limits of

Spitzer ’s accuracy (Evans et al. 2015; Wong et al. 2015).

5. Two additional advantages of Spitzer , a lower level of photospheric noise (“stellar

jitter”) in the infrared compared with visible wavelengths, and the detection of

secondary eclipses for hot, short period planets, may eventually be demonstrated on

M stars still to be identiﬁed by K2 .

Taking the above considerations into account, Spitzer provides an important means of

screening M star exoplanets and identifying those most promising for JWST follow-up,

especially because IRAC spans the middle of JWST ’s spectroscopic wavelength range. The

results presented herein will demonstrate the value of Spitzer in all of these areas. The

approved Spitzer program will observe of order 30 transiting systems with over 450 hours of

telescope time with the goal of improving planetary and orbital properties for the brightest,

most promising targets for future spectroscopic follow-up.

2.3. The Need for Improved Ephemerides

A focus of this paper will be the importance of Spitzer observations to improve

signiﬁcantly the ability to recover future transits. At the simplest level, the ability to

predict the time of a future transit, T (n), depends on the uncertainty in the reference

time for an initial mid-transit time, σ(T0) and the uncertainty in the orbital period, σP ,

projected n orbits into the future:

and

T (n) = T0 + nP

σ(Tn) = pσ(T0)2 + (nσ(P ))2

(1)

(2)

– 6 –

Equation (2) shows that the uncertainty in the mid-transit time increases linearly

with orbit number after the reference orbit. Thus, for example, for the planet K2-3d

(see Table 1) K2 data alone yield T0 (BJD) =2456826.2233 ±0.0039 (2014 June 17) and

P = 44.5629 ± 0.0057. By the time JWST gets around to observing this object on, say,

BJD 2458817.609 (2019 Dec 14), 45 orbits after its initial observation by K2 , the 1 σ

uncertainty in the transit mid-point would be ∼6 hours. Such a large uncertainty would

increase the duration required for a JWST observation by ∼12 hours (from -1σ to +1σ)

relative to a short 4 hr transit to be sure of capturing the entire transit at even the 1 σ

level. As we demonstrate in this paper, the addition of even a single Spitzer observation

can reduce this uncertainty by a factor of 5-10.

3. Observed Targets

The ﬁrst two objects we observed with Spitzer came from early discoveries from K2 in

Fields 0 and 11.

The multiple system K2-3 (EPIC 201367065) has three planets orbiting an M0 star

(Crossﬁeld et al. 2015) as described in Table 1. The three planets (b,c,d) have radii in the

range of 1.2-2.4 R⊕ and were observed by K2 with 8,4 and 2 transits, respectively. The star

is bright in near-IR wavelengths (Ks = 8.56 mag, Skrutskie et al. (2006); WISE [4.6]= 8.42

mag, Wright et al. (2010)) with a radius of 0.56±0.068 R⊕ making it a promising target for

JWST follow-up which requires bright targets for high SNR spectroscopy. The outermost

planet, K2-3d, is in the nominal Habitable Zone with an insolation of 1.5 ± 0.5 times our

Earth’s and an eﬀective temperature around 300 K (Crossﬁeld et al. 2015).

Examination of the sources in the Campaign 0 ﬁeld led to the identiﬁcation of a 2.7

– 7 –

R⊕ planet with an eﬀective temperature of < 500K orbiting the M1 star K2-26 (Ks = 10.53

mag; WISE [4.6]= 10.35 mag) on a 14.5 day period. As described in Schlieder et al

(2015) the host star is an M1.0±0.5 dwarf with near-solar metallicity, [Fe/H]=−0.13 ± 0.15

and a stellar radius of 0.52 ± 0.08 R⊙. Schlieder et al (2015) argue that from the

examination of HIRES spectroscopy, which rules out spectroscopic binaries earlier than

M4.5V, LBT/LMIRcam and Robo-AO adaptive optics imaging, and archival survey images

spanning more than 50 years, that the likelihood of this planet candidate being a false

positive due to an eclipsing binary or hierarchical multiple system is extremely small. Thus

we included this object in our Spitzer program.

4. Spitzer Data and Analysis

In March 2015 K2-3b was observed by Spitzer on two epochs while planets ‘c’ and

‘d’ were observed once each. All three were observed one more time each approximately

6 months later in Sept. 2015 (Table 2). K2-26b was observed once in March 2015. The

science observations were timed to begin 2 hours before the start of the transit and end

two hours after the end of the transit to allow adequate baseline on either side of the event.

We preceded the main observation with a 30-min pre-observation of the target to mitigate

the eﬀect of large drifts across the pixel due to temperature changes in the spacecraft after

large slews from the preceding observations (Grillmair et al. 2012).

All observations were obtained with Spitzer IRAC Channel 2 (4.5 µm; Fazio et al.

(2004); Werner et al. (2004)) using staring mode observations. We choose Ch2 because the

dominant instrumental systematic of changing gain as a function of position is a smaller

eﬀect in Ch2 than Ch1 (Ingalls et al. 2012); the diminished eﬀect of limb-darkening in

Ch2 is also advantageous. Staring mode is standard practice for exoplanet observations

in order to keep the star on one position within a single pixel. To ensure that the most

– 8 –

well-calibrated position with minimal gain variation is achieved on the pixel, a peak-up star

was used to place the target star (corrected for proper motion, Table 1) on the “sweet spot”

of the central pixel. Exposure times were chosen to maintain the well depth in the linear

regime of the detector. K2-3 was observed in sub-array mode with 2s frame times and

K2-26b was observed with 12s exposures in full array mode. The same “sweet spot” was

used for both stars. This observing strategy resulted in over 53,928 individual photometry

points used in the analysis described below.

4.1. Photometric Analysis

Centroiding and aperture photometry were performed using the Python package

photutils. Aperture photometry was computed for each exposure using radii ranging from

2.0 to 2.9 pixels in 0.1 pixel increments, as well as 3.0 to 5.0 pixels in 0.5 pixel increments.

Optimal photometric radii were determined for each dataset by choosing the time series with

minimal scatter, thus minimizing the contribution from background noise while including

enough of stellar ﬂux to maximize SNR. The typical radii values used were 2.2 or 2.3

pixels, which is consistent with independent analysis of optimal Spitzer transit photometry

(Krick et al. 2015). Sky background levels and photometric uncertainties were computed

taking into account known characteristics of the detector. Because of the small size (32 × 32

pixels) of sub-array images, this estimate entails a trade-oﬀ between good number statistics

and contamination from the stellar PSF. We approached this by ﬁtting a Gaussian to each

frame after masking pixels within the central PSF and central 2 rows and columns, as well

as the top row, which is systematically biased to lower values (see Knutson et al.

(2012)

for more detailed discussion).

– 9 –

4.2. Spitzer Systematics

The largest systematic in Spitzer photometry arises from intrapixel gain variations.

Spacecraft-induced motion coupled with an under sampled PSF lead to measured ﬂux

variations of order a few percent (Ingalls et al. 2012). The spacecraft motions are of several

types: variable-duration thermal settling of the spacecraft, pointing control errors resulting

in long-term drift, a 39 minute sawtooth pointing oscillation due to the cycling of a battery

heater in the spacecraft bus, as well as both high and low frequency jitter due to a variety

of possible causes, including harmonic coupling of the reaction wheel assembly to the

spacecraft structure (Grillmair et al. 2012).

We used the pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) method technique (Deming et al. 2015)

to reduce these systematic photometric variations. Similar to Deming et al. (2015), we ﬁt

the PLD pixel coeﬃcients simultaneously with a temporal systematic model. We opt for a

linear (instead of quadratic) ramp in time because the data do not obviously warrant the

increase in model complexity, and a quadratic ramp is more likely to be degenerate with

the transit signal. Thus the total deviation in signal at time t is modeled as:

∆St =

N

X

i=1

ci ˆP t

i + T (t) + mt + b

(3)

where the ci are the coeﬃcients that represent the partial derivatives from the Taylor

expansion described by Deming et al. (2015), T (t) is the transit signal, and m and b are the

coeﬃcients of the linear ramp in time. ˆP t

i is the ith pixel value of the normalized pixel grid

at time t:

ˆP t

– 10 –

We tried using both a 3 × 3 and a 5 × 5 pixel grid centered on the target, and we found

that while a 3 × 3 grid produced good results, a 5 × 5 grid further reduced the residual RMS

at minimal computational cost. We took an iterative approach to ﬁtting the systematic

coeﬃcients which allows for a gradual reﬁnement due to intermediate improvements in the

estimate of the non-systematic signal, i.e. the transit. We ﬁt the systematic coeﬃcients

while the transit parameters are held ﬁxed, then ﬁt for the transit parameters while the

systematic coeﬃcients are held ﬁxed, and repeat until a convergence criterion is met. At

each iteration the parameters are updated with their new maximum likelihood estimate

(MLE) values using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and a Gaussian likelihood.

Because the transit depths of these planets are in some cases (K2-3d) approaching

the limit of Spitzer ’s precision, simultaneous ﬁtting of the systematic and astrophysical

parameters can lead to the non-convergence of a wide variety of numerical optimization

algorithms. Initial testing showed that a modest improvement in the estimate of the

systematic component prior to ﬁtting any transit parameters prevented this, which led to

the development of the iterative approach described above. This is perhaps due to operating

near the limit of the instrument capability, combined with degeneracies between transit

and systematic parameters which complicate the objective function. For example, tests

conducted with higher SNR Spitzer transit data in which the amplitude of the systematic

signals is smaller compared to the transit signaltransit depth do not exhibit the same

diﬃculty. However, this eﬀect is mitigated by operating on un–binned data, and the transit

parameter estimates derived from the K2 data are of suﬃcient quality.

4.3. Transit Fitting and Derived Parameters

In the context of the above discussion, one possible drawback of this iterative method

in lower SNR datasets is an increased reliance on good starting guesses for the transit

– 11 –

parameters, as these are held ﬁxed while the initial PLD coeﬃcients are ﬁt. Although

variation of bin size typically resulted in a tight range of ﬁtted transit parameters, in

some cases larger bin sizes resulted in increased sensitivity to initial parameter estimates.

Testing with un-binned data showed that the sensitivity to initial parameter estimates is

typically about two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties derived from the

ﬁnal posteriors. Thus, in order to be more robust to uncertainties in the initial transit

parameters, and because of the relatively low computational complexity of PLD, we

analyzed the data without binning. Furthermore, although we typically detect no signiﬁcant

correlated noise (at 95% conﬁdence) after PLD, even low levels of residual correlation

could induce biases in ﬁts to the binned data. The iterative approach described above

typically adds only minor additional complexity, so the bulk of the total computation cost

is expended during the sampling of transit parameter posterior distributions.

For transit parameter estimates and uncertainties, we use the open-source emcee

package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), an eﬃcient Python implementation of the aﬃne-

invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler (Goodman & Weare

2010). To ﬁt the PLD-corrected data produced by the iterative method described above, we

use the open-source PyTransit code (Parviainen 2015) to generate the transit model. For

the planets of K2-3 we take a conservative approach to ﬁtting the astrophysical parameters

by using wide ﬂat priors on the mid-transit time, scaled semi-major axis, inclination, and

planet to star radius ratio. This produced fairly Gaussian posteriors for all parameters

except the scaled semi-major axis, which has a distinctly skewed posterior due to degeneracy

with the inclination parameter. For K2-26b we use Gaussian priors set by the values

reported by (Schlieder et al 2015), because the egress of the transit in the Spitzer data

was too close to being missed to ensure good ﬁts using ﬂat priors. We ensured that the

MCMC chains produced by the sampler were of suﬃcient quality by monitoring both the

auto-correlation time and the acceptance fraction, as well as by visual inspection of the

– 12 –

chains and corner plots of the posteriors.

The results of the correction of the Spitzer photometry to reveal the transit signals are

shown in Figure 1. The derived system parameters are given in Table 3.

5. Results and Discussion

5.1. Comparison of K2 and Spitzer Parameters

The fundamental transit parameters of period and depth are consistent between the

K2 and Spitzer datasets. Consider the case of K2-3b for which the Spitzer data alone

yield a period of 10.054440±0.0000053 days which can be compared with the K2 -only

value of 10.05402±0.00026 d (Crossﬁeld et al. 2015) which diﬀer from one another by 1.6

σ. By combining the individual K2 and Spitzer transit times simultaneously, we obtain a

new, more accurate period (Crossﬁeld et al. (2015) and Table 3) of 10.0545435±0.000029 d

(Table 4) which diﬀers from the K2 -only value by 2σ. We discuss the apparent diﬀerence

between the two estimates below in a discussion of possible Transit Timing Variations § 5.2.

In Table 4 and Figure 2 we present combined period estimates which represent a 5- to

10-fold improvement due to the longer temporal baseline in the combined datasets. Using

these new values and assuming no TTVs we can project the ephemerides of K2-3b,c,d

into the JWST era (circa 2019 Dec) to be less uncertain than 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40 hr,

respectively, compared with K2 -only uncertainties of 1.3, 2.5 and 6 hr. These results show

the importance of Spitzer observations in greatly reducing the uncertainties in transit times

for future observations.

The other parameter of primary importance is the depth of the transit, or the derived

parameters Rp/R∗ and Rp/R⊕. These are very similar between the K2 -only and K2 -Spitzer

values for all four planets. As shown in Tables 1 and 3, the diﬀerences in the transit depths

– 13 –

are within 1 σ with reﬁned values given in Table 5. In the case of K2-26b it is important to

note that the close similarity in transit depth provides further conﬁdence in the planetary

nature of the transiting source. False positives due to an eclipsing binary or hierarchical

system would have a markedly diﬀerent eclipse depth in the Spitzer band (D´esert et al.

2015).

5.2. Transit timing

Deviations from the transit times predicted by a constant period (Keplerian) orbit can

be indicative of mutual gravitational interactions between planets. TTVs have proven to be

an important method of validating Kepler planets and measuring dynamical masses (e.g.

Steﬀen et al. 2013 and Carter et al. 2012).

With the longer baseline allowed by Spitzer , we examined the central transit times

for the K2-3 system to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of any transit timing variations.

In addition to measuring the transit times of the transits observed with Spitzer (Table 6),

we obtained K2 lightcurves for all of the individual K2-3 transit events (Crossﬁeld et al.

2015) which allows us to ﬁt individual transit times (Table 6) for the planets of K2-3 in the

original K2 observing campaign. Note, however, that for any individual K2 transit there

are only a handful of individual data points with which to ﬁt each transit, with the result

that the individual timing uncertainties are large, e.g. ±2.5 minutes.

While the K2 transit times for K2-3b alone are consistent with a constant period model

(which is in turn consistent with the mean ephemeris reported by Crossﬁeld et al. 2015), the

combined Spitzer and K2 dataset show some evidence of TTVs. When all 11 data points

are considered the deviation from a constant period model is statistically signiﬁcant with

a χ2 of 23 for 9 degrees of freedom. Visual inspection of the individual K2 transit times of

– 14 –

K2-3b suggest a coherent variation of ∼ ±5 minutes relative to the mean period estimated

from the combined dataset (shown in red, right upper panel of Figure 3). However, the

major contributor to the χ2 is the Spitzer data which suggest the existence of a TTV

with an amplitude around 2±1 minute. The individual transit times for the combined K2

+Spitzer data for the outer two planets are consistent with constant period orbits (shown

in red, lower two panels on right Figure 3) with χ2 = 3.4 and 1.4 with 4 and 2 degrees of

freedom, respectively.

We consider brieﬂy the amplitude of the TTVs one might expect for the K2-3 system

in one representative conﬁguration with very nearly circular orbits, a mass for K2-3b of

∼ 8M⊕ (Almenara et al. 2015), and masses of 5M⊕ for the outer two planets (based roughly

on the mass-radius relationship in Weiss & Marcy (2014)). Illustrative TTVs for ‘b’ and

the outer two planets in this conﬁguration calculated using the code TTVFast (Deck et al.

2014) are shown in Figure 3. The right panel of the ﬁgure shows how this model (in black)

compares with the observed TTVs (in red). This model does not represent a ﬁt to the data,

it merely demonstrates a realistic possibility for the TTVs.

While the observed transit times of ‘c’ and ‘d’ are consistent in amplitude with those

predicted by the simple model, the statistically signiﬁcant ∼ 2 minute deviations observed

for K2-3b in the Spitzer data are not. The very low amplitude of the model TTVs of ‘b’ are

due to the low masses of the perturbing planets, the wide separation between the ‘b’ and

the other planets, and the lack of proximity to low order mean motion resonance.

To increase the amplitude to match the observations, our only truly unconstrained

parameters are eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter, because the mass of ‘c’ cannot be

much larger than our estimated 5M⊕ (a mass of ∼ 6.5M⊕ results if the planet density was

equal to that of iron). Larger amplitude TTVs therefore require the orbits of ‘b’ and ‘c’ to

be eccentric. However, since planet ‘c’ interacts much more strongly with planet ‘d’ than it

– 15 –

does with ‘b’, because the semi-major axis ratio is smaller between this pair compared with

the (b,c) pair, this scenario would predict larger TTVs for ‘c’ and ‘d’ compared with those

of ‘b’.

In summary, we ﬁnd tantalizing evidence for TTVs for K2-3b between K2 and Spitzer

epochs. The TTV amplitudes predicted for a conﬁguration with nearly circular orbits

and realistic masses is low enough to be consistent with a null detection of TTVs. More

observations are required to assess whether TTVs of a few minutes seen in the combined K2

plus and Spitzer data for planet ‘b’, which are marginally signiﬁcant (∼ 2σ) at this stage,

are in fact reﬂective of stronger dynamical interactions.

Schlieder et al

(2015) note the possibility that K2-26b might have a non-zero

eccentricity based on its transit duration (ǫ > 0.14 2σ) The nonzero eccentricity, if real, may

indicate past or present interactions with a perturbing body. With the current data, we

ﬁnd that the observed transit times do not show TTVs at any signiﬁcance. However, this

does not necessarily rule out a nearby perturbing planet, since the amplitude, timescale,

and phase of a TTV signal depends on many unknown parameters.

5.3. Prospects for JWST observing

The importance of objects like K2-3 with its system of 3 planets is driven by the desire

to carry out spectroscopic observations with JWST of planets in the size range of 1-2 R⊕.

Such observations are possible for planets orbiting bright, late-type stars which yield a deep

transit along with copious stellar photons to yield high(er) SNR spectroscopy. Along with

GJ1214b, Kepler 138bcd and the newly discovered GJ1132b (Berta-Thompson et al. 2015),

K2-3 represents a planetary system well suited for early JWST spectroscopy follow-up, at

least until TESS targets become available. K2-3’s planets have 1-2 R⊕, transit depths >100

– 16 –

ppm and a host stellar magnitude [4.6 µm]≤ 8.4 mag. Indeed, K2-3 is almost a magnitude

brighter than Kepler-138 (WISE [4.6 µm]< 9.4 mag). Situated in the Habitable Zone,

K2-3d will allow study of a temperate (∼ 300 K) mini-Neptune or Super-Earth sized planet.

We developed thermochemical equilibrium models and simulated JWST observations

of the transmission spectra of several possible atmospheres for K2-3b and clear solar

composition atmospheres of K2-3c and K2-3d using the techniques employed by Greene et al.

(2016). Clear solar composition, cloudy solar, and 100% H2O atmospheres were generated

for K2-3b, and we used the CHIMERA forward model (Line et al. 2013a; Line & Yung

2013b) and (Kreidberg et al. 2014a,b) to generate the transit transmission spectra for all

planetary atmospheres over 1 − 11µm. We simulated JWST NIRISS SOSS (1 − 2.5µm),

NIRCam grism (2.5 − 5.0µm), and MIRI LRS (5.0 − 11µm) transmission spectra of the three

planets in the K2-3 system using the techniques described in Greene et al. (2016). The

resultant spectra include photon, background, detector, and systematic noise components.

They were binned to spectral resolving power R=35 and are shown in Figure 4. Noise levels

were set by a combination of photon noise and a ﬂoor set by residual detector artifacts.

We adopted 18 ppm noise ﬂoors for NIRISS and NIRCam and 30 ppm for MIRI’s longer

wavelength detectors (Beichman et al. 2014). The single transit measurement for K2-3b has

a total noise level between around 23-30 ppm at wavelengths less than 4 µm. The K2-3c

and 3d simulations are for 5 transits, so that the noise ﬂoor dominates with total noise 19 -

25 ppm from 1 - 5 µm before jumping up to 34 - 44 ppm at MIRI wavelengths.

Figure 4 shows that JWST should detect strong H2O (e.g., 1.4 µm) and the strong

2.3, 3.4, 7.7 µm CH4 molecular features in the clear solar atmosphere models. Combining

the information in a complete 1 - 11 µm spectrum (observed in 3 or 4 transits total) of

K2-3b would allow distinguishing between clear solar and cloudy or high mean molecular

weight (e.g., pure H2O) atmospheres for that planet. More than 1 transit may need to be

– 17 –

observed at each wavelength in order to measure the mixing ratios of detected molecules

with moderate precision (better than 1 dex) if K2-3b does not have a totally clear solar

composition atmosphere. Spectra from several transits will need to be co-added to detect

these features individually in clear solar atmospheres for K2-3c and K2-3d.

6. Conclusions

We have used the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe transits of the three planets

orbiting the M0 star EPIC201367065 (K2-3b,c,d) and one planet orbiting the M star EPIC

202083828 (K2-26). The results allow us to reﬁne the parameters of these planetary systems

and greatly improve the precision of the ephemerides in support of future observations,

notably with JWST for spectroscopic follow-up. The observations have reduced the

uncertainties in predicted transits of K2-3 planets from 4-6 hours down to less than 1

hour. For K2-26b, the observations provide strong support for the exoplanet nature of the

transiting object by eliminating a number of false positives.

Predicted spectra for the K2-3 planets suggest that K2 will provide JWST with

planets straddling the super-Earth to mini-Neptune classes suitable for spectroscopic

characterization early in JWST’s mission.

These observations represent just the initial results of a larger Spitzer program which

will improve the ephemerides, search for Transit Timing Variations, and in some favorable

cases, provide observations of secondary eclipses.

Fig. 3.— top) Predicted TTVs for the three planets orbiting K2-3 based on an illustrative model

assuming circular orbits and nominal masses. The predicted TTVs for K2-3b are only a fraction

of a minute, much smaller than the observed deviations. Deviations for the outer planets could be

as large as 5-10 minutes, but are not constrained by these data. bottom) The same models but with

the data overplotted on an expanded scale.

Fig. 4.— Top: Model and simulated JWST NIRISS SOSS, NIRCam grism, and MIRI

LRS transmission spectra of K2-3b, adapted from ?.Model atmospheres binned to R=35 are

shown as continuous curves, and the simulated data points (diamonds) were drawn from a

Gaussian noise distribution for a single 2.3 hr transit plus an equal amount of time on the

star at each wavelength. Photon noise and a systematic noise ﬂoor of 18 ppm (1 ≤ λ ≤ 5

µm; NIRISS and NIRCam) or 30 ppm (λ > 5 µm) were included in the total noise estimate.

Bottom: Similar models for the planets K2-3c and d with data co-added for 5 transits at

each wavelength. In both cases, a complete spectrum of the entire 1 − 11 µm wavelength

region will require observations of 3 or 4 transits with diﬀerent instrument modes to obtain

1 transit at each wavelength. Strong features of H2O, CH4, and a clear continuum region

are indicated.
