NC plane waves, Casimir eﬀect and ﬂux tube

potential with L¨uscher terms

Abstract

We analyze plane waves in a model of quantum mechanics in a three
dimensional noncommutative (NC) space R3
λ. Signature features of NC
models are impossibility of probing distances smaller than a certain length
scale λ and a presence of natural energetic cut-oﬀ at energy scale of order
λ−2 (in convenient units). We analyze consequences of such restrictions
on a 1 dimensional Casimir eﬀect. The result shows resemblance to ﬂux
tube potential for q ¯q pairs and to eﬀective bosonic string theories with
L¨usher terms. Such behavior might eﬀect the radius of possible compact
(fuzzy) dimensions.

1 Introduction

NC models are believed to play an important role in a theory merging
quantum theory with gravity. If we tried to probe distances of the order of
Planck length the probing particle (for example a photon) would be hidden
under its event horizon, a black hole would be formed and no information
would be obtained. Because of this we expect theory of quantum gravity to
have a nontrivial commutator of the position operators [x, x] 6= 0 which
would forbid an exact position measurements. By removing arbitrarily
small distances we also remove arbitrarily large energies and the theory
obtains a natural energy cut-oﬀ.

This should be by no means a complete construction of quantum me-
chanics in noncommutative space (NC QM), quite the opposite, we will
try to be as brief as possible. For a detailed construction we refer the
reader to [8, 9, 10, 11] where the current model was developed and used
to analyze many diﬀerent problems.

The noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a relation

[xi, xj] = 2i λ εijk xk ,

(1)

Such NC coordinates can be realized with two sets of auxiliary bosonic
operators (lacking any physical interpretation so far) satisfying

[aα, a†

β] = δαβ,

[aα, aβ] = [a†

α, a†

β] = 0 ; α, β = 1, 2 ,

that act in an auxiliary Fock space F spanned on normalized vectors

|n1, n2i =

2)n2
√n1! n2!

|0i .

The NC coordinates are deﬁned using Pauli matrices as

xj = λ a+ σj a ≡ λ σj

The Hilbert space H consist of states of form

and is equipped with a (trace) norm

kΨk2 = 4π λ3 Tr[Ψ† (N + 1) Ψ] = 4π λ2 Tr[Ψ† r Ψ] ,

(6)

which in the commutative limit (λ → 0) reproduces the ordinary integral
norm (the factor 4πλ2r is chosen to ensure that).
For what follows it is suﬃcient to know following operators on H: the

coordinate operator, the free Hamiltonian and the velocity operator

(7)

As has been showed in [9], these operators mirror the behavior of
corresponding operators in ordinary QM up to a possible λ dependent
corrections. We call ˆVi a velocity operator, since our space lacks the trans-
lational invariance, but in variety of cases it is equal to the momentum
operator (with m = 1) and the gradient operator (up to normalization).
In the same reference it has been showed that

λ − λ ˆH0(cid:19)2

which demonstrates the free energy cut-oﬀ E ∈ h0, 2λ−2i. We deﬁne

for which it holds that

This is perhaps all we have to be (light)equipped with to search for

NC plane waves.

2 NC plane waves and the Casimir eﬀect

NC plane waves: In the ordinary QM mechanics planewaves satisfy
∂iΨk ∝ kiΨk where ki are constant. This can be easily transferred to NC
QM as
(11)

ˆViΨν = νiΨν ,

without a loss of generality we can set ν1 = ν2 = 0, ν3 = ν. The remain-
ing equation ˆV3Ψν = ν3Ψν can be solved ’from the scratch’ by methods
developed in [11]. However, solving equations can be simpliﬁed by an
educated guess and it is not very hard to make one here, we will seek
the solution of the form eiqx3 (note there is a diﬀerent constant in the

exponent as in (11)). Since x3 = λ(cid:0)a+

1 a1 − a+

2 a2(cid:1) we can get use of the

fact following from (2) that (using notation N1 = a+

The eigenvalue is λ−1 sin (λq) instead of just q (they are equal in the

λ → 0 limit). By the same steps it can be shown that

(13)

and (10) follows directly.

In the region where qλ ≪ 1 the spectrum is nearly identical to the
ordinary case, it diﬀers considerably for qλ ≈ 1. The maximal value is
obtained for q = π
2λ .
1 dimensional Casimir eﬀect: The minimum energy of a quantum
oscillator is 1
ω and the ground state of a system has the total energy
2
equal to sum of all zero mode frequencies. The result depends on the
geometry of the system (both shape and size) and therefore a force is
exerted on it. Such force is called Casimir and has been measured for
example between parallel metallic surfaces [7]. A thorough review of this
eﬀect can be found for example in [6]. The most simple problem to inves-
tigate consequences of (12) is perhaps a Casimir eﬀect in 1 dimension. In
the commutative case, using zeta-regularization (and ζ(−1) = − 1
12 ), one
obtains after summing over all zero modes (and 2 polarizations) of EM
ﬁelds on a line segment (of length L) with possible frequencies qn = nπ

ﬁelds as well)

We shall now study how does replacing the ordinary frequencies with
NC ones q → λ−1 sin (λq) amends this result. After summing over all
possible frequencies 1 (without taking outside ﬁelds into account)

12 (as can be seen by taking λ → 0 in (16)).

Let us make several comments here. To begin with an obvious one –
the result is ﬁnite and in the λ → 0 limit reproduces (14) (the singular
part gets canceled by outside ﬁelds). (16) provides a good interpretation
of the enigmatic result 1 + 2 + 3 + ... = − 1
12 . It should be looked at as
1 + 2 + 3 + ... = ∞ − 1
There are two possible scenarios to be distinguished: either the ﬁelds
exist only on the line (for example if the space is compact and the line
is all there is, or the ﬁelds are suppressed elsewhere), or also outside (for
example 1 dimensional analogue of the case of parallel conductive plates).
If energy of the outside ﬁelds is taken into account, then the linear term
gets canceled.
In such case the system consists of three line segments
h−Λ, ai, ha, bi, hb, Λi, where in the end we take Λ → ∞. The contri-
bution from linear terms is (cid:0)πλ2(cid:1)−1 ((a − (−Λ)) + (b − a) + (Λ − b)) =
(cid:0)πλ2(cid:1)−1 2Λ which is a inﬁnity independent of a, b in the considered limit.

Only other contribution from the outside ﬁelds is again an inﬁnite con-
stant 1

2λ , since all other terms vanish as some power of Λ−1.

If the linear term persists it becomes dominant in L ≫ λ region and
leads to a conﬁnement(-like behavior). This term is proportional λ−2,
which corresponds to the scale of the energetic cut-oﬀ (perhaps the Planck
energy). The constant term generates the L independent inﬁnity which
was taken care of by the zeta-regularization in (14). All other terms are

of the form − λ2i

L2i+1 with i = 0, 1, 2, ....

The energy reaches its minumum for πλ

2L = π, however this value prob-
ably cannot be achieved, in this region is the sum (15) ill-deﬁnied (the
upper boundary is 1/4. The largest achievable frequency is equal to λ−1
and therefore the shortest possible wavelength is Λmin = 2πλ. Below
L = 1
2 Λmin = πλ there cannot be squeezed even the shortest possible
wavelength. The attractive force vanishes at the length scale L ≈ λ.

3 Conclusion

We have derived the form of NC QM plane waves, whose spectrum strongly
diﬀers from that of ordinary theory, what corresponds to natural energetic
cut-oﬀ and a maximal obtainable frequency. This aﬀects many physical
problems, we have chosen the Casimir eﬀect to demonstrate it.

The linear terms (if it prevails) leads to a conﬁnement like behavior.
In the case of compact extra dimensions this should lead to shrinking of
the radius to R ≈ λ, where signiﬁcance of other (Casimir) terms grows as
well. Similar behavior appears in q ¯q pairs where color screening creates
a ﬂux tube with a linear potential on a line. In this case λ−1 should be
connected to a mass scale of the theory.

There has been analyzed a possible connection between q ¯q ﬂux tubes
and (eﬀective) string theories. Simulations and calculations suggest that
the linear (conﬁnement) term should be supplemented by an additional
terms, ﬁrst of which is proportional to L−1 (where L is now the string
length). Let us quote the results of L¨usher et al. in [1]

E(L) = T L + C −

γ
L

+ ...

(17)

T is the string length (which is related to the Planck’s scale), C is an
arbitrary mass factor (it is sometimes referred to as the regulazation term)
and γ = π
12 . This seems to be in an exact agreement with (16). In [2] it
has been argued that no L−2 term should appear, which again agrees with

4

(16), but that next term should be − π3λ2
288L3 , where the numerical factor of
1
288 followed from opened-closed string duality condition and diﬀers from
(16). Modeling conﬁnement as a Casimir eﬀect appear for example in [4],
where L−1 proportional correction appeared to a linear potential.

The current model of NC QM lead to exact results (and not only
perturbative) in many cases before, see [8, 9, 10], mainly because it does
not spoil most of symmetries of ordinary QM. Yet, being able to sum over
possible frequencies was not guaranteed.

It shall be interesting to study 3 dimensional Casimir eﬀect in a NC
space, possibly with diﬀerent geometrical shapes (cube, cylinder or a
sphere). The presented work ﬁrstly focused on the one dimensional case
only for its simplicity, but the results displayed similarities to diﬀerent
physical phenomena and should hold in general, possibly in a diﬀerent
form.
