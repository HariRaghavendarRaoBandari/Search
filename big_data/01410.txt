ABSTRACT

We present new observations of the cataclysmic variable V523 Lyr, a member of the open cluster NGC 6791. The Kepler Space
telescope obtained photometric observations of this source and we examine the nearly 3 year long light curve. The observations show
numerous small amplitude outbursts recurring on average every 33 days, intermittent quasi-periodic oscillations, and a signiﬁcant
fully coherent period of ∼3.8 hr which we identify as the orbital period of the binary. Contemporaneous optical spectroscopy of
V523 Lyr reveals a faint blue source with broad Balmer absorption lines containing narrow emission cores. Hα is in emission above
the continuum. The low amplitude of the photometric signal and no detected velocity motion suggest a low orbital inclination. We
discuss the properties of V523 Lyr and show that it is a member of the growing group of anomalous Z Cam type CVs, systems which
show stunted outbursts, light curve standstills, and occasional deep drops in brightness.

1. Introduction

The original Kepler mission was dedicated to the search and dis-
covery of extra-solar planets via transit detection and particu-
larly focused on determining the frequency of earth-size planets
orbiting solar-type stars (Borucki et al. 2010). However, through
its Guest Observer program, Kepler also targeted a number of
other objects including variables stars such as cataclysmic vari-
ables (CVs). These objects are interacting binary systems in
which a white dwarf (WD) accretes matter from a low-mass
main sequence companion, either through magnetically con-
trolled accretion (magnetic CV) or through the formation of an
accretion disk surrounding the WD. Kepler’s high photometric
precision and prolonged light curve observations of CVs are
proving invaluable in the understanding of their variability phe-
nomena, in particular the outbursts produced by disk instabilities
and semi-periodic variations (e.g. Wood et al. 2011, Cannizzo
et al. 2012, Osaki & Kato 2013, Still et al. 2010). Nine CVs
were the known prior to launch and targeted for observation by
the Kepler mission (Howell et al. 2013) and over ten additional
CVs have been discovered in the Kepler ﬁeld (e.g. Scaringi et
al. 2013). Among the known CVs, V523 Lyr was especially in-
teresting since it belongs to the open cluster NGC 6791 and the
faint star is poorly classiﬁed/characterized. CVs in star clusters
might form via diﬀerent mechanisms than those in the ﬁeld and
are valuable probes of cluster evolution and dynamics. However,
while predicted, known CVs in open clusters are rare (up to
year 2015 only 4 have been conﬁrmed, among which 3 are in
NGC 6791; van den Berg et al. 2013, Williams et al. 2013). Here
we present the V523 Lyr light curve obtained by Kepler as well
as accompanying Mt. Palomar 200” Hale spectroscopy.

2. V523 Lyr observational history
NGC 6791 is an old (∼8 Gyr) metal rich ([Fe/H]≥+0.4) open
cluster about 4.3 kpc away from our Sun (e.g. Chaboyer et al.
1999, Carraro et al. 2006, Gratton et al. 2006, Grundahl et al.
2008; and references therein). The cluster has been the object of
a number of variable star surveys due to its relatively large num-
ber of blue stragglers and ground-based searches for open cluster
exoplanets. As a result, V523 Lyr has a somewhat extended set
of monitoring observations even preceding the nearly three years
of Kepler observations.
During the ﬁrst “CCD-era” survey of the cluster by Kaluzny
& Udalski (1992), V523 Lyr (≡B7) was discovered as a blue star
(V=18.329 mag, B-V=0.139, and V-I=0.336 mag). It was subse-
quently identiﬁed as a cluster variable (≡V15, Vmax=17.67 mag,
B-V=0.092 mag) by Kaluzny & Rucinski (1993) who observed
a progressive fading of 0.17 mag across their 4 night observ-
ing run. Combining their new and previous observations, they
suggested that V523 Lyr was a (detached) binary hosting a red
dwarf and a hot subdwarf. V523 Lyr was ﬁrst suggested to be an
interacting binary by Liebert et al. (1993) who obtained optical
spectroscopy (3650-5225 Å). Liebert et al. reported a relatively
ﬂat spectral energy distribution with shallow H-Balmer and HeI
absorptions containing narrow emission cores.

Kaluzny et al. (1997) monitored V523 Lyr for 30 nights be-
tween Sep 8 and Nov 1 1996. Their V and I band light curves
showed that V523 Lyr decreased by 3(2) mag in V(I) in less
than 10 days and returned back to V∼18(I∼17.8) mag in ∼25
days (the entire rise time, however, was not covered by the mon-
itoring). Their light curves covered only one small outburst of
amplitude ≤0.6 (0.4) mag in V(I). Kaluzny et al. (1997) comple-
mented their photometric observations with two spectra taken
in early 1997 when V523 Lyr was at V=18.13 mag and V∼19
mag. The brighter spectrum showed a blue continuum, Hα in
emission with the remaining Balmer lines in absorption, possi-

bly including weak emission cores. The photometric time series
obtained during the same night (April 1997) revealed no ﬂick-
ering or orbital modulation. The fainter spectrum, taken on May
1997, revealed only weak H absorptions.

In July 2001, V523 Lyr was observed again in some de-
tail as part of the PISCES survey (Mochejska et al., 2002).
Their 18 non-continuous nights of photometric monitoring de-
tected a 0.6 mag outburst of V523 Lyr. The outburst was char-
acterized by a slow rise (∼4-5 days) and a similarly slow de-
cline (∼5-7 days). The post-outburst magnitude was ∼0.2 mag
fainter than pre-outburst and returned to normal after about 2-
3 days. Mochejska et al. (2003) obtained long-term monitoring
of the cluster and collected 123 nights of observation across al-
most 6 years with the aim of properly characterizing variables
in NGC 6791. Within this monitoring, V523 Lyr showed a sec-
ond deep fading by 3 mag and 4 outbursts of 0.5-1.0 mag in V.
Mochejska et al. (2003) estimated an outburst recurrence time
of 25.4 days. These authors realized that both the outburst recur-
rence time and outburst amplitude were compatible with those
observed in Z Cam type CVs, while the 3 mag drops in light
were reminiscent of VY Scl class. Hence, they remained uncer-
tain about the speciﬁc CV class to which V523 Lyr belongs.

De Marchi et al. (2007) added 10 more days of photomet-
ric monitoring of NGC 6791 during which time V523 Lyr was
found to display fairly erratic photometric behavior showing
0.06 mag intra-night variations and up to 0.15 mag diﬀerences
across nights.

At non-optical wavelengths, a Chandra X-ray survey of
the cluster (van den Berg et al., 2013) detected V523 Lyr at
LX=6.4E30 erg/s (assuming a cluster distance of 4.1 kpc and
a kT=2eV optically thin plasma). van den Berg et al. comment
that the X-ray colors and luminosities of the CVs in their sur-
vey match typical values expected for this class of object. We
shall add, as a comparison, that the dwarf nova SS Cyg has a
measured X-ray ﬂux of LX ∼1E33 erg/s and 1E32 erg/s in qui-
escence and outburst, respectively (Fabbiano et al. 1978). In the
infrared, V523 Lyr remained undetected in the 2nd 2MASS data
release (Hoard et al. 2002).

3. Kepler photometry
Kepler stared at V523 Lyr for 2.7 years (1019 days). Kepler
data were down-loaded and archived in quarters (∼3 months)

Lyr. The large red square indicates the typical aperture size
(∼10x10 pix2, but often not rectangular in shape- see Kinemuchi
et al., 2012) used for V523 Lyr in the standard Kepler pipeline
to produce simple aperture photometry (SAP) light curves. The
small red square indicates the Kepler pixel size (4”) and is shown
here centered on the V523 Lyr position. Typical Kepler PSFs
(noted in the bright stars) are 4 pixels across. S2 and S3 indicate
the two confounding variable stars near V523 Lyr which occa-
sionally fell into the V523 SAP aperture. See Appendix A for
more details.

between which the entire spacecraft, and thus focal plane, is ro-
tated 90 degrees, placing targets on a new set of CCDs. After
one year, targets return to their original locations. V523 Lyr was
observed for a total of 11 quarters (quarters 6 through 16) both
in long cadence (LC, 30 minute integration time) and short ca-
dence (SC, 1 minute integration time). SC observations covered
18 months (quarters 6, 13 and 15) but due to the object faint-
ness, we discuss here only the LC data1. Stars that were observed
by Kepler are given a Kepler Input catalog (KIC) identiﬁcation
number (Brown et al. 2011). This number is ﬁxed throughout the
Kepler mission if the object was listed in the KIC. V523 Lyr was
too faint to be in the catalog, thus it was assigned a special KIC
number for each quarter of observation and for both its LC and
SC data sets. The LC data sets we use in this paper are listed in
Table 1.

V523 Lyr is fairly faint source and located in a relatively
crowded ﬁeld. Fig.1 shows the typical Kepler photometric aper-
ture size (large square) used for V523 Lyr, the additional stars
that would be contained in it, and the Kepler CCD pixel size.
Clearly, the standard Kepler simple aperture photometry (SAP)
light curve would include more than one object and diﬀerent ob-
jects in each quarter due to the 90 degree roll. This might be
irrelevant in the case of a bright target or with large photometric
amplitude, but is not otherwise. In fact, the standard Kepler SAP
light curve of V523 Lyr is biased by two other variable stars in
the same ﬁeld (see Appendix). Thus, we could not use the stan-
dard pipeline produced light curve and worked instead with the
individual calibrated target pixel ﬁles, (targ.ﬁts) available for ev-

1 A few SC data sets were analyzed similarly to the LC ones, as a
cross check. They delivered consistent results, although with noisier
periodograms due to the data quality and interval duration.

ery source in the MAST archive. These ﬁles are small “postage
size” sets of pixels collected for each target for each cadence.
For V523 Lyr, this means one image ﬁle for every 30-min obser-
vation for the entire 2.7 years of data.

For every targ ﬁle, we examined each pixel’s light curve to
identify those pixels which contained the V523 Lyr signal alone.
We then extracted the ﬂux from those individual pixels and coad-
ded the signal to produce each of our light curve points. The best
results were obtained by selecting an aperture of 2 to 5 pixels in
size (depending on the quarter), the majority being of 4 pixels
(i.e., the Kepler PSF). Note that the inclusion of additional pixels
containing the PSF wings usually added trends to the data and
generally degraded the SNR. Details about each aperture size
used and their pixel IDs are reported in Table 2. Each quarter’s
extracted light curve was then normalized by its global median
value and all 2.7 years of data were stitched together. Our ﬁnal
light curve is shown in Fig.2.

The method used above to produce the light curve for
V523 Lyr reduced the typical long-term trends sometimes ob-
served for stars across quarters (Kinemuchi et al. 2012). As
much as most of each quarters light curve matched end-to-end
with the neighbor ones, we did not deem it necessary to ap-
ply any de-trending correction. While some long term trends are
still apparent in Fig.2, we found that when we applied cotrend-
ing corrections, we could not always ﬁnd a combination of the
detrending vectors which would remove such long term trends
in a satisfactory way (e.g. most applications increased the over-
all trends in parts of the light curve and generally increased the
noise in the light curve). With no application of a de-trending
process, it may be that the exact shape of each quarter’s light
curve remains somewhat uncertain. Thus, one has to be care-
ful when interpreting the data keeping in mind that 1) long term
modulations can produce spurious low frequency signals in the
periodogram analysis and 2) the exact shape and amplitude of
each quarter’s global and local light curve is somewhat uncer-
tain, limiting the characterization of the outburst morphologies.

4. Mt. Palomar 200” Hale spectroscopy
V523 Lyr was observed with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP)
mounted on the 200” Hale telescope located at the Mt. Palomar
observatory. DBSP is a double beam, low to mid-resolution
spectrograph capable of covering the wavelength range 3100-
10000 Å depending on the choice of grating. Dichroic ﬁlter D-
55 was used to split light between the blue and red arms. The
blue arm used a 1200 l mm−1 grating providing R∼7700 and cov-
ered 1500Å of spectrum. The red arm used a 1200 l mm−1 grat-

(cid:48)(cid:48)

(cid:48)(cid:48)

ing providing R∼10,000 and covered only 670Å. The slit width
was set to 1
and the usual procedures of observing spectropho-
tometric stars and arc lamps were adhered to. Red spectra were
wavelength calibrated with a HeNeAr lamp while the blue arm
used a FeAr lamp. Data reduction was done using IRAF two-
and one-dimensional image reduction routines for spectroscopic
observations and we produced a ﬁnal one-dimensional spectrum
for each observation.

The observations of V523 Lyr were carried out on UT July 1
and 2, 2013, taking 7 and 8 exposures per night, respectively,
each 1200 sec long. The nights were clear and provided sta-
ble seeing near 1
. We did not have contemporaneous photom-
etry of V523 Lyr, but have estimated its brightness during our
spectroscopic observations in two ways. First, we estimated its
brightness “by eye” using the slit viewer camera and comparing
our target with other stars observed throughout the evening. The
method has large uncertainties of the order of 0.5-0.75 mag. We
estimated V523 Lyr to be near V=20-21 mag. A second more ro-
bust estimate was based on the raw counts collected through the
slit for the standard star Feige 98 and V523 Lyr itself. This has
an uncertainty due to slit losses, but the seeing was stable during
the nights thus these are minimized. Based on a comparison of
the counts received through the slit for both stars, adjusted for
their respective integration times, we ﬁnd that V 523 Lyr was
near a B magnitude of 20.4 +/- 0.5 mags during the two nights.
The magnitude of V523 Lyr during our observations was fainter
than that reported in the literature for previous spectroscopy.

5. Kepler light curve analysis
Cataclysmic variables vary on a large range of time scales, from
minutes to years. In particular, outbursts occur at a cadence of
days/weeks to years while orbital periods range typically from
1.3 hr to ∼10 hr (with few exceptions of CVs showing period of
the order of days). Therefore, the Kepler monitoring allows us to
probe both the outburst’s recurrence time and light curve char-
acteristics/morphology as well as search for the orbital period of
the CV.

5.1. Outbursts and dips
The V523 Lyr light curve is quite complex as it shows outbursts,
dips and oscillations. We list in Table 3 outburst parameters such
as time of maximum, peak ﬂux, and outburst duration. The pa-
rameters were measured on a 33 point running boxcar smoothed
light curve. The duration of each outburst has been measured
in two diﬀerent ways: at a drop of 0.1 in normalized ﬂux from
maximum (FW0.1M) and at 0.15 in normalized ﬂux from max-
imum (FW0.15M), whenever applicable. We observed 28 out-
bursts during the ∼1000 days of Kepler monitoring, but could
measure just 19 since the remaining 9 either had too little am-
plitude or were “incomplete”, i.e. have gaps eﬀecting either the
measure of the peak or the duration of the outburst. For three of
the incomplete outbursts we could measure the maximum. All
the outbursts listed in Table 3 are marked in Fig.3 with their se-
quential ID number. The outbursts for which it was possible to
measure just the maximum time and peak intensity are identiﬁed
by an “X” in the ﬁgure and the table.
Outbursts of V523 Lyr have recurrence times of the order
of weeks with a minimum recurrence time of ∼22 days and a
maximum of ∼54 days (peak to peak). Mochejska et al. (2003)
suggested 25.4 days as the recurrence time while our light curve
ﬁnds 33±4 days as the mean value. The outburst duration is of
the order of ∼1 week (Table 3). The rise tends to be faster than

the decline and most outbursts show a slow brightening before
the ﬁnal jump to maximum (see Fig. 2 and 3). It is also evident
that a few of the observed outbursts show the so called precursor
(e.g. outburst # 2, 4 and 5 and possibly also 6 and 12). However,
these are only marginally longer and not necessarily the bright-
est. All the outbursts are within 10-30% of the “quiescent level”
(normalized at 1), implying brightenings of only −0.1-0.3 mag.
The outburst amplitudes observed in the Kepler observations are
quite smaller than the 0.6 and 0.4 mag “mini-outburst” shown
by Kaluzny et al. (1997) or the 0.5-1.0 mag outbursts seen by
Mochejska et al. (2003). At least a small part of this discrep-

4

ancy can be explained by the diﬀerent transmission function of
the Kepler bandpass2 compared to the Johnson ﬁlters used in the
previous work.

Either way, the observed outburst variations are just fractions
of a magnitude and do not match typical dwarf novae outbursts
(DN, of the U Gem or SU UMa type). They rather resemble
the “stunted” outbursts of some nova likes (NL), old novae and
anomalous Z Cam stars (e.g. Honeycutt et al. 1998, Simonsen
2011). Taken all together, the light curve properties of V523 Lyr
are similar to another recently studied Kepler NL, KIC 9406652
(Gies et al., 2013).
The observed dips seen in the V523 Lyr light curve are also
of small amplitude, amounting to ∼0.1-0.2 mag in the Kepler
bandpass. Their duration is similar to the outburst, i.e. of the
order of 1 week, and, if present, they always follow an outburst.
In particular, they never appear isolated as previously reported
for some NL or old novae observed by Honeycutt et al. (1998).
The dips are not ﬂat bottomed but typically display a relatively
slow decline and a faster rise.

Last but not least, several of the intra-outburst intervals are
characterized by damping oscillations. We sometimes observe
just a single one directly following an outburst or see several
across the whole quiescence period. These oscillations have
varying amplitude, recur on typical time scales of ∼3-4 days
before fading away and are not strictly periodic (see Fig.4).
Because of this, their period analysis (Sec 5.2) does not provide
any reliable result. As much as the oscillations follow an out-
burst, we believe that the mechanism triggering the oscillations
is related to that for the outburst. The latter is still debated (see
section 7, Honeycutt 2001, Hameury & Lasota 2014). However,
we imagine that a damping signal might more easily be repro-
duced/modeled as an accretion disk phenomenon, rather than
ascribing it to the secondary or the primary star. Similar oscil-
lations are commonly observed among the anomalous Z Cam

al. 1998, Honeycutt 2001).

5.2. Short and mid-term temporal variations

After the study of the major semi-regular variations such as out-
bursts and dips, we now move to time-series analysis mainly in
search of the orbital period for V523 Lyr. There are many al-
gorithms in the literature to perform period searches. They are
not all equivalent as they diﬀer in the ability of handling irreg-
ular sampling and/or speciﬁc light curve shapes. They can be
roughly divided in two main groups: the Fourier based and the
dispersion/entropy based (see e.g. Engelbrecht 2013 for a quick
review).

Given our past experience with CV light curves and not-
ing other recent works on Kepler CV light curves, we focused
our time-series analysis on using the Lomb-Scargle method (LS,
Scargle 1982, Horne & Baliunas 1986) and the phase dispersion
minimization technique (PDM, Stellingwerf 1978). The LS peri-
odogram can handle irregular sampling but, similarly to Fourier
analysis, is somewhat limited to sinusoidal shape patterns. PDM
analysis can also handle irregular sampling but is more sensi-
tive to any repeating pattern and therefore often ideal for non-
sinusoidal, irregular light curves. Fig.3 shows the quiescent in-
tervals that we analyzed ﬁrst. Pairs of same color vertical seg-
ments delimit the interval start and end in each quarter. We ex-
plored the period range 0.1–7 days, to include time scales of 3-4
days which are seen to be associated with the damping oscilla-
tions. This search search did not produce any signiﬁcant, coher-
ent period of the order of days. However, it revealed the presence
of two narrow signiﬁcant periods at ∼0.151 and 0.15845048
days (i.e. 3.6 and 3.8 hr). These are shown in Fig.5, top panel.

The 0.158 day period is extremely narrow in the periodogram
and is present through the 20 quiescent intervals marked in Fig.3.
Given its prevalence and extreme coherence we interpret it as the
orbital period of V523 Lyr. Note that Garnavich et al. (2015), in
a meeting abstract, report a weak coherent period at 3.8 hr that
they too suggest as the orbital period. Fig.5, bottom panel, shows
the quiescent interval data phased on the 0.158 day period, after
ﬁt and subtraction of the damping oscillations and trends. The
low amplitude of this modulation might be due to the inclination
of the binary being nearly face on (see Sect.6). The shorter pe-
riod is instead split in at least two broader components at 0.1510
and 0.1504 day. These periods do not show up in at least the ﬁrst
nine intervals and the majority of their power results from inter-
vals 15 through 18. The analysis of these same intervals and their
subsets with the PDM technique produced consistent results.

In order to investigate the full light curve (that is includ-
ing the outbursts), we also created a “running periodogram”
(Fig.6). We produced periodograms using 15 day subsets of the
light curve, oﬀsetting each subset by 7.5 days from the preced-
ing one until we scanned the whole data set. The running pe-
riodogram analysis shows that the ∼0.158 day period is indeed
present throughout the entire light curve (the dips possibly be-
ing the exception), while the ∼0.151 day period is extremely
signiﬁcant only during quarters 14 and 15 (which contain in-
tervals 15 to 18). The 0.151 days period is also clearly visible
in the second-from-top light curve shown in Fig. 4. Its value,
shorter than that of the orbital period, suggests that it might be
interpreted as “negative superhumps”, i.e. light modulations in-
duced by a tilted (by few degrees) accretion disk whose nodal
line is in retrograde precession. The measured period deﬁcit,
ε− = (P− − Porb)/Porb =-0.047, is consistent to that observed
for similarly long orbital period systems (e.g. Table 2 of Wood
et al. 2009) and remarkably similar to the predicted ε− of -0.0456

the above interpretation for “negative superhumps”.

6. Spectroscopic characteristics
Fig.7 shows V523 Lyr Hale spectra taken on Jul 1 and 2 2013, a
few months after Kepler stopped monitoring the source. Despite
collecting several spectra per night, we show just their nightly
mean in the ﬁgure since the SNR of each individual exposure
was low. The red arm exposures has been trimmed (i.e. reduced
in spectral range) to show only the region near Hα which was
placed on a defect free region of the detector.

During both nights, V523 Lyr shows a blue continuum plus
broad H Balmer absorption lines with emission cores; Hα is
purely in emission. We also see He i 4471Å in absorption. We
measured FWHM∼500 km/s in the line emission cores of the
higher transitions of the Balmer series, Hα FWHM being ∼600
km/s. These spectral characteristics are remarkably similar to
those described by Liebert et al. (1993) and Kaluzny et al (1997),
although Liebert et al. report a ﬂatter SED, while Kaluzny and
collaborators remark that V523 Lyr presented emission cores
during the bright/normal state (V=18.13 mag) and no emission
cores when ∼1 mag fainter. If we consider that V523 Lyr was
supposedly ∼20 mag in V at the time of the Hale observations,
the similarity is puzzling. The fainter spectrum in Kaluzny et al.
(1997) was not shown and its resolution is almost a factor of 3
lower than ours, so weak emission cores could have been missed.
Contrarily to Liebert et al. and our spectra here, those of Kaluzny
et al. do not shown He i – which is also puzzling.

V523 Lyr spectra are very similar to those of the anomalous
Z Cam stars V513 Cas and IW And (Szkody et al. 2013). Szkody
et al., comparing the outburst and standstill spectra of each ob-
ject, show that they are very much alike with possibly deeper
absorptions and stronger emission cores during outburst and a
ﬂatter SED at standstill. It should be noted that IW And when
caught in quiescence (i.e. about 2.5 mag fainter than in outburst,
based on the ﬂux calibrated spectra presented in Fig.2 of Szkody
et al. 2013) shows emission lines. It might be that V523 Lyr was
never caught spectroscopically, at any time, in a deep quiescence
state: nor at the time of the historic observations nor during our
run. However, since no precise photometry exists complement-
ing the Hale (and the Kepler) observations, we defer the discus-
sion after further monitoring with simultaneous photometry and
spectroscopy has been taken. Regardless of the exact magnitude
of V523 Lyr during our observations, they seem to describe a
high mass transfer rate CV which is very much alike in spectro-
scopic appearance and photometric behavior to the Z Cam and
(high state) VY Scl stars residing just above the period gap with
orbital periods of 3-6 hr.

While the SNR of the individual spectroscopic exposures
was not suﬃciently high for separate detailed analysis, we did
measure the emission core positions in Hα and Hβ. The line
center shifts between all spectra were found to be ≤1±1Å (i.e.
≤62 km/s). For a typical CV with a 3.8 hr period, we’d expect
to see radial velocity shifts near ±100 km/sec (or more) for a
high orbital inclination system. Therefore the lack of detectable
radial velocity motion suggests that V523 Lyr is a nearly face-on
binary.

7. Discussion: V523 Lyr nature
We have presented the Kepler light curve of V523 Lyr which
across ∼1000 days shows 28 mini outbursts irregularly spaced

(every few to several weeks). Occasionally it shows dips always
following an outburst (and never isolated) and/or oscillations.
Outbursts and dips are “mini” as they appear to be within 0.3
mag amplitude in the Kepler bandpass. The Kepler light curve
shows all the behaviors observed in the many previous reports,
each study observing the system for a limited time. We do not,
however, detect any ∼3 magnitude deep drops as seen in the
past. Mini-outbursts (of the order of ∆m ∼0.6 mag on average),
dips (∆m ∼0.2-1.0 mag; both following an outburst or isolated)
and damping oscillations have been reported by Honeycutt and
coworkers (Honeycutt et al. 1998, Honeycutt 2001) for a num-
ber of NL and old-novae followed within their RoboScope cam-
paign. They named these mini-outbursts “stunted-outbursts” and
reported that at least 25% of NL and old-novae display them.
They also claim that the percentage is most likely much higher
(∼50%) if one considers that the majority of NL and old-novae
had only sparse monitoring so that the observed variations are
not well characterized.

More recently the subclass of “anomalous Z Cam stars”
have been identiﬁed (Hameury & Lasota 2014 and references
therein). The prototype of such a class is probably RX And
whose long term AAVSO light curve has been analyzed by
Schreiber et al. (2002), showing that RX And, displaying both
Z Cam and VY Scl type behavior (i.e. standstill and time of
deep minima), is a transition object between the two classes.
Schreiber et al. (2002) describing the light curve write “RX
And shows large variations of its outburst behavior, i.e. peri-
ods of frequent short low-amplitude outbursts, irregular inac-
tive states, possibly with mini-outburst activity and typical long
dwarf nova outbursts interrupted by disrhythmia”. However, it
was only with the detailed temporal monitoring by Simonsen
within the AAVSO Z-CamPaign (Simonsen 2011), that “the bell
rang” and the anomaly of ∆m ≤1 mag outbursts were really
noticed during the standstill phase of Z Cam stars such as IW
And and V513 Cas3 (see also Szkody 2013, Hameury & Lasota
2014).

Now, a closer look at the Honeycutt “stunted outbursters”
and Simonsen’s anomalous Z Cam stars reveals that the vari-
ability phenomena discussed by those two groups describe es-
sentially identical objects: small outbursts of less that 1 mag in
amplitude, occasional short deeps following the small outbursts
and low amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations. The only diﬀer-
ence is that Honeycutt targets were known NL and old-novae,
while Simonsen targets were Z Cam stars. In other words only
the latter sample had known, well documented standstills and
low states. If we regard the “stunted outbursters” as CVs always
in standstill (i.e. always with a mass transfer rate above the crit-
ical value – see e.g. Lasota 2001), we must admit that we are
dealing with a relatively homogeneous class of objects and, most
important, that we are observing the same astrophysical mecha-
nism, whatever it might be: whether a variable mass transfer rate
(Hameury & Lasota 2014), or a combination of dwarf nova disk
instability and localized thermonuclear burning on the surface of
the white dwarf (Honeycutt 2001). In addition, V523 Lyr’s spec-
tral appearance matches the outburst and standstill spectra of the
anomalous Z Cam stars IW And and V513 Cas (Szkody et al.
2013), reinforcing the suggested connection between this class
of objects and “stunted outbursters”.

By suggesting that NL, old-nova and anomalous Z Cam stars
mini-outbursts rely on the same mechanism, we substantially in-
crease the sample of objects requiring the same astrophysical

quoted here have good, detailed light curves.

explanation. We notice that in addition to the objects targeted
by the RoboScope and Z-CamPaign, a signiﬁcant fraction of the
NL monitored by Kepler are being classiﬁed as “stunted out-
bursters” (see, e.g. Gies et al. 2013, Ramsay et al. 2016). Hence,
this type of object appears to be common, therefore the mecha-
nisms involved to explain their behavior need to be reconsidered
and elucidated.

8. Summary and conclusion
To conclude, the results of the presented analysis can be summa-
rized as follow:
V523 Lyr Kepler light curve shows numerous mini-outbursts
of amplitude ≤0.3 mag in the Kepler bandpass, with durations
of ∼1 week and recurring with an average time scale of 33±9.4
days. The mini-outbursts are often followed by dips, ∼0.1-0.2
Kepler-magnitudes deep and lasting about 1 week and some-

times by damping oscillations as well. The time series analysis
of the light curve shows the presence of an low amplitude persis-
tent and coherent period of 0.15845058 day ((cid:39)3.8 hr) which we
identify with the orbital period of the system. The analysis also
shows the presence of a strong temporary signal at ∼0.151 days
which is consistent with nodal or negative superhumps.

The Hale spectra show that V523 Lyr has a blue SED with
broad H Balmer absorption lines containing emission cores. The
spectra did not show intra- or across-night radial velocity varia-
tions suggesting a quite low orbital inclination.

The V523 Lyr Kepler light curve and the light curves of the
“stunted outbursters” described by Honeycutt et al. are a close
match. In addition, when combined with the historic photo-
metric monitoring in the literature we see that V523 Lyr is an
anomalous Z-Cam star. Its spectra support the same conclusion.
Furthermore, we suggest that anomalous Z Cam and “stunted
outbursters” mini-outbursts are produced by the same mecha-

nism. We also suggest that Honeycutt’s “stunted outbursters” are
systems always in standstill, i.e. with a mass transfer rate above
the critical value for disk stability.

Appendix A: Variable stars in V523 Lyr Kepler

aperture

As mentioned in Sect.3, when examining the V523 Lyr apertures
on a pixel-by-pixel basis, we found two other sources which
are variable and potentially interesting. Neither was present as
a contaminating source for V523 Lyr in every quarter since their
inclusion in the SAP light curve depends on the Kepler im-
ager orientation and the SAP aperture size. We summarize be-
low observational details and period analysis for these two vari-
ables which we called S2 and S3 (V523 Lyr, being implicitly
“star 1”/S1).
S2 is located ∼2-2.5 pixels W and 2.5-3 pixels S of V523
Lyr and could match one of the two stars circled in blue in Fig.1.
It is present in the V523 Lyr SAP light curve during quarters
6,7,8,9,11,13 and 15. S3 is about 6.5 pixels E and 4 pixels N of
V523 Lyr. Its probable identiﬁcation has been marked with the
label S3 in Fig.1. Should S3 match the object indicated in the
ﬁnding chart, it corresponds to a red star of B=18.93, R=18.32

and I=17.88 mag, according to the USNO-B1 catalog. S3 is
present in the V523 Lyr SAP light curve during quarter 6 and
7, in the latter case only the wings of its PSF are included in the
aperture. We remark that for both of these variables, the distance
from V523 Lyr and their listed identiﬁcations are uncertain4 and
should be taken with extreme caution.

The pixels extracted for each of the confounding stars (in
the quarters they were present in the V523 Lyr aperture) are
listed in Table A.1. Both stars were easily noticed for they show
a comparatively large amplitude, periodic pattern. After extrac-
tion of their light curves, we performed a period analysis for
both. The light curves for the variable stars S2 and S3 were “de-
trended” before performing any period analysis. The detrending
was done simply by dividing each quarter’s light curve by its
heavily smoothed version, i.e., using an extremely large running
box (namely ∼500 data points corresponding to ∼10 days). This
ensures that the inherent oscillations remain unchanged as they
are divided by a local “continuum”.

The light curve of S2 is shown in the top panel of Fig.A.1.
The light curves appears to be caused by a rotational modulation
with varying star spot amplitudes. The LS analysis of the com-

large as 0.5-1.0 Kepler pixels.

Fig.A.2 top panel shows the light curve extracted for S3
from quarter 6 observations. S3 shows alternating deep and shal-
low eclipses and a strongly sinusoidal modulation. The light
curve was analyzed with the box-ﬁtting least squares (BLS) al-
gorithm (most appropriate for eclipse searches, Kovacs et al.,
2002) yielding the eclipse period (primary to primary eclipse)
of 4.881696 days; while the best ﬁt sinusoid period is 4.742325
days. We note that the sinusoidal modulation cannot be due to
ellipsoidal variations since the period does not match that of the
eclipses and their relative phase changes constantly. Perhaps this
indicates that one of the stars pulsates or that there is a rotational
modulation not yet tidally locked to the binary period.
