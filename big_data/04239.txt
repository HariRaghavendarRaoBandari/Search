The interplay between Hubbard interaction, long-range hopping and disorder on persistent current
in a mesoscopic one-dimensional conducting ring threaded by a magnetic ﬂux φ is analyzed in detail.
Two diﬀerent methods, exact numerical diagonalization and Hartree-Fock mean ﬁeld theory, are used
to obtain numerical results from the many-body Hamiltonian. The current in a disordered ring gets
enhanced as a result of electronic correlation and it becomes more signiﬁcant when contributions
from higher order hoppings, even if they are too small compared to nearest-neighbor hopping, are
taken into account. Certainly this can be an interesting observation in the era of long-standing
controversy between theoretical and experimental results of persistent current amplitudes. Along
with these we also ﬁnd half-ﬂux quantum periodic current for some typical electron ﬁllings and
kink-like structures at diﬀerent magnetic ﬂuxes apart from φ = 0 and ±φ0/2. The scaling behavior
of current is also discussed for the sake of completeness of our present analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of persistent current was ﬁrst estab-
lished during 1980’s when B¨uttiker and his group have
shown1 that a small conducting ring carries a net circu-
lar current in presence of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ﬂux
φ, and it does not vanish even in presence of disorder.
This is a pure quantum mechanical phase coherence phe-
nomenon and a direct consequence of AB eﬀect2.

The experimental veriﬁcation of it came after few years
when Levy and co-workers did the pioneering experi-
ment3 considering an ensemble of 107 independent Cu
rings. Later several other experiments4–9 were carried
out to conﬁrm the existence of persistent current in dif-
ferent conducting loops. At the same time a substantial
amount of theoretical work10–22 has also revealed sev-
eral unique features along this direction. From the sin-
gle ring measurement3 a period of φ0 (= ch/e, the ele-
mentary ﬂux-quantum) current has been observed, while
some other experiments4,23 have shown both φ0/2 and
φ0 periodic currents. This half ﬂux-quantum (φ0/2) pe-
riodic persistent current is not well explained from theo-
retical calculations and certainly it demands proper anal-
ysis. The another conﬂiction between theoretical and
experimental results is associated with the prediction of
low-ﬁeld currents, viz, slope of the current with ﬂux φ
in the limit φ → 0. Some experiments3,4 have shown
diamagnetic (negative slope) nature, while paramagnetic
(positive slope) response has been noticed from other ex-
periments6. These observations do not really match well
with theoretical observations. Many attempts have been
made along this line and it has been observed that12 the
slope strongly depends on electronic ﬁlling, randomness,
impurities, etc.

Finally, the most important controversy has been
raised during the prediction of current amplitude. Only
for nearly ballistic rings comparable currents are ob-

tained, while for diﬀusive rings the calculated current is
much smaller and in some cases it is even less than two
orders of magnitude compared to the experimental obser-
vations. In order to resolve this long-standing anomaly
in diﬀusive rings, several attempts have been made con-
sidering the eﬀects of diﬀerent parameters. It has been
veriﬁed that on-site Coulomb correlation plays a domi-
nant role13–15 to enhance current amplitude in a disor-
dered ring, though the enhancement is not suﬃcient to
make it comparable to experimental observations. Later
few theoretical models have been given considering the
eﬀect of higher order hopping integrals24,25 in addition
to the usual nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH) in favor of
current enhancement upto a certain level. So naturally
the question comes how the current becomes aﬀected if
one includes the eﬀect of both on-site Coulomb interac-
tion and long-range hopping. This part has not been
discussed so far, to the best of our knowledge.

In the present work we actually focus towards this di-
rection. Here we consider interacting rings with higher-
order hopping integrals and determine energy eigenvalues
by exact numerical diagonalization of many-body tight-
binding Hamiltonian.
In this method we restrict our-
selves to rings with few number of electrons, because of
our computational limitations, as dimension of the ma-
trix raises rapidly with ring size N and total number of
electrons Ne. Diﬀerent combinations of up and down spin
electrons are taken into account and from our results we
observe some similarities in current-ﬂux characteristics
for odd Ne as well as even Ne, which certainly help us
to generalize the results for larger ring size with higher
electrons. However, it is always good to have some def-
inite results of large interacting rings to understand the
interplay between long-range hopping, disorder and e-e
interaction. We thus require an appropriate technique
to work out such a many-body problem. Here we use
Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-ﬁeld theory26–29 to ﬁnd energy
eigenvalues and hence persistent currents, and, compare

these currents with exact exact numerical diagonalization
analysis. Scrutinizing the results we show that persistent
current behaves almost identical in these two methods,
but one can miss some important signatures of current
at some typical ﬂuxes, particularly in the limit φ → 0.
This is an artifact of the mean-ﬁeld calculations.

Several interesting features are obtained from our cal-
culations. The current gets enhanced in a disordered ring
as a result of Coulomb repulsion and it becomes more ef-
fective when higher order hopping integrals are included.
Under this situation current becomes quite comparable
to that of a perfect ring.
In addition we also discuss
the appearance of half ﬂux-quantum periodicity for some
particular electron ﬁllings and some kink-like structures
at diﬀerent ﬂuxes apart from φ = 0 and ±φ0/2. Finally,
scaling behavior of current is also discussed, for the sake
of completeness.

The rest of the work is arranged as follows. In Sec. II
we describe the ring model and theoretical procedure to
construct the Hamiltonian matrix and calculation of per-
sistent current as a function of ﬂux φ. Later, in Sec. III
we discuss numerical results, and ﬁnally, a brief summary
is given in Sec. IV.

II. MODEL AND THEORETICAL

FORMULATION

A. Model and Tight-Binding Hamiltonian

The schematic diagram of our model

is illustrated
in Fig. 1, where a mesoscopic ring is subjected to on-
site Hubbard interaction and long-range hoppings, viz,
second-neighbor hopping (SNH) and third-neighbor hop-
ping (TNH) including nearest-neighbor hopping. Under
the application of an AB ﬂux φ, a net circulating current
is established in the ring.

To describe this model we employ a tight-binding (TB)
framework. For a N -site ring the TB Hamiltonian looks
like,

into the Hamiltonian. Similarly, t1 and t2 denote the
SNH and TNH integrals, respectively, with the associated

current I is established in the ring.

phase factors θ2 = 2θ1 and θ3 = 3θ1. The parameter U
measures the Hubbard interaction strength. Setting ǫj =
constant ∀j we get a perfect ring and without loss of gen-
erality we can ﬁx it to zero, while for a disordered ring
site energies are chosen randomly from a Box distribution
function of width W .

B. Method I: Exact Numerical Diagonalization

Using the TB Hamiltonian, Eq. 1, we construct matrix
elements through the prescription Hmn = hψm|H|ψni,
where |ψmi and |ψni are basis states associated with total
number of up (Nup) and down (Ndn) spin electrons in a
ring. For example, for a ring with two opposite spin
electrons (viz, Nup = Ndn = 1) the state vectors are
like: |ψmi = c†
l↓|0i, where |0i is
the vacuum state. In a similar way, we can choose the
basis states for any ring with diﬀerent Nup and Ndn and
construct the required many-body Hamiltonian matrix.
Diagonalizing this matrix, we ﬁnd energy eigenvalues and
eventually determine persistent current at absolute zero
temperature from the relation

this hopping a phase factor θ1 (= 2πφ/φ0) is introduced

C. Method II: Hartree-Fock Mean-Field Approach

In this method the interacting Hamiltonian H is decou-
pled into two non-interacting parts28,29, say, H↑ and H↓,
associated with up and down spin electrons. Diagonal-
izing these non-interacting Hamiltonians (H↑ and H↓),
we ﬁnd energy eigenvalues, and eventually, calculate the
ground state energy at absolute zero temperature for a
system containing Nup and Ndn spin electrons from the
relation

Finally, persistent current is determined from the re-

φ curve gets increased with higher order hopping which
results a larger current. Here it is important to note that
though TNH strength is much weaker than SNH, it con-

lation given in Eq. 2.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We present our results in two diﬀerent sub-sections. In
the ﬁrst part (sub-section A) we determine persistent cur-
rent by evaluating ground state energy from exact numer-
ical diagonalization of many-body Hamiltonian. Starting
from a ring with two opposite spin electrons we consider
upto six-electron system. For a ﬁxed Ne (= Nup + Ndn),
diﬀerent combinations of Nup and Ndn are taken into ac-
count to explore all the basic features of persistent cur-
rent in interacting rings. While, in the other part (sub-
section B), persistent current is found out by determining
ground state energy from HF mean-ﬁeld approach.

Throughout the analysis we set t = −1 eV (t1 and
t2 are variable and they are mentioned in appropriate
places) and all the energies are scaled with respect to it.
The current is measured in unit of et/h.

Impurity free rings

Let us ﬁrst concentrate on interacting rings without

any impurity i.e., ǫj = 0 ∀ j.

Case 1 - Ring with two electrons: To have an inter-
acting ring with two electrons we consider one up and one
down spin electron i.e., Nup = Ndn = 1. For this con-
ﬁguration we select basis states as |ψmi = c†
q↓|0i and
|ψni = c†
l↓|0i and the dimension of matrix becomes
N 2 × N 2 for a N -site ring.

Figure 2 displays the variation of ground state energy
and corresponding persistent current with φ for a 10-site
ring having two opposite spin electrons for diﬀerent val-
ues of correlation strength U . In the 1st row the results
are shown when the ring is described with only NNH inte-
gral, while in the 2nd row we add the eﬀect of SNH inte-
gral and ﬁnally in the last row both SNH and TNH inte-
grals are taken into account. The results are noteworthy.
(i) The ground state energy exhibits U -independent en-
ergy region across φ = ±φ0/2 and the width of this region
gets increased with increasing U , while it decreases with
the inclusion of higher order hopping integrals, as clearly
seen by comparing the E0-φ spectra given in Figs. 2(a),
(c) and (e). This behavior is nicely reﬂected in current-
ﬂux characteristics yielding a kink-like structure. A sud-
den change in direction of current takes place as a result
of this kink, and interestingly we see that inside a kink
the slope of the current remains unchanged irrespective of
U . (ii) For a ﬁxed correlation strength U , the slope of E0-

with ﬂux φ and associated current for a 10-site ring with two

and SNH; and NNH, SNH and TNH integrals, respectively.

tributes signiﬁcantly to raise the current which is visible
from the spectra given in Figs. 2(d) and (f). Certainly,
more current is expected in presence of additional higher
order hopping, beyond TNH, though their strengths are
vanishingly small. Physically this is easily understand-
able since the incorporation of additional hopping allows
electrons to hop further and thereby increases electronic
current.
(iii) A reduction of current is observed with
increasing U when all the other physical parameters de-
scribing the system remain unchanged. This is solely due
to the repulsive nature of electron-electron (e-e) interac-
tion. It suggests that lesser and lesser current is expected
with increasing U , though it eventually reaches to a ﬁ-
nite value (not shown here) and never drops to zero since
Ne < N , which we verify through our detailed numerical
analysis.

To have a deeper insight about the role of SNH and
TNH integrals in Fig. 3 we present the variation of ground
state energy along with persistent current as a function
of φ considering U = 1 for the same ring size as taken
in Fig. 2 for some typical values of t1 and t2. From the
spectra given in 1st row we see that with increasing t1
current gets enhanced following energy-ﬂux diagram but
it (t1) reduces the kink size. Further enhancement of
current can be also made possible with the inclusion of
TNH (see Fig. 3(d)), and like t1, t2 is also responsible
for the reduction of kink size, though these kinks do not

are observed. (i) Ground state energy exhibits half-ﬂux-

ﬂected in the current-ﬂux characteristics. To illustrate
this fact we can set the interaction strength U to zero,
since it does not aﬀect φ0/2 periodicity (which is shown
from the E0-φ and I-φ spectra). Due to this simpliﬁca-
tion we can handle the problem very easily as it becomes

with three electrons (Nup = 2, Ndn = 1), where the ﬁrst,

The other parameters are: t1 = −0.1 and t2 = −0.05.

now a non-interacting one. For N = 3, three energy
eigenstates are obtained where each of these states can
have maximum two opposite spin electrons. Therefore,
ground state energy is obtained by placing two opposite
spin electrons in the lowest non-interacting energy level
and the third electron (up spin) in the ﬁrst excited level.
Quite interestingly, we observe that all such distinct en-
ergy levels have φ0 ﬂux-quantum periodicity. But as long
as the highest accessible energy level (here it is 1st excited
state) contains a single electron, instead of two, the net
ground state energy of the system gets strange φ0/2 pe-
riodicity. This peculiar φ0/2 periodicity also remains un-
changed even in presence of U , which we claim from our
results. (ii) No kink-like structure appears in I-φ curves
which implies that at half-ﬁlling no U -independent state
contributes to the lowest energy for any ﬂux window.

For such ﬁlling, current decreases rapidly with the cor-

relation strength U , as there is no empty site.

• Non-half-ﬁlled ring: The results of a three-electron non-
half-ﬁlled ring (N = 8) are shown in Fig. 5 which exhibit
some interesting patterns unlike the half-ﬁlled case. (i)
From the spectra it is shown that the φ0/2 periodicity
disappears and the current, associated with ground state
energy, regains its usual φ0 periodicity. (ii) The kink-like
structure, associated with U -independent states, appears

in persistent current across φ = 0 at suﬃciently large
value of U , and the width of such kink decreases with
the inclusion of higher order hopping integrals like SNH
and TNH. In this context it is important to note that for
two-electron case, kink appears as long as the interaction
is turned on. The other features viz, the reduction of cur-
rent with U and its enhancement with higher order hop-
ping integrals remain same as discussed in a two-electron
ring system.

Case 3 - Ring with four electrons: For four-electron
system we consider two distinct conﬁgurations depending
on Nup and Ndn. In one conﬁguration we set Nup = 3 and
Ndn = 1, while for the other we choose Nup = Ndn = 2.

around φ = ±φ0/2, while for ﬁnite U the current gets re-
duced and varies continuously with φ. This continuous-
like variation is not quite trivial as obtained in traditional
disordered case. While, the reduction of current with U
is anticipated easily for this half-ﬁlled case.

Away from half-ﬁlling some kink-like structures are vis-
ible in I-φ spectra reﬂecting the E0-φ curves, and the
most crucial point is that these kinks are generated as
a result of U -dependent states, not like U -independent
states as described earlier. The results are shown in Fig. 7
for a 8-site ring considering the eﬀects of higher order
hopping (SNH and TNH) integrals for diﬀerent values of
U . The kink appears for a suﬃciently large value of U
and its width gradually decreases as a result of higher
order hopping.

FIG. 8: (Color online). Variation of ground state energy and
corresponding current for a four-site ring with Nup = 2 and
Ndn = 2 for diﬀerent strengths of U considering NNH only.

(U = 0), current exhibits a sharp transition similar to
that as obtained in the previous 4-electron half-ﬁlled ring,
but the transition takes place at φ = 0. All the other fea-
tures, viz, the continuous like variation of current with

φ and its reduction as a result of electronic correlation
remain almost similar as presented in Fig. 6. But there
is a crucial diﬀerence between these two sets of electronic
conﬁgurations. Comparing the current spectra given in
Figs. 6(b) and 8(b) it is seen that the suppression of cur-
rent due to e-e interaction becomes more signiﬁcant for
the ring with Nup = 3 and Ndn = 1 compared to the
other case. The reason is that in the ﬁrst case where
Nup > Ndn, the hopping probability of up spin electrons
is less compared to the ring with Nup = Ndn since in
the later case pairing of up and down spin electrons in a
single site is possible as a result of hopping term for low

FIG. 9: (Color online). E0-φ and I-φ curves for a 7-site ring

both these two cases current gets reduced.

Focusing on the spectra given in Fig. 9 apparently it
seems that the features are almost identical with the re-
sults shown in Fig. 7, but there is a striking diﬀerence be-
tween the two. For this conﬁguration (Nup = Ndn = 2)
kink, associated with U -dependent states, appears for
any non-zero correlation strength U , unlike the previous
case (Nup = 3 and Ndn = 1) where a critical U (say Uc) is
required. Apart from this, other qualitative features are
almost identical. For all these four-electron ring systems
we get only φ0 periodic persistent current.

Case 4 - Ring with ﬁve electrons: Now we move to
the ﬁve-electron ring system and here we also consider
two distinct conﬁgurations depending on Nup and Ndn.
In one conﬁguration we set Nup = 3 and Ndn = 2, while
for the other we ﬁx Nup = 4 and Ndn = 1.

FIG. 10: (Color online). E0-φ and I-φ characteristics for a
ﬁve-electron (Nup = 3 and Ndn = 2) half-ﬁlled ring, where
the ﬁrst row corresponds to the ring with only NNH integral
and the second row describes the ring with NNH and SNH
(t1 = −0.1) integrals. Here TNH does not make any sense.

In the ﬁrst row, results are given when the ring is de-
scribed with only NNH, while in the other row we con-
sider the eﬀect of SNH integral too. For this ﬁve-site ring
inclusion of TNH does not make any sense, since long-
range hopping in shortest path is only the physically ac-
cessible hopping parameter. Several notable features are
obtained. (i) For the ring described with only NNH, cur-
rent exhibits half-ﬂux-quantum (φ0/2) periodicity and it
is not at all aﬀected by the electronic correlation. This
is exactly the same what we get in a three-electron half-
ﬁlled ring (see Fig. 4). (ii) But surprisingly we see that
the φ0/2 periodicity disappears when the eﬀect of higher
order hopping is included (Fig. 10(d)). From these re-
sults we can generalize that φ0/2 periodicity is speciﬁc
to the odd-half-ﬁlled rings described with only NNH inte-
gral. Other properties like the reduction of current with
U and the role of higher order hopping on current en-
hancement remain same as discussed for other cases.

The results for a ﬁve-electron (Nup = 3 and Ndn = 2)
non-half-ﬁlled ring are placed in Fig. 11 considering some
typical values of U . All the basic features of ground state
energy and corresponding current shown in this spectra
(Fig. 11) are almost similar to those given in Fig. 5 for a
three-electron non-half-ﬁlled ring. For this ﬁve-electron
system we can also observe kink-like structure in persis-
tent current above a critical value of U , like the three-
electron interacting ring. The critical value Uc is very
large for this 7-site ring (which is not shown here in the
ﬁgure) and it (Uc) becomes smaller for larger ring which
we conﬁrm through our detailed numerical calculations.

The half-ﬂux-quantum periodicity is still preserved for
a half-ﬁlled ﬁve-electron ring even when we set Nup = 4
and Ndn = 1. But the requirement is that the ring should
be described with only NNH hopping, and the electronic
correlation does not have any explicit dependence on it.
But as long as the eﬀect of higher order hopping is in-
corporated, φ0/2 periodicity gets lost and the current
regains its conventional φ0 periodicity. These features
are clearly presented in Fig. 12 and consistent with the
results shown in the spectra Fig. 10.

In the non-half-ﬁlled case some anomalous features ap-
pear in persistent current associated with ground state
energy in presence of e-e interaction. The results for
a seven-site ring are displayed in Fig. 13 considering
Nup = 4 and Ndn = 1. For U = 0, sharp transitions
are available, while sudden phase change in current takes
place at some typical ﬂuxes in presence of U due to U -
dependent states as seen from the I-φ spectra. Here only

a sharp jump across φ = ±φ0/2, while it varies contin-
uously with reduced amplitude in presence of ﬁnite e-e
interaction. Exactly identical behavior is obtained for the
four-electron half-ﬁlled ring. Thus it can be emphasized
that there exists a striking similarity between all half-
ﬁlled rings with even number of electrons under NNH
approximation. With the addition of higher order hop-
ping (here it is SNH), some anomalous oscillations appear
as a result of phase reversal of ground state energy.

Away from half-ﬁlling kink-like structure appears fol-
lowing the variation of ground stage energy and the width
of this kink decreases with the incorporation of addi-
tional hopping integrals (see Fig. 15), similar to the four-
electron ring system. In addition, current exhibits more
complex structure in presence of TNH for large U .

The characteristics features of ground state energy to-
gether with persistent current for a half-ﬁlled six-electron
ring with Nup = 4 and Ndn = 2 are shown in Fig. 16 for
some typical values of U . Comparing the spectra given in
Figs. 14 and 16 it is noticed that almost identical varia-
tion of current is obtained apart from a shifting along the

ﬂux line. In one case the sharp transition for U = 0 takes
place at φ = ±φ0/2 (Fig. 14), while in the other case it
occurs at φ = 0 (Fig. 16) for the identical strength of U .
These features, in fact, are quite similar to the results
discussed for two diﬀerent conﬁgurations in the half-ﬁlled
four-electron ring system. Certainly, these observations
demand that all half-ﬁlled rings with even number of elec-
trons exhibit qualitatively identical patterns.

Quite similar argument can also be applicable for the

and associated current with ﬂux φ for a seven-site ring consid-

spectra given in Fig. 17, like the non-half-ﬁlled ring with
three up and three down spin electrons (see Fig. 15).
Due to smaller size of the ring (where Ne is very close
to N ) current gets suppressed signiﬁcantly with increas-
ing the correlation strength and this eﬀect dominates for
the maximum unequal distribution among up and down
spin electrons keeping the total number of electrons con-
stant. For all these six-electron ring systems we get only
φ0 periodic persistent current, like two-electron and four-
electron cases.

2. Eﬀect of impurity

Now we investigate the role of impurities on persistent
current and the interplay between Hubbard interaction
and long-range hopping on it. To introduce impurities in
a ring we choose on-site potentials (ǫj) randomly from a
‘Box’ distribution function of width W setting the win-
dow region −W/2 to W/2. Since the response strongly
depends on disordered conﬁgurations, we compute all the
results taking average over a large number of distinct
such conﬁgurations and below we present some of these
essential results.

Case I - Ring with two electrons: To investigate
the critical role played by disorder in Fig. 18 we display
the dependence of ground state energy together with per-
sistent current as a function of φ for a twenty-site ring
considering two opposite spin electrons setting the dis-
order strength W = 1. In presence of disorder current

becomes vanishingly small (red curve of Fig. 18(b)) for
the non-interacting ring (U = 0) described with NNH
integral. This is solely due to electronic localization as
electrons get pinned at diﬀerent sites associated with the
on-site potentials, and, it becomes even smaller for higher
W (not shown here in the ﬁgure to save space). Now un-
der this situation current gets enhanced if we include the
eﬀect of electronic correlation(green line of Fig. 18(b)).
This correlation tries to homogenize the system providing
enhanced current. But the enhancement becomes more

FIG. 18: (Color online). E0-φ and I-φ characteristics for a

signiﬁcant when the contributions from higher order hop-
ping integrals are taken into account. This is clearly seen
from the cyan and purple curves of Fig. 18(b). Thus it
can be emphasized that the eﬀect of localization as a
result of disorder in NNH model can be suppressed sig-
niﬁcantly by introducing higher order hopping integrals
in presence of e-e interaction. The available current for
the disordered ring in presence of higher order hopping
integrals is quite comparable to the current obtained for
a perfect non-interacting ring described with only NNH
integral which, on the other hand, is very close to the
experimental observations. Therefore, only NNH model
is not suﬃcient to verify experimental results where the
rings invariably contain disorder and certainly we have
to go beyond NNH model.

Apart from this we also ﬁnd that sudden phase re-
versal of current takes place around φ = ±φ0/2 due to
U -independent states, like the two-electron ordered ring,
but for this disordered case the kink appears beyond a
critical value of U (= Uc, say) and it depends on ring size
as well as disorder strength. Whereas, any non-zero value
of U yields kink-like structure in the ordered ring. For all
these cases current exhibits φ0 ﬂux-quantum periodicity.

Case II - Ring with three electrons: Finally, let us
focus on the response of a three-electron disordered ring.
In Fig. 19 we present the variation of ground state
energy together with persistent current for a half-ﬁlled

(N = 3) disordered ring, described with NNH integral,
considering Nup = 2 and Ndn = 1. To reveal the precise
role of disorder on periodicity of ground state energy as
well as current with φ, here we superimpose the result
of an ordered interacting ring (green curve). From the
spectra it is seen that φ0/2 periodicity no longer exists

ten-site ring. A signiﬁcant enhancement of current takes
place in presence of electronic correlation and higher or-
der hopping integrals, and, sometimes this enhancement
becomes two orders of magnitude larger compared to the
NNH model.

Before we ﬁnish this sub-section we would like to point
out that the characteristic features of ground state ener-
gies and corresponding persistent currents for other dis-
ordered rings with four, ﬁve and even six electrons are
reviewed thoroughly and from our analysis we ﬁnd ex-
actly similar kind of enhancement and identical periodic
nature of current in the presence of e-e interaction and
long-range hopping.

Scaling behavior

The results analyzed so far are worked out for some typ-
ical interacting rings taking diﬀerent combinations of up
and down spin electrons, and, these results exhibit cer-
tain similarities among the rings with even number (two,
four and six) of electrons as well as rings with odd num-
ber (three and ﬁve) of electrons. To make the analysis a
self-contained one, now we discuss the dependence of cur-
rent with ring size N and from it we establish its scaling
behavior.

Figure 21 displays the dependence of current (I max)
as a function of N considering U = 1 and Ne = 2
(Nup = Ndn = 1), where I max is obtained by taking the

and other is for W = 1, are described those are given in
(a) and (b), respectively. The dotted points, correspond-
ing to current for diﬀerent N , are computed following the
exact diagonalization method, and, using these dots we
construct a scaling behavior of current which generates
the continuous line. The scaling relation gets the form:
I max = CN −ξ, where the constant C becomes 30 for both

ordered and disordered cases, while the exponent ξ be-
comes diﬀerent in these two cases. It is 1.65 for W = 0
and 1.75 for W = 1. Usually, for a particular ﬁlling this
constant (C) depends on the disorder strength, but for
this typical Ne we ﬁnd its identical value both for the

only NNH integral in the limit of half-ﬁlling consider-
ing diﬀerent values of electronic correlation strength U .

ordered and disordered rings which we conﬁrm through
elaborate numerical calculations.

In Fig. 22 we present the variation of current with ring
size N for Ne = 3 (considering Nup = 2 and Ndn = 1),
keeping all other physical parameters the same as taken
in Fig. 22. Like two-electron system, here we also get
similar kind of scaling relation, viz, I max = CN −ξ, where
the constant C becomes 22 and 16, and, the exponent ξ
reaches to 1.45 and 1.55 for the ordered and disordered
cases, respectively.

In the same way we can also check scaling behavior of
persistent current in higher-electron systems (i.e., rings
with four, ﬁve, six and more electrons), and from our
analysis it can be emphasized that in each case current
obeys the identical scaling relation, viz, I ∝ N −ξ. This
exponent ξ gradually decreases, both for ordered and dis-
ordered cases, with Ne and for Ne ≥ 5 it almost reaches
to the limiting value 1.33 at U = 1, which is consistent
with the previous analysis done by Gendiar et al30 using
bosonization techniques. Our analysis clearly suggests
that the current decreases algebraically with ring size N .

FIG. 24: (Color online). E0-φ and I-φ spectra for some typ-
ical ordered rings, described with only NNH integral, in the
half-ﬁlled band case considering diﬀerent values of U . In the
ﬁrst row we choose N = 5, Nup = 3 and Ndn = 2, while in
the second row these parameters are: N = 41, Nup = 21 and
Ndn = 20.

In this sub-section we present numerical results com-
puted from HF mean-ﬁeld approach and compare these
results with those obtained from the other method i.e.,
exact numerical diagonalization.

Figure 23 displays the dependence of ground state en-
ergy together with persistent current as a function of ﬂux
φ for some typical ordered rings (even N ) described with

numerical diagonalization method. Comparing the spec-
tra Figs. 23(b) and 14(b) we see that MF results are
highly consistent with our data obtained from exact nu-
merical diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian.
Therefore, we can certainly rely on MF solutions and ex-
tend our analysis to larger lings. As illustrative example,
in the second row of Fig. 23 we present the MF results

for a 50-site ring, and they exhibit almost identical fea-
tures, like a 6-site ring, which yield the invariant nature
of energy- and current-ﬂux characteristics for diﬀerent
ring sizes when the ﬁlling factor remains constant.

In a similar way we now focus our attention on the
rings with odd N . The results are shown in Fig. 24
where we present the behavior of ground state energy
and corresponding persistent current, obtained from MF
technique, for two diﬀerent ring sizes. The spectra for
N = 5 (ﬁrst row of Fig. 24) can be directly compared
to the results given in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 10 since all
the physical parameters are same for these two cases.
Quite interestingly we see that almost all the features,
viz, suppression of current with U and half ﬂux-quantum
periodicity as a function of φ remain unchanged. But, for
narrow regions of φ the slope of the currents for non-zero
U shows opposite signature in these two diﬀerent numer-
ical methods, while it (slope) remains same for other ﬂux

FIG. 25: (Color online). Variation of persistent current for
a 60-site disordered (W = 1) ring, where (a) Nup = Ndn =
30 and (b) Nup = Ndn = 15. The red line corresponds to
the disordered non-interacting (U = 0) ring with only NNH
integral, while introducing the eﬀect of e-e interaction (U =
0.5) in this ring we get cyan curve. The green curve represents
the ring with disorder, e-e interaction (U = 0.5) and SNH
integral (t1 = −0.2), whereas the purple line corresponds to
the ring with disorder, e-e interaction (U = 0.5), SNH (t1 =
−0.2) and TNH (t2 = −0.05) integrals.

regions. This is the peculiarity of MF calculations and
can be noticed for any other ordered rings with odd N in
the limit of half-ﬁlling. To substantiate it in the second
row of Fig. 24 we present the results for a 41-site ring
considering Nup = 21 and Ndn = 20, and see that all the
properties exhibited by a 5-site ring are nicely followed
in this bigger ring.

Finally, let us focus on the MF results given in Fig. 25

12

where we present the variation of persistent current for
a 60-site ring as a function of φ considering two diﬀerent
band ﬁllings those are placed in (a) and (b), respectively.
Four distinct cases are analyzed depending on the physi-
cal parameters of the system. The red curve corresponds
to the current for the non-interacting (U = 0) disordered
(W = 1) ring described with only NNH integral. While
introducing the eﬀect of e-e interaction in this ring we
get cyan curve. The green line represents the current for
the ring with disorder, e-e interaction and SNH integral,
whereas incorporating further the eﬀect of TNH integral
in this ring we get the current shown by the purple curve.
At half-ﬁlling all the currents are quite comparable with
each other (Fig. 25(a)) and higher order hopping integrals
do not actually play any such signiﬁcant role in enhancing
the current since it is counterbalanced by the repulsive
Coulomb interaction. On the other hand, at less than
half-ﬁlling an enhancement of current takes place as a
result of U and it becomes more signiﬁcant in presence
of higher order hopping integrals (Fig. 25(b)) as there
exists empty sites where electrons can hop quite easily
yielding more current. These mean-ﬁeld results are fully
consistent with our exact numerical diagonalization anal-
ysis (see Figs. 19 and 20).

IV. CLOSING REMARKS

To conclude, in this work we have investigated the be-
havior of ground state energy and persistent current in
interacting mesoscopic rings subjected to AB ﬂux φ in
presence of long-range hopping and disorder. Two dif-
ferent methods, exact numerical diagonalization and HF
mean-ﬁeld theory, have been used to compute numerical
results of the many-body systems, and, found that the
results obtained from these two methods are highly con-
sistent with each other. The interplay between Hubbard
interaction and long-range hopping integrals yields a sig-
niﬁcant enhancement of persistent current in disordered
ring which in some cases becomes comparable to that of
an ordered ring and reaches very close to the experimen-
tal observations. This phenomenon suggests that only e-e
interaction is not suﬃcient to explain the enhancement
of persistent current in a disordered ring described with
NNH integral. We have to incorporate the eﬀect of higher
order hopping integrals. From our results we have shown
that even for too small values of t1 and t2 compared to t,
current gets enhanced signiﬁcantly. In addition, we have
also discussed the appearance of φ0/2 periodic current for
some typical electron ﬁllings and its sensitivity on higher
order hopping as well as randomness. Finally, we have
analyzed the scaling behavior of current which suggests
an asymptotic decay with ring size N .
