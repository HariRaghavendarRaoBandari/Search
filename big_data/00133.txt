Abstract

This paper presents the asymptotic analysis of random lattices in high dimensions to clarify the distance

properties of the considered lattices. These properties not only indicate the asymptotic value for the distance

between any pair of lattice points in high-dimension random lattices, but also describe the convergence behavior of

how the asymptotic value approaches the exact distance. The asymptotic analysis further prompts new insights into

the asymptotic behavior of sphere-decoding complexity and the pairwise error probability (PEP) with maximum-

likelihood (ML) detector for a large number of antennas.

I. INTRODUCTION

T Here has been a great deal of research over the past several decades on the lattice theory [1]-

[20]. The studies span multiple disciplines and include mathematics [1]-[4], information theory

[5]-[11], communication [17][18], and signal processing [19][20]. In lattice theory, previous efforts have

been mostly on or related to the closest point search (CPS) problem and its low-complexity algorithms.

Pioneering works [1]-[4] have laid a ﬁrm foundation for the Fincke-Pohst algorithm (a.k.a. sphere-decoding

algorithm) and the Schnorr-Euchner algorithm, which became the mainstream of the CPS algorithms. The

contributions of these works are of decisive importance, but the subject has not ended with them.

Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the CPS problem and its algorithms, while this interest

was intensiﬁed by the connection between CPS and maximum-likelihood (ML) detection in multiple-

input multiple-output (MIMO) channels [6][8][9][14][18]. In principle, one can represent the MIMO

environment by a lattice sphere packing, and applying the universal lattice decoder in a MIMO system

[18]. Nowadays, the emerging large-MIMO systems which rely on very large antenna arrays have become

a hot topic of communications, because as the demands on data rate and throughput increase dramatically,

the number of antennas needs to be scaled up to tens or hundreds to fulﬁll performance requirements

[26][27].

Many studies are performed for the algorithm design of large-MIMO detection (see [25][26] and

references therein) and the corresponding large-system performance and complexity analysis [23]. Jalden

and Ottersten [21], Liang et al. [23], Evans and Tse [30], Biglieri et al. [31], Loyka and Levin [32] have

gained deep insights into the large-MIMO detection and associated system performance very early, even

before the beneﬁt of large-MIMO systems was widely recognized, which shows their impressive foresight.

Motivations of this paper: First, the overwhelming majority of existing works concern large-MIMO

systems and detection[21][23][26][27][30]-[32], but little attention was paid to the lattices in high di-

mensions, even though the large-MIMO systems are closely related to the lattices in high dimensions.

The points of interest of lattice theory are, after all, not entirely the same as those of MIMO system.

Hence, for the sake of completeness of the lattice theory, it is important to investigate the lattices in

high dimensions, which is not to simply duplicate works already done in the large-MIMO systems, but

to obtain new theoretical results from a unique perspective of lattice theory.

Second, the studies in [21][31][32] resort to asymptotic analysis to approximate the exact performance

3

of large-MIMO system and the complexity of large-MIMO detection with the asymptotic performance and

complexity, respectively, because the asymptotic performance and complexity can usually be expressed

in closed-form. However, these works seldom ﬁgure out what the convergence behaviors will be as

the asymptotic values approach the exact ones. Thus, of particular importance now is to clarify these

convergence behaviors.

Third, by far, the most widely known limit of the sphere-decoding algorithm is the exponential complex-

ity in large systems [21][22]. Jalden and Ottersten have shown that the complexity of the sphere-decoding

algorithm is exponential in the dimension m of the transmitted symbol vector when applied to MIMO

detection. This is sketchily due to the fact that the sphere radius has to grow linearly with m to ensure

that the transmitted signal is found inside the sphere with non-vanishing probability also for large m

[22]. It is worth attempting to ﬁnd a more intuitive explanation for the exponential complexity of the

sphere-decoding algorithm, and then seek new methods of reducing the complexity of the algorithm to

be subexponential or even polynomial without sacriﬁcing other performances.

Contributions: First, we present the asymptotic analysis of random lattices in high dimensions to clarify

the distance properties of the considered lattices. To analyze the distance properties for lattices is not a

trivial task, especially for random lattices, and it seems unlikely that closed-form expressions for any but

trivial systems will exist. In this paper, we derive the Chernoff bound related expressions of the distance

properties (Theorem 1, Corollaries 1, 2). These properties, on the one hand, indicate an asymptotic value

of the distance between any pair of lattice points in high-dimension random lattices (Corollary 1), and

on the other hand, describe the convergence behaviors of how the asymptotic values approaches the exact

distances (Theorem 1 and Corollary 2).

Second, the asymptotic analysis prompts new insights into the asymptotic behavior of the sphere-

decoding complexity and the pairwise error probability (PEP) with ML detector for a large number of

antennas. Firstly, we derive a new lower bound of the expected sphere-decoding complexity (Theorem

2), which applies to random (ﬁnite) lattices as well as Rayleigh-fading MIMO systems with traditional

constellation schemes (e.g., QAM, PAM, and PSK). This lower bound makes us recognize that the partial

4

cause of the exponential complexity of sphere-decoding algorithm is the codebook used to generate

the lattices (Remark 1). Secondly, we point out the theoretical existence and a train of thought of

designing the proper codebook that might be able to realize the sphere-decoding algorithm in high-

dimension random lattices with subexponential or even polynomial complexity without giving rise to the

decrease of other performances (Remark 3). Finally, we take a closer look at the convergence rate of

pairwise error probability (PEP) with ML detector for a large number of antennas (Corollary 4).

II. RANDOM LATTICES

An m-dimensional lattice in the unitary space Cn is generated as the integer linear combination of the

set of linearly independent vectors

where gi ∈ Cn, and G = [g1 g2 · · · gm] represents a basis of the lattice (G is also called the generator
matrix). In the matrix form,

Λ = {y = Gx |x ∈ CZm} .

It is assumed that κ = n/m ≥ 1 is a constant without loss of generality.

The random lattices to be analyzed in this paper are generated by the generator matrix G with i.i.d.

zero-mean complex Gaussian CN (0, 1/n) entries, which in communications [17][18][21] can be used to
model the received signal vectors (without being corrupted by noise) in Rayleigh-fading multiple-input

multiple-output (MIMO) systems by letting y, G, and x be the received signal vector, channel matrix,

and transmitted signal vector, respectively. Therefore, although the traditional lattice formulation is mostly

constructed in Euclidean space [5], we will investigate the lattices in unitary space by referring to [13][17].

In fact, the results obtained by this study shall also be established for random lattices in Euclidean space.

Here, note that, a Euclidean space is a ﬁnite-dimensional, real linear space with a symmetric positive-

deﬁnite inner product, and a unitary space is a complex linear space with a Hermitian positive-deﬁnite

inner product. Both spaces with the ℓ2 norm kxk2 =(cid:0)Pn

the ℓ2 norm induces a metric (a notion of distance). This metric is deﬁned in the natural way: The distance

between two vectors p and q is given by kp − qk2.

The CPS problem refers to ﬁnding, for given lattice Λ with a known generator G and a given input

point by ∈ Λ, a vector x ∈ CZm such that the squared distance metric kby − Gxk2

From Theorem 1 we can also get the below extended result.

Corollary 1. As n tends to inﬁnity while n/m = κ > 1,

Proof: By letting θ = 1 + ε (or θ = 1− ε) where the positive ε is arbitrarily close to zero, kGbx+w−Gxk2

At ﬁrst glance, one could observe that Theorem 1 and its derivation shall establish for any positive

integer n. Then a question arose, why this study limits the investigation to the case of large n. Our main

concern is that only when n is sufﬁciently large,(cid:0)θe1−θ(cid:1)n as a upper bound can determinately take (very)
little value such that kGbx + w − Gxk2

2 can be very close to kbx − xk2

Furthermore, without the presence of Gaussian noise w, the inequalities in Theorem 1 can be simpliﬁed

Proof: Corollary 2 is a special case of Theorem 1 by assuming that w = 0 ∈ Cn and N0 = 0.

random lattices in high dimension, but the beneﬁt will in the following section be made clear by applying

these results to concrete applications.

IV. APPLICATIONS

We will apply the main results obtained above to (i) the asymptotic analysis of the sphere-decoding

complexity, (ii) the consideration on the codebooks of x for the sphere-decoding algorithm in high-

dimension random lattices, and (iii) the convergence rate of pairwise error probability (PEP) with ML

detector for a large number of antennas.

A. Asymptotic Behavior of Sphere-Decoding Complexity

Before entering into deeper discussion, we assume that x of lattice in (2) comes from a ﬁnite codebook

1

Cx with |Cx| codewords {x(1),· · · , x(Cx)} and an overall power constraint on the codebook Cx, that is,
m|Cx|Px∈Cx kxk2
2 = Ex exists, such that the average power of each entry in x is Ex. In communications,

the problem of (3) is known as the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection problem for which x is always

assumed to be drawn from a codebook as [9][14][18]

Cx = Cm

τ,L

, {x|Re[x], Im[x] ∈ R ∩ [τ τ + L − 1]}m,

(8)

where L regulates the set size for each entry of x. In the remainder of this section, we suppose that x

uses the codebook of (8) by default, unless explicitly stated.

The worst-case complexity for solving the CPS problem optimally for generic lattices is NP-hard, while

the search of lattice points can be realized efﬁciently by sphere decoding [7][18]. The main idea of the

sphere-decoding algorithm for solving the problem (3) is based on enumerating all points x such that

Gx lies within a sphere of radius ρ centered at by, that is, on enumerating all x subject to the sphere

constraint (SC)[13][21]

10

and then choosing the one that minimizes the distance metric.

k × k bottom right (upper triangular) submatrix of R associated with bxk − xk.

This means that the sphere-decoding algorithm is able to identify whether the lattice points locate in

the considered sphere by using the recursive sphere constraint (RSC)

starting from k = 1 to m, and ﬁnally, ending with kRmbxm + w′m − Rmxmk2
As it is customary in the literature (cf. [13][21]), for given G,bx, and w, the sphere-decoding complexity,
CSD(G,bx, w), is usually deﬁned as the number of lattice points searched by the algorithm, that is, the

total number of vectors xk, k = 1,· · · , m, that satisﬁes the RSCs in (12), such that

2 = kRbx + w′ − Rxk2

2 ≤ ρ2(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

The expected complexity of the sphere-decoding algorithm is thereafter computed by

By deﬁnition, we directly obtain a lower bound of CSD as

A general agreement in the community exists that the sphere-decoding complexity can be reduced by

CSD ≥ E[NSC(G,bx, w)].

employing the preprocessing techniques such as lattice-reduction (LR) or layer-sorting (LS) [20]; however,

E[NSC(G,bx, w)] is only determined by the SC in (9) and shall not be affected by these techniques. In
essence, most preprocessing techniques aim to cut down Pm−1
k=1 Nk(Rk,bxk, w′k) for CSD(G,bx, w), and
thus, E[NSC(G,bx, w)] represents a theoretical limit to which CSD tries to approach. Note that this study

did not consider the early-termination strategies or adaptive radius-updating strategies which are heuristic

methods of complexity reduction for the sphere-decoding algorithm and could impact E[NSC(G,bx, w)].

It shall be emphasized that Theorem 2 (with slight modiﬁcations) can be applied to Rayleigh-fading

MIMO systems with traditional constellation schemes, for example, QAM, PAM, and PSK [33]. Because

by mapping the elements x ∈ Cτ,L to elements s ∈ S using the transformation s = ax + b, the CPS
problem is equivalent to a MIMO detection problem in wireless communications [9][14][18], where S

denotes the set of constellation used by the multiple-antenna systems.

For the sphere-decoding algorithm in digital communications, the expected complexity is proved in

[21] to be lower bounded by an exponential function of L, in considering the L-PAM constellation and

Rayleigh-fading channel matrix H with a power constraint as E[khik2
notations of this study, the above bound can be written as

We hasten to compare (13) and (14) for clarifying their difference and relevance. To be speciﬁc,

• The derivation of Theorem 2 offered in this paper makes less assumptions (constraints) on x and G
than s and H accordingly in [21], thus, the formulation of (13) applies to more systems than (14).

• In case of high SNR (e.g., N0 is very small while d2

max and L2 − 1 care kept relatively large), the
L2−1 dominate the exponents of lower bounds in (13) and (14), respectively. Here, the
max of codewords in the L-PAM

max has tight connection with L2 − 1 because d2

constellation is (L − 1)2 that shall be close to L2 − 1 especially for large L.

• It might not be difﬁcult to explain why the condition E[khik2

B. Codebook of x for Sphere-Decoding Algorithm in High-Dimension Random Lattices

As pointed out earlier, the expected complexity of the sphere-decoding algorithm has exponential lower

bound (as in Theorem 2, or in [21, Theorem 2]) under the given assumptions. However, it is not fair to

totally ascribe the cause of the exponential complexity to the sphere-decoding algorithm. We will indicate

and draw attention to a hitherto unnoticed point on the cause of exponential complexity.

Remark 1. It is reasonable to attribute the partial cause of the exponential complexity of sphere-decoding

algorithm to the codebook of x, because ﬁrst of all, two facts shall not be ignored, which are given as

follows:

1) Letting ρ2 = αnN0 implies that the radius of SC would grow with n, while the codewords in

the codebook Cm
increases, the sphere-decoding algorithm will search for the closet lattice point in a sphere with

τ,L of (8) has the ﬁxed minimal distance whatever the value of n is. That is, as n

larger boundary; in contrast, the minimal distance of the codewords of x does not change with n.

2) The main results state that as n grows large, the distance metric kGbx + w − Gxk2
kbx − xk2

2 + nN0 so that kbx − xk2

any pair of lattices (probably corrupted by noise) while the effects of G and w gradually vanish.

2 is going to be the dominated factor of the distance between

2 tends to

From these, one can imagine that the complexity of the sphere-decoding algorithm will rise dramatically as

the dimension of lattices becomes high; during this procedure the codebook of x becomes the dominated

factor of the sphere-decoding complexity.

To simplify the presentation, let us introduce a deﬁnition that describes how the minimal distance of

the codes of x performs for high-dimension lattices.

Deﬁnition 1. Given a non-decreasing function of m, γ(m), the codebook of x is said to inﬂate with

γ(m) as m increases, if there exists one monotonically increasing function g(·) > 0, such that, ∃m′ ∈

Z ∩ (0 + ∞), for ∀m ≥ m′,

dmin(m) ≥ g(γ(m)),

where dmin(m) denotes the minimal distance of the codebook of x. Then, we say that the codebook of

x is not inﬂatable, if, for ∀m ∈ Z ∩ (0 + ∞) there exists a positive c,

14

dmin(m) ≤ c.

Remark 2. Clearly, the codebook Cm

τ,L in (8) is not inﬂatable, which in turn implies that the traditional

constellation schemes in Rayleigh-fading MIMO systems corresponds to the codebooks (of x) that are also

not inﬂatable. More suitable codebooks of x for the sphere-decoding algorithm in high-dimension random

lattices may be obtained by considering that, if the minimal distance dmin(m) of some codebooks of x can
inﬂate with the SC radius of the sphere-decoding algorithm, ρ(m), where ρ(m) = √αnN0 = √ακmN0,

then the minimal distance dmin(m) and ρ(m) can increase with m simultaneously so that the number of

lattice points satisfying the SC of the sphere-decoding algorithm might grow subexponentially or even

polynomially with m.

In what follows, the existence of a potential code scheme that inﬂates with ρ(m) will be discussed

theoretically. Let V C
1,m

embedding of V C

, {Φ ∈ Cm×1|Φ†Φ = 1} denote the (complex) Stiefel manifold. The canonical
1,m into the vector space (Cm×1, < ·,· >C) motivates the deﬁnition of the topological

‘chordal’ metric/distance d(Φ, Ψ) = kΦ − ΨkF , Φ, Ψ ∈ V C

1,m [29].

Theorem (Sphere-packing bound [29, Corollary IV.2]). For m ≫ 1, there exist a codebook CSP

where α′ is a constant coefﬁcient that can bridge the chordal distance and geodesic distance as in [29,

To fairly compare CSP

Then, (15) becomes

ρ(m) is a monotonically increasing

function of ρ(m), which is in proportion topEx/N0 but inversely proportional to √L. If the codebook

can be explicitly constructed, solving the problem (3) of the random lattices may be possible using

x

The analysis above gives a bird’s eye view of the codebook of x for the sphere-decoding algorithm

in high-dimension random lattices so far, focusing on the theoretical existence and a train of thought of

designing the proper codebook which might be able to realize the sphere-decoding algorithm in high-

dimension random lattices with subexponential or even polynomial complexity without giving rise to the

sacriﬁce of other performances. However, the ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the existence of and how to exactly

construct such a codebook are beyond the scope of this study and shall be a meaningful but challenging

future work.

C. Convergence Rate of Pairwise Error Probability (PEP) with ML Detector for A Large Number of

Antennas

Consider a multiple-antenna system with linear model y = Hx + w, where y is the received signal, x

is the transmitted signal, w is the noise vector of zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables with zero

mean and independent real and imaginary parts with the same variance N0/2, and H is the channel matrix

whose entries are independent complex Gaussian random variables, circularly distributed with variance

of their real and imaginary parts equal to 1/2n.

The PEP is the basic building block for the derivation of union bounds to the error probability of a

MIMO detector. In the considered system, the PEP with ML detector is given by

Proof: Corollary 4 is established because Q(t) is a monotonically decreasing function of t.

V. CONCLUSION

The asymptotic analysis of random lattices in high dimensions is presented to clarify the distance

properties of lattice points. These properties indicate the asymptotic value for the distance between any

pair of lattice points in high-dimension random lattices, and describe the convergence behavior of how the

asymptotic value approaches the exact distance. The asymptotic analysis further prompts to new insights

into the asymptotic behavior of sphere-decoding complexity and the pairwise error probability (PEP) with

ML detector for a large number of antennas.

A. Preliminaries

APPENDIX: PROOFS

Lemma A.1: A Gaussian random matrix G is bi-unitarily invariant, that is, the joint distribution of

its entries equals that of U GV † for any unitary matrices U and V independent of G, denoted by

U GV † d= G.

Lemma A.2: A central Wishart matrix W is unitarily invariant, i.e., the joint distribution of its entries

equals that of V W V † for any unitary matrix V independent of W , denoted by V W V † d= W .

Lemma A.3: For two matrices A and B, Tr(A†B) = Vec(A)†Vec(B), where Tr(A†B) is also known

as the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of A and B.

If z1, · · · , zk are independent real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance, then
the sum of their squares, s = Pk
k, is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution with k
degrees of freedom. This is usually denoted as s ∼ χ2

the gamma function (see [33, (2.1-111)]).

Lemma A.4: Letting θ = x/k, Chernoff bounds on the lower and upper tails of the c.d.f. of s can be

obtained [28]:

• For the cases when 0 < θ < 1 (which include all of the cases when this c.d.f. is less than half),

F (θk; χ2

k) ≤(cid:0)θe1−θ(cid:1)k/2.

• The tail bound for the cases when θ > 1, similarly, is 1 − F (θk; χ2

k) ≤(cid:0)θe1−θ(cid:1)k/2.

B. Proof of Theorem 1

We begin the proof by taking a closer look at (7).
