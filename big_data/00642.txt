We study the structure of the number projected BCS (PBCS) wave function in the particle-hole
basis, displaying its similarities with coupled clusters theory (CCT). The analysis of PBCS together
with several modiﬁcations suggested by the CCT wave function is carried out for the exactly solvable
Richardson model involving a pure pairing hamiltonian acting in a space of equally-spaced doubly-
degenerate levels. We point out the limitations of PBCS to describe the non-superconducting regime
and suggest possible avenues for improvement.

INTRODUCTION

Pairing correlations are widespread over several ar-
eas of quantum-many body physics, ranging from con-
densed matter to quantum chemistry to cold atomic
gases to atomic nuclei. The standard formalism for the
description of these correlations is through the use of
the Bardeen Cooper Schrieﬀer (BCS) approximation [1],
whereby the correlations are described by means of a co-
herent state of collective pairs that explicitly breaks the
conservation of particle number. This approach was ex-
tremely successful in the description of condensed matter
superconducting systems with a macroscopic number of
interacting electrons where ﬂuctuations in the particle
number are negligible. For systems with a fairly small
number of particles, e.g. atomic nuclei or superconduct-
ing grains, it is important to restore particle number,
through the use of the number projected BCS (PBCS)
approximation [2]. PBCS has been an especially useful
method to describe superconducting nuclei with few nu-
cleons in the valence space [3]. However, when applied
to ultrasmall superconducting grains [4] it was revealed
to be unable to describe the disappearance of supercon-
ductivity for small enough grains [5]. As a consequence
of these studies, the exact solution of the reduced BCS
Hamiltonian found by Richardson in the sixties [6] was
rediscovered [7] and exploited as a powerful benchmark
for many-body approximations. Likewise, more general
pairing Hamiltonians are exactly solvable if they can be
expressed as a linear combination of the set of integrals
that deﬁne the Richardson-Gaudin models [8]. This ex-
act solvability has enabled the test of approximate meth-
ods of treating pairing for a wide variety of systems, like
small superconducting grains [9], realistic atomic nuclei
[10–13], and more recently in quantum chemistry [14].
Such tests have illustrated that for a large enough num-
ber of active orbits and weak pairing, the PBCS approxi-
mation misses important pairing correlations, making its
use in large-scale energy density functional treatments of
ﬁnite nuclei suspect. This has led to a multitude of eﬀorts
to develop improved approximate treatments of pairing

correlations. This includes, e.g., the use of RPA methods
[11] and the use of coupled cluster methods [15, 16].

In this work we study the accuracy of the PBCS ap-
proximation in the non-superconducting regime and pro-
pose alternative methods based on a generalization of
the PBCS wave function for an improved approximate
treatment of pairing correlations. The method starts
with the PBCS wave function, which is then expanded
in the particle-hole (ph) basis.
In the PBCS approxi-
mation, each term in the series expansion is deﬁned by
the expansion coeﬃcients of a single collective pair and
furthermore the contribution of each term is prescribed.
The similarity of the PBCS wave function with the RPA
in the quasiboson approximation and with the CCT of
doubles with Seniority zero suggests several possible im-
provements that we explore in this work.

The structure of the paper is as follows.

In Section
II, we describe the PBCS approximation and several im-
provements based on the CCT. In Section III we intro-
duce the exactly solvable pairing Hamiltonian that we
use to carry out comparative tests of the various approx-
imations and then in Section IV describe the results of
this comparison and draw some conclusions. In Section
V we summarize the main results of the work and outline
some issues for future consideration.

II. THE PBCS WAVE FUNCTION IN THE

PARTICLE-HOLE BASIS

Let us consider a set of N particle pairs moving in
a space of L doubly-degenerate single-particle states i,¯i
and denote the single-particle creation and annihilation
operators associated with these states as c†
¯i and ci,
c¯i, respectively. Furthermore, we denote the operators
that create and annihilate a pair of particles in doubly-
degenerate time-reversed states i,¯i as

i , c†

P †
i = c†

i c†
¯i ,

ii†
Pi =hP †

which satisfy the usual SU (2) commutation relations

hPi, P †

ji = δij (1 − Ni) ,

where Ni = c†

i ci + c†

¯i c¯i .

hNi, P †

ji = 2δijP †

j ,

For simplicity we will restrict all our derivations to the
seniority zero (v = 0) subspace. However, the extension
to broken pairs is straightforward and does not add any
qualitative diﬀerence to our main conclusions. We start
from the BCS wave function, which in the ph basis can
be written as (see, for example, Ref. [17])

(4)
where M = N/2 is the number of pairs, NBCS is a nor-
malization constant, and the HF state corresponds to
having the lowest M orbits ﬁlled. Clearly, the BCS wave
function does not preserve particle number. Restoring
particle number in this ph representation is just a mat-
ter of selecting in the expansion of both exponential the
same number of particle creation pairs as hole destruc-
tion pairs. The ﬁnal result is:

(5)
It is important to note that this expansion in terms of
particle and hole pairs contains the inverse of the facto-
rial square. Having instead a simple factorial would lead
to an exponential form that immediately connects the
PBCS wave function to the pair coupled cluster theory
of doubles (p-CCD). In fact, we have already explored the
possibility of using these statistical coeﬃcients as varia-
tional parameters [9]. Moreover, in Ref.
[11] we com-
pared PBCS with p-CCD and with the self-consistent
RPA (SCRPA), showing that the latter approximations
describe well the weak coupling limit, but fail dramati-
cally when approaching the transition to superﬂuidity. In
order to proceed forward, we will derive the PBCS wave
function in the ph basis starting from the PBCS state
expressed as a condensate of M collective pairs, viz.

|PBCSi =

1

√NCond (cid:2)Γ†(x)(cid:3)M

| 0i , Γ†(x) =

L

Xi=1

(6)
where the norm NCond, which depends on the pair struc-
ture amplitudes xi, can be obtained straightforwardly
using the commutation relations (3) and recursive tech-
niques [9].

In the PBCS approximation, the L structure coeﬃ-
cients xi of the condensed pair are considered as vari-
ational parameters chosen to minimize the expectation
value of the hamiltonian. This approach is completely

equivalent to the usual formulation of PBCS approxima-
tion [2].

We now separate the collective pair operator Γ† into

its particle and hole components

(3)

Γ†(x) = Γ†

P (x) + Γ†

where

Γ†

P (x) =

Xp=M +1

H (x) =

The PBCS state can then be rewritten as

|PBCSi =

l (cid:19)hΓ†

|0i =
H (x)iM −l
P (x)ilhΓ†

|0i .

(8)

The next step consists in replacing the vacuum state
by the HF state of M pairs. In doing so, we employ a
trick that will be useful to rewrite the hole part of the
PBCS condensate. Namely, we express the HF state as
a condensate of M collective pairs with the same ampli-
tudes of the condensed PBCS pair, viz.

|HFi =

√NHF hΓ†

H (x)iM

|0i .

(9)

After some straightforward algebra, the PBCS wave func-
tion in the ph basis then reduces to

|PBCSi =r NHF

NCond

P (x) ΓH (1/x)il

|HFi .

(10)
This expression for the PBCS wave function is equiva-
lent to Eq. (5), displaying again the characteristic inverse
of the factorial square. Moreover, the amplitudes of the
hole destruction pair are the inverse of the amplitudes
of the collective PBCS pair. By inserting the deﬁnition
(7) for the particle and hole collective pairs, we obtain a
more transparent form of the PBCS wave function

As mentioned above the factorial square is the ﬁnger-
print of the PBCS wave function. Replacing these coeﬃ-
cients by a simple factorial allows us to deﬁne an Expo-
nential form of the wave function,

which we will explore as an alternative to the PBCS ap-
proximation.

A third alternative approach,

interpolates between
PBCS and the Exponential form by using a new vari-
ational parameter 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 in the exponent of the
factorial, such that for α = 1 we recover the Exponential
limit and for α = 2 we regain the PBCS state, viz:

Coming back to the Exponential approximation (Exp)
in Eq.
(12), we note the similarity of this wave func-
tion with p-CCD [11, 15] and the particle-particle RPA
or SRPA [18] wave functions in the quasi-boson approx-
imation, both of which have an exponential form,

|Ψi ∝

(14)

where the entries of the structure matrix Xp,h are deter-
mined diﬀerently in Coupled Cluster and in RPA. Note
that here too the statistical factor is the inverse of l!.

We should emphasize here two crucial diﬀerences be-
tween these two classes of approximation.
In the ﬁrst
place, the approximations related to the PBCS wave
function have a restricted separable form of the struc-
ture matrix Xp,h = xp/xh which deﬁnes a single con-
densed pair and therefore takes into account two-body
correlations only. p-CCD and SRPA preserve the com-
plete freedom of the structure matrix, allowing for the
inclusion of quartet correlations. The separable form of
the structure matrix permits the explicit computation
of norms and expectation values of operators and, there-
fore, the implementation of a Ritz variational theory. On
the contrary, SCRPA and p-CCD need to resort to some
approximations to evaluate expectation values, due to
the non-separability of the structure matrix. In the case
of RPA approaches this is done by means of a quasi-
boson approximation, whereas p-CCD computes expec-
tation values projectively in a subspace of zero and two
ph state. As we will see in the numerical study to follow,
the factorization of the matrix X as in PBCS approaches
leads to a poor approximation in the weak coupling limit
dominated by pairing ﬂuctuations.

III. THE EXACTLY SOLVABLE BCS

HAMILTONIAN AS A BENCHMARK MODEL

As noted in the previous section, we would like to test
the ordinary PBCS and the associated Exponential and
Variational approximations with the p-CCD approxima-
tion. Furthermore, we would like compare all of these
methods with exact results where applicable. Since the
Richardson method can be used to obtain exact solu-
tions for the reduced BCS Hamiltonian, we have chosen
to carry out the tests using such a hamiltonian acting in a
set of doubly-degenerate single particle orbits with equal
spacing, the so-called picket-fence model. We will ﬁrst
describe in a bit more detail the model and then in the
next section report results of the comparisons for a spe-
ciﬁc size of the model space, as a function of the strength
of the pairing force relative to the single-particle spacing.

The picket-fence model involves a Hamiltonian

with the equally-spaced single-particle energies given by

where the M pair energies Eβ are a particular solution
of the set of M non-linear coupled Richardson equations.
We will consider a system of N = L particles, namely half
ﬁlling, and discuss the results as a function of the pairing
strength G in units of the splitting between levels ǫ.

IV. TEST RESULTS OF THE PBCS AND

OTHER APPROXIMATE METHODS

We present here benchmark results for a model with
20 double-degenerate levels at half ﬁlling. We show in
ﬁgure 1 the relative error in the ground state correla-
tion energies with respect to the exact Richardson so-
lution for the PBCS, Exponential, Variational and p-
CCD approximations. The relative error is deﬁned as
∆E = 1 − Ec/EExact
. Results are reported in units of ǫ
for values of the pairing strength ranging from weak cou-
pling (G < Gc) to strong coupling (G > Gc), where the
critical value Gc, determined by the solution of the BCS
equations, separates the ﬂuctuation-dominated regime
with zero gap to the superconducting regime with ﬁnite
gap.

As can be seen in the ﬁgure, none of the approxima-
tions based on the PBCS wave function can describe
appropriately the weak coupling limit.

coupling (G < Gc) to strong coupling (G > Gc). Also shown
is the critical value of the pairing strength Gc in BCS approx-
imation.

the three PBCS-like approximations do not approach
smoothly the HF limit for G → 0, despite the fact that
the three approximations give the exact energy for G = 0.
This latter fact led to a wrong interpolation in the limit
of G → 0 in previous numerical studies of PBCS for this
model [11, 15]. In this limit, the dependence of the ex-
pansion coeﬃcients on the factorial behavior is irrelevant,
as shown by the three approximations converging to the
same correlation energy. Contrary to the PBCS-like ap-
proximations, p-CCD correctly describes this limit due
to the full freedom maintained in its structure matrix
X, which is needed to reproduce the pairing ﬂuctuations
that dominate in this region. However, it progressively
degrades as the system goes to the crossover region and
fails completely in the superconducting phase up to the
point at which there is no solution of the p-CCD equa-
tions. The ﬁgure also shows clearly the Ritz variational
character of the approximations based on PBCS, which
always give an upper limit to the GS energy.
In con-
trast, p-CCD severely overbinds for moderate values of
G. Within the PBCS class of approximations, the Expo-
nential approximation describes better than PBCS the
weak coupling region while PBCS is more eﬃcient in the
strong coupling region, producing the exact results in
the large G limit. As expected, the Variational approxi-
mation, which makes use of the extra degree of freedom
provided by the parameter α to interpolate between the
two approximations, gives the optimal description along
the complete crossover.

A similar pattern is observed in the canonical gaps,
shown in ﬁgure 2 for the three PBCS-like approxima-
tions and for p-CCD. The canonical gaps are deﬁned

as ∆ = GPipni(1 − ni), where the occupation proba-

gap calculated for the PBCS, Exponential, Variational and
p-CCD approximations as a function of G. We also show in
the inset the behavior of the exact gap as a function of G.

bilities ni are obtained in all cases using the Hellmann-
Feynman theorem. The canonical gaps are more sensitive
than correlation energies to the details of the wave func-
tion through their dependence on the occupation proba-
bilities. As a consequence, the deviations from the exact
gap are more pronounced than those of the correlation
energies in the ﬂuctuation-dominated regime. The Vari-
ational and PBCS approximations quickly converge to
the exact result in the superconducting region. This is
not the case for the Exponential approximation, which is
not able to reproduce either correlation energies or gaps
in the superconducting region. Similarly to the corre-
lation energies, the p-CCD gap describes correctly the
weak coupling limit, however the gap increases dramati-
cally for moderate values of G explaining the overbinding
observed in Fig. 1.

The variational parameter α deﬁned in Eq. (13) in-
terpolates between the Exponential and the PBCS wave
functions giving always the best correlation energy and
gap as a function of G. The behavior of this parameter
can be seen in Fig. 3. As is evident from the ﬁgure,
it starts with α = 1 for G = 0, and increases smoothly
across the transitional region towards the PBCS value
α = 2, which is expected for the extreme superconduct-
ing limit.

As mentioned above, the reason why the p-CCD ap-
proximation works well in the ﬂuctuation dominated re-
gion is that its structure matrix Xph is non-separable.
We can best analyze the structure of Xph in the p-CCD
approximation by diagonalizing it. Due to the ph sym-
metry of the problem at half ﬁlling, Xph is a symmetric
square matrix so that its diagonalization is equivalent to
a singular value decomposition. Figure 4 displays the
largest eigenvalue and the sum of all other eigenvalues
as a function of the pairing strength G. To facilitate
the interpretation of the ﬁgure, we have normalized the

trace of the matrix to 1. In analogy with a condensation
phenomenon, we call the largest eigenvalue Condensed
and the sum of the others Depletion. A separable matrix
would have a unique eigenvalue diﬀerent from 0. There-
fore the Depletion is a signature of correlations beyond
pairs. In particular, p-CCD takes into account quartet
correlations which seem to be essential to describe cor-
rectly the ﬂuctuation dominated regime. For increasing
pairing strength, p-CCD collapses due to its rigid expo-
nential structure.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work, we have discussed several approximate
methods for treating pairing. With atomic nuclei in

5

mind, we have focussed on methods that exactly con-
serve the particle number. Several of the methods we
considered are variational improvements to the PBCS ap-
proximation, deriving from a ph expansion of the PBCS
wave function. The other method we considered is the
non-variational p-CCD approximation.

Calculations were reported for a picket-fence model,
whereby a pure pairing force acts in a space of doubly-
degenerate equally-spaced levels. The calculations were
carried out for a typical size nuclear system of involv-
ing 20 doubly-degenerate levels and 20 nucleons.
It is
worthwhile to mention here that the accuracy of PBCS
increases with smaller size systems [19]. However, for
these sizes it is always possible to carry out an exact
diagonalization.

The model we studied exhibits a phase transition in
mean-ﬁeld BCS approximation at a critical value of the
pairing strength Gc relative to the splitting between lev-
els. In the superconducting region, both the PBCS and
the Variational approximations converge to the exact re-
sults given by the Richardson solution. In the ﬂuctua-
tion dominated region, the Exponential and Variational
approximations behave better than PBCS, but with a
non negligible error relative to the exact solution. The
pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (p-CCD) approximation is
able to reproduce the exact results in the weak-coupling
limit. This is because p-CCD exploits the complete free-
dom of the structure matrix, whereas the PBCS-related
approximations use a restricted separable form of this
matrix. While the Variational approximation produces
an improvement over PBCS around the critical strength,
it is actually worse than p-CCD for strengths below the
critical value. Indeed, in the weak-coupling limit it con-
verges to exactly the same solution as both the PBCS
and Exponential methods.

Further understanding of the behavior of these var-
ious approximate treatments of pairing correlations in
the weak-coupling limit is clearly warranted. On the one
hand, we showed that it is possible to extend variationally
PBCS by using a new parameter α that interpolates be-
tween the exponential form, seemingly the preferred one
in the weak coupling limit, to the PBCS form that pro-
vides exact results in the extreme superconducting limit.
However, this variational theory is not able to capture
completely the pairing ﬂuctuations in the weak-coupling
limit. The second ingredient required to fully describe
pairing correlations across all regimes is the use of a non-
separable structure matrix. The freedom of the struc-
ture matrix is preserved in p-CCD and particle-particle
RPA, but at the cost of using a rigid exponential ex-
pansion and diﬀerent approximate methods to evaluate
norms and expectation values and thus breaking the Ritz
variational principle. Moreover, the exponential form of
both theories prevents accurate solution around the crit-
ical region. Possible frameworks that might be able to
describe within the same formalism both phases are a
variational theory that includes quartet correlations [20]
or a non-variational theory like Coupled Cluster based on

an expansion that interpolates between the Exponential
and PBCS wave functions [21].
