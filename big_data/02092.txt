A SURVEY ON MIXED SPIN P-FIELDS

HUAI-LIANG CHANG1, JUN LI2, WEI-PING LI3, AND CHIU-CHU MELISSA LIU4

1. Gromov-Witten invariants of quintics

1 + . . . + x5

For the Fermat quintic polynomial W5 = x5

5, the counting of genus
g curves of degree d on the quintic Calabi-Yau three-fold Q = {W5 = 0} ⊂ P4
is a challenging problem in enumerative geometry. Since the seminal paper of
Candelas, dela Ossa, Green and Parkes [COGP], a modiﬁed version has been
intensively studied in string theory as well as algebraic geometry via the stable
maps of Kontsevich and virtual cycles theory developed by Li-Tian [LT] and
Behrend-Fantachi [BF].

For d, g ∈ Z, the moduli space of stable maps from genus g nodal curves to

Q of degree d is

M g(X, d) = {[f : C → X] | C nodal, g(C) = g, f∗[C] = d, Aut(f ) < ∞}.

The Gromov-Witten invariants are deﬁned as

Ng,d : = ˆ[M g(X,d)]vir

1 ∈ Q.

One of the main unsolved problems in Gromov-Witten theory is to determine

Fg(q) : =Xd

Ng,dqd.

From the Super-String Theory side, in 1991 Candelas et.al. found a closed
formula for genus zero F0(q) using T -duality and mirror symmetry ([COGP]).
In 1993, Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri and Vafa developed the Kodaira-Spencer
theory and determined the genus one F1(q) ([BCOV]). For higher genus,
in 2009 Huang, Klemm and Quackenbush determined Fg(q) for g up to 51
([HKQ]).

From the mathematical side, Kontsevich derived a torus localization to cal-
culate the genus zero GW-invariants N0,d. Givental [Gi], Lian-Liu-Yau [LLY]
determined the genus zero case F0(q). Later on, more people worked on this
topic. The genus one case F1(q) was solved in 2000’s. The second named au-
thor and Zinger in [LZ] obtained a formula N red
1,d is

N0,d where N red

1,d = N1,d −

certain reduced GW-invariants. Using this formula and C∗-localization, Zinger
in [Zi] succeeded in determining F1(q). Gathmann [Gath] provided an algo-
rithm for N1,d using the relative GW-invariant formula. For higher genus case,
Maulik and Pandharipande found an algorithm [MP, Section 3.2] using the
algebraic version of degeneration formula [Lideg] (see analogue formula [LR])
and used it for some theoretical applications. Despite these progress, a lot
of questions on higher genus GW invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds
remains open.

It remains a central problem in Gromov-Witten theory to develop new tech-
niques to calculate all genus GW-invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds.

2. Witten’s vision and FJRW invariants
2.1. Witten’s vision. The same quintic polynomial W5 = x5
5 can
also give a map C5 → C. The corresponding physical theory is the Landau-
Ginzburg theory.
In [Wi], Witten studied phase transitions involving GW
theory on the quintic Q and the LG-model for W5. Mathematically, the set-up
is as follows. Let C∗ act on

1 + . . . + x5

C6 = C5 × C = {(x1, . . . , x5, p)}

with weights (1, . . . , 1, −5). Then the map p · (x5
C∗-equivariant. The quotient [C6/C∗] has two GIT quotients:

1 + . . . + x5

5) : C6 → C is

and

(cid:0)(C5 − {~0}) × C(cid:1)/C∗ = KP4,
(cid:0)C5 × (C − 0)(cid:1)/C∗ = [C5/Z5].

Here [C5/Z5] represents the quotient stack. The ﬁeld theory valued in KP4 is
the GW theory of the quintic Q and the ﬁeld theory valued in [C5/Z5] leads
to the Witten’s spin class. The latter was generalized to quasi-homogeneous
polynomials by Fan, Jarvis and Ruan [FJR1, FJR2], which is called FJRW
theory. Witten’s vision is that these two theories are related via a phase
transition.

2.2. P-ﬁelds treatment of GW and FJRW. The notion of P-ﬁelds was
introduced by Guﬃn and Sharpe in [GS] for genus zero LG-theory of (KP4, W5).
Mathematically, The ﬁrst and second named authors developed the theory of
P-ﬁelds for all genus GW invariants.

We start with LG-theory for KP4. A ﬁeld taking values in (cid:0)(C5 − {~0}) ×
C(cid:1)/C∗ is

ξ = (C, L, ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5, ρ)

where C is a complete nodal curve, L is an invertible sheaf on C, ϕi ∈ H 0(C, L),
and ρ ∈ H 0(L∨5 ⊗ ωC). Since the weights of the action C∗ on C5 and C are
(1, . . . , 1) and −5 respectively, while ϕi is a section of L, a priori ρ has to
be a section of L∨5 , but we choose ρ to be a section of L∨5 ⊗ ωC due to a

MSP

3

technical reason. Since we deleted the origin ~0 from C5, (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5) must be
nowhere zero. Since we consider the quotient space via the C∗-action, we need
to introduce the natural equivalence (C, L) → (C, L) where C∗ acts on L via
scalar multiplication. Finally we say ξ is stable if Aut(ξ) is ﬁnite.

In fact, what we have gotten so far is a stable map to P4 with a P-ﬁeld. The

moduli space of such objects is

M g(P4, d)p = {[f, C, ρ] | [f, C] ∈ M g(P4, d), ρ ∈ H 0(C, f ∗O(5) ⊗ ωC)}.

Note that the data ([f, C], ρ) is equivalent to the data (C, L, ϕ1, · · · , ϕ5, ρ) since
the map f is equivalent to the line bundle L = f ∗O
P4(1) with ﬁve sections
(ϕ1, · · · , ϕ5) of L.

The ﬁrst and second named authors constructed the GW invariants of stable
maps with P-ﬁelds as follows. The moduli stack M g(P4, d)p, relative to the
stack D = {(C, L)}, has a perfect obstruction theory. At ξ = (C, L, ϕi, ρ), the
obstruction sheaf restricted to ξ is

Ob|ξ = H 1(L)⊕5 ⊕ H 1(L∨5 ⊗ ωC).

There exists a cosection

constructed as follows. Let

σ : Ob → O

M g(P4,d)p

( ˙ϕ1, . . . , ˙ϕ5, ˙ρ) ∈ H 1(L)⊕5 ⊕ H 1(L∨5 ⊗ ωC) = Ob|ξ.

Deﬁne σ|ξ( ˙ϕ1, . . . , ˙ϕ5, ˙ρ) : = ˙ρP5

zero, i.e., σ|ξ( ˙ϕ1, . . . , ˙ϕ5, ˙ρ) = 0 for all

i=1 ϕ5

i=1 5ϕ4

i ˙ϕi.

The degeneracy locus D(σ) of the cosection consists of ξ such that σ|ξ is

i + ρP5

˙ϕi and ˙ρ. Thus

D(σ) = {ξ ∈ M g(P4, d)p | ρ = 0 and

ϕ5
i = 0} = M g(Q, d) ⊂ M g(P4, d).

5

Xi=1

The expression of the cosection σ comes from taking the derivative of p · W5 =
p(x5
5) with respect to the time variable t where p and xi are regarded
as functions of t following physical notations.

1 + . . . + x5

Since ρ is a section, the moduli space M g(P4, d)p is not proper (when g ≥ 1)
and hence cannot be used to deﬁne invariants. However, Kiem and the second
named author [KL] developed a theory of cosection localization virtual cycles
which, applied to this case, resolves the non-proper issue. More precisely, one
checks that the degeneracy locus D(σ) is the moduli space of stable maps to
the quintic Q and thus proper.

Theorem 2.1 (H.L. Chang - J. Li [CL1]). Using the cosection localized virtual
cycle, one obtains the cycle

[M g(P4, d)p]vir

loc ∈ A∗D(σ) = A∗M g(Q, d).

Furthermore, let P-ﬁelds GW invariants N p

Ng,d = (−1)d+g+1N p

g,d = ´[M g(P4,d)p]vir

1 ∈ Q, then

The advantage of this result is that Fg(q) = Pd Ng,dqd now becomes a
topological string amplitude of a ﬁeld theory valued in KP4 =(cid:0)(C5−~0)×C(cid:1)/C∗.

Now let’s consider the ﬁeld theory valued in [C5/Z5]. This theory originated
from Witten’s spin class [Wi]. Its algebraic constructions (in narrow case) were
given by Polishchuk-Vaintrob [PV] and Chiodo [Chi]. The full theory was
developed by Fan, Jarvis and Ruan [FJR1, FJR2], known as FJRW theory.
We will touch (narrow) FJRW invariants following the construction by the
ﬁrst, second and third named authors [CLL].

As the case in the P-ﬁelds treatment of GW theory, a ﬁeld in (cid:0)C5 × (C −
0)(cid:1)/C∗ = [C5/Z5] consists of

ξ = (ΣC, C, L, ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5, ρ)

where (ΣC, C) is a pointed twisted curve with markings ΣC possibly stacky,
L is an invertible sheaf on C, ϕi ∈ H 0(L), and ρ ∈ H 0(L∨5 ⊗ ωlog
C ) with
ωlog
C = ωC(ΣC). Since we deleted the origin in C, the section ρ must be nowhere
vanishing and hence L∨5 ⊗ ωC ∼= OC, or equivalently L⊗5 ∼= ωlog
C . Therefore
(ΣC, C, L) is a 5-spin curve. (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5) give ﬁve ﬁelds. Thus we get a moduli
space of 5-spin curves with ﬁve ﬁelds:

M

1/5,5p
g,γ = {(C, ΣC, L, ϕ1, · · · , ϕ5, ρ) | ρ is nowhere zero}.

Here γ is the monodromy data: if Σ1 is a stacky marking on C, then µ5 acts on
L|Σ1 with weight γ1 = exp(2πir/5) where 0 ≤ r ≤ 4. Narrow means 0 < r ≤ 4.
If Σ1 is an ordinary marking, γ1 is taken to be 1.
1/5,5p
g,γ

, relative to the stack D =
{(ΣC, C, L)}, has a perfect obstruction theory. There exists a cosection σ : Ob →

Similar to GW case, the moduli stack M

D(σ) = {ξ ∈ M

Theorem 2.2 (H.L. Chang - J. Li - W.P. Li [CLL]). The (narrow) FJRW
invariants can be constructed using cosection localized virtual cycles of the
moduli space of spin curves with ﬁve ﬁelds:

[M

loc ∈ A∗M

This construction is an algebraic geometric version of Witten’s original con-
struction. Witten considered the moduli space of 5-spin curves (ΣC, C, L) with

MSP

5

smooth sections. For our set-up, the corresponding Witten equations are given
by

(2.1)

¯∂si + ∂xiW5(s1, . . . , s5) = 0,

i.e.,

¯∂si + 5s4

i = 0.

This is used to construct Witten’s top Chern class to deﬁne invariants on the
moduli space of 5-spin curves. From Witten’s equation, the term ¯∂si gives
the obstruction class to extend a holomorphic section. Thus the left hand side
of (2.1) gives a (diﬀerential) section of the obstruction sheaf of the moduli of
spin curves with ﬁelds. Now substitute the complex conjugate in the Witten’s
equation by the Serre duality, the LHS of (2.1) becomes the cosection.

There is an important subclass of FJRW invariants: those with the insertion
2
. Let C have k markings with all γj = ζ 2 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k where ζ =

for k + 2 − 2g = 0 mod 5.

It is shown [CLLL2] that {Θg,k}g,k determine all FJRW invariants with
descendents (for the quintic singularity), where an explicit formula will be
given in [twFJRW]. For this reason we call {Θg,k}g,k the primary FJRW
invariants.

3. Master space technique and mixed spin fields

In the previous section, we discussed the LG-ﬁeld theoretic description of
GW theory of the quintic and FJRW theory of (C5, W5). Witten’s vision is to
link these two theories via a phase transition with respect to some complexiﬁed
parameter. The approach by the authors is to develop a ﬁeld theory valued
in the master space to geometrically realize the “wall-crossings” of these two
ﬁeld theories.

3.1. Master space technique. Now we explain the master space technique
to understand the wall-crossings between KP4 and [C5/Z5].

Consider a C∗-action on C5 × C × P1, for t ∈ C∗,

(x1, . . . , x5, p, [u1, u2])t : = (tx1, . . . , tx5, t−5p, [tu1, u2]).

It has a GIT quotient

W : = (C5 × C × P1 − S)/C∗ where S : = {(xi = 0 = u1) ∪ (ρ = 0 = u2)}.
Consider a C∗-action on W and, to avoid confusions, we call this action

T -action. For t ∈ T = C∗,

(x1, . . . , x5, p, [u1, u2])t = (x1, . . . , x5, p, [tu1, u2]).

The T -ﬁxed locus is

W T = KP4×{0}a ~0 ×(cid:0)(P1 − {0, ∞})/C∗(cid:1)a[C5/Z5] × {∞}

6

HUAI-LIANG CHANG, JUN LI, WEI-PING LI, AND CHIU-CHU MELISSA LIU

where 0 = [1, 0] and ∞ = [1, 0] in P1.

Take a T -equivariant form µ on W , then we have

0 =(cid:20)ˆW

µ ∩ c1(1wt=1)(cid:21)0

where 1wt=1 is the T -linearized trivial line bundle with weight 1 and [. . .]0
means taking degree zero part in the equivariant parameter. Thus the wall-
crossing can be expressed as

ˆ[C5/Z5]

µ − ˆKP4

µ = error ="ˆ{point}

3.2. Mixed spin P-ﬁelds. Now we consider a ﬁeld theory valued in W . Sim-
ilar to the case of the ﬁeld theory of GW valued in KP4, the authors introduced
the notion of mixed spin P -ﬁelds (MSP for short) ([CLLL]). An MSP ﬁeld is

ξ = (ΣC, C, L, N, ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5, ρ, ν = [ν1, ν2]).

(ΣC, C) is a pointed twisted curve. L and N are invertible sheaves on C. L
is as before but N is new due to the extra factor P1 in the master space
technique. ϕi ∈ H 0(L) and ρ ∈ H 0(L∨5 ⊗ ωlog
C ) as before. ν1 ∈ H 0(L ⊗
N) and ν2 ∈ H 0(N). ν = [ν1, ν2] is a new ﬁeld. We also have a narrow
condition: ϕi|ΣC = 0. There are combined GIT-like stability requirements:
(ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5, ν1) is nowhere vanishing coming from excluding {(xi = 0 = u1)}
in W ; (ρ, ν2) is nowhere vanishing coming from excluding {(ρ = 0 = u2)} in
W ; and (ν1, ν2) is nowhere vanishing coming for [u1, u2] ∈ P1. We say ξ is
stable if Aut(ξ) is ﬁnite. For simplicity, we use ϕ to represent (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5).

In order to understand why the moduli space of MSP ﬁelds geometrically
contains the moduli space of stable maps with P-ﬁelds and the moduli space
of spin curves with ﬁve P-ﬁelds, we examine the moduli space of MSP ﬁelds
in details.

Let ξ be a MSP ﬁeld. When ν1 = 0, since (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5, ν1) is nowhere zero,
we must have that (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5) is nowhere zero. Since (ν1, ν2) is nowhere zero,
ν2 must be nowhere zero. Since ν2 is a section of N, N ∼= OC. There is no
restriction on ρ. Thus ξ ∈ M g(P4, d)p and we get GW theory of the quintic
Q.

When ν2 = 0, since (ρ, ν2) is nowhere zero, ρ must be nowhere vanishing.
Since ρ is a section of L∨5 ⊗ ωlog
C . Also ν1 must be
nowhere zero. Thus L ⊗ N ∼= OC, i.e., N ∼= L∨. ϕ1, . . . , ϕ5 can be arbitrary.
Thus ξ ∈ M

C , we must have L5 ∼= ωlog

1/5,5p
g,(γj ) and we get FJRW theory.

When ρ = 0 and ϕi = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 5, ν1, ν2 must be nowhere zero. Thus

N ∼= OC and L ∼= OC. Hence we get stable curves.

MSP

Theorem 3.1 ([CLLL]). The moduli stack Wg,γ,d of stable MSP ﬁelds of genus
g, monodromy γ = (γ1, . . . , γℓ) of L along ΣC, and degree d = (d0, d∞) of L⊗N
and N respectively, is a separated DM stack of locally ﬁnite type.

The moduli stack Wg,γ,d admits a natural C∗-action: for t ∈ C∗,

(ΣC, C, L, N, ϕ, ρ, ν1, ν2)t : = (ΣC, C, L, N, ϕ, ρ, tν1, ν2).

Wg,γ,d is not proper since ϕ and ρ are sections of invertible sheaves. Thus we
cannot do integrations on this stack. However, there exists a cosection of its
obstruction sheaf. Using the arguments similar to GW case and LG case, we
have the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2 ([CLLL]). The moduli stack Wg,γ,d has a C∗-equivariant perfect
obstruction theory, an equivariant cosection σ of its obstruction sheaf, and thus
carries an equivariant cosection localized virtual cycle

where W −

g,γ,d is the degeneracy locus of σ, i.e.,

In order to do integration on W −

g,γ,d, one needs it to be proper. In fact, we

have

Theorem 3.3 ([CLLL]). The degeneracy locus W −
of ﬁnite type.

g,γ,d is a proper C∗-DM stack

From the proof of the properness, we see a phenomenon which creates line
bundles’ spin structures in the LG-phase via a limit of a family of P-ﬁelds
in CY-phase. We give this phenomenon the name “Landau-Ginzburg tran-
sition”(or CY-to-LG transition).
It is under this phenomenon that FJRW
theory captures the ghosts’ contributions in GW theory (1) in the realm of
MSP moduli.

Example 3.4. The graph of ﬁxed points of W −

1,∅,(1,0).

So the curves are elliptic curves without markings, deg L = 1, and deg N = 0.
The graph type of ﬁxed points which have contributions to the computations
are of the following four types Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, Γ4:

1 A map f from a curve C to P4 or Q is called a ghost if there are positive-genus components
of C that are contracted to points by f . Over ghosts, P-ﬁelds can be nonvanishing, and such
P-ﬁelds contribute to GW invariants of the quintic as “counting ghosts”. For example, in
Li-Zinger formula N1,d = N red
N0,d, the number 1/12 comes from the contribution
by P-ﬁelds. When genus increases, such contribution is diﬃcult to locate. MSP program
provides a platform that ghosts’ contributions can be captured in another phase (LG-phase)
instead.

Figure 1. graphs for g = 1, γ = ∅, d = (1, 0).

Some explanations of the ﬁgure are in order. The bottom horizontal line
corresponds to ν1 = 0. The middle horizontal line corresponds to ϕ = 0 and
ρ = 0. The top horizontal line corresponds to ν2 = 0. A vertex represents a
connected curve if it is stable (called a stable vertex), or a node if it has two
edges, or nothing if it has only one edge attached to it. For each vertex, g
represents the genus of the curve. If it is not a stable vertex, nor a node, we
use g = 0 here even though it doesn’t represent a rational curve. An edge is
a rational curve. The number near an edge is the degree of L on the curve.
A stable vertex on the horizontal lines 0, 1, infty means ν1 = 0, ϕ = 0 = ρ, or
ν2 = 0 on the curve respectively.

To be more precise, the graph Γ1 represents an elliptic curve with degree 1
line bundle L on the curve and ν1 = 0 on the whole curve. So it corresponds to
stable maps from elliptic curves to the quintic Q with degree 1. The graph Γ2
represents a union of an elliptic curve E with a rational curve E0 intersecting
at one node. E is a stable vertex on the bottom horizontal line. E0 is the
edge. deg L is 0 on the elliptic curve and 1 on the rational curve. The graph
Γ3 is similar to Γ2, a union of an elliptic curve E and a rational curve E0
intersecting at one node. E is a stable vertex on the middle horizontal line
and E0 is the edge. On E, ϕ = 0 = ρ and both L and N are trivial. Thus it
represents the moduli space of elliptic curves with one marking coming from
the node. The graph Γ4 represents a union of two rational curves E0 and E∞
and an elliptic curve E. On the lower edge E0, deg(L|E0) = 1 and ρ|E0 = 0.
Note that on each irreducible component, either ρ = 0 or ϕ = 0. On E∞,
deg(L|E∞ ) = −1/5 and ϕ|E∞ = 0. E∞ and E0 intersect at one node. E∞ is
a twisted curve intersecting the elliptic curve E at a stacky point. Thus L|E∞
is an invertible sheaf on the twisted curve E∞. E is a spin elliptic curve with
one marking from the node. Thus deg(L|E) = 1/5.

4. Vanishing and polynomial relations

How to extract information of GW and/or FJRW invariants from the cycle
loc ? Let’s consider a less general case to illustrate key ideas. Take

[Wg,γ,d]vir
γ = ∅, i.e., no markings. Then by virtual dimension counting, we have

[Wg,d]vir

loc ∈ H C∗

2(d0+d∞+1−g)(W −

g,d, Q).

When d0 + d∞ + 1 − g > 0, letting u = c1(1|wt=1), i.e. u is the parameter for
H ∗

C∗(pt), we have

loc ]0 = 0.
Here [·]0 is the degree zero term in the variable u.

[ud0+d∞+1−g · [Wg,d]vir

Let Γ be a graph associated to ﬁxed points of the C∗-action of Wg,d and FΓ
be a connected component of W C∗
g,d of the graph type Γ. Apply the cosection
localized version proved in [CKL] of the virtual localization formula in [GP],
we have

(2) C1 to be the part of C where ϕ = 0 = ρ and hence ν1 = 1 = ν2, i.e., ν1

and ν2 are nowhere zero;

(3) C∞ to be the part of C where ν2 = 0.
Thus ξ|(connected component of C0) is in M g′,n′(P4, d′)p which gives Gromov-
Witten invariants. Here marked points appear coming from some nodes on
C0. ξ|(connected component of C1) is in M g′,n′ which gives Hodge integrals.

ξ|(connected component of C∞) is in M
g′,γ ′ which gives FJRW invariants where
γ′ appears because of some stacky nodes on C∞.

We have the following decomposition result:

[FΓ]vir

loc = cY[moduli of ξ|C0]vir

loc · [moduli of ξ|C1]vir

loc · [moduli of ξ|C∞]vir
loc

where c is a constant. The ﬁrst factor gives GW invariants of stable maps
to P4 with P -ﬁelds, i.e. Ng′,d′. The second factor gives Hodge integrals on
M g′,n′. The third factor gives FJRW invariants of insertions − 2
5 (after using a
vanishing). After e(NFΓ)’s are calculated, using the polynomial relations (4.1),
we obtain the following results about GW invariants of the quintic.

Theorem 4.1 ([CLLL2]). Letting d∞ = 0, the relations (4.1) provide an
eﬀective algorithm to evaluate GW invariants Ng,d provided the following are
known

(1) Ng′,d′ for (g′, d′) such that g′ < g, and d′ ≤ d;
(2) Ng,d′ for d′ < g;
(3) Θg′,k for g′ ≤ g − 1 and k ≤ 2g − 4;
(4) Θg,k for k ≤ 2g − 2.

Recall that Θg,k is the genus g FJRW invariants of insertions − 2

5 and Θg,k
may be non-zero only when k + 2 − 2g ≡ 0(5). We can see that when g = 2
only Θ2,2 is needed, and when g = 3 only Θ3,4 is needed.

Remark 4.2. As we know, on using mathematical induction, upon more nu-
merical datum the induction is, the less eﬀective the computation will be. We
can see from the Theorem that MSP induction for GW invariants is carried
out on two numbers, genus and the degree only. Thus this provides a rather
eﬀective way to facilitate the induction procedure.

We can also use the vanishings (4.1) to get relations among FJRW invariants.

Theorem 4.3 ([CLLL2]). Letting d = (0, d∞), the vanishings (4.1) provide
relations among FJRW invariants Θg,k.

These relations are eﬀective in calculating FJRW invariants. For example,
for the case of genus 2, {Θ2,k}k can be inductively derived from only two
unknowns Θ2,2 and Θ2,7.

For the genus 1 degree 1 case in Example 3.4, the contributions from four
graph types are (here Gi is the contribution from the graph Γi in Figure 1):

From the equation (4.1), the sum of these four numbers should be zero. Thus
we obtain N1,1 = 2875

12 which agrees with the known result.

For the genus 1 degree 2 case in Example 3.5, the contributions from 15

From the equation (4.1), the sum of the ﬁfteen numbers above being zero leads
to N1,2 = 407125/8. This is the mathematically veriﬁed number by Zinger in
[Zi].

4.1. Speculations. Let us look at Theorem 4.1 from a diﬀerent aspect. In-
ductively we may suppose all GW/FJRW invariants for genus less than g are
known. Then for genus g, Theorem 4.1 reduces the problem of determining
the inﬁnitely many GW invariants {Ng,d}∞
d=1 to two ﬁnite sets of initial datum

{Ng,1, · · · , Ng,g−1} and {Θg,k}k≤2g−2.

We formulate the following speculation:

By suitable choice of positive d0 and d∞, the relations (4.1) provide an
eﬀective algorithm to determine the ﬁrst set of initial data {Ng,1, · · · , Ng,g−1}.

If this is true, then one is left to determine the second set of initial data
{Θg,k}k≤2g−2. We propose another conjecture about fully determining all
FJRW invariants for the quintic,

12

Conjecture 4.5. The equations (4.1) using d0 = 0 and nonempty γ’s (i.e.
with markings) give relations that, together with Theorem 4.3, eﬀectively eval-
uate all Θg,k.

We have veriﬁed this conjecture for the case Θ2,2. Recall that for the case

of genus 2, this is the only undetermined invariant in Theorem 4.1.

4.2. Other approaches. The other approach to Witten’s proposal is the re-
cent work of Fan, Jarvis and Ruan [FJR3]. They worked on more general
context of gauged linear sigma model, where more general groups G were
In [FJR3, Ex.4.2.23], they took G = C∗ × C∗ and combined the
involved.
quasi-map technique with the P-ﬁelds theory to set up the moduli space. Inci-
dentally, a closed point of the moduli also consists of a pointed twisted curve
Σ ⊂ C, two line bundles L and N, and a collection of sections. We point out
that despite the similarity, the approach of [FJR3] is diﬀerent from ours.

The theory in [FJR3] uses the concept of ǫ-stability, dependent on the real
parameter ǫ, similar to the case of stable quotient [MOP]. The moduli for
ǫ = 0+ was constructed in [FJR3]; the case for GW-theory is when ǫ = +∞,
which is yet to be constructed. For ǫ = 0+ moduli space, the stability (on a
point (C, L, N, · · · )) requires that L−e1 ⊗ N−e2 is ample on those components of
C for which ωlog
C has degree zero, where 0 < e1 < e2. Coming back to Example
3.5, we see that in Γ3 of Figure 2, for the edge E connecting a genus 1 curve
E ) = 0, N|E ∼= O and deg(L|E ) = 1.
with a genus zero curve, we have deg(ωlog
Thus deg(cid:0)(L−e1 ⊗ N−e2)|E(cid:1) < 0. So curves with the graph type Γ3 in Figure

2 will not be in ǫ = 0+ moduli space of [FJR3, Ex.4.2.23].

The θ-parameter in [FJR3] may resemble the r-parameter in Witten’s vision
of CY/LQ correspondence. In out approach, we introduced the new ﬁeld ν =
[ν1, ν2] in order to “quantize” the Witten’s parameter in his phase transition
between Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzberg theories. We believe that MSP ﬁeld
theory will provide a mathematical theory to realize the vision of Witten. We
hope that both approaches will be useful for eventual understanding of CY/LG
correspondence in realizing Witten’s vision that “along a suitable path, there
may well be a sharply deﬁned phase transition,”

Another approach is by Choi and Kiem. In [ChK], they introduced the mod-
uli spaces of ǫ-stable quasi-maps with P-ﬁelds similar to [FJR3] and introduced
additional δ-stability to make each wall-crossing more manageable.
