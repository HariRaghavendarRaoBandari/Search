Abstract

Motivated by recent experiments we study theoretically the dynamics of vortices in the crossover

from two to one-dimension in atomic condensates in elongated traps. We explore the transition

from the dynamics of a vortex to that of a dark soliton as the one-dimensional limit is approached,

mapping this transition out as a function of the key system parameters. Moreover, we probe this

transition dynamically through the hysteresis under time-dependent deformation of the trap at the

dimensionality crossover. When the solitonic regime is probed during the hysteresis, signiﬁcant

angular momentum is lost from the system but, remarkably, the vortex can re-emerge.

Introduction. Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) provide rich insight into su-

perﬂuidity, buoyed by their purity and immense ability to control and image the coherent

matter wave [1]. Of particular interest are coherent macroscopic excitations in the form

of quantized vortices [2, 3] and dark solitons [4]. Quantized vortices represent defects in

the quantum mechanical phase about which the superﬂuid ﬂows with quantized circulation

and appear point-like in 2D and as vortex lines or rings in 3D. Early landmark demon-

strations of single vortices [5, 6], vortex arrays and lattices [7–9] and vortex rings [10] have

been supplemented more recently by the deterministic generation of vortex dipoles [11, 12],

real-time observation of vortex dynamics [13] and turbulent states of disordered vortices

[14–16]. Meanwhile, atomic dark solitons are one-dimensional, non-dispersive matter waves

characterized by a notch in the atomic density and a nontrivial phase slip [4, 17]. They

are favored under repulsive s-wave atomic interactions, which gives rise to the required de-

focussing mean-ﬁeld nonlinearity. Experiments have controllably generated dark solitons

[18–26], including long-lived solitons at ultralow temperatures in tightly-1D geometries [23]

and studied their oscillations, interactions and collisions [23, 25, 26].

Dark solitons and vortices are formally distinct objects with diﬀering dimensionalities and

topological properties; vortices can only disappear at a boundary or by annihilating with an

opposite-circulation vortex, while dark solitons have no such constraint. In a harmonic trap,

a dark soliton tends to oscillate axially at a ﬁxed proportion of the trap frequency [27–30]

while a vortex precesses about the trap center at a frequency with a non-trivial dependence

on its position and system parameters [31–35]. Remarkably, however, dark solitons and

vortices show many analogous behaviors – underpinned by their common nature as phase

defects – such as their spontaneous creation under the Kibble-Zurek mechanism [36–38],

their emergence during the breakdown of superﬂow [11, 16, 22, 39–41], their instability to

acceleration [42, 43] and their interaction with phonons [44, 45].

The intimate connection between vortices and dark solitons is perhaps best revealed

at the dimensionality crossover. While dark solitons are dimensionally stable in quasi-1D

geometries [46], 3D dark solitons are unstable to transverse perturbations; the nodal line

undergoes the snake instability (known from earlier studies in optics [47]) and decays into

one or more vortex rings (or vortex-antivortex pairs in 2D) [10, 20, 48, 49]. Close to the 1D

boundary, hybrid dark soliton-vortex ring excitations have been observed [50]. Theoretical

analysis of the possible solutions conﬁrmed this behavior but also predicted the existence of

2

solitonic vortex solutions [51, 52], that is, a single vortex conﬁned to move along the long

axis. This excitation is predicted to be favored when the transverse size is large enough

to make the dark soliton unstable but not so large as to support vortex rings. In recent

experiments these solitonic vortices have been reported in both Bose [53, 54] and Fermi gases

[55].

Motivated by these recent experiments we examine the crossover from vortices to solitonic

vortices in trapped condensates. Based on numerical simulations of the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii

(GP) equation, we investigate the propagation of the vortex/solitonic vortex in static traps

with diﬀering aspect ratios. We map out how the oscillation frequency of the excitation

changes with the trap ratio; as the latter increases, this frequency saturates to that expected

for a dark soliton, marking the onset of the solitonic vortex regime. This occurs when the

transverse harmonic oscillator length becomes roughly equal to twice the healing length (the

characteristic size of the vortex). Furthermore, we examine the dynamics in traps with time-

dependent trap ratio, exploring the hysteresis across the vortex/solitonic vortex crossover.

We ﬁnd that observable deviations of the angular momentum from its initial value can occur

if the vortex/solitonic vortex limit is crossed.

Theoretical model. We consider a weakly-interacting BEC at zero temperature, com-

posed of atoms of mass m and conﬁned by a harmonic potential V (x, y, z) = 1

xx2 +
z z2), where ωx,y,z are the trap frequencies in the respective directions. The atomic
yy2 + ω2
ω2
interactions are modelled by the contact pseudopotential g0δ(r − r(cid:48)), where g0 = 4π¯h2as/m
and as is the atomic s-wave scattering length. For simplicity we adopt a 2D model. The

2m(ω2

trapping along z is assumed suﬃciently strong to render the condensate dynamics as quasi-

two-dimensional [56]. Then, the 2D condensate wave function ψ(x, y, t) (normalized to the

total particle number N ) satisﬁes the eﬀective 2D GP equation

Evolution for various aspect ratios. To illustrate the crossover from vortices to solitonic

vortices, Fig. 1 shows the condensate evolution (density and phase) under three diﬀerent trap

ratios, with the vortex initially at (xV,0, yV,0) = (1.5lx, 0). For a circular trap (ωy/ωx = 1) and

a weakly elongated trap (ωy/ωx = 4), the vortex precesses in a circular and elliptical path,

respectively. This is to be expected since, in the absence of thermal dissipation, vortices

follow equipotential trajectories [57], which can be understood in terms of the Magnus force

acting on the vortex due to the inhomogeneous density. The vortex maintains a circular

core and a 2π corkscrew phase proﬁle. For considerably higher trap ratio (ωy/ωx = 15),

however, the initially-imprinted vortex rapidly deforms into a stripe-like density depression,

and the phase proﬁle becomes more step-like (with a rapid variation at the poles and almost

uniform at the sides). As we will show, this structure behaves as a solitonic vortex.

To assess how vortex-like or soliton-like the excitation is, we monitor its oscillation fre-
quency, ωV . The excitation’s trajectory {xV (t), yV (t)} is tracked according to its density
minimum [58]; ωV is determined from the Fourier frequency spectrum of xV (t). A single

vortex is predicted to precess with a relatively small frequency which depends non-trivially

on its position, the trap frequencies and the atomic interactions [59], as predicted using

asymptotic expansions [31, 32] and variational techniques [33, 34]. Meanwhile, for a 1D
condensate in the Thomas-Fermi (TF) limit (N as/lx (cid:29) 1), a dark soliton is expected to

simulations with varying trap ratio. For each interaction strength g considered, ωV is seen

√
frequency ωS = ωx/

to increase with trap ratio ωy/ωx, saturating at a value close to the expected dark soliton
2 (blue dashed line). This demonstrates the soliton-like behavior of the
√
excitation for suﬃciently high trap ratios. Note that ωV does not exactly tend to ωx/

2;

this prediction assumes the one-dimensional and TF limits. Away from these limits the

soliton frequency can deviate by up to 10% [46], consistent with our observations.

It is evident from Fig. 2(a) that, for higher g values, the solitonic limit requires higher trap

ratios. It is expected that the solitonic (quasi-1D) limit is reached when the transverse size

√
of the system becomes of the order of the healing length, ξ = ¯h/

2mg, which characterizes
√
the size of the vortex [51]. Since the healing length scales as 1/
g, for larger values of

g tighter conﬁnement in y is required to reach this limit. We formalize this criterion as

follows. In the TF approximation, density gradients are neglected and the resulting density

This is plotted as a function of trap ratio in Fig. 2(a) (inset). Upon plotting the oscillation

frequency ωV as a function of ly/ξ (rather than trap ratio), the data fall onto a common
curve [Fig. 2(b)]. Moreover, the solitonic limit is commonly reached when ly/ξ <∼ 2 (shaded
region). One may instead deﬁne the transverse condensate as the scaled TF radius Ry/ξ

[inset of Fig. 2(b)]; again the data fall onto a common curve, with the solitonic limit reached
for Ry/ξ <∼ 5 (shaded region).

In the 2D regime (ly/ξ (cid:29) 2) the excitation should behave as a true 2D vortex. Using
a variational Lagrangian method in the TF limit, Kim and Fetter [59] predicted ellipti-

cal vortex trajectories under non-axisymmetric 2D harmonic conﬁnement, governed by the
equations ˙xV (t) = −(ωy/ωx)ωV yV (t) and ˙yV (t) = (ωx/ωy)ωV xV (t), where the precession

with the present simulated vortex dynamics up to moderate trap ratios, beyond which ωV

is underestimated [solid lines, Fig 2(a)]. This diﬀerence is likely due to both the deviation

from a TF state as the trap ratio increases, and also the breakdown of the assumption of a

vortex phase proﬁle used for the variational ansatz that underlies Eq. (4).

Figure 2(c) shows the oscillation frequency for diﬀerent initial vortex positions, xV,0 =
{1, 2, 3}lx, at ﬁxed interaction strength, g = 400 (for comparison, Rx ≈ 5lx). The data have

5

a similar behavior for all three positions, with the curves shifting up slightly compared to

the prediction of Eq. (4) for increasing xV,0. The solitonic limit is reached at a similar trap
ratio, ωy/ωx ≈ 20. Good agreement with the Eq. (4) is found for vortices placed close to the
trap center, but worsens for vortices placed oﬀ-center. This is to be expected since oﬀ-center

vortices probe more of the non-TF tails of the condensate. Importantly, the insensitivity

of the solitonic limit to the vortex position serves to emphasize the primary role of the

condensate aspect ratio (quantiﬁed via ly/ξ or Ry/ξ in this work) in controlling the eﬀective

dimensionality of the excitation.

Evolution under trap deformation. We now turn our attention to the fate of the vortex

in a trap that is dynamically deformed from an initially axisymmetric geometry to a highly

elongated (along x) one and back again, seeking to address the persistence of the vortex

and the hysteresis of the system. ωy is made time-dependent so as to evolve the trap ratio
ωy(t)/ωx as per Fig. 3(a): after an initial wait (16ω−1
x , approximately one vortex precession
period for g = 100), the trap ratio is ramped linearly to a maximum value ε over time tramp,
held there for thold, and then linearly reduced back to an axisymmetric trap over t(cid:48)

ramp.

An example case, with maximum trap ratio ε = 8 and g = 100, is shown in Fig. 3(b).

By comparison to Fig. 2(a) it is evident that, for this maximum trap ratio, the system

enters the solitonic regime. It is useful to characterize the system through its total angular
momentum, found from the expectation value Lz = −i¯h(cid:104)ψ|x∂y − y∂x|ψ(cid:105) of the z-component
angular momentum operator. The evolution of Lz for this system is shown in Fig. 4(a)

(left column, pink line). As the trap ratio is increased, the precessing vortex deforms into

a 1D-like solitonic vortex, which oscillates axially. During the increase of the trap ratio Lz

decreases. Upon reducing the trap ratio, the vortex is remarkably seen to re-emerge in the

system, albeit with increased radial position. Concurrent with this, the angular momentum

rises again, saturating at a value which is about one third of its initial value, consistent with

the drift of the vortex to the edge. The time-dependent anisotropy of the system couples
with the system’s nonzero angular momentum Lz resulting in a smaller value of |Lz| than
the initial one. The condensate also develops considerable surface excitations during the

deformation process.

The gray dotted line is the variation in the total energy of the system (energy at time

t divided by the energy at equilibrium), here out of scale. In all cases studied, the total

energy increased up to a value that follows ∼ √

ε and then returned to a value, marginally

6

(∼ 0.2 − 2%) higher than the initial one, making thus the whole process a non-violent one.
Since the vortex energy accounts only for 8 − 10% of the total energy (depending on the
vortex position) this comes to no surprise. We conclude that the hysteresis loop aﬀects the

angular momentum but not (signiﬁcantly) the energy.

For an adiabatically-slow deformation of the trap, Lz should depend on the instantaneous

trap ratio only. It is clear here, however, that angular momentum is lost from the vortex

during the dynamics, giving rise to a hysteresis eﬀect. This is revealed by plotting a hysteresis

curve of Lz versus trap ratio in Fig. 4(a) (right column, pink line); arrows denote the direction

of time.

We next make a systematic study of how the key physical parameters - vortex initial

position, ramping rate, interactions and maximum trap ratio - aﬀect the ﬁnal state of the

vortex and its hysteresis. The results are shown in Fig. 4(a)-(d). We vary each of these

quantities in turn, while keeping the remaining parameters ﬁxed (with values stated in the

ﬁgure caption).

(a) Vortex position: We consider four initial vortex positions, xV,0 = {0.1, 1, 1.5, 2}lx and
yV,0 = 0. For comparison, the (axisymmetric) TF radius is Rx = 3.4lx. The loss in

angular momentum increases for a vortex positioned away from the trap center. Indeed,
for positions >∼ 0.6 Rx, the remaining angular momentum is negligible, and no vortex
persists. Conversely, for a vortex initially placed close to the trap center, the vortex

remains intact, the system recovers its original angular momentum, and undergoes an

almost time-symmetric hysteresis.

(b) Deformation rate: We consider a slow deformation (tramp = 105ω−1
moderate deformation (tramp = 70ω−1
27ω−1
greater than the vortex periods.

x , thold = 40ω−1
x ),
x ) and fast deformation (tramp =
x ). Note that the deformation cycles employed here are on timescales

x , thold = 20ω−1

x , thold = 40ω−1

From the same initial value, the angular momentum drops at diﬀerent rates. Slower

deformation appears to result in an increased loss in Lz. However, we cannot say whether

this is due to the diﬀerent ramp rates, diﬀerent hold times or both.

(c) Interaction: For moderate interactions (g = 100), angular momentum is lost during

the process, while for strong (g = 200) and very strong interactions (g = 400) almost no

7

angular momentum is lost and the hysteresis curve is time-symmetric. This diﬀerence is

attributed to the diﬀerent dimensionalities probed - for moderate interactions this system

crosses the border into the solitonic regime, while for the strong and very strong cases the

system remains eﬀectively 2D throughout. This is seen by comparison to Fig. 2 (a).

(d) Maximum trap ratio: Lastly, we compare diﬀerent maximum trap ratios, ε =
{2, 3, 5, 8}. For given interaction strength (g = 100) these values lie around the tran-
sition from 2D to solitonic regime [see Fig. 2(a)], and it is not surprising that the loss in

angular momentum becomes larger for larger values of ε, i.e. as the solitonic regime is

increasingly entered.

Conclusions. We explored the fate of vortices in highly elongated traps. By monitoring

the precession frequency of the excitation, we mapped out the transition from vortex to

solitonic-vortex, as a function of the key system parameters (trap anisotropy, interaction

strength and vortex position). The frequency increases with the anisotropy and approaches
√
the value ωS ≈ ωx/

2, characteristic of the dark soliton oscillation.

Depending on the ratio of the healing length to the oscillator length and the initial position

(initial angular momentum), the solitonic vortex will survive a continuous deformation of

the trap and reappear as a vortex once the symmetry of the trap is restored (see Fig. 3),

although signiﬁcant angular momentum can be lost if the solitonic regime is entered.

Deforming and re-symmetrizing the trap that contains a solitonic vortex can be used to

probe physics in scales smaller than the healing length, currently considered inaccessible to

experimentalists, and could assist in current research in quantum turbulence [61] where the

participation of several length scales is required.

Last, we mention that beyond mean-ﬁeld descriptions have recently revealed how, in par-

ticular cases, quantized vorticity concurs with non trivial correlations and loss of coherence

[62–64]. It would be interesting to extend the present studies to fragmented condensates as

well.

Appendix. For the static trap simulations, the GP equation is evolved numerically using a

Crank-Nicolson scheme on a spatial grid with typical spacing ∆x = 0.05lx. The initial state

[featuring a vortex at (xV,0, yV,0)] is found by imaginary time propagation of the GP equation
[65] while enforcing a vortex phase defect φV(x, y) = arctan[(y−yV,0)/(x−xV,0)]. Meanwhile,

for the time-dependent simulations, the initial state is deﬁned as ψbackA(x, y)eiφV(x,y), with

state (found by imaginary-time propagation). The parameters δ, σx, σy, which determine the

A =

shape of the vortex, are determined by energy minimization. The system is evolved using

the MCTDH-X package [66], taking N = 100 and M = 1.

FIG. 1. (color online) Evolution of the condensate (i) density and (ii) phase proﬁles for trap ratios

(a) ωy/ωx = 1, (b) 4 and (c) 15. We take g = 400, and the vortex initial position (xV,0, yV,0) =

(1.5lx, 0). From left to right the columns represent t = 0, TV /4, TV /2 and 3TV /4, where TV =

2π/ωV is the vortex precession period [calculated from Eq. (4)].

FIG. 2. (color online) (a) Vortex/solitonic vortex oscillation frequency ωV versus trap ratio ωy/ωx

for interaction strengths g = 100 (blue), 200 (red) and 400 (magenta), according to simulations

(markers) and Eq. (4) (lines). The inset shows the relationship between ly/ξ and the trap ratio.

The vortex is started at (xV,0, yV,0) = (1.5lx, 0). Shading indicates the solitonic regime. (b) As in

(a) but with ωV plotted versus ly/ξ, and also versus Ry/ξ (inset). (c) Oscillation frequency versus

trap ratio for diﬀerent initial positions xV,0, as per the legend (and g = 400). The black dashed

√
lines indicate the predicted soliton frequency ωS = ωx/

deformation of the trap ratio. (b) Evolution of the condensate density during a hysteresis protocol

from axisymmetric to elongated and back again. Here g = 100, (xV,0, yV,0) = (1.5, 0)lx, ε = 8,

FIG. 4. (color online) Angular momentum per particle, Lz, versus time (left) and versus the trap

ratio ωy/ωx (right). From (a) to (d) we show diﬀerent initial vortex positions, deformation rates,

interaction strengths and maximum trap anisotropy. For the Lz(ωy/ωx) hysteresis curves, the data
are smoothed with Bezier curves. Unless varied, the parameter values are g = 100, tramp = 70ω−1
x ,
xV,0 = 1.5lx and ε = 8. The gray line (triangle-dotted, here out of scale) of the top left panel shows

the relative increase of the total energy of the system E/E(t = 0) that grows as large as 3. See

text for details.
