SYMMETRIC KRONECKER PRODUCTS AND

SEMICLASSICAL WAVE PACKETS

GEORGE A. HAGEDORN AND CAROLINE LASSER

Abstract. We investigate the iterated Kronecker product of a square matrix
with itself and prove an invariance property for symmetric subspaces. This
motivates the deﬁnition of an iterated symmetric Kronecker product and the
derivation of an explicit formula for its action on vectors. We apply our result
for describing a linear change in the matrix parametrization of semiclassical
wave packets.

1. Introduction

The Kronecker product of matrices is known to be ubiquitous [VL00], and our
aim here is to investigate the n-fold Kronecker product of a complex square matrix
M ∈ Cd×d with itself,

M n⊗ = M ⊗ ··· ⊗ M
}

{z

n times

|

,

n ∈ N,

and to apply our ﬁndings to the parametrization of semiclassical wave packets.

1.1. Two-fold symmetric Kronecker products. In semideﬁnite programming
(See for example [AHO98] or [Kle02, Appendix E].), the two-fold Kronecker prod-
uct has notably occurred in combination with subspaces of a particular symmetry
property. One considers the space

X2 = nx ∈ Cd2

: x = vec(X), X = X t ∈ Cd×do ,
that contains those vectors that can be obtained by the row-wise vectorization of
a complex symmetric d × d matrix. The dimension of the space X2 is

L2 = 1

2 d (d + 1).

One can prove that this space is invariant under Kronecker products, in the sense
that for all matrices M ∈ Cd×d, one has

(M ⊗ M ) x ∈ X2, whenever x ∈ X2.

Now one uses the standard basis of Cd2
for constructing an orthonormal basis of
the subspace X2 and deﬁnes a corresponding sparse L2 × d2 matrix P2 that has
the basis vectors as its rows. The symmetric Kronecker product of M with itself is
then the L2 × L2 matrix

S2(M ) = P2 (M ⊗ M ) P ∗2 .

1.2. n-fold symmetric Kronecker products. How does one extend this con-
struction to symmetrizing n-fold Kronecker products? It is instructive to revisit
the second order space in two dimensions and to write a vector x ∈ X2 as

x = (x(2,0), x(1,1), x(1,1), x(0,2))t.

This labelling uses the multi-indices k = (k1, k2) ∈ N2 with k1 + k2 = 2 in the
redundant enumeration

ν2 = ((2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2))t .

This description allows for a straightforward extension to higher order n and di-
mension d. One works with a redundant enumeration νn of the multi-indices
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈ Nd with k1 + ··· + kd = n, and deﬁnes

And again, we can prove invariance in the sense that for all M ∈ Cd×d

M n⊗n x ∈ Xn, whenever x ∈ Xn.
See Proposition 2. Then, we use the standard basis of Cdn
to build an orthonormal
basis of Xn and assemble the corresponding sparse Ln × dn matrix Pn. All this
motivates the deﬁnition of the n-fold symmetric Kronecker product as

Sn(M ) = Pn M n⊗ P ∗n .

The matrix Sn(M ) is of size Ln × Ln and inherits structural properties as invert-
ibility or unitarity from the matrix M . See Lemma 4.

Our main result Theorem 1 provides an explicit formula for the action of the
matrix Sn(M ) in terms of multinomial coeﬃents and powers of the entries of the
original matrix M . Labelling the components of a vector y ∈ CLn by multi-indices
of order n, we obtain for all k ∈ Nd with |k| = n that

where m1, . . . , md ∈ Cd denote the row vectors of M . The summations weighted
with multinomial coeﬃcients stem from the n-fold Kronecker product M n⊗, whereas
the square roots of the factorials originate in the orthonormalization of the row vec-
tors of the matrix Pn.

1.3. Application to semiclassical wave packets. Our interest in n-fold sym-
metric Kronecker products emerged when studying linear changes in the para-
metrization of semiclassical wave packets. Semiclassical wave packets have ﬁrst
been proposed in [Hag85] as a multivariate non-isotropic generalization of the Her-
mite functions. See also [Hag98]. A family of semiclassical wave packets

(cid:8)ϕk[A, B] : k ∈ Nd(cid:9)

SYMMETRIC KRONECKER PRODUCTS AND

SEMICLASSICAL WAVE PACKETS

3

is parametrized by two invertible matrices A, B ∈ GL(d, C) and forms an orthonor-
mal basis of the Hilbert space of square integrable functions.
More recently, semiclassical wave packets have been also used for the numerical
discretization of semiclassical quantum dynamics by E. Faou, V. Gradinaru, and
C. Lubich [FGL09, Lub08]. The computationally demanding step of this method
is the assembly of the Galerkin matrix for the potential function V : Rd → R
according to

hϕk[A, B], V ϕl[A, B]i = ZRd

ϕk[A, B](x) V (x) ϕl[A, B](x) dx.

In an eﬀort to develop a new variant [BGH] that performs the quadrature for
semiclassical wave packets with diﬀerent parametrizing matrices A′, B′, the search
began for the matrices describing a linear change in the parametrization. Our main
application is Corollary 1 in Section 5.4. It gives an explicit formula in terms of an
n-fold symmetric Kronecker product.

1.4. Organization of the paper. In the next Section,we start with some com-
binatorics for explicitly relating the lexicographic enumeration of multi-indices of
order n with the redundant enumeration νn. Then we introduce the symmetric
subspaces Xn in Section 3 and construct an orthonormal basis together with the
corresponding matrix Pn. In Section 4, we deﬁne the n-fold symmetric Kronecker
product and prove our main result Theorem 1. An introduction to semiclassical
wave packets and the description of linear changes in their parametrization by sym-
metric Kronecker products is given in Section 5.

1.5. Notation. On some occasions we shall use the binomial coeﬃcient

(cid:18)n
j(cid:19) =

n!

(n − j)! j!

,

for non-negative integers n ≥ j.

We write a multi-index k ∈ Nd as a row vector k = (k1, . . . , kd). We use the
modulus |k| = k1 + ··· + kd, and the multinomial coeﬃcient
for k ∈ Nd.

|k|!

,

(cid:18)|k|
k(cid:19) =

We adopt the convention that any multinomial coeﬃcient with any negative argu-
ment is deﬁned to be 0. We also use the kth power of a vector,

k1! ··· kd!

xk = xk1
1

··· xkd
d ,

x ∈ Cd.

2. Combinatorics

2.1. Reverse Lexicographic ordering. First we enumerate the set multi-indices
of order n in d dimensions,

(cid:8)k ∈ Nd : |k| = n(cid:9) ,

n ∈ N,

in reverse lexicographic ordering and collect them as components of a formal vector
denoted by ℓn. The length of the vector ℓn is the binomial coeﬃcient

Ln = (cid:18)n + d − 1

n

(cid:19)

One can think of this in the following way [JHT]: The multi-indices k of order n in
d dimensions are in a one-to-one correspondence with the sequences of n identical
balls and d − 1 identical sticks. The sticks partition the line into d bins into which

4

GEORGE A. HAGEDORN AND CAROLINE LASSER

one can insert the n balls. (The ﬁrst bin is to the left of all the sticks, and contains
k1 balls; the last bin is to the right of all the sticks, and contains kd balls; for
2 ≤ j ≤ d − 1, the jth bin is between sticks j − 1 and j, and it contains kj balls.)
E.g., the multi-index (3, 2, 0, 1) in four dimensions corresponds to

•

• •

| • •

|

| •.

If all these objects were distinguishable, there would be (n + d − 1)! permutations,
but since the balls are all identical, one must divide by n!, and since the sticks are
all identical, one must divide by (d − 1)!.
2.2. A redundant enumeration. Next we redundantly enumerate and collect
multi-indices of modulus n in a vector νn of length dn. We proceed recursively and
set ν0 = ((0, . . . , 0))t,

ν1 = (e∗1, . . . , e∗d)t, and

νn+1 = vec


νn(1) + e∗1

...

. . .

νn(dn) + e∗1

...

νn(1) + e∗d

. . .

νn(dn) + e∗d




,

n ≥ 0,

where e1, . . . , ed ∈ Cd are the standard basis vectors of Cd, and vec denotes the
row-wise vectorization of a matrix.

For example, for d = 2, we have

ν2 = ((2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2))t ,
ν3 = ((3, 0), (2, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3))t .

2.3. A partition. For relating the lexicographic and the redundant enumeration,
we deﬁne the mapping

σn : {1, . . . , Ln} → P({1, . . . , dn})

so that for all i ∈ {1, . . . , Ln} and j ∈ {1, . . . , dn} the following holds:

j ∈ σn(i) ⇐⇒ νn(j) = ℓn(i).

For example, for d = 2, we have

σ2(1) = {1},

σ2(2) = {2, 3},

σ2(3) = {4}

and

σ3(1) = {1},

σ3(2) = {2, 3, 5},

σ3(3) = {4, 6, 7},

σ3(4) = {8}.

We observe the following partition property.

Lemma 1. We have

#σn(i) = (cid:18) n

ℓn(i)(cid:19),

i = 1, . . . , Ln,

σn(i) = {1, . . . dn}, where the union is pairwise disjoint.

and [i=1, ..., Ln

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that we have a partition property. For any j ∈ {1, . . . , dn}
there exists i ∈ {1, . . . , Ln} so that νn(j) = ℓn(i). So, we clearly have

[i=1,...,Ln

σn(i) = {1, . . . , dn}.

Moreover, since j ∈ σn(i) ∩ σn(i′) is equivalent to ℓn(i) = ℓn(i′), that is, i = i′, the
union is disjoint.
For proving the claimed cardinality, we argue by induction. For n = 0, we have

ℓ0 = ((0, . . . , 0)) = ν0,

σ0(1) = {10},

#σ0(1) = 1.

For the inductive step, we observe that in the redundant enumeration νn, the

multi-index k = (k1, . . . , kd) can be generated from d possible entries in νn−1,

(k1 − 1, k2, . . . , kd), . . . , (k1, . . . , kd−1, kd − 1)

by adding e∗1, . . . , e∗d, respectively. Of course, such an entry only belongs to νn−1
if all its components are non-negative. For each of these indices with all entries
non-negative, there is a unique number j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Ln−1}, such that ln−1(j) is
the given index. If one of these indices has a negative entry, we deﬁne j = −1 and
σn−1(−1) to be the empty set, i.e.,

σn−1(−1) = {}, whose cardinality is 0.

We list the d numbers deﬁned this way as i1, . . . , id, and note that all the positive
values in this list must be distinct. Then,

#σn(i) =

We next analyze the symmetric spaces

3. Symmetric subspaces

(cid:3)

n ∈ N.
We have X0 = C and X1 = Cd, whereas Xn is a proper subset of Cdn

if νn(j) = νn(j′)o ,

Xn = nx ∈ Cdn

: xj = xj ′

for n ≥ 2.

6

GEORGE A. HAGEDORN AND CAROLINE LASSER

For example, for d = 2,

X2 = (cid:8)x ∈ C4 : x2 = x3(cid:9) ,
X3 = (cid:8)x ∈ C8 : x2 = x3 = x5, x4 = x6 = x7(cid:9) .

Any vector x ∈ Xn has dn components, but the components that correspond
to the same multi-index in the redundant enumeration νn(1), . . . , νn(dn) have the
same value. Hence, at most Ln components of x ∈ Xn are diﬀerent. They may be
labelled by the multi-indices ℓn(1), . . . , ℓn(Ln), and we often refer to them by

xℓn(i),

i = 1, . . . , Ln.

The symmetric subspace X2 has also been considered in [VLV15], and we next

relate the alternative second order constructions to ours.

3.1. The second order space. The second order subspace

can also be described in terms of matrices. Since

e∗1 + e∗d

we may write

Alternatively, as in [VLV15, §2.3], one may permute the standard basis vectors
e1, . . . , ed2 ∈ Cd2

Πdd = (cid:0)e1+0·d, e1+1·d, . . . , e1+(d−1)·d, . . . , ed+0·d, ed+1·d, . . . , ed2(cid:1)

and characterize the symmetric subspace as

X2 = nx ∈ Cd2

: Πdd x = xo .

This way of writing the second order subspace corresponds to the deﬁnition of
symmetric tensor spaces by permutations as given in [Hack12, Chapter 3.5].

3.2. Relation between the subspaces. Due to the recursive deﬁnition of the
redundant multi-index enumeration, the symmetric subspaces of neighboring order
can be related to each other as follows.

Lemma 2. The symmetric subspace Xn+1 is contained in the d-ary Cartesian
product of the symmetric subspace Xn,

Proof. We decompose a vector

Xn+1 ⊆ Xn × ··· × Xn,

n ∈ N.

into d subvectors with dn components each. The dn+1 components of x can be
labelled by the multi-indices

x = (x(1), . . . , x(d))t ∈ Xn+1

νn(1) + e∗1, . . . , νn(dn) + e∗1, . . . , νn(1) + e∗d, . . . , νn(dn) + e∗d,

so that the components of the subvector x(m), m = 1, . . . , d, can be labelled by

Hence, x(m)

if νn(j) = νn(j′), and x(m) ∈ Xn for all m = 1, . . . , d.

(cid:3)

The two-dimensional example X1 = C2 and X2 = {x ∈ C4 : x2 = x3} shows

that the inclusion of Lemma 2 is in general not an equality.

3.3. An orthonormal basis. We now use the standard basis of Cdn
an orthonormal basis of Xn.
Lemma 3. Let e1, . . . , edn be the standard basis vectors of Cdn
vectors

to construct

, and deﬁne the

pi =

i = 1, . . . , Ln.

p#σn(i) Xj∈σn(i)

Then, {p1, . . . , pLn} forms an orthonormal basis of the space Xn.
Proof. For all i = 0, . . . , Ln and j, j′ = 1, . . . , dn, we have
if j ∈ σn(i),
otherwise.

(pi)j = (cid:26) (#σn(i))−1/2,

0,

Since j ∈ σn(i) if and only if νn(j) = ℓn(i), we have

(pi)j = (pi)j ′

if

νn(j) = νn(j′),

and thus pi ∈ Xn. We also observe, that for all i, i′ = 1, . . . , Ln,

Hence, the vectors p1, . . . , pLn are orthonormal. Moreover, for all x ∈ Xn, we have

hpi, pi′i =

We summarize some properties of the matrix Pn and of its adjoint P ∗n and

calculate explicit formulas for their actions on vectors.
Proposition 1. The Ln × dn matrix Pn and its adjoint P ∗n satisfy

Pn P ∗n = IdLn×Ln,

range(P ∗n ) = Xn.

Moreover, for all x ∈ Xn,

(Pn x)i = s(cid:18) n

ℓn(i)(cid:19) xℓn(i),

and for all y ∈ CLn ,

(P ∗n y)ℓn(i) = 1,s(cid:18) n

ℓn(i)(cid:19) yi,

i = 1, . . . , Ln,

i = 1, . . . , Ln.

In particular,

P ∗n Pn x = x, whenever x ∈ Xn.

Proof. The two properties Pn P ∗n = IdLn×Ln and range(P ∗n ) = Xn equivalently
say, that the row vectors of Pn build an orthonormal basis of Xn.

For any y ∈ CLn, the vector P ∗n y is a linear combination of the vectors p1, . . . , pLn

and therefore in Xn. Labelling its components by ℓn(1), . . . , ℓn(Ln), we obtain

(P ∗n y)ℓn(i) =

4. Symmetric Kronecker products

4.1. Iterated Kronecker products. We next investigate the action of an n-fold
Kronecker product on the symmetric subspace Xn, n ∈ N.
Proposition 2. Let M ∈ Cd×d, and denote by m1, . . . , md ∈ Cd the row vectors
of the matrix M . Then,

M n⊗x ∈ Xn,

The components of these vectors can be labelled by k ∈ Nd with |k| = n, and we

4.2. Symmetric Kronecker products. Having proven that n-fold Kronecker
products leave the nth symmetric subspace invariant, we deﬁne the n-fold sym-
metric Kronecker product as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. For M ∈ Cd×d and n ∈ N, we deﬁne the Ln × Ln matrix

Sn(M ) = Pn M n⊗ P ∗n

and call it the n-fold symmetric Kronecker product of the matrix M .

The n-fold symmetric Kronecker product has useful structural properties.

satisﬁes Sn(M )∗ = Sn(M∗). If M ∈ GL(d, C), then

Sn(M ) ∈ GL(Ln, C) with Sn(M )−1 = Sn(M−1).

In particular, if M ∈ U (d), then Sn(M ) ∈ U (Ld).
Proof. Since (M ⊗ M )∗ = M∗ ⊗ M∗ and (M n⊗)∗ = (M∗)n⊗, we have

Sn(M∗) = Pn(M n⊗)∗P ∗n = Sn(M∗).

If M is invertible, then M ⊗ M is invertible with (M ⊗ M )−1 = M−1 ⊗ M−1. By
Proposition 2,

Proposition 1 yields P ∗n Pn x = x for all x ∈ Xn and

(M n⊗)−1pj ∈ Xn,

j = 1, . . . , Ln.

Pn pj = ej,

j = 1, . . . , Ln,

where e1, . . . , eLn ∈ CLn are the standard basis vectors. Therefore,

Sn(M ) Sn(M−1) ej = Pn M n⊗ P ∗n Pn (M n⊗)−1pj = Pn pj = ej,

that is,

Sn(M ) Sn(M−1) = IdLn×Ln .

4.3. The main result. The explicit formula of Proposition 2 for the n-fold Kro-
necker product also allows a detailed description of the n-fold symmetric Kronecker
product.
Theorem 1. Let M ∈ Cd×d, and denote by m1, . . . , md ∈ Cd the row vectors of
the matrix M . Then, the n-fold symmetric Kronecker product satisﬁes

Proof. By Proposition 1, we have P ∗n y ∈ Xn and
ℓn(i)(cid:19) yi,

(P ∗n y)ℓn(i) = 1,s(cid:18) n

for i = 1, . . . , Ln.

By Proposition 2, the n-fold Kronecker product leaves Xn invariant, and we have

5. Application to semiclassical wavepackets

5.1. Parametrizing Gaussians. We consider two complex invertible matrices
A, B ∈ GL(d, C) that satisfy the conditions
(1)

(2)

AtB − BtA = 0,
A∗B + B∗A = 2 Idd×d.

These two conditions imply that B A−1 is a complex symmetric matrix such that
its real part satisﬁes

Re(B A−1) = (A A∗)−1

is a Hermitian and positive deﬁnite matrix, see [Hag80]. Let  > 0 and deﬁne the
multivariate complex-valued Gaussian function

ϕ0[A, B] : Rd → C,
ϕ0[A, B](x) = (π )−d/4 det(A)−1/2 exp(cid:18)− hx, B A−1 xi

2 

(cid:19) .

Then, ϕ0[A, B] is a square-integrable function, and the constant factor det(A)−1/2
ensures normalization according to

ZRd |ϕ0[A, B](x)|2 dx = 1.

Changing the parametrization by a unitary matrix changes the Gaussian function
only by constant multiplicative factor of modulus one:
Lemma 5. Let A, B ∈ GL(d, C) satisfy the conditions (1–2). Then, for all unitary
matrices U ∈ U (d), the matrices A′ = A U and B′ = B U also satisfy the conditions
(1–2). Moreover,

ϕ0[A′, B′] = det(U )−1/2 ϕ0[A, B].

Proof. We observe that

and B′ (A′)−1 = B U U∗A−1 = BA−1. Therefore,

(A′)tB′ − (B′)tA′ = U t(AtB − BA)U = 0
(A′)∗B′ + (B′)∗A′ = U∗(A∗B + BA)U = 2 Idd×d.
ϕ0[A′, B′] = (π )−d/4 det(A U )−1/2 exp(cid:18)− hx, B A−1 xi

2 

= det(U )−1/2 ϕ0[A, B].

(cid:19)

(cid:3)

5.2. Semiclassical wave packets. Following the construction of [Hag98], we con-
sider A, B ∈ GL(d, C) satisfying the conditions (1–2) and introduce the vector of
raising operators

R[A, B] =

(B∗ x − iA∗(−i∇x))

that consists of d components,

1
√2
R[A, B] = 


R1[A, B]

...

Rd[A, B]

.




The raising operator acts on Schwartz functions ψ : Rd → C as
(B∗ x ψ(x) − iA∗(−i∇xψ)(x)) ,

(R[A, B]ψ) (x) =

1
√2

x ∈ Rd.

Powers of the raising operator generate the semiclassical wave packets according to

ϕk[A, B] =

1

√k!R[A, B]kϕ0[A, B],

k ∈ Nd,

where the kth power of the raising operator

R[A, B]k = R1[A, B]k1 ··· Rd[A, B]kd

does not depend on the ordering, since the components commute with one another
due to the compatibility conditions (1–2). The set

forms an orthonormal basis of the space of square-integrable functions L2(Rd, C).

(cid:8)ϕk[A, B] : k ∈ Nd(cid:9)

5.3. Hermite polynomials. By its construction, the kth semiclassical wave packet
is a multivariate polynomial of degree |k| times the Gaussian function, that is,

ϕk[A, B] =

pk[A] ϕ0[A, B].

1

√2|k| k!

The polynomials pk[A] are determined by the matrix A ∈ GL(d, C) and satisfy the
three-term recurrence relation

(cid:0)pk+ej [A](cid:1)d

j=1 =

2
√

A−1x pk[A] − 2A−1A(cid:0)kj pk−ej [A](cid:1)d

.

j=1

Whenever the parameter matrix A has all entries real, A ∈ GL(d, R), then the
polynomials factorize according to

pk[A](x) =

d

Yj=1

Hkj(cid:16) 1√ (A−1x)j(cid:17) ,

x ∈ Rd,

where Hn is the nth Hermite polynomial, n ∈ N, deﬁned by the univariate three-
term recurrence relation

Hn+1(y) = 2 y Hn(y) − 2 n Hn−1(y),

y ∈ R.

The real parameter case, however, is rather expectional when using semiclassical
wave packets for their key application in molecular quantum dynamics. There,
the parameter matrices A(t) and B(t), t ∈ R, are time-dependent and determined
by a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. For the particularly simple, but
instructive example of harmonic oscillator motion, one can even write the solution
explicitly as

A(t) = cos(t) A(0) + i sin(t) B(0),

B(t) = i sin(t) A(0) + cos(t) B(0).

Hence, the matrix A(t) cannot be expected to have only real entries, and the crucial
matrix factor A(t)−1A(t) in the three term recurrence relation generates multivari-
ate polynomials beyond a tensor product representation.

5.4. Changing the parametrization. If A, B ∈ GL(d, C) satisfy the compat-
ibility conditions (1–2), then |A| = √AA∗ is a real symmetric, positive deﬁnite
matrix, and the singular value decomposition of A,

A = V ΣW ∗ with Σ = diag(σ1, . . . , σd) positive deﬁnite,

is given by an orthogonal matrix V ∈ O(d) and a unitary matrix W ∈ U (d). This
provides two natural ways for transforming A′ = A U with A′ ∈ GL(d, R) and
U ∈ U (d). One may work with the polar decomposition of A,
and U = W V ∗,

A′ = |A| = V Σ V ∗

or alternatively with

A′ = V Σ and U = W.

Both choices provide a unitary transformation to the real case, and we ask
how to relate diﬀerent families of wave packets that correspond to unitarily linked
parametrizations. For an explicit description, we collect the semiclassical wave
packets of order n in one formal vector

~ϕn[A, B] = 


ϕℓn(1)[A, B]

...

ϕℓn(Ln)[A, B]


 ,

whose components are labelled by the multi-indices ℓn(1), . . . , ℓn(Ln). Then, we
use the n-fold symmetric Kronecker product in the following way:

Corollary 1. Let A, B ∈ GL(d, C) satisfy the conditions (1–2), and consider the
matrices A′ = A U , B′ = B U with U ∈ U (d). Then,

~ϕn[A′, B′] = det(U )−1/2 Sn(U ) ~ϕn[A, B],

n ∈ N.
Proof. We observe that the raising operators transform according to

R[A′, B′] = R[A U, B U ] = U∗ R[A, B],

which means for the components that

Rj[A′, B′] =

d

Xm=1

umj Rm[A, B],

j = 1, . . . , d.

Since all components of the raising operators commute which each other, we can
use the multinomial theorem and obtain for all n ∈ N that

Rj[A′, B′]n = X|α|=n(cid:18)n

α(cid:19) uα

j R[A, B]α,

where u1, . . . , ud ∈ Cd denote the column vectors of the matrix U . This implies
for any k ∈ Nd with |k| = n,
R[A′, B′]k = X|α1|=k1

··· X|α|=kd (cid:18)k1

d R[A, B]α1+···+αd ,

where the d summations run over α1, . . . , αd ∈ Nd. Together with Lemma 5, we
therefore obtain
