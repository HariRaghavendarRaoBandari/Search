1. INTRODUCTION

It is an important question to study whether there exist K¨ahler metrics of constant
scalar curvatures, or more general, the extremal metrics, in given K¨ahler classes. The
underlying equation is a fourth-order or sixth-order nonlinear complex elliptic equation
for potential functions. The general form of such an equation seems out of reach at the
present time.

In a series of papers [11], [12], [13], and [15], Donaldson studied this problem on
toric manifolds and proved the existence of metrics of constant scaler curvatures on
toric surfaces under an appropriate stability condition. Later on in [7] and [8], Chen,
Li and Sheng proved the existence of metrics of prescribed scaler curvatures on toric
surfaces under the uniform stability condition.

Toric manifolds are a class of K¨ahler manifolds which admit a (C∗)n-action with
a dense, ﬁxed-point free orbit and hence admit moment maps with images given by
convex polytopes in Rn. On toric manifolds, invariant K¨ahler metrics can be character-
ized by their symplectic potentials, which are smooth strictly convex functions on the
polytopes. As a result, the fourth-order nonlinear complex elliptic equation mentioned
above is reduced to a fourth-order nonlinear real elliptic equation, referred to as the
Abreu equation.

In [14], Donaldson suggested to study the existence K¨ahler metrics of constant scalar
curvatures on toric ﬁbrations. He presented the underlying equation, which we call the
generalized Abreu equation. In this paper we show that the method developed by Chen,
Li and Sheng can be used to study constant scalar curvatures on homogeneous toric
bundles.

The main result in this paper is following theorem, concerning the existence of metrics

of prescribed scalar curvatures on homogeneous toric bundles.

Theorem 1.1. Let (M, ω) be a compact toric surface and ∆ be its Delzant polytope.
Let G/K be a generalized ﬂag manifold with dim(Z(K)) = 2 and G ×K M be the
homogeneous toric bundle. Let D > 0 be the Duistermaat-Heckman polynomial, and
A ∈ C∞( ¯∆) be a given smooth function. Suppose that D is an edge-nonconstant func-
tion on ¯∆ and (∆, D, A) is uniformly stable. Then, there is a smooth (G, T 2)-invariant
metric G on G ×K M such that the scalar curvature of G is S = A + hG.

Theorem 1.1 provides an afﬁrmative answer to the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture

for the homogeneous toric bundle in the case S = constant and n = 2.

Refer to Section 2 for various notations and terminology, in particular, the expressions
of D and hG in (2.10) and the notions of the uniform stability in Deﬁnition 2.1 and the
edge-nonconstant functions in Deﬁnition 2.4.

The underlying equation is the following fourth-order PDE:

(1.1)

where S is the scalar curvature function on ∆ and D and hG are two known functions
which are determined by the underling geometry, with D strictly positive in ¯∆. On toric
varieties, we have D ≡ 1 and hG ≡ 0, and the equation (1.1) reduces to the Abreu
equation. In consistence with toric varieties, we write A = S − hG.
The equation (1.1) was introduced by Donaldson [14] in the study of scalar curvatures
of toric ﬁbrations. See also [27] and [25]. We call (1.1) the generalized Abreu equation.
Our aim in this paper is to solve (1.1) in Delzant polytopes for solutions satisfying the
Guillemin boundary condition.

We ﬁrst note a simple fact. Even if the scalar curvature S is constant, the right-
hand side of the equation (1.1) is a function in general, due to the presence of hG.
The difference between the Abreu equation and the generalized Abreu equation seems
minor, with two functions D and hG inserted in the Abreu equation. However, the
difference in the underlying geometry is signiﬁcant and, as a consequence, the study of
the generalized Abreu equation has become more complicated.

We ﬁrst review studies of the Abreu equation for dimension 2, with functions in the
right-hand side. Donaldson derived an L∞-estimate as well as the interior regularity.
Chen, Li and Sheng derived regularity near boundary by a series of techniques such as
afﬁne blowup, differential inequalities on afﬁne invariant quantities and the Bernstein
theorem. They derived regularity near edges and near vertices by different methods.
The proof of the regularity near edges consists of three steps. First, they derived an
estimate of Ricci curvatures near edges in geodesic balls in terms of the determinants

PRESCRIBED SCALER CURVATURES FOR HOMOGENEOUS TORIC BUNDLES

3

of the Hessian of solutions. Second, they derived a lower bound of geodesic distances.
Third, they derived estimates of a ratio of two determinants related to the Hessian of
solutions. By combining these three steps, they obtain regularity near edges. To obtain
regularity near vertices, it is crucial to construct subharmonic functions in the preimages
of neighborhoods of vertices by moment maps.

Now we turn our attention to the generalized Abreu equation (1.1) in ∆. For ∆ ⊂ R2,
Nyberg [25] derived an L∞-estimate as well as the interior regularity for toric ﬁbrations.
For general dimension, Li, Lian, and Sheng [21] proved that the uniform stability is the
necessary condition for the solvability of the generalized Abreu equation and implies
the interior regularity. Some estimates and differential inequalities were established in
[22] and [24].

Our main concern in this paper is the boundary regularity for the generalized Abreu
equation (1.1). We will use methods from [7] and [8] to the present setting. Some
generalizations from the Abreu equation to the generalized Abreu equation are straight-
forward, while others are technical and involve more complicated calculations, mostly
due to the presence of the function D in (1.1).

The form of (1.1) is hard to analyze. We need to write it in its equivalent forms. The
Abreu equation is given by (1.1) with D = 1 and hG = 0. In this case, we can discuss
u = u(ξ) or its Legendre transform f = f (x). The Hessian of u or f plays an important
role. In fact, [det(uij)]−1 satisﬁes a linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation in coordinates
(ξ1,· · · , ξn) and log det(fij) also satisﬁes a similar linearized Monge-Amp`ere equation
in coordinates (x1,· · · , xn). We can consider any one of these equations depending on
our purposes. However, we do not have such options for the generalized Abreu equation
(1.1). For (1.1), the Hessian is replaced by D det(fij), which satisﬁes nice equations in
(ξ1,· · · , ξn). The function log[D det(fij)] satisﬁes a linear equation with lower order
term in coordinates (x1,· · · , xn). A similar equation also holds in complex manifolds.
Based on these equations, we can discuss convergence of sequences of fk in complex
manifolds.

Estimates near vertices are different signiﬁcantly. For toric varieties, we need to esti-
mate in preimages U of vertices by moment maps. Now for homogeneous toric bundles,
similar estimates need to be established in G(U), under the group action. It is more
complicated to construct subharmonic functions there.

We will follow [7] and [8] closely in our study of homogeneous toric bundles. Some
estimates were already established in [21], [22], and [24]. In this paper, we will focus
only on the difference caused by the presence of D in (1.1).

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we brieﬂy review homogeneous
toric bundles and introduce the generalized Abreu equation. We also review some ba-
sic estimates for the generalized Abreu equation. In Section 3, we discuss estimates of
geodesic distances near the boundary of polytopes. In Section 4, we estimate Ricci cur-
vatures near divisors. In Section 5 and Section 6, we discuss an upper bound and a lower
bound of a function H, respectively. In Section 7, we prove a convergence theorem and
we only point out the difference. In Section 8, we discuss regularity near boundary and
ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.1. Sections 3, 5 and 6 are similar to the corresponding
part in [8]. We only present main estimates. For other sections, we provide a little more
detailed discussions and emphasize the difference from the corresponding part in [7]
and [8].

2. PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we brieﬂy review homogeneous toric bundles and introduce the gener-
alized Abreu equation. We also review some basic estimates for the generalized Abreu
equation.

2.1. Homogeneous Toric Bundles. We recall some facts about homogeneous toric
bundles and refer to [26], [3] and [14] for details. Let G be a compact semisimple
Lie group, K be the centralizer of a torus S in G, and T be a maximal torus in G con-
taining S. Then, T ⊂ C(S) = K and G/K is a generalized ﬂag manifold. Denote
o = eK. Let g (resp. k, h ) be the Lie algebra of G (resp. K, T ) and B denote the
Killing form of g. Recall that −B is a positive deﬁnite inner product on g. There is an
orthogonal decomposition with respect to −B given by

g = k ⊕ m,

with Ad(k)m ⊂ m for any k ∈ K. The tangent space of G/K at o is identiﬁed with m.
Let Z(K) be the center of K, which is an n-dimensional torus, denoted by T n. Let
(M, ω) be a compact toric K¨ahler manifold of complex dimension n, where T n acts
effectively on M. Let ̺ : K → T n be a surjective homomorphism. The homogeneous
toric bundle G ×K M is deﬁned to be the space G × M modulo the relation

(gh, x) = (g, ̺(h)x)

for any g ∈ G, h ∈ K, x ∈ M.

Later on, we will omit ̺ to simplify notations. The space G×K M is a ﬁber bundle with
ﬁber M and base space G/K, a generalized ﬂag manifold. There is a natural G-action
on G ×K M given by

g · [h, x] = [gh, x]

for any g ∈ G, x ∈ M,

and a natural T n-action on G ×K M given by
k · [h, x] = [g, k−1x]

for any k ∈ T n.

Denote by gC, kC, hC the complexiﬁcation of g, k, h, respectively. Let R be the root

and set Hϕ = √−1hϕ. Deﬁne t = hT z(kC). Consider the restriction map κ : h∗ → t∗

κ(α) = α|t.

Set RT = κ(R) = κ(RM ). The elements of RT are called T -roots.

Since the moment map is equivariant, we can also regard τ as a map from G ×K M to

by τ ([g, x]) = τ (x).
Suppose that ∆ is deﬁned by linear inequalities hk(ξ) − ck > 0, for k = 1,· · · , d,
where ck are constants and hk are afﬁne functions in Rn, k = 1,· · · , d, and each hk(ξ)−

duced by Donaldson [14] in the study of scalar curvatures of toric ﬁbrations. See also
[27] and [25]. We call (2.11) the generalized Abreu Equation.

2.3. Uniform Stability. We introduce several classes of functions. Set

C = {u ∈ C( ¯∆) : u is convex on ¯∆ and smooth on ∆},
S = {u ∈ C( ¯∆) : u is convex on ¯∆ and u − v is smooth on ¯∆},

where v is given in (2.5). For a ﬁxed point po ∈ ∆, we consider

Cpo = {u ∈ C : u ≥ u(po) = 0},
Spo = {u ∈ S : u ≥ u(po) = 0}.

We say functions in Cpo and Spo are normalized at po.

Following [25], we consider

where D > 0 and A are given smooth functions deﬁned on ¯∆. FA is called the Mabuchi
functional and LA is closely related to the Futaki invariants. The Euler-Lagrangian
equation for FA is (2.11). It is known that, if u ∈ S satisﬁes the equation (2.11), then u
is an absolute minimizer for FA on S.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let D > 0 and A be two smooth functions on ¯∆. Then, (∆, D, A) is
called uniformly K-stable if the functional LA vanishes on afﬁne-linear functions and
there exists a constant λ > 0 such that, for any u ∈ Cpo,
(2.14)
uDdσ.

LA(u) ≥ λZ∂∆

We also say that ∆ is (D, A, λ)-stable.

Li, Lian and Sheng [21] proved that
(1) if the equation (2.11) has a solution in S, then (∆, D, A) is uniform K-stable,
(2) the uniform K-stability implies the interior regularity for any dimension n.

Remark 2.2. Nyberg [25] proved (2) for toric ﬁbration and n = 2.

Donaldson [15] derived an L∞-estimate for the Abreu equation in ∆ ⊂ R2. His

method can be applied directly to the generalized Abreu Equation ∆ ⊂ R2. See [25].
Theorem 2.3. Let ∆ ⊂ R2 be a Delzant polytope and D > 0 and A be two smooth
functions deﬁned on ¯∆. Let u ∈ C∞(∆) satisfy (2.11). Suppose that ∆ is (D, A, λ)-
stable. Then,

where Co is a positive constant depending on λ, ∆, D and kAkC0.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let K be a smooth function on ¯∆. It is called edge-nonconstant if it is
not constant on any edge of ∆. It is called edge-nonvanishing if it does not vanish on
any edge of ∆.

2.4. Some Estimates for the Generalized Abreu Equation. We adopt notations in
[7], [8]. Let (M, ωo) be a compact toric K¨ahler manifold of complex dimension n and
denote by τ : M → ¯∆ ⊂ t the moment map of M, where ∆ is a Delzant polytope.
Suppose that ωo is the Guillemin metric with the local potential function g. For any
T n-invariant metric ω ∈ [ωo] with the local potential function f, there is a function φ
globally deﬁned on M such that

f = g + φ.

Set

C∞(M, ωo) = {f|f = g + φ, φ ∈ C∞T2(M) and ωf > 0}.

Fix a large constant Ko > 0. We set

C∞(M, ωo; Ko) = {f ∈ C∞(M, ωo)||S(f )| ≤ Ko}.

Take a point po ∈ ¯∆. We choose coordinates ξ1, ..., ξn such that ξ(po) = 0. Let u =
u(ξ1, ..., ξn) ∈ S be a solution of (2.11). Set

topes. We proceed similarly as in Section 5 [8] and we only state results.

Let ∆ ⊂ R2 be a Delzant polytope, ℓ be an edge of ∆ and ℓ◦ be the interior of ℓ. Let
h∗ ⊂ t∗ be the half plane given by ξ1 ≥ 0. Take a point ξ(ℓ) ∈ ℓ◦. For simplicity, we ﬁx
a coordinate system on t∗ such that (i) ℓ is on the ξ2-axis; (ii) ξ(ℓ) = 0; (iii) ∆ ⊂ h∗.

Suppose that ∆ is uniformly (D, Ak, λ)-stable and that Ak C 3-converges to A on ¯∆.

Denote by hk the restriction of uk to ℓ. Then, hk locally uniformly converges to a convex
function h on ℓ. Obviously, u∞|ℓ◦ ≤ h. By the estimates of determinantes provided by
Lemma 2.5 and Lemma 2.6 and the same argument as in Subsections §5.1-§5.2[8], we
get the C 0-convergence and the strict convexity of h as follows.

By Theorem 2.7, Theorem 2.8 and by using the same method as in Subsections §5.3-

§5.4[8] (see [22] for more explanation), we can prove the following result.
Theorem 3.3. Let p ∈ ℓc,d. Suppose that Da(p)∩ ∂∆ ⊂ ℓc−ǫo,d+ǫo for some 0 < a < ǫo.
Then, there exists a small constant ǫ, independent of k, such that the intersection of the
geodesic ball B(k)
ǫ (p) and ∆ is contained in a Euclidean half-disk Da(p) ∩ ∆. Here
Da(p) and B(k)
a (p) denote the balls of radius a that are centered at p with respect to the
Euclidean metric and Calabi metric Guk respectively.

4.1. Uniform Control of Sections. In order to use afﬁne blow-up technique we need to
control sections (see Subsection §7.2[7]). For the generalized Abreu equation we need
more arguments due to the presence of the function D.
2 + ψ is strictly

We consider functions u ∈ C∞(h∗, vh∗); namely u = ξ1 log ξ1 + ξ2

convex for some ψ ∈ C∞(h∗). We assume, in addition,
(4.6)
u(p, ∂h∗) ≤ C2,
where du(p, ∂h∗) is the distance from p to ∂h∗ with respect to the Calabi metric Gu.

Θu(p)d2

Let z◦ ∈ Uh∗ be any point such that d(z◦, Z) = 1 and z∗ ∈ B1(z◦)∩ Z, where d(z◦, Z)
is the distance from z◦ to Z with respect to the metric Gf . Without loss of generality, we
assume that z◦ is a representative point of its orbit and assume that it is on t. Let p◦ and
p∗ be their images of moment map τf , respectively.

By adding a linear function we normalize u such that p◦ is the minimal point of u,

i.e.,

(4.7)
Let ˇp be the minimal point of u on ∂h∗ which is the boundary of h∗. By adding some
constant to u, we may require that
(4.8)

u(p◦) = inf u.

u(ˇp) = 0,

and, by a coordinate translation, we may assume that

we can normalize u such that

and d(p◦, ∂h∗) = 1.

|S0| = 10.

We say (u, p◦, ˇp) is a minimal-normalized triple if u satisﬁes (4.7), (4.8), (4.9), (4.11),

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let (u, p◦, ˇp) be a minimal-normalized triple. Let N be a constant sufﬁ-
ciently large. We say that (u, p◦, ˇp) is a bounded-normalized triple if

result. In fact, only Lemma 7.6 in [7] needs more explanation, which we gave in [22].

Theorem 4.3. Let (uk, p◦k, ˇpk) be a sequence of bounded-normalized triples. Suppose
that limk→0 |S(uk)| → 0. Then,

By afﬁne transformations as in (4.16) with λ = 1, we can minimal-normalize (ˇu, ˇp◦, ˇˇp).
To simply notations we still denote them by ˇu, ˇd and etc, after this transformation. Since
ˇR, ˇK, ˇK, ˜Ψ and ˇW (z)/ ˇW (z′) for any z, z′ ∈ BN (˜zo) are invariant under these transfor-
mations, then (ˇu, ˇp◦, ˇˇp) satisﬁes the assumption of Theorem 4.3.

We assume that ∆ ⊂ Rn is a Delzant polytope and that M is the corresponding toric

variety. Set

In this section, we present a lower bound of the function H deﬁned in the previous

section. We ﬁrst introduce a subharmonic function.

Let ϑ be a vertex and C2

ϑ be a coordinate chart associated to the vertex ϑ. Now
consider an element f ∈ C∞(M, ω). Let fϑ be its restriction to Uϑ. We introduce a
function

Fϑ = log Fϑ + Nfϑ.

20

CHEN, HAN, LI, LIAN, AND SHENG

We now prove that Fϑ is a subharmonic function, with respect to (cid:3), the Laplacian

operator of the metric Gf . In [24] we proved the following result.
Lemma 6.1. Choose {o, νi, i = 1, ..., n} as a base of Rn, let ¯∆ ⊂ {(ξ1, ..., ξn)|ξ1 >

that Zℓ = {z1 = 0}. As in [7], we can prove

for any q ∈ Ba/2(p0),

and

(7.1)
where λ1, λ2 are eigenvalues of the matrix (fi¯j) and C1 is a positive constant depending
on n, a and N4. Note that Fℓ = W D, where W = det(fi¯j). In coordinates Uℓ we can
rewrite (4.3) as

We point out that ﬁrst-order terms appear in (7.2) due to the presence of D for homoge-
neous toric bundles. By applying Krylov-Safonov’s estimate to the equation (7.2), we
have log(W D) ∈ C α(U), for some α ∈ (0, 1). By

8. THE PROOF OF MAIN THEOREM

In this section, we prove the existence of the solution to (2.11) by the standard conti-
nuity method. The closedness is provided by Theorem 8.3 below. For technical reasons,
we are only able to prove this under the condition that Aℓ is an edge-nonvanishing. Due
to this, we need to require that the Duistermaat-Heckman polynomial D is an edge-
nonconstant function.

8.1. The Method of Continuity. In this subsection, we construct a 1-parameter family
of equations to solve (2.11) by the method of continuity. We ﬁrst demonstrate that edge-
nonconstant D implies edge-nonvanishing Aℓ.
Remark 8.1. Let ℓ ⊂ ∂∆ be an edge and (ξℓ

Let I = [0, 1] be the unit interval. At t = 0 we start with a known metric Gv. Let K0
be its scalar curvature on ∆ and A0 = K0 − hG. Then, ∆ is (D, A0, λ0) stable for some
constant λ0 > 0 (cf. [21]). At t = 1, set (A1, λ1) = (A, λ). On ∆, set
At = tA1 + (1 − t)A0, λt = tλ1 + (1 − t)λ0.

Obviously, At = tA1 + (1 − t)A0. It is easy to verify that ∆ is (D, At, λt) stable.
Remark 8.2. For any t ∈ [0, 1], ∆ is (D, At, λ′)-stable, where λ′ = min{λ0, λ1}.

We will prove that Λ is open and closed. The openness is standard by following an
argument by Lebrun and Simanca [20]. The closedness is provided by Theorem 8.3
below. This then implies Theorem 1.1.

8.2. Regularity near ∂∆. In this subsection, we discuss the regularity near ∂∆. The
following result can be regarded as the main result in this paper.
Theorem 8.3. Let ∆ ⊂ R2 be a Delzant polytope and (M, ωo) be the associated
compact toric surface. Suppose that D is an edge-nonconstant function on ¯∆. Let
uk = v + ψk ∈ C∞(∆, v) be a sequence of functions satisfying (3.1). Suppose that

(1) Ak C 3-converges to A on ¯∆;
(2) max ¯∆ |uk| ≤ Co,

where Co > 0 is a constant independent of k. Then, there is a subsequence of ψk which
C 6,α-converges to a function ψ ∈ C 6,α( ¯∆) with S(v + ψ) = K where K = A + hG.
Proof. We estimate ψk in two steps, near edges in the ﬁrst step and near vertices in the
second.

Step 1: Estimates on edges. We will prove the regularity near each edge ℓ where Aℓ

does not vanish. Let ℓ be any edge and (ξℓ

1, ξℓ

2) be the coordinates such that

ξℓ
1(ℓ) = 0, ∆ ⊂ {ξℓ|ξℓ

1 ≥ 0}.

By Remark 8.1, we can assume that qℓ ∈ ℓ such that |Aℓ(qℓ)| > 0. Recall that fk =
g + φk, where fk, g are Legendre transform of uk, v respectively and φk ∈ C∞T2(M). Set

Ω = {(z1, z2)| log |z1|2 ≤

k ∈ Zℓ whose image of the

k )| = 0,

that there is a constant ǫ > 0 that is independent of k such that

Bǫ(ξ(ℓ)) ∩ ∆ ⊂ Da(ξ(ℓ)) ∩ ∆.

Then Bǫ(z(ℓ)) is uniformly bounded. Hence, on this domain, we assume that all data of
gℓ are bounded.

Note that Fgℓ, Wgℓ, Dg and Df are bounded on Bǫ(z(ℓ)). By Theorem 6.2, we have

(8.6)

C−1
1 ≤ Wf ≤ C1, C−1

1 ≤ Ff ≤ C1

in Bǫ(z(ℓ)).

It follows from Lemma 3.2 that

Then by Theorem 4.1 and (8.6), we conclude that there is a constant C2 > 0 independent
of k such that

(8.7)
By the convexity of u and ku − vkL∞(∆) ≤ C1, we have

K + K ≤ C2

|∂2u| ≤ Coa−1,

∂1u ≤ Coa−1.

That is maxBǫ(z(ℓ)) |z| ≤ C3. Hence, by Lemma 7.1, we have the regularity of f on
Bǫ(z(ℓ)).
Step 2: Estimates on vertices. We will prove the regularity in neighborhoods of each

vertex with the help of subharmonic functions in Lemma 8.4 below.

∂tA∂¯tB and f A ¯B denotes the inverse of the matrix fA ¯B. Set

Let φ = f − g ∈ C∞(G ×K M), where f(resp. g) are potential function of the metric
Gu(resp. Gv). Let (t1,· · · , tn+l) be the local holomorphic coordinates of G ×K M. Let
fA ¯B = ∂2f
T =X f A ¯BgA ¯B = n − (cid:3)φ, P = exp(κFα)√FΨ, Q = e−N1(φ−inf φ+1)√FT.

where {ωA} are dual (1, 0) form of {Sj}, and f is the function deﬁned in §2.2. Then, f
is potential function of G ×K M. Hence,

Note that fϑ and fℓ are not a potential function. A direct calculation gives us

for some positive constants C9 and C10 depending only on N2, the structure constants of
g, D, ∆ and the position of ∆ in R2.

By Step 1, there is a bounded open set Ωϑ ⊂ Uϑ, independent of k, such that ϑ ∈
τ (Ωϑ) and the regularity of fϑ holds in a neighborhood of ∂Ωϑ. By the G-action, we
get a G-invariant neighborhood in G ×K M, denotes by G(Ωϑ). By (8.9) we have T is
uniform bounded in a neighborhood of G(∂Ωϑ), the boundary of G(Ωϑ). It follows from
Lemma 8.4 that T is uniform bounded in G(Ωϑ). We omit the index k if no confusion
occurs.

CHEN, HAN, LI, LIAN, AND SHENG

By Lemma 8.4, P and Q are bounded above. Since Fgϑ, Dg
Df

are uniformly bounded,
by Theorem 6.2, we conclude that Ffϑ and W is bounded below and above in G(Ωϑ).
Then, T is bounded above. Since T is G-invariant, by (8.8) we have a constant C1 > 0
such that

C−1
1 ≤ χ1 ≤ χ2 ≤ C1,

k∇ log FfϑkGf ≤ C1

where χ1, χ2 be the eigenvalues of the matrix (P gi¯jfk¯j). Let λ1, λ2 (resp. µ1, µ2) be
2 ≤ µ1, µ2 ≤ C2 for

the eigenvalue of the matrix (fi¯j) (resp. the matrix (gi¯j)). Since C−1
some constant C2 > 0, we can conclude

C−1
3 ≤ λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ C3,
By the bound of k∇ log Dfk, we have

k∇FfϑkC1(Ωϑ) ≤ C3

in Ωϑ.

k log WfkC1 ≤ C4.
By Theorem 6.7 in [7], we have, for any U ⊂⊂ Ωϑ,
kfϑkC6,α(U ) ≤ C5.

where C5 is a constant depends on kAkC3(∆), dE(U, Ωϑ) and the bound of Ωϑ.
Since fϑ is G-invariant, we get the interior regularity fϑ in G(Ωϑ); namely, φk uni-
formly C 6,α-converges to a function φ ∈ C 6,α(G ×K M) with S(φ + g) = K ◦ ∇f .
Then, ψ ∈ C 6,α( ¯∆) satisﬁes (3.1).
