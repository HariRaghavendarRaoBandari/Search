The present note summarizes the discourse on power counting issues of chiral nuclear
forces, with an emphasis on renormalization-group invariance. Given its introductory
nature, I will lean toward narrating a coherent point of view on the concepts, rather
than covering comprehensively the development of chiral nuclear forces in diﬀerent ap-
proaches.

Keywords: Nuclear forces; chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory; power counting; renormalization.

1. Introduction

It has become a widespread trend to build nuclear theories upon the underlying
theory of strong-interaction physics— quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unfortu-
nately, it is a daunting task to solve QCD directly at low energies where nuclear
physics resides. There nevertheless seems to be a working strategy agreed upon by
many nuclear physicists. The ﬁrst step is to have lattice QCD calculate observables
of few-nucleon systems, to which one ﬁts the low-energy constants (LECs) of ef-
fective ﬁeld theories (EFTs). EFTs will then be used to deal with larger systems
and/or few-nucleon observables that are less amenable to lattice calculations, e.g.,
scattering observables.

EFTs oﬀer model-independent, controlled approximations for QCD at low ener-
gies, and they have several advantages over more phenomenological nuclear models.
The most important feature is their ability to make a quantitative statement about
theoretical errors, a necessary ingredient to make any quantitative calculation fal-
siﬁable.1 This ability is attributed to power counting of EFT— the organization
principle that prioritizes among inﬁnitely many contributions, which are often ex-
pressed in terms of Feynman diagrams. Power counting breaks down all contribu-
tions allowed by symmetries into diﬀerent orders, typically in powers of Q/Mhi,
where Q generically denotes the external 3-momenta of a process, and Mhi the
breakdown mass scale of EFT that is usually tied to the detail of the underlying

dynamics. It is clear that EFT works best in cases where separation of scales exists:
Q ≪ Mhi.

Nuclear physics is very interesting in that its rich phenomena indicate a hier-
archy composed of multiple length (or mass) scales. Even in the simplest system
made up of two nucleons, the S-wave scattering lengths are signiﬁcantly larger than
the pion Compton wave length. The 3S1 scattering length— 5.4 fm— is the smaller
one, but is still three times larger than the pion Compton wave length— 1.4 fm.

Proliferation of scales makes it possible to develop an EFT for each layer in
the hierarchy, potentially simplifying the dynamics by compromising its scope. For
instance, the large values of scattering lengths in two-nucleon systems suggests that
a good chunk of nuclear physics may be described by the so-called pionless EFT in
which pions are integrated out and Lagrangian terms are all contact interactions
between the nucleons.2–4 In systems where a cluster of nucleons are much more
tightly bound than the rest, the cluster can be integrated in as new low-energy
degrees of freedom, resulting in halo EFT. A good example of which is N α system.5
However, I will go in another direction and will cover the development of chiral
EFT (ChEFT) for two-nucleon systems, in which the pion degrees of freedom are
explicit. In principle, pionful EFT has a larger kinematic scope, but the inclusion
of pions makes it much more challenging to grasp, even in the simplest case of two-
nucleon system. The goal is to describe the conceptual development from a maybe
slightly idiosyncratic perspective, and I apologize in advance for missing some of
the important contributions to the ﬁeld. While a small portion of the material may
be original, the major part is known to the community.

Chiral symmetry of QCD and its explicit and spontaneous breaking are the
pillar stones of ChEFT. Not only does it explain the origin of the smallness of
the pion mass mπ, it demands that in chiral Lagrangian the couplings of pions to
other particles (including pions themselves) be proportional to the pion momenta
or the pion mass.6, 7 This construction of pion couplings obviously facilitates the
EFT expansion in powers of Q/Mhi.

In the seminal work of Ref. 8, Weinberg proposed the paradigm of analyzing
low-energy QCD processes with chiral Lagrangian. At tree-levels, it necessarily
reproduces the well-known PCAC results.9–11 More importantly, it was shown that
each pion loop brings a suppression factor of (Q/4πfπ)2, where 4πfπ ≃ 1.2 GeV.
At the end of the day, every diagram contributing to a process can be counted by a
certain power of Q, Qν, and ν is always a non-negative number. With these crucial
points, it is possible to develop some sort of perturbation theory for low-energy
processes involving only Goldstone bosons.8, 12, 13 Due to its perturbative nature,
this theory is often referred to as chiral perturbation theory (ChPT).

It then took a while to bring baryons to the stage because unlike the pions,
they are not light; even the nucleon— the lightest baryon— has a mass that is
comparable to 4πfπ. First, a technique was needed to make sure that the baryons
always propagate forward so that heavy intermediate states of baryon-anti-baryon
pairs are properly integrated out. Second, this technique must in the meantime

provide relativistic corrections order-by-order in powers of Q/mN , where mN is the
nucleon mass. Throughout the manuscript I consider only the nucleon, while with
some extensions other baryons can be included too. The theoretical tool which does
exactly that was developed in Ref. 14 by Jenkins and Manohar, called heavy-baryon
theory.

Turn to our focus— nuclear forces. We know phenomenologically that it is nec-
essary to depart from the above perturbative paradigm, for shallow-bound states
manifested by a large number of nuclei indicate that nuclear forces are intrinsically
nonperturbative. As a theoretical rationale, Weinberg pointed out that the nonper-
turbative nature of few-nucleon processes stems from the purely baryonic interme-
diate states, states that are not mixed with the pions.15 With the appearance of
these intermediate states comes small denominators proportional to (Q2/mN )−1,
the so-called infrared enhancement. While this insight helped us understand a priori
why nuclear forces are strong, it makes it no longer possible to power count the am-
plitude of few-nucleon processes in exactly the same fashion as that of one-nucleon
processes, due to the presence of mN in the numerators.

A compromise was proposed by Weinberg. One ﬁrst organizes the potentials—
two-nucleon irreducible diagrams that are free of pure baryonic states— into diﬀer-
ent orders according to standard ChPT counting, and then resums the potentials
using the Schr¨odinger equation or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. It was hoped
that the resummed amplitudes somehow inherit the ordering of the potentials.
Implementation of this prescription has, however, a much longer history16–23 and
continues to be worked upon.24–27

Despite the phenomenological successes, we need to ask for more theoretical
satisfactions from any EFT for nuclear forces. After all, the phenomenological nu-
clear forces28–35 had already achieved even better accuracies in describing nucleon-
nucleon scattering data.

If not being able to estimate the overall size of two-nucleon amplitudes is merely
an academic annoyance, another concern as to the consistency of Weinberg’s pre-
scription is more grave: the renormalizability. The Q scaling of a diagram `a la
Weinberg applies under the presumption that the diagram is renormalizable: The
ultraviolet regularization scale, say, the cutoﬀ in momentum space Λ, will be re-
moved by the running of appropriate counterterms once the diagrams at a given
order are summed up. Therefore, the absence of Λ in the ﬁnal result justiﬁes the ex-
clusive consideration of Q and ignoring Λ, when counting the diagram. Conversely,
if the ﬁnal amplitude at certain order shows strong dependence on Λ, the Q scaling
becomes questionable.

The failure of a counting scheme at renormalization test usually suggests that
some operators necessary to remove the cutoﬀ dependence are missing at the or-
der under consideration. Stated diﬀerently, the proposed power counting underes-
timated these operators and so they must be promoted. This is how in practice
renormalization and power counting impact each other. And it is not terribly sur-

prising. The estimation of LECs in Weinberg’s original prescription was based on
naive dimensional analysis (NDA). If promotion of a certain LEC is needed on
renormalization ground, it simply indicates that the LEC runs with renormaliza-
tion scale µ ∼ Q so dramatically that its value cannot be reliably estimated by
NDA.

In Section 2, I introduce the general tool, referred to as Q-calculus here, by
which a Feynman diagram is counted in powers of external momenta. The interplay
between renormalization and power counting is then exempliﬁed in Section 3. Some
of developments beyond LO are covered in Section 4, ﬁnally a short discussion is
oﬀered in Section 5.

2. Q-calculus

In the paradigm proposed by Weinberg,8 any Feynman diagram generated by chiral
Lagrangian scales in certain powers of Q or mπ. I will use a few examples to show
how this conclusion is reached.

We will at least need the following few terms of chiral Lagrangian to set up the

physics regarding chiral nuclear forces:36

where fπ = 92.4 MeV is the pion decay constant, gA = 1.26 the nucleon axial
charge, and Cs,t the S-wave nucleon-nucleon contact-interaction couplings. The
heavy-baryon formalism has been applied to the nucleon. Operators with more
ﬁelds, more derivatives, or higher powers in mπ are subsumed in the ellipsis. Later in
practical calculations, the contact operators are to be given in the more convenient
partial-wave basis. The pion-nucleon couplings shown here are all derivative, thanks
to chiral symmetry of QCD and its spontaneous breaking.

The analysis proceeds with the presumption that ultraviolet cutoﬀs will even-
tually drop out of the investigated diagram. Therefore, when a loop subgraph of
the diagram is studied, the loop integration must be over loop momenta around Q,
that is, we are interested in the contribution of the diagram to long-range physics.

2.1. Single-nucleon processes

I use a one-loop diagram that contributes to pion-nucleon scattering, shown in
Fig. 1, as the ﬁrst example to illustrate the technique.14, 37 It is assumed that
the energies and 3-momenta of incoming and outgoing pions are comparable with
mπ: Q ∼ mπ. In the spirit of studying long-range physics, we need to inspect
the integration over the loop momenta around Q, l ∼ Q, where l denotes the 4-
momentum of the pion internal line. With that, we can weigh every element in the
diagram as follows.

Fig. 1. One of the one-loop diagram contributing to pion-nucleon scattering. The solid (dashed)
line represents the nucleon (pion).

Both vertexes in Fig. 1 are the famous Weinberg-Tomozawa term, the second
operator in Lagrangian (1), contributing a factor of Q/f 2
π. The pion propagator
scales as Q−2. With the nucleon mass subtracted oﬀ from the zeroth component of
4-momenta, as conventionally done in heavy-baryon formalism, the nucleon external
momentum is of (Q2/mN , Q). But the momentum following through the nucleon
internal line is of (Q, Q), because the external pion line tends to inject an energy
at least of mπ. So the nucleon internal line is of the size Q−1. The integration
volume contributes a factor of Q4/(16π2). The numerical coeﬃcient 16π2 usually
accompanies an integral in which the pion is relativistic, l0 ∼ |~l |. Its value should
be taken with a grain of salt, for it comes from observations rather than rigorous
deductions. In conclusion, the size of the diagram is estimated as

Q
f 2

π (cid:18) Q

4πfπ(cid:19)2

.

(2)

In the loop integral, there may be other momentum modes of l causing one of
the two propagators (or both) to be enhanced, compared with the factor of Q−2 for
the pion and Q−1 for the nucleon. However, these modes are so special that they
reside only in a small integration volume. For instance, when l0 is near the energy
of the incoming pion k0, the nucleon propagator is very close to its mass shell so
that it is of the size (Q2/mN )−1. But this enhancement of the nucleon propagator
only happens to a small window of the integration volume |l0 − k0| ∼ Q2/mN , so
power counting (2) is not altered.

By comparison, special kinematic regions of external momenta often call for
more cautions. For instance, power counting in Fig. 1 needs to be modiﬁed when the
incoming pion is nonrelativistic in the sense that its 3-momentum is much smaller
than the pion mass, Q ≪ mπ. For a recent interesting application of nonrelativistic
pion in pion-baryon processes, see Ref. 38.

2.2. Two-nucleon processes

Processes involving two nonrelativistic nucleons, as is the case in low-energy nuclear
physics, present more dramatic changes in Q-calculus. Figure 2 shows a generic loop
diagram with two-nucleon intermediate states. Denoting the 4-momentum of one of
the nucleon internal lines as (E/2 + l0,~l ), with E being the center-of-mass energy,
we can write schematically the loop integral as

Fig. 2. A two-nucleon-reducible diagram. The hallow blob is a subgraph free of two-nucleon inter-
mediate states, i.e., it is a nucleon-nucleon “potential”.

If Q is again used to represent the external 3-momenta, two nucleons both have
4-momenta of the size (Q2/mN , Q). In the narrow shell of phase space |l0 − E/2| ∼
Q2/mN , both nucleon propagators are enhanced, combined to give (Q2/mN )−2.
So, the loop integral overall is ∼ mN Q/(4π), where 4π is characteristic of this sort
of nonrelativistic integrals. Referred to by Weinberg as infrared enhancement, the
presence of mN in numerators goes hand in hand with purely nucleonic intermediate
states. This analysis gives insights as to why two-nucleon systems are strongly
interacting even at low energies, where pion couplings are expected to be weak.

A more mathematically-oriented rationale can be found in Ref. 15. The integra-
tion over l0 yields (assuming that the potential does not have poles in the l0-plane)

The inclusion of the recoil term ~l2/2mN is necessary, or a spurious pole at E = 0
will be present. The necessity of including recoil eﬀects in turn suggests the said
infrared enhancement.

The recognition of purely nucleonic intermeidate states was conceptually crucial.
One immediately identiﬁes two-nucleon irreducible subgraphs as nucleon-nucleon
potentials. The irreducible diagrams still follow standard ChPT counting rule, which
is often summarized as follows:15, 36, 37 A ChPT diagram is of order Qν, and ν is
given by

ν = 2 − A + 2L +Xi

Vi∆i , ∆i = di +

where A is the number of fermion external lines, L the number of loops, Vi the
number of vertexes of type i. In the deﬁnition of factor ∆i, di is the number of
derivatives acting on each vertex of type i and fi the number of fermion lines
attached to each vertex.

It is important to keep in mind that the nucleons coming in and going out of
a potential diagram have 4-momenta of the size (Q2/mN , Q). This is an element
frequently overlooked by beginners. Let us look at how the potential of one-pion ex-
change (OPE), shown in Fig 3, is obtained. The nucleon lines of OPE are not always
external, because they will be internal lines when OPE is iterated. Their momenta

are nevertheless close to shell; therefore, the 4-momentum following through the
pion propagator is too of order (Q2/mN , Q). Since the pion energy is higher-order,
the pion propagator in OPE is taken as instantaneous at leading order (LO):

Not only does this expansion reproduce the on-shell approximation conventionally
used in deriving potentials, but it shows that the approximation is under control,
i.e., it can be systematically improved in powers of Q/mN .

Figure 3 also shows the once iteration of OPE. Its size relative to OPE indicates
under what circumstance infrared enhancement will force us to iterate OPE to all
orders, i.e., to solve the Schr¨odinger or Lippmann-Schwinger equation:39

We can see that nonperturbative treatment of OPE is required when Q & MN N ≡

π dictates the ranges of pion-exchange forces, MN N charac-
terizes the strength of OPE. It is a little remarkable that low-energy scale MN N
emerges through quantum ﬂuctuations, instead of being manifested directly in the
Lagrangian.

When Q ≪ MN N , an EFT based on perturbative OPE can be developed.2, 40
Its phenomenological successes are unfortunately limited41 because when Q is so
low, an even simpler EFT— pionless EFT— also applies. It remains nevertheless a
useful tool for theoretical explorations. I will focus in the rest of the paper on the
case of nonperturbative OPE.

3. Renormalization of OPE

Eﬀective ﬁeld theories are not well-deﬁned until they are regularized by an ultra-
violet momentum cutoﬀ Λ which excludes the high-energy quantum ﬂuctuations.
The dependence of observables on Λ is not wanted, and the procedure to get rid of
it by runnings of LECs is called renormalization.

The most obvious objection for sensitivity of observables to Λ is that it implies a
biased modeling of the underlying physics. Once the form of regularization is chosen,
such as dimensional regularization, the Gaußian regulator, etc., it is indeed tempting
to ﬁt Λ to experimental data, which is equivalent to using Λ as an input parameter.
This seems reasonable. After all, Λ is often linked to the breakdown scale, Mhi,
where the details of underlying physics becomes important. While it is not wrong
to do so, the strategy behind this practice is opposite to that of EFTs. From the
perspective of EFTs, the value of Mhi is implied from the size of subleading orders,
or more speciﬁcally, the values of gν, the coeﬃcient in front of the term (Q/Mhi)ν .
Therefore, setting a value for Λ and taking that to mean Mhi will eﬀectively assign
a value for each of subleading gν, with ν > 0. As a result, gν’s will be strongly
correlated to each other through Λ. However, in reﬂecting the unbiased attitude
toward the underlying physics we would like gν’s to be independent parameters.
It is in this sense that the sensitivity to cutoﬀ jeopardizes a model-independent
description of short-range physics.

The second reason to remove Λ is that Q-calculus is based on the assumption
that when all the diagrams at a given order are summed up, they will be renormal-
ized. The Λ dependence in ﬁnal results suggests that diagrammatic elements like
propagators, vertexes, and loop-integration volumes scale not only with Q, but also
with Λ.

In the one-baryon sector, the calculation is perturbative, so at least part of it
can be done analytically. Renormalizability is therefore easy to verify. The non-
perturbative resummation for few-nucleon processes is amenable only to numerical
calculations, and hence the cutoﬀ-independence, or renormalization-group (RG) in-
variance, cannot be investigated until the calculation is actually done with various
values for Λ. But we would need the power counting, which has yet been veriﬁed,
to carry out the numerical calculation. To break away from the catch-22 mental
picture, one must realize that power counting will necessarily be self-consistent:
One proposes a reasonable power counting and then checks its renormalizability,
done with the calculations guided by the to-be-veriﬁed power counting.

In Weinberg’s power counting (WPC),15, 36 the starting point is NDA, which
states that if an operator has dν derivatives (or mπ) on it, its coeﬃcient Cν is
suppressed by factor of M −ν
. NDA is much more reliable if Mhi is the only scale
hi
of the problem, which happens more often in EFTs whose LO is a free theory.
However, the emergence of low-energy scale MN N complicates greatly the situation,
because one always faces many combinations of Mhi and MN N when dimensionally
analyzing gν.

I now turn to LO where OPE is resummed to all orders, and discuss how renor-

malization of this resummation tells us what goes wrong with NDA.

3.1. Quark-mass dependence of 1S0 counterterms

The ﬁrst evidence that NDA does not fulﬁll RG invariance comes from the quark-
mass dependence of 1S0 amplitude. After projecting onto 1S0, LO potential by
WPC has two pieces. One is the standard form of a Yuakawa potential with strength
proportional to m2

π and a chiral-invariant contact part:

where ~q is the momentum transfer.

Although the Yukawa part is a regular potential by itself, its interference with
the contact interaction C0 can produce ultraviolet divergences. Reference 42 showed
that the divergence is logarithmic

(10)

This m2
π-dependent divergence would need a quark-mass dependent contact term to
absorb it, and yet chiral-invariant C0 cannot do that. The need for m2
π-dependent
counterterms at LO means that they have to be promoted, as compared with NDA.
Therefore, D2m2
π must be included in the LO 1S0 contact potential, as proposed in
Refs 42, 43.

3.2. Singular attractions of OPE tensor force

Although conceptually important, the promotion of D2m2
π did not have much phe-
nomenological impact, because chiral extrapolation was not the most urgent ap-
plication at the time. What caught more attentions was the realization that the
tensor part of OPE has renormalization issues too, though a while later, due to the
singular attraction of the OPE tensor force.

The singular attraction is most clearly exhibited in coordinate space:

VT (~r ) =

(11)

S12 = 3(~σ1 · ˆr)(~σ2 · ˆr) − ~σ1 · ~σ2 .

(12)

When sandwiched between certain partial waves, S12 has negative matrix elements,
leading to asymptotic behavior −1/r3 near the origin.

There had been a long history studying singular potentials that are proportional
to inverse powers of r.44 It was known that the attractive singular potentials do not
have a sensible short-range part because it causes a particle to “fall” to the cen-
ter.45 The pathology of their short-range part was reinterpreted in Ref. 46 as the
strong sensitivity of observables to the arbitrarily chosen Λ. A model-independent
treatment of short-range physics was then proposed: A short-range counterterm is

added and is made to run with Λ in such a way that physical observables are inde-
pendent of Λ. The point here is that the short-range potential, initially considered
as subleading corrections, must appear at LO, together with the singular long-range
force. Such an insight concerning importance of the short-range potential is reached
a priori, rather than being based on a ﬁt to data.

Reference 47 applied the same rationale to the OPE tensor force, and concluded
that in spin-triplet channels where VT (~r ) is attractive, a counterterm is required
on renormalization ground. These channels include 3S1 −3 D1, 3P0, and 3P2 − 3F2
in S and P waves. While a constant counterterm in 3S1 −3 D1 is already expected
by NDA, the need for P -wave counterterms at LO is a surprise because they have
two powers in momenta (or two derivatives in coordinate space). For instance, 3P0
counterterms after projection are

V3P0 = C3P0 p′p + D3P0 p′p(p′2 + p2) + · · · ,

(13)

where ~p and ~p ′ are incoming and outgoing center-of-mass momenta, respectively.
So the promotion of C3P0 p′p to LO is an enhancement of C3P0 by two orders, as
compared with NDA.

The immediate criticism to this change of power counting is that inﬁnitely many
counterterms will be needed at LO, since with arbitrarily high angular momentum
the number of singularly attractive partial waves is inﬁnite. Fortunately, OPE is not
always nonperturbative as orbital angular momentum increases for a ﬁxed center-
of-mass energy. At some point, OPE becomes subject to perturbation theory and
by then renormalization will agree with NDA. A study on where OPE becomes
perturbative can be found in Ref. 48.

4. Higher orders

Even though renormalization can veto a power counting scheme, fulﬁlling RG in-
variance does not make it absolutely correct. It is not diﬃcult to imagine that there
exist many RG-invariant power counting schemes. Therefore, a strategy is needed
to ﬁnd the most eﬃcient one that describes data well with a minimum number of
LECs, while avoiding too many ﬁne-tunings.

In the series of works I was involved,49–51 the strategy is the following:

(1) Assume that the Q-calculus regarding the long-range physics, i.e., pion ex-

change diagrams does not need modiﬁcation.

(2) Start with NDA for counterterms since it has the fewest short-range parameters

at a given order, while assuming no ﬁne-tuning.

(3) Check the cutoﬀ independence, or the lack thereof.
(4) If RG invariance is violated, identify the higher-order counterterm that is

needed for renormalization. Promote it.

(5) Go back to (1) for next order.

It is a better practice to treat the higher-order interactions, either multiple-pion
exchanges or counterterms, as perturbation on top of LO, because they are not

small corrections until corresponding diagrams are successfully renormalized.52 The
carefulness here stems from the precaution that two procedures involved here may
not commute: Renormalization, in which Λ is varied, and the partial resummation
of a subset of higher-order contributions.

To go beyond the LO of N N scattering, whose power counting is controlled by
renormalization of OPE, it is expected that higher-order counterterms are those
renormalizing two-pion exchanges (TPEs).18, 19 The leading TPE is suppressed by
factor of (Q/Mhi)2, according to the counting rule for irreducible pion-exchange
diagrams (5). So it seems reasonable that subleading counterterms in each partial
wave are two orders down from LO . While this is the case for the triplet channels,
1S0 presents an interesting complication.

OPE has the form of the Yukawa potential in 1S0 and subsequently the LO
residual cutoﬀ dependence can be shown to be of order (Q/Λ)T (0), where T (0)
is the LO amplitude .51, 53 Because the cutoﬀ uncertainty is just one source of
theoretical errors, it follows that the LO theoretical error is O(Q/Mhi). The impact
of this ﬁnding on power counting is that such a large uncertainty cannot wait until
order Q2 to be addressed; a short-range interaction instead of TPEs must appear
at order Q to reduce the error. This line of thought eventually leads to a hierarchy
of 1S0 counterterms that look just like those of contact EFT:

V1S0 = Xn=0

C2nQ2n , C2n =

Without considering the impact of residual cutoﬀ dependences, Ref. 54 interestingly
reached a similar conclusion, with the only diﬀerence being that order Q is still
vanishing.

In triplet channels, the LO residual cutoﬀ errors are not large enough to give
rise to a non-vanishing order Q. One just needs to ﬁnd out the counterterms that
renormalize one insertion of TPE into the LO amplitude. References 50 summarized
the ﬁnding as modiﬁed NDA, that in attractive triplet channels the enhancement of
counterterms over NDA is uniform. For instance, C3P0 , D3P0 , and so on, in Eq. (13)
are all enhanced by factor (Mhi/Q)2. Although with the same idea, Ref. 55 proposed
in coupled channels a diﬀerent scheme with more counterterms. It has yet been
resolved why such a diﬀerence exists.

5. Discussions

In Q-calculus, the running of renormalized LECs against Q was not explicitly con-
sidered, although this is implicitly accounted for when cutoﬀ-independence is ver-
iﬁed. An ambitious approach is to ﬁgure out how renormalized counterterms scale
with Q before the full calculations are done, by solving the Wilson’s version of RG
equation.48, 56, 57

The nonperturbative nature of nuclear forces makes a ChEFT analysis less trans-
parent than in single-baryon systems, for numerical calculations are often inevitable,

one way or another. RG invariance provides us with a valuable tool to scrutinize our
understanding toward chiral nuclear forces, before we confront the power counting
with experimental data.

Are there other apparatuses than RG invariance to probe the consistency of a

power counting?
