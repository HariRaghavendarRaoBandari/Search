Abstract

H2 = 17.94 ± 0.01 and log N B

An independent analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption system at redshift zabs = 2.059 in the spectrum
of the quasar J 2123−0050 is presented. The H2 system consists of two components (A and B) with column
densities log N A
H2 = 15.16 ± 0.02. The spectrum exhibits the lines of HD molecules
(log N A
HD = 13.87 ± 0.06) and the neutral species C i and Cl i associated with the H2 absorption system. For
the molecular hydrogen lines near the quasar’s Lyβ and O vi emission lines, we detect a nonzero residual ﬂux,
∼ 3 % of the total ﬂux, caused by the eﬀect of partial coverage of the quasar’s broad-line region by an H2 cloud.
Due to the smallness of the residual ﬂux, the eﬀect does not aﬀect the H2 column density being determined
but increases the statistics of observations of the partial coverage eﬀect to four cases. The uniqueness of the
system being investigated is manifested in a high abundance of the neutral species H2 and C i at the lowest H i
column density, log NH I = 19.18 ± 0.15, among the high redshift systems. The H2 and C i column densities in the
system being investigated turn out to be higher than those in similar systems in our Galaxy and theMagellanic
Clouds by two or three orders ofmagnitude. The NHD/2NH2 ratio for component A has turned out to be also
unusually high, (4.26 ± 0.60) × 10−5, which exceeds the deuterium abundance (D/H) for high-redshift systems by
a factor of 1.5. Using the H i, H2, HD, and C i column densities and the populations of excited H2 and C i levels,
we have investigated the physical conditions in components A and B. Component A represents the optically
thick case; the gas has a low number density (n ≈ 30 cm−3) and a temperature T ∼ 140 K. In component B,
the mediumis optically thin with n < 100 cm−3 and T ≥ 100 K. The ultraviolet (UV) background intensity in
the clouds exceeds the mean intensity in our Galaxy by almost an order ofmagnitude. A high gas ionization
fraction, nH+ /nH ∼ 10−2, which can be the result of partial shielding of the systemfrom hard UV radiation,
is needed to describe the high HD and C i column densities. Using our simulations with the PDR Meudon
code, we can reconstruct the observed column densities of the species within the model with a constant density
(nH ∼ 40 cm−3). A high H2 formation rate (higher than the mean Galactic value by a factor of 10 − 40) and
high gas ionization fraction and UV background intensity are needed in this case.

1. Introduction

One way to study the physical conditions and chemical
composition of the interstellar and intergalactic media
at high redshifts is to investigate the absorption sys-
tems in the spectra of bright extragalactic sources, such
as quasars or gamma-ray bursts. Most of the absorp-
tion lines in the spectra of such objects are associated
with the Lyman alpha (Lyα) lines of neutral hydrogen
falling within the optical range due to the cosmological
redshift z. The absorption systems of the Lyα forest are
believed to relate to the clouds of almost fully ionized
hydrogen located in the intergalactic medium on the line
of sight between the quasar and the observer. Neutral
hydrogen absorption systems with a very high H i col-
umn density (log NH I > 19, here and below, the column
densities are measured in cm−2) are detected approxi-

mately in 10 % of the quasar spectra. If the column den-
sity log NH I > 20.3, then such an absorption system is
called a DLA system (Damped Lyman Alpha system);
if 19.0 < log NH I < 20.3, then the system belongs to
the class of sub-DLA systems. The DLA systems are
believed to be the main reservoirs of neutral hydrogen
in the early Universe [1, 2]. In the spectra of quasars, the
sub-DLA and DLA systems are identiﬁed owing to the
broad Lyá absorption line with characteristic Lorentz
wings. Another peculiarity of such systems is the pres-
ence of many absorption lines of heavy elements1 in the
spectrum at the same redshift. The DLA systems appear
to be the disks or halos of protogalaxies with a radius of
several 10 kpc [3]. Due to the high column density NH I,
the matter in DLA systems is shielded from ionizing ul-
traviolet (UV) radiation with an energy exceeding the

2

ionization energy of the hydrogen, E > 13.6 eV. But, at
the same time, it is believed that the medium in sub-
DLA systems can be partially shielded due to the lower
HI column density, and gas regions with diﬀerent ion-
ization fractions can simultaneously fall on the line of
sight. When the elemental abundances in sub-DLA sys-
tems are analyzed, the ionization corrections should be
applied (see, e.g., [4, 5]).

The detection of the H2, HD, and CO molecular
absorption systems (see [6, 7, 8, 9]), which are known
from observations in our Galaxy and Local Group galax-
ies (see, e.g., [10, 11, 12]) relate to dense cold clouds
(n ∼ 10 − 500 cm−3, T ∼ 40 − 200 K) in the interstellar
medium, suggests that the matter in DLA and sub-DLA
systems belongs to the interstellar medium and not to
the intergalactic one.

The H2 absorption systems are observed in less than
10 % of the spectra containing DLA and sub-DLA sys-
tems [18, 19, 20]. Spectra with a high signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N > 10) and a high spectral resolution (R ∼
20 000 − 110 000), which is a limiting problem for the
largest optical telescopes at present, are needed for their
investigation. Thirty high-redshift systems have been
detected (see, e.g., [9, 13]) since the ﬁrst identiﬁcation
of H2 molecular lines in the spectra of quasars [6], de-
spite the fact that more than 12 000 DLA systems are
already known [2]. We have developed a technique of
searching for H2 candidates in the medium-resolution
spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, [21]),
which has revealed more than 50 H2 candidates to date
[19]. Moreover, the ﬁrst observations of eight candidates
at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) led to their conﬁrma-
tion (Balashev et al., in preparation). The main objec-
tive of studying high-redshift molecular hydrogen clouds
is to determine the physical conditions in the cold phase
of the interstellar medium. This is important for under-
standing the star formation and evolution of galaxies at
high redshifts and for understanding the nature of DLA
systems and their connection with galaxies.

In this paper, we present an independent analysis
of the H2/HD absorption system at redshift zabs =
2.059 in the VLT spectrum of the quasar J 2123−0050.
Previously, this system has already been investigated
in the quasar spectrum taken at the Keck telescope.
However, the results of two papers [22, 23] disagree both
in the number of components of the investigated absorp-
tion system and in the estimated H2 column density. A
high signal-to-noise ratio in continuum in the VLT spec-
trum, S/N ∼ 20 − 120, compared to S/N ∼ 10 − 40 in
the Keck spectrum allowed one to study in more detail
the structure of this system and to obtain more accu-
rate column densities of H2 and HD molecules at various
rotational levels.

An unusual feature of the H2 system in the spectrum
of J 2123−0050 is a high H2 column density for one of
the components of the absorption system, log N A
H2 =
17.94 ± 0.01, despite the fact that the atomic hydro-
gen column density log NH I = 19.18 ± 0.15 [5] is lowest
among the DLA and sub-DLA systems in which the H2
systems were detected (see Fig. 1). The measured H2 col-
umn density in the spectrum of J 2123−0050 is almost
three orders of magnitude higher than that for the H2
clouds located in our Galaxy and having similar column
densities NH I. One would think that such a diﬀerence

can be explained by a relatively low UV background
intensity. However, it has been found that the UV back-
ground intensity in the sub-DLA system of J 2123−0050
to be considerably higher than the mean Galactic value,
[5], [24].

Apart from the H2 molecules, the lines of HD
molecules are detected in the system J 2123−0050 [23].
The NHD/2NH2 ratio in this system turned out to be
a factor of 1.5 higher than the primordial deuterium
abundance and a factor of 3 or 4 higher than the val-
ues measured in high redshift H2/HD systems (see [9]).
These and other facts are of additional interest for the
studies of physical conditions in this H2 system.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The quasar J 2123−0050 (with redshift zem = 2.261
and apparent magnitude mV = 16.6) was identiﬁed
in the SDSS. High-resolution spectra of this quasar
were taken independently at the two largest optical
telescopes, Keck (using the High Resolution Echelle
Spectrograph, HIRES) and VLT (using the Ultraviolet
and Visible Echelle Spectrograph, UVES). The quasar
was observed at the Keck telescope in the wavelength
range 3071 − 5869 Å in 2006 under the U080Hb pro-
gram (Prochaska). The data are in free access from the
Keck archive2 . The slit size was chosen to be 0.4”, the
CCD pixels were binned 2 × 1. These settings allowed a
spectrum with a resolution R ∼ 100 000 to be achieved.
We reduced and added the exposures using the MAKEE
software package3 . The total exposure time was ∼ 6.1 h.
J 2123−0050 was observed at the VLT in 2008 under
the 81.A-0242 program (Ubachs). The data are in free
access from the European Souther Observatory (ESO)
archive4 . Diﬀerent settings were used for the blue and
red arms of the UVES spectrograph. For the blue arm,
the slit size was chosen to be 0.8”, and the CCD pixels
were binned 2 × 2. For the red arm, the slit size was cho-
sen to be 0.7”, and the CCD pixels were binned 1 × 1.
These settings allows a spectrum with a resolution of
49 620 for the blue part and 56 990 for the red one to
be achieved. We reduced the individual exposures using
the UVES Common Pipeline Library (CPL) data reduc-
tion pipeline release 4.9.5 software package4. The total
exposure time was ∼ 11.3 h.

3. THE SUB-DLA ABSORPTION SYSTEM AT

z = 2.06

The sub-DLA system at redshift zabs = 2.06 in the
spectrum of the quasar J 2123−0050 was ﬁrst inves-
tigated by [5] and then by [24]. The sub-DLA sys-
tem consists of at least two components with column
densities log NH I(z = 2.05684) = 18.40 ± 0.30 and
log NH I(z = 2.05930) = 19.18 ± 0.15 [5]. The lines of
H2, HD, C i, and Cl i molecules, which are known to be
indicators of the cold phase of the interstellar medium
(see, e.g., [25, 26, 27]), are detected in the component
at z = 2.05930.

– see [1, 14, 15, 16]) as well as for the systems in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds (squares, diamonds, and
triangles – [12, 17]). The system being investigated has the lowest HI column density (log NH I = 19.18 ± 0.15)
among the high-redshift systems with log NH2 ∼ 18.

3.1. The Ionization Structure

In it well known that in contrast to DLA systems, where
the medium is thought to be predominantly neutral,
much of the hydrogen (up to 90%) in sub DLA systems
is in an ionized state, which should be taken into account
when analyzing such systems. The sub-DLA systems are
believed to have a layered (multiphase) structure. The
hydrogen ionization fractions in the neutral and ionized
phases are close to 0 and 1, respectively, i.e., the matter
is separated into predominantly fully neutral and fully
ionized phases and is not a mixture with some ionization
fraction.

The metals in sub-DLA systems occupy a spatially
larger region than does the neutral hydrogen; therefore,
the structures of sub-DLA systems (H i + H ii) mani-
fest themselves in the absorption lines of metals with
diﬀerent ionization states, such as O, S, Si, Al, Zn, etc.
In a predominantly neutral medium, the metals are in
the ground state, at the ﬁrst ionization level with an en-
ergy above 13.6 eV, because the UV photons capable of
ionizing such ions are absorbed by neutral hydrogen. In
the region of almost fully ionized hydrogen in sub-DLA
systems, the relationship between the number densities
of metals at various ionization levels is established in

accordance with the balance between the recombination
and ionization rates of the species. In the spectrum, such
an ionization structure manifests itself in the simultane-
ous presence of absorption lines of metals with various
ionization states in the same velocity components.

In the

sub-DLA system in the

spectrum of
J 2123−0050, for example, Si is represented at least in
three ionization states, Si ii, Si iii, and Si iv, whose ab-
sorption structure is shown in Fig. 2. The system has
up to 20 individual components detected simultaneously
in Si (and Al) lines in various ionization states. Given
the ionization corrections, the metallicity changes from
[Si/H] = +0.00 ± 0.025 to [Si/H] = −0.71 ± 0.15 [5].

J 2123−0050 has been investigated in several studies.

pendently by [22] in the Keck spectrum and by [28] in

the VLT spectrum to place constraints on the possible
time variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. The
HD/2H2 ratio of the molecular cloud was investigated
by [23] in the Keck spectrum (for a comparison of the
results of these analyses, see Table 1). We performed an
independent analysis of this absorption system in the
VLT spectrum. The parameters of the absorption sys-
tem were determined by comparing the observed spec-
trum with the synthetic one. To determine the best-ﬁt
parameters, we used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) technique.

H2 = 17.94 ± 0.01 and log N B

4.1. Analysis of the H2 System in the VLT Spectrum
The H2 lines of nine Lyman bands and one Werner band
fall within the wavelength range of the UVES spectro-
graph (3000 Å < λ < 11 000 Å)6. At least two compo-
nents (hereafter A and B) at redshifts zA = 2.05932(5)
and zB = 2.05955(3) are detected in the H2 lines of the
transitions from the rotational levels J = 0 to J = 5. The
relative velocity shift between components A and B is
fairly large compared to the width of the UVES point
spread function ∼ 6 km s−1 and the Doppler line broad-
ening ∼ 1 − 5 km s−1 and is ∼ 22 km s−1. Therefore, the
individual components in the transition lines proﬁles are
resolvable even for the saturated J = 0 and 1 levels.
Since no evidence for the presence of additional compo-
nents was found (see Fig. 3), we used a two-component
model. The best-ﬁt parameters and their errors are given
in Table 2. The synthetic spectrum of the H2 absorption
system is shown in Fig. 4. The total column densities
are log N A
H2 = 15.16 ± 0.02.
Note that the Doppler parameter bJ increases with in-
creasing level J. This eﬀect is well known for H2 systems
[29, 30, 31] and can be caused by a nonuniform distribu-
tion of H2 molecules at diﬀerent rotational levels J over
the molecular cloud volume (for more details, see [32]).
In Fig. 5 the relative rotational level populations
NJ/gJ are plotted against the level excitation energy EJ
(gJ is the statistical weight of level J) for the two com-
ponents of the H2 system. For the component A, the J
= 0 and 1 levels are populated through collisions. The
kinetic temperature of the gas determined from the ra-
tio of the ortho- and para-hydrogen column densities is
TA = 139 ± 6 K. The J = 3, 4, and 5 levels are populated
mainly through radiative pumping. In J 2123−0050 B,
the total H2 column density is lower than that in com-
ponent A by almost three orders of magnitude. In an
optically thin medium, the radiative pumping process
is important for all H2 levels; therefore, the tempera-
ture determined from the ratio of the ortho- and para-
hydrogen column densities, TB = 648 ± 126 K, can diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the kinetic temperature of the gas.

4.2. The Residual Flux in Molecular Hydrogen Lines

For H2 clouds at high redshifts, the partial coverage ef-
fect, when the H2 cloud partially covers the quasarŠs
emission regions, is possible (see, e.g., [33, 31, 34]). Part
of the quasarŠs emission passes by the absorption cloud
and produces a residual ﬂux (RF) in the spectrum at
the bottom of the H2 absorption lines. Disregarding this

eﬀect in the analysis of H2 lines can lead to an underes-
timation of the H2 column density (by up to two orders
of magnitude). As it was shown by [35] the eﬀect of
partial coverage of quasars by H2 absorption systems at
high redshifts should be observed at least in 10 % of the
cases.

In the spectrum of J 2123−0050, we detect a nonzero
RF for component A (in the most saturated H2 lines
of the transitions from J = 0, 1) in the region of the
Lyβ and O vi emission lines, 3.4 ± 0.5 % of the contin-
uum ﬂux. Figure 6 shows the line positions in the spec-
trum (upper left panel) and the RF at the line minimum
(lower left panel). Analysis of the dependence of the RF
on the product of the wavelength and oscillator strength
for the H2 transitions (for more details, see [34]) sug-
gests that a nonzero RF in the H2 line is most likely not
caused by the convolution of the saturated lines with the
instrumental function of the spectrograph but is prob-
ably a consequence of the partial coverage eﬀect (see
the right panel in Fig. 6). To analyze the H2 absorption
system, we used four models: (i) without any sources
of additional radiation, (ii) with a source of additional
radiation in continuum, (iii) with a source of additional
radiation in emission lines, and (iv) with two sources
of additional radiation in continuum and emission lines.
For a quantitative comparison, we used the statistical
AICC (corrected Akaike information criterion; see [36])

criterion7. The results of our analysis are presented in
Table 3. For models (iii) and (iv), the AICC values are
found to be lower (∆AICC ∼ −40) than those for mod-
els (i) and (ii). Taking into account the RF in continuum
allows the AICC values to be reduced by 10 more units.
The H2 lines are best described by model (iv). It should
be noted that in view of the low H2 column density and
the RF smallness (about 1 − 4 %), allowance for the par-
tial coverage eﬀect aﬀects weakly the H2 column densi-
ties being determined (see columns 7 and 8 in Table 3).
However, this case increases the statistics of observa-
tions of the partial coverage eﬀect for high-redshift H2
absorption systems to four cases.

5. ANALYSIS OF HD LINES

To estimate the column density of HD molecules, we
used the VLT spectrum. Because of the smallness of the
H2 column density in component B (log N B
H2 = 15.16 ±
0.02), the expected column density of HD molecules does
not exceed log N B
HD ≤ 11; therefore, it is impossible
to detect the HD lines in this component at the ex-
isting sensitivity level of modern telescopes. The lines
of HD molecules are detected only in component A
for the transitions of the Lyman and Werner bands up
to L8-0 and W0-0. To determine the HD column den-
sity (J = 0), we used the L0-0, L2-0, L3-0, L5-0, L7-
0, and L8-0 transition lines of HD molecules, which

ence of the AICC values. ∆AICC = 10 is deemed to mean
strong evidence for the model with the smaller AICC value
[37].

tory wavelengths of the HD transitions were taken from
[38]. The oscillator strengths were taken from the cal-
culations by [39]. The estimated column density of HD
molecules is log N A
HD = 13.87 ± 0.06. The HD line pro-
ﬁles and the ﬁtted synthetic spectrum are shown in
Fig. 7. The derived value is consistent with the esti-
mate log N A

the higher signal-to-noise ratio in the VLT spectrum,
our estimate of NHD is considerably more accurate.

6. NEUTRAL CARBON

∗) and 2s22p23P2 (C i

The structure of the neutral carbon line for the transi-
tions from the ground, 2s22p23P0 (C i), and two excited,
2s22p23P1 (C i
∗∗), states consists
of at least two components at redshifts coincident with
the positions of components A and B of the H2 system.
The neutral carbon lines were analyzed for four mod-

according to the estimate by [37], is strong evidence for
model (ii). Figure 8 shows the synthetic spectrum for
model (ii) ﬁtted into the quasarŠs observed spectrum.
The appearance of an additional C i subcomponent that
is not detected in the H2 lines can be explained by the
presence of neutral carbon associated with the ionized
part of the sub-DLA system.

According to the estimate by [5], up to 90 % of the
matter in the sub-DLA system being investigated is in
an ionized state. Assuming that the C+ ions are dis-
tributed uniformly over the volume, the bulk of the C+
column density belongs to the ionized gas, where the
electron number density (ne ∼ nH+) turns out to be
three orders of magnitude higher than that in the neu-
tral medium (ne < 10−3 × nH; see e.g., [40, 41]). As a
result of these two factors, the amount of C i formed in
the recombination reaction of C+ ions with electrons can
reach the observed value in component C: log NC I ∼ 13.
From the chemical equilibrium condition,

NC I = NC+

neα(C+)

β(C)

,

(1)

where α(C+) is the recombination coeﬃcient (α(C+) ∼
10−12 cm3s−1 for T ≃ 3 × 103 K, see [42]), β(C) =
χUV × 2.1 × 10−10 s−1 – is the CI photoionization rate
(see., e.g., [43]), χUV is the UV background intensity
with respect to the mean Galactic value [44]. However,
since the C ii 1334.5 Å absorption line in the spectrum
consists of several overlapping saturated components,

the total C+ column density cannot be determined. On
the other hand, the amount of C+ can be estimated by
assuming that the carbon abundance with respect to
its solar abundance is the same as that for sulfur (S).
For metallicity [S/H] = −0.2 and log N tot
H = 20.06 [5],
we obtain log N tot
C+ = 16.25. The fraction of C+ ions as-
sociated with the ionized part of the sub-DLA system
can be estimated as N tot
H = 1016.2. Then,
according to Eq. (1), we obtain

6.1. The Partial Coverage Eﬀect for the Neutral Carbon

System

The absorption lines of two transitions, C i 1328.8 Å and
1656.9 Å, , shifted by the factor (1 + zabs) are in the re-
gion of the quasar N v è C iv emission lines, respectively.
Out of these C i lines, only the C i 1656.9 Å line falls
within the wavelength range of the quasar’s VLT spec-
trum accessible to analysis. As was shown by [33], when
analyzing the quasar Q 1232+082, the residual ﬂux in
the C i lines due to the partial coverage eﬀect can reach
20 − 30 % of the total ﬂux, which can change signiﬁ-
cantly the C i column densities being determined. To

Klimenko et al.: Estimation of Physical Conditions

7

check this possibility, we varied the residual ﬂux in the
C i lines near the C iv emission line, along with other
parameters. The results of our analysis with (models
(iii) and (iv)) and without (models (i) and (ii)) taking
into account the RF are compared in Table 4. In mod-
els (ii) and (iv), the RF is detected at 1 ± 1 % of the
total ﬂux. However, since the C i lines are unsaturated,
allowance for the RF in our analysis barely changes the
χ2 and AICC values (compared to those for models (i)
and (iii), respectively). Thus, we cannot unambiguously
determine whether the partial coverage eﬀect is present
or absent in the C i lines (at a 1 ± 1 % level) for this
system.

7. COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS WITH

THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS ANALYSES

OF THIS SYSTEM

7.1. The H2 Column Density in the Component A
The results of our analysis of the H2 system in the VLT
spectrum of J 2123−0050 are compared with the results
of the analyses of the H2 system in the Keck spectrum
of J 2123−0050 [22, 23] in Table 1. The results diﬀer
mainly in H2 column density estimate for component
A at the J = 0 level. N A
H2(J = 0) obtained in this pa-
per is log N A
H2(J = 0) = 17.37 ± 0.02, which exceeds the
estimate from [23] by a factor of 3 (16.86 ± 0.24) and
the estimate from [22] by a factor of 30 (15.80 ± 0.40).
Diﬀerent quality of the spectra and diﬀerent allowance
for the Lyα-forest absorption lines overlapping with the
H2 lines can be responsible for the diﬀerence between
the results of our analysis and those of [22, 23]. Among
all the H2 lines of the transitions from the J = 0 level
accessible to analysis, only two lines, L0R0 and L3R0,
do not overlap with the Lyá-forest lines. Figure 9 shows
the proﬁles for the H2 absorption lines of the transi-
tions from the J = 0 level for the Keck (upper panel)
and VLT (lower panel) spectra. The solid curve indicates
the synthetic spectrum of the H2 system constructed us-
ing the H2 column densities determined in this paper.
The Lyá-forest lines in the proﬁles for the H2 lines of the
L2R0 and L4R0 transitions are seen to fall into the H2
line wing, while the Lyα-forest lines for the L1R0 and
L6R0 transitions are located near the H2 line center. To
determine the H2 column density at the J = 0 level by
comparing the observed spectrum with the synthetic one
using all of the accessible H2 lines, it is necessary to ar-
tiﬁcially add the Lyα-forest absorption lines to the syn-
thetic spectrum of the H2 system. The spectral param-
eters (N and b) and the number of components for the
unsaturated Lyα-forest lines cannot be unambiguously
determined in most cases, because such systems belong
to the root part of the curve of growth. Therefore, dis-
regarding or, conversely, overusing the Lyα-forest lines
in the analysis can lead to an overestimation or under-
estimation of the H2 column density being determined,
respectively.

7.2. The HD/2H2 ratio
Using the total H2 and HD column densities in compo-
nent A, log N A
HD = 13.87 ±
0.06, we determined the HD/2H2 ratio for component A,

H2 = 17.94 ± 0.01 and log N A

HD/2N A

H2 = (4.26 ± 0.60) × 10−5. This value is lower
N A
than that measured by [23], (7.9 ± 4.6) × 10−5, but it
exceeds the primordial deuterium abundance estimated
by [45], (2.62 ± 0.15) × 10−5, by almost 3 standard de-
viations. Figure 10 compares the measured NHD/2NH2
in the absorption systems in the spectra of quasars
at zabs > 2 and in the systems of our Galaxy. The
data were taken from Table 2 in [9] (quasars) as well as
[11, 46] (our Galaxy). At present, the H2/HD system be-
ing investigated is the only one in which the NHD/2NH2
ratio exceeds the primordial deuteriumabundance esti-
mate. The possible explanations of such a high value
are most likely related to the chemistry of molecular
clouds; more speciﬁcally, under certain physical condi-
tions in the cloud, the deuterium molecular fraction can
exceeds the hydrogen molecular fraction ([47] see also
Sect.9.1).

8. PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN THE

MOLECULAR CLOUDS J 2123−0050 A
AND B

8.1. The UV Background Intensity
The upper rotational levels of H2 molecules with J = 3,
4, and 5 are populatedmainly through radiative pump-
ing (see, e.g., [48]). The H2 rotational level population
diagrams for components A and B are shown in Fig. 5.
Component A with a high column density corresponds
to the optically thick case [49], while component B has
a low column density and represents the optically thin
case [50]. In the optically thin case, the shielding of UV
radiation is negligible. This allows a simple estimate of
the UV background intensity to be obtained within the
framework of a homogeneous model, where the gas num-
ber density and the UV background intensity are as-
sumed to be constant over the cloud volume. In the op-
tically thick case, as the depth of radiation penetration
into the cloud increases, the UV background intensity
can decrease by several orders of magnitude due to the
eﬀect of shielding by H2 molecules (see, e.g., [51, 52]). At
the center of an optically thick cloud, the H2 molecules
are predominantly at the lower J = 0 and 1 rotational
levels, while the H2 molecules near the cloud boundary
can strongly populate the upper J = 3, 4, and 5 ro-
tational levels (see, e.g., [51, 32]). Therefore, numerical
simulations, for example, with the Meudon PDR [52] or
CLOUDY [53] codes, should be used for detailed calcu-
lations. Our calculation within the homogeneous model
gives only an approximate estimate.

The component B represents the optically thin case
that can be described in the approximation of a homo-
geneous cloud. The ortho- (J = 1, 3, 5) and para- (J
= 2, 4, 6) hydrogen level populations are determined
by radiative pumping, H2 collisions withHatoms, and
spontaneous transitions:

H2 (nHk24 + βp4,2) =

H2 (A42 + nHk42 + β(p2,4 + p0,4))

H2 βp4,0 + N J=2

where β is the photoabsorption rate, k24 and k42 are the

the H2 levels (2 → 4) and (4 → 2), k35 and k53 are
those for the transitions between the H2 levels (3 → 5)
and (5 → 3), p4,0 = 0.26, p2,4 = 0.32, p4,2 = 0.32,
p0,4 = 0.08, p5,1 = 0.12 è p5,3 = 0.21 are the radiative
pumping rate coeﬃcients [50], and A42 = 2.79×10−9 s−1
and A53 = 9.8 × 10−9 s−1 are the spontaneous transition
probabilities [54]. For a temperature of ∼ 200 K, k24 =
8.8 × 10−16 and k42 = 1.8 × 10−13, k35 = 6 × 10−17 and
k53 = 5 × 10−14 in units of cm3 s−1 [55]; therefore, for
a gas number density nH < 100 cm−3, the contribution
to the populations of the J = 4 and 5 level through the
collisions of H and H2 is negligible. The photoabsorption
rate of UV radiation in the cloud can then be estimated
as

Using N J
(for J=4) and β = 2.1 × 10−9 s−1 (for J=5).

H2 from Table. 2, we obtain β = 1.8 × 10−9 s−1

The photoabsorption rate β is related to the
intensity of external UV radiation by the follow-
ing relation: β = 4π × 109JUVSshield(NH2), where
JUV (erg s−1 cm2 Hz−1 rad−1) is the intensity of UV ra-
diation with energy E = 12.87 eV averaged over the solid
angle [56], and Sshield(NH2) is the factor that takes into
account the self-shielding of the H2 cloud from the UV
background [57]8. The mean UV background intensity in
our Galaxy is J G
UV ≃ 3.2 × 10−20erg s−1 cm2 Hz−1 rad−1
(see, e.g., [44, 58]). Using the H2 column density at the
cloud center, log N B
H2 = 14.86, we ﬁnd that the inten-
sity of the external UV background in component B
is higher than the mean Galactic value by a factor of
χUV = JUV/J G

UV = 8.3.

8.2. The Gas Number Density for Components A and B

Using the C i ﬁne-structure level populations, we can
estimate the gas number density and temperature in
the cloud and the UV background intensity. In cal-
culating the balance of C i level populations, we took
into account the interaction of C i atoms with cos-
mic microwave background radiation (CMBR) photons
(TCMB = 2.725 × (1 + z) = 8.34 K), the radiative pump-
ing by UV radiation, and the collisions of C i atoms
with H i, H2, and He [59]. The collision rate coeﬃcients
were taken from [60] (for H), [61] (for ortho- and para-
hydrogen), and [62] (for He). The radiative pumping
rate coeﬃcients Γ01 and Γ02 [59] were multiplied by
the factor χUV. Since the C i column density is low
(log N ∼ 14), the C i self-shielding eﬀect may be ne-
glected.

For constant values of the gas molecular fraction
and the helium abundance, the relative level populations
nC I∗ /nC I and nC I∗∗/nC I depend only on the gas num-
ber density, temperature, and χUV. The upper panels in

0.035/(1 + x)0.5 × exp(−8.5 × 10−4(1 + x)0.5), where x =
N/5 × 1014 cm−2, b5 = b/105 cm s−1

Fig. 11 show the conﬁdence regions for the number den-
sity and the UV background intensity (the gas tempera-
ture was assumed to be equal to the values correspond-
ing to the orth-to-para-hydrogen ratio, T A
01 = 139 K
and T B
01 = 648 K, see Section 4.1). The lower panels in
Fig. 11 show the conﬁdence regions for the number den-
sity and temperature (the UV background was assumed
to be χ8.3, which corresponds to the background esti-
mate in component B; see the previous section). The
helium abundance for both components was assumed to
be nHe/nH = 0.083 (the primordial abundance; see, e.g.,
[63]), while the gas molecular fraction was f A
H2 = 0.1 for
component A (the mean value for the sub-DLA system)
and f B

H2 = 0.001 for component B.

As shown on the upper panel in Fig. 11, the gas
number density for component A depends weakly on
the UV background if χUV ≤ 10. The best value is
nA = 30 ± 10 cm−3. If the UV background in component
A is close to the value determined for component B (see
the lower panel in Fig. 11), then we cannot unambigu-
ously determine the physical conditions: the gas can be
hot and rareﬁed (T ∼ 500 K and n ∼ 10 cm−3) or cold
and denser (T ∼ 50 K and n ∼ 50 cm−3). The accuracy
of determining n and T corresponds to a change in the
NC I∗/NC I and NCI∗∗/NCI ratios within one standard
deviation.

For component B, if we assume T = T B

01 ∼ 650 K and
χUV ∼ 8.3, the gas number density is determined with
a high accuracy, nB ∼ 26 ± 4 cm−3 (see the upper right
panel in Fig. 11). However, the ortho-para-hydrogen ra-
tio in the optically thin case is known to be insensitive
to the kinetic temperature of the gas (see, e.g., [51]);
therefore, the gas temperature in the cloud can diﬀer
01. If the gas temperature is limited, T ≥ 100 K,
from T B
then our analysis of the C i level populations gives an
estimate of the gas number density n ≤ 100 cm−3.

8.3. The H2 Formation Rate on Dust in Component A
Under the condition of a stationary balance in the cloud,
the numbers of H2 molecules formed on dust and de-
stroyed by UV radiation are

RH2 nHn = 0.11βnH2,

(7)

where RH2 is the H2 formation rate coeﬃcient on dust,
n = nH + 2nH2 is the total hydrogen number density,
and β is the photoabsorption rate. The photoabsorp-
tion rate in the cloud β is related to the intensity of
the external UV background by the following relation:
β = 4 × 10−10 × χUV × Sshield(NH2) s−1. Usually, the
hydrogen molecular fraction in interstellar clouds in-
creases toward the center; therefore, the column density
ratio N A
H2/NH I = 0.05 can be used as a lower limit on
nH2 /nH at the cloud center. For the central part of the
cloud (log NH2 = 17.6, Sshield = 1.2 × 10−3), we then
obtain

RH2 n
χUV

= 2.6 × 10−15 ×

nH2 /n
(0.05)

s−1

(8)

It follows from our analysis of the C i level popula-
tions that if the UV background in component A does
not exceed χUV ≈ 10, then the gas number density is
nA = 30 ± 10 cm−3. We then obtain an estimate of

Klimenko et al.: Estimation of Physical Conditions

9

UV = 8.8 × 10−17 cm3 s−1. For comparison, the
RH2 × χ−1
mean H2 formation rate measured in molecular clouds
in our Galaxy is RG
H2 = (3 − 4) × 10−17 cm3 s−1 [50, 64].
Thus, for the observed amount of H2 to be formed in
the sub-DLA system being investigated at the mean
Galactic value of RH2, the UV background intensity
must be a factor of 2.3 lower than the mean Galactic
one. However, it follows from our simulations of compo-
nent A with the Meudon PDR code (see below) that the
UV background intensity must be a factor of ∼ 12 higher
than the mean Galactic value. Using this value, we ob-
tained an estimate of the H2 formation rate coeﬃcient
on dust in component A, RA
H2 = 1.1 × 10−15 cm3 s−1,
which is a factor of ∼ 35 higher than the mean Galactic
value.

8.4. The Gas Ionization Fraction
For low H2 column densities (log NH2 ≤ 20), absorption
in the H2 lines of the Lyman and Werner bands changes
insigniﬁcantly the number of UV photons capable of de-
stroying HD and ionizing C i (see, e.g., [65]). Therefore,
the HD and C i abundances in the medium correspond
to their equilibrium values, which depend on the e. and
H+ number densities, i.e., the gas ionization fraction.

HD molecules are formed in the reaction of colli-
sions between H2 and D+, while the abundance of D+
ions in a gas with a low molecular fraction is estab-
lished according to the chemical equilibrium of the di-
rect and reverse reactions H+ + D ⇋ H + D+ (see, e.g.,
[43]). Assuming that the cloud is homogeneous and that
the HD and H2 molecules belong to the same spatial
region, i.e., NHD/NH2 ≈ nHD/nH2, we can calculate the
number density of H+ ions from the following formula
(see, e.g., [43]):

nH+ =

β(HD)NHD

kH2+D+ NH2(D/H) k1
k2

,

(9)

where β(HD) = χUV×1.5×10−11 s−1 is the HD photode-
struction rate (χUV is measured with respect to the in-
tensity of the mean Galactic UV background from [44]),
kH2+D+ = 2 × 10−9 cm3s−1 is the HD formation rate,
D/H = 3 × 10−5 is the atomic deuterium abundance for
systems at high z, and k1/k2 = exp(−41/T ) is the ratio
of the direct and inverse H+ and D collision reaction
rates. Using the gas temperature estimated from the
ortho-to-para hydrogen ratio, T01 = 140 K, and the UV
background intensity estimated from our simulations of
component A with the Meudon PDR code, χUV = 12
(see Sect. 9.1), we obtain nH+ ≃ 0.3 cm−3.

Neutral carbon is formed in the recombination reac-
tion of C+ ions with electrons and/or polyaromatic hy-
drocarbons (PAHs) (see, e.g., [66]). However, the con-
tribution from the recombination reaction of C+ with
PAHs has not been completely established to date (for a
discussion and references, see [67]). If this reaction chan-
nel is disregarded, then the electron number density in
the gas is expressed in terms of the C i photodestruction
rate β(C) = χUV × 2.1 × 10−10 s−1, the C+ recombina-
tion coeﬃcient α(C+) = 1.8×10−11(T /100)−0.83 cm3s−1
(for 20K < T < 140K; see [66]), and the ratio of the C i
and C+ number densities:

ne− =

β(C)NC I
α(C+)NC+

,

(10)

For χUV = 12 and T = 140 K, log NC I = 14.06, and
log NC+ = 16.25, we obtain ne ≃ 1.2 cm−3. Assuming
that the gas molecular fraction for component A is
H2 = 0.1 and the number density is nA = 30 cm−3,
f A
we obtain ne/nH ∼ 4 × 10−2. Thus, in comparison with
the values measured in diﬀuse clouds in our Galaxy with
a similar gas number density (ne/nH ≤ 6.6 × 10−3, see
[41] and ne/nH ≤ 10−6), the gas ionization fraction in
component A turns out to be higher by almost an order
of magnitude.

9. SIMULATIONS OF THE MOLECULAR

CLOUD STRUCTURE

The estimates of the physical conditions obtained within
the homogeneous model (Section 8) are often approxi-
mate. Fore more proper estimates, we performed simula-
tions of the molecular cloud structure with the Meudon
PDR and CLOUDY codes.

9.1. Simulations of the Molecular Clouds with the

Meudon PDR Code

By comparing the observed H i, H2, HD, and C i col-
umn densities and the H2 and C i level population di-
agrams with the results of our Meudon PDR simu-
lations, we determined the physical conditions in the
components of the H2 absorption system. In compar-
ison with the homogeneous model, where the physi-
cal conditions and the concentrations of species are as-
sumed to be constant over the cloud volume, the code
takes into account the shielding of UV radiation in ab-
sorption lines and the shielding on dust and consis-
tently solves the thermal, ionization, and chemical bal-
ance equations in the medium (by an iterative method).
The cloud is represented as planeparallel layers of gas
and dust with a constant proton density in each layer
(np = nH + 2nH2 + nH+).

For the spectrum of the background UV radiation,
we used the model proposed by [68]. The radiation spec-
trum spans the wavelength range 912 − 8000 Å . The
radiation with a wavelength below 912 Å in the pho-
todissociation region is believed to be shielded by a
layer of atomic hydrogen and, therefore, is disregarded.
The UV background intensity with respect to the mean
Galactic value J G
UV ≃ 3.2 × 10−20erg s−1cm2Hz−1rad−1
taken from [44] was speciﬁed by the parameter χUV.
In addition to the UV radiation, the cloud is irradi-
ated by the CMBR and the cosmic-ray (CR) back-
ground. The CMBR temperature was assumed to be
2.725×(1+zabs) = 8.34 K. The CR background intensity
with respect to the mean Galactic value 2 × 10−16 s−1
(see, e.g., [69]) was speciﬁed by the parameter ěæCR. It
is important to note that in the Meudon PDR code the
gas is ionized by CRs. Therefore, CR is the key param-
eter deﬁning the ionization fraction and, consequently,
the number of HD molecules and C i atoms in the cloud
being investigated (see Section 8.4).

In our simulations, we used the abundances of ele-
ments in the cloud (He, C, N, S, Si, Fe, etc.) correspond-
ing to the mean gas metallicity in the sub-DLA system
([X/H] = −0.2; see [5]). Among these elements, carbon
plays a special role in calculating the thermal balance,
because the emission from C+ ions in the λ = 158 µm

10

line is a major gas cooling process in the interstellar
medium [70]. However, since the C ii absorption line is
strongly saturated, we cannot determine what part of
the total C+ column density belongs to the molecular
clouds being investigated. Therefore, we varied the car-
bon abundance in the cloud in a range of values cor-
responding a total carbon column density in the cloud
C = 14.5 (10−2 of the solar abundance) to
from log N tot
C in the
log N tot
sub-DLA system). At the same time, the abundances of
other elements were not varied. The carbon abundance
with respect to the solar one, (C/H)⊙ = 2.7 × 10−4 [71],
was speciﬁed by the parameter XC. The deuterium
abundance was assumed to be (D/H) = 3 × 10−5, which
corresponds to the typical D abundance at high redshifts
in molecular clouds (see, e.g., [9]).

C = 16.25 (the upper limit for log N tot

Dust is one of the most important components in
the interstellar medium; its properties aﬀect the heat-
ing rate of the medium (through the photo-electric re-
action on dust), the gas shielding from UV radiation,
and the H2 formation rate. The model from [72] was
used for the grain size distribution. The absorption of
UV radiation on dust was described using an extinc-
tion model for the SMC, RV = 2.87 (this model is be-
lieved to describe well the reddening of quasar spec-
tra; see, e.g., [73]). The amount of dust on the line of
sight was determined via the interstellar extinction pa-
rameter AV = RVE(B − V), which was set equal to
0.115 mag, corresponding to a certain upper limit on
the spectrum reddening (color excess), E(B − V) = 0.04
[65]. The dust number density in the cloud governing the
gas heating and the H2 formation rate is determined
using the dust-to-gas ratio G. We used three values:
G = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.1, corresponding to 1, 2, and
10 mean Galactic values [74]. The H2 formation in the
Meudon PDR code is computed using two mechanisms:
LangmuirŰHinshelwood and EleyŰRideal (see [75]).
However, as is pointed out in [75], the detailed descrip-
tion of H2 formation is still missing. Therefore, we used
two approaches: (i) a “numerical calculation” according
to the LangmuirŰHinshelwood and EleyŰRideal models
and (ii) an “approximate calculation” where the H2 for-
mation rate was speciﬁed by some value constant over
the cloud volume: RH2 = R0 × 3 × 10−17 cm3s−1 (with
respect to the mean Galactic value; see [50]). The latter
approach allows the possibility of a diﬀerence between
the properties of dust in a high-redshift cloud and in
our Galaxy to be taken into account qualitatively with-
out going into the speciﬁc properties of dust grains (the
size distribution, the reﬂection coeﬃcient, the sticking
coeﬃcient, the density, etc.).’

9.1.1. Simulations of the cloud J 2123−0050 A

The DLA systems have much larger sizes than the
molecular clouds: the sizes of the DLA systems are esti-
mated to be several 10 kpc [3], while the sizes of the H2
clouds are ∼ 1 pc (see, e.g., [26]). Therefore, the DLA
system occupies a larger region than does the H2 system
on the line of sight (with the H2 cloud being located in-
side the DLA system). Consequently, we cannot reliably
determine what fraction of the entire HI column density
belongs to the H2 cloud by measuring the total HI and
H2 column densities. Since the sub-DLA system being

investigated has the lowest H i column density (almost
two orders of magnitude lower than the mean NH I; see
Fig. 1) among the sub-DLA and DLA systems contain-
ing H2 and, at the same time, the H2 column density
in component A is fairly high (close to the mean NH2),
in our simulations we assume that the entire observed
H i in the sub-DLA system belongs to the H2 cloud.
Therefore, the total hydrogen column density (NH I +
2NH2) was taken to be log N = 19.22.

We used two thermodynamic cloud models: (I) with
a constant pressure and (II) with a constant hydro-
gen density. The pressure was assumed to be (8.4 ×
103) cm−3 K, which corresponds to the upper limit de-
termined by analyzing the C i level populations. The
hydrogen number density was assumed to be 40 cm−3,
which roughly corresponds to the conditions in the
cloud. The second model describes the situation where
H2 is formed in the compression region, which was
formed, for example, through the gas interaction with
the shock front.

For each model, we performed our calculations for a
grid of parameters χUV, ζCR, R0, XC and G. The model
with a constant density gives the best description for the
following set of parameters: χUV = 12, ζCR = 5 × 102,
R0 = 38, XC = 2.8 and G = 0.01 (model (f) in Table 5).
The model simultaneously reproduces the observed col-
umn densities of the species and the H2 and C i level
populations. Table 5 and Fig. 12 compare the results of
our simulations for the six most characteristic cases: (a–
e) correspond to the isobaric models, (f) corresponds to
the model with a constant density.

Main inconsistencies of the isobaric models.
Using an isobaric model, we can obtain H2, HD, and
C i column densities close to the observed ones (models
(ñ) and (e)), but we fail to satisfactorily describe the H2
and C i level population diagrams.

Models (a) and (b) correspond to the case where the
medium is irradiated by an UV background with a low
intensity, χUV = 0.4 and 1.2. In these models, the popu-
lations of H2 levels with J≥3 are more than an order of
magnitude lower than the observed values, despite the
fact that the total H2 column density is close to or even
higher than the measured value. An additional level pop-
ulation can be provided through radiative pumping with
a higher UV background intensity9 . Note that the col-
umn density of HD molecules can be described in these
models, but the C i column density turns out to be lower
by more than two orders of magnitude.

Model (ñ) describes a cloud irradiated by an UV
background with an intensity higher than the mean
Galactic one by a factor of 5. A high UV background
increases the gas heating, which in this model is compen-
sated for by an enhanced carbon abundance (XC = 1.9),
because carbon is the main coolant of the medium. The
model yields H2 and C i column densities close to the
observed ones. However, the derived HD column den-
sity and the H2 and C i level populations are inconsis-

9 Apart from the population mechanism for high H2 lev-
els through radiative pumping, other mechanisms that are
disregarded in the Meudon PDR code are considered in the
literature. For example, the excitation of H2 molecules when
the gas is compressed and heated due to the interaction of
the molecular cloud with turbulence and/or a C–shock (see
[76, 77, 78]).

tent with the measured values. The populations of the J
= 4 and 5 levels turn out to be a factor of 3 higher than
those in models (a) and (b), but still a factor of 2 − 3
lower than the observed values.

In model (d), the radiation intensity is even higher:
χUV ≃ 12. To compensate for the cloud heating, the
carbon abundance was taken to be maximally high,
XC = 3.7 (which corresponds to the case where the en-
tire C+ column density in the sub-DLA system belongs
to the molecular cloud). The gas number density and
temperature be found the same as those in model (c).
However, the obtained column density of H2 in model
(d) is log NH2 ∼ 15, that is less than the measured value
by two orders of magnitude. First, the H2 column den-
sity is too low to shield the molecules from UV radiation;
second, at the same H2 formation rate as that in model
(c), the photodestruction rate turns out to be higher
(see Eq. (7)).

In models (a)–(d), we used the “numerical calcula-
tion” according to the model from [75], with the dust-to-
gas ratio in the medium G = 0.01, for the H2 formation.
As G increases, the H2 formation rate coeﬃcient and the
eﬃciency of gas heating by UV radiation increase pro-
portionally. Despite the fact that the H2 formation rate
becomes higher, the gas number density decreases (due
to the pressure constancy condition). Therefore, accord-
ing to Eq. (7), increasing the dust content does not allow
the problem of the formation of a large amount of molec-

ular hydrogen in a medium with a high UV background
to be solved. In our calculations using an isobaric model
with a high UV background, a high carbon abundance
(as in model (d)), and G = 0.02 and 0.1, the gas turns
out to be hot, T > 1000 K, and rareﬁed, n ≤ 1 cm−3.
Virtually no H2 molecules are formed in such a medium.
The “approximate calculation”, where the H2 forma-
tion rate coeﬃcient is speciﬁed by a value constant over
the cloud volume and does not depend on the physical
conditions, can be used for the H2 formation. Model
(e) corresponds to this case. At R0 ≃ 10, χUV = 12
and XC = 3 we can simultaneously reproduce the to-
tal H2 column density and the upper level populations
(see Table 5). However, in this model we fail to repro-
duce the physical conditions in the cloud: the gas turns
out to be denser (n ≥ 100 cm−3) and colder (T ≤ 60 K).
As a consequence, the ratio of the populations of the
ﬁrst two H2 and C i levels is consistent with the mea-
sured H2 number densities, while the ratio of the C i
and C i level populations is twice that measured in the
component A.

∗

The abundance of HD molecules and the gas

ionization fraction

For models (a)–(d), the HD/2H2 ratio does not ex-
ceed 10−5, which is less than the observed value by al-
most an order of magnitude. Since HD is formed through
the ion–molecular reaction (H2 + D+), the HD forma-
tion rate increases with H+ number density, which in

12

Klimenko et al.: Estimation of Physical Conditions

the PDR models is determined mainly by the CR back-
ground intensity. The HD/2H2 ratio is consistent with
the measured value at a relative H+ number density
nH+ /nH ≈ 10−2, which corresponds to ζCR = 5 × 102,
i.e., a factor of 500 more intense CR ﬂux is needed. For
ζCR = 1, the gas ionization fraction in the Meudon PDR
models is low, nH+/nH ≈ 10−4, which is not enough for
the HD formation in a medium with a high UV back-
ground intensity. A high ζCR is probably not an estimate
of the CR background intensity in the cloud, but only
points to a high gas ionization fraction. Possible causes
are discussed below in Section 9.2.

The model with a constant density
In the model with a constant density (model (f)), we
can simultaneously describe the H2, HD, and C i column
densities and the H2 and C i level populations. In this
case, just as for the isobaric model, high UV and CR
background intensities and a high carbon abundance are
needed.

A detailed analysis of model (f) is presented in
Fig. 13. The left panel shows the number densities of
the species as a function of the distance from the cloud
boundary. The H, H+, C+, and C i number densities
barely change along the line of sight (due to the den-
sity constancy and the low gas molecular fraction). The
right panels show the D and H molecular fractions (the
upper panel: the local values are indicated by the solid
lines, while the values averaged along the line of sight
are indicated by the dashed lines) and the HD/2H2 and
D/H ratios (the lower panel). The HD formation rate in
the cloud is higher than the H2 formation rate due to
the relatively high gas ionization fraction, ∼ 10−2. As
a result, the local D and H molecular fractions at the
cloud center turn out to be twice their mean values, and,
consequently, the HD/2H2 ratio is higher than the D/H
ratio. This leads to the D/H abundance determined from
the ratio of the atomic D i and H i column densities being
lower than the isotropic D/H ratio (2.75 × 10−5 versus
3.0 × 10−5). The sign and magnitude of the eﬀect de-
pend on the mean gas molecular fraction along the line
of sight and the H+ number density. For fP H2 = 0.1,
the ND I/NH I ratio can change within 10 % of the iso-
topic ratio. The eﬀect should be taken into account if a
molecular cloud with the same redshift falls on the line
of sight passing through the H i/D i absorption system.
Obviously, in this case, the (ND I + NHD)/(NH I + 2NH2)
ratio is a proper estimate of (D/H).

9.1.2. Simulations of the cloud J 2123−0050 B

For component B (just as for component A), we can-
not determine what part of the measure H i column
density associated with the molecular cloud. Therefore,
H I was an additional free parameter and was deter-
N B
mined from the simulation results. The H i column den-
sity in the sub-DLA system, log NH I = 19.18 ± 0.15,
H I. The results of
was chosen as an upper limit for N B
our simulations are presented in Table 6. Model (g) cor-
responds to the calculations with a constant gas pres-
sure (8.4 × 103 cm−3 K); models (h) and (i) correspond
to those with a constant number density (40 cm−3).
Figure 14 shows the H2 level population diagrams for
these models. Just as in the case of simulating compo-
nent A, a high UV background intensity (χUV ∼ 12) is

needed to describe the populations of upper rotational
H2 levels. In model (g), the UV background is low and
the H2 levels are populated mainly through the colli-
sional mechanism. The populations of the lower H2 lev-
els turn out to be a factor of 3 − 5 higher than the
observed ones, while the populations of the upper J =
4 and 5 levels are an order of magnitude lower. If the
UV background is high (models (h) and (i)), then the
H2 level population diagram describes the diagram mea-
sured for component B.

At a high UV background and a low gas number
density, a high H2 formation rate coeﬃcient on dust
is needed for the H2 formation. In model (g), the H2
formation was calculated according to [75]; in models
(h) and (i), the formation rate coeﬃcient was equal
to R0. For R0 = 43, the H2 column density in models
(h) and (i) turns out to be close to the observed one.
The gas ionization fraction in component B can be es-
timated from the C i abundance (see, e.g., Section 8.4).
The observed C i column density in model (i) is recon-
structed at ne/nH = (0.9 − 1) × 10−2, which corresponds
to ζCR = 1.5 × 102.

9.2. The Ionization Structure of the sub-DLA System.

The CLOUDY Code

The high value of ζCR (5 × 102 for component A and
1.5 × 102 for component B) obtained in our simulations
with the Meudon PDR code seems unlikely and proba-
bly points only to a high gas ionization that can actually
be caused by other sources, for example, hard UV or X-
ray radiation, which cannot be taken into account in the
simulations with the Meudon PDR code. However, this
can be done with the CLOUDY code, which can com-
pute the ionization of the system by taking into account
the hard UV radiation. We simulated the structure of
the sub-DLA system and checked whether the external
UV radiation (which is shielded incompletely in the sys-
tem due to the low H i column density) could cause a
high gas ionization fraction (∼ 10−2) at the system’s
center, where the molecular cloud could be located.

The computation was performed within the frame-
work of an isobaric model with a plane–parallel geome-
try. The gas is irradiated only on one side of the system.
The radiation spectrum consists of several components:
(i) the extragalactic background (the HM96 model; see
[79]), (ii) the average Galactic background (the “ISM”
model) with an intensity that is a factor of 12 higher
than J G
UV ≃ 3.2 × 10−20erg s−1cm2Hz−1rad−1 [44], and
(iii) the CMBR at z = 2. The CR background inten-
sity was equal to the mean Galactic value 2 × 10−16 ñ−1
(see, e.g., [69, 80]). The abundances of heavy elements
corresponded to themetallicity for the sub-DLA system,
[S/H] = −0.2. Our simulations with the CLOUDY code
also show the necessity of a high H2 formation rate,
which was assumed to be 2.3 × 10−15 cm3 s−1. Since the
total hydrogen column density NH+ +NH I +2NH2 in the
sub-DLA system cannot be determined (because H+,
which accounts for as much as 90 %, is undetectable),
the computation was performed until the total neutral
hydrogen column density NH I + 2NH2 reached 1018.9
(half of N tot
H I for the sub-DLA being investigated). The
result of our simulations is shown in Fig. 15. The H+,

Klimenko et al.: Estimation of Physical Conditions

13

H,i, and H2 number density proﬁles are shown as a func-
tion of the distance from the systemŠs center.

The total H+ column density is log NH+ = 19.9,
which is a factor of 10 higher than the H i column den-
sity, i.e., the neutral gas is formed only in a narrow re-
gion near the systemŠs center, while the bulk of the
system (∼ 90 %) is ionized. The number density of H+
ions decreases rapidly with distance from the boundary
between the cold neutral and hot ionized phases (see
Fig. 15) and changes from 2.0 cm−2 at the boundary to
2 × 10−2 cm−2 at the systemŠs center. The medium is
ionized through its irradiation by the UV background;
the CR contribution is negligible (the H+, H i and H2
proﬁles barely change if the CR background is disre-
garded). Thus, despite the fact that the ion number
density decreases rapidly with neutral cloud depth, the
ionization fraction of the medium remains fairly high be-
cause of the small cloud size. The mean nH+ /nH ∼ 10−2,
in agreement with the value derived in our Meudon
PDR simulations for components A and B. Thus, partial
shielding of the hard UV radiation by neutral hydrogen
in the sub-DLA system can be responsible for the high
gas ionization fraction found in our Meudon PDR sim-
ulations.

10. CONCLUSION

We performed an independent analysis of the H2 ab-
sorption system at zabs = 2.059 in the VLT spectrum
of the quasar J 2123−0050. The H2 system consists of
two components (zA = 2.05932(5) and zB = 2.05955(2))
with total column densities log N A
H2 = 17.94 ± 0.01 è
H2 = 15.16 ± 0.01. The lines of HD molecules are
log N B
detected only in component A with a column density
HD = 13.87 ± 0.06. Our estimate of the H2 col-
log N A
umn density in component A is twice the value, ob-
tained by [23], log N A
H2 = 17.64 ± 0.15. The results dif-
fer mainly by the estimate of the H2 column density in
component A at the J = 0 level. Using our estimate of
H2, we calculated the abundance of HD molecules:
log N A
H2 = (4.26 ± 0.60) × 10−5. This value is consis-
N A
tent, within the statistical error limits, with that mea-
sured by [23], but it exceeds the primordial deuterium
abundance (D/H)Pr = (2.62 ± 0.15) × 10−5 estimated
by [45] by almost three standard deviations, which may
be due to the complex chemistry of the H2 and HD
molecules.

HD/2N A

For component A, we detected the partial coverage
eﬀect for the H2 lines located near the Lyβ and O vi
emission lines. The residual ﬂux is ∼ 3 % of the total
ﬂux. Due to the low H2 column density and low oscil-
lator strength for transitions of L1-0 and L0-0 Layman
bands, allowance for the partial coverage eﬀect aﬀects
weakly the H2 column density being determined.

The C i lines associated with the H2 system for the
transitions from the ground and two excited states are
detected in the VLT spectrum. Our analysis showed that
the C i line structure consists of three components, each
of which is associated with components A and B. The
third additional component (with log N C
C I = 12.78±0.03
and a large Doppler parameter b ∼ 7 km/s) probably
associated with the ionized part of the sub-DLA system
and not with the H2 system.

Using the observed H i, H2, HD, and C i column den-
sities as well as the H2 and C i level population diagrams
for components A and B, we investigated the physical
conditions in this system. The medium in component A
is optically thick in H2 lines and has a low number den-
sity (30 ± 10 cm−3) and temperature (T01 = 139 ± 6 K).
In such a medium, molecular hydrogen shields the UV
radiation in lines in the cloud (the H2 photodestruc-
tion rate inside and at the edge of the cloud can dif-
fer by several orders of magnitude); therefore, we used
our simulations with the Meudon PDR code to properly
determine the physical conditions with allowance made
for the UV background transfer inside the cloud. Using
the model with a constant gas density n = 40 cm−3,
a high UV background (χUV ∼ 12 in units of the
mean Galactic value), a high gas ionization fraction
(nH+ /nH ∼ 10−2), and a high H2 formation rate co-
eﬃcient on dust (RH2 = 1.2 × 10−15 cm3s−1), we can
describe the observed parameters.

The high value of NHD/2NH2 in component A is due
to the high gas ionization fraction (∼ 10−2), which is
probably a unique feature of this sub-DLA system. Our
simulations with the CLOUDY code show that such an
ionization fraction can be a consequence of incomplete
shielding of the UV radiation (with E > 13.6 eV) by neu-
tral hydrogen in the sub-DLA system. A high gas ioniza-
tion fraction leads to a signiﬁcant increase in the HD for-
mation rate. Therefore, even at a low gas molecular frac-
tion, fH2 ∼ 0.1 − 0.2, the deuterium molecular fraction
turns out to be higher than the hydrogen molecular frac-
tion, which leads to the relation NHD/2NH2 > (D/H).
The medium in component B is optically thin in H2
lines. In this case, the H2 photodestruction rate barely
changes with the depth of radiation penetration into
the cloud. Using the homogeneous model, we estimated
the UV background intensity in the cloud to be χUV =
8.3. Our simulations with the Meudon PDR code for
this component showed that the same high H2 formation
rate coeﬃcient on dust as that in component A (RH2 =
1.3 × 10−15 cm3s−1) and a high gas ionization fraction
(∼ 10−2) are needed to produce the observed amount of
H2 and C i at a high UV background (χUV = 12).

Figure 6. The left panels show the region of the VLT/EVES spectrum for the quasar J 2123.0050 containing
the H2 absorption lines. On the upper left panel, the observed ﬂux from the quasar in arbitrary units is shown
along the vertical axis; the normalized ﬂux in % of the total ﬂux is shown on the lower left panel. The gray color
highlights the region of the spectrum containing the quasarŠs Lyâ and OVI emission lines. The open and black
ﬁlled squares indicate the residual ﬂuxes at the bottom of the H2 and Lyá-forest lines, respectively. The dashed
line indicates the statistical error of the ﬂux in the spectrum. The right panel shows the residual ﬂuxes in the
H2 lines of the transitions from the J = 1 level as a function of fë, the product of the oscillator strength by the
transition wavelength. The solid and dashed lines indicate the calculations performed for the models with and
without allowance for the partial coverage eﬀect, models (iv) and (i), respectively (see Table 3).

Figure 9. Synthetic spectrum of the H2 lines of the transitions from the J = 0 level ﬁtted into the Keck/HIRES (up-
per panel) and VLT/UVES (lower panel) spectra of the quasar J 2123−0050. The H2 column density in component
A was assumed to be log N A
H2(J = 0) = 17.37. Since the widths of the HIRES/Keck (∼ 3 km/s) and UVES/VLT
(∼ 6 km/s) point spread functions diﬀer, the proﬁles of the corresponding H2 lines on the upper and lower panels
diﬀer.

Figure 11. The 1, 2, and 3σ conﬁdence regions for determining the physical conditions by analyzing the C i ﬁne-
structure level populations for components A and B (the left and right panels, respectively). The upper panels
show the conﬁdence regions for the UV background intensity (χUV, in units of the mean Galactic value) and
the number density. The temperature was assumed to be equal to the value determined from the ortho-to-para-
hydrogen ratio, 139 and 648 K for components A and B, respectively. The lower panels show the conﬁdence regions
for the temperature and the number density. The UV background intensity was assumed to be higher than the
mean Galactic value by a factor of 8.3.
