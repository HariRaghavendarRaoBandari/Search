MULTIPLICATIVE FUNCTION MEAN VALUES:

P. D. T. A. ELLIOTT

1. Statement of results

For many studies in analytic number theory a natural object against which to measure
the mean-value of a complex-valued multiplicative arithmetic function n → g(n) is the
mean-value of its attendant function n → |g(n)|.

This reﬂects the decomposition n → |g(n)| exp(i arg g(n)) of a non-vanishing completely
multiplicative function into essentially a unitary character on the multiplicative group of
the positive rationals, and a homomorphism n → log |g(n)| of the positive rationals into the
additive reals.

Some ﬁfty years ago, papers of Delange [3] 1961, Wirsing [11] 1961, [12] 1967, Hal´asz [8]
1968, catalysed the general study of multiplicative functions and moved the ﬁeld seriously
forward.

In the present paper I re-examine the theorems of Wirsing in the light of more recent

developments and apply related ideas to the consideration of two open-ended questions.

The following four cumulative theorems will be established, all new. Several auxiliary

propositions are also of independent interest.

form AL(log x), where A is a non-zero constant and L(y) a non-vanishing slowly oscillating
function of y.

Theorem 4. Let the multiplicative function g satisfy the hypotheses of Theorems 1 and 2
and let h be a complex-valued multiplicative function with |h(n)| ≤ g(n).

Then there are two possibilities.

(i) For some real t the seriesP p−1(g(p) − Re h(p)pit), taken over the primes, converges;

(ii) There is no such t, and

B(x) = o(A(x)),

x → ∞.

Of particular interest in Theorems 1 and 4 is that beyond dominance by g, there is no

non-structural constraint upon the complex values of the function h.

2. Background

Two central theorems of Wirsing’s 1967 paper run as follows.

Satz 1.1. Let λ(n) be a non-negative multiplicative function, uniformly bounded on the
primes, that for a positive τ satisﬁes

p−1 log p λ(p) ∼ τ log x,

x → ∞.

Xp≤x

Assume further that the series P q−1λ(q), taken over the prime-powers q = pk with k ≥ 2,
converges, and that if τ ≤ 1 thenPq≤x λ(q) ≪ x(log x)−1 holds for x ≥ 2.

Then

The two theorems of Wirsing may be compared to the following result of Elliott and

Kish [6], subsuming ideas from Wirsing and Hal´asz, loc, cit.

Theorem 5. Let 3/2 ≤ Y ≤ x. Let g be a complex-valued multiplicative function that for
positive constants β, c, c1 satisﬁes |g(p)| ≤ β,

p−1(|g(p)| − c) ≥ −c1,

on the primes. Suppose, further, that the series

q−1|g(q)|(log q)κ,

κ = 1 + cβ(c + β)−1,

taken over the prime-powers q = pk with k ≥ 2, converges.

Then with

uniformly for Y, x, T > 0, the implied constant depending at most upon β, c, c1 and a bound
for the sum of the series over higher prime-powers.

An extension of Theorem 5, a proof of which will be given following that for Theorem 4,

obviates the awkward condition involving the factor (log q)κ.

Theorem 6. If the estimate in Theorem 5 is weakened to

Xn≤x

g(n) ≪ x(log x)−1Yx

(|g|)(cid:0)exp(−λc(c + β)−1) + T −1/2(cid:1)c/(3c+1)

,

then the condition on the prime-power values g(pk), k ≥ 2, may be relaxed to the convergence

of the series Pp,k≥2 p−k|g(pk)| and a uniform bound for the sums y−1Ppk≤y |g(pk)| log pk,

y ≥ 2.

For the multiplicative function λ0(n) deﬁned to be α, β with 0 < α < β, on the primes
in alternate intervals (exp(2k), exp(2k+1)], k = −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . , and to be zero on all other
prime-powers,

lim
x→∞

(log x)−1Xp≤x

p−1λ0(p) log p

does not exist, eliminating direct application of S¨atze 1.1 and 1.2.

The lower bound of Theorem 2 is obtained in Elliott and Kish [6], Lemma 21, subject

to the existence of a positive constant c2 so that for all large x, Pp≤x g(p) log p ≥ c2x. By

modifying λ0 to be zero on intervals (y(log y)−2, y], y = exp(2k), we obtain a multiplicative
function λ1 that will not satisfy such a criterion for any positive c2.

Never-the-less, Theorems 1, 2 and 4 may be applied to λ0, λ1 with any dominated

complex-valued multiplicative function, h.

3. Proof of Theorem 1

It is convenient to introduce several preliminary results.

that

A proof of the following qualitative corresponding lower bound, a result ﬁrst obtained
by Barban [1] using a diﬀerent method, may be found in Lemma 20 of Elliott and Kish, [6].

Lemma 2. To each positive β there is a further positive c(β) so that a non-trivial non-
negative multiplicative function, g, that satisﬁes g(p) ≤ β on the primes, also satisﬁes

Xn≤x

g(n)n−1 ≥ c(β)Yp≤x

Lemma 3. Let g be a non-trivial non-negative multiplicative function uniformly bounded on

the primes, for which the seriesP q−1g(q), taken over the prime-powers q = pk with k ≥ 2,
converges, and for which the sums y−1Pq≤y g(q) log q, y ≥ 2, are uniformly bounded.

which Lemma 2 shows to be ≪ y(log y)−1G(x). The asserted result then follows from an
integration by parts.

For better appreciation the following theorem is given in both its abelian and tauberian
aspects. A proof may be found, together with a history of the result from Feller [7] to
Stadtm¨uller and Trautner [10], in Bingham, Goldie and Teugels [2], Chapter 2, Theorem
2.10.1, pp. 116–118, and Korevaar [9], Chapter IV, Theorem 10.1, pp. 197–199.

Let C(y), D(y) be non-negative real-valued functions on the non-negative reals, non-

decreasing and right continuous. To each corresponds a Laplace transform, typically

If, for some constant A and slowly-oscillating function L(y),

y → ∞,

then

Further, if D∗(y) → 1 as y → 1+, then the converse is valid.

bC(s) = (AL(s−1) + o(1))bD(s),

s → 0 + .

Remark. The non-decreasing nature of D ensures that lim D∗(y), y → 1, exists.
Completion of the proof of Theorem 1. We apply Lemma 4 to the pair 2G(ex) + Re (H(ex)),
G(ex); to the pair with Im (H(ex)) in place of Re (H(ex)); and to the pair G(ex), G(ex).

Computation with Euler products shows bC(s), bD(s), the Laplace transforms of the ﬁrst
pair, to exist for all positive s and satisfy bC(s) = f (s)bD(s), where
f (s) − 2 = ReYp  1 +

In particular,

|f (s) − 2| ≪ exp −Xp

p−1−s(g(p) − Re h(p))! ,

so that if the series in the exponent diverges for s = 0, then f (s) → 2 as s → 0+, and we
may apply Lemma 4 with A = 2, L identically 1.

From the Chebyshev bound π(y) ≪ y(log y)−1, integration by parts shows the series

We may therefore assume the seriesP p−1(g(p) − Re h(p)) to converge.
Pp>xε p−1 exp(− log p/ log x) to be bounded in terms of ε alone. Since

|g(p) − h(p)|2 ≤ 2g(p)(g(p) − Re h(p)),

an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, conﬁned to the primes on which g does not
vanish, shows that

p−1−1/ log x|g(p) − h(p)| ≪ Xp>xε

g(p)p−1−1/ log x!1/2 Xp>xε

Moreover,

from which Theorem 1 follows rapidly.

Let 0 ≤ g(p) ≤ β for each prime, p.

p−1 log p ≥ τ.

The converse need not be true, as may be seen from the example λ0 in section 2.

8

P. D. T. A. ELLIOTT

However, the following converse is valid.

Lemma 5. Assume that for c > 0 and each ε, 0 < ε < 1, the function g(p), uniformly
bounded on the primes, satisﬁes

Then for each α, 0 < α < c, there is a subsequence of primes, r, such that

p−1g(p) log p ≥ c.

r−1g(r) log r = α.

Proof of Lemma 5. We begin with an outline of the argument. Fix a prime t for which

We deﬁne a function g(p) by choosing, for each prime p, to retain g(p) or to replace it

Pp≤t p−1g(p) log p ≥ α log t.
by zero. For ease of notationPp≤y p−1g(p) log p will be denoted by S(y).

We choose g(p) = g(p) for p ≤ t.

The primes y1 < y2 < · · · are deﬁned successively as follows. We replace g(p) by zero
on the primes following t until, for the ﬁrst time, S(y)/ log y falls strictly below α. The
corresponding value of y is y1.

We choose g(p) = g(p) on the primes p > y1 until, for the ﬁrst time with y > y1, the

ratio S(y)/ log y climbs above α. The corresponding value of y is y2; and so on.

Our initial aim is to show the turning values yj not to be logarithmically far apart.

A few preliminary remarks are helpful.
Let 0 < θ < 1, x ≥ 2, 3/2 ≤ y ≤ xθ. With 0 < ε < 1 − θ determine the integer k by
= ψ, so that k ≥ 2. Assume that for all suﬃciently large values of w

x(1−ε)k < y ≤ x(1−ε)k−1

Xw1−ε<p≤w

p−1g(p) log p ≥ εc log w.

By partitioning the interval (x(1−ε)k , x] into adjoining subintervals (x(1−ε)m, x(1−ε)m−1
1, 2, . . . , k, we see that provided x(1−ε)k is suﬃciently large in terms of ε,

For the purposes of proving Lemma 5 we may therefore replace its lower-bound hypoth-

It is clear that the initial prime t exists.

As a second preliminary remark, if 2 ≤ y ≤ w, then

In particular, if y is a prime adjacent to a turning value yk, then

S(y)/ log y − S(yk)/ log yk ≪ (| log(yk/y)| + 1)/ log yk ≪ 1/ log yk,

since the ratio of successive increasing primes approaches 1.

For the range x1−ε < u ≤ x, v ≤ xε and we may invert summations, replacing (c − α)/2,

A similar estimate holds for M.

Letting x → ∞, ε → 0+ completes the proof.

6. Proof of Theorem 4

Case (i). From the assumption that the seriesP p−1(g(p) − Re (h(p)pit)) converges, for each

positive δ the series taken over the primes p for which g(p) − Re (h(p)pit) > δ also converges.

On the remaining primes

|g(p) − h(p)pit|2 ≤ 2g(p)(g(p) − Re (h(p)pit)) ≤ 2βδ.

The values of h(p)pit lie in a box about the real axis, with corners at (−(2βδ)1/2, ±(2βδ)1/2),
(β + (2βδ)1/2, ±(2βδ)1/2), and area 2(2βδ)1/2(β + 2(2βδ)1/2).

We would like to integrate by parts and remove the weight nit from h(n)nit, but have
insuﬃcient control over the values of the function h. Since, in some sense, we are considering
the ratio h(n)nit(g(n))−1, at an appropriate moment we switch the weight nit from h to g
and consider the ratio h(n)(g(n)n−it)−1.

Following the argument for Theorem 3, the study of the sum Pn≤x h(n) is reduced to

that of

Remark. Under the hypothesis of Case (i) the seriesP p−1|g(p) − h(p)pit|2 converges. The

to converge.

Suppose further that, for some positive integer k, h(p)k is real. The inequality |1 − zk| ≤

k|1 − z|, valid for every z in the complex unit disc, guarantees the seriesP p−1g(p)|1 − p2ikt|2
In the present circumstances Pp≤x p−1g(p) ≥ (c + o(1)) log log x as x → ∞ and an

application of Lemma 15 from Elliott and Kish [5] shows that t = 0.

A simple example is given by h(n) = g(n)χ(n), where χ is a Dirichlet character.

The argument of this remark may be given a topological aspect by deﬁning a metric

σ(f, g) = (P p−1|f (p) − g(p)|2)1/2 on equivalence classes of multiplicative functions that

coincide of the primes, and restricting study to those functions g whose distance σ(g, g0) to a
ﬁxed multiplicative function g0 is deﬁned, i.e. ﬁnite. The topological space of complex-valued
multiplicative functions is in this manner locally metrised and correspondingly disconnected.

7. Proof of Theorem 6

We assume the new, weaker restraints upon g.

i.e. g(pk) = g(p)k/k!, and |g(p)| ≤ β, then for any γ the series Pp,k≥2 p−k|g(pk)|(log pk)γ

converges, so that Theorem 4 is applicable. Indeed, for such functions the original exposition
of Elliott and Kish, [6] Theorem 2, already contains a proof.

If g is exponentially multiplicative,

In general, we deﬁne an exponentially multiplicative function g1 by g1(p) = g(p), and a

complementary multiplicative function g2 by Dirichlet convolution: g = g1 ∗ g2.

Calculation with Euler products shows that g2(p) = 0 and for k ≥ 2,

g2(pk) =

(r!)−1(−g(p))rg(pk−r).

In particular,

We choose δ to satisfy 1 − δc0 = δc. The earlier condition 2δβc < β + c is amply satisﬁed,

c0 increases with β and δc descends to a limiting value c(3c + 1)−1.

8. Concluding Remarks

The hypothesis on |g| in Theorem 6 remains essentially weaker than that on g in Theorem
4. What might a best-possible condition on g be in order to guarantee the validity of Theorem
4?

Likewise, what might the weakest hypothesis on g be in order to guarantee the validity

of the lower bound in Theorem 2?
