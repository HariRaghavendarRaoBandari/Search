ABSTRACT

We report serendipitous detections of line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 3, 6,
and 7 in the central parsec down to within 1(cid:48)(cid:48) around Sgr A* at an up to now highest resolution (<0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) view of the Galactic Center
(GC) in the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) domain. From the 100 GHz continuum and the H39α emission we obtain a uniform electron
temperature around Te ∼ 6000 K for the minispiral. The spectral index of Sgr A* is ∼ 0.5 at 100 - 250 GHz and ∼ 0.0 at 230 -
340 GHz. The bright sources in the center show spectral indices (S ∝ να) around -0.1 implying Bremsstrahlung emission, while dust
emission is emerging in the minispiral exterior. Apart from CS, which is most widespread in the center, also H13CO+, HC3N, SiO, SO,
C2H, CH3OH, 13CS and N2H+ are detected. The bulk of the clumpy emission regions is at positive velocities and in a region conﬁned
by the minispiral Northern Arm, Bar and the sources IRS 3 and 7. Though partly spatially overlapping with the radio recombination
line (RRL) emission at same negative velocities, the relation to the minispiral remains unclear. A likely explanation is an infalling
clump consisting of denser cloud cores embedded in diﬀuse gas. The central association of clouds shows three times higher CS/X
(X: any other observed molecule) ratios than the circumnuclear disk (CND) suggesting a combination of higher excitation - by a
temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping - and abundance enhancement due to UV- and/or X-ray emission. Hence, we conclude that
this central association is closer to the center than the CND. Moreover, we ﬁnd molecular emission at velocities up to 200 km s−1. We
identiﬁed two intriguing regions in the CND. One shows emission in all molecular species and higher energy levels tested in this and
previous observations and contains a methanol class I maser. The other one shows similar behaviour of the line ratios like the central
association. Outside the CND, we ﬁnd the traditionally quiescent gas tracer N2H+ coinciding with the largest infrared (IR) dark clouds
in the ﬁeld. Methanol emission is found at and around previously detected methanol class I masers in the same region. We propose
to make these particular regions subject to further studies in the scope of hot/cold core and extreme photon/X-ray dominated region
(PDR/XDR) chemistry and consequent star formation in the central few parsecs.

1. Introduction
The inner few parsecs of our Milky Way are a very fascinating
and complicated region where we have the opportunity to study
the interaction of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with its
environment on the smallest possible spatial scales. Our SMBH,
Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is located at the heart of a nuclear stellar
cluster of massive stars (e.g. Serabyn & Lacy 1985; Krabbe et al.
1991), and together they are situated at the focal point of three
infalling ionized gas streamers, called the minispiral or Sgr A
West (e.g. Lo & Claussen 1983; Roberts & Goss 1993; Zhao
et al. 2009).
The minisprial is not only visible in thermal emission of ion-
ized gas but also of hot dust (T ∼ 200 K, Gezari et al. 1985;
Cotera et al. 1999; Viehmann et al. 2006; Lau et al. 2013). Sev-

(cid:63) based on ALMA observations under

the project number

2011.0.00887.S, which were executed on 18 May 2012.

eral stars from the nuclear stellar cluster are interacting with the
streamers by either just passing through them and forming bow-
shocks or by being embedded into them. Furthermore, the ex-
treme youth (∼ 106 yr) of many of them suggests these stars to
have formed in situ and challenges our current understanding of
star formation in such environments (e.g. Nayakshin et al. 2007).
Two of the minispiral arms seem to be part of the inner ionized
edge of the circumnuclear disk (CND) of molecular gas. The
CND structure extends from 1.5 pc to about 2.5 pc (e.g. Guesten
et al. 1987; Jackson et al. 1993; Marr et al. 1993; Yusef-Zadeh
et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2001; Christopher et al. 2005) and is
connected via molecular gas streamers, especially in the south
and the west, to larger cloud associations ultimately related to
the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) - M-0.02-0.07 (50 km s−1-
cloud) and M-0.13-0.08 (20 km s−1-cloud), in the east and south
of the CND (Coil & Ho 1999, 2000; Liu et al. 2012).

Earlier large scale molecular studies of the Galactic center
(GC), such as the ones mentioned above, suggested the central
cavity inside the CND to be devoid of molecular gas and to con-
tain only neutral and ionized material. However, indications for
the opposite have been accumulating in the past in the form of
CO, H2CO, H+
3 and OH absorption features (Geballe et al. 1989;
Goto et al. 2014; Karlsson et al. 2003, 2015) as well as high res-
olution maps of CN and high energy transitions of HCN and CS
(Montero-Castaño et al. 2009; Martín et al. 2012). In addition,
Moultaka et al. (2004, 2005, 2015a,b) conﬁrmed the ubiquitous
presence of water and CO ice in the minispiral.

With the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submil-
limeter Array (ALMA) we have access to the spatial resolution
and sensitivity required to study the molecular-gas content in this
region. We report the serendipitous detection of line emission in
the central parsec up to within 1(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 0.04 pc) around Sgr A* in
projection. The ALMA data used was obtained from the archive
at an angular resolution of down to (cid:46)0.5(cid:48)(cid:48). At the distance to
the Galactic Center of - here we adopt 8±0.3kpc (Schödel et al.
2002; Eisenhauer et al. 2003; Horrobin et al. 2004; Ghez et al.
2008; Gillessen et al. 2009a,b) - this corresponds to about 28
mpc or 5775 AU. This allows the so far highest angular and spa-
tial view on the GC in the sub-mm domain. Among the high-
lights are: the very ﬁrst 350 GHz map of the minispiral, the
very ﬁrst and highly resolved detection of molecular emission
in the immediate vicinity of the SMBH, and the highly resolved
structures of CND features, especially of a region comprising a
methanol class I maser closest to the SMBH.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give a
detailed description of the observations including the calibration
and line and continuum imaging. Results and data analysis are
given in Section 3. The global results on radio continuum and
radio recombination lines are given in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The
molecular gas emission in the outer and inner region (i.e. beyond
and within the central 40” of the Galactic Center) including re-
sults from a few special regions are described in Section 3.3 and
3.4. The results and analysis of the molecular gas kinematics
are presented in Section 3.5. In the discussion in Section 4 we
concentrate on the continuum spectral index (Sect. 4.1) the elec-
tron temperature (Sect. 4.2) and the emission towards some of
the most prominent stellar sources in the central stellar cluster
(Sect. 4.3). Molecular line ratios including molecular excitation
and abundances are discussed in Section 4.4. In Section 5 we de-
scribe the general nature of the molecular gas towards the central
region of the Milky Way. Here we concentrate on the infrared
dark clouds and methanol masers (Sect. 5.1), the high velocity
clouds (Sect. 5.2), and the origin of the molecular gas in the cen-
tral region (Sect. 5.3). As summary is given in Section 6. We
present additional images and tables in online appendices A - E.

2. ALMA observations and data reduction

The Galactic Center is one of the most complex regions in the
Milky Way. A detailed analysis requires high sensitivity and
angular resolution. Both can now be obtained using ALMA.
For the presented description and analysis we used Galac-
tic Center data obtained in a monitoring campaign, under the
project 2011.0.00887.S (PI: Heino Falcke), on 18 May 2012 with
ALMA in Band 3, 6, and 7 alternatingly. A summary of the ob-
servational properties per band is given in Table 1.

2.1. Observation

For the observations in the three bands the corresponding cen-
tral frequencies were tuned to ∼ 100, 250, and 340 GHz, re-
spectively. Using the Time Division Mode, the correlator pro-
vides 128 channels with a width of 15.625 MHz resulting in a
total bandwidth of the spectral window of 2 GHz. This translates
to velocity channel widths of ∼ 50, 20, and 15 km s−1, respec-
tively. Each band contains 4 spectral windows yielding a total
eﬀective bandwidth of 8 GHz. The single pointing on Sgr A*
(17h.45m. 40s.040, -29◦.00(cid:48).28(cid:48)(cid:48).118, J2000) covers a ﬁeld of view
(FOV) of ∼ 60, 23, and 17(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. During the observa-
tions, the array was in its most extended conﬁguration (in cycle
0) with baselines ranging from 36 to 400 m. This results in an-
gular resolutions of about 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48), 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48), and 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.

The total observation time is 7.5 h and the integration time
per target and band is of the order of 20 min. Using 19 antennas
and distributing the scans per band equally over the whole obser-
vation time yields a superb uv-coverage. With this conﬁguration,
the instrument is sensitive in the diﬀerent FOVs to angular scales
< 10(cid:48)(cid:48), < 4(cid:48)(cid:48) and < 3(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.

2.2. Data calibration

The basic reduction and calibration was performed with the
Common Astronomy Software Application (CASAv3.4 Mc-
Mullin et al. 2007) using the reduction scripts provided with the
archive data. The uncertainty in the ﬂux calibration is less than
17%, 9%, and 10% in band 3, 6, and 7, respectively. All further
reduction, imaging, and analysis were carried out in CASAv.4.3.
We inspected the visibilities and ﬂagged residual noisy data. The
ﬂux variability of Sgr A* produces strong sidelobes in the time-
integrated image such that the underlying fainter extended emis-
sion, which is a main focus of our investigation, is not visible.
Hence we performed an elaborate and careful self-calibration not
only on phase but also on amplitude, despite the variable nature
of the source. Phase-only self-calibration enhances the dynamic
range (DR) only by a factor of 1.7, 6.4, and 6.2 at 100, 250, and
340 GHz, respectively. Combining it with a subsequent ampli-
tude and eventually an amplitude-phase self-calibration yields a
total improvement of the DR by a factor of 11.4, 31.9, and 57.7,
respectively. Therefore, by trading astrometric and time resolu-
tion information of the data, we were able to increase the DR
dramatically, i.e. to 4500, 7600, and 11200, respectively, result-
ing in an overall data quality suﬃcient for our purpose. The sub-
traction of the continuum from the uv-data gave access to the
emission line information. A description of the procedures for
the extraction of the line and continuum maps is given in the
following section.

2.3. Line and continuum imaging

Apart from the continuum emission, created by using the line-
free channels, we indeed identiﬁed a large number of lines above
the 3 - 5 σ noise level in the diﬀerent bands (see Table 2). Here
we describe the general procedure we followed for the creation
of of line and continuum images. We also outline some general
properties of the diﬀerent spacial and spectral features in the data
cubes as far as they are relevant for the calibration of image
formation. We weighted the line and continuum data naturally
and restored the images with 768 × 768 pixels and a pixel size
of 0.15, 0.075, and 0.05 (cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. In this way the images
cover twice the FOV. The channel resolution corresponds to the
natural channel size of the corresponding spectral window. The

Notes. listed are the frequencies ν; upper state energies Eu; critical densities ncrit in the two-level approximation for given kinetic temperature
based on data from the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA, Schöier et al. 2005, http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/∼moldata/); beam
sizes θbeam, channel noise σch-rms, and noise clipping level from nclipσch-rms per line cube; velocity range vint over which the integrated ﬂux maps
have been obained.

noise rms is 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 mJy beam−1 for the continuum, and
0.5, 1.0, and 1.6 mJy beam−1 for a channel. We created the mo-
ment maps, i.e. integrated ﬂux (0th order) and velocity ﬁeld (1st
order), by using the CASA task immoments.
All line (cube channels) and continuum data were clipped at
≥ 3σ to avoid the inclusion of noise and dilution eﬀects. Sub-
sequently, all moment 0 maps, i.e. integrated ﬂux maps, and the
continuum maps are corrected for the primary beam attenuation
out to a primary beam level of 10%. In the following, we refer to
the ﬁeld given by the 10% power full width as FOV10 (see Table
1). The accuracy of the primary beam corrected ﬂuxes will suﬀer
with distance from the pointing center due to the decreasing sen-
sitivity of the primary beam. Nevertheless, many bright features
are detected beyond the FOV making an extension of the map to
the FOV10 preferable.

The minispiral, as the outstanding extended emission com-
ponent in the region, is well detected in the 100, 250, and 350
GHz continuum (Fig. 2) and in the Hα and β radio recombina-

tion line (RRL) emission in band 3 (Fig. 3). The H49β and H51β
lines are partly blended by faint H61δ and H58γ line emission,
respectively, which are oﬀset by about -300 and -500 km s−1
compared to H49β and H51β, respectively. In band 6, the Hβ
line is fainter and rather tracing compact features. Furthermore,
it overlaps with the H13CO+ line emission in frequency space
such that emission from both, Hβ and H13CO+ lines, appear in
the integrated ﬂux maps. The Hβ line in band 7 is very weak and
only reliably detected in the IRS 2 and 13.
The hydrogen recombination line emission is visible from −400
(−600 for Hα) to 400 km s−1. The molecular emission lines in
band 3 cover the whole CND velocity range of -150 to 150 km
s−1. Due to the smaller FOV10, molecular emission lines in band
6 and 7 typically appear in channel ranges from -80 (-100) km
s−1 to 80 (100) km s−1. Only CS extends to higher velocities up
to 200 km s−1 and SiO covers the largest range from -160 to
200 km s−1. The resulting images are displayed in Figure 5. The
image cubes of N2H+ and C2H suﬀer from strong sidelobe arte-

facts in some channels, visible as ring structure around the po-
sition of Sgr A*. Therefore, for N2H+ we doubt the ring shaped
structures in the inner 12(cid:48)(cid:48) and the emission of C2H needs to be
treated with caution since obvious real emission is blended with
the sidelobes. In addition, the emission on Sgr A* in several band
6 and 7 lines is likely to be a residual of an imperfect/insuﬃcient
continuum subtraction.

2.4. Obtaining spectral and spatial properties of the sources
We catalogued all clumps with prominent molecular emission
with their positions, source sizes, ﬂuxes, and spectral features
in all the molecular emission lines (see Tables B.1 and C.1 -
C.3). In the continuum images we looked for counterparts of
the sources detected in the IR (Muži´c et al. 2007; Viehmann
et al. 2006, ﬁnding charts therein) and cm-emission (Zhao et al.
2009, ﬁnding charts therein) to obtain their positions, source
sizes, and ﬂuxes (see Table B.1). For a selection of IR sources
in the inner 10(cid:48)(cid:48), we extracted the spectral properties (see Fig.
D.1). Positions, sizes and contained ﬂuxes were derived with
the CASAv4.3 task imfit ﬁtting a 2D-Gaussian to the naturally
weighted, untapered (integrated) image. Spectra were obtained
from a beamsized aperture as given in Table 2 centered on the
average position of each clump based on all emission lines and
were ﬁtted with the MPFIT module in Python1. In this context,
one has to bear in mind that the emission lines cover often only
2 - 3 channels so that the spectral line ﬁtting can be challenging
and the actual uncertainty in the ﬁt is larger than calculated. In
such cases and in cases, where the ﬁt fails despite a 3σ detection
of a line, we estimate the uncertainties and/or the parameters.
We calculated the line luminosity ratios for selected molecules
based on the channel ﬂuxes (Table E.1) as well as continuum
spectral index maps and integrated line ﬂux to continuum ratio
maps. The results are discussed in section 4. For ratios between
two maps we uv-tapered and restored the images with the same
beam size per ratio. Ideally, the uv-planes should be clipped to
the same range for ratios between diﬀerent ALMA bands. How-
ever, this reduced the image quality so signiﬁcantly, i.e. distor-
tions and ﬂux losses of up to 50 % even when clipping only
large baselines, that we refrained from applying this procedure.
Therefore, ratios between a higher and a lower band can only be
considered as lower limit due to the missing ﬂux resolved out in
the higher band data. In contrast to this, ratios within the same
band will be very accurate in terms of the similarity of the uv-
plane coverage and ﬂux calibration. The only bias is introduced
by the channel binning on the same grid, due to unreliable in-
terpolation in uv-plane regions with scarce sampling and/or low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the cleaning procedure. These
eﬀects are diﬃcult to constrain. Since the SNR per channel is
less than for the total band, we treat the molecular line ratios per
channel as rough values and omit the uncertainties. For track-
ing trends in the molecular line ratios by region this procedure is
suﬃcient.

3. Results and Analysis
In the following we present the main results of the ALMA data
including both continuum and lines. The complexity of the re-
gion results in a number of prominent features or objects dis-
tributed throughout the region.

For the orientation of the reader we give in Fig. 1 a ﬁnding
chart for the names of the features used in this paper. Following

the CND-nomenclature of Christopher et al. (2005) and Martín
et al. (2012) the CND’s most dominant regions are the North-
eastern (NE) and Southwestern (SW) lobe. The southeast side
of the ring is called Southern Extension (SE). The Northeast-
ern Extension (NEE) is coincident with the eastern edge of the
minispiral’s Northern Arm (NA), while the CND-Northern Arm
(CNA) is on the west side of the NA. East of the CND is the
Northeastern Arm (NEA) located.

At this occasion, it is useful to deﬁne further regions that
will be discussed in this paper: SEW is a small clump at the
northwestern end of the SE. SEE is the large cloud extending
east of the middle of the SE. The triop is located at the southern
tip of the CNA and the V-cloud’s eastern edge coincides with
the southern tip of the NEA. In addition, we use the minispiral-
nomenclature of Paumard et al. (2004) to describe the features in
the ionized gas emission: The brightest part of the minispiral is
within the so-called Bar extending from west to the south of the
SMBH. The NA extends north parallel to the NEE, the Western
Arc (WA) is parallel to the SW CND Lobe and the Eastern Arm
(EA) streams towards the center from the east. The latter can
be subdivided into the Ribbon comprising most of the EA, the
Tip, a luminous section between the Ribbon and the Bar, and the
Eastern Bridge (EB), visible as vertical connection between the
NA and the Ribbon.

For the description of the innermost region around Sgr A* it

is helpful to use the IRS sources as reference points (Fig. 1).

3.1. Continuum
Figure 2 shows the continuum emission at 100, 250, and 340
GHz. Overall, the minispiral is well detected in all three contin-
uum maps.

The 100 GHz continuum emission traces well the arms of
the minispiral in their overall extent and prominent clumps with
them. The resolution of the 100 GHz ALMA map is compara-
ble to the data of e.g. Lo & Claussen (1983) at 6 cm (VLA).
The brightest emission after Sgr A* comes from the IRS13/ 2L
complex and the ridge in the IRS 16/21/33 region (see Fig.1 for
orientation). Furthermore, the IRS 1W , 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 regions
are discernible. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd some diﬀerences in the
morphology with respect to the 6 cm map: We notice a southeast
extension at the eastern end of the EA to a cloud slightly to the
south (∆α ∼ 17(cid:48)(cid:48), ∆δ ∼ −5(cid:48)(cid:48)). While this faint cloud (peak ﬂux
∼ 10 mJy/beam) is not visible in the low frequency (≤ 20 GHz)
observations, except from a tentatively detected extension (e.g.
Lo & Claussen 1983; Roberts & Goss 1993; Zhao et al. 2009),
it seems to be visible in the 1.3 mm map of Kunneriath et al.
(2012a) and the extension towards it is clearly seen in the MIR,
both suggestive of a dusty nature. This clump is located between
the northern tip of the CND SE and a CND clump east of the
eastern end of the EA.

At 250 GHz the major ﬁlaments start to resolve, i.e. in the
NA: the ﬁlaments X1, NE 1, 3, and 4; in the Bar: SW 6, 7, 8 (S
of IRS 2L), 3 (W of IRS 13); and in the Tip: X2 (ﬁlament nomen-
clature: Muži´c et al. 2007). The dust features X5 (Tip, north of
IRS 9), SW 2, 4, and X6 (IRS 6 region) are located at the edges of
the radio continuum emission. Moreover, the IRS13 cluster and
IRS 2L are separated, and the ridge in the IRS 16/21/33 region
is displaying a substructure within which the ﬁlament NE4 and
IRS 21 are discernible. In the NA, IRS 5 (bowshock to the north-
east) and sources east (most eastern: IRS 17) of it emerge (IRS
5S, 5SE1, 5SE2, 17) as well as IRS 10W, 16NE, 16C, VISIR
60/K 22 (Viehmann et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2009) - both next to
Sgr A*-, and K 42 (Zhao et al. 2009) at the center of the mini-

192, 384, 1920, 4800] × σ (= 0.5 mJy beam−1), and central 20(cid:48)(cid:48) at 340 GHz with 250 GHz contours of [6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, 1920,

cavity. In addition, we notice a positional shift of IRS 7 from the
100 GHz to the 250 GHz map of < 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to the S(W), which is
either due to the lower resolution at 100 GHz unable to separate
the star or bowshock head from the tail or to diﬀerent excitation
conditions in the head and the tail.

While the 250 GHz continuum traces the extended gas in the
minispiral, the high resolution image at 350 GHz perfectly out-
lines the compact features as seen in the MIR and in the radio
(compare Viehmann et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2009). Additional
ﬁlaments are visible at 350 GHz are X3 and SW5, southeast and
southwest of IRS 13, respectively. Besides the IRS 13 cluster be-
gins to separate into the 13N and 13E clusters at this resolution.

3.2. Radio recombination lines

Figure 3 shows the emission of the brightest RRLs in this dataset.
Further RRL images can be seen in Fig. A.1. The bright emission
in the H39α line mimics very closely the distribution of the 100
GHz continuum. Only towards the edge of the FOV10 the low
sensitivity of the primary beam becomes notable - neither IRS 8
(∆α ∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48), ∆δ ∼ 28(cid:48)(cid:48)) nor the southern tip of the WA are properly
detected. The clump south of the EA end, which is even fainter
than the diﬀuse WA emission at 100 GHz, is not detected.

In the following we compare the general brightness distribu-
tion in the RRL emission to that in the radio continuum and to

H36β overlayed with the 250 GHz contours as in Fig. 2. H49β and H33β can be seen in Fig. A.1. The beam sizes are 1.9(cid:48)(cid:48) × 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48), 1.8(cid:48)(cid:48) × 1.4(cid:48)(cid:48), and

the results of corresponding radio cm-wavelength observations.
When comparing our data to the H92α and Ne ii data of Zhao
et al. (2009) and Irons et al. (2012), respectively, we spot some
diﬀerences: In the integrated H92α emission image displayed in
Zhao et al. (2009), the region southeast of Sgr A*, i.e. outlined
by IRS 21, 16SW, 33, is fainter close to Sgr A* and peaks south
of IRS 33 (see Fig.1 for orientation). This trend is opposite to
what is seen in our data. Furthermore, the middle part of the EA
is very weak and the Tip is weaker than the eastern end of EA.
In the Ne ii data of Irons et al. (2012), the region between IRS
13, 21, 33 is fainter than IRS 1W and 2L, which might simply
be related to a diﬀerent excitation behaviour of the Ne ion, but
the H30α data of Zhao et al. (2010) looks similar. On the one
hand, our RRL maps might be aﬀected by the large velocity bins
it has been observed with, i.e. ∼ 50 km s−1. This is implied by
the slight discrepancies between the H49β and H51β maps. The
line transitions are close enough to each other so that opacity
changes - if signiﬁcant at all at 100 GHz - or deviations from
LTE cannot explain the diﬀerences. Therefore, an instrumental
bias cannot be ruled out.

The observations of Zhao et al. (2009, 2010) and Irons et al.
(2012) have been conducted at a spatial resolution similar to our
data, but with a much higher spectral resolution of ∼ 15 km s−1
and ∼ 4 km s−1, respectively, suggesting the minispiral clumps to
be well traced. On the other hand, the region south(west) of Sgr
A* is the second brightest in all of the three RRL at 100 GHz.
The diﬀerence in the velocity ranges for integration could also
have an impact on the RRL emission distributions from our data
set and theirs: While we integrate the H39α emission from -400
to 400 km s−1, Irons et al. (2012) use a range of -339 - 299 km s−1
and Zhao et al. (2010) a range of -360 - 345 km s−1 even though
faint emission extends to even extremer negative velocities. This
is supported by Br γ, Fe iii, and He i observations discussed in
Steiner et al. (2013) and can also be seen in the Ne ii data cube
of Irons et al. (2012, link on online journal page), both tracing the
ionized gas up to -380 km s−1. The H36β emission outlines the
high SNR regions along the minispiral ﬁlaments and the H33β is
too faint to be reliable, except maybe towards the IRS 2L and 13
region.

3.3. Molecular gas in the outer regions

The large FOV of the band 3 data enables us to look at the full
CND and regions outside of it. With outer regions we refer to a
distance r > 40(cid:48)(cid:48) from Sgr A*. The emission of 13CS, N2H+, and
CH3OH(8–7) is shown in Fig. 4 and compared to the CN data of
Martín et al. (2012). The regions of 13CS and CH3OH(8–7) line
emission are less extended than in the N2H+ line. The 13CS line
emission is faint and restricted to the west side of the CND. It
is also prominent in the SEW and SEE regions (see Fig.1 for
orientation).

N2H+ is found within the CND and partly matching local
peaks in CN emission, but the strongest emission resides in re-
gions outside of it, i.e. in the SEE and in the V-cloud. This is
consistent with the N2H+ and CH3OH(2–1) distribution obtained
from lower resolution (θbeam ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48)) observations by Moser et al.
(2014, 2016). Moreover, the overall distribution resembles very
much the one of H2CO in Martín et al. (2012). Apart from the
molecules just mentioned, the V-cloud has never been detected
that clearly in any other molecule in the past (compare Christo-
pher et al. 2005; Montero-Castaño et al. 2009; Martín et al.
2012). While H2CO has also been well detected in the north-
ern clump of the eastern extension (nomenclature: Christopher
et al. 2005; Martín et al. 2012), the same clump is faint in N2H+.

CH3OH(8–7) is found in CND regions close to the center, in
the clump east of the SE and along the eastern edge of V-cloud,
that is part of the eastern extension. This is supported by the
observations of Moser et al. (2014, 2016) where the CH3OH(2–
1) emission is brighter in the eastern part of the V-cloud than
the western part. The dominant peak in the V-cloud is consistent
with a source radiating 36 GHz and 44 GHz class I methanol
maser emission (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2001; Sjouwerman et al.
2010; Pihlström et al. 2011). The clumps north and south of it co-
incide with local peaks in N2H+ and the most southern one of the
4 clumps is situated in a cavity of N2H+ emission at the V-cloud
edge. The other 36 GHz maser (Sjouwerman et al. 2010) has no
CH3OH(8–7) counterpart. In the SEE cloud, the position of the
CH3OH(8–7) emission coincides with a 36 GHz maser (Sjouw-
erman et al. 2010), but in contrast to the bright point source in the
V-cloud, the CH3OH(8–7) emission appears extended and faint.

The contours at the levels [8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112] × σ (= 1.9 Jy beam−1 km s−1) show CN(2–1) emission of the CND at a resolution of
4.0(cid:48)(cid:48) × 2.6(cid:48)(cid:48) for orientation (compare Fig. 1; CN-data: Martín et al. 2012).

3.4. Molecular gas in the inner 40 arcseconds

In this section, we describe and discuss the features of diﬀerent
molecular emission lines with respect to the line emission of the
J=5-4 transition of the excited density tracer CS, which is the
brightest line in the central region. The integrated ﬂux images of
the lines can be seen in Fig. 5.

The CS line emission is strong, widespread, and clumpy
within the FOV10 of band 6. As expected, CS is found in the
CND, i.e. east and west of the center. In fact, it appears at the
inner edges of the CND. In the east, the CS emission follows
the eastern edge of the extended minispiral emission (e.g. at 100
GHz) and appears intersected by the EA of the minispiral (e.g. at
250 GHz). The maximum in emission lies in the SEW (see Fig.1
for orientation). In the west the emission resides in the triop and
in the northwestern edge of the WA of the minispiral, where the
CS emission is limited to the south by the FOV10 cutoﬀ.

The emission from H13CO+, SiO, SO, and C2H is fainter but
typically found - in diﬀerent fractions - in the strong CS peaks
in the center as well as in the CND, whereas the emission of
13CS, N2H+, and CH3OH(8–7) is rather found towards the CND,
which might also be related to the diﬀerent angular scales traced
in the two ALMA bands.

3.4.1. Triop

In our ALMA data, this structure has an unusual triangular shape
reminiscent of a crustacean shrimp, which is why we gave it the
name triop. This region is visible in all molecular emission lines
in our ALMA data (see also Fig. A.6). We subdivide the region
into the head, which is the wide northeastern part of the triop,
and the tail, which is the thin southwestern part. Most of the
molecular emission lines are predominantly detected towards the
edge facing the GC/nuclear cluster, especially in the center of
the tail and in the southeast clump in the head, which is closest
to the center. The former is the brightest (peak) in all molecules,
except from 13CS and N2H+, which peak rather towards the cen-
ter or the triop. The triop is visible in all molecules detected in
previous studies (e.g. Guesten et al. 1987; Jackson et al. 1993;
Marr et al. 1993; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2001;
Christopher et al. 2005; Montero-Castaño et al. 2009; Martín
et al. 2012), comprising typical density and PDR tracers, such as

HCO+, HCN, CN, as well as highly UV-sensitive species, such
as HC3N. While the shape in the previous studies is rather oval
or triangular due to the larger beam sizes, these ALMA obser-
vations resolve its ﬁlamentary structure for the ﬁrst time. This
region becomes even more extraordinary by its class I methanol
maser emission at 44 GHz, possibly indicating an early phase
of star formation (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2001; Sjouwerman et al.
2010). The maser coincides with the prominent clump in the cen-
ter of the tail and with the peak in CH3OH(8–7) and is thus the
so far closest class I methanol maser to the center.

3.4.2. SEW

The SEW cloud stands out by showing emission in the band 6
molecules, except from HC3N, about as bright as in the triop but
more extended. In contrast to the triop, the emission of N2H+
and CH3OH(8–7) is not detected in this cloud. This is con-
sistent with previous studies (compare Christopher et al. 2005;
Montero-Castaño et al. 2009; Martín et al. 2012) and implies a
less eﬃcient shielding from the UV-ﬁeld than in the triop. In the
CS emission, SEW shows a diameter of 4(cid:48)(cid:48) with a double core in
north-south direction and an elongation from the northwestern
tip to the southwest which appears like a front perpendicular to
the direction to Sgr A* (see also Fig. A.7). Close to this front,
i.e. 1(cid:48)(cid:48) west of the CS peaks lies the maximum of the C2H emis-
sion which extends to the northern CS peak. SO behaves similar
to this but with a larger extent over the CS cores to the east. The
SiO peak is located east of the SO and C2H maxima and slightly
east of the southern CS peak, but still on the northern CS peak
from where it extends to the north and east. Another SiO peak
is on the southern CS maximum itself. Furthest away from the
front facing the center is the H13CO+ emission displaying a peak
between the northern CS and SiO maximum from where it ex-
tends to the northeast similar to SiO.
Additional smaller H13CO+ peaks are found 1(cid:48)(cid:48) east and west
of the southern CS core, where the former is consistent with the
eastern edge of the SO emission and the latter with southern edge
of the C2H peak. The 13CS emission is strong at the CS maxima
and also in a region at northeastern edge of SEW. For this line,
the lower resolution and larger scales traced in band 3 have to
be taken into account. The spatial distribution of the line emis-

respectively.

sion from the diﬀerent molecules with respect to the direction
to Sgr A* and the nuclear stellar cluster suggests some kind of
stratiﬁcation of the emission.

3.4.3. The central 20 arcseconds

It is remarkable that there is CS emission within a (projected)
radius of < 8(cid:48)(cid:48) around the SMBH (see also Figs. A.3, A.3, and
A.5). It extends over the location where the bar of the minispiral
meets the NA to the region north of Sgr A* where it appears to
be outlined by the inner edge of the bar and the NA facing Sgr
A*. The latter contains two prominent features: one region ex-
tends from 2(cid:48)(cid:48) northwest from Sgr A* parallel to the bar towards
the northwest with a length of about 3(cid:48)(cid:48) (SE-NW cloud) and the
other extends from 4(cid:48)(cid:48) north of Sgr A* northwards with a length
of 4(cid:48)(cid:48) and a slight tilt to the east (NS cloud). Both regions seem to
comprise 2 - 3 clumps. Comparing with the continuum emission,
the center of the NS cloud coincides with the ionized emission
from IRS 7.

The CS emission southeast of Sgr A* consists of two clumps,
one covering a triangular region given by the IRS 16 southern
cluster, IRS 16 SE2 and 16SE3 (35), and IRS 21, the other out-

lining the eastern inner edge of the minicavity. Parts of these
clumps are tentatively also detected in C2H, but contaminated by
a sidelobe. South of this conﬁguration the CS emission is found
in the EA nearby IRS 9. Furthermore, CS is present in small
regions immediately north and south of IRS 1W, which else are
only detected in C2H. In addition, the CS emission extends along
the north-south connection between the northern and the east-
ern arm (compare MIR images in Fig. 6), where also H13CO+,
SiO, SO, and C2H are detected. Except from these regions the
CS emission seems to avoid the inner minispiral, especially the
IRS 13 to IRS 2 region. The SE-NW cloud reaches from the
IRS 29 sources to the southwest of IRS 3. These two positions
mark two clumps clearly visible in all band 6 emission lines.
There are fainter extensions in CS emission on IRS 3 itself and
to the northwestern edge of the IRS 3 dust shell. The latter is
remarkably bright in HC3N and CH3OH(7–6) - both not reliably
detected elsewhere in the central 12(cid:48)(cid:48)- , and slightly in H13CO+,
implying a change in the ISM conditions. The southern part of
the NS cloud originates in a region almost between IRS 3 and 7,
passes IRS 7 slightly southwest of it in a second clump and pro-
longs to the northeast to a third clump, but not along the tail of
IRS 7 (MIR image). These clumps are also detected in H13CO+,

SiO, SO, and C2H. Another clump indicated by all band 6 lines
is halfway between IRS 16CC and IRS 7. Emission of CS, SiO,
SO, C2H, and CH3OH(7–6) is also found at the southwestern
edge of the Bar, i.e. south of IRS 6E and 6W.

Apart from HC3N and CH3OH(7–6), SiO shows a peculiar
deviation from the distribution of the CS detected gas: The two
SiO clumps southeast of IRS 1W and southwest of IRS 12, ﬁrst
reported by Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2013, clump 1 & 2 and clump 11;
YZ1-2 and YZ11 hereafter), are both detected in SiO(6–5), while
only the ﬁrst is detected in SiO(8–7). There is no other emission
line present in the immediate vicinity at the corresponding ve-
locities except from faint CS emission northeast of IRS 1W and
south of IRS 21.

Two other prominent SiO point sources seen in both tran-
sitions coincide in position and velocities (see Fig. 7) with the
SiO maser stars IRS 7 and IRS 10EE (Reid et al. 2007; Li et al.
2010). IRS 10EE corresponds to clump 3 (YZ3) in Yusef-Zadeh
et al. (2013).

3.5. Kinematics in the inner 40 arcseconds

In the following we describe the kinematics in a central main ve-
locity range between about -100 km s−1 and +100 km s−1 and
higher velocities beyond the limits of this interval. In general,
one can expect that the high velocity features can be attributed
to either kinetically more active regions (due to outﬂows or cloud
collisions) or the regions that are physically closer (<10(cid:48)(cid:48) or
0.4 pc) to the center. In order to disentangle the cloud complexes
and study the motion of the molecular and ionized gas, we plot
the channels maps between -140 km s−1 and 200 (220) km s−1
for CS and SiO in comparison to H36β in Fig. 7. The given chan-
nel velocities denote the lower edge of the channels which have
a width of 20 km s−1. Details on the spectral properties of the
regions can be found in the Tables C.1 - C.3, and D.1.

3.5.1. Main velocity range
The main range of the velocities of about -100 km s−1 and +100
km s−1 in the inner 40(cid:48)(cid:48) is given by the velocities of the molecu-
lar gas clumps within this cutout of the CND. However, in Fig. 7,
we start at -140 km s−1 to show the SiO emission in IRS 7, which
is visible from channel -140 km s−1 to -100 km s−1. This is con-

21 with an elongation in northsouth direction and in the western
end of the bar, i.e. between IRS 6E and 6W. The ﬁrst CS emis-
sion regions appearing between channel -80 to -40 km s−1 are

small (r ∼ 2(cid:48)(cid:48)) clumps in the NA, i.e. between the EA/IRS21 and
IRS 1W, between IRS 1W, 10 and maybe 5, and south of and
IRS 7. In the channel range from -40 to 0 km s−1 the large CS
cloud in the minispiral, and south and east of Sgr A* emerges
and extends from the eastern edge of the minicavity to 1W with
the thickness of the NA in that region. At the same time IRS

10EE is visible in SiO emission around the expected velocity of
-27 km s−1 and a line width of 5 - 10 km s−1 (Reid et al. 2007;
Li et al. 2010). The hydrogen recombination line emission in the
channel range of -80 to 0 km s−1 moves northeast from IRS 21
to 1W and appears in this way mostly at the northeastern edge of
the central extended CS emission clump or is surrounded by it.
These are also the channels in which the SEW arises in CS and
SiO, peaking around -40 km s−1. In the channels -40 and -20 km
s−1, we make out a faint apparent connection between SEW and
the extended central CS clump south of Sgr A*.

From channel -20 km s−1 onwards the SEW emission turns
into the eastern CND, passing the EA and extending northwards
along the NA until the channel of 60 km s−1. We note small CS
clumps nearby or at the dusty sources east of IRS 5 (Perger et al.
2008) and IRS 5 itself between channels 20 to 60 km s−1.

The CS emission within the minispiral in channels above 0
km s−1 is not strong or widespread anymore. Instead the bulk
of the molecular gas at velocities between 20 to 100 km s−1 is
found in the region delineated by the NA, the Bar, IRS 3, and 7,
with an southwestern extension across the bar, i.e. to the south-

east of IRS6W, and a collection of small clumps between the
southwest of the Bar and the WA in the velocity range of 40
to 80 km s−1. SiO emission appears in several CS peaks in this
region and velocity range. Meanwhile, the H36β line emission
proceeds from IRS 1W northwards to IRS 5. It does not overlap
with the CS emission anymore but might follow it. We cannot
exclude that more extended RRL emission is either too faint or
resolved out. The CS emission in the channels 40 to 80 km s−1
seems to be perfectly outlined by the NA edge between IRS 1W
and 10W. From channel 20 to 120 km s−1, or 40 to 80 km s−1 for

the weaker lines, the triop emission appears, moving from the
southwest to the northeast and peaking at 60 km s−1, as well as
a larger clump 15(cid:48)(cid:48) north of Sgr A*, peaking at 80 km s−1. Both
features are also bright in SiO emission. Furthermore, a clump
southwest of the Bar, south of triop, and apparently within the
CND is visible in the 80 to 100 km s−1 channels.

3.5.2. High velocities
Outside these CND typical velocities, i.e. -100 to 100 km s−1 in
the CND regions between the lobes, we ﬁnd some high veloc-
ity clumps within 10(cid:48)(cid:48) around the SMBH: The two SiO clumps
YZ11 and YZ1-2 mentioned before can be seen from 80 to 200
km s−1 and 100 to 180 km s−1, respectively, and peak at ∼ 140
to 160 km s−1. This is consistent with the results of Yusef-Zadeh
et al. (2013). In addition, we ﬁnd three CS emitting clumps: one
extending from IRS 9/the Tip past IRS 21 to the eastern edge of
the minicavity in the range of 80 to 200 km s−1, another one 5(cid:48)(cid:48)
north of IRS 6W in the range of 120 to 180 km s−1, and the last
one co-spatial with faint SiO emission 5(cid:48)(cid:48) northeast of YZ1-2 in
the range of 100 to 180 km s−1. In the channels above 100 km
s−1 the H36β line emission is faint and only visible in the form
of tiny clumps. Moreover, the noise increases in these channels
of the H36β image cube. However, the RRL emission appears
in the Tip at velocities above 100 km s−1, which is in agreement
with other ionized emission studies (e.g. Ne ii cube of Irons et al.
2012). There it partially spatially overlaps with the CS emission
at the channels 120 and 140 km s−1.

4. Discussion

In this section, we ﬁrst address the spectral index of the (sub-)
mm continuum emission in the inner 40(cid:48)(cid:48) and the electron tem-
perature of the ionized gas. This is followed by a study of the
relation between the gas and the stars. The last part of this sec-
tion deals with the trends in the molecular line ratios with respect
to their location in the Galactic Center and their possible expla-
nations.

4.1. Continuum spectral index

We computed spectral index maps (see Fig. 8) between 100, 250,
and 340 GHz deﬁned by a power law with S ν ∝ να, where α is
the spectral index. For this we clipped the tapered (same reso-
lution) continuum maps at 5σ before primary beam correction.
A map of the uncertainties based on the SNR and the ﬂux cali-
bration uncertainties is given in the Appendix in Fig. A.8. In the
high SNR regions ∆α is dominated by the ﬂux calibration errors
(see Sect. 2.2). We ﬁnd Sgr A* to have an inverted spectrum in
the 100 to 250 GHz range with α100−250 ∼ 0.58 ± 0.21, which is
related to the synchrotron emission from the accretion disk. The
spectral index is in agreement with α100−230 ∼ 0.5 obtained by
Kunneriath et al. (2012a,b) and with the results of Falcke et al.
(1998), i.e. α100−150 ∼ 0.76 and α43−100 ∼ 0.52 in the 3 - 2 mm
and 7 - 3 mm range, respectively.

The spectral index of Sgr A* is reliable because of its
high signal-to-noise detection and its nature as a point source
but it may be aﬀected by ﬂux density variability (Kunneriath
et al. 2012a). However, the overall spectral trend in this fre-
quency domain remains preserved. In contrast to the minispi-
ral, Sgr A* is detected with a high SNR at 340 GHz and dis-
plays a ﬂat α250−340 = 0.17 ± 0.45. This matches very well the
α230−690 ∼ −0.13 obtained by Marrone et al. (2006b) and the
α217−355 = −0.06 ± 0.26 by Bower et al. (2015). The latter sug-
gests the emission at these frequencies to be in a transition be-
tween the optically thick and thin regime. From 345 GHz and
690 GHz SMA measurements, there is evidence that the over-
all spectrum of Sgr A* peaks around 345 GHz (Marrone et al.
2006b,a; Marrone 2006). This is also in agreement with (Eckart
et al. 2012) who ﬁnd for the bulk of their synchrotron and SSC

models, synchrotron turnover frequencies in the range 300 - 400
GHz.

The spectral indices in the minispiral between 100 and 250
GHz are rather lower limits due to the ﬂux at larger angu-
lar scales being resolved out in the 250 GHz observations, but
measured in the 100 GHz observations. Within a region of 10”

A&A proofs: manuscript no. LMoser_GC-ALMA

around Sgr A* the spectral indices in the minispiral are nega-
tive, similar to the results of Kunneriath et al. (2012b). Towards
IRS 13, 2L, 6, 1W, and 10W, α100−250 reaches values of ∼ -0.1,
indicative of free-free thermal bremsstrahlung emission. These
values might be largely unaﬀected by resolution and beam ﬁll-
ing factor eﬀects because of the brightness and compactness of
these sources, consequently dominating the emission from these
regions. The ﬁlaments south and west of Sgr A* in the Bar and
the ﬁlaments in the the Tip are fainter compared to the diﬀuser
emission gas they are embedded in. Missing the extended 250
GHz ﬂux could be the reason why the spectral index value drops
to ∼ -0.4 and even less, i.e. ∼ -0.7 in the Tip. The spectral index
map of Kunneriath et al. (2012b) shows similarly steep values to-
wards the compact sources, but their results suﬀer from the lower
angular resolution of the CARMA observation. The reliability of
the spectral index for faint extended emission depends heavily on
the uv-coverage which is superior for ALMA. At ALMA reso-
lutions, the spectral index of point source is solely dominated by
the corresponding point source ﬂuxes. Positive spectral indices
prevail in the region south of IRS 5 (at ∆δ ∼ 7(cid:48)(cid:48) from Sgr A*) and
in the IRS 1 to IRS 16NW region of the NA with α100−250 (cid:38) 0 ,
in the Ribbon of the EA with α100−250 (cid:38) 0.1, and in a few single
clouds in the ﬁeld with α100−250 (cid:38) 0.5. These indices imply a
growing importance of dust for the continuum emission at fre-
quencies (cid:38) 230 GHz (see discussion in Kunneriath et al. 2012a).
This trend continues to the next higher band at 340 GHz,
where an α250−340 (cid:38) 0 between 250 and 340 GHz is even found
downstream the NA towards the south of IRS 1W. The Bar and
the Tip show a steep α250−340 ∼ −1 − 0. The 340 GHz data is not
only inﬂuenced by resolution eﬀects but also by a lower SNR
in this region. Only in the brightest sources an α250−340 ∼ −0.3
is found. It is very likely that diﬀuse emission, though within
the angular scales of the 340 GHz observation, is too faint to
be detected at this noise level, which results in even extremer
apparent spectral indices than for the 100 - 250 GHz range.

4.2. Electron temperature

(cid:82)

textbfThe electron temperature can be used as a tool to investi-
gate the strength and location of the ionization in the central re-
gion. This allows us then to speculate on the cause for the ioniza-
tion. Under the assumption of optically thin RRL and continuum
emission and LTE conditions for the ionized gas, we use the for-
mula given in Zhao et al. (2010) to derive the LTE electron tem-
perature from the H39α and the continuum emission. For this we
clipped the tapered (same resolution) continuum map and RRL
cube at 3σ and 3σ, respectively, before primary beam correction.
Since the line width in our data cannot be properly measured due
to the low velocity resolution, we replaced S L∆VFWHM with the
S LdV. Moreover, we adjusted the correction
integrated ﬂux
factor for the power-law approximation to the value for 100 GHz,
i.e. α(ν = 100 GHz, Te ∼ 104 K)∼ 0.904 (Mezger & Henderson
1967). In Figure 9 we show, that the LTE electron temperature
is relatively uniform over the whole minispiral with ∼ 6000 K.
In the NA and the central part of the Bar it approaches 7000 K,
around IRS 1W and 10W 9000 K, and drops in the western Bar,
the EA, and the WA to 5000 K. Extreme values at the edges of
the minispiral are non-physical, i.e. SNR related, and can be ne-
glected. In general, the temperature range of 6000 ± 1000 K is in
agreement with the results of H76α, H92α, H30α observations
by Schwarz et al. (1989), Roberts & Goss (1993), Roberts et al.
(1996), and Zhao et al. (2010) reporting temperatures of ∼ 7000
K, especially in the arms. The rise in Te in the IRS 1W to 10W

region in our data might result from an improper H39α ﬂux de-
tection due to the wide channels as mentioned in Section 3.2.
Deriving Te from the H51β line (Fig. 9), the better detected one
of the two band 3 Hβ lines, by scaling its ﬂux to the Hα emission
using the LTE Hα/Hβ ratio of 3.55 (e.g. Gordon & Walmsley
1990) yields ∼ 6000 K for this region and looks very similar to
the Hα based LTE Te in all other regions in the minispiral.

Lydia Moser et al.: Molecular gas in the vicinity of Sgr A* seen with ALMA

However, towards the center of the Bar, i.e. the region be-
tween IRS 21, 16, and 33, Zhao et al. (2010) ﬁnd temperatures
well above 10000 K. There could be an indication for this be-
haviour in the H51β based temperature map, but the high tem-
perature region does not reach up the NA as far as in the obser-
vations of Zhao et al. (2010). Based on the Te (H51β) distribu-
tion, we attribute the higher temperatures to a low SNR eﬀect - a
similar behaviour can also be seen towards the edges of the min-
ispiral. In contrast to the H51β data, our H39α data is sensitive
enough to reliably detect the very broad (in velocity) but faint
ionized gas component close to and in the minicavity (see also
spectra/line cube in Roberts et al. 1996; Zhao et al. 2010; Irons
et al. 2012) resulting in an electron temperature of 6500 ± 500
K throughout this region, which is consistent with the ∼ 6850 K
found by Roberts et al. (1996).

Due to the moderate signiﬁcance of our RRL line cubes
(spectral resolution), we can only reason that our data reproduces
the electron temperature well for regions with single velocity
components, i.e. the arms, but deviates from former results in
the crowded regions, where the minispiral arms as well as po-
tentially up to now unidentiﬁed/unassigned velocity components
overlap in projection.

4.3. Stellar sources

In order to investigate the relation between molecular and ion-
ized gas as well as to the stars, we compare the line centroids
of these features (see Table 3). We ﬁnd that even for a gener-
ous velocity oﬀset of 70 km s−1 between two features, the list
of matches is still not long. The LOS velocity of the RRL emis-
sion of the ionized gas agrees within the oﬀset range with the
stellar velocities for the IRS 1W, 1E, 7, 9SW, 9SE, 10W, 13W,
13E2, 16NE, 33N, 34E, 34NW, W11b, and W13b (see Figs. 1
and A.11). It suggests that the stellar motion might be related to
the gas motion, but one has to keep in mind that the stellar IR
spectra might have been blended by the bright ionized gas emis-
sion in some cases, which then dominate the resulting spectrum.
In contrast to the RRL emission, the motion of the CS traced
molecular gas agrees with stellar velocities only in the case of
IRS 3E and W13b. Hence, an origin of the molecular gas in the
stellar atmospheres appears unlikely, despite the large amount of
O/B and Wolf-Rayet stars. However, the interaction of the winds
from all the stars in the cluster might have dispersed the hint for
a common velocity and origin.
As already indicated in Section 3.5, the molecular and ionized
gas have common velocities in the NA/Bar region of the min-
ispiral, i.e. in IRS 5, 6E, 16SSW, 16CC, 16SE2, 33SW, 33NW,
33N, W13b, W10b, W7b, and W14b from our selection. We re-
visit this coincidence in more detail in Section 5.3. In the follow-
ing, we discuss the most famous IRS sources in the light of the
emission lines.

4.3.1. IRS 10
For IRS 10W the radial stellar velocity is at about 0 km s−1. We
ﬁnd emission in the RRL H36β line at 70 km s−1. In the 350 GHz
and 250 GHz continuum, it is a marginally extended source with
respective total ﬂuxes of 8mJy and 13mJy and peak ﬂux bright-
nesses of 4.6 mJy beam−1 and 7.5 mJy beam−1. In the lower
resolution 100 GHz map the continuum emission blends in with
the minispiral ﬂux with a peak brightness of 55 mJy beam−1. IRS
10EE is bright in the masing SiO lines. For IRS 10EE we also
ﬁnd in the H36β emission a bright compact component at 70 km

s−1 within the stream of minispiral NA. There are no other lines
and no continuum emission detected for IRS 10EE.

4.3.2. IRS 12N

The stellar radial velocity of the prominent NIR source IRS 12N
lies at -96 km s−1. In the ALMA data it has no prominent sub-
millimeter line or continuum emission.

4.3.3. IRS 13E
The IR radial velocity of the compact 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter stellar clus-
ter is about -31 km s−1. In the RRL H33β line emission at the
position of IRS 13E we ﬁnd peaks at -190 km s−1 and -80 km
s−1 both about 75 km s−1 broad. In line maps the source is void
of in SiO, CS(5-4) and C2H(3-2) emission. The RRL H36β is
bright between IRS 13E and IRS 2L. It peaks about 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) north
of IRS 2L at -300 km s−1 at the position of a faint NIR L-band
source. We also ﬁnd a component at -160 km s−1 peaking on IRS
13E and a component at -60 km s−1 and -43 km s−1 in the gen-
eral IRS 13E and IRS 13N region. The behaviour in the H39α
RRL is consistent with the ﬁndings for the H36β line except that
the spatial resolution is lower. The 350 GHz and 250 GHz con-
tinua peak on the center of IRS 13E with a peak ﬂux of 24 mJy
beam−1 and 37 mJy beam−1, respectively. In the lower angular
resolution 100 GHz band we ﬁnd a peak brightness of about 130
mJy beam−1.

4.3.4. IRS 13N
IRS 13N is a 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter stellar cluster disjunct from IRS 13E
at a radial velocity of about 20 km s−1. It is rather inconspicuous
in its line emission. There is a detection in the CS(5-4) line at 90
km s−1 which is possibly not associated with the source. In the
H39α emission we ﬁnd possible extensions in line emission at
velocities of 44 km s−1 and from -90 till 170 km s−1. In the H36β
emission the southern edge of the source is bright over a velocity
range of -43 km s−1 till -60 km s−1. In the 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution 350
GHz map we ﬁnd continuum ﬂux on right on all 13N members
peaking at about 7.5 mJy beam−1 with some a diﬀuse component
about 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to the NW. The 250 GHz data, the cluster has a point
ﬂux density of 18mJy. In the lower resolution 100 GHz map IRS
13N appears only as an extension of the brighter IRS 13E source.

4.3.5. IRS 16NE
The stellar radial velocity of IRS 16NE is 17 km s−1. At its po-
sition we see in RRL the H33β peaking at a velocity of -30 km
s−1 and -80 km s−1 with a width of 100 km s−1. In RRL maps we
see the source as part of minispiral ﬂow. The H36β line emission
peaks 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to the east at -80 km s−1. There is line ﬂux in the
range of -100 km s−1 to +100 km s−1 east of source. We ﬁnd a
similar behaviour for H33β line except that the emission at -80
km s−1 peaks weakly up on source itself. In the velocity range
-40 km s−1 till -12 km s−1 we ﬁnd emission line ﬂux 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) east
of the source. Other than that IRS 16NE is clear of line emission
in all line maps. At 350 GHz and 250 GHz IRS 16NE is a point
source with 3.0 mJy and 3.9 mJy. At 100 GHz the source ﬂux is
smeared out and blends in with the minispiral.

4.3.6. IRS 16SW
IRS 16SW has a radial velocity of 460 km s−1. In the ALMA
spectra towards its position are free of strong emission lines ex-
cept a faint CS(5-4) line at -40 km s−1. The emission line map
shows that at the velocity there is a 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) wide valley between
two CS(5-4) line emitting regions. There is a possible contin-
uum detection at 350 GHz and 250 GHz with ﬂuxes of 0.66mJy
and 1.8mJy, respectively.

4.3.7. IRS 1W
In the NIR IRS 1W is a dust embedded bowshock star at the
lower tip of the minispiral NA close to the location at which
it touches the minispiral bar. It shows spectral line features in
CS(5-4) and RRL at its radial velocity of 20 km s−1. The line
maps show two CS(5-4) emission clumps to northeast and south-
west of the source position. The overall velocity pattern follows
that of the northern arm. The gas has a velocity of 1 km s−1 to 15
km s−1 southeast of the source, then splits to a SE/NW double
component in the 15 km s−1 to 30 km s−1 interval, leaving out the
exact position of IRS 1W, to ﬁnally present itself as a northwest
component in the 30 km s−1 to 43 km s−1 interval. The reason
for this behaviour might be a combination of absorption and ex-
citation.
The continuum 350 GHz and 250 GHz continuum emission
peak on the bright minispiral ridge about 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) to 0.2(cid:48)(cid:48) southwest
of the stellar source position. As the compact source blends into
the minispiral at the lower resolution 100 GHz IRS 1W is bright
with peak emission of 80 mJy beam−1 and more extended ﬂux
density towards the southwest along 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to 1(cid:48)(cid:48).

4.3.8. IRS 21
IRS 21 is a dust enshrouded star located in the minispiral bar.
The ALMA data shows an emission peak on source in the H36β
line at -96 km s−1 which is consistent with the minispiral ﬂow.
There is also line emission to the north and S. The 250 GHz and
350 GHz continuum peaks about 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) to the northwest giving the
appearance of a relatively isolated compact source on the min-
ispiral ridge. with a peak ﬂux density 7.5mJy at 350 GHz and
11mJy at 250 GHz. Due to the lower angular resolution at 100
GHz the source is smeared out and cannot easily be identiﬁed
as a point source within the minispiral. The corresponding re-
gion appears to be brighter to the northwest of the IRS 21 source
position.

4.3.9. IRS 29
IRS 29and IRS 29NE have radial velocities of -93 km s−1 and
-130 km s−1, respectively.: The ALMA spectra towards their po-
sition show CS(5-4) and C2H(3-2) line at 50 km s−1. In fact,
the molecular emission belongs to the clump between IRS 29
and IRS 29NE 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) northeast of IRS 29. This clump is part of
an emission line ridge south of IRS 3. There is a possible weak
continuum detection at 350 GHz with a ﬂux of ≤2mJy. At 250
GHz and 100 GHz no continuum detection can be claimed.

ﬂux from material north of IRS 2L (see IRS 13E) is smeared into
the aperture. At 350 GHz and 250 GHz there is a continuum ﬂux
peak at the position of IRS 2L. with ﬂux densities of 15 mJy and
29 mJy. At 100 GHz we ﬁnd a continuum ﬂux of about 130 mJy
towards IRS 2L (point source of extended?).

4.3.11. IRS 33
There are a few NIR sources to the west and southwest of IRS
16SW to which are listed under IRS 33. Here we consider IRS
33NW, N, SE, and SW. Radial velocities are 70 km s−1 for 33N
and 160 km s−1 for 33E. The spectra towards IRS 33SE reveal no
prominent emission lines. IRS 33SW, N, northwest show CS(5-
4) line emission at -30 km s−1. The maps show that the CS(5-4)
line emission northwest of IRS 33SW lies at the bridge or tips of
emission clumps not associated with source.
At part of the minispiral ﬂow hydrogen RRL emission passes
0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) south of IRS 33N at -330 km s−1. No clear continuum emis-
sion can be attributed to the IRS 33 sources. Extended continuum
ﬂux passes though the cluster probably as part of the minispiral.

4.3.12. IRS 3
This is a dust enshrouded star. VLTI observations in the near-
infrared have shown that it has an extended shell that contains
also a central compact source. Its radial velocity is not known.
Towards the position of the central star the ALMA spectroscopy
data show a CS(5-4) and a C2H(3-2) line at 60 km s−1 as well
as some what less well deﬁned radio recombination lines at 80
km s−1. The line maps reveal that the CS(5-4) and C2H(3-2) line
detections are associated with a bright bar extending about 1(cid:48)(cid:48) to
the north and south with line ﬂux towards IRS 7. The RRL emis-
sion of the H36β line represents itself as a bright bar extending
about 1(cid:48)(cid:48) to southwest with a velocity of about -200 km s−1. In
the continuum, we detect a weak point source with a 350 GHz
ﬂux density of 1.2 mJy. There is also low level extended contin-
uum emission to the south and W. At 250 GHz there is a ridge
of continuum emission with IRS 3 and IRS 7 at the southwest
and northeast tips. The ridge has a peak surface brightness of 1.5
mJy beam−1. with a 1.5 mJy unresolved source at the position of
IRS 3. At 100 GHz the entire continuum structure is speared out.

4.3.13. IRS 5
The RRL radial velocity at IRS 5 is 110 km s−1. It shows no
strong emission line that could be attributed to the source. Line
emission of the northern arm occurs about 1.3" to the west. No
continuum emission can be attributed to the source at 350 GHz,
250 GHz and 100 GHz.

4.3.14. IRS 6
Radial velocities of IRS 6E and IRS 6W are about -120 km s−1,
respectively. The RRL avoid the IRS sources in that region and
ﬁll the gap between them as a ﬁlament (K13, K17, K19 Zhao
et al. 2009).

4.3.10. IRS 2L
The stellar radial velocity of IRS 2L is about -270 km s−1. The
spectrum towards the source shows a H36β line peak at -280 km
s−1. The source is in a void of molecular emission. There is no
clear line identiﬁcation right at the position of IRS 2L. RRL line

4.3.15. IRS 7
At a radial velocity of about -120 km s−1 IRS 7 shows spatially
unresolved maser emission lines at SiO(6-5), a bit stronger at
SiO(8-7). The CS(5-4) line peaks at -50 km s−1 and +50 km s−1.
C2H(3-2) shows a behaviour quite similar to CS(5-4). Maps of

the CS(5-4) line show that the source is part of a NS ridge that
peaks in molecular line emission about 0.5" SSE of the source.
The C2H(3-2) line emission is unresolved with an oﬀset if about
0.2(cid:48)(cid:48) to the S.

In the 350 GHz and 250 GHz continuum we have a point
source right at the source postion with ﬂux densities of about
1mJy and 2.5mJy, respectively. In the 100 GHz continuum we
ﬁnd a 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to 2(cid:48)(cid:48) long tail to the north. This extended component
peaks at 0.65" north of the stellar position. At the position of
IRS 7 we ﬁnd a surface brightness of 1 mJy beam−1 and a peak
brightness on the tain of about 1.6 mJy beam−1,

4.3.16. IRS 9
The stellar radial velocity for IRS 9 is -340 km s−1. Towards
its position there is weak CS(5-4) line emission at 0 km s−1.
Otherwise there is no conspicuous line emission to be detected
neither on IRS 9 nor on the NIR source 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) to the north. On IRS
9 itself there is no continuum detection above 1mJy at 100 GHz
to 350 GHz. There is a faint 2.1mJy emission peak in continuum
0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) north of IRS 9.

4.4. The molecular line ratios

Molecular line ratios allow to probe the molecular excitation and
abundance. In Table E.1 we list the molecular line ratios for dif-
ferent molecules for all regions identiﬁed in Sect. 2.4 (details on
computation therein). As an overview we roughly summarize the
ratios by regions with similar ratios in Table 4 and sorted them
by the general trend of the CS ratios.

We ﬁnd that all CS/X (X: any other observed molecule) ra-
tios are signiﬁcantly elevated in the center and the SEW clump,
i.e. more than 3 times higher than in the triop and single clumps
further out of the center which are rather related to the CND.
A similar behaviour can be seen in the CS(7-6)/HCN(4-3) in-
tensity ratio map of Montero-Castaño et al. (2009): Around Sgr
A* the intensity ratio, and with it the luminosity ratio due to the
similar frequencies, is about 10 times higher than in the CND.
The C2H/X and SO/X listed in Table 4 appear to be marginally
enhanced by a factor of 1.5 in the center and the SEW clump.
In ratios with C2H, the C2H ﬂux might be overestimated in
the channels -20 and 0 km s−1 because of strong sidelobe arte-
facts. Furthermore, the deviation of the integrated ﬂux ratios
from the channel ﬂux ratios is here about a factor of 2 since the
integrated emission contains both C2H ﬁnestructure lines. The
SiO(6–5)/H13CO+ ratio seems to remain constant, slightly de-
creasing towards the center.

The reason for the above described behaviour of the line ra-
tios can be manifold: The Galactic Center is a region of extreme
conditions in terms of intense IR to UV radiation from the nu-
clear cluster of massive stars and the X-ray emission from a pop-
ulation of stellar remnants and the SMBH (e.g. Serabyn & Lacy
1985; Krabbe et al. 1991; Baganoﬀ et al. 2003; Perez et al. 2015;
Mori et al. 2015). Furthermore, the molecular emission, maybe
itself an infalling CND clump, is located in a turbulent region,
where the three minispiral gas streamers meet and where stellar
winds and gravitational shear impact the environment. Conse-
quently, shocks and magnetic ﬁelds may also play an important
role.

In a scenario where the molecular gas is very close to the cen-
ter, one can assume the winds from the stellar cluster to sweep
away a large amount of the gas so that only the densest cores and
a diﬀuse intercloud medium is left over. This will aﬀect the den-

sities, temperatures and the overall chemistry in a complicated
way.

4.4.1. Excitation

In the following we speculate on how the molecular line ratios
and in particular the molecular excitation is linked to variations
of the physical properties in the central region.
From the emission lines in band 6, H13CO+ is the easiest to
excite with an upper state energy of Eu/kB ∼ 25 K and a critical
density of nc ∼ 3 × 106 cm−3. Though having the same Eu/kB,
C2H needs a density twice as high as for H13CO+ to thermal-
ize. CS, the molecule with the strongest emission in the center,
requires a slightly lower density but has an upper state tempera-
ture of 35 K. The transitions of SO and SiO correspond to ener-
gies of ∼ 45 K, where the ﬁrst thermalizes at densities similar to
the one of H13CO+ but the latter has one of the highest critical
densities in band 6, i.e. 8 × 106 cm−3. The next group of higher
upper state energies comprise CH3OH (around 70 and 80 K and
densities of 0.6 - 1 × 106 cm−3) and SiO (at 75 K with the high-
est critical density of the sample, i.e. 2 × 107 cm−3). Such high
excitation conditions obviously occur only in few regions. The
molecule with the highest upper state energy and found in the
same regions as the former is HC3N with an energy of 165 K.
Because of the similar critical densities of about 5 × 106
cm−3 the excitation might be rather determined by the temper-
ature for CS, C2H, and H13CO+ which are tracing the overall
emission. Indeed, non-LTE radiation transfer models of H+
3 and
CO in the cloud towards IRS 3 suggest a temperature and den-
sity of Tk = (300 ± 50) K and nH2 ≥ 104 cm−3 (Goto et al. 2014)
consistent with the estimate for a small ﬁlling factor ensemble
of irradiated dense clumps/clouds of Goicoechea et al. (2013).
Minispiral dust temperatures of Td = 150 - 300 K obtained from
MIR/FIR dust observations (Gezari et al. 1985; Cotera et al.
1999; Lau et al. 2013) give a lower limit for the kinetic temper-
ature of the gas there. Compared to this, recent estimate ranges
for CND clumps, especially in the SW lobe, are Tk ∼ 100 - 500
K, nH2 ∼ 104.5 - 106.5 cm−3 and Td = 50 - 90 K (Mills et al. 2013;
Requena-Torres et al. 2012; Lau et al. 2013).

CS can be abundant enough to be aﬀected by radiative trap-
ping so that it appears thermalized at far lower densities, i.e a
factor of 25 less than the critical density (Shirley 2015). Consid-
ering abundance ratios found in the GC of SiO/H13CO+ ∼ 2-3
and CS/H13CO+ ∼ 25-70 (Amo-Baladrón et al. 2011) H13CO+
is expected to be faint. SiO and SO might trace the denser cloud
interior, but not only due to excitation as we will discuss later in
this section.

Another eﬀect that can skew the level population distribu-
tion of molecules is IR pumping, i.e. the excitation of the lowest
vibrational states and a consequent decay to higher purely ro-
tational levels than expected for a given collisional excitation
rate. Carroll & Goldsmith (1981) found the CS molecule to be
the most eﬃciently pumped species of the ones tested in their
study, followed by SiO, and, somewhat less eﬀectively, HCN.
They obtain a minimum dust temperature needed to turn on the
CS IR pumping of T ≥ 114 K which results in a maximum dis-
tance from a dust embedded star (L ∼ 105L(cid:12)) at which pumping
still occurs of r (cid:46) 0.04 pc = 1(cid:48)(cid:48). The environment of Sgr A*
comprises several dust embedded stars. In fact, the CS emission
covers regions at and around IRS 1W, 3, 6, 7, 21, 29, which are
known as dust embedded sources with temperatures of T > 200
K (Gezari et al. 1985; Tanner et al. 2002, 2005; Moultaka et al.
2004; Viehmann et al. 2006; Pott et al. 2008a,b).

In addition, the 19µm/37µm colour temperature map from
Lau et al. (2013) shows dust temperatures of T = 120 − 150 K
within r ∼ 5(cid:48)(cid:48) of the minispiral and T = 105−135 K in the region
between IRS 3 and 7. In the case that the CS is indeed engulﬁng
the minispiral and the stars, the impact of IR pumping by hot
dust on the CS line ﬂux can not be neglected.

Vibrationally excited HCN has already been detected in the
dense, shielded region in the SW lobe (Mills et al. 2013), where a
possible stellar heating origin is not discernible in the NIR HST-
NICMOS images - most likely due to the high extinction. Since
the conditions in this clump are suﬃcient to excite the vibra-
tional transition of HCN, the conditions in the center should be
ideal. In fact, Goto et al. (2014) had diﬃculties to reproduce the
CO excitation ladder observed towards IRS 1W and IRS 3 by
radiative transfer modelling and suspect the IR pumping to af-
fect the level population. Observations of vibrationally excited
molecules (CS, HCN, SiO) in these regions could clarify the im-
pact of this eﬀect.

4.4.2. Abundance

CS has been found to be the most abundant S-bearing molecule
in edges of PDRs and diﬀuse ISM (PDR shell tracer, e.g. Lucas
& Liszt 2002; Goicoechea et al. 2006) because of the high abun-
dance of ionized sulphur in the gas phase (e.g. Lepp et al. 1988).
However, in dense clouds sulphur is locked up in the progeni-
tor molecules depleted onto grains (Charnley 1997; van der Tak
et al. 2003) and therefore the CS abundance is low (e.g. Bergin
et al. 2001; Di Francesco et al. 2002). Chemical modelling by
Benz et al. (2007) suggest that the presence of X-ray emission

enhances the gas phase abundances of CS and SO. However, nei-
ther SO appears to be signiﬁcantly elevated in the center, nor
SiO for the assumption of IR pumping conditions. Either X-rays
and/or IR pumping do not play an important role, or another
eﬀect depletes these molecules relative to CS. Considering the
photodissociation rates, it becomes evident that SiO and SO are
quite sensitive to UV-radiation, only outmatched by HC3N. On
the other end of the ladder, H13CO+ is the most UV-resistant
species, followed by C2H and CS at a separation of < 2 mag-
nitudes. CH3OH lies in between the two extremes. Therefore,
ﬁnding the emission of the UV-sensitive species rather localized
at the CS peaks might not only relate to excitation eﬀects but
also to the shielding properties of the gas. CS, SO, SiO, CH3OH
are related to grains: The CH3OH and the progenitor molecules
of CS ans SO are formed on grains which often contain silicates
(i.e. SiO). These molecules or their progenitors can be released
to the gas phase at a molecule speciﬁc temperature (evapora-
tion) or by shocks (sputtering). Therefore, while SiO is rather
accepted to be a shock tracer, the other molecules can also in-
dicate a warmer environment enhancing their abundances like it
might be the case for the region west of IRS 3. It shows strong
HC3N and CH3OH emission and moderate H13CO+ emission,
but faint CS emission. The lack of SiO in this obviously UV-
shielded, warm region suggests a temperature-related excitation
and/or abundance enhancement rather than a shock chemistry.

5. Nature of the molecular gas
5.1. Infrared dark clouds and methanol masers
When comparing to the NIR emission in Figure 10, it is evident
that the large N2H+ clouds, i.e. the V-cloud and SEE, correspond
to large dark clouds in the foreground of the center absorbing the
NIR radiation. In fact, this is not unexpected: N2H+ is mainly de-
stroyed by reactions with CO which is depleted on to dust grains
at temperatures of Tk (cid:46) 25 K (Vasyunina et al. 2012) like they
can be found in dark clouds. The absence of relatively strong
emission from other molecules suggests a similar fate for them
as for CO. Therefore, these clumps seem to be much cooler than
the CND. A lower temperature limit is given by the freezeout
of N2 at Tk ∼ 15 K (Vasyunina et al. 2012) prohibiting the for-

mation of N2H+ from it. Nevertheless, the connection between
dark clouds and N2H+ emission is not universal as it can be seen
in - among many more - e.g. the region 10(cid:48)(cid:48) east of Sgr A*,
where there is N2H+, but no NIR absorbing dust cloud, and in
the dark clumps ∼ 30(cid:48)(cid:48) north of Sgr A*, which do not show
N2H+ emission. Obviously, the excitation and abundance evo-
lution are more complicated here. Martín et al. (2012) ﬁnd the
velocity centroids of the V-cloud to be at ∼ 0 km s−1 in the west
and ∼ 60 km s−1 in the east. The velocity centroid of SEE is
stated to be at ∼ 10 km s−1 and the line FWHMs are typically
around ∼ 20 km s−1. This is in agreement with our low spectral
resolution data. The proximity of these two clouds in velocity
and space to the 20 km s−1- and 50 km s−1-GMCs in the south-

Lydia Moser et al.: Molecular gas in the vicinity of Sgr A* seen with ALMA

east and the east of the GC suggests rather a relation to them than
to the CND, where N2H+ is comparably faint.

These dark clouds discussed above as well as the triop,
which actually contains a tiny dark cloud, are also sources of
class I CH3OH maser emission at 36 and 44 GHz (see Sec-
tion 3.3) and of CH3OH(8–7) emission. The latter transition
can also be excited to ampliﬁed stimulated emission (95 GHz
class I maser, (e.g. Voronkov et al. 2012, and references therein).
Indeed, the CH3OH(8–7) emission peaks at three of the four
masers, i.e. the two 44 GHz masers in the eastern edge of the V-
cloud and in the triop, and the 36 GHz maser in SEE, where the
latter two are much fainter compared to the ﬁrst and surrounded
by extended emission. Due to the extremely narrow line widths
of ∼ 1 − 2 km s−1 (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2001; Sjouwerman et al.
2010; Pihlström et al. 2011), the maser nature of CH3OH(8–7)
line emission in these peaks cannot be assessed with our obser-
vations, but the very bright and point source like emission of the
ﬁrst peak strongly implies an ampliﬁcation by a maser process.
Class I methanol masers are believed to be collisionally
pumped and hence tracing shocks, while Class II methanol
masers are pumped by FIR-radiation relating them to star-
forming regions. The 36, 44 and 95 GHz class I masers are
often found together, suggesting the same underlying material
and conditions, where the 95 GHz line emission is intrinsically
fainter (e.g. Fontani et al. 2010; McEwen et al. 2014; Kang et al.
2015). Modelling of the methanol maser transitions results that
the favoured conditions for 36 GHz and 44 GHz maser line emis-
sion overlap with Tk (cid:38) 50 K and n ∼ 105 − 106 cm−1, where
in star-forming regions the 36 GHz masers occurs in less dense
(and cooler gas) than the 44 GHz masers and vice versa for
supernova remnants (SNR; Pratap et al. 2008; McEwen et al.
2014). On the one hand, the eastern edge of the V-cloud and the
SEE region appear not only cold and dense enough to form stars,
but they are also co-spatial with bright SiO emission, that is only
surpassed in the southern lobe, which, among others, could im-
ply an interaction of the SNR Sgr A East with the 20 km s−1
and 50 km s−1 - GMCs producing large-scale shocks. (Sato &
Tsuboi 2008; Martín et al. 2012; Moser et al. 2014, 2016). On
the other hand, shocks from outﬂows from YSOs are also able
to excite the maser. In fact, the 44 GHz maser in the triop and
at the prominent CH3OH(8–7) peak in the V-cloud as well as
the 36 GHz maser in SEE are located next (r < 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) to a star
or weak NIR sources in projection. Consequently, more obser-
vations are needed to understand and disentangle the conditions
and their causes in these mixed regions better.

5.2. High velocity clouds
Here we consider clouds as high velocity clouds that move faster
than the typical ranges for molecular gas in the CND, i.e. -100
to 100 km s−1.
Based on SiO(5–4) emission, Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2013) mea-
sure a line center and width of v ∼ 148 km s−1 and FWHM ∼ 47
km s−1 for clump YZ1-2, and v ∼ 136 km s−1 and FWHM ∼ 56
km s−1 for clump YZ1. They interpret these properties and their
line transition modelling results of nH2 ∼ 105 − 106 cm−3 and
Tk ∼ 100− 200 K as indication for highly embedded protostellar
outﬂows.
In contrast to the earlier data, the SiO clumps YZ1-2 and
YZ11 are partly resolved in this observation showing an elon-
gated structure pointing at each other (see Fig. 6). On the one
hand, the conﬁguration is reminiscent of a double lobed outﬂow
from a hypothetical source in the middle of the two SiO clumps.
But such a conﬁguration can be ruled out due to the similar ve-

et al. (2012): ionized emission at the high velocity SiO cloud YZ1-2
southwest of IRS 1W (arbitrary units).

locities. Instead, it could be indeed possible that we are seeing
the single-sided lobes from two independent outﬂow sources as
suggested by Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2013).

On the other hand, especially YZ1-2 looks like a boundary
due to its elongated/ﬁlamentary shape closely following the NA
streamer. In fact, it is located in the region where the Bridge, i.e.
the minispiral component between the NA and the EA, overlaps
with the NA and their proper motions are opposite to each other:
The NA has an x- and y-velocity components of vx ∼ -188 km
s−1 and vy ∼ -560 km s−1 and the Bridge shows vα ∼ 32 km
s−1 and vδ ∼ 360 km s−1 (clumps X13 and K37, respectively,
in Zhao et al. 2009). In addition, the Bridge covers radial ve-
locities of ∼ 40 - 140 km s−1 and shows a velocity component
at 130 km s−1 at the discussed position, whereas the NA moves
with ∼ 20 km s−1 in this region (Fig. 11). The main ﬁlament
in the Bridge, apparently connecting the Tip with the IRS 1W
region and containing the K37 (Zhao et al. 2009) component,
is about as thick as the YZ1-2 is long. While a heads-on colli-
sion of the NA streamer and the Bridge ﬁlament would surely
destroy the dust grains and molecules at such high velocities,
scraping past each other could generate shock velocities in the
layers further inwards of the clouds that would be ideal for grain
sputtering and the release or production of gas-phase SiO. Even
if this streamer collision scenario might not be the direct reason
for the SiO emission, it could be an indirect one by initiating the
formation of YSOs in the compressed gas region.

Apart from the known SiO clumps YZ1-2 and YZ11, we dis-
cover 3 more clumps in CS emission at similar velocities. One
of them seems to be associated with YZ1-2, showing faint CS
emission at the location of the SiO peak and slightly brighter CS
emission 5(cid:48)(cid:48) northeast of it, co-spatial with faint SiO emission
in the same channels. This extension of YZ1-2 to the northeast
parallel to the elongation of YZ1-2 can also be seen in the SiO
data of Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2013). The other two CS clumps,
one between the Tip and the minicavity, the other north of the

IRS 6 region in the western Bar, are elongated and in line with
each other. The ﬁrst one overlaps in space and velocity with the
ionized gas emission, while the second appears as unassociated
as the YZ11 cloud, where no other emission is detected in the
corresponding channels. The occurrence of several clumps with
similar velocities and FWHM within a radius of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) suggests a
relation between them - maybe even including the SiO clumps.
They could be the denser left-overs of a tidally disrupted cloud
that is falling towards the center similar to what has been pro-
posed for the high negative velocity cloud around -180 km s−1
detected in e.g. OH absorption and NH3 emission (Zhao et al.
1995; Karlsson et al. 2003; Donovan et al. 2006). In contrast
to the latter, large scale emission of the 150 km s−1 clumps has
not been detected in previous observations (Wright et al. 2001;
Martín et al. 2012) except from a tentative feature in the channel
maps of Christopher et al. (2005).

Karlsson et al. (2015): Black contours show the 100 GHz continuum,

tour units). Note: shape of streamer head resembles distribution of CS
clumps.

5.3. Origin of the molecular gas in the central 20 arcseconds
The presence of molecular gas in the central parsec has been
indicated by several observations in the past.

Molecular gas is expected to be dissociated into ionized el-
ements if the conditions are as harsh as the are found in the
very center close to the super massive black hole SgrA* and
well within the cluster of young and hot He-stars. However, the
presence of molecular gas or even ice in the central parsec has
been indicated by several observations in the past. The reason for
this lies in the crossing timescale of freshly infalling or orbiting
gas streams through the central stellar cluster. This time scale is
short compared to the dissociation time scale in the presence of
shielding and the cloud clump evaporation timescale (discussion
in Moultaka et al. 2004, 2005, 2015a,b).

Article number, page 22 of 58

Geballe et al. (1989) discovered strong CO absorption to-
wards IRS 3 and 7 and even water and CO ice absorption is de-
tected in the minispiral and towards the mass losing stars (Moul-
taka et al. 2004, 2005, 2015a,b). Furthermore, the presence of
molecular gas at and around Sgr A* is evident in the HCN(4–
3) and CS(7–6) maps of Montero-Castaño et al. (2009) and the
CN map of Martín et al. (2012). From the up to now largest line
study of the cavity, comprising CO transition lines from J=4–3
to J=24–23 , Goicoechea et al. (2013) inferred that the ISM can
be described either by a single, hot (Tk > 1000 K), low-density
(nH2 ≤ 104 cm−3) component or by multiple rather compact com-
ponents at a lower temperature and a higher density. The ALMA
data discussed here supports the latter case.

Recent NIR and MIR data on the distribution of H2O ice,
hydrocarbons, CO ice and gaseous CO reveal that molecular
gas and ices are ubiquitous in the whole central minispiral and
around IRS 3, 7, and 29 (Moultaka et al. 2015a,b). The H2O ice
absorption extends over the whole minispiral, whereas the hy-
drocarbons and gaseous CO absorption are rather restricted to
the dust ﬁlaments and the stars in the case of CO, but the op-
tical depth of all three species is large around IRS 3, 7, 29 and
the western part of the Bar. Solid CO, which requires even lower
temperatures (T < 25 K, Vasyunina et al. 2012) than H2O ice to
exist, shows strong absorption only in the dust ﬁlaments between
IRS 1W and the minicavity, IRS 21 and in the IRS 2L region, and
faint absorption towards IRS 3, 7, and 29.

The strong absorption features of molecular gas and ice to-
wards IRS 3, 7, and 29 and the western Bar are accompanied by
strong IR absorption features of dust grains: Pott et al. (2008b,a)
detected silicate absorption in the spectra of IRS 3 and IRS 7
and they point out that the dust is of interstellar nature and is not
related to the circumstellar regions of IRS 3 and IRS 7. In fact,
there is a silicate dust veil extending between IRS 7 over IRS 3
and IRS 29 across the western part of the Bar (Viehmann et al.
2006). This dust could be a likely reservoir for SiO molecules
in the gas phase when released to it via shocks or evaporation,
UV, X-rays. The CS emission at positive velocities covers the IR
absorption regions at IRS 3, 7, and 29, and partly the western
Bar. Although being strongly mass-losing stars, the shifts in the
peaks of the distributions of gas and ice and the location of IRS 3
and IRS 7 suggest the IRS sources to play a marginal role in the
enrichment of the gas phase molecules. Only IRS 29 coincides
with a CS peak. A relation with the silicate dust appears more
likely, but needs to be probed. The blueshifted CS emission is
more puzzling: It coincides with the CO gas and ice absorption
in the dusty region between IRS 1W, IRS 21, and the minicavity,
but not in the IRS 2L region. On the one hand, the coincidence
of the molecular gas emission with the RRL in projection and
velocity, i.e. -40 to 0 km s−1, might indicate a common molec-
ular cloud with a limited ionized surface or an interaction of a
molecular gas streamer, not yet ionized, with the NA. On the
other hand, the ambiguous behaviour of CS emission compared
to the IR ice and gas absorptions suggests that the features are
rather not related.

From the spectroscopic view, Goto et al. (2014) reported
strong absorption in the higher excitation lines of H+
3 and CO
in the NIR towards IRS 3 around 50 and 60 km s−1, respectively
and weaker absorption around 45 km s−1. In contrasts to this, the
spectrum of IRS 1W shows only the 45 km s−1 component. Sim-
ilar results of 50 km s−1 were found by Geballe et al. (1989), but
at a much lower spectroscopic and spatial resolution. In their ob-
served spectra, it becomes evident, that the IRS 1 region covers
a range of 0 - 40 km s−1, whereas the broad absorption between
0 and 60 km s−1 is not only seen in IRS 3, but also towards the

Lydia Moser et al.: Molecular gas in the vicinity of Sgr A* seen with ALMA

IRS 6 region and IRS 7. This behaviour is recognizable in the
CS emission channel maps (Fig. 7). Martín et al. (2012) report a
velocity component at 46 km s−1 for clump 18, which covers the
bulk of the positive velocity CS clumps between IRS 3, 7 and
Sgr A* and whose peak is almost co-spatial with IRS 7. Further-
more, they determined a second component at -77 km s−1 which
is most likely the same component detected in absorption at -72
km s−1 in the lower excitation CO emission IRS 1, IRS 3, and
IRS 16NE (Goto et al. 2014). This is consistent with the ALMA
data showing emission at or nearby these sources in the -80 to
-40 km s−1 channels.

The H+

3 and CO absorption and the sub-mm molecular emis-
sion originate from the same cloud which is likely located in
front of or around IRS 3 and 7. Moreover, the silicate dust ab-
sorption could take place in the same cloud. Its line of sight
(LOS) position with respect to the minisprial remains unclear,
since the LOS position of IRS 3 and 7 relative to minispiral is
not clear. In the likely case that the molecular material is not a
product of mass ejection from the evolved stars in the nuclear
cluster, this clump might be linked to the CND. In fact, the ve-
locity range matches the CND velocities in the triop region and
Goto et al. (2014) considered the clump to be an extension of the
CND.

Another intriguing aspect is given by Karlsson et al. (2003,
2015): They detect an additional streamer in OH absorption that
has not been noticed in other molecular lines so far. The absorp-
tion feature is visible from -30 to 70 km s−1 and extends from
the center, where it peaks northwest from Sgr A* at 50 km s−1
("head"), to the SW lobe and beyond, where it peaks at ∼ 70 km
s−1 ("tail"). One can ﬁnd faint hints of it in the CS(1–0) channel
maps of Liu et al. (2012) and the denser parts are also detected as
single clumps in, e.g., CN (Karlsson et al. 2015). We see that the
ALMA CS emission extends slightly across the western Bar in
the same direction like the streamer (Fig. 12). Between velocities
of -30 to 15 km s−1 the OH absorption of the head is centered on
Sgr A*. The same is visible for the CS emission. The OH and CS
detected gas also shows an apparent connection to the southeast
around velocities of 0 km s−1. The OH-streamer seems to be a
viable explanation at least for the redshifted emission in the cen-
ter: The observed OH-transition (1665, 1667 MHz) traces rather
diﬀuse material, so that the tidally stretched tail is only tenta-
tively detected by the high density tracers (e.g. HCN, HCO+,
CS) towards higher density clumps within it which then appear
to be unrelated at ﬁrst sight. The density of the head of the OH-
streamer seems to be higher than that of the tail gas. Either the
head is the dense core of the initial cloud, or the gas is com-
pressed by the stellar winds and the other gas streamers, or, most
likely, it is a mixture of both. Several CS emission peaks within
the region between IRS 3, IRS 7 and Sgr A* are co-spatial with
SiO emission peaks, that could indicate shocks, though a signiﬁ-
cant impact of the X-ray and UV radiation ﬁeld in the gas phase
SiO cannot be ruled out.

The blueshifted molecular gas in the center could be part of
the OH-streamer orbit. Such a case raises several questions on
the trajectory of the clump, the eccentricity and the periapse dis-
tance of the orbit, and intimately related to this, the excitation
and the lack of ionization. Furthermore, the streamer could inter-
act with the NA and be entrained by it towards the center. This
would explain the coincidence in projected location and velocity
on the one hand. On the other hand, no blueshifted SiO emission
is detected in the NA except from the SiO maser stars, but this
could be due to an insuﬃcient SNR. The integrated CS emission
in the blueshifted peaks in the center is only half as bright as in
the redshifted peaks. If the SiO emission scales accordingly, it

might be too weak to be detected in this observation. In a case
where the OH-streamer is interacting with, but not entrained by
the NA, the gas might be slowed down enough to form a disk
feeding the central 10(cid:48)(cid:48) (0.4 pc) and might be even related to the
counterclockwise disk (Paumard et al. 2006; Bartko et al. 2009,
2010; Lu et al. 2009).

In order to understand the dynamical processes and the re-
lations between the sources in the center, proper motions are
mandatory to complete the picture. Based on few data sets within
a total time range of ∼ 15 yr, Zhao et al. (2009, 2010) established
a plausible 3D model of the minispiral streamers as Keplerian or-
bits around Sgr A*. A similar campaign needs to be conducted
for the molecular gas in the CND and the cavity.

6. Summary
The interferometer ALMA was used to observe Sgr A* and its
environment at 100, 250, and 340 GHz with a spatial resolution
of 0.5 - 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and a spectral resolution of 15-50 km s−1. We found,
in addition to the continuum in the three bands, 11 molecular line
transitions and 5 RRL transitions as well as many interesting
regions and features. The main results are summarized in the
following:

Continuum and RRL emission: The minspiral is well de-
tected in its whole extent in the 100 GHz continuum and the
H39α emission yielding an almost uniform electron tempera-
ture around Te ∼ 6000 K. The 250 and 350 GHz continuum
emission trace the minispiral ﬁlaments and IRS sources at an up
to now unprecedented resolution (< 0.75(cid:48)(cid:48)) in the sub-mm do-
main. The spectral index of Sgr A* is ∼ 0.5 at 100 - 250 GHz
and ∼ 0.0 at 230 - 340 GHz. The compact and high SNR re-
gions in the center show spectral indices around -0.1 implying
Bremsstrahlung emission, while indications for dust emission
gaining importance for the continuum emission is seen in the
NA and EA in the form of a positive spectral index.

Molecular line emission: The most striking result from this
data is the for the ﬁrst time resolved view on sub-mm molecular
line emission of the inner 20(cid:48)(cid:48). It shows a clumpy distribution in
CS line emission with the bulk of the emission at positive ve-
locities and in a region conﬁned by the minispiral NA, Bar and
the sources IRS 3 and 7. Though partly spatially overlapping
with the RRL emission at the same negative velocities, the rela-
tion to the minispiral remains unclear. Other molecules, such as
SO, SiO, H13CO+, are conﬁned to the CS emission peaks. It is
possibly an infalling clump, as suggested by earlier OH obser-
vation, which might consist of denser cloud cores embedded in
diﬀuse gas. The central association of clouds shows three times
higher CS/X (X: any other observed molecule) luminosity ratios
than the CND suggesting a combination of higher excitation - by
a temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping - and abundance en-
hancement due to UV- and/or X-ray emission. We conclude that
the association is closer to the center than the CND.
We ﬁnd emission at unexpectedly high velocities. Between
100 and 200 km s−1, we detect few SiO and CS clumps, where
the ﬁrst group has been interpreted as outﬂows from YSO, pre-
viously. Nevertheless, the common velocity ranges around 150
km s−1 might also hint at a connection between SiO and the CS
clumps, such as coming from another infalling tidally sheared
cloud.

Moreover, we identify two further intriguing regions. One of
them is the triop in the northwest of the center and located in

the CND. It is detected in almost all molecules observed pre-
viously and the ALMA observations presented here resolve its
ﬁlamentary structure for the ﬁrst time. The fact that it harbours
a class I methanol maser, and the detection of transitions with
high upper state energies (e.g. HC3N(26–25), Tu ∼ 160 K) point
at the possibility of hot core conditions and early stages of star
formation.

The other region is the northwestern tip of the CND SE. It
shows higher CS/X ratios than the CND, but not as high as the
center. The molecular species detected appear to form a layered
structure perpendicular to sightline to the center. Seemingly, it
becomes aﬀected by the radiation and or the winds from the nu-
clear stellar cluster.

Outside the CND, we ﬁnd the traditionally quiescent gas
tracer N2H+ coinciding with the largest IR dark clouds in the
ﬁeld. Methanol emission is found at and around previously de-
tected methanol class I masers which are assumed to be evoked
by large scale shocks from the Sgr A East shell. Since dark
clouds are likely to contain prestellar cores, these clouds make
another ideal candidate to investigate the earliest stages of star
formation.

Outlook: The observation yielded a collection of interesting
regions with properties distinct from the majority of CND clouds
and which deserve further investigation.

Our data clearly show a trend to more extreme conditions for
the molecular emission towards the center. In order to constrain
the density and temperature distribution, the excitation ladder of
speciﬁc tracers (e.g. density) has to be probed by observations
of several transitions per molecule spanning a wide range of J-
levels. In addition, the distribution of vibrationally excited CS,
SiO or HCN emission needs to be tested to infer the eﬀect of IR-
pumping on the excitation. Observation of atomic line emission
could mark the transition or link from molecular gas to ionized
gas and will help to understand the relations between the fea-
tures. For all of this, a higher spectral resolution than given in
this observation is mandatory. On the long term, a better con-
straint on the distance of the molecular and neutral clouds to Sgr
A* and their fate can be obtained when studying the proper mo-
tions.

The presence of e.g. CH3OH, HC3N and H2CO in the
warmer triop and the colder IR dark clouds calls for observations
of more complex hydrocarbons - and maybe deuterated species
- characteristic for the temperature and density dependent core
chemistry. The assessment of their properties might give hints
on the open questions on (recent) star formation in this turbulent
region.

The observations discussed have already proven the high ca-
pabilities of ALMA in early science cycle 0 so that we can look
forward to full array observations of the GC with ALMA.

Notes. Annotations: Sources without a letter before the number denote IRS sources. K and X sources are taken from Zhao et al. (2009), V sources from Viehmann et al. (2006), and SW, NE, and
X sources from Muži´c et al. (2007). Sources with A (ALMA) are detected for the ﬁrst time with this observation. u and n stand for "uniform" and "natural" weighting of the data, c for "convolved
source size" (deconvolution not possible), d for "devoured" (hidden in Gauss-wings from neighbouring strong sources). For details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4.

Notes. Annotations: Sources without a letter before the number denote IRS sources. K and X sources are taken from Zhao et al. (2009), V sources from Viehmann et al. (2006), and SW, NE, and
X sources from Muži´c et al. (2007). Sources with A (ALMA) are detected for the ﬁrst time with this observation. u and n stand for "uniform" and "natural" weighting of the data, c for "convolved
source size" (deconvolution not possible), d for "devoured" (hidden in Gauss-wings from neighbouring strong sources). For details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4.

Notes. Annotations: Sources without a letter before the number denote IRS sources. K and X sources are taken from Zhao et al. (2009), V sources from Viehmann et al. (2006), and SW, NE, and
X sources from Muži´c et al. (2007). Sources with A (ALMA) are detected for the ﬁrst time with this observation. u and n stand for "uniform" and "natural" weighting of the data, c for "convolved
source size" (deconvolution not possible), d for "devoured" (hidden in Gauss-wings from neighbouring strong sources). For details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4.

Notes. The spectra are obtained from an aperture with the size of the beam centered onto the average position of all integrated emission line peaks in the corresponding region (see Fig. A.10). For
details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4. (x) further velocity component for the same region; (ND) line peak below 3σrms-ch; (h) ﬁt failed - instead estimates given; (dp) close double peak (either due to two
velocity components or line multiplett/overlapping transition lines.

Notes. Ratios are obtained from a beamsized aperture of 0.65(cid:48)(cid:48) centered onto the average position of all integrated emission line peaks in the corresponding region (ﬁnding chart: Fig. A.10). For
ratios with N2H+, CH3OH(8–7), and 13CS a beamsized aperture of 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) is used. For details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4. SiO denotes the J = 6–5 transition; (20b,50b) velocity channel (typically
covering line centroid in the given region) at which the ratio has been taken from data cubes binned at 20 km s−1 and 50 km s−1 (band 3 lines); (numbers) alternative velocity channel.

Notes. Ratios are obtained from a beamsized aperture of 0.65(cid:48)(cid:48) centered onto the average position of all integrated emission line peaks in the corresponding region (ﬁnding chart: Fig. A.10). For
ratios with N2H+, CH3OH(8–7), and 13CS a beamsized aperture of 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) is used. For details on the procedure see Sect. 2.4. SiO denotes the J = 6–5 transition; (20b,50b) velocity channel (typically
covering line centroid in the given region) at which the ratio has been taken from data cubes binned at 20 km s−1 and 50 km s−1 (band 3 lines); (numbers) alternative velocity channel.
