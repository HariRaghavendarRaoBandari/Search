1. Introduction.

A multimodal map f : I → I is a smooth map deﬁned in an interval I, with a
ﬁnite number of critical points ci, all of them local maximum or local minimum,
and such that f (∂I) ⊂ ∂I. We are going to assume that f is real-analytic and all
its critical points have even order.

The understanding of the typical behaviour of a multimodal map is one of the
main open questions in the ﬁeld of one-dimensional dynamics. For unimodal maps
with a quadratic critical point, this understanding is far more satisfactory. Indeed,
Lyubich [16] proved that for almost every in the quadratic family the map is either
regular (a hyperbolic map) or stochastic (that is, the maps has a ergodic absolutely
continuous invariant measure). Avila, Lyubich and de Melo [2] generalised this

result for a non degenerate real analytic family of quadratic real analytic unimodal
maps and Avila and Moreira [3] improved this, proving that in a non degenerate
family the map is either regular or Collet-Eckmann at almost every parameter.
We say that a set Λ ⊂ I is a solenoidal attractor of a multimodal map f if there
exists an increasing sequence of positive intergers nk, k ∈ N, and a family of closed
intervals I k

j ⊂ I, k ∈ N and j < nk, such that

See Blokh and Lyubich [4] [5] for more information on attractors for multimodal
maps. The solenoidal attractor Λ has bounded combinatorics if

< ∞.

One important step in these previous results is to prove that at a typical param-
eter the map does not have solenoidal attractors. This was done in the quadratic
family by Lyubich [15] and for no degenerate families of unimodal maps by Avila,
Lyubich and De Melo [2]. An important tool in many of these results on uni-
modal maps is the fact that the topological classes of unimodal maps extends to an
analytic, codimension one lamination (except a few combinatorial types). This im-
plies that the holonomy of this lamination is quite regular. Our goal is to prove that

Theorem A. On a generic real-analytic ﬁnite-dimensional family of real-analytic
multimodal maps the set of parameters whose corresponding maps have a solenoidal
attractor with bounded combinatorics has zero Lebesgue measure.

We also have an analogous result for families with ﬁnite smoothness and continuous
families. The method used in the unimodal case in Avila, Lyubich and de Melo [2]
no longer works in the multimodal case, once the lamination of topological classes
has higher codimension, so we are going to use a quite diﬀerent approach. If a map
f has a solenoidal attractor with bounded combinatorics, one can ﬁnd an induced
map F of f that is a composition of unimodal maps and it is inﬁnitely renormaliz-
able as deﬁned in [22]. In particular the iterations of the renormalization operator
R for multimodal maps is well-deﬁned on F . The renormalization operator is a
real-analytic, compact and non-linear operator acting on a Banach space of real
analytic multimodal maps. Let Ω be the omega-limit set of the operator R. Our
main technical result is that

Theorem B. The omega-limit set Ω is a hyperbolic set.

Lyubich[14] proved the hyperbolicity of the omega-limit set in the unimodal case
using the so-called Small Orbits Theorem. We use a diﬀerent approach, reducing
the study of the hyperbolicity of Ω to the study of the existence and regularity of

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

solutions for a certain linear cohomological equation. This new method allows us
to deal only with real-analytic maps and its complex analytic extensions. Using
the universality property proved in [22] one can prove that F belongs to the stable
lamination of Ω. The ﬁnal ingredient is a very recent result on partially hyperbolic
invariant sets on Banach spaces [25], that will allows us to conclude that a generic
real-analytic ﬁnite-dimensional family of real-analytic multimodal maps intercepts
the stable lamination of Ω on a subset with zero Lebesgue measure. This will give
us our main result.

The relationship between renormalization and cohomological equations appears
in many contexts, as for instance in the study of rigidity of circle difeomorphisms
and generalized interval exchange transformations. Closer to our setting we have the
introduction by Lyubich [14] of the concept of horizontal direction in the study of
the renormalization operator for unimodal maps and the study of the hyperbolicity
of the ﬁxed point of the action of a pseudo-Anosov map on certain character variety
by Kapovich [12].

The study of the renormalization operator has a long history. It was ﬁrst dis-
covered in the unimodal case by Feigenbaum [8][9] and Coullet and Tresser [27].
They conjectured that the period-doubling renormalization operator has an unique
ﬁxed point in a space of quadratic unimodal maps, that this ﬁxed point is hyper-
bolic and its codimension one stable manifold contains all Feigenbaum maps. Such
conjectures could explain certain intriguing universal features of the bifurcation
diagram of families of unimodal maps. The existence and hyperbolicity of such
ﬁxed point was proven by Lanford [13]. Such conjectures were later extended for
arbitrary bounded combinatorial types, when the ﬁxed point need to be replaced
by an omega-limit set that is hyperbolic (see Derrida, Gervois and Pomeau [7]
and Gol’berg, Sina˘ı and Khanin [10]). Sullivan [26] proved that the orbit by the
renormalization operator of a map that is inﬁnitely renormalizable with bounded
combinatorics converges to the orbit of a map on the omega limit set and such orbit
is determined by the combinatorics of the map. This Sullivan’s result in particular
implies that uniqueness of the ﬁxed point to the period-doubling renormalization
operator and that it attracts all Feigenbaum maps. McMullen[18] proved that the
rate of convergence is indeed exponential. Finally Lyubich [14] proved that the
omega-limit set of the renormalization operator for unimodal maps is hyperbolic.
In particular Lyubich found a suitable space where the renormalization operator is
a complex-analytic non-linear operator. See also de Faria, de Melo and Pinto [6]
for the proof of the conjectures in the Cr case.

The renormalization operator for bimodal maps was ﬁrst considered in MacKay
and van Zeijts [17] and Hu [11]. The general multimodal case, with a precise com-
binatorial description, was described in [21], as well the so-called real and complex
a priori bounds for bounded combinatorics. In [23] it was proved the phase space
universality in the bounded combinatorics case. On this context the hyperbolicity
of the omega-limit set of the renormalization operator for multimodal maps with
bounded combinatorics is a far-reaching extension of the original Feigenbaum and
Coullet-Tresser conjectures.

2. Renormalization of extended maps.

To study the renormalisation of multimodal maps, it is more convenient to de-
compose the dynamics of f in its unimodal parts. Let Ii = [−1, ai], with ai > 0,

be intervals and

fi : Ii → Ii+1 mod n

be C1 maps such that 0 is its unique critical point, that is a maximum and fi(∂Ii) ⊂
Ii+1 mod n. An extended map F is deﬁned by a ﬁnite sequence (f1, . . . , fn) of maps
is the map deﬁned on I n

F = {(x, i) : x ∈ Ii, 1 ≤ i ≤ n} as

(1)

F (x, i) = (fi(x), i + 1 mod n)

We say that f is a multimodal map of type n if it can be written as a composition
of n unimodal maps: to be more precise, if there exist maps f1, . . . , fn with the
following properties

(1) The map

has an unique critical point (a maximum), and

fi : Ii → Ii+1 mod n

fi(∂Ii) ⊂ ∂Ii+1 mod n.

(2) f = fn ◦ · · · ◦ f1.
(3) If ci is the critical point of fi, then fi(ci) ≥ ci+1 mod n.

The n-uple (f1, ..., fn) is a decomposition of f . In this paper, we will assume that
the unimodal maps are analytic and the critical points of fi are quadratic ( but

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

5

observe that the critical points of f are not, in general, quadratic). Clearly f has
many decompositions.

In [21], we proved that deep renormalizations of inﬁnitely renormalizable multi-

modal maps are multimodal maps of type n.

2.1. Renormalization of extended maps. We say that J is a k-periodic interval,
k ≥ 2, of the extended map F if

• (c1, 0) ∈ J ((ci, i) are the critical points of F ),
• {J, F (J), . . . , F k−1(J)} is an union of intervals with disjoint interior,
• The union of intervals in the above family contains {(ci, i)},
• F k(J) ⊂ J, for k > n.

We will call k the period of J. If F has a k-periodic interval, for some k, we say
that F renormalizable.

Suppose that there exists a k-periodic interval for F and there is not j-periodic
interval with j < k. Let P ⊂ I × {1} be the maximal interval which is a k-periodic
interval for F . Then F k(∂P ) ⊂ ∂P . We say that P is a restrictive interval for
F of period k. Note that if P and ˜P are, respectively, restrictive intervals for F
of period k and ˜k, k < ˜k, then ˜P ⊂ P . Let P be a restrictive interval and let
0 = ℓ1 < · · · < ℓn = n be the iterations such that (ci, i) ∈ F ℓj (P ) for some i. Let
Pj be the symmetrization of F ℓj (P ) in relation to (ci, i). Observe that Pj contains
a periodic point in its boundary. If (ci, i) ∈ Pj Let

APj : C × {i} → C × {j}

be the aﬃne map which maps (ci, i) to (0, j) and this periodic point to −1. Then
gj = APj+1 ◦ F ℓj+1−ℓj ◦ A−1
is a unimodal map. The extended map G(x, i) =
Pj
(gi(x), i + 1 mod n) is called a renormalization of the extended map F . A ex-
tended may have many renormalizations, but at most one with a given period. The
renormalization with minimal period k is called the ﬁrst renormalization of F , and
it is denoted R(F ).

The primitive marked combinational data (m.c.d) associated with the ﬁrst renor-

malization of F is σ =< A, ≺, Ac, π > where

• A = {1, 2, . . . , k − 1},
• The relation ≺ is a partial order on A deﬁned in the following way i ≺ k if
F iJ and F kJ belongs to the same interval in In and F iJ is on the left side
of F kJ,

• The set Ac is a subset of A and i ∈ Ac if F iJ intersects {(ci, i)},
• The map π : A → A is deﬁned as π(i) = k if F (F iJ) ⊂ F kJ.

The extended map R(F ) can be renormalizable again and so on. If this process
can be continued indeﬁnitely, we say that F is inﬁnitely renormalizable. If F is
inﬁnitely renormalizable then all of its renormalizations can be obtained iterating
the operator R. Denote by P k
0 the restrictive interval associated to the k-th renor-
malization Rk(F ). If q ∈ C(F ) := {(ci, i)}, denote by the corresponding capital
letter Qk
0 ) which contains q. We reserve
the letter p for (c1, 1). The critical point r for F will be the successor of the critical
point q at level k if r ∈ F ℓ(Qk
0) contains a critical
point. Deﬁne nk
r , there exists an
interval Rk

r = ℓ. Then, for any r ∈ C(F ), k ∈ N and i < nk

0 the symmetrization of the interval F ℓ(P k

• The interval F nk

For details, see [21].

Denote by Nk the period of the restrictive interval P k

0 . We say that F has

C-bounded combinatorics if Nk+1/Nk ≤ C for every k.

For (x, i), (y, j) ∈ In, we say that (x, i) < (y, j) if i = j and x < y. The intervals
of In are the sets J × {i}, for some J ⊂ I and i < n. If ci is the critical point of fi,
denote C(F ) = {(i, ci)}i.

Let F and G be two inﬁnitely renormalizable extended maps. We say that F
and G have same combinatorics if F i(ck) < F j(cℓ) if and only if Gi(ck) < Gj(cℓ),
for any i,j ≥ 0 and k and ℓ < n.

Let σi be the m.c.d. of the (ﬁrst) renormalization of Ri(F ) and ˜σi be the m.c.d.
of the (ﬁrst) renomalization of Ri(G).
It turns out that F and G has the same
combinatorics if and only if σi = ˜σi for every i. Moreover, let Cp
n be the set of all
primitive m.c.d. that appears as the ﬁrst renormalization of an extended map with
n intervals and it has period either smaller or equal to p. Then given a sequence
σi ∈ ∪pCp
n, i ≥ 1, there exists a real analytic extended map (with, say, quadratic
critical points) whose i-th renormalization has m.c.d. σi.

2.2. Polynomial-like extended maps. Denote Cn = {(x, i) : x ∈ C, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
(in other words, Cn is a disjoint union of n copies of C). Given an open set O ⊂ Cn,
denote

A polynomial-like extended map is a map F : U → V , where

Oi = O ∩ C × {i}.

• U and V are open sets of Cn, where U ⊂ V ,
• for each i, F (Ui) = Vi+1 mod n. Moreover F : Ui → Vi+1 mod n is a proper

map with a unique critical point.

• for each i we have that Ui and Vi are simply connected domains.

We deﬁne

mod (V \ U ) = min

i

mod (Vi \ Ui).

The ﬁlled-in Julia set K(F ) of a polynomial-like extended map F is deﬁned as

K(F ) = ∩i≥0F −i(V ).

Note that K(F ) connected if and only if all the critical points of F belongs to
K(F ).

A real analytic extended map F : In → In has a polynomial-like extension if
there is a polynomial-like extend map ˜F : U → V such that I × {i} ⊂ Ui and
F = ˜F on In.

2.3. Polynomial-like renormalization of real analytic extended maps. Let
U ⊂ Cn be an open set. Given an analytic function F : U → Cn, deﬁne the open
set

U (F ) :=

F −iU.

In other words, Dn

U (F ) is the domain contained in Cn where F n is deﬁned.

Let F : U → V be a complex-analytic extension of an extended map. Note that F
does not need to be a polynomial-like extension. Suppose that the extended map F

is r-times renormalizable, and let Pj and ℓj be the intervals and integers associated
with the rth renormalization, as deﬁned in Section 2.1. Deﬁne nk = ℓk+1 mod n −ℓk.
Suppose we can ﬁnd a sequence ik, k = 1, . . . , n, with i1 = 1, simply connected

domains ˆUk and ˆVk ⊂ C × {ik}, such that

1. We have {ik}k = {1, 2, . . . , n},
2. We have Pk ⊂ ˆUk and ˆUk ⊂ ˆVk,
3. The domains ˆUk and ˆVk satisﬁes ˆUk ⊂ Dnk
4. The map

U (F ), F nk ˆUk = ˆVk+1 mod n.

F nk : ˆUk → ˆVk+1 mod n

is a proper map for which (0, ik) is the unique critical point.

Let Aj : C → C be the aﬃne maps deﬁned in Section 2.1. Deﬁne A : Cn → Cn

as A(x, i) = (Ai(x), i). Then we can deﬁne

as gj = A ◦ F nk ◦ A−1. If
ˆU = [i

then the map

gi : A( ˆUj) → A( ˆVj+1)

A( ˆUi) × {i}, ˆV = [i

A( ˆVi) × {i},

Rr(F ) : ˆU → ˆV

deﬁned by Rr(F )(x, i) = (gi(x), i + 1) is a polynomial-like extension of the real
renormalization Rr(F ) and it is called a polynomial-like rth renormalization of
F . Note that ˆUk and ˆVk are not uniquely deﬁned, however any polynomial-like
extension of Rr(F ) does coincide on In.

2.4. Complex bounds and rigidity of real analytic, inﬁnitely renormal-
izable extended maps with bounded combinatorics. Here we summarize
results in [22].

Theorem 1. Let σ = (σi)i∈Z ∈ C Z
analytic maps Fσ,i, i ∈ Z, satisfying the following conditions

p,n. Then there exists a unique sequence of real

1. The map Fσ,i is renormalizable and R(Fσ,i) = Fσ,i+1.
2. The ﬁrst renormalization of Fσ,i has combinatorics σi.
3. There exist polynomial-like extensions Fσ,i : U i

Theorem 2. (Complex Bounds [21]) There exists ǫ0 > 0 with the following prop-
erty.
If F is a real analytic extended map that is inﬁnitely renormalizable with
combinatorics in Cp,n and with a complex analytic (but not necessarily polynomial-
like) extension F ∈ B(U ) then there exist a neighbourhood VF ⊂ B(U ) of F and
k0 such that for every k ≥ k0 and every inﬁnitely renormalizable G ∈ VF with
combinatorics in Cp,n the map G has a polynomial-like kth renormalization

such that

Rk(G) : U k → V k

mod(V k \ U k) > ǫ0.

If V ⊂ C is a bounded open set such that 0, −1 ∈ U , denote by B(U ) the Banach
space of all holomorphic functions g : U → C that has a continuous extension to U
and a critical point at 0, with the sup norm, and by Bnor(U ) the aﬃne subspace of
maps g ∈ B(U ) such that g(−1) = −1.

In an analogous way, let U ⊂ Cn be a bounded open set such that Ui = (C ×
{i}) ∩ U 6= ∅ and (0, i), (−1, i) ∈ U for every i and consider the set B(U ) of all
holomophic functions G : U → Cn with the following properties:

1. G has a continuous extension to U .
2. G has critical points at (0, i), for every i.
3. G(Ui) ⊂ C × {i + 1 mod n}.

We can also consider the subset Bnor(U ) of all maps G ∈ B(U ) such that G(−1, i) =
(−1, i + 1 mod n) for every i.

Denote π(x, i) = x. We identify B(U ) with the Banach space

(2)

B(π(U1)) × B(π(U2)) × · · · × B(π(Un))

in the following way. For each G ∈ B(U ) there is a unique decomposition

(3)

(g1, . . . , gn) ∈ B(π(U1)) × B(π(U2)) × · · · × B(π(Un)),

where gi is deﬁned by gi(x) = π ◦ G(x, i) and for each n-uple as in (3) we can asso-
ciate G ∈ B(U ) deﬁned by G(x, i) = (gi(x), i + 1 mod n). With this identiﬁcation
Bnor(U ) turns out to be an aﬃne subspace of B(U ).

Given δ > 0 and θ > 0, let Dδ,θ be the set

{z ∈ C such that dist(x, [−1, 1]) < δ and |Im(x)| < θ(Re(x) + 1)} × {1, . . . , n}

Deﬁne

Indeed, due Theorem 1 we have that

Ωp,n = {Fσ,0}σ∈C Z

p,n

Ωp,n = {Fσ,i}σ∈C Z

for every i. Using Theorem 2 and Theorem 1 one can show that there exists ǫ0 such
that for every Fσ,0 ∈ Ωp,n there exists a polynomial-like extension Fσ0 : U 0
σ → V 0
σ
such that mod(V 0
σ) > ǫ0. There exists δ0 such that for every simply connected
domains Q ⊃ W ⊃ [−1, 1] such that mod(W \ Q) ≥ ǫ0/2 we have

σ \ U 0

{z ∈ C such that dist(x, [−1, 1]) ≤ δ0} ⊂ Q.

In particular

Dδ0,θ ⊂ U 0
σ

for every θ > 0 and for every σ ∈ Cp,n. In particular Ωp,n ⊂ Bnor(Dδ0,θ).

Consider the shift operator on C Z

p,n, that is, if σ = (σi)i∈Z then S(σ) = σ′, where

i = σi+1.

3. Complexification of the renormalization operator R.

Given θ0 > 0, by Theorem 2 for each F ∈ Ωp,n there exist a neighbourhood VF ⊂
B(Dδ0,θ0) of F and kF such that for every G ∈ VF that is inﬁnitely renormalizable
with combinatorics in Cp,n and for every k ≥ kF we have a polynomial-like kth
renormalization Rk(G) : ˆU → ˆV with mod( ˆV \ ˆU ) > ǫ0.
In particular Rk(G) ∈
Bnor(Dδ0,θ0). Since Ωp,n is a compact set, choose a ﬁnite sub cover {VFi}i≤ℓ of
Ωp,n. Let k0 = maxi≤ℓ kFi . Let V = ∪i≤ℓVFi .

Given F ∈ Ωp,n, consider the intervals PF,j, j = 1, . . . , n, integers nj, correpond-
ing the restrictive intervals of the k0th renormalization of F , as in Section 2.3. Each
interval PF,j contains a repelling periodic point (βF,j, ij). These repelling periodic
points have a complex analytic continuation (βG,j, ij) for every G in a neighbour-
hood WF of F in Bnor(Dδ0,θ0). Reduce WF so we can assume that WF ⊂ V and for
every inﬁnitely renormalizable extended map G ∈ WF with combinatorics in Cp,n
its ﬁrst k0 renormalizations have the same combinatorial type of the corresponding
renormalizations of F .

Let AG,j : C × {ij} → C × {j} be the aﬃne transformation that maps (βG,j, ij)
to (−1, j) and (0, ij) to (0, j), and A : Cn → Cn as AG(x, i) = (AG,i(x), i). Let
DF,j be the set

A−1

F,j{z ∈ C such that dist(z, [−1, 1]) < δ0 and |Im(z)| < θ(Re(z) + 1)} × {j}.

Since mod( ˆV \ ˆU ) > ǫ0 we have that

DF,j ⊂ ˆUj ⊂ Dnj

Dδ0 ,θ

(F ),

Moreover, reducing θ0 and δ0 we can assume that the interior of the sets in the
family

{F m(DF,j)}m<nj

are pairwise disjoint, and the intersection of every two of those sets is contained in

{F m(βF,j, ij)}m<nj .

Reducing the neighbourhood WF of F and θ0 we can assume that if we deﬁne Let
DG,j be the set

A−1

G,j{z ∈ C such that dist(z, [−1, 1]) < δ0 and |Im(z)| < θ(Re(z) + 1)} × {j}.

for every G ∈ WF and furthermore the interior of the sets in the family

deﬁned exactly as in (4). Let

˜R : W → Bnor( ˜U ).

i : Bnor( ˜U ) → Bnor(U )

be the compact linear inclusion between these spaces. Then R = i ◦ ˜R, so the
complexiﬁcation of the renormalization operator is a strongly compact operator as
deﬁned in [25].

Let v ∈ TGBnor(U ). If z ∈ U and Gj(z) ∈ U for every j < i then (G + tv)i is

Theorem 3. Let F ∈ W. Then DF R is dense in TRF Bnor(U ).

Proof. The proof is quite similar to the proof of the analogous statement in [2]. Let
w ∈ TRF Bnor(U ). Then w(−1, k) = 0 and w′(0, k) = 0 for every k. We are going
to deﬁne a function

in the following way. Deﬁne the function ˆv as 0 on

ˆv : ∪j ∪m<nj Gm(DG,j) → C

∪j ∪0<m<nj Gm(DG,j),

and

ˆv(z) = [DGnj −1(G(z))]−1 · w ◦ AG,j(z)

for z ∈ DG,j. Also deﬁne ˆv(−1, k) = 0 for every k. Then ˆv is well deﬁned, it is
continuous on

Λ = ∪j ∪m<nj Gm(DG,j) ∪ {(−1, k)}k,

and it is complex analytic in the interior of Λ.

Moreover ˆv vanishes on the orbit of the periodic points {βG,j}j. Since C× {i} \ Λ
is a connected set, by Mergelyan’s Theorem for each given ǫ > 0 and i we can ﬁnd
a polynomial qi such that |ˆv(z) − qi(z)| < ǫ for z ∈ Λi = Λ ∩ C × {i}. Deﬁne

ˆqi(z) = qi(z) − q′

i(0, i)z − qi(−1, i) − q′

i(0, i)

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

Note that ˆq′
q ∈ TGBnor(U ) and

i(0, i) = 0 and ˆqi(−1, i) = 0. Deﬁne q(x, i) = ˆqi(x). We have that

|DGR · q − w|B(U) →ǫ→0 0.

4. Action of DR on horizontal directions.

4.1. Horizontal direction. Let F : I n
F be a real analytic extended map
that is either inﬁnitely renormalizable with bounded combinatorics in Cp,n or whose
critical points belongs to the same periodic orbit. A continuous function

F → I n

v : I n

F → T Cn

is a horizontal direction of F if

1. For each x ∈ I n
2. The function v is real analytic in the interior of I n
F .
3. There is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld

F we have v(x) ∈ TF (x)Cn.

α : W → T Cn,

deﬁned in a complex neighbourhood W of the post critical set of F , such
that

(6)

v(x) = α(F (x)) − DF (x) · α(x)

for every x in the post critical set.

4. We have α(c) = 0 for every critical point c of F .

Given F ∈ Ωn,p, denote by Eh

F the set of v ∈ TF Bnor(U ) such that v is horizontal.

Of course Eh

F is a linear subspace of TF Bnor(U ).

Proposition 4.1 (Inﬁnitesimal pullback argument. Avila, Lyubich and de Melo
[2]). Let F ∈ Ωn,p and v ∈ TF Bnor(U ) such that there exists a quasiconformal
vector ﬁeld α, deﬁned in a neighbourhood of the post critical set of F , such that

(7)

v(x) = α ◦ F (x) − DF (x) · α(x)

for every x ∈ P (F ), that is, v ∈ Eh

F . Let
F : W → V

be a polynomial-like extension of F . Reducing a little bit the domain W , there
exists a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld extension α : W → C such that (7) holds for
every x ∈ W .

Indeed, consider ai as in (5). Note that

ai(z) = v(F i−1) + DF (F i−1(z))ai−1(z).

By an inductive argument one can show that

Let z be a point very close to the post critical set of F . Then

Let k(z) be a minimal element of the above set. Not hat z 7→ k(z) is locally
constant. We deﬁne α(z) for z close to the post critical set of F by induction of

k(z). We already deﬁned α(z) when k(z) = 0. If k(z) > 0 then k(F (z)) = k(z) − 1
and we deﬁne

v(z) + α(F (z))

.

α(z) =

DF (z)

One can check that α is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld and

v = α(F (z)) − DF (z)α(z)

in a neighbourhood of the post critical set of F , so v ∈ Eh
F .

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.3. Let F ∈ Ωn,p. Then DRF is injective.

Proof. Let v be such that DRF ·v = 0. By Proposition 4.2 we have that v ∈ Eh
F . By
Proposition 4.1 there is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld α, deﬁned in a neighborhood
of the Julia set of F , satisfying (7) for every x on its Julia set. Let r(α) be the
quasiconformal vector ﬁeld deﬁned by (10). Then by (11) we have that r(α) satisﬁes

0 = r(α) ◦ (RF )(z) − Dz(RF ) · r(α)(z).

for every z in the Julia set of RF . We can easily conclude that r(α)(z) = 0 at
every repelling periodic point z of RF and consequently at every point of its Julia
set. By (10) we have that α is zero at every point of the small Julia sets of F
corresponding to this renormalization and, by (7) we have that v vanishes in these
small Julia sets as well. So v = 0 everywhere.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.4 (Closeness). Let Fk ∈ Ωn,p and vn ∈ Eh
F ⊂ TF Bnor(U ) be
sequences such that (Fk, vk) converges to (F, v) ∈ Bnor(U ) × T Bnor(U ). Then
F ∈ Ωp,n and v ∈ Eh

F is Banach subspace of TF Bnor(U ).

F . In particular Eh

Proof. Due the deﬁnition of the operator R, the map RF has a polynomial-like
extension

RF : W → V,

with U ⊂ W . Reducing V a little bit, we can assume ∂V is an analytic circle and
that for k large enough the map

RFk : Wk → V,

where Wk ⊂ Cn, U ⊂ Wk, is the set whose connected components are the connected
components of

(RFk)−1V

that intercepts {(0, j)}j, is a polynomial-like extension of RFk. Since vk ∈ Eh

, so there exists a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld ˜γk such

(DRFk · vk)(z) = ˜γk ◦ (RFk)(z) − Dz(RFk) · ˜γk(z).

holds for z in a neighbourhood of the post critical set of RFk.

Now we use the inﬁnitesimal pullback argument in Avila, Lyubich and de Melo
0 : Cn → C

[2]. For each k, there exist C > 0 and a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld γk
with the following properties

1. The vector ﬁeld γk

for every z ∈ ∂Wk.

V \ Wk

|∂γk

on this set.

0 = ˜γk in a neighbourhood of the post critical set of RFk.

γk
j ◦ (RFk)(z) − (DRFk · vk)(z)

Dz(RFk)

on V \ {(0, m)}m, and γk

j+1(0, m) = 0.

Using the McMullen compactness criterium for quasiconformal vectors ﬁelds [18],

one can prove that for each k the sequence

ˆγk
j =

1

γk

has a convergent subsequence, uniform on compact subsets of Cn. Moreover such
limits are quasiconformal vectors ﬁelds. Let γk
∞ be one of theses limits. Since the
ﬁlled-in Julia sets of the polynomial-like extensions of RFk do not support invariant
line ﬁelds [22] we conclude that |∂γk

∞| ≤ C on Cn. Note that

(13)

(DRFk · vk)(z) = γk

∞ ◦ (RFk)(z) − Dz(RFk) · γk

∞(z), z ∈ U .

By the compactness criterium for quasiconformal vectors ﬁelds in McMullen [18]
we can consider a convergent subsequence γkt ∞ →t γ, where γ is a quasiconformal
vector ﬁeld on Cn and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of Cn . By
(13) we have

(14)
so DRF · v ∈ Eh

(DRF · v)(z) = γ ◦ (RF )(z) − Dz(RF ) · γ(z), z ∈ U ,
RF , so by (9) we have v ∈ Eh
F .

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.5 (Contraction on the horizontal directions). There exist K and
θ1 > 1 such that for every F ∈ Ωn,p and v ∈ Eh
|DF Ri · v|T Bnor(U) ≤ Kθ1

F we have
−i|v|T Bnor(U).

Proposition 4.6 (Contraction on the hybrid classes). There exists λ1 with the
following property. Let F be a real-analytic polynomial-like map of type n that
is inﬁnitely renormalizable with combinatorics bounded by p. Then there exist a
unique G ∈ Ωn,p and k0 = k0(F ) and C = C(F ) such that RkF ∈ B(U ) for every
k ≥ k0 and

|RkF − RkG|Bnor(U) ≤ Cλk

1 for k ≥ k0.

Proof. One can prove this in a quite similar way to the proof of the main result in
[22]. An alternative proof is obtained using Proposition 4.5 and the same argument
as in the proof of Theorem 1 in [23].
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.7. Let G ∈ Ωp,n. Then there exist polynomial-like maps of type n

such that

Gi : ˆU i → ˆV i

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

15

A. For large i we have mod ˆV i \ ˆU i ≥ ǫ0/2. In particular Gi ∈ Bnor(U ).
B. For each i, all critical points of Gi belong to the same periodic orbit.
C. For large i we have

lim

i

|Gi − G|Bnor (U) = 0.

Proof. We will use the notation introduced in [22]. Let σ = (σ1, σ2, . . . ) be the
combinatorics of G. By Proposition 2.2 in [22], there exists a sequence of polyno-
mial Pi of type n with combinatorics σi ⋆ · · · ⋆ σ1. By Corollary 2.3 in [22] any
accumulation point of this sequence is a polynomial P of type n that is inﬁnitely
renormalizable with combinatorics σ. By the proof of Theorem 2 in [22] there is
only one polynomial of type n with combinatorics σ, so the sequence Pi indeed
converges to P .

Since G ∈ Ωp,n there exist domains ˆU and ˆV , whose boundaries are analytic
circles, such that mod ˆV \ ˆU > ǫ0/2 and G : ˆU → ˆV is a polynomial-like map of
type n. Since Pi is a convergent sequence of polynomials of type n with connected
Julia sets, it is possible to choose domains ˆU i and ˆV i such that

- inf i mod ˆV i and ˆU i > 0,
- Pi : ˆU i → ˆV i is a polynomial-like map of type n.

and furthermore for some K > 0 there are K-quasiconformal maps

φi : Cn → Cn

such that

- φi( ˆU i) = ˆU and φi( ˆV i) = ˆV ,
- φi(z) = φi(z),
- Pi : ˆU i → ˆV i is a polynomial-like map of type n,
- G ◦ φi = φi ◦ Pi on ∂ ˆU i.
- The sequence φi converges to a K-quasiconformal map φ.
- If ˆU ∞ = φ−1( ˆU ) and ˆV ∞ = φ−1( ˆV ) then P : ˆU ∞ → ˆV ∞ is a polynomial-

like map of type n.

Let µi be the Beltrami ﬁeld that coincides with µi = ∂φi/∂φi on Cn \ ˆU i, that
is invariant under Pi, and µi = 0 on K(Pi). Let ψi : Cn → Cn be the unique
quasiconformal map such that ψi(−1, j) = (−1, j) and ψi(0, j) = (0, j) for every j,
and µi = ∂ψi/∂ψi on Cn. Deﬁne

Then

Gi = ψi ◦ Pi ◦ ψ−1

i

.

Gi : ψi( ˆU i) → ψi( ˆV i)

is a polynomial-like map of type n. Note that

inf
i

mod ψi( ˆV i) \ ψi( ˆU i) > 0.

Every subsequence of Gi has a convergent subsequence. Let F be one these ac-
cumulation points. We claim that F = G. Note that every accumulation point
is of the form F = ψ ◦ P ◦ ψ−1, where ψ is a K-quasiconformal map that is an
accumulation point of the sequence ψi. We can assume, without loss of generality,
that φi converges to a K-quasiconformal map φ.

Notice that

i

is conformal in Cn \ ˆU we conclude that ψ ◦ φ−1
for z ∈ ∂ ˆU . Moreover since ψi ◦ φ−1
is conformal in Cn \ ˆU . Since F and G are both inﬁnitely renormalizable with the
same combinatorics, one can use the Sullivan’s pullback argument to conclude that
there is quasiconformal conjugacy H between F : ˆU ∞ → ˆV ∞ and G : ˆU → ˆV such
that H is conformal in Cn \K(F ). Since there are not invariant line ﬁelds supported
of K(F ) we conclude that H in conformal on Cn, so H is aﬃne on each connected
component of Cn. Since H(−1, j) = (−1, j) and H(0, j) = (0, j) for every j, we
conclude that H is the identity. So F = G and Gi converges to G. Itens A., B. and
C. of Proposition 4.7 follows easily from this.

Then Ωn,p is a hyperbolic set. Moreover its stable direction is exactly Eh.

Proposition 5.1 reduces the study of the hyperbolicity of Ωn,p to the study of
the existence and regularity of the solutions α of the cohomological equation (6).
So to show that Ωn,p is a hyperbolic set it remains to prove

Theorem 4 (Key Lemma). If F ∈ Ωn,p then

We will prove Theorem 4 in Section 8. As an immediate consequence of Propo-

sition 5.1 and Theorem 4 we have

5.1. A criterium for hyperbolicity of cocycles. Let E be a topological vector
bundle with base Ω and ﬁber Rn and projection p : E → Ω. We also assume that Ω
is compact. We denote elements of E by (x, v), where x ∈ Ω and v ∈ p−1(x). Let
L : E → E be a ﬁber-preserving homeomorphism that is linear on the ﬁbers. The

such that for every (x, v) ∈ E we have

Proposition 5.2. The cocycle L : E → E is uniformly expanding if and only if

(18)

B+ = E0.

Proof. Of course if L : E → E is uniformly expanding then (18) holds. To prove the
reverse implication, note that (18) implies S = B = E0. By Theorem 2 in Sacker
and Sell [19] we have that L : E → E is uniformly expanding.
(cid:3)

One can prove Proposition 5.2 applying Sacker and Sell’s results in [20, Lemma
9 and Theorem 2]. We just refer to that because the proof of these results in [20]
seems to be more elementary than the proof of Theorem 2 in [19].

On TF Bnor(U )/Eh

F we use the norm

|[v]|F = dist(v, Eh

F ) = inf{|v − w|Bnor(U) : w ∈ Eh

Note that due Proposition 4.8 we have that

dim TF Bnor(U )/Eh

F = n.

By Proposition 4.2 the linear transformation

DRF : TF Bnor(U ) → TRF Bnor(U )

induces a linear transformation

By Theorem 3 we have that LF is invertible. By Proposition 4.4 the map

To simplify the notation, we will replace the operator R by its iteration Rj. The

following two corollaries are an immediate consequence of Corollary 5.5.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 5.1. Let K0 be as in Corollary 5.9. We claim that every cone
Cu
F (K0), with F ∈ Ωn,p, contains a subspace SF of dimension n.
Indeed, since
Eh
G, G ∈ Ωn,p, has ﬁnite codimension n there is a subspace EG ⊂ T Bnor(U ) of
dimension n such that

EG ⊕ Eh
G = T Bnor(U ).
Since Ωn,p is a Cantor set and G 7→ Eh
G is a continuous distribution, it is easy to see
that we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite covering {Oj}j by compact subsets of Ωn,p and subspaces
Ej with dimension n such that

Ej ⊕ Eh

G = T Bnor(U )

for every G ∈ Oj . By (21), Proposition 5.4 and Corollary 5.7 there exists i0 such
that

DRi0

G Ej ⊂ Cu

Ri0 G(K0).

for every G ∈ Oj. Moreover R is invertible on Ωn,p, so we can choose G such
that Ri0 G = F . Since DRG is injective for every G ∈ Ωn.p we conclude that
SF = DRi0
F (K0). This concludes the proof
of the claim. Note that

G Ej is a subspace of dimension n in Cu

SF ⊕ Eh

F = T Bnor(U ).

Let G ∈ Ωn,p. Since R is invertible on Ωn,p there is an unique sequence Gi ∈ Ωn,p
i be an arbritrary subspace of dimension

such that RGi+1 = Gi and G0 = G. Let S′

G(K0) ∩ Eh

we have that there is a linear function

G

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

23

such that {v + Hi(v), v ∈ SG} = DRi
v + Hi(v) = u1 + w1, with w1 ∈ Eh
G and

Gi (S′

i). Since v + Hi(v) ∈ Cu

G(K0) we have

|u1| ≤ eǫd(v + Hi(v), Eh

G) = eǫd(v, Eh

G) < eǫ|v|.

and |w1| ≤ K0|u1|. In particular

|Hi(v)| = |u1 + w1 − v| ≤ (1 + eǫ(1 + K0))|v|,

So the family of functions Hi is an equicontinuous family of functions. By the
strong compactness of the operator R and Arzela-Ascoli Theorem there exists a
subsequence that converges to a bounded linear function HG : SG → Eh
G satisfying

{v + HG(v), v ∈ SG} ⊂

Due (36) and the contraction in the horizontal directions we have that there is only

Then we can easily conclude that DRG(Eu

for every z ∈ P (F ) \ C(F ). Then

If |Dψ(t) ≤ Ct−1 then γ can be extended as a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on C such

for every z ∈ C \ {0}. To show that γ is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on C, by [1,
Lemma 3, page 53] there exists a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld ˜γ on C such that its
distributional derivative belongs to L2(C), it satisﬁes ∂˜γ(z) = 0 if |z| ≥ 1 and

∂˜γ(z) = ∂γ(z)

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

33

for almost every z satisfying |z| < 1. So γ − ˜γ is continuous on {z ∈ C :
|z| < 1}
and (by Weyl’s Lemma) holomorphic on {z ∈ C : 0 < |z| < 1}. By Riemann’s
Theorem on removable singularities we have that 0 is a removable singularity, so
γ − ˜γ is holomorphic on |z| < 1, and therefore γ is quasiconformal on C.
(cid:3)

An illustrative example of application of Lemma 8.4 is obtained considering

ψ(x) = log(x).

Proposition 8.5. Let v ∈ B+(F ). There exists a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld

Since for every (z, a) ∈ Cn \ C(F ), there exists an open neighbourhood of (z, a) that
intersects only one of the supports of the functions in the family F , we conclude
that α1 is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on Cn \ C(F ). Since α1 is continuous at
C(F ), we can use the argument in the end of the proof of Lemma 8.4 to conclude
that α1 is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on Cn.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4. Let v ∈ B+(F ). Let α1 and α2 as in Proposition 8.5 and 8.6.
Deﬁne α0 = α1 + α2. Then by Lemma 8.1
(76)
for every (z, j) ∈ ∂D \ C(F ) and moreover α0(q) = 0 for every q ∈ C(F ). Now we
will use an argument similar to the inﬁnitesimal pullback argument for polynomial-
like maps [2]. We deﬁne by induction on m a sequence of quasiconformal vector
ﬁelds

V (z, j) = α0 ◦ G(z, j) − DG(z, j) · α0(z, j)

αm : Cn → C

such that αm(q) = 0 for every q ∈ C(F ),

(77)

V (z, j) = αm ◦ G(z, j) − DG(z, j) · αm(z, j)

for every (z, j) ∈ ∂D and moreover

(78)

V (z, j) = αm−1 ◦ G(z, j) − DG(z, j) · αm(z, j)

for every (z, j) ∈ D, m ≥ 1 and

sup
Cn

|∂αm+1| ≤ sup
Cn

|∂αm|.

Indeed, suppose by induction we have deﬁned αk. Deﬁne αk+1(z, j) = αk(z, j) for
every (z, j) 6∈ D and

(79)

αk+1(z, j) =

αk(G(z, j)) − V (z, j)

DG(z, j)

for every (z, j) ∈ D. Note that

|∂αk+1(z, j)| = |∂αk(z, j)|,

for every (z, j) 6∈ D and

|∂αk+1(z, j)| = |∂αk(G(z, j))|

for (z, j) ∈ D. So αk+1 is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld in Cn \ ∂D. Moreover
(78) holds for m = k + 1 and due (77) with m = k we have that αk+1 = αk on
∂D \ C(F ), so αk+1 is continuous at points in

∂D \ C(F ).

If (z, j) ∈ ∂D \ C(F ) then (z, j) ∈ ∂Rn
−i, for some r ∈ C(F ). In particular there

that αk+1 is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on W . So αk+1 is a quasiconformal vec-
tor ﬁeld on Cn \ C(F ). Finally notice that αk+1 is continuous at points in C(F ).
Indeed, suppose that

If (zℓ, i) 6∈ D for every ℓ then

(zℓ, i) →ℓ (0, i).

lim
ℓ→∞

αk+1(zℓ, i) = lim
ℓ→∞

αk(zℓ, i) = 0.

If (zℓ, i) ∈ D for every ℓ then

lim
ℓ→∞

αk+1(zℓ, i) = lim
ℓ→∞

αk(G(zℓ, i)) − V (zℓ, i)

DG(zℓ, i)

.

Since the accumulation points of the sequence G(zℓ, i) belongs to C(F ) we have

By Lemma 8.3 it follows that

lim
ℓ→∞

αk(G(zℓ, i)) = 0.

lim
ℓ→∞

V (zℓ, i) = 0.

Since by the complex bounds we have that

we conclude by (80) that

inf

(z,j)∈D

|DG(z, j)| > 0

αk+1(zℓ, i) = 0.

lim
ℓ→∞

so αk+1 is continuous at points in C(F ). By the same argument in the end of the
proof of Lemma 8.4 we conclude that αk+1 is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld on Cn
and

Given a point (z, j) ∈ Cn such that there exists k0 ≥ 0 such that Gk(z, j) ∈ D
for every k < k0 and Gk0 (z, j) 6∈ D, we claim that αk(z, j) = αk0 (z, j) for every
k ≥ k0. Note that αk(z, j) = α0(z, j) for every (z, j) 6∈ D, so the claim holds for
k0 = 0. Suppose by induction on k0 that the claim hold for k0. If Gi(z, j) ∈ D for
i ≤ k0 and Gk0+1(z, j) 6∈ D then Gi(G(z, j)) ∈ D for i < k0 and Gk0 (G(z, j)) 6∈ D,
so by the induction assumption αk(G(z, j)) = αk0 (G(z, j)) for every k ≥ k0. Since
G(z, j) ∈ D we have by (79) that

αk+1(z, j) =

αk(G(z, j)) − V (z, j)

DG(z, j)

=

αk0 (G(z, j)) − V (z, j)

DG(z, j)

= αk0+1(z, j),

for every k ≥ k0, which proves the claim.
By Proposition 6.2 the sequence αk converges converges almost everywhere. By
(81) and McMullen [18] we have that every subsequence αk has a subsequence that
converges uniformly to some quasiconformal vector ﬁeld. So αk converges uniformly
to a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld α. Taking m → ∞ in (78) we conclude that

(82)

V (z, j) = α ◦ G(z, j) − DG(z, j) · α(z, j),

for every (z, j) ∈ D and in particular for every (z, j) ∈ P (F )\ C(F ). Since α(q) = 0
for every q ∈ C(F ), by Corollary 7.3 we conclude that v ∈ Eh(F ).

Proposition 9.1. There is γ > 0 with the following property. Suppose that
F ∈ Bnor(U ), that F has a polynomial-like extension F : V 0 → V 1 such that
mod V 1 \ V 0 > ǫ0 and

for some G ∈ Ωp,n. Then if

distBnor(U)(F, G) < γ,

v ∈ Eh

F ∩ Cu(G)

and v ∈ B(V 0) ∩ B(U ) then v = 0. Here ǫ0 is as deﬁned in Theorem 2.

Proof. Suppose by contradiction that there exist sequences Gi ∈ Ωp,n, Fi ∈ Bnor(U )
and vi ∈ B(V 0

i ) such that

- We have

distBnor(U)(Fi, Gi) →i 0,

- The maps Fi have a polynomial-like of type n extension Fi : V 0

i → V 1

i and

mod V 1

i \ V 0

i > ǫ0.

- The vectors satisfy vi ∈ Eh

Fi ∩ Cu(Gi), |vi|B(U) 6= 0 and vi ∈ B(V 0

i ).

Without loss of generality we can assume that |vi|B(U) = 1 for every i. Since
vi ∈ Eh(Fi), vi ∈ B(V 0
i are a polynomial-like maps of type n and
mod V 1
i > ǫ0, one can use the inﬁnitesimal pullback argument to conclude that
there exist quasiconformal vector ﬁelds αi : Cn → C with supi |∂αi|∞ < ∞ such
that

i ) and Fi : V 0

i \V 0

(83)

vi = αi ◦ Fi − DFi · αi

on U . By a compactness argument [18] the sequence αi has a convergent subse-
quence that converges to quasiconformal vector ﬁeld α. Since |vi|B(U) = 1 and
vi ∈ B(V 0

i ), there exist C and δ′ > δ such that

|vi|B(Dδ′ ) ≤ C,

in particular there exists a subsequence of vi that converges to some v on B(Dδ)
satisfying |v|B(Dδ ) = 1. Since Ωp,n is compact, without loss of generality we can
assume that Gi (and so Fi) converges to some G ∈ Ωp,n. By Eq. (83) we obtain

v = α ◦ G − DG · α

on the pos-critical set of G. Since there are not invariant line ﬁelds supported in
the Julia set of G, by the inﬁnitesimal pullback argument we conclude that v ∈ Eh
G.

Since λ < 1 < θ, this contradicts (84) and (85).

Proposition 9.2. For every δ′ > 0 small enough the following holds. Let H be a

G(u0, δ′) such

Proof. Deﬁne

˜H : Bu

G(u0, δ′) × {v ∈ Eh(G) :

|v| ≤ δ′} → Bnor(U )

as ˜H(u, v) = u + H(u) + v. Note that ˜H is a homeomorphism on its image, which
is an open neighbourhood of G and F . Deﬁne ˜H1(u, v) = R ˜H(u, v). If δ′ is small
enough there is a smooth family of domains ˆU(u,v) such that for every (u, v) in the
domain of ˜H1 we have that

˜H1(u, v) : ˆU(u,v) → ˆV

is a polynomial-like map of type n such that

mod ˆV \ ˆU(u,v) > ǫ0.

Reducing ˆV a little bit, for every

(w, z) ∈ Eu(G) × Eh(G)

we have

Du ˜H1(u, v) · w + Dv ˜H1(u, v) · z ∈ B( ˆU(u,v)).

If w ∈ Eu(G) \ {0} we have

so by Proposition 9.1,

(86)

Du ˜H1(u, v) · w ∈ Cu(RG).

Du ˜H1(u, v) · w 6∈ Eh

˜H1(u,v),

and moreover for every (w, z) ∈ Eu(G) × Eh(G) such that

Du ˜H1(u, v) · w + Dv ˜H1(u, v) · z ∈ Eh

˜H1(u,v),

we have

Du ˜H1(u, v) · w + Dv ˜H1(u, v) · z 6∈ Cu(RG).

(87)
The image of ˜H is an open neighbourhood of u0 + H(u0) ∈ Ωn,p, in particular
by Proposition 4.7 there exists (u1, v1) such that ˜H(u1, v1) is a map whose critical
points belong to the same periodic orbit, and consequently ˜H1(u1, v1) = R ˜H(u1, v1)
is also a map whose critical points belong to the same periodic orbit. Furthermore
one can choose (u1, v1) arbitrarily close to (u0, 0). If v1 = 0 choose w = u0 and
we ﬁnished the proof in this case. Otherwise v1 6= 0 and we consider the C1+Lip
smooth map

(u, t, x) ∈ Eu(G) × R × U 7→ f(u,t)(x) := ˜H1(u, tv1)(x).

The critical points of f(u1,1) belong to the same periodic orbit, so there are natural
numbers ik, k = 1, . . . , n and we can index the critical points

Crit = {(0, j)}0≤j≤n−1 = {(0, jk)}0≤k≤n−1

in such way that for every k ≤ n − 1

f ik
(u0,1)(0, jk) = (0, jk+1 mod n) and f i

(u0,1)(0, jk) 6∈ Crit f or i < ik.

42

DANIEL SMANIA

We claim that there is a function t 7→ u(t), deﬁned for every t ∈ [0, 1] such that

(88)

f ik
(u(t),t)(0, jk) = (0, jk+1 mod n) and f i

(u(t),t)(0, jk) 6∈ Crit f or i < ik,

for every k ≤ n − 1. Indeed, let Y be the set of q ∈ [0, 1] such that there exists a
continuous function u deﬁned on [q, 1] such that (88) holds for every t ∈ [q, 1] and
u(1) = u1. Note that 1 ∈ Y . We need to show that 0 ∈ Y . It is enough to show
that Y is a open and closed subset of [0, 1]. Indeed, suppose that (u2, t2) satisﬁes

(89)

f ik
(u2,t2)(0, jk) = (0, jk+1 mod n) and f i
for every k ≤ n − 1. Note that the linear map

(u2,t2)(0, jk) 6∈ Crit f or i < ik,

w 7→ (Duf ik

(u2,t2)(0, jk) · w)0≤k≤n−1

is invertible, otherwise it would exists w ∈ Eu(G) \ {0} such that

Duf ik

(u2,t2)(0, jk) · w = 0

for every k, so using the inﬁnitesimal pullback argument one can conclude that

Du ˜H1(u2, t2v1) · w ∈ Eh

˜H1(u2,t2v1),

which contradicts (86). So by the Implicit Function Theorem there exists an open
interval O with t2 ∈ O such that there is an unique continuous function u deﬁned
on O such that (88) holds for every t ∈ O and u(t2) = u2. We conclude that Y is
an open set and that for each q ∈ Y there exists an unique continuous function U
deﬁned on [q, 1] and satisfying and (88) and u(1) = u1. To show that Y is closed,
suppose that qn ∈ Y is a decreasing sequence converging to some q ∈ [0, 1]. Then
there exists an unique continuous function u deﬁned in (q, 1] such that u(1) = u1
and (88) holds. We claim that u is a Lipchitz function on (q, 1], so we can extend
it to a continuous function u deﬁned in [q, 1]. Indeed note that

so by (87)

(90)

Moreover

∂tf(u(t),t) ∈ Eh

f(u(t),t) ,

∂tf(u(t),t) 6∈ Cu(RG).

∂tf(u(t),t) = DRu(t)+H(u(t))+tv1 · (u′(t) + DuHu(t) · u′(t) + v1)

(91)

Let

y = DRu(t)+H(u(t))+tv1 · (u′(t) + DuHu(t) · u′(t)).

Note that

|y|RG,0 ≥ λ

which implies that ∂tf(u(t),t) ∈ Cu(RG). This contradicts (90). In particular there
is L satisfying |u′(t)|G,0 ≤ L|v1|G,0 for every t ∈ (q, 1] and consequently u is a
Lipchitz function. So we can extend u to a continuous map to [q, 1]. It is easy to
see that (88) also holds for t = q. We conclude that Y is closed. Since Y is an
open, closed, non empty subset of [0, 1] we conclude that Y = [0, 1], so in particular
0 ∈ Y and therefore there exists w such that f(w,0) = ˜H1(w, 0) = R(w + H(w))
is a map whose critical points belong to the same periodic orbit, and consequently
w + H(w) has the same property.
(cid:3)

Corollary 9.3 (Transversal Empty Interior). There exists λ2 ∈ (0, 1) such that for
every δ > 0 small enough the following holds. Let
H : Bu(v0, δ) → Eh

0 (GF , δ′). By Proposition 9.2 there is
w ∈ Bu
GF (F − GF ), δ′) such that w + HF (w) is a map such that all its critical
points belong to the same periodic orbit. In particular every map close enough to
w + HF (w) is a hyperbolic map with an attracting periodic orbit that attracts all
its critical points. In particular we can ﬁnd hyperbolic maps in ˆH arbitrarily close
to F . Note that hyperbolic maps do not belong to W s
(Ωn,p), since every map in

W s
(cid:3)

δ3 (Ωn,p) is inﬁnitely renormalizable.

10. Families of multimodal maps

Let V ⊂ C be a connected open set, symmetric with respect to the real line
(z ∈ V implies z ∈ V ) such that [−1, 1] ⊂ V . In this section we will denote by
BC by aﬃne subspace of B(V ) deﬁned by the restrictions f (−1) = f (−1) = −1.
Denote by BR the real Banach space of all functions f ∈ BC that are real on the
V ∩ R.

Given m ∈ N, let ΓωR

n (BR) be the set of all continuous functions

m

γ : D

→ BC

that are complex analytic on Dm and such that γ(λ) ∈ BR for every λ ∈ [−1, 1]m.
We can endow ΓωR

m (BR) with the sup norm.

44

DANIEL SMANIA

Let M ⊂ BR be the open subset of multimodal maps f : [−1, 1] → [−1, 1], where
−1 is a repelling ﬁxed point, f ′(1) 6= 0, with quadratic critical points and negative
schwarzian derivative and f (−1, 1) ⊂ (−1, 1).

Denote by Mn ⊂ ΓωR

n (BR) the subset of all families γ such that γ(λ) ∈ M for

every λ ∈ [−1, 1]n. Note that Mn is an open subset of ΓωR

n (BR).

Theorem 6 (Theorem A). For every γ in a generic subset of Mm, the set Λ of
parameters λ such that γ(λ) has (at least) one solenoidal attractor with bounded
combinatorics on (−1, 1) has zero Lebesgue measure.

Proof. Fix p, q, n ∈ N \ {0, 1}. Let Oq,n be the set of all pairs (f0, P0), with f ∈ M
satisfying

A. P0 is a restrictive interval of f0 involving n critical points and with a
repelling periodic point in its boundary, with period q′ < q. Moreover
f q′
0 (∂P0) ⊂ ∂P0.

B. The f0-forward orbit of any critical point on the orbit of such restrictive

interval P0 does not

fall in the orbit of such periodic point.

Fix (f0, P0) ∈ Oq,n. The repelling periodic point of f0 in the boundary of P0 has
an analytic continuation that is also repelling and it deﬁnes a restrictive interval
Pg for each map g in an open connected neighborhood V0 of f0 on M and such
restrictive interval also satisﬁes properties A and B. In particular the family F of
pairs (V, P ) where

1. V is an open and connected subset of M, with f0 ∈ V.
2. The real analytic function

g ∈ V 7→ P (g)

associate with each map g ∈ V a restrictive interval P (g) of g satisfying
properties A and B and moreover P (f0) = P0.

is non empty and consequently F has a maximal element with respect to the order
(V1, P1) < (V2, P2) if and only if V1 ⊂ V2 and P2(g) = P1(g) for every g ∈ V1. Such
maximal element is unique and we are going to denote it by Vf0,P0 . Note that

{Vf0,P0 : (f0, P0) ∈ Oq,n}

is a partition of Oq,n. Moreover one can easily see that such partition has a ﬁnite
number of elements.

For each pair (g, P (g)) ∈ Vf0,P0 , denote by Rg the extended map of type n that

is the renormalization of g associated with the restrictive interval P (g).

We claim that we can ﬁnd inside each Vf0,P0 a ﬁnite number of open subsets
V i
f0,P0 in such way that for every

(g, P (g)) ∈ Vf0,P0 \ ∪iV i

f0,P0

the map Rg is not inﬁnitely renormalizable with p-bounded combinatorics. More-
over on each V i

f0,P0 we can deﬁne a real analytic map

satisfying

If : V i

f,P → W,

i. The function If (g) is an extended map of type n that is a renormalization

of Rg,

SOLENOIDAL ATTRACTORS WITH BOUNDED COMBINATORICS ARE SHY

45

ii. If Rg is inﬁnitely renormalizable with p-bounded combinatorics as deﬁned

in Section 2.1 then RiIf (g) ∈ W for every i and If (g) ∈ W s(Ωn,p).

ii. If If (g) is inﬁnitely renormalizable with p-bounded combinatorics then the

image of the operator DgIf is dense in T Bnor(U ).

Here W ⊂ Bnor(U ) is the domain of the complexiﬁcation of the renormalization
operator R as deﬁned Section 3. This follows from the complex bounds result in
Proposition 2, the universality result in Proposition 4.6 and an argument similar
to the complexiﬁcation of the renormalization operator in Section 3.

Since Ωn,p is a hyperbolic invariant set of R due Theorem 5 and W s(Ωn,p) has
transversal empty interior due Corollary 9.3 we conclude by Proposition 8.1 of [25]
that for a generic γ ∈ ΓωR
n (BR) the set of parameters λ ∈ [−1, 1]n where If (γ(λ)) is
inﬁnitely renormalizable with p-bounded combinatorics has zero Lebesgue measure.
(cid:3)

Indeed Proposition 8.1 of [25] implies an analogous result for ﬁnitely diﬀerentiable
families of maps in M. We refer the reader to [25] for additional statements and
deﬁnitions for this setting.

11. Compositions of quadratic maps

We can say something about a speciﬁc family of extended maps of type n. This

family was introduced in [22]. Let λ = (λi)i≤n, with λi ∈ [0, 1] and deﬁne

Fλ : C × {i}i≤n → C × {i}i≤n

as Fλ(z, i) = (−2λiz2 + 2λi − 1, i + 1 mod n).

It follows from the study in [22] that each possible combinatorial type of an
inﬁnitely renormalizable extended map of type n with combinatorics bounded by
p can be realized by an unique parameter in [0, 1]n and the set of such parameters
Λp,n ⊂ [0, 1]n is a Cantor set [22, Theorem 2]. The following result answers a
conjecture in [22].

Theorem 7. We have that m(Λp,n) = 0, where m is the n-dimensional Lebesgue
measure.

Proof. Due Corollary 10.2 in [25], it is enough to show that this family is transversal
to the horizontal distribution F → Eh
F . We will give a proof similar to the proof
of the transversality of the quadratic family by Lyubich [14]. Indeed, suppose by
contradiction that there exists λ0 ∈ Λp,n and w ∈ Rn \ {0} such that

v = ∂λFλ|λ=λ0 · w ∈ Eh

Fλ0

.

So there is a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld α0, deﬁned in a neighborhood of the post-
critical set P (Fλ0 ) satisfying (7) on P (Fλ0 ). Since this is a family of polynomials,
the conformal dynamics outside the Julia set of Fλ0 is always the same, so v is also
a vertical direction, that is, there exists a conformal vector ﬁeld α1 deﬁned outside
the Julia set such that (7) holds outside the Julia set. Using the inﬁnitesimal pull-
back argument we can ﬁnd a quasiconformal vector ﬁeld solution α that satisﬁes
(7) everywhere and moreover it is conformal outside the Julia set. Since Fλ0 does
not support invariant line ﬁelds on its Julia set we conclude that α is conformal
everywhere and indeed it is equal to zero, since it is zero at three points of C × {i},
for each i ≤ n. So v = 0, which implies w = 0.
(cid:3)

46

DANIEL SMANIA

Remark 11.1. Note that Λp,n only includes the parameters where each renormal-
ization involves all n critical points, that is, each cycle of intervals covers all critical
points. If we consider inﬁnitely renormalizable maps where fewer points are involved
then the set of parameters it is not a Cantor set anymore. However it is likely that
this larger subset of parameters also have zero Lebesgue measure.
