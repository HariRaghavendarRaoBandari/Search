SUM OF SQUARES LENGTH OF REAL FORMS

CLAUS SCHEIDERER

Abstract. For n, d ≥ 1 let p(n, 2d) denote the smallest number p such that
every sum of squares of forms of degree d in R[x1, . . . , xn] is a sum of p squares.
We establish lower bounds for these numbers that are considerably stronger
than the bounds known so far. Combined with known upper bounds they
give p(3, 2d) ∈ {d + 1, d + 2} in the ternary case. Assuming a conjecture of
Iarrobino-Kanev on dimensions of tangent spaces to catalecticant varieties, we
show that p(n, 2d) ∼ const · d(n−1)/2 for d → ∞ and all n ≥ 3. For ternary
sextics and quaternary quartics we determine the exact value of the invariant,
showing p(3, 6) = 4 and p(4, 4) = 5.

Introduction

Given a polynomial f (x1, . . . , xn) with real coeﬃcients that has nonnegative
values, Artin proved that f can be written as a sum of squares of rational functions
over R. By a famous theorem of Pﬁster [13], 2n squares are always suﬃcient to
represent f . For n ≤ 2 this bound is known to be best possible, whereas for n ≥ 3
it is only known that the best general bound lies between n + 2 and 2n (see [14],
for instance).

In general it is not possible to represent f as a sum of squares of polynomials,
as Hilbert [9] proved in 1888. However if we restrict attention to sums of squares
of polynomials, it is natural to ask for an upper bound on the number of squares
needed. Switching to homogeneous polynomials (forms), we therefore ﬁx n, d ≥ 1
and ask for the smallest number p = p(n, 2d) such that every form of degree 2d
in R[x1, . . . , xn] that is a sum of squares of forms is a sum of p such squares. For
n ≤ 2 or d = 1 this is an elementary question, but otherwise the only case where
p(n, 2d) is known exactly is (n, 2d) = (3, 4), where p(3, 4) = 3 according to Hilbert
[9].

Still quite a bit is known for other combinations (n, 2d). Choi, Lam and Reznick
[5] established both upper and lower bounds for p(n, 2d). Fixing the number n of
variables, they proved in particular that p(n, 2d) = O(d(n−1)/2) for d → ∞. While
the upper bounds from [5] are still largely the best ones known when n ≥ 4, there
exists a substantial improvement for n = 3, due to Leep [11]. Using Cassels-Pﬁster
theory over a univariate polynomial ring, he improved the upper bound for p(3, 2d)
from 2d + 1 to d + 2. On the other hand, there is a huge gap between known
upper and lower bounds. Fixing n and letting d grow, the asymptotically best
lower bounds known for p(n, 2d) are only logarithmic in d [4]. See Section 1 below
for precise details.

The ﬁrst main result of this paper establishes new lower bounds that are much
closer to the existing upper bounds. In fact they have the same growth rate for
d → ∞, showing p(n, 2d) ∼ d(n−1)/2 for d → ∞. For ternary forms, they combine
with Leep’s theorem to show that p(3, 2d) is either d + 1 or d + 2. The idea is
to consider forms f that are sums of squares and vanish in a generic ﬁnite set
Z ⊆ Pn−1(R) of appropriate size. For such f we show that the sum of squares
representation of f is essentially unique. The explicit form of the resulting bound
depends on the assumption that the Hilbert series of the squared vanishing ideal

I(Z)2 is the expected one. For n = 3 this has been proved, but for n ≥ 4 it is merely
a conjecture due to Iarrobino-Kanev. Although the conjecture has been veriﬁed for
small values of n and d, our bounds for n ≥ 4 depend therefore in general on this
conjecture.
The second main result computes the invariants p(3, 6) and p(4, 4) exactly, show-
ing p(3, 6) = 4 and p(4, 4) = 5. Note that (3, 6) and (4, 4) are precisely the two
minimal cases where the sums of squares cone is strictly smaller than the cone of
nonnegative forms.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 recalls the upper and lower bounds
for p(n, 2d) that can be found in the literature. Section 2 studies the collection of
typical sums of squares lengths of forms in Σn,2d, i.e., lengths that occur for an open
nonempty set of forms. We show that every integer between the typical complex
length (essentially known) and the maximum length p(n, 2d) is a typical length in
this sense. Section 3 establishes the new lower bound for p(n, 2d) (depending on the
Iarrobino-Kanev conjecture for n ≥ 4) and discusses the asymptotics of p(n, 2d).
In Section 4 we show that in the cases (3, 6) and (4, 4) the existing lower bound for
p(n, 2d) is sharp.

We remark that the results of this paper remain true over any real closed ﬁeld,

instead of R.

1. Review of known upper and lower bounds

1.1. We start with setting up basic notation. Let n ≥ 1, e ≥ 0, and write
x = (x1, . . . , xn). By R[x]e we denote the space of degree e forms (homogeneous
polynomials) in R[x]. We often abbreviate

Nn,e := dim R[x]e = (cid:18)n + e − 1
n − 1 (cid:19).

If e = 2d is even then Σn,2d denotes the subset of R[x]2d of all forms that are sums
of squares of forms of degree d. It is well known that Σn,2d is a closed convex cone
in R[x]2d with nonempty interior. Given f ∈ Σn,2d, we denote by

the sum of squares length (or sos length) of f . We call

ℓ(f ) = min(cid:8)r ≥ 0 : ∃ p1, . . . , pr ∈ R[x]d with f = p2
p(n, 2d) := sup(cid:8)ℓ(f ) : f ∈ Σn,2d(cid:9)

1 + ··· + p2
r(cid:9)

the Pythagoras number of n-ary forms of degree 2d.

1.2. It is elementary to see p(1, 2d) = 1, p(2, 2d) = 2 (d ≥ 1) and p(n, 2) = n
(n ≥ 1). Clearly, n ≤ m and d ≤ e imply p(n, 2d) ≤ p(m, 2e). Hilbert [9] proved
p(3, 4) = 3. So far, these are the only cases where the precise value of p(n, 2d) is
known.

1.3. For n ≥ 2, Choi, Dai, Lam and Reznick [4] proved in 1982 that the ring
R[x1, . . . , xn] has Pythagoras number ∞. This amounts to p(n, 2d) → ∞ for n ≥ 3
and d → ∞. From the proof of [4] Theorem 4.10 one can extract explicit lower
bounds for p(n, 2d) when n ≥ 3. In particular, it is shown there that p(n, 4d + 2) >
p(n, 2d), resulting in lower bounds for p(n, 2d) that are logarithmic in d.

A systematic study of the invariants p(n, 2d) was initiated by Choi, Lam and
Reznick [5] in 1995. Adopting notation from [5], the following is essentially the
main result:

Theorem 1.4. Let n, d ≥ 1. The Pythagoras number p := p(n, 2d) satisﬁes the
inequalities

Proof. (Sketch) The ﬁrst inequality in (1) comes from the fact that when f =
Pr
is a sum of squares representation of f of minimal length, the products
fifj are linearly independent. The second follows from the fact that the sum of
squares map (R[x]d)p → R[x]2d is submersive generically on the source, according
to Sard’s theorem.

(cid:3)

1.5. The setup of [5] is in fact more general than in Theorem 1.4. The authors
consider sums of squares f whose Newton polytope New(f ) is contained in a ﬁxed
convex set (“cage”) C. Inequalities (2) are generalized (with essentially the same
proof) to

λ(C) ≤ p(C) ≤ Λ(C)

for any cage C, where p(C) = max{ℓ(f ) : f ∈ Σ, New(f ) ⊆ C}, and λ(C), Λ(C)
are deﬁned as in (3), with e resp. a (related to) the numbers of lattice points in 1
2 C
and C. See [5] for precise deﬁnitions.

1.6. Particular choices of C may lead to improved lower bounds for p(n, 2d).
Namely, let λ(n, 2d) = maxC λ(C), maximum over the Newton polytopes C of
forms in R[x1, . . . , xn]2d. Then λ(n, 2d) ≤ p(n, 2d), and it may happen that
⌈λ(n, 2d)⌉ < ⌈λ(n, 2d)⌉. This phenomenon was already discussed in [5], and was
later studied in detail by Leep and Starr [12].
Unfortunately there is a huge discrepancy between lower and upper bounds. The
reason is that the lower bounds λ are quite weak in general, even in the improved
version λ. Indeed, it is easy to see that d 7→ λ(n, 2d) is growing with limit 2n−1
for d → ∞, and it is expected ([12] Conjecture 4.3) that the same holds for λ. For
n = 3 is has been shown that λ(n, 2d) = ⌈λ(n, 2d)⌉ = 4 for all d ≥ 3 ([12] Theorem
4.3). Therefore, when d is large relative to n, then λ (and probably λ as well) only
gives the lower bound 2n−1 for p(n, 2d), which does not even depend on d. This
strongly contrasts with the fact that p(n, 2d) → ∞ for d → ∞, when n ≥ 3. See
also the discussion at the end of [12]. Altogether, when one considers the general
case (d large relative to n ≥ 3), it seems that the strongest known lower bounds for
p(n, 2d) are still the logarithmic bounds derived from [4], see 1.3 above.

g ∈ A[x1, . . . , xr] with l2

1.7. We now discuss a substantial improvement for the upper bound in the case of
ternary forms, due to Leep [11]. To describe his result, let A be a ring containing
1
2 . For r ≥ 1 let gr(A) denote the smallest number g ≥ 1 such that, for any ﬁnite
number l1, . . . , lN of linear forms in A[x1, . . . , xr], there exist g other linear forms
l′
1, . . . , l′
g . If there is no ﬁnite such
bound we write gr(A) = ∞.
for every r ≥ 1 ([2] Example iii).
1.8. Upper bounds on gr can lead to upper bounds for sos lengths, by the following
elementary observation (compare [4] Theorem 2.7). Let B be an A-algebra, and

For example, when R is a real closed ﬁeld and t is a variable, gr(R[t]) = r + 1

let M be an A-submodule of B generated by r < ∞ elements. Let g = gr(A). If
b ∈ B is a sum of squares of elements of M , then there exist b1, . . . , bg ∈ M with
b = b2

1 + ··· + b2
g.

Leep proves ([11] Theorem 5.2):

Theorem 1.9. (Leep) If k is any real ﬁeld then gr(k[t]) = gr(k(t)) for all r ≥ 1.
Corollary 1.10. When R is a real closed ﬁeld then gr(R[t]) = r + 1 for any
r ≥ 1.
(cid:3)

Corollary 1.10 remains true when the ﬁeld R is merely hereditarily pythagorean,

see [11] Theorem 6.3 and thereafter.

1.11. When we speak of zeros of a form f (x1, . . . , xn) we mean zeros in complex pro-
jective space Pn−1(C). Recall that the multiplicity of a form 0 6= f ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn]
at a point ξ ∈ Pn−1(C) is the minimal number m ≥ 0 for which there exists
an n-tuple a = (a1, . . . , an) of nonnegative integers with Pn
i=1 ai = m and with
(∂af )(ξ) = ∂a1
n f (ξ) 6= 0. When f has nonnegative values, the multiplicity
of f at any point in Pn−1(R) is even. The form f is singular if and only if it has
multiplicity ≥ 2 at some ξ ∈ Pn−1(C).

1 ··· ∂an

Applying Corollary 1.10 we get:

Theorem 1.12. Let n ≥ 2 and d ≥ 1, let f ∈ Σn,2d, and assume that f has a real
zero of multiplicity 2m ≥ 0. Then

ℓ(f ) ≤ 1 +(cid:18)n + d − 2

n − 2 (cid:19) −(cid:18)n + m − 3
n − 2 (cid:19).

In particular, m = 0 gives

(4)

for all d ≥ 1.

p(n, 2d) ≤ 1 +(cid:18)n − 2 + d
n − 2 (cid:19)

The most interesting case is when n = 3 (ternary forms):

Corollary 1.13. (Leep) If f ∈ Σ3,2d has a real zero of multiplicity 2m ≥ 0 then
ℓ(f ) ≤ d + 2 − m. In particular, p(3, 2d) ≤ d + 2 for all d ≥ 1.
Proof of Theorem 1.12. Let ξ ∈ Pn−1(R) be a real zero of f of multiplicity 2m ≥ 0.
After a linear change of coordinates we can assume ξ = (0 : ··· : 0 : 1). Then
degxn(f ) = 2(d − m). If f is written as a sum of squares, say f = Pν p2
ν, the pν
contain only monomials xβ with |β| = d and 0 ≤ βn ≤ d − m. Let R[x1, . . . , xn] →
R[x2, . . . , xn], g 7→ g′ := g(1, x2, . . . , xn) be the dehomogenization operator. The p′
lie in the R[x2]-submodule of R[x2, . . . , xn] spanned by the monomials xβ3
3 ··· xβn
with β3 + ··· + βn ≤ d and βn ≤ d − m. The number of these monomials is

Using Remark 1.8 and Corollary 1.10 we conclude ℓ(f ) ≤ N + 1.
Remarks 1.14.
1. Denote the bound from Theorem 1.12 by L(n, 2d) := 1 +(cid:0)n+d−2
n−2 (cid:1). Let us
compare L(n, 2d) with the general upper bound Λ(n, 2d) (Theorem 1.4). When
n = 3 we have L(3, 2d) = d + 2, which is signiﬁcantly better than Λ(3, 2d) = 2d + 1.
For n ≥ 4, however L(n, 2d) is usually weaker (bigger) than Λ(n, 2d). This is clear
since L(n, 2d) is a polynomial of degree n− 2 in d, whereas Λ(n, 2d) = O(d(n−1)/2).

(cid:3)

In fact, there are only three pairs (n, d) with n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 1 where L(n, 2d) <
⌊Λ(n, 2d)⌋. These are

(n, 2d) = (4, 6), (4, 8) and (4, 10),

where ⌊Λ(n, 2d)⌋ = 12, 17, 23 respectively, while L(n, 2d) is smaller by one.

2. As far as we know, the upper bounds p(3, 2d) ≤ d + 2 for d ≥ 2 (1.13), resp.

p(n, 2d) ≤ (L(n, 2d) n = 4 and 3 ≤ d ≤ 5,

Λ(n, 2d) otherwise
for n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 2, are the best ones known to date.

2. Typical sum of squares lengths

Let x = (x1, . . . , xn). We show that the set of typical sos lengths for forms in

R[x]d is determined by p(n, 2d) and by the (unique) typical sos length over C.
2.1. Fix n, d ≥ 1, and work over C ﬁrst. Let t = t(n, 2d) ≥ 1 be the minimal
number for which the set {p2
t : p1, . . . , pt ∈ C[x]d} is (Zariski) dense in
C[x]2d. By Sard’s theorem, this is also the minimal number t of forms p1, . . . , pt of
degree d with hx1, . . . , xni2d ⊆ hp1, . . . , pri, where h···i denotes the ideal generated
in C[x].

1 + ··· + p2

2.2. It is clear that t(2, 2d) = 2 for all d ≥ 1 and t(n, 2) = n for all n ≥ 1,
and that t = t(n, 2d) always satisﬁes tNn,d −(cid:0)t
2(cid:1) ≥ Nn,2d, i.e. t ≥ λ(n, 2d) (see
1.4). A general conjecture due to Fr¨oberg [7] predicts the Hilbert series of an
ideal generated by a generic collection of forms of prescribed degrees. As a very
particular case, this conjecture predicts t(n, 2d) = ⌈λ(n, 2d)⌉ for all (n, d). For all
(n, d), the theorem of Fr¨oberg, Ottaviani and Shapiro [8] implies t(n, 2d) ≤ 2n−1.
In particular we have t(n, 2d) = 2n−1 when ⌈λ(n, 2d)⌉ = 2n−1, which is the case
for d large enough. For smaller d the values of t(n, 2d) may be determined with
the help of a computer algebra system, as long as n is not too big. In this way one
shows that t(3, 2) = t(3, 4) = 3 and t(3, 2d) = 4 for 2d ≥ 6. For n = 4 the values of
t are

t(4, 2d) = 


2.3. Now ﬁx n, d ≥ 1. For r ≥ 1 let

5 if 2 ≤ d ≤ 4,
6 if 5 ≤ d ≤ 8,
7 if 9 ≤ d ≤ 20,
8 if d ≥ 21.

and let

Σn,2d(r) := {f ∈ Σn,2d : ℓ(f ) ≤ r},

T (n, 2d) := nr ≥ 1 : Σn,2d(r) r Σn,2d(r − 1) has nonempty interior in R[x]2do.

T (n, 2d) is the set of typical sos lengths for Σn,2d, i.e., the set of numbers r for
which there exists a non-empty open set consisting of forms of sos length r. Clearly
t(n, 2d) is the smallest element of T (n, 2d).

Proposition 2.4. Let n, d, r ≥ 1, and let mr = dim(I2d) where I is an ideal
generated by a generic sequence of r forms of degree d.

(a) Σn,2d(r) is a closed semi-algebraic subset of R[x]2d.
(b) For every f ∈ Σn,2d(r), the local dimension of Σn,2d(r) at f is mr.
(c) If r ≥ t(n, 2d) then Σn,2d(r) is the closure of its interior.

Proof. Consider the map φ : (R[x]d)r → R[x]2d, (p1, . . . , pr) 7→Pr
i . (a) is clear
since φ is a proper polynomial map. In (b) it is clear that dim Σn,2d(r) ≤ mr. For
all r-tuples p = (p1, . . . , pr) ∈ (R[x]d)r outside a proper real algebraic set we have
dimhp1, . . . , pri2d = mr. For these p, the local dimension of Σn,2d(r) at φ(p) is
equal to mr. Since these p are dense in im(φ) we get (b). For r ≥ t(n, 2d) we have
mr = Nn,2d, so (b) implies (c).

Corollary 2.5. The typical sos lengths for Σn,2d are T (n, 2d) = {t, t + 1, . . . , p}
where t = t(n, 2d) and p = p(n, 2d).

Proof. Write Σ := Σn,2d, and let t ≤ r ≤ p. Then Σ(r − 1) 6= Σ(r), and hence
int Σ(r) 6⊆ Σ(r − 1) since Σ(r) = int Σ(r) (Proposition 2.4). So int(Σ(r)) r Σ(r − 1)
is a non-empty open set of forms of length equal to r.

3. Lower bounds

3.1. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, let V be a vector space over k. For
m ≥ 0 let SmV be the m-th symmetric power of V over k. We will identify SmV
with the subspace of symmetric tensors in the m-fold tensor power V ⊗m, which is
possible since char(k) = 0.

Let A be a k-algebra. The Gram tensor of a given sum of squares representation

i in A (with a1, . . . , am ∈ A) is the symmetric tensor

i=1 a2

f =Pm

ϑ =

ai ⊗ ai ∈ S2A.

Of course we may as well regard ϑ as an element of S2U , for any linear subspace
U ⊆ A containing a1, . . . , am. Two sum of squares representations f =Pm
i =
Pm
i (with ai, bi ∈ A) are (orthogonally) equivalent if there exists an orthogonal
matrix u = (uij)1≤i,j≤m over k (satisfying uut = I) such that bj = Pm
i=1 uijai for
1 ≤ j ≤ m. Clearly, equivalent sum of squares representations have the same Gram
tensor. An elementary but important fact is that the converse holds provided the
ﬁeld k is real (see [5]).

i=1 a2

3.2. If I ⊆ k[x] = k[x1, . . . , xn] is a homogeneous ideal, we write hj(I) = dim k[x]j/Ij
for j ≥ 0. For any set Z ⊆ Pn−1(k), the full (saturated) vanishing ideal of Z is
denoted I(Z).

We ﬁrst discuss ternary forms (case n = 3, x = (x1, x2, x3)), and abbreviate

Σd := Σ3,d.

Proposition 3.3. Let d ≥ 1, and let Z ⊆ P2(R) be a set of |Z| =(cid:0)d+1
2 (cid:1) real points
in suﬃciently general position. Then any f ∈ Σ2d vanishing on Z has a unique
sum of squares representation, up to orthogonal equivalence.
Proof. Let I = I(Z). It is enough to show that the product map µ : S2(Id) → R[x]2d
is injective. Indeed, if f ∈ Σ2d vanishes on Z and f =Pν p2
ν is any sum of squares
representation, then pν ∈ Id for all ν. By the asserted injectivity of µ, the symmetric
Gram tensor Pν pν ⊗ pν is uniquely determined by f , which is the claim (see 3.1).
Since the points in Z are general we have Id−1 = {0} and dim(Id) = (cid:0)d+2
2 (cid:1) −
(cid:0)d+1
2 (cid:1) = d + 1. In particular, the subspace im(µ) = IdId of R[x]2d satisﬁes IdId =
(cid:0)d+2
2 (cid:1), and hence is equivalent to

(I 2)2d. Injectivity of µ means that this space has dimension equal to dim S2(Id) =

h2d(I 2) = (cid:18)2d + 2

2 (cid:19) −(cid:18)d + 2

Equality (5) is known to be true, see Iarrobino-Kanev [10] Prop. 4.8. In fact, the
complete Hilbert series of I 2 is determined there. This proves Proposition 3.3. (cid:3)

Proposition 3.3 has the following consequences:

Corollary 3.4. If Z ⊆ P2(R) is a set of s general points where (cid:0)d+1
2 (cid:1) ≤ s ≤(cid:0)d+2
2 (cid:1),
then any general sum of squares f ∈ Σ2d that vanishes on Z has sos length ℓ(f ) =
(cid:0)d+2
2 (cid:1) − s.
Proof. Since dim I(Z)d =(cid:0)d+2

the form f = p2

(cid:3)

In particular we get a lower bound for the Pythagoras number:

Corollary 3.5. Let d ≥ 2. Any general sum of squares of degree 2d in R[x1, x2, x3]
vanishing in (cid:0)d+1
2 (cid:1) general R-points has sos length d + 1. Therefore p(3, 2d) ≥
d + 1.

(cid:3)

Combined with Corollary 1.13 this gives:

Theorem 3.6. For any d ≥ 2, the Pythagoras number p(3, 2d) is either d + 1 or
d + 2.

(cid:3)

3.7. In principle the same argument extends to the case of n ≥ 4 variables. In
general however, when I is the vanishing ideal of a generic ﬁnite set of points in
Pn−1, the Hilbert function of I 2 is known only conjecturally.
In [10] Sect. 3.2,
Iarrobino-Kanev formulate conjectures about the dimensions of tangent spaces to
catalecticant varieties corresponding to power sums. These conjectures can be
formulated in terms of the Hilbert function of I 2. In particular, if d is the lowest
degree with Id 6= {0}, and if b = dim(Id), it is conjectured that (I 2)2d = IdId
has the maximum possible dimension (cid:0)b+1
2 (cid:1), unless a smaller value is forced by the
Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. Explicitly, this means (we write Nd := Nn,d =
(cid:0)n+d−1
n−1 (cid:1) in the sequel):
Conjecture 3.8. (Iarrobino-Kanev, [10] Conjecture 3.25) Let n ≥ 3, d ≥ 2 and
Nd−1 ≤ s < Nd, and let I = I(Z) be the vanishing ideal of a set Z of s general
points in Pn−1. Then

except for (n, d, s) = (3, 2, 5), (4, 2, 9) and (5, 2, 14), where max has to be replaced
by min.

Of course, the exceptional cases correspond to exceptional cases of the Alexander-
Hirschowitz theorem. Conjecture 3.8 is proved in [10] for n = 3, and also for n ≥ 4
in the case Nd − n ≤ s < Nd. Note that [10] Conjecture 3.25 contains misprints,
but compare with loc. cit., Conjecture 3.20.

Assuming Conjecture 3.8 we can conclude:

Corollary 3.9. Let n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 2, and let s = smin(n, d) be the smallest integer
satisfying (cid:0)Nd−s+1
(cid:1) ≤ N2d − ns. Then Nd−1 < s < Nd. If Conjecture 3.8 is true
for the given values of (n, d, s), then

2

p(n, 2d) ≥ Nd − s.

In fact, then, any generic sum of squares in Σ2d that vanishes in a generic set of s
real points has sos length equal to Nd − s.

Proof. We only sketch the proof of Nd−1 < s < Nd. Check the claim directly for
(n, d) = (4, 2) or (5, 2) and discard these cases. Consider the polynomial

P (x) = x2 − (2Nd − 2n + 1)x + Nd(Nd + 1) − 2N2d.

By deﬁnition, s = smin(n, d) is the smallest integer satisfying P (s) ≤ 0. One shows
that P (Nd − 1) ≤ 0, thereby proving s < Nd. To prove the other inequality, ﬁx n
and consider P (Nd−1) as a polynomial in d. One shows that P (Nd−1) = (d−1)Q(d)
where Q is a polynomial with all coeﬃcients nonnegative. This implies P (Nd−1) >
0, and thus s > Nd−1. The details are left to the reader.

By the argument in the proof of 3.3 we get p(n, 2d) ≥ Nd − t for any number
t such that the map S2Id → R[x]2d is injective, where I is the vanishing ideal of
a generic set of t points in Pn−1(R). Since s = smin(n, d) ≥ Nd−1, Conjecture 3.8
predicts that this property holds for t = s.

Remarks 3.10.

1. In Conjecture 3.8 it is clear that ≥ holds, i.e. that h2d(I 2) is at least the right
hand maximum (resp. minimum in the exceptional cases). For any concrete values
of n, d and s, the conjecture can be veriﬁed by ﬁnding a single concrete set Z with
|Z| = s for which equality holds in 3.8. In this way the conjecture is easily veriﬁed
for suﬃciently small values of n, d, s, using a computer algebra system.

2. An unconditional formulation of Corollary 3.9, not depending on Conjecture
3.8, would be: Let n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 2, let Nd−1 ≤ s < Nd, and let I be the vanishing
ideal of a generic set Z ⊆ Pn−1(R) of s points. If h2d(I 2) = N2d −(cid:0)Nd−s+1
(cid:1), then
p(n, 2d) ≥ Nd − s. The drawback, of course, is that we have no good control of
what numbers s satisfy the condition. Theorem 4.19 in [10] shows that s = Nd − n
is admitted, but this only gives the useless bound p(n, 2d) ≥ n.
Remark 3.11. For small values of n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 2 we record the bounds on p(n, 2d)
that we have obtained. The following table lists the minimal number s = smin(n, d)
and the corresponding lower bound Nd − s for p(n, 2d) from Corollary 3.9. We
compare these with the upper bounds from Section 1. (Those upper bounds are
usually the numbers ⌊Λ(n, 2d)⌋, with only three exceptions where L(n, 2d) is better,
see Remark 1.14.)

Remark 3.12. The forms in Σn,2d of large sos length that were constructed in
Corollaries 3.5 and 3.9 are of very special nature, in that they have many real
zeros. Corollary 2.5 on typical lengths shows that there exists a nonempty open set
of nonsingular forms with the same sos length.
Theorem 3.13. Let n ≥ 4. Assuming Conjecture 3.8, the Pythagoras number
p(n, 2d) grows asymptotically like d(n−1)/2 for d → ∞. More precisely, for any
ε > 0 the inequalities

(cn − ε) d(n−1)/2 < p(n, 2d) < (Cn + ε) d(n−1)/2

.

Proof. Let ϑ(n, 2d) := Nd − smin(n, d), see 3.9. For all d ≥ 2 we have ϑ(n, 2d) ≤
p(n, 2d) ≤ Λ(n, 2d). Since N2d = 1

(n−1)! (2d + 1)··· (2d + n − 1), it is clear that

Λ(n, 2d) ∼ p2N2d ∼ s 2

(n − 1)!

(2d)n−1 = Cnd(n−1)/2

for d → ∞ (meaning that the quotient of both sides converges to 1). On the
other hand, ϑ = ϑ(n, 2d) is the largest integer 0 < ϑ < Nd satisfying (cid:0)ϑ+1
2 (cid:1) ≤
N2d − n(Nd − ϑ). This means

and since

N2d − nNd =

(n − 1)!(cid:16)(2d + 1)··· (2d + n − 1) − n(d + 1)··· (d + n − 1)(cid:17)

we get ϑ(n, 2d) ∼ cnd(n−1)/2.
Remark 3.14. A diﬀerent view on the asymptotic behaviour of p(n, 2d) is taken in
[5] Theorem 6.4. Fixing the degree, it is shown there that γ1 nd ≤ p(n, 2d) ≤ γ2 nd
for all n ≥ 1 and suitable γ1, γ2 > 0 depending on d. This result only uses the
weak lower bound λ(n, 2d).

4. Ternary sextics and quaternary quartics

We now prove that the lower bounds for the Pythagoras number from Section 3

are sharp, in the case of ternary sextics or quaternary quartics:

Theorem 4.1. p(3, 6) = 4: Every ternary sextic that is a sum of squares is a sum
of four squares.

Theorem 4.2. p(4, 4) = 5: Every quaternary quartic that is a sum of squares is a
sum of ﬁve squares.

Corollary 4.3. The elements of length 4 in Σ3,6, or those of length 5 in Σ4,4, form
an open dense subset.

Proof. The set of three squares in Σ3,6 (resp. of four squares in Σ4,4) is nowhere
dense since λ(3, 6) = 4 (resp. λ(4, 4) = 5). So the claims follow from 4.1 resp.
4.2.
(cid:3)

The proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 are similar. We do the (3, 6) case ﬁrst, and
then explain how to modify the argument in the (4, 4) case. See Remark 4.8 below
for comments on the proofs.

4.4. In the following let k be a ﬁeld, char(k) = 0. Write A = k[x] = k[x1, . . . , xn] =
Le≥0 Ae. Given e ≥ 1 and 0 6= α ∈ A∨
e = Hom(Ae, k), let I(α) ⊆ A be the graded
ideal deﬁned by I(α)i = {p ∈ Ai : pAe−i ⊆ ker(α)} (0 ≤ i ≤ e) and I(α)i = Ai for
i > e. Then the graded artinian ring R = A/I(α) is Gorenstein with socle degree e.
In particular, this means that α induces a linear duality between Ri and Re−i for
0 ≤ i ≤ e.

The following is the key observation in the (3, 6) case:

10

Proposition 4.5. Let p1, . . . , pr ∈ k[x1, x2, x3] be linearly independent cubic forms
such that hx1, x2, x3i6 6⊆ hp1, . . . , pri. If r 6= 3 then p1, . . . , pr have a common zero
(in k). In particular, then, the form p2

r is singular.

1 + ··· + p2

Proof. Write x = (x1, x2, x3), let U ⊆ k[x]3 be the linear span of p1, . . . , pr. By
assumption there exists a linear functional 0 6= α ∈ (k[x]6)∨ with U k[x]3 ⊆ ker(α).
Let I = I(α) ⊆ k[x] be the Gorenstein ideal deﬁned by α. Then U ⊆ I3. It is
enough to assume that p1, . . . , pr have no common zero and to show r ≤ 3. By the
assumption there exist three forms q1, q2, q3 ∈ U without common zero. Hence the
ideal J := hq1, q2, q3i is a complete intersection, so J is an artinian Gorenstein ideal
with socle degree 6 (see [6] Theorem CB8). By construction we have J ⊆ I. On the
other hand, both I and J are Gorenstein ideals with same socle degree. Therefore
J = I, and in particular, I3 = J3 has dimension 3, whence r ≤ 3.
(cid:3)
4.6. We now give the proof of Theorem 4.1. Let Σ = Σ3,6, and let Σ(4) ⊆ Σ be
the set of sums of four squares. The map

4

φ : (R[x]3)4 → R[x]6, φ(p1, p2, p3, p4) =

i

Xi=1

is proper, and its image set Σ(4) has nonempty interior in R[x]6. Let Z ⊆ Σ(4)
be the set of critical values of φ. So Z consists of all forms φ(p) where p =
(p1, p2, p3, p4) ∈ (R[x]3)4 is such that hp1, p2, p3, p4i6 6= R[x]6. The set Z is closed
and semi-algebraic in R[x]6 and has empty interior, e.g. by Sard’s theorem. When-
ever [0, 1] → R[x]6, t 7→ ft is a smooth path in R[x]6 with ft ∈ int(Σ) and ft /∈ Z
for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, then f0 ∈ Σ(4) implies f1 ∈ Σ(4), since one can lift the path
t 7→ ft to a path in (R[x]3)4.
Since λ(3, 6) = 4, it is clear that p(3, 6) ≥ 4. We assume p(3, 6) ≥ 5 and will
arrive at a contradiction. By assumption the semi-algebraic set Z ′ := int(Σ)∩Σ(4)∩
(Σ r Σ(4)) is non-empty. It is contained in Z and has codimension one in R[x]6,
by the above path argument and since the complement of a codimension two set in
int(Σ) is connected. So there exists f ∈ Z ′, together with an open neighborhood
W of f contained in Σ, such that Z ′ ∩ W is a smooth codimension one submanifold
of W . Since every singular form in int(Σ) has at least two distinct singularities
(complex conjugate), the set {f ∈ int(Σ) : f is singular} has codimension two.
Therefore we can choose f to be nonsingular. Then it follows from Proposition 4.5
that f is a sum of three squares.

Let 0 6= α ∈ (R[x]6)∨ such that {g ∈ R[x]6 : α(g−f ) = 0} is the aﬃne hyperplane
in R[x]6 tangent to Z ′ at f .
If we shrink W appropriately, the hypersurface Z ′
divides W into two open halves, one contained in Σ(4), the other contained in
Σ r Σ(4). Replacing α with −α if necessary, we can thus assume: If h ∈ R[x]6
satisﬁes α(h) > 0, then ℓ(f + th) ≤ 4 and ℓ(f − th) ≥ 5, for all suﬃciently small
t > 0.
It follows that α(f ) = 0. Since f ∈ int(Σ), there exists p ∈ R[x]3 with
α(p2) < 0. By the choice of α we have ℓ(f + tp2) ≥ 5 for small t > 0. But this is a
contradiction since ℓ(f ) ≤ 3. Theorem 4.1 is proved.

In the (4, 4) case, the analogue to Proposition 4.5 is

Proposition 4.7. Let p1, . . . , pr ∈ k[x1, x2, x3, x4] be linearly independent qua-
dratic forms such that hx1, x2, x3, x4i4 6⊆ hp1, . . . , pri. If r 6= 4 then p1, . . . , pr have
a common zero. In particular, then, the form p2

r is singular.

1 + ··· + p2

The proof is completely parallel to the proof of 4.5. The essential point is that
four quadratic forms in k[x] = k[x1, . . . , x4] without common zero deﬁne a complete
intersection with socle degree 4. Having proved 4.7, one considers the sum of squares

SUM OF SQUARES LENGTH OF REAL FORMS

map φ : (R[x]2)5 → R[x]4 and proceeds similarly to 4.6, thereby proving Theorem
4.2.

Remark 4.8. The proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 have much in common with
Hilbert’s argument for showing that every nonnegative ternary quartic is a sum of
three squares [9]. Hilbert considered the sum of squares map φ : (R[x]2)3 → R[x]4
(x = (x1, x2, x3)) and showed that the critical values of φ are singular forms. Hence
the strictly positive ones among them form a codimension two subset of R[x]4.
This implies that the set of strictly positive forms that are not critical values of φ
is connected, leading to the desired conclusion.

To prove 4.1, say, we have shown that the critical values of (R[x]3)4 → R[x]6 are
singular or else sums of three squares. We then needed an extra argument to deal
with the second case.

Remark 4.9. Blekherman proved that every positive deﬁnite form in the boundary
∂(Σ3,6) (resp. in ∂(Σ4,4)) is a sum of three (resp. four) squares ([3], Corollaries
1.3 and 1.4). Propositions 4.5 and 4.7 give a quick way of reproving these results.
We explain this for (n, d) = (4, 4). Let B be the set of positive deﬁnite forms in
∂(Σ4,4). Every singular form in B has at least two diﬀerent singularities (complex
conjugate), so these forms constitute a subset of codimension ≥ 2 in R[x]4. Since
the semi-algebraic set B has codimension one in R[x]4 locally at each of its points,
every form in B is a limit of nonsingular forms in B. Every nonsingular form in B
is a sum of four squares by 4.7. Since the sums of four squares form a closed set, it
follows that B consists of sums of four squares.

Remark 4.10. Unfortunately, Propositions 4.5 and 4.7 do not directly extend to
higher degrees. Still we conjecture in the ternary case that the lower bound 3.5 is
sharp, i.e. that p(3, 2d) = d + 1 holds for all d ≥ 2.
