Abstract

We consider two cases of the asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat Yamabe problem on a
non-compact manifold with boundary, in dimension n ≥ 3. First, following argu-
ments of Cantor and Brill in the compact case, we show that given an asymptotically
ﬂat metric g, there is a conformally equivalent asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat metric
that agrees with g on the boundary. We then replace the metric boundary condition
with a condition on the mean curvature: Given a function f on the boundary that is
not too large, we show that there is an asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat metric, confor-
mally equivalent to g whose boundary mean curvature is given by f . The latter case
involves solving an elliptic PDE with critical exponent using the method of sub- and
supersolutions. Both results require the usual assumption that the Sobolev quotient
is positive.

1 Introduction

The Yamabe problem, asked in its original form, for which compact Riemannian man-
ifolds (M, g) does there exist a metric conformal to g with constant scalar curvature
[18, 19]. Since the problem was ﬁrst posed, it has branched out into several related
problems; prescribed scalar curvature [12], the case where M has a boundary [10], or is
non-compact [8], non-compact with boundary [16], constant mean curvature boundary
[9], prescription of boundary mean curvature [11], and others (see [5, 13] and references
therein).

The non-compact case seems to have only recently been receiving an amount of
attention due to its relation to the Einstein constraint equations in general relativity.
The Yamabe problem on non-compact manifolds is intimately connected to the con-
formal method of solving the constraint equations (see, for example, [4, 14]); in the

time-symmetric case, the constraint equations simply reduce to the prescribed scalar
curvature equation. Indeed, we are also motivated to study the Yamabe problem on
an asymptotically ﬂat manifold with boundary due to this connection to the constraint
equations; however, rather than seeking to parametrise the space of solutions, we are
motivated by the problem of quasilocal mass (see [17] for an in-depth review of the
problem). Bartnik’s quasilocal mass gives the mass of a bounded region as the inﬁmum
of the ADM mass, over a space of admissible asymptotically ﬂat extensions to the given
region [3]. It is expected that this inﬁmum will be achieved by a static metric that is
continuous across the boundary and induces the same mean curvature of the boundary,
although it is not expected that this solution will be differentiable across the boundary.
For this reason, one is interested in ﬁnding scalar-ﬂat asymptotically ﬂat solutions with
boundary, such that the metric and mean curvature are both ﬁxed on the boundary. In
the literature, this boundary data is often called Bartnik data, or Bartnik’s geometric
boundary data.

Unfortunately, the Yamabe problem with both of these boundary conditions imposed
is overdetermined, so we cannot expect to use this method to ﬁnd vacuum solutions
with prescribed Bartnik boundary data. However, it does motivate the following two
results. We demonstrate the existence of scalar-ﬂat metrics in a ﬁxed conformal class
satisfying either of these boundary conditions separately, but not both simultaneously.
In the following two Propositions, we assume (M, g) is an asymptotically ﬂat manifold
with boundary and positive Sobolev quotient.

Proposition (See Corollary 3.4 for formal statement). There exists an asymptotically ﬂat
scalar-ﬂat metric on M, conformal to g and agreeing with g on ∂M.
Proposition (See Corollary 4.3 for formal statement). There is a positive function ρ on ∂M,
such that for any function f < ρ on ∂M, there exists an asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat metric on
M, conformal to g, such that f is the mean curvature of the boundary with respect to the outer
unit normal.

We prove the ﬁrst of these results following an argument of Cantor and Brill [8],
where they prove the analogous result in the compact case. The second of these results
uses the method of sub- and supersolutions, and relies heavily on excellent previous
work of Maxwell where asymptotically ﬂat solutions to the Einstein constraint equations
with apparent horizon boundary conditions are constructed [14]. This second result is
also related to previous work by Schwartz [16], which considered the scalar-ﬂat Yamabe
problem outside of a ball, however no assumptions about asymptotic ﬂatness are made
in this case considered by Schwartz.

2 The setup

Throughout, we use the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces to control the asymp-
totics. In this Section we recall some properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator between
these weighted spaces on an asymptotically ﬂat manifold with boundary. Let M be a
smooth manifold with boundary such that M minus a compact set K containing the
boundary ∂M, is diffeomorphic to Rn minus a closed ball. Denote this diffeomorphism
by φ : M \ K → Rn \ B1(0). On M, we ﬁx some smooth background metric ˚g that
(δ), the pullback of the Euclidean metric, on M \ K. We also ﬁx a smooth
agrees with φ
function r(x) on M such that r(x) ≥ 1 and r(x) = |φ(x)| on M \ K. We now recall the
weighted Lebesgue and Sobolev norms:

then u = o(rδ). Denote by Wk,p

where ◦ refers to quantities deﬁned by ˚g. The spaces Lp
δ (M) are deﬁned
as the completion of the smooth functions with bounded support on M with respect to
these norms, respectively. We follow the convention of [2], where δ explicitly indicates
the asymptotics; that is, if u ∈ Wk,p
δ (M), the completion
of the compactly supported functions on M \ ∂M with respect to the Wk,p
δ norm. That is,
δ (M) is a space of functions that vanish on the the boundary in the trace sense, along
Wk,p
with their ﬁrst k − 1 derivatives. We will generally omit reference to M, and simply
for the sake of presentation. We say that (M, g) is an asymptotically ﬂat
write Wk,p
manifold if (g− ˚g) ∈ Wk,2
5/2−n with k > n/2, which ensures g is Hölder continuous via the
Sobolev-Morrey embedding. It is well-known that the usual Sobolev-type inequalities
have weighted analogues, which we use throughout – the reader is referred to Theorem
1.2 of [2] for an explicit statement of many of these inequalities.
It is also well-known that the Laplace-Beltrami operator is an isomorphism between
these weighted spaces in the case where M has no boundary. This is also true in the
case considered here, when Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed. In particular,
we make use of the following results (cf. [15]).

Lemma 2.1. Let M be an asymptotically ﬂat manifold with a compact interior boundary. For
any δ ∈ (2 − n, 0) and u ∈ W2,2

δ , we have

δ ∩ W1,2

(cid:107)u(cid:107)2,2,δ ≤ C(cid:107)∆gu(cid:107)2,δ−2.

Furthermore, for any δ ∈ R and u ∈ W2,2
(cid:107)u(cid:107)2,2,δ ≤ C

(2.4)

Proposition 2.2. For any δ ∈ (2 − n, 0), ∆g : W1,2

δ ∩ W2,2

δ → L2

δ−2 is an isomorphism.

We now use Lemma 2.1 to establish the following straightforward corollary.

Corollary 2.3. Assume δ ∈ (2 − n, 0) and f ∈ Ln−2−, with  > 0, then the operator
L = ∆g + f : W1,2
Proof. Making use of (2.3), and the weighted Hölder, Sobolev and interpolation inequali-
ties, we have

δ−2 has ﬁnite dimensional kernel and closed range.

δ ∩ W2,2

δ → L2

(cid:107)u(cid:107)2,2,δ ≤ C(cid:107)Lu(cid:107)2,δ−2 + (cid:107) f u(cid:107)2,δ−2

≤ C((cid:107)Lu(cid:107)2,δ−2 + (cid:107) f(cid:107)n,−2−(cid:107)u(cid:107)2n/(n−2),δ+)

(2.5)

It then follows by a standard argument (see, for example, the proof of Theorem 1.10
in [2]) that L has ﬁnite dimensional kernel and closed range. Let ui be a sequence in
ker(L) satisfying (cid:107)u(cid:107)2,2,δ ≤ 1; that is, a sequence in the closed unit ball in ker(L). By
the weighted Rellich compactness theorem, and passing to a subsequence, we have
ui → u in L2
δ+. Then by the estimate above, we conclude ui also converges in W2,2
,
and it follows that ker(L) is ﬁnite dimensional. It follows that the domain splits as
δ = ker(L) ⊕ K, where K is some closed complementary subspace. To prove
δ ∩ W2,2
W1,2
that ran(L) is closed, we require the following estimate for all u ∈ K,

δ

(cid:107)u(cid:107)2,2,δ ≤ C(cid:107)Lu(cid:107)2,δ−2,

(2.6)

which we prove by contradiction. If (2.6) were not true, there must exist a sequence ui
satisfying (cid:107)ui(cid:107)2,2,δ = 1 while (cid:107)Lui(cid:107)2,δ−2 → 0. But again, (2.5) and the weighted Rellich
compactness theorem imply ui → u in W2,2
, passing to a subsequence if necessary.
Since K is closed, we have u ∈ K, and therefore u is a nonzero element of both K and
ker(L), which is a contradiction. It follows that (2.6) holds, and therefore for any Cauchy
sequence in the range vi = Lui, ui is also Cauchy and therefore converges in W2,2
. By
continuity, vi converges and therefore ran(L) is closed.

our purposes here.

3 Dirichlet boundary conditions

We are now ready to discuss the asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat Yamabe problem, with
Dirichlet boundary conditions on the metric. Given some ﬁxed metric g, consider
conformally related metrics of the form ˜g = φ4/(n−2)g. The problem of prescribing scalar
curvature ˜R := R( ˜g) = f is equivalent to solving

∆gφ − Rφ + φ(n+2)/(n−2) f = 0

The Yamabe problem is historically concerned with the case where f is constant, and the
case of particular interest here is the case where ˜R = f ≡ 0. Recall, asymptotically ﬂat
scalar-ﬂat 3-manifolds correspond to initial data for the vacuum Einstein equations. Note
that this case is signiﬁcantly simpler than the general case as it removes the problem of
the critical Sobolev exponent. The system under consideration in this Section is

where g is assumed to be asymptotically ﬂat. The argument we use here follows that
of Cantor and Brill [8] in the case where no boundary is present. It has been noted by
Maxwell [14] that the Cantor-Brill proof has a minor error, so we are careful avoid this
error here.

conclude u ≡ 0 and therefore Aλ is an injection.

We next make use of the following well-known lemma (cf. [7, 8]).

Lemma 3.2. Let E, F be Banach spaces and suppose for λ ∈ [0, 1], Lλ : E → F is a continuous
family of bounded linear operators. If L0 is an isomorphism and each Lλ is an injection with
closed range, then each Lλ is in fact an isomorphism.

From this, we establish:

Proposition 3.3. Assume (g − ˚g) ∈ Hk

there exists φ with (φ − 1) ∈ H2
Proof. By assumption, R ∈ Ln
1/2−n, so Aλ is an injection and by Corollary 2.3, it has
closed range; that is, by Lemma 3.2 we have that A1, in particular, is an isomorphism.

Since A1 is an isomorphism, we have a unique solution v ∈ (H2
more, standard elliptic theory implies that v is C1,α.
It remains to be shown that φ is positive, which follows identically from the Cantor-
Brill argument, and essentially is as follows. For each λ ∈ [0, 1], there exists a unique φλ
with (φλ − 1) ∈ (H2
loc ) such that Aλφλ = 0. Furthermore, φλ depends
continuously on λ in the C0 topology. Since φ0 ≡ 1, if there is any φλ that is not strictly
(x0) = 0, which
positive, then there must be a φλ0
then implies ∇φλ0
(x0) = 0. However, a classical result (Theorem A of [1]) says that if
u1 ≤ u2 satisfy Aλ0u1 = 0 = Aλ0u2 on some region G, and there is a point x0 ∈ G such
that u1(x0) = u2(x0) and ∇u1(x0) = ∇u2(x0), then u1 = u2 on G (cf. [6], Theorem 1.7
and the proof of Theorem 2.3). That is, φλ0 ≡ 0, which is a contradiction and it therefore
follows that φ > 0.

From which we have the following immediate Corollary.

Corollary 3.4. Assume (g − ˚g) ∈ Hk
exists an asymptotically ﬂat scalat-ﬂat metric, conformal to g, that agrees with g on ∂M.
Remark 3.5. The assumption k > n + 2 is certainly not sharp here, however this allow us to
avoid complications by simply quoting standard elliptic theory.

5/2−n for some k > n + 2, and Q(M, g) > 0, then there

4 Prescribed boundary mean curvature
In this Section, we give conditions under which a function on ∂M can be realised as
the mean curvature an asymptotically ﬂat scalar-ﬂat metric in a prescribed conformal
class. While the scalar curvature transforms according to (3.1) under a conformal
transformation ˜g = u4/(n−2)g, the mean curvature of ∂M transforms according to

where η is the outward unit normal, pointing away from inﬁnity, and H is the mean
curvature with respect to η. This problem can be simpliﬁed greatly by recalling work
of Maxwell [14] where asymptotically ﬂat solutions to the Einstein constraints with
apparent horizon boundary conditions are constructed. In particular, it is shown that
the positivity of the Yamabe constant is a sufﬁcient and necessary condition to ensure
the existence of a scalar-ﬂat, asymptotically ﬂat metric with minimal surface boundary

with boundary mean curvature given by some f , then reduces to the following:

into f , and consider the more general problem

for any β ∈ R.

The method of sub- and supersolutions has been particularly fruitful in considering
the Yamabe problem on non-compact domains [14, 16], and it once again ﬁnds use here.
The particular theorem regarding sub- and supersolutions that we use here is again due
to Maxwell; we state a special case of this result below, which sufﬁces for our purposes.
Proposition 4.1 (Proposition 2 of [14]). Suppose g ∈ Wk,p

Further suppose that f ∈ Wk−1− 1

while supersolution refers to the case where the inequalities are reversed.

We establish the following.

Proposition 4.2. Let (M, g) be an asymptotically ﬂat manifold, where g ∈ Hk
5/2−n with k > n,
and let f ∈ Hk− 3
2 (∂M) satisfy f ≤ 0. Then the problem (4.3) has a solution. Furthermore, if
β > 1 then there exists a positive function, ρ, on ∂M such that the problem (4.3) has a solution
for any f < ρ.
Proof. It follows from Proposition 2.2 that there exists v satisfying ∆gv = 0, that is
δ for all δ ∈ (2 − n, 0). Standard elliptic
identically equal to 1 on ∂M, and v ∈ H2
theory again implies v is C1,α and furthermore, note that we have v = O(r2−n). By the
maximum principle and the Hopf lemma, 0 < v ≤ 1 on M and 0 < ∂v
∂η on ∂M. We now

To ﬁnd a supersolution, we let u+ be of the same form as u− above, however we will
choose a different α. It is clear from (4.4) that we have a supersolution if there exists an α

From this, we have the following immediate corollary.

asymptotically ﬂat metric ˜g, conformal to g, whose boundary mean curvature is f .
