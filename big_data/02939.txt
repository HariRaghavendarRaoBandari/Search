Abstract

In the context of class S theories and 4D/2D duality relations there, we discuss the
skein relations of general topological defects on the 2D side which are expected to be
counterparts of composite surface-line operators in 4D class S theory. Such defects are
geometrically interpreted as networks in a three dimensional space. We also propose a
conjectural computational procedure for such defects in two dimensional SU (N ) topolog-
ical q-deformed Yang-Mills theory by interpreting it as a statistical mechanical system
associated with ideal triangulations.

Introduction

Recently, many interacting superconformal ﬁeld theories (SCFTs) have been discovered
whose deﬁnitions based on lagrangians are not known yet. In particular, there is a certain
group of 4D theories often called “class S theory” which is obtained as twisted compactiﬁ-
cations of the 6d N =(2, 0) SCFTs on Riemann surfaces C with punctures [1–3]. Interest-
ingly, even though almost all of the SCFTs have no deﬁnition based on the lagrangians,
some of their BPS observables have been evaluated assuming the dualities following their
geometrical constructions. In particular, for theories with N =2 lagrangian descriptions,
their partition functions on the squashed four-sphere S4
b [4, 5] and the superconformal in-
dices (SCIs) [6] (in the Schur limit) or equivalently partition functions on S1×q S3 [7] were
computed. Based on their explicit expressions, it was recently suggested that many class S
theories beyond the lagrangian deﬁnition 1 have alternative eﬀective descriptions by some
2D theories : Liouville/Toda CFTs for S4
b case [13, 14] and 2D topological q-deformed
Yang-Mills for S1 ×q S3 case [15–17]. Indeed, in addition to the partition functions, these
4D/2D dualities also oﬀer new geometrical descriptions of supersymmetric defects in such
SCFTs, which are main subjects of this paper.

First, let us focus on the 4D gauge theory. In particular, there are supersymmetric
Wilson-’t Hooft line operators [18–26] and half-BPS surface operators [27–33]. It is con-
sidered that both defects come from codimension-four defects appearing in 6D N =(2, 0)
SCFTs 2 and both have the same origin in 6D. But their appearances in those 2D theories
on C look totally diﬀerent. The 4D line operators correspond to Verlinde network opera-
tors/Wilson network operators in the Liouville-Toda CFTs/q-deformed Yang-Mills theo-
ries, see [35–38] for the geometrical viewpoint, [39–45] for the Verlinde network and [46–51]
for the Wilson network. However, there is a serious problem left : How can we compute
the expectation values of general network defects in the 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills theories
? 3 Naively speaking, it seems to be enough to replace ordinary Lie groups by “quantum
group” as gauge groups at mathematical level. Indeed, the rigorous deﬁnition of Wilson
loops without junctions in that case was given in [49] based on quantum groups, but its
extension to any networks is not obvious yet for several reasons. Furthermore, even if it
can be well-deﬁned, it is not useful for the actual computations because it needs the gen-
eral invariant tensors in the quantum group sense. Instead of giving rigorous deﬁnitions,
we will propose the direct procedure to obtain the conjectural expressions in Sec. 2. Note
that the most important evidence for this proposal is the reproduction of several skein
relations as remarked later.

On the other hand, the 4D surface operators are mapped into (fully degenerate) vertex
operators/diﬀerence operators in the CFTs/Yang-Mills theories, see [40, 44, 52] and [32,

1In this paper, we focus on the Riemann surface compactiﬁcations with more than two regular punc-
tures and no irregular ones. There are generalized proposals for non-SCFTs and Argyres-Douglas theories
which needs such irregular punctures [8–12].

2Precisely speaking, some surface operators can also come from codimension-two defects in the 6D

theory [34]. However, we do not pay attentions to them in this paper.

53–57]. Geometrically, they can be represented as special punctures on the Riemann
surface in both the set-ups. Here let us consider a situation in which both line operators
and surface operators coexist [58]. This is the main subject in this paper.

There arise two questions : 1. Can we describe their skein relations on the geometrical
side ? ˙2. How can we extend the previous conjectural formula for closed Wilson network
defects to these more general cases ? A key observation to answer these questions is
as follows. The existence of crossings among several networks suggests that there is a
hidden direction which is exactly identiﬁed with one of physical directions on the 4D
4 Namely, there appears a three dimensional geometry. This is
gauge theory side.
the more familiar story in RCFTs whose conformal block is the wave function of the
corresponding 3D Chern-Simon theory [59,60]. See also [61] as for Verlinde loop operators
in the Liouville CFT. We must note that the similar story exists for q-deformed Yang-
Mills theory [50,62,63] but the physical origin seems to be diﬀerent. When we recall that
the expectation value of BPS loops are independent of the positions on that direction
[5, 25, 26, 64], it is natural to speculate that the networks are still topological in the new
geometry. In this new three dimensional geometry, codimension four defects are expressed
as knot with junctions and both surface defects and line defects are on the same ground.
We refer the corresponding defects in the q-deformed Yang-Mills theory to as “punctured
networks”, which is the central subject in Sec. 3.

In Sec. 4, we combine the two results in previous two sections and give the expec-
tation values formula for general punctured networks. In the Appendix. A, we develop
the method to evaluate the proposed formula in Sec. 2 and summarize some mathematics
appearing there. Using them, we prove that our proposal indeed satisﬁes a few funda-
mental skein relations in the following Appendix. B. This check gives a strong evidence
that our proposal of the formula works well. The Appendix. C is the complement of
charge/network correspondence discussed in [51].

2 Closed Wilson network defects in 2D q-deformed

Yang-Mills

In this section, we see how the expectation value of any closed Wilson network defects can
be evaluated. Here “closed” means that the networks do not touch on general punctures
coming from codimension two defects in 6D SCFTs not codimension four ones. We divide
the evaluation procedure into two steps : giving the computational procedures for special
cases (See 2.3) and then constructing the general cases using them (See 2.1). However,
we will explain these two steps in the reversed order by starting the general cases and
then by decomposing them into several special building blocks for which we will give the
procedure.

4If we replace the 4-manifold on which the gauge theory is deﬁned by the squashed 4-sphere S4

b , there
are locally two such directions which are exchanged under the ﬂip from b to b−1 [5]. Here we focus on
either direction.

The organization of this section is as follows.

In Sec. 2.1, we show the procedure
to obtain the special building blocks from the general set-ups. Next, in Sec. 2.2, we
review the necessary properties of 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills theory and class S theories.
In Sec. 2.3, we go back to the evaluation of defect expectation values. There, we map
such evaluations for special building blocks into a statistical mechanical system. The
construction of such a mapping and giving the Boltzmann factor are the main points. We
see some applications to a few concrete theories in Sec. 2.4 and make a few comment on
the above mapping of R-matrix in a special case in Sec. 2.5.

First of all, we recall some notations and properties needed in this paper. See also
App. A as for the Lie algebra notation. We assume the following properties for closed
networks (See [36, 45] and [51] for the details.) :

1. Each network consists of trivalent junctions and arrowed edges with a charge a ∈
{0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1} (cid:39) ZN on each. Each charge corresponds to the fundamental
representations ∧a(cid:3) of SU (N ) which form the minimal set to generate all the irre-
ducible representation. Note also that edges with 0 can be removed and we ignore
them hereafter.

Flipping arrow is equivalent to the replacement by the charge conjugate represen-
tation

R = R∗

(2.1)
In particular, as we only consider the fundamental representations ∧a(cid:3), this oper-
ation corresponds to a → N − a.
If we use an edge labelled by an irreducible representation R, we interpret it as a
bunch of edges according to a polynomial expression of R of SU (N ) representation
ring generators of ∧a(cid:3).

.

2. There is the charge conservation on each junction. More precisely, if we have all
three inﬂowing/outgoing edges with charges a, b and c, they must satisfy a+b+c = 0
mod N . On forgetting to take the N -modulo operation, there are two possibilities
: a + b + c = N or 2N . We call the former one (a, b, c)-junction for both inﬂowing
one and outﬂowing one, see Fig. 1. If a + b + c = 2N , the redeﬁnition a(cid:48) = N − a,
b(cid:48) = N − b and c(cid:48) = N − c makes a(cid:48) + b(cid:48) + c(cid:48) = N and the exchange between inﬂowing
and outﬂowing, and we have (N − a, N − b, N − c)-junction for the latter case.

3. Any crossing can be resolved into a network without any crossing. In particular,
in [51], we identiﬁed such relations in class S theories, referred to as “crossing

where s = min(a, b, N − a, N − b) and a, b = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. On the right hand
side, there are no crossings. Therefore, we can remove all the crossings from the
network by applying the above relation to each but have a sum of several networks
instead.

2.1 Reduction onto special cases

Here we see how the most general pairs of the Riemann surface and defects on it decompose
into the several special ones as the building blocks.

Let C be a Riemann surface with genus g and n punctures and Γ be any closed networks
on it. To each puncture, we assign a holonomy which corresponds to the fugacity in the
SCI language. On the types of punctures and its holonomies, see the review in Sec. 2.2
later. Γ may consist of several disconnected components and we write the decomposition
as Γ = (cid:116)
ˇΓα. Next, consider a neighborhood of ˇΓα which is sometimes called a ribbon
graph or a fat graph. This fat graph denoted by ˇCα is a two dimensional open surface and

α

5 There is an important caution. As explained in [51], there are two diﬀerent conventions called
“Liouville-Toda” convention and “q-deformed Yang-Mills” one. Although we focus on the 2D q-deformed
Yang-Mills theory, we also use the former convention which is mostly used in the context of the 4D/2D
duality. There, instead of q, we use another symbol q which is related to q by q = q1/2. Note also that
the skein relations in the q-deformed Yang-Mills convention are obtained under the replacement of q by
−q1/2, where the addition minus sign appears compared to the above actual relation. This is because
the normalizations of the junctions diﬀer in two conventions.

5

ΓCits boundary consists of several copies of S1. See Fig. 2. Cutting along the boundaries
of ˇCα, we have a decomposition of C. By the above construction, in addition to ˇCα’s,

there are other connected components denoting (cid:101)CA which have no defects. Note that we

identify each boundary isomorphic to S1 with a puncture.

Let us make one comment on the topological property of ˇC.

If ˇΓ has 2(cid:96) ((cid:96) > 0)
junctions and the boundary of its fat graph ˇC is isomorphic to k copies of S1, ˇC is the
k-punctured genus ((cid:96) − k)/2 + 1 Riemann surface. Note that its Euler character is −(cid:96). 6
In particular, when ˇΓ is a pure loop without junctions, ˇC is the twice-punctured sphere.
Now C consists of two types of connected components : ˇCα which is homotopic to ˇΓα

and (cid:101)C for which we already know how to compute their partition functions as remarked

later. Since we can reconstruct the expectation values of the original system by gluing
together as shown around (2.6), all we have to do is know the expectation values for each
pair ( ˇCα, ˇΓα). Before showing that procedure (Sec. 2.3), we review several facts needed
for the complete reconstruction and later discussions.

2.2 Brief reviews on the partition functions and loops expecta-

tion values

In this section, we review the following ﬁve points :

0. Overall renormalization factors

1. Formula for no defect cases

2. Gluing (= gauging process on the 4D side)

3. Formula in the presence of loops

4. Partially Higgsing or partially closing on punctures.

See [50, 66] on the q-deformed Yang-Mills, and see also a review [48] when q = 1. Refer
to [1, 15, 67] on the class S punctures.

Here we deﬁne q-number as

[n]q :=

qn/2 − q−n/2
q1/2 − q−1/2 .

(2.3)

dimq R denotes the q-dimension of an irreducible representation R. See (A.7) for its deﬁ-
nition. If we want to change the convention from q-deformed Yang-Mills one to Liouville-
Toda one, all we have to do is to replace the above q-number by quasi q-number

(cid:104)n(cid:105)q := (−1)n−1 qn − q−n
q − q−1 .

(2.4)

6 Let e,v and f be the number of edges, junctions of ˇΓ and regions in ˇC, respectively. By construction,
f = n holds true. The closedness of the network ˇΓ and the trivalence property of junctions also says
2e = 3v. The Euler’s theorem applied to ˇC ignoring all the punctures says 2− 2g = f − e + v. Combined
with all, we ﬁnally have the claim χ ˇC = 2 − 2g − n = − 1

2 v = −(cid:96).

pairs of punctures as dashed lines.

0. Overall renormalization factors

On the comparison between the SCIs in the Schur limit and q-deformed Yang-Mills parti-
tion functions, there is a bit diﬀerence between two : There are additional overall factors
in the SCIs. It consists of two types : a prefactor depending only on q and renormalization
factors K(a, q) assigned to punctures. The former factor is irrelevant in our discussion
and we neglect it. The latter one is given by the inverse square root of the SCI of SU (N )
free vector multiples. The q-deformed Yang-Mills partition functions are obtained by re-
moving this factor for each puncture from the SCI expressions and replacing each vector
contribution by 1 which can be interpreted as the integral measure over the fugacity.
Therefore, this factor can also be ignored as long as we see the leading order in the q-
expansion of the expressions, which is exactly done in Sec.2.4 in this paper. We need the
concrete expressions of such factors if we compute at higher order in the q-expansion.

1. Formula for no defect cases

When (cid:101)C is a genus (cid:101)g Riemann surface with (cid:101)n punctures with SU (N ) holonomies, 7 its
partition function I(cid:101)C({z}) is given by
(cid:88)
I(cid:101)C({z}) =
(dimq R)χ(cid:101)C

where R runs over all unitary irreducible representations of SU (N ), {z} represents the
set of holonomies and i is the index of punctures.

For each summand labelled by R, we can represent the Riemann surface with which

R is assigned. This interpretation will be important later.

2. Gluing

There is a natural operation, gluing, which identiﬁes two holonomies on diﬀerent punctures
and connect them geometrically. On the 4D SCFT side, there are two SU (N ) ﬂavor
symmetries which are identiﬁed [68].

7In the language of class S theory, they are called maximal (or full) punctures.

If we have two pairs of a Riemann surface with punctures and generic networks on it
allowing the case of empty, which are denoted by (CA, ΓA) and (CB, ΓB), we can construct
new one (CAB, ΓA(cid:116)ΓB) by gluing each pair of several punctures. See Fig. 3. Let IC,Γ({z})
be the expectation values of the 2D topological q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on C with
Wilson network defect Γ. The corresponding expectation values can be constructed as

ICAB,ΓA(cid:116)ΓB ({a},{b}) =

(2.6)

where [dz] is the Haar measure of SU (N ), {z} are gauged fugacities and {a} and {b} are
ungauged ones on CA and CB, respectively. The independence of gluing orders is obvious.

3. Formula in the presence of loops

According to the result in [24, 25], the SCI in the presence of 4D loop operators turns
out to coincide with the VEV of Wilson loops in 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills as discussed
in [51]. This can be obtained by simply adding the corresponding SU (N ) character on
gluing as seen soon later.

In this case, Γ is a pure loop γ along a one cycle in C as depicted in Fig. 4. Let us cut

Figure 4: A 2D Wilson loop around the cylindrical part in C.

along the Wilson loop labelled by an irreducible representation RW , which is exactly the
reversed operation to the previous gluing, and assume that they are separated after the
cut for simplicity. 8 Let z denote the new holonomy or fugacity along the new boundary
cycle. Using the new Riemann surfaces CA and CB which have two additional punctures
compared to C, we can express the Wilson loop expectation value of q-deformed Yang-
Mills as 9

If we have two isolated regions across an edge labelled by RW , to each summand in
(2.8), we can assign irreducible representations RA and RB to CA and CB, respectively.
(cid:54)= 0 and we have the constraint
See Fig.5. The summand vanishes unless N
RB ∈ RA⊗RW . In particular, in our convention, the charge on each edge is a fundamental
representation ∧a(cid:3) and the constraint on RA and RB becomes powerful, which turn out
to be useful in the analysis in Sec. 2.3.1.
Let us make a few remarks. When ZR denotes the center charge of R, this constraint
leads to ZRB + a = ZRA mod N when RW = ∧a(cid:3). This implies that the expectation
values vanish unless all the intersection numbers of any one cycles 10 with the Wilson
networks vanish. For example, in the case that C is an once-punctured torus, the Wilson
loop along α-cycle vanishes. In particular, when the puncture is special one called simple
or minimum, this introduces a Wilson loop in (cid:3) in some duality frames on the 4D SU (N )
gauge theory side but it is localized at a point in S3 which is a compact space.
Its
center charge is not screened by the dynamical matter because all belongs to the adjoint
representations and this theory is anomalous because there is a single source with a non-
trivial Abelian charge on the compact space [69, 70].

4. Partially Higgsing/closing
If we have global SU (N ) symmetry in 4d N =2 SCFTs, there are BPS primary operators in
the same supermultiplet as the ﬂavor current belongs to. They are the triplet of SU (2)R
R-symmetry and the adjoint representation of SU (N ) global symmetry. By giving a
nilpotent VEV to the highest weight of those operators at UV point, we have another
SCFTs at that point in the IR. This is called partially Higgsing/closure operation [67,71].
The nilpotent orbit of SU (N ) can be always uniquely mapped to the Jordan normal
forms JY = ⊕iJni whose all eigenvalues vanish and they are classiﬁed by the partition
Y = [n1, n2, . . . , nd] of N . Now that SU (2)R × SU (N ) global symmetry is spontaneously
broken into a subgroup U (1) × GY . In particular, this U (1) is generated by

In conclusion, the partially

(2.11)

As for the notation used here, see the beginning of Sec. 3. Hereafter, we use the transpose
of Y to specify the type of punctures. For example, [N ] represents the full (maximal)
puncture and [2, 1N−2] does the simple (minimum) puncture.

2.3 A proposal for closed Wilson networks

At this stage, any expectation value of any network defect is a function of holonomies
for SU (N ) global symmetries on each maximal puncture. Recall that we can always take
each SU (N ) holonomy in the maximal torus TN−1 which is a N -tuple of U (1) holonomies
a1, a2, . . . , aN with the constraint a1a2 ··· aN = 1 but there left the ambiguity of its
permutation. The invariance under the permutations (or conjugacy actions of SU (N ))
says that the expectation values can be expanded with the characters of SU (N ) again
and written as

I ˇC,ˇΓ({a}) =

BˇΓ:{R}

χRp(ai).

(2.12)

(cid:88)

{Rp}

n(cid:89)

p=1

n(cid:89)

where {Rp} means that each Rp runs over the set of irreducible representations of SU (N ).
We also use the same n as before for the number of maximal punctures on ˇC. As we have
seen in (2.5), for any 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills partition functions without defects, the
coeﬃcient B in the character expansion is diagonal in {Ri} and each component is given
by (dimq R)χ ˇC . In other words,

B:{R} = (dimq R)χ ˇC

δRp,R

(2.13)

p=1

where δRp,R gives 1 when Rp = R and 0 otherwise.

Now our goal is to give the procedure for computations of BˇΓ:{R}. For that purpose,
let us interpret this as a Boltzmann factor of a statistical mechanics on a lattice system
following three steps :

10

1. Make a dual ideal triangulation

The Riemann surface ˇC is decomposed into the several components by removing
the locus of network defects ˇΓ. The previous construction via fat graphs ensures
the natural one-to-one correspondence between the components of regions and the
boundaries/punctures. Now consider the dual quiver on ˇC associated with the net-
work ˇΓ. This is obtained when each region or puncture and network’s edge are
mapped into a point and an arrow with the charge, respectively. At this stage, the
summation in (2.12) says that there lives a discrete but inﬁnite physical degree
of freedom labelled by the irreducible representations of SU (N ) or the dominant
weights on each vertex. Any junction is mapped into a triangle because of the triva-
lence property of the network. Note that similar operations already appeared many
times in various contexts, see [2, 36] for example. So we have (ideal) triangulations
with a charge on each edge, of ˇC. Two or three vertices of a triangle are allowed
to be common at this stage but, in Sec. 2.3.1, we will see that we can ignore such
triangulations. Note also that the number of triangles is given by −2χ ˇC recalling
footnote. 6.

2. Consider the allowed conﬁgurations of dominant weights

The whole conﬁguration space is the set of all maps from each quiver vertex to an
irreducible representation or a dominant weight. However, for many conﬁgurations,
BˇΓ,{R} in (2.12) vanishes as we will see later and we can restrict the range of the
summation to the non-vanishing conﬁgurations discussed in 2.3.1.

3. Give the Boltzmann factor for each conﬁguration

As with the ordinary statistical mechanics such as Ising models, we assume the
Boltzmann factor of a given conﬁguration is the product of local Boltzmann factors
(cid:52)
over all the triangles. In other words, the local Boltzmann factor denoted B
λA,λB,λC
is a function on triples of dominant weights living on three vertices of a single
triangle (cid:52) and the total Boltzmann factor is given by

(cid:89)

where (cid:52) runs over all the triangles on the ideal triangulation of ˇC. The concrete
formula of B

will be given as (2.19) in Sec. 2.3.2.

λA,λB,λC

2.3.1 Selection rules on dominant weights

Here we exhaust all the conﬁgurations whose Boltzmann factors are non-vanishing. The
strategy is same as that used in [51].

Let us consider (aAB, aBC, aCA)-junction and three regions around it as shown in Fig.6.
There are still two types of junctions, inﬂowing one and outgoing one but hereafter we
focus on outﬂowing one only because the ﬁnal expressions for B(cid:52) are same for both

types. Let three dominant weights living on its vertices be λA, λB and λC and deﬁne
λXY := λX − λY for X, Y ∈ {A, B, C}. The gluing procedure stated in Sec. 2.2 tells that
R(λY ) ⊗ ∧aXY (cid:3) contains R(λX) for (X, Y ) = (A, B), (B, C) and (C, A). This statement
equals to λXY ∈ Π(∧aXY (cid:3)) where Π(R) is a set of all weights of the highest representation
R. Then there is a unique subset EXY of {1, 2, . . . , N} consisting of aXY elements such
that λXY =
hs. The cycle condition λAB + λBC + λCA = 0 means that EAB,EBC
and ECA has no common element and EAB (cid:116) EBC (cid:116) ECA = {1, 2, . . . , N}. In conclusion,
allowed conﬁgurations has several sectors determined by the choice of EAB, EBC and ECA
which is a partition of {1, 2, . . . , N} into three sets. Note that there are
aAB!aBC!aCA!
sectors. And in each sector, there is a summation over λA for example, 11 with a constraint
that all λA, λB and λC are dominant weights. 12

Note also that two adjacent vertices must have diﬀerent center charges as we have
seen at part 3 in Sec. 2.2 and we can say that there is no edge whose starting vertex and
terminating one are common.

2.3.2 Conjectural formula for the local Boltzmann factor

The last task is to show the way to get the local Boltzmann factor for any allowed triple
of dominant weights λA, λB and λC.

Before going to the ﬁnal result, we must prepare some tools to express it simply. First
of all, we introduce a mathematical object playing central roles in our computations.
This is just an assembly of integers designated by two labels h and α = αh. h runs over
1, 2, . . . , N − 1 and α does over 1, 2, . . . , N − h for each h. Therefore, this object consists
of 1

2N (N − 1) integers. We call such object “pyramid” hereafter. See Fig. 7.

In particular we have a natural map deﬁned just below which sends a weight λ =

determined if we specify the sector.

11Of course, it is possible to choose λB or λC instead. In all cases, the other two dominant weights are
12In other words, this is just summation over λA and pairs of λB − λA and λC − λA.

Hereafter, we permit an abuse of notation. We use the same symbol ˆλ for the pyramids
not in the image of this inclusion map too. In such cases, ˆλ is to be considered as a single
symbol as a whole and λ is meaningless.

Next, we deﬁne majority function mj for three variables :

mj(a, b, c) :=

b = a or c = a
a = b or c = b
a = c or b = c

.

(2.16)

Since, hereafter, there appears no case that all variables are distinct, this deﬁnition is
well-deﬁned in our usage. In particular, we extend this to the case that the variables are
pyramids as follows :

mj( ˆλA, ˆλB, ˆλC) := {mj(( ˆλA)h:α, ( ˆλB)h:α, ( ˆλC)h:α)}h:α.

three dominant weights λA, λB and λC living on its vertices. This is expressed as

Based on this proposal, we derive several skein relations in App. B, which provides a
(mathematical) evidence that this proposal works well. As we will see in the following
examples, an implication of global symmetry enhancements also supports the validity of
the above formula.

2.4 Concrete computations

In this section, we see three examples : T3-theory, T4-theory including a Higgsed theory
of it, and T4[N ]-theories for general N . TN -theory is a SCFT in the case that C is a two-
sphere with three maximal punctures labelled by [N ]. T4[N ]-theory corresponds to a two-
sphere with four maximal punctures. In the ﬁrst two cases, namely, T3 and T4-theories,
these theories are Argyres-Seiberg dual theories to some theories whose Lagrangians are
unknown yet [72, 73] although, for the T3-theory, there is an interesting proposal that an
N =1 Lagrangian theory ﬂows in the IR to that theory [74]. There we consider elementary
defects as shown in Fig. 8. They were discussed explicitly at ﬁrst in [36] and shown to be
elementary generators of the line operator algebra in [38]. They are called pants networks
there. In the last example, we consider the two loops wrapping diﬀerent one cycles as
shown in Fig. 9.

T3 theory

In this theory, we can see that the above conjectural procedure exactly reproduces the
previous result computed in [51]. There is just only pants network defect in T3 theory up
to charge conjugate operation, namely, aAB = aBC = aCA = 1. Using cyclic symmetry
A → B → C → A, we can take EBC = {3} without loss of generality and write the
Dynkin labels of λC as [n, m]. Note that λB = [n, m − 1]. Then there are two sectors :
(EAB, ECA) = ({1},{2}) and ({2},{1}). The former and latter give λA = [n + 1, m − 1]
and [n − 1, m], respectively, and the local Boltzmann factors are given by

There is only (2, 1, 1)-junction and, therefore, there are three types of pants networks.
However, their expectation values are exchanged under the cyclic permutation aAB →
aBC → aCA → aAB and we can set |EAB| = 2 without loss of generality. There are 12
distinct sectors for (2, 1, 1)-junction. If we expand the q-deformed Yang-Mills expectation

Next, let us consider T[4],[4],[22]-theory where C is a two-sphere with two maximal
punctures and one [2, 2]-type puncture. The reason why we focus on this case is that this
theory enjoys the global symmetry enhancement from SU (4) × SU (4) × SU (2) into E7
symmetry [72, 75].

On performing partially closing operations and the q-expansion, we must take account
of the higher powers of q in the above analysis because χSU (4)
(x) is a series of q1/2 includ-
ing negative powers, where x is a UV holonomy associated with the [2, 2]-type puncture.
See part.4 in Sec. 2.2 as to the partially closing operation. By taking it into considera-
tions, it turns out that there are following four possible conﬁgurations contributing to the

Recalling the fact that the Coulomb branch complex dimension of T[4],[4],[22] theory is 1,
this is consistent with this result that there is only one elementary network reﬂecting the
global E7 symmetry.

Dual intersecting loops in T4fulls

Let us consider the case with a = b = 1 in Fig. 9. This theory reduces into SU (N )
superconformal QCD (SCQCD) on partially closing two of four punctures into the simple
([2, 1N−2]-type) punctures. On that theory, these two loops correspond to the ordinary

fundamental Wilson loop and some ’t Hooft loop. 13 Using the crossing resolutions, this
decomposes into four components. By evaluating each component and then by summing
them up, we have the following results for the whole Boltzmann factor (the deﬁnition of
EXY is given in Sec. 2.3.1) :

also λB = λD.

It is possible to rewrite the above expression into

3 Composite surface-line systems

As explained in the introduction, in the 2D system, the geometric counterparts of 4D line
operators and 4D surface operators are networks and punctures, respectively. As long
as we treat either only surface operators or only line operators, the projection onto C is
natural to discuss the 4D physics. However, if we have line defects bounded on 2D surface
defects, it is not unique picture and there appears the new direction which line defects
are localized in but surface defects extend along.

In Sec. 3.1, we review several basic facts needed later. Next, we take a look at the
geometrical conﬁgurations of two types of defects in Sec. 3.2. In Sec. 3.3, we discuss the
skein relations including fully degenerate punctures. First, by introducing new topological
moves, we derive such skein relations in some simple cases. Then, in the last Sec. 3.4, we
rederive more general skein relations assuming the projection invariance.

corresponding to the irreducible representation R.

Liouville-Toda convention, which is the same as that used in Sec.3 in [51]. See the footnote
5 as to this point.

Surface defect

It was discussed in [53] that the SCIs in the presence of surface defects can be physically
obtained by coupling a free hypermultiplet carrying U (1) baryon symmetry at UV and by
taking the IR limit of that theory after giving variant VEVs to Higgs branch operators. At
the mathematical level, this corresponds to taking the residues at a pole in the fugacity
complex planes, associated with the surface operator’s charges and ﬁnally results in a
diﬀerence operator acting on the ﬂavor fugacities of the original theory.
The above procedure is expected to reproduce in the IR the same defects as those from
codimension four defects in 6D N =(2, 0) SCFTs and, in fact, this was checked in [32] by
comparing these results with 4D SCIs coupled to the elliptic genera of the 2D N =(2, 2)
theories living on the surface defects. The diﬀerence operators in the Schur limit actually
form the representation ring of su(N ) because the codimension two defects are labelled
by representations of su(N ) [54, 55].

According to [53–55], we rewrite the diﬀerence operator for the surface defect labelled

by an irreducible representation S as

(cid:98)GS = ((cid:112)∆Haar(a))−1 ·

 (cid:88)

λ∈Π(S)

q−N (λ,λ)aN λ(cid:98)∆−λ

 · ((cid:112)∆Haar(a))

where we have renormalized so that they form the representation ring of su(N ) exactly,

∆Haar(a) is the Haar measure of SU (N ) and (cid:98)∆−λ acts on a holonomy a by q−2λa. The

values are given by

¯E (S)
R = χS(q−2(ρ+λR)) =

dimq S
dimq R

χR(q−2(ρ+λS )).

(3.5)

Finally, we remark on the mathematical relation between the codimension four defects
and the codimension two defects [44]. In Liouville-Toda CFT set-up, the general vertex
operator is given by Vα(z) =: e(cid:104)α,φ(z)(cid:105) : where α is a vector in h∨ which is the dual to
Cartan subalgebra, z ∈ C and φ(z) is the Liouville-Toda scalar ﬁeld. This corresponds to
the codimension two defect when α − (b + 1/b)ρ ∈ iRN−1 (cid:39) h∨. On the other hand, the
codimension four defect labelled by a SU (N ) irreducible representation S is obtained by
taking the limit α → −bλS or −1
λS. 15 The vertex operator in this limit is called fully
b
degenerate and we also refer to the corresponding punctures as fully degenerate punctures
which exactly represent the 4D surface defects.

In 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills theory, the procedure similar to the above one is given

3.2 Geometrical conﬁgurations
Originally, the bulk geometry of 6d N =(2, 0) SCFT is S3 × S1
E × C. Both surface defects
and line defects in 4D wrap S1
E reduction, the geometry is the product
of C and a S1
H is a Hopf ﬁber which is the
support of surface defects in 4D. 16 On the other hand, line defects in 4D are networks
on C. Therefore, both types of defects are knots with junction in the ﬁber geometry
H × C =: M and localized at the same point in base geometry S2.
S1
In the following
discussion, we regard S1
H as an interval IH whose two end points are identiﬁed. Then
let Cin and Cout denote two boundaries of IH × C. We interpret the surface defects as a
defect running from a point in Cin to the same point in Cout along IH-direction.
Note that if we consider a 6d SCFT on S4 × C, a similar argument holds true. This is
because OPEs of two BPS defects are expected to be determined locally and independent

15The two limits correspond to two types of conﬁgurations of surface defects in S4

b . See the next section

3.2.

16There are at least two kinds of surface defects when line defects are absent. The other one is obtained

by exchanging two SCI fugacities p and q as seen in [53].

from the global background geometry. Concretely, a surface defect extends along a S2 =
{(z, w = 0, x) ∈ C × C × R | b2|z|2 + x5 = 1} in S4 = {(z, w, x) ∈ C × C × R | b2|z|2 +
b−2|w|2 + x5 = 1} and some line defects living on that S1 = {(z, w = 0, x5 = x∗) ∈
C × C × R} where x∗ is an arbitrary constant satisfying |x∗| < 1. Since only the local
geometry around the defect locus is relevant, instead of S1
H, we take the new direction
as the x5 direction (open interval) in this case. Therefore, it is expected that the skein
relations discussed in Sec. 3.3 are also applied to Liouville-Toda CFTs and we can check,
in several examples, the claim that they are common in both systems. The relation q
and b is given in [24] or [51] as q = eiπb2. The phenomenon inherent in the S4
b case is
that there simultaneously exist two types of line operators and it seems to be necessary
to treat them in the full ﬁve dimensional geometry rather than three dimensional one.
Note also that there are two distinct origins of the non-commutativity of line operators
correspondingly. One comes from the Poynting vector in the bulk generated by line’s
charges as discussed in [26,64] and this classical picture also occurs in the Schur index case.
The other interpretation is similar but diﬀerent. There, both line operators cannot be
genuine line operators and either should be a surface operator. Then, two operators have
some contact interactions under the exchange of their ordering in the 4D bulk [64,81–83].

3.3 Skein relations with fully degenerate punctures

At ﬁrst, we use the same projection of M onto the 2D plane as before. This is the
projection onto C which we call “C-projection”.

If the 4D surface defects are topological in M , by deforming its orbit in M , we expect

the following relation :

(3.8)

Here we must take the framing factor appearing in R-move I (3.3) into consideration.

Let a white dot (a circle) and a black one (a ﬁlled circle) in the C-projection plane
represent each intersection point of a surface defect with Cin and Cout, respectively. Then
new moves appear :

S

(3.9)

On the left hand side, a line labelled by S stems from the white dot in M and, on the right
hand side, a line by S goes into the black dot in M . We call this relation Reidemeister
move V (R-move V). In particular, because two types of dots are identiﬁed in S1
H, they

21

coincide in C-projection and we have

R

=

.

R

(3.10)

We refer to the edges with dots on it as “punctured edges”. Be aware that the punctured
edges are just open lines in the three dimensional space M . A view from the right hand
towards the left hand is shown in Fig. 11. See also Sec. 3.4 for the detail.

What we are interested in is the situation where a line in C passes near a fully degen-

erate puncture. The above relation (3.10) leads to

and now we can apply the crossing resolutions (3.1) to the network representation on the
right hand. 17

17Another more useful way to derive the same result is to separate the locations of ingoing and outgoing
punctures (white and black points) in C ﬁrstly, to apply the skein relations secondly and to merge them
again ﬁnally.

and the other relation can be obtained by mapping q to q−1.

If we apply either relation to the loop wrapping a cylinder and one fully degenerate
puncture near it, there appear two kinds of knots. One winds around the cylinder by one
time as it goes from Cin to Cout and the other does in the opposite way. Recalling the fact
that there lives 2d N =(2, 2) U (1) gauged linear σ model on the surface defect labelled by
(cid:3) [32, 52], it is expected that these loops in M represent the U (1) Wilson loops charged
±1 according to the widing orientation in the 2D system.

General case
How do the similar relations look like for any pair S = ∧(cid:96)(cid:3) and R = ∧k(cid:3) ? From the
above examples, we can expect that the general skein relations are

In the case of (cid:96) = 1, each reduces into (3.16) and (3.17). We see in the next section 3.4
that these relations are indeed reproduced in another approach.

24

3.4 Other projections

The requirement of the topological property of networks in M means that their projection
onto a 2D plane can be taken arbitrarily. So far we have used C-projection, but actually,
we can consider other projections onto a plane extending along IH-direction. We call
those projections “H-projections”.

Now it is possible to directly obtain the same result as before by applying the skein
relation in a H-projection. Let us view the crossing network on the left hand side in
(3.20) from the right side and apply the crossing resolution on the new projection. This
can be expressed as

(cid:96)

Cout

k

min(k,(cid:96))(cid:88)

(3.21)

This relation exactly matches with the previous expressions (3.20) and we have a relation
between distinct projections like

(3.22)

where the left hand side is the usual C-projection but the right one is a H-projection
including IH direction.

Finally, we make a brief comment on the reproduction of the relation (3.6). This can

be geometrically expressed as

or locally

S

R

= σRχR(q−ρ−λS ) S

R

= σRχR(q−ρ−λS )

4 Proposal for punctured network defects

We have independently discussed the computations of expectation values for closed net-
work and the geometrical structures of the composite surface-line systems and here we
will unify two things. In Sec. 4.1, we compare the previous new skein relations with the
computation of q-deformed Yang-Mills expectation values or the Schur indices. From
the comparison, we can extract the operator action of some punctured networks. Based
on this discussion, in Sec. 4.2, we propose the modiﬁed formula for general punctured
networks and interpret the modiﬁcation as the addition of the local Boltzmann factors
assigned with dual arrowed edges.

4.1 Coexistence of closed network and isolated punctures

In this section, let C be a sphere with several punctures and γ be a Wilson loop wrapping
a tube in C. This is the same situation as discussed in part 3 in Sec. 2.2. The general
set-up can be discussed in the similar way. Recalling the discussion around (2.8), let us
cut along γ and decouple the Riemann surface C into the two parts which we call CA and
CB here. In the following, we see the operator structure in two distinct basis.

Fugacity/Holonomy basis

The formula (2.8) says that the whole partition function is given by

(cid:73)

[da]ICA(a, . . .)χM (a)ICB (a−1, . . .).

(4.1)

Now let us add a surface defect labelled by S. There are two choices of its addition,

namely, the fully degenerate puncture on CA or on CB as shown in Fig. 12.

Figure 12: Coexistence of a 2D Wilson loop and a fully degenerate puncture in C. Left
corresponds to (4.2) (4.19) and right does to (4.4) (4.19).

They are evaluated as

ICA(cid:116)WM (γ)(CB,S) :=

and

I(CA,S)(cid:116)WM (γ)CB :=

(cid:73)

[da]ICA(a, . . .)χM (a)((cid:99)SSICB )(a−1, . . .)
[da]((cid:99)SSICA)(a, . . .)χM (a)ICB (a−1, . . .)

(cid:73)

MCACBRBRASMCACBRBRAS(cid:73)

=

[da]ICA(a, . . .)(cid:99)SS(χM (a)ICB )(a−1, . . .)

where we use the self-adjoint property of the diﬀerence operator (cid:99)SS. and in general give

diﬀerent answers. In particular, the special case M = ∧(cid:96)(cid:3) and S = ∧k(cid:3) is important.
Let Π(R) be the set of weights for an irreducible representation R and we also introduce
a subset as

Π(∧k(cid:3),∧(cid:96)(cid:3))s :=(cid:8)(λ, µ) ∈ Π(∧k(cid:3)) × Π(∧(cid:96)(cid:3)) | (λ, µ) = s − k(cid:96)

In the following network representations in this subsection, we identify two end points

a(N µ+λ)/2∆χ−µa(N µ+λ)/2 = q−(cid:96)(N−(cid:96)) (cid:88)

and another diﬀerence operator

(cid:88)

ˆO (k,(cid:96))

:=

s

(λ,µ)∈Π(∧k(cid:3),∧(cid:96)(cid:3))s

(λ,µ)∈Π(∧k(cid:3),∧(cid:96)(cid:3))s

We also use the formula

aλ(cid:98)∆−µ = q2(λ,µ)(cid:98)∆−µaλ

aλ(cid:98)∆χ−µ = q2(λ,µ)(cid:98)∆χ−µaλ.

We repeat the same analysis in another new basis. For that purpose, let us expand the
partition functions on CA and CB by the SU (N ) characters as

[da(cid:48)]χRA(a(cid:48)−1)ICA(a(cid:48),{b})

(4.14)

(cid:73)
(cid:73)

FRA(a,{b}) :=
GRB (a.{c}) :=

and then we can express the expectation value of the Wilson loop in the representation
M as

(cid:104)F| ˆWM|G(cid:105) :=

RA,RB

[da]χRA(a−1)FRA(a−1,{b})χM (a)χRB (a)GRB (a,{c}).

GR({c})|R(cid:105)

|F(cid:105) =

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

orthonormal basis.

Using the eigenvalues of diﬀerence operators (3.5), the addition of surface operators

in this basis corresponding to (4.2) and (4.4) are expressed as

defects do as diagonal multiplications in this basis.
When M = ∧(cid:96)(cid:3) and S = ∧k(cid:3), we can also repeat the similar computation to the
previous one. First of all, let us rewrite the eigenvalue ¯E (S)

The modiﬁcation of the statistical model previously introduced in Sec. 2.3 is simple
: add another local Boltzmann factor for pairs of two adjacent dominant weights or,
equivalently, edges. The last result
(4.27) in the previous section suggests that this
factor is given by

It is the interesting problem to prove the equalities (3.19) or (3.20) based on the dual

statistical model but we have no proof for them in general cases yet.

5 Summary and discussion

In this paper, we propose the conjectural computational procedures for the general closed
and punctured network defects in the 2D q-deformed Yang-Mills theory. Such networks
are geometrically knots with junctions in the three dimensional space which includes C
and one of 4D directions and expected to be the counterparts of composite surface-line
systems in 4D.

Now we list several problems to be solved in future. In the gauge theory perspective, it
is necessary to discuss the 4D descriptions of composite surface-line systems and compare
the SCIs with the expectation values. Since the three geometry is encoded in 5D space,
it is possible to describe them based on 5D SYM language like [84]. It is also interesting
to relate them to the well-known 3D-3D correspondence story [24,85] where the 3D N =2
gauge theories on S3 and complex Chern-Simons theories on hyperbolic spaces are related.
More additions of defects in this correspondence were also discussed in [86], for example.
There are still several generalizations in this set-up. One thing is to deﬁne and to
incorporate general open networks which are expected to be composite systems of codi-
mension two and four defects. The other is the extension to general simple Lie algebra,
in particular D-series [87, 88] or in the presence of twisted lines in A2N−1-series [89].
Although it is expected that the ﬁnite area extension is straightforward [90], are there
interesting applications ?

There are also several mathematical problems : the justiﬁcation of global symmetry
enhancement in all order q expansion in Sec. 2.4, skein relations in the presence of general
punctures, reproduction of q = 1 limit results where there is the unambiguous deﬁnition
of Wilson networks, more on quantum groups [91] and relation to integrable models as
remarked in Sec. 2.5. The relation to higher Teichm¨uller space structure [36] or Liouville-
Toda analysis [92,93] is also interesting because the local information of OPEs are expected
to be same in both S4

b and S1 ×q S3 systems.

A More mathematics on the dual model
Here we develop some useful tools to compute the local Boltzmann factor B(cid:52) using (2.19)
and to prove some skein relations in App.B. First of all, recall the notations of Lie algebras
and their representations. Consider the case that the Lie algebra is su(N ). R(λ) denotes
the irreducible representation associated with a dominant weight λ, λR does the dominant
weight to R conversely and Π(R) does the set of weights in R. ωα for α = 1, 2, ..., N − 1
are fundamental weights, hi for i = 1, 2, . . . , N are weights in Π(R(ω1) = (cid:3)) 18 and there
is a relation between two as ha = ωa− ωa−1 where ωN = ω0 = 0. We also use the standard
metric in weight vectors determined by hi = ei − 1

ei and (ei, ej) = δi,j.

N(cid:88)

A.1 Deﬁnitions

i=1

Let us start by repeating some deﬁnitions which appeared in Sec. 2.3.2.
We introduced a mathematical object called “pyramid”. This is just an assembly of
integers designated by two labels h and α = αh. h runs over 1, 2, . . . , N − 1 and α does
2N (N − 1) integers.
over 1, 2, . . . , N − h for each h. Therefore, this object consists of 1
There is an inclusion of weights as follows :

N−1(cid:88)

β=1

where λ =

ˆλh:α :=

λβ

(A.1)

β=α

λβωβ. We also use the same symbol ˆλ for the pyramids not in the image

α+h−1(cid:88)

of this inclusion map. In such cases, ˆλ is just single symbol itself and λ is meaningless.
Note that the addition can be deﬁned as

(c1ˆs1 + c2ˆs2)h:α := c1(ˆs1)h:α + c2(ˆs2)h:α

(A.2)

which is consistent with the above inclusion map in the sense that it preserves the original
additional structure in the weight vector space. ˆ0 is the identity element of this operation.
There can be also a product deﬁned as

(ˆs1 ∗ ˆs2)h:α := (ˆs1)h:α(ˆs2)h:α.

The distributive property is obvious.

We also deﬁned two functions :

1.

(2.16) majority function mj for three variables :

a

b
c

mj(a, b, c) :=

b = a or c = a
a = b or c = b
a = c or b = c

(A.3)

(A.4)

18The perfect order of the indices of hi is determined by the partial order in the weight lattice.

32

and

mj( ˆλ1, ˆλ2, ˆλ3) := {mj(( ˆλ1)h:α, ( ˆλ2)h:α, ( ˆλ3)h:α)}h:α

(A.5)

As there appears no case that all variables are distinct, this deﬁnition is well-deﬁned
in our usage

2.

(2.18) q-dimension function D :

D[ˆλ] :=

N−1(cid:89)

N−h(cid:89)

h=1

α=1

[(ˆλ)h:α + h]q

[h]q

and there is a simple relation to the ordinary q-dimension as

dimq R(λ) = D[ˆλ]

A.2 Convenient formulae

Now let us start the argument recalling the discussion in Sec.2.3.1. Consider three regions
called A,B and C clockwise around a trivalent junction and denote their dominant weights
λA, λB and λC. See Fig.6 in Sec.2.3.1. We also denote the outgoing charge associated
with the edge between the regions X and Y by aXY for (X, Y ) = (A, B), (B, C) and
(C, A).

We deﬁne the following objects in order.

N−1(cid:88)

N(cid:88)
(cid:88)

s=1

λXY := λX − λY =:

Λα

XY ωα =:

λs
XY hs.

(A.14)

λs
XY is not uniquely determined due to the condition

α=1

hs = 0 in the root vector space.

We can ﬁnd that λs

But it is uniquely determined if we impose the conditions λs
XY = 1}
where |EXY | = aXY follows and EXY := {1, 2, . . . , N}\EXY = EY X. The cycle condition
λAB + λBC + λCA = 0 tells us EAB (cid:116) EBC (cid:116) ECA = {1, 2, . . . , N} (disjoint union). Now
we have

XY is either 1 or 0 and deﬁne EXY := {s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}|λs

XY = 0.

s

XY ≥ 0 and ∃s λs

(A.15)
and we obtain two other similar expressions by permuting the above cyclically as A →
B → C → A. This formula will turn out to be useful in the next section.

mj(λA, λB, λC) = ˆλA + ˆfEAB,ECA

Finally, we list a few propositions also used later.

1.

2.

3.

D[ˆx + ˆz]D[ˆy] = D[ˆx]D[ˆy + ˆz]

(A.16)

when (ˆx − ˆy) ∗ ˆz = ˆ0
Each element in pyramid satisﬁes x = (ˆx)h:α = (ˆy)h:α = y or z = (ˆz)h:α = 0 and
then [x + z]q[y]q = [x]q[y + z]q

ˆfI,J ∗ ˆfK,L = ˆ0 for (I (cid:116) J) ∩ (K (cid:116) L) = φ
Using ( ˆfP,Q)h:α = 0 for α /∈ P (cid:116) Q, this statement holds true.

(A.17)

ˆfI,J ∗ ˆfI,K = ˆ0 for J ∩ K = φ

(A.18)
Assume ( ˆfI,J )h:α (cid:54)= 0 and ( ˆfI,K)h:α (cid:54)= 0 for same (h, α). If α ∈ I, α + h ∈ J and
α + h ∈ K but it is impossible by deﬁnition and J ∩ K = φ. This is same for the
case α + h ∈ I. So the assumption is always false and the above statement is true.

34

Note that there is a more general formula including last two propositions :

ˆfI,J ∗ ˆfK,L = ( ˆfI∩K,J∩L)2 − ( ˆfI∩L,J∩K)2

(A.19)

where ˆx2 := ˆx ∗ ˆx.

B Derivation of several skein relations

Based on our proposal for local Boltzmann factor
relations in this appendix.

(2.19), we prove elementary skein

B.1 Associativity

The associativity skein relation is given by

Here s = p + q = v − r, t = q + r = v − p and v = p + q + r. Its dual triangle quiver is

λD

.

(B.2)

R

λA

which is the ﬂip of triangulations. We have introduced here P := ECB, Q := EBA and
R := EAD

The local Boltzmann factors’ expression associated with this equality is
D[ ˆλB + ˆfQ,P ]D[ ˆλA + ˆfR,P(cid:116)Q] = D[ ˆλB + ˆfQ(cid:116)R,P ]D[ ˆλA + ˆfR,Q]

for any λA, λB, λC and λD. In the following, we prove this equality.

Introduce ˆx := ˆλB + ˆfQ,P and ˆy := ˆλA + ˆfR,Q. Now we get

(B.3)

(B.4)

(l.h.s) = D[ˆx]D[ˆy + ˆfR,P ]
(r.h.s) = D[ˆx + ˆfR,P ]D[ˆy].

(B.5)
To apply the proposition (A.16), it is enough to check (ˆx− ˆy)∗ ˆfR,P = ˆ0. Since ˆλB − ˆλA =
ˆhQ = ˆf ¯Q,Q,

(ˆx − ˆy) ∗ ˆfR,P = ( ˆf ¯Q,Q + ˆfQ,P + ˆfR,Q) ∗ ˆfR,P

(B.6)

35

= (2 ˆfR,Q + ˆfP(cid:116)Q(cid:116)R,Q) ∗ ˆfR,P = ˆ0

(B.7)

where we have used the two propositions (A.17) and (A.18) in the last line. Now we has
proved the equality.

B.2 Digon contractions

There is more non-trivial skein relations what we call digon contractions as shown below.

a + b

[a + b]q!
[a]q![b]q!

RB

(B.8)

where [n]q! :=(cid:81)n

embedding

i=1[i]q for a positive integer n.

First of all, let us introduce several deﬁnitions. For ﬁxed EAB, we deﬁne a natural

(cid:96)−1 : {1, 2, . . . , a + b} bijec.−→ EAB
(cid:96)−1

for γ ∈ {1, 2, . . . a + b}

:= (cid:96)−1(γ)
satisfying that 1 ≤ (cid:96)−1

γ

γ < (cid:96)−1

γ(cid:48) ≤ N for 1 ≤ γ < γ(cid:48) ≤ a + b.

(cid:96)i := (cid:96)(i)

for i ∈ EAB

(B.9)
(B.10)

M := {((cid:96)−1

γ(cid:48) − (cid:96)−1

γ , (cid:96)−1
γ )

for any γ(cid:48) > γ}.

(B.11)
By deﬁnition, for any two subsets I,J (I ∩ J = φ) of EAB, it is true that ( ˆfI,J )h:α = 0 for
any (h, α) ∈ M .
Next, let ˇM be the index set of the pyramid for SU (a + b) weights. In other words,
for (ˇh : ˇα) ∈ ˇM , ˇh runs over 1 to a + b − 1 and ˇα does over 1 to a + b − ˇh. The map (cid:96)
induces a new bijection map ˇ(cid:96) from M to ˇM as follows.

(ˇh : ˇα) := ˇ(cid:96)(h, α) := ((cid:96)α+h − (cid:96)α : (cid:96)α)

(B.12)

If we label the representation assigned to the inside region of the digon as S, the left

(B.15)

(B.13)

(B.14)

where we have used hI = ˆf ¯I,I, ¯I = EBA (cid:116) EAS and the proposition (A.16) using also
(A.18) ˆfEBA,I ∗ ˆfEAS ,I = ˆ0. In the 3rd line, we have used ( ˆfEAS ,I)h:α = 0 for (h, α) /∈ M
− (cid:96)−1
ˇα .
and M

ˇ(cid:96)(cid:39) ˇM and redeﬁned (ˆµ)ˇh: ˇα := ( ˆλB)ˇ(cid:96)−1(ˇh, ˇα) + h − ˇh where h = h(ˇh, ˇα) = (cid:96)−1

ˇh+ ˇα

Now what we should prove are two following equations.

ˇα+ˇh−1(cid:88)

ˆµ1:β = ˆµˇh: ˇα

β= ˇα

(cid:92)
hSU (a+b)
(cid:96)(I)

(

)ˇh, ˇα = ( ˆfEAS ,I)ˇ(cid:96)−1(ˇh, ˇα)

(B.16)

(B.17)

The former equality says that ˆµ is the image of a weight µ in the pyramid and follows
from the direct computation based the above deﬁnitions. The latter one means that ˆfEAS ,I
gives an image of a weight in Π(∧b(cid:3)) of SU (a + b), and it also readily follows from the
equality

(cid:92)
hSU (a+b)
(
(cid:96)(I)

)ˇh, ˇα = ( ˆfEAB\I,I)(cid:96)−1

α+h−(cid:96)−1

α :(cid:96)−1

.

irreducible representation R(µ + h(cid:96)(I)) up to the common factor(cid:81)

In conclusion, the numerator in (B.15) equals to the q-dimension of the SU (a + b)
(ˇh: ˇα)[ˇh]q and, the sum
over all the b element subsets of EAB equals to all irreducible representations appearing in
∧b(cid:3) which exactly
the tensor product of R(µ) and ∧b(cid:3). Therefore, this gives dimSU (a+b)
reproduces the prefactor in the right hand of (B.8).

C General charge/network correspondence

This appendix is a complement of the paper [51]. There we see the one-to-one mapping
between the charge lattice for N =4 su(3) theory proposed by Kapustin [21] and A2 net-
works on the 2-torus and also show several examples for AN−1 cases in the appendix.
However, we did not explain the dictionary in detail. Here we state the mapping for
general AN . This is a minimal extension of a work for general A1 class S theories [35]. 19
The generalization and reﬁnement to general class S theories are interesting future prob-
lems. Note that the following relations can hold true in the Liouville-Toda CFTs and also
that the expectation values vanish in q-deformed Yang-Mills when their electric/magnetic
weights are not in the root lattices as explained in part 3 in Sec. 2.2.

C.1 Useful symbol

Here we introduce an useful symbol expressing an element of su(N ) Wilson-’t Hooft
loop charge lattice (Λmw × Λwt)/Wsu(N ) where Λmw, Λwt and Wsu(N ) are the magnetic
19Here we consider N =4 SYM as the very special case of class S theories. The similar relations are
expected to hold true in the N =2∗ gauge theory but precise dictionaries are not established completely
because there appears a ﬂavor symmetry related to the hypermultiplet mass term.

37

weight lattice, the weight lattice and the Weyl reﬂection group, respectively. Note that
Λmw (cid:39) Λwt for su(N ) and then we use the same basis. For a given pair of (µ, λ), we
can always take µ into a dominant weight µ(cid:48) using a Weyl reﬂection. According to this
operation, λ is also mapped into an element λ(cid:48) which is not always uniquely determined.
There, we have a Young diagram YM associated with µ(cid:48). In the same way as (A.14), λ(cid:48)
can be expanded with hs and we have unique elements λ(cid:48)s (s = 1, 2, . . . , N ) which are
non-negative integers. By putting λ(cid:48)s boxes in the s-th row in the similar way as usual
Young diagram, we have a diagram referred to as YE. Now, we make a new diagram
which is a pair of the horizontally ﬂipped and ﬁlled YM and the diagram YE. See Fig. 14
below for examples.

(2h1 + h2, h1 + 2h2)

(h1 + h2 + h3, h4 + h5)

(3h1, 2h1)

(3h1 + h2 + h3 + h4, 2h3 + h5)

(2h1 + 2h2 + h3 + h4, 2h1 + h4 + 2h5)

Figure 14: Several examples for the relation between an element of the su(N ) charge
lattice (above) and its diagrammatic symbol (below).

C.2 Charge to network

For a given charge pair (µ, λ), let Mi be subsets of 1, 2, . . . , N so that there is a box in
YM speciﬁed by i-th column and a-th row only if a ∈ Mi. We also deﬁne Ei in the same
way replacing YM by YE. Then, deﬁne spq as the number of elements of Mp ∩ Eq and Qpq
as an open network like

(s)

(s) ←→
Qpq

q

(C.1)

Using these, the BPS Wilson-’t Hooft line operator in N =4 SU (N ) SYM is geometrically
represented by

(C.2)

where edges are connected on any adjacent parallelograms and each pair of opposite edges
is identiﬁed. Note also that this relation holds up to lower charges (see the beginning of
Sec.4 in [51]). We show two examples.

The reversed operation can be done by computing the trace functions associated with
the network because the trace function is a polynomial of two U (1)N /U (1) fugacities along
α-cycle and β-cycle of the 2-torus.
