Abstract

In physics, we are supposed to learn from experiments what constitutes a good/correct theoreti-

cal/mathematical model of any physical concept, and our physical space should not be an exception.

The best picture of the physical space, in Newtonian physics, is given by the conﬁguration space of

a free particle. The space, as well as the phase space, can be constructed as a representation space

of the relativity symmetry. Starting with the corresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the

construction of a quantum space along the lines of the quantum phase space and demonstrate the

retrieval of the classical picture as an approximation through the contraction of the (relativity)

symmetry and the representations of it. The result suggests a picture of the physical space beyond

that of a ﬁnite dimensional manifold.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum mechanics came into physics after a few hundred years of Newtonian mechan-

ics, as the latter failed to describe physics at the atomic scale and beyond. In our opinion,

however, that quantum revolution has not been completed. It was easy to accept the math-

ematical formulation of the theory, but a lot more diﬃcult to adopt a fundamental change in

our basic perspectives. It is not a surprise, then, that even the great physicists who created

the theory kept trying to think and talk about it in terms of Newtonian concepts, many

of which are really not compatible with quantum mechanics. The famous Bohr-Einstein

debate, in a way, has never ended; such has been the pursuit of a ‘classical’ theory behind

quantum mechanics. Statements about quantum physics being counter-intuitive, for exam-

ple, are commonly seen and believed by many. We tell our students that the quantum world

is impossible to make sense of. Quantum mechanics gives only probabilistic predictions.

The thesis presented here is that some, if not all, of those beliefs may simply be the result

of our reluctance to take the necessary quantum jump in our fundamental perspective, and

our indulgence in Newtonian concepts. The latter is not really any more intuitive than the

modiﬁed versions suggested by quantum mechanics, only more familiar. A key concept, and

the main focus here, is that of space or position. The perspective here is that quantum

mechanics should be looked at as a dynamical theory for physical entities in space, which

is really quantum instead of classical. The position as a dynamical variable is not real-

valued because a quantum space cannot be modeled on a continuum of points as in classical

commutative geometry, at least not a ﬁnite dimensional one [1].

The idea of a quantum geometry is certainly not new; however, we are talking here about

a picture of that quantum space completely at the level of simple, textbook, so-called non-

relativistic quantum mechanics. Moreover, we will justify it and illustrate explicitly how

the classical Newtonian picture is retrieved in the classical approximation. The formulation

presented here is based on relativity symmetries and symmetry contractions.

II. SIMPLE QUANTUM MECHANICS FROM A RELATIVITY SYMMETRY

Let us look at the mathematical formulation ﬁrst, and leave issues with the conceptual

perspective to be discussed below. With justiﬁcation for the terminology to be addressed

2

later, we consider a (partial) relativity symmetry for simple quantum mechanics as being

given by the Lie algebra with the following nonzero commutators

[Jij, Jhk] = i(δjkJih − δjhJik + δihJjk − δikJjh) ,

[Xi, Pj] = iδijI ,

[Jij, Pk] = i(δjkPi − δikPj) ,

[Jij, Xk] = i(δjkXi − δikXj) ,

(1)

with indices going from 1 to 3. We could have included an eleventh generator H with only

one nonzero commutator: [Xi, H] = −iPi. The full algebra would then just be the nontrivial

U(1) central extension of the algebra for the Galilean group, for which the Xi are usually

denoted by Ki and interpreted as generators for the Galilean boosts. In fact, that symmetry

has been used as the starting point for the quantization of Newtonian particle physics [2].

The Ki, as observables, indeed give the (mass times) position, while the central extension

is what allows for the Heisenberg commutation relation. The Hamiltonian H has no role

to play in the kinematical descriptions here, nor is including it much of a problem. Our

reluctance to do so has deeper reasons beyond the scope of the present paper [3]. Note that

without H we do have a closed subalgebra. We denote by HR(3) the symmetry generated by

this subalgebra, a three dimensional Heisenberg(-Weyl) symmetry with rotations included.

As we will illustrate below, representations of this symmetry describe the quantum space,

or the conﬁguration space, as well as the phase space for a quantum ‘particle’ with no spin.

We start with the coset space representation obtained by factoring out the SO(3) sub-

group. The explicit form of a generic inﬁnitesimal transformation is given by

is, in a way, the counterpart of the phase space for Newtonian mechanics, written as a coset

space. The fact that the representation is not unitary, however, is not what we want for

quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, it is closely related to the quantum phase space.

The Heisenberg subalgebra generated by {Xi, Pi, I} is an invariant one. Note that by

taking out the central charge generator I one does not even have a subalgebra. We start

3

with the familiar coherent state representation

where

eiθ(cid:12)(cid:12)pi, xi(cid:11) = U(pi, xi, θ) |0i

(4)

and |0i ≡ |0, 0i is a ﬁducial normalized vector, ˆXi and ˆPi are representations of the generators

Xi and Pi as Hermitian operators on the Hilbert space spanned by the six parameter set of
vectors |pi, xii, and ˆI is the identity operator representing the central generator I. (pi, xi, θ)

corresponds to a generic element of the (Heisenberg-Weyl) subgroup as

W (pi, xi, θ) = exp i(piXi − xiPi + θI)

with

W (p′i, x′i, θ′)W (pi, xi, θ) = W(cid:18)p′i + pi, x′i + xi, θ′ + θ −

x′ipi − p′ixi

(cid:19) ,

(5)

(6)

where x′ipi − p′ixi is the classical mechanical symplectic form [4, 5] . This is an inﬁnite-

dimensional unitary representation. The Hilbert space, or rather its projective counterpart,

is the phase space for the quantum mechanics. The projective Hilbert space is, in fact,

an inﬁnite-dimensional symplectic manifold. Note that pi and xi, as labels of the coherent
states, correspond to expectation values, but not eigenvalues of the ˆPi and ˆXi observables.

The coherent states give an overcomplete basis, with overlap given by

For ﬁxed (pi, xi, θ), the above gives a generic element of the coset with the Ri

j as elements
of the SO(3) subgroup. The ﬁducial vector |0, 0i corresponds to (0, 0, 0, 1)t which is taken

by any such coset onto (pi, xi, θ, 1)t corresponding to eiθ |pi, xii. This illustrates explicitly

the U(pi, xi, θ) action of the Heisenberg-Weyl subgroup, and in fact also its extension to the

full group on the Hilbert space, as depicted on the coset space. Each transformation of the

unitary representation sends a coherent state to another coherent state and hence its action

can be depicted in the coset space with elements of the latter mapped to the coherent states.

We can take a diﬀerent coset space representation by factoring out an ISO(3) subgroup

generated by the Xi and Jij. The inﬁnitesimal representation is then given by

(10)

The (xi, θ) space is the quantum counterpart for the coset space that describes Newtonian

(conﬁguration) space. We can also construct a unitary representation whose relation to

the coset is the same as the above for the phase space. The Pi and I generators give

group elements matching to the points in the coset space, and also generates an invariant

subalgebra, which is, however, trivial. This can also be seen in the corresponding group

structure, i.e. by deﬁning

we obtain

W ′(xi, θ) = exp(−xiPi + θI) ,

W ′(x′i, θ′)W ′(xi, θ) = W ′(x′i + xi, θ′ + θ) .

(11)

(12)

We have a picture here very similar to the coherent state representation above with basis

vectors labeled by the coset coordinates xi such that

eiθ(cid:12)(cid:12)xi(cid:11) = U′(xi, θ) |0i

5

(13)

where

U′(xi, θ) ≡ eiθ ˆI e−ixi ˆPi ,

(14)

|0i is the ﬁducial normalized vector, and ˆPi and ˆI Hermitian operators on the Hilbert
space spanned by the three parameter set of |xii vectors. Much the same as before, ˆPi
generates translations in xi, while ˆI is the identity operator eﬀectively generating only a

phase rotation of a vector |xii. Following the coset action, we can see again the action of the
unitary representation for the full group of HR(3). In particular, we see that eipi ˆXieiθ |xii =
ei(pixi+θ) |xii, thus illustrating that the vectors |xii are eigenvectors of the position operators.

The latter is mathematically the same as the position eigenstates in the usual description of

quantum mechanics. For quantum mechanics, the unitary representation constructed here

from the coset space describes the quantum analog of the free particle conﬁguration space, or

the physical space, along the lines of the phase space construction. It is however equivalent

to that of the latter as a Hilbert space.

III. NEWTONIAN LIMIT FROM A SYMMETRY CONTRACTION

A naive way of interpreting the coset representations given above as quantum analogs

of the classical (conﬁguration) space and phase space is suggested by simply replacing the

generator I by 0 and dropping the variable θ from consideration. A symmetry contraction,

however, gives a solid mathematical way to formulate the classical theory as an approxima-

tion to the quantum theory.

Consider the contraction [6] of the above Lie algebra, given by the k → ∞ limit under

the rescaled generators X c

i = 1

k Xi and P c

i = 1

k Pi. The J-P c and J-X c commutators are the

same as those of J-P and J-X; however, we have

[X c

i , P c

j ] =

i
k2

δijI → 0 ,

(15)

giving the (commuting) classical position and momentum. The contracted Lie algebra gives,

with the H generator included, the Galilean relativity symmetry with a trivial central exten-

sion in which I is decoupled, as we will explain explicitly below. What we will demonstrate

here is that the symmetry contraction applied to the above representations also gives exactly

the classical phase space, as well as the Newtonian space.

The algebra element should ﬁrst be written in terms of the rescaled generators as
c = k ¯pi
2 ωijJij + ¯pi
c = k¯xi are to be taken as ﬁnite even at the k → ∞ limit. They are then parameters
of the contracted algebra. The coset space of (pi, xi, θ) should be described in terms of

which gives only dθ = ¯θ in the limit. Hence, θ becomes an absolute parameter not aﬀected

(17)

We can also apply the symmetry contraction to the unitary representations on the Hilbert

space(s). We ﬁrst look at the latter as a representation of the algebra of observable based
on ˆX c

i (and ˆI) at ﬁnite k. The set of |pi, xii states should be re-labeled as |˜pc

i and ˆP c

with the ˜pc

i and ˜xc

i characterizing the expectation values of ˆX c

i and ˆP c

i . Note that ˜pc

i , ˜xc

i and ˜xc

do not directly correspond to the pi

where the state overlap has the second, real and negative exponential factor, written in

terms of ˜p′c
limit, so long as the coherent states are not the same. Hence, we can see that ˆP c

i and

i corresponding to the eigenvalues for the then simultaneous

i are diagonal with ˜pc

i and ˜xc

7

i , ˜xc

eigenstate |˜pc
and that of the algebra of observables described as functions (or polynomials) of ˆP c

i i. The Hilbert space, as a representation for the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry
i and ˆX c
i ,
is therefore reducible. It reduces to a direct sum of one-dimensional representations of the

ray spaces of each |˜pc

i , ˜xc

i i. That is to say, the only admissible states are the exact coherent

states, and not any linear combinations. These are really the classical states, though we

are not used to describing classical mechanics in the Hilbert space language. Actually, this

kind of description has been available for a long time [7]. The latter may be particularly

useful in establishing the more involved dynamical picture of what we discussed here. Note
that ˆH c and ˆJ c

ij as classical observables would also be diagonal on |˜pc

i i. However, in the

i , ˜xc

contracted symmetry algebra, the generators Jij (and H) are not to be rescaled by k, and

maintain all their nonzero commutators. The transformations they generate still take one

state to another, as they should in the classical picture. As they always take a coherent

state to a coherent state anyway, they do not support linear combinations either. Readers

may ﬁnd interest in an explicit expression of the generator for dynamical/time evolution on

the Hilbert space of |˜pc

i , ˜xc

i i states in terms of the classical Hamiltonian [7].

The story for the contraction of Hilbert space as the quantum space is somewhat less

obvious. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of transformations in the W ′ group. But we

know that the space serves as a representation for the Heisenberg algebra, and hence the
algebra of observables, on which the action of the ˆPi operators for the momentum observables
have eigenstates being linear combinations of the basis |xii states.

It is exactly for such

consideration of momentum dependent observables that one needs to go beyond the coset to

the full Hilbert space. At the contraction limit, however, the Heisenberg algebra is trivialized.
ˆP c
i commuting with ˆX c
labeled by the ˆX c

i means that they have to share the same eigenvectors |˜xc

i eigenvalues. Again the Hilbert space as a representation for the algebra

i i, now

of observables reduces and only the latter vectors are relevant, not linear combinations or

even the phases. The result is the Newtonian three dimensional space.

Readers should have realized that our rescaling parameter k for the implementation of the

symmetry contraction corresponds to 1
√¯h

, so that the contraction is really the ¯h → 0 limit.

The latter of course corresponds to taking the classical approximation. In fact, the quantum

symmetry algebra is quite commonly written with an ¯h within each commutator. Our version

ﬁrst refers to the natural quantum units of ¯h = 1, in which the Jij are dimensionless. The
contraction limit is obtained as described, which is the same as taking only the ¯h in the ˆX c- ˆP c

8

commutator to zero. Otherwise, all commutators would be killed. If one is taking the algebra

as describing relations among the classical observables, this is great; however, considering it

as the relativity symmetry algebra, this is a disaster. The algebra of observables is really not
the one for the relativity, but rather the algebra of functions of ˆX c and ˆP c. Nevertheless,

we still need the nonzero ¯h in the relativity algebra to have Jij (and H) being described
in the classical units, if we want to match them to the observables ˆJ c
ij and ˆH c. However,
generators of the relativity symmetry are not to be identiﬁed with the operators representing

the observables in the Hilbert space picture of classical mechanics [7]. The contraction is not

concerned with the units. In the classical picture after the contraction, it is no longer un-

natural to have units for position and momentum chosen as independent, hence their product

having a nontrivial unit. That unit would have fundamental signiﬁcance in telling when the

classical theory is a good approximation to the better quantum theory. The contraction is

a mathematical procedure for getting the approximate theory characterized by a small scale

[6]. The classical scale is the one which is small compared to the contraction parameter k,

hence with smallness described by the ¯h value. ¯h serves as the fundamental unit with which

we re-express physical quantities.

The coset space pictures at least illustrate well that the quantum space is diﬀerent from

the Newtonian space in much the same way as the quantum phase space is diﬀerent from

the classical one. The analysis of the inﬁnite dimensional unitary representations and their

contractions further gives the full, solid results.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We physicists should not endow a vague common sense concept like physical space with

any mathematical model as a given. We are supposed to learn from experiments what consti-

tutes a good/correct theoretical/mathematical model of any physical concept, and physical

space should not be an exception. We have by now roughly a century of experimental re-

sults saying that the classical/Newtonian model of the physical space does not serve this

purpose so well, especially not as the conﬁguration space of particle motion. We should not

be reluctant to modify it. It is known that the projective Hilbert space as the true quantum

phase space is an inﬁnite dimensional symplectic manifold. It is reasonable to think about

a Lagrangian submanifold of that as the quantum conﬁguration space. What could the

9

notion of (classical/Newtonian) space, described in any inertial frame, be other than the

conﬁguration space of (free) particle motion under arbitrary initial condition? What kind

of coordinates would be more natural for the space other than the xi variables as the angle

coordinates, with pi as action ones, for free particle motion as described on the phase space?

Looking at the physical space as it could possibly be understood from practical physics, the

space of all xi values as conﬁguration variables is essentially the only picture we should have,

so long as nonrelativistic ‘particle’ mechanics, classical or quantum, are concerned. Finding

the inﬁnite conﬁguration variables from the projective Hilbert space is highly nontrivial.

What we presented here, however, looks like a sensible Hilbert space version of it. This is

the ﬁrst step in justifying a new perspective regarding the (quantum) physical space, the

adoption of which may also help clarify some issues in quantum physics and beyond. The

analysis here is simple and straightforward with results hardly totally new or unexpected.

What is new and important is the way they are pieced together consistently to illustrate the

basic perspective which suggests looking at the familiar notions in quantum mechanics in a

very diﬀerent way.

Symmetry is the single most important organizing principle in the theory of modern

physics. What we performed in the above analysis is an attempt to see how the fundamental

symmetry of something like free particle motion informs us about the nature of the phase

space, conﬁguration space, and hence our physical space. These types of symmetries are

relativity symmetries. Diﬀerent fundamental theories have diﬀerent relativity symmetries

which correspond to diﬀerent pictures of physical space and time, just like Einstein (special)

relativity gives a Minkowski spacetime. In fact, the mathematical relation of the latter to

the Newtonian one can be described exactly using the corresponding coset space picture as

representations of the relativity symmetries through the symmetry contraction with c as the

parameter [8, 9]. The contraction is really the mathematical way to describe the Newtonian

limit as an approximation to the better Einstein or quantum theory. We give the analog

mathematical description of the quantum to classical case here and use it to illustrate a

picture of the quantum space. In this case, the ¯h or rather 1
√¯h

takes the place of c.

Our group has introduced the notion of a quantum relativity for deep microscopic quan-

tum spacetime [10], from much the same theoretical perspective as what is behind the

current analysis. The basic starting point there is the old idea of relativity deformations

[12] to which contraction of the relativity symmetries is the reverse process. While we have

10

presented some picture of the physics from a sequence of contractions [9], we are currently

working on details of the descriptions of an alternative contraction scheme that naturally
incorporates the symmetries like HR(3) and ˜G(3), and the results here are really part of

that. The ‘ﬁnal’ symmetry is considered to have non-commuting Xi and Pi [10, 11], to

the spacetime of which no real number picture is expected to work. Under the domain of

simple quantum mechanics investigated here, the physical space picture still looks like a real

manifold but of inﬁnite dimension.

We have not touched on the measurement problem so far. A couple of comments on the

issue are in order. To the extent that we do not have any dynamical theory to describe

a measurement process [13], our leaving the issues on the sideline is justiﬁed. We sure do

not see the quantum space picture here as, in any sense, ‘ﬁnal’, and we do not aim at

describing measurements. We want to note, however, that most, if not all, discussions about

measurements are really about classical measurements, as Bohr did a good job in elaborating.

They are about extracting pieces of classical information, as represented by numbers, from a

quantum system. It is not surprising that the nature of the information/physical attributes

of the system being quantum does not ﬁt in well with such measurements. If the quantum

position is to be described by inﬁnitely many real numbers, our decision to ‘get’ a one

or three real number reading leads to the so-called probabilistic results. Only statistics

from many such measurements can give a better approximation of those inﬁnite coordinate

values. Actually, we essentially only obtain values of any measurements by comparison. For

example, position or distance between two positions is measured by comparing it to a length

standard, admitting some uncertainty. The nature of that ‘ratio’ being a piece of classical

information, a real number, is never more than a mathematical model or an assumption.

With development of quantum information theory, physicists in the future may be proﬁcient

in handling quantum information and true quantum measurements may then be the rule,

rather than the exception. We would like to advance the notion of measurements as possibly

extracting quantum, non-real-number, information from a system which describes some of

its properties. Even the idea of a ‘deﬁnite’ position in the physical quantum space may

plausible be useful for the kind of position information. However, we are certainly not

defending the classical notion of being able to extract full information about a dynamical

state without disturbing it at all. It is not our intent either to take any stand in a kind of

philosophical debate about realism here, which we see as beyond, and not at all necessary

11
