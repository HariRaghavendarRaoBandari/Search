THE INDUCTIVE BLOCKWISE ALPERIN WEIGHT CONDITION

FOR G2(q) AND 3D4(q)

FB Mathematik, TU Kaiserslautern, Postfach 3049, 67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany.

ELISABETH SCHULTE

Abstract. The inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition is a system of conditions
whose veriﬁcation for all non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups would imply the blockwise
Alperin weight conjecture. We establish this condition for the groups G2(q), q > 5, and
3D4(q) for all primes dividing their order.

1. Introduction

The Alperin weight conjecture relates for a prime ℓ information about a ﬁnite group
G (global ) to properties of ℓ-local subgroups of G, that is, normalizers of ℓ-subgroups of
G (local ). For this reason it is called a global-local conjecture. Here, an ℓ-weight of G is
a pair (R, ψ), where R is an ℓ-subgroup of G and ψ is an irreducible complex character
of the normalizer NG(R) containing R in its kernel such that ψ is of ℓ-defect zero when
regarded as a character of NG(R)/R. The group G acts on the set of its ℓ-weights by
conjugation. Alperin’s conjecture asserts the following:

Conjecture 1 (Alperin, 1986 [1, p. 369]). Let G be a ﬁnite group and ℓ a prime. The
number of G-conjugacy classes of ℓ-weights of G equals the number of its irreducible Brauer
characters deﬁned over characteristic ℓ.

Via Brauer block induction each ℓ-weight of G may be assigned to a unique ℓ-block of
G by calling an ℓ-weight (R, ψ) a B-weight if the ℓ-block of NG(R) containing ψ induces
the ℓ-block B of G. The blockwise Alperin weight conjecture then reads as follows:

Conjecture 2 (Alperin, 1986 [1, p. 371]). Let G be a ﬁnite group, ℓ a prime and B an
ℓ-block of G. The number of irreducible Brauer characters in B coincides with the number
of G-conjugacy classes of B-weights of G.

Even though Alperin’s (blockwise) weight conjecture has been veriﬁed in many partic-
ular instances, it has not been possible so far to ﬁnd a general proof for arbitrary ﬁnite
groups. However, in recent years there has been considerable progress towards a solution
for this question, the central focus of this development being a reduction of the original

problem to a question on ﬁnite (quasi-) simple groups. A reduction theorem for the block-
free version of Alperin’s conjecture was obtained by Navarro–Tiep in 2011 [28]. They give
an inductive proof showing that if all ﬁnite simple groups satisfy the so-called inductive
Alperin weight condition, then Alperin’s weight conjecture holds for any ﬁnite group. In
2013, Späth [35] reﬁned this result to achieve a reduction theorem for the blockwise ver-
sion along with a corresponding system of inductive conditions, the inductive blockwise
Alperin weight condition (iBAW) (cf. Deﬁnition 2.7).

The iBAW condition for a prime ℓ has already been proven to hold for many of the 26
sporadic groups [7]. Moreover, Malle gave its veriﬁcation in [24] for the simple alternating
groups as well as for the Suzuki and Ree groups of types 2B2, 2G2 and 2F4. Späth proved
it in [35] for ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type deﬁned over characteristic ℓ, and together
with Koshitani in [21, 22] for ℓ-blocks of cyclic defect. Apart from some special cases,
the problem of establishing the iBAW condition for ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type for
all primes dividing their order is still open for types other than 2B2, 2G2 and 2F4. Our
results are the following:

Theorem A. Let q > 5 be a prime power. The inductive blockwise Alperin weight condi-
tion (cf. Deﬁnition 2.7) holds for the group G2(q) and every prime ℓ dividing its order.

(For the groups G2(3) and G2(4) with exceptional Schur multipliers, Breuer [7] veriﬁed

the iBAW condition by means of computational methods.)

Theorem B. Let q be a prime power. The inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition
(cf. Deﬁnition 2.7) holds for the group 3D4(q) and every prime ℓ dividing its order.

This work grew out of the author’s dissertation [31] prepared at the University of

Kaiserslautern under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Gunter Malle.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. General Notation. Let G be a ﬁnite group. Concerning the block and character
theory of G we follow the notation of [27]. We denote by Irr(G) and IBrℓ(G) the sets of
irreducible complex characters and of irreducible Brauer characters of G with respect to
a prime ℓ, respectively. For a subgroup H 6 G and ϑ ∈ Irr(H) ∪ IBrℓ(H) we let IndG
H(ϑ)
or ϑG denote the character of G induced by ϑ, and we write ResG
H(ψ) or ψ|H for the
restriction of ψ ∈ Irr(G) ∪ IBrℓ(G) to H. For ϑ ∈ Irr(H) (or ϑ ∈ IBrℓ(H)) we denote by
Irr(G | ϑ) (or IBrℓ(G | ϑ)) the set of irreducible (Brauer) characters of G lying above ϑ.
The set of ℓ-blocks of G (with defect group D) will be denoted by Blℓ(G) (respectively
Blℓ(G | D)), and for B ∈ Blℓ(G) we set Irr(B) := Irr(G) ∩ B and IBr(B) := IBrℓ(G) ∩ B.
For a (Brauer) character ψ ∈ Irr(G) ∪ IBrℓ(G) we denote by bl(ψ) the ℓ-block of G
containing ψ, and for an ℓ-block b of a subgroup of G we denote by bG the induced ℓ-block
of G if deﬁned.

Group actions play a major role here. If X is a set with a ﬁnite group A acting on it,
then for x ∈ X, a ∈ A and X ′ ⊆ X we denote by ax = a. x, xa = a−1. x the images of a
applied to x from left and right, respectively, Ax the stabilizer of x in A, aX ′ the image
of X ′ under a, X ′a the image of X ′ under a−1, AX ′ the setwise stabilizer of X ′ in A. If
AX ′ acts on a set Y , then we denote by AX ′,y the stabilizer of y ∈ Y in AX ′.

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

If A acts on the ﬁnite group G by automorphisms, then there is an induced action of
A on the set Irr(G) of irreducible characters of G via χa(g) = χ(a.g) for χ ∈ Irr(G) and
a ∈ A. Analogously, one obtains an action of A on IBrℓ(G) for every prime ℓ.

From now, p will be a prime number. Moreover, we denote by F the algebraic closure
of a ﬁeld consisting of p elements, and for an integral power q of p we deﬁne Fq as the
unique subﬁeld of F consisting of q elements.

2.2. Alperin’s Conjecture and its Reduction to Finite Simple Groups. Here
we consider certain aspects of the weight conjecture and its reduction. Throughout, G
denotes a ﬁnite group and ℓ is a prime.

Deﬁnition 2.1. An ℓ-subgroup R 6 G is called a radical ℓ-subgroup of G if it satisﬁes
R = Oℓ(NG(R)). We also say that R is (ℓ-) radical in G. The set of radical ℓ-subgroups
of G will be denoted by Radℓ(G).

Lemma 2.2. If (R, ϕ) is an ℓ-weight of G, then R is a radical ℓ-subgroup of G.

Proof. The ℓ-block of NG(R)/R containing ϕ is of ℓ-defect zero and by [27, Thm. 4.8] the
ℓ-core Oℓ(NG(R)/R) is contained in any defect group of any ℓ-block of NG(R)/R.
(cid:3)

By [2, p. 3] the B-weights of G may be constructed in the following manner:

Construction 2.3. Let B be an ℓ-block of G. For a radical ℓ-subgroup R of G and an
ℓ-block b ∈ Blℓ(R CG(R) | R) with bG = B we denote by θ the canonical character of b.
Then for every ψ ∈ Irr(NG(R)θ | θ) with

the pair

ψ(1)ℓ
θ(1)ℓ

= | NG(R)θ : R CG(R)|ℓ

(R, IndNG(R)
NG(R)θ

(ψ))

constitutes a B-weight of G. As a result of Cliﬀord correspondence (e.g. [17, Thm. 6.11])
distinct characters ψ yield distinct B-weights. Letting R run over a complete set of
representatives for the G-conjugacy classes of radical ℓ-subgroups of G, and for each such
R letting b run over a complete set of representatives for the NG(R)-conjugacy classes of
ℓ-blocks b ∈ Blℓ(R CG(R) | R) with bG = B provides all B-weights of G.

In general there can be various types of radical ℓ-subgroups giving rise to ℓ-weights
belonging to an ℓ-block B. However, if B is an ℓ-block of abelian defect, then the situation
is more restrictive. Compare [4, pp. 24/25] for the following:

Lemma 2.4. Let B be an ℓ-block of G of abelian defect. If (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G,
then R is a defect group of B.

There are several versions of the iBAW condition. Apart from the original one by Späth
[35, Def. 4.1] there is also a version treating only blocks with defect groups involved in
certain sets of ℓ-groups [35, Def. 5.17], or a version handling single blocks [21, Def. 3.2].
We shall consider the inductive condition for a single block. For a non-abelian ﬁnite simple
group this condition may then be veriﬁed block by block, this way proving the original
inductive condition for the whole group. Note that due to the nature of the groups
considered here we restrict the deﬁnition of the iBAW condition to the case of simple

4

groups with cyclic outer automorphism group. The deﬁnition of the iBAW condition for
the general case may be found in [21, Def. 3.2].

Notation 2.5. Let G be a ﬁnite group and ℓ be a prime.

(i) If Q is a radical ℓ-subgroup of G and B an ℓ-block of G, then we deﬁne the set

dz(NG(Q)/Q, B) := {χ ∈ Irr(NG(Q)/Q) of ℓ-defect zero | bl(χ)G = B},

where χ is regarded as a character of NG(Q) in the expression bl(χ)G.

(ii) By Radℓ(G)/ ∼G we denote a complete system of representatives for the G-conjugacy

classes of radical ℓ-subgroups of G.

Deﬁnition 2.6 ([21, Def. 3.2], [35, Lemma 6.1]). Let S be a ﬁnite non-abelian simple
group such that Aut(S)/S is cyclic and let X be the universal ℓ′-covering group of S.
Let B be an ℓ-block of X. We say that the inductive blockwise Alperin weight (iBAW)
condition holds for B if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) There exist subsets IBr(B | Q) ⊆ IBr(B) for Q ∈ Radℓ(X) with the following

properties:
(1) IBr(B | Q)a = IBr(B | Qa) for every Q ∈ Radℓ(X), a ∈ Aut(X)B,

(2) IBr(B) = ˙SQ∈Radℓ(X)/∼X

(ii) For every Q ∈ Radℓ(X) there exists a bijection

IBr(B | Q).

such that ΩX

ΩX
Q (φ)a = ΩX

Q : IBr(B | Q) −→ dz(NX(Q)/Q, B)
Qa(φa) for every φ ∈ IBr(B | Q) and a ∈ Aut(X)B.

Deﬁnition 2.7 (iBAW condition for S and ℓ with Aut(S)/S cyclic). Let S be a ﬁnite non-
abelian simple group such that Aut(S)/S is cyclic and let X be the universal ℓ′-covering
group of S. We say that the inductive blockwise Alperin weight (iBAW) condition holds
for S and ℓ if the iBAW condition holds for every ℓ-block of X.

Remark 2.8. Note that for S, ℓ and X as above Späth gives a slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition
of the iBAW condition for S and ℓ in [35, Def. 4.1]. However, the conditions demanded
there immediately imply those stated in Deﬁnition 2.7, and vice versa, by [21, Lemma 3.3]
the iBAW condition holds for S and ℓ in the sense of Späth if it holds for some Aut(X)-
transversal in Blℓ(X) in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.6. Thus, both deﬁnitions are equivalent.

We call a group K involved in a ﬁnite group H if there exist subgroups H1 E H2 ≤ H
such that K ∼= H2/H1. Due to the following theorem by Späth [35, Thm. A] there is great
interest in verifying the iBAW condition for all ﬁnite non-abelian simple groups:

Theorem 2.9 (Späth). Let G be a ﬁnite group. If all non-abelian simple groups involved
in G satisfy the iBAW condition for ℓ, then Conjecture 2 holds for every ℓ-block of G.

Notation 2.10. Let B be an ℓ-block of a ﬁnite group X.

(i) For a radical ℓ-subgroup Q ∈ Radℓ(X) we set

Irr0(NX(Q)) := {ψ ∈ Irr(NX (Q)) | Q ⊆ ker(ψ), ψ(1)ℓ = | NX (Q)/Q |ℓ},

Irr0(NX (Q), B) := {ψ ∈ Irr0(NX(Q)) | bl(ψ)X = B}.

(ii) For an ℓ-weight (Q, ψ) we denote by [(Q, ψ)]X its X-conjugacy class.

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

(iii) The set of X-conjugacy classes of B-weights of X will be denoted by W(B).

Lemma 2.11. Let X be a ﬁnite group and suppose that for an ℓ-block B of X we have a
bijection

ΩB : IBr(B) −→ W(B)

satisfying ΩB(χ)a = ΩB(χa) for all χ ∈ IBr(B) and a ∈ Aut(X)B. We set

IBr(B | Q) :=

{Ω−1

B ([(Q, ψ)]X)}

[ψ∈Irr0(NX (Q), B)

for each Q ∈ Radℓ(X) and deﬁne a map

Q : IBr(B | Q) −→ dz(NX(Q)/Q, B), χ 7−→ ^ΩB(χ),
ΩX

where ^ΩB(χ) denotes the unique element in dz(NX (Q)/Q, B) whose inﬂation ψ to NX (Q)
satisﬁes ΩB(χ) = [(Q, ψ)]X . Then for all Q ∈ Radℓ(X) and a ∈ Aut(X)B it holds that

IBr(B | Q)a = IBr(B | Qa)

and we have a disjoint union

IBr(B) =

[Q∈Radℓ(X)/∼X

IBr(B | Q),

so part (i) of Deﬁnition 2.6 is fulﬁlled for the ℓ-block B. Moreover, the map ΩX
deﬁned, bijective, and satisﬁes part (ii) of Deﬁnition 2.6.

Q is well-

Proof. Straightforward.

(cid:3)

For certain cases some important results have already been established: Let S be a

ﬁnite non-abelian simple group and X its universal ℓ′-covering group. Then:

(i) The iBAW condition holds for every ℓ-block of X that has cyclic defect groups, see

[21, Thm. 1.1, Thm. 1.3], [22, Lemma 2.3].

(ii) If S is a group of Lie type deﬁned over a ﬁeld of characteristic ℓ, then the iBAW

condition holds for S and ℓ, see [35, Thm. C].

3. Steinberg Relations for Universal Chevalley Groups

The groups considered here are ﬁnite groups of Lie type consisting of ﬁxed points of
universal Chevalley groups over F under certain Steinberg endomorphisms. Each universal
Chevalley group has a semisimple complex Lie algebra associated to it, along with a root
system Σ. As an abstract group, such a group with Σ 6= A1 is generated by elements
xr(t), r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F×, related to certain automorphisms of the underlying complex Lie
algebra with respect to some Chevalley basis and subject to the relations

xr(t1)xr(t2) = xr(t1 + t2) for t1, t2 ∈ K, r ∈ Σ,

[xr(t), xs(u)] =Yi,j

hr(t1)hr(t2) = hr(t1t2) for t1, t2 ∈ K ×, r ∈ Σ,

xir+js(cijrs(−t)iuj) for linearly independent r, s ∈ Σ, t, u ∈ K,

6

where hr(t) := nr(t)nr(−1) for nr(t) := xr(t)x−r(−t−1)xr(t), the product ranges over all
pairs i, j of positive integers such that ir + js ∈ Σ, and the terms occur in a ﬁxed order
independent of t and u with i + j non-decreasing. The scalars cijrs depend on the chosen
Chevalley basis of the underlying Lie algebra.

Additionally, the generators of a universal Chevalley group obey the relations given in
Theorem 3.1 below, where (_, _) denotes an inner product of the Euclidean vector space
RΣ and hv, wi := 2(v, w)/(v, v) for v, w ∈ RΣ. Moreover, for r ∈ Σ we denote by ωr the
reﬂection along the hyperplane orthogonal to r in RΣ. Since Σ is a root system, it holds
that ωr(s) ∈ Σ for all s ∈ Σ (e.g. [10, Def. 2.1.1]).

Theorem 3.1 (Steinberg relations for universal Chevalley groups). Consider a universal
Chevalley group over F with root system Σ 6= A1 and generators xr(t), r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F, and
nr(t) = xr(t)x−r(−t−1)xr(t), hr(t) = nr(t)nr(−1) for r ∈ Σ and t ∈ F×. The following
relations hold for all r, s ∈ Σ and t, u ∈ F (with t 6= 0 or u 6= 0 whenever appropriate):

(i) [hr(t), hs(u)] = 1;

(ii) if {r1, . . . , rm} is a base in Σ and we set ˇr := 2r/(r, r) for all r ∈ Σ, then

hr(t) =

hri(tci),

mYi=1

where ci ∈ Z are such that ˇr =Pm

i=1 ciˇri;

base in Σ as above;

(iii) Qm

i=1 hri(ti) = 1 if and only if ti = 1 for all 1 6 i 6 m, where {r1, . . . , rm} is a

(iv) hr(t)xs(u)hr(t)−1 = xs(thr,siu);

(v) nr(t)xs(u)nr(t)−1 = xωr(s)(ηr,st−hr,siu) for some sign ηr,s ∈ {±1};

(vi) nr(t)ns(u)nr(t)−1 = nωr(s)(ηr,st−hr,siu) with ηr,s as in (v);

(vii) nr(t)hs(u)nr(t)−1 = hωr(s)(u);

(viii) nr(1)2 = hr(−1).

Proof. Relations (i) and (iv) to (viii) can be found in the proof of [10, Thm. 12.1.1]. The
remaining statements are part of [14, Thm. 1.12.1].
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. The signs ηr,s in Theorem 3.1 are not uniquely determined by the root system
Σ but rather they also depend on the chosen Chevalley basis of the underlying Lie algebra.
However, they are independent of the prime p (cf. the proof of [10, Prop. 6.4.3]).

Let us ﬁrst study the ﬁnite Chevalley groups G2(q) with regard to the iBAW condition.

We begin by providing a brief collection of important properties of these groups.

4. The Groups G2(q)

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

7

4.1. Properties of G2(q). We let q = pf for some natural number f ∈ N>0 and consider
a root system Σ of type G2, that is,

Σ := {±a, ±b, ±(a + b), ±(2a + b), ±(3a + b), ±(3a + 2b)} ⊂ R2,

where Π := {a, b} is a base for Σ (see, e.g., [14, Rmk. 1.8.8]). There are two root lengths
in Σ, with ±b, ±(3a + 2b) and ±(3a + b) being the long roots of Σ.

Let G be a universal Chevalley group over F with root system Σ and Steinberg gener-

ators xr(t), hr(s) and nr(s), r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F, s ∈ F×. The linear map given by

F : G −→ G,

xr(t) 7−→ xr(tq),

r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F,

is the Frobenius endomorphism of G with respect to Fq, hence a Steinberg endomorphism
of G, and G := G2(q) := GF . This group is generated by all xr(t) for r ∈ Σ and t ∈ Fq,
and its order is given by

|G2(q)| = q6Φ1(q)2Φ2(q)2Φ3(q)Φ6(q),

where Φi(X) ∈ Z[X] denotes the i-th cyclotomic polynomial (see [25, Table 24.1]).

Following [25, Table 24.2, Thm. 24.17 and Rmk. 24.19] the group G2(q) is simple for
q > 3, and if q > 5, then G2(q) has trivial Schur multiplier, that is, it is its own universal
covering group. Here, unless stated diﬀerently, we assume that q > 5.

4.1.1. Weyl Group and Maximal Tori of G2(q). Let T be the maximal torus of G gener-
ated by all hr(t), r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F×, and denote by W := NG(T)/ T the corresponding Weyl
group, a dihedral group of order 12.

Notation 4.1. Following [11] we introduce a diﬀerent way of writing the elements of T.
Set ξ1 := a + b, ξ2 := a and ξ3 := −ξ1 − ξ2, which yields

Σ = {±ξ1, ±ξ2, ±ξ3, ±(ξ1 − ξ2), ±(ξ2 − ξ3), ±(ξ3 − ξ1)}.

We consider the additive group ZΣ. By [10, p. 98] each group homomorphism χ : ZΣ → F×
(called an F-character of ZΣ) gives rise to an element h(χ) of the maximal torus T, and
according to [10, Thm. 7.1.1] we have

T = {h(χ) | χ : ZΣ −→ F× is a group homomorphism}.

Since ZΣ is a free abelian group, it is evident that for any ﬁxed basis B ⊆ ZΣ a group
homomorphism χ : ZΣ −→ F× (and hence h(χ)) is uniquely determined by the images of
the basis elements under χ. Now let us ﬁx the basis B = {ξ1, ξ2}. Then we denote by
h(z1, z2, z3) with z1, z2, z3 ∈ F× the element h(χ) of T deﬁned by χ(ξ1) = z1, χ(ξ2) = z2,
and the condition z1z2z3 = 1. We have

for r ∈ Σ and z ∈ F× (see [10, p. 98]).

hr(z) = h(zhr, ξ1i, zhr, ξ2i, zhr, ξ3i)

The notation introduced above allows a uniform description of the action of NG(T),

and hence of W, on T as follows, see [11, p. 193]:
Lemma 4.2. Let z1, z2, z3 ∈ F× with z1z2z3 = 1 and suppose that i, j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3} are
pairwise distinct. Then we have

nξi−ξj (1)−1h(z1, z2, z3)nξi−ξj (1) = h(zπ(1), zπ(2), zπ(3)),

8

nξk(1)−1h(z1, z2, z3)nξk (1) = h(z−1

π(1), z−1

π(2), z−1

π(3)),

where π denotes the transposition (ij) ∈ S3.

Up to G-conjugation there exist six maximal tori in G. Representatives of these in the
algebraic group G are given in Table 1 below (cf. [11, p. 194], [13, p. 507], [19, Table I]),
where we write v2 := nb(1)n−(2a+b)(1), v3 := n3a+b(1)n−b(1) and v6 := v2v3.

For future use we set F+ := F and F− := v2F , and, accordingly, Gε := GFε for ε ∈ {±}
(or ε ∈ {±1} slightly abusing notation). Then G+ = G, and in consequence of Lang–
Steinberg’s theorem [25, Thm. 21.7] the ﬁnite group G− is G-conjugate to G.

4.1.2. Relations in G2(q). Following Remark 3.2 the signs ηr,s for roots r, s ∈ Σ occurring
in the Steinberg relations given in Theorem 3.1 depend on the chosen Chevalley basis
underlying G. By [29, p. 439 and pp. 441/442] there exists a Chevalley basis for the
simple Lie algebra of type G2 underlying G with respect to which the signs ηr,s, r, s ∈ Σ,
are given by Table 2 and the relations ηr,r = −1, ηr,−s = ηr,s and η−r,s = ηr,ωr(s):

For consistency in our future calculations we shall henceforth assume that the generators
xr(t) of G are derived from a Chevalley basis as above. As a ﬁrst observation we obtain

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the claim follows from Theorem 3.1(vi) in combination with Ta-
ble 2. Statements (i) and (ii) are immediate consequences of Lemma 4.2.

Moreover, the following relations hold:

Lemma 4.4. Let t ∈ F (with t 6= 0 in (ii)) and r ∈ Σ. Then

(i) v2xr(t)v−1
(ii) v2nr(t)v−1
In particular, v2 commutes with all nr(1), r ∈ Σ.

2 = x−r(−t),
2 = n−r(−t).

Table 3. Cartan integers for a root system of type G2

Proof. Following [10, p. 40] the Cartan integers are given by hr, si = p(r, s) − q(r, s) for
r, s ∈ Σ with r 6= ±s, where

p(r, s) = max{i > 0 | −jr + s ∈ Σ for all 0 6 j 6 i },

q(r, s) = max{i > 0 |

jr + s ∈ Σ for all 0 6 j 6 i }.

For r = s we clearly have hr, ri = 2. Application of these formulae yields the claim. (cid:3)

4.1.3. Automorphisms of G2(q). The aim of this section is a description of the automor-
phism group of G. By [36, p. 158] the ﬁeld automorphism Fq −→ Fq, a 7−→ ap, induces
an automorphism Fp of the group G = G2(q) via

Fp : G −→ G,

xr(t) 7−→ xr(tp),

r ∈ Σ, t ∈ Fq.

Fp is called a ﬁeld automorphism of G. Its order in Aut(G) is given by f .

10

In the case that p = 3 we may deﬁne another automorphism of G: By [36, p. 156] there
exists a unique angle-preserving and length-changing bijection ρ : Σ −→ Σ satisfying
ρ(∆) = ∆. Now ρ induces an automorphism Γ of G2(q) via

Γ : G −→ G,

xr(t) 7−→(xρ(r)(ǫrt)

xρ(r)(ǫrt3)

if r is long,
if r is short,

for suitable signs ǫr ∈ {±1} with ǫr = 1 if one of ±r is contained in ∆ (compare [36,
pp. 156/157]). This automorphism is called a graph automorphism of G.

Remark 4.6. Assume again that p = 3. The signs ǫr in the deﬁnition of Γ depend, like
the signs ηr,s, on the chosen Chevalley basis of the Lie algebra underlying G. Since we
are working with the ﬁxed Chevalley basis introduced in Section 4.1.2, the question arises
of determining the values of the signs ǫr with respect to this particular basis. Denote the
elements of this Chevalley basis by hr, r ∈ Π, and er, r ∈ Σ, with [ere−r] = hr, and for
r, s ∈ Σ let Nr,s ∈ Z be the integer satisfying [eres] = Nr,ser+s. Following the proof of
[10, Prop. 12.4.1] we may assume that the signs ǫr equal 1 for all r ∈ Σ if the following
condition on the multiplication constants is satisﬁed:

−

1
2

Nξ2,ξ1 =

1
3

Nξ2,−ξ3 = Nξ1−ξ2,ξ2−ξ3.

By [29, p. 439 and pp. 441/442] we have Nξ2,ξ1 = −2, Nξ2,−ξ3 = 3 and Nξ1−ξ2,ξ2−ξ3 = 1,
whence the above condition is clearly fulﬁlled. Thus, in the following we work with the
graph automorphism

Γ : G −→ G,

xr(t) 7−→(xρ(r)(t)

xρ(r)(t3)

if r is long,
if r is short.

Observe that since ρ2 is the identity map on Σ and ρ interchanges root lengths, we have

Γ2(xr(t)) = xr(t3) for all r ∈ Σ, so Γ2 = F3 = Fp.

Easy calculations yield the following:

Lemma 4.7. Suppose that p = 3. Then for every r ∈ Σ and every t ∈ F×

q we have

(i) Γ(nr(t)) = nρ(r)(tλr ),
(ii) Γ(hr(t)) = hρ(r)(tλr ),
where λr = 1 if r is long, λr = 3 if r is short.

The automorphism group of G may now be described as follows:

Proposition 4.8. For G = G2(q) with q = pf one has

Aut(G) =(G ⋊ hFpi

G ⋊ hΓi

if p 6= 3,
if p = 3.

In particular, the outer automorphism group of G is cyclic for all primes p.

Proof. This is well-known and follows, e.g., from [14, Thm. 2.5.12(a)–(e)] by taking into
account that the algebraic group G is both adjoint and universal (cf. [25, Table 9.2]). (cid:3)

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

Remark 4.9. (i) Inside the group G− = Gv2F the maximal tori of type T− have a represen-
tative lying in the maximal torus T of G (cf. Table 1), which allows for a nice description
of the action of the ﬁeld automorphism on this torus. For this we note that as for the
group G+ the endomorphism of G deﬁned by xr(t) 7→ xr(tp) induces an automorphism
of G−. Similarly as for G+ we denote this automorphism by Fp, and if p 6= 3, then
Aut(G−) = hG−, Fpi. The action of Fp on the maximal torus T− of G− is then given by
raising each element to its p-th power, which is analogous to the action of Fp on the maxi-
mal torus T+ of G+. The order of Fp is given by 2f in this case since (v2Fq)2 = Fq2 = F 2f
p
acts trivially on G−, while F f

p = Fq acts on G− by conjugation with v2.

(ii) Following its deﬁnition, for δ ∈ {±} the ﬁeld automorphism Fp acts trivially on

NGδ(T)/Tδ = NGFδ (T)/ TFδ = hTδ, nr(1) | r ∈ Σi/Tδ

∼= D12,

where we have NGFδ (T) = hTδ, nr(1) | r ∈ Σi by Lemma 4.4. Furthermore, any element of
NGδ(T) may be written in the form n · t for some t ∈ Tδ and n ∈ NGδ (T) with Fp(n) = n.

4.1.4. Blocks of G2(q). The ℓ-blocks and ℓ-decomposition numbers of G have been de-
scribed by Hiß and Shamash in a series of papers for various primes ℓ. The case ℓ > 5 is
not considered here since in this situation the iBAW condition has already been proven
to hold for G, see the proof of Theorem A.

If q is odd, then by [16] the 2-blocks of G may be divided into the following classes:
the principal 2-block B0, the 2-block B3 (only for 3 ∤ q), the 2-blocks of types B1a, B1b,
B2a, B2b, of types BX1, BX2, BXa, BXb, and those of 2-defect zero, where the 2-blocks of
non-cyclic defect are exactly B0, B3 (if 3 ∤ q), and those of types B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b, BX1
and BX2 (cf. also [4, p. 36]).

For 3 ∤ q, by [15] the 3-blocks of G2(q) are given by the principal 3-block B0, the 3-block
B2 (only for 2 ∤ q), the 3-blocks of types B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b, of types BX1, BX3, BXa, BXb
if q ≡ 1 mod 3 or of types BX2, BX6, BXa, BXb if q ≡ −1 mod 3, and those of 3-defect
zero, where the 3-blocks of non-cyclic defect are exactly B1, B2 (if q is odd) and those of
types Bδa, Bδb and BXδ , where δ = 1 if q ≡ 1 mod 3 and δ = 2 if q ≡ −1 mod 3.

4.2. Action of Automorphisms. We are interested in the action of the automorphisms
of G on its irreducible Brauer characters as well as on its ℓ-weights in the cases ℓ = 2
and ℓ = 3, where ℓ ∤ q. By Proposition 4.8 it suﬃces to understand the behaviour of the
Brauer characters and weights of G under the action of Fp if 3 ∤ q or Γ if 3 | q.

4.2.1. Action on the Brauer Characters of G2(q). Using simple arguments on the degrees
of the irreducible (Brauer) characters of G, the unitriangularity of the corresponding
decomposition matrices and certain character values on unipotent elements, we proved
the following in [31, Prop. 12.1, 12.2]:

Proposition 4.10. Let B be a 2-block of G and assume that q is odd. Then one of the
following holds:

(i) B 6= B0 and Aut(G)B acts trivially on IBr(B),
(ii) B = B0, 3 ∤ q, and Aut(G)B = Aut(G) acts trivially on IBr(B),
(iii) B = B0, 3 | q, and Γ interchanges exactly two irreducible Brauer characters in B

and leaves the remaining elements of IBr(B) invariant.

12

Proposition 4.11. Let B be a 3-block of G and assume that 3 ∤ q. Then Aut(G)B acts
trivially on IBr(B).

4.2.2. Action on the Weights of G2(q). The ℓ-weights of G for blocks of non-cyclic defect
have been determined by An [4] for various primes ℓ. We summarize his results for
ℓ ∈ {2, 3} and examine the action of Aut(G) on those weights.

For the course of this section we also allow q < 5 since in certain cases we need to
consider weights of the subgroup G2(p) of G2(q), which makes it necessary to include the
groups G2(2) and G2(3) in our investigations. This shall not cause any problems here
since neither our proofs nor any of the results we refer to rely on the condition that q > 5.

The Case ℓ = 2. Let ℓ = 2 ∤ q and ε ∈ {±1} be such that q ≡ ε mod 4. Since any Sylow
2-subgroup of G is contained in the centralizer of an involution, so is any 2-subgroup of G.
Let us hence ﬁx the involution y := ha(−1)hb(−1) ∈ G for the following investigations.
By application of Lemma 4.5 and the fact that

hγ(z) = h(zhγ, ξ1i, zhγ, ξ2i, zhγ, ξ3i)

for γ ∈ Σ and z ∈ F× we obtain that y = h(1, −1, −1) ∈ T+. Moreover, by [30, Thm. 2.5]
all involutions in G are G-conjugate to y.

Lemma 4.12. The centralizer in G of the involution y = ha(−1)hb(−1) is given by

CG(y) = hT+, xa+b(t), x3a+b(t), na+b(1), n3a+b(1) | t ∈ Fqi.

Proof. Since y ∈ T+ ⊆ T, there exists an F-character χ such that y = h(χ). By [11,
Thm. 4.1] (for p > 5) and [13, Prop. 3.1 and Sec. 7] (for p = 3) we have

CG(h(χ)) = hT+, x±r(t) | r ∈ Σ, χ(r) = 1, t ∈ Fqi.

As y = h(1, −1, −1), it follows that y corresponds to the F-character χ : ZΣ −→ F× with
χ(a + b) = 1 and χ(a) = −1, and since

for c1, c2 ∈ Z, we have χ(r) = 1 for r ∈ Σ if and only if r ∈ {±(a + b), ±(3a + b)}.

(cid:3)

χ(c1a + c2b) = χ(a)c1χ(b)c2 = (−1)c1+c2

Then R ∼= 21+4

central product of two dihedral groups of order 8: from the relations in Theorem 3.1 we
conclude that

by exploiting the fact that 21+4

R =(cid:0)hxa+b(−1)x−(a+b)(−1)i ⋊ hna+b(1)i(cid:1) ◦(cid:0)hx3a+b(−1)x−(3a+b)(−1)i ⋊ hn3a+b(1)i(cid:1)

is isomorphic to D8 ◦ D8 as claimed.

We have y = h3a+b(−1) = n3a+b(1)2 ∈ R, and one easily veriﬁes that Z(R) = hyi. Hence,
R ⊆ CG(y) ∼= SO+
4 (3)), and from Lemma 4.15 it thus
follows that R is 2-radical in both SO+
4 (3). The center of R is a characteristic
subgroup of R, so we obtain that NG(R) ⊆ NG(Z(R)) = CG(y). Consequently, R is
2-radical in G2(q), and analogously it also follows that R is 2-radical in G2(3).

4 (q),

NG(R)/R ∼= (C3 × C3) ⋊ C2,

with the action of the non-trivial element of C2 on C3 × C3 given by inversion. E.g. by

CG2(3)(y) = hha(−1), hb(−1), xa+b(1), x3a+b(1), na+b(1), n3a+b(1)i > R

is contained in NG(R). Now ha(−1) and hb(−1) agree modulo R since y = ha(−1)hb(−1)
lies in R, so by the Chevalley commutator formula, Theorem 3.1(iv) and Lemma 4.5
CG2(3)(y)/R = hha(−1), xa+b(1), x3a+b(1)i = (hxa+b(1)i × hx3a+b(1)i) ⋊ hha(−1)i

with the action of ha(−1) given by inversion and

the natural epimorphism. Since 3 | q, it follows that xa+b(1)3 = x3a+b(1)3 = 1, and hence
that NG(R) = CG2(3)(y).

NG(R)/R = (hxa+b(1)i × hx3a+b(1)i) ⋊ hha(−1)i.

Let us parametrize the elements of NG(R)/R by setting

((s, t), z) := xa+b(s) x3a+b(t) z ∈ NG(R)/R

Proof. This is obvious by Lemma 4.7.

Let us now determine the conjugacy classes of the quotient NG(R)/R, where R is as in
Proposition 4.16. Information on these will allow us to understand the action of Γ on the
irreducible characters of NG(R)/R in the case that 3 | q.
Lemma 4.19. Assume that 3 | q with q ≡ 3 mod 8, let R ∼= 21+4

Cs,t := {((s, t), 1), ((−s, −t), 1)}, s, t ∈ F3, and
C⋆ := {((u, v), z) | u, v ∈ F3, z 6= 1},

where Cs,t = Cs′,t′ if and only if (s, t) = (s′, t′) or (s, t) = (−s′, −t′). In particular, the
quotient NG(R)/R has the 6 conjugacy classes C0,0, C0,1, C1,0, C1,1, C1,−1 and C⋆.

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

15

We now study subgroups of G isomorphic to the central product 21+2

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 of an

extraspecial group of order 8 and plus type with a dihedral group of order (q2 − 1)2.
Lemma 4.22. Suppose that q ≡ 1 mod 8. Then any two subgroups of SO+
phic to 21+2
isomorphic to 21+2

4 (q). Moreover, any subgroup R 6 SO+

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 are conjugate in CO+

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 is 2-radical in SO+

4 (q) isomor-
4 (q)

4 (q) with NSO+

4 (q)(R)/R ∼= S3.

Proof. For the ﬁrst statement we note that both groups 21+2
and D(q2−1)2 may be em-
bedded into GO+
2 (q) (e.g. by [3, (1G)(b)] and the fact that D(q2−1)2 is isomorphic to
a Sylow 2-subgroup of GO+
2 (q) by [20, Prop. 2.9.1(iii)]). One easily veriﬁes that any
faithful absolutely irreducible Fq-representation of 21+2
+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 is 4-dimensional, and
that, moreover, up to GL4(q)-conjugation the images in GL4(q) of all faithful irreducible
4-dimensional Fq-representations of 21+2
+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 agree. Thus, any two subgroups of
SO+
+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 must be conjugate in GL4(q), whence from
[20, Cor. 2.10.4(iii)] it follows that they must even be conjugate in CO+

4 (q) that are isomorphic to 21+2

4 (q) as claimed.

Now, if R1, R2 6 SO+

NSO+

4 (q)(R1)/R1

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2, then
∼= NSO+
4 (q)(R2)/R2

by the ﬁrst part, so it suﬃces to know that there exists at least one radical 2-subgroup of
SO+
+ ◦ D(q2−1)2. This, as well as the statement on the normalizer of
R in SO+
(cid:3)

4 (q) isomorphic to 21+2

4 (q), holds by [4, (2B)].

Lemma 4.23. Suppose that q ≡ 1 mod 8. The groups

Ra+b := hna+b(1), n3a+b(1), hb(−1), ha+b(t) | t ∈ F×
R3a+b := hna+b(1), n3a+b(1), ha(−1), h3a+b(t) | t ∈ F×

q , t(q−1)2 = 1i 6 G,
q , t(q−1)2 = 1i 6 G

are isomorphic to 21+2
conjugate in G.

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2 and 2-radical in G. Moreover, Ra+b and R3a+b are not

Proof. We have y = ha(−1)hb(−1) = ha+b(−1) ∈ Ra+b, so in particular also ha(−1) ∈
Ra+b. Using the relations given in Theorem 3.1 one can show that ha(−1)na+b(1) has
order 2 and acts on hha+b(t) | t ∈ F×
q , t(q−1)2 = 1i by inversion. Moreover, ha(−1)n3a+b(1)
has order 2 and acts on hha(−1)ha+b(i)i by inversion, where i ∈ F×
q denotes an element
of order 4 (which exists by assumption). Now the subgroups

hha+b(t) | t ∈ F×

q , t(q−1)2 = 1i ⋊ hha(−1)na+b(1)i ∼= D(q2−1)2

and

hha(−1)ha+b(i)i ⋊ hha(−1)n3a+b(1)i ∼= D8

∼= 21+2

+

of Ra+b commute with each other (following Lemma 4.2), both have center hha+b(−1)i,
and together they generate Ra+b. We conclude that Ra+b
+ ◦ D(q2−1)2. Analogously,
one can also show that R3a+b

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2.

∼= 21+2

∼= 21+2

Since y = ha(−1)hb(−1) = ha+b(−1) = h3a+b(−1) as observed before, it is contained in

both groups, and in fact both groups have center generated by y. Hence,

Ra+b, R3a+b ⊆ CG(y) ∼= SO+

4 (q),

16

and from Lemma 4.22 we deduce that Ra+b and R3a+b are 2-radical in CG(y). Moreover,
since Z(Ra+b) = Z(R3a+b) = hyi, also

NG(Ra+b), NG(R3a+b) ⊆ CG(y) ∼= SO+

4 (q).

Hence, Ra+b and R3a+b are 2-radical in G with NG(Ra+b)/Ra+b and NG(R3a+b)/R3a+b
isomorphic to S3 following Lemma 4.22.

Now suppose there is g ∈ G such that R3a+b = Rg

a+b. We then have [R3a+b, R3a+b] =

[Ra+b, Ra+b]g as well. Easy calculations under consideration of Theorem 3.1 yield

[Ra+b, Ra+b] = h ha+b(t2) | t ∈ F×
[R3a+b, R3a+b] = hh3a+b(t2) | t ∈ F×

q , t(q−1)2 = 1i,
q , t(q−1)2 = 1i.

Now let t ∈ F×
q be of order (q − 1)2. Then there must exist another element z ∈ F×
q
of order (q − 1)2 such that h3a+b(t2) = ha+b(z2)g. It is well-known that all elements of
T+ = TF which are conjugate in G must be conjugate by an element of the Weyl group
W (see, for instance, [9, Prop. 3.7.1]), which equals

W = hT, nr(1) | r ∈ Σi/ T .

Moreover, by Theorem 3.1(vii) we have

nr(1)hs(z2)nr(1)−1 = hωr(s)(z2)

for all r, s ∈ Σ, and ωr(s) is a short root if and only if s is short, so there must exist a
short root s such that h3a+b(t2) = hs(z2). From [14, Thm. 1.9.5(d)] it follows that

t2h3a+b, ri = z2hs, ri

for all r ∈ Σ (note that the deﬁnition of h_ , _i in [14] diﬀers from the one used here in
the way that the roles of the two arguments are interchanged). For r = a + b we have

h3a + b, ri = 2

(3a + b, a + b)
(3a + b, 3a + b)

= 0

since a + b and 3a + b are orthogonal roots. Hence, z2hs, a+bi = 1. Being a short root, s is
contained in {±a, ±(a + b), ±(2a + b)}, so hs, a + bi ∈ {±1, ±2} by Lemma 4.5. Thus,
z4 = 1, which contradicts the assumption that z has order (q − 1)2 and q ≡ 1 mod 8. (cid:3)

Proposition 4.24. Let q ≡ 1 mod 8. The groups Ra+b and R3a+b from Lemma 4.23 are
stabilized by Fp. If 3 | q, then Γ interchanges Ra+b and R3a+b.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement is obvious. The second claim follows from Lemma 4.7 and the
fact that ρ : Σ −→ Σ interchanges a + b and 3a + b, as well as a and b.
(cid:3)

We now study the action of Aut(G) on the 2-weights of G.

The Principal Block B0. The 2-weights of G belonging to the principal 2-block B0 have
been described by An in [4] as follows:

Proposition 4.25. Suppose that B = B0 is the principal 2-block of G. Then |W(B)| = 7.
Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G, then up to G-conjugation one of the following holds:
(i) R ∼= (C2)3, NG(R)/R ∼= GL3(2), and ϕ is the inﬂation of the Steinberg character of

GL3(2). There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such B-weights in G.

(ii) R ∼G hO2(Tε), v2i, NG(R)/R ∼= S3, and ϕ is the inﬂation of the unique irreducible
character of S3 of degree 2. There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such
B-weights in G.

(iii) R ∈ Syl2(G) is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, NG(R) = R, and ϕ is the trivial character

of NG(R). There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such B-weights in G.

(iv) q ≡ ±1 mod 8, R ∼= 21+2

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2, NG(R)/R ∼= S3, and ϕ is the inﬂation of the
unique irreducible character of S3 of degree 2. There exist exactly two G-conjugacy
classes of such B-weights in G.

(v) q ≡ ±1 mod 8, R ∼= 21+4

+ , NG(R)/R ∼= S3 × S3, and ϕ is the inﬂation of the unique
irreducible character of S3 × S3 of degree 4. There exist exactly two G-conjugacy
classes of such B-weights in G.

(vi) q ≡ ±3 mod 8, R ∼= 21+4

+ , NG(R)/R ∼= (C3 × C3)⋊ C2 with the non-trivial element of
C2 acting on C3×C3 by inversion, and ϕ is the inﬂation of one of the four irreducible
characters of NG(R)/R of degree 2. There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of
such R in G.

Proof. This follows from [4, (3C)] and the proof of [4, (3H)].

(cid:3)

The action of Aut(G) on the B0-weights of G is given as follows:

Proposition 4.26. Let B = B0 be the principal 2-block of G and suppose that (R, ϕ) is
a B-weight of G. The following statements hold:

(i) If R is as in (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) of Proposition 4.25, then up to G-conjugation (R, ϕ)

is invariant under Aut(G).

(ii) If q ≡ ±1 mod 8 and R ∼= 21+2

+ ◦ D(q2−1)2, then Fp stabilizes the G-conjugacy class of
(R, ϕ), while Γ (if existent, i.e., if 3 | q) interchanges the two G-conjugacy classes
of type (R, ϕ).

(iii) If q ≡ ±3 mod 8 and R ∼= 21+4

+ , then Fp stabilizes the G-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ).
If 3 | q, then two of the weight characters corresponding to R are stabilized by Γ, the
remaining two are interchanged.

Proof. (i) This is clear in cases (i), (ii) or (iii) of Proposition 4.25 since the character ϕ is
uniquely determined by R and there exists a unique G-conjugacy class of B-weights with
ﬁrst component isomorphic to R. If R is as in (v) of Proposition 4.25, then there exist
exactly two G-conjugacy classes of B-weights of type (R, ϕ) with ϕ uniquely determined
by R, and at least one of these has a representative with ﬁrst component lying in G2(p),
so both classes are stabilized by Fp. If p = 3, then the automorphism Γ also acts on G2(3),
which contains exactly one conjugacy class of such R by Proposition 4.25(vi). Hence, Γ
stabilizes both G-conjugacy classes of R that exist in G = G2(q), so in particular, the
G-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ) is stabilized.

18

For (ii) we observe that in consequence of Lemma 4.23 we may assume that up to
G-conjugation R is one of Ra+b or R3a+b. Since Ra+b and R3a+b are not G-conjugate by
Lemma 4.23, it follows from Proposition 4.24 that the claim holds if q ≡ 1 mod 8. Now
suppose that q ≡ −1 mod 8. Then we have q = pf for odd f and p 6= 3. Hence, the
automorphism Γ does not exist, and Fp has odd order f on G. Consequently, Fp must
stabilize both G-conjugacy classes of type (R, ϕ).

For (iii) we observe that by Proposition 4.25(vi) there exists a unique G-conjugacy
class of B-weights of type (R, ϕ) in G, and this has a representative with ﬁrst component
contained in G2(p), so assume that R 6 G2(p). Moreover, q ≡ ±3 mod 8 implies that
also p ≡ ±3 mod 8, so by the same proposition NG(R) = NG2(p)(R). We deduce that Fp
stabilizes all characters of NG(R)/R, so in particular (R, ϕ) is stabilized. For p = 3 we
may assume that R is as in Proposition 4.16, whence the action of Γ on the irreducible
characters of NG(R)/R of degree two is described in Proposition 4.21.
(cid:3)

The Blocks of Types B3, B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b, BX1 and BX2. For a 2-block B of G we write
B ∈ {B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b} if B is of one of the types B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b, and B ∈ {BX1, BX2}
if B is of type BX1 or BX2.

Proposition 4.27. The following statements hold for a 2-block B of G:

(i) If B = B3, then |W(B)| = 3. Moreover, if (R1, ϕ1) and (R2, ϕ2) are B-weights of G

that are not G-conjugate, then R1 and R2 are not isomorphic.

(ii) If B ∈ {B1a, B1b, B2a, B2b}, then |W(B)| = 2. Moreover, if (R1, ϕ1) and (R2, ϕ2)

are B-weights of G that are not G-conjugate, then R1 and R2 are not isomorphic.

(iii) If B ∈ {BX1, BX2}, then |W(B)| = 1.
In particular, in any of these cases Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. These statements follow from the proof of [4, (3I)].
The Case ℓ = 3. Let ℓ = 3 so that 3 ∤ q. Moreover, deﬁne ε ∈ {±1} to be such that
q ≡ ε mod 3 and recall that we also allow q < 5 here. For convenience we will mainly
work with the group Gε = GFε throughout this section since it provides a particularly
nice description for the maximal torus Tε = TFε, see Table 1. By [4, (1E)] we have

(cid:3)

Since we also have NGε(T)/ TFε ∼= WFε ∼= D12 with NGε(T) ⊆ NGε(Tε), it follows that

NGε(Tε) = NGε(T) = hTε, nr(1) | r ∈ Σi

NGε(Tε)/Tε

∼= D12.

in this case (cf. Lemma 4.4).

Let us now consider the group

L := hxb(t), x−b(t), x3a+b(t), x−(3a+b)(t) | t ∈ Fi 6 G = G2(F).

The Steinberg relations show that L ∼= SL3(F). Moreover, L is stable under both F+ and
F−, and we set

L+ := LF+ ∼= SL3(q),
L− := LF− ∼= SU3(q) =: SL3(−q),

where SU3(q) denotes the special unitary group of degree 3 over Fq2. In addition, we set
Kε := hLε, v2i 6 Gε. This yields the semidirect product Kε = Lε ⋊ hv2i with v2 acting on

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

19

Lε as the transpose-inverse automorphism does on SL3(εq) (cf. Lemma 4.4). Clearly, the
ﬁeld automorphism Fp of Gε acts on both Lε and Kε, and Fp(v2) = v2.

Part of the subsequent result is due to Hiß–Shamash [15], who determined the 3-blocks

and corresponding Brauer characters of G2(q) for q not divisible by 3:

Proposition 4.28. Let B be a 3-block of Gε. Then

(i) B has maximal defect if and only if B is the principal 3-block of Gε,
(ii) B has abelian defect groups if and only if B is non-principal, and
(iii) if B has non-cyclic abelian defect groups, then O3(Tε) is a defect group of B. In this

case we have

CGε(O3(Tε)) = Tε

and

NGε(O3(Tε)) = NGε(Tε),

with NGε(Tε)/Tε

∼= D12.

Proof. Parts (i), (ii) and the ﬁrst statement in (iii) are given by [15, Sec. 2.2, 2.3]. For
the normalizer and centralizer in (iii) see, for instance, [4, (1D)].
(cid:3)

Hence, if B is a non-principal 3-block of Gε that has non-cyclic defect groups, then up
to Gε-conjugation all B-weights of Gε derive from the radical 3-subgroup R = O3(Tε) of
Gε. According to Construction 2.3 the irreducible characters of R CGε(R) = Tε play a
major role in this case. We ﬁx the following parametrization for Irr(Tε):
Notation 4.29. Let z ∈ F× be of order q − ε and denote by θ0 the irreducible character
of hzi given by θ0(z) = exp(2πi/(q − ε)). Then the irreducible characters of Tε may be
parametrized as

where (θi

Irr(Tε) = {θi

0(z2).

0 | 0 6 i, j < q − ε},

Let us now examine how the normalizer of Tε in Gε acts on Irr(Tε). At the beginning
of the present section we observed that NGε(Tε) = hTε, nr(1) | r ∈ Σi, whence it suﬃces
to understand the action of nr(1), r ∈ Σ, on Irr(Tε).

given by the elements nr(1)Tε, r ∈ Σ a positive root, and v2Tε.

The Principal Block B0. The statement below provides information on the local properties
of extraspecial 3-subgroups 31+2
+ of Gε of order 31+2 and exponent 3. Along with the Sylow
3-subgroups of Gε these groups give rise to the 3-weights for the principal 3-block B0.
Proposition 4.32. For R 6 Gε with R ∼= 31+2

+ the following statements hold:

(i) Up to Gε-conjugation we have R 6 Lε and NGε(R) 6 Kε.
(ii) If R is contained in Lε, then we have

NLε(R)/R ∼=(Q8

Sp2(3)

if (q2 − 1)3 = 3,
if (q2 − 1)3 > 3.

Moreover, Lε contains exactly one Lε-conjugacy class of subgroups isomorphic to R
if (q2 − 1)3 = 3, and three such Lε-conjugacy classes if (q2 − 1)3 > 3.

(iii) (1) If (q2 − 1)3 = 3, then R ∈ Syl3(Gε), so Gε contains exactly one Gε-conjugacy
class of subgroups isomorphic to R, and we have NGε(R) = hNLε(R), ρi for some
ρ ∈ Kε \ Lε.

(2) If (q2 − 1)3 > 3, then Gε contains two Gε-conjugacy classes of subgroups iso-
morphic to R. One of these has NGε(R) = NLε(R), the other one satisﬁes
NGε(R) = hNLε(R), ρi for some ρ ∈ Kε \ Lε.

Proof. This is proven in [4, (1E)] and [4, (1G)].

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.33. For B = B0 the principal 3-block of Gε we have |W(B)| = 7. More-
over, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of Gε, then up to Gε-conjugation one of the following holds:
+ , and ϕ is the inﬂation of one of the seven

(i) (q2 − 1)3 = 3, R ∈ Syl3(Gε) with R ∼= 31+2

irreducible characters of NGε(R)/R.

(ii) (q2 − 1)3 > 3, R ∈ Syl3(Gε) is a Sylow 3-subgroup of Gε, NGε(R)/R ∼= C2 × C2, and

ϕ is the inﬂation of one of the four linear characters of C2 × C2.

(iii) (q2 − 1)3 > 3, R 6 Lε with R ∼= 31+2

+

such that it holds NGε(R) = NKε(R),
| NKε(R) : NLε(R)| = 2, and ϕ is the inﬂation of one of the two extensions of the
Steinberg character of NLε(R)/R ∼= Sp2(3) to NGε(R)/R. There exists exactly one
Gε-conjugacy class of such R in Gε.
(iv) (q2 − 1)3 > 3, R 6 Lε with R ∼= 31+2

+ where it holds that NGε(R) = NLε(R), and ϕ is
the inﬂation of the Steinberg character of NGε(R)/R ∼= Sp2(3). There exists exactly
one Gε-conjugacy class of such R in Gε.

Proof. This follows from the proof of [4, (3A)] and Proposition 4.32.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.34. Suppose that B = B0 is the principal 3-block of Gε. Then the action
of Aut(Gε)B = Aut(Gε) on W(B) is trivial.
Proof. Since 3 ∤ q, according to Proposition 4.8 it suﬃces to prove that Fp stabilizes any
conjugacy class of B-weights in Gε. We go through the cases listed in Proposition 4.33.
Let (R, ϕ) be as in Proposition 4.33(i). Then R is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G2(q), and
by Proposition 4.32 we have | NG2(q)(R)/R | = 2|Q8| = 16. Now consider the group
G2(p). Since p 6= 3, this has |G2(p)|3 = |R|, and by changing to a G2(q)-conjugate
we may thus assume that R 6 G2(p). Again by Proposition 4.32 it follows that also
| NG2(p)(R)/R | = 2|Q8| = 16, whence

NG2(q)(R) = NG2(p)(R).

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

21

In particular, Fp acts trivially on R and NG2(q)(R), and thus leaves (R, ϕ) invariant.

Now suppose the situation of Proposition 4.33(ii), i.e., (q2 − 1)3 > 3 and R ∈ Syl3(Gε).

Following the proof of [4, (1E)] we may assume that

such that NGε(R)Tε = NGε(Tε), NGε(R) ∩ Tε = O3(Tε) and NGε(R)/R ∼= C2 × C2. More-
over, we have hTε, v2, v3, nb(1)i/Tε

∼= D12, so

R = hO3(Tε), v3i

Hence, we have

NGε(Tε) = hTε, v2, v3, nb(1)i.

NGε(R) = hO3(Tε), v3, sv2, tnb(1)i

for suitable s, t ∈ Tε and NGε(R)/R = hsv2i × htnb(1)i, where
denotes the natural epimorphism. We claim that Fp acts trivially on NGε(R)/R.

: NGε(R) ։ NGε(R)/R

Suppose that Fp(sv2) = tnb(1). Since v2 and nb(1) do not coincide modulo Tε and v3
3 for some x ∈ O3(Tε)
3 coincide. Now following

has order 3 by Lemma 4.3, we must have Fp(sv2) = spv2 = tnb(1)xvi
and i ∈ {1, 2}. Hence, modulo Tε the elements v2 and nb(1)vi
Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 we have

h(z1, z2, z3)v2 = h(z−1

1 , z−1

2 , z−1
3 )

but

h(z1, z2, z3)nb(1)v3 = h(z3, z2, z1),
h(z1, z2, z3)nb(1)v2

3 = h(z1, z3, z2)

for any z1, z2, z3 ∈ F× with z1z2z3 = 1. In particular, since 3 | (q − ε), we may always ﬁnd
z1, z2, z3 ∈ F× such that h(z1, z2, z3) ∈ Tε and

h(z1, z2, z3)v2 6∈ {h(z1, z2, z3)nb(1)v3 , h(z1, z2, z3)nb(1)v2

3 },

so Fp(sv2) = tnb(1) is impossible. Similar arguments show that Fp, which stabilizes R,
acts trivially on NGε(R)/R, and thus on any B-weight (R, ϕ).

Let now (q2 − 1)3 > 3 and R ∼= 31+2

+ as in (iii) or (iv) of Proposition 4.33. By Proposi-
tion 4.32 we may assume that R 6 Lε and NGε(R) 6 Kε, with NLε(R)/R ∼= Sp2(3). Let
ω ∈ F× be of order 3 and consider

R′ :=Dh ω 0

which is extraspecial of order 31+2 and exponent 3 (cf. the proof of [4, (1G)]). Recall that
by Proposition 4.32 there exist exactly three Lε-conjugacy classes of subgroups isomorphic
∼= SL3(εq), two of which are conjugate under Gε, and the other one having a
to R in Lε
representative that is stabilized by v2 respectively by the transpose-inverse automorphism
(cf. also the proof of [4, (1G)]). This automorphism ﬁxes R′, so if R is as in (iii), then
we may suppose that R corresponds to the group R′ in SL3(εq) ∼= Lε and NGε(R) =
hNLε(R), v2i. In particular, R is stabilized by Fp. Let St± ∈ Irr(NGε(R)/R) denote the
two extensions of the Steinberg character St of

NLε(R)/R ∼= Sp2(3)

22

to hNLε(R), v2i/R. Then we have St−(v2) = − St+(v2). By Lemma 4.3 it holds that v2
2 = 1.
Moreover, St+(1) = 3. Hence, the character value St+(v2) is congruent to 3 modulo 2. In
particular, we have St+(v2), St−(v2) 6= 0. Now, since Fp ﬁxes v2, we have

(St+)Fp(v2) = St+(v2) 6= 0

and

(St−)Fp(v2) = St−(v2) 6= 0.

Moreover, being the unique irreducible character of NGε(R)/R of degree 3, St is left
invariant by Fp, so

((St±)Fp)| NLε (R)/R = StFp = St,

and we conclude by application of [34, Rmk. 9.3(i)] that Fp leaves both St+ and St−
invariant. Hence, it follows that Fp ﬁxes the Gε-conjugacy class of any B-weight (R, ϕ)
as ϕ is the inﬂation of one of St+ or St−.

Finally, suppose that (R, ϕ) is as in (iv). Then up to Gε-conjugation R is uniquely
determined in Gε by its normalizer NGε(R), and ϕ is uniquely determined by R, so the
Gε-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ) is stabilized by Aut(Gε). This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

The Block B2. Recall that this 3-block only exists if q is odd.

Proposition 4.35. Let B = B2. Then |W(B)| = 4. Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight
of Gε, then up to Gε-conjugation R = O3(Tε) with NGε(R) = NGε(Tε) and CGε(R) = Tε,
and if a linear character θ ∈ Irr(Tε) is a constituent of ϕ|Tε, then θ2 = 1Tε 6= θ and

NGε(R)θ/Tε

∼= C2 × C2.

The set Irr(NGε(R)θ | θ) consists of four distinct extensions of θ, and ϕ = ψNGε (Tε) for
some ψ ∈ Irr(NGε(R)θ | θ). Furthermore, Aut(Gε)B = Aut(Gε) acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. All but the last assertion follow from Proposition 4.28 and the proof of [4, (3B)].
As before, for the last claim it suﬃces to check invariance under the action of Fp. We
let (R, ϕ) be a B-weight of Gε and assume that R = O3(Tε) with R CGε(R) = Tε and
NGε(R) = NGε(Tε). Let θ be an irreducible constituent of ϕ|Tε. Then this has order 2, so
in the parametrization of Notation 4.29 it follows that θ is one of

The latter two characters are conjugate to the ﬁrst via na(1) and na+b(1), respectively
(cf. Lemma 4.30), so since by Cliﬀord theory all irreducible constituents of ϕ|Tε are
NGε(Tε)-conjugate, we may assume that

which is left invariant by nb(1), n2a+b(1) and v2 = nb(1)n2a+b(1)−1 following Lemma 4.30.
∼= C2 × C2, so in fact NGε(R)θ = hTε, nb(1), v2i. Since Fp acts
Now we have NGε(R)θ/Tε
trivially on both nb(1) and v2, it follows that Fp stabilizes NGε(R)θ and we have

(ψFp)NGε (R) = (ψNGε (R))Fp

for all ψ ∈ NGε(R)θ. Thus, we only need to check that any extension of θ to NGε(R)θ
stays invariant under Fp. But this follows from [34, Rmk. 9.3(i)] since θ is linear,

(ψFp)|Tε = θFp = θp = θ = ψ|Tε,

ψFp(nb(1)) = ψ(nb(1)) 6= 0 and ψFp(v2) = ψ(v2) 6= 0 for any ψ ∈ NGε(R)θ.

Remark 4.36. By Proposition 4.35 for the 3-block B = B2, a B-weight (O3(Tε), ϕ) and an
irreducible constituent θ ∈ Irr(Tε) of ϕ|Tε we have θ2 = 1Tε, θ 6= 1Tε, and θ extends to its
stabilizer NGε(Tε)θ in NGε(Tε). This is stated in [4, (3B)] but the proof of the extendibility
of θ given there is not very precise. For later use it will be convenient to reprove it here
in more detail. As in the proof of Proposition 4.35 we may assume that

and NGε(Tε)θ = hTε, nb(1), v2i. By deﬁnition we have v2 = nb(1)n−(2a+b)(1). From The-
orem 3.1(vi) and Table 2 it follows that nb(1) and v2 commute. Since hTε, nb(1)i/Tε is
cyclic, there exists an extension η of θ to hTε, nb(1)i (e.g. [17, Problem 6.17]), and as
[nb(1), v2] = 1, nb(1)2 ∈ Tε and v2 normalizes hTε, nb(1)i and stabilizes θ, it follows that
v2 leaves η invariant. Hence, η has an extension η′ to NGε(Tε)θ = hTε, nb(1), v2i since
hTε, nb(1), v2i/hTε, nb(1)i ∼= C2 is cyclic. Then η′ extends θ to NGε(Tε)θ as claimed.

Ba :=(B1a

B2a

if ε = +1,
if ε = −1,

Bb :=(B1b

B2b

if ε = +1,
if ε = −1,

so if a 3-block B is of type Ba or Bb, then it possesses non-cyclic defect groups. We write
B ∈ {Ba, Bb} in this case.

Proposition 4.37. Suppose that B ∈ {Ba, Bb} is a 3-block of Gε. Then |W(B)| = 2.
Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of Gε, then up to Gε-conjugation it holds that R =
O3(Tε) with NGε(R) = NGε(Tε) and CGε(R) = Tε, and for any constituent θ ∈ Irr(Tε) of
ϕ|Tε we have

NGε(R)θ/Tε

∼= C2

and ϕ = ψNGε (R) for one of the two extensions ψ ∈ Irr(NGε(Tε)θ | θ) of θ. Furthermore,
Aut(Gε)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. All but the last assertion follow from Proposition 4.28 and the proof of [4, (3B)].
To prove the last claim, let (R, ϕ) be a B-weight of Gε and assume that R = O3(Tε) with
∼= C2 if θ ∈ Irr(Tε) is a constituent of ϕ|Tε. Since by
NGε(R) = NGε(Tε), and NGε(R)θ/Tε
Cliﬀord theory all irreducible constituents of ϕ|Tε are NGε(Tε)-conjugate, in consequence
of Corollary 4.31 we may assume that

0 × θ−i
0
for a suitable 0 < i < q − ε, whence by Lemma 4.30 we have

0 × θi
0

θ = θi

θ = θi

or

NGε(R)θ =(hTε, nb(1)i

hTε, n2a+b(1)i

if θ = θi
if θ = θi

0 × θi
0,
0 × θ−i
0 .

For this one should note that v2 6∈ NGε(R)θ as otherwise θ would be as in the proof of
Proposition 4.35 with NGε(R)θ

∼= C2 × C2. In particular, i 6= (q − ε)/2.

Let us now suppose that a ∈ Aut(Gε)B. Since any inner automorphism of Gε stabilizes

B, we may assume that a = F k

p for some k ∈ N (cf. Proposition 4.8), so that
(R, ϕ)a = (R, ϕ)F k

p = (R, ϕF k
p )

24

and we need to prove that ϕ is left invariant by F k
p . Due to the fact that Fp, and hence
also a = F k
p , acts on Tε, we have that θa is an irreducible character of Tε. Since (R, ϕ)
is a B-weight, it follows from Construction 2.3 that bl(θ)Gε = B, and from the fact that
a stabilizes B we may deduce that bl(θa)Gε = B. But B has defect group O3(Tε) by
Proposition 4.28, just like any 3-block of Tε in consequence of [27, Thm. 4.8], so the
extended ﬁrst main theorem of Brauer [27, Thm. 9.7] implies that θa and θ, the canonical
characters of bl(θa) and bl(θ), respectively, are conjugate under NGε(Tε). Now Lemma 4.30
yields the following NGε(Tε)-conjugates of θ in the case θ = θi
0 × θi
0:
θ−i
1 × θ−i
0 ,
0 × 1.

0 × θ−i
θ−i
0 ,

0 × θi
θi
0,

θi
0 × 1,

1 × θi
0,

These are pairwise distinct as i 6= (q − ε)/2, so since | NGε(Tε) : NGε(Tε)θ| = 6, these
must indeed be all NGε(Tε)-conjugates of θ in this case. Similarly, for θ = θi
the
NGε(Tε)-conjugates of θ are given by
0 × θi
θ−i
0,

0 × θ−i
θ−2i
0 ,

0 × θ−2i
θ−i

0 × θ−i
θi
0 ,

0 × θ2i
θi
0 ,

0 × θi
θ2i
0,

0 × θ−i
0

.

0

Note that these characters are pairwise distinct as i 6= (q − ε)/2 and 2i 6≡ −i mod (q − ε),
where the latter holds since otherwise θ would be of order 3, which is not possible since
O3(Tε) ⊆ ker(θ). Now a = F k
p acts on Irr(Tε) by raising the linear characters of Tε to
their pk-th power, that is,

θa =(θipk

0 × θipk
θipk
0 × θ−ipk

0

0

if θ = θi
if θ = θi

0 × θi
0,
0 × θ−i
0 .

Hence, since θa and θ are NGε(Tε)-conjugate, the above observations on the shapes of
the NGε(Tε)-conjugates of θ imply that θa ∈ {θ, θ−1}. According to Lemma 4.30 we have
θ−1 = θv2. Let us introduce the notation cx(g) = xgx−1 for all x, g ∈ Gε and set

a′ :=(a = F k

acv2 = F k

p

p cv2

if θa = θ,
if θa = θ−1.

Then θa′ = θ, and ϕ is left invariant by a = F k
p if and only if it is stabilized by a′ since
v2 ∈ NGε(Tε) = NGε(R). Moreover, in consequence of Theorem 3.1(vi) and Table 2 we
have [n2a+b(1), nb(1)] = 1, whence it follows that a′ stabilizes both nb(1) and n2a+b(1).
Now by the ﬁrst part of the claim there exists ψ ∈ Irr(NGε(Tε)θ | θ) such that ϕ = ψNGε (Tε)
and hence

ϕa′

= (ψNGε (Tε))a′

= (ψa′

)NGε (Tε),

where ψa′ ∈ Irr(NGε(Tε)θ | θ) since a′ stabilizes Tε, nb(1), n2a+b(1) and θ. We prove that
ψa′ = ψ. It holds that (ψa′)|Tε = θ = ψ|Tε. Moreover, we have NGε(Tε)θ = hTε, ni, where
n equals nb(1) or n2a+b(1) depending on θ, and n is left invariant by a′. Hence, since ψ is
linear, we conclude that

ψa′

(n) = ψ(n) 6= 0,

implying in accordance with [34, Rmk. 9.3(i)] that ψa′ = ψ. Thus, we have ϕa = ϕa′ = ϕ
as claimed, which concludes the proof.

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

25

The Blocks of Types BX1 and BX2. Recall that a 3-block of type BX1 has non-cyclic defect
groups if and only if q ≡ 1 mod 3, while a 3-block of type BX2 is of non-cyclic defect if
and only if q ≡ −1 mod 3. By [4, (3B)] we have:

Proposition 4.38. Let B ∈ {BX1, BX2} be a 3-block of Gε with non-cyclic defect groups.
Then |W(B)| = 1. In particular, Aut(Gε)B acts trivially on W(B).

In summary, we have proven the following:

Proposition 4.39. Let ℓ ∈ {2, 3} and let B be an ℓ-block of G of non-cyclic defect. Then
the iBAW condition (cf. Deﬁnition 2.6) holds for B.

Proof. We assume ﬁrst that B is not the principal 2-block of G. By [4] we have | IBr(B)| =
|W(B)|. We may hence choose a bijection ΩB : IBr(B) −→ W(B). By Propositions 4.10
and 4.11 the action of Aut(G)B on IBr(B) is trivial, and moreover, by the results of
Section 4.2.2 also W(B) is stabilized pointwise by Aut(G)B. In particular, ΩB is trivially
Aut(G)B-equivariant, whence by Lemma 2.11 the iBAW condition holds for B.

Assume now that B is the principal 2-block of G. By [4] we have | IBr(B)| = |W(B)| =
7. If we can ﬁnd an Aut(G)B-equivariant bijection ΩB : IBr(B) −→ W(B), then by the
same arguments as above the claim follows. According to Propositions 4.10 and 4.26
the action of Aut(G)B = Aut(G) is trivial on both IBr(B) and W(B) if 3 ∤ q as in this
case Aut(G) = hG, Fpi by Proposition 4.8, so there is nothing to prove in this situation.
Assume hence that 3 | q, in which case Proposition 4.8 gives Aut(G) = hG, Γi. By
Propositions 4.10 and 4.26 it holds that Γ induces a transposition on both IBr(B) and
W(B). Thus, an Aut(G)-equivariant bijection ΩB : IBr(B) −→ W(B) exists.
(cid:3)

We may now prove our ﬁrst main result:

Proof of Theorem A. The simple group G = G2(q) is its own universal covering group if
q > 5, and by Proposition 4.8 its outer automorphism group is cyclic.

Let ℓ be a prime dividing |G|. If ℓ = p, then the claim holds by [35, Thm. C], so we
assume that ℓ 6= p. Then ℓ divides at least one of the factors Φ1(q), Φ2(q), Φ3(q) and
Φ6(q). Using [23, Lemma 5.2] one sees that if ℓ > 5, then it divides exactly one of Φ1(q),
Φ2(q), Φ3(q) or Φ6(q). Suppose that 5 6 ℓ | Φ3(q)Φ6(q). Then a Sylow ℓ-subgroup of G is
contained in a maximal torus of G of type T3 or T6 depending on whether ℓ divides Φ3(q)
or Φ6(q), so in particular the Sylow ℓ-subgroups of G are cyclic in this case (cf. Table 1),
whence the iBAW conditions holds for G and ℓ by [21, Thm. 1.1].

Assume now that 5 6 ℓ | Φ1(q)Φ2(q). Then the ℓ-blocks of G have either cyclic or
maximal defect (see [32, Prop. 3.1, 4.1] and [33, p. 1379]). For the ℓ-blocks of cyclic defect
the iBAW condition holds again by [21, Thm. 1.1], while it has been proven to hold for
3-blocks of maximal defect by Cabanes–Späth in [8, Cor. 7.6].

The case of non-cyclic ℓ-blocks of G for ℓ ∈ {2, 3} is treated in Proposition 4.39, which
(cid:3)

concludes the proof.

5. The Groups 3D4(q)

We now turn to the second series of exceptional groups of Lie type treated here, the

Steinberg triality groups 3D4(q).

26

5.1. Properties of 3D4(q). Steinberg’s triality groups are ﬁnite groups of Lie type and
may be constructed as ﬁxed point groups of universal Chevalley groups of type D4 under a
certain endomorphism deriving from an exceptional symmetry of order 3 of the associated
Dynkin diagram.

We consider a root system Σ of type D4 over the ﬁeld of real numbers, i.e.,

Σ = {±ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 4},

where e1, e2, e3, e4 form an orthonormal basis of R4. Inside Σ we ﬁx a base for this root
system given by Π = {r1, r2, r3, r4}, where r1 := e1 − e2, r2 := e2 − e3, r3 := e3 − e4 and
r4 := e3 + e4.

Let G = D4(F) be a universal Chevalley group of type D4 over F with Steinberg
generators xr(t), hr(s) and nr(s), r ∈ F, s ∈ F×, as in Theorem 3.1. We ﬁx a prime
power q = pf , f ∈ N>0. The ﬁeld automorphism F −→ F, a 7−→ aq, induces a Frobenius
endomorphism Fq of G (cf. Section 4.1). Another endomorphism of G is obtained as
follows. We consider the triality symmetry ρ of the Dynkin diagram of type D4 given by

ρ : Π −→ Π,

r1 7−→ r3 7−→ r4 7−→ r1,

ρ(r2) = r2.

There exists a unique isometry of R4 = RΣ which maps each r ∈ Π to its image ρ(r) under
ρ, cf. [10, p. 217]. We denote this isometry by ρ as well. According to [10, Prop. 12.2.2]
it holds that ρ is a linear transformation of R4 satisfying ρ(Σ) = Σ. By [10, Prop. 12.2.3
and Lemma 13.6.2] by choosing a suitable Chevalley basis for the simple Lie algebra of
type D4 underlying G we may assume that ρ induces a graph automorphism τ of G given
by

τ : G −→ G,

xr(t) 7−→ xρ(r)(t),

r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F.

This satisﬁes τ (nr(t)) = nρ(r)(t) and τ (hr(t)) = hρ(r)(t) for r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F×. Note that τ
commutes with Fq and has order 3 as an automorphism of G.

We deﬁne the endomorphism F of G as the product τ Fq = Fqτ . Then F 3 = τ 3F 3
so F is a Steinberg endomorphism of G. The group 3D4(q) is deﬁned as the group

q = F 3
q ,

G := 3D4(q) := GF = {g ∈ G | F (g) = g}.

Since F 3 = F 3
By [10, Thm. 14.3.2] its order is given by

q , it follows that G is contained in the ﬁnite group D4(q3) := D4(Fq3) = GF 3
q .

It is well-known that for any prime power q the group 3D4(q) is simple and constitutes its
own universal covering group, see, e.g., [25, Table 24.2, Thm. 24.17 and Rmk. 24.19].

(cid:12)(cid:12)3D4(q)(cid:12)(cid:12) = q12Φ1(q)2Φ2(q)2Φ3(q)2Φ6(q)2Φ12(q).

Let us reconsider the isometry ρ of R4 = RΣ deﬁned above. For a root r ∈ Σ we let
3 (r + ρ(r) + ρ2(r)) denote the orthogonal projection of r onto the subspace of RΣ

er := 1
invariant under ρ. By [25, Example 23.6] the set eΣ := {er | r ∈ Σ} forms a root system
of type G2. For S ∈ eΣ we deﬁne Σ(S) := {r ∈ Σ |er = S}. Then for each S ∈ eΣ the set

Σ(S) is the positive system of roots of a root system of type A1 or A3
1.

For S ∈ eΣ we deﬁne the group XS := hxr(t) | r ∈ Σ(S), t ∈ Fi 6 G . Moreover, for
S ∈eΣ, r ∈ Σ wither = S, and t ∈ Fq3 we set
Then by [36, Lemma 63] for S ∈eΣ we have
S =({xS(t) | t ∈ Fq}
S with S ∈eΣ.

and since G is universal, according to [36, Lemma 64] the group G = GF is generated by
the ﬁxed point groups XF

5.1.1. Weyl Group and Maximal Tori of 3D4(q). Let T be the F -stable maximal torus of G
generated by all elements hr(t), r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F×, and W = NG(T)/ T be the corresponding
Weyl group. As is well-known, W is isomorphic to hωr | r ∈ Σi via nr(1) T 7→ ωr, so we
may identify those two groups in the following. Now we denote by ω0 the longest element
of W and by r∗ the highest root of Σ. Then ω0 = −1 by [14, Rmk. 1.8.9] and one easily
veriﬁes that the root e1 + e2 ∈ Σ has height 5 with respect to the chosen base Π, which
makes it the highest root of Σ. Moreover, we use the short notation

if Σ(S) has type A1,
{xS(t) | t ∈ Fq3} if Σ(S) has type A3

h(z1, z2, z3, z4) := hr1(z1)hr2(z2)hr3(z3)hr4(z4)

for z1, z2, z3, z4 ∈ F×. There exist seven G-conjugacy classes of maximal tori in G with
representatives in G given in Table 4 below, see [12, p. 42] and [18, Table I].

Lemma 5.1. The generators ωr, r ∈ Π, of the Weyl group W of G act on the maximal
torus T as follows:

ωr1h(t1, t2, t3, t4)ω−1
ωr2h(t1, t2, t3, t4)ω−1

3 , t4),
r4 = h(t1, t2, t3, t2t−1
4 )

for all t1, t2, t3, t4 ∈ F×.

Proof. Easy calculations using Theorem 3.1.

(cid:3)

Let us now take a closer look at the Weyl groups associated to the maximal tori of

types T+ and T−, which will occur most frequently in the following.

Lemma 5.2. Let w ∈ {1, ω0}. Then ωr2 and ωr1ωr3ωr4 are ﬁxed points of W under wF .

Proof. Since w ∈ Z(W), it suﬃces to show that ωr2 and ωr1ωr3ωr4 are ﬁxed under the
action of F . The element ωr2 is identiﬁed with nr2(1) T and we have

F (nr2(1)) = nρ(r2)(1q) = nr2(1)

by deﬁnition of F , so clearly ωr2 ∈ WwF . Again by deﬁnition of F we moreover have

F (nr1(1)nr3(1)nr4(1)) = nρ(r1)(1)nρ(r3)(1)nρ(r4)(1)

= nr3(1)nr4(1)nr1(1).

Now the roots r1, r3 and r4 are pairwise perpendicular, whence the corresponding reﬂec-
tions commute, i.e., nr3(1)nr4(1)nr1(1) and nr1(1)nr3(1)nr4(1) agree modulo T. Conse-
quently, ωr1ωr3ωr4 is ﬁxed by F , and hence by wF , as claimed.
(cid:3)
Corollary 5.3. Let w ∈ {1, ω0}. Then WwF = hωr2, ωr1ωr3ωr4i.
Proof. Following Lemma 5.2 we have ωr2, ωr1ωr3ωr4 ∈ WwF . Moreover, by direct calcula-
tions the element ¯ω := ωr1ωr3ωr4ωr2 ∈ WwF has order 6, and, naturally, the order of the
reﬂection ωr2 in WwF is 2. Direct calculations show that ωr2 acts on h ¯wi by inversion.
Hence, the claim follows since by Table 4 the group WwF is dihedral of order 12.
(cid:3)

5.1.2. Automorphisms of 3D4(q). The automorphism group of the triality group G =
3D4(q) is particularly easy to describe. By [36, p. 158] the ﬁeld automorphism F −→ F,
a 7−→ ap, induces an automorphism Fp of the group G = D4(F) via
r ∈ Σ, t ∈ F.

xr(t) 7−→ xr(tp),

Fp : G −→ G,

Since Fp clearly commutes with F , it also induces an automorphism of G = GF , which
will be called the ﬁeld automorphism Fp of G. Note that its order in Aut(G) is given by
3f , where q = pf , since G 6 D4(q3) as observed before.
Proposition 5.4. For G = 3D4(q) with q = pf , f ∈ N>0, we have

In particular, the outer automorphism group of G is cyclic.

Aut(G) = G ⋊ hFpi.

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

29

Proof. This is a well-known statement, which may, for instance, be derived from [25,
Table 22.1] together with [14, Thm. 2.5.12(a),(d),(f)].
(cid:3)

5.1.3. Special Subgroups of 3D4(q). Let us now introduce certain subgroups of 3D4(q)
which will play a role in the description and examination of the weights of 3D4(q).

(XF

S )Fq = {xS(t) | t ∈ Fq},

Proof. This is well known and follows from the fact that G is generated by the groups
XF

Proposition 5.5. For G = 3D4(q) we denote by eG := Gτ (= GFq) the subgroup of ﬁxed
points of G under τ (or equivalently under Fq). Then eG ∼= G2(q).
S , S ∈eΣ, with
and the generators xS(t), S ∈ eΣ, t ∈ Fq, satisfy the same relations as for type G2 (cf.,
Corollary 5.6. Let eG ∼= G2(q) be as in Proposition 5.5. Then the ﬁeld automorphism Fp
of G acts on eG as the ﬁeld automorphism of G2(q) deﬁned in Section 4.1.3.
Proof. This is a consequence of the previous proposition as for S ∈ eΣ, t ∈ Fq, we have

Fp(xS(t)) = xS(tp), i.e., the operation of Fp on the generators xS(t) is as for type G2. (cid:3)

e.g., [14, Thm. 1.12.1, Table 2.4, Thm. 2.4.5 and Thm. 2.4.7]).

We now consider further subgroups of G, some of which we have already encountered as
subgroups of G2(q) in Section 4. We stick to the notation used in [5]. The subgroups of G
introduced now are denoted Kδ and Lδ. These groups already appeared in Section 4.2.2
as subgroups of G2(q).

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.7. We ﬁx a maximal subgroup eG ∼= G2(q) of G. Then following [5, p. 275]
for δ ∈ {±1} there exist maximal subgroups Kδ of eG such that these contain subgroups

Lδ

∼= SL3(δq) =(SL3(q)

SU3(q)

if δ = +1,
if δ = −1,

and Kδ is the extension of Lδ by an involutory outer automorphism.

Two further subgroups will play a role here. For the deﬁnition of these a classiﬁcation

of semisimple elements of G is needed, for which we refer to [12, Table 2.1].

Deﬁnition 5.8. Let δ ∈ {±1} be such that q ≡ δ mod 3 and let s ∈ G be a semisimple
element of type s4 if δ = +1 or of type s9 if δ = −1. Then as in [5, pp. 274/275] we set
Mδ := NG(hsi) and Hδ := CG(s).

∼= C2. Moreover, as done in [5] we
Remark 5.9. By [5, p. 275] it holds that Mδ/Hδ
may assume that the semisimple element s in the previous deﬁnition is chosen such that
Kδ 6 Mδ and Lδ 6 Hδ.

5.2. Action of Automorphisms. Similarly as for the groups G2(q), easy arguments
relying on irreducible character values of G and the unitriangularity of the corresponding
decomposition matrices yield the following result, see [31, Prop. 16.1, 16.2]:

Proposition 5.10. Let B be an ℓ-block of G for ℓ ∈ {2, 3} and assume that ℓ ∤ q. Then
any Brauer character in IBr(B) is left invariant by Aut(G)B.

30

The study of the action of Aut(G) on the conjugacy classes of the ℓ-weights in G,
ℓ ∈ {2, 3}, is conducted blockwise, the main distinction being made between ℓ-blocks of
abelian defect and ℓ-blocks of non-abelian defect.

The Case ℓ = 2. Throughout this section we assume that ℓ = 2 ∤ q and let ε ∈ {±1} be
such that q ≡ ε mod 4.

The 2-weights of G for the principal 2-block B0 have been described by An [5] as in
Proposition 5.11 below. Note that there are signiﬁcant parallels to the situation of the
principal 2-block of G2(q) (cf. Proposition 4.25).

Proposition 5.11. Suppose that B = B0 is the principal 2-block of G. Then |W(B)| = 7.
Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G, then up to G-conjugation one of the following holds:
(i) R ∼= (C2)3, NG(R)/R ∼= GL3(2), and ϕ is the inﬂation of the Steinberg character of

GL3(2). There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such B-weights in G.

(ii) R = hO2(Tε), ρi for some involution ρ ∈ NG(Tε), NG(R)/R ∼= S3, and ϕ is the

(vi) q ≡ ±3 mod 8, R ∼= 21+4

of degree 2. There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such R in G.

Proof. This follows from [5, (2B)–(2D), (3C)] and the proofs of [5, (3G)] and [4, (3H)]. (cid:3)

Remark 5.12. If (R, ϕ) is a B0-weight for G with R as in (iv), (v) or (vi) of Proposition 5.11,
then as in the proof of [5, (3C)] we may assume that R is contained in a maximal subgroup

N eG(R) 6 N eG(Z(R)) = C eG(Z(R)) ∼= SO+

4 (q)

4 (q) with N eG(R)/R ∼= NG(R)/R by [4, (2B)]. Thus,

and R is 2-radical in C eG(Z(R)) ∼= SO+

eG of G isomorphic to G2(q) such that
we observe that NG(R) is already contained in eG.

Proposition 5.13. Let B = B0 be the principal 2-block of G. Then Aut(G)B = Aut(G)
acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. Let (R, ϕ) be a B-weight. If R is as in Proposition 5.11(i), (ii) or (iii), then the
G-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ) is uniquely determined by the isomorphism type of R. Hence,
it stays invariant under Aut(G).

Suppose now that R is as in (iv), (v) or (vi) of Proposition 5.11. Following Remark 5.12

we may assume that NG(R) is contained in the subgroup eG ∼= G2(q), where eG is as

in Proposition 5.5. According to Proposition 5.4 we have Aut(G) = hG, Fpi with Fp

a be an element of Aut(G). Inner automorphisms of G do not play a role here, i.e., we
may assume that a = F i

stabilizing eG and acting on it as a ﬁeld automorphism of G2(q) by Corollary 5.6. Now let
p for some i ∈ N. Now R 6 NG(R) 6 eG, so we may regard (R, ϕ)
as a 2-weight for eG and a = F i
p as a power of the ﬁeld automorphism of eG. Hence, by
Proposition 4.26 the 2-weight (R, ϕ) is stabilized by a up to eG-conjugation.

For non-principal 2-blocks of G of non-abelian defect An [5, (3G)] showed the following:

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.14. Let B be a non-principal 2-block of G with non-abelian defect groups.
Then |W(B)| ∈ {2, 3}. Moreover, if (R1, ϕ1) and (R2, ϕ2) are non-conjugate B-weights,
then one has R1 6∼= R2. In particular, Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Let us now turn towards the abelian defect case.

Proposition 5.15. Suppose that B is a 2-block of G which has a non-cyclic abelian defect
group D. Then the following statements hold:

(i) The centralizer CG(D) =: T is a maximal torus of G of type Tε, D = O2(T ) and

NG(D) = NG(T ) with NG(T )/T ∼= D12.

(ii) Consider Irr(T ) as an abelian group and ﬁx an isomorphism ˆ: T −→ Irr(T ). Up to
G-conjugation there exists a unique 2′-element s ∈ T and a 2-block b of T = CG(D)
with bG = B such that θ := ˆs ∈ Irr(T ) is the canonical character of b.

(iii) For θ and s as in (ii) we have NG(T )θ/T ∼= CW (T )(s), where W (T ) := NG(T )/T .

Proof. For (i) we observe that according to [12, Prop. 5.8] the centralizer CG(D) =: T
is a maximal torus of G such that D = O2(T ). Since maximal tori of G of types T1,±
and T3 are cyclic and maximal tori of types T2,± have odd order, it follows that T must
be of type Tδ for some δ ∈ {±1}. But by [5, (2D)(a)] the centralizer of O2(Tδ) in G is
a maximal torus if and only if δ = ε, so T must be of type Tε. Moreover, by the same
reference it follows that NG(D) = NG(T ) with NG(T )/T ∼= D12.

Parts (ii) and (iii) can be found as parts (b) and (c) of Proposition 5.8 in [12].

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.16. Let B be a 2-block of G with non-cyclic abelian defect groups. Then
Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. Suppose that (R, ϕ) is a B-weight. Since B has abelian defect, it follows from
Lemma 2.4 that R is a defect group of B. Hence, due to Proposition 5.15(i) we have
R = O2(T ) for some maximal torus T of G of type Tε and NG(R) = NG(T ). Let s ∈ T ,
θ = ˆs and b ∈ Bl2(T ) be as in Proposition 5.15(ii) such that NG(T )θ/T ∼= CW (T )(s) for
W (T ) = NG(T )/T .

Since B is non-principal and s is of odd order, it follows that s2 6= 1. Hence, according
to [12, Table 3.4] up to isomorphism we have CW (T )(s) ∈ {{1}, C2, S3}. However, b has
defect group R, and since B = bG has defect group R as well, [27, Thm. 9.22] implies that
the index | NG(T )θ : T | is prime to 2. We conclude that NG(T )θ = T .

Following Construction 2.3 we hence have ϕ = θNG(T ), so ϕ is uniquely determined by
R and B. If a ∈ Aut(G)B, then as above the ﬁrst component Ra of the B-weight (R, ϕ)a
must be a defect group of B, so in particular it is G-conjugate to R.

The Case ℓ = 3. Throughout this section we assume that 3 ∤ q and denote by ε the
unique element in {±1} with q ≡ ε mod 3. If T is a maximal torus of G of type Tε, then

isomorphic to Cq−ε × Cq−ε. Then as observed in the case ℓ = 3 for G2(q) it also holds

in consequence of [5, (1A)] it holds that NG(T )/T ∼= D12. We let eG ∼= G2(q) be as in
Proposition 5.5 and assume that T is such that eT := T ∩ eG is a maximal torus of eG
that N eG(eT )/eT ∼= D12. This allows us to prove the following two statements:
Lemma 5.17. Suppose that eG ∼= G2(q) is as in Proposition 5.5 and let T be a maximal
torus of G of type Tε such that eT := T ∩eG is a maximal torus of eG with eT ∼= Cq−ε × Cq−ε.
Then it holds that CG(eT ) = T .
already lie in eT and centralize each other. Following Table 4 some of these are of the

form x = h(z, z−1, z, z) with z ∈ F× of order 3, and by [12, Tables 2.2a, 2.2b] these have
CG(x)/Z ∼= PSL2(q3) or CG(x)/Z ∼= PGL2(q3) for some central subgroup Z ∼= Cq−ε of
CG(x) with x ∈ Z, depending on whether q is even or odd. Then x, x−1 ∈ Z, and the
residue class of any other element of T of order 3 is non-trivial in CG(x)/Z. Hence, for
y ∈ T of order 3 with y 6= x, x−1 we have | CCG(x)(y)| = (q3 − ε)(q − ε) = |T |, so the claim
(cid:3)

Proof. Since T ∼= Cq3−ε × Cq−ε, there exist exactly 8 elements of order 3 in T , all of which

follows since T ⊆ CG(eT ) ⊆ CG(x) ∩ CG(y) = CCG(x)(y).
Proposition 5.18. In the situation of Lemma 5.17 we have NG(T ) = N eG(eT )T .
Proof. We prove that N eG(eT ) normalizes T . Then N eG(eT )T ⊆ NG(T ), and since NG(T )/T
and N eG(eT )/eT are isomorphic to D12 and
we obtain equality. By Lemma 5.17 we have CG(eT ) = T , so every element of G which
normalizes eT stabilizes CG(eT ) = T . In particular, N eG(eT ) ⊆ NG(T ) as claimed.

N eG(eT )T /T ∼= N eG(eT )/(N eG(eT ) ∩ T ) = N eG(eT )/eT ∼= D12,

We ﬁrst consider the 3-blocks of G with non-abelian defect. For the principal 3-block
B0 the following has been shown to hold by An, see [5, (1A)] and the proof of [5, (3B)]:

(cid:3)

(i) R is an extraspecial group 31+2

Proposition 5.19. Suppose that B = B0 is the principal 3-block of G. Then |W(B)| = 7.
Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G, then up to G-conjugation one of the following holds:
+ such that R 6 Lε 6 Hε, CG(R) = Z(Hε) ∼= Cq2+εq+1,
NG(R) = NMε(R), NHε(R)/R CG(R) ∼= Sp2(3), | NG(R) : NHε(R)| = 2, and ϕ is
the inﬂation of one of the two extensions of the Steinberg character of Sp2(3) to
NG(R)/R CG(R). There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such R in G.

(ii) R ∈ Syl3(G), CG(R) ∼= Cq2+εq+1, NG(R)/R CG(R) ∼= C2 × C2, and ϕ is the inﬂation

of one of the four irreducible characters of NG(R)/R CG(R).

(iii) R = O3(T ) for a maximal torus T of G of type T2,ε, NG(R)/R CG(R) ∼= Sp2(3) with
CG(R) = T , and ϕ is the inﬂation of the Steinberg character of NG(R)/R CG(R).
There exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such B-weights in G.

In order to understand the action of Aut(G) on the 3-weights associated to the principal

3-block of G we need the following observation given by [5, (1C)]:

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

33

Lemma 5.20. Let R 6 G be an extraspecial group 31+2
G-conjugacy class of subgroups of G isomorphic to R, and if R 6 Lε 6 Kε 6 Mε, then

+ . Then there exists exactly one

for some involution ρ ∈ Kε \ Lε such that Mε = hHε, ρi.

NG(R)/R CG(R) ∼= Sp2(3) ⋊ hρi

Lemma 5.21. Let T be a maximal torus of G of type Tε. Then there exists an automor-
phism a ∈ Aut(G)T with Out(G) = ha Inn(G)i which acts trivially on NG(T )/T .

If necessary, after replacing T by a

Proof. Let eG ∼= G2(q) be as in Proposition 5.5.
G-conjugate we may assume that eT := T ∩ eG is a maximal torus of eG isomorphic to
Cq−ε × Cq−ε. By Remark 4.9(ii) in conjunction with the fact that N eG(eT )/eT ∼= D12,
and possibly after eG-conjugation, there exists an automorphism ˜a of eG (e.g. the ﬁeld
automorphism of eG) such that Out(eG) = h˜a Inn(eG)i, ˜a(eT ) = eT , and every element of
N eG(eT ) can be written as nt with t ∈ eT and n ∈ N eG(eT ) such that ˜a(n) = n.
Now the ﬁeld automorphism Fp acts on eG and hence, since Out(eG) = h˜a Inn(eG)i, there
is some k ∈ N and g ∈ eG such that Fp acts as ˜akcg on eG. Then a := Fpcg−1 ﬁxes eG and
eT , and hence T since T = CG(eT ) by Lemma 5.17. Moreover, Out(G) = ha Inn(G)i.
Now let x ∈ NG(T ). Following Proposition 5.18 it holds that NG(T ) = N eG(eT )T , and
hence x = ms for some m ∈ N eG(eT ) and s ∈ T . Now we have m = nt for suitable elements
t ∈ eT and n ∈ N eG(eT ) such that ˜a(n) = n. But then x = nts ∈ nT and

a(x) = a(nts) = ˜ak(n)a(ts) = na(ts) ∈ nT,

so a(x) and x coincide modulo T , i.e., a acts trivially on NG(T )/T .

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.22. Let B = B0 be the principal 3-block of G. Then Aut(G)B = Aut(G)
acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. We go through the distinct cases in Proposition 5.19. Let (R, ϕ) be a B-weight of
G. If R = O3(T ) for a maximal torus T of G of type T2,ε, then by Proposition 5.19(iii)
the G-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ) is uniquely determined by B and the isomorphism type
of R. Hence, it stays invariant under Aut(G).

Suppose now that R is as in Proposition 5.19(i). Then by Lemma 5.20 the group R is
uniquely determined up to G-conjugation. Hence, we may assume that R is contained in
the maximal subgroup of G isomorphic to G2(q) as in Proposition 5.5 and has the same
form as in the proof of Proposition 4.34 for case (iii). As in that proof, the element ρ in
Lemma 5.20 can be chosen such that ρ ∈ NKε(R) and Fp acts trivially on ρ. Moreover,
R is stabilized by Fp. According to Proposition 5.19(i) the character ϕ corresponds to
one of the two extensions St± of the Steinberg character of NHε /R CG(R) ∼= Sp2(3) to
NG(R)/R CG(R). As in the proof of Proposition 4.34 one shows that Fp leaves both St+
and St− invariant. In particular, the G-conjugacy class of (R, ϕ) is ﬁxed by Aut(G).

Finally, we suppose that R ∈ Syl3(G). Then from Proposition 5.19 it is known that

NG(R)/R CG(R) ∼= C2 × C2.

We prove that there exists a ∈ Aut(G)R which acts trivially on NG(R)/R CG(R) and with
Out(G) = ha Inn(G)i. Following the proof of [5, (1A)] we may assume that NG(R) is

34

contained in NG(T ) for some maximal torus T of type Tε, and where in addition NG(T ) =
hT, ρ, τ, σi for suitable ρ, τ, σ ∈ G such that R = hO3(T ), σi, σ has order 3 modulo T ,
ρT generates the center of NG(T )/T ∼= D12, and τ −1στ coincides with σ−1 modulo T .
Moreover, by the same reference CG(R) ⊆ T , NG(R) = hR CG(R), ρ, τ i, and we have

NG(R)/R CG(R) = hρR CG(R)i × hτ R CG(R)i.

By Lemma 5.21 there exists ˜a ∈ Aut(G)T such that Out(G) = h˜a Inn(G)i and ˜a acts
trivially on NG(T )/T . Since R˜a 6 NG(T ) and R is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G and hence
of NG(T ), there exists y ∈ NG(T ) such that R˜ay = R, i.e., the automorphism a := ˜acy ∈
Aut(G) stabilizes R, so in particular it acts on NG(R)/R CG(R). Moreover, it holds that

ha Inn(G)i = h˜a Inn(G)i = Out(G).

Since NG(T ) = hT, ρ, τ, σi and ρ, τ, σ ∈ NG(R), we may assume that y ∈ T . We prove
that a acts trivially on NG(R)/R CG(R). Since ρ, τ ∈ NG(T ), we have

cy(ρ) = yρy−1 = ρρ−1yρy−1 ∈ ρT,

and analogously cy(τ ) ∈ τ T . Hence, it follows that a(ρ) ∈ ρT and a(τ ) ∈ τ T since ˜a acts
trivially on NG(T )/T .

Let us suppose that a(ρR CG(R)) = τ R CG(R). Then a(ρ) = τ xσi for some x ∈ T and
i ∈ {0, 1, 2} since R = hO3(T ), σi and CG(R) ⊆ T . It follows that ρ ≡ a(ρ) ≡ τ σi mod T,
i.e., τ ≡ ρσ−i mod T . Since ρT ∈ Z(NG(T )/T ), we conclude that
σ−1 ≡ τ −1στ ≡ σiρ−1σρσ−i ≡ σ mod T

in contradiction to the order of σ being 3 modulo T . Similar arguments prove that a
stabilizes every element of NG(R)/R CG(R), and hence the weight (R, ϕ).

For non-principal 3-blocks of G with non-abelian defect groups An showed the following:

Proposition 5.23. Let B be a non-principal 3-block of G with non-abelian defect groups.
Then |W(B)| = 3. Moreover, if (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G and θ is an irreducible con-
stituent of ϕ|R CG(R), then θ is linear and up to G-conjugation one of the following holds:
such that R 6 Lε 6 Hε, CG(R) = Z(Hε) ∼= Cq2+εq+1, NG(R) = NMε(R),

(i) R ∼= 31+2

+

NHε(R)/R CG(R) ∼= Sp2(3), | NG(R) : NHε(R)| = 2, NG(R)θ = NHε(R) and

ϕ = (eθ · St)NG(R),

where St denotes the inﬂation of the Steinberg character of NHε(R)/R CG(R) and eθ

is an extension of θ to NG(R)θ. The character ϕ is uniquely determined by R and
B, and there exists exactly one G-conjugacy class of such B-weights in G.

(ii) R ∈ Syl3(G) with R 6 Hε, CG(R) = Z(Hε) ∼= Cq2+εq+1, NHε(R)/R CG(R) ∼= C2,

NG(R)/R CG(R) ∼= C2 × C2, NG(R)θ = NHε(R), and

where ξ ∈ Irr(NG(R)θ/R CG(R)) and eθ is an extension of θ to NG(R)θ.

Proof. This follows from [5, (1A)] and the proof of [5, (3B)].

(cid:3)

ϕ = (eθ · ξ)NG(R),

In order to understand the action of Aut(G) on the 3-weights of G described in Propo-

sition 5.23 above we need the following lemma:

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

35

Lemma 5.24. Let R be as in Proposition 5.23(ii). Then Hε = U × Z(Hε)3′ for some
subgroup U 6 Hε such that NHε(R) = NU (R) × Z(Hε)3′. More precisely,

for some x ∈ U with x2 ∈ R.

NHε(R) = hR, xi × Z(Hε)3′

Proof. By the proof of [5, (3B)] there exists a subgroup U 6 Hε such that we have
Hε = U × Z(Hε)3′ and NHε(R) = NU (R) × Z(Hε)3′. Now by Proposition 5.23(ii) it holds
that CHε(R) = Z(Hε) and NHε(R)/R CHε(R) ∼= C2. Since R is a Sylow 3-subgroup of G
and hence of Hε, we have Z(Hε)3 6 R. Thus, R CHε(R) = R Z(Hε) = R × Z(Hε)3′, so

NU (R)/R ∼= NHε(R)/R CHε(R) ∼= C2,

which proves the claim.

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.25. Suppose that B is a non-principal 3-block of G of non-abelian defect.
Then Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. Let (R, ϕ) be a B-weight of G. We go through the cases in Proposition 5.23. If
R ∼= 31+2

+ , then by Proposition 5.23(i) Aut(G)B ﬁxes [(R, ϕ)]G.

Suppose now that R ∈ Syl3(G) such that R 6 Hε and let θ be an irreducible constituent
of ϕ|R CG(R). Then by Proposition 5.23(ii) the character ϕ is of the form ηNG(R) for some
extension η of θ to NG(R)θ. Let a ∈ Aut(G) be such that Ra = R and Ba = B. Moreover,
let b be the 3-block of R CG(R) containing θ. Then b has defect group R ∈ Syl3(G), and
hence by [27, Lemma 4.13] also B ∈ Bl3(G | R). Since a ﬁxes B, it follows that ba
induces B, so b and ba of R CG(R) must be conjugate under NG(R) by Brauer’s extended
ﬁrst main theorem [27, Thm. 9.7], and hence also their canonical characters θ and θa
are NG(R)-conjugate. Without loss of generality we may thus assume that θa = θ. Let
x ∈ Hε be as in Lemma 5.24, i.e., such that NHε(R) = hR, xi × Z(Hε)3′ and x2 ∈ R. From
Proposition 5.23(ii) it follows that NG(R)θ = NHε(R), so

a−1(x) = xa ∈ (NG(R)θ)a = NG(R)θa = NG(R)θ = hR, xi × Z(Hε)3′.

Suppose that xa = v · z for some v ∈ hR, xi and z ∈ Z(Hε)3′. Then

v2 · z2 = (xa)2 = (x2)a ∈ Ra = R.

Since v2 ∈ R, we also have z2 ∈ R. But as Z(Hε) ∼= Cq2+εq+1 (cf. Proposition 5.23(ii)), it
follows that Z(Hε)3′ has odd order. Hence, we conclude that z2 can only be contained in
the 3-group R if z = 1. Thus, xa ∈ hR, xi, so a−1 and a act on hR, xi, and we may write
a(x) = rx for some r ∈ R.

Now there exist exactly two extensions of θ to NG(R)θ, say θ+ and θ− with θ+(x) = 1
and θ−(x) = −1 (for this recall that x2 ∈ R and θ is a linear character of R CG(R) with
R in its kernel). We write θ±(x) = ±1. It holds that

(θ±)a(c) = θ±(a(c)) = θ(a(c)) = θa(c) = θ(c)

for all c ∈ R CG(R), so (θ±)a are extensions of θ to NG(R)θ. Moreover,

(θ±)a(x) = θ±(a(x)) = θ±(rx) = θ±(r)θ±(x) = θ±(x) = ±1,

36

so we have (θ±)a = θ±. Denote by ψ+ and ψ− the induced characters (θ+)NG(R) and
(θ−)NG(R), respectively. Then ϕ ∈ {ψ+, ψ−}, and we have

(ψ+)a = ((θ+)NG(R))a = ((θ+)a)NG(R) = (θ+)NG(R) = ψ+,
and analogously, (ψ−)a = ψ−, so (R, ϕ) is left invariant by a as claimed.

(cid:3)

We next consider 3-blocks of abelian defect.

Proposition 5.26. Let B be a 3-block of G with a non-cyclic abelian defect group D.
Then the following statements hold:

(i) The centralizer CG(D) =: T is a maximal torus of G of type Tε or T2,ε, D = O3(T )

and NG(D) = NG(T ).

(ii) Consider Irr(T ) as an abelian group and ﬁx an isomorphism ˆ: T −→ Irr(T ). Up to
G-conjugation there exists a unique 3′-element s ∈ T and a 3-block b of T = CG(D)
with bG = B such that θ := ˆs ∈ Irr(T ) is the canonical character of b.

(iii) For θ and s as in (ii) we have NG(T )θ/T ∼= CW (T )(s), where W (T ) := NG(T )/T .

Proof. Part (i) follows from [5, (1A)] since being a defect group of B the 3-group D is
radical in G (e.g. [27, Cor. 4.18]). Statements (ii) and (iii) are part of [12, Prop. 5.8]. (cid:3)

Proposition 5.27. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) for a maximal torus
T of G of type T2,ε. Then Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. Suppose that (R, ϕ) is a B-weight. In consequence of Lemma 2.4 we may assume
that R = O3(T ) with NG(R) = NG(T ) by Proposition 5.26(i). Let s ∈ T , θ = ˆs and
b ∈ Bl3(T ) be as in Proposition 5.26(ii), so NG(T )θ/T ∼= CW (T )(s) for W (T ) = NG(T )/T .
Since B is non-principal, we have s 6= 1. Then by [12, Lemma 3.4] up to isomorphism it
holds that CW (T )(s) ∈ {{1}, C3}. We now conclude as in the proof of Proposition 5.16. (cid:3)

In the following we concentrate on the case of 3-blocks of G that have a defect group
O3(T ) for a maximal torus T of G of type Tε and reduce this to a question on 3-weights

isomorphic to Cq−ε × Cq−ε. As observed earlier, we have

of G2(q). We let eG = GFq ∼= G2(q) be a maximal subgroup of G as in Proposition 5.5 and
we ﬁx a maximal torus T of G of type Tε such that eT := T ∩ eG is a maximal torus of eG
NG(T )/T ∼= N eG(eT )/eT ∼= D12,
such that by Proposition 5.18 it holds that NG(T ) = N eG(eT )T .
Furthermore, we deﬁne R := O3(T ) and eR := O3(eT ). Now let B be a 3-block of G with

defect group R. Since B has abelian defect, it follows from Lemma 2.4 that a 3-subgroup
Q 6 G is G-conjugate to R whenever there exists a B-weight with ﬁrst component Q.

If (R, ϕ) is a B-weight of G and θ ∈ Irr(T ) is an irreducible constituent of ϕ|T , then

B = bl(θ)G following Construction 2.3.

eG. Our objective is to relate the B-weight (R, ϕ) of G to

Let us now deﬁne eB := bl(θ| eT )
a (set of) eB-weight(s) of eG. To this end we examine the restriction of the weight character
ϕ to N eG(eT ). In this connection the irreducible characters of T will play a key role, whence

we ﬁx the following parametrization for Irr(T ):

With the linear map θ0 deﬁned by θ0(z) = exp(2πi/(q3 − ε)) we obtain

The following series of lemmata will allow us to handle all situations which may occur

only if | NG(T )θ : T | is divisible by 3.

when restricting a character ϕ coming from a B-weight (R, ϕ) of G to N eG(eT ).
Lemma 5.29. Suppose that θ ∈ Irr(T ). Then eT is contained in the kernel of θ if and
6 in W (T ). We set ω := ¯ω2. By application of Lemma 5.1 it follows that eT ⊆ ker(θ)

if and only if ω leaves θ invariant, which proves the claim since ω and ω−1 are the only
elements of W (T ) ∼= D12 of order 3.
(cid:3)

Proof. We consider the element ¯ω ∈ W (T ) = NG(T )/T corresponding to the reﬂection
ωr1ωr3ωr4ωr2. Such an element exists in W (T ) as a result of Lemma 5.2, and it has order

Lemma 5.30. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) and suppose that θ ∈
Irr(T ) is the canonical character of a 3-block b of T such that bG = B. Moreover, set

eθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ). Then (at least) one of the following situations occurs:

(i) NG(T )θ = T ,
(ii) NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ,
(iii) NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ | = 2.
Proof. Suppose that neither (i) nor (ii) hold. We show that (iii) holds in this case. The
3-block b has defect group O3(T ), whence it follows from [27, Thm. 9.22] that 3 does not
divide | NG(T )θ : T |. In particular, up to isomorphism we have

NG(T )θ/T ∈ {C2, C2 × C2}

since NG(T )/T ∼= D12. The group NG(T )/T contains exactly two elements of order 3,
which are given by ω and ω−1, where ω is as in the proof of Lemma 5.29. We prove that
ω 6∈ NG(T )eθ. To this end we assume the contrary, i.e., ω ∈ NG(T )eθ. Write θ = θi
0 for
suitable parameters i and j. By Lemma 5.1 it follows that

or, equivalently, i ≡ i + j(q2 + εq + 1) mod q − ε and j ≡ −i − 2j mod q − ε. These
conditions are fulﬁlled if and only if 3j ≡ 0 mod q − ε and i ≡ 0 mod q − ε. But θ is the

38

canonical character of the 3-block b, whence in particular we have (q − ε)3 | j, so in fact

j ≡ 0 mod q − ε. Hence, eT ⊆ ker(θ) and Lemma 5.29 implies that 3 divides | NG(T )θ : T |,

a contradiction. Thus, | NG(T )eθ : T | divides 4.

We go through the three cases speciﬁed in Lemma 5.30. Case (i) may be treated easily:

(cid:3)

Proposition 5.31. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) and θ ∈ Irr(T ) be the
canonical character of a 3-block b of T with bG = B and NG(T )θ = T . Then |W(B)| = 1.
In particular, Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

Proof. This follows immediately from Construction 2.3 and Lemma 2.4, which imply that
up to G-conjugation for any B-weight (Q, ϕ) we have Q = O3(T ) and ϕ = θNG(T ).
(cid:3)

We now turn towards cases (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 5.30. Application of Proposition 5.18

easily yields the following:

Lemma 5.32. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) and θ ∈ Irr(T ) be the

canonical character of a 3-block b of T with bG = B. Set eθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ).
(i) If NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ, then we also have N eG(eT )θ = N eG(eT )eθ.
(ii) If NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ| = 2, then we also have N eG(eT )θ/eT ∼= C2
and | N eG(eT )eθ : N eG(eT )θ| = 2.

Lemma 5.33. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) and let θ ∈ Irr(T ) be the
canonical character of a 3-block b ∈ Bl3(T ) with bG = B. Then θ extends to NG(T )θ. In
particular, Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) only consists of extensions of θ.

Proof. Clearly, the stabilizer of b in NG(T ) is given by NG(T )θ. The 3-block b has defect
group O3(T ) ∈ Syl3(T ), and since by assumption bG = B has defect group O3(T ) as well,
for the stabilizer NG(T )θ of b in NG(T ) we have | NG(T )θ : T |3 = 1 in consequence of [27,
Thm. 9.22]. Hence, NG(T )θ/T is isomorphic to one of the 3′-subgroups

{1}, C2 and C2 × C2

of D12. If NG(T )θ/T is cyclic, then θ extends to NG(T )θ by [17, Problem 6.17]. Thus, we
suppose that NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 × C2:

By Proposition 5.26 the canonical character θ of b corresponds via an isomorphism be-
tween Irr(T ) and T to a semisimple 3′-element s ∈ T and we have NG(T )θ/T ∼= CW (T )(s).
Since θ is stabilized by the non-trivial element of the center of NG(T )/T , which acts on T
and Irr(T ) by inversion, it follows that θ = θ−1 6= 1T . According to Lemma 5.30 we have

NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ,

and from Lemma 5.29 we know that eθ is not the trivial character of eT , so eθ is of order 2
as well. Then by Remark 4.36 there exist n1, n2 ∈ N eG(eT ) with [n1, n2] = 1 and n2
2 ∈ eT
such that N eG(eT )eθ = heT , n1, n2i. But then

1, n2

NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ = T N eG(eT )eθ = hT, n1, n2i

by Proposition 5.18. As in Remark 4.36 it follows that θ extends to NG(T )θ.

Now since NG(T )θ/T is abelian in any case, it follows by Gallagher [17, Cor. 6.17] that
(cid:3)

Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) only consists of extensions of θ, which concludes the proof.

is the canonical character of a 3-block b of T with bG = B. Set eθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ) and
(i) Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ) only consists of extensions of eθ, and
(ii) any element of Irr(N eG(eT )θ | eθ) can be obtained as the restriction of a character in
Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ) to N eG(eT )θ.
In particular, the characters in Irr(N eG(eT )θ |eθ) are invariant under N eG(eT )eθ-conjugation.
ψ ∈ Irr(N eG(eT )) is an irreducible constituent of ϕ| N eG( eT ), then ψ lies aboveeθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ).
In particular, if O3(T ) ⊆ ker(θ), then O3(eT ) is contained in the kernel of ψ.
Proof. Let r, ei > 0 and ψi ∈ Irr(N eG(eT )) for i ∈ {1, . . . , r} with ψi 6= ψj if i 6= j be such

Proof. This follows from Proposition 5.18, Remark 4.36 and Gallagher’s theorem.

for some f ∈ N>0, t = | NG(T ) : NG(T )θ | and θ1 = θ, θ2, . . . , θt the NG(T )-conjugates of
θ. Now let i ∈ {1, . . . , r} be such that ψ = ψi. Then ψ| eT is a summand of ϕ| eT = (ϕ|T )| eT ,
so θj | eT is a constituent of ψ| eT for some j. Since

Proposition 5.36. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group R = O3(T ) and suppose
that (R, ϕ) is a B-weight. Moreover, denote by θ ∈ Irr(T ) an irreducible constituent of

NG(T ) = N eG(eT )T
by Proposition 5.18, the character θj is in fact conjugate to θ via an element of N eG(eT ),
so in particular it follows that (θj)| eT andeθ = θ| eT are N eG(eT )-conjugate. Hence, by Cliﬀord
theory the character eθ is a constituent of ψ| eT as claimed.
If now O3(T ) ⊆ ker(θ), then also O3(eT ) ⊆ ker(eθ), and since O3(eT ) is normal in N eG(eT ),
it lies in the kernel of each N eG(eT )-conjugate ofeθ, which proves the claim.
ϕ|T and deﬁne eθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ) and eϕ := ϕ| N eG( eT ).
(i) If NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ, then eϕ is irreducible.
(ii) If NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ | = 2, then eϕ is the sum of two distinct
irreducible characters of N eG(eT ) of the same degree.
In particular, if χ is an irreducible constituent of eϕ, then (eR, χ) is a eB-weight for eG,
where eB = bl(eθ)
eG with defect group eR = O3(eT ).

(cid:3)

By Construction 2.3 it holds that ϕ = ψNG(T ) for some ψ ∈ Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) satisfying
ψ(1)3 = | NG(T )θ : T |3, and the 3-block bl(θ) with bl(θ)G = B has canonical character
θ. By Lemma 5.33 the set Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) only consists of extensions of θ. In particular,
ψ(1) = 1, and thus

ϕ(1) = | NG(T ) : NG(T )θ |.

Now consider the restriction ψi| eT for i ∈ {1, . . . , r}. By Lemma 5.35 all characters ψi lie

above eθ, so by Cliﬀord theory [17, Thm. 6.5] there exist fi > 0 such that
where t = | N eG(eT ) : N eG(eT )eθ | andeθ1 =eθ, . . . ,eθt are the N eG(eT )-conjugates ofeθ. Using this

decomposition the degree of ϕ is given by

ψi| eT = fi

tXj=1eθj,
tXj=1eθj(1) = | N eG(eT ) : N eG(eT )eθ |

If NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ, then it follows easily that | NG(T ) : NG(T )θ | = | N eG(eT ) : N eG(eT )eθ |,

so comparison of the two formulae for ϕ(1) yields

ϕ(1) = eϕ(1) =

Suppose hence that NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ | = 2 as in (ii). It follows

that is, r = 1 and e1 = f1 = 1. Hence, eϕ = ψ1 is irreducible as claimed in (i).

so in this case we have

Let us go into more detail. As observed above, it holds that ϕ = ψNG(T ) for some linear

eifi = 2, whence eϕ must be the sum of at most two irreducible
extension ψ ∈ Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) of θ. By Proposition 5.18 we have NG(T ) = NG(T )θ N eG(eT ),
since NG(T )θ ∩ N eG(eT ) = N eG(eT )θ. Moreover, since NG(T )θ (cid:0) NG(T )eθ (cid:0) NG(T ), we have

for x ∈ N eG(eT )eθ, where we have ˙ψ(h) = ψ(h) if h ∈ N eG(eT )θ and ˙ψ(h) = 0 else. Now for
x ∈ eT it follows that
for all n ∈ N eG(eT )eθ, so
by Lemma 5.32(ii). Thus, any constituent of Υ lies above eθ, so in particular any such
linear constituents lying above eθ, say
for χ1, χ2 ∈ Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ). Since N eG(eT )θ has index 2 in N eG(eT )eθ, it is normal in N eG(eT )eθ.
In particular, for x, n ∈ N eG(eT )eθ we have
x ∈ N eG(eT )θ.
nxn−1 ∈ N eG(eT )θ
Thus, Υ(x) = 0 whenever x ∈ N eG(eT )eθ \ N eG(eT )θ. But Υ is the sum of the two linear
eϕ = ΥN eG( eT ) = (χ1 + χ2)N eG( eT ) = (χ1)N eG( eT ) + (χ2)N eG( eT ).
Now χ1, χ2 ∈ Irr(N eG(eT )eθ | eθ) are distinct, and following Cliﬀord correspondence [17,
Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ) −→ Irr(N eG(eT ) |eθ), ϑ 7−→ Ind

belongs to eB = bl(eθ)
Lemma 5.30 that | NG(T )eθ : T |, and hence also | N eG(eT )eθ : eT |, is a divisor of 4. Since bl(eθ)

Proposition 5.37. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group R = O3(T ) and suppose
that (R, ϕ1) and (R, ϕ2) are B-weights. Then the characters ϕ1| N eG( eT ) and ϕ2| N eG( eT ) have
a common irreducible constituent if and only if ϕ1 = ϕ2.

Proof. Let θ1, θ2 ∈ Irr(T ) be irreducible constituents of ϕ1|T and ϕ2|T , respectively. Fol-
lowing Construction 2.3 we have bl(θ1)G = bl(θ2)G = B, whence by the extended ﬁrst
main theorem of Brauer [27, Thm. 9.7] the 3-blocks bl(θ1) and bl(θ2) are conjugate under
NG(R) = NG(T ), so in particular their canonical characters θ1 and θ2 are conjugate under
NG(T ). According to Cliﬀord [17, Thm. 6.5] all NG(T )-conjugates of θ1 occur with the
same multiplicity as irreducible constituents of ϕ1|T , so without loss of generality we may
assume that θ := θ1 = θ2.

In consequence of Proposition 5.31 the claim is trivially true if NG(T )θ = T , so let us
assume from now that NG(T )θ (cid:1) T . In particular, from Lemma 5.30 we deduce that for

eθ := θ| eT ∈ Irr(eT ) one of the following holds:

(i) NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ,
(ii) NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ| = 2.
Following Construction 2.3 there exist ψ1, ψ2 ∈ Irr(NG(T )θ | θ) such that

for i = 1, 2. Let us suppose ﬁrst that NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ as in (i) above. In particular,fϕ1
andfϕ2 are irreducible as shown in Proposition 5.36. As in the proof of Proposition 5.36
Since NG(T )θ = NG(T )eθ, we also have N eG(eT )θ = N eG(eT )eθ by Lemma 5.32(i), whence the

Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ) −→ Irr(N eG(eT ) |eθ), ϑ 7−→ Ind

Both ψ1 and ψ2 are extensions of θ to NG(T )θ, so there exists η ∈ Irr(NG(T )θ/T ) such
that ψ2 = ψ1 · η. Now suppose that

that n = tm. It follows that

and let n ∈ NG(T )θ. Since NG(T )θ = T N eG(eT )θ, there exist t ∈ T and m ∈ N eG(eT )θ such

θ(t)ψ1(m)η(nT ) = ψ1(n)η(nT ) = ψ2(n) = θ(t)ψ2(m) = θ(t)ψ1(m),

and since ψ1 and θ are linear, we have ψ1(m), θ(t) 6= 0, so η(nT ) = 1, that is, η = 1NG(T )θ/T
in this case. Hence, ψ1 and ψ2 agree, and thus ϕ1 = ϕ2 as claimed.

Let us ﬁnally suppose that NG(T )θ/T ∼= C2 and | NG(T )eθ : NG(T )θ | = 2 as in case
(ii) above. In the proof of Proposition 5.36 we observed that there exist linear characters

χ11, χ12, χ21, χ22 ∈ Irr(N eG(eT )eθ |eθ) with χ11 6= χ12 and χ21 6= χ22 such that

Hence, by Lemma 5.34 it is invariant under the conjugation action of N eG(eT )eθ. Thus, for

there exist j, j′ ∈ {1, 2} such that (χ1j)N eG( eT ) = (χ2j ′)N eG( eT ), and thus χ1j = χ2j ′. By the
observation above it follows that

ψ1| N eG( eT )θ

= χ1j | N eG( eT )θ

= χ2j ′

| N eG( eT )θ

= ψ2| N eG( eT )θ

The same argumentation as for case (i) yields that ψ1 = ψ2, whence also ϕ1 = ϕ2.

let a ∈ Aut(G)B, eG. Since eR is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of the maximal torus eT of

stabilizes T , and since R is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of T , also Rag−1 = R.
particular (R, ϕag−1) is a B-weight for G with irreducible constituents of ϕag−1
by the set

eG = [(eRa, ψa)] eG = [(eR, ψag−1

[(eR, ψ)]a

Hence,

{ψag−1

{[(eR, ψ)] eG | ψ irreducible constituent of eϕ}a

| ψ irreducible constituent of eϕ}.
= {[(eR, ψag−1

= {[(eR, χ)] eG | χ irreducible constituent of ϕag−1

| N eG( eT )} ∈ fW(B),

Theorem 5.40. The bijection Λ in Proposition 5.38 is Aut(G)B, eG-equivariant.

so Aut(G)B, eG acts on fW(B) as claimed.
Proof. For a ∈ Aut(G)B, eG and [(R, ϕ)]G ∈ W(B) let g ∈ eG be such that eRa = eRg. Then

also Ra = Rg, and as in the proof of Proposition 5.39 we have

(cid:3)

Λ([(R, ϕ)]G)a = {[(eR, χ)] eG | χ irreducible constituent of ϕag−1

)]G)

| N eG( eT )}

= Λ([(R, ϕag−1
= Λ([(Ra, ϕa)]G)
= Λ([(R, ϕ)]a
G).

Hence, Λ is equivariant under the action of Aut(G)B, eG as claimed.

We can ﬁnally prove the following:

Corollary 5.41. Let B be a 3-block of G with defect group O3(T ) and NG(T )θ (cid:1) T for
the canonical character θ ∈ Irr(T ) of a root of B. Then Aut(G)B acts trivially on W(B).

The iBAW condition for G2(q) and 3D4(q)

45

Proof. Let a ∈ Aut(G)B. Since all maximal subgroups of G isomorphic to G2(q) are
G-conjugate, we may assume that a ∈ Aut(G)B, eG. Now let [(R, ϕ)]G ∈ W(B). By
Theorem 5.40 we have

[(R, ϕ)]a

G = Λ−1(Λ([(R, ϕ)]G)a),

where Λ denotes the bijection of Proposition 5.38. Since 3 ∤ q, in consequence of the

results obtained in Section 4.2.2 every eG-conjugacy class of 3-weights in eG belonging to a
3-block of eG of non-cyclic defect is left invariant by any automorphism of eG. In particular,
as for any constituent χ of the restriction of ϕ to N eG(eT ) the weight (eR, χ) belongs to a
3-block of eG with non-cyclic defect group given by eR according to Proposition 5.36. Thus,

G = Λ−1(Λ([(R, ϕ)]G)) = [(R, ϕ)]G,

Λ([(R, ϕ)]G)a = Λ([(R, ϕ)]G)

which completes the proof.

[(R, ϕ)]a

(cid:3)

In summary, the following holds:

Proposition 5.42. Let ℓ ∈ {2, 3} and let B be an ℓ-block of G of non-cyclic defect. Then
the iBAW condition (cf. Deﬁnition 2.6) holds for B.

Proof. By [5, Rmk. 1, (3B), (3G)] Alperin’s conjecture is true for B, so we may choose
a bijection ΩB : IBr(B) −→ W(B). By Propositions 5.10, 5.13, 5.14, 5.16, 5.22, 5.25,
5.27 and 5.31 and Corollary 5.41 the group Aut(G)B acts trivially on IBr(B) and W(B).
Accordingly, ΩB is Aut(G)B-equivariant, so Lemma 2.11 implies the claim.
(cid:3)
Proof of Theorem B. The simple group G = 3D4(q) is its own universal covering group,
and moreover the outer automorphism group of G is cyclic by Proposition 5.4.

Let ℓ be a prime dividing |G|. We may assume that ℓ 6= p, so ℓ divides at least one
of Φ1(q), Φ2(q), Φ3(q), Φ6(q) and Φ12(q). It follows that if ℓ > 5, then it divides exactly
one of Φ1(q), Φ2(q), Φ3(q), Φ6(q) or Φ12(q). Suppose that 5 6 ℓ | Φ12(q). Then a Sylow
ℓ-subgroup of G is contained in a maximal torus of G of type T3, so the Sylow ℓ-subgroups
of G are cyclic in this case (cf. Table 4). In particular, the iBAW condition holds for G
and ℓ by [21, Thm. 1.1].

Let now 5 6 ℓ | Φ1(q)Φ2(q)Φ3(q)Φ6(q). Then according to [12, Lemma 5.2] the ℓ-
blocks of G have either cyclic or maximal defect. In the case of cyclic ℓ-blocks the iBAW
condition holds again by [21, Thm. 1.1], while it has been proven to hold for 3-blocks of
maximal defect by Cabanes–Späth in [8, Cor. 7.6].

The case of non-cyclic ℓ-blocks of G for ℓ ∈ {2, 3} is covered by Proposition 5.42. (cid:3)
