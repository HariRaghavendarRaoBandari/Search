A Solution Theory for a General Class of SPDEs

Andr´e S¨uß∗ and Marcus Waurick†

Version of March 2, 2016

Abstract

In this article we present a way of treating stochastic partial diﬀerential equations with
multiplicative noise by rewriting them as stochastically perturbed evolutionary equations in
the sense of [18], where a general solution theory for deterministic evolutionary equations
has been developed. This allows us to present a uniﬁed solution theory for a general class
of SPDEs which we believe has great potential for further generalizations. We will show
that many standard stochastic PDEs ﬁt into this class as well as many other SPDEs such
as the stochastic Maxwell equation and time-fractional stochastic PDEs with multiplicative
noise on sub-domains of Rd. The approach is in spirit similar to the approach in [6], but
complementing it in the sense that it does not involve semi-group theory and allows for an
eﬀective treatment of coupled systems of SPDEs. In particular, the existence of a (regular)
fundamental solution or Green’s function is not required.

Introduction

The study of stochastic partial diﬀerential equations (SPDEs) attracted a lot of interest in the
recent years, with a wide range of equations already been investigated. A common theme in
the study of these equations is to attack the problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions to
SPDEs by taking solution approaches from the deterministic setting of PDEs and applying them to
a setting that involves a stochastic perturbation. Examples for this are the random-ﬁeld approach
that uses the fundamental solution to the associated PDE in [30, 5, 4], the semi-group approach
which treats evolution equations in Hilbert/Banach spaces via the semi-group generated by the
diﬀerential operator of the associated PDE, see [6] or [14, 15] for a treatise, and the variational
approach which involves evaluating the SPDE against test functions, which corresponds to the
weak solution of PDEs, see [27, 25, 24].

In this article we aim to transfer yet another solution concept of PDEs to the case when the
right-hand side of the PDE is perturbed by a stochastic noise term. This solution concept, see

[18] for a comprehensive study and [33, 23, 28] for possible generalizations, is of operator-theoretic
nature and takes place in an abstract Hilbert space setting. Its key features are establishing the
time-derivative operator as a normal, continuously invertible operator on an appropriate Hilbert
space and a positive deﬁniteness constraint on the partial diﬀerential operator of the PDE (realized
as an operator in space-time). Actually, this solution theory is a general recipe to solve a ﬁrst-order
(in time and space) system of coupled equations, and when solving a higher-order (S)PDE, it gets
reduced to such a ﬁrst-order system. In this sense the solution theory we will apply is roughly
similar in spirit to the treatment of hyperbolic equations in [9, 13], see also [2] for an application
to SPDEs.

We shall illustrate the class of SPDEs we will investigate using this approach. Throughout this
article let H be a Hilbert space, that we think of as basis space for our investigation. We assume
A to be a skew-self-adjoint, unbounded linear operator on H (i.e. iA is a self-adjoint operator on
H) which is thought of as containing the spatial derivatives. Furthermore, we denote by ∂0 the
time-derivative operator that will be constructed as a normal and continuously invertible operator
in Section 2.1. In particular, it can be shown that the spectrum of ∂−1
is contained in a ball of the
right half plane touching 0 ∈ C. Let for some r > 0, M : B(r, r) → L(H) be an analytic function,
where B(r, r) is the open ball in C with radius r > 0 centered at r > 0, and L(H) the set of
bounded linear operators on H. Then one can deﬁne via a functional calculus the linear operator
M (∂−1
0 , which will be speciﬁed below. The idea to
deﬁne this operator is to use the Fourier-Laplace transform as explicit spectral representation as
multiplication operator for ∂0 yielding a functional calculus for both ∂0 and its inverse. The role
that M (∂−1
0 ) plays is coupling the equations in the ﬁrst-order system. In applications, M (∂−1
0 )
also contains the information about the ‘constitutive relations’ or the ‘material law’.

Throughout this article we consider the following (formal) system of coupled SPDEs

σ(u(s))dW (s),

subject to suitable initial conditions, where u(t) admits values in a Hilbert space H, σ, b are
Lipschitz-continuous (in some suitable norms) functions on H and W is a cylindrical G-valued
Wiener process for some separable Hilbert space G (possibly diﬀerent from H). Though seeming
to represent ﬁrst-order equations, only, it is also possible to handle for instance the wave (or heat)
equation with (1.1) as well, see below. Moreover, note that M (∂−1
0 ) is an operator acting in space-
time and ∂0M (∂−1
0 ) is the composition of time diﬀerentiation and the application of the operator
M (∂−1

0 ).
In equation (1.1) possible boundary conditions are encoded in the domain of the (partial
diﬀerential) operator A. The way of dealing with this issue will also be further speciﬁed below.
The main achievement of this article is the development of a suitable functional analytic setting
for the class of equations (3.5), which allows us to discuss well-posedness issues of this class of
equations, that is, existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions on the input data.
Now we comment on a notational unfamiliarity in equation (1.1). Note that in (1.1) a stochastic
integral appears on the right-hand side of the equation instead of the more familiar formal product
σ(u(t))dW (t). We stress here that we are not aiming at solving a diﬀerent class of equations, but
in fact we deal with a more general formulation of the common way to write an SPDE. Let us
illustrate this point using two common examples, the stochastic heat equation and the stochastic
wave equation. The former is usually expressed in the classic formulation in the following way

∂t − ∆(cid:19)u(t) = b(u(t)) + σ(u(t))dW (t),
(cid:18) ∂

where ∆ = div grad is the Laplacian on the Euclidean space Rd with d ∈ N, and b, σ are linear or
nonlinear mappings on some Hilbert space, for instance some L2-space over Rd. See [6, Chapter
7] for more details on this formulation. We can reformulate this equation as a ﬁrst-order system
using the formal deﬁnition v := − grad ∂−1

In particular, H = L2(D)d+1

In a similar fashion, one can reformulate the stochastic wave equation, which in the classic

In comparison to the example of the stochastic heat equation, this formulation in terms of a ﬁrst-
order system is already well-known and heavily used. The main advantage of the formulation (1.1)
is that many more examples of PDEs in mathematical physics can be written in this form, see
[17]. The hand-waving arguments handling ∂−1
that we have used in the reduction to ﬁrst-order
systems will be made rigorous in Section 2.

This paper is structured in the following way. In Section 2 we present a brief overview over
the solution theory for PDEs which will be used in this article, in particular we explain the
construction of the time derivative operator and the concept of so-called Sobolev lattices. We
state the results and sketch the respective proofs referring to [18] for the details and highlight
some further generalizations.
In the following Section 3 we show how the solution theory for
deterministic PDEs carries over to the case of SPDEs which we think of as random perturbations
of PDEs. We clarify the way how to interpret the stochastic integral, and then present a solution
theory to SPDEs with additive and multiplicative noise.
In Section 4 we show using concrete
examples how this solution theory can be successfully applied to concrete SPDEs, some of which –
to the best of our knowledge – have not yet been solved in this level of generality. Furthermore, in
Section 5 we give some connections of this new solution concept with the already known approaches
to solve SPDEs. More precisely, we draw the connection of variational solutions of the heat
equation to the solutions obtained here in Subsection 5.1. Further in Subsection 5.2 for the
stochastic wave equation, we show that the mild solution derived via the semi-group method
coincides with the solution constructed in this exposition. We summarize our ﬁndings in Section
6.

In this article we denote the identify operator by 1 or by 1H and indicator functions by χK for

some set K.

2 The deterministic solution theory

In this section we will review the solution theory for a class of linear partial diﬀerential equations
developed in [18, Chapter 6] or [17]. This solution theory of partial diﬀerential equations relies
on 2 main observations: to establish the time-derivative operator as a normal and continuously
invertible operator on an appropriate Hilbert space and a positive deﬁniteness constraint on the
partial diﬀerential operators realized as operators in space-time.

2.1 Functional analytic ingredients

Let throughout this article ν > 0. This is a free parameter which controls the growth of solutions
to PDEs for large times. Consider the space
Hν,0(R) := {f ∈ L2

loc(R);(cid:0)x 7→ e−νxf (x)(cid:1) ∈ L2(R)}

of L2-functions with respect to the exponentially weighted Lebesgue measure exp(−2νx)dx. The
latter space becomes a Hilbert space if endowed with the scalar product

h·,·iν,0 : Hν,0(R) × Hν,0(R) → C,
(f, g) 7→ZR

f (x)∗g(x)e−2νxdx,

where ∗ denotes complex conjugation. Note that the operator exp(−νm) given by

exp(−νm) : Hν,0(R) → L2(R), f 7→ e−ν·f (·)

(2.1)

of multiplying with the function t 7→ e−νt is unitary from Hν,0(R) to H0,0(R)(= L2(R)).
f ∈ L1

Deﬁne dom (∂0,ν) := {f ∈ Hν,0(R); f ′ ∈ Hν,0(R)}, where f ′ is the distributional derivative of
(2.2)

∂0,ν : dom(∂0,ν) ⊆ Hν,0(R) → Hν,0(R), f 7→ f ′.

loc(R), and

Then this operator has the following properties, see also [10, Corollary 2.5].
Lemma 2.1. ∂0,ν is a continuously invertible linear operator with k∂−1
0,νk 6 1
Proof. Recall exp(−νm) from (2.1) is unitary. By the product rule we deduce the equality

ν and ℜ∂0,ν = ν.

∂0,ν = exp(−νm)−1(∂ + ν) exp(−νm),

(2.3)

where ∂ : H 1(R) ⊆ L2(R) → L2(R) is the (usual) distributional derivative operator realized in
L2(R). Indeed, for a smooth compactly supported function φ, we observe that

(cid:0)exp(−νm)−1(∂ + ν) exp(−νm)φ(cid:1) (x)
= exp(νx) ((∂ + ν) exp(−νm)φ) (x)
= exp(νx)(−νe−νxφ(x) + e−νxφ′(x) + ν exp(−νx)φ(x)) = φ′(x) = ∂0,νφ(x)

Since ∂ is skew-self-adjoint in L2(R) ([11, Chapter V, Example 3.14]), the spectrum of ∂ lies
on the imaginary axis. Hence, the operator ∂ + ν is continuously invertible. As, by (2.3), the
operators ∂ + ν and ∂0,ν are unitarily equivalent. The operator ∂0,ν is continuously invertible
as well. The norm estimate also follows from (2.3) as so does the formula ℜ∂0,ν = ν since
ℑ(∂0,ν) = exp(−νm)−1((−i)∂) exp(−νm), by the skew-self-adjointness of ∂.
Remark 2.2. By [10, Corollary 2.5 (d)], we have

for all f ∈ L2

ν(R).

Note that for a Hilbert space H, there exists a canonical extension of ∂0,ν to the space
Hν,0(R; H) of H-valued Hν,0(R)-functions by identifying Hν,0(R; H) with Hν,0(R) ⊗ H and the
extension of ∂0,ν is given by ∂0,ν ⊗ 1H.

An important tool in this article is the (Hilbert space valued) Fourier transformation

deﬁned by the unitary extension of

F : L2(R; H) → L2(R; H)

F φ(x) :=

1

√2π ZR

e−ixyφ(y)dy

(x ∈ R, φ ∈ L1(R; H) ∩ L2(R; H)),

to L2(R; H).
In fact, the norm preservation is the same as saying that Plancherel’s theorem
also holds for the Hilbert space valued case. Recall that the inverse Fourier transform satisﬁes
(F −1φ)(x) = (F ∗φ)(x) = (F φ)(−x).
Next, recall ([1, Volume 1, p.161-163]) that for the derivative ∂ : H 1(R) ⊆ L2(R) → L2(R), the
Fourier transformation realizes an explicit spectral representation for ∂ as multiplication operator
in the Fourier space:

where (mf )(x) := xf (x) denotes the multiplication-by-argument-operator in L2(R; H).

∂ = F ∗imF ,

We deﬁne the Fourier–Laplace transformation Lν := F exp(−νm) with exp(−νm) given in
(2.1). Then, Lν deﬁnes a spectral representation for ∂0,ν given in (2.2) (and hence also for ∂−1
0,ν ).
Indeed, we get ∂0,ν = L∗

ν (im + ν)Lν and
∂−1
0,ν = L∗

ν(cid:18) 1

im + ν(cid:19)Lν .

The latter formula carries over to (operator-valued)-functions of ∂−1
calculus for ∂−1

0,ν. We deﬁne

0,ν, that is, we set up a functional

M (∂−1

0,ν) := L∗

im + ν(cid:19)Lν,
where M : B(r, r) → L(H) is analytic and bounded, r > 1
Cc(R; H)
im + ν(cid:19) φ(x) := M(cid:18) 1

ν M(cid:18) 1

M(cid:18) 1

ix + ν(cid:19) φ(x).

(2.4)

2ν , as well as for all x ∈ R and φ ∈

Note that the right hand side is the application of the bounded linear operator M(cid:16) 1
ix+ν(cid:17) ∈ L(H)
to the Hilbert space element φ(x) ∈ H.
In principle, one could cope with (operator-valued) functions M being deﬁned on ∂B(r′, r′)\{0}
with r′ := 1/(2ν), only.
In fact, (2.4) is still possible. However, in the solution theory to be
developed in the next section, we want to establish causality for the solution operator, that is, the
solution vanishes up to time t if the data do (see below for the details). But, vanishing up to time
0 is intimately related to analyticity:

We denote the open complex right half plane by C+ = {it + ν; t ∈ R, ν > 0}.

Theorem 2.3 (Paley–Wiener, cf. [26, Chapter 19] and [17, Corollary 2.7]). Let H be a Hilbert
space, u ∈ L2(R; H). Then the following properties are equivalent:

1. C+ ∋ it + ν 7→ (Lν u)(t) ∈ H belongs to the Hardy–Lebesgue space

H2(H) := {f : C+ → H; f analytic,

f (i · +ν) ∈ L2(R; H) (ν > 0), sup

ν>0 kf (i · +ν)kL2 < ∞}

2. u = 0 on (−∞, 0).

We introduce Sobolev chains, which may be needed in the later investigation, see [18, Chapter
2], or [16]. These concepts are the natural generalizations of Gelfand triples to an inﬁnite chain of
rigged Hilbert spaces. We shall also refer to similar concepts developed in [12, 8] or, more recently,
[7].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let C : dom(C) ⊆ H → H be densely deﬁned and closed. If C is continuously
invertible, then we deﬁne Hk(C) to be the completion of (dom(C|k|),kCk·kH) for all k ∈ Z. The
sequence (Hk(C))k is called Sobolev chain associated with C.

Obviously, Hk(C) is a Hilbert space for each k ∈ Z. Moreover, it is possible to extend the oper-
ator C unitarily to an operator from Hk(C) to Hk−1(C). We will use these extensions throughout
and use the same notation. It can be shown that Hk(C∗)∗ can be identiﬁed with H−k(C) via the
dual pairing

Hk(C∗) × H−k(C) ∋ (φ, ψ) 7→D(C∗)k φ, C−kψEH

for all k ∈ Z, where we identify H with its dual space. Further, note that Hk ֒→ Hm as long as
k > m. Hence, the name “chain”.

Example 2.5. (a) A particular example for such operators C is the time-derivative ∂0,ν. We denote
Hν,k(R) := Hk(∂0,ν) for all k ∈ Z and correspondingly for the Hilbert-space-valued case.
A in some Hilbert space H. We build the Sobolev chain associated with C = A + 1.

(b) A second important example to be used later on is the case of a skew-self-adjoint operator

2.2 The solution theory

The solution theory which we will apply covers a large class of partial diﬀerential equations in
mathematical physics. We will summarize it in this section, and for convenience, we shall also
provide outlines of the proofs as well. For the whole arguments, the reader is referred to [18]
and [23, 33]. The following observation, a variant of coercitivity, provides the functional analytic
foundation.

Lemma 2.6. Let G be a Hilbert space, B : dom(B) ⊆ G → G a densely deﬁned, closed, linear
operator. Assume there exists c > 0 with the property that

ℜhBφ, φi > chφ, φi,

(2.5)

and

ℜhB∗ψ, ψi > chψ, ψi,

(2.6)
for all φ ∈ dom(B) and ψ ∈ dom(B∗). Then B−1 exists as an element of L(G), the space of
bounded linear operators on G and kB−1k 6 1/c.
Proof. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz-inequality, we can read oﬀ from the ﬁrst inequality (2.5) that
B is one-to-one. More precisely, we have for all φ ∈ dom(B)

Thus, B−1 is well-deﬁned on ran(B), the latter being a closed subset of G. In fact, take (ψn)n in
ran(B) converging to some ψ ∈ G. We ﬁnd (φn)n in dom(B) with Bφn = ψn. Then, again relying
on the inequality involving B, we get

ckφk 6 kBφk.

(2.7)

ckφn − φmk 6 kBφn − Bφmk = kψn − ψmk

(n, m ∈ N),

which shows that (φn)n is a Cauchy-sequence in G, and, thus, convergent to some φ ∈ G. The
closedness of B gives that φ ∈ dom(B) and Bφ = ψ ∈ ran(B) as desired.
Next, again by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we deduce that also B∗ is one-to-one, or ex-
pressed diﬀerently ker(B∗) = {0}. Thus, by the projection theorem, G = ker(B∗) ⊕ ran(B) =

6

{0} ⊕ ran(B) yielding that B is onto. The inequality for the norm of B−1 can be read oﬀ from
(2.7) by setting φ := B−1g for any g ∈ ran(B) = G:

This ﬁnishes the proof.

ckB−1gk 6 kBB−1gk = kgk.

Remark 2.7. Given a densely deﬁned closed linear operator A0 : dom(A0) ⊆ H → H, there exists
a closed, densely deﬁned (canonical) extension A to Hν,0(R; H) in the way that (Au)(t) := A0u(t)
for t ∈ R and u ∈ Cc(R; dom(A0)). Indeed, the construction can be done similarly to the extension
of the time-derivative by setting A := 1Hν,0(R) ⊗ A0. Then, if A0 is continuously invertible, then
so is A. The adjoint of A is the extension of the adjoint of A0. Due to these similarities there is
little use in distinguishing notationally A0 from its extension A. Hence, we will use throughout
the same notation for A0 and its extension.

The next result is the main existence and uniqueness theorem in the deterministic setting.

Theorem 2.8 ([18, Theorem 6.2.5], [17, Solution Theory]). Let H Hilbert space, A : dom(A) ⊆
H → H a skew-self-adjoint linear operator. For some r > 0, let M : B(r, r) → L(H) be a bounded
and analytic mapping. Assume that there exists c > 0 such that

ℜhz−1M (z)φ, φiH > ckφk2

H (z ∈ B(r, r), φ ∈ L(H)).

(2.8)

Then for all ν > 1/(2r) the operator

∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A : dom(A) ∩ dom(∂0,ν) ⊆ Hν,0(R; H) → Hν,0(R; H)

is closable with continuously invertible closure. Denoting Sν to be the inverse of the closure,

Sν :=(cid:0)∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν ) + A(cid:1)−1

,

we get that Sν is causal, that is, for a ∈ R and f, g ∈ Hν,0(R; H) the implication

f = g on (−∞, a) ⇒ Sνf = Sν g on (−∞, a)

(2.9)

holds true. Moreover, kSνk 6 c−1.
Proof. At ﬁrst we show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equation

(∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f

for given f ∈ Hν,0(R; H), which boils down to (closability and) continuous invertibility of the
(closure of the) partial diﬀerential operator B0 := ∂0,νM (∂−1
At ﬁrst, we observe that B0 with dom(B0) = dom(A) ∩ dom(∂0,ν) is closable. Indeed, it is
easy to check that ∂∗
0,ν )∗ − A with dense domain dom(B0) is a formal adjoint. Hence, B0
is closable. For the proof of the continuous invertibility of B := B0, we apply Lemma 2.6 with
G := Hν,0(R; H). To this end, take φ ∈ dom(B0) and compute

0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A.

ℜh(∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)φ, φi = ℜh∂0,νM (∂−1
0,ν )φ, φi + ℜhAφ, φi
= ℜh∂0,νM (∂−1
0,ν )φ, φi
= ℜh(im + ν)M(cid:18) 1
> chLν φ,Lν φi = chφ, φi,

im + ν(cid:19)Lνφ,Lν φi

where we have used that A is skew-self-adjoint (hence, ℜhAφ, φi = −ℜhφ, Aφi = −ℜhAφ, φi),
(2.4), (2.8) as well as Plancherel’s identity, that is, the unitarity of Lν. This inequality carries
over to all φ ∈ dom(B).

In order to use Lemma 2.6, we need to compute the adjoint of B. For this, note that (1+ǫ∂∗

0,ν)−1
converges strongly to the identity as ǫ → 0. So, ﬁx f ∈ dom(B∗) and ǫ > 0. Observe that
(1 + ǫ∂0,ν)−1 commutes with B0 and leaves the space dom(B0) invariant. Then we compute for
φ ∈ dom(B0)

hφ, (1 + ǫ∂∗

0,ν)−1B∗fi = h(1 + ǫ∂0,ν)−1φ, B∗fi
= hB0(1 + ǫ∂0,ν)−1φ, fi

ℜhB∗ψ, ψi > chψ, ψi.

Hence, Lemma 2.6 implies that B is continuously invertible, and we denote Sν := B−1. The norm
estimate for kSνk follows from Lemma 2.6.
The next step is to show causality, and here we only sketch the arguments and we refer to
[17, Section 2.2, Theorem 2.10] for the details. First of all, note that B commutes with time-
translation τhf := f (· + h) as it is also a function of ∂0,ν. In fact, one has τh = L∗
ν e(im+ν)hLν .
Hence, causality needs only being checked for a = 0 in (2.9). Moreover, by the linearity of Sν, it
suﬃces to verify the implication in (2.9) for v = 0. So, take u ∈ Hν,0(R; H) vanishing on (−∞, 0].
We have to show that Sνu also vanishes on (−∞, 0]. Observe that e−νmu ∈ L2(0,∞; H). Hence,
by the Paley–Wiener theorem Lνu = F e−νmu belongs to the Hardy–Lebesgue space of analytic
functions on the half plane being uniformly in L2(R; H) on any line parallel to the coordinate axis,

The operator Sν deﬁned in the previous theorem is also denoted as solution operator to the
PDE. The concept of causality is an action-reaction principle, i.e. only if there is some non-zero
action on the right-hand side of the equation, the solution can become non-zero.

8

Remark 2.9. (a) As it was pointed out in [18, p. 494], we can freely work with ∂0,ν in the PDE so
that instead of solving (∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f , we could also solve

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν ) + A)v = ∂−1

0,νf,

(2.10)

and obtain the original solution u = ∂0,νv. This will be advantageous when dealing with irregular
right-hand sides, especially stochastic ones.
(and scalar functions thereof)
commute with the solution operator Sν given in Theorem 2.8. Thus (see also [18, Theorem 6.2.5]),
the solution theory obtained in Theorem 2.8 carries over to Hν,k(R; H), that is, the solution
operator Sν admits a continuous linear extension to all Hν,k-spaces:

In particular, ∂−1

0

Sν ∈ L(Hν,k(R; H))

(k ∈ Z).
(b) It can be shown that for all ε > 0 and u ∈ dom(∂0M (∂−1
0 ) + A) we have that (1+ε∂0)−1u ∈
dom(∂0) ∩ dom(A), see [18, Theorem 6.2.5] or [33, Lemma 5.2].
(c) With the notion of Sobolev chains as introduced in the previous section, we may neglect
the closure bar in

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f.

(2.11)

Indeed, the latter equation holds in Hν,0(R; H), but, since

Hν,0(R; H)) ֒→ Hν,−1(R; H) ∩ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)) continuously,

we obtain equality (2.11) also in the space Hν,−1(R; H) ∩ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)). Moreover, for
u ∈ Hν,0(R; H), we have ∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν)u ∈ Hν,−1(R; H) and Au ∈ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)). Thus,

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = ∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν)u + Au.

In fact, in the proof of Theorem 2.8 we have shown that dom(∂0,ν) ∩ dom(A) is dense in

dom((∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A))

0,ν) + A). But, a sequence (un)n converging to u in
0,ν) + A)) converges to u particularly in Hν,0(R; H). So, since ∂0,ν : Hν,0(R; H) →

with respect to the graph norm of (∂0,νM (∂−1
dom((∂0,ν M (∂−1
Hν,−1(R; H) and A : Hν,0(R; H) → Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)) are continuous, we obtain

with limits computed in Hν,−1(R; H) ∩ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)).

We shall now sketch how to deal with initial value problems. In fact, until now we have only

considered equations like

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f,

that is, equations with a source term on the right-hand side, and some boundary conditions
encoded in the domain of the (partial diﬀerential) operator A, but no initial conditions. In fact,
we will show now, how to incorporate them into the right-hand side of the PDE. For a simple
case, we rephrase the arguments in [18, Section 6.2.5, Theorem 6.2.9].

Take u0 ∈ dom(A), and f ∈ Hν,0(R; H) with f vanishing on (−∞, 0]. Then, our formulation
for initial value problems is as follows. For the sake of presentation, we let M (∂−1
0,νM1
for some self-adjoint, non-negative M0 ∈ L(H) and some M1 ∈ L(H) satisfying νM0 + ℜM1 > c.
An example for this would be M0 = 1H and M1 = 0. Consider

0,ν) = M0 + ∂−1

(∂0,ν M0 + M1 + A)v = f − χ[0,∞)M1u0 − χ[0,∞)Au0.

Note that due to the exponential weight, we have χ[0,∞)M1u0 + χ[0,∞)Au0 ∈ Hν,0(R; H). The
solution theory in Theorem 2.8 gives us a unique solution v ∈ H0,ν(R; H). Moreover, v is supported
on [0,∞), due to causality.

9

Lemma 2.10. With the notation above, u := v + χ[0,∞)u0 solves the initial value problem

((∂0,ν M0 + M1 + A)u = f

(M0u)(0+) = M0u0.

on (0,∞)
in H−1(A + 1)

Proof. Note that on (0,∞) we get

f − χ[0,∞)M1u0 − χ[0,∞)Au0 = (∂0,ν M0 + M1 + A)(u − χ[0,∞)u0)

= ∂0,νM0(u − χ[0,∞)u0) + (M1 + A)(u − χ[0,∞)u0),

where these equalities hold in Hν,−1(R; H) ∩ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)). Hence, as ∂0,ν M0χ[0,∞)u0
vanishes on (0,∞), we arrive at

It remains to check whether the initial datum is attained. From the equation

f = (∂0,ν M0 + M1 + A)u on (0,∞).

(∂0,νM0 + M1 + A)v = f − χ[0,∞)M1u0 − χ[0,∞)Au0

we see that ∂0,νM0v ∈ Hν,0(R; H−1(A + 1)). Thus, M0v ∈ Hν,1(R; H−1(A + 1)). By the Sobolev
embedding theorem (see e.g. [10, Lemma 5.2]), we infer M0v ∈ C(R; H−1(A + 1)). In particular,
we get

with limits in H−1(A + 1). By causality, M0v(0−) = 0 and, thus, we arrive at

(M0v)(0−) = (M0v)(0+)

0 = M0(u − χ[0,∞)u0)(0+),

which gives (M0u)(0+) = M0u0, that is, the initial value is attained in H−1(A + 1).

The results above enable us to solve linear partial diﬀerential equations with initial conditions
just by looking at non-homogeneous problems with Hν,0 right-hand sides. A few comments are in
order.

Remark 2.11. (a) The solution operator in Theorem 2.8 is independent of ν, in the following
sense: let ν, µ be suﬃciently large and denote the corresponding solution operators by Sν and Sµ
respectively. Then for f ∈ Hν,0(R; H) ∩ Hµ,0(R; H) we have Sνf = Sµf , see e.g. [18, Theorem
6.1.4] or [29, Lemma 3.6] for a detailed proof. Therefore we shall occasionally drop the index ν in
the time-derivative or the solution operator if there is no risk of confusion.

(b) For the sake of presentation, we state the above treatment of PDE in a rather restricted way.
In fact the solution theory mentioned in Theorem 2.8 can be generalized to maximal monotone
relations A, see e.g. [28], or to non-autonomous coeﬃcients, see [23, 33]. For our purposes of
investigating random right-hand sides however, Theorem 2.8 is suﬃcient.

Now we present the last ingredient before turning to stochastic PDEs. We shall present a
perturbation result which will help us to deduce well-posedness of stochastic partial diﬀerential
equations, where we interpret the stochastic part as a nonlinear perturbation on the right-hand
side of the PDE. In order to do so, we give a deﬁnition of so-called evolutionary mappings, which
is a slight variant of the notions presented in [31, Deﬁnition 2.1] and [10, Deﬁnition 4.7].

Deﬁnition 2.12. Let H, G Hilbert spaces, ν0 > 0. Let

F : dom(F ) ⊆ \ν>0

Hν,0(R; H) → \ν>ν0

Hν (R; G),

where dom(F ) is supposed to be a vector space. We call F evolutionary (at ν0), if for all ν > ν0,
F satisﬁes the following properties

10

(i) F is Lipschitz-continuous as a mapping

F0,ν : dom(F ) ⊆ Hν,0(R; H) → Hν,0(R; G), φ 7→ F (φ),

(ii) kFkev,Lip := lim supν→∞ kFνkLip < ∞, with Fν := F0,ν .
The non-negative number kFkev,Lip is called the the eventual Lipschitz constant of F .

If, in addition, Fν leaves dom(Fν ) = dom(F )

Hν,0 invariant, then we call F invariant evolution-

ary (at ν0).

Similar to the solution operator Sν to certain partial diﬀerential equations (see Remark 2.11),

evolutionary mappings are independent of ν in the following sense:

Lemma 2.13. Let F be evolutionary at ν0 > 0. Assume that multiplication by the cut-oﬀ function
χ(−∞,a] leaves the space dom(F ) invariant for all a ∈ R, that is, for all a ∈ R, φ ∈ dom(F )

χ(−∞,a]φ ⊆ dom(F ).

(2.12)

Then Fν|dom(Fν )∩dom(Fµ) = Fµ|dom(Fν )∩dom(Fµ) for all ν > µ > ν0.
Proof. Take u ∈ dom(Fν )∩ dom(Fµ) and assume as a ﬁrst step, that χ(−∞,a]u = 0 for some a ∈ R.
By deﬁnition, there exists (φn)n in dom(F ) such that φn → u in Hµ,0(R; H). As dom(F ) is a
vector space and by being left invariant by multiplication by the cut-oﬀ function, we also have that
ψn := χ(a,∞)φn ∈ dom(F ) as well as ψn → u in Hµ,0(R; H). From ν > µ, we infer that ψn → u in
Hν,0(R; H). Hence, as Hν,0(R; G) and Hµ,0(R; G) are continuously embedded in L2

loc(R; G),

Fµ(u) = lim
n→∞

Fµ(ψn) = lim
n→∞

Fν(ψn) = Fν (u).

For general u ∈ dom(Fν ) ∩ dom(Fµ), note that the sequence (un)n∈N := (χ[−n,∞)u)n∈N converges
in both spaces Hν,0(R; H) and Hµ,0(R; H) by dominated convergence. The continuity of Fν and Fµ
implies convergence of (Fν (un))n∈N and (Fµ(un))n∈N in Hν,0(R; G) and Hµ,0(R; G), respectively.
Therefore we get equality of the respective limits by Fν (un) = Fµ(un) by the arguments in the ﬁrst
step of this proof, again by the fact that both spaces Hν,0(R; G) and Hµ,0(R; G) are continuously
embedded in L2

loc(R; G).

Remark 2.14. In both articles [31, Deﬁnition 2.1] and [10, Deﬁnition 4.7], where the notion of
evolutionary mappings was used, we assumed that the mappings under considerations are densely
deﬁned (and linear). Hence, the invariance condition is superﬂuous. But in the context of stochas-
tic partial diﬀerential equations, one should think of F to be a stochastic integral. This, however, is
only a Lipschitz continuous mapping, if the processes to be integrated are adapted to the ﬁltration
given by the integrating process. The adapted processes form a closed subspace of all stochastic
processes, and they will play the role of dom(Fν ). This shall be speciﬁed in the next section.

As the ﬁnal statement of this section, we provide the perturbation result which is applicable

to stochastic partial diﬀerential equations.

Corollary 2.15. Let H a Hilbert space, ν0 > 0. Assume that F is invariant evolutionary (at ν0)
as in Deﬁnition 2.12 for G = H. Let r > 1
, and suppose that M : B(r, r) → L(H) is analytic
2ν0
and bounded, satisfying

ℜhz−1M (z)φ, φiH > ckφk2
H ,

for all z ∈ B(r, r), all φ ∈ H and some c > 0. Assume that kFkev,Lip < c and that Fν is causal for
all ν > ν0. Furthermore suppose that for all ν > ν0, we have Sνφ ⊆ dom(Fν ), for all φ ∈ dom(Fν )
with Sν from Theorem 2.8.

Then the mapping

Φν : dom(Φν ) ⊆ dom(Fν ) → dom(Fν )

11

with domain

u 7→ (∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν ) + A)u + Fν (u)

dom(Φν ) =nu ∈ dom(Fν ); (∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u + Fν (u) ∈ dom(Fν )o

admits a Lipschitz-continuous inverse mapping deﬁned on the whole of dom(Fν ) for all ν > ν0
large enough. Moreover, Φ−1

is causal.

ν

Proof. Choose ν > ν0 so large such that kFνkLip < c and let f ∈ dom(Fν ). Now, u ∈ dom(Φν )
satisﬁes

(∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u + Fν (u) = f

if and only if u is a ﬁxed point of the mapping

Ψ : dom(Fν ) → dom(Fν ), x 7→ (∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)

−1

(f − Fν (x)) .

Note that, since dom(Fν ) is a vector space, Ψ is in fact well-deﬁned. Moreover, Ψ is a contraction,
by the choice of ν. Indeed, let u, v ∈ dom(Fν ) then

kΨ(u) − Ψ(v)k = k(∂0,νM (∂−1
= k(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)

so Ψ is strictly contractive as kFνkLip < c. Hence, the inverse of Φν is a well-deﬁned Lipschitz
continuous mapping, by the contraction mapping principle.
Next, we show causality of the solution operator. For this it suﬃces to observe that Ψ is
causal. But, by Theorem 2.8, Ψ is a composition of causal mappings, yielding the causality for Ψ
and, hence, the same for the solution mapping of the equation under consideration in the present
corollary.

ν on ν is in order.

As already mentioned, we use the above perturbation result to conclude well-posedness of
stochastically perturbed partial diﬀerential equations. In the application, we have in mind, the
invariance of dom(Fν ) under Sν is a consequence of causality. In fact, we will have that dom(Fν ) is
the restriction of Hν,0-functions to the class of predictable processes. A remark on the dependence

Remark 2.16. In order to show independence of ν, that is, Φ−1
µ f for f ∈ dom(Fν ) ∩

take f ∈ dom(Fν ) ∩ dom(Fµ) for ν, µ suﬃciently large as in Corollary 2.15. Then, with Ψν :=
(∂0,νM (∂−1
(f − Fν (·)) (and similarly for Ψµ), the proof of Corollary 2.15 shows that

Ψν(f ) = Sν(f − Fν (f )) = Sν(f − Fµ(f )) = Sµ(f − Fµ(f )) = Ψµ(f ),

by Remark 2.11(a) and Lemma 2.13. In particular, Ψν(f ) ∈ dom(Fν ) ∩ dom(Fµ). In the same
way, one infers that Ψn
µ (f ) are limits
of the same sequence in dom(Fν ) and dom(Fµ), respectively. Thus, as both the latter spaces are
continuously embedded into L2

µ(f ) for all n ∈ N. Consequently, Φ−1
loc(R; H) these limits coincide.

ν (f ) and Φ−1

ν (f ) = Ψn

3 Application to SPDEs

In this section we show how to apply the solution theory from Section 2.2 to an SPDE of the
form (1.1). The basic idea is to replace the Hilbert space H in Section 2.2 by L2(P) ⊗ H, where
L2(P) = L2(Ω, A , P) is the L2-space of a probability space (Ω, A , P) and H is the Hilbert space
where the (unbounded) operator A is thought of as being initially deﬁned. A typical choice would
be H = L2(D)d+1, for some domain D ⊆ Rd, and A being some diﬀerential operator, but also
more general operator equations are possible.
As already mentioned in the introduction, we consider the stochastic integral on the right-hand
side as a perturbation of the deterministic partial diﬀerential equation. Therefore we need to make
sense of the term

(cid:0)∂0M (∂−1

0 ) + A(cid:1)−1(cid:18)Z t

σ(u(s))dB(s)(cid:19).

0

In Section 3.1 we establish that this term is well-deﬁned, and after that, in Section 3.2, we can
use this to treat SPDEs with multiplicative noise using the ﬁxed-point argument carried out in
Corollary 2.15. In principle, using this idea, one can also treat SPDEs with additive noise, but a
slightly diﬀerent analysis in Section 3.3 also gives us a result on SPDEs with additive noise.

3.1 Treatment of the stochastic integral

The concept of stochastic integration we use in the following is the same as in [6], and we repeat
the most important points here.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Wiener process). Let G be a separable Hilbert space, (ek)k∈N an orthonormal
basis of G, (λk)k∈N ∈ ℓ1(N) with λk > 0 for all k ∈ N, and let (Wk)k∈N be an sequence of
independent real-valued Brownian motions. For t ∈ R+ we deﬁne the G-valued Wiener process,
by

∞

and we set W (t) = 0 for all negative times t ∈ R−.

W (t) =

Xk=1pλkWk(t)ek,

In order to make sense of stochastic integration we reinterpret the notion of a ﬁltration in an
operator-theoretic way. We will use the notation A 6 B for two bounded linear operators on a
Hilbert space H if hAx, xi 6 hBx, xi for all x ∈ H.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (Filtration and predictable processes). (a) Let H be Hilbert space, P = (Pt)t>0 is
called a ﬁltration on H, if for all t ∈ R+ the operator Pt is an orthogonal projection, Ps 6 Pt 6 1H
for all s 6 t.

(b) Let ν > 0, Z : R → H. We call Z predictable (with respect to P ), if

Z ∈ Hν,0(R; P ) := SP ,

where

SP := lin{χ(s,t]φ; φ ∈ ran(Ps), s, t ∈ R, s < t}

(3.1)

and the closure is taken in Hν,0(R; H).

(c) Let G be a Hilbert space, we say that Z : R → H ⊗ G is predictable (with respect to P ) with

values in G, if Z is predictable with respect to P ⊗ 1G := (Pt ⊗ 1G)t∈R.
Remark 3.3. In applications, H = L2(P) for some probability space (Ω, A , P) and (Pt)t∈R is given
by a family of nested σ-algebras (Ft)t∈R. More precisely,

Pt : L2(P) → L2(P), X 7→ E(X|Ft)

(t ∈ R).

(3.2)

In particular, if we are given a G-valued Wiener process W with underlying probability space
(Ω, A , P) as in Deﬁnition 3.1, the natural ﬁltration is given by Ft := σ(Wk(s); k ∈ N,−∞ < s 6 t),

13

t ∈ R. Thus, the corresponding family of projections PW = (Pt)t is then given as in (3.2). Hence,
SPW (see also (3.1)) reads

SPW = lin{χ(s,t]φ; φ ∈ ran(Ps), s, t ∈ R, s < t}

= lin{χ(s,t]φ; Psφ = φ, s, t ∈ R, s < t}
= lin{χ(s,t]φ; E(φ|Fs) = φ, s, t ∈ R, s < t}
= lin{χ(s,t]φ; φ is Fs-measurable, s, t ∈ R, s < t}.

Note that SPW are also called simple predictable processes.

In this case, one could also take

Ft(cid:17).

A = F∞ := σ(cid:16)St>0
For later use, we also have to show that the solution map as deﬁned in Section 2.2 does not
destroy the predictability. This is however a direct consequence of the causality of the solution map
stated in Theorem 2.8. For ease of presentation, we will freely identify H ⊗ H1 with H1 ⊗ H and
Hν,0(R; H) with Hν,0(R)⊗ H. In particular, this eﬀects the following loose notation: a continuous
operator M on H is then extended to a continuous linear operator on H1 ⊗ H by M ⊗ 1H1 (and
of course by 1H1 ⊗ M ), if we want to stress that it is extended at all (and not simply write M ).
Theorem 3.4. Let H, G be Hilbert spaces, P a ﬁltration on H. Let M : Hν,0(R; G) → Hν,0(R; G)
be a causal, continuous linear operator. Then the canonical extension of M to Hν,0(R; G) ⊗ H
leaves the space of predictable processes invariant, that is,

M ⊗ 1H [Hν,0(R; P ⊗ 1G)] ⊆ Hν,0(R; P ⊗ 1G).

Proof. By continuity of M , it suﬃces to prove (M⊗1H )[SP ⊗1G ] ⊆ Hν,0(R; P⊗1G). Let f ∈ SP ⊗1G .
By linearity of M ⊗ 1H, we may assume without loss of generality that f = χ(s,t]η for some
η = (Ps ⊗ 1G)(η) ∈ H ⊗ G and s, t ∈ R. Next, by the density of the algebraic tensor product of
H and G, we ﬁnd sequences (φn)n in H and (ψn)n in G with the property

But,

∞

η = (Ps ⊗ 1G)(η) = (Ps ⊗ 1G)

φn ⊗ ψn =

(Psφn) ⊗ ψn.

Xn=1

Xn=1

Thus, without restriction, we may assume that φn = Psφn for all n ∈ N. Since, by deﬁnition, the
predictable mappings form a closed subset of Hν,0(R; H ⊗ G) and M ⊗ 1H is continuous, it suﬃces
to prove that for all N ∈ N,

Xn=1
is predictable. By linearity of M ⊗ 1H, we are left with showing that (M ⊗ 1H)(cid:0)χ(s,t]φ ⊗ ψ(cid:1) is
predictable for all φ ∈ ran(Ps) and ψ ∈ G. Note that

(M ⊗ 1H) χ(s,t]

N

φn ⊗ ψn!

(M ⊗ 1H)(cid:0)χ(s,t]φ ⊗ ψ(cid:1) = (M (χ(s,t]ψ)) ⊗ φ.

Next, causality of M implies that spt M (χ(s,t]ψ) ⊆ [s,∞), where spt denotes the support of
a function. We conclude with the observation that M (χ(s,t]ψ) can be approximated by simple
functions in Hν,0(R; G) supported on (s,∞) only. Hence, (M (χ(s,t]ψ)) ⊗ φ is predictable.

Next, we come to the discussion of the stochastic integral involved:

a G-valued Wiener process. Let Z be a predictable stochastic process with respect to the natural
ﬁltration induced by W as in Remark 3.3 with values in L2(G, H), the space of Hilbert-Schmidt
operators from G to H. Then we deﬁne the stochastic integral of Z with respect to W for all
t ∈ R+ as follows

3.2 SPDEs with multiplicative noise

In this section we apply the solution theory presented in Section 2.2 to equations with a stochastic
integral. As already mentioned in the introduction, we consider equations of the form (1.1) with a
stochastic integral instead of the more common random noise term σ(u(t))dW (t). This formulation
is however in line with the usual way of formulating an SPDE, since in some sense we consider
“a once integrated SPDE” and we interpret the noise term ∂−1
0 (σ(u(t))dW (t)) as the stochastic
integral in Hilbert spaces with respect to a cylindrical Wiener process denoted by

∂−1

0 (cid:0)σ(u(t))dW (t)(cid:1) :=Z t

0

σ(u(s))dW (s).

As a matter of convenience, we treat the case of zero initial conditions ﬁrst. In Remark 3.9(b) we
shall comment on how non-vanishing initial data can be incorporated into our formulation.

Theorem 3.8 (Solution theory for (abstract) stochastic diﬀerential equations). Let H, G be
separable Hilbert spaces, and let W be a G-valued Wiener process with underlying probability space
(Ω, A , P). Assume that the ﬁltration P = (Pt)t on L2(P) is generated by W (see Remark 3.3).
Let r > 0, and assume that M : B(r, r) → L(H) is an analytic and bounded function, satisfying

ℜh(z−1M (z))φ, φiH > ckφk2
H ,

(3.4)

for all z ∈ B(r, r), φ ∈ H and some c > 0. Let A : dom(A) ⊆ H → H be skew-self-adjoint, and
σ : H → L2(G, H) with

kσ(u) − σ(v)kL2 6 Lku − vkH (u, v ∈ H)

for some L > 0.

Then there exists ν1 > 0 such that for all ν > ν1, and f ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H) the equation

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f +Z ·

0

σ(u(s))dW (s)

(3.5)

0 σ(Z)dW (s). By Theorem 3.7 and the Lipschitz
continuity of σ, we infer that F is invariant evolutionary with eventual Lipschitz constant being
0. Indeed, since W (t) = 0 for t < 0, we may write

admits a unique solution u ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H ). The solution does not depend on ν in the sense
of Remark 2.11.
Proof. We apply Corollary 2.15 for F : Z 7→ R ·
σ(u(s))dW (s) =Z ·

χ[0,∞)(s)σ(u(s))dW (s).

Z ·

0

0

But, for all ν > 0, s 7→ χ[0,∞)(s)σ(0) ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1L2(G;H)) and, therefore, we get for
u ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H)

kχ[0,∞)(·)σ(u(·))kHν,0(R;PW ⊗1L2(G;H))
6 kχ[0,∞)(·)σ(u(·)) − χ[0,∞)(·)σ(0)kHν,0(R;PW ⊗1L2(G;H)) + kχ[0,∞)(·)σ(0)kHν,0(R;PW ⊗1L2(G;H))
6 Lkχ[0,∞)(·)u(·)kHν,0(R;PW ⊗1H ) + kχ[0,∞)(·)σ(0)kHν,0(R;PW ⊗1L2(G;H)) < ∞.

Moreover, it is equally easy to see that

χ[0,∞)σ : Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H) → Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1L2(G;H)), u 7→ χ[0,∞)(·)σ(u(·))

is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant bounded by L. Hence, by Theorem 3.7, we obtain
that

Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H ) ∋ u 7→Z ·

0

σ(u(s))dW (s) ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H)

16

is Lipschitz continuous with eventual Lipschitz constant 0. By Theorem 3.4, we obtain that

Sν[dom(Fν )] = Sν[Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H )] ⊆ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗ 1H)

with Sν from Theorem 2.8. Hence, the assertion follows from Corollary 2.15. (The independence
of the solution of the parameter ν follows from Lemma 2.13 because the multiplication with a
cut-oﬀ function leaves the space of predictable processes invariant.)

Remark 3.9. (a) The above result is of course stable under Lipschitz continuous perturbations
of the right-hand side.
Indeed, let B be an invariant evolutionary mapping, leaving the space
of predictable processes invariant, with B being causal and with the property that the eventual
0 σ(u)dW (s) is strictly less than c > 0, then the assertion of

Lipschitz constant of u 7→ B(u) +R (·)

Theorem 3.8 remains the same, if one considers the equation

(∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f +Z (·)

0

σ(u)dW (s) + B(u)

(3.6)

instead of (3.5).

(b) (Initial value problems) Similarly to the deterministic case treated in Lemma 2.10, we can
Indeed the

also formulate initial value problems for the special case M (∂−1

on (0,∞)
in H−1(A + 1)

with given adapted H-valued process f vanishing on (−∞, 0] can be rephrased identifying M0u0 =
M0u0χΩ ∈ H ⊗ L2(P). With this notation, the initial value problem above can be reformulated as

(∂0,ν M0 + M1 + A)v = f +Z ·

0

σ(v + χ[0,∞)u0)dW (s) − χ[0,∞)M1u0 − χ[0,∞)Au0

as our appropriate realization of the initial value problem. Note that the map

v 7→Z ·

0

σ(v + χ[0,∞)u0)dW (s)

is still invariant evolutionary. Thus, solving for v ∈ Hν,0(R; H ⊗ L2(P)) gives, follow the lines of
Lemma 2.10, that M0v(0−) = 0 = M0v(0+) ∈ H−1(A + 1) ⊗ L2(P), which eventually leads to the
attainment of the initial value M0u(0+) = M0u0 in H−1(A + 1) ⊗ L2(P).
Example 3.10. As a particular example for Remark 3.9(a), any deterministic Lipschitz continuous
mapping from H with values in H, is an eligible right-hand side in (3.6). These mappings have
been used in [6, Chapter 7].

3.3 SPDEs with additive noise

In this section we investigate the solution theory of equations with additive noise, that is, the
stochastic integral on the right-hand side in (1.1) is replaced by a stochastic process X: Let, in
this section, X be any H-valued stochastic process, more speciﬁcally, the map (t, ω) 7→ X(t, ω)
belongs to Hν,0(R; H ⊗ L2(P)). This includes in particular stochastic processes on Hilbert spaces
that have continuous or c`adl`ag paths, and in particular L´evy processes and fractional Brownian
motions. Hence, the equation to be solved is given by

(∂0,νM (∂−1

0,ν) + A)u = f + X

Then we can apply Theorem 2.8 to these equations and we will obtain a unique solution – for
any stochastic process X whose paths are in Hν,0(R; H ⊗ L2(P)), which is only a condition on the
integrability of its paths.

17

Now we we are going to show a more general result. With the notation as in Theorem 2.8, we

consider the equation

(∂0,ν M (∂−1

0,νX,

0,ν) + A)u = f + ∂k

(3.7)
where the right-hand side is an element of Hν,−k(R; H ⊗ L2(P)), for all k ∈ N0. Then, the noise
term is interpreted as the k-times distributional time derivative of the paths of the stochastic
process X. The space Hν,−k(R; H ⊗ L2(P)) is the distribution space belonging to ∂0,ν realized as
an operator in Hν,0(R; H ⊗ L2(P)). The solution theory for such a class of equations is then a
corollary to the general solution theory in Theorem 2.8.

Theorem 3.11. Assume that M and A satisfy the conditions in Theorem 2.8. Suppose that X
is a H-valued stochastic process whose paths belong to Hν,0(R; H ⊗ L2(P)). Then there exists a
unique solution u to (3.7) in Hν,−k(R; H ⊗ L2(P)).
Proof. The assertion follows once observed that (∂0M (∂−1
0 )+ A)−1 can be realized as a continuous
linear operator in Hν,−k(R; H ⊗ L2(P)) with Lipschitz constant bounded above by 1/c (see also
Remark 2.9).

We note the main achievement of this section. The right-hand side has to be in Hν,−k(R; H ⊗
L2(P)), only. Note that there are no stochastic integrals involved, neither did we make any
assumption on the regularity of the noise term ∂k
0,νX, other than that it is the k-th time-derivative
of a stochastic process X. Therefore we have found a way to make sense of stochastic diﬀerential
equations in Hilbert spaces where the random noise can be a very irregular object, given by the
distributional derivative of any stochastic process (L´evy, Markov etc.) with only the assumption
of integrability of its paths. The solution to these equations is an element of the space of stochastic
distributions (in the time argument).

4 Examples

In this section, we shall give some examples for the solution theory presented above. We emphasize,
that – at least in principle – the only thing to be taken care of is the formulation of the respective
problem in an appropriate way as an operator equation in appropriate Hilbert spaces. The way how
we do it is that we start with the equation given formally as a stochastic diﬀerential equation and,
after some algebraic manipulations, we shall give the appropriate replacement to be solved with
the solution theory based on Theorem 3.8 or Theorem 3.11. In the whole section, we let W be a G-
valued Wiener process for some separable Hilbert space G and we assume that σ : H0 → L2(G, H0)
is Lipschitz continuous, where H0 will be clear from the context. For simplicity of the exposition,
we assume that we only have a stochastic term containing σ on the right-hand side and null
initial conditions. The way how to incorporate a path-wise perturbation and/or non-zero initial
conditions was shown in Remark 3.9.

In Section 5, we justify our ﬁndings for the heat and the wave equation and put them into

perspective of more classical solution concepts.

4.1 Stochastic heat equation
We consider the following SPDE in an open set D ⊆ Rd

∂0u(t) − ∆u(t) = σ(u(t))dW,
u(0) = 0, u|∂D = 0,

(4.1)

where ∆ is the Laplace operator acting on the deterministic spatial variables x ∈ D only. This
equation has been studied in [30], see also [6, Example 7.6] for a treatment in Hilbert spaces. We
establish the boundary condition in the way that u ∈ H 1
0 (D), the Sobolev space of the once weakly
diﬀerentiable functions, which may be approximated in the H 1(D)-norm by smooth functions with
compact support contained in D. Before we formulate the heat equation in our operator-theoretic
setting, we need to introduce some diﬀerential operators.

18

Deﬁnition 4.1. We deﬁne

gradc : C∞

c (D) ⊆ L2(D) → L2(D)d

grad: H 1(D) ⊆ L2(D) → L2(D)d

φ 7→ (∂j φ)j∈{1,...,d},

φ 7→ (∂j φ)j∈{1,...,d}

and let div := − grad∗

c , ˚div := − grad∗ as well as ˚grad := gradc.

Throughout this section, we will use these operators to reformulate the SPDEs in an adequate
way. The meaning of these operators is that the ones with the superscript “˚” carry the homo-
geneous boundary conditions on ∂D: ˚div carries zero Neumann boundary conditions and ˚grad
carries zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. With these operators we can rewrite the Laplacian
with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions as ∆ = div ˚grad.

We may now come back to the stochastic heat equation. We perform an algebraic manipulation
to equation

to reformulate it as a system of ﬁrst order SPDEs. First, we apply the operator ∂−1

as

Remark 2.7. In order to prove the validity of condition (3.4), we let (φ, ψ) ∈ L2(D) ⊕ L2(D)d and

Corollary 4.2. With the notations from the beginning of this section, assume that σ : L2(D) →

for all u, v ∈ H and some L > 0.

Then there exists ν1 > 0 such that for all ν > ν1, the equation

has a unique solution (u, q) ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗1L2(D)d+1), which is independent of ν. (For a deﬁnition
of PW one might recall Remark 3.3)

The solution theory is not limited to the case of partial diﬀerential operators with constant
coeﬃcients. The following remark shows how to invoke partial diﬀerential operators with variable
coeﬃcients.

Remark 4.3. Starting out with a deterministic bounded measurable matrix-valued coeﬃcient func-
tion a : D → Cd×d being pointwise self-adjoint and uniformly strictly positive, that is, ha(x)ξ, ξi >
chξ, ξi for all x ∈ D, ξ ∈ Rd and some c > 0, we consider the stochastic heat equation

∂0u − diva ˚gradu = σ(u)dW,

with the same vanishing boundary and initial data as above. Substituting a−1q = − ˚grad∂−1
arrive at the system

deﬁniteness.)

4.2 Stochastic wave equation

Similarly to the treatment of the stochastic heat equation in the previous section, we show now
how to reformulate the stochastic wave equation into a ﬁrst order system and then prove the
existence and uniqueness of solution. This equation has been treated in [30, 5] with a random-
ﬁeld approach and for instance in [6, Example 5.8, Section 13.21] with a semi-group approach.
Consider the following equation

∂2
0 u − ∆u = σ(u)dW,

u(0) = 0, ∂0u(0) = 0, u|∂D = 0.

(4.5)

As in the previous section, we ﬁrst apply the operator ∂−1
deﬁne v := ˚grad∂−1

0 u. With these manipulations, we arrive at the following ﬁrst-order system

to (4.5), write ∆ = div ˚grad, and ﬁnally

v(cid:19) =(cid:18)R ·

0 σ(u)dW

0

(cid:19) ,

(4.6)

which we think of as the appropriate formulation for the stochastic wave equation. Now we can
show, with σ : L2(D) → L2(G, L2(D)) Lipschitz continuous, the existence and uniqueness of a
solution to (4.6) with the help of Theorem 3.8. The only thing to be veriﬁed is that

M (z) :=(cid:18)1 0
0 1(cid:19)

20

satisﬁes condition (3.4) for all z ∈ B(r, r), for some r > 0. This, however, is easy (see also the
computation in (4.4)). Thus, we just obtained the following:

Corollary 4.4. There is ν0 > 0 such that for all ν > ν0, there is a unique (u, v) ∈ Hν,0(R; PW ⊗
1L2(D)d+1) such that

(cid:18)∂0(cid:18)1 0

v(cid:19) =(cid:18)R ·

0 σ(u)dW

0

(cid:19) .

The solution is independent of ν.

We emphasize that the way of writing the stochastic wave equation into a ﬁrst-order-in-time
0 u. With this we arrive at

system is not unique. Indeed, a more familiar way is to set w := −∆∂−1
the following system

(cid:19) .

(4.7)

The latter system is essentially the same as the system in (4.6), see [19, p. 16/17] for the mathemat-
ically rigorous statement. However, the spatial Hilbert spaces diﬀer from one another: in (4.6) the
0 (D) ⊕ L2(D).
spatial Hilbert space is H = L2(D) ⊕ L2(D)d, and in (4.7) it coincides with H = H 1

0 (D) ⊕ dom(div) and dom(∆) ⊕ H 1
0 (D), respectively, where
dom(∆) = dom(div ˚grad). However, the solvability of one system implies the solvability of the
0 (D) with the scalar product induced by
other one.
(u, v) 7→ hgrad u, grad vi, it can be shown that
0 (D) ⊆ H 1

is skew-self-adjoint. For the latter assertion, it is suﬃcient to note the following proposition:
Lemma 4.5. Assume that D ⊆ Rd is bounded. Let C : dom(div ˚grad) ⊆ H 1
Cu = ∆u. Then, for C∗ : dom(C∗) ⊆ L2(D) → H 1

0 (D) → L2(D) with

0 (D) we have
C∗v = −v for all v ∈ dom(C∗) = H 1

0 (D),

0 (D) is endowed with the scalar product (u, v) 7→ hgrad u, grad vi.

where H 1
Proof. Let v ∈ L2(D) and f ∈ H 1

0 (D). Then we compute

v ∈ dom(C∗), C∗v = f ⇐⇒ ∀φ ∈ dom(C) : hCφ, viL2(D) = hφ, fiH1

0 (D)

⇐⇒ ∀φ ∈ dom(div ˚grad) : hdiv ˚gradφ, viL2(D) = h ˚gradφ, ˚gradfiL2(D)
⇐⇒ ∀φ ∈ dom(div ˚grad) : hdiv ˚gradφ, viL2(D) = −hdiv ˚gradφ, fiL2(D)
⇐⇒ ∀φ ∈ dom(div ˚grad) : hdiv ˚gradφ, v + fiL2(D) = 0.

But, div ˚grad: dom(div ˚grad) ⊆ L2(D) → L2(D) is continuously invertible. In particular, div ˚grad
is onto. Hence,

∀φ ∈ dom(div ˚grad) : hdiv ˚gradφ, v + fiL2(D) = 0 ⇐⇒ v = −f ∈ H 1

0 (D).

The assertion follows.

21

Hence, with Lemma 4.5 in mind, in either formulation – (4.6) or (4.7) – our solution theory,
Theorem 3.8, applies. We will comment in section 5 on the relationship of the solution obtained
for (4.7) to a more classical way of deriving the solution by means of C0-semi-groups. We shall
also note that the functional analytic framework provided serves to treat deterministic variable
coeﬃcients a : D → Cd×d satisfying the same assumptions as in 4.3 and to treat the corresponding

4.3 Stochastic Schr¨odinger equation with additive noise
In this section we treat the stochastic Schr¨odinger equation on a domain D ⊆ Rd, see for instance
[3, Chapter 2]. It can be formulated as

∂0u − i∆u = b(u) + ∂0X,

u(0) = 0,

with appropriate boundary conditions such that ∆ becomes a self-adjoint operator (recall that
them i∆ is skew-selfadjoint) and

b : Hν,−1(R; L2(D) ⊗ L2(P)) → Hν,−1(R; L2(D) ⊗ L2(P))

being Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant less than ν. We assume that ∂0X is the
derivative of a stochastic process as discussed in Section 3.3. Then the stochastic Schr¨odinger
equation is well-posed according to Theorem 3.11.

4.4 Stochastic Maxwell Equations

Before discussing the stochastic Maxwell equations, we need to introduce some vector-analytic
operators. In the whole section let D ⊆ R3 be a domain.
Deﬁnition 4.6. We deﬁne

curlc : C∞

where ∂1, ∂2, ∂3 are the partial derivatives with respect to the ﬁrst, second and third spatial
variable, respectively. Let curl := curl∗

c and ˚curl := curl∗.

We introduce the linear operators ǫ, µ, ζ ∈ L(L2(D)3), modeling the respective material coeﬃ-
cients dielectricity, magnetic permeability and electric conductivity, with the following additional
properties

• ǫ is self-adjoint and positive deﬁnite, ǫ∗ = ǫ > 0,
• µ is self-adjoint, µ∗ = µ,
• both the operators µ and νǫ +ℜζ are strictly positive deﬁnite if ν > 0 is chosen large enough.
Then Maxwell’s equations can be written in the form

0 µ(cid:19) +(cid:18)ζ

This ﬁrst-order system is well-posed in solving for (E, H) ∈ Hν,0(R; L2(D)6), where the quantity
J ∈ Hν,0(R; L2(D)3), the external currents, is a given right-hand side. Indeed, this follows from
our deterministic solution theory in Theorem 2.8, see [18, Section 3.1.12.4] for a detailed treatment.
Hence, incorporating stochastic integrals in the Maxwell equations leads to

which in turn is well-posed by Theorem 3.8.

Remark 4.7. Note that the Maxwell equations with multiplicative noise have not been – to the
best of our knowledge – discussed yet in the literature. The above formulation of this particular
reformulation is in fact a possible way to understand the ‘stochastic Maxwell equations with
multiplicative noise’. Stochastic Maxwell equations with additive noise, have, however, been
discussed in the literature. A solution theory for this line of problem can again be found in
Section 3.3.

4.5 SPDEs with fractional time derivatives

Due to the generality of our ansatz with respect to the freedom in the operator coeﬃcient M (∂−1
0 ),
we may also treat stochastic partial diﬀerential equations with fractional time derivatives. As an
instant, let us consider the following super-diﬀusion equation for α ∈ (0, 1):

∂1+α
0

u − ∆u = σ(u)dW,

subject to zero initial and, for instance, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in an open set
D ⊆ Rd. Note that we can incorporate these homogeneous boundary conditions in the formulation
of the abstract setting (without regards to the smoothness of the boundary of D) in the way that
∆ := ˚div grad, where ˚div carries the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. As in the
previous sections, we deﬁne an auxiliary unknown v := − grad ∂−1
0 u and get the following system
v(cid:19) =(cid:18)R (·)

v(cid:19) +(cid:18) 0

∂0(cid:19)(cid:18)u

0 σ(u)dW

(cid:18)∂α

(cid:19)

as the appropriate formulation for the stochastic super-diﬀusion equation discussed above. Recall
that the part with the time derivative is given by ∂0M (∂−1

0 ), where here M is given by

M (z) :=(cid:18)zα−1

0

0

1(cid:19) .

It can be shown that this M satisﬁes the condition of strict positive deﬁniteness for all z ∈ B(r, r)
for all r > 0 in (3.4), see [22, Lemma 2.1 or Theorem 3.5]. Hence, Theorem 3.8 is applicable and
well-posedness is established.

Remark 4.8. Of course one can think of more complicated equations containing fractional (time)
derivatives. For other possible equations containing fractional (time) derivatives, we refer to
[32, 22] and the references therein. In order to limit the extend of this exposition, we postpone a
more detailed survey of fractional stochastic partial diﬀerential equation to future work.

5 Relationship to other solution concepts

In the following we describe the relationship to other solution approaches for SPDEs. For con-
venience, we will focus on the stochastic heat and wave equation with constant coeﬃcients. We
consider the semi-group approach in [6] and the variational approach in the sense of [27], see also
[24, 25].

23

Before we come to the relationship to other solution concepts, we emphasize that – even in
the deterministic setting – the solution concept developed is diﬀerent to the semi-group approach.
On the one hand, even though the solution theory in Theorem 2.8 may be extended to closed
densely deﬁned operators A satisfying ℜhAφ, φi,ℜhA∗ψ, ψi > 0 for all φ ∈ dom(A), ψ ∈ dom(A∗),
the solution theory given by Theorem 2.8 does not extend to all equations which are covered by
semi-group-methods as the latter may be carried over to the Banach space case. Thus, there
are equations that may be solved via the semi-group method, that cannot be solved with the
approach presented here. On the other hand, there are also equations that are not covered by
semi-groups, which nonetheless fall into the class of evolutionary equations. For this we mention
certain diﬀerential-algebraic systems or equations of mixed type, see [34] or [21, 20, 33, 23] for
particular examples.

In any case, many equations from mathematical physics may be successfully studied within
the present solution theory whilst imposing rather mild (if any) conditions on the regularity of
the coeﬃcient or the boundary of the underlying spatial domain. Moreover, the current approach
may open the doors for solution concepts for SPDEs, which are of mixed type or consist of rather
complicated constitutive relations. We refer to the conclusion of this manuscript for a short
account on that.

We note a general observation: Although the solutions constructed in this exposition live on the
whole real time line, the support of the solutions is concentrated on the positive real axis provided
the one of the right-hand side is.
Indeed, this is a consequence of causality of the respective
solution operators.

5.1 Connection to variational solutions
We consider the stochastic heat equation on an open subset D ⊆ Rd

∂0u(t) − ∆u(t) = σ(u(t))dW (t),

u(0) = 0, (∂0u)(0) = 0, u|∂D = 0,

and our reformulation as a ﬁrst-order system from Section 4.1

We will suppose that σ is Lipschitz continuous. Then by Theorem 3.8, this system has a unique
(predictable) solution in Hν,0(R; L2(D)d+1). We will compare our solution to the one deﬁned in [27,
Deﬁnition 2.1] (with g = 0 and φ = 0). We understand the following notion as a variational/weak
solution to the heat equation (5.1):

In the next few lines, we will show that any variational solution in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.1
is a solution of (5.2). In order to avoid unnecessarily cluttered notation, we shall occasionally
neglect referring to the real numbers in the notation of the vector-valued spaces to be studied in
the following. For instance, for Hν,0(R; H 1

For the reverse direction, we need an additional regularity assumption. Before commenting
on this, we shall derive an equality, which is almost the one in (5.3). We need the following
prerequisite of abstract nature.

Proof. By causality and the fact that W = 0 for negative times, we infer (u, q) is supported on

Furthermore, we have

For this, we need some elementary prerequisites:

theorem for the (strictly positive deﬁnite) Dirichlet–Laplace operator ∆ on the underlying open
and bounded domain D. Hence, (b) is a consequence of (a) by Fubini’s theorem.

Next, we proceed to a proof of the main result in this section.

6 Conclusion

We presented an attempt for a uniﬁed solution theory for a class of stochastic partial diﬀerential
equations. The concept is an adaption of the deterministic solution theory developed in [17] and,
thus, it applies to various physical phenomena. More precisely, we perturbed the deterministic

28

equation by a stochastic right-hand side. This right-hand side turned out to be Lipschitz continu-
ous since the solution operator of the deterministic PDE leaves – thanks to causality – predictable
processes invariant.

For particular cases, we demonstrated that the solutions derived coincide with ‘variational
solutions’ or ‘mild solutions’. The main application of the present results maybe to derive a
solution concept for (S)PDEs when the semi-group approach fails and the existence of a semi-group
(suﬃciently regular fundamental solution) cannot be shown. In particular, if one is confronted
with equations of mixed type, see, for instance, [34], [23, p 765], the present approach may be
advanced. Further applications can be found in diﬀerential-algebraic system as in control theory,
see [21, 20].
