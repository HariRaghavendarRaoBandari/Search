A Simple and Eﬀective Inequality Measure

Luke A. Prendergast and Robert G. Staudte

10 March, 2016

Abstract

Ratios of quantiles are often computed for income distributions as rough measures of
inequality, and inference for such ratios have recently become available. The special case
when the quantiles are symmetrically chosen; that is, when the p/2 quantile is divided by
the (1−p/2), is of special interest because the graph of such ratios, plotted as a function of
p over the unit interval, yields an informative inequality curve. The area above the curve
and less than the horizontal line at one is an easily interpretable coeﬃcient of inequality.
The advantages of these concepts over the traditional Lorenz curve and Gini coeﬃcient
are numerous: they are deﬁned for all positive income distributions, they can be robustly
estimated and distribution-free conﬁdence intervals for the inequality coeﬃcient are easily
found. Moreover the inequality curves satisfy a median-based transference principle and
are convex for many commonly assumed income distributions..

Introduction

1.1 Background

The widespread plotting of Lorenz curves and reporting of the associated Gini coeﬃcients
for income data since their introduction (Lorenz, 1905; Gini, 1914) over a century ago
guarantees their historical importance. These original works also stimulated hundreds of
theoretical papers. However, despite substantial progress in inferential methodology, (see
Beach & Davidson, 1983; Cowell & Victoria-Feser, 2003; Davidson, 2008, and references
therein), there are inherent defects in the original concepts which preclude distribution-free
methods. The ﬁrst is the explicit requirement that the population mean exists (together
with the implicit requirement that its variance exists in order to carry out inference).
The second defect in these traditional concepts down-weight smaller incomes, thus giving
too much emphasis to the middle incomes. The ﬁrst defect can be overcome by utilizing
quantile versions of the Lorenz curve which have recently been studied by Prendergast
& Staudte (2015a), and both defects can be overcome by employing the simple ratios of
symmetric quantiles, which we now investigate. There are other desiderata that many
economists might require of a measure of inequality, such as mean-income tranference
principles, Cowell & Victoria-Feser (2002), and decomposability, Bourguignon (1979). The
ﬁrst property is not satisﬁed by the quantile measures, but they do preserve a parallel
transference principle that is median preserving. Finally, it is important that inequality
measures and their estimates be applicable to a wide range of income distributions. Recent

emphasis has been on combinations of lognormal for the lower portion of incomes, with
Pareto tails for the upper; for recent examples and discussion see Clementia & Gallegati
(2005), Ghosh et al. (2011) and Bee (2014). Another advantage of the inequality measure
described herein is that it requires no parametric model assumptions.

1.2 Deﬁnitions and basic properties
Let F satisfy F (0−) = 0 and the pth quantile xp = Q(p) = F −1(p) = inf{x : F (x) ≥ p},
0 < p < 1. Deﬁne the symmetric ratio of quantiles for 0 < p < 1 by R(p) = xp/2/x1−p/2.
Clearly for each p, R(p) gives the ratio of the typical (median) income of the lowest
proportion p of incomes to the typical (median) income of the largest proportion p. Extend
R to [0,1] by deﬁning R(0) = 0 and R(1) = 1. The graph {(p, R(p)} of R has the following
properties, as the reader can readily verify:

1. 0 ≤ R(p) ≤ 1
2. R(p) is monotone increasing from R(0) = 0 to R(1) = 1.

3. R(p) = 1 for all 0 < p < 1 if and only if all incomes are equal.

4. R(p) is scale invariant.

5. After any median preserving transformation of funds from the upper half of incomes

Deﬁne the ratio coeﬃcient of inequality by I = I(F ) = 1 −(cid:82) 1

to the lower half of incomes, R(p) can only increase.

0 R(p)dp. Then 0 ≤ I ≤ 1
with I(F ) = 0 when all incomes are equal. Letting m = x0.5 and making the change of
(cid:20) X
variable x = F −1(p/2) one obtains the following result:

where X ∼ F (·|X ≤ m) and F (X) + F (Y ) = 1 deﬁnes Y . If one selects an income at
random from those below the median and divides it by its symmetric quantile, on average
one obtains 1− I(F ). Therefore, I(F ) has the simple interpretation as the average relative
distance (Y − X)/Y of X from its symmetric quantile Y .

The useful properties for I lead us to explore the measure as an alternative to the Gini

Index which is deﬁned as

G = 1 − 1

Like I, G ∈ [0, 1] where G = 1 equates to maximum inequality and G = 0 for the situation
of equal incomes for all.

1.3 Summary of results

We begin in Section 2 with examples of inequality curves and coeﬃcients of inequality
for some common income distributions and compare values of I with G. Then in Sec-
tion 3 we introduce empirical versions of these concepts and investigate their inferential
properties, including robustness to outliers. In particular large sample distribution-free
conﬁdence intervals are obtained and their properties compared with those for the Gini
Index. Applications to income data are in Section 4. A summary and discussion of further
possible work is contained in Section 5. Although convexity of the inequality curves is not
considered by us to be a requisite for measuring inequality, it is an inherent property of
Lorenz curves, and possessed for the ratios of symmetric quantiles for many distributions,
so conditions for convexity are given in Appendix B.

Beta(a, a) models with parameters a = 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2, respectively, in solid, dashed, dotted and dash-dotted
lines. The top right graphs arise from Chi-squared(ν) models with ν = 1/4, 1, 4 and 25, respectively, in solid,
dashed, dotted and dash-dotted lines. The bottom left is for Type II Pareto(a) with a = 1/2, 1, 2 and 100,
respectively; and the bottom right for Weibull(β), with parameters β = 1/2, 1, 2 and 10.

2 Examples
In this section we consider examples of the inequality curves {(p, R(p)} and the associated
quantile inequality index I for several well-known distributions before making some com-
parisons between I and the Gini Index G. For background material on all the standard
probability models in this paper, see Johnson et al. (1994, 1995).

2.1 Examples of the graphs of R(p)
In Figure 1 are shown the graphs {(p, R(p)} of ratios of symmetric quantiles for some
common probability models. The area between each graph and the horizontal line at 1 is
equal to I(F ), as described in (1).
For the symmetric Beta(a, a) family the densities are U-shaped for small a with limiting
case as a → 0 of half the mass moving to each of the two points 0 and 1; and for large a
the densities are unimodal with the limiting case as a → ∞ having all the incomes at one
point 1/2. Therefore the values of Ia decrease from 1 to 0 as a increases from 0 to +∞.
Note that Beta(1,1) is the uniform distribution on [0,1].
The Chi-squared(ν) densities become increasingly skewed as ν → 0, and Iν decreases
from 1 to 0 as ν increases from 0 to +∞. Similarly, for the Weibull(β) family, Iβ decreases
from 1 to 0 as β increases from 0 to +∞ The Weibull(1) is the exponential distribution,
which has R(p) = ln(2 − p)/ ln(p).
For the Type II Pareto(a) family, the graph of Ra approaches that of the exponential
as a → +∞. Further, the range of Ia is much more restricted than for the other families
shown above, decreasing from 1 to 0.702 as a increases from 0 to +∞. This family of
income distributions only represents relatively high inequality.
The quantile function of the lognormal model is given by Q(p) = ezp where zp = Φ−1(p)
is the quantile function of the standard normal. Hence R(p) = exp{zp/2 − z1−p/2} =

Moreover, although the graph appears to be convex, it is not convex for p < 0.045, as
the reader can readily verify. The convexity of R cannot always be easily determined by
inspection of a plot, so a more formal approach to convexity is taken in Appendix B.

in Table 1. The numbers labeling the points identify the distributions listed in the table.

2.2 Comparing values of I with G

In Figure 2 we plot examples of I versus G for the distributions listed in Table 1.
‘Lognormal-Frechet’ refers to a composite lognormal, Frechet distribution, which is pop-
ular in income modeling, see Nadarajah & Bakar (2013) for example. The value for G for
the Pareto(1) distribution is marked with an asterisk since it is undeﬁned (since the mean
of the Pareto Type II is only deﬁned for shape parameters greater than one). However,
it was computed numerically and we leave it for the purpose of comparisons later. There
are clear diﬀerences between G and I, but they are positively correlated, and can be in-
terpreted similarly in terms of rankings. A notable point of diﬀerence occurs for Model 2,
the highly U-shaped Beta(0.1,0.1) distribution, where G ≈ 0.49 while I ≈ 0.91; this is a
situation where the income population is essentially composed of two equal size groups,
having quite diﬀerent values, and we think that I better captures this disparity.

A distinct advantage of I over G is that its values are more spread out, allowing for

easier comparisons based on sample estimates, which we now demonstrate.

Inference

3
In this Section we restrict attention to F ∈ F(cid:48), where

F(cid:48) = {F ∈ F : f = F (cid:48) exists and is strictly positive.}

For such F we can deﬁne the quantile density q(p) = Q(cid:48)(p) = 1/f (xp) of Parzen (1979),
which is also the sparsity index of Tukey (1965).

3.1 Approximating I(F )

j = 1, 2, . . . , J. Then evaluate the ratio R(pj) for pj in the grid and ﬁnd I (J) ≡ J−1 (cid:80)

We next deﬁne a simple method for approximating I that will prove useful in the inference
Section 3.2. Given an integer J, deﬁne a grid {pj} on (0,1) by pj = (j − 1/2)/J, for
j{1−
R(pj)}. One can make I (J) as close to I as desired by choosing J suﬃciently large.

Table 1 lists values of the Gini Index G, the quantile inequality index I and the
approximations to I denoted I (J) for several choices of J. As can be seen, I (J) converges
quickly with no diﬀerences to three decimal places reported between I (100) and I (500).
Another example where an exact result can be obtained is the Type II Pareto dis-
tribution with shape parameter a = 1 so that Q(p) = 1/(1 − p) − 1. We then have
0 R(p)dp = 4 ln(2) − 2 = 0.7726 which again agrees, to four decimal places, with the

1 −(cid:82) 1

results for I (J) reported in Table 1.

3.2 Estimation

Given a sample X1, . . . , Xn from F with order statistics X(1), . . . , X(n) and empirical cdf
Fn one can estimate Q(p) by Qn(p) = F −1
n (p) = X([np]+1), but this is discontinuous in p, so
we utilise instead the Hyndman & Fan (1996) estimator ˆxp, which is a linear combination
of two adjacent order statistics, This estimator is Type 8 of quantile estimators on the
software package R, Development Core Team (2008).

5

For each 0 < p < 1 deﬁne ˆR(p) = ˆxp/2/ˆx1−p/2. The asymptotic normality of arbitrary
ratios of sample quantiles ˆxp/ˆxq is derived in Prendergast & Staudte (2015b), so we only
n{ ˆR(p) − R(p)} converges in distribution to a normal
state that it can be shown that

a2 = (p/2) (1 − p/2) q2(1 − p/2)/x2
1−p/2. This formula enables one to ﬁnd large-sample
√
100(1 − α)% conﬁdence intervals for R(p) of the form ˆR(p) ± z1−α/2ˆσp/
n, where ˆσp
requires estimates of the quantile density q at p/2 and 1−p/2; speciﬁc estimates are derived
in Prendergast & Staudte (2016) and utilized in Prendergast & Staudte (2015b). Here we

want conﬁdence intervals for I = 1 −(cid:82) R(p) dp, which we estimate by ˆI = 1 −(cid:82) ˆR(p) dp.

Closed form expressions for I and ˆI are not usually available, so we obtained numerical
approximations to them as follows.
As in Section 3.1 where we approximated I by I (J), we estimate I (J), and hence I,
as follows. Let pj = (j − 1/2)/J, for j = 1, 2, . . . , J. and for each j let ˆRi(pj) be the

estimated ordinate of the ratio inequality curve at pj. Then (cid:98)I (J) is deﬁned by

{1 − ˆR(pj) .

Beach & Davidson (1983) ﬁnd the limiting joint normal distribution of estimates of a
ﬁnite number of Lorenz curve ordinates, based on a ﬁnite number of sample quantiles,
assuming F ∈ F(cid:48) has a ﬁnite mean. In the same way, for F ∈ F(cid:48), the limiting joint normal
distribution of the estimated ordinates ˆR(pj), j = 1, . . . , J can be established. An analytic
expression for the covariance matrix is not required by us, only asymptotic normality of

ˆI, which being an average of the ˆR(pj)s, is immediate. An approximate variance of (cid:98)I (J),
Var[(cid:98)I (J)], is given in (9) in the Appendix, and an asymptotic (1 − α) × 100 conﬁdence

3.3 Interval coverage and width

In this section we assess the coverage probability and expected interval width for the
interval estimators of I given in (5). We also provide some comparisons with estimators of

G where the (1−α/2)×100% conﬁdence interval for G is computed as (cid:98)G±z1−α/2
and where Var((cid:98)G) is given in Davidson (2008).

In Table 2 are listed simulated coverage probabilities and average widths for the inter-
vals (5) for several choices of sample sizes and the same wide range of distributions. Of
particular merit is the fact that the coverage probability is, in most cases, slightly above
the nominal 0.95. When it is below 0.95, the coverage is still at least very good with
the smallest coverage found to be 0.93 for the Beta(0.5,0.5) distribution when n = 100.
Overall, the simulations suggest reliable coverage, even for n = 100, and narrow expected

interval widths relative to I. The distributions diﬀer enough to suggest that the interval
estimator will be reliable in practice. Similar results were found for other choices of J.

In Table 3 we repeat the simulations from Table 2 but this time for interval estimation
of G. The extremely poor coverages for the Pareto(1) are expected since, as noted previ-
ously, G is not deﬁned. While most of the coverages are reasonably close to the nominal
level of 0.95, unlike the interval estimators for I they are not consistently so.

In Table 9 of the Appendix C we make comparisons of the estimators of G and I by
computing their empirical biases and standard errors. Again, the large bias reported for
estimation of G in the case of the Pareto(1) distribution are not surprising since G is not
deﬁned (and comparisons with a numerically computed, but incorrect, G are made). The
diﬀerence in performance of the estimators ˆI and ˆG are more dramatically revealed in the
next Section.

3.4 Robustness properties

Cowell & Victoria-Feser (1996) show that the Lorenz curve ordinates and Gini index have
unbounded inﬂuence functions, but the ratio of quantiles is well known to have a bounded
inﬂuence, see Prendergast & Staudte (2015b), for example. This implies that the inﬂuence
function of the quantile inequality index I is also bounded, because it is an average of
bounded inﬂuence functions.

In this section we provide simulations that show that I is robust and provides a better
alternative to the Gini index G when outliers are present. In Figure 3 we provide boxplots
of 1000 simulated estimates of I and G from n observations randomly generated from a
composite lognormal-Frechet distribution Nadarajah & Bakar (2013).

Figure 3: Boxplots of 1000 centered (with respect to the true I = 0.5431 and G = 0.5338) simulated estimates
of I and G from n observations randomly generated from the composite lognormal-Frechet distribution with
parameters exp(−1.72), exp(0.12), exp(−0.29) and exp(0.41) (Plot A). In Plot B the simulation is repeated but
where one observation is replaced with the 0.999 quantile as an outlier.

Plot A includes estimates resulting from a straight random sampling from the distri-
butions while in Plot B we replace one observation in the sampling with a large outlier
(the 0.999 quantile). Even in Plot A where no artiﬁcial outlier was included, it can be
seen the estimates of G are biased. Additionally, the variance in estimation of G is large
especially when compared to the much lower variability shown for the estimates of I.
Another beneﬁt of I is in the fact that the bias of the estimates is negligible. Overall
properties of the estimator of I in this setting (small bias and small variability) suggest
that it is an attractive choice as a measure of inequality.

Denmark (Plot A). In Plot B the simulation is repeated but where one observation is replaced with the maximum
value from the complete data set.

We now repeat the simulation but sample from a data set that consists of 2492 Danish
ﬁre insurance claims; it is available from the R package SMPracticals (Davison, 2013) and
is considered on Page 278 of Davison (2013). Plot A depicts boxplots of 1000 simulated
estimates for n observations randomly selected from the complete data set. The estimates

are (cid:98)G = 0.5150 and (cid:98)I = 0.5337. While the variability of ˆG has decreased for smaller n the
bias is large when n ≤ 200. Bias is not a problem for (cid:98)G when n = 500, but the variance

is far greater than it is for the estimation of I. Once again we see that the estimates of I
are excellent when compared to those for G, with smaller variability and bias. In Plot B
we repeat the simulation, but now include in each sample the largest value in the original
data set. The estimator of I is hardly aﬀected by the outlier. However, the estimator of
G is heavily biased which is notable even when n = 500.

We next consider four applications to illustrate the versatility and eﬀectiveness of I.

4.1 Example 1: Danish insurance data

We ﬁrst estimate G and I for the Danish insurance data introduced in the last section.

The estimate of I is (cid:98)I = 0.5337 which has small standard error of approximately 0.007
and subsequent 95% conﬁdence interval (0.5204, 0.5470). In contrast, while (cid:98)G = 0.5150

is similar in magnitude, the standard error is much larger at 0.0230 resulting in much less
certainty in the 95% conﬁdence interval estimator (0.4699, 0.5601).

4.2 Example 2: Earnings data

In this example hourly earnings data from 1992 (2962 paired (male-female) observa-
tions) and 1998 (2603 paired observations). The data can be found as ﬁle aCPSch3.csv
at https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html and has been
considered by Stock & Watson (2003).

Figure 5: Plots of the Lorenz curve and the quantile inequality curve for the earnings data for males and
females in the years 1992 and 1998.

Figure 5 depicts the Lorenz and quantile inequality curves for males and females in
1992 and 1998. As can be seen, the Lorenz curves for each set of the data are very similar
suggesting little diﬀerence in inequality. The quantile inequality curve on the other hand
tells a diﬀerent story. There is a diﬀerence between the curves for males and females in
1992 and in 1998 with stronger evidence for the former. This suggest greater inequality
among males when compared to females.

In Table 4 we provide estimates of G and I for the earnings data for males (M) and
females (F) in 1992 and 1998 including diﬀerences between years (labeled 1998-1992) and
between gender (labeled M-F). As a matter of comparison we give the Wald-type intervals
such as those in (5) and (6) as well as bootstrap intervals with 500 replicates. The
bootstrap intervals are taken to be the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the 500 bootstrapped
estimates of G and I. As can be seen the Wald-type and bootstrap intervals are almost
identical. The interval estimates for the diﬀerence between males and females in 1992
based on G and I both indicate a diﬀerence in 1992. With respect to G, this was diﬃcult
to ascertain from the Lorenz curve alone. The evidence is more compelling according
to I. In 1998, there was no diﬀerence between males and females according to G with
an estimated diﬀerence close to zero. However, a diﬀerence is found for I and although

reasonably small, the interval estimate agrees with our notion that the quantile curves
were diﬀerent between the genders.

4.3 ABS weekly income data

Table 5 shows estimates of the gross weekly incomes of Australian households (GWI) and
the disposable personal weekly incomes (DWI) for the years 1995 and 2010. We have
omitted the categories of ‘negative income’ and ‘no income’, because their eﬀect on our
analysis is negligible compared to the right tail of large incomes. Note in particular that
for the 1995 GWI data the last category ‘$5000 or more’ has lower bound xq = 5000,
where q = 1 − 57.7/(72.9 + ··· + 57.7) = 0.991. We do not want to ignore this category.

Figure 6: Solid lines show kernel density plots of the populations constructed from the categorical data in
Table 5 using Pareto a = 4 tails. For details, see Section 4.3. The dashed lines show density plots of samples
of size 500 from each of the respective populations. The rounded sample quartiles for the top left are 487, 985,
1653 amd the maximum was 6779. For the top right they are 701, 1310, 2335 and the maximum 15490. For
the bottom left 299, 444, 665 and 2560; while for the bottom right they are 496. 764, 1161 amd 9166.

Lacking the individual data, we can create an (admittedly ad hoc) population to take
samples from. We do this by generating uniformly distributed variables over each category,
starting with 729 observations uniformly between 0 and 100, 755 observations uniformly
between 100 and 200, and so on. For the last category we generate 577 random Pareto(a, λ)
observations follows: ﬁrst, for a > 0, ﬁnd the scale parameter λ = xq/{(1− q)−1/a− 1} =
5000/{(1 − 0.991)−1/a − 1}; second, generate 577 ui from [0.991,1]; and third, apply the
quantile function to these values Qa,λ(ui) = λ{(1 − ui)−1/a − 1}.

A kernel density estimate of this population data for a = 4 is shown as a solid curve
in the upper left plot of Figure 6. The density plot has been truncated at 7000 but the
maximum value in this population is actually 27880. The quartiles are 476, 948 and 1602.
The other populations GWI-2010, DWI-1995 and DWI-2010, are similarly constructed
and plotted for a = 4. Other populations were also constructed for a = 1, 2 and 3 but are
not shown; needless to say their outlying observations tend to be even larger.

Now we are able to show the results of taking random samples of size n = 500 from
each of the four populations. For the case of a = 4 density plots of these samples are
shown in dashed lines in Figure 6. In Table 6 we can see that for a = 1 or 2 the estimated
standard errors of ˆG are larger than for a = 3 and a = 4, making comparisons between
results from diﬀerent years 1995 and 2010 highly dependent on the unknown a, which is
diﬃcult to estimate. On the other hand, for ˆI the standard errors do not depend at all
on these choices of a.

4.4 Numbers of visits to Doctors, by gender

A major Health and Retirement study in the United States surveys adults every 2 years
after they reach the age of 50. The AHEAD cohort consisted of persons born in the United
States before 1924 (and their spouses, regardless of age). The data includes observations
on the number of visits to doctors and 24 concomitant variables; it is analyzed by classical
MLE and robust regression methods in (Heritier et al., 2009, Sec. 5.6). The data are found
via the website

An empirical probability mass function for females and males is provided in Plots A
and B of Figure 7 respectively. It is immediately clear that the extrema for females are
larger than that for males, suggesting increased variability in the female population.

In Table 7 we provide point and interval estimates for each of G and I for males and
females and also estimates for the diﬀerent between the two. Both measures suggest a
moderate degree of inequality and, interestingly, neither suggest that there is a diﬀerence
in inequality between males and females. In Plots C and D we provide the reciprocal of
the empirical quantile density function for females and males. The shapes of each are

similar which further conﬁrms that inequality should be approximately the same. We can
show with this data set that the estimator of G is more heavily inﬂuenced by just one
observation. We removed the largest observation from the male data set and recalculated
the intervals (these are denoted by M* in the table). While the estimates for I and the
diﬀerence for I between males and females are almost identical to those from the full
data, we note a bigger change when using the Gini index. In fact, the estimated interval
for the diﬀerence between males and females comes very close to suggesting a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence and many would use this interval to conclude that there is indeed a diﬀerence.

5 Summary and further possible work

We proposed an inequality measure I that depends only on the area between the symmet-
ric ratio of quantiles curve {(p, R(p)} and the horizontal line at one. The measure I has
the simple interpretation as the average relative distance of a randomly chosen income
from the lower half of incomes to its symmetric quantile. This inequality measure is easy
to estimate using distribution-free methods, and is demonstratively resistant to outliers.
Despite its simplicity, in many cases it is a more eﬀective measure than the Gini index
which can be non-robust and more heavily biased, as shown in the simulations and exam-

An R script for plotting the inequality curve {(p, R(p)} and ﬁnding the estimates of
I and its standard error, as well as conﬁdence intervals for I is included in supplementary
on-line material.

In the Appendix we considered some examples illustrating cases where the inequality
curve is convex, and it would be of interest to ﬁnd simple conditions on the underlying
income distribution for which this is the case. Another research area of interest is to
ﬁnd a quantile-based measure of inequality for which the measure applied to a mixture
of income distributions is the same or related mixture of the inequality measures of the
components, at least to a good approximation. Finally it would be useful to show how
various factors aﬀect I, or some function thereof, in a regression setting.

B Convexity of R
In this section we restrict attention to F ∈ F(cid:48)(cid:48), deﬁned by

F(cid:48)(cid:48) = {F ∈ F(cid:48) : f(cid:48) = F (cid:48)(cid:48) exists.}

17

This guarantees the existence of the quantile density q(p) = Q(cid:48)(p) as well as its derivative
q(cid:48)(p) = − f(cid:48)(xp)/f 3(xp) = J(p)q2(p). For possible further use we note that the score
function for a location-scale family is deﬁned for each p by J(p) = −f(cid:48)(xp)/f (xp); it
arises in nonparametric statistics Hajek & Sidak (1967). Parzen (1979) notes that J(p) =
− d
dp f (Q(p)). Further, the score function for a scale family is deﬁned for each p by
K(p) = −1 + Q(p)J(p). Some examples of these functions are collected in Table 8. Note
that K(p) = −a − 2 is free of p for the Type I Pareto distribution.
We now seek restrictions on the family F(cid:48)(cid:48) for which the quantile ratio curves are
convex. To examine the convexity of R we need to ﬁnd an expression for R(cid:48)(cid:48), and to
ﬁnd the derivatives of R it is convenient to introduce HQ(p) = ∂ ln(Q(p))
= q(p)/Q(p) for
0 < p < 1. Then

B.2 Type II Pareto

The function t(p) is messier to compute for the Type II Pareto model, but a plot of t(p)
versus p for various a is shown in Figure 8. These and other plots convince us that R is
convex for all values of a > 0.

Figure 8: Plot of t(p) versus p for the Type II Pareto(a) model and for the Weibull(β) model. For the Type
II Pareto, the solid line is for a = 0.5, the dashed line for a = 1, and dotted line a = 2 and and the dot-dashed
line a = 5. For the Weibull, the solid line is for β = 1, the dashed line for β = 1.1, the dotted line for β = 1.25
and and the dot-dashed line β = 1.5.

B.3 Weibull

The function t(p) is also messy to compute for the Weibull model, but a plot of t(p) versus
p for various a is shown in Figure 8. These and other plots suggest that t(p) > 0 for all
0 < p < 1 (and hence the ratio R is convex) for all β < 1.04. For β > 1.05 they are
negative for small p, and hence not convex; some examples are plotted in Figure 1.
What the above examples show is that convexity of the ratio of symmetric quantiles
R(p) = xp/2/x1−p/2 is not a common attribute for F ∈ F, although it does hold for Type I
and II Pareto models, Weibull models with small β (including the exponential), and that
it holds for the log-normal model except when p < 0.045, where it is nearly linear. This
lack of convexity might be considered a disadvantage relative to Lorenz curves, which are
always convex when they are deﬁned, but R is not only deﬁned for all F ∈ F, it has a
greater range of values and can be estimated by distribution-free methods.
