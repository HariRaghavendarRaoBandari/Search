ABSTRACT

We present measurements of the spatial clustering statistics in redshift space of various scalar ﬁeld modiﬁed gravity simulations. We
utilise the two-point and the three-point correlation functions to quantify the spatial distribution of dark matter halos within these
simulations and thus discern between the models. We compare ΛCDM simulations to various modiﬁed gravity scenarios and ﬁnd
consistency with previous work in terms of 2-point statistics in real and redshift-space. However using higher order statistics such
as the three-point correlation function in redshift space we ﬁnd signiﬁcant deviations from ΛCDM hinting that higher order statistics
may prove to be a useful tool in the hunt for deviations from General Relativity.

1. Introduction

The ΛCDM cosmological model has been shown to reproduce
many observational measurements, from the CMB at very early
times to the late time clustering of galaxies. Despite the suc-
cesses of the model, certain issues remain to be fully explained.
These are either conceptual or arise from conﬂict with obser-
vational constraints. One of the main problems consist of the
fact that the nature of the two main ingredients of the model
(dark matter and dark energy) remains unknown. Among the
diﬀerent solutions to the philosophical and quantitative incon-
sistencies associated with these components, exists the idea of
modifying the gravitational theory. Several alternative theories
exist (Clifton et al. 2012; Amendola et al. 2012), all of which
include extra degrees of freedom in the form of scalar, vector,
or even tensor ﬁelds. As General Relativity (GR) is proven to
be valid to high accuracy on solar system scales (Will 2014),
any modiﬁcation introduced must reduce to GR in these scales,
which is done through screening mechanisms. Within the con-
text of scalar-tensor theories, there are three of such mecha-
nisms based on conformal couplings, namely Vainshtein (Vain-
shtein 1972), Symmetron (Hinterbichler & Khoury 2010) and
Chameleon (Khoury & Weltman 2004).
In addition to this,
Koivisto et al. (2012) recently proposed a mechanism which is
based on a disformal coupling.

Since all the above modiﬁed gravity models with a screen-
ing mechanisms seem to be viable, the question arises: How
to distinguish the diﬀerent models using cosmological observa-
tions? Since the eﬀects of the forces associated to the extra de-
gree of freedom emerge during the onset of non-linear structure
formation, the latter is a promising tool to rule out some of the
above models. The nonlinear eﬀects arising from these screening
mechanisms have been studied using cosmological N-body sim-
ulations(Oyaizu 2008; Schmidt 2009; Li et al. 2011; Lombriser
et al. 2013; Boehmer & Mota 2008; Zhao et al. 2011; Zhao et al.
2011; Barreira et al. 2013).

Second order clustering statistics have been used to investi-
gate diﬀerences between ΛCDM and modiﬁed gravity models,
particularly Hinterbichler et al. (2011); Brax et al. (2011); Jen-
nings et al. (2012); Brax et al. (2012) and recently Song et al.
(2015) have put observational bounds on fR0 using SDSS data.
Another novel technique for probing modiﬁed gravity involv-
ing second order statistics was investigated by Lombriser et al.
(2015) using the density-ﬁeld clipping method (Simpson et al.
2011, 2013). They found that constraints on f (R) gravity can
be tightened when clipping the density ﬁeld with a high thresh-
old since contributions of screened high-density regions to the
matter power spectrum will be reduced, boosting the modiﬁed
gravity eﬀects.

However in this paper we will focus on higher-order cluster-
ing statistics in redshift-space as a tool for diﬀerentiating modi-
ﬁed gravity models (as alternatives to dark energy) from a ﬁdu-
cial GR model. Three point functions were studied in the linear
regime for general scalar tensor theories in theories that range
from Galileons to the most general Horndesky theories (Bartolo
et al. 2013; Takushima et al. 2014; Bellini et al. 2015). The non-
linear regime was studied by Gil-Marín et al. (2011) in the f (R)
case. Here we repeat the calculations for the same f (R) model,
but extend this previous study in two ways. Firstly, we run sim-
ulations with a code that includes an adaptive mesh reﬁnement
structure (AMR) giving a much more accurate description of the
clustering, especially on small scales. Secondly, we focus our
study not only on the real space correlation functions, but also
on the redshift space ones, which are ultimately the ones that
can be observed. Furthermore, we also present predictions for
the symmetron model in addition to f (R).

The paper is structured as follows: In §2 we discuss the
scalar ﬁeld models investigated and brieﬂy describe the numeri-
cal simulations which are used. In §3 we layout our framework
for analysing the numerical simulations and discuss our speciﬁc
implementation of the two and three-point clustering statistics

that we use. We present our clustering results for the various
models in §4 and ﬁnally conclude in §5.

2. The models and simulations
2.1. Thegravitationalmodels

We focus our analysis on two speciﬁc scalar tensor models: the
symmetron model and a particular case of f (R) theories. Both
models include screening mechanisms, which reduce them to
GR in high density regions and thus make them able to pass so-
lar system tests. Below we summarise particulars of the models.
In both cases, we will work in the Einstein frame and thus, Ein-
stein’s equation will be unchanged. The dominant dynamical
eﬀects will appear as a modiﬁcation of the geodesics equation
that is used to track the motion of the particles, which now will
include a ﬁfth force term.

2.1.1. The symmetron model

The symmetron model was originally discussed in (Pietroni
2005; Olive & Pospelov 2008; Hinterbichler & Khoury 2010) as
a standard scalar tensor model which has a particular coupling
to matter. The model includes a screening mechanism based
on the restoration of a particular symmetry. The cosmology of
this model at the background and linear perturbation level has
been studied in Hinterbichler et al. (2011); Brax et al. (2011). In
the non-linear case, there are several results coming from quasi-
static non-linear N-body cosmological simulations (Davis et al.
2012; Brax et al. 2012; Llinares et al. 2014). The eﬀect of non-
static terms in these simulations was presented in ref. (Llinares
& Mota 2013, 2014).

The action of the symmetron model is given by

where Φ is a scalar perturbation (i.e. the gravitational potential
in a classical context), we can write the equation of motion of
the scalar ﬁeld in the following form:

∇2φ = (cid:18) ρ

M2 − µ2(cid:19) φ + λφ3 =

d
dφ

Ve f f (φ),

(8)

where ρ is the Jordan frame matter density and the eﬀective po-
tential is given by

Ve f f (φ) =

1

2 (cid:18) ρ

M2 − µ2(cid:19) φ2 +

1
4

λφ4 + V0.

(9)

From this equation, one can see that the expectation value of
the scalar ﬁeld vanishes at high matter densities. This sets the
conformal factor A to unity and thus decouples the scalar from
the matter, producing the screening of the ﬁfth force.

For numerical convenience, we work with a dimensionless
scalar ﬁeld χ ≡ φ/φ0, where φ0 is the expectation value for ρ =
0:

φ0 =

µ
√λ

.

(10)

We also substitute the three free parameters (M, µ, λ) by the
range of the ﬁeld that corresponds to ρ = 0,

tonian time deﬁned by eq. 7.

2.1.2. The f (R) model

Among the large number of f (R) models that exist in the liter-
ature we choose the model presented in Hu & Sawicki (2007),
which has attracted large interest in the context of dark energy
models. See Lombriser (2014) for a review on observational
constraints on the model. In the context of non-linear structure
formation which we study here, there are several N-body codes
capable of simulating this model (Oyaizu 2008; Li et al. 2012;

C. Sabiu et al.: Probing scalar tensor theories for gravity in Redshift-Space

Puchwein et al. 2013; Llinares et al. 2014). The validity of the
quasi-static approximation assumed in this codes was studied in
detail in the linear and non-linear regime in Noller et al. (2014);
Bose et al. (2015).

The action that deﬁnes the model is

possible to reduce the number of free parameters from three to

where ΩΛ is the density parameter associated to the cosmolog-

2.2. TheN-bodycode

The simulations were run with the code Isis (Llinares et al.
2014), which is a modiﬁed gravity version of the code Ram-
ses (Teyssier 2002). The code is a particle mesh code which
includes adaptive mesh reﬁnements and thus, can increase the
resolution of the solutions when needed (i.e. in the centre of the
dark matter halos). In order to solve the equations for the scalar
ﬁeld, the code uses a non-linear version of the linear multigrid
solver with which Ramses solves Poisson’s equation. The solver
works by doing Gauss-Seidel iterations on the discretised ver-
sion of the equations to ﬁnd improved solutions based on an ini-
tial guess. Given the multi-scale properties of the problem, the
solver makes also iterations on coarse grids, which can increase
the speed of convergence by several orders of magnitude. The
code is the only one present in the literature that can solve in an
explicit way the scalar ﬁeld equations out of the static limit. This
non-static solver was already applied to symmetron and disfor-
mal gravity models (Llinares & Mota 2014; Hagala et al. 2016).
A comparison between the accuracy of this code and other codes
that solve the same set of equations can be found in Winther et al.
(2015).

2.3. Simulations

The data to be used for the analysis was obtained from a set
of simulations that were run with both standard gravity and the
two modiﬁed gravity models. Table 1 summarises the model
parameters. The initial conditions were generated assuming
that the scalar ﬁeld is fully screened at high redshift and thus,
the Zel’dovich approximation is valid for all the models. To
generate the only set of initial conditions we used the pack-
age Cosmics (Bertschinger 1995). The box size and number
of particles employed are 256 Mpc/h and 5123. The back-
ground cosmology is also the same for all the simulations and
is deﬁned as a ﬂat ΛCDM model given by (Ωm, ΩΛ, H0) =
(0.267, 0.733, 71.9 km/sec/Mpc).
The simulations are nor-
malised using the linearly extrapolated value of σ8 at redshift
zero. All the simulations have the same normalisation, which is
necessary if we want all the simulations to be consistent with the
CMB. The simulations where run up to redshift zero, which is
the moment in which we make our analysis. Furthermore, all the
simulations use the same background cosmology with exactly
the same initial conditions (i.e. with the same initial seed for the
random numbers generator). Thus we assume the eﬀects of the
scalar ﬁeld appear only because of the existence of a ﬁfth force
in the perturbation level.

The power spectrum of the initial conditions are not nor-
malised to CMB measurements, but rather are normalised using
a redshift zero σ8 which is evolved back in time with linear New-
tonian theory. This is a standard approach within the community,
however this method has the drawback that the ﬁnal normalisa-
tion of the simulation cannot be completely controlled due to
the presence of the ﬁfth force in the modiﬁed gravity models.
Regardless, even changes in clustering amplitudes should be in-
vestigated within the domain of modiﬁed gravity theories.

In order to investigate the clustering of dark matter haloes,
we make use of halo catalogues that were obtained with phase-
space, friends-of-friends (FOF) code Rockstar (Behroozi et al.
2013). The samples used for the analysis include all the halos
reported by the halo ﬁnder with no discrimination between viri-
alized and non-virialized objects. The halo catalogue has a cut
oﬀ for low mass halos at 20 particles per halo that corresponds to
a minimum halo mass of 1.85× 1011M
⊙/h. The same cut oﬀ was

used for all the simulations. We have compared the halo mass
function from these simulations with higher resolution simula-
tions and with theoretical models and ﬁnd no bias in using 20
particles to deﬁne the halos.

For details on the implementation of the modiﬁed equations
on the code Isis and on the simulations we refer the reader to
Llinares et al. (2014).

3. Correlation Statistics

We wish to quantify the spatial clustering of the simulated halos
so that we can compare more easily between models. To achieve
this we calculate the two and three-point correlation functions
using well known estimators, which are described below.

3.1. Two-pointcorrelationfunction

We estimate the full two point correlation function (2PCF) of
the DM halo distribution in each of the simulations listed in Ta-
ble 1. The 2PCF is estimated in real and redshift-space and in
both isotropic and anisotropic σ, π-decompositions. The correla-
tion functions are calculated using the “Landy-Szalay" estimator
(Landy & Szalay 1993),

ξ(r) =

DD(r) − 2DR(r) + RR(r)

RR(r)

,

(27)

where DD(r) is the number of data–data pairs, DR the number
of data-random pairs, and RR is the number of random–random
pairs, all separated by a displacement vector r and properly nor-
malised. In the isotropic case we measure ξ(r) with no angular
dependence and we choose the binning r = 0 → 60Mpc/h in 20
linearly spaced bins. The number of random particles used to
deﬁne the unclustered reference sample is ≈20 times the number
of halo particles. This is done to reduce statistical ﬂuctuation
due to poisson noise in the random pair counting.

In the anisotropic analysis we decompose the vector r into a
line of sight distance component σ and a perpendicular com-
ponent π. Then we proceed to measure ξ(σ, π) from σ and
π = 0 → 60 Mpc in 15 linearly spaced bins, resulting in 225
bins in the σ − π space.

3.2. Three-pointcorrelationfunction

Higher order correlations are usually denoted as ξn(r1, ...., rn),
where n is the order of the correlation function. As an exam-
ple, the 3PCF is deﬁned as the joint probability of there being a
galaxy in each of the volume elements dV1, dV2 and dV3 given
that these elements are arranged in a conﬁguration deﬁned by the
sides of the triangle, r1, r2 and r3. The joint probability can be
written as

dP1,2,3 = ¯n3[1 + ξ(r1) + ξ(r2) + ξ(r3) + ζ(r1, r2, r3)]dV1dV2dV3.

Article number, page 4 of 7

(28)

The expression above consists of several parts, it contains the
sum of correlations for each side of the triangle and ζ, the full
three-point correlation function and ¯n is the mean density of
data points. We utilise the 3PCF estimator of Szapudi & Sza-
lay (1998),

ζ =

DDD − 3DDR + 3DRR − RRR

RRR

,

(29)

where each term represents the normalised triplet counts in the
data (D) and random (R) ﬁelds that satisfy a particular triangular
conﬁguration.

The 3PCF is a function of three variables that uniquely de-
ﬁne a triangular conﬁguration. The shape parameters can either
be the three sides of the triangle, (r1, r2, r3), or more commonly
(s, q, θ) where,

s = r1,
r2
q =
r1

,

θ = cos−1(ˆr1.ˆr2).

(30)

(31)

(32)

In Eq 32 ˆri is the unit vector of side i of the triangle. The 3PCF
is usually calculated in various conﬁgurations where s and q are
ﬁxed while θ is varied from 0◦ to 180◦.

In our analysis we focus on several triangular conﬁgurations,
s = 2, 3Mpc/h and q = 1, 2 with each probing 8 equally spaced
bins in cos θ.

4. Results

In this section we will present the results of our clustering statis-
tics for the various models, in real and redshift spaces.

4.1. Two-PointFunctionResults
In Fig.1 we show the relative diﬀerence, ∆ξ(r) = (ξmod(r) −
ξΛCDM)/ ¯ξ(r) between the 2PCF (calculated from Eq. 27) of the
modiﬁed gravity simulations, discussed in §2, compared to the
ΛCDM case and ¯ξ is the mean value of of the both.2PCFs The
left hand plot shows the relative diﬀerence between the 2PCF
of the dark matter halos in real comoving space, while the right
hand plot shows the 2PCF in redshift space.

The errors on ξ(r) were derived using the jackknife
method Scranton et al. (2002), which involves dividing the simu-
lation box into N sub-sections with equal volume and then com-
puting the mean and variance of ξ(r) from these N measurements
of the correlation function with the ith region removed each time
(where i = 1...N). In our analysis, we choose N = 27 and deter-
mine the variance from Lupton (1993),

σ2

ξ(ri) =

N jk − 1

where N jk is the number of jackknife samples used and ri repre-
sents a single bin in the ξ(r) conﬁguration space and ξ(ri) is the
mean of the jackknifed samples. Although not exact, the jack-
knife variance estimate will inform us if any deviations in the
statistics between the ΛCDM model and modiﬁed gravity are
signiﬁcant and above the sampling noise. Of course this vari-
ance will not inform us of the detectability of any deviation in a
particular current or future observational dataset.

left: The fractional diﬀerence between the 2PCF measurements of dark matter halos within modiﬁed gravity and ΛCDM simulations in

Considering ﬁrst the real-space 2PCF in the left plot of Fig.1
all the models, except for the weakest f(R) model FOFR6,
show signiﬁcant deviation from the ΛCDM case on scales < 30
Mpc/h. In redshift space, we observe a similar amount deviation
from the ΛCDM case, with slightly more suppression on small
scales.

The shapes of these curves suggest two things: That the
small scale clustering amplitude of the modiﬁed gravity simu-
lations maybe slightly lower than that of ΛCDM and that the
non-linear, small scale, velocities may be higher in the modiﬁed
gravity simulations, which would suppress clustering on small
scales. Our results in Fig.1 for the fofr4 model appear consis-
tent with the level of decrement observed in Taruya et al. (2014)
where they ﬁnd ∆ξ ≈ 13% on scales ∼50 Mpc/h. The lower
amplitude in both the real and redshift-space 2PCF is mainly
due to the bias in the modiﬁed gravity simulation being lower
than ΛCDM. This behaviour of the bias in modiﬁed gravity has
already been suggested in the literature, where a decrease, rela-
tively to ΛCDM, in the dark matter halo halo bias in f(R) gravity
was pointed out by Schmidt et al. (2009) and likewise for the
galaxy bias by Fontanot et al. (2013). However, to fully under-
stand this issue is beyond the scope of this paper, we thus focus
our attention mainly on the diﬀerences between real and redshift
space quantities

So far we have looked at the isotropic 2PCF, however this
is not the most sensitive statistic to the redshift-space distortion
eﬀects. In Fig.2 we show the anisotropic 2PCF decomposed into
distances (σ, π) which correspond to directions across and along
the line of sight.

The four contours correspond to values [0.4, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01].
The green shaded region denote the 1σ error bound around the
ΛCDM value. For clarity we only show the clustering contours
for 3 modiﬁed gravity models; two that exhibit the most devi-
ation from ΛCDM (FOFR4 and SYMMC) and one that shows
very similar clustering signal to ΛCDM (FOFR6). The various
modiﬁed gravity simulations show very similar contours in this
projection, although contours lying close to the line-of-sight ex-
hibit some dispersion, i.e. stronger ﬁngers-of-god (FoG) eﬀect
compared to ΛCDM. Once again the FOFR4 model shows sig-
niﬁcant deviation from ΛCDM, especially on scales below 30
Mpc/h.
However it is the SYMMC model that shows the
most dramatic deviation between the models investigated and
ΛCDM. This eﬀect has to do that, owing to the presence of a ﬁfth
force, velocities are in general lager in modiﬁed gravity theories

simulations, using the dark matter halos in redshift-space. For clar-
ity we show only two extreme cases; FOFR4 (red dashed line) and
SymmC (green solid line) and a mildly deviating model FOFR6 (light
green dashed line). The 4 contour groups correspond to 2PCF values
of [0.4, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01]. The green shaded region denote the 1σ error
bound around the ΛCDM value.

(Gronke et al. 2015; Hellwing et al. 2014). Note that redshift
space distortions were already studied in f (R) gravity by Jen-
nings et al. (2012), however, that work focuses its attention on
the power spectrum of dark matter density perturbations.

4.2. Three-PointFunctionResults

In Fig.3 we show the relative diﬀerence between the 3PCF of
ΛCDM and modiﬁed gravity, ∆ζ, for the triangular conﬁgura-
tion with s = 2 Mpc/h and q = 1, in real space (left panel) and
redshift-space (right panel) for the dark matter halo distribution
in the various models. The sides length for this conﬁguration
span 1.5 < r1 < 2.5, 1.5 < r2 < 2.5, 0 < r3 < 5 and we de-
ﬁne the relative diﬀerence as ∆ζ = (ζmod − ζ ΛCDM)/ζ ΛCDM and
the errorbars are once again estimated via 27 jackknife samples,
and are basically determined by the comic variance of the struc-
tures within our 256 Mpc/h size simulation box. Nevertheless,
smaller deviations between models can be signiﬁcant in a com-
parison between simulations since all runs use the same phases

and amplitudes in the initial conditions. In both panels we show
the relative diﬀerence from the ΛCDM prediction. We observe
a dispersion between models which suggest that the 3PCF alone
is at least as powerful a probe of modiﬁed gravitational cluster-
ing as the 2PCF. However considering that the 3PCF is sensitive
to the bias in a diﬀerent way than the 2PCF, there may also be
the potential to break any degeneracy between bias and modiﬁed
gravity by using a combination of the 2PCF and 3PCF.

In real space the 3PCF of this triangular conﬁguration shows
mild deviation from the ΛCDM model. However in redshift
space, the 3PCF of this conﬁguration shows a larger variation be-
tween models and all the modiﬁed gravity models deviate from
ΛCDM.

In Fig.4 we investigate the 3PCF with triangular conﬁgura-
tion s = 3 Mpc/h and q = 2.
In this case the side lengths cor-
respond to 2.5 < r1 < 3.5, 5.5 < r2 < 6.5, 3 < r3 < 10 and thus
this conﬁguration will preferentially select triplets that occupy
three distinct halos. However in redshift-space the ﬁngers-of-
god eﬀect can bring in a one-halo contribution for ‘closed’ and
‘open’ triangles (i.e. when r3 is 3 or 9 Mpc/h), although the lat-
ter may be on too large a scale to add any signiﬁcant eﬀect. The
one-halo contribution, within the halo model framework (Cooray
& Sheth 2002), is the clustering signal in the 2PCF (or 3PCF)
of pairs (or triplets) of galaxies residing in the same DM halo.
This is opposed to the other contributions from galaxies resid-
ing in separate halos. In redshift-space the clusters of galaxies
can be elongated along the line of sight thus the one-halo term
can be signiﬁcant on slightly larger scales than it would in real-
space.This one-halo contribution could be the one factor in the
large ∆ζ observed at 4-5 Mpc/h in Fig.4.

In the left hand panel we see that in real space the models do
not deviate from ΛCDM signiﬁcantly, expect for the extreme
‘closed’ conﬁguration.
In redshift-space, shown in the right
panel, the models show a similar behaviour however they begin
to diverge at larger opening angles of the triangle.

Our real space clustering measurements support the conclu-
sion of Gil-Marín et al. (2011), where they ﬁnd a weak depen-
dence of the real space reduced bispectrum on | fR0|. However in
Gil-Marín et al. (2011) they look at scales quite outside the clus-
ter size i.e. k ≈ 0.4. In our work looking at the real and redshift-
space full 3PCF on small scales, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant departures
from the LCDM clustering. We suspect that this is due to the
altered velocity distribution in modiﬁed gravity which results in
anisotropic redshift space distortions that can be detected with
higher-order clustering statistics. However this claim should be
tested further in future work.

5. Conclusions

We present the ﬁrst measurements of the higher order cluster-
ing in redshift-space of certain modiﬁed gravity models. Us-
ing the 3-point correlation function we are able to probe devi-
ations in the clustering signal between modiﬁed gravity models
and ΛCDM.

Due to the volume and number of numerical simulations we
used, we show only a qualitative study of the higher order clus-
tering in redshift space. We have shown that the small scale clus-
tering in redshift space is signiﬁcantly altered in the modiﬁed
gravity models we consider when comparing to ΛCDM. This is
especially true for higher order statistics namely the 3PCF.

In this work we have assumed a single set of cosmological
parameters while varying the gravitational force, however the
eﬀect of the modiﬁed gravity on the 2- and 3-point clustering
should be quantiﬁed precisely and checked for any degeneracy

with the cosmological parameters. This will require many N-
body simulations and was therefore out with the scope of our
study, however we hope that this work will prompt further re-
search in this direction.
