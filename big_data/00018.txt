We investigate the potential of the long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE) to study large-extra-dimension (LED) models originally proposed to explain the
smallness of neutrino masses by postulating that right-handed neutrinos, unlike all standard
model fermion ﬁelds, can propagate in the bulk. The massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of
the right-handed neutrino ﬁelds modify the neutrino oscillation probabilities and can hence
aﬀect their propagation. We show that, as far as DUNE is concerned, the LED model is
indistinguishable from a (3 + 3N )-neutrino framework for modest values of N ; N = 1 is
usually a very good approximation. Nonetheless, there are no new sources of CP -invariance
violation other than one CP -odd phase that can be easily mapped onto the CP -odd phase
in the standard three-neutrino paradigm. We analyze the sensitivity of DUNE to the LED
framework, and explore the capability of DUNE to diﬀerentiate the LED model from the
three-neutrino scenario and from a generic (3 + 1)-neutrino model.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrino oscillation experiments have revolutionized our understanding of the neutrino sector of
the standard model (SM). It is now established that at least two of the three known neutrinos are
massive, and that the mass and ﬂavor eigenstates are distinct. There are still several unanswered
questions in neutrino physics, including the neutrino mass hierarchy, the potential existence of new
neutrino states, and the status of CP invariance in the lepton sector. To address these questions
and further investigate the neutrino oscillation phenomenon, we need a new generation of neutrino
oscillation experiments. The long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) in
the U.S. [1, 2] and the Hyper-Kamiokande (HyperK) experiment in Japan [3] are proposed to
answer these and several other questions, and are poised to provide qualitatively better and more
precise tests of the current three-massive-neutrinos paradigm.

Although the absolute neutrino masses are not yet determined, we can indirectly infer from
cosmic surveys that the known neutrino masses are below the eV-scale [4]. Similar bounds, albeit
weaker but more direct, come from kinematical probes of nonzero neutrino masses [5, 6]. The
fact that neutrino masses are much smaller than all known fermion masses in the SM is widely
interpreted as evidence that the mechanism behind neutrino masses is diﬀerent from that of all
other known particles. The hypothesis that there are more, compactiﬁed dimensions of space,
and that these are large (i.e., much larger than the inverse of the Planck mass) was introduced
in order to address the infamous SM hierarchy problem [7–9], and also provides a mechanism for
understanding why neutrino masses are parametrically smaller than charged-fermion masses. In
these large-extra-dimension (LED) models, it is natural to assume that singlets of the SM gauge
group, such as the graviton or the right-handed neutrino states, can propagate unconstrained in
all dimensions, while the SM-charged objects are conﬁned to a four-dimensional spacetime.
If

2

there are right-handed neutrino ﬁelds that propagate in the bulk (or a subset of the bulk), the
equivalent four-dimensional neutrino Yukawa couplings are suppressed relative to charged-fermion
Yukawa couplings by a factor proportional to the volume of the extra dimensions [10, 11]. In these
scenarios, neutrinos are very light for the same reason gravity appears to be very weakly coupled.
The Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the higher-dimensional right-handed neutrino ﬁelds behave
as an inﬁnite tower of sterile neutrinos.
If these are light enough, one expects deviations from
the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm in neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino oscillation
phenomenology of LED models has been extensively studied in the literature (see, for example,
Refs. [12–18]). It has also been proposed [19] that the reactor anomaly can be explained within the
LED framework. More generically, the equivalence between the LED model and a framework with
several sterile neutrinos was discussed in [20]. Other phenomenological aspects of LED models and
their application to nonzero neutrino masses have also been explored in depth in the literature (see
for example, Refs. [21, 22]).

We study the potential of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to exclude or
observe the eﬀects of the LED model, and investigate how well DUNE can constrain the LED
parameters. Highlights include the discussion of CP -invariance violation phenomena in the LED
model using the DUNE experiment. Several other new physics scenarios can be studied using
the precise measurements of the DUNE experiment. The capability of DUNE to test the one-
sterile neutrino hypothesis was recently explored in detail in Ref. [23, 24] while the eﬀects of non-
standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos were investigated in [25–28]. Here, we also explore the
ability of DUNE to diﬀerentiate the LED hypothesis from the three-neutrino and the four-neutrino
hypotheses.

The paper is organized as follows: We discuss the LED formalism and the related neutrino
oscillation probabilities in Section II. The sensitivity of DUNE to the LED hypothesis is studied
in Section III, and we demonstrate the capability of DUNE to measure non-zero LED parameters
in Section IV. Section V is devoted to studying the ability of DUNE to diﬀerentiate qualitatively
distinct scenarios. We summarize our results and oﬀer some conclusions in Section VI.

II. FORMALISM AND OSCILLATION PROBABILITIES

In this section we discuss the neutrino oscillation probabilities in LED models, and restrict our
discussion to models with one relevant extra-dimension. We extend the SM with three massless
ﬁve-dimensional gauge singlet fermions Ψα ≡ (ψα
R) associated to the three active neutrinos
να
L. The indices α correspond to e, µ, τ , in spite of the fact that there are no charged leptons
associated to Ψα. The ﬁfth dimension is compactiﬁed with periodic boundary conditions in such
a way that, from a four-dimensional point of view, Ψα can be decomposed into a tower of Kaluza-
Klein (KK) states ψ(n)
and

CP -invariance violation in the neutrino sector manifests itself as an asymmetry between the
oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos. In the three-neutrino scenario, the only
source of CP violation (if the neutrinos are Dirac particles, which is the case here) is the phase
δ13 in the leptonic mixing matrix U . In a generic 3 + 3N massive Dirac neutrinos framework there
are (3N + 2)(3N + 1)/2 − 1 CP -odd phases beyond δ13 associated to the (3 + 3N ) × (3 + 3N )
unitary mixing matrix. In the LED model, however, the (3 + 3N ) × (3 + 3N ) unitary matrix W is
not generic. As we can see from Eq. (II.12), all the elements of W are proportional to Uαi so all
the new CP phases are functions of δ13. Hence, while many of the elements of W have nonzero
CP -odd phases, no new CP -violating parameters are introduced within the LED framework. In
other words, CP -violating phenomena are governed by the higher-dimensional neutrino Yukawa
couplings, which deﬁne a 3× 3 matrix. This is identical to the familiar four-dimensional case when
the neutrinos are Dirac fermions.
For illustrative purposes, we evaluate the S matrix numerically for RED = 5 × 10−5 cm =
(0.38 eV)−1 and m0 = 5 × 10−2 eV. The corresponding neutrino mixing matrix W is, for the NH

where Uαi are parameterized by θij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, i < j, in the usual way [31]. From Eq. (II.15), it
is easy to see that Wαi ∼ Uαi for the mostly active states (i = 1, 2, 3), while the top-left (3 × 3)-
submatrix of W is not quite unitary. The slow decrease of S as the KK-number increases can be
readily observed. It is also easy to see that the eﬀects of the mass eigenstates 7, 8, 9, proportional
to |U|2 are suppressed relative to those of states 4, 5, 6 by a factor of four. One can quickly check
that all are signiﬁcantly smaller than |Ue3|2 (|0.14Ue1|2 ∼ 0.01 is the largest |Uαi| for i = 7, 8, 9 in
Eq. (II.15)). Furthermore, the oscillation frequencies associated to these states are also four times
larger than those from the ﬁrst KK mode and, for the RED values of interest, their eﬀects always
average out at long-baseline experiments like DUNE. For all these reasons, one set of KK modes is,
for DUNE neutrino energies and LED parameters of interest, a good proxy for the LED scenario.
As mentioned earlier, all results discussed henceforth were computed including the eﬀects of two
KK modes (hence a 3+6 model).

When simulating data consistent with the LED hypothesis, we have to include input values for
the θij parameters. When doing that, we try to emulate as well as possible the current best-ﬁt
values, which we take to represent the existing neutrino data. In order to do that, we assume that
the information that the current data provide for the three-neutrino mixing matrix elements Uαi
applies to Wαi for i = 1, 2, 3. Hence, the best-ﬁt value for the LED parameter sin2 θ13, for example,
is not identical to that of the three-neutrino parameter sin2 θ13 = 0.0219 [31]. They are, however,
similar and related. For R−1
ED = 0.38 eV, m0 = 5 × 10−2 eV, and the NH, the best ﬁt value for
(sin2 θ13)LED = 0.0219/0.942 = 0.025 (see Eq. (II.15)). This recipe cannot be followed exactly, so we
decide on the best-ﬁt, input values for the LED θij parameters by equating the |We2|,|We3|,|Wµ3|
to the best-ﬁt values of |Ue2|,|Ue3|,|Uµ3| obtained in the three-neutrino framework.
To understand the eﬀect of the LED parameters on the oscillation of neutrinos, we show in Fig. 1
the probabilities of νµ → νe (top-left) and ¯νµ → ¯νe (top-right) as well as the survival probabilities
of νµ (bottom-left) and ¯νµ (bottom-right) in the energy range of DUNE for the three-neutrino
scheme and the LED formalism with dashed and solid curves, respectively. In all the panels we
have ﬁxed the parameter ∆m2
j1, j = 2, 3 and θij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, i < j, to the best ﬁt values reported
in Ref. [31] (see also Table I), for 3 diﬀerent values of δ13. For the LED hypothesis, we further
choose m0 = 5 × 10−2 eV and R−1
ED = (5 × 10−5 cm)−1 = 0.38 eV. We see that for ﬁxed values
of θij, the oscillation probabilities in the LED case are suppressed with respect to the three-ﬂavor
scenario, as discussed above. This eﬀect can be partially remedied by increasing the values of the
LED θij parameters. Fig. 1 also clearly depicts the fast oscillations associated to the presence of
the KK modes.

III. EXCLUDING THE LED HYPOTHESIS

In this section we investigate the sensitivity of DUNE to the model described in Sec. II. We
assume, as laid out in [1, 2], that DUNE is comprised of a 34-kiloton liquid argon detector located
1300 km from the neutrino source at Fermilab. The neutrino or antineutrino beam is produced
by directing a 1.2 MW beam of protons onto a ﬁxed target. We use the neutrino ﬂuxes and
reconstruction eﬃciencies reported in Ref. [32]‡ to calculate event yields, as well as the neutrino-
nucleon cross-sections reported in Ref. [33]. The neutrino energies range from 0.5 GeV to 20.0
GeV with maximum ﬂux at around 3.0 GeV. Events are binned in 0.25 GeV bins from 0.5 GeV
to 8.0 GeV, resulting in 30 independent counting measurements for each of the four data samples

‡ These are similar but not identical to the ones discussed in Ref. [2]. Ref. [2] reports updated reconstruction
eﬃciencies which lead to reduced neutral current backgrounds for the appearance channels.
In this light, our
results can be viewed as somewhat conservative.

discussed below. Our analysis thus contains 120 degrees of freedom before subtracting the number
of parameters describing any particular hypothesis. We simulate a detector resolution of σ[GeV] =

0.15/(cid:112)E[GeV] for electrons and σ[GeV] = 0.20/(cid:112)E[GeV] for muons, and assume three years of

operation each for the neutrino beam and the antineutrino beam.

When generating data assuming the standard three-neutrino framework, we assume the best-ﬁt
values for the oscillation parameters from Ref. [31], summarized in Table I. Since the neutrino
mass hierarchy is unknown, we simulate data using either the normal hierarchy (NH) or inverted
hierarchy (IH). We assume, however, that the hierarchy will be known by the time DUNE collects
data and therefore analyze the simulated data with the correct hierarchy hypothesis.

TABLE I: Best-ﬁt values of three-neutrino mixing parameters assuming the normal or inverted mass hier-
archy. Values come from the 2015 update to Ref. [31], and the parameter |Ue2|2, which is used later in our
analysis, is derived from the ﬁts to sin2 θ12 and sin2 θ13. While there exist, currently, weak constraints on
the CP -odd parameter δ13, we work under the assumption that it is unconstrained.

Fig. 2 displays expected event yields for neutrino appearance (P (νµ → νe), top-left), antineu-
trino appearance (P (¯νµ → ¯νe), top-right), neutrino disappearance (P (νµ → νµ), bottom-left), and
antineutrino disappearance (P (¯νµ → ¯νµ), bottom-right). In each panel, the expected event yield at
DUNE is displayed for a three-neutrino hypothesis with parameters from Table I for the normal hi-
erarchy, δ13 = 0, and for a non-zero LED hypothesis with all homonymous parameters the same plus
m0 = 5 × 10−2 eV and (RED)−1 = 0.38 eV.§ The dominant backgrounds are neutral-current scat-
tering of muon-neutrinos (“νµ NC”); charged-current scattering of tau-neutrinos (“νµ → ντ CC”);
neutral-current scattering of unoscillated muon-type neutrinos (“νµ → νµ NC”); and charged-
current scattering of unoscillated, contaminant electron-type neutrinos (“νe → νe CC”). The rates
of these processes are estimated from Ref. [32], and are not recalculated in our analyses for dif-
ferent hypotheses, as 1% signal and 5% background normalization uncertainties overwhelm any
noticeable eﬀects.
We analyze pseudodata simulated under the standard three-neutrino framework plus δ13 = 0
with the LED hypothesis. The resulting 95% conﬁdence level (CL) limit in the R−1
ED–m0 plane
is shown in black in Fig. 3(a) for the NH and in Fig. 3(b) for the IH. In the analysis, following
Refs. [23, 27], we include priors on the solar parameters in order to take constraints from solar
and KamLAND data into account. More concretely, we add Gaussian priors on ∆m2
21 using the
information in Table I, and on |We2|2 using the information for |Ue2|2 tabulated in Table I. In the
analysis, we marginalize over all parameters not made explicit in the ﬁgures. We have repeated
the analysis for several nontrivial input values of δ13 and ﬁnd the corresponding exclusion limits
to be similar to the ones depicted in Fig. 3.

§ This is done for illustrative purposes only. The set of LED parameters that best mimics the three-ﬂavor paradigm
will have best-ﬁt values of, for example, θij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, i < j, that are diﬀerent from the input three-ﬂavor values
for θij, as discussed earlier.

in Ref. [19]. All these curves have, to zeroth order, the same shape as the exclusion curve we obtain
for DUNE. This happens because the ratio of m0 and R−1

eV and R−1
i1, i = 1, 2 are in Table I. The input values
for the mixing angles are, for the NH, sin2 θ12 = 0.322, sin2 θ13 = 0.0247, sin2 θ23 = 0.581, and, for the IH,
sin2 θ12 = 0.343, sin2 θ13 = 0.0231, sin2 θ23 = 0.541.

ED = 0.38 eV, while δ13 = π/3. The input values of ∆m2

framework is outside the scope of this work. However, we believe the dotted gray lines capture the
spirit of potential cosmological bounds in the R−1
ED–m0 plane, especially if one allows for possible
extensions of the LED scenario under consideration here.

IV. MEASURING LED PARAMETERS

In this section we simulate data consistent with the LED hypothesis and investigate how well
DUNE is capable of measuring the new-physics parameters m0 and R−1
ED in tandem with the other
oscillation parameters, introduced in Sec. II. As input, we use the values for ∆m2
i1, i = 2, 3 tabulated
in Table I, for the normal and inverted hierarchies, and choose δ13 = π/3, m0 = 5 × 10−2 eV, and
R−1
ED = 0.38 eV. We choose these values to be in the region excluded by DUNE shown in Fig. 3.
As discussed earlier, we choose θij, i, j = 1, 2, 3, i < j, such that |We2|,|We3|,|Wµ3| agree with the
best-ﬁt values of |Ue2|,|Ue3|,|Uµ3| under the three-ﬂavor hypothesis. As discussed in Sec. III, we
21 and |We2|2. The results of
add Gaussian priors for the solar parameters, identiﬁed here as ∆m2
these ﬁts are depicted in Fig. 4.
In the analysis, we marginalize over all parameters not made
explicit in the ﬁgures.

Fig. 4 reveals that, at least at 99% CL, a lower bound on R−1

ED can be obtained in both the
normal and inverted hierarchy scenarios, while a lower bound on m0 can be set at least at 95% CL
for both mass hierarchies. Additionally, if one were to place an independent bound on diﬀerent
combinations of neutrino masses (from, e.g., precision measurements of beta-decay spectra), a 99%
CL upper bound on R−1

ED (or a lower bound on RED) could be obtained.

Finally, we have veriﬁed that the presence of the LED parameters m0, R−1

ED does not signiﬁcantly
impact the sensitivity with which the standard oscillation parameters are measured (see, e.g.,
Refs. [23, 32] for more details). This includes the CP -odd parameter δ13. We have also checked
that this result does not depend strongly on the input value of δ13.

V. DIFFERENTIATING NEW PHYSICS SCENARIOS

In this section we address the capabilities of DUNE to identify whether there is physics beyond
the three-ﬂavor paradigm and identify the nature of the new physics, assuming new physics is indeed
present. To that eﬀect, in Sec. V A, we ﬁrst simulate data consistent with the LED hypothesis, as
we did in Sec. IV, and try to ﬁt the data with the three-neutrino hypothesis. We then ask whether
it is possible to diﬀerentiate the LED hypothesis from other new physics scenarios. In particular,
we compare the LED hypothesis with that of a fourth neutrino mass eigenstate. In Sec. V B, we
address whether a four-neutrino model can mimic the LED hypothesis, while in Sec. V C we ask
the opposite question: can the LED hypothesis mimic generic four-neutrino models?

A. Three-Neutrino Fit to the LED Scenario

In order to gauge whether DUNE can rule out the standard paradigm, we simulate data assuming
the LED hypothesis is correct, exactly as described in Sec. IV, and attempt to ﬁt the data assuming
the standard, three-neutrino paradigm. The ﬁt is performed for two simulated data sets, consistent
with the normal and inverted hierarchies respectively. In order to gauge the quality of the ﬁt, we
calculate the minimum of the χ2 function, χ2
min, and compare it to the number of degrees of
freedom, dof. We deﬁne an equivalent nσ discrepancy between the data and hypothesis assuming
a χ2 distribution function with dof degrees of freedom. In the ﬁts, we include the Gaussian priors
on |Ue2|2 and ∆m2

21, as discussed in the previous sections (see also [23, 27]).

For the normal hierarchy, the result of the ﬁt is χ2

min/ dof = 210/114, or a 5.3σ discrepancy –
a very poor ﬁt. For the inverted hierarchy, the ﬁt is χ2
min/ dof = 208/114, or a 5.2σ discrepancy
– also a very poor ﬁt. These results are, of course, not surprising. According to Fig. 3, the input
values of R−1
ED and m0 are far inside the region of LED parameter space DUNE can exclude at 95%
CL.

B. Four-Neutrino Fit to the LED Scenario

If data are consistent with the LED hypothesis so the standard paradigm is ruled out, it is not
obvious that DUNE can establish that there are extra dimensions. The LED hypothesis is identical
to a 3+3N active-plus-sterile-neutrinos scenario for large enough N . In fact, we argued in the Sec. II
that, for the values of the parameters of relevance here, N = 1 is already a good approximation to
the LED model. Here, we attempt to ﬁt the simulated LED model to a four-neutrino hypothesis,
using the framework described in Ref. [23].∗ While four neutrinos is less than the six neutrinos
that are known to be a good approximation to the LED hypothesis, there is reason to suspect
that, at DUNE and given the values of m0 and R−1
ED of interest, the four-neutrino hypothesis is also
a good approximation to the LED model. The reason is as follows. At the DUNE baseline and

∗ We denote the six mixing angles in a four-neutrino hypothesis as φij (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, i < j) to emphasize that they
are not equivalent to the θij of a three-neutrino hypothesis. The CP -violating phase η1 is equivalent to δ13, and
the new phases η2 and η3 contribute in the appearance channel in the combination ηs ≡ η2 − η3.

given DUNE neutrino energies, oscillation eﬀects associated to the KK modes average out. The
same eﬀect can be mimicked by a 3+1 scenario in the limit where the new mass-squared diﬀerence
is large. The map between the 3+1 and the LED scenario is not completely straightforward, but
there are enough relevant degrees of freedom in the 3+1 model to accommodate all LED eﬀects
assuming there are no new resolvable mass-squared diﬀerences.†
min (cid:39) dof). The results of these ﬁts,
one for each hierarchy hypothesis, are summarized in Table II. For both hierarchies, the four-
neutrino hypothesis favors ∆m2
41 > 0.1 eV2, the range in which oscillations associated with the
extra neutrino average out for the energies of interest at DUNE. For this reason, we expect little
sensitivity to the new, potentially observable, CP -violating phase ηs ≡ η2 − η3.

For both the NH and IH, we ﬁnd a good ﬁt (i.e., χ2

TABLE II: Results of four-neutrino ﬁts to data generated according to the LED Hypotheses discussed in
Sec. IV. Best-ﬁt values are the result of a 10-dimensional minimization, while quoted 95% CL ranges are
from the marginalized one-dimensional resulting χ2 distributions for each parameter. The star on sin2 φ34
is a reminder that we are not including ντ -appearance information and hence have no sensitivity to sin2 φ34.
For this reason, we ﬁx it to zero. See Ref. [23] for more information.

41 and sin2 φ24 - ∆m2

Fig. 5 displays the result of the ﬁt performed assuming the normal hierarchy in the sin2 φ14
- ∆m2
41 planes. We ﬁnd a qualitatively similar result when performing the
ﬁt assuming the neutrino mass hierarchy is inverted. Note that the data are consistent with
sin2 φ14 = 0 at 68.3% CL, but sin2 φ24 = 0 is excluded at more than 99% CL. On the other hand,
while it is possible to establish that the new oscillation frequency is large (∆m2
41 > 0.1 eV2 at a high
conﬁdence level), it is not possible to place an upper bound on the new mass-squared diﬀerence.

C. LED Fit to Four-Neutrino Scenarios

Here, we generate data assuming four neutrinos exist, and attempt to ﬁt this simulated data
under the LED hypothesis. While it is easy to show that the LED hypothesis, under the cir-
cumstances of interest, can be mimicked by a four-neutrino scenario, the converse is by no means
obvious. In the LED hypothesis, the elements of the (inﬁnitely large) neutrino mixing matrix are
all related and can be uniquely determined once a handful of parameters are ﬁxed, as described in
Sec. II. This means that the LED hypothesis can only perfectly mimic a four-neutrino scenario if

the mixing angles and CP -odd parameters are related in nontrivial ways. In summary, at least at
the oscillation probability level, a generic four-neutrino scenario cannot be mimicked by the LED
hypothesis.

We pursue the issue by perturbing around the best-ﬁt solutions discussed in the previous sub-
section and tabulated in Table II. First, we generate data assuming the four-neutrino parameters
listed in Table II. In this case, for both the normal and inverted hierarchies, we ﬁnd that the LED
min (cid:39) dof) ﬁt, with m0/(RED)−1 (cid:39) 0.13, which is what we expect
hypothesis generates a good (χ2
given the original LED hypothesis we assumed in Sec. IV.

Next, we generate data assuming the four-neutrino parameters listed in Table II but with
41 = 10−2 eV2, a value studied more in-depth in Ref. [23]. For this value of ∆m2
∆m2
41, we expect
the new oscillations due to the fourth neutrino to be relevant for the energies of interest at DUNE. In
this case, for the normal hierarchy, we obtain a ﬁt that has χ2
min/ dof = 349/112, which corresponds
to a discrepancy larger than 8σ – a very poor ﬁt. For the inverted hierarchy, the ﬁt has χ2
min/ dof
= 402/112, corresponding to a larger than 8σ discrepancy – also a very poor ﬁt. In either case,
DUNE would be able to rule out both the three-ﬂavor hypothesis and the LED hypothesis, while
the four-neutrino hypothesis would provide an excellent ﬁt to the data.

We repeat the exercise, this time assuming the input values of all the four-neutrino parameters
are those listed in Table II, except for the new mixing angles. If the input values of sin2 φ14 and
sin2 φ24 are 0.1 and 0.01, respectively, the LED hypothesis also fails to ﬁt the 3+1 scenario, for
either mass hierarchy: χ2
min/ dof = 241/112 (6.7σ) for the
IH. In summary, at DUNE, the LED hypothesis can always be mimicked by the 3+1 scenario, but
the converse is, by no means, generically true.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The long-baseline Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [32] has been proposed
to address several outstanding issues in neutrino physics, including the search for new sources of
CP -invariance violation and precision tests of the validity of the standard three-massive-neutrinos
paradigm. In this work, we addressed the ability of DUNE to probe large-extra-dimension (LED)
models. These are scenarios where the smallness of neutrino masses is, at least partially, attributed
to the existence of one extra compactiﬁed dimension of space which is accessible to the right-handed
neutrino ﬁelds but inaccessible to all ﬁelds charged under the standard model gauge group. From
a four-dimensional point of view, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) expansion of the right-handed neutrinos
translates into towers of massive sterile neutrino states, with masses inversely proportional to the
size RED of the extra dimension.

We discussed in some detail the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations at long-baseline experi-
ments in a ﬁve-dimensional LED model. We argued that the LED model, for all practical purposes,
maps into a 3 + 3N -neutrino scenario, and that modest values of N , N = 1 or N = 2 capture the
details of the LED eﬀects at long-baseline oscillations experiments. Nonetheless, we emphasized
that the LED model does not map into a generic 3 + 3N model. Instead, the number of new inde-
pendent mixing parameters is small – six, including four that can be interpreted, to leading order,
as the familiar three-neutrino mixing parameters θ12, θ23, θ13, δ13. Furthermore, we highlighted the
fact that in LED models, there are no new CP -invariance violting parameters; the only source is
the CP -odd phase δ13, which, to zeroth order, plays the same role in the three-neutrino scenario.
We investigated the sensitivity of DUNE to the LED framework. Assuming future DUNE data
are consistent with the three-neutrino paradigm (assuming three and three years of operation in
neutrino and antineutrino modes, respectively), the LED paradigm can be excluded at 95% CL
if R−1
ED ≤ 0.48 eV) assuming a normal (inverted) hierarchy for the mostly active
neutrinos. More stringent limits are obtained if m0, related to the mass of the mostly active states,
turns out to be large (m0 (cid:38) 0.01 eV). The reach of DUNE is compared to that of existing and
future probes in Fig. 3.
We also investigated whether DUNE can measure the new physics parameters if its data turn
out to be consistent with the LED model. We found that there are values of m0 and R−1
ED for which
DUNE can establish, at least at the 68% CL, that m0 is not zero and that the extra-dimension has
a ﬁnite size. One concrete example is depicted in Fig. 4.

ED ≤ 0.54 eV (R−1

Finally, we explored whether, assuming DUNE data are inconsistent with the three-neutrino
paradigm, whether they can reveal the nature of the new physics. We found that data consistent
with LED models are inconsistent with the three-neutrino model if the new physics eﬀects are
strong enough. Nonetheless, we also found that, as far as DUNE is concerned, there are four-
neutrino scenarios which mimic the LED model very eﬀectively. We showed, however, that the
converse is not true. If DUNE data are consistent with a four-neutrino scenario, it is likely that
the data cannot be explained by an LED scenario. In a nutshell, the LED model, in spite of the
fact that it contains an inﬁnite number of new neutrino states, has fewer relevant free parameters
than a generic four-neutrino model.
The key distinguishing features of LED models are the existence of several sterile neutrinos
with hierarchical masses (the new masses are, roughly, R−1
ED, . . .) and strongly corre-
lated elements of the inﬁnite mixing matrix (α4 elements proportional to α1 elements, α5 elements
proportional to α2 elements, etc, for all α = e, µ, τ ). Both are very diﬃcult to establish experimen-
tally in long-baseline experiments because, in those experiments, the eﬀects of the new oscillation
frequencies average out. On the other hand, once new physics eﬀects in νµ disappearance and
νµ → νe appearance are established, the LED hypothesis translates into very concrete predictions
for all other oscillation channels, including νµ → ντ appearance. This is not the case of a generic

3 + 1-scenario, where the new-physics eﬀects in the ντ -appearance channel cannot be constrained
by precision measurements of νµ-disappearance and νe-appearance.
