ℓ be the semisimpliﬁcation of Vℓ, V ab

ℓ , and Gℓ the algebraic monodromy group of V ss

Abstract. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system of Galois representations
arising from geometry. Let V ss
the maximal abelian
subrepresentation of V ss
ℓ . Conjecturally, the
abelian part {V ab
ℓ }ℓ is again a strictly compatible rational system (Conj. Ab). This conjec-
ture has meaningful consequences to arithmetic geometry, for example, the Tate conjecture
is independent of ℓ if Conj. Ab and the semisimplicity conjecture of Grothendieck hold.
The main theme of this paper is to investigate Conj. Ab via ℓ-independence of Gℓ. More
precisely, we prove that Conj. Ab follows if (i) Gℓ is connected for all ℓ, (ii) the tautological
representation of the complex semisimple Lie group Gder
(C) is independent of ℓ, and (iii)
the roots of Gder
(C) meet a criterion (Thm. 1.1). These conditions are satisﬁed under some
group theoretic assumptions on Gℓ (Thm. 1.3), for example, (ii) and (iii) hold if Gder
(C) is
connected and semisimple of type A4 × A6 × A6 for some ℓ; (iii) holds if Gder
(C) is almost
simple of type diﬀerent from A7, A8, B4, D8.

ABELIAN PART OF COMPATIBLE SYSTEM AND GEOMETRY OF ROOTS

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation. Fix a number ﬁeld K and an embedding ¯Qℓ′ ֒→ C. The Langlands reci-
procity conjecture [Lan79, §2] predicts a one-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism
classes of irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations π of GLn(AK) and the isomor-
phism classes of n-dimensional irreducible ¯Qℓ′-representations ¯Wℓ′ of Gal( ¯K/K) arising from
geometry, which preserves the local L-factors at almost all primes p: if π corresponds to ¯Wℓ′,
then Lp(π, p−s) = Lp( ¯Wℓ′ ⊗ C, p−s). Arising from geometry here means that ¯Wℓ′ is iso-
morphic to a subquotient of Lm
j=1 H ij ( ¯Xj, ¯Qℓ′(rj)), where Xj is smooth projective over K,
¯Xj := Xj × ¯K, m ∈ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, and ij, rj ∈ Z. For the complete description of the
one-to-one correspondence, see [Cl90, §4],[Tay04, Conj. 1.1, 3.4, 3.5].
Let π ↔ ¯Wℓ′ be a correspondence arising from the Langlands reciprocity conjecture as
above. Since the automorphic side of the conjecture is independent of ℓ, one obtains a
correspondence π ↔ ¯Wℓ for every prime ℓ by the conjecture at ℓ and thus a system of
¯Qℓ-representations { ¯Wℓ}ℓ of Gal( ¯K/K). Since every ¯Wℓ arises from geometry and the local
L-factors are preserved, the system { ¯Wℓ}ℓ satisﬁes weak compatibility in the following sense:
Deﬁnition 1. Let ρι : Gal( ¯K/K) → GLn(Fι) be a Galois representation over a characteristic
zero ﬁeld Fι for every ι belonging to an index set I. The system {ρι}ι is said to be weakly
compatible if there exists an embedding Fι ֒→ C for every ι such that:
(i) for each ι, ρι is unramiﬁed at almost all ﬁnite places v of K;
(ii) for every pair ι, ι′ of indices, the characteristic polynomials Pv,ρι(t), Pv,ρι′ (t) of the

Frobenii above v agree in C[t] via Fι ֒→ C ←֓ Fι′ for almost all ﬁnite places v.

Let X be smooth projective over K. The Galois representation H i( ¯X, Qℓ) is conjectured to
be semisimple (Grothendieck). Deligne has proven that the system of ℓ-adic representations
{Vℓ = H i( ¯X, Qℓ)}ℓ is strictly compatible rational (see §2.2) [De74]. The semisimplicity
conjecture, the conjectural correspondence of Langlands, and the compatibility condition
lead us to the following conjecture on the decomposition of the strictly compatible rational
system {Vℓ}ℓ arising from geometry (meaning that {Vℓ}ℓ is a strictly compatible rational
system and Vℓ ⊗ ¯Qℓ arises from geometry for all ℓ).
Conjecture De. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system arising from geometry.
Then there exist weakly compatible systems of ¯Qℓ-representations { ¯W (k)
ℓ }ℓ for 1 ≤ k ≤ m
such that for all ℓ, Vℓ admits the following decomposition:

Vℓ ⊗ ¯Qℓ ∼= ¯W (1)

ℓ ⊕ ¯W (2)

ℓ ⊕ · · · ⊕ ¯W (m)

.

ℓ

Since the Langlands reciprocity conjecture is wide open1, Conjecture De in general is out
of reach, especially when the irreducibles of Vℓ ⊗ ¯Qℓ are not all of dimension one or two.
However, the next conjecture, which follows from the above one, is the motivation of this
paper.
Conjecture Ab. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system arising from geometry,
with the exceptional set S. Denote by V ab
the maximal abelian subrepresentation of the

ℓ of Vℓ. Then the abelian part {V ab

ℓ }ℓ is also strictly compatible rational

By Conjecture Ab, the abelian part {V ab

ℓ }ℓ is associated to some Q-representation of some

Serre group Sm (see §2.2). Conjecture Ab has the following meaningful consequences.
(i) Motives and new compatible systems. Let V c

believed that {V ss

ℓ }ℓ is also strictly compatible rational. Hence, one should
ℓ }ℓ and {V c
ℓ }ℓ and study them separately. Actually, it is

ℓ . Then {V c
ℓ }ℓ into {V ab
ℓ }ℓ is the realization of a pure motive M [Kl72] and the equation

ℓ

{V ab

ℓ }ℓ ⊕ {V c

ℓ }ℓ = {V ss
ℓ }ℓ

corresponds to a decomposition of M. Let {Vℓ}ℓ, {Wℓ}ℓ, {Uℓ}ℓ, ... be strictly compatible
rational systems arising from geometry. Then any tensor construction of them is still
strictly compatible rational arising from geometry. Therefore, one produces new strictly
compatible rational systems by Conjecture Ab, e.g., {(Vℓ⊗Wℓ)?}ℓ, {(Sym3Vℓ)?}ℓ, where
? ∈ {ab, c}.

(ii) Factorization of L-function. Let ρ := {ρℓ

: Gal( ¯K/K) → GL(Vℓ)}ℓ be a strictly
compatible rational system arising from geometry and S the exceptional subset of ﬁnite
places of K for ρ. Denote by Pv,ρ(t) := det(1 − ρℓ(Frob¯v)t) ∈ Q[t] the characteristic
polynomial (independent of ℓ, ¯v) of the Frobenius element at ¯v on Vℓ whenever ¯v is a
place of ¯K extending v of K, v /∈ S, and v ∤ ℓ. The L-function of ρ (depends on S) is
deﬁned [Se98, Ch. I §2.5] to be

L(ρ, s) :=Yv /∈S

1

Pv,ρ((Nv)−s)

,

where Nv ∈ N is the norm of v. The L-function L(ρ, s) converges in some right half
plane Re(s) > C. Denote by ρss the semisimpliﬁcation of the system ρ and by ρab and
ρc the abelian and complementary subsystems of ρss. Since L(ρ, s) = L(ρss, s) and ρab
and ρc are strictly compatible rational with the exceptional set S by Conjecture Ab,
we obtain a factorization

L(ρ, s) = L(ρab, s)L(ρc, s).

Since ρab arises from CM motives (Deligne’s absolute Hodge cycles) [DMOS82],[FM93,
§6 Prop.], [Sc94], L(ρab, s) has meromorphic continuation to the complex plane.

(iii) ℓ-independence of the Tate conjecture. Let X be a smooth projective variety deﬁned over
K, gℓ the Lie algebra of the image of Gal( ¯K/K) in GL(H 2r( ¯X, Qℓ(r))), and CH r( ¯X)
the Chow group of codimension r cycles of ¯X. The Tate conjecture [Ta65] asserts that
the image of the cycle map

cℓ : CH r( ¯X) → H 2r( ¯X, Qℓ(r))

1.2. Results. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system (§2.2) of ℓ-adic (Qℓ-) rep-
resentations of Gal( ¯K/K) arising from geometry (§1.1). The semisimpliﬁcation of Vℓ is
represented by

ϕℓ : Gal( ¯K/K) → GL(V ss

ℓ ) ∼= GLN (Qℓ)

for all ℓ. The algebraic monodromy group of V ss
ℓ , denoted by Gℓ, is deﬁned as the Zariski clo-
sure of the Galois image ϕℓ(Gal( ¯K/K)) in the Qℓ-algebraic group GLV ss
. Since ϕℓ is semisim-
ple, we identify Gℓ as a reductive subgroup of GLN,Qℓ for all ℓ. The tautological representa-
tion G◦
ℓ ֒→ GLN,Qℓ is conjectured to be independent of ℓ [Se94]. For results on ℓ-independence
of monodromy group of compatible system, see [Se72, Se85],[Ri76],[Chi92],[Pi98],[LP95] for
abelian varieties and [LP92],[Chin04],[Hui13, Hui15a, Hui15b] for more general case.

(see §2.1). Thus, one can take a ﬁnite extension of K for 1.1(i) to hold. Condition 1.1(ii)
implies that 1.1(iii) is independent of ℓ.

The ℓ-independence condition 1.1(ii) and the roots criterion 1.1 (iii) can be checked in spe-
ciﬁc cases. However, they are always satisﬁed under Hypothesis A [Hui15b, §3] (see 1.3(ii)).
Together with a determination of almost simple Lie groups satisfying these conditions, we
obtain the next result.
Theorem 1.3. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system arising from geometry, with
the exceptional set S. Let Gℓ be the algebraic monodromy group of V ss
for all ℓ. Suppose (i)
ℓ
Gℓ is connected for all ℓ and one of the following conditions hold:

(ii) Hypothesis A: there exists some ℓ′ such that Gder

Then the abelian part {V ab

assumptions in Theorem 1.1 or 1.3.

Under Hypothesis A, one can prove the following for Conjecture De.

Qℓ. Then the local representations of Wℓ above ℓ are of Hodge-Tate type.

Theorem 1.5. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a strictly compatible rational system arising from geometry. Let
Gℓ be the algebraic monodromy group of V ss
for all ℓ. Suppose (i) Gℓ is connected for all ℓ
and (ii) Hypothesis A is satisﬁed. Let Lm ¯Wℓ′ be a ¯Qℓ′-subrepresentation of V ss

some ℓ′ and { ¯Wℓ}ℓ a weakly compatible system of irreducible ¯Qℓ-representations satisfying
the following conditions:

(iv) for all ℓ, descend ¯Wℓ to an Eℓ-representation Wℓ in which Eℓ is a ﬁnite extension of
Then {Lm ¯Wℓ}ℓ is a subsystem of {V ss
1.3. Outline. The idea behind Theorems 1.1 and 1.5 is that an irreducible representation
¯Wℓ′ is a subrepresentation of a semisimple ¯Vℓ′ (denoted by ¯Wℓ′ ≤ ¯Vℓ′) if and only if ¯Vℓ′⊗ ¯W ∗
ℓ′ =
Hom( ¯Wℓ′, ¯Vℓ′) has non-trivial invariants; to do the same thing for a family { ¯Wℓ, ¯Vℓ}ℓ assuming
¯Wℓ′ ≤ ¯Vℓ′ for some ℓ′, it suﬃces to show that the tautological representation ¯Vℓ ⊗ ¯W ∗
ℓ of its
algebraic monodromy group Hℓ is independent of ℓ. Section 2 is devoted to the proofs of
Theorems 1.1, (part of) 1.3, 1.5, which rely on the ideas we have developed in [Hui13, Hui15b].
The criterion on the roots R (1.1(iii)) ensures the desired ℓ-independence of the tautological
representations of Hℓ. Section 3 is devoted to the study of the criterion on R by a geometric
conﬁguration of R ⊂ Γ ⊗ R. The results will complete the proof of Theorem 1.3.

2. Abelian part of compatible system

2.1. Frobenius tori. Let Eℓ be a ﬁnite extension of Qℓ and ﬁx an embedding Eℓ ֒→ C for all
ℓ. Let {Vℓ}ℓ be a weakly compatible (Deﬁnition 1) system of semisimple Eℓ-representations:
(1)

ψℓ : Gal( ¯K/K) → GL(Vℓ), ∀ℓ.

The algebraic monodromy group Gℓ of Vℓ is reductive. The method of Frobenius tori, pio-
neered by Serre, is foundational to the study of ℓ-independence of Gℓ. Denote by v a ﬁnite

6

ABELIAN PART OF COMPATIBLE SYSTEM AND GEOMETRY OF ROOTS

place of K and ¯v a place of ¯K dividing v. Let ψℓ(Frob¯v) be the image of the Frobenius at ¯v
whenever ψℓ is unramiﬁed at v.

Deﬁnition 2. The Frobenius torus T¯v,ℓ is deﬁned as the identity component of the smallest
algebraic subgroup of Gℓ containing the semisimple part of ψℓ(Frob¯v).

Theorem 2.1. (Serre [Se81]) (see also [Chi92, Theorem 3.7],[LP97, Theorem 1.2]) Fix a
prime ℓ′ and suppose Gℓ′ is connected. Denote by pv the characteristic of v and by qv the
cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of v. Suppose the eigenvalues α of ψℓ′(Frob¯v) are algebraic for
almost all v and the following conditions hold:

(i) the absolute values of α in all complex embeddings are equal;
(ii) α is a unit at any ﬁnite place not above pv;
(iii) for any non-Archimedean valuation w of ¯Q such that w(pv) > 0, the ratio w(α)/w(qv)

belongs to a ﬁnite subset of Q that is independent of ¯v.

Then there exists a proper closed subvariety Y of Gℓ′ such that T¯v,ℓ′ is a maximal torus of
Gℓ′ whenever ψℓ′(Frob¯v) ∈ Gℓ′\Y.

The following consequences are well-known.

Corollary 2.2. Suppose the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1 hold. Then Gℓ is connected for all
ℓ.

Proof. By the Chebotarev density theorem, Gℓ is the Zariski closure of the image of the
Frobenii ψℓ(Frob¯v) for a density 1 subset S of places v. Moreover, we can choose S such
that T¯v,ℓ′ is a maximal torus of Gℓ′ for all v ∈ S by Theorem 2.1. Since Gℓ′ is connected
reductive, the smallest algebraic subgroup of Gℓ′ containing ψℓ′(Frob¯v) is connected if T¯v,ℓ′
is a maximal torus. Hence, Gℓ is generated by the Frobenius tori T¯v,ℓ (for all v ∈ S) by the
weak compatibility. We conclude that Gℓ is connected for all ℓ.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3. Suppose the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1 hold. Let Tℓ,C be a maximal torus
of Gℓ(C). Then the tautological representation of Tℓ,C is independent of ℓ. In particular, the
rank of Gℓ is independent of ℓ.

Proof. For any ℓ, ℓ′, we can ﬁnd some ¯v such that both T¯v,ℓ and T¯v,ℓ′ are maximal Frobenius
tori of Gℓ and Gℓ′ respectively by Corollary 2.2 and Theorem 2.1. By weak compatibility,
the tautological representations of T¯v,ℓ(C) and T¯v,ℓ′(C) are isomorphic. Since all maximal
tori of a connected reductive group (over algebraically closed ﬁeld) are conjugate, we are
done.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.4. [De80],[Se81] (see also [LP97]) The conditions on Frobenius eigenvalues
of Theorem 2.1 always hold for Eℓ-representations arising from geometry.

2.2. Locally algebraic abelian representations. This subsection describes the essence
of [Se98, Ch. II, III]. Let Art : IK → Gal( ¯K/K)ab be the Artin map and i : (K⊗Q Qℓ)∗ ֒→ IK
the embedding. Let Eℓ be a ﬁnite extension of Qℓ and T := ResK/QGm the Q-torus given
by the Weil restriction of scalars. For any Q-algebra A, we have the group isomorphism
T(A) ∼= (K ⊗Q A)∗.

Deﬁnition 3. [Se98, Ch. III §2] A continuous abelian Eℓ-representation ρℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab →
GLn(Eℓ) is said to be locally algebraic if there exists an Eℓ-morphism r : T ×Q Eℓ → GLn,Eℓ
such that

(2)
for all x ∈ (K ⊗Q Qℓ)∗ close enough to the identity (ℓ-adic topology), where we identify
(K ⊗Q Qℓ)∗ ⊂ (K ⊗Q Eℓ)∗ = T(Eℓ).

ρℓ ◦ Art ◦ i(x) = r(x−1)

Local algebraicity of ρℓ depends only on the local representations of ρℓ above ℓ, i.e., the
restrictions of ρℓ to the decomposition groups of Gal( ¯K/K) at the places of ¯K above ℓ. This
property is invariant under ﬁeld extensions of Eℓ (obviously) as well as the restriction of
scalars.
Proposition 2.5. (see [Ri76, §5]) A continuous abelian Eℓ-representation ρℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab →
GLn(Eℓ) is locally algebraic if and only if it is locally algebraic when viewed as a Qℓ-
representation.

Let S be a ﬁnite subset of ﬁnite places of K. For any modulus m = (mv)v∈S (mv ∈ N)
with support Supp(m) = S, Serre has constructed [Se98, Ch. II] the Serre group Sm and an
abelian rational representation with values in Sm for each ℓ:
ǫℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab → Sm(Qℓ).

The Serre group Sm is a diagonalizable group over Q satisfying the short exact sequence

Sm.

Proposition 2.6. [Se98, Ch. II §2] We list some properties of ǫℓ and Sm.
(i) The representation ǫℓ is unramiﬁed outside S and Sℓ, the places v of K above ℓ.
(ii) The image of the Frobenii above v belong to Sm(Q) for all v /∈ S ∪ Sℓ and is dense in
(iii) The representations of Sm are always semisimple.
(iv) The ﬁnite group Cm is the Galois group of the class ﬁeld of K corresponding to m.
(v) The dimension dK of Sm depends only on K, not on m.
Deﬁnition 4. [Se98, Ch. II §2] A continuous abelian Eℓ-representation ρℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab →
GLn(Eℓ) is said to be associated to some Serre group Sm if there exists an Eℓ-morphism
ηℓ : Sm,Eℓ → GLn,Eℓ such that

representation and E a number ﬁeld contained in Eℓ. Then ϕℓ is said to be E-rational
if ϕℓ is unramiﬁed outside a ﬁnite subset S of ﬁnite places v of K and the characteristic
polynomial Pv,ϕℓ(t) of the Frobenii above v belongs to E[t] for all v outside S. The term
Q-rational is abbreviated as rational.

I §2] Let ϕℓ

For any ﬁnite place v of a number ﬁeld, let pv be the characteristic of v. For any number
ﬁeld E with a ﬁnite place λ, let Eλ be the completion of E with respect to λ. An Eλ-
representation is also called a λ-adic representation.

Deﬁnition 6. [Se98, Ch. I §2] For each ﬁnite place λ of E, let ϕλ be an E-rational λ-adic
representation of Gal( ¯K/K). The system {ϕλ}λ is said to be strictly compatible if there
exists a ﬁnite subset S of ﬁnite places v of K, called the exceptional set of {ϕλ}λ, such that:
(i) let Sλ = {v : pv = pλ}, then ρλ is unramiﬁed if v /∈ S ∪ Sλ.
(ii) Pv,ϕλ(t) = Pv,ϕλ′ (t) if v /∈ S ∪ Sλ ∪ Sλ′.
Theorem 2.8. [Se98, Ch. II §3.4] If a continuous abelian Eℓ-representation ρℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab →
GLn(Eℓ) is associated to some Serre group Sm, then ρℓ is semisimple and E-rational for some
subﬁeld E of the Galois closure of K and the |Cm|th roots of unity in ¯Q, where the ﬁnite
group Cm is deﬁned in (4).
Corollary 2.9. If a continuous abelian Eℓ′-representation ρℓ′ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab → GLn(Eℓ′) is
associated to some Serre group Sm, then there exist a strictly compatible E-rational system
{ρλ}λ of semisimple abelian λ-adic representations with the exceptional set Supp(m) and a
local ﬁeld isometry Eλ′ ∼= Eℓ′ for some λ′ such that
ρℓ′ = ρλ′.
(6)

Proof. By Theorem 2.8 and [Se98, Ch. II §2.4], ηℓ′ (in Deﬁnition 4) is the base change to
Eℓ′ of an E-morphism η : Sm,E → GLn,E and we may assume the number ﬁeld E is dense
in Eℓ′. Then η induces the desired system of λ-adic representations (see e.g. [Se98, Ch. II
Thm. 1]). Pick λ′ such that Eλ′ is isometric to Eℓ′, we obtain ρℓ′ = ρλ′.
(cid:3)

The following converse of Theorem 2.8 (in light of Theorem 2.7) follows from the arguments
of Serre in [Se98, Ch. III §3] and a result of transcendental numbers by Waldschmidt [Wa81].
Theorem 2.10. (see e.g. [He80, Thm. 2]) If a continuous semisimple abelian Eℓ-representation
ρℓ : Gal( ¯K/K)ab → GLn(Eℓ) is E-rational, then ρℓ is locally algebraic.
Deﬁnition 7. [Se67, §2] Let L be a ﬁnite extension of Qℓ and BHT :=Li∈Z Cℓ(i) the period
ring, where the Gal( ¯L/L)-module Cℓ(i) is the twist of Cℓ (the completion of ¯L) by the ith
power of the cyclotomic character. A continuous Eℓ-representation ϕℓ : Gal( ¯L/L) → GL(Vℓ)
is said to be of Hodge-Tate type if the natural Gal( ¯L/L)-inclusion
BHT ⊗Qℓ (BHT ⊗Qℓ Vℓ)Gal( ¯L/L) → BHT ⊗Qℓ Vℓ

(7)

is an isomorphism.

Remark 2.11. The Eℓ-representation Vℓ is viewed as a Qℓ-representation in (7).

Then the formal bi-character of Gℓ(C) ֒→ GLn(C) is independent of ℓ.
Remark 2.14. In case {ψℓ}ℓ is only a strictly compatible rational system of Qℓ-representations
without the three conditions, Theorem 2.13 follows from [Hui13, Thm. 3.19]. The added con-
ditions allow us to streamline the proof of [Hui13, Thm. 3.19], in which we follow closely for
Theorem 2.13.

ℓ

Proof. Identify Gℓ as a connected reductive subgroup of GLn,Eℓ by (i) and the semisimplicity.
Then the derived group Gder
is semisimple. Let η : Sm → GLm,Q be a faithful representation
and form a strictly compatible system of semisimple abelian Eℓ-representations {ρℓ := ηℓ◦ǫℓ}ℓ
(Deﬁnition 4). Then {ρℓ}ℓ satisﬁes (ii) by [Se98, Ch. II §3.4 Prop. 2] and (iii) by the diagram
(9), so does the weakly compatible system {ψℓ⊕ρℓ}ℓ. Since ψℓ⊕ρℓ is semisimple, the algebraic
monodromy group Hℓ is reductive. Since ρℓ is abelian, the derived group Hder
ℓ of Hℓ is exactly
equal to Gder
ℓ × {1} ⊂ GLn,Eℓ × GLm,Eℓ). Since Hℓ is reductive, there exist k ∈ N
and a subrepresentation Wℓ of (ψℓ ⊕ ρℓ)⊗k = (En+m
(11)

)⊗k such that

(or Gder

ℓ

ℓ

Gder
ℓ = ker(Hℓ → GLWℓ)◦.

Since Wℓ is abelian semisimple and its local representations above ℓ are of Hodge-Tate type
by construction, Wℓ is associated to some Serre group by the diagram (9), which implies that
the center Z(H◦

ℓ ) of the identity component H◦

ℓ satisﬁes the inequality

(12)
Since the projection of Hℓ ⊂ GLn,Eℓ × GLm,Eℓ to the second factor is Sm,Eℓ by Proposition
2.6(ii), we conclude with (12) that

ℓ ) ≤ dim Sm,Eℓ

=: dK.

dim Z(H◦

2.6(v)

(13)

dim Z(H◦

ℓ ) = dK.

Since {ψℓ ⊕ ρℓ}ℓ satisﬁes (ii) (the Frobenius eigenvalues conditions), the restriction {(ψℓ ⊕
ρℓ)|Gal( ¯K/L)}ℓ satisﬁes (ii) and weak compatibility for any ﬁnite extension L of K. By Corol-
lary 2.2, we can ﬁnd some ﬁnite extension L such that the algebraic monodromy group of
(ψℓ ⊕ ρℓ)|Gal( ¯K/L) is the identity component H◦
ℓ for all ℓ. By applying Corollary 2.3 to the
system {(ψℓ ⊕ ρℓ)|Gal( ¯K/L)}ℓ, we obtain a maximal torus Tℓ,C (Frobenius torus) of the con-
nected reductive Lie group H◦
ℓ (C), in which the construction implies that the tautological
representation

(14)
is independent of ℓ, i.e., for all ℓ′, ℓ′′, Tℓ′,C and Tℓ′′,C are conjugate in GLn(C) × GLm(C). If
we let π1 (resp. π2) be the projection of GLn(C)× GLm(C) to the ﬁrst (resp. second) factor,
then the ℓ-independence of (14) implies the tautological representation

Tℓ,C ֒→ GLn(C) × GLm(C)

(15)

is independent of ℓ.

π1(ker(π2|Tℓ,C)◦) ⊂ π1(Tℓ,C) ֒→ GLn(C)

Since π1(Hℓ) = Gℓ, π1(Tℓ,C) is a maximal torus of Gℓ(C). Since we have π2(Hℓ) = Sm,Eℓ

and (13), we deduce that

(16)

ker(π2 : Hℓ → GLm,Eℓ)◦ = Hder

ℓ = Gder

ℓ × {1}.

Hence, π1(ker(π2|Tℓ,C)◦) is a maximal torus of Gder

by Faltings [Fa88]. Our conditions (i),(ii),(iii) are just 2.17(i),(iv),(v). Hence, dim V ab

the isomorphism classes Xℓ′ of the characters of V ab
ℓ′ ⊗Qℓ′ Eℓ′. For any Wℓ′ ∈ Xℓ′, Wℓ′
is unramiﬁed outside S ∪ Sℓ′ (Deﬁnition 6(i)). Since Wℓ′ arises from geometry, its local
representations above ℓ′ are of Hodge-Tate type [Fa88]. By the diagram (9) and Theorem
2.7(ii), Wℓ′ is associated to some Serre group Sm with Supp(m) = S ∪ Sℓ′. Since Xℓ′ is ﬁnite,
there exists a number ﬁeld E dense in Eℓ′ such that for every Wℓ′ ∈ Xℓ′, Wℓ′ extends to a
strictly compatible E-rational system of semisimple abelian λ-adic representations {Wλ}λ
with the exceptional set S ∪ Sℓ′ by the diagram (9). Suppose {W1,λ}λ,{W2,λ}λ are the λ-adic

3. Geometry of roots

Let GC be a connected semisimple complex Lie subgroup of GLN (C) and TC a maximal
torus of GC. Denote by Γ the character group of TC and by R ⊂ Γ the roots of GC with
respect to TC. Let f : GC ֒→ GLN (C) be the tautological representation. Then the normal-
izer NGLN (C)(TC) acts on Γ. We are interested in the following question:

Q: For what pair (GC, f ) is R stable under NGLN (C)(TC)?

Theorem 3.1 (a consequence of Theorem 2.19) below answers Q for some type A semisimple
GC. The goal of this section is to study Q under the assumption that GC is almost simple
(Theorem 3.2), i.e., the Lie algebra g of GC is a complex simple Lie algebra. In the Cartan-
Killing classiﬁcation, g is one of An (n ≥ 1), Bn (n ≥ 2), Cn (n ≥ 3), Dn (n ≥ 4), E6, E7,
E8, F4, and G2.

Theorem 3.1. Let GC be a connected semisimple complex Lie group satisfying the Lie type
conditions in Hypothesis A, i.e.,

• GC has at most one factor of type A4;
• if HC is an almost simple factor of GC, then HC is of type An for some n ∈

N\{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}.

Then R is stable under NGLN (C)(TC) for all embedding f of GC.

ABELIAN PART OF COMPATIBLE SYSTEM AND GEOMETRY OF ROOTS

Theorem 3.2. Let GC be a connected almost simple complex Lie group.

(i) If the type of GC is diﬀerent from A7, A8, B4, D8, then R is stable under NGLN (C)(TC)

for all embeddings f of GC.

(ii) For all g ∈ {A7, A8, B4, D8}, there exists a pair (GC, f ) such that GC is of type g and

R is not stable under NGLN (C)(TC).

3.1. A geometric viewpoint. We introduce a geometric viewpoint on the conﬁguration of
R in Γ⊗Z R that we learned from [LP90, §1] and developed in [Hui13, §2]. This viewpoint is
also the starting point of Theorem 2.19, see [Hui13, §2],[Hui15b, §3]. Let Γ be the character
group of the maximal torus TC, Z[Γ] the group ring, and R (resp. W ) the roots (resp. the
Weyl group) of the connected complex semisimple GC with respect to TC. Then the formal
character TC ֒→ GLN (C) of f : GC ֒→ GLN (C) (Deﬁnition 8) is equivalent to the element
(25)

Char(f ) := α1 + · · · + αN ∈ Z[Γ],

where α1, ..., αN are the multiset of the weights of f with respect to TC. Consider the R-
vector space Γ ⊗Z R. The formal character deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite inner product ( , ) on
the dual space (Γ ⊗Z R)∗ by
(26)

(x∗

1, x∗

2) =

αi(x∗

1)αi(x∗

2).

NXi=1

This non-degenerate pairing induces an isomorphism Γ ⊗Z R → (Γ ⊗Z R)∗ mapping x to x∗.
Then we obtain a positive deﬁnite inner product h , i on Γ⊗Z R such that hx1, x2i = (x∗
1, x∗
2)
for all x1, x2 ∈ Γ ⊗Z R. Since the normalizer NC := NGLN (C)(TC) ﬁxes Char(f ), NC is
isometric on the metric space Γ⊗Z R induced by h , i. Since the Weyl group W is a subgroup
of NC, we conclude that W is isometric on Γ ⊗Z R.
Consider the set of almost simple factors of GC: Hj,C for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. Then Tj,C :=
(TC ∩ Hj,C)◦ is a maximal torus of Hj,C. Let Γj be the character group of Tj,C and Rj (resp.
Wj) the roots (resp. Weyl group) of Hj,C with respect to the maximal torus Tj,C. Since Rj
spans Γj ⊗Z R, the disjoint union R =`m
Γ ⊗Z R =

j=1 Rj induces a direct sum decomposition:

Γj ⊗Z R.

(27)

Suppose G′

As W ∼=Qm
j=1 Wj is isometric on Γ ⊗Z R and preserves Γj ⊗Z R for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m, (27) is an
orthogonal direct sum. This implies by [Bo81, VI §1 Prop. 5 Cor. (i)] that for 1 ≤ j ≤ m,
(28)

h , i|Γj ⊗ZR is a positive multiple of the Killing form [FH91, §14] on Γj ⊗Z R.

C is another connected complex semisimple Lie subgroup of GLN (C) sharing
the same maximal torus TC with GC. Let R′ be the roots of G′
C with respect to TC. Then
R′ ⊂ Γ ⊂ Γ ⊗Z R. There is a strong geometric connection between R and R′. Let r ∈ R,
r′ ∈ R′, and θ the angle between them. Since r′ and r are characters of TC, we obtain
(29)

mMj=1

by (28). This implies 4 cos2 θ ∈ Z and θ can only be a multiple of 30◦ or 45◦ (see [Hui13, §2]).

Example: Notation as above. The semisimple Lie
group GC = SL2(C) × SL2(C)/ ± (−Id,−Id) is a sub-
group of the simple exceptional Lie group G′
C of type
G2 and f is the restriction to GC of the adjoint rep-
resentation Ad : G′
C ֒→ GLN (C). Since TC is also a
maximal torus of G′
C, the conﬁguration of the nonzero
weights of f on Γ⊗Z R with respect to h , i is just some
positive multiple of the root system of G2 (the ﬁgure).
As f contains the adjoint representation of GC as a
subrepresentation, the roots R = R1` R2 of GC must
appear in the ﬁgure. Since (27) is an orthogonal sum,
R1 and R2 are perpendicular. Without loss of general-
ity, assume R1 = {e1,−e1} and R2 = {e2,−e2}. Then
we obtain ||e2|| = √3||e1||. On the other hand, we see
that the angles between R (red) and R′ (red or blue)
are multiples of 30◦.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 3.2. The notation in §3.1 remains in force. There is a lattice Λ of
Γ ⊗Z R containing Γ, known as the weight lattice. The construction is as follows. Let fGC
be the universal covering of GC, fTC a maximal torus of fGC mapping onto TC, and Λ the
character group of fTC. Then the character group Γ of TC injects into Λ as a ﬁnite index
subgroup. Hence, Λ⊗Z R can be identiﬁed as Γ⊗Z R. Suppose GC is simple and let g ∈ NC.
C the subgroup gGCg−1 in GLN (C). Then GC
Then g is orthogonal on Λ⊗Z R. Denote by G′
and G′
C share the common maximal torus TC and R′ = gR. We ﬁrst prove that R = R′ in Λ
if the Lie algebra g of GC is not equal to A7, A8, B4, D8 (Theorem 3.2(i)). The conﬁguration
R ⊂ Λ ⊂ Λ ⊗Z R, up to normalization, is the same as the conﬁguration of the root system
of the complex simple Lie algebra g [GOV94, Table 1].

3.2.1. g = An. Let r ∈ R, r′ ∈ R′, and θ the angle between them. Since R′ = gR, we obtain
||r|| = ||r′||. Thus, θ is a multiple of 60◦ or 90◦ (2 cos θ ∈ Z by (29)). We follow the crucial
computation in [Hui13, Prop. 2.8]. Normalize Λ ⊗Z R such that ||r|| = √2. There exist
weights e1, ..., en, en+1 ∈ Λ such that

E8: Under suitable normalization, Λ8 ⊗Z R is isometric to the Euclidean space R8. Let

E7: Under suitable normalization, Λ7 ⊗Z R is the orthogonal complement in Λ8 ⊗Z R of
any root α ∈ R8. The set of roots R7 is just the set of 126 elements in R8 ∩ (Λ7 ⊗Z R)
and Λ7 is the orthogonal projection of Λ8 to Λ7 ⊗Z R. To see the last point, let G′
C
be a complex simple Lie group of type E8, it contains a subgroup SL2(C). By [Ad96,
Ch. 8], the identity component of the centralizer of SL2(C) in G′

of type E7 and contains the center of SL2(C). This implies GC is simply connected.

Suppose ||w′|| = √2 and the ai are integers, then a1 + a2 must be even for the

R8 ∩ (Λ7 ⊗Z R) = R7. Suppose ||w′|| = √2 and all the ai are half integers, write
ai = bi/2. We have two cases. First, if b1 + b2 is even, then w′ ∈ Λ8 by (36),(35).
Thus, w′ ∈ R8∩(Λ7⊗Z R) = R7. Second, if b1 +b2 is odd, then ||w′||2 = 2 is equivalent

of Λ8 to Λ6⊗Z R. To see the last point, let G′

centralizer of SL3(C) in G′
C, denoted by GC, is of type E6 and contains the center of

C is also simply connected, the

C induces a surjection map of the weight lattices Λ8 ։ Λ6. This

Suppose ||w′|| = √2 and the ai are integers, then a1 + a2 + a3 must be divisible by

w′ ∈ R8 ∩ (Λ6 ⊗Z R) = R6. Suppose ||w′|| = √2 and all the ai are half integers, write
ai = bi/2. We have two cases. First, if b1 + b2 + b3 is divisible by 3, then w′ ∈ Λ8 by

3.2.7. g = G2. The weight lattice Λ is generated by the roots R. By observing the root
system of G2, one sees that the shortest nonzero weights of Λ belong to R. Hence, the short

G′
C is of type
E8, it contains an equal rank subgroup GC of type A8 (resp. D8); when G′
C is of type F4,
it contains an equal rank subgroup GC of type B4 [GOV94, Table 5]. Then we obtain an
embedding f : GC ֒→ G′
C. If the normalizer
NC := NGLN (C)(TC) preserves the roots R of GC, then the Weyl group W ′ of G′
C preserves
R. Since W ′ is orthogonal on Λ⊗Z R, W ′ acts on the set P of Weyl chambers of R ⊂ Λ⊗Z R
[FH91, §14]. Each Weyl chamber corresponds to a set of positive roots R+ of R. The order
of P is equal to the order of W , the Weyl group of GC.
Let R+ ∈ P and H the stabilizer of R+ in W ′. Since W ′ is faithful and orthogonal on
Λ ⊗Z R, H is an automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram [GOV94, Table 1] of GC (or
g). As W is simply transitive on P , we obtain |H| = |W ′|/|W|.

For any embedding f : GC ֒→ GLN (C) in the ﬁrst paragraph, we have |H| > 2 by
the table above. This contradicts that the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of
A7, A8, B4, D8 has order at most 2. We conclude that NC does not preserve the roots R.

Remark 3.3. The exceptional complex simple Lie group G′
C of type G2 contains SL3(C)
(type A2) as an equal rank subgroup. The arguments above do not contradict Theorem 3.2(i)
for GC = SL3(C) because the orders of the Weyl groups of G2 and A2 are respectively 12 and
6 and 12

6 = 2 is the order of the automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of A2.

I would like to thank Gabor Wiese for his interests and comments on the paper.
