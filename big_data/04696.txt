ABSTRACT

While our current cosmological model places galaxy clusters at the nodes of a ﬁlament network (the cosmic web), we still struggle
to detect these ﬁlaments at high redshifts. We perform a weak lensing study for a sample of 16 massive, medium-high redshift
(0.4 < z < 0.9) galaxy clusters from the DAFT/FADA survey, that are imaged in at least three optical bands with Subaru/Suprime-
Cam or CFHT/MegaCam. We estimate the cluster masses using an NFW ﬁt to the shear proﬁle measured in a KSB-like method,
adding our contribution to the calibration of the observable-mass relation required for cluster abundance cosmological studies. We
compute convergence maps and select structures within, securing their detection with noise re-sampling techniques. Taking advantage
of the large ﬁeld of view of our data, we study cluster environment, adding information from galaxy density maps at the cluster redshift
and from X-ray images when available. We ﬁnd that clusters show a large variety of weak lensing maps at large scales and that they
may all be embedded in ﬁlamentary structures at megaparsec scale. We classify them in three categories according to the smoothness
of their weak lensing contours and to the amount of substructures: relaxed (∼ 7%), past mergers (∼ 21.5%), recent or present mergers
(∼ 71.5%). The fraction of clusters undergoing merging events observationally supports the hierarchical scenario of cluster growth,
and implies that massive clusters are strongly evolving at the studied redshifts. Finally, we report the detection of unusually elongated
structures in CLJ0152, MACSJ0454, MACSJ0717, A851, BMW1226, MACSJ1621, and MS1621.

1. Introduction

In Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theories, our Universe can be repre-
sented as an ensemble of Large Scale Structures (LSS) made of
voids and galaxy clusters that are connected through ﬁlamentary
structures (Bond et al. 1996). In this scenario, matter collapses
into halos that then grow through accretion and merging with
other halos. Galaxy clusters are the highest density structures
resulting from this hierarchical formation. N-body simulations
(e.g. Millennium: Springel et al. 2005) and low redshift obser-

(cid:63) Based on observations obtained with MegaCam, a joint project
of CFHT and CEA/IRFU, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
(CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of
Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l’Univers of the Centre
National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS) of France, and the
University of Hawaii. Also based on archive data collected at the Subaru
Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory
of Japan. This research made use of data obtained from the Chandra
Data Archive provided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC), and data
obtained from the XMM–Newton Data Archive provided by the XMM–
Newton Science Archive (XSA).

vations (e.g. SDSS: Tegmark et al. 2004) have conﬁrmed this
evolutionary scheme.

In this framework, galaxy clusters can be used to constrain
cosmological models. Indeed, the distribution of clusters with
mass and redshift contains information on the mentioned hierar-
chical formation scenario (e.g. Allen et al. 2011). The main chal-
lenge is to calibrate the so-called observable-mass relation, that
links true cluster masses to the mass proxy used in the survey.
With its ability of being insensitive to the matter dynamical state,
Weak Lensing (WL) appears as a major tool in determining the
masses of galaxy clusters with suﬃcient precision to derive cos-
mological constraints. However, this technique requires a large
amount of clusters, and therefore more and more WL surveys
with increasing numbers of clusters are conducted (e.g. Dahle
et al. 2002; Cypriano et al. 2004; Clowe et al. 2006; Gavazzi &
Soucail 2007; Hoekstra 2007; Okabe et al. 2010; von der Linden
et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al. 2015). In a similar idea, Martinet et al.
(2015a) recently showed that counting shear peaks can constrain
cosmological parameters almost as well as counting galaxy clus-
ters, without requiring any knowledge of the observable-mass re-
lation, but needing a large number of cosmological simulations.

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

As it directly traces the matter density, WL also allows to
study the LSSs of our Universe. However, the low density of
ﬁlaments compared to clusters makes their detection diﬃcult.
Several studies pioneered in using WL to detect such structures
in the vicinity of clusters either by reporting low signiﬁcance de-
tection or questioning previous claims of detection (e.g. Clowe
et al. 1998; Kaiser et al. 1998; Gray et al. 2002; Gavazzi et al.
2004; Dietrich et al. 2005; Heymans et al. 2008; Dietrich et al.
2012). Note that Massey et al. (2007b) found evidence for a cos-
mic network of ﬁlaments in the COSMOS ﬁeld galaxy survey.
Mead et al. (2010) used the Millennium Simulation (Springel
et al. 2005) to test the ability of various WL techniques to de-
tect nearby cluster ﬁlaments, and concluded that background
galaxy density is key to ﬁlament detection. Future space-based
missions are likely to detect many ﬁlaments, but today, the nar-
row ﬁeld of view of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) does not allow such detec-
tion in a simple way. In this context, deep ground-based imaging
can be very eﬃcient as it often has a much wider ﬁeld of view,
and oﬀers the possibility to cover clusters and their vicinity in
a single image with Subaru/Suprime-Cam or CFHT/Megacam.
Recently, Jauzac et al. (2012) reported the ﬁrst WL detection of
a z = 0.54 cluster with a ﬁlament, MACSJ0717.5+3745 based
on a mosaic of HST/ACS images. This detection was latter con-
ﬁrmed by Medezinski et al. (2013) from a Subaru/Suprime-Cam
WL analysis.

In this paper, we present the WL analysis of 16 clusters
from the Dark energy American French Team (DAFT, in French
FADA) survey. All are medium-high redshift (0.4 ≤ z ≤ 0.9)
massive (M≥ 2 × 1014 M(cid:12)) clusters of galaxies selected through
their X-ray luminosities. This sample is comparable to other X-
ray selected cluster studies such as LOCUSS at 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.3
(Okabe et al. 2010), Weighting the Giants at 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.7
(von der Linden et al. 2014), and CCCP at 0.15 ≤ z ≤ 0.55
(Hoekstra 2007; Hoekstra et al. 2015), with a slightly higher red-
shift, but with fewer clusters than the mentioned surveys which
respectively contain 30, 51, and 50 galaxy clusters. Apart from
estimating cluster masses, we take advantage of the large ﬁeld of
view of our images (8 CFHT/Megacam images with 1 deg2 f.o.v.
and 7 Subaru/Suprime-Cam images with 34 × 27 arcmin2 f.o.v.
- one of the Subaru images contains two clusters) to investigate
galaxy cluster environments. In particular, we report the WL de-
tection of several elongated structures that might correspond to
ﬁlaments.

This paper is structured as follows. Sect. 2 describes our
data set, Sect. 3 presents in detail the shear measurement we
apply, and Sect. 4 the mass reconstruction process. In Sect.5,
we estimate the cluster masses and in Sect. 6 we focus on the
environment of clusters: substructures, mergers, and ﬁlaments.
We conclude in Sect. 7. Throughout the paper, we use a ﬁdu-
cial ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and
H0 = 70 km Mpc−1 s−1. All displayed distances are comoving.

2. Data
2.1. DAFT/FADA
DAFT/FADA is a survey of ∼ 90 medium-high-redshift (0.4 ≤
z ≤ 0.9) massive (M≥ 2 × 1014 M(cid:12)) clusters of galaxies se-
lected through their X-ray luminosities. All of the clusters have
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging available with either
WFPC2 or ACS cameras. We also gathered multi-band optical
and near infrared ground based imaging, using 4m class tele-
scopes for most of the sample. This data set allows to accu-

2

rately measure the ellipticity of galaxies from space and their
photometric redshifts (hereafter photo-z) from the ground. The
main goals of the survey are to form a comprehensive database
to study galaxy clusters and their evolution, and to test cosmo-
logical constraints geometrically by means of weak lensing to-
mography. Several steps have been made towards the achieve-
ment of these two goals, and the current status of the survey,
with a list of refereed publications, can be found at http:
//cesam.lam.fr/DAFT/project.php.

Among other papers, Murphy et al. (2015, A&A submitted)
performed a WL analysis of HST/ACS mosaic imaging data of
ten massive, high-redshift (z > 0.5) DAFT/FADA galaxy clus-
ters. Using the photo-zs calculated by Guennou et al. (2010),
they explored their use for background galaxy discrimination.
Our team is currently increasing this small sample of HST/ACS
shear measurements to a larger number of clusters and also aims
at combining ground-based and space-based shear catalogs to
build a shear analysis which is both deep in the cluster cen-
tral region and extended on larger scales. This will serve as the
reference catalog to perform Weak Lensing Tomography with
Clusters (WLTC) as described in Jain & Taylor (2003).

2.2. This study

In this study, we focus on 16 galaxy clusters for which we have
Subaru/Suprime-Cam or CFHT/Megacam wide ﬁeld images for
at least three optical bands among the v, r, i, and z bands. Having
three bands is mandatory to be able to perform a color-color
cut to remove foreground galaxies that dilute the lensing signal.
The shear measurements are performed in the r or i bands de-
pending on the image seeing. This choice is made to maximize
the number of source galaxies as these bands are the deepest
optical bands. The use of Suprime-Cam (34×27 arcmin2 ﬁeld)
and Megacam (1×1 deg2 ﬁeld) imaging allows to study clusters
within their virial radius and also to see how they interplay with
the surrounding LSS at the selected redshifts (0.4 ≤ z ≤ 0.9).
These ﬁelds of view are much wider than what can be achieved
from current space telescopes, as the HST/ACS ﬁeld of view is
only 3.4×3.4 arcmin2. Besides, the Megacam and Suprime-Cam
cameras present rather stable Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and
contain a large number of stars within each pointing allowing to
accurately estimate the PSF distortion due to the instrument and
atmospheric biases. A list of the data for each cluster can be
found in Table 1.

Some of the clusters from the present study have been an-
alyzed in previous DAFT/FADA papers. Guennou et al. (2014)
derived X-ray luminosities and temperatures for 12 out of these
16 clusters. A comparison of WL and X-ray total masses will
be performed in Sect. 5.2. Guennou et al. (2014) also searched
for substructures using both X-ray data and optical galaxy spec-
troscopy. Martinet et al. (2015b) studied the optical emission of
galaxy clusters and measured the Galaxy Luminosity Functions
(GLFs) for 7 out of these 16 clusters. We indicate in Table 1 for
each cluster in which study it was included.

With the present DM study, we will have a full understanding
of the matter content of a sample of galaxy clusters: the DM halo,
the X-ray Intra Cluster Medium (ICM), and the stars contained
in galaxies. Even if we do not include all the clusters in each
analysis, we will have a general knowledge of cluster behaviors
as observed through WL, X-rays, and optical.

redshift, #5: telescope/camera, #6: ﬁlters; we give ﬁrst the band on which we perform shape measurements and in parenthesis the
two other bands used for the color-color cut, #7: seeing for the band on which we perform shape measurements. Column #8 (G14)
and #9 (M15) show if the cluster has been studied in Guennou et al. (2014) or Martinet et al. (2015b). In the ﬁrst case, we know
if it presents substructures based on X-ray images, and in most cases, also on optical galaxy spectroscopy. For RX J1716.4+6708,
we have spectroscopy but no XMM image. In the second, we have photo-zs in the inner part, and in most cases, an optical galaxy
luminosity function for the cluster. Hereafter, we will use abridged names.

2.3. Image reduction
The Subaru and CFHT data presented here are archive data,
either from previous studies, or from the early phases of
DAFT/FADA.

The CFHT/Megacam data have been reduced by the
TERAPIX team at the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris, using
the astromatic softwares (http://www.astromatic.net/).
Sources are detected with SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996)
and an astrometric solution is found using SCAMP (Bertin 2006).
The stacking of the dithered exposures is then performed using
SWarp (Bertin et al. 2002). We measure the seeing by ﬁtting a
Gaussian surface brightness proﬁle to the bright stars of the im-
age with PSFEx (Bertin 2011).

The images obtained with the Subaru telescope and Suprime-
Cam were retrieved in raw form from the SMOKA archive
(http://smoka.nao.ac.jp/), together with calibration ﬁles
(bias and sky ﬂat ﬁeld exposures), except
the images of
MACSJ0717, that were taken from Medezinski et al. (2013).
They were reduced in the usual way, by subtracting an average
bias and dividing by the normalized ﬂat ﬁeld in each ﬁlter ex-
actly in the same way as the images we observed ourselves. The
reduced images were then calibrated astrometrically using the
SCAMP and SWarp tools, and combined for each ﬁlter. The pho-
tometric calibration was made in priority with SDSS catalogs
when available in the ﬁeld and in the corresponding band. If not
available, we used the observed standard stars.

phenomenon, check e.g., the review by Bartelmann & Schneider
(2001). The main diﬃculty of the method is to take into account
all the galaxy shape distortions that are not due to the shear sig-
nal, such as atmospheric variations and instrumental biases. To
correct for these biases, we apply a KSB+ method, initially pro-
posed by Kaiser et al. (1995) and later reﬁned by Luppino &
Kaiser (1997); Hoekstra et al. (1998). The KSB method suits
well shear measurements in cluster ﬁelds as assessed by the var-
ious large surveys choosing this technique (Okabe et al. 2010;
von der Linden et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al. 2015). In addition, it
has been accurately tested on simulated images such as, e.g. the
STEP2 simulations by Massey et al. (2007a). Most of the WL
reduction presented here is similar to the technique applied in
Clowe et al. (2012).

We ﬁrst detect objects using SExtractor and clean the
catalog from spurious detections (Sect. 3.1). We separate
stars from galaxies and measure the instrument Point Spread
Function (PSF) variation on stars (Sect. 3.2) using the
IMCAT software (Kaiser (2011): http://www.ifa.hawaii.
edu/˜kaiser/imcat/) with some additional developments.
We correct galaxy shapes for the PSF anisotropies to obtain an
individual object shear catalog (Sect. 3.3). We then smooth the
shear measurement noise (Sect. 3.4) and correct for the method-
ology biases by testing our reduction on the STEP2 (Massey
et al. 2007a) shear simulations (Sect. 3.5).

3.1. Source detection

3. Shear measurement
The main idea of lensing is to reconstruct the mass distribution of
a foreground object, designated as the lens, through the deﬂec-
tion it induces on the background object light, namely galaxy
sources. In the WL regime, the deﬂection is smaller than the
typical intrinsic ellipticity of a galaxy (of the order of the per-
cent), so that we must take the mean of many shear measure-
ments from individual galaxies to reach a high signal-to-noise
(S/N) detection of the shear. For a complete description of this

We use SExtractor to detect objects and measure their photometry
in our images. In most cases, the precise alignments of the three
bands are suﬃcient to allow a detection in double image mode.
We then perform the initial detection in the band used for shape
measurements and detect objects in the same apertures and posi-
tions in the two other images. For some Subaru images, we did
not manage to align precisely the images from all three bands.
The detection is then performed separately in each band and
measurements are associated to those in the band on which the

3

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

ellipticity measurement is done. This cross correlation is done
through a minimization of matched object distances with a 2 arc-
sec limit. We detect all objects which lie on at least three pixels
above 1.5 times the sky background after convolving the sur-
face brightness proﬁle with a Gaussian kernel of 7 × 7 pixel size
and 3 pixel FWHM. We use 32 deblending sub-thresholds with
a deblending contrast close to zero in order to remove most of
the possible blended objects that would have a modiﬁed shape.
Object magnitudes are measured with the MAG AUTO keyword.
We then compute the signal-to-noise ratio of each object us-
ing the getsig IMCAT tool. This command convolves the object
surface brightness proﬁle with a Gaussian ﬁlter of increasing
smoothing radius rg and selects the value of rg that maximizes
the signal-to-noise. We obtain at the same time the best signal-
to-noise ratio for the object and an estimate of its size with the rg
parameter. The local background is computed by ﬁtting a mean
sky level and a 2-d linear slope of the sky brightness in an an-
nulus centered on the object, ignoring all the pixels within 3rg
of any object to avoid contamination. Once this accurate signal-
to-noise is computed, we remove all objects with signal-to-noise
lower than 10.

We measure the 1st to 4th order of the surface brightness
proﬁle of each object in a circular aperture of size 3rg using a
Gaussian weighting with σ = rg, through the getshapes IMCAT
command. We reject objects for which the ﬁrst moment of the
surface brightness proﬁle does not coincide within one pixel,
with the object peak position as detected by SExtractor. We ad-
just the position of the remaining objects to the ﬁrst moment of
the surface brightness proﬁle which represents a sub-pixel esti-
mate of the object peak position and re-measure the object shape
centered on this new position.

We then apply a series of cuts to remove likely spurious de-
tections. We ﬁrst remove all objects that have a smaller size than
the instrument PSF, i.e. having a radius rg smaller than the min-
imum radius of stars, selected in a magnitude versus rg diagram.
We also remove all objects located at less than 20 pixels from
the image edges to avoid measuring truncated objects. Finally,
we remove bad pixel detection and only keep objects that do not
have any neighbor within 10 pixels of their center.

This catalog is then separated between stars and galaxies in
a half light radius rh versus magnitude plot, as shown in Fig. 1.
Stars are selected as objects lying on the constant radius se-
quence and with appropriate magnitudes. This magnitude range
is set by hand to avoid saturated stars and too faint objects.
Galaxies are selected as all objects larger than the star sequence
at the same magnitude excluding the saturated objects that can
be seen in the bright part of the diagram.

3.2. PSF measurement
The PSF of a given image represents the response of the in-
strument to a point like source in the conditions of observation.
Its variations across the image are due to the instrument char-
acteristics and to the weather conditions. CFHT/Megacam and
Subaru/Suprime-Cam have rather stable PSFs suitable for WL.
Having a good seeing also diminishes the PSF correction that we
need to apply. As stars are point like sources, they are suitable
for measuring the PSF of an image. The large ﬁeld of view of
our images enables us to have enough stars in a single frame to
correct for the PSF anisotropies, on the contrary of smaller ﬁeld
of view cameras that often require to use stars across several im-
ages.

A general image distortion can be expressed by the two fol-
lowing quantities: the smear polarizability tensor Psm that de-

jects above the star sequence are considered as galaxies.

star, Psh

scribes the object response to the PSF anisotropy, and the shear
polarizability tensor Psh that describes its response to the shear.
These two tensors are measured from the 0th, 2nd and 4th order
moments of an object surface brightness distribution. We refer
the reader to Kaiser et al. (1995) and Hoekstra et al. (1998) for
the expression of these tensors. The ellipticity e, is estimated
from the 2nd order moments of this distribution. In the next
subsection we will use the following quantities, as measured on
stars, to infer the true shape of galaxies: Psm

star, and estar.

Before measuring those quantities, we reﬁne the star cata-
log to the cleanest objects. We ﬁrst remove all objects that are
closer than 40 pixels to any other object. We then ﬁt the star el-
lipticities with a two dimension polynomial of the 6th order and
generate modeled ellipticities at each object position using this
polynomial. Objects that have a measured ellipticity diﬀering by
more than 0.05 from their modeled ellipticity are rejected. This
step is repeated three times, and permits to remove galaxies that
might have been considered as stars. We chose an ellipticity cut
at 0.05 as we found that it removes objects that are mainly out
of the whole sample ellipticity distribution. Finally, a visual in-
spection is carried out to remove all remaining objects that could
still suﬀer from blending issues or being close to saturated stars.
The ﬁnal catalogs contain ∼ 1000 and ∼ 3000 stars in average
for Subaru and Megacam images respectively, leading to an av-
erage star density of 1.0 arcmin−2 and 0.8 arcmin−2 respectively
for Subaru and Megacam.

Star shapes are measured using the getshapes IMCAT tool.
As Psm and Psh depend on object sizes, we have to measure
them for various sets of weighting radii. Hence, we compute
a series of tensors for each rg between 1 and 10 pixels with a
step of 0.5 pixels, so that we can use the tensors corresponding
to the galaxy radius when correcting for the PSF. Final quan-
tities are ﬁtted by 6th-order 2D polynomials as a function of
position in order to have continuous functions deﬁned at ev-
ery point of the image. Here we chose to measure the PSF over
the entire image, using a high order polynomial ﬁt. However,
in the case of large ﬁeld-of-view images, one could also di-
vide the frame into several small patches, and ﬁt the PSF in
each tile with a lower order polynomial. While the second ap-
proach is used in various studies (Okabe et al. 2010; Umetsu

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

et al. 2011), von der Linden et al. (2014) applied and vali-
dated the ﬁrst approach in the case of Subaru/Suprime-Cam im-
ages. For the CFHT/Megacam data, while ﬁtting the PSF on
each chip, Hoekstra (2007) found negligible discontinuities in
the PSF anisotropy between chips. Following e.g. Massey et al.
(2005), we compute the auto-correlation function of star ellip-
ticities before and after the PSF correction and the cross cor-
relation function between galaxy shear and star ellipticities in
Appendix A, validating our PSF correction.

3.3. PSF correction
In the absence of noise the shear of a background galaxy (ggal)
can be computed from the following equation:

ggal =

Pg
gal

δegal,

(1)

where Pg
gal is the shear susceptibility tensor deﬁned in eq. 2,
and δegal the apparent change in ellipticity, described in eq. 3.
Note that in this equation we neglect the intrinsic ellipticity that
should be subtracted to the apparent ellipticity change (δegal).
This is true if a suﬃcient number of galaxies is taken into ac-
count: the galaxies being randomly oriented, the intrinsic ellip-
ticity is null in average.

The shear susceptibility tensor represents the PSF corrected
distortion, i.e. only due to the shear. We deﬁne it as in Luppino
& Kaiser (1997):

Pg

where the gal index is for tensors measured on galaxies, and star
for tensors measured on stars. The apparent change in ellipticity
is:

δegal = egal − Psm

gal

(3)
where e represents the object ellipticity. In order to compute a
galaxy shear, we then need to measure its ellipticity vector, and
its smear polarizability and shear polarizability tensors. This is
again done with the getshapes tool. We also generate the star
quantities corresponding to each galaxy radius rg using the poly-
nomials computed in the last section.

Prior to measuring the shape of galaxies, we reject QSOs and
cosmic rays by removing objects that lie away from the princi-
pal sequence in a maximum ﬂux versus magnitude diagram. We
also remove objects in regions where the sky level is too bright
to avoid star diﬀraction halos. We restrict our catalogs to ob-
jects larger than 1.5 times the PSF size, deﬁned as the minimum
star radius rg, deleting objects on which the PSF deconvolution
could be too noisy. Finally, we visually inspect the images to
remove any object close to saturated stars or reduction artifacts
that could have survived our previous cleaning.

3.4. Noise smoothing and co-addition
The individual shear values are noisy due to the sky noise in the
measurements of the higher order moments of the light distri-
bution of objects. As these moments are subtracted one to each
other when computing the shear polarizibility tensor, the ﬁnal
signal value is reduced while the noise increases. We then have
to smooth the noise in the shear polarizibility tensor measure-
ment to avoid it dominating the shear measurement, using its
distribution across the image. We ﬁt each component of the shear
polarizability tensor Pg
gal as a function of one component of the

ellipticity and of the object size rg by a 4th order two dimension
polynomial. We chose a 4th order polynomial after testing sev-
eral orders, as we found that it was minimizing the noise. Also,
we ﬁnd that the shear polarizability tensor weakly depends on
the ellipticity but is more sensitive to the object size. We then
use this modeled tensor to re-generate the shear values of each
object following eq. 1. We note that this step removes the noise
that would cause negative values of the shear polarizability ten-
sor. We verify that after this ﬁtting procedure, we do not have
Pg
gal values lower than 0.1.

Finally, we weight the individual shear values according to
their signiﬁcance compared to their neighbors in the (rg,S /N)
plane. In practice, this weight factor is set to the inverse of the
root mean square of the shear of the 50 nearest neighbors for a
region around each galaxy size and signiﬁcance. Generally, the
small, faint galaxies are given a low weight and larger, bright
galaxies are given a high weight, due to the larger galaxies be-
ing aﬀected only by the intrinsic shape noise while the smaller,
fainter galaxies also have a signiﬁcant noise component coming
from sky noise in their shear measurements. In addition, sub-
areas presenting a large shear dispersion will contribute less than
sub-areas with a low shear dispersion.

3.5. Bias calibration
We measure the bias of our method on the STEP2 simulations
(Massey et al. 2007a) that provide images computed with various
PSFs, and with an added constant shear across each image. We
use the sets of images characterized by a Subaru PSF with a
seeing of 0.8 arcsec (PSF C). This PSF suits well our data as
about half of our images are from Subaru and our image seeing
lies between 0.6 <  < 1.0 arcsec. However, note that the STEP2
images are 7 × 7 arcmin2 size, while our images are of the order
of 34 × 27 arcmin2 for Suprime-Cam and 60 × 60 arcmin2 for
MegaCam. Hence, the PSF should be better sampled in the true
images.

Applying our reduction pipeline, we calculate the average
shear of each of the 64 simulated galaxy ﬁelds and ﬁt the diﬀer-
ence between our shear estimate and the true shear as a function
of the true shear, according to the notation of eq. 4 from Massey
et al. (2007a):

γi − γtrue

i

= mi × γtrue

i

+ ci,

(4)

where i is the index for both shear components. The values we
have found for the multiplicative biases m1 and m2 and the addi-
tive biases c1 and c2 are shown in Table 2.

Our results compare well with the ones from other methods
as described in the STEP2 challenge (Massey et al. 2007a). As
expected, the additive bias is rather negligible and the shear is
slightly underestimated with the KSB method. The multiplica-
tive bias can be seen as an evaluation of the quality of the shear
measurement. Our results hence show that we can measure the
galaxy shear with an accuracy better than ∼ 5%. We correct each

5

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

component of the shear for the multiplicative bias, and thus ob-
tain our ﬁnal shear catalog. Note that we do not correct for the
additive bias which is strongly PSF dependent, and rather prefer
to leave it as a potential systematic bias, small compared to the
other sources of errors.

4. Mass reconstruction

We then translate the measured shear signal to a mass estimate.
We ﬁrst apply the standard Seitz & Schneider (1995) inversion
technique based on the Kaiser & Squires (1993) algorithm to
calculate a convergence density map (Sect. 4.2). This technique
allows to draw signiﬁcance contour levels on the cluster image
to search for structures but does not allow to recover the true
masses of objects. Indeed, the integration of the shear over a ﬁ-
nite space introduces a constant called the mass sheet degeneracy
that cannot be properly taken into account without a magniﬁca-
tion study. To avoid this problem, we ﬁt NFW shear proﬁles on
clusters to infer their 3D mass distribution in Sect. 4.3. In any
case, we ﬁrst have to select galaxies that lie behind the struc-
tures we aim to detect, to avoid diluting the shear signal. This is
done in Sect. 4.1, where we also estimate the mean background
galaxy redshift, as this quantity is required to convert the shear
and the convergence into mass.

4.1. Background galaxies

4.1.1. Color cuts

Foreground and cluster galaxies are not lensed by the cluster.
Hence, they will appear as noise in the co-adding of individual
shear measurements, and have to be deleted. The most accurate
way to select background galaxies is to use spectroscopic red-
shifts, but it requires too much observational time. Photometric
redshifts are more promising, as less time-consuming, and are
starting to give accurate redshift estimations. However, we do
not have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all galaxies
and therefore we must consider galaxy colors. Galaxy colors are
linked to the galaxy formation history and can be used as a crude
approximation of the galaxy redshift.

We select background galaxies in a color-color diagram,
comparing our galaxy colors to those from galaxy templates
computed at various redshifts. We generate templates for early
and late type galaxies using EzGal (Mancone & Gonzalez 2012)
with Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models, assuming a Chabrier
(2003) Initial Mass Function (IMF), a formation redshift of
zform = 4, and a solar metallicity. The red early type galaxies
are modeled with a single starburst model and the blue late type
galaxies by an exponentially decaying star formation model. We
remove all galaxies that correspond to the color-color area cov-
ered by template galaxies at redshift z < zclus + 0.2. For example,
we show the color-color diagram of RXJ1716 with the removed
area in Fig. 2. Note that the colors we use vary from one cluster
to another according to the available optical bands (see Table 1).
We also cut all the remaining galaxies with magnitudes brighter
than i = 22 or r = 22.5 (depending on the image on which
the shear measurement is performed), as they are very likely
foreground galaxies given the high redshift of our clusters. In
the same manner, galaxies fainter than i = 25 or r = 25.5 are
removed as they are fainter than the depth of our images, and
therefore not reliable.

dots represent galaxies from our catalog. Circles are late type
galaxy templates and squares early types. Green is for tem-
plates at ±0.2 around the cluster redshift, blue for lower-redshift
galaxy templates and red for higher-redshift galaxy templates.
The black polygon circling green and blue points correspond to
the color area we remove from our catalog. See text for details
on used galaxy templates.

4.1.2. Boost factor

To check that the color-color cuts removed cluster dwarf galax-
ies, we computed the number density of galaxies in our lensing
catalog as a function of radius from the brightest cluster galaxy,
correcting for loss of sky area due to the presence of bright
galaxies and stars in each radial bin. Due to the magniﬁcation
depletion eﬀect (Smail et al. 1995), the number density of back-
ground galaxies should either be ﬂat or decrease with decreas-
ing cluster centric distance, with the exact eﬀect depending on
the slope of the change in number counts with increasing magni-
tude for galaxies in and slightly fainter than the lensing catalog.
In contrast, dwarf galaxies number density should increase with
decreasing cluster centric radius, and thus any increase seen in
the number density of the lensing catalog towards the cluster
center is indicative that not all cluster galaxies were removed by
the color cuts. The ratio of the number density of galaxies in
the lensing catalog a given annular bin compared to the number
density at large cluster radius can then be used as an estimate
of the contamination fraction of cluster galaxies. Under the as-
sumption that the cluster galaxies’ shapes are uncorrelated and
should average to zero shear, this correction factor can then be
used to boost the measured shear in the inner regions of the clus-
ters to correct for the presence of cluster galaxies in the lensing
catalog (Clowe & Schneider 2001). It should be noted that this
is a conservative estimate of the fraction of cluster galaxies as
we are assuming the underlying density of background galaxies
is ﬂat and not depleted towards the cluster center, however as
the cosmic variance of the slope of the background galaxy num-
ber density with magnitude relation on arc minute sized patches
can be quite large, estimates of the magniﬁcation depletion eﬀect
for individual clusters are too noisy to provide better constraints
(Schneider et al. 2000).

We ﬁt the radial proﬁle of the normalized galaxy density with

an exponential function of the form:

1 + f (r) = 1 + A × exp(−r/r0),

(5)

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

1.7 deg2 after masking, down to a magnitude of i = 25, and are
adapted to our redshift range. Furthermore, the photometric red-
shifts of COSMOS are computed with a high precision, using 30
bands from near-UV to mid-IR. We ﬁrst apply the same magni-
tude and color cuts than those applied to our shear catalog. We
then remove all galaxies that have a photometric redshift smaller
than that of the cluster and calculate the mean of the ratio of
the source to lens versus source distances Dls/Ds, applying an
appropriate weight. The weighting function is generated on the
COSMOS galaxy sub-sample from a 2D polynomial ﬁtted on
the shear weighting function in our data in a half-light radius
versus magnitude plane. We use the magnitude instead of the
S/N ratio as the second coordinate because the S/N in COSMOS
and in our data can vary signiﬁcantly. Finally, the weights gen-
erated on COSMOS are re-normalized to 1. The mean redshift
of background galaxies is then set to the one that allows to ﬁnd
the measured mean distance ratio Dls/Ds. These redshifts can be
found in Table 3.

4.2. 2D mass map
We reconstruct the projected convergence ﬁeld by inverting the
shear in Fourier-space, following Seitz & Schneider (1995). This
technique is an iterative application of the Kaiser & Squires
(1993) algorithm to correct for the fact that we measure the re-
duced shear, which is equal to the shear γ divided by 1 − κ, and
not the shear. We reconstruct the ﬁrst convergence map assuming
κ = 0 in the shear, and then generate a map from the shear where
the convergence is set to the previous map in the loop until the
process converges. We ﬁnd that the convergence map remains
constant within 0.01% after three realizations. This technique
allows to better estimate the mass map around high masses and
is therefore particularly suitable for our cluster mass reconstruc-
tion. The convergence ﬁeld is smoothed with a Gaussian ﬁlter of
width θs = 1 arcmin at each step of the algorithm, before read-
ing oﬀ which convergence to use to correct for a given galaxy.
The noise level in the ﬁnal convergence map can be estimated as
eq. 6 (van Waerbeke 2000):

σ(cid:113)

4πnbgθ2
s

σκ =

,

(6)

where nbg is the density of background galaxies and σ the dis-
persion of the ellipticities of the background galaxies. nbg and
σ are estimated independently for each image, taking into ac-
count the weight function of the shear. σ ranges from 0.27 to
0.32 across our data, while nbg can be found in Table 3 for each
cluster.

One can then convert the convergence map into a surface
mass density map using the deﬁnition of the convergence (eq. 7):

κ =

Σ
Σcrit

,

(7)

where Σ is the surface mass density and Σcrit the critical surface
mass density deﬁned in eq. 8:

Σcrit =

c2
4πG

Ds
DlDls

.

(8)

c is the speed of light, G the gravitational constant, and Ds, Dl,
and Dls are respectively the distance to the source, the distance to
the lens, and the distance between the source and the lens. This
conversion hence only requires the knowledge of the lens and
source redshifts, calculated in Sect. 4.1. As we cannot properly

ﬁt (see eq. 5) to the data.

where A and r0 are constrained by the ﬁt. We then apply
this function to boost shear values in the cluster vicinity. The
weights are also modiﬁed according to the error on the ﬁt to
the density proﬁle. We show in Fig. 3 the stacked normalized
galaxy density along with the best ﬁt for our boost factor. The
error bars are computed from the dispersion over all clusters
and show that
the boost factor varies from one cluster to
another, requiring individual ﬁts. The galaxy density proﬁles
are computed using the WL peak as the center. As a sanity
check, we also computed the density proﬁles centered on the
BCG and found no signiﬁcant variation in the mass estimates of
our clusters. Note that we neglected the eﬀect of magniﬁcation
when estimating the radial galaxy density proﬁle, but Okabe
& Smith (2015) showed that doing so only decreases the
amplitude of the shear proﬁle by ∼ 10% on scales lower than
one tenth of the virial radius. Applying the corrections above
as a function of radius from the cluster center results in the
increase in the measured cluster masses. To be exact, the boost
factor aﬀects the concentration, and then the mass as we ﬁxed
the concentration parameter to break the mass concentration
degeneracy (see Sect. 4.3). The largest increase in mass is 30%
(MACJ0717), while the mean increase is 9% and the median 6%.

4.1.3. Distance measurements
Another issue is to measure the distances of the lens and of the
background galaxies. These observables are required to estimate
the mass of the lens, which depends on the ratio of the source
to observer distance over the source to lens distance: Ds/Dls.
We estimate the lens distance through the spectroscopic redshift
of the cluster. The classical way of estimating the mean back-
ground galaxy distance is to average the distance ratio Ds/Dls
over all source galaxies. See also Applegate et al. (2014) for a
method that uses all galaxy background photometric redshifts in
a Bayesian formalism.

As we do not have photometric redshifts for background
galaxies, we consider an external redshift distribution. We use
the COSMOS data (Ilbert et al. 2009) as our redshift distribution.
These data are well suitable as they cover a large area of about

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

account for the mass sheet degeneracy in our reconstruction, we
did not try to estimate the mass of clusters through the conver-
gence map. These mass maps are thus only used to detect clus-
ters and their surrounding structures, while the cluster masses
are estimated in the next section ﬁtting an NFW proﬁle to the
shear.

The signiﬁcance of the detection is computed from a noise
re-sampling technique, adding a random ellipticity to every
galaxy for each realization. To preserve the shape noise proper-
ties of the sample, we draw the added ellipticities from the image
galaxy catalog. Doing so, we neglect the additional shear signal
as it is very unlikely that it correlates with the detected structures
√
given the large number of galaxies in our catalogs. The shape
noise used in eq. 6 is increased by a factor of
2 as the ellip-
ticity of galaxies now corresponds to the sum of two Gaussian
distributions with a null mean and a width σ. We perform a
hundred realizations for each catalog, computing the detection
level of every structure at each step. The mean and dispersion of
these detection levels give a strong estimate of the signiﬁcance
of the detection. We also measure the number of realizations in
which the structure is detected at more than 3σ above the map
noise. For example we can be very conﬁdent in a structure de-
tected at more than 3σ in 95% of the realizations. In addition,
this noise re-sampling allows to reﬁne the measure of the po-
sition of each structure, computing the mean and dispersion of
the local maximum position over all noise realizations. These
quantities respectively correspond to an estimate of the structure
center and to the error on its position.

For example, we show in Fig. 4 the 3-band-color image with
the convergence contours overlaid for MACSJ1621. The con-
tours are spaced in units of the map noise computed from eq. 6,
starting at 3σ. We display the same ﬁgure for every cluster with
X-ray emissivity and galaxy light density contours when avail-
able in Sect. 6. As a sanity check, we computed the mass map
with shear rotated by 45 degrees (white contours) and found that
the signal due to the cluster presence disappears in this map,
validating our convergence map reconstruction method. The po-
sition of the WL peaks are noted by white crosses with a 1 for
the cluster and a 2 for the main secondary structure. The cluster
is detected at (6.8 ± 1.4)σκ in the center region and an elongated
structure aligned with the cluster major axis can be seen at a
(5.9 ± 1.7)σκ conﬁdence level computed from the mean and dis-
persion of a hundred realizations of the noise. These two struc-
tures are detected in respectively 97 and 96 % of the realizations.
The nature of the secondary peak is discussed in Sect. 6 compar-
ing the WL with other probes (X-ray and optics). The center
positions are estimated with a precision of about 200 kpc. Also,
we note an oﬀset between the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG)
marked by a yellow cross and the WL peak. This oﬀset is dis-
cussed in Sect. 5.3, where we estimate cluster masses at both
positions.

In spite of all our care to build accurate mass maps, some
peaks will arise from the noise. One must evaluate the number
of these fake peaks in order to discuss the detection of structures
in the mass maps. As the number of fake peaks depends both
on the density of background galaxies and on the redshifts of
the lens and sources, we compute the fake peak probability for
each cluster ﬁeld. To do so, we assign a random position to each
galaxy in the frame, to make sure that no structure from the orig-
inal positions would be left in the simulation. We then use this
new ellipticity catalog as an input to our mass map pipeline. The
resulting convergence map should be representative of the noise.
However, the presence of the cluster also modiﬁes the distribu-
tion of fake peaks. To take this into account, we add to the ellip-

8

ticity of each galaxy, shear values based on the ﬁtted NFW pro-
ﬁle of the corresponding cluster (see Sect. 4.3). We ﬁnd slightly
fewer peaks when adding the cluster. This is due to the fact that
some noise peaks can be aligned with the cluster, and also be-
cause the presence of the cluster is compensated by negative
convergence values in the mass map as the mean convergence
in the reconstruction is set to zero. We do a hundred realiza-
tions to capture the statistical properties of the fake peaks. For
MACSJ0717, we also performed 10,000 realizations to check
that our 100 realizations are suﬃcient. We ﬁnd little diﬀerence
between the two cases. Quantitatively, we ﬁnd 11.1 peaks above
3σκ and 1.3 above 4σκ in the entire Suprime-Cam ﬁeld for 100
realizations, and 10.9 and 1.2 above 3σκ and 4σκ for 10,000 real-
izations. In any case we ﬁnd less than 0.1 fake peaks above 5σκ.
When discussing the detection of structures in Sect. 6, we give
the expected number of fake peaks in the displayed area for each
cluster. We note that in Fig. 4, the white contours corresponding
to the reconstruction of the orthonormal shear component, are in
good agreement with the expected number of fake peaks for the
displayed ﬁeld (2.9 above 3σκ and 0.4 above 4σκ in the left-hand
ﬁeld).

4.3. Cluster mass ﬁt
To infer the cluster mass distribution, we choose to ﬁt the shear
proﬁle centered on the cluster. This avoids having to measure the
shear in the cluster core, and partially breaks the mass sheet de-
generacy by imposing a given mass proﬁle on the data. We note
that using this radial technique on N-body simulated clusters,
Becker & Kravtsov (2011); Bah´e et al. (2012) found a system-
atic underestimate of cluster masses of roughly 5%, which we
do not correct for as the exact correction factor is likely to be
a function of the chosen cosmologcial paramaters (and is small
compared to the uncertainties for all of our clusters). The NFW
density proﬁle (Navarro et al. 1996) deﬁned in eq. 9 is among
the best available proﬁles to ﬁt observed galaxy clusters (e.g.
Umetsu et al. 2011).

ρNFW(r) =

(9)

where rs is the scale radius and ρs a density expressed as ρcritδc.
ρcrit = 3H2/8πG is the critical density of the Universe at the
cluster redshift, and δc is a dimensionless density that depends
on the DM halo, and that can be expressed as a function of the
concentration parameter:

δc =

(10)

where ∆ is the overdensity compared to the critical density,
c∆ = r∆/rs is the concentration parameter. By integration of the
density under spherical symmetry, the mass MNFW,∆ in a given
radius r∆, can be estimated as a function of r∆ and c∆ only:

MNFW,∆ =

4πρsr3

The radial shear proﬁle has an analytic formula derived in
e.g. Wright & Brainerd (2000), that we ﬁt to the measured shear
to obtain r∆ and c∆ which are converted into a cluster mass ac-
cording to eq. 11. There is a known degeneracy between the con-
centration c∆ and the mass M∆ (e.g. Diemer & Kravtsov 2014;
Meneghetti et al. 2014), or equivalently r∆ in our case. We show
in Fig. 5 the degeneracy between both parameters of our NFW

ﬁt for two clusters representative of the large (MACSJ0717) and
low (NEP200) signiﬁcance detections. These plots highlight the
need to break the degeneracy between the two parameters espe-
cially in the low signiﬁcance case. This can be achieved using
predictions of the typical concentration of clusters from cosmo-
logical N-body simulations, and one can either choose a mean
concentration for all clusters in the sample (e.g. Applegate
et al. 2014) or use a mass-redshift-concentration relation (e.g.
Hoekstra et al. 2015). To break the degeneracy between r∆ and
c∆, we ﬁx the concentration parameter to c200 = 3.5, since Gao
et al. (2008) demonstrated that very massive clusters have con-
centration parameters between 3 and 4 at the studied redshifts.
This choice of a ﬁxed concentration parameter imposes a sys-
tematic error on each individual cluster mass although the aver-
age should be correct. We quantify the error on the mass mea-
surement due to the intrinsic scatter of 1.34 on the concentration
parameter estimate in Gao et al. (2008) by ﬁxing the concen-
tration parameter to 2.16 and 4.84, which represent the scatter
around our chosen value of c200 = 3.5. We ﬁnd a variation of
the mass of about ±25%. This error is not added to the error
budget of Table 3. As a result of our choice of breaking the
mass-concentration degeneracy by ﬁxing the concentration pa-
rameter, any concentration eﬀect, such as the boost factor (see
Sect. 4.1.2) or the oﬀ-centering eﬀect (see Sect. 5.3), directly
aﬀects the mass estimate.

The ﬁt is done in an annulus where the inner radius is iter-
atively set to a value larger than the Einstein radius, to remove
the area aﬀected by strong lensing. We also require to have a
minimum number of objects in every bin, which can push the
inner radius to large physical values in the case of high redshift
clusters. The outer radius is set to the value at which the output
r∆ does not signiﬁcantly change (less than 1%) if we probe a
larger area. We also ensure that the outer radius is at least larger
than the output r∆. The ﬁt is performed on the tangential shear
computed to the cluster center, which is deﬁned as the highest
peak close to the cluster position in the convergence map recon-

struction. We discuss the possibility of using the BCG instead of
the WL peak as the center in Sect. 5.3, but we shall mainly dis-
cuss masses centered on the WL peak in the following. Cluster
masses are shown in Table 3.

An estimate of the signiﬁcance of the ﬁt is obtained by com-
puting the ∆χ2 between the best ﬁt NFW model and a zero mass
model. The tangential shear proﬁles for every cluster can be
found in Appendix B, where the error bars correspond to the
orthonormal shear that should be equal to zero in the absence
of noise. We measure r200 from the best NFW ﬁt and then com-
pute M200, and M500. We note that for clusters where the NFW
ﬁt has a low signiﬁcance value (σ < 3), the tangential shear pro-
ﬁle presents error bars consistent with no signal. We then do not
compute a mass for these clusters, as their shear proﬁle is not
reliable.

The errors are computed using the same noise re-sampling
method than for the mass maps (see Sect. 4.2). A random ellip-
ticity is drawn from our catalog and added to each galaxy. Then,
the best NFW ﬁt gives a new value for r200 and M200. The mean
and the dispersion over a hundred noise realizations are used as
the true value and its error. The r200 and various mass values are
given in Table 3 of Sect. 5.

5. Galaxy clusters

In this section we present the results concerning the 16 galaxy
clusters that we have studied. The discussion is based on the
masses obtained from the NFW ﬁts presented in Sect. 4.3 and
given in Table 3. After discussing the WL masses (Sect. 5.1), we
compare them to the X-ray values from the literature (Sect. 5.2),
and then analyze the eﬀect of using the BCG as the cluster cen-
ter instead of the WL center (Sect. 5.3). The comparison of indi-
vidual cluster masses with other studies is done jointly with the
environment discussion in the next section (Sect. 6).

5.1. WL Masses

The results of the best NFW ﬁt are given only when its signiﬁ-
cance is higher than 3σ, because otherwise such masses would
not be reliable. This means that we were not able to constrain
the masses of all clusters (see Table 3 and shear proﬁles in
Appendix B). The fact that some of our ﬁts do not converge can
have several explanations depending on each case. One obvi-
ous limitation is the background galaxy density: as the noise is
proportional to the inverse square root of the background den-
sity, the deeper the observations, the higher the signal-to-noise
of the shear. The data obtained with Subaru, which is an 8m
class telescope, are less aﬀected than those obtained with the
CFHT, which is only a 4m class telescope. The masses of the

clusters and the noise in the images are also important factors.
A high mass cluster will tend to be detected even with a low
background galaxy density. Finally, we note that the redshift of
the cluster also plays a role. For example, BMW-HRI J122657
is a rather massive cluster, but at a redshift of z = 0.89. As the
lensing eﬀect is measured on the galaxies behind the cluster, the
higher the redshift, the more diﬃcult it is to detect the cluster. A
redshift of z ∼ 0.9 is close to the accessible limit, as lensing is
most sensitive to structures at redshifts around z ∼ 0.3 − 0.4.

We present the individual shear proﬁles in Appendix B. In
Fig. 6 we show a stacked shear proﬁle including all 12 clusters
for which it was possible to compute a mass. The black dots
correpond to the stacking of all individual cluster shear proﬁles,
the error bars being the dispersion of each shear bin values. In

Fig. 6. Stacked shear proﬁle for the 12 clusters for which we
were able to safely measure the mass. Black points correspond to
the stacked proﬁles and blue points to the proﬁle of the stacked
shear catalogs (see text for details). In the ﬁrst case error bars
are the dispersion of values in the stack, and in the second the
rotated shear. Radius is in comoving distance and in kpc units.
Individual proﬁles are centered on the WL peak. The red curve
is the best NFW ﬁt to the stacked proﬁle.

addition we also coadd the shear catalogs recentered to the WL
peak and compute a global shear proﬁle, using the mean redshift
of the clusters to convert into comoving distance (blue points).
In this case the error bars correspond to the rotated shear as for
the individual proﬁles. Both methods agree very well. In the sec-
ond case the error bars are smaller because we get more galaxies
per radial bin, but it does not take into account the dispersion in
the shears. In our study, we have enough signal-to-noise in each
cluster to also do the stacking of the individual shear proﬁles.
Though the error bars are still large given that we have only a
small number of clusters, most of the noisy or asymmetrical ir-
regularities have been washed out, and the stacked shear proﬁle
is well represented by an NFW spherical proﬁle.

For the clusters for which we were able to compute masses,
we ﬁnd error bars typical of WL studies. We note however, that
using the noise re-sampling method to determine the mass in-
creases our errors over using only the signiﬁcance of the best
NFW ﬁt. We choose to show the former errors because they are
more robust and more conservative. We do not statistically com-
pare our masses with other WL studies because we have only
few clusters in common. Three of our clusters are studied in
the Mahdavi et al. (2013) sample, three in the CCCP sample
(Hoekstra et al. 2015), three in the Weighting the Giants sam-
ple (Applegate et al. 2014), two in the Fo¨ex et al. (2012) sam-
ple, one is studied in Jauzac et al. (2012) and Medezinski et al.
(2013), and one in Israel et al. (2014). Nonetheless, a compari-
son of the WL masses, and also with the X-ray and strong lens-
ing estimates, is done for each cluster in Sect. 6.1. In the next
subsection, we compare our WL masses with those derived from
X-rays to evaluate potential biases in both measurements.

5.2. X-ray and WL masses
The X-ray masses come from two diﬀerent samples. Most of
them have XMM–Newton data and are taken from Guennou et al.
(2014). We add four clusters that have Chandra data and belong
to the Maughan et al. (2012) sample. MACSJ1423 has Chandra

bisector and represents the sequence on which X-ray and WL
masses would be equal. All values can be found in Table 3.

data but is also part of Guennou et al. (2014). The masses from
Guennou et al. (2014) are obtained by applying the Kravtsov
et al. (2006) scaling relation to the X-ray derived temperature
of the clusters. The error bars have been recomputed taking the
scatter of this scaling relation into account, since they were too
optimistic in Guennou et al. (2014). The masses from Chandra
observations have been computed in Lagan´a et al. (2013) using
both the temperatures and surface brightness proﬁles (see eq. 5
of the mentioned paper).

We compare in Fig. 7 the cluster masses inferred from X-
ray data and from WL, all computed in r500, for the ten clus-
ters that have both data. We see that the points are fairly dis-
tributed around the line of equality. Computing the lognormal
mean ratio of the WL to X-ray masses, we ﬁnd that WL masses
are 8% higher than the X-ray masses in the mean. Finding an
oﬀset is quite normal, as the X-ray masses rely on the assump-
tion that clusters are relaxed, which is generally not the case.
Weak lensing, on the other part, does not need such an assump-
tion, and WL masses are usually more reliable. An underesti-
mate of about 10 to 40% in the X-ray derived total cluster masses
is commonly observed (Rasia et al. 2006; Nagai et al. 2007;
Battaglia et al. 2013). We also note a departure from this rela-
tion for LCDCS0829, for which we cannot reproduce the high
X-ray mass, and for RXJ1716 which has a very low mass in
X-rays compared to its WL mass. In the ﬁrst case we note that
LCDCS0829 is highly asymmetrical as seen from its mass map
in Fig. 12 (Sect. 6). Hence, the hypothesis of spherical symmetry
that we made for our NFW ﬁt might explain why we ﬁnd a low
mass for this cluster. In general one can expect WL masses to be
very accurate for individual clusters, but only for a large sample
of clusters.

5.3. BCG and WL offset
In this section, we discuss the diﬀerence in the mass estimate
when centering on the BCG instead of the WL peak. Note that
we chose the latter center and apart from this section our WL
masses discussed in this paper are computed centered on the WL
peak.

First, using our simulated clusters (see Sect. 4.2) for diﬀer-
ent realizations of the noise, we measure the oﬀset between the
true input center and the highest WL peak. We ﬁnd a mean oﬀ-

11

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

set of 0.32 arcmin with a scatter of 0.20 arcmin. We use angu-
lar distances here because the noise comes from the background
galaxies. We can then say that using the BCG as the center of
mass of the cluster is a good approximation only if the oﬀset of
the BCG and the WL peak is lower than 0.52 arcmin (one sigma
above the mean oﬀset due to the noise). For each realization, we
also compute the mass centered on the true input center and on
the highest WL peak. We ﬁnd that centering on the WL peak
systematically overestimates masses by about 8% in the mean
with a scatter of 9%.

For clusters which have a well identiﬁed BCG, we then com-
pute the WL masses centered on the BCG in our data. The re-
sulting masses are shown in Table 4. We also plot one mass es-
timate against the other in Fig. 8. Table 4 displays the oﬀset be-
tween the BCG and the WL peak which can be high for some
clusters. The mean angular distance between the WL and BCG
centers is 0.67 arcmin, and ranges from 0.29 arcmin to 1.20 ar-
cmin. Note that we also display the BCG oﬀset in comoving dis-
tance in Table 4 to allow a comparison with the shear proﬁles that
are computed within comoving radii. The mean oﬀset between
the BCG and DM centers in comoving distance is 246 h−1
70 .kpc,
which is about 100 kpc higher than what is observed at lower
redshift (e.g. Oguri et al. 2010), and highlights the fact that our
clusters are mostly not relaxed and have probably suﬀered from
a complex merging history. According to our simulations, we
can distinguish between two populations of clusters. Those with
a BCG oﬀset lower than 0.52 arcmin and those with a larger oﬀ-
set. For the ﬁrst category, the BCG oﬀset is compatible with the
noise oﬀset. Thus the BCG center assumption is valid and the
masses centered on the BCG and the WL peak should agree. In
the second case, the BCG is likely not the center of mass of the
cluster, and masses centered on the BCG and on the WL peak
will signiﬁcantly disagree. Additionally, we verify that clusters
with small BCG oﬀsets are indeed not ongoing mergers, look-
ing at their convergence map. Only NEP200 presents signs of an
ongoing merger with two peaks in the WL reconstruction, and
is then counted in the merger category. We also note that the
BCG oﬀset for this cluster is very close to the acceptable limit.
These expectations are well met in Fig. 8, where we isolated the
two types of clusters. When identifying clusters that have their
BCG and WL peaks closer than 0.52 arcmin (red dots) we ﬁnd
that masses with the diﬀerent centers agree well within the error
bars. Note however that the error bars are not independent for
the two measurements as the shear at large radius will be largely
the same. The WL masses are still slightly higher when centered
on the WL peak because centering on the WL peak maximizes
the positive contribution of noise to the mass. Hence, choosing
the center the way we did tends to overestimate the mass in re-
laxed clusters compared to centering on the BCG. The masses
are lower by about 20% when centered on the BCG for this sub-
sample of clusters with small BCG oﬀsets, which is within the
error bars of our simulations. However, the mass diﬀerence is
signiﬁcantly larger for unrelaxed clusters (black dots) and can
be up to 60% lower in the case of signiﬁcant mergers (A851).

For about half of our sample, the BCG centering assump-
tion would then be correct here. However many of the clusters
in this sample have signiﬁcant merging activity and therefore the
BCG is likely not the center of mass of the cluster currently. In
addition, there are several clusters for which it is not possible to
identify the BCG, and using a diﬀerent center deﬁnition for these
clusters would bias the mass estimate in our sample. Therefore
we believe that our mass measurements are systematically high,
but centering on the BCG would create masses that are systemat-
ically low, and that would not be reliable in the case of mergers,

which a large fraction of our clusters are. A possibility would be
to use the BCG center when this assumption is valid and the WL
peak in the case of mergers, but we prefer to use the same center
(WL peak) for the whole sample to be able to compare masses
computed in the same way.

6. Environment
In this section, we use the 2D mass maps computed in Sect. 4.2
to discuss the structures detected in the vicinity of clusters. To
have a full understanding of the diﬀerent mass components we
overplot on the images the WL contours at a 3σ signiﬁcance as

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

well as the X-ray contours and the galaxy light distribution con-
tours. To secure the WL detection of each structure we compute
its signiﬁcance level with respect to the map noise for a hundred
realizations of the noise. We also count the percentage of simu-
lations in which the structure is detected at more than 3σ above
the background. The last two quantities contain similar informa-
tion, and are given in Table 5. The signiﬁcance levels in this table
are computed from the hundred realizations of the noise and can
slightly diﬀer from the contour levels shown in Figs. 9 to 23
which correspond to the original mass maps. We also compute
the number and signiﬁcance of peaks expected to be due to the
noise in the map reconstruction. This enables us to discuss the
presence of WL peaks which do not show any optical or X-ray
counterpart. We also note that in the case of the optical contours,
we tried to select only cluster member galaxies, while the WL is
sensitive to any line-of-sight structure, with a higher eﬃciency
for structures at redshift around z ∼ 0.3 − 0.4. As a result, it is
not surprising to ﬁnd some peaks in the convergence map with
no optical counterpart.

The X-ray contours are plotted from XMM–Newton EPIC
MOS1 or MOS2 images. The XMM images suit well our study,
as XMM has a larger ﬁeld of view than Chandra. However, when
no XMM data are available, we show contours from Chandra
images. Even with XMM, the ﬁeld of view is limited to about
30 arcmin in diameter, and in some cases, several structures de-
tected through weak lensing have no X-ray counterparts because
only the cluster vicinity is in the X-ray ﬁeld. The X-ray images
have been binned in squares of 64 pixels and then smoothed with
a Gaussian ﬁlter of 20 pixel width. The signiﬁcance of the X-ray
maps are computed from the dispersion of the values of the re-
spective map avoiding the cluster region, and start at 2σ. We
chose a 2σ value to show better how our WL detections are em-
bedded in the baryonic components, and because the X-ray maps
are only used for qualitative description.

The light density maps are built with the galaxies selected
to have a high probability of being at the same redshift as the
cluster. For this, we ﬁrst extract all the objects from the images
in two bands. We separate stars from galaxies and draw color-
magnitude diagrams. For each cluster, we superimpose on the
color-magnitude diagram the positions of the galaxies with spec-
troscopic redshifts coinciding with the cluster redshift range.
This allows to deﬁne the red sequence drawn by the early type
galaxies belonging to the cluster and to ﬁt it with a linear func-
tion of ﬁxed slope −0.0436, as in Durret et al. (2011). We then
select all the galaxies within ±0.3 magnitude of this sequence
as probable cluster members and compute the density map of
this galaxy catalog, using the same Gaussian kernel than that of
the WL analysis. The pixel size chosen to compute these maps
is 0.001 deg, and the number of bootstraps is 100. To derive the
signiﬁcance level of our detections, it is necessary to estimate the
mean background of each image and its dispersion. For this, we
draw for each density map the histogram of the pixel intensities.
We apply a 2.5σ clipping to eliminate the pixels of the image
that have high values and correspond to objects in the image.
We then redraw the histogram of the pixel intensities after clip-
ping and ﬁt this distribution with a Gaussian. For each cluster,
the mean value and the width of the Gaussian will respectively
give the mean background level and the dispersion, that we will
call σ. We then compute the values of the contours correspond-
ing to 3σ detections as the background plus 3σ. In all the ﬁgures
of the following subsection, we show contours starting at 3σ and
increasing by 1σ.

We ﬁrst discuss individually the mass map of every cluster
in Sect. 6.1, and then make general considerations in Sect. 6.2.

6.1. Individual clusters

In addition to discussing the reconstructed convergence maps,
in this subsection, we also compare the WL masses computed
from the NFW best ﬁt (see Sect. 4.3) to other masses from
the literature. However we would like to warn the reader that
WL masses from diﬀerent studies can signiﬁcantly vary. The
reason for that lies in the estimate of the redshift distribution
of the background galaxies. In the ideal case where every
study selects the same background galaxies and agrees on their
redshift distribution, they should get the same masses within
errors coming just from the shear measurement. However, in
most cases the selection of galaxies and the estimate of their
redshift distribution signiﬁcantly vary from one study to another,
introducing large diﬀerences on cluster masses. In addition,
cluster masses can present a bias, for example introduced by the
choice of a given value or range of value for the concentration
parameter, in order to break the mass-concentration degeneracy.
For large WL cluster surveys, masses thus diﬀer systematically
by 20-30% in comparing the masses of each cluster across the
survey. However the diﬀerent teams generally agree with each
other regarding which cluster are more massive.

XDCS0329, Fig. 9: XDCS0329 is barely detected, with a
signiﬁcance of only 2.8σκ. It possesses a weak X-ray and optical
counterpart. A larger structure is detected at the south with WL
(3: 3.9σκ) and could correspond to a structure at a diﬀerent
redshift from that of the cluster or to a fake peak but with a weak
probability given its signal-to-noise. The most massive structure
in this ﬁeld lies north west of the cluster (2: 5.6σκ), and does
not present any X-ray or optical detection. In addition there are
no known structure referenced at this position in NED, and its
high signiﬁcance detection cannot be reproduced by noise in the
mass map reconstruction. A spectroscopic survey of the area
would help determine the nature and redshift of this massive
object. Finally, we note that XDCS0329 is a small cluster given
= (2.9 ± 0.6) × 1014M(cid:12).h−1
its hydrodynamical mass of MX
70
500
found in Guennou et al. (2014). It is even sometimes consid-
ered as a group rather than a cluster (e.g., Mulchaey et al. 2006).

MACSJ0454, Fig. 10: MACSJ0454 has two substructures
detected in WL: a ﬁrst peak at 5.1σκ, and a second at 4.2σκ
deﬁning an elongated structure, as already reported from the
optical study of Kartaltepe et al. (2008). We note that these sub-
structures are not detected in the WL reconstruction of Soucail
et al. (2015), probably because they use a larger smoothing ker-
nel (θ = 150” against θ = 60” in our case). However, they found
a clear elongation that matches those substructures. The X-ray
and optical contours are centered between these two substruc-
tures, and elongated in their direction. The fact that this cluster
is highly substructured can explain why the NFW ﬁt fails. In ad-
dition, this cluster is probably of low mass as Zitrin et al. (2011)
= (0.41 ± 0.03) × 1014M(cid:12).h−1
found a central mass of MS L
70
500
in their strong lensing analysis. We also detect several faint
peaks. They are detected at levels of 4.4, 3.8, 4.2, and 4.0σκ
for structures 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. While structures 5
and 6 might have an optical counterparts, structure 4 and 7
very likely correspond to fake peaks, or to a small group at a
diﬀerent redshift for structure 4. Structures 4 and 6 are also
detected in Soucail et al. (2015). A larger structure is found at
the south west (8 at 5.5σκ), which is not at the cluster redshift,
given that it is not detected through the galaxy density contours,
but could also be due to a contamination from stars in its vicinity.

ABELL 851, Fig. 11: A851 is a massive cluster, detected
at a high signiﬁcance level (7.6σκ). It is highly sub-structured
as already found in Guennou et al. (2014), and conﬁrmed here
by the presence of three spatially separated components: the
dark matter, the X-ray gas, and the galaxies. No substructures
are detected in the mass reconstruction of Soucail et al. (2015),
but they used a smoothing kernel more than twice larger than
ours. The most important substructures are those noted 2 and
3, the ﬁrst to the south with a 5σκ signiﬁcance and the second
to the north-east with a 4.3σκ signiﬁcance. These structures

in X-rays, the contours of which are extended towards the
substructure directions. Finally, we note a fourth and a ﬁfth
structures, north-east and south-west of the cluster. These are
quite far from the cluster, and while 5 has an optical counterpart,
4 does not, and could either be a fake peak or a group at a
diﬀerent redshift. The 5th structure should lie at the same
redshift as the cluster. We note that other studies reported a
higher mass than the one we derived for this cluster. We ﬁnd

LCDCS0829, Fig. 12: LCDCS0829 is at ﬁrst view an
isolated cluster, with an elongation to the north-west. An
elongation is also detected in the WL reconstruction of Soucail

larger scale there is another structure (3: 4.7σκ) about 1.5-2 Mpc
south-west from the cluster, that could be in interaction, and
is detected both with WL and galaxy density. Farther away
but still at the same redshift according to our galaxy density
map lies a 4.5σκ structure (2) that could be a group connecting
to the main cluster through a ﬁlamentary structure passing
by 3, that remains to be detected. For this cluster we ﬁnd a
mass of MNFW
70 , which agrees
500
within the error bars with the WL study of Mahdavi et al.
(2013) (M500 = (9.3 ± 2.9) × 1014M(cid:12).h−1

terpart and only a faint optical counterpart. This means it
is a group or cluster, at a diﬀerent redshift from OC02. By
checking on NED, we ﬁnd that structure 2 corresponds in
fact to Abell 2246, a foreground cluster at z = 0.225. Finally,
OC02, also known as CL1701+6414 is a low mass cluster. We
ﬁnd a mass of MNFW
70 , slightly
500
higher than Israel et al. (2014), who found a WL mass of

500
depending on the chosen concentration parameter. We also
investigate the bias in the mass estimate from OC02’s shear
proﬁle due to the presence of the foreground cluster A2246.
To do this, we ﬁrst compute the expected shear proﬁle for the
foreground cluster, using an X-ray derived total mass from
Wang & Walker (2014): MX
70 , and
200
assuming a concentration parameter of c200 = 3.5. We note that
X-ray derived masses should not be biased by the proximity
of both clusters as they are derived in a much smaller region
than the WL. We then subtract this expected shear contribution
to every galaxy in the ﬁeld and compute again the mass of
OC02 by ﬁtting an NFW proﬁle to its new shear proﬁle. We
ﬁnd a new mass which is 7% lower than the value from Table 3.
We conclude that the presence of the foreground cluster only
weakly aﬀects the cluster mass estimate in this case, and do not
correct for it as it is low compared to the other sources of error,
and to avoid biasing our sample in applying a diﬀerent method
to one of our cluster.

NEP200, Fig. 15: NEP200 is detected in X-rays, optical,
and WL, with a detection signiﬁcance of 5.1σκ. It seems to be
merging with a companion on the west (2: 4.6σκ), while it is
probably a projection eﬀect given that it is not detected in the
optical contours. Spectroscopic redshifts would be needed to
conﬁrm this hypothesis. We also note several peaks at ∼ 3σκ
which could correspond to fake peaks or faint structures at dif-
ferent redshifts. As this cluster has not been widely studied yet,

of substructure 3 that could be a close group. Structures 1 and
2 are detected as a single structure in Soucail et al. (2015),
because of the larger smoothing scale they apply to the mass
map. Their reconstruction is clearly elongated in the direction
of these substructures. We note that Fo¨ex et al. (2012) found a

Several structures are also detected in the south, and are aligned
horizontally: 3 (4.8σκ), 4 (6.6σκ), 5 (4.7σκ), and 6. Structures 3
and 4, and also maybe 5, are detected in X-rays, while 4 and 6
have optical counterparts. Structures detected in WL and X-rays
have a high probability to be groups, while those detected
through the galaxy density maps should be around the same
redshift as CLJ0152. Given the extension of the galaxy density
map compared to that of the main cluster, structure 3 is probably
a foreground group. One possible explanation is that the cluster
recently underwent a merging event with the group 4 that
passed through CLJ0152 from the north-west to the south-east.
Structure 2 would be a remnant of this merging, while 3 should
not have taken part in that scenario. Also structure 6 could have
been created in the same event or being now interacting with
structure 4. An X-ray temperature map would be valuable to
check the direction of the past merger events.

detected at 3.9σκ in the south. However, this structure is not
detected in X-rays or in the galaxy density map, suggesting
that it is at a diﬀerent redshift, and therefore not in interac-
tion with RXJ2328. Note the presence of the Pegasus dwarf
galaxy in the south that has been masked in our analysis, but
could still bias our measurements. We ﬁnd a WL mass of

MACSJ0717, Fig. 18: MACSJ0717 is famous for being
one of the most massive clusters, as can be seen from its WL
contours, which reach a signiﬁcance of 10.9σκ. We note also
that it is strongly elongated towards a south east structure
noted 2 with a 8.2σκ signiﬁcance. Both structures are also
detected from the optical density map (as in Kartaltepe et al.
(2008)), suggesting that they are at the same redshift, but only
the main cluster is strongly emitting in X-rays. Structure 2 is
thus poor in hot gas, which makes us think that it corresponds
to a ﬁlament rather than a group which would have produced
more hot gas in its formation. The absence of a BCG agrees
with this idea. Structure 3 could also be a continuation of
this ﬁlament. Note that this ﬁlament has ﬁrst been studied
by Jauzac et al. (2012) from composite HST data, and later
by Medezinski et al. (2013). We compared our WL contours
with those from Jauzac et al. (2012), and found good agree-
ment. Concerning the mass of the cluster, Zitrin et al. (2011)
and Limousin et al. (2012) found strong lensing masses of

BMW1226, Fig. 19: This cluster is not detected through
WL, probably due to its high redshift: z = 0.89 which decreases
the number of background galaxies usable for the WL recon-
struction. However a large elongated structure (1) is detected,
and could be a ﬁlament linked to BMW1226. It is detected at
5.6σκ and has an optical counterpart, such that is should not be
too far from the cluster redshift. The small structure (2) west of
the cluster is not very signiﬁcant (2.9σκ) and is probably due to
the noise in the convergence map reconstruction. This cluster
has been studied by Jee & Tyson (2009) under its other name:
CLJ1226+3332. Using deep HST data, they manage to have
a suﬃcient number of background galaxies to reconstruct the
WL map around the cluster. However, the small ﬁeld of view of
the ACS camera does not allow them to study the ﬁlamentary

structure that we see east of the cluster.

MACSJ1423, Fig. 20: MACSJ1423 looks rather isolated on
small scales, with a good alignment between the WL, X-ray,
and optical centers. Kartaltepe et al. (2008) also classiﬁed it
as a relaxed cluster according to its optical contours. A small
structure is detected north-east from WL but not from the
optical data and should correspond to a group at a diﬀerent
redshift. The X-ray data come from Chandra in this case,
so structure 2 has no X-ray imaging. This cluster has been
studied in strong lensing by Zitrin et al. (2011) and also
by Limousin et al. (2010) who found a single central mass
component, which agrees with our smooth contours. Applegate
et al. (2014) also computed WL masses for this cluster ﬁnd-
ing values of MWL
70 or
MWL
70 , in the ﬁrst case using
the full distribution of photometric redshifts of the background
galaxies and in the second the standard color-color cut. We note
that our value of MNFW

good agreement with the one obtained with the color-color cut
method (the one which we used).

and could be embedded in a ﬁlament linking it to the cluster, as
suggested by the galaxy light density map. Note that structure 3
is also detected by von der Linden et al. (2014). An X-ray coun-
terpart is detected only for the cluster and not for structure 2, that
has then good chance of being part of the ﬁlament rather than
being an infalling group. The WL mass that we measure for this

70 . It is also detected in
500
the X-ray and galaxy density contours. CXOSEXSI2056 is
a smaller cluster detected at a 4.4σκ signiﬁcance, and also
presents an X-ray counterpart. It seems to be merging with a
wide structure (3: 4.5σκ) on the east and might also be linked to
the small structure 4 but the signiﬁcance of the latter structure
remains low (3.2σκ) and it is more likely a fake peak due to
noise. For this ﬁeld we did not try to estimate the masses of each
cluster by removing the contribution from the other, as we did
for OC02, because the signiﬁcance of their detections are too
diﬀerent. CXOSEXSI has little chance to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
shear proﬁle of MS2053, and on the contrary, removing such a
big cluster as MS2053 would introduce an other large bias in the
mass estimate of CXOSEXSI. In addition we did not compute
any mass for this latter cluster.

6.2. General discussion

We summarize the structure detection in Table 5, where we show
the average signiﬁcance of the WL detection obtained from 100
realizations of the noise along with the percentage of realizations
in which the structures are detected at more than 3σ above the
map noise deﬁned in eq. 6. We also indicate for each structure if
it has X-ray and optical counterparts, and conclude on the cur-
rent status of the cluster and the possible presence of ﬁlaments.
The ﬁrst conclusion from the study of this sample is that all
the clusters appear very diﬀerent, especially when considering
their close environment. Several hypotheses made for the mass
calculation are then questionable. Most of these clusters are not
spherical, and present either a preferential direction, or several
substructures. The NFW proﬁle used in Sect. 4.3 seems sim-
plistic compared to these results, and it appears very diﬃcult to
ﬁnd a mass proﬁle that ﬁts every cluster, when extending to radii
higher than the cluster core.

RXJ1716, Fig. 22: RXJ1716 (1: 7.3σκ) shows a very
elongated proﬁle pointing towards two groups: 2 and 3 detected
at respectively 4.9 and 5.4σκ. However those structures are
not detected in the galaxy density map and must then lie at a
diﬀerent redshift. The main cluster is also detected with the
X-ray and galaxy density contours. The elongated structure
to the north east of the cluster is also seen in the WL recon-
struction of Clowe et al. (1998). This is a massive cluster with

*CXOSEXSI J205617 and MS 2053.7-0449 are on the same image.

Despite these very diﬀerent behaviors, we try to classify our
sample according to the smoothness of their WL contours and
the presence of substructures or infalling groups:

(1) The only relaxed cluster of our sample is MACSJ1423.
On small scales we see smooth symmetrical contours and no
substructures. However, even for this cluster, we ﬁnd that it

might be embedded in at least one ﬁlamentary structure at larger
scales.

(2) The second category gathers clusters which are highly
asymmetrical but do not present any clear substructure or in-
falling group: LCDCS0829, RXJ1716, and MS2053. These clus-
ters are probably recovering from old merger events, the direc-
tion of interaction of which only remains visible.

Martinet et al.: Weak lensing study around high redshift clusters

We inverted the shear to obtain convergence maps, and over-
laid the WL contours on images. We estimated the signiﬁcance
of each detected structure with a hundred realizations with a ran-
dom ellipticity added to each galaxy. Comparing with X-ray con-
tours and galaxy light density contours, we studied the environ-
ment of every cluster. We found that clusters are very diﬀerent
on large scales and doubt they can all be ﬁtted with a simple
NFW proﬁle. We separated our sample between isolated relaxed
clusters, asymmetrical clusters with no substructures and clus-
ters which have a more complex environment. The second cate-
gory corresponds to past mergers and the third one to recent or
present mergers. Most of the sampled clusters are in the last two
categories, providing strong observational support to the hierar-
chical growth scenario, and implying that clusters are still evolv-
ing through this process at 0.4 < z < 0.9. Temperature maps
from deep X-ray imaging could help characterize the diﬀerent
merging phases that we observe (see e.g. Durret et al. 2011, and
references therein). Even in the isolated case, we found that clus-
ters are embedded in complex large scale structures, often con-
necting to another group on megaparsec scales. We report possi-
ble ﬁlament detections in CLJ0152, MACSJ0454, MACSJ0717,
A851, BMW1226, MS1621, and MACSJ1621, the ﬁrst one also
experiencing recent complex merger events. Finally, it is im-
portant to note that the distinction between a ﬁlament and an
infalling group or small cluster is almost a semantic problem.
However, groups and small clusters should contain more X-ray
gas than ﬁlaments, and are more likely to possess a BCG, at least
in the case of clusters. A more detailed study of each cluster with
separate simulations is required to help distinguish between the
two possibilities. We intend to study the galaxy populations of
the proposed ﬁlaments in the framework of the DAFT/FADA
survey, a work that will also help discriminating the nature of
these structures.

Fig. 23. Same as Fig 9 for MS2053 and CXOSEXSI2056 on the
r-band Subaru/Suprime-Cam image. We expect 1.3 fake peaks
above 3σκ and 0.2 above 4σκ in the displayed ﬁeld (see Sect. 4.2
for details).

(3) The last category encompasses clusters with high levels
of substructuring or apparent merging events. These clusters are
recovering from a recent merging event or even are presently
merging. Such behaviors are observed for MACSJ0454, A851,
MS1621, OC02, NEP200, RXJ2328, CLJ0152, MACSJ0717,
MACSJ1621, and CXOSEXSIJ2056.

Six clusters among this last

list seem to be part of
particularly intense extended structures: MACSJ0454, A851,
MS1621, CLJ0152, MACSJ0717, and MACSJ1621. In addition,
BMW1226 shows a large ﬁlament despite the fact that the cluster
is not detected itself. However, fainter elongated structures link-
ing the diﬀerent mass peaks can be seen in many cases as a result
of smoothing scale θS = 1 arcmin, suggesting that every cluster
lies in a large scale structure. These LSSs are often not clearly
detected, as they are too diﬀuse compared to the mass peaks cor-
responding to either infalling groups, or small merger events.
Finally, we note that most of our clusters are either past mergers
(∼ 21.5%) or recent or present mergers (∼ 71.5%). This sup-
ports the standard hierarchical scenario in which clusters grow
through the merging of smaller structures. In addition, it means
that most massive clusters at 0.4 < z < 0.9 are still evolving
through this merging process. XDCS0329 is not discussed as
it is only weakly detected. This classiﬁcation is summarized in
Table 5.

We

CFHT/MegaCam and seven Subaru/Suprime-Cam images.
We successfully estimated the mass of twelve clusters out of
sixteen, by ﬁtting their shear proﬁles with an NFW proﬁle.
Comparing with masses from X-ray data (XMM–Newton and
Chandra observations), we found that our masses are generally
higher than those from X-rays by about 8%, an expected
result given that the X-ray masses rely on the hypothesis of
hydrostatical equilibrium. However, our sample is small and we
need higher statistics to compare both masses, and also to better
compare to the WL literature.

Appendix A: Validating the PSF correction
In order to validate our PSF correction, we compute the auto cor-
relation functions of star ellipticities before and after correcting
for the PSF (Fig. A.1), and we also compare the auto correlation
function of the shear to the cross correlation function between
the galaxy corrected shears and the stellar ellipticities before
correction (Fig. A.2). Results are shown for MACSJ0717 and
RXJ2328 which respectively correspond to the Subaru/Suprime-
Cam and CFHT/Megacam data. The correlation functions are
computed using the ATHENA software (Kilbinger et al. 2014;
Schneider et al. 2002), from a 1 arcmin separation angle to 30
arcmin. C1 and C2 correspond to the rotated 1 and 2 compo-
nents, i.e., when taking the correlation between a given pair, C1
is comparing the shear that is tangential to the line connecting
the pairs and C2 is the 45 degree component.

Fig. A.1 shows that the PSF correction has reduced the star
ellipticity auto correlation function by about three orders of mag-
nitude both for the Suprime-cam and Megacam data. In addition,
we see in Fig. A.2 that the correlation between shear and stars is
consistent with zero and thus that the residual bias from the PSF
correction does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the shear, which shows
classical auto correlation functions.

Appendix B: Shear proﬁles
In this section we present the shear proﬁles for every cluster. See
Sect. 4.3 for details about how shear proﬁles are computed and
how the NFW ﬁt is performed.
