One–loop Standard Model observables produced by virtual heavy Kaluza–Klein ﬁelds play a
prominent role in the minimal model of universal extra dimensions. Motivated by this aspect,
we integrate out all the Kaluza–Klein heavy modes coming from the Yang–Mills theory set on
a spacetime with an arbitrary number, n, of compact extra dimensions. After ﬁxing the gauge
with respect to the Kaluza–Klein heavy gauge modes in a covariant manner, we calculate a gauge
independent eﬀective Lagrangian expansion containing multiple Kaluza–Klein sums that entail a
bad divergent behavior. We use the Epstein–zeta function to regularize and characterize discrete
divergences within such multiple sums, and then we discuss the interplay between the number of
extra dimensions and the degree of accuracy of eﬀective Lagrangians to generate or not divergent
terms of discrete origin. We ﬁnd that nonrenormalizable terms with mass dimension k are ﬁnite as
long as k > 4 + n. Multiple Kaluza–Klein sums of nondecoupling logarithmic terms, not treatable
by Epstein–zeta regularization, are produced by four–dimensional momentum integration. On the
grounds of standard renormalization, we argue that such eﬀects are unobservable.

INTRODUCTION

The formulation of a physical theory describing nature at the most fundamental level is one of the main incentives
behind investigations framed within high–energy physics. While experiments have set some hints [1] pointing towards
this aim, on the theoretical side there are many possibilities available. Among the vast collection of ideas, the
conjectural existence of compact extra dimensions [2–6] is the setup for the present work.

The exploration of Standard Model extensions with the ingredient of extra dimensions has been motivated by some
of the most intriguing questions nowadays. A world in which dark matter particles are part of the ﬁeld content of
Kaluza–Klein eﬀective theories has been widely investigated [7–18]. Studies of neutrino physics in extra–dimensional
contexts have been carried out as well, including the generation of neutrino masses [19–26] and the physics behind
neutrino oscillations [19, 20, 23, 27, 28]. The physics of the Higgs boson in extra–dimensional scenarios has been also
an object of study [29–43].

Among the diﬀerent models of extra dimensions, there is the formulation in which the whole Standard Model
is deﬁned in the extra–dimensional spacetime, where all the dynamic variables are allowed to propagate, so that
those particles included by the Standard Model in four dimensions are the lowest–energy manifestations of such
extra–dimensional ﬁelds, which describe nature at a higher–energy scale. This framework, commonly known as
universal extra dimensions [44], is the setting of the study performed in the present paper. Investigations centered
in the cosmological role of the lightest Kaluza–Klein particle [17, 45], a Kaluza–Klein Higgs boson [43, 46, 47], and
experimental data [48] from the Large Hadron Collider have provided upper bounds on the size of universal extra
dimensions, corresponding to energy scales that range around 1 TeV for the case of just one compact dimension.

The recent observation [49, 50] of a Higgs–like particle at the Large Hadron Collider is the last piece of the
realization that nature is governed by gauge symmetry.
In this context, the fate of extra–dimensional gauge
symmetry at the level of Kaluza–Klein theories becomes a matter of interest. From the four–dimensional viewpoint,
extra–dimensional gauge symmetry is split into two disjoint sets of transformations that have been termed the
standard gauge transformations and the nonstandard gauge transformations [51–53]. The set of standard gauge
transformations is a gauge subgroup that is identiﬁed with the gauge symmetry characterizing the four–dimensional
low–energy formulation, while the rest of the extra–dimensional gauge group, which corresponds to the nonstandard
gauge transformations, remains hidden [53]. With these ingredients, the quantization of Kaluza–Klein gauge theories
can be carried out [51]. One can take advantage of the mutual independence of the two four–dimensional sets of

2

gauge transformations and execute quantization while leaving four–dimensional gauge invariance untouched [51]. In
practice, the presence of this symmetry is convenient, for it introduces simpliﬁcations [54, 55] in calculations.

The Becchi–Rouet–Stora–Tyutin quantization [56–59] of gauge theories in ﬁve dimensions was detailed in a paper
by some of us [51]. Among the main points of that work, a four–dimensional set of SU(N, M4)–covariant gauge–ﬁxing
functions was proposed in order to maintain four–dimensional gauge invariance in the quantum Kaluza–Klein theory.
This was then utilized to integrate out [55] all the Kaluza–Klein excited modes and derive an eﬀective Lagrangian
featuring four–dimensional gauge invariance. In the present paper, we go further in this direction and perform such
calculation for the case of n extra dimensions. We resort to the results reported in Ref. [60], in which a full analysis
of the Kaluza–Klein Lagrangian generated by the n–dimensional Yang–Mills theory was performed. We ﬁnd that
a gauge independent result can be obtained by the delicate interplay of the contributions from the pure–gauge,
pseudo–Goldstone and ghost–antighost Kaluza–Klein sectors.

Nonrenormalizability of extra–dimensional formulations manifests in our results, which include multiple inﬁnite
Kaluza–Klein sums. Using a regularization scheme [61], which is based on the Epstein–zeta function [62–69], we
identify and isolate divergences that are inherent in such multiple sums. Our eﬀective Lagrangian expansion involves
nonrenormalizable terms whose mass–dimension is as large as 6. We determine that Kaluza–Klein sums in these
terms produce a divergence if the number of extra dimensions is greater than 1. Similarly to the general discussion
of Ref. [61], we ﬁnd that improvements in the accuracy of this eﬀective Lagrangian would modify the ultraviolet
behavior, by Kaluza–Klein sums, as long as the number of extra dimensions is large enough. Besides such discrete
divergences, there are terms in our eﬀective Lagrangian expansion that include standard divergences (short distance
eﬀects on the standard four–dimensional spacetime manifold) and nondecoupling logarithms that are aﬀected by
multiple Kaluza–Klein sums. Nevertheless, following previous results [61], we argue that these nondecoupling eﬀects
are unobservable, since they can be absorbed by the standard renormalization procedure, used to eliminate standard
divergences.

A complete and detailed study about the quantization of gauge theories comprising n extra dimensions is underway
and will be presented elsewhere [70]. Anyway, in the present paper we provide some advances on that matter,
including the tree–level couplings from the ghost–antighost sector that contribute to standard Green’s functions1 at
the one–loop level and a generalization to n extra dimensions of the Kaluza–Klein covariant gauge–ﬁxing functions
given in Ref. [51]. A simple relation among one–loop contributions from Kaluza–Klein pseudo–Goldstone bosons and
those from the ghost–antighost sector is observed, which also occurs in ﬁve dimensions [54, 55].

This document has been organized in the following way: we develop a brief discussion on the Kaluza–Klein model
in Section II, which includes the mass–spectrum of the Kaluza–Klein scalars and the Kaluza–Klein couplings that
are necessary to carry out the main calculation; then, in Section III, we provide some results on the quantization of
the Kaluza–Klein theory; Section IV is dedicated to the integration of the Kaluza–Klein excited modes, covering the
proof of gauge independence and the Epstein–zeta regularization of divergences from Kaluza–Klein sums; ﬁnally, in
Section V, we give a summary of the paper.

II. TREE–LEVEL KALUZA–KLEIN COUPLINGS CONTRIBUTING AT ONE LOOP

Theoretical aspects of ﬁeld theories in extra dimensions have been considered in diverse works [5, 44, 51, 53, 60, 71–
79]. In this section, we provide some results that are necessary ingredients to perform the main calculation of the
paper. In what follows, we use the notation of Refs. [60, 61], where fully detailed discussions on all these results can
be found.

We begin by assuming that, at some high–energy scale, spacetime looks like a plane manifold, M4+n, comprising 4+
n dimensions and being characterized by a Minkowski–like metric, gMN = diag(1, −1, . . . , −1). Uppercase indices run
over all the spacetime coordinates, so that M, N = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . , 4+n. Any ﬁeld formulation nested in this spacetime
will be governed by the extra–dimensional Poincar´e group ISO(1, 3 + n). We also assume that all ﬁelds propagate in
the whole spacetime, so that they are functions of (4 + n)–vector coordinates (x, ¯x) = (x0, x1, x2, x3, ¯x5, . . . , ¯x4+n).

1 Throughout the paper we use the term standard Green’s function to refer to any Green’s function generated by loop diagrams in which

all external legs are Kaluza–Klein zero modes.

given in terms of extra–dimensional gauge ﬁelds, which are denoted by Aa
M (x, ¯x) and which deﬁne the Yang–Mills
curvatures as F a
N (x, ¯x). Here, the g4+n is the
SU(N, M4+n) coupling constant, with dimensions (mass)−n/2, and f abc represents the structure constants of the
gauge group. Lowercase indices correspond to the gauge group, which means that a = 1, 2, . . . , N 2 − 1.

So far, experiments have not found any evidence [1, 48] pointing to the actual existence of extra dimensions, which
can be explained as long as these extra dimensions are small enough. The transition of the LYM(x, ¯x) Lagrangian
from the extra–dimensional manifold M4+n to the four–dimensional perspective is implemented [61] by two canonical
transformations. The ﬁrst of such transformations maps covariant objects of ISO(1, 3 + n) into ISO(1, 3)–covariant
objects: extra–dimensional vector gauge ﬁelds Aa
µ(x, ¯x), with µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
and a set of ISO(1, 3) scalars Aa
¯µ(x, ¯x), in which ¯µ = 5, 6, . . . , 4 + n. This transformation maintains invariance
under the extra–dimensional Poincar´e group, though keeping it hidden and only showing manifest invariance with
respect to ISO(1,3). As we consider lower energies, the compact structure of extra dimensions becomes apparent and
the extra–dimensional Poincar´e group ISO(1, 3 + n) is explicitly broken by compactiﬁcation. We assume that the
resulting spacetime is M4 × N n, where M4 represents the standard four–dimensional spacetime and the submanifold
N n = (S1/Z2)n stands for all compact dimensions, whose radii are R1, R2, . . . , Rn. With this structure of the
compact extra dimensions, the gauge ﬁelds Aa
M (x, ¯x + 2πR),
and parity properties, Aa
M (x, ¯x), as well. The implementation in the LYM(x, ¯x) Lagrangian of
the explicit breaking of the extra–dimensional Poincar´e group ISO(1,3 + n) is carried out by [53, 61] a second
canonical transformation, which turns out to be Fourier expansions of the Aa
M (x, ¯x) ﬁelds that are consistent with
the periodicity and parity properties adopted by them. These expansions are commonly known as Kaluza–Klein
towers.

M (x, ¯x) acquire periodicity properties, Aa

M (x, −¯x) = ±Aa

µ(x, −¯x) = +Aa

After using the aforementioned Fourier series, all dependence on the extra–dimensional coordinates of the
Yang–Mills Lagrangian LYM(x, ¯x), Eq. (1), can be integrated out, which generates a four–dimensional eﬀective
theory, L4YM(x), whose dynamic variables are the Kaluza–Klein modes. To make sure that the low–energy limit of
L4YM(x) is just the Yang–Mills theory in four dimensions the correct parity conditions for the extra–dimensional
ﬁelds are Aa

(x), and (2n − 1)(N 2 − 1)
are excited modes, A(k1,...,kn)a
(x). For excited modes, the Kaluza–Klein indices k1, . . . , kn are nonnegative integer
numbers, but the case in which all of these indices are simultaneously zero is excluded, for it corresponds to zero
modes. The zero modes are recognized as the dynamic variables of the low–energy theory, and consistently they
behave as gauge ﬁelds with respect to the standard gauge transformations. The ISO(1,3) scalars Aa
¯µ(x, ¯x), on the
other hand, are decomposed into n (2n − 1)(N 2 − 1) scalar Kaluza–Klein modes, A(k1,...,kn)a
(x). Again, the only
combination of Kaluza–Klein indices that is excluded is (0, . . . , 0).

The general case of n extra dimensions brings intricate expressions, which are diﬃcult to read. For this reason,
a convenient notation, which evokes intuition and directly generalices the results of the ﬁve–dimensional case [51] is
desirable. To this aim, we deﬁne (0) = (0, . . . , 0), which we use to express zero modes more brieﬂy as A(0,...,0)a
(x) =
A(0)a
(x). We represent all other possible arrangements of Kaluza–Klein indices (k1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , kn),
(k1, k2, 0 . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, kn−1, kn), . . . , (k1, . . . , kn) generically by (k), so that Kaluza–Klein excited modes are
compactly denoted by A(k)a

(x). Then, we use the sum [60, 61]

M (x, ¯x) deﬁning it, speciﬁc period-
icity and parity transformation properties with respect to the extra coordinates, which means that it can also be
expanded in Kaluza–Klein towers. The implementation of the ﬁrst canonical transformation in the extra–dimensional
Lagrangian LYM(x, ¯x) separates the extra–dimensional curvature into three components that possess deﬁnite trans-
formation properties under ISO(1, 3), that is, FMN (x, ¯x) → Fµν (x, ¯x), Fµ¯ν(x, ¯x), F¯µ¯ν (x, ¯x), with Fµν(x, ¯x) being a
2–tensor, Fµ¯ν(x, ¯x) transforming as a vector, and F¯µ¯ν (x, ¯x) behaving as an ISO(1,3) scalar. The second canonical
transformation, corresponding to the Kaluza–Klein towers, produces a set of Kaluza–Klein excitations for each of
these components, which are given in terms of the Kaluza–Klein modes of the extra–dimensional gauge ﬁelds as [60]

with the underlining of kα indicating that kα can be either zero or a natural number, which depends on the zero and
nonzero Kaluza–Klein indices in any concrete combination (k) that we take in m¯µ(k). Some of these Kaluza–Klein
modes include the objects ∆(nrk) and ∆′
(nrk). While their precise deﬁnitions, given in terms of Kronecker deltas, can
be found in Ref. [60], it is worth commenting that in what follows we do not consider any term in which they appear.
The reason is that couplings that incorporate these objects do not contribute at the one–loop level to standard
Green’s functions, but since higher orders.

It turns out that the Kaluza–Klein Lagrangian is expressed in terms of the Kaluza–Klein modes of the curvature

in a relatively simple manner. The precise expression reads [60]

In the next two subsections we extract from Eq. (9) all those Kaluza–Klein couplings that contribute to standard
Green’s functions at one loop.

A. Kaluza–Klein scalars and mass spectrum

The emergence of Kaluza–Klein scalar modes, after compactiﬁcation,

is an interesting characteristic of the
SU(N, M4+n) theory.
(x) is
N 2 − 1, which exactly matches the number of Kaluza–Klein gauge modes A(k)a
(x). Remarkably, the gauge excited
modes are massive, even though they originate from massless ﬁve–dimensional gauge ﬁelds. The scalar Kaluza–Klein

modes behave like pseudo–Goldstone bosons in the sense that they are massless and can be eliminated from the
theory by a speciﬁc gauge transformation [51], just like if they had given their physical degrees of freedom to the
excited Kaluza–Klein gauge ﬁelds. With the assumption of more extra dimensions the analysis grows in diﬃculty,
although the same mechanism for generation of gauge masses2 takes place [60, 61]. Some complications in the scalar
sector arise because for n > 1 extra dimensions the number of Kaluza–Klein scalars is greater than the number of
Kaluza–Klein gauge modes. Another diﬃculty is introduced by the presence of mixings among some of the scalar
Kaluza–Klein modes. The whole set of n(2n − 1)(N 2 − 1) Kaluza–Klein scalars can be split into two types of ﬁelds,
according to whether or not they participate in such scalar mixings: n 2n−1(N 2 − 1) Kaluza–Klein scalars mix,
whereas n(2n−1 − 1)(N 2 − 1) do not take part in mixings. All this information is enclosed by the ﬁfth term of the
right–hand side of Eq. (9).

The ﬁfth term of Eq. (9) can be written as

The only term explicitly shown in the right–hand side of the last equation comprises a set of n × n mixing matrices,
(k)
¯µ¯ν , each of which corresponds to a ﬁxed combination of Kaluza–Klein indices in the sum over (k). All the information
M
concerning Kaluza–Klein scalar mixings is contained in these matrices, with components concisely expressed as

(11)

This is the structure of the inertia tensor associated to a single massive particle located at rT(k) = (p(k)
4+n).
The shape of any mixing matrix is determined by the number of nonzero Kaluza–Klein indices in the combination
(k) that distinguishes it: the number of mixed Kaluza–Klein scalars matches the number of nonzero Kaluza–Klein
indices, whereas all the remaining, and unmixed, scalars have deﬁnite mass,

indices, so that the precise structure of each M(k) clearly depends on its corresponding combination (k). A detailed
description of the speciﬁc mixing pattern followed by the set of Kaluza–Klein scalars has been carried out in Ref. [60].

Of course, scalar mixing can be eradicated from the Kaluza–Klein theory by diagonalizing the mixing matrices

them being equal to m2

the Kaluza–Klein theory is (2n − 1)(N 2 − 1), each one providing one massless scalar A(k)a
G . Hence, the total number
of massless scalars is (2n − 1)(N 2 − 1), which consistently coincides with the number of gauge Kaluza–Klein excited
modes A(k)a

In our notation, any matrix M(k) with primed indices ¯µ′, ¯ν′ (= 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, G) is a diagonal matrix, contrastingly to

B. Kaluza–Klein couplings

Now that we have discussed the pure–scalar sector of the Kaluza–Klein theory, we proceed to set apart from L4YM
all those couplings that contribute to standard Green’s functions through one–loop diagrams and which are thus
necessary for the integration of the Kaluza–Klein excited modes. An exhaustive catalog of Kaluza–Klein couplings,
in the general context of the full extra–dimensional Standard Model, can be found in Ref [61].

From the expression of the zero mode F (0)a

µν , exhibited in Eq. (3), it is clear that the ﬁrst term of Eq. (9) includes
the four–dimensional Yang–Mills Lagrangian, deﬁned in terms of the four–dimensional Yang–Mills curvature F (0)a
and which we denote by L(0)

4YM. We express this term as

Besides the low–energy theory, this equation shows explicitly a term contributing at one loop to standard Green’s
functions. Ellipsis, on the other hand, represents couplings whose lowest–order contributions to such Green’s functions
enter at the two–loop level. Another term generating pure–gauge interactions within L4YM is the third one, which we
write as

The second term of Eq. (9) produces only quartic interactions of Kaluza–Klein excited modes, so we omit it and
pass to the Kaluza–Klein gauge–scalar interactions that are situated in the fourth term of this equation. This term
can be expressed as

holds for any combination (k). This yields an exact cancellation of most gauge–scalar couplings in this term, in
which the only Kaluza–Klein scalars that survive the rotation R(k)
¯ν ¯ν ′, and thus participate in such gauge–scalar cou-
plings, are the pseudo–Goldstone bosons A(k)a
G . Before compactiﬁcation, the interactions among components of the
extra–dimensional gauge vector ﬁeld Aa
M (x, ¯x) are explicitly governed by the extra–dimensional SU(N, M4+n) gauge
symmetry group. Once the compactness of extra dimensions is implemented in the Lagrangian by the aforementioned
canonical transformations, and extra–dimensional gauge invariance is hidden, there emerge the Kaluza–Klein excited
gauge modes A(k)a
as well. After the explicit breaking of the ISO(1, 3 + n) group takes
place, the couplings of extra–dimensional gauge ﬁelds evolve into the couplings and mass terms characterizing the
four–dimensional formulation. In particular, a link between gauge excited modes A(k)a
and a subset of the Kaluza–
Klein scalar spectrum is developed. Such link, which manifests through the generation of gauge masses for the gauge
excited modes A(k)a
G , also selectively allows the presence of bilinear
gauge–scalar couplings: the only Kaluza–Klein scalars that bilinearly couple to Kaluza–Klein gauge modes are the
pseudo–Goldstone bosons A(k)a
G , while such interactions are exactly eliminated for the rest of the scalar spectrum. As
we show later, a convenient set of gauge–ﬁxing functions allows us to trade the only existing gauge–scalar bilinear
couplings by gauge–dependent mass terms for the pseudo–Goldstone bosons A(k)a

III. ASPECTS OF QUANTIZATION

Gauge symmetry is a profound concept [80–83] that characterizes successful and accurate physical formulations,
realized within ﬁeld theory, that are aimed to the quantum description of nature. The essence of gauge invariance
is an overdescription that consists in the incorporation of more degrees of freedom than those which are strictly
necessary to describe a given physical system. While this symmetry manifests as the invariance of Lagrangians under
gauge transformations, the Dirac’s algorithm [80] dives into the depths of this concept and even provides tools to
determine [84] the corresponding gauge transformations. This instrument was used in Refs. [51, 53] to develop a
careful and complete study of gauge symmetry in the context of extra–dimensional gauge theories. Kaluza–Klein
eﬀective descriptions that originate in gauge extra–dimensional theories are invariant under two disjoint sets of gauge
transformations: the standard gauge transformations, with respect to which the zero modes A(0)a
behave as gauge
ﬁelds; and the nonstandard gauge transformations, which transform the Kaluza–Klein excited vector modes A(k)a
as
gauge ﬁelds. While there are two types of transformations that are independent of each other, it is indeed the full
extra–dimensional gauge group the one which governs the interactions of the Kaluza–Klein Lagrangian. Nevertheless,
the sets of canonical transformations that take the extra–dimensional Lagrangian LYM into the Kaluza–Klein theory
L4YM hide [53] gauge symmetry living in extra dimensions, in such a way that the ordinary four–dimensional world
displays explicit invariance only under the SU(N, M4) group.

µ

µ

Though gauge symmetry is usually evoked to construct models, the quantization process by path integral
requires [83] this overdescription to be removed. The framework to execute the quantization of gauge systems is
provided by the ﬁeld–antiﬁeld formalism [59, 85–89] and the Becchi–Rouet–Stora–Tyutin symmetry [56–58], better
known as the BRST symmetry. The main point is the determination of a proper solution to the master equation,
which arises after a series of extensions of the ﬁeld spectrum are carried out. In particular, the ghost and antighost
ﬁelds are introduced, and a set of auxiliary ﬁelds enter the game as well. The resulting set of ﬁelds is then doubled by
introducing an antiﬁeld per each ﬁeld, and a symplectic structure, known as the antibracket, is deﬁned. The proper
solution turns out to be the generator of the BRST transformations, which include, as a particular case, the gauge
transformations. In this context, the ﬁxation of the gauge, intended to remove all degeneracy associated to gauge
symmetry, is carried out in a nontrivial manner. This is accomplished by deﬁning a fermionic functional that is used
to eliminate all the aforementioned antiﬁelds and collaterally ﬁx the gauge. The main outcome of this procedure is
the derivation of a quantum action that depends on general gauge–ﬁxing functions. At this level, gauge symmetry is
no longer present and the system is properly quantized.

The quantization of Yang–Mills theories in ﬁve spacetime dimensions has been carried out [51] in this approach.
The simplest strategy [51, 70] consists in generalizing the well–known proper solution that corresponds [59] to the
four–dimensional version of this formulation to the case in which there exist extra dimensions. The transition to
the four–dimensional perspective gives rise to a richer Kaluza–Klein theory that now includes, besides the L4YM
Lagrangian, gauge–ﬁxing and ghost–antighost sectors. Since the two coexisting sets of four–dimensional gauge
transformations are independent of each other, it is possible to remove only [51, 70] invariance under the nonstandard
gauge transformations. In such manner, the four–dimensional SU(N, M4) symmetry is still valid and the zero modes

8

µ

A(0)a
are still gauge ﬁelds, similarly to what happens, for instance, with the background ﬁeld method [90–100]. In
practice, this is achieved by introducing [51, 70] an ad hoc set of gauge–ﬁxing functions that are SU(N, M4)–covariant.
This modus operandi to ﬁx the gauge has been of beneﬁt in phenomenological calculations [101] framed within other
formulations, such as the 331 model [102, 103]. In a forthcoming paper [70], this picture will be discussed in full
detail. However, since the present paper requires some results concerning the quantum version of the Kaluza–Klein
theory from Yang–Mills in n extra dimensions, we provide here all indispensable expressions for the main calculation.

In the (4 + n)–dimensional case, the quantization procedure sketched above generates a quantum Kaluza–Klein
Lagrangian, LQKK, that can be split into a sum of three parts as LQKK = L4YM + LGF + LG, where LGF is the
gauge–ﬁxing term, deﬁned completely by the gauge–ﬁxing functions, here denoted by f (k)a. The LG term represents
the sector of ghost and antighost ﬁelds, and is determined in part by the election of the gauge–ﬁxing functions.
Diﬀerent sets of these functions have been propounded [74, 75, 79] for the case of just one extra dimension. We
generalize the proposal of Ref. [51], given for the framework of one extra dimension, and provide the following set of
SU(N, M4)–covariant gauge–ﬁxing functions, which is suitable for n extra dimensions:

where ξ is the gauge–ﬁxing parameter, whose diﬀerent values correspond to diﬀerent choices of the gauge. Using these
functions, the gauge–ﬁxing term can be written as

f (k)a = D(0)abµA(k)b

The second term of the right–hand side of this equation cancels the only gauge–scalar couplings allowed by the
theory, that is, those involving the pseudo–Goldstone bosons A(k)a
and which arise from Eq. (19). We will proﬁt
from this cancellation later, when we integrate out the Kaluza–Klein excited modes.
In general, simpliﬁcations
are introduced by the elimination of these couplings because it reduces the number of Feynman diagrams in any
calculation aimed to derive contributions to some standard Green’s function. Since this cancellation was produced
by the introduction of covariant gauge–ﬁxing functions, it is clear that the resulting simpliﬁcations are a direct
consequence of the preservation of gauge symmetry. In other words, the presence of symmetries come along with
simpliﬁcations in phenomenological calculations. However, as the third term of Eq. (22) shows, the removal of such
unphysical couplings leaves, as a remnant, an unphysical mass term for these spurious scalar degrees of freedom. In
the Feynman–’t–Hooft gauge, deﬁned by the condition ξ = 1, these masses coincide with those of the Kaluza–Klein
gauge excited modes. The ﬁrst and third terms in Eq. (22) contribute to light Green’s functions since the one–loop
level and thus are relevant for the present calculation.

G

The ghost–antighost–ﬁelds term, LG, involves several couplings of Kaluza–Klein ghost ﬁelds, C(k)a, and antighost
ﬁelds, ¯C(k)a, with gauge and scalar Kaluza–Klein modes. After inserting the covariant gauge–ﬁxing functions, only
two types of these couplings contribute to standard Green’s functions at one loop. One of them is a gauge–dependent
mass term, whereas the other one is a kinetic term.

We end this section by showing the whole set of couplings that we shall consider in the integration of heavy

IV. GAUGE–INDEPENDENT INTEGRATION OF KALUZA–KLEIN EXCITATIONS

In this section, we carry out the functional integration of all the Kaluza–Klein excited modes and derive the
ﬁrst nonrenormalizable terms [104, 105] of an eﬀective Lagrangian expansion governed by the low–energy dynamic

variables and symmetries. To this end, we follow the procedure devised by the authors of Ref. [106], which was
adjusted and implemented, in Ref. [55], to the integration of heavy Kaluza–Klein modes from Yang–Mills theories
with one extra dimension.

We begin by deﬁning the eﬀective action, Seﬀ , by

Before following through, some explanation on this equation is opportune. The symbol Tr stands for a trace over all
degrees of freedom, including spacetime points. Each trace Tr acts also on matrices that live in diﬀerent spaces and
coexist within the arguments of the logarithms in the diﬀerent terms, where they multiply each other. For example,
look at the second term of the right–hand side of Eq. (25). One way of making sense of the argument of its logarithm is
by imagining its terms as (N 2 − 1) × (N 2 − 1) block matrices, which come from the gauge group and whose entries are
blocks of size 4 × 4, because of the spacetime indices. This means that, for instance, D(0) is the SU(N, M2) covariant
derivative in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and in matrix form, and 1N is the (N 2 − 1) × (N 2 − 1)
identity matrix in this gauge–group space, whereas gµν is the 4 × 4 matrix corresponding to the inverse of the metric
tensor. This term of Eq. (25) contains all the contributions from the Kaluza–Klein gauge excited modes A(k)a
and, as
it can be appreciated, is gauge dependent, since it carries the gauge–ﬁxing parameter ξ. The third and fourth terms
of this equation are scalar contributions from physical scalars A(k)a
G , respectively,
and the ﬁfth term comprehends all contributions from ghost and antighost ﬁelds, C(k)a and ¯C(k)a. Note that the global
negative sign within the logarithm of the ghost–sector contribution can be relegated to the zero–point energy. The
resulting expression is proportional to the fourth term, which comes from the Kaluza–Klein pseudo–Goldstone modes
A(k)a
G . Clearly, the ghost–antighost contributions are minus twice times those produced by the pseudo–Goldstone
bosons. This relation, which had already been noticed in the 331 model [101] and in the ﬁve–dimensional Yang–Mills
theory [55], is a direct consequence of our set of gauge–ﬁxing functions and illustrates the simpliﬁcations supported
by the presence of gauge symmetry. This result is general, within this gauge–ﬁxing prescription, and remains the
same in any one–loop calculation. Of course, both of these unphysical contributions are gauge dependent. Finally, we
point out that the argument of the logarithm of the third term includes the object 1n−1, which is an identity matrix
of size (n − 1) × (n − 1) that appears because of the presence of n − 1 physical scalars A(k)a
per each combination (k)
and per each value of the gauge index a.

A. The gauge trace

In this subsection, we derive a result that is not exclusive of Kaluza–Klein theories, but also applies in other gauge
formulations. For that reason, only for now we change our notation to avoid any reference to the particular case of
extra–dimensional models. Inspired by the method of Ref. [106], and following the Appendix of Ref. [55], we consider
a generic trace of the form

where D is the covariant derivative, which we assume to be in some representation of a gauge group SU(N ), m is
some high–energy scale, and Uµν = U a
µνT a is an arbitrary block matrix function of spacetime coordinates whose

i Tr loghgµν (−D2 − m2) − Uµνi,

(26)

entries are 4 × 4 matrices. Here, the T a matrices are the generators of the gauge group in whatever representation
we choose. As suggested by the authors of Ref. [106], we use the notation Aµ ≡ −igT aAa
µ, so that the covariant
derivative reads Dµf (x) = ∂µf (x) + [Aµ, f (x)] and the deﬁnition of the Yang–Mills curvature, Fµν = −igT aF a
µν , has
the simple form [Dµ, Dν] = Fµν .

Our objective is to solve the trace given in Eq. (26) and so derive an eﬀective expansion, L, of the form

The procedure involves momentum integrals, which produce ultraviolet divergences. To handle them, we use the
dimensional regularization approach [107], for which the dimension of spacetime is set as D, with D → 4, and a
mass scale µ, with units of mass, is introduced to correct units in momentum integrals. The Ok,b, in Eq. (27),
are ﬁeld operators whose dimensions are (mass)2k, and nk is the total number of such operators for a ﬁxed k.
In the present study we are concerned with eﬀective operators with mass dimensions as large as six, that is, up to k = 3.

In this method [55, 106], two partial answers are obtained by diﬀerent means and they are then put together in a
particular context to determine the general solution. For the ﬁrst piece, essentially, one has to guess which will be
the general structure of the ﬁnal result. Though the whole set of SU(N )–invariant operators of mass dimensions 4
and 6 is well known [104, 105], the presence of the general object Uµν complicates this task. The authors of Ref. [106]
provided a set of operators which works well in the absence of matrices associated to the Lorentz group (which we
have represented by means of Lorentz indices). Fortunately, gauge independence sheds light on what to expect from
Eq. (26), as we shall appreciate when we implement the ﬁnal result to the Kaluza–Klein gauge theory. According to
this criterion, the correct set for k = 1, 2, 3 is

with the symbol trr denoting a trace acting on matrices from the SU(N ) representation in which we are working.

For the second piece, we use the expressions of Ref. [51], according to which the trace in Eq. (26) can be written,

in terms of a Lagrangian L, as

with

(32)

(33)

To get this expression for the Lagrangian L, the trace over those degrees of freedom that correspond to points of
spacetime has been taken, so that in L the trace Tr does not appear. Instead, it involves the trace tr, which acts on
all the discrete matrices within the momentum integral. These are block matrices of size determined by the gauge
group representation, with entries of size 4 × 4. The symbol 1, on the other hand, indicates that operators act on the

identity. We have also used the deﬁnition [106] Πµ = i Dµ.

After solving the integrals for diﬀerent values of k in the series given in Eq. (33), one should get, with the desired
accuracy, the eﬀective Lagrangian expansion shown in Eq. (27), with all the coeﬃcients γk,b established exactly. The
bunch of technical diﬃculties that may emanate in a calculation of such nature [108] was attenuated by the authors
of Ref. [106], who cleverly conceived a shortcut that renders the calculation of the ﬁrst nonrenormalizable terms a
relatively easy task. While they compared their results and found agreement with other works [109], we will show
below that this method works well enough to yield gauge independent results. As we mentioned already, we will
follow dimensional regularization [107] to deal with ultraviolet divergences. To this end, we carry out the replacement
d4p/(2π)4 → µ4−DdDp/(2π)D in momentum integrals.

11

For the next step, we connect our ingredients: 1) our conjectured ﬁeld–operator combinations, Eqs. (29–31); and
2) Eq. (33), which is a partial calculation of the eﬀective Lagrangian expansion L. The idea is that both of these
expressions are valid for any ﬁeld conﬁguration. In particular, the coeﬃcients γk,b are constant numbers [110], which
remain the same in any ﬁeld conﬁguration and for any choice of the matrix Uµν . We take a particular conﬁguration

with α = 1 − 1/ξ. Written in this form, this gauge trace has an eﬀective Lagrangian expansion that ﬁts Eq. (41). It is
very important to keep in mind that the replacement Fµν → −igF a
µνT a = −igFµν has to be done in L before puting
this result into eﬀect. The ﬁrst, second and third terms of Eq. (41) involve divergencies, within the ∆ǫ factor, and
logarithms that in MS–like renormalization schemes, such as MS, become nondecoupling. Due to antisymmetry of
the Yang–Mills curvature F (0)a
µν , with respect to Lorentz indices, the ﬁrst and second terms of Eq. (41) vanish exactly
when this result is implemented to the gauge trace given in Eq. (43). The third term, on the other hand, survives,
but its divergent and nondecoupling eﬀects are unobservable. As it is discussed in Ref. [61], despite the presence of
multiple and inﬁnite Kaluza–Klein sums, this term is absorbed by means of the standard renormalization procedure.
Omitting divergent and nondecoupling terms, and assuming that nonrenormalizable terms of mass–dimension 6 are
much larger than terms of higher orders, we ﬁnd that the eﬀective Lagrangian emerging from the pure–gauge Kaluza–
Klein contributions reads

where, again, we have neglected terms of mass–dimensions larger than 6. As we did in the case of the gauge trace,
here we have omitted terms that are proportional to the trace of Fµν F µν , for they can be absorbed by renormalization
and are thus unobservable [61]. The only sources of gauge dependence are the contributions from Kaluza–Klein gauge
excited modes, pseudo–Goldstone bosons, and ghost and antighost Kaluza–Klein ﬁelds. As it can be appreciated from
Eqs. (44) and (45), the contributions from the gauge excited modes diﬀer from those generated by unphysical scalars
and ghost–antighost ﬁelds by gauge dependent global factors. When these contributions are all added together these
global factors are summed like

This explicitly demonstrates that the eﬀective Lagrangian expansion resulting from integrating out all the Kaluza–
Klein excited modes is gauge independent, which is achieved by a ﬁne cancellation between all gauge dependent
contributions.

Both nonrenormalizable terms in this result involve a factor N , which distinguishes gauge group. This method to
derive eﬀective Lagrangians by the integration of heavy degrees of freedom produced SU(N, M4)–invariant operators
with traces over generators in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. This can be appreciated, for instance,
in Eq (44), which is written in terms of the trace tra. Nevertheless, we have written the total contribution to Leﬀ in
terms of the trace trf , which represents a trace over generators in the fundamental representation. In other words,
we have replaced Fµν = F a
f represents the SU(N, M4) generators in the fundamental
representation, and this change has come along with the previously mentioned factor N . Our result also depends on
the number n of extra dimensions. Explicit dependence comes from the contribution of physical scalars A(k)
¯n , which
involves a global factor (n − 1) that adds to factors from all other contributions to produce the (n + 2) that appears in
Eq. (47). Dependence on the number of extra dimensions is also implicitly located within the sum over combinations

C. Regularization of multiple Kaluza–Klein sums and ﬁnal result

In general, ultraviolet divergences are induced by loop calculations, though renormalizable formulations set
the conditions to get rid of them. The ultraviolet comportment of loop contributions from Kaluza–Klein excited
modes features, besides usual divergences, multiple inﬁnite Kaluza–Klein sums that often produce divergent results.
Continuous divergences, from integration of 4–momenta, and discrete divergences, from Kaluza–Klein sums, share a
common origin. Discrete divergences arise from the split of extra–dimensional momentum, whose components along
the extra dimensions get quantized by compactiﬁcation, producing Kaluza–Klein sums over Kaluza–Klein masses. In
the very special case of only one extra dimension, these sums are [55, 60, 61] ﬁnite Riemann–zeta functions, but as
more extra dimensions are considered, multiple sums appear and convergence of results is lost.

Extra–dimensional coupling constants are dimensionful, so that these physical descriptions are not renormalizable.
Kaluza–Klein theories, which provide us with a four–dimensional viewpoint, have their own coupling constants, which
turn out to be dimensionless. Moreover, the direct generalization of four–dimensional renormalizable formulations,
such as the Standard Model, to descriptions placed in extra dimensions generates Kaluza–Klein theories in which all
couplings are renormalizable in the Dyson’s sense. Consequently, loop amplitudes in which continuous and discrete
divergences coexist can be renormalized [61]. However, in many cases, there are contributions in which only discrete
divergences are present and they cannot be eliminated by renormalization. In Ref. [61], a regularization scheme to
deal with multiple Kaluza–Klein sums was recently introduced and explored. This approach, which is based on the
Epstein–zeta function [62–69], allows one to isolate divergences produced by these inﬁnite sums.

The Epstein–zeta function, which is a generalization of the Riemann–Zeta function, is deﬁned as

ζ(s; Q) = X06=x∈Zn

(xTQ x)s , R(s) >

n

,

(48)

where s is some complex number. The sum and the denominator within it, written in terms of the vector x, its
transpose xT, and the n × n matrix Q, together represent a multiple sum over integer numbers. Except for a simple
pole at s = n/2, the Epstein–zeta function is analytically continuated by means of the functional equation

ζ(s; Q) = (det Q)− 1

Following the prescription of Ref. [61], we assume that all extra dimensions are equally sized, that is, Rj ≡ R for any
j = 1, . . . , n. In this context, the Kaluza–Klein sums in Eq. (47) can be written as

where Il is the l × l identity matrix. The isolated singularities of these sums are given by l = 2. Using these results,
we ﬁnally write the eﬀective Lagrangian expansion as

These nonrenormalizable terms are divergent at l = 2, which means that in the case of only one extra dimension
(n = 1) all results are ﬁnite. This property of ﬁve–dimensional models has been reported in phenomenological
studies [111].

As it is discussed in Ref. [61], the divergent behavior of loop amplitudes that include inﬁnite Kaluza–Klein multiple
sums is determined by the number of extra dimensions and by the accuracy achieved in a given calculation. In the
present paper, we have restricted our result to the very ﬁrst nonrenormalizable terms of the eﬀective Lagrangian
expansion, that is, to those with mass–dimension 6. A more accurate eﬀective Lagrangian, however, would include
terms with larger mass dimensions. For instance, assume that we cut the eﬀective Lagrangian series at 1/m2K
(k) , for
some natural number K. The resulting eﬀective Lagrangian would read

Leﬀ = L(0)

4YM +X(k) " K
Xj=1

R2j βj,a

(k2)j Oj,a#,

Nj

Xa=1

(52)

where the βj,a are dimensionless constant coeﬃcients that depend on the gauge group, on the number of extra
dimensions, and on the four–dimensional coupling constant g. The Oj,a factors represent nonrenormalizable operators
of mass dimension (mass)2j and Nj is the total number of such operators for a ﬁxed mass dimension. The underlined
symbol k2 stands for any sum of quadratic Kaluza–Klein indices: k2
1 + · · ·+ k2
n.
Unless a cutoﬀ for the Kaluza–Klein sums is established, the sum over combinations (k) is formally divergent if n > 1.
We have seen that nonrenormalizable terms of mass–dimension 6, which correspond to j = 1, generate a divergence
in ζ(1, Il), at l = 2 . If somehow mass–dimension 6 terms were not present, we may have cut the seres at j = 2
(mass–dimension 8). Such terms would involve Epstein–zeta functions ζ(2, Il) instead, with a divergence at l = 4 as
long as n > 4, though being ﬁnite if n < 4. In general, any nonrenormalizable term with mass–dimension k, alone,
generates ultraviolet discrete divergences if n > k − 4, but such divergences are absent if n < k − 4. Thus, if a
more accurate eﬀective Lagrangian is derived, a diﬀerent divergent behavior is expected for a large enough number of
extra dimensions. It is important stressing that this discussion is rather qualitative, for there are individual divergent

speaking, in presence of nonrenormalizable terms of mass dimension larger than 6 we cannot separately analyze each

sums P(k) 1/(k2)j, which means that using P(k)Pj = PjP(k) in Eq. (52) may lead to incorrect results. Strictly
sum P(k) 1/(k2)j, for each diﬀerent value of j, and then infer the divergent nature of the whole eﬀective Lagrangian

expansion.

V. SUMMARY

Assuming that, besides the ordinary four–dimensional coordinates, spacetime comprises a set of compact dimensions,
each one with an orbifold structure, we have worked with a gauge theory governed by the SU(N, M4+n) group, in a
framework in which extra dimensions are universal. We have integrated out all the four–dimensional heavy degrees
of freedom that are produced by this formulation and which are part of the particle spectrum of the corresponding
Kaluza–Klein theory. The main result was the derivation of the ﬁrst nonrenormalizable terms, with mass–dimension
6, of an eﬀective Lagrangian that abides by low–energy symmetries and whose ﬁeld content is the set of Kaluza–Klein
zero modes. In passing, we have studied diverse aspects of extra–dimensional gauge theories. In particular, we have
given a glimpse on the quantization of these Kaluza–Klein descriptions, including an SU(N, M4)–covariant set of
gauge–ﬁxing functions, which preserves part of the gauge invariance of the Kaluza–Klein theory and thus induces
valuable simpliﬁcations in calculations. For instance, contributions from ghost–antighost ﬁelds are related in a simple
way to those from pseudo–Goldstone bosons. We have also provided the full set of couplings that involve heavy
modes, including Kaluza–Klein ghost and antighost ﬁelds, and which contribute to standard Green’s functions since
the one–loop level. We have emphasized that our resulting eﬀective Lagrangian is gauge independent with respect
to gauge–ﬁxing of the Kaluza–Klein gauge excited modes. The imperative joint intervention of the contributions
from Kaluza–Klein heavy gauge ﬁelds, pseudo–Goldstone bosons, and ghost and antighost ﬁelds to attain gauge
independence was pointed out. We implemented a novel regularization approach, based on the Epstein–zeta function,
which is intended to isolate ultraviolet divergences that are encrypted within multiple and inﬁnite Kaluza–Klein sums.
In applying the Epstein–zeta regularization to our results, divergences were explicitly separated and precisely located.
The resulting expression shows that, as expected, divergences of the ﬁrst nonrenormalizable terms only arise when
the number of extra dimensions is 2 or greater. We point out that, for a large enough number of extra dimensions, the
divergent behavior of a more accurate eﬀective Lagrangian expansion will be modiﬁed by nonrenormalizable terms of
larger mass dimensions. To this respect, recall that accuracy, in the context of eﬀective theories, means to add more
nonrenormalizable terms. Standard divergencies, from integration of continuous four–dimensional momentum, also

appear in our expansion. Moreover, nondecoupling eﬀects driven by logarithmic terms that are subject to multiple
Kaluza–Klein sums are present as well. However, we have stressed that the renormalization procedure used to remove
standard divergencies eliminates these eﬀects, rendering them unobservable.
