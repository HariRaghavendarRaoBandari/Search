We review the dynamics after quantum quenches in integrable quantum spin chains. We give a pedagogical
introduction to relaxation in isolated quantum systems, and discuss the description of the steady state by (gen-
eralized) Gibbs ensembles. When then turn to general features in the time evolution of local observables after
the quench, using a simple model of free fermions as an example. In the second part we present an overview
of recent progress in describing quench dynamics in two key paradigms for quantum integrable models, the
transverse ﬁeld Ising chain and the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.

INTRODUCTION

An isolated many-particle quantum system is characterized by the absence of any coupling to its environment. According to
the laws of quantum mechanics its time evolution is unitary and governed by the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation. In order
to specify the state |Ψ(t)(cid:105) of the system at a given time t, it is then sufﬁcient to know its Hamiltonian H and its state at an earlier
time

|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = e−iHt|Ψ(0)(cid:105).

(1)

In spite of this purely unitary evolution, macroscopic systems are expected to eventually “relax” in some way and be amenable
to a description by quantum Statistical Mechanics1. For many-particle systems it is convenient to focus on the time evolution of
the expectation values of particular observables of interest rather than the state itself, i.e. one considers

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O|Ψ(t)(cid:105) .

(2)

Historically, studies of many-particle quantum systems such as electronic degrees of freedom in solids mainly focussed on
equilibrium properties at zero and ﬁnite temperature. This is because in the context of solids, the many-body system of interest
is typically coupled to an “environment”, i.e. other degrees of freedom, the presence of which is felt after very short time
scales. The situation changed dramatically about a decade ago, when it became possible to experimentally investigate the non-
equilibrium dynamics of clouds of ultra-cold, trapped atoms2–17. These are by design almost isolated. Moreover the natural
energy scale underlying the dynamics is incredibly small, so that there is a long time window (on the order of seconds) for
conducting experiments. The main effect of the coupling to the environment is particle loss through heating. This eventually
becomes signiﬁcant, but over an intermediate time window the dynamics is to a good approximation unitary. It is important
to note in view of the following discussion that ﬁnite size effects are often important in cold atom systems, and as a result of
the trapping potential they are not translationally invariant. They are however highly tuneable both with regards to Hamiltonian
parameters and their effective dimensionality. This was exploited in the seminal Quantum Newton’s Cradle experiments by
Kinoshita, Wenger and Weiss3. These investigated the non-equilibrium evolution of one, two and three dimensional Bose gases
that were initially driven out of equilibrium. While the two and three dimensional systems were seen to relax very quickly
towards an equilibrium state, the behaviour in the one dimensional case was very different. In Ref. 3 this was attributed to

the presence of approximate conservation laws. Neglecting the trap, the Hamiltonian is well approximated by the Lieb-Linger
model18

The Hamiltonian (3) is integrable and as a result has an inﬁnite number of conservation laws In

19,20 such that

[H, In] = [In, Im] = 0.

It is intuitively clear that conservation laws will affect the quantum dynamics, because they impose constraints of the form

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|In|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = const.

The difference in behaviours between the one and three dimensional Quantum Newton’s Cradle experiments suggested that the
non-equilbirium dynamics of integrable models is unusual. This was one of the motivations for the recent intense theoretical
efforts aimed at understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of integrable quantum many-particle systems. Integrable models
come in a variety of guises, the two main classes being

• Lattice models:
These include non-interacting fermion and boson theories21–23, models that can be mapped to free fermions like the
transverse-ﬁeld Ising24–42 and XY chains43–51, spin models like the Heisenberg chain52–71 and electronic theories like the
Hubbard model72–76.
• Continuum models:
These include free ﬁeld theories like the Klein-Gordon77–79 and Luttinger models52,80–85 (see the review by M. Cazalilla
in this volume), conformal ﬁeld theories79,86–90 (see the review by P. Calabrese and J. Cardy in this volume), massive
relativistic ﬁeld theories like the sine-Gordon91–93, sinh-Gordon94–97 and nonlinear sigma models98 and non-relativistic
ﬁeld theories like the Lieb-Liniger model99–111. In continuum models the spectrum of elementary excitations is unbounded,
which leads to certain differences as compared to lattice models.

In this review we focus on the equilibrium dynamics in integrable lattice models. We moreover restrict our discussion to a
particular protocol for inducing out of equilibrium dynamics, the so-called quantum quench. We note that other protocols have
been studied in the literature. One example are ramps112,113, which are of interest in relation to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism114.
The outline of this review is as follows. In section II we deﬁne what we mean by a quantum quench. This is followed by a
discussion in section III, of how isolated many-particle quantum systems relax, and how to describe their late time behaviour.
In section IV we provide a simple example that shows these ideas at work. Having established a framework for the late time
behaviour after a quantum quench, section V turns to the discussion of general features of the evolution of observables at ﬁnite
times, such as how correlations spread through the system. Section VI is concerned with one of the key paradigms of quantum
quenches, the transverse ﬁeld Ising chain (TFIC). This constitutes a non-trivial example, for which it is nevertheless possible to
obtain exact results in closed form. From the point of view of quantum integrability the TFIC is quite special, because it can
be mapped onto a non-interacting fermionic theory by means of a (non-local) Jordan-Wigner transformation. The case of fully
interacting integrable models (deﬁned as having scattering matrices that are different from ±1) is discussed in section VII. We
conclude with an outlook on some open problems of current interest in section VIII.
Apart from the other contributions to this Special Issue, there have been several previous reviews113,115–118 on closely related

topics. They differ considerably in perspective, focus, scope and style, and are therefore largely complementary to ours.

II. THE ESSENCE OF A GLOBAL QUANTUM QUENCH

Our starting point is an isolated many-particle quantum system characterized by a time-independent, translationally invariant
Hamiltonian H(h) with only short-range interactions. Here h is a system parameter such as a magnetic ﬁeld, or an interaction
strength. An example we will return to frequently throughout this review is the transverse ﬁeld Ising chain (TFIC)

H(h) = −J

where σα
1 (α = x, y, z). The
short-ranged nature of H(h) is an essential condition and it is known that models with inﬁnite range interactions such as the

j are Pauli matrices acting on a spin-1/2 on site j of a one dimensional ring, and σα

BCS problem119 exhibit a very different behaviour when driven out of equilibrium. Let us imagine that we somehow prepare
this system in the ground state |Ψ(0)(cid:105) of H(h0). This state is highly non-generic in the sense that it has low entanglement120–122.
At time t = 0 we then suddenly “quench” the system parameter to a new value h, and then consider subsequent unitary time
evolution with our new Hamiltonian H(h). As the change of Hamiltonian is assumed to be instantaneous, the system remains
in state |Ψ(0)(cid:105) (“sudden approximation”). At times t > 0 the state of the system is found by solving the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation

(7)
We are interested in the cases where in a large, ﬁnite volume the initial state |Ψ(0)(cid:105) has non-zero overlaps with an exponentially
large number of the eigenstates of H(h). The case where |Ψ(0)(cid:105) has non-zero overlaps with only a ﬁnite, system-size indepen-
dent number of eigenstates is equivalent to the one discussed in undergraduate Quantum Mechanics courses. In terms of energy
eigenstates

|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = e−iH(h)t|Ψ(0)(cid:105).

we can express the state of the system at time t as

|Ψ(t)(cid:105) =

H(h)|n(cid:105) = En|n(cid:105) , En ≥ E0 ,

(cid:88)
n (cid:104)n|Ψ(0)(cid:105) e−iEnt|n(cid:105) .

Our objective is the description of expectation values of a certain class of operators O, that will be deﬁned in detail later, in the
state |Ψ(t)(cid:105)

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O|Ψ(t)(cid:105) =

All the interesting phenomena after a quantum quench arise from the presence of the oscillatory factors e−i(Em−En)t, which
induce quantum mechanical interference effects123, in the double sum over exponentially (in system size) many terms. We note
that focussing on expectation values is not as restrictive as it may ﬁrst appear, as it still allows us to consider the full probability
distributions of the observables we are interested in.

A crucial property of a global quantum quench is that energy is conserved at all t > 0, and that the post-quench energy density

is larger than the ground state energy per site

e = lim
L→∞

.

(11)

This means that through the quantum quench we explore a region of Hilbert space that is macroscopically different from the
sector containing the ground state and low-lying excitations.

In practice one often considers more general “quench protocols”, where for example H(h) and/or |Ψ(0)(cid:105) are invariant only
under translations by 2, 3, ... sites50,62,124, and initial states that are not necessarily pure77, but are described by a density matrix
ρ(0). Considering ρ(0) to be a thermal density matrix provides a simple way of varying the energy density e “injected” into the
system. It is essential for our purposes that the initial density matrix ρ(0) has a cluster decomposition property125

lim|x−y|→∞ Tr [ρ(0)O(x)O(y)] = Tr [ρ(0)O(x)] Tr [ρ(0)O(y)] ,

(12)

and we elaborate on this point in Appendix A. Invariance of the initial density matrix under translations is another key require-
ment. Inhomogeneous initial conditions have been considered by many authors in the literature, see e.g. Refs 43, 53, 54, 103,
126–150, but we will not consider them here.

III. RELAXATION IN ISOLATED QUANTUM SYSTEMS

Given that we are considering an isolated quantum system, an obvious question is in what sense it may relax to a stationary
state at late times after we have driven it out of equilibrium. In order to sharpen the following argument, let us revisit the case
discussed in Section II, namely an isolated system initially prepared in a pure state |Ψ(0)(cid:105), that is not an eigenstate of the (time
independent) Hamiltonian H(h) describing the time evolution after our quantum quench. Let us now consider the following
class of hermitian operators

Ojk = |j(cid:105)(cid:104)k| + |k(cid:105)(cid:104)j| .

(13)

(15)

(16)

(17)

range(cid:0) k(cid:89)

(cid:1) = k .

σαj
j

Their expectation values in the state |Ψ(t)(cid:105) can be expressed using (9) as

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|Ojk|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = ei(Ej−Ek)t(cid:104)Ψ(0)|j(cid:105)(cid:104)k|Ψ(0)(cid:105) + c.c.

(14)
We see that generically the right hand side exhibits periodic oscillatory behaviour in time. Hence the observables Ojk generically
do not relax at late times. A crucial point is that Ojk are generally very nonlocal in space. As locality is an important concept in
quantum quenches it is useful to deﬁne what we mean by a local operator.
Deﬁnition 1. Local Operators.

5

In lattice models an operator O is called local if in the thermodynamic limit O acts non-trivially only on a ﬁnite number of

sites separated by a ﬁnite distance. For a quantum spin-1/2 chain with L sites examples of local operators are

j (α = x, y, z) are Pauli matrices acting on site j. On the other hand operators such as

are nonlocal. Acting with a local operator on a state |ψ(cid:105) does not change its macroscopic properties (e.g. its energy per volume
in the thermodynamic limit).
Deﬁnition 2. Range of a local operator.

j=1

The range of a local operator O is the size of the largest interval on which it acts non-trivially. For the examples above we

have

range(σα

j ) = 1 ,

range(σα

j=1

A. Local Relaxation

The previous argument shows that an isolated quantum system prepared in a pure state cannot relax in its entirety. However,
it can and do relax locally in space25,27,123,151–153. To explain this concept let us consider the example of a one-dimensional spin
system with Hamiltonian H with only short-range interactions. An example would be the TFIC (6). We partition the entire
system into an arbitrary but ﬁnite subsystem B and its complement A. Eventually we will take the thermodynamic limit while
keeping B ﬁxed. Let us prepare our spin system at time t = 0 in some initial density matrix ρ(0) that is not an eigenstate of H.
At later times the entire system is characterized by the density matrix

ρ(t) = e−iHtρ(0)eiHt.

(18)

The reduced density matrix of the subsystem B is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom in A

(19)
It is instructive to give an explicit representation of the reduced density matrix for our spin chain example. An orthonormal
basis of states is given by

ρB(t) = TrAρ(t).

|σ1, σ2, . . . , σL(cid:105) =

FIG. 1. Local relaxation in an isolated many-particle quantum system: we partition the entire system into an arbitrary ﬁnite subsystem B and
its complement A. We then take the thermodynamic limit while keeping B ﬁxed. Expectation values of all operators that act non-trivially only
in B will relax to stationary values at late times.

Deﬁnition 3. Local Relaxation.

We say that our system relaxes locally, if the limit

lim
t→∞ lim

L→∞ ρB(t) = ρB(∞)

(22)

exists for any ﬁnite subsystem B.

Deﬁnition 4. Stationary State.

Consider a system that relaxes locally in the sense just deﬁned. Then its stationary state is deﬁned as a time-independent

density matrix ρSS for the full system such that for any ﬁnite subsystem B

(cid:0)ρSS(cid:1) = ρB(∞),

lim
L→∞ TrA

(23)

where A is the complement of B. We stress that this equivalence applies only at the level of ﬁnite subsystems in the thermody-
namic limit and not for the density matrices of the full system.

Deﬁnition 5. Local equivalence of ensembles.

Let ρ1 and ρ2 be two density matrices. We call the corresponding two ensembles locally equivalent, if in the thermodynamic

limit the reduced density matrices for any ﬁnite subsystem B coincide, i.e.

lim|A|→∞ TrA (ρ1) = lim|A|→∞ TrA (ρ2) .

Here A is the complement of B and |A| denotes its volume. We denote local equivalence by

ρ1 =loc ρ2.

(24)

(25)

A key problem in the ﬁeld of non-equilibrium dynamics is the determination of the stationary state density matrix. A key role
in determining ρSS is played by symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In translationally invariant systems there are essentially two
paradigms for local relaxation, and we turn to their respective descriptions next. Before doing so an important comment is
in order. By design our focus is on local operators, which in turn leads us to deﬁne local relaxation in the sense formulated
above. In practice one might be interested in observables that are formally not captured by our framework, and yet might relax
to stationary values. A simple example would be expectation values of the momentum distribution function, which is the Fourier
transform of the single particle Green’s function. We note that this can be reconstructed to a given precision from the expectation
values of local operators in cases where the initial state has a ﬁnite correlation length, and the single particle Green’s function at
ﬁxed separation relaxes exponentially in time154.

As we are dealing with an isolated system, energy is always a conserved quantity

E = Tr (ρ(t)H) = Tr(cid:0)e−iHtρ(0)eiHtH(cid:1) = Tr (ρ(0)H) .

(26)

B. Thermalization

BAAIn absence of other conserved quantities isolated systems are believed to locally relax to thermal equilibrium. This is known as
thermalization1,155,156. In the framework we have set up, this means that our stationary state is described by a Gibbs ensemble

7

ρSS =loc ρGibbs =

Tr (ρ(0)H) = lim
L→∞

Tr(cid:0)ρGibbsH(cid:1) .

(27)

(28)

We once again stress that (27) implies only that in the thermodynamic limit the stationary state is locally indistinguishable
from a Gibbs ensemble in the sense that expectation values of all operators that act non-trivially only in a ﬁnite subsystem are
identical to the corresponding thermal expectation values. The physical picture underlying thermalization is that the inﬁnitely
large complement of our subsystem acts like a heat bath with an effective inverse temperature βeﬀ.

We note that βeﬀ deﬁned in this way can be either positive or negative. The meaning of a negative temperature in this context
is as follows. Let us consider a Hamiltonian with bounded spectrum (e.g. a quantum spin model). Then the average energy
associated with H is

Depending on our initial density matrix we now have two possibilities

¯e = lim
L→∞

1
L

Tr (H) .

We note that negative temperature ensembles have been observed experimentally in Ref. 157.

e < ¯e ⇒ βeﬀ > 0 ,
e > ¯e ⇒ βeﬀ < 0 .

C. Generalized Gibbs Ensembles (GGE)

(29)

(30)

We now turn to the case of systems with additional local conservation laws I (n). These are operators that commute with the

Hamiltonian

[H, I (n)] = 0,

(31)

and have the property that their densities are local operators.
commute with one another

In most of the cases of interest these conservation laws also

(32)
and we will assume this to be the case in the following. Exceptions to (32) are known50,89,90 (see also Sec. III C 1). What we
mean by local conservation laws is best explained by an example. The TFIC (6) has inﬁnitely many local conservation laws in
the thermodynamic limit158

The conservation laws themselves are extensive, but their densities I (n,±)
involve only ﬁnite numbers of neighbouring sites

where in the ﬁrst step we used translational invariance. An obvious question at this point is why we insist on conservation laws
to be local. The answer lies in the simple fact that any Hamiltonian has at least as many non-local conservation laws as there are
basis states in the Hilbert space. Let us consider one-dimensional projectors on energy eigenstates

Then we clearly have

H|n(cid:105) = En|n(cid:105) , Pn = |n(cid:105)(cid:104)n|.

(36)

8

(37)
which imply that the expectation values of all Pn are time independent. Importantly, these conservation laws are not local, and
as they exist for any Hamiltonian they are not expected to have any profound effect. In contrast, local conservation laws are
rather special and, as is clear from (35), have important consequences for local relaxation after quantum quenches.

[Pn, Pm] = 0 = [Pn, H] ,

An immediate consequence of (35) is that systems with local conservation laws cannot thermalize after a quantum quench,
because the system retains memory of the initial expectation values of all conserved quantities at all times. The maximum
entropy principle159 then suggests that the stationary state density matrix should be given by a GGE160

Here λn are Lagrange multipliers that are ﬁxed by the initial conditions (35), as we require that

local nor extensive. An equivalent set of local, extensive conserved quantities is easily found

I (n,+) = 2J

I (n,−) = 2J

The crucial point is that these conservation laws are linearly related to the mode occupation numbers. This implies that the
GGE describing the stationary state after a quantum quench to the Hamiltonian H can be constructed either from the local
conservation laws, or from the mode occupation numbers

At this point a word of caution is in order. There are cases in which local conservation laws exist that cannot be expressed in
terms of mode occupation operators. In non-interacting theories this occurs if the dispersion relation in the ﬁnite volume has
additional symmetries. An example is provided by setting µ = 0 in our tight-binding model (40), in which case the dispersion
has the symmetry (p) = −(π − p). In this case the following operator commutes with the Hamiltonian

but is clearly neither expressible in terms of mode occupation operators, nor does it commute with the latter. In cases like this
the stationary state is not always locally equivalent to a GGE of the form (43) since the constraints arising from the additional
local charges must be imposed as well50,90,161.

D. Generalized Microcanonical Ensemble (GMC)

In equilibrium Statistical Physics it is well known that in the thermodynamic limit the Gibbs ensemble becomes equivalent
to the microcanonical ensemble. In the quench context analogous equivalences of ensembles hold, and we now turn to their
discussion.

1. Generic Systems

We have stated above that generic systems thermalize when their stationary state density matrix is equal to a Gibbs ensemble
in the sense of (23), (27), where the effective temperature is ﬁxed by the energy density e given by (28). There is strong numerical
evidence156,162–171 that an equivalent microcanonical ensemble can be constructed in the form

(45)
where |n(cid:105) is any energy eigenstate (of the post-quench Hamiltonian) with energy density e. Importantly, no averaging over a
microcanonical energy shell is required. This implies that in generic systems all energy eigenstates at a given energy density are
locally indistinguishable and thermal. The microcanonical description for the stationary state of a thermalizing system is then

ρMC = |n(cid:105)(cid:104)n| ,

ρSS =loc ρMC .

(46)

2. Systems with local conservation laws

If a system has local conservation laws other than energy the above construction needs to be modiﬁed. This was ﬁrst dis-
cussed in the non-interacting case by Cassidy et.al.21 and subsequently generalized to interacting integrable models by Caux
and Essler172. Let us recall that the “initial data” for a (post quench) system with local conservation laws I (n) and Hamiltonian
H = I (1) is

(cid:16)

ρ(0)I (n)(cid:17)

.

e(n) = lim
L→∞

1
L

Tr

The stationary state is then locally equivalent to the density matrix

ρSS =loc ρGMC = |Φ(cid:105)(cid:104)Φ| ,
where |Φ(cid:105) is a simultaneous eigenstate of all local conservation laws such that
|Φ(cid:105) = 0 .

lim
L→∞

(cid:21)

L

(47)

(48)

(49)

(51)

(52)

The conditions (49) ensure that all I (n) have the correct expectation values (47) in the stationary state. An obvious question
is how to construct |Φ(cid:105) in practice. For non-interacting lattice models this is often straightforward as we now discuss. In free
theories the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in terms of mode occupation operators n(k) = c†(k)c(k)

H =

(k)n(k) ,

[n(k), n(q)] = 0 = [n(k), H].

(50)

As discussed above the n(k) are in one-to-one correspondence with local conservation laws and can therefore be used to construct
GGEs. The initial conditions (47) therefore ﬁx the densities ρ(k) of particles with momentum k

k

(cid:88)

Tr (ρ(0)n(k)) = ρ(k) .

In a large, ﬁnite volume L, the state |Φ(cid:105) can then be taken as a Fock state

N(cid:89)

j=1

|Φ(cid:105) =

c†(kj)|0(cid:105) ,

c(q)|0(cid:105) = 0 .

The kj need to be chosen to reproduce the correct particle density ρ(k) in the thermodynamic limit N, L → ∞, n = N/L ﬁxed.
Noting that ∆n = ρ(k)∆k we see that a possible choice is

kj+1 = kj +

1

Lρ(kj)

.

(53)

In practice we can determine ρ(k) from (51), construct the state |Φ(cid:105) from (52), (53), and then use it to form ρGMC. In interacting
theories the construction is analogous but considerably more involved and will be discussed in Section VII.
In contrast to the non-integrable case, energy eigenstates at a given energy density e are not all locally indistinguishable and
thermal. While the typical state at a given e is thermal in this case as well, there exist other, non-thermal, macro-states at a given
e. However, their entropies are smaller than the one of the thermal equilibrium state. A more detailed discussion is given in
Appendix B.

E. Time averaged relaxation and Diagonal Ensemble

In the literature a different deﬁnition of relaxation after quantum quenches in ﬁnite systems is widely used115,118. Let us for
simplicity consider a one-dimensional system on a ring of length L, which is initially prepared in a state with density matrix
ρ(0). The time average of an operator O is then deﬁned as
¯OL = lim
T→∞

dt Tr (ρ(t) O) ,

(cid:90) T

(54)

1
T

0

where we have introduced the subscript L to indicate that the system size is kept ﬁxed at L, and where we assumed the limit
T → ∞ to exist. The operator O is then said to relax if its expectation value is very close to its time average most of the time,
i.e. if

(cid:90) T

0

1
T

dt(cid:2)Tr (ρ(t) O) − ¯OL

(cid:3)2

(cid:28) ¯O2
L.

(55)

Physically this way of thinking about relaxation is very different from ours. This is most easily understood for a non-interacting
system, which by construction features stable particle and hole excitations. Let us denote their maximal group velocity by vmax.
In time average relaxation one considers times t such that vmaxt (cid:29) L, i.e. the stable excitations traverse the entire system many
times. In contrast, our way of deﬁning relaxation is based on taking the thermodynamic limit ﬁrst, and then considering late
times.
A natural question to ask is what statistical ensemble describes the averages ¯O. To see this let us consider time evolution with
a Hamiltonian H that has non-degenerate eigenvalues En. Expanding the density matrix in the basis of energy eigenstates gives

(cid:88)
n,m(cid:104)n|ρ(0)|m(cid:105) e−i(En−Em)t|n(cid:105)(cid:104)m| .

ρ(t) =

(56)

(57)

(58)

Substituting this back into (54) and using that the energy eigenvalues are non-degenerate we arrive at

(cid:88)
n (cid:104)n|ρ(0)|n(cid:105) (cid:104)n|O|n(cid:105).

¯OL =

This shows that time averages involve only the diagonal elements (in the energy eigenbasis) of the density matrix. The description
(57) is known as diagonal ensemble. Is there a relation between the subsystem view of relaxation and the time-averaged one? It
is believed that for local operators O the two viewpoints are in fact equivalent in the sense that

¯OL = Tr(cid:2)ρSSO

(cid:3) .

lim
L→∞

In the case of the TFIM this has been shown in Appendix E of Ref. 25 and elaborated on in Ref. 29.

F. Symmetry restoration

An interesting question in the quantum quench context concerns problems where the Hamiltonian is invariant under a sym-

metry operation, but the initial state after the quench is not. If we denote the symmetry operation by U, then we have

The question is then, whether or not the symmetry associated with U is restored in the stationary state

[H, U ] = 0 ,

U|Ψ(0)(cid:105) (cid:54)= |Ψ(0)(cid:105).

[ρSS, U ] ?= 0.

(59)

(60)

The answer to this is quite straightforward for the stationary states we have considered here, which are described by (generalized)
Gibbs ensembles

Clearly, if U is a symmetry of all local conservation laws

ρSS =loc ρGGE =

(61)

(62)

[I (n), U ] = 0 ,

∀n ,

11

the symmetry associated with U will be restored in the stationary state. Conversely, if there is at least one conservation law
for which [I (s), U ] (cid:54)= 0, then the symmetry will remain broken in the stationary state. It is useful to consider some explicit
examples.

The TFIC Hamiltonian (6) is invariant under rotations of the spins around the z-axis by 180 degrees

1. Spin-ﬂip symmetry

U σα

(cid:96) U = −σα

(cid:96) , α = x, y.

(63)

A quantum quench of the transverse ﬁeld starting in the ordered phase h < 1 leads to an initial state that breaks this symmetry.
However, the local conservation laws (33) that characterize the stationary state are invariant with respect to spin reﬂection. As a
result the spin ﬂip symmetry is restored in the stationary state27, as will be shown in Section VI.

The Hamiltonian of the tight-binding model (40) is invariant under the parity transformation (reﬂection across a link)

2. Parity symmetry

†
1−(cid:96) .
(cid:96)U = ic

(64)
On the other hand, the set of charges I (n,−) in (42) is odd under U, and hence a quantum quench from a state that is not parity
even does not generally result in a parity-symmetric stationary state. As an example we may consider the time evolution of the
(cid:16)

and consequently the stationary state cannot be not symmetric under (64).

3. Translational symmetry

(66)

(67)

If we allow the initial state to partially break translational symmetry the situation can become signiﬁcantly more complicated.

An interesting example is provided by the quantum XY model173

(68)

where we take L to be even. As long as we consider quenches from translationally invariant initial states, the stationary behaviour
is described by a GGE constructed from local conservation laws Q(n,±) along the lines described above. The situation changes
for initial states |Ψ2(0)(cid:105) that are invariant only under translations by two sites. One might naively expect that translational
symmetry gets restored in the stationary state, but this is in fact not the case50. This can be understood by noting that H has local
conservation laws that are not translationally invariant, an example being

(−1)(cid:96)(cid:104) 1 + γ

(69)

Generically one will have (cid:104)Ψ2(0)|J +
times. The construction of a GGE in this case is complicated by the fact that J +
an initial state dependent selection of mutually commuting local conservation laws.

1 |Ψ2(0)(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0, and as J +

1 is conserved, translational invariance must remain broken at all
1 does not commute with all Q(n,±), and involves

G. Truncating Generalized Gibbs Ensembles

As we have seen above, GGEs in integrable models involve inﬁnite numbers of conservation laws in the thermodynamic limit.
A natural question to ask is whether all of these are equally important for the description of the stationary state, or whether
certain classes are more important than others. A general framework for investigating this question was developed in Ref. 27 and
then applied to the speciﬁc example of quenches in the TFIC. The main ﬁndings are conjectured to apply much more generally
to quenches in integrable models. A key measure of importance of a given conservation law is its degree of locality27 Dloc. This
is straightforward to quantify for conservation laws like (33), which have densities that act non-trivially only on a ﬁxed number
of n + 1 neighbouring sites,

(cid:0)I (n)(cid:1) = n + 1.

The idea of Ref. 27 was to select various ﬁnite subsets {Jm|m = 1, . . . , y} ⊂ {I (n)}, and ask how well the density matrices

A useful way of comparing the full ρGGE and partial ρpGGE,y GGEs is through a distance D(ρ(cid:96), ρ(cid:48)
(cid:96)) on the space of reduced
density matrices on an interval of length (cid:96). In order for ρpGGE,y to be a good approximation to ρpGGE it should be possible to
make the distance between their respective reduced density matrices arbitrarily small

(73)

The ﬁndings of Ref. 27 show that if even a single conservation law with small degree of locality is excluded, the approximation
(71) immediately becomes very poor, and the only way to achieve (73) is by retaining all conservation laws with the smallest
degrees of locality (70), i.e. by considering “truncated GGEs” of the form

ρtGGE,y =

The value of y is then determined by the required degree of accuracy  in (73). A consequence of these ﬁndings is that the full
GGE can in fact be deﬁned as the limit of truncated GGEs

ρGGE ≡ lim

y→∞ ρtGGE,y .

(75)

The limiting procedure (75) was originally introduced in a non-interacting model (the transverse-ﬁeld Ising)27, and has since
proved very useful for the construction of GGEs and the calculation of the stationary state values of local observables in inter-
acting integrable models17,57,58,63,174.

To exhibit the above ideas more explicitly it is useful to consider the example of a transverse ﬁeld quench in the disordered
phase of the TFIC27. Fig. 2 shows results for an appropriately deﬁned distance between the reduced density matrices of the
full and truncated GGEs as a function of the number y of conservation laws retained in (74). Ten different subsystem sized
(cid:96) = 5, 10, . . . , 50 are shown.

FIG. 2. Distance D(y)∞ = D(ρGGE
), as deﬁned in (156), between the GGE and the truncated GGEs obtained by imposing local
conservation laws with densities involving at most y + 1 consecutive sites. The quench is from h0 = 1.2 to h = 3 and the subsystem
size ranges from (cid:96) = 5 to (cid:96) = 50. Colors and sizes change gradually as a function of the size (cid:96). For y > (cid:96), the distance starts decaying
exponentially in y, with an (cid:96)-independent decay rate. [Picture from Ref. 27]

dependent value. This means that conservation laws I (n) with n (cid:29) (cid:96) play a negligible role in describing stationary state
properties in a subsystem of size (cid:96). The main message is then as follows:

The smaller the degree of locality of a conservation law is, the more important it is for describing the stationary
properties of local observables.

H. Dynamical properties in the stationary state

It is clearly of interest to go beyond the equal time correlators we have discussed so far and consider dynamical (non equal
time) correlations. In particular one can envisage using them to characterize the stationary state in the same way they are used
in thermal equilibrium. An example would be the measurement of dynamical response functions in the stationary state by e.g.
photoemission spectroscopy175. For such purposes the objects of interest are of the form

lim
t→∞(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O1(t1)···On(tn)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) ,

(76)

where Oj are local observables. The problem one is faced with is that the descriptions of the stationary state by statistical
ensembles (GGE, GMC) a priori hold only at the level of ﬁnite subsystems in the thermodynamic limit. On the other hand, time
dependent operators act by construction non-trivially on the entire system, which moves them beyond the remit of applicability
of the framework set out above. This issue was addressed in Ref. 28, which established that the stationary state density matrix
ρSS that describes the local relaxation in fact provides a correct description of dynamical correlations as well, i.e.

t→∞(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O1(t1)···On(tn)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = Tr[ρSSO1(t1)···On(tn)] .
lim

(77)

The proof of this statement is based on the Lieb-Robinson bound (see Sec. V A) and more speciﬁcally on a theorem by Bravyi,
Hastings, and Verstraete176, who showed that time-evolving operators (in the Heisenberg picture) are well approximated by local
operators with a range that increases linearly in time. We stress that (77) does not depend on which statistical ensemble describes
the local relaxation in the stationary state, i.e. for generic systems ρSS would be a Gibbs or a microcanonical density matrix,
while for integrable systems it would be that of a GGE or GMC.

37, 40, and 177. In thermal equilibrium, the FDR connects the imaginary part of the linear response function χAB(ω, (cid:126)q|ρ) of
two observables A, B to the corresponding spectral function SAB(ω, (cid:126)q|ρ)

Let us now turn to FDRs in the steady state after quantum quenches. Clearly, if the system thermalizes (27), the equilibrium
FDR (78) with inverse temperature βeﬀ applies. If on the other hand the system locally relaxes to a GGE, the imaginary part of
the linear response function ceases to be proportional to the spectral function28,37,40. This can be traced back to the absence of
a simple relationship between the spectral functions at positive and negative frequencies. However, the basic form of the FDR

The fermion two-point functions at t > 0 are thus equal to

Importantly the “anomalous” average (cid:104)Ψ(t)|cj+(cid:96)cj|Ψ(t)(cid:105) vanishes in this limit. We can now immediately conclude that our
system relaxes locally to some steady state : any operator O acting non-trivially only on a given, ﬁnite subsystem B can be
expressed in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators acting only on sites in B. We then can use Wick’s theorem
to express the expectation value of (cid:104)Ψ(t)|O|Ψ(t)(cid:105) in terms of the functions fL((cid:96)) and gL((cid:96), t). After taking the inﬁnite volume
limit L → ∞, the limit t → ∞ of the resulting expression exists. This argument shows that the steady state is completely
characterized by the two-point functions (93) and the fact that Wick’s theorem holds.

A. Generalized Gibbs Ensemble

According to our previous discussion the steady state should be described by the GGE (43), where the Lagrange multipliers

are ﬁxed by

Tr(cid:2)ρGGEc†(k)c(k)(cid:3) =

= (cid:104)Ψ(0)|c†(k)c(k)|Ψ(0)(cid:105) = sin2(cid:0)Θk/2(cid:1) .

1 + eµk

As the GGE density matrix is Gaussian a Wick’s theorem holds, and as a consequence of (94) the two-point functions in the GGE
coincide with those of our steady state. As we have a Wick’s theorem in the steady state as well, the GGE correctly reproduces
all multi-point correlation functions. This proves that the steady state in our example is locally equivalent to the GGE (43), (94).

V. SPREADING OF CORRELATIONS AFTER A QUANTUM QUENCH

Let us now turn to the time dependence of the expectation values of local operators after a quantum quench. As an example

we consider the connected correlation function of the fermionic density nj = c

†
jcj in our example of section IV

SL((cid:96), t) = (cid:104)Ψ(t)|nj+(cid:96)nj|Ψ(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)Ψ(t)|nj+(cid:96)|Ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ(t)|nj|Ψ(t)(cid:105) .

(95)

Application of Wick’s theorem gives

SL((cid:96), t) = |gL(−(cid:96), t)|2 − |fL((cid:96))|2.

16

(96)

It is convenient to isolate the time dependent part |gL(−(cid:96), t)|2, which is shown in Fig. 3 for a quantum quench, where we start
in the ground state of H(∆ = 2J, µ = −J) and time evolve with H(0, µ = −J). At a ﬁxed value of (cid:96) the connected correlator

tF =

(cid:96)

2vmax

,

(97)

where in our example vmax = 2J is the maximal group velocity of elementary particle and hole excitations of H(0, µ = −J).
At t ≈ tF the connected correlator increases substantially, goes through a maximum, and then decays in an oscillating fashion.
A physical explanation for the light cone effect was provided by Calabrese and Cardy79,86. For a non-interacting, non-relativistic
theory like the one in our example it goes as follows. We focus on connected correlation functions of local operators, e.g.

GOO(r1, r2; t) = (cid:104)Ψ(t)|O(r1)O(r2)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)Ψ(t)|O(r1)|Ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O(r2)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) .

(98)

This is the average of the simultaneous measurement of the observables O(rj) minus the product of the averages of separate
measurements of Oj at time t after the quench. The initial state in our case is characterized by a ﬁnite correlation length ξ

GOO(r1, r2; t = 0) ∝ e−|r1−r2|/ξ ,

(99)

simply H(0, µ) =(cid:80)

and is therefore extremely small at large spatial separations. At time t = 0 the quantum quench generates a ﬁnite density of
stable quasiparticle excitations throughout the system. Their dispersion relation is 0(p) as our post-quench Hamiltonian is

k 0(k)n(k). The maximal group velocity of these free fermionic excitations is

vmax = maxp

d0(p)

dp

= 2J.

(100)

At times t > 0 the quasi-particles created by the quench propagate through the system. A measurement at rj will be inﬂuenced
by quasi-particles from within the “backwards light cone” [rj − vmaxt, rj + vmaxt]. At all times t > 0 this will affect the value
|r2−r1|
of the 1-point functions (cid:104)Ψ(t)|O(rj)|Ψ(t)(cid:105), but the effect cancels in the connected two-point function. At time t∗ =
2vmax
the backwards light cones emanating from r1 and r2 touch, and the average of measurements at r1 and r2 becomes correlated.

17

FIG. 4. “Quasi-particle picture” for the light cone effect86: (a) At time t = 0 the quantum quench creates quasi-particle excitations throughout
the system. (b) At time t quasi-particles from within the “backward light cone” [rj − vmaxt, rj + vmaxt] will affect a “measurement” at

These connected correlations are induced by quasi-particle pairs created at time t = 0 and propagating with group velocities

Since the work of Calabrese and Cardy light cone effects after quantum quenches have been analyzed in a number of lattice
models24–26,47,178–181 and observed in experiments on systems of ultra-cold atomic gases9,10 and trapped ions16,17. The experi-
mental work raises the poignant theoretical issue of which velocity underlies the observed light cone effect in non-relativistic
systems at ﬁnite energy densities. Here there is no unique velocity of light, and quasi-particles in interacting systems will gen-
erally have ﬁnite life times depending on the details of the initial density matrix. For the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ
chain, an integrable model, it was shown in Ref. 55 that the light cone propagation velocity in general depends on the energy
density of the initial state, and an explanation for this effect in terms of properties of stable excitations at ﬁnite energy densities
was put forward. More recent theoretical works address the inﬂuence of long-range interactions on the spreading of correla-
tions182–187. Sufﬁciently long-range interactions lead to a destruction of light cone effects. Non-relativistic continuum models
are also known to exhibit modiﬁcations to light cone behaviour107.

It is useful to contrast the above discussion to the spreading of correlations in equilibrium and after “local quantum
quenches”188. In the latter context one is concerned with the spreading of a local perturbation that has been imposed on an
equilibrium state. Light cone effects are observed in such situations as well, but the spreading occurs at the maximum group
velocity of elementary excitations over the equilibrium state that is being considered. In other words, unlike for global quantum
quenches, there is no factor of two.

A. Relation to Lieb-Robinson bounds

As shown by Lieb and Robinson189,190, the velocity of information transfer in quantum spin chains is effectively bounded.

More precisely, there exists a causal structure in commutators of local operators at different times

(cid:107)[OA(t),OB(0)](cid:107) ≤ c min(|A|,|B|) (cid:107)OA(cid:107) (cid:107)OB(cid:107) e

− L−vt

ξ

.

(101)

18

Here OA and OB are local operators acting non-trivially only in two subsystems A and B that are spatially separated by a
distance L, (cid:107).(cid:107) denotes the operator norm and |A| the number of sites in subsystem A. Finally, c, v and ξ are constants.
More recently, the Lieb-Robinson bounds have been reﬁned191,192 and extended to mixed state dynamics in open quantum
systems192,193.

The Lieb-Robinson bound has important consequences for quantum quenches starting in an initial state with ﬁnite correlation
length and time evolving with a local Hamiltonian. It was shown in Ref. 176 that (101) implies a bound on the connected
two-point correlation functions after such quenches

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|OA OB|Ψ(t)(cid:105)conn < ¯c(cid:0)

|A| + |B|

(cid:1) e

− L−2vt

χ

.

(102)

Here ¯c, v and χ are constants. The bound (102) shows that connected two-point functions of local operators after quantum
quenches in spin chains are exponentially small up to times t = L/2v. This tallies very nicely with the light cone effects
discussed above. We note that the bound does not provide a value for the velocity v.

B. Finite-size effects

Throughout our discussion we have stressed that we are ultimately interested in taking the thermodynamic limit. In a large
but ﬁnite system local observables can never truly relax. There always will be recurrences194 such that the return amplitude
F(t) = |(cid:104)Ψ(0)|Ψ(t)(cid:105)| is arbitrarily close to 1

|1 − F(t)| <  .

(103)

However, in many-particle systems these typically occur only at astronomically late times. The exception to this rule are cases in
which the spectrum of the post-quench Hamiltonian in a large, ﬁnite volume for some reason has a highly commensurate struc-
ture. A very simple example are Hamiltonians with equidistant energy levels En = E0 + nδ, for which we have F(2πj/δ) = 1.
A more relevant effect in practice are revivals, which refers to situations where F(t) = O(1). This again requires the ﬁnite
size energy spectrum to have a certain regularity, as is the case for example in conformal ﬁeld theories88.
A different ﬁnite-size effect affects all observables and is related to the light cone repeatedly traversing the system36,49,101,103.
We refer to this effect as a traversal. As an example we consider the connected two point function (95) on a ﬁnite ring. A density
plot is shown for a system of size L = 100 in Fig. 5. We see that the light cone traverses the system and induces a signal in

(a)

(b)

FIG. 5. (a) Same as Fig. 3 but for a ﬁnite system with L = 100 sites and periodic boundary conditions. At times Jt > 12.5 the light cone has
traversed the system and eventually causes a revival of the connected correlation function at a given separation (cid:96). This is strictly a ﬁnite-size
effect and has no analog in the thermodynamic limit. (b) s(t) = SL((cid:96) = 20, t) + |fL(20)|2 for L = 100 as a function of time.

SL((cid:96), t) at a time (L − |(cid:96)|)/2vmax after the light cone ﬁrst reaches. Clearly at times t > (L − |(cid:96)|)/2vmax correlation functions
of the ﬁnite system look very different from the ones in the thermodynamic limit. As is shown in Fig. 6, the traversal in not
associated with any revival, because the return amplitude remains exponentially small in the system size.

initial state remains negligible at any time t > 0.

VI. TRANSVERSE-FIELD ISING CHAIN (TFIC)

We now turn our attention to a key paradigm for quantum quenches, the transverse-ﬁeld Ising chain

2(cid:96)−1σy
σx
2(cid:96).

(105)

(cid:96)=1

(cid:96)=1

The Hamiltonian (104) has a Z2 symmetry of rotations by π around the z-axis. The ground state phase diagram of the TFIC
features paramagnetic (for h > 1) and ferromagnetic (for h < 1) phases, in which the Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken.
The two phases are separated by a quantum critical point at h = 1, which is described by the Ising conformal ﬁeld theory with
central charge c = 1/2, cf. Ref. 195.

It is well known that the TFIC admits a representation in terms of non-interacting fermions. However, the Jordan-Wigner
transformation between spins and fermions is nonlocal. This renders the TFIC an ideal testing ground for relaxation ideas, in
particular in relation to the crucial role played by locality.

The study of non-equilibrium dynamics in the TFIC was initiated in a seminal paper by Barouch, McCoy and Dresden in
197044. They analyzed the time evolution of the transverse magnetization (cid:104)Ψ(t)|σz
(cid:96)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) and observed that it relaxes to a non-
thermal value at late times. The focus of research on the TFIC and its two-dimensional classical counterpart then shifted to the
determination of equilibrium properties, and it took thirty years before the issue of relaxation after quantum quenches returned
to centre stage33,34. A combination of experimental advances in cold atom systems and the theoretical insights gained through
the study of quantum quenches in conformal ﬁeld theories79,86,87 revitalized the quest for obtaining a complete understanding
of the quench dynamics in the TFIC. Exact closed form expressions for the time evolution of the entanglement entropy after a
global quench were obtained in Ref. 47. By combining free-fermion techniques with numerical methods important insights on
thermalization issues were gained32, and ﬁnite-size effects like traversals were analyzed in detail36. Exact results for the time
evolution of order parameter correlations were ﬁnally obtained in Refs 24–26, and 39, and it was demonstrated that the stationary
state is described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. The time evolution of reduced density matrices was studied in Ref. 27, and
the question of which conservation laws are most important for characterizing the stationary state with a given accuracy was
resolved. Refs 38 and 49 introduced a semi-classical approach to quantum quenches by generalizing a method developed by
Sachdev in the context of equilibrium dynamics195. Dynamical (non-equal time) correlations were studied in Refs 28, 38, and 49
in relation to the question whether the stationary state fulﬁls a ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem. Progress on experimental studies
of non-equilibrium evolution in TFICs has been more limited. Ref. 11 reported results on quantum quenches in a cold atom
system described by one dimensional Bose Hubbard chains, which map onto the TFIC in a particular limit. Refs 196 proposed
a realization of the TFIC with a time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld in the framework of circuit QED.

A. Fermionic form of the Hamiltonian

20

Spin chains that can be mapped to free fermions differ in two important aspects from free fermion models like the one we

considered in Section IV:

- two-point functions of spin operators map onto n-point correlation functions of fermions, where n is related to the distance

between the two spins and can be arbitrarily large;

- The ground state of the TFIC in the ordered phase is not a Fock state (as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking).

The Hamiltonian (104) can be mapped to a fermionic theory by a Jordan-Wigner transformation

(108)

(109)

HR,NS commute with the fermion parity operator, and the full Hamiltonian (108) is therefore block-diagonal: HR (HNS) de-
scribes the action on states with an odd (even) number of fermions. We note that the free fermion Hamiltonians HNS/R are
closely related to the pairing model (83) considered earlier

HR = −H(−J,−2hJ) + JhL .

1. Ground states

(110)

The Hamiltonians HNS/R can be diagonalized by Bogoliubov transformations to canonical momentum space fermion opera-

1 + h2 − 2h cos k.

The difference between R and NS sectors enters via the allowed values of the momenta, which are p = πn
integers for R and NS fermions respectively. The ground states of HR,NS(h) are the fermionic vacua

L , where n are even/odd

bp|GS(cid:105)a = 0 ∀p ∈ a ,

a = R, NS.

(113)

eiπN

|GS(cid:105)R = sgn(h − 1)|GS(cid:105)R .

21

(114)

From (108) it follows that in the ferromagnetic phase h < 1 both fermion vacua are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian H. Their
respective energies are exponentially (in system size) close, and they become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit. Spin-ﬂip
symmetry then gets spontaneously broken, and the ground state is either the symmetric or the antisymmetric combination of the
two vacuuum states. In the paramagnetic phase h > 1 the ground state of H is given by the NS vacuum state. In summary, we
have

(cid:40) |GS(cid:105)NS±|GS(cid:105)R

√
|GS(cid:105)NS
This shows that for h < 1 the ground state of H is not a Fock state.

|GS(cid:105) =

2

h < 1
h > 1 .

(115)

B. Quantum quench of the transverse ﬁeld

We now consider the following quench protocol. We prepare the system in the ground state of H(h0), and at time t = 0
quench the transverse ﬁeld to a new value h. At times t > 0 we time evolve with the new Hamiltonian H(h). All local operators
in spin basis can be classiﬁed according to their fermion parity, and this turns out to be very useful. We have

eiπN

Oe/oeiπN = ±Oe/o.

(116)

1. Quenches originating in the paramagnetic phase

For a quench starting in the paramagnetic phase it follows from (115), (108) and (114) that the state of the system at times

t > 0 is given by

|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = e−iHt |GS(cid:105) ≡ e−iHNSt |GS(cid:105)NS .

(117)

This is even under fermion parity. Hence expectation values of odd operators must vanish

(118)
By virtue of the simple form (117) of both the time evolution operator HNS and the initial state |GS(cid:105)NS, expectation values
of even operators can be calculated by applying Wick’s theorem. This allows the reduction of expectation values of strings of
fermion operators to Pfafﬁans involving only the two-point functions (cid:104)aiaj(cid:105)45,46,197. For example we have

(cid:104)Ψ(t)|Oo|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = 0.

(119)

2. Quenches originating in the ferromagnetic phase

As a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ground state, the situation for quenches originating in the ferromagnetic

phase h0 < 1 is more complicated. The time evolved initial state is

√2
The expectation values of even operators can be expressed in the form

|Ψ(t)(cid:105) =

e−iHNSt |GS(cid:105)NS ± e−iHRt |GS(cid:105)R

.

−→L→∞ NS (cid:104)GS|eiHNStOee−iHNSt|GS(cid:105)NS .

(120)

(121)

In the last line we have used that the expectation values in the R and NS sectors become equal in the thermodynamic limit. The
last line in (121) can again be evaluated by application of Wick’s theorem.

In contrast, expectation of odd operators cannot be simpliﬁed in this way. Instead we have

(cid:104)GS|eiHtOoe−iHt|GS(cid:105) = ±Re[NS(cid:104)GS|eiHNStOoe−iHRt|GS(cid:105)R] .

Wick’s theorem does not apply here, and in order to proceed one commonly resorts to one of the following methods198.

22

(122)

1. Using the cluster decomposition property we can obtain (122) from the expectation value of an even operator by consid-

ering the limit

|(cid:104)GS|eiHtOoe−iHt|GS(cid:105)| = lim

d→∞

(cid:113)
NS(cid:104)GS|eiHNStOo(r)Oo(r + d)e−iHNSt|GS(cid:105)NS .

2. One imposes open boundary conditions on the spins (in that case the Hamiltonian is mapped into a purely quadratic form

of fermions) and considers the expectation value of Oo asymptotically far away from the boundaries.

An alternative method that applies more generally to integrable models was developed in Refs 24–26. It is based on the obser-
vation that the initial state after the quench can be expressed in a squeezed state form, e.g.

(cid:104)

(cid:88)

(cid:105)

|GS(cid:105)NS = exp

i

K(p)b†

†

|∅(cid:105)NS .

0<p∈NS
Here K(p) is a function that depends on the quench (cf. (132)), b†
p are the aforementioned momentum space Bogoliubov fermion
operators and |∅(cid:105)NS is the corresponding vacuum state. Two point correlation functions can then be written in a Lehmann
representation based on energy eigenstates. The matrix elements (“form factors”) in the Lehmann representation are known199,
and it is possible to obtain explicit results in the framework of a low-density expansion. We refer the reader to Refs 25 and 26
for further details and the explicit calculations. Here we only review and discuss the main results.

(123)

(124)

C. Stationary state properties

Stationary state properties were analyzed in detail in Ref. 26. An important simpliﬁcation at late times is that expectation
values of odd operators go to zero. As discussed above, for quenches originating in the paramagnetic phase they vanish identi-
cally because the Z2 symmetry remains unbroken. On the other hand, for quenches originating in ferromagnetic phase (h0 < 1)
their expectation value is generally nonzero (cf. (122)). However, as shown in Ref. 27, expectation values of all odd local
operators decay exponentially in time to zero. This leaves us with expectation values for even operators, which can be analyzed
by standard free fermion methods. The basic object is the fermion two-point function, which in the thermodynamic limit can be
written in the form (cf. (91))

Since the expectation value of any even local operator can always be written as a ﬁnite sum of ﬁnite products of fermion two-
point functions (cf. (119)), the inﬁnite time limit exists and is obtained by replacing (125) with (126). Courtesy of Wick’s
theorem, the stationary properties of all other even operators can be expressed in terms of (126).

1. Description of the steady state by a GGE

Since expectation values of odd operators vanish at inﬁnite times, the steady state can be constructed in complete analogy to

our fermionic example considered in Sec. IV. The appropriate GGE density matrix is of the form

D. Time dependence

Having established the stationary behaviour of spin correlations, we now turn to their dynamics at late times. The ﬁrst question

of interest is how they relax towards their stationary values.

For even operators we can use Wick’s theorem to express their expectation values in terms of the fermion two-point functions

(125). At late times the resulting expression can be evaluated by a stationary phase approximation, which gives

Here the exponent n[Oe] is an integer that depends on the particular even operator under consideration.

Expectation values of odd operators were argued in Ref. 27 to decay exponentially in time

quantitative description.

j=1 aj is the simplest and most important
example of an odd operator. Its expectation value is the order parameter in the ferromagnetic phase. As we are dealing with an
odd operator, its expectation value is identically zero for quenches originating in the paramagnetic phase. For quenches from the
ferromagnetic phase (h0 < 1) it was shown in Ref. 24 and 25 that

The oscillatory behaviour for h > 1 can be related to the presence of a gapless mode with momentum k0 in the GGE Hamiltonian
(130) (K 2(k0) = 1). It was noted in Ref. 41 that the period of the oscillations in (141) coincides with cusps in the time evolution

the phases. The result (139) has been derived in the late time limit Jt (cid:29) 1. However, it gives an excellent account of the full
answer except at very short times. This can be shown by comparing (139) to a numerical solution based on free fermion
methods25. The latter works directly in the thermodynamic limit and does not suffer from ﬁnite-size effects. Fig. 7 shows such
comparisons for two different quenches within the ferromagnetic phase, and for two quenches from the ferromagnetic to the
paramagnetic phase. The agreement is visibly excellent even at moderate times.

FIG. 7.
Expectation value of the order parameter after two quenches within the ferromagnetic phase (left) and two quenches across the
critical point (right). Numerical results obtained in the thermodynamic limit are compared with the asymptotic predictions (139) (labelled
as “determinant”). In the left panel analytic results obtained by form factor methods25 are shown as well (labelled as “form factor”). The
agreement in all cases is excellent even at the short times depicted. [Figures taken from Ref. 25]

At ﬁrst sight the exponential decay (139) of the order parameter for quenches within the ferromagnetic phase may look sur-
prising. Even a very small quench will lead to the eventual disappearance of the order parameter. A simple way of understanding
this is to note that the ferromagnetic order persists only at zero temperature T = 0, and melts for any T > 0. By means of
our quantum quench we deposit a ﬁnite energy density into the system, which is very similar to imposing a ﬁnite temperature.
This consideration provides an intuitive explanation for why even small quenches wipe out the long range order present in the
initial state. We note that this behaviour is speciﬁc to one dimensional systems, where discrete symmetries can be spontaneously
broken only at T = 0. In higher dimensional systems we expect order parameters to be generally stable when subjected to
sufﬁciently small quantum quenches.

The relaxation to the stationary value is only algebraic, in agreement with (137).

2. Spin-spin correlators in the “space-time scaling limit”

A particularly useful way of description of the time dependence of two-point functions after a quantum quench is by con-
sidering an asymptotic expansion around the so-called space-time scaling limit24,25. The latter refers to the behaviour along a
particular ray in space-time

by means of a simple application of Wick’s theorem followed by a stationary phase approximation. The leading behaviour is a
t−1 power-law decay and the subleading corrections are power laws as well25

the form

ρxx((cid:96), t) (cid:39) Cx((cid:96), t) exp
The function Cx((cid:96), t) has been determined in Ref. 25.

1. For quenches within the ferromagnetic phase, h0, h < 1, Cx((cid:96), t) equals the constant denoted by Cx

smaller than the Fermi time

FF in (C3). For times

tF =

(cid:96)

2vmax

,

(147)

(146) equals the square of the one-point function (139). Thus, in the space-time scaling limit, connected correlations
vanish identically for times t < tF and begin to form only after the Fermi time. We stress that this does not imply that
the connected correlations are exactly zero for t < tF : in any model, both on the lattice or in the continuum there are
exponentially suppressed terms (in (cid:96)), which however vanish in the scaling limit.

2. For quenches from the ferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic phase the prefactor is given by

where Cx
FP is the constant deﬁned in (C4), while k0 and α are the constants appearing in the one-point function (141).
For t < tF , (146) is simply the square of the corresponding one-point function, which ensures that connected correlations
vanish for t < tF in the space-time scaling regime. We note that the expression for t < tF is a conjecture25.

4. For quenches from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase, for t > tF , Cx((cid:96), t) is independent of time and is given
PF((cid:96)) of (C5). For t < tF the correlator is exponentially small and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no analytic

3. Long time asymptotics of connected spin-spin correlators at a ﬁxed separation (cid:96)

This implies that the time scale after which the stationary behaviour becomes apparent is in fact exponentially large in the
separation (cid:96). This makes the stationary behaviour difﬁcult to observe in practice.

2. For quenches originating in the ferromagnetic phase, the stationary value of ρxx((cid:96), t) emerges at a time scale

F ∼ v−1

(152)

where vmax is the maximal velocity at which information propagates. This makes the approach to the steady state straight-

3. For quenches within the paramagnetic phase, ρxx

c ((cid:96), t) exhibits an oscillatory power-law decay in time towards its station-
ary value, which is exponentially small in (cid:96). Hence, in complete analogy to the case of the transverse two-point function,
the time scale τ x

PP after which the stationary behavior reveals itself, is exponentially large

and very difﬁcult to observe in practice.

E. Reduced density matrices

As we have seen above, the quench dynamics of one and two point functions of quantum spins is rich and interesting. However,
these are nonetheless very special observables. Ideally one would like to have access to the time evolution to the full reduced
density matrix for a given subsystem size, as its matrix elements encode the evolution of all correlation functions, cf. (21).
In practice this is only possible in very simple non-interacting examples, or for very small subsystem sizes. An example are
quenches in the disordered phase of the TFIC27,172. Here the reduced density matrix on the interval [1, (cid:96)] is given by

where the time evolved initial state |Ψ(t)(cid:105) is given by (117). The matrix elements of the correlation matrix are simple (single)
integrals and can be found in Ref. 25.
As we have argued above, at late times after global quantum quenches isolated quantum systems relax locally towards some
steady states ρSS. How quickly this relaxation occurs can be efﬁciently measured by considering the distance of the time evolving
reduced density matrix ρB(t) from its steady state value ρSS
B , where B is a subsystem of a given size. This diagnostic can be
implemented quite generally numerically as long as the subsystem size is small201. For models that can be mapped to non-
interacting theories, it is possible to go considerably further. An example is the TFIC, which was considered in Ref. 27. The ﬁrst
step is to introduce a measure of distance on the space of RDMs on a given subsystem. A convenient choice was introduced in
Ref. 27

(cid:115)

D(ρ1, ρ2) =

Tr[(ρ1 − ρ2)2]

(156)

Fig. 8 shows results for the distance between the RMDs for the time-evolving and stationary states for quantum quenches within
the disordered and ordered phases in the TFIC. Subsystems consisting of (cid:96) neighbouring sites are considered, where (cid:96) ranges
from 10 to 150. In both cases the distance is seen to eventually decay as a power law in time

FIG. 8. Normalized distance D(GGE) = D(ρ(cid:96)(t), ρGGE
) after a quench within the paramagnetic (left) and ferromagnetic (right) phase for
subsystem sizes (cid:96) = 10, 20, . . . , 150. As (cid:96) increases, the color changes from brown to green, the symbols become smaller and the curves
) tends to zero in a universal power-law fashion ∝ (Jt)−3/2. For quenches in the ordered phase
narrower. At late times D(ρ(cid:96)(t), ρ(GGE)
there is an intermediate time regime, in which the distance decays exponentially (inset). This stems from the non-vanishing spontaneous
magnetization in the initial state for this quench. [Figures taken from Ref. 27]

The power-law decay of the distance in time can be interpreted by relating it to expectation values of local operators in the
subsystem. Using (21) one can show that

expectation value. This shows that (158) measures a mean relative difference between the expectation values of local operators
in the two states.

The von Neumann entropy (also known as entanglement entropy) of a density matrix ρ is deﬁned as

F. Entanglement entropy

SvN[ρ] = −Tr[ρ log ρ] .

(161)

If ρ is a reduced density matrix in a system that is in a pure state, SvN measures the entanglement between the subsystem
and its complement. Entanglement entropies have become a standard diagnostic for detecting and identifying quantum phase
transitions. In the context of quantum quenches the time evolution of the von Neumann entropy and other entanglement measures
provides very useful information about the spreading of correlations16,30,47,86,106,124,178,179,202–205. A key result obtained in Ref. 47
is that after quenches to conformal ﬁeld theories the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of length (cid:96) increases linearly in time
until it eventually saturates (see the review by P. Calabrese and J. Cardy in this volume)

speed of light. The two behaviours in (162) connect smoothly over a region |vt − (cid:96)
result (162) is provided by the Calabrese-Cardy quasi-particle picture86 we already encountered in Section V. Its application to
the time evolution of the entanglement entropy in integrable models initialized in squeezed states with ﬁnite correlation length
proceeds as follows. The idea is that in a squeezed state correlations spread via the propagation of pairs of quasi-particles with
equal but opposite momenta. At time t = 0 the quantum quench generates such quasi-particles pairs throughout the system.
Correlations between quasi-particles produced at a distance larger than the correlation length of the initial state can be neglected.
The entanglement between a given region B and its complement is generated by quasi-particle pairs. The entanglement entropy
is interpreted as a measure of the number of correlated pairs such that, at a given time, one quasi-particle is inside B and one
outside, see Fig. 9. Entanglement is initially generated at the boundaries of B, and the entangled region spreads outwards in the
form of two light cones. This picture suggests the following semiclassical expression for the von Neumann entropy

This behaviour has been observed in a variety of lattice and continuum models30,47,86,106,124,178,179,202,205, including non-
integrable cases179, in which the quasi-particle picture does not apply by virtue of the ﬁnite quasi-particle life time. The
semiclassical interpretation has been generalized to prethermalized regimes in models with weak integrability breaking124.

The linear entanglement growth after quantum quenches has important ramiﬁcations. It is a crucial limiting factor for applying
matrix-product state methods such as t-DRMG206 and i iTEBD207 algorithms to the computation of the dynamics after global
quantum quenches. We note that translational invariance is essential for the quasi-particle picture to hold, and the time evolution
of the entanglement entropy in e.g. disordered models202 is very different.

Exact results for the evolution of the entanglement entropy after quenches in the transverse ﬁeld Ising chain47 are in accordance
with the structure (163) suggested by the quasi-particle picture. In the limit 1 (cid:28) (cid:96), Jt, the entanglement entropy of a block of (cid:96)

Quasi-particles moving at the maximal group velocity are indicated by thick black arrows, and are initially generated throughout the system by
the quantum quench. Slower quasi-particles are shown only on the left (short dashed gray arrows). At time ta the entanglement entropy of B
is still increasing linearly in time, as there are still trajectories such that maximum velocity quasi-particle pairs are incident inside B. At times
t = tb the entanglement entropy starts saturating because any maximum velocity quasi-particle incident in B generates entanglement with the
rest of the system.

where K 2(k) was deﬁned previously in (132). It follows from (164) that the entanglement entropy increases linearly until the
Fermi time (147), and then slowly approaches its stationary value set by the GGE. The latter equals the entropy per site of the
GGE for the entire system106

These observations persist for quantum quenches in the TFIC starting in excited states30.

Interestingly, the stationary value of the entropy density in the diagonal ensemble differs from that in the GGE29,208. This is
not a problem, because the entropy per site is a global property of the system, while the equivalence between ensembles only
holds for (ﬁnite) subsystems in the thermodynamic limit. A detailed explanation of the origin of this difference for the case of
the TFIC was provided in Ref. 29.

G. Dynamical spin-spin correlation functions

We now turn to dynamical correlation functions

ραα((cid:96), t + t1, t + t2) = (cid:104)Ψ(t)|σα

j+(cid:96)(t1)σα

j (t2)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) .

(167)

The transverse correlator (α = z in (167)) can be calculated by elementary means44, as σz
j is quadratic in Jordan-Wigner
fermions. The order parameter correlator (α = x in (167)) is much more difﬁcult to evaluate. In Ref. 28 it was determined by
means of a generalization of the form factor methods developed in Ref. 25, and by exploiting exact results in particular limits26.
These methods are so far restricted to quenches within either the paramagnetic or the ferromagnetic phase, and lead to answers
of the form28

(169)

In the complementary regime vmax(2t + τ ) < (cid:96) the correlator is exponentially small and this expression no longer applies.
The form factor result gives an excellent approximation to the exact answer (which can be computed numerically using free
fermion techniques) for “small” quenches28. These are deﬁned as being characterized by having low densities of excitations in
the initial state.

It is possible to obtain some of these results in an alternative way by generalizing the semiclassical approach of Ref. 38 to the
non-equal time case, and then elevating it using exact limiting results derived in Refs 24 and 25. This method fails to reproduce
the result for quenches in the disordered phase outside the light cone vmaxτ < (cid:96), but is signiﬁcantly simpler.

VII. RELAXATION IN INTERACTING INTEGRABLE MODELS

We now turn to interacting integrable models that are solvable by the Bethe Ansatz19,209,210. By “interacting” we mean
theories in which the scattering matrix is momentum dependent. Most of our discussion will focus on the example of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.

A. The “initial state problem”

Integrability allows the construction of a basis of simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and all its conservation laws.
Unlike in the non-interacting case these states have a very complicated structure described by the Bethe Ansatz19,209,210. When
we consider a quench between two integrable Hamiltonians H(h0) → H(h), we are thus faced with the problem of how to
translate between the eigenbases of the two integrable theories. This is a difﬁcult undertaking211,212, and no general formalism
for achieving it is currently known. Progress has however been made in cases where the initial state has a simpler structure, in
particular for (matrix) product states in either position57,62,64,65,67,68 or momentum/rapidity space92,94,102,104,108,110,111. There are
two main methods for encoding the relevant information contained in the initial state.

1. Let us denote the eigenstates of the post-quench Hamiltonian H(h) by |n(cid:105). One way to implement the initial conditions is
via the overlaps (cid:104)n|Ψ(0)(cid:105)66. If these are known, the initial state can be translated into the eigenbasis of the time evolution
operator. This method is used in the Quench Action Approach172 (see the review by J.-S. Caux in this volume).

2. Let us denote the local conservation laws of H(h) by {I (n)}. If the set {I (n)} is in some sense complete109,213,214, then

the initial conditions can be encoded in the constraints

where ρSS is one of the density matrices (GGE, GMC, diagonal ensemble) that describes the local properties of the
stationary state.

In the following we will discuss implementations of the second approach.

B. On mode occupation operators

In free theories a convenient way for constructing the GGE is by exploiting the linear relation between the local conservation
laws and the mode occupation operators, cf. (42). In interacting integrable models the situation is different. Like free theories
they feature stable excitations. In the thermodynamic limit these can be described by creation and annihilation operators Z†
a(λ),

ab(λ1, λ2) is the purely elastic two-particle S-matrix. The generalized mode
Here λ parametrizes the momenta pa(λ) and Scd
occupation operators Na(λ) = Z†
a(λ)Za(λ) then indeed provide a set of mutually commuting conserved charges. The problem
is that, due to the interacting nature of the stable excitations, there is no simple way of deﬁning such operators in the ﬁnite
volume92, which is the standard way of making the theory well deﬁned (working directly in the thermodynamic limit requires
the regularization of very complicated singularities39,92,217, which appears impractical in general). The problem lies in the nature
of the quantization conditions in the ﬁnite volume, which on a ring of length L read

The solutions to this complicated system of coupled equations are such that the possible values of λ(a)

depend in a very sensitive way on all the other particles present in a given excitation. This is fundamentally different from the
non-interacting case, where the momenta are simply given by

and are independent of the particle content of a given excitation. This makes it clear that deﬁning ﬁnite volume analogues of

1. Generalized microcanonical ensemble

For interacting integrable models the GMC is easier to work with than the GGE. It is based on working with macro-states
obtained by taking the thermodynamic limit of eigenstates constructed from the Bethe Ansatz. This procedure is an essen-
tial ingredient of the Thermodyamic Bethe Ansatz and is reviewed in several monographs209,220. A very brief summary is
given in Appendix C 1. The upshot is that macro-states in integrable models are characterized by an (inﬁnite) set of densities
{ρn,p(λ)|n = 1, 2, . . .}, where n labels all distinct stable species of excitations in the model. A given macro-state corresponds
to a set of micro-states |Φ(cid:105), called representative states in Ref. 172. These are by construction simultaneous eigenstates of all
local conservation laws. For the macro-state describing the stationary state after our quench, they satisfy the initial conditions

L→∞ (cid:104)ΦSS|I (n)|ΦSS(cid:105)

lim

L

= lim

L→∞ (cid:104)Ψ(0)|I (n)|Ψ(0)(cid:105)

.

The GMC density matrix is then deﬁned172 in terms of a single such “representative” micro-state |ΦSS(cid:105)

ρGMC = |ΦSS(cid:105)(cid:104)ΦSS| .

(176)

(177)

Here we have assumed that the stationary state is given in terms of a single macro-state constructed from the Bethe Ansatz. In
principle it is possible that the steady state has a more complicated structure and requires a description in terms of a sum of
several density matrices of the form (177).

2. Transfer matrix and “ultra-local” conservation laws

32

According to our general discussion, local observables should relax to an appropriate GGE after quenches to the XXZ chain.
In order to construct this GGE, we need to know the required set of local conservation laws of (174). One family of conser-
vation laws has been known for a long time and is most conveniently constructed by exploiting the relation of the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian to the transfer matrix of the six-vertex model19,218,219. The fundamental building block of the six-vertex model is
the L-operator

Ln(λ) =

which acts on the tensor product C2⊗C2 of “auxiliary” and “quantum” spaces through the Pauli matrices τ α and σα respectively.
Matrix elements in the auxiliary/quantum spaces are denotes by Roman/Greek letters respectively, e.g.

(180)

By virtue of the commutation relations (182) it is clear that a set of mutually commuting operators can be obtained by taking

laws are sometimes referred to as ultra-local. They have been studied extensively in the literature19,221–223. We note that the
above construction is not restricted to Heisenberg models, but works much more generally19.

3. “Ultra-local” GGE

33

According to our general discussion, the GGE describing the steady state after a quench to the Heisenberg model should
contain all of the conservation laws (184). An important question is whether these conservation laws are also sufﬁcient. This
was investigated in Refs 57, 58, and 62. The basic idea is as follows. One considers time evolution induced by the Hamiltonian
(174) starting from an initial state |Ψ(0)(cid:105). The quantities of interest are the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix on a
short interval in the steady state, cf. (21)

The question is whether these expectation values can be obtained, to a given accuracy, from a GGE density matrix of the form

(188)

In practice it is very difﬁcult to determine the Lagrange multipliers from these conditions, even for very simple initial states
|Ψ(0)(cid:105). A method to circumvent this problem was developed in Ref. 57. The idea is to deﬁne a generating function for the initial
values (188)

For large L (and real λ) the inverse of the transfer matrix becomes

Using the expression (180) of the transfer matrix as a product of L-operators, the generating function can be expressed in the
form

where Vn(x, λ) are 4× 4 matrices with entries (Vn(x, λ))ab
n, and Sp denotes the usual trace for 4 × 4 matrices. The explicit expression is

(192)

The advantage of representation (191) is that it can be efﬁciently evaluated for initial states |Ψ(0)(cid:105) of matrix product form57,62.
To understand the principle behind this let us consider a translationally invariant product state

In this case the generating function is obtained from the eigenvalues of the 4 × 4 matrix U (x, λ) = 1(cid:104)ψ|V1(x, λ)|ψ(cid:105)1 as

An efﬁcient algorithm for calculating Ω( 1

Ψ(0)(λ) for matrix-product states was given in Ref. 62. Having encoded the “initial
data” of our quantum quench in the generating function Ω( 1
2 )
Ψ(0)(λ), we now move on to the calculation of expectation values of

34

y(cid:88)

local operators in the state given by (187). A very useful observation is that ρ(y)
“Hamiltonian”

ulGGE can be viewed as a Gibbs ensemble for the

Heﬀ =

2 )

(195)

k=1

at an effective inverse temperature β = 1. As all H (k, 1
2 ) commute and are obtained by taking logarithmic derivatives of the
transfer matrix, ﬁnite temperature properties of (195) can be studied by standard methods221,224. The Quantum Transfer Matrix
approach (QTM)225 is particularly useful in this regard, as it provides an efﬁcient way to obtain explicit results for thermal
averages of local operators226,227 (see also Ref. 228). Refs 57, 58, and 62 employed the QTM approach to the calculation of
steady state properties of the density matrix (187) for quenches from simple initial states. By employing the generating function
(189), it is possible to take into account all ultra-local conservation laws, and arrive at explicit results for local observables
without having to determine the Lagrange multipliers λ(∞)
57. In the QTM approach the stationary state is described in terms
of the solution of a system of coupled, nonlinear integral equations. Remarkably, the information on the initial state enters
this system only via the function Ω( 1
2 )
Ψ(0)(λ). Results for spin correlators obtained in this way were compared to t-DMRG
computations for quenches from a variety of initial states in Ref. 62, and found to be compatible within the limitations of the
numerical analysis.

The subsequent application of the Quench Action Approach172 (reviewed by J.-S. Caux in this volume) to the same problem
revealed that the ultra-local GGE in fact does not correctly describe the steady state for quenches to the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
chain64,65,67–69, although it does provide a very good approximation for e.g. quenches from the N´eel state. This suggested the
existence of hitherto unknown conservation laws in the Heisenberg chain, which need to be taken into account in the construction
of the GGE.

4. “Quasi-local” GGE

The “missing” conservation laws for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain were discovered in Refs 63 and 229. Their structure
is quite different from that of the ultra-local conservation laws discussed above: their densities are not local in the sense that they
act non-trivially only on a ﬁnite number of neighbouring sites, but quasilocal. Similar conservation laws had been identiﬁed
earlier in relation to transport properties of the Heisenberg chain230. In order to deﬁne the concept of quasi-locality one introduces
an inner product on the space of operators by

(A, B) = (cid:104)A†B(cid:105)∞ ,

(cid:104)A(cid:105)∞ =

2L Tr(cid:0)A(cid:1).

An operator Q is called quasi-local if it fulﬁls the following two conditions:

where Bk is any operator that acts non-trivially only on a ﬁxed number of k sites. In the anisotropic Heisenberg chain quasi-local
charges can be constructed as follows63,229. It is well known that the six-vertex model transfer matrix (180) is part of a much
larger family, built from the L-operators

which again acts on the tensor product of auxiliary and quantum spaces, but now the auxiliary space is 2S + 1 dimensional. Here
S is an arbitrary half integer. The operators S α obey a q-deformed SU(2) algebra

where [x]q = sinh(ηx)/ sinh(η), and act on a q-deformed spin-S representation as

relation form a commuting family

[τS(λ), τS(cid:48)(µ)] = 0.

(202)

By virtue of the commutation relations (182) it is clear that a set of mutually commuting operators can be obtained by taking

higher derivatives, i.e.

In the thermodynamic limit this can be simpliﬁed by following through the usual logic of the string hypothesis and the Ther-

states |ρ(cid:105), which are described by sets {ρn,p(λ)|n = 1, . . .} of particle densities or the equivalent set of hole densities
{ρn,h(λ)|n = 1, . . .}. The eigenvalue equation (207) then becomes63

where a2S(λ) is a function independent of the initial state that is deﬁned in Appendix C 1. This shows that the initial data
(206), which involves both ultra-local and quasi-local conservation laws, completely determines the macro-state that deﬁnes
the generalized microcanonical ensemble. We note that the derivation did not invoke the maximum entropy principle. For the
particular case of quenches from the N´eel state (210) agrees with the one obtained by the Quench Action Approach64,65,67,68.

The generalization of the approach discussed above for quenches to particular values of ∆ with −1 < ∆ < 1 in the Heisenberg

model (174) was achieved in Ref. 232 .

VIII. OUTLOOK

We have given an introduction to quantum quenches in many-particle systems and then reviewed recent developments, fo-
cussing in particular on the role played by conservation laws. In spite of the impressive progress of the last few years, many
important questions remain largely open. Let us list a few of them in no particular order.

1. In the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain quasi-local conservation laws have been shown to play a prominent role in deter-
mining the stationary state. It is believed that this holds quite generally in interacting integrable models. The construction
used in the XXZ case can in principle be generalized to the sl(M|N ) family of integrable graded quantum “spin” chains,
see e.g. Refs 233, and it would be interesting to investigate the role of quasi-local charges in such models. The Hubbard
model is another very interesting case, but is like to be more difﬁcult to handle due to its non standard structure209.

2. So far only particularly simple classes of initial states can be accommodated, cf. Section VII A. It would be highly desirable

to have a more general method for capturing the information on the initial state.

3. In interacting theories the focus has so far been on stationary state properties. The study of the full time evolution of
observables is much less developed92,110,234,235. A promising method for analyzing the time dependence of the expectation
values of local operators after a quantum quench in an interacting integrable theory is the Quench Action approach172. So
far it has been implemented only in a very small number of cases92,110, and further studies are sorely needed.

4. As we have seen, the non-equilibrium dynamics of integrable and non-integrable models is quite different. This poses
the question of what happens, when one adds a small perturbation to an integrable model. This has been investigated
in a number of theoretical works50,124,154,236–255, and is of immediate experimental relevance256,257. The generic effect of
adding a small integrability breaking term appears to be the generation of an intermediate “prethermalization” time scale,
below which the system retains information about being proximate in parameter space to an integrable model. At late
times thermalization seems to set in154. So far the theoretical analyses are restricted to weak interactions and/or short
times, and it is crucial to go beyond these limitations.

Appendix A: Requirements on the initial state

1. Cluster decomposition

We have deﬁned our quench protocol such that it results in initial states |Ψ(0)(cid:105) that have a cluster decomposition property
(12). This requirement is often relaxed in both numerical and analytical investigations, and in some cases |Ψ(0)(cid:105) is taken to be
a Schr¨odinger cat state, see e.g. Refs 64, 65, 67, and 68. An example is provided by quenches where the system is initialized in

37

a classical N´eel state | ↑↓↑↓ . . .(cid:105). This breaks translational invariance and it can be calculationally convenient to work instead
with a translationally invariant cat state

1
√2

(| ↑↓↑↓↑ . . .(cid:105) + | ↓↑↓↑↓ . . .(cid:105)) .

(A1)

While for speciﬁc calculations such replacements can be useful, they signiﬁcantly affect the steady state behaviour in general.
This can be seen by considering a Z2 symmetric pre-quench Hamiltonian H0 with a ground state that spontaneously breaks the
Z2 symmetry. An example is provided by the transverse-ﬁeld Ising chain (104) with h < 1. In the thermodynamic limit H0 has
two ground states |Ψ±(cid:105), both of which have a cluster decomposition property. We now consider a general linear combination

(A2)
As |Ψ±(cid:105) are macroscopically distinct (as they lead to different order parameters), we conclude that expectation values of local
operators O are given by

|Ψ(0)(cid:105) = cos θ |Ψ+(cid:105) + eiφ sin θ |Ψ−(cid:105) .

(cid:104)Ψ(0)|O|Ψ(0)(cid:105) = cos2 θ (cid:104)Ψ+|O|Ψ+(cid:105) + sin2 θ (cid:104)Ψ−|O|Ψ−(cid:105) .

As the Hamiltonian of our system is short ranged, this decomposition persists at all ﬁnite times, i.e.
(cid:104)Ψ(t)|O|Ψ(t)(cid:105) = cos2 θ (cid:104)Ψ+(t)|O|Ψ+(t)(cid:105) + sin2 θ (cid:104)Ψ−(t)|O|Ψ−(t)(cid:105)

(A3)

(A4)

To see this, we may use a result derived in Ref. 176 for the time evolution of local operators with short-ranged Hamiltonians:
restricting O(t) = eiHtOe−iHt to a subsystem S of size |S| gives an error that scales as e(2vt−|S|)/ζ, where ζ is a constant and
v is the Lieb-Robinson velocity. This means that it is possible to approximate O(t) to a given accuracy by a local operator of a
“size” that scales as 2vt/ζ. This in turn implies that (cid:104)Ψ+|O(t)|Ψ−(cid:105) = 0, because |Ψ±(cid:105) are macroscopically distinct.

On the other hand, our system relaxes locally by construction if we initialize it in |Ψ±(0)(cid:105), i.e.

Putting everything together we conclude that

t→∞|Ψ±(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ±(t)| =loc ρSS± .

t→∞|Ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ(t)| =loc ρSS = cos2 θρSS

(A5)

(A6)

The problem is that this form of the stationary state can be different from what one would expect on the basis of local relaxation
to (generalized) Gibbs ensembles. To be speciﬁc, we consider the example of a quench to an anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg
chain

Our initial state is of the form (A2), where |Ψ±(0)(cid:105) are the two ground states of the TFIC in the thermodynamic limit at h < 1.
We note that the energy density e of (A7) is the same in both |Ψ±(cid:105). As these states have a cluster decomposition property, it
follows from our general discussion that the respective stationary states are locally equivalent to grand canonical ensembles

where the values for β± and µ± are obtained by ﬁxing the energy density e and charge density q± to agree with their initial

Crucially, while the density matrices ρGC± have the cluster decomposition property, ρSS does not. This can be seen as follows.

On the other hand, if we were to apply our formalism of local relaxation blindly to our Hamiltonian (A7), we would conclude
that the stationary state is locally equivalent to a grand canonical ensemble, which is expected to have a cluster decomposition
property259.

Our discussion can be summarized as follows: If there exists at least one integral of motion that distinguishes |Ψ−(cid:105) from
|Ψ+(cid:105), the stationary state associated with the time evolution of the cat state (A2) does not possess the cluster decomposition
property (12) and hence is not described by a standard generalized Gibbs ensemble.

2. Probability distributions of energy and conservation laws

Let us consider a post-quench Hamiltonian H with a set of local conservation laws I (n), cf. (31), (32). In our basic deﬁnition
of a quantum quench we initialize the system in a pure state |Ψ(0)(cid:105). Then the cluster decomposition property implies that the
probability distribution of energy and all local conservation laws approach delta-functions in the thermodynamic limit, e.g.

(A14)

(cid:104)

ρ(0)I (n)(cid:105)

where ρ(0) = |Ψ(0)(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ(0)|. As we have pointed out, it is sometimes desirable to consider initial density matrices ρ(0) that are
not pure states. When doing so one must ensure that (A14) continues to hold. In cases where it does not it is clearly impossible
for the system to locally relax to a GGE, because there the probability distributions of all conservation laws approach delta
functions in the thermodynamic limit. Generalizations of GGE ideas to such cases have been explored in Ref. 258 .

Appendix B: “Atypical” macro-states in integrable models

Integrable models have the unusual property of having atypical ﬁnite entropy eigenstates at ﬁnite energy densities. This is

well known for non-interacting theories and we discuss this case ﬁrst.

1. Free fermions

Let us consider a model of free fermions with Hamiltonian

(cid:88)

(k)n(k) ,

where n(k) = c†(k)c(k). Imposing periodic boundary conditions quantizes the allowed momenta

approach smooth functions in the thermodynamic limit N, L → ∞, n = N/L ﬁxed. For such states, the number of particles in
the interval [kn, kn + ∆k] for large L is given by

ρp(kn)∆k .

(B4)

It is convenient to deﬁne a hole density by ρh(kj) = 1
2π − ρp(kj). In the thermodynamic limit many different choices of {kj}
lead to the same macro-state described by a given particle density. To enumerate them we note that the number of different
states in the interval [k, k + ∆k], that give rise to a given density in the thermodynamic limit, is obtained by distributing

ρp(k)L∆k particles among(cid:0)ρp(k) + ρh(k)(cid:1)L∆k vacancies. This follows a binomial distribution. For large L the latter may be

approximated by Stirling’s formula, and in the thermodynamic limit one obtains the well-known expression for the entropy per
site

dk(cid:2)(cid:0)ρp(k) + ρh(k)(cid:1) ln(cid:0)ρp(k) + ρh(k)(cid:1)

By construction the macro-state (B7) is the typical state at energy density (B8): if we randomly pick an energy eigenstates with
energy density e for a very large system size L, the probability for this state to have particle density (B7) is exponentially close
(in L) to one. On the other hand, there are atypical ﬁnite entropy macro-states characterized by their respective particle densities
ρp(k). As a particular example we consider our tight-binding model (40) for µ = 0, which gives a dispersion (k) = −2J cos(k).
We ﬁx the particle density to be 1/2 and the energy density to be e = −0.405838J, which corresponds to temperature T = J in
(B7), (B8), i.e.

(B11)

Fixing λ = 2.43096.. gives us the same particle and energy densities as for the equilibrium state, i.e. n = 1/2 and e =
−0.405838J. The entropy density s = 0.396781 is of course lower than that of the (maximum entropy) equilibrium state. This
means that if we randomly select an energy eigenstate with particle density n = 1/2 and energy density e = −0.405838J for a
very large system size L, we are exponentially more likely by a factor eL(seq−s) to end up with a state described by (B10) than
one described by (B11). Unsurprisingly, expectation values of local operators are generally different in the two macro-states. As
an example, let us consider

Here the expectation values may be taken with regards to any micro-state that gives rise to the appropriate macro-state in the
thermodynamic limit.

Interacting theories: anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model

The situation in integrable models is analogous to what we just discussed for free fermions. The main difference arises
from the more complicated structure and interacting nature of the elementary excitations in integrable models. For the sake
of deﬁniteness we consider the particular example of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model (174) with ∆ ≥ 1. Energy eigenstates
|λ1, . . . , λM(cid:105) on a ring of length L are parametrized by M rapidity variables λj, which fulﬁl the quantization conditions220

Each λj is associated with an elementary “magnon” excitation over the ferromagnetic state with all spins up, and the total energy
j=1 p(λj). As a result of interactions, magnons form

bound states. These correspond to “string solutions” of the quantization conditions (C7)

where δn,j
α are deviations from “ideal” strings that become negligible when we take the thermodynamic limit at ﬁnite densities
of magnons and bound states, cf. 6.2.A of Ref. 260. As a consequence of integrability these bound states are stable excitations.
The generalization of particle density description of macro-states in free theories to interacting integrable models is then clear:
macro-states are characterized by an (inﬁnite) set of densities {ρn,p(λ)|n = 1, 2, . . .} for magnons (n = 1) and bound states
of all lengths (n ≥ 2). Just as in the case of free fermions, we can deﬁne corresponding hole densities ρn,h(λ). The relation
between particle and hole densities is ﬁxed by the quantization conditions (C7)

ρn,t(λ) ≡ ρn,p(λ) + ρn,h(λ) = an(λ) −

dµ Anm(λ − µ)ρm,p(µ) ,

(C9)

cosh(nη)−cos(2λ). Eqn
where Anm(λ) = (1−δn,m)a|n−m|(λ)+2a|n−m|+2(λ)+···+2an+m−2(λ)+an+m(λ) and an(λ) = 1
(C9) allows one to express the hole densities in terms of the particle densities and vice versa, but in contrast to the non-interacting
case the relationship is non-trivial. The energy and entropy per site of a macro-state are given by

(C10)

The typical state at a given energy density is then obtained by extremizing the free energy per set f [{ρn,p}] = e[{ρn,p}] −
T s[{ρn,p, ρn,h}] with respect to particle and hole densities under the constraints (C9). This results in the so-called Thermody-
namic Bethe Ansatz equations220. By construction this state is thermal, i.e. corresponds to a standard Gibbs distribution.
Atypical ﬁnite entropy states can be constructed by specifying a set of particle densities {ρn,p(λ)}. The corresponding hole
densities are then obtained by solving equations (C9). The entropy per site of the resulting macro-state can be calculated from
(C10), and will by construction be smaller than that of the maximum entropy state.
