Abstract

We study the number of linear extensions of a partial order with a
given proportion of comparable pairs of elements, and estimate the
maximum and minimum possible numbers. We also show that a ran-
dom interval partial order on n elements has close to a third of the pairs
comparable with high probability, and the number of linear extensions
is n! 2−Θ(n) with high probability.

Keywords: Partial orders, linear extensions, comparable pairs, con-

centration inequalities.

Introduction

Initially our interest was in the random interval order Pn, where we pick n
intervals independently and uniformly at random in (0, 1) (precise deﬁnitions
and statements are given later). It turns out that with high probability about

a third of the (cid:0)n

2(cid:1) possible pairs are comparable, and the number e(Pn) of

linear extensions is n! 2−Θ(n). But, given the proportion of comparable pairs,
is this a large number of linear extensions? How few or many could there be?
The main part of the paper is devoted to answering such questions.

We investigate how few or many linear extensions a general partially
ordered set Q or Qn of n points may have, when it has a certain proportion
of the possible edges in its comparability graph (we recall basic deﬁnitions
in the next section).
It is well known – see for example the Proposition
at the end of [6] – that the comparability graph determines the number of
linear extensions e(Q), in the sense that posets with isomorphic (undirected)
comparability graphs have the same number of linear extensions.

This number e(Q) is an important invariant of a poset which is related to,
for example, the worst case number c(Q) of pairwise comparisons required
to determine a (hidden) total order when we are initially given a partial
order compatible with it.
It is easy to see by a bisection argument that
c(Q) ≥ log2 e(Q); and there has been much work over the years on how close
to the truth this is, with one well known result being the bound of Fredman
[9] that c(Q) ≤ log2 e(Q) + 2n, see for example [4] for a recent algorithmic
result in this direction and references to earlier literature.
We focus primarily on posets Qn of n points where the comparability

graph is dense, with about δ(cid:0)n
2(cid:1) edges for some constant δ ∈ (0, 1) – we refer
to such a poset as a dense poset – but we are interested also in what happens
when δ = δ(n) tends to 0 or 1 as n → ∞. Given a positive integer n and
0 < δ < 1, we let

and

2(cid:19)(cid:27)
f +(n, δ) = max(cid:26)e(Qn) : comp(Qn) ≥ δ(cid:18)n
2(cid:19)(cid:27) ,
f −(n, δ) = min(cid:26)e(Qn) : comp(Qn) ≤ δ(cid:18)n

where comp(Qn) denotes the number of edges in the comparability graph of
the poset Qn.

We are interested to study the asymptotic values of functions f +(n, δ)
and f −(n, δ). Some steps in the investigation of the precise maximum values
f +(n, δ) were taken in [8], which concentrated on small numbers of edges
rather than the comparatively large values we shall mainly examine. It is
known – see for example in [8] – that a partial order with the maximum
number of linear extensions for a given number of vertices and comparable
pairs is a semiorder. Previous study of the minimum values f −(n, δ) does
not appear to have been systematic.

The main results of our paper are outlined in Theorem 1.1 below. The
main thrust is that, for each ﬁxed 0 < δ < 1, we have f +(n, δ) = n! 2−Θ(n)
and f −(n, δ) = 2Θ(n). We spell this out more fully.

2

Theorem 1.1. The maximum values f +(n, δ) and minimum values f −(n, δ)
satisfy the following, as n → ∞.
(a) For each 0 < δ < 1 there are constants c1(δ) and c2(δ) such that
n! (cid:19)1/n

0 < c1(δ) <(cid:18)f +(n, δ)
and further, c1(δ) → 1 as δ → 0, and c2(δ) → 0 as δ → 1.

for n suﬃciently large;

< c2(δ) < 1

(b) For each 0 < δ < 1 there are constants c3(δ) and c4(δ) such that

1 < c3(δ) < f −(n, δ)1/n < c4(δ) < ∞ for n suﬃciently large;

and further, c3(δ) → ∞ as δ → 0, and c4(δ) → 1 as δ → 1.

The plan of the paper is as follows. After some preliminaries in the next
section, in Section 3 we study the chain and antichain examples of partial
orders, and derive bounds on the numbers of their linear extensions and
In Section 4 we consider the maximum values f +(n, δ)
comparable pairs.
and prove part (a) of Theorem 1.1, giving further details; for example we
see in Proposition 4.4 that if δ = δ(n) → 1 but not too quickly then
(f +(n, δ)/n!)1/n = Θ(1−δ). In Section 5 we similarly consider the minimum
values f −(n, δ) and prove part (b) of Theorem 1.1; and we see in Proposi-
tion 5.4 that if δ → 0 but not too quickly then f −(n, δ)1/n = Θ(δ−1). Then
in Section 6 we investigate the random interval order Pn (getting the histor-
ical sequence of events out of order): we show that whp comp(Pn) is about
1

3(cid:0)n
2(cid:1) and e(Pn) is n! 2−Ω(n), and thus whp e(Pn) = n! 2−Θ(n) by part (a) of

Theorem 1.1. Finally we make a few concluding remarks in Section 7.

2 Preliminaries

A poset (partially ordered set) P is a set of points equipped with a reﬂexive,
antisymmetric transitive relation ≺, see e.g. [3], [16]. All posets in this paper
are ﬁnite. Typical notations for a poset will be P or Qn, where n indicates
the number of points. A linear extension of a poset is a total order < on the
ground set of points such that whenever x ≺ y in the partial order, then we
have x < y in the total order too. The number of linear extensions of a poset
P is denoted by e(P ).

We say that two points x 6= y are comparable in a poset if x ≺ y or
y ≺ x; otherwise they are incomparable. The comparability graph G is the
undirected graph with vertex set the set of points and an edge between x
and y if and only if they are comparable: the incomparability graph is the
complement G of the comparability graph G.

3

Recall that the comparability graph of P determines e(P ). If the compa-
rability graph of P is a strict subgraph of that of Q, then clearly e(P ) > e(Q)
– see e.g. [15]. However, the naïve intuition that the more edges in the com-
parability graph the fewer linear extensions is inaccurate: for example the
six-vertex poset consisting of two three-element chains with no comparabili-

ties between them has 6 edges in the comparability graph and(cid:0)6

extensions (as we shall see), but the six-element poset comprising of one max-
imum element, one minimum element and an antichain of four elements all
between the maximum and minimum element has 9 edges in the comparabil-
ity graph and 4! = 24 linear extensions. We thus word our results in terms
of posets which have at most, or at least, a certain proportion of edges in the
comparability graph to mitigate these lack of monotonicity issues.

3(cid:1) = 20 linear

A chain in P is a set T of points, any two of which are comparable: such
a set T can be totally ordered, i.e. enumerated as T = {t1, t2, . . . , tr} with
t1 ≺ t2 ≺ . . . ≺ tr. The maximum number of points in a chain is called the
height of P and is denoted by h(P ). By contrast, an antichain in P is a set
of points, no two of which are comparable. The maximum number of points
in an antichain is called the width of P and is denoted by w(P ).

We shall sometimes use the level structure of the poset P on a set V
of points. The ﬁrst level L1 consists of all minimal elements, that is, those
points x ∈ V for which y (cid:22) x ⇒ y = x. The second level consists of the
minimal elements of the induced subposet on V \L1 and generally the ith level
Li consists of the minimal elements of the induced subposet on V \ ∪i−1
j=1Lj.
Note that the number of non-empty levels is h(P ) ≤ |V | and that each level
is an antichain.
For positive functions f (n) and g(n) we as usual write f (n) = O(g(n))
if there is a constant K such that f (n) ≤ K · g(n) for all large enough n,
and similarly f (n) = Ω(g(n)) if f (n) ≥ K · g(n) for all large enough n. If
f (n) = O(g(n)) and f (n) = Ω(g(n)), then we write f (n) = Θ(g(n)). We
f (n)
also use the standard notations f (n) = o(g(n)) if limn→∞
g(n) = 0, and
f (n) ∼ g(n) if f (n) = (1 + o(1))g(n) as n → ∞. It is a little less standard
to use the notation f (n) = ω(g(n)) when g(n) = o(f (n)), that is, when
limn→∞

f (n)

g(n) = ∞.

When we talk later about properties of a random poset Qn with n points,
we shall say that Qn has a given property P with high probability (whp) if
P(Qn has P) → 1 as n → ∞. We use Stirling’s formula n! ∼ √2πn(n/e)n,
and make repeated use of the related inequality n! ≥ (n/e)n which follows
from the series expansion of en. Also, we write [n] to denote the set of positive
integers {1, . . . , n}.

4

3 The chain and antichain examples

We introduce two standard examples of partial orders where we can write
down the number of linear extensions. The chain example C = C(n1, . . . , nk)
is the poset consisting of disjoint chains of sizes n1, . . . , nk with no compara-
bilities between the chains. We have

e(C) =(cid:18)

n

n1, . . . , nk(cid:19) ≤ kn.

(1)

To see the ﬁrst inequality, when for example k = 2, observe that the only
choices to make are which positions in the total order are occupied by the n1
points from the ﬁrst chain. It follows that for any poset Qn with width at
most k we have

e(Qn) ≤ kn,

(2)
since by Dilworth’s Theorem [5] a poset Qn with w(Qn) ≤ k can be parti-
tioned into at most k chains.
The antichain example is the poset A = A(n1, . . . , nk) consisting of dis-
joint antichains A1, . . . , Ak of sizes n1, . . . , nk such that if x ∈ Ai, y ∈ Aj
and i < j then x ≺ y. Observe that the comparability graphs for the posets
A and C are complementary (with the natural choice of sets of points). We
have

e(A) =

k

Yi=1

ni! = n!/(cid:18)

n

n1, . . . , nk(cid:19) ≥ n!/kn.

(3)

It follows by considering the level structure that for any poset Qn with height
at most k we have

e(Qn) ≥ n!/kn.

(4)

Recall that by the Kleitman-Rothschild Theorem [12], almost all uni-
formly at random selected posets Qn on [n] have height 3, therefore e(Qn) ≥
n! 3−n for almost all such posets.
We shall be most interested in the special cases when the ni are as bal-
anced as possible. The balanced chain example C(n, k) is deﬁned, for all
integers 1 ≤ k ≤ n, as C(n1, . . . , nk) where ⌊n/k⌋ ≤ n1 ≤ · · · ≤ nk ≤ ⌈n/k⌉,
and the ni sum to n. Then e(C(n, k)) ≤ kn by (1) or (2). Also, for each
given point there are at most ⌈n/k⌉ − 1 ≤ n−1

These examples furnish all the lower bounds needed for f +(n, δ).

Upper bounds

We ﬁrst use a martingale concentration inequality to prove the upper
bound e(Qn) ≤ n! 2−Ω(n) on the number of linear extensions of a dense poset.
Lemma 4.1. There is an absolute positive constant c, which can be taken to
be log2 e
32 ≈ 0.045, such that the following holds. Let 0 < δ ≤ 1, and let Qn be

2(cid:1). Then
e(Qn) ≤ n! 2−cδ2n.

a poset on n points with comp(Qn) ≥ δ(cid:0)n
Proof. Let Sn be the set of all n! permutations of [n]. For τ ∈ Sn let g(τ ) be
the number of conﬂicts of τ with the poset Qn: that is, the number of ordered
pairs (i, j), such that i < j in τ and j ≺ i in the partial order. Obviously, τ
is a linear extension of Qn if and only if g(τ ) = 0. If τ and τ ′ diﬀer by one
transposition σ, i.e. τ = τ ′ ◦ σ in the symmetric group (σ acting ﬁrst say),
then if σ interchanges x and y, it changes the number of conﬂicts by at most
n − 1 for each of x and y, so

|g(τ ′) − g(τ )| ≤ 2(n − 1).

(11)

7

When τ is chosen uniformly at random from Sn, we have that E(g(τ )) =
comp(Qn)/2 since for each x 6= y, P(x < y) = P(y < x) = 1
2 (where < refers
to the ordering τ ). Put s = comp(Qn)/2 ≥ δn(n − 1)/4. We may now use
Theorem 7.4 of [14], together with the inequality (11), to obtain

P(g(τ ) = 0) = P(g(τ ) − s ≤ −s)

≤ exp(cid:18) −2s2

4n(n − 1)2(cid:19) ≤ e−δ2n/32.

Hence

which completes the proof.

e(Qn) = n! P(g(τ ) = 0) ≤ n! e−δ2n/32

The last Lemma covered all ﬁxed δ with 0 < δ ≤ 1, but even when δ = 1
we just ﬁnd e(Qn) ≤ n! 2−cn. We need another result to show that when
δ → 1 we have f +(n, δ) = n! 2−ω(n). This follows from Lemma 4.3 below
(which says nothing asymptotically if δ < 1 − 2/e). In fact we shall see that
if δ → 1, but not too quickly, then (f +(n, δ)/n!)1/n = Θ(1−δ). First, here is
a preliminary Lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let Q be a partial order on a set S of at least two elements,
and let v ∈ S. Suppose that S ′ = S \ {v} is a chain, and v is incomparable
to exactly x points in S ′. Then e(Q) = x + 1.

Proof. List S ′ as u1 ≺ u2 ≺ · · · ≺ uk where k = |S ′|. If x = 0 then Q is
a linear order so e(Q) = 1 = x + 1: so assume that x ≥ 1. The x points
incomparable to v are ua, . . . , ub for some a ≤ b with b−a = x−1. The linear
extensions of Q are then formed by inserting v in one of the slots between ui
and ui+1 for some i ∈ {a, . . . , b − 1}, or inserting v immediately before ua or
immediately after ub: thus e(Q) = x + 1, as required.

Proof. Let G be the complement of the comparability graph G of the poset
Qn and let E(G) be the set of edges of G. Consider the vertices in the order
1, 2, . . . , n and let xv be the ‘back-degree’ of vertex v in G (that is, the number
of edges uv in G with u < v). Then, by considering building up the linear
extension step-by-step and using Lemma 4.2, we may see that

Suppose that δ = δ(n) → 1 as n → ∞. Let g(n) → ∞ with g(n) = O(n);
and let η = max{1− δ, 1/g(n)}, so that η → 0 (but not too quickly). By the

Putting this result together with the example above for δ → 1 gives

(f +(n, δ)/n!)1/n = Θ(1−δ).

5 Minimum numbers of extensions: f−(n, δ)

Upper bounds

2(cid:1) and e(Qn) ≤ kn. Thus
f −(n, δ)1/n ≤ 2δ−1.

Consider ﬁrst a ﬁxed δ with 0 < δ ≤ 1. Set k = ⌈δ−1⌉, so δ−1 ≤ k <
2δ−1 and let Qn be the balanced chain example C(n, k). We then have that
k(cid:0)n
2(cid:1) ≤ δ(cid:0)n
comp(Qn) ≤ 1

(13)
Now suppose δ = δ(n) → 1. We wish to show that f −(n, δ)1/n → 1. Let
η = max{1 − δ, n−2}, so η → 0. Let t = ⌈ηn⌉, let τ = t/n, and note that
η ≤ τ ≤ η + 1/n. Consider Qn to be C(t, n − t). By (8) comp(Qn) ≤

Lower bounds

Our ﬁrst Lemma covers the whole range 0 < δ < 1, and in particular

when δ is near to 1.

Lemma 5.1. Let 0 < δ < 1 and let Qn be any poset on n vertices with

comp(Qn) ≤ δ(cid:0)n

2(cid:1). We then have

e(Qn) ≥ 2

1

2 (1−δ)n.

2(cid:1) ≥ 1

Proof. Since δ < 1 we have e(Qn) ≥ 2. Thus we may assume that (1−δ)n > 2.
Since there are at most δ(cid:0)n
2(cid:1) comparable pairs, the height h := h(Qn) of the
poset is less than (1 + δ)n/2. For if h ≥ (1 + δ)n/2, then the number of
comparable pairs would be at least (cid:0)h
8(1 + δ)n((1 + δ)n − 2). But then
(1 + δ)n((1 + δ)n − 2) ≤ 4δn(n − 1), so (1 − δ)n ≤ 2 which contradicts
(1 − δ)n > 2.
But e(Qn) ≥ 2n−h. One way to see this is to consider starting with a
chain of h elements, and add elements one at a time to obtain Qn: each time
we add an element the number of linear extensions increases by at least a
factor 2. Hence e(Qn) ≥ 2n− 1
We may see quickly that f −(n, δ)1/n → ∞ when δ → 0. Observe that
if comp(Qn) ≤ δ(cid:0)n
2 n + 1: for

2(cid:1) then the height h = h(Qn) satisﬁes h < δ
comp(Qn) ≥(cid:18)h

This gives the lower bounds required on f −(n, δ) in Theorem 1.1, but we can
obtain better lower bounds for the case δ → 0, in terms of the dependence
on δ. In the bound in Lemma 5.3 below we essentially replace δ− 1
2 by δ−1.
We ﬁrst recall a preparatory Lemma. A proof of this can be found in for
example [1] Theorem 6.3 – the result is also stated as exercise 57 to Chapter
3 of [16] and the equality part to exercise 20 in [13, subsection 5.1.4].

δ < 0.652. More importantly, putting Lemma 5.3 together with (13) gives:

Proposition 5.4. If δ = o(1) with δ = Ω(1/n), then f −(n, δ)1/n = Θ(δ−1).

6 Random interval partial orders

Here we examine random interval posets, see [7]. Given a family of n closed
intervals Ij = [aj, bj] in the real line for j = 1, . . . , n, we form an interval
partial order on [n] by setting i ≺ j if and only if bi < aj. Thus two
elements of the poset are comparable when their corresponding intervals do
not intersect, and otherwise they are incomparable. A chain of the poset
is a set of pairwise non-intersecting intervals; and an antichain is a set of
pairwise intersecting intervals (that is, by Helly’s Theorem, a set of intervals
containing a common point).

Suppose that we start with 2n independent random variables X1, . . . , Xn
and Y1, . . . , Yn, each from the uniform distribution on [0, 1]; and form n closed
intervals Ij, for j = 1, . . . , n, where Ij = [Xj, Yj] if Xj < Yj and [Yj, Xj]
otherwise. (The event that Xj = Yj has probability zero so can be ignored.)
These intervals Ij yield a random interval poset Pn. It would not matter if
we replaced the uniform distribution on [0, 1] by any continuous distribution.
Also equivalently, we could generate the intervals from a uniform random
perfect matching on {1, . . . , 2n}.
It is easy to see the the probability that two random intervals are com-
parable is 1/3 – see e.g. [10]. Indeed, for i 6= j, the probability that the four
end points of the intervals Ii and Ij come in any given order is 1/4! = 1/24;
and there are exactly 8 orders such that the intervals are disjoint. It follows
that the number Z of edges in the comparability graph satisﬁes E[Z] = 1

3(cid:0)n
2(cid:1).
Also, given any values x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn, changing the values of xk and
yk can aﬀect only the edges incident to node k in the comparability graph,
so the number of edges can vary by at most n − 1. Hence by the bounded
diﬀerences inequality (Lemma 1.2 of [14], or see for example Theorem 6.3
of [2]), for each t > 0,

P(|Z − E[Z]| ≥ t) ≤ 2 exp(cid:18)−

2t2

n(n − 1)2(cid:19) .

Thus, for 0 < a < 1

P(|Z −

2(cid:19)| ≥ a(cid:18)n
3(cid:18)n

2(cid:19)) ≤ 2 exp(cid:0)−

a2n(cid:1)

and we see that a random interval order is dense whp.

Again, we want to estimate how many linear extensions Pn has. Let An
denote the size of a largest set of intersecting intervals in our family of n
random intervals – in the poset language, this is a maximum antichain. It
was shown in [10] that whp An = n
2 + o(n). But e(Pn) ≥ An! so by Stirling’s
formula, we have that whp

log2 e(Pn) ≥ log2(

n
2

+ o(n))! = (

1
2

+ o(1))n log2 n.

This bound is enough to show that the 2n term in the Fredman bound
log2 e(Pn) + 2n is small compared with the main term log2 e(Pn). We shall
reﬁne the idea above to show that a random interval partial order has many
more linear extensions.

Theorem 6.1. The number e(Pn) of linear extensions of a random interval
partial order Pn satisﬁes

e(Pn) = n! 2−Θ(n) whp.

Proof. By Lemma 4.1 it will suﬃce for us to show that e(Pn) ≥ n! 2−O(n) whp;
and in fact we shall show that

e(Pn) ≥ n! 2−(6+o(1))n whp.

(14)

i

2j , i+1

For positive integers i and j with i odd and i < 2j, let I(i, j) denote the
interval ( i−1
2j ). Thus for each j ≥ 1 there are 2j−1 intervals I(i, j); and
these intervals partition [0, 1], except that they omit the 2j−1 + 1 end points
2j−1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2j−1.
Let 0 < a < b < 1 and consider the interval (a, b). Let j(a, b) be the least
integer j ≥ 1 such that i
2j ∈ (a, b) for some positive integer i. There is a
unique such i: for if there were at least two such i, then there would be at
least one even i, and we could replace i/2j by (i/2)/2j−1, giving a smaller
value of j and contradicting the deﬁnition of j. Since i is unique, we may
call it i(a, b).

We denote the interval I(cid:0)i(a, b), j(a, b)(cid:1) by J(a, b). For positive integers
i and j with i odd and i < 2j, let A(i, j) be the random set of all intervals
(a, b) amongst I1, . . . , In such that J(a, b) = I(i, j). Each interval (a, b) in
A(i, j) contains the point i/2j, so the sets A(i, j) are antichains. It follows
i/2j) is less than the midpoint of
also that, if the midpoint of I(i, j) (i.e.
I(i′, j ′) (i.e. i′/2j ′) then no interval in A(i′, j ′) can precede any interval in
A(i, j) in the interval partial order.

Let N(i, j) = |A(i, j)|, so Pi,j N(i, j) = n. Then from the above

e(Pn) ≥Yi,j
log2 e(Pn) ≥Xi,j

(N(i, j)/e)N (i,j)

N(i, j)! ≥Yi,j
N(i, j) log2 N(i, j) − n log2 e.

Here we sum only over i, j such that N(i, j) 6= 0. Fix j, and let Nj =
Pi N(i, j). Then, since we sum over at most 2j−1 values of i, by convexity
of x log2 x

N(i, j) log2 N(i, j) ≥ Nj log2(Nj/2j−1).

and so

Hence

log2 e(Pn) ≥Xj

Nj log2(Nj/2j−1) − n log2 e.

(15)

Let the random variable Jk be j(a, b) for the kth random interval. Then
P(Jk = j) = 2−j for each j = 1, 2, . . .. To see this, condition on the value x
of the ﬁrst end point of the interval (which could be the left or the right end
point). If x ∈ ( i−1
2j , i
2j ) for some odd i, then Jk = j if and only if the second
end point falls in ( i
2j , i+1
2j ), which has probability 2−j. On the other hand, if
x ∈ ( i
2j , i+1
2j ) for some odd i, then Jk = j if and only if the second end point
falls in ( i−1
2j , i

2j ), which also has probability 2−j.

By the deﬁnition of Nj, it is the number of intervals Ik such that Jk = j.
Then Nj has the binomial distribution with parameters n and 2−j, which
has mean E(Nj) = n2−j and variance n2−j(1 − 2−j) ≤ n2−j. Hence, by
Chebyshev’s inequality,

P(|Nj − n2−j| ≥ n2−j−1) ≤

(n2−j−1)2 =

Let j0 := j0(n) = log2 n − h(n), where h(n) → ∞ slowly as n → ∞: we set
h(n) ∼ log2 log2 n. Then, by the union bound,

Also,

Let Bn be the event that |Nj − n2−j| ≤ n2−j−1 for each j = 1, . . . , j0 and

j=1 Nj ≥ n − h(n)2h(n). By the above P(Bn) = 1 − o(1). Condition on Bn.
Then by (15)

We have now shown that the event Bn happens whp, and when it happens
we have e(Pn) ≥ n! 2−(6+o(1))n. Hence (14) holds, and we are done.

7 Concluding remarks

We have proved Theorem 1.1, concerning maximum and minimum possible
numbers of linear extensions, and in the process we have given more de-
tailed information. In particular, we saw that if δ → 1 but not too quickly

15

then (f +(n, δ)/n!)1/n = Θ(1− δ); and if δ → 0 but not too quickly then
f −(n, δ)1/n = Θ(δ−1). What can we say about other rates of convergence?
Can we say more about the constants ci(δ)?

We have also shown in Theorem 6.1 that a random interval partial order
Pn whp has e(Pn) = n! 2−Θ(n). Can this be pinned down more precisely? Is
there a constant c > 0 such that whp (e(Pn)/n!)1/n → c as n → ∞? (If there
is such a constant c, then c ≥ 2−6 by the inequality (14).)
A natural way to try to prove results like those presented here is to use
bounds on the number of linear extensions based on entropy, see [11], [4].
Sometimes this approach can match the bounds we have obtained and some-
times not, but it does not seem to lead to improvements.
