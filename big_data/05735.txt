Traction relations for active colloids and their application

Passive colloidal particles produce ﬂow only when they are in motion in the ambient ﬂuid. In
contrast, active colloidal particles produce ﬂow even when stationary in the ﬂuid. This active ﬂow
mediates non-local many-body hydrodynamic interactions between active colloids through tractions
at the colloid-ﬂuid boundary. Here, we use the boundary integral representation of slow viscous
ﬂow to obtain an integral equation that linearly relates tractions to active boundary conditions
in a suspension of N spherical active colloids. The integral equation is discretized in a basis of
tensorial spherical harmonics and solved to yield linear relations, expressed by a generalized friction
matrix, between the tensorial harmonic coeﬃcients of the traction and the active boundary velocity.
Hydrodynamic forces and torques between active colloids follow from the ﬁrst two rows of the
friction matrix. Their leading order forms are applied to study the overdamped dynamics of active
colloids in an optical lattice. The symmetric ﬁrst moment of the traction follows from the third row
of the friction matrix and is used to obtain an exact expression for the Landau-Lifshitz-Batchelor
suspension stress and to conﬁrm that this vanishes to ﬁrst order in volume fraction in an isotropic
suspension. The remaining rows contain higher moments of the traction necessary to determine the
energy dissipation and the ﬂuid ﬂow. The traction relations derived here provide the basis for a
microscopic theory of active suspensions that consistently accounts for momentum conservation in
the bulk ﬂuid and at ﬂuid-solid boundaries.

INTRODUCTION

Particles in ordinary colloidal suspensions produce
ﬂuid ﬂow only when in a state of translational or ro-
tational motion. The ﬂuid ﬂow mediates hydrodynamic
interactions between the particles, the study of which
has a long and distinguished history yet continues to
hold current interest [1]. Recently, a new class of col-
loidal particles have been synthesized that produce ﬂow
in the ambient ﬂuid even in the absence of translational
or rotational motion [2]. The ﬂow-producing mechanism
involves, typically, osmotic stresses set up by catalytic re-
actions at the colloidal surface [3]. Autonomously motile
microorganisms also ﬁnd a natural place in this category
[4].

The surge of interest, both experimental and theoreti-
cal, in active colloidal suspensions derives from their re-
markable properties. First, steady motion in active col-
loidal particles is possible in the absence of external forces
or torques. In contrast, Brownian motion is the only pos-
sibility in a force-free torque-free suspension of passive
particles. Second, the hydrodynamic forces and torques
are generally orientation-dependent, even for particles
that are geometrically spherical. In contrast, forces and
torques depend only on relative positions in a passive
suspension of spheres. Finally, active suspensions remain
out of equilibrium due to the sustained production of en-
tropy in the active ﬂow. In contrast, passive suspensions
are typically in thermodynamic equilibrium with a con-
stant value of the entropy.

The principal dynamical quantity in any theoretical
model of active suspensions is the force per unit area, or

∗ rsingh@imsc.res.in
† rjoy@imsc.res.in

the traction, on the surface of the colloidal particle. The
traction determines the hydrodynamic force and torque
and, thereby, provides the force laws needed in a New-
tonian description of the suspension. Additionally, the
traction determines the macroscopic stress in the suspen-
sion, as was ﬁrst pointed out by Landau and Lifshitz [5],
and later elaborated by Batchelor [6] and others [7]. The
traction is necessary, therefore, to determine the rheology
of an active suspension. Finally, the work done on the
ﬂuid by the particles is determined by the integral of the
product of the traction and ﬂuid velocity on the surface
of the particle. In slow viscous ﬂow, the work done on the
ﬂuid is entirely dissipated and the traction, therefore, is
essential for a quantitative estimate of energy dissipation
[5].

Motivated by the central role of the traction in suspen-
sion mechanics we develop, here, a method to compute
the traction in a suspension of N spherical active col-
loidal particles. The inputs to the method are the parti-
cle positions, orientations, and their active slip velocities.
The output is the traction, as a function of the above
inputs. The force laws, rheology, and the power dissi-
pation in an active suspension follow directly from the
traction relations. Our method applies to suspensions in
an unbounded ﬂuid, in a ﬂuid bounded by a plane wall,
in the computationally useful cubic periodic ﬂow, and
more generally, in any geometry for which the Green’s
function of slow viscous ﬂow is available. Our method
enforces momentum conservation exactly and provides
an accurate and eﬃcient method for computing many-
body hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions.
An attractive feature of the method is that ﬂuid degrees
of freedom are eliminated in favour of non-local interac-
tions between particles. This leads to a much reduced ex-
pense, compared to methods that resolve the ﬂuid, when
the method is employed for numerical simulation. Our

method can be extended, with small changes, to ellip-
soidal active colloids where geometric anisotropy com-
bines with anisotropic active ﬂow in determining suspen-
sion properties.

Our method of computing the traction exploits the lin-
earity of slow viscous ﬂow. This is most clearly mani-
fested in the boundary integral representation that pro-
vides the bulk ﬂow as an integral, over the boundaries of
the ﬂow, of the tractions and the velocity boundary con-
ditions. Matching the bulk ﬂow with the velocity at the
boundaries yields a linear integral equation, speciﬁcally
a Fredholm integral equation of the ﬁrst kind, for the
tractions at the boundaries. The traction, therefore, is
given as a linear functional of the velocity boundary con-
ditions. The linear integral equation is transformed into
an inﬁnite dimensional system of linear algebraic equa-
tions by expanding the tractions and the velocity bound-
ary conditions in a complete, orthogonal basis. Iterative
or direct solvers are then used to obtain the traction,
either analytically or numerically, as a function of the
velocity boundary conditions. The solution is expressed
formally through inﬁnite-dimensional friction matrices
relating the coeﬃcients of the traction expansion to those
of the velocity boundary conditions. The key quantities
in suspension mechanics - the forces and torques, the
suspension stress and the power dissipation - follow im-
mediately from the traction. Numerical integration of
the (generally overdamped) Newtonian equations of mo-
tion, completed by forces and torques derived from the
traction, yields trajectories from which dynamical and
statistical information can be extracted.

Our method is a synthesis of techniques drawn from
classic studies of passive colloidal suspensions. The
boundary integral representation was ﬁrst used by Youn-
gren and Acrivos for calculating the traction on an arbi-
trarily shaped particle [8]. Basis expansions of the trac-
tion originate in the work of Zick and Homsy [9] and
Mazur and van Saarloos [10] and are developed further
by Ladd in his study of periodic suspensions [11]. Linear
relations between the traction and velocity coeﬃcients
are obtained by the above authors and by Schmitz and
Felderhof [12]. An iterative solution for the force on a
colloidal particle was ﬁrst given by Smoluchowski in his
‘method of reﬂections’. Its equivalence to Jabobi’s iter-
ative method was recognized by Ichiki and Brady [13].
Dynamical simulations on the Stokesian time-scale using
force laws obtained from the solution of a linear system
was introduced by Brady and coworkers [14].

It is important to emphasize that in all of the above
studies, the velocity boundary condition is always of the
form V+Ω×r, corresponding to the rigid-body motion of
a passive colloidal particle with linear velocity Vand an-
gular velocity Ω. In contrast, here we consider the most
general form of the boundary condition, for which, in
addition to the linear and angular velocities, an inﬁnite
number of algebraic quantities are, in principle, required.
Our earlier contribution on computing many-body hydro-
dynamic interactions in active colloidal suspensions fo-

2

cussed on the mobility formulation, where the rigid body
motion is obtained in terms of the given body forces,
body torques and active velocities [15]. The contribution
in this paper considers the complementary resistance for-
mulation, where tractions are obtained in terms of veloc-
ities. The mobility formulation is convenient for direct
numerical simulations while the resistance formulation is
convenient for constructing dynamical equations in terms
of forces and torques. Earlier work closest in spirit to
ours is that of Ishikawa et al [16, 17] where axisymmet-
ric slip velocities, truncated to the ﬁrst two non-trivial
modes, are considered. The far-ﬁeld and near-ﬁeld hydro-
dynamic interactions are obtained, respectively, in super-
position and lubrication approximations. In contrast, we
include the most general slip and do not make an artiﬁcial
separation between near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld contributions,
which is known to produce upto 30% errors [11].

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section I we introduce the boundary integral represen-
tation of slow viscous ﬂuid.The integral equation for the
traction that follows is reduced to an inﬁnite dimensional
linear algebraic system using a Galerkin discretization
procedure in which the boundary traction and velocity
are expanded in a complete orthogonal basis of tensorial
spherical harmonics and the boundary conditions are en-
forced in an integral sense. The solution is given in terms
of a generalized friction matrix that relates the traction
coeﬃcients of the expansion to the velocity coeﬃcients.
The force, torque, suspension stress, ﬂuid ﬂow and power
dissipation are obtained exactly in terms of elements of
the friction matrix.
In Section II we outline an itera-
tive procedure for solving the inﬁnite dimensional linear
system using Jacobi’s method. Since the coeﬃcients of
the linear system are simply related to the Green’s func-
tion and its derivatives, the method is applicable to any
geometry where the Green’s function is known. In partic-
ular, half-spaces and periodic volumes are easily handled
by the method.
In Section III, we derive the traction
relations in an unbounded domain for minimally active
colloidal spheres. In Section IV we use the traction rela-
tions to study the dynamics of minimally active colloids
in optical lattices. We ﬁnd that there is an instability
in the system if the traps centers are not collinear while
in a non-collinear arrangement of trap centers there is
synchronized dynamics about an axis of symmetry.
In
Section V we express the Landau-Lifshitz-Batchelor sus-
pension stress in terms of friction matrices. This provides
the suspension stress as function of the position and ori-
entation of all particles. We conﬁrm that the active con-
tribution to the suspension stress vanishes to linear order
in volume fraction in an isotropic suspension. We con-
clude by pointing out directions for further study.

I. DERIVATION OF TRACTION RELATIONS

We consider N active colloidal spheres of radius a in
an incompressible ﬂuid. The position of the center of the

3
where v is the ﬂuid velocity, σ = −pI + η(∇v +∇vT ) is
the Cauchy stress, p is pressure and η is the viscosity [18,
19]. This is to be solved with the boundary conditions

v(Rn + ρn) = Vn + Ωn × ρn + va
where va
n is the active slip. The solution provides the
ﬂuid velocity and the Cauchy stress, and thereby the
traction on the sphere surface. This closes Eq. (2) and
provides, implicitly, the velocity and angular velocity of
the spheres.

Remarkably, it is possible to obtain the traction di-
rectly by solving a two-dimensional
integral equation
rather than the three-dimensional partial diﬀerential
equation that the Stokes system of Eq. (3) represents.
The integral representation of the Stokes system pro-
vides the three-dimensional ﬂuid ﬂow as a sum of two-
dimensional integrals of the traction and velocity ﬁelds
over the surface of the spheres [20–23]

Kijk(r, r(cid:48)) = −δikpj + ∇kGij + ∇iGjk.

The integral containing G is the single-layer integral
while the integral containing K is the double-layer in-
tegral. The terminology is derived from potential theory
in electrostatics with which there is a close analogy [15].
Evaluating Eq. (5) on the surface of the n-th sphere,
n = 1 . . . N , and equating to the boundary condition Eq.
(4) results in a Fredholm integral equation system of the
ﬁrst kind for the unknown tractions. The integral equa-
tion most clearly shows that the traction is linearly re-
lated to the boundary velocity. Therefore, the traction
has a contribution that is proportional to the rigid body
motion and another that is proportional to the active
slip. The rigid body contribution has been studied by
many authors [7]. The active slip contribution is studied
here for the ﬁrst time. A survey of previous applications
of the boundary integral method for passive suspensions
and a comparison with our application to active suspen-
sions has been presented in our previous work [15].

We solve the Fredholm integral equation in a basis of
complete orthogonal functions on the sphere [9, 15]. A

n-th sphere is Rn and its orientation is speciﬁed by the

locity of the colloidal sphere about its center are Vn and
Ωn respectively. The ambient ﬂuid can exchange both
momentum and angular momentum with the spheres at
their boundaries. The spheres may also be acted upon
by body forces and torques, over and above the contact
forces that arise from the ﬂuid. The motion of the spheres

These overdamped dynamical equations are complete

spheres.

The motion of the ﬂuid is governed by the Stokes sys-
tem, embodying the statements of incompressibility and

These expansion coeﬃcients are tensors of rank l, sym-

and its physical content is simple: the l-th mode of the
traction on the n−th sphere is related linearly to every
mode of the boundary velocity on every sphere. The
γ(l, l(cid:48))
nm are elements of a generalised friction matrix that
encodes the hydrodynamic interaction mediated through
the ﬂuid. The friction matrix depends on the positions
of all spheres, reﬂecting the many-body nature of the
hydrodynamic interaction.

It is convenient now to recognize that the velocity and
traction coeﬃcients, being tensors of rank l irreducible
in their last l − 1 indices, can be expressed as the sum of
three irreducible tensors of rank l, l−1 and l−2. This fact
has been noted independently in several previous studies
[15, 25, 26]. The three irreducible parts are

F(ls) = F(l); F(la) =  : F(l); F(lt) = δ : F(l), (15a)

V(ls) = V(l); V(la) =  : V(l); V(lt) = δ : V(l), (15b)

where s, a, t correspond to symmetric, antisymmetric and
trace. The operator (. . . ) = ∆(l)(. . . ) extracts the sym-
metric irreducible part of the tensor it acts on.

Using this irreducible decomposition the formal solu-
tion of the linear system, Eq. (14), can be expressed in
terms of the irreducible parts of the force and traction
coeﬃcients as

We call this inﬁnite set of linear equations the traction
relations. Given the velocity at the boundary of each
sphere, they completely determine the traction on every
sphere. This is the central result of the paper.

nm , γRT

The ﬁrst two rows of generalised friction matrix, cor-
responding to lσ = 1s and lσ = 2a are of special signif-
icance as they yield the force and the torque. Previous
work only considered rigid body motion and thus the
velocity expansion contained only two terms correspond-
ing to translation and rotation. This leads to the usual
generalized Stokes drag, encoded in the friction tensors
nm = γ(1s, 1s)
γT T
nm =
γ(2a, 2a)
[18, 27] . Here, in contrast, there are, in prin-
ciple, an inﬁnite number of velocity coeﬃcients. These
produce additional forces and torques and represent the
active contribution to the hydrodynamic interaction. We
introduce the slip friction matrices γ(T, lσ)

familiar from the theory of passive colloids [10, 11, 28–

late the rigid body motion to the modes of the active
velocity. In this mobility formulation it is most clearly
seen that colloidal motion can occur in the absence of
external forces and torques, and even in the absence of
self-propulsion or self-rotation. The mobility and slip
mobility formalism above is more convenient for simula-
tions while the friction and slip friction formulation gives
terms that directly enter Newton’s equations. It should
be noted that both formalisms are mathematically and
physically equivalent. The relationship between mobility
and friction tensors is well-known [23, 27, 34, 35]. The
relation between the slip mobility matrices, ﬁrst intro-
duced in [15] and slip friction matrices introduced here,

Several important conclusions follow directly from the
above. First, active colloids interact hydrodynamically
even when their velocity and angular velocity are zero.
This situation is impossible in passive colloids where the
hydrodynamic interaction sets in only when colloidal par-
ticles are in motion. Second, active forces and torques
can be generated even without self-propulsion, Va
n = 0
or self-rotation, Ωa
m = 0. Any lσ mode of the active slip
may generate a force or a torque, though, their spatial
range decreases with increasing l. Finally, though these
forces and torques appear in Newton’s equations, they
are, emphatically, not body forces and torques. They are
the sum of the contact forces that act at the ﬂuid-solid
boundary. This fact is evident in the physical dimension
of the generalized friction matrix where every matrix el-
ement has dimension equal to ηa.

Using the above expressions for the contact forces and
torques in Newton’s equations, Eq. (2), it is possible to
solve for the velocity and angular velocity in terms of the
body forces and torques and the modes of the slip. The
result is

µ(R, lσ)

These relations can be used to transit between formula-
tions.

The preceding discussion has focussed on the ﬁrst two
rows of the generalized friction matrix. The third row,
corresponding to lσ = 2s, as we shall see later, is related
to the suspension stress. The full friction matrix, how-
ever, is needed to determine the state of motion of the
ﬂuid and to calculate the power dissipated in it, as we
now show. The expression for ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of the
tensorial coeﬃcients is

ITERATIVE SOLUTION

In the previous section we showed that the traction
relations represent the solution of the boundary integral
equation for the traction. We postulated the existence of
the generalized friction matrix, implicitly assuming the
invertibility of the single-layer. In this section, we pro-
vide a constructive solution for the generalized friction

matrix, given the matrix elements of the single-layer and
double-layer integrals. The solution employs the classical
Jacobi iteration, which is the mathematical basis of the
physically motivated “method of reﬂections” ﬁrst used by
Smoluchowski. Other methods with better convergence
properties are an avenue for further study.

The generalized friction matrix is the solution to the
linear system in Eq.
(12), which, written in terms of
the irreducible tensorial coeﬃcients and arranged into
standard form, is

diagonal terms m = n, l = l(cid:48) and σ = σ(cid:48). The iter-
ation must begin with an initial guess for the solution.
As the linear system is diagonally dominant, the one-
particle solution is always a good starting guess. We
note that this method requires as input the matrix ele-
ments of the single- and double-layer integrals. Those,
in turn, require only the Green’s function for the ap-
propriate geometry. This makes our method agnostic
to the ﬂow geometry and, in particular, applicable to
unbounded, wall-bounded and periodic geometries. We
provide explicit expressions for the ﬁrst three rows of the
generalised friction matrix, at ﬁrst iteration, in Appendix
C. In the next section we provide explicit expressions for
the forces and torques between minimally active colloidal
spheres in an unbounded geometry. This is followed by
a study of their dynamics in an optical lattice.

7

FIG. 2. Forces and torques depend on particle orientation as friction is both non-local and orientation-dependent. To demon-
strate this, ﬂow ﬁeld due to a particle (green) at origin is plotted. Two tracer particles (white) are added to the plot to show
the direction of force acting on them due to the ﬂuid produced by the particle at the origin. Panel (a) has the ﬂow due to an
external force (lσ = 1s) in the downward direction. This force only depends on the particle position. In panel (b) and (c) ﬂow
due active slip with modes lσ = 2s and lσ = 3t is shown. It can be seen clearly that the ﬂuid ﬂow depends on the particle
position as well as its orientation (shown as a green arrow). The forces change even though there is no change in relative
position between panels (b) and (c).

III. MINIMAL TRUNCATION IN UNBOUNDED

The force and torque on any particle, then, is

FLOW

In the previous section we presented an iterative
method for constructing the generalized friction matrix.
In this section, we obtain explicit results for a minimally
active colloid . This is deﬁned to be a colloid that can
autonomously translate, rotate, and stir the ﬂuid when
stationary [4, 15]. This requires a slip of the form
· ˆρn

va(Rn + ρn) = −Va

n × ρn + V(2s)

n − Ωa

(28)

n

which is a truncation of the general expansion at lσ = 2s.
The one-body solution can be calculated exactly in an
unbounded domain. The generalized friction matrix is
fully diagonal, as we show in Appendix B. The Jacobi
iteration trivially converges in this case and the traction
relations, then, are [4, 15],

Fn = −6πηa (Vn − Va

n) ; Tn = −8πηa3(Ωn − Ωa
n),
(31)
implying that, under force-free, torque-free conditions
colloids translate and rotate independently with linear
and angular velocities determined by Eq. (11); there is
no hydrodynamic interaction. This result was obtained
previously by several authors from a direct solution of
the Stokes equation [3, 37, 38], through the use of the
reciprocal identity [39] and from the boundary integral
approach [4, 15].

Hydrodynamic interactions appear at ﬁrst iteration,
represented by the oﬀ-diagonal terms in the generalized
friction matrix. The expressions for the leading oﬀ-
diagonal terms are

the one-body solutions for the force and torque obtained
at the zeroth iteration.

The most remarkable feature of the force and torque
that results is that they depend not only on the relative
position of the particles, as in a passive suspension of
spheres, but also on their orientations. Thus active col-
loids, even if they are geometrically isotropic, are hydro-
dynamically anisotropic. The source of this anisotropy is
the slip which, necessarily, has associated with it a pair
of mutually perpendicular directions. An intuitive un-
derstanding of the source of the orientation-dependent
forces and torques can be obtained by studying Fig. (2).
The ﬁrst panel plots the ﬂow around a passive particle
where the direction of the velocity is determined solely
by the sum of the body forces. Changing the particle
orientation does not change the ﬂow and, therefore, pro-
duces no change to the force, shown by the white ar-
rows, on the two test particles. The second panel plots
the ﬂow around an active particle where the slip con-
tains the modes lσ = 2s and lσ = 3t. The forces on the
two test particles are shown by the white arrows. In the
third panel, the active particle is rotated clockwise by
π/2, without any change in position. The forces are now
vastly diﬀerent, even though there has been no changes
in relative positions. Similar considerations apply for the
torque as the reader can easily verify. It is precisely these
orientation-dependent forces and torques that lead to the
rich and surprising dynamics in active suspensions and
distinguishes them from passive suspensions.

In the next section, we use the pairwise-additive form
of the hydrodynamic interaction to explore the dynamics
of minimally active colloids in an optical lattice.

IV. DYNAMICS IN AN OPTICAL LATTICE

In the previous section, we derived the leading ele-
ments of the generalized friction matrix for minimally
active colloids. Hydrodynamic interactions appear at the
ﬁrst Jacobi iteration and, at that order, have a pairwise-
additive character. The force and torque between hydro-
dynamically interacting colloids can be obtained from the
solutions provided in the previous section. Here, we use
those forms of the force and torque to perform dynamical
simulations for minimal active colloids trapped in an op-
tical lattice. This demonstrates the utility of our method
for numerical work.

The eﬀect of harmonic conﬁnement on hydrodynami-
cally interactive active colloidal particles was ﬁrst studied
using lattice-Boltzmann simulations by Nash et al
[40]
and further studied by singularity [41] and boundary in-
tegral [15] methods. The choice of slip in all these studies
corresponded to a minimally active colloid without self-
rotation,

FIG. 3. Convective re-orientations of three active particles in
a holographic trap made of three harmonic potentials. The
trap centers are at (−20a, 20a), (0, 0) and (20a, 20a). The par-
ticles are initialized on the north pole of the sphere orienting
radially outward. This corresponds to one-body stable posi-
tion. The top panel has the ﬂow-ﬁelds of the system with the
initial condition corresponding to all particles pointing radi-
ally outwards at the north sphere of the schematic sphere and
bottom panel shows the dynamics. The green curved arrows
on the ﬂow-ﬁelds show the direction of rotation. The cen-
tral particle does not have a dynamics by symmetry. The left
particle rotated clockwise and right one in counter-clockwise
sense which can be explained from the ﬂow diagram.

in an optical lattice. The correspondence between our
choice of slip and the spherical harmonic parametrization
used in Lighthill [37] and Blake [38] is fully discussed in
[15]. In the present notation, we retain slip modes corre-
sponding to lσ = 1s, 2s and 3t. The ﬂow corresponding
to these modes in plotted in Fig. (2). The body force
and torque acting on the colloid due to the conﬁning trap
potential is

n = −k(Rn − R0);
Fb

Tb

n = 0,

(34)

where k is the stiﬀness of the trap and R0
n is the trap cen-
ter. The instantaneous linear and angular velocities are
obtained, respectively, by balancing forces and torques.
The positions and orientations are then updated through

through the kinematic equations

˙Rn = Vn,

˙pn = Ωn × pn.

(35)

We use the PyStokes library for completing these numer-
ical steps [42].

We remind ourselves, ﬁrst, of the dynamics of N active
colloids in a harmonic trap without hydrodynamic inter-
actions. A particle at location R experiences a harmonic
force −k(R − R0) which tends to pull it to the trap cen-
ter R0. The stable state is at the trap center where the
force is zero. An active colloid, on the other hand has
an additional active force which enables the particle to
move away from the conﬁnement. Balancing active and
passive contributions gives

− 6πηa · (Vn − vspn) − k(Rn − R0) = 0,

− 8πηa3 · Ωn = 0.

(36a)

(36b)

For a particle at rest, Vn = 0 in a trap whose center is at
the origin, this gives a conﬁnement radius R∗ [15, 40, 43]
− 6πηa· vs − kR∗ = 0 =⇒ R∗ = 6πηavs/k = Aa. (37)
Here A is a dimensionless number indicating the ratio of
the strength of active propulsive to the passive conﬁning
force. As there is no angular velocity, the state with all
particles pointing radially outwards on a shell of radius
R(cid:63) is dynamically stable without hydrodynamic interac-
tions [43]. This state is destabilized with hydrodynamic
interactions [15, 40, 41] due to the rotation induced by
the vorticity of the monopolar ﬂow of each particle [15].
The combination of one-body self-propulsion and two-
body reorientation yields orbits in a pair of conﬁned par-
ticles. These individual orbits coalesce to produce sus-
tained convection in a conﬁned suspension [15] producing
the so-called ‘self-assembled pump’ [40].

With this background, we now turn to the dynam-
ics of active colloids in a lattice of traps as is com-
monly obtained in optical lattice experiments. In a one-
dimensional lattice of traps, we ﬁnd a stable, stationary
state with all the colloids pointing in the same direc-
tion. Therefore, we explore two-dimensional lattices, be-
ginning with the simplest unit cell of a hexagonal lattice.
The dynamics is shown in Fig. (3). For our choice of
symmetric initial conditions, the colloid at the central
vertex does not move, while the colloids in the two re-
maining vertices rotate with a ﬁxed period. The particle
on its left rotates clockwise and particle on its right rotate
counterclockwise. The radius of the orbit is determined
by the balance of the one-body active force and trap-
ping force, as discussed above, while the leading order
torque from two-body hydrodynamics leads to rotation.
The magnitude of the torque depends on the relative po-
sition of the particles [15] and, in particular, vanishes for
collinear particles. Thus, stationary states with motion
can be seen only in a non-collinear arrangement of traps.

FIG. 4. Snapshots and corresponding ﬂow-ﬁelds from a simu-
lation of 3× 3 holographic trap of active particles at diﬀerent
times in terms of τr = 8πηa/k. There are 9 representative
spheres in each frame, centered at each trap of the holograph,
of radius R∗ (Eq. 37). Red dot and straight green arrow
denote the position and orientation respectively, with a cor-
responding curved green arrow showing the direction of ro-
tation. With the given initial conditions, the colloid at the
central vertex does not move, while the colloids in the two
remaining vertices rotate with a ﬁxed period. The particle on
its left rotates clockwise and particle on its right rotate coun-
terclockwise. The dynamics is synchronized about the central
vertex. This can be understood by inspecting the ﬂow ﬁeld.
See the supplementary movie for the dynamics.

With this understanding, we study dynamics in a 3× 3
square lattice of traps. These can be realised experimen-
tally with a holographic tweezer setup. The dynamics is
shown in Fig. (4). The particles on center do not rotate
by symmetry while particle on their left rotate clockwise
and particle on their right rotate counter-clockwise. This
can be understood by looking at ﬂow-ﬁeld and the three
particle dynamics shown in Fig, (3). The particles at
equal distance about the symmetric plane have synchro-
nized dynamics. This leads to a long ranged correlation
between the particles in a holographic trap. Also, the
particles at top rotate at a higher rate than those on the
bottom due to a higher hydrodynamic torque acting at
lower part of the trap. In summary, (a) there is a rota-
tional instability in the system if the traps centers are not
collinear, and b) dynamics is synchronized about an axis
of symmetry in non-collinear traps. We urge experiments
to verify these ﬁndings.

V. SUSPENSION STRESS

In this section we obtain an exact expression for the
coarse-grained suspension stress in terms of the general-
ized friction matrix. Landau and Lifshitz showed that
the state of stress in a suspension, averaged over scales
large compare to the particle size, is given by [5]

σ = 2ηE + Σ(p)

is the contribution to the stress from the particles, E is
the macroscopic strain rate and V is the volume of the
suspension. The symmetric part of each integral in the
particle contribution was denoted by Batchelor as the
stresslet [6].

To determine the particle contribution to the stress, it
is necessary to obtain the ﬁrst moment of the traction
in the presence of an externally imposed ﬂow v∞ with
strain rate E. This introduces an additional term in the
boundary integral equation and leads to the following
modiﬁed linear algebraic system

As advertised earlier, the third row of the generalized fric-

Considering a force-free, torque-free suspension and
choosing v∞ to correspond to an uniform strain rate,
such that the only non-vanishing coeﬃcient is V∞(2s) =

The ﬁrst two terms are the one-body and many-body
contributions due to the external ﬂow, while the last two
terms are the one-body and many-body contributions
due to activity. The one-body terms are O(φ) where φ
is the suspension volume fraction, while the many-body
terms are O(φ2) and higher. The above expression must
be statistically averaged over the position and orienta-
tion of the particles to obtain the average stress in the
suspension. Since a spherical particles does not rotate in
a pure shear ﬂow its orientational distribution function
remains unchanged.
In an isotropic suspension, there-
fore, the average (cid:104)V(2s)
n (cid:105){pn} vanishes and there is no
contribution to the suspension stress at O(φ) due to ac-
tivity, as was ﬁrst pointed out by Pedley and Ishikawa
[44]. Therefore, a dilute suspension of spherical active
colloids is rheologically identical to a passive suspension
of spheres.

The exact relation between the suspension stress and
the generalized friction matrix obtained above can be
used to derive the O(φ2) and higher corrections to the

suspension stress. Such a calculation requires a careful
regularization of conditionally convergent integrals [45]
and will be presented in a future work.

VI. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

By exploiting the linearity of slow viscous ﬂow, as
clearly manifested in the boundary integral representa-
tion, we have derived linear relations between the modes
of the traction and the active slip in a suspension of active
spheres. From these linear relations, we directly obtain
the forces, torques, suspension stress, and power dissi-
pation in an active suspension. In addition, the bound-
ary integral representation provides the ﬂuid ﬂow at any
point in the bulk, without needed to resolve bulk ﬂuid de-
grees of freedom. This leads to accurate and eﬃcient nu-
merical simulations when compared against methods that
resolve the bulk ﬂuid. Since forces and torques are funda-
mental dynamical quantities in Newtonian or Langevin

descriptions of particle dynamics, our contribution forms
the basis for a microscopic theory of active suspension
mechanics and statistical mechanics that conserves mo-
mentum in both the bulk ﬂuid and at ﬂuid-solid bound-
aries. Applications of our method to the crystallization
of active colloids near walls, to collective phenomena in
magnetotactic colloids and to active rheology will be pre-
sented in forthcoming work as will be the extension of our
method to ellipsoidal particles.

Appendix B: Diagonal approximation

In this section, we present the exact solution for one active particle which is also the diagonal approximation of the
linear system for the iterative solution. Equation (12) can be solved exactly by using orthogonality of the tensorial
spherical harmonics on the surface of an sphere in an unbounded ﬂuid. The double layer contribution for one body,
diagonal approximation for many-body, is identically, −4πη V(l) [15] for each l. The linear system for one particle is
then

Using the irreducible decomposition, Eq. (15), to write the coeﬃcients of traction and velocity [15, 25, 26],

To this end, we deﬁne a projection operator Pσ which projects the σth component of the traction and velocity
coeﬃcients such that

Pσ · F(l) = F(lσ).
where Pσ satisﬁes the properties of a projection operator, Pσ · Pσ(cid:48)
relation between the traction and velocity coeﬃcients, for one-body, is both diagonal and scalar for each l and σ,

= δσσ(cid:48). Using this irreducible choice, we ﬁnd the

The leading terms in the relations are [4, 15]

The ﬁrst of these equations shows that translation and rotation are possible in the absence of external forces and

can be obtained fromγ(l, l(cid:48))

nm by application of the projection operator P(σ) given in Eq. (B3).
