The low temperature properties of single level molecular quantum dots including both, electron-
electron and electron-vibration interactions, are theoretically investigated. The calculated diﬀeren-
tial conductance in the Kondo regime exhibits not only the zero bias anomaly but also side peaks
located at bias voltages which coincide with multiples of the energy of vibronic mode V ∼ Ω/e.
We obtain that the evolution with temperature of the two main satellite conductance peaks follows
the corresponding one of the Kondo peak when Ω ≫ kBTK , being TK the Kondo temperature, in
agreement with recent transport measurements in molecular junctions. However, we ﬁnd that this
is no longer valid when Ω is of the order of a few times kBTK.

INTRODUCTION

ing the numerical renormalization group

The Kondo eﬀect, originally discovered in metals
containing magnetic impurities,1,2 is also observed in
transport measurements through semiconducting3–9 and
molecular10–19 quantum dots (QDs) in which the QD acts
as a single magnetic impurity. While the semiconducting
QDs are characterized by the tunability of its parame-
ters and have served as platforms to study the one- and
two-channel,3,5,7,20 as well as the SU(4) Kondo eﬀect,21
the molecular QDs (MQDs) have allowed researchers
to investigate, among diﬀerent phenomena, the under-
screened Kondo eﬀect for spin S > 1/214,15,18 and quan-
tum phase transitions driven by stretching14,22 or gate
voltage.15,18 Remarkably, MQDs incorporate the eﬀect of
phonons. Molecular vibration signatures have been ob-
served in conductance measurements through a variety of
molecules, such as H2,23 and C140.24 Furthermore, exper-
iments performed in the Kondo regime have revealed the
presence of satellite peaks at ﬁnite bias which emerge to-
gether with the zero-bias anomaly in the diﬀerential con-
ductance as a consequence of the interplay between the
electron-vibration interaction and the many-body Kondo
state.14,25–29

Recently, Rakhmilevitch et al. reported on transport
measurements through a copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc)
molecule connected to two silver contacts in a break-
junction setup.29 Their work focuses on the evolution
with temperature of the side peaks observed in the dif-
ferential conductance. The authors ﬁnd that the max-
imum conductance of the side peaks increases when
the temperature is lowered following the same depen-
dence as the zero-bias Kondo peak. Speciﬁcally (since
CuPc possess a spin-1/2,29,30) the intensity of both, the
zero-bias anomaly and the satellite peaks, can be ﬁtted
with the same empirical expression for the temperature-
dependence of the equilibrium conductance of a spin-1/2
impurity, G(T ), which follows closely results obtained us-

G(T, V = 0) =

Gs

h1 +(cid:0)21/s − 1(cid:1) (T /TK)2is ,

(1)

where s = 0.22,3,31 Gs is the conductance at temper-
ature T = 0, and the Kondo temperature TK is the
only adjustable parameter. Outstandingly, the ﬁtted
Kondo scale for the satellite peaks located at bias volt-
age eV ∼ ±Ω ∼ ±21 meV , agrees with the one ob-
tained for the Kondo peak (21 K < TK < 25 K). This
is an interesting result for two main reasons: ﬁrst, it is
not evident that the empirical expression Eq. (1), that
correctly gives the universal temperature dependence of
the conductance without vibrational modes, can be ap-
plied when the Kondo phenomena is assisted by phonons.
More surprising is the fact that Eq. (1) still works out
of equilibrium, for ﬁtting the conductance at ﬁnite bias
voltages of the order of |V | ∼ Ω/e. While the satellite
peaks have been studied theoretically before,32,33 their
dependence on temperature has not been analyzed.

Motivated by the experiment of Rakhmilevitch et
al., in this article we investigate theoretically the low-
temperature transport properties of a single level molec-
ular quantum dot including both, electron-electron and
electron-vibration interactions.
In agreement with the
experimental results, we obtain that the conductance of
the two main satellite peaks follows the same tempera-
ture evolution as the corresponding Kondo peak, which
means that these peaks are also a manifestation of the
Kondo eﬀect, when Ω ≫ kBTK, which is in fact the
regime of the experiment. On the other hand, the state-
ment is no longer valid when both energy scales are sim-
ilar, Ω ≈ 3kBTK. For Ω ≤ kBTK, the satellite peaks
merge with the Kondo peak.34

II. MODEL AND FORMALISM

We model the MQD with the Anderson-Holstein
Hamiltonian32–38 in which a spin-1/2 doublet of energy
Ed is connected to two metallic reservoirs and also cou-
pled to a phonon mode of frequency Ω, through the
electron-phonon interaction λ. The Hamiltonian is

σ creates an elec-

creates a conduction electron at the left (ν = L) or right
(ν = R) lead, and V ν
k describe the hopping elements be-
tween the leads and the molecular state. We take the
limit of very large Coulomb repulsion U → ∞.

We use the non-crossing approximation (NCA) in its
non-equilibrium extension.33,42 The out of equilibrium
NCA approach has proved to be a very valuable tech-
nique for calculating the diﬀerential conductance through
a variety of systems including two-level QD’s and C60
molecules displaying a quantum phase transition,18,43,44
among others.
it is specially suitable
for describing satellite peaks away from the zero bias
voltage45–47 and captures the universal behavior in the
equilibrium conductance given by Eq. (1).48,49 The ap-
plication of the NCA to the model and its limitations for
large λ are described in detail in Ref. 33

Furthermore,

The current through the molecule is calculated using

the exact expression41,42

k) (assumed independent
of energy) is the coupling of the molecule to the lead ν,
f (ω) is the Fermi distribution and the spectral function
of the molecule is given by ρ(ω), which we calculate us-
ing the NCA. The right and left chemical potentials µν
of the metallic contacts are proportional to the bias volt-
age. For simplicity we assume a symmetric voltage drop
µL = −µR = eV /2. The results are not aﬀected by this
assumption.

The reduced intensity of the zero-bias peak in the ex-
periment suggests that there is a large asymmetry be-
tween the two tunneling couplings Γν. This is usually
the case in MQDs. We choose ΓR ≈ 50ΓL (similar values
do not aﬀect our conclusions). We note that for ratios
of the couplings larger than 10 (i. e. highly asymmet-
ric devices), the diﬀerential conductance G = dI/dV at
bias voltage |V | . kBTK/e reproduces the equilibrium
spectral density of the Kondo resonance.50

While the value of the vibration frequency is well de-
ﬁned by the position of the satellite peaks in the conduc-
tance measurements (Ω ∼ 21 meV), neither the value of

2

the total coupling ΓR + ΓL nor the energy position of the
Kondo active molecular level Ed are clearly determined.
Therefore, we analyzed several values of both energies to
conﬁrm that our conclusions remain the same. The esti-
mated value for the electron-vibration interaction λ, that
corresponds to a breathing mode of the CuPc molecule, is
found from ab-initio calculations to be near λ0 = 6 meV.
Since the Kondo scale strongly depends on the electron-
phonon coupling,33 in the present work, we tested several
values of λ, from 6 to 12 meV. We veriﬁed that our anal-
ysis regarding the ratio kBTK/Ω, holds for the whole
set of λ’s studied.

III. THE MAIN KONDO PEAK

We start by a brief review of the temperature evo-
lution of the Kondo peak in Fig. 1(a) and the scal-
ing law of the zero-bias conductance with Eq.
(1) in
Fig. 1(b) in absence of the electron-phonon interaction.
The asymmetry in G(V ) is due to the asymmetric Γν.50
For the parameters of the ﬁgure, the Kondo scale re-
sulting from the ﬁt using Eq.
(1), TK = 43 ± 1 K,
remarkably agrees with the corresponding one in Fig.
1(c) extracted from a ﬁtting of the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the zero-bias anomaly using the
expression39,51 FWHM= 1
ing in this case TK = 43 ± 1 K, with α an extra ﬁtting
parameter. This expression for the FWHM gives a value
of 2kBTK/e at zero temperature, and is expected to coin-
cide with the FWHM of the equilibrium spectral density
for large asymmetric devices in the Kondo limit.50 We
must warn the reader that the Kondo scale determined
from the width of the spectral density can be 10% larger
that the corresponding one obtained from the temper-
ature dependence of the conductance.52 The scaling of
G(V, T ) for small V and T and also under an applied
magnetic ﬁeld has been investigated experimentally and
theoretically.7,8,16,48,53,54

ep(αkBT )2 + (2kBTK)2, be-

As we stated before, when the coupling to the vibration
mode of the molecule is taken into account, it is not ob-
vious that G(T /TK) and FWHM(T ) are still described
with the same expressions.
In Fig. 2(a) we show the
diﬀerential conductance as a function of the bias volt-
age for several temperatures and λ = 12 meV. All the
parameters are the same as in Fig. 1. As the tempera-
ture decreases, the zero-bias peak emerges together with
lateral satellite peaks at voltages corresponding to the
energy of the vibration mode eV = ±Ω = ±21 meV.
Other satellites peaks with reduced intensity at multiples
of the vibration energy should also be present,32,33 but
they are beyond the scope of this work. The intensity of
the two main satellite conductance peaks increases with
increasing λ.32,33 Fig. 2b displays the zero-bias conduc-
tance as a function of temperature and the corresponding
scaling result using Eq. (1). We obtained a Kondo tem-
perature TK = 20 ± 1 K, which is markedly reduced due
to the eﬀect of the electron-phonon coupling λ, but the

decrease is smaller than expected from a Franck-Condon
factor. The non-trivial reduction of TK with the electron-
phonon coupling λ has been discussed before.33,34,38 We
conclude that the only change in the temperature evolu-
tion of the zero-bias Kondo peak is given by the Kondo
scale, but the universal behavior is not aﬀected.

The high precision of the ﬁtting, with a correlation
factor of 0.9995, indicates that for low enough tempera-
tures and energies (kBT ≪ Ω) the system behaves as a
Fermi-liquid with renormalized parameters in which the
phonon-mode is not active.

In Fig. 2(c) we show the FWHM of the zero bias
anomaly as a function of temperature and the corre-

sponding scaling being α = 9.9 ± 0.5 and TK = 22 ± 1 K.
This independent analysis supports the previous one ob-
tained with the data from Fig. 2(b) and interestingly, the
adjustable parameter α diﬀers only by 4% to the corre-
sponding value without coupling to phonons (Fig. 1(c).

IV. THE SATELLITE PEAKS

In what follows we focus on the analysis of the evolu-
tion with temperature of the two main satellite conduc-
tance peaks shown in Fig. 2(a). In contrast to the left
satellite, the maximum of the right one is slightly renor-
malized to higher voltages within the NCA. This might
be due to the fact that the NCA does not incorporate
renormalization of the bare phonon propagator, and it
contributes in a diﬀerent way for positive and negative
frequencies.33 However, we have veriﬁed that both side
peaks follow identical temperature dependence.55

In Fig. 3(a), the satellite conductance at bias voltages
near eV ∼ 
e Ω is displayed after removing a linear oﬀset
for several temperatures.56 From the maximum values,
in Fig. 3(b) we built the curve of G(V ∼ 
e Ω, T ) as a
function of temperature and its ﬁtting by using Eq. (1).
As in the experiment of Rakhmilevitch et al., the values
of G(V ∼ 
e Ω, T ) are very well represented by the empir-
ical law, being the adjustable parameter TK = 21 ± 1 K
in perfect agreement with the Kondo temperature ex-
tracted from the central Kondo peak (20 K).57 Regard-
ing the left satellite peak, we found TK = 24 ± 1 K. On
the other hand, we ﬁnd that contrary to what happens
for the Kondo peak, the width of the satellite peaks is
not related to the Kondo temperature. Fig. 3(c) shows
the FWHM of the peak at V ∼ Ω/e as a function of
temperature. The parameters extracted from the ﬁt dif-
fer with respect to those from the central peak, being

α = 6.1 ± 0.5 and a low-temperature width 49 ± 5 K. The
increase of the width is expected from the occurrence of
inelastic processes. A similar behavior is found for the
ﬁrst satellite peak below the Fermi energy. We could not
conﬁrm that the same behavior is valid for further satel-
lite peaks due to the lower intensity of the latter and
technical limitations of the NCA calculations.

Since the maxima of the conductance of the satel-
lite peaks have the same temperature dependence as the
Kondo peak, and are scaled with almost the same Kondo
temperature, we conclude that the side peaks are (broad-
ened) replicas of the Kondo peak. As we stated in the
introduction, this is not expected a priori and it would
be desirable to have a physical explanation for this. We
have extended the variational approach of the Anderson
model for the impurity spectral density below the Fermi
level explained in Ref. 1 to include phonons. Perform-
ing perturbations at lowest order in the electron-phonon
interaction λ, we ﬁnd a replica at the expected position
with relative intensity (λ/Ω)2. Basically, annihilation
of the dot electron in the perturbed ground state leads
in part (with an amplitude λ/Ω) to the same excited
states as in the ordinary Anderson model except for the
fact that they contain a phonon and thus their energy is
shifted by Ω (in leading order). This simple approach
works qualitatively in the regime Ω ≫ kBTK. How-
ever for Ω ≈ kBTK, the energy denominators in a more
reﬁned perturbative treatment might be near Ω ± TK
and depending on the particular energy of the perturbed
Kondo states, the amplitudes might be diﬀerent, distort-
ing the side peaks.

In order to test the above physical picture, we study a
diﬀerent regime in which Ω is of the order of kBTK.
For simplicity, we use a reduced value of the vibra-
tion frequency Ω = 5 meV, changing the other param-
eters in order to analyze diﬀerent values of the ratio
Ω/kBTK. The top panel of Fig. 4 displays a comparison
of the normalized diﬀerential conductance, G(V = 0)/Gs
and G(V ∼ Ω/e)/Gs, as a function of kBT /Ω for
2 and Fig.
the data in Fig.
3 respectively. As we
already discussed,
in this particular regime for which
Ω/kBTK = 11, the evolution with temperature of the
zero-bias peak and the satellite conductance peaks is the
same. On the other hand, the lower panel shows that
the temperature evolution is no longer the same in the
case of Ω/kBTK = 3. Here we have used Ω = 5 meV,
ΓR + ΓL = 80 meV, Ed = −40 meV and λ = 12 meV. For
this choice of parameters the energy scale obtained from
Eq. (1) is found to be 19±1 K in the case of G(V = 0)/Gs
and it still represents the Kondo temperature. In fact,
this value agrees with the corresponding one obtained
from the FWHM of the zero bias anomaly. However,
the adjustable parameter extracted from a ﬁtting of the
temperature dependence of the inelastic peak at positive
voltage G(V ∼ Ω/e)/Gs is found to be 30 ± 1 K, near
twice larger than TK. We have veriﬁed that this deviation
is always present when kBTK approaches Ω varying Ω
from 5 to 21 meV and also Ed from −40 to −90 meV. We

cannot reach the range for which Ω/kBTK ∼ 1 due to
the fact that larger values of TK drive the system towards
a mixed valence regime for which there is no universal be-
havior of the conductance. A possible way to avoid this
limitation would be to use unrealistic small values of the
electron-phonon interaction λ.

V. SUMMARY

In conclusion, we have veriﬁed theoretically that the
empirical expression for the temperature dependence of
the conductance given by Eq.
(1) still works to ex-
tract the Kondo scale in transport measurements through
molecules with active phonon modes for temperatures
kBT < Ω. It is also able to reproduce the temperature
dependence of the out-of-equilibrium conductance peaks
at ﬁnite bias voltages of the order of |V | ∼ Ω/e with the
same energy scale when kBTK ≪ Ω. These side peaks
are however broader than the central Kondo peak due to
inelastic eﬀects. In cases for which kBTK ∼ Ω, while
the same expression is able to ﬁt the temperature depen-
dence of of G(V = 0) and G(|V | ∼ Ω/e) the resulting
energy scales do not coincide with each other, which is
an indication of diﬀerent functional dependence. As a
concluding remark, we want to stress here that the ra-
tio Ω/kBTK could be very diﬀerent depending on the
experimental system due to the particular frequencies of
the vibration modes of the tested molecule and also due
to the couplings of the molecule to the metallic contacts.

55 We have also replaced the bare phonon propagator by the
dressed one including corrections to second order in λ, re-
sulting in very small changes in the satellite peaks and to
the same temperature dependence.

56 The satellite peaks are mounted on the tail of the main
Kondo peak (see Fig. 1). We have subtracted this tail as-
suming a linear dependence, which is justiﬁed due ti the
small curvature of the main peak at the energies of the
satellites.

57 We note that if instead of following the maximum of the
satellite peak in G(V ) for each temperature, a ﬁxed V is
taken (for example the position of the maximum at T = 0),
the scaling law is not obeyed.
