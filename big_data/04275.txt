A SINGULAR, ADMISSIBLE EXTENSION WHICH SPLITS

ALGEBRAICALLY, BUT NOT STRONGLY, OF THE ALGEBRA

OF BOUNDED OPERATORS ON A BANACH SPACE

TOMASZ KANIA, NIELS JAKOB LAUSTSEN, AND RICHARD SKILLICORN

In memoriam: Charles J. Read (1958–2015)

Abstract. Let E be the Banach space constructed by Read (J. London Math. Soc. 1989)
such that the Banach algebra B(E) of bounded operators on E admits a discontinuous
derivation. We show that B(E) has a singular, admissible extension which splits alge-
braically, but does not split strongly. This answers a natural question going back to the
work of Bade, Dales, and Lykova (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 1999), and complements recent
results of Laustsen and Skillicorn (C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, to appear).

1. Introduction and the main result

An extension of a Banach algebra B is a short-exact sequence of the form

{0}

/ ker ϕ

/ A

ϕ

/ B

/ {0},

(1.1)

where A is a Banach algebra and ϕ : A → B is a continuous, surjective algebra homomor-
phism. The extension is singular if ker ϕ has the trivial product, that is, ab = 0 for each
a, b ∈ ker ϕ. We say that the extension splits algebraically (respectively, splits strongly, is
admissible) if ϕ has a right inverse which is an algebra homomorphism (respectively, is a
continuous algebra homomorphism, is bounded and linear). Every extension which splits
strongly is evidently admissible and splits algebraically, and the admissibility of (1.1) is
equivalent to ker ϕ being complemented in A as a Banach space.

Motivated by Bade, Dales, and Lykova’s comprehensive study [1] of extensions of Banach
algebras, the second- and third-named authors [6] investigated the interrelationship among
the above properties for extensions of Banach algebras of the form B(E), that is, all
bounded operators acting on a Banach space E, showing that there exist Banach spaces E1
and E2 such that:

(i) B(E1) has a singular extension which splits algebraically, but the extension is not

admissible, and so it does not split strongly;

(ii) B(E2) has a singular extension which is admissible, but it does not split algebraically.

These results naturally raise the following question:

Does there exist a Banach space E such that B(E) has an admissible

extension which splits algebraically, but not strongly?

The purpose of this note is to answer this question positively.

Theorem 1.1. There exist a Banach space E and a continuous, surjective algebra homo-
morphism ϕ from a unital Banach algebra A onto B(E) such that the extension

{0}

/ ker ϕ

/ A

ϕ

/ B(E)

/ {0}

(1.2)

is singular and admissible and splits algebraically, but it does not split strongly.

In fact, the Banach spaces E1 and E2 used to establish statements (i) and (ii) above are
equal (but the extensions are obviously distinct), both being the Banach space ER con-
structed by Read [10] with the property that there is a discontinuous derivation from B(ER)
into a one-dimensional B(ER)-bimodule. This Banach space will also play the role of E
in Theorem 1.1.

It is no coincidence that the Banach algebra B(E) associated with the Banach space E
in Theorem 1.1 admits a discontinuous derivation. Indeed, a Banach algebra B which has
an extension that splits algebraically, but not strongly, obviously admits a discontinuous
algebra homomorphism. This property is generally weaker than admitting a discontinuous
derivation. However, if in addition we require that the extension be singular and admissible,
then B must admit a discontinuous derivation.

To see this, suppose contrapositively that every derivation from B into a Banach B-bi-
module is continuous. Then, by a theorem of Dales and Villena (see [4, Corollary 2.2], or
[2, Corollary 2.7.7] for an exposition), every intertwining map (as deﬁned on p. 4 below)
from B into a Banach B-bimodule is continuous, and therefore, using [1, Theorem 2.13]
or [2, Theorem 2.8.16], we conclude that every singular, admissible extension of B which
splits algebraically also splits strongly. This result implies in particular that every singu-
lar, admissible extension of the compact operators K (ER) which splits algebraically also
splits strongly, in contrast to Theorem 1.1, because Read showed that ER has a Schauder
basis [10, Lemma 5.3], and hence every derivation from K (ER) into a K (ER)-bimodule
is continuous (see [10, Theorem 5.2] or [2, Corollary 5.3.9]).

The usefulness of Read’s Banach space ER in the context of extensions originates from
the following theorem, which strengthens and clariﬁes the main technical results underlying
Read’s construction of a discontinuous derivation from B(ER) (see [10, p. 306 and Sec-
tion 4]). In it, we denote by ℓ∼
2 the unitization of the Hilbert space ℓ2 endowed with the
trivial product, so that ℓ∼
2 = ℓ2 ⊕ K1 as a vector space (where K denotes the scalar ﬁeld,
either R or C, and 1 is the formal identity that we adjoin), and the product and norm
on ℓ∼

2 are given by

(ξ + s1)(η + t1) = sη + tξ + st1 and kξ + s1k = kξk + |s|

(ξ, η ∈ ℓ2, s, t ∈ K).

Theorem 1.2 ([7, Theorem 1.2]). There exists a continuous, surjective algebra homomor-
phism ψ : B(ER) → ℓ∼
2 with ker ψ = W (ER) (the ideal of weakly compact operators on ER)
such that the extension

/ {0}

(1.3)

splits strongly.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Throughout, all Banach spaces and algebras are considered over the same scalar ﬁeld K,
where either K = R or K = C.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let X and Y be Banach spaces, and let S : X → Y be a linear map. The
separating space of S is given by

S(S) = {y ∈ Y : there is a null sequence (xn)n∈N in X such that Sxn → y as n → ∞}.

We shall require the following fundamental facts about the separating space; see, e.g.,
[2, Propositions 5.1.2 and 5.2.2(ii)] or [11, Lemmas 1.2(i)–(ii) and 1.3(ii)]. The second
clause is of course just a restatement of the Closed Graph Theorem. It explains why the
separating space plays an important role in automatic continuity theory.

Proposition 2.2. Let X and Y be Banach spaces, and let S : X → Y be a linear map.
Then:

(i) S(S) is a closed subspace of Y ;
(ii) S is bounded if and only if S(S) = {0}.
(iii) Let Z be a Banach space, and suppose that T : Y → Z is bounded and linear. Then

S(T S) = T [S(S)].

The pullback of Banach algebras. As in [6], the connection between the extension (1.3)
of ℓ∼
2 and the extension (1.2) of B(ER) that we aim to establish goes via the pullback
construction, which we shall now review. Let α : A → C and β : B → C be continuous
algebra homomorphisms between Banach algebras A , B, and C , and set

D = {(a, b) ∈ A ⊕ B : α(a) = β(b)},

(2.1)

where A ⊕ B denotes the Banach-algebra direct sum of A and B. For later reference, we
note that D is unital in the case where A , B, C , α, and β are unital. Let γ and δ be the
restrictions to D of the coordinate projections:

γ : (a, b) 7→ a, D → A ,

and

δ : (a, b) 7→ b, D → B.

(2.2)

They are continuous algebra homomorphisms, and the triple (D, γ, δ) has the universal
property of pullbacks, as observed in [6, Section 2], where the following connection with
extensions is also established.

(i) (2.5) is singular if and only if (2.3) is singular.

Then (2.5) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible) if and only
if (2.3) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible).

Derivations and intertwining maps. Throughout this paragraph, A denotes a Banach
algebra, and X is a Banach A -bimodule. The annihilator of A in X is given by

annA X = {x ∈ X : a · x = 0 = x · a for each a ∈ A }.

Let S : A → X be a linear map, and consider the bilinear map

(2.6)
We say that S is a derivation if δ1S = 0, while S is an intertwining map if δ1S is continuous.

δ1S : (a, b) 7→ a · (Sb) − S(ab) + (Sa) · b, A × A → X.

Using δ1S, we can deﬁne an algebra product on the vector space A ⊕ X as follows:

(a, x)(b, y) = (ab, a · y + x · b + (δ1S)(a, b))

(a, b ∈ A , x, y ∈ X).

(2.7)

Suppose that S is an intertwining map. Then the above product is continuous with respect
to the norm k(a, x)k = kak + kxk for a ∈ A and x ∈ X, and so A ⊕ X is a Banach algebra
with respect to an equivalent norm. The map

πA : (a, x) 7→ a, A ⊕ X → A ,

is clearly a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism with kernel {0} ⊕ X, which has
the trivial product, so that we obtain a singular extension of A :

{0}

/ {0} ⊕ X

/ A ⊕ X

πA

/ A

/ {0}.

(2.8)

Moreover, this extension is admissible because a 7→ (a, 0), A → A ⊕ X, is a bounded,
linear right inverse of πA , and it splits algebraically because a 7→ (a, −Sa), A → A ⊕ X,
is an algebra homomorphism which is also a right inverse of πA . A direct calculation shows
that (2.8) splits strongly if and only if there is a derivation D : A → X such that S − D
is continuous. This is a well-known generalization of results in pure algebra, going back
to Johnson [5, Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2]; see also [2, Theorem 2.8.12] and the text
preceding it.

A SINGULAR, ADMISSIBLE EXTENSION WHICH SPLITS ALGEBRAICALLY, NOT STRONGLY 5

As we have already indicated, our strategy is to construct an extension with suitably
chosen properties of the unitization of ℓ2 endowed with the trivial product, and then apply
Proposition 2.3 together with Theorem 1.2 to obtain the desired extension of B(ER).
Adjoining an identity to an extension is straightforward, in the sense that it does not alter
any of the properties that we are interested in. Consequently, we shall henceforth focus
our attention on the case where the Banach algebra A has the trivial product. It turns
out that we may also simplify matters by supposing that the bimodule X has the trivial
right action; that is, ab = 0 and x · a = 0 for each a, b ∈ A and x ∈ X.
In this case,
derivations and intertwining maps have nice characterizations in terms of the annihilator
and the separating space.

Lemma 2.4. Let A be a Banach algebra with the trivial product, let X be a Banach
A -bimodule with the trivial right action, and let S : A → X be a linear map. Then:

(i) S is a derivation if and only if S[A ] ⊆ annA X;
(ii) S is an intertwining map if and only if S(S) ⊆ annA X.

Proof. We begin by noting that, by the hypotheses, (2.6) reduces to

(δ1S)(a, b) = a · (Sb)

(a, b ∈ A ),

(2.9)

from which (i) follows immediately.

(ii). Suppose that S is an intertwining map, and let y ∈ S(S) and a ∈ A be given.
Since y · a = 0 by hypothesis, it remains to show that a · y = 0. Take a null sequence
(xn)n∈N in A such that Sxn → y as n → ∞. On the one hand, the continuity of the left
action of A on X implies that a · Sxn → a · y as n → ∞, while on the other the continuity
of the map δ1S given by (2.9) shows that a · Sxn = (δ1S)(a, xn) → (δ1S)(a, 0) = 0 as
n → ∞, so that a · y = 0.

Conversely, suppose that S(S) ⊆ annA X. A bilinear map is jointly continuous if (and
only if) it is separately continuous, and (2.9) shows that δ1S is continuous in the ﬁrst
variable by the continuity of the module map. Now ﬁx a ∈ A , and consider the left
action La : x 7→ a · x, X → X, which is bounded and linear. The assumption means
that La[S(S)] = {0}, so the composite map LaS is bounded by Proposition 2.2(ii)–(iii).
Hence δ1S is continuous in the second variable because (δ1S)(a, b) = (LaS)b for each
b ∈ A .
(cid:3)

For a Banach space Y , we denote by ℓ∞(N, Y ) the Banach space of all bounded sequences

in Y .

Lemma 2.5. Let A be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach algebra with the trivial product,
and let Y be a closed subspace of a Banach space X. Endow X with the trivial right
action of A , and suppose that there exists a bounded, linear injection from the quotient
space X/Y into ℓ∞(N, Y ). Then there exists a Banach left module action of A on X with
annA X = Y . The converse is true in the case where A is separable.

Proof. Let T : X/Y → ℓ∞(N, Y ) be a bounded, linear injection, and set

Ln = πnT Q : X → Y

(n ∈ N),

6

T. KANIA, N. J. LAUSTSEN, AND R. SKILLICORN

where Q : X → X/Y is the quotient map and πn : ℓ∞(N, Y ) → Y is the nth coordinate
projection. Since A is inﬁnite-dimensional, we may choose a countable biorthogonal system
(an, fn)n∈N in A × A ∗; that is, an ∈ A and fn is a bounded, linear functional on A such
that ham, fni = δm,n (the Kronecker delta) for each m, n ∈ N. Then the series

∞

converges absolutely in Y for each a ∈ A and x ∈ X, and its sum, which we shall denote
by a · x, has norm at most kak kxk. It is easy to see that (a, x) 7→ a · x, A × X → Y,
is bilinear and that a · y = 0 for each y ∈ Y , so that a · (b · x) = 0 = (ab) · x for each
a, b ∈ A and x ∈ X. Hence we have deﬁned a Banach left A -module action on X, and
Y ⊆ annA X. To prove the reverse inclusion, suppose that x ∈ annA X. Then we have

0 = am · x =

1

2mkfmk(kLmk + 1)

Lmx =

1

2mkfmk(kLmk + 1)

πmT Qx

(m ∈ N),

so that T Qx = 0, and therefore x ∈ ker Q = Y because T is injective.

To prove the converse statement in the case where A is separable, suppose that X
has a Banach left A -module action with annA X = Y , and choose a sequence (an)n∈N of
unit vectors in A with span {an : n ∈ N} = A . For each a ∈ A and x ∈ X, we have
a · x ∈ annA X = Y because A has the trivial product, so

deﬁnes a bounded, linear map with

T : x 7→ (an · x)n∈N, X → ℓ∞(N, Y ),

ker T = {x ∈ X : an · x = 0 for each n ∈ N} = annA X = Y

because span {an : n ∈ N} = A . Hence the conclusion follows from the Fundamental
Isomorphism Theorem.
(cid:3)

The following corollary summarizes what we have found so far, and what remains to be

done to achieve our goal.

Corollary 2.6. Let A be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach algebra with the trivial product,
let Y be a closed subspace of a Banach space X such that there exists a bounded, linear
injection from the quotient space X/Y into ℓ∞(N, Y ), and suppose that there exists a linear
map S : A → X with S(S) ⊆ Y . Then A has a singular, admissible extension which splits
algebraically. Further, this extension splits strongly if and only if

(S + T )[A ] ⊆ Y

(2.10)

for some bounded, linear map T : A → X.

Proof. By Lemma 2.5, we can endow X with a Banach A -bimodule structure such that the
right action is trivial and annA X = Y , and Lemma 2.4(ii) then implies that S is an inter-
twining map. Hence A ⊕X is a Banach algebra with respect to the product (2.7), and (2.8)
is a singular, admissible extension of A which splits algebraically. As we stated, this ex-
tension splits strongly if and only if S − D is continuous for some derivation D : A → X.
By Lemma 2.4(i), the latter condition is equivalent to (2.10) (take T = D − S).
(cid:3)

A SINGULAR, ADMISSIBLE EXTENSION WHICH SPLITS ALGEBRAICALLY, NOT STRONGLY 7

We now come to our main technical lemma, which will ensure that we can apply Corol-
lary 2.6 whenever the Banach algebra A satisﬁes the additional hypothesis that every
bounded, linear map from A into ℓ1 is compact. The statement of this lemma involves the
following notation and terminology.

First, the density character of a Banach space X is the smallest cardinality of a dense

subset of X.

Second, for a non-empty set Ξ, we denote by ℓ1(Ξ) the Banach space of all absolutely
summable, scalar-valued functions deﬁned on Ξ. For ξ ∈ Ξ, we write eξ for the function
which takes the value 1 at ξ and 0 elsewhere, and we write e′
ξ for the corresponding
coordinate functional, so that e′
ξi = f (ξ) for each f ∈ ℓ1(Ξ). As usual,
we write ℓ1 for ℓ1(N).

ξ is given by hf, e′

Lemma 2.7. Let Z be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space such that every bounded,
linear map from Z into ℓ1 is compact, let Ξ be a normalized Hamel basis for Z, and
consider the linear map S : Z → ℓ1(Ξ) given by Sξ = eξ for each ξ ∈ Ξ. Then

(S + T )[Z] 6⊆ S(S)

(2.11)

for each bounded, linear map T : Z → ℓ1(Ξ), and the density character of the quotient space
ℓ1(Ξ)/S(S) is no greater than the density character of Z.

Proof. No inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space has a countable Hamel basis, so the set Ξ is
necessarily uncountable. Assume towards a contradiction that (S + T )[Z] ⊆ S(S) for some
bounded, linear map T : Z → ℓ1(Ξ).

To verify that T is compact, consider a bounded sequence (zn)n∈N in Z. Then the set

Γ = [

{ξ ∈ Ξ : hT zn, e′

ξi 6= 0}

n∈N

is countable. Let P : ℓ1(Ξ) → ℓ1(Γ) be the canonical projection. By the hypothesis, P T is
compact, so (zn)n∈N has a subsequence (znj )j∈N such that (P T znj )j∈N is convergent. Since

kT zm − T znk = kP T zm − P T znk

(m, n ∈ N)

by the choice of Γ, we conclude that (T znj )j∈N is also convergent, and hence T is compact.
In particular, T has separable range and is strictly singular (see, e.g., [9, Proposi-
tions 1.11.7 and 1.11.9]), so T [Z] ⊆ span {eξ : ξ ∈ Ξ0} for some countable subset Ξ0
of Ξ, and the inﬁnite-dimensional subspace span(Ξ \ Ξ0) of Z contains a unit vector z such
that kT zk 6 1/2. Take a ﬁnite subset Υ of Ξ \ Ξ0 such that z = Pξ∈Υ sξξ for some scalars
sξ (ξ ∈ Υ). By the assumption, (S + T )z ∈ S(S), so we can ﬁnd a null sequence (xn)n∈N
in Z such that Sxn → (S + T )z as n → ∞. Write xn as xn = Pξ∈Υ sn,ξξ + yn, where
sn,ξ ∈ K (ξ ∈ Υ) and yn ∈ span(Ξ \ Υ). For each ξ ∈ Υ, we have

by the deﬁnition of S, and therefore

Syn ∈ span{eη : η ∈ Ξ \ Υ} ⊆ ker e′
ξ

sn,ξ = hSxn, e′

ξi → h(S + T )z, e′

ξi = hSz, e′

ξi + hT z, e′

ξi = sξ

as n → ∞

8

T. KANIA, N. J. LAUSTSEN, AND R. SKILLICORN

by the continuity of e′
set Υ is ﬁnite, we obtain

ξ and the fact that T z ∈ span {eη : η ∈ Ξ0} ⊆ ker e′

ξ. Using that the

yn = xn − X

sn,ξξ → 0 − X

sξξ = −z

and

For each n ∈ N, write yn as yn = Pξ∈Ξ\Υ tn,ξξ, where only ﬁnitely many of the scalars tn,ξ
are non-zero. Then by the subadditivity of the norm on Z, we have

using (2.13). This, however, contradicts that kynk → k − zk = 1 as n → ∞ by (2.12), and
consequently (2.11) follows.

To prove the ﬁnal clause, let Q : ℓ1(Ξ) → ℓ1(Ξ)/S(S) be the quotient map. Proposi-
tion 2.2 implies that QS is bounded, so it will suﬃce to show that the range of QS is
dense in ℓ1(Ξ)/S(S). Let ε > 0. Each element y ∈ ℓ1(Ξ)/S(S) has the form y = Qf for
some f ∈ ℓ1(Ξ). Take a ﬁnite subset Υ of Ξ such that kf − Pξ∈Υ f (ξ)eξk 6 ε, and set
z = Pξ∈Υ f (ξ)ξ ∈ Z. Then we have

from which the conclusion follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.8. Let Z be an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space which contains no subspace
isomorphic to ℓ1. Combining Rosenthal’s ℓ1-theorem with the Schur property of ℓ1, we
deduce that every bounded, linear map from Z into ℓ1 is compact, and hence the hypothesis
of Lemma 2.7 is satisﬁed.

We note in passing that the converse of this statement is not true.

Indeed, the Ba-
nach space ℓ∞ contains a subspace which is (isometrically) isomorphic to ℓ1, and every
bounded, linear map T : ℓ∞ → ℓ1 is compact. To verify the latter fact, we observe that
each such map T is weakly compact by a theorem of Pełczyński [8] because no subspace
of its codomain is isomorphic to c0. Using once more that ℓ1 has the Schur property, we
conclude that T is compact.

Corollary 2.9. Let A be an inﬁnite-dimensional, separable Banach algebra with the trivial
product, and suppose that every bounded, linear map from A into ℓ1 is compact. Then A
has a singular, admissible extension which splits algebraically, but not strongly.

Proof. Applying Lemma 2.7 with Z = A and taking X = ℓ1(Ξ), where Ξ is a normalized
Hamel basis for A , we obtain a linear map S : A → X such that the closed subspace
Y = S(S) of X satisﬁes (S + T )[A ] 6⊆ Y for each bounded, linear map T : A → X, and

A SINGULAR, ADMISSIBLE EXTENSION WHICH SPLITS ALGEBRAICALLY, NOT STRONGLY 9

the quotient space X/Y is separable. Hence X/Y embeds into ℓ∞, and thus into ℓ∞(N, Y ),
and the conclusion follows from Corollary 2.6.
(cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Our strategy is to apply Proposition 2.3 with B = B(ER), C = ℓ∼
2 ,
and β = ψ, using the notation of Theorem 1.2. By (1.3), we have an extension of the
form (2.4) which splits strongly.

The Schur property of ℓ1 implies that every bounded, linear map from ℓ2 into ℓ1 is

compact, so by Corollary 2.9, we obtain a singular, admissible extension of ℓ2

(2.14)

which splits algebraically, but not strongly. Passing to the unitizations, and writing A for
the unitization of the Banach algebra E (so that A = E ⊕ K1, with the product and norm
deﬁned in the usual way), we obtain an extension of the form (2.3) of C = ℓ∼

2 , where

α(a + s1) = α0(a) + s1

(a ∈ E , s ∈ K),

and this extension clearly inherits the properties of (2.14), so that it is singular and admis-
sible and splits algebraically, but it does not split strongly. Thus Proposition 2.3 produces
an extension (2.5) of B = B(ER) which is singular and admissible and splits algebraically,
but it does not split strongly. To complete the proof, we note that the algebra D in (2.5)
is unital because the algebras A , B, and C in (2.3) and (2.4) are unital, and hence so are
the surjections α and β.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.10. The Banach space EDLW constructed by Dales, Loy, and Willis [3] provides
an interesting contrast to Read’s space ER, especially in relation to Theorem 1.1. Indeed,
EDLW shares with ER the property that B(EDLW) admits a discontinuous algebra homo-
morphism into a Banach algebra (under the assumption of the Continuum Hypothesis), but
it diﬀers in that every derivation from B(EDLW) into a Banach B(EDLW)-bimodule is con-
tinuous. Hence every singular, admissible extension of B(EDLW) which splits algebraically
also splits strongly by a general result that was stated in the Introduction.
