INTRODUCTION

The strong coupling αs is one of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM), setting the scale of the
strength of the strong interaction theoretically described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). At the reference Z
Z) = 0.1181 ± 0.0013 [1] as determined from diﬀerent experimental observ-
pole mass scale, its value amounts to αs(m2
ables confronted to perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy [2].
Given its current δαs/αs ≈ 1% uncertainty—orders of magnitude larger than that of the gravitational (δG/G ≈ 10−5),
Fermi (δGF/GF ≈ 10−7), and QED (δα/α ≈ 10−10) couplings—the strong coupling is the least precisely known of all
interaction strengths in nature. Improving our knowledge of αs is a prerequisite to reduce the theoretical uncertainties
in the calculations of all high-precision pQCD processes whose cross sections or decay rates depend on higher-order
powers of αs, as is the case for virtually all those measured at the LHC. In the Higgs sector, in particular, the αs
uncertainty is currently the second major contributor (after the bottom mass) to the parametric uncertainties of the
calculations of its prevalent H→ bb decay, the leading one for the H→ c¯c, gg modes [3], and it also introduces a
3.7% uncertainty on theoretical NNLO cross sections for the (dominant) Higgs production channel via gluon-gluon
fusion [2].

The hadronic decay widths of the electroweak bosons, ΓW,Z

(N3LO), i.e. O(cid:16)

had , are high-precision theoretical and experimental
observables from which an accurate determination of αs can be obtained. On the one hand, the hadronic Z width
–measured with 0.1% experimental uncertainty in e+e− collisions, and theoretically known up to next-to-NNLO
QCD corrections– provides, combined with other Z-pole observables, a powerful constraint on the
current αs world-average [4]. On the other hand, the hadronic W width has not been used so far in any αs extraction.
The reasons for that are twofold. First, the ΓW
had experimental uncertainties –of order 2%, or 0.4% in the case of the
BW
had ≡ ΓW
had/ΓW
had, whereas the αs sensitivity
of the W and Z hadronic decays comes only through small higher-order (loop) corrections. Secondly, a complete
(cid:17)
expression of ΓW
had including all computed higher-order terms was lacking until recently. This situation changed with
had including so-far missing mixed QCD+electroweak O (αsα) corrections, improving
the work of [5] that obtained ΓW

,
s
[10] QCD corrections. Despite the progress, the work of [5] still contains
a range of approximations (such as e.g. one-loop αs running between mW and mZ, and massless quarks), plus no real
estimation of the associated uncertainties, which hinder its use to extract αs from a comparison to the data.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, by improving upon the N3LO theoretical derivation of the W hadronic
width, removing various of the approximations applied in previous works, and by combining it with the total W decay
width known at NNLO accuracy [11, 12], we obtain a theoretical expression of the hadronic W branching ratio with a
sound determination of all associated uncertainties. We then compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental
data, and thereby determine αs. Secondly, since the hadronic decay width is directly proportional to the sum over the
u,c,d,s,b |Vi,j|2 (the top quark is kinematically forbidden in W decays), we can
also extract –by ﬁxing now αs to its current world average– a precise independent value of the charm-strange quark
mixing CKM element |Vcs|, which currently has an experimental uncertainty of 1.6% (|Vcs,exp| = 0.986 ± 0.016) [1].
We demonstrate, at the same time, that the measurements of W decays provide today the most stringent test of CKM
matrix unitarity for all quarks lighter than the top quark. The developments presented here should motivate high-

quality measurements of W decays using the large datasets available at the LHC, as well as improve the αs extraction
benchmarks expected from W measurements at future e+e− colliders such as ILC [13] and FCC-ee [14].

The hadronic decay width of the W boson can be decomposed into the following contributions:

where Γ(0) denotes the Born decay width, O(αi

of order O(α), and Γmixed the mixed electroweak+QCD corrections of order O(ααs). In the massless quark limit, the
zeroth-order decay width reads

where Nc = 3 is the number of colours, GF is the Fermi constant, mW is the W boson mass, and |Vi,j| the CKM matrix

electroweak and mixed terms were obtained setting the CKM matrix to unity. Since Γ(0) + Γ(1)
QCD numerically amount
to ∼100% of ΓW
had, a ﬁrst improvement over [5] consists in computing the exact results for the Born width and the ﬁrst
QCD correction using ﬁnite quark masses, rather than through the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients of R. In our calculations, we
thus replace Eq. (2) with the exact expression for the decay width with full quark masses mq,i [16], namely

matches numerically the result of Eq. (2) in the limit mq,i, mq(cid:48),j → 0, as well as the exact leading order calculation
of [6]. For the remaining higher-order QCD corrections, starting from O(α2
s ), we use the coeﬃcients given by Eq. (5),
while the electroweak and mixed corrections are those computed in [5]. Since the main motivation of the analysis is to
obtain a precise value of αs, a second direct improvement with respect to the LO αs expression used in [5] is achieved
by evaluating αs at the relevant scales here (mW and mZ) including up to three-loops (i.e. NNLO) in the renormalization
group β function [17]. Also, for our numerical evaluations we use the latest values of the SM parameters with their

TABLE I: Numerical values (in MeV) of the partial and total hadronic W decay widths computed at N3LO in this work, using
the experimental CKM matrix (top row) or imposing CKM unitarity (middle row), including associated parametric and theoretical
uncertainties. The last row shows, for comparison, the previous results of [5].

The W hadronic widths listed in the last column of Table I, include two type of uncertainties. The ﬁrst “parametric”
one, clearly dominant, is associated with the uncertainties of the various input parameters used in the calculations
(mostly |Vcs|, mW, and αs). The second “theoretical” one is due to uncertainties mostly from missing higher-order
corrections. The parametric uncertainties have been determined as follows. For each parameter p = |Vi,j|, mW , αs, ...
we have calculated the decay width for p, p + ∆p and p − ∆p, while all other parameters are kept ﬁxed at their central
values. The error on the width is then determined by

The total parametric errors have been obtained by adding in quadrature the parametric errors from the N parameter
variations. The dominant parametric uncertainty is due to the |Vcs| quark coupling strength, whose relative uncertainty
of 1.6% [1] propagates into ±22 MeV in ΓW
had. If one assumes CKM unitarity (or, equivalently, negligible |Vij| uncer-
tainties) the second most important source of parametric uncertainty is that from mW which propagates into ±0.7 MeV
in ΓW
had (second row of Table I). The theoretical uncertainties of our calculations are clearly much smaller than the
parametric ones. They are obtained from the quadratic sum of missing higher-order QCD corrections, considered to
be of the same size, ±0.019 MeV, as the O(α5
s) corrections assessed for the hadronic Z boson width [10]; and missing
higher-order electroweak and electroweak+QCD terms estimated to be ±0.012 MeV and ±0.029 MeV based on [5].

The W hadronic branching fraction, given by the ratio of hadronic to all W decays, is a very simple and robust

IV. EXTRACTION OF αs

The theoretical dependencies on αs of the hadronic W decay width and branching fraction are shown in Fig. 2
imposing CKM unitarity (solid curves) or using the experimental values of the CKM elements (dashed curves). The
vertical lines indicate the current experimental values for both quantities while the grey bands indicate their associated
uncertainties. Fixing all SM parameters except αs to their PDG values, and equating the theoretical expressions for
had(αs) and BW
ΓW
had(αs) to their corresponding experimental measurements, the strong coupling can be extracted. The
corresponding results are listed in the top rows of Table II, where the obtained αs(m2
W) values (second column) are
evolved to the Z scale (last column) with the NNLO running coupling expression. As expected, the much larger
had (±0.4%) results in a more precise αs extraction from the latter. Yet, the
uncertainty of ΓW
current experimental and parametric uncertainties on ΓW
had propagate into very large αs uncertainties in both
cases. Clearly, those results call ﬁrst for higher precision measurements of ΓW
had. Indicatively, for each MeV of
reduced uncertainty on ΓW
had,exp the precision of the extracted αs value would improve by approximately 2%. Secondly,
a competitive extraction of αs requires also a reduction of the parametric uncertainties of the calculations. The impact

V. EXTRACTION OF |Vcs|, AND CKM MATRIX UNITARITY TEST

had and BW

The hadronic W width, Eq. (6), involves a sum over the ﬁrst two rows of the CKM matrix, i.e. the six CKM ele-
ments involving quarks lighter than mW listed in (8). Among these, the |Vud| and |Vcs| terms are the most important in W
hadronic decays and, as shown previously, the least precisely known (|Vcs|) contributes to the largest uncertainty in the
calculation of ΓW
had. From the theoretical expressions and the experimental values of the hadronic width and
branching ratio, ﬁxing all SM parameters to their world-averages except |Vcs|, we can extract the charm-strange mixing
parameter. The corresponding results are listed in the middle column of Table III. The associated experimental, para-
metric, and theoretical |Vcs| uncertainties are propagated as explained before, for the αs determination. The ΓW
had,exp and
BW
had,exp uncertainties propagate into ±2% and ±0.4% respectively, the parametric uncertainties are of order ±0.2%, and
the theoretical ones are negligible (±0.0004th) and not quoted. Our most precise extraction, combining hadronic and
fact, the W decays provide the most stringent test of CKM unitarity today. Indeed, leaving free the sum(cid:80)
leptonic branching ratios results, yields |Vcs| = 0.973±0.003exp±0.001par, i.e. with a 0.3% uncertainty, improving by a
factor of ﬁve the precision of the current world-average experimental value, |Vcs,exp| = 0.986±0.016 [1]. As a matter of

VI. FUTURE PROSPECTS

A precise determination of the strong coupling, as well as stringent SM tests such as CKM unitarity, require
measurements of W decays of higher precision than those available today. The total W width has been directly
measured via maximum-likelihood ﬁts of (i) the Breit-Wigner W mass distribution in e+e− → W+W−, yielding

thanks to the much higher statistics available in measurements of the large-mT((cid:96)ν) spectra, and the better knowledge
of the parton distributions functions, which constitute today the leading source of systematic uncertainty [21]. Com-
bining thereby all results from W hadronic and leptonic decays can reduce the propagated experimental uncertainty on
the αs extraction to the 10% level. In e+e− → W+W− at the FCC-ee, the total W width ΓW

We have also quantiﬁed the constraints that the hadronic W decays impose on the quark mixing parameters as
