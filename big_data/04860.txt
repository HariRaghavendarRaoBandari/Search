ABSTRACT
We use the published photometry and spectroscopy of 22 galaxies in the Herschel
Reference Survey to determine that the value of the dust mass absorption coeﬃcient
−0.026 m2 kg−1. We do so by taking
κd at a wavelength of 500 µm is κ500 = 0.051+0.070
advantage of the fact that the dust-to-metals ratio in the interstellar medium of
galaxies appears to be constant. We argue that our value for κd supersedes that of
James et al. (2002) – who pioneered this approach for determining κd – because we
take advantage of superior data, and account for a number of signiﬁcant systematic
eﬀects that they did not consider. We comprehensively incorporate all methodological
and observational contributions to establish the uncertainty on our value, which
represents a marked improvement on the oft-quoted ‘order-of-magnitude’ uncertainty
on κd. We ﬁnd no evidence that the value of κd diﬀers signiﬁcantly between galaxies,
or that it correlates with any other measured or derived galaxy properties. We
note, however, that the availability of data limits our sample to relatively massive
O
(109.7 < M(cid:63) < 1011.0 M(cid:12)), high metallicity (8.61 < [12 + log10
H ] < 8.86) galaxies;
future work will allow us to investigate a wider range of systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

The study of cosmic dust has advanced enormously over
the past 10–15 years, with the advent of telescopes such as
Spitzer (Werner et al., 2004), Herschel (Pilbratt et al., 2010),
Planck (Planck Collaboration et al., 2011) and ALMA (the
Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array). Observa-
tions of dust emission in the Far-InfraRed (FIR) and submil-
limetre (submm) now serve as some of our most potent tools
for understanding the InterStellar Medium (ISM), providing
us with avenues to investigate galaxies’ chemical evolution,
star-formation, and interstellar environments.

However, our ability to use FIR and submm observa-
tions to actually measure the mass of dust in galaxies is
notoriously limited. The dust mass absorption coeﬃcient,
κd (sometimes called the dust mass opacity coeﬃcient), de-
scribes what mass of dust gives rise to an observed dust
luminosity. However, the value of κd is very poorly con-
strained, leading to correspondingly large uncertainty on
derived dust mass values. The value of κd is dictated by
the physical properties of the dust, such as the mass density
of the constituent materials, the eﬃciency with which they

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS

emit, the grain surface-to-volume ratio, and the grain size
distribution.

A wide range of values of κd have been estimated, using
a variety of techniques. Most require making assumptions
about the physical properties of dust grains. The raw mate-
rials that make up dust are actually quite well known; the
majority of the mass of dust consists of C, N O, Mg, Si, and
Fe. This is inferred from observations of the gas phase of
the ISM, which is found to be highly depleted of these ele-
ments (Savage & Sembach, 1996; Jenkins, 2009). Similarly,
some information about the grain size distribution can be
extracted from the UltraViolet (UV) dust extinction curve
(Kim et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1996; Gall et al., 2014). Hence
chemical considerations can be used to model the mineralog-
ical and physical properties of dust (Whittet, 1992; Jones,
2013). Numerous such models exist (eg, Hildebrand, 1983;
Draine & Lee, 1984; Draine & Li, 2007; Jones et al., 2013),
and each implies a corresponding value of κd; but there is
a great deal of variation between the characteristics of the
dust in these various models. Comparisons of FIR/submm
emission and UV/optical extinction in Galactic nebulæ can
be used to estimate κd (Casey, 1991; Bianchi et al., 2003),

2

but require assumptions about the cloud geometry, and the
results may not apply beyond the nebulæ in question, given
the known variation of dust properties with environment
(Cardelli et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2012b; Planck Collabora-
tion et al., 2014a,b). A similar approach can be taken with
entire nearby galaxies (Alton et al., 2000, 2004; Dasyra et al.,
2005), but this likewise requires assumptions about the ge-
ometry and radiative transfer properties of the dust, in order
to constrain the optical depth. Laboratory examination of
dust analogues, informed by the composition of pre-solar
dust grains, provides an alternate approach for determining
κd (Mutschke, 2013; Demyk et al., 2013). However only a
small number of truly pre-solar dust grains have been re-
trieved for analysis (Messenger et al., 2013), so it is hard to
establish the relative importance in the bulk composition of
interstellar dust of the particular materials being studied in
the laboratory.

The values of κd suggested by these methods vary enor-
mously. See the summary tables in Alton et al. (2004) and
Demyk et al. (2013) for a range of observationally- and
experimentally-derived values. We can compare values of κd
determined at diﬀerent wavelengths using the relation:

(cid:18) λ0

(cid:19)β

κλ = κ0

λ

(1)

where κλ is the value of κd at some wavelength λ, κ0 is the
reference value of κd at some reference wavelength λ0, and
β is the dust emissivity spectral index.

The literature values of κd listed in the summary ta-
bles of Alton et al. (2004) and Demyk et al. (2013), along
with several other commonly-cited values (Draine, 2003;
Dasyra et al., 2005; Draine & Li, 2007; Eales et al., 2010;
Compi`egne et al., 2011), are plotted in Figure 1, converted1
to κ500 as per Equation 1 (only using values where λ0 ≥
250 µm, and assuming β = 2 as a basic approximation).
These 46 values have a standard deviation of 0.8 dex, and
span over 3.5 orders of magnitude in total, ranging from
κ500 = 0.031 m2 kg−1 to κ500 = 104 m2 kg−1.

This vast uncertainty in κd is extremely troubling, es-
pecially considering that the observed dust mass of a galaxy
is now being used as a proxy for estimating other quanti-
ties, such as the total gas mass (Eales et al., 2012; Scoville
et al., 2014). Modulo the uncertainty on the value of κd,
this promises to be a useful tool, particularly at high red-
shift where other gas estimators may not be available.

Ideally, in order to calibrate a robust value for κd, there
would be a way to a priori know the dust mass present
in a galaxy, without reference to FIR/submm observations.
Fortunately, James et al. (2002) demonstrated that this is,
in fact, possible. It has been 13 years since James et al. ﬁrst
applied their technique; with the advent of Herschel, and
the greatly improved quality of extragalactic observations
now available, the time is now ripe to repeat their analysis,
taking advantage of the the greatly improved resources at
our disposal.

In Section 2 we describe the James et al. method, and

depends upon temperature, with entries for both 300 K and 10 K,
the 10 K value has been taken.

Figure 1. Literature values of κ500, taken from the summary
tables of Alton et al. (2004) and Demyk et al. (2013), along with
several other widely-cited values (Draine, 2003; Dasyra et al.,
2005; Draine & Li, 2007; Eales et al., 2010; Compi`egne et al.,
2011), plotted against their year of publication. There is no in-
dication that reported values of κd are converging as time goes
by. Highlighted is the value of κd found by James et al., whose
method this work is based upon; Eales et al. (2010), who used
a resolved variant of the James et al. method for two galaxies;
and the very commonly-used values of Draine (2003) and Draine
& Li (2007). Also shown for later comparison is the value of κd
we determine in Section 5. The solid error bar shows the uncer-
tainty derived in Section 5.1, whilst the dotted error bar indicates
the potential extent of the systematic oﬀset due to the fact that
the absolute metallicity scale calibration is not known to better
than 0.7 dex (Kewley & Ellison, 2008, see Section 2). Note that
some of the scatter in this plot will be due to diﬀerences in the
metallicity prescriptions employed; we opt not to correct for this,
therefore keeping the plot representative of the absolute variation
in reported values of κd.

how we intend to apply it. In Section 3 we outline the Her-
schel Reference Survey, the sample we use to perform our
analysis. In Section 4 we describe how we ﬁt the dust SEDs
of the galaxies in our sample. In Section 5 we put the method
into practice, to arrive at a new, well-constrained value for
κd. In Section 6 we look at how our computed values for κd
vary across our sample. In Section 7 we compare our value
for κd to other reported values.

2 THE METHOD

The James et al. method for determining the value of κd
takes advantage of the fact that the fraction of the metals
in a galaxy’s ISM that are locked up in dust, εd, appears to
be constant. A wealth of evidence supports the notion that
εd is constant in the modern universe (Sodroski et al., 1997;
Dwek, 1998; Leroy et al., 2011; Watson, 2011; Smith et al.,
2012a; Corbelli et al., 2012), with further work suggesting
it is also constant at high redshift (Pei, 1992; Pei et al.,
1999; Zafar & Watson, 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Sparre et al.,
2014). There also exist theoretical frameworks to explain the
observed invariance in εd (Inoue, 2003; Asano et al., 2011;
Mattsson et al., 2014). It should however be noted that there
is conﬂict in the literature on the matter of whether or not

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??–??

1985199019952000200520102015Year10-210-1100101102κ500 (m2kg−1)Literature valuesJames et al. (2002)Draine et al. (2003,2007)Eales et al. (2010)This workεd remains constant in low-metallicity systems; some studies
ﬁnd that εd diﬀers in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (Gal-
liano et al., 2005; Hunt et al., 2005), whereas others have
found εd to be constant over a wide range of masses, metal-
licities, and redshifts (Pei, 1992; Zafar & Watson, 2013).

Many of the interstellar dust-to-metals ratios quoted in
the literature are not suitable for the purposes of this work.
Some quote the dust-to-metals ratio in terms of extinction
per column density of metals, AV /NHX (eg, Watson, 2011;
Zafar & Watson, 2013; Sparre et al., 2014), which cannot be
converted to a value of εd without assuming what column
density of dust corresponds to a given degree of extinction
– and given that the aim of this work is the determine the
dust mass-to-emission ratio, it would be unwise to predicate
it upon assumptions about the equally poorly-constrained
dust mass-to-extinction ratio. There are also works which
use an assumed value of κd to arrive at their value for εd (eg,
Smith et al., 2012a; Davies et al., 2014); as such, any attempt
to use these values to estimate κd would be an exercise in
circular logic.

Fortunately, there are numerous values of εd reported
in the literature which are suitable for the purposes of de-
termining κd, from studies which examine elemental deple-
tions to establish the fraction of metals locked up in dust
grains. The values we consider are 0.5 (Issa et al., 1990),
0.36 (Luck & Lambert, 1992, Large Magellanic Cloud),
0.46 (Luck & Lambert, 1992, Small Magellanic Cloud), 0.5
(Whittet, 1992), 0.51 (Pei, 1992) 0.36 (Meyer et al., 1998),
0.3 (Dwek, 1998), 0.45 (Pei et al., 1999), 0.529 (Weingartner
& Draine, 2001), 0.456 (James et al., 2002), 0.549 (Kimura
et al., 2003), and 0.387 (Draine et al., 2007). The average
(mean, median, and mode) of these 12 values is 0.5, and the
standard deviation is 0.1; hence we adopt a value for the
interstellar dust-to-metals ratio of εd = 0.5 ± 0.1.

Using εd requires knowledge of the metallicity of a
galaxy’s ISM. Gas-phase metallicity is generally expressed in
terms of the logarithm of the oxygen-to-hydrogen bulk abun-
O
dance ratio, in the form [12 + log10
H ]; in such units, the So-
lar metallicity is 8.69 ± 0.05 (Asplund et al., 2009). Because
we are concerned with the absolute metal mass fraction, we
O
convert [12 + log10
H ] metallicites to metal mass fractions
by reference to the Solar values; we use a Solar metal mass
fraction of fZ(cid:12) = 0.0134 (Asplund et al., 20092, uncertainty
assumed to be negligible). This does entail the assumption

absolute metallicity, including those we use here. Because it
is a systematic, we do not incorporate it into our uncer-
tainty analysis in Section 5.1; rather, we stress to the reader
that there is some underlying ﬁxed oﬀset between the metal

corresponding true metal mass fractions, of up to 0.7 dex.

It is also important to note that [12+log10

O
H ] is a tracer
of gas-phase metallicity – whereas we are interested in the
metallicity of the entire ISM. When using gas-phase oxygen
abundance to determine ISM metallicity, a correction needs
to be applied to account for the the fraction of oxygen de-
pleted onto dust grains. Speciﬁcally, this correction needs to
account for the oxygen depletion level in Hii regions, which
are the source of the majority of the nebular line emission
of star-forming galaxies (Kunth & ¨Ostlin, 2000), and hence
are where empirical gas-phase metallicity estimators are cal-
ibrated (including those used in this work, see Section 3). We
perform this correction using the Mesa-Delgado et al. (2009)
oxygen-depletion factor of δO = 1.32 ± 0.09, determined by
observing reductions in oxygen depletion due to dust de-
struction in shocked regions of Orion Nebula. This value is
in good agreement with the values of δO reported by Zurita
& Bresolin (2012) from comparisons of Hii regions and blue
supergiants in M 31, Patterson et al. (2012) and Kudritzki
et al. (2012) for M 81, and Peimbert & Peimbert (2010) for
galactic Hii regions. It should be noted that studies sug-
gests δO decreases in low-metallicity environments, with no
depletion observed by Bresolin et al. (2009) in NGC 0300

([12 + log10
& Peimbert (2010) in low-metallicity galaxy SBS 0335-052

E ([12 + log10
consider in this work have at least double these metallici-
O
ties ([12 + log10
H ] > 8.61, see Section 3), the value of δO we
adopt should be unaﬀected.

alone, and assume solar metallicity when doing so, equiva-
lent to using a correction factor of ξ = 1.36. However, this
ignores the mass contribution of metals, and the fact that
the helium fraction is metallicity-dependant; a galaxy with
zero metallicity would have ξ = 1.33, whilst ξ = 1.39 at
solar metallicity.

The mass of atomic hydrogen (in Solar masses) in a
galaxy is determined from 21 cm observations using the stan-
dard prescription:

The mass of molecular hydrogen in a galaxy (in So-
lar masses) is typically inferred from the luminosity of the

(7)

where SCO is the integrated ﬂux density of the 12C16O(1-
0) line in Jy km s−1, D is the source distance in Mpc, and
αCO is the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in M(cid:12) K−1 km−1 s.
We opt to use the metallicity-dependant αCO prescription
of Schruba et al. (2012), which takes the form:

where A and N are empirical calibration constants deter-
mined by Schruba et al. (2012) with values A = 8.0 ± 1.3
and N = −2.0 ± 0.4. Schruba et al. (2012) calibrated this
prescription empirically over a 1 dex range in metallicity
O
(8 < [12 + log10
H ] < 9), encompassing the full metallicity
range of the galaxies we consider in this work (see Section 3),
and ﬁnd 0.1 dex of scatter on the prescription as a whole.
Note that for the metallicity range of of the galaxies we con-
sider in this work (see Section 3), the Schruba et al. (2012)
prescription is compatible with the alternative metallicity-
dependant prescription of Genzel et al. (2012).

We include the ξ term in Equation 8 to account for the
fact that the Schruba et al. (2012) prescription is calibrated
using the rate at which star-forming material is consumed,
and hence includes the mass of helium (and other elements)
associated with the molecular hydrogen being traced by the
CO (A. K. Leroy, priv. comm.) – whereas we are only con-
cerned with the mass of molecular hydrogen.

The FIR–submm (50 < λ < 1000 µm) emission from
dust in a galaxy is described by a two-component modi-
ﬁed blackbody Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), which
takes the form:

Md =

Sλw D2

κλ Bλ(Tw)

+

Sλc D2

κλ Bλ(Tc)

(9)

where Sλw and Sλc are the ﬂux densities of the warm and
cold dust components at wavelength λ in W Hz −1 m−2, and

Bλ(Tw) and Bλ(Tc) are each the Planck function at wave-
length λ and characteristic dust temperatures Tw and Tc.
Whilst a single-component modiﬁed blackbody would be a
simpler model, recent work has shown that this approach
can systematically fail to ﬁt the SEDs of certain galaxies;
we expand upon this, and detail how our SED ﬁtting is per-
formed, in Section 4.

Substituting Equation 4 into Equation 2, setting that
equal to Equation 9, and re-arranging to make κλ the sub-
ject, gives us the formula:

κλ =

D2

ξ (MHI + MH2 ) εd fZ(cid:12) Z

Bλ(Tw)

+

Sλc

Bλ(Tc)

(10)

(cid:18) Sλw

(cid:19)

which can be used to empirically determine the value of κd
for any galaxy for which FIR–submm photometry, atomic
gas mass, molecular gas mass, and integrated gas-phase
metallicity is available. Note that the resulting value of κd is
not aﬀected by uncertainty in source distance, because the
terms for both MHI and MH2 are proportional to D2; as
such D2 ultimately cancels out of Equation 10.

Whilst the method we have laid out here follows the
same basic principle as that of James et al., we note that
they did not explicitly account for the mass helium or met-
als when considering their ISM masses, whereas we do so
by including the ξ term in Equation 4; the metallicites of
the galaxies we consider in this work (see Section 3) give a
median value of ξ = 1.41, and hence our ultimate value of
κd will also be reduced by a factor of 1.41 (see Equation 10).
Nor did the James et al. method appear to account for the
depletion of oxygen onto dust, despite the fact that they
used measurements of gas-phase oxygen abundance, pegged
to Solar values, to determine absolute metallicities; given
our adopted correction of δO = 1.32, the factor by which
our values of κd will be reduced as a result of this consider-
ation will likewise be 1.32. Combined, ξ and δO will reduce
any value of κd by a factor of 1.86 – our inclusion of these
systematic eﬀects hence represents an essential development
of the James et al. technique.

3 THE SAMPLE

To perform our determination of κd, we use the rich, ho-
mogeneous dataset of the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS,
Boselli et al., 2010). The HRS consists of 323 galaxies in the
velocity range 1050 ≤ V ≤ 1750 km s−1 (with corrections
made to account for the velocity dispersion of the galaxies
of the Virgo Cluster), corresponding to a distance range of
15 ≤ D ≤ 25 Mpc. The HRS galaxies were selected on the
basis of their KS-band brightness, as this is the part of the
stellar emission spectrum that suﬀers least from extinction,
and is known to be a good proxy for stellar mass. The ap-
parent magnitude limit of the late type galaxies in HRS is
KS ≤ 12, which equates to an absolute magnitude limit in
the range −17.43 ≤ KS ≤ −18.54, depending on the dis-
tance of the source between the HRS limits. For early type
galaxies, a brighter apparent magnitude limit of KS ≤ 8.7
is applied.

The HRS has excellent multiwavelength photometric

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??–??

data available. The Herschel-SPIRE3 photometry is pre-
sented in Ciesla et al. (2012), Herschel-PACS4 photometry
in Cortese et al. (2014), WISE5 photometry in Ciesla et al.
(2014), and SDSS6 and GALEX7 photometry in Cortese
et al. (2012a) (note that not all of this photometry is used in
our determination of κd; the SDSS and GALEX data is used
in Section 6, when comparing κd to other galaxy properties).
Drift-scan spectroscopy of the HRS galaxies is presented
in Boselli et al. (2013); this data is in turn used by Hughes
et al. (2013) to determine integrated gas-phase metallicities,
normalised for direct comparison as per the prescriptions of
Kewley & Ellison (2008). Boselli et al. (2014) present 21 cm
atomic hydrogen observations and 12C16O(1-0) molecular
gas observations. We note that most of the CO observations
in Boselli et al. (2014) are single-dish central pointings, with
only partial coverage of the target galaxies (they infer the to-
tal CO emission assuming exponential molecular gas discs);
they do, however, present and homogenise literature CO ob-
servations that fully map HRS galaxies.

To use Equation 10, we need FIR–submm photome-
try (with which to ﬁt the dust SED), 21 cm measurements,
12C16O(1-0) measurements, and gas-phase metallicities – all
integrated over the entire target galaxy. In total, 22 HRS
galaxies have this complete range of data available; these
are the galaxies we use in Section 5 when determining the
value of κd. These 22 galaxies span a stellar mass range
of 109.7 < M(cid:63) < 1011.0 M(cid:12), and a metallicity range of
8.61 < [12 + log10

O
H ] < 8.86.

This dataset represents an enormous improvement over
what was available to James et al. for their original deter-
mination of κd. In particular, the Herschel photometry of
the HRS galaxies allows for far better SED ﬁtting than was
possible with the IRAS8 12–100 µm and JCMT SCUBA9
850 µm data that James et al. had at their disposal. Sim-
ilarly, the metallicities used by James et al. were not inte-
grated measurements of the kind available for the HRS, but
instead were derived from observations of a few individual
Hii regions only, and pre-date the metallicity-normalisation
procedure of Kewley & Ellison (2008).

The basic properties of the galaxies in our sample are
given in Table B1, and the gas masses and metallicities are
given in Table B3

We opt to use 500 µm as our reference wavelength for de-
termining κd, as it is a common choice in the literature (al-
lowing for easy comparison), and because it is the longest
Herschel wavelength, and hence the least aﬀected by dust
temperature.

For each source, we determine S500c , S500w , Tc, and

An Empirical Determination of κd

Tw, by ﬁtting a two-component modiﬁed blackbody model
to the dust SED from 60–500 µm, using a χ2-minimising
routine which incorporates the colour-corrections for ﬁlter
response function and beam area10,11,12,13. Note that for a
galaxy with an SED that is well-ﬁt by a single-component
model, this method is free to assign negligible mass to one of
the dust components, or ﬁt two identical-temperature com-
ponents. We use the 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 µm ﬂuxes
published by the HRS14, whilst at 60 µm we use IRAS pho-
tometry obtained using the Scan Processing and Integra-
tion Tool (SCANPI15), following the procedure laid out by
Sanders et al. (2003). Note that this photometry is all at suf-
ﬁciently long wavelengths that it will be unaﬀected by Poly-
cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, which occurs
at wavelengths (cid:47) 20µm (Draine & Li, 2007; da Cunha et al.,
2008). We also use the 22 µm ﬂuxes published by the HRS
as upper limits, to prevent unconstrained warm components
from being ﬁtted.

When modelling FIR–submm SEDs, there is a well-
established degeneracy between temperature and β (Shetty
et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013), that leads to an artiﬁcial
anticorrelation. To confuse matters further, methods that
should be ‘immune’ to the temperature-β degeneracy give
conﬂicting results regarding the actual variation of β with
temperature; the hierarchical Bayesian ﬁtting approach of
Kelly et al. (2012) indicates that temperature and β are pos-
itively correlated, whilst the laboratory analysis of Demyk
et al. (2013) suggests that there is in fact a real, underlying
temperature-β anticorrelation. For these reasons, we opt to
employ a ﬁxed β in this work; speciﬁcally, we use a value of
β = 2, as both observational (Dunne & Eales, 2001; Clemens
et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Planck Collaboration et al.,
2014b) and experimental (Demyk et al., 2013) evidence sug-
gests that values in the range 1.8–2.0 are appropriate for
nearby galaxies. Recent work has shown that when keeping
β ﬁxed, a single-component modiﬁed blackbody SED can
systematically fail to ﬁt the dust emission of galaxies (par-
ticularly in the case of late types), whilst a two-component
model works well (Clark et al., 2015); hence this is the model
we use (moreover, R´emy-Ruyer et al., 2015 have shown that
the single-component modiﬁed blackbody approach can sys-
tematically fail even when β is left free to vary). Fixing β
does, however, artiﬁcially reduce the uncertainty in SED ﬁts;
we address this in Section 5.1.

The SEDs are shown in Figure B1. The best-ﬁt values

for each parameter are given in Table B2.

5 DETERMINING THE DUST MASS

ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

We now have the values necessary to use Equation 10
to determine κ500 for each of the galaxies in our sam-
ple; the resulting values are listed in Table 1. The val-
ues range from κ500 = 0.031 m2 kg−1 (for NGC 4567), to
κ500 = 0.071 m2 kg−1 (for M 88). The median value is
κ500 = 0.051 m2 kg−1.

5.1 Uncertainties

To determine the uncertainty on the value of κ500 for each
galaxy in our sample, we employ a Monte Carlo bootstrap-
ping analysis, whereby the parameters in Equations 3, 5, 6,
7, 8, and 10 were re-sampled, and the value of κ500 was re-
calculated; this process was repeated 50,000 times for each
source.

Figure 2. The distributions of values of κ500 produced by boot-
strapping Equations 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, for each of the galaxies in
our sample. The actual value of κ500 determined for each galaxy
is indicated by the solid black line. We deﬁne the uncertainties
on each value by the 66. ˙6th percentiles away from the determined
value along the bootstrapped distributions (in each direction);
these are indicated by the dotted black lines.

−0.036 m2 kg−1. This is
fore, gives a κd value of κ500 = 0.071+0.096
well within the uncertainty of the value produced using the
metallicity-dependant αCO .

6 VARIATION IN κd

We now examine whether κd correlates with any of the prop-
erties of the galaxies in our sample. The properties we con-
sider are: M(cid:63) (stellar mass), Md, Md/M(cid:63), Tc, LTIR (total
infrared luminosity), MHI , MH2 , MHI /M(cid:63), MHI /MH2 , SFR
(star formation rate), SFR/M(cid:63), Z, D25 (the angular diam-
eter at the 25th magnitude per square arcsecond isophote),
and LTIR/LFUV (a proxy for FUV dust attenuation). The
values of M(cid:63), LTIR, SFR, D25 and LFUV are the same as
used in Section 5.1.1 of Clark et al. (2015).

In turn, we plotted the κ500 values of the galaxies in
our sample against each of the parameters in question, and
found the best-ﬁt straight line, using a χ2-minimisation ap-
proach. We then bootstrapped these ﬁts 1000 times each,
randomly perturbing the value of κ500 for every galaxy, ac-
cording to the distributions shown in Figure 2. The results
are compatible with there being no correlation of κ500 with
any of the parameters considered. Similarly, for each rela-
tionship, Spearman rank correlation tests do not allow us to
reject the null hypothesis (of there being no correlation) to
a likelihood of < 0.01. We note, however, that the size of our
sample is small compared to the scale of the uncertainties
on κ500; hence we in no way rule out that such correlations
could exist, but not be detectable in our data.

7 COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS ESTIMATES

As can be seen in Figure 1, our determined value of κd is
low compared to existing literature values (although the very
commonly-used values of Draine, 2003 and Draine & Li, 2007
are within our bootstrapped uncertainty). Converting the
James et al. value to a wavelength of 500 µm for comparison
with our own, as per Equation 1, translates it to κ500 =
0.20 ± 0.06 m2 kg−1; a factor of 3.92 larger than our value,
despite the fact we employ the same fundamental technique;
it is important to address the reasons for this.

As discussed in Section 2, our consideration of system-
atic eﬀects, using ξ (ie, the contribution of helium and metals
to a galaxy’s gas mass) and δO (ie, oxygen-depletion in Hii
regions) will account for a factor 1.86 reduction in κd rela-
tive to James et al.. We also employ a slightly larger value
of εd (0.5 versus 0.456), leading to a further factor 1.10 re-
duction in κd. However, our use of a more modern, smaller
value of fZ(cid:12) (0.0134 versus 0.019) works in the opposite di-
rection, diminishing the reduction in κd by a factor of 0.71.
In combination, these global eﬀects correspond to a factor

ing all of the bootstrapped distributions in Figure 2. The median
determined value of κ500 is indicated by the solid black line. The
dotted black lines indicate the uncertainties on this value, deﬁned
by the 66. ˙6th percentiles away from the median value along the
bootstrapped distribution (in each direction). Also plotted, for
comparison, is a dashed black line indicating the alternate value

space. The uncertainties on SHI and SCO were taken to be
the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) noise values quoted in Boselli
et al. (2014). For sources for which Boselli et al. (2014) do
not give an RMS noise, we assume a ‘worst-case scenario’
detection with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 2.

The re-sampled values of Tc, Tw, S500c , and S500w were
produced by re-ﬁtting the SED for each bootstrapping it-
eration; the 22–500 µm ﬂuxes were randomly perturbed ac-
cording to a Gaussian distribution deﬁned by their uncer-
tainties, and a best ﬁt was then made to this re-sampled
SED. Whilst we had used a ﬁxed β = 2 when carrying out
the SED ﬁts to the actual measured ﬂuxes of each source,
we left β free when performing the bootstrapping; otherwise
our uncertainties would have been artiﬁcially small.

The distribution of bootstrapped values of κ500 for each
galaxy are shown in Figure 2. The distributions are generally
asymmetric, and as such we deﬁne our uncertainties asym-
metrically; speciﬁcally, by the 66. ˙6th percentile away from
the determined value along the bootstrapped distribution,
in each direction. The resulting values are given in Table 1
(also listed for each source is the approximately-equivalent
logarithmic uncertainty, in dex, deﬁned by the 66. ˙6th per-
centile away from the determined value in absolute terms).
The median value of κ500 = 0.051 m2 kg−1 is in agreement
with the values of all of the sources to within their individual
uncertainties, with the exception of NGC 4567.

To determine the uncertainty on the average value of
κ500, we merged the bootstrapped distributions of all 22
galaxies in our sample; the resulting combined distribution
is plotted in Figure 3. We use this distribution to deﬁne the
uncertainty on the median value of κ500, as before. With
these uncertainties, we therefore ﬁnd a value of the dust
mass absorption coeﬃcient κd at a wavelength of 500 µm of

1.42 reduction in κd relative to James et al.; additional ef-
fects must be at work to explain the full diﬀerence between
our values.

Fortunately, M 61 (NGC 4303) is present in both the
James et al. sample and our own, allowing for a direct
comparison of the reasons for the diﬀerence in values for
a speciﬁc case. For M 61, we ﬁnd that our result of κ500 =
0.039 m2 kg−1 (see Table 1) is a factor of 5.13 less than the
κ500 = 0.20 m2 kg−1 value that James et al. found for their
sample as a whole. James et al. did not work out values of
κd for individual sources, but do say that there is scatter
of a factor of 2 around their sample-wide relation, hence we
need to account for a factor of 5.31+5.13−2.57 diﬀerence between
our κd for M 61, and the James et al. sample-wide value. In
Appendix A, we work through each of the sources of diﬀer-
ence in our values of κd in the case of M 61, and ﬁnd that
a factor of 6.31 is to be expected, well within the predicted
range – highlighting the dramatic inﬂuence of considering
systematic eﬀects and utilising superior observations.

During the Herschel Science Demonstration Phase,
Eales et al. (2010) applied a resolved variant of the James
et al. method (where they pegged the dust mass surface
density to the gas mass surface density, assuming a ﬁxed
Schmidt-Kennicutt law and a Milky Way dust-to-gas ratio)
to observations of two of the ﬁrst HRS targets, M 99 and
M 100. Whilst their analysis was limited by the fact they
had Herschel observations of only these two galaxies, and
assumed an uncorrected solar metallicity, they noted that
once the HRS was complete it would represent an ideal
dataset for a full determination of κd. Converted to our
500 µm reference wavelength as per Equation 1, they found
κ500 = 0.027 m2 kg−1 for M 99, and κ500 = 0.031 m2 kg−1 for
M 100. These values are smaller than (although still within
the uncertainties of) the values we ﬁnd for these galaxies; in-
deed, as seen in Figure 1, these are the smallest of all values
of κd reported in the literature. The nature of the resolved
analysis employed by Eales et al. (2010) makes it diﬃcult
to directly compare our values; however, the fact that they
could only consider pixels with signiﬁcant detections of dust,
Hi, and CO, will have limited their analysis to regions with
higher ISM surface-density – regions which might therefore
have systematically diﬀerent dust properties.

In contrast to this, the reader should note that we are
using integrated, galaxy-wide values for all of our measure-
ments. This is relevant to the Hi component in particular,
as it is conceivable that the mass in an extended Hi disc
may not have a direct bearing upon the properties of the
dust and gas found within the inner disc. If so, we would
be overestimating the MHI term in Equation 10, and hence
ﬁnding an artiﬁcially small value of κd. However, we have
reasons to believe that this is unlikely to be signiﬁcantly
distorting our result. The work of M´enard et al. (2010) and
Smith et al. (submitted) indicate that a signiﬁcant fraction
of a galaxy’s dust mass is found outside the main stellar
disc (M´enard et al. infer from quasar reddening that half
the dust mass is found beyond the stellar discs of galax-
ies, whilst Smith et al. perform submm stacking of the HRS
galaxies and ﬁnd that 10% of galaxies’ dust mass lies out-
side the optical D25, following an exponential proﬁle). This
shouldn’t necessarily be surprising, given that the ISM in
the outer discs of massive spiral galaxies has been shown to
be metal-rich, even out to large optical radii (Werk et al.,

2011; Patterson et al., 2012). Furthermore, Dunne at al. (in
prep.) show that signiﬁcant masses of dust can reside in an
atomic-gas-dominated medium where there is only a mini-
mal molecular gas component. The HRS submm photome-
try of Ciesla et al. (2012) used large apertures, with sizes
1.4–3.3 times the optical D25 for the galaxies in our sam-
ple; as such, the (likely faint) emission from any extended
dust component will be incorporated into the submm ﬂuxes
we use. Similarly, given the observing strategy described by
(Boselli et al., 2013), the HRS drift-scan spectroscopy sam-
pled the region beyond the optical disc for 82 per cent of the
galaxies in our sample; in these cases, the metallicity of the
outer disc will hence have been sampled17 (in a luminosity-
weighted manner). Regardless, the galaxies of our sample do
not actually appear to posses signiﬁcantly-extended atomic
gas discs. Resolved 21 cm observations are available in the
literature for 59 per cent of our sample18, and for these ob-
jects the submm photometric apertures encircle an average
of 95 per cent of the detected 21 cm emission (with a mini-
mum of 88 per cent) – whist the optical D25 isophotes con-
tain an average of 80 per cent of the 21 cm emission. As such,
even in the unphysically extreme scenario where the atomic
gas beyond the optical D25 contains no dust at all, a value of
κd determined using our method would be underestimated
by no more than a factor of 1.2.

Directly comparing our value for κd to those determined
via other means is problematic. At the most fundamental
level our method is similar to many theoretical approaches,
in that the initial consideration is the fraction of metals de-
pleted into dust grains – indeed, our ﬁnal value of κd is com-
patible with that determined by Draine (2003) and Draine
& Li (2007), who work from that very premise. However,
beyond this ﬁrst step, it is very diﬃcult to compare an em-
pirical result such as ours to theoretical values that arise
from considerations of astrochemistry and complex Mie the-
ory calculations. Similar calculations go into estimates based
upon radiative transfer modelling, which additionally rely
upon assumptions about the optical properties and/or ge-
ometry of the dust being modelled, making them equally
troublesome to compare to. However, whilst these diﬀerences
make other values for κd impractical to compare to our own,
we argue that this renders them highly complementary.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We apply the method of James et al. (2002) to the rich,
homogeneous dataset of the HRS. This technique enables
us to determine the dust mass in a galaxy without needing
to use FIR–submm photometry; by relating this calculated
dust mass to the observed dust emission, we can empirically
ﬁnd the value of the dust mass absorption coeﬃcient, κd.
We ﬁnd a value of κd at a wavelength of 500 µm of
−0.026 m2 kg−1. The uncertainty on this value

was determined rigorously, by bootstrapping for every in-
put parameter, taking the uncertainty on the prescriptions
employed, and the individual measurements used.

Empirical determinations of κd, such as this, provide
a vital counterpoint to the development of theoretical dust
models, as there are precious few ways in which the proper-
ties of dust can be observationally determined.

We note that our value for κd is susceptible to an ad-
ditional systematic oﬀset of up to 0.7 dex, due to the uncer-
tainty in the absolute metallicity scale calibration (Kewley
& Ellison, 2008). However, even when the full worst-case
oﬀset of 0.7 dex is combined with the results of our boot-
strapping analysis, the combined uncertainty of ∼ 0.74 dex
is still less than the generally assumed ‘order-of-magnitude’
uncertainty on κd.

With a single exception, the values of κd we determine
for the galaxies in our sample agree to within their uncer-
tainties. Na¨ıvely speaking, one would expect this to be true
for only ∼ 66 per cent of the sample. This suggests that the
uncertainty values (the majority of which we take from the
literature, with the exception of those derived from our SED
ﬁts) incorporated into our bootstrapping analysis have, on
average, been overestimated by their respective authors.

We ﬁnd no evidence that κd varies as a function of any
of the properties of the galaxies in our sample. However, as
we opted to limit our sample to HRS galaxies that share the
full set of homogeneous integrated measurements required,
our sample consists only of relatively massive (109.7 < M(cid:63) <
1011.0 M(cid:12)), high metallicity (8.61 < [12+log10
O
H ] < 8.86) sys-
tems. To truly establish if (and how) the value of κd changes
between galaxies is vital for the ﬁeld – despite the huge ad-
vances in dust astrophysics over the past 10–15 years, we
still have little idea if and how the value of κd diﬀers be-
tween galaxies. But doing so requires homogeneous high-
quality data for a wider range of systems than are available
at present.

Fortunately,

such as CALIFA19, SAMI20,

large Integral Field Unit (IFU) spec-
troscopy surveys
and
MaNGA21 mean that integrated metallicity measurements
will soon be available for vastly greater numbers of galax-
ies. Similarly, statistically-large local-Universe CO surveys,
such as JINGLE22, are becoming more common. Once these
datasets become available, it will be possible to use the
method we employ here to constrain the value of κd for
galaxies with a far broader range of properties.

CASE OF M 61

As described in Sections 2 and 7, we ﬁnd that our calculated
values of κd should be expected to be smaller than those of
James et al. by a factor of 1.42, due to global eﬀects. Here
we describe in detail the further diﬀerences that should be
expected to arise in the useful case of M 61, which is in both
our sample, and that of James et al..

Whereas James et al. quote a metallicity of [12 +
H ] = 9.01 for M 61, taken from spectra of individual Hii
O
log10
regions33, we use a metallicity of [12 + log10
O
H ] = 8.67, de-
rived from integrated drift-scan spectroscopy (Hughes et al.,
2013; Boselli et al., 2013) – which should therefore be the
superior measurement. This diﬀerence in metallicity con-
tributes a further factor 2.19 to the reduction in our value in
κd relative to that of James et al.. However, the diﬀerence in
metallicity also gives us a smaller αCO , and hence gas mass,
by a factor of 0.71.

James et al. used a lower value of SCO for M 61 than we
do. Their value is is derived from a series of 7 pointings34
along the major axis of M 61, extrapolated to the rest of
the disc (rendering them unable to account for azimuthal
variation) – whereas the value of SCO we take from Boselli
et al. (2014) is derived from a mapping of all detected CO
emission, with no reliance upon extrapolation, and so is pre-
sumably a far more accurate value.

James et al. also quoted a much smaller Hi mass for
M 61 than the one we take from Boselli et al. (2014), leading
to an additional factor 2.19 diﬀerence in our expected value
of κd. Unfortunately we are unable to deﬁnitively address
the underlying reasons for this discrepancy, as James et al.
do not seem to provide a reference for the Hi mass they use.
We note however their Hi mass is the same as that given by
Magrini et al., 2011, who integrated over the Hi radial pro-
ﬁle produced by Skillman et al., 1996 out to 0.7 optical radii
(due to signal-to-noise constraints in their ancillary data).
However, it is unclear if James et al. intentionally chose an
Hi value that only extends out to some fraction of the op-
tical radius of M 61, as most of the Hi masses employed by
James et al. are those compiled by the Scuba Local Universe
Galaxy Survey (SLUGS, Dunne et al., 2000), whose 21 cm
values are point-source integrated measurements taken from
the literature. The Hi mass we take from Boselli et al. (2014)
comes from the 84.71 Jy ﬂux measured by the ALFALFA
survey (Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA, Giovanelli et al., 2005;
Haynes et al., 2011), which is in excellent agreement with
the 85.2 Jy ﬂux measured at the Westerbork Synthesis Ra-
dio Telescope by Popping & Braun (2011b), and the 85.1 Jy
ﬂux measured at the Parkes Radio Telescope by Popping &
Braun (2011a). As such, it seems that the measurement we
use is accurate; possibly simply a beneﬁt of more modern
observations.
M 61 also illustrates the eﬀect that superior data from
Herschel has on SED-ﬁtting. The ∼ 0.9 order-of-magnitude
gap in wavelength coverage suﬀered by James et al. between
the IRAS 100 µm and SCUBA 850 µm points means that

they had no coverage of the dust emission peak, making it
diﬃcult to constrain dust temperatures. As a result they
ﬁxed the temperature of their cold dust component to 20 K
when performing their SED ﬁtting. The general shapes of
their SED ﬁts are very diﬀerent from our own (compare
their Figure 2 to our Figure B1), with a much more promi-
nent warm component, clearly incompatible with the Her-
schel photometry. Whereas they ﬁnd that M 61 has a cold-
to-warm dust mass ratio of Mc/Mw = 83 (see their Table 2),
we ﬁnd Mc/Mw = 7, 500 (their sample median cold-to-warm
dust mass ratio is only 19, compared to our median of 2,310).
In the case of M 61, the net eﬀect is an increase in the value
of the section of Equation 10 that incorporates the SED pa-
rameters35, which decreases by a factor of 0.87 the expected
deviation between our value of κd and that of James et al..
Combining all of these eﬀects leads us to expect our
value of κd for M 61 should be a factor of 6.31 smaller than
that of James et al. (a factor of 1.41 from ξ, 1.32 from δO,
1.10 from εd, 0.71 from fZ(cid:12) , 2.19 from MHI , 1.47 from SCO ,
2.19 from Z, 0.71 from αCO , and 0.87 from SED-ﬁtting). The
individual eﬀects contributing to the overall diﬀerence are
all attributable to our consideration of systematic eﬀects, or
our use of superior observational measurements (for Hi, CO,
metallicity, and FIR-submm data).

Table B2. Dust properties of the HRS galaxies that we study in this work. The temperatures and 500 µm ﬂuxes of the cold and warm
dust components were determined by ﬁtting a two-component modiﬁed blackbody SED to the published HRS photometry, as detailed
in Section 4. Note that the quoted uncertainties are merely representative; when bootstrapping to ﬁnd the total uncertainty in κd, we
re-ﬁt a bootstrapped SED for every iteration (as described in Section 5).

Gas properties of the HRS galaxies that we study in this work. Hi and CO measurements taken from Boselli et al. (2014).
Gas-phase metallicity values taken from Hughes et al. (2013), which used the spectra of Boselli et al. (2013). Note that the metallicities
given in the Z column have been corrected for gas-phase oxygen depletion by a factor of δO = 1.32, as per Equation 3; as a result, they
represent ISM metallicities, not gas-phase metallicities.
