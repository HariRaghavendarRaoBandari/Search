Frame-dragging Eﬀect in Strong Gravity Regime

Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India

Chandrachur Chakraborty

Abstract

The exact frame-dragging (or Lense-Thirring (LT) precession) rates for Kerr, Kerr-Taub-NUT
(KTN) and Taub-NUT spacetimes have been derived. Remarkably, in the case of the ‘zero an-
gular momentum’ Taub-NUT spacetime, the frame-dragging eﬀect is shown not to vanish, when
considered for spinning test gyroscope. In the case of the interior of the pulsars, the exact frame-
dragging rate monotonically decreases from the center to the surface along the pole and but it
shows an ‘anomaly’ along the equator. Moving from the equator to the pole, it is observed that
this ‘anomaly’ disappears after crossing a critical angle. The ‘same’ anomaly can also be found
in the KTN spacetime. The resemblance of the anomalous LT precessions in the KTN spacetimes
and the spacetime of the pulsars could be used to identify a role of Taub-NUT solutions in the
astrophysical observations or equivalently, a signature of the existence of NUT charge in the pulsars.

Introduction

Stationary spacetimes with angular momentum (rotation) are known to exhibit an eﬀect called Lense-
Thirring (LT) precession whereby locally inertial frames are dragged along the rotating spacetime,
making any test gyroscope in such spacetimes precess with a certain frequency called the LT precession
frequency [1]. This frequency has been shown to decay as the inverse cube of the distance of the test
gyroscope from the source for large enough distances where curvature eﬀects are small, and known to
be proportional to the angular momentum of the source. The largest precession frequencies are thus
expected to be seen very close to the source (like the surface of a pulsar, or the horizon of a black
hole), as well as for spacetimes rotating very fast with large angular momenta.

Earlier analyses of the LT eﬀect [2] assume slowly rotating (r >> a, a is the Kerr parameter of
the rotating spacetime due to a compact object like a black hole) spacetime for the test gyroscope [3].
Thus, the rotating spacetime solution is usually approximated as a Schwarzschild spacetime, and the
eﬀect of rotation is conﬁned to a perturbative term added on to the Schwarzschild metric. This leads
to the standard result for LT precession frequency in the weak ﬁeld approximation, given by [2]

~ΩLT =

1
r3 [3( ~J .ˆr)ˆr − ~J]
In a recent work reported in ref.

(1)

where, ˆr is the unit vector along r direction.
[4], an alternative
approach based on solving the geodesic equations of the test gyroscope numerically, once again within
the weak gravitational ﬁeld approximation, is used to compute the frame-dragging eﬀect for galactic-
centre black holes.

In another very recent related work [5], Hackman and Lammerzahl have given an expression of
LT precession (orbital plane precession) valid up to ﬁrst order in the Kerr parameter a for a general
axially symmetric Plebanski-Demianski spacetime. This is obviously a good approximation for slowly-
rotating compact objects. The LT precession rate has also been derived [6] through solving the
geodesic equations for both Kerr and Kerr-de-Sitter spacetimes at the polar orbit but these results are
not applicable for orbits which lie in orbital planes other than the polar plane. We understand that
observations of precession due to locally inertial frame-dragging have so far focused on spacetimes
where the curvatures are small enough; e.g., the LT precession in the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld which
was probed recently by Gravity Probe B [7]. There has been so far no attempt to measure LT
precession eﬀects due to frame-dragging in strong gravity regimes.

Two motivating factors may be cited in support of such a contention. First of all, the near-horizon
physics of black holes and that of the outer layers of neutron stars emitting X-rays from their accretion
discs also might need to be reanalyzed in view of the nontrivial LT precession of test geodesics in their
vicinity. With upcoming X-ray observatories, as well as multi-wavelength strong gravity space probes
currently under construction, which envisage to make observations of possible frame-dragging eﬀects
in strong gravity situations in the near future, the need to go beyond the weak ﬁeld approximation is
paramount. A recent work by Stone and Loeb [8] has estimated the eﬀect of weak-ﬁeld LT precession
on accreting matter close to compact accreting objects. While there are claims that what has been
estimated in this work pertains more to orbital plane precession, rather than precession of a test
gyroscope (which remains the classic example of LT precession), it is obvious that in the vicinity
of the spacetime near the surface of pulsars (respectively, the horizons of black holes), the large LT
precession of test gyroscopes ought to manifest in changes in the predicted X-ray emission behaviour
originating from modiﬁcations in the behaviour of infalling timelike geodesics of accreting matter
particles due to the LT precession. Thus, there is suﬃcient theoretical motivation to compute LT
precession rates in the strong gravity regime, in a bid towards a prediction that future probes of the
inertial frame dragging eﬀect, in such a regime, may correlate with.

2 Exact LT precession frequency in stationary spacetime & its ap-

plications

The exact LT precession frequency of a test gyroscope in strongly curved stationary spacetimes,
analyzed within a ‘Copernican’ frame, is expressed as a co-vector given in terms of the timelike Killing
vector ﬁelds K of the stationary spacetime, as (in the notation of ref. [9])

˜Ω =

1
2K 2 ∗ ( ˜K ∧ d ˜K)

(2)

where, ˜K & ˜Ω denote the one-form dual to K & Ω, respectively. Note that ˜Ω vanishes if and only if
( ˜K ∧ d ˜K) = 0. This happens only for a static spacetime.
Using the coordinate basis form of K = ∂0, the co-vector components are easily seen to be Kµ =
gµ0. Thus, the vector ﬁeld corresponding to the LT precession co-vector can be expressed in coordinate
basis as

Ω =

1
2

ǫijl√−g (cid:20)g0i,j(cid:18)∂l −

g0l
g00

∂0(cid:19) −

g0i
g00

g00,j ∂l(cid:21)

(3)

The remarkable feature of the above equation (3) is that it is applicable to any arbitrary stationary
spacetime (irrespective of whether it is axisymmetric or not); it gives us the exact rate of LT precession
in such a spacetime. For instance, a ‘non-rotating’ Newman-Unti-Tamburino [10] (NUT) spacetime is
known to be spherically symmetric, but still has an angular momentum (dual or ‘magnetic’ mass [11]);
we use Eq.(3) to compute the LT precession frequency in this case as well. This result is rather general,
because, there is only one constraint on the spacetime : that it must be stationary, which is the only
necessary condition for the LT precession. The utility of this equation is that; if any metric (gµν )
contains all 10 (4 × 4) elements non-vanishing, it can be used to calculate the LT precession in that
spacetime. In this case, the precession rate depends only on non-zero g0µ(µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) components,
not on any other non-zero oﬀ-diagonal components of the metric. Thus, this equation also reveals
that the LT precession rate is completely determined by the metric components g0µ, and is quite
independent of the other components (in co-ordinate basis).

Now, we should discuss that why a stationary spacetime shows this frame-dragging eﬀect irrespec-
tive of whether it is axisymmetric or not. A spacetime is said to be stationary if it possesses a timelike
Killing vector ﬁeld ξa; further, a stationary spacetime is said to be static if there exists a spacelike
hypersurface Σ which is orthogonal to the orbits of the timelike isometry. By Frobenius’s theorem of
hypersurface orthogonality, we can write for a static spacetime,

ξ[a∇bξc] = 0

(4)

If ξa 6= 0 everywhere on Σ, then in a neighbourhood of Σ, every point will lie on a unique orbit
of ξa which passes through Σ. From the explicit form of a static metric, it can be seen that the
diﬀeomorphism deﬁned by t → −t (the map which takes each point on each Σt to the point with the
same spatial coordinates on Σ−t), is an isometry. The “time translation” symmetry, t → t + constant
is possessed by all stationary spacetimes. Static spacetimes on the other hand, possess an additional
symmetry, “time reﬂection” symmetry over and above the “time translation symmetry”. Physically,
the ﬁelds which are time translationally invariant can fail to be time reﬂection invariant if any type
of “rotational motion” is involved, since the time reﬂection will change the direction of rotation. For
example, a rotating ﬂuid ball may have a time-independent matter and velocity distribution, but is
unable to possess a time reﬂection symmetry [12]. In the case of stationary spacetimes, the failure of
the hypersurface orthogonality condition (Eq.4) implies that neighbouring orbits of ξa “twist” around
each other. The twisting of the orbits of ξa is the cause of that extra precession in stationary non-static
spacetimes.

2.1 Exact LT precession rate in Kerr spacetime

One can now use Eq. (3) to calculate the precession rate of a test gyroscope in a Kerr spacetime to
get the LT precession in a strong gravitational ﬁeld. In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, the Kerr metric
is written as,

ds2 = −(cid:18)1 −

where, a is Kerr parameter, deﬁned as a = J

Now, using Eq.(3) we can obtain the following expression of LT precession rate in Kerr spacetime [13]

ρ2 = r2 + a2 cos2 θ, ∆ = r2 − 2M r + a2.

This is the LT precession rate where no weak gravity approximation has been made. In slow-rotation
limit (r >> a), the Kerr metric is approximated as a Schwarzschild metric with the cross term
(gφtdφdt), that is

and Eq. (7) reduces to Eq. (1) which is quite well-known to us.

2.2 Exact LT precession rate in Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime

The Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime is geometrically a stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution of Ein-
stein equation with Kerr parameter (a) and NUT charge (n). If the NUT charge vanishes, the solution
reduces to the Kerr geometry. The metric of the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime is

ds2 = −

∆ = r2 − 2M r + a2 − n2, p2 = r2 + (n − a cos θ)2,
A = a sin2 θ + 2n cos θ, B = r2 + a2 + n2.

(9)

(10)

As the spacetime has an intrinsic angular momentum (due to the Kerr parameter a), we can expect
a non-zero frame-dragging eﬀect which cam be written as

where, ρ2 = r2 + a2 cos2 θ. In contrast to the Kerr spacetime, where the source of the LT precession is
the Kerr parameter a, the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime has an extra somewhat surprising feature : the
LT precession does not vanish even for vanishing Kerr parameter a = 0, so long as the NUT charge
n 6= 0. This means that though the orbital angular momentum (J) of this spacetime vanishes, the
spacetime does indeed exhibit an intrinsic spinlike angular momentum (at the classical level itself).
One can show that inertial frames are dragged along this orbitally non-rotating NUT spacetime with
the precession rate [13]

2.3 Exact LT precession rate inside the rotating neutron stars

The rotating equilibrium models considered in this paper are stationary and axisymmetric. Thus
we can write the metric inside the rotating neutron star as the following Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu
(KEH) [15] form:

ds2 = −eγ+σdt2 + e2α(dr2 + r2dθ2) + eγ−σr2 sin2 θ(dφ − ωdt)2

(13)

where γ, σ, α, ω are the functions of r and θ only. In the whole paper we have used the geometrized
unit (G = c = 1). We assume that the matter source is a perfect ﬂuid with a stress-energy tensor
given by

(14)
where ρ0 is the rest energy density, ρi is the internal energy density, P is the pressure and uµ is the
matter four velocity. We are further assuming that there is no meridional circulation of the matter so
that the four-velocity uµ is simply a linear combination of time and angular Killing vectors.

3 Conclusions & Outlook

In contrast to most calculations of the LT precession rate in the literature, which focus on the weak-
ﬁeld approximation, this article has discussed in some detail the problem of the exact LT precession
formula in any stationary spacetime and derived the exact LT precession formula for full Kerr, KTN
and other spacetimes. The weak-ﬁeld approximation of LT precession (Eq. 1) for the Kerr spacetime
has been then shown to emerge straightforwardly from our general formulation. Interestingly, we have
shown that in the non-rotating and spherically symmetric Taub-NUT spacetime the LT precession
does not vanish. Applying the general LT formula we have also obtained the exact frame-dragging
rate inside the rotating neutron stars. It is known to us that Lynden-Bell and Nouri-Zonoz [20] ﬁrst
highlighted about the observational possibilities for NUT charges or (gravito)magnetic monopoles and
they claimed that the signatures of such spacetime might be found in the spectra of supernovae,
quasars, or active galactic nuclei. In our case, the resemblance of the anomalous LT precessions in
the KTN spacetimes and the spacetime of the pulsars could be the indirect proof of the existence of

the NUT charge ((gravito)magnetic monopoles) inside the pulsars and we also suggest that such a
signature could be used to identify a role of Taub-NUT solutions in the astrophysical observations.

Though any strong gravity measurement has not been performed till now the analogue models of
black holes can oﬀer an alternative option of the indirect measurement of strong gravity LT eﬀect in
a comparatively accessible laboratory setup. We deduce precise estimate [21] of the angular velocity
of the precession of a test spin outside the ergoregion of a ﬂuid mechanical rotating dumb hole in
acoustic spacetimes. It is our hope that with present technological expertise in manipulating analogue
black holes, experimentalists will be able to successfully verify our estimate and hence, more impor-
tantly, the predicted strong gravity LT eﬀect. Accretion disk theory and the related astrophysical
phenomena have been investigated using Newtonian or post-Newtonian Gravity. The strong gravity
LT eﬀect has not been considered in those calculations. As the accretion disks extend to the vicinity
of black hole horizons associated with the very strong gravity regime, the eﬀect of the frame-dragging
may have to be taken into account. It will be interesting to investigate the changes to the standard
accretion disc theory that this inclusion might entail. The exact frame-dragging rates have already
been derived inside and outside of the rotating neutron stars by us. Now, it would be worth to study
the quasi-periodic-oscillations (QPOs) in the case of accreting pulsars.
