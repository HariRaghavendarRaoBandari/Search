Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this work, we propose
an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum currents. Our detection scheme
relies on initiating the system in an anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric
sites, and using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the probe the
currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of meta-
stability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive
to the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much
longer than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a 4-site model and an
archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown to be robust under a weak disorder.

Symmetries are a vital ingredient to many molecu-
lar systems and play an important role in their trans-
port properties [1, 2]. They lead to intriguing non-trivial
consequences like the existence of multiple steady states
[3, 4] and could help design smart devices [5, 6]. Despite
these advantages, the eﬀect of symmetries in the trans-
port properties of molecular systems have not been fully
explored. Several studies on symmetric systems have
explored the eﬀects of dephasing [7, 8] and interference
[9, 10].

A thorough knowledge of symmetries could lead to a
better understanding of molecular junctions that have
become promising candidates to build transport devices
[11, 12]. They have been in the limelight due to the siz-
able quantum eﬀects that have led to exciting eﬀects in
electronic [13, 14], heat [15, 16], and excitonic [17, 18]
transport. Despite the plethora of studies, transport
signatures that arise solely due to the inherent molec-
ular symmetry have not been put forward. These signa-
tures could help identify the symmetric sites within the
molecule thus providing a clear atomic picture of the sys-
tem of interest. Using these signatures, we could explore
molecular symmetry to design nanodevices with tunable
transport properties.

In this study we propose an eﬃcient approach to detect
symmetries in molecular junctions by measuring the exci-
tonic currents. The main idea relies on using a probe that
could act locally on each site [19] thus breaking the sym-
metry of the system. Therefore, by varying the position
of the probe and initiating the system in an appropriately
chosen initial condition we ﬁnd the excitonic currents
vary from zero (for symmetric system) to a ﬁnite non-zero
value (for systems with broken symmetry). The non-zero
currents exhibit a long quasi-stationary plateau akin to

a classical metastable state [20].
If there are multiple
symmetries present within a system, like in the case of
para-benzene, then the multiple symmetries can also be
distinguished due to the presence of a multi-exponential
decay in the current dynamics. The signatures we obtain
are exclusive to symmetric systems and are found to be
sensitive to the timescales of the system and the probe.
Thus, we provide a comprehensive detection scheme of
molecular symmetries and elucidate its dynamical eﬀects.

Results
Detecting symmetries. Symmetry detection forms the
ﬁrst crucial step to manipulate molecular junctions in or-
der to build novel nanodevices, such as thermal switches
[6]. One of the key properties of symmetric systems is the
presence of multiple steady states. These occur when
the reduced dynamics is conﬁned to an invariant sub-
space that is not disturbed by the dissipative leads (see
methods section for a general proof). Our proof shows
that when the interaction of the reduced system doesnt
perturb the system out of the invariant subspace, the
symmetries are preserved and reﬂected in the reduced
dynamics in the form of multiple steady states. In other
words irrespective of the coupling strength or the form of
the master equation that governs the reduced dynamics
a symmetric system will possess multiple steady states.
Detecting such symmetries is highly non-trivial, espe-
cially in experimental set-ups, and in this work we pro-
pose a scheme that would help achieve this objective and
provide robust signatures in the transient currents. Our
scheme consists of two steps:
i) Initiating the molecu-
lar system in a dark state and ii) Using a probe that
acts locally on the molecular sites to detect which sites
are symmetric. The probe when placed on diﬀerent sites
could break or preserve the symmetries of the system.
The symmetry breaking would produce a non-zero cur-
rent whereas when symmetries are preserved the current
would be zero (due to the dark state initial condition that

FIG. 1. Eﬀect of probe position on symmetry detection. Time evolution of the excitonic current in the 4-site model
with symmetric (panel a), antisymmetric (panel b), and canonical (panel c) initial conditions. The probe is positioned at sites
1 (black solid line) and 2 (green dashed-dotted line) for all panels. The black crosses and open green circles correspond to the
nonequilibrium steady state values of the excitonic currents. The steady state values for panel a and c are small but non-zero.
Note the diﬀerent time unit in panel (b) indicating a very slow relaxation from the antisymmetric initial condition. The closed
circles in panel (b) represent results for a weakly disordered system with disorder strength δ = 0.13meV. The currents are
averaged over 100 samples of uniformly distributed random disorder. When the probe is placed at site 1 (black closed circles)
the current is small but non-zero due to disorder induced symmetry breaking. The system parameters are: ε = −142.2meV and
h = −9.35meV. The lead and probe parameters are chosen as: TL = 330K, TR = 270K, T = 300K, Γ = 196GHz, γ = 19.6GHz,
ω0 = 78.55THz, and ωD = 1.96 THz.

belongs to an invariant subspace).

For perfectly symmetric systems the switching phe-
nomenon can be observed even in the steady state. But
perfect symmetry is diﬃcult to obtain in experimental
set-ups and most systems are subject to conformational
disorder. Even for a ‘close to’ symmetric system with a
weak disorder (either static or dephasing) there would be
a single unique steady state. Hence the steady-state cur-
rents will not switch depending on the probe position.
In this case the dynamical regime could provide essen-
tial signatures.
If the disorder is weak it would aﬀect
the dynamical currents on the longest timescale and thus
during the intermediate times we expect that a weakly
disordered system would mimic a perfectly symmetric
system.

The breaking of symmetries could also aﬀect the re-
laxation times and help unravel the multiplicity of the
steady-state degeneracy. Thus, our goal of detecting
symmetries could be achieved using the two step ap-
proach that could even help design a control over the
timescale of the relaxation process.
Inspired by these
ideas and the timely application of detecting symmetries
we explore the points presented in this section using two
concrete examples of a 4-site model and the archetypal
benzene molecule.

that exhibits molecular symmetries is a 4-site model as

given by,

(2)

In the above the sum over hi, ji indicates nearest neigh-
bor interactions with cyclic boundary conditions. This
Hamiltonian within the H¨uckle theory of atomic molec-
ular orbitals can be interpreted as having 4 atomic sites
with nearest neighbor interaction [21, 22]. The diagonal
elements ε represent the combination of kinetic energy
and Coulomb integrals whereas the oﬀ-diagonal coeﬃ-
cient h represents the nearest-neighbor overlap between
atomic sites.

The system is connected to left and right leads that
govern the transitions of excitons between the ground
state eg and the excited states e1 and e3. The presence
of two leads at diﬀerent temperatures creates a nonequi-
librium setup that generates a ﬂow of excitons within

the molecular system. The eﬀect of the leads is modeled
via a Lindblad term in the master equation (see methods
section) whose Lindblad operators read

AL1 = |egihe1|,
AR1 = |egihe3|,

AL2 = |e1iheg|,
AR2 = |e3iheg|.

(4)

The nonequilibrium 4-site model exhibits two nonequi-
librium steady states [3, 5, 23] due to the existence of a
unitary operator Π = exp (|e2ihe4| + |e4ihe2|). The op-
erator Π, also known as the symmetry operator, obeys
[Π, HS] = [Π, Aαk] = 0 (α = L, R; k = 1, 2) due to
which the time evolution of a general density matrix ρ
can be decomposed into invariant subspaces (see meth-
ods section for a general proof).

Our goal in this work is to devise a scheme to detect
molecular symmetries using the excitonic currents.
In
order to achieve this objective we introduce a probe that
acts on the system as a site speciﬁc dynamical noise with-
out injecting or extracting excitons. When the probe
acts on sites 1 (S = |e1ihe1|) or 3 (S = |e3ihe3|) the
Hamiltonian of the probe-system interaction commutes
with the original symmetry operator (see methods sec-
tion). On the other hand the action of the probe on site
2 (S = |e2ihe2|) or 4 (S = |e4ihe4|) breaks the symmetry
of the system leading to a single unique nonequilibrium
steady state. Hence, the dynamics of the excitonic cur-
rents would exhibit signatures depending on the position
of the probe. We incorporate the eﬀects of the probe via
a Redﬁeld tensor as shown in the methods section. Sim-
ilar probes, e.g. the B¨uttiker probe [24], have been used
to investigate eﬀects of coherence [24], interference [10]
and also to measure temperatures at a molecular level
[25].

The behavior of excitonic currents for the 4-site model
starting from diﬀerent initial conditions and diﬀerent
probe positions is shown in Fig. 1. The probe is acting
either on site 1 (unbroken symmetry case) or on site 2
(broken symmetry case). The three initial conditions
correspond to the symmetric exchange of sites 2 and

In order to understand the dynamics of the currents we

pends on two important factors, namely, the eigenval-
ues Λk and the weight determined by the overlap of the
corresponding left eigenoperator with the initial density
matrix hΦl
k|ρ(0)i. The eigenspectrum for the dissipative
Liouvillian for our 4-site model is shown in Fig. 2. The
probe, when placed at site 2, produces a subtle eﬀect by
splitting the degenerated zero eigenvalues as indicated in
Fig. 2b. The eigenvalue that separates from the zero (in-
dicated by Λ1) corresponds to the unstable steady state
and has an antisymmetric structure. Thus, its left eigen-
operator overlap with the symmetric initial condition is
zero and the dynamics of the excitonic currents is gov-
erned by the remaining eigenvalues and eigenoperators
that are not drastically aﬀected due to the probe posi-
tion. Therefore, we ﬁnd that for the symmetric initial
condition there are no dynamical signatures of symme-
tries in the excitonic currents as shown in Fig. 1a.

The antisymmetric initial condition (also known as the
dark state) [28] is one of the multiple steady states (un-
stable manifold). In this state the excitonic currents are
exactly zero as shown by the black solid line in Fig. 1. As
soon as we break the symmetry we observe a slow relax-
ation for the excitonic currents due to the transition from
the unstable to the unique steady state. The timescale of
this transition is now governed by the dissipative Liou-
villian eigenvalue corresponding to the unstable steady
state Λ−1
1 which is several magnitudes larger than the
relaxation time for the symmetric initial condition (note
the x-axis in Figs. 1a and b). We also ﬁnd that there
is no change in the time-dependent excitonic currents if
the probe is placed at site 2 or 4. Thus, the slow quasi-
stationary relaxation, when initiating from a dark state,
provides a clear signature of symmetries in the dynamical
currents that inherently depend on the probe position.

FIG. 3. Probe temperature T dependence on the dynamics of excitonic currents.
(a) shows the current as a
function of time for diﬀerent temperatures [T = 200K (blue curve), 300K (black curve), and 400K (red curve)] when the cutoﬀ
frequency of the probe is very large, i.e. τP ≪ τS, for any temperature the behavior is the same and all the lines collapse,
whereas (b) depicts the small cutoﬀ frequency case, i.e., τP ≫ τS. Inset in panel (a) depicts the normalized relaxation time
τnorm = τM |T /τM |T0 where τM |T and τM |T0 are the relaxation times evaluated at temperature T and T0 = 100K. The solid
curve in the inset is for the case when τP ≫ τS, whereas the dotted line is for τP ≪ τS. In both panels the system is initiated
in an antisymmetric state. All other parameters are the same as in Fig. 1.

the stable and unstable steady states. The unstable
steady state does not contribute to the dynamics because
its relative overlap with the canonical initial condition is
much smaller than the overlap with the stable steady
state. Hence, the mechanism leading to dynamics that is
independent of the probe position is very similar to the
symmetric initial condition case. Thus, the canonical
initial condition, that is extensively used to study trans-
port using nonequilibrium Greens function [29], hierarchy
equation of motion [10], and polaron transformation [16],
makes it impossible to detect molecular symmetries.

Our results described above are robust even in pres-
ence of a weak disorder. We introduce a static random
disorder ∆εi at each site ei (∀i 6= g) chosen from a uni-

form distribution with width δ (cid:0)∆εi ∈ [− δ

citonic currents are averaged over 100 samples (enough
to achieve convergence) of disorder to obtain the closed
circles plotted in Fig. 1b. If the disorder is weak (much
weaker than the eﬀect of the probe, i.e., δ2 ≪ γ), then
the eigenspectrum of the dissipative Liouvillian (Fig. 2
asterisk) is overall not aﬀected by the disorder. Although
one major diﬀerence occurs, i.e., the symmetries are bro-
ken and we obtain one unique steady state [the steady
state for the weakly disordered system is close to the
green open circle in Fig. 2b (not shown)]. Since the weak
disorder acts on the longest timescale τdis ∝ δ−2 of the
problem, we observe the dynamics at an intermediate
timescale by ignoring the longer times that are aﬀected
by the disorder.
In this intermediate timescale regime
the disorder is insigniﬁcant and the dynamics is simi-
lar to the perfectly symmetric scenario (black solid and
green dashed-dotted line in Fig. 1b). Hence, a priori if
it is known that a weak disorder aﬀects the system of

interest, its eﬀects could be neglected by observing the
current dynamics at an intermediate timescale.

Next we investigate the eﬀects of probe properties
on the dynamics when initiated from the antisymmetric
state and the probe is placed at site 2. Due to the broken
symmetry the unstable steady state forms a Hermitian
decay mode, i.e., right eigenoperator of the dissipative Li-
ouvillian with non-zero real eigenvalue [30], that remain
closest to the zero eigenvalue (unique steady state). Since
this mode is formed due to the presence of the probe its
eigenvalue is sensitive to the probe properties thus inﬂu-
encing the relaxation time [31].

Although this argument seems straightforward there is
a caveat in terms of the dominant timescales of the prob-
lem. The timescale of the probe dynamics is governed
by the cutoﬀ frequency of the probe ωD, i.e., τP ∝ ω−1
D ,
whereas the coherent system dynamics timescale is given
by τS ∝ ∆ where ∆ is the smallest ﬁnite energy diﬀer-
ence in the system eigenspectrum. These timescales play
an inﬂuential role in determining the relaxation time of
the system τM . Figure 3 shows the eﬀect of interplay
between these two timescales. When the system dynam-
ics timescale dominates over the probe τS ≫ τP , the
probe has very little inﬂuence on the relaxation time τM .
The probe merely creates a unique steady state and a
change in probe parameters, e.g. temperature, does not
strongly inﬂuence the eigenvalue of the unstable steady
state Λ1. Thus, as a result the system relaxes quickly
to the unique steady state and a change in probe tem-
perature shows no eﬀect as seen in the inset of Fig. 3a.
On the other hand when the probe timescale dominates
the system τP ≫ τS the probe can strongly inﬂuence the
relaxation time τM . In this case a change in the parame-

ters, e.g. probe temperature, causes a proportional shift
of the unstable steady state along the real axis thus in-
ﬂuencing the relaxation time (inset of Fig. 3a). Since the
shift is proportional to the temperature of the probe it
is expected that the eigenvalue Λ1 would be very close
to zero for small values of temperature. Therefore, initi-
ating from the antisymmetric state at low temperatures
leads to a slow quasi-stationary relaxation towards the
unique nonequilibrium steady state due to the strong in-
teraction of the initial condition with the unstable steady
state.

Thus, overall by changing the probe position and care-
fully engineering the initial state to a dark state [5, 6, 30]
we detect the signatures of molecular symmetries. These
signatures correspond to observing exactly zero exci-
tonic currents for symmetric systems and a ﬁnite time-
dependent current with a long quasi-stationary plateau
for systems with broken symmetry via the probe. Inter-
estingly, the signatures completely vanish for the sym-
metric and canonical initial conditions making these an
unacceptable choice for symmetry detection.

wherein we choose the parameters ε = −11.2eV and
h1 = −0.7eV [32]. The benzene molecule is connected
to Lindblad leads similar to Eqs. (3) and (4). The
para-benzene ring has two symmetry operators (Π1 =
exp (|2ih6| + |6ih2|) and Π2 = exp (|3ih5| + |5ih3|)) due
to which the system has 3 multiple steady states. Only
one of these multiple steady states contains nonequilib-
rium information (e.g. temperature TL, TR or coupling
strength Γ) about the leads. The other two are pure
states are decoupled from the leads and depend only on
the symmetries.

The steady states that depend only on the symmetries

can be obtained analytically and they are given by

wherein |ψii are eigenvectors of the benzene Hamilto-
nian. The nonequilibrium steady state ρ0 depends on all
the lead properties and is nontrivial to obtain.
In the
presence of a probe ρ1 and ρ2 become unstable. In order
to understand how the probe aﬀects the multiple steady
states we project the full dissipative Liouvillian, Eq. (18),
into the subspace of the multiple steady states. This is
achieved by transforming the steady states into vectors
and the dissipative Liouvillian into a matrix as done in

Eq. (5). Thus, the 3 × 3 perturbation matrix reads

Above we have taken into consideration that several in-
dependent probes could act on the system whose ac-
tions are taken into account via the summed index p.
The operator elements are Sjk = hψj|S|ψki and Wjk =
0 dte−i∆jk tC(t) with ∆jk = Ej − Ek. Here Ek is the
eigenenergy of the benzene Hamiltonian corresponding
to the state |ψki. The perturbation matrix δL has one
zero eigenvalue corresponding to the unique nonequilib-
rium steady state and two non-zero eigenvalues that dic-
tate the relaxation time. The structure of the matrix
δL clearly indicates that the elements Rjk govern the ef-
fect of the probe on the symmetries of the system. Since
the probe obeys detailed balance the backward transition
rates Re[W p
12] are extremely small. Thus, we can neglect
the matrix element R12 ≈ 0 and simplify the perturba-
tion matrix. This simpliﬁcation occurs only due to the
probe properties and does not depend on how the probe
connects to the system.

The matrix element R21 controls the structure of the
eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix and depends only
on how the probe connects to the system (via operator
S). In particular, we ﬁnd that when R21 6= 0 the non-
zero eigenvalues of δL form a complex conjugate pair.
On the other hand when R21 = 0 we break all the sym-
metries and obtain three distinct eigenvalues of the per-
turbation matrix. In order to validate our claim we take
the simplest example of a single probe p = 1 that breaks
the symmetry of the system and connects via a general
l=g,1 Cl|elihel| with Cl being constants.

Thus, in order to achieve R21 = 0 we require

(C2 − C3 − C5 + C6) = 0.

(11)

If C2 = C3 = C5 = C6 then the probe is aﬀecting all
the symmetric sites of benzene equally without breaking
any symmetry. Thus, even though Eq. (11) is satisﬁed
we obtain 3 multiple steady-states. Hence it is of utmost
importance that the probe breaks at least one of the sym-
metries of benzene. If we choose a local probe acting on
site 2, i.e., C3 = C5 = C6 = 0, it breaks some but not all
the symmetries [since Eq. (11) is not satisﬁed]. This case

para-benzene symmetry is broken via a local probe acting on site 2 (as depicted in the illustration above). (b) the probe is acting
non-locally on sites 2 and 3 (illustrated above panel b) to break all the symmetries of the system. The black plus corresponds
to the eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix δL [Eq. (9)], whereas the green open triangles correspond to the smallest (in
magnitude) eigenvalues of the full dissipative Liouvillian. The system parameters are: ε = −11.2eV and h = −0.7eV. The lead
and probe parameters are chosen as: TL = 330K, TR = 270K, TP = 300K, Γ = 151.9THz, γ = 15.19THz, ωD = 151.92THz
and ω0 = 78.55THz.

leads to a unique steady state even if not all the sym-
metries are broken. The eigenvalues of the perturbation
matrix (black plus) and the full dissipative Liouvillian
(green triangles) are plotted in Fig. 4a for this case. Due
to the fact that we are not breaking all the symmetries,
we obtain a couple of non-zero eigenvalues that are con-
jugated and there is only one relaxation time (given by
the real part of the non-zero eigenvalue). The dynamical
currents are unable to show any exclusive signatures of
the three steady states. The current dynamics are qual-
itatively similar to the 4-site model (see supplementary
material). In order to break all the symmetries we take
the simplest case C2 = C3 and C5 = C6 = 0. In this case
the probe acts non locally on sites 2 and 3 [Eq. (11) is

satisﬁed]. This leads to three distinct real eigenvalues of
the perturbation matrix as shown in Fig. 4b.

The left-eigenvectors corresponding to the distinct
non-zero eigenvalues inherit the symmetry properties
of the unstable steady states. Particularly the left-
eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue closest to
zero retains the symmetry of ρ1 whereas the one further
away transforms into a linear combination of ρ1 and
ρ2. Thus, we initiate the system in a state that is
antisymmetric in sites 2 and 5 (equivalent to ρ1) and
ﬁnd that at long times both the non-zero eigenvalues
closest to the steady state (Λ1 and Λ2) will contribute
to the relaxation time. Hence, due to the remnants of
the unstable steady states in the Hermitian decay modes

with disorder strength δ = 1meV. The currents are averaged
over 100 samples of uniformly distributed random disorder.
All other parameters are same as Fig. 4.

we can uncover the signatures of the multiple steady
state as seen in the current dynamics in Fig. 5. At
long times the current dynamics exhibits two distinct
exponential relaxation times τ1 ∝ Λ−1
and τ2 ∝ Λ−1
2 .

The corresponding coeﬃcients of the exponential decays
are are opposite in sign and hence the excitonic current
shows a peak indicating the presence of two unstable
steady states. Here once again similar to the 4-site
model a weak static disorder in the system, as shown by
the closed green circles in Fig. 5, plays no role at the
relevant timescale. Thus, by redesigning the probe to act
non locally it is possible to detect the number of multiple
steady states by observing the multi-exponential decay
at long times.

Discussion and Conclusions

Several molecular systems possess symmetries that
could play a crucial role in the nonequilibrium properties
of the quantum devices. Naturally, one wonders if
it is possible to detect symmetries without any prior
knowledge of the molecular system. In the present study,
we provide a toolbox that detects molecular symmetries
via the measurement of excitonic currents.

Our goal is achieved by introducing a probe that acts
on various sites of the molecular junction and depending
on the probe position the currents diﬀer suggesting the
presence of symmetries. In particular, we ﬁnd signatures
of molecular symmetries if we start from an antisymmet-
ric (dark) state as our initial condition.
If the probe
is then positioned on a site that preserves the molec-
ular symmetry we ﬁnd zero excitonic currents because
the dark state belongs to an invariant subspace of the
nonequilibrium set-up. On the other hand if the probe is

7

placed on one of the symmetric sites it breaks the inher-
ent symmetry of the system leading to a quasi-stationary
plateau in the excitonic currents. When the probe is
placed on any of the symmetric sites we see identical
time-dependence of the excitonic current indicating that
these sites are interchangeable, i.e., symmetric. These
signatures vanish if we initiate the system in the sym-
metric or canonical initial condition making the antisym-
metric state a primary choice for symmetry detection.

Our detection scheme is based on dynamical signatures
in transient currents and is robust against the weak dis-
order. The strength of the disorder must be weaker than
that of the probe, such that the eﬀect of disorder does
not appear except for the longest timescale. Thus, by ig-
noring the longest timescale τdis ∝ δ−2 the dynamics at
intermediate timescales becomes identical to that with-
out disorder.
In other words, even for a weakly disor-
dered symmetric system we could detect the underlying
symmetries using the probe, since the dynamics at inter-
mediate timescale mimics the long-time dynamics of the
perfectly symmetric system.

Since the antisymmetric state is our prime choice for
symmetry detection we also study the eﬀect of probe
properties on the dynamics,
if we initiate the system
from this state. We ﬁnd that the interplay between
the timescales of the probe and the system dynamics
play a signiﬁcant role in determining the dynamics and
the relaxation time of the system. In particular, when
the molecular symmetry is broken, the system possess
a long relaxation time that scales with temperature if
the timescale of the probe dynamics is much larger than
the system (τP ≫ τS). In the opposite case temperature
shows no eﬀect on the relaxation time indicating that the
probe does not aﬀect the unstable steady state leading to
quick relaxation. The long relaxation time indicates the
presence of a long-lived quantum quasi-stationary distri-
bution [35] that survives due to its interaction with the
unstable steady state.

In case of the symmetric para-benzene molecule we
found three nonequilibrium steady states.
In order to
break all the symmetries we analyzed the system by
treating the probe as a perturbation and showed that
the multiple symmetries can be broken via a redesigned
probe. Our new probe acted on two sites of the para-
benzene ring simultaneously and led to a bi-exponential
decay in the current dynamics. The bi-exponential de-
cay exhibited long relaxation times and the exponents
corresponded to the eigenvalues of the unstable mani-
fold. This trend of multi-exponent decays corresponding
to the number of symmetries present was then recognized
as the second key signature to detect symmetries.

Overall, our work provides a ﬁrst glimpse into sym-
metry detection in nonequilibrium transport set-ups
and could be extended to systems such as conjugated
dendrimers [36],
light-harvesting complexes [37], C60
bucky balls [38], etc.
to detect naturally occurring
symmetries.

Methods
It has been previously proved
Invariant subspaces.
that a Lindblad master equation has invariant subspaces
if there is a unitary operator that commutes with all
the master equation elements [3, 23]. In this section we
extend this proof to a general open system. We begin
with a microscopic description and decompose the total
Hamiltonian as H = HS + HB + HBS. The Hilbert
space of the total system is decomposed in the direct
product of our system of interest (S), and the bath (B),

H = HS ⊗ HB with HS ∈ O(cid:0)HS(cid:1), HB ∈ O(cid:0)HB(cid:1), and
HBS = Pj S ⊗ Yj ∈ O(cid:0)HS(cid:1) ⊗ O(cid:0)HB(cid:1). The bath B

in our description could comprise of several leads and
probes, e.g., HB = HL + HR + HP , where the sub-scripts
L, R, and P correspond to the left-lead, right-lead, and
the probe.

[Π, HS] = [Π, S] = 0.

O(cid:0)HS(cid:1) s.t.

We assume that there is a unitary operator Π ∈
The total
Hilbert space can be decomposed in mutually orthog-
onal eigenspaces of Π, i.e., H = ⊕ns
i=1Hi with ns be-
ing the number of eigenvalues of Π.
In an equivalent
way the Hamiltonian of the system can be decomposed
HS = ⊕ns
i . As the operator Π is compatible with all
the components of the Hamiltonian they share an eigen-
basis and each part of the Hamiltonian can be block-
diagonalised. This implies that if |ψαi ∈ Hk the following
statements hold

i=1HS

Redﬁeld-Lindblad quantum master equation. The
nonequilibrium transport set-up described within this
work can be modeled using the total Hamiltonian,

H = HS + HL + HR + HP + HLS + HRS + HP S, (16)

wherein HS describes the system and Hα describes the
left-lead, right-lead and the probe with α = L, R and P
respectively. The interaction of the system with the leads
and the probe is given via HαS. The leads and the probe
Hamiltonian are given by an inﬁnite set of independent
harmonic oscillators that read

Hα =

(17)

We assume the system-lead/probe interaction to be
weak (Born-approximation) and the leads/probe to
be memory-less (Markov-approximation). Additionally,
only for the leads, we assume that the dissipative ef-
fects of the leads should be relevant on a timescale
much longer than all ﬁnite times of the problem (secular-
approximation). Under these assumptions and initiating
the total system in a product state of the system, leads,
and probes, with no cross-correlations between the leads
and the probe, the master equation for the reduced den-
sity matrix reads [39, 40],

HS|ψki ∈ Hk; HBS|ψki ∈ Hk; S|ψki ∈ Hk.

(12)

˙ρ =Lρ

To deal with density matrices we deﬁne the adjoint op-
erator ˜V ∈ O (H) as ˜V (̺) = V ̺V † (̺ is the density
matrix for the total Hamiltonian). If the eigenvalues of
V are νk = eiΩk , (k = 1, 2, ..., ns), the adjoint opera-
tor eigenvalues are just the product of these eigenvalues
νkνl = ei(Ωk−Ωl). The adjoint space O (H) can be decom-
posed as O (H) = ⊕ns
l=1 Vkl. If a density matrix has
the form ̺kl = |ψkihψl|, it means that ̺kl ∈ Vkl. From
the spectral decomposition, together with Eq. (12), we
can derive that if ̺kl ∈ Vkl then

k=1 ⊕ns

[HS, ̺kl] ∈ Vkl; [HB, ̺kl] ∈ Vkl; [S, ̺kl] ∈ Vkl.

(13)

We work in the interaction picture, where the dynamics
of the system is given by the interaction Hamiltonian,
˙̺(t) = −i[HBS(t), ̺(t)], and the time dependence of the
interaction Hamiltonian is given by

HBS(t) = ei(HS +HP )tHBSe−i(HS +HB )t.

(14)

Combining Eqs. (13) and (14) it can be proved that

[HBS(t), ρkl] ∈ Vkl.

(15)

It is clear from Eq. (15) and the von Neumann equation
that if ̺(0) ∈ Vkl then ̺(t) ∈ Vkl. Consequently, since
tracing over the probe degrees of freedom doesn’t cause a
change in subspaces =⇒ ρ(t) ∈ Vkl. This completes our
general proof of the invariant subspaces in open quantum
systems.

Throughout this work we set  = 1 for notational sim-
plicity. The secular approximation causes the eﬀect of
the leads on the system to be described via the Gorini-
Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation [41,
42]. The Lindblad operators Aαk corresponding to the
α-th lead allow local injection (k = 1) or extraction
(k = 2) of one exciton to the molecular system H ′
S
(see Eq. (1)). The rates Γαi dictate the temperature
of each lead, namely, Γα1 = Γnα and Γα2 = Γ(nα + 1)
with Γ being the dissipation strength of each lead and
nα = [exp(βαω0) − 1]−1 the Bose-Einstein distribution
function. The ratio of the rates Γα1/Γα2 = exp(−βαω0)
obeys detailed balance where βα = 1/kBTα represents
the inverse temperature of the α-th lead and ω0 is the
characteristic phonon frequency of the lead.

The eﬀect of the probe on the system is described via
the Redﬁeld tensor [43] that allows us to study the in-
terplay of various additional timescales (due to the ab-
sence of secular approximation), e.g.
the system and
the probe dynamics timescales. The operator S in the
Redﬁeld tensor originates from the system-probe interac-
tion Hamiltonian that we choose to be of a general form
HP S = S ⊗ Y . The operator Y is then encapsulated in

the correlator C(t) = TrP h ˜Y (t)Y (0) exp (βHP )i where

β is the inverse temperature of the probe and ˜Y (t) is the
free-evolution of the probe operator Y with respect to the
probe Hamiltonian. We choose the probe operator to be

the collective position operator Y = −Pk ckxk with ck

being the coupling strength of each harmonic mode of
the probe to the system. Throughout this work, the ex-
plicit super-script P will be suppressed for convenience.

Full counting statistic for excitonic transport. In
order to quantify the excitation ﬂux through the sys-
tem we include a counting ﬁeld in the quantum master
Eq. (18) [5, 44, 45]. We ﬁrst introduce the reduced den-
sity matrix ρq(t) that is the projection of the density
matrix into the subspace of q excitations interchanged
between the system and the left-lead at time t. The prob-
ability of observing an exciton current Jq is thus given
by P (q) = Tr [ρq(t)]. The evaluation of this probability

9

is easier after a change of ensemble, made by introducing

the Laplace transform ρλ(t) =Pq ρq(t) exp(−λq) with λ

being a counting ﬁeld. The evolution of the density ma-
trix in the Laplace transformed ensemble ρλ(t) is given
by

Given the above density matrix as a function of the

tion as JL = (1/t) [∂λ log Zλ(t)]λ=0. Considering that

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

4-site model revisited
The results we show in the main text correspond to a
system where diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal elements of the
Hamiltonian H ′
S are chosen to be the same. This require-
ment can be relaxed. Symmetries could exist even if these
parameters are mismatched. In this section we explore a
more general case with the help of the 4-site model and
show that the signatures of molecular symmetries are ro-
bust. Thus, if the system possess a molecular symmetry
in any form our probe based approach could help detect
these symmetries. We begin by choosing a general 4-site
Hamiltonian

H ′

S =

Xi=1

εi|eiihei| +Xhi,ji

hij |eiihej|,

(22)

where the parameters εi and hij = hji are diﬀerent for
each site. In order to maintain the mirror symmetry of
the system we choose ε2 = ε4, h12 = h14, and h23 = h34.
Figure 6 shows the behavior of the excitonic currents
when the probe is placed either at site 1 (black solid
lines) or at site 2 (green dashed-dotted lines) for sym-

metric (panel a), antisymmetric (panel b) or canonical
(panel c) initial conditions. The conclusions remain the
same as in the main text, i.e., the signatures of molecular
symmetries is observed only in the case of a dark state
initial condition. One main diﬀerence we observe when
all parameters are not the same is the change in the dis-
sipative Liouvillian spectrum (Fig. 6d). Contrary to the
fully identical case (see Fig. 2 of main text) the eigen-
spectrum changes drastically. Although the splitting of
the degenerate eigenvalue still persists and the unstable
manifold still remains closest to the zero eigenvalue thus
inﬂuencing the long relaxation times of the system.

Eﬀect of probe position in para-Benzene
Similar to the 4-site model shown in the main text the
eﬀect of a local probe on benzene is shown in Fig. 7. The
qualitative features remain the same as in the 4-site sys-
tem with the anti-symmetric state showing the clear sig-
natures of multiple steady states. The Liouvillian spec-
trum also shows exotic modes like oscillating coherences
[1] that correspond to eigenvalues of the Liouvillian with
zero real part but ﬁnite imaginary part. These could
be the modes responsible for the observation of circular
currents observed in benzene [2].

FIG. 7. Eﬀect of probe position on symmetry detection.Time evolution of the excitonic current for the Benzene molecule
with symmetric in sites 2 and 6 (panel a), antisymmetric in sites 2 and 6 (panel b), and canonical (panel c) initial conditions.
The crosses and circles correspond to the nonequilibrium steady-state values of the excitonic currents. Panel (d) shows the
eigenspectrum of the dissipative Liouvillan and (e) depicts the magniﬁcation around zero eigenvalue. The probe is positioned at
sites 1 (black solid line panels a, b and c; black asterix in panels d and e) and 2 (green dashed-dotted line in panels a, b, and c;
green triangles in panels d and e). The system parameters are: ε = −11.2eV and h = −0.7eV. The lead and probe parameters
are chosen as: TL = 330K, TR = 270K, TP = 300K, Γ = 151.9THz, γ = 15.19THz, ωD = 151.92THz and ω0 = 78.55THz.
