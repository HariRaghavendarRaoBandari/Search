The joint distribution of the Parisian ruin time and the number of

claims until Parisian ruin in the classical risk model

Irmina Czarna∗ Yanhong Li† Zbigniew Palmowski‡ Chunming Zhao§

Abstract

In this paper we propose new iterative algorithm of calculating the joint distribution of the
Parisian ruin time and the number of claims until Parisian ruin for the classical risk model. Ex-
amples are provided when the generic claim size is exponentially distributed.

Keywords: classical risk model, number of claims, Parisian ruin.

1 Introduction

The distribution of the number of claims until ruin has been in the centre of interest for many

years. One of the ﬁrst references dealing with this problem is Beard [1]. The main ﬁrst step was done

by Stanford and Stroi´nski [17] who produced recursive procedures to calculate the probability of ruin

at the nth claim arrival epoch in the classical risk model. Eg´ıdo dos Reis [7] derived the moment

generating function of the number of claims until ruin in the classical risk model. He inverted this

for certain claim size distributions, and, using a duality argument, found moments of the number

of claims until ruin when the initial surplus is 0. The next main step was done by Landriault et

al. [13] who considered a Sparre Andersen risk model with exponential claims. Using Gerber-Shiu

type analysis (see Gerber and Shiu [9])) they derived a number of results including an expression for

the probability function of the number of claims until ruin. The main idea of getting these nice results

followed approach of Dickson and Willmot [6]. The main results of our paper are closely related with

the seminal paper of Dickson [5] who using probabilistic arguments derived the expression for the joint

density of the time of ruin and the number of claims until ruin in the classical risk model. From this

he obtained a general expression for the probability function of the number of claims until ruin. He

also considered the moments of the number of claims until ruin and illustrate all results in the case

of exponentially distributed individual claims. Frostig et al. [8] and Zhao and Zhang [18] analyzed

similar problems.

In this paper we extend results concerning classical ruin into so-called Parisian type of ruin. This

type of ruin occurs if the surplus process falls below zero and stays below zero for a continuous time

of interval of length d; see Figure 1. We believe that the Parisian ruin probability and other related

quantities might be more appropriate measures of risk than the ones identiﬁed for the classical ruin.

The main reason is that it gives the insurance companies the chance to achieve solvency. The idea of

Parisian ruin comes from Parisian options which was ﬁrst introduced by Chesney et al. [2]. Dassios

and Wu [4] considered the Parisian ruin probability for the classical risk model with exponential claims

and for the Brownian motion with drift. Czarna and Palmowski [3] and Loeﬀen et al. [15] analyzed

the Parisian ruin probability for a general spectrally negative L´evy process. Other relevant papers are

Landriault et al. [11] and [12], where the deterministic and ﬁx delay d is replaced by an independent

exponential random variable.

Our paper in a sense has similar goal like in Dickson [5] and Landriault et al. [11], that is we want

to identify the joint density of the time of Parisian ruin and the number of claims until Parisian ruin.

Although our focus is more consistent with Stanford and Stroi´nski [17] - we want to create eﬃcient

iterative algorithm of ﬁnding above quantity.

Formally, in this paper we consider a continuous-time surplus process:

U (t) := u + ct − Nt(cid:88)

Xi,

(1)

i=1

where the non-negative constant u denotes the initial reserve, the positive constant c is the rate of
premium income, Nt describes the number of claims counted up to time t which is a Poisson process
with parameter λ and {Xi}∞
i=1 are claim sizes which are independent and identically distributed
non-negative random variables that are also independent of Nt. We denote by F (x) and f (x) the
distribution function and density function, respectively. We assume c > λE(X1) assuring that ruin is
not certain.

Note that the d = 0 case corresponds to the classical ruin problem. Then we deal with the classical

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give the main representations of
the joint density of Nτ d and τ d and prove the main results. Finally, in Section 3 we analyze some
particular examples and give extensive numerical analysis.

2 Main representation

Since Parisian ruin occurs if the surplus falls below zero and stays below zero for a continuous

time interval of length d, Parisian ruin time must be larger than d. Throughout this paper, we can
u(n, t) = 0 when t ≤ d, u ≥ 0. For t > d and u ≥ 0 we will now identify the joint density

2.1 The expression of the joint density wu(k, t, y)

Our results heavily use the main result of Dickson [5]. He considers the joint density of the number
Nτu of claims until ruin (including the ruin-caused claim), τu given in (4) and the deﬁcit at ruin |U (τu)|
deﬁned by :

with

wu(k, t, y) :=

k ∈ N, t ≥ 0, y > 0

k ∈ N, t ≥ 0, y > 0.

For any function g we denote by gk∗ (k ≥ 0) the k-fold convolution of g with itself, where g1∗ = g
and g0∗(t) = δ0(t) for the impulse function δ0 at 0. We are now in position to state the main result of
Dickson [5].

Theorem 2.1 For k = 1, 2, . . . we have that

w0(k, t, y) =

f (k−1)∗(ct − x)f (x + y)dx

2.2 The joint distribution of the ﬁrst upward passage time and the number of

claims

For y ≥ 0 we deﬁne the ﬁrst upward passage time of our classical risk process:

We denote by

y = min{s ≥ 0, U (s) = y|U (0) = 0}.
τ +

vy(k, t) :=

d

Vy(k, t),

k ∈ N, t ≥ y/c

Vy(k, t) := P(Nτ +

= k, τ +

y ≤ t|U (0) = 0),

k ∈ N, t ≥ 0.

Theorem 2.3 We have:

vy(k, t) =

Subtracting φ(y − ct) from both sides of above equation, multiplying by 1/dt and letting dt → 0
produce the following integro-diﬀerential equation:

(cid:48)
cφ

(y) = −(λ + δ)φ(y) + λr

Clearly, when y = 0, we have

0

φ(0) = 1.

φ(y + x)f (x)dx.

(12)

(13)

Since the solution to (12) with boundary condition (13) is unique, we assume that φ(y) is of the form

φ(y) = c(y)e−by.

The boundary condition φ(0) = 1 gives c(y) = 1, so that φ(y) = e−by. Note that the real part of b
must be positive, because otherwise it would be a contradiction to the fact that limy→∞ φ(y) = 0. It
is known that the Lundberg’s fundamental equation of the classical risk model is given by

λ + δ − cs = λr ˆf (s).

We denote the positive solution by ρ.

Now, using a similar approach as in Li [14], Zhao and Zhang [18] we can obtain the solution of the

integro-diﬀerential equation (12):

φ(y) = e−ρy.

We recall now the Lagrange’s Expansion Theorem (see Lagrange [10, p. 251-326]). Given two

functions α(z) and β(z) which are both analytic on and inside a contour D surrounding a point a, if

r satisﬁes the inequality

(14)
for every z on the perimeter of D, then z − a− rϕ(z), as a function of z, has exactly one zero η in the
interior of D, and we have further

Proof. Fact that the Parisian ruin occurs in the time interval (0, t] and there is only one claim up to
Parisian ruin time, means that only one claim occurs before time t − d that cause the classical ruin,
the deﬁcit is larger than cd and there will be no claims within time that risk process spent below 0,

see Figure 2. This gives (18).

Fig. 2. The case of Parisian ruin with one claim

The arguments behind the formula (19) are as follows. We know that the Parisian ruin occurs

after classical ruin. There are only two cases:

• τ d

u = τu + d, i.e., the surplus will stay below zero for a continuous time interval of length d after
the classical ruin time. Let us assume that there are k (0 ≤ k ≤ n− 1) claims during the interval
(τu, τu + d] and n− k claims during the interval (0, τu]. If the deﬁcit at the classical ruin is more
than cd then the surplus can not exceed 0 before τu + d no matter how much the cumulative
amount of the k claims is. This covers the ﬁrst term of formula (19). However, if the deﬁcit is

less than cd (formulated as the second term) then it also includes the possibility that the surplus
has been up-crossing 0 prior to time τu + d which should be subtracted. To take into account
w suppose that τu + s is the ﬁrst time before τu + d at which there was an up-crossing of the
surplus process through 0 and there are m claims during the interval (τu, τu + s] and hence k− m
claims during the interval (τu + s, τu + d].

• τ d

u > τu + d, i.e., the surplus exceeds 0 in the interval (τu, τu + d] (we assume also that classical
ruin happens at time t1). We apply probabilistic arguments to construct the last term of (19);
see Prabhu [16]. We take τu + s to be the ﬁrst time before τu + d at which there is an up-crossing
of the surplus process through 0. Further, we suppose that there are l claims in (0, τu] and k
claims in (τu, τu + s]. Additionally, when risk process up-crosses zero it does in continuous way.
So we can restart the our considerations with u = 0, the Parisian ruin time equal to t − t1 − s
and (n − l − k) amount of claims counted up to this time.

In particular, from (19) for u = 0 we can obtain the following corollary.

3 Examples

We consider now generic claim size which is exponentially distributed with parameter µ, that is
f (x) = µe−µx for x > 0. In this section, we will compute all considered Parisian-type quantities and
give some insight on their possible shapes depending on the choice of parameters.

We noticed the following observations. The distributions are quite cumulated around the mode of
pd
u(n) as a function n. Moreover, for ﬁxed u, these probabilities ﬁrst increase then decrease when the
number of claims gets bigger. It seems the tails of this probability functions is surprisingly thick. In

fact, it seems that larger u produces thicker tail.

Now we will focus on more complex density wd
From (18) it follows that:

u(n, t). We will ﬁnd it using Theorem 2.5.

This iterative algorithm can produce wd

gets very complicated quite quickly. We suggest another numerical algorithm instead. We change the

u(n, t). Unfortunately, the computation process takes long time and the expression for wd

integration in the third increment of (21) and (19) into the summation using the rectangular method

of approximating deﬁnite integrals. Of course taking the step of the summation tending to 0 will give

right expression.

Let λ = 1, µ = 1, c = 1.2, d = 2. Here we divide up the interval [0, 10] into 100 equal subintervals.

Each has length ∆t =

0(n, t) at the right-hand endpoints of
these subinterval. Figure 7 shows that the approximation is very good. We noticed that the time of
