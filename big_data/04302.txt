Abstract
A new method to determine the CO-to-H2 conversion factor XCO using absorption of diffuse
X-ray emission by local molecular clouds was developed.
It was applied to the Ophiucus
(G353+17) and Corona Australis (G359-18) clouds using CO-line and soft X-ray archival data.
We obtained a value XCO = 1.85 ± 0.45 × 1020H2 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 as the average of least-χ2
ﬁtting results for R4 (0.7 keV) and R5 (0.8 keV) bands.

Key words: ISM: molecular gas – X-rays: diffuse background – ISM: absorption – ISM: CO line emission

1 Introduction

The CO-to-H2 (CO line intensity to H2 column density) con-
version factor, XCO, is one of the fundamental parameters in
the interstellar physics of molecular gas. It has been derived by
several methods, which include the Virial method (Solomon et
al. 1987), optical and infrared extinction method (Lombardi et
al. 2008), and γ-ray method (Bloemen et al. 1986).

Although the current measurements seem to have converged
to values around XCO ∼ 2 × 1020H2 cm−2(K km s−1)−1,
or XCO:20 = XCO/[1020H2 cm−2(K km s−1)−1] ∼ 2,
they
include still uncertainty ranging from XCO:20 ∼ 0.7 to 4
(Bolatto et al. 2014).
In fact, low values of 0.2 ∼ 0.5 ×
1020H2 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 have been obtained for the high
latitude Draco cloud, cirrus, and other high latitude clouds
(Moritz et al. 1998; and the literature cited therein), while a
high value of 3.46 ± 0.91 has been obtained for the Ophiucus
clouds (Paradis et al. 2012). Figure 1 summarizes the XCO
values obtained in the decades.

In this paper, we propose to use X-ray absorption to deter-
mine the XCO value for local molecular clouds. Low energy
X-ray absorption (∼ 0.2 keV) has been studied for investigating
the local hot plasma (Snowden et al. 2000), but few application
to the conversion factor. We developed a new method to de-
termine XCO, analyzing the CO (J = 1 − 0)line data from the

c(cid:13) 2014. Astronomical Society of Japan.

2 New Method for Determining the

Conversion Factor

2.1 Hydrogen Column Density

We consider HI and molecular gas intervening the observer and
the X-ray emission source. The hydrogen column density N
along the line of sight is given by observing the integrated HI-
and 12CO(J = 1 − 0)-line intensities, IHI and ICO, as

N = N (HI) + 2N (H2),

(1)

where N (HI) = XHIIHI and N (H2) = XCOICO. The coefﬁ-
cient XHI = 1.82 × 1018 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 is the HI intensity
to H column density conversion factor, and XCO is the CO-to-
H2 conversion factor to be determined in this work.

2.2 X-ray Intensity and Absorption

The background X-ray emission beyond a molecular cloud is
assumed to be originating from the galactic halo and bulge hot
plasma, and is assumed to be sufﬁciently uniform over the cloud
extent, ∼ 10 pc or several degrees on the sky. The foreground
emission is assumed to come from the local cavity (bubble), and
is also assumed to be almost ﬂat across the clouds.

The observed band-averaged X-ray intensity I toward a

cloud with column density N is given by

(2)

I =Z ψ(E)(cid:2)I0(E) + I1(E)e−N σ(E)(cid:3) dE.

Here, I0(E) and I1(E) are the foreground and background
spectral intensities at photon energy E, σ(E) is the absorption
coefﬁcient at E, and ψ(E) is the response function of the in-
strument.

In regions sufﬁciently away from the cloud, e.g. N ≃ 0, the

off-cloud band-averaged (observed) intensity is written as

Ioﬀ = hI0i + hI1i,

where

hI0i =Z ψ(E)I0(E)dE

and

hI1i =Z ψ(E)I1(E)dE.

For a later convenience we rewrite equation (2) as

I = hI0i + hI1iZ ψ(E)η(E)e−N σ(E)dE,

where

η(E) = I1(E)/hI1i

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

represents the normalized spectrum of the background emis-
sion, satisfying

Z ψ(E)η(E)dE = 1.

(8)

The function η(E) is calculated for an arbitrary emission mea-
sure assuming the temperature and metallicity using XSPEC
(Arnauld et al. 1996) as shown in ﬁgure 2.
In the current
shadow analysis, the so-called ’band-averaged cross section’ is
used (Snowden et al. 2000) 1, which is shown to be equivalent
to the present direct band-averaging method.

The instrument response was taken from Snowden et al.
(1997), and was approximated by Gaussian functions around
the band centers at E0 = 0.70, 0.83 and 1.11 keV with full
widths of half maximum of ∆E = 0.39, 0.45, and 0.40 keV, re-
spectively. This approximation was good enough in the present
accuracy of analysis.

2.3 Emission and Absorption Spectra

Figure 2 shows σ(E) plotted against E for neutral gas with so-
lar abundance, as generated by using ’ISMabs’ (Gatuzz et al.
2015) implemented in XSPEC (Arnauld et al. 1996). We also
show a cross section for ionization degree as high as 10%, un-
realistically high in interstellar clouds, in order to conﬁrm that
the contribution of ions is negligible.

The ﬁgure also shows an emission spectrum created using
XSPEC for an arbitrary ﬁxed emission measure of plasma with
temperature kT = 0.3 keV and metallicity Z = 0.2Z⊙, repre-
senting the galactic halo emission (Kataoka et al. 2013, 2015).
The spectral shape was used in the ﬁtting as the weighting func-
tion, and the intensity scale is so normalized that the band-
averaged intensity represents the observed intensity by equation
(2).

The gray line in ﬁgure 2 shows a spectrum of transmitted
emission in the R4 band through a cloud with optical depth
unity (τ = 1), as obtained by multiplying exp(−σ/σ4) to the
emissin spectrum in order to demonstrate that the transmitted
spectrum is ﬂat in regions with τ ∼ 1, where the absorption
analysis is most efﬁciently obtained.

We comment on the assumed metallicities: (a) The fore-
ground emissin is subtracted before ﬁtting, and hence its metal-
licity is not included.
(b) Metallicity variation in the back-
ground halo and bulge is assumed to be small across the cloud
extents. (c) Metallicity of molecular clouds is not known, but is
usually approximated by that of nearby stars or HII regions. As
the clouds are near the Sun, we assume the solar metallicity.

2.4 χ2 Fitting

Equations (2) and (6) can be solved for the two unknown pa-
rameters, XCO and hI0i (or hI0i = Ioﬀ − hI1i), by measuring
intensities Iobs at multiple positions. Practically, we determine
the parameters that minimize χ2 deﬁned by

and 6 (1.1) bands for a molecular cloud G353+17 (Ophiucus),
comet-like cloud G359-18 (CrA), and a near-galactic plane re-
gion. The R2 band was not used for too heavy absorption, nor
R6 and 7 for noisier data particularly around CrA. The ﬁgures
exhibit beautiful anticorrelation between the molecular gas and
X-ray intensities, demonstrating that the global X-ray structures
are determined by the interstellar absorption. This fact implies
that the intrinsic X-ray distribution is sufﬁciently ﬂat compared
to the intensity ﬂuctuation due to cloud extinction.

3.1 Ophiucus molecular cloud G353+17

The Ophiucus molecular cloud G353+17 (de Geus and Burton
1991) was chosen, because the surrounding X-rays are bright
and diffuse enough. The cloud is isolated, and its distance is
known to be d = 119 ± 6 pc (Lombardi et al. 2008). The densest
region is located at G353.0+16.7 (Liseau et al. 2010). Figure
4 shows that the shape of the soft X-ray shadow almost exactly
coincides with that of the molecular gas distribution.

The space between the cloud and the Sun is almost empty,
composing the local cavity (Puspitarini et al.
2014). The
dust extinction in the cavity is as low as E(B − V )pc−1 ∼
10−4mag pc−1 corresponding to N (H) ≃ 5 × 1021E(B −
V )d ≃ 0.6 × 1020H cm−2. Thus, we assume that HI inside the
cavity is constant at N (HI) = 0.6 × 1020H cm−2.

Beyond and surrounding the Oph cloud, HI is distributed
smoothly compared to the cloud size at
intensity IHI ∼
300 K km s−1 or N (HI) ∼ 5 × 1020cm−1(K km s−1)−1
(Kalberla et al. 2005). This diffuse HI gas may suppresses the
intrinsic X-ray background I1 by ∼ 10%.

The HI contribution within the cloud is negligible, as the H2
to HI column density ratio is observed to be N(H2)/N(HI)=56
in the Oph cloud by HI self absorption (Minn et al. 1981), or
HI contributes only ∼ 2%, which, however, does not affect the
ﬁtting after the on-off position subtraction.

3.2 Corona Australis cloud G359-18

G359-18 cloud in Corona Australis (CrA) is a well known
southern comet-like dark cloud associated with the reﬂection
nebula NGC 6729 and B stars as well as infrared emission
(Odenwald 1988).
It is located at a distance of 129 ± 11 pc
(Casey et al. 1998). The cloud appears as an isolated shadow
against nearly uniform bulge X-ray emission. We here assume
the same HI condition as for the Oph cloud.

where Iobs and si are observed X-ray intensity and dispersion
at the i-th measured position, respectively, and I is calculated
using equation (2) for observed ICO at the same position corre-
sponding to the assumed parameter pair of XCO and hI0i.

The off-cloud intensity Ioﬀ = hI1i + hI0i, representing the
baseline value, was measured as the mean of I at positions suf-
ﬁciently away from the cloud. Figure 3 illustrates the deﬁnition
of the variables using an intensity variation across Cr A molecu-
lar cloud in R4 band. More practically, we measured an average
of intensity I at positions where ICO is sufﬁciently small with
ICO ≤ ICO:oﬀ = 0.5K km s−1.

line survey and ROSAT X-ray maps in R4 (0.7 keV), 5 (0.8)

We also applied the method to a near-plane region as shown in
ﬁgure 4. The gas distribution is well anti-correlated with the
X-ray emission. However, we here consider the result only for
reference, as the area is too wide for the assumption of a ﬂat X-

ICO ≤ 20 K km s−1 in order to avoid the galactic plane region
at |b| <∼ 3◦ (dark CO regions in ﬁgure 4).

4.1 TT Plot

Figure 5 shows plots of the observed X-ray intensity (Iobs)
against CO-line intensity (ICO). Gray dots are raw values at
individual pixels, and full circles are Gaussian-averaged values
in ICO bins each 0.5 K km s−1 used as observed Iobs corre-
sponding to ICO in equation (9). The plotted Iobs values at
ICO ≤ 20K km s−1 can be well approximated by a smooth
curve representing the absorption. The χ2 ﬁtting is thus applied
to data with ICO ≤ 20 K km s−1.

4.2 χ2 Fitting

In order to apply the χ2 ﬁtting, we ﬁrst measured the off cloud
X-ray intensities, Ioﬀ, as the mean of observed values at posi-
tions where the CO intensity is less than 0.5 K km s−1. Using
equation (9), we apply the χ2 ﬁtting to the averaged intensities
Iobs and ICO indicated in ﬁgure 5 and associated standard de-
viations si. Figure 6 shows the variation of calculated χ2 value
as a function of XCO for different hI1i values near the χ2 min-
imum.

The χ2 values were computed for various combinations of
the two parameters hI1i and XCO, and are shown in ﬁgure 6.
The best ﬁtting value for XCO was found by ﬁtting a parabola
to the three pairs of (hI1i, XCO) in the region of minimum χ2 .
The ﬁtting error was calculated as the range of XCO that allows
an increase of χ2 by 1 for a ﬁxed hI1i near the χ2 minimum.

Table 1 lists the χ2 ﬁtting results. The results for R6 band are
largely scattered due to the noisier data compared to the other
two bands. Thus, we adopted the R4 and R5 band values, and
averaged them to yield a mean value of XCO:20 = 1.85 ± 0.45.

5 Discussion

We described the χ2 ﬁtting method to determine the CO-to-
H2 conversion factor using X-ray shadows by molecular clouds.

The method was applied to the Ophiucus and CrA molecular
clouds, which were so chosen that they are conveniently located
in the direction of the diffuse X-ray halo and bulge whose intrin-
sic distribution is considered to be sufﬁciently uniform within
the analyzed scales. The two clouds are local and hence, the
XCO values apply to clouds with the solar metallicity.

By minimizing χ2 , the CO-to-H2 conversion factor was de-
termined as listed in table 1, and the conversion factor deter-
mined to be XCO:20 = 1.85 ± 0.45 as the average value for the
two clouds. The value is compared with the current values in
ﬁgure 1, and is close the mean of the disk values. This is consis-
tent with the fact that the two clouds are local at heights z ∼ ±30
pc from the galactic plane.

We also tried to apply the method to a near-galactic plane
region, but only for reference, as the assumption of uniform X-
ray background may not hold in this large area. Nevertheless,
we obtained consistent XCO values within the larger errors as
in table 1.

Figure 1 shows a frequency distribution of measured XCO
values, mostly from the well summarized table by Bolatto et
al.
(2013), where low values XCO:20 < 0.5 in high latitude
clouds (Moritz et al. 1998) are also plotted . The ﬁgure ex-
hibits two groups of XCO:20 values around ∼ 2 and <∼ 0.5.
This might suggest that the disk and high-latitude clouds have
different chemical properties.

The present X-ray shadow method may be an independent
tool to measure XCO in individual molecular clouds. It will be
worth to compare our results with other measurements.

• Oph cloud: de Geus and Burton (1990) obtained a Virial mass
of the Oph cloud as large as 5 − 7 × 104M⊙•, an order of mag-
nitude more massive than the converted mass of 9 × 103M⊙•
for an assumed XCO:20 = 2.6. From this discrepancy, they
argue that the Oph cloud will not be virialized. This may im-
ply that the present shadow method can be a useful tool to
measure XCO in non-virialized clouds.

• CrA cloud: Ackermann et al.

(2012) obtained XCO:20 =
0.99 ± 0.08 by applying the γ-ray method to their Fermi
data. This value is consistent with our R4 band value of
1.24 ± 0.06, and is not inconsistent with the R5 value of
2.31 ± 0.57.

• Near Galactic plane: Ade et al.

(2011) applied the dust-
extinction method to the Planck data for galactic dark clouds,
and obtained XCO:20 = 2.54 ± 0.13. Paradis et al. (2012)
obtained a relatively high value, 3.46 ± 0.91, for Oph-Aauila
region at b ≥ 10◦ using the dust extinction method. These
regions are partly overlapping with our GP area, and their
XCO:20 values are consistent with our R4 and R5 values,
XCO:20 = 2.67 ± 0.41 and 2.24 ± 0.36, respectively.

Finally we comment on the limitation of the present method.
Constant foreground HI emission, 0.6 × 1020H cm−2, was as-
sumed in the local cavity. However, an increase of this value

by 0.1 × 1020 will decrease XCO by ∼ 1%, and vice versa.
Absorption by cold HI gas within molecular clouds was shown
to be negligible in the Oph cloud, which may also apply to CrA.
On the other hand, contribution of cold HI may be more se-
rious when the method is applied to dense and more massive
clouds as GMCs. Another uncertainty arises from the intrinsic
inhomogeneity of the back- and fore-ground X-ray emissions.
This difﬁculty could be eased by applying the method to smaller
clouds at higher angular resolutions, providing with more accu-
rate determinations.
