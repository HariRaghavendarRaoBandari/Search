Abstract

Kenyon, Miller, Sheﬃeld, and Wilson (2015) showed how to encode a random
bipolar-oriented planar map by means of a random walk with a certain step size
distribution. Using this encoding together with the mating-of-trees construction
of Liouville quantum gravity due to Duplantier, Miller, and Sheﬃeld (2014), they
proved that random bipolar-oriented planar maps converge in the scaling limit to

a(cid:112)4/3-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface decorated by an independent

SLE12 in the peanosphere sense, meaning that the height functions of a particular
pair of trees on the maps converge in the scaling limit to the correlated planar
Brownian motion which encodes the SLE-decorated LQG surface. We improve
this convergence result by proving that the pair of height functions for an inﬁnite-
volume random bipolar-oriented triangulation and the pair of height functions for
its dual map converge jointly in law in the scaling limit to the two planar Brownian

motions which encode the same(cid:112)4/3-LQG surface decorated by both an SLE12

curve and the “dual” SLE12 curve which travels in a direction perpendicular (in
the sense of imaginary geometry) to the original curve. This conﬁrms a conjecture
of Kenyon, Miller, Sheﬃeld, and Wilson (2015).

Introduction

1.1 Overview

A planar map is a planar graph together with an embedding into R2, where the
embedding is speciﬁed up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms of R2. In recent
years there has been an interest in understanding the geometry of randomly chosen
planar maps, partly motivated by applications in quantum gravity, conformal ﬁeld
theory, and string theory. In this context, a random planar map is a natural model of a
discrete random surface.

In the continuum, a natural model of a random surface is a Liouville quantum gravity
(LQG) surface, which is deﬁned as follows. Let γ ∈ (0, 2) and let h be an instance of
the Gaussian free ﬁeld (GFF) or a related distribution on a domain D ⊂ C. Formally
the γ-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface associated with h is the Riemannian
manifold with metric tensor given by

eγh(z)(dx2 + dy2),

(1.1)

where dx2 + dy2 denotes the Euclidean metric tensor on D. This expression does not
make literal sense since h is a distribution and does not take values at points, but one
can make sense of the volume form associated with (1.1) as a random measure [DS11].
See also [RV14] and the references therein for an equivalent formulation.

It is conjectured that a wide class of random planar map models converge under an
appropriate scaling limit to LQG surfaces (with parameter γ depending on the model)
In many of these models, the random planar
as the size of the map tends to ∞.
map is naturally decorated by a statistical physics model which can be represented

2

by a curve or a collection of loops. Often such curves or collections of loops are
conjectured to converge in the scaling limit to a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE)
curve [Sch00] or a conformal loop ensemble (CLE) [She09], independent from the

quantum surface, with parameter1. given by either κ = γ2 ∈ (0, 4) or κ(cid:48) = 16/γ2 >

4. See [DS11, She09, She16a, She16b, DMS14, KMSW15] for rigorous mathematical
formulations of conjectures of this form and the references therein for related predictions
in the physics literature.

There are various ways to formulate the above scaling limit conjectures. One way
is to conformally embed a random planar map into C (e.g. via circle packing or
Riemann uniformization) and try to prove that the random area measure which assigns
a point mass to each vertex converges under an appropriate scaling limit to the
LQG measure [DS11, She16a, DMS14] and that the statistical mechanics model, thus
embedded, converges in an appropriate sense to SLE or CLE. Such scaling limit results
have not been established rigorously for any non-trivial random planar maps. However,
other convergence results for random planar maps have been established rigorously.
LeGall and Miermont [LG13, Mie13] proved that uniform quadrangulations (equipped
with a re-scaling of the graph distance) converge in law with respect to the Gromov-
Hausdorﬀ topology to a continuum metric space called the Brownian map. In the recent
or upcoming works [MS15c, MS15a, MS15b, MS16d, MS16e] the authors show that

isometric to the Brownian map. However, metric scaling limit results have not been

there is a metric on a γ-LQG sphere for γ =(cid:112)8/3 [DMS14, MS15c] under which it is
rigorously established for γ (cid:54)=(cid:112)8/3. Indeed, it remains an open problem to rigorously

construct a metric on LQG in this case.

An alternative notion of convergence for certain random planar map models has
been established based on the so-called peanosphere construction of [DMS14]. This
construction encodes a γ-LQG cone (resp. an LQG sphere) [DMS14] decorated by an
independent space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) curve [MS13a] for κ(cid:48) = 16/γ2 in terms of correlated two-
dimensional Brownian motion (resp. excursion) Z = (L, R) with correlation − cos(πγ2/4)
(see [GHMS15] for a proof of the correlation in the case when γ ∈ (0,√2)). We will
review the details of this construction in Section 1.4.3 below.

Certain random planar maps, possibly decorated with a statistical physics model, can
be encoded by means of certain two-dimensional random walks via discrete analogues
of the peanosphere construction. If one can show that the walk encoding the random
planar map converges in the scaling limit to a two-dimensional Brownian motion with
correlation − cos(πγ2/4), then one obtains convergence of the random planar map
model toward SLE-decorated γ-LQG in a certain sense, which we call the peanosphere
sense. Peanosphere scaling limit results for various random planar map models are
proven in [She16b, GMS15, GS15a, GS15b, KMSW15, GKMW16]. See also [GM16]
for a scaling limit result for FK planar maps in a stronger topology which is proven

1Here and throughout the rest of the paper we use the convention of [MS16a, MS16b, MS16c, MS13a]

of writing κ(cid:48) > 4 for the SLE parameter and κ = 16/κ(cid:48) ∈ (0, 4) for the dual parameter.

using peanosphere scaling limit results.

In this paper, we will consider random bipolar-oriented planar maps. Bipolar orientations,
especially on planar maps, have a rich combinatorial structure and numerous applications
in algorithms. For an overview of the graph theoretic perspective on bipolar orientations,
we refer to [dFdMR95] and references therein. See also [FPS09, BBMF11] and the
references therein for enumerative and bijective results for bipolar-orientated planar
maps. Random bipolar-oriented planar maps were proven in [KMSW15] to converge

in the peanosphere sense to SLEκ(cid:48)-decorated LQG for κ(cid:48) = 12 and γ =(cid:112)4/3 (or any
κ(cid:48) > 8 and corresponding γ = 4/√κ(cid:48) ∈ (0,√2) for a generalized version of the model).

A bipolar-oriented map G is a map with directed edges and a unique source and sink.
Given an instance of a bipolar-oriented map we may naturally deﬁne a tree rooted at
the sink (resp. source) (see [KMSW15] or Section 1.3 for the precise construction). The
two-dimensional random walk Z = (L,R) whose coordinates are the height functions
of these trees uniquely determines G. In [KMSW15], this random walk is shown to
converge in the scaling limit to a pair of correlated Brownian excursions with correlation
−1/2 for uniformly random bipolar-oriented k-angulations with n total edges for any
k ≥ 3, and for certain maps with mixed face sizes. Scaling limit results are also stated
for the inﬁnite-volume limit of bipolar maps (in the sense of [BS01]), in which case
the limiting object is a correlated Brownian motion. In other words, random bipolar-

oriented planar maps converge to SLE12-decorated (cid:112)4/3-LQG in the peanosphere

sense.

A bipolar-oriented map is associated with a dual bipolar-oriented map (with a dual
sink and an dual source), which can be decorated with a pair of trees rooted at the
dual sink and the dual source, respectively. It is natural to expect that the joint law of
a bipolar-oriented map and its dual converges in the scaling limit to an LQG surface

orthogonal direction to each other. In [MS13a] space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) is constructed as the
Peano curve tracing the interface between the tree of θ-angle imaginary geometry ﬂow
lines of a whole-plane Gaussian free ﬁeld and the tree of (π + θ)-angle ﬂow lines of the

decorated with two space-ﬁlling SLE12 curves η(cid:48) and(cid:101)η(cid:48) which (in some sense) travel in an
same ﬁeld. Hence one may expect that the limiting curves η(cid:48) and(cid:101)η(cid:48) are constructed from

the same Gaussian free ﬁeld in such a way that the angle between the corresponding
trees of ﬂow lines is π
2 . In [KMSW15, Conjecture 1], it is conjectured that this is
indeed the case, at least in the peanosphere sense. Our main result (which is stated
in Section 1.5 below) is a conformation of the conjecture in [KMSW15] in the case of
uniform inﬁnite-volume bipolar-oriented triangulations.

In the course of proving our main result we will also obtain a description of the θ-angle
ﬂow lines of the Gaussian free ﬁeld used to construct the space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) in terms of

the peanosphere Brownian motion for general κ(cid:48) > 4 and θ ∈ (0, π); see Section 3.

1.2 Basic notation

Here we record some basic notations which we will use throughout this paper.
Notation 1.1. For a < b ∈ R, we deﬁne the discrete intervals [a, b]Z := [a, b] ∩ Z and
(a, b)Z := (a, b) ∩ Z.
Notation 1.2. If a and b are two quantities, we write a (cid:22) b (resp. a (cid:23) b) if there is a
constant C (independent of the parameters of interest) such that a ≤ Cb (resp. a ≥ Cb).
We write a (cid:16) b if a (cid:22) b and a (cid:23) b.
Notation 1.3. If a and b are two quantities which depend on a parameter x, we write
a = ox(b) (resp. a = Ox(b)) if a/b → 0 (resp. a/b remains bounded) as x → 0 (or as
x → ∞, depending on context).
Unless otherwise stated, all implicit constants in (cid:16),(cid:22), and (cid:23) and Ox(·) and ox(·)
errors involved in the proof of a result are required to satisfy the same dependencies as
described in the statement of said result.

1.3 Background on bipolar-oriented maps

In this subsection we review some background on bipolar-oriented planar maps follow-
ing [KMSW15] and give a precise deﬁnition of the uniform inﬁnite bipolar-orientated
triangulation.

1.3.1 Bipolar-oriented planar maps

A planar map is a graph together with an embedding into the complex plane C, viewed
modulo orientation preserving homeomorphisms of C. In this paper we work on planar
maps with no self-loops, but multiple edges are allowed. A planar map is called a
triangulation if every face is incident to 3 edges. Given a planar map G, draw a dual
vertex in each face and connect a pair of dual vertices when their corresponding faces
are adjacent. This produces a new planar map which is called the dual map of G.

An orientation of a graph is a way of assigning each of its edges a direction. A vertex is
called a sink (resp. source) if there are no outgoing (resp. incoming) edges incident to
the vertex. An orientation O on a planar map is bipolar if it is acyclic and has a single
source and a single sink. An orientation on a planar map is bipolar if and only if the
map can be embedded into C in such a way that every edge is oriented upward. See
Figure 1 for an illustration. We will always assume that our bipolar-oriented planar
maps are embedded in the plane in this manner.

5

In order to make the directions of ﬂow lines in the discrete and continuum pictures
the same, when we consider an embedding of a bipolar-oriented map we will treat the
“compass” in C as being rotated clockwise by 45 degrees, so that the upward direction is
northwest and the downward direction is southeast (c.f. Remark 1.4). Hence the edges
of an embedded planar map are oriented from southeast to northwest, and it is natural
to call the sink the northwest pole and the source the southeast pole.

It is also natural to draw an unoriented edge between the two poles that divides the
outer face into a southwest pole face and a northeast pole face. The new map including
the unoriented edge between the two poles is called the augmented map of the original
map.

Figure 1: Left: A bipolar-oriented triangulation (G,O) embedded into the plane
in such a way that direction of every edge is upwards. Middle: one can associate
an east-going tree T E (shown in red) with (G,O) by cutting each edge other than
the leftmost edge leading upward from each vertex at the point where it meets that
vertex; and a west-going tree T W (shown in blue) by cutting each edge other than the
rightmost edge leading downward from each vertex at the point where it meets that
vertex. Right: the exploration path λ(cid:48) (shown in green) associated with (G,O), which

traces the interface between the trees, starting at the southeast pole and ending at the
northwest pole.

Given a bipolar orientation O on a planar map G, by reversing the direction of edges,

we obtain another bipolar orientation O on G. Let (cid:101)G be the dual map of the augmented
map of G. By declaring that each edge of the (cid:101)G travels from northeast to southwest,
we obtain a dual orientation (cid:101)O on (cid:101)G which is also bipolar. See Figure 2. The northeast

(resp. southwest) pole face of G becomes the northeast (resp. southwest) pole vertex
while the southeast (resp. northwest) pole of G becomes the southwest (resp. northeast)

G. The extra edge added to G to form the augmented map is shown as a dashed line.
The edges of the dual map are oriented leftwards, i.e. from northeast to southwest. The

trees associated with ((cid:101)G,(cid:101)cO) are the north-going tree (purple) and the south-going tree
pole face of (cid:101)G. Therefore O induces three other bipolar orientation O, (cid:101)O, (cid:101)O, each of

which also determines O.
Remark 1.4. The convention described above of assigning compass directions to the
planar map diﬀers from the one used in [KMSW15] in that our compass directions are
rotated by 45 degrees. In [KMSW15] the upward direction is deﬁned to be north, so that
the edges of G are directed from south to north. The two poles of G are interpreted as a
south pole and a north pole, and the poles of the dual map are interpreted as a west pole
and an east pole. The convention in [KMSW15] is more natural in the context of planar
maps, but we have chosen the above convention to be consistent with the continuum
picture, where we interpret the two trees describing the left and right outer boundaries
of the primal space-ﬁlling curve as west-going and east-going, respectively, rather than
northwest-going and southeast-going.

1.3.2 Bipolar-oriented map and lattice walk

Suppose (G,O) is a bipolar-oriented planar map embedded in the manner shown on
the left in Figure 1, i.e. every edge is directed in upward direction and is a straight line

segment. We will explain how to construct a pair of trees on G, which are illustrated in
the middle part of Figure 1. Given any vertex v in G other than the southeast pole, let
{ev
pv} be the set of vertices adjacent to v that are oriented toward v. We assume
that ev
pv are ordered counterclockwise, such that if v is the northwest pole then
ev
1 and ev
pv lie on the boundary of the outer face, while if v is not the northwest pole
then the next edge in the counterclockwise direction after ev
pv is an out-going edge. Now
ﬁx a small  > 0. For j ∈ [2, pv]Z, we shrink the edge ev
j by 1 − ε, i.e. we replace it
by the line segment from uv
j + (1 − )u, where uv
j is the other endpoint of ev
j .
Since O is bipolar, in every cycle at least one edge will be shrunk in this manner, so
the resulting graph has no cycles. On the other hand, every edge is still connected to
the southeast pole through edges of type ev
1. Therefore this operation produces a plane
tree rooted at the southeast pole that has the same number of edges as G. We call this
tree the east-going tree, denoted by T E, and note that it is shown in red in Figure 1.
By performing the shrinking operation on (G,O), we obtain a plane tree T W rooted at
the northwest pole, which we call the west-going tree, and which is shown in blue in
Figure 1.
For each edge e of G, there is a unique shorted path in T E (resp. T W ) from e to the
southeast pole (resp. the northwest pole). We refer to this branch as the east-going
ﬂow line (resp. west-going ﬂow line) started from e.
Suppose now (cid:96), r ∈ N0 with (cid:96) + r > 0 and that G has (cid:96) edges on its southwest boundary,
r edges on its northeast boundary (with r + (cid:96) > 0), and n ∈ N total edges. There is a
unique path path λ(cid:48) on G (a map from [0, n − 1]Z to the set of edges of G) which starts
at the leftmost outgoing edge from the southeast pole, ends at the rightmost incoming
edge to the northwest pole, and snakes in between the two trees T E and T W . This
path hits every edge of G exactly once, and jumps across each face of G exactly once.
It is shown in green in Figure 1.
For i ∈ [0, n − 1]Z let Li (resp. Ri) be the distance from the top (resp. bottom) end
point of the edge λ(cid:48)(i) to the northwest (resp. southeast) pole in the tree T W (resp.
T E). We deﬁne

Zi := (Li,Ri).

As explained in [KMSW15], (Zi)i∈[0,n−1]Z is a lattice walk on [0,∞)Z × [0,∞)Z from
((cid:96) − 1, 0) to (0, r − 1). For i ∈ [0, n − 2]Z, if λ(cid:48)(i) is the westmost incoming edge to
some vertex, then Zi+1 − Zi = (−1, 1). Otherwise, there must be a face f containing
λ(cid:48)(i) such that the terminal endpoint of λ(cid:48)(i) is the westmost vertex of f , and the edge
λ(cid:48)(i) is “shrunk” in the construction of T E. In this case the next step corresponds to
λ(cid:48) traversing f . If f has (cid:96)f edges on the southwest side and rf edges on the northeast
side, then Zi+1 − Zi = ((cid:96)f − 1, 1 − rf ).
As shown in [KMSW15, Theorem 2], the map (G,O) (cid:55)→ Z is a bijection. We omit
the details of the inverse bijection and refer to [KMSW15, Section 2], where (G,O) is
dynamically recovered from Z by the so-called sewing procedure. Consequently, one
can sample a random bipolar-oriented map (G,O) with (cid:96) southwest boundary edges, r

8

northeast boundary edges, and n total edges by ﬁrst sampling a random walk Z with
certain allowed step sizes which starts ((cid:96) − 1, 0), at ends at (0, r − 1), and stays in
the closed ﬁrst quadrant. We will be particularly interested in the case of a uniformly
random bipolar-oriented triangulation. In this case, the corresponding walk can be

Then the law of Z is the same as the conditional law of Z
closed ﬁrst quadrant and ends at (0, r − 1).
Remark 1.5. Note that the coordinates of the random walk are interchanged as compared
to the convention applied in [KMSW15], i.e., that paper considers a random walk from
(0, (cid:96) − 1) to (r − 1, 0) with iid steps chosen from {(0, 1), (−1, 0), (1,−1)}. We choose
the above convention to be consistent with our continuum convention, where the ﬁrst
(resp. second) coordinate of the walk corresponds to the length of the left (resp. right)
frontier of the space-ﬁlling curve.

1.3.3 Bipolar-oriented inﬁnite triangulation

The concept of a uniform inﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulation is best understood by
considering a local limit of ﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulations. Given planar maps
G and G(cid:48) with oriented root edges e and e(cid:48), respectively, the Benjamini-Schramm
distance [BS01] from (G, e) to (G(cid:48), e(cid:48)) is deﬁned by

dloc = inf{2−r : r ∈ N, Br(e; G) (cid:39) Br(e

(cid:48); G

(cid:48))},

where Br(e; G) is the ball of radius r centered at the terminal endpoint of e in the graph

distance of G, and Br(e; G) (cid:39) Br(e(cid:48); G(cid:48)) means that the two balls are isomorphic. Then

dloc deﬁnes a metric on the space of ﬁnite rooted planar maps. Let M be the Cauchy
completion of the space of ﬁnite rooted planar maps under this metric. Elements in
M which are not ﬁnite rooted maps are called inﬁnite rooted planar maps. For more
background on inﬁnite rooted planar maps, we refer to the foundational paper [BS01].
For n ∈ N let (Gn,On) be sampled uniformly from the set of all bipolar-oriented
triangulations for which Gn has 1 northeast boundary edge, 2 southwest boundary
edges, and n total edges. Let Z n be the lattice walk obtained when applying the bijection
described in Section 1.3.2 to (Gn,On). Then Z n is uniform among all lattice walks in
[0,∞)2
Z of duration n from from (1, 0) to (0, 0), with steps in {(1, 0), (0,−1), (−1, 1)}.
According to [KMSW15, Corollary 7], the number of such walks is c(1 + on(1))n−4 · 33n.

We claim that if we uniformly choose an edge en from Gn, whose direction is inherited
from On, then (Gn, en) weakly converges to a probability measure on M. The argument
is almost identical to the proof for the case of critical FK-weighted planar maps
in [She16b, Section 4.2] and the more detailed explanation in [Che15]. Therefore we
only brieﬂy explain the argument. In light of the bijection, uniformly choosing an edge

9

in Gn amounts to uniformly picking a time in ∈ {0,··· , n − 1} and re-centering Z n at
in. Since the probability that the lattice walk stays in the ﬁrst quadrant and returns to
the origin at time n is c(1 + on(1))n−4, Cramer’s theorem (applied as in [She16b, Section
4.2]) implies that for each ﬁxed N ∈ N the laws of the re-centered walks restricted to
[−N, N ] converge in the total variation distance to a bi-inﬁnite simple random walk
Z with steps uniformly chosen from {(1, 0), (0,−1), (−1, 1)}. The sewing procedure
of [KMSW15, Section 2.2] which recovers (Gn,On) from Z n is a local operation. Hence
the sewing procedure also makes sense for Z and we can recover an inﬁnite rooted
oriented triangulation (G,O, e) of the plane such that (G, e) is the Benjamini-Schramm
limit of (Gn, en).
The limiting object (G,O, e) is called the uniform inﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulation.
We note that O is almost surely an acyclic orientation with no sinks and sources, since
the two poles are at ∞. The orientation O gives rise to a pair of trees on G, in the same
manner as in the ﬁnite-volume case (see Figure 1). We deﬁne the discrete east-going and
west-going ﬂow lines of (G,O) started from any edge e of G to be the branches of these
two trees. These ﬂow lines are paths from e to ∞. There is a bi-inﬁnite space-ﬁlling
exploration path λ(cid:48) (a map from Z to the edge set of G) which snakes between the two
trees, in direct analogy to the ﬁnite-volume case. The path λ(cid:48) satisﬁes λ(cid:48)(0) = e and
its left and right outer boundaries at the time it hits any edge e of G are given by the
east-going and west-going ﬂow lines started from e.

By clockwise rotation of 90◦, we obtain a dual bipolar-oriented map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e) which is
((cid:101)Gn, (cid:101)On,(cid:101)en). Here(cid:101)e (resp. (cid:101)en) is the edge of the dual map which crosses e (resp. en).
The bipolar-oriented map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e) is associated with a north-going and south-going
path(cid:101)λ(cid:48)) as well as a bi-inﬁnite lattice walk (cid:101)Z = ((cid:101)L, (cid:101)R). Although (cid:101)Z is not a simple
random walk, in Section 2.2 we will show that (cid:101)Z converges to a Brownian motion in
the scaling limit. The remainder of the paper will be devoted to proving that (Z, (cid:101)Z)

jointly converges after rescaling.

1.4 Background on SLE and LQG

1.4.1 Liouville quantum gravity and the quantum cone

Let γ ∈ (0, 2). A quantum surface [DS11, She16a, DMS14] is a certain equivalence class
of pairs (D, h), where D is a planar domain and h is an instance of some variant of the
Gaussian free ﬁeld (GFF) on D. See [She07, SS13, MS16a, DMS14] for an introduction
to the GFF, and see [MS13a, Section 2.2] for an introduction to the whole-plane GFF.
As explained in the introduction, the quantum surface (D, h) is heuristically speaking
the manifold conformally parameterized by D with metric tensor given by eγh(z) times
the Euclidean one. Since h is a distribution and not a function this metric tensor does

10

not make literal sense, but it has been made sense of as a random area measure. More
precisely, it is proven in [DS11] that given an instance h of a GFF one can a.s. deﬁne
an area measure µh as the weak limit of γ2/2eγh(z)dz as  → 0, where dz is Lebesgue
measure on D, and h(z) is the mean value of h on the circle ∂B(z) (as deﬁned in
[DS11]). One may deﬁned a length measure νh on certain curves in D (including ∂D and
SLEκ curves for κ = γ2) similarly. See [RV14] for an alternative approach of deﬁning
µh and νh.

(cid:48)

|,

Q = γ/2 + 2/γ,

(1.2)

(cid:101)h = h ◦ ϕ + Q log |ϕ

If D,(cid:101)D are planar domains, ϕ : (cid:101)D → D is a conformal map, and
then µh(A) = µ(cid:101)h(ϕ−1(A)) for all Borel sets A ⊆ D. A similar relation holds for νh and
ν(cid:101)h. We say that (D, h) and ((cid:101)D,(cid:101)h) are equivalent if they are related as in (1.2). Formally
say that (D, h, z1, ..., zk) and ((cid:101)D,(cid:101)h,(cid:101)z1, ...,(cid:101)z2) are equivalent if the condition ϕ((cid:101)zi) = zi,

a γ-Liouville quantum gravity surface is the equivalence class of surfaces as given by
this equivalence relation. A quantum surface (D, h) may have additional marked points
z1, ...zk ∈ D, k ∈ N, in which case it is denoted by (D, h, z1, ..., zk). In this case we
i = 1, ..., k, is satisﬁed in addition to (1.2).

In this paper we will be particularly interested in a particular type of quantum surface
called the α-quantum cone for α < Q. This is a doubly marked quantum surface
homeomorphic to the complex plane, and is typically represented as (C, h, 0,∞) for
some distribution h which we will now describe. By [DMS14, Lemma 4.8] it holds that
H(C) = H1(C) ⊕ H2(C), where H1(C) ⊂ H(C) is the subspace of functions which are
radially symmetric about the origin, and H2(C) ⊂ H(C) is the subspace of functions
which have mean zero about all circles centered at the origin. The distribution h can
be written as h = h† + h0, where h†
∈ H1(C) and h0 ∈ H2(C) are independent, h0
has the law of the projection of a whole-plane GFF onto H2(C), and h†(e−s) = As for
all s ∈ R, where (As)s∈R has the following law. For a standard two-sided Brownian
d= (cid:101)Bs + αs, provided (cid:101)B is conditioned such that As ≥ Qs for
motion (cid:101)B it holds that As
s < 0. The quantum cone has a special interpretation for α = γ, where the cone can be
considered as the limiting law on quantum surfaces which one would get by zooming in
near a quantum typical point of a γ-Liouville quantum gravity surface; see [DMS14,
Proposition 4.11].

1.4.2 Space-ﬁlling SLE and imaginary geometry

The Schramm-Loewner evolution [Sch00] is a conformally invariant family of random
fractal curves parameterized by κ > 0, which has three well-known phases. For κ ∈ (0, 4]
the curve is simple, for κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8) the curve hits itself and creates “bubbles” but its trace
has Lebesgue measure zero, and for κ(cid:48)
≥ 8 the curve ﬁlls space. In [MS13a, Sections 1.2.3
and 4.3] the authors construct a space-ﬁlling version of SLEκ(cid:48) for κ(cid:48) > 4, which agrees

11

with ordinary SLEκ(cid:48) for κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8) is
the same as ordinary SLEκ(cid:48), except that the curve enters each “bubble” right after it
is disconnected from the target point and ﬁlls it with a continuous space-ﬁlling loop
before it continues the exploration towards the target point.

≥ 8. Roughly speaking, space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) for κ(cid:48)

The authors of [MS13a] construct space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) by means of ﬂow lines of a Gaussian
free ﬁeld [MS16a, MS16b, MS16c, MS13a]. We will only describe the construction of
whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) from ∞ to ∞, but only minor modiﬁcations are needed
to describe space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) in general domains. Let κ = 16/κ(cid:48)

χ = 2/√κ − √κ/2,

∈ (0, 4),

(1.3)

θ ∈ [0, 2π), and let h be an instance of a whole-plane Gaussian free ﬁeld modulo a
global additive multiple of 2πχ. A ﬂow line η of h is an SLEκ-like curve for κ ∈ (0, 4)
and χ = 2/√κ − √κ/2, which is interpreted as a ﬂow line of the vector ﬁeld ei(h/χ+θ),
where χ and κ are related as in 1.3.
Flow lines of h of the same angle θ started at diﬀerent points in Q2 merge into each
other upon intersecting and form a tree [MS13a, Theorem 1.9]. The space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48)
counterﬂow line of h of angle θ is the Peano curve of this tree, i.e., it is the curve which
visits the points of C in chronological order, where a point x ∈ C is visited before a
point y ∈ C if the ﬂow line of angle θ from x merges into the ﬂow line of angle θ from y
on the left side. For any point z ∈ C it holds a.s. that the left (resp. right), respectively,
outer boundary of η(cid:48) when it ﬁrst hits z is given by the ﬂow line of h started from z
of angle θ (resp. θ − π). We refer to θ = 0 (resp. θ = π
2 ) as north (resp.
west, south, east) direction. The space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) generated from ﬂow lines of angle
θ = π
2 in the above construction has left and right boundaries given by west-going and
east-going, respectively, ﬂow lines, and travels in north direction. The space-ﬁlling
SLEκ(cid:48) generated from ﬂow lines of angle θ = π has left and right boundaries given by
south-going and north-going, respectively, ﬂow lines, and travels in west direction, i.e.,
in a direction orthogonal to the north-going SLEκ(cid:48).
Space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) has very a diﬀerent nature for κ(cid:48)
≥ 8. For t ∈ R
≥ 8 the domain η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) is a.s. homeomorphic to the upper half-plane, while
and κ(cid:48)
for κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8) the domain η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) is an inﬁnite chain of bounded simply connected
domains. The reason for this diﬀerence is that the ﬂow lines of angle θ and π − θ from
any given point z ∈ D a.s. hit each other (resp. intersect only at z) for κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8) (resp.
κ(cid:48)
≥ 8) [MS13a, Theorem 1.7]. If (η(cid:48)(t))t∈R is a space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48), τz is the ﬁrst time
η(cid:48) hits z ∈ C, and we condition on η(cid:48)((−∞, τz]), the conditional law of η(cid:48)
|[τz,∞) for
κ(cid:48)
≥ 8 is a regular chordal SLEκ(cid:48) in C \ η(cid:48)((−∞, τz]) from η(cid:48)(τz) to ∞. If κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8) the
conditional law of η(cid:48)
|[τz,∞) is that of a concatenation of independent chordal space-ﬁlling
SLEκ(cid:48) curves in each complementary connected component of η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) [DMS14,

∈ (4, 8) and κ(cid:48)

2 , θ = π, θ = 3π

Footnote 9].

It is proven in [MS13a, Theorem 1.10] that h (viewed as a distribution modulo a global
additive constant in 2πχZ) and the whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) η(cid:48) generated from

12

h (for a given angle θ) are measurable with respect to each other. Hence, given an
instance of a north-going space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) η(cid:48) there is a unique west-going space-ﬁlling

SLEκ(cid:48) (cid:101)η(cid:48) travelling in a direction orthogonal to η(cid:48).

1.4.3 The peanosphere

Let γ ∈ (0, 2), and consider a γ-quantum cone (C, h, 0,∞) decorated with an indepen-
dent whole-plane space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) curve η(cid:48) from ∞ to ∞, κ(cid:48) = 16/γ2. In [DMS14] it
is proven that (h, η(cid:48)) can be encoded in terms of a two-dimensional Brownian motion
Z = (Lt, Rt)t∈R with the following variances and covariances

Var(Lt) = α|t|, Var(Rt) = α|t|, Cov(Lt, Rt) = −α cos θ|t|,

θ =

4π
κ(cid:48) ,

(1.4)

where α is an unknown constant depending only on κ(cid:48). If η(cid:48) satisﬁes η(cid:48)(0) = 0 and is
parameterized by the area measure of the quantum cone, i.e., for any s, t ∈ R satisfying
s < t we have µh(η(cid:48)([s, t])) = t − s, it holds that Lt (resp. Rt) gives the quantum
boundary length of the left (resp. right) outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) relative to time
0. By [DMS14, Theorem 1.14] the pair (L, R) almost surely determines the pair (h, η(cid:48))
(up to a rigid rotation of the complex plane about the origin), i.e., there is a measurable
a.s. deﬁned map which associates a realization of the pair (L, R) with a γ-quantum
cone decorated with an independent space-ﬁlling SLE. See Figure 3 for further details
on the construction.

1.5 Statement of main result

Consider a uniform inﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulation (G,O, e), and recall that it can
be encoded by a random walk Z = (Ln,Rn)n∈Z with iid increments in {(1, 0), (0,−1), (−1, 1)}.

Let ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e) be the dual bipolar-oriented map of (G,O, e), and let (cid:101)Z := ((cid:101)Ln, (cid:101)Rn)n∈Z
be the random walk encoding ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e). Extend L, R, (cid:101)L, and (cid:101)R to R by linear
(cid:101)Lm
where α is as in (1.4) for γ =(cid:112)4/3. The reason for including the factor (3α/2)1/2 is so
that Z m converges in law to the Brownian motion in (1.4).
Let Z = (L, R) be a two-dimensional correlated Brownian motion with correlation − 1

and variance α, where α > 0 is again as in (1.4). Recall from Section 1.4.3 that Z
encodes a(cid:112)4/3-quantum cone (C, h, 0,∞) decorated with an independent space-ﬁlling
SLE12 by the peanosphere construction. Let (cid:98)h be the instance of the whole-plane

Figure 3: An illustration of the peanosphere construction of [DMS14]. Let Z =
(Lt, Rt)t∈R be a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion. Let φ : R → (0, 1)
be an increasing, continuous and bijective function, and for any t ∈ (0, 1) deﬁne
L(cid:48)
t := φ(Lφ−1(t)). The left ﬁgure shows R(cid:48) and C − L(cid:48), where C is
t := φ(Lφ−1(t)) and R(cid:48)
a constant chosen so large that the two graphs do not intersect. We draw horizontal
lines above the graph of C − L(cid:48) and below the graph of R(cid:48), in addition to vertical lines

between the two graphs, and then we identify points which lie on the same horizontal or
vertical line segment. By Moore’s theorem [Moo28] the resulting object is a topological

sphere. The sphere is decorated with a space-ﬁlling path η(cid:48) where η(cid:48)(t) for t ∈ R is the
equivalence class of φ(t) ∈ (0, 1). The pushforward of Lebesgue measure on R induces
an area measure µ on the sphere. The resulting structure, i.e. the topological sphere
with the curve η(cid:48) and the measure µ, is called a peanosphere. It is shown in [DMS14] that
the peanosphere has a canonical embedding into C where the pushforward of µ encodes
a LQG surface known as the γ-quantum cone and η(cid:48) is an independent space-ﬁlling
SLEκ(cid:48), κ(cid:48) = 16/γ2. The right part of the ﬁgure shows a subset of the SLE-decorated
LQG surface, where the green region corresponds to points that are visited by η(cid:48) before
some time t0. The two trees are embeddings of the trees with contour functions L and
R, respectively, such that L (resp. R) encode the quantum boundary length of the left
(resp. right) frontier of η(cid:48). If Z = (Lt, Rt)t∈[0,1] was a Brownian excursion we would
obtain a ﬁnite volume LQG surface decorated with an independent space-ﬁlling SLE by
a similar procedure [DMS14, MS15c].

Gaussian free ﬁeld (modulo a global additive multiple of 2πχ, with χ as in (1.3)) such

north direction (recall Section 1.4.2), parameterized by LQG area with respect to h and

satisfying η(cid:48)(0) = 0. Let(cid:101)η(cid:48) be the SLE12 travelling in west direction which is generated
by the south-going ﬂow lines of(cid:98)h, parameterized according to LQG area with respect
to h and satisfying (cid:101)η(cid:48)(0) = 0. Let (cid:101)Z = ((cid:101)Lt,(cid:101)Rt)t∈R be the boundary length processes

of(cid:101)η(cid:48) as described in Section 1.4.3. Note that (cid:101)Z
d= Z and that Z and (cid:101)Z a.s. determine
Theorem 1.6. Let Z m,(cid:101)Z m and Z,(cid:101)Z be as deﬁned above. Then the following conver-

gence holds in law for the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets:

(Z m,(cid:101)Z m) d→ (Z, 3(cid:101)Z).

Remark 1.7. In Theorem 1.6, the second (west-going) Peano curve under consideration
is deﬁned in terms of from the north-going and south-going trees on the dual bipolar-

of the original east-going and west-going trees. If we perform this construction for the

oriented map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e). There is also another natural way to deﬁne a west-going Peano

curve associated with a bipolar-oriented map (G,O, e). Namely, in Figure 1 we deﬁne a
new red tree (the primal north-going tree) rooted at the source by cutting each edge other
than the rightmost edge leading upward from each vertex and deﬁne a new blue tree (the
primal south-going tree) rooted at the sink by cutting each edge except for the leftmost
edge leading downward from each vertex. Let ˙λ(cid:48) be the Peano curve associated with
these two new trees (deﬁned in an analogous manner to the original Peano curve λ(cid:48)).
Then ˙λ(cid:48) travels in the west direction, rather than the north direction. We can encode
(G,O, e) by a diﬀerent random walk ˙Z = ( ˙L, ˙R) by using these two new trees instead
uniform inﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulation, then the walk ˙Z is a bi-inﬁnite random
walk with the same law as the original walk Z. It will be shown in Proposition 2.3 that
if we deﬁne ˙Z m as in (1.5), then the scaling limit of
˙Z m is the same as the scaling limit
of the re-scaled walk (cid:101)Z m of Theorem 1.6, up to a constant factor. In particular, one has
with (Z,(cid:101)Z) as in Theorem 1.6. This is the version of Theorem 1.6 which is conjectured

(Z m, ˙Z m) d→ (Z,(cid:101)Z),

Remark 1.8. In this paper we consider only the case of uniform inﬁnite-volume bipolar-
oriented triangulations. The third author and Yiting Li are currently working on a
new paper which extends Theorem 1.6 to the case of k-angulations for k ≥ 4 and
bipolar-oriented maps with mixed face size as considered in [KMSW15]) and the case
of ﬁnite-volume bipolar-oriented maps. Under an appropriate re-scaling, in the former

case the limiting object is the same pair (Z,(cid:101)Z) appearing in Theorem 1.6, except with (cid:101)Z
a(cid:112)4/3-LQG sphere (instead of a(cid:112)4/3-LQG cone) decorated by the north-going and
west-going space-ﬁlling SLE12 curves η(cid:48) and (cid:101)η(cid:48) considered above, which can be encoded

by a pair of two-dimensional correlated Brownian excursions, each with correlation
−1/2; see [MS15c]. Most of the arguments in this paper still apply in the case of general
k-angulations. To generalize our result to this case one would need to extend the exact

15

combinatorial results found in Sections 2 and 5.1 to the case where the random walk
Z has a diﬀerent step distribution. We expect that such a ﬁnite-volume version of
our result can be deduced from the inﬁnite-volume case using local absolute continuity
and conditioning arguments similar to those found in [MS15c] together with local limit
theorems and arguments similar to those found in [DW15, GS15a, GS15b].

1.6 Outline

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we prove some

properties of the dual bipolar-oriented map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e) of a uniform inﬁnite bipolar-
oriented triangulation using combinatorial techniques. In particular, we describe the
discrete north-going and south-going ﬂow lines (i.e. the branches of the two trees which
decorate the dual map) in terms of the primal walk Z; and we prove that the dual walk
(cid:101)Z converges in law to a Brownian motion in the scaling limit. In Section 3, we describe
the joint law of the peanosphere Brownian motion Z and the set of times when the
space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) curve η(cid:48) crosses the θ-angle ﬂow line of the GFF used to construct
η(cid:48) in terms of a certain Poisson point process of conditioned Brownian motions. This is
done for general values of κ(cid:48) > 4 and θ ∈ (−π/2, π/2), although we only need the case
when κ(cid:48) = 12 and θ = 0 for the proof of Theorem 1.6. In Section 4 we prove that the
joint law of Z and the random walk X which encodes the excursions of Z away from a
north-going discrete ﬂow line, appropriately rescaled, converges to the joint law of their
continuum counterparts. In Section 5, we conclude the proof of Theorem 1.6.

2 Properties of the dual map

2.1 Discrete decomposition of contour functions

Let N0 := N ∪ {0}. In this section we deﬁne random one-dimensional paths X =
(Xn)n∈N0 and l = (ln)n∈N0 which will be discrete processes adapted to the ﬁltration
generated by the random walk Z = (L,R) which encodes a uniform inﬁnite bipolar-
oriented triangulation (G,O, e). Let λ(cid:48) be the space-ﬁlling exploration path of (G,O, e)
and let λN be the north-going discrete ﬂow line started from λ(cid:48)(0) (i.e. the inﬁnite
branch of the dual north-going tree which begins at the edge of the dual map (cid:101)G which
crosses λ(cid:48)(0)); recall Section 1.3.2.
For each time n ∈ N0 the path λ(cid:48) is either in an east excursion or in a west excursion.
We are in a west excursion at time n if both end-points of the edge λ(cid:48)(n) edge are on
the west side of λN , and we are in an east excursion at time n if at least one end-point
of the corresponding edge is on the east side of λN . Note that this description is not
symmetric in east excursions and west excursions. We have chosen this deﬁnition of
east and west excursions since it makes the description of the times we are in an east

Proof. Consider an edge of the bipolar map which is crossed by λN . We say that a
time n ∈ N is of type (a) (resp. type (b)) if the edge λ(cid:48)(n) crosses the north-going ﬂow
line λN and the edge λ(cid:48)(n + 1) is on the west side of λN (resp. either crosses λN or is
on the east side of λN ). See Figure 5.
For any k ∈ N it follows by the deﬁnition of N W
k − 1 is a time of type (a). By
deﬁnition of N E

tree has decreased by one, or equivalently the ﬁrst time X hits 0. Furthermore, no
edges visited by λ(cid:48) during [N W
k+1) are crossed by λN , which is consistent with the
formula for l in the statement of the lemma since X > 0 throughout the interval.
By deﬁnition of N W
we have N W

in the west-going tree as λ(cid:48)(n(cid:48)), since the westernmost vertex of these two edges is
the same. See Figure 5(b). Hence it holds that Ln(cid:48) = LN E
and Xn(cid:48) = XN E

2.2 Equivalence of west-going Peano curve in primal and dual

map

There are two natural west-going Peano curves associated with an instance of an inﬁnite

a constant). Once we have proved our main result Theorem 1.6, this will imply a version

volume bipolar-oriented map: one Peano curve(cid:101)λ(cid:48) tracing the interface between the north-
going and south-going tree in the dual map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e), and one Peano curve ˙λ(cid:48) tracing
the interface between the north-going and south-going tree in the primal map (G,O, e).
See Remark 1.7. In this section we will prove that the two discrete random walks (cid:101)Z and
˙Z encoding each of these Peano curves converge jointly to the same scaling limit (up to
of Theorem 1.6 with the random walk ˙Z instead of (cid:101)Z. The random walk (cid:101)Z = ((cid:101)L, (cid:101)R)
was deﬁned in Section 1.5, and encodes the west-going Peano curve (cid:101)λ(cid:48) : Z → E((cid:101)G)
in the dual map. The random walk ˙Z = ( ˙L, ˙R) is the corresponding random walk
for ˙λ(cid:48), i.e.,
˙R) encodes the height in the south-going (resp. north-going) tree
in the primal map relative to time 0. Assume ˙λ(cid:48) is normalized such that (cid:101)λ(cid:48)(0) =(cid:101)e
and ˙λ(cid:48)(0) = e. The random walk ˙Z has iid increments in {(−1, 1), (1, 0), (0,−1)} by
symmetry with the north-going Peano curve λ(cid:48) in (G,O, e). Extend ˙Z to a function
on R by linear interpolation, and for each m ∈ Z and t ∈ R deﬁne the renormalized

WNSE(a)(b)Proposition 2.3. The pair ((cid:101)Z m, ˙Z m) converges in law as m → ∞ to (3Z, Z), where

Z is the two-dimensional correlated Brownian motion considered in Theorem 1.6.

The proof of the proposition will be based on several basic lemmas. Recall that each
edge around a face in the primal map is on either the left (equivalently, southwest) side
of the face or on the right (equivalently, northeast) side of the face. Therefore, given
a face of the primal map, the lowest left edge and the highest right edge around the
face are well-deﬁned. Similarly, the edges around a face in the dual map are on either
the upper (equivalently, northwest) or lower (equivalently, southeast) side of the face,
and the leftmost lower edge and the rightmost upper edge around the face are both
well-deﬁned.

We state the following lemma for general inﬁnite volume bipolar oriented maps, i.e., we
do not restrict ourselves to triangulations as in the remainder of the paper. Note that
the lemma also holds for ﬁnite maps.

Lemma 2.4. Consider an inﬁnite volume bipolar-oriented map (G,O, e) and its dual
curves (resp. height function of south-going and north-going trees) in the primal and
dual map. Then the following holds:

((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e), and let ˙λ(cid:48) and(cid:101)λ(cid:48) (resp.
˙Z and (cid:101)Z) denote the corresponding west-going Peano
(i) The path ˙λ(cid:48) (resp.(cid:101)λ(cid:48)) always traverses an edge following its orientation, i.e. from

southeast to northwest or, equivalently, in upwards direction (resp. from northeast
to southwest or, equivalently, from right to left).

(ii) The path ˙λ(cid:48) always crosses a face from top to bottom, and the last (resp. ﬁrst)
edge visited before (resp. after) the face is crossed is the lowest (resp. highest)

from left to right, and the last (resp. ﬁrst) edge visited before (resp. after) the face
is crossed is the leftmost (resp. rightmost) edge on the lower (resp. upper) side of
the face.

edge on the right (resp. left) side of the face. The path(cid:101)λ(cid:48) always crosses a face
(iii) The Peano curves ˙λ(cid:48) and(cid:101)λ(cid:48) always have the north-going (resp. south-going) tree
(iv) A step of the walk ˙Z (resp. (cid:101)Z) is equal to (−1, 1) iﬀ the Peano curve does not

cross a face of the primal (resp. dual) map in this step.

on their right (resp. left) side.

Proof. The lemma is immediate from the bijection described in [KMSW15, Sections
2.1 and 2.2].

The following lemma says that the west-going Peano curves ˙λ(cid:48) and(cid:101)λ(cid:48) visit the edges of

the map in the same order. We state the result for general primal and dual bipolar-
oriented maps, i.e., we do not restrict ourselves to the case when the primal map is

20

Lemma 2.5. Consider the setting described in Lemma 2.4. For any n ∈ Z it holds

We consider two cases separately: (a) Z1 (cid:54)= (−1, 1), (b) Z1 = (−1, 1).
First assume case (a) occurs. By Lemma 2.4(iv) the Peano curve ˙λ(cid:48) crosses a face f

edge on the left (resp. right) side of f . By deﬁnition of the dual north-going (resp.
south-going) tree this implies that there is a branch in this tree for which ˙λ(cid:48)(0) is the
direct predecessor (resp. successor) of ˙λ(cid:48)(1) when following the branch towards its root.

a triangulation. Recall that we can identify E(G) and E((cid:101)G), and therefore we may
interpret(cid:101)λ(cid:48) and ˙λ(cid:48) to have the same range.
that ˙λ(cid:48)(n) =(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(n).
Proof. By induction and recentering of the map it is suﬃcient to prove that(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(1) = ˙λ(cid:48)(1).
in the ﬁrst step, so by Lemma 2.4(ii)(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(1) (resp.(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(0)) is the lowest (resp. highest)
Hence, by deﬁnition of the Peano curve and Lemma 2.4(iii), the dual Peano curve(cid:101)λ(cid:48)
will visit ˙λ(cid:48)(1) right after ˙λ(cid:48)(0), so(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(1) = ˙λ(cid:48)(1).
the dual Peano curve(cid:101)λ(cid:48) crosses the face in the dual graph corresponding to v in this

Now assume case (b) occurs. By Lemma 2.4(iv) the primal Peano curve ˙λ(cid:48) crosses a
vertex v ∈ V (G) in the ﬁrst time step. The ﬁrst step of our proof will be to show that
time step. Since (b) occurs there is a branch in the north-going (resp. south-going)
primal tree for which ˙λ(cid:48)(0) is a direct predecessor (resp. successor) of ˙λ(cid:48)(1). By deﬁnition
of the north-going (resp. south-going) tree this implies that the edge e1 (resp. e0) next
to ˙λ(cid:48)(1) (resp.
˙λ(cid:48)(0)) in clockwise order around v has v as its northernmost (resp.
southernmost) end-point. Since ˙λ(cid:48)(0) (resp. ˙λ(cid:48)(1)) has v as its northernmost (resp.

˙λ(cid:48)(0) and e0 (resp. ˙λ(cid:48)(1) and e1), is the leftmost (resp. rightmost) vertex on the face of

southernmost) end-point this implies that the vertex in (cid:101)G which is an end-point of both
(cid:101)G corresponding to v. This implies that(cid:101)λ(cid:48) will traverse this face right after visiting
(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(0) = ˙λ(cid:48)(0) = 0. Furthermore,(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(1) is the rightmost edge on the upper side of this
face, i.e.,(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(1) = ˙λ(cid:48)(1).

The following lemma states that the north-going trees in the primal and dual map
are similar, in the sense that the primal and dual branches started from a given
edge trace each other closely, and that the branches started from two diﬀerent edges
merge approximately simultaneously for the primal and dual tree. Contrary to the
lemmas above, we assume G is a triangulation as in the remainder of the paper. Let

considerations, and the deﬁnition of dual and primal north-going ﬂow lines. See
Figure 2.2.

Proof of Proposition 2.3. The renormalized random walk ˙Z m converges in law to Z by
Donsker’s theorem and symmetry between the west-going and north-going Peano curve
in the primal map. By Lemma 2.5 and re-rooting invariance in law of (G,O, e), the law
describes the north-going ﬂow line in the map encoded by the time reversal of (R, L),

of ( ˙Z,(cid:101)Z) is invariant under recentering. Furthermore, since the time reversal of ( ˙L,(cid:101)L)
which is equal in distribution to (L, R), it follows that the time reversal of ( ˙L,(cid:101)L) is
equal in law to ( ˙R,(cid:101)R). Hence it is suﬃcient to prove that for any T,  > 0,

as in [MS16a, MS16b, MS16c, MS13a]. Let(cid:98)h be a whole-plane GFF, viewed modulo a
global additive multiple of 2πχ, as in [MS13a]. Let η(cid:48) be the north-going whole-plane
space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) curve from ∞ to ∞ which is constructed from the π/2-angle ﬂow
lines of(cid:98)h as in Section 1.4.2. Recall that a.s. for each w ∈ C the left and right outer
boundaries of η(cid:48) stopped at the ﬁrst time it hits w are equal to the images of the west-
w of(cid:98)h started from w, respectively (i.e. with angles
and east-going ﬂow lines ηE
−π/2 and π/2).
Let (C, h, 0,∞) be a γ-quantum cone independent from(cid:98)h (equivalently, independent
from η(cid:48)). We take η(cid:48) to be parameterized by γ-quantum mass with respect to h and to
be normalized so that η(cid:48)(0) = 0. For t ∈ R, let Lt (resp. Rt) be the γ-quantum length of
the left (resp. right) outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, t]) with respect to h. Let Zt := (Lt, Rt),

where α > 0 is the unknown constant appearing in (1.4).

Fix θ ∈ (−π/2, π/2) and let ηθ be the ﬂow line of(cid:98)h started from 0 with angle θ. In
subsequent sections we will only be interested in the case when κ(cid:48) = 12 and θ = 0, but
the general case requires only slightly more work so we treat it here. For t ≥ 0, we say
that η(cid:48) crosses ηθ at time t if for each  > 0, there exists s1, s2 ∈ (t − , t + ) such that
η(cid:48)(s1) and η(cid:48)(s2) lie on opposite sides of ηθ. We deﬁne

A :=(cid:8)t ≥ 0 : η

(cid:48) crosses ηθ at time t(cid:9) .

24

Remark 3.1. If κ(cid:48) and θ are such that η(cid:48) a.s. crosses ηθ whenever it hits ηθ (which
holds in particular when κ(cid:48)
≥ 12 and θ = 0 [MS13a, Theorem 1.7]) then A = (η(cid:48))−1(ηθ).
In general, however, it is possible for η(cid:48) to hit ηθ without crossing it. Since the left and
right boundaries of η(cid:48) stopped when it hits any z ∈ C are given by the ﬂow lines of(cid:101)h
angle ±π/2, this will be the case if and only if κ(cid:48) and θ are such that the θ-angle ﬂow
lines of(cid:101)h can hit either the π/2 or −π/2-angle ﬂow lines of(cid:101)h. As explained in [MS13a,
Section 3.6], this is the case if and only if |θ − π/2| ∧ |θ + π/2| < πκ/(4 − κ), where κ
is as in (3.1).

The goal of this section is to describe the joint law of the pair (Z,A). We know
from [DMS14, Theorem 1.14] that Z a.s. determines h and η(cid:48) (modulo rotation) and
from [MS13a, Theorems 1.2 and 1.16] that η(cid:48) a.s. determines ηθ. Hence the set A

is a.s. equal to some deterministic functional of Z. We are not able to describe this
functional explicitly. Instead, we will give an indirect description of the joint law of
(Z,A) by constructing this pair simultaneously from a certain Poisson point process of
conditioned Brownian paths. See Figure 7 for an illustration.

Proposition 3.2. For s ≥ 0, let τs (resp. (cid:101)τs) be the smallest t ≥ s (resp. the largest
t ≤ s) for which t ∈ A. Also let Es be the event that η(cid:48)(s) lies to the left of ηθ. For
s ≥ 0, let

Xs := (Rs − R(cid:101)τs)1Es − (Ls − L(cid:101)τs)1Ec

s ,

s ≥ 0.

(3.3)

There is a deterministic constant p ∈ (0, 1), depending only on θ and κ(cid:48) and equal to
1/2 for θ = 0 such that the following is true. The function |X| has the law of α1/2 times
a standard reﬂected Brownian motion (where α is as in (3.2)) and

A = X

−1(0) = {τs,(cid:101)τs : s ≥ 0} .

Brownian motion with covariance matrix Σ started from 0 conditioned to stay in the

Furthermore, if we condition on A, then the conditional law of the excursions {(Z −
Z(cid:101)τs)|[(cid:101)τs,τs] : s ≥ 0} is that of a collection of independent random paths, each of which is
independently equal with probability p to a Brownian motion with covariance matrix
Σ started from 0 conditioned to stay in the upper half plane for τs −(cid:101)τs units of time
and to exit the upper half plane at time τs −(cid:101)τs; and is equal with probability 1 − p to a
right half plane for τs −(cid:101)τs units of time and to exit the right half plane at time τs −(cid:101)τs.

The process X of (3.3) is a continuum analogue of the process X deﬁned in Section 2.1.
Proposition 3.2 implies that in the case when θ = 0 (so p = 1/2), the process X is
obtained from |X| by independently multiplying by ±1 with equal probability on each
of its excursions away from 0. Therefore X has the law of α1/2 times a standard linear
Brownian motion in this case. In general, X has the law of a skew Brownian motion
with parameter p [Lej06].

We do not know the value of the constant p except in the case when θ = 0.

Figure 7: An illustration of the objects involved in the statement of Proposition 3.2.
The curve η(cid:48) traces the green region, then the gray region, then the blue region. For
next time that η(cid:48) crosses ηθ after time s, equivalently (by Lemma 3.6) the next time

s > 0, (cid:101)τs is the last time that η(cid:48) crosses the ﬂow line ηθ before time s, and τs is the
after s at which η(cid:48) hits η(cid:48)((cid:101)τs). Proposition 3.2 tells us that the set A of times τs and(cid:101)τs

for s ≥ 0 has the same law as the zero set of a standard linear Brownian motion and
that the excursions of Z away from this set are certain conditioned correlated Brownian
motions.

In light of Proposition 3.2, one can deﬁne the local time of Z at A, which we call {(cid:96)t}t≥0,
to be 1/2 times the local time of the reﬂected Brownian motion |X| as in (3.3) at zero
(the reason for the factor of 1/2 is so that (cid:96)t is the local time of X at 0 when θ = 0, in
which case X is a Brownian motion). This local time has a natural interpretation in
terms of h and ηθ.
Proposition 3.3. Let {(cid:96)t}t≥0 be 1/2 times the local time of |X| at 0, as above There
is a deterministic constant c > 0 (possibly depending on θ and κ(cid:48)) such that a.s. for
each t ≥ 0, (cid:96)t = cνh(ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([0, t])).

We will eventually show via a rather indirect argument that the constant c of Proposi-
tion 3.3 is equal to 2 when κ(cid:48) = 12 and θ = 0 (see Corollary 5.6 below). It remains an
open problem to compute c for other (κ(cid:48), θ) pairs.
It is not immediately obvious that Proposition 3.2 uniquely characterizes the joint law
of the pair (Z,A). What is obvious is that Proposition 3.2 gives a complete description
of the law of the process

Ws = (W L

s ) := Zs − Z(cid:101)τs,

∀s ≥ 0,

ηθηWηEη0(0)=0η0(τs)=η0(˜τs)η0(s)which encodes the excursions of Z away from A. Note that W is a.s. continuous except
at the times τs for s ≥ 0 (where it has jump discontinuities in one coordinate). It turns
out that W actually determines Z|[0,∞).
Proposition 3.4. In the setting of Proposition 3.2, it holds for each t ∈ [0,∞] that the
Brownian motion Z|[0,t] (equivalently the quantum surface obtained by restricting h to
η(cid:48)([0, t])) is a.s. determined by the process W|[0,t].

The remainder of this section is structured as follows. In Section 3.1, we prove some
lemmas based on the theory of imaginary geometry [MS16a, MS16b, MS16c, MS13a]

(using the results of the preceding subsection and of [DMS14]) that the times τs of
Proposition 3.2 are renewal times for Z, in the sense that each τs is a stopping time for

which describe the interaction of(cid:98)h and the curves η(cid:48) and ηθ. In Section 3.2, we prove
Z and the joint conditional law of (Z − Zτs)|[τs,∞) and the part of ηθ not hit by η(cid:48) before
time τs (the latter viewed as a curve on a certain quantum surface) is the same as the
joint law of Z|[0,∞) and ηθ. In Section 3.3, we conclude the proof of Propositions 3.2
and 3.3. In Section 3.4, we prove Proposition 3.4 via an argument which will also be
relevant in Section 4.

3.1 Imaginary geometry lemmas

In this subsection we will prove some lemmas about the interactions between(cid:98)h, η(cid:48), and ηθ

which are straightforward consequences of the results of [MS16a, MS16b, MS16c, MS13a].
These lemmas will eventually be used for the proofs of the main results of this section.
In order to give precise statements of our results in the regime when η(cid:48) can hit ηθ
without crossing it, we need the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.5. We say that a point a ∈ ηθ is covered by η(cid:48) at time t if there is a
sequence of points an ∈ ηθ such that an → a and each an lies in the interior of η(cid:48)([0, t]).
The set of points of ηθ which are covered by η(cid:48) at time t is a segment of the curve ηθ,
as the following lemma demonstrates.

Lemma 3.6. For a ∈ ηθ, let ta be the inﬁmum of the times t ≥ 0 at which a is covered
by η(cid:48). Then a.s., for each a, b ∈ ηθ, we have ta < tb if and only if ηθ hits a before b.
Proof. For w ∈ C, let τw be the ﬁrst time that η(cid:48) hits w. Also let ηE
w be the
ﬂow lines of(cid:98)h started from w with angles −π/2 and π/2, as above.

Suppose by way of contradiction that with positive probability, there exist points
a, b ∈ ηθ such that ηθ hits a before b but tb < ta. Then we can ﬁnd a deterministic
w ∈ Q2 such that with positive probability, there exists such an a and b satisfying

w and ηW

27

tb < τw < ta (so in particular b is covered by η(cid:48)([0, τw])) Let Ew be the event that this
is the case.
Let (cid:96)L (resp. (cid:96)R) be the left (resp. right) boundary of η(cid:48)([0, τw]), so that (cid:96)L (resp. (cid:96)R)
0 and ηE
is the concatenation of the segments of the ﬂow lines ηW
w )
traced before these ﬂow lines merge. By Deﬁnition 3.5, on Ew we can ﬁnd b(cid:48)
∈ ηθ
which lies in the interior of η(cid:48)([0, τw]) and a ∈ ηθ with ta < τw such that a is hit by ηθ
before b(cid:48). The curves (cid:96)L and (cid:96)R do not cross one another, share the same endpoints,
disconnect b(cid:48) from ∞, and do not disconnect a from ∞. It follows that ηθ must cross
0 , it follows that
w at least twice. By [MS13a, Theorem 1.9], two ﬂow lines
of(cid:98)h with diﬀerent angles a.s. do not cross more than once, so we obtain the desired

one of these two curves at least twice. Since ηθ does not cross ηW
ηθ must cross either ηW

w (resp. ηE

Ft := σ(η

|(−∞,t],(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,t]), h),

In the above deﬁnition we view η(cid:48)

|(−∞,t] as a curve embedded in the complex plane with
a certain parameterization of time, and(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,t]) as a random distribution restricted
to a given domain of the complex plane (by contrast, in Section 3.2 we will often view
the restriction of η(cid:48) as a curve on top of a quantum surface, hence we view it as a
curve modulo conformal transformations). We will show in Lemma 3.8 below that
the deﬁnition of Ft is unchanged if we remove one of η(cid:48)
|(−∞,t] or(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,t]), but until
this is established we need to include both in the deﬁnition of Ft. In what follows, we
recall the deﬁnition of a local set of a Gaussian free ﬁeld, which ﬁrst appeared in [SS13,
Lemma 3.9].

Lemma 3.7. Let T be a stopping time for the ﬁltration (Ft) of (3.5). If κ(cid:48)
≥ 8, then
the conditional law of(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞)) given FT is that of a zero-boundary GFF on η(cid:48)([T,∞))
plus the harmonic function which equals λ(cid:48) + χ arg φ(cid:48) on the left boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, T ])
and −λ(cid:48) + χ arg φ(cid:48) on the right boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]), where λ(cid:48), χ are as in (3.1)
and φ : η(cid:48)([T,∞)) → H is a conformal map which takes η(cid:48)(T ) to 0 and ∞ to ∞, and
we deﬁne arg φ(cid:48) such that it varies continuously. Furthermore, the conditional law of
η(cid:48)
|[T,∞) given FT is that of the 0-angle space-ﬁlling counterﬂow line of(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞)) from
η(cid:48)(T ) to ∞.
∈ (4, 8), let U be the set of connected components of the interior of η(cid:48)([T,∞)).
If κ(cid:48)
For U ∈ U, let xU (resp. yU ) be the last (resp. ﬁrst) point of ∂U hit by η(cid:48)
|(−∞,0]. Then
for U ∈ U, the conditional law of(cid:98)h|U given FT is that of a zero-boundary GFF on U
plus the harmonic function which equals λ(cid:48) + χ arg φ(cid:48) on the left boundary of U and
−λ(cid:48) + χ arg φ(cid:48) on the right boundary of U , where φ : U → H is a conformal map which
takes xU to 0 and yU to ∞ and the left (resp. right) boundary of U is deﬁned as the
intersection of ∂U with the left (resp. right) boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]). The restrictions

line of(cid:98)h|U from xU to yU .
Proof. For z ∈ C, let Tz be the ﬁrst time that η(cid:48) hits z. By the construction of
space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) in [MS13a, Section 1.2.3], it is a.s. the case that for each z ∈ Q2, the
left and right boundaries of η(cid:48)
|(−∞,Tz] are given by the angle ±π/2-ﬂow lines ηW and
ηE of(cid:98)h started from z. By [MS13a, Theorem 1.1], it follows that the conditional law of
(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([Tz,∞)) given FTz is as described in the statement of the lemma with Tz in place of T .
1.2.3] that the conditional law of η(cid:48) given FTz is as described in the lemma with Tz in
time T for η(cid:48) which is a.s. equal to Tz for some z ∈ Q2. We obtain the statement of
the lemma when T is a general stopping time for (Ft) via a straightforward limiting
argument using [MS13b, Lemma 6.8]).

Furthermore, it follows from the construction of space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) in [MS13a, Section

place of T . From this, we obtain the statement of the lemma for a general stopping

determination is local, in the following sense.

We know from [MS13a, Theorem 1.16] that η(cid:48) and(cid:98)h a.s. determine each other. This
Lemma 3.8. Let T be a stopping time for the ﬁltration (Ft) of (3.5). Then η(cid:48)
is a.s. determined by h, η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]), and(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ]). Furthermore,(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ]) is a.s.
determined by η(cid:48)
Proof. By Lemma 3.7, the conditional law of (η(cid:48)
|[T,∞),(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞))) given FT depends only
on η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]). Hence (η(cid:48)
|[T,∞),(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞))) is conditionally independent from FT given
|(−∞,T ],(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ])) and (η(cid:48)
h and η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]), so (η(cid:48)
|[T,∞),(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞))) are conditionally
independent given h and η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]). Since h and(cid:98)h a.s. determine η(cid:48) [MS13a, Theorem
1.16], it follows that η(cid:48)
|(−∞,T ] is a.s. determined by h, η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]) and (cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ]).
Furthermore, since η(cid:48), viewed modulo monotone re-parameterization, a.s. determines
(cid:98)h [MS13a, Theorem 1.16], it follows that(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ]) is a.s. determined by η(cid:48)
Lemma 3.9. Let T be a stopping time for (Ft) such that η(cid:48)(T ) ∈ ηθ a.s. If κ(cid:48)
≥ 8,
then if we condition on FT , the curve (recall Lemma 3.6) ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)) is the θ-angle
ﬂow line of(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞)) started from η(cid:48)(T ).
If κ(cid:48)
on FT the curve ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)) is the concatenation of the θ-angle ﬂow lines of(cid:98)h|U
started from xU in the order that the sets U ∈ U are ﬁlled in by η(cid:48).

Each of η(cid:48)((−∞, T ]) and ηθ([0, σ]) are local sets for the conditional law of(cid:98)h given h,
and both are a.s. determined by h and(cid:98)h [MS16a, Theorem 1.2], [MS13a, Theorem
1.16]. By [SS13, Lemmas 3.10 and 3.11], A is a local set for (cid:98)h given h, and the
conditional law of(cid:98)h|C\A given A,(cid:98)h|A, and h is given by an independent GFF in each
expect if ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)) were a ﬂow line for the conditional law of(cid:98)h given FT . By
Lemma 3.8, FT is the same as the σ-algebra generated by(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)((−∞,T ]) and h. Therefore,
the conditional law of(cid:98)h|C\A given FT , ηθ([0, σ]), and(cid:98)h|ηθ([0,σ]) is given by an independent
GFF in each complementary connected component of C \ A, with the boundary data
we would expect if ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)) were a ﬂow line for(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([T,∞)). By approximating a
general stopping time for the conditional law of ηθ given FT by stopping times which
take on only countably many possible values and applying [MS13b, Lemma 6.8], we ﬁnd
that the same holds with σ replaced by a stopping time for the conditional law of ηθ
given FT . The statement of the lemma now follows by conformally mapping η(cid:48)([T,∞))
(if κ(cid:48)
∈ (4, 8)) to H and applying [MS16a, Theorems 1.1
and 2.4]. The condition that the image of (cid:98)ηθ ∩ U under this conformal map has a
continuous Loewner driving function follows from [MS16a, Proposition 6.12] and the
fact that ηθ cannot trace an east-going or west-going ﬂow line of(cid:98)h (which form the left

Lemma 3.10. Let t ≥ 0 and let ηθ

Proof. Let D be the interior of η(cid:48)([0,∞)) and let η(cid:48) := η(cid:48)(−·) be the time reversal of η(cid:48).
Lemma 3.7 tells us that the conditional law of(cid:98)h|D given F0 is that of an independent
which depends only on D. Furthermore, conditioned on F0, it holds that η(cid:48)
the 0-angle space-ﬁlling counterﬂow line of(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([t,∞)) from ∞ to 0 and ηθ is the θ-angle
ﬂow line of(cid:98)h|η(cid:48)([0,∞)) from 0 to ∞.
Observe that −t is the smallest time s < 0 for which D \ η(cid:48)((−∞, s]) has µh-mass at
most t, so −t is a stopping time for η(cid:48), conditioned on F0. By [MS16a, Proposition 6.1],
the conditional law of(cid:98)h|D\η(cid:48)([t,∞)) given η(cid:48)([t,∞)) and F0 is that of an independent zero-
boundary GFF in each connected component of D \ η(cid:48)([t,∞)) plus a certain harmonic
function which depends only on η(cid:48)([0, t]). Furthermore, η(cid:48)
|[−t,0] is the 0-angle space-ﬁlling
counterﬂow line of this ﬁeld started from η(cid:48)(t), and ηθ
t is the θ-angle ﬂow line of this
ﬁeld started from 0 (or the concatenation of the θ-angle space-ﬁlling counterﬂow lines

t are conditionally independent from F0 given η(cid:48)([0, t]).

3.2 Liouville quantum gravity lemmas
Although the Brownian motion Z a.s. determines h and η(cid:48) modulo a complex aﬃne
transformation, this Brownian motion does not determine η(cid:48) and h locally, in the sense
that if a, b ∈ R with a < b, then the “shape” of η(cid:48)([a, b]) (i.e. its embedding into C,
modulo complex aﬃne transformations) is not determined by (Z − Za)|[a,b]. However,
(Z − Za)|[a,b] a.s. determines (h|η(cid:48)([a,b]), η(cid:48)
|[a,b]) modulo the choice of embedding into C
(see Lemma 3.12 just below). To make this idea precise, we will use the following
notation.

Deﬁnition 3.11. For a, b ∈ R ∪ {−∞,∞} with a < b, let Sa,b = (η(cid:48)([a, b]), h|η(cid:48)([a,b]))
be the quantum surface obtained by restricting h to η(cid:48)([a, b]). Also let (cid:98)η(cid:48)
a,b be the curve
η(cid:48)
|[a,b], viewed as a curve on the surface Sa,b (still parameterized by γ-quantum mass).
Lemma 3.12. For a, b ∈ R∪{−∞,∞} with a < b, the pairs (Sa,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
a,b) and (Z−Za)|[a,b]

a.s. determine each other.

a,∞) are independent.

Proof. By [DMS14, Theorem 1.12 and Proposition 8.6] (applied as in the proof of
[DMS14, Lemma 9.2]), for each a ∈ R, the surfaces S−∞,a and Sa,∞ are independent
quantum wedges of weight 2− γ2/2. By the construction of space-ﬁlling SLEκ(cid:48) described
in [DMS14, Footnote 9] and conformal invariance of SLE, we ﬁnd that the pairs

−∞,a) and (Sa,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

a,∞)) a.s. determines (Z−Za)|(−∞,a]
a,∞) [DMS14,
Theorem 1.14], it follows that (Z − Za)|(−∞,a] (resp. (Z − Za)|[a,∞)) a.s. determines
a,∞)). This completes the proof in the case when either
a = −∞ or b = ∞.

−∞,a) and (Sa,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

It is clear that the pair (S−∞,a,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
−∞,a) (resp. (Sa,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
(resp. (Z − Za)|[a,∞)). Since Z a.s. determines (S−∞,a,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
(S−∞,a,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
−∞,a) (resp. (Sa,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
For a, b ∈ R with a < b, the pair (Sa,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
the pairs (S−∞,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
paragraph implies that (Sa,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
(Z − Za)|[a,∞) is the σ-algebra generated by (Z − Za)|[a,b]. Consequently, (Sa,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
a.s. determined by (Z − Za)|[a,b]. It is clear that (Sa,b,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

a,b) is a deterministic function of each of
a,∞). Consequently, the discussion in the ﬁrst
a,b) is a measurable function of each of (Z − Zb)|(−∞,b]
and (Z − Za)|[a,∞). The intersection of the σ-algebra generated by (Z − Zb)|(−∞,b] and
a,b) is
a,b) a.s. determines (Z − Za)|[a,b],

−∞,b) and (Sa,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

There is also a variant of Lemma 3.12 with a stopping time for Z in place of a
deterministic time.

(ST,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
(regarding the conditional law of (ST,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

Since Z a.s. determines (ST,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
(Z − ZT )|[T,∞). It is clear that (ST,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
for Z. Furthermore,(cid:101)τs is a.s. determined by Z|[0,s].
Proof. For s ≥ 0, let S0,s and(cid:98)η(cid:48)
of ηθ which is covered by η(cid:48) at time s, as in Lemma 3.10; and let(cid:98)ηθ
s into C, we obtain that (in the notation of Lemma 3.12),(cid:98)ηθ
0,s). By Lemma 3.12, we ﬁnd that the triple (S0,s,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
is a.s. determined by (S0,s,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
0,s,(cid:98)ηθ
is a.s. determined by Z|[0,s]. From this, it is clear that(cid:101)τs is a.s. determined by Z|[0,s].
To check that τs is a stopping time for Z, let b be the tip of ηθ
s, so that b is a point in
the outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, s]). Also let σ be the ﬁrst time after s at which η(cid:48) hits
b. Since(cid:98)ηθ
0,s is a.s. determined by Z|[0,s], it follows that σ is a stopping time for Z. We
claim that τs = σ a.s. Indeed, Lemma 3.6 implies that η(cid:48) cannot cross ηθ between time
s and time σ, for otherwise it would a.s. cover a point of ηθ which ηθ hits after b. The
Markov property of Lemma 3.7 implies that η(cid:48) a.s. hits points on the outer boundary

viewed as a curve on the surface S0,s.
By Lemma 3.10, the curve ηθ

Let r be the quantum length of the segment of the outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, s])
between η(cid:48)(s) and b. By the ﬁrst paragraph, r is a.s. determined by Z|[0,s]. By the
peanosphere construction and since τs = σ, we ﬁnd that τs is a.s. equal to the smallest
t ≥ s for which Rt − Rs = −r (resp. Lt − Ls = −r) if b lies to the right (resp. left) of
η(cid:48)(s) on the outer boundary of η(cid:48)((−∞, s]). Hence τs is a stopping time for Z.

T,∞ be given by ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)) viewed as a
T,∞ be as in Deﬁnition 3.11. Also let (cid:98)ηθ
curve on the surface ST,∞. Then the conditional law of the triple (ST,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
T,∞,(cid:98)ηθ
T,∞)
given Z|(−∞,T ] is the same as the law of (S0,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
Proof. Since Z|(−∞,t] is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra Ft of (3.5) for each
t > 0, we infer that T is also a stopping time for this latter ﬁltration. By Lemma 3.9,
the conditional joint law of the pair (η(cid:48)
|[T,∞), ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞))) given FT is the same as
the unconditional law of the pair (η(cid:48)
|[0,∞), ηθ), modulo a conformal map. By Lemma 3.8,
t ) given η(cid:48)([T,∞)), deﬁned as in (3.5), is
the conditional joint law of the pair (η(cid:48)
|[T,∞), ηθ
the same as the unconditional law of the pair (η(cid:48)
|[0,∞), ηθ), viewed as curves modulo time
parameterization and modulo a conformal map. By [MS16a, Theorem 1.2] and [MS13a,
|[T,∞) a.s. determines ηθ ∩ η(cid:48)([T,∞)). We conclude by forgetting the

3.3 Proof of Propositions 3.2 and 3.3

We are now ready to complete the proofs of the ﬁrst two main results of this section.

Proof of Proposition 3.2. By Lemma 3.6, for s ≥ 0, τs is the smallest t > s for which

By Lemma 3.14, the conditional law of Z|[s,τs] given Z|[0,s], (Z − Zτs)|[τs,∞) and Es is
the same as the law of a Brownian motion with covariance matrix Σ started from Zs
conditioned on the event that its second coordinate hits Rτs for the ﬁrst time at time

η(cid:48)(t) = η(cid:48)((cid:101)τs). By the peanosphere construction (c.f. the proof of Lemma 3.14), if Es
occurs, then Rt ≥ R(cid:101)τs for t ∈ [(cid:101)τs, τs] and τs is the smallest t > s for which Rt = Rτs.
τs. For any t ∈ ((cid:101)τs, τs), we have(cid:101)τt =(cid:101)τs and τt = τs. By taking a limit as t →(cid:101)τs and
applying the above conditioning result, we ﬁnd that the conditional law of (Z−Z(cid:101)τs)|[(cid:101)τs,τs]
given Z[0,(cid:101)τs], (Z − Zτs)|[τs,∞), and Es is that of a Brownian motion with covariance
matrix Σ started from 0 and conditioned to stay in the upper half plane for τs −(cid:101)τs
units of time and exit the upper half plane for the ﬁrst time at time τs −(cid:101)τs. If Es does
not occur, the same holds with L in place of R and the right half plane in place of the
upper half plane.
Hence if we condition on σ(A, Es : s ≥ 0), then the conditional law of the collection
of excursions {(Z − Z(cid:101)τs)|[(cid:101)τs,τs] : s ≥ 0} is that of a collection of independent random

from 0 and conditioned to stay in the upper (resp. right) half plane for τs −(cid:101)τs units of
time and exit the upper (resp. right) half plane for the ﬁrst time at time τs −(cid:101)τs if Es

(resp. Ec
By Lemmas 3.14 and 3.15, the set A is a regenerative set, so it is the range of
a subordinator. We will now argue that this subordinator is in fact a 1/2-stable
γ log C and let η(cid:48)
subordinator using a scaling argument. For C > 0, let hC = h + 1
be equal to η(cid:48), parameterized by γ-quantum mass with respect to hC. By the scale
invariance property of quantum cones [DMS14, Proposition 4.11] and independence of
h and ηθ, the triple (hC, η(cid:48)
C, ηθ) agrees in law with (h, η(cid:48), ηθ). In particular, CA d= A
for each C > 0, which implies by [Ber99, Lemma 1.11 and Theorem 3.2] that A has the
law of the range of a β-stable subordinator for some β ∈ (0, 1).
To identify β, we observe that if we condition on Z|[0,s] for some s > 0, then the
conditional law of τs − s is the same as the law of the ﬁrst time a Brownian motion
started from |Xs| reaches 0. Hence for r > 0,

C

P(cid:2)τs − s > r(cid:12)(cid:12) Z|[0,s](cid:3) (cid:16) |Xs|1/2(r ∨ |Xs|)−1/2.

We have |Xs| ≤ supt∈[0,s] |Zt|, and with positive probability we have |Xs| ≥ s1/2. Hence
we can average over all possible values of |Xs| to get that for r > s1/2,

P [τs − s > r] (cid:16) s1/2r

−1/2.

Therefore β = 1/2.
Since we know the conditional law of |X| given A is the same as the conditional law
of a reﬂected Brownian motion given its zero set (which is the range of a 1/2-stable
subordinator) we ﬁnd that |X| is a reﬂected Brownian motion. It remains only to prove
that there is a p ∈ (0, 1) (depending only on κ(cid:48) and θ) such that if we condition on A,
then each of the excursions of Z away from A lies in the upper (resp. right) half plane
with probability p (resp. 1 − p).
To this end, for  > 0 let τ 

0,∞,(cid:98)ηθ

Tu,∞,(cid:98)ηθ

conditional law of the triple (STu,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
of (S0,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)
a.s. The random variable X is measurable with respect to the pair (STu,∞,(cid:98)η(cid:48)

Proof of Proposition 3.3. The proof is similar to the proof that the quantum lengths of
an SLEκ curve on an independent (γ − 2/γ)-quantum wedge viewed from the left and
right sides agree a.s., see [She16a, Theorem 1.8]. For u ≥ 0 let Tu := inf{t ≥ 0 : (cid:96)t = u}.
Also let F (u) := νh(ηθ
Tu as in Lemma 3.10 with s = Tu. We must show that
there is a constant c > 0 as in the statement of the lemma such that a.s. F (u) = cu for
each u ≥ 0.
Note that each Tu is a stopping time for Z and {Tu : u ≥ 0} = {τs : s ≥ 0} = A.
By Lemma 3.15, we ﬁnd that (in the notation of that lemma) for each u ≥ 0, the
Tu,∞) given Z|(−∞,Tu] is the same as the law
0,∞). Therefore F (u) has stationary increments. By the Birkhoﬀ ergodic
theorem, there is a random variable X (possibly inﬁnite) such that limu→∞ F (u)/u = X
Tu,∞) for
each u > 0. By Lemma 3.13, X is measurable with respect to (Z − ZTu)|[Tu,∞) for each
u ≥ 0. Since Tu → ∞ a.s., X is a.s. equal to some deterministic constant c ≥ 0.
We will now argue that in fact a.s. F (u) = cu for each u > 0. For C > 0, let hC and
η(cid:48)
C be as in the proof of Proposition 3.2, so that (hC, η(cid:48)
C) d= (h, η(cid:48)). The γ-quantum
area measure and γ-quantum length measure induced by hC satisfy µhC = Cµh and
νhC = C 1/2νh. Hence if we let Z C and X C be deﬁned in the same manner as Z and X but
with hC in place of h and η(cid:48)
t = C 1/2XC−1t.
Let (cid:96)C be the local time of X C at 0 and for u ≥ 0 let T C
t = u}. Then
we have (cid:96)C
u = CTC−1/2u and
−1/2u).

t = C 1/2ZC−1t and X C
u := inf{t ≥ 0 : (cid:96)C

C in place of η(cid:48), then Z C

(cid:48)([0, TC−1/2u])) = C 1/2F (C

t = C 1/2(cid:96)C−1t and hence T C
νhC (ηθ ∩ η

(cid:48)
C([0, T C

u ])) = C 1/2νh(ηθ ∩ η

Tu), with ηθ

Therefore C 1/2F (C−1/2u) d= F (u) for each C > 0, so F (u)/u
d= F (u(cid:48))/u(cid:48) for each
u, u(cid:48) > 0. Since limu→∞ F (u)/u = c a.s., it must be the case that F (u) = cu a.s. for
each u > 0. In particular, c > 0. Since F (u) is non-decreasing, we infer that a.s.
F (u) = cu for every u ≥ 0.

3.4 Proof of Proposition 3.4

For the proof of Proposition 3.4, we will need two lemmas which will also be used in
Section 4. Our ﬁrst lemma shows that the process W of (3.4) encodes at most as much
information as the correlated Brownian motion Z but more information than the process
X of (3.3) (we will eventually show that in fact W encodes the same information as Z).
Lemma 3.16. For each t ≥ 0, W|[0,t] is a.s. determined by Z|[0,t] and W|[0,t] a.s.
determines X|[0,t]. Furthermore, W|[t,∞) is conditionally independent from Z|[0,t] given
W|[0,t].

Proof. It follows from Lemma 3.14 that each(cid:101)τs for s ≤ t is a.s. determined by Z|[0,t],

whence W|[0,t] is a.s. determined by Z|[0,t]. By Proposition 3.2, if s ∈ [0, t] such that

35

s(cid:48) or W R

s(cid:48) of Ws(cid:48) is 0, then W L

s(cid:48) < s for which one of the two coordinates W L
σs = 0 if and
a jump discontinuity and τs is the inﬁmum of the times s(cid:48) > s at which W has a jump

the event Es of Proposition 3.2 occurs, then Ls a.s. hits 0 inﬁnitely often in [(cid:101)τs,(cid:101)τs + ]
for every  > 0; but Rs is a.s. positive on [(cid:101)τs, τs]. Therefore, if we let σs be the largest
only if Es occurs. Furthermore,(cid:101)τs is the supremum of the times s(cid:48) < s at which W has
discontinuity. Therefore W|[0,t] determines Es, (cid:101)τs, τs ∧ t, and Zs − Z(cid:101)τs for s ∈ [0, t].

Hence W|[0,t] a.s. determines X|[0,t].
By Proposition 3.2, if we condition on Z|[0,t] then the conditional law of W|[t,τt] is that
of a Brownian motion with covariance matrix Σ started from Wt, run until the ﬁrst time
its ﬁrst (resp. second) coordinate reaches 0 if Ec
t (resp. Et) occurs. By the preceding
paragraph, Et is determined by W|[0,t], so this conditional law depends only on W|[0,t].
Furthermore, by Lemma 3.15 the conditional law of W|[τt,∞) given Z|[0,τt] is the same as
the unconditional law of W . Hence the conditional law of W|[t,∞) given Z|[0,t] depends
only on W|[0,t].
The following statement is the key input in the proof of Proposition 3.4.
Lemma 3.17. Suppose given a coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), W ) of another Brownian motion Z(cid:48) d= Z
with (Z, W ) such that a.s. Z(cid:48)
= Ws for each s ≥ 0. Suppose also that there is a
ﬁltration {Ft}t≥0 such that Z and Z(cid:48) are adapted to Ft and for each t2 ≥ t1 ≥ 0, we

have

s − Z(cid:48)(cid:101)τs

(3.6)

H¨older continuous of any exponent < 1/2, so there a.s. exists a random ﬁnite constant

Then Z ≡ Z(cid:48) a.s.
Proof. Our hypothesis (3.6) implies that Z − Z(cid:48) is a continuous Ft-martingale. We
will show that Z − Z(cid:48) a.s. has zero quadratic variation, so is a.s. constant. Fix T > 0
and ζ ∈ (0, 1/4). Since Z and Z(cid:48) are both Brownian motions, Z − Z(cid:48) is a.s. locally
C > 0 such that a.s. |Zt − Z(cid:48)
s| ≤ C|t − s|1/2−ζ for each s, t ∈ [0, T ]. Let A
be as in Proposition 3.2. Our choice of coupling implies that Z − Z(cid:48) is a.s. constant
j := j2−kT and let
on each interval of [0,∞) \ A. For k ∈ N and j ∈ [0, 2k]Z, let tk
T k be the set of j ∈ [1, 2k]Z for which [tk
j ] ∩ A = ∅. By Proposition 3.2, the set
A = {τs,(cid:101)τs : s ≥ 0} a.s. has Minkowski dimension 1/2, so it is a.s. the case that
#T k ≤ 2(1/2+ok(1))k as k → ∞. Therefore, we a.s. have

That is, the quadratic variation of Z − Z(cid:48) is a.s. equal to 0.

36

Proof of Proposition 3.4. By the last assertion of Lemma 3.16, it suﬃces to prove the

statement of the proposition in the case when t = ∞. Let (Z, Z(cid:48), W ) be coupled in
= Zs − Z(cid:101)τs = Ws for each s ≥ 0, (Z(cid:48), W ) d= (Z, W ), and
such a way that a.s. Z(cid:48)
Z and Z(cid:48) are conditionally independent given W . We must show that a.s. Z ≡ Z(cid:48). We

will do this by checking the condition of Lemma 3.17 for the ﬁltration

s − Z(cid:48)(cid:101)τs

Ft := σ(cid:0)(Z

(cid:48)

, Z)|[0,t](cid:1) .

By our choice of coupling, the conditional law of Z(cid:48) given Z|[0,t] and W depends only
on W . By Lemma 3.16, W|[t,∞) is conditionally independent from Z|[0,t] given W|[0,t].
Hence the conditional law of Z(cid:48) given Z|[0,t] is the same as its conditional law given only
− Z(cid:48)
W|[0,t]. In particular, the conditional law of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given Ft is the same as its
conditional law given only (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t]. Since Z(cid:48)
|[0,t] a.s. determines W|[0,t] (Lemma 3.16),
t)|[t,∞) given only Z(cid:48)
− Z(cid:48)
this is the same as the conditional law of (Z(cid:48)
|[0,t], which is the
same as the unconditional law of Z(cid:48). By symmetry, the conditional law of (Z − Zt)|[t,∞)
given Ft is the same as the unconditional law of Z. Since Z and Z(cid:48) have mean 0, we
ﬁnd that the condition of Lemma 3.17 is satisﬁed, so Z ≡ Z(cid:48).

4 Joint convergence of one Peano curve and a single

dual ﬂow line

In the remainder of this paper we will restrict attention to the case when γ =(cid:112)4/3

and κ(cid:48) = 12. Let Z = (L, R) be the peanosphere Brownian motion of Section 1.4.3 with
κ(cid:48) = 12, so that the covariance matrix of Z is given by

−1/2

with α the constant appearing in (1.4) for γ =(cid:112)4/3.
Deﬁne the events Es and the times τs and(cid:101)τs for s ≥ 0 and the random function X as

in Proposition 3.2 with κ(cid:48) = 12 and θ = 0. Since p = 1/2 in this case, the process X
has the law of α1/2 times a standard linear Brownian motion.
Recall the deﬁnition of the two-dimensional random walk Z = (L,R) from Section 1.3.1
and the deﬁnition of Z m = (Lm, Rm) from Section 1.5. Let X be the random walk from
Section 2.1. Extend X to [0,∞) by linear interpolation. For m ∈ N and t ≥ 0, let

(4.2)

In this section, we will prove the following proposition.
Proposition 4.1. In the notation above, we have (Z m, X m) → (Z, X) in law.

37

It is clear from Donsker’s theorem and Section 2.1 that Z m → Z and X m → X in law,
so the non-trivial content of Proposition 4.1 is the convergence of the joint law. To
prove this convergence, we start in Section 4.1 by proving a straightforward invariance
principle for a certain conditioned random walk toward the conditioned Brownian
motions appearing in the statement of Proposition 3.2. In Section 4.2, we use this
invariance principle to prove that the pairs (Z m, X m) converge in law along subsequences
to couplings of the form (Z(cid:48), X) where Z(cid:48) is a Brownian motion with the same law as
Z; and that in any such coupling, the law of the excursions of Z(cid:48) away from the zero
set of X agree in law with the corresponding excursions of Z (see Lemma 4.5 below).
In Section 4.3, we will conclude the proof of Proposition 4.1 by showing that any such
subsequential limit (Z(cid:48), X) must agree in law with (Z, X).

4.1 A scaling limit result for conditioned random walk

Let Z = (L, R) be a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion with covariance matrix
Σ satisfying det Σ > 0, started from 0. Let A : R2 → R2 be a linear transformation
which ﬁxes the horizontal axis and maps the two coordinates of Z to a pair of independent

excursion of time length T (i.e. a Brownian bridge from 0 to 0 in time T conditioned to

Brownian motions with the same variances as L and R. Suppose given T > 0. Let (cid:98)L be
a Brownian bridge from 0 to Ax in time T and let (cid:98)R be a one-dimensional Brownian
stay positive). Let (cid:98)Z = ((cid:98)L,(cid:98)R). A Brownian excursion in the upper half plane in time T
with covariance matrix Σ is the random path ˙Z = A−1(cid:98)Z. Such conditioned Brownian

motions appear in the statement of Proposition 3.2 in the description of the conditional
law given the time set A of the excursions of Z away from A. In this subsection we
will prove a simple scaling limit statement for this conditioned Brownian motion, which
is needed for the proof of Proposition 4.1. Before stating and proving this result, we
record the following fact from elementary probability theory which we will use several
times throughout this section (see, e.g., [GMS15, Lemma 4.10] for a proof).

Lemma 4.2. Let (Am, Bm) be a sequence of pairs of random variables taking values
in a product of separable metric spaces ΩA × ΩB and let (A, B) be another such pair
of random variables. Suppose (Am, Bm) → (A, B) in law. Suppose further that there
is a family of probability measures µb on ΩA, indexed by ΩB, and a family of σ(Am)-
measurable events Em with limm→∞ P[Em] = 1 such that for each bounded continuous
function f : ΩA → R, we have

E [f (Am)| Bm] 1Em → EµB (f )
Then µB is the regular conditional law of A given B.
Lemma 4.3. Let {(Aj, Bj)}j∈N be a sequence of iid pairs of random variables, each
of which takes on only countably many possible values, with ﬁnite covariance matrix
Σ satisfying det Σ (cid:54)= 0. Let
j=1 Aj and

The conditional law of (cid:98)Z m|[0,T ] given Em converges as m → ∞ (with respect to the L∞

metric) to the law of a Brownian excursion in the upper half plane in time T with
covariance matrix Σ.

Proof. By applying a linear transformation, we can assume without loss of generality
that the oﬀ-diagonal elements of Σ are 0. Let ˙Z = ( ˙L, ˙R) be a Brownian excursion
in the upper half plane in time T with covariance matrix Σ. By Donsker’s theorem

(resp. [Soh10, Theorem 1.1]) the conditional law given Em of (cid:98)Lm|[0,T ] (resp. (cid:98)Rm|[0,T ])
˙R). By the theorems of Prokhorov and
converges as m → ∞ to the law of ˙L (resp.
Skorokhod, for any sequence of positive integers tending to ∞, there exists a subsequence
mk → ∞ and a coupling of a sequence ˙Z mk = ( ˙Lmk, ˙Rmk) of random paths with the

4.2 Scaling limit of excursions

s (resp. (Em

In the notation of Section 2.1, for m ∈ N and s ≥ 0, let Em
s be the event that X(cid:98)sm(cid:99) ≥ 1.
s be equal to m−1/2 times one plus the largest i ≤ (cid:98)sm(cid:99)
If Em
s be equal to m−1/2 times the smallest
for which X(cid:98)sm(cid:99) is equal to 0 (resp. 1) and let τ m
i ≥ (cid:98)sm(cid:99) + 1 for which X(cid:98)sm(cid:99) is equal to 0 (resp. 1). Equivalently, [(cid:101)τ m

By Proposition 3.2, the conditional law given G of (Z − Z(cid:101)τsj , X)|[(cid:101)τsj ,τsj ] for j ∈ [1, r]Z

and −1 times the ﬁrst coordinate of this Brownian motion. Furthermore, the paths
(Z − Z(cid:101)τsj , X)|[(cid:101)τsj ,τsj ] for j ∈ [1, r]Z such that the intervals [(cid:101)τsj , τsj ] are distinct are
conditionally independent given G.
It is a.s. the case that Xs1, . . . , Xsr are all non-zero. By Lemma 4.3, (4.3), and
the above characterization of conditional laws given Gm and G, for any coupling of
{(Z mk, X mk)}k∈N with (Z(cid:48), X) as above, it holds that the joint conditional laws of
{(Z mk − Z mk(cid:101)τ

agree. Since Z(cid:48), W , and X are right continuous (hence determined by their values at
countably many times) and this equality of conditional laws holds a.s. for any ﬁxed
s1, . . . , sr > 0, the statement of the lemma follows.

4.3 Proof of Proposition 4.1
Suppose given a subsequence mk → ∞ and a coupling (Z(cid:48), X) of a random path Z(cid:48) in

C with X satisfying the conditions Lemma 4.5. It is immediate from the conditions on

41

Z(cid:48) in Lemma 4.5 that we can ﬁnd a coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), X) for which a.s.

∀s ≥ 0,

s − Z(cid:48)(cid:101)τs

(4.4)
Z and Z(cid:48) are conditionally independent given X and W , and (Z, X) has the law
described in the beginning of this section. Indeed, such a coupling can be produced
by ﬁrst sampling (Z(cid:48), X) and then sampling Z from its conditional law given that
(Ws)s≥0 = (Z(cid:48)
)s≥0 (under which it is a.s. determined by W by Proposition 3.4).
We want to show that in any such coupling we have Z = Z(cid:48) a.s. By our choice of
coupling, we know that the excursions of Z and Z(cid:48) away from the set A of Proposition 3.2
(which are encoded by W ) agree, so this amounts to ruling out the possibility that
these excursions are glued together in two diﬀerent manners to get Z and Z(cid:48). We will
accomplish this using a similar argument to that used in the proof of Proposition 3.4,
but before we can do so we need to prove a few lemmas about the process Z(cid:48) in our
coupling.

Lemma 4.6. Suppose we are given a sequence mk → ∞ and a coupled pair of Brownian
motions (Z(cid:48), X) such that (Z mk, X mk) → (Z(cid:48), X) in law. Then for each t ≥ 0 the
conditional law of (Z(cid:48)

t)|[t,∞) given (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,t] is the same as the law of Z.

− Z(cid:48)

Proof. By Lemma 2.1, the one-dimensional random walk X is adapted to the ﬁltration
generated by the two-dimensional random walk Z. Since Z is a random walk with iid
increments, we ﬁnd that for each t ≥ 0, the walks (Z−Z(cid:98)tm(cid:99))|[(cid:98)tm(cid:99),∞)Z and (Z,X )|[0,(cid:98)tm(cid:99)]Z
are independent. By passing to the scaling limit along our subsequence mk, we ﬁnd
t)|[t,∞) and (Z(cid:48), X(cid:48))|[0,t] are independent. Since Z(cid:48) d= Z, the
that for each t ≥ 0, (Z(cid:48)

statement of the lemma follows from the Markov property of Brownian motion.

− Z(cid:48)

We also have some further Markov properties of the coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), X) described at
the beginning of this subsection, this time concerning the interaction of Z(cid:48) with the
excursion process W .

− Z(cid:48)

the beginning of this subsection. Then we have the following Markov properties for

Lemma 4.7. Suppose given a subsequence mk → ∞ and a coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), X) as in
each t ≥ 0. The conditional law of W|[t,τt] given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t] is that of a Brownian
motion with covariance matrix as in (4.1) started from Wt, run until the ﬁrst time its
ﬁrst (resp. second) coordinate hits 0 if Ec
t (resp. Et) occurs; and the conditional law of
(Z(cid:48)
τt, W )|[τt,∞) given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,τt] is the same as the unconditional law of (Z(cid:48), W ).
Proof. By the Skorokhod theorem we can ﬁnd a coupling of {(Z mk, X mk)}k∈N with
(Z, Z(cid:48), X) for which Z mk → Z(cid:48) and X mk → X uniformly a.s. on each compact interval.
Lemma 2.1 implies that for each k ∈ N and t > 0, the conditional law of (Z mk −

By Lemma 4.4, we a.s. have (τ mk

Lemma 4.2 that the conditional law of W|[t,τt] given (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,t] is that of a Brownian
motion with covariance matrix as in (4.1) started from Wt, run until the ﬁrst time its
ﬁrst (resp. second) coordinate hits 0 if Ec
t (resp. Et) occurs; and the conditional law of
τt, X)|[τt,∞) given (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,τt] is the same as the unconditional law of (Z(cid:48), X).
(Z(cid:48)
It is clear from our choice of coupling and the deﬁnition (3.4) of W that (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,t] a.s.
determines (Z, W )|[0,t], (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,τt] a.s. determines (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,τt], and (Z(cid:48)
τt, X)|[τt,∞)
a.s. determines (Z(cid:48)
τt, W )|[τt,∞) in the same manner that (Z(cid:48), X) determines (Z(cid:48), W ).
Furthermore, the argument of Lemma 3.16 shows that (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t] a.s. determines

whether or not the event Et occurs. The statement of the lemma follows.

Lemma 4.8. Suppose given a subsequence mk → ∞ and a coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), X) as in
the beginning of this subsection. For t ≥ 0, let
(cid:48)

Ft := σ(cid:0)(Z
Then for each t ≥ 0, the conditional law of (Z − Zt)|[t,∞) given Ft is the same as the
− Z(cid:48)
law of Z and the conditional law of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given Ft is the same as the law of Z.
In particular, for each t2 ≥ t1 ≥ 0, we have
t2 |Ft1(cid:3) = Zt1 − Z

E(cid:2)Zt2 − Z

, Z)|[0,t](cid:1) .

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.17, but slightly more work is needed
due to the fact that we do not know (Z(cid:48), X) d= (Z, X).
By Proposition 3.4, Z|[0,t] and W|[0,t] a.s. determine each other, so the conditional law
of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given Ft is the same as its conditional law given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t]. By
Lemma 4.6, the conditional law of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,t] is the same as the
unconditional law of Z(cid:48), so since W|[0,t] is determined by (Z(cid:48), X)|[0,t], the conditional
law of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t] is the same as the unconditional law of Z(cid:48). By
combining this with the above, we ﬁnd that the conditional law of (Z(cid:48)
t)|[t,∞) given
Ft is the same as the unconditional law of Z(cid:48), which is the same as the law of Z.
Next we will compute the conditional law of (Z − Zt)|[t,∞) given Ft via a similar
argument. By Lemma 4.7, the conditional law of W|[t,∞) given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t] depends
only on W|[0,t]. By our choice of coupling, the conditional law of Z given Z(cid:48)
|[0,t] and W
depends only on W . Hence the conditional law of Z given (Z(cid:48), W )|[0,t] is the same as

− Z(cid:48)

− Z(cid:48)

− Z(cid:48)

− Z(cid:48)

43

its conditional law given only W|[0,t]. By Lemma 3.16, Z|[0,t] a.s. determines W|[0,t], so
the conditional law of (Z − Zt)|[t,∞) given Ft is the same as its conditional law given
only Z|[0,t], which by the Markov property is the same as the law of Z.
Proof of Proposition 4.1. Lemma 4.5 and the discussion immediately thereafter implies
that for each sequence of positive integers tending to ∞, we can ﬁnd a subsequence
mk → ∞ and a coupling (Z, Z(cid:48), X) (equivalently, (Z, Z(cid:48), W )) of (Z, X) with another
Brownian motion Z(cid:48) d= Z such that Zs − Z(cid:101)τs = Ws for each s ≥ 0, Z and Z(cid:48) are
conditionally independent given W , and (Z mk, X mk) → (Z(cid:48), X) in law. By Lemmas 4.8
and 3.17, we a.s. have Z = Z(cid:48), so (Z(cid:48), X) d= (Z, X).

5 Joint convergence of two Peano curves

In this section we will deduce the statement of our main theorem from Proposition 4.1.
Before we can do so however, we need to deal with a certain technical diﬃculty. Recall
the discrete space-ﬁlling path λ(cid:48) which traces all of the edges of the uniform inﬁnite

bipolar-oriented triangulation (G,O, e). Let(cid:101)λ(cid:48) be the space-ﬁlling path associated with
the dual bipolar-oriented map ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e). We need to show that for t ∈ R, it is unlikely
that (cid:101)λ(cid:48) takes more than Om(m) units of time to reach the edge of (cid:101)G which crosses
λ(cid:48)((cid:98)tm(cid:99)). This latter amount of time can be expressed in terms of the area between

two pairs of discrete north-going and south-going ﬂow lines. We will prove tightness of
this area in Section 5.1 using a combinatorial argument before proceeding to the proof
of Theorem 1.6 in Section 5.2.

Let (G,O, e) be a uniform inﬁnite bipolar-oriented triangulation and let ((cid:101)G, (cid:101)O,(cid:101)e) be
its dual. Recall the deﬁnition of the space-ﬁlling exploration path λ(cid:48) on G (which is a
function from Z to the edge set of G) from Section 1.3. For i ∈ Z, let λE
i , and
λS
i be the discrete east-going, west-going, north-going, and south-going, respectively,
ﬂow lines (i.e. inﬁnite tree branches) started from λ(cid:48)(i) (or the edge of (cid:101)G which crosses
λ(cid:48)(i)).
For i1, i2 ∈ Z with i1 < i2, let F N

to the west (resp. east) of a ﬂow line if both end-points (resp. at least one end-point) of
the edge is to the west (resp. east) of the ﬂow line. We deﬁne M S
i1,i2 similarly but with
the roles of i1 and i2 interchanged; “N ” in place of “S”, and λ(cid:48)([i1,∞)Z) in place of
λ(cid:48)((−∞, i2]Z). For i ∈ Z we set M N

Proposition 5.1. For each ﬁxed s1, s2 ∈ R with s1 < s2, the laws of the random
variables {m−1#M N(cid:98)s1m(cid:99),(cid:98)s2m(cid:99)}m∈N and {m−1#M S(cid:98)s1m(cid:99),(cid:98)s2m(cid:99)}m∈N are tight.
The reason why we need Proposition 5.1 is as follows. If(cid:101)λ(cid:48) denotes the space-ﬁlling
exploration path of the dual map (cid:101)G, as deﬁned in Section 1.3.3, normalized so that
(cid:101)λ(cid:48)(0) is the edge which crosses λ(cid:48)(0), then the time between 0 and when(cid:101)λ(cid:48) hits λ(cid:48)(i) is
equal to the number of edges in the region disconnected from ∞ by the ﬂow lines λN
0 ,
i . Proposition 5.1 will allow us to show that(cid:101)λ(cid:48) is unlikely to take more
λS
0 , λN
than Om(m) units of time to hit λ(cid:48)((cid:98)sm(cid:99)).
By forward/reverse symmetry of the law of λ(cid:48) and translation invariance, to prove
Proposition 5.1 it will suﬃce to prove tightness of {m−1#M N
0,(cid:98)sm(cid:99)}m∈N for ﬁxed s > 0.
We will do this by bounding #M N
0,i in terms of the ﬁrst time that a certain random
walk hits 0. To this end, deﬁne N i,E
for i, k ∈ N in the same manner as
the times N E

deﬁnition of X m from (4.2) and the deﬁnition of X from (3.3). Let (cid:96) be the local time
of X at 0, as in Section 3.

[Bor81] uses another deﬁnition of local time than us: Given a process Y with the law
of a constant multiple of a standard Brownian motion, Borodin deﬁnes its local time at
0 10≤Ys< ds, while we use the deﬁnition applied in e.g. [RY99], i.e.
0 10≤Ys< d(cid:104)Y, Y (cid:105)s. With our deﬁnition of local time (cid:96)(cid:48) = a−1(cid:96). It follows

Proof. Deﬁne (cid:98)X m := a−1X m and (cid:98)(cid:96)m := a−1(cid:96)m, where a := (3α/2)1/2. Then (cid:98)X m

the recentered quantum cone and SLE pair (h(· + η(cid:48)(q)), η(cid:48)(· + q) − η(cid:48)(q)) in place
of (h, η(cid:48)). The pair (X q, (cid:96)q) is equal in law to (X, (cid:96)) by recentering invariance of the
SLE-decorated quantum cone [DMS14, Lemma 9.3], and the pair encodes information
about the north-going ﬂow line started from η(cid:48)(q) of the whole-plane GFF used to
generate η(cid:48). We extend the processes X q and (cid:96)q to negative times by letting (X q−t)t≥0

Note that the law of X q,m (resp., lq,m, X q,m, (cid:96)q,m) is independent of the value of q by
invariance in law of the inﬁnite volume bipolar-oriented map under recentering. We
extend the deﬁnitions of X q,m, lq,m, X q, and (cid:96)q to negative times by letting (X q,m−n )n∈N0

Proof. Deﬁne Y m := (Z m, (X q,m)q∈Q, ((cid:96)q,m)q∈Q) to be the random inﬁnite collection of
functions on the left-hand side of (5.2). The laws of Y m for m ∈ N are tight: tightness
of the laws of Z m and X q,m follows from Donsker’s theorem; tightness of the laws of
(cid:96)q,m follows from Proposition 5.3 and invariance under re-rooting of the law of the
inﬁnite volume bipolar-oriented random planar map. Consider a subsequence along
which Y m converges in law. By the Skorokhod representation theorem we may choose
a coupling such that the convergence along this subsequence is almost sure, i.e., we can
ﬁnd random variables such that the following convergence holds almost surely along
this subsequence for the topology of uniform convergence on compact intervals for every
ﬁnite collection of times q ∈ Q:

(Z m, (X q,m)q∈Q, ((cid:96)q,m)q∈Q) →(cid:32)Z, ((cid:98)X q)q∈Q,(cid:18)3

Recall from Section 3 that the random variables X q, (cid:96)q for q ∈ Q are a.s. determined
result holds for q = 0 by Propositions 4.1 and 5.3. By Proposition 5.3 it is suﬃcient

by Z. We need to show that (cid:98)X q = X q and (cid:98)(cid:96)q = (cid:96)q a.s. for every q ∈ Q. This
to prove that (cid:98)X q = X q a.s. for each q ∈ Q, since ((cid:98)X q,(cid:98)(cid:96)q) d= (X q, (cid:96)q) so (cid:98)X q = X q
implies that (cid:98)(cid:96)q = (cid:96)q. By invariance in law under recentering of the inﬁnite volume

First we will argue that {tq : q ∈ Q} is a dense subset of R. Observe that {η(cid:48)(q) : q ∈
Q} is a dense subset of C, since for any  > 0 and z ∈ C the pre-image (η(cid:48))−1(B(z))
contains an interval. Next note that if {tq : q ∈ Q} was not dense there would be
an interval I ⊂ R such that η(cid:48)(I) ∩ {η(cid:48)(q) : q ∈ Q} = ∅, which is a contradiction to
our ﬁrst observation, since for each I ⊂ R there is an  > 0 and a z ∈ C such that
B(z) ⊂ η(cid:48)(I). It follows that {tq : q ∈ Q} is a dense subset of R.
Since {tq : q ∈ Q} is dense in R, since (cid:98)Z is continuous, and by left/right symmetry, in

Note that one of Tq\T or T \Tq is empty, depending on whether η(cid:48)(q) lies to the east or

suﬃcient to prove that limm→∞ µ0((T ∆T m)) = 0 and limm→∞ µ0((Tq∆T m

where ∆ denotes symmetric diﬀerence. The proof of these two limits are done similarly,
so we will only prove that limm→∞ µ0((T ∆T m)) = 0 a.s. Almost surely, for each
suﬃciently large m ∈ N it holds that T ∆T m ⊂ [−2sS

of (Lm, Rm, X m) to (L, R, X) on compact intervals implies that µ0((T ∆T m)) → 0, since
