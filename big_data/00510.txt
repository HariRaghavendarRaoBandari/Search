On Pl¨ucker Equations Characterizing Grassmann Cones

Letterio Gatto, Parham Salehyan

Abstract

Polynomial solutions to the KP hierarchy are known to be parametrized by a cone over an
inﬁnite-dimensional Grassmann variety. Using the notion of Schubert derivations on a Grass-
mann algebra, we encode the classical Pl¨ucker equations of Grassmannians of r-dimensional

subspaces in a formula whose limit for r → ∞ coincides with the KP hierarchy phrased in terms

of vertex operators.

The purpose of this article is to advertise the notion of Schubert derivation on an exterior
algebra introduced in [10] by showing that it provides another point of view to look at the
quadratic equations describing the Pl¨ucker embedding of Grassmannians – a very classical and
widely studied subject. In particular, it allows i) to “discover” the vertex operators generating
the fermionic vertex superalgebra (in the sense of [8, Section 5.3]; ii) to compute their bosonic
expressions as in [19, Lecture 5]; iii) to interpret them in terms of Schubert derivations and
iv) to provide an almost eﬀortless deduction of the celebrated Hirota bilinear form of the KP
hierarchy [19]. If B denotes the polynomial ring in inﬁnitely many indeterminates Q[x1, x2, . . .],
recall that an element τ ∈ B is said to be a tau-function for the KP-hierarchy (after Kadomtsev
and Petviashvilii) if

ReszΓ ∗(z)τ ⊗ Γ (z)τ = 0,

It is a fundamental observation, due to Sato [28, 29] and widely developed by his Kyoto school
[5, 6, 17], that (1) encodes the Pl¨ucker equations of the cone of decomposable elements of a
semi-inﬁnite exterior power of an inﬁnite–dimensional vector space. This fact is mentioned
and/or explained in a number of diﬀerent ways, e.g.
in [2, 3, 7, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30] and
surely in many more references. From our part we shall write the equations characterizing
Grassmann cones of decomposable tensors in r-the exterior powers, for all r > 1, in such a way

B0 := (b0, b1, . . .) and let (βj)j>0 be the basis of the restricted dual M∗

To this purpose, let M0 be a free abelian group of inﬁnite countable rank with a basis
0 such that βj(bi) = δij.

LetVr M0 be the r-th exterior power of M0. The Grassmann cone Gr of Vr M0 is the image
0 → Vr M0, given by (m1, . . . , mr) 7→
It is well-known, see e.g. [3, Section 4], that m ∈Vr M0 belongs to Gr if and only if

To state a relevant consequence of Theorem 0.1 above, we need to introduce a few more
pieces of notation. Let Pr := {λ := (λ1, . . . , λr) ∈ Nr | λ1 > · · · > λr} be the set of all partitions
λ(cid:12)(cid:12) λ ∈ Pr) is
of length at most r and [b]r
a Z-basis ofVr M0, i.e. each m ∈Vr M0 can be uniquely written as a ﬁnite linear combination
of the form Pλ∈Pr
λ. Moreover, let Br := Z[e1, . . . , er] be the polynomial ring in the r
indeterminates (e1, . . . , er) and Er(z) := 1 − e1z + · · · + (−1)rerzr ∈ Br[z]. Construct a sequence
Hr := (hj)j∈Z of elements of Br via the equality

λ := bλr ∧ b1+λr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ br−1+λ1 . ThenVr B0 := ([b]r

h0 = 1 and, for i > 0, hi is a homogeneous polynomial of degree i in (e1, . . . , er) provided that,
for all 1 6 j 6 r, each ej is given weight j. The Schur determinant associated to the sequence
Hr and to λ ∈ Pr is by deﬁnition

∆λ(Hr) := det(hλj−j+i)16i,j6r ∈ Br.

For example, for r = 2, one recovers the Klein’s quadric cutting out the Grassmannian G(2, 4)
in its Pl¨ucker embedding (Section 6). Other examples are discussed in the forthcoming [15]
(see also [12]). They all indicate that even for detecting the Grassmann cone G2, computations
are quite painful, surely not as easy as checking the simpler condition m ∧ m = 0. What makes
Theorem 0.2 interesting, however, is that, on one hand, the maps Γr(z) : Br → Br+1((z)) and
Γ ∗
r (z) : Br → Br−1((z)), deﬁned by

Γr(z)∆λ(Hr) :=

and occurring in formula (5), are precisely truncated versions of the vertex operators displayed
in (2) and, on the other hand, the Schubert derivations σ−(z) and σ−(z) are well deﬁned also

It follows that equation (6) expresses the KP hierarchy (1) over the integers. Notice that it
has been obtained by using the indeterminates ei and hj (that may be interpreted as elemen-
tary and complete symmetric polynomials). The latter reveal often more convenient than the
variables (xi), as remarked also in the couple of important and relatively recent articles [13, 18].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 sets the preliminaries and notation used through-
out the paper. Section 2 recalls a few facts concerning Hasse-Schmidt (HS) derivations on ex-
terior algebras as introduced in [10] and treated in more details in [15]. The section proclaims
the most powerful tool of the theory which we call (as in [10]) integration by parts formula.
Moreover, that the transpose of an HS-derivation is an HS-derivation as well is also proven, a
fact heavily used in Section 4 to prove Theorem 0.1. Schubert derivations are studied in Sec-
tion 3, where a few technical lemmas leading to the approximation Br → Br((z)) of the vertex
operators are discussed. A pivotal aspect of Section 5 is that the Schubert derivations σ−(z)
and its inverse σ−(z) enjoy a stability property enabling to deﬁne them as maps Br → Br[z−1].

Their limit for r → ∞ gives rise to the ring homomorphisms B → B[z−1] which enter in the ex-

pression of the vertex operators. The crucial property that σ−(z), σ−(z) commute with taking
Schur determinants, proven in Section 5, is obtained by exploiting a powerful determinantal
formula due to Laksov and Thorup [22]. Section 6 is entirely devoted to the standard example
of decomposable tensors in a second wedge power faced via Theorem 0.2. Eventually, Section 7

is concerned with the limit of formula (5) for r → ∞, where we (re)show that tau-functions for

the KP-hierarchy corresponds to decomposable tensors in an inﬁnite exterior power.

1 Preliminaries and Notation

This section is to ﬁx notation and to list the pre-requisites we shall need in the sequel.

1.1 A partition is a monotonic non increasing sequence λ := (λ1 > λ2 > · · · ) of non negative
integers all zero but ﬁnitely many. The length ℓ(λ) of a partition is ♯{i | λi 6= 0}, the number of

its non-zero parts; its weight |λ| := Pi>1 λi. We shall denote by Pr the set of all partitions of

lenght at most r and by Pr,n := {λ := (λ1, . . . , λr) ∈ Pr | λ1 6 n − r} the elements of Pr bounded
by n − r. The set Pr is a monoid with respect to the sum λ + µ = (λi + µi)i>1 whose neutral
element is the null partition (0) with all the parts equal to zero. If λ, µ ∈ Pr, we shall write
µ ⊆ λ if the Young diagram of µ is contained in the Young diagram of λ.

where [b]r

1.2 We shall denote by M0 the free abelian group Z[X] and by B0 := (b0, b1, . . .) its standard

It turns out that βy : (V M0, ∧) → (V M0, ∧) is the unique derivation of degree −1 such that

βym = β(m), for all m ∈ M0.

1.4 Let B0 = Z and for r > 1 denote by Br the polynomial ring Z[e1, . . . , er]. Accordingly, we
let E0(z) = 1 and Er(z) = 1 − e1z + · · · + (−1)rerzr ∈ Br[z] for r > 1. The equality

Hr := (hj)j∈Z of elements of Br. By construction, then, hj = 0 if j < 0, h0 = 1 and for all j > 0,
hj is a polynomial in e1, . . . , er of weighted degree j, after declaring that ei is given degree i.

1.5 Remark. For the terms of the sequence Hr, the more careful notation hr,n should be
preferred, in place of just hn, to keep track of their dependence on r. To make the notation
less heavy we decided however to drop the subscript r, hoping for the context being suﬃcient
to avoid confusions.

2 Hasse-Schmidt Derivations on an Exterior Algebra

2.1 Given any module M over a commutative ring A with unit, there is an obvious A-module
isomorphism

EndA(^ M)[[z]] → HomA(M, M[[z]]),

map (8).

where EndA(V M)[[z]] denotes the formal power series with EndA(V M)-coeﬃcients in an in-
determinate z. If D(z) ∈ EndA(V M)[[z]], we denote in the same way its image through the
2.2 Deﬁnition. A Hasse–Schmidt (HS) derivation of V M is an algebra homomorphism
D(z) :V M →V M[[z]], i.e:
Deﬁne a sequence D := (D0, D1, . . .) of endomorhisms ofV M0 through the equality:

∀m1, m2 ∈^ M0.

D(z)(m1 ∧ m2) = D(z)m1 ∧ D(z)m2,

Djm · zj := D(z)m.

Then equation (9) holds if and only if the sequence D obeys the higher order Leibniz rules:

(10)

In particular D0 is an algebra homomorphism and D1 is a (usual) derivation of the ∧-algebra

V M0. If D0 is an automorphism of V M0, then the formal power series D(z) is invertible in
EndA(V M)[[z]]. Denote by D(z) its inverse.

2.4 Proposition. Let f(z) ∈ EndA(M)[[z]]. There exists a unique HS-derivation Df(z) :

Df(z)m = f(z)(m)

for all m ∈ M.

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the existence. For all r > 1, consider the unique A-linear extension

This map is clearly alternating and thus it factorizes through a unique homomorphism Df

bf(z)(m1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ mr) = f(z)m1 ∧ · · · ∧ f(z)mr.

of the map Df(z) : M⊗r →Vr M[[z]] deﬁned by
r(z)(m1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ mr) = f(z)m1 ∧ · · · ∧ f(z)mr. All m ∈V M is
Vr M →Vr M[[z]] such that Df

that Df(z)a = a for all a ∈ A). Deﬁne Df(z)m as Ps
m1, m2 ∈V M
ofV M, i.e. m1 = m11 ∧ · · · ∧ m1r and m2 := m21 ∧ · · · ∧ m2s. Thus

Without loss of generality, we may assume they are homogeneous with respect to the graduation

Df(z)(m1 ∧ m2) = Df(z)(m11 ∧ · · · ∧ m1r ∧ m21 ∧ · · · ∧ m2s)

Df(z)(m1 ∧ m2) = Df(z)m1 ∧ Df(z)m2.

= Df(z)m1 ∧ Df(z)m2.

To prove unicity, let bD(z) be any HS-derivation on V M such that bD(z)m = f(z)m for all
m ∈ M. Then for all homogeneous element m := m1 ∧ · · · ∧ mr ∈Vr M:
bD(z)m = bD(z)(m1 ∧ · · · ∧ mr) = bD(z)m1 ∧ · · · ∧bD(z)mr

= f(z)m1 ∧ · · · ∧ f(z)mr = Df(z)(m1 ∧ · · · ∧ mr) = Df(z)m.

The main tool of the paper is the following observation for which we omit the totally obvious

proof. It is responsible, in our context, of the emergence of the vertex operators.

2.5 Proposition (Integration by Parts). Assume that D(z) ∈ HS(V M) is invertible in

the sense of Proposition 2.3. Then the integration by parts formula holds:

σjbi = 0 if j > 2. They are one the inverse of the other:

We shall call them Schubert derivations, in compliance with the terminology introduced in [10,

generated as a Z-algebra by the special Schubert cycles ci(Qr), the i-th Chern classes of the
universal quotient bundle over Gr(Cn), traditionally denoted by σi. So the reason we are using
the same notation, more than an abuse, is to emphasize that we are working essentially with

the same objects, seeing Vr M0 as a module over the cohomology (as in [4, p. 303]) of the

Grassmannian G(r, C∞).

λ is the coeﬃcient of degree r of the expansion of

λ = σ±(z)(bλr ∧ · · · ∧ br−1+λ1 )

in powers of z. Since σ±(z) is a HS-derivation, we have

σ±(z)(bλr ∧ · · · ∧ br−1+λ1 ) = σ±(z)bλr ∧ · · · ∧ σ±(z)br−1+λ1

= (bλr − bλr±1z±1) ∧ · · · ∧ (br−1+λ1 − br−1+λ1±1z±1)

and is so apparent that the coeﬃcient of z±r is [b]r

λ±(1r ), as desired.

3.4 Lemma. The following equality holds in (Vr M0)[[z−1]]:

σ+(z)m = (−1)rzrσ−(z)σrm.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume m = [b]r

λ. In this case

σ+(z)[b]r

λ = σ+(z)(bλr ∧ b1+λr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ br−1+λ1 )

= σ+(z)bλr ∧ · · · ∧ σ+(z)br−1+λ1

= (bλr − bλr+1z) ∧ · · · ∧ (br−1+λ1 − br+λ1 z)

(deﬁnition of [b]r

λ)

(σ+(z) ∈ HS(V M0))

(deﬁnition of σ−(z)bj)

= (−1)rzr [(bλr+1 − bλr z−1) ∧ · · · ∧ (br+λ1 − br−1+λ1 z−1)]

(highlights (−1)rzr)

= (−1)rzr[σ−(z)bλr+1 ∧ · · · ∧ σ−(z)br+λ1 ]

= (−1)rzrσ−(z)(bλr+1 ∧ · · · ∧ br+λ1 )

= (−1)rzrσ−(z)σr[b]r

λ

(deﬁnition of σ−(z))

(σ−(z) ∈ HS(V M0))

(3.3 applied to σr).

An analogous of Lemma 3.4 holds for σ−(z) as well, up to an additional hypothesis.

3.5 Lemma. Assume that ℓ(λ) = r (i.e. that λr > 0). Then

σ−(z)m = (−1)rz−rσ+(z)σ−rm.

(16)

8

Notice that if ℓ(λ) < r, the right hand side of (16) is zero and then (16) fails to be true in
general.
Proof. Taking m = [b]r

λ we eventually arrive to the equality

σ−(z)[b]r

λ = (bλr − bλr−1z−1) ∧ · · · ∧ (br−1+λ1 − br−2+λ1 z−1),

(17)

by just imitating the ﬁrst few steps of the proof of Lemma 3.4. In turn, the left hand side
of (17) can be written as

(−1)rz−r(bλr−1 − bλrz) ∧ · · · ∧ (br−2+λ1 − br−1+λ1z) = (−1)rz−rσ+(z)bλr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ σ+(z)bλ1+r−2

i.e., using that σ+(z) ∈ HS(V M0):

= (−1)rz−rσ+(z)(bλr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ br−1+λ1 ) = (−1)rz−rσ+(z)σ−r[b]r
λ,

where the last equality holds because of the hypothesis λr > 0.

Recall Deﬁnition 2.7. The next easy lemma identiﬁes the transpose σ+(z)T of σ+(z) relating

it with the schubert derivations onV M∗
3.6 Lemma. Let Pj>0 σT

0.

Proof. In fact, for all k > 0:

j z−j := σ−(z)T ∈ EndA(V M∗

0). Then σT

−jβi = βi+j.

σT

−jβi(bk) = βi(σ−jbk) = βi(bk−j) = δi,k−j = δi+j,k = βi+j(bk)

which proves the claim.

4 Proof of Theorem 0.1

The starting point is the following well–known criterion ([3, Section 4] or, in an inﬁnite dimen-
sional context, [19, Proposition 7.2]).

4.1 Proposition. An element m ∈Vr M0 belongs to Gr if and only if the equality

(bi ∧ m) ⊗ (βiym) = 0

X

i>0

holds inVr−1 M0 ⊗Vr+1 M0.

Proof. See [12, Theorem 4.1.4].

Recall from Section 3.1 and Lemma 3.6 that

X

i>0

bizi = σ+(z)b0

and X

j>0

βjz−j−1 = z−1σ−(z)T β0.

Equation (18) can be rewritten, imitating [3, 19], in the equivalent form

Resz(σ+(z)b0 ∧ m) ⊗ (z−1σ−(z)T β0)ym) = 0,

i.e. m ∈ Gr if and only it satisﬁes equation (19). We have:

4.2 Proposition. The following equality holds in Vr+1 M0:

σ+(z)b0 ∧ m = (−1)rzrσ+(z)σ−(z)(b0 ∧ σrm).

9

(18)

(19)

(20)

Proof. First of all

because of integration by parts (11). Lemma 3.4 applied to σ+(z)m gives, after simpliﬁcation:

σ+(z)b0 ∧ m = σ+(z)(cid:0)b0 ∧ σ+(z)m(cid:1),

(21)

Substituting in the last side of (21) gives (20), as desired.

b0 ∧ σ+(z)m = (−1)rzrσ−(z)(b0 ∧ σrm).

4.3 Proposition. The following equality holds in Vr−1 M0:
Proof. Let γ ∈Vr−1 M∗

0 be arbitrarily chosen. Then

γ(z−1σ−(z)T β0ym) = z−1(σ−(z)T β0 ∧ γ)m

(by deﬁnition (7))

(z−1σ−(z)T β0)ym = (−1)r−1z−rσ+(z)σ−r+1(β0yσ−(z)m).

(22)

= z−1σ−(z)T (β0 ∧ σ−(z)T γ)m

(integration by parts (11))

= z−1(β0 ∧ σ−(z)T γ)σ−(z)m

(deﬁnition of σ−(z)T )

= z−1σ−(z)T γ(β0yσ−(z)m)

(deﬁnition (11) of contraction)

= z−1γ(σ−(z)T (β0yσ−(z)m)

(deﬁnition of σ−(z)T )

whence the equality

z−1σ−(z)T β0ym = z−1σ−(z)(β0yσ−(z)m).

Notice now that β0yσ−(z)m is a linear combination of elements [b]r−1
of length exactly r − 1. Thus we can apply Lemma 3.5 to get

λ

associated to partitions

z−1σ−(z)T β0ym = z−1σ−(z)(β0yσ−(z)m) = (−1)r−1z−rσ−(z)σ−r+1(β0yσ−(z)m).

4.4 Substitution of expressions (22) and (21) into (19) concludes the proof of Theorem 0.1.

5 The Grassmann Cone in a Polynomial Ring

5.1 Notation and convention as in Section 1. LetVr Mr be the Br-module structure onVr M0

given by:

ei[b]r

λ := σi[b]r
λ,

which turns ei ∈ Br into an eigenvalue of σi. Accordingly, we have

and then

σ+(z)[b]r

λ = Er(z)[b]r

Thus hi is the eigenvalue of σi seen as endomorphism of Vr Mr, i.e. σi[b]r
particular, using (13) the homomorphism of abelian groups φr : Br →Vr M0 given by
is an isomorphism, as it maps a Z-basis of Br to a Z-basis ofVr M0.

5.2 Deﬁnition. Let σ−(z), σ−(z) : Br → Br[z−1] be deﬁned as:

(σ−(z)∆λ(Hr))[b]r

0 := σ−(z)(∆λ(Hr)[b]r

0) = σ−(z)[b]r
λ,

and

(σ−(z)∆λ(Hr))[b]r

0 := σ−(z)(∆λ(Hr)[b]r

0) = σ−(z)[b]r
λ.

The σ−(z)-image of hn = ∆(n)(Hr) should in principle depend on the integer r. However this
is not the case.

5.3 Proposition. For all r > 1, the following equalities hold in the ring Br[z−1]:

σ−(z)hn =

Proof. We have:

n

j=0

hn−iz−j

and

σ−(z)hn = hn − hn−1z−1.

0 = σ−(z)(hn[b]r

(deﬁnition of σ−(z)hn)

= σ−(z)([b]r−1

0 ∧ br−1+n))

(writing [b]r

(n) as [b]r−1

0 ∧ br−1+n)

(since σ−(z) ∈ HS(V M0))

(apply (9) and the deﬁnition of σ−(z))

= (Pn

j=0

(cid:0)[b]r−1
0 ∧ br−1+n−jz−j(cid:1)

j=0 hn−jz−j)[b]r
0,

which proves the ﬁrst equality in (24). To prove the second equality of (24), we can argue
either by observing that σ−(z) is the inverse of σ−(z) or again by direct computation:

(σ−(z)hn)[b]r

0 = σ−(z)(hn[b]r

0) = σ−(z)[b]r

0 ∧ σ−(z)br−1+n
0 ∧ (br−1+n − br−1+n−1z−1) = (hn − hn−1z−1)[b]r
0.

n = σ−(z)[b]r−1

= [b]r−1

5.4 Proposition. We have:

b0 ∧ σr[b]r

λ = [b]r+1

λ = ∆λ(Hr+1)[b]r+1

0

(25)

Proof. Indeed

b0 ∧ σr[b]r

λ = b0 ∧ σr(bλr ∧ b1+λr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ b1+λr )

(deﬁnition of [b]r

λ)

= b0 ∧ b1+λr ∧ b2+λr−1 ∧ · · · ∧ br+λr

(deﬁnition of σr)

= [b]r+1

λ

(deﬁnition of [b]r+1
λ )

In the Br+1-module Vr+1 Mr we have then equaliity (25) (due to φr+1(∆λ(Hr+1) = [b]r+1

by (23)).

λ ,

In other words the expression of σ−(z)hn and σ−(z)hn in the ring Br[z−1] does not depend

on the integer r.

5.5 To ease notation, let us agree to denote simply by Res(f) the coeﬃcient of X−1 of a formal
Laurent series f ∈ Z((X−1)). To prove Theorem 5.7 below, we need a powerful result due to
Laksov and Thorup [22, Theorem 0.1.(2)]. Let us introduce a few new pieces of notation. Let

pr(X) = XrEr(cid:18) 1

X(cid:19) = Xr − e1Xr−1 + · · · + (−1)rer ∈ Br[X]

11

be the generic polynomial of degree r. If f := a0Xλ + a1Xλ−1 + · · · + an ∈ Br[X] is any polynomial
of degree 6 λ, then for all i > 0 an easy computation shows that

Res(f0, f1, . . . , fr−1) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

5.7 Theorem. The operators σ−(z), σ−(z) : Br → Br[z−1] commute with taking Schur deter-
minants, i.e.:

σ−(z)∆λ(Hr) = ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr)

and

σ−(z)∆λ(Hr) = ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr).

(29)

Proof. Let us prove the ﬁrst of equalities (29). We have

(σ−(z)∆λ(Hr))[b]r

0 = σ−(z)[b]r

λ = σ−(z)bλr ∧ · · · ∧ σ−(z)br−1+λ1

where fi(σ1) stands for fi(X) = Xλr−i − Xλr−i−1z−1 evaluated at X = σ1. By Theorem 5.6 and
formula (26):

= f0(σ1)b0 ∧ f1(σ1)b0 ∧ · · · ∧ fr−1(σ1)b0,

f0(σ1)b0 ∧ f1(σ1)b0 ∧ · · · ∧ fr−1(σ1)b0 = Res(cid:18) fr−1(X)

f0(X)

pr(X)(cid:19)

= det(hλj−j+i − hλj−j+i−1z−1)16i,j6r

To prove the second equality of (29) we exploit the fact that σ−(z) and σ−(z) are one inverse
of the other. Then

σ−(z)∆λ(Hr) = σ−(z)∆λ(σ−(z)σ−(z)Hr) = σ−(z)σ−(z)∆λ(σ−(z)Hr) = ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr).

5.8 Lemma. For all λ ∈ Pr the following equality holds inVr−1 M0

λ) = ∆λ(Hr−1)[b]r−1

σ−r+1(β0y[b]r

.

0

(30)

Proof. If ℓ(λ) = r then λr > 0 and so β0y[b]r
instead, one may write

λ = 0. So, both sides of (30) vanish. If ℓ(λ) < r

[b]r

λ = b0 ∧ [b]r−1

λ+(1r−1),

where λ + (1r−1) = (λ1 + 1, . . . , λr−1 + 1). Thus

σ−r+1(β0y(b0 ∧ [b]r−1

λ+(1r−1))) = σ−r+1([b]r−1

λ+(1r−1)) = [b]r−1

λ = ∆λ(Hr−1)[b]r−1

as claimed.

5.9 Proposition. The equality below holds inVr−1 M0:

σ−r+1(β0yσ−(z)[b]r

λ) = ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr−1)[b]r−1

0

Proof. If one deﬁnes ∆(n)(σ−(z)H0) to be z−n, the equality holds for r = 1. To check the
formula in the remaining cases let us preliminary observe that ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr) is a linear combi-
nation Pµ⊆λ aµ(z−1)∆µ(Hr), whose coeﬃcients aµ(z−1) ∈ Z[z−1] do not depend on the chosen

r > 1. Thus

λ) = σ−r+1(cid:0)β0y(σ−(z)(∆λ(Hr)[b]r

σ−(z)∆λ(Hr+1),

Γ ∗
r (z)∆λ(Hr) := Er−1(z)∆λ(σ−(z)Hr−1).

Expression (31) can be also written in the form

Γr(z)∆λ(Hr) =

1

Er+1(z)

∆λ(σ−(z)Hr+1),

by virtue of Theorem 5.7, according which σ−(z)∆λ(Hr+1) = ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr+1) for all λ ∈ Pr+1.
Similarly, the equality ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr−1) = σ−(z)∆λ(Hr−1) surely holds for all λ ∈ Pr−1. However,
if ℓ(λ) = r, in general ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr−1) 6= σ−(z)∆λ(Hr−1), because ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr−1) 6= 0 in spite

To show how formula (34) works, in this section we proceed to determine all the polynomials

p(H2) = a0 + a1h1 + a2h2 + a11∆(11)(H2) + a21∆(21)(H2) + a22∆(22)(H2) ∈ B2.

(35)

such that p(H2)[b]2
ﬁnd the same expression of the Klein quadric hypersurface of P5. To this purpose we need a
few preliminaries to speed up computations, which by the way could be carried out directly.

0 belongs to the Grassmann cone G2 ofV2 M0. Useless to say, we expect to
i=0 Zbi ofVr M0.

6.1 Consider the two sub-modules σnM0 :=Li>0 Z · bn+i and M0,n :=Ln−1

They ﬁts in the exact sequence

0 −→ σnM0 −→ M0

tn−→ M0,n −→ 0,

where tn is the truncation which maps bi to itself if 0 6 i 6 n − 1 and to zero otherwise. Hence

Vr M0,n is the submodule Lλ∈Pr,n

image of the truncation tr
otherwise. Again, we have an exact sequence

n :Vr M0 →Vr M0,n which maps [b]r

n ◦ φr : Br →Vr M0,n, where φr : Br →Vr M0 is

the isomorphism (23). It is a simple exercise to check that hn−r+1+j ∈ Ir,n for all j > 0. Indeed,
a simple argument (see [15, Chapter 5] or [11] for details) shows that Ir,n = (hn+r−1, . . . , hn).
Let

Let Ir,n be the kernel of the composition tr

πn : Br −→ Br,n :=

the sequence (hj + Ir,n)j>0 of Br,n and then ∆λ(Hr,n) = ∆λ(Hr) + Ir,n. Clearly, ∆λ(Hr,n)[b]r

6.4 Going back to our original purpose of ﬁnding all p(H2) ∈ B2 such that p(H2)[b]2

where p(H2) is like in (35). We use the B2-module structure of V2M2 := B2 ⊗V2M0. Since
0 ∈ V2M2,4, the B2-module structure of V2M2, factorizes through that of B2,4, i.e.

p(H2)[b]2
p(H2)[b]2

0 = p(H2,4)[b]2

0. Then we have

0 ∈ G2,

B1,4 :=

and

B3,4 :=

B3

(h2, h3, h4)

∼=

Z[y]
(y4)

,

where x = e1 +(h4) and y = e1 +(h2, h3, h4). In particular, hi +(h4) = xi and h1 +(h2, h3, h4) =
y. Thus

p(σ−(z)H1,4) = a0 + a1σ−(z)h1 + a2σ−(z)h2 + a11∆(11)(σ−(z)H1)

+ a21∆(21)(σ−(z)H1) + ∆(22)(σ−(z)H1) + I1,4

= a0 + a1(x + z−1) + a2(x2 + xz−1 + z−2)

Γ2(z)p(H2,4) = z2(1 + yz)(cid:20)a0 + a1(cid:18)y −

Resz(Γ2(z)p(H2,4)) · (Γ ∗

2 (z)p(H2,4)) = (−a11a2 + a1a21 − a0a22)x3 + (a11a2 − a1a21 + a0a22)x2y

− (a11a2 − a1a21 + a0a22)xy2 + (a11a2 − a1a21 + a0a22)y3

= (a11a2 − a1a21 + a0a22)(y3 − y2x + x2y − x3).

So, the latter expression is identically zero if and only if the following Pl¨ucker equation holds:

a11a2 − a1a21 + a0a22 = 0.

7 The KP Hierarchy

7.1 Proposition. Let r > 1 be ﬁxed. Then for all (i1, . . . , ir) ∈ Nr, the equalities below holds
in Br:

σ−(z)(hi1 · · · hir ) = σ−(z)hi1 · · · σ−(z)hir

and σ−(z)(hi1 · · · hir ) = σ−(z)hi1 · · · σ−(z)hir .

(38)

Proof. Let us begin by checking the ﬁrst of (38). Since (∆λ(Hr) | λ ∈ Pr) is a basis of Br, each

product of the form hi1 · · · hir is a linear combination Pλ∈Pr,n
σ−(z)(hi1 · · · hir ) = σ−(z)( X

aλ∆λ(Hr)) = X

aλσ−(z)∆λ(Hr) = X

aλ∆λ(Hr). Therefore

λ∈Pr,n

λ∈Pr,n

λ∈Pr,n

aλ∆λ(σ−(z)Hr),

where last equality is due to Theorem 5.7. In other words:

σ−(z)(hi1 · · · hir ) = X

λ∈Pr,n

aλ det(σ−(z)hλj−j+i) = σ−(z)hi1 · · · σ−(z)hir .

The proof for σ−(z) is evidently analogous.

be the polynomial ring Z[e1, e2, . . .] in inﬁnitely many indeterminates (e1, e2, . . .).
It is the projective limit of the rings Br in the category of graded Z-algebras, in the following
sense. For all s > r there are obvious projection maps (Bs)w → (Br)w, deﬁned by ∆λ(Hs) 7→

degree n with respect to the weight graduation of B
