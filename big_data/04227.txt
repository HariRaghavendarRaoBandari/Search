ABSTRACT
Corrections to elastic moduli, including the eﬀective shear modulus, of a solid neutron
star crust due to electron screening are calculated. At any given mass density the crust
is modelled as a body-centered cubic Coulomb crystal of fully ionized atomic nuclei
of a single type with a polarizable charge-compensating electron background. Motion
of the nuclei is neglected. The electron polarization is described by a simple Thomas-
Fermi model of exponential electron screening. The results of numerical calculations
are ﬁtted by convenient analytic formulae. They should be used for precise neutron
star oscillation modelling, a rapidly developing branch of stellar seismology.

Key words: dense matter – stars: neutron – white dwarfs – asteroseismology.

INTRODUCTION

(QPO) in soft
Discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations
gamma-repeaters (Israel et al. 2005; Strohmayer & Watts
2005; Watts & Strohmayer 2006) has stimulated interest in
studying properties of neutron stars and matter at extreme
physical conditions by methods of asteroseismology. The
QPO are hypothesized to be related to neutron star vibra-
tions, particularly to torsional vibrations of a solid neutron
star crust (Duncan 1998; Piro 2005). The crustal oscillation
frequencies are determined by elastic moduli of the neutron
star crust. The main purpose of the present paper is to pro-
vide new results for these quantities under more realistic
assumptions about the state of the crustal matter than in
previous studies.

The bulk of the outer neutron star crust is made of
fully ionized ions in crystalline state, immersed in a nearly
uniform strongly degenerate electron gas. More speciﬁcally,
we suppose that at any given mass density all ions have
the same charge Ze and mass M and form a crystal, if
the local temperature T falls below the melting temperature
Tm = Z2e2/(aΓm), where Γm ≈ 175, and a = (4πn/3)−1/3 is
the ion sphere radius (n is the ion number density, kB = 1).
Typically, one assumes that the ion crystal is of the body-
centered cubic (bcc) type, as this structure is preferable ther-
modynamically for a strictly uniform electron background.
In the inner neutron star crust, at densities above the
neutron drip density ρd ≈ 4.3 × 1011 g cm−3, in addition
to the crystal of ions and electrons, there are neutrons not
bound in the atomic nuclei. The details of the neutron in-
teraction with nuclei are not known very well. The motion

of nuclei about the crystal lattice nodes may be aﬀected by
the presence of neutrons (Chamel 2012). However, for the
purpose of this paper it is irrelevant as we will be concen-
trating on the static lattice case. At the bottom of the inner
crust at densities ρ & 1014 g cm−3 there may be a region
of nonspherical nuclei, known as “nuclear pasta”, in which
the Coulomb crystal model fails (e.g., Pethick & Potekhin
1998).

The state of the electron subsystem depends on the
matter density. We shall limit ourselves to such not too
low densities, where electrons are degenerate and ions are
completely pressure ionized (ρ & 10AZ g cm−3, where A is
the number of nucleons per nucleus, which is equal to the
nucleus mass number in the outer crust; see for discussion
Pethick & Ravenhall 1995; Haensel, Potekhin & Yakovlev
2007). The degenerate electrons are very energetic (at ρ ≫
106 g cm−3 they become ultrarelativistic) and it is typi-
cally considered a good approximation to treat them as a
constant and uniform charge background. In this case, the
ion-electron system is called a one-component plasma (or a
Coulomb crystal, if crystallization is assumed).

However, in reality, electrons respond to the ion charge
density, which results in a screening eﬀect. The strength of
this electron polarization can be characterized by the screen-
ing parameter κa, where κ is the Thomas-Fermi wavenum-
ber:

κa = 2kFapα/(πβ) ≈ 0.19Z1/3β−1/2 .

(1)

In this case β = vF/c, vF and kF are the electron Fermi ve-
locity and wavevector, respectively, α is the ﬁne-structure
constant, and c is the speed of light. Furthermore, β =

(2)

where m is the electron mass and ρ6 is the mass density in
units of 106 g cm−3. The electron polarization is not very
weak even in the inner neutron star crust, where electrons
are ultrarelativistic. For instance, for Z = 40, κa ≈ 0.65.
In the outer neutron star crust, the screening parameter de-
creases with decrease of Z but increases with decrease of the
mass density (i.e. decrease of the electron relativity degree).
At suﬃciently low density, the screening parameter exceeds
1, screening becomes strong and full ionization assumption
is eventually violated.

The main purpose of this paper is to study the elas-
tic moduli of the Coulomb crystal taking into account the
electron polarization. The groundwork for this problem was
laid down by Fuchs (1936), who calculated the elastic moduli
of the static bcc Coulomb lattice. Ogata & Ichimaru (1990)
calculated the elastic moduli of the bcc Coulomb crystal
taking into account the motion of ions about their lattice
nodes. They have also introduced in astrophysics the con-
cept of shear wave directional averaging and an eﬀective
shear modulus of polycrystalline neutron star crust, which
is used extensively nowdays. In that work the moduli were
found numerically with the aid of Monte Carlo simulations
(e.g., Brush et al. 1966). By the nature of the method, the
motion of ions was treated classically.

Horowitz & Hughto (2008) calculated the eﬀective
shear modulus of the Coulomb crystal taking into account
electron screening in the Thomas-Fermi model. These au-
thors restricted themselves to a speciﬁc nucleus charge num-
ber and mass density and have not reported on the depen-
dence of the screening correction on these parameters. The
calculation was done numerically using the molecular dy-
namics method. Again, the motion of ions was strictly clas-
sic.

The eﬀective shear modulus and the Huang elastic shear
coeﬃcient S1212 of the one-component plasma crystal with
account of the ion motion was calculated semi-analytically
by Baiko (2011). In that paper thermodynamic perturbation
theory was employed and the ion motion was included in the
harmonic lattice model framework. Unlike numerical meth-
ods of Ogata & Ichimaru (1990) and Horowitz & Hughto
(2008) this approach allowed one to capture quantum ef-
fects. The quantum eﬀects were found to be rather moder-
ate and of greater importance for lighter elements at higher
densities.

The electron polarization correction to the static
Coulomb crystal eﬀective shear modulus was calculated by
Baiko (2012). In this paper, screening was described in the
linear response formalism. Two models of the relativistic
electron gas response were considered, the Thomas-Fermi
model and the zero temperature random phase approxima-
tion with speciﬁc formulae for the dielectric function derived
by Jancovici (1962). The results were on average compati-
ble with each other, but the calculations with the Jancovici
screening model revealed sharp singularities in the depen-
dence of the eﬀective shear modulus on the charge number Z
treated as a continuous variable. The singularities were more
pronounced at lower densities. Consequently, at certain in-
teger Z and low densities these results deviated signiﬁcantly

from the Thomas-Fermi theory. At the same time, neither
corrections to the individual elastic coeﬃcients nor details of
the calculations were reported. Based on the numerical re-
sults of Baiko (2012), Kobyakov & Pethick (2013) produced
a ﬁt for the eﬀective shear modulus screening correction in
the Thomas-Fermi model.

In their subsequent work, Kobyakov & Pethick (2015)
have re-evaluated the concept of the eﬀective shear modulus
as it is used in astrophysics. Instead of the shear wave direc-
tional averaging, they have proposed to use a self-consistent
theory (e.g., deWit 2008), developed to describe elastic prop-
erties of polycrystalline matter with randomly oriented per-
fect crystallites. In this theory, the eﬀective shear modulus is
given by a nonlinear expression containing all the individual
elastic moduli of the perfect lattice.

The goal of the present work is to extend the work of
Baiko (2012) as well as to provide necessary details of these
calculations. In particular, we report on the screening con-
tributions to all second order elastic coeﬃcients of the static
crystal with the bcc lattice. We treat electron polarization
perturbatively (perturbative calculations based on the one-
component plasma model fail at κa & 1). We propose simple
analytic formulae for screening corrections to all the elas-
tic moduli in the Thomas-Fermi model. We do not analyze
modiﬁcation due to screening of the ion motion contribution
obtained by Baiko (2011) as this eﬀect would produce too
small a correction to the total elastic moduli.

Besides neutron star crusts, the Coulomb crystals with
polarizable electron background are expected to form in
solid cores of white dwarfs, to which the present results also
apply.

2 GENERAL FORMALISM

Huang elastic moduli Sαβγλ are the second order expansion
coeﬃcients of the Helmholtz free energy per unit mass in
powers of the displacement gradients, multiplied by the mass
density in the initial, non-deformed conﬁguration (e.g., Eq.
(5.1) of Wallace 1967)1. They are also known as the equation
of motion coeﬃcients, as they enter the equation of motion of
a material, deformed with respect to an initial conﬁguration,
characterized by an arbitrary uniform stress.

If a material is under an isotropic initial stress, such
as hydrostatic pressure, it is more convenient to use Birch
elastic moduli or the stress-strain coeﬃcients Bαβγλ (in the
nomenclature of Wallace 1967). The convenience stems from
the fact that under the isotropic initial stress these coef-
ﬁcients possess the complete Voigt symmetry and, at the
same time, can be used in the equation of motion in place
of the Huang coeﬃcients. The Birch coeﬃcients had been
generalized to the case of a material of an arbitrary sym-
metry under an arbitrary initial stress in Barron & Klein
(1965), where they were denoted as ˚cαβγλ. They had been
reintroduced again in Marcus et al. (2002) as second order
expansion coeﬃcients of the Gibbs free energy in powers of
the strain parameters. Due to their Voigt symmetry, Voigt

namic potential per one ion and multiplying the second derivative

notation (with only two indices, e.g., Wallace 1967) is usu-
ally used for them. For instance, for the cubic symmetry,
the only independent coeﬃcients are B1111 = ˚c1111 = c11,
B1122 = ˚c1122 = c12, B1212 = ˚c1212 = c44. (Let us note, that
under an anisotropic initial stress the Birch coeﬃcients lose
the Voigt symmetry, are no longer equivalent to the equa-
tion of motion coeﬃcients and cannot be obtained from the
Gibbs free energy, as the latter does not exist.)

The relationships between the Huang and Birch coeﬃ-
cients are well-known (e.g., Eqs. (2.24) and (2.36) of Wallace
1967, for an arbitrary initial stress or Eqs. (2.55) and (2.56)
for isotropic pressure). In particular, for the case of initial
isotropic pressure P and for a material possessing the cubic
symmetry c11 = S1111, c12 = S1122 + P , c44 = S1212. (Addi-
tionally, S1221 = S1212 + P .) These formulae apply for any
partial contribution to these coeﬃcients (i.e., due to static
lattice, electron screening, phonons etc).

The Huang elastic moduli of static (st) bcc Coulomb

Polarizability of the electron background results in a
contribution Fǫ to the system Helmholtz free energy per ion.
We describe this eﬀect in the linear response formalism as-
suming that the electrons adjust instantaneously to the ion
conﬁguration. Thus, the electron response can be described
by a static (ω = 0) longitudinal dielectric function ǫ(q). As-
suming further that all ions are ﬁxed at their lattice nodes
R (and thus neglecting modiﬁcation of the ion motion term
by the polarization) we obtain:

Introducing uniform deformation with constant dis-

and rα → rα + uαβrβ in the exponentials in Eq. (6).
Also we have to take into account a dependence of ǫ(q)

δn ≈ n(−uαα + 0.5uααuββ + 0.5uαβ uβα). [We can also inte-

3 CALCULATIONS WITH THE

THOMAS-FERMI DIELECTRIC FUNCTION

The Thomas-Fermi (TF) dielectric function ǫTF(q) = 1 +
κ2/q2 describes exponential screening of the Coulomb po-
tential with the screening length equal to 1/κ. In principle,
one can use Eqs. (11) and (12) to ﬁnd the screening contribu-
tions to the Huang coeﬃcients. However, (1/ǫTF) − 1 ∼ q−2
at large q and the expression under the three-dimensional re-
ciprocal lattice sum would decay only as q−4. Consequently,
the convergence would be very slow.

Fortunately, the problem can be reformulated using the
“screened” Ewald technique identical to that used in Baiko
(2002). The ﬁnal practical formula for Sscr
αβγλ in the Thomas-
Fermi approximation is given in the Appendix, Eq. (A1). Its
derivation is based on several simple ideas. First, we note
that a contribution to Sscr
αβγλ, corresponding to a given R,
can be written as

Eq. (13) becomes qαqγ ∂2/(∂qβ∂qλ). Summation over R then
yields a series of delta-functions in reciprocal space via the

identity PR exp (iqR) = (2π)3nPG δ(q − G). [The R = 0
term now has to be subtracted as it is already present in the
form of S(1). This results in the S(4) term in Eq. (A1). If A →
∞, S(4) → −S(1) as it should be.] The q-integral is then
taken with the aid of the integration by parts and the delta-
functions. The remaining R A
0 dρ turns out to be elementary
and the result (the S(5) term) contains the rapidly decaying
(for A < ∞) function exp [−(G2 + κ2)/(4A2)]. It is again
suﬃcient to sum over very few ﬁrst shells of reciprocal lattice
vectors G to achieve convergence.

Using Eq. (A1), we have calculated the screening cor-
rections to all Huang elastic coeﬃcients. Since these are per-
turbative calculations, only the lowest order terms in κa are
described correctly. They are ∝ (κa)2 and our main results
can be summarized as

The dependence of some coeﬃcients on β stems from the
dielectric function dependence on n and variation of the lat-
ter for certain types of deformations. These coeﬃcients are
shown in Fig. 1. The Sscr
1122 coeﬃcient is additionally multi-
plied by 3 to improve the ﬁgure readability. The screening

Finally, we have expanded the nonlinear expression of

shear modulus and obtained the screening correction to it
as

(18)

The polarization contributions to the Huang shear coeﬃ-
cient S1212 and the eﬀective shear moduli are, as expected,
negative. This means that screening reduces lattice resis-
tance to a shear strain. Also they do not contain contri-
butions associated with the density dependence of the di-
electric function. Naturally, the polarization corrections Eqs.
(16)—(18) are smaller than the electrostatic elastic moduli
Eqs. (3)—(5) within the limits of validity of the perturba-
tive treatment of screening. The ﬁt (17) has already been
proposed by Kobyakov & Pethick (2013) based on the nu-
merical data of Baiko (2012). However, their coeﬃcient in
Eq. (17) is ∼ 20% greater than ours due to a minor numer-
ical error on their part. Results (16) and (18) are new.
It is also convenient to reformulate our results in terms

From the results reported so far one may gain an impres-
sion that the screening corrections can become very large
relative to the pure Coulomb values of the elastic moduli at
low mass densities and at Z ≫ 1. In this regime our per-
turbative method does not work. For instance, at xr = 0.2
and Z = 26, κa ≈ 1.3. However, in this regime we expect
an onset of partial ionization. In this case, matter can be
approximately described as a Coulomb system with an ef-
fective ion charge Zeﬀ < Z. This eﬀective charge will result
in reduced eﬀective values of κa and S0 to be used in Eqs.
(3)—(5) and (16)—(18).

4 CONCLUSION

We have calculated electron polarization corrections to elas-
tic moduli of Coulomb crystals in neutron star crust. The
eﬀect was described by the Thomas-Fermi model of expo-
nential electron screening.

Combining with Eqs. (45) and (46) of Baiko (2011),
we can now write expressions for the total eﬀective shear

ion plasma temperature. In this case X = A/AN, where AN
is the number of nucleons bound in a nucleus (AN = A in the
outer crust). We would like to emphasize that Eqs. (22) do
not take into account details of “free” neutron interactions
with nuclei in the inner neutron star crust. Here it is assumed
that these eﬀects result in an eﬀective (increased) nucleus
mass and a renormalized plasma frequency.
