Abstract

We demonstrate that rectiﬁcation ratios (RR) of (cid:38)250 ((cid:38)1000) at biases of 0.5 V (1.2 V)

are achievable at the two-molecule limit for donor-acceptor bilayers of pentacene on C60 on Cu

using scanning tunneling spectroscopy and microscopy. Using ﬁrst-principles calculations, we

show that the system behaves as a molecular Schottky diode, with a tunneling transport mech-

anism from semiconducting pentacene to Cu-hybridized metallic C60. Low-bias RR’s vary by

two orders-of-magnitude at the edge of these molecular heterojunctions due to increased Stark

shifts and conﬁnement effects.

Since the ﬁrst proposal for a molecular rectiﬁer 40 years ago, 1 investigations into the trans-

port properties of single-molecule devices have yielded demonstrations of molecular rectiﬁers,

switches and other components. 2–9 However, despite theoretical models predicting that rectiﬁ-

cation ratios (RR) larger than 1000 10,11 are achievable for molecular diodes, experiments have

reported much more modest RR’s. 9 Furthermore, it has been difﬁcult to unravel how nanoscale

structure and local environment impact electrical transport through the molecular junctions

that underlie operation of macroscale devices such as organic photovoltaic cells. 12 Follow-

ing theoretical models, 10,11 efforts towards the synthesis and characterization of more efﬁcient

molecular diodes can be divided into attempts to (1) increase the electron rich/poor characters

of the donor/acceptor moieties, 13 (2) decrease their conjugation, 14,15 and (3) imbalance their

coupling to the electrodes. 7,16–20 The experimental poor performance of these single-molecule

diodes – with the notable exception of environment-induced diodes 21 – suggests that these

physical parameters tend to be mutually exclusive in most molecular systems. 22,23

In this Letter, inspired by thin-ﬁlm organic photovoltaic devices, 24 we simultaneously op-

timize parameters (1-3) by assembling a bilayer heterojunction (HJ) of pentacene (Pn) and C60

- archetypal donor and acceptor molecules (respectively) - that weakly interact through van

der Waals interactions. 25,26 Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy

(STS), we resolve the structure of these HJ’s, map transport properties and demonstrate RR’s

in excess of 1000. We combine statistical current-voltage sampling methods used in single-

molecule transport experiments with local STS to show a strong correlation between sub-nm-

resolved rectiﬁcation and statistically averaged rectiﬁcation. Near the edge of the HJ, however,

we show strong spatial dependence of the conductance channels (through dI/dV ) and transport

properties, demonstrating the importance of unraveling structure-function correlations in these

systems. Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that this arrangement is a molecular

analog to a Schottky diode. Asymmetric coupling to electrodes is achieved through the strong

coupling of C60 with the Cu(111) substrate and the weak coupling of Pn with the STM tip. Our

heterojunctions (HJs) were formed by depositing a submonolayer coverage of Pn molecules
on an annealed monolayer of C60 on Cu(111). On Cu(111), C60 adopts a p(4×4) structure
and hybridization of the molecular orbitals leads to a metallic electronic structure, associated

2

with the strong broadening of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60. 27–29

Annealing allows the C60 to settle into the surface, displacing Cu atoms beneath each molecule

and increasing the hybridization and metallicity to varying degrees. 30,31

Measurements were carried out in a ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) variable-temperature (VT)

STM operating with the sample maintained at 55 K. The Cu(111) crystal was cleaned by sput-

tering with Ar+ ions at 1 keV and simultaneously annealing at 900 K, with a ﬁnal sputtering

cycle at room temperature followed by a brief anneal at 900 K. Pentacene and C60 were de-

posited in the same UHV system using an organic molecular-beam evaporator at 510 K and
710 K, respectively. The C60 ﬁlm was annealed to ≈570 K before Pn deposition. Tungsten
tips were prepared by electrochemical etching; when they occasionally adsorbed molecules

during experiments, they were cleaned by e-beam heating to restore imaging and spectroscopy

quality. Bias voltage VB was applied to the sample. Spectroscopy dI/dV measurements were

performed with a standard lock-in technique. The I(V ) and dI/dV curves were obtained with

a ‘grid’ spectroscopy approach, where the measurements were obtained sequentially in a grid
pattern over a 10 nm×6.3 nm region of the sample. The I(V ) current due to the shunt resistance
(RS ≈ 700 GΩ) of the instrument –measured with the tip far from the surface– was subtracted
from the measured I(V ) curves to obtain the I(V ) behavior of the molecular layers alone; this

was critical for resolving the noise-limited current at our applied voltages.

In Fig. 1(a), we show an STM image of our HJ. Close-packed C60 molecules remained

uncovered in the center of the image as indicated by the threefold symmetry of the molecular

orbitals (Fig. 1(b)), providing the means to investigate the monolayer and the HJ simultane-

ously. The line proﬁles in Fig. 1(e) reveal that the measured step height from the C60/Cu(111)
to the Pn/C60/Cu(111) HJ is ≈ 1.9 nm, indicating that the Pn self-assembles into a π-stacked
structure standing vertically atop the C60 monolayer; the herringbone arrangement of the Pn

layer is overlaid in the image detail in Fig. 1(c). The large-scale approximate periodicity vis-

ible in the HJ is a convolution of the underlying hexagonal topography of the C60 monolayer

and the distorted square unit cell of the Pn thin ﬁlm structure. 32 A simple molecular model of

the self-assembled HJ is shown in Fig. 1(d).

We explored the spatially-dependent I(V ) properties of this HJ by performing STS on a

points as indicated in Fig. 2(a). By ‘simultaneously’ performing the measurements on both the

HJ and the C60 monolayer, we were able to verify that the same tip condition was maintained

for both systems. Tip height at each point was established at the tunneling conditions VB =
−2.5 V and It = 200 pA; no data was ﬁltered from this set. In addition to spatially-dependent
I(V ) data, statistics were accumulated for these structures; I(V ) histograms were separated by

their measured height (as indicated in Fig. 2(a)) and plotted in Fig. 2(b) and (c), corresponding

to the C60 monolayer and the HJ, respectively. Average I(V ) curves are shown with the dotted

Positive (negative) biases correspond to electrons ﬂowing from tip to sample (sample to tip).

1 V, with nonlinear increases in current arising at (cid:39) +1 V and (cid:39) −1.5 V as new conductance
channels appear. Correspondingly, the rectiﬁcation ratio (RR = |I(−V )/I(V )|), computed from
the average I(V ) and shown in Fig. 2(d), is approximately unity up to biases of 2.5 V.

In contrast, the I(V ) characteristics in the Pn/C60/Cu(111) HJ region are strongly non-

ohmic: at positive bias, the current remains consistent with zero and under our sensitivity
limit for biases as high as (cid:39) 1.3 V (shown on a log scale in Fig. 2(c), lower inset), while a
negative bias <−0.25 V results in signiﬁcant current. The corresponding RRs (Fig. 2(d)) are
orders of magnitude larger than in the C60/Cu(111) region with values approaching or (cid:38) 1000
for 0.4 V ≤ VB ≤ 1.3 V, signiﬁcantly larger than rectiﬁcation reported for single-molecule
systems. 14,16–18,20 Interestingly, the preferred path for electrons - from acceptor to donor - is

opposite to the path found in most single-molecule rectiﬁers. 9 As explained below, this is due

to the unique electronic structure of our system.

The computed RRs < 1.3 V shown in Fig. 2(d) are limited by instrument noise on measure-

ments of zero current in the reverse direction, and are therefore a noisy indication of the lower

In order to quantify the RR more comprehensively, we use the stan-
dard deviation of averaged current measurements between −0.1 V ≤ VB ≤ 1.1 V (σ ≈ 23 fA,
see SI) as a proxy for the detection sensitivity to establish conﬁdence intervals for the RR; we
ﬁnd that, with 84% conﬁdence, the RR is (cid:38) 250, (cid:38) 600, and (cid:38) 1000 for VB of 0.5 V, 0.9 V, and
1.2 V, respectively (complete map with various conﬁdence levels is shown in the SI, Fig. S6).

To understand the origins of this strong rectifying behavior, we perform ﬁrst-principles

density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Geometry optimization and electronic structure

calculations are performed using density functional theory with the GGA functional of Perdew

Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) 33 as implemented in the SIESTA package 34 (see the supplementary

information (SI) for details). All structures are approximated by a slab comprising 6 layers of

Cu with C60 and Pn adsorbed on top. For all structures, atomic positions are optimized and

forces on atoms are minimized to 0.04 eV/Å. The bottom 4 layers of Cu are maintained in

their bulk conﬁgurations during geometry optimization. In order to distinguish the electronic

component of the polarizability from the bias-induced structural changes proposed in [ 11,14],

atomic positions are not optimized when an external electric ﬁeld is subsequently applied.

As the PBE functional does not account for van der Waals interactions, we considered two

different Pn-C60 distances; both produce qualitatively similar results. We use 3 Pn/C60 in
the unit cell (Fig. 3(a)) as an approximant of the experimental structure of 3.2±0.2 Pn/C60
measured in STM images (Fig. 1(a), SI). The bias is modeled by an external electric ﬁeld

applied in the out-of-plane direction. The relaxed atomic positions of these structures along

with their changes in Hartree potential at ﬁnite electric ﬁelds are given in the SI.

By considering the difference in Hartree potentials at zero and ﬁnite electric ﬁelds, we ﬁnd

that the bias drops almost exclusively in the vacuum and Pn regions. While strong screening

is expected for a metal such as Cu, the strong polarizability of the C60 layer is an emergent
property of the strong coupling of C60 to Cu(111) and its subsequent partial metallization; 27,30

in contrast, the semiconducting Pn layer can only partially screen the ﬁeld. In this way, the

molecular HJ parallels a metal/semiconductor junction (i.e. a Schottky diode).

This Schottky diode analogy is further validated by examining the density of states pro-

jected on the molecular orbitals (PDOS) of each layer (Fig. 3(b)). The chemical potentials

of the tip and Cu are related to the experimental voltage bias (applied to the sample) as
eVB = µtip − µCu. The Pn, decoupled from the substrate, shows a clear gap in its PDOS (blue,
top) at EF, with a (cid:39) 0.1-eV-broad peak corresponding to the highest occupied molecular or-
bital (HOMO) of Pn located 0.15 eV below EF. In contrast, the C60 layer has signiﬁcant PDOS

(red, middle) at EF, which arises from the strongly broadened LUMO at 0.4 eV above EF.

As we will now show, the large rectiﬁcation is a direct consequence of this unusual elec-

tronic structure. Speciﬁcally, a minimal tunneling model assuming weak coupling between

the molecules and the STM tip in combination with the DFT electronic structure is sufﬁcient

to explain our ﬁndings. Under this mechanism, the electronic transmission is proportional

to the product of the PDOS on Pn and C60, plotted in Fig 3(b). For VB > 0, electrons must

tunnel through the gap of Pn, leading to a transmission probability near zero. For VB < 0,

Pn HOMO inside the bias window, resulting in a sharp increase in current as the Pn HOMO

enters the bias window. In contrast, in the C60/Cu(111) region, electrons must tunnel through

the strongly-broadened LUMO of C60, resulting in no signiﬁcant rectiﬁcation. This simple

model, which neglects the hybridization between the tip and the HJ and is based on the Kohn-

Sham level-alignment, is not expected to provide a quantitative picture; it nevertheless leads

to a remarkable qualitative agreement in the I(V ) as shown in Figure 3(d). It is moreover con-

sistent with the weak rectiﬁcation of C60/Pn/Cu(111) 35 as the strong C60-Cu(111) coupling is

necessary to obtain large rectiﬁcation.

This mechanism is further elucidated by the spatially-resolved maps of I(V ) and dI/dV

obtained in STS and presented in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(c), respectively, where curves taken on a

line parallel to the HJ edge are averaged as indicated in Fig. 4(b). Independently of the distance

to the edge, the C60/Cu region shows ohmic behavior and the Pn/C60/Cu HJ has a large region
of zero current (dark blue region, at the level of instrument noise) for −0.25 V ≤ VB ≤ 1.5 V.
Rectiﬁcation in Pn/C60/Cu HJ arises as a resonance seen in the dI/dV map enters the bias
window at −0.25 V (in agreement with the DFT prediction of Pn HOMO at −0.15 eV).

Moreover, the energy of this Pn HOMO resonance clearly varies as a function of distance to

the edge and considerably impacts the transport properties of the HJ within a few nanometers

of the edge (Fig. 4(c)). Near the HJ edge, the HOMO shifts to more negative VB (or higher neg-

ative energy); we attribute this behavior to a combination of conﬁnement energy of the HOMO

and tip-induced Stark shift due to the reduced screening at the HJ edge. The Stark shift to-

wards lower energy at negative bias is also consistent with Figure 3(b). As the Pn HOMO

shifts towards the C60 HOMO, there is a large peak in differential conductance with a con-

comitant peak in I(V ), followed by a drop in current (negative differential resistance (NDR)) –

a result which is expected if the HOMOs of Pn and C60 are tuned through resonance with one

another. 2,3,36 Note that this spatially-varying response accounts for much of the divergence in

the I(V ) histograms for the HJ observed in Fig. 2(c).

The corresponding spatial maps of the RR are plotted in Fig. 4(d) for the speciﬁed biases

(see SI for comprehensive RR maps). Over the C60 monolayer, the local RR is < 5 over the

entire bias range. In contrast, we observe signiﬁcant variation in the local rectiﬁcation in the
HJ within (cid:39)2 nm of the edge of the HJ as the energy of the Pn HOMO state is shifting. At
low voltages (≈ 0.5 V), the RR increases from approximately unity at the HJ edge to ∼ 100×
larger (cid:39)2 nm inside the HJ. Conversely, at higher voltages ((cid:39) 1.5 V), the RR is largest right at
the edge of the HJ and decreases inside the HJ. This behavior can be traced to the redistribution

of the spectral weight of the Pn HOMO near the edge of the HJ observed in Fig. 4(c). These

spatial maps of the RR imply that rectiﬁcation will occur at higher biases in the limit of a single

Pn molecule on C60/Cu(111).

9

In conclusion, we have observed for the ﬁrst time a non-covalent, self-assembled molecular

HJ consisting of single layers of molecules with an observed RR on the order of 1000 at biases

less than 500 mV. This observation is limited by the current noise ﬂoor of our apparatus rather

than by the diode itself. This arrangement constitutes a molecular Schottky diode, with I(V )

characteristics consistent with a tunneling mechanism. Moreover, we have spatially resolved

the rectiﬁcation ratio and show that it varies by two orders of magnitude on a nm length scale

near the edge of the HJ. The simplicity of the arrangement indicates that these ﬁndings may

have implications for larger scale molecular electronics – such as organic photovoltaics – where

this system could act as an efﬁcient electron-blocking layer.
