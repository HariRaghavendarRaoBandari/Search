Detailed tunneling spectroscopy of vortex core states can provide important insight to the mo-
mentum structure of the superconducting order parameter. We present a theoretical study of vortex
bound states in iron-based superconductors by use of a realistic ﬁve-band model relevant to these
systems, and superconductivity stabilized by spin-ﬂuctuation generated pairing vertices yielding an
s± gap structure. The computed local density of states agrees remarkably well with both the bias
dependence of the local conductance and the spatial structure of the low-bias conductance as ob-
tained by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on LiFeAs [T. Hanaguri et al., Phys. Rev.
B 85 214505 (2012)].

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of the microscopic origin of electron
pairing in strongly correlated electron systems remains
an ultimate goal in the ﬁeld of unconventional supercon-
ductivity. Generating Cooper pairs from purely repulsive
bare Coulomb interactions, as for example in terms of
exchange of antiferromagnetic spin excitations, requires
distinctive properties of the resulting gap symmetry as
given, for example, by a sign-changing superconducting
gap in momentum space. Thus, a detailed experimental
determination of the superconducting gap structure and
its evolution with e.g. temperature and electron ﬁlling is
of crucial importance in order to unveil the constituents
that drive the superconducting instability.

Local perturbations of the superconducting condensate
as found, for example, near defect sites or vortex cores,
constitute an important means to study the gap symme-
try. This is because the low-energy states in the vicinity
of such regions are highly dependent on the properties of
the gap structure of the bulk superconducting phase.1,2
In the case of Fe-based superconductors, scanning tunnel-
ing spectroscopy (STS) studies of bound, or quasi-bound,
states near impurity sites have mapped out a rich series
of tunneling spectra that still awaits quantitative theoret-
ical modelling.3–8 Complicating factors in this endeavor
include the multi-band electronic structure of these mate-
rials and the orbital degrees of freedom of the scattering
centers, resulting in substantial parameter dependence of
the modelling.10–12 The scattering potential from vortex
cores, on the other hand, does not contain orbital com-
plexity/uncertainty, since it is entirely set by the quan-
tum ﬂux lines generated by the external ﬁeld.
In this
respect, it may be more straightforward to deduce prop-
erties of the host superconducting gap symmetry from
the measured tunneling conductance near vortex cores.
In Fe-based superconductors a limited number of ex-
perimental studies have measured the detailed sub-gap
tunneling conductance near vortex cores.4,13–15 For ex-
ample Hanaguri et al.15 detected and mapped out the
voltage and real-space dependence of the sub-gap vortex

core states in LiFeAs.15 This material is particularly suit-
able for surface-sensitive probes due to its atomically ﬂat
nonpolar cleaved surfaces. In addition LiFeAs is super-
conducting in its stoichiometric composition, i.e. without
the complications of dopant disorder, and it exhibits nei-
ther a magnetic nor a structural transition. In the bulk
homogeneous phase, LiFeAs exhibits a typical two-gap
density of states spectrum with the inner (outer) gap
edge at 2.9 meV (6.0 meV)15 composed, presumably, of
mainly dxy (dxz/dyz) orbital character. The latter follows
from a comparison of typical DFT bandstructure results
and the momentum-resolved gap structure as measured
by ARPES.16–18

The main results of the STS study near the vortex
cores of LiFeAs in Ref. 15 include a discrete set of reso-
nant in-gap states with a pronounced conductance peak
around -0.9 meV, i.e. just below the Fermi level EF , and
a smaller and broader conductance peak near -2.3 meV
[see Fig. 3(a) and Ref. 15]. The peaks exhibit symmetry
partners at positive bias, but signiﬁcant anisotropy exists
in their spectral weight. The conductance peak at -0.9
meV disperses away from EF with increasing distance
from the vortex core center and smoothly approaches
the inner superconducting gap. The spatial proﬁle of the
low-energy core states were found to consist of a four-
fold symmetric star shape with high LDOS tails along
the nearest As directions, i.e. the 110 directions of the 1-
Fe unit cell. At biases beyond the lowest energy peak (at
-0.9 meV) the conductance tails split into parallel streaks
and become less pronounced [see Fig. 4 and Ref. 15].

Here we study the electronic properties with particu-
lar focus on the low-energy sub-gap states in vortex cores
in realistic models relevant to Fe-based superconductors.
We include all ﬁve d orbitals of the Fe sites, and sta-
bilize superconductivity from spin-ﬂuctuation exchange
resulting in an s±-wave pairing state. The main ﬁndings
of this approach is a remarkable resemblance of the theo-
retically obtained vortex core spectrum to that measured
by Hanaguri et al.15 Based on this agreement and the
absence of any tuning parameters of the scattering po-
tential, we conclude that the applied bandstructure and

superconducting pairing gap provide a good description
of the superconducting phase of LiFeAs.

Several earlier theoretical vortex state studies of Fe-
based superconductors exist in the literature. Some have
focussed on the eﬀect of competing magnetism and pair-
ing symmetry dependence of the vortex core electronic
structure within simpliﬁed two-orbital models.19–23
Other works have performed a more systematic study of
the vortex core bound state spectrum with the number of
bands.24 In a recent publication, we have utilized a ﬁve-
band model including multi-orbital Hubbard correlations
to investigate vortex-induced stripe magnetism which al-
lowed us to explain recent observed ﬁeld-enhanced mag-
netism in Ba(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2 as seen by neutron scat-
tering and µSR experiments.25 Wang et al.26 studied
the LDOS anisotropy of core states in LiFeAs within a
quasi-classical one-band approach, and concluded that
the four-fold star shape observed by Hanaguri et al.15 is
a Fermi surface anisotropy eﬀect, and not caused by gap
anisotropy. Our calculations presented below within a
ﬁve-band self-consistent approach support this interpre-
tation of the data in LiFeAs. Finally it should be noted
that the experiment by Song et al.4 in which they found
highly anisotropic vortices in FeSe, has stimulated several
theoretical studies of vortices in this material.27–29

Before entering the model and result sections, we note
that a more quantitative understanding of the vortex
cores spectrum in LiFeAs is particularly desirable given
the substantial discussion of potential alternative pairing
structures of this material.30 Speciﬁcally, the less nested
band of this compound31 and the fact that the largest
measured gap appears on the smallest hole pocket around
the Z point, has led to a controversy about the pairing
origin, and the distribution of signs on the various Fermi
pockets.32–38 Thus it is currently of interest to include
other experimental probes to help resolve the detailed
gap structure of LiFeAs in particular, and Fe-based su-
perconductors in general.

voring an s± pairing state. A recent theoretical spin ﬂuc-
tuation study of pairing in LiFeAs used a full 3D ARPES-
derived bandstructure, and also found standard s±-wave
pairing to be the dominant instability.33 In the current
case, the resulting gap structure is shown in Fig. 1(b)
where we plot the amplitude of the gap on the various
Fermi surface sheets. As seen, the largest gap exists on
the smallest inner hole pocket in agreement with exper-
iments. Below, for numerical ﬁnite-size reasons we have
to use a gap that is larger than the experimental case in
order to enhance the spectral resolution at low energies.
This, however, causes only minor quantitative changes in
the obtained LDOS (for example it makes the inner gap
less pronounced).

tum Φ0. The magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁxed such that the ﬂux
going through the MUC is Φ = 2Φ0. The fulﬁlment of the

ducting ﬂux quanta need to penetrate the MUC, the
magnetic ﬁeld is related to the real-space system size
by B ∼ 58500
T (a = 2.66˚A for LiFeAs). For the ﬁve-
band model used here, we are restricted numerically to
systems of sizes less than (Nx, Ny) = (56, 28), which we
use in the present calculation, indicating that we have
a ﬁeld of ∼ 37T , whereas a 0.5T ﬁeld was used in the
experiments of Ref. 15. Despite this substantial quanti-
tative discrepancy, we can still reliably study the prop-
erties of a single vortex since the neighboring vortices
cause only minor quantitative eﬀects. However, in order
to make better contact to the experimental conditions by
Hanaguri et al., we set B = 0.5T in Hz of Eq. (5) in or-
der to avoid unphysically large Zeeman energy splittings.
This is only a quantitative issue and does not inﬂuence
the main points of the theoretical results discussed in the
following sections.

ated by the external ﬁeld can be clearly seen by the two

positive biases which are, however, strongly suppressed
by their associated coherence factors.

To extract information about the orbital content of the
sub-gap peaks, we plot the orbitally resolved calculated
LDOS in Fig. 3(c). Evidently the main inner peak just
below the Fermi level consists of mainly dxy character
whereas the outer peak consists of dxz and dyz orbital
states. We note that as opposed to the case of impurity
bound states, there is no low-energy contribution to the
LDOS from the eg orbitals since the vortex states are low-
energy Andreev-like states whereas the impurity bound
states can be generated from high-energy states.11,12 Fi-
nally, in Fig. 3(d) we show the spatial evolution of the
total LDOS along a line cut through the cortex core. The
main in-gap bound state is seen by the bright spot in the
center of the plot. When moving away from the core
center, the bound state disperses to larger energies and
merges with the inner gap edge similar to the experimen-
tal ﬁnding.15

We turn now to a discussion of the spatial proﬁle of
the conductance at ﬁxed low biases. Figure 4(a) shows
the results of the tunneling conductance measurements
around a single vortex at low biases inside the fully
gapped region.15 As seen, the conductance displays a
four-fold star shape with weight leaking out along the
110 directions. Away from the Fermi level, each of the

four tails split up into two sub tails as seen most clearly
from Fig. 4(b). This tail-splitting appears to set in earlier
(in bias) for positive bias than for negative bias as evi-
dent for example from comparison of the panels at ±0.73
mV or ±1.10 mV in Fig. 4(b).

Figure 5(a-d) shows a representative set of calculated
sub-gap total LDOS patterns around a vortex core. Sim-
ilar to the experimental results in Fig. 4(a,b), the LDOS
exhibit a four-fold star shape with tails along the 110
directions which eventually disappears as the energy be-
comes comparable to the inner gap edge. With increasing
energy, we also ﬁnd LDOS features that resemble that
each tail splits up into two sub tails whereas the more
squarish LDOS pattern found experimentally does not
seem to be reproduced theoretically. The tail-splitting
takes place initially at positive energy as seen by com-
paring the panels at energies ±0.007 eV.

What is the origin of the star-shaped low-energy
LDOS? The spatial proﬁle of core states are known to
unveil nodes in the gap, for example, as seen in the
case of cuprates.2,46 That family of materials, however,
is known to be prone to competing order which com-
plicates the understanding of the core states due to lo-
cally induced spin- and charge density waves.40–48 The
gap structure displayed in Fig. 1(b) exhibits no (acci-

dental) gap nodes but rather a Fermi surface anisotropy
with mimima located mainly along the nearest-neighbor
Fe-Fe 100 directions. This is certainly true for the dxy-
dominated large hole pocket near the M point, which is
also the main orbital character of the inner gap edge in
the homogeneous case, and the lowest most pronounced
peak in the vortex cores. Thus, the gap structure at the
dxy-dominated Fermi surface does not explain the star
shape. In Fig. 5(e-h) we show the spatially resolved dxy-
contribution to the LDOS, revealing that the star shape
is a property of the dxy orbital states [As discussed above,
the dxz and dyz do not contribute much at this energy,
and we have additionally veriﬁed that they do not ex-
hibit ”star quality”]. From the modelling one may also
conclude that the spatially resolved total LDOS exhibits
the four-fold star shape only at the energies at which
dxy dominates the LDOS. In addition to gap anisotropy,
Wang et al.26 recently studied the role of Fermi surface-
anisotropy on the core states. When applied to LiFeAs,
they concluded that the square shape of the large hole
pocket near M = (π, π) with signiﬁcant ﬂat regions along
the 100 directions [see also Fig. 1] feed into the spatial
structure of the core states, and cause a four-fold star
shaped pattern similar to experiment.

We have veriﬁed that the origin of the star-shaped
LDOS obtained in our model is also caused by Fermi sur-
face anisotropy, rather than gap anisotropy. Speciﬁcally,
it is precisely the squarish form of the dxy-dominated hole
pocket as seen from Fig. 1(b) that gives rise to the 110
tails. In Fig. 6(a) we show the Fermi surface obtained by
Ikeda et al.49, displaying largely the same topology and
orbital content as the one used above with the exception
of a roughly circular dxy hole pocket at M . From the
LDOS shown in Fig. 6(b) one sees directly a signiﬁcant
band dependence of the sub-gap vortex bound states, but
in the present case the orbital polarization of the bound
states is even more pronounced. Zooming in on the dxy-
dominated bound state at -0.028 eV, we ﬁnd a perfect

this case the diﬀerent directions of the Fermi velocities
of the M -centered hole pocket are equally weighted and
hence the LDOS star shape has vanished.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In summary we have performed a fully self-consistent
real-space BdG study of vortex core states in ﬁve-orbital
models relevant to Fe-based superconductors. The su-
perconducting order was stabilized by spin ﬂuctuation-
derived pairing vertices generating an s±-wave gap struc-
ture. By application to LiFeAs we ﬁnd striking agree-
ment with STS measurements by Hanaguri et al. on this
compound.15 In particular the details of the energy de-
pendence and the spatial structure seems in almost quan-
titative agreement without any tuning parameters. From
this fact we conclude that our model provides a reason-
able description of LiFeAs, without the necessity to in-
voke more exotic paring states of this material. In future
theoretical studies it would be interesting to compute the
vortex core bound states within other pairing states for
LiFeAs and compare their vortex core spectrum to ex-
periments.
