We present a full study of an improved nonlinear plasmonic slot waveguides (NPSWs) in which
buﬀer linear dielectric layers are added between the Kerr type nonlinear dielectric core and the
two semi-inﬁnite metal regions. Our approach computes the stationary solutions using the ﬁxed
power algorithm, in which for a given structure the wave power is an input parameter and the
outputs are the propagation constant and the corresponding ﬁeld components. For TM polarized
waves, the inclusion of these supplementary layers have two consequences. First, they reduced the
overall losses. Secondly, they modify the types of solutions that propagate in the NPSWs adding
new proﬁles enlarging the possibilities oﬀered by these nonlinear waveguides.
In addition to the
symmetric linear plasmonic proﬁle obtained in the simple plasmonic structure with linear core such
that its eﬀective index is above the linear core refractive index, we obtained a new ﬁeld proﬁle
which is more localized in the core with an eﬀective index below the core linear refractive index.
In the nonlinear case, if the eﬀective index of the symmetric linear mode is above the core linear
refractive index, the mode ﬁeld proﬁles now exhibit a spatial transition from a plasmonic type
proﬁle to a solitonic type one. Our structure also provides longer propagation length due to the
decrease of the losses compared to the simple nonlinear slot waveguide and exhibits, for well-chosen
refractive index or thickness of the buﬀer layer, a spatial transition of its main modes that can be
controlled by the power. We provide a full phase diagram of the TM wave operating regimes of
these improved NPSWs. The stability of the main TM modes is then demonstrated numerically
using the FDTD. We also demonstrate the existence of TE waves for both linear and nonlinear cases
(for some conﬁgurations) in which the maximum intensity is located in the middle of the waveguide.
We indicate the bifurcation of the nonlinear asymmetric TE mode from the symmetric nonlinear
one through the Hopf bifurcation. This kind of bifurcation is similar to the ones already obtained
in TM case for our improved structure, and also for the simple NPSWs. At high power, above
the bifurcation threshold, the fundamental symmetric nonlinear TE mode moves gradually to new
nonlinear mode in which the soliton peak displays two peaks in the core. The losses of the TE
modes decrease with the power for all the cases. This kind of structures could be fabricated and
characterized experimentally due to the realistic parameters chosen to model them.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, plasmonics has been receiving a great
attention from scientists because of its ability to achieve
highly conﬁned electromagnetic ﬁeld and to manipulate
light at nano-scale. Nonlinear plasmonics might be of
interest because the nonlinearity can be controlled by
the power allowing a management of the solution un-
like the linear case. Nonlinear plasmonic slot waveguides
(NPSWs) have been a ﬂourishing research topic, at least
since 2007, [1] due to the strong light conﬁnement in
the nonlinear dielectric core ensured by the surrounding
metal regions and due to its peculiar nonlinear eﬀects [2–
6]. One of the key property of symmetric NPSWs is
the existence of asymmetric modes that emerge at criti-
cal powers through Hopf bifurcations from the ﬁrst sym-
metric mode and also from some higher order symmetric

modes [18, 27]. Several applications have already been
proposed for NPSWs including phase matching in higher
harmonic generation processes [7], nonlinear plasmonic
couplers [8] or switching [9], and also for biological and
chemical sensors [38, 39]. Nevertheless, the experimental
observation of plasmon-soliton waves in these NPSWs is
still lacking even if linear slot waveguides have already
been fabricated [10]. Similarly to the case of the sin-
gle nonlinear dielectric/metal interface structures [11–
15], the modes already studied in the simple NPSWs suf-
fer from high propagation losses that seriously limit the
propagation length of the waves. In the present study,
we propose and study an improved structure in which
buﬀer linear dielectric layers are added between the non-
linear dielectric core and the two semi-inﬁnite metal re-
gions. For the TM case, these supplementary layers have
two main consequences. First, they modify the types
of solutions that propagate in the NPSWs adding new
proﬁles, enlarging the possibilities oﬀered by theses non-
linear waveguides. Second, they reduced overall losses

and allow the losses to decrease with the power in most
of the cases. For the TE case, they reduce the cut-oﬀ
core thickness for the fundamental linear mode, and in-
crease its propagation length. For the nonlinear case,
the losses decrease with the increase of the power for all
the TE modes, and the nonlinear symmetric mode moves
gradually to new nonlinear mode in which the soliton in-
tensity proﬁle displays two peaks in the middle of the
waveguide. We also demonstrate the bifurcation of the
asymmetric nonlinear mode from the symmetric one for
the TE polarized waves.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
scribe the model and numerical method we use to study
the stationary nonlinear waves in the improved NPSW
we propose. In Sec. III, we study the properties of the
stationary transverse magnetic (TM) waves. In this case,
ﬁrst, we describe the linear solutions of the new struc-
tures in order to be able to classify the solutions that
will be obtained in the nonlinear case. Second, we give
the properties of TM nonlinear stationary solutions and
show that, for some linear parameter conﬁgurations, new
modal spatial transitions as a function of power occur
compared to the simple NPSW case. Third, we provide
the full nonlinear phase diagram of the main TM modes
as a function of the total power and the buﬀer layer. In
Sec. IV, we prove that the added buﬀer dielectric layers
are able to reduce propagation losses and allow them to
decrease with power in most of the cases for the TM case.
In Sec. V using the FDTD method we study the stabil-
ity properties of the main nonlinear TM solutions for the
most signiﬁcant cases. Finally, in Sec. VI, we study the
existence and the properties of TE modes for both linear
and nonlinear core.

II. MODEL AND METHOD

The improved NPSW we study is depicted in Fig. 1,
compared to already studied simple NPSW made of a
nonlinear dielectric core surrounded by two semi-inﬁnite
metal regions [1, 2, 6], the improved structure contains
additional linear dielectric layers between the core and
the metal regions. In this study, we will consider only
symmetric structures even if asymmetric simple NPSWs
have already been considered [18]. dcore is the core thick-
ness, and dbuf is the dielectric buﬀer thickness of each
of the supplementary layers with their permittivities de-
noted by εbuf . We will only consider either monochro-
matic transverse magnetic (TM) waves or transverse elec-
tric (TE) waves propagating along the z direction in
a symmetric one-dimensional NPSW. All ﬁeld compo-
nents evolve proportionally to exp[i(k0nef f z − ωt)] with
k0 = ω/c, where c denotes the speed of light in vacuum,
ω is the angular frequency, and nef f denotes the eﬀec-
tive mode index. The nonlinear Kerr-type dielectric is
isotropic with focusing nonlinearity.

For the TM polarized waves, the permittivity in the
nonlinear core is deﬁned as εcore = εl,core+α|Ex|2 (εl,core

being the linear part of the core permittivity, Ex be-
ing the x component of the electric ﬁeld), and with
α > 0 (focusing nonlinearity). This approximation of
the Kerr nonlinearity, taking into account only the trans-
verse component of the electric ﬁeld has already been
used in several models of the NPSWs [6, 18].
It pro-
vides similar results than the more accurate approach
where all the electric ﬁeld components are considered in
the optical Kerr eﬀect [6, 18, 19], even if at high power
its results diﬀer from the ones obtained with the full
model taking into account all the electric ﬁeld compo-
nents in the nonlinear term [18, 27]. This approxima-
tion allows us to use the ﬁxed power algorithm in the
ﬁnite element method (FEM) to compute the nonlin-
ear stationary solutions and their nonlinear dispersion
curves [19–22].
In the core, the approximated relation
between the nonlinear parameter α and the coeﬃcient
n2, that appears in the deﬁnition of an intensity depen-
dent refractive index ℜe(ncore) = ℜe(εl,core)1/2 +n2Icore,
is α = ε0cℜe(εl,core)n2, where the intensity inside the
core is deﬁned as Icore = ε0c|εcore||Ex|2/(2nef f ), and
the vacuum permittivity is denoted by ε0. For the TE
case, the only nonzero component of the electric ﬁeld
is Ey and the permittivity in the core is deﬁned as
εcore = εl,core + α|Ey|2, with α > 0 (focusing nonlin-
earity). In general, the TE surface plasmon waves do not
exit due to continuity of the component Ey. But, the fun-
damental TE mode exists only if the the core thickness
beyond a cut-oﬀ [32, 37].

To compute the linear and nonlinear modes we use our
custom-built FEM we developed to study both scalar and
vector models for several types of waveguides including
nonlinear ones with Kerr regions like microstructured op-
tical ﬁbers and NPSWs [19, 22, 24, 34].
In this study,
εl,core = 3.462 + i 10−4 and n2 = 10−17m2/W, corre-
sponding to amorphous hydrogenated silicon [16, 17], and
εmet = −90 + i 10 corresponding to gold at λ = 1.55
µm [35, 36], wavelength for which all the simulations are
done. The propagation losses will be estimated using the
method based on the ﬁeld proﬁles and imaginary parts
of the permittivities described in [11, 25], that is similar
to the ones from [3, 18]. We stress that the considered
parameter values can aﬀect the critical values given in
this study but would not aﬀect its main conclusions.

III. RESULTS FOR TM STATIONARY WAVES

Equations (1) and (2) give the linear dispersion rela-
tion for TM waves for a linear dielectric buﬀer layer
sandwiched between a semi-inﬁnite metal region and
a semi-inﬁnite high-index dielectric region. By letting
(ℜe(nef f ))2 → ǫl,core in Eqns. (1) and (2), one gets:

One clearly see that, the critical buﬀer thickness given
by Eq. (3), does not depend on the core thickness dcore
which can be inferred from our FEM simulations depicted
in Fig. 2(a). Using the parameters in Sec. II, εbuf = 2.52
and dbuf = 15 nm, the full formula given by Eq. (3) gives
dup
buf = 31.81 nm, this result agrees quite well with our
FEM simulations (30.8 nm) as it is shown for the blue
curves in Fig. 2(a). An approximated value for dup
buf (28.4

III.2. Nonlinear case

For the nonlinear case, we study the inﬂuence of the
supplementary buﬀer dielectric layers on the nonlinear
dispersion curves. We consider the case in which εbuf =
2.52 and dcore = 400 nm, which corresponds to the solid
blue curve in Fig. 2(a) with the associated linear ﬁeld
proﬁles depicted in Fig. 2(b), (c), and (d). We start
with the case such that the eﬀective index of the sym-
metric linear mode is below the core linear refractive in-
dex in which the symmetric linear mode is localized in
the high-index core with plasmonic tails in the metal re-
gions (see Fig. 2(b)). The real part of eﬀective indices of
the ﬁrst three main modes: symmetric, asymmetric and
antisymmetric denoted by; S0-solI, AS1-solI, and AN0-
solI, respectively are shown in Fig. 3(b) with the cor-
responding ﬁeld proﬁles depicted in Fig. 4(d), (e), and
(f). The results for a simple NPSW made from the im-
proved NPSW by removing the buﬀer dielectric layers
are also shown in Fig. 3(a) for comparison (symmetric
S0-plas, asymmetric AS1-plas, antisymmetric AN0-plas)
and the associated ﬁeld proﬁles are given in Fig. 4(a),
(b), and (c). The mode notation used in our study has
been chosen to extend coherently the one already intro-
duced for the simple NPSW [18, 27]. As it can be seen, in
the improved NPSW, the bifurcation of the asymmetric
mode from the symmetric mode and the relative posi-
tions of the three main modes are preserved. The diﬀer-
ence between the nonlinear symmetric mode curve and
the asymmetric nonlinear mode curve is smaller in this
new structure (see Fig. 3(b)). The reason is that, in this
case, the nonlinear symmetric mode proﬁle looks like a
symmetric hyperbolic secant spatial soliton and its as-
sociated asymmetric mode is simply shifted oﬀ the slot
center as it is shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e).

We now study the nonlinear dispersion curves of the
improved NPSW such that the eﬀective index of the sym-
metric linear mode is above the core linear refractive in-
dex. The symmetric linear mode is of plasmonic type
as it is shown in Fig. 2(d). The corresponding nonlinear
dispersion curves are given in Fig. 3(c) and (d) in which
the values of the buﬀer layer thicknesses are dbuf = 15
nm and dbuf = 10 nm, respectively. The global shape of
these dispersion curves is similar to the ones already stud-

ied for the three main modes of the simple NPSW (see
Fig. 3(a)), but the mode ﬁeld proﬁles now exhibit a spa-
tial transition from a plasmonic type proﬁle to a solitonic
type one. For the asymmetric one: the mode moves grad-
ually from AS1-plas to AS1-solI, and the antisymmetric
mode moves from AN0-plas to AN0-solI. The correspond-
ing ﬁeld proﬁles for dbuf = 15 nm are shown in Fig. 5(b)
and (c). For dbuf = 10 nm, the modal transitions for
the asymmetric and the antisymmetric modes are shown
in Fig. 6 (green and red curves, respectively). Never-
theless, depending on the thickness of the buﬀer layers,
the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-plas exhibits spatial
modal transition toward two diﬀerent nonlinear symmet-
ric solitonic modes. In Fig. 3(c): the symmetric S0-plas
mode exhibits spatial transition to symmetric solitonic
mode S0-solI; one single peak located in the nonlinear
core as it is shown in Fig. 5(a). While, in Fig. 3(d) in

which dbuf = 10 nm, the symmetric mode S0-plas turns
gradually to the new nonlinear symmetric mode denoted
by S0-solII (dashed blue line to solid dark blue line in
Fig. 3(d)); it is composed of two solitons located in the
core near each interfaces (see dark blue curves in Fig. 6).
The solid blue curve in Fig. 3(d) above the dark blue
curve, represents the symmetric nonlinear mode S0-solI
which emerges at speciﬁc value of the power as a purely
nonlinear mode. The ﬁeld proﬁle is similar to the solid
blue proﬁles in Figs. 4(d) and 5(a). In general, the sym-
metric solitonic mode S0-solI looks like the higher order
purely nonlinear symmetric mode denoted by SI which
has been found in the simple NPSW, but with diﬀerent
boundary conditions at the core interface due to the op-
posite sign of the real part of the permittivity in the outer
regions [6, 27].

FIG. 6. Field proﬁles Hy(x) for the symmetric (blue curves),
asymmetric (green curves) , and antisymmetric (red curves)
TM modes for dbuf = 10 nm, dcore = 400 nm, and εbuf =
2.52.

III.2.1. Nonlinear phase diagrams

Using numerical simulations providing both the dis-
persion curves and the associated ﬁeld proﬁles like the
ones shown above, we obtain the phase diagram of the
improved NPSW for the main modes. Such diagram is
shown in Fig. 7 where the existence and the type of the
ﬁrst TM symmetric and asymmetric modes are given.
The buﬀer thickness dbuf and the total power Ptot are
used as parameters. The core thickness dcore = 400 nm
and the permittivity of the buﬀer layers εbuf = 2.52, are
ﬁxed which provide the solid blue curve of the linear main
symmetric mode shown in Fig. 2, and the nonlinear dis-
persion curves given in Fig. 3. For these parameters, the
critical value of the buﬀer layers dup
buf in which the fun-
damental linear symmetric mode is ﬂat in the core (see
Fig. 2(c)) is ≈ 30.82 nm. The nonlinear phase diagram
depicted in Fig. 7, provides us with the type and the
existence of the main symmetric and asymmetric modes
that can be found in the improved NPSW as a func-
tion of the buﬀer layer thickness dbuf . This phase dia-
gram is divided into three regions. The ﬁrst region is for
dbuf > dup
buf (right most grey region). In this region, the
symmetric linear mode is localized in the high-index core
with ℜe(nef f ) < ℜe(nl,core) as it is given in Fig. 2(b).
As the power increases, the main symmetric mode tends
to be more localized in the core with plasmonic tails in
the metal regions, it is of S0-solI type (symmetric soliton-
type with a single peak as it is shown in Fig. 4(a)). Due
to the nonlinearity, the asymmetric nonlinear mode bifur-
cates from the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-solI at some
critical power value (see solid green curve in Fig. 7). It is
denoted by AS1-solI (soliton peak shifted-oﬀ the slot cen-
ter as it is depicted in Fig. 4(b)). Above the bifurcation
threshold curve, both the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-
solI and the nonlinear asymmetric mode AS1-solI exist as
it is shown in the nonlinear dispersion diagram obtained
for dbuf = 40 nm in Fig. 3(b).

FIG. 7. Phase diagram of the TM modes of the improved
NPSW as a function of dielectric buﬀer thickness dbuf and
of the total power Ptot for dcore = 400 nm and εbuf = 2.52.
The green curves refer to the ﬁrst asymmetric modes. Ar-
rows indicates the corresponding mode transition across the
associated curve (thin one).

The second region is for ddown

buf (yellow
region). In this region, the symmetric linear mode is of

buf < dbuf < dup

5

plasmonic type (see the ﬁeld proﬁle in Fig. 2(d)). Below
the brown curve labelled ”S0-plas to S0-solI” in Fig. 7,
the nonlinear symmetric mode is of plasmonic type S0-
plas. With the increase of power, the nonlinear symmet-
ric mode S0-plas exhibits a spatial modal transition from
S0-plas to S0-solI (see Fig. 5(a)), in which the mode be-
comes more localized in the nonlinear core (single spatial
soliton peak in the nonlinear core with plasmonic tails in
the metal regions as it is given in Fig. 5(a)). Along the
brown curve, the nonlinear symmetric mode is ﬂat in the
core (the arrow indicates the transition from S0-plas to
S0-solI). Above dbuf ≃ 24 nm (but below dup
buf ), the solid
green curve above the brown thin line in Fig. 7, repre-
sents the limit curve for the nonlinear asymmetric mode
AS1-solI: below the curve, it does not exist. It emerges
directly from the symmetric nonlinear mode S0-solI as
expected (see Fig. 4(e) for an example of such ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle). For ddown
buf < dbuf < 24 nm, the dashed green curve
is the limit curve of the asymmetric plasmonic mode AS0-
plas: below the curve, it does not exist. It emerges at low
powers from the symmetric one, S0-plas (see the dashed
green curve in Fig. 3(c)). At higher powers (see the solid
green line in Fig. 7), it moves to an asymmetric mode
of solitonic type AS1-solI (a peak being located in the
core and near one of its interface, see solid line proﬁle
in Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 3(c) represent an example of the dis-
persion curves, and Fig. 5 shows the corresponding ﬁeld
proﬁles in this second region for dbuf = 15 nm. The
nonlinear dispersion curves in Fig. 3(c) can be seen as
a vertical cut at dbuf = 15 nm in the nonlinear phase
diagram depicted in Fig. 7.

buf

The third region:

for 0 < dbuf < ddown

(left most
white region). The symmetric linear mode is of plas-
monic type as it can be inferred from Fig. 2(a). Below
the cyan curve labelled ”S0-plas to S0-solII”, the nonlin-
ear symmetric mode is of plasmonic type S0-plas. Above
the cyan curve, the new symmetric nonlinear solution S0-
solII emerges, at high powers, from the S0-plas mode; it
is composed of two solitons located in the core near each
interfaces (see the dark blue curves in the ﬁrst row of
Fig. 6). The transition curve between the S0-plas region
and the S0-solII region is shown in cyan in the phase
diagram shown in Fig. 7.
It is worth mentioning that,
the symmetric nonlinear mode S0-solII (see ﬁrst row of
Fig. 6) is diﬀerent from the asymmetric mode shown in
Fig. 5(b). Furthermore, this mode exists for core thick-
nesses as small as 100 nm and it can not be considered in
this case as equivalent to the mirror-imaged of the mode
existing in the single interface conﬁguration [5]. In this
third region, the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-solI (sin-
gle peak in the core) appears as a purely nonlinear mode
without any reference in the linear case. The limit curve
for the emergence of the S0-solI is shown in thick pink
in the phase diagram. It is worth mentioning that, the
appearance of the S0-solI is similar to the appearance of
the nonlinear symmetric higher order mode denoted by
SI for the simple NPSW [6, 27], but with diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions at the core interface due to the opposite

sign of the real part of the permittivity in the outer re-
gions. For dbuf = 0 nm (simple NPSW), we recover
the same type of modes as expected. It is important to
point out that in the region above the cyan curve and
below the pink one, only the S0-solII mode exists. The
asymmetric nonlinear plasmonic mode AS1-plas emerges
at low power from the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-plas
(dashed green curve), and moves gradually to the nonlin-
ear symmetric mode AS1-solI (solid green curve). For an
example of the nonlinear dispersion curves with the cor-
responding ﬁeld proﬁles in this third region, see Fig. 3(d)
and Fig. 6, respectively. This example can be seen as a
vertical cut in Fig. 7 at dbuf = 10 nm.

As we mentioned before, the linear symmetric mode
for dbuf = dup
buf ≈ 30.82 nm is ﬂat in the core (see
Fig. 2(c) for an example of such mode proﬁle). For
the nonlinear case, the mode is still nearly ﬂat in the
core up to some critical value of the power such that
above this value a peak emerges in the core, and the
symmetric mode becomes of S0-solI type. The critical
power is shown as black circle in Fig. 7 which corre-
sponds to Ptot ≈ 109 [W/m]. The asymmetric mode
AS1-solI bifurcates directly from the symmetric mode
S0-solI as expected which is indicated by the crossing
between the solid green curve and the the vertical thin
line at dbuf = dup
buf in Fig. 7. The results for the simple
NPSW correspond to the vertical line at dbuf = 0.0 nm.
At low power, the symmetric mode is of plasmonic type
S0-plas (see Fig.4(a)). The bifurcation of the asymmet-
ric nonlinear mode AS1-plas from the symmetric mode
S0-plas is represented by the beginning of the dashed
green curve at dbuf = 0.0 nm. Above this point, both
the symmetric S0-plas, and the asymmetric mode AS1-
plas exist as it is shown in Fig. 3(a). The beginning of
the pink curve at dbuf = 0.0 nm corresponds to the ap-
pearance of the symmetric higher order mode denoted
by SI [18, 27]. This mode looks like the symmetric mode
S0-solI (see solid blue proﬁle Figs. 4 and 5), but with
diﬀerent boundary conditions at the core interface as we
mentioned before. In Fig. 8, we study the inﬂuence of

The horizontal line represents the upper critical value

upper critical value dup
buf does not change with the core
thickness as expected (see Eq. (3)). While, ddown
in-
creases with dcore, such that they coincide when the core
thickness reaches the critical value dλ
core ≃ 1550 nm (one
wavelength), above this core thickness, the critical value
ddown
buf will no longer change with dcore. We also provide
elsewhere the phase diagram of the improved NPSW us-
ing dcore and Ptot as parameters, for a given ﬁxed values
of dbuf and εbuf [33]. We found that the threshold for
the Hopf bifurcation, from which the asymmetric mode
emerges, strongly decreases with the core thickness as
it was already found in the simple NPSW [18, 27]. We
provided the nonlinear phase diagram describing the ex-
istence and the type of the main TM modes in our im-
proved structure. We have seen the importance of the
inclusion of the supplementary buﬀer layers on the types
of solutions that propagate in the NPSWs. Neverthe-
less, these supplementary layers slightly shift the bifur-
cation threshold toward higher powers as it is depicted
in Fig. 7. While, the increase of the core thickness, re-
duces the bifurcation threshold [33] as expected from the
simple NPSWs. [18, 27].

IV. STUDY OF THE LOSSES FOR TM WAVES

In the previous section III.2, we have shown the in-
ﬂuence of the supplementary buﬀer layers on the type
of modes (for the TM case) that propagate in the sim-
ple NPSW. We demonstrated that, even for a very thin
buﬀer dielectric layers, the type of the nonlinear modes
propagating in the simple NPSW is modiﬁed (see phase
diagram in Fig. 7 and the nonlinear dispersion curves de-
picted in Fig. 3). In this section, we study the inﬂuence of
the buﬀer layers on the overall losses. The imaginary part
of the eﬀective indices of the main modes with the cor-
responding values of the losses are shown in Fig. 9 which
corresponds to Fig. 3 for the real part of the eﬀective in-
dices. The losses are estimated using the approach based
on the imaginary part of the permittivity and the ﬁeld
proﬁles. This method is described in the case of linear
waveguides [25] and has also been used for the nonlinear
studies [15, 19].

For the simple slot conﬁguration, the losses of the three
main modes increase with the power as it is shown in
Fig. 9(a). For dbuf = 40 nm, in which the symmetric lin-
ear mode is core localized and the nonlinear modes are
of solitonic type (see Fig. 4), we found that the losses
are at least three times smaller than the ones of the sim-
ple NPSW, and that they decrease with the power unlike
the simple NPSW (see Fig. 9(b)). We now study the
losses for the improved NPSW in which the eﬀective in-
dex of the symmetric linear mode is above the core linear
refractive index. The corresponding curves are given in
Fig. 9(c) and (d). As we have seen before in Fig. 3(c) and

FIG. 9. Losses for the simple NPSW (grey curves) and for
the improved one (color curves). The blue, green, and red
colors indicate the symmetric, asymmetric and antisymmet-
ric nonlinear TM modes, respectively. dcore = 400 nm and
εbuf = 2.52. (b) for dbuf = 40 nm, (c) for dbuf = 15 nm, and
(d) for dbuf = 10 nm. For the real part of the eﬀective indices
see Fig. 3. For the ﬁeld proﬁles see Figs. 4, 5, and 6.

(d), the mode ﬁeld proﬁles now exhibit a spatial transi-
tion from a plasmonic type proﬁle to a solitonic type one.
Furthermore, at low powers, the losses are reduced, at
least, by a factor two compared to the associated simple
NPSW. For dbuf = 15 nm, the losses decrease with the
power for the main symmetric and antisymmetric modes
leading to low loss solutions at high powers (see blue and
red curves in Fig. 9(c) and the associated ﬁeld proﬁles in
Fig. 5(a) and (c)). For the asymmetric mode, loss ﬁrst in-
creases with power and then decreases. This loss increase
is linked to the fact that, in this case, the ﬁeld ﬁrst tends
to increase near one of the metal interface, increasing the
fraction of ﬁeld in a highly lossy region. Then, the mode
moves gradually from a plasmonic type to a solitonic type
asymmetric proﬁle, and when the peak of the soliton is
far enough from the metal interface the losses start to
decrease as it is shown in Fig. 5(b). For dbuf = 10 nm,
losses of the three main modes ﬁrst, increase with the
power and then decrease. The increase of the losses can
be understood by looking at the ﬁeld proﬁles in Fig. 6, in
which the ﬁelds tend to increase near the metal regions.
With the increase of the power, the modes move gradu-
ally from plasmonic type to solitonic type: S0-plas to S0-
solII (for the fundamental symmetric mode), AS1-plas to
AS1-solI (for the asymmetric mode), and S0-plas to AN0-
solI (for the antisymmetric mode), in which the soliton
peaks emerge near the interfaces, and when the soliton
peaks are far enough from the metal regions, the losses
start to decrease. The symmetric higher order mode S0-
solI (see solid blue line in Fig. 9(d)), has lower loss and
the loss decrease with the increase of the power as ex-
pected due to the localization of the soliton peak in the
nonlinear core (see solid blue curve in Fig. 5(a) for an ex-
ample of such ﬁeld proﬁle). It is worth mentioning, that
the increase of the losses in Fig. 9(d), is similar to the
simple NPSW in Fig. 9(a). While, due to the inclusion of
very thin buﬀer layers dbuf = 10 nm, the behaviour of the
losses change at high power (where the ﬁeld proﬁles ex-

7

hibit spatial transitions from plasmonic to solitonic type
solutions), which proves the importance of the inclusion
of the dielectric buﬀer layers between the nonlinear core
and the metal regions in the simple NPSW.

V. STABILITY STUDY FOR TM WAVES

In this section we study the stability properties for
the TM waves in the most signiﬁcant cases. In a previ-
ous work, using two diﬀerent numerical methods includ-
ing the FDTD, we have already shown that the results
about the stability of the main symmetric and asymmet-
ric modes derived in reference [28] from theoretical argu-
ments in the framework of the weak guidance approxima-
tion in nonlinear waveguides are still valid, at least nu-
merically, in simple NPSWs except just around the bifur-
cation point where subtle behaviours occur [27]. Here, we
have again used the nonlinear capabilities of the FDTD
method implemented in the meep software [29, 30]. The
metal permittivity is described by a Drude model to ob-
tain the ﬁxed negative value used at the studied wave-
length in the stationnary study. As it can be seen in

FIG. 10. Evolution during the propagation of the Hy ﬁeld
proﬁle for dcore = 300nm, dbuf = 40 nm. (a) S0-solI symmet-
ric solitonic type mode at a power such that h∆ni = 0.043
with εbuf = 2.52. (b) S0-plas symmetric plasmonic type mode
at a power such that h∆ni = 0.015 with εbuf = 3.22. h∆ni is
the spatial average along the core of the nonlinear refractive
index change [6, 27], other parameters as in the text.

Fig. 10(a), for the improved NPSW, the symmetric mode
S0-solI is stable at low power. The S0-plas mode (plas-
monic type) is also stable as it is depicted in Fig. 10(b).
The asymmetric mode AS1-solI is also stable for the
tested powers above the bifurcation threshold (data not
shown). Due to the losses of the metal, and as pointed
out in [27, 31], the temporal nonlinear solutions are actu-
ally not self-coherent [26] as it can be seen in Fig. 10 with
the decrease of the ﬁeld intensity along the propagation.

VI. TE STATIONARY WAVES

In this section we study the transverse electric TE po-
larized waves in the improved structure depicted in Fig. 1.

In this case the electromagnetic ﬁelds have only three
nonzero components Ey, Hx, and Hz. The only nonzero
component of the electric ﬁeld is the longitudinal compo-
nent Ey. Consequently, the TE surface plasmon waves
do not exist in isotropic planar linear metal/dielectric
structures. However, the fundamental transverse electric
mode for linear (metal/dielectric/metal) structures exists
if the core width is beyond a cut-oﬀ thickness [32, 37].
For this mode, the maximum intensity is located in the
core of the waveguide, thus losses in the TE case are
much smaller than their counterparts in the TM case in
which the ﬁeld penetrates into the metal.

VI.1. Linear TE case

As we saw in Sec. III.1 for the TM case, the linear
case is a fundamental step in understanding the nonlinear
behaviour. For this reason, we start by the linear case in
our study of the TE modes. In Fig. 11, we compare the
fundamental symmetric linear proﬁles for both TM and
TE waves for two diﬀerent values of dbuf . We choose
the core thickness dcore = 400 nm, which is above the
cut-oﬀ core thickness of the symmetric linear TE mode
(there is no cut-oﬀ thickness for the linear TM mode).
The linear TE mode being core localized for small values
of dbuf , even for large dbuf it stays core localized (see
Fig. 11(b) and (d)). Consequently, unlike the TM mode,
it does not exhibit any spatial transition as a function
of dbuf . While, for the TM case (see Fig. 11(a) and (c))
the buﬀer layer thicknesses dbuf , play an important role
in distinguishing between two diﬀerent types of modes
(plasmonic and core localized modes) as we mentioned
before in Sec. III.1.

for the fundamental symmetric linear TE mode S0-TE
(see Fig. 11(b) and (d) for an example of such ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle) are given in Fig. 12 and 13, respectively, as a function
of the core thickness dcore for ﬁve diﬀerent values of dbuf .
For each value of dbuf , there exist a cut-oﬀ thickness for
dcore such that below this value the fundamental sym-
metric linear TE mode does not exit. The cut-oﬀ core
thickness decreases with the increase of the buﬀer layer
thicknesses dbuf such that the black curve (which repre-
sents the results obtained of the improved structure by
removing the supplementary buﬀer layers i.e the simple
NPSW) has the highest cut-oﬀ core thickness ≈ 172 nm,
while the dark green curve has the lowest cut-oﬀ value
≈ 40 nm for dbuf = 100 nm.
It is worth mentioning
that, for dcore > 600 nm all the curves merge together
regardless the value of the buﬀer thicknesses, because
the core becomes very thick and the S0-TE mode moves
away from the metal cladding.
In Fig. 13, we show the

mode S0-TE with the corresponding propagation length
Lp. The meaning of this ﬁgure is similar to Fig. 12. The
solid curves for Im(nef f ) and the dashed ones for the
propagation length Lp = λ/ (4πIm(nef f )). For a ﬁxed
value of dcore, the improved structure supports a fun-
damental symmetric linear TE mode with longer prop-
agation length than the one obtained from the simple
structure. The dark green curve (for dbuf = 100 nm),
has the longest propagation length and the black curve
has the shortest propagation length (for dbuf = 0.0 nm).

VI.2. Nonlinear TE case

In this part, we study the nonlinear dispersion curves
for the improved NPSW depicted in Fig. 1, for TE po-
larized waves. In Subsec. VI.1, we have shown that, as
soon as the cut-oﬀ core thickness is exceeded, the supple-
mentary buﬀer layers for the TE case have no signiﬁcant
eﬀects on the linear ﬁeld proﬁles, unlike the TM case, as
it is shown in Fig. 11(b) and (d). Nevertheless, the in-
clusion of the linear buﬀer layers between the nonlinear
core and the metal regions allows us to reduce the cut-oﬀ
thickness of dcore for the fundamental symmetric linear
TE mode (see Fig. 12), and to increase its propagation
length (see Fig. 13). For the nonlinear TE case, we con-
sider dcore = 400 nm, εbuf = 2.52, and dbuf = 15 nm
(for the other parameters see Sec. II), these parameters
are used for linear ﬁeld proﬁle shown in Fig. 11(b). We
chose the core thickness dcore = 400 nm to be above the
cut-oﬀ thickness which is ≈ 147 nm for these parameters
(see green curve in Figs. 12 and 13). The only non-zero
component of the electric ﬁeld is the continuous com-
ponent Ey therefore, the nonlinear permittivity of Kerr-
type in the core is written as εcore = εl,core +α|Ey|2, with
α > 0 (focusing nonlinearity). We use the ﬁxed power
algorithm in the FEM [19, 22, 24] to compute the non-
linear dispersion curves and the associated ﬁeld proﬁles,
in which the input is the total power and the outputs are
the eﬀective index and the corresponding ﬁeld component
(Ey(x) in this case).

In Fig. 14, we present the nonlinear dispersion diagram
for the main nonlinear TE modes in the improved NPSW.
The global shape of this diagram is similar to the ones ob-
tained for the TM case such that the relative positions of
the three main modes are preserved. However, the ﬁeld
proﬁles are diﬀerent. The blue, green, and red curves
represent the symmetric, asymmetric, and antisymmet-
ric nonlinear TE modes, respectively. The ﬁeld proﬁles
for the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-TE are given in
Fig. 15(a), (b), and (c) in which the intensity is located
in the middle of the waveguide without any plasmonic
tails at the interfaces between the linear buﬀer layers
and the metal regions. The antisymmetric ﬁeld proﬁles
are depicted in Fig. 16(d), (e), and (f).

Due to the nonlinearity, the nonlinear asymmetric
mode (denoted by AS1-TE), bifurcates at a critical value

and dbuf = 15 nm.

of the power through a Hopf bifurcation from the nonlin-
ear symmetric mode S0-TE (see the green and the blue
curves in Fig. 14). The nonlinear asymmetric mode AS1-
TE proﬁles are shown in Fig. 16(a), (b), and (c) in which
the mode is shifted-oﬀ the slot center and moves to one
of the interfaces (we remind that the asymmetric mode
is doubly degenerated). This kind of Hopf bifurcation
is similar to the ones obtained for the TM wave both
for the improved NPSW (see Fig. 3) and for the simple
NPSW [18, 27].
If we compare the bifurcation thresh-
olds for the TE case (see green curve in Fig. 14) with
its counterpart in the TM case (shown in Fig. 3(c)) us-
ing the same parameters, we found that the asymmetric
nonlinear mode in the TE case bifurcates from the sym-
metric nonlinear mode at a higher power than its counter-
part in the TM case. Furthermore, in the TM case, the
asymmetric mode bifurcates from the symmetric plas-
monic mode S0-plas, and turns gradually to the asym-
metric solitonic mode AS1-solI as it is shown in Fig. 5(b),
while in the TE case, the asymmetric mode AS1-TE, bi-
furcates from the nonlinear symmetric mode S0-TE and
does not exhibit any spatial transition (see Fig. 14). At
high power, above the bifurcation threshold in the non-
linear dispersion diagram shown in Fig. 14, the nonlinear
symmetric core localized mode S0-TE turns gradually to
a nonlinear two-humped mode. We call it SII-TE (see the
blue and thick dark blue curves in Fig. 14), in which the
soliton intensity proﬁle in the core displays two peaks in
the middle of the waveguide. In Fig. 15, we illustrate the
modal spatial transition from the nonlinear symmetric
mode S0-TE (blue proﬁles), to the nonlinear symmet-
ric two-humped mode SII-TE (dark blue proﬁles). It is
worth mentioning that such kind of transition between
the symmetric modes has already been found in a fully
nonlinear dielectric waveguides [23] at high power.

In Fig. 17, we show the imaginary part of the eﬀec-
tive indices of the main TE modes with the correspond-
ing values of the losses. One clearly see that, at low
power, the antisymmetric mode has the highest value of
the losses (see Fig. 17(a)) because the peaks are closer

VII. CONCLUSION

We have presented a full study of a nonlinear plasmonic
slot waveguide improved by the addition of supplemen-
tary linear dielectric buﬀer layers between the nonlin-
ear core of Kerr-type and the semi-inﬁnite metal regions.
We have provided a complete description of its main TM
and TE modes for both linear and nonlinear case. For
the linear TM case, in addition to the symmetric linear
plasmonic proﬁle obtained in the simple structure (with-
out the buﬀer layers), our improved structure supports
two new types of linear modes; the core localized and
the ﬂat modes. These new linear modes are not found
in the simple symmetric linear structures whatever the
opto-geometric parameters used. For the nonlinear TM
case, we have provided the nonlinear phase diagram for
the existence and the type of the main TM modes. The
buﬀer layer thickness and the total power are used as
parameters such that, for a well-chosen opto-geometric
parameters, the main TM modes exhibit spatial modal
transitions which can be controlled by the power. We
have also shown that this structure allows a decrease of
the losses compared to the simple nonlinear slot waveg-
uide and that they decrease with the power for most
of the cases. The stability properties of the main TM
modes has also been studied numerically using the FDTD
method. We have also demonstrated the existence (for
some conﬁgurations), and studied the properties of the
main TE modes for both linear and nonlinear cases. This
kind of structure could be fabricated and characterized
experimentally due to the realistic parameters chosen to
model it.
