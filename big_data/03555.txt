Abstract

We present a source of polarization entangled photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric

downconversion engineered for frequency uncorrelated telecom photon generation. Our source pro-

vides photon pairs that display, simultaneously, the key properties for high-performance quantum

information and fundamental quantum science tasks. Speciﬁcally, the source provides for high

heralding eﬃciency, high quantum state purity and high entangled state ﬁdelity at the same time.

Among diﬀerent tests we apply to our source we observe almost perfect non-classical interference
between photons from independent sources with a visibility of (100 ± 5)%.

INTRODUCTION

Optical quantum information science oﬀers powerful techniques for secure messaging and

networking, processing and metrology, with signiﬁcant advantages over techniques based on

the laws of classical physics alone [1–5]. Photons also play a major role in fundamental

studies on the nature of our world [6–9]. An essential component for many optical quantum

techniques and technologies is an eﬃcient source of high-quality single photons or entan-

gled photon pairs. The ultimate goal is a deterministic and on-demand photon source, of

which development is ongoing [10]. One approach to building a deterministic source is the

networked switching of high-quality probabilistic sources [11, 12], such as heralded photon

pair sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). In the short- to

medium-term, heralded pair sources without switching remain the favored architecture for

modern experimental quantum optics because of the excellent capabilities they provide.

In this work, we demonstrate a very high quality SPDC source using periodically-poled

KTiOPO4 (ppKPT) in a polarizing Sagnac interferometer geometry.

In particular, we

demonstrate very high nonclassical (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference between telecom pho-

tons from diﬀerent sources, while maintaining high heralding eﬃciency (the probability of

photon detection once the other photon or the pair is detected). Our source can also be

conﬁgured to produce high quality polarization entanglement between telecom photons (also

with high heralding eﬃciency). It uses a femtosecond pump laser, providing advantages in

cost and simplicity over picosecond-pulse-length sources.

Our goals are motivated by the key requirements of photonic quantum information exper-

iments. The photons should be of high purity, so to provide high non-classical interference

visibility, which is a crucial component of most quantum state transformation circuits. High

heralding eﬃciency is essential for many applications, including loophole-free entanglement

certiﬁcation protocols. Alongside brightness, high heralding eﬃciency is a crucial ingredi-

ent in improving the practical scalability of multi-photon experiments which would require

multiple sources of this kind. These include protocols based on quantum teleportation and

entanglement swapping, the core components of a future quantum repeater. Additionally, a

precious resource that can be obtained from the pair source is entanglement in a speciﬁc de-

gree of freedom (e.g. polarization). Finally, in multi-photon experiments, photon pairs need

to be precisely localized in time, so the source relies on a femto- or pico-second pulse-length

2

laser pump, instead of continuous-wave (CW) pumping. Although each of these features

is achievable with SPDC, no optimal source conﬁguration that demonstrates all of these

properties has been presented so far. Here we report on a polarization-entangled SPDC

source in the telecom 1570 nm wavelength range, which provides all of these properties at

the same time.

For the last two decades, the workhorses of photonic quantum information and commu-

nication have been bulk crystal sources. The most common approach utilizes non-collinear

emission from type-II bulk barium borate (BBO) crystals, where collection from intersect-

ing downconversion cones yields a polarization-entangled state [13]. While these traditional

sources are still widely used for many photonic quantum information implementations -

most notably those concerned with multi-photon experiments - the past decade has seen the

development of a new generation of photon sources that exploit recent advances in nonlinear

optics.

Quasi-phase matching via periodic poling overcomes many of the limitations of angle

phase matched sources, i which include lower heralding eﬃciencies and lack of control over

spectral properties of downconverted photons. One can utilize comparatively long crystals

in collinear geometries, yielding both an inherently higher spectral ﬂux and higher collec-

tion eﬃciencies. However, unlike the traditional bulk-crystal sources in which polarization

entanglement is engineered within the emission cones, an additional step is required to

polarization-entangle the emitted photons.

In 2006, Kim et al. provided the ﬁrst demonstration of polarization-entangled photons

from a ppKTP crystal embedded within a polarizing Sagnac interferometer utilizing a CW

pump [14, 15]. It was further advanced by Fedrizzi et al., yielding a source that was simul-

taneously bright, highly entangled and widely spectrally tuneable [16]. In the CW regime,

Sagnac-based sources are rapidly surmounting traditional bulk sources, with the increased

brightness and potential for high heralding eﬃciencies allowing access to new and more

comprehensive quantum information demonstrations [7, 17, 18]. However, CW pumping is

incompatible with multi-photon experiments and the Sagnac architecture was ﬁrst extended

to the pulsed regime with narrowband pump pulses [19] and later in the non-degenerate case

of femtosecond pump pulses [20].

However, expanding the reach of photonic quantum information demands more than

brightness alone. Ambitious implementations concerned with interfering multiple down-

3

conversion sources are hindered by limitations in purity, indistinguishability and heralding

eﬃciency. In traditional SPDC sources, bi-photons are born spectrally entangled. Photon-

counting measurements insensitive to this spectral information degrade the purity and in-

distinguishability of the state. These spectral correlations are traditionally erased by harsh

spectral ﬁltering of the state at the cost of both brightness and heralding eﬃciency. A more

sophisticated approach to the problem is to instead directly engineer the process of down-

conversion itself to generate inherently pure bi-photons through group velocity matching

(GVM) [21, 22]. GVM was ﬁrst demonstrated in 2004 in the context of second harmonic

generation [23] in ppKTP, and has since been been used to generate spectrally pure photons

in bulk KDP [24, 25], bulk [26–29] and waveguided ppKTP [30, 31] and bulk BBO [32].

The direct engineering of both the pump and crystal parameters improves the spectral fac-

torability of the source, which improves the brightness and heralding eﬃciency by virtue of

avoiding extensive spectral ﬁltering. The source that we report on unites the complementary

ideas of brightness through quasi-phase matching and collinear geometries, and engineered

spectral purity and degeneracy. It also amounts to the ﬁrst demonstration of a Sagnac in-

terferometer to generate polarization entanglement in the femtosecond regime. This work

naturally divides into two parts. Following [33], we ﬁrst consider the spectral engineering of

the downconversion source to produce degenerate and factorable photon pairs at 1570 nm.

We then proceed to demonstrate polarization entanglement using a Sagnac interferometer.

We characterize our source’s performance with a number of tests, such as joint spectral inten-

sity measurement, state characterization through polarization tomography and two-source

Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference.

II. POLARIZATION UNENTANGLED SOURCE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION

SPDC is a χ2 non-linear process in which a pump photon of frequency ωp is spontaneously

split into a pair of daughter photons, by convention labeled the signal, ωs, and the idler,

ωi, with their individual frequencies constrained by energy and momentum conservation.

The two-photon wave function can be modeled as a integral over all possible frequency

modes [33],

where a†(ωs) and a†(ωi) are the creation operators of the signal s and idler i modes. The
correlation function f (ωs, ωi) represents the two-photon joint spectral amplitude, which

can be decomposed as the product of its pump envelope function and the phase-matching

function (see Fig. 1) ,

f (ωs, ωi) = N α(ωs + ωi)φ(ωs, ωi),

(2)
where N represents a normalization factor. The pump function is assumed to be Gaussian
with a width proportional to the spectral bandwidth of the pump ﬁeld. For a central

frequency ωp and bandwidth σp, the pump function is given by

α(ωs + ωi) = exp

.

In the collinear case, the phase matching function is a sinc function with a width inversely

proportional to the length of the crystal and can be expressed as

In

this work, the joint spectral amplitude (JSA), pair collection probabilities, heralding ratios

and spectral purity are theoretically modeled following the theoretical work of Bennink [33]

regarding collinear SPDC. Among various literature, the use of Sellmeier equations obtained

from [34, 35] in combination with the thermal expansion described in [36] provided us the

theoretical predictions that were in strong agreement with our experimental results. We also

note that recently, a new tool for SPDC parameters calculation has appeared online [37].

To create a factorable JSA as shown in Fig. 1(c) we must meet three conditions. Firstly,
the peak contour of the phase matching function, deﬁned by kp(ωs + ωi) − ks(ωs) − ki(ωi) −
2π
= 0, must be aligned perpendicular to the ﬁxed 45◦ pump function (Fig. 1(a)), therefore
Λ
θ in Fig. 1(b) must be 45◦. Using the lowest order terms in the power expansion about the
center frequencies and assuming perfect phase matching at the center frequencies ωj, we are
s(ωs − ωs), k(cid:48) = ∂k/∂ω, which can
left with 0 = k(cid:48)
be written as

collinear downconversion with a pulsed pump ﬁeld at 785 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 5.35 nm,

pumping a 2 mm ppKTP crystal with a poling period of 46.15 µm, phasematched to yield degen-

erate daughter photons at 1570 nm. The joint spectral amplitude f (ωs, ωi) is given by the product

of the pump and phase functions intensities.

where the group velocity is given by ν =

k(cid:48) , which corresponds to an optimal degenerate
downconversion wavelength of 1582 nm for our KTP crystal. For practicality we consider

a center pump wavelength of 785 nm, resulting in a central downconversion wavelength of

1570 nm. This deviation will result in a slightly elliptical JSA, however will not make a

signiﬁcant reduction to the state purity. Secondly, the crystal length and pump bandwidths
must be matched. A 2 mm crystal length is chosen to match our Fourier-limited ∼ 140 fs
laser pulses, the spectral purity maximized by a pump bandwidth of 5.35 nm. Finally we

then select a poling period to achieve phase matching at these wavelengths, with a period

of 46.15 µm yielding degeneracy at 1570 nm at normal incidence and room temperature.

We experimentally implemented this design in the laboratory. We used a modelocked

Ti:Sapphire laser with a center wavelength of 785 nm to pump a ppKTP crystal in the

collinear geometry and with type-II phasematching, with experimental parameters as listed

above. We separated the (initially) co-propagating downconverted photons using a polarizing

beam splitter and ﬁltered away the pump beam using a dichroic mirror and a long pass

ﬁlter (Semrock FF875-Di01 [51] and LP02-808RU [51] , respectively). The photons were

coupled into single-mode optical ﬁbers with good mode matching, and were detected using

superconducting nanowire single photon detectors [38] with system quantum eﬃciencies
∼ 80 − 85%.

To conﬁrm the spectral factorability of the downconverted photon pairs, the joint spectral

intensity (JSI) was sampled via two time-of-ﬂight spectrometers [27, 39]. The group velocity

dispersion (GVD) in dispersion compensation ﬁbers (DCF) was used to temporally stretch

the downconverted photons, providing suﬃcient temporal resolution to resolve the spectral

correlations (or lack thereof) manifesting in arrival times between our SPDC pairs (see

Fig. 2(a)). The GVDs of our two DCFs were characterized by measuring the ﬁber delays with

a tuneable laser in the telecom band. The spectrometer’s resolution, limited by temporal

distance between consecutive pump pulses and the time bin size of the coincidence logic
card, are estimated to be ≈ 0.31 and 0.33 nm. Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) show a comparison of
our theoretically modeled JSI and our experimentally measured JSI. The results support

the frequency degeneracy and factorability of the bi-photon state. We note that we also

performed the characterisation using a crystal with a poling period of 46.55 µm, as reported

in [27]. In this case, we were able to experimentally achieve a degenerate spectrum only

when the crystal tilt was adjusted away from the normal incidence, an observation which

was also in agreement with our theoretical calculations.

The optimization of the pump and collection modes plays a signiﬁcant role in determining

the heralding eﬃciency, brightness and spectral purity of the source. As such, we ﬁrst

a comprehensive theoretical description of how the choice of pump and collection modes

in collinear sources requires compromises in heralding eﬃciency, spectral purity and source

brightness [33]. This theoretical work has since been experimentally supported [40]. To

optimize the source heralding eﬃciency we concede brightness and select a pump waist of

115 µm, and signal and idler waists of 50 µm, yielding a theoretical upper-bound of our

heralding eﬃciency of 96% excluding all optical and detection losses.

The chosen parameters were implemented with measured raw symmetric heralding ef-

ﬁciencies (we use the deﬁnition of Klyshko eﬃciency [41], i.e. the ratio between detected
two-fold coincidences over singles of the heralding arm) of up to (64 ± 2)% for both the
signal and idler modes. The primary source of loss in this conﬁguration remains the non-

unit quantum eﬃciency of the superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs).

Straightforward gains can be made to the existing heralding eﬃciency with better quality

optical coatings and background ﬁltering and with improvements in the ﬁber coupling setup.

III. SOURCES OF POLARIZATION ENTANGLED PHOTON PAIRS

To polarization-entangle our downconverted photon pair, the aforementioned source is

embedded within a polarizing Sagnac interferometer, detailed in Fig. 3.

In this conﬁgu-

ration, a diagonally polarized pump beam is split into its horizontally (transmitted) and

vertically (reﬂected) polarized components on a dual-wavelength polarizing beam splitter

(PBS). The two orthogonally polarized pump (labeled as transmitted and reﬂected from

PBS) ﬁelds propagate in opposing directions around the Sagnac, bi-directionally pumping

the ppKTP crystal centered within the Sagnac loop. The dual-wavelength half-wave plate

(HWP) between the reﬂected port and the crystal serves to rotate the linear polarization

of the reﬂected pump ﬁeld to horizontal for downconversion and to rotate the polarization
state of the downconverted photons in the transmitted propagating path by 90◦ to com-
pensate for any temporal walk oﬀ. The two counter-propagating downconversion modes are

then combined at the dual-wavelength PBS, erasing any distinguishing path information. It

should be noted that as the signal (idler) photon is interfered with its counter-propagating

signal (idler), the degeneracy of the source should have little eﬀect on the quality of the

entanglement. The space constraints of our current-generation Sagnac conﬁguration lim-

8

ited our choice of focusing Lf and collimating Lc lenses, so the pump-collection waists used

in the generation of source were less optimal compared to the unentangled conﬁguration.
We have achieved the symmetric heralding eﬃciencies of (45 ± 2)% for the pump waist of
90 µm, and signal and idler waists of 70 µm, which was improved to (52 ± 2)%, once the
pump waits was set to 100 µm. Other reasons for the reduced eﬃciency, compared to the

unentangled conﬁguration, were the higher number of optical components involved in the

setup and increased ellipticity of the pump beam that reduced the mode matching with the

optical ﬁber. We expect higher heralding eﬃciencies in the future with a new layout design

that would account for these imperfections and limitations.

The femtosecond regime of this Sagnac implementation relaxes a few conditions that are

relevant for picosecond and CW implementations. The large bandwidth means the spectral

degeneracy of the source is largely insensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations in the crystal,

simplifying two-photon interference between independent sources. Spectral mismatch was

suggested as the dominant limitation in a previous demonstrations [42]. As our poling
period of 46.15 µm is phasematched for degenerate downconversion at 1570 nm at 20◦C, our
two-photon interference does not require any active temperature stabilization.

After assembling two Sagnac sources, we have characterized the quality of the produced

entangled state. Quantum state tomography [43] was used to characterize the polarization
entanglement of the state. We consider: the ﬁdelity F = (cid:104)Ψ−| ˆρ|Ψ−(cid:105) of the reconstructed
(|H, V (cid:105)−
two-photon density matrix ρ with the maximally entangled singlet state, |Ψ−(cid:105) = 1√
|V, H(cid:105)); the tangle; and the state purity, as three important parameters [44] of the state we
produced. The measurements were performed for two cases, as reported in Table 1. For the

2

ﬁrst case, no ﬁltering was applied, besides the 50 nm broad bandpass BBP ﬁlters (Alluxa

1575-50 OD4 [51]), which were used to block the residual pump and luminescence from

optical components and did not aﬀect our two- and four-fold coincidence rates. In second

case, we have applied bandpass ﬁlters with a nominal FWHM of 8 nm (Semrock NIR01-

1570/3-25 [51] ) to our downconverted photons. While the unﬁltered case has demonstrated

the high quality of our prepared state, we observe further improvement when additional

ﬁltering is applied, though at the cost of a reduced heralding eﬃciency approximately by

half. We observe similar results in the quality of our two-source (i.e. independent-photon)

two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility measurement, shown in Fig. 4. Without additional

spectral ﬁltering, the theoretical purity of the engineered single-photon source for our chosen

laser (81 MHz repetition rate, 785 nm wavelength and ∼ 140 fs pulse length) provides our pump

light. The polarizing Sagnac loop comprises a dual-wavelength polarizing beam splitter (PBS), a

dual-wavelength half-wave plate (HWP) and a 2 mm ppKTP crystal (poling period 46.15 µm, from

Raicol [51]). The femtosecond laser pulses are ﬁrst passed through an optical isolator and Glan-

Taylor polarizer (GT) and any residual astigmatism is corrected by a pair of cylindrical lenses.

The pump light is focused though a focusing lens (Lf ) before being guided into the Sagnac loop

by mirrors (M) and a dichoric mirror (DM). The dual-wavelength HWP immediately before the
dual-wavelength PBS is set at 22.5◦ for symmetric bi-directional pumping of the crystal. The
internal dual-wavelength HWP is set to 45◦. The downconverted photons are collimated through

Lc lenses and the pump light and luminescence from optical components is ﬁltered out with 50 nm

broad bandpass ﬁlters (BBP) centered at 1575 nm.

parameters is 84% due to the sinc function side lobes of the JSI, as shown in Fig. 1(c). For the
unﬁltered state we observe a two-photon 4-fold interference visibility of (82±2)% (Fig. 4(b)),
which improves to (100±5)% with the addition of the 8 nm bandpass ﬁlters in the interfering
arms only (Fig. 4(c)). These visibilities were calculated from raw data without taking into
account the imperfect splitting ratio of the 50 : 50 (average measured is ≈ 48 : 52) beam
splitter used in the interference setup and without any type of background subtraction.

For the ﬁltered case, an average interference visibility, calculated from multiple repeated

measurements iterations was found to be > 95%, with the drop in visibility being mainly
attributed to the temperature variations (±1◦C) of the laboratory environment. Once the
temperature stability was improved we were repeatedly observing HOM interference with the

average visibilities between 99% and 100%. This is currently the best repeatable two-source

photon interference observed that we are aware of for conventional [45, 46] and telecom

group velocity matched [42] sources. While we still require ﬁlters to increase our overall

source purity beyond the limit of 84%, recent work propose directly engineering a Gaussian

phase-matching function through sophisticated periodic poling, bringing the purity of the

bi-photon state close to unity with only the requirement of background ﬁltering [47–49]. A

reason for signiﬁcant improvement of interference visibility, over traditional sources, is the

presence of the group velocity matching condition which removes one of the two types of

These result suggests the large bandwidth of the downconverted photons limits the state

quality. An outstanding challenge for our source is the spectral ﬂatness of optical coatings

over wide frequency bands. The downconverted photons have a FWHM of approximately

15 nm, which means photons associated with the central lobe of the JSI appreciably exist

across a spectral bandwidth of approximately 35 nm. With the addition of a 8 nm ﬁlter

we observe a clear improvement in the quality of our downconverted state. This result

supports our main conjecture that the downconverted photons further away from the central

wavelength of 1570 nm are partially depolarized by the optical elements within the Sagnac

and measurement setup.
It is worth noting, however, that the ﬁltering we apply has a
signiﬁcantly wider pass band than the usual FWHM≈ 0.5 − 2 nm ﬁlters that are used in
most multi-photon experiments requiring high state and interference quality [45, 46].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, our results demonstrate the ﬁrst entangled SPDC source that simulta-

neously possesses high purity, heralding eﬃciency and entanglement. With these types of

sources, we have observed the highest visibility of non-classical interference between two

independent photon sources, to date. While spectral mismatch was suggested as the dom-

inant limitation in a previous demonstrations [50], the femtosecond regime of this Sagnac

implementation relaxes a few conditions relevant for picosecond and CW implementations.

The large bandwidth of the pump and downconverted photons means the spectral degen-

eracy of the source is largely insensitive to small frequency mismatches and phasemathcing

temperature ﬂuctuations. Additionally, downconversion at telecom wavelength, where high

eﬃciency SNSPDs perform optimally, makes this source a perfect candidate for long-distance

quantum communication experiments.
