Abstract. We completely determine the intersection cohomology
of the Satake compactiﬁcations ASat
, except for
IH 10(ASat
). We also determine all the ingredients appearing in
the decomposition theorem applied to the map from a toroidal
compactiﬁcation to the Satake compactiﬁcation in these genera.
As a byproduct we obtain in addition several results about the
intersection cohomology of the link bundles involved.

1. Introduction

Intersection cohomology is a powerful concept for understanding the
topology of algebraic varieties. A case of particular interest, which
has attracted many authors, is to study the intersection cohomology of
compactiﬁcations of locally symmetric spaces Z = Γ\D. Indeed, inter-
section cohomology is only one of several possible, highly interesting,
cohomology theories which play a role here, and it is exactly the re-
lationship between these cohomology theories which has been studied
extensively. One highlight is the proof, given independently by Looi-
jenga [Lo1] and Saper-Stern [SaSt], of Zucker’s conjecture stating that
the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactiﬁcation Z BB is
canonically isomorphic to the L2-cohomology of Z. Here, and through-
out the paper, we always assume that we work with middle perver-
sity. Goresky, Harder and MacPherson further introduced the concept
of weighted cohomology groups for arithmetic groups in [GHM].
In
this paper they also showed that intersection cohomology groups are
canonically isomorphic to certain weighted cohomology groups. Due

to the work of these, and other authors, there is a wealth of infor-
mation on these cohomology theories and their relationship to each
other. In great contrast, however, very little is known about explicit
calculations of these cohomology groups, a fact that is not surprising
given the highly complicated construction of the cohomology theories
Indeed, to our knowledge there are only very few explicit
involved.

2 (n) of
the Satake-Baily-Borel compactiﬁcation of the moduli space A2 of prin-
cipally polarized abelian surfaces were computed by Goresky, Harder,
MacPherson and Nair for n ≥ 3 [GHMN] and the intersection co-
homology groups IH ∗(ASat

determined by Hoﬀmann and Weintraub [HW].

The aim of the current work is to address this question and to present
concrete computations for the intersection cohomology of ASat
(with
no level structure) for g ≤ 4. We can summarize our results from
Proposition 7.1 together with Theorems 8.1 and 9.4 as follows

The main tool we use is the decomposition theorem for the smooth
toroidal resolution AVor
of the Satake-Baily-Borel compactiﬁ-
cation given by the second Voronoi compactiﬁcation in genus g ≤ 4.
More precisely, we actually determine all summands that appear in
the decomposition theorem. The reason why we cannot determine
dim IH 10(ASat
4 ) is the same why we do not know all Betti numbers
of AVor
: the missing information is the Euler number e(A4), which,
amazingly, does not seem to be known. Furthermore, we obtain the
following

agree with the numbers ibj given above for j ≥ 12 (see [HT2, p. 204]).
Along the way we also obtain a wealth of information about the

intersection cohomology of the links involved.

j

We will denote Ni,j the link bundle of Ai in ASat

for i < j. This is the
quotient of a real ﬁbration over a level cover Ai(n) by some ﬁnite group.
For a detailed discussion of link bundles see Section 5. As usual we will
identify irreducible local systems with irredcuible representations of
the symplectic group, which in their turn can be identiﬁed with Young
diagrams. We will use the standard notation Vµ for the local system
corresponding to the irreducible representation of the symplectic group
of weight µ, which we explain in detail in Section 6.

Then our knowledge about the link cohomology is summarized as

follows:

Theorem 1.3. The intersection cohomology of the links in low genus
is as follows:

where for each link bundle the cohomology above the middle dimension
is given by Poincar´e duality. For the intersection cohomology labeled ?
above, we only know its pairwise sums as follows:

IH6(N0,4, Q) ⊕ IH2(N0,3, V11) = Q,
IH4(N1,4, Q) ⊕ IH0(N1,3, V11) = V2,
IH6(N1,4, Q) ⊕ IH2(N1,3, V11) = V2.
IH4(N2,4, Q) ⊕ IH0(N2,3, V11) = V22,
IH5(N2,4, Q) ⊕ IH1(N2,3, V11) = V2,
IH6(N2,4, Q) ⊕ IH2(N2,3, V11) = V22,

where each identity is a an equality of local systems on suitable Ai:
the ﬁrst line is an identity of local systems (i.e. vector spaces) on A0,
the next two are local systems on A1, and the remaining three are

4

equalities for local systems on A2. Furthermore, all of the cohomology
IH∗(Ng−1,g, Q) for any g is completely determined in Proposition 6.2.

The proof of this theorem is a combination of a number of individual
computations which appear in our analysis of the contributions to the
decomposition theorem arising from diﬀerent strata. We will make ap-
propriate references throughout the text where these results are proven.
The amount of information on link cohomology, which we could gather
from our computations, came as a surprise to us. In particular, we see
no a priori reason for the vanishing we observe. In general, it is very
diﬃcult to compute the intersection cohomology of the (singular) links
explicitly from ﬁrst principles.

2. The decomposition theorem

The main tool for our computation is the decomposition theorem
for projective morphisms which is due to Beilinson, Bernstein, Deligne
and Gabber — see [CM3] for an excellent exposition. Throughout
this section let f : X → Y be a surjective morphism of irreducible
projective varieties. Let n be the (complex) dimension of X and set
Y i := {y ∈ Y, dim f −1(y) = i}. Then the defect of f is deﬁned as

r(f ) := max{2i + dim Y i − n | Y i 6= ∅}.

The map f is called semi-small if r(f ) = 0.

k=0 Sk into locally closed
smooth subvarieties Sk of increasing dimension sk, such that setting
Xk := f −1(Sk), the restricted map f |Xk : Xk → Sk is a topological

The map f deﬁnes a stratiﬁcation Y = Fk=ℓ
ﬁbration. The sets Uk := Fk′≥k Sk′ are dense open subsets of Y = U0

and there are natural inclusions αk : Sk ⊂ Uk where αℓ is the identity
map on Uℓ = Sℓ. We denote the intersection cohomology complex of
a variety Z by ICZ. Throughout this section, η will denote an ample
line bundle on X.

THE INTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF ASat

g

The main principles which govern the topology of algebraic maps
can then be summarized as follows, see [CM2, Theorem 2.1.1] for the
case when X is smooth and [CM3, Theorem 1.6.1] for the general case:

Theorem 2.1. Let f : X → Y be a surjective projective morphism.
Then the following holds:

(1) (Decomposition Theorem) There is an isomorphism in the de-

rived category on Y :

ϕ : Rf∗ICX

where i ∈ [−r(f ), r(f )].

pHi(Rf∗ICX )[−i]

∼=Mi

(2) (Relative Hard Lefschetz Theorem) There are isomorphisms

ηi : pH−i(Rf∗ICX ) ∼= pHi(Rf∗ICX ).

given by the cup product with the powers of the class η.

(3) (Semi-simplicity) There are canonical isomorphisms

where

pHi(Rf∗ICX ) ∼=Mk

ICSk

(Li,k)

Li,k = α∗

kH−sk(pHi(Rf∗ICX ))

are semi-simple. More precisely, there exist ﬁnitely many in-
decomposable local systems Li,k,β (which can occur repeatedly)
such that

Li,k

Li,k,β.

∼=Mβ

Remark 2.2. The isomorphism ϕ is not canonical. However the strat-
iﬁcation Sk and the summands Li,k,β are essentially canonical (of course
one can always choose reﬁnements).

Remark 2.3. An immediate consequence of the decomposition theo-
rem is that we obtain a (non-canonical) isomorphism

(3)

IH m(X, Q) ∼= IH m(Y, Q) ⊕ Mk<ℓ,i,β

IH m−n+sk+i(Sk, Li,k,β).

Remark 2.4. In the projective case it is enough for η to be f -ample
for the relative Hard Lefschetz theorem to hold, see [CM2, Theorem
2.3.3].

Remark 2.5. By the Purity Theorem [CM2, Theorem 2.2.1] the rel-
ative Hard Lefschetz isomorphisms respect the decomposition with re-
spect to the strata Sk.

6

SAMUEL GRUSHEVSKY AND KLAUS HULEK

An important case is when X is smooth, so that one can replace
Rf∗ICX by Rf∗QX [n] (in the literature this is then often simply written
as f∗QX [n]). In this case H ∗(X, Q) ∼= IH ∗(X, Q) and the intersection
cohomology IH ∗(Y, Q) becomes a direct summand of the cohomology
H ∗(X, Q), more precisely there is a (non-canonical) isomorphism

(4)

H m(X, Q) ∼= IH m(Y, Q) ⊕ Mk<ℓ,i,β

IH m−n+sk+i(Sk, Li,k,β).

From now on when talking about (intersection) cohomology with Q
coeﬃcients we will not write the local system, thus writing simply
IH ∗(X) or H ∗(F ) for IH ∗(X, Q) and H ∗(F, Q) respectively.

3. The mechanics of the decomposition theorem

In this section we want to explain how one can, in certain cases,
inductively determine the local systems which occur in the decomposi-
tion theorem. The process which we describe in this section seems well
known to specialists, but at the same time seems not to be explicitly
stated in the literature as such. It can be extracted from the proof of
the decomposition theorem given by de Cataldo and Migliorini via the
splitting theorem given in [CM2, §4.1].

From now on we consider the special case where f : X → Y is
a birational morphism of irreducible projective algebraic varieties of
dimension n, and we further assume X to be smooth. One can then
ﬁnd a Whitney stratiﬁcation

Y = Sℓ ∪ Sℓ−1 ∪ Sℓ−2 ∪ . . . ∪ S0

such that, setting Xk := f −1(Sk), the following holds:

(1) Sℓ is a Zariski open subset of Y and f |Xℓ

: Xℓ → Sℓ is an

isomorphism,

(2) The Sk are locally closed smooth subvarieties of increasing di-

mension sk = dim(Sk) < sk+1,

(3) Sk ⊂ Sk+1,
(4) For any k < ℓ the restriction fk := f |Xk : Xk → Sk is a

topological ﬁber bundle with topological ﬁber Fk.

Note that the strata Sk a priori need not be connected and that we
do not assume the ﬁbers Fk to be smooth (but they can be stratiﬁed
such that the restriction of f to these strata is smooth). In order to
avoid a surplus of notation we will assume in this section that the
Sk are connected. It will be obvious how to generalize this to several
components. From now on we will always write Fk for the topological

THE INTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF ASat

g

7

type of the ﬁber of such a ﬁbration, and will write Fk for the total
space of such a ﬁbration.

For any point x ∈ Sk we deﬁne the link Nk,x as the boundary of
a small neighborhood in a transversal slice to Sk at x. Since Sk is
assumed to be connected, the topological type of Nk,x does not depend
on x, and we will denote this by Nk. Varying x we obtain the link
bundle Nk over Sk. Finally, taking the intersection cohomology of the
links Nk,x we obtain local systems IHj(Nk) on Sk. Of course, the local
system is not solely determined by its ﬁbers, in applications it will be
important to know its global structure on Sk.

If k1 < k2, we can view Sk1 as a stratum in Sk2 and thus deﬁne
the link bundle Nk1,k2 with ﬁber Nk1,k2 = Nk1,k2,x being the link of Sk1
within Sk2. In this notation Nk = Nk,ℓ and Nk = Nk,ℓ.

Our aim is to understand which local systems occur in the decom-

position

(Li,k,β)[−i].

We ﬁrst recall Deligne’s sheaf theoretic construction of the intersec-
tion complex ICY given by the middle perversity extension. For this
one starts with the constant local system QSℓ and then forms repeated
truncated push-forwards. The result is a complex whose cohomology,
when restricted to a stratum Sk, is a direct sum of irreducible local
systems whose ﬁbers are intersection cohomology groups of the links
Nk. We obtain a collection of local systems as depicted in Table 1. We
also note that, as long as Y is unibranched along Sk, we can replace
IH0(Nk) by the constant system Q.

QSℓ. The ﬁrst step is thus to determine which further local systems
Li,ℓ−1,β[−i] occur on Sℓ−1. This can be computed, provided one un-
derstands the topology of the ﬁbration fℓ−1 : Xℓ−1 → Sℓ−1, with ﬁber
Fℓ−1, suﬃciently well; recall that we denote by Fℓ−1 the total space of
such a ﬁbration. More precisely, we have to compute the direct image
H∗(Fℓ−1) := Rfℓ−1∗(Q) and compare this to the truncated intersection
complex IHY on Sℓ−1. Let Hj(Fℓ−1) := Rjfℓ−1∗(Q) be the local system
given by taking j-th cohomology of the ﬁbers. For j ≤ n−sℓ−1 −1 each
local system IHj(Nℓ−1) is a summand of Hj(Fℓ−1). The irreducible lo-
cal systems Li,ℓ−1,β[−i] in the decomposition theorem (5) in degree j,
which are supported on Sℓ−1, are then all those irreducible summands of
Hj(Fℓ−1) which are not accounted for by the truncated collection of lo-
cal systems IHj(Nℓ−1) for j ≤ n−sℓ−1−1. This includes, in particular,
all irreducible summands of the local systems Hj(Fℓ−1), j > n−sℓ−1−1.
The shift [−i] in (5) of a new local system appearing in degree j, is
given by [−i] = −j + codim(Sℓ−1, Y ) = −j + n − sℓ−1. We will call the
local systems which are not accounted for by the truncated complex
IHY the new local systems on Sℓ−1.

It is now clear how to proceed inductively.

In the previous steps
we have accounted for the entire ﬁber cohomology H∗(Fℓ−1), as local
systems over Sℓ−1, either by contributions from IHY or by new local
systems. The next step is to study the ﬁber cohomology H∗(Fℓ−2) as
a collection of local systems on Sℓ−2. Both IHY and the newly found
systems on Sℓ−1 will contribute to this. To explain the contribution of
the new local systems, we consider a new local system G on Sℓ−1 that
is a summand of Hj(Fℓ−1) not accounted for by IHY . This contributes
to the total cohomology of X via the intersection cohomology complex
IH ∗(Sℓ−1, G), shifted by [−i] = −j + n − sℓ−1. This means that we
have to form the intersection cohomology complex ICS ℓ−1(G), given by
repeated truncated pushforwards and shifted appropriately. Table 2
shows the contributions which we obtain in this way on the strata Sk
for k ≤ ℓ − 1.
In general, at each inductive step we thus have to
compare H∗(Fk) with all the contributions which we have in this way
obtained from the previous strata Sr, r > k. The diﬀerence gives us
the new local systems that live on Sk.

Finally, one can reformulate the relative Hard Lefschetz theorem in
this situation. Recall that this implies a bijection between the local
systems Li,k,β[−i] and L−i,k,β[i] for 1 ≤ i ≤ r(f ). We can reformulate
this as follows.

Proposition 3.1. Let fk := dim Fk. For every new irreducible local
system arising from Hn−sk+i(Fk) for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2fk + sk − n, we ﬁnd a

4. The set-up for ASat

g

g

g

g : AΣ

g → ASat

We will now specialize the set-up of the decomposition theorem to
the situation for the moduli space Ag of complex principally polarized
abelian varieties of dimension g. Recall that the Satake (or Baily-Borel)
compactiﬁcation ASat
is a projective variety. Every admissible cone de-
composition Σ of the rational closure of the cone Sym2
>0(Rg) of positive
symmetric g × g matrices deﬁnes a toroidal compactiﬁcation AΣ
g which
admits a contracting morphism φΣ
. In this paper we are
primarily concerned with the topology of projective varieties. Never-
theless, it should be borne in mind that Ag and its compactiﬁcations
represent corresponding moduli stacks. These are Deligne-Mumford
stacks and the only stack property we make use of is that Ag, as well
as its compactiﬁcations AΣ
g , can be written as a ﬁnite quotient of the
level n covers by the deck transformation group Sp(2g, Z/nZ). We can
always choose Σ such that the level covers AΣ
g (n) are projective and
smooth for n ≥ 3. In this, and analogous cases, we use the terminology
stack smooth for (strata of) moduli spaces of abelian varieties which
are the quotient of smooth varieties by a ﬁnite group action. We will
exploit this in two ways. One is that in order to compute the cohomol-
ogy of AΣ
g (n) and
then take invariant cohomology. The other is that we can use these
level covers to put ourselves into a situation where we can apply the
decomposition theorem and the techniques of Section 3 to the map

g we can compute the cohomology of the manifold AΣ

and the second Voronoi compactiﬁcation AVor

In order to perform our computations we will make use of two speciﬁc
toroidal compactiﬁcations, namely the perfect cone compactiﬁcation
APerf
, both of which are
projective. We recall that for g ≤ 3 all known toroidal compactiﬁca-
tions in a given genus are equal (if one does not take blow-ups obtained
by subdivisions of the fans into consideration). Hence we shall simply
denote these compactiﬁcations by Ag for g ≤ 3 and we recall that these
are stack smooth. In genus 4 the central cone compactiﬁcation, which
is the Igusa compactiﬁcation, is the same as APerf
, and has a unique
(stack) singular point. The second Voronoi toroidal compactiﬁcation
AVor
is stack smooth and is obtained by blowing up the singular point
of APerf
, see [HT2] for details. Thus we can apply the setup of Section 3
, and to unify notation we set A4 := AVor
to AVor

g : AΣ

In order to make use of the relative hard Lefschetz, we need a rel-
atively ample line bundle for the resolution φΣ
, which
will play the role of η in the decomposition theorem. Recall that for
any g ≥ 2, the Picard group of APerf
has two generators (over Q),
namely the Hodge line bundle L and the boundary divisor D. The
Hodge line bundle L is the pullback of the Hodge line bundle L (we
will use the same letter for both bundles by abuse of notation) on ASat
,
where it is an ample line bundle. The divisor −D is relatively ample
for φPerf
In genus 4
we recall that the (rational) Picard group of AVor
is generated by 3
elements, namely the Hodge line bundle L together with two divisors
DVor and E, where E is the exceptional divisor of AVor
. If
is the blow-up map, and D is the boundary on APerf
π : AVor
,
. In this case we can take −2DVor − E
then π∗(D) = DVor + 4E on AVor
as a relatively ample line bundle for φVor
. For details we

classes to H 2i(ASat
, Q). These lifts are not canonically deﬁned, but we
will choose a compatible sequence of such lifts once and for all, which,
by abuse of notation, we will also denote by λi ∈ H 2i(ASat
, Q). This
choice will be irrelevant for our purposes. We remark that another
lift of the classes λi to ASat
g was constructed by Goresky and Par-
don [GP], but their lifts a priori only live in cohomology H 2i(ASat
, C)
with complex coeﬃcients. In fact, by a result of Looijenga [Lo2] the
Goresky-Pardon classes have a non-trivial imaginary part and thus do
not live in H 2i(ASat
, Q). Since, however, we prefer to work with rational
coeﬃcients, we will work with Charney-Lee classes.

and in fact there is no other relation between these classes. This rela-
tion follows from the fact that the Hopf algebra constructed by Charney
and Lee [ChLe] has no even Chern characters as its primitive gener-
ators. Note that the Goresky-Pardon classes, when pulled back to a
(stack) smooth toroidal compactiﬁcation, become the Chern classes of
the extended Hodge bundle, namely λi = ci(E) and relation (7) is well
known to hold both in cohomology (where we will work) and also in
Chow [vdG2, EV].

The tautological ring is deﬁned as the subring of H ∗(AΣ

by the λ classes:

Rg = Q[λ1, . . . , λg].

Using the fact that (7) is the only relation it follows that the tautolog-
ical ring is zero in degree above g(g + 1), is one-dimensional in degree
g(g + 1), and satisﬁes a perfect pairing with socle in dimension g(g + 1).
In fact, a basis of the tautological ring as a vector space is given by the

Recall that for any variety there exist maps H ∗(X) → IH ∗(X).
Moreover one can multiply cohomology classes with intersection coho-
mology classes, and the product IH ∗(X) ⊗ H ∗(X) → IH ∗(X) makes
IH ∗(X) into a module over H ∗(X). In particular it makes sense to
consider the λ-classes and their products as elements in IH ∗(ASat

g ).

Our ﬁrst observation is

Proposition 4.1. There is an inclusion Rg ֒→ IH ∗(ASat

the fact that the intersection product deﬁnes a perfect pairing on Rg,
which shows that the only relations among the λ-classes in IH ∗(ASat

As a consequence of the Proposition we can, and will, regard Rg as

contained in both H ∗(AΣ

The main technical problem with this approach is the non-neatness of
the group Sp(2g, Z), i.e. the existence of elements with a non-trivial
ﬁxed point set. As a result AΣ
g will always have at least orbifold singu-
larities, and the projections βΣ,0
g )−1(Ag−i) → Ag−i will not be
topological ﬁbrations. Both problems can be solved by working with
suitable level covers and taking invariant cohomology.

the superscript j whenever it is clear that we are working on a ﬁxed
component.

a component A(j)
(n) or to
itself. Let Gj
g−i(n). Again,
this group does not depend on j we will thus omit the index j and
simply call the group Gg,i(n). This group can be described explicitly
in terms of generators, see e.g. [GHT, Section 7]. It acts on the ﬁbra-
tion (12). Let Kg,i(n) be the kernel of Gg,i(n) → Aut(Ag−i((n)), in
other words the subgroup acting on the ﬁbers of (12). The quotient

Gg,i(n)/Kg,i(n) ∼= Sp(2(g − i), Z/nZ) then acts on Ag−i(n) with quo-
tient Ag−i. The action of Gg,i(n) can be described explicitly in terms of
the generators given in [GHT, Section 7], see e.g. [HT2, Section 5]. El-
ements of the form g1 and g3 act on the torus bundles βΣ,0
(σ)(n) either
by multiplication with n-th roots of unity on the tori or by translation
by n-torsion points on the universal abelian varieties.
In particular,
these elements act trivially on the cohomology of the ﬁbers. For the
elements g4 we have two possibilities: either such an element maps a
cone σ to another cone σ′, in which case it also maps βΣ,0

At this point it is useful to recall a basic fact about the cohomology
of local systems on Ag. When we speak about local systems on Ag we
mean, strictly speaking, local systems of the stack Ag or, in more down
to earth terms, Q-local systems or orbifold local systems. More pre-
cisely, a local system on Ag, or, equivalently for the group Sp(2g, Z), is
given by a representation ρ : Sp(2g, Z) → Aut(V ), where V is a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space over Q. Geometrically, the local system is
then given by the quotient V = Sp(2g, Z)\Hg × V . If −1 ∈ Sp(2g, Z)
does not act trivially on V , or at points in Hg which have non-trivial
stabilizer, the quotient V is not a usual local system in the sense of
a locally trivial vector bundle with ﬁber a rational vector space. We
can, however, think of V as a classical local system on the level covers
Ag(n) for n ≥ 3. The cohomology groups H j(Ag, V) are then deﬁned
as the Gg(n)-invariant part H j(Ag(n), V)Gg(n) of the cohomology of
V on Ag(n). To show that this result does not depend on the cho-
sen level n, one uses the level cover Ag(nm), which is a Galois cover
of both Ag(n) and Ag(m).
Independence then follows from pulling
back to Ag(nm) and taking invariant cohomology. A similar construc-
tion is also used for the intersection cohomology groups IH j(ASat
, V),
which we also deﬁne as the invariant intersection cohomology groups
IH j(ASat
g (n), V)Gg(n). The independence of the given level then follows
as above, using Proposition 5.1 below.

g

There are two types of local systems which will be instrumental to
our computations. To explain the ﬁrst type we have to go back to the
ﬁbration given by (10). These deﬁne local systems

(13)

Hq(F Σ,j

g,i,n) := (RqφΣ,j

g,i,n)∗(Q)

on A(j)
responding local systems Hq(F Σ,j

i (n) = Ai(n). These local systems can be computed from the cor-
g,i,n(σ)) for the submersions (12), which

THE INTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF ASat

g

15

i

i

can be determined using the torus bundle structure of these ﬁbrations.
Fixing again a component and thus an index j, we will now again drop
the superscript j from the notation. Using the stratiﬁcation of βΣ,0
(n),
given by orbits of the cones σ, one can construct a Gysin spectral se-
quence of local systems (with cohomology of compact support) whose
E∞ terms are the local systems Hq(F Σ
g,i,n). For this, we note that all
strata βΣ,0
(σ)(n) are smooth so that we can use Poincar´e duality. This
technique was also used in [GHT, Section 9] as well as [HT1] and [HT2].
The diﬀerence to these papers is that in our case we apply the Gysin
sequence ﬁberwise in order to obtain the ﬁber cohomology. By con-
struction, the group Gg,i(n) acts on the local systems Hq(F Σ
g,i,n). The
subgroup Kg,i(n) acts ﬁberwise and we can form the invariant subsys-
g,i,n))Kg,i(n). The group Gg,i(n)/Kg,i(n)
tem, which we denote (Hq(F Σ
now acts on (Hq(F Σ
g,i,n))Kg,i(n) and this deﬁnes a local system Hq(F Σ
g,i)
for Sp(2(g −i), Z) on Ag−i. By comparing diﬀerent level structures, one
sees again that this does not depend on n, and thus we have dropped
this index, too. It now follows from Proposition 5.1 that

(14)

IH ∗(ASat

g−i, Hq(F Σ

g,i)) ∼= IH ∗(ASat

g−i(n), Hq(F Σ

g,i,n))Gg,i(n).

We will make frequent use of this fact, often without stating this ex-
plicitly.

g−i(n) in ASat

The second type of local systems which we will use in our application
of the decomposition theorem comes from the link bundles N j
g−i(n)
of A(j)
g (n). Again these local systems are independent
of j and we will thus drop the index j and simply denote this by
Ng−i(n). Taking ﬁberwise intersection cohomology we obtain local sys-
tems IHq(Ng−i(n)). Again, we can take the invariant system with re-
spect to Kg,i(n), which then descends to a local system on Ag−i which
we will denote by IHq(Ng−i). Similarly, if we consider speciﬁcally Ak
m we thus obtain linear systems IHq(Nk,m). Note that we do
in ASat
not claim that this is the local system associated to the links of Ak in
ASat
m . The latter is not even well deﬁned because the topology of the
inclusion Ak ⊂ ASat
m is not constant at points of Ak, which correspond
to abelian varieties with extra automorphisms.

The following Proposition is fundamental for our calculations. As
we did not ﬁnd it explicitly in the literature, we will state and prove it
here for the sake of completeness. Let X be an irreducible projective
variety and L be a local system on an open subset U of X. We further
assume that there is a ﬁnite group G acting on X and L, in particular
we assume that G maps U to itself. We denote Y = X/G and V = U/G
and by f : X → Y the quotient map. Let K be the subgroup of H

16

SAMUEL GRUSHEVSKY AND KLAUS HULEK

which acts trivially on X. Then the K-invariant part LK of L descends
to Y , in other words there is a local system M on V with f ∗(M) = L.
This allows us to formulate the following proposition, the proof of which
was supplied by Mark Goresky.

Proposition 5.1. For any j, there is an isomorphism

IH j(Y, M) ∼= IH j(X, L)G.

Proof. We ﬁrst recall from [GM] that the map which associates to a
local system L the intersection chain complex ICXL deﬁnes an equiv-
alence of categories between local systems on U and certain complexes
of sheaves on X, which satisfy the axioms of intersection cohomology
theory. We shall use this and the analogous statement for V and Y .
At the same time this allows us to shrink the open set U and we can
thus assume that G/K acts freely on U.

We recall that the complex Rf∗(L) is deﬁned by replacing L by
an injective resolution, to which f∗ is applied. The group G acts on
Rf∗(L), and taking invariant parts we obtain a complex, which we
denote Rf∗(L)RG.
In our situation it is easy to describe Rf∗(L)RG
explicitly, up to quasi-isomorphisms. Since f : X → Y has ﬁnite
ﬁbers, all higher cohomology groups vanish on the ﬁbers. Thus Rf∗(L)
is quasi-isomorphic to the local system f∗L whose stalk at a point y is
given by

(15)

(f∗L)y = Mx∈f −1(y)

Lx.

From this we obtain Rf∗(L)RG ∼= (f∗L)G. The G-invariant part in
each stalk of f∗L is the equivariantly embedded stalk of M. Hence we
obtain on V the following isomorphisms in the derived category

(16)

M ∼= (f∗L)G ∼= Rf∗(L)RG.

We will now progress to intersection cohomology. From (16), and
using the equivalence between local systems on V and intersection chain
complexes on Y we obtain

(17)

ICY M ∼= ICY (f∗L)G.

Moreover, using again the equivalence of categories, we have an iso-
morphism (of abelian groups)

Hom(ICY f∗L, ICY f∗L) ∼= Hom(f∗L, f∗L)

and the action of G on f∗L and its decomposition into G-irreducible
local systems corresponds exactly to the action of G on ICY f∗L and its

THE INTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF ASat

g

17

decomposition into G-irreducible complexes of sheaves. In particular,
taking invariants, we obtain

(18)

(ICY f∗L)RG ∼= ICY (f∗L)G.

Clearly, ICXL satisﬁes the properties of intersection cohomology
and, since f is ﬁnite, the same holds for Rf∗(ICXL). Hence this is
an intersection cohomology sheaf and is itself determined by its re-
striction to V , which is Rf∗L ∼= f∗L. The latter, as we have already
seen, follows since f is ﬁnite. This implies

Rf∗(ICXL) ∼= ICY f∗L.

Restricting this to G-invariants and further using (17) and (18) we
ﬁnally obtain the following isomorphism in the derived category

ICY M ∼= Rf∗(ICXL)RG.

Taking cohomology gives the claim.

(cid:3)

The results of this section ﬁnally allow us to work essentially on ASat
itself, rather than on level covers. This will also be the way we present
our computations. The reduction to level covers is an essential step in
our computations, as it allows us to apply the decomposition theorem
for the case when the source of the map is smooth. From now on we
will use this reduction to level covers implicitly and not mention it
speciﬁcally in each step.

6. The first step: the link bundle Ng−1,g

Before proceeding to work out the low genus cases in complete detail,
we demonstrate explicitly how the above machinery works in the ﬁrst
step of the recursive procedure, that is over Ag−1 ⊂ ASat
. This is
to say, we now work with Mumford’s partial toroidal compactiﬁcation

not need projective varieties to apply the decomposition theorem, it is
enough that Apart

g−1(n) is the universal abelian variety. As this ﬁbra-

tion depends neither on j nor on Σ we will again drop these from
the notation.
It will now be more convenient to use notation closer
to Section 3, and we will thus relabel this ﬁbration as fg−1,g(n) :
Fg−1,g(n) → Ag−1(n), with topological ﬁber Fg−1,g and similarly for
the other strata fg−k,g(n) : Fg−k,g(n) → Ag−k(n), with topological

ﬁber Fg−k,g. Whenever g is ﬁxed we will further simplify the notation
by writing Fg−k = Fg−k,g, and will drop the level n when working with-
out level structure. Similarly, we will write Hq(Fg−k) = Hq(Fg−k,g)
and use IHq(Ng−i), respectively IHq(Nk,m), which were introduced
in Section 5. We also recall that for the decomposition theorem only
the intersection cohomology of the links below their middle dimension
plays a role.

g

The partial compactiﬁcation Apart

(n) is smooth for n ≥ 3 and the
link Ng−1,g(n) is simply the boundary of a slice of a neighborhood of a
ﬁber of Fg−1,g(n), transversal to the boundary stratum, within Apart
(n).
Globally, such neighborhoods form a tubular neighborhood of a com-
plex codimension one subvariety of Apart
(n), and thus the link bundle
Ng−1,g(n) is an S1 circle bundle over Fg−1,g(n) = Xg−1(n). We note
that this link is smooth and hence we can replace its intersection coho-
mology by ordinary cohomology. We also note that the cohomology of
an S1 circle bundle over the universal abelian variety can be computed
using the Leray spectral sequence.

g

g

At this point we must recall further basic facts about irreducible
local systems on Ag. These correspond to irreducible representations
of Sp(2g, Z), which in turn correspond to Young diagrams µ = (µ1 ≥
µ2 ≥ · · · ≥ µg) with at most g rows. Equivalently, we can view µ as
an arbitrary partition of length at most g.
If we denote by V1 the
standard rational representation of the group Sp(2g, Z) on C2g, then
the representation Vµ of Sp(2g, Z) is the irreducible representation of
highest weight that appears in the decomposition of the tensor product

into irreducible representations. Any local system on Ag deﬁnes a
local system on Ag(n) by pullback, or equivalently, by restricting a
representation of Sp(2g, Z) to the principal congruence group of level
n — and we will denote this local system by the same symbol. The
local systems Vµ are naturally a Hodge module of weight equal to the
i=1 µi of µ. We will, however, not use these weights

in what follows and thus not include them in our notation.

weight w(µ) = Pg

Recall that the cohomology ring of an abelian variety A is

H ∗(A, Q) =^ H 1(A, Q).

Varying the abelian variety A ∈ Ag, the cohomology H 1(A, Q) forms
precisely the local system V1. Here we simply write V1 rather than
V10...0 with g − 1 zeroes. We will adapt a similar convention also for

THE INTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF ASat

g

19

other local systems, dropping all the zero weights. This means that
the same symbol can denote local systems on diﬀerent spaces Ag, but
we hope that it will always be clear from the context on which space
we are working. For future reference we recall

Proposition 6.1. The local systems associated to the universal family
π(n) : Xg(n) → Ag(n) are given, for q ≤ g, by

q

(19)

Rqπ∗Q =

where p(q) ∈ {0, 1} is the parity of q. The local systems in the range
q > g are given by duality.

^ V1 = V1q ⊕ V1q−2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vp(q)

Proof. This follows immediately from the representation theory of the
symplectic group, see also [GHT, Lemma 4.1].
(cid:3)

With these preparations we can now compute the (intersection) co-

homology of the link bundles Ng−1,g.

Proposition 6.2. For q ≤ g − 1 we have

IHq(Ng−1,g) =(V1q/2

0

if q is even
if q is odd.

1

Proof. We recall that on a level n cover βΣ,0
(n) = Fg−1,g(n) = Xg−1(n).
1
(n)(σ) = βΣ,0
In this case we have only one stratum βΣ,0
(n) as there is
only one non-trivial cone in dimension 1. The link bundle Ng−1,g(n) is
an S1 circle bundle over Xg−1(n) and we can use the associated Leray
spectral sequence to compute the (intersection) cohomology. At this
point we can simplify matters by restricting to the invariant cohomol-
ogy. This is very easy here: the elements of the stabilizer of type g1
and g3 (see [GHT, Section 7] for this notation) act trivially on the co-
homology of both Xg−1(n) and the ﬁber S1. On the other hand the
element

(cid:18)A B
C D(cid:19) ∈ Sp (2(g − i), Z)

with B = C = 0, and A = D the diagonal matrix with diagonal
(−1, . . . , −1, 1) acts by −1 on Xg−1(n), and acts trivially on S1. Thus
its action kills all of the odd degree cohomology of Xg−1(n) and acts
trivially on the rest (as it should, since we know we are eventually deal-
ing with the universal Kummer family). The Leray spectral sequence
in the relevant range is thus given by Table 3 where we have depicted
the case that g − 1 is even. In case g − 1 is odd, the last column is 0.
The diﬀerential in the Leray spectral sequence is given by mapping
the generator of the ﬁber cohomology to the Euler class of the S1

tems on A0 and A1. However, note that the map φ2 : A2 → ASat
is

semi-small, i.e. r(φ2) = 0, and thus there are no non-trivial shifts.

We will now work out the details of the decomposition theorem and
investigate which local systems appear. The ﬁrst non-trivial step is to
consider the stratum A1 ⊂ ASat

quotient of a nodal P1 by the involution, and thus also a P1. We now
want to identify the new local systems that appear in the decomposition
theorem. Over A1, we see that the only part of the cohomology of
the ﬁber H∗(F1,2) that has not been accounted for by IH∗(N1,2) is
H2(F1,2) = Q, which is thus a new local system which appears in
the decomposition theorem. We have indicated this by underlining
this system Q, and in what follows we will always use this notation to
indicate new local systems, i.e. those which have not been accounted for
by contributions from the bigger strata. We also note that indeed the
new local systems supported on A1 must be symmetric around degree
2 by Proposition 3.1. On A0 this new local system Q on A1 contributes
IH0(N0,1) = Q to the cohomology of F0,2, accounting for H2(F0,2) =
Q. Thus there are no further new local systems supported on A0.
Comparing the cohomology of the ﬁber with the link cohomology, and
furthermore recalling that the intersection cohomology of N0,2 satisﬁes
Poincar´e duality for degree 5, we obtain the results on the intersection
cohomology of N0,2 given in Theorem 1.3.

Summarizing, in genus 2 the decomposition theorem gives us simply

H j(A2) = IH j(ASat

2 ) ⊕ IH j−2(ASat

1 ).

Since we know IH ∗(ASat
H ∗(A2) yields

jective, so that the kernel is the space of all non-algebraic classes)

3 , Q) → IH ∗(ASat

Proof. As before we really have to work on a level cover, but, using
invariant cohomology in the spirit described above, we will formulate
the entire discussion on A3 itself. We shall again use the decompo-
sition theorem, this time for the morphism φ3 : A3 → ASat
, and the
fact that A3 is a smooth projective stack. The cohomology H ∗(A3, Q)
was computed in [HT1], and along the way the cohomology of each
ﬁber Fi,3, and of the ﬁbration Fi,3 was also determined. We start our
computations on A3 ⊔ A2 ⊂ ASat

The ﬁrst column of this table is simply the intersection cohomology
complex on A3, and the second column gives its contribution on A2,
whereas the last column are the local systems that form the ﬁber co-
homology of the ﬁbration F2,3. The cohomology IH∗(N2,3) is given by
Proposition 6.2, and contributes in degree up to two, while H∗(F2,3)
follows from Proposition 6.1 (and also was determined in [HT1]).

As a result, we can identify the new local systems supported on A2,
which are underlined in the table above. Note that they are indeed
symmetric around degree 3, as they should be by Proposition 3.1.

We proceed to work over A1 ⊂ ASat

3

; the cohomology H∗(F1,3) was
computed, as local systems over A1, in the table in [HT1, Lemma 8].
In fact, all that we need from these computations is that H6(F1,3) = Q
and that H5(F1,3) = 0. The situation is summarized as follows

Here the ﬁrst two columns are the new local systems that appear in
the decomposition theorem over A3 and A2 respectively, and the third
columns indicates their contributions on A1, whereas the last column
gives the local systems that form the cohomology of the ﬁbration F2,3.
From this we see that the top degree cohomology of the ﬁber H6(F2,3) =
Q cannot be accounted for by the intersection homology of the links,
and thus gives a new local system Q[−1] on A1. By symmetry of new
local systems around degree 5 provided by Proposition 3.1, the only
other new local system on A1 must then be Q[1]. Summarizing the
contributions from the new local systems that we have found so far, we
thus get

All the cohomology above except for IH ∗(ASat
3 ) is known. Indeed, the
cohomology of A3 was computed by Hain [Ha], while the intersection
cohomology of ASat
2 we computed in the previous section. Denoting
rj := dim Rj
3 the dimension of the graded pieces of the tautological
ring, which by Proposition 4.1 is contained in IH ∗(ASat
3 ), the above
inclusion gives Table 4.

Observe now that in Table 4 the sum of the ﬁve bottom rows, i.e. of
the individual contributions to the cohomology of A3, is precisely equal
to the top row. It thus follows that the containment in (24) is in fact an
equality. Furthermore, it follows that IH ∗(ASat

the theorem.

Table 4. Decomposition theorem in genus 3

Combining (23) with the fact that the intersection cohomology of
N1,3 satisﬁes Poincar´e duality in degree 9 gives all of IH∗(N1,3) as
stated in Theorem 1.3.

Note that the above computations did not require us to compute the
cohomology of F0,3, as we could already ascertain that there can be no
further new local systems with non-trivial cohomology and that (24)
is indeed an equality. However, for what follows in genus 4, and for
the record, we would like to summarize what happens over A0. This
allows us to compute the cohomology of N0,3.

Indeed, the cohomology of F0,3 was computed in [HT1, Proposition
2.4] — and in particular, is zero in all odd degrees. The link N0,3
contributes its intersection cohomology in degree up to 5; the link N0,2
contributes its cohomology a priori in degree up to 2, but, as we proved
in the previous section, its only non-zero cohomology is in degree zero.
Note, however, that over A2 we have two new local systems, in degrees
2 and 4. Finally, the link N0,1 only contributes its IH0(N0,1) = Q,
for the two new local systems in degrees 4 and 6. Writing down the
contributions to H∗(F0,3) from the new local systems on the bigger
strata we thus get the following table:

IH2(N0,2) = 0 IH0(N0,1) = Q

4 IH4(N0,3) IH0(N0,2) ⊕ IH2(N0,2) = Q IH0(N0,1) = Q

We have omitted to mention the cohomology in odd degree, as it always
vanishes. Since there are no new local systems supported on A0, all of
the cohomology of the ﬁber must have been precisely accounted for by
the intersection cohomology of the links. Combining this with Poincar´e
duality computes all of IH∗(N0,3) as given in Theorem 1.3.

9. Computations of intersection homology in genus 4

In this section we use the decomposition theorem to compute all
of the intersection cohomology of ASat
, except in degree
10, and also to get lower bounds in degree 10. The machinery is an
extension of that used in the previous sections, and uses the computa-
tion of the cohomology of all the ﬁbers of the map AVor
4 done
in [HT2], while many of the needed links have already been studied in
the situations of lower genera.

and of APerf

We ﬁrst deal with APerf

. Recall that the singular locus of APerf
consists of one point, and the map AVor
is the blow-up of
this singular point, with exceptional divisor E ⊂ AVor
, see [EGH, HS].
Indeed, the exceptional divisor E is smooth, but we will not need this.
The intersection homology of the blow-up of a point is well-known, and
easily follows from our setup:

if 19 ≤ j ≤ 20
if 10 ≤ j ≤ 18
if 2 ≤ j ≤ 9
if 0 ≤ j ≤ 1.

4

Proof. In our setup, the stratiﬁcation of APerf
consists of the singu-
lar point and its complement. On the complement we have the local
system Q, and since the complex codimension of the singular point is
10, the link contributes to the ﬁber cohomology up to degree 9. On
the other hand, the new local systems that need to account for the
cohomology of the ﬁber H ∗(E) must be symmetric around degree 10
by Proposition 3.1. Since in degree 10 and higher all of H ∗(E) is new,
the new local systems in degree j ≤ 9 must then be H 20−j(E) by sym-
metry. Of course, since dimC E = 9, there is no contribution in degrees
0, 1, 19, 20.
(cid:3)

Using this and the computations of H ∗(AVor

) and H ∗(E), as done
in [HT2, Theorem 1] and [HT2, Theorem 26(1)], we obtain all claims
in Proposition 1.2, apart from the claim in degree 10. Further below
we will see that b10(AVor
) ≥ 19, which, together with b10(E) = 3 then
gives us ib10(APerf

) ≥ 16, as claimed.

4

We now proceed to compute IH ∗(ASat

4 ) by investigating the decom-
position theorem for the morphism φ4 : AVor
4 . As before, we
ﬁrst do the computation over A3 ⊂ ASat
, where the relevant cohomol-
ogy of the ﬁbration F3,4 is given by Proposition 6.1 and the (intersec-
tion) cohomology of the link N3,4 is given by Proposition 6.2. Again,
we have underlined the new local systems. At this point we would like

to remark that the degree 6 entry is a priori V∨
11. However, all symplec-
tic representations are self-dual, and since we are omitting all Hodge
weights, we can simply write V11.

Remark 9.2. This is the ﬁrst case where we have a non-trivial (not Q)
new local system appearing in the decomposition theorem, namely V11,
It will follow from our computations, however, that IH k(ASat
, V11) = 0,
except possibly in the middle degree k = 6 – since all the rest of the
intersection cohomology of AVor
4 will already be accounted for. We see
no a priori reason to expect this.

We now proceed to work over A2 ⊂ ASat

4

, where the cohomology of
the ﬁber F2,4 is given in the left-most column in [HT2, Table 8] (where it
appears as Rq
! (k2 ◦ k3)∗(Q)). We note that while at this point we do not
know the intersection cohomology IH∗(N2,4), we already know from
Proposition 6.2 that IH0(N2,3) = Q, IH1(N2,3) = 0 and IH2(N2,3) =
V11. Substituting these, and denoting ∗i := IHi(N2,3, V11), the com-
putation can be summarized as follows:

that IH2(N2,3) = V11. As a result, the new local systems supported
on A2 are Q[−3] ⊕ 2 Q[−1] ⊕ 2 Q[1] ⊕ Q[3]. Moreover, we can relate
the cohomology of N2,4 and the cohomology of N2,3 with coeﬃcients in
V11, as stated in Theorem 1.3.

Proceeding to work over A1 ⊂ ASat

4 , we need to know the cohomology
of the ﬁber F1,4.
In principle, all the necessary computations were
done in [HT2, Sec. 6]. There is, however, one diﬀerence.
In [HT2]
the Gysin sequence was applied to the strata β(σ) themselves, where
σ runs through all Sp(6, Z)-orbits of cones in Sym2
≥0(R3) containing
matrices of full rank. Here, in contrast, we want to apply the Gysin
sequence ﬁberwise to the ﬁbrations β(σ) → A1. Nevertheless, we will
see that all required information has already been obtained in [HT2],
and it allows us to prove the following proposition.

Proposition 9.3. The cohomology groups of the ﬁbration F1,4, as local
systems on A1, vanish in every odd degree, while the even degree ones
are as follows:

Proof. We recall that the stratum β0
over
A1 consists of ﬁve strata β(σ) of the toroidal compactiﬁcation, indexed
by the cones σ(3), σ(4)
II , σ(5), σ(6) in [HT2], which were relabeled in
a more systematic manner σK3, σK3+1, σC4, σK4−1 and σK4 in [GHT].
For each such cone σ we denote, as in [HT2], the ﬁber of β(σ) →
A1 by F (3), F (4)
II , F (5) and F (6) respectively, which have dimension
6, 5, 5, 4, and 3, and we will denote by F the corresponding ﬁbrations.
We list the cohomology with compact support for the various ﬁbrations
in (27) below. The entries for H∗
are given in [HT2,
Lemma 17] and [HT2, Lemma 19] respectively. The cohomology with
compact support of the total spaces of the other three strata over A1
was computed in [HT2, Lemmas 21,22,23], respectively. The proof of
each of these lemmas proceeds by ﬁrst computing the cohomology with
compact support of the corresponding ﬁbration F , as local systems
over A1, and then computing the cohomology with compact support
of these local systems on A1. For each of these ﬁbrations, all the local
systems on A1 that appear in the cohomology with compact support are
equal to Q, and its only non-trivial cohomology with compact support
is H2
c (A1, Q) = Q. Thus the cohomology of these ﬁbers in any degree is
equal to the cohomology of the total spaces of the corresponding strata
in degree d + 2. This immediately gives the values in (27), where we
have additionally included the respective Hodge weights. This serves

cF (4)

this is non-trivial and hence an isomorphism. Indeed, this is equiva-
lent to saying that the ﬁber F1,4 has no cohomology in degree 7, or
equivalently that the diﬀerential d7 in the proof of [HT2, Prop. 24] is
an isomorphism, which was shown to be the case on [HT2, p. 230].
Thus the total cohomology with compact support of the ﬁbration F1,4
is the sum of all the other entries, besides the two copies of V2(−2),
in the Gysin spectral sequence above. As the ﬁber F1,4 is compact, its
cohomology with compact support is equal to its cohomology, and is
precisely as stated in the proposition.

We now return to implementing our method to ﬁnd the new local
systems supported on A1 for the decomposition theorem for the map
φ4 : AVor
4 . Since all the odd degree cohomology of F1,4 is zero,
to simplify the tables we only write down the even degree contributions
from all local systems. Further using the fact that the only non-zero
intersection homology IHj(N1,2) and IHj(N1,3) are in degree zero, by
Proposition 6.2 and by the part of Theorem 1.3 on N1,3 that we already
proved in the section with genus 3 computations, we obtain

By Proposition 3.1 the new local systems are symmetric around de-
gree 9, and thus they must be Q[−3] ⊕ 2 Q[−1] ⊕ 2 Q[1] ⊕ Q[3]. As
before, matching the contributions over A1 from the new local sys-
tems on bigger strata to the local systems in the cohomology of F1,4
which are not new, allows us to deduce the results on IH∗(N1,4, Q) and
IH∗(N1,3, V11) as stated in Theorem 1.3.

We now need to deal with the ﬁbration F0,4 over A0 (which is simply
the ﬁber F0,4 over one point). This is the union of E (the exceptional
divisor of the contraction Ag[4] → APerf
) and the strict transform of the
ﬁber of the map APerf
over A0 , where the latter was denoted
βPerf
in [HT2]. The cohomology of the ﬁber F0,4 is given by [HT2,

Theorem 26 (2)], where this ﬁber was denoted β4: the only non-zero
Betti numbers are the even degree ones, and they are equal to

SAMUEL GRUSHEVSKY AND KLAUS HULEK

Similarly to the proof of Lemma 9.1 above, the new local systems ap-
pearing must be symmetric around degree 10 by Proposition 3.1. We
thus ﬁrst focus on understanding what part of the cohomology of F0,4
in degree 10 and higher can be accounted for by local systems on pre-
vious strata, and then use the symmetry to compute some intersection
cohomology of the relevant links.

We have already proven the relevant statements in Theorem 1.3, that
the only non-trivial intersection cohomology of N0,2 and N0,3 with Q
coeﬃcients are in degree zero.

The contributions towards H∗(F0,4) from the new local systems over
the other strata are summarized in the following table — where we omit
all the odd degrees since the cohomology of F0,4 is then zero. Again,
we can easily ﬁnd the new (underlined) local systems in degree 10 and
higher; by the symmetry given by Proposition 3.1 this also gives us the
new local systems in lower degrees.

Since all the cohomology H∗(F0,4) must be accounted for by the new
local systems and contributions from bigger strata, we get the state-

We have no a priori information about the last summand, but from the
computation below we will conclude from this that its only possibly
non-zero intersection cohomology group is IH 6(ASat
3 , V11). Otherwise,
all the intersection cohomology on the right is known from the previous
sections, except for IH ∗(ASat
4 ), which it is our aim to determine. Our

indicated the even degrees, as all odd degree intersection cohomology
groups involved are zero.

As a result, we see that in every degree except possibly 10 the sum-
mands above account for all of the intersection cohomology of AVor
, and
thus we must have IH ∗(ASat
4 ), except possibly for degree
10. This ﬁnally yields our main result in genus 4, as well as the inequal-
ity h10(AVor
) ≥ 16,
thus ﬁnishing the proof of Proposition 1.2. To summarize, we have
proven

Remark 9.5. In our computations for g ≤ 4 we have found that there
are no local system supported on A0 contributing to the decomposition
theorem. We expect this to be true for any genus g.
