(Dated: March 9, 2016)

Coupled atom-cavity arrays, such as those described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hubbard model,
In particular, the
have the potential to emulate a wide range of condensed matter phenomena.
strongly correlated states of the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect can be realised. At some ﬁlling
fractions, the fraction quantum Hall eﬀect has been shown to possess ground states with non-
abelian excitations. The most well studied of these states is the Pfaﬃan state of Moore and Read,
which is the groundstate of a Hall Liquid with a 3-body interaction. In this paper we show how
an eﬀective 3-body interaction can be generated within the Cavity QED framework, and that a
Pfaﬃan-like groundstate of these systems exists.

Coupled atom-cavity systems (falling under the broad
umbrella of Cavity QED) is proving to be an excellent
framework for the investigation of fundamental quantum
phenomena, due to the versatility and control of system
parameters. In particular, cavity QED is promising to
be a powerful platform for quantum emulation, where a
wide range of condensed matter systems can be modeled
through tailoring of atom-cavity interactions[1–6].

Recent work has shown how complex states of corre-
lated light can be induced in cavity QED systems via
non-linearities in atom-light interactions. In particular,
a class of states that correspond to the quantum Hall ef-
fect have been predicted. In this paper we extend this
class to include Pfaﬃan-like states[7]. These states pos-
sess highly non-trivial topological properties, that make
them of great interest to the understanding of quantum
Hall physics, as well as providing an opportunity to ex-
amine strongly correlated quantum states of light.

Since the discovery of

fractional quantum Hall
states[8], a small industry has grown up around the con-
struction of complex states that might be found in 2-
dimensional quantum Hall ﬂuids. These states (for the
most part) lie in the massively degenerate lowest Landau
level (LLL). Single particle states in the lowest Landau
level have a beautiful property that leads to the gen-
eral structure found across all the QHE states. One can
write the position of a single particle k in the 2D plane as
zk = (xk + iyk) /ℓB, with ℓB the magnetic length, then
the single particle states can all be written as a holomor-
phic function in zk, multiplied by a Gaussian factor. As a
consequence, all many-body states that lie in the LLL are
functions of ¯z = {zk|k ≤ Np}, and consist of a Gaussian
term, exp(cid:2)− 1
4 Pk |zk|2(cid:3), multiplied by a Jastrow Factor,
an analytic function F (¯z).

The Jastrow factor encodes the correlations between
particles. The simplest correlated state was proposed
by Laughlin[9] to account for the fractional QHE states
found at ν = 1/q. The Laughlin Jastrow factors are

FL (¯z) = Qk>j(zk − zj)q. These states have a wavefunc-

tion that vanishes as any two particles apporach one an-

other, minimizing the electron-electron repulsion within
the lowest Landau level.

The Moore-Read Pfaﬃan state is deﬁned by the Jas-

trow factor

ΨPf ∝ Pf(cid:18) 1

zk − zj(cid:19)Yk>j

(zk − zj)q.

(1)

The terms in the Pfaﬀain factor cancel a factor in the
Laughlin state, leading to a non-zero amplitude at the
coincidence of just two particles.

This ground state has

some interesting proper-
ties; most notably, non-abelian excitations, and (relat-
edly) a triply degenerate groundstate in the toroidal
geometry[7].

In this work we consider a Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard
(JCH) system with synthetic magnetic ﬁeld and demon-
strate the existence of Pfaﬃan-like groundstates at a ﬁll-
ing factor ν = 1. We ﬁrst consider the conventional JCH
system, and ﬁnd no evidence for Pfaﬃan-like states. We
then consider a three level Jaynes-Cummings (JC) cavity
and show how there are regimes in which 3-body inter-
actions dominate. We then study the conditions under
which Pfaﬃan-like states will arise when these 3 level
systems are Hubbard-coupled.

Each cavity in the JCH lattice is described by:

H JC = ωL + ∆σ+σ− + β(σ+a + σ−a†),

(2)

where a is the photonic annihilation operator, σ± are the
atomic raising and lowering operators, L is the excitation
number operator, ∆ the atom-photon detuning, β the
coupling energy and  = 1. The states |g(e), ni, where
n is the number of photons, and g(e) are the ground
(excited) state of the atom, form the single cavity basis.
H JC commutes with the total excitation number opera-
tor, L. Therefore the total excitations in the cavity, ℓ, is
a good quantum number. The eigenstates of Eq. (2) are
termed polaritons, superpositions of atomic and photonic
excitations, and are a function of ℓ and ∆/β.
The JCH model describes an array of

individual
Jaynes-Cummings cavities, which are coupled via a Hub-

bard like photon tunneling term. In the case of a lossless
system, the JCH model can be described by:

H JCH = Xi

H JC

i − Xhi,ji

κija†

i aj,

(3)

where κij is the tunneling rate between cavities i and j
and the sum over hi, ji is between nearest neighbors only.
For large detuning (|∆| ≫ β), eigenstates separate out
into either atomic or photonic modes. In this limit, the
photonic or atomic mode can be adiabatically eliminated.
Eliminating the atomic modes, the photonic mode has a
weak Kerr-type photon-photon repulsion[10] and the ex-
change of energy between atomic and photonic modes
is strongly suppressed. However, virtual processes lead
to eﬀective interactions in the photonic and atomic sub-
manifolds. Photons have an atomic mediated non-linear
onsite repulsion, making the JCH model equivalent to the
Bose-Hubbard (BH) model [11]. Atomic modes are cou-
pled with the eﬀective hopping rate κef f
ij = κij β2/∆2[12].
As the atomic modes are restricted to two levels, this is
eﬀectively a hardcore boson ﬁeld for atomic states, in
contrast to the weakly-interacting photon ﬁeld.

Investigation of quantum Hall physics in the JCH
model requires the introducion of a synthetic magnetic
ﬁeld. An artiﬁcial magnetic ﬁeld may be realized via the
introduction of some time reversal symmetry breaking
interaction. A number of techniques have been proposed
to achieve this[6, 13–17]. For example, one may exploit a
time-dependent potential to induce magnetic ﬂux across
the lattice[16], thereby explicitly breaking the time sym-
metry of the system. A similar strategy is proposed in
Ref. [6], where the authors utilize a time dependent inter-
site coupling to induce a synthetic magnetic ﬁeld. Alter-
natively, eﬀective coupling to real magnetic ﬁelds can be
used, such as in the proposal by Koch et al. [15]. Other
means, such as the use of optically polarized media[13] or
via atomically mediated inter-site coupling[14] have also
been proposed.

Inspired by results in ultra cold atom simulations[18–
21], one might expect to ﬁnd evidence of a Pfaﬃan
groundstate in the JCH model at ν = 1. We numeri-
cally investigated the JCH model on a torus to this end.
Existence of a Pfaﬃan like state can be indicated by a
number of properties of the groundstate: a triply degen-
erate groundstate manifold, large overlap with the Pfaf-
ﬁan trial wavefunction, and a Chern number of 3 com-
puted for the three groundstates.

We conducted a comprehensive search over several pa-
rameters within the JCH model, but the tell-tail signa-
ture of a triple degeneracy groundstate proved elusive.
Instead, simulations reveal that for some lattice conﬁg-
urations a single separated groundstate in the strongly
interacting limit, with a transition to a gapless phase as
the eﬀective 2-body interaction decreased. Other con-
ﬁgurations possessed a gapless groundstate extending all

2

the way to the hardcore limit. While these results jar
with the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ﬁndings, other
lattice boson simulations have failed similarly[22].

Although the evidence from BECs suggests that a Pfaf-
ﬁan groundstate should be preferred, there are other pos-
sible states at ν = 1 ﬁlling for Bosons which are in com-
petition with the Pfaﬃan state. For example, Read[23]
proposes a groundstate in which, approximately, a sin-
gle vortex is attached to each Boson. This assignment
exactly cancels out the external magnetic ﬁeld, which
reduces the problem to that of a Fermi-Liquid. Alter-
natively, it is conjectured[24] that a striped phase with
charge density order may exist at ν = 1, with some nu-
merical simulations[25] ﬁnding evidence for this.

The relativly small size of the systems we have sim-
ulated make it diﬃcult to tease out the importance of
diﬀerent eﬀects which determine the real nature of the
groundstate at this ﬁlling factor. However, the poor scal-
ing of these systems means that signiﬁcantly larger sys-
tems are impractical at this point in time. Of course,
this problem is one of the primary motivators of work
into quantum emulation.

For ν = 1, the Pfaﬃan groundstate is the high-
est density groundstate of the 3-body delta potential
Hamiltonian[26]. For each pair of particles, there is a
number of terms in Eq. (1) for which each particle is in a
diﬀerent partition. However, there is no term for which
3 or more particles coincide that does not vanish.

The JCH in the limit of large detuning can be described
by a Bose-Hubbard with an eﬀective two body interac-
tion, U2. However, the atomic-cavity interaction induces
interactions to all orders of n-photon interactions. These
higher order interactions are much smaller than the two
body interaction, and therefore the physics of the JCH
very much mirrors that of the Bose-Hubbard model with
two body interaction. We now show that it is possible
to eliminate the two-body interaction while retaining the
higher order interactions.

Three-body interactions (without corresponding 2-
body ones) are unnatural, and do not arise in many phys-
ical systems. A number of schemes for creating eﬀective
3-body interactions have been proposed in the context
of BECs[22, 27–29] and in the circuit QED setting[30].
Below we show that an eﬀective 3-body interaction can
be induced in atom-cavity lattice by replacing the 2-level
atoms in the JCH model with appropriately tuned 3-
level atoms. Furthermore, it is demonstrated via simula-
tion that an atom-cavity lattice consisting of these 3-level
atoms can possess a Pfaﬃan like state as its groundstate.
We consider the 3 level system atom in the Ξ conﬁgu-
ration, as shown in Fig. 1a). This conﬁguration consists
of two evenly spaced excited states, with the atom cavity
system described by the Hamiltonian:

H 3L = ωa†a + ǫ1 |e1ihe1| +(cid:0)β1σ+
+ ǫ1 |e2ihe2| +(cid:0)β2σ+

1 a + h.c.(cid:1)
2 a + h.c.(cid:1) .

leads to an eﬀective 3-body interaction. This can be seen
by considering the formulation of the JC system as a two-
mode Bosonic system with inter-mode tunneling. If one
imposes a hardcore boson condition on one of the modes,
then the system corresponds exactly to the JC cavity
with a two-level atom. In the single excitation subspace,
the hardcore condition is automatically satisﬁed, and the
system is simply a free boson model.

If, instead of the hardcore condition, one imposes a
3-particle hardcore condition (U3 → ∞), then a similar
situation arises, except that for both the single and dou-
ble excitation subspaces, there are no interactions. Map-
ping this model back to the atomic model, for 1 and 2
particles, the equivalent atom-cavity model corresponds
exactly to the one presented previously, where the factor
of √2 arises from the indistinguishably of the bosons.

The 3-body non-linearity is demonstrated in Fig. 1 b).
Here, the energy cost per particle for the lower polariton
branch is plotted as a function of the detuning, ∆. For
1 and 2 excitations, the energy per particle is the same.
However, for ℓ = 3 and above, there is an increased cost
for adding additional particles. Figure 1c) shows that,
at β2/β1 = √2 the 2 and 3 level atom-cavity systems
share several properties. The non-linearity is unbounded
as the detuning is lowered, and disappears as the detun-
ing is increased. Also, the non-linearity does not grow
quadratically with excitation number, as is the case for a
pure 3-body interaction, similar to the 2-level atom case.
Figure 1c) demonstrates how the two body interaction
is aﬀected by the strength of β2. As β2 is tuned away from
β2/β1 = √2 the eﬀective two-body interaction becomes

This method for generating 3-body interactions opens
up unique possibilities for investigating the physics of
topological quantum states that has proved elusive in tra-
ditional environments. Furthermore, this same technique
can be extended to higher order interactions. There is a
hierarchy of states that generalize the Pfaﬃan[31] state,
which are expected to be groundstates of these higher
order interactions. The JCH model with this modiﬁca-
tion is, to our knowledge, the only system in which such
higher order interactions might be achieved, outside of a
fully functional quantum computer.

In practice, engineering the three level system as de-
scribed lies well within the capabilities of current cavity
QED fabrication techniques. Engineering a system like
this in circuit QED has been discussed in [30]. For cavity
atoms, most Ξ conﬁgurations tend to be unstable, with
fast relaxation rates that would preclude large scale co-
herence in the system. This instability can be mitigated
by instead using an M like conﬁguration (as in [32]),
where classical driving can be used to create an eﬀective
three level JCH system.

In our simulations we restrict the system to a torus,
to remove edge eﬀects. The toroidal geometry permits
twisted periodic boundary conditions which reduces ﬁ-
nite size eﬀects, and allows for computation of the Chern
number.

The Chern number[33], C, is a measure of the topology
of the groundstate of the system and can provide evidence
for the existence of a Pfaﬃan like state. Here, we deﬁne
a two dimensional manifold over the two phases, θx,y,
that parametrize the twisted periodic boundary condi-
tions across the torus. For the Pfaﬃan state, the three
groundstates have a combined Chern number of 3.

We compute, by exact diagonalization, the low energy
band structure of the 3 level JCH system for 4 excitations
over the twisted boundary condition manifold [Fig. 2 a)].
For 4 particles there is a large modulation of the energy

With strong evidence for the Pfaﬃan state, we proceed
to investigate the 3-level JCH model in more detail, by
exploring the properties of the groundstate over a range
of lattice sizes and system parameters. These investiga-
tions are presented in Fig. 3.

In Figs. 3a) and c) we show how the groundstate
changes as a function of β2. The groundstate experience a
transition from the Pfaﬃan state away from β2/β1 = √2.
For β2/β1 > √2, where the eﬀective two body interac-
tion becomes attractive, there is a very sharp transition
to a collapsed state. On the other side, β2/β1 < √2, the
gap and Pfaﬃan overlap remain fairly stable, although
we observe a transition in the 4 × 5 lattice conﬁguration.
In Figs. 3b) and d) we show how the groundstate
changes as a function of the detuning, ∆. We ﬁnd that, as
in the case of the Laughlin case[35], increasing the atomic
detuning, which alters the eﬀective interaction strength
(Fig. 1b), can induce a transition from a Pfaﬃan state to
an uncorrelated one. This transition is accompanied by
a closing of the bandgap, and, for most cases, a dropoﬀ
of the overlap with the trial wavefunction.

The Pfaﬃan states at ν = 1 have a straightforward in-
terpretation as the symmetrised product of two Laughlin
states at ν = 1/2[36]. Assigning each particle to one of
two Laughlin states. The wavefunction will vanish as two
particles in the same Laughlin state approach each other,
but not if those two particles are in diﬀerent states. How-
ever, if any three particles coincide, then by construction
the wavefunction will be zero at this point. The three
degenerate states in the torus setting correspond to the
singlet and two doublet states one can construct from the
doubly degenerate Laughlin states.

This re-expression of the Pfaﬃan wavefunction also al-
lows one to translate ﬁndings from investigations into the
Laughlin state in the JCH into the current work. For ex-
ample, we ﬁnd that the detuning for which the Pfaﬃan
state undergoes a transition (Fig. 3b,d) is the same for
the equivalent single Laughlin state[35]. Furthermore,
the overlap with the trial Pfaﬃan wavefunction is very
well approximated by the overlap with a single Laughlin
function, to the power of two.

In conclusion, we have described a method by which
three-body interactions can be induced in Jaynes-
Cummings-Hubbard systems.
In the presence of syn-
thetic magnetic ﬁelds, such interactions, strongly corre-
lated states of light, with Pfaﬃan-like topological prop-
erties, will exist. This opens up exciting possibilities for
the exploration of exotic quantum states within the cav-
ity QED framework, including states with non-abelian
quasi-particles pertaining to topological quantum com-
puting.

as a function of the twist angles (which one expects to
dissapear in the many-particle limit[34]). We ﬁnd that,
a quasi-gap can exist in both models and computation
of the Chern number (C = 3), coupled with the 3-fold
degeneracy provides strong evidence for Pfaﬃan physics.

In the case of Laughlin states on a lattice, the gap has
been shown[33] to scale proportianlly to the ﬂux density
per lattice plaquette. This does not seem to apply in the
case of the Pfaﬃan state. We hypothesise that the ﬁrst
excited state of this system is not an excitation lying in
a higher Landau level. Rather, it is some combination
of quasi-particles and quasi-holes. These excitations lie
in the LLL, with no energy gap in the continuum limit,
which would explain the rapid decrees in the gap as the
ﬂux density per lattice plaquette decreases.
