On the Social Traits of LBVs

Roberta M. Humphreys1, Kerstin Weis2, Kris Davidson1 and Michael S. Gordon1

ABSTRACT

In a recent paper, Smith & Tombleson (2015) state that the Luminous Blue
Variables (LBVs ) in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds are isolated;
that they are not spatially associated with young O-type stars. They propose a
novel explanation that would overturn the standard view of LBVs. In this paper
we test their hypothesis for the LBVs in M31 and M33 as well as the LMC and
SMC. In M31 and M33, the LBVs are associated with luminous young stars and
supergiants appropriate to their luminosities and positions on the HR Diagram.
Moreover, in the Smith and Tombleson scenario most of the LBVs should be
runaway stars, but the stars’ velocities are consistent with their positions in the
respective galaxies. In the Magellanic Clouds, those authors’ sample was a mixed
population. We reassess their analysis, removing a duplicate entry and six stars
that have no clear relation to LBVs. When we separate the more massive classical
and the less luminous LBVs, the classical LBVs have a distribution similar to the
late O-type stars, while the less luminous LBVs have a distribution like the red
supergiants. None of the conﬁrmed LBVs have high velocities or are candidate
runaway stars. These results support the accepted description of LBVs as evolved
massive stars that have shed a lot of mass, and are now close to their Eddington
limit.

Introduction – Crucial Distinctions Among LBVs

Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) or S Doradus variables have attracted attention in
recent years for two mutually independent reasons. Normal hot-star winds cannot account

for suﬃcient mass loss (Fullerton et al. 2006), thus another form of mass loss, perhaps in
LBV events, is required for them to become WR stars. Second, the non-terminal supernova
impostors resemble extreme LBV outbursts (Van Dyk & Matheson 2012) and certain types
of supernovae were observed to have experienced prior high mass loss events that have been
likened to LBVs. (The role of eruptive mass loss was recognized before 1995, e.g.see references
in Humphreys & Davidson (1994), but has received more attention since 2005.)

Unfortunately, serious confusion has arisen because disparate objects are often mixed
together and collectively called “LBVs.” In a recent paper, Smith & Tombleson (2015)
argue that LBVs are not generically associated with young massive stars. They suggest
that LBVs gained mass from more massive companions in interacting binary systems and
subsequently moved away from their birth site when the companion became a supernova.
This would contradict traditional views in which evolved massive hot stars experience periods
of enhanced mass loss, in transition to a WR star or a supernova. Their argument is based
on their failure to ﬁnd LBVs closely associated with young O-type stars in the Milky Way
and the Magellanic Clouds. As we explain in Section 4.2 however, Smith and Tombleson’s
statistical sample is a mixed population and with at least two physically distinct types of
objects. When they are separated, the statistics agree with standard expectations. We
mention this example because it illustrates the need to distinguish between giant eruptions,
classical LBVs, less-luminous LBVs, LBV candidates, and others such as B[e] stars that
occupy the same part of the HR diagram. In this paper we explore those distinctions.

Since there are numerous misunderstandings in this subject, a careful summary of the
background is useful. LBV/S Dor variables are evolved massive stars, close to the Eddington
limit, with a distinctive spectroscopic and photometric variability. There are two classes
with diﬀerent initial masses and evolutionary histories as we explain later. In its quiescent
or normal state, an LBV spectrum resembles a B-type supergiant or Of-type/WN star.
During the “eruption” or maximum visible light stage, increased mass loss causes the wind
to become optically thick, sometimes called a pseudo-photosphere, at T ∼ 7000-9000 K
with an absorption line spectrum resembling an F-type supergiant. Since this alters the
bolometric correction, the visual brightness increases by 1–2 magnitudes while the total
luminosity remains approximately constant (Wolf (1989), Humphreys & Davidson (1994)
and numerous early references therein) or may decrease (Groh et al. 2009). Such an event
can last for several years or even decades.

There are two recognized classes of LBV/S Dor variables based on their position on the
HR Diagram. The classical LBVs, with bolometric magnitudes between −9.7 and −11.5
(log L/L⊙ ≥ ∼ 5.8) have clearly evolved from very massive stars with MZAMS & 50 M⊙.
Their high mass loss prevents them from becoming red supergiants (Humphreys & Davidson

– 3 –

1979). The less luminous LBVs with MBol
∼ 25 to 40 M⊙ or so, allowing them to pass through the red supergiant stage.

∼= -8 to -9.5 mag had initial masses in the range

Some factor must distinguish LBVs from the far more numerous ordinary stars with
similar Teﬀ and L, and L/M is the most evident parameter. LBVs have larger L/M ratios
than other stars in the same part of the HR Diagram. Their Eddington factors Γ = L/LEdd
are around 0.5 or possibly higher.1 This is not surprising for the very massive classical
LBVs. But how can the less luminous LBVs have such large L/M ratios? The simplest
explanation is that they have passed through a red supergiant stage and moved back to the
left in the HR diagram. Meynet & Maeder (2005) show that stars in the 22 – 45 M⊙ initial
mass range, evolving back to warmer temperatures, will pass through the LBV stage, and
recent evolutionary tracks, with mass loss and rotation (Ekstrom et al. 2012), show that
these stars will have shed about half of their initial mass. Having lost much of their mass,
they are now fairly close to (L/M)Edd. Although empirical mass estimates are uncertain, the
low luminosity LBVs are close to their Eddington limit with Γ ≈ 0.6 (Vink 2012). Hence
the evolutionary state of less-luminous LBVs is fundamentally diﬀerent from the classical
LBVs.

To illustrate this, in Figure 1 we show the evolution of L/M for two diﬀerent masses
It shows a simpliﬁed Eddington factor, Γs =

representing the two LBV/S Dor classes.
(L/L⊙)/(43000M/M⊙), as a function of time in four evolution models reported by Ekstrom et al.
(2012) for rotating and non-rotating stars with MZAMS = 32 and 60 M⊙. The 32 and 60 M⊙
models have log L ∼ 5.6 and 6.0, respectively, when they are in the LBV instability strip
(see Figs. 2 and 3). Three critical evolution points are marked in the ﬁgure: (1) The end of
central H burning, (2) the farthest major excursion to the red side of the HR Diagram, and
(3) the end of central He burning. For the 60 M⊙ star, Γs & 0.5 as it leaves the main se-
quence, but the 32 M⊙ star must pass through yellow and/or red supergiant stages before its
Γs reaches 0.5. Of course, these examples depend on the input parameters and assumptions
of the models.

In this case, then only the classical LBVs should be associated with young objects such
as O-type stars. The less luminous LBVs, more than 5 million years old, will have moved 50
-100 pc and are also old enough for their neighbors to evolve out the O star class. Among
other results in this paper, we ﬁnd that the data agree with this expectation.

One of the distinguishing characteristics of LBV/S Dor variability is that during qui-
escence or minimum light, the stars lie on the S Dor instability strip ﬁrst introduced by
Wolf (1989) and illustrated here in Figures 2 and 3. The more luminous, classical LBVs

1 For example, P Cyg and AG Car have Γ ≈ 0.5 (Vink & de Koter 2002; Vink 2012).

above the upper luminosity boundary have not been red supergiants, while those below are
post-red supergiant candidates. Thus LBVs with very diﬀerent initial masses and diﬀerent
evolutionary histories occupy the same locus in the HR Diagram.

No single cause is generally accepted as the origin for the LBV/S Dor enhanced mass
loss/optically thick wind events. Most proposed explanations invoke the star’s proximity to
its Eddington limit due to previous high mass loss. Proposed models include an opacity-
modiﬁed Eddington limit, subphotospheric gravity-mode instabilities, super-Eddington winds,
and envelope inﬂation close to the Eddington limit (see §5 in Humphreys & Davidson(1994),
Glatzel(2005), Owocki & Shaviv (2012), and Vink(2012)).

In a giant eruption, represented by objects like η Car in the 1840’s and P Cygni in the
1600’s, the star greatly increases its total luminosity with an increase in its visual magnitude
typically by three magnitudes or more. Giant eruptions should not be confused with the
normal LBV/S Dor variability described above. The energetics of the outburst and what we
observe are deﬁnitely diﬀerent. Unfortunately, many authors do not make the distinction
especially with respect to the SN impostors and the progenitors of Type IIn supernovae.

Few conﬁrmed LBVs are known in our galaxy due to their rarity, uncertainties in dis-
tance, and the infrequency of the LBV “eruption”. There are only six conﬁrmed LBVs in
the LMC and one in the SMC. Thus, even the Magellanic Clouds do not provide a large
enough sample to conﬁdently determine their relative numbers and group properties relative
to other massive star populations. In this paper we examine the spatial distribution of the
LBVs and candidate LBVs in M31 and M33 based on our recent discussion of the luminous
stars in those galaxies which included the discovery of a new LBV in M31 (Humphreys et al.
2013, 2014b, 2015). In the next section we show that the majority of these LBVs are found
in or near associations of young stars, and although spectra are not available for the closest
neighbors, their magnitudes and colors support the classiﬁcation of most of them as hot
supergiants.

It must be emphasized that LBVs are evolved massive stars. We should not necessarily
expect to ﬁnd them closely associated with young O stars. This is especially true for the less
luminous LBVs. The appropriate comparison population should be those supergiants found
near the quiescent temperature and luminosity of the LBVs on the HR Diagram; that is, the
evolved massive stars presumably of similar initial mass. In the Milky Way (Section 3), it is
equally important that they be at the same distance. The Smith and Tombleson Magellanic
Cloud sample was a mixed population; they combined the classical LBVs with log L/L⊙ ≥
-5.8 and the less luminous LBVs. In Section 4 we reassess their analysis separating the LBVs
into the two groups based on their positions on the HR Diagram. Their spatial distribution
and their kinematics lead to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent conclusions which are summarized in the
last section.

2. The LBVs in M31 and M33

The LBVs in M31 and M33 were originally known as the Hubble-Sandage variables.
In their paper on the ”brightest variables”, Hubble & Sandage (1953) indentiﬁed one star
in M31 (V19 = AF And) and four in M33 (Vars. A, B, C, and 2) based on their long

– 6 –

term light curves from ≈ 1920’s to 1950 2. There are now ﬁve conﬁrmed LBVs in M31:
AF And (Hubble & Sandage 1953; Humphreys 1975), AE And (Humphreys 1975), Var 15
(Hubble 1929; Humphreys 1978), Var A-1 (Rosino & Bianchini 1973; Humphreys 1978), and
the newly recognized J004526.62+415006.3 (Sholukhova et al. 2015; Humphreys et al. 2015).
The four in M33 are Variables B, C, and 2 (Hubble & Sandage 1953; Humphreys 1975) and
Var 83 (Humphreys 1978).

These stars plus a few candidate LBVs are listed in Table 1 with their luminosities and
temperature estimates for their quiescent state. LBVs have one important advantage over
other supergiants. During the LBV enhanced mass loss state, with the cool, dense wind,
the bolometric correction is near zero, allowing us to determine its bolometric luminosity
once corrected for interstellar extinction. This is the case for Var B, and Var C and for
the new LBV, J004526.62+415006.3. Other luminosities and temperatures in Table 1 are
primarily from Szeifert et al. (1996) or Humphreys et al. (2014b). The adopted corrections
for interstellar extinction are from Humphreys et al. (2014b). The LBVs and candidates are
shown on an HR Diagram in Figure 2

2Var A is now considered a post red supergiant, warm hypergiant (Humphreys et al. 1987, 2006, 2013)

Most of the known and candidate LBVs in these galaxies are in known stellar associa-
tions mapped previously by Hodge (1981) for M31 and by Humphreys & Sandage (1980) in
M33 and a few are also in or near H II regions. To compare their space distribution with
the luminous star populations in these galaxies, we show images in the Appendix of their
environments made from the Local Group Galaxy Survey (Massey et al. 2006). The LBV
and the nearby stars listed in Table 2 are identiﬁed in each image. Although spectra are
not available for these neighboring stars, their magnitudes and colors included in Table 2
indicate that most are hot stars or other supergiants. We use the Q–method to estimate the
intrinsic colors for the hot stars in Table 2.

2.1. Comments on individual stars

AE And had an LBV eruption that lasted for twenty years when it was the visually
brightest star in M31 (Luyten 1928). Recent specta show signiﬁcant variability in the
strengths of the absorption and emission lines indicating an unstable wind.
It is in the
outer parts of M31 near A170. Although there is no asociated H II region, an arc of emission
nebulosity passes through the star. The closest stars include three hot stars and one possible
red supergiant. Its luminosity places it just at the upper luminosity boundary, so it could
be a post-red supergiant (RSG).

AF And is in an association of young stars with a neighboring H II region, although

this stellar grouping was not included in the Hodge catalog.

Var A-1 is in A42 with an associated H II region. The closest star is a luminous hot

star, possibly a late O star, based on its colors.

Var 15 is a “less luminous” LBV and therefore less massive than the other LBVs in
M31. It is in A38 and just to the east of a major dust lane. The closest star is red and may
be a red supergiant. V15’s luminosity and temperature in Table 1 are estimated from its
current SED (Humphreys et al. 2014b). From 1992 to 2001 it got both fainter, by about one
magnitude in V, and bluer (Fig. 9 in (Humphreys et al. 2014b)). The color change suggests
that it has gotten hotter.

The new LBV, J004526.62 +415006.3 (M31-004526.62), is in A45 with an associated
H II region. The three closest stars are all hot stars, probable late O-type supergiants based
on their colors and luminosities.

J004051.59 +403303.0 is a candidate LBV (Massey et al. 2007; Sholukhova et al. 2015).
It is in the large association A82 in the outer SE spiral arm. The nearest stars are luminous

– 11 –

hot stars. Our spectrum from 2013 shows prominent asymmetric Balmer emission lines with
P Cyg proﬁles and Fe II emision lines with strong P Cyg absorption features. The strengths
of the Ca II H and K absorption lines and the Mg II 4481 and He I 4471 lines suggest an
early A-type supergiant. Although, it has been called an LBV or LBV candidate it could be
a warm hypergiant (Humphreys et al. 2013; Gordon et al. 2016).

J004425.18 +413452.2 is a potentially interesting star. It shows spectral variability rem-
inescent of LBVs, but its luminosity is well below the S Dor instability strip (Humphreys et al.
2014b). It is in a spiral arm between the associations A4 and A9. The nearest stars all have
intermediate colors typical of yellow supergiants consistent with this star’s lower mass and
probable post-RSG status.

Var B in M33 has been observed in a recent eruption (Szeifert et al. 1996; Massey et al.
1996), and consequently has a well-determined luminosity. It is in A142 near the center of
M33. One of the closest objects, d marked in Figure A5, may be a compact H II region based
on its point-source appearance and very bright Hα magnitude. Three additional nearby hot
stars have the colors of late O and early B-type supergiants.

Var C has been observed in several maximum light episodes (Burggraf et al. 2015) since
its initial discovery.
It entered another maximum light phase in 2013 (Humphreys et al.
2014a). A period analysis of its light curve suggests possible semi-periodic behavior of 42.4
years (Burggraf et al. 2015). Its nearest stars include three hot supergiants and a possible
RSG.

Var 83 is a luminous LBV in the prominent southern spiral arm in M33 situated between
two large associations, A101 and A103. It is surrounded by several prominent nebulous arcs,
and three of its nearest neighbors have the colors of O stars and early B-type stars.

Var 2 is near A100 and was classiﬁed Ofpe/WN9 by Neugent et al (2012). The brightest
nearby star has the colors of an A-type supergiant while three nearby faint stars have the
colors of O-type stars and are likely main sequence stars based on their luminosities.

M33-V532 = GR 290 also known as Romano’s star, has been considered an LBV or LBV
candidate by several authors. Its spectrum exhibits variability from WN8 at minimum to
WN11 at visual maximum (Sholukhova et al. 2011; Polcaro et al. 2011) with a corresponding
apparent temperature range from about 42000 K to 22000 K (Sholukhova et al. 2011). But
it is not known to show the spectroscopic transition from a hot star to the optically thick cool
wind at visual maximum that that is characteristic of the LBV/S Dor phenomenon. It may
either be in transition to the LBV stage or if it may be in a post-LBV state (Polcaro et al.
2011; Humphreys et al. 2014b). It is included here as a candidate LBV. It is in the outer
parts of M33 in A89. The nearest star has the colors of an O-type main sequence star.

– 12 –

UIT 008 is another candidate LBV (Humphreys et al. 2014b). It has the spectrum of an
Of/WN star and an unusually slow wind like the LBVs. It high temperature and luminosity
place it near the top of the S Dor instability strip. It is located in A27 and its associated H
II region NGC 588 which contains several luminous O stars and WR stars.

B526 = UIT 341 = M33C-7292 has been considered an LBV candidate (Clark et al.
2012), but it is actually two stars separated by less then 1′′. Its published spectra are all likely
composite. A recent long slit spectrum observed with the LBT/MODS (Humphreys et al.
2016) clearly separates the two stars and shows that the northeast component has an emission
line spectrum often associated with LBVs with strong H emission with P Cygni proﬁles
plus Fe II and [Fe II] emission. We therefore consider this object’s northeast component a
candidate LBV (B526NE). It is in the large A101 association with numerous nearby luminous
stars. We classify its close neighbor to the southwest as a B5 supergiant.

2.2. Spatial Distribution and Kinematics

As we have emphasized, the spatial distribution of the LBVs should be compared with
a stellar population of similar evolutionary state, with comparable luminosities and initial
masses based on their positions on the HR Diagram. All of the above luminous LBVs and
candidates with MBol & -9.8 mag, are in associations of luminous stars, some with associated
H II regions and emission nebulosity. Their nearby stars in Table 2, for the most part have
the colors of early-type stars. One might argue that by comparison AE And looks relatively
isolated. With its luminosity range, it could be a post-RSG candidate and its association
with less luminous stars would be expected. The WR variable, M33-V532 is likewise in the
outerparts of M33, but it is in an association with several early type stars.

In the Smith and Tombleson model not only have the LBVs gained mass from a com-
panion, but they have been “kicked” or moved away from their place of origin after the
supernova explosion of their more massive companion. In that case, we would expect some
of the LBVs to have high velocities compared to their expected velocity in the parent galaxy.
They would be runaway stars.

Their radial velocities are in Table 1 together with the expected velocity, in parenthe-
ses, at their positions in M31 and M33. The absorption lines in LBVs show considerable
variability due to their variable winds. We use the velocities measured from the centroid
of [Fe II] and [N II] lines to estimate their systemic velocities. These lines are formed in
the low density outer parts of the wind and are not aﬀected by P Cygni absorption. The
expected velocities were calculated following the prescription and ﬁt to the rotation curves
from Massey et al. (2009), Drout et al. (2009), and Drout et al. (2012), for the yellow and
red supergiants in M31 and M33.

Most of the LBVs have velocities within 40 km s−1 of the expected velocity based on the
rotation curve. This is consistent with and within the velocity range used by Drout et al.
(2009, 2012) to decide on membership of the yellow supergiants in M31 and M33. Thus,
none of the LBVs or candidates can be described as a runaway star.

3. The Milky Way LBVs

There are very few conﬁrmed LBVs in the Milky Way due to the infrequency of the
LBV eruption and of course to the uncertainty in the distances. Smith and Tombleson list 10
LBVs and candidate LBVs and discuss some of the better studied examples. A few deserve
some comments and cautionary remarks. As has been acknowledged for some time, the giant

– 16 –

eruption η Car is clearly associated with a population of luminous massive stars including
several O3-type stars (Davidson & Humphreys 1997). At its presumed initial mass of 150
- 200 M⊙, it is at most about 2 – 3 million years old and has not have moved far from its
place of birth.

Smith and Tombleson emphasize that most of the other Galactic LBVs are relatively
isolated from O stars. But most are also much less massive and will be older. For example,
the well-studied, classic stellar wind star, and survivor of a giant eruption, P Cygni is in
the Cyg OB1 association. At its distance, the two nearest B-type supergiants of similar
temperature and luminosity are about 30 pc away. The same is true of an O star. At its
position on the HR Diagram, P Cyg had an initial mass of ≈ 50 - 60 M⊙ and is past core H-
burning with a current mass of 23 to 30 M⊙ (Lamers et al. 1983; Pauldrach & Puls 1990). It
is therefore at least 4 - 5 × 106 years old based on the models by Ekstrom et al. (2012), with
and without rotation. With a velocity dispersion of 10 km s−1 for the extreme Population
I, P Cyg will have moved 35 - 44 pc or more. So its spatial separation from similar stars is
what would be expected.

AG Car is a well-studied classical LBV. At its high luminosity and presumed initial mass
of ≈ 80 M⊙, one would expect to ﬁnd an associated population of massive stars. Smith and
Tombleson argue that there are no nearby O stars. However, at its large kinematic distance
of ≈ 6 kpc (Humphreys et al. 1989; Groh et al. 2009), AG Car must be compared with the
stellar population at the same distance. Since our line of sight to AG Car at l = 289◦, is
directly down the Carina spiral arm, the cataloged O stars are most likely in its foreground.

HR Car is in a similar situation at ∼ 5 kpc in the Carina arm (van Genderen et al.
1991). HR Car, HD 160529, and HD 168607 are conﬁrmed LBVs, but belong to the less
luminous, less massive group of LBVs with ages of roughly 6 million years or more; enough
time for them to move 30 to 100 pc away from their original locations even at low random
speeds. We would not expect them to be closely associated with O stars.

In all cases these stars need to be compared with stars at the same distance and in the
same part of the HR diagram. That is of course the advantage of studying these stars in
nearby galaxies and especially in the Magellanic Clouds.

4. The LBVs in the Magellanic Clouds

Smith and Tombleson included nineteen stars in the Magellanic Clouds in their analysis.
However, one is a duplicate and ﬁve of the LMC stars in their list are neither LBVs nor
candidates. This does not mean that these ﬁve stars, described below, are not interesting

– 17 –

or that someday they may be shown to have LBV characteristics, but they should not be
included in a survey to set limits on the spatial distribution of the known LBVs. The six
conﬁrmed LMC LBVs (S Dor, R71, R127, R143, R110, R85) and four candidates (S61, S119,
MWC 112, Sk -69◦279) are listed in Table 3 with their observed parameters. They also list
three stars in the SMC, but R40 is the only conﬁrmed LBV/S Dor variable (Szeifert et al.
1993). The very luminous HD 5980 is a complex triple system that as we describe below
may be an example of a giant eruption, and R4, is a B[e] star. The conﬁrmed LBVs are
shown on an HR Diagram in Figure 3. The three most luminous LBVs, R127, S Dor and
R143, are the classical LBVs (Humphreys & Davidson 1994), and the remaining four belong
to the less luminous group.

MC discussed in the text.The symbols and colors are the same as in Figure 2.

4.1. The LBV Candidates in the LMC and SMC

The properties of the four candidates and the ﬁve excluded stars in the LMC plus HD
5980 and the candidate R4 in the SMC are described here with our reasoning for their
inclusion or not in our analysis. Note that MWC 112 was included twice; it is the same as

bThe parameters derived for R71 depend on the adopted foreground extinction. The analysis of its previous
S Dor maximum light by Wolf et al. (1981) used the minimum foreground value of 0.15 mag for the LMC.
Here we use adopt AV of 0.37 mag, see Mehner et al. (2013), which yields an MBol of -9.2 mag for its 1970-77
eruption. During its current large eruption, R71 has actually increased in luminosity.

Sk -69◦142a.

S61 (= Sk -67◦266) was classiﬁed O8Iafpe by Bohannan & Walborn (1989) but later
revised to WN11h by Crowther & Smith (1997). No S Dor type variability has been ob-
served and its wind speed of 900 km s−1 (Wolf et al. 1987) is much higher than observed
for conﬁrmed LBVs in quiescence (Humphreys et al. 2014b), although Crowther & Smith
(1997) derive a terminal velocity of 250 km s−1. S61 has an expanding circumstellar nebula
(Weis 2003b) similar to the nebulae associated with some LBVs. Primarily for that reason
it is included as an LBV candidate.

S119 (= HDE 269687) is an Ofpe/WN9 star (Bohannan & Walborn 1989) or WN11h
(Crowther & Smith 1997) with the low wind velocity, 230 km s−1 typical of LBVs in quies-
cence, and an expanding circumstellar nebula (Weis et al. 2003a). But Weis et al. (2003a)
also ﬁnd that the center of the expansion has a velocity of 156 km s−1, rather low for mem-
bership in the LMC. The possibility that S119 may be a runaway is discussed later. It has
not been observed to show S Dor type variability, and is included here as a candidate LBV.

MWC 112 (= HDE 269582 = Sk -69◦142a) is another late WN star (WN10h, Crowther & Smith

(1997)), a class of stars associated with some LBVs in quiescence. It is a known variable
with small light variations on the order of ± 0.2 mag (van Genderen & Sterken 1996), but
does not have a circumstellar nebula.

Sk -69◦279 is classiﬁed as an O9f star (Conti et al. 1986) with a large associated cir-
cumstellar nebula (Weis et al. 1995, 1997; Weis & Duschl 2002). It is on that basis that we
consider it a candidate LBV.

LMC Non-LBV candidates:

R81 (= HDE 269128 = Hen S86) was initially considered an example of S Dor variability
(Wolf et al. 1981), but it was soon shown to be an eclipsing binary (Stahl et al. 1987). This
analysis and conclusion is conﬁrmed in the more recent paper by Tubbesing et al. (2002).
For this reason it was not included in the review by Humphreys & Davidson (1994). R81’s
spectroscopic and photometric variability are tied to its orbital motion. It is not an LBV or
a candidate.

R126 (= HD 37974) is a B[e]sg star (Lamers et al. 1998; Zickgraf et al. 1985) similar to

the classic S18, and has not been considered an LBV or candidate LBV in the literature.

R84 (= HDE 269227) has a composite spectrum with an early-type supergiant plus an M
supergiant (Munari et al. 2009). It has been suggested to be a dormant LBV (Crowther et al.
1995), but the various conﬂicting descriptions of this star which have included reports of TiO
bands, are now attributed to its composite nature (B0 Ia + M4 Ia, Stahl et al. (1984)). If

– 20 –

this is a physical pair it is an important star since so few M supergiants are known binaries.

Sk -69◦271 (= CPD -69◦5001) has been classiﬁed as a B4 I/III star (Neugent & Massey
2011). It is associated with an arc of Hα emission (Weis et al. 1997) and is considered to
be a possible X-ray binary (Sasaki et al. 2000). It has not been suggested to be an LBV
or candidate in the literature.
Its luminosity, based on its spectral type and extinction
(Neugent & Massey 2011), of MBol ≈ -7.90 mag, places it below the LBV/S Dor instability
strip.

R99 (= HDE 269445) can best be described as peculiar. It is classiﬁed as an Ofpe/WN9
star (Bohannan & Walborn 1989). Although it shows spectral and photometric variability,
the amplitude is very small. Crowther & Smith (1997) emphasize its peculiar spectrum
and variability. Its high wind velocity of 1000 km s−1 argues against an LBV in quiesence.
Although it is associated with emission from a nearby H II region, Weis (2003b) concludes
that there is no circumstellar nebula like those associated with some LBVs and candidates.

LBV candidates in the SMC

HD 5980 is a complex triple system with two luminous hot stars in a short period
eclipsing binary (PAB = 19.3d). Star B is considered to be an early-type WN star, and
the third star(C) is an O-type supergiant which may also be a binary (Koenigsberger et al.
2014). In 1994, HD 5980 experienced a brief 3.5 mag brightening that lasted about 5 months.
At maximum, the absorption line spectrum was described as B1.5Ia+ (Koenigsberger et al.
1996), but Moﬀat et al. (1998) later classiﬁed it as WN11. It did not produce the LBV/S
Dor cool wind at maximum.
In that respect it is reminiscent of M33-V532. Given its
brightening and short duration however, HD 5980 can be better described as a giant eruption.
Nevertheless numerous authors describe it as an LBV. For that reason we include it in Table
3, but with the above caveat.

R4 is a spectroscopic binary (Zickgraf et al. 1996) with an early B-type supergiant plus
an early A-type supegiant. The hot star is described as a B[e] star with Tef f of 27,000◦and
MBol = -7.7 mag which places it below and well outside the S Dor instability strip. Its LBV
nature has not been established, and subsequent papers treat it as a B[e] star.

4.2. The Spatial Distribution and Kinematics of the Magellanic Cloud LBVs

Here we reassess the Smith and Tombleson analysis of spatial correlations in the LMC
and SMC. For each star in a set, e.g. WN stars, red supergiants, or LBVs, the projected
distance DO to the nearest O-type star is measured and the cumulative fraction of the stars

– 21 –

in that set that have DO less than a given value is then plotted. This is illustrated in Figure
4 where we reproduce their Magellanic LBV sample from their Table 1 together with the
late-type O stars, WN stars and red supergiants. The O-type stars, for example, tend to
exist in groups so naturally they have small values of DO. We would conclude from this
ﬁgure that the red supergiants have a spatial distribution uncorrelated with O stars. The
stars in the Smith and Tombleson sample fall in between.

Fig. 4.— The cumulative fraction versus the projected distance to the nearest O -type star
for the Magellanic Cloud LBV sample from Smith & Tombleson (2015) based on their ﬁgure.
The distributions for the late O-type stars, WN stars, and red supergiants are shown for
reference.

We repeat this analysis for the stars in Table 3. The duplicate entry is removed as are
the six stars (§4.1) that have no clear relation to LBVs. There are seven conﬁrmed LBVs plus
four “candidates”. We replot the cumulative distributions for the classical and less luminous
LBVs in Figure 5. The three classical LBVs are the most luminous in the sample, and
were originally identiﬁed as classical LBVs in Humphreys & Davidson (1994). They have an
average DO of only 7 pc, and as Figure 5 shows their distribution is indistinguishable from

– 22 –

the late O-type stars, so far as small-number statistics allow. The less luminous LBVs, on
the other hand, parallel the RSG distribution (and their avoidance of O stars) as we would
expect for these less luminous, less massive and highly evolved stars. One can even assign a
statistical signiﬁcance to this result, as follows. Among the 7 conﬁrmed LBVs in the total
set, the 3 brightest have the smallest values of DO; the ab initio probability of this outcome
would be 2.9% if all seven represent the same population.

Fig. 5.— The cumulative fraction versus the projected distance to the nearest O -type star
for the classical LBVs (LBV1) and less luminous LBVs (LBV 2) in the Magellanic Clouds.

Just as important, their velocities do not suggest that any of the LBVs are runaways
or have exceptionally high velocities. Their heliocentric velocities are included in Table 3
with the references. The emission line velocities are given for the RAVE measurements
(Munari et al. 2009) except for R1433. The published average velocities for the Magellanic
Clouds range from 262 - 278 km s−1 for the LMC and from 146 - 160 km s−1 for the SMC
(Richter et al. 1987; McConnachie 2012). The LBV velocities are all consistent with their

– 23 –

membership, and for the LMC stars, with their position based on the H I rotation curve
available at NED (from Kim et al. (1998)). The only exception is the candidate LBV, S119
with a possible systemic velocity based on the center of its expanding nebula (Weis et al.
2003a) that is much lower than expected at its position in the LMC. Thus S119 is a candidate
for a runaway star.

In addition, a runaway star with a high velocity would be expected to alter the morphol-
ogy of its cicumstellar ejecta, the LBV nebula. Runaway stars are commonly known to have
an arc-like bow shock nebula due to interaction with the interstellar medium (Brown & Bomans
2005). The stars in M31 and M33 are too distant to search for bow shocks, but several
conﬁrmed LBVs and candidates in the Milky Way and LMC have associated circumstellar
nebulae that are either spherical of bipolar in shape (Weis 2011). They are not bow shocks.
The only nebula that has a signature, an embedded arc in the surrounding nebulosity, that
could be attributed to a bow shock is S119 which may be a runaway.

The distribution of the four LBV candidates in the LMC in Figure 6 interestingly follows
that of the less luminous LBVs. Three of the four are considered candidates because of their
circumstellar nebulae. The origin of their very extended ejecta may be a prior giant eruption
or numerous earlier S Dor-like events, but their low expansion velocities (14–27 km s−1) are
a puzzle compared with the outﬂow velocities of LBV winds and giant eruptions 4. They
may be due to deceleration with the ISM or the product of mass loss in a previous state
with lower ejection velocities. Their published luminosities are very similar and except for
Sk -69◦279, they lie in or near the LBV instability strip. Based on their position on the
HR Diagram, they may be post-RSGs or given their rather high luminosities, former warm
hypergiants like IRC +10420 or Var A in M33.

5. Concluding Remarks

In M31 and M33 we conclude that except possibly for AE And which may be a post-
RSG, the LBVs and candidates are associated with luminous young stars and supergiants
appropriate to their luminosities and positions on the HR diagram. Their measured velocities
are also consistent with their positions in their respective galaxies. There no evidence that
they are runaway stars that have moved away from their place of origin.

In the Magellanic Clouds, separating the LBVs by luminosity removes the apparent
isolation of the LBVs claimed by Smith and Tombleson. The more luminous and more

4The nebulae associated with Milky Way LBVs have expansion velocities of 50 - 75 km s−1.

massive, classical LBVs have a distribution similar to the late-type O stars and the WN
stars, while the less luminous ones have a distribution like the RSGs, an evolved lower mass
population of supergiants. In both the Magellanic Clouds and in M31 and M33, none of the
sample of 16 conﬁrmed LBVs have high velocities or are candidate runaway stars.

One positive result is especially notable: since the LBV distribution in Figure 5 is
indistinguishable from the red supergiants, evidently the less luminous LBVs are not young.
This fact strongly supports the interpretation outlined in Section 1, i.e., those objects have
evolved back to the blue in the HR Diagram.

It is not necessary to invoke an exotic explanation such as “kicked mass gainers” from
binary systems to explain the Luminous Blue Variables. Some LBVs and candidates are
indeed binaries (Rivinius, et al. 2015; Martayan et al. 2016), but this binarity contradicts
the Smith and Tombleson scenario of the LBV, the primary in these systems, as the mass
gainer. Furthermore, in two cases (Martayan et al. 2016), the secondary is thousands of AU

– 25 –

away and cannot be the cause of the LBV’s instability. Thus the results of our discussion
and analysis supports the accepted description of LBVs of all luminosities as evolved massive
stars that have shed a lot of mass, whether as hot stars or as red supergiants, and are now
close to their Eddington limit.

Research by R. Humphreys, K. Davidson, and M. Gordon on massive stars is supported

by the National Science Foundation AST-1109394.

A. The LBV Environments in M31 and M33

The blue and Hα images of the LBVs and candidate LBVs are made from the Local

Group Galaxy Survey (Massey et al. 2006).
