ABSTRACT

Context. A recent discovery of two stellar clusters associated with the diﬀuse high-latitude cloud HRK 81.4–77.8 has important
implications for star formation in the Galactic halo.
Aims. We derive a plausible distance estimate to HRK 81.4-77.8 primarily from its gaseous properties.
Methods. We spatially correlate state-of-the-art HI, far-infrared and soft X-ray data to analyze the diﬀuse gas in the cloud. The
absorption of the soft X-ray emission from the Galactic halo by HRK 81.4-77.8 is used to constrain the distance to the cloud.
Results. HRK 81.4-77.8 is most likely located at an altitude of about 400 pc within the disk-halo interface of the Milky Way Galaxy.
The HI data discloses a disbalance in density and pressure between the warm and cold gaseous phases. Apparently, the cold gas is
compressed by the warm medium. This disbalance might trigger the formation of molecular gas high above the Galactic plane on pc
to sub-pc scales.

1. Introduction

Camargo et al. (2015) report on the discovery of two embed-
ded stellar clusters proposed to be physically associated with
the high Galactic latitude cloud HRK 81.4-77.8 (or Heiles et al.
1988, G 81.4-77.8). Using WISE data (Wright et al. 2010)
Camargo et al. (2015) deduce from their color-magnitude dia-
grams (CMDs) an age of about 2 Myr for both stellar clusters,
Camargo 438 and Camargo 439. Based on the absolute stellar
luminosity, a distance from the Sun of about 5 kpc is calculated.
Because of their location close to the southern Galactic pole they
are positioned nearly at the solar circle, but at an altitude of about
4 kpc below the Galactic plane. Moreover, Camargo et al. (2015)
identiﬁed two cluster member stars with known proper motions
towards Camargo 439. This information is used to estimate the
orbital parameters of the extra-planar clusters.

Our aim is to explore the physical conditions and the inter-
stellar gas properties of HRK 81.4-77.8. So far only two high
Galactic latitude clouds that form stars at altitudes of a few tens
of pc above the Galactic plane, namely MBM 12 and MBM 20
(Magnani et al. 1985), have been identiﬁed (see McGehee 2008).
Both star-forming MBM clouds are classiﬁed as dark interstellar
clouds. Dark interstellar clouds show up with an optical extinc-
tion in excess of AV = 5 mag (McGehee 2008).

We use state-of-the-art multifrequency data for our inves-
tigation. The HI 21 cm line data of the Parkes Galactic All–
Sky Survey (GASS) (Kalberla & Haud 2015; Kalberla et al.
2010; McClure-Griﬃths et al. 2009) and the Planck far-infrared
(FIR) data (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014) are analyzed
to quantify the amount of molecular gas in HRK 81.4-
77.8. The interstellar extinction is evaluated by the updated
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011) Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis
(SFD) data set (Schlegel et al. 1998). ROSAT all–sky survey
data (Snowden & Schmitt 1990; Snowden et al. 1997) are ana-
lyzed to evaluate the soft X-ray shadow of HRK 81.4-77.8 allow-

ing to estimate its distance from the Sun. Section 2 comprises the
details of our analyses, while Sect. 3 contains our conclusions.

2011)

Using the improved SFD data set
(Schlegel et al. 1998;
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner
interstellar
extinction
HRK 81.4-77.8 reveals a maximum of only AV = 0.144 mag.
According to this value it has to be classiﬁed as a diﬀuse cloud
(McGehee 2008). Diﬀuse interstellar clouds are not expected to
eﬃciently shield molecules against dissociation by high-energy
photons, even within their densest portions. Thus, signiﬁcant
fractions of molecular gas are not expected to be present under
these environmental conditions (Kennicutt & Evans 2012).
Hence, the physical association of the stellar clusters Camargo
438 and 439 with HRK 81.4-77.8 is a striking proposal.

2.2. HRK81.4-77.8:Distanceestimatederivedfrom

interstellarreddening

Very recently Green et al. (2015) published a 3-D database of
interstellar dust reddening based on optical and near-infrared
surveys. Inspecting this data cube for the extinction towards
HRK 81.4–77.8 discloses a faint signal. The best ﬁt extinction
shows a continuous increase in the reddening up to a distance
of 400 pc. Beyond that distance the reddening remains constant
out to 15 kpc. When HRK 81.4–77.8 is located at a distance of
5 kpc we would expect a second increase in the reddening at
this particular distance, which is not observed. Accordingly, the
Green et al. (2015) database is not consistent with a location of
HRK 81.4–77.8 at 5 kpc.

2.3. EstimatingthedistancetoHRK81.4-77.8:ROSAT

All-SkySurveydata

Soft X-rays with photon energies below the carbon edge of
0.284 keV are very sensitive to photoelectric absorption by the
interstellar gas (Wilms et al. 2000).

The eﬀective photoelectric absorption cross section at a
column density of approximately NHI = 3.0 · 1020 cm−2 is
σ ≃ 0.8 · 10−20 cm2 for a thermal plasma of T = 106.2 K (see
Snowden et al. 1994, Fig. 4). Thus, even diﬀuse interstellar gas
at high galactic latitude modulates the soft X-ray background in-
tensity distribution signiﬁcantly.

Prior to the ROSAT mission (Snowden & Schmitt 1990;
Snowden et al. 1997) it was thought that the observed soft X-ray
background emission originates entirely from a thermal plasma
(Snowden et al. 1990) ﬁlling the local cavity (Frisch & York
1983; Paresce 1984; Lallement et al. 2014). In consequence,
soft X-ray brightness variations are solely due to diﬀerent
path lengths through the coronal plasma, sampling essen-
tially the shape of the local bubble (Snowden et al. 1990;
McCammon & Sanders 1990).

The discovery of a soft X-ray shadow of the high galactic
altitude Draco cloud (Snowden et al. 1991) led to a revision of
the local hot bubble model. Moreover, Pietz et al. (1998) demon-
strated that the soft X-ray background intensity distribution can
be modeled quantitatively across the full sky adopting a simpli-
ﬁed soft X-ray radiation transfer:

I = Ilocal + Idistant · e−σ·NHI .

(1)

In addition to the local soft X-ray thermal emission, Ilocal a much
more luminous and slightly hotter thermal plasma component
Idistant ﬁlls a ﬂattened Milky Way halo (scale heights 4.4 kpc,
scale length 15 kpc; Pietz et al. (1998)). This distant soft X-ray
emission originates beyond the bulk of the neutral hydrogen (see
Kalberla & Kerp 2009, Fig. 11). Consequently, Snowden et al.
(2000) released a catalog of 378 soft X-ray shadows associated
with individual HI clouds.

Their Table 1 contains as shadow #100 a four degree ex-
tended soft X-ray absorption feature positionally coincident with
HRK 81.4-77.8. In Fig. 1 we show the NHI map of HRK 81.4-
77.8 (left-hand panel) and a slice across the whole cloud (right-
hand panel). The ROSAT R12 count rates and the HI col-
umn density disclose a positional negative correlation. Accord-
ingly, HRK 81.4-77.8 is physically coincident with the soft X-
ray shadow #100 of Snowden et al. (2000). The maximum HI

Article number, page 2 of 6

column density of HRK 81.4-77.8 along that slice is NHI ≃
2.5 · 1020 cm−2. Calculating the product of NHI and the eﬀec-
tive soft X-ray absorption cross section yields σ · NHI = 1.8
for the ROSAT R12 band. An attenuation of about 83% of all
soft X-ray emission originating beyond HRK 81.4-77.8 is ex-
pected (see Eq.1). In summary, towards the high column den-
sity portion of the cloud we observe dominantly Ilocal, while the
soft X-ray shadow detection conﬁrms by itself a localization of
the cloud in front of the bulk of the Milky Way halo plasma.
Pietz et al. (1998) determined that the scale height of the Milky
Way X-ray halo is about 4.4 kpc. Adopting a distance of 500 pc
about 50% of the halo plasma is located beyond HRK 81.4-77.8.
Thus, the ROSAT soft X-ray shadow implies a nearby location
of HRK 81.4-77.8 because of its signiﬁcant depth. However, an
upper distance limit of 500 pc is compatible with the cloud’s ab-
sorption feature within the uncertainties of the X-ray data.

Towards the deepest portions of the soft X-ray shadow of
HRK 81.4-77.8 we observe dominantly Ilocal. This foreground
emission is a measure for the minimum separation between
the cloud and the Sun. Snowden et al. (2000) determined an
Ilocal count rate of only (3.7 ± 0.4) · 10−4 cts s−1 arcmin−2 in
the ROSAT R12 energy band. This is quantitatively equal to
the Ilocal count rate observed towards MBM 12 (Snowden et al.
1993) with (3.7 ± 0.4) · 10−4 cts s−1 arcmin−2. However, MBM12
is located at a distance of (360 ± 30) pc (Andersson et al. 2002).
Because of systematic uncertainties in determining the ab-
solute quantity of Ilocal (Galeazzi et al. 2014; Puspitarini et al.
2014) we explore the error–range of this distance estimate. For
this aim we inspect the local count rate towards
– the Draco cloud (Snowden et al. (2000) shadow #116, Ilocal =
(4.8±0.2)·10−4 cts s−1 arcmin−2 at a distance between 463 pc
and 618 pc Gladders et al. (1998)) and

– IVC 135+54

(Snowden et al.

shadow #182,
Ilocal = (5.8 ± 0.2) · 10−4 cts s−1 arcmin−2 at (395 ± 95) pc
Benjamin et al. (1996)).

(2000)

Both Ilocal count rates are in excess of that observed towards
HRK 81.4-77.8. Implying that HRK 81.4-77.8 is most likely
located in between MBM 12 and both IVCs within a dis-
tance bracket of 300 pc to 500 pc. While the lower distance
limit is aﬀected by systematic uncertainties in evaluating Ilocal
(Galeazzi et al. 2014), the depth of the strong soft X-ray shadow
sets a robust upper distance limit, which is of greater importance
here for our discussion. Adopting this distance bracket we have
to consider HRK 81.4-77.8 as a low-extinction, diﬀuse interstel-
lar cloud located within the Milky Way’s disk-halo interface.

resolution of 14.4′

The maximum HI column density of HRK 81.4-77.8
at GASS angular
is NHI = 3.9 ·
1020 cm−2. This neutral hydrogen column density exceeds the
molecule formation threshold value of NHI = 2.0 · 1020 cm−2
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2011). Above that value the FIR
emissivity cannot be approximated by NHI alone; additionally,
we have to account for molecular hydrogen NH2 because IFIR ∝
NH = NHI + 2 · NH2. Associated with HRK 81.4-77.8 we expect
the presence of a detectable amount of molecular hydrogen from
the FIR.

Correlating the Planck FIR 857 GHz and the GASS HI data
allows us to evaluate the gas–to–dust ratio and the amount of
NH2. Molecular gas, not quantitatively traced by neutral hydro-
gen, can be identiﬁed by an excess over the linear FIR-to-NHI
correlation. Figure 2 shows the 857 GHz FIR emission versus the
HI column density. For the quantitative evaluation we smooth the
Planck data to the lower angular resolution of GASS. The linear
portion of the HI/FIR correlation is evaluated by

IFIR = ǫ · NHI + Z.

(3)

For the dust emissivity we ﬁnd ǫ = (0.31 ± 0.01) · 10−20 MJy sr−1
and Z = (0.47 ± 0.02) MJy sr−1. The slope is compatible to the
mean Galactic value between ǫ = 0.3 − 0.7 · 10−20 MJy sr−1 cm2
(Boulanger et al. 1996; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011). This
too is a strong argument for a nearby location of HRK 81.4-77.8,
in addition to the ROSAT soft X-ray shadow. HRK 81.4-77.8 ap-
pears to be exposed to the same radiation ﬁeld as a typical local
Galactic interstellar cloud.

2.6. MoleculargasfractionofHRK81.4-77.8

Although CO has not yet been observed in HRK 81.4-77.8, CO-
dark molecular hydrogen may be present. Figure 2 shows that
above NHI = 2.0 · 1020 cm−2 the linear relation between dust
and gas does not match quantitatively. Excess FIR emission
is commonly attributed to the presence of molecular hydrogen
NH2 (Reach et al. 1998). An upper limit for NH2 can be deter-
mined by attributing all FIR excess emission to NH2. At a res-
olution of 14.4 arcmin we derive a peak column density for H2
of NH2 = 2.8 · 1020 cm−2 from the FIR/HI correlation shown in
Fig. 2. We chose for this scatter diagram a circular aperture cen-
tered at the HI peak with a radius of 2.7 degrees. Consequently
HRK 81.4-77.8 is dominantly an atomic cloud with a signiﬁcant
fraction of molecular gas. Locally a molecular fraction of up to
2·NH2
f = 60% (cid:18) f =
NHI+2·NH2 (cid:19) is deduced. These regions are position-
ally coincident with cold neutral medium (CNM) gas.

To estimate the volume-ﬁlling factor of the molecular gas
in HRK 81.4-77.8, which are below the angular resolution level
of the Parkes telescope, we evaluate the FIR intensity contrast
between the individual FIR peaks and their neighborhood at
Planck’s full angular resolution of 4.3 arcmin at 857 GHz. On
these angular scales, corresponding to physical sizes of about
0.5 pc (at 400 pc altitude), a variation in FIR brightness of up to
a factor of two can be determined. This suggests, that the vol-
ume density is not expected to increase by more than an order of
magnitude between linear scales of 0.5 pc and 1.6 pc (Parkes res-
olution). All gaseous properties of HRK 81.4-77.8 are consistent
with normal high galactic latitude clouds. Moreover, the signif-
icant fraction of molecular gas can be considered typical for an
infrared cirrus object (Gillmon & Shull 2006).

Fig. 2. NHI versus IFIR 857 GHz correlation plot. The solid line rep-
resents a linear approximation (see Eq. 3) to the data. Above NHI =
2.5 · 1020 cm−2 FIR excess emission is observed. This emission is at-
tributed to the presence of additional molecular hydrogen regions not
traced by NHI.

Thus, our result is in conﬂict with the 5 kpc distance estimate
of Camargo et al. (2015). Consequently, the stars of both stellar
clusters might be signiﬁcantly fainter and of much lower mass
than initially assumed.

2.4. EstimatingthedistancetoHRK81.4-77.8:Proper

motioninformationtowardsCamargo439

Associated with the stellar cluster Camargo 439 are two proper
motion measurements; the absolute length of the proper mo-
tion vectors are both about 6.2 marcsec/year (see Camargo et al.
2015, Tab. 2). This proper motion corresponds to
6.2 · 10−3 arcsec year−1 ≡ 29.3 km s−1 kpc−1

(2)

≃ 147 km s−1 at a distance of 5 kpc, as
yielding v⊥
Camargo et al. (2015) assume. These very high tangential ve-
locities are unexpected for young stellar clusters (Foster et al.
2015), suggesting that Camargo 439 needs to be extremely
young to be detected as an entity because the two stellar
proper motion vectors are oriented almost perpendicular to
each other. Camargo et al. (2015) estimated an age of 2 ±
1 Myr for Camargo 439 which appears to be incompatible with
the high proper motion. Moving for a period of 1 Myr with
6 marcsec year−1 would displace the stars by more than a de-
gree from their birthplace. These numbers are inconsistent with
the apparent overdensity of the stellar members of Camargo 439
(see Camargo et al. 2015, Fig. 2 left).

Adopting the hypothesis that Camargo 439 is physically as-
sociated with HRK 81.4-77.8 and consequently located at an up-
per distance limit of 400 pc yields v⊥ ≃ 11.7 km s−1. Even this
value is in some conﬂict with actual studies of the stellar velocity
dispersion of a young stellar cluster (Foster et al. 2015), but of
the same order of magnitude as the turbulence broadened HI line
width of the warm gas component of HRK 81.4-77.8 (Fig. 3).

2.5. FIRemissionofHRK81.4-77.8

Heiles et al. (1988) investigated the FIR, HI, and carbon monox-
ide (CO) properties of 26 isolated, degree-sized interstellar
clouds. In the case of HRK 81.4-77.8 they did not report on CO
(see Heiles et al. 1988, Tab. 2). Magnani et al. (2000) performed
a southern hemisphere survey of the 12CO(1 → 0) transition.
Their survey also does not comprise any information on the CO
content of HRK 81.4-77.8 (see Magnani et al. 2000, Fig. 1).

2.7.2. Ram pressure

Figure 4 shows the dynamics of the HI gas. Displayed are six
brightness temperature maps of subsequent spectral channels.
Starting at vLSR = −12.78 km s−1 it is possible to see that even
beyond the FIR emission of HRK 81.4-77.8 dynamically related
HI emission is observed. We note that the displayed Doppler ve-
locity panels sample the narrow (CNM) portion of the HI spec-
tral line of HRK 81.4–77.8 (Fig. 3). The whole ﬁeld of interest is
ﬁlled with HI gas moving at comparable Doppler velocities and
sharing similar properties with respect to spectral line width and
brightness temperature to HRK 81.4-77.8. A remarkable rapid
structural variation of the HI brightness temperature from chan-
nel to channel is obvious. With decreasing Doppler velocity we
can identify a ring like structure in the middle and bottom panels
of Fig. 4. It encircles the FIR emission of HRK 81.4-77.8.

Across the extent of the FIR emission of HRK 81.4-77.8,
Fig. 4 discloses a Doppler velocity gradient of at least 6.4 km s−1.
This Doppler velocity gradient will cross the whole cloud within
a few 105 years.

3. Discussion and conclusions

In this paper we determine an upper distance limit
for
HRK 81.4–77.8. This is an important piece of information con-
sidering the challenging proposal of Camargo et al. (2015) that
the densest portions of this clouds are associated with star for-
mation at an altitude of about 5 kpc above the Galactic plane.
The low extinction, the FIR emissivity, the implausible tangen-
tial velocities, and the soft X-ray shadow consistently argue
for a location of HRK 81.4–77.8 at an altitude of between 300
and 500 pc. Its Doppler velocity classiﬁes HRK 81.4–77.8 as a
low-velocity cloud with a two-phase medium. HRK 81.4–77.8 is
continuously connected to neighboring HI gas showing up with
comparable radial velocities and HI emission properties. In all
aspects HRK 81.4–77.8 is a normal high galactic altitude cloud
hosting some molecular regions. These molecular regions are of
about 0.5 pc extent and show up with a total hydrogen mass of
nH = nHI+2·nH2 of MH ≃ 10 M⊙. The association with the young
stellar clusters is unexpected (Camargo et al. 2015). Special in
addition to HRK 81.4–77.8 is however the large scale radial ve-
locity gradient, perhaps tracing a volume density/gas pressure
situation out of any equilibrium between the WNM and CNM.
This implies that the cloud might be in a transient state and not
in an equilibrium state.

Figure 4 is suggestive for a ram–pressure interaction between
the gas associated with HRK 81.4-77.8 and the disk–halo inter-
face gas layers. This ram pressure might provide the necessary
additional energy to trigger a WNM to CNM transition similar to
the situation described by Röhser et al. (2014) and Röhser et al.
(2015, submitted). Eventually, this will lead to the formation of
molecular hydrogen even towards low column density clouds in
the disk-halo interface, as reported by Gillmon & Shull (2006);
PlanckXXV (2011).

At the altitude of the disk–halo interface (about 400 pc;
(Kalberla & Kerp 2009), the Galactic radiation ﬁeld is suﬃ-
ciently thinned out (Haﬀner et al. 2009). Hence, the probability
of detecting a signiﬁcant fraction of molecular gas towards low
column density diﬀuse clouds is high. That this is indeed the
case, even in low-extinction diﬀuse interstellar clouds, is obser-
vationally conﬁrmed by multiple observations via HI/FIR corre-
lations and CO emission maps (Moritz et al. 1998; Weiß et al.
1999; Heithausen et al. 2001; Röhser et al. 2014; Lenz et al.
2015). This holds true also on linear scales below one pc. Here,

Camargo 439 (solid line). Next to the bright narrow HI line a underlying
broad HI emission line is visible. Oﬀset from that position we extracted
an HI spectrum of the unrelated HI emission (dashed line).

2.7. HIpropertiesofHRK81.4-77.8

Its extinction classiﬁes HRK 81.4-77.8 as a diﬀuse cloud. It is
host to a signiﬁcant fraction of molecular gas of up to 60% of the
total hydrogen column density. Most likely it is located within
the disk–halo interface of the Milky Way Galaxy. A few high
galactic latitude clouds at these altitudes have been studied so
far, but disclosing very similar physical properties (Moritz et al.
1998; Weiß et al. 1999; Heithausen et al. 2001; Hernandez et al.
2013; Röhser et al. 2014; Lenz et al. 2015). The most signiﬁcant
diﬀerence is, however, the association of HRK 81.4-77.8 with
two stellar clusters. If this association is a real one and not an
accidental, this would have major implications for the formation
of dwarf stars and brown dwarfs.

2.7.1. Density perturbation in the warm neutral medium

Figure 3 shows the HI spectrum towards Camargo 438 averaged
across an area of a single GASS beam. It discloses a two-
component HI spectrum. The peak brightness temperature is
about TB = 17.7 K and the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
is only ∆vnarrow(FWHM) = 4.9 km s−1. This narrow line width
corresponds to an upper limit for the kinetic temperature of
Tkin = 550 K. In such a cold cloud the velocity of sound is only
cS = 2.7 km s−1.

The HI line proﬁle displays a second HI line component
that is dimmer but broader. Approximating simultaneously two
Gaussian proﬁles to this HI spectrum yields almost the same
Doppler velocity of the CNM vnarrow = −6.9 ± 0.1 km s−1 and
a warm vbroad = −7.2 ± 0.1 km s−1 component. The line width
of the warm neutral medium (WNM) is ∆vbroad(FWHM) =
22 km s−1. The column density of the broad component is
NHI(WNM) = 1.8 · 1020 cm−2 and about 30% higher than for
the narrow line component (NHI(CNM) = 1.3 · 1020 cm−2).

Oﬀset from HRK 81.4-77.8 we extracted an HI spectrum of
the unrelated environmental HI gas. It is shown in Fig. 3 by the
dashed line. This oﬀ–cloud HI spectrum ﬁts the second broad
HI component towards Camargo 438 nicely. This ﬁnding implies
that the warm HI gas component ON Camargo 438 is the same
as OFF to HRK 81.4-77.8.

Accordingly, we cannot attribute the whole WNM gas com-
ponent observed towards Camargo 438 to HRK 81.4-77.8, but to
the WNM gas layer of the Milky Way Galaxy. The similarity
of the radial velocities of HRK 81.4-77.8 and the WNM argues,
however, for a common origin of both. HRK 81.4-77.8 might be
the result of a distortion in the velocity ﬁeld (ram pressure) of
the WNM initiating the molecular gas formation.

molecular structures have been observed as a common phe-
nomenon towards the high Galactic latitude sky as reported by
Heithausen (2007) and Gillmon & Shull (2006).

When stars are really formed at high galactic altitudes, they
will chemically and dynamically resemble their gaseous nurs-
ery. Smooth gradients in the chemical composition of dwarf halo
stars and in their angular momentum distribution should be ob-
served (Fuhrmann 1998; Nidever et al. 2014), but ﬁrst and fore-
most we need to study the stellar population of Camargo 438 and
439 in much more detail.

Fig. 4. HI 21-cm brightness temperature maps of six subsequent velocity channels. HRK 81.4-77.8 is located in the very center of the map. Note,
that bright HI emission is detected across the whole ﬁeld of interest, comparable in both, the brightness as well as in line width. HRK 81.4-77.8 is
hence part of a much larger extended HI structure. Remarkable is the gas motion from top-left to HRK 81.4-77.8 in the very center in hand with
the formation of a ring-like structure encircling HRK 81.4-77.8.
