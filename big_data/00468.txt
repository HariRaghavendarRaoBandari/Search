ABSTRACT
We analyse the sizes, colour gradients, and resolved stellar mass distributions for 36 massive
and passive galaxies in the cluster XMMUJ2235-2557 at z = 1.39 using optical and near-
infrared Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We derive light-weighted Sérsic ﬁts in ﬁve HST
bands (i775,z850,Y105,J125,H160), and ﬁnd that the size decreases by ∼ 20% going from i775
to H160 band, consistent with recent studies. We then generate spatially resolved stellar mass
maps using an empirical relationship between M∗/LH160 and (z850 − H160) and use these to
derive mass-weighted Sérsic ﬁts: the mass-weighted sizes are ∼ 41% smaller than their rest-
frame r-band counterparts compared with an average of ∼ 12% at z ∼ 0. We attribute this
evolution to the evolution in the M∗/LH160 and colour gradient. Indeed, as expected, the ratio
of mass-weighted to light-weighted size is correlated with the M∗/L gradient, but is also
mildly correlated with the mass surface density and mass-weighted size. The colour gradients
(∇z−H ) are mostly negative, with a median value of ∼ 0.45 mag dex−1, twice the local value.
The evolution is caused by an evolution in age gradients along the semi-major axis (a), with
∇age = d log(age)/d log(a) ∼ −0.33, while the survival of weaker colour gradients in old,
local galaxies implies that metallicity gradients are also required, with ∇Z = d log(Z)/d log(a)
∼ −0.2. This is consistent with recent observational evidence for the inside-out growth of
passive galaxies at high redshift, and favours a gradual mass growth mechanism, such as
minor mergers.

INTRODUCTION

The study of galaxy clusters at high redshift has attracted a lot of
attention over the last decade, as these large structures provide a
unique environment for understanding the formation and evolution
of massive galaxies we see in the present day Universe. Massive
galaxies in clusters especially in the cluster cores are preferentially
in the red passive population, have regular early-type morphology
and are mainly composed of old stars (e.g. Dressler 1980; Rosati
et al. 2009; Mei et al. 2009). Nevertheless, in higher redshift clus-
ters (z (cid:38) 1.5) a substantial massive population are recently found

to be still actively forming stars (e.g. Hayashi et al. 2011; Gobat
et al. 2013; Strazzullo et al. 2013; Bayliss et al. 2014). The mem-
ber passive galaxies reside on a well-deﬁned sequence in colour-
magnitude space, namely the red sequence which is seen in clusters
up to redshift z ∼ 2 (e.g. Kodama & Arimoto 1997; Stanford, Eisen-
hardt & Dickinson 1998; Gobat et al. 2011; Tanaka et al. 2013;
Andreon et al. 2014). Previous works have shown that the stars in
these galaxies have formed (and the star formation was quenched)
early, the stellar mass is largely assembled before z ∼ 1 (e.g. Lid-
man et al. 2008; Mancone et al. 2010; Strazzullo et al. 2010; Fass-
bender et al. 2014). These galaxies then evolve passively in the
subsequent time (e.g. Andreon 2008; De Propris, Phillipps & Bre-
mer 2013). Nonetheless, the details of how these massive passive

2

cluster galaxies formed and evolved, in particular the physical pro-
cesses involved, remains a matter of debate.

An important component of the above question is the evolu-
tion of the structure of these passive galaxies over time. It has now
been established that galaxies at high redshift are much more com-
pact: those with stellar masses M∗ (cid:62) 1011M(cid:12) at z ∼ 2 have an ef-
fective radius of only (cid:39) 1 kpc (e.g. Daddi et al. 2005; Trujillo et al.
2006a). At z ∼ 0 such massive dense objects are believed to be rel-
atively rare (Trujillo et al. 2009), yet the exact abundance is still
under debate (Valentinuzzi et al. 2010a; Trujillo, Carrasco & Ferré-
Mateu 2012; Poggianti et al. 2013). Previous studies suggest that
massive passive galaxies have grown by a factor of ∼ 2 in size since
z ∼ 1 (e.g. Trujillo et al. 2006b; Longhetti et al. 2007; Cimatti et al.
2008; van der Wel et al. 2008; Saglia et al. 2010; Beiﬁori et al.
2014), and a factor of ∼ 4 since z ∼ 2 (e.g. Trujillo et al. 2007;
Buitrago et al. 2008; van Dokkum et al. 2008; Newman et al. 2012;
Szomoru, Franx & van Dokkum 2012; Barro et al. 2013; van der
Wel et al. 2014). This progressive growth appears to happen mainly
at the outer envelopes, as several works have shown that massive
(M∗ (cid:38) 1× 1011M(cid:12)) passive galaxies at high-redshift have compa-
rable central densities to local ellipticals, suggesting the mass as-
semble took place mainly at outer radii over cosmic time (i.e. the
“inside-out” growth scenario, Bezanson et al. 2009; van Dokkum
et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2013).

To explain the observed evolution, the physical processes in-
voked have to result in a large growth in size but not in stellar mass,
nor drastic increase in the star formation rate. Most plausible candi-
dates are mass-loss driven adiabatic expansion (“pufﬁng-up”) (e.g.
Fan et al. 2008, 2010; Ragone-Figueroa & Granato 2011) and dry
mergers scenarios (e.g. Bezanson et al. 2009; Naab, Johansson &
Ostriker 2009; Trujillo, Ferreras & de La Rosa 2011). In the former
scenario, galaxies experience a mass loss from wind driven by ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGN) or supernovae feedback, which lead to
an expansion in size due to a change in the gravitational potential.
In the latter, mergers either major involving merging with another
galaxy of comparable mass, or minor that involves accretion of low
mass companions, have to be dry to keep the low star formation rate
(Trujillo, Ferreras & de La Rosa 2011). Nevertheless, major merg-
ers are not compatible with the observed growth in mass function in
clusters as well as the observed major merger rates since z ∼ 1 (e.g.
Nipoti, Londrillo & Ciotti 2003; Bundy et al. 2009). On the other
hand, minor mergers are able to produce an efﬁcient size growth
(see e.g. Trujillo, Ferreras & de La Rosa 2011; Shankar et al. 2013).
The rates of minor mergers are roughly enough to account for the
size evolution only up to z (cid:46) 1 Newman et al. (2012), at z ∼ 2 ad-
ditional mechanisms are required (e.g. AGN feedback-driven star
formation Ishibashi, Fabian & Canning 2013). In addition, the ef-
fect of continual quenched galaxies onto the red sequence as well
as morphological mixing (known as the “progenitor bias”) further
complicates the situation (e.g van Dokkum & Franx 2001). Pro-
cesses that are speciﬁc in clusters such as harassment, strangula-
tion and ram-pressure stripping (e.g. Treu et al. 2003; Moran et al.
2007) might play an important role in quenching and morpholog-
ically transforming galaxies. Several studies have already shown
that the progenitor bias has a non-negligible effect on the size evo-
lution (e.g. Saglia et al. 2010; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010b; Carollo
et al. 2013; Poggianti et al. 2013; Beiﬁori et al. 2014; Delaye et al.
2014; Belli, Newman & Ellis 2015; Shankar et al. 2015).

In addition to size or structural parameter measurements,
colour gradients also provide valuable information for disentan-
gling the underlying physical processes involved in the evolution
of passive galaxies, and have been used as tracers of stellar popu-

lation properties and their radial variation. In local and intermedi-
ate redshift passive galaxies, colour gradients are mainly attributed
to metallicity gradients (e.g. Saglia et al. 2000; La Barbera et al.
2005; Tortora et al. 2010), although also affected by age and dust
(see, e.g. Vulcani et al. 2014). Measuring the colour gradients at
high redshift is more challenging due to compact galaxy sizes and
limitations on instrumental angular resolution. Passive galaxies at
high redshift appear to show negative colour gradients, in the sense
that the core is redder than the outskirts (e.g. Wuyts et al. 2010;
Guo et al. 2011; Szomoru et al. 2011), implying a radial variation
in the stellar mass-to-light ratio (hereafter M∗/L).

Due to M∗/L gradients within the galaxies, the size of the
galaxies measured from surface brightness proﬁles (i.e. luminosity-
weighted sizes) is not always a reliable proxy of the mass distribu-
tion, especially at high redshifts when the growth of the passive
galaxies is more rapid. Hence, measuring characteristic sizes of the
mass distribution (i.e. mass-weighted sizes) is preferable over the
wavelength dependent luminosity-weighted sizes. Recently a num-
ber of works attempted to reconstruct stellar mass proﬁles taking
into account the M∗/L gradients primarily using two techniques:
resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁtting (e.g. Wuyts et al.
2012; Lang et al. 2014) and the use of a scaling M∗/L - colour rela-
tion (e.g. Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et al. 2003). In the former, stel-
lar population modeling is performed on resolved multi-band pho-
tometry to infer spatial variations in the stellar population in 2D.
While this is a powerful way to derive resolved properties, deep
and high-resolution multi-band imaging are required to well con-
strain the SED in each resolved region, which is not available for
most datasets. The latter method, demonstrated by Zibetti, Charlot
& Rix (2009) and Szomoru et al. (2013), relies on a M∗/L - colour
relation to determine the spatial variation of M∗/L. Although this
method cannot disentangle the degeneracy between age, dust and
metallicity, it provides a relatively inexpensive way to study the
mass distribution of galaxies.

In this study, we analyse a sample of 36 passive galaxies in
the massive cluster XMMUJ2235-2557 at z ∼ 1.39. We focus on
their light-weighted sizes (in rest-frame optical, from the near-IR
HST/WFC3 images), resolved stellar mass distribution, as well as
mass-weighted sizes and colour gradients. This paper is organised
as follows. The sample and data used in this study are described
in Section 2. Object selection, photometry, structural analysis, and
the procedure to derive resolved stellar mass surface density maps
are described in Section 3. We also examine the reliability of our
derived parameters with simulated galaxies and present the results
in the same section. In Section 4 we describe the local sample we
used for comparison. In Section 5 we present the main results, in-
cluding both light-weighted and mass-weighted structural parame-
ters derived from the stellar mass surface density maps, colour and
M∗/L gradients. The results are then compared with the local sam-
ple, and discussed in Section 6. Lastly, in Section 7 we draw our
conclusions.

Throughout the paper, we assume the standard ﬂat cosmol-
ogy with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.7 and Ωm = 0.3. With
this cosmological model at redshift 1.39, 1 arcsec corresponds to
8.4347 kpc. Magnitudes quoted are in the AB system (Oke &
Gunn 1983). The stellar masses in this paper are computed with
a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF). Quoted published
values are transformed to Chabrier IMF when necessary.

2 DATA
2.1 Sample

The cluster XMMUJ2235-2257 was serendipitously detected in an
X-ray observation of a nearby galaxy by XMM-Newton and dis-
covered by Mullis et al. (2005). Subsequent VLT/FORS2 spec-
troscopy conﬁrmed the redshift of the cluster to be z ∼ 1.39. Rosati
et al. (2009) conﬁrmed the cluster membership of 34 galaxies.
Among them 16 within the central 1 Mpc are passive. Jee et al.
(2009) performed a weak-lensing analysis on the cluster and es-
timated the projected mass of the cluster to be ∼ 8.5× 1014 M(cid:12),
making it one of the most massive clusters seen at high-redshift.
Grützbauch et al. (2012) studied the star formation in this cluster
out to a projected radius of 1.5 Mpc and found that all massive
galaxies have low speciﬁc star formation rates, and galaxies in the
cluster centre have lower speciﬁc star formation rates than the rest
of the cluster galaxies at ﬁxed stellar mass. For the galaxy structural
properties, this cluster has been investigated by Strazzullo et al.
(2010) and was also included in the cluster sample of Delaye et al.
(2014) and De Propris, Bremer & Phillipps (2015).

2.2 HST imaging

We make use of the deep optical and IR archival imaging of the
cluster XMMUJ2235-2557, obtained with HST/ACS WFC and
HST/WFC3 in June 2005 (PID 10698), July 2006 (PID 10496) and
April 2010 (PID 12051). The ACS data are mostly from a program
designed to search for Type Ia supernovae in galaxy clusters (Daw-
son et al. 2009), while the WFC3 data are from a calibration pro-
gram aiming at cross-calibrating the zero point of WFC3 and NIC-
MOS. The HST/ACS data consists of F775W and F850LP bands
(hereafter i775 and z850), while the WFC3 data comprises four IR
bands, F105W, F110W, F125W and F160W (hereafter Y105, Y J110,
J125 and H160). The Y J110 data is not used in this study as it has a
shorter exposure time. The WFC3 data has a smaller ﬁeld of view
than the ACS data, 145(cid:48)(cid:48) × 126(cid:48)(cid:48). A summary of the observational
setup can be found in Table 1.

Data in each band are reduced and combined using Astrodriz-
zle, an upgraded version of the Multidrizzle package in the PyRAF
interface (Gonzaga et al. 2012). Relative WCS offsets between in-
dividual frames are ﬁrst corrected using the tweakreg task before
drizzling. The ACS and WFC3 images have been drizzled to pixel
scales of 0.05 and 0.09 arcsec pixel−1 respectively. The full-width-
half-maximum (FWHM) of the PSF is ∼0.11 arcsec for the ACS
data and ∼0.18 arcsec for the WFC3 data, measured from median
stacked stars. We produce weight maps using both inverse vari-
ance map (IVM) and error map (ERR) settings for different purposes.
The IVM weight maps, which contain all background noise sources
except Poisson noise of the objects, are used for object detection,
while the ERR weight maps are used for structural analysis as the

Poisson noise of the objects is included. Due to the nature of the
drizzle process, the resulting drizzled images have correlated pixel-
to-pixel noise. To correct for this we follow Casertano et al. (2000)
to apply a scaling factor to the weight maps. Absolute WCS cal-
ibrations of the drizzled images are derived using GAIA (Graph-
ical Astronomy and Image analysis Tool) in the Starlink library
(Berry et al. 2013) with Guide Star Catalog II (GSC-II) (Lasker
et al. 2008).

3 ANALYSIS

3.1 Object detection, sample selection, and photometry

3.1.1 Method

The WFC3 H160 image, the reddest available band, is used for ob-
ject detection with SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The multi-
band photometry is obtained with SExtractor in dual image mode
with the H160 image as the detection image. MAG_AUTO magnitudes
are used for galaxy magnitudes and aperture magnitudes are used
for colour measurements. We use a ﬁxed circular aperture size of
1(cid:48)(cid:48) in diameter. The effective radii of most galaxies in the clus-
ter are generally much smaller than the aperture size. Galactic ex-
tinction is corrected using the dust map of Schlegel, Finkbeiner &
Davis (1998) and the recalibration E(B-V) value from Schlaﬂy &
Finkbeiner (2011).

As described in the introduction, Grützbauch et al. (2012)
studied the star formation in the cluster out to a projected radius
of 1.5 Mpc. We cross-match our SExtractor catalogue to theirs
to identify spectroscopically conﬁrmed cluster members from pre-
vious literature (Mullis et al. 2005; Lidman et al. 2008; Rosati
et al. 2009). 12 out of 14 spectroscopically conﬁrmed cluster mem-
bers are within the WFC3 FOV and identiﬁed. Figure 1 shows
the colour-magnitude diagram of the detected sources within the
WFC3 FOV. We identify passive galaxies through ﬁtting the red se-
quence from the colour-magnitude diagram. We measure the scat-
ter through rectifying the z850−H160 colour with our ﬁtted relation,
then marginalise over the H160 magnitude to obtain a number distri-
bution of the galaxies. The dotted lines correspond to ±2σ derived
from a Gaussian ﬁt to the number distribution.

Objects that are within 2σ from the ﬁtted red-sequence are
selected as the passive sample. We trim the sample by removing
point sources indicated by SExtractor (i.e. those with class_star
(cid:62) 0.9) and applying a magnitude cut of H160 < 22.5, which cor-
responds to a completeness of ∼95% (see below). This selection
results in a sample of 36 objects in the cluster XMMUJ2235-2557.

3.1.2 Quantifying the uncertainties on the photometry

Since the photometric uncertainties are folded directly into our
mass estimates as well as the structural parameters measurements,
a realistic estimate of the photometric uncertainties is required. Pre-
vious works have shown that SExtractor tends to underestimate
the photometric uncertainties and there can be a small systematic
shift between MAG_AUTO output and the true magnitudes (Häussler
et al. 2007). Hence, we perform an extensive galaxy magnitude
and colour test with a set of 50000 simulated galaxies with sur-
face brightness proﬁles described by a Sérsic proﬁle on the ACS
z850 and WFC3 H160 band images. This set of galaxies is also used
for assessing the completeness and accuracy of the light and mass
structural parameter measurements. Details of the simulations can

H160 magnitudes are MAG_AUTO magnitudes while the z850 − H160 colour
are 1(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture magnitudes. The dashed line corresponds to the ﬁtted red
sequence and the dotted lines are ±2σ. Green circles correspond to objects
that are included in our sample, which are within the dotted line and are
not in the shaded area (i.e. H160 < 22.5). Objects that are spectroscopically

be found in Appendix A. Here we focus on the photometric uncer-
tainties estimates.

The detection rate above a certain magnitude reﬂects the com-
pleteness of the sample at that particular magnitude cut. We ﬁnd
that a magnitude cut of H160 < 22.5 corresponds to a completeness
of ∼95%. We then assess the accuracy of the recovered magnitudes
and colours. Since the accuracies depend strongly on both input
magnitude (magin) as well as the effective semi-major axis (ae) of
the galaxies, we assess the accuracy in terms of input mean surface
e) in mag arcsec−2) rather than
brightness (Σ = magin +2.5log(2πa2
input magnitudes. Below we quote the results at a mean surface
brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec−2 in H160 (or 24.5 mag arcsec−2 in
z850) as a benchmark, as most objects we considered are brighter
than 23.5 mag arcsec−2.
For ACS z850, the typical 1σ uncertainty for the MAG_AUTO
output at mean surface brightness of 24.5 mag arcsec−2 is ∼0.33
mag. For WFC3 H160, at a mean surface brightness of 23.5 mag
arcsec−2 the typical 1σ uncertainty is ∼0.19 mag. Previous studies
have shown that SExtractor MAG_AUTO misses a certain amount of
ﬂux especially for the faint objects (e.g. Bertin & Arnouts 1996;
Labbé et al. 2003; Taylor et al. 2009a). We ﬁnd a systematic shift
for both ﬁlters towards low surface brightness, the shifts are on
average ∼ 0.42 mag for a H160 mean surface brightness of 23.5
mag arcsec−2 or ∼ 0.50 mag for a z850 mean surface brightness of
24.5 mag arcsec−2.

On the other hand, we ﬁnd no systematics between the input
and recovered aperture colour. Figure 2 shows the result for the
z850 − H160 colour from simulated galaxies. The uncertainties on
colour are small i.e. ∼ 0.07 mag for a H160 mean surface brightness
of 23.5 mag arcsec−2. The uncertainty in colour tends to be larger
for objects with redder z850−H160 colour, solely due to the fact that
the z850 aperture magnitude has a larger uncertainty for a redder
colour.

H160 = (z850 − H160)out − (z850 − H160)in as a function of input mean H160
surface brightness. The green line indicates the median and 1σ dispersion
in different bins (0.5 mag arcsec−2 bin width), and the grey-shaded 2D his-
togram shows the number density distribution of the simulated galaxies.

3.2 Light-weighted structural parameters

3.2.1 Method

We measure the light-weighted structural parameters of the passive
galaxies in ﬁve HST bands (i775, z850, Y105, J125 and H160) using a
modiﬁed version of GALAPAGOS (Barden et al. 2012). For each
object detected by SExtractor, GALAPAGOS generates a postage
stamp and measures the local sky level around the object using an
elliptical annulus ﬂux growth method. This local sky level is then
used by GALFIT (v.3.0.5, Peng et al. 2002), in order to model the
galaxy surface brightness proﬁle. We examine different settings of
the sky estimation routine in GALAPAGOS to ensure the robust-
ness of the results. Since the ACS and WFC3 images have a differ-
ent spatial resolution, we modify GALAPAGOS to allow the use
of a single detection catalogue (in our case, the H160 band) in all
bands. The code is further adjusted to use the RMS maps derived
from the ERR weight maps output by Astrodrizzle.

As shown in Häussler et al. (2007), contamination by neigh-
bouring objects has to be accounted while ﬁtting galaxy surface
brightness proﬁles, especially in regions where the object density
is high. To deal with this issue, adjacent sources are identiﬁed from
the SExtractor segmentation map and are masked out or ﬁtted si-
multaneously if their light proﬁles have a non-negligible inﬂuence
to the central object. We ﬁt a two-dimensional Sérsic proﬁle (Sérsic
1963) to each galaxy, which can be written as

where Γ(2n) is the complete gamma function.

The Sérsic proﬁle of a galaxy can be characterised by ﬁve in-
dependent parameters: the total luminosity Ltot, the Sérsic index
n, the effective semi-major axis ae, the axis ratio q (= b/a, where
a and b is the major and minor axis respectively) and the posi-
tion angle P.A.. The parameter bn is a function of the Sérsic index
(Γ(2n) = 2γ(2n,bn), where γ is the incomplete gamma function)
and can only be solved numerically (Ciotti 1991). All ﬁve param-
eters as well as the centroid (x,y) are left to be free parameters in
our ﬁtting process with GALFIT. The constraints of each parame-
ter for GALFIT are set to be: 0.2 < n < 8, 0.3 < ae < 500 (pix),

tractor catalogue or appearance of extra structures / sources in bluer
bands, e.g. z850 band, compare to our H160 detection catalogue) can
lead to signiﬁcant residuals that adversely affect the ﬁt of the pri-
mary object. Similarly, since GALAPAGOS ﬁts sources with a sin-
gle Sérsic proﬁle by default, GALFIT will likely give unphysical
outputs for unresolved sources / stars in the ﬁeld (with ae hitting
the lower boundary of the constraint ae = 0.3 pix, or Sérsic index
hitting the upper boundary n = 8) or even not converging in these
cases, which again affects the result of the object of primary in-
terest. Moreover, the best-ﬁt output can vary if we use a different
treatment for neighbouring sources. We notice that in a few cases
the results can be very different depending upon whether neigh-
bouring sources are masked or are ﬁtted simultaneously.

To ensure high reliability, we perform the following checks
for each galaxy: 1) We visually inspect the ﬁts as well as the seg-
mentation maps (output by SExtractor) in each band to ensure ad-
jacent sources are well-ﬁtted. Extra Sérsic components are added
to poorly ﬁtted neighbouring objects iteratively if necessary. 2) For
neighbours for which GALFIT gives ill-constrained results (i.e. hit-
ting the boundaries of the constraints), we replace the Sérsic model
with a PSF model and rerun the ﬁt, which often improves the con-
vergence and the quality of the best-ﬁt model. Regarding this, Bar-
den et al. (2012) explained the need of ﬁtting Sérsic proﬁles to sat-
urated stars instead of PSF model in GALAPAGOS, since the PSF
often lacks the dynamic range to capture the diffraction spikes of
the bright saturated stars. In our case this is not necessary since
there are only a few bright saturated stars in the ﬁeld, for which
we can safely mask their diffraction spikes. 3) We compare the re-
sults of masking and simultaneously ﬁtting neighbouring objects.
In most cases the two methods give results that are within 1σ. For
galaxies with close neighbours (e.g. within 5 ae) we prefer to ﬁt
them simultaneously as any inadequate or over-masking can result
in problematic ﬁts, judging by examining the residual map output
by GALFIT. On the other hand, masking is more suitable when the
neighbouring object are not axisymmetric or show certain substruc-
tures, which causes the single Sérsic ﬁt to not reach convergence.

3.2.3 Quantifying the uncertainties in light-weighted structural

parameters

We quantify the systematic uncertainties using the set of 50000
simulated galaxies inserted on the images. In this section we fo-
cus on the result of the test; details of the simulations can be found
in Appendix A3. Note that the uncertainties quoted here are more
likely to represent lower limits to the true uncertainties, as the sim-
ulated galaxies are also parametrised with a Se´rsic proﬁle.

Figure 4 shows the comparison between the input and recov-
ered magnitudes and structural parameters for the H160 band. The
magnitudes recovered by Sérsic proﬁle ﬁtting are accurate with
almost no systematics and a 1σ dispersion less than 0.25 for ob-
jects having mean H160 surface brightness brighter than 23.5 mag
arcsec−2. The Sérsic index, effective radius and axis ratio measure-
ments are generally robust for objects brighter than a mean H160
surface brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec−2. The bias between the re-
covered and input Sérsic indices is less than 8% and the 1σ disper-
sion is lower than 30%. Effective radii have a bias less than 4% and
a 1σ dispersion lower than 30% for objects brighter than H160 sur-
face brightness of 23.5 mag arcsec−2. For objects with high mean
surface brightness (i.e. < 19 mag arcsec−2) in our simulated sam-
ple, the effective radii are slightly overestimated (∼ 2%) and the
Sérsic indices are underestimated (∼ −4%) by GALFIT. We ﬁnd

level on the other hand, is ﬁxed to the value determined by GALA-
PAGOS.

The Sérsic model is convolved with the PSF constructed from
stacking bright unsaturated stars in the images. Note that we have
also tried to derive a TinyTim PSF composite by adding PSF mod-
els using the TinyTim code (Krist 1995) into the raw data and
drizzling them as science images. Nevertheless, we notice that the
TinyTim drizzled PSF does not match well the empirical PSF in
the outer part: a much stronger outer envelope (as well as diffrac-
tion spikes) can be seen in the empirical PSF (see also, Appendix A
in Bruce et al. 2012, for a similar description). On the other hand,
van der Wel et al. (2012) produced hybrid PSF models by replac-
ing the central pixels of the median-stacked star by the TinyTim
PSF. We do not employ this correction as we ﬁnd that the median-
stacked star matches the TinyTim PSF reasonably well in the inner
part.

The best-ﬁtting light-weighted parameters are listed in Ta-
ble F1 in Appendix F. Two galaxies (ID 170, 642) and their best-ﬁts
are shown in Figure 3 for illustrative purposes. These two objects
have been chosen to show the impact of clustering of sources in
dense regions. Even in the cluster centre where there are multiple
neighbouring objects, GALFIT can do a good job in determining
the structural parameters by ﬁtting multiple object simultaneously.
Below we discuss the reliability and uncertainties in these light-
weighted structural parameters.

3.2.2 Reliability of the ﬁtted structural parameters

GALAPAGOS coupled with GALFIT performs well in most cases.
However in some exceptions, it is rather tricky to obtain a good-
quality ﬁt due to various issues. We are not referring here to the
global systematics and uncertainties (which are addressed in the
next section), but on stability and quality control of individual ﬁts.
We ﬁnd that using an inadequate number of ﬁtting components for

out that this bias is due to unresolved objects in our simulations. A
related discussion can be found in Appendix A3.

We have also performed the same test on a simulated back-
ground similar to the actual images (where the main difference is
that the simulated background has no issue of neighbour contam-
ination), and ﬁnd that the uncertainties on the effective radius are
on average ∼ 15− 20% lower compared to those derived from real
images.

For each galaxy in the sample, we compute the mean H160 sur-
face brightness and add the corresponding dispersion in quadrature
to the error output by GALFIT.

3.3 Elliptical aperture photometry and color gradients
In addition to structural parameters, we derive z850 − H160 colour
proﬁles for the passive sample with PSF-matched elliptical annular

photometry. We ﬁrst convert the 2D image in both bands into 1D
radial surface brightness proﬁles. Morishita et al. (2015) demon-
strated that deriving 1D proﬁles with elliptical apertures has certain
advantages over circular apertures. Proﬁles derived with concentric
circular apertures are biased to be more centrally concentrated. We
perform an elliptical annular photometry on the PSF-matched z850
and H160 images at the galaxy centroid derived from GALFIT. The
GALFIT best-ﬁt axis ratios and position angles of individual galax-
ies (in H160 band) are used to derive a set of elliptical apertures for
each galaxy.

Due to the proximity of objects in the cluster, it is necessary
to take into account (as in 2D ﬁtting) the effect of the neighbour-
ing objects. The neighbouring objects are ﬁrst removed from the
image by subtracting their best Sérsic ﬁt (or PSF ﬁt in some cases)
in both bands. While the ﬁt might not be perfect, we ﬁnd that this
extra step can remove the majority of the ﬂux of the neighbouring
objects contributing to surface brightness proﬁles. For some galax-
ies the colour proﬁles show substantial change after we apply the
correction.
We then measure the colour gradients of individual galaxies
by ﬁtting the logarithmic slope of their z850 − H160 colour proﬁles
along the major axis, which are deﬁned as follows:
z850 − H160 = ∇z850−H160 × log(a) + Z.P.
(3)
At redshift 1.39 this corresponds roughly to the rest-frame (U − R)
colour gradient. The depth and angular resolution of our WFC3
data allow us to derive a 1D colour proﬁle accurately to ∼ 3− 4 ae,
hence the colour gradient is ﬁtted in the radial range of PSF half-
width-half-maximum (HWHM) < a < 3.5 ae. We note that the
colour gradients of most galaxies, as well as the median colour gra-
dient, do not strongly depend on the adopted ﬁtting radial range.
Figure 5 shows the colour proﬁles and logarithmic gradient ﬁts of
four passive galaxies as an example. The colour proﬁles are in gen-
eral well-described by logarithmic ﬁts.

3.4 Stellar mass-to-light ratio – colour relation

We estimate the stellar mass-to-light ratios of the cluster galaxies
in XMMUJ2235-2557 using an empirical relation between the ob-
served z850−H160 colour and stellar mass-to-light ratio (M∗/L). At
redshift 1.39, the z850 − H160 colour (rest-frame U − R) straddles
the 4000 break. Hence, this colour is sensitive to variations in the
properties of the stellar population (i.e. stellar age, dust and metal-
licity). In addition, the effects of these variations are relatively de-
generate on the colour - M∗/L plane (almost parallel to the relation,
Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et al. 2003; Szomoru et al. 2013), which
makes this colour a useful proxy for the M∗/L.

We derive the relation using the NEWFIRM medium band sur-
vey (NMBS) catalogue, which combines existing ground-based and
space-based UV to mid-IR data, and new near-IR medium band
NEWFIRM data in the AEGIS and COSMOS ﬁelds (Whitaker
et al. 2011). The entire catalogue comprises photometries in 37
(20) bands, high accuracy photometric redshifts derived with EAZY
(Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi 2008) and spectroscopic redshifts
for a subset of the sample in COSMOS (AEGIS). Stellar masses
and dust reddening estimates are also included in the catalogue,
and are estimated by SED ﬁtting using FAST (Kriek et al. 2009).

To derive the M∗/L-colour relation, we use the stellar masses
from the NMBS catalogue in COSMOS estimated with stellar pop-
ulation models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003), an exponentially de-
clining SFHs, and computed with a Chabrier (2003) IMF. We do
not use the sample in AEGIS as it contains photometries with fewer

ity LH160of each galaxy in the observed H160 band, from which we
calculate the stellar mass-to-light ratio M∗/LH160. We select NMBS
galaxies within a redshift window of 0.1 of the cluster redshift, i.e.
1.29 < z < 1.49, and apply the magnitude cut (H160 < 22.5) and a
chi-square cut (χ2 < 2.0, from template ﬁtting in EAZY) to better
match the cluster sample.

A total of 718 objects are selected by this criterion. A redshift
correction is applied to these 718 galaxies to redshift their spec-
tra to the cluster redshift (i.e. similar to k-correction in observer
frame). We then measure their z850 − H160 colour and LH160 in the
observer frame. This redshift correction is effective in reducing the
scatter of the relation, indicating that some of (but not all) the scat-
ter is simply due to difference in redshifts. Figure 6 shows the ﬁtted
relation between log(M∗/LH160) and z850 − H160 colour. The black
line is the best-ﬁt linear relation with:

log((M∗/LH160 )/(M(cid:12)/L(cid:12))) = 0.625 (z850 − H160)− 1.598

(4)

The relation is well-deﬁned within a colour range of 0.4 <
z850 − H160 < 2.2 (hence we choose the same range for our sim-
ulated galaxies, see Appendix A). The global scatter of the ﬁt is
∼ 0.06 dex. In the lower panel of Figure 6 we plot the residuals
of the ﬁt in colour bins of 0.1. The uncertainty in log(M∗/L) is
generally < 0.1 in each bin and the bias is negligible. The remain-
ing scatter results from redshift uncertainties and stellar population
variations (age, dust and metallicity), as their effects are not exactly
parallel to the relation. Note that this can lead to small systematics
in measuring mass-to-light ratios and the mass-to-light ratio gradi-
ents. For example in metal-rich or old regions the mass-to-light ra-
tio will likely be systematically slightly underestimated, and over-
estimated in metal-poor or young regions (Szomoru et al. 2013).

observed z850 − H160 colour for all NMBS galaxies. Note that we
do not adopt the typical approach to interpolate the cluster data to
obtain a rest-frame colour (e.g. with InterRest, Taylor et al. 2009b)
due to limited availability of bands, which would likely lead to de-
generacy in choices of templates. Firstly, we rerun EAZY for all
NMBS galaxies to obtain the best-ﬁt SED template, these SEDs
are then integrated with the ACS z850 and WFC3 H160 ﬁlter re-
sponse for the z850 − H160 colour. Similarly we obtain the luminos-

Integrated stellar masses

3.5
We estimate the integrated stellar masses (M∗) of the cluster galax-
ies using our M∗/L-colour relation, the z850−H160 aperture colours
and the total luminosity LH160 from best-ﬁt Sérsic models. The un-
certainties in stellar mass comprise photometric uncertainties in the
colour and H160 luminosity, as well as the scatter in the derived
colour - M∗/L relation. The typical uncertainty of the masses is
∼ 0.1 dex, comparable to the uncertainties obtained from SED ﬁt-
ting.

Previous literature computed SED mass with multi-band
MAG_AUTO photometry obtained with SExtractor (e.g. for this clus-
ter, Strazzullo et al. 2010; Delaye et al. 2014). Nevertheless, as we
have shown in Section 3.1.2, it is known that MAG_AUTO can be
systematically biased, due to the assumption in SExtractor that the
sky background comprises only random noise without source con-
fusion (Brown et al. 2007). Hence, more recent studies use the to-
tal luminosity from best-ﬁt Sérsic models to correct the masses to
account for the missing ﬂux in MAG_AUTO (Bernardi et al. 2013;
Bezanson et al. 2013). In our case, we have demonstrated that total
luminosity from the best-ﬁt Sérsic models can recover input galaxy
magnitudes to a high accuracy. Hence, we scale our masses with
the total luminosity LH160 from best-ﬁt Sérsic models rather than
H160 MAG_AUTO magnitudes. We also compute masses with H160
MAG_AUTO; the difference between the two is small for our sample,
with (cid:104)M∗,MAG_AUTO − M∗,Sersic(cid:105) = −0.039 dex.

For this particular cluster, Delaye et al. (2014) estimated the
galaxies masses through SED ﬁtting with four bands (HST/ACS
i775, z850, HAWK-I J, Ks), which also gave an uncertainty of ∼0.1
dex in mass. The masses derived with our method are consistent
with the SED masses in Delaye et al. (2014) within the uncertain-
ties. A comparison of masses estimated using M∗/L-colour rela-
tion with masses computed using SED ﬁtting can be found in Ap-
pendix C. The uncertainty of the absolute stellar masses is of course
larger (as in the case of SED ﬁtting), depending on the details of
NMBS SED ﬁtting and e.g. choice of IMF.

3.6 Resolved stellar mass surface density maps
We further exploit the M∗/L-colour relation to derive stellar mass
surface density maps. This allows us to study the mass distribution
within each galaxy, at the same time eliminating the effect of inter-
nal colour gradient which inﬂuences the light-weighted size mea-
surements. Below we describe the main steps involved in deriving
stellar mass surface density maps with the M∗/L-colour relation.

3.6.1 PSF matching
We ﬁrst match the resolution of the ACS z850 image (∼ 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)) to the
WFC3 H160 image (∼ 0.18(cid:48)(cid:48)). PSF matching is critical in this kind
of study as the measured colour has to come from the same phys-
ical projected region. We stack the unsaturated stars for each band
to obtain characteristic PSFs, then generate a kernel that matches
the z850 to H160 PSF using the psfmatch task in IRAF. The differ-
ence between the resultant z850 PSF and the H160 PSF is less than
2.5%. Details of the PSF matching can be found in Appendix B.
We then apply the kernel to the ACS z850 image. The PSF matched
z850 image is resampled to the same grid as the H160 image using
the software SWarp (Bertin et al. 2002). We then generate postage
stamps of each galaxy in both H160 and PSF matched z850 images
for deriving resolved stellar mass surface density maps.

3.6.2 From colour to stellar mass surface density
The next step is to convert the z850 − H160 colour information
into mass-to-light ratios with the M∗/L-colour relation described
in Section 3.4. Nevertheless, a direct pixel-to-pixel conversion is
not possible for our data. The conversion requires a certain min-
imum signal-to-noise (S/N) level because: a) signiﬁcant biases
or massive uncertainties may arise if colours are not well mea-
sured. b) our relation is only calibrated within the colour range of
0.4 < z850 − H160 < 2.2. Any low S/N colour that falls outside the
calibrated range could convert to an unphysical M∗/L.

Therefore, we adopt the Voronoi binning algorithm as de-
scribed by Cappellari & Copin (2003), grouping pixels to a tar-
get S/N level of 10 per bin. For each galaxy, we run the Voronoi
binning algorithm on the sky-subtracted PSF-matched z850 band
postage stamps as a reference, as it has a lower S/N compared to the
H160 image. The same binning scheme is then applied to the sky-
subtracted H160 image. The subtracted sky levels are determined
by GALAPAGOS. The two images are then converted into magni-
tudes. Binned z850 − H160 colour maps are obtained by subtracting
the two. We then construct a binned M∗/L map by converting the
colour in each bin to a mass-to-light ratio with the derived colour -
M∗/L relation.

An extrapolation scheme is implemented to determine the
M∗/L in regions or bins with insufﬁcient S/N, for example in the
galaxy outskirts and the sky regions. We ﬁrst run an annular av-
erage to derive a 1-dimensional S/N proﬁle in z850 for individual
galaxies using the light-weighted galaxy centroid, axis ratio and
position angle determined in Section 3.2. For the area outside the
elliptical radius that has a S/N less than half of our target S/N (i.e.
S/N ∼ 5), we ﬁx the M∗/L to the annular median of M∗/L bins at
the last radius with sufﬁcient S/N. We ﬁnd that this extrapolation
is crucial for the following structural analysis as the sky noise is
preserved (see the discussion in Appendix A4).

We construct resolved stellar mass surface density maps (here-
after referred to as mass maps) by directly combining the extrap-
olated M∗/L map and the original (i.e. unbinned) H160 images.
Figure 7 illustrates the procedure of deriving mass maps from the
z850 and H160 images. Using the original H160 image instead of the
binned one allows us to preserve the WFC3 spatial resolution in
the mass maps. Note that in theory combining a binned (i.e. spa-
tially discrete) M∗/L map with a smooth luminosity image would
result in a discrete mass proﬁle in low S/N region, in order words,
induce an “discretization effect" in the mass maps. This effect is
more severe in low S/N regions, i.e. the galaxy outskirts where the
bins are larger (hence less smooth). For bright galaxies, since there
are more bins with sufﬁcient S/N and the dynamical range of the
light distribution (surface brightness gradient) is much larger than
the M∗/L gradient, this appears to have minimal effect and does
not largely affect our result. For fainter galaxies this issue is non-
negligible. To tackle this, for each galaxy we perform the above
binning procedure 10 times, each with a slightly different set of
initial Voronoi nodes. This ends up with a set of M∗/L maps which
are then median-stacked to create the ﬁnal mass map. This extra
step alleviates the discretization effect.

3.7 Mass-weighted structural parameters

3.7.1 Method

We measure mass-weighted structural parameters from the re-
solved stellar mass surface density maps. We follow a similar
procedure as with the light-weighted structural parameters, using

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

GALFIT to model the mass proﬁles with two-dimensional Sérsic
proﬁles. All ﬁve parameters of the Sérsic proﬁle (M∗,tot, n, ae, q
and P.A.) and the centroid (x,y) are left to be free parameters in the
ﬁt. We use the same GALFIT constraints as for the light-weighted
structural parameters, except for allowing a larger range for the Sér-
sic indices: 0.2 < n < 15.0. This is because the mass proﬁles are
expected to be more centrally peaked compared to light proﬁles
(Szomoru et al. 2013). As the H160 images are background sub-
tracted before being converted into mass maps, the sky level (i.e.
the mass level) is ﬁxed to zero in the ﬁtting process. The best-ﬁtting
mass-weighted parameters are given in Appendix F1.

3.7.2 Quantifying the uncertainties in mass-weighted parameters

We further assess the accuracy of our mass conversion procedures
as well as the reliability of the mass-weighted structural parameter
measurements. The details of the test are described in Appendix
A4. Similar to the uncertainty in the light-weighted parameters, the
uncertainties quoted here are more likely to represent lower limits
to the true uncertainties.

Figure 8 shows the difference between input and recovered
mass-structural parameters as a function of H160 surface brightness.
The Sérsic index, effective radius and axis ratio measurements are
generally robust for objects brighter than H160 surface brightness
of 23.5 mag arcsec−2. This is important, as it demonstrates that
our mass conversion procedure does not signiﬁcantly bias the re-
sult. The bias between the recovered and input Sérsic indices is
less than 7% and the 1σ dispersion is lower than 40%, and effec-
tive radii have a bias less than 10% and a 1σ dispersion lower than
40%. Among the three parameters, the axis ratio can be recovered
most accurately. Compared with the light uncertainties (Figure 4),
the mass uncertainties in all parameters are ∼ 2 times higher. Sim-
ilar to the light-weighted parameters, for each galaxies we add the
corresponding dispersion in quadrature to the error output by GAL-
FIT.

We ﬁnd that for a couple of objects the ﬁts do not converge,
or have resultant sizes smaller than the PSF size. To avoid biases
and wrong conclusions we remove these objects that are not well-
ﬁtted from the mass parameter sample. 6 objects (out of 36) are
discarded, among them one object is spectroscopically conﬁrmed.
Three of them initially have small light-weighted sizes and their
ﬁtted mass-weighted sizes become smaller than half of the PSF
HWHM, which are unreliable (see the discussion in Appendix A3).
Most of them are low mass galaxies (i.e. log(M∗/M(cid:12)) < 10.5).

3.7.3 Deviation of mass-weighted parameters - 1D vs. 2D

Szomoru et al. (2013) derived 1D mass proﬁles from 1D radial sur-
face brightness proﬁles and measured mass-weighted structural pa-
rameters. In theory, ﬁtting in 1D and in 2D should give identical
results, as statistically ﬁtting an averaged smaller group of points
and ﬁtting all the points without averaging are equivalent (see, Peng
2015, for a detailed discussion.). Nevertheless, in practice deriving
maps and ﬁtting in 2D have certain advantages: a) It does not rely
heavily on the Sérsic proﬁle ﬁtting in light. Deriving elliptical aver-
aged proﬁles require a predetermined axis ratio and position angles,
which, in our case, come from the light Sérsic proﬁle ﬁtting. This
will of course fold in the uncertainties of these two parameters into
the 1D proﬁles, which complicates the propagation of uncertainties
in the mass-weighted parameters. b) In the cluster region, the ob-
ject density is high and many galaxies have very close neighbours.

Hence it will be more appropriate to ﬁt all the sources simulta-
neously to take into account the contribution from the neighbour-
ing objects, rather than deriving 1D proﬁle without deblending the
neighbouring contamination. A possible way to solve this is to ﬁrst
subtract the best-ﬁt 2D models of the neighbours from the 2D im-
ages before generating the 1D proﬁles, but of course this depends
strongly on how well the neighbours can be subtracted, and still
suffer from a).

4 LOCAL COMPARISON SAMPLE

In order to study the evolution of mass-weighted sizes over red-
shift, we compare our cluster sample at z ∼ 1.39 to a local sam-
ple of passive galaxies from the Spheroids Panchromatic Investiga-
tion in Different Environmental Regions (SPIDER) survey (La Bar-
bera et al. 2010b). The publicly available SPIDER sample includes
39993 passive galaxies selected from SDSS Data Release 6 (DR6),
among them 5080 are in the near-infrared UKIRT Infrared Deep
Sky Survey-Large Area Survey Data release (UKIDSS-LAS DR4)
in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095. La Barbera et al. (2010b) de-
rived structural parameters in all available bands (grizY JHK) with
single Sérsic ﬁtting with 2DPhot (La Barbera et al. 2008).

We use the structural parameters in g-band and r-band from
the publicly available multiband structural catalogue from La Bar-
bera et al. (2010b) to derive mass-weighted structural parameters.
For the galaxy selection, we follow similar criteria as La Barbera
et al. (2010b): we apply a magnitude cut at the 95% completeness
magnitude (Mr (cid:54) −20.55), a χ2 cut from the Sérsic ﬁt for both g-
band and r-band (χ2 < 2.0), and a seeing cut at (cid:54) 1.5”. This results
in a sample of 4050 objects. We compute integrated masses for the
sample as in Section 3.5 with aperture g−r colour. The colours are
obtained from direct numeral integration of the g-band and r-band
Sérsic proﬁles to 5 kpc instead of using GALFIT total magnitudes.
Extending the integration limit to larger radius (e.g. 10 kpc) does
not change largely the derived masses. With the g−r colour we de-
rive and select red-sequence galaxies within 2σ following the same
method discussed in Section 3.1; we end up with a sample of 3634
objects (hereafter the SPIDER sample). On top of that we use the
group catalogue from La Barbera et al. (2010c) to select a subsam-
ple of galaxies residing in high density environments. Applying a
halo mass cut to the SPIDER sample of log(M200/M(cid:12)) (cid:62) 14, we
end up with a subsample of 627 objects (hereafter the SPIDER clus-
ter sample), which we will use as the main comparison sample for
our high-redshift cluster galaxies.

2D Sérsic model images in g-band and r-band are then gen-
erated with ﬁtted parameters from the structural catalogue. Given
the large number and relatively low object density of local galaxies
compared to our high redshift cluster sample, using ﬁtted parame-
ters from the structural catalogue is statistically reliable and issues
mentioned in Section 3.7.3 do not contribute substantially here. We
construct mass maps for individual galaxies using the procedure
described in Section 3.6.2 without Voronoi binning and stacking. A
M∗/L-colour relation is again derived from the NMBS sample as in
Section 3.4, but in g-band and r-band at 0 < z < 0.27, a window of
0.2 in redshift around the median redshift of the SPIDER sample. A
total of 1315 NMBS objects are selected. The mass maps are then
ﬁtted with GALFIT to obtain mass-weighted structural parameters.

5.1 Wavelength dependence of light-weighted galaxy sizes

The measured size of a galaxy depends on the observed wave-
length, as different stellar populations are being traced at differ-
ent wavelength (e.g., the “morphological k-correction”, Papovich
et al. 2003). With our multi-band measurements of light-weighted
structural parameters of the cluster passive galaxies, we ﬁrst inves-
tigate the wavelength dependence of galaxy sizes at this redshift.
This wavelength dependence of sizes (or the size-wavelength rela-
tion) has been quantiﬁed for local passive galaxies in a number of
studies (e.g. Barden et al. 2005; Hyde & Bernardi 2009; La Bar-
bera et al. 2010b; Kelvin et al. 2012; Vulcani et al. 2014; Kennedy
et al. 2015). The dependence shown by the above mentioned stud-
ies is quite strong, in the sense that galaxy sizes can decrease up
to ∼ 38% from g through K band in the GAMA sample (Kelvin
et al. 2012), or ∼ 32% across the same range in SPIDER (La Bar-
bera et al. 2010b). Nevertheless, different authors disagree on the
extent of the reduction in sizes in various datasets. For example, in
a recent study Lange et al. (2015) revisited the GAMA sample with
deeper NIR imaging data and found a smaller size decrease, ∼ 13%
from g to Ks band.

At higher redshift, study of wavelength dependence of sizes is
scarce in clusters. The star formation history and age gradient may
contribute signiﬁcantly to the size-wavelength dependence, for ex-
ample the inside-out growth scenario suggests that younger stellar
population are more widespread compared to the older population
in the core of passive galaxies. Various authors have shown that
measured sizes in the observed optical and NIR (i.e. rest-frame UV
vs rest-frame optical for high-redshift galaxies) show a difference
of ∼20–25% (e.g. Trujillo et al. 2007; Cassata et al. 2010; Dam-
janov et al. 2011; Delaye et al. 2014), although some ﬁnd no differ-
ence (Morishita, Ichikawa & Kajisawa 2014). The comparisons are
usually done with only two bands, hence it is unclear whether this
dependence can change with redshift. Recent works from CAN-
DELS studied the wavelength dependence of sizes for 122 early-
type galaxies (ETG) in the COSMOS ﬁeld in three HST bands
(F125W, F140W and F160W) at redshift 0 < z < 2, and found
an average gradient of d log(ae)/d log(λ ) = −0.25 independent of
mass and redshift (van der Wel et al. 2014).

Figure 9 shows the change in size with rest-frame wavelength
for our sample. Here we use the light-weighted effective semi-
major axis ae from GALFIT, as the galaxy size. We assume every
galaxy in the sample is at the cluster redshift. We select 28 galaxies
(out of 36) with no problematic ﬁts in any of the ﬁve bands. The
fraction of problematic ﬁts is larger in i775 and Y105 due to shorter
exposure time and lower throughput of the ﬁlter, which result in
lower S/N. To facilitate comparison with the literature, the sizes in
ﬁgure 9 are normalised with the median H160 sizes of our sample,
which is approximately equal to the rest-frame r-band size. We plot
the best-ﬁtting relation for local spheroids by Kelvin et al. (2012)
and the SPIDER cluster sample, normalised in the same way, for
comparison. We see a smooth variation of sizes decreasing from
i775 to H160 bands (rest-frame u to r). The reduction in the median
size (from i775 to H160) is ∼ 20%, which is consistent with the ex-
pected decrease across this wavelength range (∼ 19%) following
the relation of Kelvin et al. (2012) and the SPIDER cluster sample
(La Barbera et al. 2010b). The average size gradient of our sample
from the best-ﬁt power law is d log(ae)/d log(λ ) = −0.31± 0.27.

We also attempt to divide the sample in mass bins as in
Lange et al. (2015) to investigate the size change with wavelength
for different masses. Lange et al. (2015) showed that the size re-
duction decreases from ∼ 13% for local passive galaxies with
log(M∗/M(cid:12)) = 10.0 to ∼ 11% for those with log(M∗/M(cid:12)) = 11.0.
On the other hand, van der Wel et al. (2014) reported no dis-
cernible trends with mass in CANDELS. We split the sample in
half at the median mass (log(M∗/M(cid:12)) (cid:54) 10.6 and log(M∗/M(cid:12)) >
10.6, 14 objects per bin), plotted in grey and slate grey in Fig-
ure 9. A steeper dependence can be seen for the high mass bins
(d log(ae)/d log(λ ) = −0.57± 0.28) compared to the whole sam-
ple, while the low mass bins (d log(ae)/d log(λ ) = −0.29± 0.34)
have the same if not slightly shallower wavelength dependence
within the uncertainties. This is the opposite to the ﬁnding of Lange
et al. (2015). Nevertheless, the size gradients of the two bins are
within 1σ, a larger sample is needed to conﬁrm the mass depen-
dence.

Kelvin et al. (2012). Grey and slate grey are the median sizes for two mass

Cappellari 2013). We pick the single Sérsic ﬁt relation in Bernardi
et al. (2012) for consistency, which is shown to have slightly larger
sizes than the two-component exponential + Sérsic ﬁt relation.

Hyde & Bernardi (2009) ﬁrst demonstrated that the mass-size
relation of passive galaxies shows curvature and Bernardi et al.
(2012) ﬁtted the curvature with a second order polynomial; their
best-ﬁt values were consistent with Simard et al. (2011). As we
have shown in the last section, size shows wavelength-dependence,
hence care has to be taken to ensure the sizes being compared are at
around the same rest-frame wavelength. The Bernardi et al. (2012)
local relation is based on the Sloan r-band, while our sizes are mea-
sured in the H160 band at a redshift of 1.39, which roughly corre-
sponds to the same rest-frame band. As a result, no size-correction
is required as the correction to r-band is negligible.
The H160 band sizes of the passive galaxies in this cluster
are on average ∼ 40% smaller than expected from the local re-
lation by Bernardi et al. (2012) with (cid:104)log(Re−circ/RBernardi)(cid:105) =
−0.21 (∼ 45% smaller for the spectroscopic conﬁrmed members,
(cid:104)log(Re−circ/RBernardi)(cid:105) = −0.25). There are also galaxies whose
sizes are ∼ 70% smaller than those of their local counterparts
(log(Re−circ/RBernardi) = −0.56). As one can see from Figure 10,
the most massive object in the cluster is the BCG, which also has
the largest size (∼ 24 kpc) and lies on the local relation. This is
consistent with ﬁndings from Stott et al. (2010, 2011), who showed
that as a population, BCGs have had very little evolution in mass or
size since z ∼ 1. Tiret et al. (2011) suggested that major mergers at
z (cid:62) 1.5 are required to explain the mass growth of these extremely

5.2 Stellar mass – light-weighted size relation

In this section we show the stellar mass – H160 light-weighted size
relation of the cluster XMMUJ2235-2557. The mass-size relation
of this cluster (in z850 band, rest-frame UV) has been studied in
previous literature (Strazzullo et al. 2010; Delaye et al. 2014).

In the top panel of Figure 10 we plot the mass – size re-
lation for the passive population in the cluster selected from red
sequence ﬁtting. Circled objects are spectroscopically conﬁrmed
cluster members (Grützbauch et al. 2012). The size we use from
this point onwards is the circularised effective radius (Re−circ), de-
ﬁned as:
Re−circ = ae ×√
where ae is the elliptical semi-major radius and q = b/a is the axis
ratio from the best-ﬁt GALFIT Sérsic proﬁle.

q

The integrated stellar masses are derived from the M∗/L -
colour relation and are scaled with the total GALFIT Sérsic magni-
tude (see Section 3.5 for details). We also plot the local mass-size
relation for the SDSS passive sample by Bernardi et al. (2012) for
comparison. We note that although this relation was derived for
galaxies regardless of their local density, a number of studies have
established that there is no obvious environmental dependence on
passive galaxy sizes in the local universe (Guo et al. 2009; Wein-
mann et al. 2009; Taylor et al. 2010; Huertas-Company et al. 2013;

massive passive galaxies. Hence below we exclude the BCG when
ﬁtting the mass-size relation. We ﬁt the mass-size relation with
a Bayesian inference approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC; Kelly 2007) with the following linear regression:
log(Re−circ/kpc) = α + β (log(M∗/M(cid:12))− 10.5) + N(0,ε)
where N(0,ε) is the normal distribution with mean 0 and dispersion
ε. The ε represents the intrinsic random scatter of the regression.

The best-ﬁt parameters (the intercept α, slope β and the scat-
ter ε) for both the entire red-sequence selected sample (A) and the
spectroscopically conﬁrmed members only (B) are summarised in
Table 2. For mass completeness and comparison to previous litera-
ture, we also ﬁt only the massive objects with log(M∗/M(cid:12)) (cid:62) 10.5,
the limiting mass adopted in Delaye et al. (2014) (C & D). We no-
tice that the slope of the relation can change by more than 1σ de-
pending on the considered mass range. We also ﬁt the slope using
the elliptical semi-major axis ae instead of Re−circ), which gives us
a signiﬁcantly ﬂatter slope (β = 0.35± 0.15).

Our measured slope is consistent at the 1σ level with the
results of Delaye et al. (2014), who studied the mass-size rela-
tion using seven clusters at 0.89 < z < 1.2 in the rest-frame B-
band (i.e. β = 0.49 ± 0.08 for log(M∗/M(cid:12)) > 10.5). Papovich
et al. (2012) measured the sizes of passive galaxies in a cluster at
z = 1.62 and found that ETG with masses log(M∗/M(cid:12)) > 10.48
have (cid:104)Re−circ(cid:105) = 2.0 kpc with the interquartile percentile range
(IQR) of 1.2− 3.3 kpc. Sizes in XMMUJ2235-2557 are on aver-
age 40% larger ((cid:104)Re−circ(cid:105) = 2.80 kpc, IQR = 1.45− 4.38 kpc).

While the ﬁts are consistent with each other on a 1σ level,
we notice that the relation in Delaye et al. (2014) for this cluster is
ﬂatter (β = 0.2± 0.3) compared to both our full sample ﬁt (A) and
massive sample ﬁt (C). This difference could be due to a combina-
tion of a) their mass-size relation is computed in the z-band while
ours is in H160, b) the two red sequence samples are selected differ-
ently and c) the masses computed here are scaled with total GAL-
FIT Sérsic magnitude instead of MAG_AUTO (the relation is slightly
ﬂatter: β = 0.38± 0.27 instead of 0.43 if we use the masses scaled
with MAG_AUTO).

A caveat of the above comparison is that we have not consid-
ered the effect of progenitor bias (van Dokkum & Franx 2001). Cor-
recting the progenitor bias (in age and morphology) has been shown
to reduce the magnitude of the observed size evolution (Saglia et al.
2010; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010a; Beiﬁori et al. 2014). Recently,
Jørgensen et al. (2014) corrected the progenitor bias by removing
galaxies that are too young in the Coma cluster to be the descen-
dants of a cluster at z = 1.27 and found no size evolution with red-
shift.

5.3 Colour gradients in the passive cluster galaxies
In Figure 11 we show the 1(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture colour, colour gradients
∇z850−H160 and log(M∗/L) gradients ∇log(M/L) of the passive sam-
ple as a function of stellar mass. The log(M∗/L) gradients are de-
rived from ﬁtting 1D M∗/L proﬁles, which are derived from 1D
colour proﬁles using the M∗/L-colour relation. Note that since the
M∗/L-colour relation is essentially a one-to-one mapping, measur-
ing the colour gradient is qualitatively equivalent to measuring the
log(M∗/L) gradient.
More massive galaxies appear to have a redder z850 −
H160 colour, as also shown by Strazzullo et al. (2010) with
HST/NICMOS data. Redder colour implies a higher median M∗/L
from the M∗/L-colour relation. The passive sample has a range of

linear ﬁt in the top panel for comparison. The BCG is indicated with the
black diamond. The cross shows the typical uncertainty of the sizes and the
median uncertainty of the integrated mass in our sample.

(∼ 42%) have very steep gradients with ∇z850−H160 <−0.5. The me-
dian colour gradient and 1σ scatter is (cid:104)∇z850−H160(cid:105) = −0.45± 0.43
(error on the median 0.09) and the median log(M∗/L) gradient
∇log(M/L) is −0.27± 0.25 (error on the median 0.05). This is con-
sistent with previous ﬁndings at higher redshift 1.3 < z < 2.5 (Guo
et al. 2011) which showed that passive galaxies have red cores and
bluer stellar population at the outskirts. We ﬁnd no strong depen-
dence of colour gradients with stellar mass, with a median Spear-
man’s rank correlation coefﬁcient of ρ (cid:39) 0.32, p (cid:39) 0.06 computed
using a bootstrapping method.

At redshift 1.39, the observed ∇z850−H160 colour gradient cor-
responds to rest-frame ∇U−R. To ensure rest-frame ∇U−R matches
∇z850−H160, we compute ∇U−R from the observed ∇z850−H160 and
z850 − H160 colour using simple stellar population models (SSPs)
of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) as a sanity check. The details of the
methodology are described in Section 6.3.1. We conﬁrm that the
median gradient (cid:104)∇U−R(cid:105) = −0.53 is comparable to ∇z850−H160.
We overplot the average local (U − R) colour gradient from
Wu et al. (2005) on Figure 11 (∇U−R = −0.21± 0.04) for compar-
ison. Wu et al. (2005) studied the colour gradients for a sample of
36 local ﬁeld early-type galaxies from SDSS and 2MASS. Due to
a lack of deep U-band imaging, the (U − R) colour gradient is not
available in most local galaxy surveys. In order to take into account
the average age difference between ﬁeld and cluster passive galax-
ies (e.g. Thomas et al. 2005, 2010), we evolve the gradients of Wu
et al. (2005) for an additional 2 Gyr with Bruzual & Charlot (2003)
SSP models (assuming an age gradient of −0.05 and a metallicity
gradient of −0.2 consistent with the literature (La Barbera et al.
2005; Wu et al. 2005)). The extrapolated value (∇U−R = −0.20) is
very close to the one for local ETGs. The average (U − R) colour
gradient at z ∼ 1.39 is found to be ∼ 2 times steeper than colour
gradients observed locally.
As a consistency check, we repeat the colour gradient mea-
surements in ∇Y105−H160 (∼ rest-frame g − r), and ﬁnd consistent
results with the U − R. We also compare them with the g− r colour
gradient in the SPIDER cluster sample and note that the g−r gradi-
ents at z ∼ 1.39 (median and 1σ scatter (cid:104)∇g−r(cid:105) = −0.16±−0.16)
are steeper than the local g − r gradients (−0.042 ± 0.144), al-
though with a smaller dynamic range. Details are described in Ap-
pendix E. Appendix E also explores the dependence of the local
g−r gradients on environment within the full SPIDER sample. We
report to later sections for a discussion on the origin of colour or
M∗/L gradient in these high redshift passive galaxies.

5.4 Comparison of light-weighted to mass-weighted

structural parameters

In Figure 12, we compare the light-weighted sizes (Re−circ)
measured in H160 band to the mass-weighted sizes (hereafter
Re−circ,mass) measured from the mass maps. The mass-weighted
sizes are ∼ 41% smaller than the H160 light-weighted sizes, with
a median difference of (cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ)(cid:105) = −0.23. The
scatter σlog(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ) is ∼ 0.11. In the most extreme case the
mass-weighted size can be up to ∼ 60% smaller than its light coun-
terpart (excluding the cluster BCG which is ∼ 65% smaller).

The general trend of mass-weighted sizes being smaller is in
qualitative agreement with the study at similar redshift by Szomoru
et al. (2013), who computed the mass-weighted sizes using radially

binned 1D surface brightness proﬁles for passive ﬁeld galaxies in
CANDELS. As we will show in the discussion, this is consistent
with the colour gradients in high redshift passive galaxies, in the
sense that they usually have redder cores and bluer outskirts (see
also, e.g. Saglia et al. 2000; Wuyts et al. 2010; Szomoru et al. 2011;
Guo et al. 2011). Negative colour gradients can lead to smaller
mass-weighted sizes compared to light-weighted sizes, as a higher
M∗/L ratio at the centre results in a more concentrated mass distri-
bution compared to the light distribution (hence, a smaller ae).

5.5 Stellar mass – mass-weighted size relation

In the bottom panel of Figure 10 we show the mass – size rela-
tion with the mass-weighted sizes. In the above section we have
demonstrated that the mass-weighted sizes are ∼41% smaller than
light-weighted sizes. Here we investigate how using mass-weighted
sizes can affect the mass – size relation.

can be seen from the intercept of the ﬁts. Apart from the intercept,
there seems to be a slight change in the slope of the relation if mass-
weighted sizes are used. The best-ﬁtted relation for the full sample
has a value β = 0.240, 34% lower than the light-weighted size –
mass relation, though the two relations are consistent within 1σ.

We check that the change of slope is not due to the discarded
objects. More statistics are required to conﬁrm if there is a shal-
lower mass dependence for mass-weighted sizes with respect to
light-weighted sizes.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Dependence of ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted

sizes on galaxy properties

In Section 5.4 we have shown that the mass-weighted sizes are
smaller than the corresponding light-weighted sizes and that the
majority of the galaxies have negative colour gradients steeper than
local passive galaxies. Intuitively, one might expect some corre-
lation between the ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted sizes
(log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ), hereafter the size ratio) on the physi-
cal parameters that are related to the underlying stellar population,
such as colour, stellar mass, and various structural parameters.

Hence, here we investigate the origin of the size ratio in our
cluster by examining the correlation with a number of integrated
properties. In Figure 13 we show the correlations between the size
ratio with the stellar mass, colour gradient ∇z850−H160, M∗/L gradi-
ent ∇log(M/L), z850 − H160 colour, light-weighted / mass-weighted
Sérsic indices, sizes, mean surface brightness Σ, mean surface mass
density Σmass and the mean surface mass density within a radius of

1 kpc Σ1. Recent works have shown that Σ1 is tightly correlated
with stellar mass and is closely related to quenching of star forma-
tion (Fang et al. 2013; van Dokkum et al. 2014; Barro et al. 2015).
All parameters plotted are given in Table F1. Running median and
1σ scatter are over-plotted in each panel.

We search for possible correlations with these physical pa-
rameters and compute the correlation coefﬁcients again using the
bootstrapping method. We see a mild dependence with the mass
surface density with a ρ value of −0.45, p (cid:39) 0.01. There is also
a weak dependence for the colour gradient and the M∗/L gradi-
ent, with ρ (cid:39) 0.32, p (cid:39) 0.07 and ρ (cid:39) 0.38, p (cid:39) 0.04. In addition,
we see a weak dependence with the mass-weighted size, which has
the highest ρ among the light-weighted and mass-weighted struc-
tural parameters. In Section 5.5, we suspect a difference in the mass
dependence for the mass-weighted sizes with respect to the light-
weighted sizes, which if genuine, implies a correlation between size
ratio and the stellar mass. Nevertheless, there is no signiﬁcant cor-
relation with mass. All other correlations have a |ρ| value < 0.3.
In summary, with the exception of mass surface density, most
of the parameters do not show signiﬁcant dependence with the size
ratio. That our measured mass-weighted sizes tend to be signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than light-weighted sizes can only happen because
there are gradients in mass-to-light ratio and colours, as seen pre-
viously. Therefore it is encouraging to see that there are (mildly
signiﬁcant) positive correlations between the ratio of sizes and the
gradients in colour and M∗/L. That the correlations are not perfect
illustrates the contributions of both uncertainties in the data and
method, and the fact that our Sérsic ﬁts are actually quite different
from a straightforward linear 1D ﬁt as used to derive the gradients.
A more sophisticated ﬁt to these parameters, and better correla-
tions, require higher S/N and / or a larger sample.

6.2 Evolution of the ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted

sizes to z ∼ 0

To investigate the evolution of the size ratio, we compare the
size ratio of the cluster sample with the local size ratio computed
from a sample of local passive galaxies in high-density environ-
ment selected from the SPIDER survey in Figure 14 (the SPI-
DER cluster sample, see Section 4 for details). We also compare
with the SPIDER sample for completeness. We binned the size
ratio of the SPIDER cluster sample (and the SPIDER sample) in
mass bins of 0.2, in the mass range 10.2 (cid:54) log(M∗/M(cid:12)) (cid:54) 11.6
(10.0 (cid:54) log(M∗/M(cid:12)) (cid:54) 11.6 for the SPIDER sample), to ensure
there are sufﬁcient numbers of local galaxies (> 50) in individual
bins.
We ﬁnd that the mass-weighed sizes in the SPIDER cluster
sample are on average ∼ 12% smaller than the r-band sizes with
a median (cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ)(cid:105) = −0.055 (∼13 % for the
SPIDER sample, (cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ)(cid:105) = −0.062), consistent
with previous result (Szomoru et al. 2013).

In addition, we ﬁnd that there is an intriguing offset between
the median size ratio of the cluster sample and the SPIDER cluster
sample, with a difference of (cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass,1.39/Re−circ,1.39) −
log(Re−circ,mass,0/Re−circ,0)(cid:105) = −0.18 (−0.17 for the SPIDER
sample).

A possible issue is the effect of recently quenched galaxies
on the size evolution, i.e. the progenitor bias. It has been shown to
have a non-negligible effect on inferred size evolution, and is able
to explain part if not all of the observed size evolution (e.g. Saglia
et al. 2010; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010b; Carollo et al. 2013; Poggianti
et al. 2013; Jørgensen et al. 2014; Belli, Newman & Ellis 2015;

Keating et al. 2015). The effect on the evolution of the size ratio
is however unclear, as the newly quenched galaxies may have a
range of M∗/L gradients that depends on the quenching mechanism
involved.

Using age measurements from La Barbera et al. (2010a), we
try to correct the progenitor bias in the size ratio of the SPI-
DER cluster sample. An age cut is applied to the SPIDER clus-
ter sample to remove galaxies that are younger than 8.98 Gyr,
the time duration from z ∼ 1.39 to z ∼ 0. The result is shown
as a light brown line and wheat band in Figure 14 in the mass
range 10.2 (cid:54) log(M∗/M(cid:12)) (cid:54) 11.6. Although some changes can be
seen, the size ratios of the progenitor bias corrected sample are in
general consistent with the SPIDER cluster sample, with median
(cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ)(cid:105) = −0.065. The median logarithmic size
ratios in each bin between the two are within ±0.05. The offset be-
tween the median size ratio of the cluster sample and the progenitor
bias corrected SPIDER cluster sample is −0.16. Hence, the progen-
itor bias alone does not explain the observed offset.

The smaller size ratio at z ∼ 1.39 suggests that the M∗/L gra-
dient is larger (i.e. steeper) in these high redshift passive cluster
galaxies compared to the local ones. This implies an evolution of

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

M∗/L gradient with redshift, consistent with our ﬁnding that the
colour gradient at high redshift cluster passive galaxies is much
steeper than the local ones. In the next section, we try to explore
the origin of the colour (and M∗/L) gradient and the physical pro-
cesses for the evolution of these passive galaxies.

6.3 Origin and evolution of colour gradients with redshift

In Section 5.3 we have shown that the median colour gradient in
our sample is ∼ 2 times steeper than the measured local (U − R)
gradient ∇U−R from Wu et al. (2005).

The origin of the colour gradients is directly related to how
the stellar population in galaxies assembled and evolved. It is how-
ever challenging to segregate the impact of age or metallicity us-
ing a small sample of galaxies due to degeneracies between colour,
age and metallicity. In previous studies, colour gradients are mostly
interpreted as either age gradients (∇age = d log(age)/d log(a)) at
ﬁxed metallicity or metallicity gradients (∇Z = d log(Z)/d log(a))
at ﬁxed age. Some works in clusters at z ∼ 0.4 (Saglia et al. 2000)
and local clusters (e.g. Tamura & Ohta 2003) showed however that
the colour gradients may be preferentially produced by radial varia-

tion in metallicity rather than age. The age gradients in local passive
galaxies are consistent with 0 (or slightly positive), while the aver-
age metallicity gradient is found to be of ∇Z ≈ −0.1 to −0.3 (see
also Mehlert et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2005; La Barbera & de Carvalho
2009). This result is also supported by recent studies with integral
ﬁeld spectroscopy (e.g Kuntschner et al. 2010; González Delgado
et al. 2014; Oliva-Altamirano et al. 2015; Wilkinson et al. 2015).
Our (U − R) and (g− r) colour gradient measurements alone
unfortunately do not allow us to break the age-metallicity degener-
acy. Nevertheless, with additional colour information at z ∼ 0, by
studying the evolution of the colour gradient with redshift we can
shed light on the origin of the colour gradients in our sample of
early type galaxies in clusters.

6.3.1 Methodology

We investigate quantitatively the evolution of colour gradients by
modeling them in our cluster sample under different assumptions
of the radial variation of stellar population properties. Simply put,
we would like to evolve the observed z850 − H160 colour gradients
∇z850−H160 in the cluster sample to see under which conditions in
age and metallicity gradient will they match the observed (U − R)
gradient at z ∼ 0.

For simplicity, here we assume the stellar populations in the
passive galaxies are coeval and chemically homogeneous in the
regions we considered, hence they can be described by simple
stellar populations (SSP) models. We use the models of Bruzual
& Charlot (2003) (hereafter BC03) and adopt a Chabrier IMF.
The BC03 distribution provides SSP models with metallicities
Z = [0.0001,0.0004,0.004,0.008,0.02,0.05] from t = 0 to the age
of the Universe in unequally spaced time steps. The results below

Figure 15. Rest-frame U − R colour of stellar populations with differ-
ent ages and metallicities. Left panel: U − R colour-age relations. The
black line shows the stellar populations with solar metallicity (Z =
0.02). The red lines show populations with different metallicities (Z =
0.0001,0.0004,0.004,0.008,0.05) as indicated. The grey dotted line shows
the current age of the Universe (13.45 Gyr) with our choice of cosmology
and the grey dashed line shows the age of Universe at redshift 1.39 (4.465
Gyr). Right panel: U −R colour-metallicity relations. The black lines shows
populations with different ages (in Gyr) as indicated.

do not strongly dependent on the choice of IMF, since the U − R
broad band optical colours under different IMFs (e.g. Chabrier
vs. Salpeter) are in reasonable agreement with each other. In Ap-
pendix D we show that adopting exponentially declining τ-models
for this analysis (instead of SSPs), does not change the results.
We compute the rest-frame U − R colour for individual SSP
models with different ages and metallicities by convolving the
model SEDs with the U and R ﬁlters. The colours are then inter-
polated with a cubic spline to obtain an equally spaced colour grid
in age and metallicity. Figure 15 shows the U − R colour at differ-
ent ages (left, i.e. the colour-age relations) and metallicities (right,
i.e. the colour-metallicity relations) as an example. Using the same
method, we compute a z850 − H160 colour grid by redshifting the
SSP models to z = 1.39.
Similar to Section 5.3, we have also repeated the above analy-
sis using the g− r colour gradients and ﬁnd results which are com-
pletely consistent (Appendix E). Since the g − r colour has less
dynamic range in the evolution, in the following we will mainly
discuss the result of the U − R colour gradients.

To simplify the modeling process, we analyse the evolution
of colour at two radii, 0.5ae and 2ae, representing the inner re-
gion and outer region of the galaxy respectively. In similar stud-
ies (e.g. Saglia et al. 2000) more central regions are used instead
(0.1− 0.2Re), but this is not possible at this redshift due to limited
resolution. Nevertheless, our choice of radial range is sufﬁcient for
the purpose as the colour gradients are well-ﬁtted by a linear rela-
tion in logarithmic radius (see Figure 5).

Because of the age-metallicity degeneracy, we consider sev-
eral scenarios with additional assumptions in the age or metallicity
gradients. In this study we explore three possibilities (cases) to in-
terpret the colour gradient evolution:

• Case I - Pure age-driven gradient evolution – In this case we
explore the possibility of using a single age gradient to interpret the
evolution of colour gradients. The inner and outer regions are as-
sumed to have identical metallicities (i.e. ﬂat metallicity gradients

Assuming a certain metallicity for the inner regions (and
equivalently the outer regions), we derive ages of the stellar pop-
ulation of the inner and outer regions in each galaxy respectively
through matching the observed z850 − H160 colours to the derived
z850 − H160 SSP colours.
• Case II - Pure metallicity-driven gradient evolution – In
this case we assume that the stellar population in the inner and
outer region are coeval (i.e. ﬂat age gradients ∇age = 0). Assum-
ing a certain metallicity for the inner regions, we derive the inner
ages in each galaxy using the same method as I. The same age is
then applied to the outer regions. With ages and z850−H160 colours,
metallicities in the outer regions are then derived using the colour-
metallicity relations.
• Case III - Age-driven gradient evolution with an assumed
metallicity gradient – Same as case I, but assume a ﬁxed metallic-
ity gradient with ∇Z = −0.2, which is the mean value observed in
local passive galaxies (e.g. Tamura & Ohta 2003; Wu et al. 2005;
Brough et al. 2007; Reda et al. 2007) as well as in recent simu-
lations (e.g. Hirschmann et al. 2015). Again assuming a certain
metallicity for the inner regions, we derive the inner ages from
the z850 − H160 colour. The metallicity in the outer regions is then
computed according to the assumed gradient; outer ages are then
derived with the computed metallicity.

In summary, in each case we obtain the ages and metallicities
in the inner and outer region of each cluster galaxy. We then evolve
the corresponding SSPs in both regions to z = 0, and compute the
corresponding local (U −R) colour gradients. We also compute the
rest-frame (U − R) gradient for the high-redshift sample for com-
parison. For each of the three cases above, we test three scenar-
ios with different assumed metallicity for the inner regions, sub-
solar, solar and super-solar (Z = 0.008,0.02,0.05 or equivalently
[Fe/H] = −0.33,0.09,0.56) (Bruzual & Charlot 2003). Assuming
metallicities with Z < 0.008 or Z > 0.05 is unphysical for most
galaxies in the cluster sample.

Under different assumed metallicity for the inner region, oc-
casionally the age (or metallicity for case II) determination for
some galaxies results in an unphysical age (or metallicity). With
our choice of cosmological parameters, the age of universe at
z = 1.39 is 4.465 Gyr. Deduced ages that are too old (> 4.465
Gyr for z = 1.39 or > 13.45 Gyr for z = 0 within 1σ uncertainty)
are rejected to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. Galaxies that
are rejected may simply be unphysical to be modelled with par-
ticular metallicity (see, for example in Figure 15, a galaxy with
U − R > 2.15 at z = 1.39 will result in an unphysical age if one
assumes Z = 0.008) or have a more complicated star formation his-
tory, which cannot be well-represented by SSPs.

6.3.2 Case I – Pure age-driven gradient evolution

In the top panel of Figure 16, we show the evolution of the rest-
frame (U − R) colour gradient from z = 1.39 to z = 0 under the
assumption of pure age gradient. We show the scenario with as-
sumed solar metallicity (Z = 0.02) in the inner region. We ﬁnd
that although the gradients evolve in the correct direction, the me-
dian gradient of the evolved sample is too shallow. The result is
almost identical if we assume sub-solar or super-solar metallicity
for the inner region instead, with median evolved colour gradient of
(Z,∇U−R) = (0.008,−0.036), (0.02,−0.034), (0.05,−0.037). Un-
der the assumption of sub-solar metallicity, 19 out of 36 galaxies
have a physical age. On the other hand, most of the galaxies are
retained if we assume a solar (33 out of 36) or super-solar metal-

licity (36 out of 36). We conclude that in the reasonable range of
metallicity that we covered, a pure age-driven gradient is not able
to match the observed evolution of colour gradient.

The reason behind the rapid evolution is the ﬂattening of
the SSP colour-age relation over time. Since we assume identical
metallicities for both inner and outer regions, the inner and outer
region of an individual galaxy lie on the same colour-age relation
in Figure 15. Take the solar metallicity Z = 0.02 case (black solid
line) as an example, the U − R colour increases sharply from 0 to 4
Gyr but ﬂattens after, hence the (U − R) gradient evolves to almost
zero at redshift 0.

6.3.3 Case II – Pure metallicity-driven gradient evolution

Instead of using a ﬂat metallicity gradient as case I, the middle
panel of Figure 16 shows the evolution of the (U − R) gradient
under the assumption of pure metallicity-driven gradient, or in
other words, a ﬂat age gradient ∇age = 0. Again, we show the sce-
nario with assumed solar metallicity (Z = 0.02) in the inner re-
gion. Similar to case I, galaxies that have unphysical ages / metal-
licities are discarded. 21, 33 and 31 out of 36 galaxies are re-
tained in each metallicity scenario (Z = 0.008,0.02,0.05) respec-
tively. From Figure 16, we can see that the median gradient of
the evolved sample is even steeper compared to the one at red-
shift 1.39. Hence, it is clear that a pure metallicity-driven gradi-
ent fails to reproduce the observed gradient. The median gradi-
ents of the evolved sample in the three metallicity scenarios are
(Z,∇U−R) = (0.008,−0.691), (0.02,−0.920), (0.05,−0.900).

The evolution can be explained using the colour-metallicity re-
lations in the right panel of Figure 15. As the population ages, the
U −R colour-metallicity relation steepens (for example, from 2 Gyr
to 4 Gyr), which causes the colour gradient to become more nega-
tive. The steepening stops at around ∼ 4 Gyr, thus the colour gra-
dient after then remains unchanged. For the solar metallicity sce-
nario, the median metallicity gradient and 1σ scatter we found is
(cid:104)∇Z(cid:105) ∼ −1.32±1.22 at z = 1.39, much higher than that observed in
local galaxies. Of course in reality metallicity in individual galax-
ies differs, but mixing galaxies with different metallicity within our
metallicity range would not change this conclusion.

6.3.4 Case III – Age-driven gradient evolution with assumed

metallicity gradient

The bottom panel of Figure 16 shows the evolution of the (U − R)
gradient with a metallicity gradient as observed in local passive
galaxies: ∇Z = −0.2. Similar to case I, galaxies with unphysi-
cal ages in the inner or outer regions are rejected. 19, 33 and 36
out of 36 galaxies are retained in each metallicity scenario re-
spectively. The solar metallicity scenario works reasonably well
for the majority of the sample with evolved median gradient of
(Z,∇U−R) = (0.02,−0.198), which is in close agreement with the
observed value in the local universe by Wu et al. (2005). De-
spite a number of objects have to be discarded due to unphysical
age, the median gradient as well as the individual gradients of the
evolved samples in the sub-solar metallicity scenario (Z,∇U−R) =
(0.008,−0.180) is also close to but slightly smaller than the ob-
served local value. Assuming super-solar metallicity for the inner
regions on the other hand, predicts gradients that are slightly too
steep (Z,∇U−R) = (0.05,−0.232).

Besides the median values, the scatter in the evolved colour
gradients is also in excellent agreement to the local value by Wu
et al. (2005) (∇U−R = −0.21 ± 0.04). For example, for the solar
metallicity scenario the scatter reduces from 0.37 at z ∼ 1.39 to
0.06 at z = 0.

6.3.5

Implications and limitations

From the above case study, we ﬁnd that the presence of an age gra-
dient is a necessary condition for the evolution of the colour gra-
dient, and with metallicity gradient they can sufﬁciently reproduce
the magnitude of the evolution of the colour gradient from z = 1.39
to z = 0.

An age-driven gradient evolution with a metallicity gradient
close to the local value is the most probable scenario, as it can

well-reproduce the observed evolution of the colour gradients over
redshift in both median and scatter. Below we try to understand
why this is the case. Among the three metallicity scenarios, the one
with solar metallicity seems to best match the evolution of colour
gradients for most galaxies. In this scenario we ﬁnd a median age
gradient and 1σ scatter of (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) = −0.33± 0.37 at z = 1.39 (i.e.
a median age difference ∼ 1.4 Gyr between the inner and outer
regions).

Figure 17 shows the evolution of the colour gradient in this
case (case III), assuming a formation redshift of the inner regions of
z f orm = 3.0 and an age gradient of (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) = −0.33 at z = 1.39. The
top left panel shows the change in the evolution for different for-
mation redshifts z f orm = 2.0,4.0,5.0, selected to be consistent with
ﬁndings in recent spectroscopic studies at similar redshift (Gargiulo
et al. 2012; Belli, Newman & Ellis 2015). The net evolution from
z ∼ 1.39 to z ∼ 0 is clearly insensitive to the formation redshift.
On the other hand, the path of evolution depends largely on the age
gradient; from the top right panel we show that with different ini-
tial age gradient at z = 1.39, a large range of colour gradients at
z = 1.39 can reach similar value at z ∼ 0. In other words, if the
colour gradients in high redshift passive galaxies are mainly due to
radial variation in age, this assumption would be able to match the
evolution of colour gradient for most galaxies.

This is in agreement with Gargiulo et al. (2012), who inves-
tigated the origin of the colour gradient on a sample of early-type
galaxies at 0 < z < 1.9 with spatially resolved colour and global
SED ﬁtting. They found that the colour gradients of ∼ 50% of their
sample can be reproduced with pure age gradients, while invoking
pure metallicity gradients can only explain a small subset of their
sample. In addition, extremely steep metallicity gradients are re-
quired that are only marginally comparable with those observed in
the local Universe. A similar recent study by De Propris, Bremer
& Phillipps (2015) studied the ratio of galaxy sizes in two bands
(as a proxy of the colour gradient) in red sequence galaxies in four
clusters with < z >∼ 1.25 (including this cluster) also found an in-
dication of negative colour gradients, which they also attribute to
due to the presence of age gradients.

Our result is also not inconsistent with studies on local and
intermediate redshift passive galaxies which suggest colour gra-
dients are mainly due to metallicity gradients (e.g. Saglia et al.
2000; Tamura & Ohta 2003). For example, Kuntschner et al. (2010)
found a mean ∇Z = −0.25±0.11 and mean ∇age = 0.02±0.13 for
galaxies with age > 8 Gyr. Nevertheless, the age gradient (or its
presence) is very difﬁcult to constrain in local passive galaxies. As
Gargiulo et al. (2012) pointed out, the effect of the age difference
in the inner and outer regions is much more enhanced when the
stellar population is young (i.e. at high redshift). Indeed, the age
gradient ﬂattens quickly over redshift. For example, with a median
age gradient of (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) = −0.33± 0.37 at z = 1.39 (from our best
scenario); assuming passive evolution this corresponds to a median
age gradient of (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) = −0.05±0.06 at z = 0, which is consistent
with a ﬂat age gradient.

Given the assumption that the cluster passive galaxies at z =
1.39 have the same metallicity gradient as the local ones, it is im-
plied that the evolution of colour gradients from z ∼ 1.4 to 0 can be
explained simply through passive evolution. This is consistent with
luminosity function studies in clusters (e.g. Andreon 2008; De Pro-
pris, Phillipps & Bremer 2013).

to the median z850 − H160 gradient of our sample at redshift 1.39, and the observed (U − R) gradient at redshift 0 by Wu et al. (2005). The error bars show the
uncertainty of the median.

6.3.6 Physical processes responsible for the evolution of size and

colour gradient

While passive evolution is a very tempting conclusion, it alone can-
not explain the observed size evolution in clusters over redshift.
In Figure 10 we have shown that the cluster passive galaxies are
∼ 40% smaller than their local counterparts. Similarly, a large num-
ber of previous studies have conﬁrmed that the sizes of passive
galaxies in high redshift clusters are smaller than those in the local
Universe (e.g. Rettura et al. 2010; Strazzullo et al. 2010; Papovich
et al. 2012; Strazzullo et al. 2013), although a part of this size evo-
lution (e.g. Saglia et al. 2000) or even all (Jørgensen et al. 2014)
may be due to progenitor bias. If we assume this observed size evo-
lution is genuine, in the sense that it is not completely an effect of
progenitor bias, additional physical processes must be in place over
redshift to increase the size of the population but not signiﬁcantly
their stellar mass, and at the same time cannot severely disrupt the
existing stellar population gradients.

The “pufﬁng-up” scenario (or adiabatic expansion) is one of
the candidates to explain the size evolution of passive galaxies (Fan
et al. 2008, 2010). While it may work for increasing the size, it is
yet unclear whether it can sufﬁciently explain the observed evo-
lution of colour gradients. Further detailed investigation with an
accurate model is required to test this scenario, but current models
(e.g. Fan et al. 2008) are much simpliﬁed.

Minor mergers, on the other hand, seem to be a viable sce-

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

nario as the effects are primarily on the outer part of the galax-
ies. Hilz, Naab & Ostriker (2013) showed from n-body/SPH sim-
ulations that for minor (with a mass ratio 1:10) or intermediate
(1:5) dry mergers, the inner region of the galaxy remains almost
unchanged and the accreted mass assembles predominately in the
outer part of the galaxy. This is also seen in the cosmological sim-
ulations of Rodriguez-Gomez et al. (2015) where the accreted stars
from mergers with lower mass ratio (i.e. merging with smaller
galaxies) dominate at outer radius. Hence, the inner stellar pop-
ulations of the galaxy can age through passive evolution without
major disturbance. The negative age gradients we ﬁnd here seem to
be consistent with this picture given that the minor mergers are dry
and the stars accreted are relatively young.

The minor merger scenario has been known to be a viable
mechanism in the ﬁeld. It is consistent with the observed inside-out
growth as seen from the evolution of the stellar mass surface den-
sity proﬁles of passive ﬁeld galaxies over redshift (e.g. van Dokkum
et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2013). Nevertheless, traditionally this type
of merger activity is believed to be suppressed in virialized clus-
ters because of the high velocity dispersion, resulting in high rel-
ative velocities between cluster members (e.g. Conroy, Wechsler
& Kravtsov 2007; Lotz et al. 2013). The exception being mergers
of satellite galaxies onto the BCG due to dynamical friction (e.g
Burke & Collins 2013; Burke, Hilton & Collins 2015), which con-
tribute to the mass growth of BCG and the intracluster light (ICL).

On the other hand, merger events are thought to be very common in
galaxy groups where the velocity dispersion is lower, or when the
cluster is still assembling. Recent works have found that sizes of
massive passive galaxies are larger in clusters compared to the ﬁeld
at high redshift (e.g. Cooper et al. 2012; Zirm, Toft & Tanaka 2012;
Papovich et al. 2012; Lani et al. 2013; Strazzullo et al. 2013; Jør-
gensen & Chiboucas 2013; Delaye et al. 2014), but not in the local
Universe (e.g. Huertas-Company et al. 2013; Cappellari 2013), sug-
gesting an accelerated size evolution in high density environments.
This accelerated size evolution is probably due to an enhanced rate
of mergers during infall of groups, when the cluster is being assem-
bled (Lotz et al. 2013; Delaye et al. 2014; Newman et al. 2014).
While this explains the elevated sizes in cluster compared to the
ﬁeld at ﬁxed redshift, it does not provide an explanation to the sub-
sequent size evolution observed in clusters over redshift z < 1.5.

Despite the suppression of galaxy merging activity in clus-
ters based on relative velocity arguments, it is clear that clusters
themselves and their associated dark matter halos continue to grow
by accreting galaxy groups. It is possible that some accretion can
still happen to the cluster galaxy population during infall of these
group-scale structures. Simulations of mergers with cluster mass
halos have shown that the accreted mass resides mainly in the satel-
lite galaxies and the ICL, but only mildly in the BCG (e.g. White
et al. 2007; Brown et al. 2008). Recent simulations also demon-
strate that the size of clusters members can grow signiﬁcantly via
major and minor mergers and the frequency of mergers is sufﬁcient
to explain the observed size growth in clusters since z ∼ 2 (La-
porte et al. 2013). In addition, the observed merger rate in the clus-
ter galaxy population, excluding the BCG, is poorly constrained. If
this is possible, this kind of gradual mass growth is able to explain
at the same time the evolution of both size and colour gradient in
clusters.

If we take the size evolution into account and assume the mass
growth takes place predominately at the outskirts, the stellar pop-
ulation we considered here in the colour gradient (a < 3.5ae) will
correspond to the central population at R < 1.5− 2Re−circ in local
cluster galaxies. If the evolution is primarily merger or accretion
driven as we suggest above, one would expect that the outer stellar
population depends on past merger activity.

Interestingly, there has been some evidence indicating changes
in stellar population properties at the outer region of local massive
passive cluster galaxies (e.g. NGC 4889 in Coma cluster Coccato,
Gerhard & Arnaboldi 2010) as well as in ﬁeld ellipticals (e.g. Pu
et al. 2010). More recent studies have extended the age and metal-
licity measurements to large radii (∼ 8− 10Re, for example in La
Barbera et al. 2012) and revealed that the outer age or metallicity
gradients at (cid:38) 1− 2Re are distinct from those in the inner region
(e.g. Greene et al. 2013; Pastorello et al. 2014; Raskutti, Greene &
Murphy 2014). These changes in stellar population gradients are
commonly interpreted to be result of mergers. Nevertheless, these
changes can also come from recent quenched galaxies that under-
went minor mergers before infalling to the cluster. A progenitor
biased corrected sample is needed to address this issue.

6.3.7 Monolithic collapse model

Traditional monolithic models predict very high metallicity gradi-
ents in passive galaxies, around ∇Z ∼ −0.5, and a ﬂat if not slightly
positive age gradients (e.g. Larson 1974; Carlberg 1984). The fact
that we ﬁnd that on average a negative age gradient is necessary
to explain the evolution of the colour gradient is hence inconsis-
tent with the monolithic collapse scenario. This conclusion is in-

dependent of the metallicity gradient we assumed; in case III we
assume the metallicity gradient to be ∇Z = −0.2 as observed in lo-
cal passive galaxies, but using a steeper metallicity gradient would
not work. The bottom two panels in Figure 17 show the effect of
assuming a metallicity gradient ∇Z = −0.5 as predicted by tradi-
tional monolithic models. While the U − R colour gradient at red-
shift 1.39 is in reasonable agreement with the observed value, the
evolved gradient is too steep (i.e. insufﬁcient evolution) compared
to the observed value at redshift 0.
We also compare our observed z850 − H160 colour gradients
at redshift 1.39 with recent simulations based on a revised ver-
sion of the monolithic model by Pipino, D’Ercole & Matteucci
(2008); Pipino et al. (2010). With semi-cosmological initial con-
ditions, they are able to match the age gradients and metallicity
gradients observed in local passive galaxies. Tortora et al. (2013)
computed the colour gradients from the Pipino et al. (2010) simu-
lations using BC03 SSP models, for which we can directly use for
the comparison. Among the four models presented in their work
(E1, E2, E3, E4), we ﬁnd that our observed median colour gradient
seems to be in reasonable agreement with models that predict steep
metallicity gradient (E2, ∇Z ∼ −0.35 and E4, ∇Z ∼ −0.45) and
nearly ﬂat age gradient at z = 0. The comparison with the colour
gradients in Gargiulo, Saracco & Longhetti (2011); Gargiulo et al.
(2012) at redshift 1 < z < 2 also gives a similar result. However, the
local colour gradient at z ∼ 0, as well as the F606W −F850LP gra-
dients of high-redshift galaxies in Gargiulo, Saracco & Longhetti
(2011) favours the other two models (E1, E3) instead, so there is
not a single model that can explain the evolution of colour gradi-
ents. Hence, our result cannot be reproduced by the revised mono-
lithic collapse model.

6.3.8 Effect of dust obscuration

A complication that we have not considered above is the effect of
dust obscuration. The colour gradient can be affected by the radial
variation of dust content. For local passive galaxies, Wise & Silva
(1996) pointed out that their colour gradients can be reproduced by
a dust gradient, albeit with much higher dust masses than observed
(Saglia et al. 2000). Hence the colour gradient in these galaxies
should be driven from the variation of the stellar population. Nev-
ertheless, the amount of dust can vary with radius; it is not uncom-
mon to ﬁnd dust at the centre, for example in Lauer et al. (2005),
central dust is visible in almost half of the local passive sample.

At high redshift, measuring the radial variation of dust content
is even more difﬁcult due to the compact nature of passive galax-
ies and limited angular resolution. Several studies suggest that al-
though the effect of dust cannot be completely neglected, it plays
only a minor role in driving colour gradients. Belli, Newman &
Ellis (2015) showed that their early-type sample at 1.0 < z < 1.6
have little to no dust extinction (see also Mendel et al. 2015). For
the radial variation of dust, Guo et al. (2011) demonstrated from
spatially resolved annular SED ﬁtting that, for their sample of six
z ∼ 2 galaxies dust partly contributes to the observed colour gradi-
ents, the inferred dust gradient and global extinction have a value of
dE(B−V )/d log(R) ∼ −0.07 and (cid:104)E(B−V )(cid:105) ∼ 0.1. On the other
hand, among the 11 early-type galaxies at 1.0 < z < 1.9 in Gargiulo
et al. (2012), half of the sample have no dust extinction (i.e. AV = 0)
from global SED ﬁt and for most galaxies the main driver of the
colour gradients is certainly not the radial variation of dust.

It is not possible to derive reliable dust gradients from our
multi-band photometry data. Hence, for completeness we test
whether the effect of dust would affect our conclusion. Assuming

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

dust mainly affects the central region as in local passive galax-
ies, we deredden the z850 − H160 colour in the inner region by
a certain magnitude but leaving the outer part unchanged to re-
duce the observed gradient, then recompute all the evolution un-
der different assumptions. We ﬁnd that on average a decrease of
0.14 mag in the z850 − H160 colour at the inner region (∼ 0.25
mag at 0.1ae) will remove the observed evolution, i.e. the differ-
ence of the observed median colour gradient at z = 1.39 with local
passive galaxies. Assuming the extinction curve by Calzetti et al.
(2000), this corresponds to a gradient of dAV /d log(a) ∼ −0.40 or
dE(B−V )/d log(a)∼−0.10. Hence, our conclusion is robust if the
dust gradient is less steep than this value. If the genuine colour gra-
dient is shallower at z = 1.39, the evolution will be best explained
with a shallower age gradient (as seen from the top right panel of
Figure 17), and will not change any of our conclusions. Neverthe-
less, although unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
observed colour gradients are driven by a large amount of dust lo-
cated in the central region.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented the structural parameters, resolved stellar mass
distribution and colour gradient of a sample of 36 passive galax-
ies in the red sequence of the cluster XMMUJ2235-2557 at red-
shift z ∼ 1.39. With HST/ACS and WFC3 data we derive light-
weighted structural parameters independently in ﬁve different
bands (i775,z850,Y105,J125,H160) through 2D Sérsic ﬁtting. We
compute 1D z850 − H160 colour proﬁles for individual galaxies and
ﬁt logarithmic gradients ∇z850−H160 in the range of PSF HWHM
< a < 3.5ae to derive colour gradients. In addition, we derive re-
solved stellar mass surface density maps for individual galaxies
with an empirical M∗/L-colour relation and the z850 and H160 im-
ages. Mass-weighted structural parameters are derived from the re-
solved stellar mass surface density map. We ﬁnd the following:

– From our multi-band light-weighted structural parameter mea-
surements, the passive galaxies in this cluster show a reduc-
tion of ∼ 20% in sizes from i775 to H160, consistent with the
wavelength-dependence found in local passive galaxies.
– The H160 band sizes in this cluster are on average ∼ 40%
smaller than that expected from the local mass-size relation by
Bernardi et al. (2012) at the same rest-wavelength, with a me-
dian of (cid:104)log(Re−circ/RBernardi)(cid:105) = −0.21. In the extreme cases
the galaxies can be ∼ 70% smaller than their local counterparts.
the galaxies are ∼ 41%
– The mass-weighted sizes of
smaller than their own light-weighted sizes, with a median
(cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass/Re−circ)(cid:105) = −0.23, in the extreme cases the
mass-weighted sizes can be up to ∼ 60% smaller.
– 78% of the galaxies in our sample show a negative colour gradi-
ent ∇z850−H160, with redder colours at the core and bluer colour in
the outskirts. 42% have steep gradients with ∇z850−H160 < −0.5.
The median colour gradient is (cid:104)∇z850−H160(cid:105) = −0.45, two times
steeper than the colour gradient found in local passive galaxies
in previous studies.
– The ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted size does not
show any signiﬁcant correlation to galaxy properties, and is only
mildly correlated to M∗/L gradient, mass surface density and
mass-weighted size. The mild correlation with M∗/L gradients
supports our ﬁndings about smaller mass-weighted sizes com-
pared to light-weighted sizes.
– By using the local SPIDER sample we ﬁnd that the mass-
weighted sizes are on average ∼ 13% smaller than the rest

frame r-band light-weighted sizes, consistent with previous
studies. Comparing the cluster sample to the local SPIDER
cluster sample, we ﬁnd an offset
in the ratio of mass-
weighted sizes to the H160 band light-weighted sizes with
a median difference of (cid:104)log(Re−circ,mass,1.39/Re−circ,1.39) −
log(Re−circ,mass,0/Re−circ,0)(cid:105) = −0.18, which we attribute to an
evolution of the M∗/L gradient over redshift. We also ﬁnd that
the progenitor bias cannot explain this observed offset. This also
seems to be consistent with the steeper colour gradient we ﬁnd
in the cluster galaxies compared to those seen in local passive
galaxies.

We then investigate the origin and the evolution of the ob-
served colour gradient by modeling the colour gradients with SSPs
under three different assumptions. We analyse the evolution of the
rest-frame (U-R) colour gradient at two radii, 0.5ae and 2ae, rep-
resenting the inner and outer region of the galaxy respectively. We
subdivide each of the assumptions summarised below into three
different metallicity scenarios: we ﬁx the metallicity of the inner
regions to sub-solar, solar and super-solar Z = (0.008,0.02,0.05):

– Case I - Pure age-driven gradient evolution – Evolution of
colour gradients is solely due to age gradient. The inner and
outer regions of the passive galaxies are assumed to have identi-
cal metallicities (i.e. ﬂat metallicity gradients ∇Z = 0). We ﬁnd
that although an age gradient alone is sufﬁcient to reproduce all
the evolution in the colour gradient, it over-predicts the evolu-
tion over redshift, causing the evolved local gradients to be too
shallow compared to the observation.
– Case II - Pure metallicity-driven gradient evolution – Evo-
lution of colour gradients is solely due to metallicity gradient.
We assume the inner and outer regions have identical ages (i.e.
ﬂat age gradients ∇age = 0). A metallicity gradient alone cannot
explain the observation as the evolution it predicts goes into the
wrong direction.
– Case III - Age-driven gradient evolution with an assumed
metallicity gradient – Evolution of colour gradients is due to a
combination of age and metallicity gradients. The galaxies are
assumed to have a ﬁxed metallicity gradient identical to that ob-
served in local passive galaxies, ∇Z (cid:39) −0.2. This model works
well, the solar metallicity scenario can well reproduce the ob-
served evolution of the colour gradients from z ∼ 1.39 to z ∼ 0.
– We show that the above ﬁndings are still robust if any central
dust reddening at 0.5ae is (cid:46) 0.14 mag, or equivalently an ex-
tinction gradient dAV /d log(a) ∼ 0.40 or dE(B−V )/d log(a) ∼
−0.10.

Our case study indicates that the presence of an age gradient at
high redshift is a necessary condition to explain the observed evo-
lution of the colour gradients, while metallicity gradients probably
dominate at z ∼ 0. We also repeat the study using the rest-frame
g− r colour gradient and obtain completely consistent results. This
conclusion is partially consistent with other studies (Saglia et al.
2000; Guo et al. 2011; Gargiulo et al. 2012). For the best-matching
scenario (Case III with solar metallicity), the median age gradient
of our cluster sample is (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) ∼ −0.33± 0.37, while the metallic-
ity gradient we assumed is ∇Z (cid:39) −0.2. Given the assumption that
passive galaxies at z = 1.39 have the same metallicity gradient as
the local ones, the evolution of colour gradients from z ∼ 1.4 to
z ∼ 0 can be explained by passive evolution.

This general picture is also consistent with a more gradual
mass growth mechanism such as via minor mergers, in the sense

that the inner region of the galaxies remains undisturbed and the
accreted younger material settles at the outskirts.

APPENDIX A: DETAILS OF THE SIMULATIONS

We perform extensive simulations with a set of 50000 simulated
galaxies with surface brightness proﬁles described by a Se´rsic
proﬁle on the ACS z850 and WFC3 H160 band images to give a
more realistic estimate of the uncertainty of the photometry, light-
weighted structural parameters and mass-weighted structural pa-
rameters. Here we describe the set-up and the procedures involved
in these simulations.

A1 Constructing the set of simulated galaxies

range of 0.4 < z850 − H160 < 2.2 (hence a range of z850 magni-
tudes 19.4 < z850 < 27.2). This selected magnitude range is a good
representation of the cluster sample, and is also the range where
our M∗/L - colour relation is calibrated as we explained in Sec-
tion 3.4. Each galaxy is described by a Sérsic proﬁle with input
structural parameters randomly drawn from Gaussian distributions
with means and dispersions taken from the real galaxies distribu-
tions in the H160 band.

The input structural parameters are identical in the two bands.
The means and dispersions of the Sérsic indices n, effective
semi-major axis ae and axis ratio q are ((cid:104)n(cid:105),σn) = (3.19,2.18),
((cid:104)ae(cid:105),σae ) = (6.07,5.16(pixel)) and ((cid:104)q(cid:105),σq) = (0.67,0.20). The
position angle P.A. is uniformly distributed within 0◦ < P.A. <
180◦. To ensure the simulated proﬁles are physical, we further ap-
ply the following constraints: n > 0.2, ae > 0.3, 0.01 < q (cid:54) 1.

The SGs were then convolved with the adopted PSFs. Mor-
ishita, Ichikawa & Kajisawa (2014) pointed out that there are dif-
ferences in the central part of the Sérsic proﬁles produced by IRAF
gallist and mkobjects compared to those produced by GALFIT,
which possibly originates with the PSF convolution procedure. In
our case, we produce our simulated galaxies using a custom-built
IDL routine1 that over-samples the central part of the Sérsic proﬁles
before resampling it onto a 2D grid.

To check whether the Sérsic proﬁles we generated are con-
sistent with those used in GALFIT, we ﬁrst ﬁt the noise-free SGs
with GALFIT and examine the residual maps to compare the Sér-
sic proﬁles. Without PSF convolution, we notice there are residuals
at the centre in the residuals map output by GALFIT, although the
difference is negligible (< 0.005% of the ﬂux). Including the PSF
convolution does not noticeably increase this difference.

We then inject the SGs one by one uniformly to the sky re-
gions of both the WFC3 H160 images and the PSF-matched and
resampled ACS z850 images at the same location (i.e. 50000 set of
z850 and H160 images). The segmentation maps from SExtractor are
used as a reference to avoid direct overlap with existing objects in
the ﬁeld.

A2 Photometry uncertainty test

We run SExtractor on the SG images using the same setting as for
the science sample. We then assess the detection rate of the SGs
in different magnitudes, as well as investigate the uncertainties of
the galaxy magnitude MAG_AUTO and the z850−H160 colour derived
from 1(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture magnitudes.

A3 Light-weighted structural parameter uncertainty test

We assess the accuracy of our light-weighted structural parameter
measurements by measuring the structural parameters of the SGs
with the same GALAPAGOS routine.
In Section 3.1.2 we mention there is a bias in the recovered ef-
fective radius at high mean surface brightness (< 19 mag arcsec−2)
due to unresolved SGs in our simulations. Here we expand the dis-
cussion on this. Figure A1 shows the difference between input and
recovered structural parameters by GALFIT for three subpopula-
tions of SGs with descending range of input ae in terms of the size
of PSF. We ﬁnd that the bias between input and recovered effective
radii increases sharply for SGs with input ae < PSF HWHM. For

The simulated galaxies (hereafter SGs) are uniformly distributed
within a magnitude range of 19.0 < H160 < 25.0 and a colour

there is no internal colour gradient within the set of simulated
galaxies. Nevertheless, this allows us to assess the accuracy of the
output mass-weighted structural parameters, as the retrieved pa-
rameters should be in theory, exactly the same as the input (light)
structural parameters. As the Voronoi binning and stacking take a
certain time, we perform the mass map conversion for a subsample
of galaxies (∼ 1500). This sample is sufﬁcient to provide an un-
certainty estimates on the mass-weighted sizes in different bins of
surface brightness.

In deriving the mass maps, we implement an extrapolation
scheme to determine the M∗/L in regions with insufﬁcient signal-
to-noise (described in Section 3.6.2). The low S/N or sky regions
are problematic as the colours (and hence M∗/L) are not well de-
termined. Converting mass directly on these regions will induce a
huge scatter of mass in the background, which in turn have serious
effects on the structural parameter measurements. Our extrapola-
tion scheme can preserve the sky noise and at the same time pro-
vide a reasonable M∗/L estimate to these regions. We illustrate this
effect in Figure A2. The top panel shows the differences between
input and recovered sizes by GALFIT with extrapolation, while the
bottom panel shows the differences without applying the extrap-
olation. In the absence of extrapolation, a huge bias can be seen
in all bins of surface brightness. Sizes are more underestimated in
galaxies with low surface brightness.

Previous studies use a different method to solve this issue, for
example in Lang et al. (2014) who derived mass maps for galax-
ies in CANDELS, these low S/N regions are assigned the aver-
age M∗/L of the three nearest Voronoi bins. The data we used
in this study is not as deep as the CANDELS HST imaging. We
ﬁnd that averaging the nearest three Voronoi bins does not work as
well as our annular average extrapolation. For star-forming galax-
ies which have sub-structures such as star forming clumps and spi-
ral arms (see, e.g. Wuyts et al. 2012), it might be more suitable to
use the nearest neighbour extrapolation as in Lang et al. (2014).
Our method, on the other hand, works well for early-type galaxies
which usually have smooth(er) surface brightness proﬁles.

APPENDIX B: DETAILS OF PSF MATCHING

We ﬁrst stack the unsaturated stars in the z850 and H160 bands to ob-
tain characteristic PSFs respectively. The matching kernel is gen-
erated using the psfmatch task in IRAF. Cosine bell tapering is
applied to ﬁlter the high frequency component of the input z850
PSF, which is presumably induced by noise, to clean the output
kernel. In the psfmatch task, there are some free parameters that
can be tweaked (e.g. kernel sizes, highest cosine bell frequencies
and apodize), a systemic search is performed to ﬁnd the best pa-
rameters to match the PSFs.

We assess the accuracy by comparing the fractional encircled
energy of the z850 PSF before and after the procedure to the H160
PSF. The convolved z850 PSF matches almost perfectly to the H160
PSF with only tiny difference in the wing (< 1%). We also re-
constructed a new z850 PSF from the PSF matched z850 images to
assess the result. Figure B1 shows the fractional encircled energy of
the PSFs constructed from images before and after PSF matching.
The ratios of their growth curves deviate by < 2.5% from unity.

Figure A1. Differences between input and recovered effective semi-major
axes by GALFIT δ ae = (ae−out − ae−in)/ae−in in function of input mean
H160 surface brightness. From top to bottom: simulated galaxies with dif-
ferent ranges of input effective radius, 1.0 PSF HWHM < ae < 2.0 PSF
HWHM, 0.5 PSF HWHM < ae < 1.0 PSF HWHM and ae < 0.5 PSF
HWHM. The red line indicates the median and 1σ dispersion in different
bins (0.5 mag arcsec−2 bin width) and the green-shaded 2D histogram in
each panel shows the number density distribution of the simulated galaxies.

SGs with input ae in range of 1.0 PSF HWHM < ae < 2.0 PSF
HWHM, the average bias is typically limited to 1 − 2%, while it
increases to ∼ 10% for SGs with 0.5 PSF HWHM < ae < 1.0 PSF
HWHM. For those with ae < 0.5 PSF HWHM, the average bias
rises sharply to ∼ 50%. We conclude that our method is unable to
measure sizes reliably from galaxies with ae < 0.5 PSF HWHM.
However, since the sizes of high-redshift galaxies can indeed be
very small, we do not exclude this small-sized population from our
set of simulated galaxies.

None of the galaxies in our sample have light-weighted sizes
smaller than 0.5 PSF HWHM. Nevertheless, in the case of mass-
weighted sizes, three of the objects at the low-mass end have sizes
< 0.5 PSF HWHM and are hence discarded in the subsequent anal-
yses.

A4 Mass-weighted structural parameter uncertainty test

We also perform a similar test to investigate the biases and uncer-
tainties of our mass-weighted structural parameter measurements.
We start with the z850 and H160 postage stamps output from the
light uncertainty test. These images are converted into mass maps
with the pipeline described in Section 3.6. The resultant stacked
mass maps are then ﬁtted with GALFIT.

As mentioned in Appendix A1, the galaxies we inject have
identical initial structural parameters in both z850 and H160 bands,

The solid black line is the one-to-one relation. The error bars are the 1σ
uncertainties from both methods.

- colour relation is, which in turn depends on the colour used (see
discussion in e.g., Bell & de Jong 2001; Bell et al. 2003). Here we
assess whether our mass estimates is biased.

For this cluster, Delaye et al. (2014) estimated stellar masses
of our galaxies through SED ﬁtting with four bands (HST/ACS i775,
z850, HAWK-I, J, Ks) with BC03 models, exponential declining
SFHs and a Chabrier (2003) IMF. The setting is almost identical to
the stellar masses from the NMBS catalogue we picked to construct
the M∗/L - colour relation, thus can be compared directly.

Figure C1 shows a direct comparison of the mass estimated
using our M∗/L - colour relation and SED ﬁtting from Delaye et al.
(2014). Our sample covers 10 out of 13 early-type galaxies in their
sample. The remaining 3 galaxies are out of the ﬁeld of view of our
WFC3 images (but are in the FOV of the ACS z850 image), thus are
not included in our sample. The mass estimates from the two meth-
ods are consistent with each other, with a median difference and 1σ
scatter of 0.03± 0.09 dex. The object that deviates from the one-
to-one relation the most (at log(M∗/M(cid:12)) = 11.11) is a galaxy close
to the core of cluster with a very close neighbour (ID 368), which
probably affect the mass estimates in both methods. Removing this
object reduces the median difference to 0.01± 0.07 dex. Therefore
we conclude that the masses derived using M∗/L - colour relation
are not biased.
As we mentioned in Section 3.5, the typical uncertainty of the
mass estimates from M∗/L - colour relation is ∼ 0.1 dex, which is
comparable to the uncertainties obtained from SED ﬁtting. These
uncertainties are correct for the relative masses of multiple galax-
ies. Note that the uncertainty of the absolute stellar masses is larger
as in the case of SED ﬁtting, depending on the details of NMBS
SED ﬁtting and choice of IMF.

APPENDIX C: COMPARISON OF MASSES DERIVED
USING M∗/L - COLOUR RELATION WITH SED FITTING
In this study, the stellar masses of the galaxies are derived from an
empirical M∗/L - colour relation and the total H160 luminosity from
2D GALFIT Sérsic ﬁtting. Other studies usually estimate the stel-
lar masses through spectral energy distribution ﬁtting of multiple
photometric bands (e.g. Strazzullo et al. 2010; Delaye et al. 2014).
The advantage of using M∗/L - colour relation over SED ﬁtting is
that it does not require a number of photometric bands, hence is
a relatively inexpensive mass indicator. The accuracy of the stellar
mass estimates of then depends on how well constrained the M∗/L

described in Section 3.3. This allows us to derive 1D g− r colour
proﬁles and measure the colour gradients of the galaxies in the SPI-
DER sample by ﬁtting the logarithmic slope of their g− r proﬁles
along the major axis. The sample is split into low density and high
density environment with a halo mass cut (log(M200/M(cid:12)) < 14 and
log(M200/M(cid:12)) (cid:62) 14). The detail selection is described in Section 4.
We also apply the age cut (age > 8.98 Gyr) using age measurements
from La Barbera et al. (2010b) to correct for the progenitor bias in
the SPIDER sample. The median g− r gradient and 1σ scatter in
the local SPIDER cluster sample is ∇g−r = −0.042± 0.144 (error
on the median 0.008), while the median gradient in the low den-
sity sample is ∇g−r = −0.060±0.158 (error on the median 0.008),
consistent with La Barbera et al. (2005).
We derive the Y105 − H160 colour gradient in XMMUJ2235-
2557 with structural parameters of the Y105 and H160 bands. This
is because the above g− r colour gradients are intrinsic gradients
without PSF convolution, hence for better comparison and con-
sistency we use the same method as above. Figure E1 shows the
Y105 − H160 colour gradients, roughly corresponds to rest-frame
g− r. ∇Y105−H160 is less steep compared to ∇z850−H160, with a me-
dian and 1σ scatter of (cid:104)∇Y105−H160(cid:105) = −0.16±−0.16 (error on the
median 0.08). Hence, the g− r colour gradient at z = 1.39 is also
much steeper than the local sample.
We repeat the analysis described in Section 6.3.1 to model
the g− r colour gradients under different assumptions in the radial
variation of stellar population properties. The g− r colour is less
sensitive to age variation than (U − R) colour, as the g-band is on
the 4000Å break. Hence, the evolution in the g− r colour gradient
is less pronounced than the (U − R) gradients.
Figure E2 shows the evolution of the g − r colour gradients
(case III with solar metallicity). Despite the lack in dynamic range,
the result with the g − r colour gradient is completely consistent
with the (U − R) colour gradients, in the sense that an age-driven
gradient evolution with a metallicity gradient close to local value
(case III) is the best scenario to explain its evolution. A pure age
gradient would predict g− r gradients that are too shallow at z = 0,
while a pure metallicity gradient would predict gradients that are
too steep. In addition, we ﬁnd that the derived median age gradi-
ent is in good agreement with the one derived from (U − R) gra-
dients. The evolution can be well described with an age gradient
of ∇age = −0.33, identical to the one we found from (U − R) gra-
dients. The consistent result from g− r colour gradients reinforces
our conclusion that age gradient is necessary to explain the colour
gradient at high-redshift.

APPENDIX D: EVOLUTION OF COLOUR GRADIENTS
USING EXPONENTIALLY DECLINING TAU MODELS

In Section 6.3 we discuss the evolution of colour gradients assum-
ing the stellar population in the inner and outer regions can be
well described by simple stellar population models (SSPs). Here
we present the result of using exponentially declining tau models
with different τ (τ = [0.2,0.4,0.6]) instead of SSPs.
Figure D1 shows the U − R colour at different ages (left,
i.e. the colour-age relations) from models with various τ using
BC03, similar to Figure 15. The methodology is described in Sec-
tion 6.3.1. Comparing to SSPs, due to the continual star formation
the (U − R) colour is bluer for a given age, which is more pro-
nounced if τ is larger. We stop at τ = 0.6 as otherwise the (U − R)
colour would be too blue to account for the observations. Using
τ models also has the effect of reducing the colour differences
between different metallicities when the galaxy is young (see the
trend before the grey dashed line), while the evolution is very sim-
ilar for later ages when the contribution of young stars falls off.

Using τ models instead of SSPs does not change our main
conclusion. Since the evolution of the colour gradient at later times
is very similar to SSPs, we ﬁnd that an age-driven gradient evolu-
tion with a metallicity gradient close to the local value (case III)
remains the best scenario to explain the colour gradients indepen-
dent of the τ used. Figure D2 shows the best-ﬁt scenario of the
evolution of the colour gradients with different τ (case III with so-
lar metallicity). Within the range of τ the evolution can still be well
modelled. Nevertheless, due to the change in (U − R) colour over
time (see Figure D1), the resulting age gradient, age difference of
the inner and outer population and formation redshift for the best-
ﬁt scenario varies by a certain amount with τ. With an increasing
τ, a ﬂatter but still signiﬁcant age gradient (e.g. (cid:104)∇age(cid:105) = −0.21
for τ = 0.4) is needed to explain the colour gradient. This strength-
ens our result that an age gradient is a necessary component in the
colour gradient at high-redshift. The values of the median age gra-
dient, the evolved age gradient at z = 0 and the formation redshift
for the best-ﬁt scenario with different τs can be found in Table D1.

APPENDIX E: g− r COLOR GRADIENTS AND THEIR
EVOLUTION WITH REDSHIFT
Here we present the measurements of the Y105 − H160 colour gradi-
ent in XMMUJ2235-2557 and the g− r colour gradient in the local
SPIDER cluster sample. To compute the g− r colour gradient from
the SPIDER sample, we again make use of the structural parame-
ters in g-band and r-band of the publicly available multiband struc-
tural catalogue from La Barbera et al. (2010c). We generate 2D
Sérsic model images in the two bands with ﬁtted parameter from
the structural catalogue, then convert the 2D image in both bands
into 1D radial surface brightness proﬁles, similar to the procedure

Figure E2. Evolution of g− r colour gradient over redshift in case III (age
and metallicity gradient) with assumed solar metallicity Z = 0.02. The inner
region is assumed to have a formation redshift z f orm = 3.0. The initial age
gradient at z = 1.39 is ∇age = −0.33, and the assumed metallicity gradi-
ent is ∇Z = −0.2. The dotted lines show the evolution with different initial
age gradient as indicated (∇age = −0.1,−0.5,−0.7,−0.9). Red circles cor-
respond to the median Y105 − H160 gradient of our sample at redshift 1.39,
and the observed local g− r gradient from the SPIDER cluster sample. The
error bars show the uncertainty of the median.

Notes:
a Total stellar masses are estimated using the M∗/L-colour relation, the z850 − H160 aperture colours and the total luminosity LH160 from the best-ﬁt Sérsic models.
b 1(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture magnitudes from SExtractor.
c Colour gradients ∇z850−H160 and M∗/L gradients ∇log(M/L) are deﬁned as d(z850 − H160)/d log(a) and d(log(M/L))/d log(a) respectively. The gradient is ﬁtted
in the radial range of PSF HWHM < a < 3.5 ae.
d Mean surface brightness Σ and mean surface mass density Σmass are deﬁned as mag +2.5log(2πa2
e Mean surface mass density within a radius of 1 kpc Σ1 is deﬁned as log(M∗(<1kpc)/π(1kpc)2), derived from integrating the ﬁtted 2D mass proﬁles.
