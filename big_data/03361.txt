PRODUCTS OF MENGER SPACES:
A COMBINATORIAL APPROACH

PIOTR SZEWCZAK AND BOAZ TSABAN

Abstract. We construct Menger subsets of the real line whose product is not a Menger
subset of the plane. In contrast to earlier constructions, our approach is purely combina-
torial, and the set theoretic hypotheses used are either milder than or incompatible with
earlier ones. On the other hand, we establish productive properties for versions of Menger’s
property parameterized by ﬁlters and semiﬁlters. In particular, the hypothesis b = d im-
plies that every productively Menger set of real numbers is productively Hurewicz, and each
ultraﬁlter version of Menger’s property is strictly between Menger’s and Hurewicz’s classic
properties. We include a number of open problems emerging from this study.

1. Introduction

A topological space X is Menger if for each sequence U1, U2, . . . of open covers of the space
X, there are ﬁnite subsets F1 ⊆ U1, F2 ⊆ U2, . . . whose union forms a cover of the space X.
This property was introduced by Karl Menger [16], and reformulated as presented here by
Witold Hurewicz [11]. Menger’s property is strictly between σ-compact and Lindelöf. Now
a central notion in topology, it has applications in a number of branches of topology and
set theory. The undeﬁned notions in the following example are available in the indicated
references, but are not needed for the remainder of this paper.

Example 1.1. Menger spaces form the most general class for which a positive solution of
the D-space problem is known [2, Corolarry 2.7], and the most general class for which a
general form of Hindman’s Finite Sums Theorem holds [23]. In set theory, Menger’s property
characterizes ﬁlters whose Mathias forcing notion does not add dominating functions [9].

Menger’s property is hereditary for closed subsets and continuous images. By a classic
result of Todorčević there are, in ZFC, Menger spaces X and Y such that the product space
X × Y is not Menger [20, §3]. It remains open whether there are, in ZFC, such examples
in the real line, or even just metrizable examples [21, Problem 6.7]. This problem, proposed
by Scheepers long ago, resisted all eﬀorts thus far.

For brevity, sets of real numbers are called here real sets. Assuming the Continuum
Hypothesis, there are two Luzin sets whose product is not Menger [12, Theorem 3.7]. An
uncountable real set is Luzin if its intersection with every meager (Baire ﬁrst category) set is

1

P. SZEWCZAK AND B. TSABAN

countable. A real set X is concentrated if it has a countable subset D such that the set X \ U
is countable for every open set U containing D. Every Luzin set is concentrated, and every
concentrated set has Menger’s property. This approach extends to obtain similar examples
using a set theoretic hypothesis about the meager sets that is weaker than the Continuum
Hypothesis [18, Theorem 49]. Here, we introduce a purely combinatorial approach to this
problem. We obtain examples using hypotheses milder than earlier ones, as well as examples
using hypotheses that are incompatible with the Continuum Hypothesis. To this end, we
introduce the key notion of bi-d-unbounded set, and determine the limits on its possible
existence. We extend these results to variations of Menger’s property parameterized by
ﬁlters and semiﬁlters. For a semiﬁlter S, we introduce the notion of S-scale. These scales
provably exist, and capture a number of distinct special cases used in earlier works.

The second part of the paper, beginning with Section 5, establishes provably productive
properties among semiﬁlter-parameterized Menger properties. If S is an ultraﬁlter, then every
S-scale gives rise to a productively S-Menger space. We deduce that each of these variations
of Menger’s property is strictly inbetween Hurewicz’s and Menger’s classic properties.

The last section includes a discussion of related results and open problems suggested by

our results.

2. Products of Menger spaces

Towards a combinatorial treatment of the questions discussed here, we identify the Cantor
space {0, 1}N with the family P (N) of all subsets of the set N. Since the Cantor space is
homeomorphic to Cantor’s real set, every subspace of the space P (N) is considered as a real
set.

The space P (N) splits into two important subspaces: the family of inﬁnite subsets of N,
denoted [N]∞, and the family of ﬁnite subsets of N, denoted [N]<∞. We identify every set
a ∈ [N]∞ with its increasing enumeration, an element of the Baire space NN. Thus, for
a natural number n, a(n) is the n-th element in the increasing enumeration of the set a.
This way, we have that [N]∞ ⊆ NN, and the topology of the space [N]∞ coincides with the
subspace topology induced by NN. This explains some of the elementary assertions made
here; moreover, notions deﬁned here for [N]∞ are often adaptations of classic notions for NN.
Depending on the interpretation, points of the space [N]∞ are referred to as sets or functions.
For functions a, b ∈ [N]∞, we write a ≤ b if a(n) ≤ b(n) for all natural numbers n,
and a ≤∗ b if a(n) ≤ b(n) for almost all natural numbers n, that is, the set of exceptions
{ n : b(n) < a(n) } is ﬁnite. We follow the convention that bounded means has an upper
bound in the ambient superset.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal number. A set X ⊆ [N]∞ is κ-unbounded if
|X| ≥ κ, and the cardinality of every ≤-bounded subset of the set X is smaller than κ.

Remark 2.2. For cardinal numbers κ of uncountable coﬁnality, which will be the case in the
present paper, the notion of κ-unbounded deﬁned here is equivalent to its variation using the
relation ≤∗ instead of ≤. This is not the case for cardinal numbers of countable coﬁnality.

Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal number. A topological space X is κ-concentrated on a

countable set D ⊆ X if |X \ U| < κ for all open sets U containing D.

Every compact set K ⊆ [N]∞ is ≤-bounded. A classic argument of Lawrence [14, Propo-
sitions 2–3] implies that, for each cardinal number κ, the existence of a κ-concentrated set
is equivalent to the existence of a κ-unbounded set in [N]∞. Essentially, this is due to the
following fact.

Lemma 2.3. Let κ be a cardinal number, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be a set with |X| ≥ κ. The set X
is κ-unbounded if and only if the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is κ-concentrated on [N]<∞.

Proof. (⇒) Let U ⊆ P (N) be an open set containing the set [N]<∞. The set K := P (N) \ U
is a closed, and thus compact, subset of P (N). Since U ⊇ [N]<∞, we have that K ⊆ [N]∞.
Since compact subsets of [N]∞ are ≤-bounded and the set X is κ-unbounded, we have that

|(X ∪ [N]<∞) ∩ K| = |X ∩ K| < κ.

(⇐) For each bound b ∈ [N]∞, the set K := { a ∈ [N]∞ : a ≤ b } is compact. Thus, the
(cid:3)

set U := P (N) \ K is an open set containing [N]<∞, and we have that |X \ U| < κ.

A set X ⊆ [N]∞ is dominating if for each function a ∈ [N]∞ there is a function x ∈ X such
that a ≤∗ x. Let d be the minimal cardinality of a dominating set in [N]∞. Much information
about the cardinal number d, and about other ones deﬁned below, is available [7]. Every real
set of cardinality smaller than d is Menger, and no dominating subset of [N]∞ is Menger [12,
Theorem 4.4]. The former assertion implies that every d-concentrated real set is Menger.1

Corollary 2.4. For each d-unbounded set X ⊆ [N]∞, the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is Menger. (cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.5. For functions a, b ∈ [N]∞, we write a ≤∞ b if b ≮∗ a, that is, if a(n) ≤ b(n)
for inﬁnitely many natural numbers n. For a set X ⊆ [N]∞ and a function b ∈ [N]∞, we
write X ≤∞ b if x ≤∞ b for each function x ∈ X. This convention applies to all binary
relations.

There are, in ZFC, d-unbounded sets and cf(d)-unbounded sets: Let { dα : α < d } be
a dominating set. For each ordinal number α < d, take a function xα ∈ [N]∞ such that
{ dβ : β < α } ≤∞ xα. Then the set { xα : α < d } is d-unbounded. Taking a coﬁnal subset
I ⊆ d of cardinality cf(d), we obtain the cf(d)-unbounded set { xα : α ∈ I }.

1Moreover, d-concentrated sets have the stronger selective property S1(Γ, O) [6, 22].

Lemma 2.6. For sets a, b ∈ P (N), let

a ⊎ b := (2a) ∪ (2b + 1) = { 2k : k ∈ a } ∪ { 2k + 1 : k ∈ b }.

Then:

(1) For each set a ∈ [N]∞ and each natural number n, we have that (a⊎a)(2n) = 2a(n)+1.
(2) For all sets a, b, c, d ∈ [N]∞ with a ≤ b and c ≤ d, we have that a ⊎ c ≤ b ⊎ d.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.7. Let κ ∈ {cf(d), d}, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be a set containing a κ-unbounded set.
There is a d-concentrated real set Y such that the planar set X × Y is not Menger.

Proof. Let A ⊆ X be a κ-unbounded set. By moving to a subset of A, we may assume that
|A| = κ. Let D ⊆ [N]∞ be a dominating set of cardinality d. Decompose

D = [

a∈A

Ia

such that |Sa∈B Ia| < d for all sets B ⊆ A of cardinality smaller than κ. (If κ = d, we
can take every set Ia to be a singleton). Fix elements a ∈ A and d ∈ Ia. Take a function
d′ ∈ [N]∞ such that a, d ≤ d′. Consider the set { a ⊎ d′ : a ∈ A, d ∈ Ia }. Its cardinality is
at most d, and since its projection on the odd coordinates is dominating, its cardinality is
exactly d.

Claim 2.8. The set { a ⊎ d′ : a ∈ A, d ∈ Ia } is d-unbounded.

Proof. Let b ∈ [N]∞. Deﬁne b′(n) := b(2n) for all natural numbers n. Let K := { a ∈ A :
a ≤ b′ }. Then |K| < κ.

Let a ∈ A \ K and d ∈ Ia. There is a natural number n such that

b(2n) = b′(n) < a(n) ≤ 2a(n) + 1 = (a ⊎ a)(2n) ≤ (a ⊎ d′)(2n),

and thus a ⊎ d′ (cid:2) b. Therefore,

|{ a ⊎ d′ : a ∈ A, d ∈ Ia, a ⊎ d′ ≤ b }| ≤ |{ a ⊎ d′ : a ∈ K, d ∈ Ia }| < d.

(cid:3)

By Lemma 2.3, the real set

Y := { a ⊎ d′ : a ∈ A, d ∈ Ia } ∪ [N]<∞

is d-concentrated on the set [N]<∞. In particular, the set Y is Menger.

For sets a, b ∈ P (N), let a ⊕ b denote the symmetric diﬀerence of the sets a and b. With

respect to the operator ⊕, the space P (N) is a topological group.

Claim 2.9. The set (2X) ⊕ Y is a dominating subset of [N]∞.

PRODUCTS OF MENGER SPACES

Proof. For all sets a, b, c ∈ P (N), we have that (2a) ⊕ (b ⊎ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊎ c ⊇ 2c + 1. It follows
that (2X) ⊕ Y ⊆ [N]∞.

For each function d in the dominating set D we started with, let a ∈ A be a function such

that d ∈ Ia. As a ∈ X and a ⊎ d′ ∈ Y , we have that

2a ⊕ (a ⊎ d′) = (a ⊕ a) ⊎ d′ = ∅ ⊎ d′ = 2d′ + 1 ∈ (2X) ⊕ Y.

Since d ≤ d′ ≤ 2d′ + 1 for all functions d ∈ D, the set (2X) ⊕ Y is dominating.

(cid:3)

In summary, the set (2X) ⊕ Y is a continuous image of the planar set X × Y in [N]∞ that
(cid:3)

is dominating. It follows that the space X × Y is not Menger.

Let X be a real set of cardinality smaller than d. Then the set X is trivially Menger:
In
the topology used is irrelevant, as long as we restrict attention to countable covers.
particular, all ﬁnite powers of the real set X are Menger, even for countable Borel covers; a
strong property [18].

Theorem 2.10. Assume that cf(d) < d. There are real sets X and Y such that |X| < d and
the set Y is d-concentrated, but the planar set X × Y is not Menger.

Proof. By the discussion preceding Lemma 2.6, there are cf(d)-unbounded sets in [N]∞.
Apply Theorem 2.7 to any of these sets.
(cid:3)

Let κ be a cardinal number. A real set of cardinality at least κ is κ-Luzin if the cardinalities
of its intersections with meager sets are all smaller than κ. Let cov(M) be the minimal
cardinality of a cover of the real line by meager sets, and cof(M) be the minimal cardinality of
a coﬁnal family of meager real sets. The hypothesis cov(M) = cof(M) implies that there are
cov(M)-Luzin sets whose product is not Menger [18, Theorem 49]. Since cov(M) ≤ d, every
cov(M)-Luzin set is d-concentrated, and thus Menger. In general, cov(M) ≤ d ≤ cof(M),
and thus the following corollary implies (using the same hypothesis) that for every cov(M)-
Luzin set L there is a d-concentrated real set Y such that the planar set L × Y is not
Menger.

Corollary 2.11. Let κ ∈ {cf(d), d}. For each κ-Luzin set L, there is a d-concentrated real
set Y such that the planar set L × Y is not Menger. In particular, if ℵ1 = cf(d), then this
is the case for every Luzin set.

Proof. By applying a homeomorphism, we may assume that L ⊆ [N]∞. Every κ-Luzin subset
of [N]∞ is κ-unbounded. Apply Theorem 2.7.
(cid:3)

The most important application of Theorem 2.7 appears in the next section.

3. Bi-d-unbounded sets

For a set a ∈ P (N), let ac := N \ a. Let [N]∞,∞ := { a ∈ [N]∞ : ac ∈ [N]∞ }, the family of

inﬁnite co-inﬁnite subsets of N.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal number. A set X ⊆ [N]∞,∞ is bi-κ-unbounded
if the sets X and { xc : x ∈ X } ⊆ [N]∞ are both κ-unbounded.

Theorem 3.2. Let κ ∈ {cf(d), d}. Let X ⊆ [N]∞ be a bi-κ-unbounded set. Then:

(1) The real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is κ-concentrated. In particular, it is Menger.
(2) There is a d-concentrated real set Y such that the planar set (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is not

Menger.

Proof. (1) By Corollary 2.4.

(2) The continuous image { xc : x ∈ X ∪ [N]<∞ } of the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ in P (N) is a
(cid:3)

κ-unbounded subset of [N]∞. Apply Theorem 2.7.

The existence of bi-d-unbounded sets and bi-cf(d)-unbounded sets is a mild hypothesis.
A set r ∈ [N]∞ reaps a family A ⊆ [N]∞ if, for each set a ∈ A, both sets a ∩ r and a \ r are
inﬁnite. Let r be the minimal cardinality of a family A ⊆ [N]∞ that no set r reaps.

For natural numbers n < m, let [n, m) := {n, n + 1, . . . , m − 1}.

Theorem 3.3. The following assertions are equivalent:

(1) d ≤ r.
(2) There are bi-d-unbounded sets in [N]∞.
(3) There are bi-cf(d)-unbounded sets in [N]∞.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2), (3): We use the following lemma, to which we provide a short, direct proof.

Lemma 3.4 (Mejía [15]). Let X ⊆ [N]∞. If |X| < min{d, r}, then there is an element
b ∈ [N]∞,∞ such that X ≤∞ b and X ≤∞ bc.

Proof. For a set x ∈ [N]∞ with 1 /∈ x, deﬁne a function ˜x ∈ [N]∞ by ˜x(1) := x(1), and
˜x(n + 1) := x(˜x(n)) for each natural number n.

We may assume that 1 /∈ x for all sets x ∈ X. Since |X| < d, there is a function a ∈ [N]∞

such that the sets

are inﬁnite for all sets x ∈ X [7, Theorem 2.10]. Since |X| < r, there is a set r ∈ [N]∞ that
reaps the family { Ix : x ∈ X }. Deﬁne

Ix := { n : |[a(n), a(n + 1)) ∩ ˜x| ≥ 2 }

b := [

n∈r

[a(n), a(n + 1)).

Fix a set x ∈ X. Let n be a member of the inﬁnite set r ∩ Ix. There are at least two
elements in the set [a(n), a(n + 1)) ∩ ˜x;
let ˜x(i) be the minimal one. Then x(˜x(i)) =

PRODUCTS OF MENGER SPACES

7

˜x(i + 1) ∈ [a(n), a(n + 1)). Since n ∈ r, the set bc ∩ [a(n), a(n + 1)) is empty, and thus
a(n + 1) ≤ bc(˜x(i)). It follows that x(˜x(i)) < bc(˜x(i)). Similarly, every number n ∈ Ix \ r
produces a number i such that x(˜x(i)) < b(˜x(i)).
(cid:3)

Let { dα : α < d } ⊆ [N]∞ be a dominating set. By Lemma 3.4, for each ordinal number
α < d, there is a set xα ∈ [N]∞,∞ such that { dβ : β < α } ≤∞ xα, xc
α. Then the set
{ xα : α < d } is bi-d-unbounded. Let I be a coﬁnal subset of the cardinal number d, of
cardinality cf(d). Then the set { xα : α ∈ I } is bi-cf(d)-unbounded.

(2) ⇒ (1): We may assume that the cardinal number d is regular. Indeed, it is known

that if r < d then d is regular.2 Thus, if d is singular, then d ≤ r, and we are done.

Let X ⊆ [N]∞ be a bi-d-unbounded set. Let A ⊆ [N]∞ be a family with |A| < d. We prove
that the family A is reapable. We may assume that for each set a ∈ A and each ﬁnite set s,
we have that a \ s ∈ A.

Since the set X is bi-d-unbounded, the set

{ x ∈ X : x ≤∗ a or x ≤∗ ac }

[

a∈A

is a union of less than d sets, each of cardinality smaller than d. Thus, there is an element
r ∈ X that is not included in that set, that is, such that A <∞ r, rc.

The set r reaps the family A: Fix a set a ∈ A. Assume that the set a ∩ r is ﬁnite. Then
the set a′ := a \ r is in A, and thus a′ <∞ rc. But a′ ⊆ rc, and thus rc ≤ a′; a contradiction.
For the same reason, the set a \ r is inﬁnite, too.

(3) ⇒ (1): If the cardinal number d is regular, then the previously established implication
applies. And if it is singular, then as explained in the previous implication, we have that
d ≤ r. In either case, we are done.
(cid:3)

A topological space X is Rothberger if for each sequence U1, U2, . . . of open covers of X,
there are elements U1 ∈ U1, U2 ∈ U2, . . . with X ⊆ Sn Un. Every real set of cardinality
smaller than cov(M) is Rothberger [12, Theorem 4.2], and therefore so is every cov(M)-
concentrated real set.

Corollary 3.5. Assume that cov(M) = d. Then there are two Rothberger real sets whose
product is not Menger.
(cid:3)

4. Filter-Menger spaces

For sets a, b ∈ [N]∞, we write a ⊆∗ b if the set a \ b is ﬁnite. A semiﬁlter [4] is a set
S ⊆ [N]∞ such that, for each set s ∈ S and each set b ∈ [N]∞ with s ⊆∗ b, we have that

2In the notation of Section 4, ﬁx an ultraﬁlter U with pseudobase P of cardinality r [7, Theo-
rem 9.9], and take a ≤U -dominating set D of cardinality b(U), a regular cardinal number. Then the set
{ f ◦ p : f ∈ D, p ∈ P } is dominating, and thus d ≤ b(U)(≤ d).

8

P. SZEWCZAK AND B. TSABAN

b ∈ S.3 Important examples of semiﬁlters include the maximal semiﬁlter [N]∞, the minimal
semiﬁlter of all coﬁnite sets, and every nonprincipal ultraﬁlter on N.

Let S be a semiﬁlter. For functions a, b ∈ [N]∞, let

[a ≤ b] := { n : a(n) ≤ b(n) }.

We write a ≤S b if [a ≤ b] ∈ S. Let b(S) be the minimal cardinality of a ≤S-unbounded
subset of [N]∞. For a semiﬁlter S, let S+ := { a ∈ [N]∞ : ac /∈ S }. For all sets a ∈ S and
b ∈ S+, the intersection a ∩ b is inﬁnite. For functions a, b ∈ [N]∞, we have that a (cid:2)S b if
and only if b <S+ a. The κ-unbounded sets presented in the previous sections are instances
of the following notion, which generalizes the earlier notion of b(S)-scale [25, Deﬁnition 2.8].

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let S be a semiﬁlter. A set X ⊆ [N]∞ is an S-scale if for each function
b ∈ [N]∞ there is a function c ∈ [N]∞ such that

for all but less than b(S) functions x ∈ X.

Proposition 4.2. For each semiﬁlter S there is an S-scale.

b ≤S+ c ≤S x

Proof. Let { bα : α < b(S) } ⊆ [N]∞ be a ≤S-unbounded set. For each ordinal number α <
b(S), there is a function xα ∈ [N]∞ such that { bβ : β < α } ≤S xα. The set { xα : α < b(S) }
is an S-scale. Indeed, ﬁx a function b ∈ [N]∞. There is an ordinal number β < b(S) such
that bβ (cid:2)S b, and thus b ≤S+ bβ. For each ordinal number α > β, we have that bβ ≤S xα. (cid:3)

Let S be a semiﬁlter, and b, c, x ∈ [N]∞ functions satisfying b ≤S+ c ≤S x. Then the set
[b ≤ x] contains the intersection [b ≤ c] ∩ [c ≤ x] of an element of S+ and an element of S.
In particular, we have that b ≤∞ x.

Proposition 4.3. Let S be a semiﬁlter. Every S-scale is a b(S)-unbounded subset of [N]∞,
and thus its union with the set [N]<∞ is b(S)-concentrated. In particular, no union of an
S-scale and [N]<∞ is σ-compact [22, Lemma 1.6].
(cid:3)

Let S be a semiﬁlter. A topological space X is S-Menger if for each sequence U1, U2, . . .
of open covers of X, there are ﬁnite sets F1 ⊆ U1, F2 ⊆ U2, . . . such that { n : x ∈ S Fn } ∈ S
for all points x ∈ X. A topological space is Menger if and only if it is [N]∞-Menger. For
the minimal semiﬁlter S of coﬁnite sets, the property S-Menger is the classic Hurewicz
property [11]. Thus, we have the following implications.

Hurewicz =⇒ S-Menger =⇒ Menger.

3Semiﬁlters are normally denoted by calligraphic letters. Here, we view them as sets of points in, and thus
subspaces of, the Cantor space P (N). Thus, we use the standard typefaces, as we do for arbitrary points
and sets in topological spaces.

A function Ψ from a topological space X into [N]∞ is upper continuous if the sets { x ∈
X : Ψ(x)(n) ≤ m } are open for all natural numbers n and m. In particular, continuous
functions are upper continuous. By earlier methods [17, Theorem 7.3], we have the following
result.

Proposition 4.4. Let X be a topological space, and S be a semiﬁlter. The following asser-
tions are equivalent:

(1) The space X is S-Menger.
(2) The space X is Lindelöf, and every upper continuous image of X in [N]∞ is ≤S-
(cid:3)

bounded.

For especially nice classes of spaces, such as Lindelöf zero-dimensional spaces or real sets,
upper continuous can be replaced by continuous in Proposition 4.4. In general, however, this
is not the case: The properties considered here are hereditary for closed subsets. Consider
the planar set

X := ((R \ Q) × [0, 1]) ∪ (R × {1}) ⊆ R2.

This set is not Menger, since the non-Menger set (R \ Q) × {0} (homeomorphic to [N]∞)
is closed in X. Since the set X is connected, every continuous image of X in [N]∞ is a
singleton.

For a set a ∈ S+, let

Sa := { c ∈ [N]∞ : ∃s ∈ S, s ∩ a ⊆∗ c },

the semiﬁlter generated by the sets { s∩a : s ∈ [N]∞ }. The following observation generalizes
an earlier result [25, Theorem 2.14].

Proposition 4.5. Let S be a semiﬁlter, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be an S-scale. Every upper contin-
uous image of the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ in [N]∞ is ≤Sa -bounded for some set a ∈ S+.

Proof. Let Ψ : X ∪ [N]<∞ → [N]∞ be an upper continuous function. In the degenerated case
where Y = {0}, the forthcoming Lemma 5.1 was, implicitly, established by Bartoszyński and
Shelah [5, Lemma 2]. This lemma provides a function b ∈ [N]∞ such that Ψ(x)(n) ≤ b(n)
for all functions x ∈ X and all natural numbers n with b(n) ≤ x(n). Since the set X is
an S-scale, there is a function c ∈ [N]∞ such that b ≤S+ c ≤S x for all but less than b(S)
functions x ∈ X. For these points x, we have that Ψ(x)(n) ≤ b(n) for all natural numbers
n ∈ [b ≤ c] ∩ [c ≤ x]. Take a := [b ≤ c].

The image of the remaining points of the set X ∪ [N]<∞ is ≤S-bounded by some member
(cid:3)

b′ ∈ [N]∞. Then any function d ∈ [N]∞ with b, b′ ≤ d is a bound as required.

By ﬁlter we mean a semiﬁlter closed under ﬁnite intersections.

If F is a ﬁlter, then

a ∩ b ∈ F + for all sets a ∈ F and b ∈ F +. And if F is an ultraﬁlter, then F + = F .

Corollary 4.6. For every ﬁlter F , the union of every F -scale and [N]<∞ is F +-Menger, and
if F is an ultraﬁlter, this union is F -Menger.
(cid:3)

Let b be the minimal cardinality of a ≤∗-unbounded subset of [N]∞.

Theorem 4.7. Assume that b = d. For every nonmeager semiﬁlter S there are an S-scale
X ⊆ [N]∞ and a d-concentrated real set Y such that the planar set (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is not
Menger.

Proof. Let { dα : α < d } be a dominating subset of [N]∞. Fix an ordinal number α < d.
Since b = d, there is a function b ∈ [N]∞ such that { dβ : β < α } ≤∗ b. The set { x ∈ [N]∞,∞ :
b ≤∞ xc } is comeager. Since the semiﬁlter S is nonmeager, the set { x ∈ [N]∞,∞ : b ≤S x }
is nonmeager [25, Corollary 3.4]. Thus, there is a set xα ∈ [N]∞,∞ such that b ≤S xα and
α. Then the set X := { xα : α < d } is an S-scale, and it is bi-d-unbounded. Apply
b ≤∞ xc
Theorem 2.7.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.7 fails for all meager semiﬁlters: Let S be a meager semiﬁlter, and X ⊆ [N]∞
be an S-scale. By Theorem 5.4 below, the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is, in particular, Hurewicz,
and thus its product with every d-concentrated real set is Menger [26, Theorem 4.6].

The real set X ∪ [N]<∞ in Theorem 4.7 is not Hurewicz since its image under the function
x 7→ xc is unbounded in [N]∞. The existence of non-Hurewicz sets of this form follows from a
weaker hypothesis [25, Theorem 3.9], but without the non-productive property. The product
of every Hurewicz real set and every d-concentrated real set is Menger [26, Theorem 4.6].
The following theorem implies that this assertion cannot be established for spaces that are
not Hurewicz.

Let P be a property of topological spaces. A real set X is productively P if for each
topological space Y with the property P, the product space X × Y has the property P. The
question whether productively P implies productively Q, for P and Q covering properties
among those studied here, has a long history. The remainder of this paragraph assumes that
d = ℵ1. Aurichi and Tall [3] improved several earlier results by proving that every produc-
tively Lindelöf space is Hurewicz. It was later shown that every productively Lindelöf space
is productively Hurewicz and productively Menger [17, Theorem 8.2]. Thus, productively
Lindelöf implies productively Menger, and the following theorem shows that productively
Menger suﬃces to imply productively Hurewicz.

Theorem 4.8. Assume that b = d.

(1) For every unbounded set X ⊆ [N]∞, there is a d-concentrated real set Y such that the

planar set X × Y is not Menger.

(2) In the realm of hereditarily Lindelöf spaces: If a real set X is productively Menger,

then it is productively Hurewicz.

Proof. (1) Let { dα : α < d } be a dominating set in [N]∞. Since b = d, for each ordinal
number α < d the set { dβ : β < α } is bounded, and thus there is a function xα ∈ X such
that { dβ : β < α } ≤∞ xα. Then the subset { xα : α < d } of the set X is d-unbounded, and
Theorem 2.7 applies.

(2) Assume that there is a Hurewicz hereditarily Lindelöf space H such that the product
space X × H is not Hurewicz. Then there is an unbounded upper continuous image Z of
the space X × H in [N]∞ [17, Theorem 7.3]. By (1), there is a d-concentrated real set Y
such that the planar set Z × Y is not Menger. Since the set Z × Y is an upper continuous
image of the product space X × H × Y , the latter space is not Menger, too. As the space
H is Hurewicz and hereditarily Lindelöf and the set Y is d-concentrated, the product space
H × Y is Menger [26, Theorem 4.6]. In summary, the product of the real set X and the
Menger, hereditarily Lindelöf space H × Y is not Menger.

5. Productive real sets

In this section, we establish preservation of some properties under products. We begin

with a generalization of an earlier result [17, Lemma 6.3] to general topological spaces.

Lemma 5.1 (Productive Two Worlds Lemma). Let X be a subset of [N]∞, Y be an arbitrary
space, and Ψ : (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y → [N]∞ be an upper continuous function. There is an upper
continuous function Φ : Y → [N]∞ such that, for all points x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , and n ∈ N:

If Φ(y)(n) ≤ x(n), then Ψ(x, y)(n) ≤ Φ(y)(n).

Proof. For natural numbers n and m, let U n
natural number n, the family { U n
space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y . By extending the sets U n
the larger space P (N) × Y .

m := Ψ−1[{ a ∈ [N]∞ : a(n) ≤ m }]. For each
m : m ∈ N } is an increasing open cover of the product
m, we may assume that they are open in

Fix a point y ∈ Y and a natural number n. Set m1 := 1, a(1) := 1, and V1 := Y . For a
natural number k, let mk+1 be the minimal natural number with P ([1, a(k))) × {y} ⊆ U n
mk+1.
Let a(k + 1) be the minimal natural number such that P (N \ [a(k), a(k + 1))) × {y} ⊆ U n
mk+1.
Since the set P (N\[a(k), a(k+1)))×{y} is compact, there is an open neighborhood Vk+1 ⊆ Vk
of the point y such that

P (N \ [a(k), a(k + 1))) × Vk+1 ⊆ U n

mk+1.
1, . . . , m′

For each point y ′ ∈ Vn+1, the corresponding sequences m′
n+1 and a′(1), . . . , a′(n + 1)
are, respectively, bounded by the sequences m1, . . . , mn+1 and a(1), . . . , a(n + 1) deﬁned for
y. Thus, deﬁning

we have that Φ(y ′)(n) ≤ Φ(y)(n) for all points y ′ ∈ Vn+1. Thus, the function Φ is upper
continuous.

Φ(y)(n) := max{mn+1, a(n + 1)},

12

P. SZEWCZAK AND B. TSABAN

Fix a point y ∈ Y and a natural number n. Let x ∈ [N]∞ be an element with Φ(y)(n) ≤
x(n). Let a and m1, m2, . . . be the sequences corresponding to y and n. As a(n + 1) ≤
Φ(y)(n) ≤ x(n), there is a natural number k ≤ n such that x ∩ [a(k), a(k + 1)) = ∅. Thus,

(x, y) ∈ P (N \ [a(k), a(k + 1))) × Vk+1 ⊆ U n

mk+1 ⊆ U n

Φ(y)(n),

and therefore Ψ(x, y)(n) ≤ Φ(y)(n).

(cid:3)

For ﬁlters, we obtain a productive version of Proposition 4.5.

Theorem 5.2. Let F be a ﬁlter and X ⊆ [N]∞ be an F -scale. For each F -Menger space Y ,
every upper continuous image of the product space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y in [N]∞ is ≤Fa-bounded
for some set a ∈ F +.

Proof. Let Ψ : (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y → [N]∞ be an upper continuous function. Let Φ : Y → [N]∞
be as in the Productive Two Worlds Lemma (Lemma 5.1). Since the space Y is F -Menger,
there is a function b ∈ [N]∞ such that Φ[Y ] ≤F b. As the set X is an F -scale, there is a
function c ∈ [N]∞ such that b ≤F + c ≤F x for all but less than b(F ) elements of X. Let
a := [b ≤ c], an element of the semiﬁlter F +. Then the cardinality of the set

Z := { x ∈ X : b (cid:2)Fa x }

is smaller than b(F ).

Fix a pair (x, y) ∈ (X \ Z) × Y . Then b ≤Fa x and Φ(y) ≤F b. Since F is a ﬁlter, we have

that

[Φ(y) ≤ x] ⊇ [Φ(y) ≤ b] ∩ [b ≤ x] ∈ Fa.

This shows that Ψ[(X \Z)×Y ] ≤Fa b. Let z ∈ Z ∪[N]<∞. Since the set {z}×Y is F -Menger,
Ψ[{z} × Y ] ≤F cz for some function cz ∈ [N]∞. Since |Z ∪ [N]<∞| < b(F ), there is a function
c ∈ [N]∞ such that { cz : z ∈ Z ∪[N]<∞ } ≤F c. As F is a ﬁlter, we have that Ψ[(Z ∪[N]<∞)×
Y ] ≤F c, and therefore Ψ[(X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y ] ≤Fa { max{b(n), c(n)} : n ∈ N }.
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.3. Let F be a ﬁlter, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be an F -scale. In the realm of hereditarily
Lindelöf spaces:

(1) For each F -Menger Y , the product space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is F +-Menger.
(2) If F is an ultraﬁlter, then the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is productively F -Menger.

Proof. Every product of a metrizable Lindelöf space and a hereditarily Lindelöf spaces is
Lindelöf. Apply Theorem 5.2.
(cid:3)

The following theorem was previously known for b-scales, a special kind of S-scales, where
S is the ﬁlter of coﬁnite sets [17, Theorem 6.5]. This theorem and the subsequent one improve
upon earlier results [25, Corollary 4.4], asserting that the corresponding properties hold in
all ﬁnite powers.

A semiﬁlter S is meager if and only if there is a function h ∈ [N]∞ such that for each
set s ∈ S, the set s ∩ [h(n), h(n + 1)) is nonempty for almost all natural numbers n [19,
Theorem 21]. For meager semiﬁlters S, we have that b(S) = b [25, Corollary 2.27], and
S-Menger is equivalent Hurewicz [25, Theorem 2.32]. The following theorem generalizes an
earlier result [25, Theorem 2.28], using a similar proof.

Theorem 5.4. Let S be a meager semiﬁlter, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be an S-scale. For each Hurewicz
hereditarily Lindelöf space Y , the product space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is Hurewicz.

Proof. Since the space Y is hereditarily Lindelöf, the product space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is
Lindelöf. Let Φ : X × Y → [N]∞ be an upper continuous function and Ψ : Y → [N]∞ be the
upper continuous function provided by the Productive Two Worlds Lemma (Lemma 5.1).
Since the space Y is Hurewicz, its image Ψ[Y ] is ≤∗-bounded by some function b ∈ [N]∞.
Let h ∈ [N]∞ be a witness for the semiﬁlter S being meager. Deﬁne a function ˜b ∈ NN by

˜b(k) := b(h(n + 2))

for all natural numbers n and for k ∈ [h(n), h(n + 1)). Then Ψ[Y ] ≤∗ b ≤ ˜b.

Since the set X is an S-scale, there is a function c ∈ [N]∞ such that ˜b ≤S+ c and all but

less than b functions x ∈ X belong to the set

˜X := { x ∈ X : c ≤S x }.
Claim 5.5. The set Φ[( ˜X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y ] is ≤∗-bounded.
Proof. Fix a function x ∈ ˜X. Then [c ≤ x] ∈ S, and thus the set [c ≤ x] ∩ [h(n), h(n + 1))
is nonempty for almost all natural numbers n. Let

d := n n ∈ N : [˜b ≤ c] ∩ [h(n − 1), h(n)) 6= ∅ o.

Then, for almost all natural numbers n ∈ d, there are natural numbers l ∈ [˜b ≤ c] ∩ [h(n −
1), h(n)) and m ∈ [c ≤ x] ∩ [h(n), h(n + 1)), and we have

b(h(n + 1)) = ˜b(l) ≤ c(l) ≤ c(m) ≤ x(m) ≤ x(h(n + 1)).

Thus, b(k) ≤ x(k) for almost all natural numbers k ∈ e := { h(n + 1) : n ∈ d }.

Let y ∈ Y . Since Ψ[Y ] ≤∗ b, for almost all natural numbers k ∈ e we have that

and thus

Ψ(y)(k) ≤ b(k) ≤ x(k),

Φ(x, y)(k) ≤ Ψ(y)(k) ≤ b(k).

Hence, the set Φ[ ˜X × Y ] is ≤∗-bounded on an inﬁnite set, and thus [10, Fact 3.4] ≤∗-
bounded.
(cid:3)

14

P. SZEWCZAK AND B. TSABAN

As | (X \ ˜X)∪[N]<∞ | < b and the space Y is Hurewicz, the image Φ[((X \ ˜X)∪[N]<∞)×Y ]
is a union of less than b sets that are ≤∗-bounded, and is thus ≤∗-bounded. Thus, the entire
image Φ[(X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y ] is ≤∗-bounded.
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.6. Assume that b = d. For every nonmeager ﬁlter F , the property F -Menger
is strictly between Hurewicz and Menger.

Proof. By Theorem 4.7, there are an F -scale X and a d-concentrated real set Y such that
the planar set (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is not Menger. As mentioned in the discussion following
Theorem 4.7, the set X ∪ [N]<∞ is not Hurewicz.

Assume that F -Menger is equivalent to Menger. Then the given d-concentrated set is
F -Menger, and by Theorem 5.3, the set (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y is F +-Menger and, in particular,
Menger; a contradiction.
(cid:3)

6. Comments and open problems

We restrict attention to real sets throughout this section, except for the last subsection.
The Menger productivity problem, whether Menger’s property is consistently preserved by
ﬁnite products, remains open. The hypothesis d ≤ r provides two Menger sets whose product
is not Menger (Theorems 2.7 and 3.2). It is well known that this immediately provides a
Menger set whose square is not Menger. Indeed, assume that X and Y are Menger real sets
such that the planar set X × Y is not Menger. The set X ∪ Y is Menger. We may assume
that X ⊆ (0, 1) and Y ⊆ (2, 3). Then the set X ×Y is a closed subset of the square (X ∪Y )2.
Menger’s property is hereditary for closed subsets.

6.1. Coﬁnal S-scales. The following deﬁnition generalizes the earlier notion of coﬁnal b(S)-
scale [25, Deﬁnition 2.22].

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let S be a semiﬁlter. A set X ⊆ [N]∞ is a coﬁnal S-scale if for each
function b ∈ [N]∞, we have that b ≤S x for all but less than b(S) functions x ∈ X.

Using the methods of this paper, we have the following generalizations of an earlier re-

sult [17, Theorem 6.2].

Theorem 6.2. Let S be a semiﬁlter, and X ⊆ [N]∞ be a coﬁnal S-scale. Then:

(1) The real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is S-Menger.
(2) If S is a ﬁlter, then the real set X ∪ [N]<∞ is productively S-Menger.

(cid:3)

6.2. A combinatorial characterization of the cardinal number min{r, d}. Aubrey [1]
proved that min{d, u} ≤ r. Since r ≤ u, the hypothesis d ≤ r in Theorem 3.3 is equivalent
to the hypothesis d ≤ u.

Initially, we proved Theorem 3.3 using a stronger hypothesis.

PRODUCTS OF MENGER SPACES

15

Deﬁnition 6.3. Let bidi be the minimal cardinality of a set X ⊆ [N]∞ such that there is
no set b ∈ [N]∞,∞ with X ≤∞ b, bc.

We observed that max{b, cov(M)} ≤ bidi ≤ min{r, d}, and needed that bidi = d to carry
out our construction. It is immediate that bidi ≤ d, and the argument in the proof of the
implication (2) ⇒ (1) in Theorem 3.3 shows that bidi ≤ r. Answering our question, Mejía
pointed out to us that, by a result of Kamburelis and Węglorz, the right inequality is an
equality [15] (see Lemma 3.4). We thus have the following characterization of min{r, d}.

Proposition 6.4. bidi = min{r, d}.

(cid:3)

6.3. Which κ-unbounded sets are not productively Menger? There are, in ZFC, b-
unbounded sets (e.g., by Proposition 4.2). Every union of less than max{b, g} Menger sets
is Menger [27, 24]. Since the hypothesis b < g is consistent, Theorem 2.7 and Corollary 2.11
do not extend to the case κ = b, or to any cardinal number that is consistently smaller than
max{b, g}. It is unknown whether, provably, every union of less than cf(d) Menger sets is
Menger. If it is, then the answer to the following problem is negative.

Problem 6.5. Do Theorem 2.7 or Corollary 2.11 extend to any cardinal that is consistently
smaller than cf(d)?

For a κ-unbounded set of cardinality κ (which we may assume is the case), the present proof
of Theorem 2.7 requires a partition d = Sα<κ Iα such that for each set J ⊆ κ with |J| < d,
we have that |Sα∈J Iα| < d. It is not diﬃcult to see that this implies that κ ∈ {cf(d), d}.
Problem 6.6. Let κ be a cardinal number with cf(d) < κ < d, and X be a κ-unbounded set
in [N]∞. Is there necessarily a d-concentrated set Y such that the planar set X × Y is not
Menger?

6.4. Products of Hurewicz sets. The following problem is intriguing.

Problem 6.7 (Scheepers [21, Problem 6.7]). Is it consistent that every product of two Hure-
wicz sets is Hurewicz?

To this end, it is important to ﬁnd mild hypotheses implying that there are two Hurewicz
sets whose product is not Hurewicz. Let F be the ﬁlter of all coﬁnite subsets of the set N.
In the notation of Section 4, Menger’s property is [N]∞-Menger, and Hurewicz’s property is
F-Menger. By Theorems 3.2 and 3.3, [N]∞-scales need not be productively [N]∞-Menger. In
contrast, by Theorem 5.4, F-scales are productively F-Menger. Thus, modern constructions
of Hurewicz sets do not help in regard to Problem 6.7. The classic example of a Hurewicz set
(if not counting σ-compact sets, which are productively Hurewicz) is a Sierpiński set [22]. If
b = cov(N ) = cof(N ), then there is a b-Sierpiński set (which is Hurewicz) whose square is
not Hurewicz [18, Theorem 43]. No more general constructions are known.

16

P. SZEWCZAK AND B. TSABAN

Problem 6.8. Does the Continuum Hypothesis imply that no Sierpiński set is productively
Hurewicz? Productively Menger?

We do not even know consistent answers to the following problem. We only know that, if

b = d, then every productively Menger set is productively Hurewicz (Theorem 4.8).

Problem 6.9. Do the classes of productively Menger and productively Hurewicz sets coin-
cide?

Recall that for meager semiﬁlters S, being S-Menger is equivalent to being Hurewicz [25,
Theorem 2.32]. By Theorem 5.4, in this case, for each S-scale X, the set X ∪ [N]<∞ is
productively S-Menger. In light of Theorem 4.7, the following two problems are natural.

Problem 6.10. Assume the Continuum Hypothesis. Let S be a nonmeager semiﬁlter. Is
there, necessarily, an S-scale X such that the set X ∪ [N]<∞ is not productively S-Menger?

A b-scale [22] is a particularly simple kind of an F-scale, for F the ﬁlter of coﬁnite sets.

Problem 6.11. Let X ⊆ [N]∞ be a b-scale. Is the set X ∪ [N]<∞ necessarily productively
Menger?

If u < g, then every d-concentrated set (in particular, every S-scale set, for any semiﬁtler

S) is productively Menger [17, Theorem 4.7].

6.5. Strictly unbounded sets. Say that a set X ⊆ [N]∞ is strictly unbounded if for every
set A ⊆ [N]∞ of cardinality smaller than d there is a function x ∈ X such that A ≤∞ x. Let
X ⊆ [N]∞ be a strictly unbounded set. By the argument in the proof of Theorem 4.8(1), the
set X contains a d-unbounded set. By Theorem 2.7, there is a d-concentrated set Y such
that the planar set X × Y is not Menger. If b = d, then every unbounded set in [N]∞ is
strictly unbounded. We thus obtain a generalization of Theorem 4.8.

The construction in Theorem 3.3 that provides a Menger set that is not productively

Menger provides, in fact, a Menger strictly unbounded set.

A negative answer to the second item of the following problem implies a negative solution

for the Menger productivity problem.

Problem 6.12.

(1) Is it consistent that r < d and there are strictly unbounded Menger sets?
(2) Is it consistent that there are no strictly unbounded Menger sets?

6.6. General spaces. Let S be a semiﬁlter. A space is countably S-Menger if it is S-Menger
with respect to countable covers. This property makes it possible to eliminate the adjective
“hereditarily Lindelöf” in most of our theorems.

For general Hurewicz spaces, the following problem remains open, even for the so-called

b-scales [22, Deﬁnition 2.8].

PRODUCTS OF MENGER SPACES

Problem 6.13. Let F be the semiﬁlter of coﬁnite sets, X ⊆ [N]∞ be an F-scale, and Y be a
Hurewicz space. Is the product space (X ∪ [N]<∞) × Y necessarily Hurewicz?

Theorem 5.4 provides a positive answer for hereditarily Lindelöf spaces Y . But this re-
striction is only needed for deducing that the product space (X ∪[N]<∞)×Y is Lindelöf (and
similarly for the other results in Section 4). A positive solution for the following problem
would suﬃce.

Problem 6.14. Let X be a real set of cardinality smaller than b, and Y be a Hurewicz space.
Is the product space X × Y necessarily Lindelöf?
