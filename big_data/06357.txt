THE FOURIER EXPANSION OF ηpzqηp2zqηp3zq{ηp6zq

CHRISTIAN KASSEL AND CHRISTOPHE REUTENAUER

Abstract. We compute the Fourier coeﬃcients of the weight one modular form
ηpzqηp2zqηp3zq{ηp6zq in terms of the number of representations of an integer as
a sum of two squares. We deduce a relation between this modular form and
translates of the modular form ηpzq4{ηp2zq2.

In this note we consider the η-product

The η-product ηpzqηp2zqηp3zq{ηp6zq is a modular form of weight 1 and level 6.
Since it is invariant under the transformation z ÞÑ z ` 1, it has a Fourier expansion
of the form

where the Fourier coeﬃcients a6pnq are integers. For general information on η-
products, see [4, Sect. 2.1].

Our ﬁrst result expresses a6pnq in terms of the number rpnq of representations
of n as the sum of two squares, i.e the number of elements px, yq P Z2 such that
x2 ` y2 “ n. Observe that rpnq is divisible by 4 for all n ě 1 (for n “ 0 we have
rp0q “ 1). The sequence rpnq appears as Sequence A004018 in [5].

Both modular forms ηpzqηp2zqηp3zq{ηp6zq and ηpzq4{ηp2zq2 came up naturally
in [3], where we computed the number Cnpqq of ideals of codimension n of the
algebra Fqrx, y, x´1, y´1s of Laurent polynomials in two variables over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld Fq of cardinality q. Equivalently, Cnpqq is the number of Fq-points of the
Hilbert scheme of n points on a two-dimensional torus. We proved that Cnpqq is
the value at q of a palindromic one-variable polynomial Cnpxq P Zrxs with integer
coeﬃcients, which we computed completely (see [3, Th. 1.3]).

We also showed (see [3, Cor. 6.2]) that the generating function of the polynomi-

als Cnpxq can be expressed as the following inﬁnite product:

(1.3)

1 ` ÿně1

Cnpxq

qn “źně1

p1 ´ qnq2

1 ´ px ` x´1qqn ` q2n .

It follows from the previous equality that Cnp1q “ 0. Actually, we proved
(see [3, Th. 1.3 and 1.4]) that there exists a polynomial Pnpxq P Zrxs such that
Cnpxq “ px ´ 1q2Pnpxq. Moreover, Pnpxq is palindromic, has non-negative coeﬃ-

cients and its value at x “ 1 is equal to the sum of divisors of n: Pnp1q “řd|n d.

When x “ e2iπ{k with k “ 2, 3, 4, or 6, then x ` x´1 “ 2 cosp2π{kq is an integer.

For such an integer k, we deﬁne the sequence akpnq by
p1 ´ qnq2

(1.4)

1 ´ 2 cosp2π{kq qn ` q2n .

ÿně0

akpnq qn “ źně1

Since 2 cosp2π{kq is an integer, so is each akpnq. It follows from (1.3) that these
integers are related to the polynomials Cnpxq by

Cnpe2iπ{kq “ akpnq e2niπ{k.

In [3] we computed a2pnq, a3pnq, and a4pnq explicitly in terms of well-known arith-
metical functions. In particular, we established the equality

(1.5)

a2pnq “ p´1qn rpnq,

where rpnq is the number of representations of n as the sum of two squares.

We also observed in [3, (1.8)] that

The question of ﬁnding an explicit expression for a6pnq had been left open in [3].
This is now solved with Theorem 1.1 of this note. In view of this theorem, of (1.5),
and of (1.6), for all m ě 0 we obtain

We had experimentally observed (see [3, Note 7]) that a6pnq “ 0 whenever
a2pnq “ 0. As a consequence of (1.7) we can now state that a6pnq “ 0 if and
only if a2pnq “ 0, i.e. if and only n is not the sum of two squares.

Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 will be proved in the next two sections.

Remarks 1.3. (a) The sequence a6pnq is Sequence A258210 in [5]. The sequence
a6p3n ` 1q is probably the opposite of Sequence A258277 in loc. cit.

(b) It can be seen from Table 1 that a6pnq is not a multiplicative function. Indeed,

a6p10q ‰ a6p2qa6p5q or a6p18q ‰ a6p2qa6p9q or a6p20q ‰ a6p4qa6p5q.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

2.1. For any odd integer m we set ξpmq “ ´2 sinpmπ{6q. Because of the well-
known properties of the sine function, ξpmq depends only on the class of m mod-
ulo 12 and we have the following equalities for all odd m:

(2.1)

ξp´mq “ ´ξpmq

and

ξpm ` 6q “ ´ξpmq,

which is equivalent to ξp´mq “ ´ξpmq and ξp6 ´ mq “ ξpmq.

We have

(2.2)

ξpmq “$’’’&

Next consider the excess function E1pn; 4q deﬁned by

It is a multiplicative function, i.e., E1pmn; 4q “ E1pm; 4q E1pn; 4q whenever m and
n are coprime. It is well known that the excess function can be computed in terms
of the prime decomposition of n. Write n “ 2c pa1
2 ¨ ¨ ¨ , where pi, qi’s
are distinct prime numbers such that pi ” 1 pmod 4q et qi ” 3 pmod 4q. Then
E1pn; 4q “ 0 if and only if one of the exponents bi is odd. If all bi’s are even, then

In the sequel we will need the following result.

Lemma 2.1. Let n be a positive integer which is not divisible by 3. We have

and ÿd|n , d odd

ξp3dq “ ´2E1pn; 4q.

CHRISTIAN KASSEL AND CHRISTOPHE REUTENAUER

Proof. Let d be an odd divisor of n; it is not divisible by 3 since n is not. Therefore,
d ” 1, 5, 7 or 11 pmod 12q. Observe that d ” 1, 5 pmod 12q if and only if d ” 1
pmod 4q since d ” 3 pmod 12q is excluded. Similarly, d ” 7, 11 pmod 12q if and
only if d ” 3 pmod 4q. Now, ξpdq “ ´1 if d ” 1, 5 and ξpdq “ 1 if d ” 7, 11

Similarly, ξp3dq “ ξp3q “ ´2 if d ” 1, 5 and ξp3dq “ ξp9q “ 2 if d ” 7, 11

ξp3dq “

ÿd|n , d”1 pmod 4q

´2 “ ´2E1pn; 4q.

(cid:3)

2.2. We now express a6pnq in terms of the function ξ introduced above.

Proposition 2.2. We have

(2.4)

a6pnq “ ÿd|n , d odd

ξˆ2n

´ d˙ .

Note that 2n{d ´ d is an odd integer since d is an odd divisor of n.

Proof. Set u “ π{k and ω “ d in Formula (9.3) of [2, p. 10]. It becomes

The formula for a6pnq follows.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let us ﬁrst mention the following well-known fact (see [1,
§ 51, Th. 65]): the number rpnq of representations of n as a sum of two squares is
related to the excess function E1pn; 4q by
(2.6)

rpnq “ 4 E1pn; 4q

for all n ě 0. It follows from this fact and from (1.5) that

(2.7)

a2pnq “ p´1qn4 E1pn; 4q.

We now distinguish three cases according to the residue of n modulo 3.

(a) We start with the case n ” 1 pmod 3q. We have n “ 3ℓ ` 1 for some non-
negative integer ℓ. Since the odd divisors d of n are not divisible by 3, they must

THE FOURIER EXPANSION OF ηpzqηp2zqηp3zq{ηp6zq

satisfy d ” 1, 5, 7 or 11 pmod 12q. Such divisors are invertible pmod 12q et we
have d2 ” 1 pmod 12q. Consequently,

2n
d

´ d “

pmod 12q.

Hence,

ξˆ2n

d

´ d˙ “ ξp2nd ´ dq “ ξp6dℓ ` dq “ pp´1qdqℓξpdq “ p´1qℓξpdq

in view of (2.1). Therefore, by Proposition 2.2,

a6pnq “ p´1qℓ ÿd|n , d odd

Together with Lemma 2.1 and (2.7), this implies

ξpdq.

a6pnq “ p´1qℓ`1 E1pn; 4q “ p´1qn`ℓ`1 a2pnq{4.

Finally observe that n is odd (resp. even) if ℓ is even (resp. odd). Therefore, a6pnq “
a2pnq{4.

(b) Now consider the case n ” 2 pmod 3q. We have n “ 3ℓ ` 2 for some
non-negative integer ℓ. Again the odd divisors d of n must satisfy d ” 1, 5, 7, 11
pmod 12q since they are not divisible by 3. Consequently, as above,

´ d˙ “ ξp2nd ´ dq “ ξp6dℓ ` 3dq “ p´1qℓξp3dq.

By Lemma 2.1 and (2.7), we obtain

d

ξˆ2n
a6pnq “ p´1qℓ ÿd|n , d odd

ξp3dq

“ p´1qℓ`1 2E1pn; 4q “ p´1qn`ℓ`1 a2pnq{2.

Since n and ℓ are of the same parity, we have a6pnq “ ´a2pnq{2.

(c) Finally we consider the case when n is divisible by 3. We write n “ 3Nm,
where m is coprime to 3 and N ě 1. Any odd divisor d of n is of the form d “ 3r s
for some odd divisor s of m and 0 ď r ď N. Since m and its divisors s are not
divisible by 3 and since s is odd, we again have s ” 1, 5, 7 or 11 pmod 12q. Recall
that for such s we have s2 ” 1 pmod 12q. Thus, for d “ 3r s, we obtain

2n
d

´ d ”`2 ¨ 3N´rm ´ 3r˘ s

pmod 12q.

If r “ 0, then 2n{d ´ d ” p6 ¨ 3N´1m ´ 1qs pmod 12q. Therefore,

ξˆ2n

d

´ d˙ “ ξ`p6 ¨ 3N´1m ´ 1qs˘ “ p´1qmξp´sq “ p´1qm´1ξpsq.

in view of (2.1).

If 0 ă r ă N, then 2n{d ´ d ” p6 ¨ 3N´r´1m ´ 3rqs pmod 12q. Therefore,

ξˆ2n

´ d˙ “ ξ`p6 ¨ 3N´r´1m ´ 3rqs˘ “ p´1qm ξp´3r sq “ p´1qm´1 ξp3r sq.

Now, 3r ” 3 pmod 12q if r is odd, and 3r ” ´3 if r ą 0 is even. Then by (2.1),

d

ξˆ2n

d

´ d˙ “ p´1qm´r ξp3sq.

CHRISTIAN KASSEL AND CHRISTOPHE REUTENAUER

Now consider the case r “ N. If N is odd, then 3N ” 3 pmod 12q and

ξˆ2n

d

´ d˙ “ ξ`p2m ´ 3Nqs˘ “ ξpp2m ´ 3qsq.

Now, if m is odd, then m ” 1, 5, 7 or 11 pmod 12q. We have 2m ´ 3 ” 7 or 11
pmod 12q and the multiplication by 7 or by 11 exchanges the sets t1, 5u and t7, 11u.
Since by (2.2) ξ takes opposite values on such sets, we have ξpp2m´3qsq “ ´ξpsq.
Consequently, ξp2n{d ´ dq “ ´ξpsq when m is odd.

If m is even, then m ” 2, 4, 8 or 10 pmod 12q. Then 2m ´ 3 ” 1 or 5 pmod 12q.
The multiplication by 1 or by 5 preserves each set t1, 5u and t7, 11u, so that by (2.2)
we have ξpp2m ´ 3qsq “ ξpsq. In conclusion,

ξp2n{d ´ dq “ p´1qm ξpsq

when r “ N is odd.

If r “ N is even, then 3N ” ´3 pmod 12q and ξp2n{d ´ dq “ ξpp2m ´ 3Nqsq “
ξpp2m ` 3qsq. A reasoning as in the odd N case shows that when N is even we have

ξp2n{d ´ dq “ p´1qm´1 ξpsq.

We can now compute a6pnq. We start with the case of odd N. Putting the above

information together, we obtain
