SCATTERING FOR A 3D COUPLED NONLINEAR SCHR ¨ODINGER

SYSTEM

LUIZ G. FARAH AND ADEMIR PASTOR

Abstract. We consider the three-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger system

(i∂tu + ∆u + (|u|2 + β|v|2)u = 0,

i∂tv + ∆v + (|v|2 + β|u|2)v = 0.

Let (P, Q) be any ground state solution of the above Schr¨odinger system. We show
that for any initial data (u0, v0) in H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) satisfying M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0) <
M (P, Q)A(P, Q) and M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) < M (P, Q)E(P, Q), where M (u, v) and E(u, v)
are the mass and energy (invariant quantities) associated to the system, the correspond-
ing solution is global in H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) and scatters. Our approach is in the same
spirit of Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko [6], where the authors considered the 3D cubic
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.

This work is concerned with the following Cauchy problem associated with a three-

is a real coupling parameter. The system appears, for instance, in the propagation of laser
beams in birefringent Kerr medium in nonlinear optics (see [2]). Besides, a large quantity
of nonlinear physical phenomena can be modelled using the system of equations in (1.1),
which we refrain from list them here (see e.g., [1], [2], and references therein).

Our main interest here concerns the behavior of the solutions of (1.1). Let us start by

observing that the system conserves the quantities

E(u0, v0), for all t ∈ I. The invariants (1.2)-(1.4) are the so called mass, momentum, and
energy. In order to simplify notation, we also deﬁne

L. G. FARAH AND A. PASTOR

The system (1.1) enjoys a scaling invariance symmetry, which says that if (u, v) is a

solution of (1.1), then

uλ(x, t) = λu(λx, λ2t),

vλ(x, t) = λv(λx, λ2t),

(1.6)

is also a solution with initial data(cid:0)λu0(λx), λv0(λx)(cid:1), for any λ > 0. A simple computation

reveals that

kuλ(·, 0)k ˙H 1/2 + kvλ(·, 0)k ˙H 1/2 = ku0k ˙H 1/2 + kv0k ˙H 1/2 ,

where ˙H 1/2 = ˙H 1/2(R3) is the homogeneous L2-based Sobolev space of order 1/2 (see
˙H 1/2(R3) × ˙H 1/2(R3) is the scale-invariant
notations below for the deﬁnition). Thus,
Sobolev space for system (1.1). Such a space is, therefore, called critical space.
It is easy to see that the quantities M (u, v)E(u, v) and M (u, v)A(u, v) are also in-
variant under the same scaling, indeed M (uλ, vλ)E(uλ, vλ) = M (u, v)E(u, v) and also
M (uλ, vλ)A(uλ, vλ) = M (u, v)A(u, v). In particular, we have

Another invariance associated with (1.1) is the so called Galilean invariance, that is, if

M (uλ, vλ) =

1
λ

M (u, v).

(1.7)

(u, v) is a solution then, for any ξ0 ∈ R3,

(ei(x·ξ0−t|ξ|2)u(x − 2tξ0, t), ei(x·ξ0−t|ξ|2)v(x − 2tξ0, t))

(1.8)

is also a solution with initial data (eix·ξ0u0(x), eix·ξ0v0(x)).

The system (1.1) has some very special solutions. Indeed, if we look for solutions of the

form

(u(x, t), v(x, t)) = (eitP (x), eitQ(x))

then (P, Q) must solve the following 3D elliptic system:

(−∆P + P − (|P|2 + β|Q|2)P = 0,
−∆Q + Q − (|Q|2 + β|P|2)Q = 0.

(1.9)

A nontrivial solution (P, Q) 6= (0, 0) which has the least energy level is commonly
refereed to as a ground state solution. The existence of positive, radially symmetric,
ground state solutions for (1.9) was studied, for instance, by Maia-Montefusco-Pellacci
[19]. Such a solution plays a crucial role in our further analysis (threshold for global
existence and blow up of the solution). Throughout the paper (P, Q) always will denote
the ground state solution of (1.9). Although uniqueness of the ground state is not known
for any β (see [25]), this will not be an issue to our purpose (see also our Remark 3.2
below).

A local well-posedness result for (1.1) can be established by combining the well-known
Strichatz estimates (see Lemma 2.1 below) with the contraction mapping principle (see
[4]). In addition, such a local solution can be extended globally in time, if one impose
some additional condition on the initial data. More precisely, in [22] the second author
obtained the following global well-posedness result (see [10] and [11] for the similar result
concerning the NLS equation).
Theorem 1.1. Let (u, v) ∈ C((−T∗, T ∗); H 1(R3) × H 1(R3)) be the solution of (1.1) with
initial data (u0, v0) ∈ H 1(R3)×H 1(R3), where I := (−T∗, T ∗) is the maximal time interval
of existence. Assume that

M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) < M (P, Q)E(P, Q).

(1.10)

If

then

M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q),

M (u(t), v(t))A(u(t), v(t)) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q)

and the solution exists globally in time, that is, I = (−∞,∞).
Remark 1.2. Note that under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, we also have

in view of (1.12) and the fact that the mass is conserved.

(u, v) ∈ L∞(R; H 1(R3) × H 1(R3)),

3

(1.11)

(1.12)

Remark 1.3. It was also proved in [22, Theorem 1.2] that if u0 and v0 are radial func-
tions satisfying M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) < M (P, Q)E(P, Q) and also M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0) >
M (P, Q)A(P, Q) then the solution blows up in ﬁnite time.

Our goal in the present work is to show that under the assumptions (1.10) and (1.11)
the global solution (u(t), v(t)) given in Theorem 1.1 scatters in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.4
below. In what follows, we denote by eit∆ the unitary group associated with the linear
Schr¨odinger equation iut + ∆u = 0.

Deﬁnition 1.4. We say that a global solution (u(t), v(t)) scatters forward in time if there
exist φ+, ψ+ ∈ H 1(R3) such that

lim

t→+∞k(u(t), v(t)) − (eit∆φ+, eit∆ψ+)kH 1×H 1 = 0.

Also, we say that (u(t), v(t)) scatters backward in time if there exist φ−, ψ− ∈ H 1(R3)
such that

t→−∞k(u(t), v(t)) − (eit∆φ−, eit∆ψ−)kH 1×H 1 = 0.

The main result of our study is the following one.

Theorem 1.5. Assume that (u0, v0) ∈ K, where

K :=(cid:8)(u0, v0) ∈ H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) : relations (1.10) and (1.11) hold(cid:9) .

Then the corresponding solution (u(t), v(t)) of system (1.1) exists globally in time and
scatters both forward and backward in time.

Our strategy to prove Theorem 1.5 is to adapt the ideas of Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko
[6] (see also [10]), where the authors considered the 3D cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. It worth mentioning that the core of the approach in [6] was prior introduced by
Kenig-Merle [13] in the study of the energy-critical Schr¨odinger equation. To the best of
our knowledge, our paper is the ﬁrst one to deal with these techniques in order to show
scattering for coupled systems of nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations under the conditions
given in Theorem 1.1 (see (1.10)-(1.11) and also Remark 1.3). For the sake of simplicity,
we will only prove scattering forward in time; the case of backward in time follows the
same plan.

It should be noted that, by using a diﬀerent approach, scattering for (1.1) has appeared
Indeed,

in Xu [26]. However, as we describe below our result extend the one in [26].
consider the functionals

J(u, v) =

2ZR3

Also, let

J0 := infnJ(u, v) : (u, v) ∈ H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) \ {(0, 0)}, K(u, v) = 0o ≡ J(P, Q) > 0

and deﬁne the sets

K + = {(u, v) ∈ H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) : J(u, v) < J0, K(u, v) ≥ 0}
K− = {(u, v) ∈ H 1(R3) × H 1(R3 : J(u, v) < J0, K(u, v) < 0}.

The author in [26] then showed if (u0, v0) ∈ K +, then the corresponding solution is global
and scatters. Also, if (u0, v0) ∈ K− is radial or (xu0, xv0) ∈ L2(R3) × L2(R3), then the
solution blows up in ﬁnite time. In particular, his result establishes scattering only for
initial data in K +. However, as we show in our Appendix,

by proving that the set where we have scattering is larger than the one obtained in [26].

At least from the mathematical point of view, system (1.1) can be generalized to

K +   K,

(1.15)



i∂tu + ∆u + µ(|u|2p + β|u|p−1|v|p+1)u = 0,
i∂tv + ∆v + µ(|v|2p + β|u|p+1|v|p−1)v = 0,
u(x, 0) = u0(x),

v(x, 0) = v0(x),

(1.16)

where (x, t) ∈ Rn × R, u = u(x, t), v = v(x, t), p > 1, and µ = 1 (focusing case) or µ = −1
(defocusing case). A global well-posedness for (1.16) in the focusing case, in the same
spirit of Theorem 1.1, was established in [15]. The sharp threshold for the global existence
now depends on the ground state solutions of the elliptic system associated with (1.16).
The interested reader will also ﬁnd some related work in [5], [17], [18], [21], [23], [24], and
references therein. We believe that our results in Theorem 1.5 can also be generalized to
this case. A possible approach to obtain the results could be to extend the results in [8]
and [9], where the authors dealt with the multi-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with a
power-law nonlinearity. This will be issue for further investigation.

In the defocusing case, scattering theory for (1.16) has already been established in
[3]. The approach is completely diﬀerent from ours; most of the arguments are based
on Morawetz-type identities and inequalities and the corresponding Morawetz estimates.
In that case, all solutions with initial data in H 1(R3) × H 1(R3) are global and scatters
forward and backward in time.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce some notation and recall
the Strichartz estimates for the Schr¨odinger equation.
In Section 3, we ﬁrst recall the
sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality; which is fundamental to obtain our results. In the
sequel we recall and prove some results concerning the Cauchy problem (1.1). In particular
a small data global result and a long time perturbation theory are established. Also, we
recall a suﬃcient condition for proving the scattering.
In Section 4, we establish the
proﬁle and energy decomposition of bounded sequences in H 1(R3). In particular, in the
proﬁle decomposition, we show that space and time shifts can be taken to be the same
for two distinct sequences. The proof Theorem 1.5 is essentially initiated in Section 5,

where we reformulate the conclusion in an equivalent way and prove the existence of the
so called critical solution. In Section 6, we complete the proof of Theorem 1.5, by showing
a Liouville-type theorem and concluding that the critical solution constructed previously
cannot exist.

2. Notations and Preliminaries

Let us start this section by introducing the notation used throughout the paper. We
use c to denote various constants that may vary line by line. For any positive quantities a
and b, the notation a . b means that a ≤ cb, with c uniform with respect to the set where
a and b vary. Given a complex number z, we use Re(z) and Im(z) to denote, respectively,

the real and imaginary parts of z. Otherwise is stated,R f always mean integration of the

3. Energy Inequalities and the Cauchy Problem

In this section we will provide the basic results concerning the Cauchy problem (1.1) we
need. To begin with, we will establish some useful energy inequalities. First of all, recall
the sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality.
Lemma 3.1. For any (u, v) ∈ H 1 × H 1 there holds

where the sharp constant KGN is given by

≡ KGN M (u, v)1/2A(u, v)3/2,

KGN =

4

3M (P, Q)1/2A(P, Q)1/2

(3.2)

and (P, Q) is any ground state solution of the elliptic system (1.9).

Proof. See [7, Section 3] and [22, Proposition 2.3].

Remark 3.2. It can be shown that the sharp constant in (3.2) is given by

KGN =

4

3√3m

,

7

(cid:3)

(3.3)

where m is the inﬁmum, on the Nehari manifold, of the Lagrangian associated with (1.9).
In particular, this shows that KGN does not depend on the choice of the ground state
solution. Also, using a Pohozaev-type identity, it is not diﬃcult to see that (see e.g., [22])

KGN =

4

3√6M (P, Q)1/2E(P, Q)1/2

.

(3.4)

All together, relations (3.2)-(3.4), imply that the quantities M (P, Q)E(P, Q) and also
M (P, Q)A(P, Q), appearing on the right-hand side of (1.10) and (1.11), do not depend on
the choice of the ground state solution.
Lemma 3.3. Assume that (u, v) ∈ H 1 × H 1 satisﬁes M (u, v)A(u, v) ≤ M (P, Q)A(P, Q).
Then, the following statements hold.

1

A(u, v).

(i) E(u, v) ≥
(ii) M (u, v)A(u, v) ≤

M (u, v)E(u, v)

M (P, Q)A(P, Q).

(iii) S(u, v) ≥ 8A(u, v) 1 −(cid:18) M (u, v)E(u, v)

M (P, Q)E(P, Q)(cid:19)1/2!, where

S(u, v) = 8A(u, v) − 6(kuk4

Proof. From Lemma 3.1,

E(u, v) ≥

A(u, v) −

KGN M (u, v)1/2A(u, v)3/2.

Multiplying this last inequality by M (u, v) yields

For x > 0, function f has a unique critical point at

x0 =

= M (P, Q)1/2A(P, Q)1/2.

It is easily seen that, on (0, x0),

f (x) ≥

In addition, f is increasing on (0, x0) and decreasing on (x0, +∞). Thus, since the

hypothesis implies M (u, v)1/2A(u, v)1/2 ≤ x0, we obtain
M (u, v)E(u, v) ≥ f(cid:16)M (u, v)1/2A(u, v)1/2(cid:17) ≥

This proves part (i) of the lemma. From (3.9) and (3.7), we have

M (P, Q)E(P, Q) =

which together with (3.6) and (3.8) imply part (ii). Finally, we note from Lemma 3.1 and

This establishes part (iii) and completes the proof of Lemma 3.3.

(cid:3)

In view of the above lemma and the global result stated in Theorem 1.1 we have the

following small data global theory in H 1 × H 1.
Corollary 3.4 (Small data global theory in H 1 × H 1). There exists δsd > 0 such that if
(u0, v0) ∈ H 1 × H 1 satisﬁes

k(u0, v0)kH 1×H 1 ≤ δsd

then the solution (u, v) of the initial value problem (1.1) is globally deﬁned in H 1 × H 1.
In addition there exists Csd > 0 such that
k(u, v)kL∞

t (H 1×H 1) ≤ Csdδsd.

(3.10)

Proof. For simplicity in this proof we use the equivalent norm in H 1 given by

Therefore,

H 1 = ku0k2

k(u0, v0)k2
Furthermore, it is easy to see that

H 1×H 1 = M (u0, v0) + A(u0, v0).

(3.11)

and

M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0) ≤ k(u0, v0)k2

H 1×H 1

M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) ≤

M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0).

So, there exists δsd > 0 suﬃciently small such that if k(u0, v0)kH 1×H 1 ≤ δsd then the
relations (1.10) and (1.11) are satisﬁed.
In view of Theorem 1.1, the solution (u, v) of
the initial value problem (1.1) is global and, since M (u, v) and E(u, v) are conserved
quantities,

and

M (u(t), v(t))E(u(t), v(t)) ≤

M (u(t), v(t))A(u(t), v(t)) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q).

(3.12)

Finally, since the mass M (u(t), v(t)) is preserved, we deduce (possibly changing the
constant Csd) (3.10) from (3.11) and (3.12). This completes the proof of Corollary 3.4. (cid:3)
Next we recall the small data global theory in the critical Sobolev space ˙H 1/2 × ˙H 1/2,
the H 1-scattering criterion and the existence of wave operators obtained by the second
author in [22].
Theorem 3.5 (Small data global theory in ˙H 1/2 × ˙H 1/2). Let A > 0 and assume that
(u0, v0) ∈ ˙H 1/2 × ˙H 1/2 satisﬁes k(u0, v0)k ˙H 1/2× ˙H 1/2 ≤ A. There is δ > 0 such that if

k(eit∆u0, eit∆v0)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) ≤ δ,

then the initial value problem (1.1) is globally well-posed in ˙H 1/2 × ˙H 1/2. In addition there
exists c > 0 such that

and

k(u, v)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) ≤ 2k(eit∆u0, eit∆v0)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2)

k(D1/2u, D1/2v)kS(L2)×S(L2) ≤ 2ck(u0, v0)k ˙H 1/2× ˙H 1/2.

Proof. See [22, Theorem 4.1].

(cid:3)

The next result gives a suﬃcient condition for a uniformly bounded global solution in

H 1 × H 1 scatters.
Theorem 3.6 (H 1 scattering). Let (u0, v0) ∈ H 1 × H 1. Suppose that the initial value
problem (1.1) is globally well-posed in H 1×H 1 with B := sup
t∈Rk(u(t), v(t))kH 1×H 1 < ∞ and
< ∞. Then the solution (u(t), v(t)) scatters forward and backward
K := kukL5
in time in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.4.

+ kvkL5

x,t

Proof. Assuming that

sup

t∈[0,+∞)k(u(t), v(t))kH 1×H 1 < ∞ the forward scattering was proved

in [22, Theorem 1.3]. The same argument can be applied to prove backward scattering if
we suppose
(cid:3)

sup

t∈(−∞,0]k(u(t), v(t))kH 1×H 1 < ∞.

Note that (5, 5) is an ˙H 1/2 admissible pair. A simple inspection in the proof of The-
orem 1.3 in [22] reveals that it still holds if we replace (5, 5) by any ˙H 1/2 admissible
pair. In particular, a suﬃcient condition for scattering is the ﬁniteness of the quantity
k(u, v)kS( ˙H 1/2× ˙H 1/2).
Theorem 3.7 (Existence of wave operators). Assume φ+, ψ+ ∈ H 1 and

(3.13)
Then, there exists (u0, v0) ∈ H 1×H 1 such that the solution (u(t), v(t)) of (1.1) with initial
condition (u0, v0) exists globally and satisﬁes

M (φ+, ψ+)A(φ+, ψ+) < M (P, Q)E(P, Q).

Proof. See [22, Theorem 1.4].
(cid:3)
Remark 3.8. A similar result backward in time also holds assuming that φ−, ψ− ∈ H 1
satisfy (3.13) and the limit is taken as t → −∞.

Next, we prove a so called long time perturbation result. This will be necessary in the

construction of the critical solution below.

Proposition 3.9 (Long time perturbation theory). Given any A > 0, there are ε > 0
and C > 0, depending only on A, such that the following statement holds. Assume that

(u, v) ∈ C([t0,∞); H 1 × H 1) is a solution of (1.1) and (eu,ev) ∈ C([t0,∞); H 1 × H 1) satisfy

(3.16)

(i∂teu + ∆eu + (|eu|2 + β|ev|2)eu = e1,
i∂tev + ∆ev + (|ev|2 + β|eu|2)ev = e2,

for suitable functions e1 and e2. If

k(eu,ev)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) ≤ A,

k(ei(t−t0)∆(u(t0) −eu(t0)), ei(t−t0 )∆(v(t0) −ev(t0)))kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) ≤ ε,

k(e1, e2)kS ′( ˙H −1/2)×S ′( ˙H −1/2) ≤ ε,

k(u −eu, v −ev)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) ≤ Cε.
Proof. Deﬁne w = u −eu and z = v −ev. Then, w and z satisfy
(i∂tw + ∆w + f1 + e1 = 0,

i∂tz + ∆z + f2 + e2 = 0,

then

with

f1 = |u|2u + β|v|2u − |eu|2eu − β|ev|2eu,

f2 = |v|2v + β|u|2v − |ev|2ev − β|eu|2ev.

Now we can take a partition of the interval [t0,∞) into N subintervals (with the number N

depending only on A) of the form Ij = [tj, tj+1], j = 0, . . . , N − 1, such thatkeukS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) +
kevkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) ≤ δ, where δ > 0 will be appropriately chosen later. Since
N−1Xj=0(cid:0)kwkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) + kzkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij)(cid:1),

kwkS( ˙H 1/2) + kzkS( ˙H 1/2) ≤

it is suﬃcient to show that, for j = 0, . . . , N − 1,

kwkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) + kzkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) ≤ Cε.

On the other hand, recall that solving (3.19) is equivalent to (Φ(w), Ψ(z)) = (w, z),
where Φ(w) and Ψ(z) are the right-hand side of (3.21) and (3.22), respectively. Thus, in
view of (3.27), one sees

kΦ(w)kS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) + kΨ(z)kS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) ≤Aj + cε + c(cid:16)kwkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij) + kzkS( ˙H 1/2;Ij)(cid:17)3

Assume that

With these choice, it is easy to see that the right-hand side of (3.28) is bounded by a
provided (w, z) belongs to Ba. The ﬁxed point theorem then gives
k(w, z)kS( ˙H 1/2;Ij)×S( ˙H 1/2;Ij) ≤ 2k(ei(t−tj )∆w(tj), ei(t−tj )∆z(tj))kS( ˙H 1/2;Ij)×S( ˙H 1/2;Ij) + 2cε

Now we proceed as follows. By taking t = tj+1 in the integral equations above and

applying ei(t−tj+1)∆, we obtain

ei(t−tj+1)∆w(tj+1) = ei(t−tj )∆w(tj) + iZ tj+1

arguments to show that

kei(t−tj+1)∆w(tj+1)kS( ˙H 1/2) + kei(t−tj+1)∆z(tj+1)kS( ˙H 1/2)

Since (3.32) implies the second assumption in (3.29) it suﬃces to show (3.32). Using (3.33)
and iterating, one deduces

kei(t−tj )∆w(tj )kS( ˙H 1/2) + kei(t−tj )∆z(tj)kS( ˙H 1/2)

4. Profile and Energy decomposition

In this section we ﬁrst prove a proﬁle expansion for two bounded sequences in H 1(R3) in
the spirit of Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko [6] (see also Keraani [14]). The main point in
our result is that the space and time shifts, xj
n, are the same for both sequences. We
point out that our proof can be adapted to obtain a similar result for any ﬁnite quantities
of bounded sequences.

by {φn} and {eφn}, respectively, and
(i) for each 1 ≤ j ≤ M , there are proﬁles {ψj} and {eψj} in H 1,
(ii) for each 1 ≤ j ≤ M , there exists a sequence of time shifts {tj

The induction assumption then yields (4.3) at rank M . One proves (4.4) in a similar
manner.

In order to show that (4.1) holds we need the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let {tn} ⊂ R and {xn} ⊂ R3 be two sequences.

(i) If

lim
n→∞

(|tn| + |xn|) = ∞,

(4.14)

then, for any ψ ∈ H 1,

(ii) If {zn} ⊂ H 1 is such that
and

in H 1.

for some ψ ∈ H 1 \ {0}, then (4.14) holds.

eitn∆zn(· + xn) ⇀ ψ,

in H 1,

Proof. See Lemma 5.3 in [8].

(cid:3)

Now let us prove that (4.1) holds at rank M . First of all, note that (4.13) implies that

either ψM or eψM is nontrivial. Let us suppose, without loss of generality, that ψM 6= 0.

Assume by induction that (4.1) holds for j, k ∈ {1, . . . , M − 1}. Under the convention
W 0

n = φn, note that, for all (ﬁxed) j ∈ {1, . . . , M − 1},

Part (i) of Lemma 4.2 implies that the right-hand side of (4.15) converges weakly to 0 in
H 1. Thus, since eitj

This proves (4.1) at rank M .

Finally, let us prove (4.2). If AM0 = 0 for some M0 ≥ 1, according to the construction,
there is nothing to prove. Assume that AM > 0 for all M ≥ 1. Let (q, r) be any ˙H 1/2
admissible pair. The inequality (4.5) and Lemma 2.1 (i) imply that

5. Construction of a critical solution

In this section we will construct a critical solution. We follow the exposition in Holmer-
Roudenko [10] (see also Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko [6] and Fang-Xie-Cazenave [8]),
which was based in the ideas introduced by Kenig-Merle [13]. We start with the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Suppose (u0, v0) ∈ H 1 × H 1 and let (u, v) be the corresponding H 1-
solution to the three-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger system (1.1). Let [0, T ∗) be
the maximal forward interval of existence. We shall say that SC(u0, v0) holds if

T ∗ = ∞ and

k(u, v)kS( ˙H 1/2 )×S( ˙H 1/2) < ∞.

Our goal is to show that SC(u0, v0) holds for any (u0, v0) ∈ K. We already know from
Theorem 1.1 that, for any (u0, v0) ∈ K, T ∗ = ∞ and the solution (u, v) is uniformly
bounded in H 1 × H 1 (see Remark 1.2). Moreover, as we already observed, if kukS( ˙H 1/2) +
kvkS( ˙H 1/2) < ∞ then Proposition 3.6 implies that (u, v) scatters. Let

L :=n(u0, v0) ∈ K : k(u, v)kS( ˙H 1/2 )×S( ˙H 1/2) < ∞o .

With these remarks, we want to show that

L = K.

Let Mc be the number deﬁned as the supremum over all δ for which the following state-

ment holds:

“If (u0, v0) ∈ H 1 × H 1 satisﬁes (1.11) and M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) < δ then SC(u0, v0)

holds.”

20

L. G. FARAH AND A. PASTOR

Note that there always exists a δ > 0 such that the above statement is true. Indeed, if

M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0) < δ, by interpolation and Lemma 3.3 (i), we have

ku0k4

˙H 1/2 + kv0k4

L2kv0k2

L2

< M (u0, v0)A(u0, v0)
≤ 6M (u0, v0)E(u0, v0)
< 6δ.

Lemma 2.1 (i) now implies that k(eit∆u0, eit∆v0)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) is suﬃciently small. There-
fore, the small data global theory (Theorem 3.5) asserts that for a small enough δ > 0 we
have a global solution that scatters.

Our purpose here is then to show that Mc ≥ M (P, Q)E(P, Q). Assume, by contradic-
tion, that Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q). Therefore, there exists a sequence of solutions (un, vn)
of system (1.1) with corresponding initial data (un,0, vn,0) such that (un,0, vn,0) ∈ K and

for which SC(un,0, vn,0) does not hold for any n ∈ N. As a consequence, we have

M (un, vn)E(un, vn) ց Mc,

as n → ∞,

k(un, vn)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) = ∞,

for any n ∈ N.

(5.1)

Our main goal in this section is to apply the proﬁle decomposition result stated in
Theorem 4.1 to construct a critical solution that does not scatters. Indeed, by the scaling
symmetry (1.6) (see also (1.7)) we can re-scale the sequence described before such that
M (un,0, vn,0) = 1, for any n ∈ N. In this case we have

A(un,0, vn,0) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q)

and

(5.2)
In view of the assumption Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q), without loss of generality, there exists

E(un, vn) ց Mc,

as n → ∞.

δ ∈ (0, 1) such that, for every n ∈ N,

E(un, vn) ≤ δM (P, Q)E(P, Q).

Since (un,0, vn,0) ∈ K, relation (1.11) is satisﬁed, for any n ∈ N, which implies by Lemma
3.3 (ii) that
(5.3)
Therefore, {un,0}n∈N and {vn,0}n∈N are two uniformly bounded sequences in H 1 and we
can apply the proﬁle expansion (Theorem 4.1) to obtain

A(un,0, vn,0) ≤ δM (P, Q)A(P, Q).

Moreover, another application of (4.3) and (4.4), with s = 1, and (5.3), yield

Proof. Assume that (ψj,eψj ) 6= (0, 0) for j ∈ J, where J ⊂ N has more than one element.

In view of (5.5), for any j ∈ J,

Finally, taking ε = ε(A) we can ﬁnd M0(ε(A)), n0(ε(A)) ∈ N such that (5.23) holds.
Thus setting n3 = max{n0(ε(A)), n1(M0), n2(M0)} in view of (5.23)-(5.24), we can apply
the long time perturbation theory (Proposition 3.9) to deduce

k(un, vn)kS( ˙H 1/2)×S( ˙H 1/2) < ∞,

for every n ≥ n3, a contradiction with (5.1).

Now we have all tools to prove the existence of a critical solution.

(5.30)

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.3 (Existence of a critical solution). If Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q), there exists
(uc,0, vc,0) ∈ H 1 × H 1 such that the corresponding solution (uc, vc) of the system (1.1) is
global in H 1 × H 1 with
(i) M (uc, vc) = 1;
(ii) E(uc, vc) = Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q);
(iii) M (uc, vc)A(uc, vc) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q);
(iv) kuckS( ˙H 1/2) + kvckS( ˙H 1/2) = ∞.

Proof. Let {(un,0, vn,0)}n∈N ⊂ H 1 × H 1 be the sequence constructed in the introduction
of this section and let {(ψj ,eψj)}j∈N ⊂ H 1 × H 1 be the sequence constructed in Lemma
5.2. In view of Lemma 5.2 we can assume, without loss of generality, that (ψ1,eψ1) 6= (0, 0)
and (ψj,eψj ) = (0, 0), for all j ≥ 2. For simplicity we omit the index 1 in what follows.
Using the same argument as the one in the previous case, we can ﬁnd (η,eη) ∈ H 1 × H 1

such that

(5.31)

M (η,eη) = M (ψ,eψ) ≤ 1,
M (η,eη)A(η,eη) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q),

Let (uc, vc) be the solution of (1.1) with initial data (η,eη), that is,
Since (η,eη) satisﬁes conditions (1.10) and (1.11), by Theorem 1.1, the solution (5.37) exists

(uc(t), vc(t)) = NLSs(t)(η,eη).

globally and inequality (iii) in the statement of Theorem 5.3 holds.

We claim that

(5.37)

(5.38)
Indeed, suppose that kuckS( ˙H 1/2) + kvckS( ˙H 1/2) < ∞. The idea is to use the long time

perturbation theory to obtain a contradiction. If we deﬁne

then

(eun(t),evn(t)) = NLSs(t − tn)(η,eη)(· − xn),

(5.39)

Moreover, if (un(t), vn(t)) = NLSs(t)(un,0, vn,0), then by (5.36) and (5.39),

keunkS( ˙H 1/2) + keunkS( ˙H 1/2) = kuckS( ˙H 1/2) + kvckS( ˙H 1/2) < ∞.

= keit∆K M

n kS( ˙H 1/2) → 0,

as M, n → ∞,

n kS( ˙H 1/2) + keit∆eK M

where in the last line we have used the limit (5.35). Therefore, applying Proposition 3.9
with e = 0, we obtain kunkS( ˙H 1/2) + kvnkS( ˙H 1/2) < ∞, for n ∈ N large enough, which is a
contradiction with (5.1).

It remains to prove that

M (uc, vc) = 1

and E(uc, vc) = Mc.

(5.40)

By (5.32) and the deﬁnition of Mc we have M (uc, vc)E(uc, vc) = Mc, otherwise we cannot
have (5.38). Thus, inequalities (5.31) and (5.33) imply (5.40), which completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Next, we show that the ﬂow associated to the critical solution (uc, vc) given by Theorem
5.3 enjoys some compactness properties up to a continuous shift x(t) in space. More
speciﬁcally we have the following proposition.

Proposition 5.4 (Precompactness of the critical ﬂow). Let (uc, vc) be the critical solution
constructed in Theorem 5.3, then there exists a continuous path x ∈ C([0,∞); R3) such
that the set

B := {(uc(· − x(t), t), vc(· − x(t), t)) : t ≥ 0} ⊂ H 1 × H 1

is precompact in H 1 × H 1.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.2 in [6]. So, we only give the main
steps. In H 1 × H 1 we let G ≃ R3 act as a translation group, that is,

x0 · (f1, f2) = (f1(· − x0), f2(· − x0)).

Thus, in the quotient space G \ H 1 × H 1 we can introduce the metric

d([f1, f2], [g1, g2]) := inf

x0∈R3 k(f1(· − x0), f2(· − x0)) − (g1, g2)kH 1×H 1,

in such a way that the proof of the proposition is equivalent to establish that the set

is precompact in G\H 1×H 1, where π : H 1×H 1 → G\H 1×H 1 is the standard projection.

C := π({(uc(t), vc(t)), t ≥ 0})

28

L. G. FARAH AND A. PASTOR

Now assume, by contradiction, that C is not precompact in G\ H 1 × H 1. Then, we can

ﬁnd a sequence ([uc(tn), vc(tn)])n∈N and ε > 0 such that

inf

x0∈R3 k(uc(· − x0, tn), vc(· − x0, tn)) − (uc(·, tm), vc(·, tm))kH 1×H 1 > ε,

(5.41)

for all m, n ∈ N with m 6= n. To obtain a contradiction with (5.41), it suﬃces to prove
that a subsequence of (uc(tn), vc(tn)) converges in H 1 × H 1.
Since (uc(tn), vc(tn)) is bounded in H 1 × H 1, we apply Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 5.2 to
write

(uc(tn), vc(tn)) = (e−it1

n∆ψ1(· − x1

It remains to show that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (5.42) converges. To this
end, it suﬃces to show that {t1

does not converge, we can apply the small data global theory to obtain a contradiction as
in [10, Proposition 5.5] and [26, Proposition 6.2].
(cid:3)

n )kH 1×H 1 = 0.

As a consequence of the previous proposition we obtain the following uniform localiza-

tion of the ﬂow.
Corollary 5.5 (Uniform localization). Let (u, v) be a solution of (1.1) and x ∈ C([0,∞); R3)
a continuous path such that

B = {(u(· − x(t), t), v(· − x(t), t)) : t ≥ 0}

is precompact in H 1 × H 1. Then for every ε > 0 there exists R > 0 so that

Z|x+x(t)|>R(cid:0)|∇u|2 + |∇v|2 + |u|2 + |v|2 + |u|4 + 2β|uv|2 + |v|4(cid:1) dx < ε,

for every t ≥ 0.
Proof. Indeed, otherwise, there exist ε > 0 and a sequence {tn}, such that for any R > 0
(after a change variables)

Z|x|>R(cid:0)|∇u|2 + |∇v|2 + |u|2 + |v|2 + |u|4 + 2β|uv|2 + |v|4(cid:1) (x − x(tn), tn)dx ≥ ε.

The precompactness of B implies the existence of (φ, ψ) ∈ H 1 × H 1 such that (u(· −
x(tn), tn), v(· − x(tn), tn)) converges to (φ, ψ). Passing to the limit in the last inequality,
we deduce

Z|x|>R(cid:0)|∇φ|2 + |∇ψ|2 + |φ|2 + |ψ|2 + |φ|4 + 2β|φψ|2 + |ψ|4(cid:1) (x)dx ≥ ε,

29

for any R > 0, which contradicts the fact that (φ, ψ) ∈ H 1 × H 1. The proof is thus
completed.
(cid:3)

6. Rigidity and the proof of Theorem 1.5

In this section we prove that the critical solution (uc, vc) construct in the previous

section must vanishes, which is a contradiction with

kuckS( ˙H 1/2) + kvckS( ˙H 1/2) = ∞.

Therefore we cannot have Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q), completing the proof of Theorem 1.5.
The proof is similar to that in [26, Sections 6.3-6.5], which was based on the ideas
developed in [6] in their study of the 3D cubic focusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(see also [8]). We give the details for completeness.

We start with the following lemma which asserts that the critical solution (uc, vc) has

zero momentum (recall (1.3)).

Lemma 6.1. Let (uc, vc) be the critical solution construct in Theorem 5.3, then its con-
served momentum F (uc, vc) is zero.

Proof. Since (uc, vc) is a solution of system (1.1), by the Galilean invariance (1.8), for any
ξ0 ∈ R3, we have that

(u∗c (x, t), v∗c (x, t)) ≡ (ei(x·ξ0−t|ξ|2)uc(x − 2tξ0, t), ei(x·ξ0−t|ξ|2)vc(x − 2tξ0, t))

is also a solution of (1.1). By the deﬁnition of (u∗c , v∗c ) and Theorem 5.3 (iv), it is clear
that

ku∗ckS( ˙H 1/2) + kv∗ckS( ˙H 1/2) = kuckS( ˙H 1/2) + kvckS( ˙H 1/2) = ∞.

Moreover, a simple calculation yields (recall the conserved quantities (1.2)-(1.4))

(6.1)

A(u∗c , v∗c ) = |ξ0|2M (uc, vc) + 2ξ0 · F (uc, vc) + A(uc, vc),

and thus

1
2|ξ0|2M (uc, vc) + ξ0 · F (uc, vc) + E(uc, vc).
Assume that F (uc, vc) 6= 0 and take ξ0 = −F (uc, vc)/M (uc, vc). Then,

E(u∗c , v∗c ) =

and

M (u∗c , v∗c ) = M (uc, vc), E(u∗c , v∗c ) = E(uc, vc) −

A(u∗c , v∗c ) = A(uc, vc) −

Therefore, by Theorem 5.3 (i)-(iii) we deduce

and

M (u∗c , v∗c )E(u∗c , v∗c ) < Mc < M (P, Q)E(P, Q)

M (u∗c , v∗c )A(u∗c , v∗c ) < M (P, Q)A(P, Q),

which, in view of (6.1), is a contradiction with the deﬁnition of Mc.

Next, we provide a control of the spatial translation parameter x(t) obtained in Propo-
sition 5.4. Indeed, we show that x(t) cannot grow faster then t as this parameter goes to
inﬁnity. This is the content of the following result.

30

L. G. FARAH AND A. PASTOR

Lemma 6.2. Let (uc, vc) be the (global) critical solution construct in Theorem 5.3 and
x(t) the spatial translation parameter obtained in Proposition 5.4. Then

|x(t)|

t → 0,

as

t → +∞.

(6.2)

Proof. Suppose, by contradiction, that there exist δ > 0 and a sequence tn → +∞ such
that, for all n ∈ N,

|x(tn)|

tn ≥ δ.

(6.3)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

We assume, without loss of generality, that x(0) = 0 and deﬁne

τn = inf{t ≥ 0 : |x(t)| ≥ |x(tn)|},

so that 0 ≤ τn ≤ tn and |x(t)| < |x(tn)|, for all 0 ≤ t < τn. The continuity of x(t) yields
|x(τn)| = |x(tn)| and then, by (6.3), it is clear that

|x(τn)|

τn ≥ δ,

for all n ∈ N.

(6.4)

Moreover, since tn → +∞ we have, by (6.3), x(tn) → +∞, which implies x(τn) → +∞.
Thus,

(6.5)
By the precompactness of the set B deﬁned in Proposition 5.4 and Corollary 5.5, for

as n → ∞.

τn → +∞,

every η > 0 there exists R(η) such that, for any t ≥ 0,

Z|x+x(t)|>R(η)(cid:16)|∇uc|2 + |∇vc|2 + |uc|2 + |vc|2 + |uc|4 + 2β|ucvc|2 + |vc|4(cid:17)dx < η.

Now, let θ ∈ C∞0 ([0,∞)) be a real-valued function such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, kθ′kL∞ ≤ 2,

θ(r) = 1, if 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 and θ(r) = 0, if r ≥ 2, and deﬁne the truncated center of mass

zRn(t) =Z xθ(cid:18) |x|

Rn(cid:19) (|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx,

where

Rn = R(η) + |x(τn)|.

We ﬁrst obtain an upper bound for zRn(0) and a lower bound for zRn (τn). Indeed, in

view of (6.6), we have (recall that x(0) = 0)

|zRn(0)| ≤Z|x|≤R(η) |x|θ(cid:18) |x|

Rn(cid:19) (|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

+Z|x+x(0)|>R(η) |x|θ(cid:18) |x|

Rn(cid:19) (|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

≤R(η)M (uc, vc) + 2Rnη,

where in the last line we have also used the fact that

|xθ (|x|/R) | ≤ 2R,

for all R > 0.

(6.9)

(6.10)

31

On the other hand,

zRn(τn) =Z|x+x(τn)|>R(η)
+Z|x+x(τn)|≤R(η)

xθ(cid:18) |x|
Rn(cid:19) (|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx
Rn(cid:19) (|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx
xθ(cid:18) |x|

≡ I + II.

Again using (6.6) and (6.10), we can estimate I by
|I| ≤ 2Rnη.

To estimate II, we ﬁrst note that if |x + x(τn)| ≤ R(η) then |x| ≤ |x + x(τn)| + |x(τn)| ≤
R(η) + |x(τn)| = Rn, which implies θ (|x|/Rn) | = 1. Therefore

x(|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx
(x + x(τn))(|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

II =Z|x+x(τn)|≤R(η)
=Z|x+x(τn)|≤R(η)
−Z|x+x(τn)|≤R(η)
=Z|x+x(τn)|≤R(η)
− x(τn)M (uc, vc) + x(τn)Z|x+x(τn)|>R(η)

(x + x(τn))(|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

x(τn)(|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

≡ IIa + IIb + IIc.

(|uc(x, t)|2 + |vc(x, t)|2)dx

It is clear that, |IIa| ≤ R(η)M (uc, vc). Moreover, by (6.6) and (6.8), we have |IIc| ≤

Rnη. Therefore, collecting the above estimates, we deduce

|zRn(τn)| ≥ |IIb| − |IIa| − |IIc| − |I|

≥ |x(τn)|M (uc, vc) − R(η)M (uc, vc) − 3Rnη.

Next, we claim that there exists c > 0 such that

(6.11)

(6.12)

Assuming the above claim, let us conclude the proof of the lemma. Indeed, the Funda-

mental Theorem of Calculus, (6.9) and (6.11) yield

t ∈ [0, τn].

Thus, using (6.8) we have proved that

(M (uc, vc) − 5η)|x(τn)|

τn ≤ cη + (2M (uc, vc) + 5η)

.

Therefore, choosing η > 0 suﬃciently small such that η < M (uc, vc)/5 and cη/(M (uc, vc)−
5η) < δ/2 and using (6.5), we obtain a contradiction with (6.4).

32

L. G. FARAH AND A. PASTOR

To complete the proof, it remains to establish (6.12). First note that taking the de-
rivative with respect to time in (6.7) and using that (uc, vc) is a solution of (1.1), we
have

Finally, note that for 0 ≤ t ≤ τn and |x| > Rn we have |x + x(t)| ≥ Rn −|x(τn)| = R(η) by
(6.8), and thus, from (6.13) and (6.6) we deduce (6.12). The proof of the lemma is thus
completed.
(cid:3)

Now we are in a position to prove the main result of this section, our rigidity (or

Liouville-type) theorem.
Theorem 6.3 (Rigidity Theorem). Assume that (u0, v0) ∈ H 1 × H 1 has zero momentum
F (u0, v0) = 0 and satisﬁes conditions (1.10) and (1.11). Let (u, v) be the global solution
of system (1.1) with initial data (u0, v0) given by Theorem 1.1 and suppose that

B = {(u(· − x(t), t), v(· − x(t), t)) : t ≥ 0}

is precompact in H 1 × H 1, for some continuous path x ∈ C([0,∞); R3). Then u0, v0 are
both zero.

The main tool in the proof of Theorem 6.3 is the following local version of the Virial

33

identity.
Lemma 6.4. Let (u, v) ∈ C((−T∗, T ∗); H 1 × H 1) be a solution of (1.1) and ϕ ∈ C∞0 (R3).
Deﬁne

V (t) =Z ϕ(x)(|u|2 + |v|2)dx.

Proof. The proof follows the same steps as in [12, Lemma 2.9]. So we omit the details. (cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 6.3. Let ζ ∈ C∞0 (R3) be a radial function such that ζ(x) = |x|2, if
|x| ≤ 1 and ζ(x) = 0, if |x| ≥ 2. For R > 0 deﬁne

Our goal is to study zR(t) for large R > 0 in a suitable time interval. We start with an

upper bound for the derivative of zR(t). Indeed, from (6.14), we get

R(cid:17) (|u(x, t)|2 + |v(x, t)|2)dx.

R(cid:17) · ∇u(t)u(t) + R∇ζ(cid:16) x

R(cid:17) · ∇v(t)v(t)dx(cid:27) .

Therefore, since ∇ζ (x/R) = 0 if |x| ≥ 2R, we can apply the H¨older’s inequality and (1.12)
to obtain

where A = 2c(M (P, Q)A(P, Q))1/2 and thus it is independent of R > 0 and t ≥ 0.

Next, we establish a lower bound for the derivative of zR(t). To this end, we use (6.15)

On the other hand, we have a lower bound for S(u, v)(t) from Lemma (3.3) (iii). In

In this short Appendix we will prove that the relation (1.15) holds.

Proposition 7.1. We have

K +   K.

Proof. The proof that K + ⊂ K is similar to that in the Appendix of [26], where the author
gave the proof in the case of the 3D cubic Schr¨odinger equation, comparing his result with
the one in [6]. Indeed, from the results in [7, Section 3] (see also [22, Remark 2.5]), we
have

A(P, Q) = 3M (P, Q),

and then it does not belong to K +. Thus Proposition 7.1 is proved.
