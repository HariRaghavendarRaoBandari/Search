Abstract— Recently,

counter-
clockwise systems have attracted attention as an interesting
class of systems, which is well-motivated by applications. In
this paper ﬁrst the formulation and extension of negative
imaginary and counter-clockwise systems as (nonlinear) input-
output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation is summarized.
Next it is shown how by considering the time-derivative of
the outputs a port-Hamiltonian system is obtained, and how
this leads to the consideration of alternate passive outputs
for port-Hamiltonian systems. Furthermore, a converse
result to positive feedback interconnection of
input-output
Hamiltonian systems with dissipation is obtained, stating that
the positive feedback interconnection of two linear systems is
an input-output Hamiltonian system with dissipation if and
only if the systems themselves are input-output Hamiltonian
systems with dissipation. This implies that the Poisson and
resistive structure matrices can be redeﬁned in such a way
that the interaction between the two systems only takes place
via the coupling term in the Hamiltonian of the interconnected
system. Subsequently, it is shown how network interconnection
of (possibly nonlinear) input-output Hamiltonian systems with
dissipation results in another input-output Hamiltonian system
with dissipation, and how this leads to a stability analysis of
the interconnected system in terms of the Hamiltonians and
output mappings of the systems associated to the vertices, as
well as the topology of the network.

I. PROPERTIES OF INPUT-OUTPUT HAMILTONIAN

SYSTEMS WITH DISSIPATION

Consider a linear system

˙x = Ax + Bu,

x ∈ Rn, u ∈ Rm

y = Cx + Du,

y ∈ Rm

(1)

with transfer matrix G(s) = C(Is − A)−1B + D. In [14],
[19], [30] G(s) was called negative imaginary1 if D = DT
and the transfer matrix H(s) := s(G(s)−D) is positive real.
In [2], [3], [4] the same notion (also in a nonlinear context)
was coined as counter-clockwise input-output dynamics.

In [14], [30] it was shown that a minimal system (1) has
negative imaginary transfer matrix if and only if D = DT
and there exists an n × n symmetric matrix Q > 0 such that

AT Q + QA ≤ 0, B = −AQ−1C T

(2)

Subsequently in [25] it was shown, by decomposing AQ−1
into its symmetric and skew-symmetric part, that a minimal

from the Nyquist plot interpretation for single-input single-output systems
[14], [3].

system (1) has negative imaginary transfer matrix if and only
if it can be written as

˙x = [J − R](Qx − C T u)

y = Cx + Du, D = DT

(3)

for Q, J, R satisfying

Q = QT , J = −J T , R = RT ≥ 0

with Q > 0.

Any system (3) satisfying (4) (not necessarily Q > 0) was
called in [25] an input-output Hamiltonian system with dissi-

pation (IOHD system), with Hamiltonian function 1
The skew-symmetric matrix J deﬁnes a Poisson structure
matrix, while R is called the resistive structure matrix; see
[15], [23], [9], [22], [17], [26] for the closely related port-
Hamiltonian case (as discussed below).

The deﬁnition of an IOHD system (3) was extended in [25]
to the nonlinear case as follows. For clarity of exposition, we
will throughout only consider the case without feedthrough
terms and with afﬁne dependence on u; see [25], as well as
Remark 2.3 below, for the general nonlinear case.

Deﬁnition 1.1: A system described in local coordinates
x = (x1, · · · , xn) for some n-dimensional state space
manifold X as2

u ∈ Rm

˙x = [J(x) − R(x)](cid:16) ∂H

y = C(x),

y ∈ Rm

(5)
where the n × n matrices J(x), R(x), depending smoothly
on x, satisfy

J(x) = −J T (x), R(x) = RT (x) ≥ 0,

(6)

is called a nonlinear IOHD system, with Hamiltonian H :
X → R and output mapping C : X → Rm.

This deﬁnition is a generalization of the deﬁnition of an
afﬁne input-output Hamiltonian system as originally pro-
posed in [7] and studied in e.g. [20], [21], [8]. In fact, it
reduces to this deﬁnition in case R = 0 (no dissipation) and
J deﬁnes a symplectic form (in particular, has full rank).

The time-evolution of the Hamiltonian of a nonlinear
IOHD system (5) is computed as (exploiting skew-symmetry

2For a function H : Rn → R we denote by ∂H

∂x (x) the n-dimensional
column vector of partial derivatives of H. For a mapping C : Rn → Rm
we denote by ∂CT
∂x (x) the n × m matrix whose j-th column consists of
the partial derivatives of the j-th component function Cj .

This immediately shows passivity with respect to the output z
deﬁned by (8) if additionally the Hamiltonian H is bounded
from below. In fact, the system (5) with output yP H = z
for a general Hamiltonian H is an input-state-output port-
Hamiltonian system [22], [23], [9], [17], of the general form
[26]

˙x = [J(x) − R(x)] ∂H

∂x (x) + [G(x) − P (x)]u, x ∈ X

yP H = [G(x) + P (x)]T ∂H

(10)

with

(cid:20) R(x)
P T (x) S(x)(cid:21) symmetric and ≥ 0,

P (x)

and J(x) and M (x) skew-symmetric. This can be seen by
equating

G(x) = −J(x) ∂C T

∂x (x), P (x) = −R(x) ∂C T

∂x (x),

S(x) = ( ∂C T

∂x (x),

(11)

M (x) = −( ∂C T

∂x (x))T J(x) ∂C T

∂x (x)

This leads to

Proposition 1.2: Given the IOHD system (5). Then its
dynamics together with differentiated output z = ˙y deﬁned
by (8) is an input-state-output port-Hamiltonian system of
the form (10) with yP H = z. Conversely, given a port-
Hamiltonian system (10), then there exists an IOHD system
with the same dynamics and output y = C(x), C : X → Rm,
such that ˙y = yP H if and only if C satisﬁes (11).

Note that

the conditions (11) can be interpreted as
(generalized) integrability conditions on G(x), M (x) and
P (x), S(x). Indeed, for the special case of a basic input-
state-output port-Hamiltonian system

˙x = [J(x) − R(x)] ∂H

∂x (x) + g(x)u

yP H = gT (x) ∂H

∂x (x)

(12)

corresponding to P = 0, S = 0, M = 0 and g = G, the
conditions (11) reduce to

g(x) = G(x) = −J(x) ∂C T

R(x) ∂C T

∂x (x) = 0,

∂x (x),
∂x (x))T J(x) ∂C T

( ∂C T

∂x (x) = 0

(13)

The ﬁrst line implies that the columns gj, j = 1, · · · , m
of the input matrix g(x) are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds
with Hamiltonians −C1, · · · , −Cm. For J corresponding to
a symplectic structure, there exist locally such functions
C1, · · · , Cm if and only if the vector ﬁelds gj leave the
symplectic structure invariant [1], [20], [21].

Example 1.3: Consider the linear mechanical system as
considered in [15], consisting of an alternating mass-spring-
mass-spring system, where the ﬁrst input u1 is the velocity of
the right-hand side of the second spring, and the ﬁrst input
u2 is the force on the left mass. Furthermore, differently
from [15], there are dampers with damping coefﬁcients d1, d2
parallel to the two springs with spring constants k1, k2.
Denoting the masses by m1, m2,
the elongations of the
springs by q12, q20, and the momenta of the masses by p1, p2,
the dynamical equations are given as

where the ﬁrst term is the total potential energy (with K

energy (with M the mass matrix).

For N = 0 (20) can be rewritten into the equivalent

second-order form

(17)

Note that even for the case d2 = 0 the resulting port-
Hamiltonian system is not anymore of the basic form (12),
due to the presence of the feedthrough matrix M , as already
noticed (from a different point of view) in [15].

Obviously, we can consider alternate passive outputs for
the port-Hamiltonian system (10). (An output ˆyP H is called
a passive output for (10) if
dt H ≤ uT ˆyP H.)The sim-
plest choice is to deﬁne the new passive output ˆyP H :=
∂x (x), with g(x) = G(x) − P (x), resulting in a new
gT (x) ∂H
input-state-output port-Hamiltonian system of the basic form
(12). In general, given the port-Hamiltonian system (10) all
outputs

deﬁne alternate passive outputs, corresponding to alternate
port-Hamiltonian systems. Notice, however, that these alter-
nate outputs cannot always be integrated to outputs of an
IOHD system. Such new passive outputs were recently used
in [6] for IDA-PBC control, continuing on e.g. [12], see also
[27].

(19)

Still a larger class of passive outputs can be obtained by
allowing for different J, R and H in (10), in such a way that
the dynamics of (10) remains the same.

A. Mechanical systems with collocated sensors and actua-
tors

IOHD systems show up naturally in many applications;
see e.g. [14], [19], [4], [18], [7], [20], [21]. A clear example
are mechanical systems with co-located position sensors and
force actuators, which in the linear case are represented as
the IOHD systems (with q denoting the position vector and
p the momentum vector)

y = Lq,

(20)
where D ≥ 0 is the damping matrix; deﬁning the resistive
structure matrix R = diag(0, D). Usually N = 0 (no
’gyroscopic forces’), in which case the Hamiltonian (total
energy) is given as

II. POSITIVE FEEDBACK INTERCONNECTION OF IOHD

SYSTEMS

Just like the negative feedback interconnection of pas-
sive (or port-Hamiltonian) systems results in a passive (re-
spectively, port-Hamiltonian) system, the positive feedback
interconnection of IOHD systems results in another IOHD
system; see [2], [3] for the counter-clockwise case. Indeed,
the positive feedback interconnection

u1 = y2 + e1,

u2 = y1 + e2,

(23)

with e1, e2 two external inputs, of two linear IOHD systems

i ui(cid:1)
˙xi = [Ji − Ri](cid:0)Qixi − C T

yi = Cixi,

i = 1, 2,

(24)

with equal number of inputs and outputs can be seen [25] to
result in the IOHD system

Hence the stability of the interconnected system can be
characterized in terms of the interconnected Hamiltonian (26)
as follows.

Proposition 2.1: [25] Consider two IOHD systems. The
interconnected IOHD system (25) is stable having no eigen-
value at zero if the interconnected Hamiltonian (26) has a
strict minimum at the origin (x1, x2) = (0, 0). Conversely, if
(25) is asymptotically stable, then the interconnected Hamil-
tonian (26) has a strict minimum at the origin (x1, x2) =
(0, 0).

In ([14], Theorem 5) it has been shown that Q, with Q1 >

0, Q2 > 0 is positive deﬁnite, if and only

λmax(cid:0)C1Q−1

2(cid:1) < 1,

1 C T

1 · C2Q−1

2 C T

(27)

where λmax(K) denotes the maximal eigenvalue of a sym-
metric matrix K. An easy proof follows by the fact that Q >
0 if and only if Q1 > 0 and Q2 −C T
1 C2 > 0. This

which is equivalent to (27).

This allows for the following interpretation. The dc-gain of
an IOHD system (3) with D = 0 is given by the expression

− CA−1B = CQ−1C T

(28)

Hence the interconnected IOHD system (25) resulting from
the positive feedback interconnection of two stable IOHD
systems (Q1 > 0, Q2 > 0) is stable having no eigenvalue
at zero if and only if the dc loop gain is less than unity.
This can be regarded as a rephrasement of the fundamental
result concerning the stability of the positive feedback inter-
connection of two systems with negative imaginary transfer
matrices, as obtained in [3] for the SISO case with D = 0
and in [14] for the general MIMO case.

In the case of positive feedback interconnection of two
IOHD systems in second-order form (22) this amounts to
the following corollary.

Corollary 2.2: Consider two systems (22) with Mi >
0, Ki > 0, i = 1, 2. Then the positive feedback intercon-
nection results in the second-order system

(compare with [3], Theorem 6). Like in the linear case,
the stability properties of the interconnected system are
determined by Hint.

Remark 2.3: A general nonlinear IOHD system is deﬁned

in [25] as a system of the form

˙x = (J(x) − R(x)) ∂H

∂x (x, u),

u ∈ Rm,

y = − ∂H

∂u (x, u),

y ∈ Rm,

(33)

for some function H(x, u), with R(x), J(x) satisfying (6).
Furthermore, it is shown in [25] how also the positive feed-
back interconnection of two general IOHD systems results in
another general IOHD system, provided some transversality
conditions are met. A particular case of (33) is a static system

The positive feedback interconnection of a second-order
’plant’ system (22) with a second-order ’controller’ system
is known in the literature, see e.g. [11], [10], as positive
position feedback. It has the advantage of being insensitive to
spillover, and has favorable other robustness properties, see
e.g. [10] for a discussion. Note that by (30) the stability of the
closed-loop system only depends on the potential energies
of the ’plant’ and ’controller’ system and on the matrices
L1, L2. In particular the stability does depend not on the
damping matrices D1, D2.

Similar to the linear case it can be seen [25] that the
positive feedback interconnection of two nonlinear IOHD
systems3 (5), indexed by i = 1, 2, results in the nonlinear

(u),

u, y ∈ Rm,

(34)

(29)

for some function P : Rm → R. The positive feedback
interconnection of an IOHD system (5) with such a static
IOHD system (34) results in the IOHD system (5), with
modiﬁed Hamiltonian given as

Hcl(x) := H(x) + P (C(x))

(35)

Conversely, it can be shown [16] that any static output
feedback applied to (5) will result in an IOHD system with
respect to the same J(x), R(x) if and only it corresponds to
positive feedback interconnection with a static IOHD system
(34) for some P .

We note that the Poisson and resistive structure of the
interconnected system (31) is the direct sum of the respective
structures of the two component systems. This is opposite to
the case of the negative feedback interconnection of two port-
Hamiltonian systems [22], [26], where the Poisson structure
matrix of the interconnected contains an additional coupling
term, and where, on the other hand, the Hamiltonian of the
interconnected system is just the sum of the Hamiltonians of
the two component systems; see also [25].

III. A CONVERSE RESULT

In this section we will show that not only the positive
feedback interconnection of two IOHD systems results in
another IOHD system, but that, at least in the linear case, also
the converse holds: if the positive feedback interconnection
of two arbitrary linear systems is an IOHD system (with

inputs e1, e2 and outputs y1, y2), then the two systems are
necessarily IOHD as well.

This result can be seen as an analog to the converse result
obtained for the negative feedback interconnection of passive
systems in [13].

Proposition 3.1: Consider

two linear systems Σ1 =
(A1, B1, C1), Σ2 = (A2, B2, C2) with equal input and output
dimensions. Suppose the positive feedback interconnection
(23) of Σ1 and Σ2 results in a minimal system, with inputs
e1, e2 and outputs y1, y2, that is IOHD. Then also Σ1, Σ2
are IOHD systems.

Proof: Without

loss of generality assume that C1
and C2 have full row rank. Since the positive feedback
interconnection of Σ1 and Σ2 is a minimal IOHD system,
there exists an invertible matrix P = Q−1, cf. (2), such that

By decomposing AiPi, i = 1, 2, into their skew-symmetric
and symmetric parts as AiPi = Ji − Ri, i = 1, 2, it follows
that the positive feedback interconnection of Σ1 and Σ2 is
alternatively given as the IOHD system with respect to the
Poisson structure and resistive structure matrix

which is in general different from the originally assumed
Poisson structure and resistive structure matrix (containing in
general coupling terms between the two component systems).
Hence Proposition 3.1 stipulates that for an interconnected
system which is IOHD the Poisson structure and resistive
structure matrices can be always redeﬁned as being block-
diagonal, in which case, as a result, the coupling between the
component systems Σ1 and Σ arises only from the coupling
term in the interconnected Hamiltonian (26).

Note ﬁnally that an essential part in the above proof is the
fact that we consider a ’full’ positive feedback interconnec-
tion (23). In particular, a positive feedback interconnection of
the form u1 = y2 + e1,
u2 = y1 (no e2 input) of two linear
IOHD systems will result in an IOHD system with inputs e1
and y1, but the converse need not hold in this case.

IV. NETWORKS OF IOHD SYSTEMS

In this section it will be shown how the fact that the
positive feedback interconnection of two IOHD systems is
another IOHD system can be naturally extended to networks
of IOHD systems.

Consider an undirected graph with N vertices and M
edges, together with an N × N weighted adjacency matrix
A (symmetric since the graph is undirected). Furthermore,
take the multi-agent point of view by associating to each of
the vertices i ∈ {1, · · · , N } a nonlinear IOHD system (5),
indexed by i, with equal number of inputs and outputs m

(independent of i). These IOHD systems are interconnected
by setting

the port-Hamiltonian case in [24]), since the interconnection
(52) again corresponds to positive feedback.

u = (A ⊗ Im) y + e,

(50)

where u is
the stacked N m vector, with subvectors
u1, · · · , uN , and analogously for y and the external inputs e.
(Here A ⊗ Im denotes the Kronecker product of A and Im,
i.e., the N m × N m matrix obtained by multiplying every
element of A by the m × m identity matrix Im.) Note that
for the special case N = 2, M = 1, A12 = A12 = 1, this
reduces to the positive feedback interconnection (23).

As in Section II it can be readily seen that the resulting
multi-agent system is again an IOHD system with inputs
e1, · · · , eN and outputs y1, · · · , yN , and total interconnected
Hamiltonian given as

Hint(x1, · · · , xN ) := H1(x1) + · · · + HN (xN )−

(51)

i,j=1 Aij (Ci(xi))T Cj(xj ),

1

2PN

where xi, Hi, Ci, i = 1, · · · , N, are respectively the state
vectors, Hamiltonians and output mappings of the IOHD
systems associated to the vertices. Stability of the resulting
IOHD system is again determined by this interconnected
Hamiltonian.

Another scenario, more similar to the one considered in
[29], [30], is to consider a directed graph, with N vertices
and M edges and N × M incidence matrix D, and to
associate not only to each of the vertices i ∈ {1, · · · , N } a
nonlinear IOHD system (5) with equal number of inputs and
outputs m, but also to each of the edges k ∈ {1, · · · , M }.
These IOHD systems are now naturally interconnected by
setting

(cid:20)uv
ue(cid:21) =(cid:20)

0

D ⊗ Im

DT ⊗ Im

0

(cid:21)(cid:20)yv
ye(cid:21) +(cid:20)ev
ee(cid:21)

(52)

Here uv and yv are the stacked N m vectors of inputs and
outputs of the IOHD systems associated to the vertices, and
ue and ye are the stacked M m vectors of inputs and outputs
of the IOHD systems associated to the edges, and ev, ee are
the external inputs associated to the vertices, respectively
edges. The resulting system is again an IOHD system, with
total Hamiltonian being given by

Here the superscripts v throughout refer to the vertex IOHD
systems, and the superscripts e to the edge IOHD systems. In
particular, xv
i , i = 1, · · · , N, are the state vectors,
Hamiltonians and output mappings of the vertex IOHD
systems, and xe
k, k = 1, · · · , M, are the state vec-
tors, Hamiltonians and output mappings of the edge IOHD
systems.

Note that this last setting is different from the network

and edges of a directed graph as considered in [5] (or in

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

The class of input-output Hamiltonian systems with dis-
sipation has been further explored as an interesting class
of nonlinear systems, which is well-motivated by applica-
tions, and closely related to port-Hamiltonian systems and
passivity(-based) control. A striking result is the converse
result obtained (for linear systems) in Section III, which
has the interesting implication that the Poisson and resistive
structure matrices of an interconnected system that is IOHD
can be always redeﬁned in such a way that the coupling
between the subsystems is only via the coupling term in the
interconnected Hamiltonian. This is a case that happens quite
frequently in modeling of multi-physics systems.

Of course, an extension of this converse result to the
nonlinear case is a topic for further research, as well as the
exploration of applications of the network interconnection
theory of IOHD systems initiated in Section IV.
