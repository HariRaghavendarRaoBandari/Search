OPTIMAL DENSITIES OF PACKINGS CONSISTING OF

HIGHLY UNEQUAL OBJECTS

DAVID DE LAAT

Abstract. Let ∆ be the optimal packing density of Rn by unit balls. We show
the optimal packing density using two sizes of balls approaches ∆+(1−∆)∆ as
the ratio of the radii tends to inﬁnity. More generally, if B is a body and D is a
ﬁnite set of bodies, then the optimal density ∆{rB}∪D of packings consisting of
congruent copies of the bodies from {rB}∪D converges to ∆D +(1−∆D)∆{B}
as r tends to zero.

1. Introduction

There has been extensive research into the determination of optimal monodis-
perse packing densities. A well-known example is Hales’s proof of the Kepler conjec-
ture on the optimal sphere packing density in R3 [3]. More recently, packings with
polydispersity have been investigated: New lower and upper bounds for the density
of packings of spheres using several sizes have been given in respectively [4] and [5].
In applications, sphere packings can be used to model many-particle systems, and
here it is important to also consider polydispersity as this can “dramatically aﬀect
the microstructure and the eﬀective properties of the materials” [7]. In this note
we discuss the case of wide dispersity; that is, the case where the size ratio of the
larger to the smaller objects grows large. One would expect boundary behavior to
become negligible as the ratio of the radii tends to inﬁnity, which intuitively means
the density converges to ∆ + (1 − ∆)∆; see for example [6]. To the best of our
knowledge a proof of this has not yet been published. Here we provide such a proof
which uses standard techniques albeit it is not trivial.

We prove the following theorem:

Theorem 4.2. Suppose B is a body and D is a ﬁnite set of bodies. Then,

lim
r↓0

∆{rB}∪D = ∆D + (1 − ∆D)∆{B}.

Here, given a set of bodies D, we denote by ∆D the optimal packing density using
the bodies from D. If we take B to be the unit disk in R2 and D = {B}, then
the theorem says the optimal packing density using two sizes of disks converges to
0.9913 . . . as the ratio of the radii goes to inﬁnity. By using that the optimal sphere
packing density in R3 is known to be π/(3√2) = 0.7404 . . ., the theorem says the
optimal packing density using two sizes of balls converges to 0.9326 . . . as the ratio
of the radii goes to inﬁnity.

2. Packings and density

We deﬁne a body to be a bounded subset of Rn that has nonempty interior and
whose boundary has Lebesgue measure zero. Such a set is Jordan measurable, which
means its Lebesgue measure can be approximated arbitrarily well by the volume
of inner and outer approximations by ﬁnite unions of n-dimensional rectangles [1].
Moreover, since the interior of a body is nonempty it contains a ball with strictly
positive radius and hence has strictly positive Lebesgue measure.

A packing using a set of bodies D is a set of congruent copies of the elements
in D such that the interiors of the copies are pairwise disjoint. In other words, a
packing is of the form

P = nRiBi + ti : i ∈ N, Ri ∈ O(n), ti ∈ Rn, Bi ∈ Do,

i + ti) ∩ (Rj B◦

j + tj) = ∅ for all i 6= j. Here B◦

where (RiB◦
i denotes the interior
of Bi, and O(n) is the orthogonal group. Deﬁne ΣD to be the set of packings that
use bodies from D and ΛD the set of packings P ∈ ΣD that have rational box
periodicity; that is, for which there exists a p ∈ Q such that |P| + pei = |P| for all
i ∈ [n]. Here |P| = S P denotes the carrier of P and ei is the ith unit vector.
The density and upper density (provided these exist) of a set S ⊆ Rn are deﬁned
as

ρ(S) = lim
r→∞

λ(S ∩ rC)

rn

and ρ(S) = lim sup

r→∞

λ(S ∩ rC)

.

rn

Here λ is the Lebesgue measure on Rn, and C is the axis-aligned unit cube centered
about the origin. The upper density ¯ρ(|P|) is deﬁned for every P ∈ ΣD, because
for each r > 0, the set |P| ∩ rC is Lebesgue measurable with measure at most rn.
The density ρ(|P|) is deﬁned for every P ∈ ΛD: Let p ∈ Q be a period of P , then
c = λ(|P| ∩ kpC)/(kp)n does not depend on k ∈ N, and for r inbetween kp and
(k + 1)p we have

λ(|P| ∩ kpC)
((k + 1)p)n ≤

λ(|P| ∩ rC)

rn

λ(|P| ∩ kpC)
((k + 1)p)n +

((k + 1)p)n − (kp)n

((k + 1)p)n

,

≤

where both the rightmost term and | λ(|P |∩kpC)

((k+1)p)n − c| converge to 0 as k → ∞.

We deﬁne the optimal packing density for packings that use bodies from D by

∆D = sup
P ∈ΣD

ρ(|P|) = sup

P ∈ΛD

ρ(|P|).

The second equality follows because for each P ∈ ΣD, we can construct a packing
from ΛD whose density is arbitrarily close to ρ(|P|) by taking the subpacking con-
tained in a suﬃciently large cube and tiling space with this part of the packing.
One might wonder whether the optimal density depends on C being a cube, but it
follows from [2] that the optimal density ∆D is also equal to
λ(|P| ∩ (rB + t))/λ(rB),

lim
r→∞

sup
P ∈ΛD

where t is any point in Rn and where B is any compact set that is the closure of
its interior and contains the origin in its interior.

3. Approximating the interstitial space of a packing

We ﬁrst show that a packing, and hence the interstitial space of a packing, can
be approximated uniformly by grid cubes. Given S ⊆ Rn and k ∈ Z, deﬁne the
packings

Gk(S) = nCk,t : t ∈ Zn, Ck,t ⊆ So and Gk(S) = nCk,t : t ∈ Zn, Ck,t ∩ S 6= ∅o,

as k → ∞ for P ∈ ΛD uniformly.
Proof. Let ε > 0 and P ∈ ΛD. Since P has rational box periodicity, the pack-
ings Gk(|P|) and Gk(|P|) have rational box periodicity, which means the densities
ρ(|Gk(|P|)|) and ρ(|Gk(|P|)|) are deﬁned. For each k ∈ Z we have

hence

We have

|Gk(|P|)| ⊆ |P| ⊆ |Gk(|P|)|,

ρ(|Gk(|P|)|) ≤ ρ(|P|) ≤ ρ(|Gk(|P|)|).

Every B ∈ D is Jordan measurable, so there exists a number K = K(B, ε) such
that

λ(|Gk(B)|) ≥ λ(B) − ε and λ(|Gk(B)|) ≤ λ(B) + ε

for all k ≥ K. Since D is a ﬁnite set, this implies

there exists a number r0 = r0(D) ≥ 0 such that

Moreover, each body in the ﬁnite set D has nonempty interior, so there exists a
constant c = c(D) such that the number of congruent copies of elements from D
that ﬁt in a cube of radius r + r0 is at most crn. Hence,

4. Polydisperse packings
Let D and D′ be sets of bodies. Given P ∈ ΛD, deﬁne

ΛD′(P ) = nQ ∈ ΛD∪D′ : Q = P ∪ R, R ∈ ΛD′o.

The optimal density of such packings is given by ∆D′ (P ) = supQ∈ΛD′ (P ) ρ(|Q|). In
the following lemmas we give the optimal density given that a part of the packing
is already ﬁxed.

Lemma 4.1. Suppose D is a ﬁnite set of bodies. For every ε > 0 there is a scalar
R = R(D, ε) > 0 such that

ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} − ε ≤ ∆{B}(P ) ≤ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} + ε

for all P ∈ ΛD and all bodies B with diam(B) ≤ R.
Proof. Let 0 < ε ≤ 1 and P ∈ ΛD.

By Lemma 3.1 there exists an integer K1 = K1(D, ε) such that
ρ(|Gk(P c)|) ≥ 1 − ρ(|P|) − ε/2 for all k ≥ K1.

By the deﬁnition of density there exists a scalar R1 = R1(k, ε) > 0 such that for
each body B with diam(B) ≤ R1 we can pack each cube in Gk(P c) with congruent
copies of B with density at least ∆{B}− ε/2. By taking the union of the packings of
the cubes together with {P} we obtain a packing from ∆{B}(P ) which has density
at least

ρ(|P|) + ρ(|Gk(P c)|)(∆{B} − ε/2) ≥ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|) − ε/2)(∆{B} − ε/2)

≥ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} − ε.

This implies

∆{B}(P ) ≥ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} − ε

for all P ∈ ΛD and all bodies B with diam(B) ≤ R1.

By Lemma 3.1 there exists an integer K2 = K2(D, ε) such that
ρ(|Gk(P c)|) ≤ 1 − ρ(|P|) + ε/3 for all k ≥ K2.

Again, by the deﬁnition of density there exists a scalar R2 = R2(k, ε) such that for
each body B with diam(B) ≤ r and each Q ∈ Λ{B}(P ), the intersection of |Q \ P|
with a cube from Gk(P c) has density at most ∆{B} + ε/3 in that cube. So,

ρ(|Q|) = ρ(|P|) + ρ(|Q \ P|) ≤ ρ(|P|) + ρ(|Gk(P c)|)(∆{B} + ε/3)

≤ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|) + ε/3)(∆{B} + ε/3)
≤ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} + ε,

hence

∆{rB}(P ) ≤ ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B} + ε

for all P ∈ ΛD and all bodies B with diam(B) ≤ R2.

The proof is then complete by setting R = min{R1, R2}.

Using the above result the following lemma is immediate.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose B is a body and D is a ﬁnite set of bodies. Then,

lim
r↓0

∆{Bk}(P ) = ρ(|P|) + (1 − ρ(|P|))∆{B}

for P ∈ ΛD uniformly.

We prove the main result by using the uniform convergence in the above lemma.

Theorem 4.3. Suppose B is a body and D is a ﬁnite set of bodies. Then,

lim
r↓0

∆{rB}∪D = ∆D + (1 − ∆D)∆{B}.

Proof. We have Λ{rB}∪D = SQ∈ΛD Λ{rB}(Q), so
sup

∆{rB}∪D =

ρ(|P|) = sup

Q∈ΛD

P ∈Λ{rB}∪D

P ∈Λ{rB}(Q)

ρ(|P|) = sup

Q∈ΛD

∆{rB}(Q),

and

By Lemma 4.2, we have

lim
r↓0

∆{rB}∪D = lim
r↓0

sup
Q∈ΛD

∆{rB}(Q).

lim
r↓0

∆{rB}(Q) = ρ(|Q|) + (1 − ρ(|Q|))∆{B},

and since convergence is uniform for Q ∈ ΛD, we can interchange limit and supre-
mum and obtain

lim
r↓0

sup
Q∈ΛD

∆{rB}(Q) = sup
Q∈ΛD

lim
r↓0

∆{rB}(Q) = sup
Q∈ΛD

(ρ(|Q|) + (1 − ρ(|Q|))∆{B})

Q∈ΛD

= ∆{B} + (1 − ∆{B}) sup

ρ(|Q|) = ∆{B} + (1 − ∆{B})∆D,
and since ∆{B} +(1−∆{B})∆D = ∆D +(1−∆D)∆{B} this completes the proof. (cid:3)
As a special case of the above theorem we obtain the result mentioned in the
abstract of this note: We have limr↓0 ∆{B,rB} = ∆ + (1 − ∆)∆, where B is the
closed unit ball and where ∆ = ∆{B}. By iteratively applying the above theorem
and rewriting the resulting expression we see that if B1, . . . , Bk are bodies, then
∆{r2B2,...,rkBk}

rk↓0··· lim

r1↓0

∆{r1B1,...,rkBk} = ∆{B1} + (1 − ∆{B1}) lim

rk↓0··· lim

r2↓0

so we get the intuitive result ∆D = 1. The following proposition gives a strengthen-
ing of this result. Note that the condition inf B∈D ∆{B} > 0 here is always satisﬁed
if we restrict to convex bodies.

Proposition 4.4. Suppose D is a set containing bodies of arbitrarily small diameter
such that s = inf B∈D ∆{B} > 0. Then there exist packings consisting of congruent
copies of bodies from D whose density is arbitrarily close to 1; that is, ∆D = 1.
Proof. Let 0 < ε < s. Select an arbitrary B1 ∈ D and choose P1 ∈ Λ{B1} such that
ρ(|P1|) ≥ ∆{B1} − ε. By Lemma 4.1 there exists a body B2 ∈ D and a packing
P2 ∈ Λ{B2}(P1) such that

ρ(|P2|) ≥ ρ(|P1|) + (1 − ρ(|P1|))∆{B2} − ε
= ∆{B2} + (1 − ∆{B2})ρ(|P1|) − ε
≥ ∆{B1} + ∆{B2} − ∆{B1}∆{B2} − 2ε
≥ 1 − (1 − ∆{B1} + ε)(1 − ∆{B2} + ε) ≥ 1 − (1 − (s − ε))2.

Moreover, if B is a body and D = {rB : r > 0}, then for every k there is an r ∈ Rk
such that

∆D ≥ 1 − (1 − ∆{B})k −

By continuing like this we see that for each k there exists a packing Pk ∈ ΛD such
that

which completes the proof.

ρ(|Pk|) ≥ 1 − (1 − (s − ε))k,
