Abstract

We study the kinetic decoupling of light (. 10 GeV) magnetic dipole dark matter
(DM). We ﬁnd that present bounds from collider, direct DM searches, and structure
formation allow magnetic dipole DM to remain in thermal equilibrium with the early
universe plasma until as late as the electron-positron annihilation epoch. This late kinetic
decoupling leads to a minimal mass for the earliest dark protohalos of thousands of solar
masses, in contrast to the conventional weak scale DM scenario where they are of order
10−6 solar masses.

Introduction

A characteristic feature of dark matter (DM) is the way the DM couples to Standard Model
(SM) particles. Although weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are typically assumed
to couple through a massive force carrier, long-range force carriers such as the photon remain
an interesting possibility. Examples of interactions mediated by the photon are DM with the
dipole or higher multipole interactions and milli-charged DM [1–3]. Such interactions through
a massless or light mediator can be of special interest when the momentum transfer is small,
because they exhibit an infrared enhancement in the cross section. They are commonly dis-
cussed for light DM (mass . 10 GeV), to which the current DM direct search experiments are
not so sensitive [4–25]. In this paper, we are interested in how long such light DM with a light
mediator can stay in kinetic equilibrium with the surrounding hot plasma in the early Uni-
verse, and how this may aﬀect the size of the smallest DM protohalos (the ﬁrst gravitationally
bound objects). We are referring to kinetic decoupling, often quoted as thermal decoupling,
characterized by the moment at which the rate of DM elastic scattering becomes negligible
compared to the Hubble expansion rate. Kinetic decoupling typically occurs much after the
chemical decoupling that characterizes the epoch at which the DM annihilation rate becomes
comparable to the expansion rate, because the DM annihilation rate is much smaller than the
rate at which the DM scatters elastically with the abundant SM particles in the plasma. When
the DM has a small mass and interacts through a long-range force carrier, the DM tends to stay
in kinetic equilibrium longer than the conventional weak scale WIMPs [26–38]. We therefore
pay particular attention to low kinetic decoupling temperatures and examine the bounds from
collider and DM direct search experiments. We present our analysis for the concrete example
of a light DM that possesses an anomalous magnetic dipole moment. A sizable magnetic dipole

1

moment arises naturally, for instance, in neutral composite particles such as the neutron. There
have been attempts to model composite DM having such dipole moments in a UV-complete
theory [39,40]. In this paper we do not seek a UV-complete theory, but treat the DM mass and
its magnetic dipole moment as free parameters, and we study generic constraints in a model
independent manner.

In §2 we give our general formalism to estimate the DM kinetic decoupling temperature.
We then apply our formalism to the magnetic dipole DM as a concrete example in §3. After a
brief review of the protohalo size estimation in §4, we explore the experimental bounds on the
kinetic decoupling temperature and correspondingly the protohalo size from collider and direct
search experiments in §5. A discussion and conclusions are given in §6.

2 Dark matter kinetic decoupling

DM kinetic decoupling occurs when γ(T ), the rate of momentum transfer between the DM and
the thermal plasma of temperature T through the elastic scattering, becomes small compared
with the Hubble expansion rate H(T ). We estimate the kinetic decoupling temperature Tkd as
the solution of γ(Tkd)/2 = H(Tkd) [27]. To obtain this solution Tkd, one can solve the Boltzmann
equation without assuming the DM to be a perfect ﬂuid, which can be reduced to the following
Fokker-Planck equation, valid for DM mass mχ ≫ T and small momentum transfer,

We apply our formalism to magnetic dipole dark matter in the following section.

3 Magnetic dipole dark matter

We consider a spin-1/2 DM particle χ coupled to photons through a magnetic moment inter-
action given by the gauge-invariant dimension-ﬁve Lagrangian

L = −

µχ χ σµνχF µν.

(10)

Here µχ is the DM magnetic dipole moment, Fµν is the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and σµν =
i
2(γµγν −γνγµ). The tensor current ¯χσµνχ vanishes for a Majorana particle, thus the particle we
consider is a Dirac fermion. We assume CP invariance and do not hence consider electric dipole
operators. In our quantitative discussions, we give the magnetic dipole moment in units of the
nuclear magneton µN = e/2mp (= 0.105 e fm). From a purely dimensional point of view, one
may expect the dark matter magnetic dipole moment to be at most of order µχ/µN ∼ mp/mχ.
Much larger magnetic dipole moments µχ may hint to a complex nature of the DM particles.
The momentum relaxation rate γ(T ) depends on the elastic χ + i → χ + i cross section,
where i is a charged particle in the plasma. The unpolarized matrix element squared for the
interaction of a magnetic-dipole DM particle with a particle of mass mi and charge qie through
a photon exchange is

is a screening factor with Fscreen(0) = 1. We then estimate the relaxation rate γ(T ) from Eq.

particle, we can simplify the estimation of the momentum transfer γ(T ) as [10]

(15)

where ρi is the density of the plasma species and σT is the transport cross section given in Eq.
(5).

We numerically solve the condition γ(Tkd)/2 = H(Tkd) to estimate the kinetic decoupling
temperature Tkd. In this paper, we focus on DM masses mχ . 10 GeV and correspondingly
small kinetic decoupling temperatures. We hence only consider Tkd < 100 MeV. At 500 keV .
Tkd . 100 MeV, the dominant charged plasma particles are the light charged leptons (qi =
±1). After the electron-positron annihilation epoch (Tkd . 500 keV), the electron abundance
decreases signiﬁcantly. For such low temperatures, we consider DM scattering oﬀ electrons and
protons since scattering oﬀ protons can dominate the DM momentum transfer when the proton
and electron abundances are comparable. In our numerical analysis, the chemical potentials
for the electrons and the protons are taken care of by demanding charge neutrality ne = np.

Our results are shown as contour plots of Tkd as a function of mχ and µχ in Fig. 1 (red solid
lines). A large gap in the Tkd contours is observed in correspondence to the electron-positron
annihilation epoch. Long after the electron-positron annihilation epoch (T . 50 keV), the
small number density of SM particles the DM can scatter oﬀ imposes that the DM coupling
has to be large for the DM to remain in kinetic equilibrium with the SM particles. Such a DM
coupling large enough to realize Tkd . me/10 is however severely constrained by collider and
DM search experiments, as we discuss in §5.

magnetic dipole DM. The black dotted curves show Mf s (the mass inside the free streaming

in units of nuclear magnetons µN (∼ 0.1 e fm).

4 Protohalo mass

As an application of our dipole DM kinetic decoupling study, we estimate the smallest protohalo
size for a given dipole moment µχ and mass mχ.

The smallest protohalo mass can be estimated from the horizon size at kinetic decoupling
and the free streaming scale of DM once decoupled from the thermal bath [26,27]. The horizon
size is relevant here to quantify the protohalo mass because acoustic oscillations due to the
coupling between DM and SM ﬂuid damp the DM ﬂuctuations inside the horizon. The mass
inside the horizon at kinetic decoupling is

Mkd ≈

4π
3

ρm(Tkd)
H 3(Tkd)

,

(16)

where ρm is the matter density. DM free streaming is also relevant for the estimation of the
protohalo mass because free streaming causes the erasure of ﬂuctuations on scales smaller than
the free-streaming length

λf s = a(t0)Z t0

tkd

v(t)
a(t)

dt.

(17)

Here a(t) is the universe scale factor and v(t) is the DM particle velocity. The free streaming
length λf s is the distance a DM particle can travel without interacting with the plasma from the
time of kinetic decoupling tkd to the present time t0. DM ﬂuctuation modes with wave number
greater than kf s = 2π/λf s are suppressed, and the protohalo cutoﬀ mass from free streaming
eﬀects can be estimated as the DM mass contained inside a sphere of radius π/kf s = λf s/2,

Mf s ≈

4π

kf s(cid:19)3
3 (cid:18) π

ρm(t0).

(18)

The smallest protohalo mass can be estimated by the greatest of Mkd and Mf s, taking account
of these two independent eﬀects (acoustic oscillation damping and free streaming). The smallest
possible protohalo mass can hence be obtained once the kinetic decoupling temperature and
the DM mass are speciﬁed.

Our results for the minimum protohalo mass are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of mχ and µχ.
We obtain masses as large as 103 M⊙, which, as found in the next section, are not excluded by
current collider and DM direct search constraints. We note that for the conventional WIMPs
such as those in supersymmetric models, the typical DM protohalo size is around the earth mass
10−6M⊙, and the eﬀective operator analysis also typically bounds the protohalo mass to be less
than the earth mass from collider and DM search experiments [32–36]. Such a 10−6M⊙ mass
is far below the mass scale the current numerical simulation studying the large scale structures
can resolve. Our light magnetic dipole DM scenarios allow for much larger protohalo masses.

5 Collider and direct search experiment constraints

Constraints from collider and DM direct search experiments can be complementary to each
other for light DM particles, in that such a particle can be kinematically accessible at colliders
while direct search experiments lose sensitivity to light DM due to small recoil energies.

7

5.1 Collider constraints

Collider constraints on the DM magnetic dipole moment from LEP give tighter constraints
than the Tevatron and the LHC [43, 44]. We show these constraints in Fig 2. The light DM
masses of interest to us are within the kinematic reach of the colliders, and the lepton collider
has an advantage over the hadron collider because of its smaller background. We refer the
reader to [43] for more details on the comparison of the LEP, Tevatron and LHC bounds shown
in Fig. 2.

We add to Fig. 2 the future reach of the ILC regarding the kinetic decoupling of magnetic
dipole DM [45–48]. We show constraints from the ILC mono-photon signals e+e− → ν ¯νγ
assuming a center of mass energy √s = 1 TeV and an integrated luminosity 500 fb−1. For the
background estimation, we simply consider the main irreducible background e+e− → ν ¯νγ. In
our analysis, the polarizations of electron and positron beams are assumed to be (P−, P+) =
(0.8, 0.5), which helps in reducing the backgrounds from the t and u channel W bosons exchange
due to its V -A couplings. We also applied the selection cuts Eγ > 8 GeV and | cos θγ| < 0.995,
accounting for the detector loss of acceptance of events that are too close to the beam line or too
soft. This also helps in further reducing the co-linear and infrared-enhanced backgrounds. A cut
Eγ ≤ 450 GeV was also applied to further suppress the s-channel on-shell Z recoil contributions.
For a suﬃciently large number of events, the event probabilities become Gaussian and we put
upper bounds on the dipole moment by requiring that the total number of background and
signal events along with the statistical ﬂuctuations ﬁt in the 90% conﬁdence interval of the
background events. For the light DM mass range of our interest (mχ . O(10) GeV), the
increase of the collider energy does not improve the bounds signiﬁcantly, and the improvement
of the bounds mainly can come from the increase in the luminosity. We combine these collider
constraints with those from the DM direct search experiments in the following subsection.

5.2 Direct dark matter search constraints

For the constraints from the DM direct search experiments, the diﬀerential cross section for
scattering of the magnetic dipole DM with a target nucleus is (this is the non-relativistic limit
of Eq. (7)) [8, 49, 50]

Here mT is a target nucleus mass, mN is the nucleon mass, and mχT is the DM-target nu-
cleus reduced mass. Furthermore, µT is the nucleus magnetic moment and µN is the nuclear
magneton. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (19) represents the coupling of the DM magnetic dipole to
the nuclear electric ﬁeld and the second term corresponds to the coupling of the DM magnetic
dipole and the nuclear magnetic ﬁeld.

The constraints on the DM magnetic dipole moment from direct DM search experiments
have been studied in [50]. In Fig. 2 we show the 90% conﬁdence level upper bounds on µχ
from CDMSLite, SuperCDMS and LUX [51–55] (see [50] for details). We extend the analysis
in [50] to the lower DM mass region in Fig. 2 by applying the Maximum Gap Method [56] to
the CDMSLite data [51]. For this, we use the Helm form factor for FE with the normalization
FE(0) = 1 [57–59] while we ignore the momentum dependence in FM for simplicity. The

by taking account of the quenching factor Q(ER) = E ′/ER and assuming the detector resolu-
tion to be Gaussian. Our analysis uses the energy range from 0.17 to 7.00 keVee, and takes
the eﬃciency ǫ(E ′) = 0.985 and the energy resolution σ = 14 eVee. We use the quenching
factor [51, 52]

with g(ǫ) = 3ǫ0.15 + 0.7ǫ0.6 + ǫ, ǫ = 11.5ERZ −7/3 and k = 0.133Z 2/3A−1/2.

The bounds from the direct DM search experiments become µχ/µN . 10−5, 2 × 10−4, 10−3
for mχ = 10, 5, 3 GeV, respectively. The current direct search experiments are not sensitive to
magnetic dipole DM with mχ . 2 GeV, as apparent in Fig. 2. We can see that, for magnetic
dipole DM with mχ & 5 GeV to be consistent with the current direct search experiments, kinetic
decoupling should have occurred before the beginning of the electron-positron annihilation
epoch (T ∼ me). We can also ﬁnd that the current collider and direct search experiments
require that magnetic dipole DM with mχ & 2 GeV should decouple kinetically before the
electron-positron annihilation ceases to be eﬃcient (Tkd & me/10 ∼ 50 keV). For mχ & 3
MeV, a null search at the ILC would force Tkd & me/10. For an even lighter mass, DM with
suﬃciently large magnetic dipole moment µχ can stay in kinetic equilibrium even after the
electron-positron annihilation epoch (Tkd . me/10), even though, due to the small number
density of baryons and electrons the DM can elastically scatter oﬀ, Tkd far below me/10 would
require a large DM coupling strength which is severely constrained by colliders.

6 Discussion/conclusion

There is a further bound (a cosmological bound) on magnetic dipole DM that is however much
weaker than those presented above.
It arises from the fact that DM elastic scattering with
baryons can cause the suppression of the DM ﬂuctuation growth in the early Universe. This
suppression comes from the dragging of DM ﬂuctuations by the baryon ﬂuid, and it constrains
the transport cross section σT [1, 4, 5, 10, 31]. Ref. [10], for instance, obtained the constraint
σT /mχ . 3.3×10−3cm2/g from the Planck CMB and SDSS Lyman-α forest data [61,62], which
leads to the requirement

µN(cid:19)2

. 7.5 · 104 1 +

1 + 2(mχ/mp)2

(1 + (mχ/mp))2!−1

(cid:18) mχ
mp(cid:19) .

(24)

This cosmological bound was obtained for a DM mass larger than the proton mass [10], and
hence, for a DM mass to which the current direct DM search experiments are sensitive, the
cosmological bound from DM ﬂuctuation suppressions due to momentum transfer in DM elastic
scattering is currently much weaker than the other bounds we have discussed in this paper.
The quantitative analysis of the constraints from the large scale structure in the Universe in
the limit of mχ < mp is beyond the scope of our paper and we leave it for our future work to
be compared with our collider bounds.

We found the current direct DM search and collider experiments allow light magnetic dipole
DM to remain in kinetic equilibrium as late as the electron-positron annihilation epoch. The al-
lowed protohalo mass turns out to be O(103)M⊙ for mχ ∼ 1 GeV, and larger protohalo masses
are enforced for lighter DM. This is in contrast to the typically quoted protohalo masses of
order the earth mass O(10−6)M⊙ for the conventional weak scale DM [34, 35]. The clariﬁca-
tion of subhalo size clumpiness would be of great interest for the interpretation of DM search
experiments which rely on the assumption of a smooth DM density [63–66].

Even though we have here focused on studies only down to the electron-positron annihila-
tion epoch, further analysis of an even lower kinetic decoupling temperature would be worth
exploring. We plan to come back to such issues regarding a very low DM kinetic decoupling
temperature beyond the range covered in this paper in more general scenarios, including other
experimental bounds such as indirect DM search experiments.
