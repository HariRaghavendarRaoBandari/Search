A Suﬃcient Condition for Nilpotency of

the Commutator Subgroup

Raimundo Bastos and Pavel Shumyatsky

Abstract. Let G be a ﬁnite group with the property that if a, b
are commutators of coprime orders, then |ab| = |a||b|. We show
that G′ is nilpotent.

The following criterion of nilpotency of a ﬁnite group was estab-

lished by B. Baumslag and J. Wiegold [1].

Theorem 1. Let G be a ﬁnite group in which |ab| = |a||b| whenever

the elements a, b have coprime orders. Then G is nilpotent.

Here the symbol |x| stands for the order of the element x in a group
G. In the present article we establish a similar criterion of nilpotency
for the commutator subgroup G′. Recall that an element g ∈ G is a
commutator if g = x−1y−1xy for suitable x, y ∈ G. By deﬁnition, the
commutator subgroup G′ is the subgroup of G generated by all com-
mutators. The purpose of the present article is to prove the following
theorem.

Theorem 2. Let G be a ﬁnite group in which |ab| = |a||b| when-
ever the elements a, b are commutators of coprime orders. Then G′ is
nilpotent.

In view of the above theorem one might suspect that a similar phe-
nomenon holds for other group-words. Recall that a group-word w =
w(x1, . . . , xs) is a nontrivial element of the free group F = F (x1, . . . , xs)
on free generators x1, . . . , xs. A word is a commutator word if it be-
longs to the commutator subgroup F ′. Given a group-word w, it can be
viewed as function deﬁned in any group G. The subgroup of G gener-
ated by the w-values is called the verbal subgroup of G corresponding

to the word w.
following question.

It is usually denoted by w(G). One might ask the

Let w be a commutator word and G a ﬁnite group with the property
that if a, b are w-values of coprime order, then |ab| = |a||b|. Is then the
verbal subgroup w(G) nilpotent?

Asking a similar question for noncommutator words would not be
interesting since an easy counter-example is provided just by any non-
abelian simple group G, say of exponent e, and the word xn, where
n is a divisor of e such that e/n is prime. Even in the case of com-
mutator words the answer to our question is negative: Kassabov and
Nikolov showed in [3] that for any n ≥ 7 the alternating group An
admits a commutator word all of whose nontrivial values have order
3. We suspect that the answer to the question is positive in the case
of multilinear commutator words, that is, words having a form of a
multilinear Lie monomial (like for example [[x1, [x2, x3]], [x4, x5]]).

Throughout the remaining part of this short note G denotes a ﬁnite
group satisfying the hypothesis of Theorem 2. We denote by X the set
of commutators in G. As usual, π(K) stands for the set of primes
dividing the order of a group K. The Fitting subgroup of K is denoted
by F (K).

Lemma 3. Let x ∈ X and N be a subgroup normalized by x. If

(|x|, |N|) = 1, then [x, N] = 1.

Proof. Choose y ∈ N. The order of the commutator [x, y] is
prime to that of x. Therefore we must have |x[x, y]| = |x||[x, y]|. How-
ever x[x, y] = y−1xy. This is a conjugate of x and so |x[x, y]| = |x|.
Therefore [x, y] = 1.

Lemma 4. If G is soluble, then G′ is nilpotent.

Proof. Arguing by induction on |G| we can assume that the sec-
ond commutator subgroup G′′ is nilpotent. Suppose that there are two
diﬀerent primes p ∈ π(G′) and q ∈ π(G′′). Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup
of G′ and Q a Sylow q-subgroup of G′′. It is straightforward from the
Focal Subgroup Theorem [2, Theorem 7.3.4] that P is generated by
P ∩ X. Lemma 3 tells us that if x ∈ P ∩ X, we have [Q, x] = 1.
Therefore [Q, P ] = 1. It follows that P is normal in P G′′ and therefore
P ≤ F (P G′′). Since P G′′ is normal in G′, we conclude that P ≤ F (G).
This holds for every prime p such that G′′ is not a p-group. Therefore
if G′′ is divisible by at least two diﬀerent primes, all Sylow subgroups
of G′ belong to F (G) and so G′ is nilpotent.
If G′′ is q-group, it is
obvious that the Sylow q-subgroup of G′ is normal in G and so again

we conclude that all Sylow subgroups of G′ belong to F (G). The proof
is complete.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 2. Now suppose that G is a counter-example
of minimal order. So all proper subgroups in G are soluble and we can
assume that G = G′. Let R be the soluble radical in G.
It follows
that G/R is nonabelian simple. By Lemma 4 R′ is nilpotent. Suppose
that G is nonsimple and R 6= 1 and, for a prime q, let Q be the Sylow
subgroup of F (G). Let T be the subgroup of G generated by all com-
mutators that are q ′-elements. In view of the Focal Subgroup Theorem,
all Sylow p-subgroups of G′ for p 6= q are contained in T . Therefore the
commutator subgroup of G/T is a q-group. Since G = G′, we conclude
that G = T . Combining Lemma 3 with the Focal Subgroup Theorem
we now deduce that F (G) ≤ Z(G).

Further, we remark that for any x ∈ G the subgroup hx, Ri is soluble
and so hx, Ri′ is nilpotent.
It follows that [R, x] ≤ F (G) = Z(G)
and therefore R = Z2(G). In particular, R is nilpotent and therefore
R = Z(G). Thus, our group G is quasisimple.

Since G does not possess a normal 2-complement, it follows from the
Frobenius Theorem [2, Theorem 7.4.5] that G contains a 2-subgroup H
and an element of odd order b ∈ NG(H) such that [H, b] 6= 1. In view
of Thompson’s Theorem [2, Theorem 5.3.11] we can assume that H
is of nilpotency class at most two and H/Z(H) is elementary abelian.
We claim that G contains an element a such that

a is a 2-element;
a ∈ X;
a has order 2 modulo Z(G).

Indeed, since H is of class at most two, all elements in [H, g] are
commutators for any g ∈ H. If for some g ∈ H the subgroup [H, g] is
not contained in Z(G), any element of [H, g] that has order 2 modulo
Z(G) has the required properties. Therefore we assume that [H, g] is
contained in Z(G) for any g ∈ H. In particular H ′ ≤ Z(G). It follows
that [H, b] ∩ CG(b) ≤ Z(G) and all elements in [H, b] are commutators
modulo Z(G). If d ∈ [H, b] such that d 6∈ Z(G) and d2 ∈ Z(G), then
the commutator [d, b] is as required. This proves the existence of an
element a with the above properties.

Now we ﬁx such an element a. Since G/Z(G) is nonabelian simple,
it follows from the Baer-Suzuki Theorem [2, Theorem 3.8.2] that there
exists an element t ∈ G such that the order of [a, t] is odd. On the one

hand, it is clear that a inverts [a, t]. On the other hand, by Lemma 3,
a must commute with [a, t]. This is a contradiction.
