Comment on “Catalytic coherence”

˚Aberg has claimed in a recent Letter [1] that the co-
herence of a reservoir can be used repeatedly to perform
coherent operations without ever diminishing in power to
do so. The claim has particular relevance for quantum
thermodynamics because, as shown in [1], latent energy
that is locked by coherence may be extractable without
incurring any additional cost. We show here, however,
that repeated use of the reservoir gives an overall coher-
ent operation of diminished accuracy and is necessarily
accompanied by an increased thermodynamic cost.

We focus on an example where an energy reservoir E,

l=0 eilθ|l0 + li/√L
initially in the state |ηL,l0(θ)i = PL−1
where θ represents a phase angle and |ni are eigenstates
of energy with eigenvalue ns, is used to convert a system
S with deﬁnite energy into a superposition of diﬀerent
energies [2]. Taking the claim on its face value would sug-
gest that, provided L is suﬃciently large, the reservoir E
can be used repeatedly to transform systems in the state

|ψ0i to |ψ(θ)i = (|ψ0i + eiθ|ψ1i)/√2, where |ψni are en-
ergy eigenstates with energy ns, and thus it can convert
a collection of k systems in |ψ0i⊗k to |Ψ(θ)i = |ψ(θ)i⊗k.
Note that |hΨ(θ)|Ψ(φ)i| = |hψ(θ)|ψ(φ)i|k can be less than
|hηL,l0(θ)|ηL,l0 (φ)i| for suﬃciently large values of k. This
would imply that the collection of systems can be used
to discriminate between diﬀerent values of the reservoir
phase with an accuracy that is better than that of the
initial reservoir state [3, 4]. As the linearity of quantum
mechanics forbids this result, some qualiﬁcation of the
claim is clearly needed.

What the claim and the states |ψ(θ)i⊗k [3] leave un-
accounted are any reservoir-induced correlations between
the systems. When due account is taken of such collec-
tive eﬀects, unavoidable limitations to what can be done
using the reservoir become evident.

For example, the reservoir state |ηL,l0(θ)i is asymmet-
ric with respect to the symmetry group G = {Tφ} where
Tφ = exp(iN φ), N is the number operator, and φ is a
phase angle. A natural measure of the degree of asym-
metry is given by the quantity AG(·) [5], which here is
AG(σ) = ln L for σ = |ηL,l0(θ)ihηL,l0(θ)|. The initial
state of the collection of systems ρ = (|ψ0ihψ0|)⊗k is
symmetric with respect to G, i.e. AG(ρ) = 0, and the
asymmetry of the systems-plus-reservoir combination is
just that of the reservoir,
i.e. AG(ρ ⊗ σ) = AG(σ),
i.e.
where G operates globally on composite systems,
T (SE)
φ . The asymmetry measure is

non-increasing under both G-invariant operations O, i.e.
AG[O(ρ ⊗ σ)] ≤ AG(ρ ⊗ σ), and the partial trace, i.e.
AG(ρ′) ≤ AG[O(ρ ⊗ σ)] where ρ′ = TrEO(ρ ⊗ σ) is the
reduced state of the collection of systems [5]. As the
operation V (U ) deﬁned in Ref.
[1] is G-invariant, the
eﬀect of its repeated application between the reservoir
and individual systems is bounded by the result that
AG(ρ′) ≤ ln L. Thus, the collection of systems cannot
be given greater asymmetry than the initial asymmetry
of the reservoir. (For comparison, the asymmetry of the
state |ψ(θ)i⊗k diverges as k increases [3].)
To see the impact of this limitation, consider the col-
lective ﬁdelity Fk = hψ(0)|⊗kρ′|ψ(0)i⊗k between the de-
sired state |ψ(0)i⊗k and the reduced state ρ′ of k sys-
tems generated from |ψ0i⊗k using the reservoir in state
σ = |ηL,l0(0)ihηL,l0 (0)| and k applications of the operator
V (U ) where hψn|U|ψn′i = 1/√2 for n, n′ = 0, 1. We ﬁnd
Fk = TrE[(1 + ∆−1)kσ(1 + ∆−1)k/4k] = 1 − k/L, where
∆ is deﬁned in Ref.
[1], which reduces linearly with k,
the number of times the reservoir is used. This repre-
sents a serious limitation to the power of the reservoir
to perform multiple coherent operations, and hence the
extent to which it is truly catalytic in nature.

Moreover, the entropy of the reservoir increases each
time it is used to perform a coherent operation. In order
to return the reservoir to its initial state the accumulated
entropy needs to be erased. According to Landauer’s era-
sure principle [6–8], its erasure will incur a ﬁnite physical
cost. If the coherent operations are used in a work ex-
traction process, then any such erasure cost needs to be
accounted against the net output.

In summary, the pertinent issues when considering re-
peated use of the reservoir is the overall accuracy of mul-
tiple coherent operations and any costs associated with
returning the reservoir to its initial state; we have shown
the accuracy diminishes linearly with the number of oper-
ations and each operation incurs a thermodynamic cost.
Any application of the results of Ref. [1] would be incom-
plete without paying due attention to these issues.
