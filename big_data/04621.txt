Abstract. In [E. Tsukerman and L. Williams, Bruhat Interval Polytopes, Advances in Math-
ematics, 285 (2015), 766-810] it is shown that every Bruhat interval of the symmetric group
satisﬁes the so-called generalized lifting property. In this paper we show that a Coxeter group
satisﬁes this property if and only if it is ﬁnite and simply-laced.

1. Introduction

The Kostant-Toda lattice is an integrable Hamiltonian system which has been recently
studied in detail by Kodama and Williams in [9]; in this paper particular attention is devoted
to the asymptotic behaviour of the ﬂow corresponding to an initial point associated with (a
given point in) a cell R+
u,v of the totally non negative ﬂag variety, where [u, v] is a Bruhat
interval in the symmetric group Sn. When considering a natural multivariable generalisation
of this problem, called the full Kostant-Toda hierarchy, they also proved that the moment
polytope associated to the ﬂow with initial point corresponding to R+
u,v is what they called
a Bruhat interval polytope as it can be described as the convex hull in Rn of permutation
vectors (w(1), . . . , w(n)) as w varies in the given Bruhat interval.

In [10] Tsukerman and Williams studied some combinatorial aspects of a Bruhat interval
polytope and in particular they found a dimension formula and proved that every face of a
Bruhat interval polytope is itself a Bruhat interval polytope. The key result that they used in
this study is what they called the generalized lifting property which generalizes the (standard)
lifting property for symmetric groups and was surprisingly remained unnoticed so far. This
generalized lifting property asserts that for every u < v in the symmetric group and any
“minimal” reﬂection (i.e. a transposition) t such that u < ut and v > vt, we have u ⊳ ut 6 v
and u 6 vt ⊳ v, where the symbol ⊳ denotes the covering relation in Bruhat order. The main
fact about this property is that such minimal reﬂection always exists. The (standard) lifting
property of a Bruhat interval is a classical feature of the theory of a Coxeter group (W, S): it
says that if [u, v] is a closed Bruhat interval in W and s ∈ S are such that v > vs and u < us
then u ⊳ us 6 v and u 6 vs ⊳ v, although it does not ensure that such simple reﬂection s
exists. This property is well-known and is a basic tool in the combinatorics and geometry of
Coxeter groups (see, e.g., [8, Chapter 5], [2, Chapter 2], [6]) and has also found important
applications in the combinatorics of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (see, e.g., [3, 5]).

The main target of this paper is to understand which Coxeter groups satisfy such general-
ized lifting property; our ﬁnal result is that a Coxeter group satisﬁes this property if and only
if it is ﬁnite and simply-laced. The proof uses in an essential way a geometric representation
of a (ﬁnite) Coxeter group as a group generated by reﬂections in a (Euclidean) vector space.
Several steps in the proof are done in complete generality, but there are some other peculiar

results whose proofs still make use of the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite Coxeter groups, and in par-
ticular we have to consider Weyl groups of type D and E separately. We think it would be
very interesting to ﬁnd a classiﬁcation-free proof of our result.

The paper is organized as follows. In §2 we establish the notation, we introduce all the
preliminary results in the theory of reﬂection and Coxeter groups that are needed, and we
show some general results which link the generalized lifting property to the presentation of
a Coxeter group as a reﬂection group. In §3 and in §4 we develope in a similar and parallel
way our theory for Weyl groups of type D and E respectively. In §5 we consider aﬃne Weyl
groups and we prove some further basic facts that will allow us to complete the proof of our
main result in §6.

2. Notation and preliminaries

We begin by establishing some notation. N is the set of non-negative integers and, if n ∈ N,

[n] := {1, 2, ..., n}; in particular [0] = ∅. We denote by |X| the cardinality of a set X.

Next we recall some basic results in the theory of Coxeter groups and reﬂection groups
which will be useful in the sequel. The reader can consult the fundamental books [2, 4, 8] as
comprehensive sources for this theory and in particular for the undeﬁned notation, results
stated without proof, and for further details.

Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system. If v, w ∈ W we deﬁne ℓ(v, w) := ℓ(w) − ℓ(v), where ℓ(z)

is the length of the element z ∈ W with respect to S. We let

DL(w) := {s ∈ S|ℓ(sw) < ℓ(w)},
DR(w) := {s ∈ S|ℓ(ws) < ℓ(w)}.

The parabolic subgroup WJ ⊆ W is the subgroup with J ⊆ S as generator set. In particular

WS = W and W∅ = {e}.

We consider on W the Bruhat order 6 (see, e.g., [2, Chapter 2] or [8, Chapter 5]). With

[u, v] is denoted an interval in W , i.e., if v, w ∈ W ,

[v, w] := {z ∈ W |v 6 z 6 w}.

The relation v ⊳ w means that u < v and ℓ(u, v) = 1.

We recall the following fundamental property of the Bruhat order, known as the lifting

property (see [2, Proposition 2.2.7]):

Proposition 2.1. Let v, w ∈ W be such that v < w and s ∈ DR(w) \ DR(v). Then v 6 ws
and vs 6 w.

A Coxeter system (W, S) is called simply-laced if m(s, r) 6 3 for every s, r ∈ S, m being

its Coxeter matrix.

The set T = {wsw−1|s ∈ S, w ∈ W } is the set of reﬂections of a Coxeter system (W, S).

For a Coxeter group W we let, for any u, v ∈ W ,

D(u)
A(u)
AD(u, v)

:= {t ∈ T |ut < u},
:= {t ∈ T |u < ut},
:= A(u) ∩ D(v).

A ﬁnite reﬂection group is a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(V ), where V is a ﬁnite dimensional real
vector space, which is generated by reﬂections, i.e. elements of order 2 that ﬁx a hyperplane

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

pointwise. Let W be a ﬁnite reﬂection group and T be the set of all reﬂections in W . For
each reﬂection t ∈ T we denote by Ht the hyperplane ﬁxed by t and call this the reﬂecting
hyperplane associated to the reﬂection t. Moreover, for every reﬂection t ∈ T one can choose
a non-zero vector αt ∈ V such that

• t(αt) = −αt for all t ∈ T ;
• the set Φ = {±αt : t ∈ T } is invariant under the action of W .

The set Φ is called the set of roots and we assume without lack of generality that Φ spans V .
The connected components of the complement of the union of all reﬂecting hyperplanes are
called chambers and we recall that the action of W on the set of chambers is simply transitive.
If we ﬁx a chamber C0 (that will be called fundamental chamber) we let H +
t be the halfspace
determined by Ht which contains C0 and we let

Then there exists a unique set of roots ∆ ⊂ Φ+, called base, such that

Φ+ = Φ+(C0) = [t∈T

{±αt} ∩ H +
t .

• ∆ is a linear basis of V ;
• every root in Φ+ can be expressed as a linear combination with non-negative coeﬃ-

cients of the elements in ∆.

Changing αt with −αt if necessary we can assume that Φ+ = {αt, t ∈ T }. If we let S ⊂ T
be the indexing set of ∆, i.e.

∆ = {αs : s ∈ S}

we have that (W, S) is a ﬁnite Coxeter system whose set of reﬂections is exactly T , and
every ﬁnite Coxeter system arises in this way as a ﬁnite reﬂection group. In the sequel we
will always assume that a ﬁnite Coxeter group comes equipped with the structure of a ﬁnite
reﬂection group as above.

The set of reﬂections T is partially ordered by letting, for all r, t ∈ T , r ≺ t if αt − αr is

still a linear combination of the roots αs, s ∈ S, with non-negative coeﬃcients.

The length function of an element w ∈ W and the set D(w) have the following geometric
interpretation which will be fundamental in our study. The length of an element w ∈ W
equals the number of reﬂecting hyperplanes which separate the fundamental chamber C0
from the chamber Cw := w−1(C0). A direct consequence is that the set D(w) equals the set
of reﬂections t ∈ T such that the associated reﬂecting hyperplane separates Cw from C0, and
in particular we have

(1)

ℓ(w) = |D(w)|.

Remark 2.2. An immediate consequence of (1) is that, if ℓ(u) < ℓ(v) and in particular if
u < v, then |AD(u, v)| > ℓ(u, v) > 0, since |AD(u, v)| = ℓ(u, v) + |D(u) \ D(v)|. In particular,
if |AD(u, v)| = 1 we have ℓ(u, v) = 1.

We will be interested also in the action of reﬂections on halfspaces determined by the
reﬂecting hyperplanes. It is clear that for any reﬂection t we have t(Hr) = Hrt where rt := trt
and therefore we have that either t(H +

r ) = H +

rt or t(H +

r ) = H −
rt.

The following result is crucial in our work.

Proposition 2.3. Let r, t ∈ T . The following are equivalent

4

r ) = H −
rt;

(1) t(H +
(2) r ∈ D(t);
(3) for some u ∈ W we have r ∈ D(u) if and only if rt ∈ A(ut).
(4) for every v ∈ W we have r ∈ D(v) if and only if rt ∈ A(vt).
r we have Crt = t(Cr) ⊂ H +

Proof. (1) implies (2). Since Cr ⊂ H −
rt. Therefore rt ∈ A(rt) i.e.
t > rt. Since the map w 7→ w−1 is an automorphism of W as a poset, we also have t > tr i.e.
r ∈ D(t).

(2) implies (3). Letting u = t we clearly have r ∈ D(u) and rt ∈ A(e).
(3) implies (1). We have either Cu ∈ H −
rt or Cu ∈ H +

r and Cut ∈ H +

r and Cut ∈ H −

rt. As

Cut = t(Cu) it follows that t(H −

r ) = H +
rt.

(1) implies (4). Let v ∈ W . We have r ∈ D(v) if and only if Cv ∈ H −

r and rt ∈ A(vt) if

and only if Cvt = t(Cv) ∈ H +

r ) = H +
(4) implies (2) Take v = t and the result follows.

rt and since t(H −

rt the two conditions are equivalent.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.4. Let r, t ∈ T , r 6= t, be such that rt = tr. Then r ∈ A(t).

Proof. By contradiction, if r ∈ D(t), we have t(H +
r , by Proposition 2.3. This implies
Ht ⊆ Hr and so Hr = Ht; moreover r(αt) is still an eigenvector for t of eigenvalue −1, since
r and t commute. Therefore r(αt) = cαt and since r is reﬂection we necessarily have c = −1
and hence r = t.
(cid:3)

r ) = H −

If t ∈ T , we have the following partition of the set T :

and an involution T → T deﬁned as the conjugation by t, i.e.

T = {t} ⊔ (D(t) \ {t}) ⊔ A(t),

rt := trt,

for all r ∈ T .

Lemma 2.5. The sets {t}, D(t) \ {t} and A(t) are invariant under conjugation by t, for all
t ∈ T .

Proof. Clearly {t} is invariant. Let r ∈ D(t) \ {t}, i.e. e < rt < t or, equivalently e < tr =
(rt)−1 < t, since the inversion is an automorphism of the poset (W, 6); then e < rtt = tr < t.
It follows that A(t) is invariant too.
(cid:3)

The following theorem generalizes, in the symmetric group, the lifting property stated in
Proposition 2.1; this result will be extended to the case of ﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter groups
and this is the main motivation of the paper.

Theorem 2.6. [10, Theorem 3.3] Let [u, v], u < v, be a Bruhat interval in the symmetric
group An and t be a minimal element in AD(u, v) with respect to ≺. Then u ⊳ ut 6 v and
u 6 vt ⊳ v.

We end this section recalling some known facts about the R-polynomials; see [2, Chapter
5], [8, Chapter 7] and the references there for more information. We just recall here that for
any Coxeter group W there exists a unique family of polynomials {Ru,v}u,v∈W ⊆ Z[q] such
that, for all u, v ∈ W :

(1) Ru,v = 0 if u (cid:10) v;

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

5

(2) Rv,v = 1;
(3) if u < v and s ∈ DR(v) then

(2)

Ru,v =(Rus,vs,

qRus,vs + (q − 1)Ru,vs,

if s ∈ DR(u),
otherwise.

These polynomials are called R-polynomials. In the hypothesis of Theorem 2.6, the simple
reﬂection in the recursion (2) can be replaced by any minimal reﬂection in AD(u, v).

Proposition 2.7. [10, Proposition 5.3] Let [u, v], u < v, be a Bruhat interval in the symmet-
ric group An and t be a minimal element in AD(u, v). Then

Ru,v = qRut,vt + (q − 1)Ru,vt.

As shown in [10, Section 5], if t ∈ AD(u, v) is any reﬂection such that u ⊳ ut 6 v and

u 6 vt ⊳ v, the result of the proposition could be not true.

3. Type D

As explained in the introduction, some properties needed in the proof of our main result
are proved using the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite Coxeter groups. In this section we examine in
detail the case of Weyl groups of type Dn and show all the preliminary results that will be
needed to prove that the generalized lifting property holds for every interval of Dn.

For any integer n > 1 the group Dn can be identiﬁed with the set of signed permutations
with an even number of negative entries (see [2, Chapter 8] for more details). If w ∈ Dn
we write w = [w(1), . . . , w(n)] and call this the window notation of w. A set of Coxeter
generators is S = {si,i+1|1 6 i 6 n − 1} ∪ {t1,2} and the set of reﬂections of the Coxeter
system (Dn, S) is

T = {si,j|1 6 i < j 6 n} ∪ {ti,j|1 6 i < j 6 n},

where, as elements of Dn in the window notation,

(3)
(4)

si,j = [1, 2, ..., i − 1, j, i + 1, ..., j − 1, i, j + 1, ..., n],
ti,j = [1, 2, ..., i − 1, −j, i + 1, ..., j − 1, −i, j + 1, ..., n],

for all 1 6 i < j 6 n. For notational convenience, if i > j we also let si,j := sj,i and ti,j := tj,i.
For a proof of the next proposition see [2, Proposition 8.2.1].

Proposition 3.1. Let w ∈ Dn and i < j; then si,j ∈ D(w) if and only if w(i) > w(j) and
ti,j ∈ D(w) if and only if w(i) + w(j) < 0. In particular

ℓ(w) = |{(i, j) ∈ [n] × [n] : i < j, w(i) > w(j)}| + |{(i, j) ∈ [n] × [n] : i < j, w(i) + w(j) < 0}|.

For example, ℓ(si,j) = 2(j − i) − 1 and ℓ(ti,j) = 2(j + i − 3) + 1.
In a classical realization of Dn as a ﬁnite reﬂection group in GL(Rn), if we denote by αi,j the
positive root corresponding to the reﬂection si,j and by βi,j the positive root corresponding
to the reﬂection ti,j, we have αi,j = ei − ej and βi,j = −ei − ej for all 1 6 i < j 6 n, where

6

{e1, ..., en} is the canonical basis of Rn. We have

αi,j =

αk,k+1,

j−1

βi,j = β1,2 +

αk,k+1 +

αk,k+1,

Xk=1

Xk=2

for all 1 6 i < j 6 n. By (5) and (6) we obtain the following description of the poset (T, (cid:22)).

Proposition 3.2. For the Coxeter system (Dn, S) the relations in the poset (T, (cid:22)) are the
following:

(1) si,j (cid:22) sh,k if and only if h 6 i and j 6 k;
(2) si,j ≺ th,k if and only if (i, h) 6= (1, 1) and j 6 k;
(3) ti,j (cid:22) th,k if and only if i 6 h and j 6 k;
(4) ti,j 6≺ sh,k,

for all 1 6 i < j 6 n, 1 6 h < k 6 n.

For any set I = {i, j} and x ∈ I, deﬁne xI = i if x = j and xI = j otherwise. The proof of

the following result is a simple veriﬁcation and is therefore omitted.

Proposition 3.3. Let r ∈ T and i, j ∈ [n], i 6= j, I = {i, j}. Then

if r = sh,x, x ∈ I, h /∈ I
if r = th,x, x ∈ I, h /∈ I
otherwise.

if r = sh,x, x ∈ I, h /∈ I
if r = th,x, x ∈ I, h /∈ I
otherwise.

If t ∈ T , the set D(t) can be completely described.

Proposition 3.4. Let 1 6 i < j 6 n and I := {i, j}; then

D(t) \ {t} =({sh,x|x ∈ I, i < h < j},

{sh,x, th,xI |x ∈ I, h 6∈ I, h < x},

if t = si,j,
if t = ti,j.

Proof. We prove the result for ti,j, the case si,j being similar and simpler. By Corollary 2.4,
Lemma 2.5 and Proposition 3.3 it is enough to show that for x ∈ {i, j} and h /∈ {i, j} we have
sh,x ∈ D(ti,j) if and only if h < x. But this follows immediately from Proposition 3.1.
(cid:3)

An immediate consequence of the description of the poset (T, (cid:22)) in Proposition 3.2 and

Proposition 3.4 is the following observation.

Corollary 3.5. Let t ∈ T ; then r ≺ t for all r ∈ D(t) \ {t}.

The following is a key result used in the proof of the generalized lifting property in §6.

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

Theorem 3.6. Let u, v ∈ Dn be such that AD(u, v) 6= ∅, t be a minimal element in AD(u, v)
and r ∈ D(t) \ {t}; then

r ∈ A(u) ⇔ r ∈ A(v) ⇔ rt ∈ D(v) ⇔ rt ∈ D(u).

Proof. First note that r ∈ A(u) ⇔ r ∈ A(v) and rt ∈ D(u) ⇔ rt ∈ D(v), by the minimality
of t, Lemma 2.5 and Corollary 3.5. To prove the other implications there are two cases to
consider.

(1) t = si,j: in this case we have r = sh,x for some x ∈ {i, j} and i < h < j by Proposition
3.4, and rt = sh,xI by Corollary 3.3.
If r ∈ A(v), i.e. vj < vx < vh if x = i and
vh < vx < vi if x = j, then sh,xI ∈ D(v). If sh,xI ∈ D(v) then vh > vj > vi if x = i
and vj > vi > vh if x = j, therefore sh,x ∈ A(v).

(2) t = ti,j:

in this case ui + uj > 0, vi + vj < 0 and we can assume r = sh,x, where
x ∈ {i, j}, h 6∈ {i, j} and h < x by Propositions 3.4 and Corollary 3.3, since the
statement for a reﬂection r ∈ D(t) is equivalent to the same statement for rt. By
Corollary 3.3 we also have rt = th,xI . Assume r ∈ A(v); therefore vh < vx. So
vh + vxI < vx + vxI < 0, which implies th,xI ∈ D(v). Finally, if th,xI ∈ D(u) we have
uh + uxI < 0; since ui + uj = ux + uxI > 0 we ﬁnd uh < ux, i.e. sh,x ∈ A(u).

(cid:3)

This last proposition of this section will be crucial for the inductive step in the proof of

Theorem 6.3.

Proposition 3.7. Let u, v ∈ Dn and t be a minimal element in AD(u, v). If t /∈ S then there
exists s ∈ S such that

(1) s ∈ D(t);
(2) st is minimal in AD(us, vs),
(3) st = ts.

Moreover s ∈ DR(v) if and only if s ∈ DR(u).

Proof. Let 1 6 i < j 6 n. If t = si,j choose s = sj−1,j; then s ∈ D(t) and tst = si,j−1 = sts.
Since (us)i = ui, (us)j−1 = uj we have si,j−1 ∈ A(us) and similarly we can show that
si,j−1 ∈ D(vs). Assume there exists r ∈ AD(u, v) such that r ≺ si,j−1. By the description
of the partial order ≺ we have that r = sh,k with i 6 h < k 6 j − 1. If k < j − 1 then
r ∈ AD(u, v) contradicting the minimality of t.
If k = j − 1 then rs = sh,j ∈ AD(u, v)
contradicting again the minimality of t.

Now let t = ti,j. If i > 1 then s = si−1,i ∈ D(t) and tst = ti−1,j = sts. If i = 1 then j > 2
and we can let s = sj−1,j. Then s ∈ D(t) and tst = ti,j−1 = sts. The fact that st is a minimal
element in AD(us, vs) can be proved as in the former case and is left to the reader. The last
statement follows directly by Theorem 3.6.
(cid:3)

4. The group E8

This section is devoted to the study of the Weyl group (of type) E8 and in particular we
are going to obtain parallel results to those obtained in §3 for Weyl groups of type Dn. As
many results are rather technical we will only sketch some of the proofs. We collect here a
description of a possible realization of the Weyl group E8 as a ﬁnite reﬂection group that

8

FABRIZIO CASELLI AND PAOLO SENTINELLI

is mainly developed in [7]. First we ﬁx some notation. For any H ⊂ [8] and any vector
x = (x1, . . . , x8) ∈ R8 we let

and Σ(x) := Σ[8](x). Next we introduce a set of reﬂections on R8.

ΣH (x) := Xh∈H

xh

• For all I ⊂ [8], |I| = 2, I = {i, j}, we let sI ∈ GL(R8) be given by

xk
xi
xj

if k 6= i, j
if k = j
if k = i,

sI(x)k =


for all x = (x1, . . . , x8) ∈ R8. The endomorphism sI is a reﬂection as it ﬁxes pointwise
the hyperplane of equation xi − xj = 0 and sends the vector αI := ej − ei (where we
assume i < j and we denote by e1, . . . , e8 the canonical basis elements of R8) to its
negative;

• for all H ⊂ [8] such that |H| = 3, 6 we let sH ∈ GL(R8) be given by

sH(x)i :=(xi,

xi + |H|

9 Σ(x) − ΣH(x),

if i /∈ H
if i ∈ H.

The endomorphism sH is a reﬂection as it ﬁxes pointwise the hyperplane of equation
|H|

9 Σ(x) − ΣH(x) = 0 and sends the vector αH =Ph∈H eh to its negative.

• for all L ⊂ [8] with |L| = 1, L = {l}, we let sL ∈ GL(R8) be given by

sL(x)i =(xi − xl,
tion xl = 0 and sends the vector αL = el +P8

−xl,

if i 6= l,
if i = l.

If we let

T = {sH : H ⊂ [8] and |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6}.

The endomorphism sL is also a reﬂection as it ﬁxes pointwise the hyperplane of equa-

i=1 ei to its negative.

one can check that the set

Φ := {±αH : H ⊂ [8] and |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6}

is invariant under the action of all reﬂections in T and therefore the group W generated by T
is a ﬁnite reﬂection group. If H = {h1, . . . , hr} with r = |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6 we also write sh1,...,hr
and αh1,...,hr instead of s{h1,...,hr} and α{h1,...,hr} respectively.

If we take the following as the fundamental chamber

1
3
we have that the corresponding base of Φ is given by

C0 := {x ∈ R8 : x1 < x2 < · · · < x8,

Σ(x) − Σ{1,2,3}(x) < 0}.

and so the corresponding set of simple reﬂections is

∆ := {α1,2, . . . , α7,8, α1,2,3}

S := {s1,2, . . . , s7,8, s1,2,3}

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

and it is now a straightforward check that (W, S) is a Coxeter system of type E8 and we
simply denote it by E8. The set of positive roots is given by all αH, |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6 and we
have the following decompositions of the positive roots:

j−1

(1) αi,j =

αi,i+1, for all i < j;

Pk=i

(2) αJ = α1,2,3 + α1,j1 + α2,j2 + α3,j3, for all J = {j1, j2, j3} such that 1 6 j1 < j2 < j3 6 8;
(3) αK = 2α1,2,3 + α1,k1 + α2,k2 + α3,k3 + α1,k4 + α2,k5 + α3,k6, for all K = {k1, k2, . . . , k6}

such that 1 6 k1 < k2 < · · · < k6 6 8.

(4) αl = 3α1,2,3 + α2,4 + α3,5 + α1,6 + α2,7 + α3,8 + α1,l, for all l ∈ [8],

where we let αi,i := 0 for all i ∈ [8]. We are therefore in a position to describe explicitly the
partial order ≺ on T . Let i < j, h < k, J = {j1, j2, j3} with j1 < j2 < j3, J ′ = {j′
2, j′

Therefore we can also explicitly determine the sets D(w) for all w ∈ E8.

Proposition 4.1. Let w ∈ E8 and x ∈ Cw = w−1(C0). Then

si,j ∈ D(w) ⇔ xi − xj > 0, for all i < j;

sH ∈ D(w) ⇔

Σ(x) − ΣH (x) > 0, for all H ⊂ [8], |H| = 3, 6;

Our next target is to give, for any reﬂection t ∈ T , an explicit description of the map
r 7→ rt and of the set D(t). We state without proof the following two easy lemmas for future
reference.

Lemma 4.2. Let l ∈ [8] and H ⊂ [8], |H| = 3, 6. Then

• Σ(sl(x)) = Σ(x) − 9xl;

where

• ΣH (sl(x)) = ΣH (x) −(cid:0)|H| + χ(l ∈ H)(cid:1)xl,
χ(l ∈ H) =(1

if l ∈ H

0 otherwise.

Lemma 4.3. Let H, H ′ ⊂ [8] with |H|, |H ′| = 3, 6. Then

• Σ(sH (x)) = (|H| − 1)Σ(x) − |H|ΣH(x);

• ΣH ′(sH(x)) = ΣH ′(x) + |H ∩ H ′|(cid:16) |H|

9 Σ(x) − ΣH(x)(cid:17)

For H, H ′ ⊂ [8] we denote by H△H ′ := (H ∪ H ′) \ (H ∩ H ′) the symmetric diﬀerence of

H and H ′, and by ¯H = [8] \ H the complement set of H.

Proposition 4.4. Let l ∈ [8], L = {l} and H ⊂ [8], |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6. Then

if either |H ∩ L| = 0 and |H| 6= 1 or H = L,
if |H ∩ L| = 0 and |H| = 1 or |H ∩ L| = 1 and |H| = 2,
if |H ∩ L| = 1 and |H| = 3, 6,

D(sl) = {sh,l, sh, h < l} ∪ {sH : |H| = 3, 6 and l ∈ H} ∪ {sl}.

Proof. The description of the map r 7→ rsl is a straightforward veriﬁcation. We prove it in one
signiﬁcant case only, leaving the details of all the other cases. We consider the case sJ with
|J| = 3 and L ⊂ J. We have to prove that ssL
J = s ¯J△L and for this it is enough to show that
sL(HsJ ) ⊂ Hs ¯H△L, where we recall that we denote by Hr the reﬂecting hyperplane associated
to a reﬂection r. So let x ∈ HsJ , i.e. such that 1
3Σ(x) − ΣJ (x) = 0. We have, by Lemma
4.2, Σ(sL(x)) = Σ(x) − 9xl and Σ ¯J△L(sL(x)) = Σ ¯J△L(x) − 7xl = (Σ(x) − ΣJ (x) + xl) − 7xl.
Therefore

2

Σ(sL(x) − Σ ¯J△L(sL(x)) = 0,

i.e. sL(x) ∈ Hs ¯H△L.

We therefore proceed with the study of D(sl). We let x ∈ C0. Let h ∈ [8], h 6= l. We
have sh ∈ D(sl) if and only if (sl(x))h = xh − xl < 0 and this is satisﬁed if and only if h < l.
Therefore, for h < l, sh ∈ D(tl). Since ssl
h = sh,l we also have sh,l ∈ D(sl). Similarly, sh and
sl,h are not elements in D(sl) if h > l.

If |H| = 2, 3, 6 and l /∈ H we have that sH and sl commute and so sH /∈ D(sl) by Corollary

2.4.

If l ∈ J ⊂ [8], with |J| = 3 we have sJ ∈ D(sl) if and only if 1

where we have used the simple observation ΣJ (x) + Σ ¯J △L(x) = Σ(x) + xl. The result follows
since x ∈ C0.

If l ∈ J ⊂ [8], with |J| = 6 the result follows since stl

J = s ¯J△L and | ¯J△L| = 3.

The proofs of the following three results, Propositions 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 are very similar to

the proof of Proposition 4.4 and hence they are omitted.

Proposition 4.6. Let J, H ⊂ [8], |J| = 3, |H| = 1, 2, 3, 6. Then

if (|H ∩ J|, |H|) = (0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 6), (1, 3), (3, 3)

An immediate consequence of Propositions 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 is the following.

Corollary 4.8. Let r, t be reﬂections such that r ∈ D(t). Then r (cid:22) t.

Proof. Simple veriﬁcation.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.9. Let u, v ∈ E8 be such that AD(u, v) 6= ∅ and let t be a minimal element in
AD(u, v). Then for all r ∈ D(t) \ {t} we have

r ∈ A(u) ⇔ r ∈ A(v) ⇔ rt ∈ D(v) ⇔ rt ∈ D(u).

Proof. By Lemma 4.8 we have r, rt ≺ t and so by the minimality of t we have that r ∈ A(u)
implies r ∈ A(v) and rt ∈ D(v) implies rt ∈ D(u). Therefore we only have to prove that
r ∈ A(v) implies rt ∈ D(v) and that rt ∈ D(u) implies r ∈ A(u). Let x be any point in Cu
and y be any point in Cv. We proceed case by case.

(1) t = sl, r = sh,l, with h < l and so rt = sh.

If sh,l ∈ A(v) we have yh < yl. Since sl ∈ D(v) we have yl < 0 and therefore yh < 0, i.e.
sh ∈ D(v). Finally, if sh ∈ D(u) we have xh < 0 and this, together with xl > 0 implies
sh,l ∈ A(u).

If sJ ∈ A(v), since sl ∈ D(v) we have 1

3σ(y) − ΣJ (y) < 0 and yl < 0. We have

3Σ(y) − ΣK(y) > 0. Since
3Σ(y) − ΣK(y) > 0
3Σ(x) − ΣK△I(x) > 0

If sI ∈ A(v) we have yi < yj and since sK ∈ D(v) we also have 2
ΣK△I(y) = ΣK(y) − yj + yi < ΣK(y) we deduce that 2
since sK ∈ D(v) and so sK△I ∈ D(v). Finally, if sK△I ∈ D(u) we have 2

3Σ(x) − ΣK(x) < 0 we obtain xj − xi > 0, i.e. si,j∈A(u).

3Σ(y) − ΣK△I(y) > 2

(4) t = sK, with |K| = 6 and r = sJ with |J| = 3 and J ⊂ K and so rt = sK△J.

If sJ ∈ A(v) we have 1
By subtracting these inequalities we obtain 1
Finally, if sK△J ∈ D(u) we have 1
have 2

3 Σ(y)−ΣJ (y) < 0 and since sK ∈ D(v) we also have 2

3Σ(y)−ΣK(y) > 0.
3Σ(y) − ΣK(y) + ΣJ (y) > 0, i.e. sK△J ∈ D(v).
3Σ(x) − ΣK(x) + ΣJ (x) > 0 and since sK ∈ A(u) we also

3 Σ(x) − ΣK(x) < 0 and subtracting these inequalities we conclude

Σ(x) − ΣJ (x) < 0,

i.e. sJ ∈ A(u).

(5) t = si,j, r = si,h with i < h < j and rt = sh,j.

If si,h ∈ A(v) we have yi < yh and since si,j ∈ D(v) we also have yi > yj and therefore yh > yj,
i.e. sh,j ∈ D(v).

The proof is now complete as the statement for a reﬂection r is equivalent to the same
(cid:3)

statement for the reﬂection rt.

Proposition 4.10. Let u, v ∈ E8 be such that AD(u, v) 6= ∅ and let t be a minimal element
in AD(u, v). If t /∈ S then there exists s ∈ S such that

• s ∈ D(t);
• st is minimal in AD(us, vs).
• st = ts;

Moreover, s ∈ DR(u) if and only if s ∈ DR(v).

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

Proof. We show the existing element s for any reﬂection t, leaving all the details of the proof.
If t = si,j with j > i + 1 we can choose s = sj−1,j ∈ D(si,j) (see Proposition 4.7) and so
st = si,j−1.

If t = sJ with |J| = 3 but J 6= {1, 2, 3} let i be minimal such that i /∈ J and i + 1 ∈ J.

Then we can choose s = si,i+1 (see Proposition 4.6) and so st = sJ△{i,i+1}.

If t = s1,2,3,4,5,6 we can choose s = s1,2,3 (see Proposition 4.5) and so st = s4,5,6.
If t = sK with K 6= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} let i be minimal such that i /∈ K and i + 1 ∈ K. Then

we can choose s = si,i+1 (see Proposition 4.5) and so st = sK△{i,i+1}.

If t = s1 we can choose s = s1,2,3 (see Proposition 4.4) and so st = s1,4,5,6,7,8;
If t = sl with l > 1 we can choose s = si−1,i (see Proposition 4.4) and so st = si−1.

5. Affine Weyl groups

In this section we develope some tools in the theory of aﬃne Weyl groups that will be
needed in the study of the generalized lifting property in these groups. An aﬃne Weyl group
ˆW can be realized in the following way (see [8, Chapter 4] for more details). Let (W, S) be
a ﬁnite crystallographic Coxeter system acting as a ﬁnite reﬂection group on a vector space
V , T its set of reﬂections and n := |S|; a corresponding aﬃne group is the group of aﬃne
transformations generated by (aﬃne) reﬂections t(k) through all the hyperplanes of the form
Ht(k) = {x ∈ V | φt(x) = k}, where t ∈ T , k ∈ Z and φt(x) = 0 is the equation of the
hyperplane ﬁxed by t. We assume that the linear functions φt are chosen in such way that
the fundamental chamber C0 of (W, S) sits in the halfspace H +
:= {x : φt(x) > 0} for all
t ∈ T . We also let ˆT := {t(k) : t ∈ T, k ∈ Z} be the set of (aﬃne) reﬂections of ˆW .
t(k) := {x ∈ Rn| φt(x) > k} and H −

t(k) := {x ∈
Rn| φt(x) < k}. The connected components of Rn \ H are called alcoves. The fundamental
t(1); it results

Let H := {Ht(k)| t ∈ T, k ∈ Z} and deﬁne H +

alcove A0 is obtained by intersecting C0 with the intersection of halfspaces Tt∈T

that

H −

t

A0 = C0 ∩ H −

,

(1)
t
0

where t0 is the maximum in (T, (cid:22)) (see [8, Section 4.3]).

The aﬃne Weyl group ˆW acts simply transitively on the set of alcoves and therefore we

identify an element w ∈ ˆW with the corresponding alcove Aw := w−1(A0).

Moreover, we associate to any pair of alcoves A, B an integer

d(A, B) := |{H ∈ H : H separates A and B}|.

A sequence of alcoves A0, . . . , Am is called a gallery of length m if for all i we have

d(Ai, Ai+1) = 1. One has (see [8, Theorem 4.5]):
Proposition 5.1. Let w ∈ ˆW . Then

(1) ℓ(w) = d(A0, Aw);
(2) ℓ(w) = the length of the shortest gallery between A0 and Aw;
(3) t(k) ∈ D(w) if and only if the hyperplane Ht(k) separates A0 from Aw.
If t ∈ T and k ∈ Z, let Str(t(k)) be the hyperstripe deﬁned by Str(t(k)) := H +

{x ∈ Rn : k − 1 < φt(x) < k + 1}.

t(k−1) ∩ H −

t(k+1) =

14

FABRIZIO CASELLI AND PAOLO SENTINELLI

Proposition 5.2. Let A, B be alcoves such that A, B 6∈ Str(t(k)). Then

|d(A, B) − d(A, t(k)(B))| > 3.

Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that φt(x) < k − 1 for all x ∈ A and
φt(y) > k + 1 for all y ∈ B. Let A = A0, A1, . . . , Ad = B be a minimal gallery joining A to
B and let i be the (unique) index in [d] such that φt(x) < k for all x ∈ Ai and φt(y) > k for
all y ∈ Ai+1. Then t(k)(Ai) = Ai+1 and therefore

A = A0, A1, . . . , Ai, t(k)(Ai+2), . . . , t(k)(Ad) = t(k)(B)

is a gallery joining A and t(k)(B) of length d − 1. Nevertheless this gallery is not minimal as
it crosses the hyperplane Ht(k−1) twice, as both A and t(k)(B) are contained in H −
t(k−1) while
Ai ∈ H +
(cid:3)

t(k−1), and the result follows.

The following result will be used to show that in any inﬁnite Coxeter group there is a

Bruhat interval for which the generalized lifting property does not hold.

Proposition 5.3. A chamber C cannot be covered by a ﬁnite number of hyperstripes.

Proof. Is is well-known that Rn is not a union of a ﬁnite number of hyperplanes and so the
same hold for C. So let x ∈ C such that φt(x) 6= 0 for all t ∈ T . As all φt are linear it is clear
that for every a ∈ R there exists c > 0 such that φt(cx) > a for all t ∈ T . As cx ∈ C for all
c > 0 the result follows.
(cid:3)

6. The generalized lifting property

The lifting property stated in Proposition 2.1 does not ensure that for a Bruhat interval
[u, v] there exists a simple reﬂection s ∈ DR(v) \ DR(u) such that u ⊳ us 6 v and u 6 vs ⊳ v.
Of course, if DR(v) ⊆ DR(u), such an s does not exist; in general one can hope that there
exists a reﬂection t ∈ AD(u, v) for which u ⊳ ut 6 v and u 6 vt ⊳ v. This is called the
generalized lifting property (GLP) of the interval [u, v] and [10, Theorem 3.3] asserts that in
the symmetric groups An the GLP holds for every interval. Clearly, by Proposition 2.1, an
interval of the type [e, u] has the GLP, for every u > e, and, in ﬁnite groups, the same happens
for intervals of the type [u, w0], for every u < w0, where w0 denote the unique element of
maximal length.

The following example shows that this is not the case in general.

Example 6.1. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter group of rank 2 with S = {s, t} and ms,t > 4 (for
example the Weyl group of type B2). Consider the elements u = s and v = sts. Then
ℓ(u, v) = 2 and [u, v] = {s, st, ts, sts}. Therefore AD(u, v) = {sts, ststs} but ℓ(uststs) = 4 >
ℓ(u) + 1 and ℓ(vsts) = 0 < ℓ(v) − 1.

The example above shows that there is an interval in any Coxeter group which is not

simply-laced for which the GLP does not hold.

The following theorems aﬃrm that every interval in a ﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter groups,

i.e. a direct product of Weyl groups of type An, Dn, E6, E7 and E8, has the GLP.

Theorem 6.2 (Covering property). Let W be a ﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter system, u, v ∈ W
be such that AD(u, v) 6= ∅ and t be a minimal element in AD(u, v). Then u ⊳ ut and v ⊲ vt.

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

15

Proof. If W = W1 ×W2 is a direct product of two Coxeter groups the set of reﬂections of W is
given by the union of the sets of reﬂections of W1 and W2 and we deduce that we can assume
that W is irreducible. Morevoer, we observe that if the statement is valid for a Coxeter group
W then it holds also for every parabolic subgroup of W and so it is suﬃcient to prove the
result for the groups Dn and E8 only.

To show that u ⊳ ut we have to prove that ℓ(u) = ℓ(ut) − 1 and for this it is enough to
show that there exists a bijection φ : D(u) → D(ut) \ {t}. The bijection φ is the restriction
to D(u) of the following involution on T : we let

φ(r) =(rt,

r,

if r ∈ A(t),
otherwise,

for all r ∈ T .

The map φ is a bijection on T by Lemma 2.5 and so to conclude we have to prove that if

r 6= t then

(7)
First assume r ∈ D(t), and so also rt ∈ D(t) by Lemma 2.5. By Proposition 2.3 applied to rt
we have rt ∈ D(u) if and only if r ∈ A(ut). By Theorems 3.6 and 4.9 we also have rt ∈ D(u)
if and only if r ∈ A(u) and therefore Eq. (7) follows in this case.

r ∈ D(u) ⇔ φ(r) ∈ D(ut).

If r ∈ A(t) all the statements of Proposition 2.3 are false and in particular we have that

(7) is implied by the negation of condition (3) in Proposition 2.3.

The result for v follows similarly by observing that φ restricts to a bijection

φ : D(v) \ {t} → D(vt).

(cid:3)

We note that the covering property (Theorem 6.2) does not require that u 6 v.

Theorem 6.3 (Generalized lifting property). Let (W, S) be a ﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter
system, u, v ∈ W , u < v and t be a minimal element in AD(u, v). Then u ⊳ ut 6 v and
u 6 vt ⊳ v.

Proof. Once again it is suﬃcient to prove the result for the groups Dn and E8. By Theorem
6.2 we only have to show that ut 6 v and u 6 vt. We proceed by induction on the partial
order ≺ on reﬂections. If t is minimal in T then t ∈ S and the result follows by Proposition
2.1. Otherwise choose s ∈ S as in Propositions 3.7 and 4.10. Since st ∈ D(t) we have st ≺ t
by Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.8 and we can apply our induction hypothesis to the pair
(us, vs). It follows that usst < vs or, as the third points in Propositions 3.7 and 4.10 show,
uts < vs. To deduce that ut 6 v it is enough to prove that s ∈ D(ut) if and only if s ∈ D(v).
But s ∈ D(t) and so s ∈ D(ut) if and only if st ∈ A(u) by Proposition 2.3 and hence the
result follows from Theorems 3.6 and 4.9. The proof of u < vt is similar.

(cid:3)

The next proposition generalizes the result stated in Proposition 2.7.

Proposition 6.4. Let [u, v] be a Bruhat interval in a ﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter group and
t a minimal element in AD(u, v). Then

Ru,v = qRut,vt + (q − 1)Ru,vt.

16

FABRIZIO CASELLI AND PAOLO SENTINELLI

Proof. If W = W1 × W2 is a product of two Coxeter groups then u = u1u2 and v = v1v2 with
u1, v1 ∈ W1 and u2, v2 ∈ W2. By [1, Proposition 1.7], we have Ru,v = Ru1,v1Ru2,v2 and since
t ∈ W1∪W2 we can easily deduce that it is enough to prove the statement if W is irreducible; in
particular we can assume that either W = Dn or W = E8 as the other irreducible ﬁnite simply-
laced Coxeter system are parabolic subgroups of these. We prove the result by induction on
the rank function of (T, (cid:22)).
If t ∈ S the result is the recursion (2). Otherwise, choose
s ∈ S as in Lemmas 3.7 and 4.10. Then, since s ∈ DR(v) if and only if s ∈ DR(u), we have
Ru,v = Rus,vs = qRustst,vstst + (q − 1)Rus,vstst = qRuts,vts + (q − 1)Rus,vts = qRut,vt + (q − 1)Ru,vt.
The last equality follows from the fact that v < vs if and only if vt < vts if and only if u < us
if and only if ut < uts.
(cid:3)

The following example shows that the GLP does not hold in general for inﬁnite simply-laced

Coxeter system.
Example 6.5. Let n > 3 and consider the aﬃne Weyl group ˜An, with set of Coxeter gen-
erators S = {s1, s2, ..., sn} (see [2, Section 8.3] for a combinatorial description). Let v =
s1s2 · · · sn−1sns1s2 · · · sn−1 and u = s1s2...sn−1.
In the combinarial description of u and v
as permutations of Z we have v = [v(1), . . . , v(n)] = [3, 4, ..., n, n + 2, −n + 1] and u =
[u(1), . . . , u(n)] = [2, 3, ..., n, 1]. Letting ti = u−1sn · · · si+1sisi+1 · · · snu for all i ∈ [n] one can
check that AD(u, v) = {t1, t2, . . . , tn}. Nevertheless, using the combinatorial interpretation of
the length function in ˜An given in [2, Section 8.3] one can conclude that none of the elements
t1, . . . , tn satisfy the covering property for [u, v] (in particular we have ℓ(uti) > ℓ(u) + 1 for
all i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and ℓ(vtn) < ℓ(v) − 1).

For an inﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter system (W, S), if s ∈ S, the following proposition

shows that any interval of the type [s, u] satisﬁes the GLP.

Proposition 6.6. Let (W, S) be a simply-laced Coxeter system and s ∈ S. Then the GLP
holds for the interval [s, u], for every u > s.

Proof. If DR(u) 6= {s} the result follows by Proposition 2.1. Let DR(u) = {s}; then, since
(W, S) is simply laced, we have that s1...sk−1sks is a reduced expression for u and s 6∈ DR(ussk)
because, otherwise, sk ∈ DR(u). Then the reﬂection t = ssks satisﬁes s ⊳ st 6 u and
s 6 ut ⊳ u.

Our last goal is to show that, in general, Bruhat intervals in inﬁnite simply-laced Coxeter
groups do not satisfy the GLP. Since every inﬁnite Coxeter group has a parabolic subgroup
isomorphic to an aﬃne Weyl group it is enough to consider this class of groups.

The next lemma states that any element in an aﬃne Weyl group is smaller in the Bruhat

order than every element of large enough length.

Lemma 6.7. Let (W, S) be an aﬃne Coxeter system. Then for any u ∈ W there exists n ∈ N
such that u < v for all v ∈ W whose length satisﬁes ℓ(v) > n.

Proof. Since every parabolic subgroup WJ of W is ﬁnite, we let k be the maximum length
If u ∈ W and s1s2...sh is a reduced
of an element in a proper parabolic subgroup of W .
expression for u, consider the number n = h(k + 1). If v ∈ W is any element whose length
satisﬁes ℓ(v) > n, then v should has a reduced expression such as v1v2v3...vh, with ℓ(vi) > k
for all i. In particular vi is not contained in any parabolic subgroups of W and hence si < vi
for all i ∈ [h] and so u < v.

THE GENERALIZED LIFTING PROPERTY OF BRUHAT INTERVALS

Theorem 6.8. Let ( ˆW , S) be an aﬃne Coxeter system and Au be any alcove contained in
the chamber −C0. Then there exists v ∈ ˆW such that u < v but the interval [u, v] does not
satisfy the covering property.

Proof. Let W and T be as in §5. The fundamental alcove is given by the inequalities 0 <
φt(x) < 1 for all t ∈ T .
for
every t ∈ T ; therefore T ⊆ D(u) and {t(1)
t ∈ T } ⊆ A(u). Consider the ﬁnite set
R(u) = {t(k) ∈ ˆT : u ⊳ ut(k)}; by Proposition 5.3, we can ﬁnd an alcove Av ∈ −C0 such that

If A = Au is an alcove in −C0, then it satisﬁes A ∈ H −

:

t

Av 6⊂ [t(k)∈R(u)

Str(t(k)).

Moreover, such element v can be chosen of arbitrary high length (as −C0 \St(k)∈R(u) Str(t(k)

is unbounded), and in particular we can assume that u < v by Lemma 6.7.

Now let t(k) ∈ R(u). It is enough to show that v does not cover vt(k). We already know that
k 6= 0 by construction (since t = t(0) ∈ D(u)) and that t(1) ∈ A(v) by our previous remark.
For k 6= 0, 1 we have that the fundamental alcove A0 is not contained in the hyperstripe
Str(t(k)) and so we can apply Proposition 5.2 to the pair A0 and Av. In particular we have

|ℓ(v) − ℓ(vt(k))| = |d(A0, Av) − d(A0, t(k)(Av))| > 3

and the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

By the theorem above, in every inﬁnite Coxeter group there exists an interval which does
not satisfy the GLP. Therefore with Example 6.1, Theorem 6.3 and Theorem 6.8 we have
proved the following theorem.

Theorem 6.9. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system. The GLP holds for every Bruhat interval
[u, v] in W if and only if (W, S) is ﬁnite and simply-laced.
