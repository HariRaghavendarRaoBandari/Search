CLASSIFICATION OF (cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1)-MANIFOLDS

GESTUR ´OLAFSSON AND ELI ROBLERO-M´ENDEZ

Abstract. Let M be an analytic complete ﬁnite volume pseudo-Riemannian
manifold and fSp(n, R) × fSp(1, R) a connected semisimple Lie group such that
its Lie algebra is sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R). We characterize the structure of the
manifold M assuming that the Lie group fSp(n, R) × fSp(1, R) acts isometrically
on M and that its dimension satisﬁes 3+n(2n+1) < dim(M ) ≤ (n+1)(2n+3).

Introduction

Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group acting isometrically on a
connected analytic manifold M with a pseudo-Riemannian metric of ﬁnite volume.
It has been conjectured that such actions are rigid, in the sense that restrict the
possibilities for M . Such conjecture is consequence of the program proposed by
Robert Zimmer (see **). A principal belief is that such action together with other
non-trivial assumptions imply that M is, basically, the double coset of a semisimple
Lie group H. Speciﬁcally, we have a homomorphism G → H, the existence of a
compact subgroup K ⊂ H, centralizing the image of G, and a lattice Γ ⊂ H such
that M is isometric to Γ\H/K.

Some results have been found in this subject, for example the actions of the

therefore, there is evidence to suppose that the previous conjecture can be true
with other Lie groups not necessarily simple.

In such context we present this research, here we analyze the isometric action of

manifold of ﬁnite volume, assuming that both the action and the manifold are
analytic.

Lie groups SO(p, q) and eU (p, q), where p and q are non-negative integer numbers
(see [8],[9]). Note that in the latter case that the Lie group eU (p, q) is not simple,
the semisimple Lie group(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) on a connected pseudo-Riemannian
In this paper, for any connected manifold N we denote by eN the simple connected

universal covering of N . Let Gi be a non-compact, connected simple Lie group
with Lie algebra gi, i = 1, 2. In this case G := G1 × G2 is a semisimple Lie group
without compact factors with Lie algebra g = g1 ⊕ g2. Let M be a connected,
ﬁnite-volume, pseudo Riemannian manifold which admits an analytic and isometric
G-action with a dense orbit where no factor of G acts trivially. As in [8], we prove
that for M a weakly irreducible and complete manifold there is a lower bound of its
dimension given by the dimension of the semisimple Lie group and the properties
of the representations of its Lie algebra. In other words

dim(M ) ≥ dim(G) + m0(g1, g2)

where m0(g1, g2) denotes the dimension of the smallest non-trivial representation
of both Lie algebras, g1 and g2, preserving a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
form.

As a consequence of our research we have the following theorem who main result
says that such action, together with other conditions on the manifold and the action,
imply that M is isomorphic, up to a ﬁnite covering, to a quotient map of a simple
Lie group over a lattice.

Theorem A. We assume the semisimple Lie group G =(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1), for

n ≥ 3, acts isometrically with a dense orbit on a connected, ﬁnite-volume, complete,
pseudo-Riemannian manifold M , where no factor of G acts trivially. Assume that
M and the G-action on M are both analytic. If M is weakly irreducible and satisﬁes
that dim(M ) = (n + 1)(2n + 3), then there exist:

• a lattice Γ ⊂fSp(n + 1, R), and
• an analytic ﬁnite covering map τ :fSp(n + 1, R)/Γ → M ,

such that τ is(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1)-equivariant. We can also rescale the metric on
M along the fSp(n, R) andfSp(1, R)-orbits and the normal bundle to the(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×
fSp(1, R)(cid:1)-orbits, such that τ is a local isometry for the metric on fSp(n + 1, R) given

by the Killing form of its Lie algebra.

The proof of our principal result is based in the tools developed by Gromov and
Zimmer through the study of the properties of representation of the Killing vector
ﬁelds that centralize the action of the semisimple group. One of our principal tools
is Proposition 1.2, who is a generalization of a similar result in [8] and [10]. Such
proposition shows the existence of a Lie algebra g(x), isomorphic to sp(n, R) ⊕

theory to analyze the normal bundle to the foliation generated by the orbits of the

sp(1, R), of Killing vector ﬁelds vanishing in a point x ∈ fM . Such Lie algebra g(x)
induces a structure of g-module on TxfM which allows the use of representation
action. The g-module structure of TxfM is closely related to a structure of g-module

of H, the set of Killing vector ﬁelds that centralize the action of the group G. Such
structure gives us more tools to understand the properties of H, which instead
gives place to the action of another Lie group on M . The proof of the existence
of the centralizer H of the action can be found Section 1. In Section 2 we analyze
the properties of H and its relation with the tangent space at some point in M .
The new action induced by the centralizer is an important tool for the proof of
Theorem A, which can be found in 3. Meanwhile, in Appendix A we have results

about the representations of fSp(n, R) and its Lie algebra sp(n, R), which are used

in the previous sections.

1. First results

Let G be a semisimple Lie group as in the introduction. We assume that G acts
isometrically with a dense orbit on a connected, ﬁnite-volume, pseudo-Riemannian
manifold M where no factor of G acts trivially. Hence, the G-action is locally
free (see [11, Theorem 4.17]) and its orbits deﬁne a foliation that we denote by
F . We also denote by F1 (resp. F2) the foliation deﬁned by the G1-orbits (resp.
G2-orbits). We consider that M and the G-action on M are both analytic.

the manifold.

For X ∈ g, we denote by X ∗ the vector ﬁeld on the manifold M whose one-

parameter group of diﬀeomorphism is given by(cid:0) exp(tX)t(cid:1) through the action on

For any given pseudo-Riemannian manifold N , we will denote by Kill(N ) the
globally deﬁned Killing vector ﬁelds of N . We denote by Kill0(N, x) the Lie algebra
of Killing vector ﬁelds that vanish at the given point x. For a vector space W with
a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, we will denote by so(W ) the Lie algebra
of linear maps on W that are skew-symmetric with respect to the bilinear form.
The next result is an application of the Jacobi identity.

Lemma 1.1. Let N be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and x ∈ N . Then, the map
λx : Kill0(N, x) → so(TxN ) given by λx(Z)(v) = [Z, V ]x, where V is any vector
ﬁeld such that Vx = v, is a well-deﬁned homomorphism of Lie algebras.

An immediate consequence of the previous result is its use in the proof of the

following proposition which is a generalization of Proposition 1.2 in [8].

Proposition 1.2. Assume that G acts isometrically with a dense orbit on a con-
nected, ﬁnite-volume, pseudo-Riemannian manifold M , where no factor of G acts

M and the G-action on M are both analytic. Then, there exists a conull subset

trivially. Consider the eG-action on fM lifted from the G-action on M . Assume that
S ⊂ fM such that for every x ∈ S the following properties are satisﬁed:
(1) There is a homomorphism ρ : g = g1 ⊕ g2 → Kill(fM ) which is an isomor-
(2) g(x) ⊂ Kill0(fM , x), i.e. every element of g(x) vanishes at x.

phism onto its image ρx(g) = g(x).

(3) For every X, Y ∈ g we have:

[ρx(X), Y ∗] = [X, Y ]∗ = −[X ∗, Y ∗].

In particular, the elements in g(x) and their corresponding local ﬂows pre-
serve F , F1, F2 and T F ⊥.

(4) The homomorphism of Lie algebras λx ◦ ρx : g → so(TxfM ) induces a g-
module structure on TxfM for which the subspaces TxF , TxF1, TxF2 and

(5) For every Xi ∈ gi, i = 1, 2, we have

TxF ⊥ are g-submodules.

[ρx(Xi), X ∗

j ] = [Xi, Xj]∗ = 0 with i 6= j.

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 1.2 in [10]. We only note

Z

that the result: Ad(G)
is the algebraic hull of M × GL(g) for the product action,
is also true for semisimple Lie groups without compact factors (see [13, Example
3.15]).

which imply that u = 0. Since x ∈ S is arbitrary we conclude that TxF = TxF1 ⊕
TxF2, for every x ∈ S.

With the above setup, assume that the Gi-orbits are non-degenerate with respect

to the ambient pseudo-Riemannian metric. In particular, the eGi-orbits on fM are
non-degenerate as well and we have a direct sum decomposition TfM = T Fi ⊕T F ⊥

Proof. The proof is similar as that of Lemma 2.5 in [10], where the simplicity (or
semisimplicity) of the group does not play a role.
(cid:3)

Next, we relate the metric of T F coming from M to suitable metrics on G.

Lemma 1.4 ([10, Lemma 2.6]). Suppose that the G-action on M has a dense orbit
and preserves a ﬁnite-volume pseudo-Riemannian metric. Then, for every x ∈ M
and with respect to the natural isomorphism TxF ∼= g, the metric of M restricted
to TxF deﬁnes and Ad(G)-invariant symmetric bilinear form on g independent of
the point x.

Proof. See the proof at Lemma 2.6 in [10].

(cid:3)

We assume, from now on, that dim(G2) < dim(G1). In this case we have that
the non-degeneracy of orbits is ensured for low-dimensional manifolds by the next
result, which is similar to [10, Lemma 2.7].

Lemma 1.5. Assume that G = G1×G2 acts isometrically and with a dense orbit on
a connected ﬁnite-volume pseudo-Riemannian manifold M . If dim(M ) < 2 dim(G1)
and if the G2-orbits are non-degenerate, then the bundles T F1, T F and T F ⊥ have
ﬁbers that are non-degenerate with respect to the metric on M .

Proof. By Lemma 1.4, for every x ∈ M , the metric h (on M ) restricted to TxF
corresponds to an Ad(G)-invariant form in g. The Kernel of such form is g-invariant,
therefore, since TxFi ≃ gi, ker(hx) is either 0, TxF1, TxF2 or TxF .

Assume that TxF1 ⊆ ker(hx) for some x ∈ M . Then, TxF1 lies in the null
cone of TxF for the metric hx. Hence, for the signature of M , which we denote
as (m, n), we have that dim(G1) = dim(TxF1) ≤ min(m, n). This implies that
2 dim(G1) ≤ m + n = dim(M ), which is impossible.

On the other hand, by hypothesis ker(hx) 6= TxF2. Therefore and the previous
(cid:3)

paragraphs we have the desired result.

Remark 1.6. Let us choose and ﬁx an element x ∈ S. Let Xi ∈ gi be, for i = 1, 2,

The previous computation and Lemma 1.5 imply that TxF is an orthogonal direct

and TxF ⊥.

If the G-orbits are non-degenerate and the normal bundle to such orbits is inte-

grable, then the universal covering space can be split.

g2-module.

For i = 1, 2, let m(gi) be the dimension of the smallest non-trivial representa-
tion of gi that admits an invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form. Since
g = g1 ⊕ g2, we deﬁne m(g) = m(g1, g2) the dimension of the smallest non-trivial
representation of both g1 and g2 that admits an invariant non-degenerate symmet-
ric bilinear form. If we assume that there is a non-trivial homomorphism g2 → g1
then m(g) ≤ m(g1), even more we have that m(g) = m(g1).

From now on we assume the existence of an injective homomorphism g2 → g1.
A consequence of the previous result is the obtention of a lower bound on the
dimension of M .

Proposition 1.9. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
Suppose that M is complete, weakly irreducible, has ﬁnite-volume and admits an
analytic isometric, non-transitive G-action with a dense orbit and such that no
factor acts trivially. We also assume that the G2-orbits are non-degenerate.
If
m(g) + dim(G2) ≤ dim(G1) then

dim(M ) ≥ dim(G) + m(g).

Proof. Suppose that dim(M ) < dim(G) + m(g). Since m(g) + dim(G2) ≤ dim(G1)
then dim(M ) < 2 dim(G1) and, by Lemma 1.5, the bundle T F ⊥ has non-degenerate
ﬁbers with dimension < m(g). Hence, Lemma 1.8 and the deﬁnition of m(g) imply
that TxF ⊥ is a trivial g1-module for the structure deﬁned by Proposition 1.2(4),
hence Proposition 1.7 contradicts the irreducibility of M .

On a complete manifold every Lie algebra of Killing vector ﬁelds can be realized

and H a simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra h. If ψ : h → Kill(N ) is
a homomorphism of Lie algebras, then there exists an isometric right H-action
N × H → N such that ψ(X) = X ∗, for every X ∈ h. Furthermore, if N is analytic,
then the H-action is analytic as well.

Given the assumptions in the previous paragraph, by Lemma 1.5, we have the

Proof. Since we are assuming that M is weakly irreducible, by Lemma 1.8, we have
that for almost every x ∈ S, TxF ⊥ is a non-trivial sp(n, R)-module (respectively

By Proposition 1.2(4) and Lemma 1.5 we have that the map λx ◦ ρx induces
a non-trivial homomorphism of Lie algebras from sp(n, R) (resp. sp(1, R)) into
so(TxF ⊥). Since sp(n, R) (resp. sp(1, R)) is a simple Lie algebra we have that such

= [ρx(Y ), [ρx(X), U ]]x

= (cid:0)(λx ◦ ρx)(Y ) ◦ (λx ◦ ρx)(X)(cid:1)(u)

therefore, we have that (λx ◦ ρx)(sp(n, R)) and (λx ◦ ρx)(sp(1, R)) commute each
other in so(TxF ⊥). Hence, the map λx ◦ ρx induces an injective homomorphism of

Lie algebras from(cid:0)sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R)(cid:1) into so(TxF ⊥).

Since TxF ⊥ is a non-trivial sp(n, R)-module preserving a non-degenerate sym-
metric bilinear form then, by Lemma A.7, we have that TxF ⊥ is isomorphic to
R2n ⊕ R2n as sp(n, R)-module. Let {e1, e2, . . . , en, en+1, en+2, . . . , en+n} be the
canonical base of R2n. Let i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} be such that i 6= j, by the repre-
sentation of sp(n, R) on R2n we can ﬁnd Ai,j ∈ sp(n, R) such that Ai,j(ei) = ei
and Ai,j(ej) = ej, therefore if h·, ·i is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on
R2n ⊕ R2n preserved by sp(n, R) then

0 = hAi,j (ei), eji + hei, Ai,j(ej)i = hei, eji + hei, eji = 2hei, eji.

Hence, a subspace of dimension 2n is contained in the nullcone of h·, ·i therefore we
have that the signature of h·, ·i is (2n, 2n).

a subspace W0(x) complementary to G(x) ⊕ H0(x) in H.

Deﬁne H0(x) = ker(evx). By Lemma 1.11, we have that H0(x) is an(cid:0)sp(n, R) ⊕

It follows from the proof of Lemma 2.2 that G(x) ⊕ H0(x) is a Lie subalgebra

map f :(cid:0)fSp(n + 1, R), K(cid:1) → (fM ,eg) is an isometry, where K is the metric
on fSp(n + 1, R) induced by the Killing form of its Lie algebra.
First, by the results in [4] we have that Iso(fSp(n + 1, R)) has ﬁnite many com-
ponents and that Iso0(fSp(n + 1, R)) = L(fSp(n + 1, R))R(fSp(n + 1, R)), where L(g)
(resp. R(g)) is the left (resp. right) translation map onfSp(n + 1, R) by the element
g ∈fSp(n + 1, R).
Let ̺ :fSp(n, R)×fSp(1, R) → Iso0(fSp(n+1, R)) be the homomorphism generated
by the left action of(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) on fSp(n + 1, R). By the previous para-
graph, there are two homomorphism ̺L, ̺R : fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R) → fSp(n + 1, R)
such that ̺(h) = L(̺L(h))R(̺R(h)) for every h ∈(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1).
Since the right fSp(n + 1, R)-action and the left action of(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1)
onfSp(n + 1, R) commute each other then ̺R(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) lies in the center
offSp(n + 1, R), such property and the fact that(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) is connected
imply that ̺R(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) = e. Therefore ̺ = L ◦ ̺L.
the subgroup Σ0 = π1(M ) ∩ Iso0(fSp(n + 1, R)) (since π1(M ) ⊂ Iso(fSp(n + 1, R)))
has ﬁnite index in π1(M ). Considering that the action of(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1) on
fSp(n + 1, R) is the lift of an action on M we have that the elements in Σ0 commute
with the elements of ̺(cid:0)fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)(cid:1). Therefore, since σ0 = L(σ1)R(σ2) for
some σ1, σ2 ∈ Σ then L(σ1)◦ L(̺L(h)) = L(̺L(h))◦ L(σ1) for every h ∈(cid:0)fSp(n, R)×

index in L(ZfSp(n+1,R)(fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)))R(fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)). In particular,
Σ = Σ0 ∩ R(fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)) is a ﬁnite index subgroup of Σ0, and therefore it
The natural identiﬁcation of R(fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)) with fSp(n, R) ×fSp(1, R)

Recall that gl2n(R) = sl(2n, R) ⊕ R then, by above, we have that gl(2n, R) =

Lemma A.2. There is, up to isomorphism, an unique inclusion of sp(n, R) ⊕
sp(1, R) into so(2n, 2n).

Proof. Since (sl(2n, R), sp(n, R)) and (so(2n, 2n), sl(2n, R)⊕R) are symmetric pairs
we have an inclusion of sp(n, R) into so(2n, 2n). By the previous paragraphs we
have that such inclusion induces a decomposition of so(2n, 2n) into a direct sum of

Lemma A.1 shows that the inclusion of sp(n, R) into so(2n, 2n), is unique up to
isomorphism. On the other hand, by the simplicity of sp(1, R) and since the inclu-
sion of sp(1, R) into so(2n, 2n) is contained in Zso(2n,2n)(sp(n, R)) (the centralizer
of sp(n, R) in so(2n, 2n)) then we have that the inclusion of sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R) into
so(2n, 2n) is unique up to isomorphism.

An immediate consequence of the previous lemma is the following corollary.

Corollary A.3. With the above inclusion of sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R) into so(2n, 2n),

given in Lemma A.2, we have that R2n,2n is an irreducible (cid:0)sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R)(cid:1)-

module.

Next, we analyze the representations of sp(n, R) through the study of their cor-

respondent complexiﬁcation, all these facts can be found in [7].

Let g0 be an real Lie algebra and let ρ : g0 → gl(V0) be a representation of
g0 in a real vector space V0. Let us denote V = V0(C) and g = g0(C). Here,
we have two complexiﬁcation operations related to ρ. First, we have a complex
representation ρC : g0 → gl(V ), obtained extending any ρ(x), x ∈ g0, to a complex
linear operator in V . Second, we can extend ρC to a homomorphism of complex
Lie algebras ρ(C) : g → gl(V ).

The following result uses the previous complex representations and it gives a

classiﬁcation of irreducible real representations.

Theorem A.4 ([7, Th 1, Sect. 8]). Any irreducible real representation ρ : g0 →
gl(V0) of a real Lie algebra g0 satisﬁes precisely on of the following two conditions:

(i) ρC is an irreducible complex representation;
(ii) ρ = ρ′

R, where ρ′ is an irreducible complex representation admitting no

invariant real structures.

Conversely, any real representation ρ satisfying (i) or (ii) is irreducible.

Let ρ : g0 → gl(V ) be a self-conjugate irreducible complex representation. The
Cartan Index of ρ is ε(ρ) = sgn(c) = ±1, where c is deﬁned by the following
condition: S2 = ce, where S is an automorphism of V commuting with ρ. By
the results in Section 8 in [7], we have that an irreducible complex representation
ρ : g → gl(V ) admits an invariant real structure if and only if ρ is self-conjugate
and its Cartan index is equal to 1.

By Theorem 3 in Section 8 and Table 5 in [7] we have that the irreducible complex
representations of sp(n, R) are self-conjugate and their Cartan index is always 1.
Therefore, the study of real irreducible representations of sp(n, R) is similar to the
study of irreducible complex representations of sp(n, C).

From Section 5.5.2 in [3] we have a bijection between (ﬁnite) complex repre-
sentations of a complex semisimple Lie algebra g and the set of dominant in-
tegral weights associated to g. The dominant integral weights are of the form
n1̟1 + n2̟2 + · · · + nk̟k with nk ∈ N, where ̟1, ̟2, . . . , ̟k are the fundamental
weights of g.

It is clear that the dimension of the representation associated to n1̟1 + n2̟2 +
· · · + nk̟k is bigger or equal to the dimension of the representation associated to
nj̟j and this, if nj 6= 0, to the dimension of the representation associated to ̟j,
for every j ∈ {1, 2, . . . k}.

In our case, g = sp(n, C), and therefore for g0 = sp(n, R) we have that the

fundamental weights are ̟1, ̟2, . . . , ̟n.

Lemma A.5. The dimension of the representation of sp(n, R) associated to ̟j is
bigger that 4n when n ≥ 3 and 2 ≤ j ≤ n.

Proof. By Corollary 5.5.17 in [3] we have that the dimension of the complex repre-
sentation of sp(n, C) associated to ̟j, and hence the real representation of sp(n, R)

associated to ̟j, is (cid:0)2n

Remark A.6. First, by the deﬁnition of sp(n, R), we have that the representation of
sp(n, R) on R2n, corresponding to its highest weight ̟1, preserves a non-degenerate

skew-symmetric bilinear form. Hence, such representation cannot preserve a non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form. On the other hand, recall that the represen-
tation of sp(n, R) on R corresponds to the trivial homomorphism.

With the observations in Remark A.6 and Lemma A.5 we can now show a rep-
resentation of sp(n, R) with the minimal dimension preserving a non-degenerate
symmetric bilinear form.

Lemma A.7. The minimal dimension of a non-trivial representation of sp(n, R)
which preserves a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form is 4n, even more, such
representation is isomorphic, as sp(n, R)-module, to R2n ⊕ R2n.

Proof. Let V be a non-trivial representation of sp(n, R) which preserves a non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form. By Lemma A.5 and Remark A.6 we have that
dim(V ) = r ≥ 2n.

If dim(V ) = 2n then, by Lemma A.5 and Remark A.6, we have that V ≃ R2n
(as sp(n, R)-module) which can not preserve a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear
form.

If 2n + 1 ≤ dim(V ) ≤ 4n − 1 then, by Lemma A.5 and Remark A.6, we have that
j=1 R. Let h·, ·i be the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on
j=1 R induced by its homomorphism with V , note that h, i is preserved
j=1 R we have that for every

V ≃ R2n ⊕Lr−2n
R2n ⊕Lr−2n

by the action of sp(n, R). Here, if x ∈ R2n and h ∈ ⊕r−2n
A ∈ sp(n, R)

0 = hA · x, hi + hx, A · hi = hA · x, hi + hx, 0i = hA · x, hi.

Because the elements have been taken arbitrarily, that implies that h·, ·i is non-
degenerated when is restricted to R2n, which is not possible. Thence, resuming
dim(V ) ≥ 4n.

then there is a non-trivial representation of sp(n, R), with dimension 4n, preserving
a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form.

Since (cid:0)sl(2n, R), sp(n, R)(cid:1) and (cid:0)so(2n, 2n), sl(2n, R) ⊕ R(cid:1) are symmetric pairs
R2n ⊕L2n

If dim(V ) = 4n then, by Lemma A.5, V must be isomorphic to R2n ⊕ R2n,
j=1 R. The last two options are not possible as is shown

previously. Therefore we have that V is isomorphic to R2n ⊕ R2n.

And as consequence of the previous result and Corollary A.3 we have the next

lemma.

Lemma A.8. The decomposition of sp(n + 1, R) as a direct sum of irreducible

(cid:0)sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R)(cid:1)-modules is given as sp(n + 1, R) = sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R) ⊕ R2n,2n.

Proof. Recall, by [1], that (sp(n+ 1, R), sp(n, R)⊕ sp(1, R)) is a symmetric pair. On
the other hand, since any Cartan involution on sp(n, R)⊕sp(1, R) can be extended to
a Cartan involution on sp(n+1, R) and all Cartan involution are conjugates we have
then that the complement of sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R) in sp(n + 1, R) is a non-degenerated

vector subspace with dimension 4n which is a non-trivial (cid:0)sp(n, R) ⊕ sp(1, R)(cid:1)-
