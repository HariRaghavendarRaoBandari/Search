THREE-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATIONS OF LONG DURATION GAMMA-RAY BURST JETS: TIME SCALES

FROM VARIABLE ENGINES

Draft version March 10, 2016

ABSTRACT

Gamma-ray burst light curves are characterized by marked variability, each showing unique prop-
erties. The origin of such variability, at least for a fraction of long GRBs, may be the result of an
unsteady central engine. It is thus important to study the eﬀects that an episodic central engine has
on the jet propagation and, eventually, on the prompt emission within the collapsar scenario. Thus, in
this study we follow the interaction of pulsed outﬂows with their progenitor stars with hydrodynamic
numerical simulations in both two and three dimensions. We show that the propagation of unsteady
jets is aﬀected by the interaction with the progenitor material well after the break-out time, especially
for jets with long quiescent times, comparable to or larger than a second. We also show that this
interaction can lead to an asymmetric behavior in which pulse durations and quiescent periods are
systematically diﬀerent. After the pulsed jets drill through the progenitor and the interstellar medium,
we ﬁnd that, on average, the quiescent epochs last longer than the pulses (even in simulations with
symmetrical active and quiescent engine times). This could explain the asymmetry detected in the
light curves of long-quiescent times duration gamma-ray bursts.

1. INTRODUCTION

All the observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves
(LCs) are characterized by temporal variability (Walker
et al. 2000), and some GRBs present pulses separated
by quiescent time intervals lasting from fractions of a sec-
ond to several tens of seconds (Fenimore & Ramirez-Ruiz
2000; Borgonovo et al. 2007). Most, if not all the vari-
ability is ascribed to the fact that the relativistic outﬂow
is injected by an unsteady central engine that produces
outﬂows with varying rest-frame density, Lorentz factor,
luminosity, magnetization, or of a combination of them
(Piran 1990; Rees & Meszaros 1994; Ramirez-Ruiz &
Merloni 2001; Ramirez-Ruiz et al.
2001). Additional
variability can be introduced by the interaction of the
outﬂow with the progenitor star (Morsony et al. 2010),
by turbulence (Narayan & Kumar 2009), or by magnetic
reconnection (e.g. the ICMART model, Zhang & Yan
(2011); Zhang & Zhang (2014)).

Nakar & Piran (2002) (NP02) analyzed the GRB
dataset from the BATSE 4B catalogue, speciﬁcally the
temporal behavior of the 68 brightest long GRBs. The
total number of pulses and quiescent times in these bright
bursts was in total 1330 and 1262 (respectively). NP02
ﬁnd that the pulses follow a lognormal distribution while
the intervals do not and conclude that the pulses and qui-
escent epochs come from diﬀerent mechanisms. Whether
the pulses and quiescent periods can be due to the same
mechanism or not remains to be fully studied. In partic-
ular, NP02 did not take into account the fact that the jet

propagation through the progenitor star can modify the
temporal variability injected by the engine (e.g., Mor-
sony et al.
(2011)). To shed
more light on this phenomenon, we performed a series of
two- and three-dimensional simulations in which a cen-
tral engine injects an unsteady outﬂow at the center of
a massive progenitor star. We follow the jet as it prop-
agates through the progenitor star and the interstellar
medium (ISM) and eventually calculate LCs and study
the behavior of pulses and intervals in between.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst describe
the simulation setup, and the numerical models in Sec-
tion 2, followed by discussion of our results in Section 3.
Conclusions are given in Section 4.

2. SIMULATIONS SETUP AND NUMERICAL

MODELS

We performed a series of three-dimensional (3D) and
two-dimensional (2D) simulations, each consisting of a
variable GRB jet drilling through the stellar progeni-
tors envelope and then through the interstellar medium
(ISM). All simulations were performed using the hydro-
dynamic code FLASH (version 2.5) in Cartesian (3D)
or cylindrical (2D) coordinates (Fryxell et al.
2000).
The setup was analogous to the one in L´opez-C´amara et
al.
(2013), but the jets studied in this work are inter-
mittent, produced by engines with a diverse set of duty
cycles. Given the computational demand in order to fol-
low the jet propagation in 3D and the need of exploring
a big parameter space, several two-dimensional models
were also run, this after verifying their reliability against
the 3D results.

In 3D, jets from four intermittent engines with dif-
ferent active/quiescent periods were modeled. The en-
gine period was constant through the simulation and
the engines were characterized by square pulses with ac-
tive and quiescent durations equal to each other. The
numerical setup was very similar to that from L´opez-

2

Lopez-Camara et al.

C´amara et al.
(2013). The variable jet had aver-
age luminosity (cid:104)L(cid:105) = 5 × 1050 erg s−1, opening angle
θ0 = 10o,
initial Lorentz factor Γ0=5, ratio of inter-
nal over rest-mass energy η0=80 (with which Γ∞=400),
and was launched from the core of the progenitor (at
rin=109 cm). The stellar progenitor, model 16TI from
Woosley & Heger
(2006), was immersed in a constant
density ISM (ρism=10−10 g cm−3). Engines with period
T =0.2, 1, 2, and 4 s were simulated. Real GRB engines
are likely characterized by faster variability, but we could
not reduce the period without making the time step pro-
hibitively small for the full 3D simulations. A control
simulation was also run with a jet that was always ac-
tive, and in order to check for resolution eﬀects an extra
simulation, akin to the 3D variable jet model with a 0.1s
period, was performed but with the entire cocoon been
solved with the ﬁnest resolution grid level (indicated as
“HR”).

2008; L´opez-C´amara et al.

The numerical domain of the 3D simulations covered
the top half of the pre-SN progenitor star as well as
the ISM it is immersed in. The boundaries were set at
2.56×1011 cm along the polar axis (Y-axis in the ﬁgures)
and ±6.4×1010 cm in the equatorial plane (XZ-axis).
Eleven levels of reﬁnement were used with which the
ﬁnest grid level resolution was ∆=7.81×106 cm, which
is comparable or even an order of magnitude ﬁner than
previous 3D collapsar studies (Zhang et al. 2004; Wang
et al.
2013; Bromberg &
Tchekhovskoy 2016; Ito et al. 2015), and comparable
with two-dimensional GRB-jet studies (Zhang et al.
2003, 2004; Morsony et al. 2007, 2010; Lazzati et al.
2009; Nagakura et al. 2011; Lazzati et al. 2012; Mizuta
& Ioka 2013). The base of the jet (Y<0.5 rin) was solved
with the ﬁnest resolution grid level, the lower and mid
part of the jet (Y<4 rin) was followed with a resolution
of 2∆, and the rest of the jet was followed with 4∆.
As pointed out in L´opez-C´amara et al.
(2014), when
launching a variable jet from the core of a pre-SN like
progenitor the cocoon must be followed with resolutions
comparable to that from the jet. Thus, the cocoon was
followed with a resolution which covered values as ﬁne
as 4∆ (close to the polar axis) up to 32∆ (far from the
polar axis). In the 3D HR model all of the cocoon was
followed with 4∆.

2004; L´opez-C´amara et al.

3D simulations are very important in order to properly
take into account the jet propagation inside a massive
progenitor (Zhang et al.
2013; Bromberg & Tchekhovskoy 2016; Ito et al. 2015),
none the less they are very time-consuming. Thus, to be
able to explore a wider parameter range and perform a
more meaningful comparison of our results with observa-
tions, we performed a large set of 2D numerical simula-
tions. The ﬁrst set of 2D simulations replicated the 3D
work, with constant square-pulsed intermittent engines
characterized by periods T = 0.2, 1, 2, and 4 s for a total
integration time of 50 s. This set was intended to com-
pare the results of our pulsed jet models between two-
and three-dimensions. The second set of 2D simulations
(twenty in total) had random active and quiescent inter-
val values and was intended to provide a more realistic
comparison with the observations. A summary with the
main characteristics of the models is shown in Table 1.
The 2D simulations were solved with the same resolution

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Three-dimensional models

All

jets in the the 3D models successfully drilled
through the stellar progenitor, broke out of the star, and
evolved through the ISM, eventually leaving the numer-
ical domain. The evolution of one of the pulsed mod-
els through the progenitor and then through the ISM
is shown in Figure 1. Speciﬁcally, we show the den-
sity stratiﬁcation maps (XY, XZ, and YZ planes) for the
T = 1 s model as it drills through the stellar envelope.
It breaks out of the progenitor after 7.8 s, and at 14.60 s
is about to reach the upper polar axis boundary.

The pulsed behavior in all the models is distinguish-
able as density jumps in the jet.
In order to further
show such density jumps, in Figure 2 we show the den-
sity stratiﬁcation map in the XY plane and the radial
density proﬁle along the polar axis for the T = 1 s period
model. The density jumps are present inside the progen-
itor (∼1×1010 cm), in the edge of the pre-SN progenitor
(∼4×1010 cm), and outside the progenitor (∼6×1010 cm,
∼1.2×1011 cm, ∼1.8×1011 cm, and ∼2.1×1011 cm). The
active pulsed epochs of the central engine produces pulses
with low-density regions (with minimum values as low
as ∼10−4-10−5 g cm−3) which drill through the pre-SN
progenitor and propagate over the ISM. The pulses are
separated from each other by quiescent periods with den-
sity values that are at least an order of magnitude higher
(∼100-10−4 g cm−3) than the subsequent pulse.

The 3D pulsed models require more time in order to
break out of the progenitor compared to the model where
the jet was always active, models with a break out time
equal to tbo=5.27 s. The 3D models with T = 0.2, 1, 2,
and 4 s have break out times equal to tbo=11.00s, 7.80s,
6.73s, and 6.80 respectively. These break-out times are
consistent with what has previously been observed in re-
cent 3D GRB jet studies (L´opez-C´amara et al.
2013;
Bromberg & Tchekhovskoy 2016; Ito et al. 2015), with
2D GRB jet studies (Zhang et al. 2003, 2004; Morsony
et al. 2007; Lazzati et al. 2009; Morsony et al. 2010;
Nagakura et al. 2011; Lazzati et al. 2012; Mizuta & Ioka
2013), and with the analytic solution of Bromberg et al.
(2011). Interestingly, the models with longer episodic
periods tend to have shorter break out times and vicev-

ersa (tbo ∝T−0.2). We notice that the break-out time of
the T =0.2s simulations is tbo ∼11 s, independently of
the resolution. This anti-correlation between the period
of the engine and the breakout time is consistent with
results from Morsony et al. (2010) in 2D simulations (a
more thorough comparison between 2D and 3D breakout
times is treated in Section 3.3).

The Lorentz factors (Γ) of the active and quiescent

XY plane overlapped with the density stratiﬁcation maps (same

t=13.93s), m3D2.0lr (at t=13.93s) and m3D4.0lr (at t=12.73s),

times of the 3D models are shown in Figure 3 (we must
note that the timeframes shown were hand-picked in or-
der to have ≈ the same cocoon size and to be able to
compare them). Clearly the variability in the central en-
gine generates high- and low-Γ regions.
In accordance
with L´opez-C´amara et al. (2014), the obtained Γ distri-
bution from the 3D models shows that the active peri-
ods produce low-density and high-Γ regions contrary to
the quiescent periods that have higher density and lower
Γ regions. The T = 4 s model has two active regions
(which reach at least Γ=30) and are separated by a large
quiescent region which has Lorentz factors of order 2.
The T = 2 s model produces 4 pulses with high-Γ (∼20)
separated by low-Γ quiescent epochs. The one second
period model has seven high-Γ regions and the 0.2s pe-
riod models has more than twenty high-Γ regions. The
active regions from the latter two models reach Γ ≥20,
and 10 (respectively). The control model, model with
the central engine active at all times, produced a single
low-density high-Γ region which reached values very sim-
ilar to the T = 4 s (Γ ≥30), thus there is a correlation
between the period of pulses and their average Γ values.
To better understand the correlation between the
pulses T and Γ, in the upper panel of Figure 4, we plot
the pulses average Γ value for each of the 3D models (in-
cluding its ±1σ error bars) for when the jet has reached
2×1011 cm. The best ﬁt line for such correlation (with
R2=0.92) is Γ=13.01Hz×T +0.24. In the middle panel of

stratiﬁcation maps of the XY plane (same as in Figure 3) for models
m3D0.2lr (at t=12.47s) and m3D0.2hr (at t=12.63s) (left and right
panels respectively).

Independently of the turbulence and Γ value diﬀer-
ences, both HR and LR models not only have very similar
tbo but, as can be seen in Figure 5, also show the same
large scale structures. The evolution of the variable jet
is, on large scales, basically the same. The high resem-
blance between the HR and LR three-dimensional models
is further viewed in the top panel of Figure 4 where the
average Γ values of the pulses for both HR and LR models
are within one sigma from each other. Hence, since this
study is devoted into analyzing the grand scale proper-
ties of the 3D variable jet drilling through the progenitor
and ISM we need not require such large ﬁne resolution
regions as the HR case and we can ignore the possible
resolution eﬀects in our LR simulations.
For each 3D episodic model, we estimated the light-
power curves (LPCs) at robs=2.2×1011cm and for an ob-
server lying at 1o from the jet axis. The LPCs were
calculated following the same procedure as in Morsony
et al. (2010), see Figure 6. We must note how the time
shown in the x-axis corresponds to the time elapsed after
the ﬁrst pulse reached robs. The variable jet behavior is
present in the LPCs and the active epochs are character-
ized by luminosities in the range L=1053-1054 erg s−1.
An important feature of the LPCs of Figure 6 is that
the pulse durations are signiﬁcantly smaller than half
the period of the injected variability. This is also no-
ticeable in the lower panel of Figure 4 where the average
FWHM of the pulses for the 3D models are shown. For
the three-dimensional T =4 s model for example, the
average FWHM of the pulses obtained at robs is 0.660s
(and an average of the quiescent epoch equal to 3.340s).
The T =2 s model has an average FWHM value for the
pulses equal to 0.209s (and and average FWHM for the
quiescent epochs equal to 1.791s), 0.082s (and 0.918s)
for the one second period model, and 0.08s (and 0.12s)
for the 0.2s period model. This diﬀerence is due to the
fact that the stellar material can re-ﬁll the jet path in
between pulses if the engine is turned oﬀ for a long time.
As Figure 3 shows, the inter-pulse space is ﬁlled by slow,
dense material, and the jet material needs to work its
way against it. Only for the faster engine the eﬀect is
not seen (see bottom panel of Figure 4).

3.3. Two-dimensional models

The ﬁnal intention of this study is to compare the re-
sults from the numerical simulations with real data from
GRB observations. To do so, we require to construct a
large synthetic dataset from the numerical models with
comparable amount of pulses and quiescent periods as
the observations. Unfortunately, constructing such syn-

ror bars) of the 3D and the 2D episodic models (black solid line
with black circles and red dashed line with red triangles, respec-
tively). The pulses average Lorentz factor of the 3D HR model is
also included (blue cross). Middle panel: Pulses maximum poten-
tially achievable Lorentz factor (±1σ error bars) of the 3D episodic
models. Bottom panel: Pulses average FWHM (±1σ error bars)
of the 3D and 2D episodic models. (A color version of this ﬁgure
is available in the online journal.)

Figure 4 we plot the pulses maximum potentially achiev-
able Lorentz factor Γ∞ (Γ∞ = Γ[1 + p/(ρ c2)]). Pulses
from the long period engines reach their maximum poten-
tial acceleration (Γ∞ = 400), while pulses from central
engines with faster variability do not. The latter is due
to baryon loading as the jet drills through the progeni-
tor. Faster variability increases the baryon load loading
and thus the Γ∞ for the shortest variability period is
signiﬁcantly reduced (Γ∞ ∼ 100). Finally, there is a cor-
relation between the average full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of the pulses of the 3D episodic models and
the correspondent period (FWHM∝ T ), as shown in the
bottom panel of Figure 4, this will be further discussed
in Section 3.2.

3.2. Resolution eﬀects and light curves

To check for resolution eﬀects and to assess the relia-
bility of our results, we performed an extra three dimen-
sional 0.2 s period model with a broader high-resolution
region (m3D0.2hr). The HR model had the same input
and boundary conditions as the LR model but contrary
to the LR model the cocoon in the HR was solved entirely
with its ﬁnest grid level (4∆). The tbo for the HR model
(tbo=11.20s) is practically the same as that from the LR
model (less than 2% diﬀerence, see Table 1). In Figure 5,
we show the comparison of the density map (with Γ con-
tours) between the HR and LR for the T =0.2s model
once both models have broken out of the star. Akin to
L´opez-C´amara et al.
(2013) the HR model not only
presents more turbulence but also evolves slightly slower
(∼1% slower) because of a larger amount of turbulence
within the cocoon enhanced by the ﬁner resolution. Due
to numerical limitations the HR was only followed up to
12.8 seconds. By this time, the HR model has a higher
Γ value at the base of the jet (Γ=30) and lower value
at the head of the jet (Γ=2) compared to the LR case
(Γ=10 and 5, respectively).

thetic dataset form the 3D simulations is out of the com-
putational possibilities. Thus, we are left with using less
expensive 2D episodic models. First though, we need to
check whether the 2D models reproduce the main mor-
phology of the 3D variable jet models, and then build the
large synthetic dataset from these fast models to ﬁnally
compare the results with the observations.

In order to validate whether or not the 2D simulations
reproduce the same morphological behavior as the 3D
models we ran a ﬁrst set of 2D simulations (four in total)
with the same resolution, numerical domain, boundary
conditions, periods as the 3D LR models, and were car-
ried out in cylindrical coordinates. The ﬁrst important
point to mention concerning the 2D variable jet models is
that they all managed to break out of the stellar progen-
itor. The break out times for the T =0.2s, 1s, 2s and 4s
two-dimensional models were 5.60s, 10.07s, 11.93s, and
12.34s (respectively). These tbo are once more consis-
tent with previous two- and three- dimensional GRB jet
studies (already mentioned before), as well as the ana-
lytic solution of Bromberg et al.
(2011). However, the
results from these runs display a correlation between en-
gine variability and break-out time that is opposite to
the one found in 3D.

The origin of such a strikingly opposite behavior be-
tween the variability of the engine and its correspondent
tbo for 2D and 3D is not entirely clear, but is most likely
related to the enhanced turbulence seen in 3D simula-
tions versus 2D ones (for further details see Figure 7).
For a continuous engine, the 3D simulation is faster due
to the possibility of the jet head to skirt around the high-
density area in front of the jet itself (Zhang et al. 2004;
L´opez-C´amara et al.
2013). For an unsteady engine,
instead, propagation in 3D is more diﬃcult due to the
increased amount of turbulence excited by the unsteady
engine. In any of the cases, the diﬀerence seems to be re-
lated to the propagation of the head of the jet only. Once
the channel has been drilled, 2D and 3D simulations be-
have remarkably similarly. As for the 3D models the
episodic 2D models show a correlation between the aver-
age Γ value and T : Γ=7.77Hz×T +5.84 (with R2=0.98)
and between the average FWHM of the pulses and T

(see upper panel of Figure 4). Even though the slope of
2D correlation between Γ and T is smaller than its re-
spective 3D case, it falls within the 1σ error bars of the
3D values. The average FWHM of the pulses from 2D
episodic models also falls within the 1σ error bars of the
3D values (see the lower panel of Figure 4). The latter is
also visible in the lower panel of Figure 6 where the LPCs
of the 2D models are shown. The details of the average
FWHM of the pulses and its correspondent σ error bars
for both the 3D and 2D variable jet models are shown in
Table 2.
Finally, we analyzed the Schlieren maps (∇(log10(ρ))
for both the 3D and 2D models in order to trace how
the turbulence and shocks diﬀers between the 2D and
3D cases. Figure 7 shows the comparison between the
Schlieren maps. Each panel shows the 3D XY plane on
the left hand side while the right hand side shows the
2D case. From left to right, the three panels show the
T =4s, 1.0s and 0.2s models. We must note that the
timeframes for all models were handpicked so that the
cocoon has expanded up to robs. The 2D episodic mod-
els show larger bow shocks and less turbulence within
the cocoon compared to the 3D cases. Never the less,
as the variable 2D jet drills through the progenitor the
turbulence and bow shocks from the ≈lower half of the
jet resembles very much that from its respective 3D case
(see the regions within the cyan dashed lines in Figure 7).
Adding then the similarity between the break out times,
the correlation between average Γ and T , the correlation
between the average FWHM and T , and the resemblance
of the Schlieren maps within a small angle θobs between
the 3D and 2D models, we conclude that the 2D models
do reproduce the large scale morphology of the 3D mod-
els. Thus, we build the extensive synthetic dataset from
a large number of 2D simulations and compare it with
the observations. We also notice how in both 2D and 3D
models a bow shock is present ahead of each pulse, con-
ﬁrming that each jet pulse is working against the stellar
material, not only the ﬁrst pulse at the head of the jet.

3.4. Synthetic data set and comparison with the

observations

NP02 analyzed the temporal behavior of 68 long GRBs.
The total of the pulses and quiescent times in these bright
bursts was in total: 1330 pulses and 1262 quiescent in-
tervals. Their main result was the detection of an asym-
metry between the distribution of the pulse durations
and the distribution of the duration of the quiescent
periods. Our 2D and 3D simulation results show that
pulse duration from periodic engines is systematically de-

creased, and the quiescent period duration consequently
increased. Such pulse shortening (and quiescence dura-
tion increase) is due to the fact that the quiescent regions
are reﬁlled by stellar material (specially in long quiescent
epochs where there the stellar material has more time to
reﬁll the funnel before the subsequent pulse crafts the
funnel again). This point is backed by the presence of
clear bow shocks in the Schlieren maps of the intermit-
tent jets (shown in Figure 7) and could thus be the mech-
anism at the base of the asymmetry detected by NP02.
In order to quantify the eﬀect on a more realistic dataset
of LPCs, we constructed a large synthetic dataset with
comparable amount of GRB pulses and quiescent peri-
ods (with non-periodic engines). For this, we ran twenty
2D variable jet simulations, each one with random pulse
and quiescent epoch durations (all with the same reso-
lution and boundary conditions as the 2D models dis-
cussed in Section 3.3 (see Table 1 for further details).
In each model the injected pulses and quiescent periods
varied between 0s and 4s, resulting in at least ﬁve pulses
and ﬁve quiescent times in each 2D random variable jet
model. In total we injected 240 pulses and 246 quiescent
epochs in the 20 simulations performed.

The normalized histogram of the measured duration
distribution of both the pulses and quiescent epochs
is shown in Figure 8. As for the 3D and 2D models
with equal active and quiescent durations, the synthetic
dataset obtained from the 2D models with random pulse
and quiescent durations also shows a decrease (and in-
crease) in the pulses (and quiescent) distributions ob-
tained at robs. Figure 8 shows a clear asymmetry in the
obtained distributions, with the quiescent interval du-
rations extending to much longer times than the pulses.
This replicates the NP02 result. However, it was not pos-
sible for us to completely reproduce their analysis, since
their deﬁnition of pulse duration was based on the back-
ground level and our LPCs do not have background. We

therefore computed the pulse duration as its FWHM and
the quiescent period duration as the time during which
the emission was less than 10% of the peak of the preced-
ing pulse. NP02, instead, computed the pulse duration
as the interval between two points (on each side of the
peak) that are higher than the background by 1/4 of the
peaks height or by the minimum between two neighbor-
ing peaks (if the latter is higher), and the duration of
quiescent intervals as the length of time during which no
detectable ﬂux is present. Due to the diﬀerent method-
ology (in how the pulses and quiescent epochs are com-
puted) between NP02 and this study, a more quantitative
comparison is not possible.

NP02, in their dataset, also found a positive correla-
tion between the duration of the quiescent periods and
the subsequent pulse. We thus searched for a possible
correlation between the quiescent intervals and the fol-
lowing pulse in our synthetic dataset. Figure 9 shows

variability and the time the jet takes to break oﬀ the
stellar surface. We show how both the average Lorentz
factor of the pulses and the correspondent Lorentz factor
at complete acceleration are aﬀected by the engine vari-
ability. The faster the engine variability the more loaded
with baryon is the jet. Still, a more detailed treatment of
the jet injection is required to better understand how the
baryon loading aﬀects the light curve. A model in which
the engine luminosity is fairly constant but some other
property varies (e.g., magnetization or velocity strati-
ﬁcation) would provide a more successful outcome by
keeping the funnel open while creating variability as a
result of more eﬃcient dissipation. We also found that
the propagation through the stellar progenitor has the ef-
fect of shortening the pulse durations and expanding the
quiescent times, especially for engines with long variabil-
ity period. This behavior seems to be due to the fact
that the jet channel reﬁlls with stellar material if the
engine is turned oﬀ for too long a time (more than a
fraction of a second). A comparison of pulse properties
with bright BATSE GRBs (NP02), however, is not en-
tirely successful since our synthetic light curves do not
reproduce the correlation between the duration of pulses
and of the quiescent time preceding the pulses. Such cor-
relation is probably due to the central engine itself and
not a consequence of the propagation of the jet through
the progenitor star.

a scatter plot of the preceding quiescent interval dura-
tion versus the pulse duration. We ﬁnd no statistically
signiﬁcant trend. Such lack of correlation between the
quiescent periods and pulses could be due to the bow
shocks and the reduced amount of turbulence that are
present in the 2D models.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We presented a set of 2D and 3D numerical simulations
of the propagation of relativistic GRB jets in progenitor
stars and beyond. These new simulations conﬁrm the
previous 2D results that episodic jets manage to drill
and break out of the progenitor and that the active pe-
riods are low-density and high-Gamma (contrary to the
quiescent periods which have higher densities and lower
Lorentz values).

We ﬁnd that there are correlations between the period
of the engine variability and the average Lorentz factor
of the pulses and also between the period of the engine
