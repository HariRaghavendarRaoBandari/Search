Dmitrii Silvestrov1 and Sergei Silvestrov2

Abstract: New algorithms for construction of asymptotic expansions for
stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with
ﬁnite phase spaces are presented. These algorithms are based on a special
technique of sequential phase space reduction, which can be applied to pro-
cesses with an arbitrary asymptotic communicative structure of phase spaces.
Asymptotic expansions are given in two forms, without and with explicit
bounds for remainders.

Keywords: Markov chain; semi-Markov process; nonlinear perturbation;
stationary distribution; expected hitting time; Laurent asymptotic expansion

1. Introduction

In this paper, we present new algorithms for construction of asymptotic
expansions for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes with a ﬁnite phase space.

This is Part I of the paper, where algorithms for constructing of asymp-
totic expansions with remainders of a standard form o(·) are given. In Part
II, we present algorithms for construction asymptotic expansions of a more
advanced form, with explicit upper bounds for remainders.

We consider models, where the phase space is one class of communicative
states, for embedded Markov chains of pre-limiting perturbed semi-Markov

processes, while it can possess an arbitrary communicative structure, i.e., can
consist of one or several closed classes of communicative states and, possibly,
a class of transient states, for the limiting embedded Markov chain.

The initial perturbation conditions are formulated in the forms of Taylor
and Laurent asymptotic expansions, respectively, for transition probabili-
ties (of embedded Markov chains) and expectations of sojourn times, for
perturbed semi-Markov processes. Two variants of these expansions are con-
sidered, with remainders given without and with explicit upper bounds.

The algorithms are based on special time-space screening procedures for
sequential phase space reduction and algorithms for re-calculation of asymp-
totic expansions and upper bounds for remainders, which constitute pertur-
bation conditions for the semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces.
The ﬁnal asymptotic expansions for stationary distributions of nonlin-
early perturbed semi-Markov processes are given in the form of Taylor asymp-
totic expansions with remainders given, as was mentioned above, in two vari-
ants, without (in Part I) and with explicit upper bounds (in Part II).

Models of perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes, in partic-
ular, for the most diﬃcult cases of perturbed processes with absorption and
so-called singularly perturbed processes, attracted attention of researchers in
the mid of the 20th century.

An interest to these models has been stimulated by applications to control
and queuing systems, information networks, epidemic models and models of
mathematical genetics and population dynamics. As a rule, Markov-type
processes with singular perturbations appear as natural tools for mathemati-
cal analysis of multi-component systems with weakly interacting components.
The ﬁrst works related to asymptotical problems for the above models
are, Meshalkin (1958), Simon and Ando (1961), Hanen (1963), Seneta (1967),
Schweitzer (1968), and Korolyuk (1969).

The methods used for construction of asymptotic expansions for station-
ary distributions and related functionals such as moments of hitting times
can be split in three groups.

The most widely used methods are based on analysis of generalized re-
solvent type inverses for transition matrices and operators for singularly
perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes. Mainly, models with
linear, polynomial and analytical perturbations have been objects of stud-
ies. We refer here to works by Schweitzer (1968), Turbin (1972), Poliˇsˇcuk
and Turbin (1973), Koroljuk, Brodi and Turbin (1974), Pervozvanski˘ı and
Smirnov (1974), Courtois and Louchard (1976), Korolyuk and Turbin (1976,

and Javid (1980), Seneta (1981, 2006), Delebecque (1983), Kartashov (1985,
1996), Haviv (1986), Stewart and Sun (1990), Silvestrov and Abadov (1991,
1993), Haviv, Ritov and Rothblum (1992), Schweitzer and Stewart (1993),
Stewart (1998, 2001), Yin and Zhang (1998, 2003, 2005, 2013), Avrachenkov

rolyuk, V.V. (1999), Avrachenkov and Haviv (2003, 2004), Craven (2003),
Bini, Latouche and Meini (2005), Korolyuk and Limnios (2005), and Avra-
chenkov, Filar and Howlett (2013).

Aggregation/disaggregation methods based on various modiﬁcations of
Gauss elimination method and space screening procedures for perturbed
Markov chains have been employed for approximation of stationary distribu-
tions for Markov chains in works by Coderch, Willsky, Sastry and Casta˜non
(1983), Delebecque (1983), Ga˘ıtsgori and Pervozvanski˘ı (1983), Chatelin and
Miranker (1984), Courtois and Semal (1984), Seneta (1984, 1991), Cao and
Stewart (1985), Vantilborgh (1985), Feinberg and Chiu (1987), Haviv (1987,
1992, 1999), Rohlichek (1987), Rohlicek and Willsky (1988), Sumita and
Reiders (1988), Meyer (1989), Schweitzer (1991), Stewart and Zhang (1991),
Stewart (1993, 1998, 2001), Kim and Smith (1995), Marek and Pultarov´a
(2006), Marek, Mayer and Pultarov´a (2009), and Avrachenkov, Filar and
Howlett (2013).

Alternatively, methods based on regenerative properties of Markov chains
and semi-Markov processes,
in particular, relations which link stationary
probabilities and expectations of return times, have been used for getting
approximations for expectations of hitting times and stationary distributions
in works by Grassman, Taksar and Heyman (1985), Hassin and Haviv (1992)
and Hunter (2005). Also, the above mentioned relations and methods, based
on asymptotic expansions for nonlinearly perturbed regenerative processes
developed in works by Silvestrov (1995, 2010, 2014), Englund and Silvestrov
(1997), Gyllenberg and Silvestrov (1999, 2000, 2008), Englund (2001), Ni,
Silvestrov and Malyarenko (2008), Ni (2011, 2014), Petersson (2013, 2014),
and Silvestrov and Petersson (2013), have been used for getting asymptotic
expansions for stationary and quasi-stationary distributions for nonlinearly
perturbed Markov chains and semi-Markov processes with absorption.

A more comprehensive bibliography of works in the area can be found in
the research report by Silvestrov, D. and Silvestrov, S. (2015), which is an
extended preliminary version of the present paper.

In the present paper, we combine methods based on the stochastic aggre-

3

gation/disaggregation approach with the methods based on asymptotic ex-
pansions for perturbed regenerative processes applied to perturbed semi-
Markov processes.

In the above mentioned works based on the stochastic aggregation/dis-
aggregation approach, space screening procedures for discrete time Markov
chains are used. In this case, a Markov chain with reduced phase space is
constructed from the initial one as the sequence of its states at sequential
moment of hitting into the reduced phase space. Times between sequential
hitting of the reduced phase space are not taken into account. Such screening
procedure preserves ratios of hitting frequencies for states from the reduced
phase space and, thus, ratios of stationary probabilities are the same for
the initial and the reduced Markov chains. This implies that the stationary
probabilities for the reduced Markov chain coincide with the corresponding
stationary probabilities for the initial Markov chain up to the change of the
corresponding normalizing factor.

We use another more complex type of time-space screening procedures,
for semi-Markov processes. In this case, a semi-Markov process with reduced
phase space is constructed from the initial one as the sequence of its states
at sequential moment of hitting into the reduced phase space, and times
between sequential jumps of the reduced semi-Markov process are times be-
tween sequential hitting of the reduced space by the initial semi-Markov
process. Such screening procedure preserves hitting times for states from the
reduced phase space, i.e., these times and, thus, their expectations are the
same for the initial and the reduced semi-Markov processes.

We formulate perturbation conditions in terms of asymptotic expansions
for transition characteristics of perturbed semi-Markov processes. The re-
mainders in these expansions and, thus, the transition characteristics of per-
turbed semi-Markov processes can be non-analytical functions of perturba-
tion parameter. This makes a diﬀerence with the results for models with
linear, polynomial and analytical perturbations.

The methods of asymptotic analysis for nonlinearly perturbed regener-
ative processes developed in works by Silvestrov (1995, 2010) and Gyllen-
berg and Silvestrov (1999, 2000, 2008) are employed. However, we use the
technique of more general Laurent asymptotic expansions, instead of Tay-
lor asymptotic expansions used in the above mentioned works, and combine
these methods with the aggregation/disaggregation approach, instead of the
approach based on generalized matrix inverses. This let us consider per-
turbed semi-Markov processes with an arbitrary asymptotic communicative

4

structure of the phase space.

An important novelty of our studies also is that we consider asymptotic
expansions with remainders given not only in a standard form of o(·), but,
also, in a more advanced form, with explicit power-type upper bounds for
remainders, uniform with respect to a perturbation parameter.

Semi-Markov processes are a natural generalization of Markov chains, im-
portant theoretically and essentially extending applications of Markov-type
models. The asymptotic results obtained in the paper are a good illustration
for this statement. In particular, they automatically yield analogous asymp-
totic results for nonlinearly perturbed discrete and continuous time Markov
chains.

We also show how algorithms based on sequential phase space reduction
can be used for getting Laurent asymptotic expansions for expected hitting
times, for nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes. In the context of
the present paper, such expansions play an intermediate role. At the same
time, they, obviously, have their own theoretical and applied values.

The method proposed in the paper can be interpreted as a stochastic
analogue of the Gauss elimination method. It is based on the procedure of
sequential exclusion of states from the phase space of perturbed semi-Markov
processes accompanied by re-calculation of asymptotic expansions penetrat-
ing perturbation conditions for semi-Markov processes with reduced phase
spaces. The corresponding algorithms are based on some kind of “opera-
tional calculus” for Laurent asymptotic expansions with remainders given
in two forms, without and with explicit upper bounds. These algorithms
have an universal character. They can be applied to nonlinearly perturbed
semi-Markov processes with an arbitrary asymptotic communicative struc-
ture of the phase space. The algorithms are computationally eﬀective, due
to a recurrent character of the corresponding computational procedures.

Part I of the paper includes seven sections.

In Section 2, we present
operational rules for Laurent asymptotic expansions. In Section 3, we for-
mulate basic perturbation conditions for Markov chains and semi-Markov
processes. In Section 4, we give some basic formulas for stationary distri-
butions for semi-Markov processes, in particular, formulas connecting sta-
tionary distributions with expectations of return times.
In Section 5, we
present an one-step time-space screening procedure of phase space reduction
for perturbed semi-Markov processes. In Section 6, we present algorithms
for re-calculation of asymptotic expansions for transition characteristics of
nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces. In

5

Section 7, we present an algorithm for sequential reduction of phase space for
semi-Markov processes and construction of Laurent asymptotic expansions
for expected return times. In Section 8, we present the main result in Part
I of the paper that is a new algorithm for construction of asymptotic ex-
pansions for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes.

2. Laurent asymptotic expansions

In this section, we present so-called operational rules for Laurent asymp-
totic expansions. The corresponding proofs and comments are given in Ap-
pendix A, in Part II of the paper.

Let A(ε) be a real-valued function deﬁned on an interval (0, ε0], for some

0 < ε0 ≤ 1, and given on this interval by a Laurent asymptotic expansion,

A(ε) = ahAεhA + · · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA),

where (a) −∞ < hA ≤ kA < ∞ are integers, (b) coeﬃcients ahA, . . . , akA

It is also useful to mention that a constant a can be interpreted as function
A(ε) ≡ a. Thus, 0 can be represented, for any integer −∞ < h ≤ k < ∞,
as the (h, k)-expansion, 0 = 0εh + . . . + 0εk + o(εk), with remainder o(εk) ≡
0. Also, 1 can be represented, for any integer 0 ≤ k < ∞, as the (0, k)-
expansion, 1 = 1 + 0ε + . . . + 0εk + o(εk), with remainder o(εk) ≡ 0.

Let us consider four Laurent asymptotic expansions, A(ε) = ahAεhA +
· · · + akAεkA + oA(εkA), B(ε) = bhB εhB + · · · + bkB εkB + oB(εkB), C(ε) =
chC εhC + · · · + ckC εkC + oC(εkC ), and D(ε) = dhDεhD + · · · + dkD εkD + oD(εkD)
deﬁned for 0 < ε ≤ ε0, for some 0 < ε0 ≤ 1.

The following lemma presents operational rules for Laurent asymptotic

expansions.

Lemma 2. The following operational rules take place for Laurent asymp-

totic expansions:

(i) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion and c is a constant, then

C(ε) = cA(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC)-expansion such that:

(a) hC = hA, kC = kA;
(b) chC +r = cahC +r, r = 0, . . . , kC − hC;
(c) oC(εkC ) = coA(εkA).
This expansion is pivotal if and only if chC = cahA 6= 0.
(ii) If A(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hA, kA)-expansion and B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is
a (hB, kB)-expansion, then C(ε) = A(ε) + B(ε), ε ∈ (0, ε0] is a (hC, kC)-
expansion such that:

(a) hC = hA ∧ hB, kC = kA ∧ kB;
(b) chC +r = ahC +r + bhC +r, r = 0, . . . , kC − hC, where ahC +r = 0 for

0 ≤ r < hA − hC and bhC +r = 0 for 0 ≤ r < hB − hC;

Remark 1. By Lemma 1, the Laurent asymptotic expansions for function
D(ε), given by the alternative formulas (a) – (c) and (d) – (f) in proposi-
tion (v) of Lemma 2, coincide. Also, these Laurent asymptotic expansions
coincide with the expansions given by formulas (a) – (c) in propositions
(iv) of Lemma 2, if A(ε) ≡ 1. In this case, 1 should be interpreted as the
(0, kB −hB)-expansion, 1 = 1+0ε+. . .+0εkB−hB +o(εkB−hB ), with remainder
o(εkB−hB) ≡ 0.

of Laurent asymptotic expansions, used in what follows, are direct corollaries
of the corresponding summation and multiplication rules given in Lemma 2.

The following lemma summarizes some basic algebraic properties of Lau-

rent asymptotic expansions. It is a corollary of Lemmas 1 and 2.

Lemma 4. The summation and multiplication operations for Laurent
asymptotic expansions deﬁned in Lemma 2 possess the following algebraic
properties, which should be understood as identities for the corresponding
Laurent asymptotic expansions (i.e., identities for the corresponding param-
eters h, k, coeﬃcients and remainders) of functions represented in two alter-
native forms in the functional identities given below:

(i) The summation and multiplication operations for Laurent asymptotic
expansions satisfy the “elimination” identities that are implied by the cor-
responding functional identities, A(ε) + 0 ≡ A(ε), A(ε) · 1 ≡ A(ε),
A(ε) − A(ε) ≡ 0 and A(ε) · A(ε)−1 ≡ 1.

(ii) The summation operation for Laurent asymptotic expansions is com-
mutative and associative that is implied by the corresponding functional iden-
tities, A(ε) + B(ε) ≡ B(ε) + A(ε) and (A(ε) + B(ε)) + C(ε) ≡ A(ε) + (B(ε) +
C(ε)).

(iii) The multiplication operation for Laurent asymptotic expansions is
commutative and associative that is implied by the corresponding functional
identities, A(ε) · B(ε) ≡ B(ε) · A(ε) and (A(ε) · B(ε)) · C(ε) ≡ A(ε) · (B(ε) ·

C(ε)).

(iv) The summation and multiplication operations for Laurent asymptotic
expansions possess distributive property that is implied by the corresponding
functional identity, (A(ε) + B(ε)) · C(ε) ≡ A(ε) · C(ε) + B(ε) · C(ε).

Remark 2. In proposition (i) of Lemma 4, 0 should be interpreted as the
(hA, kA)-expansion, 0 = 0+0εhA+. . .+0εkA +o(εkA), with remainder o(εkA) ≡
0, and 1 as (0, kA − hA)-expansion, 1 = 1 + 0ε + . . . + 0εkA−hA + o(εkA−hA),
with remainder o(εkA−hA) ≡ 0.

Remark 3. The Laurent asymptotic expansion A(ε) is assumed to be
in the elimination identity implied by functional identity A(ε) ·

3. Nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov processes

Let X = {1, . . . , N} and (η(ε)

n ), n = 0, 1, . . . be, for every ε ∈ (0, 1],
a Markov renewal process, i.e., a homogeneous Markov chain with the phase
space X × [0, ∞), an initial distribution ¯p(ε) = hp(ε)
0 = 0} =
P{η(ε)

i = P{η(ε)

0 = i, κ(ε)

n , κ(ε)

0 = i}, i ∈ Xi and transition probabilities,
ij (t) = P{η(ε)

1 = j, κ(ε)

1 ≤ t/η(ε)

0 = i, κ(ε)

Q(ε)

0 = s}, (i, s), (j, t) ∈ X × [0, ∞).

In this case, the random sequence η(ε)

(2)
n is also a homogeneous (embedded)

Markov chain with the phase space X and the transition probabilities,

pij(ε) = P{η(ε)

1 = j/η(ε)

0 = i} = Q(ε)

ij (∞), i, j ∈ X.

(3)

The following condition plays an important role in what follows:

A: There exist sets Yi ⊆ X, i ∈ X and ε0 ∈ (0, 1] such that: (a) prob-
abilities pij(ε) > 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0]; (b) probabilities
pij(ε) = 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0];
(c) there exists, for ev-
ery pair of states i, j ∈ X, an integer nij ≥ 1 and a chain of states
i = lij,0, lij,1, . . . , lij,nij = j such that lij,1 ∈ Ylij,0, . . . , lij,nij ∈ Ylij,nij −1.

We refer to sets Yi, i ∈ X as transition sets. Conditions A implies that

all sets Yi 6= ∅, i ∈ X.

Condition A also implies that the phase space X of Markov chain η(ε)

n

is

one class of communicative states, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

We also assume that the following condition excluding instant transitions

holds:

10

B: Q(ε)

ij (0) = 0, i, j ∈ X, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

Let us now introduce a semi-Markov process,

η(ε)(t) = η(ε)

ν(ε)(t), t ≥ 0,

(4)

where ν(ε)(t) = max(n ≥ 0 : ζ (ε)
interval [0, t], for t ≥ 0, and ζ (ε)
moments of jumps, for the semi-Markov process η(ε)(t).

n ≤ t) is a number of jumps in the time
n , n = 0, 1, . . ., are sequential

1 +· · ·+κ(ε)

n = κ(ε)

If Q(ε)

ij (t) = I(t ≥ 1)pij(ε), t ≥ 0, i, j ∈ X, then η(ε)(t) = η(ε)

[t] , t ≥ 0 is a

discrete time homogeneous Markov chain embedded in continuous time.

If Q(ε)

ij (t) = (1−e−λi(ε)t)pij(ε), t ≥ 0, i, j ∈ X (here, 0 < λi(ε) < ∞, i ∈ X),

then η(ε)(t), t ≥ 0 is a continuous time homogeneous Markov chain.

Let us also introduce expectations of sojourn times,

eij(ε) = Eiκ(ε)

1 I(η(ε)

1 = j) = Z ∞

0

tQ(ε)

ij (dt), i, j ∈ X.

(5)

Here and henceforth, notations Pi and Ei are used for conditional proba-

bilities and expectations under condition η(ε)(0) = i.

We also assume that the following condition holds:

C: eij(ε) < ∞, i, j ∈ X, for ε ∈ (0, ε0].

In the case of discrete time Markov chain, eij(ε) = pij(ε), i, j ∈ X.
In the case of continuous time Markov chain, eij(ε) = λi(ε)−1pij(ε), i, j ∈

X.

Conditions A (a) – (b) and B imply that, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0], expecta-

tions eij(ε) > 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, and eij(ε) = 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X.

Let us assume that the following perturbation condition, based on Taylor

asymptotic expansions, holds:

We also assume that the following perturbation condition, based on Lau-

ij ≤ m+
ij < ∞, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X; (b)

ij → 0 as ε → 0, for j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X.

Conditions A, D and E, assumed to hold for some ε0 ∈ (0, 1], also hold

for any ε′

0 ∈ (0, ε0].

It worth to note that an actual value of parameter ε0 ∈ (0, 1] is not
important in propositions concerned asymptotic expansions with remainders
given in form of o(·).

Let us, for the moment, exclude sub-condition (a) from condition A.
Conditions D and E imply that there exits ˜ε0 ∈ (0, ε0] such that pij(ε) =

j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, ε ∈ (0, ˜ε0]. We can, just, decrease parameter ε0 and to take
the new ε0 = ˜ε0. Condition A (a) holds for this new value of ε0.

We, however, do prefer to include sub-condition (a) in condition A, in
order to have a clear description for the communicative structure of the phase
space X, in one condition. In this case, the above inequalities hold for ˜ε0 = ε0.
Conditions D and E are consistent with condition A (a), according the

above remarks.

Matrix kpij(ε)k is stochastic, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0]. This model stochastic-

ity assumption holds by the default.

Condition D should, also, be consistent with this model stochasticity

assumption.

Condition D and proposition (i) (the multiple summation rule) of Lemma

3 imply that sum Pj∈Y pij(ε) can, for every subset Y ⊆ Yi and i ∈ X, be

represented in the form of the following Laurent asymptotic expansion,

pij(ε) =

Let us introduce the following condition, which presents additional links
between the asymptotic expansions penetrating condition D, which are caused
by the above model stochasticity assumption:

12

F: (a) ai,Yi[l] = Pj∈Yi

aij[l] = 0, for 0 ≤ l < l−

Lemma 5. Let conditions A (a) – (b) and D hold. In this case, condi-
tion F is equivalent to the model stochasticity assumption that matrix kpij(ε)k
is stochastic, for every ε ∈ (0, ε0].

Proof. The model stochasticity assumption for matrices kpij(ε)k, ε ∈
(0, ε0], takes, under conditions A (a) – (b), the form of the following identity,
which should hold for every i ∈ X,

pij(ε) = 1, ε ∈ (0, ε0].

(7)

Xj∈Yi

Condition D let us apply Lemma 1 to the identity given in relation (7),
for every i ∈ X. The asymptotic expansion given in relation (6), for the
case Y = Yi, and the (0, k)-expansion, 1 = 1 + 0ε + · · · + 0εk + o(εk), with
remainder o(εk) ≡ 0 and k = l+
, should be used. This proves that identities
i,Yi
given in relation (7) imply holding of condition F. The opposite implication
of identities given in relation (7) by condition F is obvious. (cid:3)

Additional comments concerned the link between perturbation condition
D and the model stochasticity assumption for matrices kpij(ε)k, ε ∈ (0, ε0]
are given in Appendix B, in Part II of the paper.

It is also worse to note that, under the assumption of holding condition

A (a), the perturbation conditions D and E are independent.

To see this, let us take arbitrary positive functions pij(ε), j ∈ Xi, i ∈
X and eij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X satisfying, respectively, conditions D and E,
and, also, the corresponding stochasticity identities (7). Then, there exist
semi-Markov transition probabilities Q(ε)
ij (t), t ≥ 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X such that
ij (∞) = pij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X and R ∞
Q(ε)
t Q(ε)
ij (dt) = eij(ε), j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X, for
every ε ∈ (0, ε0]. It is readily seen that, for example, semi-Markov transition
probabilities Q(ε)
ij (t) = I(t ≥ eij(ε)/pij(ε))pij(ε), t ≥ 0, j ∈ Yi, i ∈ X satisfy
the above relations.

4. Semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces

Let us choose some state r ∈ X and consider the reduced phase space

rX = X \ {r}, with the state r excluded from the phase space X.

13

Let us assume that the initial distributions satisfy the following assump-

tion,

r = P{η(ε)
p(ε)

0 = r} = 0, ε ∈ (0, ε0].

(8)

Let us deﬁne the sequential moments of hitting the reduced space rX by

the embedded Markov chain η(ε)
n ,

rξ(ε)

n = min(k > rξ(ε)

n−1, η(ε)

k ∈ rX), n = 1, 2, . . . , rξ(ε)

Now, let us deﬁne the random sequence,

This sequence is also a Markov renewal process with a phase space rX ×
[0, ∞), the initial distribution r ¯p(ε) = hrp(ε)

p(ε)
r = 0), and transition probabilities deﬁned for (i, s), (j, t) ∈ rX × [0, ∞),

(11)

Respectively, one can deﬁne the transformed semi-Markov process with

the reduced phase space rX,

rη(ε)(t) = rη(ε)

r ν(ε)(t), t ≥ 0,

(12)

where rν(ε)(t) = max(n ≥ 0 : rζ (ε)
[0, t], for t ≥ 0, and rζ (ε)
n = rκ(ε)
moments of jumps, for the semi-Markov process rη(ε)(t).

n ≤ t) is a number of jumps at time interval

The transition probabilities rQ(ε)

(0, ε0].

Let us introduce sets, Y−

ir = {j ∈ rX : j ∈ Yr} if r ∈ Yi, or ∅ if r /∈ Yi,

and Y+

ir = {j ∈ rX : j ∈ Yi}, for i, r ∈ X.

We omit the proof of the following simple lemma.

15

The following theorem plays the key role in what follows.
Theorem 1. Let conditions A – C hold for semi-Markov processes
η(ε)(t). Then, for any state j ∈ rX, the ﬁrst hitting times τ (ε)
and rτ (ε)
to the state j, respectively, for semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t) and rη(ε)(t), co-
incide, and, thus, the expectations of hitting times Eij(ε) = Eiτ (ε)

5. Asymptotic expansions for transition characteristics of per-

turbed semi-Markov processes with reduced phase spaces

As was mentioned above, condition A implies that sets Y+

rr 6= ∅, r ∈ X
and the non-absorption probability ¯prr(ε) = 1 − prr(ε) > 0, for r ∈ X, ε ∈
(0, ε0]. This probability satisﬁes the following relation, for every r ∈ X and
ε ∈ (0, ε0],

¯prr(ε) = 1 − prr(ε) = Xj∈Y+

prj(ε).

(20)

Lemma 8. Let conditions A and D hold. Then, the pivotal (¯l−

rr)-
expansions for the non-absorption probabilities ¯prr(ε), r ∈ X are given by the
algorithm described below, in the proof of the lemma.

rr, ¯l+

Proof. Let r ∈ Yr. First, proposition (i) (the multiple summation rule)
prj(ε). Second, proposi-
tions (i) (the multiplication by constant −1) and (ii) (the summation with

constant 1) of Lemma 2 should be applied to the asymptotic expansion for
probability prr(ε) given in condition B, in order to get the asymptotic ex-
pansion for function 1 − prr(ε). Third, Lemma 1 should be applied to the
asymptotic expansion for function ¯prr(ε) given in two alternative forms by
relation (20). Note that condition F holds also for the above case, where the
asymptotic expansion for probability ¯prr(ε), obtained at the second step, is
replaced by the improved version of this expansion, obtained with the use
of Lemma 1 at the third step. The case r /∈ Yr is trivial, since, in this
case, probability ¯prr(ε) ≡ 1. According to Lemmas 1 – 3, (¯l−

Theorem 2. Conditions A and D, assumed to hold for the Markov
chains η(ε)
n , with the same
parameter ε0 and the transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX, given by relation (15). The
pivotal (rl−
ij)-expansions penetrating condition D are given for transition
probabilities rpij(ε), j ∈ rYi, i ∈ rX, r ∈ X by the algorithm described below,
in the proof of the theorem.

ij, rl+

Proof. Lemma 6 implies that condition A holds for the Markov chains
n , with the same parameter ε0 as for the Markov chains η(ε)
n , and the

rη(ε)
transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX given by relation (15).

Let us prove that condition D also holds for the Markov chains rη(ε)

n , with
the same parameter ε0 and the transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX given by relation
(15).
In order to do this, let us construct the corresponding asymptotic
expansions penetrating this condition. Let j, r ∈ Yi ∩ Yr. First, proposition
prj(ε)
(v) (the division rule) of Lemma 2 should be applied to the quotient
1−prr(ε) .
Second, proposition (iii) (the multiplication rule) of Lemma 2 should be
applied to the product pir(ε)· prj(ε)
1−prr(ε) . Third, proposition (ii) (the summation
prj(ε)
rule) of Lemma 2 should be applied to sum rpij(ε) = pij(ε) + pir(ε) ·
1−prr(ε) .
The asymptotic expansions for probabilities pij(ε), pir(ε), and prj(ε), given
in condition B, and probability 1 −prr(ε), given in Lemma 8, should be used.
If j /∈ Yi then pij(ε) ≡ 0; if j /∈ Yr then prj(ε) ≡ 0; if r /∈ Yi then pir(ε) ≡ 0;
if r /∈ Yr then 1 − prr(ε) ≡ 1. In these cases, the above algorithm is readily
simpliﬁed with the use of Lemma 4. Note that parameter ε0 does not change
in the multiplication and summation steps as well as in the division step, since

17

1 − prr(ε) > 0, ε ∈ (0, ε0]. According to Lemma 2, the (rl−

Remark 4. The matrix of transition probabilities krpij(ε)k is stochastic,
for every ε ∈ (0, ε0]. Thus, under conditions of Theorem 2, condition F holds
for the asymptotic expansions of transition probabilities rpij(ε), j ∈ rYi, i ∈
rX, given in this theorem.

Let us now describe an algorithm for construction of asymptotic expan-

sions for expectations reij(ε) given by relation (17).

Theorem 3. Conditions A – E, assumed to hold for the semi-Markov
processes η(ε)(t), also hold for the reduced semi-Markov processes rη(ε)(t).
Parameter ε0, in conditions A, D and E, is the same for processes η(ε)(t)
and rη(ε)(t). The transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX are given for processes rη(ε)(t)
by relation (15). The pivotal (rm−
ij)-expansions penetrating condition E
are given for expectations reij(ε), j ∈ rYi, i ∈ rX by the algorithm described
below, in the proof of the theorem.

ij, rm+

Proof. Lemma 6 and Theorem 2 imply that conditions A and D hold
for the semi-Markov processes rη(ε)(t), with the same parameter ε0 as for the
semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t), and the transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX given by
relation (15). Also, conditions B and C hold for the semi-Markov processes
rη(ε)(t), by Lemma 7.

In order to prove that condition E also holds for the semi-Markov pro-
cesses rη(ε)(t), with the same parameter ε0 and the transition sets rYi, i ∈ rX
given by relation (15), let us construct the corresponding asymptotic ex-
pansions penetrating this condition. Let j, r ∈ Yi ∩ Yr. First, propo-
sition (v) (the division rule) of Lemma 2 should be applied to the quo-

prj(ε)
Lemma 3 to the product err(ε) ·
1−prr(ε). Third, proposition (i) (the
multiple summation rule) of Lemma 3 should be applied to sum reij(ε) =
eij(ε)+eir(ε)· prj(ε)
1−prr(ε) . The asymptotic
expansions for probabilities pij(ε), pir(ε) and prj(ε), given in condition D,
probability 1−prr(ε), given in Lemma 8, and expectations eij(ε), eir(ε), err(ε)
and erj(ε), given in condition E, should be used. If j /∈ Yi then pij(ε) ≡ 0

pir(ε) ≡ 0 and eir(ε) ≡ 0; if r /∈ Yr then 1 − prr(ε) ≡ 1 and err(ε) ≡ 0. In
these cases, the above algorithm is readily simpliﬁed with the use of Lemma
4. As in Theorem 2, parameter ε0 does not change in the multiplication
and summation steps as well as in the division step, since 1 − prr(ε) >
0, ε ∈ (0, ε0]. According to Lemmas 2 and 3, the (rm−

It is worth to note that, despite bulky forms, formulas for parameters
and algorithms for computing coeﬃcients in the asymptotic expansions, pre-
sented in Lemma 8 and Theorems 2 and 3, are computationally eﬀective.

7. Sequential reduction of phase spaces for perturbed semi-

Markov processes

In what follows, let ¯ri,N = hri,1, . . . , ri,N i = hri,1, . . . , ri,N −1, ii be a per-
mutation of the sequence h1, . . . , Ni such that ri,N = i, and let ¯ri,n =
hri,1, . . . , ri,ni, n = 1, . . . , N be the corresponding chain of growing sequences
of states from space X.

Theorem 4. Let conditions A – E hold for semi-Markov processes η(ε)(t).
Then, for every i ∈ X, the pivotal (M −
ii )-expansion for the expecta-
tion of hitting time Eii(ε) is given by the algorithm based on the sequen-
tial exclusion of states ri,1, . . . , ri,N −1 from the phase space X of the pro-
cesses η(ε)(t). This algorithm is described below, in the proof of the theorem.
The above (M −

Proof. Let us assume that p(ε)

initial semi-Markov process. Let us exclude state ri,1 from the phase space

described in Section 5. Let ¯ri,1η(ε)(t) be the corresponding reduced semi-
Markov process. The above procedure can be repeated. The state ri,2 can
be excluded from the phase space of the semi-Markov process ¯ri,1η(ε)(t). Let
¯ri,2η(ε)(t) be the corresponding reduced semi-Markov process. By continuing
the above procedure for states ri,3, . . . , ri,n, we construct the reduced semi-
Markov process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t).

The process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t) has the phase space ¯ri,n

X, and the expectations of sojourn times ¯ri,nei′j′(ε), i′, j′ ∈ ¯ri,n

The transition probabilities of the embedded Markov chain ¯ri,npi′j′(ε), i′, j′ ∈
X are deter-
¯ri,n
mined for the semi-Markov process ¯ri,nη(ε)(t) by the transition probabilities
and the expectations of sojourn times for the process ¯ri,n−1η(ε)(t), respectively,
via relations (14) and (17).

By Theorem 1, the expectation of hitting time Ei′j′(ε) coincides for the
semi-Markov processes ¯ri,0η(ε)(t), ¯ri,1η(ε)(t), . . . , ¯ri,nη(ε)(t), for every i′, j′ ∈
¯ri,n

By Theorems 2 and 3, the semi-Markov processes ¯ri,nη(ε)(t) satisﬁes con-
ditions B, C and, also, conditions A, D and E, with the same parameter
ε0 as for processes ¯ri,n−1η(ε)(t). The transition sets ¯ri,n

For every j′ ∈ ¯ri,n

This implies that the transition probability ¯ri,npi′j′(ε) and the expecta-
tion ¯ri,nei′j′(ε) are, for every j′ ∈ ¯ri,n
X, n = 1, . . . , N − 1, invari-
ant (as functions of ε) with respect to any permutation ¯r′
i,n of the sequence
¯ri,n. Moreover, as follows from algorithms presented above, in Lemma 8 and
Theorems 2 and 3, the transition probability ¯ri,npi′j′(ε) is a rational func-
tion of the initial transition probabilities pi′′j′′(ε), j′′ ∈ Yi′′, i′′ ∈ X, and the
expectation ¯ri,nei′j′(ε) is a rational function of the initial transition probabil-
ities pi′′j′′(ε), j′′ ∈ Yi′′, i′′ ∈ X and the initial expectations of sojourn times
ei′′j′′(ε), j′′ ∈ Yi′′, i′′ ∈ X (quotients of sums of products for some of these
probabilities and expectations), which, according the above remarks, are in-
variant with respect to any permutation ¯r′

i,n of the sequence ¯ri,n.

By using identity arithmetical transformations (disclosure of brackets,
imposition of a common factor out of the brackets, bringing a fractional
expression to a common denominator, permutation of summands or mul-
tipliers, elimination of expressions with equal absolute values and opposite
signs in the sums and elimination of equal expressions in quotients) the ratio-
ei′j′(ε) can be transformed, respectively, into
nal functions ¯r′
the rational functions ¯ri,npi′j′(ε) and ¯ri,nei′j′(ε) and wise versa. By Lemma
4, these transformations do not aﬀect the corresponding asymptotic expan-
sions for functions ¯ri,npi′j′(ε) and ¯ri,nei′j′(ε) and, thus, these expansions are
invariant with respect to any permutation ¯r′

i,n of the sequence ¯ri,n.

In fact, one should only check the above invariance propositions for the
case, where the permutations ¯r′
i,n is obtained from the sequence ¯ri,n by ex-
change of a pair of neighbor states ri,k and ri,k+1, for some 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
Then, the proof can be repeated for a pair of neighbor states for the se-
quence ¯r′
i,n, etc. In this way, the proof can be expanded to the case of an
arbitrary permutation ¯r′
i,n of the sequence ¯ri,n. The above mentioned poof of
pairwise permutation invariance involves processes ¯ri,k−1η(ε)(t), ¯ri,kη(ε)(t) and
¯ri,k+1η(ε)(t). It is absolutely analogous, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Taking this into
account, we just show how this proof can be accomplished for the case k = 1.
pi′j′(ε) for the sequences
¯ri,2 = (r1, r2) and ¯r′
i,2 = (r2, r1) (here, i, i′, j′ 6= r1, r2) can be transformed into
the same symmetric (with respect to r1, r2) rational function of ε ∈ (0, ε0],

Therefore, by Lemma 4, the Laurent asymptotic expansions for transition

The proof of identity for the Laurent asymptotic expansions of expecta-
ei′j′(ε), given by the recurrent algorithm of sequential

Let us take n = N − 1. In this case, the semi-Markov process ¯ri,N −1η(ε)(t)
X = X \ {ri,1, ri,2, . . . , ri,N −1} = {i}, which is a

Its transition probability ¯ri,N −1pii(ε) = 1 and the expectation of hitting time
Eii(ε) = ¯ri,N −1eii(ε).

Thus, the above recurrent algorithm of sequential phase space reduction
makes it possible to write down the following pivotal Laurent asymptotic

By the above remarks, the asymptotic expansion given in relation (22)

This legitimates notations (with omitted index ¯ri,N −1) used for parameters,

The algorithm for construction of the Laurent asymptotic expansion for

8. Asymptotic expansions for stationary distributions of non-

linearly perturbed semi-Markov processes

In this section, we describe an algorithm for construction of asymptotic
expansions for stationary distributions of nonlinearly perturbed semi-Markov
processes.

The following theorem is the main new result in Part I of the present

paper.

Theorem 5. Let conditions A – E hold for semi-Markov processes
η(ε)(t). Then, for every i ∈ X, the pivotal (n−
i )-expansion for the sta-
tionary probability πi(ε) is given by the algorithm based on the sequential
exclusion of states ri,1, . . . , ri,N −1 from the phase space X of the processes
η(ε)(t). This algorithm is described below, in the proof of the theorem. The
above (n−
i )-expansion is invariant with respect to any permutation ¯ri,N =
hri,1, . . ., ri,N −1, ii of sequence h1, . . . , Ni. Relations (1) – (6), given in the
proof, hold for these expansions.

Proof. First, condition E and proposition (i) (the multiple summation

Second, conditions A – E, the asymptotic expansions given in relations

πi(ε) = ei(ε)

As follows from Theorem 4, the asymptotic expansion (22) for expectation
Eii(ε) and, thus, the asymptotic expansion (24) for stationary probability
πi(ε) is, for every i ∈ X, invariant with respect to any permutation ¯ri,N =
hri,1, . . . , ri,N −1, ii of sequence h1, . . . , Ni. (cid:3)

It is appropriate to add some comments concerned two key components

of the method proposed in the paper.

First of all, we would like to stress the principal role of semi-Markov
setting used instead of a more traditional Markov setting. The time-space
screening procedure used in the paper transforms any initial semi-Markov
process to a new semi-Markov process with reduced phase space. Moreover,
this procedure transforms the initial perturbation conditions, given in the
form of asymptotic expansions for transition probabilities and expectations
of sojourn times, to similar perturbation conditions for the reduced semi-
Markov processes. However, this time-space screening procedure does not
preserve Markov setting, except some trivial cases. Usually, this procedure,

24

applied to a discrete or continuous time Markov chain, results in a semi-
Markov process, which is not a Markov chain. This is because of the times
between sequential hitting of the reduced phase space by the initial process,
as a rule, have distributions, which diﬀer of geometrical or exponential ones.
Also, the use of Laurent asymptotic expansions for expectations of sojourn
times for perturbed semi-Markov processes is an adequate and necessary el-
ement of the method. Expectations of sojourn times may be asymptotically
bounded (as functions of the perturbation parameter) and represented by
Taylor asymptotic expansions, for all states of the initial semi-Markov pro-
cesses. Even in this case, the exclusion of asymptotically absorbing states
from the phase space can cause appearance of states with asymptotically
unbounded expectations of sojourn times represented by Laurent asymptotic
expansions, for the reduced semi-Markov processes.

In conclusion, we would like to mention that the results presented in the
paper have a good potential for continuation of research studies (asymptotic
expansions for power and exponential moments for hitting times, asymptotic
expansions for quasi-stationary distributions, aggregated time-space screen-
ing procedures, etc.). Some more detailed comments are given in the last
section of Part II of the paper.
