Abstract. Using trapped ion quantum bits in a scalable microfabricated surface
trap, we perform the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Our architecture relies upon
ion transport and can readily be expanded to larger systems. The algorithm is
demonstrated using two- and three-ion chains. For three ions, an improvement is
achieved compared to a classical system using the same number of oracle queries. For
two ions and one query, we correctly determine an unknown bit string with probability
97.6(8)%. For three ions, we succeed with probability 80.9(3)%.

1. Introduction

The Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithm helped to solidify the potential promise of
quantum computers. The algorithm was the ﬁrst example of a quasi-polynomial speed-
up over a probabilistic classical computer [1, 2].
In this work, we demonstrate this
elementary quantum algorithm in a scalable system with trapped ion qubits. With three
qubits and one oracle query we can determine a hidden two-bit string with higher ﬁdelity
than the 50% success rate of a classical algorithm. The experiment takes advantage of
the transport capabilities of a microfabricated ion trap. Our work may serve as a
blueprint for one node in a larger quantum system based upon ion transport [3].

The goal of the BV algorithm is to determine a secret string s ∈ {0, 1}n. We are
given access to an oracle which adds s · x (mod 2) to an ancilla bit a, where x is a user
provided n-bit string. One can solve the classical version of the problem by querying
the oracle n times with x = 2i, i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. By examining the value of a after
each run, the user can determine the ith bit of s. However, using the BV quantum
algorithm, s can be determined with one oracle query. By bracketing the oracle query
with Hadamard transformations and preparing a = 1 to generate a phase kickback [4],
the action of the oracle on the ancilla results in the bits of s being mapped onto the bits
in x. To determine s, one need only measure the state of the data qubits (the ancilla
qubit is returned to the |1(cid:105) state). The algorithm provides a polynomial speed-up by
a factor of n for a single string s. It can achieve a quasi-polynomial speed-up for the
recursed problem [5].

The circuit for the BV algorithm, shown in ﬁgure 1(a), contains the standard motif
of a classical oracle transformed by Hadamard gates. Up to the oracle, this is the same
blueprint used for Deutsch and Jozsa’s quantum algorithm and a key component of
Grover’s search algorithm [4]. If the input Hadamard gate on the ancilla qubit is not
performed, the circuit can be used to solve the learning parity with noise problem [6, 7].

the data bits xi and can be determined in a single run of the algorithm.

implementation of the BV algorithm with three ions. The ancilla qubit is in the center
of the three-ion chain. The oracle is implemented via two cnot gates. The execution
of these gates is conditioned on the classical bits in s.

To implement the BV algorithm, we require an oracle that can perform the unitary

where ⊕ is addition modulo 2. We build this oracle from a series of cnot gates acting

ancilla qubit is the target bit in each cnot. To implement the dot product between s
and x, the application of each cnot is conditioned on the classical bits in s, i.e. we
only perform a cnot between xi and a if si = 1.

2. Experiment Overview

We demonstrate the BV algorithm using a chain of 171Yb+ ions in a microfabricated
surface trap. The trap is described in [8] and further details on 171Yb+ trapping can be
found in [9]. In this system, single ions are sequentially loaded and then merged into a
common harmonic well to build a chain of the desired length.

Following [10, 11], gates are performed via a Raman transition using a mode-locked,
tripled YAG laser with a 355 nm wavelength and a repetition rate of νr = 119.12(1) MHz.
Pairs of comb teeth separated by 106 × νr span the 12.6 GHz qubit hyperﬁne splitting
ν0, such that ν0 = (106 × νr) + ∆. The necessary correction frequency, ∆ (cid:39) 16 MHz,
changes with drifts in νr. To monitor this, we measure the beat between combteeth
spaced by 14×νr. We feed this signal forward to an acousto-optic modulator (AOM)
to add (200 + ∆) MHz to one of our counter-propagating Raman beams. A second
AOM shifts the frequency of the other Raman beam by 200 MHz for resonant carrier
interactions and by small oﬀsets from 200 MHz to address motional modes.

While quantum algorithms have already been performed in three dimensional ion
traps [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], this is the ﬁrst demonstration in a microfabricated planar
trap. The use of microfabrication permits scaling to larger algorithm demonstrations
by enabling repeatable production of many electrodes for ion transport, as well as
integration of detection optics [17] and control electronics [18]. These features will
prove useful for implementing many-ion quantum systems [3, 19].

Universal control over the ion chain is accomplished by addressing ions pairwise,
as described in [20]. Brieﬂy, we transport the ion chain between a set of discrete
gate locations. At each location, the gate lasers are pulsed on, and one pair of ions
is illuminated. Entanglement is provided by nearest-neighbor Mølmer-Sørensen (MS)
interactions [21]. To generate independent single qubit unitaries, we perform a cascade:
a unitary operation at each successive gate location across the chain. Each unitary is
composed of PB1-stabilized π/2 rotations Rϕ(π/2), where ϕ labels the axis of rotation
in the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere. The PB1 passband compensating sequence
serves to alleviate amplitude errors on the two targeted ions and suppress rotations on
the others [22, 23, 24]. We have built a compiler that ﬁnds a minimum set of rotations to
construct a desired single qubit unitary. Additionally, the compiler compacts requested
single qubit gates into one unitary while accounting for previous operations in the
cascade. It also accounts for the oﬀ-resonant light shifts described below.

3. System Improvements

While we employ the same beam geometry as [20], system improvements have led to
the increased gate ﬁdelities reported in table 1. One arm of our Raman beam pair
now propagates through a 300 mm segment of photonic crystal ﬁber (LMA-PM-5,
NKT Photonics) before it is focused down to the trapping region. The mounted ﬁber
provides improved beam mode quality and reduced spatial beam wander from free space
propagation of the tripled YAG laser. The output of the ﬁber is focused to a waist (1/e2
intensity half-width) of roughly 5 µm, whereas the waist of the other arm of the Raman
beam pair is 14 µm. The 1/e half-width of the Raman interaction is largely set by the 5
µm beam, which is slightly less than the ion spacing of the chain. Without utilizing the
hydrogen loading treatment outlined in [25], we cannot propagate more than 20 mW of
355 nm light through the ﬁber without solarization over a few days of operation. Thus,
to perform pairwise single qubit π/2 rotations in 6 µs, we send 1 mW through the ﬁber
and 110 mW through the other free-space Raman beam. We propagate 2 mW through
the ﬁber to implement MS gates in approximately 160 µs.

ﬁdelities are characterized according to the following procedure: all ions are prepared
in the |0(cid:105) state, a pairwise MS gate is performed, and then a parity measurement. We
report the ﬁdelity of Bell state creation (FBell) following the methods in [27]. We also
report P1, the unwanted |1(cid:105) population in the untargeted ion, to indicate the level of
crosstalk during MS gates.

In [20], we describe errors due to imperfect overlap between the red and blue
sideband beams during MS gates. This is now mitigated by propagating both sideband
beams through the same ﬁber, improving the Bell-state ﬁdelities between addressed ions
as presented in table 1. The addition of the ﬁber also nearly halves the crosstalk during
pairwise MS gates on three ions. This is exempliﬁed by the population in |1(cid:105) of the
unaddressed ion after Bell state preparation (P1 in table 1).

We also discuss errors from imperfect pairwise addressing during single qubit
operations in [20]. We employed the PB1 sequence in that work, however the suppression
was not suﬃcient to neglect population transfer on ions adjacent to the addressed
pair (“neighbor ions”). With the ﬁber in place, the tighter beam focus and improved
mode quality reduce the Rabi rate of neighbor ions to less than 20% of the addressed

Transport Implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm with Ion Qubits

ions. Under these conditions, for each resonant PB1-stabilized π/2 rotation, we expect
neighbor ions to experience a worst case inﬁdelity of 1 − F = 7 × 10−4 with respect to
the identity operation. This suppression allows us to neglect these unwanted neighbor
ion rotations in our compiled algorithm.

Carrier transitions on a pair of ions still exhibit some crosstalk with the rest of the
chain. Each Raman beam can induce Raman transitions by itself due to interactions
of pairs of comb teeth. The laser repetition rate was chosen such that these single-
beam interactions are well detuned from the carrier transition. However, oﬀ-resonant
couplings introduce a non-negligible shift in the qubit energy splitting. The magnitude
of the dominant component of this light shift is δac = Ω2
ac/2∆, where Ωac is the Rabi
frequency of the shifting laser ﬁeld. In our experiment, Ωac depends on an ion’s location
in the beam, thus we measure the shift for each ion at each gate location using Ramsey
spectroscopy. For the free-space beam, we measure ∼ 650 Hz shifts when an ion is
targeted, ∼ 350 Hz shifts when it is a neighbor, and ∼ 100 Hz shifts when it is two
locations away from the target pair. Shifts due to the ﬁber-coupled beam are small
(< 60 Hz) and localized onto the targeted ion pair.

We model the total light shift as a constant detuning during gate pulses. On target
ions, the PB1 sequence corrects for the shifts well, and we expect PB1-stabilized π/2
rotation inﬁdelities of 7× 10−5. For untargeted ions, the sequence cannot correct for the
shift. However, the error is well approximated by a z-rotation Rz(φ), where φ = 2πδτPB1,
δ is the measured frequency shift in Hz, and the time per PB1 sequence, τPB1, is 102 µs.
For ions well outside of the beam, this approximation becomes exact. To incorporate
these rotations in our gate compiler, anytime we perform a gate operation, we include
Rz(φ) for each untargeted ion.

We believe that the primary error source for single qubit Cliﬀord operations is
phase noise in the Raman interaction due to imperfect tracking of νr. Figure 2 shows
results from numerical simulations of two-ion randomized benchmarking after ﬁfteen
Cliﬀord operations per ion. To match our physical implementation, the simulations
incorporate each gate laser pulse, account for hardware programming delays, and include
the time for ion transport. We plot single qubit Cliﬀord gate ﬁdelity as a function of the
frequency of an applied phase noise. The phase noise is modeled at a single frequency
and of modulation depth 0.02 radians. Noise in the 20 kHz - 60 kHz frequency range
is particularly detrimental. The period of this noise (16 µs - 50 µs) is on the order of
τPB1. We have observed noise near this sensitive band using the techniques described in
[28]. However, technical limitations prevented us from measuring noise with frequency
greater than 15 kHz. In future work, we hope to characterize and mitigate these noise
sources for higher ﬁdelity operation.

4. Algorithm Implementation

Each implementation of the algorithm begins with Doppler cooling and Raman sideband
cooling. After cooling, we measure an average temperature of nCOM = 0.6(1) quanta

Figure 2.
Simulated Cliﬀord gate ﬁdelity as a function of frequency of applied
phase noise. Each simulation is an average over 50 randomly generated randomized
benchmarking sequences, each with 15 gates per ion and a random starting phase of
our noise source. In our cascading architecture, Ion 0 is targeted for twice as many
PB1 pulse sequences as Ion 1 on average. As expected, the simulation shows that the
larger number of noisy gate operations leads to a higher error rate for Ion 0. The
dashed lines indicate the measured randomized benchmarking ﬁdelities for each ion in
a two-ion chain.

in the radial center of mass (COM) mode. All other radial modes are cooled to an
average temperature below 0.1 quanta. The ions are then initialized to |0⊗n+1(cid:105) via
optical pumping. We follow this with a cascade of single qubit rotations to Hadamard
(|0(cid:105) − |1(cid:105)).
transform each data qubit to |+(cid:105) = 1√
In the three-ion case, the ancilla qubit is the middle ion of the chain to allow for nearest-
neighbor MS gates, as shown in ﬁgure 3. To separate the input state preparation from
the oracle implementation, these preparation gates are not compiled into any subsequent
gates.

(|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105)) and the ancilla to |−(cid:105) = 1√

To apply the oracle operation, cnot gates are performed between each data ion
and the ancilla, conditioned on the value of s. cnot gates are built from MS gates
with particular single qubit rotations before and after, as shown in ﬁgure 3(a). Due to
increased axial conﬁnement used during MS gates [20], we sample a diﬀerent phase of
our Raman beams than during single qubit gate operations. To negate this frame shift,
we add phase corrections Rz(ϕa,b) and Rz(−ϕa,b − ϕr) to our compiled algorithm. The
phase ϕr accounts for light shifts accumulated during the MS gate. To accommodate
these phase shifts in the fewest number of physical π/2 rotations, we insert optimization
gates O(ϕ), where ϕ is a free parameter in the gate compilation. As described in [20],
the addition of these gates still produces the desired cnot.

cnot gates need to be turned on and oﬀ conditioned on the bits in s. If si = 0, all
the transport associated with each gate is performed, however the gate lasers are not
turned on. This ensures algorithm honesty, as we do not optimize for any particular
value of s. Each cnot block is compiled separately from all other algorithm sections
so that it can be turned on or oﬀ without eﬀecting the rest of the circuit.

The algorithm is broken up into four sections. The state preparation and analysis
pulses are shown in the two yellow boxes. Conditional cnot gates carry out the
function of the oracle. Each cnot contains a phase corrected MS gate, discussed in
section 4. Gate operations in each section are compiled to reduce the total number
of operations. However, gates across sections are not compiled.

pulse operation about an axis ϕ in the equatorial plane.

The oracle is followed by Hadamard gates on each ion and individual-ion state
detection. In total, the algorithm takes 3.9 ms for two ions and 9.8 ms for three ions.
The two-ion algorithm employs nine transport operations, and the three-ion algorithm
requires nineteen. Each adiabatic transport is performed in 100 µs.

5. Algorithm Output

To compare the BV algorithm to its classical counterpart, one can imagine that the user
is given access to one classical query of the oracle which provides the value of a single
bit in s. Then he or she must guess the remaining bits. Thus, for an n-bit secret string
s, the user will guess the string correctly with probability 2−n+1. We implement the BV
quantum algorithm for n = 1, 2 and provide state detection results in ﬁgure 4.

For n = 1, a classical system can determine the single bit in s correctly 100% of
the time. We ﬁnd a quantum success probability of 97.6(8)%, averaged over the two
oracle states. This is taken by summing over the states where the data bit s is in
the correct state, regardless of the state of the ancilla. In the s = 0 case, we perform
six PB1-stabilized π/2 rotations. Based upon randomized benchmarking sequences of
similar length, we expect the correct output state with ﬁdelity of 95(3)%. When s = 1,
we employ ﬁfteen PB1-stabilized π/2 rotations and one MS gate. Treating the error
from the two gate types as uncorrelated, we expect an output state ﬁdelity of 89(3)%.
The quoted uncertainties in our predictions correspond to the spread of randomized
benchmarking results. The results in both cases of ﬁgure 4(a) are consistent with their
respective predictions to within two standard deviations.

For n = 2, we correctly determine the bit string s with probability 80.9(3)%,
averaged over the four oracle states. This is an improvement over the classical success

rate of 50% for a single query. Furthermore, we can use information theory to determine
the information gained by one run of this algorithm. We calculate the entropy reduction
of one pass of the algorithm by examining the mutual information between our algorithm
output x and a bit string s [13, 29]. Classically, as expected, the user gains exactly one
bit of information per oracle query. Quantum mechanically we gain 1.10(3) bits of
information.

In the three-qubit algorithm, our largest source of error is the MS gate on the 12
pair. This gate is the lowest ﬁdelity operation in the system and causes signiﬁcant
crosstalk on the untargeted ion. This manifests itself in the algorithm output as a large
correlation between the |110(cid:105) and |111(cid:105) states when the gate is performed. When s = 10
there is 14.8(5)% population in the |111(cid:105) state, and when s = 11 there is 17.3(5)% build
up in |110(cid:105). These populations have a drastic eﬀect on algorithm ﬁdelity and reduce
the target output states below 80%. Preliminary work with the “echo” decoupling
technique discussed in [20] improves FBell to 87.9(1.0)% and reduces P1 to 3.4(4)%. The
echo involves splitting the MS gate in half, ensuring the spin-motion entanglement is

zero after each half, and inserting a Y gate on the targeted (or untargeted) ions after
each half. At present, the additional errors introduced by the extra set of single qubit
operations outweigh the improved decoupling. We expect that with improved single
qubit operation ﬁdelities we can incorporate this technique in our algorithm.

6. Scaling

One concern for scaling such an architecture is motional mode excitation due to
anomalous heating and ion transport. We measure an anomalous heating rate of 50(6)
quanta/s on the COM mode. Heating on other modes is less than 7 quanta/s. The
MS two-qubit interaction and the PB1 pulse sequence were chosen to help mitigate gate
errors due to increasing ion temperature. We do not believe that these errors are a
current ﬁdelity limitation.

For MS gates, we couple mainly to the rocking mode to avoid the larger anomalous
heating rate of the COM mode [30]. We have simulated the density matrix evolution
of a two-ion MS gate, expanding the Hamiltonian out to third order in the Lamb-Dicke
parameter. Following [21], we incorporated a coupling between vibrational states and
a thermal reservoir. This predicts that heating on the COM mode will cause errors on
the order of 10−4 per gate.

For single qubit operations, the PB1 sequence largely alleviates the carrier Rabi rate
dependence on ion temperature. Simulations of a two-ion chain indicate that we require
nCOM ≥ 5.5 quanta to accumulate a sizable inﬁdelity (> 10−4) per PB1-stabilized π/2
rotation. After performing the two-ion BV algorithm with transport, but with gate
lasers oﬀ, we measure nCOM = 0.9(1).

In a three-ion chain, we require nCOM ≥ 8.5 quanta to exceed the same error
threshold. The discrepancy compared to the two-ion case is due to the diﬀerent Lamb-
Dicke parameters. We measure nCOM = 1.6(1) quanta after the three-ion BV algorithm
with transport. If we replace the algorithm with an equivalent delay, nCOM is consistent
at 1.8(1) quanta. This aﬃrms that the nineteen transport operations, each of about
5 µm, are not a signiﬁcant source of additional heating.

Thus, at our current heating rate, we do not expect that increasing ion temperature
contributes largely to gate inﬁdelities during the BV algorithm. However, as ﬁdelities
improve, scaling the system up may require implementation of proven technologies to
reduce the heating rate [31, 32], to transport more quickly [33], and to allow for cooling
after transport [34].

An additional impediment to scaling up is that we are currently limited to nearest-
neighbor cnot gates. However, we can add swap operations, built from three cnots, to
alleviate this restriction. Another option is to employ the MS echo decoupling technique
to generate entanglement between non-nearest neighbors [20]. Finally, we could address
the ions with two sets of Raman beams, each focused for individual ion addressing [16].
This would also allow two-qubit operations between any pair of ions and would eliminate
the need for a cascade during single qubit operations.

7. Outlook

In this work, we have demonstrated a quantum algorithm in a microfabricated ion trap
using transport-based ion addressing. Our three-ion implementation of the algorithm
provides the user with more information than its classical counterpart. We utilized
temperature-insensitive gate operations to mitigate the eﬀects of ion-heating. By
demonstrating qubit control interlaced with up to nineteen transport operations, we
aﬃrm the exceptional transport capabilities of surface electrode traps.
