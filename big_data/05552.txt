Abstract

This paper develops a method to compute any bosonic conformal block as a series
expansion in the optimal radial coordinate introduced by Hogervorst and Rychkov. The
method reduces to the known result when the external operators are all the same scalar
operator, but it allows to compute conformal blocks for external operators with spin.
Moreover, we explain how to write closed form recursion relations for the coeﬃcients of
the expansions. We study three examples of four point functions in detail: one vector
and three scalars; two vectors and two scalars; two spin 2 tensors and two scalars.
Finally, for the case of two external vectors, we also provide a more eﬃcient way to
generate the series expansion using the analytic structure of the blocks as a function
of the scaling dimension of the exchanged operator.

The conformal bootstrap is opening a new window into quantum ﬁeld theory beyond pertur-
bation theory [1–34]. In this paper we present a method to construct any bosonic conformal
block (CB), an essential ingredient to formulate the conformal bootstrap equations.

Constructing general CBs is still an open problem. The exceptions are for three [35] and
four [36] dimensions. 1 In these cases it was possible to construct the full set of seed blocks

1 In two dimensions, the CBs associated to the global conformal group are known in closed form [37].

1

which are suﬃcient to determine all CBs by acting with diﬀerential operators [26, 38, 39].
However for general spacetime dimensions the problem is far from being solved.
In fact,
when the external operators have spin and the exchanged operator is not in the symmetric
traceless representation of SO(d) there is no systematic way to determine the blocks. 2

The paper is divided into two parts. The main goal is to explain how to generalize
the series expansion in the radial coordinate introduced by [42] for any bosonic conformal
block in general dimension. This gives rise to a simple way to build CBs in a form which is
suitable to the numerical bootstrap approach. Moreover it unravels their connection with the
structure of the exchanged conformal representations. In the text, we restrict our attention
to external operators in the symmetric traceless representation of SO(d) but this can be
easily generalized using the methods of [40]. In section 2 we review the result of [42] for the
scalar CB (we actually consider the slightly more general case of scalar operators of diﬀerent
dimension). As a new result, we explain a strategy to obtain a closed form recurrence
relation for the coeﬃcients of the expansion. In section 3 we generalize this technology in
order to deal with external operators with spin. We then exemplify the method in three
cases: one external vector and three scalars, two external vectors and two scalars and two
spin 2 operators and two scalars. Moreover, we explain how to obtain recurrence relations
for the coeﬃcients of the expansions in general cases, and how to simplify these recurrence
relation in order to make them more eﬃcient (see also appendix A on this point). For clarity
of exposition we give examples of simpliﬁed closed form recurrence relations only for the two
cases of one external vector and three scalars and two external vectors and two scalars. For
concreteness we also added to the arXiv submission some Mathematica ﬁles which compute
the blocks using the recurrence relations for the coeﬃcients.

In section 4 we use an alternative method to ﬁnd a radial expansion for CBs, by recon-
structing their analytic structure as a function of the conformal dimension of the exchanged
operator. This method is based on an idea of Zamolodchikov for two dimensional CFTs [43].
It was recently developed in higher dimensions for the scalar conformal block [13, 18] and
for two external fermions and two scalars in three dimensions [35]. In [44] there was a ﬁrst
attempt to generalize this idea to general external bosonic operators in any dimension. How-
ever there was still no explicit computation of CBs for the exchange of a mixed symmetry
operator.In section 4, and also in appendix B, we compute the CBs for two external vectors
and two scalars for the exchange of both the symmetric and traceless representation, and the
. Again we submitted a Mathematica ﬁle
mixed symmetry representation (l, 1) =
which computes the blocks with this method. On one hand this result can be used to match
the radial expansion of section 3. More importantly it is a concrete example that shows that
the technology of [44] can actually be used to generate in principle any bosonic conformal
block.

• • •

Finally we conclude the paper with some comments on the possible strategies to obtain
more general CBs. We also added appendix C to explain how the idea of generating some
(not all) CBs for external operators with spin by acting with derivatives on the scalar seed

2Results in this direction can be obtained using the shadow formalism. In particular, [40, 41] considered
the CBs for two external scalars and two vectors. However this method requires further systematization in
order to address more general cases.

2 Review of the scalar conformal block

Let us start by introducing a four point function of scalar operators written in the embedding
space. We can expand it in conformal blocks as follows

(cid:104)O1(P1)O2(P2)O3(P3)O4(P4)(cid:105) =

c12Oc34OG∆,l(Pi) ,

(1)

(cid:88)

O

where the sum is over primary operators O with dimension ∆ and spin l. In the embedding
space formalism the points are represented by null rays

P =(cid:0)P 0, P µ, P d+1(cid:1) ∈ R1,d+1 ,

P 2 = −(cid:0)P 0(cid:1)2 +(cid:0)P d+1(cid:1)2

+ δµνP µP ν = 0 .

(2)

We will focus on the section δµνP µP ν = 1. This is naturally parametrized by an Euclidean
time τ ∈ R and a unit vector nµ ∈ Sd−1 ⊂ Rd,

(3)
The induced metric on this section is just the metric on the cylinder R × Sd−1, with line
element ds2 = dτ 2 + dΩ2
Sd−1. The following choice of conﬁguration leads to the radial
coordinates of [42],

P = (cosh τ, nµ, sinh τ ) .

P1 = (1, n, 0) ,
P2 = (1,−n, 0) ,

P3 = (cosh τ,−n(cid:48), sinh τ ) ,
P4 = (cosh τ, n(cid:48), sinh τ ) ,

(4)

with n and n(cid:48) unit vectors in Rd. This choice of null vectors in the embedding space corre-
sponds to the conﬁguration on the cylinder R × Sd−1 shown in ﬁgure 1.

Substituting the choice (4) for Pi in G∆,l we obtain the conformal block on the cylinder,

c12Oc34OG∆,l(Pi) → G∆,l(r, η) .

where we introduced the variables r and η of [42],

r = e−τ ,

η = n · n(cid:48) .

It is trivial to check that r and η are related to the usual cross ratios as follows

On the cylinder it is also possible to write

G∆,l(r, η) = (cid:104)O4(n(cid:48))O3(−n(cid:48))|rHcylPl|O2(−n)O1(n)(cid:105) ,

(8)
where Hcyl is the Hamiltonian on the cylinder and Pl is the projector into the conformal
family with primary O∆,l. It is natural to rewrite the projector as a sum over a complete set
of states

(9)

where the state |m, µ1 µ2 ··· µj , a(cid:105) represents descendants of the operator O at the level m and
with spin j. The label a distinguishes states at the same level and with the same spin. In
this case, the only states that contribute are symmetric traceless representations of SO(d)
because the inner products in (9) vanish for more general representations. The inner product
can be written as

(cid:104)m, µ1 µ2 ··· µj , a|O2(−n)O1(n)(cid:105) = u(m, j, a) n(µ1 ··· nµl) ,

(10)

where the parenthesis select only the traceless and symmetric part of the tensor. We may
choose to set u(0, l) = c12O. 3 From these deﬁnitions we automatically get

(13)

where h = d/2. The crucial point that makes the expansion (11) useful is that the coeﬃcients
w(m, j) inherit some properties from the structure the conformal representation exchanged
in the conformal block. For example, we automatically get that at level m = 0 in the
expansion there exists a single non-zero coeﬃcient. It corresponds to the exchange of the
primary, namely

w(0, j) = c12Oc34Oδj,l .

(14)
Moreover, all level m descendants must have spin j in the interval [max(0, l−m), l+m], since
they are created by the action of m derivatives, as each one of them can at most increase
or decrease the spin of the operator by one. Therefore the coeﬃcients have the following
structure

(15)
which is depicted in ﬁgure 2. In addition, if O4 = O1 and O3 = O2 then unitarity implies
that all coeﬃcients are non-negative, w(m, j) ≥ 0.

w(m, j) = 0 ,

|j − l| > m ,

2.2 A recurrence relation for the expansion coeﬃcients

We described the radial expansion for the conformal blocks, but we still need to ﬁx the
coeﬃcients w(m, j). In the following we explain how to use the conformal Casimir equation
to obtain a recurrence relation for w(m, j). To do so we ﬁrst exploit the conformal symmetry
to ﬁx the conformal partial wave in terms of a function depending only on the cross ratios,

We then write the conformal Casimir equation in the embedding space,

with

c∆,l = ∆(∆ − 2h) + l(2h + l − 2) ,

in such a way to obtain a second order diﬀerential equation for g∆,l(r, η). To constrain the
coeﬃcients w(m, j) we ﬁnally need to relate G∆,l(r, η) with g∆,l(r, η). This is trivial, we
simply have to write (16) using the deﬁnitions (4) for the points Pi on the cylinder,

G∆,l(r, η) = c12Oc34OP(r, η)g∆,l(r, η) ,

convince oneself that any Casimir equation can be casted in the form4

p(r, η, ∂r, ∂η)F(r, η) = 0 ,

(23)

where p(x1, x2, x3, x4) is a polynomial in the variables xi and we choose the order of the
variables such that the derivatives are on the right. As an example, (21) is of the form (23).
We want to show that if we expand F(r, η) as follows

F(r, η) =

am,jfm,j(r, η) ,

fm,j(r, η) = rmCj(η) ,

(24)

∞(cid:88)

m,j=0

we are able to recast the diﬀerential equation (23) as a closed form algebraic relation on
the coeﬃcients am,j. To do so we need to know the action of η, ∂η, r and ∂r on the basis
fm,j(r, η), that is

r fm,l(r, η) = fm+1,l(r, η) ,

η fm,l(r, η) =

2(h + l − 1)

∂η fm,l(r, η) =

∂r fm,l(r, η) = mfm−1,l(r, η) ,

(cid:0)l fm,l−1(r, η) + (2h + l − 2)fm,l+1(r, η)(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)fm,l−1(r, η) − fm,l+1(r, η)(cid:1) .

l(2h + l − 2)
2(h + l − 1)

(25)

Using these formulas recursively one can obtain the action of any polynomial p(r, η, ∂r, ∂η)
on fm,l. The only subtlety comes from the derivatives in η, since they bring a factor (1 − η2)
in the denominator. This is not a problem since we can multiply the full equation by (1− η2)
each time we use the last equation of (25). This is enough to show that we can rewrite (23)
as a closed form algebraic relation for the coeﬃcients am,j. Nevertheless, in appendix A we
explain useful manipulations to simplify the algebraic relations.

(cid:88)
((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j)∈S

Applying this technology to the diﬀerential equation (21) we obtain that a linear com-
bination of a ﬁnite number of coeﬃcients w(m, j) with some shifts in m and j is zero,
schematically

c((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j) w(m +(cid:98)m, j +(cid:98)j) = 0 .

(26)

The set S contains 30 points for example (0, 0), (−1, 1), (−1,−1), . . . , as pictured in ﬁgure

3, and c((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j) are known functions of the variables ∆12, ∆34, ∆, l, h, and m and j. We can

therefore express the coeﬃcient w(m, j) with maximal m (the point at the origin of the axes
in ﬁgure 3) as a linear combination of w(m(cid:48), j(cid:48)) with lower m(cid:48).

Moreover, if we set m = 0 in (26) we obtain a constraint on the possible initial conditions

(j − l)w(0, j) = 0 ,

(27)
which is solved imposing w(0, j) = 0 for j (cid:54)= l. For j = l, instead, the coeﬃcient w(0, l) is left
unrestricted. This is consistent with the initial condition (14) obtained from the structure
of the conformal families.

4Notice that the Casimir equations may contain rational functions of r and η. This is not a problem since

one can always multiply the full expression by all the denominators.

Notice also that the restriction on the initial condition, together with the shape of ﬁgure
3, imply that the coeﬃcients of the expansion organize as pictured in ﬁgure 2, which was
obtained from the properties of conformal families.

Equation (26) with the initial condition (14) is enough to determine recursively the
coeﬃcients w(m, j) for any m and j. We will not present here explicitly the relation (26)
since the formula is very long. Instead, it is deﬁned in a Mathematica ﬁle. As an example
we present the ﬁrst coeﬃcients of the expansion for generic parameters

w(1, l − 1) =

w(1, l + 1) =

.

,

(28)

Notice that they go to zero when ∆34 = 0 = ∆12, as expected from the results of [42].

Formula (26) is a new result, since in [42] it was not obtained a closed form recurrence
relation for the coeﬃcients of the expansion. The main reason for this is that the authors
of [42] kept some rational functions of r and η (which have inﬁnite expansion in small r)
in the Casimir diﬀerential equation. Thus the associated recurrence relation would have
had a set S containing an inﬁnite number of points. On the other hand, multiplying the
Casimir equation by all the denominators it becomes possible to ﬁnd a recurrence relation
with a ﬁnite set S. Notice that this example explicitly shows that there exist many possible
equivalent recurrence relations, which however are not equivalently eﬃcient.
In fact we
expand on this point in appendix A, where we explain some strategies to further reduce the
number of points in S with respect to the algorithm proposed in the main text.

3 Spinning conformal blocks

In this section we present the general framework to obtain the radial expansion of conformal
blocks for external bosonic operators with spin. Initially we exemplify the formalism applying
it to the simpler case of one external vector operator and three scalars, for which the allowed
exchanged operators are still symmetric and traceless. After that, in separate subsections,
we apply the method to the cases of two external vectors and two scalars, and of two spin 2
operators and two scalars. In these cases there are new mixed tensor operators that can be
exchanged.

3.1 General formalism and example of one vector and three scalars

We ﬁrst introduce the conformal block expansion in the embedding formalism of a four point
function of operators Oi with spin li and conformal dimension ∆i

p and q, which label the possible conformal invariant tensor structures of the three point
functions (cid:104)O1O2O(cid:105) and (cid:104)O3O4O(cid:105), respectively. Let us recall that the auxiliary variables
Zi are a convenient way to avoid dealing with tensor indices in embedding space, that is
O(P, Z) = Z A1 . . . Z AlOA1...Al(P ). As an example, for one external vector we have

(cid:104)O1(P1, Z1)O2(P2)O3(P3)O4(P4)(cid:105) =

The two possible values p = 1, 2 correspond to the two possible tensor structures of the
three-point function (cid:104)O1(P1, Z1)O2(P2)O(P, Z)(cid:105) between external operators O1, O2 and the
exchanged operator O, which in this example can only be symmetric traceless of generic
spin l. As in the scalar case, we are interested in writing the conformal blocks in the
cylinder conﬁguration. To do so we can use formulae (4) and the following deﬁnition for the
embedding space polarization vectors

Z1 = (z1 · n, z1, z1 · n) ,
Z2 = (−z2 · n, z2,−z2 · n) ,

Z3 = (−z3 · n(cid:48)eτ , z3,−z3 · n(cid:48)eτ ) ,
Z4 = (z4 · n(cid:48)eτ , z4, z4 · n(cid:48)eτ ) ,

(31)

where zi are polarization vectors in Rd which obey z2
it should [45]. With these deﬁnitions we get

i = 0. Notice that Z 2

i = Zi · Pi = 0, as

G∆,l = (n · z1)F1(r, η) + (n(cid:48) · z1)F2(r, η) .

On the other hand, just as for the scalar case (8), the conformal block on the cylinder

can be written as

Gλ(r, η, n · zi, n(cid:48) · zi, zi · zj) = (cid:104)O4(n(cid:48), z4)O3(−n(cid:48), z3)|rHcylPλ|O2(−n, z2)O1(n, z1)(cid:105) ,

(35)
where Pλ is the projector into the conformal family with highest weight λ. It is natural to
rewrite the projector as a sum over a complete basis of states

(cid:104)O4(n(cid:48), z4)O3(−n(cid:48), z3)|m, Y, a(cid:105)(cid:104)m, Y, a|O2(−n, z2)O1(n, z1)(cid:105) ,

where we sum over all states at level m of the conformal family, organized in irreducible

Y can only be symmetric and traceless, therefore

In this formalism we can easily deal with more complicated irreps Y of SO(d), which will
appear in the next sections. For now, we continue the study of the case with one external

12Oc34Oδj,l .

(42)

The functions Ws are the basic building blocks for the radial expansion. However they
are related in a non trivial way to the full partial wave Gλ in (29).
In the following we
explain how to relate these functions in a generic framework while always exemplifying it for
the case of one external vector operator.

As a ﬁrst step we relate the functions Ws to the functions Fs deﬁned in (33). For one

external vector this can be done expanding (40) and collecting terms according to (34),

F1(r, η) = W1(r, η) − η∂ηW2(r, η) ,

F2(r, η) = ∂ηW2(r, η) .

(43)

The second step is to relate the conformal partial waves Gλ to the functions Fs. To do
so we exploit conformal symmetry to write the full partial wave in terms of functions of the
cross ratios. This can be easily done for any conformal block in the embedding formalism,

Finally we map (44) to the cylinder using the deﬁnitions (4) and (31), and we collect terms
according to (33). In this way we obtain a linear relation between the functions gλ,s and Fs.

In the one vector case we only have two possible tensor structures in (44),

Q(1)(Pi, Zi) = V1,23 ,

Q(2)(Pi, Zi) = V1,43 ,

which can be evaluated on the cylinder using (4) and (31),

We then replace (47) and (20) in (44). Collecting terms according to (34) we ﬁnally get

(r2 − 2ηr + 1)1/2(r2 + 2ηr + 1)1/2 .

With the above relations we can write Gλ in terms of the functions Ws. The last step is
to ﬁnd a recurrence relation for the coeﬃcients ws(m, j) of the functions Ws. To do so, we
ﬁrst write the conformal Casimir equation in the embedding space,

(J1 + J2)2Gλ(Pi, Zi) = cλGλ(Pi, Zi) ,

cλ = ∆(∆ − 2h) +

We then write Gλ in terms of Ws, which leads to coupled diﬀerential equations for the func-
tions Ws. Repeating the same procedure described in the scalar case, we can trade (see
also appendix A) the diﬀerential equations for coupled recurrence relations on the coeﬃ-
cients ws(m, j). When we do this for the case of one external vector we obtain two coupled
recurrence relations of the kind (the precise formulae are deﬁned in a Mathematica ﬁle)

s(cid:48) of the second one are in ﬁgure 4(b). We
can then obtain the coeﬃcients of the expansion iterating (52) with the initial condition
(42). Equation (52) for m = 0 reduces to
(j − l)w1(0, j) = 0 ,

j(j − l)w2(0, j) = 0 ,

(53)

which constraints the possible initial conditions. In fact, (53) implies w1(0, j) = w2(0, j) = 0,
for any j (cid:54)= l. On the other hand, w1(0, l) and w2(0, l) are not constrained by equation (52).
This is consistent with the initial condition (42) that we derived from the structure of the
conformal families. The two independent solutions of equation (52) are the two conformal
blocks that we labeled with p = 1, 2. The last remark is that (52) does not constrain w2(m, 0).
This actually make sense since in (43) the function W2 only appears derived once in η and
therefore the j = 0 term is annihilated. In fact, for practical purposes one could redeﬁne W2
avoiding to sum over the terms with j = 0.

As an example we present all the coeﬃcients at level m = 1 of the expansion of the
∆,l. At level zero we set the initial condition

functions Ws, which build the conformal block G(p)
ws(0, l) = δs,p. Using (52) we therefore obtain

3.2 Two external vectors and two scalars

In this section we describe how to obtain a radial expansion for conformal blocks of two
external vectors and two scalars. In particular, we consider the following conformal block
decomposition

There exist four conformal partial waves G(p,q)
∆,l (for p, q = 1, 2) when the exchanged multiplet
has an highest weight O in the symmetric and traceless representation. Additionally, there
is a single partial wave G∆,l,1 when O is in the representation (∆, l, 1). We shall see that the
radial expansion allows us to ﬁnd all the cases at once.

13

First, we consider the contribution from each conformal family on the cylinder

c12Oc34OG∆,l,1(Pi, Zi) → G∆,l,1 .

(56)

p,q=1

On the cylinder, both these functions can be expanded in the following tensor structures

Gλ = z1 · n z3 · n(cid:48) F1(r, η) + z1 · n z3 · n F2(r, η)+

+ z1 · n(cid:48) z3 · n(cid:48) F3(r, η) + z1 · n(cid:48) z3 · n F4(r, η) + z1 · z3 F5(r, η) .

(57)

The functions Fs depend on the representation λ but we omit this label to avoid cluttering
the equations.

To implement the expansion (36) for two external vectors we need to consider the con-
tribution from two types of states at each level m (the descendants of the two SO(d) irreps
that are exchanged in this case). The ﬁrst is the same that we obtained in the one external
vector case (37). The second one is new, with a coupling between one of the vectors and one
of the scalars written as

where the normalization constant NV is introduced for later convenience. Notice that the
value at m = 0 of us(0, j) has to be diﬀerent depending on what is the representation λ of
the exchanged primary operator. In fact, if λ is the symmetric and traceless representation,
then

and when λ = (∆, l, 1), then

u0(0, l) = 0 ,

uq(0, l) = c(q)

a u2(m, j, a)(cid:101)u2(m, j, a) ,
a u0(m, j, a)(cid:101)u0(m, j, a) .

(66)

Next we want to write the conformal partial waves in terms of the functions Ws. First

we obtain the relation between Fs and Ws according to the deﬁnition (57),

(cid:2) − η∂ηW4(r, η) + W2(r, η) + ∂ηW5(r, η)(cid:3) ,
(cid:2) − η∂ηW4(r, η) + W3(r, η) + ∂ηW5(r, η)(cid:3) ,

Now we can already express the partial waves in terms of the function Ws. The last step is
to obtain a recurrence relation for the coeﬃcients ws of the series expansion (65).

As we did in the one external vector case we use the Casimir equation to obtain ﬁve
coupled diﬀerential equations involving the functions Ws. Then we rewrite them in the basis
of the expansion in such a way to get a recurrence relation for the coeﬃcients (see appendix
A). The result is a set of ﬁve coupled recurrence relations

s(cid:48)=1

(cid:88)
((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j)∈Ss

s(cid:48)

s(cid:48)((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j) ws(cid:48)(m +(cid:98)m, j +(cid:98)j) = 0 ,

cs

s = 1, . . . , 5 .

(73)

As before we represent the sets S s
s(cid:48) in ﬁgure 5. The colored circles are related to the value
of s(cid:48) in (73), s(cid:48) = 1 corresponds to the black dot, increasing values of s(cid:48) correspond to larger
circles. Each picture represents a diﬀerent recurrence relation. The recurrence relations (73)
for m = 0 reduce to

[c(∆,j) − cλ]w1(0, j) = 0 ,
j[c(∆,j) − cλ]w2(0, j) = 0 ,
j[c(∆,j) − cλ]w3(0, j) = 0 ,
j[c(∆,j) − cλ]w4(0, j) = 0 ,
j[c(∆,j,1) − cλ]w5(0, j) = 0 .

(74)

The coeﬃcients multiplying ws(0, j) depend on the representation λ of the exchanged primary
operator. For the exchange of a traceless symmetric representation λ = (∆, l), it is easy to
see that ws(0, j) = 0 for j (cid:54)= l. On the other hand, for j = l, equations (74) only impose
w5(0, l) = 0 leaving ws(0, l) for s = 1, 2, 3, 4 undetermined. These 4 independent solutions
correspond precisely to the 4 independent conformal blocks that we parametrized by (p, q)
with p, q = 1, 2. In the case of the representation λ = (∆, l, 1) we also ﬁnd ws(0, j) = 0 for
all j (cid:54)= l. For j = l, equation (74) implies ws(0, l) = 0 for s = 1, 2, 3, 4, and leaves w5(0, l)
as the only free parameter. This is consistent with the uniqueness of the conformal block
G∆,l,1.

It is interesting to notice that equations (74) do not constrain ws(0, 0) for s = 2, 3, 4, 5.
This should not come as a surprise since the functions Ws (with s = 2, 3, 4, 5) deﬁned in (67)
appear with a derivative in η which cancels the term O(η0). Therefore the only coeﬃcients
ws(j, m) (with s = 2, 3, 4, 5) that are physical are the ones with j > 0.

The coeﬃcients of the expansion of the functions Ws have the same structure as shown
in ﬁgure 2. As an example we want to show the coeﬃcients at level m = 1 for j = l + 1. In
the case of the conformal blocks G(p,q)
∆,l , these can be found inputting the initial conditions

and w5(1, l + 1) = 0. Notice that the w5(m, j) do not vanish in general. For exam-
ple, w5(1, l) (cid:54)= 0 because there is a descendant of the primary O∆,l in the representation
(∆ + 1, l, 1) constructed by taking one derivative and antisymmetrizing it with an index of
the operator. On the other hand, w5(n, l + n) = 0 for any n, because the n-th symmetrized
derivative constructs a descendant labeled by (∆ + n, l + n). These features are also evident
from ﬁgure 5.

Similarly we can study the block G∆,l,1 by setting the initial conditions w5(0, l) = 1 and

ws(0, l) = 0 for s = 1, 2, 3, 4. In this case we obtain

w5(1, l + 1) = − ∆12∆34l(2h + l − 3)

(76)

and ws(1, l+1) = 0 for s = 1, 2, 3, 4. Again, by looking at ﬁgure 5 one it is clear that ws(1, l) (cid:54)=
0 (for s = 1, 2, 3, 4). Therefore all the ﬁve functions Ws contribute to the construction of the
conformal block at level m > 0.

Next we want to relate the functions Wp,q to the conformal partial waves. As usual the ﬁrst

(86)

The result of these redeﬁnitions is that the Casimir equation can be written as a set of 14
coupled diﬀerential equations on the functions Wp,q, which we present in a Mathematica ﬁle.
It is then a tedious exercise to rewrite them as fourteen algebraic relations for the coeﬃcients
wp,q, as explained in the previous sections. We leave this exercise for the reader.

There are three allowed sets of initial conditions for the coeﬃcients wp,q. When the
exchanged representation is labeled by λ = (∆, l) there exist nine conformal blocks G(p,q)
∆,l
with p, q ∈ {3, 4, 5}. We can obtain each block G(p,q)
∆,l by setting as an initial condition the
function wp,q(0, j) (with the same p and q) to δj,l and all the other wp(cid:48),q(cid:48)(0, j) to zero. In
other words, for a given p, q ∈ {3, 4, 5}, the set of fourteen wp(cid:48),q(cid:48)(0, j) are deﬁned by the
initial condition

wp(cid:48),q(cid:48)(0, j) = δp(cid:48),pδq(cid:48),qδj,l .

(87)

Similarly, when the exchanged representation is λ = (∆, l, 1), we have four blocks G(p,q)
p, q ∈ {1, 2} which can be obtained by setting

∆,l,1 with

wp(cid:48),q(cid:48)(0, j) = δp(cid:48),pδq(cid:48),qδj,l .

(88)

Finally, when we exchange λ = (∆, l, 2), there exists a single block G∆,l,2 which is obtained
by setting

wp(cid:48),q(cid:48)(0, j) = δp(cid:48),0δq(cid:48),0δj,l .

(89)

We checked that these choices of initial condition actually solve the corresponding Casimir
equation at lowest order in r and therefore reproduce the correct leading OPE behavior of
the four-point function.

6 For the sake of brevity the remaining thirteen equations are appended in a Mathematica ﬁle.
7 Again the full set of relations is presented in a Mathematica ﬁle.

4 Recursion relation from analytic structure in ∆

In this section we want to use the alternative strategy of [44] in order to obtain a radial
expansion for all the conformal blocks that can appear in the conformal block decomposition
(55) for the four-point function of two vector and two scalar operators.

Following the idea of [13], in [44] a diﬀerent method to obtain the r-series expansion
of the conformal blocks is described. The main strategy is to ﬁnd recurrence relations
from the analytic structure of the conformal blocks in the conformal dimension ∆ of the
exchanged operator. In [44] the full set of poles ∆(cid:63)
for
the exchange the most generic representation λ = (∆, l1, . . . , l[h]) was obtained. Moreover, it
was explained that the residue at a pole ∆(cid:63)
A is just a linear combination of new conformal
blocks G(p(cid:48),q(cid:48))
associated to the exchange of a (null) primary descendant with weight given
by λA = (∆A, l1A, . . . , l[h]A), namely
λ ∼

It was also explained how to obtain the coeﬃcients (RA)pp(cid:48)qq(cid:48) from a direct computation.
For concreteness we write the full set of poles ∆(cid:63)
A and associated primary descendants λA in
the following table

A

where k = 1, . . . , [h] and n is an integer. To obtain λA from the data of the table it is enough
to know that ∆A = ∆(cid:63)
A + nA, and that all the liA which are not represented in the table
are left unchanged (liA = li for i (cid:54)= k). We can then reconstruct the full conformal block
summing over all the poles in ∆ and over the regular part. In radial coordinates this can be
done by writing

where

equation at leading order in large ∆, as explained in [44]. Given the knowledge of the poles
∆(cid:63)
A, the coeﬃcients RA and the conformal block at inﬁnity h∞, one can use (93) to obtain
a series expansion (in r) for the conformal block. This is usually more eﬃcient than the
method of the previous section.

4.1 Recursion relation for two external vectors and two scalars

Finally in appendix (B.2) we also ﬁnd h(∞,l,1),s(r, η).

A collection of all the deﬁnitions needed to obtain the recursion relation for the blocks

is presented in a Mathematica ﬁle included with the submission.

We would like to comment on an important feature of the recursion relation (93). At ﬁrst
sight, the reader might be puzzled by the fact that for most of the poles ∆(cid:63)
A of formula (93)
the residue looks divergent because the conformal blocks G(p(cid:48),q(cid:48))
have a pole precisely at this
value of ∆, for every A which is not of the type (II1, n) and (III, n). In the example above,
this phenomena happens in (98) for the residue of the block h(∆,l,1),s at the pole ∆ = (d− 2).
In fact, the term

λA

(RII2,1)pq h(p,q)

(d−1,l),s(r, η) ,

(100)

p,q=1

in the second line of (98), looks divergent because equation (95) tells us that h(p,q)
(∆,l),s(r, η) has
a pole at ∆ = d − 1. However, one can easily check that RII2,1, as deﬁned in (99), is such
that the combination (100) is actually ﬁnite. We expect this to happen in general so that,
in odd spacetime dimension, the only singularities of the conformal blocks in the ∆–plane
are simple poles. Moreover, this analytic structure should extend to non-integer spacetime
dimension by analytic continuation. 9

In this section, we presented the recursion relations (95) and (98) which allow us to
determine all the conformal blocks that can appear in the conformal block decomposition
(55) of the four-point function with two vector and two scalar operators.
In [38], it was
shown that the conformal blocks associated to the exchange of symmetric traceless primary
operators could be written as diﬀerential operators acting on scalar conformal blocks. This
gives an alternative way to determine h(p,q)
(∆,l),s(r, η) (see appendix C). On the other hand,
h(∆,l,1),s(r, η) must be determined using (98). Notice that in this context, the last term in
(98) is a source term that can be written in terms of (derivatives of) the scalar conformal

9In even spacetime dimension there are higher order poles in the ∆–plane.

blocks. This is a speciﬁc realization of the strategy purposed in [38, 39]. They suggested
that one should start by computing seed conformal blocks, which have the simplest external
operators that can exchange a primary in a given SO(d) irreducible representation. For
example, the seed blocks for symmetric traceless operators are scalar CBs. Then, one can
create external spin by acting with appropriate diﬀerential operators [26, 38, 39]. The seed
conformal blocks have the advantage that they are unique, in the sense that there is only
one block for the chosen external operators. This means that the recursion relations (93)
are simpler for seed CBs. This is clear in the particular example of equation (98). This is
just one equation, where the poles are proportional to the same CB with the exception of
one pole that can be determined from other seed CBs.

5 Conclusion

In the ﬁrst part of this paper we generalized the series expansion in the radial coordinate
introduced by [42] for general CBs in any spacetime dimension. To do so we deﬁned an
expansion which inherits the structure of the conformal representations exchanged in the
CB. We considered the CB as a projection of a four-point function obtained by summing
over a complete basis of a conformal representation. We organized the sum by grouping
together all the descendant operators in the same irreducible representations Y of SO(d).
Each state gives a contribution proportional to rE where E is the eigenvalue of the cylinder
hamiltonian. Therefore, we naturally obtained the CB in an expansion in radial coordinates.
We implemented the method in order to build CBs when the external operators are in the
traceless and symmetric representation, but one could generalize it for external fermionic
operators or for mixed symmetry external operators [40]. We exempliﬁed the method in
four cases, for the scalar CB, for one external vector and three scalars, two vectors and two
scalars and ﬁnally for two spin two operators and two scalars.

Another useful result of this work is to explain how to write closed form recurrence
relations for the coeﬃcients of the expansion of the functions Ws(r, η) that deﬁne the CB.
These can be obtained by following an algorithm, which we give. On the other hand there
can exist inﬁnitely many equivalent recurrence relations and it is less straightforward to ﬁnd
eﬃcient ones. We give recipes to simplify them, however it is still not clear which are the
optimal ones and how to ﬁnd them. We give examples of such simpliﬁed recurrence relations
in three cases: the scalar CB, one external vector and three scalars, and two vectors and two
scalars.

One of the nice features of these relations is that they are analytical results, therefore
they can be used to extract many interesting properties of the coeﬃcients of the expansions.
For example, the appendix A of [42] was devoted to demonstrating that the coeﬃcients of the
expansion of the scalar CB do not diverge at large ∆. Now this result can be trivially obtained
by taking the limit ∆ → ∞ of the recurrence relations and checking that the result is ﬁnite
(which we also checked for the other expansions). In the same spirit, for the scalar block one
can trivially check that for ∆12 = 0 = ∆34, all the coeﬃcients at odd level are identically
zero. For the other CBs the condition ∆12 = 0 = ∆34 is even more interesting:
for one

24

external vector and three scalars the two coupled recurrence relations completely decouple,
while in the two external vectors case, the ﬁve relations form two decoupled groups. Other
limit cases, like large l and large h, can be also approached analytically using the recurrence
relations. The reader is encouraged to play with the Mathematica ﬁles in these respects.

The algorithm to build CBs from the recurrence relations is quite eﬃcient for numerical
evaluations. However when many parameters (like h, ∆12, ∆34, ∆, l) are left unﬁxed, the
recurrence relations may become slow. This happens because every coeﬃcient at a certain
level is written in terms of a large linear combination of coeﬃcients at lower levels, which
are very non trivial rational functions of the parameters. Therefore it may take a long time
to simplify the expressions. This problem of course does not subsist when the parameters
are numbers, since the simpliﬁcations become trivial.

This method has also the feature of generating at the same time the span of all the CBs
which can be exchanged in a given four point function. In fact, to compute only one CB,
one needs to set to zero all the initial conditions correspondent to the other ones. Because of
this feature, it is not straightforward to take advantage of the philosophy of the seed blocks,
for which one should study the simplest blocks for a given exchange, and then act with
derivatives to obtain more complicated ones. In fact, the relation between the functions Ws
and the CBs is not trivial since each CB is written as a linear combination of derivatives of
Ws. Therefore the relation between the functions Ws of a given CB and the ones of its seed
block takes the form of a complicated diﬀerential equation. However, it may be useful to
analyze this problem in more detail to ﬁnd an eﬃcient strategy to include the information
about the seed blocks inside the expansion.

The importance of the seed strategy can be easily understood when we consider more
complicated four point functions. For example, to study four diﬀerent spin 2 operators one
needs to ﬁnd the expansion of 633 functions Ws which can be obtained from the same number
of coupled recurrence relations. Even if the technology to do this is ready at the present day
(due to the projectors deﬁned in [46]), this strategy is clearly going to be very ineﬃcient.
On the other hand the 633 CBs can be obtained from appropriate derivatives of just nine
seed blocks which one may derive using a combination of these and other techniques.

It would also be important to ﬁnd a way of implementing the conservation of external
operators in order to decrease the number of functions Ws to compute. In fact, the most
interesting CBs for numerical bootstrap studies are the ones of four conserved operators, in
particular vector currents or stress tensors. In these cases the number of allowed CBs reduces
in general dimensions there are only 7 CBs for four equal vector currents and
drastically:
29 for four stress tensors [47].
If one could deﬁne a single function Ws for each CB, the
resulting problem would look accessible (surely for the four vector currents case) to the
radial expansion even without any further technical development.

In this paper we also applied the alternative strategy of [44], which as well builds the
CBs from their radial expansion. The main idea of this method is to study the behavior
of CBs in the complex ∆ plane [13, 43]. From the analysis of [44] we know that the CBs
are meromorphic functions of ∆ (in odd dimensions d, but it is possible to analytically
continue the method to any non even d), and that the residues at all the poles can always be

25

written as linear combination of other CBs labeled by the position of primary descendants
which can appear in the conformal representation. This fact naturally leads to recursion
relations. All the poles and the CBs at each residue are known in general while the speciﬁc
linear combination has to be computed case by case following a systematized algorithm. The
regular part of the CBs needs also to be computed case by case and it can be thought as the
initial condition for the recursion relation.10 The only important subtlety, which was noted
in [44], is that the CBs which appear in the residues are actually divergent. This problem
was preventing the computation of new CBs using this technology. Here we checked in one
explicit case that the divergent CBs at the residue actually appear in a very special linear
combination which exactly cancels the divergent piece, giving a ﬁnite result. We believe that
this should always happen and that this method can be safely used to build any CB.

In particular in this paper we obtained all the ﬁve CBs in the scalar-vector-scalar-vector
four point function:
four of them correspond to the exchange of a symmetric and trace-
less representation, the ﬁfth is a seed block for the exchange of an operator (∆, l, 1). The
recurrence relation which determines the seed block couples to the other four CBs, but in
a linear way. Thus one can simply replace the four CBs by derivatives of the scalar CB
(which is the seed block for the exchange of a traceless and symmetric operator). This is an
explicit realization of the seed block program. Moreover this structure generalizes for any
CB since the recursion relations of [44] always relate the CBs in a linear way. Therefore in
the recurrence relations to determine any seed CB one will only need to impute derivatives
of simpler seed blocks, recursively up to the scalar CB. In addition, as discussed in [44], the
conservation of external operators can be directly incorporated in this method in order to
simplify the equations. And ﬁnally, this method allows a more eﬃcient computation of CBs
even in the case of many unﬁxed parameters (like h, ∆12, ∆34, ∆, l). In fact, at each step of
these recurrence relations all the coeﬃcients are known in a closed form, so there is no need
to simplify them.

The only downside of this method is that it can be tedious to perform all the computations
needed to ﬁnd the closed form formula for the linear combination of CBs at each pole.
Sometimes it may help to have another way to compute the CB and use it to determine
some of these coeﬃcients. In fact this is what we did in the two external vectors case, since
we already knew a simpler way to build the CBs from their radial expansion. We therefore
believe that the interplay of these two methods can be very proﬁtable in the plan of obtaining
spinning conformal blocks.

A Diﬀerential equations in Gegenbauer basis

In the main text we explain how to trade the diﬀerential equations for the functions Ws, which
come from the action of the conformal Casimir, with algebraic relations for the coeﬃcients
ws of the expansion of the functions Ws. However, we did not stress that for one diﬀerential
equation one can in principle write inﬁnite algebraic relations to which would correspond
diﬀerent “dot diagrams” like the ones depicted in ﬁgures 4(a) and 4(b). This is not surprising
since given a relation as for example (26), it is alway possible to sum to it the same relation
with shifted m and j. The result can still be used as a valid recurrence relation for the
coeﬃcients, but it would in general contain more terms and therefore it would be less eﬃcient.
The aim of this appendix is to explain the main manipulations which we used to simplify
the algebraic relation for the ws.

The ﬁrst caveat is that in general, instead of the last relation of (25), it is better to use

to express any derivative in η of order higher than one. Formula (101) comes from the usual
Gegenbauer diﬀerential equation, once we derived it n − 2 times. This is enough to obtain
formula (26) for the scalar conformal block.

For more general cases the procedure is more complicated. In fact, in the scalar case the
Casimir equation gives just the single diﬀerential equation (21), while for any other case we
obtain a system of coupled diﬀerential equations that we schematically write as PDEs = 0
for the set of functions Ws, where the label s goes from 1 to the total number of tensor
structures in the four-point function. Notice that each equation PDEs = 0 arises by collecting
the terms multiplying the tensor structure Q(s) in the Casimir equation. However, the choice
of the basis Q(s) is not unique.

For example, in the case of one external vector the Casimir equation gives rise to a system
of two coupled diﬀerential equations for the two functions W1 and W2, that we schematically
write as

PDE1(W1, W2) = 0 ,

PDE2(W1, W2) = 0 .

(102)

We could write the diﬀerential equations PDEs explicitly, but the expressions are very lengthy
and they do not provide any deep insight. We want however to stress that both PDE1 and
PDE2 can be written as a combination of the terms

(cid:8)W1, ∂ηW1, ∂ηW2, ∂2

ηW1, ∂2

ηW2, ∂3

with appropriate non zero coeﬃcients depending on r and η, and on the parameters h, ∆, l,
∆12 and ∆34. As a ﬁrst step, it is natural to try to simplify the system. To do so our criteria
was to ﬁnd new diﬀerential equations which involve less terms with high order derivatives.
For example, if we ask for which coeﬃcients a(r, η) the combination PDE1 + a(r, η)PDE2 can

be written just in terms of(cid:8)W1, ∂ηW1, ∂ηW2, ∂2

r W1
we obtain that a(r, η) = −η. Similarly, if we want to use the set

ηW1, ∂rW1, ∂2

ηW2, ∂3

ηW2, ∂r∂ηW2, ∂2

r ∂ηW2

(cid:9)

(104)

(105)

we ﬁnd the condition a(r, η) = (r2 + 1) /(2r). Therefore we obtain a simpler system of
equation by choosing

PDE1 − η PDE2 = 0 ,

2r PDE1 − (r2 + 1) PDE2 = 0 .

(106)

Applying this simpliﬁcation we obtain two coupled algebraic relations ARs for the coeﬃcients
ws. The ﬁrst of which is actually the one deﬁned in (52) with s = 1. The second one can
instead be schematically written as

AR2(m, j) ≡ 2(cid:88)

(cid:88)
((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j)∈(cid:101)Ss

(cid:101)cs((cid:98)m,(cid:98)j) ws(m +(cid:98)m, j +(cid:98)j) = 0 ,

(107)

where the coeﬃcients(cid:101)cs are in general diﬀerent from the ones of (52) and (cid:101)Ss is represented
W1 and W2 even if there are two points with maximal (cid:98)m.

in ﬁgure 6. Equation (107) can still be used to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients of the expansions of
In fact, one can for example
choose to express ws(m, j) with maximal m and lower j in terms of the other coeﬃcients.
But this is not enough, one also needs to assume that the expansion of Ws is of the form
of ﬁgure 2. Therefore, at each level m one should start by expressing w(m, j) starting from
j = l + m and decreasing j until max(0, l − m), and imposing that the coeﬃcients with
j /∈ [max(0, l − m), l + m] vanish. However, one can convince oneself that the expansion of
ﬁgure 2 implies that ﬁgure 6 is not minimal, and that there should exist a minimal relation

28

which has just a single dot with maximal (cid:98)m. A relation with this feature can actually be

obtained as follows. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne a new set of algebraic relations indexed by an integer
n,

n(cid:88)

ar(n)(m, j) =

AR2(m, j − 1 − 2k) .

(108)

k=0

When n = 0, the “dot diagram” of ar(0)(m, j), would simply be a shifted version of ﬁgure
(6). However, increasing the value of n, we found (as a result of a computation) that in the
“dot diagram” of ar(n)(m, j) two distinct shapes of points appear and disentangle one from
the other, as pictured in ﬁgure 7. In ﬁgure 7 we considered values of n up to n = 6, but
increasing n further it is possible to send the lower shape of points at arbitrary large and

negative values of(cid:98)j. When we use ar(n)(m, j) with large enough n as a recurrence relation,

we can simply forget about the lower shape of points since they are just combinations of
coeﬃcients ws(m, j) with j < 0, which are zero. Since the coeﬃcients of the higher shape
do not change by increasing n, we can just consider the relation ar(n)(m, j) for any n with
n ≥ 4 (when the two shapes are really disentangled) and set the lower shape to zero. In this

way we obtain the algebraic relation (52), which only has one dot with maximal (cid:98)m.

When we consider two external vectors more complicated structures can arise but it is

enough to use the ideas of this section to simplify the recurrence relations.

B Details on the recursion relation from the analytic

structure in ∆

This appendix is devoted to the computation of all the elements which enter formulae (95)
and (98). In the ﬁrst section we compute the coeﬃcients RA and in the second section we ﬁnd
the large ∆ behavior of the blocks. Finally, in the last section we perform the leading OPE
computation for the blocks in the natural normalization provided by the method of [44].

B.1 The residues RA

In this appendix we want to give more details on the computation of all the coeﬃcients RA
in formulas (95) and (98). We start by a complete derivation of (RI2,1)pq and (RII2,1)pq. Then
we explain how to obtain (RA)pp(cid:48)qq(cid:48) of (95) from the results of [44]. Finally we write the
coeﬃcients RA of (98), which we obtained by matching the expansion in r.

In the following we obtain from ﬁrsts principles the coeﬃcients (RI2,1)pq and (RII2,1)pq
of (96) and (99). Notice that these coeﬃcients arise from new poles which were predicted
in [44], but still not observed. These arise from (null) primary descendant states which
are in a diﬀerent representation with respect to the primaries. In particular, the primary
descendant of type I2, 1 is in the representation (∆+1, l, 1), and it is a descendant at the level
one of a primary state in the representation (∆, l). Conversely, the descendant of type II2, 1

(109)

Using the language of [44], we generate the descendant states acting with an operator DA
on primary states. These descendant states become primary (and therefore null) when the
conformal dimension ∆ of the primaries takes speciﬁc values,

|I2, 1(cid:105) ≡ DI2,1 |(∆, l); z(cid:105) ,
|II2, 1(cid:105) ≡ DII2,1 |(∆, l, 1); z, w(cid:105) ,

becomes primary when ∆ = ∆(cid:63)
becomes primary when ∆ = ∆(cid:63)

The primary states |(∆, l); z(cid:105) and |(∆, l, 1); z, w(cid:105) are contracted with polarization vectors as
follows

|(∆, l, 1); z, w(cid:105) ≡(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(∆, l, 1); µ1 ··· µl

Using the operators DA in (112) we can proceed to the computation of the coeﬃcients
RA as explained in [44]. The following computations are done in a new normalization, with
respect to the main text, which is conveniently chosen to apply the techniques introduced
in [44]. In the end of the appendix we explain how to return to the conventions used in the
main text.

Next we need to obtain the relation between the OPE coeﬃcients of the primary descendant
and the OPE coeﬃcients of the original primary. It is convenient to introduce the leading
OPE of the three point function of a vector operator O1, a scalar operator O2 and an operator
O in the representations (∆, l) and (∆, l, 1),

The coeﬃcients RA of (98) could in principle be computed using the same technology
that we used in this appendix, but we decided to ﬁnd them matching terms in the expansion
in r of the conformal blocks. This can be easily done since these coeﬃcients do not present
any matrix structure. Moreover, they are not conceptually new since they arise from null

First we replace (68) and gλ,s(r, η) = (4r)∆hλ,s(r, η) in (128), and then we keep the term
linear in ∆. We obtain ﬁve coupled ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations in the variable r for the
functions h∞,λ,s(r, η) ≡ lim∆→∞ hλ,s(r, η). We then make the ansatz for the function h∞,λ,s,

of ﬁve coupled ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations is usually very diﬃcult, in this case we can
easily obtain the full solution. This is possible since the choice of the ansatz (130) turns
the solution F t
s into polynomials of r and η that can therefore be obtained by expanding
(131) in series of r, and then solving it term by term. The choice of (130), which makes
this possible, is an educated guess inspired by the large ∆ behavior of the scalar conformal
block. The result is

Notice that the matrix F t
is independent of the SO(d) representation of the exchanged
s
operator. This is not surprising since this information only appears in the eigenvalue cλ in
terms of order O(∆0), which do not contribute at leading order at large ∆.

We can ﬁnally obtain h(p,q)

(∞,l),s(r, η) of (95), and h(∞,l,1),s(r, η) of (98), simply by taking
the appropriate initial conditions for the functions Ws, which correspond to the blocks G(p,q)

and G∆,l,1.

B.3 The OPE limit of Conformal Blocks

here we denote (cid:98)G(p,q)

In this appendix we explain how to obtain the leading behavior of the conformal blocks for
r → 0, for the exchange of a generic representation λ in the normalization used in [44], which
. To do so, we need to introduce some generic deﬁnitions. The leading
order (in x12) OPE between two operators O1 and O2, with conformal dimensions ∆1 and
∆2, and spins l1 and l2, is

As an example the structures t(q) deﬁned in (118) are of this form, where the indices of Y

We consider the four point function of operators Oi with conformal dimensions ∆i and
spin li, and repeat the reasoning of [44]. Taking the leading OPE (134) in the channels 1− 2
and 3 − 4, and writing the remaining two point function as (137), we obtain

To actually compare the two sides of equation (142) we need to expand the left hand side in
the structures Q(s) using the fact that Vi,jk, Hij and η, for small r, behave as

Va,bi ≈ za ·(cid:98)xab ,
Vi,12 ≈ −zi · I(x24) ·(cid:98)x12 ,

η ≈ −(cid:98)x12 · I(x24) ·(cid:98)x34 ,

H34 ≈ z3 · I(x34) · z4 ,

where a, b ∈ {1, 2} and i, j ∈ {3, 4}. The only new part of (142) with respect to what was
discussed in [44] is that we have to implement the contraction of the indices Y. To do so we
need to know the projector into the representation labeled by Y.

and t(2)

already discussed in [44]. Therefore, one can easily obtain(cid:98)g(p,q)

In the case of the four point function with two vector operators at the points x1 and x3
and two scalars, we know how to generate the projectors in all the exchanged representations,
therefore we can use equation (142) to obtain the leading OPE of the conformal blocks. For
the case of the symmetric and traceless exchange, formula (142) simply reduces to what was
(∆,l),s(0, η) from the deﬁnitions of
t(1)
in (118). Instead, the case of the exchange of (∆, l, 1) is new. We can implement
l
the contraction of the indices of (142) in two ways, either using the operators Dz,w, Dw,z of
(113), or using the closed form for the projector proposed in (63). Following the ﬁrst way
we would obtain

C Diﬀerential Operators Method

In this appendix we implement the method of [38] to match some of the results obtained from
the expansions in radial coordinates presented in the main text. The main idea of [38] is that
we can obtain conformal blocks for external operators with spin, by acting with diﬀerential
operators on the scalar conformal block. Schematically one can write

G(p,q)

∆,l (Pi, Zi) = D(p)

LeftD(q)

RightG∆,l(Pi) ,

(147)

Left and D(q)

where the operators D(p)
Right are explicitly deﬁned in [38] in terms of multiplication
and derivatives using the embedding vectors Pi and Zi, and by some shifts of the external
dimensions. Using formula (147) one can obtain all the blocks for the exchange of a symmetric
and traceless representation. Unfortunately, with this method it is not possible to obtain the
blocks for more complicated exchanges. However, one can pursue the philosophy of acting
with some diﬀerential operators on simple seed blocks, which exchange a representation λ
in order to obtain the most generic blocks labeled by the exchange of the same λ. This idea
was fruitfully followed in four dimensions in [36].

It is instructive to write explicitly how the diﬀerential operators look in radial coordinates.
To do so we ﬁrst express the scalar block using equation (19) and then collect the coeﬃcients
multiplying each tensor structure in the four point function according to (44). In the case of
the conformal block decomposition (30) of the four point function with one external vector,
we ﬁnd

and the functions h(∆,l) are related to the usual conformal blocks as follows g(∆,l) = (4r)∆h(∆,l)
(∆,l),s). The matrix M is introduced in order to match the normalization
(and similarly for h(p)
of the conformal blocks that we used in the main text. The operators D(p)
are deﬁned as

where h[k] means that the variable ∆12 in the function h is shifted by k, according to ∆12 →
∆12 + k. Formula (148) is in agreement with the radial expansion of section 3.1 and with
the results of [44].

Similarly, for the case of two external vectors we can write h(p,q)

h(∆,l)(r, η).
In this case we do not present the explicit action of the operators since it would be too long.
However, we deﬁne them in a Mathematica ﬁle included with the submission. It is worth
mentioning that the result matches the computation of the symmetric and traceless blocks
g(p,q)
(∆,l),s(r, η) obtained both from the r expansion and from the analytic structure in ∆.
