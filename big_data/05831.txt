Time-reversal (TR) refocusing of waves is one of fundamental principles in wave physics. Using
the TR approach, “Time-reversal mirrors” can physically create a time-reversed wave that exactly
refocus back, in space and time, to its original source regardless of the complexity of the medium
as if time were going backwards. Lately, laboratory experiments proved that this approach can
be applied not only in acoustics and electromagnetism but also in the ﬁeld of linear and nonlinear
water waves. Studying the range of validity and limitations of the TR approach may determine and
quantify its range of applicability in hydrodynamics. In this context, we report a numerical study
of hydrodynamic TR using a uni-directional numerical wave tank, implemented by the nonlinear
high-order spectral method, known to accurately model the physical processes at play, beyond
physical laboratory restrictions. The applicability of the TR approach is assessed over a variety
of hydrodynamic localized and pulsating structures’ conﬁgurations, pointing out the importance of
high-order dispersive and particularly nonlinear eﬀects in the refocusing of hydrodynamic stationary
envelope solitons and breathers. We expect that the results may motivate similar experiments in
other nonlinear dispersive media and encourage several applications with particular emphasis on the
ﬁeld of ocean engineering.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nonlinearity is a fundamental feature of hydrodynamic
evolution equations and is therefore crucial for the accu-
rate description of water waves [1, 2]. One particular and
prominent form of hydrodynamic instability of nonlinear
waves is the Benjamin-Feir instability [3]. This insta-
bility has been discussed in modeling oceanic extremes.
Indeed, the formation of extremely large and steep waves
in real seas, also known as freak or rogue waves (RWs),
has drawn signiﬁcant scientiﬁc attention in past years,
see [4–8]. In fact, the dynamics of RWs can be described
and modeled within the framework of exact solutions of
the nonlinear Sch¨odinger equation (NLS) [9–11]. In fact,
integrable weakly nonlinear evolution equations, such as
the NLS, allow to discuss the propagation characteristics
of speciﬁc and complex waves by means of exact solutions
[12, 13]. Recent laboratory as well as numerical studies
conﬁrmed the existence of hydrodynamic breathers [14–
16]. Being controllable in both time and space, breathers
are more accurate physical models to generate extreme
waves for engineering application purposes, rather than
using the ineﬃcient as well as simpliﬁed linear super-
position principle. Prominent models are for instance
the family of doubly-localized Peregrine and Akhmediev-
Peregrine breathers.

Time-reversal (TR) is another fundamental principle
in wave physics and it has been used in several con-
texts in past years, especially, for acoustic and elastic
waves [17, 18]. This TR technique, based on TR mirrors
works as the following: a given wave pulse, generated

∗ guillaume.ducrozet@ec-nantes.fr

at a source, is then measured by a set of antennas or
probes after a certain propagation in space. These sig-
nals are then time-reversed and rebroadcasted from the
same measurement locations by the TR mirrors. If TR-
invariance is valid, the initial wave pulse is expected to
focus back at the original source location, independen-
tally of the complexity of the medium.

The eﬀects of dispersion [18, 19] and nonlinearities [20]
have been experimentally studied for acoustic waves. It
has been shown that the time-reversed ﬁeld focuses back
in time and space as long as nonlinearities do not create
dissipation, i.e., as long as the propagation distance is
smaller than the shock distance.

Recently, TR has been also applied in the ﬁeld of water
waves.
It has been experimentally shown to be valid
for wave ﬁelds with very weak nonlinearity [21] and for
very steep and therefore strongly nonlinear waves [22]. In
the latter study, strongly and doubly-localized breather
solutions have been used to conduct the experiments in a
uni-directional wave ﬂume, while it has been shown that
TR accurately is valid for these RW models.

In this work, we report an extensive and detailed nu-
merical study of the eﬀects of dispersion and nonlineari-
ties on hydrodynamic TR within the framework of NLS
envelope solitons and breathers. The main goal of this
work is to accurately quantify the validity of the TR ap-
proach for water waves, based on a numerical wave tank
(NWT) [23],
implemented by the conservative higher-
order spectral method (HOS) [24, 25]. It is shown that
the TR is indeed valid for nonlinear waves for a wide
range of wave propagation distances as well as steepness
values. This proves the robustness of TR property of NLS
localized structures with respect to noise and chaos. Lim-
itations of the TR approach are also discussed in detail.

The paper is organized as follows: the ﬁrst section
presents the weakly nonlinear theory of water waves and
the TR principle. Then, the NWT conﬁguration will be
detailed as well as the method used to generate localized
structures inside this NWT. The third section is devoted
to the validity analysis of the TR for water waves in rela-
tion to nonlinearity of the wave ﬁeld as well as to disper-
sion eﬀects. Finally, the last section analyzes the prop-
erties of the physical processes, including a discussion on
the limitations of the TR method in hydrodynamics.

II. NONLINEAR WAVES AND THE

TIME-REVERSAL PRINCIPLE

In this work, we are interested in the propagation of
water waves at large scales and consequently we limit our
study to surface gravity waves. Furthermore, we assume
that the waves are evolving in deep-water, that is, we as-
sume that the ratio of water depth h to the wavelength λ
is large. For practical applications, a deep-water condi-
tion is already satisﬁed when h/λ > 1/2. Finally, we are
interested in conﬁgurations in which dissipation is negli-
gible and consequently do not consider viscous eﬀects of
any kind: solid boundaries, wave breaking, etc.

This classical set of assumptions for water waves leads
to the modeling of this physical phenomena thanks to the
nonlinear potential ﬂow theory. This has been widely
used to study several nonlinear wave phenomena such
as nonlinear wave interactions [9], RWs [26, 27] and
water-wave turbulence [28]. Numerical solutions of the
fully nonlinear problem can be complex and very time-
consuming from a numerical point of view. An alterna-
tive to overcome these constraints is to assume weak non-
linearity of the wave ﬁeld, while processes are expected
to be narrow-banded, allowing slow modulations. With
those additional hypotheses, one may use the focusing
NLS equation [9] to describe the evolution of nonlinear
narrow-banded wave trains in deep-water

while ψ(x, t) is the complex envelope of the correspond-

steepness ka (k = 2π/λ is the wave number and a stands
for the wave amplitude), the free surface elevation is then
given by

η(x, t) = Re (ψ(x, t) exp (i [kx − ωt]))

(2)

One of the most powerful feature of the NLS is that
it has been shown to be fully integrable [29], leading to
the possible use of inverse scattering transform or Dar-
boux transformations to derive exact weakly nonlinear
solutions [11, 30]. Diﬀerent and several analytic forms
of NLS solutions have been derived and shown to possi-
bly exist when the considered problem is driven by this
equation, including water waves [4, 13, 16, 31, 32].

In a general context, those solutions are expressed with
the scaled form of Eq. (1). The latter is obtained when

phasized to be appropriate models to describe oceanic

Figure 1 depicts the evolution of the three types of

wave envelopes in scaled units.

The envelope soliton has a stationary wave enve-
lope over T and represent a localized wave group
(|Ψ(X → ±∞, T → ±∞)| → 0). On the contrary,
breathers are pulsating and in both time and space
localized wave envelopes that describe the dynamics
of unstable wave trains in several nonlinear dispersive
media (|Ψ(X → ±∞, T → ±∞)| → 1), starting the
instability from the regular background in the case of
inﬁnitesimal modulation frequency. The latter represent
diﬀerent analytic possible solutions to the NLS in some

simple conﬁgurations.

For a given solution ψ(x, t) of (1), it can be easily
veriﬁed that the time-reversed complex conjugate form
ψ∗(x,−t) is also a solution. Therefore, both correspond-
ing free surface elevations η(x, t) and η(x,−t) are possible
solutions to the water wave problem within the frame-
work of the NLS. Thanks to this property, a TR mirror
can be used to create the time-reversed hydrodynamic
wave ﬁeld η(x, t) in the whole propagating medium. If
the problem has only one horizontal spatial dimension,
it appears suﬃcient to measure the wave ﬁeld at one lo-
cation η(xM , t) and rebroadcast the time-reserved signal
η(xM ,−t) from this unique point xM (mirror position)
in order to observe the solution η(x,−t) in the whole
medium and thus, to verify the TR invariance.
Within a water wave basin, the possible procedure to
verify the time-reversibility of NLS solutions is: i) gener-
ate a given NLS wave ﬁeld, ii) measure the spread waves
at a speciﬁc location, iii) time-reverse this signal and use
it to generate a new wave ﬁeld.
If time-reversibility is
valid, the wave ﬁeld measured by the probe, during the
second experiment, should correspond to pulse, gener-
ated by the wave maker’s motion of the ﬁrst experiment.
TR has been experimentally studied in a wave basin
for initial
within the framework of breathers in [22]
solutions that exhibit strongly nonlinear features.
In
fact, doubly-localized breathers up to second-order have
been accurately refocused through TR. This indicates

3

that in this conﬁguration nonlinearity and dispersive
eﬀects are indeed time-reversible and that the NLS,
taking into account its limitations, describes well the
dynamics of water waves, even in the case of strong
focusing. Consequently, such method can be applied to
hydrodynamic waves.

The purpose of the proposed study is to detail the
range of applicability of the TR method for water waves.
As stated previously, the time reversibility can be demon-
strated in the context of NLS equation. However, we re-
call that this evolution equation is only an approximation
to the fully nonlinear physics of the water wave problem.
Especially, assumptions of weak nonlinearity and narrow-
banded dynamics are stated in order to derive this set
of equations, which limits its application range [37, 38].
However, we will show that the NLS is indeed valid for a
signiﬁcant range of parameters. In this concern, the im-
portant parameters for this study are expected to be: i)
nonlinearity, characterized by the steepness of the wave
ﬁeld ka and ii) higher-order dispersive terms, appearing
to be non-negligible, when the process is broad-banded.
The eﬀects related to the dispersion can be characterized
through the propagating distance kxM .

III. NUMERICAL WAVE TANK

CONFIGURATION AND GENERATION OF

HYDRODYNAMIC LOCALIZED STRUCTURES

Following the experiments presented in [22], a numeri-
cal procedure is set to provide an extensive analysis with
respect to the applicability and limitations, related to the
use of the TR approach for nonlinear waves in a wave
basin. This section presents the numerical model as well
as the setup validation.

A. Numerical Wave Tank

The numerical validation of the TR procedure in the
context of water waves relies on an accurate description
of the wave physics at play during the wave propagation.
Primarily, it has been discussed in previous section that
possible limitations are due to high-order nonlinearities
as well as high-order dispersive terms. Consequently, the
suitable numerical model must include these physical
features in the conﬁguration of the nonlinear potential
ﬂow solver, being the typical candidate, if we exclude
the breaking of the waves.

The HOS model [24, 25] has been widely used in the
context of water waves for the study of speciﬁc nonlinear
processes such as modulation instability [16, 39], simu-
lation of RWs in irregular sea states [26] or emergence
of bimodal seas [40]. This highly nonlinear scheme al-
lows an eﬃcient and accurate solution of the water wave
problem.

This original HOS model is however limited to the
study of nonlinear waves propagating in a periodic do-
main, specifying an initial condition. The conﬁguration
is essentially diﬀerent in the context of a wave basin. This
exhibits a wave maker to generate a given wave ﬁeld, an
absorbing beach on the other side of the basin to prevent
wave reﬂections as well as reﬂection conditions on the side
walls. Consequently, speciﬁc attention has been paid to
the development of a NWT, we refer to as HOS-NWT,
that includes all those speciﬁcities. This model has been
validated with several comparisons to experiments on dif-
ferent wave ﬁelds: from regular unidirectional waves to
directional irregular sea states, see [23] for details.

In the following, the conﬁguration used for the NWT
is similar to the experiments reported in [22]. The uni-
directional wave ﬁeld will be analyzed in the conﬁgu-
ration, sketched on Figure 2 for the sake of appropri-
ate analysis dimensions. The wave maker is deﬁned as
a hinged ﬂap and the numerical absorbing beach is de-
signed so that no reﬂection occurs during the simulations.
The water depth is deﬁned as h = 1 m, the hinged loca-
tion is d = 0.8 m, while the length of the basin is set to
be Lx = 20 m.

FIG. 2. Sketch of the NWT

When using HOS-NWT, diﬀerent numerical parame-
ters have to be chosen to ensure an accurate description
of the physical phenomena at stake (essentially at wave
generation and propagation stage). These are highly de-
pendent on the wave ﬁelds of interest. In the following,
the study focus on quasi-narrow-banded sea states. We
are indeed interested in analytic solutions to NLS equa-
tions, namely the stationary envelope soliton and the
doubly localized breathers. Those are sea-states with en-
ergy concentrated around a mean wave number k, kept
ﬁxed in all presented wave ﬁelds to k = 30 rad m−1. A
convergence study allowed us to deﬁne the following nu-
merical parameters which are used throughout the whole
study:

eﬀective number of modes, that is the ones which
are accurately solved. To prevent dealiasing, com-
putations are done on Nxd = 10241 and Nzd = 161
points/modes.

• The time tolerance used in adaptative Runge-Kutta

scheme is 10−7.

B. Generation of a localized wave ﬁeld

We start the TR procedure by ﬁrst deﬁning the tempo-
ral surface wave proﬁle of the pulse to be studied η(xS, t)
at the source position (wave maker position) xS. As spec-
iﬁed earlier, diﬀerent speciﬁc NLS pulses for several wave
parameters will be investigated in this work. The choice
of the analytic envelope soliton, see Eq. (4), or doubly-
localized structures, see Eq. (5), will deﬁne the complex
envelope ψ(x, t) and the corresponding target free surface
elevation at the maximal envelope amplitude η(x = 0, t)
through Eq.
(2). This allows to deﬁne the boundary
conditions, which will then be applied to the wave maker
and therefore the wave maker’s motion through the use
of an adequate transfer function, dependent of the wave
maker’s shape. We demonstrate the validity of this pro-
cedure by means of the Peregrine solution. Figure 3 gives
an example of the free surface proﬁle η(x = 0, t) used to
deduce the wave maker’s motion. It is the case of a Pere-
grine breather with carrier wave steepness ka = 0.09 and
a carrier amplitude a = 0.003 m, evaluated at x = 0.
We used ramps at the beginning and end of the chosen
time window in order to ensure:
i) a smooth start of
the wave maker movement and ii) the periodicity of the
signal, which is decomposed on Fourier components.

ing of the problem with all degrees of nonlinearity

In the diﬀerent conﬁgurations tested, the time-window
of the target free surface elevation is kept the constant
and is speciﬁed and depicted on Figure 3. This cor-
responds to Tw ≃ 175T0, which is suﬃciently long to
prevent from any boundary eﬀects on a suﬃciently long
time window around the modulation, that occur around

≃ 110 T0, as presented in [22].

Once the ﬁrst wave ﬁeld is recorded at the speciﬁed
probe mirror location xM , we time-reverse this signal and
use it as novel wave maker’s signal for the follow-up TR
refocusing experiment. Figure 4 presents an example of
recorded signal in the case of Peregrine breather as well
as the corresponding time-reversed time-series, injected
to the wave maker for ka = 0.09 and kxM = 270. Note
that the time origin has been shifted to take into account
the propagating distance (t′ = t − xM /Cg).

It can be noticed that the wave’s amplitude is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced at xM , compared to the initial wave pro-
ﬁle, generated by the wave maker. This is expected from
weakly nonlinear theory since the modulationally unsta-
ble waves start decaying after reaching the maximal satu-
ration point, as described by the NLS. However, it can be
clearly seen that due to higher nonlinear and dispersive
eﬀects, the resulting envelope is not of symmetric nature
as expected from the symmetric NLS. It is emphasized
that these higher-order eﬀects are less relevant in the case
of stationary NLS models, such as the envelope soliton.
More details about the underlying physical processes will
be discussed in Sec. V.

C. Validation of the setup

rameters than the one used in the experiments presented
in [22]. Namely, the Peregrine breather’s carrier has a
steepness of ka = 0.09 (i.e. the amplitude was chosen to
be a = 0.003 m). The maximal amplitude ampliﬁcation
of the modulation wave train reaches a factor of three,
consequently, this structure exhibits important nonlinear
eﬀects. Therefore, the wave ﬁeld, generated by the wave
maker has a maximal amplitude of 0.009 m and a local
steepness as large as 0.27.

FIG. 5. Comparison of the Peregrine surface proﬁle as gener-
ated by the wave maker (dashed line) with the reconstructed
and refocused waves after the TR procedure (solid line). The
carrier parameters are ka = 0.09 and a = 0.003 m, while
kxM = 270.

However, as depicted in Figure 5, the TR method
allows an accurate refocusing of this localized event.
It has to be noted that the amplitude of the extreme
event is also properly recovered. This result is in perfect
agreement with the experimental results presented in [4].
A detailed comparison between initial and reproduced
wave ﬁelds allows to exhibit very similar behavior of the
method in experiments and with the NWT. Especially,
one can observe the asymmetry of the free surface proﬁle
with respect to the highest wave crest. It also appears
clearly that the main discrepancies in de-modulated
plane wave part are due to nonlinearities in the free
surface proﬁle (Stokes eﬀects), not taken into account in
the NLS formalism used here, see Eq. (2). This ﬁrst use
of the TR in the context of the NWT, associated to the
comparison to the experimental results, allows indeed a
validation of the numerical procedure.

For the validation of the numerical procedure, we re-
produce one to one the laboratory experiments, reported
in [22]. As in these experiments, the two conﬁgurations of
doubly-localized breathers are considered. In both cases,
the carrier wave number is deﬁned as k = 30 rad m−1 and
the wave probe is located at a distance xM = 9 m from
the wave maker. Note that this is a long propagating
distance with respect to the corresponding wavelength
(kxM = 270).

As a ﬁrst result, Figure 5 presents the free surface el-
evation after the TR procedure using HOS-NWT in the
case of a Peregrine breather. We use the exact same pa-

As a matter of completeness, the second test studied
experimentally in [32] is also presented. The initial wave
ﬁeld is now deﬁned as a doubly-localized structure of or-
der two. The initial and maximal wave proﬁle of the
Akhmediev-Peregrine breather is deﬁned for carrier wave
steepness ka = 0.03, evaluated at x = 0. The steepness
has to be decreased accordingly, since the initial ampli-
tude ampliﬁcation of the plane wave, injected to the wave
maker, is now of a remarkable ﬁve. This determines our
background amplitude choice of 0.001 m. Figure 6 de-
picts the NWT-HOS simulation results of TR principle
for this case.

Comparison of the second-order Akhmediev-

(dashed line) with the reconstructed and refocused waves af-
ter the TR procedure (solid line). The carrier parameters are
ka = 0.03 and a = 0.001 m, while kxM = 270.

In this conﬁguration, the original strongly modulated
wave ﬁeld is also accurately refocused thanks to the TR
method. The superposition of the initial free surface pro-
ﬁle and the one reproduced is nearly perfect. These re-
sults are once gain in agreement with the correspond-
ing experiments, providing a validation of the proposed
numerical procedure, also for this signiﬁcant amplitude
ampliﬁcation.

Then, the numerical model based on highly nonlinear
HOS method provide an accurate description of the com-
plex physics involved in the wave propagation. The non-
linearities and the high-order dispersive eﬀects are shown
to be time-reversible in those test cases. As reported in
the following section, the next step is now to make use
of the proposed procedure to study the application range
of the TR in the context of water waves with respect to
the steepness (nonlinearity) and the propagation distance
(dispersion) for an accurate TR refocusing.

the stationary envelope soliton solution, followed by the
two doubly-localized breathers of ﬁrst and second-order,
respectively.

It appears necessary to use an accuracy estimator to
evaluate the validity of the TR technique. This is based
on the free surface elevation recorded by the wave gauge
after application of TR, namely ηT R(t). In the context of
the reproduction of extreme waves in wave basins, it has
been shown in [42] that the most important parameter
to ensure the correct kinematics inside the ﬂuid domain,
also essential for example to study wave-structure inter-
actions, is the wave amplitude. Consequently, the chosen
accuracy parameter is deﬁned by

Ramp =

max (ηT R)
max (ηN LS)

,

(6)

while ηN LS denotes the analytic free surface elevation
obtained from NLS. This parameter appears appropriate
to have an accurate estimation of the quality of the TR
refocusing. As we will see in the following, discrepan-
cies will be characterized by possible change of shape or
time-shifts. Nevertheless, these discrepancies have been
always associated to a change on amplitude that is rele-
vant as an indicator of global accuracy.

Note that the maximum steepness, chosen in the dif-
ferent test models presented, is below breaking-steepness
thresholds, related to each considered solution. Indeed,
choosing large steepness values for the carrier, modeled
by breathers in particular may engender breaking, mak-
ing these wave trains are neither suitable for accurate
studies within the context of the NLS nor for the HOS-
NWT based simulations. We therefore limit this study
to the range of stability of experimental and numerical
computations.

A. Stationary envelope solitons

IV. VALIDITY OF THE TIME-REVERSAL

APPROACH

Realistic sea state conditions may exhibit conﬁgura-
tions, in which nonlinearities may become signiﬁcant [41].
Taking into account this fact as well as the chaotic nature
of ocean waves, it is consequently interesting to study the
possible limitations to the use of TR for those wave con-
ditions. This would allow to determine the limitations in
tracing back oceanic extreme events.

In this study, we reduce our attention to simple sta-
tionary as well as highly nonlinear pulsating states, as
determined by the NLS. The parameters studied are re-
duced to the wave steepness ka, which characterizes the
nonlinearity of the wave ﬁeld, as well as the maximal
propagation distance required for an accurate TR refo-
cusing kxM , that characterizes the eﬀects of dispersion,
characteristics known to restrict the NLS approach. As
simple artiﬁcial sea state conﬁgurations, we will consider

In the proposed study, we use a simple wave generation
method as reported earlier. Note that it is stated in
[43] that the wave generation method is important when
studying large steepness in the case of envelope solitons.
However, the inﬂuence of these control laws are not of
primary interest in this study and we refer to [43] for
more details.

We present here the application of the TR refocusing
approach to this conﬁguration, varying the initial steep-
ness ka and dimensionless propagating distance kxM ac-
cordingly. Figure 7 presents the accuracy estimator Ramp
as function of these two parameters.

First, as expected, it is obvious that the accuracy of
the TR method is indeed dependent on the two parame-
ters of interest in this study, allowing the quantiﬁcation
of nonlinearities as well as dispersive properties of the
considered wave ﬁeld. We observe that increased nonlin-
earity of the wave ﬁeld leads to a less accurate reproduc-
tion of the targeted wave ﬁeld. These high-order eﬀects

start to be very important from ka ≃ 0.20 and start hav-
ing a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the quality of the procedure
above this value. Furthermore, the correlation ampli-
tude factor Ramp of the considered ”sech”-wave pattern
starts to drastically reduce, when approaching the wave
breaking limit. This is in agreement with the experi-
mental results, reported in [43], namely at a steepness of
ka = 0.35 strong distortions of the NLS envelope soliton
are noticed.

At the same time, also clearly noticeable, larger prop-
agating distances also decrease the accuracy of the TR
procedure accuracy. The propagating distances studied
here are ranging from kxM = 15 up to kxM = 480,
representing indeed signiﬁcant long evolution distances.
High-order dispersive and nonlinear eﬀects may conse-
quently have indeed an inﬂuence on the propagation of
the wave ﬁeld, breaking down the time-reversibility in
the proposed conﬁguration.

In order to reﬁne the analysis of the origin of the
discrepancies observed between initial and reconstructed
free surface elevation, we present the simulation results,
obtained for the steepness ka = 0.30, an amplitude of a =
0.01 m and propagating distance kxM = 330. The cor-
responding amplitude ratio in this case is Ramp = 0.68,
indicating low accuracy of the TR procedure with this
choice of parameter. Figure 8 shows the corresponding
results after the ﬁrst propagation in the NWT.

We can observe that the initial envelope soliton is start-
ing to disintegrate during its propagation and its dynam-
ics is not in agreement with NLS predictions. Again, this
is in agreement with [43]. The initial ”sech”-shaped solu-
tion starts to ﬁssion into smaller amplitude solitons [44].
Figure 9 depicts the comparison of the initial enve-
lope soliton and the free surface elevation, reconstructed
through TR.

We notice that neither the initial amplitude nor the
initial location could be reconstructed. The initial de-
terioration of the envelope after the ﬁrst propagation is
exacerbated by the TR after the second evolution. With
other words, the NLS and its physical properties are no
longer valid for the choice of envelope soliton parameters.
In fact, signiﬁcant higher-order eﬀects in terms of nonlin-
earities and dispersion are thus associated to the reduced
accuracy. Those features will be studied in more details
with the analysis of doubly-localized breathers.

B. Doubly-localized breathers

The study of

limitations of the TR approach for
breathers is obviously more challenging, compared to the
previous stationary case. The ﬁrst- and second-order
doubly-localized breathers have the property to have an
inﬁnite modulation period, exhibiting a strong variation
of wave envelope and therefore of spectra as well. Detect-
ing the limitations of applicability of the TR procedure
may be transferred to assigning limitations with respect
to the reconstruction of extreme event in the ocean within
the framework of integrable evolution equations.

As already mentioned earlier, the accuracy of the NLS
and applicability of the TR technique is closely linked

to the initial steepness ka of the carrier. A similar de-
pendence to the propagating distance kxM can be also
expected.

1. Peregrine

We propose here some complements to Figure 5, which
depicted a result of the TR method for a given steep-
ness ka = 0.09 and propagating distance kxM = 270
in the case of a Peregrine breather. Figure 10 presents
the accuracy of the refocusing after the TR in terms of
amplitude of the extreme wave (Ramp). The parame-
ters of interest are varied in a range kxM ∈ [15; 480] and
ka ∈ [0.02; 0.12]. Reminding that the theoretical ampliﬁ-
cation of plane wave for a Peregrine breather is of three,
this choice of steepnesses covers the whole range of ex-
istence of such localized structures, below the breaking
threshold, experimentally determined of being at a steep-
ness value of about 0.12 [45].

and propagating distance kxM .

It is also conﬁrmed in this case that the accuracy of
the approach is improved, when the steepness is lower. In
fact, we can ensure an accurate validity of TR refocusing
for the whole range of dimensionless distance kxM , for
steepness values below ka < 0.08. Here, we also empha-
size a slight decrease of accuracy in the latter range for
small propagation distances kxM < 100 − 150.
Note that Figure 10 allows to extract the accuracy of
laboratory breather TR experiments, as described in [22].
Indeed, for the chosen propagating distance kxM = 270
the TR for the Peregrine breather with good exactitude
applies up to a steepness ka ≃ 0.10 (consistent with the
successful experiments in [22] conducted for ka = 0.09).
We recall that the local steepness of the largest wave in
the group is indeed very large and can be roughly esti-
mated of being three time the carrier steepness, that is of

8

approximately 3 ka ≃ 0.30. Taking into account the the-
oretical limitations of the NLS, as well as the laboratory
or numerical noise, always present in the experiment, the
validity of TR approach for this range of parameters is
remarkable.

As stated previously, beyond ka > 0.08, a good accu-
racy of TR refocusing can still noticed for some values of
steepness and dimensionless propagation distance. How-
ever, this validity range is not as obvious. This will be
studied in more details in Sec. V.

2. Akhmediev-Peregrine

In the case of second-order doubly-localized breather,
Figure 6 already provided an example of accurate TR
refocusing for ka = 0.03 and kxM = 270. Figure 10
extends this study and presents a more general accu-
racy diagram with respect to the parameter Ramp, as
function of initial steepness ka and propagating distance
kxM , as in the previous case. The range of parameters
is kxM ∈ [15; 480] and ka ∈ [0.01; 0.072]. We have to
recall that for this speciﬁc solution, the theoretical am-
pliﬁcation of plane wave is of ﬁve. Again, the range of
steepness values has been chosen to prevent breaking of
the highest ampliﬁed waves.

FIG. 11. Accuracy diagram of the TR for the doubly-localized
Akhmediev-Peregrine breather of order two Ramp as function
of initial steepness ka and propagating distance kxM .

The dependence of Ramp with respect to the two
parameters is very similar to the case of the Peregrine
breather. That is to say, the accuracy of the TR approach
is reduced when the steepness is increased. At the same
time, the accuracy is also reduced at large propagating
distances, and slightly altered for kxM < 100 − 150.
Figure 10 may be used to state that for the whole range
of propagating distances studied, the TR method allows
correct refocusing up to ka ≃ 0.05. For the the same
example than in previous section (i.e. kxM < 270), the

TR method allows correct refocusing up to ka ≃ 0.06,
that is at a local steepness in the modulation 5 ka ≃ 0.30.
As a general conclusion of the previous test-cases, it
has been shown that the TR method is eﬃcient on a large
range of steepnesses and propagating distances. Diﬀer-
ent kinds of wave envelope patterns have demonstrated a
similar behavior. However, the time-reversibility of water
waves fails for large steepness or very large propagating
distances. TR procedure will allow an accurate refocus-
ing when the local steepness of the localized structures do
not exceed a general value of about ka ≃ 0.25. Neverthe-
less, we are optimistic in possible applications of TR for
ocean waves, considering the fact that ocean waves have
the property to present reduced steepness values most of
the time.

More physical insights with respect to the TR approach

will be provided in the next section.

V. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE

HOS-NWT SIMULATIONS

This section is devoted to the analysis of the limitations
of the TR method, as reported in the previous section.
For the sake of brevity, we focus on one particular case,
namely the Peregrine breather for the steepness parame-
ter ka = 0.09, propagating forth and back for kxM = 270.
We provide a rigorous analysis of the possible inﬂuence
of the propagating distance, and then of the steepness.
Note that essentially similar results are obtained in the
case of Akhmediev-Peregrine breather.

A.

Inﬂuence of propagating distance kxM

As already explained previously, one source of discrep-
ancies is the fact that high-order dispersion eﬀects, which
are not taken into account in the NLS framework, may
be not time-reversible. This will inﬂuence the way the
breather will propagate and consequently it is awaited
that the eﬀects will become increasingly signiﬁcant with
the increase of the propagating distance. This is the
probable origin of the behavior observed in Figs. 10 &
11 at large distances of evolution.

Note that the time scale of Benjamin-Feir (BF) insta-

bility is determined by tBF = O(cid:18) T

(ka)2(cid:19) with T = 2π/ω

the carrier wave period. The corresponding length scale
of this modulation instability is kxBF = kCgtBF =

(ka)2(cid:19).

It is known that this BF instability is at

O(cid:18) 1
the origin of the possible existence of localized structures
such as breathers [11]. In the present case 1/(ka)2 ≃ 125
and consequently the propagating distances studied are
in the range of modulation instability processes’ scale.
This also indicates that there is indeed a strong link be-
tween the propagating distance kxM and the steepness

9

of the considered wave ﬁeld ka.
In complement, Fig-
ure 12 presents for the previous accuracy diagram iso-
lines corresponding to this BF instability in the range
kxBF ∈ [1; 2].

breather. Dashed lines are iso-lines in terms of the modu-
lation instability process.

This instability appears consequently as a major point
in the understanding of the limitations inherent to the
TR method. In the case of a Peregrine breather, when
propagating distance is larger than about 1.8 to 2 times
the length scale of BF instability, the applicability of the
TR method starts to fade. This can be related to the
scale of validity of the NLS equation, which is also known
to be related to this BF scale and a priori valid up to
kxBF . At ﬁrst, it appears interesting to have a look to
the probe signal, recorded after the ﬁrst propagation in
xM . Figure 13 presents these signals in the case of a
Peregrine breather for ka = 0.09 for diﬀerent distances
kxM ∈ {60; 165; 375; 480}.
In addition to those time signals, numerical simula-
tions enable a general overview of the wave ﬁeld evolu-
tion. Figure 14 presents a full space-time depiction of
the propagation inside the wave basin. The variables
are changed to NLS scaled variables (X = √2k2ax and
(t − x/Cg)) as a matter of comparison to
T = −
analytic solution. We remind that an absorbing zone is
present to prevent from wave reﬂections on the end wall
in the HOS-NWT simulations present at large distances
X. This appears clearly on Figure 14 at X > 4.

The demodulation of the initial

localized structure
with respect to the propagating distance is clearly seen
during its evolution. However, it is also worth to note
that the solution does not tend to the plane wave solution
after a long time/distance propagation for this choice of
carrier parameters, as expected from NLS theory. Note
that it has been veriﬁed that this is not related to the
ﬁnite extent in time of the generated wave train, also in

variables. Comparison of analytic solution (left) and HOS-
NWT numerical simulation (right)

the case of long distance propagation, that inﬂuences the
shape of the measured wave pattern, see Figure 13 & 14.
At the same time, a asymmetry of the temporal wave
probe signal can also be observed after the ﬁrst propa-
gation. Indeed, the NLS equation predicts a symmetric
demodulation with respect to time, at ﬁxed spatial loca-
tion, which appears to be erroneous when nonlinearities
are important. This fact is well-known and has already
been pointed out in diﬀerent studies. It has been shown
that higher-order NLS equation, also referred to as the
Dysthe equation, enables a non-symmetric prediction of
the envelope evolution [16, 46–48], when the steepness
of the carrier and the amplitude ampliﬁcation become
substantial.

Nevertheless, as seen previously in Figure 5, the no-
ticed and expected asymmetry does not inﬂuence the TR
invariance. Figure 15 depicts the space and time evolu-
tion of the Peregrine wave ﬁeld during the ﬁrst propaga-

10

tion as well as for the TR wave refocusing. The case of
the Peregrine breather for ka = 0.09 and the propagating
distance of kxM = 270 is adopted here. This corresponds
to a scaled distance X ≃ 2.1 depicted on the ﬁgure.

FIG. 15. Space and time evolution of Peregrine breather for
ka = 0.09 and kxM = 270 (dash-dotted line) in the NWT.
(Left) Demodulation (right) TR refocusing.

The time-reversibility is clearly conﬁrmed during the
whole HOS-NWT computation, throughout the whole
spatial domain. Again, this conﬁrms the accurate re-
focusing presented in Figure 5 and in the experiments
in [22]. The inﬂuence of the propagating distance is
now studied on the previous test-cases by gradually in-
creasing the values of kxM . Figure 16 shows the ﬁ-
nal refocusing results of the complete TR procedure for
kxM ∈ {60; 165; 270; 375; 480} at a ﬁxed steepness of
ka = 0.09.
We can observe in this latter ﬁgure that the inﬂuence
of the propagating distance on the reconstruction is
quite complex. For relative small propagating distances
(kxM < 100), the global shape of the localized structure
is correct but is associated to a reduced amplitude at
the location of the extreme wave. Then, for a signiﬁcant
range for kxM ∈ [100; 350], the TR procedure is very
accurate in the refocusing of the localized structure
of interest. The inﬂuence of the propagating distance
is then to induce an increasing but still very small
phase-shift between the refocused solution and the
original one. Finally, for very large evolution distances,
starting from kxM ≃ 375, the slight phase-shift after
TR is associated to an ineﬀective refocusing. This leads
to a complex wave ﬁeld distortion and wave proﬁle that
signiﬁcantly deviate from the initial doubly-localized
structure. As seen in Figure 16, the eﬀect is more
pronounced when the distance is enlarged.

Also, the origin of this distortion is not straight-
forward to explain.
It is reminded here that two pro-
cesses of wave generation and propagation have to be
successively conducted in order to obtain the ﬁnal TR
result. The ﬁrst propagation detailed previously makes
appear some high-order eﬀects, that may not be time-
reversible. The same phenomena are at play during the
second stage of TR refocusing, while the ﬁnal phase-shift
or change of observed envelope shape is a kind of foot-
print with respect to the existence of non-reversible ef-
fects, related to those high-order nonlinearities together

with the high-order dispersive eﬀects. The ﬁrst inﬂu-
ence of the propagation distance is the increase of the
phase-shift after the use of the TR method. This reduces
the accuracy of the refocusing at large distances. Then,
those eﬀects are obviously more enhanced at even larger
propagation distances and lead to the failure of the TR
procedure. As stated previously, we can evaluate that
the length-scale of this limitation of applicability is asso-
ciated to the modulation instability space-scale.

Finally, we would like to address the unexpected valid-
ity of the TR approach in all temporal signals at smaller
propagating distances (kxM < 150), as can be observed
in Figure 12, Figure 13 for kxM = 60 or Figure 16 after
TR (top ﬁgure)). It is known that during the generation
of waves by a wave maker, parasitic second-order free
waves are generated at the same time than the speciﬁed
wave ﬁeld [49]. As a ﬁrst approximation, if we consider
the waves to be regular, this parasitic wave ﬁeld are reg-
ular free waves with a pulsation ω2 = 2ω. Those waves
will propagate at a velocity which is half the velocity of
the corresponding waves we are interested to generate.

Thus, it is possible to estimate, when these waves will
reach the probe position of interest at t2 = xM /Cg2 =
2
. We recall that ﬁgures presenting probe signals are

xM
Cg

already time-shifted with tshift = xM /Cg, in this time
reference frame parasitic second-order free waves, gener-
ated by the wave maker, will reach the probe at a time
t′
2 = xM /Cg. For the cases presented in Figs. 13 &
Figure 16 for kxM = 60, this corresponds to t′

2 ≃ 7s.

Indeed, the unexpected identiﬁed discrepancies in the
the surface wave proﬁle at small propagation distances
can be explained by the generation of those parasitic free
waves during the generation of the considered localized
structure. These waves appearing in all cases after the
breather with a delay t′
2nd. Thus, parasitic waves is at
the origin of the reduced accuracy at relative small prop-
agating distances kxM < [100; 150] as reported from Fig-
ure 10. Indeed, in this range of distance, the parasitic
free waves are recorded after the ﬁrst propagation for the
corresponding propagating time is t′
2 < [12; 17] s. Conse-
quently, during the refocusing of the waves, these are gen-
erated again and interfere with the localized structure,
reducing the corresponding accuracy as consequence. It
has to be noted that it is possible to control the genera-
tion of the parasitic waves, produced by the wave maker
as explained in [49]. The wave maker’s motion can then
be modiﬁed in order to prevent the generation of those
waves. This approach may be used to possibly increase
the accuracy of the TR method.

FIG. 16. Comparison of the Peregrine surface proﬁle at max-
imal compression, as initially generated with respect to the
NLS theory (dashed line) and after TR refocusing (solid line),
for ka = 0.09 and kxM ∈ {60; 165; 270; 375; 480}.

This part focuses on the inﬂuence of the nonlinear-
ity on the TR procedure. As observed previously, the
Peregrine solution imposed at the wave maker location
does not tend to the plane wave solution after a long

time/distance propagation, as expected from NLS, for
signiﬁcant carrier steepness values.

The previous section presented the inﬂuence of the
propagation distance kxM on a TR refocusing accuracy
at a ﬁxed steepness ka. We will now ﬁx the mirror loca-
tion and vary the steepness values accordingly. Indeed,
we recall that the modulation instability, which drives the
evolution of the breather solution, acts on a spatial scale

being kxBF = O(cid:0)1/(ka)2(cid:1). Figure 17 presents the probe
signals after ﬁrst propagation of a Peregrine breather at a
ﬁxed distance kxM = 270 for diﬀerent initial steepnesses
in the range ka ∈ {0.03; 0.07; 0.10; 0.12}.

FIG. 17. Probe signal measured after the propagation of
Peregrine breather for kxM = 270 for diﬀerent steepness
ka ∈ {0.03; 0.07; 0.10; 0.12}.

As expected and shown, the relative propagating dis-
tance is diﬀerent with respect to the breather demodula-
tion, evolving on the time scale 1/(ka)2. Consequently,
the amplitude decrease of the initial localized structure
is highly dependent on this initial steepness [45]. At low
steepness, the ﬁxed propagation distance kxM appears as
very small with respect to the modulation distance: the
demodulation is less signiﬁcant and it is expected that the
refocusing is more accurate. On the contrary, when the
steepness is larger, this chosen distance appears becom-
ing large with respect to modulation instability distance.
As consequence, and due to signiﬁcance of the nonlin-
ear processes, the solution can appear as highly complex
since those high-order eﬀects prevent from recovering the
plane wave solution. For details, we refer to Figure 18
that presents the full space-time plane view of the prop-
agation within the NWT for the steepest case ka = 0.12,
while the variables are changed to NLS scaled variables
as a matter of comparison to the scaled analytic solution.

demodulation, as matter of deviation from the constant
background, is clearly perceived. An increasing steepness
leads as expected to a more complex wave pattern at a
ﬁxed location of breather evolution. At the same time,
the latter feature is associated to an initial breather mod-
ulation which is also quite diﬀerent when the steepness
is changed. As an example, Figure 19 presents the re-
sults obtained after TR refocusing at ﬁxed location of
kxM = 270, as in the previous case, while varying steep-
ness values, ranging ka ∈ {0.03; 0.07; 0.10; 0.12}.
It can be noticed that looking at a ﬁxed time frame du-
ration, when the steepness is lower, the initial breather
appears indeed to be wider. The nonlinearity increases
the focusing intensity of the initial localized structure by
decreasing the breather’s lifetime [45]. The free surface
proﬁle with respect to the TR refocusing is almost iden-
tical to the analytic solution, when the steepness is lower
than ka ≃ 0.10. The increase of the steepness is associ-
ated to an increase of deviation in terms of phase-shifts
too. This is similar to what has been observed previ-
ously in the dependence study with respect to kxM . The
general behavior of the accuracy with respect to this pa-
rameter observed in Figure 10 is consequently clear.

However, it is important to note that at the largest
steepness, the wave ﬁeld after TR is completely diﬀerent
from the original one. The breather initial structure is
completely distorted after the ﬁrst propagation as seen
in Figure 17 and is not refocused during the second prop-
agation after TR. When the considered breather exhibits
high nonlinearities, the wave ﬁeld does not tend to the
plane wave solution: successive highly nonlinear groups
are created during the propagation. This feature is as-
sociated to both high-order dispersive eﬀects as well as
high-order nonlinearities. These are at play during both
propagations and they are shown to prevent from time-
reversibility and consequently limit the application range
of the TR technique.

Figure 20 shows the space-time view of the TR pro-
cedure for the case ka = 0.12 and kxM = 480. The
corresponding scaled propagating distance X ≃ 5.0 is
depicted on the ﬁgure.
Clearly, the TR technique is failing and is not valid
in this conﬁguration and it is seen that the breaking
of time-reversibility of the phenomena studied appears

As a conclusion, the refocusing of extreme waves with
TR exhibits some limitations. The main parameters in
this concern are the nonlinearity of the considered wave
ﬁeld as well as the considered propagating distance. Nev-
ertheless, as seen in Figs. 10 & 11, the applicability
of process is valid for wide range of realistic parameter

VI. CONCLUSION

To conclude, we reported a detailed numerical study
on the applicability of TR mirrors to water waves. An
highly nonlinear numerical model based on HOS method
has been set-up to reproduce the complete physical con-
ﬁguration of wave generation in a uni-directional NWT:
generation of waves by means of a wave maker, absorp-
tion of reﬂecting waves through a beach, etc. The cor-
responding HOS-NWT has been validated with experi-
mental results presented in [22]. This numerical set-up
enables us to successfully apply the TR method to dif-
ferent analytic solutions of the NLS, namely the station-
ary envelope soliton and doubly-localized Peregrine-type
breathers of ﬁrst- and second-order.

The applicability of the TR procedure has been as-
sessed over a wide range of propagating distances kxM
and initial wave steepness ka, beyond laboratory limi-
tations. Focusing our attention to pulsating solutions
(breathers), the study has demonstrated that the TR
procedure will allow an accurate TR refocusing of the
wave ﬁeld at a given propagating distance, when the lo-
cal steepness of the localized structures does not exceed
a given threshold with respect to the propagation dis-
tances. We identiﬁed that an accurate TR refocusing is
achieved for kxM ≃ 270 and a corresponding local steep-
ness up to ka ≃ 0.30. Changing the propagating distance
will obviously induce a diﬀerent threshold.
At the same time, the refocusing of extreme waves
with respect to TR exhibits some limitations. The time-
reversibility of water waves propagation appears to be
improper for large steepness and large propagating dis-
tances, particularly within the framework of exact so-
lutions of the NLS. In this case, the eﬀective diﬀerences
between analytic solutions and the fully nonlinear results
is attributed to the existing hypotheses of NLS formal-
ism, assuming a narrow-banded and weak nonlinear pro-
cess. These are not fully satisﬁed during the wave prop-
agation, when all higher-order dispersive and nonlinear
eﬀects are taken into account. The applicability of the

14

method is consequently driven by those two parameters,
namely kxM and ka. The present study has shown these
latter two parameters are closely linked in describing the
limitations of the TR technique with respect to the mod-
ulation instability length scales in the case of breathers.
Namely, the applicability of the TR method is limited
to large distances as well as the degree of nonlinearity of
the wave ﬁeld and dependent on the domain of validity
of the NLS equation.

Nevertheless, the applicability of the TR to nonlinear
waves for the quantiﬁed applicability range is quite re-
markable, taking into account the laboratory as well as
numerical noise and dissipation eﬀects, always present,
when performing numerical and laboratory tests. Fur-
thermore, we emphasize the importance of this study
with respect to the robustness of the TR technique to

chaotic motions of the water wave ﬁeld, which is known
to arise in the context of modulation instability [50, 51].
Finally, we emphasize that future interdisciplinary
work may be motivated from these results.
It is well-
known that the NLS describes the propagation of wave
in wide range of nonlinear dispersive media [5, 7, 8, 52].
Furthermore, the reproduction of RWs in wave basins is
of signiﬁcant interest in ocean engineering and has been
shown to be very complicated with classical methods [42].
The idea is to reconstruct oceanic extreme wave, such as
the New Year Wave, often used as a dedicated model for
RWs in ocean [53]. It is also important to address multi-
directionality and irregular wave conditions in order to
accurately assert the validity and limitation of the TR
in these conditions. Work with respect to these latter
aspects has started.
