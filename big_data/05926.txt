Abstract

Terahertz properties of mercury telluride (HgTe) ﬁlms with critical thickness are presented and

discussed. The density of the charge carriers is controlled using contact-free optical doping by

visible light. In the magneto-optical response of HgTe the contribution of two types of carriers

(electrons and holes) can be identiﬁed. The density of the electrons can be modiﬁed by light

illumination by more than one order of magnitude. As the hole density is roughly illumination-

independent, the terahertz response of the illuminated samples becomes purely electronic. In some

cases, light illumination may switch the qualitative electrodynamic response from hole-like to the

electron-like. The cyclotron mass of the electrons could be extracted from the data and shows a

square root dependence upon the charge concentration in the broad range of parameters. This can

be interpreted as a clear proof of a linear dispersion relations, i.e. Dirac-type charge carriers.

INTRODUCTION

Physical properties of relativistic Dirac states1,2 have attracted much interest recently, as

they exhibit a number of unusual and nontrivial electrodynamic properties. These eﬀects

arise from linear dispersion of the charge carries known as Dirac cone. Within a Dirac cone

the cyclotron eﬀective mass of the charge carriers strongly depends upon the position of

the Fermi level (as controlled by the charge density) and vanishes at the center of the cone.

Unusual electrodynamics at the interface between classical and quantum physics is expected

as, e.g., a universal Faraday eﬀect or an anomalous Kerr rotation3–6.

Among various materials the system HgTe is outstanding as it provides a universal tool to

investigate several complementary eﬀects within the same composition. Bulk HgTe is a zero-

gap semiconductor due to the degeneracy of the two hole bands at the gamma point. The

energy gap is ﬁnite for thin strained ﬁlms, which leads to a freezing out of the bulk carriers

at low temperatures. Therefore, for strained bulk samples the pure two-dimensional (2D)

character of electrons can be expected, which allows to search for unusual electrodynamics

as predicted by theory of topological insulators. In static transport experiments, a strained

HgTe layer exhibits a quantum Hall eﬀect (QHE)7, yielding direct evidence that the charge

carriers in these layers are conﬁned to the topological two-dimensional (2D) surface states

of the material.

The bulk HgTe is characterised by an inverted band structure. This means that the Γ6

band (which in conventional semiconductors is a conduction band) lays below the Γ8 bands

(which are normally the light- and heavy-holes bands).

In such a case the Γ6 band is a

completely ﬁlled valence band, the heavy-holes subband of Γ8 is a valence band and the

light-holes subband of Γ8 is the conduction band. As the light- and heavy-holes bands are

degenerate at the center of the Brillouin zone, HgTe is a zero-gap semiconductor. As the

sample thickness is decreased, the Γ6 band rises in the energy and at the critical thickness

of 6.3 nm passes over the Γ8 bands. At smaller thicknesses, Γ6 band is located above the Γ8

bands and HgTe becomes a ”conventional” semiconductor with the non-zero gap. Exactly

at the critical thickness of 6.3 nm, when the Γ6 and the light holes from the Γ8 bands are

touching each other, they form a Dirac cone. Therefore, the Dirac-like dispersion is a bulk

band-structure eﬀect in HgTe ﬁlms with critical thickness8.

Magneto-optical experiments in semiconductor ﬁlms provide a well-established tool to

2

investigate the charge dynamics in external magnetic ﬁelds9. Earlier this technique was suc-

cessfully applied to investigate the complicated band structure in HgTe single crystals. More

recently, the magneto-optics especially in the terahertz range have been utilized to study the

two- and three-dimensional conducting states in graphene, Bi2Se3 and HgTe10–12. Compared

to transport methods, optical measurements have the advantages of being contact-free and

of directly accessing the eﬀective mass via the cyclotron resonance. Both the presence of

contacts and the patterning could lead to substantial changes of carrier concentration and

of the position of the Fermi level. In the case of topological insulators these are very crucial

parameters as the most interesting phenomena are expected in the vicinity of the Dirac

point. The ability to observe the cyclotron resonance is another advantage of the magneto-

optical technique. The cyclotron mass of the charge carriers mc can be determined from the

resonance frequency ωc via mc = eB/ωc and it is directly connected to the band structure

near the Fermi level. Here e is the electron charge and B is the external magnetic ﬁeld.

In experiments on the electrodynamics of topological insulators, the control of the charge

density is very important. Such parameter is necessary to shift the Fermi level between

electron- and hole-conduction within the Dirac cone. A classical tool to achieve this goal

to use a transparent gate electrode to change the charge concentration. Recently, it has

been demonstrated that a gated topological insulator may eﬀectively be used to control the

intensity and polarization of the terahertz radiation at room temperature13.

Here we concentrate on an alternative route to modify the charge density in topological

insulators: light illumination (Figure 1). This method is well established in HgTe semicon-

ductors with both parabolic and linear dispersions14–17 and is based on speciﬁc properties of

the dispersion relations in this material. At low temperatures the channel of recombination

of the photoinduced electrons is forbidden by the momentum conservation. The light illu-

mination has several advantages compared to the gate method: the surface of the sample

remains clear and the charges are distributed more homogeneously along the surface and in

the bulk.

reveal a critical value for which the dispersion relations of electrons form a Dirac cone18,19.

An important feature of the HgTe samples is the ability to tune the charge carriers density

via induced photoconductivity. The visible light illumination causes the electron density to

increase. At low temperatures such additional charge carriers are sustained for the long

time period (of the orders of weeks) and the temperature cycling up to room temperatures

is needed in order to relax these carriers back to their impurities centers. Experimentally,

the dark cooled sample has the one-way possibility to increase the charge concentration via

illumination. In our setup this was achieved by means of green light LED mounted behind

the nontransparent windows made of black paper (which is transparent for the terahertz

radiation and opaque for infrared and visible light). The amount of additional charge carriers

brought into the conduction band is controlled by the illumination time.

II. TERAHERTZ SPECTROSCOPY OF CYCLOTRON RESONANCE

Spectroscopic experiments in the terahertz frequency range (3 cm−1 < ν < 30 cm−1)

have been carried out in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer arrangement20 which allows mea-

surements of the amplitude and the phase shift in a geometry with controlled polarization

of radiation. Theoretical transmittance curves21 for various geometries were calculated from

the susceptibilities using Fresnel optical equations for the complex transmission coeﬃcient

and within the Berreman formalism22.

The main results shown in this paper were obtained in the constant-frequency measure-

ment mode.

In such case the frequency of the terahertz radiation is ﬁxed and both the

transmission amplitude and the phase shift of the radiation passing through the sample is

measured as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld. With respect to the polarization of the radia-

tion there are two main geometries which were used in our work. (In both cases a wire-grid

polarizer was placed in front of the sample producing linearly polarized incidence wave.)

In one case another wire-grid polarizer placed behind the sample was oriented parallel to

the incident polarization. We denote this arrangement as parallel polarizers geometry. In

the other case the second polarizer was oriented at 90◦ with respect to the ﬁrst one. This

layout is called crossed polarizers geometry. Measuring the amplitude and the phase shift of

the transmitted radiation in two geometries corresponds to full determination of the trans-

mission matrix of the sample21. It should be noted that for the case of trivial sample like

isotropic dielectric only signal in the parallel geometry is expected. Nonzero signal in the

crossed geometry is indicative of some sort of polarization rotation or appearance of nonzero

ellipticity after passing through the sample.

Typical measured data of HgTe ﬁlms in parallel and crossed geometries are shown in

Fig. 2. The transmission amplitude in the parallel geometry is shown in the lower left panel

(b). Two distinct symmetrical minima are clearly seen at low ﬁelds. They correspond to

the cyclotron resonance on free charge carriers in HgTe ﬁlm. The minima at 21 cm−1 are

located at higher ﬁelds than the minima at 11.5 cm−1, which is in accordance with the
linear dependence of cyclotron resonance upon magnetic ﬁeld: Ωc ∝ B. For the case of
charge carriers with Dirac-like dispersion a nontrivial dependence of cyclotron resonance
could be expected: Ωc ∝ √B. However this case is realized only at high magnetic ﬁelds,

when only few Landau levels are ﬁlled and the transitions between the Landau levels are

FIG. 2: Magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the transmission through 6.3 nm thin HgTe sample #1

after 45 seconds illumination time in the parallel polarizers geometry (a), (b) and in the crossed

polarizers geometry (c), (d). The upper panels (a) and (c) show the phase shift measured as the

displacement of the movable mirror of the spectrometer, the lower panels (b) and (d) show the

transmission amplitude through the sample. The inset (e) demonstrates the frequency dependence

of the transmission in zero external magnetic ﬁeld. Green open circles are experimental data at

the text.

observed separately. In the present case several transitions between the Landau levels are
overlapping, which leads to a recovery of the classical behaviour with Ωc ∝ B.

The lower right panel of Fig. 2 demonstrates the transmission amplitude in the crossed

polarizers geometry. The signal is zero without magnetic ﬁeld, rises rapidly in low ﬁelds

reaching a maximum value and decreases upon further increase of magnetic ﬁeld. The

emergence of the nonzero crossed signal is the manifestation of the ac-Hall eﬀect. Detailed

analysis of the data including the phase shift shows that both the rotation of the polarization

and the nonzero ellipticity of the radiation after passing through the sample are present in

6

HgTe. For a rather clean sample where the relaxation rate of charge carriers is lower than

the cyclotron frequency, 1/τ < Ωc, the maximum in the crossed transmission signal also

correspond to the position of the cyclotron resonance.

Upper panels of Fig. 2 show magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the phase shift of the radia-

tion after passing though the sample. The upper left panel (a) corresponds to the parallel

polarizers geometry and the upper right panel (c) to the crossed polarizers geometry. The

phase shift is represented as a geometrical shift of the mirror of the spectrometer needed to

compensate for the phase shift caused by the sample. This value corresponds to the change

in the optical thickness of the sample. The phase shift in radians is then ∆ϕ = 2π∆l/λ,

where λ is the wavelength of the radiation. Whereas the experimental data in the parallel

geometry in the panel (a) show only relatively small changes, the data in the panel (c) for the

crossed geometry reveal an abrupt jump at zero magnetic ﬁeld. This is due to the fact that

the crossed signal is changing sign when the magnetic ﬁeld sweeps from positive to negative

values, which corresponds to the change in phase of exactly π, or the half wavelength λ/2

as in Fig. 2(c).

The inset (e) in Fig. 2 demonstrates typical spectra in the parallel polarizers geometry

in zero magnetic ﬁeld. The deep oscillations are caused by a Fabry-P´erot-like multiple

reﬂections within the transparent substrate, which in the particular case was 0.387 mm thick

undoped GaAs. The values of the maxima in transmission are close to unity demonstrating

high transparency of the HgTe ﬁlm. The decrease of their amplitude towards low frequencies

is in accordance with the Drude-like behaviour of the charge carriers, when their relaxation

rate is located in the experimental frequency range.

In general, the measurements with

varying frequency are less accurate. This is caused by numerous uncontrolled standing

waves arising in the beam path due to reﬂections from the surfaces of optical components.

Such standing waves give rise to non-reproducible changes in the amplitude of the signal

upon the frequency sweep. However this problem is absent when performing magnetic ﬁeld

sweeps at a ﬁxed frequency, which we have utilized in present experiments.

Drude model for magneto-optical transmission

In order to analyze the magneto-optical data, a simple Drude model has been proved to

provide an adequate description4,6,12. Within this model a sample of mercury telluride is

7

modelled by an inﬁnitely thin ﬁlm with a two-dimensional conductivity σ2D = σ3Ddf . Here,

σ3D is three-dimensional conductivity and df is the ﬁlm thickness. In the case of nonzero
magnetic ﬁeld normal to the ﬁlm (along the z-axis) the conductivity is a (2× 2) tensor with
all components diﬀerent from zero:

σxx = σyy =

1 − ıωτ

(1 − ıωτ )2 + (Ωcτ )2 σ0 ,
(1 − ıωτ )2 + (Ωcτ )2 σ0 .

Ωcτ

σxy = −σyx =

(1)

Here, ω = 2πν is the angular frequency of the terahertz radiation, τ is the relaxation time

of the charge carriers, σ0 = ne2τ /mef f is the dc conductivity and Ωc = eB/mef f is the

cyclotron frequency.

A method to obtain the transmission spectra and the polarization state of the radiation

in case of a thin conducting ﬁlm on a substrate has been published previously10,21.

In

case of transmission data only approximate ﬁnal equations have been given and the matrix

equations have been inverted numerically. However, for a two dimensional conducting ﬁlm

on an isotropic dielectric substrate the complex transmission can be obtained analytically.

For a substrate with permittivity ε, the ﬁnal equations for the spectra in parallel (tp) and

crossed (tc) polarizers are given by:

tp =

tc =

where

axx = (1 + σxxdf Z0)(cos(kd) − ıZ sin(kd)) + (cos(kd) − ıZ −1 sin(kd))
axy = σxydf Z0(cos(kd) − ıZ sin(kd))

Here df is the conducting ﬁlm thickness, d is the thickness of the substrate, Z0 ≈ 377 Ohm
is the impedance of free space, Z = 1/√ε is the relative impedance of the substrate and
k = √εω/c is the wavevector of the radiation in the substrate. As can be clearly seen,
Eqs. (2) can be inverted analytically to get the solution for the complex conductivity. The

ﬁnal expressiond are a bit lengthy and they will not be presented here.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the spectra shown in Figs. 1,2 only a single cyclotron resonance is observed.

It is

therefore reasonable to use only one type of charge carriers in the description. Besides,

from the sign of the phase shifts it may be derived directly that the dominating carriers are

negatively charged, i.e. they are electrons. The solid lines in Fig. 2 are model calculations

according to Eqs. (1,2) superimposed with the data for 45 seconds illumination time. Good

quality of these simultaneous ﬁts of four data sets supports the validity of the approximation.

However, as will be seen below, in several cases the data suggests the presence of a second

type of carriers which in few cases may even dominate the spectra.

The parameters of the electrons in HgTe as obtained from the ﬁts are shown in Fig. 3. The

upper left panel (a) demonstrates the dependence of the charge carriers density n against

illumination time in the logarithmic scale. In order to accommodate the dark sample with

the illumination time 0, it is formally denoted by the time of 0.1 seconds in the ﬁgure. The

green circles are parameters for the sample #1 at 11.5 cm−1, the orange diamonds - for the

same sample at 21 cm−1 and the black squares are parameters of sample #2 at 28 cm−1.

The change of the concentration of at least one order of magnitude is clearly achievable in

the present experiment. As the illumination time is a parameter which is very speciﬁc for

the particular setup and generally has limited meaning, in the following the charge carriers

density n will be used in the plots as a tuning parameter.

The charge carrier relaxation rate 1/2πτ is shown in the upper right panel (b) of Fig. 3 as

a function of charge carrier density n. The ﬁt values for the same sample #1 at two diﬀerent

frequencies of 11.5 cm−1 (green circles) and 21 cm−1 (orange diamonds) coincide rather well

within the experimental accuracy (shown by error bars). An increase of the relaxation rate

toward low carrier densities is well known in semiconductor physics and is may be explained

by the decreasing screening of the random potential by the charge carriers. At low carrier

densities the eﬀective cyclotron mass becomes very low and the cyclotron resonances are not

resolved anymore. In this case the determination of the parameters of the carriers becomes

unstable and results in large error bars. The black squares show the ﬁt results for the sample

#2 at 28 cm−1. Here a systematic shift of relaxation rate towards higher values compared to

the sample #1 can be attributed to the uncontrolled changes during the sample preparation.

The inset (c) in the upper right panel of Fig. 3 demonstrates almost linear dependence

are parameters of the sample #2 measured at 28 cm−1, green circles denote sample #1 measured

at 11.5 cm−1 and orange diamonds are for sample #1 at 21 cm−1. Panel (a) shows the dependence

of the charge carrier concentration (electrons) upon the illumination time. The data for the dark

sample with no illumination is shown at 0.1 s in order to ﬁt into the logarithmic scale. Solid line

corresponds to a linear ﬁt. Panel (b) demonstrates the relaxation rate 1/2πτ as a function of the

carriers concentration n. Solid lines demonstrate the 1/2πτ ∼ 1/√n behavior. The dimensionless
2D conductivity σZ0 vs. concentration is presented in the inset (c). Here, Z0 ≈ 377 Ohm is

mass upon their concentration. The lines are square root ﬁts of the experimental parameters.

of the static conductivity σ0 on charge carriers density n. The linear character of the curves

and the fact that they closely coincide for both samples indicate that the mobility µ of the

charge carriers is constant across the samples and the density ranges. This is evident from

the formula for the conductivity σ = neµ.

The concentration dependence of the eﬀective electron mass in the HgTe ﬁlms is shown

in the panel (d) of Fig. 3. For both samples this dependence follow the square root law

mc ∼ √n. Especially for sample #1 (green circles and orange diamonds) the square root

behavior can be observed in extremely broad range of densities. The absolute values of the

eﬀective electron mass deviates only slightly for two frequencies, 11.5 cm−1 and 21 cm−1.

This may be an indication that that the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the cyclotron frequency

starts to deviate from the linear low-ﬁeld regime and an inﬂuence of the high-ﬁeld Ωc ∝ √B

regime is visible.

The square root behaviour is characteristic for the carriers with the Dirac-like dispersion
relations E = υF|k| as observed in graphene23. Here υF = const is the Fermi velocity. From
the expressions for the two-dimensional density n2D = k2
F /(4π) and quantum mechanical and
classical deﬁnitions of the the cyclotron frequency11,24,25 ωc = eBυF /(kF ) and ωc = eB/mc,
respectively, one get mc = √4πn/υF . These estimates clearly support the behaviour
observed in Fig. 3(d) and they correlate well with the results at higher frequencies15–17,26,27.

Hole contribution

The results presented above were clearly dominated by a single electron contribution.

Therefore, the description using only one type of carriers has led to reasonable interpretation

of the data. As mentioned previously, in case where the electron contribution was small,

additional details in the spectra could be detected. This can be interpreted as a contribution

of a second type of carriers.

In few experiments with samples in the dark even the dominating character of the hole

contribution could be observed. An example of such spectra is presented in Fig. 4.

In

this ﬁgure only the transmission in crossed polarizers is shown as it is mostly sensitive

to ﬁne details of the carrier contributions. The data are given in the complex plane plot

such as Im(tc) is plotted as a function of Re(tc) including the phase information (which

should be compared to conventional presentation in Fig. 2). In such a plot the magneto-

curve. Importantly, the sign of the charge carriers is directly obtained as the orientation of

the curve in the complex plane.

As a typical example, purple open circles in Fig. 4 mark the position of tc on the complex
plane at B = −0.14 T. It is clear, that the curve of the magneto-optical response in this case
is inverted between the dark and the illuminated sample. Open squares in Fig. 4 show the
path of tc(@−0.14T), i.e. the point which is close to one maximum of the response curve. In
the dark case the sample shows clear orientation of the hole contribution. After switching on
the light illumination the tc(−0.14T) shifts to the origin (0,0) and then increases again with

FIG. 5: Panel (a) shows magnetic ﬁeld dependence of transmission in crossed polarizers geometry

for sample #1 at 21 cm−1. The data are the same as in Fig. 2, but represented in the polar plot

form. Symbols are experimental results, lines - ﬁts within the Drude model using two types of

charge carriers. Strong deviations from the single carriers Drude model at low illumination times

are clearly seen. The dimensionless conductivity σZ0 and the carrier concentrations n as functions

of illumination time obtained from the ﬁts are shown in panels (b) and (c), respectively. Blue solid

circles denote electrons, red open circles - holes. The green and orange squares are ﬁt parameters

for electrons and holes as obtained from the data in Fig. 4. The inset in (b) shows the mobilities

of holes and electrons.

the opposite sign. This behaviour demonstrates the inversion from the hole to the electron

contribution.

Solid lines in Fig. 4 demonstrate the results of the ﬁtting to the measured data at ﬁxed

illumination time. The response on the electron side is well ﬁtted by the simple model. On

13

the hole side, only a qualitative ﬁt may be obtained (red line). In addition, the experimental

curve shows some ﬁne structure. This is an indication of the fact that further corrections

to the hole response may be needed, e.g.

inclusion of further charge carriers. However,

possible additional contributions are weak and their parameters cannot be reliably extracted

from the ﬁts. Therefore, in the present discussion only two contributions to the magneto-

optical response will be considered: electrons giving a main response and holes as a smaller

correction.

The HgTe samples investigated in this work showed distinct memory eﬀects. This re-

sulted in the fact that the ”dark” state of the sample could not be exactly reproduced.

Possible reason for these observation is the existence of charge traps with hysteresis eﬀects.

Normally, in the dark state as obtained after cooling from room temperature and without

light illumination, the contributions of holes and electrons were comparable. In this sense,

clear visual separation as exempliﬁed in Fig. 4 could be obtained only in the begining of the

experimental series. Other example of the spectra in the dark state is shown in Fig. 5(a)

by black symbols. Here more complicates picture compared to Fig. 4 is seen. Fortunately,

the overall behaviour of the experimental data could be reasonably described taking only

two sorts of the charge carriers into account. The results of such ﬁts are shown in Fig. 5(a)

as solid lines demonstrating that even a complicated behaviour may be qualitatively un-

derstood as a mixture of hole and electron contributions. The attempts to include more

charge carriers into consideration did not led to stable ﬁts. As the response of the holes is

weak, only few parameters like conductivity, density, and mobility could be determined un-

ambiguously. The eﬀective mass and the scattering rate of holes contribute to the mobility

simultaneously as µ = eτ /mef f and they could not be separated by the ﬁtting procedure.

The static conductivity and the density of electrons and holes in HgTe in the approxima-

tion of two types of charge carriers are shown in Fig. 5(b,c). As expected, the parameters

of the electrons in the two-carriers ﬁts remain basically the same as in Fig. 3 (electrons

only). Within the experimental accuracy the density of the holes remains independent of

illumination indicating that mobile hole states are not aﬀected by light.

The Dirac cone is symmetrical with respect to positive and negative directions in energy.

If the Fermi-level is above the Dirac point, the charge carriers are electron-like.

If the

Fermi-level in below the Dirac point, the charge carriers will have the holes-like character.

Fermi level for the samples in the dark state is most probably determined by the preparation

14

conditions and partly by the temperature/doping history of the sample. Electron and hole

contributions in the present study are observed from the same cyclotron resonance mode.

Therefore, we conclude that both types of carriers correspond to Dirac dispersion.

IV. CONCLUSION

Terahertz properties of the mercury telluride thin ﬁlms with critical thickness are inves-

tigated. Using optical doping by visible light illumination, the charge carrier concentra-

tion could be modiﬁed by more than one order of magnitude. In some cases, using light

as a parameter may switch the qualitative electrodynamic response from hole-like to the

electron-like. Especially towards low electron density the cyclotron mass shows a square

root dependence upon the charge concentration. This can be interpreted as a clear proof of

a linear dispersion relations, i.e. Dirac type carriers.
