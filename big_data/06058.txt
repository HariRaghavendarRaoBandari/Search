Abstract

We study the eﬀects of asymmetry in entanglement thermodynamics of CFT subsys-
It is found that ‘boosted’ p-branes backgrounds give rise to the ﬁrst law of the
tems.
entanglement thermodynamics where the CFT pressure plays decisive role in the entan-
glement. Two diﬀerent strip like subsystems, one parallel to the boost and the other
perpendicular, are studied in the perturbative regime, where Tthermal ≪ TE. We also
discuss the AdS-wave backgrounds where some universal bounds can be obtained.

Introduction

The AdS/CFT correspondence [1] has been a quite successful idea in string holography.
It relates conformal ﬁeld theries living on the boundary of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetime
with the supergravity theory in the bulk. The holographic idea of entanglement entropy
has also been a focus of recent study in string theory [2]. It has led to some understanding
of entanglement entropy in strongly coupled quantum mechanical systems, particularly
theories which exhibit scaling property near the critical points [3]. One signiﬁcant obser-
vation has been that the small excitations of the subsystem in the boundary CFT follow
entanglement thermodynamic laws somewhat similar to the black hole thermodynamics
[4, 5] 1. These calculations have become possible now because entanglement entropy can
be studied by using gauge/gravity holography [2], that is by evaluating the geometrical
area of some spatial extremal sufaces embedded inside asymptotically AdS geometry. It
has been proposed recently in [4] that the entanglement entropy (SE) and the energy of
excitations (E) in a pure AdS background give rise to a thermodynamic relation

△E = TE △ SE + V △ P + µE △ N

This has been described as the ﬁrst law of entanglement thermodynamics [4, 5], while
the charge contributions can arise in the boosted black-brane cases [9]. These charge
excitations could be the Kaluza-Klein (momentum) modes along circle or the winding
modes of a fundamental string wrapped along a T-dual circle.

In this paper we particularly study the eﬀects of boost (excitations) in asymptotically
AdS spacetimes on the nature of entanglement ﬁrst law. We ﬁnd that the boosted black
branes give rise to an asymmetry in the entanglement ﬁrst law. We study two types of strip
subsystems one parallel to the boost and the other perpendicular to the boost direction.
There is diﬀerence in the ‘entanglement pressure’ in two cases such that △P⊥ ≤ △Pk.
We ﬁnd that primarily the entanglement pressure is responsible for the diﬀerences in the
entanglement entropies, △S⊥ ≥ △Sk, in the two cases. The entanglement asymmetry
may be quantiﬁed as a dimensionless ratio

We ﬁnd that the asymmetry depends only on boost and it is bounded from above. The
bound is saturated only for the AdS-wave background, which is the case involving inﬁnite
boosts. To obtain these results we resort to a perturbative calculation of the entanglement
entropy up to ﬁrst order, where the ratio l
, of the strip width (l) to the horizon size (z0),
z0
is kept very small. This hierarchy of length scales can also be thought of in terms of the
temperatures as Tthermal

TE ≪ a1

The paper is organized as follows. In the second section we ﬁrst reproduce our earlier
results for the perpendicular strip case at ﬁrst order in the perturbative expansion. Then
we take up the case when the strip subsytem is parallel to the boost direction. The
entanglement laws are obtained at the ﬁrst order. In section-3 we deﬁne entanglement
asymmetry ratio. It is found that it depends only on the boost, which is a measurable
eﬀect. We also obtain entanglement asymmetry in the AdS-wave case also, in which case
asymmetry saturates the bound. Finally we conclude in section-4.

2.1 A thin (perpendicular) strip

We ﬁrst study the entanglement entropy law for a subsystem on the boundary of the
AdSd+1 backgrounds (1) where strip is perpendicular to the boost direction: the strip
width is −l/2 ≤ x1 ≤ l/2, while the boost is along y direction. Thus the steps in this
section are same as in our presious work [9]. We embed the (d − 1)-dimensional strip-like
(constant t surface) inside the bulk geometry. The two boundaries of the extremal surface
coincide with the two ends of the interval △x1. The size of the rest of the coordinates,
0 ≤ y ≤ ly, 0 ≤ xi ≤ li, is taken very large, such that ly, li ≫ l. As per the Ryu-
Takayanagi prescription [2] the entanglement entropy of the strip subsystem is given in
terms of the geometrical area of the extremal surface (constant time)

where Gd+1 is (d + 1)-dimensional Newton’s constant (of bulk gravity) and Vd−2 ≡
lyl2l3 · · · ld−2 is the net spatial volume of the strip on the boundary. We will be mainly
working for d > 2 here. In our notation z = ǫ ∼ 0 is the cut-oﬀ scale in the boundary to
regularize the UV divergences, and z = z∗ is the turning point of extremal surface in the
bulk. In the above area functional K(z), and f (z) are known functions, so we only need
to extremize for x1(z). From the entropy functional (4) it follows that a minimal surface
will have to satisfy

The expression (8) mathematically provides the value of entanglement entropy for a strip
subsystem of the boundary CFT. For pure AdS spacetime (z0 → ∞, f = 1 = K) these
integrals can be evaluated exactly [2], but in the presence of black hole it is diﬃcult to
ﬁnd analytical answers from the integral (8), although numerical estimates can always be
made.

When strip subsystem is a small part of a large system, the turning point will lie
in the proximity of asymptotic boundary region only (z∗ ≪ z0). One can evaluate the
entanglement entropy (8) by expanding it around the AdS (i.e. treating pure AdS as a
ground state). We shall take boost to be ﬁnite such that

where in the second line we have used the relation b1
. We may note
b0
that the remainder of the expression on the right hand side of eq.(17) is positive deﬁnite,
indicating that the net area of the extremal strip has eﬀectively increased as compared
to the pure AdS case. The presence of β dependent terms precisely contains the eﬀect
of boost on the area of the extremal surface. In the absence of boost these terms will
be absent and we shall get the result obtained by [4]. It suggests that the boosting of
the bulk metric (which forms a type of excitations in the CFTd) increases the strip area
and hence increases the entanglement entropy for the subsystem. Following from (17) the
change in entanglement entropy above the pure AdS (ground state), up to ﬁrst order is
given by

(18)

It is left now to carefully partition the right hand side in terms of physical thermody-
namic observables of the CFT. The physical quantities such as energy, and pressure can
be obtained by expanding the bulk geometry (1) in suitable Feﬀerman-Graham coordi-
nates near the AdS boundary [14], given in the appendix. These for the strip subsystem
of CFTd are summarised here. The energy of the excitations is

(21)

This pressure asymmetry is due to the boost. The pressure is more along the y (boost)
direction as compared to the xi’s coordinates.

We now express the equation (18) in terms of above physical observables. Using (19)

and (21) we can now express eq.(18) as

△S⊥ =

(△E −

(22)

(23)

The temperature is inversely proportional to the width of strip [4]. The equation (22)
simply describes the ﬁrst law of entanglement thermodynamics. An alternative form (with
out pressure term) was ﬁrst proposed by [4] for the isotropic AdS case, and that approach
leads to higher value of entanglement temperature. If we set β = 0 in (22), it will reduce
to the ﬁrst law as obtained by [5], with pressure components included.

2.2 Strip along the boost

We now study the entanglement entropy of a strip subsystem such that its width becomes
parallel to the boost (ﬂow) direction. That is, the boundaries of the extremal bulk surface
will coincide with the two ends of the interval △y: −l/2 ≤ y ≤ l/2. The regulated size
of rest of the coordinates will be taken much larger 0 ≤ xi ≤ li, such that li ≫ l
(i = 1, 2,· · · , d − 2).3 Taking the constant time slices the entanglement entropy of the
parallel strip becomes

where now Vd−2 ≡ l1l2 · · · ld−2 is the spatial volume. We will be working for d ≥ 2. From
(24) it follows that the minimal surface will have to satisfy the equation

(25)

3 We wish to embed the △y interval, and since the boost is also along y, both ‘time’ t(z) and y(z)
would have to be embedded inside the bulk in a covariant manner [12]. So one has to be a bit cautious
while working with stationary metric cases [10] [11]. However, it can be explicitly shown that, in the
perturbative expansion (for small strips) in order to know the entropy upto ﬁrst order (next to the pure
AdS), just taking a constant t slice would suﬃce. The deviations in extremal surface geometry away from
the constant time slice will contribute only at the second order terms in the expansion. Our aim in this
work is to know precisely the ﬁrst order terms in the expansions of z∗ and strip area A.

3 Pressure asymmetry and entanglement

Following from previous section, with out any loss of generality we can always take the
volume of the strip subsystems to be equal

Vk = V⊥ = l.Vd−2.

(35)

This only means that regulated size of the boxes is kept the same in both the cases, along
with the width l. It implies that

Comparing the two types of entropy results, the diﬀerence is given by

(36)

(37)

The right hand side is a positive deﬁnite expression. Hence we can deduce that entan-
glement entropy is more for a perpendicular strip subsytem as compared to the parallel
set-up, eventhough the energy of excitations and entanglement temperatures remain the
same for both. The key to this entropy enhancement eﬀect,

can directly be alluded to unequal entanglement pressure;

△ S⊥ ≥ △Sk

△ P⊥ ≤ △Pk.

(38)

(39)

Thus more energy is consumed by the excitations in the parallel strip (with an increased
pressure) as compared to the perpendicular strip (having a low pressure along the strip).
This suggests that in the boundary CFT ‘pressure’ plays a vital role in determining the
entanglement entropy of the subsytems. The equation (37) also implies that, up to ﬁrst
order, the net diﬀerence of the entanglement entropies is

S⊥ − Sk

(40)

Thus the entropy asymmetry coexists with the pressure asymmetry in the CFT. It is
because

△ S⊥|β=0 = △Sk|β=0.
We now deﬁne the entanglement asymmetry as a ratio

A ≡ △S⊥ − △Sk
△S⊥ + △Sk

=

β2γ2
(2 + d+3
d−1 β2γ2)

(41)

(42)

Thus nonzero boost (β ≤ 1) will always induce entanglement asymmetry in the boundary
CFT. The asymmetry will however vanishes for β = 0. Note that these results have been
derived in the perturbative regime described in (9) only up to ﬁrst order. We also learn
that the asymmetry will always be bounded. In the above the bound is saturated only in
the large boost limit, which we shall discuss in the next section.

We could however deﬁne an entanglement entropy ratio as

R ≡ △Sk
△S⊥

a quantity which depends on the boost only and is devoid of external factors like shape
and size. Then

A ≡

1 − R
1 + R ≤

d − 1
d + 3

.

(44)

We shall show that the bound is saturated in the case of AdS-wave in the next section.

3.1

β → 1, z0 → ∞ limit (pressureless system)

In present examples the pressure in the CFTd can be controlled by regulating the boost.
We now show that there exists a simultaneous double limit in which the pressure asym-
metry of the CFT excitations becomes optimal. We take a double limit β → 1, z0 → ∞,
keeping the ratio

The same double limit has previously been explored in [13] in connection with Lifshitz
type backgrounds from black Dp branes (lightcone coordinates). Under these limits the
bulk geometry (1) reduces to the following AdS-wave background

The width l is kept the same in both cases as well as the volumes. Hence entanglement
temperatures, TE = b2
πl , and △E, remain the same for both the cases. Particularly
in the former case there is no entanglement pressure along the strip (x1 direction). As
no ‘entanglement work’ seems to have been done by the excitations due to vanishing
pressure, the entropy remains maximal in the perpendicular direction. 4 While in the
latter case there is ﬁnite pressure along the strip width, so ﬁnite energy is consumed by
the excitations to work against the pressure as they take part in the entanglement. Thus
the work done against entanglement pressure costs ﬁnite energy which essentially leads
to a reduction in the net entanglement entropy in direction parallel to propagation of the
wave.

From equations (50) and (51) for the AdS-wave case the ratio becomes

This is a remarkable relation and is identical to one in (43). It remains true at the linear

4 The ‘entanglement work’ or aptly the ‘work function’ could be deﬁned as: △W = lVd−2 △P = l ·F .
The physical origin of entanglement work may be traced to the fact that ﬁnite pressure causes some
energy for the excitations to work against it. It is always proportional to the size of the strip. In other
words, there is a force F on the strip walls, and it will take △W amount of energy in moving the walls
upto a separation l. This in turn implies there will be a suppression of the excitations that can take part
in the entanglement. Note these entanglement quantities are purely of non-thermal in nature, as thermal
temperature is vanishing for the AdS-wave, correspondingly thermal entropy and thermal pressure are
also vanishing.

The entanglement asymmetry becomes

(53)

The asymmetry has optimal value and universal in nature. The relations (52) and (53)
are applicable only when d > 2, because for d = 2 (i.e. AdS3-wave) the analogue of △S⊥
does not exist, but the form of entanglement ﬁrst law as in (51) for parallel strip does
hold good.

4 Summary

It has been shown that the entanglement pressure plays a signiﬁcant role in determining
the entanglement entropy for the strip subsytems in the boundary CFT. There is an
entropy asymmetry in various directions of the CFT if their exists a pressure asymmetry.
Besides the entropy asymmetry is directly proportinal to the pressure asymmetry. We
determine entanglement asymmetry ratio

which depends only on the boost β and is bounded. The bound is saturated in the
large boost limit only. Thus a nonzero boost is simply a measure of the entanglement
asymmetry. We have also discussed a large boost case, which is the AdS-wave case.
Especially for these waves there exist an optimum entanglement asymmetry

which is universal result at the ﬁrst order. It is independent of any scale such as energy
of wave excitations ∝ 1
. We expect these results will get corrected by higher orders in
perturbation.
