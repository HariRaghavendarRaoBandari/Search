Abstract

It is shown that memory eﬀects in experiments measuring corre-
lations in entangled photon pairs are not able to produce a relevant
loophole for the test of local hidden variables theories.

Introduction

The Bell inequalities[1] are necessary conditions for the existence of local re-
alistic (or local hidden variables) models able to interpret the results of some
speciﬁc experiments.
In particular the experiments involving coincidence
measurements made by two separated parties, Alice and Bob, on entangled
pairs of particles. The relevance of Bell’s work is that there are idealized ex-
periments where quantum mechanics predicts violations of the inequalities,
which strongly suggests that for some actual experiments no local hidden
variables model is possible. The contradiction between local realism and
quantum mechanics is known as “Bell’s theorem”. The question whether the
contradiction also exists for actual, rather than ideal, experiments has led
people to perform many Bell tests. Until recently all tests have provided
results compatible with both quantum mechanics and local realistic mod-
els, the latter compatibility deriving from the existence of loopholes in the
tests. Last year several experiments have been performed that, for the ﬁrst
time, blocked simultaneously the two most relevant loopholes, detection in-
eﬃciency and locality[2], [3], [4]. The purpose of this note is to see whether
a loophole still remains, namely the memory loophole.

1

The memory loophole derives from the fact that tests of the Bell inequali-
ties require performing many similar experiments on diﬀerent entangled pairs
of particles in order to estimate the probabilities from the frequencies actu-
ally measured. In practice there is a series of trials with a given experimental
set-up, the trials being separated from each other by short time intervals. It
is usually assumed that any hidden variables associated with the nth parti-
cle pair would be independent of measurement choices and outcomes for the
ﬁrst (n-1) pairs. Models which violate this assumption exploit the possible
memory eﬀects. The strongest type of violation uses a 2-sided memory loop-
hole, in which the hidden variables for pair n can depend on the previous
measurement choices and outcomes in both wings of the experiment.

The memory loophole has been studied by Barrett et al.[5]. The authors
concluded that, although in principle the memory loophole implies a slight
ﬂaw in existing analyses of Bell experiments, the data still may refute local
realistic models. However Barrett et al. proved the irrelevance of the memory
loophole for tests of the CHSH (Bell type) inequality[6], whilst the recent
photon experiments test the CH-Eberhard inequality[7]. The point is that
the CHSH inequality (2) is apropriate for event-ready detectors, like in the
experiment by Hensen et al.[2], where the probabilities may be calculated on
a well deﬁned set of entangled particle pairs. In contrast the CH-Eberhard
inequality (1) is used when the set of pairs is not well deﬁned, as in the recent
photon experiments. In these experiments the photon pairs are produced via
parametric down conversion in a nonlinear crystal. The consequence is that
when neither Alice nor Bob detect a photon in a trial they cannot know if
either photons arrived to the parties but none was detected or no photon
was produced in the source during the trial. In fact the second case is by far
more probable. Thus in the photon experiments we cannot determine true
probabilities but only relative probabilities. The question arises whether the
memory loophole is also irrelevant in these conditions. In the following I give
an aﬃrmative answer to the question.

In photon experiments in more detail the Bell test is divided into a series
of trials. During each trial Alice and Bob randomly choose between one
of two measurement settings, denoted a and a′ for Alice and b and b′ for
Bob, and record either a “+” if they observe any detection event or a “0”
otherwise. The details of that type of Bell test may be seen, for instance, in
the experiments by Shalm et al.[3] or by Giustina et al.[4]. Alice may get two
possible results in each one of the two possible measurements of her photon,
and similar for Bob. Therefore there are 16 coincidence probabilities that

might be determined. In practice the Bell test requires just 4 that may be
combined in the CH/Eberhard inequality[7], namely

0 ≤ B ≡ P (0+ | ab′) + P (+0 | a′b)
+P (++ | a′b′) − P (++ | ab) .

(1)

The terms P (++ | ab) and P (++ | a′b′) correspond to the probability that
both Alice and Bob record detection events (++) when they choose the
measurement settings ab or a′b′, respectively. Similarly, the terms P (+0 | ab′)
and P (0+ | a′b) are the probabilities that only Alice or Bob record an event
for settings ab′ and a′b, respectively.

For comparison I write the CHSH inequality, that is

E(ab) + E(a′b) + E(ab′) − E(a′b′) ≤ 2,

(2)

where E(ab) denotes the expectation value of the product of the outcomes
of the measurements with the settings a and b. With the notation of eq.(1)
we have

E(ab) = P (++ | ab) + P (00 | ab) − P (+0 | ab) − P (0+ | ab) .

Actually the inequalities (1) and (2) are equivalent, in the sense that one
of them is fulﬁlled if and only if the other one holds true, provided that
the label “0” has the same meaning in both. But this is not obviously the
case when we compare event ready experiments, e. g. by Hensen et al.[2]
with experiments with photons produced via parametric down conversion,
like those of Giustina et al.[4] or Shalm et al.[3]. Indeed in the latter type
of experiment the CHSH inequality is useless because most of the times no
photon arrives at the detectors, whence we would have

E(ab) ≃ P (00 | ab) ≃ 1.

As a result the left side of eq.(2) is very close to 2 and, what is more relevant,
it cannot be calculated precisely because the fraction of trials corresponding
to no photons emitted from the source is uncertain.

In spite of these diﬃculties it is possible to prove that the test of local hid-
den variables is reliable. The proof follows. The joint probability P (x, y; a, b)
that the particles yield the outcomes x and y when subjected to the mea-
surement with the settings a and b respectively is given, according to Bell[1],
by

P (x, y; a, b) = Z dλρ(λ)P (x; a, λ)P (y; b, λ),

(3)

3

where, in our notation, x, y might be either + or 0. Eq.(3) may be taken as
the deﬁnition of local hidden variables model. Now let us assume that there
are memory eﬀects such that the hidden variables, λ, and the action of the
measuring devices in the trial n depend on all previous trials, j = 1, 2, ...n−1.
This means that we shall substitute the following

Pn(x, y; a, b) = Z dλnρn(λn)Pn(x; a, λn)Pn(y; b, λn),

(4)

for eq.(3) . That is, all possible memory eﬀect may just change the nature and
the probability distribution of the hidden variables, λ, and the probability of
outcome in the measurement for given settings, a and b. If the probabilities
of the 4 outcomes ab, ab′, a′b, a′b′ are 1/4, as insured by the random choice,
then inserting eq.(??) in eq.(1) we get the CH-Eberhard inequality

0 ≤ Bn ≡ Pn (0+ | ab′) + Pn (+0 | a′b)

(5)

+Pn (++ | a′b′) − Pn (++ | ab) .

This happens if an entangled pair of photons is produced in the source in the
nth trial, but if no photons are produced then eq.(1) gives

In any case for a set of trials we shall have

Bn = 0.

Bj ≥ 0,

Xj

where {j} represents the trials chosen for the test of the CH-Eberhard in-
equality. In practice it is common to choose, within some time interval, all
trials such that at least one photon is detected (either by Alice or by Bob).
The absence of bias in the random choice of the settings is essential for the
proof. For instance the local model

P (+; a, λ) = P (+; b, λ) = P (+; a′, λ) = 1, P (+; b′, λ) = 0,

gives B = 0, taking eqs.(3) and (1) into account, for unbiased random choices.
However if the choices a and b have probabilities (1+ε)/2 each and the choices
a′ and b′ probabilities (1 − ε)/2, then we get B = −ε in apparent violation
of eq.(1) .

We conclude that for photon tests involving the CH-Eberhard inequality
the possible memory loophole is irrelevant provided that the test involves a
large enough number of trials. For a small number there may be ﬂuctuations
that could give a wrong answer. The study of ﬂuctuations will not be made
here, it would be similar to the study made by Barrett et al.[5] in relation
with the CHSH inequality.
