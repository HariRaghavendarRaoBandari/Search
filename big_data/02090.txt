Abstract

We show that the required high quality of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry can be naturally explained in

the aligned QCD axion models where the QCD axion arises from multiple axions with decay constants

much smaller than the axion window, e.g., around the weak scale. Even in the presence of general Planck-

suppressed Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking operators, the effective strong CP phase remains sufﬁciently

small in contrast to the standard axion models without the alignment. The QCD axion potential has small

or large modulations due to the symmetry breaking operators, which can signiﬁcantly affect the axion cos-

mology. When the axions are trapped in different minima, domain walls appear and their scaling behavior

suppresses the axion isocurvature perturbations at super-horizon scales. In extreme cases the QCD axion

mass can be much heavier than in the conventional scenario, and becomes unstable in a cosmological time

scale. Our scenario predicts many axions and saxions coupled to gluons, and they may be searched for at

collider experiments. In particular, the recently found diphoton excess at 750 GeV could be due to one of

such (s)axions.

INTRODUCTION

The strong CP phase ¯θ is tightly constrained by the search for neutron electric dipole moment

(EDM) [1],

|¯θ| . 10−10.

(1)

Why ¯θ is so small is known as the strong CP problem. The strong CP problem is one of the re-
maining mysteries of the Standard Model (SM), and one plausible solution is the Peccei-Quinn

(PQ) mechanism [2, 3]. In association with spontaneous breakdown of a global PQ symmetry, a

pseudo Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, the QCD axion, appears. If the PQ symmetry is explic-

itly broken only by the QCD instanton effects, the QCD axion is stabilized at a CP conserving

minimum, solving the strong CP problem. The QCD axion in the form of coherent oscillations is

necessarily produced by the dynamical cancellation of the strong CP phase, and it can account for

the observed dark matter (DM) abundance.

While elegantly solving the strong CP problem, the PQ mechanism poses two potential prob-

lems. One is the origin of the (classical) axion window at an intermediate scale,

109 GeV . Fa . 1012 GeV,

(2)

where the lower bound is due to the observation of the SN 1987A neutrino burst duration [4–6],

and the upper bound is due to the axion contribution to the DM abundance barring ﬁne-tuning of

the initial misalignment. The origin of the PQ scale at an intermediate scale remains unknown. It

may arise from some combinations of the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scale and the Planck

scale [7–10]. On the other hand, there appear many moduli and axion ﬁelds in string theory

at the compactiﬁcation of extra dimensions, and one of them may be identiﬁed with the QCD

axion.
In this case the natural scale for the axion decay constant is of order the string scale,
Fa ∼ 1015−16 GeV, if the compactiﬁcation scale is comparable to the Planck scale. Such a large
axion decay constant generically leads to overproduction of the axion DM.1

The other problem is the required high quality of the PQ symmetry [17]. First, a global sym-

metry is considered to be explicitly broken in the quantum gravity theory [18], and so, we naively

expect that there are various PQ breaking operators suppressed by powers of the Planck scale.

However, such extra PQ breaking terms tend to give too large contributions to the strong CP

1 The axion abundance can be suppressed by the anthropic selection of the initial misalignment [11], late-time entropy

dilution [12–14], or early oscillations and adiabatic suppression due to extra PQ breaking terms [15, 16].

phase, spoiling the PQ mechanism. One can suppress dangerous operators by imposing discrete

symmetry ZN with large N, but the existence of such large discrete symmetry may be implausible.
Thus, the required high quality of PQ symmetry is a puzzle in the low-energy four dimensional
theory.2 One interesting possibility is that such high quality of the PQ symmetry is due to the

requirement that the axion should explain the present DM abundance [17], and we will return to

this issue later in this paper.

The axion decay constant is not necessarily in one-to-one correspondence with the associated

PQ breaking scale. The effective axion decay constant for multiple PQ scalars with arbitrary PQ

charges was studied in Ref. [22], where it was shown that the effective axion decay constant sen-

sitively depends on the PQ charge assignment. It was pointed out in Ref. [23] that the axion decay

constant can be enhanced by a factor of the largest hierarchy among the PQ charges in a model with

two axions and it was used to implement the natural inﬂation with a super-Planckian decay con-

stant. The enhancement is due to the alignment of the axion potentials. The alignment mechanism

with multiple axions was ﬁrst studied in Ref. [24], where they showed that an exponentially large

enhancement is possible without introducing extremely large coefﬁcients of the axions. This is

because multiple axions with a certain combination split the required large PQ charges into many

U(1) charges with a moderate magnitude. The alignment mechanism with multiple axions and var-

ious number of symmetry breaking terms was studied subsequently in Refs. [25, 26], where many

axions form the axion landscape (see also Refs. [27, 28]). The linear realization of the alignment

mechanism with two axions was ﬁrst studied in Ref. [29] and later extended to multiple ﬁelds [30],

where a peculiar structure of the U(1) charge assignment was noted. A more concrete realization

along this line was given in Refs. [31, 32], and it was coined a clockwork axion model.

We have recently proposed a QCD axion model based on the alignment mechanism with clock-

work structure [33], where one of the axions or saxions can account for the recently found 750 GeV

diphoton excess [34, 35]. In Ref. [33] we brieﬂy discussed the quality of the PQ symmetry. One

of the striking features of the aligned QCD axion model is that the actual symmetry breaking scale

can be much smaller than the conventional axion window (2). As a result, any Planck-suppressed
PQ breaking operators are highly suppressed compared to the usual scenario.3 The high quality of

PQ symmetry is a natural outcome of the aligned QCD axion model.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First we study the effect of Planck-suppressed PQ break-

2 String theory may provide a theoretical framework to address this question [19–21].
3 In the models considered in Refs. [36–41], where the PQ breaking scale is low and corresponds to the axion decay

constant, the QCD axion is visible but has a heavy mass to avoid the astrophysical constraints.

ing operators in detail in the aligned QCD axion model. In particular, we ﬁnd a new regime where

the axion mass mainly arises from PQ breaking terms, while the strong CP phase remains sufﬁ-

ciently small. Interestingly, the QCD axion can have a mass much heavier than in the conventional

scenario. Secondly, the axion cosmology can be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by such PQ breaking op-

erators, which induce small or large modulations on the axion potential. We investigate the axion

cosmology such as the axion DM and its isocurvature perturbations in the presence of PQ breaking

operators. In extreme cases, the QCD axion can be cosmologically unstable, decaying into hidden

photons.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the QCD axion model based on the

alignment mechanism in Section II, and then discuss in Section III how it explains the high quality

of PQ symmetry at low energy scales. The PQ breaking by quantum gravity is small enough

not to spoil the PQ mechanism, but it can play an important role in cosmology. We explore the

QCD axion dynamics in the early Universe in Section IV. Section V is devoted to discussion and

conclusions.

II. ALIGNED QCD AXION

In this section we discuss how the QCD axion arises from multiple axions with low axion

decay constants through the alignment mechanism. The Higgs scalar in the SM obtains a vacuum

expectation value (VEV) around the weak scale, but it is not clear yet which physics eliminates

the sensitiviy of the Higgs mass to high energy physics. Taking into account the gauge hierarchy

problem, we focus on the case where the original axion decay constants are around the weak scale

or TeV. The alignment mechanism [24] is implemented by multiple periodic axions,

with the potential of the form

for Λi ≫ ΛQCD, where ni (i ≤ N − 1) are integers, and we deﬁne nN = 1 to discuss the property
of the aligned axion for convenience. The above potential provides masses to N − 1 axions, and
there appears one ﬂat direction composed as

and thus it is enhanced depending on the values of ni and N. Assuming for simplicity that the
axions have

and |ni| ∼ n > 0

(i = 1, 2, ..., N − 1)

(7)

one ﬁnds that the QCD axion a comes mostly from φ1 and obtains an exponentially enhanced
effective decay constant when N is large:

To see how to obtain the alignment potential, we consider N complex scalars developing a

with mi ∼ f and λi ∼ 1.4 Then there appear N massless axions. One way to provide masses
to these N − 1 axions while enhancing the effective decay constant of the remaining massless
combination is to break N − 1 global U(1) symmetries non-perturbatively by introducing hidden
strong gauge interactions SU(ki) for i = 1, 2, ..., N − 1 and vector-like hidden quarks [24]:

mechanism. The following arguments are valid in the presence of such terms as long as they do not destabilize the

Both models possess one unbroken global U(1) symmetry, which corresponds to the U(1)PQ sym-
metry and is to be explicitly broken by the QCD instanton effects.

Before closing this section, let us discuss how to induce the coupling of the QCD axion to

gluons. The axion coupling to gluons can be induced radiatively from the loops of heavy PQ

quarks which are color-charged and obtain masses from the VEV of one of Φi. Note that the QCD
axion fraction in φi quickly decreases with i as in (5). Taking into that the QCD axion should
couple weakly to the gluons in order to avoid the astrophysical constraints, we add PQ quarks Q
obtaining mass from ΦN :

with NDW being the domain-wall number determined by the number of PQ quarks. The ellipsis
includes the couplings of the QCD axion to the other SM gauge bosons, which are suppressed also

by Fa.

III. QUALITY OF THE PECCEI-QUINN SYMMETRY

The QCD axion provides a natural solution to the strong CP problem by dynamically canceling

the CP violating parameter in the QCD. This mechanism works when the global PQ symmetry

6

is explicitly broken by QCD instanton effects and other explicit breaking effects are highly sup-

pressed. However quantum gravity is widely believed not to respect global symmetries. This

implies that there can exist Planck-suppressed higher dimensional operators explicitly breaking

the PQ symmetry. Thus it is important to understand why the quality of the PQ symmetry remains

good enough to solve the strong CP problem at low energy scales despite such quantum gravity

effects. The aligned QCD axion models can naturally explain the high quality of the PQ symmetry

because the original axion decay constants are much smaller than the effective decay constant of

the QCD axion.

Including the QCD instanton and possible quantum gravity effects, the scalar potential of the

QCD axion at temperature T = 0 can be written

while the second term represents explicit PQ breaking originating from quantum gravity effects.
Here we take 0 ≤ α ≤ π without loss of generality. The minimum of the QCD axion potential is
deviated from the origin due to the second term, and the strong CP violation angle is estimated to

(19)

(20)

This is the case where the QCD axion is stabilized mainly by the ﬁrst term in (17), and small shift
of the minimum is induced by the second term. The CP phase ¯θ should be smaller than about 10−10
in order not to generate too large neutron electric dipole moment. In the conventional QCD axion

scenarios, µ is similar to Fa in size as they are both determined by the VEV of PQ scalars, implying
that m✟✟PQ should be highly suppressed compared to mQCD to satisfy the experimental constraint
on the strong CP violation angle. However, for instance, a dimension-ﬁve Planck-suppressed PQ

breaking operator gives

m✟✟PQ ∼ 106GeV(cid:16)

for µ ∼ Fa, thereby badly spoiling the PQ mechanism unless α is extremely small. It is obvious
that the situation signiﬁcantly changes if µ ≪ Fa, which is indeed the case in the alignment axion
models.

On the other hand, if mQCD is not much larger than m✟✟PQ, the relation m2

✟✟PQ cos α may not hold for α ∼ 1. In such a case it is the second term in the axion potential (17)

QCD axion has

(22)

for µ ≪ Fa, and its mass is roughly given by m✟✟PQ. Note that in this case the axion potential
develops many local minima, making it difﬁcult to implement the PQ mechanism unless the QCD

axion is set to be close to the origin in the early Universe. We will return to this issue in Section IV.

A. Planck-suppressed dimension-ﬁve operator

Let us examine if the PQ symmetry can be robust against quantum gravity effects in the aligned

QCD axion model. Among Planck-suppressed higher dimensional operators, those of Φ1 are the
most dangerous because the QCD axion mostly comes from φ1. The dimension-ﬁve operator of
Φ1,

generates additional axion potential, which takes the form of the second term in (17) with

(23)

(24)

(25)

and so the induced mass is much larger than mQCD unless one takes very tiny κ5 or small f1. For
m✟✟PQ ≫ mQCD, the strong CP violation angle is simply determined by

¯θ ≈ 2 × 10−10(cid:16) α

0.1(cid:17)(cid:18)Fa/f1

108 (cid:19)−1

.

(26)

showing that the experimental bound on ¯θ can be avoided if the alignment mechanism enhances
the effective QCD axion decay constant by factor about 108 or larger, which can be achieved, for

,

8

instance, by ﬁfteen or more axions for n = 3. Note that the QCD axion is much heavier than in the

conventional scenarios because its mass is dominated by the contribution from Planck-suppressed

PQ breaking operators.

B. Planck-suppressed dimension-six operator

It is possible to forbid Planck-suppressed operators of odd dimensions by imposing an extra

discrete symmetry, which is presumed to be a remnant of some gauge symmetry in high energy

theory. Here we consider Z2 parity under which all the PQ scalars developing nonzero VEV are
odd

Z2 : Φi → −Φi,

(27)

which is a Z2 subgroup of the U(1)PQ symmetry. Then one of the most dangerous Planck-
suppressed operators is the dimension-six operator of Φ1:

∆V6 =

(30)

where the contribution from ∆V6 to the axion mass is given by

m✟✟PQ ≃ 0.5 × 10−3eVp|κ6|(cid:18) f1

103GeV(cid:19)2

,

(31)

which is comparable to or smaller than mQCD for f1 less than TeV. As can be seen from the relation
(19), the strong CP violation angle is suppressed for Fa ≫ f1, and further if m✟✟PQ is smaller than
mQCD. Note that the model with Z2 parity would suffer from the domain-wall problem if the PQ
symmetry breaking occurs after inﬂation.

C. Supersymmetric models

Let us brieﬂy discuss explicit PQ breaking effects in the aligned QCD axion within the su-

persymmetric framework. To implement the alignment mechanism, we introduce N pairs of the
SM-singlet chiral superﬁelds Φi + ˆΦi. One way to stabilize them is through the superpotential

model A : ∆W =

N

Xi

Xi(cid:16)Φi ˆΦi − f 2
i(cid:17) ,

(32)

for fi & mSUSY, where mSUSY is the soft SUSY breaking scale, and we have omitted coupling
constants of order unity for simplicity. Having soft SUSY breaking scalar masses of similar size,
Φi and ˆΦi are stabilized as

h|Φi|i ∼ h| ˆΦi|i ∼ fi,

as required by the F -ﬂat condition |Φi ˆΦi − f 2

i | ∼ m2

SUSY. Another way is to consider

model B : ∆W =

Φi ˆΦ2
i ,

N

Xi

(33)

(34)

with non-tachyonic and tachyonic soft SUSY breaking scalar masses for Φi and ˆΦi respectively,
and scalar trilinear terms. Here we have omitted Yukawa couplings. Then the competition between

supersymmetric and SUSY breaking effects leads to

Note that both models possess N global U(1) symmetries, and thus there appear N massless

h|Φi|i ∼ h| ˆΦi|i ∼ mSUSY.

(35)

axions.

Now we add aligning potential terms that give masses to N −1 axions and enhance the effective
axion decay constant of the remaining massless axion. As in the non-supersymmetric case, one

can consider two cases. One is to add

∆Walign = ǫ

N −1

Xi=1 (cid:16)Φi ˆΦ2

i+1 + ˆΦiΦ2

i+1(cid:17) ,

(36)

for small ǫ. Then the alignment is achieved with ni = 2 [32]. Instead one can consider non-
perturbative dynamics to get alignment [24]:

i and ˆΨc
fundamental representation of hidden SU(ki) gauge group which conﬁnes at Λi, while Ψc
belong to the anti-fundamental representation.

iα

How large are the explicit PQ breaking effects in the supersymmetric models? As discussed
already, the most dangerous Planck-suppressed operators are those of Φ1 and ˆΦ1 unless one as-
sumes large hierarchy among the original axion decay constants. Let us ﬁrst see the effect of

Planck-suppressed dimension-four superpotential term:

The additional potential of the QCD axion from the above superpotential takes the form (17) with

and α = tan−1(cid:18) Im(ξAξ)

(39)

where Aξ ∼ mSUSY is the soft supersymmetry breaking A-parameter associated with the ξ-term.
One thus ﬁnds that, for f ∼ mSUSY, the situation is similar to the non-supersymmetric case with
dimension-ﬁve operators. On the other hand, Planck-suppressed dimension-four superpotential

terms can be suppressed by the gravitino mass,

m3/2

ξ ∼

if gauged U(1)R symmetry is assumed, i.e., we have K ∋ X †Φ4
p while assigning appropriate
U(1)R charges to Φi and ˆΦi. Here X is the SUSY-breaking ﬁeld. Alternatively one may impose
some discrete symmetry to forbid dimension-four superpotential terms. Then the situation be-

1/M 3

comes similar to the non-supersymmetric case where Planck-suppressed dimension-ﬁve operators

are absent due to the Z2 parity.

IV. COSMOLOGY

Now we study the QCD axion dynamics in the early Universe in the presence of PQ break-

ing terms which induce extra modulations in the axion potential. Before going into details, let

us brieﬂy summarize the axion dynamics in the presence of such extra PQ breaking terms. Most

importantly, the QCD axion has a non-zero mass even before the QCD phase transition, and there-

fore, it may start to oscillate earlier than usual. If the PQ breaking terms are sufﬁciently large, the

QCD axion is trapped in one of the local minima for a long time, and the cosmological axion abun-

dance is modiﬁed. In extreme cases, the QCD axion remains trapped in a local minimum which

11

is stable during a cosmological time scale, and the PQ mechanism no longer solves the strong CP

problem. In some case, however, if the QCD axion has sufﬁciently large quantum ﬂuctuations, or
if PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken after inﬂation, the minimum closest to ¯θ = 0 satisfying
the experimental bound (1) is realized somewhere in the Hubble horizon. Then, domain walls

separating the local minima annihilate with each other, and the almost CP conserving minimum is

realized in the entire space. This solution to the strong CP problem is different from the ordinary

PQ mechanism in that quantum ﬂuctuations and domain-wall dynamics play an essential role.

For simplicity, let us consider the axion potential (17) taking account of the temperature depen-

dence of the QCD instanton effects [42]

with cT ≃ 1.68 × 10−7, c0 ≃ 1.46 × 10−3, ΛQCD = 400 MeV and ℓ = 6.68. The QCD axion mass
mQCD in Eq. (18) is equal to mQCD(T = 0). In general, the axion potential receives corrections
from various Planck-suppressed PQ breaking terms, in which case the axion potential will be

more complicated. Our analysis however captures the essential features of the axion dynamics,

and it can be straightforwardly applied to a more general case if one of the PQ breaking operators

dominates over the others.

First let us brieﬂy mention the case without the extra PQ breaking term, i.e., m2

✟✟PQ = 0. In
this case the QCD axion starts to oscillate when the mass becomes comparable to the Hubble

If the size of the Planck-suppressed operators is suppressed somehow by e.g. additional discrete

symmetries, the axion potential is dominated by the one from the QCD instanton effects when the

axion starts to oscillate. The PQ breaking terms may induce a non-zero strong CP phase, but the

axion dynamics is essentially same as in the conventional case. In particular, the axion abundance

as well as its isocurvature perturbations (if any) are not modiﬁed signiﬁcantly by the PQ breaking

terms.

During the QCD phase transition, the axion gradually acquires a mass from the QCD instanton

effects. At T = 0, the axion potential has a unique potential minimum (up to the domain wall
number NDW). This is because the curvature of the potential is dominated by the QCD instanton
effects, and the modulations are subdominant, m2

bation is slightly involved. If the typical size of the quantum ﬂuctuations is smaller than 2πµ and

the initial position of the axion is not close to the top of the potential, the isocurvature perturbations

are suppressed because the axion starts to oscillate earlier and its oscillation amplitude becomes

smaller and smaller as the Universe expands until the local minimum is destabilized by the QCD

instanton effects. The energy density associated with the isocurvature perturbations is smaller than

or comparable to the contribution (47). On the other hand, if the initial position of the axion is
close to the local maxima, or if the typical size of the quantum ﬂuctuations is larger than 2πµ,5 the
axion is trapped in different minima at different spatial points. The axion perturbations δa(x) be-

come highly non-Gaussian because the axion takes only discrete values when it is trapped in local

minima within the original Gaussian ﬂuctuation. The typical magnitude of the axion perturbations

at super-horizon scales is retained for the moment and still given by ∼ Hinf/2π. However, domain
walls are formed soon after the axion gets trapped at different minima. The domain walls will

quickly follow the scaling law, which implies that each Hubble horizon contains one or a few do-

main walls of the same type. As a result, the isocurvature perturbations at super-horizon scales are

considered to be suppressed by the domain-wall dynamics, even though the axion perturbations at
subhorizon scales are of order unity.6 (Here the size of the axion perturbations is measured in units

of µ until the QCD instanton effects turn on.) The domain walls annihilate and disappear when

those local minima are destabilized by the QCD instanton effects, and their contribution to the
ﬁnal axion density is considered to be smaller than the coherent oscillations (51) owing to µ ≪ Fa
unless the initial misalignment angle is very small. Thus, the axion isocurvature perturbations at

CMB scales can be suppressed by the scaling behavior of the domain wall dynamics.

C. Case of m2

✟✟PQ & m2

QCD

Now we consider a case in which the PQ symmetry breaking terms give the dominant contri-

butions to the QCD axion mass even at zero temperature. The strong CP phase at the minimum
closest to ¯θ = 0 can satisfy the neutron EDM bound if the enhancement of the decay constant due
to the alignment is sufﬁciently large, and/or if α is (only) mildly ﬁne-tuned, as we have seen in

Sec. III A.

Question is how the axion is stabilized at the minimum with the smallest ¯θ. There are many
(∼ fa/µ) local minima in the axion potential, and therefore, the original idea of the PQ mechanism,
namely, the dynamical cancellation of the strong CP phase, does not work. The axion will be

simply trapped in the nearest minimum from the initial position, and it will stay there until the

tunneling into the adjacent minimum takes place. Unless the initial position of the axion is set
miraculously close to ¯θ = 0, the Universe will be dominated by the axion potential energy and
continues to expand exponentially. The cosmological catastrophe, however, can be avoided if
the axion quantum ﬂuctuations are sufﬁciently large so that the true minimum close to ¯θ = 0 is
realized somewhere in the Hubble horizon. This is the case if the PQ symmetry is restored during

or after inﬂation, or if the quantum ﬂuctuation dominates over the classical value. Then, the true
minimum close to ¯θ = 0 will be realized in the whole Universe when domain walls annihilate after

6 Similar suppression of the isocurvature perturbations was pointed out in Ref. [44] in the context of spontaneous

baryogenesis due to axion domain walls.

the QCD instanton effect turns on. In the following we shall study this scenario, focusing on the

domain wall dynamics.

First, let us suppose that the quantum ﬂuctuations dominate over the classical ﬁeld value so that
ai ± δa contains the minimum closest to ¯θ = 0. Later we will brieﬂy discuss the case in which the
PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken after inﬂation. When the axion starts to oscillate, domain

walls are formed, separating various minima inside the axion ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The tension of

domain walls, σ, is given by

σ ≃ 8m✟✟PQµ2.

(52)

Once formed, domain walls will quickly follow the scaling law. In order to avoid the cosmological

domain wall problem, those domain walls must disappear when the QCD instanton effect turns on

and the energy bias between different minima is induced. The domain walls disappear when its

energy density becomes comparable to the energy bias, and therefore, domain walls separating

the minima with the smallest energy bias will be the most long-lived. Such domain walls connect
the minimum closest to the (almost) CP conserving one, a0 ≃ αµ, and the adjacent one, a1 ≃
a0 − 2πµ. The strong CP phase at a = a0 is given by

In order to solve the strong CP problem without ﬁne-tuning of α, one needs large hierarchy be-

smallest energy bias ǫmin is then given by

that we have here focused on the most long-lived domain walls, and there may be much larger

contributions from the other domain walls which have annihilated before. More detailed analysis

of the domain-wall dynamics with different energy bias is necessary, and we will leave it for future

work.

So far we have considered the case in which the PQ symmetry is already broken during inﬂa-

tion. If PQ symmetry is restored, cosmic strings are formed. In fact, the cosmic string formation

is rather complicated in the aligned axion scenario. This can be understood by noting that each

interesting cosmological implications, and we will discuss them in a separate work [45].

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The high quality of the PQ symmetry is a natural outcome in the aligned QCD axion model.

In this framework, the problem can be rephrased as a question: why such an alignment is realized

in nature.

It may be an accidental symmetry due to the locality in extra dimensions [32, 46].

Alternatively, it may be realized by requiring the axion DM [17]. Indeed, the longevity of DM

is a puzzle, and the QCD axion is a plausible candidate if the decay constant is sufﬁciently large.

If there are many gauge singlet scalars at the weak scale, they may conspire to generate one very

19

ﬂat direction to generate the right amount of DM. In non-SUSY framework, there are two natural

scales for those scalars. One is the cut-off scale like the Planck or GUT scale because their masses

are unstable against radiative corrections. On the other hand, once allowing the weak scale to be

realized by the ﬁne-tuning (or anthropic argument), these singlet scalars may also have masses

and VEVs of order the weak scale. This is the case if the quartic coupling between the SM Higgs

ﬁeld and the singlets are constrained to be non-zero. In this case, the aligned QCD axion model

emerges from the axion landscape at the weak scale [25, 26].

Lastly we mention cosmological implications of the present scenario in which the axion mass

is determined by the PQ symmetry breaking terms. The axion mass is generically heavier than the

conventional case, and therefore, the QCD axion can be thought of as axion-like particles whose

mass and decay constant do not satisfy the relation (18). Also the axion may be unstable in a

cosmological time scale. Suppose that the axion is coupled to a hidden U(1)H gauge symmetry.
A priori there is no reason to expect that the alignment takes place for the coupling to the hidden

photon, and its interaction may be written as

L =

(60)

where αH is the ﬁne-structure constant for the hidden U(1)H gauge interaction. The decay rate of
the axion into two hidden photons is

.

(61)

This is intriguingly close to the present age of the Universe. Such decaying dark matter may

improve the tension on σ8 [47]. Similarly, the axion is coupled to ordinary photons, but we assume
that the coupling to photons is suppressed by Fa to avoid various experimental and astrophysical
constraints on the axion. This can be realized if the coupling to photons is induced only by the

interaction like Eq. (14). In the absence of the decay channel into hidden photons, the axion may

mainly decay into photons producing a line signal in the X-ray spectrum. If its mass is about 7 keV
and Fa ∼ 1015 GeV, such axion may account for the 3.5 keV X-ray line signal [48–50].

In this paper we have studied in detail the quality of PQ symmetry in the aligned QCD axion

scenario and its cosmological implications. We have found that the PQ symmetry is much more

robust against Planck-suppressed higher dimensional operators compared to the conventional ax-

ion model. The axion abundance can be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed if the axion is trapped in one of

the local minima generated by the extra PQ symmetry breaking terms. Generally we expect that a

20

non-zero strong CP phase is induced by the Planck-suppressed PQ symmetry breaking terms, and

its contribution to the neutron EDM can be close to the current upper bound.

One important difference from the conventional axion model is that the axion decay constant is

not directly related to the dynamical scale of each PQ scalar in our scenario. In fact, the symmetry

breaking scale is much lower than the axion decay constant. This leads to an interesting and

important effects on the symmetry restoration and the subsequent formation of topological defects.

In the conventional axion model, we expect that the PQ symmetry can be restored if the inﬂation

scale or the reheating temperature is higher than the axion decay constant. In our case, one should

compare the inﬂation scale or the reheating temperature with the typical size of f, which is much
smaller than Fa in the classical axion window. Therefore, it is more likely that the PQ symmetry
is restored during and/or after inﬂation compared to the conventional scenario. In this case, the

axion is considered to be copiously produced by the annihilation of the string-wall network during
the QCD phase transition, constraining the axion decay constant as Fa = O(1010) GeV [51]. We
note however that the axionic string has a complicated structure made of sub-strings and domain

walls, and their formation and the subsequent evolution are quite non-trivial. We will study this

issue in separate publication [45].

As pointed out in Ref. [33], our scenario predicts many axions and saxions around the weak

scale. They are coupled to gluons in order for the QCD axion to solve the strong CP problem. So,

one of them can account for the recently found 750 GeV diphoton excess. The aligned QCD axion

therefore naturally connects the 750 GeV diphoton excess to the QCD axion, and provides various

implications for the axion DM. Further study is clearly warranted.
