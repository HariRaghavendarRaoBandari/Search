Abstract

We consider an ionic ﬂuid made with two species of mobile particles carrying either a posi-

tive or a negative charge. We derive a sum rule for the fourth moment of equilibrium charge

correlations. Our method relies on the study of the system response to the potential created by

a weak external charge distribution with slow spatial variations. The induced particle densities,

and the resulting induced charge density, are then computed within density functional theory,

where the free energy is expanded in powers of the density gradients. The comparison with

the predictions of linear response theory provides a thermodynamical expression for the fourth

moment of charge correlations, which involves the isothermal compressibility as well as suitably

deﬁned partial compressibilities. The familiar Stillinger-Lovett condition is also recovered as

a by-product of our method, suggesting that the fourth moment sum rule should hold in any

conducting phase. This is explicitly checked in the low density regime, within the Abe-Meeron

diagrammatical expansions. Beyond its own interest, the fourth-moment sum rule should be

useful for both analyzing and understanding recently observed behaviours near the ionic critical

point.

INTRODUCTION

Sum rules have been playing an important role in the study of charged systems for many

years. In general, a sum rule provides a relation between microscopic correlations on the

one hand, and macroscopic or universal quantities on the other hand. For charged sys-

tems, sum rules often express screening properties, so they shed light on the fundamental

mechanisms at work. Furthermore, they also provide useful constraints for approximate

theories. Sum rules have been derived for a large variety of charged systems, including

classical, quantum and relativistic plasmas, while they concern both static and dynamic

properties in the bulk or near interfaces. For instance, let us mention the last work [1]

by Bernard Jancovici, devoted to the study of the time-displaced charge correlations of a

relativistic one-component plasma coupled to radiation. Other examples, including many

contributions from Jancovici, can be found in two reviews [2, 3].

One of the most well-known sum rules for classical ionic ﬂuids was derived long ago

by Stillinger and Lovett [4], who shown that the second moment of equilibrium charge

correlations is given by a simple universal expression, valid in any plasma phase and in-

dependent of the microscopic details of the considered models. That second-moment sum

rule expresses the perfect screening of weak external charges. A few years later, Vieillefosse

and Hansen [5] derived another sum rule for the fourth moment of the charges correlations

of the one-component plasma (OCP), where identical positively charged particles move

in a rigid uniform neutralizing background. That fourth moment is expressed in terms of

the isothermal compressibility. Soon after that work, there was an attempt [6] to extend

such a fourth-moment sum rule to the two-component plasma (TCP) where both positive

and negative charges are mobile. The corresponding expression for the fourth moment

involves ill-deﬁned thermodynamic quantities, so its validity remained quite doubtful. A

more convincing approach for that TCP was introduced by van Beijeren and Felderhof [7].

However, the thermodynamical quantities involved in the expression of the fourth moment

are deﬁned through the application of suitable external potentials which are not explicited,

while the derivation itself is rather tough. In fact, a similar expression was obtained later

by Suttorp and van Wonderen [8] for a multicomponent ionic mixture (MIM), where all

mobile charges have the same sign and interact via the pure Coulomb potential, while a

rigid uniform background of opposite charge ensures overall neutrality. Then, all involved

2

thermodynamic quantities become well deﬁned within the considered MIM.

The main goal of the present paper is to derive a fourth moment sum rule for a general

TCP, namely to express such moment in terms of suitably deﬁned thermodynamical quan-

tities, similarly to the formulae derived for the OCP [5] or the MIM [8], [9]. Our strategy,

inspired by Jancovici’s style, consists in studying the response of the TCP to a weak ex-

ternal charge distribution with a plane wave structure. In the long wavelength limit, the

induced local particle densities vary on macroscopic scales. This allows us to compute the

response within some hydrostatic-like approach which involves local equilibrium states

with arbitrary densities. As a crucial point, a proper deﬁnition of equilibrium homoge-

neous non-neutral states with arbitrary densities naturally emerges within the framework

of density functional theory (DFT). Then the induced charge density is expressed in terms

of well-behaved thermodynamical quantities of an auxiliary system, which is nothing but

a TCP immersed in a rigid uniform neutralizing background. Comparing that expression

with the general linear response formula, we obtain the required fourth moment sum rule

for the charge correlations of the genuine unperturbed TCP.

According to the previous strategy, we ﬁrst introduce in Section II the various systems

which intervene in our analysis. Of course, we start by deﬁning the TCP, where a short-

range regularization of the pure Coulomb interactions is essential for avoiding the classical

collapse between oppositely charged particles. Two examples of such regularizations are

provided, associated with either soft or hard spheres. After recalling that the TCP is

always neutral and homogeneous in the absence of any external action on the particles,

we show how the application of a suitable external potential produces homogeneous non-

neutral states. This leads to the introduction of an auxiliary system, the TCP immersed

in a charged background, for which equilibrium states are well deﬁned for any set of

particle densities.

The general framework of DFT is exposed in Section III, where we provide the funda-

mental DFT equation which relates particle densities to the applied external potentials.

The central object in that relation is the free energy, which is a functional of particle

densities. For slow spatial variations, that free energy functional can be expanded in

powers of the gradients of particle densities, where the local ingredients are equilibrium

quantities of the above homogeneous auxiliary system. Let us mention that the idea of

using density-gradient expansions was introduced a long time ago by van der Waals [10]

3

for studying capillarity.

In Section IV, within DFT, we compute the induced particle densities of the TCP sub-

mitted to a weak external charge distribution with a plane wave structure and wavenumber

k. The resulting induced charge density exactly cancels the external charge distribution in

the long wawelength limit k → 0, as expected from perfect screening arguments. Further-

more, its amplitude at the order k2 included only depends on thermodynamical quantities

of the auxiliary system. In other words the square-gradient corrections in the free energy

functional, which intervene in the corresponding amplitudes of each induced particle den-

sity at this order, do not contribute anymore when forming the charge density thanks

to cancellations. Then, by comparing this exact expression of the induced charge den-

sity obtained by DFT with the linear response formula, we obtain the required sum rule

for the fourth moment of the charges correlations of the homogeneous neutral TCP. The

corresponding thermodynamical expression of that fourth moment involves not only the

isothermal compressibility of the TCP, but also partial compressibilities speciﬁc to the

auxiliary system. We brieﬂy discuss the content of previous approaches [6], [7], and we

show how the known results for the OCP [5] and the MIM [9] can be easily recovered

within our general method.

It is worthy to check explicitly the fourth moment sum rule for speciﬁc models where

exact calculations can be carried out for both microscopic and thermodynamical quanti-

ties. In Section V, we consider a model of charged soft spheres in the low density limit at

ﬁxed temperature. Within the Abe-Meeron resummations of the familiar Mayer diagram-

matics for particle correlations, we ﬁrst compute the lowest order terms in the density

expansion of the fourth moment of charge correlations, namely the terms of order 1/ρ,

1/ρ1/2, ρ ln ρ and ρ0 in the density ρ. Abe-Meeron resummed diagrammatics also provide

the low density expansion of the thermodynamical quantities involved in the fourth mo-

ment sum rule : the corresponding expansion of the thermodynamical expression of the

fourth moment exactly coincides with the previous purely microscopic calculation up to

order ρ0 included. That remarkable agreement holds for any values of the microscopic

parameters deﬁning the model.

In Section VI, we provide some additional comments about the derivation itself and its

underlying assumptions, as well as extensions to three and more component systems. Be-

yond its own conceptual interest, we also discuss a possible use of the fourth moment sum

4

rule for a better understanding of the conductor or dielectric nature of the critical point

of the liquid-gas transition of an ionic ﬂuid. It turns out that recent Monte Carlo simu-

lations [11] strongly suggest that the fourth moment of charge correlations diverge when

approaching the critical point, in a way close to that of the isothermal compressibility.

That observation was one of the motivations for the present work.

II. THE SYSTEMS OF INTEREST

A. Examples of two-component plasmas

We consider a two-component classical plasma (TCP) made with two species α = 1, 2

of mobile particles carrying positive or negative charges, let us say q1 = Z1q > 0 and

q2 = −Z2q < 0 with Z1 and Z2 positive integers. The corresponding Hamiltonian for a

total number of particles N = N1 + N2 reads

HN1,N2 =

N

Xi=1

p2
i
2mαi

+

1

2Xi6=j

uαiαj (ri, rj)

(1)

where αi = 1, 2 is the species of particle i. The two-body potential uαiαj (ri, rj) only

depends on the relative distance r = |ri − rj|, and it includes some short-range regu-

larization of the Coulomb interaction, which is crucial for avoiding the classical collapse

between oppositely charged particles. A ﬁrst soft regularization is embedded in the simple

expression

uαγ(r) =

qαqγ

r

[1 − exp(−r/dαγ)]

(2)

which remains ﬁnite at r = 0. The lengths dαγ control the exponential decay at large

distances of the short-range part of the two-body potential.

A second regularization amounts to introduce hard cores, namely

uαγ(r) = ∞ for r < σαγ and uαγ(r) =

qαqγ

r

for r > σαγ .

(3)

The corresponding TCP of charged hard spheres is suitable for describing many ionic

mixtures, where the hard-core interaction mimics the eﬀective repulsion between the elec-

tronic clouds of two ions. If σ11 and σ22 can be viewed as the eﬀective diameters of the ions,

5

the characteristic crossed lengths σ12 = σ21 diﬀer in general from the average (σ11 + σ22)/2

which would arise if particles really were billiard balls. This so-called non-additivity can

be understood by noticing that the σαγ’s are the typical ranges of the repulsions be-

tween electronic clouds for which no pure geometrical considerations apply. The simplest

version of that general asymmetric TCP is the celebrated Restrictive Primitive Model,

which is fully symmetric with respect to the charges and the hard-core diameters, namely

|q1| = |q2| = q and σ11 = σ22 = σ12 = σ.

Other short-range regularizations of the Coulomb interaction can be introduced. The

corresponding most general TCP will be denoted S. The following derivations are valid

for any S, beyond the above two examples.

B. The homogeneous neutral TCP

Let us ﬁrst consider that S is enclosed in a box with volume Λ, while no external po-

tential is applied to the particles. At equilibrium, all statistical ensembles should become

equivalent in the thermodynamic limit which is also assumed to exist. Furthermore, in a

ﬂuid phase, the bulk is overall neutral, that is the homogeneous particle densities ρ1 and

ρ2 far from the boundaries satisfy the local neutrality relation

q1ρ1 + q2ρ2 = 0 .

(4)

Strictly speaking, these remarkable results have been only proved in the Debye regime,

namely at suﬃciently high temperatures and suﬃciently low densities, for rather general

regularized interactions and rational ratios q2/q1 [12]. Moreover, there exists a proof for

charge symmetric systems, i.e. q1 = −q2, for any values of the thermodynamic param-

eters [13]. Let us also mention the beautiful proof for the quantum version with pure

Coulomb interactions by Lieb and Lebowitz [14]. According to all those rigorous results,

it can be reasonably expected that both the existence of the thermodynamic limit and

the local neutrality are valid for any classical TCP in the whole ﬂuid phase.

Important features of the various statistical ensembles are associated with the neu-

trality relation (4).

In the grand-canonical ensemble, the intensive thermodynamical

parameters are the inverse temperature β and the chemical potentials µα. It turns out

6

that only the linear combination µ = (Z2µ1 + Z1µ2)/(Z1 + Z2) is relevant and entirely de-

termines the total particle density ρ = ρ1 + ρ2. This can be readily understood within the

following simple heuristic arguments. Let us introduce, for any arbitrary conﬁguration,

the total number of particles N = N1 + N2 and the corresponding total charge Q = Mq

with M = Z1N1 − Z2N2. According to the decomposition

µ1N1 + µ2N2 = µN + νM

(5)

with ν = (µ1 − µ2)/(Z1 + Z2), we see that µ controls the grand-canonical average <

N >GC of the total particle number, while ν determines the grand-canonical average

< Q >GC= q < M >GC of the net charge. In the thermodynamic limit (TL), Λ → ∞

with β and µα ﬁxed, the contributions of non-neutral conﬁgurations with Q proportional

to the volume Λ become negligible, because the corresponding Boltzmann factors involve

a positive self-electrostatic energy which diverges faster than Λ itself. Accordingly, the

total charge density in the bulk

q1ρ1 + q2ρ2 = lim
TL

< Q >GC /Λ

(6)

vanishes for any given ν, while the total particle density ρ = ρ1 + ρ2 is indeed entirely

determined by µ and β.

In the canonical ensemble, the TL is deﬁned by letting Λ → ∞ and Nα → ∞, keeping

β and Nα/Λ ﬁxed. All excess charges go to the the boundaries in the TL, and the remain-

ing bulk is always neutral. The bulk thermodynamic quantities and bulk distribution

functions computed within the canonical ensemble then become identical to their grand

canonical counterparts. In particular the free-energy density in thermal units of this ho-

mogeneous neutral phase, which only depends on ρ and β = 1/(kBT ), can be computed

through

f (ρ, β) = lim
TL

(βXα

µα < Nα >GC − ln Ξ)/Λ ,

(7)

where Ξ is the grand-canonical partition function. This provides the familiar thermody-

namic identity

f (ρ, β) = β(ρµ − P ) ,

(8)

7

with the pressure P = limTL kBT Λ−1 ln Ξ. Since the pressure is also given by the thermo-

dynamic relation

we infer

βP = ρ

∂f
∂ρ

− f (ρ, β) ,

βµ =

∂f
∂ρ

,

(9)

(10)

which is analogous to the standard thermodynamical identity expressing the chemical

potential for a one-component system with short-range interactions.

C. The homogeneous non-neutral TCP in an external potential

In order to obtain a non-neutral homogeneous state of S with arbitrary uniform densi-

ties, one must apply a non-vanishing external potential on the particles. Let us introduce

the electrostatic potential ϕB(r) created by an uniform charge density cB, and the corre-

sponding external potentials U B

α (r) = qαϕB(r) seen by the particles. At equilibrium, the
total electrostatic ﬁeld inside the bulk should identically vanish. According to that simple

electrostatic argument, the induced particle densities should be homogeneous, while the

resulting charge density q1ρ1 + q2ρ2 carried by the particles should cancel the external

charge density cB.

Interestingly, the above quite plausible scenario has been exactly demonstrated within a

solvable model by Jancovici [15]. He considered identical point particles in two dimensions

with pure Coulomb interactions, which then take a logarithmic form.

In addition the

particles are submitted to a conﬁning parabolic potential, associated with a ﬁxed external

uniform charge density. For a special value of the temperature, all equilibrium distribution

functions can be exactly computed. The resulting particle density is indeed uniform in

the bulk and such that the total charge density vanishes. Furthermore, all higher-order

distribution functions in the bulk become translationally invariant in the TL.

D. The auxiliary system in a neutralizing rigid background

As suggested by the previous considerations, and for further purposes, it is convenient

to introduce an auxiliary system S ∗, where now the mobile positive and negative charges

of the TCP are immersed in an uniform rigid background with charge density cB. The

8

corresponding Hamiltonian of S ∗ reads

(11)

when the system is enclosed in a box with volume Λ. That system can be viewed as an

extension of the well-known One-Component Plasma (OCP) made of identical charged

particles immersed in a neutralizing rigid background. Now, there are two species which

are immersed in the background, similarly to the case of a Binary Ionic Mixture (BIM).

However, notice that here we do need a short-range regularization of the Coulomb inter-

action in order to avoid the collapse between oppositely charged particles, while the BIM

can be deﬁned with pure 1/r Coulomb interactions because all mobile charges have the

same sign.

Like the OCP or the BIM, the system S ∗ should have a well-behaved thermodynamic

limit, which is now taken with a ﬁxed background charge density cB. Now, in the bulk

region, which is again electrically neutral, the homogeneous particle densities satisfy the

neutrality relation

q1ρ1 + q2ρ2 + cB = 0 .

(12)

The corresponding free-energy density f ∗ of the homogeneous neutral system now depends

on β, cB and one particle density. Equivalently, f ∗ depends on β and on the two particle

densities ρ1 and ρ2. For any given set (ρ1, ρ2), the charge background density is adjusted

in order to satisfy the neutrality relation (12). This deﬁnes the function f ∗(ρ1, ρ2, β),

where now ρ1 and ρ2 are independent variables. That procedure is analogous to that

which deﬁnes the free-energy density fOCP(ρ, β) of the OCP for any value of the particle

density ρ where a suitable background charge density always ensure overall neutrality.

The homogeneous neutral TCP can be viewed as a particular realization of S ∗ for

densities (ρ1, ρ2) satisfying the neutrality relation (4) in the absence of any background.

For such neutral sets, each particle density can be expressed in terms of the total particle

number density as

ρ1 =

Z2

Z1 + Z2

ρ and ρ2 =

Z1

Z1 + Z2

ρ .

(13)

The thermodynamic quantities of the homogeneous neutral TCP can then be inferred from

their counterparts of S ∗ for the neutral set of densities (13). For instance, the free-energy

9

density of the homogeneous neutral TCP is given by

f (ρ, β) = f ∗(Z2ρ/(Z1 + Z2), Z1ρ/(Z1 + Z2), β) .

(14)

For further purposes, it is useful to consider the isothermal compressibility deﬁned by

χT = − lim
TL

Λ−1 ∂Λ

∂P

∂ρ(cid:21)−1

= β(cid:20)ρ2 ∂2f

∂ρ2(cid:21)−1

,

(15)

where all partial derivatives are taken at ﬁxed β. According to identity (14), χT can be

recast as

χT =

]−1 ,

(16)

where the second order partial derivatives of f ∗ are evaluated at the neutral set (13).

Eventually, all distribution functions of the homogeneous neutral TCP obviously reduce

to those of S ∗ for that set of densities.

III. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY

A. Grand-canonical description

Now we consider a general inhomogeneous state of S, where each particle of species

α is submitted to an external potential Uα(r). We deﬁne the inhomogeneous fugacity of

each species by

zα(r) =

exp[β(µα − Uα(r))]

(2πλ2

α)3/2

.

(17)

where λα = (β2/mα)1/2 is the de Broglie thermal wavelength of species α. The classical

grand-canonical partition function of S enclosed in a box with volume Λ reads

Ξ =

∞

XN1,N2=0

1

N1!N2!Z

N

Yi=1

dri zαi(ri) exp(−βVN1,N2) ,

(18)

where VN1,N2 is the potential part of the Hamiltonian (1). The inhomogeneous particle

density ρα(r) can be expressed as a functional derivative of Ξ with respect to zα(r), namely

ρα(r) = zα(r)

δ ln Ξ
δzα(r)

10

(19)

while parameters Λ and β are kept ﬁxed. The free-energy F in thermal units of S is given

by the Legendre transformation

F =Xα ZΛ

dr ρα(r) β(µα − Uα(r)) − ln Ξ .

(20)

The grand-partition function Ξ, as well as the free-energy F , can be considered as

functionals of either zα(r) or ρα(r). The functional derivative of F with respect to ρα(r)

is readily computed as

δF

δρα(r)

= β(µα − Uα(r))

(21)

where we have used identity (19) as well as standard calculation rules for functional

diﬀerentiation. The relation (21) will play a key role in the following. The density proﬁles

ρα(r) for each given sets (µα − Uα(r)) can be determined from that relation if one knows

the functional dependence of F with respect to the inhomogeneous densities : this is the

strategy of density functional theories (DFT). However, the main diﬃculty of DFT is that

the free-energy functional is not exactly known, except for hard rods in one dimension [16].

In general, approximate forms are used. Here, we will use exact asymptotic expansions

for densities with inﬁnitely slow spatial variations.

B. Homogeneous systems

As argued in the previous Section, homogeneous states of S with arbitrary densities

(ρ1, ρ2) are obtained by applying the external potentials

U B

α (r) = qαϕB(r) = qαZΛ

dr′

cB

|r′ − r|

(22)

with the external charge density cB = −(q1ρ1 + q2ρ2). If we introduce the potential part
V ∗
N1,N2 of the Hamiltonian (11) for the auxiliary system S ∗ with background charge density
cB, we can rewrite

N

VN1,N2 +

where

11

WB =

B

|r′ − r|

(23)

(24)

is the self-electrostatic energy of the background charge density cB. Inserting relation (23)

into the general expression (18), we obtain for the grand-partition function of S submitted

to the external potentials U B

α (r),

Ξ{µ1 − U B

1 (·), µ2 − U B

2 (·)} = Ξ∗{µ1, µ2} exp(βWB) ,

(25)

where Ξ∗ is the grand-partition function S ∗ for the same chemical potentials µα and a

background charge density cB, without any applied external potentials, i.e. Uα(r) = 0.

In the derivation of identity (25), we have used that WB is a pure constant which does

not depend on the particle degrees of freedom. This also implies that all the grand-

canonical averages for S submitted to U B

both particle densities are identical, so the particle densities of S submitted to U B

α (r) are identical to those for S ∗. In particular,
α (r) are

indeed homogeneous and they are merely related to cB via the neutrality condition (12)

valid for S ∗. Moreover, all particle correlations of both systems are identical.

If we insert expression (25) of Ξ into deﬁnition (20) of the free energy of S submitted

to U B

α (r), we obtain in the TL

F {ρ1, ρ2} −

β

2 ZΛ2

drdr′ (q1ρ1 + q2ρ2)2

|r′ − r|

∼ F ∗{ρ1, ρ2}

(26)

while cB has also been replaced by −(q1ρ1 + q2ρ2) thanks to the neutrality condition (12).

Thus, if we deﬁne, in general, the reduced free energy Fred of S by subtracting to F the

self-electrostatic energy of the charge distribution (q1ρ1(r) + q2ρ2(r)), namely

Fred = F −

β

2 ZΛ2

drdr′ (q1ρ1(r) + q2ρ2(r))(q1ρ1(r′) + q2ρ2(r′))

|r′ − r|

,

(27)

we ﬁnd the remarkable identity

Fred{ρ1, ρ2} ∼ F ∗{ρ1, ρ2} ,

which can be rewritten for the corresponding free-energy densities as

fred(ρ1, ρ2, β) = f ∗(ρ1, ρ2, β) .

12

(28)

(29)

Notice that this subtraction from the free-energy functional of the self-electrostatic energy

was ﬁrst introduced by Hohenberg and Kohn [17] for studying the quantum electron gas.

C. Density functional expansions for almost homogeneous systems

For states of S with slow spatial variations of the particle densities, the corresponding

reduced free-energy Fred{ρ1(·), ρ2(·)} can be expanded in powers of the gradients of ρ1(r)

and ρ2(r). The leading term in that systematic expansion is purely local and reduces to

Z dr f ∗(ρ1(r), ρ2(r), β) ,

(30)

where we have used identity (29) for the reduced free-energy density of an homogeneous

system. The ﬁrst correction, the so-called square-gradient term, reads [18, 19]

1

12Xα,γ Z dr M ∗

αγ(ρ1(r), ρ2(r), β)∇ρα(r) · ∇ργ(r) ,

(31)

where M ∗

body correlations, namely cSR

αγ(ρ1, ρ2, β) is the second moment of the short-range part of the direct two-
αγ (r) = cαγ(r) + βqαqγ/r, for S ∗ with homogeneous densities
(ρ1, ρ2). Similarly to the emergence of the free-energy density of S ∗ in the purely local

term (30), the direct correlations of S ∗ arise in the square-gradient term because all the

respective distribution functions of S ∗ and S with the same homogeneous densities are

identical as established above. Notice that for systems with short-range interactions, the

square-gradient expansion of the free energy F involves second moments of the direct

correlations themselves. Here, thanks to the subtraction (27) of the electrostatic self-

energy, the square-gradient expansion of the reduced free energy Fred involves second

moments of the short-range part cSR

αγ (r), which do converge thanks to the large-distance

behaviour cαγ(r) ∼ −βqαqγ/r when r → ∞.

The second correction to the purely local contribution (30) involves fourth-order spa-

tial derivatives of the densities, and it has been explicitly computed in Ref. [20]. The

corresponding local ingredients are fourth moments of two-, three- and four-body direct

correlations of S ∗ with homogeneous densities. Higher-order corrections would exhibit

similar structures with well-behaved local ingredients deﬁned for the same system.

IV. LINEAR RESPONSE TO A WEAK SLOWLY-VARYING EXTERNAL

CHARGE DISTRIBUTION

We start with S in the absence of any applied external potential, namely that realiza-

tion of S is nothing but the homogeneous neutral TCP. In a second step, let us introduce

an external charge distribution cext(r) = qext exp(ik · r), with an inﬁnitesimal amplitude

qext. Our aim here is to determine the induced charge density in S by DFT and compare

to its linear response expression. This will provide the required fourth moment sum rule

for the charge correlations of the homogeneous neutral TCP. In a ﬁrst step, within DFT,

we compute the density responses δρα(r) to the external potentials, Uα(r) = qαϕext(r)

with ϕext(r) the electrostatic potential created by cext(r), at leading order in qext and in

the limit of small wave-numbers k → 0.

A. Analysis within density functional theory

Since the applied external potential varies on an inﬁnitely large scale length, the par-

ticle densities should also display inﬁnitely slow spatial variations. Then, the free-energy

functional can be replaced by its density-gradient expansion introduced above, namely

F {ρ1(·), ρ2(·)} =

β

2 Z drdr′ (q1ρ1(r) + q2ρ2(r))(q1ρ1(r′) + q2ρ2(r′))

(32)

where the terms left over do not contribute to the deviations δρα(r) at the considered

lowest orders in k, as shown further on. The fundamental equation (21) of DFT then

becomes for each species,

(34)

where ϕtot(r) is the total electrostatic potential created by the charge distribution

(q1ρ1(r) + q2ρ2(r) + cext(r)). In Eqts. (33,34) all involved quantities of S ∗ are evaluated

for homogeneous densities identical to the local densities (ρ1(r), ρ2(r)) and inverse tem-

perature β. Moreover, all terms left over involve at least fourth-order spatial derivatives

of ρ1(r) and ρ2(r).

In order to compute the induced densities at lowest order in qext, we can linearize

Eqts. (33,34) with respect to δρα(r). The third terms in the l.h.s. of those Eqts. do not

contribute anymore since they are at least of order q2

ext. The resulting deviations take the

form of plane waves, like the forcing external charge cext(r), namely

δρ1(r) = A1(k) exp(ik · r) and δρ2(r) = A2(k) exp(ik · r)

(35)

where the amplitudes Aα(k) are proportional to qext. The total electrostatic potential

ϕtot(r) satisﬁes Poisson equation

∆ϕtot(r) = −4π [q1ρ1(r) + q2ρ2(r) + cext(r)] = −4π [q1δρ1(r) + q2δρ2(r) + cext(r)]

(36)

where the second equality follows from the overall neutrality of the unperturbed system

S .

In order to eliminate ϕtot(r) in favor of the induced density deviations, it is then

suﬃcient to take the Laplacian of the linearized versions of Eqts. (33,34). This provides

αγ is speciﬁc to the enlarged auxiliary system S ∗, the
microscopic second moments aαγ entirely depend on the direct correlations of the genuine

system S of interest.

The linear Eqts. (37,38) are straightforwardly solved in terms of the determinant of

the associated two by two matrix which reads

Therefore the proportionality coeﬃcient between a given amplitude and δqext, behaves in

the limit k → 0 as a constant, which depends only on the thermodynamic quantities χ−1
αγ ,

plus a term of order k2 which depends on both χ−1

αγ and aαγ. Now, if we form the induced

charge density

δc(r) = q1δρ1(r) + q2δρ2(r) = cind(k) exp(ik · r)

(42)

with the charge amplitude

cind(k) = q1A1(k) + q2A2(k) ,

(44)

Remarkably, the proportionality coeﬃcient between the induced and external charges goes

to −1 when k → 0, in relation with perfect screening properties, as discussed further.

Furthermore the term of order k2 in its small-k expansion now depends only on the

thermodynamical functions χ−1

αγ , and no longer on the microscopic quantities aαγ.

B. The fourth moment sum rule

The resulting induced charge density, can be also determined within linear response

theory, which provides

δc(r) = −

4πβ
k2

˜S(k)δqext exp(ik · r)

(45)

In the linear response formula (45), ˜S(k) is the Fourier transform of the charge correlations

of the unperturbed system S, i.e. the homogeneous neutral TCP,

˜S(k) =Z dr exp(ik · r)"Xα,γ

qαqγραγ(r) +Xα

q2

αραδ(r)#

(46)

with ραγ(r) the two-body probability density for the spatial conﬁguration where one

particle of species α is ﬁxed at the origin, while another particle of species γ is ﬁxed at r.

The small-k expansion of the amplitude cind(k) can be inferred from the linear response

formula (45) by inserting the corresponding expansion of ˜S(k),

˜S(k) = I0 + I2k2 + I4k4 + ... ,

(47)

which only involves powers of k2 thanks to the expected exponential decay of charge

correlations in real space. If we compare the resulting expansion of cind(k) with the DFT

result (44), we readily ﬁnd

I0 = 0 and I2 =

1

4πβ

(48)

which follow from respectively the absence of a 1/k2-term, and the identiﬁcation of the

constant terms. The vanishing of I0 accounts for the perfect screening of internal charges.

17

The universal value of I2, ﬁrst demonstrated a long ago by Stillinger and Lovett [4],

ensures the perfect screening of weak external charges. Beyond those well-known results

for the zeroth and second moments of S(r), the DFT expression (44) also provides a new

sum rule for the fourth moment, namely

ρ2

I4 = −

(4π(q1 − q2))2β3 (χ−1

11 χ−1

22 − χ−2

12 )χT ,

(49)

which follows from the identiﬁcation of the k2-terms. The compressibility χT emerges in

that sum rule, thanks to the identity (16) rewritten in terms of the charges q1 = Z1q and

q2 = −Z2q.

C. Related sum rules for other models

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of the OCP. A fourth moment sum rule for the corre-

sponding charge correlations SOCP(r) was derived by Vieillefosse and Hansen [5] through

a macroscopic analysis of ﬂuctuations. In their textbook [21], Hansen and Mac Donald

propose a simple derivation which is similar to ours. They compute the charge den-

sity induced by a weak external plane wave charge distribution within an hydrostatic

approach, where the force associated with the local pressure gradient is balanced by the

total electrostatic force created by both the external and induced charges. Notice that the

corresponding equation can be merely obtained by taking the gradient of the fundamental

DFT equation (33) restricted to a single species and where all non-local contributions,

including that involving the second moment of the direct correlations, are omitted. More-

over, the corresponding f ∗ can then be obviously replaced by fOCP. The fourth moment

of SOCP(r) then reduces to [5, 21],

I OCP

= −

1

(4πqρ)2βχOCP

T

.

(50)

Notice that this expression has been recovered through manipulations of the BGY hier-

archy, for pure Coulomb interactions [22] and also including short-range interactions [23].

The OCP result has been extended to a multicomponent ionic mixture (MIM) of all

positive point charges immersed in a rigid neutralizing background [8, 9]. Interestingly,

the derivation is intrinsic and does not rely on the response of the system to a weak

18

external charge distribution. Like the analysis [22] carried out for the OCP, it is based

on suitable manipulations of the BGY hierarchy equations for the distribution functions

of the inﬁnite homogeneous neutral system. A priori the derivation is only valid for

pure Coulomb interactions, without any short range regularization which is unnecessary

here since all mobile charges repel together. It makes an explicit use of the remarkable

homogeneity property of the resulting pair interactions. The fourth moment of charge

correlations in real space is then given by formula (7.3) in Ref. [9], which reduces in three

dimensions (d = 3) to

Z dr r4 SMIM(r) = −

120

βPα,γ qαqγ∂ργ/∂µα

(51)

where we have used that qv =Pα qαρα, while µα = β−1∂fMIM/ρα. Each partial derivative

∂ργ/∂µα is computed by ﬁxing the inverse temperature β as well as all µδ’s with δ 6= α.

Straightforward manipulations of the multi-variable functions ργ(β, {µα}) and µα(β, {ργ})

allow us to express all partial derivatives ∂ργ/∂µα in terms of partial derivatives ∂µα/∂ργ.

In the binary case, we ﬁnd

(53)

and inserting relations (52) into formula (51), we ﬁnd that the corresponding I BIM

exactly

coincides with our general expression (49) speciﬁed to the BIM, where the free-energy

density f ∗ merely reduces to fBIM. Indeed, our derivation also applies to the BIM where

q1 and q2 now have the same sign, while the auxiliary system S ∗ becomes identical to the

genuine BIM of interest with the background charge density cB = −qv = −Pα qαρα.

19

D. About other approaches

To our knowledge, in the literature, there exist two attempts to derive a sum rule

for the fourth moment of the charge correlations of the TCP. First, the hydrodynamic

approach carried out in Ref. [6] provides an expression for the fourth moment, diﬀerent

from formula (49), which involves ill-deﬁned thermodynamic quantities as well as particle

masses.

Its validity is then quite doubtful, in particular because classical equilibrium

charge correlations do not depend on particle masses.

Second, van Beijeren and Felderhof [7] proceed to an intrinsic analysis of charge corre-

lations within the grand-canonical ensemble, where they combine the Ornstein-Zernicke

equations with DFT manipulations.

In agreement with results previously derived by

Mitchell et al. [24], who shown that the fourth moment cannot be expressed in terms of

thermodynamic quantities of the sole TCP, they ﬁnd that it is necessary to introduce

non-neutral states of the TCP which can be realized through the application of a suitable

external potential. However, they did not provide any scheme which determines that

external potential. Thus their free-energy density f 0, from which the thermodynamical

chemical potentials are inferred through the usual identity written in formula (3.12) of

Ref. [7], remains a formal quantity, with no prescriptions for explicit calculations. This

ambiguity might explain why their work is not always cited. According to our analysis,

it can be easily clariﬁed as follows. In fact, as shown in Section II, the external poten-

tial mentioned in Ref. [7] is nothing but our potential U B

α (r) = qαϕB(r) where ϕB(r) is

the electrostatic potential created by an homogeneous background density. Therefore,

f 0 is identical to our free-energy density f ∗ of the TCP immersed in an uniform rigid

background. Then, the relation between partial derivatives (52) allows us to exactly re-

cast formula (6.26) of Ref.[7] as our expression (49), similarly to what occurs for the

corresponding formula obtained for the BIM by Suttorp [9].

V. ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS AT LOW DENSITIES

It is instructive to check the fourth moment sum rule for speciﬁc models and vari-

ous ranges of thermodynamical parameters. Here, we consider the model of charged soft

spheres with the pair interaction uαγ(r) given by formula (2). First, we brieﬂy describe

how the pair correlations of S ∗ can be represented by an inﬁnite series of resummed

20

Mayer graphs. Such resummed diagrammatics constitute a quite suitable framework for

deriving low-density expansions of the quantities of interest. From the diagrammatic rep-

resentation of charge correlations, we infer the low-density expansion of I4 deﬁned as the
coeﬃcient of the k4-term in the small-k expansion (47) of ˜S(k). The diagrammatics for

the pair correlations also give access to the free energy density f ∗ through thermodynam-

ical identities. The low-density expansion of the thermodynamical expression (49) is then

computed, and it is shown to exactly match that of I4, as expected.

A. Exploiting the principle of topological reduction

Let ρ∗

αγ,T(r) = ρ∗

αγ(r) − ραργ be the truncated pair distribution functions of S ∗, also
called pair correlations, for an arbitrary set of densities (ρ1, ρ2). As argued above,

the distributions function of S ∗, which includes a background with charge density

cB = −(q1ρ1 + q2ρ2), are identical to that of of a purely two-component system where

the mobile particles are submitted to the external potential (22) U B

α (r) created by the

background. Therefore, pair correlations ρ∗

αγ,T(r) are represented by series of Mayer dia-
grams [25] made with two root (white) points respectively ﬁxed at the origin 0 and at r,

and an arbitrary number of black points whose positions are integrated over. Each point

carries a statistical weight

zα =

exp[β(µα − U B

α )]

(2πλ2

α)3/2

,

while two points are connected by at most one Mayer bond

bM = exp(−βuαγ) − 1 .

(54)

(55)

Each diagram is simply connected, namely there exists at least one path connecting two

arbitrary points.

The previous Mayer diagrams are diﬃcult to handle because the fugacity weights (54)

are inhomogeneous and depend on the positions of the points. A great simpliﬁcation can

be achieved by virtue of the principle of topological reduction, nicely exposed in Ref. [21],

which consists in removing all articulation points. An articulation point is such that

there exists at least one subdiagram attached to it and not connected to the rest of the

diagram. In other words, the suppression of the articulation point leaves that subdiagram

21

disconnected from the two root points. If one sums all those subdiagrams attached to

a given articulation point, all articulation points are removed, while simultaneously all

fugacity weights (54) are replaced by density weights ρα [21]. Furthermore, the topological

structure of the diagrams is conserved through that reduction. Accordingly, the pair

correlations ρ∗

αγ,T(r) are represented by Mayer diagrams made with the two root points
ﬁxed at 0 and r, and an arbitrary number of black points, where the point statistical

weights are now the densities ρα. Two point are still connected at most by one Mayer

bond (55). Each diagram is again simply connected but is now free of any articulation

point.

Thanks to the translational invariance of both density weights and Mayer bonds, the

Mayer density diagrams reveal quite useful for explicit calculations as described further.

Notice that, remarkably, the background does not show in such diagrams, its eﬀects being

implicitly and entirely taken into account by the introduction of the homogeneous densities

ρα

B. Abe-Meeron resummations

Because of the long-range non-integrable decay of two-body interactions uαγ, every

Mayer diagram diverges. All those divergencies can be removed via chain resummations,

as ﬁrst noticed by Mayer [26] and Salpeter [27], and then performed in a systematic way for

the whole diagrammatical series by Abe [28] and Meeron [29]. A simpliﬁed presentation

of that method can be found in Refs. [30] and [31]. It starts with the decomposition of

each Mayer bond (55) as

with the truncated bond

bM = bT

M − βqαqγvC

bT
M = exp(−βuαγ) − 1 + βqαqγvC

(56)

(57)

and the Coulomb potential vC(r) = 1/r. After inserting the decomposition (56) into

every Mayer diagram, one proceeds to systematic resummations of convolution chains of

Coulomb bonds −βqαqγvC. Thanks to remarkable combinatorial properties [31], all those

resummations can be performed in terms of a single eﬀective potential, which is nothing

22

but the well-known Debye potential

φD(r) =

exp(−κDr)

r

(58)

with the Debye inverse length κD = (Pα 4πβq2

to two bonds [30], the Debye bond

αρα)1/2. The chain resummations give raise

bD = −βqαqγφD

and the short-range dressed bond

bR = exp(−β(uSR

αγ + qαqγφD)) − 1 + βqαqγφD ,

(59)

(60)

with the short-range part of pair interactions uSR

αγ = uαγ − qαqγvC. The topological

structure of the genuine Mayer diagrams remain unchanged, with bonds which can be

either bD or bR, and with the additional rule excluding convolutions bD ∗ bD in order to

avoid double counting.

Within the Abe-Meeron resummations, the genuine whole set of Mayer diagrams rep-

resenting ρ∗

αγ,T(r) is then exactly transformed into

ρ∗

αγ,T(r) = ραργXG

(61)

The so-called prototype graphs G are made with the two root points respectively ﬁxed at

0 and r, and an arbitrary number of n black points with density weights. Two point are

connected at most by one bond (59) or (60). Each diagram is simply connected, with no

articulation points, while convolutions bD ∗ bD are forbidden. The symmetry factor SG is

deﬁned as the number of permutations of labelled black points which leave the product

of bonds [Q bDQ bR]G unchanged. The summation is carried out over all topologically

diﬀerent graphs G, including the simplest graph with no black points.

In the diagrammatic representation (61), the contribution of every graph G is ﬁnite.

Indeed, at large distances, integrability is ensured by the fast decays of both the Debye

potential and the short-range part of pair interactions. At short distances, the Debye

bond remains integrable despite its 1/r singularity, while the short-range dressed bond

particle correlations. The two root (white points) are ﬁxed at 0 and r respectively. The

includes the short-range regularization which also guarantees its integrability. We stress

that representation (61) holds for any set (ρ1, ρ2) of densities, and then appears to be quite

useful for computing equilibrium quantities of S ∗. Moreover it is valid for any short-range

regularization uSR

αγ , including of course that describing soft or hard spheres.

C. Charge correlations

The Fourier transform (46) of the charge correlations of the homogeneous TCP can be

recast as

˜S(k) =Xα,γ

qαqγ ˜ραγ(k) +Xα

q2
αρα

(62)

where the Fourier transform ˜ραγ(k) of pair correlations is given by the sum of the Fourier

transforms of the contributions of all graphs G in the representation (61). Let us ﬁrst

consider the contribution of the simplest graph GD shown in Fig. 1, where the two root
points are connected by a Debye bond. Its contribution to ˜S(k) added to the constant

αρα in the formula (62) provides the well-known Debye charge correlations

term Pα q2

˜SD(k) =

κ2
D
4πβ

k2

k2 + κ2
D

,

(63)

which can be derived within a mean-ﬁeld treatment of correlations, without any diagram-
matic considerations. Now we stress that ˜SD(k) saturates the ﬁrst two moments sum rules
for I0 and I2, since ˜SD(k) ∼ k2/(4πβ) when k → 0. Therefore all the remaining graphs in

the representation (61) give no contributions to I0 and I2. That remarkable property is

related to the following reorganization of the series of graphs, which turns out to be also

quite useful for computing the fourth moment I4.

Let Gd be a graph in the representation (61) such that the root points 0 and r are not

connected to rest of the diagram by a single Debye bond bD, or in other words each root

point is connected to the rest of the diagram by either a bond bR or two bonds. Such a

graph can be dressed by Debye bonds in the sense that the three graphs shown in Fig. 2

also intervene in the representation (61). In GDd (GdD), the black point r1 is connected to

the root point 0 ( r) by a Debye bond bD, while the subdiagram connecting that black

point to the other root point r ( 0 ) is identical to Gd itself. In GDdD, the two black points

r1 and r2 are respectively connected to the root points 0 and r by Debye bonds bD, while

they are connected together by a subdiagram identical to Gd. Clearly, all possible graphs

Gd together with their dressed Debye family generate all graphs in the representation (61)

beyond the Debye graph GD.

Now, let us consider the total contribution to representation (61) of a given graph Gd

and of its dressed Debye diagrams. After deﬁning

Kαγ,Gd(r) =Z " n

Yi=1Xαi

driραi#hY bDY bRiGd

(64)

and noticing that all four graphs Gd, GDd, GdD and GDdD have the same symmetry factor

SGd, we can rewrite that total contribution as ραργ/SGd times

Kαγ,Gd(r) −Xα1
+ Xα1,α2

ρα1Z dr1[βqαqα1φD(r1)Kα1γ,Gd(|r − r1|) + Kαα1,Gd(r1)βqα1qγφD(|r − r1|)]
ρα1ρα2Z dr1dr2βqαqα1φD(r1)Kα1α2,Gd(|r2 − r1|)βqα2qγφD(|r − r2|)

(65)

The corresponding contribution to ˜S(k) in formula (62) can be readily computed by using
the convolution theorem and ˜φD(k) = 4π/(k2 + κ2

D), with the result

k4

(k2 + κ2

D)2 Xα,γ

ραργqαqγ ˜Kαγ,Gd(k)

(66)

divided by the symmetry factor SGd. Since that expression is at least of order k4 when

k → 0 for any Gd, all the graphs beyond the Debye graph GD do not contribute neither to

25

I0, nor to I2. Moreover, because of the prefactor of order k4, the resulting contribution to
I4 makes ˜Kαγ,Gd(0) appear. After adding the simple contribution of GD computed from

the Debye formula (63), we eventually obtain the diagrammatic representation of I4,

(67)

Representation (67) is well-suited for computing the low-density expansion of I4. In-

deed, and as usual, because of the density weights carried by the black points, only a ﬁnite

number of graphs contribute up to a given order. However, here we have to take care of

the dependence on the density of the bonds bD and bR through the Debye wavenumber
αρα)1/2. Consequently, the order of a contribution is not merely given by
counting the number of black points on the one hand, while half-integer powers and loga-

κD = (Pα 4πβq2

rithmic terms arise in the expansion on the other hand. We have computed the ﬁrst three

terms of that expansion, up to constant terms of order ρ0 included. In the Appendix, we

provide some technical details, as well as the complete list of graphs Gd which contribute

up to the considered order. The resulting expansion reads

(68)

Not surprisingly, the leading term in the expansion (68) is the purely Debye contribu-

tion, and it behaves as 1/ρ. The next correction is of order 1/ρ1/2 and is independent of the

short-range part of the interactions. Those short-range parts arise in further corrections

of order ln ρ and ρ0. The last two terms of order ρ0 are purely Coulomb contributions.

The expansion is valid for any set of densities (ρ1, ρ2), including of course the neutral

sets deﬁning the neutral TCP. For other short-range interactions, like hard cores for in-

stance, the structure of the low-density expansion of I4 is identical to that (68) explicitly

computed for charged soft spheres.

D. Free energy density

The excess free energy of S ∗ for any set of homogeneous densities, can be obtained

through the usual integration over the inverse temperature of the equilibrium average of

the potential part of Hamiltonian (11). The resulting free energy density in thermal units

f ∗(ρ1, ρ2, β) reduces to

f ∗(ρ1, ρ2, β) = fid(ρ1, ρ2, β) +

In that formula, the ﬁrst term takes the familiar form

to the purely Coulomb interactions in the particle-backround and background-background

parts of the potential energy of Hamiltonian (11). This also provides the third term which

merely reduces to

It is implicitly understood that pair correlations ρ∗

αγ,T(r) in formula (69) are evaluated at

inverse temperature τ .

The contribution of pair correlations ρ∗

αγ,T(r) to f ∗ follows by inserting its resummed
diagrammatic representation (61) into the second term of formula (69). The contribution

of a given diagram G reads

density, only a ﬁnite number of contributions (72) needs to be retained. In the Appendix,

we provide a few technical details of the calculations, as well as the list of graphs G which

contribute to f ∗ up to order ρ2 included. Adding the simple ideal (70) and background (71)

contributions, we eventually obtain the low-density expansion of f ∗,

(73)

The leading terms of order ρ ln ρ in the expansion (73) are ideal contributions. The

next correction of order ρ3/2 arises from pure Coulomb interactions, and is nothing but

the well-known Debye term. Contributions from the short range part of the interactions

appear in the terms of order ρ2 ln ρ and ρ2. The terms left over are least of order ρ5/2 ln ρ.

Expansion (73) is valid for any set of densities (ρ1, ρ2), and it gives access to all the other

thermodynamical functions of S ∗ through suitable partial derivatives with respect to the

independent parameters β, ρ1 or ρ2 deﬁning an homogeneous equilibrium state of S ∗.

For other short-range regularizations, the low-density expansion of f ∗ has the same

structure as (73). However, notice that for hard core potentials, the ideal term in the

decomposition (69) of the corresponding f ∗ must be replaced by the free energy density

of hard spheres, fHS(ρ1, ρ2, β). In the low-density limit, fHS(ρ1, ρ2, β) can be expanded in

entire powers of ρ around the ideal term (70). In the resulting full expansion of f ∗, there

are terms which depend only on the hard core diameters σαγ and not on the particles

charges.

Notice that the leading contributions of order 1/ρ in both χ−1

22 arise from the
ideal terms in f ∗, while the next correction of order 1/ρ1/2 comes from the Debye term in

11 and χ−1

expansion (73). The leading contribution of order 1/ρ1/2 in χ−1

12 is also provided by that

Debye correction. All terms which are left over in expansions (74), (75) and (76) are at

least of order ρ1/2 ln ρ.

According to the expression (16) of the isothermal compressibility, the thermodynam-

29

ical quantity in the right hand side of sum rule (49) can be rewritten as

The low-density expansion of that thermodynamical expression is straightforwardly com-

puted by using the expansions (74), (75) and (76) of the χ−1

which coincides with the leading term in expansion (68) of I4. The calculation of the

next correction of order 1/ρ1/2 remains simple, since it requires to retain only the ﬁrst

Debye corrections of order 1/ρ1/2 to the ideal terms in both χ−1

11 and χ−1

22 , while χ−1

12 can

be replaced by its leading Debye behaviour. The determination of the terms of order

ρ0 and ρ0 ln ρ is still straightforward but more cumbersome. Eventually, we ﬁnd that all

those corrections to the ideal behaviour (78) of the thermodynamical quantity (77) exactly

match the low-density expansion (68) of I4 inferred from its microscopic deﬁnition. Thus,

the fourth moment sum rule perfectly works, at least up to the considered order in the

density.

VI. CONCLUDING COMMENTS AND PERSPECTIVES

In this paper, we have derived a new sum rule for the fourth moment of charge correla-

tions of a TCP. Since the Stillinger-Lovett second moment sum rule naturally emerges as

a by-product of our analysis, we believe that this new sum rule holds in any conducting

phase, although all the steps of its derivation are not under a complete mathematical con-

trol at the moment. In particular, we expect that the free energy functional can be safely

expanded around homogeneous states inside the conducting phase. We stress that all the

partial compressibilities of the auxiliary system, namely second partial derivatives with

respect to particle densities of the free energy density, have then to be well deﬁned. Thus

critical points must be dealt with some care, since singularities in the thermodynamical

30

quantities arise on the one hand, while perfect screening properties can be lost on the

other hand, as mentioned below.

Our derivation also involves implicit assumptions about the existence of the thermo-

dynamic limit, and of intrinsic bulk properties with bulk densities which become ho-

mogeneous far from the boundaries. Strictly speaking, to our knowledge, this has been

only proved for the general three-dimensional TCP in the Debye regime [12] and for its

charge-symmetric version [13]. In two dimensions, where the Coulomb potential takes a

logarithmic form, both the neutrality and homogeneity of a TCP of point charges have

been proved [32]. Extensions of such results to all the systems introduced here would be

quite valuable of course, and might constitute the ﬁrst steps towards a complete proof

of our sum rule. Meanwhile, physical arguments, in particular related to the beautiful

proof for quantum Coulomb matter [14], strongly suggest that the classical TCP, as well

as its version immersed in a charged uniform background, do sustain a well-behaved TL.

Furthermore, there are strong evidences, arising either from speciﬁc models or mean-ﬁeld

approaches, that screening properties in the bulk can be disentangled from the reorgani-

zation of charges at the surface, so any boundary eﬀects can be indeed a priori ignored.

In the absence of a complete mathematical proof, checking the sum rule within ex-

act calculations for speciﬁc models or thermodynamical regimes is particularly valuable.

Here, such checking has been carried out for charged soft spheres in the low density

regime, through the explicit calculation of the lowest order terms in density expansions

of the quantities of interest. This illustrates the subtle interplay between short-range

and screened Coulomb contributions which ultimately ensure the validity of the fourth

moment sum rule at the considered orders. If there exists a simple reorganization of the

Abe-Meeron diagrams which shows the validity of the second moment Stillinger Lovett

sum rule at any order in the density expansion, a similar trick for the fourth moment sum

rule, certainly more cumbersome, remains to be discovered.

If our derivation of the fourth moment sum rule is based on the response to external

perturbations, more intrinsic derivations would be of great interest, both for enforcing

its expected validity on the one hand, and for sheding light on the internal mechanisms

at work on the other hand. For instance, the second moment Stillinger Lovett sum rule

can be retrieved within suitable manipulations of the BGY hierarchy equations for the

equilibrium distribution functions of the unperturbed homogeneous TCP, as shown by

31

Gruber and Martin [33]. Moreover, the BGY hierarchy equations have been also used for

deriving the fourth moment sum rule for the OCP [23] and for the BIM with pure Coulomb

interactions [9]. We are looking for extending such derivations to the TCP case, where

the presence of short-range interactions requires further manipulations. Notice, that a

full reorganization of Abe-Meeron diagrammatics as described above could be also seen

as an intrinsic derivation. In the same spirit, let us mention that a sixth moment sum rule

for the charge correlations of the two-dimensional OCP with logarithmic interactions was

established through a full term by term analysis of the Abe-Meeron diagrammatics [34].

The fourth moment sum rule obviously extends to the TCP immersed in a charged

background, namely the thermodynamical expression (49) of the fourth moment of charge

correlations is not restricted to densities satisfying overall neutrality, but it is valid for

any set of densities (ρ1, ρ2). This is well illustrated by the low density calculations for

charged soft spheres. Moreover, a similar DFT analysis combined with linear response

theory can be carried out for an arbitrary number n of components. This would lead to

formulae analogous to the thermodynamical expression (49), but with a more complicated

structure arising from the inversion of a n×n matrix. In the case of the MIM, they should

be equivalent to those derived by Suttorp [9]. Eventually, within our formalism, one can

obtain sum rules for the zeroth and second moment of particle correlations, by comparing

the DFT calculation of a given particle density to its linear response expression. Such

sum rules are again equivalent to those obtained for the MIM [9].

Among the various possible applications of our new sum rule, we would like to empha-

size its usefulness for a better understanding of the plausible lack of screening properties

at the ionic critical point. The liquid-gas transition of a TCP has been widely studied

the last twenty years. Let us mention for instance two recent works [35], [36]. Numeri-

cal simulations have convincingly shown that both liquid and gas phases display perfect

screening properties, namely the second moment Stillinger-Lovett sum rule is satisﬁed.

However, a ﬁrst suspicion about the violation of that sum rule at the critical point was

pointed out by Caillol [37]. Meanwhile, such violation was also observed for a solvable

asymmetric mean-spherical model by Aqua and Fisher [38], which is expected to share

common properties with an asymmetric TCP. More recently, and contrarily to various

theoretical expectations, the violation of the Stillinger Lovett sum rule at the critical

point was also observed for the fully symmetric RPM by Das, Kim and Fisher [11] : they

32

provide strong numerical evidences by combining reﬁned Monte Carlo simulations in the

grand-canonical ensemble with ﬁnite-size scaling methods. Furthermore, they also show

that the fourth moment of charge correlations diverges when approaching the critical

point, in a way analogous to the isothermal compressibility. Clearly, our thermodynam-

ical expression (49) of that fourth moment constitutes a promising tool for analyzing its

behaviour near the critical point, as well as the underlying coupling between charge and

mass ﬂuctuations.

Eventually, let us conclude by a few comments regarding the two dimensional case. In

two dimensions (2D), the Coulomb potential, deﬁned as the solution of Poisson equation,

takes the well-known logarithmic form. Thanks to the relatively weak singularity at

the origin of the 2D Coulomb potential, the TCP of point charges is well behaved for

coupling constants Γ < 2, namely at suﬃciently high temperatures [39]. However, short-

range interactions need to be introduced for Γ ≥ 2 in order to avoid the collapse between

positive and negative charges. The fourth moment sum rule derived here explicitly in

three dimensions (3D), can be straightforwardly extended to the 2D case : this leads

to the simple replacement of the factor 4π in formula (49) by the factor 2π, a direct

consequence of the modiﬁcation of Poisson equation when changing from 3D to 2D. At

Γ = 2, Cornu and Jancovici [40] exploited a mapping with a ﬁeld theory model valid

for pure Coulomb interactions, which allowed them to derive analytical expressions for

particle correlations of the 2D TCP. Such expressions are expected to become exact in

the zero density limit for the well-behaved TCP including short-range interactions. Thus,

they constitute a reliable starting point for further checking of the fourth moment sum

rule at ﬁnite coupling. Similarly to its application to the study of ionic criticality in 3D,

the fourth moment sum rule should also bring new insights for the celebrated Kosterlitz-

Thouless transition [41], [42] : in the temperature-density plane, there appears a line of

critical points separating a high-temperature conducting phase from a low-temperature

dielectric phase [43]. The implications of the fourth moment sum rule should complete

the results of a previous work [44], where a plausible scenario for the large-distance decay

of particle correlations in the dielectric phase was constructed in a way consistent with

various sum rules.
