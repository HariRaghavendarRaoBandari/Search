Harvesting vibrational energy with liquid-bridged electrodes: thermodynamics in

mechanically and electrically driven RC-circuits

We theoretically study a vibrating pair of parallel electrodes bridged by a (deformed) liquid
droplet, which is a recently developed microﬂuidic device to harvest vibrational energy. The device
can operate with various liquids, including liquid metals, electrolytes, as well as ionic liquids. We
numerically solve the Young-Laplace equation for all droplet shapes during a vibration period, from
which the time-dependent capacitance follows that serves as input for an equivalent circuit model.
We ﬁrst investigate two existing energy harvesters (with a constant and a vanishing bias potential),
for which we explain an open issue related to their optimal electrode separations, which is as small
as possible or as large as possible in the two cases, respectively. Then we propose a new engine
with a time-dependent bias voltage, with which the harvested work and the power can be increased
by orders of magnitude at low vibration frequencies and by factors 2-5 at high frequencies, where
frequencies are to be compared to the inverse RC-time of the circuit.

Small-amplitude oscillations are ubiquitous. Not only
devices like fans, laundry machines and speakers vibrate,
pretty much everything around us does. Converting these
mechanical vibrations into electric energy could provide
a valuable alternative to batteries in portable electronic
devices which require only modest amounts of electric
power [1]. Moreover, powering remote sensors with vi-
brations could relieve the requirement of connection to
the electricity grid. Unfortunately, engines based on in-
duction [2] or piezo electricity [3] are not well suited for
these small-scale applications since their power perfor-
mance rarely surpasses the 0.1W range [4].
In search
of a promising alternative, variable-capacitance engines
have received considerable interest in recent years [5, 6].

Variable-capacitance engines operate by cyclically
(dis)charging electrodes at alternating high (low) capac-
itance. Net electric energy is harvested during a cycle
because the charging stroke occurs at a lower potential
than the discharging stroke. The change in capacitance
can be caused by a mechanical stimulus as in the case of
vibrational-energy harvesters, but also by a change in the
properties of the dielectric or electrolyte material. Ex-
amples of the latter include electrolyte-ﬁlled nanoporous
supercapacitors where variable capacitance is achieved
by changing electrolyte concentration (in capacitive mix-
ing) [7, 8], or temperature (in capacitive thermal energy
extraction) [9], or combinations thereof [10, 11].

Variable-capacitance engines driven by mechanical en-
ergy typically consist of air-ﬁlled parallel-plate capacitors
connected to a battery, where the capacitance is modi-
ﬁed either by varying the plate separation or the lateral
plate overlap [12]. A key new development in these en-
gines was recently realized by Krupenkin and Taylor [4]
who suggested to inject an array of small liquid droplets
(Mercury and Galinstan) between the electrodes. Charge
on the capacitor’s plates is now balanced by the polariza-
tion of a dielectric ﬁlm whose thickness is orders of mag-

nitudes smaller than the plate separation (see Fig. 1).
This leads to signiﬁcantly larger capacitances and there-
fore to higher power densities of the order of 103Wm−2.
Due to the diﬀerence in permittivity between air and
most liquids, most charges will accumulate at the droplet-
electrode interface. When the liquid bridges are cyclically
compressed and stretched by a varying electrode sepa-
ration, the change in droplet shape leads to a diﬀerent
contact area and hence capacitance, which at a constant
bias potential directly drives a current.

To increase the suitability for practical applications,
a simpler circuitry was subsequently proposed without
the need for an external power source by Moon et al
[13].
Instead of an imposed bias potential, in this set-

broken by a diﬀerence in contact angles at the liquid-air-
electrode three-phase contact lines. Because electrode-
speciﬁc surface reactions will always lead to ﬁnite (but
small) charge densities on the electrodes, a current will
ﬂow when the plates are oscillating. However, the small
charge densities lead to a low power production of the
order of ∼ 10−3Wm−2. An additional problem facing
this set-up is that the water droplets used in this study
tend to vaporize after a few oscillations, requiring a con-
tinuous injection. This problem was overcome by Kong
et al [14] who investigated ﬁve imidazolium ionic liquids
which, due to their low volatility and toxicity, do not re-
quire an air tight space. Since the properties of the ionic
liquids can be adjusted by choosing diﬀerent ions, they
are “designable materials” that allow one to tailor-make
the droplets to ﬁt any desired application. For example,
operation outside the liquid temperature range of water
is now accessible.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic optimiza-
tion study of the diﬀerent engines w.r.t. to the mechani-
cal driving has been performed so far. While both Moon
et al [13] and Kong et al [14] showed that work output
increases with increasing oscillation amplitude, the av-
erage plate separation was ﬁxed in both studies. Note
that with increasing amplitude of the plate oscillations,
at some point the assumptions underlying the theoret-
ical analysis of the mentioned works will break down.
More speciﬁcally, in Ref. [4] it was assumed that a si-
nusoidal driving of the plate separation leads to a sinu-
soidally varying droplet-surface contact area A and hence
capacitance. Conversely, the droplet engines with asym-
metric contact angles [13, 14] have a sinusoidally varying
capacitance only on the hydrophobic surface, since the
contact line on the hydrophilic surface was assumed to
be perfectly pinned. The pinning can for instance be due
to surface heterogeneities but, as hypothesized by the au-
thors, can also be attributable to the diﬀerence in contact
angles. Regardless of its physical nature, pinning of the
contact line will have to break down when the droplet is
strongly compressed by large-amplitude oscillations (es-
pecially on low-hysteresis surfaces).

To access the regime of large-amplitude oscillations, of
special interest when optimizing the delivered power, in
this Communication we go beyond the previous analy-
sis by explicitly solving the Young-Laplace equation that
describes the droplet shape, assuming that droplets per-
fectly conform to Young’s law at the contact line. The
droplet proﬁles obtained serve as input for an equiva-
lent circuit model, whose solutions can conveniently be
displayed in the charge-potential representation. Since
these are conjugate thermodynamic variables, the en-
closed area during an operation cycle represents the work
delivered in one oscillation period. We will show that
the engine with bias potential thrives in the small plate-
separation regime, due to a large relative variable capac-

2

itance. Conversely, the asymmetric plate engine will be
found to thrive at large plate separation, because the hy-
drophilic plate contact area, which contributes negatively
to the performed work, is “eﬀectively” pinned. The men-
tioned pinning is not related to surface heterogeneities,
but is actually emerging in our idealized model. Decreas-
ing the plate separation breaks the pinning, and hence
breaks the asymmetry between the plates.

Having conﬁrmed and explained the results of Ref’s
[4, 13, 14], we then propose a new engine with a time-
varying bias potential. At the cost of introducing an in-
creased complexity in the circuitry, we show that this
engine harvests substantially more electric energy than
the droplet engines considered so far. While the enhance-
ment is quantitative in the high-frequency domain, in the
regime of low oscillation frequency we ﬁnd a qualitative
diﬀerence, attributed to the now ﬁnite work per cycle
performed in this regime.
Consider two parallel electrode plates separated by a
distance L, bridged by a droplet of volume V as visualized
in Fig. 1(a). The bottom plate is located in the plane
z = 0 and the top plate in z = L, with z anti-aligned with
the direction of gravity. The shape of the cylindrically
symmetric droplet as described by the unit normal ˆn to
the ﬂuid-air interface is determined by the Young-Laplace
equation [15], together with the boundary conditions set
by Young’s law at the droplet-plate interface,

γ (cid:126)∇ · ˆn = ∆p − g∆ρz,

γlg cos θb/t = γsl − γsg.

in terms of a pressure drop ∆p that acts as a Lagrange
multiplier for V, gravitational acceleration g, droplet
mass density ρ, and surface tensions γ between gas (g),
liquid (l) and solid (s). By choosing diﬀerent dielectric
coatings one can access diﬀerent tensions γsl and γsg on
either electrode plates, leading to diﬀerent contact angles
θb/t at the bottom and top plate. Note that throughout
this Communication the subscripts (b/t) refer to quanti-
ties associated to the bottom and the top plate, respec-
tively.

Hydrodynamic eﬀects, which at typical parameters
start to become important when the electrodes oscillate
at frequencies above f ∼ 50Hz, are ignored [13, 14].

Typical droplet proﬁles resultant of eqn (1)-(2) are
shown in Fig. 1(a). Varying the plate separation at ﬁxed
V, for each droplet proﬁle one measures the contact ar-
eas Ab/t of the droplet with the bottom and top plate.
In this way we obtain the relation between plate sepa-
ration and the respective contact areas. This relation
is shown in Fig. 1(b) in units of the capillary length
g∆ρ , which is the typical length scale of the prob-
lc =
lem (lc = 2.7mm for water and air at room tempera-
ture). For small plate separation L (cid:28) lc (conﬁguration 1
in Fig. 1(a)) the droplet is essentially a pancake-shaped
cylinder such that Ab (cid:39) At (cid:39) V

(cid:113) γlg

aration is increased to the order of the capillary length
L ∼ lc (details depend on relative contact angles), the
droplet starts to cave in under the inﬂuence of gravity,
such that Ab levels oﬀ while At shrinks much faster than
∼ L−1 (conﬁguration 2 and 3 in Fig. 1(a)) . In Fig. 1(b)
where we plot Ab and At as a function of L, we observe
that small variations of the plate separation can aﬀect At
by an order of magnitude, while Ab remains roughly con-
stant. This eﬀective pinning of the hydrophilic bottom
plate contact area, as mentioned in [13, 14], is emerging
rather than imposed. It is attributable both to the diﬀer-
ence in contact angles and the eﬀect of gravity. Gravity
alone is in principle enough to observe this eﬀect, in the
case of equal contact angles we observe in Fig. 1(b) a
similar eﬀect, but at larger plate separation.

A liquid-bridge variable-capacitance engine is con-
structed by connecting this droplet to a battery at po-
tential Vbat(t) and a load of resistance RL over which the
harvested energy will be dissipated (see Fig. 1(c)). The
electrodes, both coated with a dielectric layer of micro-
scopic thickness d and dielectric constant d, will acquire
net charges qb/t(t). These charges are a combination of
induced charges ∓q(t), together with ﬁxed charges Qb/t,
such that we write qb(t) = Qb−q(t) and qt(t) = Qt +q(t).
The ﬁxed charges can be due to surface-speciﬁc reactions
[13] but are typically small, such that any non-zero bias-
potential eﬀectively leads to a dominance of the induced
charges |q(t)| (cid:29) Qb/t.

The capacitance Cb/t on each electrode is an in-
series connection of a dielectric capacitor with an electric
double-layer (EDL) capacitor. Within the Helmholtz pic-
ture of the EDL the resultant harmonic mean reads

where the Debye screening length κ−1 sets the typical
width of the EDL of ions dissolved in the droplet of di-
electric constant l. In the absence of a dielectric layer
one can resort to more accurate descriptions of the EDL
which are well established [16, 17]. The capacitor is
driven mechanically; we focus on a sinusoidal oscillation
in the plate separation L(t) = L0 + ∆L sin ωt, with av-
erage plate separation L0, oscillation amplitude ∆L, and
oscillation frequency ω. Consequently, the surface areas
Ab/t[L], found through the Young-Laplace eqn (1), are
time varying, leading on the basis of eqn (3) to a time-
varying capacitance. We ﬁnd the potential of each of
the electrodes in terms of the net charges and capaci-
tances with Vb/t ≡ qb/t
. This deﬁnition in terms of the
charges present on the electrode plates requires an addi-
tional minus sign when splitting the capacitor potential
Vcap = −Vb + Vt. Kirchoﬀ’s voltage law now gives the

The term Wlost represents viscous and/or Ohmic losses
associated with the ion current within the droplet, which
in general will be small because for most systems RF (cid:28)

F(q, L, T) the free energy of the system at ﬁxed temper-
ature T, and with F the force between the plates) follows
the deﬁnition of electrostatic work dW ≡ −V dq done by
the capacitor. This provides the interpretation that the
work delivered to the load as found in eqn (7) is a combi-
nation of work performed by the battery Wbat, together
with energy harvested from the conversion of mechanical
to electric energy Whar. It is the latter term, and not the
total dissipated energy over the load WL, that should be
optimized for the purpose of energy harvesting.

In the remainder of this Communication we study the
steady-state solutions of eqn (4) in three speciﬁc cases:
case 1 a constant bias potential Vbat(t) = V0 with van-
ishing ﬁxed charges Qb/t = 0 [4]; case 2 no external
battery power, with ﬁxed charges Qb/t (cid:54)= 0; and case
3 a time-varying battery potential Vbat(t) with vanish-
ing ﬁxed charges Qb/t = 0. When calculating quanti-
ties with physical dimensions, we use the following real-
istic values: RL = 106Ω; a (Teﬂon) dielectric coating of

This deﬁnition with n = 1 was introduced in Ref. [13]
and sets the typical response time of the electronic sys-
tem. Note that in this case Wbat = V0
therefore drops out of eqn (7) such that WL = Whar in
this case (this equality was also checked numerically).
At the low frequency of ωRC 1 = 0.1 (cycle A) the elec-
tronic system is nearly relaxed throughout the mechani-
cal driving process, such that a small potential over the
load only slightly aﬀects the potential over the capaci-
tor with respect to the bias potential. Conversely, at the
high frequency ωRC 1 = 10 (cycle C) when the electronic
system cannot relax in response to the mechanical driv-
ing, there is a large spread in capacitor potential, with
high currents but little charge is ﬂowing between the ca-
pacitor plates.
In between these eccentric frequencies
lies an optimal “resonance” frequency ωRC 1 ∼ 1 (cycle
B) for which the enclosed area in the (q, Vcap) represen-
tation is maximal. We furthermore show a cycle D at
the resonance frequency but at a larger plate amplitude
∆L/L0 = 0.4. This cycle clearly encloses more area and
hence harvests more energy. These conclusions are sup-
ported by Fig. 2(b) where we show the ω-dependence of
the work WL for a variety of amplitudes ∆L
, where ω

is rescaled with RC 1 (dotted) and RC 4 (full lines). In-
terestingly, this ﬁgure shows a remarkable resemblance
to the Bode magnitude plot of a traditional RC-circuit,
especially for the generalized mean in eqn (9) with n = 4
(see also Fig. S1 in the supporting information). The

generalized mean with n = 1 performs well for ∆L
L0
but deviates appreciably when this ratio becomes of or-
2
der unity, where the variance RC
1 also increases
signiﬁcantly. From Fig. 2(b) we furthermore see that this
engine delivers more work for increasing ∆L

(case 2), electrode-speciﬁc reactions of the electrolyte ab-
sorbing to the plates can yet lead to net (equilibrium)

dition eqn (5) reduces to the relation between the equi-

vestigate the relative contributions of both plates to the
energy harvesting, in Fig. 3 we show the cyclic charging
state of each electrode separately: in (a) for a relatively
small electrode separation of L0 = 0.5lc, and in (b) for
L0 = 0.9lc. In the absence of an external voltage source,
the variables are now made dimensionless with the initial
charge on the bottom capacitor Qb (see supporting infor-
mation for details). In eqn (7) we separate the contribu-
tions of each of the electrodes to ﬁnd (ignoring viscous
losses over RF),

Fig. 3(a) and (b) clearly show that the net charge is dom-
inated by initial charges Qb/t (cid:29) |q(t)| ⇒ qb/t(t) ≈ Qb/t
for this case, such that the potentials Vb/t appearing in
eqn (11) have the same sign. An extra minus sign due
to the anti-clockwise nature of the charging cycles in the
(q, Vcap) representation leads to the conclusion that the
bottom plate does negative work. It then follows from
eqn (11) that the grey shaded area in Fig. 3(a) and (b)
represents the harvested work Whar. This is to be con-
trasted with case 1 for which qb/t(t) = ∓q(t) such that

both (comparable) contributions of the electrodes to the
harvested work add up.

As was mentioned in Ref. [13], decreasing the average
plate separation has an adverse eﬀect on the harvested
work. Within our model this can be interpreted on the
basis of the asymmetry between bottom and top plate.
This asymmetry, induced both by gravity and the diﬀer-
ent contact angles, is stronger for larger electrode sep-
arations (Fig. 1(b)). At large plate separations L ∼ lc
small variations of L only aﬀect the surface area of the
hydrophobic top plate. The bottom plate, subject to
an “eﬀective pinning”, has a (roughly) constant contact
area hence capacitance, and therefore the ﬁrst term on
the r.h.s. of eqn (11) vanishes. Conversely, decreasing
L0 will lift the asymmetry between the bottom and the
top plate: the contact areas will now be similarly aﬀected
by variation of L. The advent of variable capacitance on
the bottom plate is observed in Fig. 3(a) as the “open-
ing up” of the white area enclosed by the dashed line,
when compared to Fig. 3(b) where the bottom electrode
does not contribute. Due to the relative minus sign in
eqn (11), the now ﬁnite contribution of the bottom plate
has a detrimental eﬀect on the harvested power, which is
seen in Fig. 3(a) as a decrease in the grey shaded area.

In Fig. 3(c) we summarize (on a log-scale that spans
many decades) the two opposing trends of decreas-
ing/increasing work-output in case1/case2 upon increas-
ing the average spacing L0.

The introduction of a time-dependent bias potential
Vbat(t) (case 3) in principle could improve the perfor-
mance of the droplet engine, for example when the ca-
pacitor potential Vcap is lowered when the electrodes
are charging and increased when electrodes discharge.
Note that in this case eqn (7) picks up a ﬁnite con-
(cid:54)= 0). We con-
sider a square-wave bias potential Vbat(t) = Vsq(t) ≡
V0 + limξ→∞ ∆V tanh (ξ sin (ωt + δ)) (we use ξ = 30), at
the same angular frequency ω as the mechanical driving.
The variable voltage source Vsq(t) is not only character-
ized by an average potential V0 and an amplitude ∆V ,
but also by a phase diﬀerence δ between the imposed me-
chanical vibration L(t) and the applied potential Vbat(t),
with respect to which we will optimize.

In Fig. 4(a) we show the steady state of the charg-
ing/discharging cycle of the capacitor in the charge-
voltage representation (q, Vcap) for a set of
frequen-
cies ωRC 1 = {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100} (denoted with A-
E), each evaluated at their respective δmax, the value

through four successive steps in which the droplet is com-
pressed at low Vcap, charged (quickly) at small plate sep-
aration separation L0 − ∆L, stretched at high Vcap, fol-
lowed by a (quick) discharging at maximal separation
L0 + ∆L.

There is an interesting analogy to be drawn between
this quasi-static cycle and those performed by classic
heat engines. The latter have an internal energy U(S, V )
whose diﬀerential reads dU = TdS − pdV , in terms of
the entropy S and volume V of a piston at pressure p. A
mapping of thermodynamic variables F ⇔ U, −F ⇔ T,
L ⇔ S, Vcap ⇔ −p and Q ⇔ V , very much in the spirit
of Ref. [20, 21] where similar reasoning was employed
to capacitive mixing processes, shows that the charg-
ing cycle is thermodynamically equivalent to an adia-
batic compression-isobaric heating-adiabatic expansion-
isobaric cooling “Brayton” cycle [22].

The frequency dependence of the harvested work per
cycle is shown in Fig. 4(b) for several ∆V
. For all oscilla-
V0
tion frequencies the introduction of the time-dependent
bias potential notably increases the harvested work dur-
ing a cycle. This eﬀect is most dramatic at low frequen-
cies where square-wave driving results in a ﬁnite har-
vested work, contrary to the constant Vbat(t) = V0 for
which Whar vanishes for decreasing ω. This can also be
observed from Fig. 4(a), where the cycles A and B en-
close a ﬁnite area in the charge-potential representation
even though ωRC 1 (cid:28) 1. The square-wave driving then
leads to an enclosed area of trapezoidal shape, which can
be expressed analytically in terms of the charging state
Vbat(q) at the extremal points of each of the strokes (see
supporting information). The resulting expression for
the work, eqn (S13), increases monotonic with ∆L/L0,
and is maximal for ∆V /V0 = 1. Increasing ∆V /V0 be-
yond this value leads to a time interval during this cy-
cle where V (t) is negative. The engine delivers negative
work in this time interval, because the path, that en-
closes a ﬁnite area in the charge/potential representation
reverses its order from anti-clockwise to clockwise. This
is supported by Fig. 4(b) where the green dotted line at
∆V /V0 = 2 achieves lower work for all frequencies than
the black line at ∆V /V0 = 1. As shown in Fig. 4(b), for
high oscillation frequencies the work delivered per cycle
vanishes. However, the harvested power Phar ≡ Whar/T
(Fig. 4(c)) reaches a maximum plateau value in this high-
frequency regime. At low frequencies, for which we saw
a non-vanishing work output for the electrically driven
(∆V > 0) systems, the delivered power per cycle de-
creases with a smaller slope than the ∆V = 0 curve. For
typical parameters, L0 = 0.4mm, and ∆L = 0.2mm, the
peak in performed work per cycle at ωRC 1 ∼ 1 corre-
sponds to a frequency f ∼ 50Hz. The plateau of the
delivered power is reached ωRC 1 ∼ 10, corresponding to
f ∼ 500Hz, a frequency at which hydrodynamic eﬀects
will undoubtedly be eminent [13]. Notice however that
there are several ways to increase ωRC 1 without chang-

array of droplets would increase RC 1. Moreover, using
a larger resistance, or using large amplitude oscillations

→ 1 increases RC 1.
In conclusion, as a ﬁrst step towards a more real-
istic treatment of the capacitance of oscillating elec-
trode plates, we determined the droplet proﬁles of liq-
uid bridges by numerically solving the Young-Laplace
equation. In this Communication we furthermore showed
that the area enclosed in the charge-voltage representa-
tion (q, Vcap) during the steady state of the charging-
discharging cycle equals the work harvested by the en-
gine. This gives a graphic interpretation to work maxi-
mization, where the optimal operating regime of the en-
gine is characterized by the largest enclosed areas in this
representation.

Varying the average plate separation we found two op-
posing trends: the engine without external battery power
[13, 14] thrives at large average plate separation, to be
contrasted with the externally-driven droplet engine of
Ref. [4] which thrives at small average plate separation.
We found that both engines beneﬁt from a large oscil-
lation amplitude, in accordance with the experimental
ﬁndings of Ref. [13] and [14]. Explicitly treating surface
roughness, to impose pinning of the contact line, is ap-
parently non-essential, since the symmetry between top
and bottom electrode can also be broken by gravity and
diﬀerent contact angles rather than diﬀerent surface het-
erogeneities. However, further work could still include
a more systematic treatment of these heterogeneities, to
investigate for example the slipping of the contact line.
Also, the onset of hydrodynamic eﬀects at high frequency
oscillations remains poorly understood.

Our main ﬁnding however is that the work and power
output of the engine beneﬁt substantially from impos-
ing a time-dependent bias potential. More speciﬁcally, a
square-wave battery driving, with an appropriate phase
shift with respect to the mechanical driving, leads to
quantitative enhancement (by a factor of order 2-5) at
high oscillation frequencies, and even to a qualitative en-
hancement (by several orders of magnitude) at low fre-
quencies, with a non-vanishing work output in this low-
frequency regime. We found that a sinusoidal applied
potential leads to similar conclusions. Moreover, an op-
timum was found at ∆V /V0 = 1, an analytic result that
is supported by numerics. We hope that this inspires
new experiments to further explore the enhanced conver-
sion of vibrational energy into electric work by a suitably
tuned driving.

to have a maximum W (ω = 1/RC) = 1

the same frequency.

Variable capacitance RC-circuit

The analytic solution Krupenkin and Taylor [4] present
for the case of constant potential V (t) = V0 with a sinu-
soidally varying capacitance Ct/b(t) = C0(1+cos ωt), can
be found by plugging in into eqn (S1). However, for the
liquid bridge engine we are interested in, this expression
for the capacitance is not correct since a vanishing ca-
pacitance would imply a broken bridge.

The Kirchoﬀ equation eqn (4) is brought in dimen-

Cb/t(t) = Cb/t(0) ˆCb/t(t) and Ctot = C0 ˆCtot, and V (t) =

The square wave driving gives a trapezoidal enclosed

area such that the harvested work amounts to

The charges can be expressed as Q1 = VlCl, Q2 = VlCh,
Q3 = VhCh, and Q4 = VhCh with l low and h high.
Combining gives

Wω→0 = (Vl (Ch − Cl) + Vh (Ch − Cl)) ∆V
