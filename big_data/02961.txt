Abstract

Periodic travelling waves are considered in the class of reduced Ostrovsky equations that
describe low-frequency internal waves in the presence of rotation. The reduced Ostrovsky
equations with either quadratic or cubic nonlinearities can be transformed to integrable equa-
tions of the Klein–Gordon type by means of a change of coordinates. By using the conserved
momentum and energy as well as an additional conserved quantity due to integrability, we
prove that small-amplitude periodic waves are orbitally stable with respect to subharmonic
perturbations, with period equal to an integer multiple of the period of the wave. The proof
is based on construction of a Lyapunov functional, which is convex at the periodic wave and
is conserved in the time evolution. We also show numerically that convexity of the Lyapunov
functional holds for periodic waves of arbitrary amplitudes.

Introduction

The Ostrovsky equation with the quadratic nonlinearity was originally derived by L.A. Ostrovsky
[31] to model small-amplitude long waves in a rotating ﬂuid of ﬁnite depth. The same model was
extended to include the cubic nonlinearities in the context of the internal gravity waves [19, 21].
We consider the class of reduced Ostrovsky equations, for which the high-frequency disper-
sion is neglected. In particular, we are interested in the models with either quadratic or cubic
nonlinearities. When a suitable scaling is selected, the two diﬀerent evolution equations can be
written in the normalized forms

(ut + uux)x = u

(1.1)

and

(1.2)
where u(x, t); R × R → R. The modiﬁed reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.2) can be considered as

The short-pulse equation was derived in [11, 35, 33] in the context of propagation of ultra-short
pulses with few cycles on the pulse width.

Local solutions of the Cauchy problem associated with the class of reduced Ostrovsky equa-
tions exist in the space H s(R) ∩ ˙H−1(R) for s > 3
2 [36]. For the suﬃciently large initial data,
the local solutions break in a ﬁnite time, similar to the inviscid Burgers equation with quadratic
or cubic nonlinearities [26, 27]. However, if the initial data u0 is small in a suitable norm, then
local solutions are continued for all times in the same space. For the quadratic equation (1.1),
the global solutions exist if u0 ∈ H 3(R) with 1 − 3u(cid:48)(cid:48)
0(x) > 0 for every x ∈ R [20, 22]. For the
0(x)| < 1 for every x ∈ R
cubic equation (1.2), the global solutions exist if u0 ∈ H 2(R) with |u(cid:48)
[14, 32].

This work is devoted to the orbital stability analysis of periodic travelling waves of the reduced
Ostrovsky equations (1.1) and (1.2). Periodic travelling waves can be found in the explicit form
of the Jacobi elliptic functions, after a change of coordinates [20]. Alternatively, the periodic
waves can be characterized as critical points of the conserved energy [3]. If the periodic waves are
constrained minimizers of energy with respect to the perturbations of the same period subject to
the ﬁxed conserved momentum, then they are orbitally stable with respect to such perturbations
(see, e.g., the recent works [4, 5, 15, 24, 28, 29]).

Unfortunately, the periodic waves are not typically constrained minimizers of energy with
respect to perturbations with period equal to an integer multiple of the wave period (such per-
turbations are called subharmonic). It becomes therefore diﬃcult (if not impossible) to prove
the nonlinear orbital stability of periodic waves with respect to subharmonic perturbations even
if the spectral stability of the periodic waves is established (e.g., by computing numerically the
Floquet–Bloch spectrum of the linearization at the periodic wave).

However, the reduced Ostrovsky equations (1.1) and (1.2) can be transformed to the integrable
equations of the Klein–Gordon type with a change of coordinates [20, 14]. As a result, these
evolution equations have a bi-inﬁnite sequence of conserved quantities beyond the conserved
energy and momentum. By combining several conserved quantities in a linear combination,
one can try obtaining a conserved quantity, for which the periodic waves are unconstrained
minimizers with respect to subharmonic perturbations. These minimizers are degenerate due
to the spatial translation symmetry, but the degeneracy can be overcome by using the spatial
translation parameter.

These ideas to obtain nonlinear orbital stability of periodic waves in integrable equations
have been developed in the works of B. Deconinck and his collaborators [6, 7, 12, 13, 30]. Using
the eigenfunctions of Lax operators arising in the inverse scattering method, a complete set
of Floquet–Bloch eigenfunctions satisfying the linearization of the integrable equations at the
periodic wave is constructed and the quadratic forms associated with the higher-order energy
functionals are computed at the Floquet–Bloch eigenfunctions. If the quadratic form for a linear
combination of the higher-order energy functionals is shown to be positive for every Floquet–Bloch
eigenfunction of the linearized integrable equation, then one can conjecture that the corresponding
energy functional can be used as the Lyapunov function in the proof of the orbital stability of
unconstrained minimizers. In such a way, the nonlinear orbital stability of periodic waves with
respect to subharmonic perturbations was obtained for the Korteweg–de Vries [6, 30, 12], modiﬁed
Korteweg–de Vries [13], and the defocusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger [7] equations.

In the recent work [16], the proof of nonlinear orbital stability was revisited for the periodic
waves in the defocusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. In particular, it was proven rigorously
that the periodic waves are unconstrained minimizers for a linear combination of two natural
energy functionals, one of which is deﬁned in H 1 and the other one is deﬁned in H 2. Compared
to the work [7], the proof was developed directly for the Hessian operators associated with the

2

higher-order Lyapunov functional. Positivity of the corresponding quadratic form is proved for
small-amplitude periodic waves by means of the perturbation theory and for large-amplitude
periodic waves by means of new factorization identities for the defocusing NLS equation and a
continuation argument.

In this work, we extend the nonlinear orbital stability analysis to the class of reduced Ostro-
vsky equations, which include the integrable equations (1.1) and (1.2). Similarly to the scopes
of [16], we would like to work with a linear combination of two energy functionals, one of which
is the energy of the reduced Ostrovsky equations deﬁned in H−1 ∩ Lp space with p = 3 for (1.1)
and p = 4 for (1.2). The other energy functional is a subject of the free will. For instance, we
could look at the higher-order energy deﬁned in a subset of H−2 space or the higher-order energy
deﬁned in H s with s = 3 for (1.1) or s = 2 for (1.2). However, we will show that the Casimir-
type functional, which is the main building block for integrability of the corresponding equations
[9, 10], is suﬃcient for the construction of the Lyapunov functional for the periodic wave. The
second variation of the Lyapunov functional is positive for the H s ∩ H−1 perturbations to the
periodic wave with s = 2 for (1.1) and s = 1 for (1.2), thus providing stability of the periodic
waves in the reduced Ostrovsky equations (1.1) and (1.2).

We prove the main result for the small-amplitude periodic waves, when computations are
performed by the perturbation theory and do not require a heavy use of integrability technique.
We also show numerically that convexity of the Lyapunov functional extend to the periodic
waves of larger amplitudes until the terminal amplitude is reached, where the periodic wave
proﬁle becomes piecewise smooth.

The paper is organized as follows. The conserved quantities and the main stability result for
the reduced Ostrovsky equations are described in Section 2 for (1.1) and in Section 3 for (1.2).
The general proof of positivity of a linear combination of two energy functionals for the small-
amplitude periodic waves is developed in Section 4, where applications of the general method to
the two integrable equations (1.1) and (1.2) are also given. Section 5 reports numerical results
for the periodic waves of arbitrary amplitudes. In the concluding Section 6, we discuss how the
stability analysis based on higher-order conserved quantities fails for the short-pulse equation
(1.3), where the small-amplitude periodic waves are known to be unstable with respect to side-
band modulations.

2 Main result for the reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.1)

In the context of the reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.1), we deﬁne travelling periodic wave solutions
and conserved quantities, compute the second variation of the energy functional at the periodic
wave proﬁle, and present the main result on positivity of the second variation for a certain linear
combination of the energy functionals.

2.1 Travelling waves

Travelling 2L-periodic solutions of the reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.1) can be expressed in the
normalized form

where U (z) is a 2π-periodic solution of the second-order diﬀerential equation

+ U (z) = 0,

(2.2)

and the parameter γ is proportional to the wave speed. Note that the 2π-periodic function U
satisfying (2.2) has the zero mean value. By the translational invariance and reversibility of the
diﬀerential equation (2.2), U can be selected to be an even function of z.

The second-order equation (2.2) can be integrated with the ﬁrst-order invariant

The following result deﬁnes a family of the 2π-periodic even solutions U of the diﬀerential equation
(2.2) in the small-amplitude limit.
Lemma 2.1. For every γ > 1 such that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, there exists a unique 2π-
periodic, even, smooth solution U , which can be parameterized by the amplitude parameter a, such
that

(2.5)

(2.6)

Proof. Justiﬁcation of the asymptotic expansions (2.4), (2.5), and (2.6) and the proof of existence
of the 2π-periodic even solutions U of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) can be achieved by the
standard method of Lyapunov–Schmidt reductions, see, e.g., the proof of Proposition 2.1 in [16].
The solution U is smooth both in variables z and a because the diﬀerential equation (2.2) is
smooth in U and the wave proﬁle satisﬁes U (z) < γ for every z ∈ R and for small amplitudes a.
The representation (2.4) is typically referred to as the Stokes expansion of a small-amplitude
periodic wave. Since the period of the periodic wave has been normalized to 2π, the parameter a
of the wave amplitude also parameterize the wave speed γ > 1 and the ﬁrst-order invariant I > 0
according to the asymptotic expansions (2.5) and (2.6).

Computations of the coeﬃcients in the expansions (2.4), (2.5), and (2.6) are straightforward

and hence omitted.

Remark 2.2. In the statement of Lemma 2.1 and further on, we will use the following notations,
which are typical in the asymptotic analysis. If I depends smoothly on the small parameter a,
then I = O(a2) means that the limit I/a2 as a → 0 exists. Similarly, if U ∈ C∞
per is a 2π-periodic
smooth function that also depends smoothly on the small parameter a, then U = OC∞
per(a2) means
that the limit supz∈[0,2π] |U (n)(z)|/a2 as a → 0 exists for every n ∈ Z (the limiting value as a → 0
may depend on n).

Remark 2.3. The 2π-periodic solution of the second-order equation (2.2) can be expressed in the
closed analytical form by using a change of coordinates [20]. The transformation is given by

(cid:90) ζ

U (z) = u(ζ),

z =

(γ − u(ζ(cid:48)))dζ(cid:48),

where u satisﬁes the following second-order equation

0

d2u

dζ 2 + (γ − u)u = 0.

(2.7)

(2.8)

The latter equation arises for travelling waves of the KdV equation and it admits explicit solutions
for periodic waves given by the Jacobi elliptic cn functions [20]. The family of 2π-periodic smooth
solutions of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) exists in variables U and z as long as the transformation
(2.7) is invertible, that is, as long as u(ζ) < γ for every ζ.

Remark 2.4. It follows from the recent work in [17, 18] that the amplitude-to-period map for
the diﬀerential equations (2.2) and (2.3) is strictly monotonically increasing. With the scaling
transformation, this result can be used to prove monotonicity of the parameters γ and I in terms
of the wave amplitude a, which are expanded asymptotically as a → 0 by (2.5) and (2.6).
[20]. As γ → π2

Remark 2.5. The periodic wave with proﬁle U exists for every γ ∈(cid:16)

periodic wave is no longer smooth at the end points of the fundamental period. In variables U
and z, the limiting wave has the parabolic proﬁle:

From the ﬁrst-order invariant (2.3) at the solutions of the second-order equation (2.2), we deduce
that

The 2π-periodic solution U of the second-order equation (2.2) with γ ∈ (cid:16)

where the integration is extended over the wave period and ∂−1
x denotes the zero-mean anti-
derivative of the function u. Writing all the integrals in the normalized variable z and neglecting
the scaling factors (which is equivalent to the choice L = π), we consider the ﬁrst energy functional
in the form

Sγ(u) := E(u) − γQ(u).

(2.13)

The following result establishes equivalence between the Euler–Lagrange equations for Sγ and
the second-order diﬀerential equation (2.2). The result is proved by a non-trivial adaptation of
the variational calculus in the space of 2π-periodic functions with zero mean.

Similarly, we expand

where C0 (cid:54)= 0. Expanding Sγ(U +v)−Sγ(U ) to the linear order in v and using Parseval’s equality,
we obtain the ﬁrst variation of Sγ, denoted by δSγ, in the explicit form

Although C0 (cid:54)= 0, it does not enter to the ﬁrst variation δSγ. The Euler–Lagrange equations for

2n−2An − 2γAn + Cn = 0,

2n−2Bn − 2γBn + Dn = 0, n ∈ N.

(2.15)

Note that these equations are not equivalent to the integral equation

U (U − 2γ) − 2∂−2

z U = 0,

because the mean value of U 2 is nonzero. They are, however, equivalent to the equation

which is well-deﬁned in L2
per,zero. Equation (2.17) is nothing but the derivative
of (2.16) in z. By bootstrapping arguments, if U (z) < γ for every z ∈ R, then the solution U is
actually smooth in z. Hence, equation (2.17) can be diﬀerentiated with respect to z, after which
it becomes the second-order diﬀerential equation (2.2). Thus, the equivalence is established in
one direction.

In the opposite direction, if U is a 2π-periodic smooth solution of the diﬀerential equation
per. Then, working backwards

(2.2), then it has zero mean and belongs to the space L2
from (2.2) to (2.17), (2.16), and (2.15), we obtain δSγ = 0 for every perturbation in L2

Let us now consider the other conserved quantities of the reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.1)
[10, 22]. If u ∈ H 3 with 1 − 3uxx ≥ F0 > 0 for every x ∈ R and some constant F0, then the
reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.1) has conserved higher-order energy given by

as well as the conserved Casimir-type functional

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

H(u) =

(uxxx)2

(1 − 3uxx)7/3

dx,

C(u) =

(1 − 3uxx)1/3dx.

(2.18)

(2.19)

The conserved quantity C(u) is a mass integral associated to the quantity f := (1−3uxx)1/3, which
determines the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation that brings the reduced Ostrovsky
equation to the integrable Klein–Gordon-type equation [10, 20, 22].

Let us deﬁne the second energy functional in the form

RΓ(u) := C(u) − ΓQ(u),

(2.20)

where parameter Γ should be chosen in such a way that the same periodic wave U given by
solution of the second-order equation (2.2) becomes a critical point of RΓ(u) in function space
H s
2 (so that uzz is a bounded and continuous function by Sobolev’s embedding).
The following lemma speciﬁed the proper deﬁnition of Γ.

Lemma 2.7. The set of 2π-periodic smooth solutions U of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) such

(2.21)

where γ3 − 6I > 0.

Proof. The Euler–Lagrange equation for RΓ(u) is given by the fourth-order diﬀerential equation

(1 − 3u(cid:48)(cid:48))u(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) + 5(u(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48))2 + Γu(1 − 3u(cid:48)(cid:48))8/3 = 0.

(2.22)

7

Solutions to equation (2.22) are smooth in z as long as 1 − 3u(cid:48)(cid:48)(z) > 0 for every z ∈ R. Diﬀeren-
tiating (2.2) for smooth solutions U , we obtain

(γ − U )U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) = −U(cid:48)(1 − 3U(cid:48)(cid:48))

(2.23)

and

(γ − U )U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) = −U(cid:48)(cid:48)(1 − 3U(cid:48)(cid:48)) + 4U(cid:48)U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48).

(2.24)
Also recall from (2.11) that if U (z) < γ and 1 − 3U(cid:48)(cid:48)(z) > 0 for every z ∈ R, then γ3 − 6I > 0.
Substituting (2.11), (2.23), and (2.24) to equation (2.22) for u = U , we obtain the identity if and
only if Γ is given by (2.21).

2.3 Second variation of the energy functionals

The 2π-periodic solution U of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) is a critical point of either the
standard energy functional Sγ(u) or the alternative energy functional RΓ(u) given by (2.13) or
(2.20) respectively, see Lemmas 2.1, 2.6, and 2.7. In order to study extremal properties of the
energy functionals at U , we shall study their second variation at U in appropriate function spaces.
per,zero to the periodic wave U and expanding Sγ(U + v) − Sγ(U )
to the quadratic order in v, we obtain the second variation of Sγ, denoted by δ2Sγ, in the explicit
form

The domain of the integral depends on the properties of the perturbation v. In what follows, we
assume that v is periodic with the period 2πN for an integer N , so that L2
per,zero denotes now
the space of square integrable 2πN -periodic functions with the zero mean value.

Since the ﬁrst term of δ2Sγ is positive and the second term is negative, the sign of δ2Sγ is

not generally deﬁned. In order to characterize δ2Sγ, we write (2.25) as the quadratic form

δ2Sγ = (cid:104)Lγv, v(cid:105)L2,

proof of Lemma 2.6. The following lemma characterizes the spectrum of the self-adjoint operator
Lγ in space L2
Lemma 2.8. For every integer N ≥ 1 and every γ > 1 such that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, the

the nonzero eigenvalues split generally but remain in the negative domain, as it follows from the
perturbation theory for compact operators under bounded perturbations. In particular, if A()
is an analytic family of self-adjoint operators and if the spectrum of A(0) is separated into two
parts, then this remains true also for A() with  suﬃciently small (see Theorem VII.1.7 in [25]).
The zero eigenvalue splits generally if γ (cid:54)= 1, but one eigenvalue remains at zero because of
the translational invariance of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) resulting in the relation LγU(cid:48) = 0
. Therefore, we only need to check what happens with the other
eigenvalue bifurcating from zero if a (cid:54)= 0. This is done with the regular perturbation expansions.

hence, the zero eigenvalue associated with the even eigenfunction V0 for a = 0 becomes positive
eigenvalue for nonzero but small values of a. This proves the assertion of the lemma for N = 1.
From the explicit representation (2.28) for a = 0, we realize that there are additional 2(N − 1)
positive eigenvalues of Lγ=1 if N ≥ 2 (counting with their multiplicity). These positive eigenvalues
remain positive for nonzero but small values of a. In addition, the perturbation expansions (2.29),
(2.30), and (2.31). show that an additional positive eigenvalue of Lγ bifurcates from zero for any
N ≥ 1. The assertion of the lemma is proved.

Remark 2.9. The result of Lemma 2.8 is typical for periodic waves. For N = 1, the positive
eigenvalue can be removed under the constraint that the perturbation v does not change the
momentum functional Q(u) = (cid:107)u(cid:107)2

L2. As a result, one can use −Sγ as a Lyapunov functional

9

in the proof of orbital stability of the periodic waves with respect to the perturbations of the
same period [3]. The constraint is used to specify a varying wave speed as a function of time. In
addition, one needs to introduce a varying parameter of spatial translation as a function of time
to remove the degeneracy of the quadratic form at the zero eigenvalue of Lγ.
On the other hand, for N ≥ 2, the additional positive eigenvalues of Lγ cannot be removed by
one constraint on the momentum functional Q, so that −Sγ can not be chosen as the Lyapunov
functional in the proof of orbital stability of the periodic waves with respect to the subharmonic
perturbations.

(2.20). Using a perturbation v ∈ H 2
RΓ(U ) to the quadratic order in v, we obtain

Let us now inspect the second variation of the alternative energy functional RΓ(u) given by

The following lemma characterizes the spectrum of Mγ given by (2.34).
Lemma 2.10. For every integer N ≥ 1 and every γ > 1 such that |γ− 1| is suﬃciently small, the
per,zero consists of 2N − 2 positive eigenvalues (counted by their multiplicity),
spectrum of Mγ in L2
a simple zero eigenvalue, and an inﬁnite number of negative eigenvalues.

Proof. For a = 0, γ = 1, I = 0, and U (z) = 0, the spectrum of Mγ=1 in L2
sequence of double eigenvalues

per,zero consists of a

a = 0 :

(2.35)

MγU(cid:48) = 0 that holds for every γ ∈ (cid:16)

If N = 1, all double eigenvalues but one are negative and the only remaining eigenvalue is zero.
The zero eigenvalue splits again, but one eigenvalue remains at zero because of the exact relation
. Indeed, using (2.11), we check that MγU(cid:48) = 0 is

(cid:17)

equivalent to the diﬀerential equation

−∂2

z (γ − U )5U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) + (γ3 − 6I)U(cid:48) = 0.

Integrating once with zero mean and using (2.23), we obtain the diﬀerential equation

∂z(γ − U )4(1 − 3U(cid:48)(cid:48))U(cid:48) + (γ3 − 6I)U = 0,

which is equivalent to the diﬀerential equation (2.2) due to the identity (2.11).

Let us now show that the zero eigenvalue of Mγ=1 associated with the even function V0(z) =
cos(z) at a = 0 becomes negative for nonzero but small values of a. This is done by the regular
perturbation expansions. We expand the operator Mγ in powers of a:

We are looking for the perturbation expansion starting with the eigenfunction V0 = cos(z):

(2.36)
where corrections V1,2 are uniquely deﬁned under the orthogonality constraints (cid:104)V0, V1,2(cid:105)L2 = 0.
At the linear order in a, we obtain

(2.38)
hence, the assertion of the lemma is proved for N = 1. The proof for N ≥ 2 is similar to that of
Lemma 2.8.
Remark 2.11. Compared to the functional −Sγ, periodic waves are unconstrained minimizers of
the functional −RΓ with respect to perturbations of the same period. Therefore, −RΓ can be
used as a Lyapunov functional in the proof of orbital stability of periodic waves and the only
varying parameter of spatial translation is needed to remove the degeneracy of the quadratic form
for the zero eigenvalue of Mγ, see, e.g., the proof of Theorem 1.8 in [16].

2.4 Positivity of a linear combination of the second variations δ2Sγ and δ2RΓ

From Lemmas 2.8 and 2.10, we can see that properties of the operator Mγ are similar to those
of the operator Lγ with the exception of one small eigenvalue, which is positive for Lγ and
negative for Mγ. Let us deﬁne the Lyapunov functional by a linear combination of the two
energy functionals Sγ(u) and RΓ(u) given by (2.13) and (2.20) respectively:

Λc,γ(u) := Sγ(u) − cRΓ(u),

(2.39)
where c ∈ R is a parameter to be deﬁned within an appropriate interval. The energy function
Λc,γ(u) is deﬁned for u ∈ H s
2 . By Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7, the 2π-periodic smooth
solution U of the diﬀerential equation (2.2) is a critical point of Λc,γ for every c ∈ R. The second
variation of Λc,γ, denoted by δ2Λc,γ, is deﬁned for the perturbation v in H 2
per,zero, which may have
period 2πN for an integer N .

per,zero with s > 5

The following result shows that the second variation δ2Λc,γ=1 is positive for a particular value

of the parameter c.

11

Lemma 2.12. δ2Λc,γ=1 ≥ 0 for every v ∈ H 2

per,zero and every N ≥ 1 if and only if c = 1
2 .
Proof. We substitute a = 0, γ = 1, I = 0, and U (z) = 0 in (2.25) and (2.32) and obtain

(cid:90) (cid:2)(∂−1

z v)2(cid:3) dz.

a = 0 :

δ2Λc,γ=1 =

z v)2 − (1 + c)v2 + c(∂2

(2.40)

The second variation δ2Λc,γ=1 is well-deﬁned for v ∈ H 2
per,zero, e.g., in the space of 2πN -periodic
functions with zero mean for an integer N . To deal with every integer N , we are looking for the
values of c, for which δ2Λc,γ=1 ≥ 0 for every v ∈ H 2(R) ∩ ˙H−1(R).
By the Fourier transform on the line, the problem of determining if δ2Λc,γ=1 ≥ 0 in (2.40) is

identical to the problem of ﬁnding c for which

Dc(k) := ck4 − (1 + c) + k−2 ≥ 0,

k ∈ R.

The values c = 0 and c < 0 do not provide positivity of Dc(k) as |k| → ∞. Therefore, we consider
c > 0 only.
Since D(cid:48)

c =
c (k) = 12ck2 + 6k−4 > 0, the critical points of Dc at k = ±kc are the points of

F (c) := Dc(kc) = ck4

c − (1 + c) + k−2

c =

c1/3 − 1 − c.

22/3

We are looking for the values of c for which F (c) ≥ 0, so that Dc(k) ≥ 0 for all k ∈ R. Since
F (cid:48)(c) = (2c)−2/3 − 1, the only critical point of F occurs at c0 = 1
2 . Since F (cid:48)(cid:48)(c) < 0, c0 is the
point of maximum of F , for which we have F (c0) = 0. Therefore, F (c) ≤ 0 and the only possible
value of c for which Dc(k) ≥ 0 for every k ∈ R is the value c = c0 = 1
2 . Indeed, in this case, we
can factorize the dispersion relation in the form

By a perturbation argument, we shall verify that δ2Λc,γ remains nonnegative for every γ such
that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, provided the parameter c is close enough to c0. Although δ2Λc,γ
due to the translational symmetry, we will
show that the zero eigenvalue is simple and δ2Λc,γ > 0 if v ∈ H 2

to U(cid:48), provided that |γ − 1| and |c − c0| are suﬃciently small. The following theorem represents

3 Main result for the modiﬁed reduced Ostrovsky equation (1.2)

to be an even function of z. The following lemma reports an analogue of Lemma 2.1. The proof
is similar, so it will be omitted.
Lemma 3.1. For every γ > 1 such that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, there exists a unique 2π-
periodic, even, smooth solution U , which can be parameterized by the amplitude parameter a, such

The latter equation arises for travelling waves of the modiﬁed KdV equation and it admits explicit
solutions for periodic waves given by the Jacobi elliptic sn functions. The family of 2π-periodic
waves exists in variables U and z as long as the transformation (3.7) is invertible, that is, as long
as |u(ζ)| <

so that the ﬁrst energy functional Sγ(u) can be considered in the same form (2.13). The periodic
wave proﬁle U satisfying the diﬀerential equation (3.2) is a critical point of the energy functional
Sγ(u). The proof is similar to the one in Lemma 2.6.

Let us deﬁne the second energy functional RΓ(u) by the same expression (2.20). The functional

(3.16)

Substituting the second and ﬁrst derivatives from (3.2) and (3.11) to equation (3.16) with u = U ,
we obtain an identity if and only if Γ is given by (3.15).

3.3 Second variation of the energy functionals
Adding a perturbation v ∈ L2

As previously, we assume that v is the 2πN -periodic function with zero mean, where N is a
positive integer. The second variation δ2Sγ is sign-indeﬁnite, because the ﬁrst term of δ2Sγ is
positive and the second term is negative.

15

Similarly, adding a perturbation v ∈ H 1

The following two lemmas report analogues of Lemmas 2.8 and 2.10.
Lemma 3.5. For every integer N ≥ 1 and every γ > 1 such that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, the
per,zero consists of 2N − 1 positive eigenvalues (counted by their multiplicity),
spectrum of Lγ in L2
a simple zero eigenvalue, and an inﬁnite number of negative eigenvalues.

Proof. For a = 0, γ = 1 and U (z) = 0, the spectrum of Lγ=1 is given by the same formula (2.28)
as in the proof of Lemma 2.8. Therefore, it is only necessary to develop the regular perturbation
theory for the splitting of the double zero eigenvalue as a (cid:54)= 0. We expand the operator Lγ in
powers of a:

Lγ = −∂−2

Since the OL2
starting with the eigenfunction V0 = cos(z) is shorter than in the case of Lemma 2.8:

hence, the zero eigenvalue of Lγ=1 associated with the even eigenfunction V0 for a = 0 becomes
a positive eigenvalue of Lγ for nonzero but small values of a.
Lemma 3.6. For every integer N ≥ 1 and every γ > 1 such that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, the
per,zero consists of 2N − 2 positive eigenvalues (counted by their multiplicity),
spectrum of Mγ in L2
a simple zero eigenvalue, and an inﬁnite number of negative eigenvalues.

double zero eigenvalue. We expand the operator Mγ in powers of a:

a negative eigenvalue of Mγ for nonzero but small values of a.

3.4 Positivity of a linear combination of the second variations δ2Sγ and δ2RΓ

Let us deﬁne the Lyapunov functional Λc,γ(u) by using the same linear combination (2.39) of
the energy functionals Sγ(u) and RΓ(u) given by (2.13) and (2.20), where parameter c ∈ R is
to be deﬁned within an appropriate interval. The second variation of Λc,γ, denoted by δ2Λc,γ, is
deﬁned for the perturbation v in H 1

4 Floquet–Bloch bands for periodic waves of small amplitudes

We consider the second variation of the Lyapunov functional Λc,γ deﬁned by (2.39) at the periodic
wave proﬁle U for nonzero but small amplitude parameter a. In order to prove positivity of δ2Λc,γ
and thus to prove Theorems 2.13 and 3.8, we develop a general perturbation method, which is
applied to both versions of the reduced Ostrovsky equations.

4.1 General perturbation method
We are interested to characterize the spectrum of the linear operator Kc,γ := Lγ−cMγ in L2
per,zero
with the domain Xper,zero ⊂ L2
per,zero, where the linear operators Lγ and Mγ deﬁne the quadratic
forms (2.26) and (2.33). The parameter c ∈ R is to be deﬁned within an appropriate interval.
Here L2
per,zero denotes the space of 2πN -periodic functions with zero mean, where N is a positive
integer, whereas Xper,zero is the domain of the linear operator Kc,γ given by a Sobolev space
per,zero for some s ≥ 0. In order to obtain results uniformly in N , we consider the Floquet–
H s
Bloch spectrum of Kc,γ in L2(R) with the domain X(R) ⊂ L2(R).
By construction, Kc,γ is a self-adjoint operator in L2(R) with 2π-periodic coeﬃcients. By
the Floquet–Bloch theory, we look for 2π-periodic Bloch wave functions w(·, κ) ∈ Xper with the

quasi-momentum parameter κ deﬁned in the Brillouin zone T =(cid:2)− 1

(cid:3) such that

eiκzw(z, κ) ∈ L∞(R) ∩ Xloc(R)

is an eigenfunction of Kc,γ for an eigenvalue λ(κ). We say that λ(κ) belongs to the Floquet–Bloch
spectrum of Kc,γ in L2(R). Both w(z, κ) and λ(κ) depend also on parameters c and γ but we
neglect listing this dependence explicitly.

Let us further postulate the Stokes expansion for the periodic wave proﬁle U in the normalized

form:

U (z) = a cos(z) + a2 ˜Ua(z),

γ = 1 + a2˜γa,

where ˜Ua is an even 2π-periodic function such that (cid:104)cos(·), ˜Ua(cid:105)L2
a → 0, whereas a2˜γa = O(a2) as a → 0.

The operator P (0)

countable family of real eigenvalues {λ(0)

exist two unperturbed Floquet–Bloch bands, which touch zero at κ = 0 as convex functions, if
c = c0, whereas all other bands are bounded away from zero by a positive number, see, e.g., the
results of Lemmas 2.12 and 3.7.
n (κ) ≥ 0 for all n ∈ Z and
Assumption 4.1. There exists c0 such that for c = c0, we have λ(0)
all κ ∈ T. Moreover, there exist exactly two bands λ(0)±1(κ) which are smooth functions in κ and
behave like

where λ(cid:48)(cid:48)(0) > 0. Furthermore, there exists C > 0 such that

λ(0)±1(κ) =

(4.3)

(4.4)

By translational symmetry, we know that Pc,γ(0)U(cid:48) = 0 for every c ∈ R and every γ such
that |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small, see, e.g., the proofs of Lemmas 2.8 and 2.10. As a result, there
exists at least one Floquet–Bloch band of Pc,γ(κ) that touches zero at κ = 0 for every c and γ.
The other zero eigenvalue of Kc,γ = Pc,γ(0) exists at a = 0 but is supposed to shift to a small
positive number for nonzero but small a, according to the following assumption.
Assumption 4.2. For every c such that |c− c0| is suﬃciently small, there exists two eigenvalues
of Kc,γ = Pc,γ(0) in L2
per in the neighborhood of zero. One eigenvalue is identically zero for
every small nonzero a, whereas the other eigenvalue λ(a, c) is strictly positive and satisﬁes the
asymptotic expansion

(4.5)
where λ2(c) is smooth in c with λ2(c0) > 0, whereas ˜λ(a, c) is smooth in (a, c) and bounded as
a → 0 and c → c0.

λ(a, c) = λ2(c)a2 + a3˜λ(a, c),

Let Wa be the eigenfunction of Kc,γ for the zero eigenvalue, which is independent of c. Let
Va,c be the eigenfunction of Kc,γ for the eigenvalue λ(a, c) given by (4.5) in Assumption 4.2. From
the Stokes expansion (4.1), we can set the normalized eigenfunctions to the form

Wa(z) := −a−1U(cid:48)(z) = sin(z) + a ˜Wa(z),

Va,c(z) = cos(z) + a ˜Va,c(z),

(4.6)

19

where the correction terms ˜Wa and ˜Va,c are uniquely deﬁned and bounded in L2
c → c0. Finally, we assume a technical non-degeneracy condition.
Assumption 4.3. Besides Pc,γ(0)Wa = 0 and Pc,γ(0)Va,c = λ(a, c)Va,c, we have

per as a → 0 and

c,γ(0)Wa = −iµ1(c − c0) cos(z) + aFc(z) + a2Ga,c(z),
P (cid:48)

and

c,γ(0)Va,c = iµ1(c − c0) sin(z) + a ˜Fc(z) + a2 ˜Ga,c(z),

per as a → 0 and c → c0.
L2
Under Assumptions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, we obtain a suﬃcient condition that the two bands in
Assumption 4.1 separate from each other for nonzero but small values of a. If c is selected near
c0, one band still touches the origin at κ = 0 while the other one remains strictly positive for
all κ ∈ T, with both bands remaining convex functions of κ. The following proposition gives the
general result.

Proposition 4.4. Consider expansion (4.2) of the self-adjoint operator Pc,γ(κ) for suﬃciently
small amplitude a and assume that Assumptions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 are true. Then, for every c
satisfying |c − c0| ≤ C|a|, where C is a positive a-independent constant, the two lowest spectral
bands of the operator Pc,γ(κ) denoted by λgr(κ) and λex(κ) satisfy the asymptotic expansions

(4.10)

Proof. From (4.4) we know that, if |c − c0| is suﬃciently small, there exists a constant C > 0
(independent of c) such that

(cid:104)

(cid:105)−1 ≤ C for all n ∈ Z \ {+1,−1} and all κ ∈ T.

(4.11)

By the regular perturbation theory, this bound remains true (with possibly a larger constant C)
for all the perturbed spectral bands with n (cid:54)= ±1 if a and |c− c0| are small enough. For the other
two spectral bands in (4.3), the same perturbation argument shows that they are bounded away
from zero if |κ| ≥ κ0 for a and |c−c0| being suﬃciently small, where κ0 > 0 is ﬁxed independently
of a. It remains to study the two spectral bands near κ = 0.

To simplify details, we consider each spectral band λ± separately from each other. At the ﬁrst
glance, this approach does not look justiﬁed because the kernel of Pc=c0,γ=1(0) is two-dimensional.
However, due to Assumption 4.2, the double zero eigenvalue is broken into two simple eigenvalues

20

of Pc=c0,γ for every γ such that γ − 1 = O(a2) is suﬃciently small. Therefore, we can proceed
with the perturbation expansions in κ, which are singular as a → 0 if κ (cid:54)= 0 is ﬁxed independently
of a. However, if κ is as small as O(a2), all terms of the asymptotic expansions (4.9) and (4.10)
are controlled in the limit a → 0.

First, we derive the expansion (4.9) formally. Since Pc,γ(0)Wa = 0, we consider the following

expansion for the band λgr(κ) that touches the zero eigenvalue:

λgr(κ) = Λ1κ + Λ2κ2 + O(κ3), w(z, κ) = Wa(z) + κW1(z) + κ2W2(z) + OL2

equation

c,γ(0)Wa = Λ1Wa.

(4.13)

We note that P (cid:48)

c,γ(0) = iQc,γ, where Qc,γ := Kc,γz − zKc,γ is skew-adjoint in L2

port justiﬁcation of the expansion (4.9). Using scaling λgr(κ) = κ2Λ, we substitute the orthogonal

Corollary 4.5. It follows from the asymptotic expansions (4.9) and (4.10) of Proposition 4.4
that the self-adjoint operator Kc,γ is positive if c ∈ (c−, c+), where c± satisfy the asymptotic

Remark 4.6. Note that the proof of Proposition 4.4 does not rely on the Lyapunov–Schmidt
method applied to the two-dimensional kernel of P (0)
per,
compared to the one used in the recent work [16]. Although the same two-dimensional Lyapunov–
Schmidt method applies relatively easy for the case of cubic nonlinearities, where the terms of
the order O(a2) are missing in the Stokes expansion (3.4), the method becomes messy and
requires an additional near-identity transformation for the case of quadratic nonlinearities, which
is associated with the Stokes expansion (2.4).

5 Numerical results for periodic waves of large amplitudes

Here we approximate the periodic waves and the spectral bands of the linear operators Kγ,c in
L2(R) numerically for both versions of the reduced Ostrovsky equations.

Although explicit solutions to the second-order equation (2.2) are known in the parametric
form (2.7), it is more convenient to construct the solution proﬁle U numerically. We use the
Fourier series and follow Newton-Kantorovich iterations [8]. Denote the m-th iterate for the

26

solution (U , γ) by (Um, γm) and introduce the increments (v, g), through Um+1 = Um + v,
γm+1 = γm + g. Then, at the linearized approximation, (v, g) satisfy the linear equation

(γm − Um)v(cid:48)(cid:48) − 2U(cid:48)

mv(cid:48) + (1 − U(cid:48)(cid:48)

m)v + U(cid:48)(cid:48)

mg = −[(γm − Um)U(cid:48)(cid:48)

m − (U(cid:48)

m)2 + Um].

(5.1)

This equation is solved pseudo-spectrally. The even solution U is approximated by the N -th
partial sum of the Fourier cosine series:

N(cid:88)

U (z) =

An cos(nz).

We normalize A1 = a for a given a ∈ R and select g from the orthogonality condition

n=1

(cid:104)cos(·), v(cid:105)L2

per

= 0.

(5.2)

(5.3)

Then, the value A1 = a is preserved in iterations in m. The partial sum (5.2) is evaluated at 2N
evenly spaced points on [−π, π) to give the vectors z and Um and the matrix equation

where D is the 2N × 2N Fourier diﬀerentiation matrix, I the 2N × 2N identity matrix, diag
denotes the 2N × 2N matrix with the speciﬁed diagonal, and v gives the increment at the points
z. The ﬁnal row represents the orthogonality condition (5.3) numerically.
The linear algebraic system (5.4) is solved iteratively with N = 2048 until the maximum
absolute value of each increment is less than 10−15, which always required fewer than 10 iterations.
Aliasing in the computation of products was avoided by ensuring that the coeﬃcients satisﬁed
|An| < 10−14 for n > N/4. The invariant (2.3) was found at each z to deviate from its average
value by less than 10−11, providing an independent check on the accuracy of the solutions. Figure
1 gives typical proﬁles U (z) and the corresponding coeﬃcients An. Even for the largest amplitude
of a = −0.65 considered here the coeﬃcients An are less than 10−16 for n > 300.

To discuss the eigenvalues of the operator Pc,γ(κ) given by (4.37), it is convenient to write

Pc,γ(κ) = Aγ(κ) − cBγ(κ),

(5.5)

where

Aγ(κ) = −(∂z + iκ)−2 − (γ − U ),
Bγ(κ) = (γ3 − 6I)−2/3 − (γ3 − 6I)−5/3(∂z + iκ)2(γ − U )5(∂z + iκ)2.

By discretising the linear operators in Fourier space and evaluating products pseudospectrally,
we obtain the discretised forms

(cid:99)Aγ(κ) = diag(k2
(cid:99)Bγ(κ) = (γ3 − 6I)−2/3I − (γ3 − 6I)−5/3diag(k2)F(diag(γ − U )5F−1(diag(k2)),

Figure 2 compares the computed lowest eigenvalues of the operator (5.5) for amplitudes
a = −0.1 and a = −0.2 with the spectral bands for the unperturbed operator for a = 0 at

are split, including the repeated eigenvalue at the origin. Figure 3(a) is a detail of ﬁgure 2(a) in the
neighbourhood of the origin, with the dashed lines now giving the small-κ, small-a asymptotic
expansions (4.9) and (4.10) for the ground and ﬁrst excited spectral bands with λ(cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = 12,
µ1 = 4, and λ2(c0) = 2. As predicted, the excited spectral band moves symmetrically upwards
into positive λ, with the asymptotic solution remaining accurate even at signiﬁcant base-wave
amplitudes. Figure 3(b),(c) gives the ground and excited spectral bands for a = −0.1 and c = 0.7.
In line with the expansion (4.40), the value of c is now suﬃciently large that the lowest mode
curve is concave downwards in the neighbourhood of the origin, mirrored by the appearance of
computed eigenvalues with λ negative. The accuracy of the asymptotic forms for a = −0.1 is
remarkable.

Computations for all allowable 0 < a < 0.65 and 0 < c < 0.7 show that the small κ behaviour
of the expansion (4.40) shown on ﬁgure 3 is generic. At ﬁxed a the graph of the spectral band
λgr(κ) is concave upwards as a function of κ for c ∈ (c−, c+) and concave downwards outside this
interval. Moreover this change is the ﬁrst occurrence of a negative eigenvalue for Pc,γ(κ). Thus
the boundaries c± are determined by changes in sign of λ(cid:48)(cid:48)
gr(0) = 0, it is convenient
gr(δκ) for 0 < δκ (cid:28) 1. The boundaries c± are thus

the maximum amplitude of |a| = 4/π ≈ 1.273.

6 Discussion

The short-pulse equation (1.3) can be considered as the focusing version of the modiﬁed reduced
Ostrovsky equation (1.2). The short-pulse equation (1.3) possesses the modulated pulse solutions,
which are localized in space and periodic in time [34]. These solutions can have arbitrary small
amplitude and wide localization in space, when the solution resembles modulated wave packets
governed by the focusing nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [23]. Therefore, it is natural to suspect

[37]. Although the short-pulse equation also possess higher-order conserved quantities [9, 32],
our method relying on construction of a Lyapunov-type energy functional should fail for periodic
waves in the short-pulse equation (1.3). Here we show how precisely the method fails.

Compared to the operators Lγ=1 and Mγ=1 in Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6, the operator Mγ=1 has an
inﬁnite number of positive eigenvalues and a ﬁnite number of negative eigenvalues. The splitting
of the zero eigenvalue is studied by the regular asymptotic expansion (3.19). For the operator
Lγ, we obtain λ2 = − 1
8 as in
(3.22).

4 instead of (3.20). For the operator Mγ, we still obtain λ2 = − 3

Deﬁning Λc,γ(u) := Sγ(u) + cRΓ(u) to reﬂect the change in the sign for Mγ, we obtain the
result of Lemma 3.7 for c = c0 = 2. Therefore, Assumption 4.1 is still satisﬁed. However,
expansion (4.5) of Assumption 4.2 gives now the negative eigenvalue λ(a, c) with

λ2(c) = − 2 + 3c

8

.

Therefore, one of the spectral bands of the linear operator Kc,γ := Lγ + cMγ is now negative
near κ = 0 for every small nonzero amplitude a of the periodic wave with the proﬁle U . As a
result, Λc,γ is not positive for every c ∈ R if |γ − 1| is suﬃciently small. This indicates that Λc,γ
is no longer a Lyapunov-type energy functional for the periodic waves of the short-pulse equation
(1.3), which are modulationally unstable.

31

As an open problem, we mention that the modulated pulse solutions of the short-pulse equa-
tion (1.3) are reported to be stable in numerical simulations [11, 27]. Given integrability structure
of the short-pulse equation, it may be possible to prove orbital stability of the modulated pulse
solutions analytically. A similar proof of nonlinear orbital stability of breathers in the modiﬁed
KdV equation was recently developed in [1]. However, there are technical obstacles to extend
this proof to breathers in the sine–Gordon equation [2], and hence to the short-pulse equation
(1.3), which corresponds to the sine–Gordon equation in characteristic coordinates [32].
