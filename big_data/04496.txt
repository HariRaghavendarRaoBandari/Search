ABSTRACT

Fast electron beams (FEBs) are common products of solar active phenomena.

Solar radio bursts are an important diagnostic tool in the understanding of FEBs

as well as the solar plasma environment in which they are propagating along

solar magnetic ﬁelds. In particular, the evolutions of the energy spectrum and

velocity distribution of FEBs due to the interaction with the ambient plasma and

ﬁeld when propagating can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the eﬃciency and property of

their emissions. In this paper, we discuss some possible evolutions of the energy

spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs due to the energy loss processes and

the pitch-angle eﬀect caused by the magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity, and analyze the

eﬀects of these evolutions on electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission, which is

one of the most important mechanisms of producing solar radio bursts by FEBs.

The results show that the growth rates all decrease with the energy loss factor

Q, but increase with the magnetic mirror ratio σ as well as with the steepness

index δ. Moreover, the evolution of FEBs also can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the

fastest growing mode and the fastest growing phase angle. This leads to the

change of the polarization sense of ECM emission.

In particular, our results

also reveal that FEB that undergoes diﬀerent evolution processes will generate

diﬀerent types of ECM emission. We believe the present results to be very helpful

on more comprehensive understanding of dynamic spectra of solar radio bursts.

INTRODUCTION

Beams of energetic particles are the common products in various active phenomena

in space and cosmic plasmas. For the Sun, particle acceleration is most prominent in

ﬂares and coronal shock wave. It is generally recognized that the magnetic reconnection

process during ﬂares can convert magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energies of

the accelerated particles (Masuda et al. 1994; Yokoyama et al. 2001; Hara et al. 2011;

Imada et al. 2013). Lin & Hudson (1976) pointed out that as much as half of the liberated

energy from ﬂares can be converted into acceleration of charged particles through the

magnetic reconnection process. Collisionless shocks are also the strong sources of fast

electron beams (FEBs) (Blandford & Eichler 1987). For the coronal shock wave, there are

two diﬀerent generation mechanisms: blast waves are initiated by the plasma pressure of

ﬂare and piston-driven shock waves are due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (Nindos et al.

2011). The primary theory for explaining particles acceleration in the vicinity of shock

waves is diﬀusive shock acceleration (DSA) (Bell 1978; Drury 1983; Blandford & Eichler

1987). Electron accelerated by the quasi-perpendicular shocks has been discussed by many

authors and proposed that they can be accelerated through shock drift acceleration (Wu

1984; Park et al. 2012; Guo & Giacalone 2015). For the quasi-parallel shocks, when large

amplitude magnetic ﬂuctuation is present, the shocks can accelerate electrons eﬃciently

(Masters et al. 2013).

FEBs reveal themselves not only in hard X-ray and γ-ray, but also in the radio emission

(Pick & van den Oord 1990). The most direct observational evidence in radio emission for

FEBs is the type III bursts and decimetric blips, which have similar properties as type

III events (St¨ahli & Benz 1987). Type III bursts are due to FEBs traveling upward along

the open magnetic ﬁeld structures. Observations of radio bursts also reveal that FEBs

also propagate in the downward direction (reverse-slope drift bursts) or along the closed

– 4 –

magnetic ﬁeld lines (type J and U bursts) (Aschwanden et al. 1995). When electron beams

propagate downward along the closed loop, electrons with large pitch angles can be reﬂected

and captured in the loop, while electrons with small pitch angles will precipitate into the

denser chromosphere. It is the precipitate and trapped electrons which produce hard X-ray

and radio emission, respectively. The key issue is how a beam of fast electrons leads to the

generation of solar radio bursts described above. Ginzburg & Zhelezniakov (1958) proposed

the so-called plasma emission. In this conventional theory, Langmuir waves play a

key role. FEBs accelerated by the magnetic reconnection process or coronal

shock wave can excite Langmuir waves due to beam-plasma instability along

their path when they propagate in corona. Then these electrostatic waves are

partly converted into electromagnetic waves via nonlinear wave-wave interaction

(Robinson et al. 1993; Wu et al. 1994). Reiner et al. (1998) found that plasma

emission is the emission mechanism of type II bursts which is generated in

the upstream region of the CME-driven shock. This theory which treats the

acceleration of electrons near the shock, formation of FEBs, generation of

Langmuir waves, and conversion of Langmuir waves into electromagnetic waves

has been studied by many authors (Knock et al. 2001; Knock & Cairns 2005;

Schmidt & Gopalswany 2008). Another important coherent theory was suggested by

Twiss (1958) and Schneider (1959) which direct amplify the electromagnetic waves at

frequencies near the electron gyrofrequency and its harmonics. The electron-cyclotron maser

(ECM) instability due to the wave-particle interaction is the ampliﬁcation mechanism.

As a dominant mechanism for radio emission in astrophysics, ECM emission has

been extensively applied to various short-time radio bursts from the magnetized planets,

the Sun, and other stars (Treumann 2006). In the references about ECM emission, the

FEBs responsible for the generation of radio radiation are treated as an invariable source.

However, FEBs propagating downwards deeper into the solar atmosphere will lose some

– 5 –

of their energy via the interaction with the dense plasma (Pick & van den Oord 1990)

and the energy spectrum of FEBs will evolve due to this energy loss process. High

resolution X-ray observations suggest that the noncollisional energy loss of FEBs which are

traveling in the loop did can ﬂatten the spectrum of footpoint source (Battaglia & Benz

2008). Furthermore, the velocity distribution of FEBs and the parameters of ambient

plasma will change as they traveling in the complex magnetized plasma. In particular, the

evolutions of the energy spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs due to the energy loss

processes and the pitch-angle scatter in the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly

inﬂuence the eﬃciency and property of their emissions. Study of X-ray emission can

provide us information about the acceleration and evolution processes of FEBs. On the

other hand, X-ray emission has close association with solar radio emission (Kane 1981;

Aschwanden et al. 1985; Aschwanden & Guedel 1992), which indicates that X-ray and radio

emissions are excited by the same evolving electron beam (Kundu & Vlahos 1982; Gary

1985; Aschwanden 2002).

In this paper, we concentrate on the characteristic of ECM emission excited by the

evolutional FEBs traveling in a coronal loop associated with CME. We suggest that the

energetic electrons which excite the ECM emission are accelerated in the CME-driven shock

front. The results show that the evolution of electron beams have signiﬁcantly inﬂuence on

ECM emission. With diﬀerent energy loss process, the FEBs can produce diﬀerent radio

emissions. The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we introduce the basic physical model

in Section 2. Secondly, the ECM instability excited by the energetic electrons which travel

in the loop is discussed in Section 3. Finally, discussions and conclusions are presented in

Section 4.

2. THE PHYSICAL MODEL

2.1. Magnetic Field Conﬁguration of Source Region

Beams of energetic electron are prominently created during solar ﬂares by the magnetic

reconnection process or during CMEs by the CME-driven shock wave. CMEs are deﬁned

as the outward traveling bright arc seen in the coronagraphs and the dark cavity (Forbes

2000). It constitutes large-scale ejections of magnetic ﬂux and mass and conceives a

steady expansion as it propagating from lower corona to the interplanetary space, with

two foot points on the Sun (Chen 1997). High resolution X-ray imaging observation shows

that all the CMEs and prominence eruptions have a giant arches structure (˘Svestka et al.

1997; Forbes 2000). Here we consider the latter case and propose the magnetic ﬁeld

conﬁguration of source region as Figure1. When the outward propagating CMEs overtake

the local fast magnetosonic wave, it can drive a forward shock ahead of CME (Stewart et al.

1974). The CME-driven shock front is the acceleration site for solar energetic electrons.

The acceleration mechanism of electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks is the shock-drift

acceleration, it is simple and eﬀective (Wu et al. 1994; Park et al. 2012; Guo & Giacalone

2015).

Zhao et al. (2014) proposed a model for the generation of radio radiation from the shock

front. In their model, Alfv´en wave is ﬁrst excited by the energetic ion beam accelerated

in the shock front, then a density-depleted duct can form due to the excited Alfv´en wave

along the foreshock boundary. Energetic electrons are also accelerated by the shock waves

and part of the energetic electrons propagate in this density-depleted duct which drive the

maser emission may give rise to type II bursts (Zhao et al. 2014). In our model, we also

proposed that the FEBs which excite radio emission are accelerated by CME-driven shock

wave.

It is suggested that

energetic electrons travel in the loop excite cyclotron maser emission and produce the radio

emission.

– 8 –

When the energetic electrons leave the accelerate site, some of them propagate along

the open magnetic ﬁeld line, and the remaining energetic electrons will propagate along

and be trapped in the magnetic loop. When the electron beam precipitates from the

top to the footpoint they will lose most of their energy due to the interaction with the

ambient plasma (Xu et al. 2013). The energy loss would result in a ﬂatter spectral index

and change the lower cutoﬀ energy of the footpoint source. On the other hand, because of

the complex magnetic ﬁeld topology, velocity distribution of FEBs and the parameters of

ambient magnetic plasma also will change when they propagating from the looptop to the

footpoint. Therefore, the distribution functions of FEBs from the looptop to the footpoint

are variational. It is these evolving FEBs with diﬀerent evolution process excite cyclotron

maser instability and produce diﬀerent radio burst events.

2.2. Evolution of Fast Electron Beams

Energetic streams of electrons are created during various active phenomena. The

most direct observational evidence for energetic electrons are from X-ray, γ-ray, and radio

emission. When the energetic electrons escape from the acceleration site, some of them move

outwards into the interplanetary space and often can be detected via their characteristic

emission of corona and interplanetary type III bursts. The others propagate downwards

along the magnetic ﬁeld lines, because of the convergent magnetic ﬁeld, electrons with

small pitch angles will precipitate into the dense chromosphere and electrons with large

pitch angles will be reﬂected at the mirror points. It is this precipitate and reﬂected

electrons produce the X-ray and radio emissions. Observations frequently demonstrate that

there is a looptop X-ray source in the corona and two or more footpoint X-ray sources in

the chromosphere (Frost & Dennis 1971; Hudson 1978; Hoyng et al. 1981). Kosugi et al.

(1988) made a statistical study and show that the X-ray has a strong association with

– 9 –

the microwave emission. This indicates that they could be excited by the same energetic

electron beam in the diﬀerent levels of solar atmosphere.

Electron beams traveling in a closed loop will loose most of their energy. High resolution

observations of X-ray emissions and the evolution of X-ray spectrum could provide us

information for understanding the physics of acceleration and energy loss of the FEBs

(Zharkova et al. 1995; Hannah & Kontar 2011; Xu et al. 2013). It is believed that both the

looptop and the footpoint X-ray emissions are produced by a single FEB which travels along

the loops structure from the looptop to footpoint. The emission mechanism for the X-ray

source is the thin-target bremsstrahlung at the looptop and the thick-target bremsstrahlung

at the footpoints, respectively. According to this emission model, the accelerated

electron beam with power-law spectrum distribution F (E) ∝ E−δb in the corona

will emit X-ray emission at the looptop source with the photon spectrum

I(ǫ) ∝ ǫ−γlt, here the spectral index γlt = δb + 1, E is the energy of electron, ǫ is

the energy of photon (Arnoldy et al. 1968; Lin & Hudson 1976; Hannah & Kontar 2011).

If the power-law electrons only encounter Coulomb collisions with the ambient plasma

when they propagate to the chromosphere, the footpoint source could produce a power-law

spectrum I(ǫ) ∝ ǫ−γf p with an index of γf p = δb − 1 (Brown 1971; Hannah & Kontar

2011). This standard ﬂare model indicates the diﬀerence of the spectral indices between

the looptop and the footpoint sources is 2 (Hannah & Kontar 2011). However, observations

of solar ﬂare demonstrate that the diﬀerence of spectral index is inconsistent with the

prediction of emission models (Masuda et al. 1994, 1995). Petrosian et al. (2002) proposed

that the average diﬀerence is about ∆γ = 1.3 ± 1.5, according to the survey of Yohkoh ﬂares

observations. This discrepancy between observations and predictions suggests that there

must exist other energy loss mechanism except the Coulomb collisions. Battaglia & Benz

(2008) proposed that noncollisional energy loss via the induced electric ﬁeld can ﬂat the

footpoint spectrum and lead to the larger diﬀerence of spectral indices. This induced

– 10 –

electric ﬁeld is due to the return current generated by the energetic electron beam.

Hannah & Kontar (2011) investigate the spectral evolution of X-ray sources including

wave-particle interactions and found that the growth of Langmuir waves can ﬂatten the

spectrum of footpoint source. The looptop source is unchanged and so the diﬀerence

of spectral indices can be greater than 2. To study the evolution of energetic electron

spectrum travelling in the solar atmosphere, pitch angle scattering and various energy loss

mechanisms, such as Coulomb collisions, anomalous resistivity in the return current system,

wave-particle interactions and so on should be taken into account.

For simplicity, we assume that the energy loss of energetic electrons, δE is independent

of their initial energy E when electrons travel in the loop structure. So the energy

distribution function of energetic electrons for the initial form

Flt(E) = AE−δ

(1)

at the looptop will evolve into the ﬁnal form because of the energy loss δE (Xu et al. 2013):

Ff p(E′) = A(E′ + δE)−δ.

(2)

Here A is the normalized factor, E′ = E − δE is the energy of energetic electrons when they

arrive at the footpoint (Xu et al. 2013).

Wang (2004) proposed that energetic electrons captured at the apex of the magnetic

loop have a beam-like velocity distribution. In our model, electrons are accelerated in the

advancing shock front. Some of the energetic electrons leave the acceleration region and

precipitate along the arch structure (see Fig.1). So we also propose that the precipitated

electrons have a beam velocity distribution when they leave the acceleration site. On

the other hand, hard X-ray observations demonstrate that energetic electrons, which can

excite ECM instability, generally have an approximate power-law energy distribution with

a lower energy cutoﬀ (Lin 1974; Stupp 2000; Aschwanden 2002). The spectral index of

– 11 –

power-law electrons typically α = 3 and is in the range of 2 ∼ 6 (Stupp 2000). In principle,

it is diﬃcult to describe the special form of the lower energy cutoﬀ behavior based on

observations. Wu & Tang (2008) ﬁtted the more general power-law spectrum with the

lower energy cutoﬀ behavior described by a hyperbolic tangent function. Consequently, we

propose the following electron distribution function when they leave the acceleration site:

F0(u, µ) = A0tanh(cid:18) u

site as below:

3.1. ECM Emission Theory

ECM emission is a well-known radiation mechanism and has been extensively applied

to various solar radio bursts (Treumann 2006). Based on the cold-plasma theory, we have

3.2. The Growth Rate of ECM Instability

With the velocity distribution function F1(µ, u1) given by equation(5), the growth rates

of ECM emission in the O and X modes can be calculated based on equation(7). For given

parameters (δ, α, uc, β, and Q) of FEBs and background magneto-plasma parameters (Ω

and σ) in the source region, the growth rates of ECM instability depends on parameters ω

and θ. Here Ω is the frequency ratio of ωce to ωp. Both the peak and the maximum growth

rates are normalized by ωcenb/n0. Figure 2 presents the peak growth rates with varying ω

and ﬁxed phase angle θ. Figure 3 shows the maximum growth rates with varying ω and θ

together, versus frequency ratio Ω. Panels O1 and X2 denote the fundamental wave of O

mode and harmonic wave of X mode, respectively. The solid line, dotted line, and dot dash

line denote the growth rates of ECM instability excited at looptop (LT), loopmid (LM),

and footpoint (FP) sources, respectively. Here the spectrum index α = 3, deepness index

δ = 6, uc = 0.3c, β = 0.25c, and for Figure 2, frequency ratio Ω = 2 has been used. When

the FEBs travel in the loop from the top to the footpoint, parameters σ = 0, Q = 0.1;

σ = 0, Q = 0.51(O1) and Q = 0.7(X2); and σ = 3.5, Q = 1.5 have been used for the LT,

LM, and FP sources, respectively. Both in Figure 2 and 3, the growth rates of LM source

have been enlarged by a factor of 100. This implies that the growth rates at LT and FP

sources are at least two orders of magnitude greater than that of LM source.

It is found that the energy loss process of FEBs can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the eﬃciency

and property of ECM emission. The growth rates of O1 and X2 modes all decrease rapidly

with the energy loss factor Q. Figure 2 shows that the phase angles θ of the maximum

growth rates of LM source can deviate from that of LT and FP sources obviously due

to the energy loss of fast electrons. The velocity distribution of FEBs will evolve due to

the magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneity and also inﬂuence the eﬃciency and property of their

emission. Our calculation show that the growth rates of FP sources can increase to a

comparable value to the LT sources because of the convergent magnetic ﬁeld at footpoint.

Figure 2 and 3 show that the O1 mode has larger growth rates than X2 mode and becomes

the dominant mode at FP sources due to the loss-cone anisotropy (σ = 3.5). Figure 2 and 3

imply that if the FEBs have a moderate steepness cutoﬀ behavior (δ = 6, α = 3) when they

leave the acceleration region and the loop have magnetic mirror eﬀect only in the footpoint

region, the growth rates at LM sources are very small. One can anticipate that the growth

rates of LM sources will three or four orders of magnitude smaller than that of LT and FP

sources if the FEBs loss more energy (i.e., Q > 0.51 or 0.7) when they travel from top to

middle part of the loop. So for the case of Figure 2 and 3, ECM emission from the evolving

FEBs which travel in the loop will form three separate radio sources.

Figure 4 and 5 present the peak and maximum growth rates as a function of phase

angle θ and frequency ratio Ω, respectively. The acronym LT, LM, and FP also denote the

looptop source, loopmid source, and footpoint source, respectively. The spectrum index

α = 3, deepness index δ = 10, uc = 0.3c, β = 0.25c, and Ω = 2 in Figure 4 have been used.

Here, the magnetic mirror ratio σ and energy loss factor Q have the same values as Figure

2 and 3 for the LT, LM and FP sources. It also shows that the O1 mode will has larger

growth rates than X2 mode and becomes the dominant mode at FP sources. Compare

Figure 2 with 4 one can ﬁnd that the growth rates all increase with the steepness index δ,

especially for the LM sources. Figure 4 and 5 imply that if the energetic electrons have a

steeper cutoﬀ behavior (i.e., have a larger steepness index) when they leave the acceleration

region, the growth rates of LM source are comparable to that of LT or FP sources, even

larger than the growth rates of FP source (see Figure 5). So for this case, ECM emission

excited by the evolving FEBs which propagate from the looptop to the footpoint will form

– 16 –

a continuous radio source.

In Figure 6, we also plotted dependence of maximum growth rates on the frequency

ratio Ω, where the parameters α = 3, δ = 6, uc = 0.3c, and β = 0.25c have been

used. The solid line, dotted line, and dot dash line also correspond to emission at LT,

LM, and FP sources, respectively. Here, we choose the parameters σ = 0, Q = 0.1;

σ = 1.5, Q = 0.51(O1), Q = 0.7(X2); and σ = 3.5, Q = 1.5 for the LT, LM, and FP sources,

respectively. It shows that the growth rates of LM sources can be greater than that of

LT or FP source if the magnetic ﬁeld converge from the middle part of the loop and the

dominant mode also shift from X2 mode to O1 mode at the LM and FP sources. Figure 6

implies that if the CME loop has a eﬀective magnetic mirror eﬀect from middle part, ECM

emission from the evolving FEBs which travel and trapped in such magnetic loop will form

a continuous radio burst.

4. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Particle acceleration is one of the most signiﬁcant process which is ubiquitous in

space and cosmic plasmas. For the Sun, it is generally acknowledged that FEBs usually

are produced by the magnetic reconnection process during ﬂares or by the diﬀusive shock

acceleration in the vicinity of corona shock wave. FEBs can be detected directly by X-ray,

γ−ray, and radio observations and we can diagnose the FEBs as well as the solar plasma

environment from solar radio bursts. When the FEBs traveling in the loop will loss some

of their energy due to various energy loss mechanism and get a more ﬂat spectrum. The

velocity distribution of FEBs and the magnetic plasma parameters will change as they

traveling in the solar plasma. So it is signiﬁcative to study the radio emission from evolving

FEBs which are traveling in solar atmosphere.

In this paper, we discuss the possible evolution of the energy spectrum and the

velocity distribution of FEBs and analyze the eﬀects of these evolution on ECM emission.

Results from our calculations show that the evolution of the energy spectrum and velocity

distribution of FEBs can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the eﬃciency and property of ECM

emissions. It is clear that the growth rates all decrease rapidly with the energy loss factor

Q but increase with the steepness index δ and magnetic mirror ratio σ, respectively. The

growth rates of O1 mode can be larger than that of X2 mode and becomes the dominant

mode at FP and LM sources due to the energy loss and the evolution of velocity distribution

of FEBs. The results also show that the phase angles θ of the maximum growth rates of

LM source can deviate from that of LT and FP sources obviously when the fast electrons

lose most of their energy and the magnetic ﬁeld don’t converge at the LM source. If the

FEBs have a moderate steepness cutoﬀ behavior (δ = 6, α = 3) and the loop have magnetic

mirror eﬀect only in the footpoint region, the growth rates at LM sources are very small

and the emission from such evolving FEBs will form three separate radio sources. If the

FEBs have a steeper cutoﬀ behavior (i.e., have a larger steepness index) or the loop has

a eﬀective magnetic mirror eﬀect from middle region, the growth rates of LM sources are

comparable to that of LT and FP sources and the emission excited by such evolving FEBs

will form a continuous radio source.

The moving type IV (IVM) burst is a relatively rare form and it occurs after a solar

ﬂare or a coronal mass ejection. Sine the identiﬁcation of IVM bursts, plenty of work

have been done to explain the emission process of this rare bursts. It is widely believed

that IVM bursts have a strong association with radio type II bursts (Boischot & Denisse

1957; Smerd & Dulk 1971). Kai (1969) proposed a common shock wave as the source

for generation of IVM and type II bursts. However, the radiation mechanism of the two

types of bursts remains as a open problem. Based on our proposed model, cyclotron maser

mechanism can be the possible emission process of IVM bursts. Energetic electron beams

accelerated in the CME-driven shock front and excite ECM emission along the expanding

CME associated loop. If the accelerated electrons have a moderate steepness cutoﬀ behavior

and the expanding loop have magnetic mirror eﬀect only in the footpoint, ECM emission

can form three separate radio sources, i.e., the expand arch IVM bursts. If the energetic

electron beams have a steeper cutoﬀ behavior when they leave the acceleration site or

the CME loop has a eﬀective magnetic mirror eﬀect from the middle part, these trapped

electrons will excite ECM emission and form a continuous radio source, i.e., the advancing

front IVM bursts.
