Abstract In this paper, we propose and analyze a new fractional order malaria
model with temporary immunity. We extend the existing malaria model to in-
clude fractional derivatives. Basic reproduction number is computed using the
next generation matrix method. Model equilibria are determined and their local
asymptotic stability analysis are considered. An eﬃcient Adams-type predictor-
corrector method is used to solve the initial value problem. Finally, phase plane
portrait are generated to describe the dynamics between susceptible fractions of
human hosts and infected fractions of mosquito vectors.

1 Introduction

Malaria is one of the deadly vector-borne diseases aﬀecting the developing part of
the world and mostly in Africa. The reports by the World Health Organization
(see, e.g, WHO, 2005, 2012, 2014) indicates that, malaria is a serious threat to
human life and remains a dangerous infectious disease. Its economic burden on the
aﬀected countries are extremely huge and needs serious public health attention.
Since its discovery, many researchers have studied the disease dynamics math-
ematically to capture and understand the complex interaction between infected
mosquitoes and the susceptible human population.

Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases has played a key role in understand-
ing the dynamical processes of disease transmission and control strategies. The ﬁrst

malaria epidemiological model was constructed and formulated by Ross (1911). He
used deterministic compartmental models to describe malaria infection dynam-
ics between human and mosquito populations. Ngwa and Shu (2000) proposed a
malaria model and considered global stability analysis for the disease free equi-
librium point. Mandal et al. (2011) considered an extensive survey and review
on modeling of malaria infection. Backward bifurcation analysis is very impor-
tant in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and has been investigated
by many authors in malaria infection models (see, e.g, Keegan and Dushoﬀ, 2013;
Ghosh et al., 2013; Chiyaka et al., 2008; Chitnis, 2005; Chitnis et al., 2006; Ngong-
hala et al., 2012). ´Aguas et al. (2012) developed an age structure model to study
the eﬀects of relapse in malaria parasites. A periodic model based on the Ross-
MacDonald model was considered by Gao et al. (2014). They studied the eﬀects of
spatial heterogeneity and temporal on disease dynamics. Their proposed model in-
corporated periodic behavior in mosquito ecology and seasonal human movement
to capture variations of malaria spread among diﬀerent regions.

Tumwiine et al. (2010) proposed and analyzed a malaria infection model with in-
fective immigrants. Tumwiine et al. (2007b) formulated an epidemic model with
standard incidence for the dynamics of malaria infection. They applied additive
compound matrices approach to show global stability analysis of the endemic equi-
librium. Using the model in Tumwiine et al. (2007b), the same authors (Tumwiine
et al., 2007a) studied the oscillatory behavior of malaria disease in a population
with temporary immunity. Their numerical results shows that the endemic equi-
librium converges to a steady state. Okosun and Makinde (2011) developed a
deterministic compartmental model to investigate the impact of drug resistance in
malaria infection and the same authors (Okosun and Makinde, 2014) formulated
an optimal control model for malaria and cholera co-infection.

Abdullahi et al. (2013) have assessed the eﬀectiveness of drugs in a malaria trans-
mission model. Barley et al. (2012), Mukandavire et al. (2009) and Abu-Raddad
et al. (2006) formulated a model to study infectious disease co-infection of HIV and
malaria. Okosun and Makinde (2013) studied the spread of malaria infection with
an optimal control model. Pongtavornpinyo et al. (2008), they studied the spread
of anti-malaria resistance. Lawi et al. (2011) studied co-infection model for malaria
and meningitis among children. They observed that, when the threshold parameter
R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium might exhibit some instabilities in the global
sense. They further applied centre manifold theorem to investigate asymptotic sta-
bility of the endemic equilibrium. Antia et al. (2008) studied the dynamics of acute
malaria transmission using an age-structured models. A mathematical model for
malaria infection which incorporates weather has been formulated and studied by
Hoshen and Morse (2004). Koella and Anita (2003) developed an epidemic model
to explore the incidence of anti-malarial resistance.

Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases dynamics and other important ar-
eas of studies such as economics, ﬁnance and engineering has extensively been
explored using the theory and applications of the classical diﬀerential equations.
But in recent times, the theory and applications of fractional calculus has become
extremely useful and important in modeling of biological processes and other ar-
eas of studies due to the memory property of fractional derivatives. Many authors

have contributed signiﬁcantly in compartmental modeling of infectious disease dy-
namics using fractional diﬀerential equations. Sardar et al. (2015) have developed
a mosquito-transmitted disease model with fractional diﬀerential equations. Pinto
and Machado (2013) described fractional order models for malaria infection. They
modiﬁed the integer order compartmental model formulated by Chiyaka et al.
(2008) to numerically study control strategies in malaria dynamics. Fractional or-
der models for HIV and TB co-infection have been analysed by Pinto and Carvalho
(2014). Fractional order models for HIV infection have been considered and anal-
ysed by several authors (see, e.g, Ye and Ding, 2009; Gokdogan et al., 2011; Liu
et al., 2014; Arafa et al., 2014; Ding and Ye, 2009; Ding et al., 2012; Liu and Lu,
2014). Liu and Chen (2015) constructed fractional order competition model for
love triangle. Ahmad and El-Khazali (2007) proposed a mathematical model for
love using fractional order systems. El-Saka (2015) investigated backward bifurca-
tion in a fractional order vaccination model.

Javidi and Ahmad (2014) developed fractional order model for cholera infection.
Arafa et al. (2012) applied homotopy analysis method and fourth order Runge-
Kutta method to generate analytical and numerical results for fractional order
childhood disease models. An epidemic model with fractional order for inﬂuenza
A have been formulated and analysed (see, e.g, El-Shahed and Alsaedi, 2011;
Gonz´alez-Parra et al., 2014). Rihan et al. (2014) studied deterministic fractional
order SIRC model with Salmonella bacteria infection. Ahmed and El-Saka (2010)
presented and discussed fractional order systems for Hepatitis C virus. The deadly
ebola disease which killed a lot of people in some part of Africa has been modelled
by a system of fractional order derivatives (Area et al., 2015). An endemic model
with constant population has been analytically and numerically studied by Okyere
et al. (2016) using Caputo fractional derivatives.

In this work, we formulate a fractional order model for malaria infection with tem-
porary immunity. We consider the malaria disease model studied and analysed by
Tumwiine et al. (2007a,b). The authors developed their model using determinis-
tic integer order diﬀerential equations. Our new model will be constructed using
fractional order derivatives. We are motivated by this method of mathematical
formulation in epidemiological modeling due to the eﬀective nature of fractional
derivatives.

The rest of the article is as follows. In section 2, we formulate the fractional order
malaria model. Section 3, deals with non-negativity of model solutions. In section
4, we compute model equilibria and the basic reproduction number and then in-
vestigate local asymptotic stability analysis. We consider numerical simulations in
section 5. In section 6, we discuss simulation results and ﬁnally conclude the paper
in section 7.

2 Model Derivation

In this section, we extend and modify the integer order malaria model by Tumwi-
ine et al. (2007a,b) to become fractional order malaria model. The theory and
applications of fractional calculus has become extremely useful and important in

modeling of biological processes and other areas of studies due to the memory
property of fractional derivatives. Many authors have contributed signiﬁcantly in
compartmental modeling of infectious disease dynamics using fractional diﬀeren-
tial equations. There are several deﬁnitions of fractional derivatives and integrals
in fractional calculus (see, e.g, Petras, 2011; Podlubny, 1999), but in this work,
our model construction will be based on Caputo derivative. Our motivation for
this type of fractional derivative is based on the fact that, it has an advantage on
initial value problems.

Deﬁnition 1 (Podlubny, 1999; Petras, 2011) Fractional integral of order α is
deﬁned as

I αg(t) =

In this article, we consider the scaled malaria model model presented by
Tumwiine et al. (2007a,b). The authors, transformed their compartmental malaria
model (SH IH RH − SV IV ) into systems of proportions (shihrh − sviv) for the hu-
man and mosquito populations describe by systems of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions.

The new model we consider in this paper is the system of non-linear fractional
diﬀerential equations in the sense of Caputo fractional derivatives.

with sh(t) + ih(t) + rh(t) = 1 and sv(t) + iv(t) = 1.
It is important to remark that when the fractional order α → 1, the fractional
order malaria model (2) with the model restrictions sh(t) + ih(t) + rh(t) = 1 and
sv(t)+iv(t) = 1, becomes the integer order malaria model (1) studied by Tumwiine
et al. (2007a,b).

3 Non-negative Solutions

+ = {X ∈ R5 : X ≥ 0}, where X = (sh, ih, rh, sv, iv)T . We apply the
Let R5
following Lemma in (Odibat and Shawagfeh, 2007) to show the theorem about the
non-negative solutions of the model.

Lemma 1 (Odibat and Shawagfeh, 2007) (Generalized Mean Value Theorem).
Suppose that w(x) ∈ C[a, b] and Dαw(x) ∈ C(a, b] for 0 < α ≤ 1, then we have

w(x) = w(a) +

Γ (α)

Dαw(ξ)(x − a)α

with a ≤ ξ ≤ x, ∀x ∈ (a, b].

6

E. Okyere, F. T. Oduro, S. K. Amponsah, I. K. Dontwi, N. K. Frempong

Remark 1 Assume that w(x) ∈ C[a, b] and Dαw(x) ∈ C(a, b], for 0 < α ≤ 1. It
follows from Lemma 1 that if Dαw(x) ≥ 0,∀x ∈ (a, b) then w(x) is non-decreasing
∀x ∈ [a, b] and if Dαw(x) ≤ 0,∀x ∈ (a, b), then w(x) is non-increasing ∀x ∈ [a, b].

Theorem 1 The malaria disease model (2) has a unique solution and it remains
in R5
+.

Proof By applying Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.2 in (Lin, 2007), the existence and
uniqueness of the solution of equation (2) in (0,∞) follows. The domain R5
+ for
the model problem is positively invariant, since

h + ναih + γαrh ≥ 0,

Dαsh|sh=0 = λα
Dαih|ih=0 = aαbmshiv ≥ 0,
Dαrh|rh=0 = rαih ≥ 0,
Dαsv|sv =0 = λα
v ≥ 0,
Dαiv|iv =0 = aαcsvih ≥ 0,

(3)

on each hyperplane bounding the non-negative orthant, the vector ﬁled points into
R5
+.

By solving equation (4) and ignoring the steps involved, the disease-free equilib-
rium is given by Fo = (1, 0, 0, 1, 0) and the endemic equilibrium as

Next, we compute the basic reproduction number Ro using the next generation
method on the fractional order malaria model (2). By using the method and the
notations by Driessche and Watmough (2002), the special matrices F ( for new
infections terms) and V (for the remaining transitions terms) related to the model
problem (2) are respectfully given by

The disease-free equilibrium point Fo is locally asymptotically if all the eigenvalues

From the square matrix J(Fo), it is obvious that, three of the eigenvalues are given

The rest of the eigenvalues can determined from the sub-matrix given as:

The trace of matrix B is given by

The determinant of B yields :

Therefore detB > 0 if R0 < 1.

Since detB > 0 if R0 < 1 and tr(B) < 0, it follows that the two remaining
eigenvalues will have negative real parts and we can therefore conclude that, the
disease equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, otherwise unstable.

4.2 Local Asymptotic Stability Analysis of Endemic Equilibrium

In this subsection, we discuss the local stability of the endemic equilibrium point.
Our analysis is based on the construction by Ahmed et al. (2006, 2007). From the

Fractional Order Malaria Model With Temporary Immunity

model constraints sv + iv = 1 and sh + ih + rh = 1, we can reduce the dimension
of the malaria model in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the analysis.
As in Tumwiine et al. (2007a,b), let sv = 1 − iv and rh = 1 − sh − ih then the
5-dimensional fractional order model (2) reduces to a 3-dimensional problem with
Jacobian matrix evaluated the at endemic equilibrium F∗ as:

(i) If the discriminant of g(x), D(g) is positive and Routh-Hurwitz conditions are
satisﬁed , i.e. D(g) > 0, b1 > 0, b3 > 0, then the endemic equilibrium F∗ locally
asymptotically stable.
(ii) If D(g) < 0, b1 ≥ 0, b2 ≥ 0, b3 > 0, α < 2/3, then the endemic equilibrium
F∗ locally asymptotically stable.
(iii)If D(g) < 0, b1 > 0, b2 > 0, b1b2 = b3, α ∈ (0, 1), then the endemic
equilibrium F∗ locally asymptotically stable.

If D(g) < 0, b1 < 0, b2 < 0, α > 2/3, then the endemic equilibrium F∗ is unstable.

5 Numerical Simulations

Analytical solutions of nonlinear coupled fractional order diﬀerential equations
are as diﬃcult as the classical integer order system of nonlinear equations. There-
fore, there is need to consider numerical discretizations and approximations for
such systems or models. Over the past years, several numerical schemes have been
developed to solve fractional order models. One of the powerful approximation
methods that has been considered by many authors (see, e.g, El-Sayed et al.,
2007; Ozalp and Demirci, 2011; Al-Sulami et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2015; Okyere
et al., 2016) is the eﬃcient Adams-type predictor-corrector method developed by
Diethelm et al. (2002, 2004). Li and Tao (2009) have considered a rigorous error
analysis of this numerical scheme.

For our numerical approximations, we re-deﬁne the variables in the model prob-
lem (2) as:

Let sh = X, ih = Y, rh = Z, sv = S, iv = I.

Therefore following the approach in (Diethelm et al., 2002, 2004; Cho et al., 2015;
Al-Sulami et al., 2014) and ignoring the details in the derivation of the scheme,
we obtain the discretized system corresponding to the fractional order malaria
model (2)as follows:

6 Results and Discussion

In this section, we discuss the endemic trajectories of our numerical solutions
with model parameter values adapted from the work by Tumwiine et al. (2007a)
and basic reproduction number Ro = 1.5. The simulated solutions for the scaled
human population sh(t), ih(t) and rh(t) are shown in Figure 1 and that of the
scaled mosquito populations sv(t), iv(t) are shown in Figure 2. In Figures 3 and 4,
we considered four diﬀerent values of the fractional α, α = 1, 0.99, 0.95 0.90. The
oscillatory behavior of the fractional order malaria model (2) are interesting and
can be compared to the research work be Tumwiine et al. (2007a). It is important
to observe that when α = 1, the model problem (2) is equivalent to the classical
initial value problem (2) and that as the fractional order α increases the behaviour
of the fractional order model solutions approaches that of the integer order model.
Phase plane portrait is displayed in Figure 5 to describe the dynamics between
susceptible fractions of human hosts and infected fractions of mosquito vectors.

7 Conclusion

In this research, we have proposed and studied fractional order model for the
integer order model developed and studied by Tumwiine et al. (2007a,b). We de-
termined the basic reproduction number Ro using the method and the notations
by Driessche and Watmough (2002). We have investigated local asymptotic sta-
bility analysis of the model equilibria. Furthermore, we have numerically describe
the trajectories of the model using Adams-type predictor-corrector method. We
have extended the existing malaria model propose by Tumwiine et al. (2007a,b) to
include fractional derivatives which is very interesting and important in the ﬁeld
of mathematical biology.
