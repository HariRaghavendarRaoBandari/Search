A STOCHASTIC SOLUTION WITH GAUSSIAN

STATIONARY INCREMENTS OF THE SYMMETRIC
SPACE-TIME FRACTIONAL DIFFUSION EQUATION∗

Gianni Pagnini 1,2, Paolo Paradisi 1,3

Abstract

The stochastic solution with Gaussian stationary increments is establihsed
for the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation when 0 < β <
α ≤ 2, where 0 < β ≤ 1 and 0 < α ≤ 2 are the fractional derivation orders
in time and space, respectively. This solution is provided by imposing the
identity between two probability density functions resulting (i) from a new
integral representation formula of the fundamental solution of the symmet-
ric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation and (ii) from the product of two
independent random variables. This is an alternative method with respect
to previous approaches such as the scaling limit of the continuos time ran-
dom walk, the parametric subordination and the subordinated Langevin
equation. A new integral representation formula for the fundamental so-
lution of the space-time fractional diﬀusion equation is ﬁrstly derived. It
is then shown that, in the symmetric case, a stochastic solution can be
obtained by a Gaussian process with stationary increments and with a ran-
dom wideness scale variable distributed according to an arrangement of two
extremal L´evy stable densities. This stochastic solution is self-similar with
stationary increments and uniquely deﬁned in a statistical sense by the
mean and the covariance structure. Numerical simulations are carried out
by choosing as Gaussian process the fractional Brownian motion. Sample
paths and probability densities functions are shown to be in agreement with
the fundamental solution of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion
equation.

1. Introduction

Space-time fractional diﬀusion was originally introduced in physics by
Zaslavsky [108, 110, 109] to study chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics in low
dimensional systems with the speciﬁc aim to model the so-called anoma-
lous diﬀusion (see also [113, 111, 112]). The label anomalous diﬀusion is
assigned to processes whose variance does not grow linearly in time [98], in
contrast to Gaussian normal diﬀusion that is mainly characterized by such
linear law. Anomalous diﬀusion has been experimentally observed several
times and deﬁnitively established in nature not only in chaotic dynamical
systems (see, e.g., References [67, 93, 27, 28, 17]).

Zaslavsky argued that, since chaotic dynamics is a physical phenomenon
whose evolution bridges between a completely regular integrable system and
a completely random process [111], kinetic equations and statistical tools
arise as modelling methods. In these cases the classical diﬀusion paradigm,
which is based on a local and linear ﬂux-gradient relationship, does not
hold, thus a non-local and/or non-linear relationship is needed.
In the
Fractional Calculus approach the idea is to maintain a linear relationship,
while introducing a non-local dependence in the ﬂux-gradient relationship
by means of integrals with inverse power-law kernels [89, 90]. This is in
agreement with the observation of non-local behavior in many natural phe-
nomena, such as the emergence of spatially extended coherent structures
in the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer [89, 85, 86, 87].

Fractional Calculus [92, 7] is nowadays recognized to be a useful math-
ematical tool for modelling such linear non-local eﬀects.
In this frame-
work, non-locality can be considered in time (time-fractional diﬀusion)
[56, 18, 99, 44, 106] or in space (space-fractional diﬀusion) [18, 33, 48, 38],
as well as both in space and time (space-time fractional diﬀusion) [112, 33,
95, 96, 57, 42, 43, 8, 50, 68, 64, 22, 24, 23, 6, 29].

Moreover, when there is no separation of time scales between the mi-
croscopic and the macroscopic level of the process, the randomness of the
microscopic level is, at least partially, transmitted to the macroscopic level
and the macroscopic dynamics is correctly described by means of non-local
operators with self-similar features, hence the emergence of Fractional Cal-
culus [46]. Further, fractional integro-diﬀerential equations are related to
the fractal properties of phenomena [94]. However, the fractional kinet-
ics strongly diﬀers from the usual kinetics because some moments of the
probability density function (PDF) of particle displacement can be inﬁnite
and the ﬂuctuations from the equilibrium state have a broad distribution
of relaxation times [101, 111, 51].

The space-time fractional diﬀusion equation reads [57]

u(±∞; t) = 0 .

u(x; 0) = u0(x) ,

(1.1a)

(1.1b)
where tDβ
∗ is the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order β and xDα
θ
is the Riesz-Feller space-fractional derivative of order α and asymmetry
parameter θ. The real parameters α, θ and β are restricted as follows
1 < β ≤ α ≤ 2 . (1.2)
0 < α ≤ 2 ,
The deﬁnitions of the fractional diﬀerential operators tDβ

The general solution of (1.1a) can be represented as

K θ

(1.3)

where K θ
α,β(x; t) is the fundamental solution, or Green function, which is
obtained by setting in (1.1b) the initial condition u0(x) = δ(x). Particular
cases of Eq. (1.1a) are the space-fractional diﬀusion equation when β =
1, the time-fractional diﬀusion equation when α = 2 and the (Gaussian)
parabolic diﬀusion equation when α = 2 and β = 1. Furthermore when
α = β = 2 the D’Alembert wave equation is recovered.

Space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a) was analytically consid-
ered by many authors [95, 103, 37, 79, 67, 57]. The fundamental solution has
been expressed by the Mellin–Barnes integral representation (A.8) [79, 57]
as well as in terms of H-Fox function [79, 63].

Solutions of equation (1.1a) have been recognized to be good ﬁtting
in anomalous diﬀusion processes such as, for example, non-diﬀusive chaotic
transport by Rossby waves in zonal ﬂow [23], transport in pressure-gradient-
driven plasma turbulence [23, 24, 22], transport with perturbative eﬀects
in magnetically conﬁned fusion plasmas [25], non-diﬀusive tracer transport
in a zonal ﬂow under the eﬀects of ﬁnite Larmor radius [47] or transport in
point vortex ﬂow [53].

On the physical ground, the time-fractional derivative is related to the
non-Markovianity, thus long-range memory, and the space-fractional de-
rivative to non-Gaussian particle displacement PDF with heavy tails, thus
non-locality. In particular, in the Rossby waves problem, the trapping ef-
fect of the vortices gives rise to non-Markovian eﬀects, determining the
emergence of subdiﬀusive behavior, and the zonal shear ﬂows give rise to
non-Gaussian particle displacement [23]. In the plasma physics problem,
the non-Markovian eﬀects are due to the trapping in electrostatic eddies

4

and the non-Gaussian particle displacements result from avalanche-like ra-
dial relaxation events [22, 24, 23]. In the context of ﬂows in porous media,
fractional time derivatives describes particles that remain motionless for
extended periods of time while fractional space derivatives model large mo-
tions through highly conductive layers or fractures [64, 9].

Castiglione et al. [15] have highlighted that fractional diﬀusion equation
(1.1a) fails to model strong anomalous diﬀusion, namely those diﬀusive
processes with the scaling laws of statistical moments depending on the
order of the moment under consideration: hX mi(t) ∼ tmg(m), where g(m)
is a function of the moment order m. This is typically associated with multi-
scaling or multi-fractal signals. However, in many systems the fractional
diﬀusion approximation was shown to be still valid, and this is even more
true when considering the long-time behavior [98, 8].

Since (1.1a) can be understood as a Master equation and its solution
as a PDF, the formulation of the underlying stochastic process is impor-
tant to physically depict the anomalous diﬀusion at the micro/mesoscopic
scale.
In this respect, it is well-known that the classical Gaussian diﬀu-
sion, namely the Brownian motion (Bm), is stochastically described by
the Wiener process. In this paper a stochastic solution for the symmetric
space-time fractional diﬀusion equation is derived, where stochastic solution
means a stochastic process whose one-point one-time PDF is the solution
of the Master (diﬀusion) equation. The symmetric space-time fractional
diﬀusion equation occurs when θ = 0:

∗ u(x; t) = xDα

0 u(x; t) =

∂|x|α , −∞ < x < +∞ ,

(1.4)

with α and β ranging as in (1.2). Preliminary analytic solutions of the sym-
metric case (1.4) were computed by Saichev & Zaslavsky [95] and Gorenﬂo,
Iskenderov & Luchko [37].

It is worth noting that the solution of (1.4) with the proper initial and
boundary conditions is unique, but this uniqueness is not met in general
in the underlying stochastic process. In fact, the Master equation deter-
mines only the one-point one-time PDF, thus there is an inﬁnite number of
stochastic solutions which deﬁne n-points n-times PDFs, each one charac-
terized by diﬀerent space-time correlation properties, that share the same
one-point one-time PDF.

In this respect it is reminded that a stochastic solution of the Mas-
ter equation (1.4) is, for example, the Continuous Time Random Walk
(CTRW) [69, 70, 105]. The CTRW is a random walk model with crucial
events occurring randomly in time, thus characterized not only by the prob-
ability distribution of the jumps, but also by the probability distribution of

STOCHASTIC SOLUTION WITH GAUSSIAN . . .

the inter-event times. In general, the events can be correlated and so the
inter-event times. However, the most frequent and reasonable assumption
is that of statistical independence among inter-event times, thus deﬁning
a renewal point process [19].
Interestingly, the renewal property, which
has been veriﬁed in many real phenomena [85, 87, 11, 84, 3], is associ-
ated with the emergence of metastable self-organized states, or coherent
structures, and, in more detail, with an intermittent birth-death process of
self-organization [87, 86, 88, 2, 1, 91, 83]. Thus, even if a rigorous derivation
of fractional operators from intermittent self-organization does not exist,
fractional diﬀusion equations are expected to emerge in these cases.

The CTRW is an exact stochastic solution when the cumulative distri-
bution of the inter-event times is a Mittag–Leﬄer function [97, 34, 36]. In
general, CTRWs with proper scaling limits in the inter-event time and/or
jump distribution satisfy the space and/or time fractional diﬀusion equa-
tion, but only in the long-time limit [39, 40, 35]. Other stochastic solutions
were derived by means of the parametric subordination [39, 40, 41] and of
the subordinated Langevin equation [33, 106, 55]. However, all these meth-
ods, which are also interconnected, do not have stationary increments.

Moreover, we highlight here also that in certain cases the knowledge of
the one-point one-time PDF is not enough to uniquely infer information on
the system, as for example the information on the ﬁrst passage time when
geometric constraints are applied [102, 66, 100].

In this paper we propose an approach that leads to a unique stochas-
tic solution in the sense that it is fully statistically characterised and has
Gaussian stationary increments. This stochastic process is essentially as-
sociated with a Gaussian stochastic process and then fully characterized
by its ﬁrst and second moments. In particular we deﬁne and characterise
a process whose one-point one-time PDF is the solution of the symmetric
space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.4).

Such process is deﬁned as the product of a Gaussian process by an inde-
pendent and constant non-negative random variable distributed according
to a combination of L´evy stable densities. The chosen Gaussian process may
have an arbitrary temporal correlation, that however must be in agreement
with the time dependent variance of the resulting ﬁnal process.

The choice of this Gaussian process can be made to meet some physical
costraints, as for example the geometrical constraints mentioned above [102,
66, 100], and after this some conditions for the statistical characterisation
can be derived.

Here, the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is chosen, among the in-
ﬁnite diﬀerent Gaussian processes that can be used, because this choice

6

G. Pagnini, P. Paradisi

provides a self-similar process with Gaussian stationary increments, beside
the fact that it is a simple approach for trajectory simulations.

To achieve this stochastic solution with stationary increments we ﬁrstly
derive a new integral representation formula for the fundamental solution
of the asymmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a). Then, we
consider the symmetric case corresponding to Eq. (1.4) and we exploit the
identity between the PDFs resulting, on one side, from such new integral
representation formula and, on the other side, from the product of two
independent random variables. Finally we establish the correspondence of
such product of two independent random variables with the product of a
Gaussian process, e.g., the fBm, by an appropriate random variable.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive
a new integral representation formula for the fundamental solution of the
space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a). In Section 3 we obtain the
stochastic solution of (1.4) by using the identity between the resulting PDF
of the integral representation formula and the PDF of the product of two
independent variables. In Section 4 we show the results of numerical sim-
ulations and, ﬁnally, we draw some discussions and conclusions in Section
5. In Appendix we summarize the main properties of space-time fractional
diﬀusion equation (1.1a).

2. Integral representation formulae for the fundamental solution

of the space-time fractional diﬀusion equation

2.1. Brief review on integral representation formulae. Let Y (τ ),
τ > 0, be a stochastic process. If the parameter τ is randomized according
to a second stochastic process T with non-negative increments, i.e., τ =
T (t), then the resulting process X(t) = Y (T (t)) is said to be subordinated
to Y (τ ), which is called the parent process, and to be directed by T (t),
which is the directing process [32]. In diﬀusive processes, the parameter τ
is a time-like variable and it is referred to as the operational time [30]. In
terms of PDFs, such subordination process is embodied by the following
integral formula

where p(x; t) is the PDF of the resulting process X(t), ψ(x; τ ) is the PDF
of the parent process Y (τ ) and ϕ(τ ; t) the PDF of the directing process
T (t).

Formula (2.1) is a particular case of integral representation formula
that can be studied in the framework of the Mellin transform theory and
interpreted as a convolution integral [61, 62]. Many integral representation

formulae, which are summarized in the following, were studied indepen-
dently from their stochastic interpretation, which is not given only by the
subordination approach.

The PDFs under consideration display a self-similar or scaling prop-
erty, i.e., they can be reduced to functions of a similarity variable namely
F (x; t) = 1/tΛF0(x/tΛ), where Λ is the scaling parameter. In order to sim-
plify the mathematical notation, and without loss of generality, hereinafter
the same symbol is used for both the two-variable function F (x; t) and the
one-variable function F0(z), z = x/tΛ, so that the above relationship turns
out to be written as F (x; t) = 1/tΛF (x/tΛ). The chosen notation is not
ambiguous as the meaning clearly follows from the number of independent
variables.

The following valuable integral representation formula for K θ

α,β(x; t)

where Lθ
α(x; t) is the L´evy stable distribution with scaling parameter α
and asymmetry parameter θ. In particular, the L´evy stable distribution is
the fundamental solution of the space-fractional diﬀusion equation that is
α(x; t) = K θ
obtained as special case of (1.1a) when β = 1, i.e., Lθ

(see Appendix). By putting t/y = ξ1/β, formula (2.2) becomes [57]

This formula is also used in the elegant parametric subordination ap-
proach, developed by Gorenﬂo and co-authors [45, 39, 40, 41], and it is
based on a systematic and consequent application of the CTRW integral
equation to the various processes involved. This approach considers the
parent process Y (τ ) and the random walk t = T −1(τ ), which is the inverse
of τ = T (t) and it is called the leading process. Hence, after the identiﬁ-
cation of the particle trajectory with the parent process, from the system
composed by X = Y (τ ) and t = t(τ ) the dummy variable τ can be elim-
inated and the evolution of X(t) obtained. This is similar to the set of
subordinated Langevin equations proposed by Fogedby [33]:

where η(τ ) and ξ(τ ) are independent noises whose distributions are related

Since the relationship among PDFs K θ

α (see Appen-
dix), integral representation formulae (2.6a) and (2.6b) can be re-stated
also in terms of only the particle PDF K θ
α,β(x; t) with the opportune choice

Formula (2.6a), or the analog ones, shows that the solution of the
space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a) can be expressed in terms
of the solution of the space-fractional diﬀusion equation of order α, i.e.
K θ
α(x; t), and of the solution of the time-fractional diﬀusion
equation of order 2β, i.e. K 0
2,2β(τ ; t) = Mβ(τ ; t)/2, τ ≥ 0. Moreover, for-
mulae (2.6a) and (2.6b), or the analog ones, by involving non-negative func-
tions allow for interpreting K θ
α,β(x; t) as a PDF. Furthermore, it is worth
noting to remark that formula (2.6b), or the analog ones, is fundamental
to extend such probability interpretation to the range 1 < β ≤ α ≤ 2.
2.2. A new integral representation formula. By using formula (2.6a)
a new integral representation formula for the space-time fractional diﬀusion
can be derived. A preliminary derivation was presented in the proceedings
papers [78, 76].

Let K θ

Theorem 2.1.

α,β(x; t) be the fundamental solution of the
space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a) with initial and boundary
conditions u(x; 0) = δ(x) and u(±∞; t) = 0 and parameters α, θ, β such
that

0 < α ≤ 2 ,

|θ| ≤ min{α, 2 − α} ,

0 < β ≤ 1 ,

then the following integral representation formula holds true for 0 < x < ∞:

and

0 < η ≤ 2 ,

|γ| ≤ min{η, 2 − η} , 0 < ν ≤ 1 .

P r o o f. It is known that the following integral representation formula

for L´evy stable density holds [32, 61, 62]:

|θ| ≤ min{α, 2 − α} ,

0 < η ≤ 2 ,

0 < ν ≤ 1 .

Hence, inserting (2.11) into formula (2.6a) gives:

where the exchange of integration is allowed by the fact that the involved
functions are normalized PDFs. Using again (2.6a) to compute the integral
into braces in (2.13), since 0 < β ≤ 1, integral representation formula (2.10)
is obtained.

Corollary 2.1.

In the particular case η = 2 and γ = 0, so that ν =
α/2 and θ = 0, the spatial variable x emerges to be distributed according
to a Gaussian PDF and integral representation formula (2.10) becomes

Formula (2.14) involves the Gaussian PDF G(x, t) and can be stochas-
tically interpreted in diﬀerent ways, including that of a subordination pro-
cess. However, in the next section we will follow an alternative interpreta-
tion, which allows for deriving a new self-similar Gaussian-based stochastic
solution of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.4) with
Gaussian stationary increments.

3. The stochastic solution with Gaussian stationary increments

of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation

In this Section we propose a novel approach to obtain a new stochastic
solution Xα,β(t) of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation
(1.4) which has the valuable property to have stationary increments and
to be fully characterized. This method is based on the correspondence of

the PDFs resulting from the integral representation formula (2.14) with the
PDFs resulting from the product of two independent random variables.

This approach was preliminarly presented in the proceedings paper [76].

In general, the one-point one-time PDF is not suﬃcient to characterise a
stochastic process. In fact, starting from a Cauchy problem whose solution
can be interpreted as a PDF, there is an inﬁnity of stochastic processes that
share the same one-dimensional distribution. But, in the present approach,
the correspondence with the product of an appropriate random variable
and a Gaussian stochastic process, suggests a method to solve this indeter-
minacy. In particular, because the Gaussian process is fully charaterised.

It is well known that the PDF of the product of two independent ran-
dom variables is given by an integral formula [32, 61, 62]. The correspon-
dence between a parent-directing subordination and the product of two in-
dependent random variables for self-similar processes was also highlighted
in Reference [81]. This relationship is useful to establish classes of Hurst
Self-Similar with Stationary Increments (H-SSSI) stochastic processes to
model anomalous diﬀusion [81]. In this respect the following deﬁnition is
reminded:

Definition 3.1 (H-SSSI processes). A stochastic process W (t), t ≥ 0,
with values in R, is a H-SSSI process if: (i) it is a self-similar process, i.e.:
W (at) and aHW (t) have the same ﬁnite-dimensional distributions for all
a > 0, where H is the Hurst exponent; (ii) it has stationary increments,
i.e., the distribution of the increments W (t + τ ) − W (t) is invariant under
the time shift transformation: t → t + s.
First, the following lemma is given.

Lemma 3.1. Let Z1 and Z2 be two real independent random variables
whose PDFs are p1(z1) and p2(z2), respectively, with z1 ∈ R and z2 ∈ R+.
Let Z be the random variable obtained by the product of Z1 and Z γ
2 , i.e.:

Then, denoting with p(z) the PDF of Z, it results:

Z = Z1 Z γ

12

G. Pagnini, P. Paradisi

z2 < Z2 < z2 + dz2 is given by p(z1, z2)dz1dz2, where dz1dz2 is an in-
ﬁnitesimally small area. Relationship (3.1) suggests the following variable
transformation:

z1 = z/λγ ;

z2 = λ .

After the substitution of the above change of variables into the formula of
the probability, it follows:

p(z1, z2) dz1dz2 = p1(z/λγ)p2(λ) J dzdλ ,

where J = 1/λγ is the Jacobian of the transformation. Finally, integration
in dλ gives formula (3.2).
✷

It is here reminded that there is a formal correspondence between the
PDF of the product of two variables as stated in formula (3.2) and the
integral representation formula (2.14), such that it is possible to link the
mathematical expressions of the two PDFs.

By applying the changes of variables z = xt−γω and λ = τ t−ω, integral

representation (2.1) is recovered from (3.2) by setting

1

τ γ p1(cid:16) x

τ γ(cid:17) ≡ ψ(x; τ ) ,

tω(cid:17) ≡ ϕ(τ ; t) . (3.3)

Then, identifying functions and parameters in (3.3) as follows

tγω p(cid:16) x

tγω(cid:17) ≡ p(x; t) ,
p(z) ≡ K 0

(3.4a)

(3.4b)

p1(z1) ≡ G(z1) ,
γ = 1/2 , ω = 2β/α ,

formula (3.2) reduces to the new integral representation formula (2.14) for
the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation.

The correspondence between the two above mechanisms, namely for-
mulae (2.1) and (3.2), can be understood as follows [81]. Let W (t), t ≥ 0,
a H-SSSI process. Hence, if parameter a is turned into a random vari-
able, in the parent-directing subordination approach, the resulting process
emerges to be X(t) = Y (T (t)) = W (at) where it holds Y (τ ) = W (τ ) and
τ = T (t) = a t, and, in the approach based on the product of two indepen-
dent random variables, the resulting process is Z(t) = Z γ
2 Z1(t) = aH W (t)
where it holds Z γ
2 = aH and Z1(t) = W (t). Due to the self-similarity nature
of W (t), processes X(t) = W (at) and Z(t) = aHW (t) have the same ﬁnite-
dimensional distributions. This means that the process Z(t) has the same
single-point single-time density of a subordinated stochastic process where
the parent process Y (τ ) is a self-similar process, i.e. Y (τ ) = W (τ ), and
the operational time τ is a line with stochastic slope, i.e. τ = T (t) = a t.

In terms of random variables it follows that

Z = X t−β/α

and Z = Z1Z 1/2

13

hence it holds

X = Z tβ/α = Z1 tβ/α Z 1/2

(3.6)

2 = G2β/α(t)qΛα/2,β .

Since p1(z1) ≡ G(z1), Z1 is a Gaussian random variable (see (3.4a)). Con-
sequently, the stochastic process Z1tβ/α = G2β/α(t) is a Gaussian process
displaying anomalous diﬀusion. Further, the random variable Z2 = Λα/2,β
is distributed according to p2(z2) ≡ K −α/2

α/2,β(z2) (see (3.4a)).

The above reasoning is based on the same constructive approach adopted
by Mura [71] to built up the generalized grey Brownian motion [71, 73, 72,
21, 20]. In summary, we deﬁne the following class of H-SSSI processes:

Definition 3.2 (Gaussian-based H-SSSI stochastic processes). Let

Xα,β(t), t ≥ 0, be a H-SSSI process deﬁned by

Xα,β(t) =qΛα/2,β G2β/α(t) ,

0 < β ≤ 1 ,

0 < α ≤ 2 ,

(3.7)

where the stochastic process G2β/α(t) is a H-SSSI Gaussian process with
power law variance t2β/α and Λα/2,β is an independent constant non-negative
random variable distributed according to the PDF K −α/2
α/2,β(λ), λ ≥ 0, that
is a special case of (2.6a). Then we say that Xα,β(t) is a Gaussian-based
H-SSSI stochastic process.

The following theorem can be now proved.

Theorem 3.1 (Stochastic solution of equation (1.4)). The paramet-
ric class of Gaussian-based H-SSSI stochastic processes Xα,β(t) deﬁned in
(3.7), and depending on the paramenters 0 < β ≤ 1 and 0 < α ≤ 2, is a
class of stochastic solutions of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀu-
sion equation (1.4). This means that the one-time one-point PDF of Xα,β(t)
is the fundamental solution of equation (1.4), namely the PDF K 0
α,β(x; t)
deﬁned in (2.14).

P r o o f. For the given sequence of times (t1, ..., tn), the joint PDF fα,β
of the n-dimensional particle random vector X = (Xα,β(t1), ..., Xα,β (tn)) to
be in the position vector x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) can be derived from (3.2) and
(3.4a) by using the Kolmogorov extension theorem and it results to be

where γα,β(ti, tj) is the covariance matrix of the random vector correspond-
ing to the Gaussian process G2β/α(t) and [γα,β]−1 is the inverse covariance
matrix. The one-time one-point PDF (n = 1) is

(3.9)

where the scaling relationship x/tβ/α, which drives the anomalous diﬀusion
scaling, has been taken into account.

Formula (3.9) is the mathematical expression of the one-time one-point
PDF of the Gaussian-based H-SSSI stochastic process Xα,β(t) given in (3.7).
After the change of variable λ = τ t−2β/α, formula (3.9) can be rewritten
in the following way:

Considering self-similarity scaling, this expression is the same given in for-
mula (2.14), which is the integral representation formula for the solution of
the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.4).

Then, the equivalence of the two expressions (3.9) and (2.14) demon-
strates that the H-SSSI Gaussian-based stochastic process Xα,β(t), deﬁned
in equation (3.7), is a stochastic solution of the symmetric space-time frac-
tional diﬀusion equation (1.4), thus proving Theorem 3.1.
✷

It is worth noting that formula (3.9) represents a superposition of
Gaussian processes depending on the value of the random multiplicative

factorpΛα/2,β and that the process Xα,β(t) is Gaussian conditional on the

value of this multiplicative factor. The multiplicative factor can be under-
stood, for example, as related to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in analogy with
ideas discussed elsewhere [80, 77].

The stochastic process Xα,β(t) stated in (3.7) generalizes Gaussian pro-
cesses, which are recovered when α = 2 and β = 1. Similarly to Gaussian
process, even this process is uniquely determined by the mean and the au-
tocovariance structure. This property directly follows from the fact that
G2β/α(t) is a Gaussian stochastic process and Λα/2,β is an independent
constant non-negative random variable.

Before to discuss the numerical simulations it is highlighted that any
Gaussian process G2β/α(t) can be used to build up the stochastic solution
(3.7), because each Gaussian process is characterized by a particular co-
variance matrix. The following numerical simulations are performed by
choosing the standard fBm with Hurst exponent H = β/α < 1 as Gaussian

STOCHASTIC SOLUTION WITH GAUSSIAN . . .

15

stochastic process G2β/α(t). This choice constraints parameters α and β to
fall inside the intervals

0 < β ≤ 1 ,

0 < β < α ≤ 2 .

(3.11)

Note that after this choice the stochastic trajectories Xα,β(t) have Gaussian
stationary increments.

4. Numerical simulations

The fBm is the natural choice of the Gaussian process G2β/α(t) in the
formulation of the the Gaussian-based H-SSSI stochastic process Xα,β(t)
deﬁned in (3.7). The foundation of Xα,β(t) on the fBm is a remarkable
property, as it allows to reduce a large number of issues to the analysis of
the fBm, which has been largely studied (see, e.g., Reference [10]). More-
over, the stationarity of increments makes the stochastic process (3.7) more
eﬃcient for the simulations of stochastic trajectories by means of Monte
Carlo methods.

Now, given a set of time points (t1, t2, ..., tn), the fBm is deﬁned by the

following covariance matrix:

γα,β(ti, tj) = t2β/α

i

+ t2β/α

j

− |ti − tj|2β/α ,

i, j = 1, . . . , n .

(4.1)

In order to perform numerical simulations of the stochastic solution Xα,β(t)
stated in equation (3.7), both the generation of the random variable Λα/2,β,
distributed according to K −α/2
α/2,β(λ), and the fBm G2β/α(t) are here dis-
cussed.

From (2.13) and (2.10), according to (2.6a), it follows:

L−α/2

After the changes of variable ξ = t2β/αλ and τ = tβy, it holds:

0 < β ≤ 1 .

(4.4)

The representation integral (4.4) suggests that Λα/2,β can be computed by
means of the product of two independent random variables, see Section 3,
i.e.:

Λα/2,β = Λ1 · Λ2 = Lext

α/2 · M2/α

(4.5)

Finally, the random variable Λα/2,β is computed by the product

α/2 and Λ2 = Mβ are distributed according to the extremal

Then, from (2.8) and setting t = 1, it follows that the random variable
Mβ can be determined by an extremal stable random variable according
to [13]

In summary, the stochastic solution (3.7) of the symmetric space-time
fractional diﬀusion equation (1.4) is numerically simulated by the following
process

Regarding the fBm G2H (t), with Hurst exponent H = β/α and variance
2Hi = 2 t2H , the Hosking direct method is here applied for the range
hG2
0 < H < 1 [49, 26]. In particular, the so-called fractional Gaussian noise
(fGn) is ﬁrstly generated following its deﬁnition over the set of integer
numbers:
Y2H (n) = G2H (n + 1)− G2H (n) ⇔ G2H (n + 1) = G2H (n)+ Y2H (n) . (4.10)
Finally the fBm is generated as a sum of stationary increments, which
are generated according to the following stationary auto-correlation func-
tion, deﬁned over integer numbers (n ≥ 0):

Γx,2H(n) = hY2H(k)Y2H (k + n)i

=

1

2(cid:2)|n − 1|2H − |n|2H + |n + 1|2H(cid:3) .

(4.11)

By implementing the Hosking method, a set of stochastic trajectories,
i.e., sample paths, according to the fBm with Hurst exponent H = β/α

STOCHASTIC SOLUTION WITH GAUSSIAN . . .

17

were generated.
In order to obtain the corresponding trajectory of the
stochastic process of equation (3.7), each fBm sample path was then multi-

plied by the multiplicative factorpΛα/2,β . It is worth noting that Λα/2,β

is not a stochastic process evolving in time, but a constant random variable
characterizing the random wideness scale of the single sample path.

The numerical simulations were carried out, following the Monte Carlo
approach, by means of pseudo-random generators. For a given set of pa-
rameter values (α,β), the number of trajectories generated were 104 and
the number of time steps 103. Following equation (4.10), a unitary time
step was used as a natural choice to generate the stationary increments of
fBm. Changing the time scale requires changing the time step, and the as-
sociated trajectories can be simply derived without any further numerical
simulations by exploiting the self-similar property.

In Figs. 1-7 the results of numerical simulations have been reported
for four diﬀerent values of the Hurst exponent: H = 0.25, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9. In
Figs. 1-4 two diﬀerent couples of parameters (α,β), but giving the same
value of H = β/α, are compared. Some sample paths are reported for
each case (left panels) together with the corresponding PDF (right panels).
In the right panels the numerical PDFs are compared with the analytical
solutions of Eq. (1.1a) by means of a matching between the convergent
series (for x → 0) and the asymptotic expansions (for x → ±∞) as derived
in [57]. As expected, the spreading of trajectories increases as H increases,
with a dramatic increase in the neighborhood of H = 1 (see Fig. 4). It
is interesting to note that, in the process Xα,β(t), even if driven by the
fBm G2H (t), the most interesting eﬀects come from the random wideness
scale Λα/2,β, which is essentially given by the multiplication of two extremal
L´evy random variables. This means that a relatively smooth behaviour in
a great portion of sample paths is observed, in the sense that they show
similar random wideness scale going from one sample path to another.
However, a small but non-negligible subset of sample paths display very
diﬀerent random wideness scales, and this is in fact related to the random
variables Λα/2,β, characterizing the ensemble of sample paths. This can be
seen by comparing Fig. 6, where sample paths from a simple fBm with
H = 0.9 are reported, with the sample paths in Figs. 1-4. In fact, even if
the fBm sample paths show a great spreading (Fig. 6), at the same time
they show a much higher degree of uniformity of spanning over the sample
paths with respect to the sample paths shown in Figs. 1-4.

Another fundamental feature of the L´evy random wideness scale is clar-
iﬁed by comparing Fig. 4 (top panels) and Fig. 5. Figure 5 is a zoom of Fig.
4 (top panels), where only the sample paths with small wideness scales are
reported. This is caused by the L´evy-based random wideness scale Λα/2,β

in the range of large |X| (for each ﬁxed time). Notice that the stochas-
tic solution Xα,β(t), and the associated algorithm based on the fBm with
stationary increments and a random wideness scale, well reproduces this
power-law decay, as it is shown in Fig. 7 for the case of α = 0.5.

5. Discussion and conclusions

In order to provide a new microscopic physical insight to anomalous dif-
fusion, in the present paper we addressed the problem of ﬁnding a Gaussian-
based stochastic solution of the symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion
equation (1.4). The adopted method is based on the fact that the result-
ing PDFs from a new integral representation formula (2.10), which holds
for the fundamental solution of equation (1.1a), and from the product of
two independent variables are equal. The general integral representation
formula (2.10) turns to be the integral formula (2.14) when considering the
symmetric space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.4). This result is ex-
ploited to select a suitable independent constant and non-negative random
variable and a stochastic process that are used to build up, by means of

their product, the Gaussian-based H-SSSI stochastic process (3.7), whose
one-time one-point PDF is the solution of (1.4).

The fBm has been chosen as a natural prototype for the Gaussian pro-
cess driving this stochastic solution, but diﬀerent choices can be made for
the Gaussian part. Along this line, the stochastic process (3.7) emerges to
be the product of a fBm and an independent constant and non-negative
random variable distributed according to a combination of two extremal
L´evy distributions.

In literature, several stochastic solutions of the symmetric space-time
fractional equation (1.4) have been derived (see, e.g., References [33, 64, 97,
41]), but, up to our knowledge, the stochastic process Xα,β(t) here presented

in (3.7) is the ﬁrst stochastic solution that is also a H-SSSI process based
on a Gaussian process with stationary increments.

Moreover, process (3.7) shares with Gaussian processes and the gener-
alized grey Brownian motion [73], which is the stochastic solution of the
Erd´elyi–Kober fractional diﬀusion equation [74, 80], the valuable property
to be fully characterized by only the ﬁrst and second moments of the Gauss-
ian driving jumps (i.e., the temporal covariance matrix γα,β(ti, tj)).

The well known characteristic behaviour of anomalous diﬀusive pro-
cesses clearly emerge from the numerical simulations. In particular, when
α 6= 2, sample paths show very long jumps and these jumps generate the
power-law decay of the PDF.

Finally, valuable spatial and temporal characteristics can be obtained
with the derived stochastic solution about both the diﬀusive process and the
medium. Among these computable characteristics there are, for example,
the length and time scales associated to memory decay and to trapping
eﬀects, the diﬀusion features according to the Taylor–Green–Kubo formula
and also the occurrence of the ergodicity breaking. These features cannot

Appendix: The space-time fractional diﬀusion equation

Space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a) is obtained from the or-
dinary diﬀusion equation by replacing the ﬁrst order time derivative and
the second order space drivative with the Caputo time-fractional derivative
of real order β and the Riesz–Feller space-fractional derivative of real order
α, respectively. The Caputo time-fractional derivative tDβ
∗ is deﬁned by its
Laplace transform as

with m − 1 < β ≤ m and m ∈ N . The Riesz-Feller space-fractional
derivative xDθ

θ is deﬁned by its Fourier trasform according to

with α and θ as in (1.2).

In literature the time-fractional derivative is sometimes considered in

the Riemann–Liouville sense. The relationship of the time-fractional Riemann–
Liouville derivative with the time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense

However, it is possible to show that the fundamental solutions of (1.1a),
(A.4) and (A.5) are equal [41].

∂u

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

When 1 < β ≤ 2 a second initial condition is needed corresponding to
ut(x; 0) =
, and two Green functions follow according to the initial
conditions {u(x; 0) = δ(x) , ut(x; 0) = 0} and {u(x; 0) = 0 , ut(x; 0) = δ(x)},
respectively. However, this second Green function emerges to be a primi-
tive (with respect to the variable t) of the ﬁrst Green function, so that it
cannot be interpreted as a PDF because it is no longer normalized over x
[60]. Hence, solely the ﬁrst Green function can be considered for diﬀusion
problems.

In general, the fundamental solution K θ

α,β(x; t) algebraically decreases
as |x|−(α+1), thus it belongs to the domain of attraction of the L´evy stable
densities of index α. Moreover, K θ
α,β(x; t) obeys the following self-similarity,
or scaling, relationship:

K θ

α,β(x; t) = t−β/α K θ

(A.6)

α,β(cid:16) x

tβ/α(cid:17) ,

and it meets the following symmetry relation
α,β(−x; t) = K −θ
K θ

(A.7)
which allows for the restriction of the analysis to x ≥ 0. When x ≥ 0
the analytical solution of (1.1a) can be expressed by the following Mellin–
Barnes integral representation [79, 57]

The special cases of space-time fractional diﬀusion equation (1.1a) are

the following.

The space-fractional diﬀusion equation is obtained when {0 < α <

2 , β = 1} such that

K θ

α,1(x; t) = Lθ

α(x; t) = t−1/αLθ

0 < x < ∞ ,

(A.9)

α(cid:16) x
t1/α(cid:17) ,

where Lθ
α(x) is the class of strictly stable densities with algebraic tail de-
caing as |x|−(α+1) and inﬁnite variance, where α and θ are the scaling
and asymmetry parameters, respectively. Moreover, stable PDFs with
0 < α < 1 and extremal value of the asymmetry parameter θ are one-
sided with support R+

0 if θ = +α.

0 if θ = −α and R−

The time-fractional diﬀusion equation is obtained when {α = 2, 0 <

β < 2} such that
2,β(x; t) =

K 0

Mβ/2(x; t) =

t−β/2Mβ/2(cid:16) x

tβ/2(cid:17) ,

x ≥ 0 ,

(A.10)

where Mν(x), 0 < ν < 1, is the M-Wright/Mainardi density [59, 58, 12, 13,
14, 75, 82] which has stretched exponential tails and ﬁnite variance growing
in time with the power law tβ. Since α = 2, according to (1.2), it holds
θ = 0, then the PDF is symmetric and the extension to −∞ < x < +∞ is
obtained by replacing x with |x| in (A.10).

The neutral fractional diﬀusion equation is obtained when {0 < α =
β < 2} whose solution can be expressed in explicit form by non-negative
simple elementary functions [95, 57], i.e., when x ≥ 0
K θ

(x/t)α−1 sin[ π

α,α(x; t) = N θ

α(x; t) =

1 + 2(x/t)α cos[ π

t−1
π

2 (α − θ)] + (x/t)2α .

Recently Luchko [54] has considered and analyzed the case 1 < α < 2
and θ = 0 of (A.11). Moreover, the PDF given in equation (A.11), with
0 < α < 1, emerged in the study of ﬁnite Larmor radius eﬀects on non-
diﬀusive tracer transport in a zonal ﬂow [47]. Numerical evidences of the
same PDF also emerged in non-diﬀusive chaotic transport by Rossby waves
in zonal ﬂow [23].

The local classical diﬀusion equation is obtained when {α = 2, β = 1},
and its Gaussian solution is recovered as a limiting case from both the space-
fractional (α = 2) and the time-fractional (β = 1) diﬀusion equations, i.e.,

K 0

2,1(x; t) = L0

{α = 2, β = 2}, and it holds
