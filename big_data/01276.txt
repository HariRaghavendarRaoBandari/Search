ABSTRACT
We compare the set of local galaxies having dynamically measured black holes with a large,
unbiased sample of galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We conﬁrm earlier
work showing that the majority of black hole hosts have signiﬁcantly higher velocity disper-
sions σ than local galaxies of similar stellar mass. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to illus-
trate the effect on black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that the
black hole sphere of inﬂuence must be resolved to measure black hole masses with spatially
resolved kinematics. We ﬁnd that this selection effect artiﬁcially increases the normalization
of the Mbh-σ relation by a factor of at least ∼ 3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even
larger. Our Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both
indicate that σ is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In particular, the Mbh-
Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-σ and σ-Mstar relations, and is heavily
biased by up to a factor of 50 at small masses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between
dynamically-based black hole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our
simulations also disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at ﬁxed σ. Correcting
for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate black hole masses in active
galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir ∼ 1. Black hole mass densities should also be
proportionally smaller, perhaps implying signiﬁcantly higher radiative efﬁciencies/black hole
spins. Reducing black hole masses also reduces the gravitational wave signal expected from
black hole mergers.

1 INTRODUCTION

The presence of nuclear supermassive black holes (hereafter black
hole) in the majority of local galaxies has become an accepted
paradigm. Indeed, nuclear kinematics of a number of nearby
galaxies show the clear signature of a central mass concentration,
beyond what can be attributed to the observed stellar population

in the nuclear regions. Black hole masses, Mbh, are found to
correlate with several global properties of their host galaxies
(see, e.g., Ferrarese & Ford 2005; Shankar 2009; Kormendy & Ho
2013; Graham 2016, for reviews), including the stellar and/or
bulge mass, velocity dispersion, σ, luminosity, light concentration
or S´ersic index (e.g., Magorrian et al. 1998; Richstone et al.
1998;
2000;
Graham et al. 2001; Graham & Driver 2007a; Marconi & Hunt

Graham 2012; Kormendy & Ho 2013; McConnell & Ma 2013;
Scott et al. 2013; L¨asker et al. 2014; Savorgnan & Graham 2015a;
Savorgnan et al. 2015; Saglia et al. 2016), and the mass of the
surrounding dark matter halo (e.g., Ferrarese 2002a; Baes et al.
2003; Bogd´an & Goulding 2015; Sabra et al. 2015). However,
while it is true that the number of dynamical black hole mass
measurements has increased over the years, such samples still
remain relatively small, of the order of ∼ 70 − 80 galaxies. This is
due primarily to the difﬁculty of carrying out direct measurements
with the required depth and spatial resolution (see, e.g., Faber
1999; Ferrarese & Ford 2005, for reviews on the challenges
encountered in these observational campaigns).

Understanding the origin and reliability of these correlations
is vital if we want to ultimately improve our understanding of
galaxy-black hole (co-)evolution. For instance, the normalization
and slope of the Mbh-σ relation may contain key information on
whether feedback is primarily via energy or momentum transfer
(e.g., Silk & Rees 1998; Fabian 1999; King 2005; Wyithe & Loeb
2005; Fabian 2012; King 2014). Directly related to the normaliza-
tion of the black hole scaling relations is the value of the virial fvir-
factor used to derive the masses of black holes probed via reverber-
ation mapping studies (Onken et al. 2004; Vestergaard & Peterson
2006). If the Mbh-σ normalization is too high by some amount,
then the fvir-factor will be too high by this same amount. Shifting
the normalization to lower masses will not only lower the quasar
masses inferred at high-z, thus helping to solve the problem of the
time required to grow the black hole by accretion, but an abundance
of lower-mass black holes, now with Mbh < 105 M⊙ (e.g, “in-
termediate mass black holes”), will be realized, joining the ranks
of objects like HLX-1 in ESO 243-49 (Farrell et al. 2009, 2014;
Webb et al. 2014) and NGC 2276-3c (Mezcua et al. 2015).

The normalization of

the Mbh-Mbulge

in predicting what pulsar

relation is also
a key ingredient
timing array
searches (e.g., Sesana et al. 2008; Hobbs et al. 2010; Sesana 2013;
Kramer & Champion 2013; Rosado & Sesana 2014; Rosado et al.
2015) for gravitational radiation will see (Bonnor & Rotenberg
1961; Peres 1962; Bekenstein 1973; Buonanno & Damour 2000;
Berti et al. 2009). With the normalizations currently in use, the pul-
sar timing arrays were expected to have detected a gravitational
wave background (Shannon et al. 2013, 2015). To explain the lack
of detection, theorists have begun to consider new possibilities, like
rather eccentric orbits for the coalescing binary supermassive black
hole population so as to shift the gravitational wave spectral energy
distribution out of the observing window of pulsar timing arrays.
However, eccentric orbits are at odds with the observed ellipticities
of partially-depleted cores (see, e.g., Dullo & Graham 2015). En-
vironmental effects are also being invoked to reduce the time over
which the binary emits gravitational radiation, and thus possibly
resolve the dilemma (e.g., Ravi et al. 2014). However, if the Mbh-
Mbulge normalization on which these arguments are based is too
high, then the expected gravitational wave signal has been over-
estimated.

Scatter in the black-hole galaxy scaling relations is thought
to bear imprints of the amount of collisionless “dry mergers” ex-
perienced by the (most massive) hosts (e.g., Boylan-Kolchin et al.
2006; Peng 2007; Hirschmann et al. 2010; Jahnke & Macci`o 2011,
but see Savorgnan & Graham 2015a). The S´ersic index and the
presence of a partially depleted core, along with their possible cor-
relations with the mass of the central black hole, are also believed
to contain information about the types of mergers responsible for
shaping the host spheroids (e.g., Aguerri et al. 2001; Merritt 2006;
Hilz et al. 2013; Graham & Scott 2013, 2015).

Beyond the local universe, data tracking the evolution of
active and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time shows that
black hole accretion and star formation peak at similar epochs
(e.g., Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni 2004; Silverman et al. 2008;
Zheng et al. 2009; Shankar et al. 2009b; Delvecchio et al. 2014),
consistent with the idea that massive black holes and their host
galaxies may be co-evolving. One way to test this co-evolution is by
exploring the cosmic evolution of the above scaling relations. Thus,
the characterization of the scaling relations of black holes with their
hosts is the subject of intense observational efforts, both locally
and at high redshift (e.g., Shields et al. 2006; Lauer et al. 2007b;
Treu et al. 2007; Woo et al. 2008; Gaskell & Kormendy 2009;
Shankar et al. 2009a; Merloni et al. 2010; Schulze & Wisotzki
2011; Falomo et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2015).

In-depth knowledge of the black hole-host scaling relations
at any epoch can also potentially provide statistical clues on
the mass densities of black holes. For instance, a robust es-
timate of the black hole mass function can provide valuable
constraints on the mechanisms governing black hole growth
over cosmic time, such as mergers or disc instabilities (e.g.,
Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Vittorini et al. 2005; Bower et al.
2006; Lapi et al. 2006; Menci et al. 2006; Malbon et al. 2007;
Shankar et al. 2009b; Bournaud et al. 2011; Fanidakis et al. 2011;
?; Dubois et al. 2013; Hirschmann et al. 2014; Sesana et al. 2014;
Aversa et al. 2015; Fontanot et al. 2015; Sijacki et al. 2015), as
well as on the average radiative efﬁciencies/black hole spin and/or
fraction of obscured sources (e.g., Soltan 1982; Elvis et al. 2002;
Shankar et al. 2013b; Aversa et al. 2015; Tucci & Volonteri 2016).
However, because direct dynamical measurements of black hole
masses are difﬁcult to obtain, considerable effort has been in-
vested in identifying easily observed proxies for Mbh. As an
example, the standard procedure for calculating the black hole
“mass function” has been to assume that all galaxies host black
holes, and to use the correlation between the observable proxy and
Mbh to transform the observed distribution of the proxy into a
distribution of Mbh (e.g., Salucci et al. 1999; Aller & Richstone
2002; Ferrarese 2002b; McLure & Dunlop 2004; Marconi et al.
2004; Shankar et al. 2004; Benson et al. 2007; Tundo et al. 2007;
Graham et al. 2007; Yu & Lu 2008; Vika et al. 2009).

This procedure rests on the assumption that one has correctly
identiﬁed the observable proxy for Mbh, and that the scaling rela-
tion used to convert from it to Mbh has been correctly estimated.
For example, the two most commonly used proxies, stellar velocity
dispersion and bulge luminosity, lead to rather different estimates
of φ(Mbh) (e.g., Lauer et al. 2007a; Tundo et al. 2007, but see also
Graham 2008): the luminosity-based estimate predicts many more
massive black holes. To date, there is no consensus on which is
correct, at least for the more massive galaxies. There is also no
consensus on whether or not the best proxy for Mbh involves more
than one observable. For example, some groups (e.g. Feoli & Mele
2005; Hopkins et al. 2007) argue that Mbh ∝ R2−β/2σβ, with R
any characteristic (e.g., half-light) radius of the host galaxy and
β ≈ 3, whereas, on the basis of more recent samples, Beiﬁori et al.
(2012) report no compelling evidence for anything other than
Mbh ∝ σβ with β ≈ 4, in line with Graham (2008). Notice that the
second parameter in the Feoli & Mele (2005) formulation becomes
less important when β → 4.

However, the two issues above are coupled: one cannot prop-
erly address the observable proxy question if the scaling rela-
tions have been incorrectly estimated. While there exists a wealth
of literature on measuring these relations in the local dynamical
black hole samples (e.g., Ford et al. 1998; Yu & Tremaine 2002;

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1– 22

Novak et al. 2006; Lauer et al. 2007b; Graham 2007; Batcheldor
2010; Merloni et al. 2010; Graham et al. 2011; Beiﬁori et al. 2012;
Graham & Scott 2013; Schulze & Wisotzki 2014), the extent to
which selection effects can bias these estimates has not been fully
addressed. This matters because, as pointed out by Bernardi et al.
(2007) almost a decade ago, the available black hole samples
are not a representative subset of early-type galaxies: their host
galaxies have larger than expected velocity dispersions than early
type galaxies of the same luminosity or stellar mass. Although
Yu & Tremaine (2002) had also noted that σ-L in black hole sam-
ples appeared to be biased – and van den Bosch et al. (2015) have
recently reconﬁrmed that black hole hosts tend to be the densest
galaxies given their luminosity – they ignored the implications for
black hole scaling relations. Bernardi et al. (2007) used analytic ar-
guments and Monte-Carlo simulations to show that this is unwise
– selection effects can heavily bias black hole scaling relations.

There is at least one obvious selection effect: direct black
hole mass estimates depend on resolving (at least approximately)
the sphere of inﬂuence rinﬂ ≡ GMbh/σ2 of the black hole (e.g.
Peebles 1972; Ford et al. 1998; Merritt & Ferrarese 2001; Barth
2004; Batcheldor 2010; Graham et al. 2011; G¨ultekin et al. 2011).
This, at ﬁxed signal-to-noise ratio, becomes more difﬁcult as the
distance to the black hole increases. The ﬁrst part of this paper is
devoted to a study of this selection effect. In the second, we address
the question of which scaling relation is more fundamental.

When cosmological parameters are necessary, we set h = 0.7,

Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7.

2 DATA

The galaxy sample used as the reference data in this study is
the one collected and studied in Meert et al. (2015), and we refer
to that paper for full details. Brieﬂy, galaxies are selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 spectroscopic sample
(Abazajian et al. 2009) in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.2,
and with a morphology classiﬁcation based on the Bayesian auto-
mated morphological classiﬁer by Huertas-Company et al. (2011).
The latter statistically quantiﬁes the morphological appearance of
a galaxy with probabilities p(E–S0) of being an elliptical (E), a
lenticular (S0), and a spiral, based on several different criteria. Un-
less otherwise noted, we will always deﬁne the sample of ellipti-
cals/lenticulars as those SDSS galaxies with a p(E–S0) > 0.80,
though the exact cut chosen to select early-type galaxies in SDSS
does not impact any of our conclusions.

Galaxy mass-to-light ratios were obtained from the MPA-JHU
DR7 release, derived through Spectral Energy Distribution ﬁtting
using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) synthesis population models,
and converted to a Chabrier (2003) Initial Mass Function (IMF).
Stellar masses are obtained by multiplying these mass-to-light ra-
tios by the luminosity. Bernardi et al. (2013, 2014, 2016) have em-
phasized that the choice of luminosity matters as much as the
choice of IMF. They provide three different estimates for the stel-
lar masses: one based on the SDSS CMODEL magnitude; another,
based on ﬁtting a single S´ersic proﬁle S´ersic (1963); and a third,
SEREXP, based on a combination of S´ersic and exponential light
proﬁles. Unless we specify otherwise, all (circularized) galaxy ef-
fective radii and luminosities – and hence stellar masses – which
follow are based on their SEREXP ﬁts (also see Meert et al. 2015).
While this choice matters quantitatively, it makes no qualitative dif-
ference to our ﬁndings.

SMBHs: selection bias and its consequences

3

We will consider ﬁve different black hole samples1 : those
of Savorgnan et al. (2015), L¨asker et al. (2014), McConnell & Ma
(2013), Beiﬁori et al. (2012), and Saglia et al. (2016). The other
ﬁve samples are based on the same sample of local galaxies with
dynamical mass measurements of the central black hole, but with
different estimates of the host galaxy velocity dispersion and lumi-
nosity.

The sample of Savorgnan et al. (2015) is the largest, most
up-to-date set of galaxies with dynamically measured black
holes. It consists of 66 galaxies with dynamical estimates of
their black hole masses as reported by Graham & Scott (2013)
or Rusli et al. (2013). Using 3.6µ (Spitzer satellite) images,
Savorgnan & Graham (2015b) modelled the one-dimensional sur-
face brightness proﬁle (measured along the major-axis and also the
equivalent-circularized axis, i.e. the “circularized” proﬁle) of each
one of these 66 galaxies and estimated the structural parameters of
their spheroidal component by simultaneously ﬁtting a S´ersic func-
tion (used to describe the spheroid) in combination with additional
components such as bars, discs, rings, nuclei. When available, kine-
matic information was used to conﬁrm the presence and radial ex-
tent of rotating discs in the early-type galaxies.

Galaxy luminosities were converted into stellar masses as-
suming a Chabrier IMF and adopting a constant mass-to-light ra-
tio of (M/M⊙)/(L/L⊙) = 0.6 from Meidt et al. (e.g. 2014).
Savorgnan et al. (2015) also explored more sophisticated ways of
computing stellar masses based on colours, ﬁnding similar results.
The total galaxy effective radii (measured along the major- and the
equivalent-axis) were estimated from the one-dimensional cumula-
tive distribution of light as a function of galaxy radius, i.e., by im-
posing that the observed surface brightness proﬁle integrated from
R = 0 to R = Re equal half of the total brightness. To these galaxy
radii we assign a typical average uncertainty of 0.1 dex. Central
velocity dispersions are all derived from Hyperleda. In the follow-
ing we exclude from their original sample NGC3842, NGC4889,
UGC3789, and IC2560 which do not have Hyperleda velocity dis-
persions. We also remove another 10 galaxies that Kormendy & Ho
(2013) classify either as ongoing mergers or as having uncertain
black hole mass estimates (see their Tables 2 and 3). Finally, we
do not consider the four galaxies for which Savorgnan et al. (2015)
report only upper limits to the total magnitude (see their Table 1).
This limits the ﬁnal sample to 48 galaxies, of which 37 are E–S0
galaxies.

The photometry characterizing the L¨asker et al. (2014) sam-
ple of 35 galaxies, selected among those available in the literature
with “secure” dynamical black hole mass measurements, was de-
termined from deep, high spatial resolution images obtained from
the wide-ﬁeld WIRCam imager at the Canada–France–Hawaii–
Telescope, accompanied by dedicated sky subtraction and im-
proved ﬁtting techniques similar to those by Savorgnan & Graham
(2015b). To make a closer comparison with the other black hole
samples and SDSS galaxies we adopt as a reference their stan-
dard S´ersic plus exponential luminosities, but note that using their
“improved” luminosities – based on more complex ﬁtting models
that may include additional components other than bulge and disc
– does not alter our conclusions. We convert their K-band lumi-
nosities into stellar masses assuming a Chabrier IMF adopting an
average standard mass-to-light ratio of (M/M⊙)/(L/L⊙) = 0.67

1 We do not show results from Kormendy & Ho (2013) because their pho-
tometry is not as accurate as the others and they do not provide effective
radii.

F. Shankar et al.

(e.g., Longhetti & Saracco 2009). Velocity dispersions are all taken
from Hyperleda.

From the original sample of McConnell & Ma (2013) we re-
tain only those objects which Kormendy & Ho (2013) label as se-
cure, and further restrict to those with 3.6µ luminosities and ef-
fective radii derived from S´ersic plus exponential ﬁts by Sani et al.
(2011). This reduces the original sample to 34 galaxies, of which 26
are E–S0s. We adopt their velocity dispersions obtained from inte-
gration of the spatially resolved measurements of the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion and radial velocity from the sphere of inﬂuence
of the black hole to one effective radius. The latter deﬁnition can
reduce the values of central velocity dispersion by 10%-15% but,
according to McConnell & Ma (2013), more accurately reﬂects the
global structure of the host galaxy and is less sensitive to angular
resolution.

The structural parameters in Beiﬁori et al. (2012) are also ho-
mogeneously derived from bulge-to-disc decompositions of SDSS
i-band images. Stellar masses were derived from adopting the
mass-to-light ratio versus colour relations by Bell et al. (2003),
who in turn adopted a “diet” Salpeter IMF, which yields about 0.15
dex higher stellar masses than a Chabrier IMF (e.g., Bernardi et al.
2010). Stellar velocity dispersions come either from Beiﬁori et al.
(2009) or G¨ultekin et al. (2009) and are rescaled to a velocity dis-
persion σ equivalent to an effective stellar dispersion, measured
within a circular aperture of radius Re. When showing correlations
with black hole mass, we will restrict to the subsample of galax-
ies by Beiﬁori et al. (2012) with updated black hole masses from
Kormendy & Ho (2013).

To couple these datasets with SDSS galaxies, we convert
SDSS velocity dispersions from Re/8 to Re using the mean aper-
ture corrections in Cappellari et al. (2006):

(cid:18) σR
σe (cid:19) = (R/Re)−0.066 .

(1)

When dealing with the velocity dispersions σHL from the Hyper-
leda database (Paturel et al. 2003), in which all measurements have
been homogenized to a common aperture of 0.595 kpc, we also
correct according to Equation 1. These corrections are relatively
small, and are not crucial for our results. The aperture correction
in Equation 1 is consistent with other independent works (e.g.,
Jorgensen et al. 1996). Cappellari et al. (2013) claim a slight mass-
dependent aperture correction, as expected in pressure-supported
systems (Graham & Colless 1997), though still, on average, in
good agreement with Equation 1.

While our work was being reviewed for publication,
Saglia et al. (2016) reported results from the SINFONI black hole
survey. For completeness, we brieﬂy report results derived from
their sample in Section 4.6 and Appendix A. Bulge luminosities
and half-light radii provided with this sample are determined from
photometric decompositions that include bulges, discs, bars and
rings. Bulge luminosities are then converted to stellar masses via
dynamically determined mass-to-light ratios, and velocity disper-
sions are computed as line-of-sight weighted means within one ef-
fective radius. We remove from this sample 11 galaxies classiﬁed
as unreliable by Kormendy & Ho (2013).

3 SELECTION BIAS

are available differ from those of the early-type population as a
whole: black hole hosts tend to have larger velocity dispersions
than early type galaxies of the same luminosity. Figure 1 shows
that this bias is still present in the four more recent compila-
tions/determinations (different panels) described in the previous
section. The solid line with grey bands shows the velocity disper-
sion σ-total stellar mass Mstar relation of SDSS galaxies having
probability p(E–S0) > 0.80 of being classiﬁed as ellipticals and/or
lenticulars according to the Bayesian automated classiﬁcation of
Huertas-Company et al. (2011). The symbols in each panel show
the E–S0 galaxies with dynamically measured black hole masses:
in all panels, they lie signiﬁcantly above the relation deﬁned by
the full SDSS. We note that the SerExp decompositions assign
larger luminosities to the galaxies with the highest velocity dis-
persions (e.g. Bernardi et al. 2013, 2014, 2016), thus further curv-
ing the σ-Mstar relation (and related bias) with respect to previous
estimates based on deVaucouleur’s luminosities (e.g., Tundo et al.
2007; Bernardi et al. 2010, 2011).

Graham (2008)

argued that

the bias discussed

by
(2007) was almost entirely due to lenticular
Bernardi et al.
and/or barred galaxies. However, an error in Figure 7 of that
paper invalidates this conclusion. To double-check, the orange
symbols in each panel of our Figure 1 show lenticulars: the larger
bias is evident in the McConnell & Ma (2013, upper left) and
Savorgnan et al. (2015, upper right) samples, but is less obvious in
the bottom right panel. Even if these objects are excluded, there
is a clear offset from the relation deﬁned by the SDSS galaxies.
Indeed, in the Beiﬁori et al. (2012) sample (bottom left) we have
excluded all barred galaxies, and still ﬁnd a clear offset. The offsets
are evident whatever the exact sample considered, the selection
adopted,
the possible differences in estimating stellar masses
in each subsample, and the aperture within which the velocity
dispersion was estimated. In Section 4.6 we show there is also a
clear offset if one considers bulge instead of total stellar masses
(the SEREXP decompositions provide B/T estimates for the SDSS
sample).

If the offset is a physical effect – only the densest galaxies
host black holes (e.g., Saglia et al. 2016)– then it compromises the
fundamental assumption in black hole demographic studies based
on proxies: that all galaxies host black holes. However, there is a
well-known selection effect: black hole dynamical mass estimates
are only possible if (some multiple of) the black hole’s sphere of
inﬂuence,

rinﬂ ≡ GMbh/σ2,

has been resolved (e.g., Peebles 1972; Merritt & Ferrarese
2001; Barth 2004; Batcheldor 2010; G¨ultekin et al. 2011;
Graham & Scott 2013). The next section explores the consequences
of this selection effect.

galaxies with a probability p(E–S0) > 0.80 of being classiﬁed as ellipticals and/or lenticulars (see text for details). The solid line in each panel shows the
mean relation in the SDSS, based on the SEREXP stellar masses of Meert et al. 2015; gray band shows the dispersion around the mean. The symbols show the
local E–S0 galaxies with dynamically measured black hole masses from McConnell & Ma (2013, top, left), Savorgnan et al. (2015, top right), Beiﬁori et al.
(2012, bottom left), and L¨asker et al. (2014, bottom right). Filled red circles in each panel show ellipticals; green triangles show lenticulars. Open circles in
the upper right panel mark the galaxies classiﬁed as barred by Savorgnan et al. (2015). In all panels, most black hole hosts lie above the relations deﬁned by
the local population of SDSS galaxies regardless of morphological type.

characteristic resolution limit for space-based (Hubble space tele-
scope) observations. We have veriﬁed that none of our conclusions
is signiﬁcantly changed if we increase the critical radius to, say,
θcrit = 0.5′′, which is more typical for ground-based measure-
ments, Of course, increasing θcrit decreases the number of de-
tectable objects. In addition, the bias does not scale linearly with
θcrit so a weak trend with resolution is expected. Finally, we stress
that this may not be the only selection effect in real samples; our
goal is to study this effect in isolation.

which is uniform in comoving volume out to 200 Mpc2. This cut-

irrelevant.

2 This value was chosen to broadly match the outermost distance for dy-
namical measurements of black holes (e.g., Cygnus A, Kormendy & Ho
2013). Reducing it to 100-150 Mpc does not qualitatively change any of
our conclusions.

selection-biased sample.

Model II was chosen because it is similar to the observed (se-
lection biased) scaling reported in the literature (e.g., Hopkins et al.
2007; Kormendy & Ho 2013; McConnell & Ma 2013). Model I has
a stronger intrinsic dependence on σ which we argue later is re-
quired to explain all the observed correlations. And Model III was
chosen mainly because it scales like the potential energy, so σ does
not play a fundamental role; rather, in this model, the Mbh-σ corre-
lation is a result of more fundamental correlations with Mstar and
Re. While our choices for the intrinsic scatter are close to those re-
ported in the literature, for reasons that will become clear later, the
normalizations γ in all the three models above are ∼ 0.4 − 0.6 dex
(∼ 2.5 − 4×) lower than the values given in the literature.

Notice that we do not distinguish between intrinsic scatter and
observational errors in our Monte Carlo simulations: we return to
this later. In addition, while all the mock-based results that fol-
low are presented in terms of total stellar mass, using bulge stellar
masses (and radii) instead yields qualitatively similar results (see
Section 4.6).

4.2 The selection biased σ-Mstar and Re-Mstar relations

In this section we answer the basic question: can the rinﬂ-selection
effect help explain the discrepancy shown in Figure 1? We will use
“scaling relations” to address this. In all cases, this means we treat
the quantity plotted on the y-axis as the dependent variable when
ﬁtting. We never treat it as the independent variable, nor do we per-
form ‘bisector’-like ﬁts. When ﬁtting straight lines to the data, we
have compared three different linear regression algorithms ﬁnding
very similar results. The values we report have been performed with
the IDL routine robust linfit.

In the next two ﬁgures, red circles and grey squares show
200 randomly chosen members of the intrinsic and selection bi-
ased Monte-Carlo samples, and blue symbols with error bars show
the E+S0s in the Savorgnan et al. (2015) dataset. Long-dashed red
curves show the intrinsic scaling relations, solid black lines show
linear ﬁts to the selection biased sample, and short-dashed blue
lines show linear ﬁts to the data.

The top panels of Figure 2 show the σ-Mstar relation: left,
middle, and right-hand panels show results for Models I, II and III.
There is a clear offset between the intrinsic and selection biased
objects in the top left panel, a smaller one in the top middle, and
a bias in the opposite sense in the top right panel. This is easy to
understand: In Model II, rinﬂ ∝ (Mstarσ)0.5 is nearly a function
of Mstar only (the range of Mstar values is much broader than of
σ). Correlations with the variable on which the selection was made
will be unbiased, and, since the correlation shown is at ﬁxed Mstar,
the rinﬂ selection does not bias the σ-Mstar relation in the middle
panel very much. However, in Model I, rinﬂ ∝ M 0.5
starσ2.5 is nearly
a function of σ only, so requiring θinﬂ > θcrit will tend to select
large σ, which is what we see in the left hand panel. In contrast,
rinﬂ ∝ (M 2
star/Re)/σ2 in Model III, so θinﬂ > θcrit tends to
select small σ in the right hand panel.

Comparison with the blue symbols in the top panels shows
that Model I is remarkably similar to the data, whereas Models II
and III are not. The discrepancy between the σ-Mstar relation in
the selection-biased sample and the data (i.e., the Savorgnan et al.
2015 E+S0s) is most pronounced in Model III, because it has no σ
factor in Mbh to cancel the σ2 factor in the deﬁnition of rinﬂ, so
the selection biased sample is composed of objects with smaller σ
(rather than larger) for their Mstar.

For completeness, the bottom panels of Figure 2 show a sim-
ilar analysis of the Re-Mstar relation. Model II is nearly unbiased

from the full and selection biased subsamples, respectively. Red long-dashed and black solid curves show the associated mean values of Mbh as σ and Mstar
vary. Resolving the black hole sphere of inﬂuence biases the observed relations so that they lie signiﬁcantly above the intrinsic ones; they overestimate Mbh
by factors of 3× or more. Blue symbols with error bars show the Savorgnan et al. (2015) dataset which is only really matched by the (selection biased) Model

by the selection effect for the same reason as before; and while
there is a small bias (to slightly smaller Re) in models I and III, it
is much smaller than for σ-Mstar. 3 All the models are in reason-
able agreement with the Savorgnan et al. (2015) data.

3 The slight bias can be understood in terms of the virial theorem: at ﬁxed
Mstar, large σ means smaller Re, and we know that the selection effect
in Model I favours large σ. The bias appears small because the intrinsic
Re-Mstar relation is tighter, i.e. has less scatter, than the σ-Mstar relation.

4.3 Selection-biased Mbh scaling relations

Having shown that the selection biased samples are similar to the
data – with Model I faring better than the other two models for σ-
Mstar (in general, the dependence on velocity dispersion, labelled
by the slope β, must be large to explain the observed offset in the
σ-Mstar relation) – and that the selection biased Model I sample is
biased compared to the intrinsic σ-Mstar relation – we now turn to
correlations with Mbh.

tions in our Monte Carlo simulations based on Model I (top), Model

Figure 4. Scatter around the mean relations for the mock catalogues shown in Figure 3. Long-dashed red lines mark the intrinsic scatter around the mean
relations; solid black lines show the scatter in the selection-biased subsamples. The decreasing scatter in the Mbh-Mstar relation for Model I (upper right),
which is ampliﬁed in the selection biased sample, is a direct consequence of the fact that the scatter around the mean σ-Mstarrelation decreases at large Mstar
(Figure 1).

II (middle), and Model III (bottom). All models predict biased scal-
ing relations that have higher normalizations and in some cases ﬂat-
ter slopes than the intrinsic ones. This is the main reason why we
chose lower normalization factors γ for all our Monte-Carlo mod-
els (cfr. Section 4.1). This bias becomes more pronounced as the
input slope β or the input scatter increase (also see discussion of
Figure 9). This is why the bias induces a stronger upwards boost
in the Mbh-Mstar relation for Model I than Model II or III (right
panels).

In addition, notice the curvature in the intrinsic Mbh-Mstar
relation (long-dashed red lines in the panels on the right), which
is most evident for Model I. Since Equation 4, which we used to
generate Mbh, assumes pure power-law relations, this curvature is
entirely a consequence of curvature in the σ-Mstar relation (Fig-
ure 1). Curvature in the observed (selection biased) Mbh-Mbulge
relation has been reported by Graham & Scott (2013). Our analysis

suggests that this curvature is due to galaxy formation physics, and
need not imply anything fundamental about black hole formation or
mergers (see also Fontanot et al. 2015). The intrinsic Mbh-Mstar
relation in Model I can be approximated by

Figure 5. Correlations between residuals from the observed scaling relations, as indicated. Red circles and green triangles show E and S0 galaxies from the
Savorgnan et al. (2015) E–S0 sample, while grey bands show the corresponding measurements in our (selection biased) Model I. The selection bias tends to
reduce the slope of the Mbh-σ relation (from β = 4.5 to ∼ 4), so solid lines in panels on the left show a slope of 4. In the panels on the right, solid lines with
a slope of 0.4 approximate the expected scalings with stellar mass or effective radius in the biased samples. Correlations with velocity dispersion appear to be
stronger than those with the other two quantities, in good agreement with Model I.

Having illustrated the bias in the mean relations, we now con-
sider the scatter around the relations, computed in our mocks as
the 1σ dispersion around the mean. The six panels in Figure 4
are for the same relations shown in Figure 3: the long-dashed, red
lines show the scatter in the full sample (i.e., the scatter around the
long-dashed red lines in Figure 3), and the black solid lines show
the scatter measured in the selection biased subsample (the scatter
around the black lines in Figure 3). In all models, the scatter in the
biased samples is comparable to, or as much as ∼ 30% smaller
than, the intrinsic scatter. Although the data are too sparse to allow
a reliable determination of the scatter, they do show a tendency to
decrease at large masses which is in qualitative agreement with our
simulations.

It is sometimes argued that because the observed scatter
around the Mbh-Mstar relation is of the same magnitude as that
around the Mbh-σ relation, especially in early-type, massive galax-
ies, it is plausible that the Mbh-Mstar relation is at least as, if
not more, fundamental. However, the top panels show that this ar-
gument is ﬂawed because in Model I velocity dispersion is more
important than stellar mass: the scatter around the observed Mbh-
Mstar relation seems comparable to the one on the left panel, espe-
cially at large masses, because of the selection effect. In addition,
some groups have reported a tendency for the scatter to decrease
at large Mstar (e.g., McConnell & Ma 2013), and have interpreted
this as a signature of black hole-black hole mergers (e.g., Peng

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1– 22

2007; Jahnke & Macci`o 2011; Hirschmann et al. 2010). Figure 4
suggests that such arguments should be treated with caution, as this
trend, clearly observed in Model I (upper panels), entirely reﬂects
the decrease in scatter in the velocity dispersion with increasing
stellar mass (Figure 1) which the selection bias ampliﬁes (solid
line). Graham & Scott (2013) have addressed this point differently,
by arguing that the low-mass end of the Mbh-Mbulge diagram does
not converge to a relation with a slope of unity, as required in the
many-merger scenario.

4.4 Selection-biased black hole demographics

The selection effect has another important consequence. If one uses
the observed σ-Mstar (or bulge mass) relation to translate between
σ and Mstar, then the observed Mbh-σ relation predicts a factor of
∼ 3 lower black hole masses than the observed Mbh-Mstar rela-
tion (Tundo et al. 2007; Bernardi et al. 2007; Graham et al. 2007).
Accounting for the scatter around these relations does not resolve
the discrepancy (Tundo et al. 2007). The selection-biased relations
(black lines in Figure 1) in our Monte Carlo simulations result in a
similar discrepancy. For example, in Model I, log(Mstar/M⊙) =
11 would predict a black hole mass of log(Mbh/M⊙) ∼ 8.4 (up-
per right). Figure 1 (right panels) shows that log(Mstar/M⊙) = 11
corresponds to log(σHL/km s−1) ∼ 2.25, for which the solid line
in the upper left panel of Figure 3 suggests log(Mbh/M⊙) ∼ 7.9.

10

Figure 6. Same as Figure 5, but with grey bands now showing our (selection biased) Model II. The dependence on σ (left hand panels) is weaker than in the
data.

This discrepancy is somewhat smaller, but still present, in the other
two models. Accounting for the scatter around these selection-
biased relations does not resolve the discrepancy. These are selec-
tion effects: in all models the discrepancy is much smaller if one
uses the intrinsic relations (long-dashed red curves), and it disap-
pears entirely (by deﬁnition) if one accounts for the intrinsic scatter.
In this context, the results from the cosmological black hole
model presented by Sijacki et al. (2015) and developed in the
framework of the Illustris simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014) are
informative. When normalized to the (biased) black hole mass-
bulge stellar mass relation, their model systematically overpro-
duces the Mbh-σ relation by a factor of & 3 at log(σ/km s−1) &
2.3 (their Figure 6). Our work suggests this is a consequence of
normalizing to a relation that has been biased by selection effects,
rather than to the intrinsic relation.

4.5 Correlations between residuals

Studying correlations between the residuals from various scaling
relations is an efﬁcient way of determining if a variable is fun-
damental or not. For example, if Mbh is determined by σ alone
(e.g., if α = 0 in Model I) then residuals from correlations with
σ should be uncorrelated. In this case, residuals from the Mbh-,
Mstar-, and Re−σ relations should not correlate with one another
(e.g., Bernardi et al. 2005; Sheth & Bernardi 2012). In contrast, not
only should residuals from the Mbh-Mstar relation correlate with
residuals from the σ-Mstar relation, but the slope of this correla-
tion between residuals should be the same as that of the Mbh-σ

relation itself; this is what indicates that σ controls the Mbh-Mstar
correlation.

The grey bands in each panel of Figure 5 show residuals along
the y-axis from the scaling relations measured in the selection bi-
ased subsamples of Model I. In this Model, residuals from the true
intrinsic correlations with σ (left panels) should correlate with a
slope of β ∼ 4.5, and those as a function of stellar mass (or ef-
fective radius) with a slope of α ∼ 0.5. This is indeed what the
simulations show, though the selection bias tends to slightly ﬂatten
the slope of the Mbh-σ relation (top left panel of Figure 3) from a
slope of β = 4.5 to β ∼ 4 and also the biased α ∼ 0.3 − 0.4. This
ﬂattening would be even more pronounced for higher values of the
intrinsic β and/or scatter (see discussion of Figure 9).

The red circles (ellipticals) and green triangles (S0s) in the
same Figure 5 show a similar analysis of the residuals from scaling
relations in the observed E+S0 sample of Savorgnan et al. (2015).
The slopes in all the panels on the left are β ∼ 4. We quantify the
strength of each correlation using the Pearson correlation coefﬁ-
cient r, which we report in the top left corner of each panel. These
values show that the correlations on the right are weaker than those
on the left, indicating that σ is the more important of each pair.
This is important as it shows that the selection biased sample still
correctly indicates that σ is more fundamental.

In each panel, the grey band deﬁned by Model I is consistent
with the correlation measured in the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sam-
ple. Figure 6 shows a similar analysis of Model II; the grey bands
in the left hand panels show that the dependence on σ in this model
is weaker than in the data.

Figure 7. Left: Same as top right panel of Figure 1 but with Mbulge rather than total Mstar for the sample of Savorgnan et al. (2015). Right: Same as left
panel but for the sample of Saglia et al. (2016), for which we have used σe as σHL is not available. We also include results of the Model I Monte Carlos when
using only bulge stellar masses. Filled red circles, green triangles, and blue stars in both panels correspond, respectively, to ellipticals, S0, and the bulges of
spirals. Open red circles mark the galaxies with bars. The predicted biased relations (black, solid lines) agree well with those observed (blue, dashed lines).

Despite the small size of the dataset, we have attempted to
quantify the uncertainties on the trends shown in the previous ﬁg-
ures by using a bootstrapping technique. We randomly remove
three sources from the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sample, measure the
correlations and hence the residuals from the correlations, record
the slope and scatter for the correlations between residuals, and
repeat 100 times. For the Monte-Carlos, we instead generate 100
mock samples, each having 50 objects, for which we measure the
slope and scatter of the correlations between residuals.

The mean slopes and standard deviations over the 100 realiza-
tions are reported in Table 1. The second, third, and fourth columns
report the results of the bootstrapping on the data considering only
E-S0, all galaxies, and all bulges, respectively, while the ﬁfth/sixth,
seventh, and eight columns are the results of Model I (total and
bulge stellar masses), Model II, and Model III, respectively. This
shows that Model I-total stellar masses (column 5) provides slopes
that are well consistent with those of the E-S0 Savorgnan et al.
(2015) sample (column 2). However, the uncertainties on the slopes
are relatively large, so even Model II, which tends to predict ﬂat-
ter slopes than what observed (Figure 6), is only discrepant at the
1 − 2σ level. Model III, the residuals of which are shown in Ap-
pendix B, appears to be more than 2σ discrepant, especially in the
residuals of velocity dispersion at ﬁxed stellar mass (ﬁrst row).

A similar analysis of the residuals in the Saglia et al. (2016),
McConnell & Ma (2013), L¨asker et al. (2014), and Beiﬁori et al.
(2012) samples is included in Appendix A, with the results of
the statistical analysis reported in Table 2 (columns 3, 4, 5, and
6, respectively), compared to the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sample
(column 2) and the predictions of Model I (column 7). For all
samples in Table 2 we restrict to E-S0 with total stellar masses
and effective radii, except for the Saglia et al. (2016) dataset, for
which only bulge masses and radii are available (for this sam-
ple we also include non-barred spirals). Mean slopes and un-
certainties are again computed from 100 bootstrap iterations in
which 3 sources were removed at a time, except for the smaller
Beiﬁori et al. (2012) sample, for which we only removed a single
object at a time. These other samples show the same trends we
found in the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sample. If anything, the de-
pendence on σ is stronger, and that on Mstar or Re is weaker, so
that Model I fares better than the others.

4.6 The impact of spirals and bulge-to-total decompositions

In the previous section we noted that the residuals around the
black hole-galaxy scaling relations suggest that velocity disper-
sion is the most important property of a galaxy with regards to
the black hole at its centre. That analysis was based on a sample
of early-type galaxies. In this section we include the spirals from
the Savorgnan et al. (2015) with “secure” black hole mass mea-
surements as reported in Kormendy & Ho (2013). As for the early-
types, velocity dispersions for these galaxies are taken from the Hy-
perleda data base and total half-light radii are derived as explained
in Section 2.

In the context of including spirals, however, it is possible that
the bulge mass is more relevant than the total. We noted in Section 2
that Mbulge is signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to estimate reliably (e.g.
Meert et al. 2013). Nevertheless, Meert et al. (2015) provide B/T
decompositions for their S´ersic-Exponential reductions, which we
have used to estimate Mbulge in the SDSS. Savorgnan et al. (2015)
also considered detailed galaxy decompositions that take into ac-
count spheroid, discs, spiral arms, bars, rings, halo, extended or un-
resolved nuclear source and partially depleted core, and checked for
consistency with galaxy kinematics (e.g., Arnold et al. 2014). So,
we have used bulge stellar masses to see how the offset in the top
right panel of Figure 1 changes when we replace Mstar → Mbulge.
We continue to restrict the analysis to E-S0 SDSS galaxies, as de-
termining the central velocity dispersion of spirals from the SDSS
spectra (which are not spatially resolved) is not possible. Adopting
the E-S0 bulge sample as representative of the full galaxy popu-
lation between 1010 < Mstar/M⊙ < 1012 is a safe assumption
given that the bulges of spirals have structural properties that fol-
low the scaling relations of the bulges of early-type galaxies quite
well (e.g., Bernardi et al. 2014).

The left panel of Figure 7 shows the Savorgnan et al. (2015)
data with spirals included (blue stars), but using Mbulge rather than
total masses. It shows that there is a clear offset from the σ-Mbulge
relation of the SDSS, qualitatively like that seen in Figure 1. The
signiﬁcantly larger error bars reﬂect the larger uncertainties in es-
timating Mbulge. Later-type galaxies show the largest offsets, in
agreement with Graham (2008). Also note that the Meert et al.
(2015) reductions have a slight systematic tendency to set B/T ≈
0.9 even when B/T = 1 (see Figure 9 of Meert et al. 2013). There-
fore, at large Mbulge where we expect to have B/T → 1, the SDSS

relation is shifted slightly more to the left than it should be. Re-
moving this systematic would slightly increase the offset between
the SDSS and the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sample.

The right panel of Figure 7 compares the SDSS σ-Mbulge re-
lation with the bulge masses and velocity dispersions in the sample
of Saglia et al. (2016). The offset between the two data sets here
is slightly more pronounced than it was for the Savorgnan et al.
(2015) data (on the left). Note that the mass-to-light M/L ra-
tios adopted by Saglia et al. (2016) are dynamical ones: they are
not derived from spectral analysis. Saglia et al. (2016) argue that
their M/L are broadly consistent with those obtained assum-
ing a Kroupa (Kroupa 2001) IMF which, if anything, should
yield systematically larger stellar masses at ﬁxed velocity disper-
sion than those obtained from a Chabrier IMF as in SDSS (e.g.,
Bernardi et al. 2010). We also include in Figure 7 the results of our
Monte Carlo simulations with Model I in which we replace Mstar
with Mbulge. It can be seen that the predicted, biased σ-Mbulge
relation from Model I (solid black lines) reproduces the measured
slopes and normalizations in both samples (dashed blue lines).

In both panels of Figure 7, red circles identify disc galaxies
with a bar. These tend to have similar σ to barless galaxies of the
same Mbulge. Thus, as we noted when discussing Figure 2, the se-
lection bias does not seem to be affected strongly by the presence
of a bar.

In view of the similarities between Figure 1 and Figure 2, it
should not be to surprising that the corresponding Mbh-σ and Mbh-
Mbulge relations are also biased by the selection effect. Therefore,
rather than showing this explicitly, we consider the correlations be-
tween residuals from these scaling relations deﬁned using bulge
luminosities and effective radii. Figure 8 – the analogue of Figure 5
– shows results for the Savorgnan et al. (2015) sample. It is clear
that spirals (blue stars) follow similar relations to those deﬁned by
earlier-type galaxies (red circles and green triangles). The slopes,
reported in Table 1 (column 4), match those from the E-S0 sample
well (column 2), though the dependence on σ is stronger and that

on Mbulge weaker. For completeness, column3, labeled “All”, re-
ports the results of using the total Mstar rather than Mbulge even
for spirals. The grey bands in the various panels show (selection
biased) Model I when bulge stellar masses and effective radii are
used (slopes reported in column 6 of Table 1); these are in good
agreement with the data.

In summary: Bulges of spirals follow similar relations to those
deﬁned by earlier-type galaxies (red circles and green triangles).
They too show a stronger dependence on velocity dispersion (left
panels) than other properties (right). Moreover, the addition of spi-
rals increases the baseline over which the relations on the left can be
measured; this tightens the correlations with σ and weakens those
with the other properties. This justiﬁes our earlier claim that our
results are not much affected by the use of stellar or bulge mass,
and also further supports the scenario in which spirals, or better
their bulges, are correlated with their central black holes via a steep
Mbh-σ relation, similarly to early-type galaxies. Evidently, σ is
much more important than either total or bulge luminosity and/or
size.

4.7 Dependence on strength of correlation with σ

Comparison of our selection-biased Monte Carlo simulations with
the observations suggests that σ plays an important, if not funda-
mental, role in determining Mbh. However, we have not yet ex-
plored the range of acceptable values of the free parameters in our
Model I. Figure 9 shows the result of setting Mbh ∝ M 0.5
bulgeσβ
and producing Monte Carlo simulations for a range of values of the
slope β, and rms scatter δ (blue short dashed, cyan long dashed, and
red dot-dashed as labelled). As mentioned in Section 4.1, a larger
δ results in a larger selection bias, so a lower input normalization
is required to reproduce the same set of observational data. There-
fore, we reduce γ when δ is large (black, dotted lines in the upper,
right panel). In the speciﬁc, when δ = 0.25 dex we set γ = 7.7,
as in Equation 4, while γ = 8.0 and γ = 6.6 for δ = 0.1, 0.5

blue stars refer to the bulges of ellipticals, S0s, and spirals, respectively. The grey bands show the predictions from our (selection biased) Model I with bulge
stellar masses and effective radii. Spirals continue to show residuals similar to those of early-type galaxies, with the residuals in velocity dispersion still being
much stronger than with other galactic properties, in agreement with Model I.

dex, respectively. Also, because of how our simulations are set-up,
our δ includes a potential contribution from measurement errors on
the value of Mbh. So, while they may not be the truly intrinsic val-
ues, comparing them with data, to which measurement error has
contributed, is meaningful.

The top panels show how the slope and zero-point of the
selection-biased Mbh-σ relation we measure in our Monte Carlo
simulations depends on the intrinsic slope and scatter; the middle
panels show a similar study of the selection biased Mbh-Mbulge
relation; the bottom panels compare with the selection-biased σ-
Mbulge relation (left panel of Figure 7). Dotted lines in the top two
panels show the input values; these show that the bias increases –
slope decreases and zero-point increases – as the rms scatter in-
creases. In all cases, the dashed, blue lines and grey bands show
the range of slopes and zero-points which the bulge sample of
Savorgnan et al. (2015) allow. Requiring the models to match these
bands in all six panels shows that the intrinsic relation should have
γ ∼ 7.7, β ∼ 5 and total scatter δ ∼ 0.25 dex. While models
with small values of the input (total) scatter, e.g. δ = 0.1, may
also be acceptable, they tend to be less realistic in view of the non-
negligible observational uncertainties in the dynamical Mbh esti-
mates (e.g., Ferrarese & Ford 2005). Allowing for 0.2 dex of Mbh
measurement uncertainties, an observed scatter of δ ∼ 0.25 dex,
allows for intrinsic scatter of ∼ 0.15 dex.

Section 5 discusses the implications of the values γ ∼ 7.7,

of black holes and their host galaxies.

4.8 Calibration of other Mbh proxies

Without signiﬁcant improvements in technology, it is difﬁcult to
measure dynamical masses at smaller Mbh locally, or at all at sig-
niﬁcant redshift. The alternative is to look for other observational
signatures of Mbh which do not require that rinﬂ be resolved. Ac-
tive galaxies are interesting in this respect since they can be ob-
served both locally and at greater distances, so the same observa-
tional proxy for Mbh can be used over a wide range of redshift.
The key step in this process is to calibrate these proxies using the
dynamical mass estimates we have been discussing so far.

Recently Reines & Volonteri (2015) have compiled a sample
of 262 broad-line AGN at z < 0.055 which roughly overlaps
in volume with the dynamical mass black hole samples we have
been discussing so far. Their “virial” Mbh estimates depend on
a constant of proportionality fvir ≈ 4.3, whose value was cali-
brated by matching to a Mbh-σ relation which is like that of the
selection biased sample of Savorgnan et al. (2015). With this cal-
ibration, they ﬁnd that their AGN sample has log(Mbh/M⊙) =
7.45 + 1.05 log(Mstar/1011M⊙). These Mbh values are sub-
stantially smaller than those for which dynamical Mbh measure-
ments are available; the local (typically inactive) early-types have
log Mbh = 8.9 + 1.23 log(Mstar/1011M⊙). Is physics responsi-

Upper, middle, and lower panels show results for the selection-biased Mbh − σ, Mbh − Mstar, and σ − Mstar relations. Short-dashed, long-dashed and
dot-dashed lines in each panel are for different values for the intrinsic scatter, as labelled. The dotted black lines in the right upper panel mark the three
different normalizations chosen for each different value of the scatter; the lower normalizations correspond to higher values of δ. The dotted black line in the

ble for this factor of ∼ 50 discrepancy, or are selection effects also
playing a role here?

Regarding selection effects in this context, Graham et al.
(2011) have argued that fvir ≈ 2.8 may be a more appropriate
choice. Our own analysis suggests that, because of selection ef-
fects, the Mbh values in the AGN sample should be reduced by a
much larger factor, & 3, making fvir ≈ 1. In either case, reduc-
ing fvir would exacerbate rather than reduce the apparent differ-

ence with the local Mbh-Mstar relation. However, this is not the
full story. Recall that the selection bias is much more dramatic for
Mbh-Mstar than for Mbh-σ (top panels of Figure 3). So, it is pos-
sible that the AGN samples are probing lower masses where the
Mbh-Mstar bias is particularly severe.

To illustrate, the blue squares in Figure 10 show the data of
Reines & Volonteri (2015), with their Mbh values lowered by the
(factor of three on average) difference between the intrinsic and se-

2015). Whereas Mstar≈Mbulge for the early-types with dynami-
cal Mbh measurements, Mbulge<Mstar for the AGN sample. This
would shift the blue squares to smaller Mstar (i.e. to the left in
Figure 10), further improving the match with the red circles (the
unbiased Model I relation). This agreement means that essentially
all the offset between these AGN data and current local dynamical
mass black hole samples is a selection effect, and that fvir ≈ 1.

More recently, L¨asker et al. (2016) analyzed nine megamaser
disc galaxies with an average stellar mass of Mstar ∼ 1011 M⊙ and
an average black hole mass of Mbh ∼ 107 M⊙. They report an off-
set of δ log Mbh/M⊙ = −0.8±0.2 with respect to the L¨asker et al.
(2014) best-ﬁt Mbh-Mstar relation for inactive galaxies, which is
consistent with the mean difference between our observed and in-
trinsic relations in Model I (Figure 3). Similarly, Ho & Kim (2014,
see also Ho & Kim 2016), compared reverberation-mapped AGNs
with measured bulge stellar velocity dispersions against the Mbh-
σ relation of inactive galaxies, ﬁnding a mean offset lower by
δ log Mbh/M⊙ = −0.79 dex (see their Figure 2). The discus-
sion above shows why we believe the discrepancy between the
normalizations of the black hole scaling relations of active and
dynamically-based samples is in large part a selection effect in the
latter.

4.9 On why we support the intrinsic black hole-galaxy

scaling relation as a ridge

We complete this section by discussing the possibility put forward
by Batcheldor (2010) that the intrinsic black hole-galaxy scaling
relation is not a relatively narrow ridge, but that the observed rela-
tion represents the upper limit of a much broader, almost uniform,
distribution of log Mbh at ﬁxed σ. Ford et al. (1998) had already
argued that the lack of objects with small Mbh and large σ means
this is unlikely to be correct. G¨ultekin et al. (2011) added that if it
were correct, there should be many more upper limits (i.e., non-
detections, because rinﬂ ≪ 0.1′′ for most objects) in the literature
than detections – but this is not observed.

To address this directly, we performed the same set of simu-
lations as for Model I – varying the input slope, normalization and
scatter of the “upper envelope” Model I relation (Equation 4) – and
obtained results qualitatively similar to those reported in Figure 9.
However, we believe that the relevant question is: Does the intrinsic
distribution of Mbh extend to much smaller values than our Monte
Carlo simulations have assumed?

Since even local dynamical Mbh samples cannot probe small
Mbh, we again turn to the AGN sample of Reines & Volonteri
(2015). As Figure 10 shows, this sample clearly has many small
Mbh at small Mstar but not at large Mstar. (A rather tight correla-
tion between low-mass active black holes and their hosts’ spheroid
stellar masses was also recently inferred by Graham & Scott 2015
by combining a number of independent data sets collected from the
literature.) The blue squares in Figure 11 show this sample again.
The red circles show the expected distribution if Batcheldor (2010)
were correct; we assumed the intrinsic distribution was uniform in
log Mbh from an upper envelope deﬁned by the observed Mbh-σ
relation down to 103 M⊙, though our conclusions do not depend on
the exact value. This shows clearly that the upper envelope model
is not consistent with the local AGN sample. Had we not shifted
the AGN samples downwards by a factor of four, the discrepancy
with the red symbols would have been even more dramatic.

We have also carried out additional

tests to probe the
impact of ﬂux limit effects on the observed distributions of
Reines & Volonteri (2015). We assigned broad, Schechter-type Ed-

sample of Reines & Volonteri (2015) (blue squares), shifted downwards by
a factor of ∼ 3 as described in the text (i.e., fvir ≈ 1); the intrinsic relation
for our Model I (red circles); and the corresponding selection biased relation
in Model I (dashed blue line).

Dot-dashed and long-dashed lines show the smallest observable Mbh if the
AGN is shining with the bolometric luminosity as labelled; the lower (long

whose data are shown by the blue squares. The red circles which lie above
this line show that, if the upper-limit model were correct, then many low
mass black holes should have been detected. Since there are no blue squares
at these low masses, the data rule out this model.

lection biased Monte Carlo samples in Model I (top left panel of
Figure 3). The blue dashed line – which lies substantially above
the AGN sample – shows the selection biased Mbh-Mstar relation
from the top right panel of Figure 3. The corresponding intrinsic
Mbh-Mstar relation is shown by the red circles. The agreement
between this intrinsic relation and the AGN sample is striking, par-
ticularly at log(Mstar/M⊙) ∼ 10.5, where the bulk of the AGN
data lie.

Some of the remaining difference is a consequence of report-
ing results in terms of Mstar rather than Mbulge, as it is likely that
the relevant comparison is with Mbulge (see, e.g., Graham & Scott

dington ratio distributions to our mock black holes in line with
empirical estimates (e.g., Shankar et al. 2013b; Schulze et al. 2015,
and references therein). Long-dashed and dot-dashed lines in Fig-
ure 11 show the limiting active black hole mass that is still de-
tectable above a bolometric luminosity of Lbol = 1041.5 erg s−1
and Lbol = 1043 erg s−1. It is clear that whatever the chosen in-
put duty cycle of active black holes, at the minimum luminosity of
Lbol = 1041.5 erg s−1 probed by Reines & Volonteri (2015), the
detectable limit extends between one and two orders of magnitude
below the data. We conclude that a very broad distribution of local
black holes down to very low masses, even at large σ or Mstar, is
not favoured by current data on local active galaxies (see further
discussion in Section 5).

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Direct implications of the bias in the observed scaling

relations between black holes and galaxies

We have conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings that all local galaxies with dy-
namical black hole mass estimates are a biased subset of all galax-
ies and this indicates that black hole scaling relations currently in
the literature are biased (Bernardi et al. 2007). Comparison of the
selection-biased scaling relations in our Monte-Carlo simulations
with observations, along with analysis of the residuals, strongly
suggest that the Mbh-σ relation is fundamental, with a possible
additional, relatively weak dependence on stellar (bulge) mass. In
particular, our analysis suggests that the observed Mbh-Mstar re-
lation, and as a consequence correlations with any other photomet-
ric property such as S´ersic index (e.g., Graham & Driver 2007a),
are all highly biased. The intrinsic correlation between black hole
mass and host galaxy stellar mass (total or bulge) is, according to
our study, mostly a consequence of the Mbh-σ relation. Includ-
ing (the bulges of) spirals in our reference sample of ellipticals
and lenticulars (that of Savorgnan et al. 2015) conﬁrms and ex-
tends our results. In this context it is no longer meaningful, at least
within the biased samples, to look for outliers in the observed Mbh-
Mstar relation, such as “pseudo-bulges” (e.g., Kormendy et al.
2011), or examine whether bulge or total luminosity is a bet-
ter predictor of Mbh (e.g., Marconi & Hunt 2003; H¨aring & Rix
2004; Kormendy & Bender 2011; L¨asker et al. 2014), or consider
the connection to nuclear star clusters only in terms of stellar mass
(e.g., Antonini et al. 2015; Georgiev et al. 2016).

Our Monte Carlo results constrain the normalization of the
intrinsic black hole-galaxy scaling relations to be a factor of & 3
lower than current estimates, in terms of velocity dispersion, and up
to a factor of ∼ 50 − 100 lower when expressing black hole masses
as a function of stellar mass (e.g., Figure 3). These results can rec-
oncile the apparent mass discrepancies between local dynamical
mass samples and local active galaxies (e.g., our Figure 10), in
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 active galaxies (e.g., Orban de Xivry et al.
2011; Sani et al. 2011; Mathur et al. 2012; Shankar et al. 2012a;
Calderone et al. 2013, and references therein), moderately lu-
minous AGN (e.g., Ho & Kim 2014; Reines & Volonteri 2015;
Ho & Kim 2016; L¨asker et al. 2016), active low surface brightness
galaxies (Subramanian et al. 2016), and possibly also in more dis-
tant samples (Sanghvi et al. 2014; Falomo et al. 2014; Busch et al.
2015).

The lowered normalization of the intrinsic Mbh-σ relation
will serve as a more secure base for calibrating virial estimators
of black hole mass for reverberation mapping-based scaling rela-
tions (e.g., Onken et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2010; Graham et al. 2011;

Park et al. 2012a; Grier et al. 2013; Ho & Kim 2015). The exact
value of fvir, which depends on the structure, dynamics, and line-
of-sight orientation of the broad line region, is indeed still a matter
of intense debate (see, e.g., Yong et al. 2016, for a recent discus-
sion). Typical values in the literature vary between average values
of fvir ∼ 1 and fvir ∼ 4, depending, respectively, on whether
the emission-line proﬁle which enters the virial equation is mea-
sured via its full-width at half maximum or its line dispersion (e.g.,
Collin et al. 2006; Park et al. 2012b; Ho & Kim 2014). Our anal-
ysis tends to favour lower values of fvir, i.e. fvir ≈ 1 rather
than 4. A smaller fvir by itself has a number of interesting con-
sequences. For example, it may ease the challenge of growing
very massive black holes in the early Universe (e.g., Mortlock et al.
2011; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2015), alleviates the need
to invoke very massive seeds (e.g., Alexander & Natarajan 2014;
Madau et al. 2014; Lupi et al. 2015), and it may also add some em-
pirical evidence towards the existence of intermediate-mass black
holes (e.g., Farrell et al. 2014).

Having lower mass black holes may imply a propor-
tionally lower integrated local black hole mass density (e.g.
Tundo et al. 2007; Bernardi et al. 2007; Graham & Driver 2007b;
Yu & Lu 2008; Shankar et al. 2009b, 2013a), rather than a fac-
tor of a few higher as current estimates based on the (selec-
tion biased) Mbh-Mstar relation suggest. The most recent ac-
cretion models (Shankar et al. 2013b; Aversa et al. 2015), based
on Soltan-type (Soltan 1982) arguments and continuity equa-
tion models (e.g., Cavaliere et al. 1971; Small & Blandford 1992;
Marconi et al. 2004; Yu & Lu 2004), suggest moderate average ra-
diative efﬁciencies on the order of ǫ . 0.1. Further increasing
the local mass density by a factor of a few, as suggested by the
current estimates of the local Mbh-Mbulge relation, would imply
a radiative efﬁciency proportionally lower (Novak 2013), forcing
the accretion models towards somewhat extreme scenarios such as
frequent radiatively inefﬁcient accretion and/or large fractions of
heavily obscured, Compton-thick active galaxies (Comastri et al.
2015). In contrast, a high radiative efﬁciency would imply that
most of the local black holes are spinning rapidly, suggesting that
spin may not be the only parameter controlling radio loudness
in AGN, in line with many other, independent lines of evidence
(e.g., Sikora et al. 2007; Shankar et al. 2008, 2010b, 2016, and ref-
erences therein).

Finally, lowering the normalization for the intrinsic black hole
scaling relations impacts the expected signal in gravitational wave
searches (e.g., Sesana et al. 2014, and references therein). A fac-
tor of few reduction in the normalisation reduces the characteristic
strain amplitude arising from an incoherent ensemble of gravita-
tional waves, and hence the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the
gravitational wave background currently being searched for using
pulsar timing arrays (e.g., Sesana 2013; Rosado et al. 2015). While
this reduction alleviates much of the tension between previous pre-
dictions and the lack of a detected signal (e.g., Shannon et al. 2015;
Taylor et al. 2015), it also suggests that the detection of gravita-
tional radiation via radio telescopes will be more difﬁcult than pre-
viously thought.

5.2 Implications for the co-evolution of black holes and

galaxies

In standard models, massive, bulged galaxies, the usual hosts of
supermassive black holes, are formed in a highly star-forming,
gas-rich phase at early cosmological epochs. A central, “seed”
black hole is expected to gradually grow via gas accretion, even-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1– 22

tually becoming massive enough to shine as a quasar and trig-
ger powerful winds and/or jets that are capable of removing gas
and quenching or inhibiting star formation in the host galaxy
(“quasar-mode” and “radio-mode” feedbacks). Feedback from an
active black hole has indeed become a key ingredient in many
galaxy evolution models (e.g., Granato et al. 2004; Bower et al.
2006; Croton et al. 2006; Monaco et al. 2007; Sijacki et al. 2015).
At later times, both the host galaxy and its black hole may fur-
ther increase their mass (and size) via a sequence of mergers
with other galaxies/black holes. Late mergers can contribute up to
∼80% of the ﬁnal mass (e.g., De Lucia et al. 2006; Malbon et al.
2007; Marulli et al. 2008; Naab et al. 2009; Shankar & Bernardi
2009; Oser et al. 2010; Shankar et al. 2010a; Gonz´alez et al. 2011;
Shankar et al. 2013a, 2014, 2015; Zhang et al. 2015; Zhao et al.
2015). The apparent tightness of the Mbh-Mstar relation is some-
times used to motivate black hole mass growth by dry mergers
(e.g., Peng 2007; Jahnke & Macci`o 2011). Such arguments must
be reconsidered if this tightness is just a selection effect (Figure 4).
Whether merger models can explain the tightness of the Mbh-σ
relation remains to be seen.

Moreover, our results suggest that (the bulges of) spirals,
which are usually not considered to have undergone a sub-
stantial phase of late dry mergers (e.g., Huertas-Company et al.
2013; Patel et al. 2013; Huertas-Company et al. 2015), deﬁne
similar correlations as do ellipticals,
further pointing
to the Mbh-σ relation as
the dominant correlation. This
weakens the motivation for models in which Mbh in spi-
rals grows
substantially via any secular process unrelated
to σ (e.g., Bower et al. 2006; Hopkins & Hernquist 2009;
Bournaud et al. 2011; Draper & Ballantyne 2012; Shankar et al.
2012b; Fontanot et al. 2015; Gatti et al. 2016).

thus

The importance of σ inferred from our analysis supports mod-
els in which AGN, and in particular quasar-mode feedback, play
a key role in linking black holes to their host galaxies. Our re-
sults suggest that the scaling with σ is strong, Mbh ∝ σ5 (Fig-
ure 9), typical of energy-driven winds (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998;
Granato et al. 2004; Hopkins et al. 2006, but see also Cen 2015).
In contrast, momentum-driven winds produce a somewhat weaker
trend: Mbh ∝ σ4, though the exact normalization and slopes pre-
dicted by AGN-feedback models as a function of time, mass, and
host morphology is still a matter of intense debate (e.g., Fabian
1999; King 2003; Fabian 2012; Faucher-Gigu`ere & Quataert 2012;
Gabor & Bournaud 2014; King 2014).

Evolution in scaling relations is a powerful constraint on mod-
els (e.g., Merloni et al. 2010). However, our results suggest that
searches for evolution in terms of Mstar are less well-motivated
(because the observed Mbh-Mbulge relation is more biased and less
fundamental). On the other hand, most analyses based on Soltan-
type arguments or direct detections suggest that the Mbh-σ re-
lation evolves weakly if at all (e.g., Gaskell & Kormendy 2009;
Shankar et al. 2009a; Zhang et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2015, but see
also Woo et al. 2008). This further paves the way towards using
black holes and quasars as cosmological distance estimators (e.g.,
H¨onig et al. 2014).

Our results shed some light on the long-standing issue regard-
ing the most accurate local black hole mass estimator in favour
of the Mbh-σ relation (with similar slope but lower normaliza-
tion, and a possible additional weak dependence on stellar mass).
However, this raises a puzzle. Lauer et al. (2007a) argued that the
Mbh-Lbulge relation is a more reliable black hole mass estimator
for the most massive/luminous galaxies hosting the most massive
black holes, such as those in the brightest cluster galaxies (see also,

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1– 22

SMBHs: selection bias and its consequences

17

e.g., Laporte & White 2015). They argued that black hole mass es-
timates via the Mbh-σ relation are too low to account for the ex-
istence of cores in these galaxies, believed to be produced by the
ejection of stars during the decay of black hole binaries. In this
respect their conclusions are at odds with our argument that the
Mbh-σ relation is more fundamental than Mbh-Mstar. However,
our Figure 3 shows that if σ is the driving parameter, then the Mbh-
Mbulge relation is at least as biased as the Mbh-σ relation, so one
should worry about how selection effects affect their argument. In
addition, it is possible that other processes such as dynamical fric-
tion and AGN feedback effects may contribute to the creation of
cores in the inner regions of massive galaxies (e.g., El-Zant et al.
2004; Tonini et al. 2006; Martizzi et al. 2013; El-Zant et al. 2016).
A number of observations and black hole accretion mod-
els
(e.g., Marconi et al. 2004; Merloni 2004; Granato et al.
2006; Lapi et al. 2006; Zheng et al. 2009; Silverman et al. 2008;
Shankar et al. 2009b; Mullaney et al. 2012; Lapi et al. 2014) sug-
gest some degree of correlation between black hole growth and
large-scale star formation. On the other hand, a number of obser-
vational and theoretical studies are now showing that the actual co-
evolution may be more complex to probe observationally, possibly
depending on the different evolutionary phases undergone by the
host galaxies as well as AGN variability effects (e.g., Hickox et al.
2014; Rodighiero et al. 2015; Volonteri et al. 2015; Graham 2016;
Westhues et al. 2016, and references therein). Indeed the large scat-
ter measured in the correlation between star formation and X-ray
AGN luminosity (Dai et al. 2015, and references therein) might
simply reﬂect the large scatter in the intrinsic Mbh-Mstar relation
(Figure 4), a possible independent sign for velocity dispersion, in-
stead of stellar mass, acting as the main driver of the co-evolution
between central black holes and their hosts.

How and why galaxies transition from a very active, star-
forming phase to a red-and-dead one is still hotly debated. There
are a number of hypotheses (not necessarily mutual exclusive) put
forward in the literature to explain the quenching of star forma-
tion in galaxies (e.g., Woo et al. 2013). Our results on the impor-
tance of the Mbh-σ relation suggests that the action of black hole
feedback triggered during a quasar-like phase may be a substan-
tial contributor to quenching. In this respect, mounting evidence
for a nearly environment-independent ﬂattening in the star forma-
tion rate-stellar mass relation at high Mstar (e.g., Erfanianfar et al.
2016, and references therein), paralleling an increased incidence of
bulge-dominated galaxies, is also suggestive. The increase in host
velocity dispersion may in fact be correlated with the growth of a
central black hole; the associated feedback can reduce star forma-
tion, though alternative explanations in terms of, e.g., morphologi-
cal transformations, may still be viable solutions (e.g., Martig et al.
2009; Huertas-Company et al. 2015).

6 CONCLUSIONS

The main aim of this work was to revisit the local scaling relations
between black holes and their host galaxies. Our main results can
be summarized as follows:

• We have conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings that

local galaxies
with dynamical black hole mass estimates are a biased subset
of all galaxies (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002; Bernardi et al. 2007;
van den Bosch et al. 2015). At ﬁxed stellar mass, local black hole
hosts typically have velocity dispersions that are larger than the
bulk of the population, irrespective of their exact morphological

18

type or of the aperture within which the velocity dispersion aper-
ture is measured (Figure 1). One of the main reasons for this bias is
the observationally imposed requirement that the black hole sphere
of inﬂuence (equation 2) must be resolved for the black hole mass
to be reliably estimated.

• We have conﬁrmed the assertion in Bernardi et al. (2007) that
the selection bias cannot be ignored: black hole scaling relations
currently in the literature are biased. To properly interpret the mea-
sured Mbh-scaling relations, one must quantify the effects of this
bias. We did so by carrying out Monte Carlo simulations in which
we assumed different scaling relations to assign black holes to
mock galaxies (equations 4–5), and then applied the rinﬂ-related
selection cuts. These show that the intrinsic relation

log(cid:18) Mbh

M⊙ (cid:19) = γ + β log(cid:16)

σ

200 km s−1(cid:17) + α log(cid:18) Mstar

1011 M⊙(cid:19)

with γ = 7.7, β ∼ 4.5 − 5, α . 0.5, and intrinsic scatter of
the order of 0.25 dex reproduces all the observed scaling relations
(Figures 3, 5 and 9), as well as the biased relation between veloc-
ity dispersion and stellar mass observed in local black hole hosts
(Figure 2). Equations (6) and (7) give the Mbh-Mstar and Mbh-σ
relations which result from this Mbh-σ-Mstar relation.

• The observed Mbh-Mstar relation is much more biased than
Mbh-σ (Figure 3). The apparent tightness of the Mbh-Mstar re-
lation is a selection effect, as are trends of the scatter with mass
(Figure 4).

• A more detailed comparison of the scaling relations in our
selection-biased Monte Carlo samples with similar relations in real
data suggest that the correlation with velocity dispersion is the
dominant one: any additional dependence on stellar mass and ef-
fective radius must be small (Figures 5, 6 and A2–B1).

• Spirals tend to deﬁne similar correlations to ellipticals and
lenticulars. All our results remain valid if we replace Mstar with
Mbulge (Section 4.5; Figures 7, 8 and A1).

Our ﬁndings have a number of implications:
(1) Our preference for steeper slopes in the intrinsic Mbh-σ re-
lation (β & 5), is consistent with that of energy-driven AGN
feedback models. Our normalization, log(Mbh/M⊙) = 7.8 at
σ = 200 km s−1 (Equation 7), is a factor & 3× lower than previ-
ous estimates. This suggests proportionally lower black hole mass
densities, and so higher radiative efﬁciencies, supporting a scenario
in which most super-massive black holes are rapidly spinning. Re-
ducing Mbh values by a factor & 3 also reduces the predicted grav-
itational wave signal from black hole mergers, perhaps explaining
why pulsar timing arrays have not yet reported detections.
(2) Our revised intrinsic black hole scaling relations will serve as
a more secure base for calibrating virial estimators of black hole
mass for reverberation mapping-based scaling relations. Our results
suggest that the calibration factor should be reduced from fvir ≈ 1.
(3) The fact that the Mbh-Mstar relation is so much more biased
than Mbh-σ (top panels of Figure 3) explains most of the offset
between local (inactive) Mbh samples having dynamical mass es-
timates, and AGN-based samples (Figure 10).
(4) Our simulations also disfavour broad distributions of black hole
masses at ﬁxed velocity dispersion (Figure 11).
(5) Unless one has accounted for selection effects, looking for out-
liers (e.g. bars, pseudo-bulges) from the Mbh-Mstar relation is no
longer so meaningful. Similarly, searches for redshift evolution in
the Mbh-Mstar relation, which do not account for selection effects,
are not well-motivated. Since the apparent tightness and mass de-
pendence of the Mbh-Mstar relation are biased by the selection
effect, any heavily (dry) merger-driven black hole growth model

must be reconsidered.
(6) The similarity of spirals to ellipticals means that the motiva-
tion for models which trigger black holes via disc instabilities or
processes other than quasar feedback that do not directly involve
velocity dispersion should be re-evaluated.
(7) As σ is the controlling parameter in a number of other galaxy
scaling relations (Bernardi et al. 2005), our ﬁnding that σ is the
most important parameter in Mbh scaling relations will serve as
a more robust test for the next generation of galaxy-black hole
co-evolution models, for a deeper understanding of high-redshift
data on active and star-forming galaxies, and for more accurate es-
timates of the black hole mass function.

SMBHs: selection bias and its consequences

APPENDIX A: RESIDUALS IN OTHER DATA SETS

Figures A1, A2, A3, and A4 show correlations between the residu-
als from scaling relations measured in the samples of Saglia et al. (2016),
McConnell & Ma (2013), L¨asker et al. (2014), and Beiﬁori et al. (2012)
(the latter with black hole masses taken from Kormendy & Ho (2013)). Fig-
ure A1 shows the residuals using bulge luminosities and effective radii in
the Saglia et al. (2016) sample, excluding non-barred spirals, while all other
samples refer to total stellar masses and effective radii of E+S0s (bulge
properties are not available for most of these samples). The grey bands show
the corresponding correlations for Model I. In the panels on the left, all data
sets deﬁne comparable if not even tighter correlations than those shown in
Figure 5, while those on the right show weaker dependence on any other
variable, in excellent agreement with Model I.

APPENDIX B: RESIDUALS IN Model III

In Model III, the intrinsic relation is Mbh ∝ M 2

star/Re, so residuals
from correlations with velocity dispersion should be uncorrelated. The grey
band in the top left panel of Figure B1 shows this is also true in the selection
biased sample. In contrast, the Savorgnan et al. (2015) data show a strong
correlation. The data shows a steeper correlation in the bottom left panel as
well. On the other hand, in the top right panel, it is the model which shows
a stronger correlation than the data. The slopes of these correlations, with
uncertainties derived from many Monte Carlo realizations (see Section 4.5),
are reported in Table 1.

F. Shankar et al.

Figure A1. Same as Figure 8, but for bulge stellar masses and half-light radii from Saglia et al. (2016). Red circles indicate barred galaxies, while the colour
coding is otherwise the same as in Figure 8.

Figure A2. Same as Figure 5 but using the E+S0 sample from L¨asker et al. (2014). The data are consistent with velocity dispersion being the most fundamental
property connecting black holes to galaxies.

Figure A3. Same as Figure 5 but using the E+S0 sample from L¨asker et al. (2014). The data are consistent with velocity dispersion being the most fundamental
property connecting black holes to galaxies.

Figure A4. Same as Figure 5 but using the E+S0 sample from McConnell & Ma (2013) with galaxy 3.6µ galaxy luminosities and effective radii from Sani et al.
(2011). The data continue being consistent with velocity dispersion being the most fundamental property connecting black holes to galaxies.

F. Shankar et al.

Figure B1. Same as Figure 5 but for Model III. Similarly to Model II, this model also predicts weaker correlations with σ and stronger trends with other
variables than is observed.
