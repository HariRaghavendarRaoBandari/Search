Revised (March 18, 2016)

We review the impact of sterile neutrino dark matter on core-collapse supernova ex-
plosions. We summarize various oscillations between electron neutrinos or mixed µ − τ
neutrinos and right-handed sterile neutrinos that have been studied within a supernova
model. In particular, we consider sterile neutrino masses and mixing angles that are
consistent with sterile neutrino dark matter candidates as indicated by recent x-ray ﬂux
measurements. We review how mixing between electron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos
can signiﬁcantly enhance the shock energy, and even a model that does not explode can
be made to explode by this mechanism. However, the mixing between µ − τ neutrinos
and sterile neutrinos does not signiﬁcantly alter the explosion and has little eﬀect on the

1. Introduction

The nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest open questions in physics
and is vital to developing a complete picture of both cosmology and fundamental
physics. One viable dark matter candidate is a sterile neutrino.1 Sterile neutrino
dark matter is an electroweak singlet that does not participate in the strong, weak,
or electromagnetic interaction. Thus, it is consistent with limits from the Large
Electron-Positron collaboration measurement2 of the width of the Z 0 gauge boson.
The standard model does not provide any predictions about this proposed particle,
but bounds can be placed1, 3–10 on the mass and mixing angle parameter space
for sterile neutrino dark matter by x-ray astronomy, cosmology and supernovae, i.e

1 keV < ms < 18 keV and sin2 2θs (cid:46) 1.93 × 10−5(cid:0) ms

keV

(cid:1)−5.04

.

At the same time neutrinos play an intriguing and important role in both cos-
mology and the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Neutrinos dominate
the energetics of core-collapse supernovae due to the high neutrino ﬂuxes that are
emitted as the protoneutron star forms. Observations indicate that a typical explo-
sion energy of CCSNe is ∼ 1051 ergs, which is only ∼1% of the emitted neutrino
energy within the ﬁrst few seconds after bounce.

Despite recent developments in computational methods, however, a detailed un-
derstanding the explosion mechanism of CCSNe has not yet emerged. Spherically
symmetric models tend to not explode and those two-dimensional (2D) and three
dimensional (3D) models that do explode, tend to explode with too little energy.11
The problem is that, although a shock forms successfully and propagates outward in
mass, it loses energy to the photodissociation of heavy nuclei and quickly becomes
a standing accretion shock.

There have been many attempts to revitalize the stalled shock via hydrodynamic
eﬀects, such as the standing accretion shock instability12–14 and neutrino heated
convection,15–18 but even in these cases the explosion energies tend to be too low.11
Nevertheless, given the enormous neutrino ﬂuxes present, it is unavoidable that
neutrinos should play a dominant role in the explosion mechanism.

Even one dimensional spherically symmetric models will explode in simulations
with enhanced neutrino ﬂuxes, either from convection below the neutrinosphere19–21
or a QCD phase transition.22 In this paper, we will explore the resonant mixing23, 24
between a sterile and electron neutrino (or antineutrino) to increase the early neu-
trino luminosity and revitalize the shock. In Ref. 25 it was found that many masses
and mixing angles give rise to enhanced explosion energies. This review, however,
will focus speciﬁcally on masses and mixing angles that are consistent with con-
straints on sterile neutrino dark matter candidates. We also discuss other mixing

possibilities than just νe ↔ νs oscillations.

The eﬃcient transport of neutrino energy using sterile neutrinos was ﬁrst pro-
posed by Hidaka and Fuller.23, 24 Using a one zone collapse calculation, they studied
the resonant oscillations of a sterile neutrino with the mass and mixing angle of a
warm dark matter candidate. A resonant conversion νe → νs could occur deep inside
the protoneutron star core. Although this initially decreases the shock energy by
decreasing the electron fraction in the core and removing energy, they found that a
second resonance may occur near the protoneutron star surface. Thus, the resonant
mixing of sterile neutrinos and electron neutrinos can serve as an eﬃcient method
of transporting neutrino energy from the protoneutron star core, where high energy
neutrinos are trapped, to the stalled shock to assist in neutrino reheating. This
mechanism is highly sensitive to the feedback between neutrino oscillations and
the local composition, energy transport, and hydrodynamics and warrants detailed
numerical studies, which we review here.

In Ref. 25 coherent active-sterile neutrino oscillations were studied using the
University of Notre Dame-Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (UND/LLNL)
code,21, 30 a spherically symmetric relativistic supernova model with detailed neu-
trino transport and hydrodynamics. Sterile neutrinos with masses and mixing angles
consistent with dark matter constraints and their impact on shock reheating were
studied. It was found that sterile neutrino dark matter candidates can enhance the
shock energy and lead to a successful explosion.

In Ref. 25 a large region of the sterile neutrino parameter space was considered
that varied over several orders of magnitude in mass and mixing angle. It was
concluded that much of the parameter space led to eﬃcient neutrino reheating and
resulted in successful explosions. In this review we will look more speciﬁcally at the
parameter space allowed for dark matter candidates and also consider νs mixing
with νµτ .

The organization of this review is as follows. In Sec. 2 we discuss the theory and
possible observational signatures of sterile neutrino dark matter. In Sec. 3 we discuss
the active-sterile matter-enhanced resonances. In Sec. 4, show that not only is an
enhanced explosion possible, but the mass-mixing angle parameter space overlaps
with that of possible dark matter candidates. Some discussion and conclusions are
provided in Sec. 5.

2. Sterile neutrino dark matter

It seems unnatural that in the standard model there are no right handed neutri-
nos. This is after all the simplest symmetry imaginable. If neutrinos are massless,
and lepton numbers are conserved as was thought when the standard model was
ﬁrst developed, then one must avoid a right-handed neutrino. However, it is now
known that neutrinos both have mass and that they change their ﬂavors. Hence, the
introduction of right handed (sterile neutrinos) is, perhaps the most plausible and
simplest possible extension of the standard model. One simply adds to the standard

where MI is the sterile neutrino mass. Since the right handed neutrinos have no
electric, weak or strong charges they are dubbed “sterile” or “singlet”.

Introducing this Lagrangian has the possibility to solve two of the problems of
the standard model, i.e. the masses of active neutrinos and the existence of dark
matter. If the Dirac masses MD = FI(cid:104)φ(cid:105) are much smaller than the Majorana
masses MI , then the type I seesaw formula26–29 relates the active neutrino masses
mν to the sterile neutrino masses, i.e.

where (mν)αβ is a 3 × 3 matrix of active neutrino masses, mixings, and (possible)
CP-violating phases.

Also, since there is a wide range of choice for the sterile neutrino masses, they
become a viable dark matter candidate. However, detecting such sterile neutrinos
in dark matter detectors is challenging compared to that of other WIMP candidates
since its interaction with normal matter is suppressed by a factor of the weak
coupling constant times the oscillation mixing angle with normal matter. Rather,
the best chance to detect sterile neutrino dark matter is through its radiative decay
or its aﬀect on core collapse supernovae which is the subject of this review.

Radiative decays of dark matter are allowed in many models, including sterile
neutrinos. In extensions of the standard model, sterile neutrinos have several pos-
sible decay modes. The primary decay channel is to three light, active neutrinos
and is thus virtually invisible. However, several radiative decay channels are also
allowed. The most important is via two body decay to a photon and a light, active
neutrino, where Eγ = ms/2. The rate of this decay has been investigated for both
Dirac and Majorana neutrinos31 and is large enough to potentially place bounds on
the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle. The rate for a Majorana neutrino is31

where sin2 2θs is the singlet neutrino mixing angle and ms is the sterile neutrino
mass. It should be noted, however, that this decay rate is model dependent31 and
only applies for the most basic Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass models.

With the advent of modern x-ray telescopes, the detection of such decay modes
is feasible if the decay rate is large enough. Although the decay rate is small, the
dark matter halos in galaxies and galaxy clusters are large enough to generate a
potentially measurable ﬂux. Assuming that sterile neutrinos are the only component

for a sterile neutrino of mass ms and mixing angle θs, ρDM is the dark matter
column density along the line of sight, and MDM is the dark matter mass within
the telescope’s ﬁeld of view. If sterile neutrinos are only a fractional component of
the total dark matter, then an observed ﬂux may be ﬁt by a larger mixing angle,
since the ﬂux given in Eq. (4) scales with both the mass of sterile neutrinos and the
mixing angle.

Observations with the Chandra and XMM Newton satellites of x-ray emission
from various galaxies and galaxy clusters3–5, 7, 32 have attempted to put upper
bounds on the parameters of these decays. However, recent observations by Bo-
yarsky et al8 and Bulbul et al9 have detected an unidentiﬁed emission line at ∼ 3.5
keV. The mixing angle is best ﬁt as sin2 2θ ≈ 7 × 10−11. Additional bounds may
be placed on the mixing of a sterile neutrino with an electron neutrino from dark
matter over- and under-production in the νMSM8 and phase space bounds for fer-
monic dark matter.7, 33, 34 These bounds are summarized in Figure 1, alongside the
current limits from x-ray observations.

Interpretation of this anomalous x-ray emission8, 9 however remains ambiguous
due to possible observational backgrounds. Many dark matter systems, such as the
galactic center or galaxy clusters, are x-ray bright objects with contributions from
both point sources and plasma emission. Although eﬀorts have been made to model
this background using multi-temperature plasma models, constraining uncertainties
such as the temperatures and compositions in such complicated systems is diﬃcult.
It has been argued9, 35 that the observed 3.5 keV line may be due to known plasma
lines, mainly K XVIII lines at 3.48 and 3.52 keV. However, ﬁts of the 3.5 keV
emission with a potassium line35 require either super-solar abundances of potassium
or an emissivity higher than predicted with our current understanding of these
systems.

The non-detection of such an x-ray line from dwarf spheroidal galaxies raises
further questions about the nature of this emission line. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies
are extremely dark matter dominated objects and, given the observations of Bulbul
et al9 and Boyarsky et al,8 one expects to see x-ray emission from these objects
as well. However, recent simulations36 show that it may be possible to account for
the non-detection of x-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies using a multi-
component dark matter model with cold and warm components, where the warm
component is a sterile neutrino that decays via 3.5 keV photon emission and the cold
component can be any heavy WIMP or other dark matter candidate. There remains
some controversy over the formation of such objects, since ΛCDM models over pre-
dict the formation of Milky Way satellites compared to current observations37, 38

whereas WDM models wash out dark matter over-densities on these scales.39 These
multicomponent dark matter simulations accurately describe the observed num-
ber of Milky Way satellites and the non-detection of X-ray emission from dwarf
spheroidals.

3. Matter-enhanced neutrino oscillations

To solve the full neutrino mixing problem with a sterile neutrino requires an un-
derstanding of the full 4 × 4 mixing matrix, including mass diﬀerences and mixing
angles between all neutrino species. For the most part, however, studies have been
limited to oscillations between just an electron neutrino νe and sterile neutrino νs
(and their antiparticles) or just a µ − τ neutrino νµτ and sterile neutrino νs.

In vacuum, neutrino mixings between an electron neutrino and a sterile neutrino
are governed by the vacuum mixing angle sin2 2θs and mass-squared diﬀerence ∆m2
s.
However, in dense matter such as in supernovae, forward scattering oﬀ of baryons
and leptons gives rise to an eﬀective “in-medium” mixing angle as a function of

(8)

The antineutrino species experience scattering potentials with the opposite sign.
In our work, we have chosen to let Yνµ = Yντ = 0, since µ and τ neutrinos and
antineutrinos are produced entirely by pair creation processes and thus occur in
equal numbers.

Looking at Eq. 5, one can see that it is possible to get maximal mixing in matter
(sin2 2θM = 1) even when the vacuum mixing angle is small. This resonant mixing
occurs for neutrinos with the energy

Eres =

cos 2θ.

(9)

Thus, any neutrinos of species x at position r and with energy Eres will experience
a Mikehey-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance.41, 42

In this study, we have only considered coherent and adiabatic neutrino oscil-
lations. Coherent oscillations occur when the resonance width is greater than the
neutrino mean free path. The resonance occurs over a ﬁnite distance (or time) on
the neutrino’s world line,

which deﬁnes the resonance width. This corresponds to the distance over which
the in-medium mixing angle falls from a maximum to one half (sin2 2θM = 1/2).
The adiabaticity of the resonance is a measure of the eﬃciency of the conversion
of neutrino ﬂavor. The resonance can be considered adiabatic if the the resonance
width is much greater than the oscillation length,

If the oscillation is both coherent and adiabatic, all of the neutrinos of a given ﬂavor
x with ∆Eres = Eres tan 2θs of the resonance energy Eres will oscillate to sterile
neutrinos, and vice versa.

It is likely that decoherent, scattering-induced oscillations will be important
in the high matter densities achieved in the collapsing core, but this will not be
a dominant eﬀect and it is suﬃcient here to only consider coherent and adiabatic
neutrino oscillations. We leave the exploration of scattering-induced eﬀects to future
work.

In Ref. 25 UND/LLNL21 spherically-symmetric general relativistic hydrody-
namic supernova model with a 20 M(cid:12) progenitor model from Ref. 43. To study
the impact of sterile neutrino oscillations on the explosion energy a model that can
explode successfully was used as a starting place and baseline for comparison. For
further details of the UND/LLNL supernova model, we refer the reader to Refs. 21,
25.

4. Simulations

Figure 2 shows results of simulations for a wide range of masses (1 keV < ∆ms <
10 keV) and mixing angles (10−11 < sin2 2θ < 10−2) which encompasses the region
of parameter space that corresponds with dark matter candidates.
For νe ↔ νs mixing, Figure 2 shows the enhancement to the explosion energy in
a simulation with a sterile neutrino compared to the explosion energy in a simulation
without a sterile neutrino. The shaded region indicates the allowed parameter space
for dark matter candidates. The darkest region are the bounds if sterile neutrinos
contribute 100% of the observed dark matter mass, the intermediate shading is for
a 10% contribution, and the lightest region shows the bounds for a 1% contribution.
There is a large region of the parameter space that enhances the explosion energy
by at least a few percent and part of this parameter space overlaps with dark matter
candidates.
For νµτ ↔ νs mixing, we found no signiﬁcant enhancement (or depletion) to
the shock energy for the parameter space of sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle
considered here. This is likely due to the fact that the µ − τ neutrinos do not
experience eﬃcient matter-induced oscillation.
For illustration a speciﬁc choice of mass ms = 1 keV and mixing angle sin2 2θs =
10−5 for νe ↔ νs mixing is adopted to highlight the mechanisms by which the shock
reheating occurs. The speciﬁc choice of mass and mixing angle is not important,
as any choice of mass and mixing angle that causes an enhancement will behave in
roughly the same way.

4.1. νe ↔ νs Mixing
In the case of νe ↔ νs mixing, the enhancement to the explosion energy is quite
drastic for a 1 keV sterile neutrino with mixing angle sin2 2θs = 10−5. This is
evident in both the parameter plot (Fig. 2) and in more detail in Figure 3. Figure 3
shows the kinetic energy versus time post-bounce for simulations without a sterile
neutrino and with a 1 keV sterile neutrino. At 1 s post-bounce, the explosion energy
is enhanced by ∼ 2.2× with a sterile neutrino. Although the enhancement to the
kinetic energy isn’t evident until about 0.2 s post-bounce, this is in congruence with
the neutrino reheating mechanism. After the shock stalls, it takes a fraction of a
second for the neutrino reheating to become eﬀective.

The enhancement of shock reheating is due to an increase in the neutrino lu-
minosities of all three neutrino types (νe, ¯νe, and νµτ ). Figure 4 shows the neu-
trino luminosities versus time post-bounce, both with and without a sterile neu-

trino present. The neutrino luminosities of all neutrino and antineutrino ﬂavors are
enhanced from about 0.2s to 0.4s post-bounce. It is this increase in the neutrino
luminosities that increases the neutrino reheating behind the stalled shock, and thus
enhancing the explosion energy. The timescale of the increase of the neutrino lumi-
nosities corresponds to the time post-bounce when the explosion energy becomes
enhanced.

It is somewhat counterintuitive that oscillations between electron and sterile
neutrinos would result in an increase in the luminosities of all neutrino ﬂavors.
However, it is important to note that the oscillation doesn’t directly lead to increased
neutrino reheating behind the shock. Rather, a “double reheating” phenomenon
occurs, where the νe ↔ νs oscillation leads to additional heating near the location
of the neutrino sphere, this heating at the neutrino sphere causes increased neutrino
luminosities in all three ﬂavors, and ﬁnally these enhanced neutrino luminosities
reheat the stalled shock wave.

The details of this mechanism are evident in the behavior of the neutrino sphere.

with and without a sterile neutrino. It is evident that oscillations between elec-
tron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos heat the protoneutron star surface and cause
it to expand by depositing additional neutrino energy at the location of the sec-
ond resonance. This leads to an increased neutrino sphere radius. Figure 6 shows
the temperature versus radius at an illustrative time (250 ms post-bounce) for a
simulation with and without a sterile neutrino. As can be seen in Figure 6, the
protoneutron star surface is heated and extended in the simulation with a sterile
neutrino, compared to a simulation without a sterile neutrino. Although the radius
of the neutrino sphere is increased in the presence of a sterile neutrino, the temper-
ature at the neutrino sphere remains the same in both simulations. Thus, the larger
neutrinosphere leads to an enhanced emission of neutrinos, but the neutrinos are
emitted with the same average energy in both simulations.

Oscillations between an electron neutrino and sterile neutrino can lead to a sig-
niﬁcant enhancement of the explosion energy in core-collapse supernova simulations.
This enhancement is due to the expansion of the neutrino sphere and increased lu-
minosities of all three neutrino types (νe, ¯νe, and νµτ ).

5. Conclusions

X-ray observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate a possible emission line
at ∼ 3.5 keV. There are two proposed explanations of this line: atomic emission from
potassium or a decaying 7 keV sterile neutrino dark matter. The potassium lines
near 3.5 keV are diﬃcult to ﬁt in the observed environments due to the uncertainties
in the plasma temperature, backgrounds, and atomic abundances. Many ﬁts require
a potassium abundance well above solar values. This seems unlikely in the observed
environments.

The observed x-ray emission may be due to decaying sterile neutrino dark mat-
ter. If this is the case, bounds can be placed on the sterile neutrino mass and mixing
angle from the photon energy and observed ﬂux. Further observations are needed

such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

dark matter model, but further work is required to fully understand the obser-
vational signatures of such multi-component models. As far as the impact on the
CCSN explosion is concerned, a multi-component model is preferred since a larger
region of the sterile neutrino mass-mixing angle parameter spaces leads to an en-
hanced explosion if sterile neutrinos only make up a few percent of the dark matter
mass. This allows for a shorter lifetime corresponding to the larger mixing angles
needed to impact the explosion.

For oscillations between an electron neutrino and sterile neutrino, a large re-
gion of the sterile neutrino mass-mixing angle parameter space allowed by these
observations leads to an enhancement in the explosion energy of core-collapse su-
pernovae. This enhancement to the explosion energy is mainly due to the heating
and expansion of the neutrino sphere, which results in the increased luminosities of
all neutrino (and antineutrino) ﬂavors.
For νµτ ↔ νs oscillations, however, there is little eﬀect on the explosion en-
ergy. The forward scattering potential does not drop below the neutrino chemical
potential to enough of an extent to generate a meaningful number of oscillations.

This result is especially promising when one considers our current understand-
ing of 2- and 3-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations. Most multidimen-
sional models explode via a hydrodynamic instability such as SASI or neutrino
heated convection, but the explosion energies tend to be lower than that required
by observations. Based on studies to date, if a sterile neutrino were included in a
multidimensional model, its presence may be suﬃcient to enhance the explosion
energy and match observations. Clearly, further work is merited to explore this
possibility.
