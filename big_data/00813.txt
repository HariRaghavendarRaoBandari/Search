SOME REMARKS RELATED TO MAEDA’S CONJECTURE

M. RAM MURTY & K. SRINIVAS

Abstract. In this article we deal with the problem of counting the number
of pairs of normalized eigenforms (f, g) of weight k and level N such that
ap(f ) = ap(g) where ap(f ) denotes the p−th Fourier coeﬃcient of f . Here p
is a ﬁxed prime.

1. Introduction

Let Sk(N ) denote the space of cusp forms of weight k and level N on the congru-

ence subgroup Γ0(N ) of SL2(Z). Let f (z) =Pn≥1 anqn ∈ Sk(N ) be a normalized

Hecke eigenform, i.e., f is an eigenfunction for all the Hecke operators Tp’s and
Up’s and a1 = 1. The famous Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture (proved by Deligne
[2]) says that the p-th Fourier coeﬃcient of f is of the form

ap(f ) = 2p(k−1)/2 cos θp(f ),

(1.1)
for some real angle θp(f ) ∈ [0, π].
In this paper we shall discuss the following question: for a ﬁxed prime p, count the
pairs of normalized eigenforms (f, g) of weight k and level N such that ap(f ) =
ap(g).

p 6 |N

More precisely, we prove the following:

THEOREM. For a ﬁxed prime p, the number of pairs (f, g) of normalized eigen-
forms in Sk(N ) such that θp(f ) = θp(g) is bounded by

O  (dim Sk(N ))2 (log p)

(log kN )

! ,

where the implied constant is absolute and independent of p.

In other words, our result gives a small saving over the trivial bound provided

Our interest in this question is partly motivated by a famous conjecture of Maeda

log p ≪ log kN .
[3] which predicts for N = 1 that the polynomial
(X − ap(f )),

(1.2)

Yf

where the product is over all normalized Hecke eigenforms, is irreducible over the
rational number ﬁeld.
In fact, Maeda conjectures that the Galois group of this
polynomial is the full symmetric group Sd where d is the dimension of the space

Sk(1). In other words, Maeda predicts that for level 1, the number of pairs in our
theorem is exactly dim Sk(1). For a ﬁxed higher level, Tsaknias [5] has conjectured
that the above polynomial is a product of a bounded number of irreducible poly-
nomials viewed as a function of k. Though there is some computational data to
support these conjectures, they seem to be far out of reach of present knowledge
and techniques. Thus, it seems appropriate to investigate these questions through
methods currently known. This is partial motivation of our work.

In the course of our proof, a certain exponential sum arises. Based on general
heuristics about such exponential sums (more precisely the “philosophy” of square
root cancellation) we give a heuristic argument to support Maeda-Tsaknias’s pre-
diction [5] regarding the bounded number of Galois orbits. Before we proceed to
prove the theorem, we recall some preliminary results which will play an important
role in proving the theorem.

2. Approximation of characteristic functions with Selberg

polynomials

Let I = [a, b] be an interval contained in [−1/2, 1/2] and χI the characteristic
function of the interval I. From the works of Selberg, Beurling and Vaaler (see
[7]), there is a trigonometric polynomial SM of degree at most M such that the
following hold:

Let e(t) denote e2πit. If we write the Fourier series for SM (x) as

3. A preliminary estimate

From now onwards we shall denote by χI the characteristic function of the in-

terval I = [−δ, δ] ⊆ [−1/2, 1/2], with δ to be chosen later.

From (2.1) it follows that

(3.1)

χI (θp(f ) − θp(g)) ≤ SM (θp(f ) − θp(g)) .

By the Fourier series expansion of SM (x), (3.1) can be written as

(3.2)

χI (θp(f ) − θp(g)) ≤

MX−M bSM (n)e (n (θp(f ) − θp(g)))

Thus the number of normalized Hecke eigenforms f, g ∈ Sk(N ) such that θp(f ) =
θp(g) is

≤Xf 6=g

χI (θp(f ) − θp(g)) + dim Sk(N ) =Xf,g

χI (θp(f ) − θp(g))

For reasons that will become apparent later, it is convenient to write this as

since χI is an even function. By (3.2), this is

It is this sum that appears in the Eichler-Selberg trace formula and is thus amenable
to estimation. In the next sections, we examine ways to estimate this sum.

4. A heuristic argument

We shall ﬁrst give a heuristic argument to show that the estimate in the theorem
is bounded by O((dim Sk(N )) . In his 1997 paper [6], Serre proved that the θp’s are
equidistributed as f varies with respect to a p-Sato-Tate measure. This was made
eﬀective with error term by Ram Murty and Kaneenika Sinha in [4] using the
Eichler-Selberg trace formula. More precisely, they gave precise estimates for

Xf

2 cos nθp(f ) − cn dim Sk(N ),

where c0 = 1, and cn = p−n/2 − p−(n−2)/2 for n even and zero if n is odd. It may
be reasonable to expect square root cancellation for the error term, that is,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xf

e(±nθp(f )) − cn dim Sk(N )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = O(cid:16)(dim Sk(N ))1/2(cid:17) .

4

M. RAM MURTY & K. SRINIVAS

Using the elementary inequality 2ab ≤ a2 + b2, we have |a + b|2 ≤ 2(|a|2 + |b|2),

With our assumption of square root cancellation, and taking δ = 1/M , equation
(3.4) is

so that

Thus, by taking M = dim Sk(N ), we obtain a ﬁnal estimate of

(4.2)

O (dim Sk(N )) .

This estimate is consistent with the conjectures of Maeda and Tsaknias. Indeed,
in the case of level 1, Maeda predicts that the polynomial (1.2) is irreducible and
so it should have no repeated roots. Thus the number of pairs (f, g) such that
θp(f ) = θp(g) is equal to dim Sk(1). In the higher level case, Tsaknias predicts the
number of Galois orbits is ﬁnite and so the polynomial (1.2) is product of a ﬁnite
number of irreducible polynomials with rational coeﬃcients. So in this case also,
we expect the number to be bounded by a constant multiple of dim Sk(N ).

5. Proof of the main theorem

What can be proved unconditionally? Recall that we want to ﬁnd a non-trivial

achieved by using the following result of Ram Murty and Kaneenika Sinha (see
[4], Theorem 18 ) which we state as

bound for the exponential sum | Pf e(±nθp(f )) |2 appearing earlier. This is
LEMMA 1. Deﬁne f (N ) asPc|N φ(gcd(c, N/c)), and denote by ν(N ) the number

of distinct prime divisors of N . Let

Let c0 = 1 and for m ≥ 1, let

Then,

where δm(k) = 0 unless k = 2 in which case it is equal to 2pm/2.

As mentioned in (11) of [4], the bound in the previous lemma can be replaced by
p3m/22ν(N ) log pm + √N d(N ). We have proved above that the quanity in question
is given by (3.4). We choose δ = 1/M . Then our quantity is

We need to make an optimal choice of M . As the referee suggests, this is best
done by using the Lambert W -function. We refer the reader to [1] (see especially
Appendix A) for a friendly introduction to this function. Recall that this function
is deﬁned by

W (x)eW (x) = x.

Our choice of M will be so that the ﬁrst two terms in the above estimate are
comparable. That is, we seek M so that

(dim Sk(N ))2 = p3M M 3(log p)2.

Since dim Sk(N ) lies somewhere between kN and kN log log N , our M should
(essentially) satisfy

(kN )2(log p) = p3M M 3(log p)3.

Thus,

The Lambert function satisﬁes

M log p = W(cid:16)(kN )2/3(log p)1/3(cid:17) .

as x tends to inﬁnity, we deduce that M can be taken as the nearest integer to

W (x) = log x − log log x + o(1)

6. Concluding Remarks

There are other predictions of the conjectures of Maeda and Tsaknias. For
instance, both conjectures predict that for a ﬁxed N , the number of normalized
Hecke eigenforms with integers coeﬃcients is at most 1 (in the level one case) and
ON (1) in the higher level case. In the latter case, the constant is expected to be
independent of k. Such questions were investigated in [4] where similar methods
and estimates were derived.
