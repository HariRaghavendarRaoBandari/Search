CURVES BETWEEN LIPSCHITZ AND C1 AND THEIR RELATION TO

GEOMETRIC KNOT THEORY

SIMON BLATT

Abstract. In this article we investigate regular curves whose derivatives have vanishing
mean oscillations. We show that smoothing these curves using a standard molliﬁer one
gets regular curves again.

We apply this result to solve a couple of open problems. We show that curves with ﬁnite
3
2 ,2 such that
M¨obius energy can be approximated by smooth curves in the energy space W
the energy converges which answers a question of He. Furthermore, we extend the result of
Scholtes on the Γ-convergence of the discrete M¨obius energies towards the M¨obius energy
and prove conjectures of Ishizeki and Nagasawa on certain parts of a decomposition of the
M¨obius energy. Finally, we extend a theorem of Wu on inscribed polygons to curves with
derivatives with vanishing mean oscillation.

1. Introduction

Approximating functions by functions with better regularity properties was, is, and will
certainly remain to be one of the most important techniques in analysis. In this short note
we want to contribute to this topic. We consider regular closed curves with regularity
somewhere between C1 and merely Lipschitz continuity. One ends up looking at such
curves, if one assumes that the curve is parametrized by arc-length and lies in some critical
fractional Sobolev space W1+s, 1
s , s ∈ (0, 1) - which is known not to embed into C1. But
still the fact that the curve is of class W1+s, 1
s gives us some subtle new information on
the derivative that we will use in this article. For example, the derivative of the curve
γ : R/Z → Rn then belongs to the space V MO(R/Z, Rn) of all functions with vanishing
mean oscillation, i.e.

Though for merely regular curves γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) we cannot expect that the smoothened
functions γε are regular curves, the situation changes drastically, if we assume that γ′ has
vanishing mean oscillation. We will start with proving the following surprising theorem:
Theorem 1.1. Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) be a curve parametrized by arc-length with γ′ ∈
V MO(R/Z, Rn). For ε > 0 we consider the smoothened functions γε = γ ∗ ηε. Then the
ε| converges uniformly to |γ′| = 1. So especially, the
absolute value of the derivative |γ′
curves γε are regular if ε is small enough.

Sometimes one might need that also the approximating curves are parametrized by arc-
length and have the same length as the original curve. In this case the following theorem
can help. For denote the length of a curve γ by L(γ).
Theorem 1.2. Let ˜γε : R/Z → Rn be the re-parametrization by arc-length of the unit
L(γε) γε(0). Then ˜γε still converges to the curve γ
length curve
in W 3

L(γε) γε that satisﬁes ˜γε(0) = 1

Though the proof of the Theorem 1.1 is extraordinarily elementary and short, it is the
impression of the author that this result and the techniques that lead to it are unknown
to the community. In the last section, we will show how to apply the techniques of this
article in order to answer some open questions in the literature and settle some conjectures
in the context of knot energies. All the statements of the theorems are known for curves
that possess more regularity than we can naturally assume. The approximation techniques
above allow to extend these statements to curves of bounded M¨obius energy – which is
the most natural assumption for these theorems. Let us just pick out one particular open
question due to Zheng-Xu He.

Jun O’Hara introduced the M¨obius energy [O’H91]

for regular curves γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) which was the ﬁrst geometric implementation of
the concept of knot energy. In the inﬂuential paper [FHW94], Freedman, He, and Wang
discussed many interesting properties of this energy including its invariance under M¨obius
transformations.

In his article [He00], Zheng-Xu He asked whether any regular curve of bounded M¨obius
energy can be approximated by smooth curves such that the energy converges. We will use
the above approximation result together with the characterization of curves of ﬁnite M¨obius
energy in [Bla12] to give the following answer:
Theorem 1.3. Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) be a curve parametrized by arc-length such that
O’Hara’s M¨obius energy Em¨ob(γ) is bounded. Then there is a constant ε0 > 0 such that
γε are smooth regular curves for all 0 < ε < ε0 converging to γ in the fractional Sobolev
space W 3

2 ,2 and in energy, i.e. E2(γε) → E2(γ) for ε → 0.

We hope that the list of applications, although far from being complete, convinces the
reader that the results and techniques developed in this article are of great importance for
the analysis of critical knot energies for curves.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Setting

for r ≤ 1

|γ′ − ar|dy = o(1)

We calculate using the triangle inequality and the estimate above

(2.1)

|ar| =

Br(x)

|ar|dy ≥

as r → 0.

So we derive

1

2r Z (cid:0)|γ′| − ||ar| − |γ′||(cid:1) ≥ 1 − Z

Br(x)

|ar − γ′|dx ≥ 1 − o(1)

Bε(0)

|γ′(x − y) − aε||ηε(y)|dy

≥ |aε| − Co(1) ≥ 1 − o(1),

where we used the deﬁnition of V MO and (2.1). Hence, |γ′
ε| → |γ′| = 1 uniformly and
especially γ is a regular curve for ε > 0 small enough. This completes the proof of Theo-
rem 1.1.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let us now consider the curves ˜γε which apparently converge to γ
uniformly and hence especially in L2. We now show that the derivatives of these curves
satisfy

"E

|˜γ′

ε(x) − ˜γ′

But, as ψ−1 is a Lipschitz mapping, we get that there is an ˜δ > 0 such that |E| ≤ ˜δ implies
|ψ−1(E)| and hence

"E

Thus, Iε is uniformly integrable and we can apply Vitali’s theorem to prove the claim.

3. Applications

(cid:3)

We want to present several applications of Theorem 1.1. We will start with analyz-
ing the convergence of the M¨obius energy and the parts of its decomposition found by
Ishikezi and Nagasawa if the original curve has bounded M¨obius energy. Unfortunately,
the smoothened curves γε in general do not converge in W1,∞ – so we cannot apply the fact
that the M¨obius energy is C1 in W 3
2 ,2 ∩ W1,∞ [BRS15, Theorem II]. We will show how to
ε| from Theorem 1.1 together with bi-Lipschitz estimates in order
use the convergence of |γ′
to prove convergence in energy.

3.1. Fractional Sobolev Spaces. For the rest of the article we need the classiﬁcation of
curves of ﬁnite energy Eα in [Bla12] using fractional Sobolev spaces. For s ∈ (0, 1), p ∈
[1, ∞) and k ∈ N0 the space Wk+s,p(R/Z, Rn) consists of all functions f ∈ Wk,p(R/R, Rn)

thorough discussion of the subject of fractional Sobolev space we point the reader to the
monograph of Triebel [Tri83]. Chapter 7 of [AF03] and the very nicely written and easy
accessible introduction to the subject [DNPV12].

The following result is a special case of Theorem 1.1 in [Bla12]:

Theorem 3.1 (Classiﬁcation of curves with ﬁnite M¨obius energy). Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn)
be a curve parametrized by arc-length. Then the M¨obius energy Em¨ob(γ) is ﬁnite if and
only if γ is bi-Lipschitz and belongs to W 3

2 ,2(R/Z, Rn).

In the following, we will use the well-known fact, that f ∈ W s,p(R/Z, Rn), s ∈ (0, 1),

s , implies f ∈ V MO. This follows for example from the line of inequalities

Applying this to f = γ′, in view of Theorem 3.1 the velocity of a curve parametrized by

arc-length of ﬁnite M¨obius energy belongs to V MO. Hence, we can apply Theorem 1.1.

3.2. Convergence of Some Critical Knot Energies.

3.2.1. The M¨obius Energy. As a ﬁrst application, we want to answer a question due to
He [He00][Question 8 in Section 7]. Zhen-Xu He asked, whether a curve of bounded
M¨obius energy can be approximated by smooth curves such that the energies of these
curves converge to the energy of the initial curve. Then following lemma shows that this
is indeed the case and that one can just use the molliﬁed curves γε. This lemma together
with Theorem 1.1 obviously proves Theorem 1.3.
Lemma 3.2 (Convergence of the M¨obius energy). Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) be parametrized
by arc-length of ﬁnite M¨obius energy. Then we have Em¨ob(γε) → E(γ).

Proof. We use Vitali’s convergence theorem to prove this lemma. Setting Iγ(z, w) :=

1

|γ(x+w)−γ(x)|2 −

ε| converges pointwise to |γ′| by Theorem 1.1 and γε converges to γ pointwise, the
As |γ′
integrand Iγε(x, w) also converges to Iγ(x, w) pointwise. Let us show that the integrands
are uniformly integrable. For this purpose we only have to consider points close to the
diagonal, i.e. we will only integrate over x, y ∈ R/Z with |x − y| ≤ 1
4 , since on the rest of
the domain the bi-Lipschitz estimate gives us a uniform bound on the integrand.

3.2.2. Ishizeki’s and Nagasawa’s Decomposition of the M¨obius Energy. In [IN15] Ishizeki
and Nagasawa found the decomposition

E1(γ) := "(R/Z)2

As in the proof of Lemma 3.2, we can show

Lemma 3.3. Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rn) be a curve of bounded M¨obius energy. Then

E1(γε) = E1(γ)

and

lim
ε→0

E2(γε) = E2(γ).

lim
ε→0

Proof. It is enough to show the convergence for E1, as the statement for E2 follows from
the decomposition

Em¨ob = E1 + E2 + 4

by Ishizeki and Nagasawa [IN15]. As γ has bounded M¨obius energy, we know that γ′ ∈
V MO. Theorem 1.1 shows that the integrand in the deﬁnition of E1 converges pointwise.
From the bi-Lipschitz estimate we furthermore get

We have shown in the proof of Lemma 3.2 that the right-hand side in uniformly integrable –
and thus the integrands in the deﬁnition of E1 are uniformly integrable and Vitali’s theorem
implies the assertion.

3.3. Proof of a Conjecture of Ishizeki and Nagasawa. In [IN15], Ishizeki and Nagasawa
proved that for all curves γ in C1,1 we have E1(γ) ≥ 2π2 and conjectured that the same is
also true under the weaker but more natural condition γ ∈ W 3
2 ,2. Using the techniques we
developed so far, we can now prove this conjecture quite easily.

Theorem 3.4 (A conjecture of Nagasawa and Ishizeki). We have E1(γ) ≥ 2π2 for all
regular curves γ ∈ W 3

2 ,2(R/Z, R3).

Proof. Let γε = γ ∗ ηε. Since

E1(γε) → E1(γ)

and E(γε) ≥ 2π2 as the inequality holds for smooth curves, we get E1(γ) ≥ 2π2.

(cid:3)

In the same paper, Ishizeki and Nagasawa also showed the M¨obius invariance of the
energies E1 and E2 for curves of bounded M¨obius energy except for one important case:
the case of an inversion on a sphere centered on the curve. For applications this seems to
be one of the most important cases. We can now prove also this last case – and thus obtain
full M¨obius invariance of the energies E1, E2 for curves of bounded M¨obius energy.

Theorem 3.5. Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z) be a regular curve with bounded M¨obius energy and I be
an inversion on a sphere centered on γ. Then

E1(I ◦ γ) = E1(γ) − 2π2

and

E2(I ◦ γ) = E2(γ) + 2π2.

Proof. We will show how to deduce this theorem form the M¨obius invariance for smooth
curves and the invariance of the M¨obius energy. We only have to show the statement for
E1 as due to a theorem of Ishizeki and Nagasawa the sum

E1 + E2

is known to be invariant under all M¨obius transformations [IN14].

Let us assume that γ is parametrized by arc length. We set γε := γ ∗ ηε and assume
without loss of generality, that 0 is the center of the inversion I. Then we can ﬁnd xε → 0
such that 0 ∈ γε(R/Z) + xε. Let us denote by ˜γε : R → Rn a re-parameterization of I ◦ γε
by arc-length such that ˜γε(0) = (I ◦ γε)(0) and let ˜γ : R → Rn a re-parameterization of I ◦ γ
by arc-length such that ˜γ(0) = (I ◦ γ)(0). Then ˜γε converges pointwise to ˜γ.

The proof now relies on the following

Claim 3.6. We have

Let us prove the statement for E1 in our theorem using this claim. On the one hand

Lemma 3.3 and the M¨obius invariance for smooth curves implies

E1(˜γε) + 2π2 = E1(I ◦ (γε + xε)) + 2π2 = E1(γε + xε) ε↓0

−−→ E1(γ).

(3.3)
On the other hand, we use the estimate

ε(x1)||˜γ′

ε(x2)| ≤ C

and follow the argument in the proof of Lemma 3.2 to see that the integrands in the deﬁni-
tion of the energies E1(˜γε) satisfy the assumptions of Vitali’s theorem. Hence,
(3.4)

E1(˜γε) = E1(˜γ).

lim

But (3.3) and (3.4) imply

E1(˜γ) + 2π2 = E(γ).

(cid:3)

Proof of Claim 3.6. We will show that the integrands appearing in the deﬁnition of

converge pointwise to 0 and are uniformly integrable. Then the claim follows from Vitali’s
theorem. These integrands are

2 ,2(R)

W

|(˜γε(x) − ˜γ(x)) − (˜γε(y) − ˜γ(y))|2

|x − y|2

As ˜γε converges pointwise to ˜γ, this integrands converge pointwise to 0 for all x , y.
Let us now ﬁrst deal with the point ∞ and show that for every δ > 0 there is an R > 0

such that

(3.5)

"R2\(BR)2

|˜γ′

ε(x) − ˜γ′

dxdy ≤ δ

for all ε > 0 small enough. For this we use the M¨obius invariance of M¨obius energy
[FHW94, Theorem 2.1]. Together with Fatou’s lemma the latter implies

Em¨ob(˜γ) ≤ lim
ε→0

Em¨ob(˜γε) = lim
ε→0

Em¨ob(γε) − 4 = Em¨ob(γ) − 4 = E(˜γ).

Hence,

(3.6)

lim
ε→0

Em¨ob(˜γε) = Em¨ob(˜γ).

For δ > 0 we now choose R > 0 such that

Then

EBR(0)(˜γε) ≥ Em¨ob(˜γ) − 2δ

for ε > 0 small enough since else the lower semi-continuity of the M¨obius energy would
imply

EBR(0)(˜γ) ≤ lim inf
ε→0
In view of (3.6) we even obtain

EBR(0)(˜γε) ≤ Em¨ob(˜γ) − 2δ ≤ EBR(0)(˜γ) − δ

Em¨ob(˜γ) + 2δ ≥ Em¨ob(˜γε) ≥ EBR(0)(˜γε) ≥ Em¨ob(˜γ) − 2δ

for all ε > 0 suﬃciently small and hence

Of course, one only has to show that the ﬁrst summand in uniformly integrable. Let s(x)
be the re-parametrization that satisﬁes ˜γε(x) = I ◦ γε ◦ s and δ > 0 be such that (−R, R) ⊂
(I ◦ γε)((R/Z) \ Bδ(0)) and ψ(x, y) := (s(x), s(y)). As in the proof of Theorem 1.2 we get for

With the help of Theorem3.5, we can now also discuss the case of equality in Theo-

rem 3.4 to get the following extension of Corollary 4.1 in [IN15].

Theorem 3.7. We have E1(γ) ≥ 2π2 for all regular curves γ ∈ W 3
if and only if γ is a circle.

2 ,2(R/Z, R3) with equality

We omit the proof of Theorem 3.7 as it is literally the same as the proof of Corollary 4.1

in [IN15] where one only uses Theorem 3.5 instead of Theorem 1.2 in [IN15].

3.4. Γ-convergence of the Discrete M¨obius Energies of Scholtes. Let us extend the Γ-
convergence result of Scholtes in [Sch14]. Scholtes introduced the discretized M¨obius
energy

of a polygon p : R/Z → Rn with vertices p(ai), ai ∈ [0, 1), i = 1, . . . , m.

Theorem 3.8 (Γ-convergence of discrete M¨obius energies). Let q ∈ [1, ∞). We have

En

Γ
−→ Em¨ob

on the space of curves C0,1(R/Z, Rn) of unit velocity equipped with the Lq and W1,q-norm.

Scholtes proved this theorem for curves which are in C1 – which again is not implied

by bounded M¨obius energy.

Proof. Since the lim inf-inequality was already shown by Scholtes, we only have to proof
the lim sup inequality. Scholtes has already shown that the lim sup inequality holds for C1
curves. If now γ is a regular curves with bounded M¨obius energy, we can consider the
smoothened curves γε = γ ∗ ηε. By Lemma 3.2 we have limm→∞ Em¨ob(γ 1
) = Em¨ob(γ). By

3.5. Inscribing Equilateral polygons. With the tools we have at hand, we can also extend
a result of Wu [Wu04] on inscribed regular polygons in the following way
Theorem 3.9. Let γ ∈ C0,1(R/Z, Rd) be a regular curve with γ′ ∈ V MO. Then for every
n ∈ N, n ≥ 2 and any x0 ∈ R/Z there is an inscribed n-gon starting with the point γ(x0).

The proof is based on the fact, that there is a lower bound cn > 0 of the Gromov
distortion of equilateral n-gons as the inﬁmum of the Gromov distortion is attained for an
equilateral n-gon and thus cannot be 0.

Proof. Let γε = ηε ∗ γ be the standard molliﬁed curves and pk the inscribed, equilat-
eral n-gon with point γ 1
is a regular curve. We ﬁrst note that
infk∈N diam pk = 0 would imply

(x0) for k so large that γ 1
