TWO TYPES OF INVARIANT SUBSPACES IN THE POLYDISC

BEYAZ BAS¸AK KOCA

Abstract. It is known that the structure of invariant subspaces of the Hardy
space H 2(Dn) on the polydisc Dn is very complicated; hence, we need good
examples help us to understand the structure of invariant subspaces of H 2(Dn).
In this paper, we deﬁne two types of invariant subspaces of H 2(Dn). Then,
we give a characterization of these types invariant subspaces in view of the
Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem. Unitary equivalence is also studied in this
paper.

1. Introduction

It is well-known that Beurling [2] showed that every invariant subspaces M of
the Hardy space H 2(D) on the unit disc D is of the form M = f H 2(D) for some
inner function f i.e., is generated by a single inner function (Beurling-type in-
variant subspaces). However, in the polydisc case, the structure of the invariant
subspaces cannot be characterized in such a simple form. Although it is clear that
the Beurling-type subspaces are also invariant, determining all invariant subspaces
of H 2(Dn) is diﬃcult. In [3], Jacewicz gave an example of an invariant subspace
of H 2(D2) that can be generated by two functions and can not be generated by a
single function. Later, Rudin also showed in [4] gave an example of an invariant
subspace of H 2(D2) that is not even ﬁnitely generated. Therefore one may natu-
rally ask for a classiﬁcation or an explicit description (in some sense) of all invariant
subspaces of H 2(Dn). This question was asked by Rudin in his book [4, p.78] and it
is still open. Recently, for n = 2, two types of important invariant subspaces known
as inner-sequence based invariant subspaces and invariant subspaces generated by
two inner functions have been extensively studied by various authors in diﬀerent
context(see [6, 9, 8, 7, 11, 12]). In this paper, inspired from these studies, we deﬁne
two new types of invariant subspaces of H 2(Dn) by considering a larger class of
functions than inner functions. Then, we deal with the structure of these invariant
subspaces in view of the Beurling-Lax-Halmos theorem. Our method is the same
with the work done in [7]. However, our examples of invariant subspaces and results
related to them improve and generalize results proved for n = 2 in [7].

Before starting, we will give preliminary deﬁnitions and few important results

that we will use in this study.

Let n be a positive integer. The open unit disc in C is denoted by D; its boundary
is the circle T . The polydisc Dn and its distinguished boundary, the torus, T n are

the subsets of Cn (n > 1) which are cartesian products of n copies of D and T ,
respectively.

The Hardy space on the polydisc H 2(Dn) is deﬁned as

H 2(Dn) = {f (z) : z ∈ Dn, f (z) =Xα

c(α)zα, α ∈ Zn

+, Xα

|c(α)|2 < ∞}

In fact, ||f ||2 = {Pα |c(α)|2}1/2. For f (z) ∈ H 2(Dn), the radial limit

f (rz)

f ∗(z) = lim
r→1

exists at almost every z ∈ T n.

H ∞(Dn) is the space of all bounded analytic functions in Dn; ||f ||∞ = supz∈Dn |f (z)|.

An inner function in Dn is a function g ∈ H ∞(Dn) with |g∗| = 1 a.e. on T n.

Recall a subspace M of H 2(Dn) is called “invariant” if (a) M is closed linear
subspace of H 2(Dn) and (b) f ∈ M implies zif ∈ M for i = 1, . . . , n; i.e., mul-
tiplication by the variables z1, z2, . . . , zn maps M into M . The smallest invariant
subspace of H 2(Dn) which contains a given f is denoted by Mf and Mf is called
the subspace generated by f if Mf = f H 2(Dn). For further information for Hardy
space on the polydisc, see [4].

In [5], the author and Sadık completely characterized the singly-generated in-

variant subspaces of H 2(Dn) as follows:

Theorem 1.1. [5, Theorem 2.1] Let f ∈ H ∞(U n). The subspace f H 2(U n) of
H 2(U n) is invariant if and only if f is a generalized inner function.

Here a generalized inner function means that f ∈ H ∞(U n) with f −1 ∈ L∞(T n).
Here it is clear that f −1 = 1/f ∗. The authors also constructed a singly generated
invariant subspace that can not be Beurling type [5, Theorem 2.3].

We recall the class of analytic vector valued functions. Let K be an inﬁnite

dimensional separable Hilbert space. Then

H 2(K) = {f (z) : z ∈ D, f (z) =

xnzn, xn ∈ K,

∞

Xn=0

||xn||2

K < ∞},

Xn=0

where || · ||K denotes the norm of the space K. Clearly, H 2(K) is a Hilbert space
under the inner product

(xnyn), where f (z) =

xnzn and g(z) =

ynzn.

Also, ||f ||2

The set of all bounded operator-valued analytic functions on D with values in

the algebra B(K) of bounded linear operators on the space K is deﬁned by

H ∞(B(K)) = {W : W (z) =

∞

Xn=0

Anzn, z ∈ D, An ∈ B(K), sup
z∈D

||W (z)||B(K) < ∞}.

Also, ||W ||∞ = supz∈D ||W (z)||B(K).

INVARIANT SUBSPACES OF H 2(Dn)

It is obvious that every element W ∈ H ∞(B(K)) gives rise to a bounded linear
operator to H 2(K), i.e, to an element W , we correspond an operator ˆW on H 2(K)
that is deﬁned by the formula

( ˆW ϕ)(z) = W (z)ϕ(z), z ∈ D.

For more detail on the space of all vector-valued analytic functions, see [10].

A function W ∈ H ∞(B(K)) is called operator inner if the pointwise a.e. bound-

ary values are isometries:

(W (ξ))∗W (ξ) = IK for almost all ξ ∈ T.

Theorem 1.2. [10, Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem] A subspace M of H 2(K) is
invariant under the multiplication operators by the independent variable if and only
if M is of the form M = ˆΘH 2(K) for some operator inner function Θ.

The following property is well-known:

Lemma 1.3. For n > 1, H 2(Dn) = H 2(H 2(Dn−1))

Combining with Lemma (1.3) and Theorem (1.2), we obtain the full description
of invariant subspace of H 2(Dn) under the multiplication operator by the variable
z1 as follows:
Corollary 1.4. A subspace M of H 2(Dn) = H 2(H 2(Dn−1)) is invariant under the
multiplication operator by the variable z1 if and only if M = ˆΘH 2(H 2(Dn−1)) for
some operator inner function Θ ∈ H ∞(B(H 2(Dn−1))).

2. Sequence-Based Invariant Subspaces

Deﬁnition 2.1. An invariant subspace M of H 2(Dn) is called sequence-based if it
is of the form

(2.1)

fl(z1, . . . , zn−1)H 2(Dn−1)zl
n,

M =Ml≥0

where the sequence {fl}l≥0 consists of functions having the following properties:

(I) fl ∈ H ∞(Dn−1) with f −1
(II) fl is divisible by fl+1 for any l, i.e., every (fl/fl+1) satisﬁes the condition

l ∈ L∞(Tn−1) for any l,

(I).

It is clear that M is invariant under the multiplication by the variables z1, . . . , zn−1.

Moreover, note that the condition (II) is equivalent to flH 2(Dn−1) is contained in
fl+1H 2(Dn−1). From this, we have

znflH 2(Dn−1)zl

n = flH 2(Dn−1)zl+1

n ⊂ fl+1H 2(Dn−1)zl+1
n .

This shows that M is also invariant under the multiplication by zn.

Remark that inner functions is properly contained in the class of all functions
f ∈ H ∞(Dn) with f −1 ∈ L∞(T n) for any n > 1. In the case of n = 2, the inner
sequence based invariant subspaces are studied. The characterization of this type
of invariant subspaces is studied by Qin and Yang in [7, Theorem 2.1]. We now
give the following characterization of sequence- based invariant subspaces as same
manner of their proof.

Since the subspace M = Ll≥0 fl(z1, . . . , zn−1)H 2(Dn−1)zl

n is invariant, there
exists an operator inner function Θ(zn) ∈ H ∞(B(H 2(Dn−1))) by the Beurling-
Lax-Halmos theorem. Assume its power series representation

from H 2(Dn−1) onto f0H 2(Dn−1), and set Θ(zn) =Pl≥0 Plzl

3. Invariant Subspaces Generated by Two Functions

In this section we deal with the invariant subspace M of the form

M = f1(z1)H 2(Dn) + f2(z2, . . . , zn)H 2(Dn),

(3.1)
where f1(z1) ∈ H ∞(D) with f −1
1 ∈ L∞(T) and f2(z2, . . . , zn) ∈ H ∞(Dn−1) with
f −1
2 ∈ L∞(Tn−1). To see invariance of M it is enough to show that M is closed as
in [13, Lemma 2.4]. In fact, since

H 2(Dn) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn) =Ml≥0

zl(H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)),

H 2(Dn) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn) is invariant under the multiplication operator by z1. Then
f1(z1)(H 2(Dn) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn)) ⊥ f2H 2(Dn) and

M = f1H 2(Dn) + f2H 2(Dn)

= f1(H 2(Dn) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn)) ⊕ f2H 2(Dn) + f2H 2(Dn)
= f1(H 2(Dn) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn)) ⊕ f2H 2(Dn).

Hence M is closed.

For n = 2, the case of f1 and f2 are inner was studied in [13, 6, 7]. Following
their method in [7], we characterize M of the form (3.1) in terms of Θ(z1) corre-
sponding to M .

Before starting, we need the following lemma:

Lemma 3.1. If M is an invariant subspace of the form (3.1), then

M ⊖ z1M = f1(H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ f2H 2(Dn−1).

Proof. We prove the lemma as in [6, Lemma 3.2]. Given a pair of functions f1(z1)
and f2(z2, . . . , zn) corresponding to M , we can decompose H 2(Dn) as

(cid:0)(H 2(D) ⊖ f1H 2(D)) ⊕ f1H 2(D)(cid:1) ⊗(cid:0)(H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ f2H 2(Dn−1)(cid:1)

= (H 2(D)⊖f1H 2(D))⊗(H 2(Dn−1)⊖f2H 2(Dn−1))⊕(H 2(D)⊖f1H 2(D))⊗f2H 2(Dn−1)

⊕f1H 2(D) ⊗ (H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ f1H 2(D) ⊗ f2H 2(Dn−1).

By this equality we have

(H 2(D)⊖f1H 2(D))⊗(H 2(Dn−1)⊖f2H 2(Dn−1)) = H 2(Dn)⊖(f1H 2(D)+f2H 2(Dn−1)).

6

BEYAZ BAS¸AK KOCA

Relative to the decomposition
M = f1H 2(D) + f2H 2(Dn−1)

= (H 2(D) ⊖ f1H 2(D)) ⊗ f2H 2(Dn−1) ⊕ f1H 2(D) ⊗ (H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1))
⊕ f1H 2(D) ⊗ f2H 2(Dn−1).

Based on this equality, we can write M as

M = f1H 2(D) ⊗ (H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ H 2(D) ⊗ f2H 2(Dn−1)

and the lemma follows easily.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.2. Let Θ(z1) be the operator inner function for an invariant subspace
M . Then M is of the form (3.1) if and only if Θ(z1) = f1(z1)P0 + P1, where P1 is
a projection from H 2(Dn−1) to an invariant subspace generated by a single function
and P0 is a complemented projection of P1, i.e., P0P1 = 0, P0 + P1 = I.

Proof. Suppose that M is of the form (3.1). By Lemma (3.1) we have
M ⊖ z1M = f1(H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ f2H 2(Dn−1).

Set Θ(z1) = f1P0 + P1, where P0 : H 2(Dn−1) → H 2(Dn−1) ⊖ f2H 2(Dn−1) is the
orthogonal projection and P1 = I − P0. Then, for every h ∈ H 2(Dn−1), by the
Pythagorean theorem,

||Θ(z1)h||2 = |f1(z1)|2||P0h||2 + ||P1h||2 = ||P0h||2 + ||P1h||2 = ||h||2.

This shows that Θ is an operator inner function. Further, we have

Θ(z1)H 2(Dn−1) = f1P0H 2(Dn−1) + P1H 2(Dn−1) = M ⊖ z1M,

and hence

∞

M =

zn
1 (M ⊖ z1M ) = Θ(z1)H 2(Dn).

Mn=0

Conversely, suppose Θ(z1) = f1(z1)P0 + P1, where f1 is inner, P1 is a projection
from H 2(Dn−1) to an invariant subspace generated by a single function and P0 is
a complemented projection of P1. Then
(3.2) M = Θ(z1)H 2(Dn) = f1(H 2(D) ⊗ P0H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ (H 2(D) ⊗ P1H 2(Dn−1))

First, we show that for all i = 2, . . . , n, the multiplication operators by zi, Tzi
and P1 commute on M . Denote M0 = H 2(D) ⊗ P0H 2(Dn−1) and M1 = H 2(D) ⊗
P1H 2(Dn−1), and let PM0 and PM1 stand for the projections from H 2(Dn) to M0
and M1, respectively. Then, with respect to the decomposition (3.2) we rewrite
Tzi, i = 2, . . . , n on M as

Tzi =(cid:18) PM0 TziPM0 PM0 TziPM1

PM1 TziPM0 PM1 TziPM1 (cid:19) , i = 2, . . . , n

Since M is invariant under Tzi, i = 2, . . . , n, we have

i.e.,

(3.3)

PM1 TziPM0 PM1 TziPM1 (cid:19)(cid:18) f1M0
(cid:18) PM0 TziPM0 PM0 TziPM1

M1 (cid:19) ⊂(cid:18) f1M0

M1 (cid:19) ,

f1PM1 TziM0 + PM1 TziM1 (cid:19) ⊂(cid:18) f1M0
(cid:18) f1PM0 TziM0 + PM0 TziM1

M1 (cid:19) .

INVARIANT SUBSPACES OF H 2(Dn)

Consider the ﬁrst line in (3.3). It is clear that f1PM0 TziM0 ⊂ f1M0, and hence
PM0 TziM1 ⊂ f1M0. It is easy computed that PM0 TziM1 = H 2(D)⊗P0ziP1H 2(Dn−1)
and f1M0 = f1H 2(D) ⊗ P0H 2(Dn−1). Therefore, since f1 is non-trivial, the ﬁrst
inclusion in (3.3) holds only if P0ziP1H 2(Dn−1) = {0}, i = 2, . . . , n. This im-
plies ziP1H 2(Dn−1) ⊂ P1H 2(Dn−1), i = 2, . . . , n, i.e., P1H 2(Dn−1) is invariant
subspace of H 2(Dn−1) and by assumption it is generated by a single function
f2(z2, . . . , zn) ∈ H ∞(Dn−1) ,i.e., P1H 2(Dn−1) = f2H 2(Dn−1).
It follows from
Theorem (1.1) that f −1
M = f1(H 2(D) ⊗ P0H 2(Dn−1)) ⊕ (H 2(D) ⊗ f2H 2(Dn−1)) = f1H 2(Dn) + f2H 2(Dn).

2 ∈ L∞(Tn−1). Finally, we have

(cid:3)

4. Unitary Equivalence

Two invariant subspaces M1 and M2 of H 2(Dn) are said to be unitarily equivalent
if there is a unitary operator U : M1 → M2 such that U (ϕf ) = ϕ(U f ) for ϕ ∈
H ∞(Dn) and f ∈ M1. Agrawal, Clark and Douglas [1] study the question of unitary
equivalence of invariant subspaces of H 2(Dn). Speciﬁcally, unitary equivalence of
inner-based invariant subspaces and invariant subspaces generated by two inner
functions of H 2(D2) are studied by Seto [9] and Yang [6], respectively.
In this
section we determine unitary equivalence of sequence-based invariant subspaces
and invariant subspaces generated by two functions of H 2(Dn), separately.

Theorem 4.1. Let M1 and M2 denoted sequence-based invariant subspace of H 2(Dn)
corresponding to sequences {fl(z1, . . . , zn−1)}l≥0 and {gl(z1, . . . , zn−1)}l≥0, respec-
tively. Then M1 and M2 unitarily equivalent if and only if there exists a unimodular
function h(z1, . . . , zn−1) depending only variables z1, . . . , zn−1 such that M2 = hM1.

Proof. If M1 and M2 are unitarily equivalent, there exists a unimodular function
h(z1, . . . , zn) such that M2 = hM1 by Lemma 1 in [1]. Since hg0 and hf0 are in
H 2(Dn), h is zn-analytic and conjugate zn-analytic. Hence h depends only variables
z1, . . . , zn−1. The converse is trivial.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.2. Let f1(z1), g1(z1) be inner functions and f2(z2, . . . , zn), g2(z2, . . . , zn)
be functions in H ∞(Dn−1) with f −1

2 ∈ L∞(Tn−1) and

2 , g−1

M1 = f1H 2(Dn) + f2H 2(Dn), M2 = g1H 2(Dn) + g2H 2(Dn).

Then M1 is unitarily equivalent to M2 only if M1 = M2.

Proof. By Lemma 2.1 in [6], there is an inner function φ such that M2 = φM1.
Since it implies M1 = ¯φM2, ¯φ is also inner. Then φ is constant. This proves the
theorem.
