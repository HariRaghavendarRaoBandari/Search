Abstract

This study investigates unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum walks.
We prove that one-dimensional quantum walks are unitary equivalent to quantum
walks of Ambainis type and that translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walks
are Szegedy walks. We also present a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a one-
dimensional quantum walk to be a Szegedy walk.

Introduction

This study investigates unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum walks. A
quantum walk is deﬁned by a pair (U,{Hv}v∈V ), where V is a countable set, {Hv}v∈V is a
family of separable Hilbert spaces, and U is a unitary operator on H =Lv∈V Hv [16]. For a
given quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ), we can deﬁne a graph G = (V, D) [7,8,16]. In this paper,
we consider primarily one-dimensional quantum walks, which have been the subject of many
studies [1–6, 10–17, 19].

It is important to clarify when we think of two quantum walks as being the same. We
consider unitary equivalence of quantum walks in the sense of [16]. If two quantum walks
are unitary equivalent, then their graphs and dimensions of their Hilbert spaces are the
same. Moreover, the probability distributions of the quantum walks are also the same.
Consequently, we can think of unitary equivalent quantum walks as being the same.

Unitary equivalent classes of simple quantum walks have been shown to be parameterized
by a single-parameter [5]. We extend this result and show that every translation-invariant
one-dimensional quantum walk is unitary equivalent to a simple quantum walk. Furthermore,
we prove that every one-dimensional quantum walk is unitary equivalent to one of Ambainis
type.

The Szegedy walk, whose original form was introduced in [18], is one of the well-investigated
quantum walks (see also [9,15,16]). We prove that every translation-invariant one-dimensional
quantum walk is a Szegedy walk and present a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a one-
dimensional quantum walk to be a Szegedy walk.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce some notations for
quantum walks in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the unitary equivalence of quantum
walks. In Section 4, we reveal the form of standard quantum walks. In Section 5, we prove
that every one-dimensional quantum walk is unitary equivalent to one of Ambainis type. In
Section 6, we clarify when a one-dimensional quantum walk becomes a Szegedy walk and
show that every translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk is a Szegedy walk.

2 Preliminaries

Let us recall the deﬁnition of quantum walks in the sense of [15, 16].

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let V be a countable set, {Hv}v∈V a family of separable Hilbert spaces, and
U a unitary on H = Lv∈V Hv. A quantum walk is a pair (U,{Hv}v∈V ), and we write
(U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW .
A (pure) quantum state is represented by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. For λ ∈ R,
quantum states ξ and eiλξ in H are identiﬁed. Hence, quantum walks (U,{Hv}v∈V ) and
(eiλU,{Hv}v∈V ) are also identiﬁed.
Let (U,{Hv}v∈V ) be a quantum walk. Pv ∈ B(H) is a projection onto Hv, and Uuv ∈
B(H) is an operator deﬁned by Uuv = PuUPv for all u, v ∈ V . An operator Uuv is also
considered as an operator in B(Hu,Hv), and we use the same notation if there is no confusion.
Given a quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW , we can construct a directed graph G =
(V, D). For vertices u, v ∈ V , the number of directed edges from v to u is denoted by
card(u, v); i.e.,

card(u, v) = card{e ∈ D : t(e) = u, o(e) = v},

where o(e) and t(e) are the origin and the terminus of the directed edge e, respectively, and
card indicates the cardinal number of a set.

Deﬁnition 2.2 For a quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW , deﬁne the number of directed
edges from v to u by

card(u, v) = rankUuv.

Then a graph (V, D) is called a graph of the quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ).

Next, we deﬁne a translation-invariant quantum walk. Translation-invariant one-dimensional

quantum walks are well known. Here, we extend the notion of translation-invariant quantum
walk to arbitrary graphs.

Deﬁnition 2.3 A bijection γ on V is called an automorphism on a graph (V, D) if

card(u, v) = card(γ(u), γ(v))

for all u, v ∈ V . A quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) is called translation invariant for γ if

Hv = Hγ(v)

and Uuv = Uγ(u)γ(v)

for all u, v ∈ V .

Now, we introduce three classes of quantum walks.

Deﬁnition 2.4 A quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW is called standard if the graph is
locally ﬁnite and symmetric, and satisﬁes

card{e ∈ D : o(e) = v} = dimHv

for all v ∈ V .

2

Note that a symmetric graph satisﬁes

card{e ∈ D : o(e) = v} = card{e ∈ D : t(e) = v}.

Deﬁnition 2.5 A quantum walk is called one-dimensional if dimHn = 2, and the graph of
the quantum walk satisﬁes V = Z and

D = {(n, n + 1), (n + 1, n) : n ∈ Z}

with card(n, n + 1) = card(n + 1, n) = 1 for all n ∈ Z.

We can canonically deﬁne an automorphism γ on the graph of a one-dimensional quantum

walk, i.e., γ(n) = n + 1 for n ∈ Z.
Deﬁnition 2.6 [15, 16, 18] A standard quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) is called a Szegedy walk
if there exist a self-adjoint unitary operator S on H, a real number λ ∈ R, and unit vectors
φv ∈ Hv such that eiλSU has the form

Cv

C =Mv∈V

where Cv = 2|φvihφv| − IHv on Hv. Here, the unitary operators S and C are called shift and
coin operators, respectively.

In the case of one-dimensional quantum walks, the operator Cv is a traceless self-adjoint

unitary operator.

Finally, we recall the probability distribution of a quantum walk.

Deﬁnition 2.7 Let (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW , and let Ψ0 be an initial state in H. The probability
µΨ0
t (v) of ﬁnding the quantum walker at time t ∈ Z+ and at vertex v is deﬁned by

µΨ0
t (v) = kPvU tΨ0k2.

3 Unitary equivalence of quantum walks

In this section, we consider the unitary equivalence of quantum walks.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (U1,{H(1)
v1 }v1∈V1) ∈ FQW and (U2,{H(2)
lent, written (U1,{H(1)
to Lv2∈V2 Hv2 and a bijection φ from V1 to V2 such that

v2 }v2∈V2) ∈ FQW are unitary equiva-
v2 }v2∈V2), if there exist a unitary W fromLv1∈V1 Hv1

v1 }v1∈V1) ≃ (U2,{H(2)

WHv1 = Hφ(v1)

and W U1W ∗ = U2.

We would like to regard unitary equivalent quantum walks as being the same. The next

proposition says that unitary equivalent quantum walks have the same graphs.
Proposition 3.2 Let (U1,{H(1)
v2 }v2∈V2) be quantum walks, and let G1 =
v1 }v1∈V1) and (U2,{H(2)
(V1, D1) and G2 = (V2, D2) be their graphs. If quantum walks (U1,{H(1)
are unitary equivalent by a unitary W , the graphs G1 = (V1, D1) and G2 = (V2, D2) are iso-
morphic; that is, there exists a bijection φ from V1 to V2 such that

v1 }v1∈V1) and (U2,{H(2)

v2 }v2∈V2)

card(u, v) = card(φ(u), φ(v)).

3

Proof. From the deﬁnition of unitary equivalence, there exists a bijection φ from V1 to V2.
A unitary W maps Hv1 to Hφ(v1), with the result that W Pv1W ∗ = Pφ(v1). Since card(u, v) =
rankPuU1Pv for u, v ∈ V1,

card(u, v) = rankPuU1Pv = rankW PuU1PvW ∗ = rankPφ(u)U2Pφ(v) = card(φ(u), φ(v)).

Hence, we obtain the proposition.

(cid:3)

v1 }v1∈V1) ∈ FQW and (U2,{H(2)

When (U1,{H(1)
v2 }v2∈V2) ∈ FQW are unitary equivalent, we
can identify V2 with V1 using the bijection φ, and write V = V1. Similarly, D1 and D2, and
H(1)
v and H(2)
v . Here, the unitary W
can be decomposed as

φ(v) can be identiﬁed, and we write D = D1 and Hv = H(1)

where Wv = PvW Pv.

Wv,

W =Mv∈V

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3.2.

Corollary 3.3 Let quantum walks (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) and (U2,{Hv}v∈V ) be unitary equivalent.
If (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) is standard or one-dimensional, then so is (U2,{Hv}v∈V ).

Unitary equivalence also preserves the properties of a Szegedy walk.

Proposition 3.4 Let quantum walks (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) and (U2,{Hv}v∈V ) be unitary equivalent
by a unitary W . If (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) is a Szegedy walk, then so is (U2,{Hv}v∈V ).
Proof. By the assumption, there exist a self-adjoint unitary S on H, a real number λ ∈ R,
and unit vectors φv ∈ Hv such that eiλSU1 has the form

Cv,

C =Mv∈V

where Cv = 2|φvihφv| − IHv. Then, W SW ∗ is also a self-adjoint unitary on H. Moreover,

eiλW SW ∗U2 = eiλW SU1W ∗ = W Mv∈V

CvW ∗ =Mv∈V
from which it follows that (U2,{Hv}v∈V ) is a Szegedy walk.

2|W φvihW φv| − IHv ,

(cid:3)

In general, a quantum walk that is unitary equivalent to a translation-invariant quantum
walk is not translation invariant. However, if we add a condition, then translation-invariance
is also preserved.

Proposition 3.5 Let (U,{Hn}n∈Z) be a translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk
such that Hn = Hn+1 for all n ∈ Z, and let W be a unitary on H that has the form

Wn,

W =Mn∈Z

where Wn is a unitary on Hn, and Wn = Wn+1 for all n ∈ Z. The quantum walk (W UW ∗,{Hn}n∈Z)
is a translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk.

4

Proof. It is suﬃcient to prove that W UW ∗ is translation invariant; i.e., PnW UW ∗Pm =
Pγ(n)W UW ∗Pγ(m). Since U is translation invariant,

PnW UW ∗Pm = WnPnUPmW ∗

m = WnUnmW ∗

m = Wγ(n)Uγ(n)γ(m)W ∗

γ(m)

= Wγ(n)Pγ(n)UPγ(m)W ∗

γ(m) = Pγ(n)W UW ∗Pγ(m).

Hence, W UW ∗ is translation invariant.

(cid:3)

Finally, we consider the probability distribution of a quantum walk. This does not change

under unitary equivalence.

Proposition 3.6 Let quantum walks (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) and (U2,{Hv}v∈V ) be unitary equivalent
by a unitary W , let Φ0 and W Φ0 in H be an initial state of (U1,{Hv}v∈V ) and (U2,{Hv}v∈V ),
respectively, and let µ(1),Φ0
be the probability distributions of the quantum walks
(U1,{Hv}v∈V ) and (U2,{Hv}v∈V ), respectively. Then,
(v) = µ(2),W Φ0

and µ(2),W Φ0

µ(1),Φ0

(v)

for all t ∈ Z+ and v ∈ V .
Proof. By the deﬁnition,

(v) = kPv(W U1W ∗)tW Φ0k2 = kW PvU t

1Φ0k2 = kPvU t

1Φ0k2 = µ(1),Φ0

Therefore, we obtain the proposition.

(v).

(cid:3)

One of the primary topics of study in connection with quantum walks is the probabil-
ity distributions of quantum walks, by virtue of which we can think of unitary equivalent
quantum walks as being the same. When we consider other properties of quantum walks,
additional properties, such as Proposition 3.5, must be considered.

4 Standard quantum walk

This study investigates one-dimensional quantum walks and Szegedy walks. Since both kinds
of quantum walk are standard, we clarify the form of a standard quantum walk.

Theorem 4.1 Let (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW be a standard quantum walk. There exist orthonor-
mal bases {ξe}e∈D and {ζe}e∈D of H with ξe ∈ Ht(e) and ζe ∈ Ho(e), such that

U =Xe∈D

|ξeihζe|.

Uuv = Xe:t(e)=u,o(e)=v

|ξeihζe|

Moreover, Uuv has the form

for any u, v ∈ V .

5

Proof. Since rankUuv = card{e ∈ V : t(e) = u, o(e) = v}, we can set {ξe : t(e) = u, o(e) =
v, e ∈ D} ⊂ Hu = Ht(e) as an orthonormal basis of ranUuv for all u, v ∈ V . Then, {ξe :
o(e) = v, e ∈ D} is an orthonormal system of H. An operator UPv is a partial isometry with
an initial projection Pv. The range of this operator is contained inLu∈V ranUuv = span{ξe :
o(e) = v, e ∈ D}, that is,

ranUPv ⊂ span{ξe : o(e) = v, e ∈ D}.

(1)

From the deﬁnition of a standard quantum walk, dimHv = card{e ∈ D : o(e) = v}. Since
the rank of the range projection of UPv is equal to the rank of the initial projection Pv,
rankUPv = card{e ∈ D : o(e) = v}. Considering the dimensions of the subspaces in (1),

ranUPv = span{ξe : o(e) = v, e ∈ D}.

Moreover, the range projection UPvU ∗ leaves span{ξe : o(e) = v, e ∈ D} unchanged. There-
fore, UPvU ∗ξe = ξe for all e ∈ D with o(e) = v, and this implies that PvU ∗ξe = U ∗ξe, with
the result that U ∗ξe ∈ Hv = Ho(e).
Let ζe = U ∗ξe. Since {ξe : o(e) = v, e ∈ D} is an orthonormal system, {ζe : o(e) = v, e ∈
D} is an orthonormal basis of Hv. Hence, {ζe : e ∈ D} is an orthonormal basis of H. Since
U is unitary and Uζe = ξe, {ξe : e ∈ D} is also an orthonomal basis of H, and

By the deﬁnition of Uuv, the equation

U =Xe∈D

|ξeihζe|.

Uuv = Xe:t(e)=u,o(e)=v

|ξeihζe|

also holds.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.2 For a standard quantum walk (U,{Hv}v∈V ) ∈ FQW , there exist a self-adjoint
unitary operator S on H and a unitary operator Tv on Hv (v ∈ V ) such that U = ST , where
T =Lv∈V Tv.
Proof. Since the graph of a standard quantum walk is symmetric, there exists a bijection on
D, denoted by e 7→ ¯e, for which t(e) = o(¯e), o(e) = t(¯e), and ¯¯e = e.

By Theorem 4.1, U can be written as

U =Xe∈D

|ξeihζe|.

Deﬁne S by Sξe = ξ¯e. S is a self-adjoint unitary; hence, S2 = I. Then,

|ξ¯eihζe|.

SU =Xe∈D

|ξ¯eihζe| =Mv∈V Xo(e)=v
Tv = Xo(e)=v
|ξ¯eihζe|

The operator

satisﬁes the assertion.

(cid:3)

Now, to clarify the explicit form of a shift operator S of a Szegedy walk, we present the

next lemma.

6

Lemma 4.3 Let (U,{Hv}v∈V ) be a Szegedy walk with a shift operator S and a coin operator
C, such that U = eiλSC for some λ ∈ R. Then,

S(ranUuv) = ranUvu

for any u, v ∈ V .
Proof. By Theorem 4.1, we can assume that there exist orthonormal bases {ξe}e∈D and
{ζe}e∈D of H with ξe ∈ Ht(e) and ζe ∈ Ho(e), such that
|ξeihζe|.

U =Xe∈D

Then, ranUuv = span{ξe : t(e) = u, o(e) = v, e ∈ D}. Since the coin operator C is written as
a direct sum of Cv,

Sξe = SUζe = eiλCζe ∈ Hv = Ho(e)

for all e ∈ D with t(e) = u and o(e) = v. This implies that S(ranUuv) ⊂ Hv. Furthermore,
by the form of U, Hv is decomposed as

Here,

ranUvw.

Hv = Mw∈V

ranUuv = S2(ranUuv) ⊂ SHv = Mw∈V

S(ranUvw).

Since S(ranUvw) ⊂ Hw and ranUuv ⊂ Hu, ranUuv ⊂ S(ranUvu). Considering the inversion
formula,

S(ranUuv) = ranUvu

for all u, v ∈ V .

Using this lemma, we have the next theorem.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.4 Let (U,{Hv}v∈V ) be a Szegedy walk with a shift operator S and a coin operator
C, such that U = eiλSC for some λ ∈ R. There exist orthonormal bases {ξe}e∈D and {ζe}e∈D
of H with ξe ∈ Ht(e) and ζe ∈ Ho(e) such that

U =Xe∈D

|ξeihζe|

and S =Xe∈D

|ξeihξ¯e|.

Proof. By Theorem 4.1, we can assume that there exist orthonormal bases {ξe}e∈D and
{ζe}e∈D of H with ξe ∈ Ht(e) and ζe ∈ Ho(e) such that
|ξeihζe|.

U =Xe∈D

By Lemma 4.3, S(ranUuv) = ranUvu. Moreover, in the proof of Theorem 4.1, the choice of
an orthonormal basis of ranUuv is arbitrary. Therefore, for an orthonormal basis {ξe : t(e) =
u, o(e) = v, e ∈ D} of ranUuv, we can redeﬁne ξ¯e = Sξe. Then, {ξ¯e : t(e) = u, o(e) = v, e ∈ D}
is an orthonormal basis of ranUvu. Consequently, we can obtain orthonormal bases {ξe}e∈D
and {ζe}e∈D of H with ξe ∈ Ht(e) and ζe ∈ Ho(e) such that
|ξeihζe| and S =Xe∈D

U =Xe∈D

|ξeihξ¯e|.

5 One-dimensional quantum walks

In this section, we consider a one-dimensional quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z). Without loss of
generality, we can assume that Hn = C2 for all n ∈ Z. Here, D = {(n, n + 1), (n + 1, n) : n ∈
Z}. By Theorem 4.1, there exist orthonormal bases {ξn,n+1, ξn+1,n}n∈Z and {ζn,n+1, ζn+1,n}n∈Z
of H with ξn,n+1, ζn+1,n ∈ Hn and ξn+1,n, ζn,n+1 ∈ Hn+1 such that

U =Xn∈Z |ξn,n+1ihζn,n+1| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n| =Xn∈Z |ξn−1,nihζn−1,n| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n|.

Theorem 5.1 Let (U,{Hn}n∈Z) be a one-dimensional quantum walk. For each k = 1, 2, 3, 4,
there exists a one-dimensional quantum walk in Ck that is unitary equivalent to (U,{Hn}n∈Z).
Proof. By Theorem 4.1, U can be written as

U =Xn∈Z |ξn−1,nihζn−1,n| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n|,

where {ξn,n+1, ξn+1,n}n∈Z and {ζn,n+1, ζn+1,n}n∈Z are orthonormal bases of H with ξn,n+1, ζn+1,n ∈
Hn and ξn+1,n, ζn,n+1 ∈ Hn+1.

First, we prove that (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is unitary equivalent to a quantum walk in C1. Let

Wn = |en

1ihξn,n+1| + |en

2ihξn,n−1|

for all n ∈ Z. It is easily seen that Wn is a unitary on Hn, with the result that W =Ln∈Z Wn
is a unitary on H that satisﬁes WHn = Hn. Moreover, from a direct calculation,

W UW ∗ = W  Xn∈Z |ξn−1,nihζn−1,n| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n|! W ∗

= Xn∈Z |en−1

1

ihW ζn−1,n| + |en+1

2

ihW ζn+1,n|.

Since W =Ln∈Z Wn is unitary, {W ζn−1,n, W ζn+1,n} is an orthonormal basis of Hn. Hence,
(W UW ∗,{Hn}n∈Z) is in C1, and we obtain that (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is unitary equivalent to a
quantum walk in C1.

9

Second, we prove that (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is unitary equivalent to a quantum walk in C2. Let

Wn = |en

1ihζn−1,n| + |en

2ihζn+1,n|

for all n ∈ Z. It is easily seen that Wn is a unitary on Hn, with the result that W =Ln∈Z Wn
is a unitary on H. Moreover, from a direct calculation, we have

W UW ∗ = W  Xn∈Z |ξn−1,nihζn−1,n| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n|! W ∗

= Xn∈Z |W ξn−1,nihen

1| + |W ξn+1,nihen
2|.

Since W =Ln∈Z Wn is unitary, {W ξn,n−1, W ξn,n+1} is an orthonormal basis of Hn. Hence,
(W UW ∗,{Hn}n∈Z) is in C2, and we obtain that (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is unitary equivalent to a
quantum walk in C2.

The proofs of the remaining parts are similar to these.

(cid:3)

As a corollary of the theorem, we have the following.

Corollary 5.2 Let (U,{Hn}n∈Z) be a translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk.
For each k = 1, 2, 3, 4, there exists a translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk in
Ck that is unitary equivalent to (U,{Hn}n∈Z).
Proof. By Theorem 4.1, U can be written as

U =Xn∈Z |ξn−1,nihζn−1,n| + |ξn+1,nihζn+1,n|,

where {ξn,n+1, ξn+1,n}n∈Z and {ζn,n+1, ζn+1,n}n∈Z are orthonormal bases of H with ξn,n+1, ζn+1,n ∈
Hn and ξn+1,n, ζn,n+1 ∈ Hn+1. Moreover, by translation invariance, we can assume that

ξn,n+1 = ξn−1,n,

ξn+1,n = ξn,n−1,

ζn,n+1 = ζn−1,n

and ζn+1,n = ζn,n−1

for all n ∈ Z. Therefore, in the proof of Theorem 5.1, Wn = Wn+1 for all n ∈ Z. Then, the
assertion of the corollary follows from Proposition 3.5.

6 One-dimensional Szegedy walk

In this section, we consider a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a one-dimensional quan-
tum walk to be a Szegedy walk. Let (U,{Hn}n∈Z) be a one-dimensional quantum walk.
Considering the unitary equivalence, we can assume Hn = C2 for all n ∈ Z without loss of
generality. By theorem 5.1, we can assume that U is represented as

U =Xn∈Z |en−1

1

ihζn−1,n| + |en+1

2

ihζn+1,n|,

where {ζn−1,n, ζn+1,n} is an orthonormal basis of Hn. Here,

1

Un−1,n = |en−1
Un+1,n = |en+1

2

bn

ihζn−1,n| = |n − 1ihn| ⊗(cid:20)an
ihζn+1,n| = |n + 1ihn| ⊗(cid:20) 0

0(cid:21) ,
cn dn(cid:21) ,

0

0

10

where the matrix

bn

cn dn(cid:21)
(cid:20)an

is unitary for all n ∈ Z.
If this is a Szegedy walk, there exists a shift operator S such that eiλSU is a direct sum
of traceless self-adjoint unitary operators for some λ ∈ R. By Lemma 4.3, S(ranUn,n+1) =
ranUn+1,n. Moreover, ranUn+1,n = Cen+1
1 = eiθnen+1
for some θn ∈ R. Consequently, S has the form
ihen

and ranUn,n+1 = Cen

1 . Therefore, Sen

1| + e−iθn|en

eiθn|en+1

1ihen+1

S =Xn∈Z

Then, SU is described as

SU =Mn∈Z(cid:20) e−iθncn

eiθn−1an eiθn−1bn(cid:21) .

e−iθndn

Let cn = eiµnrn and bn = eiνnrn with rn ≥ 0 and µn, νn ∈ R. Then,
ei(−θn+λ)dn
ei(θn−1+λ+νn)rn(cid:21) .

eiλSU =Mn∈Z(cid:20)ei(−θn+λ+µn)rn

ei(θn−1+λ)an

(3)

When rn 6= 0, the 2 × 2 matrices on the right hand side are traceless self-adjoint unitary if
and only if

−θn + λ + µn = 0 (mod π),

−θn + µn = θn−1 + νn + π

(mod 2π).

(4)

In the case rn = 0, let an = eiσn and dn = eiτn for some σn, τn ∈ R. Then the 2 × 2 matrices
on the right hand side in (3) are traceless self-adjoint unitary if and only if

θn−1 + λ + σn = θn − λ − τn

(mod 2π).

(5)

Hence, θn and λ satisfy conditions (4) and (5).

Conversely, if there exist θn and λ satisfying these conditions, the quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z)

is a Szegedy walk. Indeed, deﬁne a shift operator S by (2). Then, it is easily seen that eiλSU
is a direct sum of traceless self-adjoint unitary operators.

for λ and θn have a solution.

Therefore, (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is a Szegedy walk if and only if the above simultaneous equations
Now, we have the next theorem.

Theorem 6.1 Let (U,{Hn}n∈Z) be a one-dimensional quantum walk given by

1

Un−1,n = |en−1
Un+1,n = |en+1

2

ihζn−1,n| = |n − 1ihn| ⊗(cid:20)eiσnsn eiνnrn
0 (cid:21) ,
ihζn+1,n| = |n + 1ihn| ⊗(cid:20) 0
eiµnrn eiτnsn(cid:21) ,

0

0

(6)

where rn, sn ≥ 0 and µn, νn, σn, τn ∈ R, and let eiδn (δn ∈ R) be the determinant of

Un =(cid:20)eiσnsn eiνnrn
eiµnrn eiτnsn(cid:21) .

11

(7)

(8)

(U,{Hn}n∈Z) is a Szegedy walk if and only if the simultaneous equations

for all n ∈ Z and

θn − θn−1 − 2λ = δn

(mod 2π)

θn − λ = µn

(mod π) when rn 6= 0

with respect to λ and {θn}n∈Z have a solution.
Proof. Since eiδn is the determinant of Un,

δn = σn + τn

(if sn 6= 0) and δn = µn + νn + π (if rn 6= 0)

modulo 2π. Hence, equation (5) is calculated as

θn − θn−1 − 2λ = σn + τn = δn

(mod 2π).

On the other hand, the ﬁrst equation in (4) is equivalent to

−2θn + 2λ + 2µn = 0 (mod 2π),

with the result that

−θn + µn = θn − 2λ − µn
Therefore, the second equation in (4) is calculated as

(mod 2π).

θn − θn−1 − 2λ = µn + νn + π = δn

(mod 2π).

Equation (8) is equivalent to the ﬁrst equation in (4). Consequently, the simultaneous
equations (4) and (5) have a solution if and only if the simultaneous equations (7) and (8)
have a solution.
(cid:3)

Another necessary and suﬃcient condition for a one-dimensional quantum walk to be a

Szegedy walk is easier to check in some cases.

Corollary 6.2 Let {nk}k∈Λ ⊂ Z be numbers indexed by Λ ⊂ Z that satisfy rnk 6= 0 with
nk < nk+1. Suppose that Λ 6= ∅ and 0 ∈ Λ. A one-dimensional quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z)
given by (6) is a Szegedy walk if and only if there exists η ∈ R such that

µnk−1 + νnk +

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn = η(nk − nk−1)

(mod π)

for all k ∈ Λ with k − 1 ∈ Λ.
Proof. First, we assume that the simultaneous equations (7) and (8) have a solution {λ, θn}.
By (7)

θnk − θnk−1 =

nk−1

Xn=nk−1

θn+1 − θn = 2λ(nk − nk−1) +

nk−1

nk−1

Xn=nk−1

δn+1

= 2λ(nk − nk−1) + µnk + νnk +

Xn=nk−1+1

δn

(mod π).

(9)

12

Since θnk and θnk−1 satisfy (8),

µnk − µnk−1 = 2λ(nk − nk−1) + µnk + νnk +

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn

(mod π),

with the result that

µnk−1 + νnk +

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn = −2λ(nk − nk−1)

(mod π).

On the other hand, assume that there exists η ∈ R such that

µnk−1 + νnk +

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn = η(nk − nk−1)

(mod π)

(10)

for all k ∈ Λ with k − 1 ∈ Λ. Set λ = −η/2, θn0 = µn0 + λ, and
(n > n0)
(n < n0)

θn =(cid:26) θn−1 + 2λ + δn
θn+1 − 2λ − δn+1

,

inductively. Then, λ and θn satisfy (7). Moreover, if θnk−1 with nk−1 ≥ n0 satisﬁes (8), then
θnk also satisﬁes (8). Indeed, by (9) and (10),

θnk = θnk−1 + 2λ(nk − nk−1) + µnk + νnk +

= λ + µnk

(mod π).

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn = θnk−1 + µnk − µnk−1

Similarly, if θnk with nk ≤ n0 satisﬁes (8), then θnk−1 also satisﬁes (8). Indeed, by (9) and
(10),

θnk−1 = θnk − 2λ(nk − nk−1) − µnk − νnk −

= λ + µnk−1

(mod π).

nk−1

Xn=nk−1+1

δn = θnk − µnk + µnk−1

This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

As a special case of Corollary 6.2, we have the next corollary.

Corollary 6.3 A one-dimensional quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z) given by (6) with rn 6= 0 for
all n ∈ Z is a Szegedy walk if and only if there exists η ∈ R such that

µn−1 + νn = η

(mod π).

When rn = 0 for all n ∈ Z, a one-dimensional quantum walk is a Szegedy walk.

Corollary 6.4 A one-dimensional quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z) given by (6) with rn = 0 for
all n ∈ Z is a Szegedy walk.

13

Proof. Set λ = 0, θ0 = 0, and

(n ≥ 1)
(n ≤ −1)
inductively. This is a solution of simultaneous equations (7).

θn =(cid:26) θn−1 + δn
θn+1 − δn+1

,

(cid:3)

Using these corollaries, we prove that every translation-invariant one-dimensional quan-

tum walk is a Szegedy walk.

Corollary 6.5 A translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walk is a Szegedy walk.

Proof. If rn = 0 for all n ∈ Z, then it is a Szegedy walk by Corollary 6.4. If rn 6= 0 for
all n ∈ Z, then µn−1 + νn is a constant, because the quantum walk is translation invariant.
Therefore, it is a Szegedy walk by Corollary 6.3.

(cid:3)

Now, we consider some known models of one-dimensional quantum walks.

Corollary 6.6 A one-dimensional quantum walk (U,{Hn}n∈Z) with 2 coins [4, 10], i.e.,

0

Un−1,n =(cid:20)a+ eiν+r+
Un−1,n =(cid:20)a− eiν−r−

0 (cid:21) , Un+1,n =(cid:20)
(cid:21) , Un+1,n =(cid:20)

eiµ+r+ d+(cid:21)
eiµ−r− d−(cid:21)

(n ≥ 0)

(n < 0),

where r+, r− > 0, is a Szegedy walk if and only if

µ+ = µ− (mod π),

ν+ = ν− (mod π).

(11)

Proof. By Corollary 6.3, (U,{Hn}n∈Z) is a Szegedy walk if and only if there exists η ∈ R
such that

µ+ + ν+ = µ− + ν+ = µ− + ν− = η

(mod π).

This condition is equivalent to

µ+ = µ− (mod π),

ν+ = ν− (mod π).

(cid:3)

Using Corollary 6.3, we have following two corollaries.

Corollary 6.7 The following quantum walk, considered in [12],

Un−1,n =

is a Szegedy walk.

√2(cid:20)eiωn 1

0(cid:21) , Un+1,n =

Corollary 6.8 The following quantum walk, considered in [13, 14],

1

Un−1,n =

√2(cid:20)
is a Szegedy walk if and only if there exists η ∈ R such that
(mod π).

−ωn−1 + ωn = η

14

Using Theorem 6.1, we can prove that a quantum walk of the Shikano-Katsura model [17]

is a Szegedy walk.

Corollary 6.9 A quantum walk of the Shikano-Katsura model, i.e.,

Un−1,n =

1

√2(cid:20)cos(2παn) − sin(2παn)

0

(cid:21) , Un+1,n =

1

√2(cid:20)

0

sin(2παn) cos(2παn)(cid:21)

0

is a Szegedy walk for any α ∈ R.
Proof. By the deﬁnition of U, µn and δn are 0 or π for all n ∈ Z. Set λ = 0, θ0 = 0, and

θn =(cid:26) θn−1 + δn
θn+1 − δn+1

(n ≥ 1)
(n ≤ −1)

,

inductively. This is a solution of (7) and (8).
