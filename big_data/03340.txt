THUE’S INEQUALITIES AND THE

HYPERGEOMETRIC METHOD

SHABNAM AKHTARI, N. SARADHA, AND DIVYUM SHARMA

Abstract. Following a method originally due to Siegel, we es-
tablish upper bounds for the number of primitive integer solutions
to inequalities of the shape 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h, where F (x, y) =
(αx + βy)r − (γx + δy)r ∈ Z[x, y], α, β, γ and δ are algebraic
constants with αδ − βγ 6= 0, and r ≥ 3 and h are integers. As an
important application, we pay special attention to binomial Thue’s
inequaities |axr − by r| ≤ c. The proofs are based on the hyperge-
ometric method of Thue and Siegel and its reﬁnement by Evertse.

1. Introduction and statements of the results

As a consequence of his improvement of Liouville’s theorem on ap-
proximation of algebraic numbers by rationals, Thue [25] proved that if
F (x, y) is a binary form with integer coeﬃcients, having at least three
pairwise non-proportional linear factors in its factorization over C, and
h is a non-zero integer then the Diophantine equation

F (x, y) = h

has only a ﬁnite number of integer solutions. Such equations are called
Thue equations, and inequalities of the shape
0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h

(1)

are called Thue inequalities.

Thue used Pad´e approximation to binomial functions to study some
families of Thue equations (see for example [26]). Later Siegel [22]
identiﬁed the approximating polynomials in Thue’s method as hyper-
geometric polynomials. The hypergeometric method of Thue and Siegel
applies to a special family of Thue equations and inequalities ( see, for
example, [5], [21] and [27]).

Deﬁnition 1.1. A binary form F (x, y) ∈ Z[x, y] is called diagonaliz-
able if it can be written as

F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r − (γx + δy)r,

where the constants α, β, γ and δ satisfy

j = αδ − βγ 6= 0.

(2)

(3)

Then

If F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r − (γx + δy)r ∈ Z[x, y] is diagonalizable then

(αx + βy)(γx + δy) = χ(Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2)

(4)
for some A, B, C ∈ Z and a constant χ. Let

D = D(F ) = B2 − 4AC.

j2 = χ2D.

Therefore D(F ) 6= 0 for a diagonalizable form F (x, y). Let ∆ be the
discriminant of F (x, y).
Deﬁnition 1.2. Let (x, y) ∈ Z2 satisfy the equation F (x, y) = h (or
the inequality 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h). We call (x, y) a primitive solution if
gcd(x, y) = 1.

From now on, for an integer h and a binary form F (x, y) ∈ Z[x, y],
let NF (h) denote the number of primitive solutions to the inequality
0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h. For YL ∈ R+, let NF (h; YL) denote the number of
primitive solutions of 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h with y ≥ YL. Put
(5)

∆′ =

|∆|

2r2−rrrh2r−2 ,

where ∆ is the discriminant of F (x, y).

We will follow some ideas of Siegel in [21] to prove several results on
diagonalizable Thue’s inequality. In Section 2 we will state the main
theorem in [21] and compare it with one of our main theorems.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose F (x, y) is a diagonalizable form with degree
r ≥ 6 and discriminant ∆. Assume that

One interesting feature of Theorem 1.2 is that it shows explicitly
how by increasing the range for the positive integer h (by increasing
the value of m and therefore decreasing the value of α2), we are required
to count more solutions. The upper bound on the number of solutions
increases linearly in terms of m while the range of h increases double
exponentially in m − 4, provided that h ≪ |∆|

In the above theorems and throughout this manuscript, we deem

(x, y) and (−x,−y) as one solution.
Our assumption r ≥ 5 is to simplify the proofs and reduce the
amount of computations. One can use similar techniques for the di-
agonalizable forms of degree r = 3, 4. However, these special and
important cases have been studied before. We refer the reader to
[3, 20, 28, 29] for cubic inequalities and to [2], in particular its Theorem
1.4, for quartic inequalities. Also Wakabayashi has studied a family of
parametric quartic Thue’s inequalities in [30, 31].

4

SHABNAM AKHTARI, N. SARADHA, AND DIVYUM SHARMA

There have been several results on the number of solutions to gen-
eral Thue’s inequalities 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h which assert that if h is
small in comparison with a function of |∆(F )| then upper bounds NF ,
independent of h, could be established (see for example [1, 19, 15]). In
particular, the results in [1] and [15] imply that such upper bounds can
be obtained if h < |∆|
4(r−1) . Our method allows us to improve these
upper bounds for diagonalizable Thue’s inequalities. Moreover, we are
able to improve the dependency of h on the discriminant of the binary
form in the inequality.

The following is an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.2.

Corollary 1.4. Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form of degree r ≥ 5,

NF (h) ≤ 5 +& log (1/ǫ)

log(r − 1)'! r

where the symbol ⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal
to the real number x.

A nice feature of diagonalizable forms is that they can adopt a reduc-
tion theory based on the classical reduction for quadratic forms. We
will deﬁne reduced diagonalizable forms in Section 4. We will prove
the following theorems on the number of large solutions to Thue in-
equalities 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h, without any assumption on the size of
h.

The most interesting family of diagonalizable forms are binomial
forms, the forms of the shape axr − byr. Many mathematicians, in-
cluding Thue [26], Siegel [22], Domar [12], Evertse [13], Bennett and
de Weger [7], studied the equation axr − byr = h. In a breakthrough

6

SHABNAM AKHTARI, N. SARADHA, AND DIVYUM SHARMA

work [8], Bennett used a sophisticated combination of the hypergeo-
metric method with Chebyshev-like estimates for primes in arithmetic
progressions to show that the equation

axr − byr = 1,

with a and b positive, has at most one solution in positive integers x, y.
This is a sharp result, as the equation

(a + 1)xr − ayr = 1

has precisely one solution (1, 1) in positive integers, for every positive
integer a. In [22], Siegel showed that the equation 0 < |axr − byr| ≤ c
has at most one primitive solution in positive integers x and y if

Our main results can be directly applied to binomial Thue’s inequalities
to slightly improve the above result of Siegel’s, by extending the range
of c with resect to a and b. For example, Corollary 1.3 implies the
following.
Theorem 1.8. Let a, b and c and r ≥ 5 be positive integers. Assume
that

In [18], using the theory of linear forms in logarithms, Mignotte
obtained eﬀective results for the size of the solutions of binomial Thue’s
inequality. Some computational results on binomial Thue equations
can be found in [6].

The outline of this manuscript is as follows. In Section 2 we compare
Siegel’s main theorem in [21] to our Theorem 1.2.
In Section 3 we
recall some known facts that are going to be used in our proofs. In
Section 4 we introduce reduced diagonalizable forms and some of their
properties. In Section 5 we will establish some important gap principles
which will be a major part of our proofs. Another essential ingredient
in establishing our results is the use of the hypergeometric method
together with the construction of some sequences of algebraic numbers.
Our proofs are based on the work of Siegel in [23] and its improvements
for cubic forms in papers of Evertse [14] and Bennett [9]. These analytic

tools and their adjustments are developed in Sections 6, 7 and 8. In
the remaining ﬁnal sections we complete our proofs.

2. Siegel’s Theorem on diagonalizable forms

In [23] Siegel proved the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1 (Siegel). Assume that F (x, y) is a diagonalizable form
of degree r and with discriminant ∆. Suppose that

∆′ >(cid:0)r4h(cid:1)clr2−l

(13)
where r ≥ 6 − l, l = 1, 2, 3,

if D > 0 and F is deﬁnite.



In particular, if D < 0 and l = 1, then NF (h) ≤ 2r provided

|∆| > 2r2−rr183.6rh47.6r−2.

Notice that in Theorem 1.1, the lower bound for ∆′ is asymptotic to

r13rh4r. In Theorem 1.2,

α1 ∼

7
rm−4 and α2 ∼

1
rm−4 .

To compare Theorem 1.2 with Theorem 2.1, we take m = 2l with
l = 2, 3. Then the bounds for NF (h) in (15) and (9) coincide. Corre-
sponding to α1 and α2 in (7), we have 4clr2−l and clr2−l, respectively
in (13). Table 1 provides the values of these quantities.

Remark. In [23], Siegel considered the form

F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r + (γx + δy)r.

Such a form can be represented as in (2). Let ω be an r-th root of −1.
Then

F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r − (γ′x + δ′y)r,

where γ′ = ωγ and δ′ = ωδ. Hence there is no loss of generality in
assuming that F (x, y) is of the form (2).

3. Preliminaries

In this section we survey several facts about diagonalizable forms.
Most of these facts can be found in [23, p.148-149]. Let (x, y) be a
generic primitive solution of (1). If f is any function of (x, y), then we
write

f = f (x, y).

While enumerating the solutions of (1) as (x0, y0), (x1, y1), . . ., we
denote by

Let

fi = f (xi, yi), i ≥ 0.

u = αx + βy, v = γx + δy, ξ = ur and η = vr.

Then F (x, y) = ξ − η = ur − vr. For any solution (x, y), we have
(u(x, y), v(x, y)) 6= (0, 0) as we assumed j 6= 0 in (3). The Hessian H
and the Jacobian P of F are deﬁned as

and

H = HF (x, y) = FxxFyy − F 2

xy

respectively. It can be seen that

P = PF (x, y) = FxHy − FyHx,

Clearly if the coeﬃcients of F are all integers then ∆ is an integer and
the coeﬃcients of H and P are also integers. From (4), we have

χr ∈ Q.

Now from (18) we have

r3(r − 1)2(r − 2)χrD(Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2)r−3√D(ξ + η) ∈ Z[x, y].
Thus we get the following lemma.

Now we will consider the number ﬁeld Q(√D). If Q(√D) = Q then
both ξ = (αx + βy)r and η = (γx + δy)r have rational coeﬃcients.
Furthermore, if Q(√D) = Q, after a change of variable, we may assume
If Q(√D) 6= Q, the corresponding coeﬃcients of the

forms ξ and −η are conjugates in Q(√D) by (23). Therefore by (3),
we conclude that if Q(√D) 6= Q, then α 6= 0 and γ 6= 0. We may write

Let O be the ring of integers in Q(√D).
Lemma 3.2. All the coeﬃcients of r(r− 1)√Dξ and r(r − 1)√Dη are

Proof. We have

ξη = (uv)r = (αx + βy)r(γx + δy)r = χr(AX 2 + Bxy + Cy2)r

and therefore

r2(r − 1)2Dξη = L(Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2)r ∈ Z[x, y].

(25)
Since ξ − η ∈ Z[x, y] and
D(ξ − η)2 + r2(r − 1)2Dξη!1/2

we conclude that all of the coeﬃcients of r(r−1)√Dξ and r(r−1)√Dη

4. Reduced Forms

We call two binary forms F1(x, y) and F2(x, y) equivalent if they are
equivalent under GL(2, Z) action, i.e., if there exists an integer matrix

λ =(cid:18)a b
c d(cid:19)

such that ad − bc = ±1 and

F1(ax + by, cx + dy) = F2(x, y).

Then we write

Notice that if

F2 = F1oλ.

F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r − (γx + δy)r

then every equivalent form will be of the shape
G(x, y) = ((aα + cβ)x + (bα + dβ)y)r − ((aγ + cδ)x + (bγ + dδ)y)r ,
for some (cid:18)a b
c d(cid:19) ∈ GL(2, Z). Thus a diagonalizable form remains
diagonalizable under GL(2, Z)-action. Further, the number of primitive
solutions of 0 < |F1(x, y)| ≤ h remains unaltered for any equivalent
form F1 of F .
Recall that a deﬁnite quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 is called

reduced if C ≥ A ≥ |B|.

12

SHABNAM AKHTARI, N. SARADHA, AND DIVYUM SHARMA

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let F (x, y) = (αx + βy)r − (γx + δy)r ∈ Z[x, y] be a
diagonalizable form with

(αx + βy)(γx + δy) = χ(Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2)

(26)
and A, B, C ∈ Z and a constant χ. If D = B2 − 4AC < 0, we call
F (x, y) reduced if the quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 is reduced.

It is a well-known fact that every deﬁnite quadratic form is equivalent
to a reduced form. Therefore, if D < 0 then F (x, y) is clearly equivalent
to a reduced form.

Lemma 4.1. Let F (x, y) be a reduced diagonalizable form with D < 0.
If (x, y) is a solution of 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h with y 6= 0, then

|u(x, y)| = |v(x, y)| ≥ |χ|1/2|y||3D|1/4

Proof. We have

Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 = y2(At2 + Bt + C),

where t = x/y. Then the polynomial At2 + Bt + C assumes a minimum
equal to 4AC−B2
at t = −B
2A . Since Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 is reduced, we have

Deﬁnition 5.2. We denote by S the set of all solutions of 0 < |F (x, y| ≤
h and by Sω the set of all solutions of 0 < |F (x, y| ≤ h that are related
to ω.

Clearly Sω ⊆ S and S = ∪Sω, as ω ranges over all r-th roots of unity.
Lemma 5.1. Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form and (x0, y0) a solu-
tion to the inequality 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h with the largest value ζ0 of ζ,
where ζ and Z are deﬁned in (32) and (31). Then for every integer
pair (x, y) 6= (x0, y0) satisfying 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h, we have
(i) Z(x, y) ≥ |j|1/2

(iii) ζ(x, y) < 2−ν if ζ0 ≥ 1 and |j| > 21+ν/rh2/r for ν ∈ R.
Proof. Let (x1, y1) 6= (x0, y0) be a solution of (1). Then

u0v1 − u1v0 = (αδ − βγ)(x0y1 − x1y0) = j(x0y1 − x1y0) 6= 0

by (3). We conclude that

(34)

|j| ≤ |u0v1| + |u1v0| ≤ 2Z0Z1.

Hence, if |j| > 21+ν/rh2/r, we get

ζ1 ≤ 2rh2|j|−r < 2−ν.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.3. We denote the solution to the inequality 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤
h for which ζ is the largest by (x0, y0). We denote the largest value of
ζ by ζ0.

Remark. By Lemma 5.1, if |j| > 2h2/r and the integer pair (x, y) 6=
(x0, y0) satisﬁes 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h, then ζ(x, y) < 1.
The next three results are for forms with D > 0.

Lemma 5.2. Let F be a deﬁnite diagonalizable form with D > 0. Then
for any (x, y) ∈ R2 \ (0, 0), we have ζ(x, y) ≥ 1, where the function ζ
is deﬁned in (32).
Proof. Since F (x, y) = (−1)rF (−x,−y), we conclude that the degree
r is even. Further, since j 6= 0, forms of the type axr or byr with
a, b ∈ Z are excluded. It follows from the deﬁnition of ζ in (32) that if
αr and γr are of opposite signs, then ζ(x, y) ≥ 1 for every (x, y) ∈ R2.
We claim that for every deﬁnite diagonalizable form F (x, y), αr and
γr have opposite signs. Assume, in contrary, that αr and γr are either

THUE’S INEQUALITIES AND THE HYPERGEOMETRIC METHOD

15

both positive or both negative. Recall that (see (24) and its following
lines)

F (x, y) = αr(x + β1y)r − γr(x + δ1y)r

with αγ 6= 0 and αr, γr, β1, δ1 ∈ Q(√D) ⊆ R. Then we have

F (−β1, 1) = −γr(−β1 + δ1)r

and

F (−δ1, 1) = αr(−δ1 + β1)r.

Since −β1 + δ1 ∈ R and r is even, we conclude that F (−β1, 1) and
F (−δ1, 1) have opposite signs, which is a contradiction with the form F
being deﬁnite. Notice that since (−β1, 1) 6= (0, 0) and (−δ1, 1) 6= (0, 0),
the above argument also shows that γr 6= 0 and αr 6= 0.

(cid:3)

As a direct consequence of Lemmas 5.1(iii) and 5.2 we get

Corollary 5.3. Let F (x, y) be a deﬁnite diagonalizable form with D >
0 and |j| > 2h2/r. Then the inequality 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h has at most
one solution.

Lemma 5.4. Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form with D > 0. Then
all solutions of 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h with ζ < 1 are related to one or two
r-th roots of unity when r is odd or r even, respectively.

Proof. Let u = α(x + β1y) and v = γ(x + δ1y) so that

F (x, y) = ur(x, y) − vr(x, y),

where αγ 6= 0 and αr, γr, β1, δ1 ∈ Q(√D). It follows from the deﬁnition
of ζ in (32) that if r is even and αr and γr are of opposite signs,
then ζ(x, y) ≥ 1 for every (x, y) ∈ R2 (in this case F (x, y) will be a
deﬁnite form, see Lemma 5.2 and its proof). Therefore we will assume
that either r is odd or the real numbers αr and γr have the same
sign. Without loss of generality, let us assume that αr and γr are
both positive if r is even (otherwise we can replace the form F (x, y)
by −F (x, y)). Let α′ and γ′ be ﬁxed real r-th roots of αr and γr,
respectively. Then we have α
γ ′ for a ﬁxed r-th root of unity ω.
Therefore, for (x, y) ∈ R2,

γ = ω α′

u(x, y)
v(x, y)

= ωR(x, y),

with R(x, y) ∈ R. We claim that all the solutions of 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h
with ζ < 1 are related to ω if r is odd and all the solutions of 0 <
|F (x, y)| ≤ h with ζ < 1 are related to ω or −ω if r is even.

Suppose (x, y) ∈ Z2 satisﬁes 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h and ζ(x, y) < 1.

is a polynomial of degree d, deﬁne

P ∗(x, y) = adxd + . . . + a1xyd−1 + a0yd = xdP (y/x).

Here z is a complex variable and α, β and γ are complex constants. If
α or β is a non-positive integer and m is the smallest integer such that

α(α + 1)· · · (α + m)β(β + 1)· · · (β + m) = 0,

then F (α, β, γ, z) is a polynomial in z of degree m. Furthermore, if γ
is a non-positive integer, we will assume that at least one of α and β
is also a non-positive integer, smaller than γ.

We note that F (α, β, γ, z) converges for |z| < 1. By a result of
Gauss, if α, β and γ are real with γ > α + β and γ, γ − α and γ − β are
not non-positive integers, then F (α, β, γ, z) converges for z = 1 and we

(48)

(k + 1)(γ + k)ak+1 = (α + k)(β + k)ak for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Therefore if γ > 0, all the coeﬃcients of F (z) are determined by a0.
Hence the solution space of (42) is one-dimensional. Both An,g(1 − z)
and Cn,g(z) satisfy (42) with α = −1/r − n + g, β = −n, γ = 1 − 1

Hence they are linearly dependent. On equating the coeﬃcients of zn

SHABNAM AKHTARI, N. SARADHA, AND DIVYUM SHARMA

Since n ≥ 1 and g ∈ {0, 1}, γ = −2n + g is a negative integer. By (48),
if F (z) = P∞
m=0 amzm is a solution to (42), then since a0 and a2n−g+1
may vary independently, the solution space of (42) is two-dimensional.
Therefore, there are constants c1, c2 and c3, not all zero, such that

c1An,g(z) + c2(1 − z)1/rBn,g(z) + c3z2n+1−gGn,g(z) = 0.

Letting z = 0, since An,g(0) = Bn,g(0) 6= 0, we ﬁnd that c1 = −c2 6= 0.
We may thus assume c1 = 1. Substituting z = 1 in the above identity
we get c3 = − An,g (1)

Gn,g (1) , whence we may take

Fn,g(z) = An,g(1)Gn,g(1)−1Gn,g(z).

In order to complete the proof of part (i), note that, by (41), we have

An,g(1)Gn,g(1)−1 =(cid:18)n − 1/r
n (cid:1)(cid:0)n−g+1/r
n+1−g (cid:1)
(cid:0)2n+1−g

= (cid:0)n−1/r

Now we prove (iii). By (44),

n

An,0(z)Bn+I,1(z) − An+I,1(z)Bn,0(z) = z2n+I Pn,I(z),

where Pn,I(z) is a power series. However, the left hand side of the
above identity is a polynomial of degree at most 2n + I, and so Pn,I
must be a constant. Letting z = 1, we obtain that

Pn,I(1) =(cid:18)n − 1/r

n (cid:19)(cid:18)n + I + 1/r − 1

n − 1

(cid:19)−(cid:18)n + I − 1/r

n

(cid:19)(cid:18)n + 1/r

n (cid:19) 6= 0.

Therefore,

An,0(z)Bn+I,1(z) − An+I,1(z)Bn,0(z) = 0

if and only if z = 0.

Finally we prove (iv). From the deﬁnition of An,g and Bn,g it suﬃces

to prove that

m (cid:19)(r2√D)m ∈ O
(cid:18)a/r

for every a, m ∈ Z with m ≥ 0. This clearly holds for m = 0. Let
m ≥ 1. The assertion follows if we show that for each prime p the
number

t(m) :=(cid:18)a/r

m (cid:19)(r)2m = a(a − r) . . . (a − r(m − 1))rm/m!

we get

a − rx ≡ 0

(mod pj),

ordp(a(a − r) . . . (a − r(m − 1)) ≥

7. Construction of some Algebraic Numbers

Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form given in (2) and D be the dis-
criminant of the associated quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 given
in (4). We will work with the quadratic number ﬁeld Q(√D) and its
ring of integers O. We use the approximating polynomials An,g(z) and
Bn,g(z) in Section 6 to construct some complex sequences. Suppose
that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two distinct solutions to the inequality
0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h that are related to a ﬁxed root of unity. Let Z be
the function deﬁned in (31). We deﬁne

and

(X1, Y1) =((u1, v1) if Z1 = |u1|

(v1, u1) otherwise

(X2, Y2) =((u2, v2) if (X1, Y1) = (u1, v1)

We will show that Λn,g is either an integer in Q(√D) or an r-th root
of such an integer. The same assertion holds for ˜Λn,g. If Σn,g 6= 0, we
can get a lower bound for |Λn,g ˜Λn,g|. We shall use Lemma 6.1 to get
an upper bound also. As a direct consequence of Lemmas 3.2 and 6.1
(iv), we get the following result.

Lemma 7.1. For any pair of integers (x, y) satisfying 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤
h, we have

are in O.
Lemma 7.2. If Σn,g 6= 0, then we have

|Λn,g ˜Λn,g| ≥ 4−(g/r+1−g).

Note. When D < 0, we have |Λn,g| = |˜Λn,g| as Λn,g and ˜Λn,g are
complex conjugates.

Proof. Note that An,g is of degree n and Bn,g is of degree n − g. We
re-write

Λn,g =

Lemma 7.4. If n ∈ N and I ∈ {0, 1}, then at most one of

{Σn,0, Σn+I,1}

can vanish.
Proof. Let n be a positive integer and I ∈ {0, 1} . Following an argu-
ment of Bennett [9], we deﬁne the matrix M:

M =


An,0(z1) An+I,1(z1) Y1/X1
An,0(z1) An+I,1(z1) Y1/X1
Bn,0(z1) Bn+I,1(z1) Y2/X2


 .

The determinant of M is zero because it has two identical rows. Ex-
panding along the ﬁrst row, we ﬁnd that

An,0(z1)Σn+I,1 − An+I,1(z1)Σn,0 +
+

(An,0(z1)Bn+I,1(z1) − An+I,1(z1)Bn,0(z1))

vanishes and hence if Σn,0 = Σn+I,1 = 0, then

contradicting part (iii) of Lemma 6.1.

8. An Auxiliary Lemma

We devote this section to a lemma that will be used later in combina-
tion with our gap principle to complete the proof of our main theorems.
We will repeatedly appeal to the induction procedure that is introduced
in the proof of Lemma 8.1 in proving our main theorems in later sec-
tions. The ideas used in the proof are originally due to Evertse in [14],
where he proved upper bounds for the number of solutions to cubic
Thue equations.

The computational steps in the proof are veriﬁed by symbolic com-
putation in MATHEMATICA. A ﬁle containing these steps is available
at http://www.math.tifr.res.in/∼saradha/hypergeometric.txt.
Lemma 8.1. Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form of degree r ≥ 5. Let
ω be a ﬁxed r-th root of unity, Sω be the set of all primitive solutions to
0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h that are related to ω and S′
ω be as in (39). Assume
|S′
ω| = k ≥ 3. Further, suppose that

(iv) B1 × i8 ≥ rB4.

Then if Σn,g 6= 0, (62) holds.
To complete the proof we use induction on n. First we verify the
basis of induction by implementing MATHEMATICA. By (57), P [r −
1, 1, 0,−1, 1] holds. Fix (n, g) = (1, 0). Suppose Σ1,0 6= 0. We check
that (i) − (iv) are valid with a1 = r − 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 0, a4 = −1 and
a5 = 1. Hence P [2r − 1, 7, (3r + 2)/(r − 2), (r + 2)/(r − 2), 3] holds, i.e.
(55) is valid with n = 1.
If Σ1,0 = 0, then by Lemma 7.4, both Σ1,1 and Σ2,1 are non-zero.
Fix (n, g) = (1, 1). We verify that (i) − (iv) are valid with a1 = r − 1,
a2 = 1, a3 = 0, a4 = −1 and a5 = 1. Hence P [r, 7, (5r + 2)/(r −
2), (2r + 2)/(r − 2), 2] holds. Now we ﬁx (n, g) = (2, 1) and check
that (i) − (iv) are valid with a1 = r, a2 = 7, a3 = (5r + 2)/(r − 2),
a4 = (2r + 2)/(r − 2) and a5 = 2 since r ≥ 5 and k ≥ 3. Thus
P [2r, 8, (8r + 2)/(r − 2), (3r + 2)/(r − 2), 4] holds. Hence (55) is valid
for n = 1 provided

(66)

Zk−1

2r5r/(r−2)|j|2r/(r−2)h ≥ 1.

By (58) with k replaced by k − 1 and (56) with i = 1, this is valid if
(67)
|j| ≥ 2(R(k)+r−3)/(R(k)−2r−1)r5r/(R(k)−2r−1)h(2R(k)+r2−3r)/(r(R(k)−2r−1)).
The above inequality holds by (53).

Now we proceed by assuming that P [(n+1)r−1, n+6, (3nr +2)/(r−
2), (nr + 2)/(r− 2), 2n + 1] holds for some n ≥ 1. We will show that the
property holds for n + 1. Fix (n, g) = (n + 1, 0). Suppose Σn+1,0 6= 0.
We verify that (i)− (iv) are valid. Hence the property follows for n + 1.
Next we suppose that Σn+1,0 = 0. Then by Lemma 7.4 both Σn+1,1
and Σn+2,1 are non-zero. First ﬁx (n, g) = (n + 1, 1) and check that
(i)−(iv) are valid so that P [(n+1)r, n+7, ((3n+5)r +2)/(r−2), (r(n+
2) + 2)/(r − 2), 2n + 2] holds.

Now ﬁx (n, g) = (n + 2, 1). Proceeding as above, we obtain that
P [(n + 2)r, n + 8, ((3n + 8)r + 2)/(r − 2), ((n + 3)r + 2)/(r − 2), 2n + 4]
holds. Thus property P holds for n + 1 by (66). This completes the
induction.

9. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form given in (2).

If F (x, y) is a
deﬁnite form, (16) and Corollary 5.3 imply Theorem 1.2. Let ω be an

THUE’S INEQUALITIES AND THE HYPERGEOMETRIC METHOD

33

r-th root of unity and Sω be the set of all solutions of the inequality
0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h that are related to ω. Let k = |S′
ω| and m ≥ 3 be
the integer in the statement of Theorem 1.2 that satisﬁes (7) and (8).
We will show that k ≤ m − 1. Assume k ≥ m. Then by (7), we have
(68)

∆′ ≥ rA1hA2

where

(69)

A1 =

7r2(r − 1)

(r − 1)k−1 − 2r − 1

and A2 =

(r − 1)(r2 + r + 2)
(r − 1)k−1 − 2r − 1

.

Therefore, by (16), we ﬁnd that the inequality (53) holds. By Lemma
8.1 and (58) for every integer n ≥ 1, we have
(70)

C1 = (((n + 1)r − 1)(R(k) − 1) − (nr + 2))/(r − 2),

C2 = (((n + 1)r − 1)(R(k) − 1) + (n + 6)(r − 2))/(r − 2),

C3 = (3nr + 2)/(r − 2)

C4 = 2n + 1 + ((n + 1)r − 1)(2R(k) − r)/(r2 − 2r).

By the choices of i7, i8 in (53), the right hand side of (70) goes to
inﬁnity as n → ∞. This is a contradiction. We conclude that

k ≤ m − 1 and hence |Sω| ≤ m.

Since we have r diﬀerent choices for ω, and if D > 0, Lemma 5.4
(cid:3)

implies one or two possible choices for ω, our proof is complete.

10. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Let F (x, y) be a diagonalizable form given in (2). As in Deﬁnition
5.3, let (x0, y0) be the solution with the largest ζ value ζ0. As before,
let S be the set of all solutions to the inequality 0 < |F (x, y)| ≤ h and
ω a ﬁxed r-th root of unity. We deﬁne S′′
ω to be the set of solutions in
S \ {(x0, y0)} that are related to ω. In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we
will show that |S′′
ω| ≤ 2. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem
1.2.
ω have ζ < 1. Also

By Lemma 5.1, since |j| > 2h2/r, all solutions in S′′

|j| ≥ 2(r+3)(r−2)/(r2−5r−2)r10r/(r2−5r−2)h2(3r−1)(r−2)/(r(r2 −5r−2)).

We implement the induction procedure given in Section 8 with the
above values of B1 − B4 and a1 − a5 as already given in the procedure.
The conditions (i)–(iv) are satisﬁed at every stage of the induction.
Further, by (58) with k = 2 and using (71) and (77), it follows that
(66) is true. Hence we get that the property P [(n+1)r−1, n+6, (3nr +
2)/(r − 2), (nr + 2)/(r − 2), 2n + 1] is valid for any n ≥ 1. Thus we
have

By (72), (73) and (74), the right hand side of the inequality (78) tends
to inﬁnity as n approaches inﬁnity. This is a contradiction. Therefore,
we conclude that for every given ω,
|S′′
ω| ≤ 2.

Counting the solution (x0, y0) (See Deﬁnition 5.3), by Lemma 5.4 and
the fact that there are generally r choices for ω, our proof is complete.

11. On Large solutions; proofs of Theorems 1.5 and 1.6

Proof of Theorem 1.5. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem
1.2. We will use the proof of Lemma 8.1. Let ω be a ﬁxed r-th root of
unity. Suppose that there are k solutions (xi, yi), i = 1, . . . , k, that are
related to ω with yi ≥ YL for all i. Also assume that the solutions are
indexed such that ζi+1 ≤ ζi. Let m be the integer in the statement of
Theorem 1.5. We will show that k ≤ m. Let us assume

m < k.

Then (11) implies that

the above values A1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and a1 − a5 as already given in the
procedure. The conditions (v)–(vii) are satisﬁed at every stage of the
induction. Hence (61) is valid. Further by the assumptions on k and
r, (66) is valid by (58) with k replaced by k − 1, (80) and (79), thereby
completing the induction. Similarly from (55), we conclude that for

Let a and b be positive integers. The discriminant ∆ of the form

F (x, y) = axr − byr is equal to

(−1)(r−1)(r+2)/2rr (ab)r−1 .

For even degree r, notice that if (x, y) is a solution to the inequality
0 < |axr − byr| ≤ c, so is (−x, y). Also if (x, y) is related to ω then
(−x, y) is related to −ω. In Theorem 1.8, we are interested in positive
solutions x and y, therefore we only need to count the number of solu-
tions related to one r-th root of unity in this case (see Lemma 5.4 and
its proof).

The above observations and Corollary 1.3 imply Theorem 1.8.

13. Diagonalizable Thue equations, proof of Theorem 1.7

Proposition 13.1. Let Sr be the set of diagonalizable binary forms
F (x, y) ∈ Z[x, y] of degree r ≥ 3. Let N be an upper bound for the
number of solutions of Thue equations

as F varies over the elements of Sr. Then for h ∈ N and G(x, y) ∈ Sr,
the equation

|F (x, y)| = 1

has at most

|G(x, y)| = h

N rω(h)

primitive solutions, where ω(h) is the number of prime divisors of h.

Proof. This is essentially a special case of Bombieri and Schmidt’s re-
sult in [10], where they showed that if Nn is an upper bound for the
number of solutions to the equations |F (x, y)| = 1, as F (x, y) varies
over irreducible binary forms of degree n with integer coeﬃcients then
Nnnω(h) is an upper bound for the number of primitive solutions to
|F (x, y)| = h. Bombieri and Schmidt proved this fact by reducing a
given Thue equation |F (x, y)| = h modulo every prime factor of the
integer h. This reduction is explained in the proof of Lemma 7 of [10],
where the form F (x, y) of degree n is reduced to some other binary

THUE’S INEQUALITIES AND THE HYPERGEOMETRIC METHOD

39

forms of degree n. These reduced forms are obtained through the ac-
tion of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries and non-zero discriminant
on the binary form F (x, y). We refer the reader to [10] and [24] for
more details. It is clear (see Section 4) that under the action of 2 × 2
matrices a diagonalizable form will be reduced to other diagonalizable
forms.
(cid:3)

Upper bounds N for the number of solutions of diagonalizable Thue
equations |F (x, y)| = 1 are obtained in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, where F
ranges over diagonalizable forms of degree r, provided that the discrim-
inant of F is large in terms of r. In particular, Corollary 1.3, together
with Proposition 13.1, implies Theorem 1.7.
