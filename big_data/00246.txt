Polynomial ideals from a nonlinear

viewpoint

Geraldo Botelho∗ and Ewerton R. Torres†

Abstract

Classes of homogeneous polynomials between Banach spaces have been studied
in the last three decades from the perspective of the so-called ideal property: if a
polynomial P belongs to a class Q, then the composition u ◦ P ◦ v of P with linear
operators u and v belongs to Q as well. In an attempt to explore the nonlinearity of
the subject in a more consistent way, and taking into account recent results in the
ﬁeld, in this paper we propose the study of classes of homogeneous polynomials that
are stable under the composition with homogeneous polynomials. Some important
classes justify the study of the intermediate concept of classes of polynomials Q such
that if P belongs to Q, u is a linear operator and Q is a homogeneous polynomial,
then u ◦ P ◦ Q belongs to Q.

Introduction and background

In 1983, A. Pietsch [55] started the study of ideals of multilinear operators between Banach
spaces as an extension of the successful theory of ideals of linear operators (operator
ideals). Naturally enough, ideals of homogeneous polynomials between Banach spaces
begun to be studied soon afterwards. It is diﬃcult to point out the ﬁrst occurrence of the
concept of polynomial ideals, but the idea goes back at least to 1984 with the thesis [17]
of H.-A. Braunss. In Floret [40, 1.9] one can ﬁnd a digression on the appearance of the
concept of polynomial ideals.

For the last three decades, a huge amount of work has been done on polynomial ide-
als. The theory has been developed pari passu with the theory of ideals of multilinear
operators (multi-ideals), and connections have been established with other topics, such
as (just a few references are given):
inﬁnite dimensional holomorphy [8, 21, 43], topo-
logical tensor products [23, 30, 42], ultrapower stability [40, 41], quantum information
theory [48, 53], Dirichlet series [32, 34], integral formulas/stable measures [22], coher-
ence/compatibility [20, 50], Bishop-Phelps-Bollob´as-Lindenstrauss circle of ideas [2, 24],
unconditional bases [23, 33], interpolation theory [4, 18, 35], classical inequalities (Hardy–
Littlewood, Bohnenblust–Hille, Blei) [3, 4, 5, 35, 59], summability properties [1, 47, 51],

Roughly speaking, a polynomial ideal is a class Q of homogeneous polynomials between
Banach spaces such that if a polynomial P belongs to Q and u and v are linear operators
with compatible domains, then the composition u ◦ P ◦ v belongs to Q as well. On the
one hand, compositions with linear operators have the advantage of keeping the degree of
homogeneity, that is, if P is an n-homogeneous polynomial, then the composition u ◦ P ◦ v
is an n-homogeneous polynomial as well. On the other hand, besides of being a nonlinear
theory with an excessive linear ﬂavor, this approach disregards the fact that compositions
of homogeneous polynomial with homogeneous polynomials are homogeneous polynomials
as well. We are thus compelled to the consideration of classes of homogeneous polynomials
Q such that if P belongs to Q and R and Q are homogeneous polynomials with compatible
domains, then the composition R ◦ P ◦ Q belongs to Q as well. This stronger condition
has been recently studied for some speciﬁc classes, see e.g. [34, 57, 58]. The aim of this
paper is to start the systematic study of classes of homogeneous polynomials that enjoy
this stronger condition, classes which we call polynomial two-sided ideals. We believe that
the study of two-sided ideals explores the nonlinearity of the subject in a more consistent,
deep and fruitful way.

Like any other mathematical concept, polynomial two-sided ideals are worth studying
only if many interesting and useful examples are known. In this paper we pay a special
attention to the production of illustrative examples,
including well studied classes as
well as new classes we introduce here. It is worth mentioning that, as expected, some
well studied polynomial ideals fail to be two-sided ideals; but, somewhat surprisingly,
every time we meet an important polynomial ideal Q1 that is not a two-sided ideal, we
immediately provide a two-sided ideal Q2 that plays, in the two-sided ideal setting, a role
similar to the role played by Q1 in the polynomial ideal setting.

Scrutinizing the already studied important polynomial ideals, we sometimes found
ourselves in the following situation: a given polynomial ideal Q fails to be a two-sided
ideal but satisﬁes a condition that is intermediate between the conditions satisﬁed by
polynomial ideals and two-sided ideals, namely: if a homogeneous polynomial P belongs
to Q and the linear operator u and the homogeneous polynomial Q have compatible
domains, then the composition u ◦ P ◦ Q also belongs to Q. For instance, the class PW of
weakly compact polynomials is a polynomial ideal, fails to be a two-sided ideal and satisﬁes
this intermediate condition. In order not to leave such important classes behind, we study
the classes enjoying this intermediate condition, which shall be called polynomial hyper-
ideals. Observe that this kind of composition also makes sense for multilinear operators.
The corresponding concept for multilinear operators, called multilinear hyper-ideals, was
studied in [15, 16], a study from which we shall take advantage repeatedly.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we deﬁne polynomial two-sided ideals
and hyper-ideals and give some of their general properties. In Section 3 we give plenty of
examples, some of them with distinguished properties, and counterexamples. For instance,
we identify the smallest polynomial two-sided ideal (and hyper-ideal), namely, the class
of hyper-nuclear polynomials (cf. Theorem 3.10). The aim of Section 4 is to establish
the relationship between polynomial two-sided and hyper ideals with multilinear hyper-

2

ideals. We show that the class of polynomials generated by a multilinear hyper-ideal is a
polynomial hyper-ideal and give suﬃcient conditions for it to be a two-sided ideal. Sections
5 and 6 provide methods to generate polynomial hyper/two-sided ideals. In particular,
some well known classes will arise as further examples of polynomial hyper/two-sided
ideals. In Section 7 we make a thorough study of the classical composition polynomial
ideals I◦P, where I is an operator ideal. We prove that I◦P is always a polynomial hyper-
ideal and we give necessary and suﬃcient conditions on I for I ◦ P to be a polynomial
two-sided ideal. Examples of operator ideals I satisfying such necessary and suﬃcient
conditions are provided.

All Banach spaces are over the scalar ﬁeld K = R or C. By P(nE; F ) we mean the
Banach space of all continuous n-homogeneous polynomials from E to F endowed with
the usual sup norm, which shall be denoted by k · k. When F = K we write P(nE), when
n = 1 we write L(E; F ) and when n = 1 and F = K we write E′. For background on
spaces of polynomials we refer to [37, 49].

By a class of polynomials we mean a subclass Q of the class P of all continuous
homogenous polynomials between Banach spaces endowed with a function k · kQ : Q −→
[0, ∞). Given classes of polynomials Q and R and a sequence of positive numbers (Cn)∞
n=1,
(Cn)n
֒−→ R means that Q ⊆ R and kP kR ≤ CnkP kQ for every P ∈ Q(nE; F ).
the symbol Q
When Cn = 1 for every n ∈ N, we simply write Q ֒−→ R.

The identity operator on the Banach space E shall be denoted by idE. We use the

standard notation from the theory of operator ideals (see [31, 54]).

2 Hyper-ideals and two-sided ideals

The next deﬁnition introduces the notions of (p-normed, p-Banach) polynomial hyper-
ideals and two-sided ideals and recalls the notion of polynomial ideals. Given ϕ ∈ E′ and
y ∈ F , consider the n-homogeneous polynomial ϕn ⊗ y ∈ P(nE; F ) given by ϕn ⊗ y(x) =
ϕ(x)ny. Finite sums of polynomial of the this type are called polynomials of ﬁnite type.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let 0 < p ≤ 1, Q be a class of polynomials, (Cn)∞
n=1 be a sequence
of positive real numbers with Cn ≥ 1 for every n ∈ N and C1 = 1, and (Cn, Kn)∞
n=1
be a sequence of pairs of positive real numbers with Cn, Kn ≥ 1 for every n ∈ N and
C1 = K1 = 1. For all n ∈ N and Banach spaces E and F , assume that: (i) the component

Q(nE; F ) := P(nE; F ) ∩ Q

is a linear subspace of P(nE; F ) containing the n-homogenous polynomials of ﬁnite type,

(ii) the restriction of k·kQ to Q(nE; F ) is a p-norm, (iii) kbIn : K −→ K , bIn(λ) = λnkQ = 1

for every n.
(a) We say that Q is a p-normed polynomial (Cn)∞
Hyper-ideal property: For n, m ∈ N, and Banach spaces E, F , G and H, if P ∈
Q(nE; F ), Q ∈ P(mG; E) and t ∈ L(F ; H), then t ◦ P ◦ Q ∈ Q(mnG; H) and

n=1-hyper-ideal if it satisﬁes the

kt ◦ P ◦ QkQ ≤ C n

m · ktk · kP kQ · kQkn.

3

When Cn = 1 for every n ∈ N, we simply say that Q is a p-normed polynomial hyper-
ideal. If the components Q(nE; F ) are complete with respect to the topology generated
by k · kQ, then Q is called a p-Banach polynomial (Cn)∞
n=1-hyper-ideal. When p = 1 we
say that Q is a normed (Banach) polynomial (Cn)∞
If Q is a p-normed
(p-Banach) polynomial (Cn)∞
n=1-hyper-ideal for some p ∈ (0, 1), then we say that it is a
quasi-normed (quasi-Banach) polynomial (Cn)∞
n=1-hyper-ideal. When Q is complete with
respect to the usual sup norm we say that it is a closed polynomial hyper-ideal.

n=1-hyper-ideal.

(b) When the hyper-ideal property holds for every n ∈ N, but only for m = 1, we say that
Q is a p-normed polynomial ideal (remember that C1 = 1). The corresponding notions of p-
Banach polynomial ideal, normed/Banach polynomial ideal, quasi-normed/quasi-Banach
polynomial ideal and closed polynomial ideal are deﬁned in the obvious way.
(c) We say that Q a p-normed polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
Two-sided ideal property: For n, m, r ∈ N, and Banach spaces E, F , G and H, if
P ∈ Q(nE; F ), Q ∈ P(mG; E) and R ∈ P(rF ; H), then R ◦ P ◦ Q ∈ Q(rmnG; H) and

n=1-two-sided ideal if it satisﬁes the

kR ◦ P ◦ QkQ ≤ Kr · C rn

m · kRk · kP kr

Q · kQkrn.

When Cn = Kn = 1, for every n ∈ N we simply say that Q is a p-normed polynomial
n=1-two-
n=1-two-sided ideal, quasi-normed/quasi-
n=1-two-sided ideal, and closed polynomial two-sided ideal,

two-sided ideal. The corresponding notions of p-Banach polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
sided ideal, normed/Banach polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
Banach polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
are deﬁned in the obvious way.

Remark 2.2. (i) The condition C1 = K1 = 1 guarantees that every (normed, quasi-
normed, Banach, quasi-Banach) polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
n=1-two-sided ideal is a (normed,
quasi-normed, Banach, quasi-Banach) polynomial (Cn)∞
n=1-hyper-ideal; and that every
(normed, quasi-normed, Banach, quasi-Banach) polynomial (Cn)∞
n=1-hyper-ideal is a (nor-
med, quasi-normed, Banach, quasi-Banach) polynomial ideal. So, properties of polyno-
mial ideals are inherited by polynomial hyper-ideals and two-sided ideals. For instance,
if Q is a p-normed polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞
n=1-two-sided ideal (or p-normed polynomial
(Cm)∞

m=1-hyper-ideal), then

k · k ≤ k · kQ.

(1)

(ii) Let us see that conditions Cn, Kn ≥ 1 for every n ∈ N are not restrictive. For

hyper-ideals and two-sided ideals, considering the polynomial bIn : K −→ K given by
bIn(λ) = λn, we have

For two-sided ideals,

n · kbI1kQ · kbInk = Cn.
1 = kbInkQ = kbI1 ◦ bInkQ ≤ C 1
1 = kbInkQ = kbIn ◦bI1kQ ≤ Kn · kbInk · kbI1kQ = Kn.

Qn ⊗ y : E −→ F , Qn ⊗ y(x) = Q(x)n · y.

Given Q ∈ P(mE), y ∈ F and n ∈ N, consider the following mn-homogenous polyno-

mial:

A polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is said to have ﬁnite rank, in symbols P ∈ PF (nE; F ), if the
subspace of F generated by the range P (E) of P is ﬁnite dimensional; or, equivalently, if
P is a ﬁnite sum of polynomials of the type Q ⊗ y, where Q ∈ P(nE) and y ∈ F .

Proposition 2.3. Let Q ∈ P(mE), y ∈ F and n ∈ N. If Q a p-normed polynomial
(Cn)∞
n=1-two-sided ideal, then Qn ⊗ y ∈
Q(mnE; F ) and

n=1-hyper-ideal or a p-normed polynomial (Cn, Kn)∞

kQn ⊗ ykQ ≤ C n

m · kQkn · kyk.

If Q is a linear operator or Cn = 1 for every n, then kQn ⊗ ykQ = kQkn · kyk.

Proof. Let us treat the hyper-ideal case (the two-sided ideal case is analogous). By 1 ⊗ y

we mean the operator λ ∈ K 7→ λy ∈ F . Writing Qn ⊗ y = (1 ⊗ y) ◦bIn ◦ Q, the hyper-ideal

property gives Qn ⊗ y ∈ Q(mnE; F ) and

m · k1 ⊗ yk · kQkn = C m

m · kQkn · kyk.

kQm ⊗ ykQ ≤ C n

m · k1 ⊗ yk · kbInkQ · kQkn = C n

For the second assertion, recall that C1 = 1 and combine the inequality we have just
proved with

kQkn · kyk = kQn ⊗ yk ≤ kQm ⊗ ykQ.

The following general properties of hyper-ideals and two-sided ideals of polynomials

can also be proved by standard arguments (see, e.g. [15]).

Proposition 2.4. Given a polynomial hyper-ideal (resp. two sided-ideal) Q, deﬁne

for all n ∈ N and Banach spaces E, F . Then Q is the smallest closed polynomial hyper-
ideal (resp. two sided-ideal) containing Q.

3 Distinguished examples

This section has a twofold purpose: (i) to give illustrative examples of polynomial hyper-
ideals and of polynomial two-sided-ideals; (ii) to give interesting examples of polynomial
ideals that fail to be hyper-ideals and interesting examples of polynomial hyper-ideals
that fail to be two-sided ideals. The main idea is to make clear that it is worth studying
the two new classes, namely, polynomial hyper-ideals and polynomial two-sided-ideals.

Example 3.1. The polynomial ideal Pf of ﬁnite type polynomials is not a hyper-ideal
(hence it is not a two-sided-ideal).
Indeed, it is well known that the 2-homogeneous
polynomial

P : ℓ2 −→ K , P (x) =

x2
j ,

∞Xj=1

is not of ﬁnite type (see, e.g.
hyper-ideal, because otherwise we would have P = idK ◦ P ∈ Pf (2ℓ2).

[15, Example 3.1]). Then Pf cannot be a polynomial

Once the polynomial ideal of ﬁnite type polynomials is out of the game, the class
of ﬁnite rank polynomials is the natural candidate to be the smallest polynomial hyper-
ideal/two-sided ideal. A class of polynomials to which no speciﬁc norm has been assigned
is supposed to be endowed with the usual sup norm.

Theorem 3.2. The class PF of ﬁnite rank homogenous polynomials is the smallest poly-
nomial hyper-ideal and the smallest polynomial two-sided ideal, meaning that PF is a
polynomial two-sided ideal (hence a polynomial hyper-ideal) and if Q is a polynomial
hyper-ideal or a polynomial two-sided ideal, then PF ⊆ Q.

Proof. Since PF is a polynomial ideal, to prove that PF is a polynomial two-sided ideal
(in particular a hyper-ideal), we just need check that R ◦ P ◦ Q ∈ PF (mnrG; H) whenever
P ∈ PF (nE; F ), Q ∈ P(mG; E) and R ∈ P(rF ; H). It is clear that

span{R ◦ P ◦ Q(H)} ⊆ span{R ◦ P (E)} ⊆ span{R(span{P (E)})}.

Since span{P (E)} is ﬁnite-dimensional and homogeneous polynomials on ﬁnite-dimensional
spaces have ﬁnite rank, it follows that R ◦ P ◦ Q has ﬁnite rank. From Proposition 2.3
we know that Q contains all rank 1 homogeneous polynomials, that is, polynomials of
the type Q ⊗ y, where Q is a scalar-valued homogeneous polynomial. Any ﬁnite rank
polynomial is a ﬁnite sum of rank 1 polynomials, hence PF ⊆ Q.

In particular, in the deﬁnitions of polynomial hyper-ideal and polynomial two-sided
ideal, the containment of the ﬁnite type polynomials is equivalent to the containment of
the ﬁnite rank polynomials:

Corollary 3.3. Let Q be a class of continuous homogenous polynomials fulﬁlling the
hyper-ideal property (cf. Deﬁnition 2.1(a)) or the two-sided ideal property (cf. Deﬁnition
2.1(c)) such that each component Q(nE; F ) is a linear subspace of P(nE; F ). Then Pf ⊆
Q if and only if PF ⊆ Q.

6

Example 3.4. It is not diﬃcult to check that the P from Example 3.1 is cannot be
approximated by ﬁnite type polynomials (cf.
[15, Example 3.4]). By Theorem 3.2 it
follows that the class of polynomials that can be approximated, in the uniform norm, by
ﬁnite type polynomials is not a polynomial hyper-ideal.

Later in this section we shall identify the smallest Banach polynomial hyper/two-sided

ideal. Now we can exhibit the smallest closed polynomial hyper/two-sided ideal:

Example 3.5. Combining Proposition 2.4 with Theorem 3.2, we conclude that the class
PF of polynomials that can be approximated, in the uniform norm, by ﬁnite rank poly-
nomials is the smallest closed polynomial two-sided ideal.

Next we show that an example of a Banach polynomial hyper-ideal that fails to be a

two-side-ideal can be found within the classical classes of polynomials:

Example 3.6. On the one hand, the class PK of compact homogeneous polynomials is
closed polynomial two-sided ideal. On the other hand, the class PW of weakly compact
homogeneous polynomials is a closed polynomial hyper-ideal that fails to be a polynomial
two-sided ideal.

The case of PK follows from the fact that continuous homogeneous polynomials send

bounded sets to bounded sets and compact sets to compact sets.

That PW is a polynomial hyper-ideal follows from the following two facts: (i) contin-
uous homogeneous polynomials send bounded sets to bounded sets; (ii) bounded linear
operators are weak-to-weak continuous. Alternatively, see Examples 6.3 and 7.3.

For n ≥ 2, consider the n-homogeneous polynomial

P : ℓ1 −→ ℓ1 , P ((λj)∞

j=1) = (λn

j )∞

j=1.

The polynomial P is not weakly compact because the sequence (P (ej))∞
j=1 has
no weakly convergent subsequence in ℓ1. Write P = Q ◦ ι, were ι : ℓ1 ֒→ ℓ2 is the formal
inclusion and Q ∈ P(nℓ2; ℓ1) is given by the same rule as P . The reﬂexivity of ℓ2 gives
ι ∈ W(ℓ1; ℓ2) = PW (1ℓ1; ℓ2), so PW is not a polynomial two-sided ideal, because otherwise
we would have P = Q ◦ ι ∈ PW (nℓ1; ℓ1). Further details can be found in [11, Example 27].

j=1 = (ej)∞

The example above makes clear that, although the notion of polynomial two-sided
ideal seems to be the right concept, the intermediate notion of hyper-ideal is also worth
being studied, because otherwise the hyper-ideal property of important classes, such as
the class of weakly compact polynomials, would go unnoticed.

Our next purpose is to give an explicit description of the smallest Banach polyno-
mial hyper/two-sided ideal. First we show that the smallest Banach polynomial ideal is
helpless:

Example 3.7. Recall that an n-homogenous polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is nuclear if it
admits a nuclear representation

P (x) =

∞Xj=1

λj(ϕj(x))n · yj for every x ∈ E,

7

where (ϕj)∞
j=1 is a bounded sequence
in F . In the space PN (nE; F ) of all nuclear n-homogenous polynomial from E to F deﬁne

j=1 is a bounded sequence in E′, (λj)∞

j=1 ∈ ℓ1 and (yj)∞

kP kPN = inf( ∞Xj=1

|λj| · kϕjkn · kyjk) ,

where the inﬁmum is taken over all nuclear representations of P . It is well known that
PN is the smallest Banach polynomial ideal. Let us see that PN fails to be a polynomial
hyper/two-sided ideal. In fact, considering the partial sums of a nuclear representation
of a nuclear polynomial, it is not diﬃcult to check that PN ⊆ Pf . In Example 3.4 we saw
that Pf does not contain PF , so PN does not contain PF either. From Theorem 3.2 we
conclude that PN does not fulﬁl the hyper-ideal property.

Once the smallest Banach polynomial ideal is out of the game, we need another class
to play the role of the smallest Banach polynomial hyper/two-sided ideal. To do so we
adapt for polynomial the class of hyper-nuclear multilinear operators introduced in [15].
Henceforth we assume 1/∞ = 0. By ℓr(E) and ℓw
r (E) we denote the spaces os absolutely
r-summable and weakly r-summable E-valued sequences, endowed with their usual norms
(r-norms if 0 < r < 1) k · kr and k · kw,r.

Deﬁnition 3.8. Let s ∈ (0, ∞) and r ∈ [1, ∞] be such that 1 ≤ 1/s + 1/r. An n-
homogenous polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is called:
(i) hyper-(s, r)-nuclear if there are sequences (λj)∞
(yj)∞

j=1 ∈ ℓs, (Pj)∞

r (P(nE)) and

j=1 ∈ ℓ∞(F ) such that

j=1 ∈ ℓw

P (x) =

∞Xj=1

λjPj ⊗ yj(x) =

∞Xj=1

λjPj(x)yj,

(2)

for every x ∈ E. In this case we write P ∈ PHN (s,r)(nE; F ) and deﬁne

kP kPHN (s,r)

= inf{k(λj)∞

j=1ks · k(Pj)∞

j=1kw,r · k(yj)∞

j=1k∞},

where the inﬁmum is taken over all representations of P as in (2).
(ii) strong-(s, r)-nuclear if there are sequences (λj)∞
(yj)∞

j=1 ∈ ℓ∞(F ) such that

j=1 ∈ ℓs, (Pj)∞

j=1 ∈ ℓr(P(nE)) and

P (x) =

∞Xj=1

λjPj ⊗ yj(x) =

∞Xj=1

λjPj(x)yj,

(3)

for every x ∈ E. In this case we write P ∈ PSN (s,r)(nE; F ) and deﬁne

kP kPSN (s,r)

= inf{k(λj)∞

j=1ks · k(Pj)∞

j=1kr · k(yj)∞

j=1k∞},

where the inﬁmum is taken over all representations of P as in (3).

It is plain that PSN (s,r) ֒−→ PHN (s,r). When s = 1 and r = ∞ we simply write PHN

and its elements are called hyper-nuclear polynomials.

Since 1 ≤ 1/s + 1/r, H¨older’s inequality shows that, for every x ∈ G, the series

immediate that the series (4) converges to R ◦ P ◦ Q(x), therefore

∞Xj1,...,jl=1

(λj1 · · · λjl)(Pj1 · · · Pjr) ◦ Q ⊗ ˇR(yj1, . . . , yjl)

The desired inequality follows by taking the inﬁmum over all representations of P .

In particular, taking r = 1 and s = ∞ we get that the class of hyper-nuclear polyno-
mials is a Banach two-sided ideal. Moreover, reasoning as in the proof of [15, Theorem
3.10], we have the following:

Theorem 3.10. The class PHN of hyper-nuclear homogenous polynomials is the smallest
n=1-two-sided ideal (resp. Banach hyper-ideal), in sense that if Q is a

n!(cid:1)∞
Banach (cid:0)1, nn

n=1-two-sided ideal (resp. Banach (Cn)∞

n=1-hyper-ideal), then PHN

Next we see another example of a classical closed polynomial ideal that fails to be a

hyper-ideal:

Example 3.11. Let Pwsc denote the class of weakly sequentially continuous homogeneous
polynomials, that is, continuous homogeneous polynomials that send weakly convergent
sequences to norm convergent sequences. It is well known that Pwsc is a closed polynomial
ideal. Let us see that Pwsc is not a polynomial hyper/two-sided-ideal. Let

P : ℓ2 −→ ℓ1 , P ((λj)∞

j=1) = (λ2

j )∞

j=1.

The sequence (ej)∞
j=1 of canonical unit vectors is weakly null in ℓ2 and non-norm null in
ℓ1, so P /∈ Pwsc(2ℓ2; ℓ1). Since idℓ1 ∈ Pwsc(ℓ1; ℓ1) and P = idℓ1 ◦ P , Pwsc does not satisfy
the hyper-ideal property.

Like the case of other polynomial ideals that fail to be hyper/two-sided ideals, we can
provide a class that, in a certain sense, plays the role of Pwsc in the context of hyper/two-
sided ideals. To do so we use the notion of polynomial convergence (see, for example, [26,
Section 6]). By a scalar-valued polynomial on E we mean a ﬁnite sum of scalar-valued
homogeneous polynomials on E, in general of diﬀerent degrees of homogeneity.

10

Deﬁnition 3.12. (a) A sequence (xj)∞
x ∈ E if p(xj) −→ p(x) for every scalar-valued polynomial p on E.
(b) A polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is said to be polynomially sequentially continuous if
P (xj) −→ P (x) in F whenever (xj)∞

j=1 in a Banach space E converges polynomially to

j=1 converges polynomially to x in E.

Proposition 3.13. The class Ppsc of polynomially sequentially continuous polynomials is
a closed polynomial two-sided ideal.

Proof. It is plain that Ppsc(nE; F ) is linear subspace of P(nE; F ) containing the ﬁnite rank
polynomials. As to the two-sided ideal property, let Q ∈ P(mG; E), P ∈ Ppsc(nE; F ),
R ∈ P(rF ; H) and (xj)∞
j=1 be a sequence in G converging polynomially to x. For every
scalar-valued polynomial p on E, we have that p ◦ Q is a scalar-valued polynomial on G,
so p(Q(xj)) −→ p(Q(x)), showing that (Q(xj))∞
j=1 converges polynomially to Q(x). Since
P is polynomially sequentially continuous, P (Q(xj)) −→ P (Q(x)) in F . The continuity
of R gives R ◦ P ◦ Q(xj) −→ R ◦ P ◦ Q(x) in H, proving that R ◦ P ◦ Q ∈ Ppsc(rnmG; H).
By deﬁnition, polynomially convergent sequences are weakly convergent, hence bounded.
This allows us to follow the steps of the proof of [15, Theorem 4.8] to conclude that
Ppsc(nE; F ) is closed in P(nE; F ).

We shall return to the closed two-sided ideal Ppsc in Example 7.10.

4 Polynomial hyper-ideals and two-sided ideals gen-

erated by multilinear hyper-ideals

We start a series of three sections in which we provide methods to generate polynomial
hyper/two-sided ideals. The ﬁrst method generates polynomial hyper/two-sided ideals
from a given hyper-ideal of multilinear operators. We have so far referred to the notion of
hyper-ideal of multilinear operators several times, but at this point we need the deﬁnition
in detail. We use the usual notation: L(E1, . . . , En; F ) denotes the Banach space of
continuous n-linear operators from E1 × · · · × En to F endowed with the usual sup norm.

If E1 = · · · = En = E, we write L(nE; F ). For A ∈ L(nE; F ), by bA we denote the
n-homogeneous polynomial given by bA(x) = A(x, . . . , x). And for P ∈ P(nE; F ), by ˇP

we mean the unique symmetric n-linear operator in L(nE; F ) such that ( ˇP )∧ = P .

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let p ∈ (0, 1]. A p-normed hyper-ideal of multilinear operators, or simply
a p-normed multilinear hyper-ideal, is a subclass H of the class of all continuous multilinear
operators between Banach spaces endowed with a function k · kH : H −→ [0, ∞) such that
for all n ∈ N and Banach spaces E1, . . . , En and F , the components

H(E1, . . . , En; F ) := L(E1, . . . , En; F ) ∩ H

satisfy:
(1) H(E1, . . . , En; F ) is a linear subspace of L(E1, . . . , En; F ) which contains the n-linear
operators of ﬁnite type, on which k · kH is a p-norm.
(2) kIn : Kn −→ K, In(λ1, . . . , λn) = λ1 · · · λnkH = 1 for every n.
(3) The hyper-ideal property: Given natural numbers n and 1 ≤ m1 < · · · < mn,

11

if B1 ∈ L(G1, . . . , Gm1; E1), . . . , Bn ∈
Banach spaces G1, . . . , Gmn, E1, . . . , En, F, H,
L(Gmn−1+1, . . . , Gmn; En), t ∈ L(F ; H) and A ∈ H(E1, . . . , En; F ), then t◦A◦(B1, . . . , Bn)
belongs to H(G1, . . . , Gmn; H) and

kt ◦ A ◦ (B1, . . . , Bn)kH ≤ ktk · kAkH · kB1k · · · kBnk,

(5)

The notions of p-Banach multilinear hyper-ideal, normed multilinear hyper-ideal, Banach
multilinear hyper-ideal, quasi-normed multilinear hyper-ideal and quasi-Banach multilin-
ear hyper-ideal are deﬁned in the obvious way.

By P we denote the class of all continuous homogenous polynomials between Banach

spaces.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let G be a subclass of the class of all continuous multilinear operators
between Banach spaces endowed with a function k · kG : G −→ R. We deﬁne

(a) P G := {P ∈ P : there is A ∈ G such that P = bA}, and

kP kP G = inf{kAkG : A ∈ G and P = bA}.

(b) PG := {P ∈ P : ˇP ∈ G} and kP kPG = k ˇP kG.

Note that PG ֒−→ P G.

Theorem 4.3. If H is a p-normed (p-Banach) multilinear hyper-ideal, then P H is a

n!(cid:1)∞
p-normed (p-Banach) polynomial(cid:0) nn

n=1-hyper-ideal.

Proof. It is clear that P H(nE; F ) is a linear subspace of P(nE; F ). Using that k · kH
is a p-norm on the componentes of H, it is easy to check that k · kP H is a p-norm on
j ⊗ yj ∈ P(nE; F ),

the components P H. Given a polynomial of ﬁnite type P =

ϕn

ϕj⊗

ˇP =

P ∈ P H(nE; F ).

(n)
· · · ⊗ϕj is an n-linear operator of ﬁnite type, hence ˇP ∈ H. It follows that

kPj=1
It is immediate that kbInkP H ≤ kInkH = 1. Supposing kbInkP H < 1, there would exist

an n-linear form A ∈ H(nK) such that A(λ1, . . . , λn) = λ1 · · · λn for every λ1, . . . , λn ∈ K
and kAkH < 1. In this case,

kPj=1

1 = |A(1, . . . , 1)| ≤ kAk ≤ kAkH < 1,

Given t ∈ L(F ; H), Q ∈ P H(nE; F ) and R ∈ P(mG; E), pick A ∈ H(nE; F ) such that

a contradiction that gives kbInkP H = 1.
bA = Q and B ∈ L(mG; E) such that bB = R. Then t ◦ A ◦ (B, . . . , B) ∈ H(mnG; H). Since

(t ◦ A ◦ (B, . . . , B))∧ = t ◦ Q ◦ R, we conclude that t ◦ Q ◦ R ∈ P H(mnG; H). Furthermore,

kt ◦ Q ◦ RkP H ≤ kt ◦ A ◦ (B, . . . , B)kH ≤ ktk · kAkH · kBkn

Contrary to the case of multilinear/polynomial ideals, it is not to be expected that
PH is a polynomial hyper-ideal whenever H is a multilinear hyper-ideal. Let us give a
brief reasoning. Given a multilinear hyper-ideal H, P ∈ PH(nE; F ) and Q ∈ P(mG; E),
P ◦ Q does not belong to PH in general. Indeed, all we know is that ˇP ∈ H(nE; F ), and
from the hyper-ideal property of H we can only conclude that ˇP ◦ ( ˇQ, . . . , ˇQ) belongs to
H. For P ◦ Q to belong to PH we should have (P ◦ Q)∨ in H, so everything would work
if (P ◦ Q)∨ = ˇP ◦ ( ˇQ, . . . , ˇQ). There is no hope for this equality to hold, because the
multilinear operator ˇP ◦ ( ˇQ, . . . , ˇQ) is not symmetric in general.

Thus we need to impose an extra condition on the multilinear hyper-ideal H to guar-

antee that PH is a polynomial hyper-ideal.

Deﬁnition 4.4. Let Sn denote the group of permutations of {1, . . . , n}. Given a multi-
linear operator A ∈ L(nE; F ) and a σ ∈ Sn, deﬁne Aσ and As in L(nE; F ) by

Aσ(x1, . . . , xn) = A(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n)),

As(x1, . . . , xn) =

1
n!

A(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n)) =

1
n!

Aσ(x1, . . . , xn).

· Xσ∈Sn

· Xσ∈Sn

We say that a subclass G of the class of continuous multilinear operators between
Banach spaces is symmetric if As ∈ G(nE; F ) whenever A ∈ G(nE; F ). If G is endowed with
a function k·kG : G −→ [0, ∞), we say that G is strongly symmetric if Aσ ∈ G and kAσkG =
kAkG for all A ∈ G(nE; F ) and σ ∈ Sn.

The next lemma is a straightforward consequence of the following fact:

if P is a

homogeneous polynomial and A is a multilinear operator such that P = bA, then

ˇP = (bA)∨ = As.

13

Lemma 4.5. A subclass G of the class of continuous multilinear operators between Banach
spaces is symmetric if and only if P G = PG.

Proposition 4.6. (a) If 0 < p ≤ 1 and H is a strongly symmetric p-normed multilinear
hyper-ideal, then

kP kP H ≤ kP kPH ≤ (n!)

(b) If H is a strongly symmetric normed (Banach) multilinear hyper-ideal, then P H = PH

isometrically. In particular, PH is a normed (Banach) polynomial(cid:0) nn

Take the inﬁmum over all such multilinear operators A to get the desired inequality.
(b) P H = PH by Lemma 4.5 and k · kPH = k · kP H by the item (a) with p = 1. The result
follows from Theorem 4.3.

It is clear that some extra condition must be imposed on a multilinear hyper-ideal H
for PH to be a polynomial two-sided ideal. We end this section by providing one such
condition, that is related to the so-called factorization method of generating multilinear
ideals from a given operator ideal (cf., e.g., [11]).

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let H be a p-normed multilinear hyper-ideal and A ∈ L(E1, . . . , En; F ).
We write that A ∈ L ◦ H(E1, . . . , En; F ) if we can ﬁnd natural numbers n and r with
mr = n, a Banach space G, multilinear operators B1 ∈ H(E1, . . . , Em; G), . . . Bm ∈
H(E(m−1)·r, . . . , En; G) and a symmetric multilinear operator C ∈ Ls(rG; F ) such that

A = C ◦ (B1, . . . , Br).

(6)

In this case we write

kP kL◦H = inf{kCk · kB1kH · · · kBrkH},

where the inﬁmum is taken over all factorizations of A as in (6).

Proposition 4.8. (a) If H is a p-normed (p-Banach) multilinear hyper-ideal and L ◦

(b) If H is a normed (Banach) strongly symmetric multilinear hyper-ideal and L◦H֒−→H,

Proof. (a) Having Theorem 4.3 in mind, we only need to show that if P ∈ P H(nE; F )

R ◦ P ∈ P H(nrE; H) and kR ◦ P kP H ≤

For each A ∈ H(nE; F ) such that ˆA = P , it follows easily that R ◦ P = ( ˇR ◦ (A, . . . , A))∧.
Since

ˇR ◦ (A, . . . , A) ∈ L ◦ H(nrE; H) ⊆ H(nrE; H),

it follows that R ◦ P ∈ P H(nrE; H) and

Take the inﬁmum over all such multilinear operators A to get the desired inequality.

5 The inequality method

In this section and in the next one we provide two methods of generating polynomial
hyper/two-sided ideal not passing through multilinear hyper-ideals. We also compare the
resulting classes of polynomials with the classes generated by the procedure of Section 4.
In both cases we give concrete examples of polynomial hyper/two-sided ideals generated
by such methods. These methods are polynomial adaptations of the methods introduced
in [16, Sections 2 and 3]. Let 0 < p, q ≤ 1.

Deﬁnition 5.1. (a) By BAN we denote the class of all Banach spaces over K = R or C
and by p−BAN the class of all p-Banach spaces over K. A correspondence X : BAN −→

15

p−BAN that associates to each Banach space E a p-Banach space (X (E), k · kX (E)) is
called a p-sequence functor if:
(i) X (E) is a linear subspace of EN with the usual algebraic operations;
(ii) For all x ∈ E and j ∈ N, we have (0, . . . , 0, x, 0, . . .) ∈ X (E), where x is placed at the
j-th coordinate, and k(0, . . . , 0, x, 0, . . .)kX (E) = kxkE.
(iii) For every u ∈ L(E; F ) and every ﬁnite sequence (xj)k

j=1 := (x1, . . . , xk, 0, 0, . . .) in E,

k(u(xj))k

j=1kX (F ) ≤ kuk · k(xj)k

j=1kX (E).

When p = 1 we simply say that X is a sequence functor.
(b) A p-sequence functor X is scalarly dominated by the q-sequence functor Y if, for every
ﬁnite sequence (λj)k
(c) Let X be a p-sequence functor and Y be a q-sequence functor. We say that a n-
homogenous polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is (X ; Y)-summing if there is a constant C > 0
such that, for all ﬁnite sequences (xj)k

j=1kX (K) ≤ k(λj)k

j=1 ⊆ K, k(λj)k

j=1 in E, we have

j=1kY(K).

k(P (xj))k

j=1kY(F ) ≤ C ·

sup

R∈BP(n E)

k(R(xj))k

j=1kX (K).

(7)

In this case we write P ∈ P(X ; Y)(nE; F ) and deﬁne

kP kP(X ;Y) = inf{C > 0 : C satisﬁes (7)}.

For a number of examples of sequence functors, see [16, Example 2.2].

Theorem 5.2. Let X be a p-sequence functor and Y be a q-sequence functor with Y
scalarly dominated by X . Then the class P(X ; Y) is a q-Banach polynomial hyper-ideal.

Proof. We shall just check the hyper-ideal property (the remaining conditions follow the
same steps of the proof of [16, Theorem 2.6]). Let P ∈ P(X ; Y)(nE; F ), Q ∈ P(mG; F )
and t ∈ L(F ; H). Of course we can assume Q 6= 0. For every ﬁnite sequence (xj)k
j=1 in G,

k(t ◦ P ◦ Q(xj))k

j=1kY(H) = k(t(P (Q(xj))))k
≤ ktk · kP kP(X ;Y) ·

sup

R∈BP(n E)

j=1kY(H) ≤ ktk · k((P (Q(xj))))k

j=1kY(F )

k(R(Q(xj)))k

j=1kX (K)

= ktk · kP kP(X ;Y) · kQkn ·

≤ ktk · kP kP(X ;Y) · kQkn ·

k((S(xj)))k

j=1kX (K).

j=1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)X (K)

Thus t ◦ P ◦ Q ∈ P(X ; Y)(mnG; H) and kt ◦ P ◦ QkP(X ;Y) ≤ ktk · kP kP(X ;Y) · kQkn.

Let (X ; Y) be the multilinear hyper-ideal determined by the sequence functors X and
Y (cf. [16, Deﬁnition 2.4]). Our next goal is to compare the class P(X ; Y) with the classes
P(X ;Y) and P (X ;Y).

Lemma 5.3. Let X be a p-sequence functor scalarly dominated by the q-sequence functor
Y. Then the q-Banach hyper-ideal (X ; Y) is strongly symmetric.

16

Proof. Let A ∈ (X ; Y)(nE; F ), σ ∈ Sn and (x1
Using that kT k = kTσk for every T ∈ L(nE; F ), we have

j=1kX (K).

Thus Aσ ∈ (X ; Y)(nE; F ) and kAσk(X ;Y) ≤ kAk(X ;Y). Since A = Aσ◦σ−1 = (Aσ)σ−1, from
what we have just proved it follows that

kAk(X ;Y) = k(Aσ)σ−1k(X ;Y) ≤ kAσk(X ;Y).

Therefore kAk(X ;Y) = kAσk(X ;Y).

Proposition 5.4. Let X be a p-sequence functor and Y be a q-sequence functor scalarly
dominated by X . Then P(X ;Y) = P (X ;Y) ⊆ P(X ; Y) and

k · kP(X ;Y) ≤ k · kP (X ;Y) ≤ k · kP(X ;Y).

Proof. The equality P(X ;Y) = P (X ;Y) follows from Lemma 5.3 and Proposition 4.6. The
is obvious. Given P ∈ P (X ;Y)(nE; F ), there exists
inequality k · kP (X ;Y) ≤ k · kP(X ;Y)

A ∈ (X ; Y)(nE; F ) such that bA = P . For x1, . . . , xk ∈ E, since bT ∈ BP(nE) for every

T ∈ BL(nE), we have

k(P (xj))k

j=1kY(F ) = k(A(xj, . . . , xj))k
sup

≤ kAk(X ;Y) ·

j=1kY(F )

k(T (xj, . . . , xj))k

sup

T ∈BL(nE)

sup

R∈BP(n E)

k(bT (xj))k

k(R(xj))k

j=1kX (K)

j=1kX (K),

Therefore P ∈ P(X ; Y) and kP kP(X ;Y) ≤ kAk(X ;Y). Taking the inﬁmum over all multilin-

ear operators A in (X ; Y) such that bA = P we get kP kP(X ;Y) ≤ kP kP (X ;Y).

For p > 0, by ℓp(·) we denote the p-sequence functor E 7→ ℓp(E).

Example 5.5. Let us see that the inclusion in the proposition above is strict. Consider
the sequences functors X = Y = ℓ1(·) and the 2-homogenous polynomial

Noticing that ˇP (x, y) = x⊗y+y⊗x

notation, that P ∈ P(ℓ1(·); ℓ1(·))(2ℓ2; ℓ2b⊗πℓ2) but ˇP /∈ (ℓ1(·); ℓ1(·))(2ℓ2; ℓ2b⊗πℓ2). Therefore

P(ℓ1(·);ℓ1(·)) & P(ℓ1(·); ℓ1(·)).

Next we show that the inequality method recovers, as a particular instance, the fol-

lowing important class of polynomials introduced by V. Dimant [36, Deﬁnition 3.1]:

Proof. Apply Theorem 5.2 with X (E) = Y(E) = ℓp(E).

ss is a p-Banach polynomial hyper-ideal if 0 < p < 1 and a Banach

It is a natural question whether the inequality method, under stronger assumptions,
generate polynomial two-sided ideals. Let us see that, unfortunately, the answer to this
question is unsatisfactory. Given P ∈ P(X ; Y)(nE; F ) and R ∈ P(rF ; H), in order to
prove, under the assumptions of Theorem 5.2, that R◦P belongs to P(X ; Y), the following
two conditions must be satisﬁed:
(C1) If Q ∈ P(nE; F ), k ∈ N and x1, . . . , xk ∈ E, then

k(Q(xj))k

j=1kY(F ) ≤ kQk · k(xj)k

(C2) If k ∈ N and λ1, . . . , λk ∈ K, then
j=1kr

k(λj)k

X (K) ≤ k(λr

j=1kX (K).

It is true that, supposing (C1) and (C2), P(X ; Y) is a polynomial Banach two-sided
ideal. We do not formalize this because the examples of sequence functors satisfying
condition (C2) we are aware of lead to a trivial situation. In fact, the only usual sequence
functor norm satisfying condition (C2) is the supremum norm. But this case is highly
uninteresting:

Proposition 5.8. Let X and Y be sequence functors with Y scalarly dominated by X .
If k(xj)k
kxjk for all E, k and x1, . . . , xk ∈ E, then P(X ; Y)(nE; F ) =

j=1kY(E) = sup

Proof. Let P ∈ P(nE; F ). By the Hahn-Banach Theorem it follows that

kP (x)k ≤ kP k ·

proving that P ∈ P(X ; Y)(nE; F ) and kP kP(X ;Y) = kP k.

One can argue that the we should have the supremum norm only on scalar-valued
sequences. This is correct, but the search for sequence functors having the supremum
norm on scalar-valued sequences and some diﬀerent norm on vector-valued sequences
would lead to artiﬁcial constructions, in which we are not interested.

6 The boundedness method

In this section we show that the polynomial counterpart of the boundedness method
for multilinear hyper-ideals [16, Section 3] generates polynomial hyper-ideals and that a
(reasonable) variant of it generates polynomial two-sided ideals. I-bounded polynomials
were ﬁrst introduced by Aron and Rueda [7]. Let 0 < p ≤ 1.

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let I be a p-normed operator ideal. A polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is
I-bounded if P (BE) ∈ CI(F ), that is, if there are a Banach space H and a linear operator
u ∈ I(H; F ) such that P (BE) ⊆ u(BH). In this case we write P ∈ PhIi(nE; F ) and deﬁne

kP kPhIi = inf{kukI : P (BE) ⊆ u(BH)}.

Reasoning as in the proof of [16, Theorem 3.3] with the help of the series criterion for

polynomial hyper-ideals (Theorem 2.5), we get the

Theorem 6.2. Let I be a p-Banach operator ideal. Then PhIi is a p-Banach polynomial
hyper-ideal.

Example 6.3. Let K and W denote, respectively, the closed ideals of compact and weakly
compact operator. Reasoning as in [7, Example 3.1], we see that CK(E) is the collection
of relatively compact subsets of E and that CW (E) is the collection of relatively weakly
compact subsets of E. Theorem 6.2 gives a second proof of the fact that the classes PK of
compact homogenous polynomials and LW of weakly compact homogenous polynomials
are closed polynomial hyper-ideals.

By LhIi we denote the multilinear hyper-ideal generated by the boundedness method
(see [16, Section 3]), that is, a multilinear operator A ∈ L(E1, . . . , En; F ) belongs to LhIi
if A(BE1 × · · · × BEn) ∈ CI(F ). Next we compare the polynomial hyper-ideal PhIi with
the classes obtained from LhIi by the method of Section 4.

Proposition 6.4. Let 0 < p ≤ 1 and I be a p-Banach operator ideal. Then PhIi =
PLhIi = P LhIi and

Proof. Using that Aσ(BE × · · · × BE) = A(BE × · · · × BE) for every n-linear operator A
and every permutation σ ∈ Sn, it is not diﬃcult to check that the multilinear hyper-ideal
LhIi is strongly symmetric. Proposition 4.6 gives PLhIi = P LhIi and

Conversely, the inclusion PLhIi ⊆ PhIi and the inequality k · kPhIi ≤ k · kPLhIi

follow

easily from the deﬁnitions.

The linear operator u in Deﬁnition 6.1 makes clear that PhIi is not expected to be
a two-sided ideal. Our aim is to introduce a variant of the boundedness method that
generates polynomial two-sided ideals. Curiously enough, we found our way looking at
another method of generating polynomial ideals that does not work well in our nonlinear
setting, namely, the factorization method, which goes back to Pietsch in [55]:

Deﬁnition 6.5. Given a p-normed operator ideal I, 0 < p ≤ 1, and an n-homogenous
polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ), we write P ∈ P ◦ I(nE; F ) if there exist a Banach space G,
a linear operator u ∈ I(E; G) and an n-homogenous polynomial Q ∈ P(nG; F ) such that
P = Q ◦ u, and we deﬁne

kP kP◦I = inf{kQk · kukn

I : P = Q ◦ u with u ∈ I}.

n)∞

is a p

n=1-normed polynomial ideal, meaning that k · kP◦I

It is well known that P ◦ I is a ( p
n -norm on each component P ◦ I(nE; F ) (see, e.g., [11]).
As can be seen in [16, Example 1.1], the factorization method does not generate even
polynomial hyper-ideals in general. Next we show that a combination of the boundedness
method (that generates polynomial hyper-ideals) with the factorization method (that
generates polynomial ideals) is eﬀective in the generation of two-sided-ideals.

Deﬁnition 6.6. Let I be a p-normed operator ideal. For a polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ), if
we can ﬁnd a Banach space H and a polynomial R ∈ P ◦ I(nH; F ) such that

P (BE) ⊆ R(BH),

(9)

we write P ∈ PQ(I)(nE; F ) and deﬁne k · kPQ(I) : PQ(I) −→ [0, ∞) by

kP kPQ(I) = inf{kRkP◦I : R satisﬁes (9)}.

20

Theorem 6.7. Let 0 < p ≤ 1 and I be a p-normed (p-Banach) operator ideal. Then
PQ(I) is a ( p

n=1-Banach) polynomial two-sided ideal.

n=1-normed (( p

n )∞

n)∞

Proof. Let us check the two-sided ideal property. The other conditions of Deﬁnition 2.1
(or of Theorem 2.5 in the complete case) are easily veriﬁed having in mind that P ◦ I
is a ( p
n=1-normed (Banach) polynomial ideal. Let P ∈ PQ(I)(nE; F ), Q ∈ P(mG; E),
R ∈ P(rF ; H) and ε > 0. On the one hand, we can ﬁnd a Banach space E1 and a
polynomial P1 ∈ P ◦ I(nE1; F ) such that P (BE) ⊆ P1(BE1) and

n )∞

kP1kP◦I < (1 + ε)kP kPQ(I).

(10)

Then P ◦ Q(BG) ⊆ kQknP1(BE1). Since kQknP1 ∈ P ◦ I(nE1; F ), we conclude that
P ◦ Q ∈ PQ(I)(nmG; F ) and

kP ◦ QkPQ(I) ≤ k(kQknP1)kP◦I < (1 + ε)kP kPQ(I) · kQkn.

Making ε −→ 0+, we get kP ◦ QkPQ(I) ≤ kP kPQ(I) · kQkn.

On the other hand, from (10) there are a Banach space F1, an operator u ∈ I(E1; F1)

and a polynomial S ∈ P(nF1; F ) such that P1 = S ◦ u and

kSk · kukn

I < (1 + ε)kP kPQ(I).

Then R ◦ P (BE) ⊆ (R ◦ S) ◦ u(BE1). Since (R ◦ S) ◦ u ∈ P ◦ I(nrE1; H), we conclude that
R ◦ P ∈ PQ(I)(nrE; H) and

kR ◦ P kPQ(I) ≤ kR ◦ Sk · kukrn

I ≤ kRk(kSk · kukn

I)r ≤ (1 + ε)rkRk · kP kr

Making ε −→ 0+, we get kR ◦ P kPQ(I) ≤ kRk · kP kr

7 Composition polynomial ideals

In this section we show that the classical composition polynomial ideal I ◦ P, that goes
back to Pietsch [55], is a polynomial hyper-ideal for every operator ideal I, and we
establish a suﬃcient (and necessary) condition on I for I ◦ P to be a polynomial two-
sided-ideal. Examples of operator ideals satisfying such condition are provided.

Deﬁnition 7.1. Let I is a p-normed operator ideal. A polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is said
to belong to I ◦ P if there are a Banach space G, a polynomial Q ∈ P(nE; G) and an
operator u ∈ I(G; F ) such that P = u ◦ Q. Deﬁne k · kI◦P : I ◦ P −→ [0, ∞) by

kP kI◦P = inf{kukI · kQk : P = u ◦ Q, u ∈ I}.

More information on composition ideals can be found in [14]. Actually, there are
two natural norms on I ◦ P (cf.
[14, Deﬁnition 3.6(b)]). The results we prove in this
section will make clear that the norm we have chosen is, in fact, more appropriate to the
hyper/two-sided ideals environment.

21

Theorem 7.2. If I is a p-normed (p-Banach) operator ideal, then I ◦ P is a p-normed
(p-Banach) polynomial hyper-ideal.

Proof. It is well known that I ◦ P is a (complete if I is complete) polynomial ideal, so we
just have to check the hyper-ideal property. Given P ∈ I ◦ P(nE; F ), R ∈ P(mH; E) and
t ∈ L(F ; H1), write P = u◦Q where G is a Banach space, u ∈ I(G; F ) and Q ∈ P(nE; G).
Since

t ◦ P ◦ R = t ◦ (u ◦ Q) ◦ R = (t ◦ u) ◦ (Q ◦ R),

t ◦ u ∈ I(G; H1) and Q ◦ R ∈ P(mnH; G), we have t ◦ P ◦ R ∈ I ◦ P(mnH; H1). Moreover,

kt ◦ P ◦ RkI◦P = k(t ◦ u) ◦ (Q ◦ R)kI◦P ≤ kt ◦ ukI · kQ ◦ Rk ≤ ktk · (kukI · kQk) · kRkn.

The hyper-ideal inequality follows by taking the inﬁmum over all such factorizations of
P .

Example 7.3. Ryan [60] proved that

PK = K ◦ P and PW = W ◦ P.

So, Theorem 7.2 gives one more proof that the classes PK of compact polynomials and
PW of weakly compact polynomials are closed polynomial hyper-ideals.

To give another remarkable example we need of the following deﬁnition introduced by

Aron and Rueda [6] (the linear case is due to Sinha and Karn [61]).

Deﬁnition 7.4. Let p, q ≥ 1 be such that 1
P ∈ P(nE; F ) is called p-compact if there is a sequence (xj)∞

p + 1

q = 1. An n-homogenous polynomial

j=1 ∈ ℓp(F ) such that

P (BE) ⊆( ∞Xj=1

λjxj : (λj)∞

j=1 ∈ Bℓq) .

(11)

In this case we write P ∈ PKp(nE; F ) and deﬁne

kP kPKp = inf{k(xj)∞

j=1kp : (xj)∞

j=1 satisﬁes (11)}.

Making n = 1 we recover the extensively studied Banach ideal Kp of p-compact linear
operators (see, e.g., [56] and references therein).

Example 7.5. Combining [6, Theorem 3.1] and [14, Proposition 3.2] we get that PKp =
Kp ◦ P isometrically. Therefore the class PKp of p-compact polynomials is a Banach
polynomial hyper-ideal by Theorem 7.2.

By I ◦L we denote the composition multilinear ideal, that is, A ∈ I ◦L(E1, . . . , En; F )
if there are a Banach space G, an n-linear operator B ∈ L(E1, . . . , En; G) and an operator
u ∈ I(G; F ) such that A = u ◦ B. The function k · kI◦L is deﬁned in the obvious way.

22

Proposition 7.6. For every p-normed (p-Banach) operator ideal I,

And if P ∈ I ◦ P(nE; F ), then

I ◦ P = PI◦L = P I◦L.

kP kP I◦L ≤ kP kPI◦L ≤ (n!)

p −1kP kP I◦L and kP kI◦P ≤ kP kPI◦L ≤ c(n, E)kP kI◦P,

where c(n, E) is the n-th polarization constant of the Banach space E.

Proof. The class I ◦ L of multilinear operators is strongly symmetric (cf. [14, Proposition
3.3]), so PI◦L = P I◦L. The corresponding inequalities follow from Proposition 4.6. Having

in mind that if P = u ◦ Q, then ˇP = u ◦ ˇQ, and if A = t ◦ B, then bA = t ◦ bB; the equality

I ◦ P = PI◦L follows immediately. The remaining norm inequalities follow from [14,
Proposition 3.7.(b)].

The next natural step is to study composition ideals from the perspective of two-sided
ideals. Sometimes composition ideals are polynomial two-sided ideals, for example the
class PK = K ◦ P of compact polynomials. But sometimes they are not two-sided ideals,
for example the class PW = W ◦ P of weakly compact polynomials (cf. Example 3.6). So,
some extra condition on I is needed for I ◦ P to be a two-sided ideal. The rest of the
paper is devoted to the search of such a condition and of operator ideals I satisfying it.
The idea of the condition we shall provide, which is not only suﬃcient but also necessary,
was based on [8, Proposition 3.3].

Proof. (a)=⇒(b) Given P ∈ P ◦ I(nE; F ), there are a Banach space G, a linear operator
u ∈ I(E; G) and a polynomial Q ∈ P(nG; F ) such that P = Q ◦ u. Since the linear
component of I ◦ P is the operator ideal I and I ◦ P is a polynomial two-sided ideal by
assumption, we conclude that P = Q ◦ u belongs I ◦ P and

kP kI◦P ≤ CnkQk · kukn

I◦P = CnkQk · kukn
I.

Taking the inﬁmum over all factorizations it follows that kP kI◦P ≤ CnkP kP◦I.
(b) =⇒ (a) According to the deﬁnition of two-sided ideals (or to the corresponding series
criterion in the complete case) and using that I ◦ P is a p-normed (p-Banach) polynomial
hyper-ideal (Theorem 7.2), we only need to check the right-hand side of the two-sided
ideal property. To do so, let P ∈ I ◦ P(nE; F ) and R ∈ P(rF ; H). There are a Banach
space G, an n-homogenous polynomial Q ∈ P(nE; G) and a linear operator u ∈ I(G; F )
such that P = u ◦ Q. By assumption, R ◦ u ∈ P ◦ I ⊆ I ◦ P, so the hyper-ideal property
of I ◦ P gives

R ◦ P = (R ◦ u) ◦ Q ∈ I ◦ P(rnE; H),

and

where the second inequality follows from the assumption. It follows that kR ◦ P kI◦P ≤

and the corresponding norm inequality. By [14, Propositions 3.2(b) and 3.7(b)] we have

Of course the proposition above can be used to give positive and negative examples.

Let us start with a negative example regarding a celebrated operator ideal.

Example 7.9. Let Πp, p ≥ 1, be the Banach ideal of absolutely p-summing linear oper-
ators. By Theorem 7.2, Πp ◦ P is a Banach polynomial hyper-ideal. Consider the class
Pd,p of p-dominated polynomials, which also goes back to Pietsch [55]. In [10, Example
1] (see also [11, Remark 47]), it is established that

Pn : ℓ1 −→ ℓ1 , Pn((λj)∞

j=1) = ((λj)n)∞

j=1,

is a p-dominated non-weakly compact n-polynomial. Since Πp ◦ P ⊆ W ◦ P = PW , Pn
does not belong to Πp ◦ P. From Pd,p = P ◦ Πp [11, Proposition 46(a)], it follows that
Pn belongs to P ◦ Πp. Thus P ◦ Πp * Πp ◦ P, and from Theorem 7.8 we conclude that
Πp ◦ P is not a polynomial two-sided ideal. In Example 7.13 we shall see that Πdual
◦ P
is a Banach polynomial two-sided ideal.

Before giving positive examples, let us treat a case that, to the best of our knowledge,

is open.

n,s

Example 7.10. Let CC denote the closed ideal of completely continuous linear operators
(weakly convergent sequences are sent to norm convergent sequences). Assuming that
CC ◦ P is a polynomial two-sided ideal, by Theorem 7.8, CC would be s-tensorstable.
πs E = ⊗n,sidE, in this case it would be true that the symmetric projective
Noting that id b⊗
tensor product of a Schur space is a Schur space. But it is an open problem if the projective
tensor product of a Schur space is a Schur space, so it is unknown if CC is s-tensorstable,
that is, if CC ◦P is a polynomial two-sided ideal. In our opinion, it is likely that the answer
to the aforementioned open problem will turn out to be negative (see [15, p. 19]), so we
conjecture that CC ◦ P is not a polynomial two-sided ideal. Recall the closed polynomial
two-sided ideal Ppsc of polynomially sequentially continuous polynomials (Proposition
It is easy to check that CC ◦ P ⊆ Ppsc. The conjecture above yields that the

inclusion is strict.

In order to give examples of operators ideal I for which I ◦ P is a polynomial two-
sided ideal using Theorem 7.8, we recall the notion of π-tensorstable ideals [31, Section 34],

n-fold projective tensor product of E1, . . . , En, given operators u1 ∈ L(E1; F1), . . . , un ∈

which we shall simply call tensorstable ideals. Denoting by E1b⊗π · · ·b⊗πEn the completed
L(En; Fn), there is a unique operator u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un : E1b⊗π · · ·b⊗πEn −→ F1b⊗π · · ·b⊗πFn

u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn) = u1(x1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ un(xn),

such that

for x1 ∈ E1, . . . , xn ∈ En. When u = u1 = · · · = un, we write simply ⊗nu.

Deﬁnition 7.11. A p-normed operator ideal I is tensorstable if there is a sequence

We ﬁnish the paper by providing examples of operator ideals I for which I ◦ P is a

polynomial two-sided ideal.

of the ideal Πp of absolutely summing p-operators, which coincides with
of the ideal Kp of p-compact operators [56, Theorems 12, 24, 25].

Example 7.13. The following Banach operator ideals I are tensorstable, hence s-tensor-
stable by Proposition 7.12, therefore I ◦ P is a Banach polynomial two-sided ideal by
Theorem 7.8:
(a) The dual Πdual
the maximal hull Kmax
(b) The closed ideal S of separable operators [8, Example 3.5(a)].
(c) The ideals F
(d) The ideal J of integral operators [44, Theorem 2].
(e) The ideal L∞,q,γ of Lorentz-Zygmund operators, 0 < q ≤ 1 and −1/q < γ < ∞ [28,
Theorem 3.1].
(f) The ideals L1,q, q > 1, of (1, q)-factorable operators and K1,p, p > 1, of (1, p)-compact
operators [25, Theorem 2.1].
(g) For p ≥ 1, the dual J dual

As Carl, Defant and Ramanujan perspicaciously observed in [25], the constants on the

norm inequality appear naturally in the proof of the tensor stability.

Open question. We do not know if every s-tensorstable operator ideal is tensorstable. If
yes, Example 7.9 will have a simpler reasoning (in [31, Corollary 34.3.1] it is proved that
Πp is not tensorstable); and Theorem 7.8 will have one more equivalent condition. But
the reader should have in mind that things that work well for homogeneous polynomials
might not work so well for multilinear operators. For example, Leung [46] proved that
the dual J ′ of the James space J is symmetrically regular but fails to be regular.
