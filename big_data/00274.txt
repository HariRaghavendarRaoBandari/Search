A well-known method for calculating an approximation to the pair creation rate in the Sauter-
Schwinger eﬀect is based on approximating solutions of the Riccati equation. Although several
interesting ﬁeld conﬁgurations can be examined in this formalism, its application is fundamentally
restricted to the case of solely time-dependent ﬁelds. We propose a new WKB-like technique for
approximating the pair creation rate in the presence of spacetime-dependent ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

i.e.

The Sauter-Schwinger eﬀect [1–3],

electron-
positron pair production due to a strong electric ﬁeld,
is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynam-
ics (QED) that has not been veriﬁed experimentally yet.
Although Sauter calculated the pair production rate for
two diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the electric ﬁeld already
more than 80 years ago [1], the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld’s
spacetime dependence on Sauter-Schwinger pair creation
is far from being fully understood yet.

Several methods have been developed for computing
approximations to the pair production rate, such as the
WKB method [4, 6] or the Worldline-instanton method
[5], but most of them are focusing on the case of solely
time-dependent electric ﬁelds. In this paper, we present a
new method that promises to overcome this fundamental
restriction. We start by expanding solutions of the Dirac
equation using solutions of the eikonal (or Hamilton-
Jacobi) equation, giving two linear coupled partial dif-
ferential equations. An approximative solution to these
equations is then attained under the assumption that the
number of produced electron-positron pairs is small. Fi-
nally, we calculate the pair production rate for a truly
spacetime-dependent ﬁeld.

II. EIKONAL EXPANSION

We start with the covariant Dirac equation

(cid:2)iγµ(cid:0)∂µ +iqAµ

(cid:1) − m(cid:3) ψ = 0,

where Aµ are the components of a possibly spacetime-
dependent electromagnetic potential and γµ are the
gamma matrices satisfying the Cliﬀord algebra’s anti-
commutation relation

We deﬁne two operators

{γµ, γν} = 2gµν.

M± = −γµ(cid:0)∂µ S± + qAµ

(2)

with S± being two independent solutions of the eikonal
equation

gµν(cid:0)∂µ S± + qAµ
M 2± = γµγν(cid:0)∂µ S± + qAµ
= gµν(cid:0)∂µ S± + qAµ

(cid:1) (∂ν S± + qAν) = m2.
(cid:1) (∂ν S± + qAν)
(cid:1) (∂ν S± + qAν)

We then have

= m2.

Thus, the operators M± both have the two distinct eigen-
values ±m. Let u± and v± be their respective eigenvec-
tors deﬁned as follows

M+u± = ±mu±, M−v± = ±mv±.

Upon expanding the spinor ψ in terms of the solutions of
the eikonal equation,

ψ = αu+eiS+ + βv+eiS− ,

the Dirac equation reduces to

iγµ ∂µ (αu+) eiS+ + iγµ ∂µ (βv+) eiS− = 0.

We can write the eigenvectors u± and v± as follows

Using these, the operators M± have the following form

Note that
γ0γ1u+ = −σyu+ = −iu−, γ0γ1u− = −σyu− = iu+,
γ0γ1v− = −σyv− = iv+.
γ0γ1v+ = −σyv+ = −iv−,
(3)

Multiplying (1) with γ0/i leads to

∂t (αu+) eiS+ + γ0γ1 ∂x (αu+) eiS+

+ ∂t (βv+) eiS− + γ0γ1 ∂x (βv+) eiS− = 0.

Using the identities from (3) this can be written as
eiS+ (u+ ∂t α + α ∂t u+ − iu− ∂x α − iα ∂x u−)
+eiS− (v+ ∂t β + β ∂t v+ − iv− ∂x β − iβ ∂x v−) = 0.

(4)

To transform this into partial diﬀerential equations for α
and β we want to project this equation onto the eigen-
vectors u+ and v+. We deﬁne several quantities that will
simplify the resulting expressions:

= N+N− (1 − a+a−) ,
= iN+N− (a+ − a−) ,

= u− · v−

µ can also be written as follows

Other scalar products of the eigenvectors with their
derivatives can be expressed using the quantities deﬁned

u+ · ∂µ v− = −ηξ−

u± · ∂µ u± = 0,

v+ · ∂µ u+ = −χξ+

v+ · ∂µ u− = −ηξ+

v± · ∂µ v± = 0,

Finally, projecting (4) onto u+ and v+ leads to the fol-
lowing two coupled partial diﬀerential equations for α
and β

∂t α = −iξ+

III. APPROXIMATING THE PAIR

PRODUCTION RATE

2

As solving the coupled partial diﬀerential equations
given in (6) and (7) is hard, especially in the presence
of spacetime-dependent electric ﬁelds, we proceed with
an approximative approach. We assume that the electric
ﬁeld is switched oﬀ initially (i.e. for t → −∞) and ﬁnally
for t → ∞), so that the solutions of the eikonal
(i.e.
equation correspond to plane waves initially and ﬁnally,
i.e.

S±(t, x)

t→±∞−−−−→ ∓ωt + kx, ω =

m2 + k2,

(8)

(cid:112)

where ω and k are the energy and the momentum of the
particle respectively. Here we have employed the conven-
tion that S+ and S− correspond to the solution that has
positive and negative energy initially respectively. When
the strength of the electric ﬁeld is subcritical, we expect
β (i.e. the coeﬃcient of the negative-energy solution) and
its derivatives to be much smaller than α (i.e. the coeﬃ-
cient of the positive-energy solution) and its derivatives.
Thus in this case, (6) is approximately equivalent to

Θ(t(cid:48), x)e2iS(t(cid:48),x)+Ξ(t(cid:48),x) dt(cid:48) .

Thus, we see that a solution φ(t, x) that consists of a
positive-energy plane wave only initially,
ψin(t, x) = e−iωint+kinx,

ﬁnally evolves into a mixture of positive- and negative-
energy plane waves,

ψout(t, x) = e−iωoutt+koutx +

β(t, x)
α(t, x)

eiωoutt+koutx.

Therefore, the pair production density is given by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) β(t, x)

.

Pe+e− = lim

≈ lim
t→∞

(12)

The total number of created pairs for a speciﬁc initial
momentum can then be calculated by integrating (12)
over all x.

If the electric ﬁeld does only depend on the time t, we
can use the temporal gauge A0 = 0, A1 = A(t). Two
independent solutions of the eikonal equation are then
given by

S± = ∓φk(t) + kx,

(cid:113)

Ωk(t(cid:48)) dt(cid:48) , Ωk(t) =

m2 + (k + qA(t))2.

where

φk(t) =

(cid:90) t

−∞

Thus, in this case the pair production density (12) sim-
pliﬁes to

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2m

exp [−2iφk(t)] dt

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

.

Comparing this to equation (12) in [6], we ﬁnd that the
only relevant diﬀerence between these two expressions is
the prefactor of the integrand. This can be attributed
to the diﬀerent approximations that were made when de-
riving these formulae. However, exactly because of those
approximations, we do not expect the integral in (12) to
give the correct prefactor for the pair production rate but
only the exact exponent anyway.

the integrand in t and solve the integral by methods of
contour integration. Thus, we have to choose a appropri-
ate integration contour and determine the singularities
of the integrand. As S± are linear functions of time t
for t → ±∞ according to (8), the integrand in (12) is
suppressed exponentially in the lower half-plane by the
factor exp[2iS(t(cid:48), x)]. Therefore, we choose a semi-circle
in the lower half-plane with key holes for avoiding any
singularities and branch cuts as our integration contour.
However, often we are only interested in the exponent
of the pair production density—as well because we do not
expect the prefactor to come out right with the approxi-
mations we made. To leading order, the pair production
density integral in (12) is dominated by the value of the
exponential factor exp(2iS + Ξ) at the singularity in the
lower half-plane that is closest to the real axis.

Looking at (12) and the deﬁnitions of Θ and Ξ in (10)
and (11) respectively, we see that the integrand’s only
singularities can be where S± or a± have got singularities,
or where a+ or a− is ±1. Using the deﬁnition of a± (see
(2)), we can conclude that a± can only have singularities
where S± or Aµ are singular, or where the denominator
∂x S± + qA1 vanishes. Inserting ∂x S± + qA1 = 0 into
the 1 + 1-dimensional eikonal equation,

(∂t S± + qA0)2 − (∂x S± + qA1)2 = m2,

(13)
reveals that in that case ∂t S± + qA0 = ±m. Thus, if the
denominator of a± vanishes, the numerator will either be
2m or vanish, too. In the ﬁrst case a± will have a pole at
that point while in the second a± is of the indeterminate
form 0/0. Let us assume now that the latter occurs at
t∗ for either a+ or a−. We then can evaluate the limit
of a± as t approaches t∗ using the eikonal equation and
l’Hˆospital’s rule to show that a± is actually well-deﬁned
at t∗:

m ±(cid:113)

m2 + (∂x S± + qA1)2
∂x S± + qA1
± (∂x S± + qA1)
m2 + (∂x S± + qA1)2

Furthermore, from the deﬁnition in (2) we know that

the a± are either −1 or +1 if and only if

(m + ∂t S± + qA0)2 = (∂x S± + qA1)2 .

Inserting the eikonal equation in 1 + 1 dimensions (13)
into this gives, after some manipulation,

IV. CALCULATING THE PAIR PRODUCTION

INTEGRAL

∂t S± + qA0 = −m.

Our general strategy for solving the integral in (12) will
be as follows: We try to ﬁnd the analytic continuation of

But from the calculation above we already know that a±
vanishes where ∂t S± + qA0 = −m, so we can conclude
that the a± are nowhere equal to −1 or +1.

In conclusion, the only possible singularities of the in-

tegrand in (12) are

• singularities of S±,
• singularities of Aµ so that a± is singular,
• poles where ∂x S± + qA1 = 0 and ∂t S± + qA0 = m.
Note that because ∂t S± + qA0 and ∂x S± + qA1 cor-
respond to energy and momentum of a classical parti-
cle respectively, the points where ∂t S± + qA0 = m and
∂x S± + qA1 = 0 are the classical turning points of an
electron.

V.

INVERSE APPROACH TO THE EIKONAL

EQUATION

To solve the eikonal equation (13) in the presence
of spacetime-dependent ﬁelds we employ an inverse ap-
proach. In order to do this, we write the two independent
solutions S± using two other functions R and S, which
are deﬁned according to

S+ = R + S,
S− = R − S,

⇔ R =

S =

1
2
1
2

(S+ + S−) ,
(S+ − S−) .

Applying a gauge transformation

qAµ (cid:55)→ qA(cid:48)
S± (cid:55)→ S(cid:48)

µ = qAµ + ∂µ R,
± = S± − R = ±S,

eliminates the dependency on the symmetric part R. In-
serting this into the eikonal equation (13) gives

(± ∂t S + qA(cid:48)

0)2 − (± ∂x S + qA(cid:48)

1)2 = m2,

(14)

From now on, we drop the primes on the potential com-
ponents. Solving the two equations given in (14) for qA0
and qA1 leads to

qA0 = ± (∂x S)

qA1 = ± (∂t S)

1 −

m2

(∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 ,

(15)

1 −

m2

(∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 ,

where the ± sign denotes two diﬀerent sets of solutions
that can be generated using the same function S. The
qAµ given here have poles where (∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 van-
ishes, branch points where (∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 = m2 and
other singularities where S is singular. However, the a±
do not have poles where (∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 = 0, as can be
seen by expanding the fraction in the expression for a±
by (∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2.

Therefore in this case, the only possible singularities

of the integrand in (12) are

(cid:115)
(cid:115)

• singularities of S±,
• branch points where (∂t S)2 − (∂x S)2 = m2,
• poles where ∂x S± + qA1 = 0 and ∂t S± + qA0 = m.

VI. TEMPORAL PULSE WITH SPATIAL

PERTURBATION

To demonstrate how our method can be used to
estimate the pair production rate in the presence of
spacetime-dependent ﬁelds, we guess a (somewhat artiﬁ-
cial) solution to (14),

and calculate the components of the electromagnetic po-

sign here. Using these, the initial and ﬁnal frequencies
and momenta can be calculated:

The electric ﬁeld can then be computed from

E = ∂t A1 − ∂x A0.

For the function S chosen here, it consists of a (asymmet-
ric) pulse whose amplitude depends oscillates with the
spatial coordinate x (see ﬁgure 1).
It should be noted
that the electric ﬁeld E for the S given in (16) can be
indeed calculated analytically but the result is a rather
lengthy expression that will be left out here for the sake
of brevity.

It can be shown that in this case the dominant singu-
larity of the pair production integral is the branch point
due to the square root in S at

In addition, for this example Ξ(t, x) = 0 everywhere.
Therefore, the pair production density to leading order

solutions for electric ﬁelds depending on both t and x
can be generated. As was shown in the last section, such
solutions may then be analyzed to calculate an approxi-
mation to the pair production rate.

Still, our toy example given there exhibits a ﬂaw that
is not obvious from the plot in ﬁgure 1 alone: Due to
how the inverse approach works, the expression for the
electric ﬁeld E still depends on all of the parameters of
S. For example, the strength of the electric ﬁeld can not
be changed without changing ωin or ωout and vice versa.
Therefore, a statement about how the pair creation rate
for a speciﬁc mode depends on the ﬁeld strength for this
pulse form cannot be made.

This is problem that will often occur with solutions
generated using an inverse approach. Future work has to
be done to derive solutions of the eikonal equation that
do not show this weakness.

Nevertheless, the expression for the pair production
density given in (17) is within expectations: Pair produc-
tion is less likely for higher frequencies (i.e. momenta)
and becomes highly probable if the pulse width is of the
order of the electron’s frequency, i.e. 2Ω ∼ ωin + ωout,
thereby entering the regime of non-perturbative pair pro-
duction.

Finally, the formalism presented here should be gen-
eralized to 3 + 1 dimensions to facilitate analyzing ﬁeld
conﬁgurations that resemble the experimental situation
a lot better.

VII. CONCLUSIONS & OUTLOOK

We have developed a new method for approximating
the pair production rate in the presence of arbitrary
spacetime-dependent ﬁelds that resembles much of the
WKB-like approach that is pursued in the formalism
based on the Riccati equation [4, 6]. The method relies
on being able to ﬁnd solutions of the eikonal equation in
the presence of spacetime-dependent ﬁelds which is not
an easy task per se. However using an inverse approach,
