ABSTRACT

Recently, Keane et al. reported the discovery of a fading radio transient following FRB 150418, and
interpreted it as the afterglow of the FRB. Williams & Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the
radio transient is analogous to a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN
ﬂare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a re-brightening,
which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio survey data of Ofek et al., we
statistically examine the chance coincidence probability to produce an event like the FRB 150418
transient. We ﬁnd that the probabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same
variability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient, without and with the
VLA point, are P1 ∼ 6 × 10−4 and P1 ∼ 2 × 10−3, respectively. In addition, the chance probability
to have a fading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than P2 ∼ 10−2.9±1.3.
Putting these together and assuming that the number of radio sources within one Parkes beam is 16,
the ﬁnal chance coincidence of having an FRB 150418-like radio transient to be unrelated to the FRB
is < 10−4.9±1.3 and < 10−4.4±1.3, respectively, without and with the VLA point. We conclude that
the radio transient following FRB 150418 has a low probability being an unrelated AGN ﬂare, and
the possibility of being the afterglow of FRB 150418 is not ruled out.

1. INTRODUCTION

than the values

expected for

so that

Fast Radio Bursts

(FRBs) are bright millisec-
onds radio transients with dispersion measure (DM)
much larger
the
Milky Way galaxy,
they are expected to
have an extragalactic origin (Lorimer et al. 2007;
Keane et al. 2011; Thornton et al. 2013; Spitler et al.
2014; Burke-Spolaor & Bannister 2014; Champion et al.
2015; Masui et al. 2015; Ravi et al. 2015; Petroﬀ et al.
2015; Keane et al. 2016). However, due to the large po-
sitional uncertainty (∼ 14 arcminutes), no FRB has been
previously well located to allow a distance measurement.
Recently, Keane et al. (2016) reported the discovery of
a radio transient following FRB 150418 starting from 2
hours after the FRB, which faded away in 6 − 8 days.
They claimed that the radio transient is the afterglow of
the FRB, and used it to identify an elliptical galaxy at
z = 0.492± 0.002. The measured baryon number density
Ωb based on this redshift is consistent with the value in-
ferred from the CMB data, lending an indirect support to
the association. If such an association is established, the
brightness of the radio afterglow is consistent with that
of a double compact star merger system (Zhang (2016)
and references therein).

However, shortly after the publication of the discov-
ery, Williams & Berger (2016) suggested that the chance
probability of having a radio variable source within
one Parkes beam is of the order of unity, and argued
that the so-called afterglow of FRB 150418 discovered
by Keane et al. (2016) could be simply an unrelated
AGN radio ﬂare in spatial coincidence with the FRB.
Williams et al. (2016) further observed the source and
claimed a re-brightening of the host, which strengthened
the AGN interpretation.

Here we statistically examine the chance probability
of having a transient source similar to the putative af-
terglow of FRB 150418. We notice the following im-

portant facts: 1. The ﬁrst two data points in 5.5 GHz
of Keane et al. (2016) are 0.27(5) mJy per beam and
0.23(2) mJy per beam, respectively, which are a factor
of 2.5-3 times of the claimed “quiescent” ﬂux 0.09 mJy
per beam at later time, as shown in the left panel of
Figure 1. The standard deviation is too large for a ﬂux
ﬂuctuation due to scintillation, suggesting that these two
points have to be related to a ﬂaring object. 2. The ﬂux
is fading during the ﬁrst 6-8 days after the FRB. Our
simulations intend to address the probability of having
a variable source with such a large ﬂux variability in the
FRB observation beam (Sect. 2), and the probability to
have a bright ﬂare that is fading from 2 hours to 8 days
after the FRB (Sect. 3). We ﬁnd a very small overall
probability. We also compare some short GRB radio af-
terglows with the FRB 150418 transient, and ﬁnd that
the probabilities that some short GRB afterglows to be
confused as AGN ﬂares due to chance coincidence could
be comparable to that of the putative afterglow of FRB
150418 (Sect. 4). Putting it together, we argue that the
possibility that the radio transient is the intrinsic after-
glow of the FRB is not ruled out.

2. SPATIAL AND FLUX COINCIDENCE

PROBABILITY

Williams & Berger (2016) argued that the probability
of ﬁnding a radio source in each Parkes beam is Nr =
16, and that of ﬁnding a variable radio source is ∼ 0.6.
However, the true question is: what is the probability of
ﬁnding a variable radio source with the amplitude and
S/N at least those of the transient following FRB 150418?
To address this question, similar to Williams & Berger
(2016), we make use of the 5 GHz survey data with
Very Large Array (VLA) and the expanded VLA by
Ofek et al. (2011). There are 464 sources in the main
catalog of Ofek et al. (2011). For each source, there are
14 − 16 observations (see Table 6 of Ofek et al. (2011),

2

which lists all the observation results).
In order to
compare with the observation of FRB 150418 afterglow
candidate (Keane et al. 2016), we randomly select the
same number of observational epochs as FRB 150418
for each source, and calculate the relative standard de-
viation STD/hfi as well as median signal-to-noise ratio
S/N. We do it 1000 times for each source, so that we
have 464,000 simulated mock observations. Similar to
Fig. 2 of Williams & Berger (2016), we present the S/N
- STD/hfi two-dimensional distribution of these mock
events in the right panel of Figure 1. For the sake of
clear presentation, only a random set of 4,640 mock
events are shown. For comparison, the FRB afterglow
candidate, which has STD/hfi = 0.54 and median S/N
= 5.4 with the observational data of Keane et al. (2016),
is also marked as the red star in the right panel of Fig.
1. Williams et al. (2016) reported an observation of the
FRB host on 2016 Feb 27 and 28, which has a ﬂux 0.157
± 0.006 mJy/beam. By including this point, the FRB af-
terglow candidate has STD/hfi = 0.48 and median S/N
= 5.5. It is shown as the orange star in the right panel
of Fig. 1.

An immediate observation from Fig.1 is that a large
STD/hfi tends to appear for small S/N values. At the
S/N for FRB 150418, the observed STD/hfi in gen-
eral is much smaller than that of the FRB 150418 tran-
sient. Williams & Berger (2016) argued that the tran-
sient source is consistent with the distribution of the
Ofek et al. (2011) sources. However, we argue that it
is more important to check the chance probability to
have a variable source with both STD/hfi and S/N at
least the values inferred from the FRB 150418 tran-
sient. From our mock sample, the fraction of events
that have STD/hfi larger than STD/hfiFRB and me-
dian S/N larger than S/NFRB for the Keane et al. (2016)
data only (without the late VLA point of Williams et al.
(2016)) turns out to be P1 ∼ 6 × 10−4. It indicates that
the average number of events which could be as bright
as the FRB transient in the Parkes beam by chance is
Nv = NrP1 ∼ 0.009. Adding the latest VLA observa-
tional point Williams et al. (2016), this fraction is in-
creased to P1 ∼ 2 × 10−3, and the variable number be-
comes Nv = NrP1 ∼ 0.031. Therefore, even if the radio
variable source may be common, the chance probability
of having a high-variability radio transient similar to the
putative FRB 150418 afterglow within the FRB 150418
Parkes beam is small.

We also try to compare the FRB afterglow candidate
with Mooley et al. (2016), who monitored a larger sky
area and have more radio sources in their catalog. Since
there are only two observational points in week timescale
for each source in Mooley et al. (2016), we choose the
ﬁrst observational point of Keane et al. (2016), i.e. 0.27±
0.05 mJy, and the quiescent ﬂux, 0.09 ± 0.02 mJy, to
compare with those in Mooley et al. (2016). Using the
distribution of m = ∆f
¯f , analogous to STD/hfiFRB, and
Vs = ∆f
σ , analogous to median S/N, as shown in Figure
10 of Mooley et al. (2016), we ﬁnd that there is no source
in Mooley et al. (2016) that is as signiﬁcant as this FRB

1 Since the last data point was detected by VLA while other data
points were detected with ATCA, there might be some systematic
errors introduced by cross-calibration between diﬀerent telescopes.

afterglow candidate.
If we change the second point to
0.11 ± 0.02, the fraction of sources as signiﬁcant as the
FRB afterglow candidate is 0.001. This is consistent with
our previous result.

3. TEMPORAL COINCIDENCE PROBABILITY
The existence of an event with a similar STD/hfi
and median S/N to the FRB 150418-transient does
not necessarily interpret the observation. One impor-
tant, intriguing fact is that the radio source was fad-
ing during the span of the 5 ATCA observations (left
panel of Fig.1), which have observational epochs at
t0 + [0.09, 5.9, 7.9, 78.7, 193.4] days after the FRB time
t0, respectively, for the Keane et al. (2016) observation.
Assuming that during 190 days there was only one bright
transient (i.e. there is no variability during the last three
observational epoch), the duty cycle of ﬂares may be es-
timated as ∼ 8 days /190 days ∼ 0.04. the chance of
having the ﬁrst observation to be the brightest point is
P2 ∼ 0.09/190 ∼ 5 × 10−4.
One may argue that the source may be variable all
the time, and that the ﬁrst observation may have missed
even brighter phases at earlier times. In order to examine
these probabilities, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation
using the most conservative approach by assuming that
the source has a variability duty cycle of 100%2. We
assume that the source varies sinusoidally with time, i.e.

f = f0 + Asin(2π

),

t
P

but with the amplitude A varying in diﬀerent periods.
Here f0 is the ﬂux of the quiescent state. Since the pe-
riod P is unknown, we vary it from 2 days to 100 days.
By ﬁxing a particular P, we simulate a mock light curve
which lasts for 500 periods. We allow the amplitude A
to be variable. For each period, it is randomly simulated
based on the STD/hfi distribution in the Ofek et al.
(2011) catalog. For a sinusoidal distribution, one has
A = √2STD, and hfi = f0. In order to be consistent
with the observed FRB afterglow, the STD/hfi distribu-
tion with median S/N = (5 − 6) is used. An example of
a small passage of the simulated light curve is shown in
the left panel of Figure 2.

From each simulated light curve, we randomly pick a t0
time as the epoch of the FRB, and then pick up the ﬂuxes
at the time series t0 + [0.09, 5.9, 7.9, 78.7, 193.4] days as a
simulated detection series. We require that the resulting
light curve should statistically decrease with time with
respect to the ﬁrst point. We simulate 106 FRBs in each
light curve and estimate the fraction of simulated detec-
tion series that satisfy the above criterion. The fraction
as a function of the assumed period is shown in the right
panel of Figure 2.
It can be seen that, the fraction of
the simulated detection series that satisfy the monotonic
criterion P2 is period dependent. In general, the larger
the period is, the less possible to produce a detection se-
ries similar to the FRB 150418 transient. By accounting
for the range of P2 introduced by the period-dependence,
we ﬁnally get P2 = 10−2.9±1.3, with the latest probability
P2,max ∼ 0.14 (corresponding to period P ∼ 23 days).
2 By introducing a smaller duty cycle, our simulations suggest
that the chance probabilities for the temporal coincidence are in-
deed even lower.

2016), while the ﬁrst ﬁve points are original ATCA points (Keane et al. 2016). The radio afterglow light curves of the short GRBs 050724
(green) and 130603B (blue) are also presented for comparison. Right: The relative standard deviation STD/hf i vs. median S/N for our
simulated mock observations (gray dots) compared with the FRB 150418 afterglow candidate (stars) and two short GRBs (ﬁlled circles).
The red star denotes the original ATCA data (Keane et al. 2016), and the orange star also includes the latest VLA data (Williams et al.
2016). The short GRBs 050724 (green) and 130603B (blue) are also shown. For each short GRB, the small circles treat upper limits as
detections assuming that the ﬂuxes are half of the upper limits and the errors are also half of the upper limits. The large circles, on the
other hand, exclude the upper limits from the calculations. The true value is likely between the two circles, as shown as the green and blue
segments.

In reality the variable source is not strictly periodic.
We also tried to simulate light curves with a distribu-
tion of period within each light curve. Both a uni-
form distribution and a Gaussian distribution of P are
tested. The mean value of P2 is slightly larger, but
the scatter becomes smaller, with the largest probabil-
ity P2,max ∼ 0.01.
Combining all the constraints (spatial, ﬂux, and tem-
poral coincidence), the ﬁnal chance probability to have
an unrelated AGN ﬂare to mimic the putative afterglow
of FRB 150418 is

P = NrP1P2,

which is ∼ 10−4.9±1.3 for the original Keane et al. (2016)
data, and is ∼ 10−4.4±1.3 with the inclusion of the latest
VLA data (Williams et al. 2016) (see Table 1). Both are
very small numbers.

4. COMPARISON WITH SHORT GRB RADIO

AFTERGLOWS

Since the putative afterglow of FRB 150418 has a ﬂux
comparable to that of short GRBs (Keane et al. 2016;
Zhang 2016), it is worth comparing the variability prop-
erties of short GRB afterglows with the FRB 150418
transient. There are two SGRBs with at least two ra-
dio afterglow detections. One is GRB 050724 from the
radio afterglow catalog of Chandra & Frail (2012). An-
other one is GRB 130603B, which has two detections
and two upper limits (Fong et al. 2014). Following the
same procedure, we present their STD/hfi and median
S/N in Table 1. Assuming that they fall into one of
the Parkes beams, we calculate the chance probability
of confusing them with an underlying AGN radio ﬂaring

sources in the Ofek et al. (2011) catalog. The afterglow
light curves of the two short GRBs are presented along
with that of FRB 150418 in the left panel of Fig.1 (in
green and blue). Upside down triangles indicate upper
limits.
In the process of estimating STD/hfi and me-
dian S/N for the two short GRBs, we treat the upper
limits in two diﬀerent methods: one is to include them
by assuming that both detection values and the errors
are half of the upper limit values; the other is to ex-
clude the upper limits completely. These two methods
deﬁne a range of STD/hfi and median S/N, which are
marked in the right panel of Fig.1 as segments connected
with two ﬁlled circles. The results with the ﬁrst method
are marked with small circles, and those with the sec-
ond method are marked with large circles. One can see
that GRB 050724 has a more signiﬁcant variability and
a smaller chance probability than FRB 150418. On the
other hand, GRB 130603B is less variable and has a sim-
ilar chance probability to be confused as a ﬂaring source
as FRB 150418. In general, FRB 150418 sits near the two
short GRBs in the STD/hfi - S/N space, suggesting that
the data are not inconsistent with being an FRB / short
GRB afterglow, as suggested by Keane et al. (2016).

5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have statistically examined the probability of hav-
ing a random variable source, such as AGN, following
FRB 150418 by comparing the event with the radio vari-
able sources presented in Ofek et al. (2011). By requir-
ing that the coincident transient should have at least
the same STD/hfi and median S/N values as the FRB
150418 transient and that it should decay starting from
the ﬁrst observation, the combined spatial, ﬂux, and
temporal chance coincidence probability is < 10−4.9±1.3
for Keane et al. (2016) observational data only, and <

10−4.4±1.3 with the VLA point included (Williams et al.
2016). We also show that the event is not inconsistent
with a short GRB radio afterglow (with host contami-
nation). We therefore argue that the event has a low
probability being an unrelated AGN ﬂare, and that the
possibility that the source is the intrinsic afterglow of
FRB 150418 is not ruled out by the current data. Fur-
ther monitoring the source is needed to place more con-
straints on the afterglow and AGN possibilities. If the
source later re-brightens to the level of the ﬁrst two
data points of Keane et al. (2016), then the afterglow
scenario would be ruled out. A smaller variability as
seen by Williams et al. (2016), would not signiﬁcantly
alter the conclusion of this paper, since scintillations
(Hughes et al. 1992; Qian et al. 1995; Goodman 1997)
would explain such ﬂuctuations as long as the emitting
region has a small enough angular size.

Suppose that the ﬁrst two data points following FRB
150418 are indeed the afterglow of the FRB, the existence
of a bright radio host is still puzzling. One may consider
the following possibilities.

(1) First, the host may be related to the star forma-
tion in the host. Assuming that the quiescent radio emis-
sion of the host originates from star formation, the star
formation rate (SFR) estimated with radio emission is
101.7M⊙ yr−1 (Kennicutt & Evans 2012), two orders of
magnitude larger than the upper limit estimated from

Hα emission line (Keane et al. 2016).
It indicates an
inconsistency between the emission line-estimated SFR
and the continuum-estimated SFR. Such a discrepancy
also occasionally seen in SGRB hosts. For example, the
host of GRB 050509B, which is an elliptical galaxy, also
shows no SFR by using emission lines as an indicator,
< 0.1 M⊙ yr−1 (Berger 2009), while the SFR estimated
by UV emission is 16.9 M⊙ yr−1(Savaglio et al. 2009).
Although such a possibility is not ruled out, it is not
favored. Within this picture, the host ﬂux is not ex-
pected to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly.
If the VLA rebright-
ening reported by Williams et al. (2016) is not due to
a mis-calibration between VLA and ATCA, it strongly
disfavors this possibility.

(2) Second, the quiescent radio ﬂux is from an under-
lying low-activity AGN, while the FRB is related to a
compact-star-merger event (Zhang 2016) within the host
galaxy of the AGN. This is not impossible, since the host
galaxy appears as an elliptical galaxy with little star for-
mation, which is consistent with being a host of com-
pact star mergers (Gehrels et al. 2005; Barthelmy et al.
2005; Berger 2014). The probability of having such a
weak AGN host may be low, and is worth investigat-
ing. As an elliptical galaxy with a stellar mass 1011
M⊙ (Keane et al. 2016), the center black hole mass of
the putative FRB host may be estimated using the
MBH − M∗ relation (H¨aring & Rix 2004), which gives

MBH = 108.2M⊙. If the radio quiescent emission is trully
from the central black hole, It indicates a radio luminos-
ity 4.2 × 1039 erg/s. The X-ray luminosity anticipated
from the black hole activity fundamental plane is 1.4
×1043 erg/s, which is smaller than the X-ray upper limit
from Swift (Keane et al. 2016). Although the optical
spectrum of the host disfavors an AGN at the center, it is
supported by the consistency between its radio spectrum
and those of AGNs (Vedantham et al. 2016). It may be
an low luminosity AGN or radio analog to the X-ray
bright Optical galaxy (XBONG) (Yuan & Narayan 2004;
Maiolino et al. 2003). Deep X-ray monitoring might be
the best way to investigate the AGN possibility, and the
origin of the radio quiescent emission of the host. In any
case, the existence of an AGN does not rule out the pos-

5

sibility that the ﬁrst two data points are due to the FRB
150418 afterglow.

(3) The third probability is that both afterglow and
AGN are true (similar to the second possibility), but the
FRB may be related to the AGN itself. However, no vi-
able FRB model has been proposed to be produced in
an AGN environment. One diﬃculty would be the time
scale. Whereas the shortest time scale for a supermas-
sive BH may be hours, the typical FRB duration is at
most milliseconds. More work is needed to explore this
possibility.
