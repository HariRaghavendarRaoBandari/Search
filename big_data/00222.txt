ISOTROPIC GEOMETRY OF GRAPH SURFACES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS

IN ECONOMICS

Muhittin Evren Aydin, Mahmut Ergut

Firat University and Namik Kemal University, Turkey

Abstract. A production function is a mathematical formalization in eco-
nomics which denotes the relations between the output generated by a ﬁrm, an
industry or an economy and the inputs that have been used in obtaining it. In
this paper, we study the product production functions of 2 variables in terms
of the geometry of their associated graph surfaces in the isotropic 3−space I3.
In particular, we derive several classiﬁcation results for the graph surfaces of
product production functions in I3 with constant curvature.

Key words: Production function, return to scale, relative curvature, isotropic

mean curvature, isotropic space.

1 Introduction

In economics, a production function is a non-constant positive function that
species the output of a ﬁrm, an industry, or an entire economy for all combi-
nations of inputs. Explicitly, it is a map of class C∞ which has non-vanishing
ﬁrst derivatives deﬁned by

(cid:26) h : Rn

+ −→ R+, (x1, x2, ..., xn) 7−→ h (x1, x2, ..., xn) ,

+ = {(x1, x2, ..., xn) : xi > 0, i = 1, ..., n} .

Rn

(1.1)

Here h denotes the quantity of output, n is the number of inputs and the vari-
ables are the inputs (such as capital, labor, raw materials etc.). Some interesting
examples of production functions can be found in [18].

In order for the production functions to model as well economic reality, they
are required to get some proporties (see e.g. [5, 22]). One of the most important
of these proporties is the production function f to be homogeneous, i.e. there
exist a real number p such that

h (λx1, λx2, ..., λxn) = λph (x1, x2, ..., xn) , λ ∈ R+.

(1.2)

(1.2) implies when the inputs are multiplied by same factor, the output is mul-
tiplied by some power of the factor.

If p < 1 (resp. p > 1) in (1.2), then the production function is said to have
decreasing (resp. increasing) return to scale. If p = 1, then it is said to have
constant return to scale.

The presence of increasing returns means that a one percent increase in the
usage levels of all inputs would result in a greater than one percent increase in

1

output; the presence of decreasing returns means that it would result in a less
than one percent increase in output. Constant returns to scale is the in-between
case (cf. [8]).

A.D. Vilcu and G.E. Vilcu [26] completely classiﬁed the homogeneous pro-
duction functions with constant proportional marginal rate of substitution. Fur-
ther, the homogeneous production functions have been investigated via their
associated graph hypersurfaces in [6]-[11], [29].

The most famous one among homogeneous production functions is Cobb-
Douglas production function, introduced in 1928 by C. W. Cobb and P. H.
Douglas [12]. In original form, it is given as

Y = bLkC 1−k,

where b presents the total factor productivity, Y the total production, L the
labor input and C the capital input.

The generalized Cobb-Douglas production function of n variables is deﬁned

by

h (x) = Axα1

1 xα2

2 ...xαn

n , x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ Rn

+

where A, α1, α2, ..., αn > 0. We note that h has constant return to scale if and

i=1 αi = 1.

only if Pn

X. Wang, Y. Fu [28] and A.D. Vilcu, G.E. Vilcu [24, 25] classiﬁed the graph
hypersurfaces of the generalized Cobb-Douglas production functions with zero
Gauss-Kronocker and mean curvature.

On the other hand, there are some non-homogeneous production functions,
including the famous Spillman-Mitscherlich and transcendental production func-
tions respectively deﬁned by

(cid:26) h (x) = A [1 − exp (a1x1)] · [1 − exp (a2x2)] · ... · [1 − exp (anxn)] ,
x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ Rn

+, A > 0, ai < 0, i = 1, ..., n

and

(cid:26) h (x) = Axa1
x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ Rn

1 exp (b1x1) · xa2

2 exp (b2x2) · ... · xan
+, A > 0, ai, bi ∈ R, a2

n exp (bnxn) ,
i + b2

i 6= 0, i = 1, ..., n.

Such production functions, including the generalized Cobb-Douglas production
function, belong to a more general class of production functions given by

h (x) =

n

Yj=1

gj (xj) , x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ Rn
+,

where gj is a continuous positive real functions with nonzero ﬁrst derivatives,
j = 1, ..., n. H. Alodan et al.
[1] called these production functions product
production functions. A production function is said to be quasi-product, if it is
of the form

n

h (x) = F 
Yj=1


gj (xj)


, x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ Rn
+,

2

where F, gj are continuous positive real functions with nonzero ﬁrst derivatives,
j = 1, ..., n. A lot of classiﬁcations of the quasi-product and quasi-sum produc-
tion functions can be found in [1]-[4], [14, 27] in terms of the geometry of their
graph hypersurfaces.

B.-Y. Chen, et al [7, 13] investigated the graph hypersurfaces of the pro-
duction models via the isotropic geometry.
In the present paper, we classify
the graph surfaces of product production functions of 2 variables with constant
curvature in the isotropic 3-space I3.

2 Basics on isotropic spaces

For later use, we provide a brief review of isotropic geometry from [7], [19]-[21].
The isotropic 3-space I3 is a Cayley–Klein space deﬁned from a 3-dimensional

projective space P (cid:0)R3(cid:1) with the absolute ﬁgure which is an ordered triple
(ω, f1, f2), where ω is a plane in P (cid:0)R3(cid:1) and f1, f2 are two complex-conjugate
straight lines in ω. The homogeneous coordinates in P(cid:0)R3(cid:1) are introduced in
such a way that the absolute plane ω is given by X0 = 0 and the absolute lines
f1, f2 by X0 = X1 + iX2 = 0, X0 = X1 − iX2 = 0. The intersection point
F (0 : 0 : 0 : 1) of these two lines is called the absolute point. The group of mo-
tions G6 of I3 is a six-parameter group given in the aﬃne coordinates x1 = X1
,
X0
x2 = X2
X0

, x3 = X3
X0

by

(x1, x2, x3) 7−→ (x′1, x′2, x′3) :


x′1 = a + x1 cos φ − x2 sin φ,
x′2 = b + x1 sin φ + x2 cos φ,
x′3 = c + dx1 + ex2 + x3,

(2.1)

where a, b, c, d, e, φ ∈ R. Such aﬃne transformations are called isotropic congru-
ence transformations or i-motions. It is easily seen from (2.1) that i-motions are
indeed composed by an Euclidean motion in the x1x2−plane (i.e. translation
and rotation) and an aﬃne shear transformation in x3−direction.
In general, the following terminology is used for the isotropic spaces. Con-
sider the points x = (x1, x2, x3) and y = (y1, y2, y3) . The projection in z−direction
onto R2, (x1, x2, x3) 7−→ (x1, x2, 0) , is called the top view. In the sequel, many
of metric properties in isotropic geometry (invariants under G6) are Euclidean
invariants in the top view such as the isotropic distance, so-called i-distance.
I-distance of two points x and y is deﬁned as the Euclidean distance of their
top views, i.e.,

kx − yki =vuut

2

Xj=1

(yj − xj )2.

(2.2)

The i-metric is degenerate along the lines in z−direction, and such lines are
called isotropic lines. The plane containing an isotropic line is called an isotropic
plane. Therefore, an isotropic 3−space I3 is the product of the Euclidean
2−space R2 and an isotropic line with a degenerate parabolic distance metric.

3

Let M 2 be a regular surface immersed in I3 which has no isotropic tangent
planes. Such a surface M 2 is said to be admissible and can be parametrized by

r : D ⊆ R2 −→ I3 : (u1, u2) 7−→ (r1 (u1, u2) , r2 (u1, u2) , r3 (u1, u2)) ,

(2.3)

where r1, r2 and r3 are smooth real-valued functions on a domain D ⊆ R2.
Denote g the metric on M 2 induced from I3. The components of the ﬁrst fun-
damental form of M 2 can be calculated via the induced metric g as follows

gij = g(cid:0)rui , ruj(cid:1) , rui =

∂r
∂ui

, i, j ∈ {1, 2} .

The unit normal vector ﬁeld of M 2 is completely isotropic, i.e. (0, 0, 1). Also,
the components of the second fundamental form are (for details, see [20], p.
150-155)

tij =

det(cid:0)ruiuj , ru1 , ru2(cid:1)

pdet (gij )

, ruiuj =

∂ 2r

∂ui∂uj

, i, j ∈ {1, 2} .

(2.4)

Thus the relative curvature (so-called the isotropic curvature or isotropic Gaus-
sian curvature) and the isotropic mean curvature are respectively deﬁned by

K =

det (tij )
det (gij)

, H =

g11t22 − 2g12t12 + g22t11

det (gij)

.

(2.5)

A surface is called isotropic minimal (resp. isotropic ﬂat ) if its isotropic mean
curvature (resp. relative curvature) vanishes.

In particular, if M 2 is a Monge surface in I3 of the form

(u1, u2) 7−→ (u1, u2, h (u1, u2)) ,

then the metric on M 2 induced from I3 is given by g
that M 2 is always a ﬂat space with respect to the induced metric g
Laplacian is given by

1 + du2

= du2

∗

2. This implies
. Thus its

∗

△ =

∂ 2
∂u2
j

.

Xj=1

Also, the matrix of second fundamental form of M 2 becomes the Hessian matrix

function h). Thereby, the formulas in (2.5) reduce to

of h (i.e. the square matrix (cid:0)huiuj(cid:1) of second-order partial derivatives of the
K = det(cid:0)huiuj(cid:1) = hu1u1 hu2u2 − (hu1u2 )2 , H = △h = hu1u1 + hu2u2 .

3 Product production functions

Let us consider the product production function of 2 variables given by

h : R2

+ −→ R+, (x, y) 7−→ h (x, y) = f (x) g (y) ,

where f , g are continuous positive real functions with f ′ (x) = df
g′ (y) = dg

dy 6= 0. The graph surface M 2 corresponding to h is of the form

dx 6= 0 and

r (x, y) = (x, y, h (x, y) = f (x) g (y)) ,

(3.1)

which we call product production surface.

We remark that the surfaces of the form (3.1) are known as factorable sur-
faces or homothetical surfaces in ambient spaces and have been studied in
[15, 17, 23, 30].

The following result provides a complete classiﬁcation of the product pro-

duction surfaces of 2 variables in I3 with constant relative curvature.

Theorem 3.1. Let M 2 be a product production surface given by (3.1) in I3

with constant relative curvature K0.

(A) If K0 = 0, then one of the following occurs:
(A.1) h (x, y) = c1f (x) or h (x, y) = c2g (y) for nonzero constants c1, c2.
(A.2) h is a transcendental production function of 2 variables given by

h (x, y) = A exp (c1x + c2y) ,

where A, c1, c2 are nonzero constants.

(A.3) Up to translations of x and y, h is a Cobb-Douglas production function

of 2 variables with constant return to scale.

(B) If K0 6= 0, then it is negative (K0 < 0) and, up to translations of x and

y, h is a Cobb-Douglas production function of 2 variables given by

h (x, y) = (−K0) xy.

Proof. Assume that M 2 has constant relative curvature K0 in I3. Then, it

follows from (2.6) that

(f ′′g′′) f g − (f ′g′)2 = K0

(3.2)

where f ′ = df

dx and g′ = dg

dy , etc. We divide the proof into two cases:

Case (i) K0 = 0. Then, from (3.2) , both situations, f or g constants, are
solutions for (3.2). This implies the statement (A.1) of the theorem. Now,
let us assume that f and g are non-constant functions. Hence, it follows from
(3.2) that f and g cannot be linear functions. Thus the equation (3.2) can be
rewritten as

f ′′f
(f ′)2 −

(g′)2
g′′g

= 0,

5

which yields

f f ′′
(f ′)2 = λ =

(g′)2
g′′g

(3.3)

for a nonzero constant λ. In order to solve (3.3) we have to distinguish two
situations.

Case (i.1) λ = 1. Then after solving (2.3) we get

f (x) = c1 exp (c2x) and g (y) = c3 exp (c4y) ,

where ci are nonzero constants, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, which gives the the statement (A.2)
of the theorem.

Case (i.2) λ 6= 1. Solving (3.3) yields

f (x) = [(1 − λ) (c1x + d1)]

1

1−λ and g (y) =(cid:20)(cid:18) λ − 1

λ (cid:19) (c2y + d2)(cid:21)

λ

λ−1

for nonzero constants c3, c4 and some constants d1, d2. Up to suitable transla-
tions of x, y, we obtain

h (x, y) = f (x) g (y) = Ax

for A = [c1 (1 − λ)]
theorem.

1

1−λ (cid:2)c2(cid:0) λ−1
λ (cid:1)(cid:3)

λ

λ−1 . This proves the statement (A.3) of the

Case (ii) K0 6= 0. Suppose that f and g are non-linear functions. Hence,

we can rewrite (3.2) as

f f ′′
(f ′)2 −

(g′)2
gg′′

=

K0

(f ′)2 gg′′

.

(3.4)

Diﬀerentiating of (3.4) with respect to y gives

gg′′ !′
−  (g′)2

=

K0

(f ′)2 (cid:18) 1

gg′′(cid:19)′

.

(3.5)

From (3.5) , if

gg′′(cid:19)′
(cid:18) 1

= 0,

i.e. gg′′ is a nonzero constant c in (3.5) , then we get 1
not possible because g is non-linear function. In (3.5) , if

c (cid:16)(g′)2(cid:17)′ = 0, which is

gg′′ !′
  (g′)2

= 0,

6

(3.6)

then (3.5) reduces to

K0

(f ′)2 (cid:18) 1

gg′′(cid:19)′

= 0,

which yields gg′′ = d, d 6= 0. Considering this in (3.6) implies 2
is a contradiction. Thereby we can rewrite (3.5) as

d g′g′′ = 0 and it

gg′′ (cid:19)′
− (cid:18) (g′)2
gg′′(cid:17)′
(cid:16) 1

=

K0

(f ′)2 .

(3.7)

Since f is a non-linear function, the right-side of (3.7) is a function of x. However
the left-side of (3.7) is either a constant or a function of y. Both cases are not
possible.

Now let either f or g be a linear function. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that f is a linear function, i.e. f (x) = c1x + d1, c1 6= 0, d1 ∈ R.
Then we get from (3.2)

g′ =

, K0 < 0.

√−K0

c1

This implies that g is also a linear function, i.e. g (y) =
Thus, up to suitable translations of x and y, we derive

√

−K0
c1

y + d2, d2 ∈ R.

This gives of the statement (B) of the theorem.

h (x, y) =p−K0xy.

Therefore, the proof is completed.

Next classiﬁes the product production surfaces of constant isotropic mean

curvature in I3.

Theorem 3.2. Let M 2 be a product production surface given by (3.1) in I3

with constant isotropic mean curvature H0. Then either

(A)

h (x, y) =

H0
g0

x2 + d1x + d2, (or

H0
f0

y2 + d1y + d2)

for f0, g0 ∈ R − {0} , d1, d2 ∈ R, or
h is a Cobb-Douglas production function of 2 variables given by

(B) M 2 is isotropic minimal, i.e. H0 = 0, and up translations of x and y,

h (x, y) = Axy, A > 0.

Proof. Assume that M 2 has constant isotropic mean curvature H0. Then,

by (2.6) , we get

H0 = f ′′g + f g′′.

(3.8)

7

It follows from (3.8) that when g is a nonzero constant g0 we have

f (x) =

H0
g0

x2 + d1x + d2, d1, d2 ∈ R,

and analogously if f is a nonzero constant f0, we deduce

g (y) =

H0
f0

y2 + d3y + d4, d3, d4 ∈ R,

which proves the statement (A) of the theorem.

Now suppose that f, g are non-constant functions. Then (3.8) can be rewrit-

ten as

f ′′
f

+

g′′
g

=

H0
f g

.

After taking the partial derivative of (3.9) with respect to x, we deduce

f (cid:19)′ f 2
(cid:18) f ′′

f ′

= −H0

1
g

.

(3.9)

(3.10)

The left-side of (3.10) is etiher a constant or a function of x while the other side
is a function of y. This case is only possible when H0 = 0 and

f (cid:19)′
(cid:18) f ′′

= 0.

(3.11)

Similarly, taking the partial derivative of (3.9) with respect to y, we ﬁnd H0 = 0
and

g (cid:19)′
(cid:18) g′′

= 0.

(3.12)

This means that M 2 is isotropic minimal, i.e. H0 = 0. Now let us assume that
f and g are non-linear functions. By solving (3.11) and (3.12) , we derive

f (x) = β1eα1x + β2e−α1x and g (y) = β3eα2y + β 4e−α2y

(3.13)

for nonzero constants αi, βj, i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Substituting (3.13) into
(3.9) gives

α2

1 + α2

2 = 0,

which is not possible. Then the functions f and g are linear and up to transla-
tions x and y, we obtain h (x, y) = Axy, A 6= 0. This gives the proof.

Remark 3.3. For the product production function given by h (x, y) =
f (x) g (y) , we have that f and g are nonconstant functions. Hence, while the
statement (A.1) of Theorem 3.1 and the statement (A) of Theorem 3.2 are cor-
rect in mathematical perspective, in reality such product production functions
do not exist.

8

Now let us consider Spillman-Mitscherlich and transcendental production

functions of 2 variables respectively given by

(cid:26) h (x, y) = A [1 − exp (ax)] · [1 − exp (by)] ,
(x, y) ∈ Rn

+, A > 0, a, b < 0

and

(cid:26) h (x, y) = Axa1 exp (b1x1) · xa2
(x, y) ∈ Rn

+, A > 0, ai, bi ∈ R, a2

2 exp (b2x2) ,

i + b2

i 6= 0, i = 1, 2.

(3.14)

(3.15)

From Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2, we obtain the following results for the

surfaces corresponding to these production functions.

Corollary 3.4. Let h be a Spillman-Mitscherlich production function of 2
variables given by (3.14). Then the corresponding graph surface M 2 of h has
neither constant relative nor constant isotropic curvature in I3.

Corollary 3.5. Let h be a transcendental production function of 2 variables

given by (3.15) and M 2 its associated graph surface in I3. Then:

(A) M 2 has constant relative curvature K0 in I3 if and only if K0 = 0 and

one of the following occurs:

(A.1) α1 = α2 = 0 and b1 6= 0 6= b2, or
(A.2) α1 + α2 = 1, a1 6= 0 6= a2 and b1 = b2 = 0.
(B) M 2 has constant isotropic curvature H0 in I3 if and only if H0 = 0 and

a1 = a2 = 1 b1 = b2 = 0.
