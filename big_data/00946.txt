Abstract.
In 2009, the ﬁrst author introduced a new class of
zeta functions, called ‘distance zeta functions’, associated with ar-
bitrary compact fractal subsets of Euclidean spaces of arbitrary
dimension. It represents a natural, but nontrivial extension of the
theory of ‘geometric zeta functions’ of bounded fractal strings (ini-
tiated also by the ﬁrst author in the early 1990s). In this memoir,
we introduce the class of ‘relative fractal drums’ (or RFDs), which
contains the classes of bounded fractal strings and of compact frac-
tal subsets of Euclidean spaces as special cases. Furthermore, the
associated (relative) distance zeta functions of RFDs, extend (in a
suitable sense) the aforementioned classes of fractal zeta functions.
This notion is very general and ﬂexible, enabling us to view prac-
tically all of the previously studied aspects of the theory of fractal
zeta functions from a uniﬁed perspective as well as to go well be-
yond the previous theory. An unexpected novelty is that the upper
box (or Minkowski) dimension associated with an RFD can also as-
sume negative values (including −∞), which can be interpreted as
a ﬂatness property of the RFD. The abscissa of (absolute) con-
vergence of any relative fractal drum is equal to the relative box
dimension of the RFD. We pay particular attention to the question
of constructing meromorphic extensions of the distance zeta func-
tions of RFDs, as well as to the construction of transcendentally
∞-quasiperiodic RFDs (i.e., roughly, RFDs with inﬁnitely many
quasiperiods, all of which are algebraically independent). We also
describe a class of RFDs (and, in particular, a new class of bounded
sets), called maximal hyperfractals, such that the critical line of
(absolute) convergence consists solely of nonremovable singulari-
ties of the associated relative distance zeta functions. Finally, we
also describe a class of Minkowski measurable RFDs which possess
an inﬁnite sequence of complex dimensions of arbitrary multiplic-
ity m ≥ 1, and even an inﬁnite sequence of essential singularities
along the critical line.

Preface

The purpose of this memoir is to develop the theory of complex dimensions for
arbitrary compact subsets A of Euclidean spaces RN , of arbitrary dimension N ≥ 1.
To this end, in 2009, the ﬁrst author has introduced a new class of zeta functions,
called distance zeta functions ζA of fractal sets A, the poles of which (after ζA has
been suitably meromorphically extended) are deﬁned as the complex dimensions of
A. This notion establishes an important bridge between the geometry of fractal
sets, Number Theory and Complex Analysis.

The development of the higher-dimensional theory of complex dimensions of
fractal sets has led us to the discovery of the tube zeta functions ˜ζA of fractal sets,
which are not only a valuable technical tool, but a natural companion of the distance
zeta functions ζA. Both the distance and tube zeta functions enable us to extend
in a nontrivial way the existing theory of geometric zeta functions ζL of bounded
fractal strings L. An even broader perspective is achieved by introducing the so-
called relative fractal drums (RFDs) (A, Ω) in Euclidean spaces, which extend the
notions of bounded fractal sets in RN , as well as of bounded fractal strings. The
associated relative fractal zeta functions ζA,Ω enable us to consider the theory of
fractal zeta functions from a uniﬁed perspective. An unexpected novelty is that
a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) can have a (naturally deﬁned) Minkowski (or box)
dimension dimB(A, Ω) of negative value (and even of value −∞), or more generally,
that its principal complex dimensions (i.e., the poles of ζA,Ω on the critical line
{Re s = D}, where D = dimB(A, Ω) is the upper Minkowski dimension of (A, Ω))
can have negative real parts.

The residue of a fractal zeta function, computed at the value D of the abscissa
of (absolute) convergence of the zeta function (i.e., at the Minkowski dimension),
is very closely related to the Minkowski content of the corresponding set or RFD.
Furthermore, we also study the quasiperiodicity of relative fractal drums, by using
a classical result from (transcendental) analytic number theory, due to Alan Baker.
Roughly, for any given positive integer n, it is possible to construct a fractal set
with n algebraically independent quasiperiods; as a result, we obtain a transcen-
dentally n-quasiperiodic set. Moreover, we can even construct transcendentally ∞-
quasiperiodic sets, i.e., fractal sets with inﬁnitely many algebraically independent
quasiperiods.

Towards the end of this memoir, special emphasis is given to the construction
of fractal sets A which have principal complex dimensions (i.e., the poles of the
distance zeta function ζA with real part equal to D = dimBA) of any given mul-
tiplicity m ≥ 2 and even with ‘inﬁnite multiplicity’ m = ∞; i.e., in this case, the
principal complex dimensions of A are, in fact, essential singularities of its distance
zeta function ζA.

PREFACE

Finally, we also construct fractal sets A in RN , which we call maximal hyperfrac-
tals, such that the corresponding distance zeta function has the entire critical line
of (absolute) convergence {Re s = D} as the set of its nonremovable singularities.
We conclude this memoir by a discussion of the notion of “fractality”, for-
mulated in terms of the present higher-dimensional theory of complex dimensions.
Furthermore, we illustrate this discussion by means of an RFD suitably associated
with the Cantor graph (or the “devil’s staircase”).

Introduction

1.1. The development of the idea of dimension: from integers to

complex numbers

The development of the mathematical ideas behind the concept of dimension
started in the 19th century, with the need to precisely deﬁne some basic notions like
the ‘line’ and ‘surface’. Its history can be very roughly subdivided into the following
three parts, all of them deeply interlaced: the history of integer dimensions, fractal
dimensions, and complex dimensions.

1.1.1. Integer dimensions. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the no-
tion of ‘dimension’ has been in use exclusively as a nonnegative integer.
It was
rigourously deﬁned in the 19th century, ﬁrst for linear objects, i.e., in the area of
linear algebra (where it was deﬁned as the number of elements of any base of a
given linear space). Soon, several other integer dimensional quantities have been
introduced, in order to study arbitrary subsets of Euclidean spaces (and, more
generally, of topological spaces). These basic dimensional quantities are known as
the small inductive dimension (Menger–Urysohn), the large inductive dimension
(Brouwer– ˇCech) and the covering dimension ( ˇCech–Lebesgue). A history of the
extremely complex subject of integer dimensions appearing in Topology is given in
the survey article [CriJo].

1.1.2. Fractal dimensions. The foundations of the theory of fractal dimen-
sions have already been laid out in the 1920s, in the works of Minkowski, Hausdorﬀ,
Besicovich and Bouligand, by introducing (suitably deﬁned) dimensions which can
assume noninteger (more speciﬁcally, nonnegative real) values, in order to better
understand geometric properties of very general subsets of Euclidean spaces. These
developments resulted in the Hausdorﬀ dimension and the Minkowski dimension
or the Minkowski–Bouligand dimension (also called the box dimension, the notion
that we adopt in this memoir), which have become essential tools of modern Fractal
Geometry.

Many distinguished scholars contributed in various ways to spreading and de-
veloping these ideas, and thereby, in particular, to the introduction of the seemingly
counterintuitive concept of fractal dimension; there are too many of them to name
them all here. (See, for example, [Man, Chapter XI].) In addition, the methods
of Fractal Geometry are today extremely developed and frequently used in various
specialized scientiﬁc ﬁelds, both from the theoretical and applied points of view.
The relevance of this branch of Mathematics can be seen, in particular, in its nu-
merous applications, ranging from the technical and natural sciences to ﬁnance and
economics, and even to the visual arts. Its present vitality is demonstrated by the
existence of several professional research journals dedicated exclusively to the study

1. INTRODUCTION

of problems emerging from Fractal Geometry. An overview of the early history of
Fractal Geometry and the development of its main ideas can be found in [Man].
(See also [Lap10].)

1.1.3. Complex dimensions. The idea of introducing complex dimensions
(more speciﬁcally, of complex numbers as dimensions) as a quantiﬁcation of the
inner (oscillatory) geometric properties of objects called bounded fractal strings
L, has been proposed in the beginning of the 1990s by the ﬁrst author of this
memoir, based in part on earlier work in [Lap1–3, LapPo1–2, LapMa1–2]. Very
roughly, bounded fractal strings can be identiﬁed with certain bounded subsets of
the real line. In order to deﬁne the complex dimensions of a given bounded fractal
string L, one has to assign to it the corresponding (geometric) zeta function ζL.
The ‘complex dimensions’ of bounded fractal strings are then deﬁned as the poles
of a suitable meromorphic extension of the geometric zeta function in question.
The development of the main ideas and results behind the mathematical theory
of complex dimensions of fractal strings can be found in [Lap-vFr3]. (See also
[Lap-vFr1–2].)

It is natural to ask the following question: Is it possible to deﬁne the ‘complex
dimensions’ for any (nonempty) bounded subset A of Euclidean space? In other
words, is there a natural zeta function ζA, such that its poles can be considered as
the ‘complex dimensions’ of a given set A (assuming that a suitable meromorphic
extension of ζA is possible)? The answer to this question has been obtained by the
ﬁrst author in 2009, by introducing a class of distance zeta functions ζA, as we call
them in this memoir.

As the result of a collaboration between the authors of this memoir, initiated by
the ﬁrst author in 2009, it soon became clear that the notion of ‘complex dimensions’
can be introduced not only for bounded subsets of Euclidean spaces, but even for
much more general geometric objects, denoted by (A, Ω), which we call relative
fractal drums (RFDs). (An example of relative fractal drum is given by (∂Ω, Ω),
where Ω is a bounded open subset of some Euclidean space RN , with N ≥ 1, while
∂Ω is its topological boundary. The special case when N = 1 precisely corresponds
to a bounded fractal string.) The study of the complex dimensions of relative
fractal drums is the main goal of the present memoir. The ﬂexibility of this notion,
as well as of the corresponding notion of relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω, has
enabled us to view the existing theory of complex dimensions of fractal strings (and
their generalizations to fractal sprays) from a uniﬁed perspective and to extend it
beyond recognition. An unexpected novelty was the possibility for the relative
Minkowski dimensions of some classes of relative fractal drums to take negative
values (including the value −∞).
We should mention that the set of complex dimensions of a given RFD (and,
in particular, of a given bounded set of RN ) is always a discrete subset of C, and
hence, consists of a (ﬁnite or countable) sequence of complex numbers, with ﬁnite
multiplicities (as poles of the corresponding fractal zeta functions). In the future,
we may extend this notion to also include the possible essential singularities of
the corresponding fractal zeta functions.
Indeed, in this memoir, we construct
fractal sets and RFDs whose fractal zeta functions have inﬁnitely many essential
singularities.

The theory of complex dimensions of relative fractal drums, developed in this
memoir, provides a useful bridge between Fractal Geometry, Number Theory and

1.2. RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS AND THEIR DISTANCE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Complex Analysis. This theory is extensively developed in [LapRaˇZu1–8], as well
as in the present memoir, but nevertheless is far from being completed.
It has
brought to light numerous interesting questions and new challenging problems for
further research; see, especially, [LapRaˇZu1, Chapter 6] and [LapRaˇZu6, §8].

1.2. Relative fractal drums and their distance zeta functions

In 2009, the ﬁrst author has introduced a new class of zeta functions ζA, called
‘distance zeta functions’, associated with arbitrary compact subsets A of a given
Euclidean space RN of arbitrary dimension N . More speciﬁcally, the distance zeta
function ζA of a bounded set A ⊂ RN is deﬁned by
(1.2.1)

d(x, A)s−N dx,

ζA(s) :=ZAδ

for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large, where δ is a ﬁxed positive real number and
Aδ is the Euclidean δ-neighborhood of A. (Here, d(x, A) := inf{|x − a| : a ∈ A}
denotes the Euclidean distance from x to A and the integral is understood in the
sense of Lebesgue and is therefore absolutely convergent.) They have been studied
in [LapRaˇZu2], as well as in the research monograph [LapRaˇZu1, Chapter 2].

We extend the class of distance zeta functions from a class of compact sets to
a new class of objects that we call ‘relative fractal drums’ (RFDs); see Deﬁnition
1.2 below. This enables us to provide a uniﬁed approach to the study of fractal
zeta functions. An unexpected novelty is that RFDs allow negative upper box
(or Minkowski) dimension (deﬁned by (1.4.3) below), or even equal to −∞; see
Proposition 2.14 below.

Definition 1.1. Let Ω be an open subset of RN , possibly unbounded, but of
ﬁnite N -dimensional Lebesgue measure. Assume that A is a (nonempty) subset of
RN such that

(1.2.2)

there exists δ > 0 such that Ω ⊆ Aδ.

We then say that the ordered pair (A, Ω) is a relative fractal drum (or an RFD, in
short) in RN .

We stress that when working with an RFD (A, Ω), we always assume that both

A and Ω are nonempty.

Relative fractal drums represent a natural extension of the following classes of

objects simultaneously:

(a) The class STRb of bounded fractal strings L := (ℓj)j∈N; indeed, for any given

bounded fractal string1 L := (ℓj)j∈N, we can deﬁne a disjoint union
(1.2.3)

Ω :=

Ij

∞[j=1

of open intervals Ij such that |Ij| = ℓj for each j ≥ 1, and A := ∂Ω; then L
can be identiﬁed with any such RFD (∂Ω, Ω); the set Ω is referred to as a geo-
metric realization of the bounded fractal string L; using this identiﬁcation, we can
1A bounded fractal string L := (ℓj )j∈N is deﬁned as the nonincreasing sequence of positive

real numbers (ℓj)j∈N such that P∞

j=1 ℓj < ∞; see [Lap-vFr3].

1. INTRODUCTION

write L = (∂Ω, Ω); it is sometimes convenient to deal with the canonical geometric
representation of L, deﬁned by
(1.2.4)

AL :=naj :=Xk≥j

ℓk : j ∈ No,
∞[j=1

and in this case, the set

(1.2.5)

is obviously a geometric realization of L, which we call the canonical geometric
realization of L;

(b) The class COM(RN ) of compact fractal sets A in Euclidean space RN , by

identifying A with the corresponding RFD (A, Aδ), for any ﬁxed δ > 0.

Moreover, denoting by RFD(RN ) the family of all RFDs in RN , we have the

following natural inclusions, for any N ≥ 1:

Here, any bounded fractal string L := (ℓj)j∈N can be identiﬁed with the compact

STRb ⊂ COM(RN ) ⊂ RFD(RN ).
set A ⊂ R, where A := {aj =P∞k=j ℓk : j ∈ N} ⊂ R.

We now introduce the main deﬁnition of this memoir.

Definition 1.2. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum (or an RFD) in RN .
The distance zeta function ζA,Ω of the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) (or the relative
distance zeta function of the RFD (A, Ω)) is deﬁned by

(1.2.7)

ζA,Ω(s) :=ZΩ

d(x, A)s−N dx,

for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large.

The family of relative distance zeta functions represents a natural extension of

the following classes of fractal zeta functions:

(a) The class of geometric zeta functions ζL, associated with bounded fractal

strings L := (ℓj)j∈N and deﬁned (for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large) by

(1.2.8)

ζL(s) :=

ℓs
j

∞Xj=1

(it has been extensively studied in the research monograph [Lap-vFr3], by the ﬁrst
author and van Frankenhuijsen, as well as in the relevant references therein); more
precisely, we show that

(1.2.9)
for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large, where Ω is any geometric realization of L,
described in (a), appearing immediately after Deﬁnition 1.1.

ζL(s) = s2s−1ζ∂Ω,Ω(s)

(b) The class of distance zeta functions ζA associated with compact fractal

subsets A of Euclidean spaces, deﬁned by (1.2.1).

1.3. OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN RESULTS OF THIS MEMOIR

5

We point out that some of the results of this memoir (especially in §2.1) can

be viewed in the context of very general convolution-type integrals of the form

(1.2.10)

f (s, t) dµ(t),

H(s) =ZE

about which we cite the following well-known result. We shall need it in the proofs
of Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.12 below.

Theorem 1.3. Let V be an open set in C (or even in Cn). Furthermore, let
(E,B(E), µ) be a measure space, where E is a locally compact metrizable space,
B(E) is the Borel σ-algebra of E, and µ is a positive or complex (local, i.e., locally
bounded) measure, with associated total variation measure denoted by |µ|. Assume
that a function f : V × E → C is given, satisfying the following three conditions:

(1) f (· , t) is holomorphic for |µ|-a.e. t ∈ E,
(2) f (s, · ) is µ-measurable for all s ∈ V , and
(3) a suitable growth property is fulﬁlled by f : for every compact subset K of
V , there exists gK ∈ L1(|µ|) such that |f (s, t)| ≤ gK(t), for all s ∈ V and |µ|-a.e.
t ∈ K.
Then, the function H deﬁned by (1.2.10) is holomorphic on V . Moreover, one can
interchange the derivative and the integral. (The problem of complex diﬀerentiating
under the integral sign is discussed, for example, in [Mattn].) More precisely, for
every s ∈ V and every k ∈ N, we have
(1.2.11)

F (k)(s) =ZE

∂k
∂sk f (s, t) dµ(t).

Remark 1.4. According to [Mattn] and as is well known, if conditions (1) and
(2) from Theorem 1.3 are satisﬁed, then condition (3) is equivalent to the following
condition, which is generally slightly easier to verify in practice:

(3′)RE |f (· , t)|d|µ|(t) is locally bounded; that is, for each ﬁxed s0 ∈ V , there

exists δ > 0 such that

(1.2.12)

s∈V,|s−s0|<δZE |f (s, t)|d|µ|(t) < ∞.

sup

In other words, we can replace condition (3) with condition (3′) in the statement
of Theorem 1.3. (This is the case because the notion of holomorphicity is local.)

1.3. Overview of the main results of this memoir

We note that the notion of complex dimensions of a relative fractal drum (RFD),
necessary for a clearer understanding of this overview, is introduced in Deﬁnition
1.6 below. The deﬁnitions of the relative Minkowski content and of the relative box
(or, more accurately, Minkowski) dimension can be found in Equations (1.4.1) and
(1.4.2) below, respectively.

Overview of Chapter 2. The main result of §2.1 is contained in parts (a)
and (b) of Theorem 2.1, according to which the abscissa of (absolute) convergence
D(ζA,Ω) of the distance zeta function ζA,Ω of any RFD (A, Ω) is equal to the up-
per box (i.e., Minkowski) dimension dimB(A, Ω) of the RFD. Part (c) of the same
theorem provides some mild conditions under which the value of D := dimB(A, Ω)

6

1. INTRODUCTION

(assuming that dimB(A, Ω) exists) is a singularity of the relative distance zeta func-
tion ζA,Ω, and therefore also coincides with the abscissa of holomorphic continuation
of the distance zeta function of the RFD.

Theorem 2.2 shows that for a nondegenerate RFD (A, Ω) and provided ζA,Ω
possesses a meromophic extension to an open connected neighborhood of D :=
dimB A < N , the residue of ζA,Ω evaluated at D always lies (up to the multiplicative
constant (N − D)) between the lower and the upper D-dimensional Minkowski
contents of the RFD. In particular, if the RFD is Minkowski measurable, then
the residue res(ζA,Ω, D) is, up to the same multiplicative constant, equal to the
D-dimensional Minkowski content of the RFD.

In Proposition 2.10 of §2.2, we show that if there is at least one point a ∈ A∩ Ω
at which the RFD (A, Ω) satisﬁes a suitable cone property with respect to Ω (see
Deﬁnition 2.6), then D(ζA,Ω) ≥ 0. In general, however, the value of D(ζA,Ω) (i.e., of
the upper relative box dimension dimB(A, Ω)), can take on any prescribed negative
value (see Proposition 2.12), and even the value −∞ (see Corollary 2.14).
In §2.3, dealing with the scaling property of the relative distance zeta functions,
the main result is stated in Theorem 2.16. It has important applications to the
study of self-similar sprays (or tilings). Corollary 2.17 states an interesting scaling
property of the residues of relative distance zeta functions, evaluated at their sim-
ple poles; see Equation (2.3.2). The countable additivity of the relative distance
zeta function with respect to the disjoint union of RFDs (a notion introduced in
Deﬁnition 2.18) is established in Theorem 2.19.

In §2.4, we introduce the notion of the relative tube zeta function (see Equa-
tion (2.4.1)), which is closely related to the relative distance zeta function (see the
functional equation (2.4.2) connecting these two fractal zeta functions). Equation
(2.4.5) in Proposition 2.21 connects the residues (evaluated at any visible complex
dimension) of the relative tube and distance functions. In Example 2.22, we cal-
culate (via a direct computation) the complex dimensions of the torus RFD. Much
more generally, in Proposition 2.23, we calculate the distance zeta function (and the
complex dimensions) of the boundary of any (nonempty) compact set C of positive
reach (and, in particular, of any compact convex subset of RN ); we also obtain at
the same time a similar result for the boundary of a smooth compact submanifold
of RN (thereby signiﬁcantly extending the results of the aforementioned Example
2.22).

The important problem of the existence and construction of meromorphic ex-
tensions of some classes of relative (tube and distance) zeta functions is studied in
§2.5. It is treated in Theorem 2.24 for a class of Minkowski measurable RFDs, and
in Theorem 2.25 for a class of Minkowski nonmeasurable (but Minkowski nonde-
generate) RFDs.

The main result of §2.6 is stated in Theorem 2.40, dealing with the construction
of ∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drums, a notion introduced in Deﬁnition 2.37. Its
proof makes an essential use of suitable families of generalized Cantor sets C(m,a)
with two parameters m and a, introduced in Deﬁnition 2.28, and of some of their
properties listed in Proposition 2.29. Theorem 2.40 can be considered as a fractal
set-theoretic interpretation of Baker’s theorem from transcendental number the-
ory (see Theorem 2.30). It provides an explicit construction of a transcendentally
∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drum. In particular, this RFD possesses inﬁnitely

1.3. OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN RESULTS OF THIS MEMOIR

7

many algebraically incommensurable quasiperiods. In Deﬁnition 2.38, we also in-
troduce the new notions of hyperfractal RFDs, as well as of strong hyperfractals and
of maximal hyperfractals. It turns out that the relative fractal drums constructed in
Theorem 2.40 are not only ∞-quasiperiodic, but are also maximally hyperfractal.
Accordingly, the critical line {Re s = D}, where D := dimB(A, Ω), consists solely
of nonremovable singularities of the associated fractal zeta function; a fortiori, the
distance and tube zeta functions of the RFD cannot be meromorphically extended
beyond this vertical line.

The scaling property of relative tube zeta functions is provided in Proposition
2.42. This result is analogous to the one obtained for relative distance zeta functions
in Theorem 2.16.

Overview of Chapter 3. This chapter deals with the problem of embeddings
of RFDs into higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Theorem 3.3 of §3.1 shows that
the notion of complex dimensions of fractal sets does not depend on the dimension
of the ambient space. In Theorem 3.10 of §3.2, an analogous result is obtained for
general RFDs. An important role in the accompanying computations is played by
the gamma function, the Euler beta function, as well as by the Mellin zeta function
of an RFD, introduced in Equation (3.2.19).
In Example 3.15, we apply these
results in order to calculate the complex dimensions of the Cantor dust.

Overview of Chapter 4. In this chapter, we study relative fractal sprays in
RN , introduced in Deﬁnition 4.1 of §4.1. The main result is given in Theorem 4.6,
which deals with the distance zeta function of relative fractal sprays.
In §4.2, we study the relative Sierpi´nski sprays and their complex dimensions.
Example 4.12 deals with the relative Sierpi´nski gasket, while Example 4.14 deals
with the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFDs, for any N ≥ 2. Furthermore,
Example 4.15 deals with the relative Sierpi´nski carpet, while Example 4.17 deals
with the Sierpi´nski N -carpet, for any N ≥ 2. Interesting new phenomena occur in
this context, which are discussed throughout §4.2.
In Deﬁnition 4.18 of §4.3, we recall (and extend to RFDs) the notion of self-
similar sprays (or tilings), deﬁned by a suitable ratio list of ﬁnitely many real
numbers in (0, 1).

Theorem 4.21 provides an explicit form for the distance zeta function of a self-
similar spray, which can be found in Equation (4.3.12). The results obtained here
are illustrated by the new examples of the 1/2-square fractal and of the 1/3-square
fractal, discussed in Example 4.23 and in Example 4.24, respectively.

In §4.4, we describe a constructive method for generating principal complex
dimensions2 of relative fractal drums of any prescribed multiplicity m ≥ 2, includ-
ing inﬁnite multiplicity. (The latter case where m = ∞ corresponds to essential
singularities of the associated fractal zeta function.) In Example 4.26, we provide
the construction of the m-th order a-string, while we deﬁne the m-th order Cantor
string in Equation (4.4.5).
In Examples 4.28 and 4.29, we construct Minkowski
measurable RFDs which possess inﬁnitely many principal complex dimensions of
arbitrary multiplicity m, with m ≥ 2 and even with m = ∞ (i.e., corresponding to
essential singularities).

2The principal complex dimensions of an RFD are the poles of the associated fractal (i.e.,
distance or tube) zeta function with maximal real part D, where D is both the abscissa of (ab-
solute) convergence of the zeta function and the (relative) Minkowski dimension of the RFD; see
Deﬁnition 1.6 and part (b) of Theorem 2.1 below.

1. INTRODUCTION

Overview of Chapter 5. This chapter is dedicated to the discussion of the
notion of fractality (of RFDs), and its intimate relationship with the notion of the
complex dimensions of RFDs. In §5.1, fractal and subcritically fractal RFDs are
discussed. These notions are illustrated in §5.2 in the case of the Cantor graph
RFD.

1.4. Notation

In the sequel, an important role is played by the deﬁnition of the upper and
lower Minkowski contents of RFDs and of the upper and lower box (or Minkowski)
dimensions of RFDs. We shall follow the deﬁnitions introduced by the third author
in [ˇZu2], but with an essential diﬀerence: the parameter r appearing below can be
any real number, and not just a nonnegative real number. (See Remark 1.5 below.)
Hence, for a given parameter r ∈ R, we deﬁne the r-dimensional upper and lower
Minkowski contents of an RFD (A, Ω) in RN as follows:3

(1.4.1)

M∗r(A, Ω) := lim sup
t→0+

|At ∩ Ω|
tN−r

, Mr

∗(A, Ω) := lim inf
t→0+

|At ∩ Ω|
tN−r

.

We also call them the relative upper Minkowski content and lower Minkowski con-
tent of (A, Ω), respectively. They represent a natural extension of the corresponding
notions of upper and lower Minkowski contents of bounded sets in RN , introduced
by Federer in [Fed2].

As usual, we then deﬁne the upper box dimension of the RFD (A, Ω) by

(1.4.2)

dimB(A, Ω) := inf{r ∈ R : M∗r(A, Ω) = 0}

= sup{r ∈ R : M∗r(A, Ω) = +∞},

as well as the lower box dimension of (A, Ω) by
dimB(A, Ω) := inf{r ∈ R : Mr
= sup{r ∈ R : Mr

(1.4.3)

∗(A, Ω) = 0}
∗(A, Ω) = +∞}.

We refer to dimB(A, Ω) and dimB(A, Ω) as the relative upper and lower box (or
Minkowski) dimension of (A, Ω), respectively. The novelty here is that, contrary to
the usual upper and lower box dimensions, the relative upper and lower Minkowski
dimensions can attain negative values as well, and even −∞. More speciﬁcally, it
is easy to see that

−∞ ≤ dimB(A, Ω) ≤ dimB(A, Ω) ≤ N.

If dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Ω), then the common value is denoted by dimB(A, Ω)
and we call it the box (or Minkowski) dimension of the RFD (A, Ω), or just the
relative box (i.e., Minkowski) dimension.4

If there exists D ∈ R such that 0 < MD

∗ (A, Ω) ≤ M∗D(A, Ω) < ∞, then we
say that the RFD (A, Ω) is Minkowski nondegenerate. Clearly, in this case we have
that D = dimB(A, Ω).

denoted by Mr(A, Ω).

If for some r ∈ R, we have M∗r(A, Ω) = Mr

∗(A, Ω), the common value is
If for some D ∈ R, MD(A, Ω) exists and MD(A, Ω) ∈
3For a given measurable set E ⊂ RN , its N -dimensional Lebesgue measure is denoted by

|E| = |E|N .

4We caution the reader, however, that unlike in the standard case of bounded subsets of RN ,
the notion of relative Minkowski dimension of an RFD has not yet been given a suitable geometric
interpretation in terms of “box counting”.

(0, +∞), then we say that the RFD (A, Ω) is Minkowski measurable. Clearly, in
this case, the dimension of (A, Ω) exists and we have D = dimB(A, Ω).
For example, if the sets A and Ω are a positive distance apart (i.e., inf{|x− y| :
x ∈ A, y ∈ Ω} > 0), then it is easy to see that dimB(A, Ω) = −∞. Indeed, since
|At ∩ Ω| = 0 for all suﬃciently small t > 0, we have that Mr(A, Ω) = 0 for all
r ∈ R. A class of nontrivial examples for which −∞ < dimB(A, Ω) < 0 can be
found in Proposition 2.12.
In the case when Ω := Aδ, where A si a bounded subset of RN and δ is a
ﬁxed positive real number, we obtain the usual (nonrelative) values of box (or
i.e., dimBA := dimB(A, Aδ), dimBA := dimB(A,Aδ),
Minkowski) dimensions,
dimB A := dimB(A, Aδ), which are all nonnegative in this case, as well as the
values of the usual Minkowski contents of A; that is, Mr∗(A) := Mr∗(A, Aδ),
Mr
∗(A, Aδ), Mr(A) := Mr(A, Aδ), for any r ≥ 0. It is easy to see that
these values do not depend on the choice of δ > 0.

∗(A) := Mr

Remark 1.5. These deﬁnitions extend to a general RFD the deﬁnitions used
in [Lap1] for an ordinary fractal drum (i.e., a drum with fractal boundary) in the
case of Dirichlet boundary conditions; see also [Lap-vFr2, §12.5] and the relevant
references therein, including [Brocar, Lap2–3]). We then have (A, Ω) = (∂Ω, Ω),
where Ω is a (nonempty) bounded open subset of RN ;
it follows at once that
D := D(ζ∂Ω,Ω) ≥ 0. In fact, we always have that D ∈ [N − 1, N ]; see [Lap1]. The
special case when N = 1 corresponds to bounded fractal strings, for which we must
have that D ∈ [0, 1]; see, for example, [Lap1–3, LapPo1–2, LapMa1–2, HeLap,
LapLu–vFr1–2].

In the sequel, we use the following notation. Given α ∈ R ∪ ±∞, we denote,
for example, the open right half-plane {s ∈ C : Re s > α} by {Re s > α}, with
the obvious convention if α = ±∞; namely, for α = +∞, we obtain the empty set
and for α = +∞, we have all of C. Moreover, if α ∈ R, we denote the vertical line
{s ∈ C : Re s = α} by {Re s = α}.

We also let N := {1, 2, 3 . . .} and N0 := N ∪ {0} = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. The logarithm
of a positive real number x with base a > 0 is denoted by loga x; i.e., y = loga x ⇔
x = ay. Furthermore, log x := loge x is the natural logarithm of x; i.e., y = log x
⇔ x = ey.
Let f (s) :=RE ϕ(x)sdµ(x) be a tamed generalized Dirichlet-type integral (DTI),
in the sense of [LapRaˇZu2, Deﬁnition 2.12]; that is, ϕ ≥ 0 |µ|-a.e. on E and ϕ is
essentially |µ|-bounded on E, where |µ| is the total variation of the local complex
or positive measure on the locally compact space E. Then, we denote by D(f ) the
abscissa of (absolute) convergence of f ; i.e., D(f ) ∈ [−∞,∞]) is the inﬁmum of all
α ∈ R such that ϕα (or, equivalently, ϕ(x)Re s, with α := Re s) is |µ|-integrable.
If D(f ) ∈ R, the corresponding vertical line {Re s = D(f )} in the complex plane
is called the critical line of f . Furthermore, we denote by Dmer(f ) the abscissa
of meromorphic continuation of f (i.e., Dmer(f ) ∈ [−∞,∞] is the inﬁmum of all
α ∈ R such that f possesses a meromorphic extension to the open right half-plane
{Re s > α}). We deﬁne Dhol(f ), the abscissa of holomorphic continuation of f ,
in exactly the same way as for Dmer(f ), except for “meromorphic” replaced by

10

1. INTRODUCTION

“holomorphic”.5 In general, for any tamed DTI f , we have that
− ∞ ≤ Dmer(f ) ≤ Dhol(f ) ≤ D(f ) ≤ +∞.

(1.4.4)
(See [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem A.2] for the next to last inequality, and [LapRaˇZu1,
Appendix A] for the general theory of tamed DTIs.)

In order to be able to deﬁne the key notions of complex dimensions and of
principal complex dimensions (see Equation (2.1.4) in Chapter 2 below), we assume
that the function f has the property that it can be extended to a meromorphic
function deﬁned on G ⊆ C, where G is an open and connected neighborhood of the
window W deﬁned by

W = {s ∈ C : Re s ≥ S(Im s)}.

Here, the function S : R → (−∞, D(ζA)], called the screen, is assumed to be
Lipschitz continuous. Note that if f := ζA,Ω, then the closed set W contains
the critical line {Re s = D(ζA,Ω)}; in fact, it also contains the closed half-plane
{Re s ≥ D(ζA,Ω)}.

Definition 1.6 (Complex dimensions of an RFD). The set of poles of f located
in a window W containing the critical line {Re s = D(f )} is denoted by P(f, W ).
When the window W is known, or when W := C, we often use the shorter no-
tation P(f ) instead. If f := ζA,Ω and ζA,Ω can be meromorphically extended to
a connected open subset containing the closed right half-plane {Re s ≥ D(ζA,Ω)},
the multiset of poles (i.e., we also take the multiplicities of the poles into account)
is called the multiset of (visible) complex dimensions of (A, Ω). The multiset of
complex dimensions on the critical line of ζA,Ω is called the multiset of principal
complex dimensions of (A, Ω). This multiset is independent of the choice of δ, as
well as of the meromorphic extension of ζ. We note that analogous deﬁnitions will
be used in the case of the relative tube zeta function ˜ζA,Ω, introduced in Equation
(2.4.1) below, instead of the relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω.

If Ω is a given subset of RN , its closure and boundary are denoted by Ω and

∂Ω respectively.

For two given sequences of positive numbers (ak)k≥1 and (bk)k≥1 we write
ak ∼ bk as k → ∞ if limk→∞ ak/bk = 1. Analogosly, if a(· ) and b(· ) are two
real-valued functions deﬁned on an open interval (0, t0), we write a(t) ∼ b(t) as
t → 0+ if limt→0+ a(t)/b(t) = 1.
We shall also need the relation ∼ between Dirichlet-type integral functions
(DTIs) and meromorphic functions (that is, f ∼ g, where f is a DTI and g is a
meromorphic function) in the sense of [LapRaˇZu2, Deﬁnition 2.22], which we now
brieﬂy recall.

Definition 1.7. Let f and g be tamed Dirichlet-type integrals, both admitting
a (necessarily unique) meromorphic extension to an open connected subset U of C
which contains the closed right half-plane {Re s ≥ D(f )}. Then, the function f is
said to be equivalent to g, and we write f ∼ g, if D(f ) = D(g) (and this common
value is a real number) and furthermore, the sets of poles of f and g, located on
the common critical line {Re s = D(f )}, coincide. Here, the multiplicities of the
5Note that Dmer(f ) and Dhol(f ) can be deﬁned for any given meromorphic function f on
a domain U of C, whereas D(f ) is only well deﬁned if f is a tamed DTI. (See [LapRaˇZu2] or
[LapRaˇZu1, Appendix A].)

poles should be taken into account. In other words, we view the set of principal

Basic properties of relative distance and tube zeta

functions

2.1. Holomorphicity of relative distance zeta functions

In the sequel, we denote by D(ζA,Ω) the abscissa of (absolute) convergence of a
given relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω. It is clear that D(ζA,Ω) ∈ [−∞, N ]. Re-
call from the discussion in Chapter 1 that an analogous deﬁnition can be introduced
for much more general, tamed Dirichlet-type integrals, introduced in [LapRaˇZu2],
as well as in the monograph [LapRaˇZu1, especially in Appendix A].

Some of the basic properties of distance zeta functions of RFDs are listed in

the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN . Then the following

properties hold:

(a) The relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω is holomorphic in the half-plane

{Re s > dimB(A, Ω)}, and for those same values of s, we have
d(x, A)s−N log d(x, A) dx.

ζ′A,Ω(s) =ZΩ

(b) The lower bound on the (absolute) convergence region {Re s > dimB(A, Ω)}

of the relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω is optimal. In other words,

(2.1.1)

D(ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω).

(c) If D := dimB(A, Ω) exists, D < N and MD

∗ (A, Ω) > 0, then ζA,Ω(s) → +∞
as s ∈ R converges to D from the right. Hence, under these assumptions, we have
that1

(2.1.2)

D(ζA,Ω) = Dhol(ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω).

We omit the proof since it follows the same steps as in the case when Ω := Aδ
(that is, as in the case of a bounded set A); see [LapRaˇZu2, Theorem 2.5]. In
the proof of part (a) of Theorem 2.1, we need the following result. For any relative
fractal drum (A, Ω) in RN , we have that

(2.1.3)

γ < N − dimB(A, Ω)

d(x, A)−γdx < ∞.

=⇒ ZΩ

sion preceding Equation (1.4.4) above.

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

In the case when Ω = Aδ, where δ is a positive real number, this implication reduces
to the Harvey–Polking result (see [HarvPo]) since in that case, dimB(A, Aδ) =
dimBA. We note that the technical condition (1.2.2) on the RFD (A, Ω) from Def-
inition 1.1 is needed in order that the integrals appearing during the computation
of ζA,Ω are well deﬁned for Re s large enough.

It is clear that the function ζA,Ω is a tamed generalized Dirichlet-type integral
in the sense of [LapRaˇZu2, Deﬁnition 2.12]. If the RFD (A, Ω) is such that the
corresponding relative zeta function ζA,Ω can be meromorphically extended to an
open, connected window W containing the critical line {Re s = D(ζA,Ω)}, then the
poles of ζA,Ω located on the critical line are called the principal complex dimensions
of the RFD (A, Ω). The corresponding multiset of complex dimensions of the RFD
(A, Ω) is denoted by dimP C (A, Ω). In other words,

(2.1.4)

dimP C (A, Ω) := P(ζA,Ω, W ) ∩ {Re s = D(ζA,Ω)}.

It is easy to see that the multiset dimP C (A, Ω) does not depend on the choice of
window W . If A is a bounded subset of RN and δ a ﬁxed positive real number, the
multiset of principal complex dimensions of A is deﬁned by

(2.1.5)

dimP C A := dimP C (A, Aδ),

and this multiset does not depend on the choice of δ > 0.

Analogously, for any bounded fractal string L for which D := dimBL > 0, we

deﬁne the multiset of principal complex dimensions of L by
(2.1.6)

dimP C L := dimP C (∂Ω, Ω),

where Ω is any geometric realization of the fractal string L; see Equation (1.2.9)
which connects the standard geometric zeta function ζL with the relative distance
zeta function ζ∂Ω,Ω. It is clear that the multiset dimP C (∂Ω, Ω) does not depend on
the choice of the geometric realization Ω, because the same is true for the relative
distance zeta function ζ∂Ω,Ω.

In light of [LapRaˇZu2, Theorem 3.3], we have the following result.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that (A, Ω) is a Minkowski nondegenerate RFD in RN ,
∗ (A, Ω) ≤ M∗D(A, Ω) < ∞ (in particular, dimB(A, Ω) = D), and
that is, 0 < MD
D < N . If ζA,Ω can be meromorphically continued to a connected open neighborhood
of s = D, then D is necessarily a simple pole of ζA,Ω, and

(2.1.7)

(N − D)MD

∗ (A, Ω) ≤ res(ζA,Ω, D) ≤ (N − D)M∗D(A, Ω).

Furthermore, if (A, Ω) is Minkowski measurable, then

(2.1.8)

res(ζA,Ω, D) = (N − D)MD(A, Ω).

In the following example, we compute the relative distance zeta function of an

open ball in RN with respect to its boundary.

Example 2.3. Let Ω := BR(0) be the open ball in RN of radius R and let
A = ∂Ω be the boundary of Ω, i.e., the (N − 1)-dimensional sphere of radius R.
Then, introducing the new variable ρ = R − r and letting ωN := |B1(0)|N , the

extended to the whole complex plane and is given by

It follows that ζA,Ω can be meromorphically

Therefore, we have that

Furthermore,

(2.1.11)

dimB(A, Ω) = D(ζA,Ω) = N − 1,

P(ζA,Ω) = {0, 1, . . . , N − 1} and

dimP C (A, Ω) = {N − 1}.

res(ζA,Ω, j) = (−1)N−j−1N ωN(cid:18)N − 1

for j = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. As a special case of (2.1.11), for j = D := N − 1 we obtain
that

(2.1.12)

res(ζA,Ω, D) = N ωN RN−1 = MD(A, Ω) = (N − D)MD(A, Ω).

(This is a very special case of Equation (2.1.8) appearing in Theorem 2.2 above.)
The second to last equality in (2.1.12) follows from the following direct computation
(with D := N − 1):

(2.1.13)

Furthermore, recall that HD(A) = HN−1(∂BR(0)) = N ωN RN−1, where HN−1 is
the (N − 1)-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure. Hence, MD(A, Ω) = HD(A).

Remark 2.4. We note that the usual notions of distance and tube zeta func-
tions, ζA and ˜ζA, associated with a bounded subset A of RN (see [LapRaˇZu1–3]),
can be recovered by considering the RFD (A, Aδ), for some δ > 0:

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Here, ˜ζA,Aδ is the relative tube zeta function of the RFD (A, Aδ), as deﬁned in
Equation (2.4.1) of §2.4 below.

2.2. Cone property of relative fractal drums

We introduce the cone property of a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) at a prescribed
point, in order to show that the abscissa of convergence D(ζA,Ω) of the associated
relative zeta function ζA,Ω be nonnegative. The main result of this section is stated
in Proposition 2.10. We also construct a class of nontrivial RFDs for which the
relative box dimension is an arbitrary negative number (see Proposition 2.12) or
even equal to −∞ (see Corollary 2.14 and Remark 2.15, along with part (a) of
Proposition 2.10).

Definition 2.5. Let Br(a) be a given ball in RN , of radius r and center a. Let
∂B be the boundary of the ball, which is an (N−1)-dimensional sphere, and assume
that G is a closed connected subset contained in a hemisphere of ∂B. Intuitively,
G is a disk-like subset (‘calotte’) of a hemisphere contained in the sphere ∂B. We
assume that G is open with respect to the relative topology of ∂B. The cone
K = Kr(a, G) with vertex at a, and of radius r, is deﬁned as the interior of the
convex hull of the union of {a} and G.

Definition 2.6. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN such that A∩ Ω 6=
∅. We say that the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) has the cone property at a point
a ∈ A ∩ Ω if there exists r > 0 such that Ω contains a cone Kr(a, G) with vertex at
a (and of radius r).

Remark 2.7. If a ∈ A ∩ Ω (hence, a is an inner point of Ω), then the cone
property of the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is obviously satisﬁed at this point. So,
the cone property is actually interesting only on the boundary of Ω, that is, at
a ∈ A ∩ ∂Ω.

Example 2.8. Given α > 0, let (A, Ωα) be the relative fractal drum in R2
deﬁned by A = {(0, 0)} and Ωα = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < xα, x ∈ (0, 1)}.
If
0 < α ≤ 1, then the cone property of (A, Ω) is fulﬁlled at a = (0, 0), whereas for
α > 1 it is not satisﬁed (at a = (0, 0)). Using these domains, we can construct a
one-parameter family of RFDs with negative box dimension; see Proposition 2.12
below.

In order to prove Proposition 2.10 below, we ﬁrst need an auxiliary result.

Lemma 2.9. Assume that K = Kr(a, G) is an open cone in RN with vertex at
a (and of radius r > 0), and f ∈ L1(0, r) is a nonnegative function. Then there
exists a positive integer m, depending only on N and on the opening angle of the
cone, such that

(2.2.1)

ZBr(a)

f (|x − a|) dx ≤ mZK

f (|x − a|) dx.

Proof. Since the sphere ∂B is compact, there exist ﬁnitely many calottes
G1, . . . , Gm contained in the sphere, which are all congruent to G (that is, each Gi
can be obtained from G by a rigid motion, for i = 1, . . . , m), and which cover ∂B.

2.2. CONE PROPERTY OF RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS

Let Ki = Kr(a, Gi), with i = 1, . . . , m, be the corresponding cones with vertex at
a. It is clear that the value of

does not depend on i. Since Br(a) = ∪m

f (|x − a|) dx = mZK

as desired.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.10. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN . Then:

(a) If the sets A and Ω are a positive distance apart (i.e., if d(A, Ω) > 0), then
D(ζA,Ω) = −∞; that is, ζA,Ω is an entire function. Furthermore, dimB(A, Ω) =
−∞.

(b) Assume that there exists at least one point a ∈ A ∩ Ω at which the relative

fractal drum (A, Ω) satisﬁes the cone property. Then D(ζA,Ω) ≥ 0.

Proof. (a) For r > 0 small enough such that r < d(A, Ω), where d(A, Ω) is
the distance between A and Ω, we have Ar ∩ Ω = ∅; so that ζA,Ar∩Ω(s) = 0 for
all s ∈ C. Therefore, D(ζA,Ar∩Ω) = −∞. Since ζA,Ω(s) − ζA,Ar∩Ω(s) is an entire
function, we conclude that we also have that D(ζA,Ω) = −∞. Since |Aε ∩ Ω| = 0
for all suﬃciently small ε > 0, we have Mr(A, Ω) = 0 for all r ∈ R, and therefore,
dimB(A, Ω) = −∞.

(b) Let us reason by contradiction and therefore assume that D(ζA,Ω) < 0. In
particular, ζA,Ω(s) is continuous at s = 0 (because it must then be holomorphic at
s = 0, according to part (a) of Theorem 2.1 above). By hypothesis, there exists an
open cone K = Kr(a, G), such that K ⊆ Ω. Using the inequality d(x, A) ≤ |x − a|
(valid for all x ∈ RN since a ∈ Ω) and Lemma 2.9, we deduce that for any real
number s ∈ (0, N ),

ζA,Ω(s) ≥ ζA,K(s) =ZK

d(x, A)s−N dx ≥ZK |x − a|s−N dx

This implies that ζA,Ω(s) → +∞ as s → 0+, s ∈ R, which contradicts the holomor-
phicity (or simply, the continuity) of ζA,Ω(s) at s = 0.

(cid:3)

The cone condition can be replaced by a much weaker condition, as we will

now explain in the following proposition.

Proposition 2.11. Let (rk)k≥0 be a decreasing sequence of positive real num-

bers, converging to zero. We deﬁne a subset of the cone Kr(a, G) as follows:

Kr(a, G, (rk)k≥0) =(cid:8)x ∈ Kr(a, G) : |x − a| ∈

∞[k=0

(r2k, r2k+1)(cid:9).

If we assume that the sequence (rk)k≥1 is such that

the drop in dimension phenomenon (for relative box dimensions).

then the conclusion of Proposition 2.10(b) still holds, with the cone condition in-
volving K = K(a, G) replaced by the above modiﬁed cone condition, involving the
set K′ := Kr(a, G, (rk)k≥0) contained in K.

The following proposition (building on Example 2.8 above) shows that the
box dimension of a relative fractal drum can be negative, and even take on any
prescribed negative value; see Figure 1.

Proposition 2.12. Let A = {(0, 0)} and

(2.2.6)

Ω = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < xα, x ∈ (0, 1)},

where α > 1. (See Figure 1.) Then the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) has a negative
box dimension. More speciﬁcally, dimB(A, Ω) exists, the relative fractal drum (A, Ω)
is Minkowski measurable and

Furthermore, s = 1 − α is a simple pole of ζA,Ω.

If we choose a point (x(ε), y(ε)) such that

therefore, (2.2.9) implies that dimB(A, Ω) = D and MD(A, Ω) = 1/(α + 1).

Since |Aε ∩ Ω| = ε2−D((α + 1)−1 + f (ε)), we conclude that
Dmer(ζA,Ω) ≤ D − (2α − 2) = 3(1 − α).

Furthermore, s = D is a simple pole.

Finally, we note that the equality D(ζA,Ω) = D follows from (2.1.1).

(cid:3)

In the following lemma, we show that for any δ > 0, the sets of principal

complex dimensions of the RFDs (A, Ω) and (A, Aδ ∩ Ω) coincide.

Lemma 2.13. Assume that (A, Ω) is a relative fractal drum in RN . Then, for

any δ > 0, we have

(2.2.12)
where the equivalence relation ∼ is given in Deﬁnition 1.7. In particular,
(2.2.13)

ζA,Ω ∼ ζA,Aδ∩Ω,

dimP C (A, Ω) = dimP C (A, Aδ ∩ Ω)

and therefore,

(2.2.14)
Here, Aδ, the δ-neighborhood of A, can be taken with respect to any norm on RN .
(This extra freedom will be used in Corollary 2.14 just below.)

dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Aδ ∩ Ω).

20

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Proof. Recall that according to the deﬁnition of a relative fractal drum (A, Ω),
there exists δ1 > 0 such that d(x, A) < δ1 for all x ∈ Ω; see Deﬁnition 1.1. On the
other hand, we have that d(x, A) > δ for all x ∈ Ω \ Aδ. Therefore, we conclude
that the diﬀerence

ζA,Ω(s) − ζA,Aδ∩Ω(s) =ZΩ\Aδ

d(x, A)s−N dx

deﬁnes an entire function. This proves the desired equivalence in (2.2.12). The re-
maining claims of the lemma follow immediately from this equivalence. Finally, the
fact that any norm on RN can be chosen to deﬁne Aδ follows from the equivalence
of all the norms on RN .
(cid:3)

The following result provides an example of a nontrivial relative fractal drum
It suﬃces to construct a domain Ω of R2

(A, Ω) such that dimB(A, Ω) = −∞.
which is ﬂat in a neighborhood of one of its boundary points.

Corollary 2.14 (A maximally ﬂat RFD). Let A = {(0, 0)} and

Ω′ = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < e−1/x, 0 < x < 1}.

(2.2.15)
Then dimB(A, Ω′) exists and
(2.2.16)

dimB(A, Ω′) = D(ζA,Ω′ ) = −∞.

Proof. Let us ﬁx α > 1. Then, by l’Hospital’s rule, we have that

e−1/x
xα = lim
t→+∞

tα
et = 0.

lim
x→0+

Hence, there exists δ = δ(α) > 0 such that 0 < e−1/x < xα for all x ∈ (0, δ); that
is,

Ω′δ(α) ⊂ Ωδ(α),

where

and

Ω′δ(α) := {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < e−1/x, 0 < x < δ(α)}
Ωδ(α) := {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < xα, 0 < x < δ(α)}.

Using Lemma 2.13, with Ω′ instead of Ω and with the ℓ∞-norm on R2 instead of the
usual Euclidean norm (note that Ω′δ(α) = Ω′ ∩ Bδ(α)(0), where Bδ(0) := {(x, y) ∈
R2 : |(x, y)|∞ < δ} and |(x, y)|∞ := max{|x|,|y|}), along with Proposition 2.12, we
see that

dimB(A, Ω′) = dimB(A, Ω′δ(α)) ≤ dimB(A, Ωδ(α)) = 1 − α.

The claim follows by letting α → +∞, since then, we have that
−∞ ≤ dimB(A, Ω′) ≤ dimB(A, Ω′) = −∞.

We conclude, as desired, that dimB(A, Ω) exists and is equal to −∞.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.15. (Flatness and ‘inﬁnitely sharp blade’).

It is easy to see that
Corollary 2.14 can be signiﬁcantly generalized. For example, it suﬃces to assume
that a is a point on the boundary of Ω such that the ﬂatness property of A (at
a) relative to Ω holds. This can even be formulated in terms of subsets A of the
boundary of Ω. We can imagine a bounded open set Ω ⊂ R3 with a Lipschitz
boundary ∂Ω, except on a subset A ⊂ ∂Ω, which may be a line segment, near

scribed in Remark 2.15.

matic illustration of the drop in dimension phenomenon (for relative box
dimensions).

which Ω is ﬂat; see Figure 2. A simple construction of such a set is Ω = Ω′ × (0, 1),
where Ω′ is given as in Corollary 2.14, and A = {(0, 0)} × (0, 1); see Equation
(2.2.15). Note that this domain is not Lipschitz near the points of A, and not even
H¨olderian. The ﬂatness of a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) can be deﬁned by

ﬂ(A, Ω) =(cid:0)dimB(A, Ω)(cid:1)− ,

where (r)− := max{0,−r} is the negative part of a real number r. We say that the
ﬂatness of (A, Ω) is nontrivial if ﬂ(A, Ω) > 0, that is, if dimB(A, Ω) < 0. In the
example mentioned just above, we have a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) with inﬁnite
ﬂatness, i.e., with ﬂ(A, Ω) = +∞. Intuitively, it can be viewed as an ‘ax’ with an
‘inﬁnitely sharp’ blade.

2.3. Scaling property of relative distance zeta functions

We start this section with the following result, which shows that if (A, Ω) is
a given relative fractal drum, then for any λ > 0, the zeta function ζλA,λΩ(s) of
the scaled relative fractal drum λ(A, Ω) := (λA, λΩ) is equal to the zeta function
ζA,Ω(s) of (A, Ω) multiplied by λs.

Theorem 2.16 (Scaling property of relative distance zeta functions). Let ζA,Ω(s)
be the relative distance zeta function of an RFD (A, Ω). Then, for any positive real
number λ, we have that D(ζλA,λΩ)) = D(ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω) and

(2.3.1)

ζλA,λΩ(s) = λsζA,Ω(s),

for all s ∈ C with Re s > dimB(A, Ω) and any λ > 0. (See also Corollary 2.17
below for a more general statement.)

Proof. The claim is established by introducing a new variable y = x/λ, and by
noting that d(λy, λA) = λ d(y, A), for any y ∈ RN (which is an easy consequence of
the homogeneity of the Euclidean norm). Indeed, in light of part (b) of Theorem 2.1,

22

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

for any s ∈ C with Re s > dimB(A, Ω) = D(ζA,Ω), we have successively:

d(x, λA)s−N dx

d(λy, λA)s−N λN dy

ζλA,λΩ(s) =ZλΩ
=ZΩ
= λsZΩ

d(y, A)s−N dy = λsζA,Ω(s).

It follows that (2.3.1) holds and ζλA,λΩ is holomorphic for Re s > dimB(A, Ω). Since
D(ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω) (by part (b) of Theorem 2.1), we deduce that D(ζλA,λΩ) ≤
D(ζA,Ω), for every λ > 0. But then, replacing λ by its reciprocal λ−1 in this last
inequality, we obtain the reverse inequality (more speciﬁcally, we replace (A, Ω) by
(λ−1A, λ−1Ω) to deduce that for every λ > 0, D(ζA,Ω) ≤ D(ζλ−1A,λ−1Ω); we then
substitute λ−1 for λ in this last inequality in order to obtain the desired reversed
inequality: for every λ > 0, D(ζA,Ω) ≤ D(ζλA,λΩ)), and hence, we conclude that

dimB(A, Ω) = D(ζA,Ω) = D(ζλA,λΩ),

for all λ > 0, as desired.

(cid:3)

We note that if L = (ℓj)j≥1 is a fractal string, and λ is a positive constant,
then for the scaled string λL := (λℓj)j≥1, the corresponding claim in Theorem 2.16
is trivial: ζλL(s) = λsζL(s), for every λ > 0. Indeed, by deﬁnition of the geometric
zeta function of a fractal string (see Equation (1.2.8)), we have

ζλL(s) =

∞Xj=1

(λℓj)s = λs ∞Xj=1

ℓs
j = λsζL(s),

for Re s > D(ζL). (The same argument as above then shows that D(ζL) = D(ζλL).)
Then, by analytic (i.e., meromorphic) continuation, the same identity continues to
hold in any domain to which ζL can be meromorphically extended to the left of the
critical line {Re s = D(ζL)}.

The following result supplements Theorem 2.16 in several diﬀerent and signiﬁ-

cant ways.

Corollary 2.17. Fix λ > 0. Assume that ζA,Ω admits a meromorphic con-
tinuation to some open connected neighborhood U of the open half-plane {Re s >
dimB(A, Ω)}. Then, so does ζλA,λΩ and the identity (2.3.1) continues to hold for
every s ∈ U which is not a pole of ζA,Ω (and hence, of ζλA,λΩ as well).
Moreover, if we assume, for simplicity, that ω is a simple pole of ζA,Ω (and
hence also, of ζλA,λΩ), then the following identity holds:

(2.3.2)

res(ζλ(A,Ω), ω) = λω res(ζA,Ω, ω).

If s is a multiple pole, then an analogous statement can be made about the principal
parts (instead of the residues) of the zeta functions involved, as the reader can easily
verify.

Proof. The fact that ζλA,λΩ is holomorphic at a given point s ∈ U if ζA,Ω
is holomorphic at s (for example, if Re s > dimB(A, Ω)), follows from (2.3.1) and
the equality D(ζλA,λΩ) = D(ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω). An analogous statement is true
if “holomorphic” is replaced with “meromorphic”. More speciﬁcally, by analytic

2.3. SCALING PROPERTY OF RELATIVE DISTANCE ZETA FUNCTIONS

23

continuation of (2.3.1), ζλA,λΩ is meromorphic in an open connected set U if and
only if ζA,Ω is meromorphic in U , and then, clearly, identity (2.3.1) continues to hold
for every s ∈ U which is not a pole of ζA,Ω (and hence also, of ζλA,λΩ). Therefore,
the ﬁrst part of the corollary is established.
Next, assume that ω is a simple pole of ζA,Ω. Then, in light of (2.3.1) and the
discussion in the previous paragraph, we have that for all s in a pointed neighbor-
hood of ω (contained in U but not containing any other pole of ζA,Ω),

(2.3.3)

(s − ω)ζλ(A,Ω)(s) = λs ((s − ω)ζA,Ω(s)) .

The fact that (2.3.2) holds now follows by letting s → ω, s 6= ω in (2.3.3). Indeed,
we then have

and similarly for res(ζλ(A,Ω), ω).

(cid:3)

res(ζA,Ω, ω) = lim
s→ω

(s − ω)ζA,Ω(s),

The scaling property of relative zeta functions (established in Theorem 2.16
and Corollary 2.17) motivates us to introduce the notion of relative fractal spray,
which is very close to (but not identical with) the usual notion of fractal spray
introduced by the ﬁrst author and Carl Pomerance in [LapPo3] (see [Lap-vFr3]
and the references therein). First, we deﬁne the operation of union of (disjoint)
families of RFDs (Deﬁnition 2.18).

Definition 2.18. Let (Aj, Ωj)j≥1 be a countable family of relative fractal
drums in RN , such that the corresponding family of open sets (Ωj)j≥1 is disjoint
(i.e., Ωj ∩ Ωk = ∅ for j 6= k), Aj ⊆ Ωj for each j ∈ N, and the set Ω := ∪∞j=1Ωj is of
ﬁnite N -dimensional Lebesgue measure (but may be unbounded). Then, the union
of the (ﬁnite or countable) family of relative fractal drums (Aj, Ωj) (j ≥ 1) is the
relative fractal drum (A, Ω), where A := ∪∞j=1Aj and Ω := ∪∞j=1Ωj. We write

(2.3.4)

(A, Ω) =

(Aj , Ωj).

∞Gj=1

It is easy to derive the following countable additivity property of the distance

zeta functions.

Theorem 2.19. Assume that (Aj , Ωj)j≥1 is a ﬁnite or countable family of
RFDs satisfying the conditions of Deﬁnition 2.18, and let (A, Ω) be its union (in
the sense of Equation (2.3.4) appearing in Deﬁnition 2.18). Furthermore, assume
that the following condition is fulﬁlled:

(2.3.5)

For any j ∈ N and x ∈ Ωj, we have that d(x, A) = d(x, Aj ).

Then, for Re s > dimB(A, Ω),

(2.3.6)

ζA,Ω(s) =

ζAj ,Ωj (s).

∞Xj=1

Condition (2.3.5) is satisﬁed, if for every j ∈ N, Aj is equal to the boundary of Ωj
in RN (that is, Aj := ∂Ωj).

24

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Proof. The claim follows from the following computation, which is valid for

Re s > dimB(A, Ω):

(2.3.7)

ζA,Ω(s) =ZΩ
∞Xj=1ZΩj

=

∞Xj=1ZΩj
∞Xj=1

d(x, A)s−N dx =

d(x, A)s−N dx

d(x, Aj )s−N dx =

ζAj ,Ωj (s).

More speciﬁcally, clearly, (2.3.7) holds for every real number s such that s >

dimB(A, Ω) ≥ D(ζA,Ω). Therefore, for such a value of s,

ζA,Ωj (s) =ZΩj

d(x, A)s−N dx ≤ZΩ

d(x, A)s−N dx = ζA,Ω(s) < ∞,

for every j ≥ 1. Hence,
sup
(2.3.8)

j≥1 {D(ζA,Ωj )} ≤ D(ζA,Ω) ≤ dimB(A, Ω),

from which (2.3.7) now follows for all s ∈ C with Re s > dimB(A, Ω), in light of
the countable additivity of the local complex Borel measure (and hence, locally
bounded measure) on Ω, given by dγ(x) := d(x, A)s−N dx. (Note that according
to the hypothesis of Deﬁnition 2.18, we have |Ω| < ∞, so that dγ is indeed a local
complex Borel measure; see, e.g., [Foll] or [Ru], along with [DolFri], [JohLap],
[JohLapNi] and [LapRaˇZu1, Appendix A].)
(cid:3)

Remark 2.20. In the statement of Theorem 2.19, the numerical series on the
right-hand side of (2.3.6) converges absolutely (and hence, converges also in C) for
all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimB(A, Ω). In particular, for every real number s such
that s > dimB(A, Ω), it is a convergent series of positive terms (i.e., it has a ﬁnite
sum). It remains to be investigated whether (and under which hypotheses) Equa-
tion (2.3.6) continues to hold for all s ∈ C in a common domain of meromorphicity
of the zeta functions ζA,Ω and ζA,Ωj for j ≥ 1 (away from the poles). At the poles,
an analogous question could be raised for the corresponding residues (assuming, for
simplicity, that the poles are simple).

2.4. Relative tube zeta functions

We begin this section by introducing the relative tube zeta function associated

with the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) in RN . It is deﬁned by

(2.4.1)

˜ζA,Ω(s) :=Z δ

0

ts−N−1|At ∩ Ω| dt,

for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large, where δ > 0 is ﬁxed. As we see, ˜ζA,Ω
involves the relative tube function t 7→ |At ∩ Ω|. As was noted in Remark 2.4, if
Ω := Aδ with A ⊂ RN bounded, we recover the tube zeta function of the set A;
that is, ˜ζA(s) :=R δ
The abscissa of convergence of the relative tube zeta function ˜ζA,Ω is given by
D(˜ζA,Ω) = dimB(A, Ω). This follows from the following fundamental identity (or

relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω, deﬁned by (1.2.7):

(2.4.2)
for all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimB(A, Ω). Its proof is based on the the known
identity

ζA,Aδ∩Ω(s) = δs−N|Aδ ∩ Ω| + (N − s)˜ζA,Ω(s),

where γ > 0; see [ˇZu1, Theorem 2.9(a)], or a more general form provided in [ˇZu2,
Lemma 3.1]. As a special case, when Ω := Aδ with A ⊂ RN bounded, Equation
(2.4.2) reduces to

(2.4.4)
for all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimBA, which has been obtained in [LapRaˇZu2].
The following proposition connects the residues of relative tube and distance

ζA(s) = δs−N|Aδ| + (N − s)˜ζA(s),

functions.

Proposition 2.21. Assume that (A, Ω) is an RFD in RN . Let U be a connected
open subset of C to which the relative distance zeta function ζA,Ω can be meromor-
phically extended, and such that it contains the critical line {Re s = D(ζA,Ω)}.
Then the relative tube function ˜ζA,Ω can be meromorphically extended to U as well.
Furthermore, if ω ∈ U is a simple pole of ζA,Ω, then it is also a simple pole of ˜ζA,Ω

and we have that

res(ζA,Ω, ω) = (N − ω) · res(˜ζA,Ω, ω).

Moreover, the functional equation (2.4.2) continues to hold for all s ∈ U .
relative tube function in the above statement.

The proposition also holds if we interchange the relative distance function and

Proof. Since the diﬀerence ζA,Ω(s) − ζA,Aδ∩Ω(s) = ζA,Ω\Aδ∩Ω(s) is an entire
function (note that δ < d(x, A) < c, where c := supx∈A d(x, A) < ∞; see property
(1.2.2) in Deﬁnition 1.1 of the RFD), it suﬃces to prove the proposition in the case
of the RFD (A, Aδ∩Ω) instead of (A, Ω). The claim now follows from the functional
equation (2.4.2). We leave the details to the interested reader.

(cid:3)

Example 2.22 (Torus relative fractal drum). Let Ω be an open solid torus in
R3 deﬁned by two radii r and R, where 0 < r < R < ∞, and let A := ∂Ω be its
topological boundary. In order to compute the tube zeta function of the torus RFD
(A, Ω), we ﬁrst compute its tube function. Let δ ∈ (0, r) be ﬁxed. Using Cavalieri’s
principle, we have that

for all t ∈ (0, δ), from which it follows that

for all s ∈ C such that Re s > 2. The right-hand side deﬁnes a meromorphic function
on the entire complex plane, so that, using the principle of analytic continuation,
˜ζA,Ω can be (uniquely) meromorphically extended to the whole of C. In particular,
we see that the multiset of complex dimensions of the torus RFD (A, Ω) is given by

26

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

P(A, Ω) = {1, 2}. Each of the complex dimensions 1 and 2 is simple. In particular,
we have that

(2.4.8)

dimP C (A, Ω) = {2} and

res(˜ζA,Ω, 2) = 4πRr.

Also, dimB(A, Ω) = D(˜ζA) = 2. From Equation (2.5.8) appearing in Theorem 2.24
below, we conclude that the 2-dimensional Minkowski content of the torus RFD
(A, Ω) is given by

(2.4.9)

M2(A, Ω) = 4πRr.

Since |At|3 = 2πR(cid:0)(r + t)2 − (r − t)2(cid:1), we can also easily compute the ‘ordinary’

tube zeta function ˜ζA of the torus surface A in R3:
δs−2
s − 2

˜ζA(s) = 8πRr

(2.4.10)

,

In particular, res(˜ζA, 2) = 8πRr. Using Equations (2.4.2) and
for all s ∈ C.
(2.4.4), we deduce from (2.4.10) the corresponding expressions for the distance zeta
functions, which are valid for all s ∈ C:

and

P(ζA,Ω) = P(˜ζA,Ω) = {1, 2}

(with each pole 1 and 2 being simple) and

Pc(ζA,Ω) = Pc(˜ζA,Ω) = {2}

dimB(A, Ω) = D(ζA,Ω) = D(˜ζA,Ω) = 2.

Furthermore, we see that res(ζA,Ω, 2) = 4πRr and res(ζA, 2) = 8πRr, in agreement
with (2.4.5) in Proposition 2.21 above.

One can easily extend the example of the 2-torus to any (smooth) closed sub-
manifold of RN (and, in particular, of course, to the n-torus, with n ≥ 2). This can
be done by using Federer’s tube formula [Fed1] for sets of positive reach, which
extends and uniﬁes Weyl’s tube formula [Wey] for (proper) smooth submanifolds
of RN and Steiner’s formula (obtained by Steiner [Stein] and his successors) for
compact convex subsets of RN . The global form of Federer’s tube formula expresses
the volume of t-neighborhoods of a (compact) set of positive reach2 A ⊂ RN as a
polynomial of degree at most N in t, whose coeﬃcients are (essentially) the so-
called Federer’s curvatures and which generalize Weyl’s curvatures in [Wey] (see
[BergGos] for an exposition) and Steiner’s curvatures in [Stein] (see [Schn, Chap-
ter 4] for a detailed exposition) in the case of submanifolds and compact convex
sets, respectively.

2A closed subset C of RN is said to be of positive reach if there exists δ > 0 such that every
point x ∈ RN within a distance less than δ from C has a unique metric projection onto C; see
[Fed1]. The reach of C is deﬁned as the supremum of all such positive numbers δ. Clearly, every
closed convex subset of RN is of inﬁnite (and hence, positive) reach.

2.5. MEROMORPHIC EXTENSIONS OF RELATIVE ZETA FUNCTIONS

27

In the present context, for a compact set of positive reach C ⊂ RN , it is easy to
deduce from the tube formula in [Fed1] an explicit expression for ˜ζA(s), as follows
(with A := ∂C).3

Proposition 2.23. Let A = ∂C be the boundary of a (nonempty) compact set

C of positive reach in RN . Then, for any δ > 0 suﬃciently small, we have that

duces at once a corresponding explicit expression for the distance zeta function
ζA(s) := ζA(s; δ).)

Hence, dimB A exists and

(2.4.13) D := D(˜ζA) = D(ζA) = dimB A = max{k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1} : ck 6= 0}
and (since D ≤ N − 1 < N ),
(2.4.14)

P := P(˜ζA) = P(ζA) ⊆ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}.

In fact,

(2.4.15)

dimensions of A is simple.

P =(cid:8)k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1} : ck 6= 0(cid:9) ⊆ {k0, . . . , D},

where k0 := min(cid:8)k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , D} : ck 6= 0(cid:9). Furthermore, each of the complex

Finally, if C is such that its aﬃne hull is all of RN (which is the case when the
interior of C is nonempty and, in particular, if C is a convex body), then D = N−1,
while if C is a (smooth) submanifold with boundary the closed d-dimensional smooth
submanifold A := ∂C (with 0 ≤ d ≤ N − 1), then D = d.

For the 2-torus A, we have N = 3, D = 2 (since the Euler characteristic of A
is equal to zero), c2 6= 0,4 c1 6= 0, and hence, c0 = 0, k0 = 1 and P = {1, 2}, as was
found in Example 2.22 via a direct computation.
We note that much more general tube formulas called (as in [Lap-vFr2–3]
and [LapPeWi2–3],
[LapPeWi1–2]) “fractal tube formulas” are obtained in
[LapRaˇZu5] (as well as in [LapRaˇZu1, Chapter 5], see also [LapRaˇZu4]) for
arbitrary bounded sets (and even more generally, RFDs) in RN , under mild growth
assumptions on the associated fractal zeta functions.

2.5. Meromorphic extensions of relative zeta functions

We shall use the following assumption on the asymptotics of the relative tube

function t 7→ |At ∩ Ω|:
(2.5.1)
where M > 0, α > 0 and D ≤ N are given in advance. Here, we assume that
the function h(t) is positive and has a suﬃciently slow growth near the origin, in

|At ∩ Ω| = tN−Dh(t)(M + O(tα))

t → 0+,

as

3Relative versions are also possible, for example for the RFD (A,

C), where

C is the interior

of C, assumed to be nonempty.

4Note that c2 is just proportional to the area of the 2-torus, with the proportionality constant

being a standard positive constant.

the sense that for any c > 0, h(t) = O(tc) as t → 0+. Typical examples of such
functions are h(t) = (log t−1)m, m ≥ 1, or more generally,
(t−1)(cid:1)m

(the m-th power of the n-th iterated logarithm of t−1, for n ≥ 1), and in these cases
we obviously have MD(A, Ω) = +∞. For this and other examples, see [HeLap].
The function t 7→ tDh(t)−1 is usually called a gauge function, but for the sake of
simplicity, we shall instead use this name only for the function h(t).
Assuming that a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) in RN is such that D = dimB(A, Ω)
∗ (A, Ω) = 0 or +∞ (or M∗D(A, Ω) = 0 or +∞), it makes sense to de-
exists, and MD
ﬁne a new class of relative lower and upper Minkowski contents of (A, Ω), associated
with a suitably chosen gauge function h(t):

|At ∩ Ω|

|At ∩ Ω|
tN−Dh(t)

.

The aim is to ﬁnd an explicit gauge function so that these two contents are in
∗(A, Ω, h) and r 7→ M∗r(A, Ω, h), r ∈ R, deﬁned
(0, +∞), and the functions r 7→ Mr
exactly as in (2.5.2), except for D replaced with r, have a jump from +∞ to 0
when r crosses the value of D.
In this generality, the above contents are called
gauge relative Minkowski contents (with respect to h).

If for some gauge function h, say, we have that MD(A, Ω, h) ∈ (0, +∞) (which
∗ (A, Ω, h) = M∗D(A, Ω, h) and that this common value,
means, as usual, that MD
denoted by MD(A, Ω, h), lies in (0, +∞)), we say (as in [HeLap]) that the fractal
drum (A, Ω) is h-Minkowski measurable.
In what follows, we denote the Laurent expansion of a meromorphic extension
(assumed to exist) of the relative tube zeta function ˜ζA,Ω to an open, connected
neighborhood of s = D (more speciﬁcally, an open pointed disk centered at s = D)
by

(2.5.3)

˜ζA,Ω(s) =

∞Xj=−∞

cj(s − D)j,

where, of course, cj = 0 for all j ≪ 0 (that is, there exists j0 ∈ Z such that cj = 0
for all j < j0).
Let us ﬁrst introduce some notation. Given a T -periodic function G : R → R,

we denote by G0 its truncation to [0, T ]; that is

while the Fourier transform of G0 is denoted by ˆG0:

The following theorem shows that, in order to obtain a meromorphic extension
of the zeta function to the left of the abscissa of convergence, it is important to have

2.5. MEROMORPHIC EXTENSIONS OF RELATIVE ZETA FUNCTIONS

29

some information about the second term in the asymptotic expansion of the relative
tube function t 7→ |Aδ ∩ Ω| near t = 0. It is important to note that the presence
(in Theorem 2.24) of the gauge function h(t) := (log t−1)m is closely related to
the multiplicity of the principal complex dimension D, which is equal to m + 1.
Theorem 2.24 extends [LapRaˇZu3, Theorem 4.24] to the general setting of RFDs.
Observe that since the case when m = 0 is allowed in Theorem 2.24 just below,
that theorem enables us to deal, in particular, with the usual class of Minkowski
measurable RFDs (for which the gauge function h is trivial, i.e., satisﬁes h(t) ≡ 1).
Theorem 2.24 (Minkowski measurable RFDs). Let (A, Ω) be a relative frac-
tal drum in RN such that (2.5.1) holds for some D ≤ N , M > 0, α > 0 and
with h(t) := (log t−1)m for all t ∈ (0, 1), where m is a nonnegative integer. Then
the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is h-Minkowski measurable, dimB(A, Ω) = D, and
MD(A, Ω, h) = M. Furthermore, the relative tube zeta function ˜ζA,Ω has for ab-
scissa of convergence D(˜ζA,Ω) = D, and it possesses a (necessarily unique) mero-
morphic extension (at least) to the open right half-plane {Re s > D − α}; that is,
the abscissa of meromorphic continuation Dmer(˜ζA,Ω) of ˜ζA,Ω can be estimated by

(2.5.6)

Dmer(˜ζA,Ω) ≤ D − α.

Moreover, s = D is the unique pole in this half-plane, and it is of order m + 1. In
addition, the coeﬃcients of the Laurent series expansion (2.5.3) corresponding to
the principal part of ˜ζA,Ω at s = D are given by

(2.5.7)

c−m−1 = m!M,

c−m = ··· = c−1 = 0

(provided m ≥ 1.)

If m = 0, then D is a simple pole of ˜ζA,Ω and we have that

(2.5.8)

Proof. Let us set

zm(s) =Z δ

ts−D−1(log t−1)mdt,

ts−N−1(log t−1)m O(tN−D+α) dt.

Since ˜ζA,Ω(s) = ζ1(s) + ζ2(s), we can proceed as follows. It is easy to see that for
each ε > 0, we have (log t−1)m = O(t−ε) as t → 0+; hence,
O(tRe s−1−D+(α−ε)) dt.

|ζ2(s)| ≤Z δ

0

Then, since the integral is well deﬁned for all s ∈ C with Re s > D − (α − ε), we
deduce that D(ζ2) ≤ D− (α− ε). Letting ε → 0+, we obtain the desired inequality:
D(ζ2) ≤ D − α.

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Integration by parts yields the following recurrence relation, where we have to
assume (at ﬁrst) that Re s > D:

(2.5.11)

zm(s) =

1

s − D(cid:0)(log δ−1)mδs−D + mzm−1(s)(cid:1) ,

for m ≥ 1,

and z0(s) = (s − D)−1δs−D. Since D(ζ2) ≤ D − α, it is clear that the coeﬃcients
cj, j < 0, of the Laurent series expansion (2.5.3) of ˜ζA,Ω(s) = ζ1(s) + ζ2(s) in a
connected open neighborhood of s = D do not depend on δ > 0. Indeed, changing
the value of δ > 0 to δ1 > 0 in (2.4.1) is equivalent to addingR δ1
ts−N−1|At ∩ Ω| dt,
which is an entire function of s. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may take
δ = 1 in (2.5.11):

In this way, we obtain that

zm(s) =

(2.5.13)

ζ1(s) =

and we can meromorphically continue ζ1 from the half-plane {Re s > D} to the
entire complex plane. The claim then follows from the equality ˜ζA,Ω(s) = ζ1(s) +
ζ2(s).
(cid:3)

A large class of examples of RFDs satisfying condition (2.5.1), involving power
logarithmic gauge functions, can be found in Example 4.26 of §4.4 below, based
on [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 6.13].
(In fact, [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 6.13] can be
understood as a partial converse of the above result, Theorem 2.24.) These RFDs
are constructed by using consecutive tensor products of a suitable bounded fractal
string L, i.e., by an iterated spraying of L; see [LapRaˇZu5] for details. A nontrivial
class of examples is already obtained when L is the ternary Cantor string. A similar
comment can be made about the analogous condition (2.5.14) appearing in the
folowing theorem.

Theorem 2.25 (Minkowski nonmeasurable RFDs). Let (A, Ω) be a relative
fractal drum in RN such that there exist D ≤ N , a nonconstant periodic function
G : R → R with minimal period T > 0, and a nonnegative integer m, satisfying
(2.5.14)

as

t → 0+.

Then dimB(A, Ω) exists and dimB(A, Ω) = D, G is continuous, and

|At ∩ Ω| = tN−D(log t−1)m(cid:0)G(log t−1) + O(tα)(cid:1)
MD

∗ (A, Ω, h) = min G, M∗D(A, Ω, h) = max G,

where h(t) := (log t−1)m for all t ∈ (0, 1). Furthermore, the tube zeta function ˜ζA,Ω
has for abscissa of convergence D(˜ζA,Ω) = D, and it possesses a (necessarily unique)
meromorphic extension (at least) to the open right half-plane {Re s > D − α}; that
is,

(2.5.15)

Dmer(˜ζA,Ω) ≤ D − α.

Moreover, all of its poles located in this half-plane are of order m + 1, and the set
of poles P(˜ζA,Ω) is contained in the vertical line {Re s = D}. More precisely,

2.6. Construction of ∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drums

Our construction of quasiperiodic RFDs (see Deﬁnition 2.37 below) given in
this section is based on a certain two-parameter family of generalized Cantor sets,
which we now describe.

Definition 2.28. The generalized Cantor sets C(m,a) are determined by an
integer m ≥ 2 and a positive real number a such that ma < 1. In the ﬁrst step
of the analog of Cantor’s construction of the standard ternary Cantor set, we start
with m equidistant, closed intervals in [0, 1] of length a, with m − 1 ‘holes’, each of
length (1− ma)/(m− 1). In the second step, we continue by scaling by the factor a
each of the m intervals of length a; and so on, ad inﬁnitum. The (two-parameter)
generalized Cantor set C(m,a) is deﬁned as the intersection of the decreasing se-
quence of compact sets constructed in this way. It is easy to check that C(m,a) is a
perfect, uncountable compact subset of R. (Recall that a perfect set is a closed set
without any isolated points.) Furthermore, C(m,a) is also self-similar.

2.6. CONSTRUCTION OF ∞-QUASIPERIODIC RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS

33

In order to avoid any possible confusion, we note that the generalized Cantor
sets introduced here are diﬀerent from the generalized Cantor strings introduced
and studied in [Lap-vFr3, Chapter 10]. With our present notation, the classic
ternary Cantor set is obtained as C(2,1/3).

We note that the box dimension of C(m,a) exists and is equal to its Hausdorﬀ
dimension, as well as its similarity dimension (here, log1/a m). The proof of this
fact in the case of the classic Cantor set can be found in [Fal1]; see also [Hut].
For any pair (m, a) as above, this follows from a general result in [Hut] (described
in [Fal1, Theorem 9.3]) because C(m,a) is a self-similar set satisfying the open set
condition. (See also [Mora].)

It can be shown that the generalized Cantor sets C(m,a) have the following
properties. Apart from the proof of (2.6.5), the proof of the next proposition is
similar to that for the standard Cantor set (see [Lap-vFr3, Eq. (1.11)]).

Proposition 2.29. If C(m,a) ⊂ R is the generalized Cantor set introduced in

Deﬁnition 2.28, where m is an integer, m ≥ 2, and a ∈ (0, 1/m), then
(2.6.1)

D := dimB C(m,a) = D(ζA) = log1/a m.

Furthermore, the tube formula associated with C(m,a) is given by

(2.6.2)
for all t ∈ (0, 1−ma
minimal period equal to T = log(1/a), and is deﬁned by

| = t1−DG(log t−1)

|C(m,a)

2(m−1) ), where G = G(τ ) is a nonconstant periodic function, with

(2.6.3)

G(τ ) = cD−1(ma)g( τ−c

T ) + 2 cDmg( τ−c

T ).

Here, c = 1−ma
g(x) = 1 − x for x ∈ (0, 1].

Moreover,

2(m−1) , and g : R → [0, +∞) is the 1-periodic function deﬁned by

Finally, if we assume that δ ≥ 1−ma

2(m−1) , then the distance zeta function of A :=

C(m,a) is given by

As a result, ζA(s) admits a meromorphic continuation to all of C, given by the last
expression in (2.6.5). In particular, the set of poles of ζA(s) (in C) and the residue
of ζA(s) at s = D are respectively given by

P(ζA) = (D + piZ) ∪ {0}

more,

p,

and both p → 0+ and D → 0+ as a → 0+. In particular, P(ζA) converges to the
imaginary axis in the Hausdorﬀ metric, as a → 0+. Finally, each pole in P(ζA) is

simple.

In the sequel, we shall need the following important theorem from transcen-

dental number theory, due to Baker [Ba, Theorem 2.1].

Theorem 2.30 (Baker,

If
m1, . . . , mn are positive algebraic numbers such that log m1, . . . , log mn are linearly
independent over the rationals, then

[Ba, Theorem 2.1]). Let n ∈ N with n ≥ 2.

1, log m1, . . . , log mn

are linearly independent over the ﬁeld of all algebraic numbers (or algebraically
independent, in short). In particular, the numbers log m1, . . . , log mn are transcen-
dental, as well as their pairwise quotients.

Here, we describe a general construction of quasiperiodic fractal drums possess-
ing inﬁnitely many algebraically incommensurable periods. It is based on properties
of generalized Cantor sets, as well as on Baker’s theorem (Theorem 2.30 just above).
Let m ≥ 2 be a given integer and D ∈ (0, 1) a given real number. Then,
for a > 0 deﬁned by a = m−1/D, we have am = m1−1/D < 1, and hence, the
generalized Cantor set A = C(m,a) is well deﬁned, and dimB A = log1/a m = D.

Definition 2.31. A ﬁnite set of real numbers is said to be rationally (resp.,
algebraically) linearly independent or simply, rationally (resp., algebraically) inde-
pendent, if it is linearly independent over the ﬁeld of rational (resp., algebraic) real
numbers.

Definition 2.32. A sequence (Ti)i≥1 of real numbers is said to be rationally
(resp., algebraically) linearly independent if any of its ﬁnite subsets is rationally
(resp., algebraically) independent. We then say that (Ti)i≥1 is rationally (resp.,
algebraically) independent, for short.

Definition 2.33. Let m ≥ 2 be a positive integer. Let p = (pi)i≥1 be the

sequence of all prime numbers, arranged in increasing order; that is,

p = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . ).

We then deﬁne the exponent sequence e = e(m) := (αi)i≥1 associated with m,
where αi ≥ 0 is the multiplicity of pi in the factorization of m. We also let
(2.6.7)

.

p e := Y{i≥1:αi>0}

pαi
i

The set of all sequences e with components in N0 = N ∪ {0}, such that all but at
most ﬁnitely many components are equal to zero, is denoted by (N0)∞c .

With this deﬁnition, for any integer m ≥ 2, we obviously have m = p e(m).

Conversely, any e ∈ (N0)∞c deﬁnes a unique integer m ≥ 2 such that m = p e.

2.6. CONSTRUCTION OF ∞-QUASIPERIODIC RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS

35

Definition 2.34. Given an exponent vector e = (αi)i≥1 ∈ (N0)∞c , we deﬁne

the support of e as the set of all indices i ∈ N for which αi > 0, and we write
(2.6.8)
The support of an integer m ≥ 2 is deﬁned as supp m := supp e(m).

S(e) = supp(e) := {i ≥ 1 : αi > 0}.

The following deﬁnition will be useful in the sequel.
Definition 2.35. We say that a set {ei : i ≥ 1} of exponent vectors is rationally
linearly independent if any of its ﬁnite subsets is linearly independent over Q. We
then say for short that the exponent vectors are rationally independent.

The following two deﬁnitions, Deﬁnition 2.36 and Deﬁnition 2.37, reﬁne and ex-
tend the deﬁnition of n-quasiperiodic function and set introduced in [LapRaˇZu2].
Definition 2.36. We say that a function G : R → R is ∞-quasiperiodic if it is

of the form

G(τ ) = H(τ, τ, . . . ),

where H : ℓ∞(R) → R,5 H = H(τ1, τ2, . . . ) is a function which is Tj-periodic in its
j-th component, for each j ∈ N, with Tj > 0 as minimal periods, and such that the
set of periods

(2.6.9)

{Tj : j ≥ 1}

is rationally independent. We say that the order of quasiperiodicity of the function
G is equal to inﬁnity (or that the function G is ∞-quasiperiodic).

In addition, we say that G is
(a) transcendentally quasiperiodic of inﬁnite order (or transcendentally ∞-

quasiperiodic) if the periods in (2.6.9) are algebraically independent;

(b) algebraically quasiperiodic of inﬁnite order (or algebraically ∞-quasiperio-
dic) of inﬁnite order if the periods in (2.6.9) are rationally independent and alge-
braically dependent.

We say that a sequence (Ti)i≥1 of real numbers is algebraically dependent of
inﬁnite order if there exists a ﬁnite subset J of N such that (Ti)i∈J is algebraically
dependent (that is, linearly dependent over the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers). Recall
that a ﬁnite set of real numbers {T1, . . . , Tk} is said to be algebraically dependent if
there exist k algebraic real numbers λ1, . . . , λk, not all of which are equal to zero,
such that λ1T1 + ··· + λkTk = 0.

Definition 2.37. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN having the fol-

lowing tube formula:

(2.6.10)
where D ∈ (−∞, N ], and G is nonnegative such that

|At ∩ Ω| = tN−D(G(log t−1) + o(1)) as

t → 0+,

0 < lim inf
τ→+∞

G(τ ) ≤ lim sup

G(τ ) < ∞.

(Note that it then follows that dimB(A, Ω) exists and is equal to D. Moreover,
MD

∗ (A, Ω) = lim inf τ→+∞ G(τ ) and M∗D(A, Ω) = lim supτ→+∞ G(τ ).)
5Here, ℓ∞(R) stands for the usual Banach space of bounded sequences (τj )j≥1 of real num-

bers, endowed with the norm k(τj )j≥1k∞ := supj≥1 |τj |.

36

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

We then say that the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) in RN is quasiperiodic and
of inﬁnite order of quasiperiodicity (or, in short, ∞-quasiperiodic) if the function
G = G(τ ) is ∞-quasiperiodic; see Deﬁnition 2.36.

In addition, (A, Ω) is said to be

(a) a transcendentally ∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drum if the correspond-

ing function G is transcendentally ∞-quasiperiodic;

(b) an algebraically ∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drum if the corresponding

function G is algebraically ∞-quasiperiodic.

The following deﬁnition is closely related to the the notion of fractality (given in
[Lap-vFr3], §12.1.1 and §12.1.2, including Figures 12.1–12.3, along with §13.4.3).
Definition 2.38. Let A be a bounded subset of RN and let D := dimBA.

Then:

(i) The set A is a hyperfractal (or is hyperfractal) if there is a screen S along
which the associated tube (or equivalently, if D < N , distance) zeta function is a
natural boundary. This means that the zeta function cannot be meromorphically
continued to an open neighborhood of S (or, equivalently, of the associated window
W ).

(ii) The set A is a strong hyperfractal (or is strongly hyperfractal) if the critical
line {Re s = D} is a natural boundary of the associated zeta function; that is, if we
can choose S = {Re s = D} in (i).

(iii) Finally, the set A is maximally hyperfractal if it is strongly hyperfractal
and every point of the critical line is a nonremovable singularity of the zeta function.

An analogous deﬁnition can be provided (in the obvious manner) where instead
of A, we have a fractal string L = (ℓj)j≥1 in R or a relative fractal drum (A, Ω)
in RN .

Remark 2.39. Following [Lap-vFr3], but now using the higher-dimensional
theory of complex dimensions developed in this memoir and in [LapRˇZu1–7],
we say that a bounded set A ⊂ RN (or, more generally, an RFD (A, Ω) in RN )
is “fractal” if it has at least one nonreal visible complex dimension6 (i.e., if the
associated fractal zeta function has a nonreal visible pole) or if it is hyperfractal
(in the sense of part (i) of Deﬁnition 2.38 just above).

The following result can be considered as a fractal set-theoretic interpreta-
tion of Baker’s theorem [Ba, Theorem 2.1] (i.e., of Theorem 2.30 above) from
transcendental number theory.
It provides a construction of a transcendentally
∞-quasiperiodic relative fractal drum. In particular, this drum possesses inﬁnitely
many algebraically incommensurable quasiperiods Ti. In our construction, we use
the two-parameter family of generalized Cantor sets C(m,a) introduced in Deﬁni-
tion 2.28 and whose basic properties are described in Proposition 2.29.

6Then, it clearly has at least two complex conjugate nonreal complex dimensions.

Theorem 2.40. Let D ∈ (0, 1) be a given real number, and let (mi)i≥1 be

and let C(mi,ai) be the corresponding generalized Cantor sets (see

(2.6.13)
and moreover, all the points on the critical line {Re s = D} are nonremovable sin-
gularities of ζA,Ω; in other words, the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is also maximally
hyperfractal (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.38(iii) above).

D(ζA,Ω) = Dmer(ζA,Ω),

Finally, the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is Minkowski nondegenerate, in the

sense that

0 < MD

∗ (A, Ω) ≤ M∗D(A, Ω) < ∞.

Theorem 2.40 admits a partial extension. If instead of condition (2.6.11) we
assume that mi → ∞ as i → ∞, then (2.6.13) still holds, and, moreover, all of the
points of the critical line are nonremovable singularities of ζA. Furthermore, the
fractal drum (A, Ω) is Minkowski nondegenerate.

We shall need the following lemma, which states a simple scaling property of the
tube functions and Minkowski contents of RFDs. We note that Relation (2.6.15)
below yields a partial extension of [ˇZu2, Proposition 4.4.]. Compare also with
the scaling property of the corresponding distance zeta function ζA,Ω, obtained in
Theorem 2.16.

Lemma 2.41. (a) Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN . Then, for any

ﬁxed λ > 0 and for all t > 0, we have that
(λA)t ∩ λΩ = λ(At/λ ∩ Ω),

(2.6.14)
Furthermore, for any real parameter r ∈ R, we have the following scaling (or
homogeneity) properties of the relative upper and lower Minkowski contents:
∗(A, Ω).

M∗r(λA, λΩ) = λrM∗r(A, Ω), Mr

|(λA)t ∩ λΩ| = λN|At/λ ∩ Ω|.

∗(λA, λΩ) = λrMr

(b) If A is a generalized Cantor set C(m,a) (see Deﬁnition 2.28), then

where

|(λC(m,a))t ∩ (0, λ)| = t1−D(Gλ(log t−1) − 2tD),

Gλ(τ ) := λDG(τ + log λ)

and G is the T -periodic function deﬁned in Equation (2.6.3) of Proposition 2.29.

38

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

Proof. (a) Scaling the set At ∩ Ω by the factor λ, we obtain λ(At ∩ Ω). On
the other hand, the same result is then obtained as an intersection of the scaled
sets (λA)λt and λΩ; that is,

λ(At ∩ Ω) = (λA)λt ∩ λΩ.

The ﬁrst equality in (2.6.14) now follows by replacing t with t/λ. The second one
is an immediate consequence of the ﬁrst one. We also have

M∗r(λA, λΩ) = lim sup
t→0+

= λN lim sup

|(λA)t ∩ λΩ|

The second equality in (2.6.15) is proved in the same way, but by now using the
lower limit instead of the upper limit.

(b) In the case of the generalized Cantor set, we use (2.6.14) with N = 1 and

Proposition 2.29:

|(λC(m,a))t ∩ (0, λ) = λ|C(m,a)

t/λ ∩ (0, 1)| = λ(cid:16) t

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Relative tube zeta functions have a scaling property which is analogous to that
obtained for the tube zeta functions of bounded sets. We leave the proof to the
interested reader.

Proposition 2.42 (Scaling property of relative tube zeta functions). Let (A, Ω)
be a relative fractal drum and let δ > 0. Let us denote by ˜ζA,Ω;δ(s) the associated
relative fractal zeta function deﬁned by Equation (2.4.1). Then, for any λ > 0, we
have D(˜ζλA,λΩ;λδ) = D(˜ζA,Ω;δ) = dimB(A, Ω) and

(2.6.16)

˜ζλA,λΩ;λδ(s) = λs ˜ζA,Ω;δ(s),

for all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimB(A, Ω). Furthermore, if ω ∈ C is a simple pole of
˜ζA,Ω;δ, where ˜ζA,Ω;δ is meromophically extended to an open connected neighborhood
of the critical line (as ususal, we keep the same notation for the extended function),
then

(2.6.17)

res(˜ζλA,λΩ;λδ , ω) = λω res(˜ζA,Ω;δ , ω).

In the proof of Theorem 2.40, we shall use the following simple fact.

If a
function G(τ ) = H(τ, τ, . . . ) is transcendentally quasiperiodic with respect to a
sequence of quasiperiods (Ti)i≥1, it is clear that for any ﬁxed sequence of real
numbers d = (di)i≥1, the corresponding function

Gd(τ ) := H(d1 + τ, d2 + τ, . . . )

is quasiperiodic with respect to the same sequence of quasiperiods (Ti)i≥1.

Proof of Theorem 2.40. Step 1: First of all, note that the generalized Can-

where

G(τ ) :=

|Ωi|DGi(log |Ωi| + τ ),

and the functions Gi = Gi(τ ) are Ti-periodic, with Ti := log 1/ai, for all i ≥ 1.
This shows that G(τ ) = H(τ, τ, . . . ), where

H((τi)i≥1) :=

∞Xi=1

|Ωi|D Gi(log |Ωi| + τi).

Note that the last series is well deﬁned, and that so is the series deﬁning G(τ ).
Indeed, letting Mi = M∗D(C(mi,ai)) and using Proposition 2.29, we see that
(1 − ai) ≤ C m1−D

0 < Gi(τ ) ≤ Mi =(cid:18) 2(mi − 1)

On the other hand, since (A1, Ω1) ⊃ (A, Ω), we can use Lemma 2.41(a) (with

Step 2: Let n be any ﬁxed positive integer. Since the set of real numbers

{log m1, . . . , log mn}

40

2. BASIC PROPERTIES OF RELATIVE DISTANCE AND TUBE ZETA FUNCTIONS

is rationally independent, we conclude from Baker’s theorem (see Theorem 2.30
above or [Ba, Theorem 2.1]) that the set of numbers {1, log m1, . . . , log mn} is alge-
braically independent. Dividing all these numbers by D, and using D = (log mi)/Ti,
where Ti = log(1/ai) for all i ≥ 1 (see Proposition 2.29), we deduce that

n 1

is algebraically independent as well. Since n is arbitrary, this proves that the
relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is transcendentally ∞-quasiperiodic, in the sense of
Deﬁnition 2.37.

Step 3: To prove the last claim, note that the critical line {Re s = D} contains
the union of the set of poles Pi = D + pi iZ of the tube zeta functions ˜ζAi,Ωi,
i ≥ 1. Since the integers mi are all distinct, we have that mi → ∞ as i → ∞,
and therefore, pi = 2π/Ti = 2πD/ log mi → 0. This proves that the union ∪i≥1Pi,
as a set of nonisolated singularities of ˜ζA,Ω =Pi≥1
˜ζAi,Ωi , is dense in the critical
line {Re s = D}. (Indeed, it is easy to deduce from the deﬁnitions that the subset
of nonremovable singularities of ζA,Ω along the critical line L := {Re s = D} is
closed in L and, hence, must coincide with L since it is also dense in L; see the
proof of [LapRˇZu2, Theorem 5.3].) It follows, in particular, that (2.6.13) holds,
as desired.
(cid:3)

It is noteworthy that the sequence M∗D(C(mi,ai), (0, 1)) appearing in Theo-
rem 2.40 is divergent. More precisely, it is easy to deduce from the equality in
(2.6.18) that

M∗D(C(mi,ai), (0, 1)) ∼ (2mi)1−D as

i → ∞.

The conditions of Theorem 2.40 are satisﬁed if, for example, mi

:= pi for
all i ≥ 1 (that is, (mi)i≥1 is the sequence of prime numbers (pi)i≥1, written in
increasing order), and if C1 := 1 and ci := 2−i for every i ≥ 1.

CHAPTER 3

Embeddings into higher-dimensional spaces

In this chapter, we obtain useful results concerning relative fractal drums and
bounded subsets of RN embedded into higher-dimensional spaces. In particular, we
show that the complex dimensions (and their multiplicities) of a bounded set (or,
more generally, of a relative fractal drum) are independent of the dimension of the
ambient space. (See Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.10.) In addition, we apply some
of these results in order to calculate the complex dimensions of the Cantor dust.
(See Example 3.15.)

3.1. Embeddings of bounded sets

We begin this section by stating a result which (along with the subsequent

result, Theorem 3.2) will be key to the developments in this chapter.

Proposition 3.1. Let A ⊂ RN be a bounded set and let D := dimBA. Then,
for the tube zeta functions of A and A × {0} ⊆ RN +1, the following equality holds:

(3.1.1)

˜ζA×{0}(s; δ) = 2Z π/2

0

˜ζA(s; δ sin τ )
sins−N−1 τ

dτ,

for all s ∈ C such that Re s > D.

Proof. First of all, it is well-known and easy to check that dimB(A × {0}) =
dimBA, from which we conclude that the tube zeta functions of A and A ×{0} are
both holomorphic in the right half-plane {Re s > D}. Furthermore, we use the fact
(see [Res, Proposition 6]) that for every t > 0, we have

(3.1.2)

|(A × {0})t|N +1 = 2Z t

0 |A√t2−u2|N du,

where, as before, | · |N denotes the N -dimensional Lebesgue measure. (See also
the proof of Lemma 3.5 in §3.2 below.) After having made the change of variable
u = t cos v, this yields

(3.1.3)

|(A × {0})t|N +1 = 2tZ π/2

0

41

|At sin v|N sin v dv.

42

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

Finally, for the tube zeta function of A × {0}, we can write successively:

˜ζA×{0}(s; δ) =Z δ

where we have used the Fubini–Tonelli theorem in order to justify the interchange
of integrals (in the third equality), as well as made another change of variable
(in the fourth equality), namely, τ = t sin v. This completes the proof of the
proposition.
(cid:3)

In the following theorem, Γ(t) :=R +∞

is the usual gamma function, meromorphically extended to all of C.

xt−1e−x dx, initially deﬁned for t > 0,

Theorem 3.2. Let A ⊆ RN be a bounded set and let D := dimBA. Then, we
have the following equality between ˜ζA, the tube zeta function of A, and ˜ζAM , the
tube zeta function of AM := A × {0} ··· × {0}× ⊆ RN +M , with M ∈ N:

(3.1.4)

initially valid for all s ∈ C such that Re s > D. Here, the error function E(s) :=
E(s; δ), (initially deﬁned in the case when M = 1 by the integral on the right-hand
side of Equation (3.1.7) below) admits a meromorphic extension to all of C. The
possible poles (in C) of E(s; δ) are located at sk := N + 2 + 2k for every k ∈ N0, and
all of them are simple. (It follows that ˜ζA is well deﬁned at each sk.) Moreover, we
have that for each k ∈ N0,

(3.1.5)

res(E(· ; δ), sk) =

(−1)k+1 (√π)M
k! Γ(cid:0) M

2 − k(cid:1) ˜ζA(sk; δ).

(We refer to Theorem 3.3 below for more precise information about the domain
of validity of the approximate functional equation (3.1.4), and to Corollary 3.4 for
information about the relationship between the visible poles of ˜ζA and ˜ζAM .) More
speciﬁcally, if M is even, then all of the poles sk of E(s; δ) are canceled for k ≥ M/2;
i.e., the corresponding residues in (3.1.5) are equal to zero. On the other hand, if
M is odd, then there are no such cancellations and all of the residues in (3.1.5) are
nonzero; so that all the sk’s are (simple) poles of E(s; δ) in that case.

Proof. We will prove the theorem in the case when M = 1. The general
case then follows immediately by induction. From Proposition 3.1, we have that
formula (3.1.1) holds for all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimBA. In turn, this latter

where B denotes the Euler beta function and

(3.1.6)

(3.1.7)

(3.1.8)

By using the functional equation which links the beta function with the gamma
function (namely, B(x, y) = Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x + y) for all x, y > 0 and hence, upon
meromorphic continuation, for all x, y ∈ C), we obtain that (3.1.4) holds (with
M = 1) for all s ∈ C such that Re s > dimBA.
By looking at E(s; δ), we see that the integrand is holomorphic for every v ∈
(0, π/2) since the integralR δ
δ sin v τ s−N−1|Aτ|N dτ is equal to ˜ζA(s; δ)− ˜ζA(s; δ sin v),
which is an entire function. Furthermore, if we assume that Re s < N + 1, then
since τ 7→ τ Re s−N−1 is decreasing, we have the following estimate:
sinN +1−Re s v dvZ δ

(1 − sin v) dv

From this we conclude that for s0 ∈ {Re s < N +1}, the condition (3′) of Remark 1.4
is satisﬁed, which implies, in light of Theorem 1.3, that E(s; δ) is holomorphic on
the open left half-plane {Re s < N + 1}.
On the other hand, we know that both of the tube zeta functions ˜ζA and
˜ζAM are holomorphic on {Re s > dimBA} ⊇ {Re s > N}. The fact that E(s; δ)
is meromorphic on C, as well as the statement about its poles, now follows from
Equation (3.1.4) (with M = 1) and the fact that the gamma function is nowhere
vanishing in C. (In fact, 1/Γ(s) is an entire function with zeros at the nonpositive
integers.) More speciﬁcally, the locations of the poles of E(s; δ) must coincide with
the locations of the poles sk = N + 2 + 2k, for k ∈ N0, of Γ((N − s)/2 + 1) since the
left-hand side of (3.1.4) is holomorphic on {Re s > dimBA} and because ˜ζA(sk) > 0
(since it is deﬁned as the integral of a positive function). (Note that since N ≥ D,
we have sk > D, and hence, ˜ζA is well deﬁned at sk, for each k ∈ N0.)
Finally, by multiplying (3.1.4) by (s − sk), taking the limit as s → sk and then
using the fact that the residue of the gamma function at −k is equal to (−1)k/k!,
we deduce that (3.1.5) holds, as desired. Furthermore, if M is odd, there are no

44

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

cancellations between the poles of the numerator and of the denominator in (3.1.4)
since an integer cannot be both even and odd; i.e., the residues are nonzero for each
k ∈ N0. On the other hand, if M is even, then it is clear that all of the residues
at sk for k ≥ M/2 are equal to zero, i.e., the corresponding poles at sk cancel
out with the poles of the denominator in (3.1.4). This concludes the proof of the
theorem.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.2 has as an important consequence, namely, the fact that the notion

of complex dimensions does not depend on the dimension of the ambient space.

Theorem 3.3. Let A ⊆ RN be a bounded set and AM be its embedding into
RN +M , with M ∈ N. Then, the tube zeta function ˜ζA of A has a meromorphic
extension to a given connected open neighborhood U of the critical line {Re s =
dimBA} if and only if the analogous statement is true for the tube zeta function
˜ζAM of AM . Furthermore, in that case, the approximate functional equation (3.1.4)
In addition, the multisets of the poles of ˜ζA and
remains valid for all s ∈ U .
˜ζAM located in U coincide; i.e., P( ˜ζA, U ) = P(˜ζAM , U ).1 Consequently, neither
the values nor the multiplicities of the complex dimensions of A depend on the
dimension of the ambient space.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.2 and the principle of an-
alytic continuation. More speciﬁcally, identity (3.1.4) is valid for all s ∈ C such
that Re s > dimBA and the function E(s; δ) is meromorphic on C. Furthermore,
according to Theorem 3.2, the poles of E(s; δ) belong to {Re s ≥ N + 2}, which
implies that the function s 7→ E(s; δ) is holomorphic on {Re s < N + 2}. Iden-
tity (3.1.4) then remains valid if any of the two zeta functions involved (namely, ˜ζA
or ˜ζAM ) has a meromorphic continuation to some connected open neighborhood of
the critical line {Re s = dimBA}. This completes the proof of the theorem.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.4. Let A ⊆ RN be a bounded set (with D := dimBA) such
that its tube zeta function ˜ζA has a meromorphic continuation to a connected open
neighborhood U of the critical line {Re s = dimBA}. Furthermore, suppose that
s = D is a simple pole of ˜ζA. Let AM ⊆ RN +M be the embedding of A into RN +M ,
as in Theorem 3.2. Then

res(˜ζAM , D) =

res(˜ζA, D).

We point out here that the above corollary is compatible with the dimensional
invariance of the normalized Minkowski content, obtained in [Res]. More speciﬁ-
cally, if in the above corollary, we assume, in addition, that D is the only pole of the
tube zeta function of A on the critical line {Re s = D} (i.e., D is the only complex
dimension of A with real part D), then, according to [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.2],
A and A × {0} are Minkowski measurable, with Minkowski dimension D := D and
Minkowski contents satisfying the following identity:

3.2. Embeddings of relative fractal drums

The results obtained in the previous section in the context of bounded subsets
of RN can also be obtained in the more general context of relative fractal drums
(RFDs) in RN . More speciﬁcally, let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN and
let

(A × {0}, Ω × (−1, 1))

be its natural embedding into RN +1. We want to connect the relative tube zeta
functions of these two RFDs; the following lemma will be needed for this purpose.
Lemma 3.5. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN and ﬁx δ ∈ (0, 1).

Then we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−1, 1))(cid:12)(cid:12)N +1 = 2Z δ

0 |A√δ2−u2 ∩ Ω|N du.

Proof. We proceed much as in the proof of [Res, Proposition 6]. Namely, we

V := {(x, y) : dN +1((x, y), A × {0}) ≤ δ} ∩ {(x, y) : x ∈ Ω,|y| < 1} ,

let (x, y) ∈ RN × R ≡ RN +1 and deﬁne
(3.2.2)
where for any k ∈ N, dk denotes the Euclidean distance in Rk. It is clear that the
that for a ﬁxed y ∈ [−δ, δ], we have

following equality holds: dN +1((x, y), A × {0}) = pdN (x, A)2 + y2. This implies

(3.2.1)

(3.2.3)

(Note that if |y| > δ, then Vy is empty.) Finally, Fubini’s theorem implies that

which completes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

The above lemma will eventually yield (in Theorem 3.10 below) an RFD analog
of Proposition 3.1 from §3.1 above. First, however, we will show that the upper
and lower relative box dimensions of an RFD are independent of the ambient space
dimension.

Proposition 3.6. Let (A, Ω) be an RFD in RN and let

(3.2.4)
be its embedding into RN +M , for some M ∈ N. Then we have that
(3.2.5)

(A, Ω)M := (AM , Ω × (−1, 1)M )

dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Ω)M

and

(3.2.6)

dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Ω)M .

46

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

Proof. We only prove the proposition in the case when M = 1, from which
the general result then easily follows by induction. It is clear that for 0 < δ < 1,
we have

(A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−1, 1)) ⊆ (A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−δ, δ))

⊆ (Aδ ∩ Ω) × (−δ, δ);

so that

(3.2.7)

|(A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−1, 1))|N +1 ≤ 2δ|Aδ ∩ Ω|N .
This observation, in turn, implies that for every r ∈ R, we have
2|Aδ ∩ Ω|N
(3.2.8)

|(A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−1, 1))|N +1

.

δN +1−r

δN−r

Furthermore, by successively taking the upper and lower limits as δ → 0+ in
Equation (3.2.8) just above, we obtain the following inequalities, involving the
r-dimensional upper and lower relative Minkowski contents of the RFDs (A, Ω)1
and (A, Ω), respectively:

(3.2.9)

M∗r(A, Ω)1 ≤ 2M∗r(A, Ω)

and Mr

∗(A, Ω)1 ≤ 2Mr

∗(A, Ω).

In light of the deﬁnition of the relative upper and lower box (or Minkowski) dimen-
sions (see Equation (1.4.3) and the text surrounding it), we deduce that

(3.2.10)

dimB(A, Ω)1 ≤ dimB(A, Ω)

and dimB(A, Ω)1 ≤ dimB(A, Ω).

On the other hand, for geometric reasons, we have that

(Aδ/2 ∩ Ω) × −

Much as before, this inequality implies that for every r ∈ R, we have

2N−r(δ/2)N−r ≤ |(A × {0})δ ∩ (Ω × (−1, 1))|N +1

(3.2.12)

(3.2.11)

and by successively taking the upper and lower limits as δ → 0+, we obtain that

and

2N−r

Finally, this completes the proof because (again in light of Equation (1.4.3) and
the text surrounding it) (3.2.13) implies the reverse inequalities for the upper and
lower relative box dimensions in (3.2.10).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.7. Observe that it follows from Proposition 3.6 (combined with
part (b) of Theorem 2.1) that the RFDs (A, Ω) and (A, Ω)M have the same upper
Minkowski dimension, dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Ω)M , and hence, the same critical
line {Re s = dimB(A, Ω)}. This fact will be used implicitly in the statement of
Proposition 3.8 as well as in the statements of Theorems 3.9 and 3.10 just below.

3.2. EMBEDDINGS OF RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS

47

We can now state the desired results for embedded RFDs and their relative zeta
functions. In light of Lemma 3.5 and Proposition 3.6, the proofs follow the same
steps as in the corresponding results established in §3.1 about bounded subsets of
RN (namely, Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.2, respectively), and for this reason,
we will omit them.

Proposition 3.8. Fix δ ∈ (0, 1) and let (A, Ω) be an RFD in RN , with D :=
dimB(A, Ω). Then, for the relative tube zeta functions of (A, Ω) and (A, Ω)1 :=
(A × {0}, Ω × (−1, 1)), the following equality holds:

Theorem 3.9. Fix δ ∈ (0, 1) and let (A, Ω) be an RFD in RN , with D :=

tion of (A, Ω), and ˜ζAM ,Ω×(−1,1)M , the tube zeta function of the relative fractal drum

initially valid for all s ∈ C such that Re s > D. (See Theorem 3.10 for more precise
information about the domain of validity of the approximate functional equation
(3.2.15).) Here, the error function E(s) := E(s; δ) is meromorphic on all of C.
Furthermore, the possible poles (in C) of E(s; δ) are located at sk := N + 2 + 2k for
every k ∈ N0, and all of them are simple. (It follows that ˜ζA is well deﬁned at each
sk.) Moreover, we have that for each k ∈ N0,
(3.2.16)

res(E(· ; δ), sk) =

(−1)k+1 (√π)M
k! Γ(cid:0) M

2 − k(cid:1) ˜ζA,Ω;δ(sk).

More speciﬁcally, if M is even, then all of the poles sk of E(s; δ) are canceled for
k ≥ M/2; i.e., the corresponding residues in (3.2.16) are equal to zero. On the
other hand, if M is odd, then there are no such cancellations and all of the residues
in (3.2.16) are nonzero; so that all of the sk’s are (simple) poles of E(s; δ) in that
case.

We deduce at once from Theorem 3.9 the following key result about the in-
variance of the complex dimensions of a relative fractal drum with respect to the
dimension of the ambient space. This result extends Theorem 3.3 to general RFDs.

Theorem 3.10. Let (A, Ω) be an RFD in RN and let the RFD (A, Ω)M :=
(AM , Ω× (−1, 1)M ) be its embedding into RN +M , for some M ∈ N. Then, the tube
zeta function ˜ζA,Ω := ˜ζA,Ω of (A, Ω) has a meromorphic extension to a given open
connected neighborhood U of the critical line {Re s = dimB(A, Ω)} if and only if the
analogous statement is true for the tube zeta function ˜ζ(A,Ω)M := ˜ζAM ,Ω×(−1,1)M of
(A, Ω)M . (See Remark 3.7 just above.) Furthermore, in that case, the approximate
functional equation (3.2.15) remains valid for all s ∈ U . In addition, the multisets
of the poles of ˜ζA,Ω and ˜ζ(A,Ω)M belonging to U coincide; i.e.,

(3.2.17)

P(˜ζA,Ω, U ) = P(˜ζ(A,Ω)M , U ).

48

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

Consequently, neither the values nor the multiplicities of the complex dimensions
of the RFD (A, Ω) depend on the dimension of the ambient space.

Remark 3.11. In the above discussion about embedding RFDs into higher-
dimensional spaces, we can also make similar observations if we embed (A, Ω) as
a ‘one-sided’ RFD, for example of the form (A × {0}, Ω × (0, 1)), a fact which can
be more useful when decomposing a relative fractal drum into a union of relative
fractal subdrums in order to compute its distance (or tube) zeta function. This
observation follows immediately from the above results for ‘two-sided’ embeddings
of RFDs since, by symmetry, we have

(3.2.18)

˜ζA×{0},Ω×(−1,1)(s) = 2 ˜ζA×{0},Ω×(0,1)(s).

We note that when using the above formulas, one only has to be careful to take
into account the factor 2. Furthermore, we can also embed (A, Ω) as

(A × {0}, Ω × (−α, α))

or

(A × {0}, Ω × (0, α)),

for some α > 0, but in that case, the corresponding formulas will only be valid for
all δ ∈ (0, α).

We could now use the functional equation (2.4.2) connecting the tube and
distance zeta functions, in order to translate the above results in terms of ζA,Ω, the
(relative) distance zeta function of the RFD (A, Ω). However, we will instead use
another approach because it gives some additional information about the resulting
error function. More speciﬁcally, consider the Mellin zeta function of a relative
fractal drum (A, Ω) deﬁned by

(3.2.19)

ζM

A,Ω(s) :=Z +∞

ts−N−1|At ∩ Ω| dt,

for all s ∈ C located in a suitable vertical strip. In fact, in light of [LapRaˇZu5,
Theorem 5.7] (see also [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.7]), the above Lebesgue inte-
gral is absolutely convergent (and hence, convergent) for all s ∈ C such that
Re s ∈ (dimB(A, Ω), N ). Moreover, the relative distance and Mellin zeta functions
of (A, Ω) are connected by the functional equation
ζA,Ω(s) = (N − s)ζM

(3.2.20)
on every open connected set U ⊆ C to which any of the two zeta functions has
a meromorphic continuation. Observe that in (3.2.20), the parameter δ is absent.
Indeed, this means implicitly that the functional equation (3.2.20) is valid only for
the parameters δ > 0 for which the inclusion Ω ⊆ Aδ is satisﬁed; that is, when

A,Ω(s),

ζA,Ω;δ(s) =RΩ d(x, A)s−N dx is satisﬁed.

We will now embed the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) of RN into RN +1 as

(A × {0}, Ω × R).

Strictly speaking, this is not a relative fractal drum in RN +1 since there does not
exist a δ > 0 such that Ω × R ⊆ (A × {0})δ. On the other hand, observe that
Lemma 3.5 is now valid for every δ > 0; that is,

(3.2.21)

for all s ∈ C such that Re s < N . In light of Theorem 1.3 and Remark 1.4, the latter

the left half-plane {Re s < N}. Therefore, it follows that F (s) is holomorphic in
the vertical strip {dimB(A, Ω) < Re s < N} and the proof of the proposition is
complete.

(cid:3)

In light of the above proposition, we continue to use the convenient notation
ζM
A×{0},,Ω×R for the integral (3.2.22) although, as was noted earlier, (A×{0}, Ω× R)
is not technically a relative fractal drum in RN +1. The following result is the
counterpart of Theorem 3.2 in the present, more general context.

Theorem 3.13. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN such that D :=
dimB(A, Ω) < N . Then, for every a > 0, the following approximate functional
equation holds:

and admits a meromorphic extension to all of C, with a set of simple poles equal to
{N + 2k : k ∈ N0}.

50

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

Moreover, Equation (3.2.23) remains valid on any connected open neighborhood
of the critical line {Re s = D} to which ζA,Ω (or, equivalently, ζA×{0},Ω×(−a,a)) can
be meromorphically continued.

Proof. In a completely analogous way as in the proof of Theorem 3.2, we

obtain that

(3.2.25)

˜ζA×{0},Ω×R;δ(s) =

√πΓ(cid:0) N−s
Γ(cid:0) N +1−s

2 + 1(cid:1)
2 + 1(cid:1) ˜ζA,,Ω;δ(s) + ˜E(s; δ),

now valid for all δ > 0 (see Equation (3.2.21) above and the discussion preceding it).
Furthermore, the error function ˜E(s) := ˜E(s; δ) is holomorphic on {Re s < N + 1}
and

(3.2.26)

| ˜E(s, δ)| ≤ 2δRe s−N|Aδ ∩ Ω|N(cid:16) π

2 − 1(cid:17)

for all s ∈ C such that Re s < N + 1. See the proof of Theorem 3.2 and Equation
(3.1.8) for the derivation of the above estimate. The estimate (3.2.26) now implies
that the sequence of holomorphic functions ˜E(· ; n) tends to 0 as n → ∞, uniformly
on every compact subset of {Re s < N}, since |An ∩ Ω| = |Ω| for all n suﬃciently
large. Furthermore, we also have that ˜ζA,Ω;n → ζM
(3.2.27)
A×{0},Ω×R

˜ζA×{0},Ω×R(s; n) → ζM

as n → ∞,

A,Ω and

uniformly on every compact subset of {D < Re s < N}. This implies that by
taking the limit in (3.2.25) as δ → +∞, we obtain the following functional equality
between holomorphic functions:

(3.2.28)

ζM
A×{0},Ω×R(s) =

√πΓ(cid:0) N−s

Γ(cid:0) N +1−s

valid in the vertical strip {D < Re s < N}. (We can obtain this equality even more
directly by applying Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem to a counterpart
of (3.2.14).)

Moreover, according to (3.2.20), we have the functional equation

(3.2.29)

ζM
A×{0},Ω×R(s) =

from which we deduce that the right-hand side admits a meromorphic extension
to the right half-plane {Re s > D}, with simple poles located at the simple poles
of Γ((N − s)/2); that is, at sk := N + 2k for all k ∈ N0. (Observe that in the
above ratio of gamma functions, there are no cancellations between the poles of
the numerator and of the denominator; indeed, an integer cannot be both even and
odd.) From this we conclude that by the principle of analytic continuation, the
same property also holds for the left-hand side of (3.2.29) and, furthermore, the
left-hand side has a meromorphic extension to any domain U ⊆ C to which the
right-hand side can be meromorphically extended.
In order to complete the proof of the theorem, we now observe that for any

a > 0, since

(cid:12)(cid:12)(A × {0})t ∩ (Ω × R)(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(A × {0})t ∩ (Ω × (−a, a))(cid:12)(cid:12)

+(cid:12)(cid:12)(A × {0})t ∩ (Ω × (R \ (−a, a)))(cid:12)(cid:12),

3.2. EMBEDDINGS OF RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUMS

the left-hand side of (3.2.29) can be split into two parts:

A×{0},Ω×R(s) = ζM

−

E(s; a)

.

We then combine this observation with (3.2.29) to obtain (3.2.23). In light of part
(a) of Theorem 2.1, we know that ζA×{0},Ω×(−a,a)(s) is holomorphic on the open
right half-plane {Re s > D}. Furthermore, much as in the proof of Proposition
3.12, we can show that E(s) := E(s; a) deﬁnes a holomorphic function on the
open left half-plane {Re s < N}. This fact, together with the functional equation
(3.2.23), now ensures that E(s; a) admits a meromorphic continuation to all of C,
with a set of simple poles equal to {N + 2k : k ∈ N0}. (Note that ζA,Ω(s) > 0
for all s ∈ [N, +∞), which implies that there are no zero-pole cancellations on the
right-hand side of (3.2.23).) This completes the proof of Theorem 3.13.

(cid:3)

We note that in Example 3.15 below, we actually want to embed (A, Ω) into
RN +1, as (A×{0}, Ω× (0, a)) for some a > 0. By looking at the proof of the above
theorem and using a suitable symmetry argument, we can obtain the following
result, which deals with this type of embedding.

Theorem 3.14. Let (A, Ω) be a relative fractal drum in RN such that D :=

dimB(A, Ω) < N . Then, the following approximate functional equation holds:

initially valid for all s ∈ C such that Re s > D. Here, the error function E(s) :=
E(s; a) is initially given (for all s ∈ C such that Re s < N ) by

(3.2.31) E(s; a) := (s−N−1)Z +∞

a

ts−N−2|(A × {0})t ∩ Ω × (R \ (0, a))|N +1dt,

and admits a meromorphic continuation to all of C, with a set of simple poles equal
to {N + 2k : k ∈ N0}.
Moreover, Equation (3.2.30) remains valid on any connected open neighborhood
of the critical line {Re s = D} to which ζA,Ω (or, equivalently, ζA×{0},Ω×(0,a)) can
be meromorphically continued.

Example 3.15. (Complex dimensions of the Cantor dust RFD). In this ex-
ample, we will consider the relative fractal drum consisting of the Cantor dust
contained in [0, 1]2 and compute its distance zeta function. More precisely, let
A := C(1/3) × C(1/3) be the Cantor dust (i.e., the Cartesian product of the ternary
Cantor set C := C1/3 by itself) and let Ω := (0, 1)2. We will not obtain for ζA
an explicit formula in a closed form but we will instead use Theorem 3.2 in order
to deduce that the distance zeta function of the Cantor dust has a meromorphic
continuation to all of C.

More interestingly, we will also show that the set of complex dimensions of the
Cantor dust is the union of (a nontrivial subset of) a periodic set contained in the
critical line {Re s = log3 4} and the set of complex dimensions of the Cantor set
(which is a periodic set contained in the critical line {Re s = log3 2}). This fact is

(3.2.30)

ζA×{0},Ω×(0,a)(s) =

2 (cid:1)
√πΓ(cid:0) N−s
(cid:1) ζA,Ω(s) + E(s; a),
2Γ(cid:0) N +1−s

2

52

3. EMBEDDINGS INTO HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL SPACES

signiﬁcant because it shows that in this case, the distance (or tube) zeta function
also detects the ‘lower-dimensional’ fractal nature of the Cantor dust.

Note that, as is well known, the Minkowski dimension of the RFD (or Cantor
string) (C, (0, 1)) is given by dimB(C, (0, 1)) = log3 2 (see [Lap-vFr1, §1.2.2]. Fur-
thermore, it will follow from the discussion below that, as might be expected since
(A, Ω) = (C, (0, 1)) × (C, (0, 1))),
(3.2.32)

dimB(A, Ω) = 2 dimB(C, (0, 1)) = log3 4.

Consequently, the critical line of the RFD (C, (0, 1)) in R (the Cantor string RFD)
is the vertical line {Re s = log3 2}, while the critical line of the Cantor dust, viewed
as the RFD (A, Ω) in R2, is the vertical line {Re s = log3 4}, as was stated in the
previous paragraph.
The construction of the RFD (A, Ω) can be carried out by beginning with the
unit square and removing the open middle-third ‘cross’, and then iterating this
procedure ad inﬁnitum. This procedure implies that we can subdivide the Cantor
dust into a countable union of RFDs which are scaled down versions of two base
(or generating) RFDs, (A1, Ω1) and (A2, Ω2). The ﬁrst one of these base RFDs,
(A1, Ω1), is deﬁned by Ω1 := (0, 1/3)2 and by A1 being the union of the four vertices
of the closure of Ω1 (namely, of the square [0, 1/3]2). Furthermore, the second base
RFD is deﬁned by Ω2 := (0, 1/3)× (0, 1/6) and by A2 being the ternary Cantor set
contained in [0, 1/3] × {0}.
At the n-th level of the iteration, we have exactly 4n−1 RFDs of the type
(anA1, anΩ1) and 8 · 4n−1 RFDs of the type (anA2, anΩ2), where an := 3−n for
each n ∈ N. This observation, together with the scaling property of the relative
distance zeta function (see Theorem 2.16), yields successively (for all s ∈ C with
Re s suﬃciently large):

Cantor string and (by [Lap-vFr3, Eq. (1.29), p. 22]) ζLCS (s) = 1/(3s − 2), for all
s ∈ C. From Theorem 3.14 and the scaling property of the relative distance zeta

Formula (3.2.37) implies that P(ζA,Ω, the set of all complex dimensions (in C) of
the ‘relative’ Cantor dust, is a subset of

(3.2.38)

(cid:18)log3 4 +

and consists of simple poles of ζA,Ω. Of course, we know that log3 4 ∈ P(ζA,Ω), but
we can only conjecture that the other poles on the critical line {Re s = log3 4} are in
P(ζA,Ω) since it may happen that there are some zero-pole cancellations in (3.2.37).
On the other hand, since it is known that the Cantor dust is not Minkowski measur-
able (see [FaZe]), we can deduce from [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.2] that there must
exist at least two other (necessarily nonreal) poles s±k0 = log3 4 ± 2k0πi
log 3 of ζA,Ω,
for some k0 ∈ N. (Indeed, according to [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.2], D := log3 4
cannot be the only complex dimension of (A, Ω) on the critical line {Re s = D}
since otherwise, the Cantor dust would be Minkowski measurable, which is a con-
tradiction.) Based on (3.2.37), we cannot even claim that 0 ∈ P(ζA,Ω) for sure, but
we can see that all of the principal complex dimensions of the Cantor set are ele-
ments of P(ζA,Ω); i.e., log3 2 + 2π
log 3 iZ ⊆ P(ζA,Ω)). We conjecture that we also have
log3 4 + 2π
log 3 iZ.
The above example can be easily generalized to the case of Cartesian products
of any ﬁnite number of generalized Cantor sets (as given by Deﬁnition 2.28), in
which case we conjecture that the set of complex dimensions of the product is
contained in the union of the sets of complex dimensions of each of the factors,
modulo any zero-pole cancellations which may occur.
In light of this and other
similar examples, it would be interesting to obtain some results about zero-free
regions for fractal zeta functions. We leave this problem as a possible subject for
further investigations.

log 3 iZ ⊆ P(ζA,Ω); that is, we conjecture that Pc(ζA,Ω) = log3 4 + 2π

CHAPTER 4

Zeta functions of relative fractal sprays and

generating principal complex dimensions of any

multiplicity

In this chapter, we consider a special type of RFDs, called relative fractal sprays,
and study their distance zeta functions. We then illustrate our results by computing
the corresponding complex dimensions of relative Sierpi´nski sprays. More specif-
ically, we determine the complex dimensions (as well as the associated residues)
of the relative Sierpi´nski gasket (Example 4.12) and of the relative Sierpi´nski car-
pet (Example 4.15); we also consider higher-dimensional analogs of these exam-
ples, namely, the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFD (Example 4.14) and the
Sierpi´nski N -carpet RFD (Example 4.17).

4.1. Relative fractal sprays in RN

We now introduce the deﬁnition of relative fractal spray, which is very similar
to (but more general than) the notion of fractal spray (see [LapPo3], [Lap-vFr3,
Deﬁnition 13.2], [LapPe1–2] and [LapPeWi1–2]), itself a generalization of the
notion of (ordinary) fractal string [LapPo1–2, Lap1–3, Lap-vFr3].

Definition 4.1. Let (∂Ω0, Ω0) be a ﬁxed relative fractal drum in RN (which
we call the base relative fractal drum, or generating relative fractal drum), (λj )j≥0
a decreasing sequence of positive numbers (scaling factors), converging to zero, and
(bj)j≥0 a given sequence of positive integers (multiplicities). The associated relative
fractal spray is a relative fractal drum (A, Ω) obtained as the disjoint union of a
sequence of RFDs, F := {(∂Ωi, Ωi) : i ∈ N0}, where N0 := N ∪ {0}, such that each
Ωi can be obtained from λj Ω0 by a rigid motion in RN , and for each j ∈ N0 there
are precisely bj RFDs in the family F that can be obtained from λj Ω0 by a rigid
motion. Any relative fractal spray (A, Ω), generated by the base relative fractal
drum (or ‘basic shape’) Ω0 and the sequences of ‘scales’ (λj )j≥0 with associated
‘multiplicities’ (bj)≥0, is denoted by
(4.1.1)
The family F is called the skeleton of the spray. The distance zeta function ζA,Ω
of the relative fractal spray (A, Ω) is computed in Theorem 4.6 below.
If there exist λ ∈ (0, 1) and an integer b ≥ 2 such that λj = λj and bj = bj, for

(A, Ω) := Spray(Ω0, (λj )j≥0, (bj)≥0).

all j ∈ N0, then we simply write

(A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, λ, b).

Definition 4.2. The relative fractal spray (A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, (λj )j≥0, (bj)j≥0)
can be viewed as a relative fractal drum generated by (∂Ω0, Ω0) and a fractal string

55

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

L = (ℓj)j≥0, consisting of the decreasing sequence (λj )j≥0 of positive real num-
bers, in which each λj has multiplicity bj for every j ≥ 0. Thus, we can write
(A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0,L). It is also convenient to view the construction of (A, Ω) in
Deﬁnition 4.1 as the tensor product of the base relative fractal drum (A0, Ω0) and
the fractal string L:
(4.1.2)

(A, Ω) = (∂Ω0, Ω0) ⊗ L.

We can also deﬁne the tensor product of two (possibly unbounded) fractal strings
L1 = (ℓ1j)j≥1 and L2 = (ℓ2k)k≥1 as the following fractal string (note that here, L1
and L2 are viewed as nonincreasing sequences of positive numbers tending to zero,

but that we may haveP∞j=1 ℓ1j = +∞ orP∞k=1 ℓ2k = +∞):

(4.1.3)
By construction, the multiplicity of any l ∈ L1 ⊗ L2 is equal to the number of
ordered pairs of (ℓ1j, ℓ2k) in the Cartesian product L1 × L2 of multisets such that
l = ℓ1jℓ2k.

L1 ⊗ L2 := (ℓ1jℓ2k)j,k≥1.

Example 4.3. Let Ω0 := B1(0) be the open unit disk in the plane R2 and
A0 := ∂Ω0 the unit circle. Let L := (ℓj)j≥0 be the Cantor string. In other words,
L is the multiset consisting of lk = 3−k−1 with multiplicity 2k for each k ≥ 0. As
in Deﬁnition 4.2, we deﬁne the RFD (A, Ω) as the tensor product

(A, Ω) := (A0, Ω0) ⊗ L.

ζA,Ω(s) =

2kζ3−k−1(A0,Ω0)(s)

(4.1.4)

Then,

where in the last equality we have used Equation (2.1.9) with N = 2. It follows
that ζA,Ω has a meromorphic continuation to all of C given by the last expression
of (4.1.5). Therefore, we deduce that

(4.1.6)

P(ζA,Ω) = {0} ∪(cid:16) log3 2 +

2π

log 3 iZ(cid:17) ∪ {1},

dimP C ( ˜A, ˜Ω) = {1},

and all the complex dimensions are simple. The RFD (A, Ω) has a vertical se-
quence of equidistant complex dimensions (namely, {log3 2 + 2π
log 3 ik}k∈Z), while
there is only one principal complex dimension (namely, s = 1), and it is simple.
Using [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.2], we conclude that the RFD (A, Ω) is Minkowski
measurable.

We point out, however, that one can also show (by using the results and
techniques of [LapRaˇZu5] and [LapRaˇZu1, Chapter 5]) that the RFD (A, Ω)
is (strictly) subcritically Minkowski nonmeasurable in dimension d := log3 2, in a
sense speciﬁed in the just mentioned references. Heuristically, this means that it has
geometric oscillations of lower order d = log3 2, but none of leading order D = 1.

4.1. RELATIVE FRACTAL SPRAYS IN RN

57

We can easily modify the notion of relative fractal spray in Deﬁnition 4.1
in order to deal with a ﬁnite collection of K basic RFDs (or generating RFDs)
(∂Ω01, Ω01),. . . ,(∂Ω0K, Ω0K), where K is and integer ≥ 1, similarly as in [LapPo3],
[Lap-vFr3, Deﬁnition 13.2] (and [LapPe1–2, LapPeWi1–2]). A slightly more
general notion would consist in replacing (∂Ω0, Ω0) by any relative fractal drum
(A0, Ω0); see [LapRaˇZu1].

It is important to stress that, from our point of view, the sets Ωi in the deﬁnition
of a relative fractal spray (Deﬁnition 4.1) do not have to be ‘densely packed’. In
fact, in general, they cannot be ‘densely packed’, as indicated by Example 4.5(c)
below. They can just be viewed as the union of the disjoint family {(∂Ωi, Ωi)}i≥0
of RFDs in RN . The corresponding disjoint family of open sets {Ωi}i≥0 can even
be unbounded in RN , since its union does not have to be of ﬁnite N -dimensional
Lebesgue measure.

The following simple lemma provides necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a

relative fractal spray (A, Ω) to be such that |Ω| < ∞.

Lemma 4.4. Assume that (A, Ω) := Spray(Ω0, (λj )j≥0, (bj)≥0) in RN is a rel-

ative fractal spray. Then |Ω| < ∞ if and only if |Ω0| < ∞ and
(4.1.7)

bjλN

j < ∞.

∞Xj=0

In that case, we have

(4.1.8)

|Ω| = |Ω0|

bjλN

∞Xj=0

In particular, the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) is well deﬁned and dimB(A, Ω) ≤ N .
Proof. Let us prove the suﬃciency part. For Ωj = λj Ω0 we have |Ωj| =

|λjΩ0| = λN

j |Ω0|, and therefore,

|Ω| =

|Ωj| =

bj|λjΩ0| = |Ω0|

The proof of the necessity part is also easy and is therefore omitted.

(cid:3)

Example 4.5. Here, we provide a few simple examples of relative fractal sprays:

(a) The ternary Cantor set can be viewed as a relative fractal drum

(A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, 1/3, 2)

(called the Cantor relative fractal drum, or the relative Cantor fractal spray), gen-
erated by

(∂Ω0, Ω0) = ({1/3, 2/3} , (1/3, 2/3))

as the base relative fractal drum, λ = 1/3 and b = 2. Its relative box dimension
exists and is equal to D = log3 2. Of course, this is just an example of ordinary
fractal string, namely, the well-known Cantor string; see [Lap-vFr3, §1.1.2].

(b) The Sierpi´nski gasket can be viewed as a relative fractal drum (called the
Sierpi´nski relative fractal drum, or Sierpi´nski relative fractal spray), generated by

58

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

Figure 1. Left: The Sierpi´nski gasket A, viewed as relative fractal
drum (A, Ω), with Ω being the countable disjoint union of open triangles
contained in the unit triangle Ω0. Right: An equivalent interpretation of
the Sierpi´nski gasket drum (A, Ω). Here, Ω is a coutable disjoint union
of open equilateral triangles, and A = ∂Ω. (There are 3j triangles with
sides 2−j−1 in the union, j ∈ N0.) Both pictures depict the ﬁrst three
iterations of the construction. We can also view the standard Sierpi´nski
gasket A as a relative fractal drum (A, Ω), in which Ω is just the open
unit triangle on the left picture.

(∂Ω0, Ω0) as the basic relative fractal drum, where Ω0 is an open equilateral triangle
of sides of length 1/2, λ = 1/2 and b = 3. (See the left part of Figure 1.) Its relative
box dimension exists and is equal to D = log2 3.

(c) If Ω0 is any bounded open set in R2 (say, an open disk), λ = 1/2 and b = 3,
we obtain a fractal spray (A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, 1/2, 3), in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.1.
In Theorem 4.6, we shall see that if Ω0 has a Lipschitz boundary, then the set of
poles of the relative zeta function of this fractal spray (which is a relative fractal
drum), as well as the multiplicities of the poles, do not depend on the choice of
Ω0.
In particular, the box
dimension of the generalized Sierpi´nski relative fractal drum is constant, and equal
to D = log2 3.

In this sense, examples (b) and (c) are equivalent.

In other words, the Sierpi´nski gasket (A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, 1/2, 3), appearing in
Example 4.5(b), can be viewed as any countable disjoint collection of open triangles
in the plane (which can even be an unbounded collection) and their bounding
triangles, of sizes λj = 2−j−1 and multiplicities bj = 3j, j ∈ N0, and not just as the
standard disjoint collection of open triangles, densely packed inside the unit open
triangle; see the right part of Figure 1.

By using the scaling property stated in Theorem 2.16, it is easy to explicitly
compute the distance zeta function of relative fractal sprays. Note that the zeta
j . Theorem 4.6 just below

function involves the Dirichlet series f (s) = P∞j=0 bjλs

can be considered as an extension of Theorem 2.16.

Theorem 4.6 (Distance zeta function of relative fractal sprays). Let

(A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, (λj)j≥0, (bj)j≥0)

be a relative fractal spray in RN , in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.1, and such that
|Ω0| < ∞. Assume that condition (4.1.7) of Lemma 4.4 is satisﬁed; that is, |Ω| <
∞. Let Ω be the (countable, disjoint) union of all the open sets appearing in the

4.1. RELATIVE FRACTAL SPRAYS IN RN

59

skeleton, corresponding to the fractal spray. (In other words, Ω is the disjoint union
of the open sets Ωj, each repeated with the multiplicity bj for j ∈ N0.) Let f (s) :=
j . (Note that according to (4.1.7), this Dirichlet series converges absolutely
for Re s ≥ N ; i.e., D(f ) ≤ N .) Then, for Re s > max{dimB(A, Ω), D(f )}, the
distance zeta function of the relative fractal spray (A, Ω) is given by

P∞j=0 bjλs

(4.1.9)

and

(4.1.10)

ζA,Ω(s) = f (s) · ζ∂Ω0,Ω0(s),

dimB(A, Ω) = max{dimB(∂Ω0, Ω0), D(f )}.

Proof. Clearly, it follows from (4.1.7) that f (N ) < ∞. Hence, D(f ) ≤ N ; so
that dimB(A, Ω) ≤ N . Each open set of the skeleton of the relative fractal spray is
obtained by a rigid motion of sets of the form λj Ω0, and for any ﬁxed j, there are
precisely bj such sets. Identity (4.1.9) then follows immediately from Theorems 2.16
and 2.19. The remaining claims are easily derived using this identity.
(cid:3)

It follows from Deﬁnition 4.2 and relation (4.1.9) that the distance zeta function
of the tensor product is equal to the product of the zeta functions of its components:

(4.1.11)

ζ(∂Ω0,Ω0)⊗L(s) = ζL(s) · ζ∂Ω0,Ω0(s).

Equation (4.1.10) can therefore be written as follows:

(4.1.12)

dimB((∂Ω0, Ω0) ⊗ L) = max{dim(∂Ω0, Ω0), dimBL}.

Definition 4.7. The Dirichlet series f (s) := P∞j=1 bjλs

j (or, more generally,
its meromorphic extension to a connected open subset U of C, when it exists), is
called the scaling zeta function of the relative fractal spray (A, Ω) and is denoted
by ζS(s); hence, the factorization formula (4.1.9) can also be rewritten as follows:

(4.1.13)

ζA,Ω(s) = ζS(s) · ζ∂Ω0,Ω0 (s).

Theorem 4.8. Assume that a relative fractal spray (A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, λ, b),
as introduced at the end of Deﬁnition 4.1, is such that |Ω0| < ∞, λ ∈ (0, 1), b ≥ 2
is an integer, and bλN < 1. Then, for Re s > max{dimB(∂Ω0, Ω0), log1/λ b}), we
have

(4.1.14)

ζA,Ω(s) =

ζ∂Ω0,Ω0 (s)
1 − bλs

,

and the lower bound for Re s is optimal. In particular, it is equal to D(ζA,Ω), and
hence,

dimB(A, Ω) = D(ζA,Ω) = max{dimB(∂Ω0, Ω0), log1/λ b}.

If, in addition, Ω0 is bounded and has a Lipschitz boundary such that ∂Ω0 can

be described by ﬁnitely many Lipschitz charts, then

dimB(A, Ω) = max{N − 1, log1/λ b}.

(4.1.15)
Therefore, if we assume that log1/λ b ∈ (N − 1, N ), then the set dimP C (A, Ω) =
Pc(ζA,Ω) of principal complex dimensions of the relative fractal spray (A, Ω) is given
by

(4.1.16)

dimP C (A, Ω) = log1/λ b +

2π

log(1/λ) iZ.

Proof. If λj := λ and bj := bj for all j ∈ N0, with bλN < 1, thenP∞j=0 bjλjN =

1−bλN < ∞; so that |Ω| < ∞, as desired. Identity (4.1.14) follows immediately from
(4.1.9), using the fact that for Ω0 with a Lipschitz boundary satisfying the stated
assumption, we have dimB(∂Ω0, Ω0) = dimB∂Ω0 = N − 1 (this follows, for exam-
ple, from [ˇZuˇZup, Lemma 3]), together with the property of ﬁnite stability of the
upper box dimension; see, e.g., [Fal1, p. 44].
(cid:3)

Example 4.9. Here, we construct a relative fractal spray

(A, Ω) = Spray(Ω0, (λj )j≥1, (bj)≥1)

in R2 such that |Ω0| < ∞, bj ≡ 1,P∞j=1 λ2

j < ∞ (hence, |Ω| < ∞ by Lemma 4.4),
and such that the base set Ω0 is unbounded, as well as its boundary ∂Ω0. Let Ω0
be any unbounded Borel set of ﬁnite 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure, such that
both Ω0 and ∂Ω0 are unbounded, and Ω0 is contained in the horizontal strip

We can explicitly construct such a set as follows:

V1 := {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < 1}.

Ω0 := {(x, y) ∈ R2 : 0 < y < x−α, x > 1},

where α > 1, so that |Ω0| < ∞.
Furthermore, let (Vj)j≥1 be a countable, disjoint sequence of horizontal strips
in the plane, deﬁned for each j ∈ N by Vj = V1 +(0, j), the Minkowski sum of Vj and
j < ∞.
It is clear that for any λj , j ≥ 2, the set λj Ω0 is congruent (up to a rigid motion)
to the subset Ωj := λj Ω0 + (0, j) of Vj. Then, the fractal spray

(0, j). Let (λj)j≥1 be a sequence of real numbers in (0, 1) such thatP∞j=1 λ2

(A, Ω) =

(∂Ωj, Ωj)

∞[j=1

has the desired properties.

4.2. Relative Sierpi´nski sprays and their complex dimensions

We provide two examples of relative fractal sprays, dealing with the relative
Sierpi´nski gasket and the relative Sierpi´nski carpet, respectively. In the sequel, it
will be useful to introduce the following deﬁnition.

Definition 4.10. We say that two given relative fractal drums (A1, Ω1) and
(A2, Ω2) in RN are congruent if there exists an isometry f : RN → RN such that
A2 = f (A1) and Ω2 = f (Ω1).

It is easy to see that the congruence of RFDs is an equivalence relation.
The following lemma states, in particular, that any two congruent RFDs have
equal distance zeta functions. We leave its proof as a simple excercise for the
interested reader.

Lemma 4.11. Let (A1, Ω1) and (A2, Ω2) be two congruent RFDs in RN . Then,

for any r ∈ R, we have
(4.2.1)

Mr

∗(A1, Ω1) = Mr

∗(A2, Ω2), M∗r(A1, Ω1) = M∗r(A2, Ω2)

and

(4.2.2)

dimB(A1, Ω1) = dimB(A2, Ω2),

dimB(A1, Ω1) = dimB(A2, Ω2).

Figure 2. On the left is depicted the base relative fractal drum
(∂Ω0, Ω0) of the relative Sierpi´nski gasket, where Ω0 is the associated
(open) equilateral triangle with sides 1/2. It can be viewed as the (dis-
joint) union of six RFDs, all of which are congruent to the relative
fractal drum (A′, Ω′) on the right. This ﬁgure explains Equation (4.2.4)
appearing in Example 4.12; see Lemma 4.11.

Furthermore,

(4.2.3)

ζA1,Ω1(s) = ζA2,Ω2 (s)

for any s ∈ C with Re s > dimB(A1, Ω1).

It follows from (4.2.3) that under the hypotheses of Lemma 4.11 and given a
connected open set U ⊆ C, ζA1,Ω1 and ζA2,Ω2 have the exact same mermomorphic
continuation to U , and therefore the same poles in U and associated residues (or
more generally, principal parts in the case of multiple poles). In particular, two
congruent RFDs have the same (visible) complex dimensions.

Example 4.12. (Relative Sierpi´nski gasket). Let A be the Sierpi´nski gasket in
R2, the outer boundary of which is an equilateral triangle with unit sides. Consider
the countable family of all open triangles in the standard construction of the gas-
ket. (Namely, these are the open triangles which are deleted at each stage of the
construction.) If Ω is the largest open triangle (with unit sides), then the relative
Sierpi´nski gasket is deﬁned as the ordered pair (A, Ω). The distance zeta function
ζA,Ω of the relative Sierpi´nski gasket (A, Ω) can be computed as the distance zeta
function of the following relative fractal spray (see Deﬁnition 4.1):

Spray(Ω0, λ = 1/2, b = 3),

where Ω0 is the ﬁrst deleted open triangle with sides 1/2. It suﬃces to apply Equa-
tion (4.1.14) from Theorem 4.8. Decomposing Ω0 into the union of six congruent
right triangles (determined by the heights of the triangle Ω0, see Figure 2) with

ζA,Ω(s) =

6(√3)1−s2−s

where the equality holds for all s ∈ C with Re s > log2 3 and the equivalence ∼ holds
in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.7. Therefore, by the principle of analytic continuation,
it follows that ζA,Ω has a meromorphic extension to the entire complex plane, given
by the same closed form as in Equation (4.2.5). More speciﬁcally,

(4.2.6)

ζA,Ω(s) =

6(√3)1−s2−s

s(s − 1)(1 − 3 · 2−s)

for all

Hence, the set of all of the complex dimensions (in C) of the relative Sierpi´nski
gasket is given by

(4.2.7)

P(ζA,Ω) =(cid:16) log2 3 +

2π

log 2 iZ(cid:17) ∪ {0, 1}.

Each of these complex dimensions in (4.2.7) is simple (i.e., is a simple pole of ζA,Ω).
Note that here, {0, 1} can be interpreted as the set of integer dimensions of A, in
the sense of [LapPe2–3] and [LapPeWi1]. In particular, we deduce from (4.2.7)
that D(ζA,Ω) = log2 3, and we thus recover a well-known result. Namely, the set
dimP C (A, Ω) := Pc(ζA,Ω) of principal complex dimensions of the relative Sierpi´nski
gasket (A, Ω) is given by

(4.2.8)

dimP C (A, Ω) = log2 3 + piZ,

where p = 2π/log 2 is the oscillatory period of the Sierpi´nski gasket; see [Lap-vFr3,
§6.6.1].

Note, however, that in [Lap-vFr1–3], the complex dimensions are obtained in
a completely diﬀerent manner (via an associated spectral zeta function) and not
geometrically. In addition, all of the complex dimensions of the Sierpi´nski gasket A
are shown to be principal (that is, to be located on the vertical line Re s = log2 3 =
dimB A), a conclusion which is slightly diﬀerent from (4.2.7) above.1 We also refer
to [ChrIvLap] and [LapSar], as well as to [LapPe2–3] and [LapPeWi1–2], for
diﬀerent approaches (via a spectral zeta function associated to a suitable geometric
Dirac operator and via a self-similar tiling associated with A, respectively) leading
to the same conclusion.

In light of (4.2.6), the residue of the distance zeta function ζA,Ω of the relative
Sierpi´nski gasket computed at any principal pole sk := log2 3 + pki, k ∈ Z, is given
1Analogously, for a fractal string RFD (A, Ω), we have P(ζA,Ω) = P(ζL) ∪ {0}; here, of

course, N = 1 instead of N = 2.

The following proposition shows that the relative Sierpi´nski gasket can be
viewed as the relative fractal spray generated by the relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′)
appearing on the right-hand side of Figure 2.

Proposition 4.13 (Relative Sierpi´nski gasket). Let (A′, Ω′) be the relative
fractal drum deﬁned on the right part of Figure 2. Let (A, Ω) be the relative fractal
spray generated by the base relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′), with scaling ratio λ = 1/2
and with multiplicities mk = 6 · 3k−1, for any positive integer k:
(4.2.9)
(Note that we assume here that the base relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′) has a multi-
plicity equal to 8.) Then, the relative distance zeta function of the relative fractal
spray (A, Ω) is equal to the relative distance zeta function of the relative Sierpi´nski
gasket; see Equation (4.2.6).

(A, Ω) = Spray((A′, Ω′), λ = 1/2, mk = 6 · 3k−1 for k ∈ N).

Example 4.14. (Inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFD). The usual Sierpi´nski

gasket is contained in the unit triangle in the plane. Its analog in R3, which we call
the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski 3-gasket or inhomogeneous tetrahedral gasket, and
denote by A3, is obtained by deleting the middle open octahedron (from the initial
compact, convex unit tetrahedron), deﬁned as the interior of the convex hull of
the midpoints of each of the six edges of the initial tetrahedron (thus, four sub-
tetrahedrons are left after the ﬁrst step), and so on. Such sets, along with their
higher-dimensional counterparts, are discussed, for example, in [KiLap].

More generally, for any integer N ≥ 2, the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket
AN , contained in RN , can be deﬁned as follows. Let VN := {P1, P2, . . . , PN +1} be
a set of N points in RN such that the mutual distance of any two points from the
set is equal to 1.

The set VN , where N ≥ 2, with the indicated property, can be constructed
inductively as follows. For N = 2, we take V2 to be the set of vertices of any unit
triangle in R2. We then reason by induction. Given N ≥ 2, we assume that the set
VN of N +1 points in RN has been constructed. Note that the set VN is contained in
a sphere, whose center is denoted by O. Let us consider the line of RN +1 = RN × R
through the point O and perpendicular to the hyperplane RN = RN ×{0} in RN +1.
There exists a unique point PN +2 in the half-plane {xN +1 > 0} of RN +1, which
is a unit distance from all of the N vertices of VN . (Here, we identify VN with
VN × {0} ⊂ RN +1.) We then deﬁne VN +1 by VN +1 := VN ∪ {PN +2}.
Let us deﬁne ΩN as the convex hull of the set VN . As usual, we call it the
N -simplex. Let ΩN,0, called the N -plex, be the open set deﬁned as the interior

of the convex hull of the set of midpoints of all of the (cid:0)N +1

simplex ΩN .
[For example, for N = 2, the set Ω2,0 (that is, the 2-plex) is an
open equilateral triangle in R2 of side lengths equal to 1/2, while for N = 3, the

2 (cid:1) edges of the N -

or the Sierpi´nski 3-gasket RFD. The complement of the union of all
open octahedra, with respect to the initial tetrahedron Ω3, is called the
inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski 3-gasket.

j=1Φj (S), where {Φj}4

Unlike the classic Sierpi´nski 3-gasket (also known as the Sierpi´nski
pyramid or tetrahedron) S3, which is a (homogeneous or standard)
self-similar set in R3 and satisﬁes the usual ﬁxed point equation,
S = ∪4
j=1 are suitable contractive similitudes of
R3 with respective ﬁxed points {Pj}4
j=1 of
common value 1/2, the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski 3-gasket A3 is not a
self-similar set. Instead, it is an inhomogeneous self-similar set (in the
sense of [BarDem], see also Equation (4.2.37) below and the discussion
surrounding it). More speciﬁcally, A := A3 satisﬁes the following in-
homogeneous ﬁxed point equation (of which it is the unique solution in
the class of all nonempty compact subsets of R3), A = S4
j=1 Φj (A) ∪ B,
where B is the boundary of the ﬁrst octahedron Ω3,0 (in fact, B can
simply be taken as the union of four middle triangles on the boundary
of the outer tetrahedron Ω3).

j=1 and scaling ratios {rj}4

set Ω3,0 (that is, the 3-plex) is an open octahedron in R3 of side lengths equal to
1/2.] The set ΩN \ ΩN,0 is equal to the union of N + 1 congruent N -simplices with
disjoint interiors, having all of their sides equal to 1/2. This is the ﬁrst step of the
construction. We proceed analogously with each of the N + 1 compact N -simplices.
The compact set AN obtained in this way is called the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -
gasket. It can be identiﬁed with the relative fractal spray (AN , ΩN ) in RN , called
the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFD (and, in short, the inhomogeneous
N -gasket RFD), deﬁned by

(4.2.10)

(AN , ΩN ) = Spray ((∂ΩN,0, ΩN,0), λ = 1/2, b = N + 1).

(See the end of Deﬁnition 4.1.) According to Theorem 4.8, we have

(4.2.11)
where the scaling zeta function ζS(s) of the N -gasket RFD is given for all s ∈ C
such that Re s > log2(N + 1) by

ζAN ,ΩN (s) = ζS(s) · ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0(s),

ζS(s) =

Upon analytic continuation, it follows that ζS can be meromorphically continued
to the whole of C and is given by

(4.2.13)

ζS(s) =

1 − (N + 1)2−s ,

for all s ∈ C.

Since (by (4.2.13)) the set of poles of ζS is given by

and the set of poles of the distance zeta function of the relative N -plex (∂ΩN,0, ΩN,0)
is given by

(4.2.15)
and (ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0) 6= 0 for all s ∈ C \ P(ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0), we conclude that the set of
poles (complex dimensions) of the relative Sierpi´nski N -gasket (AN , ΩN ) is given
by

P(ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0) = {0, 1, . . . , N − 1},

which extends the well-known results for N = 2 and 3, corresponding to the usual
Sierpi´nski gasket in R2 and the tetrahedral gasket in R3, respectively. (Namely,
their respective relative box dimensions are equal to log2 3 and 2).

It can be shown that in this case, dimB(AN , ΩN ) and dimB AN exist and

dimB(AN , ΩN ) = dimB AN = dimH AN ,

(4.2.19)
as given by the right-hand side of (4.2.18), where (as before) dimH (· ) denotes
the Hausdorﬀ dimension. Furthermore, it is easy to see that dimP C (AN , ΩN ) =
dimP C AN .

The relative distance zeta function ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0 of the N -plex RFD can be ex-
plicitly computed as follows, in the case when N = 3. It is easy to see that the
octahedral RFD (∂Ω3,0, Ω3,0) can be identiﬁed with sixteen copies of disjoint RFDs,
each of which is congruent to the pyramidal RFD (T, Ω′) in R3, where Ω′ is the

s(s − 1)(s − 2)(1 − 4 · 2−s)

It is worth noting that s = 2 is the only pole of order 2, since s = 2 is the simple
pole of both (s − 2)−1 and (1 − 4 · 2−s)−1. More speciﬁcally, since the derivative
of 1 − 4 · 2−s computed at s = 2 is nonzero (and, in fact, is equal to 4 log 2), then
s = 2 is a simple zero of 1 − 4 · 2−s; that is, it is a simple pole of 1/(1 − 4 · 2−s).

Moreover, it immediately follows from Equation (4.2.23) that

(4.2.24)

ζA3,Ω3(s) ∼

1

(s − 2)(1 − 4 · 2−s)

.

In particular, as we have already seen in Equation (4.2.17), we have

(4.2.25)

dimP C (A3, Ω3) = 2 +

2π
log 2 iZ.

Since D = 2 is a simple pole of both 1/(s − 2) and 1/(1 − 4 · 2−s), we conclude
that D = 2 is the only complex dimension of order two of the RFD (A3, Ω3).
Consequently, the case of the relative Sierpi´nski 3-gasket (A3, Ω3) reveals a new
phenomenon: its relative box dimension D = 2 is a complex dimension of order (i.e.,
multiplicity) two, while all the other complex dimensions of the relative Sierpi´nski 3-
gasket (including the double sequence of nonreal complex dimensions on the critical
line of convergence {Re s = 2}) are simple.

4.2. RELATIVE SIERPI ´NSKI SPRAYS AND THEIR COMPLEX DIMENSIONS

67

By using arguments similar to those used when N = 3, one can show that for
any N ≥ 3, the distance zeta function of the relative N -plex (∂ΩN,0, ΩN,0) is of the
form

(4.2.26)

ζ∂ΩN,0,ΩN,0(s) =

g(s)

s(s − 1) . . . (s − (N − 1))

,

where g(s) is a nonvanishing entire function. In the special case when N = 3, this
is in accordance with Equation (4.2.22) above. Therefore, from Equations (4.2.11)
and (4.2.13) above, we conclude that

(4.2.27)

ζAN ,ΩN (s) =

g(s)

s(s − 1) . . . (s − (N − 1))(1 − (N + 1)2−s)

.

This extends Equation (4.2.23) to any N ≥ 3.
In the case when N ≥ 4, D = N − 1 is the only principal complex dimension
of the relative Sierpi´nski N -gasket. (Indeed, for N ≥ 4 we have that log2(N +
1) < N − 1 (i.e., N + 1 < 2N−1), which can be easily proved, for example, by
using mathematical induction.) Also, all the other complex dimensions are simple.
Furthermore, we immediately deduce from Equation (4.2.27) that

(4.2.28)

ζAN ,ΩN (s) ∼

1

s − (N − 1)

.

Moreover, if N ≥ 4 is of the form N = 2k − 1 for some integer k ≥ 3, then
s = k (note that it is smaller than D = N − 1) is the only complex dimension of
order two (since it is a simple pole of both (s− k)−1 and (1− (N + 1)2−s)−1), while
all the other complex dimensions are simple.
On the other hand, if N ≥ 4 is not of the form N = 2k − 1 for any integer
k ≥ 3, then all of the complex dimensions of the relative Sierpi´nski N -gasket are
simple.
Roughly speaking, in the case when N = 3, the fact that s = 2 has multiplicity
two can be explained geometrically as follows: ﬁrstly, s = 2 is a simple pole arising
from the self-similarity of the RFD (A3, Ω3),3 while at the same time, s = 2 is
a simple pole arising from the geometry of the boundary of the ﬁrst (deleted)
octahedron, which is also 2-dimensional.

In the case of the ordinary Sierpi´nski gasket, i.e, of the relative Sierpi´nski
2-gasket, the value of s = log2 3 (which is the simple pole arising from the self-
similarity of (A2, Ω2)) is strictly larger than the dimension s = 1 of the boundary
of the deleted triangle (i.e., of the 2-plex Ω2,0). Moreover, the relative Sierpi´nski
2-gasket is Minkowski nondegenerate and Minkowski nonmeasurable, while the rela-
tive Sierpi´nski 3-gasket is Minkowski degenerate, with its 2-dimensional Minkowski
content being equal to +∞.
On the other hand, when N ≥ 4, the dimension N − 1 of the boundary of
the N -plex ΩN,0 is larger than the similarity dimension log2(N + 1) arising from
fractality. Since D = log2(N + 1) is the only complex dimension on the critical line
(and it is simple), we conclude that for N ≥ 4, the RFD (AN , ΩN ) is Minkowski
measurable (see [LapRaˇZu5]). Thus, the case when N = 3 is indeed very special
among all relative Sierpi´nski N -gaskets.

3Indeed, the similarity dimension of the 3-gasket A3 is equal to 2.

68

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

We refer the interested reader to [LapRaˇZu5] and [LapRaˇZu8] (as well as to
the relevant part of [LapRaˇZu1, §5.5]) for a detailed discussion of the property of
Minkowski measurability (or of Minkowski nonmeasurability) of the N -gasket RFD
(AN , ΩN ), for any N ≥ 2 and for the corresponding fractal tube formulas. Let us
simply mention here that for N = 3, a suitable gauge function can be found with
respect to which A3 is not only Minkowski nondegenerate but is also Minkowki
measurable. (Note that for N 6= 3, AN is Minkowski nondegenerate in the usual
sense, that is, relative to the trivial gauge function.)

Let σ0 be the common similarity dimension of the inhomogneous Sierpi´nski N -
gasket AN , the relative Sierpi´nski N -gasket (AN , ΩN ) (where the latter is viewed
as a self-similar fractal spray or RFD) and the classic Sierpi´nski N -gasket SN
(to be discussed below). Since the corresponding scaling ratios {rj}N +1
satisfy
r1 = ··· = rN +1 = 1/2, the similarity dimension σ0, deﬁned as being the unique
real solution s of the Moran equationPN +1
j = 1 (i.e., here, 2s = N + 1, s ∈ R),
is given by

j=1 rs

j=1

(4.2.29)

σ0 = log2(N + 1).

In light of Equation (4.1.10) and since dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0) = N − 1 (by Equation
(4.2.15)), we see that dimB(AN , ΩN ) = σ0 for N = 2 or N = 3, that

(4.2.30)

for N = 2,

σ0 = dimB(AN , ΩN ) > dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0)

(4.2.31)

σ0 = dimB(AN , ΩN ) = dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0) (= 2)

for N = 3, whereas for every N ≥ 4, we have that
(4.2.32)

σ0 = log2(N + 1) < dimB(AN , ΩN ) = dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0) = N − 1.

(Recall from (4.2.19) that dimB AN = dimB(AN , ΩN ).) On the other hand, if SN
denotes the classic Sierpi´nski N -gasket in RN (to be further discussed below), then
for every N ≥ 2, we have that
(4.2.33)

dimB SN (= dimH SN ) = σ0 = log2(N + 1).

The latter statement follows from a classic result of Hutchinson in [Hut] for self-
similar sets satisfying the open set condition (which is the case of SN for every
N ≥ 2) and extending to higher dimensions the basic result of Moran [Mora] for
one-dimensional self-similar sets.4 (See [Fal1, Theorem 9.3] for the statement and
a detailed proof of this theorem.)

We close this discussion of the N -gasket RFD (AN , ΩN ) by explaining the dis-
crepancy between the results obtained in (4.2.30), (4.2.31) and, especially, (4.2.32)
for the self-similar spray (AN , ΩN ) and the usual result (4.2.33) for the self-similar
set SN , the classic Sierpi´nski N -gasket.

4Note that S1 ⊂ R is just the unit interval, viewed as a self-similar set with scaling ratios
r1 = r2 = 1/2. However, in the present discussion, we consider the more interesting case when
N ≥ 2.

4.2. RELATIVE SIERPI ´NSKI SPRAYS AND THEIR COMPLEX DIMENSIONS

69

First of all, note that in light of (4.2.11) and (4.2.13) (see also Theorem 4.6),

we must have

(4.2.34)

dimB(AN , ΩN ) (= dimBAN )

= max{σ0, dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0)}
= max{log2(N + 1), N − 1},

and that, in the present case, the upper Minkowski dimensions can be replaced by
the Minkowski dimensions in Equation (4.2.34).

Indeed, by (4.2.11), we have

(4.2.35)

D(ζAN ,ΩN ) = max{D(ζS), D(ζAN,0,ΩN,)}

and by part (b) of Theorem 2.1, we have

D(ζAN ,ΩN ) = dimBD(AN , ΩN )

and

from which (4.2.34) follows since σ0 = log2(N + 1). (See Theorem 4.6.)

D(ζAN,0,ΩN,0) = dimBD(AN,0, ΩN,0),

Identity (4.2.34) explains why (4.2.30), (4.2.31) and (4.2.32) hold.

Indeed,
if we let DG := dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0) (the Minkowski dimension of the base RFD
(AN,0, ΩN,0) generating the self-similar RFD (AN , ΩN )) and D := dimB(AN , ΩN ),
we deduce from (4.2.34) and an elementary computation that D = σ0 if N = 2,
D = σ0 = DG if N = 3, whereas D = DG if N ≥ 4, in agreement with (4.2.30),
(4.2.31) and (4.2.32), respectively.
From the geometric point of view, the diﬀerence between AN and SN can
be explained as follows. As is well known (see, e.g., [KiLap] and the relevant
references therein), the (homogeneous) Sierpi´nski N -gasket SN is a self-similar set
(satisfying the open set condition), associated with the iterated function system
(IFS) {Φj}N +1
j=1 , where (for j = 1, . . . , N + 1) each Φj is a contractive similitude of
RN with ﬁxed point Pj and scaling ratio rj = 1/2; i.e., the associated scaling ratio
list {rj}N +1
is given by r1 = ··· = rN +1 = 1/2. More speciﬁcally,
SN is the unique (nonempty) compact subset K of RN which is the solution of the
(homogeneous) ﬁxed point equation

j=1 of {Φj}N +1

j=1

(4.2.36)

K = Φ(K) :=

Φj(K).

N +1[j=1

On the other hand, unless N = 2, the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket
AN is not a self-similar set in the classic sense of [Hut] (see also [Fal1, Chapter
9]).
(For N = 2, A2 coincides with the usual Sierpi´nski gasket S2.) However,
interestingly, it is an inhomogeneous self-similar set, in the sense of Barnsley and
Demko [BarDem] (see also [BarDem, Fra] and the relevant reference therein for
further results about such sets). More speciﬁcally, AN is the unique (nonempty)
solution K of the inhomogeneous ﬁxed point equation

(4.2.37)

K = Φ(K) ∪ B,

where Φ is deﬁned as above and B is a suitable compact subset of RN . For N = 2,
the set A2 = S2 is both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, since it satisﬁes Equation
(4.2.37) both for B = ∅ and B = ∂A2,0 (the boundary of the unit triangle). By

Ω0 is the associated (open) square with sides 1/3. The base relative
fractal drum (∂Ω0, Ω0) can be viewed as the (disjoint) union of eight
RFDs, all of which are congruent to the relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′)
on the right. This ﬁgure explains Equation (4.2.39); see Lemma 4.11.

contrast, when N ≥ 3, the compact set B is nonempty and hence, AN is not self-
similar for this IFS {Φj}N +1
j=1 , For N = 3, a description of several possible choices
for B can be found in the caption of Figure 3. When N ≥ 3, let us simply state
that we can choose B to be the boundary of ΩN,0: B = ∂ΩN,0. (Other choices are
possible, however.)

Example 4.15. (Relative Sierpi´nski carpet). Let A be the Sierpi´nski carpet
contained in the unit square Ω. Let (A, Ω) be the corresponding relative Serpi´nski
carpet, with Ω being the unit square. Its distance zeta function ζA,Ω coincides with
the distance zeta function of the following relative fractal spray (see Deﬁnition 4.1):

Spray(Ω0, λ = 1/3, b = 8),

where Ω0 is the ﬁrst deleted open square with sides 1/3. Similarly as in Example
4.12, using Theorem 4.8 and Lemma 4.11, we obtain that ζA,Ω, the relative distance
zeta functions of (A, Ω), has a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex
plane given for all s ∈ C by

(4.2.38)

ζA,Ω(s) =

8 · 6−s

s(s − 1)(1 − 8 · 3−s)

.

Indeed, clearly, the base relative fractal drum (∂Ω0, Ω0) is the (disjoint) union
of eight relative fractal drums, each of which is congruent to a relative fractal drum
(A′, Ω′), where Ω′ is an appropriate isosceles right triangle; see Figure 4. We then

1 − 8 · 3−s ,

one deduces from this equivalence that the abscissa of convergence of ζA,Ω is given
by D = log3 8 = dimB(A, Ω), where the equality follows from Theorem 2.1(b).

Here, the relative box dimension of A coincides with its usual box dimension,
namely, log3 8. Moreover, the set Pc(ζA,Ω) of relative principal complex dimensions
of the Sierpi´nski carpet A with respect to the unit square Ω is given by

(4.2.41)

dimP C (A, Ω) = log3 8 + piZ,

where p := 2π/ log 3 is the oscillatory period of the Sierpi´nski carpet A.

Observe that it follows immediately from (4.2.38) that the set P(ζA,Ω) of all
relative complex dimensions of the Sierpi´nski carpet A (with respect to the unit
square Ω) is given by

P(ζA,Ω) = dimP C A ∪ {0, 1} = (log3 8 + piZ) ∪ {0, 1},

where {0, 1} can be viewed as the set of ‘integer dimensions’ of A (in the sense of
[LapPe2–3] and [LapPeWi1], see also [Lap-vFr3, §13.1]). Furthermore, each of
these relative complex dimensions is simple (i.e., is a simple pole of ζA,Ω). Interest-
ingly, these are exactly the complex dimensions which one would expect to be associ-
ated with A, according to the theory developed in [LapPe2–3] and [LapPeWi1–2]
(as described in [Lap-vFr3, §13.1]) via self-similar tilings (or sprays) and associated
tubular zeta functions.
In light of (4.2.38), the residue of the distance zeta function of the relative
Sierpi´nski carpet (A, Ω) computed at any principal pole sk := log3 8 + pik, k ∈ Z
is given by

Similarly as in the case of the relative Sierpi´nski gasket (see Proposition 4.13),
the relative Sierpi´nski carpet can be viewed as a fractal spray generated by the base
RFD appearing in Figure 4 on the right.

72

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

Proposition 4.16 (Relative Sierpi´nski carpet). Let (A′, Ω′) be the RFD
deﬁned on the right-hand side of Figure 4. Let (A, Ω) be the relative fractal spray
generated by the base relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′), with scaling ratio λ = 1/3 and
with multiplicities mk = 8k for any positive integer k:

(A, Ω) = Spray((A′, Ω′), λ = 1/3, mk = 8k for k ∈ N).

(4.2.42)
(Note that we assume here that the base relative fractal drum (A′, Ω′) has a multi-
plicity equal to 8.) Then, the relative distance zeta function of the relative fractal
spray (A, Ω) is equal to the relative distance zeta function of the relative Sierpi´nski
carpet. (See Equation (4.2.38).)

Example 4.17. (Sierpi´nski N -carpet).

It is easy to generalize the example
of the standard Sierpi´nski carpet (which is a compact subset of the unit square
[0, 1]2 ⊂ R2, see Example 4.15 above), to the Sierpi´nski N -carpet (or N -carpet, for
short), deﬁned analogously as a compact subset A of the unit N -dimensional cube
[0, 1]N ⊂ RN . More precisely, we divide [0, 1]N into the union of 3N congruent
N -dimensional subcubes of length 1/3 and with disjoint interiors and then remove
the middle open subcube. The remaining compact set is denoted by F1. We then
remove the middle open N -dimensional cubes of length 1/32 from the remaining
3N − 1 subcubes. The resulting compact subset is denoted by F2. Proceeding
analogously ad inﬁnitum, we obtain a decreasing sequence of compact subsets Fk
of [0, 1]N , for k ≥ 1. The Sierpi´nski N -carpet A is then deﬁned by
(4.2.43)

A :=

Fk.

∞\k=1

(Note that the Sierpi´nski 1-carpet coincides with the usual ternary Cantor set,
while the Sierpi´nski 2-carpet coincides with the usual Sierpi´nski carpet discussed
in Example 4.15; furthermore, the Sierpi´nski 3-carpet is discussed in [LapRaˇZu6,
Example 2].)

It is clear that the Sierpi´nski N -carpet RFD (A, Ω), where A is the Sierpi´nski
N -carpet and Ω := (0, 1)N is the open unit cube, can be viewed as the following
relative fractal spray; see the end of Deﬁnition 4.1:

(A, Ω) = Spray ((∂Ω0, Ω0), λ = 1/3, b = 3N − 1).

(4.2.44)
(Here, the cube Ω0 = (0, 1/3)N is obtained by a suitable translation of the middle
open subcube from the ﬁrst step of the construction of the set A.) According to
Theorem 4.8, we then have that

(4.2.45)

ζA,Ω(s) = f (s) · ζ∂Ω0,Ω0 (s)

=

ζ∂Ω0,Ω0 (s)

1 − (3N − 1)3−s ∼

1

1 − (3N − 1)3−s .

Since Ω0 has a Lipschitz boundary and log1/λ b = log3(3N − 1) ∈ (N − 1, N ), we
deduce from (4.1.16) in Theorem 4.8 that the set of principal complex dimensions
of the relative Sierpi´nski N -carpet spray is given by

(4.2.46)

and hence,

dimP C (A, Ω) = log3(3N − 1) +

2π
log 3 iZ

dimP C (A, Ω) ⊂ {Re s = log3(3N − 1)} ⊂ {N − 1 < Re s < N}.

4.3. SELF-SIMILAR SPRAYS AND RFDS

73

In particular, according to Theorem 2.1(b), we have that
dimB(A, Ω) = log3(3N − 1).

(4.2.47)

Furthermore, it can be shown that in the present case of the Sierpi´nski N -carpet
RFD, we have that dimB A and dimB(A, Ω) exist and

(4.2.48)

dimB(A, Ω) = dimB(A, Ω) = dimB A = log3(3N − 1).

It is easy to see that the set of principal complex dimensions dimP C A of the
Sierpi´nski N -carpet A in RN coincides with the set dimP C (A, Ω) appearing in
Equation (4.2.46). As simple special cases, we obtain the set of principal complex
dimensions of the ternary Cantor set or of the usual Sierpi´nski carpet appearing in
Equation (4.2.41), for N = 1 or N = 2, respectively.

Since the set of all complex dimensions of the RFD (∂Ω0, Ω0) is equal to
{0, 1, . . . , N − 1},5 it follows from Equation (4.2.45) that the set of all complex
dimensions of the Sierpi´nski N -carpet relative fractal spray (A, Ω) is given by

(4.2.49)

P(ζA,Ω) = dimP C (A, Ω) ∪ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}

=(cid:16) log3(3N − 1) +

2π

log 3 iZ(cid:17) ∪ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}.

This concludes our study of the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) naturally associated

with the N -dimensional Sierpi´nski carpet.

4.3. Self-similar sprays and RFDs

Let us now recall the deﬁnition of a self-similar spray or tiling (see [LapPe2–
3], [LapPeWi1–2], [Lap-vFr3, §13.1]). More precisely, let us state this deﬁnition
slightly more generally and in the context of relative fractal drums.

Definition 4.18. (Self-similar spray or tiling). Let G be a given open subset
(base set or generator) of RN of ﬁnite N -dimensional Lebesgue measure and let
{r1, r2, . . . , rJ} be a ﬁnite multiset (also called a ratio list) of positive real numbers
such that J ∈ N, J ≥ 2 and

(4.3.1)

rN
j < 1.

JXj=1

Furthermore, let Λ be the multiset consisting of all the possible ‘words’ of multiples
of the scaling factors r1, . . . , rJ ; that is, let

(4.3.2)

Λ := {1, r1, . . . , rJ , r1r1, . . . , r1rJ , r2r1, . . . , r2rJ , . . . , rJ r1, . . . , rJ rJ ,

r1r1r1, . . . , r1r1rJ , . . .}

and arrange all of the elements of the multiset Λ into a scaling sequence (λi)i≥0,
where λ0 := 1. (Note that 0 < λi < 1, for every i ≥ 1.)
A self-similar spray (or tiling), generated by the base set G and the ratio list
{r1, r2, . . . , rJ} is an RFD (∂Ω, Ω) in RN , where Ω is a disjoint union of open sets

5Note that the relative zeta function ζA,Ω(s) appearing in Equation (4.2.45) can be mero-
mophically extended in a unique way to the whole complex plane C since the same can be done
with ζ∂Ω0,,Ω0 (s). See, for example, Equation (4.2.40) dealing with the case when N = 2.

Gi; i.e.,

(4.3.3)

Ω :=

Gi,

∞Gi=0

such that each Gi is congruent to λiG, for every i ≥ 0. Here, the disjoint union
⊔ can be understood as the disjoint union of RFDs given in Deﬁnition 2.18, with
(Ai, Ωi) := (∂Gi, Gi) for each i ≥ 0, in the notation of that deﬁnition. In the sequel,
(∂G, G) is also referred to as a self-similar RFD.

Remark 4.19. Note that in the above deﬁnition, the scaling sequence (λi)i≥0

consists of all the products of ratios r1, . . . , rJ appearing in the inﬁnite sum

(4.3.4)

∞Xn=0(cid:18) JXj=1

after expanding the powers and counted with their multiplicities. More precisely,
we have that for every multi-index α = (α1, . . . , αJ ) ∈ NJ
0 , the multiplicity of
rα1
1 rα2

in the multiset Λ is equal to the multinomial coeﬃcient

2 . . . rαJ

j=1 αj. Of course, depending on the ratios r1, . . . , rJ , some of the

2 . . . rαJ

J may be equal for diﬀerent multi-indices α ∈ NJ
0 .

Furthermore, the condition (4.3.1) ensures that the set Ω = ⊔i≥0Gi has ﬁnite

N -dimensional Lebesgue measure. Indeed, we have

(4.3.6)

|Ω| =

∞Xi=0

since (4.3.1) is satisﬁed. Note that the second to last equality above follows from
the construction of the scaling sequence (λi)i≥0.

Consider now a self-similar spray as a relative fractal drum (A, Ω); that is, let
A := ∂Ω and Ω := ⊔i≥0Gi (see Deﬁnition 4.18). The ‘self-similarity’ of (A, Ω) is
nicely exhibited by the scaling relation (4.3.7) given in the following lemma.

Lemma 4.20. Let (A, Ω) be a self-similar spray in RN , as in Deﬁnition 4.18.
Then, the relative fractal drum (A, Ω) satisﬁes the following ‘self-similar identity’:

(4.3.7)

(A, Ω) = (∂G, G) ⊔

rj (A, Ω),

JGj=1

where (with the exception of the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (4.3.7)) the
symbol ⊔J
j=1 indicates that this represents a disjoint union of copies of (A, Ω) scaled
by factors r1, . . . , rJ and displaced by isometries of RN .

4.3. SELF-SIMILAR SPRAYS AND RFDS

75

Proof. Let us re-index the scaling sequence (λi)i≥0 in a way that keeps track
of the actual construction of the numbers λi out of the scaling ratios r1, . . . , rJ ; see
Equation (4.3.2) above. We let

(4.3.8)

I := {∅} ∪

∞[m=1
{1, . . . , J}m

be the set of all ﬁnite sequences consisting of numbers 1, . . . , J (or, equivalently, of
all ﬁnite words based on the alphabet {1, . . . , J}). Furthermore, for every α ∈ I,
deﬁne

(4.3.9)

λα :=(1,

α = ∅
rα1 rα2 ··· rαm , α 6= ∅.

We then deduce from the construction of (A, Ω) that

(A, Ω) =

(∂Gi, Gi) =

λi(∂G, G)

∞Gi=0

∞Gi=0
= Gα∈I

λα(∂G, G) = (∂G, G) ⊔ Gα∈I\{∅}

λα(∂G, G).

Observe now that in the last disjoint union above, every α ∈ {1, . . . , J}m can
be written as {j} × {1, . . . , J}m−1, for some j ∈ {1, . . . , J}, if we identify {j} with
{j}×{∅} when m = 1. Note that this identiﬁcation is consistent with the deﬁnition
of λα, in the sense that λ{j}×β = rj λβ for all j ∈ {1. . . . , J} and β ∈ I. In light
of this, we can next partition the last union above with respect to which number
j ∈ {1, . . . , J} the sequence α begins with:

(A, Ω) = (∂G, G) ⊔

= (∂G, G) ⊔

JGj=1 Gα∈{j}×I
rj(cid:18)Gβ∈I

λα(∂G, G) = (∂G, G) ⊔

λβ(∂G, G)(cid:19) = (∂G, G) ⊔

JGj=1Gβ∈I
JGj=1

rjλβ (∂G, G)

rj(A, Ω).

This completes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

In light of the identity (4.3.7), it is now clear that the distance zeta function of
(A, Ω) satisﬁes the following functional equation, which itself can be considered as
a self-similar identity:

(4.3.10)

ζA,Ω(s) = ζ∂G,G(s) +

ζrj (A,Ω)(s),

JXj=1

for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large.6 Furthermore, for such s, by using the
scaling property of the relative distance zeta function (Theorem 2.16), we deduce
that the above equation then becomes

(4.3.11)

ζA,Ω(s) = ζ∂G,G(s) +

rs
j ζA,Ω(s).

JXj=1

6For instance, it suﬃces to assume that Re s > N since, by Theorem 2.1, all of the zeta

functions appearing in (4.3.10) are holomorphic on the right half-plane {Re s > N }.

76

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

Finally, this last identity together with an application of the principle of analytic
continuation now yields the following theorem.

{r1, r2, . . . , rJ}, with rj > 0 (for j = 1, . . . , J , J ≥ 2) and such that PJ

More speciﬁcally, given a connected open neighborhood U of the critical line
{Re s = D}, ζA,Ω has a meromorphic continuation to U if and only if ζ∂G,G does,
and in that case, ζA,Ω(s) is given by (4.3.12) for all s ∈ U . Consequently, the visible
complex dimensions of (A, Ω) satisfy

(i.e., the scaling complex dimensions of the fractal spray). Finally, if there are no
zero-pole cancellations in (4.3.12), then we have an equality in (4.3.14).

Remark 4.22. (Complex dimensions and the deﬁnition of fractality). In [Lap-
vFr1–3], a geometric object is said to be “fractal” if the associated zeta function has
at least one nonreal complex dimension (with positive real part). (See [Lap-vFr3,
§12.1 and §12.2] for a detailed discussion.) In [Lap-vFr2, Lap-vFr3], in order,
in particular, to take into account some possible situations pertaining to random
fractals (see [HamLap], partly described in [Lap-vFr3, §13.4]), the deﬁnition of
fractality (within the context of the theory of complex dimensions) was extended so
as to allow for the case described in part (i) of Deﬁnition 2.38 just above, namely,
the existence of a natural boundary along a screen. (See [Lap-vFr3, §13.4.3].)
We note that in [Lap-vFr3] (and the other aforementioned references), the
term “hyperfractal” was not used to refer to case (i) (or to any other situation).
More important, except for fractal strings and in very special higher-dimensional sit-
uations (such as suitable fractal sprays), one did not have to our disposal (as we now
do, thanks to the general theory developed in this memoir and in [LapRaˇZu1–7])
a general deﬁnition of “fractal zeta function” associated with an arbitrary bounded
subset of RN , for every N ≥ 1. Therefore, we can now deﬁne the “fractality” of any
bounded subset of RN (including Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set) and, more gen-
erally, of any relative fractal drum, by the presence of a nonreal complex dimension
or else by the “hyperfractality” (in the sense of part (i) of Deﬁnition 2.38) of the
geometric object under consideration. Here, “complex dimension” is understood
as a (visible) pole of the associated fractal zeta function (the distance or tube zeta
function of a bounded subset or a relative fractal drum of RN , or else, as was the
case in most of [Lap-vFr3], the geometric zeta function of a fractal string).

4.3. SELF-SIMILAR SPRAYS AND RFDS

77

Much as in [Lap-vFr1–3] and [Lap3–8], this terminology (concerning fractal-
ity, hyperfractality, and complex dimensions), can be extended to ‘virtual geome-
tries’, as well as to (absolute or) relative fractal drums, noncommutative geometries,
dynamical systems, and arithmetic geometries, via suitably associated ‘fractal zeta
functions’, be they absolute or relative distance or tube zeta functions, spectral
zeta functions, dynamical zeta functions, or arithmetic zeta functions (or their log-
arithmic derivatives thereof).

We will return to the discussion of the notion of fractality in the closing chapter

of this memoir, namely, Chapter 5.

Example 4.23. (The 1/2-square fractal). In this planar example, we will fur-
ther investigate and illustrate the new interesting phenomenon which occurs in the
case of the Sierpi´nski 3-gasket RFD discussed in Example 4.14. Namely, we start
with the closed unit square I = [0, 1]2 in R2 and subdivide it into 4 smaller squares
by taking the centerlines of its sides. We then remove the two diagonal open smaller
squares, denoted by G1 and G2 in Figure 5, so that G := G1∪G2 is our generator in
the sense of Deﬁnition 4.18. Next, we repeat this step with the remaining two closed
smaller squares and continue this process, ad inﬁnitum. The 1/2-square fractal is
then deﬁned as the set A which remains at the end of the process; see Figure 5,
where the ﬁrst 6 iterations are shown. More precisely, the set A is the closure of the
union of the boundaries of the disjoint family of open squares appearing in Figure
5 and packed in the unit square I. If we now let Ω := (0, 1)2, we have that (A, Ω)
is an example of a self-similar spray (or tiling), in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.18, with
generator G = G1 ∪ G2 and scaling ratios r1 = r2 = 1/2. Note, however, that A
is not a (homogeneous) self-similar set in the usual sense (see, e.g., [Fal1, Hut]),
deﬁned via iterated function systems (or, in short, IFS), but it is an inhomogeneous
self-similar set.

More speciﬁcally, the set A is the unique nonempty compact subset of R2 which

is the solution of the inhomogeneous ﬁxed point equation

(4.3.15)

A =

2[j=1

Φj(A) ∪ B,

where Φ1 and Φ2 are contractive similitudes of R2 with ﬁxed points located at the
lower left vertex and the upper right vertex of the unit square, respectively, and
with a common scaling ratio equal to 1/2 (i.e., r1 = r2 = 1/2, where {rj}2
j=1 are the
scaling ratios of the self-similar RFD (A, Ω)). Furthermore, the nonempty compact
set B in Equation (4.3.15) is the union of the left and upper sides of the square
G1 and the right and lower sides of the square G2; see Figure 5. We note that
here, the corresponding (classic or homogeneous) self-similar set (i.e., the unique
nonempty compact subset C of R2 which is the solution of the homogeneous ﬁxed
point equation, C = ∪2
j=1Φj(C)), is the diagonal C of the unit square connecting
the lower left and the upper right vertices of the unit square.

Let us now compute the distance zeta function ζA of the 1/2-square fractal.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that δ > 1/4; so that we have

(4.3.16)

ζA(s) = ζA,Ω(s) + ζI (s),

where, intuitively, ζI denotes the distance zeta function corresponding to the ‘outer’
δ-neighborhood of A. Clearly, ζI is equal to the distance zeta function of the unit

also Figure 4, which describes the way we subdivide both G1 and G2) and by using
local Cartesian coordinates (x, y) ∈ R2 to deduce that

an identity valid initially for all s ∈ C such that Re s > 1, and then, after meromor-
phic continuation, for all s ∈ C. Finally, by combining Equations (4.3.16)–(4.3.19),
we conclude that the distance zeta function ζA is meromorphic on all of C and is
given by

Consequently, we have that dimB A exists,7

(4.3.21)

and

(4.3.22)

D(ζA) = dimB A = 1,

P(ζA) := P(ζA, C) = {0} ∪ (1 + piZ)

dimP C A := Pc(ζA) = 1 + piZ,

where the oscillatory period p of A is given by p := 2π
log 2 . All of the complex dimen-
sions in P(ζA) are simple except for ω = 1, which is a double pole of ζA. Finally,
we note that in light of Equation (4.3.21) (and hence, in light of the presence of
nonreal complex dimensions), the set A is indeed fractal according to our proposed
deﬁnition of fractality given in Remark 4.22 and further discussed in Chapter 5
below. In fact, according to Equation (4.3.22), it is critically fractal (i.e., fractal in
dimension d := 1 = dimB A, in the sense of Chapter 5).

Example 4.24. (The 1/3-square fractal). In the present planar example, we
illustrate a situation which is similar to that of the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -
gasket RFD discussed in Example 4.14 for N ≥ 4. Again, we start with the closed
unit square I = [0, 1]2 in R2 and subdivide it into 9 smaller congruent squares
(similarly as in the case of the Sierpi´nski carpet). Next, we remove 7 of those
smaller squares; that is, we only leave the lower left and the upper right squares
(see Figure 6). In other words, our generator G (in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.18) is
the (nonconvex) open polygon depicted in Figure 6.

As usual, we proceed by iterating this procedure with the two remaining closed
(The ﬁrst 4 iterations are
squares and then continue this process ad inﬁnitum.
depicted in Figure 6.) The 1/3-square fractal is then deﬁned as the set A which
remains at the end of the process. We now let Ω := (0, 1)2, which makes the RFD
(A, Ω) a self-similar spray (or tiling), in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.18, with generator
G and scaling ratios {rj}2
j=1 such that r1 = r2 = 1/3. Again, the set A is not a
homogeneous self-similar set, but is instead an inhomogeneous self-similar set.

More speciﬁcally, the set A is the unique nonempty compact subset of R2 which

is the solution of the inhomogeneous equation

(4.3.23)

A =

2[j=1

Φj(A) ∪ B,

where Φ1 and Φ2 are contractive similitudes of R2 with ﬁxed points located at the
lower left vertex and the upper right vertex of the unit square, respectively, and
with a common scaling ratio equal to 1/3. Furthermore, the set B in Equation
(4.3.23) is equal to the boundary of G without the part belonging to the boundary
of the two smaller squares which are left behind in the ﬁrst iteration; see Figure 6.
We also observe that here, the corresponding (classic or homogeneous) self-similar
set generated by the IFS consisting of Φ1 and Φ2, is the ternary Cantor set located
along the diagonal of the unit square.

7The existence of dimB A in Example 4.23 (as well as in Examples 4.24 and 4.25 below)

follows from [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.30] (see also [LapRaˇZu8, Theorem 4.2].)

80

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

Figure 6. The 1/3-square fractal A from Example 4.24. The ﬁrst 4
iterations are depicted. Here, G is the single generator of the corre-
sponding self-similar spray or RFD (A, Ω), in the sense of Deﬁnition
4.18.

We now proceed by computing the distance zeta function ζA of the 1/3-square

fractal. Without loss of generality, we may assume that δ > 1/4; so that we have

(4.3.24)

ζA(s) = ζA,Ω(s) + ζI (s),

where, as before in Example 4.23, ζI denotes the distance zeta function correspond-
ing to the ‘outer’ δ-neighborhood of A and coincides with the distance zeta function
of the unit square I := [0, 1]2. Recall that ζI was computed in Example 4.23 and
is given by Equation (4.3.17).

Furthermore, by using Theorem 4.21, we obtain that

Next, we compute the distance zeta function of (∂G, G) by subdividing G into
14 congruent triangles denoted by Gi, for i = 1, . . . , 14 (see Figure 6). Therefore,
by symmetry, we obtain the following functional equation:

ζ∂G,G(s) = 12ζ∂G,G1(s) + 2ζ∂G,G13,

(4.3.26)
valid initially for all s ∈ C such that Re s is suﬃciently large.

an identity valid initially for all s ∈ C with Re s > 1 and then, after meromorphic
continuation, for all s ∈ C.

Consequently, we deduce that dimB A exists,

(4.3.31)

and

D(ζA) = dimB A = 1,

P(ζA) := P(ζA, C) ⊆ {0} ∪ (log3 2 + piZ) ∪ {1}

dimP C A := Pc(ζA) = {1},
(4.3.32)
where the oscillatory period p of A is given by p := 2π
log 3 . In Equation (4.3.31), we
only have an inclusion since, in principle, some of the complex dimensions with real
part log3 2 may be canceled by the zeros of 6/(s − 1) + Z(s). However, it can be
checked numerically that log3 2 ∈ P(ζA) and that there also exist nonreal complex
dimensions with real part log3 2 in P(ζA). All of the complex dimensions in P(ζA)
are simple. We also note that A is indeed fractal, according to our proposed deﬁni-
tion of fractality (see Remark 4.22 above and Chapter 5 below). More precisely, in
light of Equations (4.3.31) and (4.3.32), it is strictly subcritically fractal and fractal
in dimension d = log3 2, in the sense of Chapter 5.

Example 4.25. (A self-similar fractal nest).

In the ﬁnal planar example of
this section, we investigate the case of a self-similar fractal nest.8 The set A which
we now deﬁne is an inhomogeneous self-similar set. Similarly as in Example 4.24,
the set A will be fractal in the sense of our proposed deﬁnition of fractality given
in Remark 4.22 and, moreover, will be strictly subcritically fractal in the sense of
Chapter 5.

8As we shall see, throughout this example, the use of the adjective “self-similar” is somewhat

abusive since only one similarity transformation is involved.

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

Let a ∈ (0, 1) be a real parameter. We deﬁne the set A as the union of con-
centric circles with center at the origin and of radius ak for k ∈ N0 (see Figure
7). Furthermore, let G be the open annulus such that ∂G consists of the circles of
radius 1 and a, as depicted in Figure 7, and let Ω := B1(0). We can now consider
the RFD (A, Ω) as a self-similar spray with generator G, in the sense of Deﬁnition
4.18.

We note that even though (A, Ω) is a fractal spray, with a single generator G,
it is not (strictly speaking) self-similar in the traditional sense because it only has
one scaling ratio r = a (associated with a single contractive similitude). However,
we will continue using this abuse of language throughout this example. Also, a
moment’s reﬂection reveals that this fact does not aﬀect any of the conclusions
relevant to the distance zeta function of such an RFD. Namely, we obviously have

so that

(4.3.34)

(A, Ω) = (∂G, G) ⊔ a(A, Ω);

ζA,Ω(s) = ζ∂G,G(s) + ζa(A,Ω)(s),

for all s ∈ C such that Re s is suﬃciently large. Furthermore, by using the scaling
property of the relative distance zeta function (see Theorem 2.16), we conclude that

(4.3.35)

ζA,Ω(s) =

again, for all s ∈ C such that Re s is suﬃciently large.

(4.3.37)

ζA,Ω(s) =

22−sπ(1 + a)(1 − a)s−1

(s − 1)(1 − as)

.

Finally, we ﬁx an arbitrary δ > (1− a)/2 and observe that for the distance zeta

function of A, we have

(4.3.38)

ζA(s) = ζA,Ω(s) + ζA,B1+δ (0)\Ω(s),

for all s ∈ C with Re s suﬃciently large. Furthermore, we have that

where the last equality is valid, initially, for all s ∈ C such that Re s > 1, and then,

Combining now the above equation with (4.3.38), we ﬁnally obtain that ζA is
meromorphic on all of C and is given by

(4.3.40)

ζA(s) =

Consequently, we have that dimB A exists,

In closing, we mention that A is indeed fractal according to our proposed deﬁ-
nition of fractality (see Remark 4.22 and Chapter 5). More speciﬁcally, in light of
Equation (4.3.41), A is strictly subcritically fractal and fractal in dimension d := 0,
in the sense of Chapter 5 below.

4. GENERATING PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

4.4. Generating principal complex dimensions of relative fractal drums

of any multiplicity

A key tool in generating (principal) complex dimensions of higher multiplicities
is the tensor product of bounded fractal strings, which we now brieﬂy deﬁne; see
[LapRaˇZu3] for more details.
If L1 := (ℓ1j)j≥1 and L2 := (ℓ2k)k≥1 are two
given bounded fractal strings, then the tensor product L1 ⊗ L2 is deﬁned as the
multiset consisting of all possible products of the form ℓ1jℓ1k for all ordered pairs
(j, k) ∈ N2; hence, we take into account the multiplicities. It is easy to see that the
tensor product L1 ⊗L2 is also a bounded fractal string. Furthermore, we have that
the geometric zeta function of the tensor product is equal to the product of each of
the component geometric zeta functions. More speciﬁcally, we have that

(4.4.1)
for all s ∈ C with Re s > max{D(ζL1 ), D(ζL2 )} and

ζL1⊗L2(s) = ζL1 (s) · ζL2 (s)

see [LapRaˇZu3, Lemma 4.36].

D(ζL1⊗L2 ) = max{D(ζL1 ), D(ζL2 )};

The following example provides a class of bounded relative fractal drums, gen-
erated by an a-string, which illustrates Theorem 2.24 above. Note that here, we
have a unique, nonsimple, principal complex dimension, D, on the critical line,
and that its multiplicity is equal to an arbitrarily prescribed positive integer m.
We shall need the notion of the disjoint union (of an at most countable family) of
bounded fractal strings Lm = (ℓmj)j≥1 for m ∈ N:

(4.4.2)

L :=

Lm,

∞Gm=1

deﬁned as the multiset L consisting of elements of the union of fractal strings,
counting their multiplicities. Assuming, additionally, that ℓm1 → 0+ as m → ∞,
it is easy to see that the mulitplicity of each of the elements of the multiset L :=
⊔∞m=1Lm is ﬁnite, so that L is indeed a bounded fractal string.

Example 4.26. (m-th order a-string) Let L(a) := {ℓk := k−a − (k + 1)−a}∞k=1
be the a-string, where a > 0 (see [Lap1, Example 5.1] and [Lap-vFr3, §6.5.1]),
and let m be a positive integer. Let Lm(a) be deﬁned by L1(a) := L(a) for m = 1
and as the (m − 1)-fold tensor product for m ≥ 2; that is,

(4.4.3)

Lm(a) :=(L(a)

L(a) ⊗ ··· ⊗ L(a)

for m = 1,
for m ≥ 2,

which we call the m-th order a-string. Then D = 1/(1+a) is the only principal com-
plex dimension of Lm(a), and it is of multiplicity m. Deﬁning h(t) := (log t−1)m−1
for all t ∈ (0, 1), and using [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 6.13], we obtain that the fractal
string Lm(a) is h-Minkowski measurable. Moreover, also according to [LapRaˇZu5,
Theorem 6.13] (see also [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.5.19]), we have that Lm(a) has
the following tube asymptotics:

|At| = t1−Dh(t) (M + o(1))

(4.4.4)
where M ∈ (0, +∞) is the h-Minkowski content of Lm(a) and can be explicitly com-
puted in terms of the −m-th coeﬃcient c−m of the Laurent expansion of the tube

as t → 0+,

4.4. PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF RFD-S OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

85

zeta function ˜ζA around s = D, as follows: M = c−m/(m − 1)!; see [LapRaˇZu5,
Theorem 6.13]. In particular, Lm(a) is h-Minkowski measurable.
In [LapRaˇZu3, §4.4], we have constructed a (Cantor-type) bounded fractal
string Lm which has inﬁnitely many principal complex dimensions of arbitrary
prescribed multiplicity m ≥ 2. The bounded fractal string was obtained by taking
m− 1 consecutive tensor products of the usual Cantor string LCS; i.e., the (m− 1)-
fold tensor product:

(4.4.5)

Lm :=(LCS

LCS ⊗ ··· ⊗ LCS

for m = 1,
for m ≥ 2,

which we call m-th order Cantor string or the m-Cantor string in short. The
corresponding multiset of principal complex dimensions is

(4.4.6)

dimP C Lm = log3 2 +

2π
log 3 iZ,

and each of its elements has multiplicity m. Note that by [LapRaˇZu8, Theorem
3.1] (see also [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.20]), the m-th order Cantor string Lm
is not Minkowski measurable. Instead, it can be shown that as a consequence of
[LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.3.16] or [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.16], it is h-Minkowski
nondegenerate with h(t) := (log t−1)m−1 for all t ∈ (0, 1).

Furthermore, by letting

(4.4.7)

L∞ :=

3−m
m! Lm,

∞Gm=1

we obtain a bounded fractal string L∞, called the Cantor string of inﬁnite order
or the ∞-Cantor string, such that its geometric zeta function ζL∞
has an inﬁnite
sequence of essential singularities along the critical line {Re s = D}, located at each
of the points D + ipk (with k ∈ Z, D := log3 2 and p := 2π/ log 3) of the periodic
set deﬁned by the right-hand side of (4.4.6).

L := Lm(a) ⊔ L∞,

Example 4.27. Let m be a ﬁxed positive integer and let a be a positive real
number chosen small enough, so that D := 1/(1 + a) > log3 2. Consider the
following bounded fractal string L deﬁned by
(4.4.8)
where the bounded fractal strings Lm(a) (m-th order a-string) and L∞ (∞-Cantor
string) are deﬁned by Equations (4.4.3) and (4.4.7), respectively, and generated by
tensor products of a-strings and Cantor strings, respectively. Here, we have that
Dmer(ζL) = log3 2, since the geometric zeta function
ζL(s) = ζLm(a)(s) + ζL∞
(4.4.9)

is holomorphic on the connected open set {Re s > 0} \(cid:0){D} ∪ (log3 2 + 2π
log 3 iZ)(cid:1),
where D = dimB L and is the (unique) pole of ζL of order m in the open right
half-plane {Re s > 0}, while log3 2 + 2π
log 3 iZ is the set of essential singularities of
ζL in {Re s > 0}. Denoting by AL := {ak :=P∞j=k ℓj : k ∈ N} the standard rep-
resentation of the fractal string L := {ℓj}∞j=1, and applying [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem
5.4.27] to the RFD (AL, (AL)δ) (for any ﬁxed positive real number δ),9 we obtain
9The open right half-plane {Re s > Dmer(ζL)} does not contain any other poles of ζL, except

(s)

for s = D.

( see [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.27]). According to [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.29],
1+a − log3 2 appearing on the right-hand side of Equation (4.4.11), is
the exponent
optimal; i.e., it cannot be replaced by a larger exponent.

In Examples 4.28 and 4.29 below, we construct Minkowski measurable RFDs
which possess inﬁnitely many complex dimensions of arbitrary multiplicity m, with
m ≥ 1, or even essential singularities.

Example 4.28. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the unit square RFD (A0, Ω0) by Ω0 := [0, 1]2

and A0 := ∂Ω0. We introduce the RFD

(A′m, Ω′m) := (A0, Ω0) ⊔ Lm,

(4.4.12)
where we embed Lm via its canonical geometric representation ALm into the x-axis
of the 2-dimensional plane R2. Since ζA′m,Ω′m(s) = ζA0,Ω0 (s) + ζLm(s), we have that
(4.4.13)
where P′ := log3 2 + 2π
log 3 iZ and each of the complex dimensions D + ipk (with
k ∈ Z, D := log3 2) of P′ is of multiplicity m. On the other hand, the only
principal complex dimension of (A′m, Ω′m) is 1, and it is simple (i.e., of multiplicity
1). Therefore, according to [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 5.2], the RFD (A′m, Ω′m) is
Minkowski measurable.

P(˜ζA′m,Ω′m ) = {0, 1} ∪ P′,

Example 4.29. Let us again deﬁne the unit square RFD (A0, Ω0) by Ω0 :=

[0, 1]2 and A := ∂Ω. We introduce the RFD

(Am, Ωm) := (A0, Ω0) ⊗ Lm,

(4.4.14)
where Lm is the m-th order Cantor string deﬁned by (4.4.5), and the tensor product
of the RFD (A0, Ω0) and Lm is deﬁned analogously as in Example 4.3 above. Using
Equation (4.1.9) from Theorem 4.6 above (see also Equation (4.1.14) from Theorem
4.8), we obtain that

(4.4.15)

ζAm,Ωm(s) = ζA0,Ω0 (s) · ζLm (s) =

g(s)

s(s − 1)(3s − 2)m .

Here, g(s) is an entire function without zeros at 0, 1 or at any point of the arithmetic
set

(4.4.16)

In other words,

P′ := log3 2 +

2π
log 3 iZ.

dimP C (Am, Ωm) = {1}, P(Am, Ωm) = {0, 1} ∪ P′,

(4.4.17)
and each complex dimension of (A, Ω) lying in the arithmetic set P′ has multi-
plicity m. The value of D := dimB(Am, Ωm) = 1 is the only complex dimension
located on the critical line {Re s = 1}, while the inﬁnite set P′ is contained in

4.4. PRINCIPAL COMPLEX DIMENSIONS OF RFD-S OF ANY MULTIPLICITY

87

the line {Re s = log3 2} located strictly to the left of the critical line.
It fol-
lows from [LapRaˇZu5, Theorem 6.13] (or [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.29]) that
the RFD (A, Ω) is h-Minkowski measurable with respect to the gauge function
h(t) := (log t−1)m−1, for all t ∈ (0, 1).
We can further deﬁne the RFD

(A∞, Ω∞) :=

Similarly as above, we have that (with P′ given by (4.4.16))
(4.4.19)
and each complex dimension of (A∞, Ω∞) lying in the arithmetic set P′ = log3 2 +
log 3 iZ is an essential singularity of ζA∞,Ω∞

dimP C (A∞, Ω∞) = {1}, P(A∞, Ω∞) = {0, 1} ∪ P′,

CHAPTER 5

Fractality, complex dimensions and singularities

We close this memoir by specifying, within the general theory of fractal zeta
functions developed here and in [LapRaˇZu1–7], the elusive notion of “fractality”.
Much as in [Lap-vFr1–3] (see, especially, [Lap-vFr3, §12.1 and §13.4.3]), but now
using the general higher-dimensional notion of fractal zeta function and associated
notion of complex dimensions, we say that a bounded set A (or, more generally,
an RFD (A, Ω)) in RN is fractal if it has at least one nonreal (visible) complex
dimension (i.e., a nonreal pole for its associated fractal zeta function),1 relative
to some screen S, or else if there exists a screen S which is a natural boundary
for its fractal zeta function (i.e., such that the fractal zeta function cannot be
meromorphically extended to the left of S). In the latter situation, A (or, more
generally, (A, Ω)) is said to be hyperfractal. In particular, it is said to be strictly
hyperfractal if we may choose S = {Re s = D}, and maximally hyperfractal if the
critical line S = {Re s = D} consists entirely of nonremovable singularities of the
fractal zeta function; see Deﬁnition 2.38. Here, as before, we let D := dimBA (or
D := dimB(A, Ω). Recall that in Theorem 2.40, we have constructed a family of
maximally hyperfractal RFDs.

5.1. Fractal and subcritically fractal RFDs

In this memoir, we have seen many examples of fractals (that are not hyper-
fractal), for instance, the Cantor string or set, the relative Sierpi´nski gasket and
carpet (Examples 4.12 and 4.15) or, more generally, the relative N -gasket RFD and
the N -carpet RFD (Examples 4.14 and 4.17), along with the examples discussed in
§4.3. Among these examples, some have nonreal complex dimensions located on the
critical line (such as, for instance, the Cantor string, the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski
gasket and carpet RFDs, the N -carpet RFD for any N ≥ 2, as well as the inhomo-
geneous N -gasket (AN , ΩN ) when N = 2 or 3). These are called critically fractal.
Yet others only have nonreal complex dimensions with real parts strictly less than
D. The latter are called subcritically fractal. In addition, strictly subcritical fractals
are subcritical fractals which do not have any nonreal principal complex dimensions
(i.e., complex dimensions with real part D). Examples of strictly subcritical fractals
include the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFD when N ≥ 4 (see Example
4.12 above) as well as the modiﬁed devil’s staircase (or Cantor graph) RFD to be
discussed in Example 5.1 below.

Finally, we complete this list of deﬁnitions by stating that, given d ∈ R, the
bounded set A (or, more generally, the RFD (A, Ω)) is fractal in dimension d if it
has nonreal complex dimensions of real parts d. (In light of Theorem 2.1, we must

1Provided D := dimB A (resp., dimB (A, Ω)) < N , it does not matter whether we use ζA or

˜ζA (resp., ζA,Ω or ˜ζA,Ω) throughout this deﬁnition.

89

90

5. FRACTALITY, COMPLEX DIMENSIONS AND SINGULARITIES

then necessarily have d ≤ N .) Hence, a critical fractal is such that d := D, while
a strictly subcritical fractal is such that d < D. For instance, with the notation
of Example 4.14, for N ≥ 4, the Sierpi´nski N -gasket RFD (AN , ΩN ) is fractal in
dimension

(5.1.1)

d = σ0 = log2(N + 1) < D = N − 1 = dimB(AN,0, ΩN,0)

but not in dimension D, and therefore, it is strictly subcritically fractal. By con-
trast, when N = 2 or 3, it is critically fractal (indeed, in those cases, it is fractal in
dimension d := D = σ0, the similarity dimension).

We point out that, much as as was the case in the one-dimensional situation
in [Lap-vFr3, Chapter 12], based on the general explicit formulas and fractal tube
formulas obtained in [Lap-Fr1–3] (see, especially, [Lap-vFr3, Chapters 5 and 8]),
the deﬁnitions of fractality, critical fractality and (strict) subcritical fractality are
justiﬁed in part by the general fractal tube formulas obtained in [LapRaˇZu5] (see
also [LapRaˇZu1, Chapter 5]).2 Indeed, the latter tube formulas show that, under
mild assumptions, the presence of nonreal complex dimensions of real part d ∈ R
corresponds to oscillations of order d in the geometry of A (or of (A, Ω)). Similarly,
roughly speaking, critical fractality (along with the simplicity of D) corresponds to
the Minkowski nonmeasurability of A (or (A, Ω)), while strict subcritical fractality
(still assuming the simplicity of D) not only corresponds to (critical) Minkowski
measurability but also to (strictly subcritical) Minkowski nonmeasurability in di-
mension d < D. This is the case, for instance, for the inhomogeneous Sierpi´nski
N -gasket RFD (see Example 4.12) whenever N ≥ 4 (and avoiding nongeneric val-
ues of N ), for the RFDs of Examples 4.24 and 4.25, as well as for the (modiﬁed)
devil’s staircase RFD, which we discuss in Example 5.1 just below.

Finally, we mention that in reference [Lap-vF6] of [Lap-vFr2–3], it was con-
jectured that a generic nonlattice self-similar string is fractal in a countably inﬁ-
nite set of dimensions which is dense in some compact interval [Dmin, D], where
Dmin < D. (See also §3.7 of [Lap-vFr2–3].) This conjecture has now been proved
in [MorSepVi1], along with the fact (also observed independently in [Lap-vFr3,
§3.7.1]) that in the nongeneric case, the above set of fractality is dense in ﬁnitely
many compact intervals (rather than in a single one). According to the results
of [LapPe3] and [LapPeWi1] (or, more generally, in light of Theorem 4.21 of
§4.3 in the present work), the same conclusions hold for (generic and nongeneric)
self-similar sprays and tilings (see Deﬁnition 4.18). More generally, we expect that
under suitable mild assumptions, self-similar sets and RFDs (satisfying the open
set condition) enjoy the same properties.

5.2. The Cantor graph relative fractal drum

Example 5.1. (The Cantor graph RFD). In this example, we compute the
distance zeta function of the RFD (A, Ω) in R2, where A is the graph of the Cantor
function and Ω is the union of triangles △k that lie above and the triangles ˜△k
that lie below each of the horizontal parts of the graph denoted by Bk. (At each

2These fractal tube formulas generalize to any N ≥ 1 and to arbitrary bounded sets A (or,
more generally, RFDs) in RN the ones obtained for fractal strings (i.e., when N = 1) in [Lap-
vFr1–3] (see, especially, [Lap-vFr3, Chapter 8]), as well as for the very special but important
case of fractal sprays, in [LapPe2–3] and, more generally, in [LapPeWi1–2] (see [Lap-vFr3,
§13.1] for an exposition).

5.2. THE CANTOR GRAPH RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUM

step of the construction there are 2k−1 mutually congruent triangles △k and ˜△k.)
Each of these triangles is isosceles, has for one of its sides a horizontal part of the
Cantor function graph, and has a right angle at the left end of Bk, in the case of
△k, or at the right end of Bk, in the case of ˜△k. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1. The third step in the construction of the Cantor graph rel-
ative fractal drum (A, Ω) from Example 5.1. One can see, in particular,
the sets Bk, △k and ˜△k for k = 1, 2, 3.

For obvious geometric reasons and by using the scaling property of the relative
distance zeta function of the resulting RFD (A, Ω) (see Theorem 2.16), we then
have the following identity:

ζA,Ω(s) =

all of C:

(5.2.3)

ζA,Ω(s) =

for all s ∈ C.

We therefore deduce that the set of complex dimensions of the RFD (A, Ω) is given

dimP C (A, Ω) := Pc(ζA,Ω) = {1}.

We conclude from part (b) of Theorem 2.1 that dimB(A, Ω) = 1 and that the
RFD (A, Ω) is Minkowski measurable. Moreover, one also deduces from [LapRaˇZu8,
Theorem 4.2] (or [LapRaˇZu1, Theorem 5.4.2]) that the (one-dimensional) Minkowski
content of (A, Ω) is given by

res(ζA,Ω, 1)

= 2,

(5.2.6)

M1(A, Ω) =

2 − 1

which coincides with the length of the Cantor graph (i.e., the graph of the Cantor
function, also called the devil’s staircase in [Man]).

In the sequel, we associate the RFD (A, A1/3) in R2 to the classic Cantor
graph. We do not know if the right-hand side of (5.2.4) coincides with the set
of complex dimensions of the ‘full’ graph of the Cantor function (i.e., the original
devil’s staircase), or equivalently, the RFD (A, A1/3), but we expect that this is
indeed the case since (A, Ω) is a ‘relative fractal subdrum’ of (A, A1/3). Moreover,
it is obvious that for the distance zeta function of the RFD (A, A1/3) associated
with the graph of the Cantor function, one has

ζA,A1/3 (s) = ζA,Ω(s) + ζA,A1/3\Ω(s).

(5.2.7)
In order to prove that P(ζA,Ω), given by (5.2.4), is a subset of the set of com-
plex dimensions of the ‘full’ Cantor graph, it would therefore remain to show that
ζA,A1/3\Ω has a meromorphic continuation to some connected open neighborhood
U of the critical line {Re s = 1} such that U contains the set of complex dimensions
of (A, Ω), as given by (5.2.4), and that there are no pole-pole cancellation in the
right-hand side of (5.2.7).

We now return to the RFD (A, Ω) (that is, the version of the Cantor graph). As
clearly follows from (5.2.4), (A, Ω) is fractal. More speciﬁcally, in light of (5.2.5),
it is not critically fractal (because its only complex dimension of real part DCG (=
D = dimB(A, Ω)) = 1 is 1 itself, the Minkowski dimension of the Cantor graph, and
it is simple) but it is strictly subcritically fractal. In fact, it is subcritically fractal
in a single dimension, namely, in dimension d := DCS = log3 2, the Minkowski
dimension of the Cantor set.

We expect the same result to hold for the devil’s staircase itself (i.e., the ‘full’
graph of the Cantor function), represented by the RFD (A, A1/3) and of which
(A, Ω) is a ‘relative fractal subdrum’, as was explained above. Clearly, in light of
(5.2.7) and (5.2.4), we have the following inclusions (between multisets):

(5.2.8)

P(ζA,A1/3) ⊆ P(ζA,Ω) ∪ P(ζA,A1/3\Ω)

⊆ {0, 1} ∪(cid:26)DCS +

2π

log 3 iZ(cid:27) .

Also, we know for a fact that dimB(A, A1/3) exists and

(5.2.9)

so that

(5.2.10)

D(ζA,A1/3) = dimB(A, A1/3) = 1,

dimP C (A, A1/3) := Pc(ζA,A1/3 ) = {1}.

5.2. THE CANTOR GRAPH RELATIVE FRACTAL DRUM

93

(Thus, we have that {1} ⊆ P(ζA,A1/3) in (5.2.8).) Note that (5.2.9) (and hence,
(5.2.10)) follows from the rectiﬁability of the devil’s staircase, combined with a
well-known result in [Fed2] and with part (b) of Theorem 2.1.

As was predicted in [Lap-vFr3, §12.1.2 and §12.3.2] (see also [Lap-vFr1–2]),
based on an ‘approximate tube formula’, we expect that P(ζA,A1/3) = P(ζA,Ω), as
given by (5.2.4), and hence, that we actually have equalities instead of inclusions
in (5.2.8), even equalities between multisets.
If so, then the ‘full’ Cantor graph
(A, A1/3) is fractal, not critically fractal, but (strictly) subcritically fractal in the
single dimension d := DCS = log3 2.

Clearly, both (A, Ω) and (A, A1/3) should be fractal for a proper deﬁnition of
fractality. This would completely resolve the following apparent paradox: the RFD
(A, A1/3) is not “fractal” according to Mandelbrot’s original deﬁnition of fractality
given in [Man],3 even though everyone feels and expects it to be “fractal” simply
after having glanced at the ‘full’ Cantor graph (A, A1/3) (the ‘devil’s staircase’ in
the terminology of [Man]). The same is true for the ‘partial’ Cantor graph (A, Ω),
for which we can now rigorously prove that it is “fractal” (in the sense of the
theory of complex dimensions) even though it is only (strictly) subcritically fractal,
which may explain, in hindsight, why some practitioners refer to it as a “borderline
fractal”.

We conclude this discussion by quoting (as in [Lap-vFr3, p. 335]) Mandelbrot
[Man, p. 82] writing about the devil’s staircase (the ‘full’ Cantor graph, depicted
in [Man, Plate 83, p. 83]):

One would love to call the present curve a fractal, but to achieve
this goal we would have to deﬁne fractals less stringently, on the
basis of notions other than D [the Hausdorﬀ dimension] alone.

Thanks to the higher-dimensional theory of complex dimensions of fractals and
associated fractal tube formulas developed in this memoir and in [LapRaˇZu1–7],
building on the corresponding theory for fractal strings developed in [Lap-vFr1–3],
we are now tentatively close to having resolved this apparent paradox. Furthermore,
if we use the ‘partial’ Cantor graph (A, Ω) as a suitable substitute for the ‘full’
Cantor graph, viewed as the RFD (A, A1/3), the corresponding paradox is indeed
completely resolved here. We invite the interested reader to extend the conclusions
of the present example (i.e., Example 5.1) from (A, Ω) to (A, A1/3), and thereby,
to fully prove the conjectures and statements made in [Lap-vFr3, §12.1.2] as well
as here about the devil’s staircase itself.

3Indeed, Mandelbrot’s deﬁnition, given in [Man, p. 15], can be stated as follows. A geometric
object is “fractal” if its Hausdorﬀ dimension is strictly greater than (i.e., is not equal to) its
topological dimension. However, note that the Hausdorﬀ, Minkowski and topological dimensions
coincide and are equal to 1 in the case of (either the ‘full’ or the ‘partial’) Cantor graph. If, in
addition, we replaced “Hausdorf dimension” by (relative, upper) “Minkowski dimension” in the
above deﬁnition and we interpreted the topological dimension in the obvious way, we would also
reach the analogous conclusion for both (A, A1/3) and (A, Ω), which therefore would still not be
fractal according to this modiﬁed Mandelbrot deﬁnition.
