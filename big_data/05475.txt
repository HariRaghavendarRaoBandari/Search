ON THE ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS

I: GLOBAL NORMALIZING FACTORS

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

To Freydoon Shahidi, for his upcoming 70th birthday

Abstract. We provide a uniform estimate for the L1-norm (over any interval of bounded
length) of the logarithmic derivatives of global normalizing factors associated to intertwin-
ing operators for the following reductive groups over number ﬁelds: inner forms of GL(n);
quasi-split classical groups and their similitude groups; the exceptional group G2. This
estimate is a key ingredient in the analysis of the spectral side of Arthur’s trace formula.
In particular, it is applicable to the limit multiplicity problem studied by the authors in
earlier papers.

1. Introduction

In this paper we study the analytic properties of the global intertwining operators asso-
ciated to parabolic subgroups of reductive groups G over number ﬁelds F . In the previous
papers [FLM15] (joint with Werner M¨uller) and [FL15], we deﬁned certain properties
(TWN) and (BD) pertaining to these intertwining operators, and showed that these two
properties together imply the solution of the limit multiplicity problem for congruence sub-
groups of lattices contained in G(F ). Property (TWN) is a global property concerning the
scalar-valued normalizing factors, while (BD) is essentially a local property. In [FLM15],
these properties were veriﬁed for the groups GL(n) and SL(n).

This paper is devoted to establishing property (TWN) in a number of other cases,
namely for inner forms of the groups GL(n) and SL(n), for quasi-split classical groups

and their similitude groups, and for the exceptional group G2. In fact, we prove without
any more eﬀort a ﬁner estimate (already mentioned in [FLM15]), which we call property
(TWN+). In addition to the application to the limit multiplicity problem, this property
may be useful in the study of other asymptotic questions, where it is important to control
the dependence on the archimedean parameters. The main examples of such problems are
Weyl’s law with remainder term and the asymptotics of Hecke operators in general families
[LM09b, Mat13, MT15]. In any case, the results of this paper are suﬃcient to extend the
limit multiplicity results of [FLM15, FL15] to inner forms of GL(n) and SL(n). This will
be discussed in a future paper, where we will also study property (BD) for general groups
G, and prove a weaker variant. This, together with the results of the current paper, will
allow for an extension of the limit multiplicity results to quasi-split classical groups and
their similitude groups and G2 (at least under a technical restriction on the congruence
subgroups in question).

We sketch the deﬁnition of property (TWN+), which is explained in more detail in §3
below. As usual, ﬁx a minimal Levi subgroup M0 of G deﬁned over F , and consider a
proper Levi subgroup M of G containing M0 and a root α ∈ ΣM . Let Uα be the unipotent
subgroup of G corresponding to α, Mα the group generated by M and U±α, and ˆMα its
F -simple normal subgroup generated by U±α. The group ˜Mα = ˆMα ∩ M is a maximal
Levi subgroup of ˆMα. For π ∈ Πdisc(M(A)) let nα(π, s) be the normalizing factor for
the global intertwining operators associated to pairs of parabolic subgroups of G adjacent
along α. These factors are meromorphic functions of ﬁnite order of the complex variable s
and satisfy the functional equation |nα(π, it)| = 1 for all t ∈ R.

We say that G satisﬁes property (TWN+) (tempered winding numbers, strong version)

if we have the estimate

Z T +1

T

|n′

α(π, it)| dt ≪ log(|T | + Λ(π∞; psc) + level(π; psc))

for all π ∈ Πdisc(M(A)) and all real numbers T where the implied constant depends only
on G. Here, level(π; psc) is a certain variant of the usual notion of the level of π restricted
to ˜Mα, and Λ(π∞; psc) measures the size of the inﬁnitesimal character of the restriction of
π∞ to ˜Mα. (See §2.5 for the precise deﬁnitions.) We note that property (TWN+) implies
property (TWN) introduced in [FLM15, Deﬁnition 5.2], and that property (TWN+) has
been shown (as a consequence of the theory of Rankin-Selberg L-functions) for the groups
GL(n) and SL(n) in [ibid., Proposition 5.5].

Our method of proving (TWN+) for the groups listed above, is to use functoriality to
transfer the problem to a well-understood problem for GL(n). We start by an axiomatic
treatment of automorphic L-functions in §2, which we then apply to the global normalizing
factors in §3. In §4 we will show (TWN+) for inner forms of GL(n) and SL(n) using the
Jacquet-Langlands correspondence (obtained in general in [Bad08], [BR10]), which allows
us to reduce the problem to known properties of Rankin-Selberg L-functions.

In §5, we will consider quasi-split classical groups. We ﬁrst consider the twisted ex-
terior and symmetric square L-functions for GL(n), as well as the Asai L-function for
ResE/F GL(n), using known results obtained by the Langlands-Shahidi method and by the

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

study of integral representations. Using Arthur’s work on functoriality from the classical
groups to GL(n) [Art13], extended by Mok to unitary groups [Mok15], we will be able once
again to reduce the remaining L-functions to Rankin-Selberg L-functions for GL(n).

Our approach is based on Arthur’s work, which requires the full force of the stable twisted
trace formula. Among the prerequisites of Arthur’s results are [KS99b, She12, Ren97,
DM08, LW13, Wal09, Wal08, Wal12, Wal14a, Wal14b, Wal14c, Wal14d, Wal14f, MW14a,
Wal14g, Wal14h, Wal14e, MW14b], to mention a few. One may contemplate whether there
is a diﬀerent approach to the problem which avoids functoriality (and is perhaps applicable
to other groups). Unfortunately, at the moment we cannot say anything in this direction.
For the exceptional group G2, which we treat in §6, we need to consider the (twisted)

symmetric cube L-function for GL(2) which was studied by Kim–Shahidi.

1.1.
It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Freydoon Shahidi for his upcoming 70th
birthday. Shahidi’s inﬂuence on the ﬁeld on automorphic forms cannot be overestimated.
Needless to say, the current paper also owes a lot to his work. On a personal level it has
always been a pleasure to interact with Freydoon and we wish him the very best.

2. Estimates for logarithmic derivatives of L-functions

We begin with an axiomatic treatment of automorphic L-functions which isolates the

precise properties needed for the main estimate (see Proposition 2.6 below).

2.1. Let us ﬁrst recall some generalities about L-functions. Let G be a reductive group
over a number ﬁeld F and let A be the ring of adeles of F . Let Aﬁn be the ring of ﬁnite
adeles of F and F∞ = F ⊗ R. Let |·|A× be the idele norm on A×. Let TG be the Q-split
part of the (Zariski) connected component of the center of ResF/Q G (restriction of scalars)
and let AG = TG(R)◦ (topological connected component), viewed as a subgroup of TG(AQ)
(and hence of G(A)). Let G(A)1 ⊂ G(A) be the intersection of the kernels ker |χ|A× as χ
ranges over the F -rational characters of G. Then G(A) is the direct product of G(A)1 and
AG. Let aG be the Lie algebra of AG, a real vector space, and a∗
G its dual space. We set
G,C = a∗
a∗
We write Πdisc(G(A)) for the set of equivalence classes of automorphic representations
of G(A) which occur in the discrete spectrum of L2(AGG(F )\G(A)). We will also write
Πcusp(G(A)) for the subset of cuspidal representations.

G ⊗ C.

For any π = ⊗vπv ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) let S(π) be the ﬁnite set of places of F such that at

least one of the following conditions holds:

(1) v is archimedean.
(2) F/Q is ramiﬁed at v.
(3) G is ramiﬁed at v, i.e., either G is not quasi-split over Fv or G does not split over

an unramiﬁed extension of Fv.

(4) For every hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup Kv of G(Fv), πv does not have

a nonzero vector invariant under Kv.

(The exclusion of the ﬁnite places which are ramiﬁed for F is inessential and is only made
for convenience.) We write S(π) = S∞ ∪ Sf (π), where S∞ denotes the set of archimedean

4

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

places of F and Sf (π) denotes the non-archimedean places in S(π). Let SQ,f (π) (or simply
SQ,f , if π is clear from the context) be the set of rational primes which lie below the primes
in Sf (π). Also set SQ(π) = SQ,f (π) ∪ {∞}.

Let WF be the Weil group of F and let LG be the L-group of G (cf. [Bor79]). Let r :
LG → GL(N, C) be a continuous and WF -semisimple N-dimensional representation of LG.
For any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) and any place v of F outside of S(π) we have the Hecke-Frobenius
parameter tπv ∈ LG. To each such v we associate the polynomial Pv(X) = det(1 −Xr(tπv))
v )−1. Since π is unitary, the absolute
of degree N and the local L-factor Lv(s, π, r) = Pv(q−s
values of the eigenvalues of r(tπv) are bounded by qα
v , where α depends only on G and r
([Lan70], [Bor79]). Therefore, for S ⊃ S(π) the partial L-function

LS(s, π, r) =Yv /∈S

Lv(s, π, r)

is well-deﬁned as an absolutely convergent product and holomorphic for Re s > α + 1.
Because of the unitarity of π, we also have

LS(s, π, r∨) = LS(¯s, π, r),

where r∨ is the contragredient of r. A cornerstone of the Langlands program is the (largely
conjectural) meromorphic continuation of these L-functions with ﬁnitely many poles in C.
As usual, we write ΓR(s) = π−s/2Γ(s/2) and ΓC(s) = 2(2π)−sΓ(s) = ΓR(s)ΓR(s + 1),

where Γ(s) is the standard Gamma function.

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a pair (G, r) has property (FE), if for any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A))
there exist rational functions Rp, p ∈ SQ,f (π), an integer m ≥ 1, a constant C∞ ∈ C∗ and
parameters α1, . . . , αm, α∨
m ∈ C, such that the partial L-function LS(s, π, r) admits
a meromorphic continuation to C with a functional equation of the form

1 , . . . , α∨

In general, this property is wide open except for a number of important special cases,

some of which will be considered below.

2.2. We ﬁrst address the uniqueness of the terms in (1). This is of course standard. For
completeness we give the details.

Lemma 2.2. Assume that (1) is satisﬁed for some ﬁxed r and π. Then

or equivalently,

LS(π)(s, π, r) =(cid:0) Yp∈SQ(π)

˜Rp(p−s),

where C is a non-zero constant, A is a positive real number and for all p ∈ SQ,f (π), ˜Rp is a
rational function with ˜Rp(0) = 1. Up to a ﬁnite multiset, the zeros of the ﬁrst product are
given (with multiplicities) by −αi − 2Z≥0, i = 1, . . . , m, while those of ˜Rp(p−s) are given
by s = (− log xp,i + 2πiZ)/ log p, where xp,1, . . . , xp,dp are the zeros of ˜Rp. Considering only
the zeros with Im s suﬃciently large, we see that the zeros of each rational function ˜Rp are
determined by φ. Arguing similarly with the poles, we conclude that each ˜Rp is determined
by φ.

Furthermore, if we have an equality

m′ = m, and that after possibly reindexing α1, . . . , αm and α∨

that αi − βi, α∨
i ∈ 2Z for all i, in which case ΓR(s + αi)/ΓR(s + βi) and ΓR(1 − s +

The ﬁrst two parts follow. The third and fourth parts immediately follow from the ﬁrst

α1, . . . , αm become reduced. The process must terminate after ﬁnitely many steps since

For p ∈ SQ,f (π) it follows from (3) that we can write in a unique fashion

(7)

γp(s, π, r) = cpp( 1

2 −s)ep(π,r)Pp(p−s)/ ¯Pp(ps−1),

where cp ∈ C∗, ep(π, r) ∈ Z, and Pp is a polynomial with Pp(0) = 1 such that no zeros α
and β of Pp satisfy α ¯β = p−1. Here ¯P is the polynomial obtained from P by taking complex
conjugates of the coeﬃcients. The degree of Pp is the number of zeros (or, equivalently,
poles) of Rp in C× (counted with multiplicities), and the integer ep(π, r) is the diﬀerence
between the order of Rp at X = 0 and the degree of Pp. We have seen that ep(π, r) and
Pp are uniquely determined by π and r. Analogously to the case p = ∞, the zeros of

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

Pp(p−s) are precisely the zeros of γp(s, π, r). Although we expect that ep(π, r) ≥ 0, we do
not impose this condition at the outset. We set

Lred
p (s, π, r) = Pp(p−s)−1,

p ∈ SQ,f (π),

and deﬁne the reduced completed L-function

and the reduced epsilon factor

Lred(s, π, r) =(cid:0) Yp∈SQ(π)

p (s, π, r))LS(π)(s, π, r) the “ﬁnite” part of Lred.

Remark 2.3. In many cases there is an alternative procedure to deﬁne a completed L-
function

We denote by Lred,f (s, π, r) = (Qp∈SQ,f (π) Lred
L(s) =(cid:0) Yp∈SQ(π)

(9)

˜Lp(s)(cid:1)LS(π)(s, π, r),

which may diﬀer from Lred(s). Here ˜L∞(s) =Q ˜m

i=1 ΓR(s + ˜αi) with some complex numbers
˜αi, and ˜Lp(s) = ˜Pp(p−s)−1 for p ∈ SQ,f (π), where ˜Pp are some polynomials satisfying
˜Pp(0) = 1. (For brevity, we say that factors ˜Lp(s), p ∈ SQ(π), of this shape are Euler
factors.) The advantage in working with Lred(s) is that it is uniquely determined by the
partial L-function LS(π) (and hence by π and r). Of course, it is only deﬁned if property
(FE) is known a priori.

In any case, as a consequence of the minimality of the local factors Lred

p (s), p ∈ SQ(π),
the reduced L-function Lred(s) satisﬁes the following minimality property. Suppose that a
function L(s) as in (9) satisﬁes a functional equation of the form

for some c ∈ C∗ and R > 0, where

L(s) = cR

for some Euler factors ˜L∨
˜Pp is divisible by Pp and ˜L∞(s)/Lred
Lred(s)/L(s) is an entire function. Moreover,

p (s), p ∈ SQ(π). Then for each p ∈ SQ,f (π), the polynomial
∞ (s, π, r) is a polynomial. In particular, the quotient

n(π, r)

R

= Yp∈SQ,f (π)

pdeg ˜Pp−deg Pp

is a positive integer.

Consider for example the case of G = GL(n) with the standard representation r = Stn.
If π ∈ Πcusp(G(A)) then the completed L-function LGJ(s, π, Stn) was deﬁned and studied
by Godement–Jacquet [GJ72]. The Jacquet-Shalika bounds on the local parameters of
generic representations imply that LGJ(s, π, Stn) is reduced. On the other hand, for any
m > 1 the L-function

LGJ(s +

m + 1

− j, π, Stn),

mYj=1

which is the completed L-function of a residual representation of GL(nm, A), is not reduced.

2.3. Our next task is to apply the standard argument of Riemann and von Mangoldt for
estimating the number of zeros of an L-function (cf., e.g., [IK04, §5.3]). For our purposes
we will need a weak form of this argument which works under the following supplementary
conditions.

Deﬁnition 2.4. We say that (G, r) satisﬁes property (FE+), if it satisﬁes property (FE)
and if in addition the following holds.

(1) There exists a polynomial P (s), whose degree is bounded in terms of (G, r) only,

such that P (s)LS(π)(s, π, r) is an entire function of ﬁnite order.

(2) The degrees of the polynomials Pp, p ∈ SQ,f , in (7), as well as the degree of the

factor γ∞ are bounded in terms of (G, r) only.

(3) There exists a real number β depending only on (G, r), such that the zeros of Pp,
p ∈ SQ,f , have absolute value ≥ p−β and such that γ∞(s, π, r) has no zeros in the
half-plane Re s > β (i.e., the reduced parameters αi satisfy Re αi ≥ −β).

We say that (G, r) has virtually property (FE+), if there exist representations r1 and r2

for which (G, ri) has property (FE+) and r ⊕ r1 = r2.

In practice, we will have deg γ∞ = N[F : Q] ≥ deg Pp for all p ∈ SQ,f (π). However, we
do not demand it at the outset. The most elusive condition in property (FE+) is in fact
the ﬁrst one — the boundedness of the number of poles of LS(s, π, r) independently of π.

Remark 2.5. It is clear that (G, r) satisﬁes (FE+) if and only if the same is true for (G, r∨).
An analogous remark is applicable for all subsequent properties deﬁned below.

We can now state the desired estimate. Recall the archimedean and arithmetic conduc-

tors deﬁned in (6) and (8), respectively. Here and throughout we write

A ≪ B

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

9

to mean that A is bounded by a constant multiple of B. The implied constant is allowed
to depend only on the pair (G, r).

Proposition 2.6. Suppose that (G, r) satisﬁes property (FE+). Then for any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A))
the meromorphic function

m(s, π, r) = ǫred(1, π, r)Lred(s, π, r)/Lred(s + 1, π, r)

satisﬁes |m(it, π, r)| = 1 for t ∈ R and

T

|m′(it, π, r)| dt ≪ log(|T | + 2) + log c∞(π, r) + log(n(π, r) Yp∈SQ,f (π)

p),

T ∈ R.

Proof. Although the argument is familiar, we will provide the details, since our assumptions
are somewhat weaker than usual. Let Λ(s, π, r) = n(π, r)s/2Lred(s, π, r). Then

(10)

Λ(s, π, r) = ǫred(

, π, r)Λ(1 − s, π, r).

Note that m(s, π, r) = Λ(s, π, r)/Λ(−s, π, r) and hence m(s, π, r) is holomorphic on the
imaginary axis and has absolute value one there. Moreover,

m′(it, π, r)
m(it, π, r)

= 2 Re

Λ′(it, π, r)

,

t ∈ R.

The function Λ(s) = Λ(s, π, r) is a quotient of holomorphic functions of order one,
and hence a meromorphic function of order one. For instance, the argument of [GL06,
Proposition 1] shows that there exist positive constants c1, c2, c3, depending also on π,
such that

Therefore Λ(s) admits a Hadamard factorization

(cid:12)(cid:12)P (s)LS(π)(s, π, r)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ c1(1 + |s|)max(c2,−c3 Re(s)),

Λ(s) = ea+bssn(0)Yρ6=0

s ∈ C.

where a, b ∈ C, the product ranges over the zeros and poles of Λ(s) other than 0, and n(ρ)
is the order of the function Λ(s) at s = ρ (possibly negative). Also,

By the second and third condition of Deﬁnition 2.4, there exist an integer m ≥ 1 and a
constant A ≥ 2, depending only on G and r, such that for all primes p the Euler factor at p
of Lred(s, π, r) is a product of at most m factors (1 − αp,ip−s)−1 with |αp,i| ≤ pA−2 for all p
and i, and such that the poles of the factor at inﬁnity L∞ lie in the half-plane Re s ≤ A−2.
(In fact, we may take A = max(α, β) + 2.) Therefore, the Euler product Lred,f (s, π, r) is
absolutely convergent for Re s > A − 1, and because of the condition on L∞ and the
functional equation (10), all zeros and poles ρ of Λ(s) lie in the strip 2 − A ≤ Re s ≤ A − 1.

Remark 2.7. It is clear that in Proposition 2.6 it is in fact suﬃcient to require that (G, r)
has virtually property (FE+). Similarly, it suﬃces to know that the number of poles of

LS(π)(s, π, r) is ≪ log c∞(π, r) + log(n(π, r)Qp∈SQ,f (π) p).

In order to make the connection to asymptotic problems, we need to control n(π, r)
(resp., c∞(π, r)) in terms of the level of π (resp., the size of the inﬁnitesimal character of
π∞). Fix once and for all a faithful F -rational representation ρ : G → GL(V ) and an
oF -lattice Λ in the representation space V . The stabilizer of ˆΛ = ˆoF ⊗ Λ ⊂ Aﬁn ⊗ V in
G(Aﬁn) is an open compact subgroup Kﬁn, and any maximal compact subgroup of G(Aﬁn)
can be realized this way. For any non-zero ideal n of oF let

K(n) = KG(n) = {g ∈ G(Aﬁn) : ρ(g)v ≡ v

(mod nˆΛ),

v ∈ ˆΛ}

be the principal congruence subgroup of level n, a factorizable normal open subgroup of
Kﬁn. The groups K(n) form a neighborhood base of the identity element in G(Aﬁn). We

12

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

denote by N(n) = [oF : n] the ideal norm of n. We deﬁne the level of an admissible
representation π of G(A) by level(π) = N(n), where n is the largest ideal such that πK(n) 6=
0. Analogously, for any ﬁnite place v of F we deﬁne the level levelv(πv) of a smooth

representation πv of G(Fv). Thus, level(π) =Qv levelv(πv) where v ranges over the ﬁnite

places of F and almost all of the factors are 1. Note that there exists an integer n,
depending only on G, such that for any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) we have:

(13)

p divides level(π) for any rational prime p ∈ SQ,f (π) coprime to n.

We ﬁx a maximal compact subgroup K∞ of G(F∞) and set K = K∞Kﬁn.
Fix a Cartan subalgebra hC of the complexiﬁed Lie algebra (g∞)C of G(F∞) and a
Euclidean norm k·kC on h∗
C which is invariant under the Weyl group W ((g∞)C, hC). For
any (smooth) non-zero representation π of G(F∞), which has an inﬁnitesimal character χπ,
we deﬁne

Λ(π) = 1 + kχπk2,

where we view χπ as an orbit in h∗

C under W ((g∞)C, hC).

Remark 2.8. In [FLM15, §5.1] the slightly diﬀerent invariant

Λ′(π) = 1 + λ2

π + minkτ k2

is used (and denoted there by Λ(π)), where λπ is the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator of
G(F∞), τ ranges over the K∞-types of π and the norm kτ k is the one deﬁned by Vogan
(cf. [CD84, §2.2]). By a standard argument (cf. [Vog81, §6.5–6.6]), there exist constants
c1, c2 > 0, depending only on G, such that

c1Λ′(π) < Λ(π)2 < c2Λ′(π).

Therefore, for all practical purposes there is no diﬀerence between Λ(π) and Λ′(π).

We thus make the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.9. Suppose that the pair (G, r) satisﬁes property (FE+). We say that the
conductor condition (CC) is satisﬁed, if there exists c > 0 (depending only on G and r),
such that

(14)

and

(15)

for all π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)).

n(π, r) ≪ level(π)c

c∞(π, r) ≪ Λ(π∞)c

Condition (CC) is certainly expected to hold in general (cf. [BAPS13]), although it is
not clear whether, strictly speaking, its non-archimedean part (14) formally follows from
Langlands’s principle of functoriality or the local Langlands conjecture for G. For the
archimedean part (15) see Remark 2.10 below.

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

2.4. The standard paradigm for proving (FE) (e.g., through the Langlands-Shahidi method
or an integral representation, cf. [GS88]) goes by deﬁning local factors γ•
v(s, π, r), that sat-
isfy certain properties, most importantly

(FE’)

LS(s, π, r) =(cid:0)Yv∈S

γ•

v(s, π, r)(cid:1)LS(1 − s, π, r∨)

for any ﬁnite set S ⊃ S(π). (In each particular case the superscript • will be replaced
by an appropriate acronym.) The local factors γ•
v(s, π, r) normally depend on a choice
of a character ψv of Fv. We will suppress this choice by taking ψF = ψQ ◦ TrF/Q where

ψQ =Qp ψQp is the standard character of Q\AQ (characterized by ψR = e2πi·) and writing

ψF = ⊗ψv, i.e., ψv = ψFv = ψQp ◦ TrFv/Qp, if v lies above p. If we want to emphasize that
γ•
v(s, π, r) depends only on πv (as it is in the usual paradigm) we will write it as γ•
v (s, πv, r).
However, we will not make it a part of our requirements. This ﬂexibility will be useful in
sections 4 and 5, where we will use functoriality to study analytic properties of L-functions.
v (s, π, r) (which for
simplicity we denote by (ΓF)). Here, n is a positive integer and β a real number which
depend only on (G, r). (In practice n = N = deg r.)

In addition to (FE’) we will impose the following conditions on γ•

(1) For every ﬁnite v, the function γ•

(3) For all v ∈ S(π), the function γ•

v,mv ∈ C, where mv ≤ n.
v(s, π, r) has no zeros for Re s > β.

Let us make a few comments about these conditions.
First, as before, we do not impose that e•

v(π, r) ≥ 0 for v ∈ Sf (π) (although in practice
v X −1) to have
this will always be the case). Also, for v ﬁnite we allow Pv(X) and Qv(q−1
common zeros. Thus, e•
v (s, π, r) itself. How-
ever, this ambiguity is immaterial for our purpose since diﬀerent presentations (16) give
rise to values of e•

v(π, r) does not depend only on the function γ•

v(π, r) which diﬀer by an integer of absolute value ≤ n.

14

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

Similarly, for v ∈ S∞ we allow the numerator and denominator in the expression (17) to

have common poles. We set

c•

v(π, r) =(cid:0) mvYi=1

As in the proof of Lemma 2.2, c•

v(π, r) depends only on the factor γ•

v (s, π, r) and not on

v,1, . . . , α∨

v,mv. (In practice we always have mv = N.)

Note that the functional equation (FE’) implies that for all v /∈ S(π) we have

Finally, it implies (FE) with

part of condition (CC) is implied by the condition

Note that this property (in contrast to the value of e•

Remark 2.10. In many cases one knows that the archimedean factors are compatible with
the Langlands classiﬁcation in the following sense. For v ∈ S∞, let Wv be the Weil group
of Fv and let φv : Wv → LG be the Langlands parameter attached to πv. Then
(CL)

γ•
v (s, π, r) = γv(s, r ◦ φv, ψv) := ǫv(s, r ◦ φv, ψv)Lv(1 − s, r∨ ◦ φv)/Lv(s, r ◦ φv),

where the L- and ǫ-factors on the right-hand side are as in [Tat79, §3]. It is easy to see
that condition (CL) for all v ∈ S∞ implies (AF) (with c = N/2).

We sum up the discussion as follows.

Corollary 2.11. For a given pair (G, r), suppose that for all π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) the following
conditions are satisﬁed.

(1) There exists a polynomial P (s), whose degree is bounded in terms of (G, r) only,

such that P (s)LS(π)(s, π, r) extends to an entire function of ﬁnite order.

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

15

(2) There exist local factors γ•

v(s, π, r) (for all places v of F ) satisfying (FE’), (ΓF),

(AF) and (CC’).

Then (G, r) satisﬁes properties (FE+) and (CC).

The following observation will be useful.

Lemma 2.12. Suppose that for all triplets (M, π, r′), where M is a Levi subgroup of G
deﬁned over F (including G itself ), π ∈ Πcusp(M(A)) is a cuspidal representation of M(A),

and r′ is an irreducible constituent of r(cid:12)(cid:12)LM , conditions (1) and (2) of Corollary 2.11 are

satisﬁed (with M instead of G and r′ instead of r). Then (G, r) satisﬁes properties (FE+)
and (CC).

Proof. Let π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)). Then there exist σ ∈ Πcusp(M(A)) and λ ∈ a∗
M,C such that π is
a subquotient of the representation I(σ, λ) parabolically induced from the twist of σ by the
character of M(A)/M(A)1 determined by λ [BJ79, Supplement]. We have S(σ) ⊂ S(π),
level(σ) ≪ level(π) and Λ(σ∞) + kλk2 ≪ Λ(π∞). Also, by the unitarity of π, kRe λk is
i=1ri according to the central character,

bounded in terms of G only. Decompose r(cid:12)(cid:12)LM = ⊕k

and let β∨

i be the element of aM corresponding to the central character of ri. Then

We take

LS(π)(s, π, r) =

v(s, π, r) =

LS(π)(s + hλ, β∨

γ•
v (s + hλ, β∨

kYi=1

Then properties (1) and (2) for (G, π, r) immediately follow from the corresponding prop-
erties of (M, σ, ri), i = 1, . . . , k (cf. Remark 2.3).
(cid:3)

2.5. At this stage it will be useful to introduce a slight reﬁnement of the notion of level. For
the rest of this section let G′ be a closed connected normal subgroup of G and p : H → G′
a ﬁnite covering of G′ (with H connected), both deﬁned over F . Note that p(H(F )) is a
normal subgroup of G′(F ) and that G′(F )/p(H(F )) is an abelian group of ﬁnite exponent
(bounded by the size of the kernel of p), and similarly for p(H(A)) ⊂ G′(A).

For any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) we write level(π; p) = N(n), where n is the largest ideal such
that πK(n)∩p(H(A)) 6= 0. (Note that the same notion was considered in [FLM15, §5.1], where
the notation level(π; p(H(A))) was used.) Analogously, we deﬁne levelv(πv; p) for a smooth
representation πv of G(Fv). We also set

(18)

Λ(π∞; p) = ΛG′

where on the right-hand side Λ is taken with respect to G′. Alternatively, Λ(π∞; p) =
1 + kχπ∞;pk2, where χπ∞;p is the projection of χπ∞ to (hC ∩ Lie(G′(F∞))C)∗.

Lemma 2.13. There exists an integer N1, depending only on p and G, such that for
any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) there exists σ ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) and a character χ of G′(A) trivial on

(π∞(cid:12)(cid:12)G′(F∞)),

16

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

G′(F )p(H(A)) such that level(σ) divides N1 level(π; p) and σχ is a subrepresentation of

π(cid:12)(cid:12)G′(A). In particular, ΛG′(σ) = Λ(π∞; p).

Proof. We ﬁrst reduce the lemma to the case G′ = G. Namely, we show that there exists
an integer N2, depending only on G and G′, such that for any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) there exists
a subrepresentation σ ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) of π|G′(A) with level(σ; p) dividing N2 level(π; p).

Let C be the centralizer of G′ in G. Then CG′ = G, and therefore G′(F∞)C(F∞) has
ﬁnite index in G(F∞). Since the maximal compact subgroup K∞ meets every connected
component of G(F∞), we have G(F∞) = G′(F∞)C(F∞)K∞. Combining this fact with the
well-known ﬁniteness of the class number of G [PR94, Theorem 8.1], we see that the coset
space

X = G(F )\G(A)/G′(A)C(F∞)K

is ﬁnite. Fix a set of representatives {g1, . . . , gr} for the classes of X.

Let π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)). Note that since CG′ = G, G(A)/C(A)G′(A) is compact, and

therefore, the restriction π(cid:12)(cid:12)G′(A) decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible representations.
i ∩ p(H(Aﬁn)). Decomposing the span of ˜φ(cid:12)(cid:12)G′(A) under

Let φ be an automorphic form on G(A) in the isotypic space of π, which is right-invariant
under the group K(n) ∩ p(H(Aﬁn)). Then there exist i = 1, . . . , r, k ∈ KM and c ∈ C(F∞),
such that the function ˜φ := φ(·cgik) does not vanish on G′(F )\G′(A). The function ˜φ is
clearly invariant under giK(n)g−1
G′(A) into irreducibles, we obtain an irreducible subrepresentation σ ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) of
π|G′(A) such that level(σ; p) divides N2 level(π; p), where the integer N2 depends on G only,
as required.

So assume from now on that G′ = G. It remains to show that there exists an integer
N3, depending only on p, such that for any σ ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) there exists a character
χ : G(A)/G(F )p(H(A)) → C× such that level(σχ−1) divides N3 level(σ; p). Recall from
[FLM15, Lemma 5.1] that

levelv(σv; p) = min
χv

levelv(σvχ−1

v ),

where χv ranges over the characters of G(Fv)/p(H(Fv)). Since G(Fv)/p(H(Fv)) is ﬁnite for
all v, it suﬃces to show the following assertion. There exists a ﬁnite set S0 of ﬁnite places
of F , depending on p only, such that for any ﬁnite set S of ﬁnite places of F outside S0
and a family of characters ˜χv of G(Fv)/p(H(Fv)) for v ∈ S, there exists a global character
χ : G(A)/G(F )p(H(A)) → C×, unramiﬁed outside S ∪ S0, such that χv ˜χ−1
is unramiﬁed
v
for all v ∈ S. (We use the fact that levelv(πvχv) ≪ levelv(πv) for any character χv of
G(Fv)/p(H(Fv)), v ∈ S0.)

For convenience we write ˜K = G(F∞)Kﬁn. We ﬁrst show that the group

(G(F ) ∩ p(H(A)) ˜K)/p(H(F ))

is ﬁnitely generated. Indeed, choose representatives x1, . . . , xk for the ﬁnite double coset
space H(F )\H(A)/p−1( ˜K), and let yi = p(xi). Then G(F ) ∩ p(H(A)) ˜K is the union over
i = 1, . . . , k of

G(F ) ∩ p(H(F ))yi ˜K = p(H(F ))(G(F ) ∩ yi ˜K).

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

If δi ∈ G(F ) ∩ yi ˜K, then G(F ) ∩ yi ˜K = (G(F ) ∩ δi ˜Kδ−1
generated group. Our claim follows.

i )δi, which is a coset of a ﬁnitely

Let Γ be the image of G(F ) ∩ p(H(A)) ˜K in G(Aﬁn)/p(H(Aﬁn)). Since the latter is
abelian of ﬁnite exponent, Γ is necessarily ﬁnite, and therefore projects injectively into
G(FS0)/p(H(FS0)) for a suitable ﬁnite set S0 depending only on p. It is therefore possible

to extend the character Qv∈S ˜χv of KS to a character of ˜K/(G(F )p(H(A)) ∩ ˜K), which

is trivial on Kv for any v /∈ S ∪ S0. Extending this character to G(A)/G(F )p(H(A)) we
obtain the desired χ.

The last assertion of the lemma is clear, since χ is trivial on the connected component
(cid:3)

of the identity of G(F∞).

The following observation will also be useful.

Lemma 2.14. Assume that G′ contains the derived group of G and let Lι : LG → LG′
be the corresponding homomorphism of L-groups. Let r′ be a representation of LG′ and let
r = r′ ◦ Lι. Assume that (G, r) satisﬁes (FE+) and (CC). Then (G′, r′) satisﬁes (FE+)
and (CC).

We ﬁrst need the following standard result.

Lemma 2.15. Let T be a torus over F . Then there exists a compact subset C of the
Pontryagin dual T (F∞)D = Hom(T (F∞), C1) of T (F∞), such that for any character χ of
T (A) there exists a character ˜χ of T (F )\T (A) such that ˜χχ−1 is unramiﬁed at all ﬁnite
places and ˜χ∞χ−1

∞ ∈ C.

Proof. Indeed, let T (F∞)1 = T (F∞) ∩ T (A)1. Then X := T (F )T (F∞)1Qv ﬁnite T (Ov) is a
closed subgroup of ﬁnite index of T (A)1 and the group Γ := T (F ) ∩ T (F∞)1Qv ﬁnite T (Ov)

is a lattice in T (F∞)1. Therefore, there exists a compact subset C of (T (F∞)1)D, such that
its image under the restriction map

3. Global normalizing factors and L-functions

In this section we consider the global normalizing factors associated to intertwining
operators. We switch therefore to a slightly diﬀerent setting. Let G be an isotropic
reductive group deﬁned over F , and M a proper Levi subgroup of G containing a ﬁxed
maximal F -split torus T0. As usual, we let P(M) be the set of all parabolic subgroups of G,
deﬁned over F , with Levi subgroup M. For any P ∈ P(M) with unipotent radical NP let
− 1
A2(P ) be the space of automorphic forms ϕ on NP (A)M(F )\G(A) such that δ
P ϕ(·k) ∈
2
L2
disc(AM M(F )\M(A)) for all k ∈ K, where δP denotes the modulus function of P (A). For
each pair P, Q ∈ P(M) there is a global intertwining operator

MQ|P (λ) : A2(P ) → A2(Q),

which has meromorphic continuation in λ ∈ a∗

M,C [Art82, §1].

Let ΣM ⊂ a∗

M be the set of reduced roots of TM on the Lie algebra of G, and for any
P ∈ P(M) let ΣP ⊂ ΣM be the set of reduced roots of TM on the Lie algebra nP of NP .
We say that two parabolic subgroups P, Q ∈ P(M) are adjacent along α ∈ ΣM , and write
P |αQ, if ΣP ∩ −ΣQ = {α}. The study of the operators MQ|P (λ) reduces to this case.
Let π ∈ Πdisc(M(A)). We are interested in the corresponding normalizing factors nα(π, s)
introduced by Langlands and Arthur (see [Art82, §6], [Art89]). They are meromorphic
functions of a complex variable s, and are closely connected to certain automorphic L-
functions studied by Langlands and Shahidi. (As the notation suggests, nα depends only
on α and not on the choice of parabolic subgroups P |αQ. The precise deﬁnition of nα and
its relation to the intertwining operators MQ|P (λ) is described in [ibid.]. We will not need
it here.)

To describe the relevant representations of the L-group LM, let Uα be the unipotent
subgroup of G corresponding to α (so that the eigenvalues of TM on the Lie algebra of Uα
are positive integer multiples of α). Let Mα be the group generated by M and U±α. It is
a Levi subgroup of G deﬁned over F containing M as a co-rank one Levi subgroup. Let
ˆMα be the subgroup of Mα ∩ Gder generated by U±α. By [BT65, Proposition 4.11] ˆMα is
a connected normal subgroup of Mα deﬁned over F . Hence ˜Mα := M ∩ ˆMα is a normal
subgroup of M. Moreover, since M has co-rank one in Mα, precisely one simple root β of
Mα restricts to α, which implies that the root system of ˆMα is the irreducible component of
the root system of Mα containing β. The group ˆMα is therefore F -simple, and ˜Mα is a Levi
subgroup of co-rank one. (In particular, ˜Mα is connected.) Let ˆM sc
α be the simply connected
α → ˆMα the natural projection. By abuse of notation we write
α → ˜Mα the

α is not semisimple.) We denote by psc : ˜M sc

α = (psc)−1( ˜Mα). (Of course ˜M sc

˜M sc

cover of ˆMα, and fpsc : ˆM sc
restriction of fpsc to ˜M sc

α . We note that psc( ˜M sc

α (A)) ∩ ˜Mα(A).

The L-group LMα of Mα admits a parabolic subgroup LPα = LM ⋉ LUα corresponding
to α whose Levi part LM is the L-group of M. The representation of LM relevant for
the theory of intertwining operators is (the contragredient of) the adjoint representation
of LM on Lie(LUα). We have a sequence of homomorphisms of reductive groups

α (A)) =fpsc( ˆM sc

ˆM sc

α −։ ˆMα ֒−→ Mα,

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

19

which restricts to

α −։ ˜Mα ֒−→ M.
The dual sequences of homomorphisms of L-groups are

˜M sc

and

LMα −→ L ˆMα −→ L( ˆM sc

α ) = (L ˆMα)ad

LM −→ L ˜Mα −→ L( ˜M sc

α ) = L ˜Mα/Z(L ˆMα),

respectively. The adjoint action of LM on Lie(LUα) clearly factors through the composed
homomorphism. We decompose the contragredient of the adjoint representation of L ˜Mα
on Lie(LUα) as ⊕l
j=1rj, where the (irreducible) subrepresentation rj is the eigenspace of
weight −j of the fundamental weight corresponding to α, considered as a cocharacter of
the center of L ˜Mα/Z(L ˆMα).

The normalizing factor nα(π, s) is closely related to the L-functions LS(js, π, rj), j =
1, . . . , l, which emerged in the famous computation by Langlands of the constant term of
the corresponding Eisenstein series [Lan71]. Langlands used this to show the meromorphic
continuation of these L-functions to the entire complex plane (at least in the cuspidal
case, but the general case follows from the cuspidal case as in the argument of Lemma
2.12). These L-functions are also known to have ﬁnite order as meromorphic functions.
In the cuspidal case this is [GL06, Theorem 2], which is based on the results of M¨uller
[M¨ul89, M¨ul00]. The general case follows once again from the argument of Lemma 2.12.
However, the ﬁner analytic properties of LS(s, π, rj), such as properties (FE+) and (CC)
considered in this paper, are more elusive (cf. Remark 3.7 below).

We now summarize the pertinent properties of the normalizing factors nα(π, s). The

ﬁrst one is the functional equation

which is equivalent to

The second is a factorization

nα(π, s)nα(π, −¯s) = 1,

|nα(π, it)| = 1,

t ∈ R.

nα(π, s) =Yv

nα,v(π, s)

as an absolutely convergent product for Re s suﬃciently large. The local factors nα,v(π, s)
are assumed to satisfy the following properties.

(1) For all ﬁnite v, nα,v(π, s) is a rational function in X = q−s

v , whose degree is bounded

in terms of G only and which is regular and non-zero at X = 0.

(2) If v ∈ S∞, then

where cv 6= 0, α1, . . . , αNv ∈ C and the integers Nv ≥ 1 and ji ≥ 1, i = 1, . . . , Nv,
are bounded in terms of G only.

20

(3) Write π = ⊗πv. If v is ﬁnite, ˜Mα is unramiﬁed at v and the pull-back πv ◦ psc of πv

to ˜M sc

α (Fv) contains an unramiﬁed subrepresentation σv, then

(19)

nα,v(π, s) =

Lv(js, σv, rj)

Lv(js + 1, σv, rj)

.

lYj=1

Remark 3.1. The ﬁrst and second property are clear from [Art89] (and moreover nα,v(π, s)
depends only on πv, or in fact on πv ◦ psc – cf.
[CL14, Theorem 3.3.4]). For v ∈ S∞, by
[Art89, §3] we have in fact

nα,v(πv, s) =

Lv(js, rj ◦ φv)

Lv(js + 1, rj ◦ φv)

,

lYj=1

where φv : Wv → LM is the Langlands parameter associated to πv. However, we will only
need the qualitative property stated above. The third property is implicit in [Art89]. We
omit the details.

Remark 3.2. We can rewrite the assumption on πv in (3) in an equivalent way by saying
that πv| ˜Mα(Fv ) contains an irreducible subrepresentation of the form σvχv, where σv is an
unramiﬁed representation of ˜Mα(Fv) and χv is a character of ˜Mα(Fv)/psc( ˜M sc

α (Fv)).

We now introduce the property (TWN+), which is the main object of this paper.

Deﬁnition 3.3. The group G satisﬁes property (TWN+) (tempered winding numbers,
strong version) if, for any proper Levi subgroup M of G deﬁned over F , and any root
α ∈ ΣM we have the estimate

for all π ∈ Πdisc(M(A)) and all real numbers T .

Recall that the invariants Λ(π∞; psc) and level(π; psc) are deﬁned in §2.5. (Of course,
the ambient group is M in our case.) As explained in [FLM15, Remark 5.3, part 2],
this property implies property (TWN) for G formulated in [ibid., Deﬁnition 5.2], which is
relevant to the limit multiplicity problem.

In view of the description of the unramiﬁed factors of nα(π, s), it is no wonder that
the property (TWN+) is intimately related to analytic properties of the automorphic L-
functions LS(s, π, rj). In the special cases G = GL(n) and G = SL(n) this was spelled out
in [ibid., Proposition 5.5]. Here, we will analyze it in the general case.

Deﬁnition 3.4. We say that G satisﬁes property (L), if for any standard Levi subgroup
M, any α ∈ ΣM , and any irreducible constituent r = rj of the representation (AdLUα)∨ of
the group L ˜Mα, the pair ( ˜Mα, r) satisﬁes properties (FE+) and (CC).

Remark 3.5. It is clear from the deﬁnition that property (L) depends only on the derived
group of G.

Remark 3.6. We expect that every group satisﬁes property (L). Using [GS01, Proposition
3.1], it is possible to reduce this question to the constituent r1.
Remark 3.7. Suppose that G is quasi-split and that π is a generic cuspidal representation
of M(A). (If M is isogenous to a product of general linear groups, then this condition is
satisﬁed for all cuspidal representations π.) By the results of Shahidi, the meromorphic
function LS(π)(s, π, r) satisﬁes then a functional equation of the form (1). Moreover, local
factors γSh
v (s, πv, r) are deﬁned and satisfy (FE’), (ΓF) and (CL) [Sha90]. Shahidi’s work
also gives that under some mild assumptions which are known in almost all cases (see
[KK11] and the references therein), these L-functions admit ﬁnitely many poles and are
of order one (see [GS01], with some complements in [GL06]). However, the poles are
controlled by those of the corresponding Eisenstein series in the right-half plane, and in
general it is not clear how to bound the number of the latter in terms of G only. (This is
known in several cases and is expected to hold in general.) Therefore, even granted the
reduction to the generic case, without additional input we cannot conclude from Shahidi’s
work by itself that r has property (FE+).

In addition, it is not clear how to approach property (CC’) using the Langlands-Shahidi

method (although it is certainly not excluded that this is possible).

In the cases at hand we will supplement the information from Shahidi’s work by using
integral representations of Rankin–Selberg type, which give better control of the poles of
(at least) the partial L-functions as well as of the local γ-factors.

We now have the following implication.

Proposition 3.8. Suppose that G satisﬁes property (L). Then it satisﬁes property (TWN+).

This result essentially follows from Proposition 2.6. We ﬁrst need a simple lemma to

account for the ramiﬁed local factors.
Lemma 3.9. Let P be a polynomial of degree d and let f (s) = P (p−s). Then

for all T ∈ R. Similarly let f (s) = ΓR(s+α)

ΓR(s+1+α) for some α ∈ C. Then

for all T ∈ R.

Proof. For the ﬁrst part, it is enough to consider the case P (z) = 1 − αz with α ∈ C. (The
left-hand side vanishes for P (z) = z.) Absorbing the argument of α into T , we may also
assume without loss of generality that α ∈ R. Note that then

Remark 3.10. For Proposition 3.8 to hold, we may replace the condition (FE+) in the
deﬁnition of property (L) by the weaker condition that (FE+) holds virtually (cf. Remark
2.7). It would be interesting to know whether one can further weaken the assumptions in
Proposition 3.8.

In the next sections we will prove:

Theorem 3.11. The following groups satisfy property (L), and hence also property (TWN+).

(1) GL(n) and its inner forms.
(2) Quasi-split classical groups.
(3) The exceptional group G2.

Thus, by Remark 3.5, the same holds for any group whose derived group coincides with the
derived group of any one of the groups above.

The proof is based on a case-by-case analysis of the L-functions appearing in the deﬁ-
nition of property (L). The quasi-splitness assumption in part 3 comes from the fact that
we use functoriality to GL(n), which at the moment is only available in this case. (See
Remark 5.7 below.) In each case we will use Corollary 2.11 for appropriately deﬁned local
factors. We will also often use Lemma 2.12 to reduce to the cuspidal case.

24

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

4. Inner forms of GL(n)

We ﬁrst consider the groups GL(n) and their inner forms. In order to prove Theorem

3.11 in this case, in view of Lemma 2.14 it suﬃces to show the following

Theorem 4.1. Let G = G1 × G2, where Gi is an inner form over F of GL(ni), i = 1, 2,
and r = Stn1 ⊗ Stn2 where Stn is the standard n-dimensional representation of GL(n, C).
Then the pair (G, r) satisﬁes properties (FE+) and (CC).

This theorem will be proved in the rest of this section.

4.1. We start with the case n2 = 1. Let G be an inner form of GL(n) and let π ∈
Πcusp(GL(n, A)). For any Hecke character χ of F we have

LS(s, π × χ, Stn × St1) = LS(s, π ⊗ χ, St),

where π ⊗χ denotes the twist of π by χ. Therefore, it suﬃces to show that (G, Stn) satisﬁes
(FE+) and (CC). The standard L-function for π was studied by Godement–Jacquet [GJ72].
In particular, Stn has property (FE+) and the local factors

γGJ(s, πv, Stn) = ǫGJ(s, πv, Stn)

LGJ(1 − s, π∨

v , Stn)

LGJ(s, πv, Stn)

deﬁned by Godement–Jacquet (with respect to the ﬁxed character ψv as in §2.4) satisfy
(FE’), (ΓF) and (CL) (and in particular (AF)). (Of course, in the case n = 1 these are
Tate’s local factors.) For brevity we write for v ﬁnite

c(πv) := eGJ

v (πv, Stn)

(see (16)). This is the usual conductor of πv.

Property (CC’) for (G, Stn) follows from the following standard result.1

Lemma 4.2. Let F be a non-archimedean ﬁeld with residue ﬁeld Fq, D a central division
algebra over F of degree d and G = GL(m, D). Let OD be the maximal order of D and let
̟D be a prime element of D. Let π be an irreducible representation π of G and let

l = min{i ≥ 0 : πKi 6= 0},

where K0 = GL(m, OD) and Ki = 1 + ̟i
n = md.

DMm(OD), i > 0. Then c(π) ≤ n + m(l − 1) where

Proof. The result follows from the relation between conductor and depth proved recently
in [BAPS13]. (See also [BF85, Bus87, Bus91, LR03, BH07] and the appendix of [Bad02].)
For convenience we provide an easy, self-contained argument.

1In the case where D = F and πv is generic, it follows from the well-known description of c(πv) due to
Jacquet–Piatetski-Shapiro–Shalika [JPSS81a], that c(πv) ≥ logq levelv(πv). In [FLM15, Lemma 5.6] it was
asserted that we should always have c(πv) ≤ logq levelv(πv) for D = F , which is not true. After replacing
this incorrect conductor bound by the upper bound n logq levelv(πv) of the current Lemma 4.2, the rest of
the argument of [ibid.] goes through without any change.

If l = 0, i.e.

if πK0 6= 0, then c(π) = m(d − 1) = n − m [GJ72, §I.6], and the lemma
is clear. Assume therefore that l ≥ 1. Let Nrd (resp., Trd) be the reduced norm (resp.,
trace) on Mm(D). For Φ ∈ S(Mm(D)) and a matrix coeﬃcient f of π let

Z(s, f, Φ) =ZG

f (g)Φ(g) |Nrd(g)|s+ n−1

Consider the functional equation

where ˆΦ is the Fourier transform of Φ given by

ˆΦ(x) =ZMm(D)

Φ(y)ψ(Trd(xy)) dy

for a suitable Haar measure on Mm(D), a non-trivial additive character ψ of F , and f ∨(g) =
f (g−1) (a matrix coeﬃcient of π∨). Take f to be a bi-Kl-invariant matrix coeﬃcient of π
such that f (1) = 1 and Φ = 1Kl. Then Z(s, f, Φ) ≡ vol(Kl) so that γGJ(s, π) is a scalar
multiple of Z(1 − s, f ∨, ˆΦ). On the other hand, if ψ has conductor OF then ˆΦ is supported
D Mm(OD) [Wei74, Ch. X, §2, Proposition 5]. Thus, Z(1 − s, f ∨, ˆΦ) is a Laurent
in ̟1−d−l

series P aixi in x = q−s such that ai = 0 for all i > m(d + l − 1). Hence, the left-hand
side of (22) is a Laurent polynomial P bixi with bi = 0 for all i > m(d + l − 1). Since

ǫGJ(s, π, ψ) = ǫGJ(0, π, ψ)xc(π), we conclude that c(π) ≤ m(d + l − 1) = n + m(l − 1), as
required.
(cid:3)

We also remark that for v ∈ S∞ we have

(23)

Λ(πv) ≪ c∞(π, r)2 ≪ Λ(πv)n.

4.2. Next consider G = GL(n1) × GL(n2) with the tensor product representation r =
Stn1 ⊗ Stn2. This L-function was studied independently by Rankin and Selberg for n1 =
n2 = 2 ([Ran40, Sel40]) and in the general case by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shalika
([JPSS79a, JPSS79b, JPSS79c, JPSS81b, JS81b, JS81a, JPSS83, JS90b, Jac09], see also
[Cog03, Cog08] and the references therein).
In particular, they showed that for π, σ
cuspidal the function

s(s − 1)LS(π)∪S(σ)(s, π × σ, r)

is an entire function of order one. Alternatively, this L-function can be also studied using
the Langlands–Shahidi method. The local factors arising from either method coincide. We
denote them by

γJPSS,Sh

(s, πv × σv, r) = ǫJPSS,Sh

v

(s, πv × σv, r)

LJPSS,Sh(1 − s, πv × σv, r∨)

LJPSS,Sh(s, πv × σv, r)

,

where again implicitly ψv are as in §2.4. These γ-factors satisfy (FE’), (ΓF) and (CL).
Thus r has property (FE+). In the non-archimedean case we set for brevity c(πv × σv) =

(πv × σv, r) (see (16)). By a result of Bushnell–Henniart [BH97] we have

c(πv × σv) ≤ n2c(πv) + n1c(σv).

(It is worthwhile to mention that this result does not depend on the Bushnell–Kutzko
classiﬁcation of supercuspidal representations [BK93], unlike the lower bound for c(πv ×
σv) proved in [BHK98].) By Lemma 4.2 we conclude that property (CC’) holds for
γJPSS,Sh
v

(s, πv × σv, r).

4.3. To ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 4.1 in the general case, we ﬁrst recall the Jacquet–
Langlands correspondence [JL70, DKV84], proved in this generality by Badulescu–Grbac
[Bad08], using results of Arthur–Clozel [AC89], with some complements in [BR10]. Let
G′ = GL(n) and let G be an inner form of G′. Then for any π ∈ Πdisc(G(A)) there exists a
unique π′ ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) such that π′
v = πv for all v where G′ splits. The representation π′
is called the Jacquet–Langlands transfer of π and will be denoted by JL(π). For any place
v we have

(25)

γGJ
v (s, πv, ψv) = γGJ

v (s, JL(π)v, ψv).

Note that it is not true in general that c(πv) = c(JL(π)v). This is related to the fact
that JL(π)v does not depend only on πv. (It is true however that πv is determined by
JL(π)v.) For instance, if π is the identity representation of G, then JL(π) is the identity
representation of G, so that c(JL(π)v) = 0 for all ﬁnite v. On the other hand, if G does
not split at v, then c(πv) > 0. However, as was pointed out after (CC’), this is immaterial
for our purposes, since (25) implies that in any case

(26)

|c(πv) − c(JL(π)v)| ≤ n.

Now let G = G1 × G2 where Gi is an inner form of G′

i = GL(ni), i = 1, 2. Let
π ∈ Πdisc(G1), σ ∈ Πdisc(G2) and let JL(π) and JL(σ) be their Jacquet–Langlands transfers
to G′

2, respectively. We have

1 and G′

(27)

LS(π)∪S(σ)(π × σ, Stn1 × Stn2) = LS(π′)∪S(σ′)(JL(π) × JL(σ), Stn1 × Stn2).

Since we do not have at our disposal an independent theory of Rankin–Selberg convolutions
for G1 × G2, we will resort to the one on G′

2. That is, we simply deﬁne

1 × G′

γJPSS,Sh ◦ JL
v

(s, π × σ, Stn1 × Stn2) = γJPSS,Sh

(s, JL(π)v × JL(σ)v, Stn1 × Stn2).

(In fact, these γ-factors depend only on πv and σv, but we do not need to use this fact.)
These factors satisfy properties (FE’) and (ΓF) by (27) and the fact that γJPSS,Sh
satisfy
(FE’) and (ΓF) for G′
follows from the corresponding
result for γJPSS,Sh
and the fact that (under a suitable identiﬁcation) JL(π)v has the same
inﬁnitesimal character as πv [BR10]. Combining (24), (26) and Lemma 4.2 (for both πv and
σv), we conclude property (CC’) for the factors γJPSS,Sh ◦ JL
. Thus, we can apply Corollary
2.11 to conclude the proof of Theorem 4.1.

5. Classical groups

We now consider the case of quasi-split classical groups, i.e. the second part of Theorem

3.11.

By a classical group we mean either a symplectic group (which is automatically split),
a special orthogonal group, or a unitary group.
In the latter case we denote by E the
quadratic extension of F pertaining to the hermitian form deﬁning the unitary group (i.e.,
the quadratic extension over which the group splits). In all other cases let E = F . The
L-group of a classical group is equipped with a natural embedding

CanG : LG → LResE/F GL(m),

where, if r is the ¯F -rank of G, then

Here, in the unitary case we have

LResE/F GL(m) ≃ (GL(m, C) × GL(m, C)) ⋊ WF ,

where WF acts on GL(m, C) × GL(m, C) via Gal(E/F ) by permuting the factors.

Let pn : L ResE/F GL(n) → GL([E : F ]n, C) be the representation given by the projection
LGL(n) → GL(n, C) if E = F , and, in the case E 6= F , by pn((x, y), e) = diag(x, y),
x, y ∈ GL(n, C), and

obtained by the composition of pnm with the “tensor product” homomorphism

L(ResE/F GL(m) × ResE/F GL(n)) → L ResE/F GL(mn).

In the case E = F , Tm,n = Stm × Stn.

Theorem 5.1. The following pairs (G, r) satisfy properties (FE+) and (CC):

(1) (E = F ), G = GL(n) × GL(1), r = ∧2 ⊗ St1, where ∧2 is the exterior square

representation.

(2) (E = F ), G = GL(n) × GL(1), r = Sym2 ⊗ St1, where Sym2 is the symmetric

square representation.

(3) (E 6= F ), G = ResE/F GL(n), and r = As± is either the Asai or the twisted Asai

representation (cf. [CPSS11]).

(4) G = G′ × ResE/F GL(n), where G′ is a quasi-split classical group and r = Tm,n ◦

(CanG′ ⊗ idn).

28

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

This theorem implies Theorem 3.11 for quasi-split classical groups by the explicit de-
scription of the representations appearing in the deﬁnition of property (L) (e.g., [Sha10,
Appendix C]). Actually, for Theorem 3.11, in the ﬁrst two parts of Theorem 5.1 it is
enough to consider the exterior square and the symmetric square representations them-
selves (without the twist), but we include the slightly more general statement since it does
not incur additional diﬃculty and the twisted representations are relevant for the GSpin
groups (cf. [AS14]). (For the Asai L-function there is no need to consider As± × St1, since
we can incorporate the twist into the representation.)

5.1.
In this subsection we consider the ﬁrst three cases of Theorem 5.1. By Lemma 2.12
and Theorem 4.1 it is enough to consider the cuspidal case. Let π ∈ Πcusp(GL(n, AE)).
By Remark 3.7, the partial L-function has ﬁnitely many poles and of order one, and local
factors γSh

v (s, π × χ, r) are deﬁned and satisfy (FE’), (ΓF) and (CL).

There are several methods to study the poles of L-functions. The results of [Grb11, GS15]
address the analytic properties of the completed L-functions. They are rather delicate and
rely on Arthur’s endoscopic classiﬁcation (extended by Mok to unitary groups). For our
purposes we only care about the partial L-functions and this can be analyzed using the
Rankin–Selberg method in a rather crude form. We summarize it in the following.

Lemma 5.2. Let π ∈ Πcusp(GL(n, AE)) and χ a Hecke character of E. Then the following
functions are entire and of ﬁnite order. (In the ﬁrst three cases E = F .)

(1) s(1 − s)LS(s, π × χ, Sym2 × St1).
(2) s(1 − s)LS(s, π × χ, ∧2 × St1), (n even).
(3) LS(s, π × χ, ∧2 × St1) (n odd).
(4) s(1 − s)LS(s, π × χ, As± × St1).

Proof. The most diﬃcult case is the twisted symmetric square, since it involves Eisenstein
series on a double cover of GL(n) (introduced in [KP84]). This case was worked out recently
by Takeda [Tak14, Tak15] who extended earlier work by Bump–Ginzburg [BG92b].2 The
other cases are easier since they involve the well-understood mirabolic Eisenstein series
on GL(n). The argument is completely standard. For completeness we include it for the
Asai L-function of a representation π ∈ Πcusp(GL(n, AE)). (The twisted Asai L-function
is obtained by twisting π.)

For any Schwartz-Bruhat function Φ ∈ S(An) let EΦ be the normalized Eisenstein series

on GL(n, F )\ GL(n, A) given by

EΦ(g, s) =ZR>0 Xξ∈F n\{0}

Φ(ξtg) |det tg|s d∗t.

2For our purposes we could have avoided this case by using Remark 2.7.

Here we embed R ֒→ F ⊗ R ֒→ A by x 7→ 1 ⊗ x. As for the Riemann zeta function, using
the Poisson summation formula we have

The Rankin–Selberg integral

ZGL(n,F )\ GL(n,AF )

ϕ(g)EΦ(g, s) dg

for a cuspidal automorphic form ϕ on GL(n, E)\ GL(n, AE) is a twisted version of the usual
integral for GL(n) × GL(n). It was considered in [Fli88]. Let Nn be the group of upper
unitriangular matrices in GL(n). Fix a non-degenerate character ψN of Nn(AE) which is
trivial on Nn(A). Let

W (g) =ZNn(E)\Nn(AE )

ϕ(ng)ψN (n) dn

be the Fourier coeﬃcient of ϕ. Assume that ϕ corresponds to a factorizable vector in

π = ⊗πv (as an abstract representation). Then we can write W (g) =Qv Wv(gv) where Wv

is in the Whittaker model of πv (with respect to ψNv ), and Wv(e) = 1 for all v /∈ S. For
Φ = ⊗Φv and Re s large, (28) unfolds to

1, Fv). Using the asymptotics of the Whittaker function (see [CS80, LM09a] for the p-
adic case, [Wal92, Ch. 15] for the archimedean case), the function Jv(Wv, ξ, s) admits a
meromorphic continuation in s. More precisely, in the non-archimedean case there exists
a polynomial Pv(x) such that for any ﬁxed Wv, Pv(q−s
v )Jv(Wv, ξ, s) is a polynomial in
q−s
v which is locally constant in ξ ∈ F n
In the archimedean case, for any real
number A there exists a polynomial Pv(s) such that Pv(s)Jv(Wv, ξ, s) is continuous in
(ξ, s) ∈ F n
v \{0}×{Re s > A} and holomorphic in s for Re s > A. Hence, Pv(s)Jv(Wv, ξ, s),
ξ ∈ F n
v \ {0})
we infer that in both the archimedean and non-archimedean cases (29) holds for all s.
Assume on the contrary that for some ﬁxed s ∈ C, Iv(s, Wv, Φv) = 0 for all Φv ∈ S(F n
v \{0})
and Wv. Varying Φv we infer that Jv(Wv, ξ, s) = 0 for all ξ. In particular,

v \ {0} is a normal family of analytic functions on Re s > A. Taking Φv ∈ S(F n

v \ {0}.

ZNn(Fv)\Pn(Fv)

Wv(p) |det p|s−1 dp = 0

for all Wv. Since we can take Wv such that its restriction to Pv(Ev) is an arbitrary
smooth left (Nv(Ev), ψv)-invariant function which is compactly supported modulo Nv(Ev)
[GK75, Jac10, Kem15] we get a contradiction.

For the twisted exterior square case one can argue in a similar way using the Jacquet–
Shalika integral representation [JS90a]. (In the even case, the pole will come from the
Eisenstein series as above.
In the odd case there is no Eisenstein series and the zeta
integral is entire.) The integral Jv in this case involves an extra unipotent integration,
but its meromorphic continuation (with the extra uniformity property mentioned above)
follows from the argument of [JS90a]. (See [Bel11] for more details.) Alternatively, one
can use the Bump-Friedberg integral [BF90] (which does not involve an extra unipotent
integration, and hence the argument above applies with little change) to infer that s2(1 −
s2)LS(s1, π, Stn)LS(s2, π × χ, ∧2 × St1) (and hence also s(1 − s)LS(s, π × χ, ∧2 × St1)) is
entire. Strictly speaking, only the case χ = 1 is considered, in [BF90] but it is a simple
matter to incorporate a non-trivial χ into the integral (and the unramiﬁed calculation is
essentially the same).

We also remark that in the case where n is odd, it easily follows from the theory of
Eisenstein series that LS(s, π ⊗ χ, ∧2 ⊗ St1) is holomorphic (see [Kim99] for a more precise
result).
(cid:3)

We turn to property (CC’). By standard properties of the Shahidi local factors we have

v (s, πv × χv, Sym2 × St1)ǫSh
ǫSh

v (s, πv × χv, ∧2 × St1) = ǫJPSS,Sh

v

(s, πv × (πv ⊗ χv)).

In particular,

eSh
v (πv × χv, Sym2 × St1) + eSh

v (πv × χv, ∧2 × St1) = eJPSS,Sh

v

(πv × πv ⊗ χv),

and by (24) we conclude that

eSh
v (πv ×χv, Sym2 × St1)+eSh

v (πv ×χv, ∧2 ×St1) ≤ n(c(πv)+c(πv ⊗χv)) ≤ 2nc(πv)+n2c(χv).

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

31

v (πv ×χv, Sym2 × St1) and eSh(πv ×χv, ∧2 ×St1) are non-negative by [Hen10] (which
Both eSh
relies on the validity of the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n)). Therefore, we infer (CC’)
for Sym2 × St1 and ∧2 × St1 from the corresponding relation for Stn.

Similarly, if v is a place of F which is inert in E and w is the place of E above v then

we may view πv as a representation πw of GL(n, Ew) and we have
(πw × πτ

v (πv, As−) = eJPSS,Sh

eSh

where τ is the Galois involution of Ew/Fv. Thus, by [Hen10]

and therefore

v (πv, As±) ≤ n(c(πw) + c(πτ

In the split case, if w1, w2 are the places of E above v (with Ew1, Ew2 ≃ Fv) and πv =
πw1 ⊗ πw2 then

v (πv, As±) = ǫSh
ǫSh

v (πw1 × πw2, Stn × Stn) ≤ n(c(πw1) + c(πw2)).

In both cases the relation (CC’) for As± follows from the case of Stn.

5.2. Next we consider the case where G = G′ ×ResE/F GL(1) and r = Tm,1 ◦(CanG′ ⊗ id1),
where G′ is a classical group and m, Tm,1 and CanG′ are as in the beginning of the section.
The L-functions in this case were studied by Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis using the doubling
method [PSR84, GPSR87, PSR86] – see also [LR05] for some complements.3 The analysis
of poles was carried out in [GPSR87, KR90] and completed by Yamana in [Yam14]. In
particular, r has property (FE+). Let γPSR
(s, π × χ, r) be the local factors conceived by
Piatetski-Shapiro–Rallis and explicated in [LR05]. They satisfy properties (FE’), (ΓF),
and (CL).

v

We now turn our attention to condition (CC’). It is tempting to try to prove it using the
deﬁnition of γPSR
(s, π × χ, r), analogously to Lemma 4.2. However, at this stage we are
unfortunately unable to carry this idea through. Instead, we will resort to a diﬀerent ap-
proach using Arthur’s work (adapted by Mok to the case of unitary groups) on functoriality
for classical groups.

v

First, we recall the following stability result.

Proposition 5.3 ([RS05, Bre08]). Let v be a non-archimedean place and π1, π2 irreducible
representations of G(Fv). In the unitary case assume that π1 and π2 have the same central
character. Then there exists a constant N = N(π1, π2) such that

We caution that unfortunately there is a mistake in [Bre08] (in both the statement and
the proof), but it is easy to ﬁx the argument to obtain the correct statement above. We
omit the details.

3See [Gan12, §7.2] for a small correction.

The argument of [RS05] explicates N(π1, π2). Moreover, by taking π2 to be a repre-
(s, π2 × χ, r) is

sentation induced from a minimal Levi subgroup of G, in which case γPSR
computed explicitly in [LR05, Theorem 4], we conclude

v

Corollary 5.4. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for any non-archimedean place
v, any irreducible representation π of G(Fv) and any character χ of E∗
v such that c(χ) >
C level(π) we have

γPSR

(s, χχ1).

Here χ1 is trivial in the symplectic and odd orthogonal cases, while in the even orthogonal
case χ1 is the Hilbert symbol with (−1)m/2D, where D is the discriminant of the quadratic
form deﬁning G (we denote this quadratic character by τD), and χ1(x) = ωπ(x/xτ ) in the
unitary case.

Now we turn to Arthur’s work on classical groups. In order to state the result that we
need, denote by Πaut(GL(n, A)) the set of irreducible representations of GL(n, A) which
are weakly contained in L2(GL(n, F )\ GL(n, A)). These are the representations which are
parabolically induced from some σ ∈ Πdisc(M(A)) where M is a Levi subgroup of GL(n).
As explained in [Art13, §1.3], by the Jacquet–Shalika classiﬁcation theorem [JS81b, JS81a]
and the Mœglin–Waldspurger description of the discrete spectrum of GL(n) [MW89], for
any ﬁnite set S of places of F , any π ∈ Πaut(GL(n, A)) is determined by the collection tπv,
v /∈ S ∪ S(π). Given π ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) and σ ∈ Πaut(GL(m, AE)), we say that σ is the
transfer of π if for any v /∈ S(π), σv is unramiﬁed and CanG′(tπv) = tσv . By the above, this
condition determines σ and its central character is given by

We will need the following consequence of Arthur’s work (taking also [Mœg09] into

Theorem 5.5 ([Art13],
Πaut(GL(m, AE)). Consequently, for any n ≥ 1 and any π′ ∈ Πcusp(GL(n, AE)) we have

[Mok15]). Any π ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) admits a transfer Ar(π) ∈

(31)

LS(σ)∪S(π′)(s, π × π′, r) = LS(σ)∪S(π′)(s, Ar(π) × π′, Tm,n).

Thanks to the work of Mœglin and others, a great deal is known about the local represen-
tations πv in terms of Ar(π). For our purposes we will only need to know the preservation
of γ-factors, namely that

γPSR(s, πv × χv, r) = γGJ(s, Ar(π)v × χv, Tm,1)

(32)
for all v and characters χv of E∗
v . If πv is unramiﬁed, this follows from the multiplicativity
properties of the γ-factors on both sides ([GJ72, LR05]). If c(χv) is suﬃciently large (with
respect to πv and Ar(π)v), then (32) follows from the stability properties of the γ-factors

([JS85] for the left-hand side and Corollary 5.4 for the right-hand side) together with the
description of the central character of Ar(π). The general case of (32) for ﬁnite v follows
from the special cases above by the argument of [Hen86, Theorem 4.1], namely, by using
(31) (for n = 1) and comparing the functional equations

for suitable Hecke characters χ (with S = S(π) ∪ S(χ)). For archimedean v one can argue
in a similar way using Lemma 2.15 (with T being the multiplicative group), replacing
Corollary 5.4 by the fact that for any s ∈ C we have

γGJ(s, Ar(π)v × |·|it , Tm,1)/γPSR(s, πv × |·|it , Tm,1) = 1.

lim
|t|→∞

Indeed, this follows from Stirling’s formula, the description of γGJ and γPSR in the archimedean
case and (30).

Finally, we prove property (CC’). By (32) it is enough to show that

(33)

c(Ar(π)v) ≪ logq level(πv)

for every ﬁnite place v. We may assume that level(πv) > 0, i.e., that πv is ramiﬁed,
since otherwise Ar(π)v is also unramiﬁed. We use Corollary 5.4 with any χv of conductor
C level(πv) + 1. We obtain

and hence by (32),

ePSR(πv × χv) ≪ logq level(πv)

c(Ar(π)v ⊗ χv) ≪ logq level(πv).

Since c(Ar(π)v) ≤ c(Ar(π)v ⊗ χv) + mc(χv) we deduce that c(Ar(π)v) ≪ logq level(πv) as
required.

We also note that by (23), and Remark 2.10 for v ∈ S∞ we have

Λ(Ar(π)v) ≪ cStm

(Ar(π)v)2 = cPSR

5.3. Finally, consider G = G′ × GL(n) where G′ is a quasi-split classical group and
r = Tm,n ◦ (CanG′ ⊗ idn). We argue as in §4.3. Namely, for π ∈ Πdisc(G′(A)) and π′ ∈

form of ResE/F GL(n).

34

TOBIAS FINIS AND EREZ LAPID

Remark 5.7. Once Arthur’s work is extended to general classical groups and their inner
forms, Theorem 3.11 will hold for them as well, with the same proof.
(The stability
argument of [RS05] should carry over to inner forms without too much trouble.) In fact,
one can hope that the methods of Arthur carry over to the GSpin groups (as well as their
inner forms). By the previous remark, once this is done, Theorem 3.11 and its proof will
extend to this case as well.

Remark 5.8. One may contemplate whether Arthur’s work (which invokes the full force
of the stable twisted trace formula) is absolutely necessary for the question at hand. A
possible diﬀerent approach would be to use the Rankin–Selberg integrals that were studied
in [GPSR97, GJRS11]. In the case of generic representations, a great deal is known about
these L-functions. In the general case, it seems that more input is necessary to address
their ﬁner analytic properties. We also mention the recent preprint [CFGK16], where a
more uniform approach for these L-functions is laid out. It is yet to be seen whether this
sheds any light on the analytic issues at hand.

Finally, the last of Theorem 3.11 follows from Theorem 4.1 (for n1 = 2, n2 = 1) and the

(G = GL(2), r = Sym3 ⊗(∧2)−1 = Sym3 ⊗(det)−1),

where Sym3 is the (four-dimensional) symmetric cube representation of GL(2), satisﬁes
properties (FE+) and (CC):

Of course, it is enough to consider π ∈ Πcusp(GL(2, A)). Once again by Remark 3.7 the
v (s, πv, r) are deﬁned and satisfy (ΓF) and (CL). The poles of LS(π)(s, π, r)
local factors γSh
(and in fact, of the completed L-function) were analyzed by Kim-Shahidi in [KS99a]. Alter-
natively, we can analyze the poles using the symmetric cube lift to GL(4), also due to Kim–
Shahidi [KS02]. Even better, using Remark 3.10 and the fact that r = St∨
2 ⊗ Sym2 − St2,
we do not need any information about the poles of LS(π)(s, π, r) (but we need to know the
existence of the symmetric square lift from GL(2) to GL(3) [GJ78] to infer that St2 ⊗ Sym2
satisﬁes (FE+)).

Finally, we prove (CC’). Combining [Sha89, Proposition 2.2] and [Sha90, Theorem 3.5]

(applied to the exceptional group G2), we have

γSh(s, π, r) = γJPSS,Sh(s, π × Sym2 π, St∨

2 × St3)/γGJ(s, π, St∨

2 ),

where Sym2 π is the symmetric square lift of π to GL(3). Thus,

eSh(π, r) ≤ c(π∨ × Sym2 π) ≤ 3c(π) + 2c(Sym2 π).

Also,

and therefore

γGJ(s, Sym2 π) = γJPSS,Sh(s, π × π)/γTate(s, ωπ),

c(Sym2) ≤ c(π × π) ≤ 4c(π).

ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF INTERTWINING OPERATORS I

We conclude that

eSh(π, r) ≤ 11c(π).

Remark 6.2. For higher rank exceptional groups, some of the L-functions on the list of
[Lan71] can be studied by Rankin–Selberg integrals, at least under a genericity assumption
(e.g., [GR00, BG92a, GH08, Gin95], to mention a few). One can also take into account
Remark 3.10 to study further cases. However, more work has to be done in order to show
that other exceptional groups satisfy properties (L) and (TWN+). We will not pursue this
matter here any further.
