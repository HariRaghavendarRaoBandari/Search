Abstract The coupled system of the spherically symmetric Einstein–Maxwell
diﬀerential equations is solved under two diﬀerent source conditions: non-zero
electric charge and pressure anisotropy. Expressions for the metric functions,
and pressures which extend the Tolman VII exact solution are deduced from
the new solutions. By applying boundary conditions to these solutions, all
integration constants are computed in terms of parameters that are physically
meaningful.

1 Introduction

The Tolman VII solution [15] is an exact analytic solution to the static and
spherically symmetric Einstein’s ﬁeld equations (EFE), with a perfect ﬂuid
matter source. This solution obeys all the criteria for physical acceptability [4,
6], and has been shown to be a viable solution that can be used for modelling
compact objects such as neutron and quark stars [13].
In this article, that solution is generalized to generate new exact solutions
with charge and/or anisotropic pressures. Since the Tolman VII solution pro-
vides a physically valid model of various physical objects, the hope behind
these generalizations is that they will lead to new models that share these
characteristics.

First a particular uncharged generalization of the Tolman VII solution is car-
ried out by introducing an anisotropic pressure. The case for anisotropic pres-
sures was made some time ago in Refs. [7,2] and since then a number of studies
into their properties have been published. Of note is the work of Letelier [10]
who elucidates the possible physical interpretations of anisotropic pressures,
and concludes that a mixture of a number of perfect ﬂuids can be transformed,
through a coordinate change, into one anisotropic ﬂuid. This aspect simpliﬁes
the physical interpretation of anisotropic pressure models, and leads one to be-
lieve that anisotropic solutions can be candidates for simple physical models
of gravitating ﬂuid spheres.

Under the assumption of pressure anisotropy, the components of the pressure,
which are assumed to be the same in all directions in a perfect ﬂuid, must
now be generalized to two diﬀerent functions, which for intuitive reasons are
usually called pr for the radial pressure component, and p⊥ for the angular
pressure component.

The further generalization carried out in this article is the introduction of
electric charge in the models. While the existence of electrically charged, large
scale physical objects are unlikely [3], on time scales much shorter than the
whole lifetime of the compact object, charge could account for non-permanent
properties such as magnetism (for example to model magnetars) in these ob-
jects.

Furthermore, as has been noted by numerous authors [8,9,16], in the static
limit, the addition of charge does not change the diﬃculty of solving the EFE,
since a “Maxwell diﬀerential equation” for the electric charge is added to the
system of equations to be solved. This can immediately be integrated and
incorporated into a global charge that is seen from the outside only through
the Reissner-Nordström external metric. The EFE’s do not change drastically
either, and a similar solution procedure to the one usually employed for the
Tolman solutions can be used to great eﬀect.

As a guide to both old and new solutions, we provide an overview in the
form of a chart in Figure 1. This chart is organized so that when moving
from left to right, one moves from solutions with isotropic pressures to those
with anisotropic pressures in the middle to solutions with both charge and
anisotropic pressures on the extreme right. This Figure uses quantities that
are explained throughout the article. Boxes that form an end point in the
decision ﬂow are solutions that are either previously known (references given)
or are new and discussed in the section indicated.

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the system of equa-
tions to be solved, and goes through the process of solving the system, while
providing physical motivations for the various assumptions required for the
solution. Section 3 concentrates on uncharged anisotropic pressures, and Sec-
tion 4 constructs new solutions which have electric charge. The last section
reviews the methods and discusses further research to be carried out on the
physical relevance of the solutions.

2 The ODE system, method of solution, and physical
considerations

2.1 The ODE system

In what follows, the metric is assumed to be spherically symmetric, static, and
expressed in the usual Schwarzschild spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, ϕ) as

ds2 = eν(r)dt2 − eλ(r)dr2 − r2dθ2 − r2 sin2 θdϕ2.

(1)

Throughout this derivation, an equivalent re-parametrization of the metric
coeﬃcients is also used, so that Z(r) = e−λ(r) and Y (r) = eν(r)/2. This re-
parametrization will allow the diﬀerential equations to be simpliﬁed and de-
pending on the type of matter considered in the following sections, the EFE
can be reduced to linear ODEs for Z(r) and Y (r).
The matter content is speciﬁed by the form of the energy momentum tensor.
The spherically symmetric ﬂuid energy–momentum tensor with anisotropic
pressure is given by

with ρ, pr and p⊥ the matter density, radial pressure, and angular pressure,
respectively.
The addition of electric charge to this system is made through the Faraday
tensor, which in the static case is given [11,3] by

deﬁned. The electromagnetic energy momentum tensor is of the form

The solution of this set of equations can be constructed in a variety of ways,
and for an extensive review, see Ref. [8]. However the aim of this article is
to ﬁnd new solutions, that can be considered to be physically relevant and
therefore we proceed with a method outlined in [15].

2.2 Solution method

First we assume a functional form for the Z metric function given by

Z(r) =: 1 − br2 + ar4.

(6)

For the moment, a and b are undetermined constants, and r is the radial
coordinate. The physical interpretation of the constants will come later in
Section 2.3.
This assumption helps in solving the system of equation (5) for Z, since the
ﬁrst order equation (5a) can immediately be integrated in terms of one integra-
tion constant. To ﬁnd the solution for Y, one ﬁrst deﬁnes a new quantity,“the
measure of anisotropy,” ∆ through subtraction of (5c) from (5b),

κ∆ = κ(pr − p⊥) =

This equation can be rearranged and simpliﬁed as a linear second order ODE
for Y, which can then be solved using a transformation of the independent
variable r.

(8)

The second order ODE has both ∆ and q as undetermined functions, which
when set to zero transforms the ODE into that for the Tolman VII solution
discussed in detail in [13]. Therefore this procedure provides a generalization
of the Tolman VII solution.
The next step in the solution is the transformation to a new variable x = r2.

(13)

Since Z is a known function of x, simpliﬁcation of the coeﬃcient multiplying
Y, is immediately possible. This reduces equation (13) into a simple linear
ODE since,

2x3(cid:19) Y = 0.

(14)

When the coeﬃcient multiplying Y is a constant, simple closed form solutions
are easily obtained. As mentioned previously, ∆ is a function that can be
arbitrarily chosen, and is interpreted as a measure of anisotropy between the
pressures in the solution. From spherical symmetry, both the radial pressure
pr and the tangential pressure p⊥ must be equal at the centre, resulting in ∆
having to be equal to zero when x = r2 = 0. Similarly the enclosed charge q
can be given arbitrarily. In order to be physically relevant q must be regular
everywhere including at the origin where r = 0.

2.3 Physical considerations

Following [13], where a straightforward interpretation of the Tolman VII solu-
tion in terms of physical parameters of the star was given, a physical motivation
for the diﬀerent functions in the equation (14) above is sought. This section
can be seen as the motivation for choosing the radial dependence for ∆ and q.
Considering that in the Tolman VII solution, the ansatz for Z allows the inte-
gration of equation (5a) directly, proceeding in a similar fashion here simpliﬁes
the ODE (5a), with the caveat that now there is a contribution from the charge
q.
However, in general relativity, the electric charge has mass–energy, and fol-
lowing Ivanov [8] the external perceived mass is redeﬁned as the sum of the
material rest mass, and the electrostatic energy contained in the electrostatic
ﬁeld, so that

M = 4πZ rb

0 (cid:18)ρ(r) +

q2(r)

8πr4(cid:19) r2 dr.

(15)

This redeﬁnition of mass then results in the integration of equation (5a) as
follows, since Z has already an assumed form,

M = 4πZ rb

0 (cid:18)1 − Z − r

dZ

dr(cid:19) dr = 4πZ rb

0

(3br2 − 5ar4) dr.

(16)

Self-gravitating charged ﬂuid spheres with anisotropic pressures

7

This mass equation leads to a physical interpretation for the constants a and b.
Since the Tolman VII solution has physical characteristics, and is compatible
with the form of Z chosen, one assumes the same form in all of the future so-
lutions. The physical reasoning motivating this choice is given in detail in [13],
where a quadratic density proﬁle of the form

ρ = ρc"1 − µ(cid:18) r

rb(cid:19)2# ,

leads to a metric function Z becomes

(17)

(18)

Z(r) = 1 −(cid:16) κρc

3 (cid:17) r2 +(cid:18) κµρc

b (cid:19) r4 = 1 − br2 + ar4.

5r2

Thus a and b can be identiﬁed with the parameters in parentheses. In (17), the
constant rb represents the boundary radius at the matter-vacuum interface,
and ρc represents the central density at r = 0. Finally µ is a dimensionless
“self-boundedness” parameter where 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1. When µ = 0, one has a sphere
of constant density, and when µ = 1, a “natural” star, with density vanish-
ing at the boundary is obtained. For intermediate values there is a density
discontinuity at rb which decreases in magnitude with increasing µ.
This same property shall be used once again in Section 3, where an anisotropic
pressure only is considered. For the case with charge a more general approach
will be taken.
The charge distribution will be assumed to take the form q(r) = krn, where
k is a constant and n > 0. Such charge distributions occur in many static
situations, for mathematical reasons (see [8] for example) but they can be
expected to exist on physical grounds as well.
First all known charge carriers are massive. Therefore they will also undergo
gravitational attraction. In addition the static electromagnetic ﬁeld energy
density is positive since it is proportional to q2 which then also contributes to
the attractive gravitational force. On the other hand it is known that in the
absence of any other forces all free charges reside on the surface of a conducting
medium.
It can therefore be expected that when gravitational and electromagnetic forces
are closed to being balanced, the strength of the electromagnetic repulsion will
tend to concentrate charge in the outer regions of a compact ﬂuid body, while
maintaining a non-zero charge density inside the body.
The fact that pressure terms are introduced due to non-gravitational, non-
electromagnetic interactions helps provide more realistic charge distributions
than are found in charged dust solutions for example.
From the above discussion the initial ansatz for Z from equation (6) can be
substituted into the RHS of the ﬁrst ODE (5a), which results in

κρ +

q2
r4 = 3b − 5ar2.

(19)

Consistency, and the desire to keep the procedure for solving this system of
equations the same as outlined in Section 2.2 then demands that the LHS of the

8

Ambrish M. Raghoonundun, David W. Hobill

equation (19) also be a quadratic function with vanishing linear term. Because
of the structure of this equation one is forced to choose either q(r) = kr2, in
which case,

3b − 5ar2 = (κρc + k2) −

or q(r) = kr3, which results in

κρcµ

r2
b

r2,

3b − 5ar2 = κρc −(cid:18) κρcµ

b − k2(cid:19) r2.

r2

Therefore the charge introduces terms that redeﬁne the parameters a and b,
in terms of physical parameters ρc, µ, rb and k. However, it is found that the
choice q(r) = kr2 yields a diﬀerential equation for Y (r) that is not soluble
with elementary functions1. Discarding the quadratic radial dependence, the
choice q(r) = kr3 is selected for the remainder of this article.
Turning to the “measure of anisotropy” ∆(r), one has to satisfy the condition
that the metric is spherically symmetric. Both pressures must be equal at
the coordinate centre, r = 0 if spherical symmetry is to be satisﬁed, and this
can be translated into ∆(0) = 0. Except for this condition, there is complete
arbitrariness in specifying the anisotropy, and indeed the literature is replete
with diﬀerent ansätze for ∆. For the purely mathematical reason of solving
equation (14) the choice we make is ∆ = βx = βr2. This choice satisﬁes the
condition at the centre, and leads to a constant value for the coeﬃcient of Y
appearing equation (14).
With these two assumptions about the anisotropy and charge, the ODE for Y
becomes

d2Y
dξ2 = −

Y

4 (cid:0)a + β − 2k2(cid:1) = −Φ2Y.

(20)

Diﬀerent solutions can be generated from diﬀerent assumptions about Φ2, β or
k, and a classiﬁcation that summarizes these choices is provided in Figure 1.
Those in the lightly shaded boxes are the ones that will be discussed in this
article.

2.4 Boundary conditions

The constants of integration associated with each solution will be determined
by the boundary conditions (BCs) that one speciﬁes. The system of equations
consists of one ﬁrst order ODE for Z, and one second order ODE for Y. The
ﬁrst one makes use of the deﬁnition of mass in equation (15). For the second
one, we require two BCs, and the junction conditions matching the interior
metric to the exterior metric provide the two needed BCs.

1 The coeﬃcient of Y in the second order ODE after variable changes still contains a
1/r2 term, turning the problem into a variable coeﬃcient one. Once additional assumptions
about a have been made, a solution in terms of hypergeometric functions is possible, but
the assumption about a renders the solution physically uninteresting.

The second boundary condition (22b) can also be implemented once the so-

radial pressure pr solely in terms of the metric and metric derivatives that
make applying the ﬁrst boundary condition easier. The ﬁrst step in generating
this expression is the addition of equations (5a) and (5a) to obtain

2.5 New Solutions

The spherically symmetric Einstein–Maxwell interior ﬁeld equations can now
be solved completely since a distinct ODE whose solutions are available has
been presented, and furthermore, one can interpret all the constants present in
the solutions physically. The availability of boundary conditions ensures the
uniqueness of the solution. Based on Figure 1 the ODE for Y for diﬀerent
physical conditions will be discussed in the following sections.

is investigated. As a result, this equation becomes

The solutions can immediately be written in terms of the parameter φ2 =
Φ2(k = 0) = (a + β)/4 in the following table. The details of the properties
associated with the diﬀerent solutions are discussed in the sections indicated
in Table 1.

3.1 The φ2 = 0 case

When φ2 = 0, the only possibility is for β = −a = − κµρc
, which is either
negative when all the parameters in the κµρc
expression are positive deﬁnite:

the case we will consider now, or zero when the parameter µ = 0. The latter
case reduces to the Schwarzschild interior solution for which there is much
historical [14,18] and contemporary literature [17,5]. For the β 6= 0 case, p⊥ =
pr − ∆ = pr + ax, and the angular pressure is thus larger than the radial
pressure everywhere but at the centre. Applying the two boundary conditions
to solve for the integration constants, equation (24) yields

and similarly the tangential pressure is easily written in terms of the above as

(30)

This completes the solution, since all the metric functions and matter variables
have been found in terms of the parameters in the ansatz and the radial
coordinate r. If an equation of state for this solution is required, one could
invert the density relation (17), to get an expression for r in terms of ρ, such

that r = rbp(1 − ρ/ρc)/µ . Simple substitution in the expressions for the
pressures (29) and (30) will then give the equation of state for both pressures
pt(ρ), and p⊥(ρ), in a process similar to what was done in Ref [13].

3.2 The φ2 > 0 case

When φ2 > 0, a + β > 0, which implies that β > −a. Since a has a speciﬁc
dependence on the parameters ρc, µ, and rb, one obtains β > − κµρc
, which

5r2
b

allows β to have negative values, since the fraction in the last expression is
positive deﬁnite. Y is then given in terms of the trigonometric functions given
in Table 1, from which one can write expressions for the derivative of dY
dξ
by direct computation. Applying this boundary condition leads to the follow-
ing relation among the constants of integration and the free parameters that
describe the solution:

Furthermore the boundary condition applied to Y leads to:

dY

= φ [c2 cos (φξb) − c1 sin (φξb)] = α :=

dξ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ξ=ξb

and

sion of the density–radial coordinate relation generates an equation of state,
if required.

3.3 The φ2 < 0 case

When φ2 < 0, a + β < 0, which implies that β < −a. Again using the explicit
expression for a, β < − κµρc
, which forces β to have negative values, since
the fraction in the last expression is positive deﬁnite. The expression for the

= φ [c2 cosh (φξb) + c1 sinh (φξb)] = α,

Y |ξ=ξb

= γ ⇒ c2 sinh (φξb) + c1 cosh (φξb) = γ.

These two equations provide explicit expressions for the integration constants,

(36)

As with the previous examples, an explicit equation of state can be obtained
from inverting equation (17) to obtain r(ρ).
In the next section charged generalizations of solutions with anisotropic pres-
sures will be discussed.

4 Charged case with anisotropic pressures

In this section electrically charged solutions with q = kr3 6= 0 are investigated.
The simplest case sets β = 0, which eliminates the anisotropic pressure. This
results in

4Φ2 = a − 2k2.

Setting k = 0 leads to the Tolman VII solution as expected. The general case
with k 6= 0 yields the solution given by Kyle and Martin [9].
Now consider the ∆ 6= 0, case instead. Requiring that ∆
x3 eﬀectively
“anisotropises” the electric charge allowing the latter to contribute to the
anisotropy only, and considerably simpliﬁes the solution to Y. This solution
is examined in Section 4.1. If instead ∆ = βx, and 2q2 = 2k2x3, one gets
4Φ2 = a + β − 2k2, which allows an analysis very similar to what was done in
the previous Sections since Φ2 can then be of either sign. This possibility is
investigated in Sections 4.2 to 4.4

x = 2q2

4.1 “Anisotropised charge”

In this section solutions to the EMS where the electric charge and anisotropic
pressure are related to each other through the relation ∆ = 2(q/x)2, are dis-
cussed. From the arguments in Section (2.3), q = kr3. This particular choice
simpliﬁes the diﬀerential equation for the Y metric function allowing for a
solution analogous to the Tolman VII solution for Y to be written in the form

Y (ξ) = c1 cos (Φξ) + c2 sin (Φξ), with Φ =r a

4

.

(37)

However this solution is fundamentally diﬀerent from the Tolman VII solution
which was a solution to the Einstein’s system of equation and not the Einstein–
Maxwell system. There are a number of reasons for this:

18

Ambrish M. Raghoonundun, David W. Hobill

1. The charge in this system is non-zero, unlike the Tolman VII solution,

where Q = 0.

2. The presence of the anisotropic pressure in the solution means that p⊥ is

not the same as the radial pressure pr. This is clear since ∆ 6= 0.
3. Also, this solution will have to be matched to the Reissner-Nordström
metric outside the sphere, as opposed to the Schwarzschild solution for the
Tolman VII solution.

If these conditions are implemented, a fully-ﬂedged new solution to the EMS
can be obtained. Applying the boundary conditions (24) and (25), at the
vacuum–matter interface leads to:

– The condition on the derivative

= Φ [c2 cos (Φξb) − c1 sin (Φξb)] = α,

dY

dξ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ξ=ξb

which can be rearranged to yield an equation for c1 and c2 in terms of
previously deﬁned constants: c2 cos(Φξ) − c1 sin(Φξ) = α/Φ and

– The second condition on the function Y :

Y (rb) = c1 cos (Φξb) + c2 sin (Φξb) = γ,

Together this pair of equations can be solved for c1 and c2 to give

c2 = γ sin (Φξb) +

c1 = γ cos (Φξb) −

α
Φ

Φ

sin (Φξb),

Figure 5 which plots the metric functions demonstrates the eﬀects of the pa-
rameter k which measures the magnitude of the electrostatic charge. For large
values of k the behaviour of the metric functions deviates signiﬁcantly from
the k = 0 cases studied in Section 3
The complete solution where the anisotropic pressures and the charge com-
pensate for each other thus becomes

which completes the solution. As can be seen the solution could be expressed
in terms of q, or ∆ exclusively, since these two functions are not independent
in this particular solution. As with the previous examples, an explicit equation
of state could be obtained since it requires a straightforward inversion of the
density function’s dependence on r. The total mass and charge of the object

20

these equations simplify to

σ(r) =

(42)

4πpZ(r)

This completes the solution for this case. Turning to the case where both
charge and anisotropic pressure exist independently of each other, requires
a thorough analysis of the diﬀerent combinations of charge and anisotropic
pressure, and how these conspire to change the character of the diﬀerential
equation.

4.2 The Φ2 = 0 case

If Φ2 = 0 in equation (20), then 2k2 = a + β, and the solution for Y is simply
Y = c1 + c2ξ, with c1 and c2 constants of integration. Applying boundary
conditions on this solution then results in

and

which can be solved together algebraically to give the value of c1. This com-
pletes the solution for Y in this particular case.
The Z metric function is still ﬁxed by the Tolman assumption: Z = 1 − br2 +
ar4. In this particular case a and b are given by:

a =

and b =

Given the relation a+β = 2k, only two parameters are arbitrary to completely
specify the solution, and here, β is chosen in preference to k. This feature, and
the consistent matching of the boundaries is shown in Figure 6.

parameter values are chosen to mimic the values these parameters would have
had in compact real stars.

Once the two metric functions are found, all other quantities are determined,
in particular the radial pressure pr is given by

pr =

4.3 The Φ2 < 0 case

Here (a + β − 2k2)/4 < 0, and the solutions for Y can be written in the form

Y = c1 cosh (Φξ) + c2 sinh (Φξ).

In this particular case, one will not have a simpliﬁcation wherein the charge
could be compensated completely by the anisotropic pressure or mass, and one
is then forced to deal with all three contributions. In this case 2k2 > a + β,
and this leads to the belief that such a solution has very little chance of being
physical, since the charge contribution dominates the mass and pressure.
Applying boundary conditions to this solution to obtain the values of the
constants c1 and c2 through the same procedure as previously, leads to

dY

dξ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ξ=ξb

and

= Φ [c2 cosh (Φξb) + c1 sinh (Φξb)] = α,

Y (ξb) = c2 sinh (Φξb) + c1 cosh (Φξb) = γ.

Then using a procedure very similar to that of previous sections, the integra-
tion constants can be computed as

c2 =

α
Φ

c1 = γ cosh (Φξb) −

cosh (Φξb) − γ sinh (Φξb),
sinh (Φξb)

α
Φ

(43)

(44)

We show the solutions up to the boundary r = rb in Figure 7, and note that in
this case we need both β and k to completely specify one particular solution.

4.4 The Φ2 > 0 case

This implies (a + β − 2k2)/4 > 0, and now the solutions are given by

Y = c1 cos (Φξ) + c2 sin (Φξ).

As in the previous case, the simpliﬁcation wherein the charge could be com-
pensated completely by the anisotropic pressure or mass, does not happen,
and one is forced to deal with all three parameters. However the charge contri-
bution will be less than the mass and pressure anisotropy contribution (since
2k2 < a+β,) therefore this would seem to be the most promising candidate for
a new physically relevant solution. Investigating this solution and the remain-
ing ones, in detail will allow conclusions about viability as a physical solution
to be drawn.
Applying boundary conditions to this solution the values of the constants c1
and c2 are obtained.

Fig. 8: Application of the boundary conditions that match the value and radial
derivative of the metric function at r = rb for Φ2 < 0. The parameter values
are ρc = 1 × 1018 kg · m−3, rb = 1 × 104 m and µ = 1, and were chosen to
mimic the values in compact objects

5 Conclusions

Beginning with the Tolman VII ansatz that Z = 1 − br2 + ar4, together with
the addition of electric charge and anisotropic pressures, it has been shown
that a number of new solutions to the Einstein–Maxwell system of equations
can be constructed. In addition these solutions are all regular in the radial
coordinate r. The crucial step in constructing the new solutions is ﬁnding the
function Y (r), since the ODE leading to its solution is initially non-linear and
second order.
The choices stemming from requiring a physical solution determine the radial
dependence of Z and q. The functional form of Z is chosen so that the inte-
gral of Z−1/2(x) can be computed analytically, and based on the Tolman VII
solution, the mass density ρ generated by this assumption can be physically
motivated. The form for q, as was argued in Section 2.3 was chosen to be in
line with the assumption for Z, since any other choice would render the second
order ODE [8] for Y to be in the form

Indeed one can only realistically modify the choice of the anisotropic pressure
in order to generate a new function. The crucial step in constructing solutions

stems from equation (20), which can then be converted by judicious choices to
a situation where the second derivative of Y with respect to ξ is proportional
to Y. The restriction of the radial dependence for the charge q to be a cubic
function leads to an ODE for Y in the form:

after the transformation to the ξ radial variable as discussed in Section 2.
Of course when pursuing uncharged solutions k (and q), vanish. Then simple
solutions can be obtained by an appropriate choice of ∆. However, if charged
solutions are required, modifying the terms in brackets in such a way as to
keep a simple form for the Y ODE, appears to be the best way to proceed.
The application of boundary conditions on the metric functions Y and Z com-
pleted the closed form solutions in terms of parameters that can be physically
interpreted. Expressions for the matter variables: the density ρ, the pressures
pr and p⊥, the electric charge Q, and the mass M for the models were also
speciﬁed. Issues such as the stability of the solutions to radial perturbations
and/or the regularity of the matter variables have been investigated in [12] and
will be published subsequently. The goal here is to provide a simple method
of generating some solutions to the EMS that begin with physically motivated
ansätze. Following a similar analysis given in [13] the expectation is that some
of these solutions may lead to exact analytic models of realistic compact stars.
This article should be regarded as the mathematical component of solution
ﬁnding, and model building for the solutions. The physical description of com-
pact objects described by these solutions will be forthcoming.
