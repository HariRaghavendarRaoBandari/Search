The availability of compact, low-cost magnetic resonance imaging instruments would further
broaden the substantial impact of this technology. We report highly sensitive detection of mag-
netic resonance using low-stress silicon nitride (SiNx) membranes. We use these membranes as
low-loss, high-frequency mechanical oscillators and ﬁnd they are able to mechanically detect spin-
dependent forces with high sensitivity enabling ultrasensitive magnetic resonance detection. The
high force detection sensitivity stems from their high mechanical quality factor Q ∼ 106 [1, 2] com-
bined with the low mass of the resonator. We use this excellent mechanical force sensitivity to detect
√
the electron spin magnetic resonance using a SiNx membrane as a force detector. The demonstrated
Hz, indicating a potential low temperature (4 K) sensitivity
force sensitivity at 300 K is 4 fN/
Hz. Given their sensitivity, robust construction, large surface area and low cost, SiNx
of 25 aN/
membranes can potentially serve as the central component of a compact room-temperature ESR
and NMR instrument that has superior spatial resolution to conventional approaches.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic resonance is a powerful tool that has revo-
lutionized the ﬁelds of medicine, chemistry, and physics.
Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) apparatuses utilize tech-
nology that have beneﬁted from six decades of develop-
ment, but still they have their limitations: the cost and
size of NMR apparatuses are barriers that limit acces-
sibility to the technology, and the spatial resolution of
MRI is at best a few microns [3–6]. A design that is
less expensive, more compact, and has superior resolu-
tion to conventional NMR/MRI would be a signiﬁcant
achievement that could enable a wide variety of new ap-
plications.

Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) is a
technique based on mechanical detection of magnetic
resonance signals.
It has demonstrated imaging reso-
lution far beyond that of conventional inductive-based
MRI, achieving nuclear-spin resolution better than ten
nanometers [7, 8]. The central component of MRFM is a
mechanical resonator with high force sensitivity. The res-
onator is used to measure the force of interaction between
the sample containing electron or nuclear spins, and a
probe magnet with a strong ﬁeld gradient. Depending
on the experimental conﬁguration, either the sample or
the probe magnet is placed directly on the resonator [7, 9]
while the other component is in a ﬁxed position in close
proximity. The force of the probe-sample interaction is
measured by detecting the displacement of the resonator
via optical interferometry. Thermal force noise as low
as 0.82 aN/
Hz was achieved [10] using MRFM, culmi-
nating in an experiment that demonstrated single elec-
tron spin detection [9]. At present such a high sensitiv-
ity has been achieved by using ultrasoft cantilevers with

√

∗ Hammel@physics.osu.edu

spring constants k as low as 110 µN/m [9]. While such
cantilevers deliver exceptional force sensitivity, their use
presents challenges: they are very fragile, sample prepa-
ration in the sample-on-cantilever geometry is diﬃcult
due to its small size, and such cantilevers are not com-
mercially available.

Here we demonstrate that SiNx membranes present
a viable alternative to ultrasoft cantilevers as a sensi-
tive force detectors for MRFM applications. Such mem-
branes exhibit a number of attractive properties includ-
ing high sensitivity, robust mechanical properties, com-
√
mercial availability, low cost, and a large surface area.
The force noise of membranes can be as low as 8 aN/
Hz
[2], which is within an order of magnitude of the highest
sensitivity demonstrated so far for an ultrasoft cantilever
[10]. While less sensitive, the membrane is much less
fragile because it is surrounded on all sides, unlike a can-
tilever supported only at one end. As a result, unlike
the ultrasoft cantilever, the membrane is much less sus-
ceptible to bending and twisting which otherwise can be
detrimental for interferometric displacement detection.
Samples can be quickly prepared on membranes utiliz-
ing similar sample preparation techniques as transmis-
sion electron microscopy (TEM), including application
to the membrane by micropipette, or immersion in ﬂuid
on a glass slide. Finally, with their large surface area,
membranes can accommodate a wider range of sample
sizes and provide a larger target for interferometry than
ultrasoft cantilevers.

One further advantage of membranes is their high nat-
ural frequency. The fundamental frequency of mem-
branes can be in the MHz range, which enables resolving
faster spin dynamics, and opens the door to new exper-
iments. For example, since the Larmor frequency of nu-
clear spins in low ﬁeld is also in the MHz range, there
is the possibility of matching the membrane’s mechani-
cal resonance with the spins nuclear magnetic resonance
frequency. This matching could overcome the current re-
striction to measuring only the z-component of the mag-

netization and allow force detection of its transverse com-
ponent. This enticing possibility would provide MRFM
access to the powerful array of imaging tools developed
for pulsed NMR. Transverse detection of Larmor preces-
sion, known as direct-detection or “spin precession imag-
ing” [11, 12], could furthermore be accomplished without
the necessity of an RF-generator. As the membrane os-
cillates, the spin sample on the membrane is physically
displaced in the presence of a strong ﬁeld gradient, which
naturally generates the large oscillating magnetic ﬁeld
needed to excite the magnetic resonance signal. This in-
novation would aid in simplifying the MRFM apparatus.
The apparatus could thus be reduced to three main com-
ponents: a membrane, optical ﬁber-based displacement
detection, and a magnetic particle on a translation stage.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental details and setup

The MRFM experiment is performed by creating an
oscillating force on a sample placed in the center of the
membrane. The oscillating force is generated by mod-
ulating the sample magnetization using magnetic reso-
nance, in the presence of a ﬁeld gradient. The force drives
the membrane at its natural frequency to an amplitude
A = F Q/k, where F is the force, k is the spring constant,
and Q is the quality factor of the membrane. We use the
cyclic-saturation resonance protocol [13, 14] to measure
a small particle of diphenyl picrahydrazyl (DPPH) on a
membrane. DPPH is a well-known organic molecule that
exhibits a strong electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
signal.

The magnetic resonance signal is detected by measur-
ing the displacement of a SiNx membrane by means of
a ﬁber optic interferometer, aligned as shown in ﬁgure
1. The interferometer uses 1550 nm laser light and is
focused down to a 10 µm spot adjacent to the DPPH
particle. The optical power incident on the membrane
was about 80 µW. A 2.5 turn, 350 µm diameter cop-
per resonance coil generates B1, the the RF ﬁeld. The
coil is centered on the membrane and is stub-tuned to
a frequency ω0/2π = 3.010 GHz , setting the magnetic
resonance condition of ω0/γ = 1070 G, where γ is the
electron gyromagnetic ratio. With an input power of
100 mW, the coil produces B1 = 4.7 G. On the oppo-
site side of the membrane, a two-axis piezoelectric stage
(attocubes [15]) positions a rectangular NeFeB magnet,
which provides both the polarizing magnetic ﬁeld (B0)
and a ﬁeld gradient of G = 0.2 G/µm. The instrument
operates at a pressure of 10−6 torr.

Using the coordinate system in ﬁgure 1, the force on
dBz
the electrons in the DPPH is given by F = µz
dx , where
µz = MzV , and V is the volume of the DPPH particle.

experimental setup. From the left, the interferometer laser
passes through the copper coil and is incident on the mem-
brane. A 20 µm particle of DPPH is placed in the center of the
membrane. A permanent magnet produces both the polariz-
ing ﬁeld B0 and a magnetic ﬁeld gradient, which generates
a force on the electron spins in the DPPH. (b) Photomicro-

bare membrane exhibits a frequency of 1.35 MHz, and the
loaded membrane exhibits a frequency of 644 kHz.

the magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction generated by the
permanent magnet, χ0 = 2.5 × 10−5 is the susceptibility
of DPPH, µ0 is the permeability of vacuum, τ = 62 ns
is the spin relaxation time, and γ
2π = 28 GHz/T is the
electron gyromagnetic ratio. To create the oscillating
force, we induce an oscillating moment at the membrane
frequency by modulating the frequency ω of B1 such that
ω(t) = ω0 + Ω sin (2πfct). This results in a time-varying
magnetization Mz(t) whose Fourier component M1 at the
membrane frequency given by M1 = Ω ∂Mz
∂ω [13]. The
derivative leads to a bipolar line shape of the force as a
function of B0.

The magnetic resonance signal is measured by vary-
ing the position of the permanent magnet and hence the
magnitude of the applied magnetic ﬁeld experienced by
the sample on the membrane. The region of the magnet’s
ﬁeld where the resonance condition is satisﬁed (B = 1070
G) is referred to as the “resonant slice,” the thickness of

abMembraneCoilMagnetInterferometerLinear positioner(attocubes)xyzwhich is ∆B/G = 50 µm, where ∆B = 10 G is the
linewidth of DPPH. Due to the gradient, each spin in
the resonant slice experiences a slightly diﬀerent ﬁeld, so
the force as a function of magnet position is an integral
as described in reference [14]; see the appendix.

B. Force noise

The central component of the MRFM apparatus is a
sensitive mechanical oscillator which is employed as a
force detector whose force sensitivity is limited by ther-
mal force noise SF given by

such as thickness, side length, tensile stress, and density;
t, L, σ, and ρ, respectively. The frequency is given by

where in the last step we further simpliﬁed the expression
using the experimentally observed relation [1] that qual-
ity factor goes as Q ∼ (L/t)2 for L/t < 105. Equation
(3) shows that to minimize the thermal force noise, it is
desirable to have a low stress, low density material, large
side length, and most critically, a very thin membrane.
To this end, we use a 30 nm thick, 0.25 mm side length
membrane for our experiments (L/t = 8 × 103). The
membranes we used are made of low-stress SiNx from
the manufacturer Structure Probe Inc. (SPI) [17], and
exhibit a natural frequency of 1.35 MHz. Given the den-
sity of low-stress silicon nitride, ρ = 3.1 g/cm3, this cor-
responds to a stress of σ = 654 MPa, and a spring con-
stant of k = 97 N/m. After attaching a DPPH particle
to the center of the membrane with epoxy, the frequency
of the membrane decreased to roughly 644 kHz. This
corresponds to an increase in mass of 4.65× 10−12 kg, or
a particle diameter of 19 µm, consistent with the optical
image of the membrane particle in ﬁgure 1b.

k = 7.4 pm.

We perform ringdown measurements (ﬁgure 2b) to ex-
tract the membrane’s quality factor by driving the mem-
brane, ceasing the drive, then measuring the amplitude
decay with a lock-in ampliﬁer. We ﬁt the amplitude de-
cay to an exponential, Ae− t
τ , and use Q = πf0τ to ex-
tract Q. The bare membrane exhibited a quality factor
of 2.4 × 105 at room temperature, which increased to
4.2 × 106 upon cooling the system to low temperature.
The impressively large Q at low temperature (4 K) is
in agreement with other measurements [1, 2]. Loading
the membrane with the DPPH particle signiﬁcantly re-
duced the quality factor to Q = 2.7 × 104. Using these
√
quality factors, equation (2) yields a thermal force noise
of 4 fN/
Hz for
the bare membrane at low temperature. While we have
found that adding a large particle will drastically reduce
the quality factor of the membrane, thereby making the
membrane less sensitive, we have also placed particles on
the membrane ( 1 µm) small enough that they did not
aﬀect the quality factor.

Using a piezoelectric element we can sinusoidally drive
the membrane to large amplitudes as shown in ﬁgure 2c.
Due to a cubic term in the spring response of the mem-
brane, F = kx+βx3, the equation of motion is non-linear
0 + βx3 = F0 sin ωt [20],
and is given by ¨x +
where β is a parameter that describes the strength of
the nonlinearity. This results in the well-known Duﬃng-
oscillator response that is a deviation from the Lorentzian
response of a linear oscillator. The shape of the signal
can be understood in that the membrane eﬀectively be-
comes stiﬀer for large amplitudes of oscillation, which
causes an increase in the natural frequency of the mem-
brane. The non-linearity also causes hysteresis such that
driving from below resonance to above resonance yields
a diﬀerent response than sweeping from above resonance
to below resonance. While it is possible to apply feed-
back to cancel the Duﬃng non-linearity [21], we instead
work at suﬃciently low amplitudes that our experiment
is performed in the linear regime.

We measure the displacement of the membrane using
a ﬁber-optic interferometer and we ﬁt the thermal peak

As the bare membrane is cooled to cryogenic tempera-
tures (ﬁgure 2d), we observe that the frequency decreases

membrane at 300 K, and (3) DPPH-loaded membrane at 300 K. We ﬁnd that cryogenic temperatures increase the quality factor
of the membrane by over an order of magnitude, from 2.4 × 105 to 4.2 × 106. On the other hand, loading the membrane with
a particle of DPPH drastically reduces the quality factor down to 2.7 × 104. (c) Driving the membrane to large amplitudes
shows the well-known Duﬃng-oscillator response, which results from a cubic term in addition to the linear term in the spring
constant. The non-linearity results in an increase in resonance frequency for large drive amplitudes, as well as causing the sharp
discontinuities, and the hysteresis in scanning forward or reverse. (d) The membranes frequency as a function of temperature.
This non-monotonic behavior is likely related to the diﬀerential thermal expansion coeﬃcient between the silicon nitride thin
ﬁlm and the silicon substrate [18, 19].

for temperatures between 300 K and 130 K, then in-
creases between 130 K and 4 K. We attribute this non-
monotonic behavior to the diﬀerential coeﬃcient of ther-
mal expansion between the SiNx thin ﬁlms and the sili-
con substrate [18, 19]. For high temperature SiNx thin
ﬁlm deposition on silicon, the coeﬃcient of thermal ex-
pansion for silicon is greater than that of SiNx which
results in a decrease in the stress of the membrane as it
cools, and correspondingly the frequency decreases. As
the temperature continues to decrease past 130 K the co-
eﬃcients cross, reversing the eﬀect: the stress increases,
and membrane frequency increases.

III. RESULTS

nance signal as a function of microwave power. The ex-
perimental parameters are ω0/2π = 3.010 GHz, Ω/2π =
10 MHz, T = 300 K. We take multiple measurements at
each point, and use more averaging for smaller powers.
We ﬁt each curve with equation (5) (appendix) and ex-
tract the peak forces, which are shown in the inset. The
magnetic force drives the membrane to a maximum vi-
bration amplitude of 0.4 angstroms as shown on the right

is provided for reference.The second harmonic and third har-
monic spin signals are the green and blue curves respectively.
Second and third harmonic measurements are performed by
modulating the microwave frequency at half and one third the
membrane frequency, respectively, while monitoring the mem-
brane amplitude at the membranes natural frequency. The
ﬁrst, second, and third harmonic signals are proportional to
the ﬁrst, second, and third derivatives of the magnetization,
respectively.

G/µm, and the force corresponds to a polarized moment
of µz = 10−14 J/T, or 109 electron spins.

IV. DISCUSSION

We also measure higher harmonic spin signals (ﬁgure 4)
which have been shown to reduce spurious noise [13], and
provide additional conﬁrmation of the origin of the signal.
Due to the nonlinearity of equation 1 with respect to RF
modulation, magnetic resonance signals are generated
not just at the modulation frequency ωm, but also at inte-
ger multiples: 2ωm, 3ωm, etc. We measure these higher
harmonic signals by setting the microwave modulation
rate at half the membranes frequency ωm = (2πfc)/2, or
one-third, etc., resulting in a signal at the membranes fre-
quency which we detect. The ﬁrst three harmonic signals
∂3Mz
are given by M1 = Ω ∂Mz
∂ω3 ;
each additional harmonic is one higher derivative. For
modulation at the membrane frequency and 32 mW of
microwave power, spurious coupling appears as a con-
stant oscillation amplitude oﬀset of 0.1 ˚A in our in-phase
lock-in channel, on top of which rides the 0.3 ˚A spin sig-
nal. We subtract this background from the data in ﬁgure
3. In contrast, spurious coupling is nearly eliminated us-
ing modulation away from the membranes frequency, and
no background subtraction is necessary in ﬁgure 4.

We now address the potential for detection of nuclear
spins with membranes. Detection of nuclear moments is
more diﬃcult than detecting electrons for two reasons:
(1) The moment of nuclear spins is much smaller than
that of electrons, and (2) a very large (¿ 100 G) B1 is
needed to adiabatically invert nuclear spins at the mem-
brane frequency.

The minimum number of spins n that can be measured
using cyclic saturation is set by Curie’s law and the ther-

is the detection bandwidth. Given that the electron has a
moment 660 times larger than that of a nuclear spin such
as a proton, it is readily seen that a signiﬁcantly smaller
number of electron spins are required to achieve the same
signal as nuclear spins. For our membrane under the con-
ditions presented in this paper, the minimum number of
total protons we would be able to detect at room tem-
perature is 5.5 × 1016 protons, corresponding to a voxel
size of 475 µm (assuming a spin density of 5.1 × 1028

frequency modulation. The MRFM signal grows linearly
with Ω, so it cannot be made arbitrarily small. Since
the frequency of the membrane is very large, this means
that a very large B1 is required, over 100 G. Nichol et.
al used a 240 nm wide, 100 nm thick constriction in a
silver wire to achieve a B1 of 88 G for MRFM detection
[8, 21]; however, achieving such high B1 is experimentally
challenging. Such constrictions are diﬃcult to fabricate,
they are very sensitive to electrostatic disharge, and the
sample must be brought very close to the constriction (80
nm).

V. CONCLUSION

We have provided the ﬁrst demonstration of magnetic
resonance force microscopy using a membrane resonator.
We measured the signal from a 20 µm DPPH particle
√
placed on a membrane. The membrane exhibited a room
√
temperature sensitivity of 4 fN/
Hz, and a potential low
temperature sensitivity of 25 aN/
Hz. Membranes are
a practical mechanical resonator for use in MRFM be-
cause they are commercially available, low cost, and have
high sensitivity. Furthermore they are versatile in that
they have a large surface area, high resonant frequency,
and can be used in the ﬁelds of quantum optomechanics,
TEM, and MRFM. Given these properties, membranes
are a compelling candidate for a number of applications
such as a compact detector that can be used to identify
or image nuclear spins in microscopic samples.

VI. APPENDIX

To ﬁt the cyclic saturation data of ﬁgure 3, we calcu-
late the net force acting on the DPPH particle following
reference [14]. Frequency modulation causes the reso-
nant slice to oscillate spatially. The resonant slice is 50
µm in thickness, and the particle is 20 µm in size. As the
magnet approaches the particle, the leading edge of the
slice begins to cyclically enter and exit the particle. This
creates a force which resonantly drives the membrane.
Once the resonant slice is fully inside the particle, there
is no net force because spins on either side of the reso-
nant slice create oscillating forces with opposite phase,
yielding cancellation of the net force. As the resonant
slice exits the other side of the particle, a force is created
180 degrees out of phase with the drive, which the lock-in
records as a negative value.

where xstart and xend denote the position of the DPPH
particle, and xmagnet is the magnet’s position. As the res-
onant slice passes through the DPPH particle, we mea-
sure the cyclic saturation signal shown in ﬁgure 3. For
the second and third harmonics we replace M1 with M2
and M3 in equation 5 and solve for similar expressions,
which we use to ﬁt the data in ﬁgure 4.
