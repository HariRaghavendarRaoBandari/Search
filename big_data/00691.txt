Introduction

Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q = ph elements and let SLn(q) be the special linear group over
Fq. We denote by r(k) the rank of a matrix k ∈ Mn(Fq). We equip the groups SLn(q) with the
(normalized) rank-distance, d(, h) := 1
n r( − h) ∈ [0, 1]. Note that d is a bi-invariant metric,
which means that it is a metric such that d(h, k) = d(h, k) = d(h, k) for every , h, k ∈ SLn(q).
For every n ∈ N, we consider the diagonal embedding

Observe that for every n, ϕn is an isometric homomorphism. We denote by A0(q) the
countable group arising as the inductive limit of the family {(SL2n(q), ϕn)}n and observe that
we can extend the rank-metric d canonically to A0(q). Let A(q) be the metric-completion of
A0(q) with respect to d, i.e., A(q) is a Polish group and the natural extension of the rank-metric
is complete and bi-invariant. The purpose of this note is to study the topological group A(q).

In many ways one can think of A(q) as a ﬁnite characteristic analogue of the unitary
group of the hyperﬁnite II1-factor, which arises as a certain metric inductive limit of the
sequence of unitary groups U(2) ⊂ U(4) ⊂ U(8) ⊂ · · · , analogous to the construction above.
However, the group A(q) reﬂects at the same time in an intrinsic way asympotitic properties
of the the sequence of ﬁnite groups SLn(q) – in particular of the interplay of group structure,
normalized counting measure, and normalized rank-metric. In this note we want to develop
this analogy and prove various results that show similarities but also diﬀerences to the II1-
factor case. Some of the techniques that we are using are inspired by the theory of von
Neumann algebras whereas others are completely independent.

Our main result is the following theorem.

Theorem. The Polish group A(q) has the following properties:

• every strongly continuous unitary representation of A(q) on a Hilbert space is trivial,
• the group A(q) is extremely amenable,
• the center of A(q) is isomorphic to F×
• it contains every countable amenable group and, in case q is odd, the free group on two

q and the quotient by its center is topologically simple,

generators as discrete subgroups.

Before we start recalling some of the concepts that are used in the statement of the theorem,
let us make some further remarks. In a similar way, one can form an inductive limit of unital
rings

Fq ⊂ M2(Fq) ⊂ M4(Fq) ⊂ · · · ⊂ M0(Fq),

where again, the normalized rank-metric allows to complete M0(Fq) to a complete von
Neumann regular ring M(Fq). Following von Neumann, we can view M(Fq) as the coordi-
natization of a continuous geometry, see [25] for more details. The unit group of this ring is
naturally isomorphic to A(q). Indeed, any invertible element in M(Fq) must be the limit of
invertible elements and a rank-one perturbation takes care of the determinant. Note that the
algebra M(Fq) does not depend on the special choice of inclusions. Indeed, Halperin showed
in [17] that (in complete analogy to the II1-factor situation) any choice whatsoever yields the
same algebra. We thank Gábor Elek for pointing out Halperin’s work.

Unitary representability. We recall that a group is unitarily representable if it embeds in the
unitary group of a Hilbert space as a topological group and it is exotic if every continuous
unitary representation on a Hilbert space is trivial, see [2]. While all second countable locally
compact groups are unitarily representable – via the regular representation – there are several
examples of Polish groups that are not unitarily representable. For example, the Banach space
ℓp is unitarily representable if and only if 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, [23], see also [10, 11]. The ﬁrst example
of an exotic group was found by Herer and Christensen in [18] and a surprising result of
Megrelishvili, [24], states that the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the
interval has no non-trivial unitary representation (not even a representation on a reﬂexive

AN EXOTIC GROUP AS LIMIT OF FINITE SPECIAL LINEAR GROUPS

Banach space). However, most of the known examples of exotic groups are either abelian or
do not have a compatible bi-invariant metric

Amenability and extreme amenability. A topological group is said to be amenable if there ex-
ists an invariant mean on the commutative C∗-algebra of left-uniformly continuous complex-
valued functions on the group. It is a standard fact that any topological group that admits a
dense locally ﬁnite subgroup is amenable – in particular, the group A(q) is amenable for any
prime-power q. See Appendix G of [3] for more details.

A topological group is said to be extremely amenable if each continuous action of the group on
a compact topological space admits a ﬁxed point. See [27, 28] for more details. Let us remark
that every amenable exotic group is extremely amenable. Indeed, by amenability, any action
on a compact space preserves a probability measure; since the Koopman representation of
the action is by hypothesis trivial, the measure has to be a Dirac measure. The ﬁrst example
of an extremely amenable group was found by Herer and Christensen and they proved
extreme amenability exactly by showing that the group is amenable and exotic. Nowadays,
several examples of extremely amenable groups are known, for example the unitary group of
a separable Hilbert space [16], the automorphism group of a standard probability space [12],
and the full group of a hyperﬁnite equivalence relation [13]. However as for the previous
property, most of the known examples do not have a compatible bi-invariant metric.

Generalizations and Open problems. The proof of the theorem is robust and can be general-
ized to other (inductive) sequences of non-abelian ﬁnite (quasi-)simple groups of increasing
rank. Let us ﬁnish the introduction by listing a number of open problems that we ﬁnd
interesting and challenging.

• Is A(q) contractible?
• Is every homomorphism from A(q) to another Polish group automatically continuous?
• Does it have (isometric) representations on a reﬂexive Banach space?
• Does it have a unique Polish group topology?

The ﬁrst question has a positive answer in the case of the hyperﬁnite II1-factors by work
of Popa-Takesaki [30], but we were unable to generalize the methods to our setting. A more
detailed study of the more basic properties of the algebras M(Fq) and their unit groups A(q)
will be subject of another study.

1. No non-trivial unitary representations

In this ﬁrst section, we will prove that A(q) has no non-trivial continuous representation

on a Hilbert space, that is we will show that A(q) is exotic.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A complex continuous function ψ on a Polish group G is positive deﬁnite if
ψ(1G) = 1 and for every a1, . . . , an ∈ C and all 1, . . . , n ∈ G, we have

n

X

i, j=1

ai ¯ajψ(

−1
j i) ≥ 0.

A positive deﬁnite function χ is a character if it is conjugation invariant, that is for every

, h ∈ G, we have χ(hh−1) = χ().

Since by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, a positive deﬁnite function takes its maximal
value at the identity, any positive deﬁnite function is bounded in absolute value by 1. We
say that a positive deﬁnite function is trivial if ψ() = 1 for every  ∈ G. Every positive
deﬁnite function ψ also satisﬁes the following standard inequality, which can be found in [3,
Proposition C.4.2]:

(⋆)

|ψ() − ψ(h)|2 ≤ 2(1 − Re(ψ(

−1h))).

There is an important relation between positive deﬁnite functions and unitary represen-
tations: the GNS construction; any positive deﬁnite function gives rise to a unitary rep-
resentation and the diagonal matrix coeﬃcients of any unitary representation are positive
deﬁnite functions. In particular, a group without any non-trivial continuous positive deﬁnite
function has no non-trivial strongly continuous unitary representation on a Hilbert space,
see Appendix C of [3] for more informations.

The following useful proposition will be needed in the course of the proof.

Proposition 1.2. Let n, m ∈ N. The canonical inclusion SL2n(q) ֒→ A0(q) extends to an isometric
homomorphism SL2n(q2m

) ֒→ A0(q).

Proof. For every k, the ﬁeld F

It is a straightforward computation to show that for every , h ∈ M2n(F
In,k(h) = In,k()In,k(h). Moreover, if  ∈ SL2n(q), then det(In,k()) = 1:

by hypothesis det(0 + σk1) = 1 and αk − σk is the Galois-conjugate of σk, hence det(0 +
(αk − σk)1) = 1. This proves that In,k : SL2n(q2k+1
) is a well-deﬁned group
homomorphism. The homomorphism In,k is also isometric, in fact v = v0 + σkv1 ∈ ker() if
and only if (v0, v1) ∈ ker(In,k()). Composing the maps

(cid:3)

) := ∪nSL2n(q2m

Remark 1.3. Using the idea in the proof of Proposition 1.2, one can even show that the
inclusion SL2n(q) ֒→ A0(q) extends to SL2n(q2∞
) – a special linear group over
an inﬁnite ﬁeld. The characters of the group SL2n(q2∞
) were completely classiﬁed by Kirillov
[19] for n > 1 and by the work of Peterson and the second author [29] for n = 1. Any
non-trivial irreducible character of SL2n(q∞) is induced by its center, that is, χ() = χ(h) for
every non-central , h ∈ SL2n(q∞). This can be used in a straightforward way to show that the
group A(q) has no non-trivial continuous character. Note that Alt(2n) ⊂ SL2n(q) and that also
the work of Dudko and Medynets [6] can be invoked to study characters on A(q).

Now, Theorem 2.22 of [1] states that any amenable Polish group which admits a complete
bi-invariant metric is unitary representable if and only if its characters separate the points.
Whence, our observation from above implies readily that A(q) cannot be embedded into any
unitary group of a Hilbert space as a topological group.

In order to show that A(q) does not have any unitary representation on a Hilbert space,
we will show that every continuous positive deﬁnite function is trivial. For this, we need the
following lemma.

Lemma 1.4. Let q > 8 be a prime power and let ψ : SLn(q) → C be a positive deﬁnite function. If
there exists a non-central element  ∈ SLn(q) such that |1 − ψ(x−1

x)| < ε for all x ∈ SLn(q), then

|1 − ψ(h)| < 9(2ε + 16/q)1/2, ∀h ∈ SLn(q).

Proof. We set

χ(h) :=

1

|SLn(q)| X

x∈SLn(q)

ψ(x−1hx)

and note that χ : SLn(q) → C is a character. Hence, we can write

χ(h) = λ + X

π

λπχπ(h),

h ∈ SLn(q),

where π runs through the non-trivial irreducible representations π of SLn(q), χπ denotes the
normalized character of π, and λ + Pπ λπ = 1, λ ≥ 0 and λπ ≥ 0 for all π. By a result
of Gluck [14, Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 5.3], for every non-central element h ∈ SLn(q) and
every non-trivial, normalized, and irreducible character χπ we have |χπ(h)| < 8/q. By our

6

ALESSANDRO CARDERI AND ANDREAS THOM

assumption |1 − χ()| < ε and thus

λ = χ() − X

π

λπχπ() > 1 − ε − 8/q.

We conclude that

|1 − χ(h)| ≤ |χ(h) − λ| + (1 − λ) ≤ 2(1 − λ) < 2ε + 16/q, ∀h ∈ SLn(q).

For ﬁxed h, the preceding inequality, Markov’s inequality and the fact that ϕ is bounded in
absolute value by 1 imply that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
nx ∈ SLn(q) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|1 − ψ(x−1hx)| ≥ 3(2ε + 16/q)o(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤

|SLn(q)|

3

and hence that at least 2/3 of all elements in the conjugacy class of h satisfy

Since this holds for all conjugacy classes, we can set

|1 − ψ(k)| < 3(2ε + 16/q).

A := (cid:8)k ∈ SLn(q) | |1 − ψ(k)| < 3(2ε + 16/q)(cid:9)

and conclude that |A| ≥ 2/3 · |SLn(q)|. Therefore for any h ∈ SLn(q), the set A ∩ hA−1 , ∅ and
thus there exist k1, k2 ∈ A such that h = k1k2. So the inequality (⋆) yields

|ψ(k1) − ψ(h)|2 ≤ 2(1 − Re(ψ(k2))) ≤ 6(2ε + 16/q)

and hence

|1 − ψ(h)| ≤ |ψ(1) − ψ(k1)| + |ψ(k1) − ψ(h)| ≤ 3(2ε + 16/q) + (6(2ε + 16/q))1/2 ≤ 9(2ε + 16/q)1/2.

This proves the claim.

(cid:3)

Let us now ﬁx a positive deﬁnite function ψ : A(q) → C. Let ε > 0 and choose δ > 0 such
that d(1A(q), x) < δ implies |1 − ψ(x)| < ε. For n large enough, the group SL2n(q) will contain
a non-central element  with d(1A(q), ) < δ. By conjugation invariance of the metric, we
conclude that |1 − ψ(xx−1)| < ε for all x ∈ A(q). Moreover, SL2n(q) ⊂ SL2n (qm) ⊂ A(q) as
explained in Proposition 1.2. So applying the previous lemma to SL2n(qm), we get that the
restriction of ψ to SL2n(q) satisﬁes

|1 − ψ(h)| < 9(2ε + 16/qm)1/2, ∀h ∈ SL2n(q).

Since this holds for any m ∈ N, we conclude that |1 − ψ(h)| ≤ 9(2ε)1/2 for all h ∈ SL2n(q) and n
large enough. Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, we must have that the restriction of ψ to any SL2n(q)
is trivial, and hence by density of A0(q) in A(q) we can conclude the proof.

Remark 1.5. For the proof of our main theorem, it is not necessary to apply Gluck’s concrete
estimates. Indeed, it follows already from Kirillov’s work on characters of SLn(k) for inﬁnite
ﬁelds k [19] that character values of non-central elements in SLn(q) have to be uniformly small

AN EXOTIC GROUP AS LIMIT OF FINITE SPECIAL LINEAR GROUPS

7

as q tends to inﬁnity. This is enough to conclude the proof. One can see the existence of small
uniform bounds either by going through the techniques in Kirillov’s proof (see also the proof
of Theorem 2.4 in [29]) or by applying Kirillov’s character rigidity to a suitable ultra-product
of ﬁnite groups SLn(q) (for n ﬁxed and q variable) which can be identiﬁed with SLn(k), where
k is the associated ultraproduct of ﬁnite ﬁelds, which is itself an inﬁnite ﬁeld.

2. A second route to extreme amenability

2.1. Lévy groups. As outlined in the beginning, every amenable and exotic group is ex-
tremely amenable. However, there is a diﬀerent route to extreme amenability using the
phenomenon of measure-concentration. In this section, we want to show that A(q) is a Lévy
group and hence extremely amenable. See [27, 28] for more background on this topic. A
similar approach was recently carried out in [4] to give a direct proof that the unitary group
of the hyperﬁnite II1-factor is extremely amenable. As a by-product, we can give explicit
bounds on the concentration function that are useful to give quantitative bounds in various
non-commutative Ramsey theoretic applications.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A metric measure space (X, d, µ) consists in a set X equipped with a distance
d and measure µ which is compatible with the metric, see [28]. In the following we will
always assume that µ is a probability measure. Given a subset A ⊂ X we will denote by Ar
the r-neighbourhood of A, i.e., Ar := {x ∈ X | ∃y ∈ A, d(x, y) < r}. The concentration function of
(X, d, µ) is deﬁned as

(1)

α(X,d,µ)(r) := sup(cid:26)1 − µ(Ar) | A ⊂ X, µ(A) ≥

1

2(cid:27) , r > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A sequence of metric measure spaces (Xn, dn, µn) with diameter constant
equal to 1, is a Lévy family if for every r ≥ 0,

α(Xn,dn,µn)(r) → 0.

A Polish group G (with compatible metrid d) is called a Lévy group if there exists a sequence
(Gn)n of compact subgroups of G equipped with their normalized Haar measure µn, such
that (Gn, d|Gn, µn) is a Lévy family. If this is the case, we say that the measure concentrates
along the sequence of subgroups.

The relationship with extreme amenability is given by the following theorem which can

be found in [28, Theorem 4.1.3].

Theorem 2.3. Every Lévy group is extremely amenable.

Our second route to extreme amenability is therefore to show that (SL2n(q))n is a Le ´vy

family with respect to the normalized counting measure and the normalized rank-metric.

Theorem 2.4. The normalized counting measure on the groups SL2n(q) concentrates with respect to
the rank-metric. In particular, A(q) is a Lévy group and hence extremely amenable.

8

ALESSANDRO CARDERI AND ANDREAS THOM

The proof of the theorem is a straightforward application of the following theorem, whose

proof can be found in [28, Theorem 4.5.3] or [20, Theorem 4.4]

Theorem 2.5. Let G be a compact metric group, metrized by a bi-invariant metric d, and let

{1} = H0 < H1 < H2 < · · · < Hn = G

be a chain of subgroups. Denote by ai the diameter of the homogenous space Hi/Hi−1, i = 1, . . . , n, with
regard to the factor metric. Then the concentration function of the metric-measure space (G, d, µ),
where µ is the normalized Haar measure, satisﬁes

−

16Pn
i=1 a2
i
Proof of Theorem 2.4. Let us ﬁx a base {e1, . . . , en} of Fn
q . Using the previous theorem, it is
enough to show that the diameter of SLn(q)/SLn−1(q) is smaller than 2
n , where SLn−1(q) < SLn(q)
is the subgroup ﬁxing en. For this, it is enough to show that for every  ∈ SLn(q), there exists
h ∈ SLn−1(q) ⊂ SLn(q), such that r(h−1) ≤ 2. Let V be a 2-dimensional vector space containing
en and en and let V′ be a complement. There exists h′ ∈ SL(V) with h′(en) = en. Hence,
(h′ ⊕ 1V′)en = en and thus (h′ ⊕ 1V′) ∈ SLn−1(q). Moreover,



d(, (h′ ⊕ 1V′)) = r( − (h′ ⊕ 1V′)) = r((h′ − 1V) ⊕ 0V′) ≤ 2.

This proves the claim.

(cid:3)

2.2. Ramsey theory. The crucial concept behind the strategy in the previous proof is the
notion of length of a metric measure space (see Deﬁnition 3.2.26 in [27]), which is essentially
i )1/2 as above. The following lemma is immediate from

the inﬁmum over the quantities (Pi a2

our computation.

Lemma 2.6. The length of the metric measure space (SLn(q), d, µn) is at most 2n−1/2.

Any estimate on the length of a metric measure space can be used directly to get explicit
bounds on the concentration phenomena, such as in the following standard lemma, whose
proof is inspired by the proof of Theorem 3.2.28 in [27].

Lemma 2.7. Let (G, d, µ) be a metric measure space of length L and A ⊂ G be measurable. Then, for
any ε > 0:

µ(A) > 2 exp(−(ε/L)2) ⇒ µ(A4ε) ≥ 1 − 2 exp(−(ε/L)2).

Proof. Consider the function x 7→ d(A, x) = inf{d(a, x) | a ∈ A}. We set λ := E(d(A, .)). Since
d(A, .) is 1-Lipschitz, it follows from Lemma 3.2.27 in [27] that

µ ({x ∈ G | |d(x, A) − λ| ≥ δ}) ≤ 2 exp(−δ2/(4L2)), ∀δ > 0.

Using this for δ = 2ε and our assumption, we get λ ≤ 2ε. But now we have to have
1 − µ(A4ε) = µ(G \ A4ε) ≤ 2 exp(−(ε/L)2).

(cid:3)

Let us ﬁnish this section by applying the previously obtained bounds in order to obtain

an explicit metric Ramsey theoretic result for the ﬁnite groups SLn(q).

As usual, we say that a covering of a metric space X has Lebesgue number ε > 0, if every
point in X is contained in some element of the covering together with an ε-neighborhood.
A covering that admits a positive Lebesgue number ε will be called a uniform covering
or ε-covering. Uniform covers have been studied in the context of amenability, extreme
amenability, and Ramsey theory in [31]. Our main result in this section is a quantitative form
of the metric Ramsey property that is satisﬁed by the ﬁnite groups SLn(q) – resembling the
fact the A(q) is extremely amenable.

Theorem 2.8. Let ε > 0, q be a prime power, and k, m ∈ N. There exists N := N(ε, k, m), such that
for any n > N and any ε-cover of SLn(q) of cardinality at most m the following holds: for every subset
F ⊂ SLn(q) of cardinality at most k, there exists  ∈ SLn(q) such that F ⊂ U, for some member U of
the covering. Moreover, it is enough to take

N(ε, k, m) =

64 · max{log(2k), m}

ε2

.

In order to illustrate the result, consider the case k = 3, m = 2 and ε > 0. We may think of
a uniform covering by two sets as a coloring of SLn(q) with two colors, where some group
elements get both colors – the coloring must satisfy that for any element there exists one of
the two colors, so that an entire ε-neighborhood of this element gets at least this color. Now,
if n > 128 · ε−2, any subset of three elements {a, b, c} ⊂ SLn(q) has a translate {a, b, c} colored
in the same color. It is easy to see that this fails for example for (R/Z, +) with its usual metric.

Proof of Theorem 2.8. Let U be the covering and set U0 := {x ∈ SLn(q) | B(x, ε) ⊂ U} for every
U ∈ U. By assumption, the collection V := {U0 | U ∈ U} still forms a covering of X. If
the cardinality of the covering is at most m, there must be one element V ∈ V in the new
covering with µn(V) ≥ 1
m . Let U ∈ U with Vε ⊂ U. By the previous lemma, and assuming
that 1/m > exp(−ε2n/64), we conclude that 1 − 2 exp(−ε2n/64) ≤ µ(Vε) ≤ µ(U). Now

(cid:8) ∈ SLn(q) | F ⊂ U(cid:9) = \

h∈F (cid:8) ∈ SLn(q) | h ⊂ U(cid:9) = \

h∈F

Uh−1

and thus if |F| ≤ k, we get that µ({ ∈ SLn(q) | F ⊂ U}) ≥ 1 − 2k exp(−ε2n/64). Hence, some
element  ∈ SLn(q) as desired will exist as soon as n > 64 · max{log(2k), m} · ε−2.

(cid:3)

3. Topological simplicity of the central quotient

In this last section, we will determine the center of A(q) and we will prove that A(q) is

simple modulo its center.

As we remarked in the introduction A(q) is isomorphic to the group of invertible elements
of M(Fq). Therefore for every α ∈ F×
q the “diagonal matrix” whose non-zero entries are equal
to α is an element of A(q) and it is in the center. Let us denote by Z ⊂ A(q) the group of

10

ALESSANDRO CARDERI AND ANDREAS THOM

diagonal matrices with constant values, Z (cid:27) F×
q . We claim that Z is actually the center of A(q)
and that A(q)/Z is simple. Note that the quotient A(q)/Z can be understood as the completion
of the metric inductive limit of the corresponding projective linear groups with respect to the
projective rank-metric as studied in [33].

To prove the claim, we will need the following theorem of Liebeck and Shalev which
follows from [21, Lemma 5.4], see also [33] for a discussion of the results of Liebeck-Shalev
in the context of length functions on quasi-simple groups.

Theorem 3.1 (Liebeck-Shalev). There exists c ∈ N such that for every n ∈ N and for every
 ∈ SLn(q) with δ := min{d(, z) | z ∈ F×

q } > 0, we have CSLn(q)()⌈c/δ⌉ = SLn(q).

For an element  of the group H, we denote by CH() its conjugacy class. As a corollary of

this theorem we obtain the following.

Proposition 3.2. For every  ∈ A(q) such that δ = min{d(, z) | z ∈ F×
A(q) is dense.

Before proving the propostion, let us remark that the proposition implies our claim. Let
N < A(q) be a closed normal subgroup which contains strictly Z and take x ∈ N \ Z. By the
previous proposition, there exists m ∈ N such that CA(q)(x)m is dense, which implies that N is
dense and therefore N = A(q).

Proof of Proposition 3.2. For every ε < δ/2, we consider an element 
Let n0 be such that 
SL2n(q) for m := ⌈c/δ⌉, whence

′) ≤ ε.

CA(q)(

This means that for any element k ∈ A(q), there exist h1, . . . , hm ∈ A(q) such that

Since the rank-metric is bi-invariant we obtain that

which implies that d(CA(q)()m, k) ≤ (m + 1)ε.

Remark 3.3. It is likely that methods from [5] will show that A(q) modulo its center is in fact
simple as a discrete group and has the bounded normal generation property – this will be
subject of forthcoming work.

Remark 3.4. Since the center of A(q) is Z = F×
q , we can conclude that A(q) is isomorphic to
A(q′) if and only if q = q′. One could ask also if the quotient group A(q)/Z depends on q.
The question seems harder, but one can study centralizer of elements in A(q)/Z as in [35] to
deduce that this group depends at least on the characteristic of the ﬁeld.

4. Maximally discrete subgroups of A(q)

In this section we want to study discrete subgroups of A(q).

In fact, we will focus on
subgroups Γ ⊂ A(q) so that d(1, ) = 1 for all non-identity elements of Γ – we call such a
subgroup maximally discrete in A(q). Let us start with amenable groups.

Proposition 4.1. Every countable amenable group is isomorphic to a maximally discrete subgroup of
the group A(q).

Proof. Note that A(q) contains the an isometric copy of the inductive limit of symmetric
groups

S2 ⊂ S4 ⊂ · · · ⊂ S2n ⊂ · · · ,

equipped with the normalized Hamming metric, which is isometrically isomorphic to the full
group of the hyperﬁnite equivalence relation with its canonical metric. By [26], it contains
any amenable group as maximal discrete subgroup.

(cid:3)

The aim of this section is to show the following theorem.

Theorem 4.2. If q is odd, A(q) contains a non-abelian free group as a maximally discrete subgroup.

We thank Gabor Elek for references and ideas leading to this result. Theorem 4.2 follows in
an implicit way from Elek’s work [9] and [8]. In fact, Elek showed that any amenable skew-
ﬁeld of characteristc p embeds as a discrete sub-algebra of M(Fp) and by [15], it follows that
in odd characteristic, there exist amenable skew-ﬁelds with free subgroups. However we do
not need the full strength of Elek’s techniques and we will construct an explicit embedding
of a skew-ﬁled containing a free group into M(Fq).

Note that the analogous result is not true in the setting of II1-factors, i.e., the free group
on two generators is not a maximally discrete (which in this case should mean that diﬀerent
group elements are orthogonal with respect to the trace) subgroup of the unitary group of
the hyperﬁnite II1-factor. Moreover, the preceding result seems to yield the ﬁrst example
of a non-amenable subgroup of an amenable Polish group, whose topology is given by a
bi-invariant metric. It is an open problem, if the free group on two generators (or in fact
any discrete non-amenable group) can be a discrete subgroup of the unitary group of the
hyperﬁnite II1-factor or the topological full group of the hyperﬁnite equivalence relation.

The proof of Theorem 4.2 is based on the following lemma, which is using Elek’s canonical

rank function, see [7].

Lemma 4.3. Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated amenable group and suppose that there is a Følner sequence
(Fn) such that Fn+1 = FnDn where Dn ⊂ Γ is a ﬁnite subset, so that the family {Fnc | c ∈ Dn} consists
of pairwise disjoint subsets. Then, there exists an embedding Φ : FqΓ → M(Fq), such that for every
a ∈ FqΓ which is not a zero-divisor, the element Φ(a) ∈ M(Fq) is invertible.

Proof. For every h ∈ Γ and n ∈ N, we deﬁne Lh
n := { ∈ Fn | h ⊂ Fn} and we observe that for
every ε > 0 and h ∈ Γ, there exists N ∈ N such that for every n ≥ N, we have |Lh
n| > (1 − ε)|Fn|.
Then we set kn := |Fn| and the equality Fn+1 = FnDn yields a natural unital embedding
Mkn(Fq) ⊂ Mkn+1(Fq). As before, we can take the inductive limit M0 := limn Mkn (Fq) along this
sequence and complete the result with respect to the natural induced rank metric to obtain
a complete von Neumann regular metric ring M. The ring M is isometrically isomorphic to
M(Fq) by a result of Halperin [17].

For ﬁxed h ∈ Γ, we deﬁne elements hn ∈ Mkn(Fq) as the usual action by permutation on
the left on Lh
n and 0 on the complement. It is now easy to observe that (hn)n is a Cauchy
sequence for every h ∈ Γ and we set Φ(h) := limn hn. Since the rank of hn tends to 1 as n tends
to inﬁnity, Φ(h) is invertible. Moreover, it is easy to see that Φ : Γ → A(q) is a homomorphism
and the image is maximally discrete. Hence, we deﬁned a maximal discrete embedding of
Γ into the group of invertible elements A(q). The map Φ : FqΓ → M(Fq) is deﬁned to be the
linearization of the group homomorphism h 7→ Φ(h).

Let us ﬁx a non zero-divisor a ∈ FqΓ and let us denote by S ⊂ Γ the support of a. For every
n, we deﬁne La
n := { ∈ Fn | S ⊂ Fn} and we observe that for every ε, there exists N ∈ N
such that for every n ≥ N, we have |La
n| > (1 − ε)|Fn|. Again, the sequence (an)n which act
on La
n as left convolution is a Cauchy sequence and we obtain Φ(a) = limn an. We claim that
the vectors {an}∈La
n and α1, . . . , αk ∈ Fq
are such that Pi a(αii) = 0 then a(Pi αii) = 0 and whence a is a zero-divisor in FqΓ. So the
rank of an is at least 1 − ε for n large enough and hence, in the limit, the rank of Φ(a) is 1 and
therefore it is invertible.

n are linearly independent. In fact if 1, . . . , k ∈ La

Proof of Theorem 4.2. For the proof it is enough to study the Heisenberg group over Z, which
clearly satisﬁes our assumptions on existence of special Følner sets. However, some of the
arguments work in greater generality. Indeed, let Γ be an elementary amenable, torsion free
group which satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 4.3. By [22, Theorem 2.3], every non-zero
element of the group algebra FqΓ is a not a zero-divisor. By Tamari [34, Example 8.16],
we know that group rings of amenable groups which do not contain zero-divisors satisfy
the Ore condition, for more about the Ore localization see [32]. Hence the Ore localization
of FqΓ, denoted by Q(FqΓ), can be deﬁned and is a skew-ﬁeld. Consider the embedding
Φ : FqΓ → M(Fq) as deﬁned in Lemma 4.3. Observe that by the universality of the Ore
localization, Φ extends to a homomorphism Φ : Q(FqΓ) → M(Fq). In particular, we obtain an
isomorphic copy of Q(FqΓ)× in A(q) as maximally discrete subgroup. When Γ is non-abelian
and nilpotent, for example when Γ is the Heisenberg group over Z, then Q(FqΓ)× has free
subgroups by Theorem 5 of [15]. This concludes the proof.

(cid:3)

It is likely, that the assumption on existence of special Følner sets in the previous arguments
is not necessary, using a suitable version of Ornstein-Weiss quasi-tiling theory [26, page 24,

Theorem 6]. However, the arguments are more complicated and we do not want to go into
those details here.
