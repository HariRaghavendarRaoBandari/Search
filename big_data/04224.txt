Abstract

We report here the development of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) interface
between the plane–wave density functional theory based CPMD code and the empirical force–ﬁeld based
GULP code for modeling periodic solids and surfaces. The hybrid QM/MM interface is based on the
electrostatic coupling between QM and MM regions. The interface is designed for carrying out full relaxation
of all the QM and MM atoms during geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations, including
the boundary atoms. Both Born–Oppenheimer and Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics schemes are enabled
for the QM part during the QM/MM calculations. This interface has the advantage of parallelization of both
the programs such that the QM and MM force evaluations can be carried out in parallel in order to model
large systems. The interface program is ﬁrst validated for total energy conservation and parallel scaling
performance is benchmarked. Oxygen vacancy in α–cristobalite is then studied in detail and the results are
compared with a fully QM calculation and experimental data. Subsequently, we use our implementation
to investigate the structure of rhodium cluster (Rhn; n=2 to 6) formed from Rh(C2H4)2 complex adsorbed
within a cavity of Y–zeolite in a reducible atmosphere of H2 gas.

1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics

(QM) potential based
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (known as
ab initio MD) of industrially important catalytic
reactions is challenging due to the length–scale of
the system and the time–scale of the processes that
need to be addressed. A pragmatic way to bridge
the length–scales (for such problems) is by us-
ing hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechan-
ics (QM/MM) [1] methods. [2–8] In a QM/MM cal-
culation, a small portion of the catalytic system
(i.e.
the active site) is treated by a QM poten-
tial, while the rest of the large portion of the sys-
tem is treated by a computationally cheap empirical
molecular mechanics (MM) potential. A few hun-
dreds of pico–second long MD simulation for ∼105
MM atoms and ∼ 102 QM atoms in a QM/MM

simulation is feasible today.
In order to bridge
the diﬀerences in time scales of such simulations
(∼ 102 ps) and that of a catalytic processes (sec-
onds to hours), enhanced sampling MD techniques,
such as metadynamics [9] have to be used. Thus to
address complex catalytic processes computation-
ally, a QM/MM interface program which can carry
out enhanced sampling MD simulations of chemical
reactions would be ideal.

A particularly interesting catalytic system is the
supported catalysts, where metallic clusters ad-
sorbed on a solid support is the active site. [10]
Zeolite–supported metal clusters are potential cat-
alysts for various chemical reactions. [11–14] Com-
putational modeling of zeolites using a (fully) QM
potential is extremely computationally demanding
due to large number of atoms in its unit cell and
its large volume. On the other hand, a QM/MM
method is optimal to model such systems. QM/MM
approaches have been developed to study zeolite
and similar silica systems. [15–23]

A key component of the QM/MM method is
the QM–MM electrostatic interaction. In a plane–
wave density functional theory (DFT) based ap-
proach employing an electronic embedding scheme,
interaction between electron density and MM point
charges has to be accounted in the Hamiltonian.
Here QM density is solved in the presence of the ex-
ternal ﬁeld of MM charges and a total energy con-
serving QM/MM MD Hamiltonian can be formu-
lated. [24] A computationally eﬃcient dual space–
grid based QM/MM implementation for plane–
wave basis was suggested by Yarne et al. [25] and
similar approach has been also implemented for
a mixed Gaussian/plane–wave basis set. [26,27] In
these implementations, a modiﬁed Coulomb kernel
function is used to avoid over-polarization of elec-
tronic density (or electron spill out) due to the MM
charges, which is severe in the case of plane–wave
basis. A low MM point charge based MZHB force–
ﬁeld has been proposed to avert electron spill out for
QM/MM applications in silica. [28] Dangling bonds
at the QM/MM boundary can be either treated by
pseudopotentials [29] or by introducing capping hy-
drogen atoms. [30]

Here we report the development of a QM/MM
interface code for treating periodic solids in or-
der to study complex catalytic processes using
MD techniques. We choose CPMD [31] as the
QM code mainly due to its eﬃcient implementa-
tion of Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (MD)
and methods such as metadynamics [9] CPMD can
carry out pseudopotential based plane–wave DFT
computations. As the MM code, we choose the
GULP [32] program, mainly because of its simplic-
ity in usage and it has implementations of variety
of popular empirical force–ﬁelds for treating peri-
odic solids. Moreover, both CPMD and GULP have
parallel implementations using Message Passing In-
terface (MPI), which is advantageous for treat-
ing large systems. A number of QM/MM inter-
faces for treating bimolecular systems are avail-
able for CPMD, such as the CPMD/EGO by
Eichinger et al. [33], CPMD/GROMOS by Laio
et al., [24] CPMD/Gromacs interface by Biswas
and Gogonea [34] and CPMD/Iphigenie by Schw¨orer
et al. [35]. However, the available QM/MM inter-
faces do not allow one to use variety of empirical
potentials for treating periodic solids and has mo-
tivated us to develop the CPMD/GULP QM/MM
interface.

In

this work, we

ing zeolite supported Rhn clusters.
Recently
B. C. Gates and coworkers [36,37] have reported the
synthesis and characterization of small Rh clus-
ters from mononuclear Rh complex supported in
Y–zeolite. The formation of Rh cluster depends on
the temperature and on the nature of the ligands
and the support. [37] Rh–Rh distance measured
using the extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) technique and infrared (IR) spectrum [38]
reveals the presence of H atom impurity in the
Rhn cluster. These Rh complexes and clusters are
active catalyst for dimerization and hydrogenation
reactions of ethene and their catalytic activity
depends on the nuclearity of the catalyst. [39] We
have investigated the thermodynamically most
stable protonation states of Rhn clusters, n = 2 − 6,
on Y–zeolite as a function of temperature and
pressure. To compute the thermodynamic stability
of a protonated form of a cluster, we considered
its formation from Rh(C2H4)2 complex in the
presence of H2 gas. R¨osch and co–workers have
addressed supported Rh clusters using QM/MM
and DFT calculations.
The reverse hydrogen
spillover reactions on Rh6 and other late–transition
metal clusters supported by zeolites have been
studied in detail. [40,41] Benchmark studies of
QM/MM calculations have been reported for C–C
coupling and hydrogenation reactions involving
zeolite–supported [Rh(C2H4)2(H2)]+. [42] Structure
and properties of protonated Rhn clusters in
Y–zeolite were also investigated using periodic
DFT. [43]

In this paper, we ﬁrst present the technical
and computational details of the CPMD/GULP
QM/MM implementation, followed by results. Test
on the accuracy of the implementation is carried out
by verifying the total energy conservation in a mi-
crocanonical ensemble MD simulation of Y–zeolite.
Parallel eﬃciency of both QM and MM parts
in our QM/MM implementation is then demon-
strated. We study the neutral oxygen vacancy in
α–cristobalite and compare the defect formation en-
ergy, and electronic, structural and dynamic prop-
erties from a canonical ensemble QM/MM MD sim-
ulation with a fully QM simulation and with avail-
able experimental data. Finally, we investigate the
free energy of formation of RhnHm (n=2 to 6) clus-
ters supported on Y−zeolite, at various tempera-
tures. Properties of stable RhnHm/Y clusters at
300 K is then obtained by QM/MM MD simula-
tions.

2. Methods

2.1. QM/MM Coupling

QM/MM potential energy of a system is given

by,

EPE = EQM + EMM + EQM/MM ,

(1)

where EQM, EMM and EQM/MM are the energies
of QM subsystem, MM subsystem and interac-
tion energy between QM and MM subsystems, re-
spectively. EQM/MM is composed of electrostatic
and van der Waals interactions, where the elec-
trostatic interaction is computed between an MM
point charge and QM electron density following
Ref. [24] as

EEL = XIεMM

qI Z drρ(r)

cI − r4
r4
r5
cI − r5

(2)

where a modiﬁed Coulomb kernel is used to avoid
electron spill out problems. Here, qI is the point
charge of an MM atom I, ρ(r) is the electron den-
sity at a real space grid r, rcI is the covalent ra-
dius parameter for an atom I, and r is the distance
between atom I and the grid r representing ρ(r).
A more eﬃcient approach to carry out electrostatic
coupling will be to employ the dual space grid based
coupling proposed in Ref. [25], and later by Laino et
al. [26,27], and will be implemented and tested in the
future.

When the QM/MM boundary passes through a
covalent bond special care has been taken. In the
presented work, we follow a link atom scheme where
H atoms are used to saturate the dangling bonds of
a QM atom at the QM/MM boundary. The elec-
trostatic interactions computed using Eqn. 2 are
excluded between bonded pair of atoms of QM and
MM regions by giving an exclusion list. The elec-
trostatic interaction between bonded pair of atoms
spanning across the QM and MM regions are com-
puted as per the MM potential. The MM atoms in
this exclusion list is interacting with the rest of the
QM atoms through dynamically generated electro-
static potential (D–RESP) derived charges. [44]

The QM/MM Lagrangian in the framework of

Car–Parrinello scheme is given by,

Here the ﬁrst and the second terms are the kinetic
energy of nucleus and ﬁctitious kinetic energy of or-
bitals. EKS is the Kohn–Sham energy which is iden-
tical to EQM in Eqn. 1. The last term ensures that
the orthonormality constraints are fulﬁlled during
the time evolution of wavefunctions.

2.2. Implementation Details

Our QM/MM implementation that combines
both CPMD and the GULP codes, makes use
of the eﬃcient parallel
implementation of both
these programs using MPI. For this purpose, two
MPI communication groups are formed within the
CPMD program to handle communications within
the CPMD and the GULP programs independently.
The communication between these two MPI groups
are only to exchange the coordinates and the forces
at every MD step, and thus the communication
overhead is usually insigniﬁcant. Both the pro-
grams run in parallel during the force–evaluation,
which is crucial to address large systems of interest.
The CPMD code is the main MD driver which al-
lows the user to take advantages of diﬀerent existing
MD features of the CPMD package, in particular,
Car–Parrinello MD.

2.3. Benchmark calculations using FAU zeolite

To validate the code, a 1×1×1 supercell of pure
silica FAU zeolite (Si192O384) was taken. We
performed N V E ensemble simulation using the
QM/MM Hamiltonian, where a Si2O7 unit was
treated within the QM region and the rest in the
MM region. The 6 oxygen atoms at the QM/MM
boundary were capped by H atoms. Free boundary
conditions were used for the QM supercell (since
the basis functions are plane waves) to obtain non–
periodic electronic density. QM subsystem was
taken in a cubic supercell of side 13.22 ˚A. A cubic
periodic supercell of size 24.50 ˚A was used for the
whole system, which was initially optimized using
the MM force-ﬁeld. For further testing the scalabil-
ity of both CPMD and GULP, a 2×2×2 supercell of
FAU zeolite (Si1536O3072) was taken. The QM re-
gion contained a T6 site (Si6O18) and 12 capping H
atoms for terminal O atoms. The QM system was
taken in a cubic supercell of edge length 17.46 ˚A,
and the cubic periodic supercell with side 48.96 ˚A
was used for the whole system.

The MM part was treated using the low–point
charge MZHB potential for SiO2 from Ref. [28] This
low–point charge force–ﬁeld was necessary to avoid

over polarization of the electron density due to large
MM point charges, especially because wavefunction
is described using plane wave basis set. A 30 Ry
plane wave cutoﬀ was used to expand wavefunc-
tion, and ultrasoft pseudopotentials [45] were used
to treat core electrons. All the calculations were
closed shell and were using the PBE [46] exchange
correlation functional.

In QM/MM N V E simulations, all the QM and
MM atoms were let free to move, but the capping
hydrogens were constrained to move in the direc-
tion of the Si–O bond along the QM/MM bound-
ary. MD simulations of the QM part were carried
out using the Car–Parrinello scheme, [47] while both
the QM and the MM atoms were propagated by a
timestep of 4 a.u. The ﬁctitious orbital mass in the
Car–Parrinello dynamics was set to 600 a.u. and
hydrogen atom mass (for the capping atoms) was
replaced with deuterium. For N V E simulations, no
thermostats were coupled to the orbital degrees of
freedom.

2.4. Neutral oxygen vacancy in α–Cristobalite

The neutral oxygen vacancy in α–Cristobalite has
been studied to benchmark the performance of the
CPMD/GULP QM/MM code. The defect forma-
tion energy in this system computed using periodic
DFT (full QM) is compared with that computed
using the CPMD/GULP QM/MM code. The va-
cancy formation energy, ∆Ef , was computed as,

∆Ef =

[E(O2) + Ediss(O2)]

1
2
+ E(SiO2−x ) − E(SiO2)

(4)

Here, E(O2), Ediss(O2), E(SiO2−x ), and, E(SiO2)
are energy of O2 molecule (in the triplet electronic
ground state), dissociation energy of O2 molecule,
energy of bulk silica with oxygen vacancy, and en-
ergy of pure bulk silica, respectively. E(O2) was
computed from QM calculation whereas E(SiO2−x )
and E(SiO2) were computed either by QM or
QM/MM calculations. Ediss(O2) was taken from
experimental data (5.16 eV). [48]

The initial

lattice parameters of the system
were taken from Ref. [49], which were further op-
timized using the MM force–ﬁeld. [28] For the fully
QM periodic DFT calculation, three diﬀerent su-
percells, 2×2×2 (Si32O64) , 3×3×2 (Si72O144) ,
and 3×3×3 (Si108O216) were taken, while in the
QM/MM simulations a supercell of size 9×9×9
(Si2916O5832) was considered. We performed three

left 8T, 14T, and, 26T) in the QM/MM calculations are

set of QM/MM calculations with diﬀerent sizes of
the QM–subsystems: 8T (Si8O25), 14T (Si14O40),
and 26T (Si26O93), where T stands for a (shared)
SiO4 tetrahedral site; see Fig. 1. Oxygen vacancy
was created by removing one of the oxygen atoms
(in the QM region) from its lattice position (as
shown in Fig. 1).

We employed simulated annealing of both nuclei
and orbitals within the Car–Parrinello scheme to
optimize the structure, followed by a quasi-Newton
based optimization for nuclei and conjugate gra-
dient minimization for orbitals, whenever neces-
sary. N V T ensemble simulations were carried out
at 300 K using Nos´e–Hoover Chain (NHC) ther-
mostats. [50] The whole QM and the MM atoms were
relaxed during all the MD simulations runs. All the
other computational details are identical to that in
Section 2.3.

2.5. Study of Zeolite Supported Rhn (n = 2 − 6)

Clusters

As an application of our implementation, we
study the structure of protonated Rhn, n = 2 − 6
in HY–zeolites. Cluster formation is investigated at
a range of temperature and pressure by employing
ab–initio thermodynamics techniques. [51,52] Based
on the experiments [36] where cluster formation has
been observed, we modelled the cluster formation
reaction for n > 2 as,

RhnHm/Y + Rh(C2H4)2/Y

+ xH2 → Rhn+1Hm′ /Y + HY + 2C2H6

(5)

where m′ = m + 2x − 5, and odd number of m
and m′ values are only considered in this study as-
suming that H2 adsorption in RhnH cluster (and
not the bare Rhn cluster) due to reverse spillover

4

reaction. Protonation of the Y zeolite is incorpo-
rated by the formation of HY during this reaction.
The maximum value of m and m′ (and thus x) are
determined by the maximum number of hydrogen
atoms that can be adsorbed on a given cluster (for
x > 0).

The maximum number of H atom in the Rhn
cluster is 2n+ 1 as the optimum H/Rh ratio is 2. [53]
Thus we considered 19 diﬀerent cluster formation
chemical reactions and are listed in the Supporting
Information.

Free energy of these cluster formation reactions

were computed as

∆Gcf (T, p) = G(Rhn+1Hm′ /Y) + G(HY)

+ 2µC2H6 − G(RhnHm/Y)

− G(Rh(C2H4)2/Y) − xµH2

(6)

The enthalpy of zeolite supported metal com-
plex/clusters is approximated by the potential en-
ergy (E) of the system as the eﬀect due to the
change their volume is negligible compared to other
terms in the equation for the range p and T consid-
ered here. We rewrite Eqn. 6 as,

∆Gcf (T, p) = ∆Ecf − T ∆Scf(T )

+ 2∆µC2H6 (T, pC2H6 )

to the most stable structure of the corresponding
species among various conﬁgurations of the system
explored in simulated annealing optimizations. In
Eqn. 9, the ∆H and ∆S were obtained from ther-
mochemical data. [54] The entropic terms in Eqn. 10
are computed from MD simulations [55] at temper-
ature T using

For the formation of Rh2 cluster, we use

where

− E(Rh(C2H4)2/Y) − xEH2 ,

− SRhnHm/Y(T ) − SRh(C2H4)2/Y(T ) .

(10)

Here kB is the Boltzmann constant, and p0 is the
standard pressure. Partial pressure of a gaseous
component i is indicated as pi. EC2H6 and EH2
in Eqn. 8 were computed using QM calculations.
The individual energy terms in Eqn. 8 corresponds

2Rh(C2H4)2/Y + yH2 →

Rh2Hm/Y + HY + 4C2H6 .

(12)

Eqn. 5 is not used for the formation of Rh2 clus-
ter, as the experiments were carried out using Y–
supported Rh(C2H4)2 clusters. [36] Computation of
∆Gcf for Eqn. 12 was performed in the same fash-
ion as explained above.

A negative ∆Gcf for the formation of a proto-
nated Rhn+1 cluster indicates that its formation
from the parent Rhn cluster and Rh(C2H4)2 (either
through Eqn. 5 or Eqn. 12) is thermodynamically
favored. Moreover, comparison of ∆Gcf for RhnHm
clusters with varying m will help in identifying the
thermodynamically most stable protonation of the
supported Rhn cluster.
In order to model

the Y–zeolite a 2×2×2
(Si1536O3072) supercell was taken in our calcula-
tions. The initial coordinates were generated from
the zeolite database. [56] The bulk structure was ﬁrst
optimized at the MM level, [28] and the optimized
structure was used for QM/MM calculations.

5

A T25 site of zeolite (87 atoms) with adsorbate
was treated using QM within a cubic QM box of
side 23.27 ˚A. One of the Si atoms in the center of
the QM region was replaced by an Al atom. The
total charge of the zeolite framework is balanced by
protonating one of the oxygen atoms coordinated to
the substituted Al. Spin polarized calculations were
carried out for supported Rh clusters. Multiplicity
of the QM wavefunction for various supported Rh
clusters studied here are listed in the Supporting
Information. The total charge of the QM and the
MM regions were always zero in these calculations.
For these computations Grimme’s [57] dispersion
correction was used together with the PBE density
functional. All the other computational details are
the same as that in Sections 2.3 and 2.4.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Testing the Implementation of CPMD/GULP

QM/MM Interface

To validate the implementation, Car–Parrinello
MD simulation in the N V E ensemble was carried
out for the 1×1×1 FAU zeolite (Si192O384). Total
energy conservation is a very critical test for the
implementation, especially to check if the energy
and the force components from diﬀerent parts of
the code have been accounted correctly. Further, a
stable dynamics of orbitals can be also tested, by
monitoring the ﬁctitious orbital kinetic energy dur-
ing the dynamics. The drift in total energy was
about 10−6 a. u. ps−1 per atom, which is very
small, indicating that the implementation is work-
ing correctly; see Fig. 2. Also, the ﬁctitious or-
bital kinetic energy ﬂuctuation is not showing any
drift (especially in the absence of a thermostat on
these degrees of freedom), implicating a stable Car–
Parrinello dynamics.

The parallel performance of the code was ana-
lyzed based on the average clock time per MD step
by changing the number of (computing) cores for
MPI tasks allocated to CPMD and GULP. The
clock time also included the whole I/O tasks and all
the communications within and between the MM
and the QM cores. By ﬁxing the number of MM
cores to 8, we changed the number of QM cores as
2n, n = 3, · · · , 6 to verify the CPMD scaling. Sim-
ilarly, to analyze the GULP scaling for the same
QM/MM system, we ﬁxed the number of QM cores
to 32, and varied the MM cores as 2n, n = 0, · · · , 5.

For CPMD and GULP scaling tests, N 0
core was 8
cores and 1 core, respectively. CPMD scales upto
69 % (with respect to 8 cores) using 64 cores, while
GULP scales up to 73 % (with respect to 1 core)
using 32 cores Fig. 3, indicating a very good scaling
performance if a large QM/MM system has to be
treated. Note that the computational time for the
QM–MM electrostatics is accounted together with
the CPMD time. Such a dual parallelization will al-
low to scale down the total computational time per
MD step by increasing the number of QM or MM
cores, as appropriate for a given system and avail-
able computing resources. This is demonstrated in
Fig. 3c where using 32 cores for CPMD and 1 core
for GULP has a clock time of about 60 s per MD
step. Here, CPMD required only about 9 s per MD
step, while GULP required 60 s per MD step, thus
MM force calculations become the bottleneck in the
QM/MM calculations using 32+1 computing cores.
Total clock time can be systematically decreased by
increasing the number of MM cores: with 32 MM

3.2. Neutral oxygen vacancy in α–Cristobalite

At ﬁrst, we carried out N V T ensemble simulation
of pure α–Cristobalite at 300 K. The internal struc-
tural parameters of pure SiO2 from fully MM, fully
QM and QM/MM MD calculations are compared
with experimental values in Table 1. The struc-
tural parameters of the inner QM regions of the
QM/MM calculations are in good agreement with
that of the full QM data. Interestingly, the crystal
structural data is better reproduced in fully MM
calculations than in fully QM and QM/MM simu-
lations, although the diﬀerences are not large. It
is worth noting that near the QM/MM boundary,
the structural parameters of the QM/MM atoms
are deviated more from the fully QM data; see
Supporting Information. This is expected due to
the ﬁnite boundary between QM and MM regions.
Thus, when using the QM/MM interface, we make
sure that the chemically complex region is far from
the boundary, in this case, beyond the ﬁrst nearest
neighboring tetrahedral site.

The vacancy formation energies ∆Ef

for α–
cristobalite computed from fully QM calculations
are tabulated in Table 2. The converged defect for-
mation energy is 7.49 eV. The Si–Si distance (rSiSi)
of the Si–Si bond that is formed due to the defect
is also given in Table 2, and the converged value
is 2.39 ˚A. ∆Ef and rSiSi computed from QM/MM
calculations are given in Table 2 varying the size of
the QM subsystem.

not result in a systematic convergence, which could
arise in a QM/MM calculation as the QM–MM in-
teractions do not vary systematically with increas-
ing QM size due to increasing boundary size (i.e.
increasing number of QM–MM bond cuts). Such
a behavior is also seen in Refs. [22,59] Thus, for e.g.
taking energy diﬀerences between QM/MM systems
of diﬀerent QM sizes shall be done with care. It may
be noted that rSiSi is overestimated in QM/MM ge-
ometry optimizations which could be due to ﬁxed
SiQM–OQM–HcapH–SiMM boundary atoms and MM
atoms in these calculations to speed up the conver-
gence. In the following we have computed the en-
semble average of rSiSi from MD simulations where
all the atoms are relaxed and the agreement with
fully QM data is improved.

As next, we carried out N V T ensemble simula-
tions at 300 K for a QM (3×3 × 3 supercell) and
QM/MM calculations (with 14 T QM size). Dis-
tribution of rSiSi obtained form these simulations is

given in Fig. 4), where it is observed that the aver-
age and the standard deviation of the QM and the
QM/MM distributions diﬀer only by 0.03 ˚A, and
0.01 ˚A, respectively.

From fully QM and QM/MM MD simulations, vi-
brational density of states (VDOS) was computed
from the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation
for the Si–Si bond distance; see Fig. 5. Main fea-
tures of the VDOS are reproduced in QM/MM cal-
culations. The full VDOS of O3Si–SiO3 unit also
agrees qualitatively well within 50 cm−1 (see Sup-
porting Information).

We have also compared the total density of the
Kohn-Sham electronic states (e-DOS) of all the oc-
cupied molecular orbitals; see Fig. 6. There is a
qualitative agreement between the two data, espe-
cially the valence states, reﬂecting the reliability of
the implementation. We do not notice the presence
of any arbitrary electronic states, which would be
otherwise noticeable in the e-DOS. A decreased rel-
ative density for some of the semi-core states could
be due to small QM size compared to the fully QM

calculation.

3.3. Study of Y–Zeolite Supported Rhn (n = 2 − 6)

Clusters

Here we investigate the stable structures of hy-
drogenated Rhn clusters on Y–zeolite, and their for-
mation free energies are computed as a function of
T and at some ﬁxed p.

The structure of Rh(C2H4)2/Y at two diﬀerent
adsorption sites 4R and 6R (see Fig. 7) were ﬁrst
analyzed and compared with the available experi-
mental data. The Rh atom coordinates to two of
the zeolite O atoms and both the ethylene ligands
are π-bonded to the metal atom in the adsorbed
structure. We ﬁnd that metal complex is more sta-
ble at the 4R site by 14 kJ mol−1 than at the 6R
site. The interatomic distances of the optimized
structure are given in Table 3. This structural
data agrees reasonably well with the experimental
data. [60] Interestingly, the 6R adsorption structure

At 300 K and
pH2=pC2H6 =1.0 bar pressure, thermodynamically
the most stable cluster is Rh2H5 (i.e. with the
lowest ∆Gcf value) for n = 2. At higher T , the
clusters with less number of H atoms become more
stabilized, as shown in Fig. 8a.

Similar studies were also carried out for RhnHm
for n = 3 − 6, and same conclusions can be drawn
from these data (Fig. 8b-e). For all the cases,
the thermodynamically stable state at 300 K and
pH2=pC2H6 =1.0 bar pressure, has m = 2n + 1. An-
other crucial information from these plots is that
∆Gcf values of all the clusters are negative at ambi-
ent condition, showing that these clusters can spon-
taneously form from their parent clusters (at the
thermodynamic limit).

The equilibrium structural details and relative
energies of various structures of RhnH2n+1 clusters
adsorbed at 4R and 6R sites are given in the Table
4. Minimum energy conﬁgurations are displayed
in Fig. 9; see also Supporting Information. The
Rh2H5 and Rh3H7 clusters are more stable at 4R
sites than 6R sites, whereas the Rh4H9, Rh5H11
and Rh6H13 are more stable in 6R sites. The av-
erage Rh–Rh distances increase with cluster size
and number of hydrogen atoms. The average Rh–
O distances vary 2.22–2.35 ˚A, and no systematic
variation was observed with increasing cluster size.
Overall, our prediction of the protonation states of
the supported Rhn clusters also agree with the re-
sult of Markova et. al. [43]

Finally, we analyze the structure of the supported
clusters from QM/MM MD simulation at 300 K.
The Rh–Rh bond distance distribution from these
simulations for RhnH2n+1, n = 2 − 6 are given in
Fig. 10. The protonated Rh2 cluster is coordi-
nated to four support oxygen atoms, with two Rh–
O bonds per Rh atom; see Fig. 9. Rh3 forms a
distorted triangle, with two Rh atoms directly in-

agrees better with the experimental data compared
to the 4R adsorption structure.

Now we compute the ∆Gcf for RhnHm/Y, n =
2 − 6, based on which we identify the most stable
protonated structure of a cluster adsorbed within
Y–zeolite. The vibrational entropy, S at 300 K of
zeolite–HY nearly converges to 12.70 J mol−1 K−1
after 6 ps of the simulation; see Supporting Infor-
mation. The converged entropies of Rh(C2H4)2/Y,
Rh3H7/Y and Rh4H9/Y are given in
Table
5. Thus, we ﬁnd that the entropy contribution
(T ∆Scf(T )) to the ∆Gcf of formation Rh4H9/Y
from Rh3H7/Y is negligible. Thus, we ignore the
entropic terms in computing ∆Gcf for other sup-
ported clusters in this study.

teracting with the support oxygen atoms similar to
the case of Rh2. All the three Rh–Rh bond distri-
butions have diﬀerent averages. Rh1–Rh3 bond is
weaker than the other two bonds, because both Rh1
and Rh3 have more terminal hydrogen atoms com-
pared to Rh2. The protonated Rh4 cluster, which
preferentially adsorb at the 6R site, has a distorted
tetrahedral structure with three Rh atoms directly
coordinating to support oxygen atoms. The bond
distributions functions are largely localized between
2.5–3.0 ˚A, and are broader than the Rh3 case. Es-
pecially, the some of the bonds made by Rh4 atom
become nearly dissociated (∼ 2.9 ˚A) as it is co-
ordinated to more number of hydrogen atoms. A
highly distorted pyramidal structure was observed
for the protonated Rh5 cluster at the preferred 6R
site. Similar to Rh4, three Rh atoms are directly
coordinating to support oxygen atoms. One of the
bonds, Rh1–Rh5, was mostly found broken during
the simulation, which is obvious from the broad-
ness of its distribution and its average going be-
yond 3 ˚A. The Rh3–Rh4 and Rh3–Rh1 bonds in
Rh5 cluster are more stronger than the other Rh–
Rh bonds, as clear from their distributions which
are having smaller standard deviations and smaller
average values compared to other bonds. We as-
cribe this to the fact that more number of hydro-
gen atoms are coordinated to Rh3 atom compared
to other Rh atoms in the cluster. Rh6 is adsorbed
at the 6R site, and has a distorted octahedral struc-
ture. The bond length distributions of Rh6 cluster
are more complex. Clearly, no covalent bond ex-
ists between Rh1–Rh2, Rh2–Rh3, and Rh1–Rh4 as
their bond distances are lying above 3 ˚A. Rh5–Rh6,
and Rh4–Rh6 bonds were broken and formed nu-
merous times during the MD simulation.

4. Conclusions

We

have

the
of
reported
CPMD/GULP interface
for hybrid QM/MM
MD simulation of periodic solids and surfaces. The

development

whole QM and MM subsystems can be relaxed dur-
ing geometry optimizations and MD simulations.
The developed program is shown to have good
total energy conservation during MD simulations
and stable ﬁctitious dynamics of orbital degrees
of freedom were observed during a microcanonical
ensemble Car–Parrinello MD simulation of a
Y–zeolite system, manifesting the correctness of
the implementation. Both CPMD and GULP pro-
grams can carry out force–evaluations in parallel
under the same MPI environment, and is shown to
be beneﬁcial for treating large systems.

The QM/MM interface program was further
tested by studying the neutral oxygen vacancy in
α-cristobalite. A reasonable agreement of the com-
puted structural, dynamic and electronic properties
from a fully QM simulation and QM/MM simula-
tion was observed. The vacancy formation energy
is also reproduced well, although a systematic con-
vergence with increasing QM size was not observed.

Structure of protonated Rhn clusters supported
in Y–zeolite was subsequently investigated. Free
energy of formation of Y–zeolite supported pro-
tonated Rhn clusters from protonated Rhn−1 and
Rh2(C2H4)2 at hydrogen atmosphere was com-
puted for various temperature and at given partial
pressures of H2 and C2H6. We ﬁnd that RhnHm
clusters with m = 2n+1 are favorable at low T than
m < 2n+1, while the clusters with less number of H
atoms become increasingly stabilized with increase
in T . Our results are in qualitative agreement with
a previous theoretical work. The thermodynami-
cally stable Y–zeolite supported RhnH2n+1 clusters
at 300 K was further studied using constant temper-
ature MD simulation at 300 K and their structural
properties are reported here.

The developed CPMD/GULP QM/MM interface
program is suited for studying complex catalytic
reactions by carrying out enhanced sampling MD
simulations. In particular, the interface allows us to
perform Car–Parrinello based metadynamics simu-
lations of catalytic reactions, which is advantageous
in studying supported metal catalysis. Such appli-
cations using the QM/MM interface are ongoing in
our laboratory.
