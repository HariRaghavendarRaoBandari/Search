Abstract

We calculate particle production during inﬂation and in the early stages of reheating after inﬂation
in models with a charged scalar ﬁeld coupled to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds. A detailed
analysis of the power spectra of primordial electric ﬁelds, magnetic ﬁelds and charge ﬂuctuations
at the end of inﬂation and preheating is provided. We carefully account for the Gauss constraints
during inﬂation and preheating, and clarify the role of the longitudinal components of the electric
ﬁeld. We calculate the timescale for the back-reaction of the produced gauge ﬁelds on the inﬂaton
condensate, marking the onset of non-linear evolution of the ﬁelds. We provide a prescription for
initial conditions for lattice simulations necessary to capture the subsequent nonlinear dynamics.
On the observational side, we ﬁnd that the primordial magnetic ﬁelds generated are too small to
explain the origin of magnetic ﬁelds on galactic scales and the charge ﬂuctuations are well within
observational bounds for the models considered in this paper.

1 Introduction

Particle production during inﬂation [1–4] and reheating [5–12] sets up the initial conditions for
the formation of observed structure and the beginning of the hot big bang. Particle production
in models with gauge ﬁelds is particularly interesting because of the ubiquity of gauge ﬁelds in
the Standard Model (SM) and their natural appearance in extensions beyond the SM. Gauge
ﬁelds coupled to scalar ﬁelds can have important consequences for the generation of curvature
[13–35] and charge perturbations [35–41], gravitational waves [30, 32, 42–46] as well as seeding
primordial magnetic ﬁelds [37, 47–59] during inﬂation. Such gauge ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the transition to a radiation dominated universe after inﬂation [60, 61] and can lead to novel
non-perturbative phenomena [62–69].

An analysis of particle production with gauge ﬁelds in the early universe has been under-
taken in many previous studies. For example, gauge ﬁeld production during inﬂation and its
consequences was reviewed in [70]. Non-perturbative gauge ﬁeld production during and after
inﬂation was explored in [35, 71–80], whereas nonlinear dynamics of gauge ﬁelds after inﬂation
was considered in (for e.g.) [60, 61, 67, 81, 82] for Abelian ﬁelds and [62–66, 68] for non-Abelian
ones.

In this paper we re-visit particle production in locally gauge invariant models with Abelian and
non-Abelian ﬁelds coupled to charged scalar ﬁelds. In these models we assume that a component
of the charged scalar ﬁeld plays the role of the inﬂaton condensate. Care has to be taken with
gauge ﬁelds because they have to satisfy certain constraint equations (along with the usual
evolution equations). The natural gauge redundancy can lead to complications in quantization
or to spurious gauge modes during numerical evolution. The non-zero vacuum expectation value
(vev) of the inﬂaton condesate during inﬂation and reheating changes some of the common results
for gauge ﬁelds coupled to scalar ﬁelds with zero vevs. Moreover, certain common gauge choices
become ill deﬁned when the inﬂaton condensate starts oscillating at the end of inﬂation. Finally,
if signiﬁcant particle production occurs, back-reaction becomes important and classical lattice
simulations are needed to fully explore the nonlinear dynamics of the ﬁelds. Initial conditions
for such lattice simulations can be nontrivial because of the constraints on the diﬀerent variables
that must be satisﬁed. We pay special attention to all of these issues in this work. While we
restrict ourselves to “minimal” models consistent with local gauge invariance, our techniques and
results should carry over to more complicated scenarios such as [75, 76].

We calculate particle production during inﬂation using gauge invariant variables and with
proper accounting for the constraints (Section 3). The use of gauge invariant variables naturally
avoids issues with spurious gauge degrees of freedom and makes the quantization and subsequent
evolution of perturbations particularly transparent. We provide power spectra for the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds at the end of inﬂation, along with simple analytic estimate for their shape.
In Appendix A we explain their shape via approximate analytic calculations.

While useful during inﬂation, gauge invariant variables become ill deﬁned when the inﬂaton
starts oscillating. We argue for the use of well deﬁned Coulumb gauge variables for analysing non-
perturbative particle production during preheating at the end of inﬂation. In Section 4, we carry
out a Floquet like analysis for the resonant production of the gauge ﬁelds. Here, we point out some
minor discrepancies in the literature regarding the productions of the gauge invariant longitudinal

2

component of the electric ﬁeld. We then estimate the end of preheating by calculating the time
when back-reaction of the resonantly produced gauge ﬁelds becomes important (Section 4.2). In
Appendix B we provide technical details for quantizing and calculating the back-reaction in the
Coulomb gauge.

Once nonlinear eﬀects become important, simulations become essential. Nonlinear simulations
with gauge ﬁelds (especially non-Abelian ﬁelds) can be challenging because of the large number
of components and the necessity of satisfying constraint equations. In Section 5 of this work we
provide a simple prescription for setting up initial conditions for such lattice simulations which
can be applied in any gauge. In our prescription, the lattice initial conditions naturally satisfy
the necessary gauge constraints. We note that our initial conditions accurately account for metric
perturbations, ﬁeld interactions and gauge constraints to linear order. We provide an example of
lattice initial conditions in temporal gauge which is a common choice for simulations. We arrive
at these initial conditions via gauge invariant variables; this serves as a model to set up initial
conditions in any gauge. We will carry out actual lattice simulations in future work.

We have tried to make the paper self-contained, so that it can be used for future reference
easily. To this end, we provide the necessary equations for the perturbations of metric and matter
ﬁelds (scalar and gauge ﬁelds) in position and Fourier space for gauge invariant variables. While
we work with gauge invariant variables as far as possible, we also provide a dictionary to translate
our results to other popular gauges.

For pedagogical purposes, we carry out the analysis for Abelian ﬁelds ﬁrst (Section 2). We
show in the later half of the paper (Section 6) how the non-Abelian analysis can be reduced to
an analysis of multiple copies of the Abelian case in the linear regime. Hence, the analysis for
the Abelian case, including the setting up of the lattice initial conditions, can be easily carried
over to the non-Abelian case. We show how to apply the developed techniques to a SU (2) model
and its extension: a SU (2) × U (1) model.

We discuss the observational consequences of a charged inﬂaton and its gauge ﬁelds in Section

7. We summarize our results in the Conclusions section and discuss future directions.

where α(xν) is an arbitrary real function of space and time. The total action is also invariant
under space-time diﬀeromorphisms. The gauge symmetry implies that not all of the components
of the 4-vector Aµ and the real and imaginary parts of the scalar ﬁeld are physical degrees of
freedom (dof). We remedy this redundancy by working in the appropriate set of gauge invariant
variables or by ﬁxing the gauge. The redundancy due to space-time diﬀeomorphisms is handled
in a similar fashion.

We will present our answers as power spectra of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which are

deﬁned in the usual way [83]:1

Under the local U (1) gauge transformation (see eq. (2.4)) ρ → ρ and Ω → Ω− α. It is convenient

when working with gauge invariant variables.

2.2 Diﬀeomorphism invariants

We will work in a perturbed Friedmann-Roberston-Walker space-time with the metric:

In these variables the matter action becomes

√−g

(cid:16) gAρ

(cid:17)2

(cid:105)

where φ(xσ), B(xσ), ψ(xσ), E(xσ) are scalar perturbations, Si(xσ), Ki(xσ) are divergence-free
3-vector perturbations, and ˜hij(xσ) is a traceless transverse 3-tensor perturbation.

In this perturbed space-time, we deﬁne the perturbations of the following U (1) invariant

(cid:104)

ρ(xµ) = ¯ρ(τ ) + δρ(xµ) ,
(cid:107)

G0(xµ), ∂iG

variables:

where G0(xσ) and G(cid:107)(xσ) are scalars and G⊥
i (xσ) is a divergence-free 3-vector. Note that the
gauge ﬁelds vanish at the background level: the spatial components are zero from isotropy of
the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background and the equations of motion will set the
background temporal component to zero. Hence we will work at the linear level in Gµ.

For our scenario, there are two physical scalar metric perturbations, with scalar ﬁeld perturba-
tion and scalar parts of the gauge ﬁeld adding three more. We choose to work with the following
ﬁve diﬀeomorphism invariant combinations:
Φ = φ − 1

Ψ = ψ + H (B − ∂τE) ,

where H = ∂τ ln a. The ﬁrst two are the standard Bardeen variables. G0 and G(cid:107) are diﬀeomor-
phism invariant since the gauge ﬁeld vanishes at the background level.

Similarly, for the vectors we chose to work with the following diﬀeomorphism invariant com-

binations

where ˜V and G⊥ are divergence free.

˜Vi ≡ Si − ∂τKi ,

(2.13)

The traceless, transverse 3-tensor perturbation ˜hij is already diﬀeomorphism invariant. Sim-
ilarly, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned in eq. (2.9) are already diﬀeomorphism invariant.
It is convenient to split the electric and magnetic ﬁelds into divergence-free and curl-free parts

Next, we write down the equation of motion for the background (space independent) ﬁelds and
linearized perturbations around these background ﬁelds in terms of gauge invariant variables.

2.3.1 Background

Assuming the scalar ﬁeld plays the role of the inﬂaton and treating the gauge ﬁelds as perturba-
tions, the evolution of ¯ρ(τ ) can be determined from eq. (2.17):

τ ¯ρ + 2H∂τ ¯ρ + a2 ∂V

where H is given by the 00 background Einstein equation

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds vanish at the background level.

2.3.2 Linearized perturbations in position space

From eq. (2.17) and eq. (2.18) we get the equations of motion for diﬀeomorphism and U (1) gauge
invariant scalar perturbations:

where eq. (2.26) is the linearized version of the Gauss constraint. Note that the scalar components
of the gauge ﬁelds G0 and G(cid:107) do not depend on the metric perturbations.

(2.27)

The perturbations G⊥
i do not couple to metric perturbations. As mentioned earlier, the tensor
perturbations are also decoupled from the matter ﬁelds at the linear level. We shall not consider
tensor perturbations any further in this paper.

We now turn to the Einstein equations. The energy-momentum tensor in eq. (2.19) is quadratic
in the Gµ (with Gµ = 0 at the background level). Hence, to linear order in the perturbations, the
energy-momentum tensor depends only on the perturbations in ρ and the metric. Also T i
j = 0 for
i (cid:54)= j; there is no anisotropic stress. The linearised Einstein equations (for scalar perturbations)
yield

Φ = Ψ ,

Note that the gauge ﬁelds are completely decoupled from the scalar metric perturbations.

The picture for vector perturbations is even simpler - the linearized Einstein equations for the

vector perturbations involve only metric perturbations:

(2.29)

which do not aﬀect the matter vector perturbations.

At the linearized level, the equations of motion for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned in

eq. (2.9) are simple2

2.3.3 Linearized perturbations in Fourier space

For calculational purposes, we move to Fourier space. Fourier space is also particularly convenient
for solving the various constraint equations, which essentially become algebraic in the relevant

variables. Our Fourier convention is f (x , τ ) =(cid:82) fk (τ )eik·x d3k .

We begin with the equations of motion for the scalar perturbations. From the (Fourier space
version of the) constraints, eqns. (2.28), we can substitute the gravitational potential Ψk and its
derivative into the evolution equation for δ ˜ρk (cf. eq. (2.24)) to obtain an equation of motion
which only involves δ ˜ρk :

The remaining scalar perturbations, G0 and G(cid:107), are governed again by an evolution equation,
eq. (2.25), and a constraint, eq. (2.26). Before moving to the Fourier transformed versions of
these equations we deﬁne the longitudinal (i.e. curl free) component of the space-like part of Gµ:

i = ∂iG

(cid:107)

The Fourier transform of GL can be expressed in terms of a longitudinal polarisation vector, L

as follows:

determined by a constraint equation. Substituting the auxiliary ﬁeld (i.e. G0k ) into the equation
of motion we obtain the following expression in terms of GL

The fact that Hubble friction does not appear in the evolution equations for the transverse modes
is because of conformal invariance of massless gauge ﬁelds. However, the longitudinal components
(which exist when the gauge ﬁeld is eﬀectively massive) do feel Hubble friction.

One can also rewrite the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and the 3-current current, in terms of

longitudinal and transverse modes, e.g.

The ﬁrst identity is simply −kEL

analysis of the perturbations during and after inﬂation, one cannot set j0k and jL
k to zero by
hand (this diﬀers from the treatment in [54], [84]). This is because the vacuum ﬂuctuations in
GL
k can be enhanced due to horizon crossing during inﬂation or non-adiabatic particle production
during preheating. We shall see this aspect in detail in the subsequent sections.

2.4 Gauge transformations

In the upcoming sections we will use either the gauge invariant variables discussed above or work
in some particular gauge depending on which approach is best for the problem at hand. In this

9

short section we provide the relationships between variables in some of the popular gauges used
in the literature and the gauge invariant ones. These relationships can also be used to move
from one gauge to another. When the variables are well deﬁned, we can use the equations of
motion and the solutions in the gauge invariant case to recover the corresponding expressions in
our gauge of choice. Occasionally, some of the variables become ill deﬁned or the relationships
between variables require a patching up of co-ordinate maps (for example during reheating). Such
cases can be dealt with on an individual basis, or one simply derives the equations of motion and
solutions directly from the equations of motion themselves.

√

In diﬀerent gauges (but not the gauge invariant case) the complex scalar ﬁeld is represented as
ϕ = (ϕ0 + iϕ1)/
2, and the gauge ﬁelds by Aµ. For perturbations, we will always work around
an FRW background. Using the global U (1) invariance, we set the homogeneous, imaginary part
2. For the homogeneous part ¯ϕ0 = ±ρ with the ±
of ϕ, ¯ϕ1 = 0. That is ϕ = ( ¯ϕ0 + δϕ0 + iδϕ1)/
sign accounting for the change in sign during an oscillation through zero. In Fourier space, the
transverse modes and the scalar perturbations along the direction of motion of the homogeneous
ﬁeld (in all the gauges discussed below) are related to the gauge invariant variables as follows:

k = 0, and the equation governing

only if we can set the complementary solution to zero. This can always be done since there
is a residual degree of freedom χ such that under the transformations Aµ → Aµ + ∇µχ and
δϕ1 → δϕ1 − ¯ϕ0gAχ/2, the theory remains invariant; provided χ obeys ∇µ∇µχ = 0. In Fourier
space we get Lτ χk = 0. Since the operator evolving χk is identical to the one evolving AL
k , we
can always choose χk such that the complementary part of AL
k vanishes, thus arriving at the
particular solution provided above.

3 Inﬂationary dynamics

The background dynamics are relatively straightforward during inﬂation. At the phenomeno-
logical level, with an appropriate choice of the potential V and initial conditions we can easily
arrange for −∂tH/H 2 = −a∂τ (H/a)/H2 (cid:28) 1 for suﬃcient number of e-folds. For simple models,
this corresponds to H = (H/a) ≈ const and ¯ρ ≈ const during inﬂation. Inﬂation ends when
∂τH = 0, when accelerated expansion stops and the ﬁeld starts rolling quickly. Assuming such a
background solution has been found, we focus on the quantum ﬂuctuations around this classical
background. Quantization of constrained systems, like the problem at hand, can be tricky. We
ﬁnd that by working in Fourier space with gauge invariant variables and substituting the con-
straints before quantizing, the process becomes straightforward. Once the appropriate quantized
solutions for the scalar and gauge ﬁelds are available, we construct the power spectra of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the end of inﬂation.

3.1 Quantized scalar and vector perturbations

For the purposes of quantization, it is convenient to write down the action for the Fourier com-
ponents of the dynamical perturbation variables left after imposing the constraints. The equa-
tions of motion for these variables δ ˜ρk , GL
k were provided in the previous section (see
eqns. (2.31), (2.37) and (2.40)). The total quadratic action of these variables naturally splits into
four parts:

The ﬁnal ingredient needed for evolving the mode function uI

determine the commutation relation for the operators ˆaI
k . We will determine the initial conditions
by constructing WKB solutions for the mode functions satisfying eq. (3.7) at very early times.

To proceed to the WKB solutions for the initial conditions we need the explicit forms of

bI (k, τ ) and ωI (k, τ ), which are provided below. For I = ρ, i.e. when f ρ

One can check that extremising the action in eq. (3.1) with respect to each of the ﬁeld perturba-
tions gives the corresponding equations of motion from the previous section, namely eqns. (2.31),
(2.37) and (2.40).
At early enough times during inﬂation as a → 0, a given k mode of interest will be deep
inside the horizon k (cid:29) H and will dominate all other physical scales (for example, k (cid:29) (¯ρgAa))
as a → 0. At such early enough times during inﬂation ∂2

Since these operators are time-independent, these relationships remain true at all times. Thus by
starting with the initial conditions for the mode functions uI
k in (3.10), we can evolve them using
eq. (3.7) to any later time and obtain the necessary power spectra. The forward time evolution
will take the initially sub-horizon and/or ultra-relativistic (k (cid:29) H and/or k (cid:29) ¯ρgAa) solutions
to superhorizon and non-relativistic ones.

The early time solution for the mode function uρ
k of δ ˆ˜ρk reﬂects the fact that at early enough
times, we are simply dealing with an eﬀectively massless (k (cid:29) a2∂ρV ) ﬁeld on subhorizon k (cid:29) H
scales where metric perturbations are negligible. The early time solution is identical to the mode
functions for the Minkowski vacuum apart from the trivial a(τ ) scaling. The mode function uL

The rescaled ﬁeld (¯ρgA/2k) ˆGL
k behaves as a massless scalar ﬁeld, which is a manifestation of
the Goldstone Boson Equivalence Theorem. The scalefactor does not appear in the early time
modefunctions uT±
of the transverse gauge ﬁeld modes ˆGT±
. This reﬂects the fact that massless

transverse modes of gauge ﬁelds are conformally invariant.

Finally, we note that the above early solutions were constructed assuming slow roll inﬂation.
However, for large enough k these solutions remain valid even at the end of inﬂation as is to be
expected, albeit with slightly diﬀerent conditions on k. The conditions for these solutions to be
valid are k (cid:29) H, a2∂2

Inﬂationary power spectra

Let us now use the developed formalism to compute the power spectra of the matter ﬁelds at the
end of inﬂation - the ﬁrst moment when ∂τH = 0.4 We will calculate the power spectra of the
gauge invariant electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The correlation functions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be written in terms of the

longitudinal and transverse mode functions as follows:

For concreteness, we compute these power spectra at the end of inﬂation for the chaotic inﬂation
scenario with V (ρ) = (1/2)m2ρ2. However, our results hold more generally. For an analytic un-
derstanding of the features in the power spectra we solve the equations of motion in de Sitter space
to zeroth order in slow-roll (i.e. we ignore time derivatives of the inﬂaton) in the Appendix A.
We assume that inﬂation lasts 60 e-folds and take the inﬂaton mass to be m = 10−6 mPl. The
longitudinal and transverse ﬁelds, ˆGL
are evolved numerically from very early times

when they are deep inside the horizon with k (cid:29) H, k (cid:29) a¯ρgA/2 and k2 (cid:29) (cid:12)(cid:12)∂2

5The two transverse modes would have diﬀerent power spectra if there was axion coupling which we do not
consider here. The way we have split the transverse modes into states ± with well-deﬁned helisities makes our
analysis easily extendible to the case of charged Higgs with an additional axion-like interaction.

The power spectra of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the end of inﬂation are shown in Fig. 1.
To understand these plots, a ‘Compton wavenumber’ kC corresponding to the eﬀective mass is
particularly important:

kC ≡ a¯ρgA/2 ,

where the time dependent quantities on the righthand side are all evaluated at the time of interest
(usually at the end of inﬂation). The spectra behave diﬀerently based on the relative size of kC
and the Hubble scale H. When the Compton wavenumber of ˆGL

suppression of kC /H is unexpected, at least if one looks at the equation of motion of ˆGT±

eq. (2.40). For the interested reader, we explain this in Appendix A. Also note that in this
regime ∆2
BT± is a single power-law, given by deep subhorizon Minkowskian power spectrum. For
0.1 < kC /H < 1 there is a crossover behaviour from a double power-law of the kC (cid:29) H regime
to the single power-law of kC (cid:28) H. The power spectrum for the longitudinal component of the
electric ﬁeld ∆2
EL exhibits a power excess on super-Hubble scales, with the correction factor found
numerically to be 1 < Tk < 2 at the end of inﬂation. On super-Compton scales, k < kC , Tk ≈ 2.
We also do not see any features in the range kC < k < H in ∆2
EL because the k-dependent pre-
factor multiplying ∂τ ˆGL
k , eq. (2.43), cancels the additional k-dependence.

the inﬂaton condensate. Power spectra at the end of inﬂation ignoring the eﬀects of expansion (dashed
lines) are shown for comparison. We show three diﬀerent spectra: the longitudinal electric ﬁeld, ∆2
EL
(green), transverse electric ﬁeld, ∆2
BT ± (orange). The mode functions
of the ﬁelds responsible for these spectra can have two distinct forms depending on the magnitude of the
scale kC ≡ a¯ρgA /2 where ¯ρ is the magnitude of the inﬂaton ﬁeld at the end of inﬂation. For the upper
row with kC
ET ± (black) is
a double power-law with a break k ∼ kC (kC /H). For the lower row with kC
(cid:38) H, all three power spectra
have double power-law forms, with a break at k ∼ kC . Note that one can also use these plots to read-oﬀ
the power spectrum of the charge density, ∆2
EL. More detailed expressions for the spectra
are provided in eqns. (3.19) and (3.20). An analysis of these spectra in de Sitter space (which explains the
diﬀerent power-laws) is provided in Appendix A. Note that the Hubble parameter H (and its conformal
counterpart H) at the end of inﬂation was used to make the relevant quantities dimensionless on the
horizontal and vertical axes.

Note that Tk is time dependent and Tk → 1 in de Sitter space-time (see Appendix A for the
evaluation of the power spectra in de Sitter space-time). The deviation of Tk from 1 is observed
towards the end of inﬂation. It is thus important to solve for the mode functions in a background
that deviates from de Sitter in order to capture this eﬀect and obtain the correct power spectra
at the end of inﬂation.

We also give the power spectra calculated under the assumption that H = 0 and ¯ρ = const
(hence kC = const), cf. dashed lines in Fig. 1. These are ‘quasi-Minkowski’ conditions in the

functions and obtain the following expressions for the power for electric and magnetic ﬁelds:

When kC (cid:28) H expansion is important for superhorizon modes k < H. However, if kC ≥ H
the eﬀects due to expansion are negligible and eq. (3.21) is a good approximation to the power
spectrum in the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

4 Preheating dynamics

At the end of inﬂation the inﬂaton ﬁeld begins to oscillate around the minimum of its potential.
The linearised equations describing the evolution of the ﬂuctuations in the inﬂaton and gauge
ﬁelds will then contain oscillating terms. Such oscillating terms can lead to an exponential growth
of matter ﬂuctuations. This preheating period begins soon after the end of inﬂation and its end
is marked by the back-reaction of the ﬂuctuations on the inﬂaton condensate and/or the moment
when the linearised analysis of the ﬂuctuations stops being a good approximation [9].

The power spectra of electric and magnetic ﬁeld at the end of the preheating era are shown in
Fig. 2. These spectra are calculated numerically (for quadratic inﬂation) and properly account
for the quantum nature of the ﬁelds, eﬀects of expansion and metric perturbations. A detailed
understanding of these spectra is the main goal of this section. As we will see, calculating these
spectra using gauge invariant variables (and Unitary gauge variables) become somewhat unwieldy
(in particular for the longitudinal components of the gauge ﬁelds). The Coulomb gauge turns out
to be well suited for this calculation.

In Section 4.1, we will use Floquet theory to explore the instabilities in matter perturbations
using gauge invariant variables and gauge dependent variables. In Section 4.2, a Hartree approx-
imation is used to understand the eﬀects of back-reaction on the homogeneous condensate and
quantify a time when preheating ends.

4.1 Floquet analysis

We ignore metric perturbations for the Floquet analysis of the instabilities in the matter per-
turbations. This is a plausible approximation since the vector and tensor metric perturbations
are decoupled from matter anyway, while the scalar metric perturbations are suppressed on sub-
horizon scales. We also ignore expansion at the background level since the universe does not
expand much during the short period of preheating. For notational simplicity we drop quantum
operators from our expressions while carrying out Floquet analysis.6 The linearized equations of

6More explicitly, we could have done the calculation with the mode functions with operators coming along for
the ride rather than notationally using classical Fourier modes of the ﬁelds. However, this gets rather cumbersome.

The boundary between small and large coupling gAmPl/m ≈ 1, can be understood via a Floquet analysis
of the instabilities. A requirement of broad resonance [9], leads to the upper bound on k. The features
in the top row (small couplings) can be also understood in terms of the inﬂaton oscillations. We have
rescaled ∆2
EL by a5 (with a = 1 at the end of inﬂation) to roughly
separate the eﬀects of resonant particle production from the expected red-shifting of the ﬁelds. We also
plot the power spectra before resonant particle production begins i.e. right at the end of inﬂation (dashed
lines) for comparison. For ease of comparison with Fig. 1, H (and its conformal counterpart H) at the end
of inﬂation was used for constructing the relevant dimensionless ratios on the horizontal and vertical axes.
Note that Hbr ≈ 0.25H, that is k/Hbr ≈ 4k/H, so the main features in the lower row are all signiﬁcantly
subhorizon at the time of evaluation.

7From the background equation of motion for ¯ρ near the minimum of V (¯ρ), eq. (2.22), one might infer that ¯ρ
is oscillatory with positive and negative values. This seems apparently at odds with the positive deﬁniteness of
¯ρ as implied by its deﬁnition as a “radial” variable. This is of course a minor inconvenience due to our choice of
“radial” gauge invariant variables and can be understood in terms of a discontinuous jump of the angular variable
at the origin which we have ignored. There is the other issue of the deﬁnition Gµ when ¯ρ = 0, cf. eq. (2.7), though
it remains well deﬁned away from this point.

19

To deal with the singularity, ¯ρ = 0, in the coeﬃcient ∂τ ln bL of ∂τ GL
appearing in eq. (4.1), we make the following change of variables

The Floquet exponents, µL

Only the periodic functions, P L
k±(τ ), are singular (or have ‘spikes’) at the zeroes of ¯ρ, because
of the ˇh(¯ρ(τ )) factor. Importantly, the physical observables: the longitudinal electric ﬁeld EL
k
and the charge and current densities, j0k and jL
k , are immune to the singularities because of the
¯ρ-dependent pre-factors in their deﬁnitions cancel appropriately (cf. eqns. (2.43) and (2.44)).
We note that an identical analysis holds for the Unitary gauge ((cid:61)[ϕ] = 0) as well. In that
k has bL and ωL given in eq. (4.6) with ¯ρ → (cid:60)[ ¯ϕ] (cf.
gauge, the equation of motion for the AL
Section 2.4). Hence AL
k grows exponentially as well with periodic spikes occurring whenever
(cid:60)[ ¯ϕ] = 0. This still leads to spike-free exponential growth of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld and
charge and current densities. We also conﬁrm this result below by carrying out the calculation in
the Coulumb gauge where no singularities are present in the equations of motion. Our conclusion
is diﬀerent from that of [77], where the authors argued that the coeﬃcient, ∂τ ln bL, of the ∂τ AL

resonance in both longitudinal and transverse modes is comparable.

Figure 3. The above ﬁgures show Floquet exponents µk of the transverse (left) and longitudinal (right)
modes of the gauge ﬁelds during preheating as a function of the physical wavenumber k and the scaled
amplitude of the inﬂaton ﬁeld oscillations. The gauge ﬁelds are coupled to an inﬂaton with a coupling
strength gA , and the inﬂaton potential is m2|ϕ|2. Note that there is no qualitative diﬀerence between the
longitudinal and transverse modes. As the universe expands, a rough estimate of the amount of particle
production in a given Fourier mode can be made by ﬂowing across this plot towards the origin along
the white lines (momentum k on the horizontal axis redshifts as a−1 and the inﬂaton ﬁeld amplitude
decays on the vertical axis as ∼ a−3/2). Note that the “local” Floquet exponent µk is large compared to
the instantaneous expansion rate H: (cid:60)[µk]/H ∝ mPl/m in the light colored bands, with mPl/m ∼ 106
from CMB observations. However, whether a given Fourier mode passes through these bands depends on
gA. To see this note that at the beginning of preheating | ¯ϕ| ≈ 0.1mPl, hence gA| ¯ϕ|/m (cid:46) 105gA. Hence,
(cid:46) 10−5, most of the low momentum modes start “below” the lowest resonance bands and never
for gA
experience signiﬁcant growth. For gA (cid:29) 10−5 the unstable momentum modes pass through many Floquet
bands as the universe expands and this can lead to signiﬁcant particle production.

4.1.2 Coulomb gauge analysis

One might be troubled by the presence of singularities in the intermediate steps of the gauge
invariant analysis, especially if one wishes to carry out numerical calculations. In the Coulumb
gauge the calculation of the physical observables EL
k , is ‘clean’ throughout, i.e. no
singularities arise whatsoever in the intermediate steps.

non-singular everywhere. This is an improvement over the gauge invariant analysis. In that case,

Before moving on to back-reaction, let us revisit the features seen in Fig. 2 in light of what we
now understand from our Floquet analysis. The resonance structure of the transverse mode, eq.
(4.5), is identical to that of χ in the popular ˜g2ϕ2χ2 toy model [71]. Making use of well-known
results about this model (see for example [86]), the parametric excitation of transverse modes is
expected to be most eﬃcient in the broad resonance regime gA| ¯ϕ|/m ∼ gAmPl/m (cid:29) 1 for modes

in the range k (cid:46) m(cid:112)gA| ¯ϕ|/m ∼ m(cid:112)gAmPl/m. This should be true for the longitudinal mode
for gAmPl/m (cid:29) 1, the transverse and longitudinal modes in the range k/H (cid:46)(cid:112)
m/H(cid:112)kC /H ∼
(cid:112)kC /H are signiﬁcantly enhanced, in agreement with the analysis of this section (once expansion

as well based on the Floquet plots shown in Fig. 3. The lower three plots in Fig. 2 show how

4.2 Back-reaction and end of preheating

So far we have extensively relied on a linear analysis of perturbations. As we have seen, during
preheating, the covariant derivative coupling between the gauge ﬁelds and the inﬂaton causes
resonant Fourier modes of electric and magnetic ﬁelds to grow exponentially fast. This growth
cannot proceed forever. The resonance is eventually shut-oﬀ by the gauge ﬁeld’s back-reaction
on the oscillating inﬂaton condensate, which ultimately leads to the condensate’s fragmentation
and our linear analysis stops holding any more.

To estimate the time of back-reaction, we shall investigate the eﬀective equation of motion of
the inﬂaton condensate in the Hartree approximation. We shall work in the non-singular Coulomb
gauge, and include the background expansion as well (but ignore metric perturbations). Assuming
that the slow-roll inﬂation happens along the real ¯ϕ0 axis, the eﬀective condensate equation in
the Hartree approximation becomes

During preheating the occupation numbers become much greater than one, and the ﬁelds are
expected to approach the classical limit. In this limit, the commutators of non-commuting vari-
ables vanish and the ambiguity regarding operator ordering is not signiﬁcant. Moreover, note
that the expectation values of non-commuting operators above can be complex. However, taking
the real par is a reasonable approximation since in the classical limit the imaginary part becomes
negligible compared to the real one (we have veriﬁed this numerically as well).

Our next step is to derive expressions for the expectation values in eq. (4.15) in terms of
mode functions for the diﬀerent ﬁelds. In the Coulomb gauge, and in Fourier space, the temporal

With these expressions, we can now calculate back-reaction eﬀects iteratively. We ﬁrst evolve
the mode functions from vacuum initial conditions in eq. (3.13), using the background solution
¯ϕ0 of eq. (4.15) with the correction terms (quadratic in the perturbations) ignored. These then
allow us to get the necessary expectation values explicitly. Next, we re-evaluate the background
solution, now including the correction terms (quadratic in the perturbations) in eq. (4.15). The
moment when the new background solution deviates from the uncorrected one (see the left panel
in Fig. 4) back-reaction has become important. For large couplings, gA > 10−4 in the Chaotic
inﬂation model (V = m2ρ2/2, m = 10−6mPl), we get the following expression for the number
of e-folds of expansion after the end of inlation when gauge ﬁelds back react on the condensate
∆Nbr ≈ 1.72g−0.1
. We caution that this scaling is to be taken as a very rough guide in the range
of 3 × 10−4 < gA < 2.5 × 10−3 (see the right panel in Fig. 4), the true dependence is likely
non monotonic. Below the lowest value of gA we have considered, the Hubble expansion quickly
redshifts all modes below the lowest resonance band and we see negligible gauge ﬁeld production.

5 Initial conditions for lattice simulations

In this section we give a concise description of initial conditions for numerical lattice studies
of reheating. Our linearlized calculations including expansion, metric perturbations and the
quantum nature of the ﬁelds were suﬃcient during inﬂation and preheating. However, after
preheating the dynamics of matter ﬁelds on subhorizon scales can become highly non-linear. Since
(i) the matter ﬁeld occupation numbers grow rapidly during preheating, (ii) predominantly on
subhorizon scales, while (iii) the metric perturbations remain small, one can evolve the classical

the end of inﬂation with no back-reaction (orange) and with back-reaction taken into account (black) for

equations of motion of the matter ﬁelds numerically after preheating using subhorizon 3+1d
lattice simulations including gravity only at the background level. This standard approximation
captures all of the relevant physical phenomena during the non-linear stage of reheating.

There are two distinct parts to setting up initial conditions on the lattice. First, for making
the transition from quantized ﬂuctuations to classical ones in the continuum limit, a prescription
is needed. The classical ﬁeld ﬂuctuations must also satisfy the necessary constraints. The second
is discretizing these initialized continuous ﬁelds on the lattice. We ﬁrst focus on getting from
quantized ﬂuctuations to classical ones, with an accounting for the constraints. We will move
from gauge invariant variables to variables in the temporal gauge (a popular choice of lattice
simulations), but the prescription is applicable in any gauge.

Working in the local U (1) gauge invariant variables, the matter ﬁelds with the quantized
ﬂuctuations at the end of preheating, written in terms of the mode functions in Fourier space
(in the continuum limit) are as follows.
In the expressions below, the time τ is the time of
speciﬁcation of the initial conditions on the lattice (this could be the end of inﬂation or some
time before back-reaction).

aL
k in eq. (5.1) and eq. (5.4) are the same.

So far the analysis have been carried out in a gauge invariant framework. It is not diﬃcult
to ﬁnd the initial conditions for lattice simulations in a particular gauge. For example, in the
A0 = 0 (temporal) gauge - the common gauge choice for numerical simulations, the conversion
between gauge invariant variables and gauge dependent ﬁelds is given in eqns. (2.45) and (2.48).
For convenience one can choose τin = τ in eq. (2.48), so that δϕ1

We note that despite the random nature of the complex numbers in eq. (5.6), the Gaussian
constraint on the lattice is automatically satisﬁed to linear order in the perturbations, since the
expression for G0(x , τ ) in eq. (5.4), in terms of the complex aL
k , takes care of the ﬁrst order terms
in eq. (2.18).

If one wishes the Gauss constraint to be met to machine precision on the lattice, a simple
correction has to be made. After initialising δρ(x , τ ), ∂τ δρ(x , τ ), Gi(x , τ ), ∂τ Gi(x , τ ), G0(x , τ )

mode functions have increased (are occupied) signiﬁcantly [87]. This is not necessarily true for the gauge ﬁelds
at the end of inﬂation. However, if gauge ﬁeld modes are resonantly excited during preheating, the stochastic
approach becomes consistent.

We remind the reader that all expressions so far in this section are for ﬁelds on a continuous
space-time manifold. The reason is transparency of the transition from quantum to classical ﬁelds
accounting for the constraints. For completeness we outline the discrete lattice counterparts to
the continuous variables. Let ∆ be the separation between neighbouring lattice points and L the
length of the lattice. Then the following substitutions should be used to deﬁne the ﬁelds on the

These modiﬁcations hold for the spatial discretization stencil in eq. (5.12). For other stencils one
can derive similar expressions for the orientation of the polarisation vectors. We stress that if
the spatial discretization is not accounted for by the polarization vectors, there will be violation
of the Gauss constraint.

11E.g.

in the standard Wilsonian approach to lattice gauge theories, gauge ﬁelds live on space-time links,
2 ) and scalar ﬁelds live on the nodes of the space-time lattice, ρ(xµ). Here ˆµ is the space-time unit

Gµ(xµ + ˆµ ∆
vector and ∆ is the separation between two neighbouring points on the space-time lattice.

6 The non-Abelian models

We now show that the developed techniques in the previous sections can be used for more compli-
cated non-Abelian models. The main purpose here is to reduce calculations of these complicated
models (as far as possible) to the ones we have carried out in the Abelian case. We shall ﬁrst
consider the case of SU (2) non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds and then extend to SU (2)× U (1), describing
the Electroweak sector of the Standard Model.

We consider the following action for a charged scalar doublet

where the non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds are Aµ = Aa
being the three Pauli matrices. The repeated indices are summed over (both for ﬁeld and space-
time indices).

It is possible to write the above action in terms of local SU (2) invariant ﬁelds (analogous
to the Abelian case). We will show below that these gauge invariant ﬁelds decouple from each
other at the linear level and the problem reduces to three identical copies of the Abelian model.
The quantisation scheme, preheating analysis as well as setting up of lattice initial conditions
discussed in the previous sections then carries over without any diﬃculty.

We begin by writing the scalar doublet as [86]

where ρ will be our real scalar ﬁeld which forms a condensate during inﬂation (e.g. the inﬂaton),
and M is a unitary matrix of unit determinant

(6.5)
This {ρ, Ωa} decomposition is similar to the polar one give in eq. (2.6) for the Abelian model. In
a now familiar way, cf. eq. (2.7), we proceed to deﬁne SU (2) invariant non-Abelian ﬁelds

(6.9)

We will again work at the linear level in Ga
µ, since the arguments for the vanishing backgrounds
of the gauge ﬁelds used in the Abelian model apply to this case as well. The inﬂaton ﬂuctuations
(δρ) are decoupled from the gauge ﬁelds, Ga
µ. Furthermore δρ is the only ﬁeld coupled to the
metric perturbations. At linear order we can ignore the interactions between the gauge bosons,
i.e. the last term in (6.9). Thereby, the three gauge ﬁelds, Ga
µ, are decoupled from each other
and each of them is treated as the gauge ﬁeld from the Abelian model. The quadratic action for
the matter perturbations splits into (cf. eq. (3.1))

I

Each SI is of the general form given in eq. (3.2). The coeﬃcients bρ(k, τ ), ωρ(k, τ ) are those in
eq. (3.8), and baL(k, τ ), ωaL(k, τ ) and baT±(k, τ ), ωaT±(k, τ ) are equal to the longitudinal and
transverse ones in eq. (3.9), respectively. Therefore, the inﬂationary power spectra will be those of
three identical copies of longitudinal modes and six identical copies of transverse modes (i.e. one
longitudinal and two transverse modes per gauge ﬁeld). The quantization procedure is identical
to the Abelian case with no additional subtleties.

The inﬂaton oscillations during preheating again present a problem for the gauge invariant
ﬁelds. The gauge invariant ﬁelds, Ga
µ, are ill-deﬁned when Ωa are ill-deﬁned which happens every
time ϕ = 0. In analogy with the Abelian case, we will work in the Coulomb gauge. In terms of
its “cartesian” components,

the scalar doublet to the Standard Model Higgs ﬁeld, whose hypercharge is −1/2. The action is

SU (2) and U (1) invariant ﬁelds. However, following the standard treatment of the Electroweak
sector of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, we will ﬁx the gauge for the U (1) sector. With
an eye towards the preheating analysis, we will choose Coulomb gauge for the U (1) ﬁelds, where
∂iBi = 0 (in Fourier space, BL
k = 0). In addition, instead of proceeding to quantization and then
to a preheating analysis, we will work with certain linear combinations of G and B ﬁelds to make
contact with the Standard Model. To this end, we deﬁne the charged W bosons as (cf. eq. (6.7))

Notice that only the transverse modes of the photon, A, contribute to the action. The longitudinal
modes of A do not contribute since the photon is massless - a manifestation of the Ward identity.
We can now quantise the transverse modes of A and the longitudinal and transverse modes of Z,
G1, G2 as done in Section 3.1.

We remind the reader that the procedure outlined above is well-deﬁned during inﬂation, when
ρ2/2 = ϕ†ϕ (cid:54)= 0. Similarly to the Abelian and the SU (2) cases, Gµ, are ill-deﬁned when
ρ = 0 and this can generally happen during preheating. Once again the right prescription is
to work in well-deﬁned variables in a non-singular gauge. In the Coulomb gauge, BL = 0 and
AaL = 0, the longitudinal modes G1L, G2L and ZL can be expressed in terms of the well-
deﬁned perturbations of ϕ: δϕ1, δϕ2 and δϕ3 respectively. In this gauge, the transverse modes
are even easier to handle: G1T± and G2T± reduce to A1T± and A2T±, respectively; similarly
ZT± → − sin θW BT± + cos θW A1T± and AT± → cos θW BT± + sin θW A1T±. Hence we can keep the
expressions for the transverse modes since they have no singularities in them with ρ → ¯ϕ0. As
usual, using the SU (2) global invariance, we have rotated our internal axes along the direction
of motion of the inﬂaton.

Higgs condensate for the case when V (|ϕ|) = λ(cid:0)ϕ†ϕ(cid:1)2

For purposes of comparison with the literature, we provide the Floquet charts for the longi-
tudinal and transverse modes of the W and Z ﬁelds which are excited by the oscillations of the
= λρ4/4, see Fig. 5. The longitudinal
modes are excited parametrically during reheating. The inﬂaton decay to transverse modes of
the gauge ﬁelds mimics the well studied ϕ2χ2 scalar ﬁeld model [88].

Without the longitudinal modes, the back-reaction of the transverse gauge ﬁelds would be
identical to the one in ϕ2χ2. However, recent numerical experiments [67] indicate that there
are small diﬀerences between the behaviour of the inﬂaton decaying to scalars and to Abelian
gauge ﬁelds. This might be due to the longitudinal modes being excited and playing a role
in the back-reaction process. In general, calculations during (p)reheating and estimation of the
eﬀects of non-Abelian interaction terms are convenient in the Coulomb gauge (or some other well-
deﬁned gauge during preheating). The traditional unitary gauge is not a good choice because the
inﬂaton oscillates through the origin. Although as we saw in the Abelian case, the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds can be well deﬁned even when using gauge invariant variables, the intermediate
steps leading up their calculation often involve singular behavior which at the very least leads to
numerical unpleasantness. The same comment holds for the Unitary gauge since the equations
of motion are identical to those in gauge invariant variables.

inﬂation.

7 Observational consequences

Particle production during and after inﬂation in models with a charged inﬂaton coupled to gauge
ﬁelds may leave potentially observable signatures such as primordial magnetic ﬁelds, charge
ﬂuctuations as well as scalar and tensor metric perturbations. We schematically discuss each one
in turn.

7.1 Magnetic ﬁelds

At the end of inﬂation the magnetic ﬁeld power spectrum on superhorizon scales is blue and
given by a power-law, see eqns. (3.19) and (3.20). If the gauge ﬁelds are ‘lighter’ than the co-
(cid:46) H we have ∆BT± ∝ k2. If the gauge ﬁelds are
moving Hubble scale during inﬂation, i.e. for kC
(cid:38) H, the power spectrum is much steeper: ∆BT± ∝ k5/2. After inﬂation,
“massive” enough, kC
the oscillating inﬂaton can resonantly amplify the gauge ﬁelds. For the m2|ϕ|2 model considered
in Section 3.2, the resonance is broad and eﬀective for kC /a ∼ gA| ¯ϕ| (cid:38) m, where ¯ϕ is the vev of
the inﬂaton during the early stages of preheating at the end of inﬂation.14

The above considerations show that the optimal range for production of magnetic ﬁelds on
(cid:46) H during inﬂation and kC /a (cid:38) m during preheating. However,
superhorizon scales is kC
for m2|ϕ|2 inﬂation, kC /(am) (cid:38) 1 during preheating implies kC /H (cid:38) 1 during inﬂation, thus
excluding the possibility of broad resonance and a relatively shallow power law for the magnetic

14In the more popular notation, the parameter determining the strength of the resonance, q, is given by q =

kC /(am). The resonance is broad when q (cid:29) 1 and narrow or absent when q (cid:46) 1.

ﬁeld spectrum. We reached the same conclusion via a more detailed calculation whose results
were summarized in Fig. 2. We have to settle for two separate regimes: ∆BT± ∝ k2 which
receives no resonant ampliﬁcation during preheating, or ∆BT± ∝ k5/2 which can be resonantly
ampliﬁed until it backreacts.
In the contemporary universe, observations indicate a magnetic ﬁeld strength of ∼ 10−7 G
on 1 Mpc scales (for example, see [59]). If a seed magnetic ﬁeld Bseed (cid:38) 10−25 G is present on
comoving scales corresponding to 1 Mpc at the time of matter-radiation equality, the galactic
dynamo mechanism can potentially amplify Bseed to the observed values today [59]. As we show
below, the seed ﬁeld generated in the models under consideration are far too small compared to
what is required observationally.

adec ∼ 10−3, k = few Mpc
(cid:38) H, the magnetic
ﬁeld can be resonantly ampliﬁed, with an ampliﬁcation factor that can be as large as ∼ 104− 105.
The maximum value is set by back-reaction considerations. However, there is a suppression factor
suppressed compared to the no-resonance scenario. For the case when kC = 103 H at the end of
inﬂation (shown in Fig. 2), Bseed ∼ 10−58 G. For this estimate we assumed that the back-reaction
takes place 2.5 e-folds after inﬂation, and subsequently the magnetic ﬁeld redshifts in the usual
way: a4∆2
(cid:46) H for the m2|ϕ|2 models,
it can occur for kC < H for steeper potentials (e.g. λ|ϕ|4). It might be possible to boost the
amplitude of the seed ﬁeld up to 10−45 G in such cases. However, this is still too small to be
observationally relevant. Successful magnetogenesis from reheating has been recently discussed
in models diﬀerent from ours (see for example, [79, 80])

BT± = const for another 57.5 e-folds.

We note that while broad resonance does not happen for kC

7.2 Charge ﬂuctuations

(cid:46) H and kC

Just like the magnetic ﬁeld, the charge ﬂuctuations also have a blue power spectrum at the
end of inﬂation. Recalling Gauss law, −kEL
k = a2j0k, we arrive at the useful expression ∆j0 =
(k/a)∆EL. Indeed eqns. (3.19) and (3.20) imply that on superhorizon scales ∆j0 ∝ k2 and k5/2
(cid:38) H respectively, reminiscent of the magnetic ﬁeld spectrum. After inﬂation,
for kC
parametric resonance can amplify the charge ﬂuctuations in the m2|ϕ|2 model, provided we are
in the broad resonance regime gA| ¯ϕ| (cid:38) m (i.e. kC
(cid:38) H with a spectrum ∝ k5/2 on superhorizon
scales). Note that unlike the magnetic ﬁeld case, we see some production of charge ﬂuctuations
on superhorizon scales at the end of inﬂation even when m (cid:38) gA| ¯ϕ|. This ﬂuctuation production
is related to the oscillation of the inﬂaton, but cannot be analysed with simple Floquet analysis
since it occurs on superhorizon scales where expansion plays a signiﬁcant role.

If we imagine that the gauge ﬁeld in question is the electromagnetic ﬁeld and put gA = 2e
one can compare the charge ﬂuctuations to the observational bounds from vorticity and cos-
mological magnetic ﬁelds on the electrical charge asymmetry of the universe [89], namely that
∆j0/(enB ) (cid:46) 10−26 on co-moving scales corresponding to 102 kpc today, where nB ∼ 1.5×10−10 T 3
is the number of baryons and T is the photon temperature. For kC < H, we can assume the

34

universe reheats immediately after the end of inﬂation and the charge ﬂuctuation is trans-
ferred to a charge asymmetry in the ordinary matter.15 The charge asymmetry will then
redshift as a3∆j0 = const, akin to number density. Then the fractional charge asymmetry
∆j0/enB ∼ 109 × (k/arhTrh)2 (gA|ϕinf|/Trh) ∼ 10−36 , where we used |ϕinf| ∼ mPl, k = 10 Mpc
−1,
Tend ∼ 1016 GeV and aendTend ∼ T0 = 2.5 × 10−4eV.16 For the broad resonance regime, kC
(cid:38) H,
the amplitude of the charge ﬂuctuations can be parametrically ampliﬁed up to 103 − 104. How-
ever, there is also a suppression factor which dominates on the scales of interest. Explicitly,
for kC = 103 H discussed in Fig. 2, if we assume that the universe reheats immediately after
back-reaction has taken place (2.5 e-folds after the end of inﬂation) and then the universe ex-
∆j0/(enB ) ≈ 10−45.

pands for another 57.5 e-folds, the suppression factor is roughly ∼ (cid:112)exp(−2.5)k/kC , implying

Again, we recall that in the m2|ϕ|2 model, broad resonance does not happen for kC

(cid:46) H.
For steeper power-law potentials, parametric resonance is eﬃcient for light gauge ﬁelds and the
excess of charged particles per baryon can go up to 10−32. We once again caution the reader that
the calculations here are meant to be schematic.

7.3 Metric perturbations

The production of gauge ﬁelds may aﬀect the primordial metric perturbations, giving rise to (for
example) non-gaussianities and gravitational waves. Since the gravitational production of gauge
ﬁelds during inﬂation is not signiﬁcant, they are not expected to give rise to any interesting
signals. However, if the post-inﬂationary dynamics include parametric ampliﬁcation of ﬁelds
then interesting signatures are possible. For example, light scalar ﬁelds might develop a non-zero
vev across the observable universe today along with perturbations around this vev within each
Hubble patch at the time of preheating. The details of the following non-linear stage might
depend on the vev in each separate universe. For instance, in [90–92] it was shown that as the
inﬂaton decays to a light χ ﬁeld in φ2χ2 models, the back-reaction depends on the initial vev ¯χi
within the Hubble patch. This in turn aﬀects the expansion history within the Hubble patch and
therefore may lead to non-gaussianities. ¯χi also aﬀects the gravitational waves produced during
the non-linear evolution within the separate patches. This may lead to low-multiple corrections
to the stochastic gravitational wave background [93, 94].

(cid:46) H one can show that the gauge ﬁeld sector has a light scalar with a scale invariant
power spectrum - it is δϕ1 in the Coulomb gauge, see eq. (2.46) and Appendix A. This implies
that δϕ1 develops a non-zero vev across the sky with deviations from it within each Hubble patch
at the time of preheating. Its back-reaction should lead to similar eﬀects to the ϕ2χ2 models,
since the resonance structure is similar. Note that for the m2|ϕ|2 model we have been considering,
(cid:46) H (which was necessary for
backreaction cannot happen because resonance is ineﬃcient if kC
(cid:46) H is a feature of
developing a vev for δϕ1 during inﬂation). The absence of resonance for kC
m2|ϕ|2 model. For steeper potentials (e.g λ|ϕ|4), broad resonance can occur for kC

For kC

(cid:46) H.

15Note that at the end of inﬂation this charge would correspond to longitudinal electric ﬁelds of enormous
strength. This may lead to Schwinger pair production, which can annihilate the charge on this scales. For kC = H,
e∆EL ∼ 10−2 GeV (cid:29) melectron. However, this estimate is not reliable, since the vev of the Standard Model Higgs
is largely uncertain at the end of inﬂation. It is not clear what the masses of the fermions are.

16We caution the reader that this is a very rough estimate.

8 Conclusions

In this paper, we carried out a self-contained analysis of particle production during and after
inﬂation in models with charged scalars coupled to Abelian and non-Abelian ﬁelds. We calculated
the power spectra of the produced gauge ﬁelds in the regime where the equations of motion
could be linearized. We also provided a prescription for setting up initial conditions for lattice
simulations to further evolve the ﬁelds nonlinearly.

To make our treatment self-contained, we provided the necessary equations for linear per-
turbations (including metric ﬂuctuations) in terms of gauge invariant variables, and provided
a dictionary to relate these variables to those in some common gauges. This should allow re-
sults to be translated between gauges quite easily. For pedagogical purposes, we carried out the
initial analysis for the Abelian model. In the later half of the paper we provided the explicit
generalization to the non-Abelian cases.

We carried out the quantization and evolution of the perturbations during inﬂation in terms
of gauge invariant variables. After substituting the constraint equations into the original action,
the quantization and subsequent evolution was carried out in a straightforward manner. Gauge
invariant variables have the advantage of automatically dealing with the correct number of degrees
of freedom; we never having to worry about spurious gauge modes. We numerically calculated
the electric and magnetic ﬁeld power spectra at the end of inﬂation for a simple m2|ϕ|2 inﬂation
(see Fig. 1). We provided an understanding of the shape of the spectra (blue tilt and broken
power law behavior – see eqns. (3.19) and (3.20)) in terms of two scales: the co-moving Compton
wavenumber of the gauge ﬁelds kC ≡ a| ¯ϕ|gA/2 ( ¯ϕ is the vev of the inﬂaton condensate during
inﬂation, gA is the coupling strength and a is the scalefactor) and the conformal Hubble scale
H. We found that the transverse modes are always dominant over the longitudinal ones on
(cid:38) H the longitudinal modes are as
sub-Compton scales, k (cid:38) kC . For gauge ﬁelds with kC
(cid:46) H the
energetic as the transverse ones on super-Compton scales, k (cid:46) kC , whereas when kC
longitudinal modes dominate on super-Compton scales. The longitudinal mode of the electric ﬁeld
is directly proportional to charge ﬂuctuations, and hence charge ﬂuctuations are also generated
during inﬂation. While our numerical calculations assumed a particular model, these results are
expected to hold more generally for potentials where the inﬂaton is rolling slowly. As a further
check, we carried out a semi-analytic analysis in de Sitter universe and conﬁrmed shapes of the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld spectra.

While gauge invariant variables are suited for calculations during inﬂation, they become ill-
deﬁned when the inﬂaton starts oscillating after inﬂation. After inﬂation, the Coulomb gauge
turns out to be a particularly well-suited for preheating studies. We carried out an explicit
numerical calculation of resonant gauge ﬁeld production during preheating and provided power
spectra of the corresponding electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the end of preheating (see Fig. 2). For
an analytic understanding of the main features of the spectra, we carried out a Floquet analysis
of the instabilities with the gauge constraints included (see Fig. 3). In both calculations, we
found that the longitudinal modes are as prone to resonant excitation during preheating as the
transverse ones. The characteristic wavenumber range of the instability is k (cid:46) m(gAmPl/m)1/2,
whereas growth rate of ﬂuctuations is determined by gAmPl/m. We also estimated that the gauge
ﬁelds back react on the scalar condensate within about 10 oscillations in the case of a m2|ϕ|2

36

potential and for couplings, gA ∼> 10−3 (see Fig. 4). For gA
signiﬁcantly enough to back-react.

(cid:46) 10−4 gauge ﬁelds are not produced

If back-reaction becomes important, the occupation numbers in the gauge ﬁelds are usually
very high. Further evolution, which is usually highly nonlinear, can be investigated by numerical
lattice simulations within the classical approximation. We provided a scheme for initializing such
simulations with the gauge constraints being violated only at second order in the perturbations.
We also provide a work-around enabling the gauge constraints to be satisﬁed more precisely at
the expense of insigniﬁcant (second order in perturbations) modiﬁcation to the spectrum of the
gauge of ﬁelds. Our prescription for initial conditions is not restricted to a particular gauge;
we provide an explicit example of setting up such conditions in the temporal gauge which is
commonly used for simulations (see Section 5). The derived power spectra as well as the initial
conditions prescription might be useful for lattice simulations of Abelian and non-Abelian ﬁelds
at the end of inﬂation (for example, [46, 60–62, 64, 66–68, 81, 82]).

We considered two non-Abelian models. In the SU (2) model we showed that to linear order
in perturbations, the problem conveniently reduces to three decoupled identical replicas of the
Abelian model. We then extended the local group to SU (2)×U (1), with the Electroweak sector of
the Standard Model of Particle Physics in mind. Again, to linear order in the perturbations, the
problem splits into three copies of the Abelian model. There are two identical copies, describing
the evolution of the massive W bosons, and a similar one for the massive Z boson, the only
diﬀerence being the coupling constants. The massless photon A remains decoupled from the
other sectors of the theory. The framework describing the longitudinal and transverse modes
in the Abelian model can be straightforwardly applied to the W and Z sectors, including the
scheme for initialising lattice simulations. We provided Floquet charts to capture the instability
of these ﬁelds during preheating, assuming the scalar condensate to be characterised by λ(ϕ†ϕ)2
self-interaction (see Fig. 5). In this case, we again conﬁrm that the longitudinal and transverse
mode can be excited at a comparable level.

Our analysis allowed us to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld and charge ﬂuctuations from inﬂation
and preheating in a self-consistent manner. We found that the charged inﬂaton produces magnetic
ﬁeld that cannot exceed ∼ 10−50 G on 1 Mpc scales today (consistent with [71]) for m2|ϕ|2
potential. Parametric resonance in models with steeper potentials, e.g. λ|ϕ|4 may boost the
magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of 105, which is still not enough to seed an eﬃcient galactic dynamo
mechanism. The charge ﬂuctuations are shown to be also below the observational bounds, if the
inﬂaton is assumed to be electrically charged. The excess charged particles per baryon are found
to be at most (cid:46) 10−36 on 0.1 Mpc scales for m2|ϕ|2 potential. Preheating in models with steeper
potentials, e.g. λ|ϕ|4 may amplify this by a factor of 104. This is well within the observational
bound of (cid:46) 10−26 [89]. The possibility of an electrically charged inﬂaton is not ruled out.

Our analysis also reveals that the asymuthal degree of freedom of the charged inﬂaton develops
a scale-invariant power spectrum if the gauge ﬁelds are lighter than the Hubble scale. This gives
us the possibility of generating non-Gaussianities and gravitational waves [46, 90–94] from the
non-linear stage of reheating which we leave for future work.

A Gauge ﬁeld perturbations in de Sitter space

Let us try to understand the electric and magnetic ﬁeld power spectra at the end of inﬂation
using some simpliﬁed semi-analytic analysis. For this purpose, we approximate the space-time
to be de Sitter, H = const, and the inﬂaton to roll slow enough (so that d ln ρ/d ln a (cid:28) 1), or
more precisely, ρ → const. The equations governing the evolution of the mode functions are then
given by

(cid:1) uT±

where kC = agA ¯ρ/2 = −gA ¯ρ/2Hτ . Note that kC depends on τ and that τ is negative during
inﬂation.17

The analytic solutions for the transverse modes of constant mass in de Sitter space-time are

known, e.g. cf. [72]. Using the WKB initial conditions, (3.13), we have

distinction between the kC (cid:28) H and kC (cid:29) H regimes discussed in Section 3.2 becomes a bit more
evident. For kC /H > 1/2, z is purely imaginary. For kC /H < 1/2, z is purely real, and cannot
exceed (1/2). The asymptotes of the Hankel functions depend on z and its complex phase.
We shall now explain the double power-laws observed in the magnetic and transverse electric
ﬁelds. We will ﬁrst focus on the kC /H > 1

We note two things. Firstly, the break in the double power-laws occurs where it did in the plots
based on the numerical calculation for V (ρ) = m2ρ2/2 evaluated at the end of inﬂation provided
17The equations look a lot simpler, and are easier to analyze by doing the following change of variables: x = −kτ
and α = kC /H. Doing this makes x = −kτ the only independent variable, with α acting as a time and scale
independent parameter. We do not use x and α in the presentation to avoid introducing too many new variables.

43

in Fig. 1 (cf. eq. (3.19)). Secondly, the diﬀerence in the kC dependence implies that at late
times (k (cid:28) kC ) there will be more power stored in the form of transverse electric ﬁeld and less in
the form of magnetic ﬁeld. The product of the transverse electric and magnetic power spectra,
however, is unchanged.
We repeat the same procedure for the magnetic and transverse electric ﬁelds in the weak
coupling regime, kC /H < 1
k and
∂τ uT±
k. That is why in this coupling regime the
magnetic power spectrum is described by a single power-law. The late time behaviour of the
∂τ uT±
∂τ uT±
k, implying a double power-law for the transverse electric ﬁeld, at a scale deﬁned
by the square of kC . The actual power spectra again agree with what we found in Section 3.2 for
the m2ρ2/2 inﬂation (cf. eq. (3.20))

Although, the k-scaling of ∆2
EL in the weak coupling regime (cf. eq. (3.20)) is accounted for by
our calculations in de Sitter space-time, the power excess on super-Hubble scales seen in Fig. 1
is not. This requires a more general consideration in which the time dependences of H and ρ are
included.

B The Abelian model in Coulomb gauge

In Coulomb gauge ∂iAi = 0, the background variables we consider are ( ¯ϕ0, ¯ϕ1) = ( ¯ϕ0(τ ), 0) (using
k , A0k , AT±
the U (1) gauge symmetry). The linearised perturbations in Fourier space are δ ˜ϕ0
.
Note that we have not chosen a particular space-time slicing, i.e. we are working in diﬀeomor-
phism invariant variables. E.g. δ ˜ϕ0 is given by δ ˜ρ from eq. (2.12), with ¯ρ → ¯ϕ0. The correspond-
ing equations of motion are as follows.
