CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

Abstract. We develop a technique of multiple scale asymptotic expansions along mean
ﬂows and a corresponding notion of weak multiple scale convergence. These are applied
to homogenize convection dominated parabolic equations with rapidly oscillating, locally
periodic coeﬃcients and O(ε−1) mean convection term. Crucial to our analysis is the intro-
duction of a fast time variable, τ = t/ε, not apparent in the heterogeneous problem. The
eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient is expressed in terms of the average of Eulerian cell solutions
along the orbits of the mean ﬂow in the fast time variable. To make this notion rigorous,
we use the theory of ergodic algebras with mean value.

This article studies the homogenization of parabolic equations of convection-diﬀusion type
with locally periodic (in space), rapidly oscillating coeﬃcients. This work addresses the self-
similar diﬀusive scaling in these equations, i.e. for an unknown scalar density uε(t, x), we
consider the Cauchy problem for a convection-diﬀusion equation with large convection term:

with 0 < ε ≪ 1 the scale of heterogeneity. This scaling corresponds to the long-term
behaviour which can be described in terms of the eﬀective or homogenized limit of the
above scaled system.

It has remained a largely open problem to determine the homogenized limit of the scaled
equation (1). This present work gives a partial answer to this question in the sense that
we homogenize the non-homogeneous equation with locally periodic coeﬃcients under some

structural assumptions on the ﬂows associated with certain vector ﬁelds. This is achieved
by the introduction of a new notion of weak convergence in Lp spaces with 1 < p < ∞.

Under no diﬀuse scaling, i.e. with no large convection term, homogenization of such
equations is classical. In such a scenario, we can either employ the method of asymptotic
expansions (see for instance, the monographs [8, 36]) which provides us with the approxi-
mation

or employ a weak convergence approach of the two-scale convergence method introduced by
G. Nguetseng in [29] and further developed by G. Allaire in [1]. The cornerstone result of
the two-scale convergence method is that, up to extraction of a subsequence, any uniformly
(w.r.t ε) bounded sequence {uε} in some Lp space with 1 < p < ∞ satisﬁes

for some u0(t, x, y) ∈ Lp((0, T )×Rd ×Td) called the weak two-scale limit and for any smooth
ψ(t, x, y) which is periodic in the y variable.

Any weak convergence approach to homogenize a partial diﬀerential equation would in-
volve passing to the limit (as the heterogeneity length scale tends to zero) in the weak
formulation associated to the partial diﬀerential equation. This would require passing to
the limit in products of weakly converging sequences. The main feature of the two-scale con-
vergence method is that the particular choice of test functions allows us to pass to the limit
in such products. If uε(t, x) weakly two-scale converges to u0(t, x, y) ∈ Lp((0, T ) × Rd × Td)
and if the coeﬃcient function a(t, x, y), which is periodic in the y variable, is admissible
(roughly speaking, continuous or approximable by continuous functions in a certain sense -
see Deﬁnition 7 for precise statement), then the product has the convergence

as ε → 0,

in the sense of distributions.

In recent years, there have been numerous publications in the mathematics literature
dedicated to generalize the notion of two-scale convergence (originally developed to handle
periodic structures) to address the homogenization of partial diﬀerential equations with
coeﬃcients that belong to some ergodic algebras. Typically, all these works are about the
study of the limiting behaviour (as ε → 0) of the integral

when {vε} is a uniformly bounded sequence in some Lebesgue space Lp with 1 < p < ∞
and ψ(x, y) belongs to certain ergodic algebra in the y variable. The notion of algebras with
mean value play a crucial role in these theories. This notion goes back to the work of Zhikov

and Krivenko [38] in the early 1980’s (also see the book of Jikov, Kozlov and Oleinik [25]
for a pedagogical exposition). We cite some of the references in this context which we have
consulted in developing our theory: [13, 30, 31, 33].

With regard to the homogenization of the scaled equation (1), the known results are

when the rapidly oscillating coeﬃcients are purely periodic, i.e. of the type b(cid:0) x

The case when the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(·) is of zero mean was treated in [8, 28] using two-scale
asymptotic expansions of the form (2). They do not prove convergence. Over two decades
ago, to address the case of ﬂuid ﬁeld b(·) of non-zero mean, G. Papanicolaou suggested in
[34] a modiﬁed two-scale asymptotic expansion where the coeﬃcients in the expansion are
taken along rapidly moving coordinates:

ε(cid:1), D(cid:0) x
ε(cid:1).

The constant b∗ ∈ Rd is the mean ﬁeld associated with b(·). Note that the case b∗ = 0
coincides with the classical expansion (2). We cite the works in [6, 3, 4] where the above
expansion with drift is employed in homogenizing reactive transport models in periodic
porous media.

Analogous to the two-scale convergence method, Marušić-Paloka and Piatnitski intro-
duced a notion of weak convergence in [27] called the two-scale convergence with drift (see
[2] for a pedagogical exposition of this method) characterizing the limit

ε→0 ZZ

where ψ(t, x, y) is periodic in the y variable and as usual the family {uε} is uniformly
bounded (w.r.t ε) in some Lp space with 1 < p < ∞.

Neither the modiﬁed two-scale expansion (3) nor the notion of two-scale convergence
with drift seem capable of treating equation (1) with locally periodic, rapidly oscillating
coeﬃcients, i.e. when b depends upon both x and y. We cite the work of P-E. Jabin and A.
Tzavaras [24] which treats the homogenization of (1) with locally periodic ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y)
and diﬀusion coeﬃcient being unity. They treat a special case when the mean ﬁeld ¯b(x) of
the locally periodic ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) vanishes, i.e. ¯b(x) ≡ 0 for all x. They introduce a
notion of kinetic decomposition to address this problem. As far as the authors are aware,
the techniques of [24] are not capable of addressing the case of non-zero mean ﬁeld.

In this work, we introduce a new multiple scale expansion

uε(t, x) ≈ u0(cid:0)t, Φ−t/ε(x)(cid:1) + εu1(cid:18)t,

which we call multiple scale expansion along mean ﬂows. The coeﬃcient functions ui in
(4) are taken on rapidly moving coordinates Φ−t/ε(x) which is the ﬂow associated with the
mean ﬁeld ¯b(x) of the locally periodic ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y). A novelty of our method is the
introduction of the fast time variable τ := t/ε. The main assumption in this work is on the

4

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

Jacobian matrix J(τ, x) associated with the ﬂow Φτ (x).
Assumption: There is a uniform constant C such that |J(τ, x)| ≤ C for all (τ, x) ∈ R × Rd.

The above assumption is trivially satisﬁed in all the previously known works on the
homogenization of (1) because the Jacobian matrix associated with the ﬂows in all these
works is the identity.

Under this assumption, we derive a homogenized diﬀusion equation for the zeroth order
approximation u0 in (4) with an explicit expression for the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
The diﬀusion equation for u0 is in Lagrangian coordinates because of the structure of the
asymptotic expansion. The eﬀect of Lagrangian stretching on the gradient of the scalar
density uε, i.e. creating large gradients has been widely studied in the literature in the case
of non-oscillating coeﬃcients (see for e.g.
[22, 9, 14, 21]). If the above assumption is not
made on the Jacobian matrix, we cannot expect a nontrivial limit as the large gradients can
drive the solution to zero quickly.

Taking inspiration from the work of Marušić-Paloka and Piatnitski [27], we devise a weak

convergence approach which involves the characterization of the limit

with a uniformly bounded family {uε} in some Lp space (1 < p < +∞) and the test function
ψ(t, τ, x, y) being periodic in the y variable and belongs to an ergodic algebra with mean value
in the τ variable. We call this notion of convergence weak Σ-convergence along ﬂows.

ε, x

To use this new notion of convergence, our strategy is to use test functions of the form

would have terms involving the Jacobian matrix associated with the Φ−t/ε(x). Note that

ψ(cid:0)t, Φ−t/ε(x), t
the Jacobian matrix depends on the fast time variable, i.e. appears as J(cid:0) t

ε(cid:1) in the weak formulation of the scaled problem (1). This weak formulation
ε, x(cid:1), because of

the chosen time scale in the ﬂow. Our strategy, hence, is to consider test functions that
belong to some ergodic algebra in the fast time variable τ .

Inspired by the notion of admissible functions introduced by G. Allaire in [1] and further
clariﬁed by M. Radu in her PhD thesis [35], we introduce a notion of admissible functions
adapted to the weak Σ-convergence along ﬂows (see Deﬁnition 8). Another novelty of our
approach is to consider the ﬂow-representation of functions (see Subsection 2.2 for precise
deﬁnition). Our main result is to show that if the ﬂow-representations of the ﬂuid ﬁeld
b(x, y), the diﬀusion matrix D(x, y), the Jacobian matrix J(τ, x) are admissible, then we
can derive the eﬀective limit diﬀusion equation. These assumptions on the coeﬃcients and
the Jacobian matrix are very essential for our analysis as is evident from the counterexamples
that are constructed in Section 5 of this paper.

The main homogenization result of this article is Theorem 11. We summarize this result

below (consult Theorem 11 in Section 4 for precise statement).
Theorem. Let Φτ (x) be the ﬂow associated with the mean ﬁeld ¯b(x). Suppose the associated
Jacobian matrix J(τ, x) is a uniformly bounded function of τ and x variables. Let the ﬂow-
representations of the coeﬃcients in (1) and that of the Jacobian matrix belong to certain

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

ergodic algebra with mean value. Then the solution family uε(t, x) weakly Σ-converges along
the ﬂow Φτ to the unique solution of the homogenized equation

∂u0
∂t

− ∇X ·(cid:16)D(X)∇Xu0(cid:17) = 0

where the eﬀective diﬀusion matrix D(X) is given in terms of certain averages of solutions
to cell problems and the averages are taken along the orbits of the mean ﬂow.

Outline of the paper:

• In Section 2, we introduce the method of multiple scale asymptotic expansions along
mean ﬂows to derive the eﬀective equation for the scaled equation (8a)-(8b). This
result is recorded as Proposition 1 which gives an explicit expression for the eﬀective
diﬀusion matrix.

• Section 3 introduces the new notion of weak convergence. In Subsections 3.1 through
3.5, we recall enough of the theory of algebras with mean value. The notion of Σ-
convergence along ﬂows is introduced in Subsection 3.6. The main compactness
result with regard to this new notion of convergence is given by Theorem 5.
In
Subsection 3.8, we obtain compactness results on the gradient sequences (in the
sense of corrector results in homogenization).

• Section 4 deals with the homogenization result. The main result of this section
is Theorem 11. The main assumptions made on the coeﬃcients and the Jacobian
matrix are explained in Subsection 4.2.

• Section 5 provides some discussion on the assumptions made on the coeﬃcients
and the Jacobian matrix. In particular, we give some examples of ﬂuid ﬁelds with
bounded Jacobians and show that unbounded growth in the Jacobian matrix can
lead to trivial and singular behaviour of the limit u0. We also provide an explicit
example of an equation, where the assumptions on the ﬂow-representation of the
coeﬃcients do not hold, leading to two diﬀerent homogenized equations in the ε → 0
limit.

• In Section 6, we perform asymptotic analysis on some explicit convection-diﬀusion
models which highlights the eﬀectiveness of this new approach in addressing the
large convection terms. Finally, in Section 7, we give some concluding remarks.

2. Asymptotic expansion along flows

2.1. Mathematical model. Let b(x, y) : Rd × Td → Rd be a prescribed time-independent
ﬂuid ﬁeld which is incompressible in both the x and y variables, i.e.

(5)

∇x · b(x, y) = ∇y · b(x, y) = 0

for a.e. (x, y) ∈ Rd × Td.

Deﬁne the associated mean ﬁeld as

(6)

¯b(x) :=ZTd

b(x, y) dy.

Notation: For any matrix B, its transpose is denoted by ⊤B.

Let D(x, y) ∈ L∞(Rd × Td; Rd×d) be a given time-independent symmetric (i.e. D = ⊤D)

matrix-valued diﬀusion coeﬃcient which is assumed to be uniformly coercive, i.e.

(7)

∃ λ, Λ > 0 s.t. λ|ξ|2 ≤ ⊤ξ D(x, y) ξ ≤ Λ|ξ|2 ∀ξ ∈ Rd and for a.e. (x, y) ∈ Rd × Td.

Let 0 < ε ≪ 1 be the scale of heterogeneity. Let us consider a scaled Cauchy problem with
rapidly oscillating coeﬃcients for an unknown scalar density uε(t, x) : [0, T [×Rd → [0, ∞).

The two-scale expansions with drift method (see [27, 15, 6, 2, 3, 4]) employs the asymptotic

where the drift velocity b∗ ∈ Rd is a constant and the coeﬃcient functions ui(t, x, y) are
assumed to be periodic in the y variable. Remark that the coeﬃcient functions ui in (9) are
written in moving coordinates. To be precise, consider the ordinary diﬀerential equation

(10)

˙X = b∗;

X(0) = x.

Denote by Φτ (x) the ﬂow associated with (10). The ﬂow evaluated at the time instant
(−t/ε) is nothing but the moving coordinates taken in the asymptotic expansion (9), i.e.

Φ−t/ε(x) = x −

b∗t

.

The idea of considering the asymptotic expansion along moving coordinates was mentioned
by G. Papanicolaou in a survey paper [34]. It should be noted that the two-scale expansions
with drift method can handle the homogenization of convection-diﬀusion equation (8a) only
when the ﬂuid ﬁeld is purely periodic, i.e. b(x, y) ≡ b(y). In that case, the constant drift
velocity is taken to be

b∗ =ZTd

b(y) dy.

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

Taking cues from the constant drift scenario, consider the autonomous system

(11)

˙X = ¯b(X);

X(0) = x.

Again, denoting the ﬂow associated with (11) by Φτ (x), we postulate the asymptotic ex-
pansion in the spirit of (9):

uε(t, x) =

εiui(cid:18)t,

Note that the coeﬃcient functions ui(t, τ, X, y) in (12) depend on an additional variable
τ which we shall call the fast time variable. We assume that the coeﬃcient functions
ui(t, τ, X, y) are periodic in the y variable. The structural assumption on the coeﬃcients
ui(t, τ, X, y) with regard to the τ variable is a little bit subtle. We shall assume that the
coeﬃcient functions, as a function of τ , belong to an ergodic algebra with mean value. This
shall guarantee the existence of certain weak* limits. This shall be made more rigorous
in a later stage of the article (see Section 3). The authors of [12] also introduced a fast
time variable in their asymptotic expansion. However, they do not consider the expansion
along moving coordinates as is the case in (12). Also, the authors of [12] assume that the
coeﬃcient functions decay exponentially in the fast time variable.

2.2. Flow representation. We introduce a notion of ﬂow representation that is very cen-
tral to our analysis. The choice of considering rapidly moving coordinates in the expansion
(12) is equivalent to expressing the convection-diﬀusion equation (8a) in Lagrangian coor-
dinates. This necessitates the consideration of the coeﬃcient functions in the convection-
diﬀusion equation in Lagrangian coordinates. Essentially, the ﬂow representation takes into
account the underlying ﬂow structure associated with the mean ﬁeld ¯b(x).

To be precise, consider a function f : Rd → R and a ﬂow Φτ (x) : R × Rd → Rd. The ﬂow

representation of f is given by the function ef : R × Rd → R deﬁned as

We shall use the following convention for their ﬂow representations when we encounter
locally periodic functions, i.e. functions of the form f (x, y) : Rd × Td → R

ef (τ, x) := f (Φτ (x)).
ef (τ, x, y) := f (Φτ (x), y).

The following observations are obvious for the ﬂow representations:

ef (0, x) = f (x);
ef (τ, Φτ ′(x)) = f (Φτ +τ ′(x))
ef (τ, X) = f (x)

for any τ, τ ′ ∈ R;

with the convention X := Φ−τ (x).

When we encounter vector-valued functions, it should be noted that their ﬂow representa-
tions are taken component-wise. It should also be noted that the ﬂow Φτ used in giving
the ﬂow representation of a function can be any one-parameter group of transformation and
need not be associated with any vector ﬁeld.

Remark 1. The one parameter group U τ deﬁned by (U τ f )(x) := ef (τ, x) is generated (at

least formally, i.e. without regard to functional spaces) by the skew-symmetric operator
¯b(x) · ∇.

2.3. Flows associated with vector ﬁelds. Let J(τ, x) denote the Jacobian matrix of the
ﬂow Φτ generated by (11), i.e.

We have used the convention that J(τ, x) is the Jacobian of the backwards ﬂow Φ−τ (x) to
ease notation as it is this that appears throughout. The ﬂow representation of the Jacobian
matrix function J : R × Rd → Rd×d is deﬁned by

In order to ensure the validity of the proposed asymptotic expansion (12) we make the
assumption of uniform boundedness on the Jacobian matrix:

eJ(τ, Φ−τ (x)) = eJ(τ, X) = J(τ, x).

Assumption 1. There is a constant C such that |J(τ, x)| ≤ C for all τ ∈ R and x ∈ Rd.

To ﬁnish this subsection we record some facts regarding the change of variables. Although
these are well known, we provide a proof in Appendix (Section 8) for the convenience of the
reader.

earlier. In the case of constant drift (9), we have the following chain rules for diﬀerentiating

The strategy of any asymptotic expansion method in homogenization is to substitute the
postulated expansion into the model equation and solve a cascade of equations for obtaining
the coeﬃcient functions in the asymptotic expansion. All the equations in this cascade
obtained by this approach have a similar structure. Next, we state a standard Fredholm
type result which guarantees the solvability of such equations provided the source terms
satisfy a compatibility condition.

Lemma 2. Let x ∈ Rd be a ﬁxed parameter. Suppose g(x, ·) ∈ L2(Td) be the source term in
the boundary value problem:

b(x, y) · ∇yf − ∇y · (D(x, y)∇yf ) = g(x, y)

in Td.

Then there exists a unique solution f ∈ H 1(Td)/R := {f ∈ H 1(Td) :RTd f dy = 0} to (15)

Next, we record a formal result on the homogenized equation for the scaled equation with

rapidly oscillating coeﬃcients (8a)-(8b).

in Td,

Remark 2. Even though we postulate an inﬁnite sum in the asymptotic expansion (12),
we compute only the zeroth and ﬁrst order coeﬃcients as in (17). Our goal is to obtain an
evolution equation for the zeroth order approximation, i.e. the homogenized equation (19a).
For this purpose, the ﬁrst order approximation (17) suﬃces. Continuing the expansion
for higher order coeﬃcients in the asymptotic expansion (12) in the spirit of the theory of
matching asymptotic is out of the scope of this present article. We shall address these issues
in future publications.

Remark 3. The dispersion eﬀects are evident from the expression (20) of the eﬀective
diﬀusion in the homogenized equation, i.e. the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcients depend on the
convective velocity. This is because of the strong convection in the scaled convection-diﬀusion
equation (8a).

Remark 4. Even though the molecular diﬀusion matrix D(x, y) is assumed to be symmetric,
the eﬀective diﬀusion matrix in the homogenized matrix is not symmetric as is evident from
the expression (21). The contribution of the non-symmetric part of the eﬀective diﬀusion
to the dynamics of the homogenized equation (19a) is because of the fact that the eﬀective
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is space dependent.

Remark 5. The expression (20) for the eﬀective diﬀusion involves the averaging in the
fast time variable. In this section dealing with formal derivation of the homogenized limit,
we admit that the limits in the expression of the eﬀective diﬀusion exist and are ﬁnite.
In Section 3, we introduce a notion of weak convergence in some Lebesgue function spaces
which proves that these limits indeed exist and are ﬁnite under certain assumptions on
the coeﬃcients. Note that some of these assumptions are required:
in Counterexample 2
in Section 5, we provide an explicit example where these limits do not exist, and in fact
multiple limit equations can be obtained on diﬀerent sequences ε → 0.

Remark 6. An interesting feature in the expression (20) is that the integrands are all in
their ﬂow representations. This suggests that the eﬀective diﬀusion is the cumulative eﬀect
of the convection and diﬀusion eﬀects averaged along the ﬂows.

Remark 7. The cell problem (22) in Proposition 1 is given in ﬁxed spatial coordinate, i.e.
ω ≡ ω(x, y). As our analysis essentially considers the asymptotic expansion in moving
for the ﬂow
coordinates along ﬂows, we can recast the cell problem (22) along ﬂows, i.e.

representation of the cell solutions eω(τ, X, y):
eb(τ, X, y) ·(cid:16)∇yeωi(τ, X, y) + ei(cid:17) − ∇y ·(cid:16)eD(τ, X, y) (∇yeωi(τ, X, y) + ei)(cid:17) =e¯b(τ, X) · ei.

(23)

The above problem is posed on Td. The spatial variable X and the fast time variable τ are
treated as parameters.

where the ﬂow representation of the Jacobian matrix and coeﬃcients are used. Note that
the relation (14) is needed, for example, to show the right hand side of the O(ε−2) equation
is zero. We remark that all the equations in (24) have the same structure as the boundary
value problem (15) addressed in Lemma 2 which says that the solvability of these equations
is subject to satisfying the compatibility condition (16).

The compatibility condition (16) is trivially satisﬁed for the equation of O(ε−2) in (24).

Further, the equation of O(ε−2) in (24) implies that u0 is independent of y, i.e.

u0(t, τ, X, y) ≡ u0(t, τ, X).

So the term involving ∇yu0 in the equation of O(ε−1) vanishes. To check if the right hand
side of the equation of O(ε−1) in (24) satisﬁes the compatibility condition (16), consider

ZTd

∇y ·(cid:16)eD(τ, X, y)⊤eJ ∇Xu0(cid:17) dy +ZTd (cid:16)e¯b(τ, X) −eb(τ, X, y)(cid:17) ·(cid:16)⊤eJ∇Xu0(cid:17) dy −ZTd

The ﬁrst integral in the previous expression vanishes by integration by parts. The second
integral in the previous expression vanishes as well, thanks to the deﬁnition (6) of the
mean ﬁeld ¯b(x), and as neither J nor u0 depend upon y. In the third integral, since u0
is independent of the y variable, in order to satisfy the compatibility condition, we should
have that u0 is independent of the fast time variable. Hence we have u0(t, τ, X, y) ≡ u0(t, X).
The linearity of equations in (24) implies that we can separate the variables in the ﬁrst

Finally, we write the compatibility condition for the equation of O(ε0) in (24):

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

for each i, j ∈ {1, · · · , d}. To simplify the expression for the matrix B, we test the equation

(23) for the ﬂow-representation eωi byeωj and deduce
ZTd (cid:16)e¯bi(τ, X) −ebi(τ, X, y)(cid:17)eωj(τ, X, y) dy =ZTd (cid:16)eb(τ, X, y) · ∇yeωi(τ, X, y)(cid:17)eωj(τ, X, y) dy

Using the above equation, we can rewrite the elements of the matrix B as in (21).

(cid:3)

Remark 8. The solution ωi to the cell problem (22) is unique upto addition of constants in
the y-variable, i.e. upto addition of a function η(t, τ, X). However, any such function would
not contribute to the expression of the eﬀective diﬀusion. It is evident from the equation (25).
So, for our purposes at hand, we shall not dwell on characterizing η(t, τ, X). It should be
noted that the ﬁrst order corrector obtained in (17) essentially is considering the oscillations
in the space variable. We have not characterized the ﬁrst order corrector with regard to the
fast time variable. This shall be the focus of future publications.

Proposition 2. The homogenized equation (19a)-(19b) admits a unique solution such that

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

This holds, thanks ﬁrstly to the positive deﬁnite property of the matrix B, and secondly to
uniform bounds from below on the Jacobian matrix, i.e.

C −1|ξ| = C −1|J(τ, x)−1J(τ, x)ξ| = C −1|J(−τ, Φ−τ (x))J(τ, x)ξ| ≤ |J(τ, x)ξ| ≤ C|ξ|

for the uniform constant C given by Assumption 1, and where we have used that the ﬂow
is autonomous to express the inverse of the Jacobian in terms of the Jacobian at a diﬀerent
point. Thus we have shown that the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(X) is positive deﬁnite.
On the other hand, D(X) is uniformly bounded from above. Then, it is a standard process
to prove existence and uniqueness for (19a)-(19b) (cf. [26] if necessary).

3. Σ-convergence along flows

This section puts forth a new notion of convergence in Lp-spaces (with 1 < p < ∞) which
gives a rigorous justiﬁcation of (at least) the ﬁrst two terms in the asymptotic expansion
along mean ﬂows (12) postulated in Section 2, i.e. to justify the approximation (17) in
Proposition 1. This work is inspired from the seminal works of G. Nguetseng [29] and G.
Allaire [1]. In Section 2, we have formally derived the homogenized limit and obtained an
explicit expression for the eﬀective diﬀusion (20). As mentioned in Remark 5, there was an
inherent assumption that the limits in the fast time variable exist and are ﬁnite.

The works [29, 1] are in the context of periodic homogenization. G. Allaire does mention
in [1] that it would be interesting to extend the two-scale convergence theory from the
periodic setting to the more general almost-periodic setting (see p.1484 in [1]). This has
been addressed in the past one and a half decade [13, 30, 31, 33, 37].
In all these new
developments, a central role is played by the notion of algebra with mean value introduced
by Zhikov and Krivenko in [38].

In this section we present the abstract framework of Σ-convergence along ﬂows. In sub-
sections 3.1-3.5 we develop enough of the theory of algebras with mean value for our later
purposes. As we do not aim to extend this theory beyond what already exists, we shall
not give the theory in full generality and we refer the reader to existing literature (e.g.
[13, 30, 31, 32, 37, 7], see also [20] for an introductory exposition and [25] for a pedagogi-
cal exposition) for a more complete presentation and full proofs. In subsections 3.6-3.8 we
introduce the new concept of Σ-convergence along ﬂows and prove compactness results.

3.1. Algebras with mean value. We shall denote the space of bounded uniformly con-
tinuous functions on R by BUC(R).

Deﬁnition 1 (Algebra with mean value). An algebra with mean value (or algebra w.m.v.,
in short) is a Banach sub-algebra A of BUC(R) such that the following hold:

(i) A contains the constants.
(ii) A is translation invariant, i.e. for every f ∈ A and a ∈ R, f (· − a) ∈ A.
(iii) Any f ∈ A possesses a mean value M(f ), by which we mean that

f(cid:16) ·
ε(cid:17) ⇀ M(f ) in L∞(R)-weak* as ε → 0.

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

17

Note that the mean value can be equivalently expressed as

M(f ) = lim
ℓ→∞

1
2ℓ

+ℓZ−ℓ

f (τ ) dτ

and that this limit exists for any f ∈ A.

The theory of algebra w.m.v.

is developed for the Banach space of bounded uniformly
continuous functions on Rd, i.e. in any arbitrary dimension. As this current work considers
a fast time variable (i.e. in one dimension), we recall all the essential notions in this theory
with emphasis on one dimension.

3.2. Gelfand representation theory.

Deﬁnition 2 (Spectrum of a Banach algebra). Given a commutative Banach algebra A
with an identity 1 ∈ A, we deﬁne its spectrum ∆(A) as the set of algebra homeomorphisms,
i.e. the maps s : A → C such that

(1) s is linear, i.e. for all f, g ∈ A, λ ∈ C, s(f + g) = s(f ) + s(g) and s(λf ) = λs(f ),
(2) s is multiplicative, i.e. for all f, g ∈ A, s(f g) = s(f )s(g),
(3) s preserves the identity, i.e. s(1) = 1.

The elements s ∈ ∆(A) are called the characters of A.

As ∆(A) ⊂ A′, the topological dual of A, we equip ∆(A) with the weak* subspace
topology induced by A′. This makes ∆(A) a compact Hausdorﬀ space by the Banach-
Alaoglu theorem.

Of central importance to the study of Banach algebras is the Gelfand transform. We

denote by C(∆(A)), the space of complex-valued continuous functions on ∆(A).

Deﬁnition 3 (Gelfand transform). The Gelfand transform is the map G : A → C(∆(A))
deﬁned by G(f )(s) = s(f ).

Notation: For brevity, we denote G(f ) as bf .

The importance of the spectrum and Gelfand transform is in the following result, which

allows us to replace the analysis of functions in C(R) with functions on a compact space.
Theorem 3 (Gelfand-Naimark). Let A be a C∗ algebra. Then G is an isometric isomorphism
of A into C(∆(A)).

The mean value operator M is a bounded linear functional on A. By identifying A with
C(∆(A)) using the Gelfand transform, and applying the Riesz representation theorem we
arrive at the following proposition, the observation of which forms the basis of Nguetseng’s
formalism of Homogenization Structures [30, 31].

Proposition 4. Let A be an algebra w.m.v.. Then the mean value operator M is represented
by a Radon probability measure β on ∆(A), i.e. for all f ∈ A we have:

(26)

M(f ) = Z∆(A) bf (s) dβ(s).

18

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

This allows us to introduce the space L2(∆(A)) := L2(∆(A), dβ). Note that β may not
be supported on the whole of ∆(A). Indeed, in the Example 2 below it is a Dirac mass at
a single point.

3.3. Examples of algebras with mean value. To give some intuition for these objects
we provide some examples.

Example 1 (Periodic functions). Let A be the set of continuous functions from R to C
which are periodic with period L. Then the characters s ∈ ∆(A) are the maps deﬁned by
st(f ) = f (t) for t ∈ R/(LZ), so that ∆(A) can be identiﬁed with the torus of length L. The
Gelfand transform takes f ∈ A ⊂ C(R) to its representative on the torus. The mean value
operator M is given by

M(f ) = Z∆(A) bf (s) dβ(s) =

1
L

LZ0

f (τ ) dτ.

Example 2 (Functions that converge at inﬁnity). Let A be the space of continuous functions
f : R → C that converge to a limit at inﬁnity, i.e. lim|τ |→∞ f (τ ) exists. Then the spectrum
∆(A) are the point evaluation maps st(f ) = f (t) for t ∈ R ∪ {∞}, and the spectrum can be
identiﬁed with ¯R the one point compactiﬁcation of R. Under this identiﬁcation, the Gelfand

transform takes a function f ∈ A to a function bf : ¯R → C with bf (t) = f (t) for t ∈ R and
bf (∞) = lim|τ |→∞ f (τ ). The mean value operator M acts by M(f ) = bf (∞).

Example 3 (Almost-periodic functions). Let T(R) denote the set of all trigonometric poly-
nomials, i.e. all f (t) that are ﬁnite linear combinations of the functions in the set

n cos(kt), sin(kt) : k ∈ Ro.

The space of almost-periodic functions in the sense of Bohr [11] is the closure of T(R) in
the supremum norm.

A function f (t) ∈ L2

loc(R) is called almost-periodic in the sense of Besicovitch if there is
a sequence in T(R) that converges to u in the Besicovitch semi-norm (given by (28) below).

A function f (t) ∈ BUC(R) is said to be almost-periodic if the set of translates

(27)

is relatively compact in BUC(R).

nf (· − a) : a ∈ Ro

All the above three deﬁnitions of almost-periodic functions are equivalent [25].
We also give the example of weakly almost periodic functions due to Eberlein [16].

Example 4 (Weakly almost-periodic functions). A continuous function f (t) ∈ BUC(R) is
weakly almost periodic if the set of translates (27) is relatively weakly compact in BUC(R).

Readers are to consult [37] for more information on the space of weakly almost-periodic

functions.

A inherits the translation invariance (in the sense

under (28). The mean value operator M extends to a bilinear form M(f g) on B2
a standard result (see e.g.
between B2 and L2(∆(A)). Note that B2

Deﬁnition 5 (Ergodic algebra w.m.v.). An algebra w.m.v. A is said to be ergodic if any
f ∈ B2

A satisfying

kf (·) − f (· − a)kB2

A

= 0

for all a ∈ R

is equivalent in B2

A to a constant.

It is easy to see that the constant in Deﬁnition 5 must be M(f ).

Remark 9. All of the examples of algebras w.m.v. given in Subsection 3.3 are ergodic.

For our purposes the importance of ergodicity of an algebra w.m.v. is the following lemma,

whose proof may be found in [7].

Lemma 3. Let A be an ergodic algebra w.m.v. and f ∈ B2
g ∈ A with dg

dτ ∈ A we have:

A have the property that, for any

M(cid:18)f

dg

dτ(cid:19) = Z∆(A) bf (s)cdg

(s) dβ(s) = 0

dτ

where the ﬁrst equality is automatic. Then f = M(f ) in B2
β-almost everywhere.

A and equivalently bf = M(f )

3.5. Product algebras and vector valued algebras. We wish to consider continuous
functions f (τ, y) for which heuristically ‘f is in A as a function of τ ’ and ‘f is in C(Td) as a
function of y’. To make sense of this, we recall that the tensor product A ⊗ C(Td) is deﬁned
by

A ⊗ C(Td) :=( NXi=1

figi : N ∈ N, f1, . . . , fN ∈ A, and g1, . . . , gN ∈ C(Td))

and we deﬁne A ⊙ C(Td) as the closure of A ⊗ C(Td) in the Banach algebra BUC(R × Td).
Note that by construction A ⊗ C(Td) is dense in A ⊙ C(Td). More discussion of product
algebras may be found in [30, 31].

We will often need to use vector valued algebras of functions mapping to Cd. This poses

essentially no additional complications; we refer the reader to e.g. [7] for details.

3.6. Σ-convergence along ﬂows. Throughout this section we shall consider a ﬂow Φτ (x) :
R × Rd → Rd. One might think of Φτ (x) as the ﬂow of an autonomous ODE

˙X = ¯b(X),

as was considered in Section 2, but this assumption will not be needed in this section. We
will, however, make the following assumptions on the ﬂow Φτ (x).

Assumption 2. We assume that the ﬂow Φτ (x) satisﬁes the following:

(i) Φτ (x) is continuously diﬀerentiable from R × Rd to Rd.
(ii) Φτ (x) satisﬁes the group property, i.e. Φt(Φs(x)) = Φt+s(x) for all t, s ∈ R and

x ∈ Rd.

(iii) The Jacobian J of Φτ (x) deﬁned by (13) is an uniformly bounded function of τ ,

locally uniformly in x, i.e. for any compact K ⊂ Rd we have

sup
x∈K

sup
τ ∈R

|J(τ, x)| < ∞.

(iv) For any τ ∈ R, Φτ (x) is volume preserving, i.e. det(J(τ, x)) = 1.

We now deﬁne the notion of weak Σ-convergence along ﬂows, which generalizes the notion
of two-scale convergence with drift introduced in [27] and also the notion of Σ-convergence
introduced in [30].

Deﬁnition 6 (weak Σ-convergence along ﬂow). Let A be an algebra w.m.v.. Suppose Φτ (x)
be a ﬂow satisfying Assumption 2 and let uε(t, x) be a sequence in L2((0, T ) × Rd). We say
that uε weakly Σ-converges along Φτ (x) to a limit u0(t, X, s, y) ∈ L2((0, T )×Rd ×∆(A)×Td)
if, for any smooth test function ψ(t, X, τ, y) which is periodic in the y variable and belongs
to A in the τ variable, we have

A ⊙ C(Td) is deﬁned in subsection 3.5.

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0.
Notation: We denote the weak Σ-convergence along ﬂow Φτ (x) by uε
Convention: Whenever the limit (29) holds, we call u0 the Σ-Φτ weak limit of uε.

Remark 10. The test functions in (29) are taken along rapidly moving coordinates in their
second variable. This is analogous to the choice of test functions in the theory of two-scale
convergence with drift [27, 2]. Note also that the the Σ-Φτ weak limit of the family uε(t, x)
depends on the choice of the ﬂow Φτ (x). It should be noted that when Φτ (x) = x for all

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

21

τ ∈ R and for each x ∈ Rd, i.e. when the test functions in (29) are taken on a ﬁxed
coordinate system, the weak convergence given in Deﬁnition 6 coincides with the notion of
weak Σ-convergence with regard to the product algebra A ⊙ C(Td) developed in [33, 37].

Remark 11. Deﬁnition 6 makes sense even for test functions ψ(t, x, τ ) without oscillations
in space, and in this case the limit u0 will be a function of (t, x, s) only.

3.7. Compactness. To show that the Deﬁnition 6 is not empty, we give the following
weak-compactness result, which is the main result of this section.

Theorem 5. Let A be an algebra w.m.v.. Suppose Φτ (x) be a ﬂow satisfying Assumption
2 and let uε(t, x) be a uniformly (with respect to ε) bounded sequence in L2((0, T ) × Rd).
Then there exists a subsequence (still denoted uε) and a limit u0(t, X, s, y) ∈ L2((0, T ) ×
Rd × ∆(A) × Td) such that

in the sense of Deﬁnition 6.

uε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0

To prove the above theorem, we will follow the method of Casado-Díaz and Gayte [13],
as we would like to consider algebras which are not separable. To that end, we will need
the following result from [13].

Theorem 6 (Casado-Díaz and Gayte, Theorem 2.1. [13]). Let X be a subspace (not neces-
sarily closed) of a reﬂexive space Y and let fn : X → R be a sequence of linear functionals
(not necessarily continuous). Assume there exists a constant C > 0 which satisﬁes

lim sup

n→∞

|fn(x)| ≤ Ckxk,

∀x ∈ X.

Then there exists a subsequence nk and a functional f ∈ Y ′ such that

lim
k→∞

fnk(x) = f (x),

∀x ∈ X.

We will also need the following lemma, which is the main novel part of the proof.

Lemma 4. Let A be an algebra w.m.v. and let Φτ (x) be a ﬂow satisfying Assumption 2.
Take ϕ(t, X, τ, y) ∈ L2((0, T ) × Rd; A ⊙ C(Td)). Then

dx dt =

We ﬁrst consider n = 0, in which case the only x dependence of the integrand is through
h. By Fubini’s theorem we may do the x integration ﬁrst. By the coordinate change:
X = Φ−t/ε(x), which has determinant 1 by the Assumption 2.(iv), we have

so it suﬃces to show that the last integral converges to the required limit. By the deﬁnition
of the mean value operator, f (·/ε) converges L∞(R)-weak* to M(f ). As g ∈ L1(0, T ) this
completes the proof for n = 0, noting the identiﬁcation of M with β (Proposition 4).

Now suppose that n 6= 0. As in the n = 0 case we perform the x integration ﬁrst
with t ﬁxed, but this time we do not change coordinates. Deﬁne the (formally) self-adjoint
diﬀerential operator Ln = −in · ∇x. Then we have the relation

Consider the integrand on the last line. By assumption h is smooth with compact support,

where |Φ−1

for some constant C. Using this bound in the full t, x integral yields

This completes the n 6= 0 case and the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Remark 12. It is evident from the above proof that the uniform bound upon the Jacobian
(Assumption 2.(iii)) is needed only for test functions that depend upon the fast spatial vari-
able y. As a consequence, an analogous compactness result for convergence against test
functions depending only upon (t, x, τ ) can be obtained without this assumption (see Remark
11). However, Assumption 2.(iii) is needed to identify the Σ-Φτ limit of gradient sequences
(Proposition 9 below).

We are now ready to prove the compactness result.

Proof of Theorem 5. Let Y = L2((0, T ) × Rd × ∆(A) × Td) and X be the vector subspace
of Gelfand transforms of functions in L2((0, T ) × Rd; A ⊙ C(Td)). Now deﬁne the linear
functionals F ε : X ⊂ Y → R, by

By Theorem 6, we may pass to a subsequence (still indexed by ε) for which
∀ϕ ∈ L2((0, T ) × Rd; A ⊙ C(Td))

F ε( ˆϕ) → F ( ˆϕ) as ε → 0,

where F ∈ Y ′. Note that Y = L2((0, T ) × Rd × ∆(A) × Td) is a Hilbert space, (but is in
general non-separable). Therefore, by the Riesz representation theorem, F is represented
by

F ( ˆϕ) =

for some u0 ∈ L2((0, T ) × Rd × Td × ∆(A)), which is the desired limit.

(cid:3)

As is classical in the theory of two-scale convergence, we have the following result shedding
some light on the product of two sequences that converge in the sense of Σ-convergence along
ﬂows.

Theorem 7 (Limit of the product). Let uε and vε be two families in L2((0, T ) × Rd) such
that

uε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0(t, X, s, y);

vε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ v0(t, X, s, y).

Assume further that

kuεkL2((0,T )×Rd) = ku0kL2((0,T )×Rd×∆(A)×Td).

Then, we have

uε(t, x) vε(t, x) ⇀ ZZ∆(A)×Td

in the sense of distributions.

u0(t, X, s, y) v0(t, X, s, y) dβ(s) dy

The proof of Theorem 7 is by a density argument. These arguments are similar to the ones
found in [1] (see p.1488 in [1] to be precise). As the proof can be given mutatis mutatndis,
we skip the proof of Theorem 7.

Next, we recall the notion of admissible test functions given by M. Radu [35] in the context

of two-scale convergence:

Deﬁnition 7. Let ϕ ∈ L2(Ω × Td) be a function that can be approximated by a sequence of
functions ϕn ∈ C ∞(Ω; C ∞(Td)) such that for n → ∞:

Then ϕ is said to be an admissible test function.

Inspired by the above deﬁnition, we introduce the notion of admissible test functions

suitable for the notion of weak Σ-convergence along ﬂows.

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

25

Deﬁnition 8 (Admissible test functions). A function ψ(t, x, τ, y) which is periodic in the
y variable and belongs to a certain algebra w.m.v. A in the τ variable is said to be an
admissible test function if it can be approximated by a sequence of functions ψn(t, x, τ, y) ∈
C((0, T ) × Rd; A ⊙ C(Td)) such that for n → ∞:

The following result says that having coeﬃcients that are ‘admissible’ in the sense of

Deﬁnition 8 enables us to pass to the limit in the product sequence.

Lemma 5. Let A be an algebra w.m.v. and Φτ (x) be a ﬂow satisfying Assumption 2. Let
the family uε(t, x) ⊂ L2((0, T ) × Rd) be such that

uε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0(t, X, s, y).

Finally, let a(t, x, τ, y) be admissible in the sense of Deﬁnition 8. Then, for any smooth test
function ψ(t, x, τ, y) which is periodic in the y variable and which belongs to A as a function
of the τ variable, we have

The proof of Lemma 5 is by a density argument (this is inherent in the deﬁnition of
admissibility). These arguments are similar to the ones found in [35] (see p.6 in [35] to be
precise). As the proof can be given mutatis mutatndis, we skip the details.

3.8. Additional bounds on derivatives. We ﬁrst establish conditions under which the
Σ-Φt limit does not depend upon y. The following result follows the ﬂavour of standard
two-scale convergence (see e.g.
[29, 1]), where gradient bounds imply that the two-scale
limit is independent of the fast spatial variable. Here the proof is slightly complicated by
the ﬂow Φ, but is otherwise the same.

Proposition 8. Let A be an algebra w.m.v., Φ a ﬂow satisfying the Assumption 2, and
uε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0 in the sense of Deﬁnition 6. Then if

then u0 does not depend on y, i.e. u0(t, s, X, y) = u0(t, s, X).

Noting that, by linearity and as it acts in a diﬀerent variable, the Gelfand transform com-
mutes with ∇y, we deduce that u0 is orthogonal (in the L2(Td) sense) to all y-divergences
and is hence independent of y.
(cid:3)

To obtain the Σ − Φ limit of the gradient sequence ∇uε, we require that the Jacobian of

the ﬂow lie in the algebra.

Proposition 9 (Two-scale limit for the gradient sequence). Let A be an algebra w.m.v., Φ
a ﬂow satisfying Assumption 2 and J(τ, Φτ (X)) ∈ C(Rd; A). Suppose that

uε

Σ−Φτ−−−−⇀ u0

and

∇uε

for some u1(t, X, s, y) ∈ L2(R+ × Rd × ∆(A); H 1(Td)).

v0 = ⊤ˆ˜J(s, X)∇Xu0 + ∇yu1

Remark 13. The above result diﬀers from the classical result for two-scale convergence (see
e.g. [1]) and two-scale convergence with constant drift [27, 2], in the presence of the Jacobian
of the ﬂow, which depends on the fast time variable, in the limit. If the ﬂow Φ is taken to
be a constant drift ﬂow Φτ (x) = x + b∗τ then the Jacobian is the identity matrix.

Proof of Proposition 9. Note that u0 is independent of y by Proposition 8. We test against
c (R+ × Rd × Td; A)]d which satisfy ∇y · Ψ = 0. By integration by parts we

Thus the bracketed expression in the above integrand is orthogonal (in the L2(Td) sense)
to y-divergence free vector ﬁelds, and is hence equal to the y-gradient of some function u1.
Basic Fourier analysis in Td tells us that u1 is bounded in L2(R+ × Rd × ∆(A); H 1(Td)).
This completes the proof of the Proposition.

4.1. Qualitative analysis. The compactness results (Theorem 5, Proposition 9) of previ-
ous section demand uniform (with respect to ε) estimates on the solution family {uε(t, x)}
and on the family of derivatives (in space) of the solution family {∇uε(t, x)}.
Lemma 6. Suppose the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) ∈ L∞(Rd ×Td; Rd) is incompressible in both x and
y variables, i.e. satisfying (5). Suppose the molecular diﬀusion tensor D(x, y) ∈ L∞(Rd ×
Td; Rd×d) is uniformly coercive, i.e. satisfying (7). Suppose the initial data uin(x) ∈ L2(Rd).
Then we have uniform (with respect to ε) a priori estimates on the solutions to (8a)-(8b)
given by

(31)

kuεkL∞([0,T ];L2(Rd)) + k∇uεkL2((0,T )×Rd) ≤ CkuinkL2(Rd),

for any arbitrary time T > 0. The constant C in (31) is independent of ε and the time
instant T .

As the proof of the above lemma is very classical and follows the energy method, we
shall skip the details. Now, we state the following result showing that our model problem
(8a)-(8b) is well-posed.
Proposition 10. Suppose the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) ∈ L∞(Rd × Td; Rd) is incompressible in both
x and y variables, i.e. satisfying (5). Suppose further that the diﬀusion tensor D(x, y) ∈
L∞(Rd × Td; Rd×d) is uniformly coercive, i.e. satisfying (7). Suppose the initial data uin ∈
L2(Rd). Then, for any ﬁxed ε > 0, there exists a unique solution uε ∈ L2((0, T ); H 1(Rd)) ∩
C 1((0, T ); L2(Rd)) to (8a)-(8b).

For any ﬁxed ε > 0, we can use the a priori bounds (31) and the Galerkin method to
prove the above result. As this approach is very well-established (see Chapter 7 in [18] if
necessary), we shall skip the proof of the above result as well.

Remark 14. The regularity of the coeﬃcients in (8a) considered in Lemma 6 and Proposi-
tion 10 are quite weak. We shall impose some stronger regularity assumptions on the ﬂuid
ﬁeld b(x, y) when we get to the homogenization result later in this section.

We denote the diﬀerence between the mean-ﬁeld and the locally periodic ﬂuid ﬁeld by

(32)

F (x, y) := ¯b(x) − b(x, y),

for (x, y) ∈ Rd × Td.

Remark 15. We specialise the main result to the 3 dimensional case. All the arguments to
follow can be cast in the language of diﬀerential forms to generalize the theory to dimensions
d ≥ 2, but to simplify presentation and increase accessibility of the proof, we leave this
extension to the reader.

The null-divergence assumption on the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) in the y variable implies that
F (x, y) is divergence free in the y-variable. Helmholtz decomposition of vector ﬁelds on the
torus T3 yields the following result.
Lemma 7. There exists Υ(x, y) ∈ [L2(R3; H 1(T3))]3 such that

F (x, y) = ∇y × Υ(x, y);

Υ(x, y) dy = 0.

4.2. Assumptions. In this subsection we shall make precise the assumptions on the ﬂuid
ﬁeld b(x, y), the mean ﬁeld ¯b(x) and the Jacobian matrix J(τ, x) associated with the ﬂow
Φτ . Throughout, we will assume that A is a ﬁxed given ergodic algebra w.m.v.. See Section
5 for further discussions on the assumptions made here.

Assumption 3. The ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) belongs to C 1(R3×T3; R3) and its ﬂow-representation
belongs to A as follows:

˜b(τ, x, y) = b(Φτ (x), y) ∈ [C 1(R3 × T3; A)]3.

Remark 16. The mean-ﬁeld ¯b(x) is nothing but the y-average of the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y).
The regularity hypothesis in Assumption 3 implies that ¯b(x) ∈ C 1(R3; R3). Furthermore,
the linearity of A implies that the ﬂow-representation of the mean-ﬁeld belongs to A as
follows:

˜¯b(τ, x) = ¯b(Φτ (x)) ∈ [C 1(R3; A)]3.

Assumption 4. The ﬁeld ∇x ×F (x, y) ∈ C(R3 ×T3; R3) and its ﬂow-representation belongs
to A as follows:

^∇x × F(τ, x, y) = ∇x × F (Φτ (x), y) ∈ [C(R3 × T3; A)]3.

Remark 17. Lemma 7 implies the ﬂow-representation of Υ is given by a convolution in the
y-variable of a Greens function and the ﬂow-representation of F . The linearity of A allows
us deduce that the ﬂow-representation of Υ(x, y) belongs to A as follows:

˜Υ(τ, x, y) = Υ(Φτ (x), y) ∈ [C 1(R3 × T3; A)]3.

Remark 18. Observe that ζ := ∇x × Υ solves the equation ∇y × ζ = ∇x × F . Hence a
similar argument as in Remark 17 and the hypothesis in Assumption 4 implies that ζ belongs
to A as follows:

˜ζ(τ, x, y) = ^∇x × Υ(τ, x, y) = ∇x × Υ(Φτ (x), y) ∈ [C(R3 × T3; A)]3.

Assumption 5. The molecular diﬀusion matrix D(x, y) ∈ [L∞(R3; C(T3))]3×3 and its ﬂow-
representation belongs to A as follows:

˜D(τ, x, y) = D(Φτ (x), y) ∈ [L∞(R3; C(T3) ⊙ A)]3×3.

Assumption 6. The Jacobian matrix associated with the ﬂow Φ has the regularity J(τ, x) ∈
[L∞(R3; A)]3×3 and its ﬂow-representation belongs to A as follows:

˜J(τ, x) = J(τ, Φτ (x)) ∈ [L∞(R3; A)]3×3.

30

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

Remark 19. Assumption 5 is trivially satisﬁed if the molecular diﬀusion is purely periodic
and bounded, i.e. D(x, y) ≡ D(y) ∈ [L∞(T3)]3×3. Similarly, that the ﬂow representation of
b belongs to A as in Assumption 3 follows from Assumption 6 if the ﬂuid ﬁeld b has the
special form:

b(x, y) = ¯b(x) + b1(y).

This may be seen from using Lemma 1.(iv) to write

˜b(τ, X, y) = ˜¯b(τ, X) + b1(y) =(cid:16) ˜J(τ, X)(cid:17)−1

¯b(X) + b1(y).

Remark 20. The assumptions on the coeﬃcients and the Jacobian matrix (Assumption 3
- Assumption 6) ensure that they are admissible test functions in the sense of Deﬁnition 8.

Next, we state our main result on the homogenization of the scaled convection-diﬀusion

equation (8a)-(8b).

Theorem 11. Let Φτ be the ﬂow associated with the three dimensional autonomous sys-
tem (11). Suppose uε(t, x) be the family of solutions associated with the scaled convection-
diﬀusion equation (8a)-(8b). Suppose u0(t, X) be the Σ-Φτ limit associated with the solution
family. Suppose the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) satisﬁes the Assumption 3, the molecular diﬀusion
D(x, y) satisﬁes the Assumption 5, the Jacobian matrix J(τ, x) satisﬁes the Assumption 6
and the ﬁeld F (x, y) given by (32) satisﬁes the Assumption 4. Then the limit u0(t, X) solves

This equation is identical to that given in the formal homogenisation result Proposition 1,
which may be seen from the identity (26). In particular, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D may be
computed using (20)-(21), and the limits therein exist and are ﬁnite.

Theorem 11 asserts that a Σ-Φτ of the solution family uε(t, x) solves the homogenized
equation (38)-(39). The rest of the section is devoted to proving this result. In Lemma 8,
we ﬁrst prove that we can extract subsequences oﬀ the solution family {uε} and the gradient
sequence {∇uε} such that the extracted subsequences admit Σ-Φτ limits. Lemma 8 also
proves that the Σ-Φτ limit u0 is independent of the s variable.

Inspired by the structure of the Σ-Φτ limits in Lemma 8, we make a particular choice of the
test functions (in Subsection 4.4) in the weak formulation of the scaled convection-diﬀusion
(8a)-(8b).

As we need to pass to the limit in some singular terms in the weak formulation, we prove
the limit behaviour of the those singular terms in Lemma 9. In Subsection 4.6, we derive
the cell problem. Finally, in Subsection 4.7, we give the proof of Theorem 11.

Remark 22. Even though the Σ-Φτ compactness results are upto extraction of a subse-
quence, the entire sequence uε does converge to the Σ-Φτ limit u0 as the homogenized equa-
tion is uniquely solvable (Proposition 2).

4.3. Σ-compactness along the ﬂow Φτ .

Lemma 8. Let uε(t, x) be the family of solutions to (8a)-(8b). Then, there exists a sub-
sequence (still indexed by ε) and limits u0(t, X) ∈ L2((0, T ); H 1(R3)), u1(t, X, s, y) ∈ L2((0, T )×
R3 × ∆(A); H 1(T3)) such that

(40)

(41)

Proof. The a priori bounds from Lemma 6 give us the necessary uniform bounds (with
respect to ε) so that the result of Proposition 9 implies the existence of u0(t, X, s) and
u1(t, X, s, y) such that (40) and (41) hold. To prove that u0 is independent of the s variable,
we shall consider the weak formulation of the ε-problem (8a)-(8b) with the test function
∂τ (t, x, ·) ∈ A. The weak formulation

By construction, Υ is of zero average in the y variable (Lemma 7). Hence the ﬁrst term in

5. Discussion of assumptions

In this section we discuss the assumptions (detailed in Section 4.2) of the homogenization
result (Theorem 11) and give both the examples where they are satisﬁed and counterexam-
ples where the failure of these assumptions can lead either to trivial or non-unique limits.
We remark that the main obstacle to obtaining homogenization results in our setting is, in
fact, not related to the oscillating coeﬃcients, but rather to deriving an eﬀective equation
in Lagrangian coordinates.

5.1. Bounds on the Jacobian. The main restriction on the ﬂuid ﬂow is Assumption 6
which implies that the Jacobian of the ﬂow is uniformly bounded in time. This is a highly
non-generic assumption, but is needed for the validity of the posited asymptotic expansion
(4). Indeed, if the Jacobian is not uniformly bounded in time, then, for example, the right
hand side of the O(ε0) equation in the cascade (24) may grow to be of O(ε−1) for suﬃciently
large values of the fast time variable τ , breaking the formal expansion. First we shall give
some examples of mean ﬂuid ﬁelds which obey this assumption, which although restrictive,
still covers a large class of vector ﬁelds.

Example 5 (Constant drift). The most obvious example is the constant drift ﬂow ¯b(x) = b∗
for a constant vector b∗ ∈ Rd. In this case the Jacobian matrix is the identity for all times.
This case falls under the regime of two-scale convergence with drift studied in [34, 3].

Example 6 (Euclidean motions). Euclidean motions are the composition of a translation
and a rigid rotation. An autonomous ﬂow consists of Euclidean motions if and only if the
vector ﬁeld is given by ¯b(x) = Ax + b∗ for a constant skew-symmetric matrix A and a
constant vector b∗. The associated Jacobian matrix is an orthogonal matrix and hence of
norm 1.

Example 7 (Asymptotically constant drift). Let the mean ﬂow ¯b in dimension d ≥ 2 be
given by

where R > 0, e1 · b∗, e1 · b∗∗ > 0 and c(x) is chosen to make ¯b continuously diﬀerentiable
and divergence free. To ensure that the Jacobian of the ﬂow is uniformly bounded in time we
require that any integral curve spends only ﬁnite time T in {x1 ∈ [−R, R]}, which implies
that the Jacobian is norm bounded by C exp(T k∇ckL∞). This can easily be achieved by
requiring that e1 · c(x) ≥ c > 0.

We remark also that the Jacobian in each of these examples belongs to some algebra
w.m.v., speciﬁcally the Jacobian in Examples 5 and 7 belong to the algebra of functions
that converge at inﬁnity (see Example 2), and the Jacobian in Example 6 belongs to the
algebra of almost periodic functions (see Example 3).

5.2. Necessity of uniformly bounded Jacobian. The assumption of uniform bounds on
the Jacobian is not a mere technical assumption. We illustrate this with a counterexample,
which we have made as simple as possible to allow explicit calculations.

Counterexample 1 (Blow-up of the Jacobian for a shear ﬂow). Consider the simplest
example of a shear ﬂow:

An easy computation gives that the ﬂow Φ generated by this vector ﬁeld and its Jacobian are
given by

0(cid:21) .
¯b(x1, x2) =(cid:20)x2
J(−τ, x) =(cid:20)1 τ
0 1(cid:21) .

(cid:21) ,

Φτ (x1, x2) =(cid:20)x1 + τ x2

In particular, the Jacobian grows linearly in time.

Consider the parabolic problem on ]0, T [×R2 given by

¯b(x1, x2) · ∇uε − ∆uε = 0

where the O(ε−2) equation is trivial due to the lack of oscillating coeﬃcients. But this
cascade is only valid for times τ ≪ ε−1/2, as at this value of τ the (1 + τ 2) coeﬃcient in the
posited O(ε0) equation jumps order. To be a valid asymptotic expansion for the parabolic
problem (56), we require it to be valid for τ ∈ [0, T /ε], i.e. up to O(ε−1) values of τ . This
means that the posited asymptotic expansion cannot be correct.

Indeed, the problem (56) can be explicitly solved using the Fourier transform. Let (ξ1, ξ2)

be Fourier variables corresponding to (X1, X2). Then an easy computation yields

ˆuε(t, ξ1, ξ2) = exp(cid:18)Z t

(where we have abused notation and used ˆ· to denote the Fourier instead of Gelfand trans-
form). The integrand in the above exponential converges pointwise to −∞ as ε → 0 so long
as sξ1 6= 0. Therefore, ˆu → 0 almost everywhere in [0, T ] × R2 as ε → 0, and it follows from

42

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

dominated convergence and Plancherel’s theorem that uε → 0 strongly in L2([0, T ] × R2).
So, not only is the asymptotic expansion not correct, but the limit as ε → 0 is trivial.

This counterexample illustrates a general phenomenon for shear ﬂows, where the convec-
tion enhances the diﬀusion (see for example [19] where this is considered in detail for the
more complicated case of cats eye ﬂows, and [21, 14, 9] where conditions under which the
solution converges strongly to zero are studied). As a consequence of this enhancement, the
time scale on which diﬀusion is observed is diﬀerent and one should not expect to obtain
a non-trivial limit in the scaling we consider. We give a partial result to this eﬀect below.
The authors shall address this problem in a forthcoming publication [23].

Proposition 13. Let the assumptions of Proposition 10 hold and uε be the solution to (8a)-
(8b). Let vε be the solution in Lagrangian coordinates, i.e. vε(t, X) = uε(t, Φt/ε(X)). Let
ξ ∈ Rd be a unit vector, and suppose that for some (non-empty) open set A ⊂ Rd we have,
for X ∈ A,

(57)

lim
τ →∞

|⊤eJ(τ, X)ξ| = ∞.

Then for any v0 a L2((0, T ); H 1(Rd))-weak limit of vε, we have ξ · ∇Xv0 = 0 on (0, T ) × A.
Remark 23. As the set A is independent of the choice of initial data uin, the initial data
can be chosen so that v0 6∈ C([0, T ]; L2(Rd)), and in particular so that v0 does not solve a
‘nice’ parabolic PDE with this initial datum.

Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume that A is bounded, and by applying
Egorov’s theorem it is suﬃcient to prove the claim for A measurable with the limit (57)
uniform on A. By converting (31) to Lagrangian coordinates, we have the estimate

|⊤eJ(t/ε, X)∇Xvε(t, X)|2 dXdt ≤ C

That ξ · ∇Xv0 = 0 on (t0, A) follows from upper semi-continuity under weak convergence.
That this holds for (0, T ) × A follows as t0 was arbitrary.
(cid:3)

5.3. Flow representations of coeﬃcients. The main assumptions upon the coeﬃcients
b(x, y) and D(x, y) is their ﬂow representations ˜b(τ, X, y) and ˜D(τ, x, y) belong to some
ﬁxed algebra w.m.v. A. The reason we require this is to ensure that we obtain a single
unique homogenized equation. This is in contrast to the uniform bounds on the Jacobian,
which as described above, we require in order to be sure that we can obtain any non-trivial
limit. We illustrate the non-uniqueness phenomenon with the following counterexample.
We remark that, again, the diﬃculty is present without any rapid spatial oscillations, or
complicated mean ﬂows.

none of our results apply to this problem.

One might think that the failure of the asymptotic expansion in the above counterexample
could be rectiﬁed by some smarter choice of expansion. However, this is not the case. For
this counterexample it is impossible to obtain a unique homogenised equation as we will
now show.

We will now show the convergence vεn to u0. The argument for vε′

We remark that, although the above counterexample features bad behaviour in the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient, similar examples could be constructed where the undesirable behaviour
is in the drift term ¯b (or b) or the Jacobian J. The issue here is the appearance of the
spatial scale x = O(ε−1) in the problem due to the O(ε−1) mean drift. Such a scale is not
present when the average convection is zero, i.e. ¯b = 0, even in the convection dominated
regime. This additional spatial scale is exploited in the choice of diﬀusion coeﬃcient (59),
which exhibits diﬀerent behaviour at a sequence of spatial scales tending to inﬁnity.

Next we show that this bad behaviour is a problem only at inﬁnity, in the sense that if

the trajectories of Φ are bounded, then our assumptions always hold.

Proposition 15. Let Assumption 1 hold. Then exactly one of the following hold:

(i) Φτ has bounded orbits, i.e. for any x the set {Φτ (x) : τ ∈ R} is bounded.
(ii) Φτ converges to inﬁnity, i.e. for any x we have |Φτ (x)| → ∞ as |τ | → ∞.
Let AP denote the algebra of almost-periodic functions (Example 3). In each respective case
the following also holds:

(i) Φt is uniformly almost-periodic, i.e. Φt(x) ∈ [C(Rd; AP)]d. For every f (x, y) ∈ C(Rd×
Td), the ﬂow-representation is uniformly almost-periodic, i.e. ˜f ∈ C(Rd × Td; AP). If
additionally J(τ, x) is uniformly continuous on R × K for each compact set K ⊂ Rd,
then J and ˜J are uniformly almost-periodic, i.e. J, ˜J ∈ [C(Rd; AP)]d×d.

(ii) Let f ∈ C(Rd × Td) converge to a limit as |x| → ∞, i.e. lim|x|→∞ f (x, y) exists and is
ﬁnite for each y ∈ Td. Then for each x, y ∈ Rd × Td, the ﬂow-representation ˜f (·, x, y)
belongs to the algebra of functions that converge at inﬁnity (Example 2).

Remark 24. The almost-periodicity of the Jacobian of an (locally) uniformly almost-periodic
ﬂow is a subtle issue as there are uniformly almost-periodic functions whose derivative is
not uniformly almost-periodic. The assumption in (i) that J is uniformly continuous is to
side steps this issue.

To prove this proposition we have need a deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 9 (Equicontinuous ﬂow). A one-parameter group φτ of homeomorphisms of
K ⊆ Rd is equicontinuous if for any ε > 0 and x ∈ KR there is a δ = δ(x, ε) such that
whenever |x′ − x| ≤ δ and x′ ∈ K it holds that |φτ (x) − φτ (x′)| ≤ ε for all τ ∈ R.
Proof of Proposition 15. We ﬁrst prove the dichotomy. Let x ∈ Rd be ﬁxed. We ﬁrst claim
that either |Φτ (x)| → ∞ as |τ | → ∞ or its orbit is bounded. Suppose |Φτ (x)| 6→ ∞ as
|τ | → ∞, then there must be a compact set K containing x and a sequence of times τn with
|τn| → ∞ as n → ∞ and Φτn(x) ∈ K. Without loss of generality let 0 < τ1 < τ2 · · · . By
integrating Assumption 1, for any n ≥ 1 it holds that

sup

τn≤τ ≤τn+1

|Φτ (x) − Φτ −τn(x)| ≤ C|Φτn(x) − x| ≤ C diam(K)

and hence the forward orbit is bounded. We now claim that the backwards orbit is also
bounded. Indeed, let s > 0 be arbitrary, then, using Assumption 1 once more we have

|Φ−s(x) − x| = |Φ−s(x) − Φ−s(Φs(x))| ≤ C|x − Φs(x)|

and the right hand side is bounded uniformly in s > 0.

We have shown that the dichotomy holds for some ﬁxed x, but this together with Assump-
tion 1 imply that the same dichotomy holds for all x. Indeed, consider the orbit starting
from an arbitrary x′, then

|Φτ (x) − Φτ (x′)| ≤ C|x − x′| < ∞

sup
τ ∈R

which we obtain by again integrating Assumption 1. This implies that if the orbit of x is
bounded (resp. converges to inﬁnity) then the orbit of x′ is bounded (resp. converges to
inﬁnity).

We now prove the claims, starting with (i). Let R > 0 be arbitrary, then the set

KR = {Φτ (x) : τ ∈ R, |x| ≤ R}

is invariant under Φτ and compact. Moreover, the KR are nested and cover Rd. It is thus
suﬃcient to prove the claims on KR. Note that (Φτ , K, | · |) is a compact dynamical system,
and Assumption 1 implies that it is equicontinuous in the sense of the above deﬁnition.
It is a classical result of topological dynamical systems (see e.g.
[17]) that for compact
dynamical systems the property of equicontinuity is equivalent to being uniformly almost-
periodic, in the sense that Φτ (x) ∈ [C(KR; AP)]d. Now suppose that f ∈ C(Rd × Td),
then f is uniformly continuous on KR × Td as this set is compact. Moreover, as KR is
invariant under Φτ the function ˜f (τ, x, y) restricted to x ∈ KR depends only on f restricted
to KR × Td. Hence ˜f (τ, x, y) = f (Φτ (x), y) (restricted to x ∈ KR) is the composition of a
uniformly continuous function and a uniformly almost-periodic function, and is uniformly
almost-periodic. Finally, suppose that J is uniformly continuous on R × KR, then the
diﬀerence quotients deﬁned for any unit vector ξ ∈ Rd, by

Jh(τ, x)ξ =

Φ−τ (x + hξ) − Φ−τ (x)

|h|

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

47

converge in [C(KR/2×R)]d as R ∋ h → 0 to J(τ, x)ξ. As both terms in the diﬀerence quotient
are uniformly almost-periodic the limit is also. That ˜J is uniformly almost-periodic can be
proved in the same way.

Now we prove the claim for (ii). Let f (x, y) ∈ C(Rd × Td) be as assumed and converge
to g(y) as |x| → ∞. Clearly ˜f (τ, x, y) → g(y) as |τ | → ∞, it only remains to show that ˜f
is uniformly continuous. To this end, note that f is continuous on Rd × T where Rd is the
one-point compactiﬁcation of Rd. As this set is compact, f is uniformly continuous on this
set. Moreover, as Φτ (x) is uniformly continuous from R × Rd to Rd, the composition ˜f is
uniformly continuous, which completes the proof of the proposition.

using the Σ-Φτ convergence.

we consider the Σ-Φτ convergence with no oscillations in space, i.e. with test functions

k∇uεkL2((0,T )×Rd) ≤ C.

The compactness results in two-scale convergence with drift theory implies the existence of
u0 ∈ L2((0, T ); H 1(Rd)) and u1 ∈ L2((0, T ) × Rd; H 1(Td)) such that

We can pass to the limit in almost all the terms in above expression except for the fourth
term on the left hand side. This is essentially because the product h1 (x, y) ψ (t, x) does not
form an admissible test function in the sense of Deﬁnition 8. However, if we consider the ﬂow

representation of the ﬂuid ﬁeld h1(x, y) and assume thatfh1(·, x, y) ∈ A for certain ergodic
algebra w.m.v. A, then the productfh1(τ, x, y)ψ(t, x) forms an admissible test function in

the sense of Deﬁnition 8. Thus, using the notion of weak Σ-Φτ convergence, we can prove
the following result. The proof of which is a simple adaptation of the calculations already
present in Section 4. Hence is left to the reader.

Theorem 16. Suppose the ﬂow representation of the ﬂuid ﬁeld h(x, y) belongs to an ergodic
algebra w.m.v. A. The two-scale with drift h∗ limits for the solution family uε obtained in
(67) satisfy the homogenized equation

(69)

and the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the homogenized equation is given by

h(x) = ZZ∆(A)×Tdcfh1(s, x, y) dβ(s) dy
D(y)(cid:16)∇yωj(y) + ej(cid:17) ·(cid:16)∇yωi(y) + ei(cid:17) dy

for i, j ∈ {1, · · · , d} where the ωi solve the cell problem

h(y) · (∇yωi + ei) − ∇y · (D(y) (∇yωi + ei)) = h∗ · ei

in Td.

Remark that, due to particular choice of the ﬂuid ﬁeld (65), the ﬁeld h1(x, x

ε ) only con-
tributes to the homogenized equation (68) via the convective ﬁeld (69) and not the eﬀective

50

THOMAS HOLDING, HARSHA HUTRIDURGA, AND JEFFREY RAUCH

diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Only the ﬂuid ﬁeld of O(ε−1) contribute the dispersive eﬀects in the
eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

Remark also that even in the constant drift scenario, the previously known two-scale
convergence with drift developed in [27] has a handicap in dealing with coeﬃcients that
depend on the macroscopic variable. Hence, the notion of weak convergence developed
in this work generalizes the known multiple scale techniques (in the spirit of two-scale
convergence of Nguetseng and Allaire) in homogenization theory to a great extent.

7. Conclusion

The structural assumption of periodicity (in the y variable) on the ﬂuid ﬁeld b(x, y) made
in the previous sections is for the sake of simplicity. We can indeed develop a theory of Σ-
convergence along ﬂows (similar to the theory developed in Section 3) under the assumption
that the oscillations in space belong to certain ergodic algebra with mean value. To be precise,
suppose b(x, y) a smooth ﬂuid ﬁeld which belongs to an ergodic algebra w.m.v. (say A1)
in the y variable. By the deﬁnition of algebra w.m.v. (precisely, property (iii) in Deﬁnition
1), b(x, ·) ∈ A1 possesses a mean value, i.e.

b(cid:16)x,

x

ε(cid:17) ⇀ M b(x)

in L∞(Rd)-weak* as ε → 0.

In this scenario, we take the mean ﬁeld ¯b(x) = M b(x) and consider the ﬂow Φτ associated
with this mean ﬁeld. To extend the notion of Σ-convergence along ﬂows (Deﬁnition 6), we
need to essentially characterize the limit

ε→0 ZZ

lim

(0,T )×Rd

uε(t, x)ψ(cid:18)t,

, Φ−t/ε(x),

where the test function ψ(t, τ, x, y) belongs to an ergodic algebra w.m.v.
(say A2) as a
function of the fast time variable τ and belongs to an ergodic algebra w.m.v. A1 as a function
of the y variable. To prove compactness result, in the spirit of Theorem 5, the approach is to
consider the diﬀerentiation theory developed in the context of algebras w.m.v. developed in
[30, 31, 13, 37]. We also need to approach it use the reiterated homogenization techniques
as in [32]. The eﬀective diﬀusion matrix obtained under the periodicity assumption (see
(36)-(37)) is given in terms of the cell solutions obtained by solving elliptic problems on a
torus. In this general setting, however, the expressions for eﬀective diﬀusion shall involve
solutions to some variational problems solved on the spectrum of the algebra w.m.v., i.e.
∆(A1) (cf. the works of Nguetseng [30, 31]). This potential theory of Σ-convergence along
ﬂows in a more general setting is quite intricate and the authors will address this theory in
future publications.

As is evident from Subsection 5.3, even in the constant drift case, one can only homogenize
the convection-diﬀusion problems in strong convection regime provided the ﬂow representa-
tion of the diﬀusion matrix belongs to an algebra w.m.v., i.e. satisﬁes Assumption 5.

All along this article, we have considered time-independent coeﬃcients. This resulted
in the study of autonomous ordinary diﬀerential systems (see (11)). Considering ﬂows

CONVERGENCE ALONG MEAN FLOWS

51

associated with non-autonomous systems would be interesting. But, the authors believe
that the analysis would be very complicated and it remains to be checked if we can get
compactness results (in the spirit of Theorem 5) for non-autonomous ﬂows.

The assumption that the Jacobian matrices are bounded functions of the fast time variable
is quite non-generic (see Section 5). To lift this assumption would require an enormous
amount of work in the theory of Banach algebras. The main diﬃculty is the appearance
of new time scales (as is evident from the shear ﬂow case considered in Example 1). This
problem largely remains to be solved. A partial result in this direction shall be given by the
authors in a forthcoming publication [23].

Finally, the assumption of incompressibility on the ﬂuid ﬁeld has ensured that the asso-
ciated ﬂows are volume preserving (see (iv) in Assumption 2). This property of the ﬂows
has played an intricate role in our analysis, notably the proof of Lemma 4. It is worth men-
tioning [10] where they have treated the homogenization of convection-diﬀusion problem in
strong convection regime where the ﬂuid ﬁeld is given by an harmonic potential. In the
context of purely periodic ﬂuid ﬁelds, there are works that consider compressible ﬂows and
perform the homogenization of convection-diﬀusion problems in strong convection regime
(see [15, 5]). The approach is to employ a factorization principle to factor out oscillations
from the solution via principal eigenfunctions of an associated spectral problem and to
cancel any exponential decay in time of the solution using the principal eigenvalue of the
same spectral problem. This approach has not been attempted in the literature for locally
periodic coeﬃcients. The authors will address this issue in the near future.

8. Appendix

In this section, we give the proof of Lemma 1 on some basic facts on the ﬂows.

Proof of Lemma 1. We prove each claim in turn.

c (Rd; R) be an arbitrary test function and let the index i be arbitrary.

By the chain rule,

(ii) We compute

∇X ·(cid:16)eJ(τ, X)ef (τ, X)(cid:17) = ef (τ, X) ·(cid:16)∇X · ⊤eJ(τ, X)(cid:17) + eJ(τ, X) : ∇Xef (τ, X),

where : is the Frobenius inner product. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side vanishes
thanks to (i). For the second term, we use the ﬂow representation to obtain

∇X ·(cid:16)eJ(τ, X)ef (τ, X)(cid:17) = eJ(τ, X)J(−τ, X) : ∇xf (Φτ (X), y).

Thanks to the autonomy of the ﬂow, the left side of the Frobenius product is the
identity matrix. Therefore the above display vanishes as f is divergence free.

(iii) Performing an integration by parts, we have:

ZRd

φ(X)(cid:16)⊤eJ(τ, X)∇Xϕ(X)(cid:17) dX

φ(X)ϕ(X)(cid:16)∇X · ⊤eJ (τ, X)(cid:17) dX −ZRd

ϕ(X)(cid:16)⊤eJ(τ, X)∇Xφ(X)(cid:17) dX.

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of the previous expression vanishes, thanks to
(i). Hence, we have proved the result.

(iv) Consider the time derivatives for the i-th component:

As g(0) = 0, a Grönwall type argument yields g(τ ) = 0. Hence the result.
