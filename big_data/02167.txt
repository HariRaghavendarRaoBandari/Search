Abstract

In this text we review a few structural properties of matrix models that should at least partly generalize to
random tensor models. We review some aspects of the loop equations for matrix models and their algebraic
counterpart for tensor models. Despite the generic title of this review, we, in particular, invoke the Topological
Recursion. We explain its appearance in matrix models. Then we state that a family of tensor models provides
a natural example which satisﬁes a version of the most general form of the topological recursion, named the
blobbed topological recursion. We discuss the diﬃculties of extending the technical solutions existing for matrix
models to tensor models. Some proofs are not published yet but will be given in a coming paper, the rest of the
results are well known in the literature

Introduction

Since Razvan Gurau and collaborators have discovered colored random tensor models and their 1/N expansion
imitating the 1/N expansion of random matrix models, the ﬁeld of random tensor models has been growing
fastly.
Indeed the introduction of colors cured several problems which prevented the early tensor models intro-
duced in [ADJ91] to grow further as an approach to higher dimensional quantum gravity.
From a mathematical point of view, these colored tensor models are generating functions of a special class of piece-
wise linear (P L) manifolds in dimension d called GEM [FG82]. These P L-manifolds are counted with respect to
their degree (which, from a combinatorial standpoint, generalizes the genus) and their discrete volume.
The intense scientiﬁc activity of the ﬁeld leads to new questions for mathematical physicists, most of them being
rather challenging. A good amount of these new results and problems come from trying to extend what we know
about two dimensional tensor models (= matrix models) to higher dimensional models. There exists a lot of ex-
amples supporting such a claim. One thinks about the extension of the 1/N expansion (see for instance [Gur12a]),
the computation of ﬁrst and second order [BGRR11, KOR14], the extension of double scaling limits - for instance
in [DGR13, BGRT14] -, saddle point techniques [NDE15] and the study of Schwinger-Dyson equations by combi-
natorial means [BGR12, BGRT14]. Questions about the possible integrable properties arose recently [Dar14]. If
most tensor models are probably not integrable, it is likely that the rich structure of integrable matrix models are
generalized in the context of tensor models (a ﬁrst example is provided by [Dar14]).
Among all these results, one misses the extension of one of the most elegant and powerful discovery in matrix
models: the topological recursion. The topological recursion has been settled for the study of loop equations of
the Hermitian one matrix model [Eyn04]. It since has been linked to the algebraic geometry of surfaces [Ora07].
Then the topological recursion has been used to gain new insights in topological string theory, invariants of moduli
spaces, combinatorics, integrable systems and knot theory [EO08, Eyn15a, Eyn15b].

In this review paper we focus on this idea. In a ﬁrst part we recall how the topological recursion arises in the
study of the loop equations of a Hermitian one matrix model. We show how this is linked to the so-called Virasoro
constraints. In a second part, we describe the Schwinger-Dyson equations of a generic tensor model. We explain

why an extension of the formalism of the loop equations, if not excluded, is not obvious. Since we cannot make
progress in the generic case we show in a third and fourth part what can be done in a simpler case called the Quartic
Melonic Tensor Model. We indeed show that this particular model satisfy a version of the Blobbed Topological
Recursion in a speciﬁc series of dimensions d = 4k + 2. This induces that all the structures attached to the blobbed
version of the topological recursion can be found in this particular model. Nevertheless, there still are diﬃculties
left to treat to conclude that we solved this model. The conclusion is then devoted to the presentation of a program
whose aim is the discovery of Topological Recursion like structures in tensor models.

2 Loop equations for matrix models and how to solve them.

2.1 Loop equations

Matrix models obey a set of constraints that appear in the literature under many diﬀerent names [Eyn15b,DFGZJ95,
Eyn15a]. One names them Loop equations, Virasoro constraints, Schwinger-Dyson equations, Cut-and-Join equa-
tions, Tutte equations and so on... This is due to the fact that the structure of this set of equations appears not only
in matrix models but in a wide variety of domains of mathematics, physics and combinatorics [Eyn15b]. Although
this topics is fascinating, it is above all incredibly rich. As a consequence it is not possible to make a complete
presentation of the subject here and this for two reasons. The ﬁrst (and main) is that the author is not competent
enough. The second one is that it would fall way beyond the scope of this review paper. So, in this text we make
the choice of presenting only the small part of it that is the closest in spirit to what one would extend to tensor
models.

Loop equations1 are nothing more than the consequences of the invariance of a Lebesgue measure under trans-
lations. This particular feature turns out to be important since this implies that these equations are true even
non-perturbatively. However, when it comes to ﬁnding solutions (exact or not), one often restricts to perturbative
solutions.
These sets of equations are obtained as follows [AM90, EO08]. Consider, for instance, a Hermitian matrix model,
whose partition function writes

(1)

Z1MM [{tp}] =ZHN

dM exp (−N Tr V (M )) .

it is not obvious to state the needed conditions on the tp’s for the integral to converge. However, as long as one
understands this integral perturbatively, as an expansion around all tp6=2 = 0, t2 = 1/2, one can forget about these
conditions2. The integral presented above is invariant under change of variables. In particular, this is invariant under

From the choice of V (M ) depends the possible interpretations of this integral. Indeed for a generic V (x) =Pp≥1 tpxp
the change of variables M → M′ = M +ǫ(x−M )−1. The Jacobian J is, up to the ﬁrst order in ǫ, J ≃Pp,a,q,b δpaδqb+
ǫ∂Mpq (x − M )−1
ab . The exponential term is at ﬁrst order exp (−N Tr V (M )) (1 − N ǫ Tr(V ′(M )(x − M )−1)). Then
the invariance implies

(cid:10)Tr(x − M )−1 Tr(x − M )−1(cid:11) −(cid:28)Tr

N V ′(M )

(x − M )(cid:29) = 0.

This is the ﬁrst of a series of equations that are obtained by making the more general changes M′ = M + ǫ(x1 −
M )−1 Tr(x2 − M )−1 . . . Tr(xn − M )−1. Denoting

¯Wn(x1, . . . , xn) =(cid:10)Tr(x1 − M )−1 Tr(x2 − M )−1 . . . Tr(xn − M )−1(cid:11) .
Wn(x1, . . . , xn) =(cid:10)Tr(x1 − M )−1 Tr(x2 − M )−1 . . . Tr(xn − M )−1(cid:11)c .

Using these objects, equation (2) writes,

(5)

N V ′(M )

(x − M )(cid:29) = 0,

1from now on we use this name for the constraints satisﬁed by matrix models.
2but if these conditions are satisﬁed, the derivation presented here is still valid.

When considering perturbative solutions, one can expand the W ’s in term of N the size of the matrix3. The
prototypical type of expansion is

Wn(x1, . . . , xn) =Xh≥0

N 2−2g−nW g

One then gets a series of equations indexed by (g, n). For instance,

Bertrand Eynard, Nicolas Orantin and collaborators [Eyn04, Ora07] constructed a formula to compute the W ’s.
This is now understood as relying on the fact that the equation on W 0
1 deﬁnes an aﬃne plane curve [Ora07,Eyn15b].
In fact, if one considers W 0
1 and x as two complex indeterminates, the ﬁrst equation is (in the simplest case) a
polynomial in these two indeterminates in C2. This polynomial generically vanishes on a surface in C2. Up to
subtleties, the choice of variables and polynomial made to describe this surface correspond to a choice of complex
structure on it [Mir95]. Finding the expression W 0
1 (x) corresponds to writing a description of this surface as a
sheeted surface.

2.2 Topological Recursion in the 1-cut case

In the next part we restrict to the so called 1-cut case4. So to say x lives in the complex plane and W 0
1 (x) has one cut
somewhere in this complex plane so that it is naturally deﬁned on two copies of the complex plane [Eyn04,Eyn15b].
The corresponding surface is the Riemann surface of W 0
1 and is the sphere. Using uniformizing coordinates, it is
possible to write W 0
1 as a function on the sphere seen as C ∪ {∞}. These coordinates are known in physics under
the name of Joukowsky coordinates. They write

a − b(cid:18)x −

a + b

2

+p(x − a)(x − b)(cid:19) ,

where a, b are the endpoints of the cut. A choice of determination for the square root is a choice of sheet for x where
to live, and so is a choice of one of the two standard charts for the sphere C ∪ {∞}. Through this transformation,
the cut is mapped to the unit circle with a and b being sent to −1 and +1 and the transition from one chart to the
other is given by the transition map ι(z) = 1/z.
In order to study properly the analytic properties of the solutions one needs [Sch07, EO08] to deﬁne the forms

(13)

n(z1, . . . , zn) := W g

n (x1(z1), . . . , xn(zn))dx1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ dxn.

by pull-backing the W ’s by the function x(z) and turning these pull-backs into sections of tensor products5 of the
canonical bundle. The equations on the W ’s directly translate into equations on the ω’s. In these coordinates,
these equations are equivalent to a set of linear equations and quadratic equations. The ﬁrst are called linear loop
equations [Eyn04, BEO15] and state for 2g − 2 + n > 0 that
(14)

n(z1, . . . , zn) := ωg

n(z1, . . . , zn) + ωg

n(ι(z1), . . . , zn) = 0.

3this is not always possible for convergent matrix integrals that can contain term of the form e−A/N 2
4We also make an “under the carpet” assumption: the potential is polynomial.
5We again put some symmetry assumptions under the carpet, it is not just a tensor product [Eyn15b].

1. K(z, z1) is a kernel that is not symmetric in its
variables. This kernel is constructed out of ω0
2 [Eyn15a]. These forms are initial conditions for the recursion.
One consequently has to determine the Riemann surface (with its complex structure) described by the polynomial
in (W 0
2(z1, z2) and that is computed from the loop equations. This
bi-diﬀerential has the property of having a double pole at z1 = z2. This why in some sense it allows to write a
Cauchy formula [Eyn15a] that leads after some work to equation (16). This formula is at the core of the formalism

Let us now come back to the W ’s, that up to some change of variables, we are now able to compute. As we

deﬁned them they write as some correlators of a matrix model,

(18)

Wn(x1, . . . , xn) =(cid:10)Tr(x1 − M )−1 Tr(x2 − M )−1 . . . Tr(xn − M )−1(cid:11)c .

Then in the perturbative setting, the coeﬃcient of x−p1−1
is actually counting the number of
maps with n marked boundary of length p1, p2, . . . , pn. More geometrically, it counts the number of P L cobordisms
between a collection of n P L S1. The W ’s are then generating functions for these numbers. Constructing these
generating functions of observables of the matrix models is easily possible because the observables are indexed by
a collection of integers (the length of the P L S1).

2.3 Virasoro constraints in matrix models

The ﬁrst equation (2) actually contains the constraints often called Virasoro constraints. Indeed, if we perform the
expansion at x1 = ∞ as above we obtain

where ˆW (x) is the operator (formally) deﬁned as

Since the Lp’s form a Virasoro algebra, the loop equations are also often called Virasoro constraints. The operator
ˆW can be extended to the whole Riemann sphere using the z coordinates.

3 Constraint equations for tensor models

3.1 Schwinger-Dyson equations of tensor models

In this subsection we consider a generic tensor model of the form

(24)

Z[N,{tB}] =Z dT d ¯T exp(cid:16)−N d−1XB

N− 2

(d−2)! ω(B)
|Aut(B)|

tBB(T, ¯T )(cid:17)

where the tB’s are coupling constants associated to the tensor invariant indexed by the (d − 1) colored graphs
B [BGR12]. One can introduce the formal generating series of observables
(25)

G[{qB•}] =XB•

qB• B•(T, ¯T ).

B• is a graph with a marked white vertex, this means that it represents a linear form over the vector space of the
¯T ’s. When evaluated at ¯T this form gives the corresponding invariant B. We now make the change of variables
T → T ′ = T + ǫG[{qB•}], inducing the change of variables ¯T → ¯T ′ = ¯T + ¯ǫG[{qB•}]. Computing the Jacobian of
the transformation at ﬁrst order in ǫ we obtain that it writes

(26)

|J| = 1 + ǫ TrT⊕ ¯T XB•

qB• ∂Ta1 ...ad

B•(T, ¯T )a1...ad ⊕ e−2iθc.c.! + O(ǫ2)).

We used in particular ǫ = |ǫ|eiθ. As explained in [Gur12b, Dar15] the derivatives terms appearing in the trace can
all be represented graphically. After taking the trace, they become invariants obtained by contracting the lines
between the marked vertex and the vertex representing the T (resp. ¯T ) the derivative operator acted on. This
change of variables also induces a change in the potential of the integrand, that writes, up to ﬁrst order in epsilon,

(27)

V (T, ¯T ) + ǫ Xa1...ad

∂Ta1 ...ad

V (T, ¯T )X qB• B•(T, ¯T )a1...ad + c.c..

Each term proportional to qB• represents an invariant obtained by contracting the marked vertex of B• and the
vertex of a B(T, ¯T ) in the potential V (T, ¯T ) acted on with the derivative operator. This leads to a full series of
terms denoted B ⋆v B• proportional to qB• . This can be expressed using diﬀerential operators [Gur12b] of the tB,
LB• associated7 to each qB• . We have from the fact that the integral does not change under change of variables
that,

(28)

ˆG[{qB•}]Z[N,{tB}] := XB•

qB• LB•! Z[N,{tB}] = 0.

This is very similar to what is obtained in the context of matrix models. However we cannot keep track of the
full structure of the observable B with a single power of a complex variable anymore. That is the main obstacle
to an extension of the Topological Recursion to general tensor models. Certainly one can try to forget about
some structure of the observables to keep only what can be encoded with one single integer. For instance one

7In the sketch of derivation presented here one ends with LB• that are direct sums of the diﬀerential operators presented in [Gur12b].

can think of the volume of the observable (its number of vertices), or the length of one of the face going through
the marked vertex. In the three dimensional case, the last choice would provide generating functions of proper
normal embedding of a surface in a three dimensional P L-manifold; while the ﬁrst leads to generating functions
of P L-manifolds with respect to the volume of their boundaries. Doing so a lot of qB• collapse to the same value,
and we can, a priori, obtain functions deﬁned on the complex numbers. Unfortunately it is not obvious to get the
corresponding properties of these generating functions even in these simpliﬁed cases.

So in order to investigate the structure of tensor models and their Schwinger-Dyson equations a bit more while
slowly moving towards a generalization of the Topological Recursion to higher dimensional cases, we review, in the
next section, a simpler model.

4 The Quartic Melonic model

4.1

Introduction of the model and Loop equations

We consider the (almost) simplest interacting tensor model in dimension d. Its potential contains a quadratic term
and all the quartic melonic interaction terms, symmetrically weighted. In this review it is named Quartic Melonic
Tensor Model (QMTM). Its partition function writes [Gur14, NDE15],

After resummation of the ﬁrst order and thanks to a Hubbard-Stratanovitch transformation, it is possible to rewrite
the partition function, up to a proportionality factor as [NDE15, Dar15],

log2 means that we consider the formal series in α associated to the log and that we forget the ﬁrst term of this
series. α is the resummed coupling constant whose value can be expressed from λ [NDE15]. This resummed model,
is a multi-matrix model that satisﬁes loop equations. These equations can be derived in a similar fashion than in
section 2. However one should point out a ﬁrst problem in this tentative to generalize the topological recursion.
The potential here contains non-trivial N terms spoiling the topological expansion of observables of these models8.
Fortunately, in a series of dimensions d = 4k + 2, k ∈ N [Dar15], these N terms do not destroy the topological
expansion as long as we consider that the interaction terms now represent cells with non trivial topology (i.e. not
just discs as in usual matrix models, but any surface with at least one boundary). This idea has been investigated
in a work of [Bor13] in the context of generalized Hermitian one matrix model. Coming back to the loop equations,
if we focus for instance on the d = 6 dimensional case, even though they are more complicated and need the
introduction of some multi-dimensional integral terms, it is still possible to write them. These additional multi-
dimensional integral terms are due to the fact that the potential writes in term of tensor products of the Mc and
not in term of the Mc alone. These loop equations write

4.2 Spectral curve and Givental decomposition

These loop equations also encode the geometry of an aﬃne plane curve. However in this case the described surface
is not a sphere but rather a collection of discs with two marked points on each of them. In fact, in [Dar14], it has
been shown that the tensor model can be described in a Givental fashion, using the action of a diﬀerential operator
ˆO on a product of Hermitian one matrix models

(34)

Z[N, λ] = exp( ˆO)

d

Yi=1

Z1MM [{tp}].

This result, if derived only for Z in [Dar14], also extends to the case of Z. Moreover the resulting model is Gaussian
at leading order, so that the resulting spectral curve is made of a union of Gaussian spectral curves, turning it into
a disconnected spectral curve whose connected components are the spectral curves of Gaussian models. Here, it is a
union of discs with two marked points. The generalized Givental decomposition thus amount to describe the model
in terms of quantities that are deﬁned on each connected component of the spectral curve, but not necessarily on
the full spectral curve. Each connected component is indeed described by the equation for the leading order 1-point
resolvent of the matrix of a given color i. Taking into account all the colors leads to the full disconnected spectral
curve. However, one points out that if disconnected, the components are not independent one from another. As we
indeed noticed sooner the choice of W 0
1 for each color corresponds to a choice of complex structure for the spectral
curve, but in the tensor model case, the equation for W 0
ei involves constant terms that are ﬁxed by the choices made
for the W 0

ej for j 6= i:

ζjW 0

ej (ζj ) + (1 − α2) = 0.

Combinatorial arguments on the Feynman graphs of the model lead to impose that the integral term is zero in
this case. However, this argument comes from the fact that we consider the model as a formal integral, and could
be false in general. If these terms do not change the topology of the curve, they potentially change the complex
structure, for instance the position of the marked points can be changed. In the end the spectral curve associated
to the model in dimension d = 4k + 2 for k ∈ N∗ is described by the following data
Proposition 1. The spectral curve of the resummed quartic melonic tensor model is given by S = (Σ, ω0
where

5 A Blobbed Topological Recursion for The QMTM

One shows that the ωg
k of the d = 4k + 2 dimensional QMTM satisfy a version of the topological recursion that is
closely related to the one introduced by Gaetan Borot and Sergei Shadrin in [BS15]. These are results that are not
published yet, even though they are proved and will be published in [BD]. From any ωg
k we deﬁne two objects by
the following relations

In order to give a recursive formula for the whole ωg

k one needs to introduce possibly unknown quantities, called
initial conditions. They are diﬀerential forms denoted φg
k, whose indices have the same role than the indices of
ωg
k. If one is able to provide an expression for these quantities one is, at least in principle, able to give an explicit
expression for all ωg
k. The analogue quantities introduced in [BS15] can, in principle, be computed in the case of
the multi-trace Hermitian one matrix model described by [Bor13]. In our case an eﬃcient representation is still
missing, the diﬃculty really comes from the fact that there are several connected components in the spectral curve.
However we present a formula that applies to our situation, assuming the φg

k are eﬃciently generated.

If one deﬁnes [BD]

Deﬁnition 1. A normalized solution of loop equations ωg,0

We can give a graphical description of the solution in terms of the normalized forms and the φg

k. First consider

the set of labelled graphs.

Deﬁnition 2. We deﬁne Gg

k(A, B) the set of graphs satisfying the following properties:

8

• Vertices: Graphs Γ ∈ Gg

k(A, B) are made of vertices v that are of two types, either ω0 or φ. They carry an
integer label h(v) called its genus such that the valency d(v) of v satisﬁes 2h(v) − 2 + d(v) > 0. Furthermore,
vertices of type ω0 are labeled by an integer c ∈ [[1, d]] called its color while each φ vertex v is labeled by a
multiplet q ∈ Nd, its colors, such that the valency of v is d(v) = |q(v)|. Finally the component qi of q encodes
the number of half edges of color i incident to the vertex (i.e. monocolored edges of color i or bicolored edges
of color (j, i) such that the i end is attached to the vertex).

• Edges are of two types:

connect ω0 vertices to φ vertices.

1. Monocolored edges: They are labeled by one integer i ∈ [[1, d]] called its color. Monocolored edges can only
2. Bicolored edges: They are labeled by two integers (i, j) ∈ [[1, d]]2, i 6= j also called colors. These labels are
to be seen as attached to the end of the edge. Bicolored edges of color (i, j) can only connect ω0 vertices
of color i to ω0 vertices of color j.

• Leaves (unbounded edges): There are |k| unbounded edges/leaves. Denote L the set of leaves. It can be written
L =Fd
i=1 Li with Li = [[1, ki]] being the set of leaves of color i. Moreover Li splits into the set of leaves with
label a and the one with label b i.e. Li = Ai ⊔ Bi. Then,
1. Each leaf of color i with label a can be of two types:

a. Either a monocolored leaf. In this case, it is incident to a φq vertex with qi ≥ 1.
b. Or a bicolored leaf. In this case, it is incident to a ω0 vertex of color l such that the bicolored leaf has

bicoloration (l, i) and the l end is attached to the ω0 vertex while the i end is left free.

2. Each leaf of color i with label b is incident to a ω0 vertex of color i

• ω0 vertex have at least a leaf. Moreover each ω0 vertex must have at least one monocolored leaf.
• Γ is connected and b1(Γ) +Pv h(v) = g.

To each of these graphs is attached a weight in such a way that we can compute

Theorem 1. Given A = (A1, A2, . . . , Ad) and B = (B1, B2, . . . , Bd) two multiplets of subsets of the sets [[1, ki]]
such that Ai ⊔ Bi = [[1, ki]], we have:

where ̟(zk) is a weight associated to the graph Γ.

The weight ̟(zk) is computed in the following way. Set Γ a graph in Gg

k(A, B). The weight of Γ is made out
of a product of local weight to which we apply a certain pairing. Each vertex represent a certain local weight. This
weight is of type ωh(v),0
e}) for a vertex v of color i of type ω0 with valency d(v). On the other hand this local
d(v)ei
weight is given by φg
q(v) for a vertex of type φ while q(v) is determined by the colors of the half edges incident to
it. Now split the set of edges of Γ into the set of colored edges and the one of bicolored edges. The same shall be
done for the set of leaves.

k for any (k, g) assuming that one knows about the normalized ωg′,0
From Theorem 1, it is possible to compute iHωg
for any (g′, n′) and the φg′
k′ satisfying respectively 2g′ − 2 + n′ < 2g − 2 + |k| and 2g′ − 2 + |k′| < 2g − 2 + |k|. This
is indeed the case for the normalized forms that are recursively computed from a topological recursion which just
2ei. But this is not true in general that we can generate the φg′
needs as an input ω0
k′. In some sense the idea
we described can be seen as either a generalization or a specialization (depending on your tastes) of the formalism
introduced in [Bor13]. In the formalism introduced in [Bor13], the initial conditions are named this way because
this is something one has to add as an input to the Blobbed Topological Recursion to obtain the solutions of the
mathematical problem one wants to solve. But depending on this speciﬁc problem, it can or cannot be possible to
write these initial conditions in a closed way. The current question is, is it possible to do so in the context of the
QMTM?

ei , ω0

n′ei

As we saw in this part the generalization of the topological recursion ideas to the simplest tensor models already
involves using/generalizing state of the art techniques for the topological recursion. In spite of these eﬀorts, the
colored version of the W ’s computed here are generating functions for a very restricted set of observables of the
original tensor models (melonic cyclic graphs). It is not known at the moment how to obtain a more general set
of observables. Moreover, works need to be done in dimension d 6= 4k + 2. Of course, it is possible to force the
ωg
k to depend on N . This would circumvent the problem of the non-topological nature of the 1/N expansion at
the level of the analytical properties of the ωg
k. This solution has the major disadvantages of spoiling the ordering
provided by the 1/N expansion and being conceptually not satisfactory. The question is whether or not there exists
a more natural setting that would extend the topological recursion idea and naturally contain the non-topological
case (maybe simplifying when the topological situation is recovered)?

6 Why is it diﬃcult to compute the φg

k?

In the 1-cut case for multi-trace Hermitian matrix model, one takes advantage of the fact that the corresponding
linear loop equations for 2g − 2 + n > 0 writes
(47)

(S + O)ωg

n (z1; z2, . . . , zn),

n = dz1V g

where V g
expression is known and only depends on ωg′
out of W 0

n (z1; z2, . . . , zn) is a holomorphic function of z1 around the marked points of the spectral curve whose
n′ with 2g′ − 2 + n′ < 2g − 2 + n and O is a linear operator constructed

1 and the planar 2-point potential. Moreover the corresponding bi-diﬀerential satisﬁes

(48)

(S + O)ω0

2 =

dx1 ⊗ dx2

(x(z1) − x(z2))2 .

From this very fact we have that (S + O)P ωn
n (z1; z2, . . . , zn). It is possible
to construct a second, simple, expression for Hωg
2. Then by acting
with the H operator on all remaining variables z2, . . . , zn of this expression, one gets, a quite involved, expression
for the φg
n that only depends on objects with greater Euler characteristic, so that they can in principles be computed
at any order [Bor13, BS15].

g = 0 which implies (S + O)Hωg

n by just convoluting V g

n (z1; z2, . . . , zn) with ω0

n = dz1 V g

In the case of tensor models, the situation changes a bit, and prevents this technique to be applied eﬃciently.

Indeed, the linear loop equations have in general the form

This linear loop equation also involves the action of an operator that looks like the O of the one matrix case, but,
this operator is now acting on a linear combination10 of ωg
that depends on k. If in some cases, it is possible to
ki
compute the term OP ki
ciωg
k this new expression add new terms in the equation that depends
ki
on the Taylor expansion of the ωg′
k′ with 2g′ − 2 + |k′| < 2g − 2 + |k|. Moreover obtaining this new expression
involves coming back to the original loop equations and study their expansion at x0 = ∞. From this expansion we
can extract the data we need to compute OP ki
k and a

change of the function V g
k . The problem of this method is that it is not very eﬃcient, and the relative computability
of the low order cases relies heavily on the fact that we focused on the symmetric QMTM (i.e. all coupling constant
of the interactions terms are the same).

What does it means for the model? The current state of the art is that the model in dimensions d = 4k + 2
indeed satisﬁes a version of the blobbed topological recursion. However it is only an abstract tool as it is not yet
possible to construct the solution eﬃciently just from the graphical expansion given by this version of the blobbed
topological recursion. If one forgets about the eﬃciency (as compared to the blobbed topological recursion of the
1-cut multi-trace Hermitian one matrix model11), one can obtain, in principle the expression of the φg
k as their
calculation always involves objects that are already known from lower order computations. However, there is no
automatic method to describe them yet. In general, one needs to invert an aﬃne operator at each order, and the
size of this operator grows with the order of the φ one wants to compute.

However, the good news is that this colored version of the blobbed topological recursion can be understood as
the blobbed topological recursion applied to the case of a multi-cut disconnected spectral curve naturally generated
by the tensor model case. Firstly, it is the ﬁrst example of a natural model generating such a curve. Secondly, it
implies that all the structural properties of the blobbed topological recursion are satisﬁed. In particular, it implies
that the subset of cyclic melonic observables are related to combination of intersection numbers, so that the QMTM
decomposes on Kontsevitch matrix integrals [Kon92], which is a second form of generalized Givental decomposition.
These results allow tensor models to make connection with one of the most active part of mathematical physics
nowadays.

7 Conclusion

In this review we explained recent ideas that need to be developed in the context of tensor models. The Virasoro
constraints in some matrix models allow one to reformulate the computation of some (generating functions of)
observables of matrix models in terms of computations of correlation functions of conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT).
Can we extend this idea using the Lie algebra of constraints of tensor models? Is there an analogue of CFT that
carries this constraint algebra of tensor models as its algebra of symmetry? Is it linked to W algebras?

Matrix models associate to each piecewise linear collection of S1 an amplitude that is computed from combina-
torial weights associated to each P L cobordisms between these S1. From this point of view they are an incarnation
of two dimensional Topological Field Theory.
Tensor models do the same but with more dimensions. For instance in the d = 3 dimensional case, they associate
to each collection of P L surfaces an amplitude that is computed from combinatorial weight associated to each P L
cobordisms between them. But, from the liberty we have in choosing the qB• , we can now also distinguish and
weight the sub-manifolds of these surfaces. This let us think (without rigorous arguments) that three dimensional
tensor models have the ﬂavor of a categoriﬁcation of matrix models, indeed the one dimensional sub-manifolds of the
observables can be seen at the objects, the observables as the morphisms and the cobordims between observables as
the 2-morphisms. If one wants to generalize the idea of topological recursion to higher dimensional models such as
tensor models, it would certainly be interesting to understand the Topological Recursion in the categorical language
and then try to categorify it, while using tensor models as a guiding example for this categoriﬁcation.

A more approachable series of problems is probably to extend the techniques developed in the case of the
QMTM, and this independently of the possibility to ﬁnd an eﬃcient representation of the φg
k or not. First of all,
one should try to reformulate these results using the tensor variables. It could also be interesting to focus on the

11which is already very involve when compares to the usual topological recursion applied to the 1-cut Hermitian one matrix model.

11

cases of larger family of melonic interactions. One could also try to ﬁnd a speciﬁcation of the qB• that leads to
interesting properties for the thus deﬁned generating functions.

From the purely topological recursion point of view, results concerning the fate of integrable structures in
the blobbed framework would be interesting.
If they certainly do not survive as they are, it may well be pos-
sible that they are deformed or generalized in some way. Such results could shed some light on the ’integrabil-
ity/computability/solvability’ properties of the QMTM (while being interesting on its own).

The topological recursion has only recently been generalized to a class of tensor models [BD]. This starts a new
program whose goal is the study of topological recursion within the framework of tensor models. This program
could help us further understand the mathematics underlying tensor models, while maybe revealing limits to the
application of the topological recursion. If it is probably a very diﬃcult program, it is possible to make small steps.
One shall start by focusing on simple models, and by getting inspiration from what have been done in the context
of matrix models and the topological recursion, for which there already is a rich mathematical apparatus, ranging
from very practical mathematical tools (that are well suited to computations) from very abstract ideas (that are
more suited to understanding the generalized structures).
