Restrictions of free arrangements and the

division theorem

Takuro Abe∗

March 15, 2016

Abstract

This is a survey and research note on the modiﬁed Orlik conjecture
derived from the division theorem introduced in [2]. The division
theorem is a generalization of classical addition-deletion theorems for
free arrangements. The division theorem can be regarded as a modiﬁed
converse of the Orlik’s conjecture with a combinatorial condition, i.e.,
an arrangement is free if the restriction is free and the characteristic
polynomial of the restriction divides that of an arrangement. In this
article we recall, summarize, pose and re-formulate some of results
and problems related to the division theorem based on [2], and study
the modiﬁed Orlik’s conjecture with partial answers.

Introduction

Let K be an arbitrary ﬁeld, V = Kℓ and S = K[x1, . . . , xℓ] the coordinate ring
of V ∗. Let A be an arrangement of hyperplanes in V , i.e., a ﬁnite collection
of linear hyperplanes in V . For H ∈ A ﬁx a linear form αH ∈ V ∗ such that
ker(αH ) = H. For Der S := ⊕ℓ
i=1S∂xi, a logarithmic derivation module D(A)
of A is deﬁned by

D(A) := {θ ∈ Der S | θ(αH ) ∈ SαH (∀H ∈ A)}.

D(A) is a reﬂexive S-module, and not free in general. We say A is free with
exponents exp(A) = (d1, . . . , dℓ) if there is derivations θ1, . . . , θℓ ∈ D(A) such
that D(A) = ⊕ℓ
i=1Sθi and deg θi(βi) = di (i = 1, . . . , ℓ) for some linear form
β1, . . . , βℓ such that θi(βi) 6= 0.

Let L(A) := {∩H∈BH | B ⊂ A} be the intersection lattice of A, and

Li(A) := {X ∈ L(A) | codimV X = i}. A ﬂag of A is a set {Xi}ℓ
i=0
such that X0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xℓ and Xi ∈ Li(A). The M¨obius function µ :
L(A) → Z is deﬁned by, µ(V ) = 1 and by µ(X) := − PX(Y ⊂V µ(Y ) for
X 6= V . The Poincar`e polynomial π(A; t) of A is deﬁned by π(A; t) :=
PX∈L(A) µ(X)(−t)codimV X . Also, the characteristic polynomial χ(A; t) of A
is deﬁned by χ(A; t) := tℓπ(A; −t−1). It is known that π(A; t) coincides with
the topological Poincar`e polynomial of the complement M(A) := V \∪H∈AH
when K = C. Hence the coeﬃcient bi(A) of ti in π(A; t) is nothing but the
i-th Betti number of M(A). For X ∈ L(A), a localization AX of A at X is
deﬁned by AX := {H ∈ A | X ⊂ H}, and the restriction AX of A onto X is
deﬁned by AX := {H ∩ X | H ∈ A \ AX}. Note that AX is an arrangement
in V , but AX is that in X ≃ Kdim X .

Free arrangements have been intensively studied by several mathemati-
cians, and that research has been the most important among the study of
algebraic aspects of an arrangement. To check the freeness of given arrange-
ment, or to construct a new free arrangement is very diﬃcult though that is
very fundamental. For that purpose, Terao’s addition-deletion and restric-
tion theorems have been the most useful and important.

Theorem 1.1 ([9], Addition-deletion and restriction theorems)
For H ∈ A, let A′ := A \ {H}. Then for the triple (A, A′, AH), two of the
following three implies the third:

(1) A is free with exp(A) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ).

(2) A′ is free with exp(A′) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ − 1).

(3) AH is free with exp(AH) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1).

Moreover, all the three above hold if both A and A′ are free.

In [2] the division theorem for free arrangements was introduced, which

is a generalization of Terao’s addition-deletion theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.2 (Theorem 1.1, [2], Division theorem)
A is free if AH is free and χ(AH; t) divides χ(A; t) for some H ∈ A.

Theorem 1.2 can be regarded as a converse of modiﬁed Orlik’s conjecture.
Orlik’s conjecture asserted that AH is free if A is free, the counter example to
which was found by Edelman and Reiner in [6]. Theorem 1.2 is a converse of
this conjecture with one more condition that χ(AH; t) divides χ(A; t). Then
it is natural to ask whether this modiﬁed Orlik’s conjecture is true or not.

Problem 1.3 (Modiﬁed Orlik’s Conjecture)
Let A be an ℓ-arragement and H ∈ A. Assume that A is free and π(AH; t)
divides π(A; t). (Equivalently, π(A \ {H}; t) divides π(A; t).) Then is AH
(and hence A \ {H}) a free arrangement?

It seems that what is stated in Problem 1.3 is too strong, hence we believe
In other words, we

that there will be a counter example to Problem 1.3.
believe the following conjecture.

Conjecture 1.4
There exists an arrangement A and H ∈ A such that, for the triple (A, A′, AH),
it holds that
(1) π(AH; t) = Qℓ−1
(2) π(AH; t) divides both π(A; t) and π(A′; t), and

i=1(1 + dit) with d1, . . . , dℓ−1 ∈ Z,

(3) Neither A nor A′ are free (or, A is free and A′ is not free).

By Theorem 1.2, there are no triples as in Conjecture 1.4 if the condition
(3) in Conjecture 1.4 holds. Also, there are no such triple when ℓ ≤ 3 due
to [1]. Hence to show Conjecture 1.4, the assumption ℓ ≥ 4 is essential.
However, and surprisingly, there have been no example as in Conjecture 1.4.
The purpose of this article is to consider in which condition Problem 1.3
is true. The key role is played by the second Betti number b2(A) of the
complement of A when K = C. Namely, b2(A) is the coeﬃcient of tℓ−2 of
χ(A; t). One of the answer is the following, which is a main result in this
article.

Theorem 1.5
Assume that A is free and b2(A) = b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|. Then AH is
free if there is L ∈ A \ {H} such that A \ {L} is free and |AL∩H| ≥ 3.

Note that the equation b2(A) = b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH| holds when
χ(AH; t) divides χ(A; t). What is interesting in Theorem 1.5 is, to determine
the freeness of the restriction, a freeness of some other restriction works.

The other main result in this article is to give an easy suﬃcient condition
for A′ not to be free even when A is free. This gives us an easy suﬃcient
condition for the equation on the second Betti numbers above not to be true.

Theorem 1.6
Assume that A is a free ℓ-arrangement with ℓ ≥ 3. Let H ∈ A and A′ :=
A \ {H}. Then A′ is not free if there is X ∈ L2(AH) such that one of the
following three holds:

3

(1) AH

X = {K1, K2} and mH(K1) > 1, mH(K2) > 1.

(2) AH

X = {K1, K2, K3} and mH(Ki) ≥ 2 for i = 1, 2, 3.

(3) AH

X = {K1, K2, K3} and mH(K1) ≥ 3, mH(K2) ≥ 2.

Here mH : AH → Z>0 is the Ziegler multiplicity on AH deﬁned by

mH(K) := |{L ∈ A′ | H ∩ L = K}|

for K ∈ AH. In particular, if one of the three above holds, then it holds that
b2(A) > b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|.

Hence the arrangement A in Problem 1.3 has a very special geometry.

Let us show an application of Theorem 1.6.

Example 1.7
Let A be an arrangement in V = R4 deﬁned by

4

Y

i=1

xi

Y

(xi − xj) = 0.

1≤i<j≤4, (i,j)6=(3,4)

Then it is easy to see that A is free with exp(A) = (1, 2, 3, 3). Let H :=
{x1 = 0} ∈ A, and show that A \ {H} is not free. The Ziegler restriction
(AH, mH) of A onto H is deﬁned by

4

(

Y

i=2

x2
i )(x2 − x3)(x2 − x4) = 0.

Let X := {x3 = x4 = 0} ∈ L2(AH). Then AH
4 = 0}, which satisﬁes
the condition (1) in Theorem 1.6. Hence b2(A) > b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|
and A \ {H} is not free.

X = {x2

The organization of this article is as follows. In §2 we recall several results
and deﬁnitions for the proof. This section contains some re-formulation of
results in [2]. In §3, ﬁrst we give some partial answers to Problem 1.3 which
follows immediately from the division theorem and other results in [2]. After
that, we show Theorems 1.5 and 1.6.
In §4 we observe the similarity of
supersolvable and divisionally free arrangements.

2 Preliminaries

In this section let us recall several results we will use for the proof of main
results. The ﬁrst one is the most important result among the theory of free
arrangements.

Theorem 2.1 ([10], Terao’s factorization)
Assume that A is free with exp(A) = (d1. . . . , dℓ). Then χ(A; t) = Qℓ
di). In particular, A is not free if χ(A; t) is irreducible over Z.

i=1(t −

Next let us recall some fundamental deﬁnitions and results for multiar-
rangements. For an arrangement A, let m : A → Z≥0 be a multiplicity
function. Then the pair (A, m) is called a multiarrangement, and we can
deﬁne the logarithmic derivation module D(A, m) by

D(A, m) := {θ ∈ Der S | θ(αH) ∈ Sαm(H)

H

(∀H ∈ A)}.

Then we can deﬁne the freeness and exponents for multiarrangements in the
same manner as for arrangements.

From an arrangement, we may deﬁne a multiarrangement canonically. For
an arrangement A and H ∈ A, deﬁne a multiarrangement (AH, mH), called
the Ziegler restriction of A onto H, by mH (X) := |AX| − 1 for X ∈ AH.
Then the following is the most fundamental.

Theorem 2.2 ([14])
Assume that A is free with exp(A) = (1, d2, . . . , dℓ). Then (AH, mH ) is free
with exp(AH, mH ) = (d2, . . . , dℓ).

The next result is a generalization of Theorem 1.1 to multiarrangements.

For details and deﬁnitions on the Euler restriction, see [4].

Theorem 2.3 ([4], Theorem 0.8)
Let (A, m) be a multiarrangment, H ∈ A and let δH : A → {0, 1} be a
multiplicity such that δH (L) = 1 only when H = L. Then any two of the
following imply the third:

(1) (A, m) is free with exp(A, m) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ).

(2) (A, m − δH) is free with exp(A, m − δH) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ − 1).

(3) (AH, m∗) is free with exp(AH, m∗) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1),

where (AH, m∗) is the Euler restriction of (A, m) onto H ∈ A. Moreover, all
the three above hold if both (A, m) and (A, m − δH) are free.

5

The following is a freeness criterion by using the second Betti number
and the Ziegler restriction. For details, see [5]. Also, for the deﬁniton of the
second Betti number of a multiarrangement, see [3].

Theorem 2.4 ([5], Theorem 5.1)
Let A be a central ℓ-arrangement, H ∈ A and (AH, mH) the Ziegler re-
striction of A onto H. Then A is free if and only if (AH, mH) is free and
b2(A) = |A| − 1 + b2(AH, mH). In particular, b2(A) ≥ |A| − 1 + b2(AH, mH).

Let us introduce two more results from [2]. Since the formulations of
these results are slight diﬀerent from those in the original version in [2], we
give proofs for the completeness.

The ﬁrst one is the following proposition, which says that the Ziegler and

Euler restriction commutes if there is a division χ(AH; t) | χ(A; t).

Proposition 2.5 ([2], cf. Theorem 1.7)
Let A be an ℓ-arrangement, H ∈ A and (AH, mH) be the Ziegler restriction
of A onto H. Let X ∈ AH with mH (X) ≥ 2. Assume that b2(A) = b2(AH) +
(|A| − |AH|)|AH|. Then

(1) the Ziegler restriction of AH onto X coincides with the Euler restriction

of (AH, mH) onto X, and

(2) b2(AH, mH) − b2(AH, mH − δX) = |AH| − 1.

Proof. Immediate from Theorem 1.7 and its proof in [2].

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.6 ((b1, b2)-inequality, cf., [2], Corollary 4.10 )
Let H ∈ A. Then

In particular,

b2(A) ≥ b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|.

b2(A) ≥

ℓ−2

X

i=0

(|AXi| − |AXi+1|)|AXi+1|

for any ﬂag {Xi}ℓ−1

i=0 of A.

Proof. Let b2(dA) denote the coeﬃcient of t2 in π(A; t)/(1 + t). Then the
equation (4.1) in [2] shows that

b2(dA) ≥ b2(dAH) + (|A| − |AH|)(|AH| − 1).

6

Since b2(dA) + |A| − 1 = b2(A) and |A| − 1 = (|A| − |AH|) + (|AH| − 1),
we have b2(A) ≥ b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|. The next inequality holds by
applying the same argument to the Corollary 4.10 in [2].
(cid:3)

Here we give an observation. As in Theorem 1.1, the freeness of A and
A′ implies the freeness of each member of the triple. Here we do not have to
consider the freeness of AH. Then, when each member of the triple is free if
we assume the freeness of AH? The answer is immediate from Theorem 1.2.

Proposition 2.7
Let A be an arrangement and (A, A′, AH) the triple with respect to H ∈ A.
Then each member of the triple is free if and only if AH is free and b2(A) =
b2(AH) + (|A| − |AH|)|AH|.

Proof. The “only if” part is nothing but Theorem 1.1. The “if” part follows
also immediately by Theorem 1.2.
(cid:3)

3 A partial results and the proof of main re-

sults

Before the proof of Theorem 1.5, let us give some partial answer which follows
immediately from the division theorem and (b1, b2)-inequality.

Theorem 3.1
Let A be a free arrangement with exp(A) = (d1, . . . , dℓ). Take H ∈ A and
X ∈ AH such that

(1) AX is free with exp(AX) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−2), and

(2) |A| − |AH| = dℓ, (hence automatically, |AH| − |AX| = dℓ−1).

Then AH is also free with exp(AH) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1).
Proof. By Theorem 1.2, it suﬃces to show that b2(AH) = P1≤i<j≤ℓ−1 didj.
By Proposition 2.6, it holds that

b2(A) = X

didj ≥ b2(AH) + dℓ(d1 + · · · + dℓ−1), and

1≤i<j≤ℓ

b2(AH) ≥ b2(AX) + dℓ−1(d1 + · · · + dℓ−2) = X

didj + dℓ−1(d1 + · · · + dℓ−2).

1≤i<j≤ℓ−2

Hence

X

didj ≤ b2(AH) ≤ X

didj.

1≤i<j≤ℓ−1

1≤i<j≤ℓ−1

7

Hence b2(AH) = b2(AX) + (|AH| − |AX|)|AX|, and Theorem 1.2 completes
the proof.
(cid:3)

In Theorem 3.1, we apply the proof of Theorem 1.2 conversely. Hence
Theorem 3.1 may be regarded as an application of the proof of Theorem
1.2 and Proposition 2.6. A useful part of Theorem 3.1 is, if we know the
exponents of A and AX, then we can check the freeness between them just by
computing the number of hyperplanes in it (we do not need any information
on the second Betti number!). Hence practically, or when we want to check
some hereditary freeness (see [8]), Theorem 3.1 and the following corollaries
are useful.

Corollary 3.2
Let A be a free arrangement with exp(A) = (d1, . . . , dℓ). Take Xi ∈ Li(A) (i =
1, . . . , k) with X1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Xk such that

(1) AXk is free with exp(AXk) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−k).

(2) |AXi| − |AXi+1| = dℓ−i (i = 0, . . . , k − 1).

Then AXi is also free with exp(AXi) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−i) for i = 1, . . . , k − 1.

Proof. By Proposition 2.6, it holds that

b2(AXk−1) ≥ (|AXk−1| − |AXk|)|AXk| + b2(AXk) = X

didj.

1≤i<j≤ℓ−k+1

On the other hand, again by applying (b1, b2)-inequality, we have

X

djdi = b2(A)

Hence it holds that

Combine these two inequalities to obtain

b2(AXk−1) = X

didj.

1≤i<j≤ℓ−k+1

Hence Theorem 1.2 shows that AXk−1 is free. Apply the same argument to
all AX1, . . . , AXk−2 to complete the proof.
(cid:3)

Moreover, we do not need to assume the freeness of A as follows:

Corollary 3.3
Let A be an arrangement with |A| = b1(A) = d1 + · · · + dℓ, b2(A) =
P1≤i<j≤ℓ didj for some positive integers d1, . . . , dℓ. Take Xi ∈ Li(A) (i =
1, . . . , k) with X1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Xk such that

(1) AXk is free with exp(AXk) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−k).

(2) |AXi| − |AXi+1| = dℓ−i (i = 0, . . . , k − 1).

Then AXi is also free with exp(AXi) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−i) for i = 0, . . . , k − 1. In
particular, we do not need the freeness of AXk if k = ℓ − 2.

Proof. Apply the same argument as in the proof of Corollary 3.2 repeatedly.
When k = ℓ − 2, this is nothing but the divisonal freeness in Deﬁnition 1.5
in [2] (see also Deﬁnition 4.3).

Now let us prove Theorems 1.5.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. Let X := L ∩ H. Let exp(A) = (d1, . . . , dℓ) with
d1 = 1. Also, let exp(A′) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ − 1), where A′ := A \ {L}.
Then AL is free with exp(AL) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1) by Theorem 1.1. Hence
Theorem 2.2 shows that both (AH, mH ) and (AH, mH − δX ) are free with
exponents (d2, . . . , dℓ) and (d2, . . . , dℓ − 1) respectively, where δX : AH →
{0, 1} is a multiplicity such that δ−1
X (1) = X ∈ AH. Then Theorem 2.3 shows
that the Euler restriction (AX, m∗) of (AH, mH) onto X is also free with
exp(AX, m∗) = (d2, . . . , dℓ−1) by Theorem 2.2. Now recall that mH(X) ≥ 2
by the fact that |AX| ≥ 3. Hence Proposition 2.5 and the equality b2(A) =
b2(AH)+(|A|−|AH|)|AH| show that (AX, m∗) = (AX, mX), where (AX, mX)
is the Ziegler restriction of AH onto X. Hence (AX, mX ) is also free with
exp(AX, mX ) = (d2, . . . , dℓ−1).
In particular, |mX | = d2 + · · · + dℓ−1 =
|A| − dℓ − 1. On the other hand, again Proposition 2.5 shows that |m∗| =
b2(AH, mH) − b2(AH, mH − δX) = |AH| − 1. Since |m∗| = |mX |, we have
|A| − dℓ − 1 = |AH| − 1. Hence |A| − |AH| = dℓ, and |AH| = Pℓ
i=1 di − dℓ =
d1+· · ·+dℓ−1. So the equation b2(A) = b2(AH)+(|A|−|AH|)|AH| shows that
b2(AH) = P1≤i<j≤ℓ−1 didj. In particular, the coeﬃcient of t2 in π0(AH; t) is

9

P2≤i<j≤ℓ−1 didj = b2(AX, mX). Hence Theorem 2.4 shows that AH is free
with exp(AH) = (d1, . . . , dℓ−1).

(cid:3)

Theorem 1.5 has the following corollary.

Corollary 3.4
Let A be an ℓ-arrangement and H1, . . . , Hs ∈ A be distinct hyperplanes such
that codim ∩s
i=1Hi = 2. Assume that b2(A) = b2(AHi) + (|A| − |AHi|)|AHi|
for i = 2, . . . , s. Then all the A′
:= A \ {Hi} (i = 2, . . . , s) and B :=
i
A \ {H1, . . . , Hs} are free if H1 satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) A and A \ {H1} are free, and

(2) |AX| ≥ s + 1 for X := ∩s

i=1Hi.

Proof. Apply Theorem 1.5 to each pair H1, Hi to obtain the statement in
Theorem 1.5. Hence AHi is free for each i ≥ 2 with exponents(d1, d2, . . . , dℓ−1),
here we assume that exp(A) = (d1. . . . , dℓ), d1 = 1 and |A| − |AH1| = dℓ.
Since |AX| ≥ s + 1, it holds that

(A \ {H1, . . . , Hi})Hi+1 = AHi.

Hence Theorem 1.1 shows that A \ {H1, . . . , Hi} is free with exponents
(1, d2, . . . , dℓ−1, dℓ − i), which completes the proof,
(cid:3)

As we can see from the proof of Theorem 1.5, the following general fact

holds.

Corollary 3.5
Assume that A is free and χ(AH; t) divides χ(A; t) for H ∈ A. Then AH is
free if there is X ∈ AH such that mH (X) ≥ 2 and (AH, mH − δX ) is free.

Proof. Immediate from the proof of Theorem 1.5.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.6. Since the proof for each given condition is the same,
we show only the case (1). Assume that A′ is free. Then Theorem 1.1 shows
that AH is free with exp(AH) ⊂ exp(A). In particular, the equation b2(dA) =
b2(AH)+(|A|−|AH|−1)(|AH |−1) holds. By the proof of Theorem 1.2 in [2],
for every multiplicity m : A → Z>0 with m(Y ) ≤ mH(Y ) (Y ∈ AH), it holds
that b2(AH, m) = b2(AH) + (|m| − |AH|)(|AH| − 1). In particular, for any
Y ∈ AH with m(Y ) ≥ 2, it holds that b2(AH, m)−b2(AH, m−δY ) = |AH|−1.
By assumption (1), we may pick a multiplicity m such that m(K1) =
m(K2) = 2. Let m∗ be the Euler multiplicity of (AH, m) onto K1. Then it

10

follows that m∗(X) = 2. Hence

b2(AH, m) − b2(AH, m − δK1) = X

(b2(AH

Y ∈(AH )K1

Y ∈(AH )K1

by Lemma 3.3 (2), Lemma 3.4 and the assumption that m∗(X) = 2 > 1,
which is a contradiction. For other cases, use the same argument with the
result in [11].
(cid:3)

Let us see an example how to apply Corollary 3.2.

Example 3.6
Let A be an arrangement in V = R6 deﬁned by

1≤i<j≤6

This is the Weyl arrangement of the type D6, hence free with exp(A) =
(1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9). In general, to investigate the freeness of restrictions is very
diﬃcult. In the case of Weyl arrangements, it is proved by Orlik and Terao
in [8] that all restrictions are free, and such a free arrangement is called
hereditarily free. Here let us check freeness of some restrictions of A by
applying Corollary 3.2.

Let X1 = {x1 = x6}, X2 = {x1 = x6, x2 = x5}, X3 = {x1 = x6, x2 =
x5, x3 = x4}, and consider the freeness of AXi for i = 1, 2, 3. Then it is easy
to show that

Since AX3 is the Weyl arrangement of the type B3, it is free with exp(AX3) =
(1, 3, 5). Hence we may apply Corollary 3.2 to check the freeness of these
three arrangements.

By the equations, we can see that |A| = 30,
|AX3| = 9. Hence Corollary 3.2 shows that AX1 and AX2 are both

free with exp(AX1) = (1, 3, 5, 5, 7) and exp(AX2) = (1, 3, 5, 5).

4 Supersolvable and divisionally free arrange-

ments

First recall the deﬁnition of the supersolvable arrangement.

Deﬁnition 4.1
A is supersolvable if and only if there is a ﬂag {Xi} such that, AXi is
of rank i for i = 0, . . . , ℓ − 1 and for every H 6= L ∈ AXi+1 \ AXi, there
is K ∈ AXi such that H ∩ L ⊂ K. In this case, A is free with exp(A) =
(|A| − |AXℓ−1|, . . . , |AX2| − |AX1|, |AX1|).

Second, let us introduce a diﬀerent deﬁnition of a supersolvable arrange-
ment. We do not know whether it has been already known. Here we give a
proof for the completeness.

Proposition 4.2
A is supersolvable if and only if there is a ﬂag {Xi} such that

b2(A) =

ℓ−1

X

i=0

(|AXi+1| − |AXi|)|AXi|.

In this case, A is free with exponents exp(A) = (|AXℓ| − |AXℓ−1|, |AXℓ−1| −
|AXℓ−2|, . . . , |AX2| − |AX1|, |AX1|).

Proof. Let Ai
:= AXi. Since a supersolvable arrangement is free with
exponents in Deﬁnition 4.1, the “if” part is immediate. Assume that A
satisﬁes the equality in Proposition 4.2. Assume that the assumption for
supersolvable arrangements holds true for A0, . . . , Ai. We show that, for any
distinct H, L ∈ Ai+1 \ Ai, there is K ∈ Ai such that H ∩ L ⊂ K.

By the induction hypothesis, we know that Ai

is supersolvable with
j=0(|Aj+1| − |Aj|)|Aj|. Let H ∈ Ai+1 \ Ai. Since Ai ∪ {H}

b2(Ai) = Pi−1
is of rank i + 1 by deﬁnition of localization, it holds that

Hence

b2(Ai ∪ {H}) ≥ b2(Ai) + |Ai|.

b2(Ai+1) ≥ b2(Ai) + (|Ai+1| − |Ai|)|Ai|

i

=

X

(|Aj+1| − |Aj|)|Aj|.

j=0

12

At every i, this has to be equal since we have the equation

ℓ−1

b2(A) =

X

(|Aj+1| − |Aj|)|Aj|.

j=0

Hence it holds that b2(Ai ∪ {H}) = b2(Ai) + |Ai| for any H ∈ Ai+1 \ Ai and
i = 0, . . . , ℓ − 1.

Now assume that there are no K ∈ Ai such that H ∩ L ⊂ K. Since
|(Ai ∪ {H})H| ≥ |Ai| by the deﬁnition of the localization, the above implies
that b2(A ∪ {H}) > b2(Ai) + |Ai|, which is a contradiction. Hence for any
distinct H, L ∈ Ai+1 \ Ai, there is K ∈ Ai such that H ∩ L ⊂ K.
(cid:3)

The reason why we introduced another characterization of supersolvable
arrangements in Proposition 4.2 is to point out the similarity of the super-
solvablitiy to the divisional freeness introduced in [2].

Deﬁnition 4.3 (Divisionally free arrangement, [2], Deﬁnition 1.5)
A is divisionally free if if there is a ﬂag {Xi} such that

ℓ−2

b2(A) =

X

(|AXi| − |AXi+1|)|AXi+1|.

i=0

In this case, A is free with exponents exp(A) = (|AX0| − |AX1|, |AX1| −
|AX2|, . . . , |AXℓ−2| − |AXℓ−1|, |AXℓ−1|). Such a ﬂag is called a divisional ﬂag.

It is also shown in [2] that all inductively free arrangements are division-
ally free ([2], Theorem 1.6). Since supersolvable arrangements are inductively
free, they are of course divisionally free. Here we give an another proof of the
fact that supersolvable arrangements are divisionally free by using Proposi-
tion 4.2 and Deﬁnition 4.3 to see their similarity.

Proposition 4.4 (cf. [2], Theorem 1.6)
A supersolvable arrangement A is divisionally free.

Proof. Let A be a supersolvable arrangement with a ﬂag {Xi} as in Deﬁni-
tion 4.2. Let α1, . . . , αℓ be linear forms such that Xi = {α1 = · · · = αi = 0}.
Then deﬁne the ﬂag {Yi} by Yi := {αℓ = · · · = αℓ−i+1 = 0}. Then it is clear
that this ﬂag becomes a divisional ﬂag.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.5
By Proposition 4.2, Deﬁnition 4.3 and Proposition 4.4, supersolvable and
divisionally free arrangements are similar. They both use ﬂags for localiza-
tions and restrictions respectively. Since there are a lot of nice properties for

13

supersolvable arrangements, it is natural to ask whether some special proper-
ties which hold for supersolvable arrangements also hold true for divisionally
free arrangements.
