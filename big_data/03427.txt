The equation of state (EoS) P = P (ρ, ...) – pressure as a function of density and other ther-
modynamical quantities – is what generates particularities of mass–radius distribution M (R) for
super–dense compact stellar bodies, the remnants of cosmic cataclysms. In view of recent nuclear
experiments, we propose one particular EoS, which admits the critical state characterized by den-
sity ρc and temperature Tc, and which under certain conditions permits a radial distribution of
the super–dense matter in ”liquid” phase. We establish such conditions and demonstrate that a
stable conﬁguration is indeed possible (only) for temperatures smaller than the critical one. Us-
ing Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoﬀ equations for hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive the mass–radius
relation for the super–dense compact objects with masses smaller than the Sun, M ≪ M⊙. The
obtained results are within the constraints established by both heavy–ion collision experiments and
theoretical studies of neutron–rich matter.

INTRODUCTION

The equilibrium spherical conﬁguration of the non–
rotating self–gravitating system is found from the set
of Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoﬀ (TOV) equations [1, 2],
well known to be:

Here, all quantities are in usual units, P = P (r) is the
pressure at radius r, ρ is the mass density of the matter
which includes all forms of energy together with the rest
mass, γN is the newtonian gravitational constant, c is
the light speed. Quantity m in Eq.(2) is the ”mass inside
radius r”:

m = 4πZ r

dss2ρ(s).

(3)

The total mass of the body, M , is the integral of Eq.(3)
from 0 to R.[50] Terms ≥ c−2 and ≥ γ 2
N after decompo-
sition in series with respect to c−1 and γN of right part
of Eq. (1), give contributions produced by the eﬀects of
the special and general theories of relativity.[51]

To obtain the density distribution and the mass–radius
relationship M (R) for both ordinary stars and dense
compact objects, for a chosen equation of state (EoS)
P (ρ, ...), Eqs.(1) – (3) must be integrated subject to
boundary conditions P (R) = 0 and m(0) = 0. Obviously,
the dependence M (R) is strongly model–dependent on
the form of the EoS – a crucial point in this problem.

In this paper, for the EoS in our consideration, we
additionally allow for two possibilities: the possibility
that P (ρk) = 0 for some ρk 6= 0, and the possibility of

the existence of the critical state corresponding to some
density ρc and some temperature Tc. The realization of
the latter has been supported by nuclear experiments on
collisions of heavy nuclei (see Figs. 1 and 2).

In this paper, we establish conditions in which a super–
dense matter (governed by such EoS) can exist in its
”liquid” phase in a form of stable radial distribution (like
a droplet). We show also that such stable conﬁguration
is possible only for temperatures lower than the critical
one.

By the term ”super-dense compact object” (SDCO),
we call a gravitationally-powerful stellar body, a remnant
of a cosmic cataclysm, whose average density is of order
of the nuclear density [52], whose mass is (meaningfully)
smaller than the Sun mass, and whose physical state in
the inner region can be modeled by an EoS permitting the
multi–phase state (the region in Fig. 1 where T < 20 M ev
and ρ < 3 ÷ 4 ρ0).

The physics

(white/black dwarfs,

so-called hybrid stars) involves a complicated interplay
between nuclear processes and astrophysical phenomena
([6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]). The equation of state

and other

The rationale for the possible form of EOS has been
based on data obtained from diverse sources, such as
studies of high energy nuclear collisions, the monopole
resonance in ﬁnite heavy nuclei, astrophysical supernovae
and neutron star studies [25], [26], [27]. The general con-

2

Obviously, of importance for SDCO are the eﬀects of
the general relativity theory (GR). The signiﬁcance of the
eﬀects of gravity for a body of radius Rb with the inner
parameter εc (critical energy density), is determined by
the dimensionless parameter G = γN R2
b εc/c4 (see below)
which is small for physically–interesting situations. We
take into account that the high–density matter of any
stable object must conform with (i) causality (the speed
of propagation of small matter perturbations must not
exceed the speed of light), (ii) hydrodynamical stability.
In Sec. 2, we describe the model which permits a
radially–symmetrical distribution of mass (the choice of
an equation of state, the dimensionless formulation of the
set of equations, the necessary thermodynamical quan-
tities). The conﬁguration of non–rotating stars is de-
scribed by the relativistic equation of hydrostatic equi-
librium for a spherically symmetric body - the TOV–
equations [1, 2].
In Sec. 3, we ﬁnd the matter density
distribution. The causality condition (the speed of sound
must not exceed the speed of light) is discussed in Sec. 4.
Mass–Radius dependence for the SDCO is obtained in
Sec. 5. A special case is brieﬂy considered in Sec. 6. In
the concluding Sec. 7, we discuss the obtained results.

II. RADIALLY-SYMMETRICAL

DISTRIBUTION OF MASS

A. Equation of state

The basic equations are written above, Eqs. (1)–(3).
The principal point for the following analysis is to pro-
pose a physically reasonable explicit form of the equa-
tion of state (EoS). In fact, the exact EoS of dense
matter remains a well–kept secret of nature in spite
of decades of very intense theoretical and experimen-
tal studies (see more detailed discussion for example the
works by Haensel et al [19], Fortov [20], Potekhin [21].

A reasonable model

for the nuclear matter EOS
must be thermodynamically self–consistent and repro-
duce such quantities as normal concentration n0 and in-
compressibility factor K in the vicinity of normal nuclear
matter. At normal nuclear density the free energy must
be at minimum (then the system is mechanically stable
because of vanishing pressure P = P0 = 0) and the width
of this minimum is deﬁned by the incompressibility fac-
tor K. The behavior of the model in other regions of the
n − T plane can be then probed via heavy–ion collisions.
An important point is the so–called ground state of
nuclear matter, i.e., at T = 0 nuclear matter saturates
(pressure P = P0 = 0) at a concentration of about n0 ≃
0.16 f m−3. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is generally
attractive at nucleon–nucleon separations of > 1 f m (=
10−15m) but becomes repulsive at small separations (<
0.5 f m) making nuclear matter diﬃcult to compress. As
a consequence, most stable nuclei are at approximately
the same saturation density, ρ0 ≃ 2.8 × 1014 g/cm3, in
their interiors. Matter at densities of up to ρ ≃ 9ρ0 may

theoretically [3]. The horizontal axis shows the density of the
matter. The vertical axis shows its temperature. Both axes
are given in logarithmic scale. The density is given in multi-
ples of normal nuclear matter density ρ0 ≃ 2.8 × 1017 kg/m3
(neutron drip). For densities higher than ρ0, the nuclei begin
to dissolved and merge together by forming the neutron liq-
uid. In the range of higher densities, physical properties of the
matter are uncertain. At present, it is believed that hadronic
matter, at high enough densities, undergoes a transition to
a deconﬁned state of quarks and gluons [4], [5].
In a gen-
eral context, it is assumed that as the density–temperature
increase above the ”normal” nuclear characteristics, the mat-
ter may undergo phase transitions to qualitatively new states
(meson condensation, crystallization, quark deconﬁnement,
mixed phases, etc.): the very existence of these states de-
pends on the speciﬁc features of strong interactions and the
quark structure of baryons.

cept of the contemporary understanding is illustrated in
Fig. 1. The critical temperature Tc and the critical den-
sity of energy εc which is proportional to critical density
ρc, can be measured nowadays in nuclear experiments.
Fig. 2 presents the various experimental data.

be present in the interiors of neutron stars, and matter
at densities up to about ρ ≃ 4ρ0 may be present in the
core collapse of Type II supernovae.

In [29] (see also [3] and [30]), the empirical nuclear

equation of state (EOS), polynomial approximation,

P =

T
m

ρ − A1ρ2 + A2ρ3,

(4)

has been proposed to explain observed experimental
data. Here, T is temperature, ρ = ε/c2, ε is energy den-
sity of the matter, A1 = Tc/mρc and A2 = 2Tc/6mρ2
c.
Such EoS permits the existence of the critical state when
the ﬁrst and second derivatives of pressure with respect
to density turn zero (surface tension vanishes). Coeﬃ-
cients b and c depend directly on the value of the critical
temperature Tc, critical density ρc. Despite the fact that
a heavy nucleus is a ”repository” of strongly interact-
ing fermions, and the ﬁrst term in this formula refers
to the classical system, Eq. (4) works well and permits
to satisfactorily describe results of experiments. This is
explained by the fact that the ﬁnite system of strongly
interacting fermions is satisfactorily described in terms
of Green’s function as an ensemble of (localized in ﬁnite
volume) collective perturbations (of the spin zero) which
have the non–zero eﬀective ”mass” and the degree of ex-
citation of which can be characterized by some eﬀective
”temperature”.

The meaning of Eq. (4), or other interpolating expres-
sions below, is as follows: In the gas state under normal
conditions when p ∼ ρ, interaction between particles is
very weak. As the interaction (pressure) increases, the
properties of the system diﬀer more and more from the
properties of the ideal gas, and ﬁnally the gas enters its
condensed state – liquid.
In the liquid state, interac-
tion between particles is great, and properties of this
interaction strongly depend on the speciﬁc type of the
liquid. This is the reason why general formulae, describ-
ing quantitatively properties of liquids, do not exist (see
[31]–[34]). However, it is possible to propose some in-
terpolation formula which can qualitatively describe the
transition between the gas and liquid (as done in the Van
der Waals classical model). Such formula must produce
qualitatively correct results in two limit cases. For rar-
iﬁed gases it should converge into formulae correct for
ideal gases. But as the density increases, it should incor-
porate the fact that the compressibility of the matter is
limited. Such formula then would qualitatively describe
the gas behavior in the transition state.

Eq. (4) represents only one of the numerous possible
interpolation formulae satisfying the posed requirements.
There are no physical reasons to prefer one such interpo-
lation over the others. But the form (Eq. 4) is one of the
simplest and easiest to work with.

The equations of state of a multi–body system of nu-
cleons interacting via Skyrme potential is presented in
Fig. 3. The very steep part of the isotherms (on the
left side) corresponds to the liquid phase. The gas phase
is presented by the right parts of the isotherms where

3

pressure is changing smoothly with increasing volume.
Of special interest is the part of the diagram where the
isotherms correspond to the negative compressibility, i.e.
(∂P/∂V )T > 0. This is the so-called spinodal zone where
the matter phase is unstable and can exist in both liq-
uid and/or gas states.[54] Within the spinodal zone lies a
particularly unstable two–phased region (marked by the
hatched line in Fig. 4), in which random density ﬂuctua-
tions lead to almost instantaneous collapse of the initially
uniform system into a mixture of two phases. For nuclear
matter, it is either liquid droplets surrounded by gas of
neutrons, or homogeneous neutron liquid with neutron–
gas bubbles (i.e. the spinodal zone where the squire of
adiabatical speed is negative, is inside the coexistence
zone where the squire of isothermical speed is negative).

Figure 3:
The equations of state P (V ) for a nuclear
system interacting through a Skyrme potential and a Van
der Waals compressible liquid–gas system (shown in relative
units). (From [29].)

Critical temperature Tc for the liquid-gas phase tran-
sition is a crucial characteristic of the nuclear equation
of state.

A typical set of isotherms for an equation of state (EoS)
- pressure versus density with a constant temperature -
corresponding to nuclear interaction (Skyrme eﬀective in-
teraction and ﬁnite temperature of Hartree–Fock theory,
see [29]) is shown in Fig. 5. It exhibits the maximum-
minimum structure typical of the VdW–like EoS. De-
pending on the eﬀective interaction chosen and on the
model (see [29], [37], [38], [39]), the nuclear equation of
state exhibits a critical point at ρc ≃ (0.3 ÷ 0.4)ρ0 and
Tc ∼ 5 ÷ 18 M eV ([18], [28]). Calculations of Tc were
performed in [3], [29], [30], [40], [41], [42]. Experimental
data are presented in Fig. 2.

Some model EoS – pressure vs. internal energy density

– are given in Appendix A.

system of obtained equations with an EoS p = p(θ, z)
contains now only one dimensionless parameter G ∼ a2
which is deﬁned by the size of the SDCO, a.

If G ≪ 1, we write in Eqs. (7) and (8) (1 − Gf )−1 ≃
(1 + Gf + ...) and neglect further small terms of order G4
(and higher). The newtonian approximation corresponds
to contribution of terms ∼ G1. The eﬀects of relativity
are taken into consideration in such approximated ver-
sion of Eqs. (7) and (8) – terms with p in right part of
Eq. (8) following from special relativity, and terms ≃ G2
following from the GR. In the deﬁnition of the small pa-
rameter G, γN is the gravity constant, c is the light speed,
dimensionless m = mn/Tc, εc = ρcTc/mn.

The set of equations (7) – (8) is subject to boundary

conditions (see below).

C. Thermodynamical quantities

All principal thermodynamical quantities such as pres-
sure, internal energy, sound speed and so on, can be cal-
culated when a thermodynamical potential is given (see
Appendix, Eqs.(B2). Sometime, this is the free energy of
the system which is preferable for description of a speciﬁc
system. To illustrate, we consider the simplest mono–
component system composed of N particles occupying
volume V . Following the deﬁnition, the full free energy
of a system is a function of temperature T and of vol-
ume, F = F (T, V, N ). With respect to one particle, with
ﬁnite n = N/V even when N → ∞, V → ∞ (thermo-
dynamical system), the fundamental thermodynamical
relationship is written as dF1 = −s1dT − P d(n−1) with
the chemical potential µ1 per one particle deﬁned from
F1 + P n−1 − µ1 = 0.

Introducing the dimensionless thermodynamical argu-
ments z = n/nc, θ = T /Tc, F1 = Tcf , P = ncTcp, we
have the expressions

expressed in units of ρnucleus ≃ 2.85 × 1014 g/cm3. Tempera-
ture is expressed in M ev units (1 M ev ≃ 1010K).

also, [36].

Here, m, a1, a2, a3 are dimensionless constants, the func-
tion Li2(−x) is the polylogarithm function of argument
x. In limit cases, Li2(−x) ≃ −x + x2/4 − x3/9 + ... for
x → 0, and Li2(−x) ≃ π2/6 − (1/2) ln2(1/x) + (1/x) ...
for x → ∞. The physical meaning of every term in f and
numerical values of constants a1, a2, a3 will be discussed
later. The last term is added to set the value of entropy
equal to zero at the critical point. This additional term
changes nothing in measurable quantities (pressure, in-
ternal energy, etc).

The model Eq.(11) must produce the following results:
(a) the EoS following from Eq.(11) has to have a form
permitting the existence of the critical point where p =
∂zp = 0; (b) pressure p(z1) = 0 when z1 6= 0; (c) the
critical density ρc is of order of (0.1 ÷ 0.4) ρ0, i.e. z1 ≃
(3 ÷ 7); (d) compressibility factor K ∼ (240 ÷ 300) M ev;
(e) the principle of causality is respected - the adiabatical
sound speed is always smaller than the light speed - V 2
s <
1.

The dimensionless pressure and volume density of in-

ternal energy are calculated now as (see Appendix B)

Here, pressure and internal energy per volume unit con-
tain terms which are proportional to eﬀective tempera-
ture as for the classical ideal gas. Simple consideration
shows that the free energy per one particle f cannot be
a polynome of power higher then 1. In fact, let, for large
z, the leading term in f be proportional to some power
of z, i.e. f ∼ zν−1 with ν > 1. Since (see Appendix B
and Eqs. (12) and (13)), p = z 2∂zf ∼ (ν − 1)zν and
ε = −zθ2∂θ(f /θ) ∼ zν with the same coeﬃcients of pro-
portionality, the adiabatical sound speed (normalized by
the light speed square) V 2
s = (∂p/∂ε)s → (ν − 1) for
z → ∞. This gives the one possibility: ν = 2. Obvi-
ously, it follows from here that the interpolating function
in Eq. (11) must tend to zero, when z → 0, not so fast
as a linear function of z, and tend to inﬁnity not faster
then z 1 when z → ∞.

Expression (13), as well as Eq. (12), has a simple phys-
ical meaning: the ﬁrst term mz is determined by the rest
mass of particles, the second is connected with heat mo-
tion, the third describes interaction (attraction) of parti-
cles for moderate density of matter, the last term is con-
nected with repulsion due to hard ”core” inside particles.
If there are no ”wonders” in the region of moderate densi-
ties, z ∼ 1, the interpolating function can be taken in the
simple (quasi-logarithmic) form. The physical reasons of
such comportment are the subject of more detailed and
speciﬁc investigation which are outside the framework of
this paper.

The constants a1, a2, a3 are ﬁxed by the following three
conditions: (a, b) the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the
pressure p(z, θ) are zero in the critical point z = 1, θ =
1; (c) the dimensionless factor of incompressibility must
give the experimentally obtained value.

5

The value of z(1) for diﬀerent temperatures θ is found
from the condition at the boundary p(z(1), θ) = 0. The
physical solution of this equation exists not for all values
of parameters. The dependence z(1, θ)), or θ = θ(z(1)),
is shown in Fig. 6.

phase exists when 0 < θ < θmax = 0.826 and when zmin(1) =
1.74 < z(1) < zmax(1) = 5.5 (the right part of the curve).

The important parameter for any EoS is the incom-
pressibility factor K.
It measures the stiﬀness of the
EOS, usually deﬁned as a slope of the pressure at the
point of fundamental state (saturation point): K ∼
(∂nP )T →0, n→n0 (in usual units). This expression (in
its dimensionless form used in the paper) is written as
κ = (9z 2∂zzε)θ→0, z→z0 .
In fact, κ = 9(∂zp) is equal
to κ = 9∂z(z 2∂zf ) = 9z 2∂zzf in the fundamental state
(when θ = 0 and z = z1 where p(z1, 0) = 0). When
θ → 0, we can use f = ε. The module of inelas-
ticity is expressed in M ev when Tc is given in M ev:
K = Tcκ. The experimental value of the parameter
is of order 200 ÷ 300 M ev (see for example [43]) with
a value of K = 300 M eV (with considerable error), or
K = 180 ÷ 240 M eV from [44], [45]. Some experimental
value of the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear mat-
ter at its saturation density n0 has been determined to
be 210 ± 30 M eV [19]. So, the situation is still not very
clear: the analysis of the sideward anisotropy observed
in the heavy ions collisions at low and intermediate en-
ergies require K ≃ 210 M eV , whereas the the elliptic
ﬂow anisotropy observed in the same experiment requires
K ≃ 300 M eV [46], [47].

In the framework of our model when the critical tem-
perature is taken as Tc = 17.5 M ev, we ﬁnd for pa-
rameters a1, a2, a3, z1 numerical values a1 = 1.225, a2 =
1.841, a3 = 1.074, z1 = 5.5 with the factor of incom-
pressibility κ = 16.533 (i.e. K = 289.3 M ev), which is a
satisfactory result given the approximations made along
the way.

The behavior of pressure p(z, θ) calculated from
Eqs.(9) and (11), is shown in Fig.7 for diﬀerent temper-
atures.

The behavior of internal energy per volume unit is

shown in Figs.8 and 9.

The adiabatical sound speed (i.e. speed of propagation
of small ”acoustical” perturbations = the speed of trans-
port of energy = the speed of transport of information)
for very high densities must not be greater than the light
speed.

The adiabatical (dimensionless here) sound speed for
relativistic ﬂuid is calculated using the expression V 2

ature θ = 1.0 (upper line).

Fig.10 shows the pressure p vs internal energy den-
sity ε relation for the matter in liquid phase with limit
temperatures θ1 = 0.8255 and θ0 = 0 for which the liq-
uid state, θ0 < θ < θ1, can exist. When z ≫ 1, the
limit curves tend to the universal relation p = ε. The
proposed model is not in contradiction with the exist-
ing models (see Fig.21). For example, according to our
model, when e = Tcncε = 1050 M ev/f m3 (with Tc =
17.5 M ev and nc = 0.03 f m−3), we obtain for the pres-
sure P = Tcncp = 210 M ev/f m3, i.e. the p(ε) depen-
dence shown in Fig.11 is near the RMF (npKH) model.

pressure and internal energy in the model are functions
of density z and temperature θ. Therefore, it is more
natural to calculate V 2
s using the Jacobians and their
properties (see [31], [48] for more information). Using
the Jacobians we can ﬁnd the expression

∂ε(cid:19)s

pz − sz(sθ)−1pθ

Eqs.(B2), (14) with (11) permit calculating of all
derivatives in Eq. (14) and ﬁnding V 2

speed of sound in our model always satisﬁes the condi-
tion V 2
s < 1 (Fig. 13). The system becomes unstable
with respect to small spontaneous perturbations (ﬂuctu-
ations) when V 2

s < 0 (Fig. 12).

that small spontaneous initial perturbations of density will
grow exponentially fast. The development of the instability
in a homogeneous medium leads to formation of a two–phase
conﬁguration when liquid (drops) and gas (vapor) states co–
exist. Only the states corresponding to temperatures below

IV. RADIAL DENSITY DISTRIBUTION

Eqs. (7), (8), (12) and (13) complete the system of
equations from which a radially–symmetrical distribu-
tion of mass within the SDCO can be found. The set
of the equations is subject to the boundary conditions
p(1) = 0, m(0) = 0. At this point, there is a diﬀerence
with traditional approaches when Eqs. (7) – (8) are nu-
merically integrated for a given central density.

We write in Eqs. (7),(8), (12) and (13) z = z(1) +
Gz1(s)+G2z2(s)+G3z3(s)+... and m = (4π/3)z(1)s3(1+

The ﬁrst boundary condition is obviously zi(1) = 0.
The second is not µi(0) = 0 because z(1) 6= z(0): when
s → 0, m(s) has to tend to 4π/3)z(0)s3 + ... in leading
approximation. The boundary condition for µi(s) when
s = 1, is chosen after solving the set of equations from
condition that the quantity m(s) has no singularities at
any point in the region 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. Thus, µi(1) are the
proper values of the set equations.

After substitution of these expressions into Eq. (8),
and equating coeﬃcients with the same power of Gn, we
obtain the set of equations for the normalized density
add-on zi(r) and mass add-on µi(r) which is resolved by
the standard procedure.

V. MASS–RADIUS RELATIONSHIP

The density distribution for the hot SDCO with θ =

0.824, is shown in Figs.(17) and (18).

The mass–radius relationship follows from Eq. (5). To
simplify the ﬁnal expressions, we introduce special units:
the mass Mb of a SDCO will be measured in 10−3M⊙
units and the radius, Rb = 10−6R⊙a, is a units. Here,
the Sun’s mass and radii are denoted by ⊙. Numerically,
R⊙ = 7 × 108 m the mass of the Sun M⊙ ≃ 2 × 1030 kg,
γN = 6.67 × 10−11 , c = 2.99 × 107 m/s, ρc ≃ 0.35ρ0.

The mass–radii relationship becomes

VI. CONCLUSION

We considered conditions for which SDCOs – small
stellar bodies with a speciﬁc nuclear equation of state –
can exist in the nature. The SDCO’s mass as a function
of its size, has been obtained.

The principal point of the work is the interpolating ex-
pression for the dimensionless free energy (Eq. 11) from

which all thermodynamical quantities can be found. The
expression for the free energy reﬂects the following limit
conditions:
for small densities, z → 0, the interaction
between particles is weak, and the dominant term is the
ﬁrst term which describes a gas of non-interacting par-
ticles. As the density increases, the properties of the
system diﬀer more and more from the properties of the
ideal gas, the interaction (logarithmic term in expression
for pressure) becomes more and more signiﬁcant. With
more increasing of density, z ≫ 1, the gas enters its con-
densed state (liquid) when the term ∼ z in expression
for f is the most important. For high densities z, the
equation of state has to be ”hardened” to account for
the dominance of the ”repulsive core” in the potential of
particle interaction. In such ”hardened” state, repulsion
between particles is very strong, and the properties of
this interaction no longer depend on the speciﬁc type of
the liquid, thus the corresponding term in the free en-
ergy has to have a universal form for the pressure p ∼ z 2
corresponding to arguments of [6].

The proposed model Eq.(11) responded to the follow-

9

ing requirements: (a) the EoS following from Eq.(11) has
to have a form admitting the existence of the critical
point where p = ∂zp = 0; (b) the pressure p(z1) = 0 for
some value z1 6= 0; (c) the critical density ρc is of order of
(0.1 ÷ 0.4) ρ0, i.e. z1 ≃ (3 ÷ 7); (d) compressibility factor
K ∼ (240 ÷ 300) M ev; (e) the principle of causality is
respected - the adiabatical sound speed is always smaller
than the light speed.

The proposed model of the EoS permitted to construct

a spherical self–gravitating conﬁguration: the SDCO.

In Figs. 7 - 20 we graphically illustrate some of the
obtained results: the equations of state p(z, θ) and the
square of sound speed V 2
s (z, θ) for various values of tem-
perature θ (and scale zooms for z), resulting from the
model (Eq. 11). The calculations have been made with
parameters a1 = 1.225, a2 = 1.841, a3 = 1.074. The
ﬁgures demonstrate the existence of the spinodal zone
for temperatures below critical, where the square of the
sound speed is negative. This signiﬁes that the speed of
sound is imaginary in the domain, indicating that small
spontaneous initial perturbations of matter density grow
exponentially fast in beginning of process. The instability
process leads to formation of the liquid–gas phase state.
The model correctly captures the principle of causality
when the speed of propagation of small perturbation of
matter density is smaller then the light speed.

Any process pushing the system from initial ”liquid”
state (z0, θ0) into the spinodal region for example adia-
batically (following to lines θ = θ0(z/z0)2/3), leads to in-
stability development and fragmentation. To obtain such
a situation, it is suﬃcient to ”rarify” some domain of the
SDCO (for example ρ0 → ρ0/2). It can be accomplished
by a sharp deceleration of the SDCO.

A stationary spherical conﬁguration exists only if the
boundary condition for pressure p = 0 is respected for
some z1 6= 0. With respect to Fig. 7, this signiﬁes that
there is intersection of curves p = p(z, θ1) for given θ1
with horizontal axis p = 0. The z1 6= 0 is the boundary
value of density which corresponds to p(z1, θ1) = 0. If
some mechanism (for example due to a simple decelera-
tion of the object colliding with another massive object)
introduces some quantity of heat into the SDCO, the sys-
tem passes into a new state characterized by a new value
of temperature, θ1 → θ2 > θ1. In this case, the curve of
p(z, θ2) may not intersect the horizontal axis p = 0: in-
stead, for example, of the middle or lowest lines in Fig. 7,
the conﬁguration will be characterized by the upper line.
This signiﬁes that an equilibrium spherical conﬁguration
for the SDCO does not exist more: all is manifested as an
explosion of the system and its destruction in multitude
of fragments which can be unstable too with respect to
speciﬁc nuclear reactions.

The model admits a generalization to a multi–
component system, including thermic radiation. For this,
the expression for the free energy must be replaced by the
sum of the free energy expression for every component.

Appendix A: Actually existing models of the EoS

A number of models for the EoS of neutron matter
have been presented in literature over the years. Ac-
cording to [49] where the references are presented, these
models can roughly be classiﬁed as follows: Thomas-
Fermi based models; Schroedinger-based models (e.g.
variational approach, Monte Carlo techniques, hole line
expansion (Brueckner theory), coupled cluster method,
Green function method); Relativistic ﬁeld-theoretical
treatments (relativistic mean ﬁeld (RMF), Hartree-Fock
(RHF), standard Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF), den-
sity dependent RBHF (DD-RBHF); Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) models; Chiral SU(3) quark mean ﬁeld model . A
collection of equations of state computed for several of
these models is shown in Fig. 21.

Figure 21: Some models for pressure versus energy density
of neutron matter (from [49]). The notation is as follows:
RMF is the relativistic mean-ﬁeld model; DD-RBHF is the
density dependent relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock model;
”n” are neutrons, ”p” are protons, ”H” are hyperons, ”K” is
is the K[u, s] meson condensate; ”Q” signiﬁes (u, d, s) quarks;
”H-matter” is the H-dibaryon condensate.

All presented here models show a monotone depen-
dence of pressure as function of energy density in the
region of moderate values, and the two–phase state of
matter is not realized in framework of the models.

Appendix B: Thermodynamical potentials and

related quantities

1. Thermodynamical observables

Diﬀerent thermodynamical quantities can be used in

the macroscopical description of the system.

The fundamental thermodynamic relationship (FTR)
for the change of the internal energy U of a system is
dU = T dS − P dV + µdN . Here, all quantities have the

10

standard meaning and dimension, T is the temperature
of the system, S is the entropy, P is pressure, V is the full
volume, µ is the chemical potential, and N is full number
of particles. It follows from here that U = U (S, V, N ).

For the free energy F = U − T S, we obtain from the
ﬁrst law of thermodynamics that dF = −SdT − P dV +
µdN . From here it follows that the free energy is a func-
tion of temperature, volume, and number of particles:
F = F (T, V, N ). If we introduce quantities reported to
one particle, F = F1N , S = s1N , V = M/mnn, N = nV
where M is the full mass of the system, V is its volume,
mn is the nucleon mass, we can write that the free en-
ergy reported to one particle is F1 = −P/n + µ1 and
its diﬀerential is dF1 = −s1dT − P d(1/n). The pressure
is thus a function of temperature and particle concentra-
tion: P (T, n) = n2(∂F1/∂n). The chemical potential and
the internal energy also per one particle are µ1 = ∂n(nF1)
and u1 = −T 2∂T (F1/T ). The internal energy reported to
volume unit (which has the same dimension as pressure)
is given by E1 = nu1 = −nT 2∂T (F1/T ).

For the dimensionless quantities deﬁned by expres-
sions F1 = Tcf, n = ncz, P = Tcncp, T = Ncθ, µ1 =
Tcµ, u1 = Tcu, E1 = Tcncε, we can write

df = −sdθ − pd(1/z)

(B1)

Pressure p, entropy s and the volume density of internal
energy ε are calculated as

p = z 2∂zf,

s = −∂θf,

ε = −zθ2∂θ

f
θ

.

(B2)

Note, if the free energy f is given as a function of density
z and temperature θ, the other thermodynamical quan-
tities depend on z and θ too.

In some situations, the so-called grand canonical po-
tential, Ω, also called the Landau free energy, or Landau
potential, is more useful. The quantity Ω is deﬁned via
the full free energy F of the system as Ω = F − µN =
U − T S − µN . The change of the grand potential is
found from deﬁnition of Ω and the FTR and is given by
dΩ = −SdT − P dV − N dµ. This expression shows that
the grand canonical potential is a function of parame-
ters V, T, µ: Ω = Ω(V, T, µ). Letting N = n V , S = s V
and Ω = ω V , we obtain that V (dω + s dT + ndµ) =
−(ω + P )dV . It follows from here that, for homogeneous
thermodynamical systems, P = −ω(T, µ), or Ω = −P V
and dω = −s dT − ndµ [32]. The density of particles is
given by derivative n(T, µ) = (∂P/∂µ), the entropy re-
ported to the unit of volume is s(T, µ) = (∂P/∂T ) and
the internal energy (in terms T, µ) reported to volume
unit is u(T, µ) ≡ (U/V ) = −P + T (∂P/∂T ) + µ(∂P/∂µ).
The combination u(T, µ) − T s(T, µ) gives a volume den-
sity of generalized free energy f = f (T, µ) with f =
−P + µ(∂P/∂µ) which is equally expressed in terms T, µ:
the function f has the same dimension as pressure P .
Resolving n = n(T, µ) → µ = µ(T, n), one ﬁnds f in
traditional form f (T, µ(T, n))
