ABSTRACT

In the present work we investigate the Hojman symmetry in FRW cosmology. In particular, we
use the Hojman symmetry to ﬁnd conserved quantities of particular cosmological models. Next,
we study the Hojman symmetry in the scalar-tensor cosmology and ﬁnd corresponding exact forms
of integrals of motion. Finally, the formalism of the Hojman symmetry is extended to dynamical
systems with the higher-order equations of motion.

INTRODUCTION

Symmetry plays a crucial role in the modern theoretical and mathematical physics. Using symmetry
it becomes possible to select models starting from a fundamental laws of physics and constructing exact
solutions of physical models. There are several fundamental symmetries such as Lie symmetry, Noether
symmetry, Hojman symmetry, and etc. While the Lie symmetry and the Noether symmetry have been
known for long time and actively used to investigate physical systems, the Hojman symmetry is a new
one. The Noether symmetry and the Lie symmetry for various cosmological models has widely been
investigated (see [1]-[4]).In contrast to them, the Hojman symmetry for cosmological models is relatively
less studied [5]-[7]. In contrast to Noether symmetry, in the Hojman symmetry the conservation laws can
be constructed without using Hamiltonian or Lagrangian functions. It can be obtained by using just the
equations of motion without refering to the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian. It is interesting to note that
the conserved quantities obtained by using Hojman symmetry can be diﬀerent from the ones that are
obtained in Noether symmetry approach. Motivated by these intriguing challenge the Hojman symmetry
has recently been extensively used to study some models of gravity and cosmology (see Refs. [8]-[14]).

In this paper we study the Hojman symmetry for some cosmological models with the matter given by
the Chaplygin gases as well as with the van der Waals gas. We also generalize the Hojman symmetry
for the physical systems whose equations of motion are given by the third-order and the fourth-order
ordinary diﬀerential equations. The main motivation to extend the Hojman symmetry to the higher-
order dynamical systems was to study it, for instance, in F (R) modiﬁed gravity theory in the metric
formalism.
In fact, the equations of motion of the F (R) gravity in the metric approach are of the
fourth-order.

The layout of the paper is following. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy review some main points of the Hojman
symmetry. In Sec. III, we consider the Hojman symmetry for the one and two dimensional dynamical
systems given by the Friedmann equations. Sec. IV is devoted to study some cosmological models of the
universe ﬁlled by Chaplygin gases and the van der Waals gas. The Hojman symmetry for the scalar-tensor
gravity theory was investigated in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we consider Problem B, in which using the given
conserved quantity, we can recover (ﬁnd) the dynamical system (that is its equations of motion). The
relation between integrable systems and the Hojman symmetry we study in Sec. VII. Next, in Sec. VIII,
we extend the Hojman symmetry for the models with the equations of motion which are given by the
third-order and fourth-order ordinary diﬀerential equations and for some other cases. The last section is
devoted to Conclusions.

II. BRIEF REVIEW OF HOJMAN SYMMETRY: q-EQUATIONS

In this section, we provide basic elements of the Hojman symmetry for the q-equations [6]. Let qi
be coordinates of some physical system. We assume that they satisfy the following set of second order
ordinary diﬀerential equations

¨qi = Fi (qj, ˙qj, t) ,

(1)

where i, j = 1, . . . , N and a dot stands for a derivative with respect to time t, Fi (qj, ˙qj, t) is a ”force”.
In this paper, Eq.(1) we call as the q-equations. Let qi and ˜qi be solutions of the same equations (1) (up
to ǫ2 terms) [6]. We assume that these solutions are related by the following inﬁnitesimal transformation

where Xi = Xi (qj, ˙qj, t) is a symmetry vector for Eq.(1). It satisﬁes the following set of second order
linear equations [6]

˜qi = qi + ǫXi (qj, ˙qj, t) ,

where

Eq.(3) is called the X-equation. Let the ”force” Fi satisfy the equation (in some coordinate systems)

Then the quantity

obeys the equation

that is a conserved quantity for Eq.(1). Note that there exists one generalization of the last three
equations.
Instead of the equation (6), let the ”force” Fi satisfy (in some coordinate systems) the
generalized equation

Here we assume that γ = γ(qi) is a function of qi. In this case, the quantity Q takes the form

which is again a conserved quantity for Eq.(1). If γ = const., then Eqs.(8) and (9) transform to Eqs.(5)
and (6) respectively.

For the pedagogical reason, here we present an example from [5] which is the clasical example of the
presentation to see how work the Hojman symmetry. Consider the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
Its equations of motion reads as [5]

¨q1 = F1,
¨q2 = F2,

(11)

where

Hence we obtain

so that we ﬁnally have

III. HOJMAN CONSERVED QUANTITIES FOR FRIEDMAN EQUATIONS

We consider a spatially ﬂat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe whose line element is given

by

equations and the continuity equation read as

(ρ + p) = 0,

(25)
(26)

(27)

where ρ and p are the density and pressure of the matter. This set of equations has the following integral

that is ˙Q = 0, where n, m are contants and ∂−1
as

t =R dt. The set of equations (25)-(27) can be rewritten

where

− ρ = 0,
2 ˙H + ρ + p = 0,
˙ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0,

H =

is the Hubble parameter. From these 3 equations just 2 equations are indefendent. Thus for 3 unknown
functions a, ρ, p or H, ρ, p, we have only 2 equations. Let us return to the set (25)-(27) or that equivalent
to the set (28)-(30). Choosing 2 equations from these 3 equations we will come to the one-domensional
or two-dimensional dynamical systems. We now consider these cases.

A. The one-dimensional dynamical system

First, we consider the one-domensional dynamical systems. Let us return to the set (25)-(27) or that

equivalent to the set (28)-(30).

Example 1. Consider the following set of equations

1. Variant-1

3H 2

− ρ = 0,
2 ˙H + ρ + p = 0,

Following [6] we now introduce the coordinate q1 as

q1 = ln a.

Thus ˙q1 = H and the equation (32) takes the form

˙q2
1 =

1
3

ρ.

The one-dimensional dynamical system is given by

¨q1 = F1,

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

where

F1 = −

1
2

(3 ˙q2

1 + p).

Example 2. Now let us consider the following set of equations
− ρa2 = 0,
6¨a + (3ρ + p)a = 0,

3 ˙a2

The coordinate q1 we choose as

Thus Eq.(32) takes the form

q1 = a.

˙q2
1 =

1
3

ρq2
1.

Thus in this case, the one-dimensional dynamical system reads as

where

¨q1 = F1,

F1 = −

6(cid:18)pq1 +

9 ˙q2

q1 (cid:19) .

2. Variant-2

Example 1. We now consider the following set of equations
− ρ = 0,
˙ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0,

3H 2

Following [6] we now introduce the coordinate q2 as

or

q2 = ∂−1
t ρ

ρ = ˙q2.

Finally we get the another version of the one-dimensional dynamical system

¨q2 = F2,

where

F2 = −p3 ˙q2( ˙q2 + p).
Example 2. Now let us consider the following set of equations
− ρa2 = 0,
(ρ + p) = 0,

The coordinate q2 we choose as in (46). Then the one-dimensional dynamical system takes the form

that is same with (49).

¨q2 = F2,

F2 = −p3 ˙q2( ˙q2 + p)

(53)

(54)

B. The two-dimensional dynamical system

Let us return to the set of equations (28)-(30). As we mentioned above, in this set of equations are

indefendent just two. In this subsection we consider the two-dimensional dynamical systems.

Here we consider the last two equations of the set (25)-(27) that is

1. Variant-1

Using the deﬁnitions of the coordinates (34) and (41) (H = ˙q1,

ρ = ˙q2), the last system takes the form

2 ˙H + ρ + p = 0,
˙ρ + 3H(ρ + p) = 0,

(55)
(56)

where

Hence we get

so that we have

or

¨q1 = F1,
¨q2 = F2,

F1 = −

In this step we need the equation of state that is the explicit form of the function p = p(ρ). In the next
section we consider some examples.

Here we consider the last two equations of the set (25)-(27) that is

(ρ + p) = 0,

(63)

(64)

Using the deﬁnitions of the coordinates (34) and (41) (q = a,

¨q1 = F1,
¨q2 = F2,

where

F1 = −

In this step we need the equation of state that is the explicit form of the function p = p(ρ). In the next

sections we consider some examples.

IV. HOJMAN CONSERVED QUANTITIES AND SOME COSMOLOGICAL GAS MODELS

In this section, we apply the Hojman symmetry to some cosmological gas models. We consider the

Chaplygin and modiﬁed Chaplygin gas models and the van der Waals gas model.

The most popular gas is the so-called Chaplygin gas whose equation of state reads as

A. Chaplygin gas

or

Then Eq.(1) takes the form

where

Hence we get

Substituting this expression into Eq.(8) we obtain

We can rewrite this equation as

For this equation we see that the left-hand side is a function of
˙q1 only. At the same time the right-hand
side of this equation is a function of q1 only. It means that they must be equal to a same constant in
order to ensure that Eq.(39) always holds. Let this constant be κ. Now Eq.(39) can be separated into
two ordinary diﬀerential equations of the form

Their solutions have the forms

The EoS parameter is

where n = (κ + 6)/3. We now ﬁnd X1, whose equation reads as

To ﬁnd solutions of this equation we consider some particular cases.

i) Example 1. X1 = B( ˙q)eβq. Then Eq.(48) gives

˙q2
1β2B + 2βF ˙qB ˙q + βF B + F2B ˙q ˙q − β ˙qF ˙qB = 0

or

where y = ˙q. Let B = ǫym. Then we get

β2y2B + 2βyF By + βF B + F2Byy − βyFyB = 0,

β2y4 + 2βmy2F + βy2F + F2m(m − 1) − βy3Fy = 0,

F (y) = −

3y3 − 3y.

Let m = 1. Then we obtain

This equation holds if β = 0.

So ﬁnally the conserved quantity Q is given by

β2y4 + 3βy2F − βy3Fy = 0.

Q = −κǫ ˙q + F ˙q =

A
3 ˙q3 − 3 ˙q − κǫ ˙q = const.

B. Modiﬁed Chaplygin gas

In this section, our aim is to ﬁnd the Hojman symmetry for the Friedmann equations with the modiﬁed

Chaplygin gas (MCG). The EoS of the MCG is given by

where γ, α, β are real constants. Using (21) this formula can be rewritten as

p = γ + αρ +

Then Eq.(25) takes the form

p = γ + 3α ˙q2 +

Hence we get

F ( ˙q1) = −

The solution of this equation has the form

At the same time, from the left-side of the equation (60) it follows that

Its solution is given by

(106)

Let us now ﬁnd X1. The solution of the equation (3) for X1 we look for as X1 = ǫ ˙q1. It means that for
this particular form of X1 the Hojman conserved quantity has the same form as (54).

C. The van der Waals model

Our next example is the van der Waals gas model. Its EoS reads as

The van der Waals model reduces to the perfect ﬂuid case in the limit β, ǫ → 0, i.e. limβ,ǫ→0 p = αρ. Let
us rewrite Eq.(69) in terms of q1 as

p =

V. HOJMAN CONSERVED QUANTITIES IN SCALAR-TENSOR COSMOLOGY

We consider the FRW space-time. In this case the equations of the GR with the scalar ﬁeld reads as

We now introduce two coordinates as

In terms of q1 and q2, Eq.(95) takes the form

q1 = ln a,

q2 = φ.

At the same time, Eqs.(96)-(97) form as

˙q2
1 =

3(cid:2)0.5 ˙q2

2 + V (q2)(cid:3) .

¨q1 = F1,
¨q2 = F2,

where

Thus we have

∂ ln γ
∂q1 − ˙q2

∂ ln γ

.

This equation has the following particular solution

γ = γ0e3q1.

We now ﬁnd X1 and X2 whose equations have the form

1 + 2V (q2) = const.

13

(130)

(131)

(132)

(133)

(134)

In fact it is not diﬃcult to verify that ˙I = 0 if q1 and q2 satisfy Eq.(87) and Eq.(88). Note that the
integral of motion I is nothing but the equation (95) as I = 0.

VI. PROBLEM B: FROM Q TO THE q - EQUATION

A. The one-dimensional case

In the previous sections we worked according to the line

Eq.(1) =⇒ Fi =⇒ Xi =⇒ Q.

(135)

It means that the equation (1) (dynamical system) is given, we must ﬁnd Q using the equations (6) or
(9). It is Problem A. In Problem A, we know only Eq.(1), in other words, we know only the functions
Fi (that is Fi are given). All other quatities we must ﬁnd. Now let us consider Problem B. In Problem
B we work in the vice verse direction. In Problem B, we know just Q (conserved quantity) that is
Q is given and all other quatities are unknown. Let the equation (1) (dynamical system) is not given
(unknown), but the conserved quantity Q is given. So that we must recover the unknown (not given)
”force”Fi that is the equation (1) (dynamical system) starting from the known (given) conserved quantity
Q. The corresponding work line is

Q ⇒ Fi =⇒ Xi =⇒ Eq.(1).

(136)

But the problem is how recover Fi that is the dynamical system, the q-equations (1). It is an idea which
we try study here. For simplicity, below we consider the case when N = 1 that just the one dimensional
dynamical system. In this case we can put q1 = q, F1 = F and X1 = X. Let Q is given, then F we can
be ﬁnd using the formula

F = −

∂Q

∂t + ˙q ∂Q

∂q

∂Q
∂ ˙q

.

(137)

which follows from the equation (7). To ﬁnd the symmetry vector X, we recall the equation (6). It we
rewrite as

where

Q = LX,

L = 2

(138)

(139)

It gives us

X = L−1Q,

14

(140)

It is the desired expression for the symmetry vector X. Here we note that, in the same time, this
expression of X must satisﬁes the equation (3). To demonstrate our approach, we now consider some
simple examples (toy models).

1. Example 1: Q = h(q)e

˙q2
2β

Let the conserved quantity Q is given and has the form

Q = h(q)e

˙q2
2β ,

where h is a funstion of q. From (154) we obtain

F = F (q) = −

β∂h
h∂q

= −

∂ ln hβ

∂q

.

For simplicity we now assume that X = X( ˙q). Then from (157) we ﬁnd X as

which must satisﬁes the equation (3). The dynamical system takes the form

X =(cid:18) ∂2

∂ ˙q2(cid:19)−1(cid:18) Q
F(cid:19) ,

¨q +

∂ ln hβ

∂q

= 0.

2. Example 2: Q = f ( ˙q)eβqn

In our second example, the conserved quantity Q is again given. For example it has the form

where f is a funstion of ˙q. From (154) we obtain

Q = f ( ˙q)eβqn

,

Then from (157) we ﬁnd X as

F = F (q, ˙q) = −

βnqn−1 ˙qf

f ′

.

F(cid:19) ,
X = L−1(cid:18) Q

which must satisﬁes the equation (3). The dynamical system takes the form

In particular, if n = 1 then

¨q +

βnqn−1 ˙q

f ′( ˙q)

= 0.

¨q +

β ˙qf
f ′( ˙q)

= 0.

(143)

(144)

(145)

(146)

(147)

(148)

(149)

3. Example 3: Q = s(t) + f ( ˙q)h(q)

In our second example, the conserved quantity Q is again given. For example it has the form

where s, h and f are funstions of t, q and ˙q, respectively. Eq.(154) gives

Q = Q(t, q, ˙q) = s(t) + f ( ˙q)h(q),

Then the dynamical system takes the form

F = F (t, q, ˙q) = −

˙s + ˙qf h′

hf ′

.

¨q +

˙s + ˙qf h′

hf ′ = 0.

B. The two-dimensional case

We now consider the two-dimensional dynamical system which we write as

¨q1 + F1 = 0,
¨q2 + F2 = 0.

The conserved quantity satisﬁes the equation

0 =

dQ
dt

=

∂Q
∂t

∂Q
∂q1

+ ˙q2

∂Q
∂q2

∂Q
∂ ˙q2

.

We now assume that, for intance, F1 is given. Then F2 has the form

F2 = −

∂Q
∂t + ˙q1

∂Q
∂q1

∂Q
∂q2

+ F1

∂Q
∂ ˙q1

+ ˙q2
∂Q
∂ ˙q2

As an example, let us consider the following some generalized two-dimensional harmonic oscillator

where

¨q1 = F1,
¨q2 = F2,

F1 = ( ˙q2 − ω2)q1

and F2 is unknown. Let the conserved quantity Q is given and has the form

Q = f (q1)g(q2)h( ˙q1)z( ˙q2).

We ﬁnd F2 we use Eq.(156). We obtain

In particular case, when

F2 = −

f z′ −

gz′ −

( ˙q2 − ω2)q1z

f = 6q2

g = h = 0,

z = ˙q2

the quantities F2 and Q take the forms given in Eq.(166) and (22), respectively.

C. The three-dimensional case

We now consider the three-dimensional dynamical system (harmonic oscillator) which we write as

16

where

¨q1 − F1 = 0,
¨q2 − F2 = 0,
¨q3 − F3 = 0,

F1 = ( ˙q2 − ω2)q1, F2 = −

2 ˙q1 ˙q2

q1

and F3 is unknown. To ﬁnd F3 we use the formula

F3 = −

∂Q

∂Q
∂q2
∂Q

Q = 6q2

1 ˙q3 = const.

F3 = −

VII. RELATION BETWEEN THE HOJMAN SYMMETRY AND INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS

The main aim of the Hojman symmetry is to ﬁnd the conserved quatities for some dynamical systems.
Some of such dynamical systems are nonlinear and integrable. As well-known such integrable nonlinear
dynamical systems admit the inﬁnite number integrals of motions. It is interesting to study the relation
between the Hojman conserved quatities and integrals of motion of integrable dynamical systems. This
is a question that we are going to consider in this subsection.

A. The one-dimensional case

As an example of integrable dynamical systems we consider the Painleve - I equation. Its equation

reads as

where

¨q = F,

F = 6q2 + t.

In our case

so that the conserved quantity is given by

R =

(175)

(176)

(177)

(178)

Thus we reached to our aim which was to establish the statement of the problem about the relation
between the Hojman symmetry and integrable one-dimensional nonlinear systems.

B. The two-dimensional case

As an example of integrable dynamical systems we consider the Painleve - I equation. Its equation

reads as

where F2 is unknown and

The unknown force F2 we ﬁnd as

¨q2 = F2,

VIII. SOME GENERALIZATIONS OF THE HOJMAN CONSERVED THEOREM

In the above we have considered the Hojman symmetry for some FRW cosmological gas models. The
equations of motion of these models were second order diﬀerential equations of the form (1). However,
in some cases the equations of physical systems can be given by diﬀerential equations of the order higher
than the second order (see e.g. Refs. [15]-[? ]). In this section we try to generalize the Hojman symmetry
for the third-order and fourth-order diﬀerential equations.

A. The third-order diﬀerential equation

Let the equations of motion of the physical system be given as

...
q i = Fi (t, qj, ˙qj, ¨qj) ,

(187)

where i, j = 1, . . . , N , the dot stands for a derivative with respect to time t and Fi is the ”force”. Below
we consider Problem A and Problem B.

1. Problem A

We start from Problem A. Let qi and ˜q i be solutions of the same equations (97) (up to ǫ2 terms). As
in (1), here we again assume that these solutions are related by the following inﬁnitesimal transformation

where Xi is a symmetry vector for Eq. (97). In our case Xi satisﬁes the following set of third order linear
equations

˜q i = qi + ǫXi (t, qj, ˙qj, ¨qj) ,

(188)

where

d3Xi
dt3 −

∂Fi

dt

=

∂
∂t

+ ˙qi

∂
∂qi

+ ¨qi

∂
∂ ˙qi

+ Fi

∂
∂ ¨qi

.

Let the ”force” Fi satisfy the equation (in some coordinate systems)

∂Fi
∂ ¨qi

= 0 .

Then the quantity

Q =

∂Xi
∂qi

+

∂

∂ ˙qi (cid:18) dXi

dt (cid:19) +

∂

∂ ¨qi (cid:18) d2Xi
dt2 (cid:19)

obeys the equation dQ/dt = 0 that is a conserved quantity for Eq.(97).

2. Problem B

Now let us consider Problem B. We assume that the conserved quantity is given as

Q = αq1 ¨q3
1

(189)

(190)

(191)

(192)

(193)

To ﬁnd F1 we use the following formula

As result we obtain

F1 = −

∂Q
∂t + ˙q1

+ ¨q1

∂Q
∂ ˙q1

.

∂Q
∂q1
∂Q
∂ ¨q1

F1 = −

˙q1 ¨q1
3q1

.

Thus the third-order diﬀerential equation takes the form

...
q 1 +

˙q1 ¨q1
3q1

= 0.

It admits the conserved quantity given by the equation (203).

19

(194)

(195)

(196)

B. The fourth-order diﬀerential equation

Our next example is the fourth order diﬀerential equations which are also the equations of motion of

some physical system.

We write the fourth order diﬀerential equations as

1. Problem A

....
q i = Fi (t, qj, ˙qj, ¨qj,

...
q j) .

(197)

Again let qi and ˜q i are solutions of this equation (up to ǫ2 terms). They are related by the following
inﬁnitesimal transformation

We now assume that Xi satisﬁes the following set of fourth order linear equations

˜q i = qi + ǫXi (t, qj, ˙qj, ¨qj,

...
q j) .

where

d4Xi
dt4 −

∂Fi

+ Fi

∂
...
q i

∂

.

Also we assume that the ”force” Fi satisﬁes the equation

∂Fi
...
q i
∂

= 0.

Then the conserved quantity for the Hojman symmetry has the form

Q =

∂Xi
∂qi

so that dQ/dt = 0.

∂

(198)

(199)

(200)

(201)

(202)

2. Problem B

20

Consider Problem B. We again assume that the conserved quantity is given and, for instance, has the

form

To ﬁnd F1 we use the following formula

Q = αq1 ˙q1

...
q 2
1

Finally we obtain

∂Q
∂t + ˙q1

∂Q
∂q1

F1 = −

∂Q
∂ ˙q1

...
q 1

∂Q

∂Q
...q 1
∂

F1 = −

( ˙q2

.

Thus the thourth-order diﬀerential equation has the form

....
q 1 +

˙q1 ¨q1
3q1

= 0.

with the conserved quantity given by the equation (217).

C. The Nth-order diﬀerential equations

The previous approach we can extend to the Nth-order diﬀerential equations of the form

(203)

(204)

(205)

(206)

(207)

qi(N ) = Fi(cid:16)t, qj , ˙qj, ¨qj,

q j, ..., qi(N −1)(cid:17) .

...

where qi(N ) is the N th derivative of qi with the respect of t. As above, let qi and ˜qi are solutions of this
equation (up to ǫ2 terms). They are related by the following inﬁnitesimal transformation

We now assume that Xi satisﬁes the following set of fourth order linear equations

˜qi = qi + ǫXi(cid:16)t, qj, ˙qj, ¨qj,

q j, ..., qi(N −1)(cid:17) .

D. Nojman symmetry for the symmetry vectors equations: X - equations

Let us return for example to the equations of the symmetry vectors (3). Our aim here is to try construct
the Nojman symmetry for these symmetry vectors equations. To do that we rewrite the X - equations
(3) in the following ”canonical” form

¨Xi = Gi(t, qj, ˙qj, Xj,

˙Xj),

(213)

where Gi is a ”force” for Xi and qi is a solutions of the equation (1). We now assume that two solutions
of the X - equations (122) are related by the following inﬁnitesimal transformation

˜X i = Xi + ǫYi(cid:16)t, qj, ˙qj, Xj,

˙Xj(cid:17) ,

˙Xj(cid:17) is a symmetry vector for Eq.(122). It satisﬁes the following set of second

(215)

(216)

(217)

(219)

where Yi = Yi(cid:16)t, qj, ˙qj, Xj,

Let the ”force” Gi satisfy the equation (in some coordinate systems)

Then the quantity

obeys the equation

R =

∂Xi

+

∂

dt (cid:19)
∂ ˙Xi (cid:18) dYi

dR/dt = 0

that is a conserved quantity for Eq.(122). Note that there exists one generalization of the last three
equations.
Instead of the equation (126), let the ”force” Gi satisfy (in some coordinate systems) the
generalized equation

∂Gi
∂ ˙Xi

d

= −

ln γ .

Here we assume that γ = γ(Xi) is a function of Xi. In this case, the quantity R takes the form

¨Xi = Gi(t, qj , ˙qj, Xj,

˙Xj),
˙Xj),

22

(224)

(225)

where Fi and Gi are ”forces” for qi and Xi, respectively. We now assume that two solutions of these
equations are related by the following inﬁnitesimal transformation

˜q i = qi + ǫXi(t, qj, ˙qj, Xj,
˜X i = Xi + ǫYi(t, qj, ˙qj, Xj,

They satisfy the following set of second-order linear equations [6]

IX. CONCLUSIONS

23

The accelerated expansion of the universe is one of prime problems in modern cosmology. To explain
this phenomena there exist various candidates - cosmological models arising from the standard General
Relativity and its diﬀerent modiﬁcations such as F (R) gravity, F (T ) gravity and so on. Such a large
number of models raised the question of choosing among them the most realistic models. In this way,
symmetry plays a crucial role to choose fundamental cosmological models. In this context, the Hojman
symmetry approach can be a useful tool to ﬁnd out such models and to construct some class of exact
solutions of cosmological models if suitable Hojman vectors are identiﬁed. In this paper, we studied some
cosmological models using the Hojman symmetry. As the examples we considered Chaplygin gases and
the van der Waalls models describing the universe and found the corresponding conserved quantities.

Originally, the Hojman symmetry was proposed for the second-order dynamical systems. However, as
we mentioned in the Introduction, in some cases the equations of motion of physical systems have the order
higher than two. Regarding it, we have extended the standard Hojman symmetry formalism to the third-
order and fourth-order diﬀerential equations. In particular, we have derived Hojman conservation laws
for these two cases. These are important results as unlike the diﬃculty of considering this second order
symmetry in some gravity theories [9], now it might be possible to apply the fourth-order generalization
of the Hojman symmetry to f (R) modiﬁed gravity in the metric formalism since its equations of motion
are also of the fourth-order. However, it seems that the real role of the Hojman symmetry in cosmology
is still an open question and require further investigations. Another open problem is to understand the
relations between the Hojman symmetry with other symmetries like Noether and Lie symmetries.
