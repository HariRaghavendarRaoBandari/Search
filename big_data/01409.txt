We study the synchronization of a van der Pol self-oscillator with Kerr anharmonicity to an external drive.
We demonstrate that the anharmonic, discrete energy spectrum of the quantum oscillator leads to multiple
resonances in both phase locking and frequency entrainment not present in the corresponding classical system.
Strong driving close to these resonances leads to nonclassical steady-state Wigner distributions. Experimental
realizations of these genuine quantum signatures can be implemented with current technology.

Synchronization of self-oscillators is a subject with great
relevance to several natural sciences [1, 2]. Its exciting fron-
tiers include neuronal synchronization in the human brain
[3, 4], stabilization of power-grid networks [5], as well as
the engineering of high-precision clocks [6, 7]. Recent ad-
vances in nanotechnology will enable experiments with large
arrays of self-oscillators in the near future [8, 9]. Whereas
most research has focused on the classical domain, synchro-
nization in the quantum regime [10] has become a very ac-
tive topic. There has been much recent experimental progress
with micro- and nanomechanical systems [11–15], and theo-
retical proposals for mesoscopic ensembles of atoms [16–18],
lasers [19], cavity optomechanics [20–23], trapped ions [24–
26], arrays of coupled nonlinear cavities [27], and interacting
quantum dipoles [28]. In addition, there are open conceptual
questions on the relation of synchronization to entanglement
or mutual information [29, 30].

Studying a van der Pol oscillator, the most prominent exam-
ple of a self-oscillator, recent theoretical work characterized
how synchronization quantitatively diﬀers between its quan-
tum and classical realization in phase locking [24, 25] as well
as in frequency entrainment [21, 22]. While synchronization
is hindered by quantum noise compared to the classical model
[21, 22], noise is less detrimental [24, 25] than one would ex-
pect from a semiclassical description.

In this article we study self-oscillators for which both the
damping and the frequency is amplitude-dependent. We show
that their synchronization behavior is qualitatively diﬀerent in
the quantum and the classical regime. Focusing on a van der
Pol oscillator with Kerr anharmonicity, we ﬁnd two genuine
quantum signatures. First, while synchronization of one such
oscillator to an external drive is maximal at one particular fre-
quency classically, the corresponding quantum system shows
a tendency to synchronize at multiple frequencies. Using per-
turbation theory in the drive strength, we demonstrate that
these multiple resonances reﬂect the quantized anharmonic
energy spectrum of the oscillator. We show that these features
are observable in the phase probability distribution if the Kerr
anharmonicity is large compared to the relaxation rates and
the system is in the quantum regime, i.e. the limit cycle ampli-
tudes are small. In the semiclassical limit the energy spectrum
becomes continuous, so that the resonances (and therefore the
quantized energy spectrum) cannot be resolved. Using numer-

In this ﬁgure the coherent drive (green arrows) is resonant with the
transition between the states |1(cid:105) and |2(cid:105). The wiggly lines denote two
incoherent processes: linear (one-phonon) anti-damping with rate γ1
(red arrows) and nonlinear (two-phonon) damping with rate γ2 (blue
arrows).

tude A. In the limit of large amplitude A, the radial Wigner density
W(A) is a Gaussian with variance σ2
= 3/8 around the zero of Γ,
A
i.e. Γ(A) = 0.

ically exact simulations of the full quantum master equation,
we ﬁnd a second genuine quantum signature: for strong driv-
ing close to these resonances the steady-state Wigner distribu-
tion exhibits areas of negative density, i.e., the steady state is
nonclassical.

Model.– We consider an anharmonic self-oscillator subject
to an external drive. For concreteness, we will focus on a van
der Pol self-oscillator with Kerr anharmonicity, but the results
we present are generic and can be generalized to other anhar-
monic self-oscillators. In the rotating frame of the drive our
model system is described by the quantum master equation

˙ρ = −i[H0 + H1, ρ] + Lρ,

(1)
with Hamiltonian H0 = −∆a†a + K(a†a)2, drive Hamiltonian
2 D[a†]ρ +
H1 = iE(a − a†), and Lindblad operator Lρ = γ1
2 D[a2]ρ, where a denotes the annihilation operator for the
oscillator and D[x]ρ = 2xρx† − (x†xρ − ρx†x). The Hamilto-
nian H0 describes a Kerr oscillator with anharmonic spectrum
characterized by the Kerr parameter K > 0, see Fig. 1 (a). The

γ2

coherent drive has amplitude E and frequency ωd that is de-
tuned from the (harmonic) frequency of the oscillator ωm by
∆ = ωd − ωm. The oscillator is also subject to two incoher-
ent processes described by the Lindblad operator L, i.e. linear
(one-phonon) anti-damping with rate γ1 and nonlinear (two-
photon) damping with rate γ2.

Phase space description and semiclassical model.– Fully
equivalent to the quantum master equation (1), the system can
be described by a partial diﬀerential equation ∂tW(α, α∗, t) =
ΛW(α, α∗, t) for the Wigner distribution W [31, 32] with

Both the Kerr anharmonicity K and the van der Pol nonlin-
earity γ2 lead to third-order derivatives in α that are necessary
for nonclassical steady-state Wigner densities [33]. Indeed,
for the van der Pol term γ2 the third-order derivative is ac-
companied with a diﬀusion term limiting the genuine quantum
behavior, whereas the Kerr term K gives us the opportunity to
increase ‘quantumness’ without adding diﬀusion.
In the limit of large limit-cycle amplitudes |α|, i.e. γ1 (cid:29) γ2,
we can neglect the third-order derivatives [24, 34, 35] and get

that contains only ﬁrst- and second-order derivatives corre-
sponding to drift and diﬀusion, respectively. As illustrated in
Fig. 1 (b), the drift term consists of an amplitude-dependent
damping rate Γ = −γ1 + 2γ2(|α|2− 1), an amplitude-dependent
oscillation frequency Ω = −∆ + 2K(|α|2 − 1) in the frame of
the drive, and the drive of strength E. The diﬀusion is given
by D = γ1

2 (2|α|2 − 1).

A0 = (cid:112)

In the absence of driving E = 0 and using polar coordinates
α = Aeiφ, the dynamics of the amplitude A decouples from
the dynamics of the phase φ in Eq. (3). Within a Gaussian
approximation similar to Refs. [36, 37] we solve for the ra-
dial steady-state distribution W(A) and ﬁnd a mean amplitude
1 + γ1/2γ2 for which Γ(A0) = 0. For A (cid:29) 1 we obtain
a variance σ2
8 so that the relative deviation σA/A0 is neg-
A
ligible and we can approximate the amplitude-dependent dif-
fusion constant with its value at A0, i.e. D ≈ (3γ1 +2γ2)/4 > 0.
In this case, Λc is a Fokker-Planck-operator describing a clas-
sical process. The oscillation frequency Ω is sensitive to ﬂuc-
tuations in the amplitude A, i.e. σΩ ∝ KA0 ≈ K
γ1/2γ2.
Therefore, classically, the range of detuning ∆ for which phase
locking and frequency entrainment occur becomes larger with
increasing K and A0, as we shall also see in Figs. 3 (b) and (f).
Analytical treatment.– To gain some analytical understand-
ing, we use perturbation theory [38] to approximate the steady
state of the quantum master equation (1) in the limit of weak
drive strength and large Kerr anharmonicity E (cid:28) γ1+γ2 (cid:28) K.

is its Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

In analogy to standard perturbation theory for Hamiltonians,
we decompose the quantum master equation ˙ρ = (L0 + L1) ρ
in Eq. (1) into an unperturbed operator L0 and a perturbation
L1 with L0 ρ = Lρ − i[H0, ρ] and L1 ρ = −i[H1, ρ]. The ﬁrst-
order correction to the steady state is ρ(1) = −L−1
0 L1ρ(0) where
ρ(0) is the steady state of the unperturbed Liouvillian L0 and
L−1
0
The unperturbed steady-state ρ(0) can be found analytically:
nn = rnΦ(1+n, r+n, r)/[(r)nΦ(1, r, 2r)] where (·)n denotes the
ρ(0)
Pochhammer symbol, Φ is Kummer’s conﬂuent hypergeomet-
ric function, and r = γ1/γ2 [39]. We see that ρ(0) is diagonal in
the number basis describing limit cycles without any preferred
phase, i.e. their Wigner density is rotationally symmetric, and
it depends only on the ratio of relaxation rates γ1/γ2 and not
the Kerr parameter K. In the limit of large r, corresponding to
large mean amplitude, the ρ(0)
nn follow a Gaussian distribution
with mean (cid:104)n(cid:105) = r/2 and variance ∆2n = 3r/4. This is consis-
tent with the large-amplitude semiclassical treatment above,
as both mean (cid:104)n(cid:105) ≈ A2
A agree.
In the opposite limit r → 0, the steady state is approximately
ρ(0) → 2
Next, we exploit the fact that the superoperator L0 can be
decomposed into a term coupling diagonal density matrix el-
ements and a term coupling oﬀ-diagonal elements separately.
Neglecting terms of order γ1/K and γ2/K, we obtain the in-
verse L−1
in the oﬀ-diagonal subspace by inverting its diago-
nal so that L−1

The anharmonic quantum energy levels of the Kerr oscilla-
tor shown in Fig. 1 (a) lead to multiple resonances in the
ﬁrst-order response to an external drive. In the following we
will discuss the consequences of these resonances in terms of
phase locking and frequency entrainment.

Phase locking.– It is well-known that there is not a unique
way to deﬁne the phase operator in quantum mechanics [40].
One option [41] that has been used to study quantum synchro-
2π(cid:104)φ|ρ|φ(cid:105) with
nization [26] is the phase distribution P(φ) = 1
m(cid:44)n=0 ρm,neiφ(n−m).
Our perturbative steady-state solution (6) contains only terms
with n − m = ±1, so P(φ) = 1
+ η1 cos φ + η2 sin φ with
2π
m=0 Re[ρm+1,m] and η2 = 1
η1 = 1
To convert the phase distribution P(φ) into a single number
characterizing the tendency to synchronize, we use the abso-

m=0 Im[ρm+1,m].

Figure 3. Global behavior of the phase-locking measure S for the
steady state of Λ (a, c, e) and Λc (b, d, f). In (a) and (b) S is plotted
as a function of ∆ and γ2 for E = 2.25γ1 and K = 50γ1, in (c) and (d)
as a function of ∆ and E for γ2 = 5γ1 and K = 50γ1, and in (e) and (f)
as a function of ∆ and K for γ2 = 5γ1, E = 2.25γ1, and Kmax = 50γ1.

ﬁnd that the position of the resonances is very well described
by Eq. (8) (red bold dotted line). In contrast, the semi-classical
model deﬁned by Eq. (3) would lead to a single, broad reso-
nance (blue dashed line). Figures 2 (b)-(d) show how phase
locking at the two maxima and the one minimum manifests in
the steady-state Wigner distribution W(α, α∗).

Figure 3 (a) illustrates how more resonances at ∆ = K(2m +
1) appear with decreasing γ2/γ1, as more Fock levels become
populated, while each individual resonance becomes weaker.
The semiclassical approximation depicted in Fig. 3 (b) shows
broadening, but there is one smeared-out resonance, as the en-
ergy distribution is continuous classically. Figure 3 (c) shows
the synchronization tongue, i.e. the synchronization measure
as a function of detuning ∆ for increasing drive E. The ra-
tio γ2/γ1 is chosen such that three Fock levels have a non-
negligible population in steady state resulting in the two res-
onances for the full quantum description. As expected classi-
cally, the tongue is not split in Fig. 3 (d) showing the solution
for Λc. Finally, Figures 3 (e) and (f) illustrate that in the ab-
sence of a Kerr anharmonicity, K = 0, there is only one reso-
nance as all energy gaps are identical for harmonic oscillators.
For increasing K the resonance splits in the quantum system
Fig. 3 (e), while the classical resonance Fig. 3 (f) broadens.

to discuss the frequency entrainment [22]. In Fig. 4 (a) we
demonstrate that for a nonzero Kerr anharmonicity K (cid:44) 0
the frequency entrainment shows resonances at detunings ∆ =
(2n+1)K, similar to the resonances in phase locking discussed
in the previous paragraph. For the parameters of Fig. 4 the
drive is so strong that the dynamics goes beyond ﬁrst-order
perturbation theory and also diagonal matrix elements of the
density matrix in steady state are changed. As shown in the
inset of Fig. 4 (b), for the detuning at the ∆ = 5K resonance
the redistribution is from even to odd Fock states, which have

and corresponding Wigner distributions. The phase locking behavior
for the quantum system (black solid line) described by Λ (deﬁned
in Eq. (2)) can be understood with our perturbative expression (8)
(red bold dotted line). For the parameters of this plot (γ2/γ1 = 7,
E/γ1 = 2.25, K/γ1 = 50) approximately three energy levels have
signiﬁcant occupation, so that two resonances are possible. The blue
dashed line shows the results of the corresponding semi-classical
model Λc (deﬁned in Eq. (3)), for which there is only one resonance
as expected. The Wigner distributions for the parameters at the two
peaks (b), (d) and the minimum (c) illustrate the quantum phase lock-
ing behavior of Λ.

Equation (8) is one of the main results of this Letter. S (ρ(1)) is
a coherent sum of resonances at ∆ = K(2m + 1) and width Γm.
They can be resolved for large Kerr anharmonicity K (cid:29) Γm
deﬁned in Eq. (5). The number of visible resonances depends
on the number of non-negligible probabilities ρ(0)
mm in the un-
perturbed steady state ρ(0). In the quantum limit r → 0, the
resonances become more pronounced since fewer levels are
occupied. In the limit r → ∞, the energy spectrum becomes
continuous, so that the resonances can no longer be resolved.
With this analytical understanding in mind we now present
exact numerical steady-state results of Eq. (1) obtained with
the steady-state solver of QuTiP [42, 43] which we compare
to the semiclassical approximation described by Λc of Eq. (3),
where the steady-state is found by discretizing the Fokker-
Planck equation. In Figs. 2 and 3 the resulting phase-locking
measure S is plotted as a function of the system parameters.
The black solid line in Fig. 2 (a) shows S as a function of the
detuning ∆/K for γ2 = 7γ1, E = 2.25γ1 and K = 50γ1. We

Conclusion.– We have identiﬁed parameter regimes where
synchronization of a quantum anharmonic oscillator is qual-
itatively diﬀerent from that in the corresponding semiclassi-
cal model. We have shown that phase locking is resonantly
enhanced and suppressed due to the quantization of possi-
ble oscillation frequencies, as reﬂected in the extrema of the
synchronization tongue of Fig. 3. This behavior can be un-
derstood with a simple analytical model leading to Eq. (8).
Frequency entrainment can switch from unlocked to nearly
locked behavior at the same resonances as shown in Fig. 4 (a).
A further clear signature of nonclassical dynamics is the neg-
ative density in the steady-state Wigner distribution displayed
in Fig. 4 (b), which is in contrast to similar systems [45]. Pos-
sible experimental realizations include trapped ion setups or
other platforms with strongly anharmonic spectrum. We ex-
pect that the genuine quantum signatures discussed here will
be relevant in studies of synchronization in anharmonic os-
cillator networks or anharmonic oscillators coupled to other
quantum systems such as qubits.

Around ∆ ≈ K and ∆ ≈ 3K the two lines match indicating a reso-
nance in frequency entrainment. At ∆ = 5K the spectrum shows a
third, smaller response. The steady state for these parameters is char-
acterized by a Wigner distribution with negative density, see panel
(b). The inset shows the Fock state probabilities P(n) in the presence
(right blue bars) and absence of the coherent drive (left black bars).

negative Wigner density around the origin α = 0. Accord-
ingly, the steady-state Wigner distribution shows strong neg-
ative density as shown in Fig. 4 (b) and therefore cannot be
described in a semiclassical picture.

This clearly demonstrates that (quantum-induced) diﬀusion
is insuﬃcient to describe the synchronization dynamics of
anharmonic oscillators, since derivatives of higher than sec-
ond order are required to bring about a negative Wigner den-
sity [33] in the phase space formulation of quantum optics.
Here, the higher-order derivatives stem from both the Kerr
and the van der Pol nonlinearity, see Eq. (2).
Interestingly
though, in the case of linear instead of nonlinear damping, the
steady-state Wigner distribution can be calculated analytically
[44, 45] and it is always positive, even for K (cid:44) 0. Similarly,
for van der Pol oscillators without Kerr term, only positive-
valued Wigner densities have been found [22, 24]. These ob-
servations suggest that for harmonic driving only the combi-
nation of a Kerr anharmonicity and a van der Pol nonlinearity
results in a nonclassical steady state.

Experimental implementation.– The driven van der Pol os-
cillator can be implemented with trapped ions, where one-
phonon gain and two-phonon loss can be engineered by driv-
ing diﬀerent sidebands [24]. Also our additional requirement
K (cid:29) Γm is feasible, as trapping potentials with very large an-
harmonicities in position can be realized [46–48] with almost
lossless resonators, e.g. K = 20 kHz in Ref. [47] and typi-
cal heating rates on the order of 100 Hz [49]. For optimized
systems [50, 51] heating rates on the order of Hz have been
reported. We note that a Duﬃng oscillator with anharmonic-
ity χ(a + a†)4 in the Hamiltonian may be approximated by the
corresponding Kerr term for ωm (cid:29) χ(cid:104)a†a(cid:105) using the rotating-
wave approximation. The corresponding Kerr parameter is
then given by K = 6χ. Synchronization can also be studied in
optomechanical systems [11–15], where as a future perspec-
tive strong Kerr anharmonicities may be engineered according
to proposals [52–55].
