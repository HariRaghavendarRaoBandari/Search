Abstract The dynamics of an association of interactive biological species is studied
theoretically. We explore a mean ﬁeld approximation to describe the temporal evo-
lution of an ecological system with the basic prey-predator interspecies relation, as
well as an approximation to introduce time correlations in the dynamics. We start by
discussing the solution of the Volterra-Lotka model in a mean ﬁeld approximation
based in an analogy with the Weiss solution to the Ising model for ferromagnetic ma-
terials. In order to explore the effects of long-range time correlations, we describe the
time evolution of the system within a kind of Bragg-Williams approximation. This
approach allows us to evaluate a characteristic life-time of the ecosystem. This quan-
tity could be very useful to discuss the time evolution of the system under a wide
diversity of environmental conditions of the ecosystem which is not usually consid-
ered. We discuss the general trends of the temporal evolution of the association with
some data from real ecosystems.

1 Introduction

Population dynamics has been a along very long time a fundamental mathematical
problem with strong implications in several ﬁelds of science and technology [1,2,3,
4,5]. Even presently, most of the fundamental aspects of the dynamics of systems of
interacting species are still considered open problems. Since the pioneering works of

Lotka and Volterra [6,7] attempting a description based on a dynamical systems ap-
proach, there have been a large number of proposals trying to describe an ecosystem
in terms of the internal and external variables of the biological associations, namely,
the characteristics of the interactions among the species and the environmental con-
ditions in which they are immersed.

There have been some other breakthrough proposals based on different approaches,

for instance, statistical mechanics approaches [8,9], stochastic and logistic approaches [10,
11], and mean ﬁeld approaches [12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Usually it is assumed that
the biological associations of species are composed by a large number of populations
of multiple different species, where the interactions among them depend on many
biological and physical relations, as well as chemical reactions.

For most of these complex interactions no analytical expression is known. In a
real ecological system, as a result of these complex interactions the associations are
able to organize hierarchically in many ways, but all of them are related to the prim-
itive goals of survival and reproduction in a given environment. In many cases the
environment is the most relevant variable that determines the stability of the ecosys-
tem.

It is usually assumed that the dynamics of the ecosystems could be described in
an heuristic approximation taking into account its size, in terms of the number of
individuals of the species, and the connection between them through complex in-
teractions, usually parametrical introduced. The time evolution of the system under
these conditions generates some time patterns in the ecosystem. One expects that the
knowledge of correlations expressed in the hierarchical structures allows to describe
the time evolution of the ecosystem in terms of the intrinsic relationships among the
species, that express in some way their biological proximity.

In 1959 E. Kerner et al [9] described in an statistical mechanics formalism, the
dynamics of a biological association based on the Volterra-Lotka model. Authors
discuss the equilibrium of the association considering the ensemble theory and deter-
mine the thermodynamic quantities as a function of the population. They introduce
the concept of eco-temperature which permit to calculate, free energy and heat ca-
pacity in terms of the population of the species. In this way they discuss the charac-
teristics of the steady states of the association.

In this report we focus our attention in an aspect of the dynamics of a biological
association of species which usually is not addressed, this is the role of time correla-
tions on the stability and dynamics of a close to equilibrium association of biological
species. By using the analogous number of coordination, we found the dynamical
evolution of the ecological lattice as a function of the ecological coordination num-
ber and the number os species involved on the lattice.

To this end, we developed a mean ﬁeld approximation based on a lattice model
approach, and additionally propose and approximation to consider the effects of long
range time correlations. In the next section, we brieﬂy review the essentials of the
Ising lattice model, and introduce the lattice model to describe the biological associa-
tion. A mean ﬁeld approximation based on an analogy with the Weiss approximation
to solve the Ising Hamiltonian for ferromagnetic systems is discussed in section 3.
To explore the effect of long range time correlations, in section 4 an approximation

based in an analogy with the Bragg-Williams is presented. Finally we make some
remarks and comments.

2 Ising model

We present here a mean ﬁeld model to describe the dynamics of a biological asso-
ciation with predator-prey interactions. We developed this lattice model taking ad-
vantage of the analogy between the mathematical expression of Issing Hamiltonian
for ferromagnetic materials [19], with the rate equations which describe the time
evolution of the populations of a biological association in the Volterra and Lotka
model [20].

Our lattice model allow us to describe a biological association focussing our at-
tention in a particular pair of species immersed in an environment composed by the
other species. In other words, this approach allows us to collapse an association of
biological species into a system formed by only three, where a pair of them are close
biologically-wise, with a predator-prey interaction, and the third one varies slowly in
time.

There exist a wide variety of systems whose dynamics can be addressed by using
a lattice model approach. Mean ﬁeld approximation can be used to study the dynam-
ics of a wide variety of interesting complex systems, such as: the behavior of social
organization in a war [21,22], neural networks [23], and merging collective phe-
nomena induced by local cellular automata [24]. In the ecological case, the complex
interaction of competition, cooperation or predation can be introduced by heuristic
and phenomenological parameters that describe the rate of chance of the populations
due to different interactions.

In the Ising model, named after Ernst Ising presented it in 1925, ﬁrst suggested
by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920 [25], each molecule in a lattice has a magnetic moment
that can be oriented either up or down relative to the direction of an external applied
ﬁeld. Under these conditions the Ising hamiltonian include two terms, one of them
considers the interaction of each magnetic moment with the external ﬁeld, and the
second includes the interaction at a given neighbor range. In this way the Hamiltonian
is given by

s i − J

N(cid:229)

i

g

j

s

js i,

(1)

N(cid:229)
where B is an external magnetic ﬁeld, m

HI = −m B

i

is the magnetic moment of the molecules,
N is the total number of molecules, s i (or s i)=+1 or an ”up” spin and -1 for a ”down”
spin, and g represents the coordination number, i.e. the number nearest neighbors in
a given site. The geometrical aspects of the distribution of dipoles of the system are
contained in this parameter.

Finally, J stands for the exchange interaction [19,25,26]. Once introduced the
Ising model, by taking into account the geometrical characteristics of a given lattice,
the Hamiltonian can be cast into a form that incorporates these in the following form.
In the Ising model for a given conﬁguration of the lattice, it is deﬁned N+ as the
total number of sites of the lattice with spin-up magnetic moment, and N− as the total

(cid:229)
4

number of spin-down sites. Considering only the nearest neighbors, the couples that
can be formed from the spins can be only of three types (+,+), (-,-) and (+,-). The
relations that describe the exchange between the sites (+) and (-) are

g N+ = 2N++ + N+−,
g N− = 2N−− + N+−,

N = N+ + N−.

By using these relations, the Ising hamiltonian can be cast into
HI = −J(N++ + N−− − N+−) − m B(N+ − N−,
HI = −4JN++ + 2(g J − m B)N+ + (m B − g J/2)N,

(2)

(3)

whose solution in terms of the number of pairs (+,+), (+,-) and (-,-) has been
extensively discussed [19,26]. In 1907 Pierre Weiss proposed an approximation to
solve the Ising model. By considering that the energy of an individual atom in a
given conﬁguration of the system, is determined by the average energy rather than by
the ﬂuctuating value of the neighboring atoms, he proposed to replace the sum over
the nearest neighbors by its mean value. It means that the Hamiltonian given by the
equation (1) can be written as

H = −

N(cid:229)

i

m iz(Bz + Bmol),

(4)

where Bmol = J (cid:229)

jz. Thus, by means of the Weiss approximation, the many
magnetic moment system has been cast into a system formed by independent mag-
netic moment under the inﬂuence of the total ﬁeld,

m

g
i

H = −

N(cid:229)

i

(Btot )m iz.

(5)

Btot = Bz +Bmol qualitatively describes well the ferromagnetic-paramagnetictran-
sition, however, it fails in predicting the scaling behavior of the physical quantities in
the critical region. The physical reason of this fail is that the mean ﬁeld approximation
does disregard ﬂuctuations in the system.

2.1 The ecosystem lattice model

We construct our lattice model for the biological association by developing expres-
sions analogous to relations (2) for a prey-predator system. It is convenient to remark
here the analogy between the mathematical structure of the Ising model Hamilto-
nian and the equations of the Lotka-Volterra model. We recall that the description
of the time evolution of the populations in an association of biological species in a
traditional rate equations framework is based on expressions with the form [27],

dPi(t)

dt

= Fi(p1(t), p2(t), ..., pi(t)),

(6)

Bragg-Williams approximation for the dynamics of prey-predator biological associations

where Fi is in general, some nonlinear function of the populations pi, of the i-th
species. In this framework, one of the ﬁrst models to analyze the dynamics of interac-
tive biological species by joining the scheme developed by Vito Volterra [28,29,30]
and that proposed by Alfred J. Lotka [31,32,33], in order to describe autocatalytic
reactions.

The Lotka-Volterra model (LVM) describes time evolution of the biological as-
sociation based on a set of non linear rate equations. This model predicts a cyclic
behavior of the populations of a given number of species. It has been considered that
this is a kind of primitive model of a biological association.

Depending on the initial conditions, these equations describe a whole family of
curves in the phase space. The LVM initially proposed to describe a couple of species,
has been generalized to describe g -species, becoming the corresponding equations in
the form

dNi
dt

= ±

g

i

e iNi + b −1

jiNjNi.

(7)

Where the parameters e i are the rates of growth of the i-th specie, which can be
can be positive or negative depending of the role of that specie. If e i>0 the i-th popu-
lation grows following the Malthus law [34] and if e i<0, and Nj=0 the population of
the i-th specie decays exponentially.

The binary encounters between individuals of the populations i-th and j-th is the
quadratic term given by NiNj and its effect is governed by the coefﬁcients a
ji which
deﬁne the rate at which Ni increases or decreases due to the encounter with the other
specie. When the encounters between the members of the species i and j occur, they
lead to the situation where one of the species wins and the other looses. It means
that a i j=−a
ji. Coefﬁcient b i is the so called Volterra’s number or equivalence of the
ratio of i’s losers (or gainers) per unit time to j’s gainers (or losers) expressed as
b −1
i /b −1

2.2 Lattice model for a prey-predator system

Our lattice model for a biological association is constructed taking advantage of the
mathematical structural similarity between the rate equations of the LVM with the
Ising Hamiltonian.

We assume that the dynamics of the total population is governed by the interac-
tions preys-predators populations, where the prey and predator population is labeled
by Np and Nd respectively. Of course in this simpliﬁed approximation, aspects like
sex and age are disregarded to construct the basic equations of the model. At a given
time the expressions analogous to equations (2) for biological association of species
of a given role, i.e. prey or predator, can be expressed for prey role,

g Np = x pNpNp − (1 − f )NpNd = g Np = x pNpNp − l 1NpNd =

g Np = x pNpp − l 1Npd,

(8)

and for the predator case,

(cid:229)
(cid:229)
6

E.M. De la Calleja1, J.L.Carrillo2, and I. Santamar´ıa-Holek3

g Nd = x dNdNd + (1 − f )n NdNp = g Nd = x dNdNd + l 2n NdNp =

g Nd = x dNdd + l 2n Nd p,

(9)

taking into account that the total population is the sum of preys and predators

populations as,

NT = Nd + Np.

(10)
The g parameter is in the ecological association the analogous to the coordination
number, and is a measure of the biological neighborhood. x i is the parameter that
describes the encounters by pairs or groups at a given role of species, i.e. prey (p) or
predator (d).

l i with i = 1,2 is related to the fraction of prey caught per predator per unit time,
it means, the hunting efﬁciency of the predator and the ability of the prey to scape.
If f = 1 in the interval [0,1] it implies that there are not ideal encounters between
a prey and a predator that favoring the predators. If f =0 the encounters of species
is ideal, and decrease the number of preys, because it indicates that the prey was
successfully hunted by the predator. In some way, the preys eaten are converted in
newborn predators, n represents the conversion factor.

The temporal evolution of the biological association for g species can be ex-

pressed in a form analogous to equation (7) in an expanded form as,

dNT
dt

=

g

i

([e pNp + e dNd] +

[a ppNpNp + a ddNdNd − 2a pdNpNd]).

(11)

According to relations (8),(9) and (10) we can obtain each term of the equation

(11) in terms of the number of preys using the next relations,

Equations (13) and (14) represents the temporal evolution of the total population
taking into account g species, and its mathematical form is similar to equation (1) for
the ferromagnetic system.

3 Mean ﬁeld approximation

The similarity between the mathematical structure of the Lotka-Volterra equation for
total population of an association of biological species (equation 7), with the Ising
model established by equation (4), suggests the possibility of constructing a mean
ﬁeld approximation, analogous to equation (5), to describe the evolution of the total
population of the biological association by mean ﬁeld theory. The rate equation for
the total population may be written in the form,

dNT
dt

=

(15)

the sum is in the subindex < i j > is over the nearest-neighbors. One may deﬁne

a mean ﬁeld parameter for the i-th-specie in the form

Te f fi =

g

j

a

jiNj.

(16)

Considering only the prey-predator relationship, it is possible to deﬁne a mean
ﬁeld parameter for the total number of species. This parameter would include the
interaction between nearest-neighbors for the i-th specie. The temporal evolution of
the the total population in terms of the effective parameter would be given by,

dNi
dt

=

N(cid:229)

i

[e i + b −1

i Te f fi]Ni.

(17)

By considering the deﬁnition of the mean ﬁeld term, for the i-th specie we have,

Tcmi = e i + b −1

i Te f fi .

(18)

In terms of the above deﬁnition, the rate equation for the total population in the

biological association adopts the form,

= (cid:229)

dNT

Tcmi Ni.

(cid:229)
(cid:229)

8

E.M. De la Calleja1, J.L.Carrillo2, and I. Santamar´ıa-Holek3

The above procedure, allow us to express equation (16) for the two speciﬁc roles,

it means in terms of Nd and Np parameters, therefore can it be written as,

Te f f p = a d pNd + a ppNp,
Te f fd = a pdNp + a ddNd.

(20)

By using the relations (8), (9) and (10) we obtain just equation (13) or (14).

3.1 Weiss approximation

As far as now we have deﬁned a lattice model for the biological association, the
parameter g
represents the biological proximity, in analogy with the coordination
number in the Ising model. In a real ecosystem not all the species interact among
them simultaneously, thus, one might think that even though they share a common
territory, some species are not noticed by others. Taking k species that interact each
other by the prey-predator relation, the biological proximity represented by the g
parameter allows to assume that

a

N(cid:229)

a

k(cid:229)

,

(21)

with k < N. By using the deﬁnition of the parameters e e f fi and e cmi, the rate
equations which describes the temporal evolution of the i-th specie and the temporal
evolution of the total population of the association can be cast into

= [e i +

(23)

By introducing a mean ﬁeld parameter for the i species, and the mean ﬁeld for the

total population one obtains

W T (k) =

i(k) =

k(cid:229)

(

(25)

The temporal evolution of the total population and for the i-th population are then

given by

dNT /dt ="e + W T (k)#NT (t),
dNi/dt ="e i + W
i(t)#Ni(t).

(26)

Bragg-Williams approximation for the dynamics of prey-predator biological associations

By integrating (26) one obtains the expression or NT as,

NT (t) = NT (t0)" exp[e + W T (k)]#(t − t0),
i(k)]#(t − t0).
Ni(t) = Ni(t0)" exp[e i + W

In this way, with (t − t0)

lnNT (t) = lnNT (t0)"(e + W T (k))D t#,
i(k))D t#.
lnNi(t) = lnNi(t0)"(e i + W

(27)

Assuming that D t is a small quantity compared with the total time of observation,

we obtain the following expressions for the total and i − thspecie mean ﬁelds.

3.2 Long range correlations

Following the pioneering work of Gorsky [35] about the order-disorder transition
in binary alloys, Bragg-Williams (1934-1935) [36,37,38] introduced the concept of
long-range correlation. The idea of the Bragg-Williams approximation is that the
energy of a single atom in a given system is rather determined by the average order
degree prevalent for the total system than by the ﬂuctuation in the local conﬁguration
of the atoms.

It has been discussed that the approximation formulated by Gorsky and the formu-
lated by Bragg and Williams are physically equivalent [39]. Behind this approxima-
tion also lays the origin of the mean ﬁeld theory approach developed by Weiss [19].
The Bragg-Williams approximation for the ferromagnetic systems expresses the
Hamiltonian of system in terms of the long-range (L) and the short-range (s ) corre-
lations. In the Ising model the energy of the system depends on the number of sites
with spin up (N+) and pair of nearest-neighbor (N++) (see equation (2)).

The relation N++g N/2 is a measure of the short-range order and gives us the frac-
tion of its nearest-neighbors with spin up. N+/N is a measure of long-range order
that considered the entire lattice of all spins must be up. We follow the same con-
siderations proposed in the Ising model [26], for that we deﬁne the long-range order
in terms of (L) and the short-range order in terms of s
as N+/N=(L + 1)/2 and
N++g N/2 = (s + 1)/2. Of course the numerical value of these correlations always, are in
the range (−1 ≤ L ≤ 1) and (−1 ≤ s ≤ 1).

10

E.M. De la Calleja1, J.L.Carrillo2, and I. Santamar´ıa-Holek3

The Bragg Williams approximation take into account that N+

N++g N/2 , this based
in the assumption that ”there is no short-range order apart from that which follows
from long-range order” [37]. The Ising hamiltonian in terms of Bragg-Williams ap-
proximation in terms of (L) can be expressed in the form

N ≈

3.3 Effects of long time correlations

In order to express the corresponding rate equations for the total population of the
biological association in the Bragg-Williams approximation, it is necessary to intro-
duce the short and long-range correlations into the expressions analogous to the Ising
Hamiltonian, it is done by the following procedure.

with the obvious meaning of Np, Npp and g . By the substitution of these expres-
sions in the rate equation for the total population of the ecosystem. In a ferromagnetic
material the Bragg-Williams Hamiltonian describes the energetic state of the system,
following with our analogy in the case of an biological association the corresponding
Hamiltonian is the rate equation for the total population, in this case larger changes
in NT should be interpreted as stages of high energy (Y
) in the system. Expressing

4 Results and conclusions

Now we explore on the basis of these equations, the inﬂuence of the long-range time
correlations on the time evolution of total population of the association. In this pro-
cedure we take the coordination ﬁxed values of b p = 0.006456 [20], a pd = 0.05 and

n = 0.05. The other values were determined using relations (8), (9) and (10). For ex-
ample if the interaction between preys does not exit (a pp = 0), it determines that the
encounters, between them also does not exists for that x p = 0. It affect the effective
hunting or ability to scape represented by l i. In the next table there appears a list of

We have considered the following experimental data from the Serengeti ecosys-
tem in Tanzania and Kenya, East Africa. We consider 10 species of large carnivores,
and 28 different species of preys [40]. The carnivore animals in consideration are:
lion, hyena, leopard, cheetah, wild dog, silver-backed jackal, serval, caracal, wild cat
and golden jackal [41]. Some of the preys in the ecosystem are: wildebeest, zebra,
gazelle, oribi, buffalo or giraffe [40].

We start our analysis calculating the change in time of the energy Y of our eco-
logical lattice, for several values of g , which represents the biological neighborhood.
g can be adopt values of 1 − 5 taking into account the kilograms that those predators
can eat from different preys and the average number of predators that can be hunt
or eat the same prey. By considering the average days for gestational of ﬁve preda-
tors (lion, hyena, wild dog, leopard and cheetah) and some preys (wildebeest, zebra,
gazelle, oribi and buffalo), we use the next relation to determine the growth rate of
preys and predators

where the sum is over all the neighborhood species for preys and predators re-
spectively. By equation (35) and consider a total number of 1.1 predators per km2,
and a density of 3 preys per km2 [42], e p = 0.34 preys per month and e d = 0.294
predators per month taking into account and average gestational time.

By solving numerically the rate equations and taking a variational space from
1km2 to 100km2, we obtain the time evolution of the system. In Fig.(1) is plotted the
”energy” Y
, as a function of correlations (L) in units per month, for values of 0.2 <
a pp < 0.8. When a ii takes extreme values, the roots are complex. The ”energy” (Y )
of the system increases as a function of g , which represents the ecological association
of species similar to the coordinate number on the Ising model. On the other hand, if
one keep constant g = 3 and changes NT in the interval (41-410) km2, the behavior
of the temporal rate of change of the total population is shown in the ﬁgure (2).

Notice that for all the the g values, the largest changes in the total population of the
association occur when the long time correlation attains a value around 30. Obviously,
the system is more stable in its total population when the biological proximity has its
lowest value. In Fig.(2) we obtain that the ”energy” (Y ) of the system decrease as a
function of the number of populations that interact in the ecological system.

If simultaneously g and NT are changed, one obtains the behavior shown in
Fig.(3). The system is very sensitive to changes in g and NT . By decreasing NT and
increasing g , the maximum of the changes in the total population is obtained as a
function of long correlations (L) is shown in Fig. 3(a). The intermediate values of NT
and g obtain larger energy values. For example for NT = 220 and g = 3 the energy
of the system attains its maximum value. And for g = 5 and NT = 41 the system en-
ergy reaches its minimum value. Fig. 3(b) shows how decreasing values of NT and
decreasing values of g affects the time evolution of the association. In Fig. 3(b) can
be corroborated the heavy inﬂuence of g on the dynamics in the systems

In Fig.(4) it is shown the behavior of Y

as a function of long correlation for
different values of a according to the table (1). The effect of the long time correlation
on the time evolution of the system is stronger, and the system is more sensitive in a
more localized interval of values of L in units per month. This is more noticeable for
increasing values of a pp.

5 Comments and remarks

It is well known that the main limitation of the mean ﬁeld approaches is that the ef-
fect of the ﬂuctuation is disregarded. Of course this is a serious obstacle to describe
the system near critical conditions. However, even far from the critical conditions,
the ﬂuctuations can play an important role in the dynamics of the biological associ-
ation. Here we have shown that by means a mean ﬁeld approximation it is possible
to analyze the dynamics of a predator-prey association, and was possible to include
the interaction between nearest-neighbors for the i-th specie. We found the analytical
expression for the temporal evolution of the the total population in terms of the effec-
tive parameters which were correlated with some experimental data of 10 different
species of predators and 28 preys interacting with those population.

In these conditions the mean ﬁeld parameters con be time dependent quantities.
Under the proper conditions, this lattice model solved through a mean ﬁeld approach
constructed as an analogy with the Weiss approximation, allows us to describe the
total and i −thspecie mean ﬁelds, to develop an analytical expression for the ”energy”
of the time evolution of an ideal predator-prey association.

Bragg-Williams approximation for the dynamics of prey-predator biological associations

15

We have constructed a novel approach, the Bragg-Williams approximation for the
lattice model corresponding to the Ising model of a biological association, moreover,
we have shown that it is possible to mount the qualitative description of the ﬂuctu-
ations given by the Bragg-Williams approximation on the mean ﬁeld Weiss model
constructed for a biological association. The procedure is internally consistent and
qualitatively predicts the trends that one should expect about the role of the correla-
tions.

The general trends shown in ﬁgures is that when the system contains short time
correlations, the rate of change of the total population is small as well. This is due
to the inﬂuence of the correlation is very local in time. On the other extreme, when
the correlation time is large compared to the characteristic time of variation of the
populations, the system reaches the maximum value of ”energy” related to the rate of
change of the total population and the coordination number g .
