ABSTRACT

We analyze the kinematics of six Virgo cluster dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) from their globular
cluster (GC) systems. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy for three of them and reanalyze
the data found in the literature for the remaining three. We use two independent methods to estimate
the rotation amplitude (Vrot) and velocity dispersion (σGC) of the GC systems and evaluate their
statistical signiﬁcance by simulating non-rotating GC systems with the same number of GC satellites
and velocity uncertainties. Our measured kinematics agree with the published values for the three
galaxies from the literature and, in all cases, some rotation is measured. However, our simulations
show that the null hypothesis of being non-rotating GC systems cannot be ruled out. In the case
of VCC 1861, the measured Vrot and the simulations indicate that it is not rotating.
In the case
of VCC 1528, the null hypothesis can be marginally ruled out, thus, it might be rotating although
further conﬁrmation is needed. In our analysis, we ﬁnd that, in general, the measured Vrot tends to
be overestimated and the measured σGC tends to be underestimated by amounts that depend on the
intrinsic Vrot/σGC, the number of observed GCs (NGC), and the velocity uncertainties. The bias is
negligible when NGC & 20. In those cases where a large NGC is not available, it is imperative to obtain
data with small velocity uncertainties. For instance, errors of ≤ 2 km s−1 lead to Vrot < 10 km s−1
for a system that is intrinsically not rotating.

1. INTRODUCTION

Dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) are historically deﬁned
as having low luminosity (MB & −18), smooth and faint
surface brightness distribution (µB & 22 mag arcsec−2),
small amounts of interstellar gas and dust, and red col-
ors that indicate the presence of an old stellar pop-
ulation. Dwarf early-type galaxies are also the most
common galaxy class in high density environments (e.g.
Sandage et al. 1985; Binggeli et al. 1988) and they are
rarely found in isolation (Gavazzi et al. 2010; Geha et al.
2012).

Morphologically, dEs are apparently very simple
systems. However, the dE classiﬁcation, as any other
morphological classiﬁcation, is mainly based on the vi-
sual inspection of images. This makes the morphological
classiﬁcation strongly dependent on the data quality,
depth, and resolution. Therefore, it is not surprising
that, as better data becomes available, many galaxies

formerly classiﬁed as dEs show a substantial amount
of substructure in form of spiral arms, disks, and/or
(Jerjen et al. 2000; Barazza et al.

2007;
Ferrarese et al. 2006; Janz et al. 2012, 2014).

2003; Lisker et al.

Kinematics can be more revealing than morphol-
ogy, and indeed dEs with similar structural properties
can have very diﬀerent rotation speeds (Pedraz et al.
2002; Simien & Prugniel 2002; Geha et al. 2002, 2003;
van Zee et al. 2004; Chilingarian 2009; Toloba et al.
2009, 2011, 2014b,a, 2015; Ry´s et al. 2013, 2014). Re-
garding their stellar populations, they span a wide range
of subsolar metallicities, from [M/H] ∼ −0.1 to −1.5,
and old ages, from 1 to 14 Gyr (Michielsen et al. 2008;
Paudel et al. 2010; Koleva et al. 2011; Toloba et al.
2014a).

Classically, dEs have been considered primordial ob-
jects that formed early in dense environments and
evolved passively through out the cosmic time (e.g.

2

Toloba et al.

White & Rees 1978; White & Frenk 1991). However,
this galaxy class is rather heterogeneous. Thus, some
of the dEs — for instance those that show subtle spi-
ral structures —are likely to come from a progeni-
tor population that was transformed by the cluster
environment where they reside (e.g. Kormendy 1985;
Kormendy & Bender 2012; Boselli et al. 2008, 2014;
Moore et al. 1998; Mastropietro et al. 2005; Toloba et al.
2009, 2012, 2015). Which galaxies are the progenitors of
dEs and which mechanism dominates their transforma-
tion is still under debate.

Kinematics is a powerful tool to investigate the phys-
ical processes involved in the formation and evolu-
tion of galaxies. One extreme example is the kine-
matically decoupled core found in some massive early-
type galaxies (e.g. Krajnovi´c et al. 2011) and in a few
low mass early-type galaxies (e.g. Thomas et al. 2006;
Chilingarian et al. 2007; Toloba et al. 2014b, G´erou et
al., submitted). These could be remnants of galaxy merg-
ers or gas accretion, and are thus good indicators of the
formation history of the galaxy.

Halos of galaxies are particularly interesting because
they contain precious clues of their galaxy host assem-
bly history, like dynamical signatures of mergers, and can
trace their dark matter content (e.g. Hoﬀman et al. 2010;
Hopkins et al. 2010; Oser et al. 2010; Pillepich et al.
2014). Unfortunately, due to the rapid decrease of the
galaxy surface brightness with radius, stellar kinematics
can typically probe the galaxy dynamics and substruc-
ture only up to 1 − 2 half-light radius (Re). At a larger
radii, it is necessary to employ bright dynamical trac-
ers. Planetary nebulae and globular clusters (GCs) have
been used to analyze the dynamical ﬁeld and dark mat-
ter halo of massive early-type galaxies (e.g. Cˆot´e et al.
2001, 2003; Napolitano et al. 2009; Coccato et al. 2009;
Schuberth et al. 2010; Strader et al. 2011; Foster et al.
2011; Morganti et al. 2013; Pota et al. 2013).

While most work to-date has focused on the dynamical
signatures of halos of massive early-type galaxies, only
seven low mass early-type galaxies have been explored
out to large radii: the M31 satellites M32, NGC 205,
NGC 187, and NGC 145, studied in great detail us-
ing several hundreds of resolved stars thanks to their
proximity (Geha et al. 2006, 2010; Howley et al. 2013),
and three bright dE Virgo cluster members, VCC 1087,
VCC 1261, and VCC 1528. Due to the distance to the
Virgo cluster (∼16.5 Mpc; Mei et al. 2007) these last
three halos have been studied through the analysis of
GCs (Beasley et al. 2006, 2009).
In all seven cases, it
was found that some rotation was present in the outer
halos of these galaxies. Li et al. (2016, in preparation)
uses the GCs of Virgo cluster dEs to infer the proper-
ties of the average dark matter halo that hosts these low
mass galaxies.

In this work, we explore the dynamical properties of
the halos of the Virgo cluster dEs VCC 1539, VCC 1545,
and VCC 1861 using their GCs as tracers. These three
dEs are fainter than the previous dEs targeted in the
Virgo cluster by Beasley et al. (2006, 2009). In addition,
we reanalyze the GC systems of VCC 1087, VCC 1261,
and VCC 1528 using a method to obtain simultaneously
the rotation and velocity dispersion of the GC system,
described by Strader et al. (2011) and further exploited
for massive early-type galaxies by Pota et al. (2013).

To provide a solid statistical basis to this work, we ex-
plore the eﬀects on the measured kinematics when we use
ﬁnite samples of objects, which is the case of the analy-
sis of GCs. We simulate rotating and non-rotating GC
systems of typical dEs and analyze the statistical signif-
icance of the measured kinematics as a function of the
rotation speed and velocity dispersion of the GC system,
the number of GCs observed, and the observed velocity
uncertainties.

The GCs targeted are selected from the Next Gen-
eration Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS; Ferrarese et al.
2012) and from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS;
Peng et al. 2006; Jord´an et al. 2009). The NGVS is
∼ 900−hour program carried out at the Canada-France-
Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) between the years 2008 and
2013. The survey used MegaCam to make a panoramic
map in the u∗giz ﬁlters of the region contained within
the cluster virial radius covering a total area of 104 deg2.
A subset of this area has been followed-up in the infrared
(Mu˜noz et al. 2014). The NGVS has a point-source com-
pleteness limit of g ∼ 25.9 mag and a corresponding
surface brightness limit of µg ∼ 29 mag arcsec−2. The
exquisite data quality of the survey relies on an i band
median seeing of FWHM ∼ 0.54′′.

One of the most important data products the NGVS
will provide is an updated catalog of Virgo cluster galaxy
members, including new low surface brightness objects
and a full census of point-like sources in the direction
of Virgo, discriminating between Milky Way, Virgo, and
background objects based on color and sometimes spec-
troscopic information. Some papers already available
in the NGVS series discuss the globular cluster pop-
ulation in Virgo (Durrell et al. 2014), the dynamical
properties of star clusters, ultra-compact dwarf galax-
ies (UCDs) and galaxies in core of the cluster (Zhu et al.
2014; Zhang et al. 2015), the possible environmental ori-
gin of UCDs in Virgo’s three main subclusters (Liu
et al., in preparation), the dynamical and stellar pop-
ulation properties of early-type galaxies with similar
masses to the ones presented here but with higher cen-
tral surface brightnesses (Guerou et al. 2015), the tidal
interactions between galaxies in the cluster environment
(Arrigoni Battaia et al. 2012; Paudel et al. 2013), and
a catalog of photometric redshift estimations for back-
ground sources Raichoor et al. (2014).

This paper is organized as follows. The selection of
GC candidates, observations, data reduction, velocity
measurements, and membership analysis are described
in Section 2. The statistical methods used to estimate
the kinematics of GC systems are described in Section
3. The analysis of the eﬀects of having discrete samples
of GCs for rotating and non-rotating GC systems is pre-
sented in Section 4. The kinematics of the three new
dEs and the reanalysis of the kinematics of the three
dEs found in the literature are presented in Section 5.
We discuss our ﬁndings in Section 6, and summarize our
conclusions in Section 7.

2. DATA

This paper is focused on the analysis of the rota-
tion speed of the globular cluster systems of VCC 1087,
VCC 1261, VCC 1528, VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and
VCC 1861. The three former dEs are previously analyzed
by Beasley et al. (2006, 2009). The three latter dEs are

new observations presented here for the ﬁrst time. This
Section focuses on the description of the new data. Table
1 shows the properties of the six dEs.

VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861 are a subsample
of the larger Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of 21
dEs and their associated globular clusters described in
Guhatakurta et al. (2016, in preparation). In this paper
we focus on the three galaxies with the largest number
of observed GC satellites (≥ 9). The remaining 18 dEs
in our sample have ≤ 6 observed GC satellites, thus they
are not suitable for this kind of analysis. However, Li et
al. (2016, in prep.) combines the 82 GC satellites of all
21 dEs together to analyze the dark matter proﬁle of an
average dE.

Below we summarize the criteria used to select the tar-
gets, the observation strategy, and the reduction pro-
cedure for VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861 (full
details will be provided in Guhatakurta et al., in prep.).
The details of the target selection, observations, and data
reduction for VCC 1087, VCC 1261, and VCC 1528 are
described in Beasley et al. (2006, 2009).

2.1. Photometric Selection of Spectroscopic Candidates
Our parent sample comprises 21 low luminosity and
low surface brightness early-type galaxies that fall into
the NGVS footprint.
These 21 dEs have g band
magnitudes in the range −17.2 < Mg < −13.7 (see
Guhathakurta et al. 2016).

Nine out of the 21 dEs are observed with HST as part
of the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS; Cˆot´e et al.
2004). This survey is conducted in the g and z bands
and, due to the high spatial resolution of HST/ACS,
nearly all the GCs appear as extended sources (the spa-
tial resolution of HST/ACS, 0.05 ′′/pix, corresponds to
3.9 pc at the distance of the Virgo cluster). Peng et al.
(2006) demonstrates that the color-magnitude diagram
based on g and z band magnitudes in combination with
size information provide a clean separation between fore-
ground stars, GCs, and background galaxies. Thus, we
use the ACSVCS GC catalog of Peng et al. (2006) and
Jord´an et al. (2009) to select candidates of GC satellites
of the available nine dEs.

For the remaining 12 dEs not included in the ACSVCS
we use the NGVS GC catalog to select our sources. Due
to the large ﬁeld of view of the Keck/DEIMOS spec-
trograph (16.3′ × 5′) in comparison with the HST/ACS
camera (3.4′ × 3.4′) we also include NGVS GC candi-
dates at even larger radii for the dEs included in the
ACSVCS when possible. All the GC candidates are se-
lected to have colors of 0.5 < g − i < 1.4 which is the
expected color range for low luminosity early-type galax-
ies (Peng et al. 2006).

We restrict our selection to g < 24.5 even though we
know that the contamination below g = 23 is high. The
main source of contaminants at those faint magnitudes
are background galaxies, which are easily separated from
the GCs by their spectroscopic characteristics, i.e. emis-
sion lines.
In addition, to ﬁll the Keck/DEIMOS slit-
masks in the most eﬃcient way, we also include some
point-like objects with bluer colors than the GC candi-
dates (0.25 < g − i < 0.45). These are candidate Milky
Way foreground stars belonging to the Sagittarius stream
and the Virgo overdensity. The data related to these
foreground targets will be presented in a future paper

(Peng et al., in prep.). Table 2 shows a summary of all
the target objects in the parent sample and a breakdown
indicating whether they are spectroscopically conﬁrmed,
contaminants, or failed spectra due to instrumental ar-
tifacts. A number of objects are serendipitously inter-
cepted by the slits. In Table 2 we also indicate whether
these serendipitous detections are GC or Milky Way star
candidates.

Figure 1 shows the NGVS giz color images for
VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861. The color sym-
bols indicate GC that are conﬁrmed members of the dE
(see Section 2.3 for a description of the membership crite-
ria), foreground stars, background galaxies, and targeted
objects for which we could not measure a radial velocity
because of instrumental artifacts aﬀecting the spectrum.
Figure 2 shows the color distribution of the ACSVCS
sample of GC candidates for 100 Virgo cluster early-type
galaxies that span a luminosity range −22 < MB < −15.
The fraction of metal-rich GCs, i.e. red GCs, those with
g − z > 1.1 increases with luminosity, thus, the GC
satellites of dwarf early-type galaxies are mainly blue or
metal-poor (Peng et al. 2006; Jord´an et al. 2009). Figure
2 also shows the color distribution of the observed GC
satellites for the six galaxies analyzed here. The number
of red GC satellites is too small to analyze the blue and
red GCs separately for these galaxies.

2.2. Spectroscopy and Data Reduction

We use the DEIMOS spectrograph (Faber et al. 2003)
located at the Keck II 10 m telescope in the Mauna Kea
Observatory (Hawaii) to observe 9 slitmasks. The dEs
VCC 1539 and VCC 1861 are targeted in two diﬀerent
slitmasks while VCC 1545 is targeted in just one slit-
mask.

The observations are carried out using the 600 l/mm
grating centered at 7000 ˚A with slit widths of 0.8′′ and
the GG455 ﬁlter to block shorter wavelength light. All
slits are aligned with the mask position angle. This
instrumental conﬁguration provides a wavelength cov-
erage of 4800 − 9500 ˚A with a spectral pixel scale of
0.52 ˚A/pixel, and a spectral resolution of 2.8 ˚A (FWHM)
or an instrumental resolution of ∼ 50 km s−1. The ex-
posure time for each mask ranges between 3600 s and
4800 s under seeing conditions of 0.6′′ − 0.9′′ (FWHM).
The diﬀerent exposure time for each mask is an attempt
to compensate for the non-uniformity of the observing
conditions, such as transparency, seeing, moon light, etc.
In Table 3 we summarize the observations.

The raw two-dimensional spectra are reduced and ex-
tracted into one-dimensional spectra using the stan-
dard spec2d pipeline for DEIMOS designed by the
DEEP Galaxy Redshift Survey team (Cooper et al. 2012;
Newman et al. 2013) and modiﬁed by Simon & Geha
(2007) to optimize the reduction of unresolved targets
and by Kirby et al. (2015) to make it more suitable
for bluer DEIMOS spectra, given that the standard
DEIMOS pipeline was designed for the 1200 l/mm grat-
ing. The main steps in the reduction process consist of
ﬂat-ﬁeld and fringe corrections, wavelength calibration,
sky subtraction, and cosmic ray cleaning. Due to the
large tilt of the grating to achieve blue wavelengths (cen-
tral wavelength 7000 ˚A instead of the nominal 7200 ˚A),
some ghosts appear in the two-dimensional spectra for

some of the slits resulting in inaccurate wavelength cal-
ibration in the region < 6500 ˚A. We use the sky lines
located at 5200 ˚A, 5577 ˚A, and 6300 ˚A to make small
linear adjustments in the wavelength calibration, i.e. the
adjustment (∆λ) is a ﬁrst order polynomial that depends
on the wavelength (∆λ = aλ + b, a and b are the best
ﬁt slope and intercept for the observed wavelength of the
three sky lines with respect to their intrinsic wavelength).
After applying this correction, the accuracy of the wave-
length calibration is 0.03 ˚A. However, the region of the
spectra with λ < 5200 ˚A is not used to measure radial
velocities because our data has a low signal-to-noise ratio
(a median of S/N 4 ˚A−1 in the calcium triplet region and
even lower at wavelengths bluer than 7500 ˚A where the
detector blazes) and because the bluest wavelengths are
not covered for all slits due to their placement in the slit-
mask. We assess the reliability of the measured radial ve-
locities performing two tests: 1) we split the wavelength
coverage in two pieces at ∼ 7000 ˚A and measure the ra-
dial velocity independently in both pieces; 2) we compare
the radial velocities obtained for repeated measurements
of target objects. In both cases, the resulting diﬀerence

in the measured radial velocities divided by the square
root of the quadratic sum of their errors follows a Gaus-
sian distribution whose width is unity (see the Appendix
for more details on how the radial velocities are measured
and how their uncertainties are estimated).

The reduced one-dimensional spectrum is obtained by
identifying the target in the reduced two-dimensional
spectrum and extracting a small window centered on
it. The target is identiﬁed by ﬁnding the peak of the
spatial intensity proﬁle obtained by collapsing the two-
dimensional spectrum in the wavelength direction. A
Gaussian function is ﬁtted to the target and its width is
used as extraction window. The one-dimensional spec-
trum is obtained by extracting the spectra within this
window weighting by the Gaussian distribution, i.e. each
pixel is weighted by the value of the Gaussian distribu-
tion in that same pixel. This follows the standard opti-
mal extracting scheme of Horne (1986). In some cases
this technique fails due to instrumental eﬀects such as
bad columns. When that happens the extraction win-
dow is a boxcar centered on the target.

ferent S/N. The spectra are put into the rest frame using

To determine which of the observed GC candidates are
GC satellites of the three dEs studied in this paper we use
the two dimensional space shown in Figure 4. We deﬁne
as satellites those globular clusters that lie within the re-
gion |∆V | < 200 km s−1, which represents ∼ 8 times the
central velocity dispersion of the dE, and ∆R/Re< 10.
This region is chosen because it has the lowest fraction
of contaminants by chance superposition.

To measure the fraction of contaminants we scramble
the systemic velocities of all 21 dEs preserving their posi-
tion in the sky, thus, these artiﬁcial dEs have a sky posi-
tion and systemic velocity consistent with being members
of the Virgo cluster. However, the randomly assigned ve-
locity must be at least 800 km s−1 diﬀerent from its true
systemic velocity to avoid artiﬁcial dEs that are very
close to the true dEs. We make this scramble exercise
100 times and count how many objects are found within
the satellite region deﬁned by |∆V | < 200 km s−1and
∆R/Re< 10. On average, 3.2 ± 0.7 GCs appear in the
GC satellite region combining all 21 galaxies. Thus the
contamination rate in this region is 3.7%. Making this
GC satellite region larger rapidly increases the number of
contaminants, however, making it smaller does not make
this number decrease. Therefore, |∆V | < 200 km s−1and
∆R/Re< 10 represents the best compromise.

For each object targeted in our observations, which
include all GC candidates and foreground stars, we com-
bine the projected angular distance and the relative ve-
locity with respect to the full sample of 21 dEs in the
following way:

where ∆R is the projected angular distance between the
target object and a dE, Re is the half light radius of the
dE, ∆V = VGC−Vsys is the radial velocity diﬀerence be-
tween the target object and the dE, and ¯σ is the average
velocity dispersion of the dE, we use a value of 30 km s−1
for all dEs. However, the number of GC satellites does
not change if ¯σ is ∼ 15 km s−1 larger or smaller.

For each observed target we have 21 values of D (ob-
tained following Equation 1), one with respect to each
dE in our full sample of dEs. We ﬁnd the minimum D
for each target and plot it in the membership diagram

shown in Figure 4. If the candidate lies within the re-
gion deﬁned by |∆V | < 200 km s−1 and ∆R/Re< 10 the
candidate is considered a GC satellite. All the objects
that are classiﬁed as GC satellites have sizes and colors
expected for GCs bound to dEs (Peng et al. 2006), i.e.
none of the targeted foreground stars ended up in the
membership region.

This method of minimizing simultaneously the posi-
tion and the velocity allows us to ﬁnd the most likely
host amongst the 21 dEs in our parent sample. Our dEs
are separated by a few arcmin, since our target selection
includes as many galaxies as possible in a single slitmask,
and are not close in projection to any other large galaxy.
This means there are minimal chances that a GC satel-
lite of one of our dEs, is in fact part of the GC system
of a galaxy that is not in our sample. We will, however,
remark on the fact that there are 64 GCs in our slitmasks
that do not belong to any of the 21 dEs that comprise our
parent sample. These are likely to be members of Virgo
cluster massive galaxies at ∆R/Re≫ 10. This analysis
is the focus of a future paper.

The properties of the GC satellites of VCC 1539,
VCC 1545, and VCC 1861 are presented in Table 4.
VCC 1539 has a GC system that is more spatially con-
centrated than that of VCC 1545 and VCC 1861 (Figures
1 and 4). This may be related with its lower luminosity
and S´ersic index (see Table 1), which could be an indi-
cation of a lower mass and less extended halo. See Li et
al. (in prep.) for a discussion of the halo masses of these
galaxies.

3. MEASUREMENT OF ROTATION SPEED, POSITION

ANGLE, AND VELOCITY DISPERSION OF THE

GLOBULAR CLUSTER SYSTEMS

We apply two diﬀerent methods to measure the rota-
tion speed, position angle, and velocity dispersion of the
GC system. The ﬁrst method, rotation ﬁt (RF), consists
on ﬁtting a rotation model to obtain the rotation speed
and the position angle, and then estimate the velocity
dispersion of the GCs as their mean deviation from the
model (e.g.; Cˆot´e et al. 2001, 2003; Beasley et al. 2006,
2009).

The second method, rotation and dispersion simul-
taneous ﬁt (RDSF), consists on simultaneously ﬁtting
the rotation speed, the position angle, and the velocity
dispersion of the GC system (e.g.; Strader et al. 2011;
Foster et al. 2011; Pota et al. 2013).

Regardless of the method used, we assume that the
GC system is spherical. The ellipticity of the GC system
cannot be constrained with the very small number of GCs
observed in each dE. We also assume that the projected
velocity ﬁeld of a galaxy can be described in a ﬁrst order
approximation by a cosine function:

Vmod = Vsys + Vrot cos(P A − P Amax)

(2)

where Vmod is the velocity model that best ﬁts the GC
system, Vsys is the velocity of the main body of the dE,
Vrot is the amplitude of the cosine function which indi-
cates the maximum measured rotation speed, P A is the
position angle of each GC satellite with respect to the
center of the dE, and PAmax is the phase of the cosine
function and indicates the position angle of the maximum
rotation speed. This model ﬁts an average rotation curve
to the whole system and it assumes that this curve has

Fig. 4.— Membership diagram. The velocity vs. projected an-
gular position space is used to determine which GC candidates are
satellites of the dEs. From top to bottom the membership cri-
teria is applied to VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861. The
parameter ∆V is the diﬀerence between the radial velocity of the
candidate and the radial velocity of the dE. The parameter ∆R/Re
is the projected angular diﬀerence between the candidate and the
dE normalized by the Re of the dE. All the GCs that are within
the red box (∆V < 200 km s−1 and ∆R/Re< 10) are considered
to be satellites of that dE. The black dots outside the red box are
GC satellites of a diﬀerent galaxy or foreground stars.

sinusoidal symmetry, i.e.
it is maximum along an axis
characterized by PAmax and minimum in the orthogonal
axis.

3.1. Rotation Fit Method (RF)

We use a non-linear least squares method to ﬁnd the
best ﬁt cosine function for the GC system of each dE. The
inverse squared of the velocity uncertainties are used as
weights in the ﬁtting procedure following the mathemat-
ical expression:

where the subindex i indicates the i−th GC, NGC is the
observed number of GCs for the target galaxy, Vmod is
deﬁned in Equation 2, and δV is the uncertainty in the
line-of-sight radial velocity V . The velocity dispersion of
the GC system, σGC, is measured as the mean departure

of the GC satellites with respect to the best ﬁt cosine
function for each dE.

The uncertainties in Vrot, PAmax, and σGC are esti-
mated using a numerical bootstrap procedure as sug-
gested by Cˆot´e et al. (2001, 2003). This method does
not make any assumption about the size and shape of
the uncertainties and about the parent distribution. We
generate 1000 artiﬁcial data sets by choosing at random
globular clusters from the actual sample under consider-

NGVS XVI. Angular Momentum of dEs from GC Satellites

ation allowing repetition. The sizes of the artiﬁcial data
sets are the same as the size of the actual sample of glob-
ular clusters in the target galaxy. Each artiﬁcial data set
is analyzed using the same procedure as described above.
The estimated uncertainties are the 68% conﬁdence in-
tervals (1σG).

3.2. Rotation and Dispersion Simultaneous Fit Method

(RDSF)

The parameters Vrot, PAmax, and σGC can be simul-
taneously obtained by minimizing the following function
using a maximum likelihood statistical approach:

χ2 ∝

Xi=1

(cid:26) (Vi − Vmod)2
GC + δV 2
σ2

i

+ ln[σ2

i ](cid:27)
GC + δV 2

(4)

the subindex i, NGC, Vmod, and δV are the same as in
Equation 3. This method has been extensively used to
estimate the rotation and dispersion of the GC systems
bound to massive early-type galaxies (e.g. Foster et al.
2011; Strader et al. 2011; Pota et al. 2013). Note that, in
those cases, the analysis is done in annuli centered in the
galaxy. For dwarf galaxies, the number of GC satellites
is not large enough to split it in annuli of diﬀerent radius.
The uncertainties in Vrot, PAmax, and σGC are esti-
mated applying the same bootstrap procedure as the one
described in Section 3.1.

The RDSF method is based on a kinematical model
that includes both rotation and dispersion simultane-
ously and uses a likelihood function to evaluate the prob-
ability of a measument (Vi ± δVi) being drawn from a
Gaussian distribution of model velocities. Contrary to
the RF method, where the kinematical model only in-
cludes rotation and the dispersion is obtained as a sec-
ond step in the analysis, assuming that the mean scatter
of the measured velocities with respect to the best ﬁt
rotating model is a good estimation of the dispersion.

3.3. Statistical Signiﬁcance of the Measured Rotation
The ﬁtting methods RF and RDSF in combination
with the bootstrap procedure provide a measurement and
an uncertainty of the rotation amplitude of the system.
However, this measurement needs to be further tested
to check whether that value is consistent or not with a
spurious measurement of a non-rotating system. For ex-
ample, in a extreme case where a dE only has one GC
satellite, the best ﬁt model will perfectly ﬁt it providing
a σGC of 0 km s−1and a Vrot of inﬁnity.
If instead of
one GC, the dE has two GC satellites, the best ﬁt model
will always go through both GCs, thus providing again
a σGC of 0 km s−1 and, in this case, Vrot will depend on
the PAs of the GCs. If the PAs are very similar, then
Vrot will tend to inﬁnity.
In these two cases, it is not
possible to know whether the GC system is rotating or
it is not, however, the methods will provide a very high
rotation amplitude.

To address the statistical signiﬁcance of the the mea-
sured rotation, we test whether the null hypothesis of the
measured rotation being consistent with a non-rotating
system can be rejected. We perform two types of simu-
lations to test this null hypothesis: velocity constrained
simulations and velocity unconstrained simulations.

The velocity constrained simulations (VCS) consist of
simulating artiﬁcial non-rotating GC systems based on
the observed line-of-sight GC velocity measurements and
their uncertainties for each dE. We make these simula-
tions using three independent approaches, but all of them
keep coupled the line-of-sight velocity measurements and
their associated uncertainties. The ﬁrst approach gener-
ates a uniform distribution of PAs. Then a random PA
between 0◦ and 360◦ is assigned to each GC velocity.
We repeat this exercise 10000 times and each time we
apply the RDSF method to obtain the best ﬁt Vrot, σGC,
and PAmax. The second and third approaches consist of
randomly assigning a measured PA to each GC velocity
and its associated uncertainty. In the second method we
bootstrap the PAs with repetition, i.e. we assign a new
PA to each velocity measurement and its uncertainty by
randomly choosing a new value from the measured PAs,
repeated values are allowed, and in the third method we
bootstrap the PAs without repetition, i.e. the PAs are
scrambled. As done for the ﬁrst approach, we repeat this
exercise 10000 times and each time we apply the RDSF
method to obtain the best ﬁt Vrot, σGC, and PAmax.

The velocity unconstrained simulations (VUS) consist
of simulating artiﬁcial non-rotating GC systems based
on the velocity uncertainties of the full sample of 82 GC
satellites observed in all 21 Virgo cluster dEs. We assume
Vrot = 0 km s−1 for these models but we test diﬀerent
σGC given that the intrinsic value is unknown. These ar-
tiﬁcial GC systems are generated following these steps:
(1) we randomly choose NGC velocity uncertainties from
our sample of 82 GC satellites which has a median ve-
locity uncertainty of δVGC = 19 km s−1; (2) we assign
a random PA between 0◦ and 360◦ to each GC; (3) we
assign a velocity of 0 km s−1 to each GC; (4) to make a re-
alistic model, we perturb the velocity of each GC within
a Gaussian function whose width is the assumed velocity
dispersion of the GC system and within another Gaussian
function whose width is the velocity uncertainty chosen
in step (1). As done for the VCS, we repeat this exercise
10000 times, apply the RDSF method to each model, and
measure Vrot, σGC, and PAmax.

4. FINITE SAMPLING AND VELOCITY UNCERTAINTY
EFFECTS ON THE KINEMATICS OF GC SYSTEMS

We explore the eﬀects due to discrete samples of ve-
locities on modeled GC systems with diﬀerent Vrot/σGC
values, diﬀerent GC sample sizes, and diﬀerent velocity
uncertainties. To create realistic GC systems we base
our models on real data. For this reason, we use the
full sample of 82 GC satellites observed in all 21 Virgo
cluster dEs.

We explore these eﬀects by running the VUS simula-
tions following the steps described in Section 3.3. As
these simulations model rotating and non-rotating sys-
tems, the velocity assigned to each GC is calculated fol-
lowing Equation 2. We assume that each modelled GC
system has PAmax = 45◦ and σGC = 30 km s−1. The
assumed Vrot is the value that corresponds to the ﬁxed
Vrot/σGC in the model. We repeat this exercise 10000
times, apply the RDSF method to each model, and mea-
sure Vrot and σGC.

For each assumed Vrot/σGC we select subsamples of
GCs of diﬀerent sizes. The largest subsample consists
of all 82 GCs, the remaining subsamples consist of 30,

10

Toloba et al.

20, 11, 7, and 5 GCs. There are two ways of selecting
a subsample of GCs: (1) by creating a parent sample
of GCs assigning a random PA to each one of the 82
GCs. In each realization, the GCs are selected from the
parent sample; (2) by randomly choosing a subsample
of GCs in each realization. Both methods get the same
quantitative results and, thus, the same conclusions. We
show the results obtained by using the second method.

4.1. Finite sampling eﬀects on rotating and

non-rotating GC systems

We explore the ﬁnite sampling eﬀects on GC sys-
tems with Vrot/σGC = 0, 0.5, 1, and 2. Figures 5
and 6 show the density maps that result from running
10000 VUS simulations for modelled GC systems with
Vrot/σGC = 0 and 1, respectively, and a diﬀerent number
of GC satellites. The results for modelled GC systems
with Vrot/σGC = 0.5 and 2 are not shown because the re-
sults for Vrot/σGC = 0.5 are in between the two examples
shown and the results for Vrot/σGC = 2 are very similar
those of Vrot/σGC = 1.

Regardless of the Vrot/σGC of the GC model, the dis-
tribution of simulations becomes bimodal for σGC if
NGC < 20. The number of simulations clustered in each
peak of the distribution depends on NGC. As NGC de-
creases, the peak that contains the largest number of
simulations moves towards σGC = 0 km s−1. This is an
artifact produced by the ﬁtting process as discussed in
Section 3.3.

The velocity dispersion σGC is underestimated in all
the modelled GC systems if NGC ≤ 20. This under-
estimation increases when NGC decreases. In contrast,
the rotation amplitude Vrot tends to be overestimated.
This overestimation is larger for GC systems with lower
Vrot/σGC, indicating that GC systems that rotate very
slowly or do not rotate at all are signiﬁcantly more diﬃ-
cult to measure than GC systems that rotate fast. This
Vrot overestimation also increases when NGC decreases.
In summary, a data set with NGC & 20 and a median
velocity uncertainty of ∼ 16 km s−1 is enough to estimate
whether the GC system is rotating or not. If the GC sys-
tem is rotating, the Vrot estimated is not aﬀected by large
biases if the GC system has Vrot/σGC & 1, or, in other
words, Vrot & 30 km s−1 for an assumed σGC∼ 30 km s−1.
If the GC system is not rotating, the Vrot obtained will
be aﬀected by a systematic bias of the order of the me-
dian velocity uncertainty, i.e. ∼ 16 km s−1 in this case.
If the data set consists of NGC . 10, the systematic bias,
both in the rotation speed and the velocity dispersion, is
in between the median velocity uncertainty and the in-
trinsic velocity dispersion of the dE. This bias depends
on the intrinsic Vrot/σGC which is unknown, thus, this
bias cannot be corrected. However, the measured Vrot
can be considered as an upper limit and the measured
σGC as a lower limit.

4.2. Velocity uncertainty eﬀects on rotating and

non-rotating GC systems

We explore the eﬀects that the velocity uncertainties
(δVGC) have on the measured Vrot and σGC. We repeat
the VUS simulations run in Section 4.1 but assuming ve-
locity uncertainties that are 40%, 70%, and 90% smaller
than our measured values. These correspond to median
uncertainties of 10, 4, and 2 km s−1.

Figures 7 and 8 show the Vrot and σGC biases as a
function of NGC for diﬀerent median velocity uncertain-
ties and Vrot/σGC values. The velocity uncertainties
have a larger eﬀect in systems with small numbers of
GCs. Figure 9 shows these eﬀects for a GC system with
σGC = 30 km s−1, Vrot/σGC = 1, and NGC ≤ 11. The
bimodal distribution of σGC seen in Figures 5 and 6 for
NGC ≤ 11 disappears when δVGC < 10 km s−1. In addi-
tion, the underestimation of σGC and overestimation of
Vrot described in Section 4.1 decrease for smaller velocity
uncertainties.

5. ANALYSIS THE GLOBULAR CLUSTER SYSTEMS

In this Section we analyze the three new GC sys-
tems presented in this paper, those bound to VCC 1539,
VCC 1545, and VCC 1861, and we reanalyze the GC
systems of VCC 1087, VCC 1261, and VCC 1528 from
Beasley et al. (2006, 2009).

5.1. Globular Cluster Systems of VCC 1539,

VCC 1545, and VCC 1861

VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861 are located in
the inner core of the Virgo cluster. Their projected dis-
tance to M87 are between 0.88◦, 0.89◦, and 2.76◦, re-
spectively (the virial radius of the Virgo cluster, consid-
ering M87 at its center, is R200 = 5.38◦ = 1.55 Mpc;
Ferrarese et al. 2012).

These three dEs are ∼ 1 mag fainter than the brightest
dEs, which have MV ∼ −18, (e.g.; Ferguson & Binggeli
1994). They are very round, with ellipticities of ǫ . 0.1,
and they do not show any disk-like structures, such as
bars, spiral arms, or irregular features,
in the NGVS
deep images (see Figure 10), conﬁrming the lack of
substructure found by Lisker et al. (2006a, 2007) based
on the much swallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey im-
ages (SDSS; Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008). The stel-
lar kinematics is available for VCC 1545 and VCC 1861.
While VCC 1545 rotates at a speed of ∼ 25 km s−1
(Chilingarian 2009), VCC 1861 is not rotating (its stel-
lar rotation is 5.3±2.5 km s−1; Toloba et al. 2011, 2014a,
2015). See Table 1 for a summary of the main properties
of these dEs.

The number of spectroscopically observed and con-
ﬁrmed GC satellites for VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and
VCC 1861 is similar to the dEs presented in the literature
(Beasley et al. 2006, 2009). Figure 11 shows the velocity
maps of their observed GC satellites. For VCC 1539, the
9 observed GC satellites are within 2Re. For VCC 1545,
the 14 observed GC satellites are are within 7Re. Fi-
nally, for VCC 1861, the 18 observed GC satellites are
within 7Re. This very diﬀerent spatial distribution of
the GC satellites may be related to the intrinsic proper-
ties of these galaxies. For example, VCC 1539 has a very
compact GC system. This galaxy is the faintest of the
three and has the lowest S´ersic index, however, its light
concentration, measured by the ratio R80/R20 (see Table
1), is not the highest. Li et al. (in prep.) analyze the
total mass and radial extent of the dark matter halos of
these galaxies, which may shed more light on this.

We apply the RF and RDSF methods to the GC sys-
tems of these three dEs. The best ﬁt cosine function
for each method and each galaxy is shown in Figure 12.
The best ﬁt Vrot, σGC, and PAmax can be found in Table
5. The resulting kinematic parameters obtained in the

Fig. 6.— Same as Figure 5 for a rotating GC system with Vrot/σGC = 1.

RF and RDSF methods agree well within the 1σG uncer-
tainties. Fixing the rotation axis, PAmax, to reduce the
number of free parameters in the ﬁtting procedure does
not change the estimated kinematics.

We test the statistical signiﬁcance of our measurements
by running the VCS and VUS simulations described in
Section 3.3. Figure 13 shows that the cumulative dis-
tribution of the PAs for the observed GC systems are
uniform, thus the ﬁrst approach for the VCS simulations

is justiﬁed. The upper row of Figure 14 shows the re-
sulting density map of applying the ﬁrst approach of the
VCS simulations. The second approach shows an even
broader and more elongated density maps because the
PA and the velocity are coupled, and the third approach
gives density maps that look nearly identical to the ﬁrst
approach. Because of the similarities between the three
approaches, we choose to show only the ﬁrst approach
for the VCS simulations.

not be rejected. In the case of VCC 1539 and VCC 1545,
where the RF and RDSF methods estimate some rota-
tion, this indicates that the measured rotation amplitude
is not signiﬁcant. However, in the case of VCC 1861,
where the rotation speed estimated by using the RF and
RDSF methods is consistent with zero, this conﬁrms that
the GC system bound to this dE is not rotating.

5.2. Analysis of Globular Cluster Systems from the

Literature

VCC 1087, VCC 1261, and VCC 1528 are also located
in the inner core of the Virgo cluster. Their projected
distance to M87 are 0.88◦, 1.62◦, and 1.20◦, respectively.
They are brighter and more elongated than the three dEs
analyzed here for the ﬁrst time. They do not show any
disk-like structures, such as bars, spiral arms, or irregular
features, in the NGVS deep images (see Figure 10), also
conﬁrming the previous analysis by Lisker et al. (2006a,
2007) based on the SDSS images. The x-shapes found
for VCC 1261, VCC 1528, and VCC 1545 in the g band
residual images are typical of disky and boxy isophotes
(see Figure 10). These three dEs are slow rotators based
on the stellar rotation speed estimation by Toloba et al.
(2014a, 2015). See Table 1 for a summary of the main
properties of these dEs.

We apply the RF method to these three dEs, as it was
previously done by Beasley et al., and we ﬁnd a good
agreement with their published values within the 1σG
uncertainties. We also apply the RDSF method and ﬁnd
a good agreement with the RF method within the 1σG
uncertainties. The estimated kinematics obtained by ﬁx-
ing the rotation axis, thus, with one less free parameter
in the ﬁtting process, is also in good agreement within
the 1σG uncertainties. Figure 15 shows the best ﬁt co-
sine functions using the RF and RDSF methods for each
dE. The best ﬁt Vrot, σGC, and PAmax can be found in
Table 5.

We repeat the same exercise as in Section 5 to test the

Fig. 7.— Rotation amplitude bias as a function of the number
of observed GCs satellites for diﬀerent Vrot/sigGC values. The
parameter ∆V measures the diﬀerence between the median rota-
tion amplitude obtained in the 10000 VUS and the rotation am-
plitude of the input model. For this particular case, the models
have σGC= 30 km s−1. The thick lines indicate the rotation am-
plitude bias and the thin lines indicate the percentiles 84 and 16 of
the distribution of the VUS. The light blue solid lines indicate the
results obtained for a median line-of-sight GC velocity uncertainty
of 19 km s−1, the same as in our data. The dark blue dotted lines
indicate the results for an 11 times smaller median uncertainty. As
Vrot/σGC is an unknown parameter of the GC system the bias can-
not be subtracted from the data but it can be signiﬁcantly reduced
by increasing the number of observed GC satellites.

Fig. 8.— Same as Figure 7 but for the velocity dispersion. This
trend looks nearly identical for all the Vrot/σGC values analyzed.

To run the VUS simulations, we need to choose a
σGC. We estimate σGC by measuring the standard de-
viation of the line-of-sight radial velocities of the target
GC system and subtracting the squared uncertainties.
We run the VUS simulations for diﬀerent σGC in the
range σGC ±15 km s−1. The results are the same for all
the tried velocity dispersions, the lower row of Figure 14
shows the resulting density map for the estimated σGC.
Figure 14 shows that the measured Vrot and σGC for
each GC system are between the 1σG and the 2σG con-
tours of the VCS and VUS simulations for non-rotating
systems. Therefore, the null hypothesis of the measured
Vrot being consistent with a non-rotating GC system can-

of boxy and disky isophotes.

Fig. 14.— Density map that results from creating 10000 non-rotating GC systems using the VCS simulations in the upper row and the
VUS simulations in the lower row (see Section 3.3 for a description of the VCS and VUS simulations). The blue dot indicates the best ﬁt
Vrot and σGC for each GC system using the RDSF method. The green dot indicates the input Vrot/σGC for the VUS simulations. The solid
red line contour encloses 68% of the simulations. The dashed orange contour encloses 95.5% of the simulations. The dotted yellow contour
encloses 99.7% of the simulations. NGC indicates the number of GCs in the system, and thus in the simulations, and δVGC indicates
the median velocity uncertainty in our data. The best ﬁt Vrot and σGC are always within the 2σG contours for non-rotating systems.
This indicates that the measured kinematics are not statistically signiﬁcant because they can be obtained by chance in a non-rotating GC
system.

ulations also provide quantitatively the same results. As
it happened for VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861,
the ﬁrst and third approaches look nearly identical and
the second approach has a more elongated and broader
contours. Thus, we chose to show only the ﬁrst approach
in the upper row of Figure 17.

To run the VUS simulations, we estimate σGC as in
Section 5. We also run the VUS simulations in the range
σGC ±15 km s−1 and ﬁnd that the results are qualita-
tively the same for all the input velocity dispersions, thus
we choose to show in Figure 17 the density map resulting
for the estimated σGC.

Figure 17 shows that the measured Vrot and σGC in
all three GC systems are between the 1σG and 2σG con-
tours of the VCS and VUS simulations for non-rotating
systems. VCC 1528’s measurements are right on the 2σG
level, so maybe the rotation amplitude is marginally sig-

niﬁcant for this galaxy although its σGC = 0 km s−1 is
certainly underestimated given that our simulations show
that a zero σGC is the most likely result for systems with
large velocity uncertainties and a low number of GCs (see
Section 4). The measured Vrot and σGC for VCC 1087
and VCC 1261 are between the 1σG and 2σG contours of
the VCS and VUS simulations for non-rotating systems.
Therefore, the null hypothesis of the measured rotation
amplitude being consistent with a non-rotating system
cannot be rejected. This suggests that the measured Vrot
for VCC 1087 and VCC 1261 are not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, indicating that it is still unknown whether the GC
systems of these dEs are rotating or not.
In the case
of VCC 1528, its GC system may be rotating and the
Vrot estimated should be cautiously considered an upper
limit.

Fig. 15.— Same as Figure 12 for VCC 1087, VCC 1261, and
VCC 1528. The data for these galaxies are from the literature
(Beasley et al. 2006, 2009), see Section 5.2 for details.

Kinematics is a powerful tool to study the formation
and evolution of galaxies.
In the case of Virgo cluster
dEs, the amplitude of the rotation curve depends on the
position of the galaxy in the cluster, i.e. slow rotators
are found in the center of the cluster while the fastest ro-
tators tend to be in the outer regions. This may suggest
that the dynamics of these dEs are being transformed by
the environment (Toloba et al. 2009, 2015).

The kinematics of the outer halos of galaxies can gen-

Toloba et al.

erally be used to constrain their mass assembly history.
For example, ﬁnding outer halo rotation could be inter-
preted as evidence for a major merger that transfered
angular momentum to the outer regions of the remnant
galaxy (e.g.; Cˆot´e et al. 2001, 2003). On the other hand,
not ﬁnding rotation in the outer halo, or ﬁnding that
the outer halo is dominated by dispersion, can be in-
terpreted as the accretion of multiple GC systems (e.g.;
Wang et al. 2011). In the case of low mass cluster galax-
ies, as the Virgo cluster dEs analyzed here, ﬁnding or not
rotation in the GC system is an indication of the envi-
ronmental mechanism aﬀecting them (e.g.; Boselli et al.
2008; S´anchez-Janssen & Aguerri 2012).

At high masses, several works study the kinematics of
red and blue GC satellites (metal-rich and metal poor
GCs, respectively) in comparison with the stellar kine-
matics of the galaxy. Although in many cases it seems
that the red GCs are coupled to the stellar kinemat-
ics while the blue GCs are decoupled from the stars
(e.g.; Romanowsky et al. 2009; Schuberth et al. 2010;
Strader et al. 2011; Norris et al. 2012) there are some
other cases where all three components are coupled or
decoupled (Pota et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015). The number
of GC systems analyzed in massive early-type galaxies is
still small to make any conclusions based on luminos-
ity, other internal properties, or the environment. This
makes it very diﬃcult to guess the expected kinematics
of dE GC satellites.

We measure the kinematics of the globular cluster sys-
tems bound to six Virgo cluster dEs. We ﬁnd that the
GC system of VCC 1861 is not rotating, in the same
way that its stars are not rotating (Toloba et al. 2011,
2014a). The GC system of VCC 1528 may be rotat-
ing. VCC 1528’s is a slow rotator based on its stellar
dynamics (Toloba et al. 2014a, 2015). We measure some
rotation for the remaining four GC systems which are
consistent with previous works, but, after careful simu-
lations we ﬁnd that these measurements are not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. Thus, it remains still unknown whether
the GC systems of VCC 1087, VCC 1261, VCC 1539,
and VCC 1545 are rotating or not.

With secure dynamical information for only one GC
system, it is diﬃcult to draw any conclusions on forma-
tion scenarios. However, it is an important ﬁrst step
towards a database of Virgo galaxies, ranging from high
to low masses, with stellar and GC kinematic informa-
tion. Our analysis shows that the current number of
observed GC satellites and the velocity uncertainties are
not enough to conclude that these dEs have a disky origin
as suggested by Beasley et al. (2009). This conclusion
should be revisited with an improved data set.

Measuring the rotation speed of GC systems bound to
dwarf galaxies is technically very challenging. The RF
and RDSF methods, extensively used in the literature,
produce some overestimation of Vrot and underestima-
tion of σGC, specially when the number of observed GC
satellites is small. In the most extreme case of having
only 1 GC in the system, the RF and RDSF methods ﬁt
a cosine function that goes through this 1 GC ﬁnding an
inﬁnite rotation amplitude and a zero velocity dispersion.
We study the eﬀects that the number of GC satellites
and the velocity uncertainties have on the measured Vrot
and σGC for rotating and non-rotating GC systems. We
ﬁnd that Vrot tends to be overestimated and σGC tends to

be underestimated. These oﬀsets depend on parameters
that are unknown, such as Vrot/σGC, and on other pa-
rameters that we can control, such as the number of GCs
in the sample and the velocity uncertainties. This indi-
cates that the systematic biases cannot be corrected but
they can be reduced. For GC systems with NGC . 10,
the measured Vrot can be considered an upper limit and
the measured σGC a lower limit. For GC systems with
NGC & 20, the bias in Vrot and σGC is close to zero
for systems with Vrot/σGC & 1, i.e.
for systems with
Vrot & 30 km s−1 if σGC ∼ 30 km s−1. For systems with
Vrot/σGC < 1, the bias is typically half the median veloc-
ity uncertainty. These biases can be signiﬁcantly reduced
with small velocity uncertainties, however, they do not
fully disappear.

7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a state-of-the-art measurement and
compilation of the largest sample of GC velocities in
dwarf early-type galaxies. Our catalog consists of 82 new
velocity measurements of GC satellites of 21 dEs, and 34
velocity measurements of GC satellites of 3 dEs from the
literature.

We use Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy to analyze, for

the ﬁrst time, the kinematics of the GC systems bound
to the Virgo cluster dEs VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and
VCC 1861. These are the three dEs with the largest num-
ber of observed GCs in our catalog NGC & 10. In addi-
tion, we re-analyze the kinematics of GC systems bound
to three brighter dEs found in the literature, VCC 1087,
VCC 1261, and VCC 1528 (Beasley et al. 2006, 2009).
Only the data set for VCC 1861 consists of NGC ∼ 20,
for the remaining ﬁve dEs NGC ∼ 10.

We apply two independent methods to measure the
amplitude of the rotation and the velocity dispersion of
the GC system. The ﬁrst method, RF, is based on ﬁrst
ﬁtting the rotation using a cosine function and then ob-
taining the velocity dispersion as the departure of the
GCs to the best ﬁt rotation curve. The second method,
RDSF, is based on a maximum likelihood statistical ap-
proach that simultaneously ﬁts the rotation amplitude,
using a cosine function, and the velocity dispersion of the
GC system. The rotation and velocity dispersion uncer-
tainties obtained in both methods are estimated using a
numerical bootstrap procedure. The kinematic proper-
ties of the GC systems measured using the RF and RDSF
methods are consistent within the error bars.

Toloba et al.

We evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the mea-
sured kinematics of the GC systems by creating artiﬁcial
non-rotating GC systems based on our data. We model
these non-rotating GC systems using two diﬀerent kinds
of simulations: velocity constrained simulations and ve-
locity unconstrained simulations. Both approaches are
tuned to reproduce as closely as possible the observed
GC systems, i.e. they have the same number of observed
GC satellites and the same median velocity uncertain-
ties.
In the case of VCC 1861, our largest GC system
(NGC = 18), the measured Vrot is consistent with zero
and these simulations of non-rotating systems coincide
with this measurement. This suggests that the GC sys-
tem of VCC 1861 is not rotating. The stellar rotation of
VCC 1861 is also consistent with zero (Toloba et al. 2011,
2014a). In the case of VCC 1528 (NGC = 10), the mea-
sured Vrot is between the 2σG and the 3σG contours of
these two kinds of simulated non-rotating systems. This
suggests that the GC system of VCC 1528 may be ro-
tating, and the measured Vrot = 67.9 ± 11.9 should be
considered an upper limit. However, a larger number of
GCs is needed to conﬁrm this result. The measured Vrot
and σGC in the remaining four target galaxies are be-
tween the 1σG and the 2σG contours of these two kinds
of simulated non-rotating systems, which indicates that
the measured kinematics are not statistically signiﬁcant.
We have found that measuring accurately the kinemat-
ics of dwarf galaxies based on their GC systems may
be more challenging than previously acknowledged. We
have carried out careful simulations to explore the pa-
rameters that help to make these measurements. We
ﬁnd that there are three key parameters: (1) the intrinsic
Vrot/σGC of the GC system, (2) the number of observed
GC satellites, and (3) the line-of-sight velocity uncertain-
ties. In all cases, Vrot tends to be overestimated and σGC
tends to be underestimated. However, these oﬀsets are
larger for GC systems with low Vrot/σGC values. Given
that Vrot/σGC is an unknown parameter, to obtain the
smallest rotation and dispersion oﬀsets, the number of
observed GC satellites should be NGC & 20. However,
many dwarf galaxies do not have such large numbers of
GCs, in those cases, the median velocity uncertainties
should be as small as possible (δVGC ≤ 2 km s−1), al-
though the oﬀsets cannot be reduced to 0. Thus, for data
sets with NGC . 10, the measured Vrot can be considered
an upper limit and the measured σGC a lower limit.

We conclude that the current observations, those pre-
sented in this paper and in the literature, need to be

improved, mainly in terms of number of GCs observed,
to be able to know whether these systems are rotating or
they are not. The current samples of GC satellites are
not complete, i.e. some GCs that appear close in pro-
jection to these dEs are not included in the observations
here and in the literature due to spatial slit conﬂicts, i.e.
they cannot be observed at the same time in the same
slitmask. New observations targeting these same galax-
ies including these not yet observed GCs would help to
address whether these dEs are rotating or not. A ma-
jor eﬀort is needed to have a database of dynamical halo
properties of Virgo cluster dEs to probe their formation
scenarios.

RADIAL VELOCITY MEASUREMENT AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THE GLOBULAR CLUSTERS

APPENDIX

The

radial

velocities

line-of-sight

are measured using

the penalized pixel-ﬁtting method (pPXF;
Cappellari & Emsellem 2004). This software ﬁnds the best ﬁt composite stellar template for the target galaxy. This
composite stellar template is created as a linear combination of high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N; 100 < S/N < 800 ˚A−1)
stellar templates that best reproduce the target object spectrum by employing non-linear least-squares optimization.
Each template is given a diﬀerent weight. To overcome the template mismatch that can cause signiﬁcant velocity
uncertainties, we observed 31 stars that are used as templates. These stars were observed with Keck/DEIMOS
using the same instrumental setup as described above. We used the LVMslits mask to observe these stars in a long
slit. They were also trailed across the slit to uniformly illuminate it. These templates include a variety of stellar
types, from B1 to M8, and luminosity classes, from supergiants to dwarfs, and also includes ﬁve carbon stars (see
Toloba et al. 2014a, for a comparison of the velocity dispersion measurements obtained using a large set of observed
stellar templates or stellar population models).

20

Toloba et al.

Unresolved sources can be oﬀ centered across the slit, thus their measured radial velocity diﬀers from the intrinsic
value in an amount that depends on the position of the target across the slit. This eﬀect can be corrected using the
atmospheric B and A bands at 6850 − 7020 ˚A and 7580 − 7690 ˚A, respectively, because those will be aﬀected by
the same velocity oﬀset. We ﬁt these two bands masking the rest of the spectrum and using the same procedure as
described for the target objects.

The radial velocity uncertainties are calculated by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. In each simulation, the
ﬂux of the spectrum is perturbed within a Gaussian function whose width is the uncertainty in the ﬂux obtained in
the reduction process. The radial velocity is measured in each simulation and their uncertainty is deﬁned to be the
standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution (1σG). All the radial velocity measurements and the Monte Carlo
simulations are visually inspected and only those with a Gaussian distribution shape are included in the analysis.

The ﬁnal radial velocity uncertainties are the square root of the quadratic addition of four components: (1) the
Monte Carlo radial velocity uncertainty of the target object; (2) the Monte Carlo radial velocity uncertainty of the A
and B atmospheric bands; (3) the uncertainty in the wavelength solution, which corresponds to 1.4 km s−1; and (4)
the uncertainty in the radial velocity of the templates, which is 0.4 km s−1. The stellar templates are not aﬀected by
the ghosting eﬀects that aﬀect the science spectra. The wavelength calibration error of the templates is smaller than
their radial velocity uncertainty.

We further asses the reliability of the velocity uncertainties by studying the agreement between the repeated mea-
surements of science targets. Fifteen of our objects in the full catalog of GCs and stars are observed in two diﬀerent
slitmasks. For each of these objects we calculate the diﬀerence between the duplicated velocities divided by the the
square root of the quadratic sum of their uncertainties. These diﬀerences follow a Gaussian distribution whose width
is unity, which means that both estimations of the velocity are within the error bars, indicating that the velocity
uncertainties are reliable.

RADIAL VELOCITY AND VELOCITY DISPERSION OF THE DES

Along with the GC candidates, we also placed a short slit in the slitmask targeting the centers of the dEs to measure
their line-of-sight radial velocity and velocity dispersion. These measurements and uncertainties are also estimated
using the pPXF software and following the same procedure as described in Section A.

Table 1 shows the line-of-sight radial velocity, i.e. systemic velocity Vsys, and the velocity dispersion measured in
the central region, σ0, of the dEs using pPXF. This central region corresponds to the extraction window described in
Section 2.2. The radius of this window, half its size, is indicated in Table 1 as R0.

The heliocentric corrected velocities for VCC 1539, VCC 1545, and VCC 1861 agree within the 1σG uncertainties

with the values measured by Gavazzi et al. (2003) and Toloba et al. (2014a).

The central velocity dispersions are only available in the literature for VCC 1545 and VCC 1861. While the values
agree within the 1σG uncertainties with those of Toloba et al. (2014a), they are 2.6 and 2.1 times smaller than those
measured by Chilingarian (2009) and Ry´s et al. (2013), respectively. The diﬀerence in the central velocity dispersion
between the measurement presented here and the one presented in Chilingarian (2009) could be due to the better
seeing of the data presented here, 0.6′′ − 0.9′′ (FWHM) versus 2.0′′, in combination with the possible kinematically
decoupled core that may be present in this galaxy. See Toloba et al. (2014a) for a detailed comparison between our
procedure to measure the velocity dispersion and the literature.
