We present ferromagnetic neutron spin echo measurements and muon spin relaxation (µSR) mea-
surements of the spin dynamics in the ordered phase of the metallic alloy INVAR Fe65Ni35. Both
techniques display evidence of slow spin dynamics in the ordered phase which could be associ-
ated with the INVAR eﬀect. Zero ﬁeld (ZF) and longitudinal ﬁeld µSR measurements suggest the
presence of two separate timescales of slow spin-dynamics in the ordered phase; a fast component
corresponding to that observed in our neutron-spin-echo measurements and a second slow compo-
nent which may be related to the “cluster” spin-ﬂuctuations or to the dynamics of disordered local
moments or both as suggested by previous neutron scattering measurements and recent theoretical
studies.

INTRODUCTION

In 1897 C. E. Guillaume established that face-centred-
cubic (fcc) alloys of iron and nickel with a concentration
of ∼35% nickel exhibit an anomalously small thermal ex-
pansion over a wide range of temperature1. He consid-
ered the expansion of these alloys to be invariable and
hence this eﬀect has since become known as the INVAR ef-
fect. This eﬀect has since been observed in various or-
dered and random alloys and in some metallic glasses - all
of which are ferromagnetic2. There is a wide range of ap-
plications in which INVAR alloys are used because of this
useful property; for example in the manufacture of pre-
cision scientiﬁc instruments, temperature regulators and
microwave resonators. Despite many years of study of the
INVAR eﬀect a clear understanding of the mechanism be-
hind this eﬀect is still lacking. INVAR behaviour is clearly
related to metallic ferromagnetism2,3. Below the Curie
temperature (Tc) typical coeﬃcients of linear expansion
observed in INVAR alloys have a value α (cid:39) 2.1 × 10−6,
while in their respective paramagnetic phases α increases
by one order of magnitude. An early attempt at a the-
oretical description of the INVAR eﬀect is the so–called
2γ–state model due to Weiss3. This model assumes the
co–existence of two near degenerate spin–states in f.c.c.
iron (γ-Fe): a high spin (HS), high volume state and a
low spin (LS), low volume state. Accordingly, thermal
spin–excitations from the HS state (labelled γ1) to the
LS, γ2 state leads to a loss of magnetisation on increas-
ing temperature with an associated volume contraction
which counteracts phononic thermal expansion.

Electronic band theory calculations conﬁrm the main
idea of the 2γ–state model. First–principles calcula-

tions of γ-Fe, randomly ordered Fe65Ni35 and ordered
Fe3Ni clearly show the existence of two stable magnetic
states, a low-spin, low-volume (LS) and a high-spin, high-
volume (HS) state4–6. In particular Entel et al. predicted
a change in the relative occupancy between the anti–
bonding t2g majority spin states and the non-bonding
eg minority spin states in favour of the latter as the tem-
perature increases4. This results in the contraction of
bonds, thereby counteracting thermal expansion. How-
ever, experimental conﬁrmation of the existence of two
spin states at ambient pressure in any INVAR material is,
so far, lacking. There is some evidence of closely spaced
spin–states in some metallic ferromagnets at high pres-
sure. Recent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements on Fe72Pt28 revealed that the system un-
dergoes a spin–state transition at an applied pressure of
4 GPa (40 kbar)7,8. Other X-ray diﬀraction measure-
ments have shown that the non-INVAR metallic ferro-
magnet Pd3Fe exhibits INVAR properties at high pres-
sure9. However, precise measurements of the magnetic
form factor (magnetisation distribution in k-space) in
Fe65Ni35 INVAR using polarized neutron diﬀraction10,11
in addition to magnetic X-ray Compton scattering ex-
periments12 show that the fraction of unpaired electrons
with eg symmetry remains constant in a range of temper-
ature from 100 K - 600 K, contradicting the theoretical
results of Entel et al.4 and eﬀectively ruling out the 2γ–
state model as a candidate description of the INVAR ef-
fect.

In the mid 1980s, there was an eﬀort by theorists such
as Moriya and co-workers to attempt to improve the
theoretical description of ﬁnite temperature properties
of metallic magnets - which are traditionally badly de-
scribed by simple Stoner models - using so-called self–

consistent–renormalisation (SCR) theory13. Here,
in-
stead of there being two near–degenerate electronic states
available to the system, spin ﬂuctuations give rise to a
manifold of continuously varying electronic states, result-
ing in a smoothly varying local magnetisation (cid:104)M 2
loc(T )(cid:105)
which increases monotonically as a function of tempera-
ture, with the precise details of the temperature depen-
dence determined by the structure and the occupation
of the bands. This temperature variation of (cid:104)M 2
loc(T )(cid:105)
then leads to a magneto–volume eﬀect consistent with
INVAR behaviour. This theory received some experi-
mental conﬁrmation from Ishikawa et al. 14 who used
neutron scattering to directly observe quasi–elastic mag-
netic neutron scattering associated with incoherent spin–
ﬂuctuations in the ordered state of Fe65Ni35, although
that study did not observe spin–ﬂuctuations in Fe3Pt.

Further modelling of the temperature dependence of
the thermal expansion coeﬃcient from magnetostriction
measurements15,16 using SCR theory showed a remark-
able level of agreement, though it was argued - no-
tably by Wohlfarth17 that the description of the pres-
sure dependence of the Curie temperature in these al-
loys was less successful. Motivated by the research of
the excitations responsible of the INVAR eﬀect, Ishikawa
et al. performed inelastic neutron scattering measure-
ments on the INVAR alloys Fe65Ni35 and Fe3Pt and
on non-INVAR Fe50Ni50. They observed that in IN-
VAR Fe65Ni35 and Fe3Pt spin wave excitations explain
only about a half of the temperature decrease of the
magnetization while this discrepancy is absent in non-
18,19. On the basis of their results they
INVAR Fe50Ni50
suggested that the variation in amplitude of the local
magnetic moment and then the INVAR eﬀect may be due
to the presence in these alloys of some hidden (unde-
tected) excitation. Nevertheless, to–date no other source
of magnetic excitations which may be responsible for
the INVAR eﬀect have been observed. Stoner excita-
tions appear at too high an energy ((cid:39) 100 meV) to be
responsible for the INVAR eﬀect19–22, while longitudinal
spin–ﬂuctuations are observed only in Fe65Ni35 and not
in Fe3Pt14.

More recent theoretical studies suggest that the IN-
VAR eﬀect is related to thermal magnetic disorder. Two
main models of magnetic disorder have been proposed;
the disordered local moment (DLM) picture23–27 and a
model incorporating non–collinear magnetic structures28.
Schilfgaarde et al. ﬁnd in INVAR concentrations of Fe–
Ni alloys a magnetic structure characterized, even at
zero temperature, by a continuous transition from a fer-
romagnetic state at high volumes to a disordered non-
collinear conﬁguration at low volumes28. This non-
collinearity gives rise to anomalies in the binding energy
volume dependence curve which is directly related to the
thermal expansion coeﬃcient through the bulk modu-
lus and Gr¨uneisen constant. Extensive polarized neutron
diﬀraction measurements have been undertaken to look
for non–collinear (and hence transverse) magnetism in
Fe65Ni35 but no sign of non–collinear ferromagnetism is

2

found29. However, an indication of the presence of non–
collinear moments has been conﬁrmed experimentally at
low momentum transfers30 in Fe65Ni35. On the basis
of this observation Menshikov et al. concluded that in
Fe65Ni35, non–collinear inhomogeneities are present on a
10 - 15 ˚A length scale. They suggested a model mag-
netic structure characterised by the occurrence of static
longitudinal spin ﬂuctuations embedded in a ferromag-
netic matrix31. Recent ab initio electronic structure cal-
culations based on the disordered local moment (DLM)
approach, give a good description of the INVAR eﬀect

in Fe65Ni35
These studies indicate that thermal magnetic disorder
(modelled as Ising spin–ﬂips in a local moment picture)
leads to INVAR behaviour. However, these models are
generally simplistic - assuming fully localised moments,
and often localised and randomised defects. More impor-
tantly, the DLM picture is lacking experimental justiﬁ-
cation (beyond the reproduction of the anomalous α(T )
behaviour).

In this study, we report on eﬀorts to look for low–
frequency spin–ﬂuctuations in Fe65Ni35 INVAR alloy us-
ing zero– and longitudinal–ﬁeld muon spin relaxation
(ZFµSR and LFµSR) and ferromagnetic neutron spin–
echo (FMNSE) measurements. Our motivation is to look
for low frequency spin–ﬂuctuations associated with ei-
ther disordered local moments or with disordered clus-
ters proposed by Menshikov and co–workers30,32. The
µSR technique is uniquely sensitive to small amplitude
magnetic inhomogeneities with ﬂuctuation rates on the
GHz timescale. FMNSE has inherently lower sensitivity
due to limitations of neutron beam ﬂux, but is able to
probe GHz timescale magnetisation dynamics, while si-
multaneously distinguishing a characteristic length scale
for the spin–ﬂuctuations.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The samples were prepared by melting appropriate
quantities of starting materials with purity of 99.99% in
an argon–arc furnace. The as–melted ingots were then
annealed at 800 oC for 72 hours followed by a slow cool.
The stoichiometry of the samples was veriﬁed by perform-
ing energy dispersive ﬂuorescence analysis using a com-
mercial scanning electron microscope. For the FMNSE
experiment a Fe65Ni35 sample with a mass of ∼ 100 g,
was studied using the spin–echo spectrometer IN11 at the
Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble. A saturating vertical
ﬁeld of 1 T was applied to align the magnetic domains
in the sample and hence preserve the neutron polariza-
tion. The temperature dependence of the intermediate
scattering function S(Q, t)/S(Q, 0) was measured using
neutron wavelength of λ = 5.5 ˚A at a scattering angle
2θ = 4◦. The ZFµSR measurements on Fe65Ni35 were
performed using the EMU muon spectrometer in “ﬂypast
mode” (a method to reduce the background)33 while the
LFµSR measurements were performed using the high–

ﬁeld HiFi spectrometer34, both at the ISIS neutron and
muon facility, Oxfordshire. The Fe65Ni35 sample was
mounted in the form of thin ﬂat solid plates on a sil-
ver sample holder placed in a closed cycle refrigerator
(CCR) allowing spectra to be taken over a wide temper-
ature range between 10 and 400 K.

In a µSR experiment there are several processes which
can contribute to muon depolarization. These include
the local ﬁelds from electronic and nuclear spins and, im-
portantly for metals, thermally activated hopping of the
muon between interstitial sites in the host crystal lattice.
If there is a uniform magnetic ﬁeld across the muon sites
in the crystal, then it is expected that the muons will
relax while oscillating with a frequency νi which is pro-
portional to the local ﬁeld value, νi = γµ|Bi|/2π, where
Bi is the average magnitude of the local ﬁeld at the ith
muon site and γµ is the muon gyromagnetic ratio.
In
INVAR it is expected that such a uniform internal ﬁeld is
too large to be detected by muon spectrometers at ISIS
which do not have suﬃcient frequency resolution to mea-
sure high frequency muon oscillations. Instead, a “1/3
tail” is normally seen, which, in a polycrystalline sample,
arises simply from the geometric constraint that 1/3 of
the moment lies along the initial muon polarisation and
therefore will not relax. The aim of this experiment was
to investigate any magnetic ﬂuctuations in this 1/3 tail
region and distinguish the relaxation from simple thermal
hopping. Such relaxation in the absence of muon hopping
would indicate slow magnetic ﬂuctuations in the ordered
regime - possibly associated with the INVAR eﬀect.

III. RESULTS

The intermediate scattering function S(Q, t)/S(Q, 0)
with Q (cid:39) 0.1 ˚A−1 measured from our FMNSE study is
plotted in Fig. 1 for three temperatures; 200 K, 320 K and
400 K. The advantage of spin–echo neutron spectroscopy
over conventional neutron spectroscopy is that the tech-
nique directly measures the time–dependent spin–spin
autocorrelation function S(t) over a range of so–called
Fourier times associated with the precession ﬁeld in the
spectrometer (see for example the review of Ehlers35).
In the FMNSE conﬁguration, IN11 is able to measure
over approximately one decade of time between 0.25 and
2.6 ns, and is therefore sensitive to spin–ﬂuctuations of
that order. The data shown in Fig. 1 were corrected
for instrumental resolution by dividing the data using a
low temperature run measured at 5 K. In Fig. 1 we see
that S(t) starts to decrease at long Fourier times above
∼1 ns indicating the presence of nanosecond timescale
spin–ﬂuctuations in Fe65Ni35. While this is in the up-
per reaches of the available time–range on IN11, it is
within the time–resolution of the instrument, and we note
that the characteristic spin–ﬂuctuation rate increases
systematically with temperature.
In order to give a
quantitative estimate of the timescale of the observed
spin–ﬂuctuations, the data were ﬁtted to a stretched–

ﬁnd relaxation times τ β of ∼22 ns, ∼34 ns and ∼45 ns at
400 K, 320 K and 200 K respectively. Since these spin–
ﬂuctuations are measured at a momentum transfer of
Q (cid:39) 0.1 ˚A−1 we can associate them with spin–clusters of
approximately 10 ˚A in extent. While the statistical qual-
ity of the measured S(t) does not permit a robust ﬁt, the
observed lineshape is evidently strongly non–exponential
in form.

A plot of the temperature dependence of the muon
relaxation spectra is shown in Fig. 2. Solid lines shown in
the ﬁgure represent ﬁts to the data of a phenomenological
two–component relaxation function,

G(t) = a1 exp(−λ1t) + a2 exp(−λ2t) + abg,

(1)

where ai are initial muon asymmetries for each ith com-
ponent, abg is a background time independent asymme-
try due to muons stopping in the silver sample holder
and CCR and λi are the muon relaxation rates. Figs. 3
and 4 show the temperature dependences of the ﬁtted
parameters from Eq. 1 to the ZFµSR data.

The background asymmetry abg was ﬁxed at a value of
0.025 - taken to be constant for all spectra as a function
of temperature. The zero ﬁeld µSR data was zero ﬁeld
cooled through the ordering temperature of INVAR below
which all the data presented was taken.

The presence of two muon relaxation rates suggests
the presence of two time–scales of magnetic ﬂuctuation.
Each time–scale is quite distinct, with a fast component
exhibiting relaxation rates between ∼1 and ∼10 MHz and

fast component, a1 (squares) and the slow component, a2

(i.e. the relaxation is too fast to be measured given the
ﬁnite ISIS muon pulse width33). At 320 K the fast com-
ponent is suddenly apparent in the data, with a sharp
increase in the total muon initial asymmetry a1 + a2 (see
inset Fig. 4). This is seen directly by the increase of the
t = 0 intercept in the measured G(t) at 320 K shown
in Fig. 2. λ1 then decreases steadily, ﬂattening out at a
value of ∼ 1MHz at ∼230 K. At the same temperature
there is a broad peak in the slow ﬂuctuation rate (λ2), as
well as a sharp increase in the initial asymmetry of the
slow component (a2). The initial asymmetry of the fast
component, a1, drops steadily with temperature, until
the disappearance of the fast component at T < 100 K.
The increase of the total asymmetry, shown in the inset of
Fig. 4 indicates the freezing out of the fast ﬂuctuations
at low temperatures. However it is clear from Figs. 2
and 3 and that there remain residual slow dynamics at
low temperatures ≤ 50 K.

In an attempt to conﬁrm that the measured relaxation
processes are magnetic in origin - rather than being due
to muon inter–site hopping, we also measured INVAR on
the HiFi spectrometer at ISIS in order to characterise
the ﬁeld dependence of the muon relaxation. We might
expect that application of a ﬁeld would have the eﬀect of
damping any spin–ﬂuctuations measured, thus suppress-
ing the observed relaxation channels, whereas, external
ﬁelds would be expected to have little eﬀect on the ﬁeld
distribution width at the muon site, and therefore if the
relaxation were due to muon inter–site hopping, this sig-
nal should remain on application of an external ﬁeld.

The muon relaxation spectra on application of a lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld can be successfully modelled us-
ing a single exponential relaxation component only. The

laxation rate due to the fast component (squares) drops into
the measureable range on EMU at 330 K and disappears at
just above 100 K at the point at which its associated initial
asymmetry tends to zero (see Fig. 4). The slow relaxation

sured.

a slow component with relaxation rates in the region of
∼0.03 to ∼0.2 MHz. At temperatures above 330 K and
below 100 K only the slow relaxation is observed. This is
due to the fact that at temperatures above 330 K the re-
laxation rates of the fast component (λ1) move out of the
resolution window of EMU and are no longer measurable

the ordered phase - and which may be due to low lying
spin–waves. As the temperature is lowered two sepa-
rate muon relaxation channels are observed, along with
the recovery of the “1/3 tail”. It is possible that some
the observed signal is due to thermally induced muon
hopping which eﬀectively dominates the muon depolar-
ization at high temperatures. However, we are conﬁdent
that both the slow and the fast relaxation channels are
largely magnetic in origin as the application of an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld alters the spin-ﬂuctuations in both
regimes as observed in our HiFi data.

The fast component of the spin dynamics may be asso-
ciated with conventional ordered–phase spin excitations
(spin–waves).
In conventional ferromagnets, a peak in
the muon relaxation rate at Tc is expected to occur be-
cause of critical spin ﬂuctuations around the phase transi-
tion. The increase of the fast component at around 250 K
may be the onset of this peak (Tc (cid:39)490 K for Fe65Ni35).
In order to check this, further µSR measurements could
be performed in a temperature range which spans Tc and
using an instrument sensitive to higher frequencies than
those measurable at the ISIS muon facilities. The spin
dynamics observed in the FMNSE measurement under an
applied ﬁeld of 1 T, should correspond to the fast compo-
nent observed in the LFµSR experiment. The slow com-
ponent has a characteristic time too long to be revealed
by IN11, and in any case, appears to be suppressed by
the application of a 1 T ﬁeld.

A relatively small ﬁeld decouples the muon relaxation
process from the slow magnetic ﬂuctuations, which may
be interpreted as an indication of muons stopping in
the silver sample support and depolarizing slowly due to
magnetic ﬁelds from the sample cutting into the silver.
Otherwise, the slow component may be associated with
the dynamics of non-collinear magnetic inhomogeneities
observed in INVAR Fe65Ni35 by Menshikov et al. using
neutron diﬀraction with polarization analysis30 and dif-
fuse neutron scattering32. On the basis of their results,
Menshikov et al. proposed a magnetic structure char-
acterized by frozen short–range longitudinal spin ﬂuctu-
ations perturbing the long–range ordered ferromagnetic
ground state.
In this picture, centres of such ﬂuctua-
tions are clusters of iron atoms surrounded by like atoms
in the nearest neighbour atomic shell. These ﬂuctua-
tions are due to the presence of antiferromagnetic iron-
pair interactions, JFe−Fe < 0, together with ferromag-
netic JNi−Ni > 0 and JNi−Fe > 0 as shown by previous
spin wave studies31. We postulate that such mixed inter-
actions could result in low–ﬁeld slow-ﬂuctuation muon
sites, where the muon relaxation would be slow. The
spatial extent of these atomic clusters is of the order of
10 - 12 ˚A corresponding to the Q–range measured in the
FMNSE experiment. So while the fast muon relaxation
component may be associated with spin waves the slow
component could be due to collective cluster dynamics
associated with Fe atomic clusters in Fe65Ni35. These
inhomogeneities seem to be related to the INVAR ef-
fect by dint of the fact that solid solutions far away

dinal ﬁeld of 0.5 T (blue circles), 1 T (yellow circles) and 2 T
(red circles).

extracted muon relaxation rates measured for ﬁelds of
0.5 T, 1 T and 2 T are plotted in Fig. 5. At each longitu-
dinal ﬁeld, the relaxation rate logarithmically decreases
from the highest measurable values on HiFi34 (like EMU,
around 10 MHz) to values of the order of between 0.1
and 0.01 MHz at low temperatures. This behaviour is
somewhat similar to that of the fast component in the
zero-ﬁeld measurements - with similar values of λ at
high temperature. Our data suggest that the fast spin–
ﬂuctuations appear to be damped with increasing ﬁeld,
resulting in an order–of–magnitude decrease of the relax-
ation rates between 0.5 T and 2 T, whereas there is no
sign of any residual slow relaxation at any temperature
for the longitudinal ﬁelds measured in this study.

We also carried out a ZFµSR and LFµSR study of
Fe60Ni40 - on the Ni-rich side of ideal INVAR stoichiom-
etry. The behaviour of the muon relaxation at this con-
centration was qualitatively identical to that of Fe65Ni35,
except that the temperature scale was slightly reduced,
with the peak in λ2 at 200 K instead of 230 K. The
timescales of the λ1 and λ2 relaxation channels was quan-
titatively identical.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our FMNSE measurements have detected the presence
of slow spin–ﬂuctuations at temperatures associated with
INVAR behaviour in Fe65Ni35. To conﬁrm the occurrence
of these spin ﬂuctuations we investigated INVAR with ZF
µSR. At 400 K there is no signiﬁcant relaxation, all the
muons are depolarised, including those expected in the
“1/3 tail” suggesting signiﬁcant magnetic ﬂuctuations in

neous ferromagnets without signiﬁcant atomic clustering
or non-collinear spin ﬂuctuations30,32.

It is also possible that the slow spin-ﬂuctuations ob-
served in our experiments could be associated with lo-
calised disordered spins, consistent with the DLM pic-
ture, or indeed with non-collinear spin-components ﬂuc-
tuating around the bulk magnetisation direction. Per-
haps more intriguingly, one could associate the presence
of two distinct timescales for muon relaxation with two
distinct Fe spin-states, according to the 2γ-state model.
Notably the temperature dependence of the fast and slow
relaxation components is broadly in line with the ex-
pected temperature dependence of the two spin–states
according to the work of Entel and co–workers4. How-
ever, we judge that the lack of direct evidence of the 2γ-
state model - either via magnetic form factor or magnetic
Compton scattering measurements10–12 - eﬀectively rules
out this picture. Indeed Entel himself admits in his paper
that while there is evidence of the HS and LS spin–states
merging at around Tc, this cannot explain the INVAR ef-
fect at temperatures well below Tc.

In the end analysis, it is possible to interpret our muon

data in the framework of many of the various theoretical
frameworks that have been used to explain the INVAR ef-
fect. What we can assert from the data we have pre-
sented is that we have observed unequivocal evidence of
slow spin–ﬂuctuations in the ferromagnetic ordered state,
measured with both muon and neutron spectroscopy, and
persisting over a wide range of temperatures. Further ex-
periments are now needed on non-INVAR concentrations
in order to demonstrate connection between these spin
ﬂuctuations and the INVAR eﬀect.
