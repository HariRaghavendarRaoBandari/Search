Abstract. The blazar 3C 279 exhibited a giant γ-ray outburst in 2013
December and 2014 April. Apart from the very fast γ-ray ﬂux variabil-
ity, the spectral nature of the ﬂares were also found to vary signiﬁcantly
between these two ﬂaring events. A prominent curvature in the γ-ray spec-
trum was noticed in 2014 April ﬂare, on the other hand, the 2013 December
displayed an extreme hardening of the spectrum. These observations, thus,
put strong constraints on our understanding of the underlying particle ac-
celeration mechanisms.

Introduction

The quasar 3C 279 (z = 0.536) was detected in a high state in 2013 December by
Fermi satellite. During this period, not only an extremely bright γ-ray ﬂare was ob-
served, but also the detected γ-ray spectrum was hard. In this work, this peculiar ﬂare
is studied.

2. Results and Conclusions

In the left panel of Figure 1, we compare the SEDs of 3C 279 covering the 2013
December and 2014 April ﬂares (hereafter F1 and F2, respectively). As can be seen,

Figure 1. Left: Comparison of the SEDs of 3C 279 at the peak of the ﬂares in 2013 December
(F1) and 2014 April (F2). Right: Time dependent lepto-hadronic model ﬁts to the SED of 3C
279.

the shape of the optical and X-ray SEDs remains same during both the ﬂares, but
what is more appealing is the change in the shape of γ-ray spectrum. In one zone
leptonic scenario, the shape of the synchrotron spectrum constrains the shape of the
high energy γ-ray radiation, assuming the same population of electrons are emitting
both emissions (see e.g., Sahayanathan & Godambe 2012). Accordingly, a falling
optical spectrum should correspond to the steep γ-ray spectrum, which is observed
in F2. However, a rising γ-ray spectrum, as seen during F1, is diﬃcult to explain
with this interpretation, since optical spectrum is declining. This observation indic-
ates that a single zone leptonic model cannot explain the hard γ-ray ﬂare detected in
F1. Therefore, we reproduce these peculiar observations following a time dependent
lepto-hadronic emission scenario described in Diltz, Böttcher & Fossati (2015). The
result of this modeling is shown in the right panel of Figure 1. The model ﬁrst reaches
the equilibrium (solid green line) and then injects a Gaussian perturbation to the input
parameters to reproduce the ﬂare (solid red line). The γ-ray data of the high state is
not ﬁtted very well, but keeping in mind that the input perturbations try to reproduce
the overall SED (including IR to X-ray spectra), we believe that the model is a good
representation of the data.

The multi-wavelength observations of 3C 279 during the twin γ-ray ﬂares have
revealed that F1 cannot be explained by one-zone radiative models and we need to
look for alternative approach such as lepto-hadronic modeling. These observations
hint for the presence of a variety of radiative processes working at diﬀerent activity
levels in the jet of 3C 279, of which, these two ﬂares are just an example.
