Degrees of Freedom of the MIMO 2 × 2

Interference Network with General Message

Sets

Yao Wang and Mahesh K. Varanasi, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract

We establish the degrees of freedom (DoF) region for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-transmitter,
two-receiver (2 × 2) interference network with a general message set, consisting of nine messages, one for each pair
of a subset of transmitters at which that message is known and a subset of receivers where that message is desired.
An outer bound on the general nine-message 2 × 2 interference network is obtained and then it is shown to be tight,
establishing the DoF region for the most general antenna setting wherein all four nodes have an arbitrary number of
antennas each. The DoF-optimal scheme is applicable to the MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with constant channel
coefﬁcients, and hence, a fortiori, to time/frequency varying channel scenarios.

In particular, a linear precoding scheme is proposed that can achieve all the DoF tuples in the DoF region. In it,
the precise roles played by transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment, random beamforming, symbol extensions
and asymmetric complex signaling (ACS) are delineated. For instance, we identify a class of antenna settings in
which ACS is required to achieve the fractional-valued corner points.

Evidently, the DoF regions of all previously unknown cases of the 2 × 2 interference network with a subset of
the nine-messages are established as special cases of the general result of this paper. In particular, the DoF region of
the well-known four-message (and even three-message) MIMO X channel is established. This problem had remained
open despite previous studies which had found inner and outer bounds that were not tight in general. Hence, the DoF
regions of all special cases obtained from the general DoF region of the nine-message 2×2 interference network of
this work that include at least three of the four X channel messages are new, among many others. Our work sheds
light on how the same physical 2 × 2 interference network could be used by a suitable choice of message sets to
take most advantage of the channel resource in a ﬂexible and efﬁcient manner.

I. INTRODUCTION

In order to design communication systems that can ﬂexibly and efﬁciently handle the complex signaling require-

ments of modern applications, such as in the delivery phase of caching systems over wireless interference channels,

it may be necessary to offer multiple physical layer modes that allow for the transmission of some or all of multiple

unicast, multiple multicast, multiple broadcast (i.e., X-channel), and/or cooperative/cognitive/common messages. In

this paper, rather than considering each such transmission mode in isolation, we study the uniﬁed setting in which

any subset (including all) such messages can be transmitted simultaneously over the MIMO 2 × 2 interference

network. For this simple network, depending on the subset of the two transmitters at which a message is known,

and the subset of the two receivers where it is desired, there are nine possible messages in the general message set.

For this fully general message set, the associated nine-dimensional DoF region of the MIMO 2 × 2 interference

network is established herein.

The most studied and also the best understood setting of the 2 × 2 interference network is the two-unicast setting,

referred to in the literature as the interference channel [2], in which each transmitter has a private message for its

single distinct intended receiver (cf. [3], [4], [5] and the references therein). In particular, the DoF region of the

two-user MIMO interference channel was found in [3] and more reﬁned characterizations in terms of generalized

degrees of freedom and constant bit-gap to capacity were found in [4] and [5], respectively.

The four private message case, which can be thought of as a two-broadcast network, more commonly known as

the X channel, allows for the transmission of a private message to each of the two receivers from each transmitter.

The now well-known, and more broadly applicable, linear precoding technique known as interference alignment is

needed to achieve the DoF in some cases. With its use, the MIMO X channel was shown in [6], [7] to achieve

higher sum DoF than the MIMO interference channel. For example, when all transmitters and receivers are equipped

MIMO X channel can achieve a sum DoF of 4

with the same number, M , of antennas, the two-user MIMO interference channel has a sum DoF of M , while the
3 M for M > 1, achievable with interference alignment. The key idea
(when M is a multiple of 3) is that by aligning undesired signals (i.e., interference) from the two transmitters into

the same subspace at a receiver, one can maximize the desired signal dimensions at that receiver. In [7], an outer

bound on the DoF region of the MIMO X channel is given based on the sum rate outer bound of the embedded

MAC, BC and Z channels in the X channel. Moreover, [7] gives an achievability scheme based on interference

alignment and presents an achievable DoF region that is given as the convex hull of all integer-valued degrees of

freedom within that outer bound region. But these inner and the outer bounds of [7] are not identical. However,

using interference alignment over multi-letter extensions of the MIMO X channel, it was shown that the outer bound

is tight (including non-integer corner points) when all nodes have equal number of antennas M , when M > 1. In

the context of the general MIMO X channel with an arbitrary numbers of antennas at the four terminals, [7] claims

that the DoF outer bound region obtained therein is tight in “most cases”, but a precise statement and proof of this

claim is not provided. Later, the authors of [8] introduced a novel technique named asymmetric complex signaling

(ACS). By allowing the inputs to be complex but not circularly symmetric and using an alternative representation

of the channel models in terms of only real quantities, the problem is transformed to delivering real messages

over channels with real-valued coefﬁcients. Consequently, it was shown that the 2-user single-input, single-output
3 DoF. However, it remained an
open problem as to whether the outer bound of [7] is tight for any of the multiple antenna cases. For instance,

(SISO) X channel with constant channel coefﬁcients achieves the outer bound of 4

the problem remained open as to whether there are other scenarios in which ACS is required in addition to multi-

letter extensions, as did the problem of identifying cases in which just multi-letter extensions sufﬁce to achieve the

outer bound. More recently, it was shown in [9] that the outer bound on the sum DoF for the MIMO X channel

(with generic channel coefﬁcients) derived in [7] is tight for any antenna conﬁguration. The work in [9] proposes

a linear precoding method based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), and with the aid of

computational experiments, the authors of [9] offer a conjecture that the outer bound region obtained in [7] is also

tight. The general DoF region result of this paper for the MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with nine distinct

messages, when specialized to the four private-message MIMO X channel, settles this conjecture in the afﬁrmative.

It therefore also expands on, and makes precise, the claim in [7]. The outer bound on the DoF region of [7] is

indeed tight.

Besides the aforementioned MIMO interference and X channels (and its embedded MAC and/or BC), in which

only private messages are considered (see also [4], [5], [10]), the 2 × 2 interference network can work in various

other modes if common messages, multicast messages and/or transmitter cognition are allowed. For example, if both

transmitters share the same three messages, and each receiver demands one of the ﬁrst two messages while both

demand the third, we have what is known as the broadcast channel with private and common messages (BC-CM)

[11], [12]. On the other hand, if each transmitter has a private message, and both receivers demand both of the

messages, the system works as a compound multiple access channel (C-MAC) [13]. If there are two private messages

as in the interference channel and there is a common message known by both transmitters and also demanded by

both receivers, the network is known as the interference channel with common message (IC-CM) [14], [15]. The

network is referred to as a cognitive X channel in [7] if there are four independent messages to be sent as in the

X channel, but with one of the four messages known at both transmitters. A new three-message setting could be

deﬁned in which one transmitter has 2 messages, each intended for a distinct receiver, and a third shared message

that is known to both transmitters and desired at one of the receivers. Interpreting the second transmitter as a relay,

such a setting could be described as a broadcast channel with a partially cognitive relay (BC-PCR). A six-message

cognitive X channel could be deﬁned as having the four private messages as in the X channel as well as two more

messages that are known to both transmitters with each desired at a distinct receiver. Evidently, based on different

message sets, the 2 × 2 interference network can represent many different settings and potential applications.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider the complex Gaussian network with two transmitters and two receivers, as it is shown in Figure 1.

The two transmitters are equipped with M1, M2 antennas respectively, and the two receivers are equipped with N1,
N2 antennas respectively. We denote the channel between transmitter t and receiver r as the Nr ×Mt complex matrix
Hrt and assume all channels to be generic, i.e., all the channel coefﬁcient values are drawn independently from

a continuous probability distribution. The channel is assumed to be constant over the duration of communication

and all channel coefﬁcients are perfectly known at all transmitters and receivers. The received signal at receiver

r (r = 1, 2) is given by Yr = Hr1X1 + Hr2X2 + Zr, where Xt (t = 1, 2) is the Mt × 1 input vector at transmitter
t, Zr is the Nr × 1 additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector at receiver r.

General message sets are considered in this paper. For 2 × 2 interference network, there are at most nine possible

messages classiﬁed by different sources and destinations. We index them as W11, W12, W21, W22, W01, W02, W0,
W1 and W2, as shown in Figure 1. Wrt (r, t = 1, 2) is a private message sent from transmitter t to receiver r;
W0r (r = 1, 2) is a common message transmitted cooperatively from both transmitters to receiver r; Wt (t = 1, 2)
is a multicast message transmitted from transmitter t and demanded by both receivers simultaneously; W0 is a
common multicast message transmitted cooperatively from both transmitters and demanded by both receivers.

Assume the total power across all transmitters to be equal to ρ and indicate the message set size by |W (ρ)|. For

codewords occupying t0 channel uses, the rates R(ρ) = log|W (ρ)|
nine messages can simultaneously be made arbitrarily small by choosing appropriately large t0. The capacity region

where E = {11, 12, 21, 22, 01, 02, 1, 2, 0}.

This deﬁnition is the general message set counterpart of the one provided in [7] for the MIMO X channel. Note

that D is a closed convex set.

In the following section, we consider ﬁrst the previously studied MIMO X channel, for which the best inner

and outer bounds of [7], [8], [9] known to date are not coincident in general. The MIMO X channel provides the

context in which to introduce the notation used in this paper and all the relevant linear precoding techniques, namely,

zero-forcing, interference alignment, symbol extension, and ACS. We provide a class of antenna conﬁgurations for

which, among linear schemes, ACS is required and is sufﬁcient, along with multi-letter extensions and the other

linear precoding techniques, to achieve all fractional DoF corner points for those antenna conﬁgurations. More

generally, we show that the use of linear precoding techniques including symbol extensions and ACS, whether

ACS is required or not, are sufﬁcient to achieve any corner point of the DoF region regardless of the antenna

conﬁguration. The DoF region of the general nine-message problem is established in IV.

III. THE MIMO X CHANNEL

The MIMO X channel is an important special case of the 2 × 2 interference network in which only the four

private messages, namely, W11, W12, W21, W22, are present. Hence the message index set in this case is E =
{11, 12, 21, 22}. Each of these four messages is intended for one of the two receivers and is a source of interference

to the other receiver.

We start by stating the DoF region of the MIMO X channel.

Theorem 1. The DoF region of the MIMO X channel with constant generic channel coefﬁcients is (with probability

one)

DX = {(d11, d21, d12, d22) ∈ R4

+ :

d11 + d12 + d21 ≤ max(M1, N1),

d11 + d12 + d22 ≤ max(M2, N1),

d21 + d22 + d11 ≤ max(M1, N2),

d21 + d22 + d12 ≤ max(M2, N2),

d11 + d12 ≤ N1, d21 + d22 ≤ N2,

d11 + d21 ≤ M1, d12 + d22 ≤ M2}.

That the above DoF region is an outer bound for the DoF region of the MIMO X channel is proved in Theorem

2 of [7]. The outer bounding inequalities result, respectively, from the embedded multiple-access channel, broadcast

channel and Z channels, in the MIMO X channel. The readers can refer to [7] for details. Moreover, these outer

bounds are generalized to the general nine-message problem in Section V.

The authors of [7] also provide a constructive achievability proof to show that the convex hull of all the integer-

valued DoF-tuples in DX is achievable. The techniques used in the achievable scheme are zero-forcing, interference

alignment and random beamforming. Since these techniques are among the techniques used in our 2×2 interference

network with general message sets problem, we provide a succinct account of them in Section III-A, describing in

the process, the notation used in this paper as well. The techniques of symbol extension and ACS are described in

Sections III-B and III-C to follow.

A. Zero-forcing and interference alignment

Consider message W11 as an example. If M1 > N2, the null space of channel H21 is not empty. By transmitting
some symbols of message W11 using the beamformers chosen from the null space N (H21), we can zero-force
these symbols at receiver R2 and thus introduce no interference to it. The maximum number of such symbols that
can be zero-forced is (M1 − N2)+, which is equal to the rank of N (H21). Similarly, we can transmit, at most,
(M2 − N2)+ symbols of message W12 via the nullspace of channel H22 and zero-force them all at their unintended
receiver, R1. Note that the null space N (H21) and N (H22) are both subspaces of the null space of the concatenated
channel [H21 H22]. The remaining dimension of N ([H21 H22]) is equal to A = (M1 + M2 − N2)+ − (M1 −
N2)+ − (M2 − N2)+. By choosing beamformers for message W11 and W12 jointly from the rest of the subspace of
N ([H21 H22]), it is possible to align this part of message W11 and W12 into the same subspace and thus reserve
more dimensions for the desired messages at receiver R2, and the maximum number of such pairs of streams is
equal to A. If there are more symbols of message W11 left, they can be transmitted using random beamforming,
which would create unavoidable interference at its unintended receiver.

Since the technique of zero-forcing is the more efﬁcient in terms of reducing interference than interference

alignment, it is given the highest priority when constructing precoding beamformers. Following that, interference

alignment is used to the extent possible, and following which all of the remaining symbols are sent using random

beamforming. The beamformers for each private message is hence divided into three linearly independent parts

based on the precoding technique used. Here we use superscript ’Z’ to indicate a message is zero-forced at its

unintended receiver, ’A’ to indicate a message is aligned with another interference at their commonly unintended

receiver, and ’R’ to indicate the remainder of a certain message that is transmitted using random beamforming.

three components or sub-messages, denoted W Z

Hence a message Wx for x ∈ E (recall E = {11, 12, 21, 22} for the MIMO X channel) is split in general into
x , with the number of symbols (dimensions) in each
x with x ∈ E and y ∈ {Z, A, R}
for the component messages and dimensions, respectively. Similarly, the precoding matrix for any sub-message W y

B. Symbol extensions

When a corner point of DX is not integer-valued, it is rational-valued. It is therefore natural to consider a multi-

letter extension of the channels to obtain a larger but equivalent system with the corresponding corner point of the

DoF region being integer-valued. The length of symbol extensions can be chosen to be the least common multiple

of the denominators of all the fractional values. To this time-extended channel, the techniques of zero-forcing,

alignment and random beamforming can be applied as described in the previous section. This was proposed in [7].

Consider T symbol extensions of the X channel with complex and constant (across time) channel coefﬁcients.

We have the equivalent eNi ×fMj channel matrix eHij, in which i, j = 1, 2, fMi = T · Mi, eNi = T · Ni, and

(1)

Hence, we effectively have an X channel with fMj antennas at the jth transmitter and eNi antennas at the ith
receiver and channel matrices eHij ∈ C eNi×fMj . To achieve a degrees of freedom tuple

d for this equivalent system, and we can use the exact same precoding scheme designed

−→
d for the original system,

we need to achieve T ·

for integer-valued corner points.

However, the equivalent channel matrices after symbol-extension are unlike those for their original counterparts

(with T = 1) in that they are block-diagonal. The primary question that arises is whether the the channel matrices of

the time-extended channel continue to yield the linear independence results of the single-letter generic unstructured

channels in spite of their special non-generic structure. If they do, then it can be asserted that multi-letter extensions

are sufﬁcient to achieve all fractional DoF tuples of DX.

However, this is not the case in general. Indeed, as it was observed in [7] the symbol extension technique is not

sufﬁcient even for the SISO X channel. Interestingly, on the other hand, it is shown in [7] that, in the symmetric

MIMO case, where all nodes have equal number, M , of antennas, and M > 1, the same idea works.

Nevertheless, the authors of [7] claim, based on a few examples, that the DoF outer bound region obtained

therein is tight in “most cases”, and give the SISO case as an exception. But it is not clear if there are other cases

that are also such exceptions, and if so, whether they can indeed be seen as exceptions, i.e., it is unclear as to

how commonly these exceptions arise, in which just symbol extensions are not enough to achieve all the fractional

corner points of DX. This brings us to the next section.

C. Asymmetric Complex Signaling

As stated previously, since the equivalent channel matrices after symbol-extension will be block-diagonal, many

nice properties of the original generic channels can be lost. It is shown in [7] that, in the SISO case, the precoding

March 8, 2016

DRAFT

8

scheme provided previously (with three symbol extensions) fails to achieve the important integer-valued corner point

(1, 1, 1, 1) which achieves sum-DoF, because of the block diagonal structure in the extended channel matrices.

In response to this phenomenon, the authors of [8] introduced a new technique named asymmetric complex

signaling (ACS). The key idea of ACS is to allow the inputs to be complex but not circularly symmetric and use

an alternative representation of the channel models in terms of only real quantities. All dimensions of the new

system will be doubled and all channel coefﬁcients, beamformers, inputs and outputs will be real-valued. Let Hij

(i, j = 1, 2) be the original complex channel matrices, their alternative real representations will have the following

forms

−→

streams over the equivalent real channels.

It is shown in [8] that using ACS, the outer bound of 4

3 degrees of freedom is achievable for the SISO X channel.
In particular, with a three-symbol extension and ACS, all equivalent channel matrices are of size 6 × 6, and using

the same precoding scheme as used in the other MIMO cases, two real-valued symbols can be transmitted via

the real channels. The missing independence requirement in the previous complex-valued transmission disappears

almost surely in this new model. Thus the sum-DoF of 4/3 is achievable (and hence also the DoF region). The

readers are referred to [8] for further details.

D. Closing the gap

The important question as to whether there are MIMO antenna conﬁgurations for which, among linear schemes

including symbol extensions, ACS is necessary, remains open. The question is also open about whether ACS, along

with the other linear techniques, is sufﬁcient for MIMO antenna conﬁgurations to achieve all fractional DoF-tuples

in DX. If so, for what antennas conﬁgurations is it sufﬁcient? Are there DoF-tuples and antenna conﬁgurations for

which linear precoding schemes including time extensions and ACS are not sufﬁcient?

In this section, all of the above questions are deﬁnitively answered. In particular, a class of antenna conﬁgurations

(that includes the SISO case) are identiﬁed that require ACS among linear schemes; i.e., in which just employing

symbol extensions alone doesn’t sufﬁce. More generally, it is shown that ACS along with the other linear schemes

is sufﬁcient to achieve any fractional corner points of the DoF region DX of the MIMO X channel for any antenna

conﬁguration.

Lemma 1. In the case that M1 + M2 = N1 + N2 and min(M1, M2, N1, N2) = 1, if interference alignment is
needed to achieve any fractional DoF-tuple in DX, then the achievability scheme in III-A, applied to the T -symbol

extended 2 × 2 interference network, fails to make the corresponding symbols distinguishable at the receiver where

they are desired. In particular, if M1 or N2 = 1, then span(cid:16)eH21eV A

zero-forcing any symbol of message W21 and W22 at receiver R1 is not possible, i.e., eV Z

First, consider the situation when N2 = 1, and we have that N1 = M1 + M2 − 1 ≥ max(M1, M2). Consequently,
21 = ∅. However,
since M1 + M2 − N1 = 1, there exists a one dimensional null space of the concatenated channel [H11 H12]. Thus,
it is possible to align one symbol of message W21 with one symbol of message W22 at receiver R1. When T
channel extensions are used, the available dimension for interference alignment is equal to T . Suppose the basis
vector of the null space of N ([H11 H12]) is given by1

Next, consider the situation when M1 = 1. In this case, M1 ≤ N1 and M2 = N1 + N2 − 1 ≥ N1. In other
words, the null space of channel H11 does not exist, and the null space of channel H12 may exist. Recall that
we only do interference alignment after zero-forcing of more symbols is not possible. Thus, when interference

alignment is used, M2 − N1 streams of the message W22 have already been zero-forced at receiver R1. Since

Remark 1. The authors of [8] introduced ACS in the context of the SISO X channel and showed that the total
3 can be achieved in that channel. In this paper, we provided a new and simpliﬁed perspective on how
ACS works. In particular, it transforms the previous scalar multiplication to a local vector rotation, thus obviating

the unexpected linear dependences among all the beamformers. Using this we broaden its applicability to MIMO

X channel, and more generally, ia a later section, to the nine-message MIMO 2×2 interference network.

Remark 2. For all the other antenna settings not included in the cases given in Lemma 1, there is no unexpected

loss of independence of desired messages when doing symbol extensions. Thus, ACS is not necessary in those

cases.

E. Further results on the MIMO X channel

In this section, we discuss several other observations/results about the MIMO X channel.

Lemma 3 is a special case of Theorem 1. In terms of sum-DoF performance, there are hence redundant antennas

2 . In the case that M = N , the redundancy exists both at the transmitters and at the receivers. For
example, the three antenna settings of (3, 3, 3, 3), (3, 3, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 3, 3) all have the same maximum sum-DoF

of 4.

Interestingly, for the equal-antenna case of (3, 3, 3, 3), one can easily achieve the DoF-tuple of (1, 1, 1, 1) by

turning off one antenna at each receiver and then transmitting all four symbols of the private messages using

zero-forcing beamforming in each of the one-dimensional null space of the remaining channel matrices. No explicit

interference alignment is actually needed to achieve the optimal sum-DoF. Given that explicit interference alignment

was ﬁrst discovered in the context of the symmetric three-antenna MIMO X channel as being the key ingredient [7]

needed to achieve DoF-optimality, this observation is surprising. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the

ﬁrst time this simple result has been noted. Shutting down the redundant antenna at each receiver could however be

seen as implicitly aligning interference in a subspace that would only be seen by that antenna and then discarding

that subspace.

Lemma 4. For the special cases given in Lemma 1, in which ACS is required to achieve the maximum sum-DoF,
3 , where C = M1 +M2 = N1 +N2. The DoF tuple to achieve the maximum

the maximum sum-DoF is equal to C − 2

sum-DoF is given by dij = min(Mj, Ni) − 2
3 .

Proof: We give the proof for the case that M1 = min(M1, M2, N1, N2) = 1 here. The other cases follow in

the same way.

Since M1 = 1 and M1 + M2 = N1 + N2 = C, we have that max(M1, N1) = N1, max(M1, N2) = N2,

max(M2, N1) = M2 and max(M2, N1) = M2. Adding the ﬁrst 4 inequalities in DX together, we have that

3(d11 + d12 + d21 + d22) ≤ N1 + N2 + 2M2 = 3C − 2

Thus, the sum-DoF is bounded by C − 2

3 (i, j = 1, 2)
achieves the optimal sum DoF and is within the DoF region DX . Thus, the maximum sum DoF is equal to C − 2
3 .

3 . It is easy to verify that the DoF tuple dij = min(Mj, Ni)− 2

A symbol extension of length 3, together with ACS, is required to achieve this corner point.

Lemma 5. In the case that only three private messages are transmitted in the channel, all the corner points will

be integer-valued. Thus, neither symbol extension nor ACS is necessary.

March 8, 2016

DRAFT

Proof: Since the channel is isotropic with respect to any message, we can assume without loss of generality

that the three private messages are W11, W12 and W21. By deleting d22 from DX and removing the redundant
inequalities, we obtain the following 3-dimensional DoF region.

Each corner point of this 3-D region will be the intersection of three of the nine facets describing the polytope.

Observing the constraints, it is easy to verify that the only possible combination of facets that can have a fractional

intersection are (9), (10) and (11), and the corresponding vertex is

d11 = M1+N1−max(M2,N2)

From constraint (8), we have that

M1 + N1 + max(M2, N2)

≤ max(M1, N1).

Otherwise, this corner point will be outside the DoF region. Consequently, one of d12 and d21 will be ≤ 0. If it
is less than zero, this corner point is outside the DoF region and therefore irrelevant; if it is equal to 0, then the

other two values will be integers.

The intersection of all other combinations of facets will be integer-valued, thus, all the corner points of D

′ are

integer-valued, and neither symbol extension nor ACS are necessary to achieve them.

Lemma 6. For the MIMO X channel of an arbitrary antenna setting, if there are fractional-valued corner points

and symbol extension is required to achieve this corner point, the length of symbol extension will be at most 3.

Proof: Again, each corner point of the 4-dimensional DoF region is the intersection of four of the facets

describing the polytope. Since the coefﬁcients of any facet are either 0 or 1, any selected 4-by-4 coefﬁcient matrix

will be a binary matrix. According to the Hadamard maximal determinant problem [16], the determinant of an

order 4 binary matrix can at most be 3. Consequently, the inverse of any 4-by-4 coefﬁcient matrix, if it exists, can

March 8, 2016

at most have a denominator of 3. Thus, for any non-integer valued corner points, the denominator will be at most

3. Thus, the length of symbol extension will be at most 3.

More speciﬁcally in this problem, it is shown that there is only one corner point whose denominator is 3, and

this corner point is the intersection of the four facets corresponding to the ﬁrst four constraints in DX.

F. Cognitive MIMO X channel

If one of the four private messages in the MIMO X channel, for example W11, is made available non-causally
at the other transmitter, the channel is named cognitive MIMO X channel. It is shown in [7] that the sum DoF
2 M , which is
3 M of the symmetric X channel. So, cognitive message sharing helps increase sum

of the cognitive MIMO X channel with equal number, M , of antennas at each terminal is equal to 3

greater than the sum DoF of 4

DoF in this case. We discuss more general properties of the cognitive MIMO X channel here.

Theorem 2. The degrees of freedom region of the cognitive MIMO X channel with message W21, W12, W22 and
W01 is given by

Dco−X =(cid:8)(d01, d21, d12, d22) ∈ R4

+ :

d01 + d12 + d21 ≤ max(M1, N1),

d01 + d12 + d22 ≤ max(M2, N1),

d21 + d22 + d12 ≤ max(M2, N2),

d01 + d12 ≤ N1, d21 + d22 ≤ N2,

d21 ≤ M1, d12 + d22 ≤ M2,

Theorem 2 follows directly from our main result of the 9-dimensional DoF region of the MIMO 2 × 2 Gaussian

d01 + d21 + d12 + d22 ≤ M1 + M2(cid:9)

interference network with general message sets given in Section IV. When the above DoF region is specialized

to the symmetric, equal-antenna case, all but the ﬁrst three bounds are redundant, and it is easy to see that the

DoF-tuple (d01 = M/2, d12 = 0, d21 = M/2, d22 = M/2), the achievability of which was shown in [7] for M > 1
(using two-symbol extensions), is a maximum sum-DoF corner point of Dco−X for any M ≥ 1.

More generally, the DoF region of cognitive MIMO X channel is in general greater than that of the MIMO X

channel. For example, consider the case of M1 = 3, M2 = 4, N1 = 5, N2 = 6. When d12, d21 and d22 are all set
to be equal to 1, d11 can be at most 2 in the MIMO X channel, whereas d01 can be up to 3 in the cognitive MIMO
X channel. Even the cognition of one message among the transmitters can signiﬁcantly improve the maximum

achievable DoF.

Lemma 8. In the case that M1 + M2 = N1 + N2 and min(M1, M2, N1, N2) = 1, among linear strategies, ACS
is required to achieve the DoF region of the cognitive MIMO X channel.

Proof: The reason that ACS is necessary for the cognitive MIMO X channel is the same as that for the MIMO

X channel in lemma 1. We omit the details for brevity

Lemma 9. For the special cases given in Lemma 8, in which ACS is required to achieve the maximum sum-DoF of

the cognitive MIMO X channel, the maximum sum-DoF is equal to C − 1

easily verify that the two given DoF tuples are both within Dco−X and achieve the maximum sum-DoF.

A symbol extension of length 2, together with ACS, is required to achieve this corner point.

There can be two non-integer-valued corner points which achieve the maximum sum-DoF. However, when

min(M1 + M2, N1) = min(M1, N1), or equivalently M1 ≥ N1, these two corner points are the same. If these
two corner points are different, we can get one of them from the other by just regarding the non-zero d12 symbols
of message W12 as part of message W01.

Lemma 10. For the cognitive MIMO X channel of arbitrary antenna setting, if there are any fractional-valued

corner point and symbol extensions are required to achieve this corner point, the length of symbol extension will

be at most 2.

Proof: Although the determinant of an arbitrary 4-by-4 binary matrix can be at most 3, it is easy to verify

that the maximum determinant of any 4-by-4 coefﬁcient matrix generating from any four facets given in Dco−X is
equal to 2. Thus, the length of symbol extension will be at most 2.

Now, let us consider the general MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with nine messages.

The techniques used here are transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment and random beamforming.

The nine messages are divided into three groups as shown in Table I. Group 1 consists of the four point-to-point

private or X-channel messages {W11, W12, W21, W22}, Group 2 consists of the cognitive and common messages
which are known to both transmitters, namely, {W01, W02}. Group 3 consists of the remaining three multicast

X channel. Then, the other two groups are transmitted via the channel resources still available. Recall that, for

These values are pre-determined according to the value of the DoF tuple and the system antenna setting. They

naturally follow from the fact that the numbers of beamformers transmitted using zero-forcing or interference

alignment cannot exceed the corresponding available null space dimensions. For the four private messages, if zero-

forcing is possible, use zero-forcing ﬁrst. If there are more streams that must be send, use interference alignment

next. If there are still more streams after running out of the possibility of doing alignment, use random beamforming.

For the two cognitive and common messages, if there are residual available null space dimensions, transmit using

zero-forcing; otherwise, just use random beamforming. For three multicast messages, all streams are transmitted

using random beamforming.

The key to using zero-forcing or interference alignment is to appropriately utilize the beamformers picking from

the null space of corresponding channels. For a generic channel matrix Hn×m (n < m), the dimension of its
nullspace is equal to m − n. To obtain a basis of N (H), we can do a singular value decomposition (SVD) of

matrix H while arranging the singular values in non-increasing order. Then, the last m − n right-singular column

vectors, which are corresponding to singular value 0, will form a basis of N (H). We construct matrix Φ(H)

such that its column vectors are equal to these basis vectors of N (H). Let matrix X(m−n)×a denote a randomly
(m − n) × a matrix, whose column vectors are generated independently from a uniform distribution on a m − n

dimensional sphere of radius 1. Then, Φ(H)·X(m−n)×b will generate b random combinations of these basis vectors.
If b ≤ m − n, these b vectors will be linearly independent of each other almost surely.

Now, construct the beamformers for all 9 messages according to the equations (32)-(38) listed below.

(cid:4)

Remark 3. In linear beamforming, to achieve Din , only the techniques of zero-forcing, interference alignment and
random beamforming are required. Furthermore, as is shown later in Section VI, interference alignment is needed

only among the four private X channel messages, i.e., aligning W11 with W12 at receiver R2 or aligning W21 with
W22 at receiver R1. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, it is not necessary to align interference due to any part of W01
with that due to W11 or W12 at receiver R2, or to align interference due to any part of W02 with that due to W21
or W22 at receiver R1.

Remark 4. In the construction of V Z

0i , we use the random linear combinations of the basis vectors of
the nullspace of corresponding channels, instead of directly picking beamformers from those basis vectors obtained

through an SVD. The advantage is that it avoids picking a same basis vector repetitively in following procedures

and potentially leading to unexpected dependence among the beamformers.

Lemma 12. The fractional numbers at the boundary of D, i.e., the gap between Din and D, can be achieved using
appropriate length of symbol extension. In the case that M1 + M2 = N1 + N2 and min(M1, M2, N1, N2) = 1,

ACS is required in addition to symbol extension.

Proof: To achieve a DoF tuple

d is integer-valued. The problem of unexpected dependencies, which is brought on by the structured channel

matrices after symbol extensions, also exists here in the nine-message problem. The random beamforming part of

0i and W R

messages in Groups 2 and 3, i.e., W R

k (i = 1, 2, k = 0, 1, 2), cause no problem; they behave the same
ij (i, j = 1, 2) from Group 1 in terms of independence results. Since the beamformers for the zero-forcing
0i (i = 1, 2), are generated from the null space of corresponding concatenated
channels, they face the same situation as the interference alignment beamformer pairs (of the private messages) do.

as do W R

part of Group 2 messages, i.e., W Z

Since all the zero-forcing and interference alignment beamformers are derived from the same source but belong to

different messages, their behaviors are actually equivalent when considering independence results. The analyses of

when ACS is necessary and how ACS works which were detailed in Section III for the the MIMO X channel are

the same as in the MIMO X channel problem as well.

In summary, Lemmas 11 and 12 establish that D is an inner bound to the DoF region of the 2 × 2 interference

network. Together with the proof of the outer bound in Section V, this completes the proof of Theorem 3.

V. OUTERBOUND ON THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM REGION

In this section, we prove the converse part of Theorem 3, i.e., that the region D is an outer bound for the DoF

region of the 2 × 2 interference network.

First, the outer bound (22) comes from the MIMO point-to-point channel outer bound when cooperation between

transmitters and receivers are both allowed.

Second, consider the embedded multiple-access channel which only contains transmitters T1 and T2 and receiver
R1. In this situation, message W02, W21, W22 are irrelevant and set to ∅ to avoid interference. The original message
W1 will degenerate to W11, since we don’t require W1 to be decoded by receiver R2. Similarly, W2 will degenerate
to W12, and W0 will degenerate to W01. The cut-set bound for multiple-access channel with common message is
ˆd01 + ˆd11+ ˆd12 ≤ N1. Hence in this scenario, we get the equivalent outer bound (d0 +d01)+(d1 +d11)+(d2 +d12) ≤

March 8, 2016

22

N1, which is outer bound (18). In the same way, we get outer bound (19) by considering the embedded multiple-
access channel which only contains transmitter T1 and T2 and receiver R2.

Third, consider the embedded broadcast channel which only contains transmitter T1 and receivers R1 and R2. In
this situation, message W12, W22 and W2 are irrelevant and set to ∅ to avoid interference. We also set W0, W01,
W02 to ∅ and loosen the requirement for transmitter T1 by not requiring it to help in transmitting W0, W01 and W02.
Then we get the outer bound from the result of broadcast channel with common message d1 + d11 + d21 ≤ M1,
which is outer bound (20). Similarly, by considering the embedded broadcast channel with transmitter T2, we get
outer bound (21).

Next we prove outer bound (15). Outer bounds (14), (16) and (17) can be similarly inferred. Consider the channel

depicted in Figure 2.(a), in which there is no communication link between transmitter T1 and receiver R2. Since
channel is the MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with channel matrix H21 = 0, we refer to it as the MIMO Z21
channel. The reduced message sets shown in Figure 2.(a) contains all ﬁve possible messages for this channel. Thus,

Figure 2.(a) depicts the Z21 channel with fully general message sets. Here we use * to indicate considering fully
general message sets and rename Figure 2.(a) as Z ∗

21 channel.

We show that the outer bound on the total DoF of the MIMO Z ∗

21 channel is also an outer bound of the sum-DoF

in the outer bound (15) for the original MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with general message sets, i.e.,

max

(d01 + d11 + d12 + d2 + d22).

(39)

Suppose we have a coding scheme that is able to achieve (d0, d01, d1, d11, d12, d2, d22) on the nine-message
MIMO 2 × 2 interference network. Now, suppose, in place of message W21 and W02 we use two known sequences
that are available to all transmitters and receivers a priori. Also, a genie provides W11, W1, W0 and W01 to receiver
R2. Thus receiver R2 knows all the information available to transmitter T1 and can subtract transmitter T1’s signal
from its received signal. This is equivalent to H21 = 0. Since receiver R2 already knows W1, transmitter T1
only needs to make sure that receiver R1 can successfully decode W1, so that W1 degenerates to W11. Similarly,
W0 degenerates to W01. The resulting 2 × 2 interference network becomes identical to the Z ∗ channel with the
general message set as depicted in Figure 2.(a). Since neither setting W21 and W02 to known sequences nor the
assistance of genie to receiver R2 can deteriorate the performance of the coding scheme, the same degrees of
freedom d01,Z ∗
21 = d22 are achievable on the
Z ∗ channel as well. This proves inequality (39). The argument here is similar to the proof of Lemma 1 in [7], in

21 = d1 + d11, d12,Z ∗

21 = d01 + d0, d11,Z ∗

21 = d21, d2,Z ∗

21 = d2, d22,Z ∗

which Z21 channel with only private messages is considered.

In the Z ∗

21 channel depicted in Figure 2.(a), message W2 is sent out from transmitter 2 and desired at both
receivers, R1 and R2. If we loosen this requirement and only demand receiver R2 to be able to decode this
message, the degrees of freedom of the new system will be no less than that of the original system, since reducing

decoding requirement cannot hurt. In this case, W2 actually plays the same role as W22 does. As a result, we can
combine them together and the system reduces to Figure 2.(b).

March 8, 2016

DRAFT

23

The system in Figure 2.(c) is the ordinary MIMO Z channel, which only contains private messages W11, W12,

W22. An outer bound of ordinary MIMO Z channel is given in Corollary 1 of [7], which is

max(d11 + d12 + d22) ≤ max(N1, M2).

The idea of the proof therein is to show the sum capacity of Z21 channel (Figure 2.(c)) is bounded above by
the MAC with M2 receive antennas if N1 < M2 and bounded above by the MAC with N1 receive antennas if
N1 ≥ M2. The multiplexing gain of a MAC cannot be greater than the total number of receive antennas. Therefore,
we have max(d11 + d12 + d22) ≤ max(N1, M2) for Figure 2.(c). Now, consider the Z21 channel in Figure 2.(b), in
which one additional common message W01 is applied. Following the exact same argument as in [7] , we get that
the sum capacity of Z21 channel (Figure 2.(b)) is bounded above by corresponding MAC with common message,
whose multiplexing gain is also no greater than its total number of receive antennas, i.e.,

max(d01 + d11 + d12 + d22) ≤ max(N1, M2).

Including common message or not doesn’t affect the relationship and transformation between Z channel and

corresponding MAC channel in the proof. The reader can refer to [7] for more details.

So far we obtained an outer bound for the MIMO Z ∗ channel with general message sets in Figure 2.(a), which

is

max(d01 + d11 + d12 + (d2 + d22)) ≤ max(N1, M2).

According to inequality (39), we have that an outer bound for the MIMO 2 × 2 interference network with general

message sets is

d0 + d01 + d1 + d11 + d12 + d2 + d22 ≤ max(N1, M2),

which is the outer bound (15).

Similarly, we obtain outer bounds (14), (16) and (17) from the MIMO Z ∗

11 channel respectively. The
ij (i, j ∈ {1, 2}) channel consists of message Wbij, Wibj, Wbibj, W0bi and Wbj,

VI. ACHIEVABILITY OF THE INNER BOUND

We have already described the precoding scheme and given the expressions for all the beamformers for all nine

messages in the outline of proof of Lemma 11. In this section, we continue the proof and show that, using this

scheme, the inner bound Din = co(cid:0)D ∩ Z9

+(cid:1) is achievable.

First, it is shown that all the desired messages are distinguishable, at their intended receivers; and then, we show

that the region achievable is identical to Din.

A. Independence requirements

The messages received by each receiver can be divided into two groups based on whether they are desired or

undesired messages. The undesired messages are also potentially sources of interference. For receiver R1, desired
messages contain WD1=(W11, W12, W01, W1, W2, W0), and undesired messages contain WU1=(W21, W22, W02).
For receiver R2, desired messages contain WD2=(W21, W22, W02, W1, W2, W0), and undesired messages contain
WU2=(W11, W12, W01). Let Di denote the matrix of received vectors associated with the desired messages at
receiver i, and Ui denote the matrix of directions of the receive beamformers associated with the undesired messages

at receiver i. We thus have

D1 =(cid:20)H11V11 | H12V12 | [H11 H12] V01 | · · ·
· · · H11V1 | H12V2 | [H11 H12] V0(cid:21)
D2 =(cid:20)H21V21 | H22V22 | [H21 H22] V02 | · · ·
· · · H21V1 | H22V2 | [H21 H22] V0(cid:21)

U1 =(cid:20)H11V21 | H12V22 | [H11 H12] V02(cid:21)
U2 =(cid:20)H21V11 | H22V12 | [H21 H22] V01(cid:21).

For successful communication, each receiver needs to be able to decode all its own desired messages. In order

to take the most advantage of channel resource, we allocate as much resource as possible to desired messages to

minimize the resource consumed by undesired messages, i.e., by interference.

Lemma 13. If all the channels are generic and the following constraints are satisﬁed

d1 + d2 + d0 + d01 + d11 + d12 + d21 + d22 + d02

− Z21 − Z22 − A1 − Z02 ≤ N1

These independence results together ensure that all desired messages are distinguishable, and thus decodable, at

their intended receivers.

Note that, constraints (40) and (41) imply that the total independent number of received beamformers at receiver

Ri will be no greater than Ni, the number of its antennas; constraints (42) and (43) imply that the number of

independent streams sent out by transmitter Ti are restricted to be no greater than Mi; constraint (44) implies that

the number of all independent streams two transmitters sent out together will be no greater than their total number

of antennas.

Regarding the independence result, equations (45) and (46) give the dimension of the subspace spanned by

the received beamformers associated with the undesired messages, i.e., interference; equations (47) and (48) show

that the directions of the received beamformers associated with the desired messages at each receiver are linearly

independent of each other; equations (49) and (50) indicate that the subspace occupied by the desired messages is

linearly independent of that of the interference.

Proof: We only give the proof of (45), (48) and (49), since the other three follow in the same way.

First consider equation (45). According to the expressions of beamformers provided in equations (32), (34) and

(36), we have that V Z

21 and V Z

22 are drawn from the nullspace of H11 and H22, respectively, and V Z

02 is generated

from the nullspace N ([H11 H12]). Thus, they will all be zero-forced at receiver R1, i.e.,

H11V Z

[H11 H12]V Z

One can observe that the nullspace of H11 and H12 is closely related to the nullspace of [H11 H12]. In particular,

(40)-(44), the total number of beamformers transmitted in any channel is always no greater than the channel

Since all of these beamformers in VA and VB are derived from [H11 H12] or generated randomly, they are
independent of channel matrix [H21 H22]. Since H21 and H22 are both full rank matrices with generic elements,
the column vectors of [H21 H22] [VA VB] will be linearly dependent only if they have to be linearly dependent.
Because we have the constraint (41), which indicates d21 + d22 + d02 + d1 + d2 + d0 ≤ N2, [H21 H22] [VA VB] will
have rank d21 + d22 + d02 + d1 + d2 + d0 almost surely. So, we have equation (48). Similarly, we have equation

Finally, consider equation (49). Since the beamformers associated with D1 are independent of the beamformers
associated with U1, the subspace spanned by D1 and the subspace spanned by U1 will be linearly dependent only
if they have to be linearly dependent. According to constraint (40), rank(D1) + rank(U1) ≤ N1. Consequently ,
rank([D1 U1]) will be equal to rank(D1) + rank(U1) almost surely. So we have equation (49). Similarly, we have
equation (50).

In Lemma 13, we show that if inequalities (40)-(44) are satisﬁed, all desired messages will be distinguishable at

their respectively intended receivers. In other words, DoF tuples that satisfy (40)-(44) are achievable. In the next

section, we explicitly characterize this achievable DoF region.

equations (23)-(28).

To prove the inner bound, we need to ﬁnd the connection between D and Deq. Interestingly, it is shown that

these two regions are identical. However, note that Deq is obtained from a 17-dimensional polyhedron in RE
+ × RA
+
deﬁned via 17 inequalities which include eight auxiliary variables. The problem is to project this polyhedron onto

the nine dimensional positive orthant RE

+. The standard technique to perform this projection is via the Fourier-
Motzkin Elimination wherein the auxiliary variables are eliminated one at a time but by creating a large number of

inequalities of O(m2) starting with m inequalities and then eliminating redundant inequalities [2]. Such a technique

is clearly infeasible for the size of the problem at hand here. Instead, we use the special structure of the inequalities

that deﬁne Deq to prove that it is equivalent to D in the following lemma.

Lemma 14. The 9-dimensional region D is equal to Deq.

Proof: First show any vector in D is also in Deq, and then show any vector in Deq is also in D. The detailed

proof is given in Appendix A.

Thus, we prove that the inner bound Din = co(cid:0)D ∩ Z9

+(cid:1) is achievable.

C. No interference alignment is needed for W01 and W02

In our precoding scheme, interference alignment is used only among the four private messages. Only zero-forcing

is used for the cognitive and common messages W01 and W02. In this section, we demonstrate why.

Consider W02, for instance. If M1 + M2 > N1, transmit zero-forcing of W02 is possible. We can choose
beamformers for W02 from the null space N ([H11 H12]). It is worth noting that N ([H11 H12]) has already been
used to generate V Z

where α, β, γ ∈ C1, v0 is a column vector in the null space N ([H11 H12]). To make W A
02 distinguishable at receiver
R2, v0 must be linearly independent of the already used subspace of N ([H11 H12]). Hence, if we transmit a data
symbol in W A
02 by having its direction lie in the subspace spanned by the directions associated with data symbols
22, we consume one dimension in N ([H11 H12]). A similar result holds in attempting to align with
21 and W A

in W A

existing interference H11V R

21 or H12V R

22 at receiver R1.

In summary, for each W02 stream, both transmit zero-forcing and interference alignment consume one more
available dimension of N ([H11 H12]). In other words, either strategy costs the same in terms of using the remaining
subspace (if any) of N ([H11 H12]). As a practical matter, one might choose transmit zero-forcing since it easier
to compute the corresponding beamformer.

In this section, we specify the DoF regions for small special cases of Theorem 3.

VII. SPECIAL CASES

March 8, 2016

DRAFT

A. Known Results as Special Cases

Case 1. IC (Figure 3.a)

There are only two messages in the interference channel, i.e., W11, W22. By eliminating all absent variables in

D, we get the degrees of freedom region for two-user interference channel as

31

DIC =n(d11, d22) ∈ R2

+ :

d11 ≤ min(M1, N1), d22 ≤ min(M2, N2),

Hence, Theorem 3 reduces to the well-known result in [3]. We can follow the precoding scheme shown in Section

d11 + d22 ≤ min (max(M2, N1), max(M1, N2))o
IV and skip the parts that are not applicable. In this case, we only need to consider(cid:2)V Z

11 V R

11(cid:3) and(cid:2)V Z

22 V R

22(cid:3). Only

transmit zero-forcing is possible here. Interference alignment is not applicable since there is only one source of

interference at each receiver.

Case 2. IC-CM (Figure 3.b)

Specializing Theorem 3 to the case where only messages W11, W22 and W0 are present as depicted in Fig. 3.b

(and eliminating absent variables), we have

DIC−CM =n(d11, d22, d01) ∈ R3

+ :

d11 ≤ M1, d22 ≤ M2,

d0 + d11 ≤ N1, d0 + d22 ≤ N2,

d0 + d11 + d22 ≤

min(cid:0)M1 + M2, max(M2, N1), max(M1, N2)(cid:1)o.

In this case, W11 and W22 are transmitted using the same scheme as in IC along with random beamforming for
W0 in the remaining channel dimensions that are still available.

Case 3. Cognitive IC (Figure 3.c)

Theorem 3, when specialized to the degraded message set depicted in Fig. 3.c, results in the DoF region of the

Cognitive IC, which is

Dco−IC =n(d01, d22) ∈ R2

+ :

d01 ≤ N1, d22 ≤ min(M2, N2),

This DoF region matches with the result of [17] in the same cognitive message sharing scenario. In this case, we only

d01 + d22 ≤ min(cid:0)M1 + M2, max(M2, N1)(cid:1)o.

need zero-forcing and random beamforming to achieve any vertex of the DoF region. The dimensions of symbols of

March 8, 2016

W01 and W22 that are transmitted using zero-forcing are min (d01, (M1 + M2 − N2)+) and min (d22, (M2 − N1)+),
respectively.

32

B. Examples of New Results

Case 4. Generalized Cognitive IC (Figure 4.a)

Consider the generalized cognitive IC, in which there are three messages W21, W01 and W22. In this model,
the two transmitters send one message each, i.e., W21 and W22, respectively, to Receiver 2 along with another
message, i.e., W01, cooperatively to the Receiver 1. Specializing Theorem 3 to this model, we have the following
DoF region result

Dg−co−IC =(cid:8)(d21, d22, d01) ∈ R3

+ :

d01 ≤ N1, d21 ≤ M1, d22 ≤ M2,

d21 + d22 ≤ N2,

d01 + d21 ≤ max(M1, N1),

d01 + d22 ≤ max(M2, N1),

Both zero-forcing and interference alignment, if possible, are used to mitigate the impact of two private messages

d01 + d21 + d22 ≤ M1 + M2(cid:9).

W21 and W22 on their common unintended receiver, i.e., receiver R1; while zero-forcing, if possible, is used to
reduce the interference received by receiver R2 due to message W01.

Case 5. Broadcast Channel with Partially Cognitive Relay (BC-PCR) (Figure 4.b)

Consider the model depicted in Figure 4.b. Transmitter 1 broadcasts two private messages W11 and W21 to two
receivers, respectively, while it simultaneously cooperates with transmitter 2 (the PCR) to send another message

W01 to receiver R1. From Theorem 3, we can deduce the DoF region of BC-PCR as

+ :

DBC−P CR =n(d21, d11, d01) ∈ R3
d01 + d11 + d21 ≤ min (M1 + M2, max(M1, N1))o.

d21 ≤ N2, d01 + d11 ≤ N1, d11 + d21 ≤ M1,

From the analysis in Section VI-C.B.(2), we know that using zero-forcing, if possible, is enough for transmitting

message W01. There is no need to additionally attempt to align the symbols of W11 and W01 together at receiver
R2, since interference alignment and zero-forcing costs the same in terms of using the null space of [H21 H22].

The degrees of freedom region for the nine-message MIMO 2 × 2 interference network is established. Each of

the nine messages is uniquely identiﬁed based on the transmitter(s) it is known to and the receiver(s) at which it is

desired and therefore include broadcast/multiple-access/multicast/cognitive/common messages. The DoF region for

a setting that involves any subset of the nine messages can thus be derived as a special case. In particular, the DoF

region of the MIMO X channel, a problem that remained open despite previous studies, is completely settled.

The achievability scheme uses (a) transmit zero-forcing, a well-known technique known to be sufﬁcient for the

MIMO IC [2], interference alignment and symbol extensions the necessity (but not sufﬁciency) for which was

discovered in the context of the constant-coefﬁcient MIMO X channel in [7], and ﬁnally, asymmetric complex

signaling which was discovered in the context of the constant-coefﬁcient SISO X channel in [8], but whose

beneﬁt (necessity or sufﬁciency) in the MIMO (i.e., non-SISO) X channel remained unclear despite [7], [8]. The

achievability scheme in this paper combines the principles of transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment, symbol

extensions and ACS in a novel way that allows not only the complete characterization of the DoF of the four-message

MIMO X channel – thereby proving that they are both necessary and sufﬁcient in general for the constant-coefﬁcient

MIMO X channel – but also the precise DoF region of the much more general nine-message, constant-coefﬁcient

MIMO 2 × 2 network considered in this paper.

In considering some interesting subsets of the general message set (including the 9-message case) for the 2 × 2

MIMO interference network, and making simplifying assumptions on the channel models if needed, future work

could include the discovery of new encoding and decoding principles inspired by the goal of characterizing

information theoretic metrics that are ﬁner than the degrees of freedom, such as, for instance, the generalized

degrees of freedom, as was done for the two-user MIMO interference channel in [4]. There is also the potential

for the discovery of hitherto unknown encoding schemes tailored for various models of channel uncertainty, as has

been done for the MIMO interference and the MIMO X channels in [18], [19] under delayed CSIT.

APPENDIX A

EQUIVALENCE OF D AND Deq

Proof: To make the expressions more concise, we deﬁne

dsum,1 = d1 + d2 + d0 + d01 + d11 + d12

dsum,2 = d1 + d2 + d0 + d02 + d21 + d22.

Let

−→

d = (d11, d21, d12, d22, d1, d2, d01, d02, d0). First, prove if

−→

d ∈ Deq, then

−→

d ∈D.

−→

Since

d ∈ Deq, there exists at least a tuple (Z11, Z12, Z21, Z22, A1, A2, Z01, Z02) ∈ RA

+ which satisﬁes the
conditions in (59)-(70), such that inequalities (54)-(58) are all satisﬁed. Then, from inequalities (54), (60), (63) and

(64), we get

Hence,

dsum,1 + d21 + d22 + d02 ≤ N1 + (M1 − N1)+ + d22 + d02.

dsum,1 + d21 ≤ N1 + (M1 − N1)+ = max(M1, N1),

which is inequality (14) in the deﬁnition of D. Similarly, it can be shown that

dsum,1 + d22 ≤ N1 + (M2 − N1)+ = max(M2, N1)

dsum,2 + d11 ≤ N2 + (M1 − N2)+ = max(M1, N2)

dsum,2 + d12 ≤ N2 + (M2 − N2)+ = max(M2, N2).

which are inequalities (15)-(17) in the deﬁnition of D.

Again, from inequalities (54), (62), (63) and (64), we get

dsum,1 + d21 + d22 + d02 ≤ N1 + d21 + d22 + d02 − A1,

hence,

which is inequality (18) in the deﬁnition of D. Similarly, we have

dsum,1 ≤ N1 − A1 ≤ N1,

dsum,2 ≤ N2 − A2 ≤ N2,

which is inequality (19) in the deﬁnition of D.

Furthermore, inequalities (20)-(22) hold for

−→

d since they are also contained in the deﬁnition of Deq. Consequently,

all inequalities in the deﬁnition of D are satisﬁed and we have that

−→

d also belongs to D. Thus,

Deq ⊆ D.

(71)

Next, we prove that if

−→

d ∈ D, then

−→

d ∈ Deq.

−→

For each

d ∈ D, we choose the value for (Z11, Z12, Z21, Z22, A1, A2, Z01, Z02) according to equations
(23)-(31). It is straightforward to verify the above choices satisfy the constraints (59)-(70). Also, by exhaustively

enumerating all possible relations among M1, M2, N1, N2, d and removing the (·)+ and min(·, ·) operators, and
substituting the values of the 8 auxiliary variables, we can verify that if inequalities (14)-(19) hold, then inequalities

(54) and (55) also hold. Inequalities (56)-(58) automatically hold since they are contained in the deﬁnition of D.

and hence

−→

d also belongs to Deq. Thus

Together with (71), we have D = Deq.

D ⊆ Deq.
