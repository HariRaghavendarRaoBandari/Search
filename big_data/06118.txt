We develop an analytical theory that accounts for the image and surface charge interactions
between a charged dielectric membrane and a DNA molecule translocating through the membrane.
Translocation events through neutral carbon-based membranes are driven by a competition between
the repulsive DNA-image-charge interactions and the attractive coupling between the DNA segments
on the trans and the cis sides of the membrane. The latter eﬀect is induced by the reduction of
the coupling by the dielectric membrane. In strong salt solutions where the repulsive image-charge
eﬀects dominate the attractive trans-cis coupling, the DNA molecule encounters a translocation
barrier of ≈ 10 kBT . In dilute electrolytes, the trans-cis coupling takes over image-charge forces
and the membrane becomes a metastable attraction point that can trap translocating polymers over
long time intervals. This mechanism can be used in translocation experiments in order to control
the DNA motion by tuning the salt concentration of the solution.

INTRODUCTION

Macromolecular interactions are the driving force be-
hind many biotechnological applications. Among them,
the electrophoretic translocation of DNA molecules
through membrane nanopores has recently attracted a
huge amount of attention. The sequencing method pro-
posed by Kasianowicz et al. [1] aims at decoding the ge-
netic content of a translocating DNA sequence via the
variations of the ion ﬂux through the nanopore. In order
to facilitate the mapping between the ionic current sig-
nal and the genetic information, extensive experimental
[2–12] and theoretical [13] eﬀorts have been taken during
the past three decades. Despite the progress achieved so
far, there are still many outstanding problems in polymer
translocation.

A central feature of sequence reading during transloca-
tion is the control over the DNA motion. It was recently
shown that a mapping between the genetic content and
the ionic current ﬂuctuations can be established exclu-
sively for the translocation events with the longest life-
time [5]. Thus, improving the accuracy of this method
necessitates the reduction of the DNA translocation ve-
locity. Achieving this goal by reducing the externally
applied electric ﬁeld is clearly not optimal since the pre-
cision of this approach also depends on the strength of
the ionic current signal. Thus, it would be desirable to
control the DNA motion independently of the external
electric ﬁeld. To this end, quantitative characterization
of the interactions between the DNA and its surrounding
medium becomes essential.

The complexity of the translocation problem stems
from the complicated entropic, hydrodynamic, and elec-
trostatic interactions between the polymer, the sol-
vent molecules, the ions, and the translocated mem-
brane. Previous theoretical and numerical investigations
of translocation processes have mainly focused on en-
tropic issues related to the ﬂexibility of the polymer and
its steric interactions with the nanopore [14–17]. Consid-
ering that the highly charged DNA molecules with line
charge density λ = 2 e/(0.34 nm) are strongly coupled
to the dielectric membrane and the mobile ions in the
solution, neglecting electrostatic interactions is clearly
a drastic approximation. Important steps in this direc-
tion have been taken by Ghosal [18, 19] and Muthuku-
mar [20, 21], who coupled the Stokes-level hydrodynam-
ics with the mean-ﬁeld (MF) level electrostatics of DNA.
These MF formalisms provided an elegant and analyti-
cally transparent electrohydrodynamic theory of polymer
translocation.

The MF electrostatics based on the Poisson-Boltzmann
(PB) equation is known to fail in the presence of multi-
valent ions or any dielectric contrast in the system. The
latter fact is particularly important in polymer translo-
cation since the artiﬁcial and biological membranes used
in translocation experiments are usually made of carbon-
based materials with a low dielectric permittivity εm ≈
In view of the high solvent dielectric permittivity
2.
εw ≈ 80, one expects strong image-charge forces acting
on the mobile ions and the portions of the translocating
polyelectrolyte located inside and outside the nanopore.
In order to overcome this problem, in Ref. [22] we in-
troduced the ﬁrst correlation-corrected electrohydrody-
namic theory of polymer translocation. Within this the-
ory that includes image-charge eﬀects and correlations
at the full one-loop level, we showed that adding mul-
tivalent counterions to the solution presents itself as an

eﬃcient way to control the DNA translocation velocity.
In particular, a suﬃcient amount of multivalent cations
can neutralise or even invert the DNA charge. This ef-
fect can in turn stop the translocating DNA or reverse
its direction. It should be noted that the reversal of the
electrophoretic DNA mobility has also been observed in
the MD simulations of Luan and Aksimentiev [23] and in
translocation experiments [24].

The main limitation of the beyond-MF formalism of
Ref. [22] is that the model accounts exclusively for the
portion of the DNA located inside the nanopore and
neglects the portions on the trans and cis sides. This
approximation is valid in describing DNA translocation
through thick membranes. However, it should be noted
that the thickness of the graphene-based membranes used
in translocation experiments can be reduced up to d ≈ 6
˚A [25]. Hence, at any given time during translocation
most of the polymer segments are either on the cis or the
trans side, experiencing image-charge forces induced by
the dielectric contrast between the solvent and the mem-
brane. Such forces are expected to have a strong inﬂuence
on the translocation process. Motivated by this fact, in
the present work we develop a polymer translocation the-
ory that accounts for the interactions between the mem-
brane and the segments of the DNA located outside the
nanopore. In Section II, we calculate the grand potential
of the translocating DNA through a charged dielectric
membrane. The theory is an extension of the model in
Ref. [26], where we considered the approach of a DNA
molecule towards planar membranes. In Section III, we
scrutinize the eﬀect of the membrane dielectric permit-
tivity, the electrolyte density, the polymer length, and
the membrane charge on the translocation process. The
approximations of the model and future extensions are
discussed in the Conclusions and Summary section.

II. ELECTROSTATIC TRANSLOCATION

MODEL

A. General formalism

We present here an electrostatic model of a charged
polymer translocating through a membrane of thickness
d and dielectric permittivity εm. The model is depicted
in Fig. 1. The left panel illustrates the approach phase of
the DNA that was scrutinized in Ref. [26]. In the present
work, we extend the model by including the most crucial
phase of the DNA transport, namely the actual translo-
cation process depicted by the right panel of Fig. 1.
The membrane and the polymer are both immersed in a
symmetric electrolyte with two monovalent ionic species
q = ±1, bulk concentration ρb, and dielectric permittiv-
ity εw = 80. The electrolyte located at z < 0 and z > d
is assumed to be thermalized at ambient temperature
T = 300 K. We also note that dielectric permittivities
are expressed in units of the air permittivity, i.e. we set
ε0 = 1.

The polymer of length L is modeled as a rigid line
charge perpendicular to the membrane at all times. The
polymer charge density function is

σp(r) = −λ δ(cid:0)r(cid:107)(cid:1) g(z),

(1)

where λ = 2 e/(0.34 nm) stands for the bare line charge
density of the ds-DNA. Furthermore, r(cid:107) is the vector in-
dicating the position of any point in the x− y plane that
coincides with the lateral membrane surface, and g(z) is
the polymer structure factor along the z axis. In the most
general situation, we assume that the walls of the mem-
brane are uniformly charged, with the membrane charge
density function

σm(r) = σm [δ(z) + δ(z − d)] .

[26] it was shown that in the case of a ds-
DNA approaching a charged dielectric membrane, the
electrostatic polymer grand potential associated with the
presence of the membrane is composed of two contribu-
tions. These are the polymer-self energy ∆Ωpol induced
by polymer-image charge interactions and the polymer-
membrane charge interaction Ωpm,

∆Ωtot = ∆Ωpol + Ωpm.

(3)

We note that in Eq. (3), the additivity of these two con-
tributions results from the Debye-Huckel (DH) level eval-
uation of the polymer grand potential. Moreover, since
Eq. (3) is independent of the geometry, this equality is
also valid for the translocation phase. In Appendix A,
we show that in the general case, the polymer self-energy

In Eq. (7), the dielectric permittivity function ε(z) is
given by Eq. (A3) of Appendix A. We also introduced
the Bjerrum length (cid:96)B = e2/(4πεwkBT ) ≈ 7 ˚A and the
DH screening parameter κ2 = 8πq2(cid:96)Bρb. Moreover, the
product of the Heaviside step functions on the r.h.s. of
Eq. (7) takes into account the absence of charges in the
membrane. The solution to Eq. (7) satisfying the conti-
nuity of the potential ψm(z) and the displacement ﬁeld

acterizing the thickness of the counterion layer bound to
the membrane wall.

We note that the polymer grand potential of Eq. (4)
and the polymer-membrane charge interaction of Eq. (6)
exhibit a quadratic dependence on the bare DNA charge
λ and a linear dependence on the membrane charge σm,
respectively. This stems from the present DH approxi-
mation made for the sake of analytical simplicity. As we
will consider only weakly charged membranes, the DH
approximation is legitimate in the calculation of the po-
tential induced by the membrane charge. However, in
the presence of strongly charged polyelectrolytes such as
ds-DNA molecules in the solution, the DH formalism is
known to overestimate the strength of electrostatic inter-
actions. Thus, in order to overcome the DH approxima-
tion, we will opt for a variational charge renormalisation
approach developed in Ref. [27]. From now on, we will
replace the bare polymer charge density λ by an eﬀective
charge density

˜λ = ηλ,

(9)

where η stands for the polymer charge renormalisation
factor in a bulk electrolyte.

We will brieﬂy describe the application of the renor-
malisation procedure of Ref. [27] to our system. The
approach consists in inserting the rescaled electrostatic
potential ηψp(r) into the MF-level electrostatic grand
potential, with the bare potential ψp(r) which is the so-
lution of the linear PB equation for a charged cylinder
immersed in a bulk electrolyte [27],

In Eq. (10), K0(x) and K1(x) are the modiﬁed Bessel
functions [28], a = 1 nm stands for the ds-DNA radius,
and r is the distance from the axis of symmetry of the
molecule. Optimizing the resulting variational grand po-
tential with respect to the variational charge renormali-
sation factor η, we obtain the integral equation

In Fig. 2, we illustrate the numerical solution of Eq. (11)
versus the bulk salt density. Decreasing the ion density
from ρb = 1.0 M to 10−5 M, the renormalisation factor
drops from η ≈ 0.9 to η ≈ 0.3. This behaviour reﬂects
the reduction of the bare DNA charge by the cations
bound to the polymer. Moreover, as shown in Ref. [27],
approaching the pure solvent limit ρb → 0 this curve

Equations (13)-(16) characterizing the approach phase
have been derived in Ref. [26] within the pure DH limit
η = 1 (i.e. ˜λ = λ). The equations that will be introduced
in the rest of the manuscript are the original results.
Next, we calculate the electrostatic grand potential of
the polyelectrolyte translocating through the membrane.
This conﬁguration is depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1.
Since the presence of a ﬁnite length pore breaks the pla-
nar geometry of the system and complicates the theory,
we simplify the model by neglecting the part of the poly-
mer located inside the pore [29] (L, lt (cid:29) d). Within this
simpliﬁed model, the polymer of total length L is com-
posed of a section of length lt on the trans side and the
other section with length L − lt on the cis side. For this
conﬁguration, the charge structure factor is given by
g(z) = θ(−z)θ(z − L + lt) + θ(z − d)θ(d + lt − z). (17)
Inserting the function (17) into Eq. (4), the polymer self-
energy splits into two parts,

∆Ωpol(lt) = ∆Ωintra(lt) + ∆Ωinter(lt),

(18)

In terms of the renormalised charge from Eq.

culate the explicit form of the polymer grand potential
in the approach and translocation phases.

translocation phases

In the case of a polymer of length L approaching the
membrane from left, with the right end located at the
distance zt ≤ 0 from the membrane surface (see the left
panel of Fig. 1), the structure factor reads

g(z) = θ(−z)θ(zt − z)θ(z − zt + L).

Inserting this into Eq. (4) with the Green’s function (A5)

grand potentials in Equations (14)-(15) and (21)-(23).

III. RESULTS

We investigate next the electrostatic cost for the ap-
proach and the translocation of a polymer through dielec-
tric membranes. In Sections III A-III C where we scruti-
nize the eﬀect of the membrane permittivity, the salt den-
sity, and the polymer length on the translocation energet-
ics, we consider neutral membranes (i.e. σm = 0). Then,
in Section III D, we focus on the eﬀect of the membrane
charge on the translocation energy of ds-DNA molecules.

A. Membrane dielectric permittitivity

First, we consider the role played by the membrane di-
electric permittivity εm in polymer translocation through
neutral membranes (σm = 0). We plot in Fig. 3 the elec-
trostatic grand potential of Eqs. (14) and (21)-(22) for a
polymer of length L = 10 nm, a the membrane thickness
of d = 2 nm, and salt density ρb = 0.01 M. The approach
phase is depicted in terms of the polymer position zt < 0
with the (inﬁnitesimally thin) membrane surface located
at zt = 0. The translocation phase is in turn described in
terms of the translocated length lt with 0 ≤ lt ≤ L. Al-
though the most frequent carbon-based membranes are of
low permittivity εm ≈ 2, membrane engineering methods
based on the inclusion of carbon structures or graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs) into host matrices allow to increase
the membrane permittivity up to 8000 [30, 31]. In order
to cover this permittivity range, we consider extended
permittivity values.

Figure 3 shows that approaching the membrane of low
permittivity εm = 2 from the bulk region, the polymer
experiences a repulsive energy that rises monotonically
and reaches the value ∆Ωpol(0) ≈ 8 kBT at the mem-
brane surface. During the translocation phase, the grand
potential continues to rise and reaches its maximum value
∆Ωpol(lt = L/2) ≈ 12 kBT as the half of the poly-
mer translocates. In the subsequent motion of the DNA
molecule, the grand potential drops and converges to the
contact value ∆Ωpol(lt = L) = ∆Ωpol(zt = 0) as translo-
cation is completed. Moreover, for a lower membrane
permittivity of εm = 40 where the dielectric discontinu-
ity weakens, the electrostatic energy barrier is lowered
by a factor two. This shows that the barrier results
mainly from the interaction of the DNA charges with

cating a neutral membrane (σm = 0) from Eqs. (14) and
(21)-(22) at various membrane permittivities. Salt density
is ρb = 0.01 M, membrane thickness d = 2 nm, and poly-
mer length L = 10 nm. The square symbols display the low
permittivity limit εm → 0 of Eqs. (24) and (27)-(28).

their electrostatic images. This corresponds to the self-
energy term of Eq.
(21) of the grand potential. The
contribution of the interaction potential from Eq. (22)
will be investigated below.
In the case of engineered
membranes whose dielectric permittivity is larger than
that of water (e.g. the curve for εm = 500), the elec-
trostatic grand potential of the DNA becomes negative
and reaches its minimum in the half-translocated state.
Thus, with the membrane permittivity exceeding the wa-
ter permittivity, the membrane becomes an attraction
point. In particular, at the highest dielectric permittiv-
ity value εm = 8000 measured for membranes includ-
ing GNRs [30], the potential well reaches a signiﬁcantly
low value of ∆Ωpol(lt = L/2) ≈ −17 kBT . Hence, high
permittivity membranes are expected to eﬃciently trap
translocating DNA molecules.

At this point we should note that the charge renor-
malisation process introduced here allows an important
correction as it lowers the approach energies evaluated in
Ref. [26] in the DH approximation by an order of magni-
tude. This can be seen by comparing Fig. 3 of the present
manuscript with the inset of Fig. 3 in Ref. [26]. Second,
we emphasize that previous models that aimed at evalu-
ating the electrostatic cost of DNA translocation events
have focused exclusively on the energy of the translocat-
ing polymer inside the nanopore [3, 22]. The high values
of the grand potential curves in Fig. 3 indicate that the
contribution from the DNA segments located outside the
membrane is indeed non-negligible and should play a de-
terminant role in translocation events. This is the ﬁrst
important conclusion of our work. We consider next the
alteration of the polymer grand potential landscapes by
tuning the ion density of the liquid.

Since salt concentration is an easily tunable parameter,
we consider now the eﬀect of salt on the electrostatic
grand potential of the translocating DNA. We will focus
on the most relevant case of C-based low permittivity
membranes.
In order to simplify the analysis, we will
take the limit εm = 0 where the polymer grand potential
allows an analytical form.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Polymer grand potential for εm = 0.0
from Eqs. (24) and (27)-(28) at various salt concentrations.
The square symbols show the pure solvent limit ρb → 0 of
Eqs. (31)-(32). The remaining parameters are the same as in
Fig. 3.

However, at lower ion densities, the surface potential
barrier and the translocation potential exhibit opposite
behaviour. Namely, with further reduction of the salt
concentration, the grand potential of the approaching
polymer rises monotonically for zt ≤ 0. During the sub-
sequent translocation phase, between ρb = 0.01 M and
0.001 M, the translocation grand potential changes its

The prediction of Eqs. (31)-(32) is illustrated in Fig. 4 by
square symbols. The depth of the grand potential well in-
dicates that in translocation experiments with weak elec-
trolytes, the DNA molecule is expected to be trapped by
the membrane over long time periods. This is the key
result of our work. As discussed in the Introduction, in
translocation experiments accurate DNA sequencing ne-
cessitates the reduction of the translocation velocity of
DNA [5]. Thus, the observed eﬀect can be eﬃciently
used to control the DNA velocity via alteration of the
salt density in the solution.

and (27)-(28) for εm = 0 (open squares) accurately ap-

characteristic value εm = 2. Figure 4 displays the salt
dependence of the polymer grand potential. As the salt
density is reduced from ρb = 0.1 M to 0.01 M, the weak-
ened charge screening ampliﬁes the electrostatic grand
potential of the DNA during its approach (zt ≤ 0 ) and
its translocation through the membrane (0 < lt < L).

interaction with respect to the repulsive image-charge
contribution. We will now scrutinize the competition be-
tween these two eﬀects in terms of the electrostatic force
exerted by the dielectric membrane on the translocating
polyelectrolyte. According to Eq. (18), the net electro-
static force on the DNA Fpol(lt) = −d∆Ωpol(lt)/dlt can
be decomposed as Fpol(lt) = Fintra(lt) + Finter(lt). The
force components corresponding to the the grand poten-
tials (27) and (28) are given by

(34)

In Fig. 5, the characteristic salt density where the total
polymer grand potential switches from convex to con-
cave corresponds to the point where the total electro-
static force at lt = 0 turns from negative to positive, i.e.
Fpol(0) = Fintra(0) + Finter(0) > 0. Taking the limit of
long polymers κL (cid:29) 1 for the sake of simplicity, from
Eqs. (33)-(34), we ﬁnd that this condition is satisﬁed if
−Ei(−κd) < ln(2), or

(35)

Interestingly, the inequality in Eq. (35) indicates that
the thicker the dielectric membrane, the lower the criti-
cal salt concentration where the half-translocation state
switches from unstable to metastable. This stems from
the fact that the thickness of the membrane ampliﬁes
the repulsive image-charge eﬀect. For the parameters in
Fig. 5, this characteristic salt density is ρb ≈ 0.004 M. In
the pure solvent limit κ → 0, the image-charge induced
force of Eq. (33) vanishes, Fintra = 0, and the trans-cis
coupling force of Eq. (34) reads

where we took into account the Manning limit (12). We
note that as the DNA penetrates the pore, i.e. for 0 ≤
lt ≤ L/2, the force from Eq. (36) having a positive value
is directed to the mid-pore. Hence, in pure solvents, the
electrostatics of the translocation phase is solely governed
by the attractive trans-cis interaction force.

C. Polymer length

We now scrutinize the inﬂuence of the DNA length on
the translocation phase. To this end, we focus on the
evolution of the grand potential in the transition regime
of Fig. 5 where the grand potential switches from convex

at ﬁrst seem counterintuitive. In order to probe the phys-
ical mechanism behind this peculiarity, in Fig. 5, we plot
the grand potential components (27) and (28) rescaled
by the characteristic energy ∆Ω∗ = kBT (cid:96)B
˜λ2/(2κ) at
two diﬀerent salt densities. First, the proﬁle of the DNA
self-energy ∆Ωintra(lt) induced by image-charges (dotted
curves) is seen to be convex up at all salt densities, thus
driving the polymer away from the trans side. Then, the
purely negative trans-cis interaction energy ∆Ωinter(lt) of
Eq. (28) (dashed curves) exhibits a convex down shape.
Hence, this contribution attracts the right half of the
polymer towards the trans side. The negative sign of the
interaction term ∆Ωinter(lt) results from the fact that the
dielectric mismatch prevents the electric ﬁeld lines from
penetrating into the membrane. This in turn reduces
the strength of the electrostatic coupling between the cis
and the trans portions. At the salt density ρb = 10−2 M
(black curves), the repulsive self-energy dominates the
membrane-induced attractive trans-cis interaction which
results in a total grand potential ∆Ωpol(lt) of convex up
shape. Reducing the salt density to ρb = 10−3 M (red
curves), the rescaled self-energy ∆Ωintra(lt)/∆Ω∗ is sig-
niﬁcantly lowered while the rescaled trans-cis interaction
energy ∆Ωinter(lt)/∆Ω∗ barely changes. As a result, in
this dilute salt regime the trans-cis interaction takes over
the DNA self-interaction and the total polymer grand po-
tential ∆Ωpol(lt) acquires a convex down shape, favour-
ing the translation of the DNA towards the trans side.

We can conclude that the lower the salt concentration,

D. Membrane charge

We consider here translocating polymers through
charged membranes with permittivity εm = 0. Figure

various membrane charges. The grand potential of the

We set the salt density to ρb = 0.01 M where the neutral
membrane is purely repulsive (black curve). Increasing
the membrane charge to σm = 0.01 e/nm2 (red curve),
the translocation barrier of the neutral membrane sur-
vives but an attractive minimum close to the membrane
surface takes place at zt ≈ −2 nm. Thus, in weakly
charged membranes, the DNA should be trapped in the
vicinity of the membrane wall. At a stronger membrane
charge of σm = 0.03 e/nm2 (blue curve), the attractive
minimum becomes deeper while the translocation bar-
rier becomes a metastable well. Finally, at the largest
charge density σm = 0.05 e/nm2 considered in Fig. 7,
this situation is reversed as the minimum outside the
membrane turns to metastable and the half-translocated
state lt = L/2 becomes a stable energy minimum.
We have thus found that the variation of the mem-
brane charge distribution over the narrow regime 0 ≤
σm ≤ 0.05 e/nm2 drastically changes the grand potential
landscape and turns the membrane from strongly repul-
sive to attractive. This suggests that the chemical mod-
iﬁcation of the membrane surface properties is another
factor that allows for a sensitive control on the DNA
motion. Motivated by this fact, we calculate next the
lowest value of the membrane charge where the translo-
cation barrier at (cid:96)t = L/2 switches to a minimum. We
proceed as in Section III B and evaluate the electrostatic
force Ftot(lt) = −d∆Ωtot(lt)/dlt on DNA from Eq. (38).
Setting the force at the surface to zero, Ftot(lt = 0) = 0,
and considering the case of long polymers κL (cid:29) 1 by
taking the limit L → ∞, we get the characteristic charge
where the slope of the grand potential curve switches
from positive to negative as

down to up. Figure 6 illustrates the rescaled grand po-
tential proﬁle of the translocating DNA at various salt
densities and polymer lengths. We now set the polymer
length to L = 10 nm (solid curves). As we gradually in-
crease the bulk electrolyte concentration from ρb = 0.002
M (blue curve) to 0.004 M (black curve) with the half-
translocated state turning from metastable to unstable,
at the ion concentration ρb = 0.003 M (red curve), the
system passes through an intermediate state, where the
grand potential exhibits two minima at ﬁnite trans and
cis lengths. The presence of these two metastable min-
ima may result in oscillations of a translocating polymer
between the cis and the trans sides of the membrane.

Next we set the salt density to ρb = 0.002 M and
change the polymer length L (blue curve and symbols).
The comparison of the symbols and curves indicates that
the increase of the polymer length is qualitatively equiv-
alent to an increase in the ion density. Namely, the
metastable half-translocated state at length L = 10 nm
(solid blue curve) becomes unstable for the longer poly-
mer length L = 15 nm (diamonds), with the appearance
of two minima at ﬁnite translocation lengths. With a
further increase of the polymer length to L = 30 nm (tri-
angles), the translocation barrier at lt = L/2 increases
and the metastable minima split farther. In other words,
the membrane is more repulsive to longer polymers. This
stems from the fact that an increase in the polymer length
ampliﬁes the relative weight of the repulsive self-energy
∆Ωintra(lt) with respect to the attractive trans-cis cou-
pling energy ∆Ωinter(lt). In the following section we eval-

In Section III B we found that
in weak electrolytes, the attractive trans-cis interaction
takes over the repulsive image-charge eﬀect. Thus, as
the neutral membrane is already attractive to the DNA,
one needs a negative membrane charge for the polymer-
membrane charge repulsion to compensate the attractive
trans-cis coupling energy, explaining the negative sign of
the characteristic charge in Fig. 8.

which is negative since the logarithmic term is strongly

account the Manning limit of the polymer charge (12).

mittivity εm = 0.0 for various membrane charges. The salt
density is ρb = 0.01 M. The remaining parameters are the
same as in Fig. 3.

In Eq. (39), the ﬁrst positive term in the bracket cor-
responds to repulsive image charge interactions and in-
creases the critical charge. The latter is in turn attenu-
ated by the negative second term of Eq. (39) associated
with the attractive trans-cis coupling energy. In Fig. 8,
we plot the characteristic charge of Eq. (39) against the
bulk ion density at various membrane thicknesses. The
surface above and below each curve corresponds to the
parameter range where the membrane is a metastable
and an unstable point, respectively. We see that at low
salt concentrations, the characteristic membrane charge
is negative and drops with increasing salt density until
it reaches a minimum. Beyond this turning point, the
charge rises monotonically with the salt density and be-
comes positive.

The non-monotonic behaviour of the characteristic
charge curves is due to the competition between image-
charge and trans-cis interaction terms in Eq. (39). We
focus ﬁrst on the large ion density regime κd (cid:38) 1. Equa-
tion (39) shows that at large ion concentrations, the con-
tribution from the attractive trans-cis coupling is expo-
nentially screened. Consequently, only the repulsive im-
age charge contribution survives in this regime. In ad-
dition, the salt screening attenuates the ﬁeld induced by
the membrane charge. Thus, the larger the salt den-
sity, the larger the positive membrane charge should be

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

In this work, we have developed the ﬁrst electrostatic
model of stiﬀ polyelectrolyte translocation through di-
electric membranes in electrolyte solutions. The the-
ory can fully account for the DNA-image-charge and
DNA-membrane charge interactions beyond MF level.
Unlike previous electrostatic formalisms that consid-
ered exclusively the portion of the DNA located in-
side the pore [3, 22], the model can take into account
electrostatic interactions associated with the DNA seg-
ments in the trans and the cis sides of the membrane.
This becomes crucial for translocation experiments with
graphene-based membranes whose thickness can be low-
ered up to d ≈ 6 ˚A [25]. By introducing a charge renor-
malisation procedure applied to the polyelectrolyte, we
have also been able to overcome the DH approximation of
Ref. [26]. In translocation events through neutral mem-
branes, we have shown that the dielectric mismatch be-
tween the membrane and the solvent plays a leading role.
Due to the resulting image-charge eﬀects, at large ion
densities ρb (cid:38) 0.01 M, polymers translocating C-based
membranes with low permittivity εm ≈ 2 experience a
large repulsive barrier of ≈ 10 kBT . In engineered mem-
branes with large permittivity εm > εw, the membrane
becomes in turn strongly attractive as the translocation
grand potential exhibits a minimum of the order of about
10 kBT .

In the most relevant case of low-permittivity neutral
membranes, translocation is driven by competition be-
tween repulsive DNA-image charge interactions exclud-
ing the polymer from the membrane, and the coupling
between the trans-cis portions of the DNA molecule at-
tracting the latter towards the trans side. The attractive
force is due to the dielectric membrane that prevents the
electric ﬁeld lines originating from the trans and the cis
portions to pass to the other side of the membrane vol-
ume. This mechanism weakens the electrostatic coupling
between these portions, reducing the DNA grand poten-
tial with respect to the bulk liquid. In dilute salt solu-
tions with density ρb (cid:46) 0.01 M or for short polymer se-
quences, the attractive trans-cis coupling dominates the
repulsive image-charge-induced barrier. As a result, the
membrane becomes a metastable attraction point that is
expected to trap the translocating DNA over consider-
able time intervals. This peculiarity is the key result of
our work. Since an accurate sequencing of DNA requires
control and reduction of the DNA translocation veloc-
ity [5], our result suggests that this can be achieved most
simply by tuning the salt concentration of the solution.
In weakly charged membranes, the competition be-
tween the image-charge repulsion and the membrane-

10

charge attraction results in an attractive well close to
the membrane surface at zt ≈ −1 nm. At the surface
charge σs ≈ 0.01 e/nm2, this attractive minimum is fol-
lowed by a repulsive translocation barrier at lt = L/2.
Thus, polymers approaching weakly charged membrane
interfaces should be trapped outside the membrane. At
stronger membrane charges, the attractive well becomes
metastable while the translocation barrier switches to a
stable minimum of the potential landscape, driving the
polymer to the trans side. This mechanism presents itself
as an alternative way to control DNA-membrane inter-
actions via the chemical modiﬁcation of the membrane
surface properties or by tuning the pH of the solution.

For the sake of analytical simplicity and physical
transparency, there are several approximations in the
polyelectrolyte-membrane system considered here. First,
our rigid polyelectrolyte model does not account for con-
ﬁgurational ﬂuctuations of the DNA molecules. This
limitation can in principle be overcome by coupling the
Coulomb liquid model with Edward’s path integral for-
mulation of ﬂuctuating polymers [32]. However, in the
most relevant case of C-based membrane, the large per-
sistence length of ds-DNA molecules lp ≈ 50 nm is ex-
pected to be enhanced by image-charge forces. Thus,
the inclusion of polymer ﬂuctuations is not expected
to qualitatively change the conclusions of the present
work. Furthermore, as the theory includes the membrane
charge at the DH level, we have restricted ourselves to
weakly charged membranes in contact with monovalent
electrolytes. Future work including charge correlations at
the full one-loop level will allow us to consider the case
of strongly charged membranes and multivalent ions. Fi-
nally, the present theory is based on the assumption of lo-
cal equilibrium for the calculation of the grand potential.
In the future we plan to include an explicit description
of dynamics in polymer translocation.

length pore in a planar membrane was ingeniously calcu-
lated in Ref. [33] under the approximation of an inﬁnite
screening in the bulk. In a future work, this complica-
tion can be incorporated into the present theory in order
to take into account the section of the polymer located
inside the nanopore.
