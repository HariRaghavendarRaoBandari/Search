Abstract

Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) has a layered brucite-like structure in its bulk form and was

recently isolated as a new member of 2D monolayer materials. We investigated the electronic and

optical properties of monolayer crystals of Mg(OH)2 and WS2 and their possible heterobilayer

structure by means of ﬁrst principles calculations. It was found that both monolayers of Mg(OH)2

and WS2 are direct-gap semiconductors and these two monolayers form a typical van der Waals

heterostructure with a weak interlayer interaction and a type-II band alignment with a staggered

gap that spatially seperates electrons and holes. We also showed that an out-of-plane electric ﬁeld

induces a transition from a staggered to a straddling type heterojunction. Moreover, by solving

the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of single shot G0W0 calculations, we show that the oscillator

strength of the intralayer excitons of the heterostructure is an order of magnitude larger than

the oscillator strength of the interlayer excitons. Because of the staggered interfacial gap and the

ﬁeld-tunable energy band structure, the Mg(OH)2-WS2 heterobilayer can become an important

candidate for various optoelectronic device applications in nanoscale.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, graphene, a two dimensional form of carbon atoms arranged in a

honeycomb structure, led to an enormous interest in the ﬁeld of two dimensional materials

due to its exceptional physical properties.1,2 However, the lack of a band gap is a major

obstacle for the use of graphene in optoelectronic applications. Subsequently other novel

two dimensional (2D) materials such as hexagonal structures of III-V binary compounds3,4

and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)5,6 have gained a lot of interest due to their wide

range of band gap energies. The synthesized members of TMDs, notably MoS2,7 MoSe2,8
11 which have band gaps around 1-2 eV, are suitable
WS2,9 and recently ReS2

10 and ReSe2

monolayer materials for many optoelectronic applications. Beyond being novel atomic-thick

materials, lateral and vertical heterostructures of these monolayer crystals have also recieved

considerable attention.

As constituents of possible heterostructures TMDs are very promissing. Those new mem-

bers of 2D monolayer materials have tunable electronic properties from metalic to wide-gap

semiconducting12,13 and excellent mechanical properties.14 Moreover, TMDs can be used in

various ﬁelds such as nanoelectronics,7,15,16 photonics,17–19 and for transistors,6 catalysis,20

hydrogen storage,21 and Li-ion battery applications.22 Among TMDs, WS2 has been studied

intensively. It is an indirect-gap semiconductor in its bulk form while it shows a transition

to direct-gap character in its monolayer form.23–25 It was shown by Ramasubramaniam that

the optoelectronic properties of WS2 and MoX2 (X=S or Se) monolayers are tunable through

quantum conﬁnement of carriers within the monolayers.26 Shi et al. showed that the electron

eﬀective mass decreases as the applied strain increases, and monolayer WS2 possesses the
lightest charge carriers among the TMDs.27 In addition, strong excitonic features of WS2,
including neutral and redshifted charged excitons were observed by Mak et al.28 Due to these

interesting electronic and optical properties, one may go a step further and construct 2D

heterostructures incorporating monolayer WS2 with other 2D monolayer with the potential

to achieve enhanced functionalities.

Recently synthesized monolayer of Mg(OH)2, a member of alkaline-earth hydroxides

(AEH), with formula X(OH)2 where X = Mg or Ca, are candidate materials for construct-

ing such heterostructures. Magnesium and calcium hydroxides are multifunctional materials

which have many important applications in industry, technology, solid-state electronics, and

2

in photovoltaic devices.29–32 Recently, we studied Ca(OH)2 monolayer crystals and found

that the number of layers of Ca(OH)2 does not aﬀect the electronic, structural, and mag-

netic properties qualitatively while the intrinsic mechanical stiﬀness of each layer becomes

slightly larger as the structure changes from monolayer to bilayer. Very recently, Torun et

al.33 investigated the electronic and optical properties of the heterobilayer structure GaS-

Ca(OH)2 and found that it is a type-II heterojunction where spatially seperated charge

carriers can be formed. The optical spectra of diﬀerent stacking types exhibit distinct prop-

erties. Like Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2 has a layered structure in its bulk form possessing the
trigonal symmetry of the space group P3m1 (brucite).34–36 Mg(OH)2 itself is a wide-gap in-
sulator with a band gap of 7.6 eV found experimentally for the bulk structure.37 Kuji et al.

reported properties of C-doped Mg(OH)2 ﬁlms and found that the material becomes trans-

parent in the visible region and electrically conducting which are favourable properties for

applications in photovoltaic devices.38 Huang et al.39 found experimentally a spectral peak

near the band edge corresponding to strongly localized excitons with an exciton binding

energy of 0.53 eV. This indicates a strong localization of the hole and electron to the oxygen

px and py states. Most recently, successful synthesis of Mg(OH)2 monolayers on MoS2 and

their optical properties were reported by Suslu et al.40

Here, we predict an electric ﬁeld dependence of the electronic and optical properties

of the Mg(OH)2-WS2 heterobilayer structure. Our results reveal that monolayer crystal

of Mg(OH)2 combined with TMDs may lead to the emergence of novel multifunctional

nanoscale optoelectronic devices.

The paper is organized as follows: Details of the computational methodology is given

in Sec.

II. Structural and electronic properties of monolayers of Mg(OH)2 and WS2 are

presented in Sec. III while the structural properties of the Mg(OH)2-WS2 heterobilayer are

presented in Sec. IV. The eﬀect of an external electric ﬁeld on the electronic properties of

the heterobilayer structure is given in Sec. V. In Sec. VI the electric ﬁeld dependence of the

optical properties of the heterobilayer are disscussed. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VII.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY

For our ﬁrst-principles calculations, we employed the plane-wave basis projector aug-

mented wave (PAW) method in the framework of density-functional theory (DFT). For

the exchange-correlation potential, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the

Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form41,42 was employed as implemented in the Vienna ab-

initio Simulation Package (VASP).43,44 The van der Waals (vdW) correction to the GGA

functional was included by using the DFT-D2 method of Grimme.45 The inherent underes-

timation of the band gap given by DFT within the inclusion of spin-orbit-coupling (SOC)

is corrected by using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened-nonlocal-exchange func-

tional of the generalized Kohn-Sham scheme.46 Analysis of the charge transfers in the struc-

tures was determined by the Bader technique.47

The dielectric function and the optical oscillator strength of the individual monolayers

and the heterostructure were calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) on top

of single shot GW (G0W0) calculation which was performed over standard DFT calculations

including spin-orbit coupling (SOC). During this process we used 6×6×1 Γ-centered k-point

sampling. The cutoﬀ for the response function was set to 200 eV. The number of bands

used in our calculations is 320. The cutoﬀ energy for the plane-waves was chosen to be 400

eV. We included 4 valence and 4 conduction bands into the calculations in the BSE step.

The energy cut-oﬀ value for the plane wave basis set was taken to be 500 eV. The total

energy was minimized until the energy variation in successive steps became less than 10−5

eV in the structural relaxation and the convergence criterion for the Hellmann-Feynman
forces was taken to be 10−4 eV/˚A. The minimum energy was obtained by varying the lattice

constant and the pressure was reduced below 1 kbar. 27×27×1 Γ-centered k-point sampling

is used for the primitive unit cell. The Gaussian broadening for the density of states calcu-

lation was taken to be 0.05. In order to investigate the eﬀect of an external electric ﬁeld, an

electric ﬁeld is applied in the direction normal to the plane of the heterobilayer. The binding

energy per unit cell was calculated by using the following formula: Ebind=EWS2+EMg(OH)2-

Ehetero, where EWS2 and EMg(OH)2 denote the total energies of WS2 and Mg(OH)2 monolayers,

respectively, while Ehetero denotes the total energy of the heterobilayer structure.

III. SINGLE LAYER Mg(OH)2 AND WS2

Monolayer Mg(OH)2 consists of hydroxyl (OH) groups bonded to Mg atoms. As seen

in Fig. 1, the layer of Mg atoms is sandwiched between the OH groups in which O and H

atoms are strongly bonded to each other. The calculated lattice parameters for monolayer
Mg(OH)2 are a=b=3.13 ˚A. The thickness of monolayer Mg(OH)2 is 4.01 ˚A. The bond length
of Mg-O and O-H bonds are calculated to be 2.09 ˚A and 0.96 ˚A, respectively. Bader charge

analysis shows that ionic bond character is present in the Mg(OH)2 monolayer.

In the

structure each H atom donates 0.6 e to neighboring O atom and each Mg donates 0.85 e per

O atom.

Generic forms of monolayer structures of TMDs display honeycomb lattice symmetry with

the 1H phase for the dichalcogenides of Mo and W atoms. The calculated lattice parameters
for the 1H phase of WS2 monolayer are a=b=3.18 ˚A which is very close to that of Mg(OH)2
monolayer. The W-S bond length in WS2 is calculated to be 2.42 ˚A. The thickness of the
layer is 3.13 ˚A which is thinner than monolayer Mg(OH)2. In the monolayer WS2 0.55 e of

charge accumulation occurs from a W atom to each of the S atoms and the corresponding

bonding character is covalent.

The calculated band structures within HSE06 correction are shown in Fig. 2. Monolayer

Mg(OH)2 is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 4.75 eV. Both

the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) reside at the

Γ point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). The states in the VBM of the Mg(OH)2 monolayer are

composed of px and py orbitals of the O atoms.

Similar to the monolayer Mg(OH)2, monolayer WS2 is also a direct band gap semicon-

ductor but with a lower band gap of 2.30 eV. As in other TMDs, both the VBM and CBM

of single layer WS2 lie at the K point in the BZ. As seen in Fig. 2(b), spin-orbit interaction

at the VBM states is much stronger since the states are composed of dx2 and dz2 orbitals of

W atoms. There is an energy splitting of 430 meV at VBM which is much larger than that

of monolayer Mg(OH)2 which is calculated to be 25 meV.

The Fermi energy (EF ) level is set to the valence band maximum.

IV. HETEROBILAYER

The calculated lattice constants of Mg(OH)2 and WS2 monolayers are very close to each

other and therefore it is possible to construct a heterostructure of these monolayers where

we may assume a primitive unit cell containing 8 atoms in total. We considered three

diﬀerent high-symmetry stacking conﬁgurations of the monolayers (see Fig. 3). We found

that two of the stacking conﬁgurations have binding energies very close to each other but

the one with the W atoms residing on top of an interface OH group is the ground state with

a binding energy of 147 meV. For the lowest energy stacking conﬁguration the interlayer
distance is calculated to be 2.09 ˚A and the individual atomic bond lengths remain the same

as in their isolated layers. The analysis for the charge transfers between the individual

layers demonstrate that there is no depletion from one layer to the other for all the stacking

geometries shown in Fig. 3. This result is expected due to the weak vdW interaction between

the individual layers.

The calculated energy-band structure for the heterobilayer displays a semiconducting

character with an indirect band gap of 2.24 eV. As seen in Fig. 4, the VBM of the het-

erobilayer that originates from the Mg(OH)2 layer lies at the Γ point while the CBM of

the structure which arises from the WS2 layer lies at the K point. Calculated energy-band

diagram of the heterostructure also indicates the weak interlayer interaction. As seen in Fig.

4, the partial DOS (PDOS) indicates that the VBM of heterobilayer exclusively consists of

px and py orbitals of the O atoms while the CBM is characterized by the orbitals of W and S

atoms. This also demonstrates the type-II nature of the heterojunction: the two band edges

originate from diﬀerent individual layers and consequently the excited electrons and holes

are conﬁned in diﬀerent layers which leads to the formation of spatially indirect excitons.

and grey for Mg(OH)2 and WS2, respectively.

V. EFFECT OF EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD

Applying an external electric ﬁeld is one of the common method to modify or tune the

physical properties of materials. In the ﬁeld of 2D materials, a perpendicular electric ﬁeld

can lead to doping and in the case of bilayers it can induce charge transfer between layers.

Castro et al. reported that the electronic band gap of a graphene bilayer structure can be

controlled externally by applying a gate bias. They showed that the band gap changes from

zero to midinfrared energies for ﬁeld values ≤ 1 V/nm.49 Chu et al. showed a continuous

bandgap tuning in bilayer MoS2 with applied gate voltage.50 Here we present our results

for the eﬀect of a perpendicular electric ﬁeld on the electronic and optical properties of the

heterobilayer.

As seen in Fig. 5(a), the heterostructure is an indirect band gap semiconductor when

9

there is no external electric ﬁeld, in which the VBM is at Γ but the CBM is at the K point.

Appyling a positive electric ﬁeld decreases the band gap (from 0.97 eV to 0.34 eV for E=
+0.6 V/˚A). The reason for such decreasing band gap is the shift of the band edges at the

Γ and the K points. Increasing the value of the positive electric ﬁeld shifts the VBM of

Mg(OH)2 up in energy while it shifts the CBM of WS2 down resulting in a decrease of the

energy gap. The indirect character of the energy gap is not aﬀected by the ﬁeld. However,

changing the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld widens the band gap and ultimately leads

to an indirect-to-direct band-gap-crossover as seen in Fig. 5(a).

When the strength of the electric ﬁeld is -0.6 V/˚A, it is clearly seen that both VBM and

CBM of the heterobilayer reside at the K high symmetry point in the BZ. Thus, a transition

from staggered gap to a straddling gap (type-I heterojunction) occured as shown in Fig.

5 (b).
In fact, the critical electric ﬁeld value for which this indirect-to-direct band-gap-
crossover occurs is calculated to be 0.51 V/˚A. At this critical value of the applied electric

ﬁeld, the valence band edge energy of the bands at the Γ and K points become degenerate.

As seen in Fig. 5(a), the bands at the valence band edge of the K point, which originate

from the WS2 layer, shift up while the bands at the Γ point which originate from the

Mg(OH)2 layer shift down when making the external electric ﬁeld more negative. Due to

these opposite shifts of the VBM of the individual layers (see Fig. 5(b)) a transition from

indirect-to-direct gap is predicted at a certain value of the applied ﬁeld. After the transition

to type-I heterojunction both type of charge carriers are conﬁned to the WS2 layer which is

desirable for applications in optoelectronic devices and for semiconductor laser applications.

It is also important to point out that including quasiparticle energies might slightly change

the band gap and the electric ﬁeld value for which the indirect-to-direct band-gap-crossover

occurs. However, the overall tunability characteristic of the heterobilayer using electric ﬁeld

would remain the same.

VI. OPTICAL PROPERTIES

In order to investigate the optical properties of the isolated monolayers and the het-

erostructure, we solved the BSE equation on top of G0W0 calculation. In Fig. 6 we show the

imaginary part of the dielectric function and the oscillator strength of the optical transitions

of WS2 (Fig. 6(a)), Mg(OH)2 (Fig. 6(b)) and WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterostructure (Fig. 6(c)).

FIG. 6: (Color online) Imaginary part of the dielectric function and the oscillator strength of

the optical transitions of (a) WS2 monolayer (b) Mg(OH)2 monolayer and (c) WS2-Mg(OH)2 het-

erostructure. The oscillator strength of the optical transitions shown by green and red correspond

to inter and intralayer optical transitions, respectively.

FIG. 7: (Color online) Imaginary part of the dielectric function and the oscillator strength of the

optical transitions for diﬀerent values of the perpendicular electric ﬁeld. The oscillator strength of

the optical transitions which are shown in green and red correspond to inter- and intralayer optical

transitions in the heterostructure, respectively.

11

The ﬁrst two peaks at 1.67 and 2.08 eV in the optical spectrum of monolayer WS2

(Fig. 6(a)) originate from the optical transitions at the K point in the BZ. The splitting

(410 meV) of these two peaks is consistent with the splitting of the VBM bands at the K

point due to the SOC eﬀect (Fig. 2). Our calculations show that the oscillator strength

of the optical transitions of the WS2 monolayer is an order of magnitude larger than that

of the Mg(OH)2 monolayer. The ﬁrst two optical transitions for the monolayer Mg(OH)2

(Fig. 6(b)) are split with a very small energy of 58 meV, this value is close to the value of

the VBM splitting at the Γ point due to the SOC eﬀect (Fig. 2).

In Fig. 6(c) we show the imaginary part of the dielectric function and the oscillator

strength of the optical transitions of the WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterostructure. As seen from the

ﬁgure the ﬁrst two peaks in the optical spectrum originate from the WS2 monolayer. The

splitting of the ﬁrst two peaks increases to 480 meV and the positions of them are blueshifted

due to the interaction between the two monolayers. Although the oscillator strength of the

peaks from the Mg(OH)2 monolayer are small, they can still be identiﬁed around 4 eV in

the optical spectrum. The exciton binding energy of WS2, Mg(OH)2 and the heterobilayer

is found to be as 0.84 eV, 2.4 eV and 0.74 eV, respectively.

As discussed earlier, the WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterostructure is a type-II heterojunction in

the absence of an electric ﬁeld. In this kind of heterojunctions spatially direct absorption

(intralayer excitons) and spatially indirect emission (intralayer excitons) are expected as

observed experimentally in the WSe2-MoS2 heterostructure.48 Therefore, diﬀerent exciton

peaks might dominate the optical spectrum depending on the measurement method. For

instance, the intralayer excitons (red optical transitions in Fig. 6(c)) will dominate the ab-

sorption spectrum, while interlayer excitons (green optical transitions in Fig. 6(c)) dominate

the emission spectrum (i.e. photoluminescence (PL) measurements) of the heterostructure.

So, in order to make a reasonable comparison between experiment and our calculations, we

identiﬁed the optical transitions that correspond to inter- and intralayer excitons and plot

them, respectively, in green and red color in Fig. 6(c). As shown in Fig. 6(c), the main

optical transitions of the heterostructure originate from the intralayer recombinations and

their oscillator strength is an order of magnitude larger than the oscillator strength of the

interlayer excitons.

As mentioned before, the WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterobilayer has a type-II alignment and it

transforms into a type-I heterostructure under an external out-of-plane electric ﬁeld of -

12

0.51 V/˚A. In order to investigate the variation in the optical properties of the heterobilayer

under diﬀerent electric ﬁeld strengths, we calculated the dielectric function and the oscillator

strength of the diﬀerent optical transitions under out-of-plane electric ﬁeld of -0.6, -0.3, 0 ,
0.3 and 0.6 V/˚A which are shown in Fig. 7. Since the WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterobilayer remains
type-II for out-of-plane electric ﬁeld of -0.3, 0 , 0.3 and 0.6 V/˚A, the red optical transitions

will dominate the absorption spectrum but the green ones dominate the PL measurements.
When the external out-of-plane electric ﬁeld is -0.6 V/˚A, the structure becomes type-I. In this

case, the intralayer optical transitions (red) will dominate the PL measurements. Therefore,

we predict an increase in the PL intensity of the WS2-Mg(OH)2 heterobilayer when the
out-of-plane electric ﬁeld becomes more negative than -0.51 V/˚A. Applying perpendicular

electric ﬁeld also modiﬁes the exciton binding energy of the heterobilayer. According to our

calculations, the exciton binding energy of the heterobilayer becomes 0.77, 0.76, 0.65 and
0.10 eV for -0.6, -0.3, 0.3 and 0.6 V/˚A electric ﬁeld, respectively.

VII. CONCLUSION

We investigated the structural, electronic and optical properties of the monolayers

Mg(OH)2 and WS2 and its heterobilayer structure.

In addition the eﬀect of an applied

out-of-plane electric ﬁeld on the electronic and optical properties of the heterobilayer were

investigated. We found that both Mg(OH)2 and WS2 are direct-gap semiconductors while

the Mg(OH)2-WS2 heterobilayer structure is an indirect-gap semiconductor. Our results

demonstrated that both the band gap and the energy-band dispersion of the heterobilayer

structure can be tuned by the application of an external perpendicular electric ﬁeld. At an
applied electric ﬁeld of -0.51 V/˚A a transition from a staggered to a straddling gap hetero-

junction occurs which can be used for optoelectronic and semiconductor laser applications.

In addition, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of single shot G0W0 calculations,

we predict that the oscillator strength of the intralayer excitons of the heterostructure is

an order of magnitude larger than the oscillator strength of the interlayer excitons. It ap-

pears that heterobilayers of TMDs and AEHs may ﬁnd applications in various nanoscale

optoelectronic devices.
