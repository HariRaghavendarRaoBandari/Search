A number of results on quantum quenches in the Luttinger and related models are surveyed

with emphasis on post-quench correlations. For the Luttinger model and initial gaussian

states, we discuss both sudden and smooth quenches of the interaction and the emergence of a

steady state described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Comparisons between analytics and

numerics, and the question of universality or lack thereof are also discussed. The relevance

of the theoretical results to current and future experiments in the ﬁelds of ultracold atomic

gases and mesoscopic systems of electrons is also brieﬂy touched upon. Wherever possible,

our approach is pedagogical and self-contained. This work is dedicated to the memory of

our colleague Alejandro Muramatsu.

INTRODUCTION

The study of non-equilibrium dynamics in isolated many-particle systems has become a very

active research area in recent years [1, 2, 4]. Many review articles have been devoted to various

aspects of it [2, 4]. This article focuses on a speciﬁc topic which is concerned with the quench

dynamics of the Luttinger and related models. Even with this constraint in mind, the number of

results that have continued to appear since one of us [21] studied the quench of the interaction in

this model in 2006 is fairly large.

Almost a decade has gone by, and with a certain perspective, we have tried to provide a historical

and personal account of how some of the ideas developed and what the concerns of the community

at the time were. Of course, we have attempted to survey some of the most interesting developments

in recent years, while providing a (hopefully) pedagogical introduction to the subject. This has

forced us to make many choices in order to render the article as self-contained and coherent as

3

possible. For this reason, we would like to stress from the beginning that this work is far from

perfect and cannot be considered comprehensive. When undertaking the task of surveying the

ﬁeld, we have tried our best to overcome our personal biases, however diﬃcult this may be. But as

humans facing space and time constraints, we may have ended up leaning towards what we know

and understand best. Not surprisingly, this also overlaps strongly with our own work in the ﬁeld.

Nonetheless, we hope that this article will serve as a good starting point (and even as an

inspiration!) for those students and non-experts willing learn about this fascinating subject. At

the same time, we apologize in advance to all the experts who, after going through the manuscript,

ﬁnd that we did not properly represent the most interesting aspects of their work, or those whose

work has been (unintentionally) omitted. Hopefully some of those mistakes can be corrected in the

future. Without further ado, let us get started. The rest of the paper is divided in six sections.

In the ﬁrst two, we deal with the dynamics of the post-quench correlations in sudden and smooth

quantum quenches. Section V discusses the generalized Gibbs ensemble describing the asymptotic

long-time state following a sudden quench, and its relation to the ideas of quantum entanglement.

In section VI, we brieﬂy survey some of the results obtained for other models that are related to

the Luttinger model. Section VII discusses the relevance of the results for experiments both with

quantum gases and in mesoscopic physics. Finally, in section VIII, we provide our conclusions and
an outlook. From this point on, we shall work in units where  = kB = 1.

II. THE LUTTINGER MODEL IN EQUILIBRIUM: A BRIEF HISTORY

Luttinger [5] introduced the model that bears his name in 1963 as an example of an exactly

solvable model of intreracting spinless fermions. However, the solution that he obtained for his

own the model was not entirely correct, as it was shown shortly thereafter by Mattis and Lieb [6].

Luttinger’s assumptions included a linear dispersion for the fermions [5]. However, since such

a dispersion can take arbitrarily large negative values, in order to obtain a physically sensible

model with a spectrum bounded from below, Luttinger had to occupy all single-particle levels

with negative kinetic energy with an inﬁnite number of fermions.

In other words, the ground

state of Luttinger’s model is a ‘Dirac sea’. This was quite a departure from the non-relativistic

models studied in the theory of quantum many-particle systems up to that point. In those models,

such as the gas of interacting fermions with a parabolic dispersion, the single-particle dispersion is

bounded from below. Thus, the ground state is a Fermi sea containing a ﬁnite number of fermions.

By contrast the number of particles in the Dirac sea is inﬁnite and Luttinger’s model is indeed

4

a quantum ﬁeld theory in disguise. Indeed, in particle physics, the Lorentz-invariant version of

Luttinger’s model is known as the Thirring model.

The above observations were made by Mattis and Lieb [6], who emphasized that the Dirac-sea

character of the ground state has deep consequences for the structure of the Hilbert space and

its operator content. In particular, Luttinger had used a transformation to map the interacting

model onto the non-interacting one [5]. The transformation appears to be canonical but in reality

is not [6].

Indeed, according to an earlier observation by Schwinger [9], the requirement of a

Dirac sea makes the commutation relation of certain operators, such as the density, non-vanishing

i.e. “anomalous”. This happens independently of whether such operators commute in their ﬁrst

quantized form that applies to systems consisting of a ﬁnite number of particles.

After discussing the structure of the (non-interacting) ground state, let us consider the form of

the Hamiltonian. In the notation that we shall be following in the rest of the article, the second

quantized Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of three terms, i.e. HLM = H0 + H2 + H4, where

H0 is the kinetic energy of the fermions with linear dispersion:

H0 =(cid:88)p

vF p(cid:104): ψ†R(p)ψR(p) : + : ψ†L(p)ψL(p) :(cid:105) .

In this expression vF is the Fermi velocity. The term H2 + H4 describes the interactions:

H2 =

H4 =

π

2π

L (cid:88)pkq
L(cid:88)pkq

g2(q) : ρR(q)ρL(q) : ,

g4(q) : [ρR(q)ρR(−q) + ρL(q)ρL(−q)] : .

(1)

(2)

(3)

In the above equations the operators ψα(p) (ψ†α(p)) annihilate (create) fermions with momentum
p and chirality (i.e direction of motion) α = R, L, and obey {ψα(p), ψ†α(cid:48)(p(cid:48))} = δαα(cid:48)δp,p(cid:48), anti-

commuting otherwise. For use further below, it is also useful to deﬁne the Fermi ﬁeld operator:

ψα(x) =

1

√L(cid:88)p

eisαpxψα(p),

(4)

where sR = −sL = 1. In order to avoid a degenerate ground state, we assume the ﬁeld operators
to obey anti-periodic boundary conditions, i.e. ψα(x + L) = −ψα(x), i.e. p = 2π
an integer. The normal ordering of the operator O is deﬁned as : O : = O − (cid:104)0|O|0(cid:105), where |0(cid:105)
is the ground state of the non-interacting system.
In Luttinger’s original model, the functions

2(cid:1), n being

L (cid:0)n + 1

g2(q) = g4(q), but in modern literature it has become standard to treat them as diﬀerent. It is

also assumed that the interactions have a characteristic range, R, beyond which the decay to zero

a(q) = −i(cid:115) 2π
a†(q) = i(cid:115) 2π

|q|L

|q|L

[θ(q)ρR(−q) − θ(−q)ρL(q)] ,

[θ(q)ρR(q) − θ(−q)ρL(−q)] ,

such that (cid:2)a(q), a†(q(cid:48))(cid:3) = δq,q(cid:48) and commute otherwise, as corresponds to canonical bosons.

addition, Mattis and Lieb rediscovered an exact result obtained by Jordan [7] in the context of his

neutrino theory of light, which states that the kinetic energy of the fermions with linear dispersion

can be written as:

H0 =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0

vF|q| a†(q)a(q).

(8)

Thus, since the interactions H2 and H4 are quadratic in the density operators, which means they
are also quadratic in a(q) and a†(q), we obtain with a quadratic Hamiltonian in the bosonic basis,

which can be diagonalized by means of a canonical (Bogoliubov) transformation:

a(q) = cosh ϕ(q)b(q) + sinh ϕ(q)b†(−q),

where(cid:2)a(q), a†(q(cid:48))(cid:3) = δq,q(cid:48). The Bogoliubov angle ϕ(q) is determined from the equation:

g2(q)

tanh (2ϕ(q)) =

vF + g4(q)

.

(9)

(10)

Therefore, the Hamiltonian of the interacting system, H, is diagonal in terms of the new bosonic
operator basis {b(q), b†(q)}:

In

in real space. In terms of the Fourier components g2(q) and g4(q), this means that these functions
rapidly vanish for q (cid:29) R−1. We shall also assume that they are free of singularities as q → 0.
(cid:80)p : ψ†α(p + q)ψα(p) : satisfy the following algebra [6, 17, 18]:

It was pointed out by Mattis and Lieb that the second-quantized density operators ρα(q) =

(cid:2)ρα(q), ρα(cid:48)(q(cid:48))(cid:3) =

qL
2π

δq+q(cid:48)δαα(cid:48).

In modern literature, this algebra is known as the Abelian [U(1)] Kac-Moody (KM) algebra. It was

Mattis and Lieb’s realization that the KM algebra is the key to the exact solubility of the model.

This is because it is possible to rewrite the KM algebra in terms of the operators:

HLM =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0

v(q)|q| b†(q)b(q).

where the boson velocity is given by:

v(q) =(cid:112)(vF + g4(q))2 − (g2(q))2.

6

Mattis and Lieb’s solution of the Luttinger model (LM) provided the ﬁrst concrete example of an

interacting Fermi system exhibiting an excitation spectrum that strongly deviates from Landau’s

normal “Fermi-liquid” paradigm. The spectrum of the model, as shown in Eq. (54), consists of

collective, plasmon-like, bosonic modes known as Tomonaga bosons. These bosonic elementary

excitations are quite unlike the fermionic quasi-particles that describe the low-lying states of Fermi

liquids.

Perhaps the most striking signature of the failure of the LM to conform to the framework of

normal Fermi liquids can be observed in the momentum distribution. Mattis and Lieb noticed that,
in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. for L → +∞) instead of the characteristic discontinuity at the
Fermi momentum pF , the momentum distribution of the LM exhibits a much weaker, power-law

singularity:

over the ground state of the interacting system). Mattis and Lieb were able to obtain this result by

a method equivalent to bosonization [16, 17]. Here, we shall recall the main identities and results of

this method, referring the interested reader to the vast available literature on the subject [17, 18, 28].

The method relies on the following identity:

This allows to express the Fermi ﬁelds in terms of the boson ﬁeld (sR = −sL = 1):

where a0 is a short distance cut-oﬀ and {ηα, ηα(cid:48)} = δαα(cid:48), which ensures the anti-commutation

between fermions of diﬀerent chirality. The operators φ0α and Nα = (cid:80)p : ψ†α(p)ψα(p) : are a

canonically conjugate pair (i.e. [Nα, φ0α(cid:48)] = iδα,α(cid:48)). Thus,

which also exhibits an algebraic decay with distance, but with a exponent that is independent of

the interaction (although the pre-factor is not).

As pointed out by Mattis and Lieb [6], the solution of the LM shares many interesting properties

with the approximate solution of the one-dimensional electron gas obtained by Tomonaga [8] in

1950. The striking resemblance was to become more and more important in the course of time.

Indeed, after Luttinger’s and Mattis and Lieb’s seminal contributions, the exotic properties of the

model turned out to be more than a just a mathematical curiosity. Beginning in the 1970s, the study

of one-dimensional interacting systems started to attract an increasingly large amount of attention

motivated by the advances in materials synthesis and spurred by Little’s proposal [10] for a new

class of organic high-temperature superconductors based on highly anisotropic materials made up

of quasi-one dimensional metallic molecules. Ground breaking work along in this direction was

done by Luther and Emery [11] by extending the Luttinger model to spinful fermions and ﬁnding

that, when backscattering processes are taken into account, the system develops spectral gap to

spin excitations but remains gapless for charge excitations. Such system, currently known as the

Luther-Emery liquid, is the canonical example of a one-dimensional superconductor. In addition,

Luther in collaboration with Peschel [12] provided the ﬁrst crucial insights into the fundamental

observation that the low-temperature behavior of the LM is universal and applies to a general class

of 1D models. Building upon the earlier work by Luther and Peschel on the anisotropic Heisenberg

XYZ spin-chain model, and in the spirit of Landau’s Ferm liquid theory, Haldane [13, 14] coined

the name “Luttinger liquids” for this new universality class, which encompasses a large class of

one-dimensional models of fermions [6], bosons [15], and spins [12, 13].

Indeed, in the language of the renormalization group [29, 30], the LM turns out to be a ﬁxed

point Hamiltonian for this universality class. The ﬁxed point Hamiltonian of a TLL can be written
in terms of the (total) density φ = (φR + φL)/2 and phase θ = (φR − φL)/2, as follows:

HT LL =

v

2π(cid:90) dx(cid:104)K−1 (∂xφ)2 + K (∂xθ)2(cid:105) ,

(20)

where the Tomonaga boson velocity is v = v(q = 0) (cf. Eq. 12), the so-called Luttinger parameter

is K = e−2ϕ(q=0) in terms of Bogoliubov rotation angle at q = 0 (cf. Eq. 10). Note that the

8

density stiﬀness is proportional to vK−1 and the phase stiﬀness is related to vK.

In Galilean-

invariant systems vK = ρ0/m, where ρ0 is the particle density [15, 18, 31]. The Hamiltonian

in Eq. (20) can be diagonalized and brought to a form similar to Eq. (54), with v(q) replaced

by v = v(q = 0). Thus, the low-energy excitation spectrum is completely exhausted by the

Tomonaga bosons. In recognition to Tomonaga’s pioneering contributions, the universality class

has been renamed as “Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids’ (TLLs). The deﬁning properties of the systems

in the TLL universality class are a linear dispersion of the Tomonaga bosons, and the power-law

correlations at zero temperature. The exponents of the power-laws are parametrized by K. Notice

that the previous observations apply to systems for which the interactions at q = 0 are not singular,
which implies that both v and K are ﬁnite as q → 0. This is not the case when the interactions
are long range such like the case of the Coulomb interation. We refer the interested reader to e.g.

Ref. [18] (and references therein) for an account of how the correlations are modiﬁed in this case.

III. DYNAMICS AFTER A SUDDEN QUENCH

A.

Introduction and historical context

In 2006, one of us (MAC) attended a workshop at the Max Planck Institute for Complex

Systems in Dresden. The workshop, co-organized by Alejandro Mumamatsu, was devoted to non-

equilibrium dynamics in interacting Systems. At the workshop, Rigol reported on the results of his

ground-breaking work with Dunjko, Yurovskii, and Olshanii, motivated by experiments performed

in Weiss’ group [20]. In their work, Rigol and coworkers showed that gas of lattice hardcore bosons

in 1D (also known as the XX model) does not thermalize to the standard Gibbs ensemble when

prepared in an initial state that is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.

In their study, they

provided convincing numerical evidence that the system instead relaxes to a ‘generalized’ Gibbs

ensemble, which is constructed by using a particular set of integrals of motion of the system (see

section V for a description).

Following Rigol’s report at the workshop, ensuing discussions with Muramatsu and Rigol pro-

vided enough motivation for one of us (MAC) to search for an analytically-solvable example of

such peculiar behavior. Out of the several possible candidates, the Luttinger model seemed the

most natural choice. However, several obstacles had to be surmounted. In Rigol et al.’s work, two

kinds of initial states had been considered: In one of them, it was assumed the hardcore boson gas

is initially trapped in a smaller box and suddenly released into a larger box. The second choice

9

was motivated by one of the experiments reported in Ref. [20], and considered that a bi-periodic

potential is applied in the initial state of the lattice boson gas and suddenly switched oﬀ at start

of the evolution [19].

Neither of the above choices of initial states considered seemed analytically tractable in the

case of the LM because they break translational invariance (however, see remarks at the end

of section V B). Instead, what seemed most natural and amenable to analytical calculation was

to assume that the interaction between the fermions, described by the terms H2 + H4 in the

Hamiltonian, is suddenly switched-on at the start of the time evolution. An attractive feature of

such a quench is that the eigenstates of the non-interacting system can be still described in terms of

fermionic eigenmodes. On the other hand, the eigenstates of HLM = H0 + H2 + H4 are described in

terms of Tomonaga bosons. Thus, the quench of the interaction allows to study how the fermionic

features of the spectrum are dynamically destroyed.

Assuming that the system is prepared in the non-interacting ground state, |0(cid:105) and it evolves
according to HLM = H0 + H2 + H4 for all times t > 0 is equivalent to a quantum quench of the

interaction. The term “quantum quench” was introduced by Cardy and Calabrese [24] in their 2006

pioneering work (see also this volume) where they studied the evolution of correlations when the

system is suddenly driven from a oﬀ-critical to a critical state. The main diﬀerence with situation

considered by Cardy and Calabrese is that the initial state in Ref. [21] lacks any characteristic

length scale, i.e. it is a critical state.

B. Dynamics of the Luttinger model following a quench of the interaction

The solution of the quench of the interaction in the LM can be obtained with minimal use of

formalism in the operator language[90]. The solution takes the form of a canonical transformation

relating the bosonic operators at times t = 0 and t > 0:

a(q, t) = eiHta(q)e−iHt = f (q, t)a(q) + g∗(q, t)a†(−q),

where the time-dependent (Bogoliubov) coeﬃcients read:

f (q, t) = cos (v(q)|q|t) − i cosh (2ϕ(q)) sin (v(q)|q|t)
g(q, t) = i sinh (2ϕ(q)) sin (v(q)|q|t) .

(21)

(22)

(23)

Note that f (q, t = 0) = 1 and g(q, t = 0) = 0, in agreement with the initial state of the system being
the non-interacting ground state, |0(cid:105), which is annihilated by a(q) for all q (cid:54)= 0. In addition, Eq. (21)

10

FIG. 1: Schematic evolution of the momentum n(p) distribution of the Luttinger model in the neighborhood

of the Fermi momentum, pF , following a quench of the interaction. The non-equilibrium exponent γ2 =
(K 2 + K−2 − 2)/4, where K is the Luttinger parameter, which parametrizes the correlations in the ground
state, is diﬀerent from the equilibrium exponent, γ2

eq = (K + K−1 − 2)/2

shows that the time evolution with the interacting Hamiltonian HLM alters, in a time-dependent
way, the entanglement of the modes at opposite momenta q and −q, which is a consequence of the
translational invariance of both the Hamiltonian and the initial state. We shall return to this point

in Section V. In order to obtain the time evolution of correlations from the initial (non-interacting)

state and study how the fermionic features of the non-interacting LM are wiped out, let us consider

the instantaneous single-particle density matrix [21]:

CψR(x, t) = (cid:104)0|eiHLM tψ†R(x)ψ(0)e−iHLM t|0(cid:105) = (cid:104)0|ψ†R(x, t)ψR(0, t)|0(cid:105),

(24)

which can be computed using the bosonization formula, Eq. (14), together with Eq. (21). The

calculation proceeds pretty much along the lines of the calculation in the equilibrium case [17, 18,
28, 31], and yields the following result in the scaling limit (i.e. for d(x|L), d(2vt|L) (cid:29) R):

CψR(x, t) = Z(x, t)C(0)

Likewise, we can obtain the density correlations:

CρR(x, t) = (cid:104)0|eiHLM tρR(x)ρR(0)e−iHLM t|0(cid:105) = (cid:104)0|ρR(x, t)ρR(0, t)|0(cid:105)

K = e2ϕ(q=0) is the Luttinger parameter. Note that since the correlation functions are periodic

functions of time and will exhibit periodic recurrences with a period tL = L/2v. This is the
consequence of the ﬁnite size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, L → +∞, and therefore
tL → +∞. Thus, the cord functions yield power-laws by the replacement d(z|L) → |z|.

For L → +∞ (or for |x|, 2vt (cid:28) L), the behavior of the above correlation functions exhibits two

clearly distinct regimes. At short times, i.e. for t (cid:28) |x|/2v,

(29)

(30)

That is, the correlations take a similar form to those of the non-interacting system. In the case
of the single-particle density matrix, it decreases by an overall factor Z(t) ∼ t−γ2
hand, in the long time regime, i.e. for t (cid:29) |x|/2v, the correlations crossover to

(32)

In this case, the correlations become qualitatively diﬀerent from the initial state correlations. In
particular, to leading order, they do not depend on time, which indicates that for t → +∞ the
system reaches a steady state. We shall investigate this behavior more in detail further below, in

section V. However, at this point, it is worth pointing out that the existence of the two distinct
correlation regimes separated by a time scale tx = |x|/2v has to do with the ﬁnite propagation
velocity of the elementary excitations of the LM. Since the LM is a relativistic model in which the

role of the speed of light is played by the boson velocity v, this can be expected. The time scale tx

is thus related to the time it takes for the excitations in the initial state localized at two points a
distance |x| apart to overlap. This phenomenon has been termed ’light-cone eﬀect’ by Cardy and
Calabrese [24] in their study of quantum quenches starting from an oﬀ-critical state and ending

in a critical state. In a more general framework, it is the consequence of the Lieb-Robison-type

bounds [23] for propagation of signals in systems with ﬁnite-range interactions.

The correlations in the steady state are diﬀerent from those of the initial state and from those

in the ground state of the LM. Despite the fact that the initial state is a complicated superposition

of eigenstates of HLM , the correlations are not thermal. If they were, they would exhibit an expo-

nential decay beyond a characteristic length scale determined by the ﬁnal (eﬀective) temperature

of the system Tf (see e.g. [17, 18, 28, 31] and references). To see this, let us consider an “inﬁnites-
imal” quench in which an very weak interaction (i.e. ϕ(q = 0) (cid:28) 1) is switched on. Thus, the

12

energy of the initial state diﬀers from the energy of the LM ground state (taken to be zero) by an

inﬁnitesimal amount,

(33)

which means that only low-lying excited states should be involved in the evolution following the

quench. Thus, we can use the low-temperature form of the free energy in the canonical Gibbs
ensemble for the LM (see e.g. Ref.[6]) F (T )/L (cid:39) π2T 2
f v/6. Hence, the corresponding ﬁnal temper-
ature, Tf ∝ ϕ(q = 0). However, this is still ﬁnite, which means that, if the system relaxes to the
canonical Gibbs ensemble, the correlations should decay exponentially at long distances [17, 28],

e.g.:

CψR(x, t → +∞) ∼ e−|x|/ξ(Tf ),

(34)

for |x| (cid:29) ξ(Tf ) where ξ(Tf ) ∝ v/Tf . By contrast, the asymptotic t → +∞ state following the
quantum quench exhibits power-law correlations, as we have shown above. In other words, the

system does not thermalize to the canonical Gibbsian ensemble. We will see in Sec. V that this is

because the LM is exactly solvable and relaxes instead to a generalized Gibbs ensemble.

Before discussing the properties of the asymptotic state, let us discuss the consequences of the

above results for the evolution of the momentum distribution. As discussed in Sec. II, the latter is

the Fourier transform of the equilibrium single-particle density matrix. By analogy, we can deﬁne

the instantaneous momentum distribution,

n(p, t) =(cid:90) dx e−ipxCψR(x, t) =

for ﬁnite t

),

(35)

for t → +∞.

The results on the left-hand side hold for p ≈ pF . Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the momentum
distribution schematically. The discontinuity at the Fermi momentum pF decreases algebraically
and closes for t → +∞ becoming a weaker, power-law singularity, with an exponent that diﬀers
from the exponent characterizing the discontinuity at pF in the ground state.

Additional post-quench correlation functions were obtained by Iucci and Cazalilla in Ref. [25].

We just quote here their results for the correlations of the so-called vertex operators starting

from the non-interacting ground state. For the ratio of the non-equilibrium to the initial state

Notice that the usual equilibrium duality relations requiring that if φ → θ then K → K−1 also
hold for the post-quench correlations. Besides the above results, Iucci and Cazalilla also studied

correlations at ﬁnite temperature, obtaining the momentum distribution in the asymptotic steady
state at t → +∞. In Ref. [25], a quantum quench in which the interactions are suddenly switched
oﬀ was also studied. We refer the interested reader to section II.-C of Ref. [25] for the detailed

form of the post-quench correlations in this case.

In the derivation of the previous results, it has been assumed that the interactions are long

ranged but not singular. This translates into g2(q) and g4(q) being regular functions of q as
q → 0, which is necessary to ensure that K and v are both ﬁnite. This is not the case for the
Coulomb interaction for which g2(q) = g4(q) = V (q)/2π. Here V (q) = 2e2K0(qd) is the Fourier

transform of the Coulomb potential, K0(x) being the modiﬁed Bessel function and d a length

scale of the order of the transverse dimensions system (recall that K0(x (cid:28) 1) = log(cid:0) 2

where γ = 0.5772156649 . . . is Euler’s constant). The post-quench correlations for the LM with

xeγ(cid:1) + ··· ,

Coulomb interactions have been obtained by Nessi and Iucci [26]. In what follows, we reproduce

here their results for the single-particle density matrix, specializing to the case of a quench from

the non-interacting system (which corresponds to setting Ki = 1 in their expressions). For the

single-particle density matrix CψR(x, t), the following expression for the factor Z(x, t) in Eq. (25)

was obtained [26]:

Z(x, t) = exp(cid:26)−(cid:90) +∞

0

dq

sinh2 [ϕ(q)] [1 − cos (2v(q)qt)] (1 − cos qx)(cid:27) ,

(40)

where v(q) =(cid:112)vF (vF + 2V (q)/π) is the Tomonaga boson velocity, v(q (cid:28) 1/d) ∼ vF log1/2(1/qd);

the Bogoliugov rotation angle of the LM in the presence of Coulomb interactions follows from

14

tanh 2ϕ(q) = V (q)/(2πvF + V (q)). Asymptotic expressions can be obtained from Eq. (40). For

instance, the asymptotic long time limit reads [26]:

CψR(x, t → +∞) = C(0)

ψR

(x)e− g

4 log2(x/d),

(41)

where g = e2/πvF , e being the fundamental fermion charge. This form again diﬀers from the

equilibrium expression [18, 26]. The intermediate time dynamics, however, is complicated by the
divergence of the Tomonaga boson velocity v(q) as q → 0, which leads to a non-linear light-cone
eﬀect [26]. Thus, for times fulﬁlling the condition:

d
vF (cid:28) t (cid:28) tx =

the single-particle density matrix takes the form:

x

2vF(cid:112)1 + 2g log(d/x)

CψR(x, t) = C(0)
ψR

(x)e− g

4 log2(2vF t/d)

,

(42)

(43)

with exponential accuracy. Hence, it follows that the discontinuity at pF in momentum distribution
decreases as Z(t) ∼ e− g

4 log2(2vF t/d) instead of the power-law ∼ t−γ2

found for the LM with non-

singular interactions. Asymptotic forms for other post-quench correlations, such as those of vertex

operators, were also obtained in Ref. [26], and we refer the interested reader to the original article

for the details.

C. Quest for universality: Quenches in models of the TLL class

In the previous subsection, we have reviewed the results obtained for a sudden quench of the

interaction in the LM. Since sudden quenches can potentially drive the system far from equilibrium,

there is no reason to expect that the results discussed above can be universal. Indeed, universality

applies to the low-temperature, long distance and time correlations of systems in equilibrium and

it is borne out on the ideas of the renormalization group [29, 30]. According to the latter, the

low-temperature properties of a system are rather insensitive to the microscopic details as it is the

structure of the low-lying excited states. Therefore, a sudden quantum quench that involves highly

excited states is not likely to yield correlations that are universal.

Nevertheless, since LM is a renormalization-group ﬁxed point for the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid

universality class, there is much interest in investigating to which extent correlations following a

sudden quench exhibit universality. Analytical progress in this regard is particularly diﬃcult.

Therefore, in order to ascertain whether the correlations are independent or not of the microscopic

details of the model, a number of numerical and semi-numerical techniques have been deployed.

15

In particular, the LM prediction for the dynamics of the discontinuity at pF in the momentum

distribution reviewed in the pervious section, has been numerically tested by Karrasch, Rentrop,

Schuricht, and Meden (KRSM) [32] using time-dependent DMRG [27]. KRSM considered a (sud-

den) quench of the interaction in the following lattice model:

H =

L(cid:88)m=1(cid:34)−

1

2(cid:16)c†m+1cm + c†mcm+1(cid:17) +(cid:88)m

(∆nmnm+1 + ∆2nmnm+2)(cid:35) ,

(44)

from the non-interacting system, i.e. starting from the ground state of the XX model (i.e. ∆ =
∆2 = 0) to the interacting model with either ∆ (cid:54)= 0 or ∆ (cid:54)= 0 and ∆2 (cid:54)= 0. In the former case, the
model is known as the XXZ model and it can be solved exactly using the Bethe-ansatz method

(see e.g. [18, 31] and references therein). However, when the term proportional to ∆2 is present,

the model is no longer integrable in Bethe-ansatz sense. Yet, the results in both cases showed good

agreement with the LM predictions. In addition, KRSM also obtained the evolution of the kinetic

energy per unit length, i.e.

eimp(t) = −

1
2L

(cid:104)Φ0|eiHt(cid:16)c†m+1cm + c†mcm+1(cid:17) e−iHt|Φ0(cid:105),
L(cid:88)m=1

(45)

where |Φ0(cid:105) is the ground state of the non-interacting model (i.e. Eq. 44 with ∆ = ∆2 = 0). The
time-derivative kinetic energy exhibits a universal power-law decay ∼ c(K, v)/t3 whose prefactor
c(K, v) = (K2 + K−2 − 2)vF /16πv2 [26, 32] is a function of the Luttinger parameter K and the
Tomonaga-boson velocity, v [91], which provides a further test for the universality of the LM

predictions.

More recently, a thorough study of the universality (and lack thereof) of the LM predictions

has been undertaken by Collura, Calabrese, and Essler (CCE) [33]. These authors carried out a

numerical study of a suddent quench in XXZ spin chain (cf. Eq. 44 with ∆2 = 0, see also Eq. (65)

below for the model in terms of spins). CCE analyzed quenches starting from the ground state

with the XX model (∆ = 0) and considered several values for the Ising coupling in the post-quench
Hamiltonian ∆ = ±0.2,±0.5. Using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm [27],
they numerically obtained the transverse and longitudinal spin-spin correlations, for which (to

leading order) the LM predictions are:

D. Pre-thermalization and quench in a 2D Fermi liquid

Pre-thermalization was discussed by Berges and coworkers in the context of high-energy ion

collisions [34]. It refers to metastable state of a system that has been driven out of equilibrium

rapidly establishes a kinetic temperature based on the average kinetic energy. Despite this fact,

the eigenmode distribution of the in the metastable state does not correspond to a Bose-Einstein

(for bosons) or a Fermi-Dirac (for fermions) distribution. These ideas have found resonance in the

study of non-equilibrium (quench) dynamics of ultracold atomic systems. Moeckel and Kehrein [37]

discussed them in relation to a two-stage thermalization scenario that should take place following

a quantum quench. In their work, Moeckel and Kehrein studied a quench of the interaction in the

Hubbard model using the ﬂow equation method [37]. Considering the inﬁnite-dimensional Hubbard

model on the Bethe lattice, they obtained the short to intermediate time evolution of the momentum

distribution. Their result shows some striking resemblance with the results described earlier for

the LM (cf. Fig. 1). However, one major diﬀerence with the LM is that the discontinuity at the

Fermi surface does not close completely. Instead, Moeckel and Keherein found that it saturates
at a constant value Zneq which obeys the relation (1 − Zneq) = 2 (1 − Zeq), where Zeq < 1 is the
discontinuity in the momentum distribution in the interacting ground state.

Pre-thermalization has also been discussed in connection to study of quantum quenches in

ultracold bosonic gases in Schmiedmayer’s group in Viena [35, 36]. However, in this section, we

focus on reviewing the results for the pre-thermalization dynamics for a two-dimensional (2D) gas

of spinless fermions interacting with long-ranged interactions, which, in a certain sense, can be

regarded as the 2D generalization of the LM. The dynamics ensuing a quench of the interaction in

this system has been studied by Nessi, Iucci, and Cazalilla (NIC) [39], and it may be of relevance

for the study of the non-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar quantum gases [71]. The Hamiltonian of

the model studied by NIC reads:

H = H0 + Hint,

H0 =(cid:88)k

Hint =

(50)

(51)

(52)

where ψ(k) (ψ†(k)) annihilate (create) fermions with momentum k, where k = (kx, ky) is a two

dimensional vector. As in the case of the LM, it was assumed by NIC that the system is prepared in

the ground state of the non-interacting Hamiltonian H0 and it evolves according to the interacting
Hamiltonian H for t ≥ 0, which is tantamount to a quench of the interaction. The Fourier transform
of interaction potential V (q) is assumed to vanish rapidly for |q| (cid:29) qc, where qc ∼ R (cid:29) p−1
F , R
being the range of the interaction and pF = √4πρ0 the Fermi momentum (ρ0 is the areal particle
density). In order to render the expressions analytically tractable, the Fourier transform of the

interaction potentila is taken of to be of form V (q) = f0 (q/qc)ne−q/qc, where f0 parametrizes the

interaction strength and n = 0, 1, . . . is a positive or zero integer (see below).

To access the short to intermediate time dynamics of the model, NIC ﬁrst carried out a per-

turbative analysis to leading (i.e. second) order in the interaction. Thus, they showed that, the

approaches its constant asymptote as t−1. The dimensionless inteaction coupling g = f0(cid:112)pF qc/2π2vF . The

horizontal lines indicate the long-time pre-thermal asymptote, Zneq = (Zeq)2, which is obtained from the

Fermi-surface bosonization treatment (cf. section III D).

discontinuity at pF of the momentum distribution, Z(t), also exhibits a plateau similar to the

one observed by Moeckel and Kehrein [37] in the case of the Hubbard model (see also Eckstein et

al. [38]). This plateau indicates the existence of a pre-thermalized state. Furthermore, NIC found
that, to the leading order in f0, the relationship 1 − Zneq = 2(1 − Zeq) also holds for the 2D Fermi
gas described by the above model.

In addition, in order to understand the emergence of the pre-thermalized state, NIC resorted to

the Fermi surface (FS) bosonization method [40]. This method has been applied in equilibrium and

it provides a non-perturbative foundation to Landau’s Fermi liquid theory. Unlike the equilibrium

case where the method is applied to a low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian [40], NIC applied it to

the bare Hamiltonian, H (cf. Eq. 50), which describes the interactions between the bare fermions.

Performing a truncation of H that amounts to neglecting inelastic scattering between the fermions

and keeps only forward and exchange interactions, NIC [39] re-wrote H in terms of the Fourier

components of the density operator [40]:

In writing Eq. (53),

it is assumed that a crown of width λ around the FS has been “sectorized” into N squat patches
of transverse size Λ, such that pF (cid:29) Λ (cid:29) λ > qc [92]. The constant Ω = ΛA/(2π)2. As in the
case of TLLs, the Fourier components of the density, ρS(q) obey a KM algebra [40] (|q|,|q(cid:48)| (cid:28) λ,
compare with Eq. 5):

20

(cid:2)ρS(q), ρT (q(cid:48)

)(cid:3) = Ω (q · ˆnS) δS,T δq+q(cid:48),0,

(54)

where ˆnS is a unit vector normal to the circular FS at the patch position of S. This equation

turns the diagonalization of Eq. (53) into a problem akin to a system of (chiral) Luttinger models

(one for each FS patch) coupled by forward-scattering interaction. Like in the case of the LM, the

KM algebra allows us to obtain a diagonal representation of Eq. 54 in terms of a set of bosonic

eigenmode operators:

H (cid:39)(cid:88)l,q

ωl(q)b†l (q)bl(q).

(55)

This expressions clearly shows that the short to intermediate-time dynamics described by H can

be approximated by a exactly solvable Hamiltonian, whose dynamics is strongly constrained by

the integrals of motion Il(q) = bl(q)bl(q) (more on this further below).

In addition, the diagonalization of H (neglecting inelastic scattering between fermions) allowed

NIC to obtain non-perturbative results for the evolution of the post-quench single-particle density

matrix. Using similar expressions to the bosonization formula, Eq. (14) [40], the following results

for the behavior of the discontinuity in the momentum distribution at the FS were obtained [39]:

Z(t (cid:28) R/vF ) = exp(cid:2)−ct2(cid:3) ,
Z(t (cid:29) R/vF ) = Zneqeg2an(vF qct)−(2n+1)

.

(56)

(57)

where c depends on the details of the interaction [39] and g = f0(cid:112)pF qc/2π2vF . The long-time

asymptote of Z(t) obeys Zneq = (Zeq)2, which is the non-perturbative version of Moeckel and

Kehrein’s relationship between the equilibrium and pre-thermalized values of the discontinuity at

pF [37]. The full crossover from the short time limit (which agrees with the perturbative results [39])

to the long time limit of Eq. (57) was obtained by evaluating the integrals numerically and it is

shown in Fig. 4.

Thus, the explicit construction of the exactly solvable truncation of H gives access to a non-

perturbative solution of the short to intermediate time dynamics (up to times t (cid:38) f 2

0 N (0) (N (0) =

kF /2πvF being the density of states at the Fermi level), at which inelastic collisions kick in and

should drive the system to a thermal state. In addition, it also clariﬁes the physical origin of the

phenomenon of pre-thermalization by relating it to constrained dynamics of the exactly solvable

model of Eq. (55), which is as we will exactly in section V relaxes not to the grand canonical

ensemble, but to the generalized Gibbs ensemble due to the combination of Gaussian nature of the

initial state and the dephasing between the bosonic FS eigenmodes of (55).

IV. SMOOTH QUANTUM QUENCHES

A. Analytical results

In the previous section, we have focused on the dynamics following a sudden quench of the

interaction. However, both from the theoretical and experimental point of view, it is interesting

to consider the question of how the system may evolve under a smooth quench. In the case of the

LM, it allows to study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system as a function of the rate with

which the interaction is turned on, sudden quenches corresponding to the the fastest rate and the

adiabatic limit to the slowest one. Therefore, the study of the smooth quenches can be used to

compare the eﬀects of a sudden quench to an adiabatic evolution and to better understand the

mechanisms by which quantum many-body systems are driven out of equilibrium. In addition, time

scale which controls the change in the Hamiltonian parameters the non-equilibrium dynamics with

the question how it compares to other characteristic time scales of the problem is an important

input for experiments studying quench dynamics.

Another interesting question that can be addressed in this context is how much the time-evolved

state of the system is reminiscent of the original starting state. In this regard, the Loschmidt echo,

or ﬁdelity in the quantum information-theoretic language, measures the overlap between the state of

the smoothly quenched system and the initial state. This measurement provides direct insight into

the many-body dynamics and the relation between quench dynamics and quantum information.

For a smooth-quench the Hamiltonian becomes explicitly time-dependent:

H(t) =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0(cid:26)ω(q, t)a†(q)a(q) +

1
2

g2(q, t)|q|(cid:104)a(q)a(−q) + a†(q)a†(−q)(cid:105)(cid:27) .

(58)

where ω(q, t) = [vF + g4(q, t)]|q|. The time evolution is described by the Heisenberg equation of
motion:

i∂ta(q, t) = [a(q, t), H(t)] = ω(q, t)a(q, t) + g2(q, t)|q|a†(−q, t),

(59)

and similarly

i∂ta†(−q, t) = −ω(q, t)a†(−q, t) − g2(q, t)|q|a(q, t).

22

(60)

This equation of motion can be solved by a similar ansatz to the one used for the sudden quench:

a(q, t) = f (q, t)a(q) + g(cid:63)(q, t)a†(−q).

(61)

However, in this case the functions f (q, t) and f (q, t) obey the Bogoliubov-deGennes (BdG) equa-

tions of motion:

i∂t

f (q, t)

g(q, t) =

ω(q, t)

−g2(q, t)|q| −ω(q, t)

g2(q, t)|q|

f (q, t)

g(q, t) ,

(62)

which are supplemented by the initial conditions: f (q, 0) = 1 , and g(q, 0) = 0 and the constraint
|f (q, t)|2 − |g(q, t)|2 = 1, which is required by Bose-Einstein statistics. Thus, f (q, t), g(q, t) contain
all the dynamical information about the smooth quench and, as in the case of the sudden quenches,

expectation values of the time-dependent observables can be obtained from their knowledge.

Dora, Haque and Zar´and (DHZ) [62] obtained solutions to the BdG equations for a linear ramp

of the the interaction assuming that ω(q, t) = ω(q) = v0(q)|q| is independent of time and

g2(q, t) = g2(q)Q(t)

(63)

where Q(t) = tΘ(t(t − τ ))/τ + Θ(t − τ ), with Θ(t) the Heaviside function. Note that Q(t > τ ) = 1
and Q(t < 0) = 0, that is, τ determines the characteristic quench time. For τ → 0, a sudden quench
is obtained, while the adiabatic limit is approached by letting τ → ∞. Assuming a perturbatively
small g2(q) = g2e−|q|R/2, DHZ obtained the following asymptotic form for the instantaneous single-
particle density matrix (cf. Eq. 24) for t (cid:29) τ :

2) (v0 = v0(q = 0)) are the (perturbative)

sudden quench and adiabatic-limit exponents. The prefactor A(τ /τ0) depends on the speed of the
quench: For a sudden quench, A(τ /τ0 (cid:28) 1) ∼ 1, while for smooth quench A(τ /τ0 > 1) ∼ (τ /τ0)γad.
The physical explanation for two kinds of behavior displayed in Eq. (64) lies in the following
crossover behavior: When the interaction is quenched at a rate ∼ τ−1, the “slow” excitations of
energy ω(q) < τ−1 experience it as a sudden quench. On the other hand, fast excitations with
energies ω(q) > τ−1 can adjust the the change of the interaction strength adiabatically. Since high

23

(low) energy excitations determine the short (long) distance correlations, the tail of CψR(x, t) is

governed by the sudden quench exponent, whilst its short distance behavior is described by the

adiabatic exponent.

The subject of smooth quenches has often been related to the dynamics across critical points

(see e.g. [3] and references therein). However, for the quench of interaction in LM only one phase

(critical) is involved. For example, for the XXZ model, only the critical region is related to the

LM, and for Bose Hubbard models, LM corresponds to the superﬂuid regime. Therefore, the

Kibble Zurek mechanism, which is related to the production of topological defects when quenching

a system across a critical point, is not relevant for smooth quenches of the interaction in the

LM. Nevertheless, it is possible to discuss the production of quasi-particles in a smooth quench

of the interaction, as it was done by Dziarmaga and Tylukti [68]. The average density of excited
quasiparticles nex scales with τ as nex ∼ τ−1, while the more directly measurable excitation energy
density scales like ε ∼ τ−2 at zero temperature. On the other hand, at ﬁnite temperature ε ∼ τ−1.
At zero temperature, Dziarmaga and Tylukti also showed that the production of excitations does

not change the algebraic x−2 decay of the density (cf. Eq. 32).

Instead (relative to the initial

state), they only yield an additive correction to the prefactor. This behavior contrast with the

exponential decay of the correlations induced by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism following a quench

from a disorder to an ordered phase.

B. Comparison to numerical approaches

As in the case of sudden quenches, the LM predictions for the correlation functions and other

quantities (see below) in the case of a smooth quench have been compared to numerical calculations.

In this section, we review some of the most important results in this regard.

In order to test the correctness of the LM predictions for smooth quench dynamics, Pollmann,

Haque and D´ora (PHD) numerically studied the anisotropic (XXZ) Heisenberg model in the crit-

ical regime by using the inﬁnite time-evolving block decimation algorithm (iTEDB) [27]. They

considered the Hamiltonian:

HXXZ =(cid:88)m (cid:2)(cid:0)Sx

mSx

m+1 + Sy

mSy

m+1(cid:1) + Jz(t)Sz

(65)

assuming antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, i.e. J > 0 and quenching the Ising exchange,

Jz(t) according to Jz(t) = JzQ(t) with Q(t < τ ) = t/τ and Q(t > τ ) = 1. As explained in

section III C, using the Jordan Wigner transformation (see e.g. Refs. [17, 18, 31]) this model can

24

FIG. 5: Post-quench spin-ﬂip correlation function for Jz/J = 0.1 (left panel), 0.2 (middle panel), and 0.4

(right panel) for Jτ = 0, 20.2 and 108.3 (from top to bottom) compared with the Luttinger model prediction

of Eq. (66). At short distances, the numerical results are inﬂuenced by lattice eﬀects, and therefore deviate

from the Luttiger model predictions.

be mapped to an interacting lattice model of spinless fermions in 1D (cf. Eq. 44 with ∆2 = 0).

Bosonization [17, 18] then allows to relate this model to a smooth quench in the LM (cf. 58)
with ω(q) = v|q| (v = J) and g2(q, t) = g2(q)Q(t), g2(q) = g2e−|q|R/2, being R ∼ a0 a short-
distance cut-oﬀ of the order of the lattice parameter a0. R was numerically obtained by PHD to

be R = 0.5622a0. In addition, the value of g2 is ﬁxed using perturbation theory, which requires
that −1 (cid:28) g2/2J = Jz/πJ (cid:28) 1.

The staggered part of the transverse magnetization is given by Eq. (49). Hence, in the scaling
limit where |x|, vτ (cid:29) R after the quench at t = τ , the transverse post-quench correlations can be
evaluated using bosonization to yield:

values of Jz.

In addition to correlation functions, Dora, Pollmann, Fort´agh and Zar´and (DPFZ) have studied

the Loschmidt echo (LE) [63] as a many-body generalization of the orthogonality catastrophe [64].
The LE is deﬁned as the overlap of two wave functions |Ψ0(t)(cid:105) and |Ψ(t)(cid:105) evolved from the same

(67)

In quantum information theory this quantity is also called ﬁdelity , and it is a measure of the dis-

tance between two quantum states which can be used to identify irreversibility and chaos. Moreover,

like entanglement measures, this quantity can be used to detect quantum phase transitions (see

e.g. [2, 65] and references therein).

In their paper on LE, DPFZ considered a quench between two diﬀerent values of the interaction,

which corresponds to setting g2(q, t) = gi(q) + ∆g(q, t) in Eq. (58). Here gi(q) is the initial value
of the interaction, ∆g(q, t) = [gf (q) − gi(q)]Q(t) (where Q(t) has been deﬁned above for a linear
ramp of the interaction), and gf (q) is the ﬁnal value of the interaction. The initial and ﬁnal quasi-
i(f )(q)q2], and the Luttinger parameters are

particle spectra are given by ωi(f )(q) = (cid:113)ω2(q) − g2

characterized by those interaction strengths in the following way:

Thus, DPFZ expressed the LE analytically in terms of the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients of Eq. (62)):

.

ω(q) + gi(f )(q)|q|

Ki(f ) =(cid:115) ω(q) − gi(f )(q)|q|
log(cid:104)|f (q, t)|2(cid:105),
L(t) = exp−(cid:88)q>0

(68)

(69)

which expresses the LE in terms of the number of excited quasi-particles in the ﬁnal state. Using
|f ad(q, t)|2 = 1/2 + (Ki/Kf + Kf /Ki)/4 for t > τ , DHPZ obtained for the the LE in the adiabatic
limit the following expression [66]:

(70)

were L is the system size and and a0 is the short-distance cut-oﬀ. Therefore, the LE decays

exponentially with the system size, L.

On the other hand, for a sudden quench the long time limit of the LE takes a diﬀerent form:

LSQ(cid:18)t (cid:29)

(71)

This can be understood in the following way: The LE of an adiabatic quench involves only the

ground states of the initial and ﬁnal Hamiltonian, i.e., square of the overlap of the ground states
(cid:104)G|G0(cid:105) where |G0(cid:105)(|G(cid:105)) is the ground state of H0(H). For a sudden quench, inserting the resolution

evolution operators in (cid:104)Ψ0|eiHte−iH0t|Ψ0(cid:105), and after taking into account the dephasing of the energy
phase factors of diﬀerent excited states the ground state contribution remains. Asymptotically in
the thermodynamic limits |(cid:104)Ψ0|eiHte−iH0t|Ψ0(cid:105)| = |(cid:104)G|G0(cid:105)|2. Hence, LSQ = |(cid:104)Ψ0|eiHte−iH0t|Ψ0(cid:105)|2 =
|(cid:104)G|G0(cid:105)|4 = L2
ad for t → ∞. These results for the LE were numerically conﬁrmed by DPFZ for the
XXZ spin-chain model using matrix-product states [47].

Considering on a smooth quench of the interaction in a 1D Bose gas which can be described as a

TLL [31], Bernier and coworkers addressed the question how the system is driven out of equilibrium

by an increasing quench rate [67]. Working in the weakly interacting limit, where v(t)K(t) remains
time-independent and u(t)/K(t) = (v0/K0)(1 + τ /τ0) (τ0 = πv0tτ1/K0(gf − gi)), they obtained
solutions of the equations of motion for the Fourier components of the density φ(x, t) and phase

θ(x, t) ﬁelds in terms of Bessel functions. This allowed them to evaluate the phase correlation
functions of the bosons, (cid:104)eiθ(x,t)e−iθ(0,t)(cid:105), which they compared with the numerical results obtained
using td-DMRG [27] for the Bose-Hubbard model [31]. Similarly to Dora et al., they found that, at

short distances, the exponent determining the decay of the correlations with the distance is given

by the results for adiabatic quench, while for long distances, correlations decay with a power-law

exponent approaching the sudden quench value. The long distance regime is separated from an

intermediate distance using a generalized Lieb-Robinson bound [23], that is, a length scale deﬁned
0πτ /[Ki(gf − gi)] [67]. This behavior can be regarded as

0 dt(cid:48)v(q = 0, t(cid:48)) with l0 = v2

as ξB = 2/l0(cid:82) t

a generalization of the the light-cone-eﬀect discussed above for the sudden quenches.

V. STEADY STATE AND THE GENERALIZED GIBBS ENSEMBLE

As described in section III A, one of the main motivations for the study of a quantum quench

of the interaction in the LM was to ﬁnd an analytically tractable model for which it is possible to

demonstrate the absence of thermalization. Indeed, it turns out that the LM provides an excellent

toy model to understand this phenomenon. As we discuss in this section, it also provides an

excellent playground to understand the emergence of the Generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) as

an eﬀective description of the correlations in the steady state ofollowing the quantum quench.

In order to gain a broader perspective, let us ﬁrst discuss the GGE as it was originally intro-

duced [19]. Rigol and coworkers noticed that dynamics of integrable models is strongly constrained

by the presence of a large number of integrals of motion, I(q) ([H, I(q)] = 0, where H is the

post-quench Hamiltonian). Thus, relying on Jaynes’s fundational work on statistical mechanics,

they proposed that the steady steady state of integrable models following a quantum quench is

described by the following density matrix:

ρGGE =

(cid:80)

e−

q λ(q)I(q)

ZGGE

.

27

(72)

This result can be obtained by maximizing the von Neumann entropy S = − Tr [ρ log ρ] subject to
the constraints imposed by the conservation of the I(q). Note that if the set of integrals of motion

includes only the total energy H and particle number N , the resulting density matrix is the Gibbs’

grand canonical ensemble [56]. In such a case, the Lagrange multipliers λ(q) correspond to the

familiar inverse absolute temperature β = 1/T and the ratio of (minus) the chemical potential
to the absolute temperature, −µ/T . However, in general, as it is the case of integrable systems,
the set of conserved quantities is larger than {H, N}, and more λ(q) are required. The latter are
determined from the initial conditions by requiring that

(cid:104)I(q)(cid:105)GGE = Tr ρGGEI(q) = Tr ρ0I(q) = (cid:104)I(q)(cid:105)0,

(73)

where ρ0 is the density matrix describing the initial state. Rigol and coworkers have provided

convincing numerical evidence for the GGE by performing a careful numerical analysis of several

types of quenches in the lattice hardcore Bose gas [19, 58, 59]. For this system, they identiﬁed [19]

the set of integrals of motion I(q) to be the occupation operators of the eigenmodes of the system,

which are the occupations of the Jordan-Wigner fermions in momentum space [31]. Subsequently,

an analytical proof that the GGE describes the correlations in the asymptotic state of the quenched

LM model was provided in Ref. [21].

Yet, the eﬀectiveness of the GGE description must be regarded as something rather non-obvious

and even striking. It is striking that a density matrix corresponding to a mixed state can describe

the result of the unitary evolution of a pure state such as the ground state of the non-interacting

LM [93]. It is also not obvious that the number of integrals of motion required to construct the

GGE is only a particular subset of all the possible integrals of motion of the model. Some answers

to these questions can be extracted from the theory of quantum entanglement.

As we have seen above, quantum entanglement plays a important role in the physics of quantum

quenches. The light-cone eﬀect described in section III B can be traced back to the propagation

of entangled pairs of quasi-particles. In addition, we will see below that the GGE emerges as a

consequence of decoherence caused by the time evolution which erases all but a certain kind of

correlations that exist amongst the eigenmodes in the initial state of the system. This observation

is applicable to a certain class of initial states, known as gaussian states, which are deﬁned further

below in this section. However, before discussing the connections between the GGE and entan-

28

glement, it is worth providing a short pedagogical introduction to the most important concepts of

entanglement theory, which is undertaken in the following section.

A. Entanglement, reduced density matrices, and entanglement spectra

Entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics. It was introduced

by Schr¨odinger when he used the German word “Verschr¨ankung” (translated into English as “en-

tanglement”) to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate

when addressing the paradox pointed out by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) [42]. The EPR

paradox arose because of the counter-intuitive non-locality of quantum mechanics. It was meant as

thought experiment to explicitly to demonstrate the incompleteness of the nonclassical theory. In

order to address the controversy that ensued between EPR, on one side, and Bohr on the other side,

Bell derived a set of inequalities [43] which should be obeyed if reality was local and entanglement

did not exist. The violation of Bell inequalities by quantum mechanics could thus demonstrated

experimentally, which eventually was accomplished in a series of pioneering experiments carried

out by the team led by Aspect [46]. Up to this point in time, the majority of experiments show the

correctness of quantum mechanics and therefore the existence of entanglement. More recently, en-

tanglement has been realized to be an important resource for quantum computation and quantum

communication [44]. The exploitation of entangled pair as an ebit (entangled qubit) can speed up

quantum computation and communication. Indeed, some quantum information processes such as

quantum teleportation rely heavily on the use of ebits.

In the last two decades, quantum information-theoretic concepts have also had a strong inﬂuence

on many fundamental aspects of condensed matter theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum

ﬁeld theory [45]. This so-called many-body theory has used entanglement as a new tool to study

condensed matter theory, especially for the numerical calculations of strongly correlated system at

zero temperature. The success of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [47] and other

methods based on the tensor network such as matrix product states (MPS) in one dimension [47, 48]

lies on the fact that the entanglement between subsystems in one dimension is essentially small

[49]. The understanding of the entanglement has provided new insights, for example, into critical

phenomena, where it has been shown that entanglement can diverge just like the susceptibility

at a second-order critical point [50], and the scaling of the entanglement entropy (see below for a

deﬁnition) can provide a new way to calculate the central charge [49].

As mentioned above, entanglement can also be applied to gain deeper understanding of quench

29

dynamics, and in particular, the emergence of the GGE. The point of view of how the GGE emerges

from the correlations between the eigenmodes of the (post-quench) Hamiltonian was arrived at

beginning with the work on the LM [21], and culminating with the work reported in Ref. [53],

which involved the authors of the present work. In order to introduce the main ideas of Ref. [53]

and their application to quenches in the LM, let us start by reviewing some results about reduce

density matrices. For a bipartite system where the system is divided into a subsystem part, A,
and an environment part, B, a density matrix ρ0 = |ΨAB(cid:105)(cid:104)ΨAB| can be obtained from a pure state
|ΨAB(cid:105) describing the composite AB system. The reduced density matrix ρA obtained by tracing
out the environment:

ρA = TrB ρ0 = TrB |ΨAB(cid:105)(cid:104)ΨAB|.

(74)

The Hermitian operator ρA is interesting for various reasons. First, it allows to obtain the von

Neumann entanglement entropy of the subsystem A by means of the expression:

SA = − Tr ρA log ρA.

(75)

This measure of entanglement is central to quantum information theory. One of the reasons is

that, as shown by Wooters and coworkers, under local operations and classical communication

(LOCC, i.e. a local unitary transformation), an entangled state of a bi-partite system can only be

transformed into a state with the same or lower entanglement entropy [54]. In addition, reduced

density matrices are used to eﬃciently truncate the Hilbert space basis for the density matrix

renormalization group based methods [27, 47]. An important result about the entanglement entropy

is the way it scales with the size of the subsystem A. The area law [55] states that for a subsystem
of dimension d, SA(d) ∝ Ld−1 (for critical systems a logarithmic correction also appears). The
area law is the fundamental reason why DMRG is so eﬃcient in 1D since the entanglement entropy

grows at most as log L.

Rather than focusing on the entanglement entropy, much more structure can be found in the

eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, namely, the entanglement spectrum. The latter can be

obtained by diagonalizing the entanglement Hamiltonian, H ent

A [51, 57], which is deﬁned through

the relation:

ρA =

A

e−H ent
Tr e−H ent

A

.

(76)

Note that the basis that diagonalizes H ent

A also diagonalizes ρA. Next, let us focus our discussion of

entanglement spectra of systems described by a Hamiltonian that is quadratic in terms of certain

(fermionic or bosonic) quasi-particle operators (as is the case of the LM), bγ and b†γ, i.e.

H0 =(cid:88)γδ (cid:20)Aγδb†γbδ +

1
2

(Bγδb†γb†δ + h.c.)(cid:21)

30

(77)

In the above expression γ, δ are the quasi-particle quantum numbers, which can be coordinates,

wave vectors, etc. The reduced density of such models can be obtained by ﬁrst obtaining a coherent

state representation of the the matrix elements of the full density matrix ρ0 [60] and then explicitly

integrating out the degrees of freedom of the environment. In this way the reduced density matrix

ρA can be separated as a direct product form [57, 61]:

(cid:80)
(cid:80)

e−
Tr e−

ρA =

m λmα†mαm

m λmα†mαm

(78)

where α†m (αm) are the creation (annihilation) operators that diagonalize the entanglement Hamil-
tonian, H ent

A . The single-particle entanglement spectrum is given by

λm = log

1 ± µm
µm

,

where µm are the eigenvalues of the block correlation function matrix

Gγδ = Tr ρ0 b†γbδ,

(79)

(80)

where the quantum numbers α and β are restricted to the subsystem A. The plus (minus) sign

in Eq. (79) applies to bosons (fermions). We will see below, in section V B, that the GGE can be

obtained as product of reduced density matrices of the form of Eq. (78).

The above results apply only to the case that the state of the system can be described by a

Gaussian density matrix, ρ0, which in the pure state case can be regarded as the ground state

of a quadratic Hamiltonian. Otherwise the block correlation function matrix is not enough to

describe the entanglement due to the failure of the Wick theorem. The results for the entanglement

spectrum also apply to mixed Gaussian density matrices, such as, for example a thermal density
matrix ρ0 ∝ e−H0/T , where T is the absolute temperature and H0 is a quadratic Hamiltonian.
However, in this case, the expression for von Neumann entropy of ρA Eq. (75) cannot be used to

calculate the entanglement due to the additional thermal contribution to the entropy.

B. GGE and the steady state of the Luttinger Model

In this subsection, we shall consider a quantum quench in the Luttinger model (LM) and show
why the GGE provides a description of the asymptotic steady state at t → +∞ from the perspective

of entanglement [53]. The initial state of the quench is assumed to a gaussian state ρ0 ∝ e−H0/T
(the pure state case is obtained by letting T → 0). A general form for the pre-quench Hamiltonian
H0 is:

31

[0(q)δq,q(cid:48) + V0(q, q(cid:48))]b†(q)b(q(cid:48))

H0 = (cid:88)q,q(cid:48)
+(cid:88)q,q(cid:48)

[∆(cid:63)

0(q, q(cid:48))b(q)b(q(cid:48)) + ∆0(q, q(cid:48))b†(q(cid:48))b†(q)].

(81)

To keep our discussion general and connect to the discussion in the previous section, we shall

consider that H0 is not translational invariant and couples diﬀerent wave numbers by means of the
potentials V0(q, q(cid:48)) and ∆0(q, q(cid:48)). Therefore the initial state ρ0 breaks the translational invariance

of the system. We assume a sudden quench where at t = 0, the Hamiltonian becomes diagonal in

the modes described by b(q) and b†(q) (cf. HLM in Eq. 54).

Gaussian initial states like ρ0 have the important property that Wick’s theorem allows us to
obtain the correlators of an arbitrary product of b(q) and b†(q) eigenmode operators from two-point
correlation functions, e.g. (cid:104)b†(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105)0 = Tr ρ0b†(q)b(q(cid:48)),(cid:104)b(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105)0 and (cid:104)b†(q)b†(q(cid:48))(cid:105), et cetera. In
addition, another useful property of Gaussian states, which was described in the previous section,

is that the reduced density matrices of an arbitrary partition of the system are also Gaussian. In

particular, if we choose a partition where the sub-system A is one of the modes, say, q and the
environment B is the rest q(cid:48) (cid:54)= q, then, tracing the environment yields

ρ(q) = TrB ρ0 = Trq(cid:54)=q(cid:48) ρ0 =

e−λ(q)I(q)

Z(q)

,

(82)

where I(q) = b†(q)b(q) is the quasiparticle occupation operator. For this particular partition the

entanglement Hamiltonian equals λ(q)I(q) and λ(q) is the single-mode entanglement spectrum,
which related to the occupation number of the density matrix (cf. Eq. 79), n(q) = (cid:104)I(q)(cid:105) =
Tr ρ0I(q) = Tr ρ0b†(q)b(q) by means of the relation:

λ(q) = log

1 ± n(q)
n(q)

.

(83)

The claim (to be substantiated below) is that the GGE can be constructed as a product of such

single-model reduced density matrices, i.e.

ρGGE =(cid:79)q

ρ(q).

(84)

Indeed, for the relevant local and non-local operators, decoherence erases the dependence of the
correlators on the oﬀ-diagonal eigenmode correlations [53] of the type (cid:104)b†(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105) (for q (cid:54)= q(cid:48)),

32

(cid:104)b(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105), etc. Thus, if all relevant correlators depend only on the n(q) = (cid:104)I(q)(cid:105), taking the
expectation value over the GGE and over ρ0 yield the same result. However, this point of view

of the GGE is tantamount to the mathematical statement that each eigenmode acquires a mode-
dependent eﬀective temperature T (q) = λ(q)/ [v(q)|q|] as a result of its entanglement with other
eigenmodes in the initial state of the system.

Next, we discuss how the GGE emerges in the LM. In order to make connection with the

previous discussion about quenches of the interaction, we shall consider in the following transla-

tional invariant initial states. Thus, we focus on gaussian states that are obtained from the initial

Hamiltonians of the form:

H0 =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0(cid:26)v0(q)|q|b†(q)b(q) +

1
2

g0(q)|q|(cid:104)b†(q)b†(−q) + b(q)b(−q)(cid:105)(cid:27) ,

(85)

which respects translational invariance. For a quench of the interaction, v0(q) = vF cosh 2ϕ(q) and

g0(q) = vF sinh 2ϕ(q), as follows from Eq. (9) (ϕ(q) is the Bogoliubov angle). Furthermore, since

the observables in which we are interested can be expressed in terms of the boson ﬁeld φα=R,L(x)

(cf. Eq. (15)), we rewrite this operator in terms of the eigenmodes of post-quench Hamiltonian,

HLM , which yields:

Φα(x, t) =(cid:88)q>0(cid:18) 2π
qL(cid:19) 1

2

φα(x) = sαφα +

2πx
L

eisαq[cosh ϕ(q)e−iv(q)|q|tb(sαq) − sinh ϕ(q)eiv(q)|q|tb†(−sαq)],

Nα + Φα(x) + Φ†α(x).

(86)

(87)

In the LM and for gaussian states like ρ0, correlation functions of vertex operators can be expressed

in term of two-point correlations of the ﬁelds φα(x, t). For the vertex operators, the key identity

allowing for the evaluation of the vertex-operator correlation functions is the following:

(cid:104)eiAα(x1,...,xn,t)(cid:105)0 = Tr(cid:104)ρ0eiAα(x1,...,xn,t)(cid:105) = e− 1

2(cid:104)A2

α(x1,...,xn,t)(cid:105)0,

(88)

(89)

where

Aα(x1, . . . , xn, t) =

piφα(xi, t),

n(cid:88)i=1

with (cid:80) pi = 0. The proof of this identity relies on Wick’s theorem [94]. By the same token,

correlation functions of ρα(x) = ∂xφα(x)/2π can be obtained. Note that φα(x) itself is not an

observable. However, observables in the LM are related to correlation functions of ρα(x) and

vertex operators. Despite this fact, the correlations of φα(x) play a central role in the LM, as

33

we have just shown. For example, using Eq. (88), the two-point correlation function of the right

moving Fermi ﬁelds

CψR(x, t) = (cid:104)ψ†R(x, t)ψR(0, t)(cid:105)0 = Tr(cid:104)ρ0ψ†R(x, t)ψR(0, t)(cid:105)

= A exp [CφR(x, t) − CφR(0, t)],

(90)

(91)

where A is a cut-oﬀ dependent prefactor. Thus, because of Wick’s theorem, it is suﬃcient to
consider the two-point correlations of φα(x, t), which, using (87), can be written as follows:

CφR(x, t) = (cid:104)φR(x, t)φR(0, t)(cid:105)0 = DφR(x) + FφR(x, t),

where

π

DφR(x) =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is the contribution of the diagonal correlations of the eigenmodes in the initial state n(q) =
(cid:104)b†(q)b(q)(cid:105)0. Furthermore,
π

qL(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) [cosh 2ϕ(q) + sgn(q)](cid:8)eiqx[1 + n(q)] + e−iqxn(q)(cid:9)
qL(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) [cosh 2ϕ(q) + sgn(q)](cid:104)eiqx−2iv(q)|q|t∆(q) + eiqx+2iv(q)|q|t∆(cid:63)(q)(cid:105) ,

FφR(x, t) =(cid:88)q(cid:54)=0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where ∆(q) = (cid:104)b(q)b(−q)(cid:105)0 is related to the anomalous correlations of the eigenmodes in the initial
state. Due to the translation invariance, n(q) and ∆(q) are the only non-vanishing two-point

correlations of the eigenmodes in the initial state.

At this point, we are ready to show that the correlation functions of the LM only depend on the

diagonal correlations, n(q). To this end, we notice that, whereas the contribution of the diagonal

correlations n(q) is time independent, the contribution of the anomalous terms depends on time.

Hence, because of dephasing between the diﬀerent Fourier components (mathematically, by the

Riemann-Lebesgue lemma), in the thermodynamic limit, the contribution of FφR(x, t) vanishes as
t → +∞. Explicitly, at zero temperature (T = 0), for the quench of the interaction in the LM,

(92)

(93)

(94)

(95)

FφR(x, t) − FφR(0, t) ∼ log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2vt)2 − x2

(2vt)2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),

which vanishes as t → +∞ (provided x is kept ﬁnite). This implies that all correlations are
asymptotically determined by DφR(x), which depends only on n(q) = (cid:104)b†(q)b(q)(cid:105)0. This observation
allows to trace out all the q(cid:48) (cid:54)= q eigenmodes since n(q) = Tr(cid:2)ρ0b†(q)b(q)(cid:3) = Tr[ρ(q)b†(q)b(q)] =

Tr ρGGEb†(q)b(q). Thus, we arrive at the same result as if we had used the GGE density matrix

ρGGE = (cid:78)q ρ(q). Hence, CφR(x, t → +∞) − CφR(x, 0) = CGGE

Tr [ρGGEφR(x)φR(0)], and using Eq. (91) yields:

t→+∞

(96)

It is worth noting that the translational invariant initial state implies that eigenmode corre-
lations are bipartite, that is, each mode at q is entangled only with the eigenmode at −q (see
next section). Thus, we can regard the eﬀective temperature T (q) for the eigenmodes with q as
the result of their quantum correlations with the −q eigenmodes and vice versa. However, the
translational invariance of initial states is not a necessary condition for the long time correlations

to be described by the GGE. If the translational-invariance constraint is relaxed, dephasing will
still erase the oﬀ diagonal correlations, not only the “anomalous” ones (cid:104)b(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105)0 but also the
normal ones (cid:104)b†(q)b(q(cid:48))(cid:105) (q(cid:48) (cid:54)= q) because they always appear in the correlators multiplied by phase
factors of the form ei[v(q)|q|±v(q(cid:48))|q(cid:48)|]|t, which oscillate very rapidly for t → ∞ and therefore yield a

vanishing contribution. This is essentially the reason why the GGE is so eﬀective for describing

the asymptotic state correlations. Furthermore, it also shows why only the occupation operators

of the eigenmodes (quasi-particles) of the post-quench Hamiltonian, i.e., I(q) = b†(q)b(q), are the

only integrals of motion required for its construction.

Similar ideas has been extended in Ref. [53] to other exactly solvable models in one dimension,

such as the quantum Ising model and the XX model in order to show that, in the thermodynamic

limit, they relax to the GGE. They have been also applied to understand the the pre-thermalized

state of a 2D Fermi gas in terms of the GGE by Nessi, Iucci, and Cazalilla [39] (cf. section III D).

C. Entanglement spectra from generalized Gibbs

In the previous section we have discussed how the GGE emerges from dephasing and the diag-

onal correlations between the eigenmodes. We have pointed that LM is a system with bipartite

eigenmode entanglement due to the coupling of the right moving (q > 0) and the left moving

(q < 0) Tomonaga bosons that is mediated through the interaction. For systems with bipartite

entanglement, relaxation to the GGE can be discussed on general grounds. This interpretation

might allow for the experimental possibility to measure the entanglement spectrum by studying

the steady state of post-quench correlations[41].

Let us consider a general system consisting of two subsystems A and B. For t > 0, the

Hamiltonian of the system is quenched to a Hamiltonian of the form:

H0 = HA + HB + HAB

35

(97)

where HA, HB and HAB are quadratic in some eigenmodes α(q), β(q) which carry a quantum

number q and can be bosonic or fermionic (at this point we consider both, for the sake of generality),

i.e.

HA = (cid:88)q
HB = (cid:88)q
HAB = (cid:88)q

εA(q)α†(q)α(q),

εB(q)β†(q)β(q)

∆AB(q)(cid:104)α†(q)β(q) + β†(q)α(q)(cid:105) .

(98)

(99)

(100)

We assume that the system is prepared in a thermal initial density matrix (ρ0 = Z−1

0 e−H0/T ).
For t > 0, the coupling between the two systems HAB disappears, and the two subsystems evolve

unitarily and are uncoupled according the Hamiltonian H = HA + HB. The existence of the
coupling HAB for all t ≤ 0 means that in the initial state ρ0, there are correlations (i.e. bipartite
entanglement) between the eigen modes, i.e. (cid:104)α†(q)β(q)(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0.

From the discussion in the last subsection, we have seen that the GGE is equivalent to an

eﬀective description of correlations that, in the asymptotic long time steady state, only depend on

the diagonal correlations of the eigenmodes. The latter are entirely parametrized by an eﬀective

temperature, resulting from entanglement with the other modes, and which determines the reduced

density matrix of the eigenmode. When the correlations are bi-partite, we can regard the eﬀective

temperature for the modes in the subsystem A as due to the entanglement with the modes in the
subsystem B (and vice versa). Thus whenever we are dealing with (cid:104)α†(q)α(q)(cid:105) = Tr ρ0α†(q)α(q)
and (cid:104)β†(q)β(q)(cid:105) = Tr ρ0β†(q)β(q) we can trace out one of the subsystems and obtain

nα(q) = (cid:104)α†(q)α(q)(cid:105) = Tr ρAα†(q)α(q) = ρGGEα†(q)α(q),
nβ(q) = (cid:104)β†(q)β(q)(cid:105) = Tr ρAβ†(q)β(q) = ρGGEβ†(q)β(q),

where ρA = TrB ρ0 and ρB = TrA ρ0. Therefore ρGGE is written as

ρGGE = Z−1

GGE exp(cid:40)−(cid:88)q (cid:104)λα(q)α†(q)α(a) + λβ(q)β†(q)β(q)(cid:105)(cid:41)

with the Langrange multipliers λα(q) = log [1 ± nα(q)/nα(q)] and λβ(q) = log [1 ± nβ(q)/nβ(q)]
(plus sign for bosons and minus sign for fermions). Therefore the GGE density matrix can be

written as

ρGGE = ρA ⊗ ρB.

36

(104)

We regard the result as a way to related the density matrix of GGE to the reduced density matrix,

and hence to the entanglement Hamiltonian by Eq. (76). Thus we see ρGGE is determined by the

total entanglement Hamiltonian as H = H ent

A + H ent

B , where

H ent

A = (cid:88)q
B = (cid:88)q

λα(q)α†(q)α(q) =(cid:88)q
λβ(q)β†(q)β(q) =(cid:88)q

log(cid:104)(1 ± nβ(q))/nβ(q)(cid:105)β†(q)β(q),

(105)

(106)

H ent

which, by comparison with Eq. (103), allows us to identify λα(q) and λβ(q) as the entanglement

spectrum of the subsystems A and B.

Therefore the entanglement spectra determine the asymptotic state following a quantum quench.

We can therefore obtain the entanglement spectra and entropy by measuring the behavior after a

quench process. In the following we show that the entanglement spectra of the LM can be accessed

by the quantum sudden quench.

For the sake of deﬁniteness, let us next consider initial states corresponding to constant v0 and

g0(q) = (∆/2π). Therefore, the initial Hamiltonian reads

H0 =(cid:88)q>0(cid:20)v0q(α†(q)α(q) + β†(q)β(q)) +

∆
2π

q(α†(q)β†(q) + β(q)α(q))(cid:21)

(107)

with the redeﬁnition of the operators α(q) = b(q) and β(q) = b(−q). Essentially Eq.(107) and
Eq.(97) are the same by applying particle hole transformation for the system B.

Eq.(107) is diagonalized by a canonical transformation where a(q) = cosh ϕ(q)α(q) −
sinh ϕ(q)β†(q), a(−q) = − sinh ϕ(q)α(q) + cosh ϕ(q)β†(q) and choosing tanh 2ϕ(q) = −∆/(2πv0),
the initial Hamiltonian reads:

H0 =(cid:88)q>0

v(q)q(a†(q)a(q) + a†(−q)a(−q))

(108)

where v(q) = v0(cid:112)(1 − (∆/2πv0)2). In order to obtain the entanglement spectra λα and λβ, the
occupation number are used: nα(q) = nβ(q) = sinh2 ϕ(q) = 1/2(v0/v(q) − 1). Hence

λα = λβ = log(cid:18) v0 + v(q)
where ε = 2[log(2πv0)/∆ +(cid:112)(2πv0/∆)2 − 1] is a constant. Therefore the entanglement Hamilto-
B =(cid:80)q εβ†(q)β(q). The lowest entanglement eigenvalue is 0.

A =(cid:80)q εα†(q)α(q) and H ent

v0 − v(q)(cid:19) = ε,

37

There is also a ‘ﬂat band’ of entaglement eigenvalues of ε. This kind of spectra may be extracted

by the experimental determination of the eigenmode dependent temperatures that parameterize

the GGE in an interaction quench of the LM.

D. Non-gaussian initial states

From the discussions above the Gaussian initial state ρ0 is needed to prove GGE correct. On the

contrary, Dinh, Bagrets, and Mirlin (DBM) [69] studied a sudden quench of the interaction in LM

assuming a double-step initial momentum distribution function of the fermions (a situation relevant

to experiments in the quantum Hall regime of the two-dimensional electron gas, see section VII B
and references). Using non-equilibrium bosonization, they obtained the steady state energy (∝
momentum) distribution. DBM pointed out that the resulting steady state distribution cannot be

obtained from the GGE. The latter, at large distances, predicts an exponential decay of single-

particle density matrix, i.e. [69]:

CψR(x) ≈ C(0)

e−κ|x|,

(110)

−α

ψR(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

R

x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where α and κ depend on the interaction and details of the initial state. The reason why GGE fails

in this case is because the initial state contains a non-Gaussian correlations amongst the bosonic

eigemodes of the system. This kind of non-Gaussian memory survives in the steady state. A similar

conclusion has been reached by Sotiriadis for general initial non-Gaussian states using conformal

ﬁeld theory methods [70].

VI. BRIEF SURVEY OF LUTTINGER’S RELATIVES

Various kinds of perturbations to the LM have been considered as well as their various eﬀects

on the quench dynamics. The number of possible perturbations is rather large, and given the space

constraints, we cannot make justice to all the recent developments in this area. We merely mention

the most relevant here.

A. Quenches in the sine-Gordon model

A well known perturbation to the LM is the sine-Gordon model , e.g.

HSGM = HT LL + g(t)(cid:90) dx cos 2φ(x),

(111)

38

where HT LL is the ﬁxed-point Hamiltonian in Eq. (20). Assuming g(t) = gθ(t), for instance,

this model describes the sudden application to the LM of an external periodic potential that is

commensurate with half the Fermi wave number π/pF (recall pF is the Fermi momentum) [18, 31].
The model has also a dual version where 2φ → θ in the cosine term, which describes a quench
of the Josephson coupling [18, 31]. In equilibrium (i.e. for a time-independent coupling g(t)) the
cosine perturbation is relevant in the renormalization group sense for K (cid:46) 2 (for inﬁnitesimal

g) [17, 18, 31], which opens a spectral gap. For K > 2, the perturbation is irrelevant and the low

energy spectrum is thus gapless and adiabatically connected to the LM spectrum (up to corrections

that rapidly decrease with the excitation energy).

Like the LM, quantum quenches in the sine-Gordon model have also attracted much attention.
Iucci and Cazalilla [73] studied a sudden quench of the cosine term where g(t) = gθ(−t) in the
so-called harmonic limit (holding for K (cid:28) 1) and at the so-called Luther-Emery line [11] (corre-
sponding to K = 1 [31] for Eq. 111). The results are entirely consistent with the general results

of Cardy and Calabrese [24] for a quench from an oﬀ critical to a critical Hamiltonian. Iucci and

Cazalilla also showed that in both the harmonic limit and the Luther-Emery line the system relaxes

to the GGE. In addition, the reverse quench (from critical to non-critical) was also analyzed in

Ref. [73]. Applications of the quench of the sine-Gordon to the experiments in Schmiedmayer’s

group have been discussed also recently by Dalla Torre, Demler, and Polkovnikov [74], and by Foini

and Giamarchi [75].

Smooth quantum quenches where the coupling g(t) ∼ tr have been studied by De Grandi,
Gritsev, and Polkovnikov (GGP) [76], who focused on the dynamics near (i.e. starting from or

ending at) the critical point between the gapped and gapless phases. By changing the exponent r,
it is possible to interpolate between the sudden quench (r → 0) and the adiabatic quench limit (for
r → ∞). In between, for the linear quench r = 1, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism can be studied.
Rather than the dynamics of correlations, GGP focused on the production rate of excitations, Pex,

the density of the quasiparticles nex, the diagonal entropy Sd and the heat (the excess energy above

the new ground state of the post-quench Hamiltonian) Q. They showed that the scaling of Pex,

nex and Sd are associated with the singularities of the generalized adiabatic susceptibility χ2r+2(λ)

of order 2r + 2 deﬁned as

χm(λ) =

1

Ld(cid:88)n(cid:54)=0

|(cid:104)n|V |0(cid:105)|2

[En(λ) − E0(λ)]m

(112)

where a d-dimensional perturbative Hamiltonian H(λ) = H0 + λV is considered with the eigenen-
ergy En of the state |n(cid:105), while if the quench ends at the critical point the scaling of Q is related

39

to χ2r+1 [76]. For a sudden quench, i.e. r = 0, χ2r+2(λ) is reduced to the ﬁdelity susceptibility
χ2 ≡ χf . In two exactly solvable limits: the massive bosons (i.e. the harmonic limit) and the mas-
sive fermions, they also obtained results for quenches at ﬁnite temperature. Due to the statistics of

the quasiparticles, they showed that the structure of the singularity remains the same except that
for nex and Q, the dimensionality d is replaced by d− z, where z is dynamical exponent for bosons.
On the other hand, for fermions d → d+z. The diﬀerence stems from the bunching of bosons, which
enhances non-adiabatic eﬀects, whereas anti-bunching of fermions suppresses transitions [76].

B. Long-ranged hoping models

Other systems that are attracting much interest in recent times in connection with experiments

in ion traps are models with long-ranged interactions (see e.g. Ref. [80]). We have already discussed

how long-ranged interactions aﬀect the post-quench correlations of the LM [26]. Other types of

interactions may correspond to a long-range hoping of bosons in a lattice, which translates into a

long-ranged Heisenberg exchange for spins. Tezuka, Garc´ıa-Garc´ıa and Cazalilla (TGC) studied

a quench of the range of the boson hoping, focusing on the dynamics of the condensate [77].
tr ∼ |r|−κ, the system
exhibits long range order at zero temperature for κ < 3 (up to interaction-induced corrections) [78,

When hoping amplitude decays as a power-law of the distance r, i.e.

79]. Quenching the power-law tail of the hoping amplitude (or, equivalently, the value of κ) is

tantamount to changing the eﬀective dimensionality of the system [77]. Using bosonization [31],

TGC obtained that the condensate fraction (normalized to the initial state fraction) f (t) decays at
short times as f (t) = 1− bt2 and at long times as a stretched exponential f (t) ∼ e−ct
and c depend on the model parameters like lattice ﬁlling, interaction, etc. These predictions were

, where b

found to be in reasonable agreement [77] with numerical results obtained using td-DMRG, despite

the fact that the bosonization treatment does not take into account the possibility of phase slips,

which may be required in order to achieve a complete understanding of the dynamical destruction

of the condensate following the quench of the hoping range.

C. To thermalize or to not thermalize

There is a great deal of evidence that observables of generic, non-integrable isolated systems

relax to a state that can described by a standard thermal equilibrium ensemble [81, 82] (see also

Ref. [4] and references therein). Thus, for such a generic systems, the LM results that we have

40

reviewed above should break down at suﬃcient long times. Correlations are therefore expected

to crossover to their thermal averages (e.g. Eq. 34). Thermalization being impossible to avoid in

most cases, the question is therefore one of relaxation dynamics and time scales. And the latter

can be very long due to the limited available phase space for quasi-particle scattering in especially

one-dimensional systems [95].

In the intermediate time-regime, before the crossover to thermal behavior takes place, the LM

predictions should be accurate provided the system is not strongly excited at the outset in the

quench process. This expectation is based on the observation that, even if the high excited states

of a generic, non-integrable model are highly chaotic [4], the low-energy part of spectrum may still

retain some features that can be captured by a suitable exactly solvable model like the LM.

It becomes therefore apparent that the results described above should describe some kind of pre-

thermal state, which exists for some time, and which crosses over at a later time to a fully thermal

state. How this happens and what kind of perturbations to the LM drive such thermalization is

still very much under debate (although a number of important results have emerged recently, see

below).

A ﬁrst attempt to understand how terms that have been neglected by the use of TLL ﬁxed-

point (i.e. the LM) Hamiltonian to describe the quench dynamics was undertaken by Mitra and

Giamarchi [22]. Using the non-equilibrium Green’s function (Keldysh) formalism, and assuming

that a non-linearity in the form of a sine-Gordon term (cf. Eq. 111) is adiabatically switched-on

following an interaction quench, they showed that the system would eventually reach a thermal

state. In other words, the coupling between the eigenmodes due to the sine-Gordon term introduces

quasi-particle scattering that violates the inﬁnite conservation laws of the LM and relaxes the

system to a thermal state.

Nevertheless, intrinsic sources of scattering between quasi-particles are present in most models

of the TLL class at all times. One of them is the curvature in the fermion dispersion, whichin

bosonized form reads [14]:

Hm =

1

m(cid:90) dx (∂θ)2 ∂xφ.

(113)

The eﬀects on the post-quench dynamics of the resonant scattering of Tomonaga bosons caused

by Eq. 113 have been recently addressed by Buchhold, Heyl, and Diehl (BHD) [83]. By using

non-equilibrium Green’s functions, BHD wrote a quantum kinetic equation for the Tomonaga

bosons in the presence of collisions mediated by the Eq. (113). From the numerical solution of the

kinetic equation, the following picture for the fermion single-particle correlation function emerges:

Besides the two regimes that have been discussed in section III, which are called pre-quench and

pre-thermal by the authors of Ref. [83], a new regime, termed ‘thermal’ appears. In the thermal

regime, CψR(x, t) exhibits an exponential decay with distance. Thus, summarizing BHD’s results

for a quench of the interaction starting from the non-interacting ground state, the following three

41

distinct regimes exist:

CψR(x, t) =

In the pre-quench regime (i.e.

Z(t)C(0)
ψR

(x, t), Z(t) ∼ t−γ2

(x) (cid:39)(cid:12)(cid:12) R

ψR
e−|x|/ξth[T (t)]

0 < t < tx = |x|/2v,

tx < t < tth

t > tth.

(114)

for t < tx), correlations are only multiplicatively modiﬁed from

their initial state values. The pre-thermalized regime corresponds to t > tx = 2vt. In this regime,

the dynamics is controlled by the exactly solvable truncation of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. HLM .

In this regard, HLM plays a similar role to the exactly solvable truncation of the interacting 2D

Fermi gas discussed in section III D. In other words, the exactly solvable models describe a regime

of ‘inertial response’ to the quench of the interaction, in which quasi-particles are formed before

they can start to scatter each other.

The ﬁnal (“thermal”) regime is takes places for t > tth. The thermalization time tth (cid:39)
t0(x/R)1/α(K), where 0 < α(K) < 1 and β(K) are functions of the Luttinger parameter, K,

that need to be determined numerically [83] (R is the interaction range, which eﬀectively plays

the role of momentum cut-oﬀ, see section II). The curvature, Eq. (113), leads to the emergence of

a new time scale in the problem t0 = R2/w0 ∼ mR2, where w0 ∼ 1/m√K is the strength of the

interaction-vertex arising from Eq. (113). BHD also pointed that the existence of the thermalized

regime and the diﬀerent scaling of the time (or equivalently, length) scales that determine them,

implies the existence of a minimum time or distance below which the pre-thermalized behavior

cannot be observed. This distance, xm is found by equating 2vtm = β(K)R(t/t0)α(K) [83] and
hence xm = 2vtm, and |x| < xm the quasi-particles with short wavelength have not formed before
they begin to scatter each other. Thus, below this length scale the system correlations will behave

either as in the pre-quench or in the thermal regime.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the thermal regime is a stationary state only asymptoti-

cally. This is because the correlation length ξth[T (t)] = K/(1 + K2) (v/πT (t)), where the eﬀective
temperature T (t) = T +∆(K)(v/R)(t/t0)−µ, where T is the ﬁnal temperature of the system, ∆(K)

is a parameter that is determined numerically, and the exponent mu = 2/3 [83].

VII. RELEVANCE TO EXPERIMENTS

A. Ultracold atomic gases

42

In Ref. [21], the experimental realization that was envisaged was a quantum quench in a dipolar

Fermi gas eﬀectively conﬁned to one dimension in a very anisotropic trap [96]. However, cooling

Fermi gases to temperatures well below the Fermi temperature, TF , is technically diﬃcult, although

some progress has been recently reported in the case of dipolar Fermi gases due to their long-ranged
interactions [71]. Currently, the lowest temperatures attainable are ≈ 10% of TF . Thus, even if
the dynamics of trapped ultracold gases can be studied for quite some time due to their isolated

nature making it extremely quantum coherent, ﬁnite temperature eﬀects must be accounted for

when comparing with the experiment. Such eﬀects were theoretically addressed in Ref. [25] for

the momentum distribution, with the conclusion that the latter is probably not the most ideal

observable to study quench dynamics. As argued in Ref. [25], the reason are the rather small

diﬀerences between the non-equilibrium steady state momentum distribution and the interacting

ﬁnite temperature momentum distribution may be hard to discern experimentally. Let us recall that

the, at ﬁnite temperatures, the discontinuity in momentum distribution is absent due to entropic

eﬀects. In addition, the discontinuity is also very sensitive to other eﬀects, such as inhomogeneity,

ﬁnite-size, etc. However, it is worth noticing that not all ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects are perverse.

Indeed, if the initial state is a ﬁnite temperate state ρ0 = e−H0/T , then the steady state is reached
much faster, t ≈ 1/T [21, 25], rather than for t → +∞.

Cooling problems are less severe for ultracold atomic gases of bosons, and therefore much more

progress has been made in studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. In fact, using

a trapped 1D cloud of bosons that suddenly is split longitudinally into two 1D clouds, it has been

possible to observe pre-thermalization [35, 36] and also ﬁnd strong evidence for relaxation to the

generalized Gibbs ensemble (in the pre-thermalized regime) [72]. As we have mentioned in the

previous section, to some extent, these experiments can be interpreted in terms of a quench in a
sine-Gordon model that is dual to the one in Eq. (111), i.e. with the replacement cos 2φ → cos θ [73–
75]. In the experiment, the ﬁeld θ corresponds to relative phase between the two atomic clouds and

the coupling g(t), which describes the Josephson tunneling between the two clouds, is suddenly

quenched from a large to a zero value. In other words, the quench proceeds from the gapped to the

gapless phase of the sine-Gordon model. Since the initial (Josephson) coupling g(t < 0) is large

due to the initial complete overlap of the two clouds, and the atoms in the 1D clouds are weakly

interacting, the harmonic approximation where cos θ ≈ −θ2/2 is a good starting point [35, 36, 73–
75]. Thus, the quench can be described by a quadratic model and a gaussian initial state, and it

is therefore expected to relax to the GGE, as we have discussed in section V. In the experiment,

the post-quench correlations of the (relative) phase are measured by letting the two atomic clouds

interfere after releasing them from the trap [35, 36, 72].

B. Mesoscopic systems

Despite being ultracold atomic gases a major motivation for the study of quantum quenches and

non-equilibrium dynamics, it may appear as somewhat striking to some that, some of the above

theoretical ideas have found faster applications in the realm of mesoscopic systems of electrons.

However, when subjected to intense magnetic ﬁelds and low temperatures, the “dirty” 2D gases

of interacting electrons in the quantum Hall regime have been for some time the arena for many

experiments that have reached the precision standards of atomic physics in interferometry[84], for

instance.

Chirality arising from the application of the magnetic ﬁeld makes the edges of the 2D electron

132QPC1QPC2NoiseGG2Vud11212Ln(✏)✏44

gas in the integer quantum Hall regime behave as clean, non-interacting, conducting channels

as far as the transport at small voltage bias is concerned. This is manifested in the perfect

conductance quantization of the latter in units of e2/h, which can be experimentally observed at

low temperatures. However, this does not mean that the (screened) Coulomb interaction can be

neglected. Coulomb interaction is indeed important to account for the spectral properties of the

channels. Furthermore, its eﬀect is especially felt when driving the system out of equilibrium. In

this regard, Kovrizhin and Chalker [85, 86] ﬁrst pointed out the interesting analogies between the

study of the relaxation mechanisms of integer quantum Hall interferometers and the interaction

quench in the LM. In this section, we shall closely follow the work of Milletar`ı and Rosenow [87],

which has also found recent experimental conﬁrmation [88].

Using a Hall bar device like the one shown in Fig. 6 at Landau-level ﬁlling ν = 2, it is possible

to prepare a double-step non-equilibrium distribution for the fermions in the outer edge channel

(denoted by 1 in Fig. 6). Mathematically,

n1R() = aθ(µ1 − ) + (1 − a)θ(µ2 − ),

(115)

where µ1 = (1 − a)eV and µ2 = −aeV (eV > 0), and 0 < a < 1. The initial state corresponding
to the above distribution is prepared by taking the outer channel 1, which comes from a reservoir

at chemical potential eV through the ﬁrst quantum point contact (QPC1). At this contact, the

channel is brought in close contact with its grounded left-moving partner at the other edge of the

Hall bar, which allows for local tunneling of electrons with diﬀerent chemical potentials between the

two. For non-interacting electrons, this results in the distribution function displayed in Eq. (115).

After being driven out of equilibrium, channel 1 is allowed to relax by interacting downstream with

the grounded inner channel 2 in the shaded region of Fig. 6. Chirality implies that time and space

play the same role and the spatial overlap of the two channels in this region can be regarded as

sudden quench of their mutual interaction. In the interaction region the channels are described by

the (‘post-quench’) Hamiltonian:

H =(cid:88)q>0(cid:16)a†1R(q) a†2R(q)(cid:17)

v1q

g4q/2

g4q/2

v2q 

a1R(q)

a2R(q) ,

(116)

which can be diagonalized by means of the canonical transformation a1R(q) = cos θ b1R(q) −
sin θ b2R(q) and a2R(q) = sin θ b1R(q) + cos θ b2R(q). The θ is the mixing angle, which is deter-
mined from tan 2θ = g4

, where g4 parametrizes the (screened Coulomb) interaction between

v1−v2

the two channels and v1 and v2 are the outer and inner channel velocities, respectively. Note that

mixing angle θ, which measures the strength of the inter-channel interaction. (b) Exponent γ1 of the excess
noise in the inner channel 2 which is ﬁtted acording to [a(1 − a)]γ1, where a is the transmission probability

numerical results obtained from the theory of Ref. [87]. The dashed line is a simple model proposed in

Ref. [88], for which F = (sin θ)/2. The shaded (blue) area represents the best ﬁt with the error of 1.2σ

based on the ﬁtted exponent γ1.

the appearance of trigonometric functions here (instead of the hyperbolic functions of the previous

sections) is due to the same (right-moving) chirality of the two coupled fermionic channels. Nev-

ertheless, as in the case of the LM, a solution of the quench dynamics can be obtained by means

of the following time-dependent canonical transformation:

a1R(q, t) = f1(q, t)a1R(q) + g(q, t)a2R(q),

a2R(q, t) = g(q, t)a1R(q) + f2(q, t)a2R(q),

(cf. Fig. 6). The shot noise in this channel is thus measured at contact number 3 (cf. 6). Roughly

speaking, shot noise measures the (fractional) charge of the carriers and can be obtained from the

single-particle Green’s function of the channel (α = R, L):

gaussianity of the initial state, which yields the double-step distribution of Eq. (115). However,

it can be still expressed in terms of a Fredholm determinant of the Toeplitz type and evaluated
numerically [87]. The properties of the steady state are accessed by taking the limit t → +∞ in
the above Green’s function. The resulting steady state is not thermal [87], which is a consequence

of the constrained dynamics of the model. The shot noise can be then extracted from the steady

state Green’s function. The so-called Fano factor, corresponding to the ratio F = S/Sref where
Sref = 4epa(1− a)(e2/h)V (p = |t2|2˜vsin2 θ

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Having the opportunity to write this article has taught us that the subject of quantum quenches

in the Luttinger and related models continues to enjoy tremendous vitality after ten years. There

47

are plenty of new analytical results, often obtained by the combination of powerful techniques

which include conformal ﬁeld theory, Bethe-ansatz, non-equilibrium (Keldysh) Green’s functions,

etc. In addition, powerful numerical methods have been applied to various models and are teaching

us where the analytics can be (and cannot be) applied.

Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the universality of the LM predictions, beyond the

rather fragmented knowledge obtained from speciﬁc models, is still lacking. In the authors’ view,

such a framework still needs to be put in place. This framework should relate to some of the

concepts of entanglement that have been surveyed in section V and should be able to account for

the diﬀerences between gaussian and non-gaussian initial states. More importantly, the theoretical

framework should also provide quantitative answers to questions about time scales and requirements

for thermalization. It should tell which perturbations to the Hamiltonian of an exactly solvable

model like Luttinger’s are dominant in driving the system towards thermal equilibrium, which ones

subdominant, and what the time scales associated with them are.

On the experimental side, results are coming out at an increased pace. These include the recent

observation of relaxation to the generalized Gibbs ensemble in an ultracold gas [72]. However, as

theorists who cherish their own (theoretical) pets, we would like to see similar experiments carried

out for a more faithful (fermionic) realization of the interaction quench in the Luttinger model. Our

hope is that this article may motivate a young experimentalist to take on this challenge. In addition,

let us mention that using diﬀerent probes in the mesoscopic setup discussed in section VII B may

allow for a more thorough characterization of the non-equilibrium steady state, and whether it is

really a steady state or just a pre-thermalized one. Ultracold atomic systems still have a lot of

oﬀer as well as trapped ions [80] since possibilities for the control of the system parameters and

the preparation of the initial state are larger for these systems.

There are also new venues waiting to be fully explored. There is a zoo of newly discovered

topologically-protected phases out there. Many of them are endowed with gapless states at their

interfaces with topologically trivial matter. In two dimensions, some of these gapless states can be

described as Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, and the ideas described in section VII B can be relevant

for the understanding of their non-equilibrium dynamics as well. From a broader perspective, we

may also wonder what kind of new manifestations in the non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting

system topological protection can bring in.

Going beyond isolated systems (or systems that can be treated to a large extent as such), the

dynamics of the Luttiger model and its relatives coupled to environments is, to the best of our

knowledge, a largely uncharted territory. The study of mesoscopic systems is clearly an area that

48

can beneﬁt from such studies since, in the solid state, it is much more diﬃcult to completely

isolate fragile quantum systems from their environment. Accounting for the eﬀects of realistic

sources of quantum dissipation [78] is therefore an interesting research direction. Furthermore, in

ultracold atomic systems, despite being largely isolated, it is also possible to engineer interesting

environments [89] and the study of quantum dynamics in those setups should be a promising

research topic.

[90] Keldysh aﬁcionados are referred to e.g. Refs. [22, 69], where the same solution is obtained using the

non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism.

[91] For the Bethe-ansatz solvable XXZ, analytical expressions are known for v and K at half-ﬁlling [17,

18, 31]. For ∆2 (cid:54)= 0, these parameters were obtained numerically by Karrasch et al. [32].

[92] The number of patches, N , must be taken to be large but ﬁnite, in order to keep under control the

divergences in the Cooper channel leading to the Kohn-Luttinger instabilities [29].

[93] Indeed, the description is eﬀective at the level of correlation functions. However, it has been pointed

out [25, 41] that the GGE does not contain all the necessary correlations between the eigenmodes to

reproduce other quantities such as the energy ﬂuctuations. In fact, there are situations for which the

GGE essentially looks like a thermal density matrix [41, 58] and therefore it appears as if the system

exhibits thermal correlations. However, the diﬀerence with a real thermal state is exhibited by the

failure of the system in the steady state to obey the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem for the energy

ﬂuctuations [41].

[94] Eq. (88) can be proven by expanding in series the exponential in the left-hand side in a Taylor series

and applying Wick’s theorem to all the terms, which involve powers of A(x1, . . . , xn). Resuming the

resulting series, the right hand-side of Eq. (88) is obtained

[95] Of course, this assumes the validity of some kind of quasi-particle picture, as it is the case of the

Luttinger model, but may not be case of other critical models.

[96] Note that, unlike for sthe Coulomb potential, the Fourier transform of the dipolar potential is regular

in one dimension.
