Abstract

Absolutely maximally entangled, AME, states are pure multipartite
states that, when half or more of the sites are traced out, the maximum
entropy mixed state is obtained. AME states have been studied in a num-
ber of papers and found applications in ﬁelds like teleportation or quantum
secret sharing, and provide links between diﬀerent areas of mathematics,
like coding theory, orthogonal arrays, quantum error correcting codes,
combinatorial designs or multiunitary matrices.

In this paper, the existence of absolutely maximally entangled states
of minimal support is found for certain values of the number of sites and
of the local dimension. A negative result is also proved, that shows that
a known necessary condition for the existence of those AME states is not
suﬃcient

1 Introduction

Absolutely maximally entangled states
where ﬁrst considered in [6]
in the
context of quantum error correcting
codes, where they where called “(cid:4)n/2(cid:5)-
uniform”, and in [3]
in the context
of quantum secret sharing schemes,
where the term “absolutely maximally
entangled, AME” state was ﬁrst used.
AME states have found applications
in ﬁelds like teleportation or quantum
secret sharing, and provide links be-

tween diﬀerent areas of mathematics,
like coding theory, orthogonal arrays,
quantum error correcting codes, com-
binatorial designs or multiunitary ma-
trices, see [1], [3] and [4].

This paper deals with the problem
of existence of AM E states that are
supported in a minimal set of kets from
the computational bases. We prove
that those states exist for a number of
sites n ≥ 4 and a prime power local
dimension d ≥ n − 1. It is also proved
that no AME states of minimal sup-

1

port exist with n = 7 and d = 5.

In section 2, we give the deﬁnition
of a general AM E state and a charac-
terization to ﬁx the notation. In sec-
tion 3, we give the deﬁnition of AM E
states of minimal support and review
several of their properties that will be
used in the paper.
In section 4, we
apply the theory of linear MDS codes
over ﬁnite ﬁelds in order to prove the
existence results of the paper. Finally,
section 5 summarizes our results and
states some open questions.

states

max-
entangled

General AM E states have been stud-
ied in a number of papers, we just
recall brieﬂy the main deﬁnition and
characterization for its later use in the
paper.

Deﬁnition 1. Let n and d be integers
n, d ≥ 2. Let |Ψi be a pure multipartite
state in n sites, where the local Hilbert
space is d-dimensional. That is,

|Ψi ∈ (Cd)⊗n.

We say that |Ψi is absolutely max-
imally entangled with n sites and lo-
cal dimension d, AM E(n, d), if for any
partition of {1, . . . , n} into two disjoint
subsets A and B, with |B| = m ≤
|A| = n − m, the density obtained from
|ΨihΨ| tracing out the sites on the en-
tries in A is multiple of the identity,

TrA |ΨihΨ| =

1
dm IdC⊗m .

Thus, the state |Ψi is an AME state
if, whenever we ignore the state on half

or more of the sites, we get a multi-
ple of the identity matrix, the state of
maximum confusion.

We refer the reader to [1] and to the
references given there, for a wide discu-
sion of the properties of AM E states.
It is an open problem to ﬁnd exactly
for what values n and d do AM E(n, d)
states exist. In [1] and its references,
examples can be found on the positive,
e.g. AM E(6, 2) states exist, and on
the negative, e.g. AM E(4, 2) states do
not exist.

We cite the following characteriza-

tion [3]:

Theorem 1. Let n and d be integers,
n, d ≥ 2. A pure state |Ψi ∈ (C)⊗n is
an AM E(n, d)-state if, and only if, for
any partition

{1, . . . , n} = A ∪ B,

with |B| = m ≤ |A|, there is, for any
vector ~k = {ki}i∈B, 0 ≤ ki ≤ d − 1, a
ket |φ(~k)i in the tensor product of the
local spaces in the sites signaled by the
set A, so that |φ(~k)i is an orthonormal
system and

|Ψi = d− m

3 AME states of mini-

mal support

3.1 First properties

If V is a vector space v ∈ V and B ⊂ V
is a basis of V , the support of v in the
basis B is the number of nonzero coor-
dinates of v in the basis B.

We have a lower bound for the sup-
port of any AME state on the com-
putational basis |s1, . . . , sni, 0 ≤ si ≤
d − 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

2

Proposition 1. If n and d are in-
tegers, n, d ≥ 2 and |Ψi
is an
AM E(n, d) state, then the support of
|Ψi with respect to the computational
basis is at least dm, where m = (cid:4) n
Proof. The proof is a simple linear al-
gebra argument, that follows from a
representation of the state,
like (1),
where B = {1, . . . , m}, A = {m +
1, . . . , n}, observing that the support
of |Ψi is, at least, the number of vec-
tors ~k in the expansion.

2 (cid:5).

Deﬁnition 2. Given two integers n,
d, with n, d ≥ 2, we will say that
an AM E(n, d) state |Ψi is of mini-
mal support if the support of |Ψi in the
computational basis is d⌊n/2⌋.

This minimal support is not always
attained. For example, despite that
there are AM E(6, 2) states, there is no
such a state with minimal support, as
we will comment later.

An AM E(n, d) state of minimal

support has the form

|Ψi =

dm

X

ν=1

βν|kν,1, . . . , kν,ni,

(2)

where βk are,
in principle, complex
coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcients βk must
have equal modulus, this can be seen
working with the expansion (1), and
observing that, in our case, the terms
|φ(~k)i there must be kets from the
computational basis, over the sites of
A.

it

Then,

follows

that all

the
AM E(n, d) states of minimal sup-
port can be expressed as
|Ψi =
P2m−1
e iθν |kν,1, . . . , kν,ni, for a cer-
tain set of 2m n-tuples (kν,1, . . . , kν,n).
It can be easily checked that if an state

ν=0

|Ψi is AM E(n, d) with minimal sup-
port for a trial of the phases θν, the
state obtainded from |Ψi changing the
phases θν for another set of phases θ′
ν
is also AM E(n, d) of minimal support.
Thus, when it comes to determine
whether AM E(n, d) of minimal sup-
port exist, the phases play no role and
only the set of tuples (kν,1, . . . , kν,n)
matters.

3.2 Some

properties

of
AME states of minimal
support

There are many characterizations and
properties of AME states, see [1] and
the references given there. We include
here two characterizations that will be
useful later.

the

We

consider

set Zd =
{0, . . . , d − 1}. A code over the al-
phabet Zd of wordlength n is a sub-
set C ⊂ Zn
d . On C we consider the
Hamming distance. Given two words
w, w′ ∈ C, the Hamming distance be-
tween w and w′, DH (w, w′) is the num-
ber of coordinates on which the words
w and w′ diﬀer. The minimum dis-
tance δ of the code C is the minimum
of the distances DH (w, w′) between
diﬀerent words w, w′ ∈ C. The well
known Singleton bound establishes
that |C| ≤ dn−δ+1. A code is called
maximum distance separable, MDS, if
the singleton bound is an equality. See
[7] for general properties of codes.

The existence of AM E(n, d) of
minimal support is equivalent to the
existence of MDS codes of wordlength
n, alphabet size d and minimum dis-
tance ⌈n/2⌉ + 1. The proof of this fact
can be found in [1] and [4]. The words
of the code and the kets of the state
are in one onto one correspondence.

3

We can organize the kets of the
state |Ψi as in (2) in a table T with
n columns and d⌊n/2⌋ rows. The state
|Ψi is AM E(n, d) of minimal support
if, and only if, whenever we select
(cid:4)n/2(cid:5) columns from T , the rows of the
(cid:4)n/2(cid:5)×d⌊n/2⌋ subtable so obtained are
⌊n/2⌋
. See [1] or [7] for a proof.
all Z
d
A table with this property is called an
orthogonal array of index 1. In this pa-
per, we will call it just an orthogonal
array.

From here, it is easy to prove the
following property, see also [1] for more
details:

Proposition 2. Let n ≥ 3 be an in-
teger. If there is an AM E(n, d) state
of minimal support, then there is an
AM E(n − 1, d) state of minimal sup-
port.

Proof. We take the orthogonal array T
associated to an AM E(n, d) state of
minimal support. Then we delete one
column of that table.

The subtable so obtained, T ′, has
n − 1 columns and d⌊n/2⌋ rows. If n is
odd, (cid:4)n/2(cid:5) = (cid:4)(n − 1)/2(cid:5) and T ′ is an
orthogonal array. If n is even, we keep
from the T ′ those rows that had a zero
entry deleted when creating T ′ from T .
The new table T ′′ has n − 1 columns
and d⌊(n−1)/2⌋ rows and it also is an
orthogonal array.

So, given d, the set of all n such
that and AM E(n, d) of minimal sup-
port exists is an interval.

Corollary 1. For any integer d ≥ 2,
there is an integer N (d) such that, an
AM E(n, d) state of minimal support
exists if, and only if, n ≤ N (d).

The following is a necessary condi-
tion for the existence of AM E states

4

of minimal support, [1]:

Theorem 2. If n ≥ 4 and an
AM E(n, d) state of minimal support
exists, then d ≥ ⌈ n

2 ⌉ + 1.

This condition forbids many combi-
nations (n, d) for an AM E(n, d) state
of minimal support to exist. For ex-
ample, despite the fact that there are
AM E(6, 2) states, as commented on
section 3.2, no such a state can be min-
imally supported.

As a result of theorem 2, we get an
upper bound for the maximum number
of sites available N (d).

Corollary 2. For any integer d ≥ 3,
N (d) ≤ 2d − 2, if N (d) is even, and
N (d) ≤ 2d − 3, if N (d) is odd.
Proof. We observe that theorem 2 is
true when d ≥ 3, for any n ≥ 2, the
cases not covered in theorem 2 being
trivial. Since AM E(N (d), d) states of
minimal support exist, the statement
is another way to write the inequality
⌈N (d)/2⌉ + 1 ≤ d.

All

the

the properties and charac-
terizations about
existence of
AM E(n, d) states of minimal support
discused so far are of combinatorial na-
ture, and are true for any integer local
dimension d.

4 Concerning
MDS codes

linear

In the case where d is a prime power,
the alphabet {0, . . . , d−1} can be given
a unique ﬁeld structure, GF (d). In this
case, there is more detailed informa-
tion on certain cases, that gives more
examples of AM E(n, d) states of min-
imal support.
We will

talk

where n stands for the code lenght and
k is the code dimension. If the code is
MDS, the Singleton identity reads

k = n − δ + 1,

where δ is the minimum distance. The
linear MDS codes that give rise to
AM E(n, d) states of minimal support
have dimension k = n−⌈n/2⌉ = (cid:4)n/2(cid:5).
The following result will give us
many examples of AM E states of min-
imal support.

Theorem 3. (a) There are AM E(n, d)

states of minimal support, when-
ever n ≥ 4 and d ≥ n − 1 is a
power of a prime number.

(b) There are AM E(n = 6, d = 4)

states of minimal support.

Proof. The proof uses the fact that the
existence of AM E(n, d) states of min-
imal support is equivalent to the exis-
tence of M DS codes of length n and
minimum distance ⌈n/2⌉ + 1, as stated
in section 3.2.

When d is the power of a prime,
we have the theory of generalized Red
Solomon, GRS, codes and their exten-
sions, that are known to be MDS, so we
resort to known facts about this theory.
For example, see table 11.1 on [7] for
the known facts on MDS codes men-
tioned in this proof.

For the proof of (a), it is known
that, if 4 ≤ n ≤ d+1 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n−2,
there is linear MDS code of lenght n
and dimension k over GF (d), a dou-
bly extended GRS code.
If we set
k = (cid:4)n/2(cid:5), the required inequality for
k, 2 ≤ (cid:4)n/2(cid:5) ≤ n − 2, is true, for any
n ≥ 4.

For the proof of (b), it is also known
that, if 5 ≤ n ≤ d + 2, k = n − 3, and
d is a power of 2, then there is a linear

5

MDS code over GF (d) of wordlength
n and dimension k, a triply extended
GRS code. To get a result not already
contained in (a), we set n = 6 and
d = 4.

We observe that part (b) of theo-
rem 3 has already been established in
[1] using another approach.

Corollary 3. If d is a prime power,
d ≥ 3, then N (d) ≥ d + 1.

Proof. Apply theorem 3 (a) to n =
d + 1.
It follows that there is an
AM E(d + 1, d) state of minimal sup-
port and the inequality follows.

We end with a negative result, that
saturates the inequality of theorem 2.
Hence, the necessary condition given in
theorem 2 is not suﬃcient.

Theorem 4. There is no AM E(7, 5)
state of minimal support.

Proof. As in [7], deﬁne Ld(k) as the
maximum wordlength of any linear
MDS code of dimension k over GF (d),
d being a prime power. Several bounds
an equalities are known about Ld(k),
see [7]. We will use that Ld(3) = d + 1
if d is an odd prime power. In partic-
ular, we use that L5(3) = 6.

This

shows

that

no

Now suppose that an AM E(7, 5)
state of minimal support exists. There
is then an MDS code over GF (5) with
wordlength 7 and minimum distance
⌈7/2⌉ + 1 = 5. The code given in [1]
however, is not guaranteed to be linear.
To end the proof, we note a result of
[5], that any MDS code, not necessarily
linear, over an alphabet of size 5, code
size 5k, k ≥ 3, and minimum distance
δ ≥ 3, can be transformed to a linear

MDS code with the same parameters
and dimension k with a permutation
of coordinates, followed by a permuta-
tion of the symbols at each coordinate
separately.

We observe that, as a consequence
of the last theorem and of proposition
2, there are no AM E(n, 5) states of
minimal support, for n ≥ 7.
In par-
ticular, we see there is no AM E(8, 5)
state of minimal support, answering
negatively an open question stated in
[1], at least in the minimally supported
case.

5 Conclusions

The existence problem for AM E(n, d)
states is a non trivial one, even for
states minimally supported.

To the necessary condition, that
d ≥ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1, valid for general n ≥ 4
and any d, a suﬃcient one d ≥ n − 1
is given, valid for n ≥ 4 and d a
prime power. The nonexistence of
AM E(7, 5) states of minimal support,
implies that the necessary condition is
not suﬃcient.

Those inequalities can be read in
terms of the maximum number of sites
N (d) that allow for AM E states of
minimal support for a given local di-
mension d:

d + 1 ≤ N (d) ≤ 2d − 2, or 2d − 3,

being the inequality on the right valid
for any integer d ≥ 3 and the one in
the left valid for all d ≥ 3 power of a
prime number. We have seen that the
upper bound for N (d) is not tight.

There remains a lot of work to do.
Linear coding theory is restricted to
the case where the local dimension is

a prime power. To investigate other
local dimensions, further consideration
of general coding theory and of combi-
natorial structures, like orthogonal ar-
rays, seems needed. Sharper estimates
on the maximum number of sites N (d)
that allow for AM E states of minimal
support for a given local dimension are
desirable too.
