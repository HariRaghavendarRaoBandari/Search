ALMOST GENTLE ALGEBRAS AND THEIR TRIVIAL

EXTENSIONS

EDWARD L. GREEN AND SIBYLLE SCHROLL

Abstract. In this paper we deﬁne almost gentle algebras. They are monomial spe-
cial multiserial algebras generalizing gentle algebras. We show that the trivial exten-
sion of an almost gentle algebra by its minimal injective co-generator is a symmetric
special multiserial algebra and hence a Brauer conﬁguration algebra. Conversely,
we show that admissible cuts of Brauer conﬁguration algebras give rise to gentle
algebras and as a consequence, we obtain that every Brauer conﬁguration algebra
with multiplicity function identically one, is the trivial extension of an almost gentle
algebra.

1. Introduction

In this paper we introduce a new class of multiserial algebras called almost gentle alge-
bras. These algebras are monomial quadratic algebras which generalise gentle algebras.
Namely, an algebra KQ/I is almost gentle if it is special multiserial and if I is generated
by paths of length 2. It is clear from the deﬁnition that every gentle algebra is almost
gentle. While gentle algebras are of tame representation type, almost gentle algebras
are wild in general. However, there are many examples of almost gentle algebras of
ﬁnite and tame representation type that are not gentle.

Gentle algebras are one of the classes of most studied algebras as their representation
theory is underpinned by a strong combinatorial structure. They are string algebras
and as such their indecomposable modules are given by string and band modules, and
their Auslander-Reiten quiver is completly determined by the string combinatorics [BR].
Maps between string and band modules have been given in [CB] and [Kr], respectively.
It is a class of algebras closed under derived equivalence [SZ] and the indecomposable
objects in the derived category of a gentle algebra have been determined in [BM], they
are given by homotopy strings and bands. In [ALP] the maps between homotopy strings
and bands have been explicitly described. The singularity category of a gentle algebra
has been described in [Ka]. Furthermore, recently there has been a renewed interest in
gentle algebras, as they appear as Jacobian algebras associated to triangulations (resp.
partial triangulations) of marked surfaces where all marked points lie in the boundary
[ABCP] (resp. [SR]).

Almost gentle algebras do not have the underlying string combinatorics that gentle al-
gebras have. However, the strong similarity in their structure makes this an interesting
new class of algebras to consider. It contains many examples of well-studied algebras,

such as hereditary algebras arising from many orientations of all Dynkin and extended
Dynkin quivers.

Just as gentle algebras, almost gentle algebras can be of ﬁnite or inﬁnite global di-
mension. They are of inﬁnite global dimension if and only if the quiver contains an
oriented cycle in which every subpaths of lengths two is in I. While gentle algebras are
Gorenstein [GR], this is not necessarily true for almost gentle algebras, see the example
in Section 2.

A characterisation of gentle algebras is through the trivial extension by their minimal
injective co-generator. That is, an algebra A is gentle if and only if the trivial extension
T (A) = A ⋉ Homk(A, k) is special biserial [PS], see also [R]. In this paper we show that
the trivial extension of an almost gentle algebra is special multiserial. Examples of triv-
ial extensions of almost gentle algebras appear, for example, in the derived equivalence
classiﬁcation of symmetric algebras of ﬁnite and tame representation type, see[Sk] and
the references within. These almost gentle algebras are given by a certain orientation
of a Dynkin quiver of type A, D, E, and ˜A, ˜E, ˜D, respectively.

Another class of examples of algebras arising as trivial extensions of almost gentle alge-
bras is given by symmetric algebras with radical cubed zero which have been extensively
studied, see for example [B, ESch, ESo] and [GS2]. It follows from the results in this
paper and in [GS2] that an algebra is a symmetric algebra with radical cubed zero if
and only if it is a trivial extension of an almost gentle algebra where the paths in the
quiver of the almost gentle algebra are all of length at most one.

Finally, we show that an admissible cut, as deﬁned in [S], and based on the deﬁnition
of admissible cuts in [F] and [FP] (see Section 5 for the deﬁnition), of a symmetric
special biserial algebra gives rise to an almost gentle algebra. In the other direction we
show that every symmetric special multiserial algebra with no powers in the relations
or equivalently that every Brauer conﬁguration algebra with multiplicity function equal
to one is the trivial extension of an almost gentle algebra (see [GS1] for the deﬁnition
of Brauer conﬁguration algebras). We note that this almost gentle algebra is not
unique. In fact, our construction gives a whole family of almost gentle algebras that
have isomorphic trivial extensions. While all of these gentle algebras have the same
number of simple modules, they can have very diﬀerent homological properties. For
example, some might have ﬁnite global dimension while others might have inﬁnite global
dimension. Furthermore, it is straightforward to see that these algebras are not derived
equivalent in general. We leave it as an open question to the reader to determine the
relationship between all the gentle algebras that have the same trivial extension.

2. Almost gentle algebras

In this section we deﬁne almost gentle algebras, generalizing the class of gentle algebras.

First we ﬁx some notation. Let K be a ﬁeld. All algebras are assumed to be indecom-
posable K-algebras. Unless otherwise stated, an algebra given by quiver and relations,
KQ/I is assumed to be ﬁnite dimensional and the ideal I is assumed to be admissible.
For a quiver Q, we denote by Q0 the set of vertices in Q and by Q1, the set of arrows
in Q. We set ev to be the trivial path at a vertex v ∈ Q0. Furthermore, for a, b ∈ Q1,
we write ab for the path a followed by b. We let s(a) be the vertex at which the arrow
a starts and let t(a) be the vertex at which a ends. For a path p = a1...an in Q, we set
s(p) = s(a1) and t(p) = t(an). Given a ﬁnite dimensional algebra Λ, let Λe ≃ Λ ⊗k Λop.

Recall from [GS2] that an algebra is special multiserial if it is Morita equivalent to an
algebra KQ/I satisfying the condition that for every arrow a in Q1, there exists at
most one arrow b and at most one arrow c in Q1 such that ab is not in I and ca is not
in I.

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that an algebra is almost gentle if it is Morita equivalent to a
special multiserial algebra KQ/I where I is generated by monomial relations of length
two.

If an almost gentle algebra KQ/I is such that every vertex of Q is the starting point
of at most two arrows and every vertex is the target of at most two arrows then KQ/I
is gentle.

We state some basic facts about almost gentle algebras. An almost gentle algebra KQ/I
is of inﬁnite global dimension if there is an oriented cycle in Q such that every path of
length two in that cycle is in I. If no such cycle exists then KQ/I is of ﬁnite global
dimension. Since the ideal I can be generated by paths of length 2, every almost gentle
algebra is a Koszul algebra. The only almost gentle algebras that are self-injective are
K[x]/(x2) and the oriented cycle with all paths of length 2 being relations.

Gentle algebras are Gorenstein [GR]. The same does not hold for almost gentle algebra.

In the following lemmas we collect some obvious properties of almost gentle algebras.

oriented cycle path in I Lemma 2.2. Let A = KQ/I be an almost gentle algebra and let C be an oriented cycle

in Q. Then there exists a path of length two in C that is in I.

Let p be a path in Q. Then we say that p is a maximal path of A = KQ/I if p /∈ I
and, for every arrow a in Q we have ap ∈ I and pa ∈ I. We denote the set of maximal
paths of A by M.

Then v lies in a unique maximal path of A if and only if one of the following conditions
holds

(i) v is a sink with a unique arrow ending at v,

(ii) v is a source with a unique arrow starting at v,

(iii) there is a unique arrow a ending at v and there is a unique arrow b starting at v
and ab /∈ I.

GREEN AND SCHROLL

We introduce two functions associated to an almost gentle algebra A which will be
used later in the paper. Let ⋄ be some element not in Q1 and set A = Q1 ∪ {⋄}.

Deﬁne σ : Q1 → A and τ : Q1 → A by σ(a) = (b
τ (a) = (c

if ca /∈ I
if ca /∈ I for all c ∈ Q1

⋄

if ab /∈ I
if ab ∈ I for all b ∈ Q1

and

⋄

where a, b, c ∈ Q1. From the deﬁnitioin of spe-

cial multiserial, we see that these functions are well-deﬁned. Since A is ﬁnite dimen-
sional, for every a ∈ Q1, there are smallest nonnegative integers Ma and Na such
that σMa(a) = ⋄ and τ Na(a) = ⋄. It follows that the unique maximal path of A con-
taining the arrow a is τ Na−1(a)τ Na−2(a) · · · τ (a)aσ(a) · · · σMa−1(a), which is of length
Ma + Na − 1. Since a maximal path of A has no repeated arrows and since every arrow
is in a unique maximal path of A, it is easy to see that a maximal path of A is the
unique maximal path of A of any of its arrows and the position at which that arrow
occurs in the path is uniquely determined.

If A = KQ/I and π : KQ → A is the canonical surjection, then for x ∈ KQ we will
denote π(x) by ¯x. If a ∈ Q1, we let Ua be the right A-module aA generated by a. If A
is an almost gentle algebra, then the Ua are uniserial A-modules. Note that this holds
more generally if A is a special multiserial algebra, see [GS2].

radical-structure Proposition 2.5. Let A = KQ/I be an almost gentle algebra. Then rad(A) =La∈Q1 Ua.

A K-basis for A is the set of ¯p, where ¯p is a subpath of length ≥ 1 of a maximal path
of A, together with the trivial subpaths ev, for v ∈ Q0.

Proof. Since A is a monomial algebra, A has a K-basis {¯p | p is a path in Q and p /∈ I}.
Any such p either has length ≥ 1 or p = ev for some vertex v. This proves the basis
part of the result. If p = a1 · · · an is a path in Q then ¯p ∈ Ua1. It also follows that

Pa∈Q1 Ua = rad(A) since the image of the arrows generate rad(A). Using that A is a
monomial algebra, we see La∈Q1 Ua = rad(A).

If p is a path in Q, we let ℓ(p) denote the length of p.

3. The symmetric special multiserial algebra associated to an almost

gentle algebra

In [GS3] given a special multiserial algebra A, we constructed a symmetric special mul-
tiserial algebra A∗ such that A is a quotient of A∗. We slightly modify that construction
below in the case of an almost gentle algebra. In this section, A = KQ/I will denote
an almost gentle algebra where I is an ideal generated by quadratic elements. Recall
that M is the set of maximal paths of A.

We begin by deﬁning a new quiver Q∗. The vertices of Q∗ are the same as Q. For each
m ∈ M, let am denote an arrow (not in Q1) from the end vertex of m to the start vertex

ALMOST GENTLE ALGEBRAS AND TRIVIAL EXTENSIONS

5

of m. The arrow set of Q∗ is Q1 ∪ {am | m ∈ M}. Since Q is a subquiver of Q∗, we
freely view paths in Q as paths in Q∗. For each m ∈ M, we obtain a cycle Cm = mam
in Q∗. We let S denote the set cycles C ∗ such that C ∗ is a cyclic permutation of Cm
for some m ∈ M. Let µ : S → Z>0 be deﬁned by µ(C ∗) = 1, for all C ∗ ∈ S.
We say a cycle in Q∗ is simple if the cycle has no repeated arrows. Following [GS3]
we say a pair (T , ν) is a deﬁning pair in Q if T is a set of simple cycles in Q and
ν : T → Z>0 which satisfy the following conditions:

D0 If C is a loop at a vertex v and C ∈ T , then ν(C) > 1.

D1 If a simple cycle is in T , every cyclic permutation of the cycle is in T .

D2 If C ∈ T and C ′ is a cyclic permutation of C then ν(C) = ν(C ′).

D3 Every arrow occurs in some simple cycle in T .

D4 If an arrow occurs in two cycles in T , the cycles are cyclic permutations of each

other.

defining pair Proposition 3.1. The pair (S, µ) deﬁned above is a deﬁning pair.

Proof. Since for m ∈ M, m has no repeated arrows, the cycles mam and their cyclic
permutations are simple cycles. If a is a loop in Q, and hence in Q∗, then since A is
ﬁnite dimensional and I can be generated by paths of length 2, we see that a2 ∈ I. Let
m be the unique maximal path in which a occurs. Then a occurs in mam which is not a
loop. That is, S contains no loops and hence D0 vacuously holds. By construction D1
holds. Since µ ≡ 1, D2 holds. Since every arrow in Q occurs in some maximal path m,
every arrow in Q occurs in some cycle C ∗ ∈ S. Each new arrow am occurs in mam ∈ S
and we see that D3 holds. Since an arrow in Q occurs in a unique maximal path in Q,
D4 holds.

(cid:3)

Following [GS3], if (S, µ) is a deﬁning pair in Q∗ then the K-algebra they deﬁne has
quiver Q∗ and ideal of relations generated by all relations of the following three types:
Type 1 C µ(C) − C ′µ(C ′), if C and C ′ are cycles in S at some vertex v ∈ Q0.
Type 2 Ca, if C ∈ S and a is the ﬁrst arrow in C.

Type 3 ab, if a, b ∈ Q1 and ab does not lay on any C ∈ S.

The algebra A∗ = KQ∗/I ∗, where I ∗ is generated by all relations of Types 1, 2, and 3,
is called the algebra deﬁned by (S, µ). By [GS3], A∗ is a symmetric special multiserial
algebra which we call the symmetric special multiserial algebra associated to A.

The next result determines the dimension of A∗.

dim of A* Proposition 3.2. Let A be an almost gentle algebra and let A∗ be the symmetric special

multiserial algebra associated to A. Then

dimK(A∗) = 2|Q0| + Xm∈M

In particular, dimK (A∗) = 2 dimK (A).

ℓ(m) · (ℓ(m) + 1).

GREEN AND SCHROLL

Proof. The quiver of Q∗ of A∗ has |Q0| vertices, and so there are |Q0| paths of length 0,
the ev, for v ∈ Q0. Since A∗ is a symmetric algebra, the socle of A∗ has dimension |Q0|.
We now ﬁnd the dimension of rad(A∗)/ soc(A∗). Consider m ∈ M. The cycle mam ∈ S
has length ℓ(m) + 1. If a is an arrow in mam then aA∗ is a uniserial module of length
ℓ(m) + 1. Then aA∗/(aA∗ ∩ soc(A∗) has dimension ℓ(m) and there are ℓ(m) + 1 choices

for a. Therefore, we see that dimK(rad(A∗)/ soc(A∗)) =Pm∈M ℓ(m)(ℓ(m) + 1).

The last part follows from Corollary 2.6.

(cid:3)

4. Trivial extension of an almost gentle algebra

Let A = KQ/I be a ﬁnite dimensional algebras and let D(A) = HomK(A, K) be its K-
linear dual. Recall that the trivial extension T (A) = A ⋊ D(A) is a symmetric algebra
deﬁned as the vector space A ⊕ D(A) and with multiplication given by (a, f )(b, g) =
(ab, ag + f b), for any a, b ∈ A and f, g ∈ D(A). Note that D(A) is an A-A-bimodule
via the following. If a, b ∈ A and f ∈ D(A), then af b : A → K by (af b)(x) = f (bxa).
We keep the convention that if x ∈ KQ, and π : KQ → A is the canonical surjection,
then we denote π(x) by ¯x.

Let B be the set of ﬁnite directed paths in Q and suppose that I is generated by paths;
that is, KQ/I is a monomial algebra. Consider the set ¯B = {p ∈ B | p /∈ I}. The set
{¯p | p ∈ ¯B} is a K-basis of A. We abuse notation and view ¯B as a K-basis of A. Then
the set M of maximal paths of A is a subset of ¯B and forms a K-basis of socAe(A)
consisting of uniform elements.
The dual basis, ¯B∨ = {p∨ | p ∈ ¯B} is a K-basis of D(A) where, if p ∈ ¯B, p∨ ∈ D(A)
is the element in D(A) deﬁned by p∨(q) = δp,q for q ∈ ¯B, where δp,q is the Kronecker
delta.

basic properties of T(A) Lemma 4.1. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional monomial algebra with K-basis ¯B as above.

Then, for p, q, r ∈ ¯B, the following hold in T (A).

(1) (p, 0)(0, r∨) =((0, s∨),
(2) (0, r∨)(q, 0) =((0, s∨),

0,

0,

if there is some s ∈ ¯B with sp = r
otherwise.

if there is some s ∈ ¯B with qs = r
otherwise.

(3) (0, p∨)(q, 0)(0, r∨) = 0.
(4) If prq ∈ ¯B for some p, q, r ∈ ¯B then (q, 0)(0, (prq)∨)(p, 0) = (0, r∨).

Proof. Parts (1) and (2) are an immediate consequence of the multiplication in T (A).
Part (3) follows from parts (1) and (2) and that (0, x∨)(0, y∨) = 0, for all x, y ∈ ¯B.
Part (4) follows from parts (1) and (2).

(cid:3)

generating T(A) Proposition 4.2. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional monomial algebra with K-basis ¯B as

above. Then T (A) can be generated by {(a, 0) | a ∈ Q1} ∪ {(0, m∨) | m ∈ M}.

ALMOST GENTLE ALGEBRAS AND TRIVIAL EXTENSIONS

Proof. Since {(p, 0) | p ∈ ¯B} ∪ {(0, p∨) | p ∈ ¯B} is a K-basis, we need only show
that if p ∈ ¯B, then (p, 0) and (0, p∨) is in the two sided ideal J in T (A) generated by
{(a, 0) | a ∈ Q1}∪{(0, m∨) | m ∈ M}. Let p ∈ ¯B. Since p is a product of arrows, (p, 0) is
a product of elements of the form (a, 0) where a is an arrow in Q. Now consider (0, p∨).
There are paths r and s such that rps ∈ M. But then (0, p∨) = (s, 0)(0, (rps)∨)(r, 0)
by Lemma 4.1 part (4) and we are done.
(cid:3)

We now prove the main result of this section.

A* iso to T(A) Theorem 4.3. Let A = KQ/I be an almost gentle algebra, A∗ be the symmetric special
multiserial algebra associated to A, and T (A) be the trivial extension of A by D(A).
Then A∗ is isomorphic to T (A).

Proof. Let Q∗ be the quiver of A∗ which is deﬁned in Section 3. We begin by deﬁning
a ring surjection ϕ from KQ∗ to T (A). Since the vertices of Q∗ are the same as the
vertices in Q and since Q is a subquiver of QT , the quiver of T (A), we send a vertex
v in Q∗ to ¯v, the image of v in T (A) under the canonical surjection KQT → T (A).
We deﬁne ϕ on arrows as follows. If a is an arrow in Q ⊆ Q∗ , let ϕ(a) = (a, 0). If
m ∈ M, then ϕ(am) = (0, m∨). Note that am is an arrow from t(m) to s(m) and
that (0, m∨) = (et(m), 0)(0, m∨)(es(m), 0). By the universal mapping property of a path
algebra, we obtain a K-algebra homomorphism ϕ : KQ∗ → T (A). By Proposition 4.2,
ϕ is a surjection.

Next we show that I ∗ (deﬁned in Section 3) is contained in ker(ϕ). For this, we prove
that relations of Types 1, 2, and 3 are in ker(ϕ). Recall that S is deﬁned to be the set
of simple cycles in Q∗ that are cyclic permutations of the cycles mam, for some m ∈ M.
We begin with a Type 1 relation. Let C, C ′ ∈ S be cycles in S at a vertex v ∈ Q∗.
We need to show that ϕ(C − C ′) = 0. Let m, m′M, p, q, p′, q′ ∈ ¯B such that pq = m,
p′q′ = am′, C = qamp, and C ′ = q′am′p′. Then ϕ(C) = (p, 0)(0, m∨)(q, 0). Since C is a
cycle at v, by Lemma 4.1, (p, 0)(0, m∨)(q, 0) = (0.qm∨p) = (0, r∨) where prq = m. It
follows that r = ev since pevq = m. Thus, we have shown that ϕ(C) = (0, e∨
v ). By a
similar argument, ϕ(C ′) = (0, e∨

v ) and we conclude that ϕ(C − C ′) = 0.

Next we show that Type 2 relations are sent to 0 by ϕ. Let C ∈ S is a cycle at v,
with ﬁrst arrow b. Either b is an arrow in Q or b = am for some m ∈ M. Then
ϕ(Cb) = (0, e∨
v ) 6= 0
then (0, be∨
If
b = am, for some m ∈ M, then ϕ(Cb) = (0, e∨
v )(0, m∨) = 0 by Lemma 4.1. Hence we
have shown that Type 2 relations are sent to 0 under ϕ.

v ) = (0, r∨) where rb = ev, which is not possible since b is an arrow.

v )ϕ(b). If b is an arrow in Q, then (0, e∨

v )(b, 0) = (0, be∨

v ). If (0, be∨

Finally, let ab be a Type 3 relation. We want to show that ϕ(ab) = 0. There are 4
cases: both a and b are arrows in Q, a is an arrow in Q and b = am for some m ∈ M,
b is an arrow in Q and a = am for some m ∈ M, and a = am, b = am′ for some
m, m′ ∈ M. If both a and b are arrows in Q, then since ab is a relation in A∗ and hence
ab = 0. Next suppose that a is an arrow in Q and b = am for some m ∈ M. Then
ϕ(aam) = (a, 0)(0, m∨) = (0, am∨).
If (0, am∨) 6= 0, then (0, am∨) = (0, r∨) where
ra = m. But then a is the last arrow in m and aam is not a Type 2 relation. The case
where a = am for some m ∈ M and b is an arrow is handled in a similar fashion to
the last case. The ﬁnal case is when a = am and b = am′ for some m, m′ ∈ M. Then
ϕ(ab) = (0, m∨)(0, m′ ∨) = 0 by 4.1(4). This completes the proof that ϕ(I ∗) = 0.

8

GREEN AND SCHROLL

Since ϕ : KQ∗ → T (A) is a surjection and ϕ(I ∗) = 0, ϕ induces a surjection
ψ : KQ∗/I ∗ → T (A). Now A∗ = KQ∗/I ∗ and by Proposition 3.2, dimK (A∗) =
2 dimK (A). Clearly, dimK(T (A) = 2 dimK(A). Hence ψ : A∗ → T (A) is an isomor-
phism.
(cid:3)

5. Admissible cuts

Let Λ = KQΛ/IΛ be the symmetric special multiserial algebra given by the deﬁning pair
(S, µ). There is an equivalence relation on S given by two special cycles are equivalent
if one is a cyclic permutation of the other. Let {C1, . . . , Ct} be a set of equivalence
class representatives.

Deﬁnition 5.1. An admissible cut D of QΛ is a subset of arrows in QΛ consisting of
exactly one arrow in each special cycle Ci, for i = 1, . . . , t. We call kQΛ/hIΛ ∪ Di the
cut algebra associated to D where hIΛ ∪ Di is the ideal generated by IΛ ∪ D.

We show the following theorem.

CutAlmostGentle Theorem 5.2. Let Λ = KQΛ/IΛ be the symmetric special multiserial algebra deﬁned
by a deﬁning pair (S, µ) and let D be an admissible cut of QΛ. Set Q to be the quiver
given by Q0 = (QΛ)0 and Q1 = (QΛ)1 \ D . Then the cut algebra, KQΛ/hIΛ ∪ Di,
associated to D is isomorphic to KQ/(IΛ ∩ KQ).

Moreover, KQ/(IΛ ∩ KQ) is an almost gentle algebra.

Proof. The inclusion of quivers Q ⊂ QΛ induces a K-algebra homomorphism f : KQ →

follows that f is surjective.

where the ﬁrst sum runs over all paths q such that no arrow of D occurs in q and the
second sum runs over all paths r in Q such that there is at least one arrow of D in

KQΛ/hIΛ ∪ Di. We show that f is surjective. Let Pp λpp be an element in KQΛ; that
is, λp ∈ K, with almost all λp = 0 and p a path in QΛ. ThenPp λpp =Pq λqq +Pr λrr
r. Then P λrr is in the ideal hIΛ ∪ Di and P λqq is in the image of KQ in KQΛ. It
f (P λpp) = 0. Then P λpp is in hIΛ ∪ Di. Thus
X λpp =
X λr,sr(C µ(C)−(C ′µ(C ′)))s+X λr′,s′r′C µ(C)as′+X λr′′,s′′r′′abs′′+X λr′′′,s′′′r′′′ads′′′,

We now show that ker f = IΛ ∩ KQ. Clearly IΛ ∩ KQ ⊂ ker f . Now suppose that

where the λ∗,∗ are elements of K, the r, r′, r′′, r′′′, s, s′, s′′, s′′′ are paths, the C µ(C) −
(C ′µ(C ′)) are Type 1 relations, the C µ(C)a are Type 2 relations, the ab are Type 3
relations, and the ad are arrows in D. Since the left hand side is a K-linear combination
of paths in Q, the sum of all paths having at least one arrow in D on the right hand
side must equal 0. Each C ∈ S has an arrow in D, so we conclude that

where ab is a Type 3 relation and no arrow in D occurs in any r′′abs′′. Noting that
such ab are in IΛ ∩ KQ, we conclude that f is an isomorphism.

X λpp =X λr′′,s′′r′′abs′′,

It also follows from the above that the relations in IΛ ∩ KQ are monomial quadratic.
Suppose ab /∈ IΛ ∩ KQ and ab′ /∈ IΛ ∩ KQ for a, b, b′ ∈ Q1. Then ab /∈ IΛ and ab′ /∈ IΛ
which is a contradication since by [GS2] KQΛ/IΛ is special multiserial. Similarly we
see that, given an arrow in Q, there is at most one arrow c ∈ Q1 such that ca /∈
IΛ ∩ KQ. Hence, KQ/(IΛ ∩ KQ) is a special multiserial algebra and we have shown
that KQ/(IΛ ∩ KQ) is an almost gentle algebra.
(cid:3)

The next result shows that if one starts with an almost gentle algebra and takes the
appropriate admissible cut in the trivial extension of the almost gentle algebra by its
dual, then the almost gentle algebra is isomorphic to the cut algebra.

Theorem 5.3. Let A = KQ/I be an almost gentle algebra with set of maximal paths
M and let T (A) = QT (A) be the trivial extension of A by D(A) where the set of new
arrows of QT (A) is given by D = {βm, m ∈ M}. Then D is an admissible cut of QT (A)
and the cut algebra associated to D is isomorphic to A.

Proof. It follows from the construction of T (A) that there exists exactly one arrow from
D in any special cycle. Hence D is an admissible cut of T (A). The constructions in
Theorem 5.2 give the result.

The next result shows that if one starts with a symmetric special multiserial algebra
deﬁned by a deﬁning pair (S, µ) and µ ≡ 1 and an admissible cut D then the algebra
associated D, trivially extended by its dual, is isomorphic to the original symmetric
special multiserial algebra.

Theorem 5.4. Let Λ = KQΛ/IΛ be a symmetric special multiserial algebra deﬁned by
the deﬁning pair (S, µ) and assume that µ ≡ 1. Let D be an admissible cut of QΛ.
Denote by A = KQ/I the cut algebra associated to D. Then T (A) is isomorphic to Λ.

Proof. The special cycles in QΛ are of the form C = p1βp2, for β ∈ D and where
p1 = a1 . . . ar and p2 = ar+1 . . . as. We now show that p2p1 is a maximal path in A.
Since C is a special cycle, we have special cycles p2p1β and βp2p1. Thus, p2p1 /∈ IΛ
and hence p2p1 /∈ IΛ ∩ KQ. Since Λ is a special multiserial algebra, and both arβ and
βar+1 are not in IΛ, we see that arb and bar+1 are in IΛ for all arrows b ∈ Q. Thus
A is an almost gentle algebra since I = IΛ ∩ KQ is generated by quadratic monomials
and is special multiserial. It is now easy to see that T (A) is isomorphic to Λ.

Consider the set of pairs (Λ, D) such that Λ = KQΛ/IΛ is a symmetric special mul-
tiserial K-algebra and D is an admissible cut in QΛ. We say (Λ, D) and (Λ′, D′) are
equivalent if there is a K-algebra isomorphism from Λ to Λ′ sending D to D′ and let
X denote the equivalent classes. The next result is an immediate consequence of the
previous two theorems.

Corollary 5.5. There is a bijection ϕ : A −→ X from the set A of isomorphism
classes of almost gentle algebras to the set X of equivalence classes of pairs consisting
of a symmetric special multiserial algebra and a cut as deﬁned above. The isomorphism
is given, for A ∈ A, by ϕ(A) = (T (A), D) where D = {βm | m a maximal path in A}.

GREEN AND SCHROLL

Moreover, for (Λ, D) ∈ X , we have ϕ−1(Λ, D) = A where A is the isomorphism class
of the algebras associated to the cut D.

Remark 5.6. 1) Given a symmetric special multiserial algebra Λ = KQΛ/IΛ, two
distinct admissible cuts of QΛ yield, in general, non-isomorphic, non derived equivalent
cut algebras A and A′. We note that A and A′ have the same number of simple modules
and dimK A = dimK A′. But there are examples where gldimA < ∞ and gldimA′ = ∞.

2) If Λ = KQΛ/IΛ is of ﬁnite (resp. tame) representation type then any cut algebra
associated to a cut of QΛ is of ﬁnite (resp. tame) representation type. To see this,
suppose that A is the cut algebra of Λ associated to an admissible cut. Then Λ is
isomorphic to T (A) and there is a full faithful embedding of the category of ﬁnitely
generated A-modules into the category of ﬁnitely generated Λ-modules.

Let Λ = KQΛ/IΛ be a symmetric special multiserial algebra and (S, µ) be a deﬁning
pair in QΛ so that Λ is deﬁned by (S, µ). If µ is identically equal to 1, we say that Λ has
multiplicity function identically equal to 1. Note that if one views Λ as a Brauer con-
ﬁguration algebra with multiplicity function ν, this corresponds to ν being identically
equal to one.

Corollary 5.7. Every symmetric special multiserial algebra with multiplicity function
identically equal to one in its deﬁning pair is a trivial extension of an almost gentle
algebra.
