In this paper, we study early-time inﬂation and late-time acceleration of the universe in the pres-
ence of non-minimal coupling the Dirac ﬁeld with torsion in the spatially ﬂat Friedman-Robertson-
Walker (FRW) cosmological model background by using the Noether symmetry approach. The
results obtained by the Noether symmetry approach with and without a gauge term are compared.
Additionally, we compare these results with the results obtained in the context of the 3+1 dimen-
sional teleparallel gravity under Noether symmetry approach, and we see that the two models have
similar physically results about the inﬂation of the universe.

INTRODUCTION

The recent cosmological observational data point out
that our universe has two acceleration periods: early-
time and late-time cosmic acceleration. Some cosmolog-
ical diﬃculties, such as the initial singularity problem,
the ﬂatness problem, and the horizon problem, are re-
solved by using the early-time inﬂation scenario with a
scalar ﬁeld as a source of quantum ﬂuctuations [1, 2]. On
the other hand, the late-time inﬂation scenario is due to
the observed accelerating expansion of the present uni-
verse [3–5], which the acceleration is explained with a
negative pressure component which is called dark energy.
The models including diﬀerent dark energy forms, such
as cosmological constant [6, 7], canonical scalar ﬁeld (i.e.
quintessence) [8? ], and a phantom ﬁeld [10, 11], have
been discussed widely in the context of the standard Ein-
stein relativity.

The Teleparallel gravity is one of the modiﬁed theories
which has an alternative geometrical formulation of the
Einstein’s general relativity. It was ﬁrstly introduced by
Einstein to merge the gravitation with electromagnetism
[12]. Though the spacetime structure in the standart Ein-
stein general relativity is described by a Levi-Civita con-
nection which has free-torsion, but, non-vanishing cur-
vature, the spacetime structure in the teleparallel grav-
ity is constructed by a Weitzenbock connection which is
characterized by the metricity condition and vanishing
curvature, but it has a torsion. Also, diﬀerent from the
standard Einstein relativity, the teleparallel gravity is a
gauge theory of the spacetime translation group [13–16].
In recent decades, the 2 + 1 dimensional gravitation
theories, such as the standard Einstein general relativity
[17, 18], the new massive gravity [20, 21], the topolog-
ical massive gravity [24–26] and the teleparallel gravity
[27–29], have attracted considerable attention in the lit-
erature. In particuliar, the 2+1 dimensional teleparallel
theory covers an important place among the 2+1 dimen-

sional gravity theories because it has a Newtonian limit, a
black hole solution [27] and a gravitational wave solution
named Siklos waves that are a special class of the exact
gravitational waves propagating on the AdS background
[30]. Also, the other black hole solutions are performed
in the context of the 2 + 1 dimensional teleparallel grav-
ity [31], f (T ) gravity [32], Maxwell-f (T ) gravity [33] and
torsion scalar coupled with a scalar ﬁeld non-minimally
[34].

As the Dirac theory has a vacuum including Zitterbe-
wegung oscillations between positive and negative energy
states and perfectly explains an interaction a Dirac par-
ticle with an atomic structure of the materials, it gives a
reasonable cosmological solutions for the early-time in-
ﬂation and late-time acceleration of the universe [35].
Therefore, in this study, we non-minimally couple the
Dirac ﬁeld with the torsion scalar and consider the Dirac
ﬁeld as a source of early-time inﬂation and late-time ac-
celeration in the context of the 2 + 1 dimensional telepar-
allel gravity on the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
background by using the Noether gauge symmetry ap-
proach. At same time, we show that the cosmological
solutions obtained in the context of the 2 + 1 dimen-
sional teleparallel gravity are compatible with the results
which are in the coupling the Dirac ﬁeld with the 3 + 1
dimensional gravity theories [36–38] and with the 2 + 1
dimensional Einstein gravity [35].

This paper is organized as follows. In the following sec-
tion, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld equations in which the Dirac ﬁeld is
non-minimal coupled with the 2 + 1 dimensional telepar-
allel gravity. In Section 3, we search the Noether gauge
symmetry for the Lagrangian of the theory with a Dirac
ﬁeld. In Section 4, we obtain the solutions of the ﬁeld
equations by using Noether gauge symmetry approach.
Furthermore, in this section we ﬁnd solutions to the ﬁeld
equations under the zero-gauge term condition, and com-
pared these results with the results of study performed in
the 3+1 dimensional teleparallel gravity. Finally, in the
Section 5, we conclude with a summary of the obtained
results. Throughout the paper, we use c = G =  = 1.

the Dirac matrices dependent on spacetime coordinates,
¯σµ(x), are deﬁned in terms of the ﬂat spacetime Dirac
matrices and the dreibeins as follows;

¯σµ(x) = eµ

(i)(x)¯σi,

where ¯σi are

¯σ0 = σ3, ¯σ1 = iσ1, ¯σ2 = iσ2

(5)

(6)

and σ1, σ2 and σ3 are the standard 2 × 2 Pauli matrices.
In this representation, the Dirac equation has important
applications in the curved spacetimes [19, 22, 23, 48, 49].
To investigate the inﬂationary problem in the context
of the 2+1 dimensional teleparallel gravity, we will con-
sider the 2+1 dimensional FRW spacetime background
(7) that is spatially ﬂat, homogeneous and isotropic uni-
verse as follows;

ds2 = dt2 − a2(t)[dx2 + dy2],

(7)

where a(t) is the scale factor of the universe. For the

metric, the torsion scalar becomes T = −2(cid:16) ˙a2

the dot represents diﬀerentiation with respect to cosmic
time, t. After similar calculations in the [35], the point-
like Lagrangian of the system can be written from the
action (4) in the following form:

a2(cid:17), where

L = 2F ˙a2 −

ıa2

2 (cid:16) ¯ψσ3 ˙ψ − ˙¯ψσ3ψ(cid:17) + a2V,

(8)

where V = V (Ψ). The Dirac’s equations for the spinor
ﬁeld ψ and its adjoint ¯ψ are obtained from the Lagrangian
(8) such that the Euler-Lagrange equations of the ψ and
¯ψ are, respectively,

˙ψ + Hψ + iV ′σ3ψ + 2iH 2F ′σ3ψ = 0,
˙¯ψ + H ¯ψ − iV ′ ¯ψσ3 − 2iH 2F ′ ¯ψσ3 = 0,

(9)

(10)

where H = ˙a/a corresponds the Hubble parameter and
the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the bi-
linear Ψ. Furthermore, letting the point-like Lagrangian
(8) and the Dirac’s equations, we ﬁnd the second order
Euler-Lagrange equation for a, i.e. the acceleration equa-
tion,

II. THE FIELD EQUATIONS

The investigations on the interaction between a torsion
and a Dirac fermionic spinorial ﬁeld have attracted at-
tention for a long time [39–42, 44–46]. The main purpose
of these studies are to construct a modiﬁed gravitational
theories naturally including a spin eﬀect of the matter
ﬁelds.
In order to construct the teleparallel version of
the Lagrangian density for a Dirac ﬁeld, it is necessary
to deﬁne the correct teleparallel version of the spin con-
nection. Accordingly, thanks to the equivalence of the
teleparallel theory to the standard general relativity the-
ory, the teleparallel spin connection is given by minus
the contortion tensor plus a zero-connection as follows
[42, 43, 47];

where the ωa

Furthermore, the torsion tensor is deﬁned in terms of the

µ, as follows;

µν = e β

Accordingly, the teleparallel version covariant derivatives
of the Dirac spinor, ψ, and its adjoint, ¯ψ, are written,
respectively,

with a torsion scalar is given by

and g is determinant of the metric tensor, gµν, deﬁn-
ing in terms of the dreibeins and the 2+1 dimensional

where ρf represents the eﬀective energy density and it is

III. THE NOETHER SYMMETRY APPROACH

The symmetry conception has always played a central
role in physics because it is directly associated with the
conservation laws of a dynamical system [50]. These con-
nections between symmetries and conservation laws of a
dynamical system is expressed by the Noether’s theorem
[51]. So, in this study, the existence of Noether sym-
metries lead to a speciﬁc form of coupling function and
the self-interaction potential, which they are important
for obtaining the exact solutions to ﬁelds equations [52–
54, 57–60]. Mathematically, the Noether symmetry con-
dition for the system where the Dirac ﬁeld coupled with
the 2+1 dimensional gravity, with a non-zero gauge term,
can express as follows. The Noether symmetry condition
with a gauge term is [35, 55–57, 61]

X[1]L + L(Dtτ ) = DtB,

So that, the form of the bilinear function is calculated as

(40)

where Ψ0 is a constant of integration. Then, the ﬁrst inte-
gral equation (38), becomes as I2 = − ıΨ0

inserting the equations (40) and the coupling function
(29) in the ﬁrst integral (37), we gets

where a0 is an integration constant. Using the solution

mann equation (14), we obtain a constraint relations be-
tween the constants as λ= I 2
1 (k−1)2
0f0(k+1)2 . Under these con-
2Ψ2
ditions, the scale factor that is obtained from the Noether
gauge symmetry represents a power law expansion for the
universe. From (42), we see that the scale factor, a(t), is
up to the parameter k, which it corresponds diﬀerent cos-
mological models for k values: for k ∈ (1/3,∞) obey an
accelerated power law expansion and for k ∈ (−∞, 1/3)
a decelerated expansion occurs. Also, for k = 1/3, we
have

a(t) =

(43)

This solution corresponding to a universe with the pres-
sureless Dirac ﬁeld, that is similar to the matter (or dust)
dominant universe in the standard 2+1 dimensional gen-
eral relativity [62]. Therefore, this solution shows that
the Dirac ﬁeld behaves as a standard pressureless matter
ﬁeld in the 2 + 1 dimensional teleparallel gravity.

Furthermore, we can deﬁne the equation of state pa-
rameter of the fermionic ﬁeld by using the energy den-
sity (15) and pressure (12) as ωf =pf /ρf to search that
whether the fermionic ﬁeld can provide alternative for
dark energy or not. Considering the equations (29), (30),
(40) and (42), we obtain

To solve the ﬁeld equations, and hence determine the
time evolution of the scale factor, ﬁrstly, we need to know

ωf =

1 − 3k
k + 1

.

(44)

Based on the recently astrophysical observational data
[63, 64], the equation of the state parameter tends to
value −1. Additionally, as the equation of the state pa-
rameter is less than −1 the dark energy is described by
phantom, but, for ω ∈ (−1,−1/3) the quintessence dark
energy is observed and the case ω=−1 corresponds to
the cosmological constant. In the present work, we ob-
served that, the case k ∈ (1/2, 1) corresponding to the
quintessence phase, and the case k ∈ (1,∞) is corre-
sponding to the phantom phase. In both cases, the uni-
verse is both expanding and accelerating. Therefore, the
results show that the fermionic ﬁeld may behave like both
quintessence and phantom dark energy ﬁeld in the late-
time universe.

For the case k=1 so that the coupling and potential
functions have linear forms of Ψ from the equation (29)
and (30) as follows

F (Ψ) = f0Ψ,

V (Ψ) = λΨ.

(45)

(46)

Therefore, without the Noether symmetry, the Fried-
mann equation (14) is reduced to

˙a

a −s λ

2f0

= 0,

(47)

which has the solution

a(t) = a0eH0t, where H0 =s λ

2f0

(48)

where a0 is a constant. It is clear that this solution is
corresponding to the de Sitter solution that describes an
inﬂationary epoch of the universe. Hence, it can be con-
cluded that the Dirac ﬁeld plays a role as an inﬂaton ﬁeld
in the 2 + 1 dimensional teleparallel gravity. Addition-
ally, from Eqs. (15) and (12), the energy density and the
pressure of the Dirac ﬁeld are given by

ρf =

λΨ0

e−2H0t,

pf = −ρf .

(49)

Additionally, the equation of state parameter calculate as
ωf =−1 that corresponding to the cosmological constant.
It is interesting to note that in the case of vanishing
the gauge term (i.e., B=0), the partial diﬀerential equa-
tions Eqs.(21)-(27) reduced to the equations for the usual
Noether symmetry approach. Hence, in a similar form of
the Eqs.(42), the scale factor obtained as

1−k

(50)

a (t) = [ea0 (k − 1) (t − a1)]

where a1 integration constant andea0= λΨ1−k

. This solu-
tion is the same as the results obtained in the context of
non-minimal coupling the fermionic ﬁeld to the torsion
in 3+1 dimensional teleparallel gravity [38]. According

to this solution, the universe is accelerating for k > 0
and decelerating for k < 0. Also, the cases k ∈ (1/3, 1),
k ∈ (1,∞) and k=1 are correspond to the quintessence
phase, to the phantom phase and to the cosmological con-
stant, respectivelly. Hence, we can say that the fermionic
ﬁeld causes the same physical eﬀect on the universe’s his-
tory in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional teleparallel grav-
ity theories when the Noether symmetry (with or without
gauge term) used. On the other hand, there is a similar
equivalence between the 2+1 [35] and 3+1 [37] dimension
Einstein gravities under Noether symmetry approach in
the presence of the non-minimal coupling the fermionic
ﬁeld to curvature scalar.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The investigations to obtain a suitable components
that can explain the early-time inﬂation and late-time
acceleration epoch of the universe is one of the main
topics of modern cosmology.
In this context, we con-
sider the non-minimal coupling of the Dirac ﬁeld to tor-
sion in the context of teleparallel theory of gravity in
2+1 dimensional Weitzenbock spacetime, and hence, it
is investigated how dirac ﬁelds may be responsible for
the early-time inﬂation and late-time acceleration. The
identiﬁcation of the non-minimal coupling and the self-
interaction functions are performed by using the Noether
symmetry approach with and without a gauge term. We
can summarize the results as follows;

• For the case k=1, the scale factor obtained in Eqs.
(48) as a(t)=a0eH0t, that indicate the inﬂation
epoch of the universe. Also this solution corre-
sponds to vacuum energy which characterized by
cosmological constant.

• The case k ∈ (1/2, 1) conform to the quintessence
dark energy component that is used to explain the
late-time acceleration. Accordingly, we can say
that Dirac ﬁeld play an important role in the in-
ﬂation phases of the universe.

• The case k ∈ (1,∞) is corresponding to the phan-
tom dark energy component.This component, also,
used to explain the late-time acceleration.

• For k=1/3, we obtain a solution correspond to the
matter (or dust) dominant universe with the pres-
sure of the Dirac ﬁeld pf =0 as in the 2 + 1 dimen-
sional General Relativity [62]. Hence, it shows that
the Dirac ﬁeld behaves as a standard pressureless
matter ﬁeld in the 2 + 1 dimensional teleparallel
gravity.

that this solution is the same as the results ob-
tained in the context of non-minimal coupling the
fermionic ﬁeld to the torsion in 3+1 dimensional
teleparallel gravity [38]. Hence, it can say that, in
the presence of the fermionic ﬁeld, the 2+1 dimen-
sional teleparallel gravity is equivalent to the 3+1
dimensional teleparallel gravity when the Noether
symmetry (with or without gauge term) is used.

• It is important to emphasize that in the presence
of the fermionic ﬁeld and under the Noether sym-
metry approach with a gauge term, the 2+1 dimen-
sional Einstein gravity has a similar physical results
about the history of the universe that of both 2+1

and 3+1 dimensional teleparallel gravities [35].

Finally, it can be say that the Dirac ﬁeld can be seen
as an inﬂaton able to explain the acceleration of the Uni-
verse both in the early time epoch and in the late-time
epoch.
