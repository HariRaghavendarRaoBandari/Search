Abstract

Within the framework of the previous paper [8], we develop a generalized stochastic calculus for processes
associated to higher order diﬀusion operators. Applications to the study of a Cauchy problem, a Feynman-Kac
formula and a representation formula for higher derivatives of analytic functions are also given.

Keywords: generalized Itˆo calculus, probabilistic representation of solutions of PDEs, stochastic processes on
the complex plane.

1. Introduction

One of the main instances of the fruitful interplay between analysis and probability is the connection between
parabolic equations associated to second-order elliptic operators and the theory of Markov processes. The main
consequence of this extensively studied topic is the famous Feynman-Kac formula, providing a representation
0 (Rd) (the continuous functions vanishing at inﬁnity)
of the solution of the heat equation with potential V ∈ C∞

∂t u(t, x) = 1
u(0, x) = f (x)

in terms of an integral with respect to the distribution of the Wiener process, the mathematical model of the
Brownian motion:

e− R t

0 V (ω(s)+x)dsf (ω(t) + x) dW (ω).

(2)

u(t, x) =ZCt

In fact a probabilistic representation of this form cannot be written in the case of semigroups whose generator
does not satisfy the maximum principle. In particular if the Laplacian in Eq (1) is replaced with an higher
order diﬀerential operator, i.e. if we consider a Cauchy problem of the form

∂t u(t, x) = (−1)n+1∆nu(t, x) − V (x)u(t, x),
u(0, x) = f (x),

(cid:26) ∂

t ∈ R+, x ∈ Rd,

with n ∈ N, n ≥ 2, then a formula analogous to (2), giving the solution of (3) in terms of the expectation with
respect to the measure associated to a Markov process, is lacking and it is not possible to ﬁnd a stochastic
process which plays for the parabolic equation (3) the same role that the Wiener process plays for the heat
equation. The problem of how to overcome this limitation has been studied by means of diﬀerent techniques
and two main approaches have been proposed. The ﬁrst one was introduced by V. Yu. Krylov in 1960 [18] and

further developed by K. Hochberg in 1978 [14]. The solution of (3) is constructed in terms of the expectation
with respect to a signed measure with inﬁnite total variation on a space of paths on the interval [0, t]. This
approach is related to the theory of pseudoprocesses, i.e. processes associated to signed instead of probability
measures. It is important to recall that due to the particular conditions necessary for the generalization of the
Kolmogorov existence theorem for the limit of a projective system of complex measures (see [30]), in the case of
Krylov-Hochberg process, a well deﬁned signed measure on R[0,t] cannot exist and the ”integrals” realizing the
Feynman-Kac formula for equation (3) are just formal expressions which cannot make sense in the framework
of Lebesgue integration theory but are to be meant as limit of a particular approximating sequence. However,
even taking into account these technical problems, an analog of the arc-sine law [14, 16, 19], of the central
limit theorem [15, 29] and of Itˆo formula and Ito stochastic calculus [14, 25] have been developed for the (ﬁnite
additive) Krylov-Hochberg signed measure. For a extensive discussion of these problems in the framework of a
generalized integration theory on inﬁnite dimensional spaces as well as for a uniﬁed view of probabilistic and
complex integration see [1, 2]. It is worthwhile to mention the work by D. Levin and T. Lyons [22] on rough
paths, conjecturing that the above mentioned signed measure could be ﬁnite if deﬁned on the quotient space of
equivalence classes of paths corresponding to diﬀerent parametrization of the same path.

A diﬀerent approach, introduced by T. Funaki [13] for the case where n = 2, is based on the construction
of a stochastic process (with dependent increments) on the complex plane. Funaki’s process is obtained by
composing two independent Brownian motions and has some relations with the iterated Brownian motion [9, 3].
Furthermore this approach is related with the theory of Bochner subordination [7] and can be applied to partial
diﬀerential equations of even and odd order 2n, by multiple iterations of suitable processes [13, 17, 27, 26].
Complex valued processes, connected to PDE of the form (3) have been also proposed by other authors by
means of diﬀerent techniques [21]. In [23, 11] K. Burdzy and A. Madrecki consider equation (26) with n = 2
and V ≡ 0, constructig a probabilistic representation for its solution in terms of a stable probabilistic Borel
measure m on the space Ω = C([0, t], C∞) of continuous mappings on [0, t] with values in the set C∞ of complex
valued sequences, endowed with the product topology. In this setting a Feynman-Kac type formula is proved
∂4u
for the fourth order heat-type equation with linear potential. ∂u
∂x4 + (iax + b)u. By means of the theory
of inﬁnite dimensional Fresnel integral, in [24] a Feynman-Kac-type formula for equation (3) has been proved
for potentials V which are Fourier transform of complex bounded measures on the real line.

∂t = 1

In a recent paper [8], two of the authors have introduced a diﬀerent approach which is rather simple and

elegant, providing the solution of the parabolic Cauchy problem

(where N > 2 is an integer constant, α ∈ C and f : R → C is the initial datum) in terms of the expectation
with respect to a the law of a sequence of random walks {W N
n , n ∈ N} on the complex plane. The main idea
in [8] is the construction of a sequence of processes which play for the PDE (4) of order N the same role that
the Wiener process plays for the heat equation. Let (Ω, F , P) be a probability space, α ∈ C \ {0} be a complex
number and N ≥ 1 a given integer. Let

R(N ) = {e2iπk/N , k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1}

be the roots of unity. Throughout the paper ξ will denote a uniformly distributed random variable on the set
α1/N R(N ). Given a sequence {ξk} of i.i.d. random variables ξk ∼ ξ, we deﬁne the complex stochastic process

For each n, the process W n is a random walk on the complex plane, which is geometrically aligned and precisely
scaled to extract information about the N -th complex derivative of analytic functions [8]. This claim will be
made clear in the course of the paper.

If α = 1 and N = 2 the process Wn converges weakly [6] to the Wiener process and the Feynman-Kac

formula (2) (for V ≡ 0) can be written as

u(t, x) = lim
n→∞

E [f (Wn(t) + x)] .

(6)

For N > 2 the sequence of processes Wn cannot converge because of the particular scaling exponent 1/N
(directly related with the order of the PDE (4)) appearing in the denominator on the right hand side of (5).
However for a restricted class of functions f : C → C the limit in (6) still exists providing a representation for
the solution of (4) (see [8]).

Notice that W n are in fact pre-Brownian motions, rescaled so they diverge in the limit due to the factor
n−1/N when N > 2. Asymptotically their paths have the geometric properties of Brownian motion. To see this,
we calculate the real 2-dimensional variance

E(cid:0)|W n(t) − EW n(t)|2(cid:1) = E|W n(t)|2 = E

Thus if we reparametrize to the process ¯W n(t) = W n(t/n1−2/N ) the random walk ¯W n(t) has real 2-dimensional
variance ⌊n2/N t⌋
and so, by Donsker’s Theorem, converges to a 2-dimensional Brownian motion as n → ∞ for
n2/N
N > 2. In this sense (since paths do not depend on the parametrisation of the curves) the paths of W n have
the geometric properties of paths of Brownian motion in the limit as n → ∞.

In this paper, we improve the construction of [8] with the development of an Itˆo’s calculus for the limit law
of the random walks W n. To achieve our aim, we ﬁrst analyze the behaviour of the random walks W n, with
particular regard to the estimates on the moments and Fourier’s transform of W n.
Then, we introduce the analog of Itˆo’s calculus. Heuristically, the rescaling n1/N in the construction of W n
(by comparing with the classical construction, that correspond to the case N = 2) implies that only the N -th
moment behaves like dt in the limit, thus implying that all moments of lesser order shall be considered in the
Itˆo formula, while we can neglect moments of higher order in the limit.
Moreover, integrals with respect to the increments of the random walk W n and their moments lesser than N
shall be analogous to stochastic integrals and, consequently, shall have zero mean. In Theorem 18 we prove that
this intuition is indeed true, and we prove the following Itˆo formula (compare (25))

E[f (z + W n(t))] − f (z) =

u(t, z) = lim
n→∞

E[f (z + W n(t))],

this is equivalent to saying u(t, z) is a classical solution of the N -th order Cauchy problem (4).

We shall then extend this result in two directions. First, through a rather straightforward extension of
previous computations, we allow for a time-dependent coeﬃcient in front of the diﬀusion operator, constructing
the probabilistic representation for the solution of

(∂tu(t, x) = α

u(0, x) = f (x),

N ! a(t)∂N

x u(t, x),
x ∈ R.

(7)

Then we begin the analysis of a Feynman-Kac formula, and we show that for a time dependent potential which
is linear in the space variable, the classical solution of the initial value problem

( ∂

∂t u(t, z) = α
u(0, x) = f (x),

All these results require to choose a suitable class of functions for f . The ﬁrst, obvious remark, is f must
be extensible to the complex plane. Moreover, it is necessary to have estimates on the function and all its
derivatives in C. For the sake of simplicity, we shall limit ourselves to the classical case of analytic functions of
exponential type, see for instance [12] and deﬁnition 8.
Finally we study the properties of stopping time for the process W n, proving a suggestive formula for the N -th
order derivative of an analytic function

2. Random walk on the complex plane

The present section is devoted to the proof of some properties of the sequence of complex random walks

W n(t).

Let α ∈ C and N ∈ N with N > 2 and let us consider the complex random variable ξ uniformly distributed

on the set αR(N ), where R(N ) = {ei2πk/N , k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1} is the set of N −roots of unity. We have

Lemma 1. The random variable ξ has ﬁnite powers of every order

if m/N = n ∈ N, since e2iπn = 1 then each term in the sum is equal to 1; in the other case, we employ the
trigonometric sum

e2iπmk/N =

1 − e2iπm
1 − e2iπm/N = 0.

For a complex random variable X we deﬁne its characteristic function1as ψX (λ) := E[eiλX ]. We have

ψξ(λ) := E[eiλξ] =

The next lemma, which will be applied in section 5, provides an estimate of the characteristic function of ξ.

Lemma 2. Let |λ| ≤ R. Then there exists a constant C ∈ R such that

Proof. For the properties of the random variable ξ, setting zj := ei2πj/N , the function χ : C → C deﬁned as
χ(λ) := E[eλξ] is an entire analytic function with the following power series expansion:

Next we proceed to analyze the random walk W n on the complex place deﬁned by formula (5). The main
issue here is the analysis of the complex moments of the random walk and their asymptotic behavior as n → ∞.
The result that we obtain in Theorem 3, is necessary in order to handle the Itˆo’s formula introduced in the next
section.

the connection with the 2-dimensional Fourier transform, the complication would not improve the results in this paper

Remark 1. These statistics are interesting when we consider how the processes are related to the 2-dimensional
Wiener process, which has vanishing complex moments of all orders. The diﬀerence here is that the processes
W n have unbounded variance as n → ∞. If we rescale to ¯W as in the introduction, then all moments vanish.
To give some intuition for why the jN moments might be nonzero, consider the case N = 4. Roughly, the
idea is that the process is more likely to be near one of the 4 rays in the directions {1, i, −1, −i} than near the
rays rotated by π/4. To see this imagine a time when Re W n(t) ≫ 1. Then since Im W n(t) is independent
with mean 0, it is much more likely to be near 0 than it is to be near ±Re W n(t). Thus we see the underlying
geometry of the processes is not statistically symmetric, as revealed in the moments; this is despite the fact that
the paths converge to the fractal curves of the Wiener process, which are statistically symmetric.

The next results show why the random walk Wn can be regarded in a very weak sense as an N −stable

process, in the sense of Theorem 5.

Roughly, the idea is that a function of exponential type c is asymptotically bounded by ec|z|. Alternatively,

a necessary and suﬃcient condition is that c = lim supn→∞ |f (n)(x)| for one (and hence all) x ∈ C.

Lemma 9. If f is of exponential type, then it satisﬁes assumption (18).

Lemma 10. If f : C → C is the Fourier transform of a complex bounded variation measure µ on R with
compact support, then f satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 7.

Corollary 11. If f : C → C is the Fourier transform of a complex bounded variation measure µ on R with
compact support, then for all t ∈ R, x ∈ R

Remark 2. By the Paley-Wiener Theorem [28], any function f ∈ L2(R) of exponential type is the Fourier
transform of a function ˆf ∈ L2(R) with compact support.
More generally, any function f : C → C which is the Fourier transform of a complex bounded variation measure
µ on R with compact support is of exponential type, and furthermore it is bounded on the real line.

3. Itˆo calculus

We shall consider a sort of Itˆo calculus for suitable regular functions of the random walk W n that mimics
the development of classical stochastic diﬀerential equations. We begin by considering integrals with respect to
the processes (W n)k for arbitrary k ∈ N. Even if Theorem 6 and the estimate (10) would allow the development
of the theory for a more general class of analytic functions g, as stated in the introduction, we shall restrict to
the case where g is an analytic function of exponential type. This is suﬃcient for our purposes and will simplify
the notation.

We state here, for later use, the following theorem, which follows directly from Theorem 6 and Lemma 9.

Theorem 12. Let g(z) =P∞

k=0 akzk be an analytic function of exponential type c. Then

We deﬁne an Itˆo integral for the process g(W n(t)) as

g(W n(s)) dW n(s) =

Z t

⌊nt⌋−1

Xτ =0

and, for any k ∈ N,

g(W n( τ

⌊nt⌋−1

Xτ =0

g(W n( τ

n ))(ξτ +1)k.

(20)

Our next step is the analysis of expectations. Taking the mean in both sides of (20) and recalling that

W n( τ

n ) is independent from ξτ +1, we get

E(cid:20)Z t

0

g(W n(s)) d(W n(s))k(cid:21) =

1

nk/N

⌊nt⌋−1

Xτ =0

E[g(W n( τ

10

and recalling (9) we get

for k = N we have

E(cid:20)Z t

0

g(W n(s)) d(W n(s))k(cid:21) = 0

for all k 6= mN , m ∈ N;

(21)

E(cid:20)Z t

0

g(W n(s)) d(W n(s))N(cid:21) = αZ t

0

E[g(z + W n(s))] ds

and ﬁnally for k = mN , m ∈ N, m > 1:

E(cid:20)Z t

g(W n(s)) d(W n(s))mN(cid:21) =(cid:16) α

so we expect this to vanish to zero as n → ∞ when m > 1.

4. Diﬀusions

Xk=1

Proof. For simplicity, we let t = θ/n, θ ∈ N. By exploiting a telescopic sum and Taylor’s expansion of g we get

g(z + W n(t)) − g(z) =

θ−1

g(z + W n( τ +1

and the representation (23) follows by the interchange of sums which is allowed due to the absolute convergence
of the Taylor series.

Remark 3. The Itˆo’s formula for Brownian motion satisﬁes

E[g(z + B(t))] − g(z) =

which we can restate in terms of the random walk, as

lim
n→∞

E[g(z + W n(t))] − g(z) =

(24)

We aim to prove that (a suitable extension of ) (24) holds for the N -th order diﬀerential operator with respect
to the random walk on the complex plane deﬁned on the lattice generated by R(N ).

Let us state the aim of our construction.

Theorem 18. Assume that g is an analytic function of exponential type c, i.e., |g(k)(z)|1/k → c as k → ∞ for
every z ∈ C. Then we have

lim
n→∞

E[g(z + W n(t))] − g(z) =

Setting

α

N !Z t

0

lim
n→∞

E[∂N g(z + W n(s))] ds.

(25)

this is equivalent to say that u(t, z) is a classical solution of the N -th order Cauchy problem

u(t, z) = lim
n→∞

E[g(z + W n(t))],

∂tu(t, z) =

α
N !
u(0, z) = g(z),

∂N u(t, z),

12

(26)

Proof. By assumption, we can start from the Itˆo’s formula (23); by taking the expectation in both sides we get

E[g(z + W n(t)) − g(z)] =

∞

Xm=1

α

(mN )!(cid:16) α

n(cid:17)m−1Z t

0

E[∂mN g(z + W n(s))] ds

(27)

then we take the limit as n → ∞ and apply Corollary 16 to obtain (25).
The second claim of the theorem follows once we prove that

lim
n→∞

E[∂N g(z + W n(s))] = ∂N lim
n→∞

E[g(z + W n(s))]

Notice that, by Theorem 12, we can write

lim
n→∞

E[∂N g(z + W n(s))] =

so (26) follows.

For a generalization of these results to the case of the boundary value problem associated with (26) on a

bounded interval with Dirichelet, resp. Neumann, resp. periodic boundary conditions see also [8].

4.1. Itˆo formula for polynomials

Assume for this section that g(z) = cβ zβ is a polynomial of order β = bN . Then we can calculate some

examples using the extended Itˆo’s formula (25). Actually, we have

lim

E[g(z + W n(t))] − g(z) = cβ

4.2. Itˆo formula for Wiener-type integrals

Let ϕ : [0, T ] → C be a continuous and bounded function. Then we can deﬁne the Wiener integral

Z t

0

ϕ(s) dWn(s) =

⌊nt⌋−1

Xτ =0

and, for any k ≥ 1,

ϕ( τ

These formulas deﬁne, for “suﬃciently regular” ϕ : R → C, a family of stochastic processes Xk,n(t) =
0 ϕ(s) d(Wn(s))k which extend the construction of the previous section.

We have the following application, which generalizes Theorem 11 in [8].

Then the function u(t, x) deﬁned by

Proof. We may proceed as in the proof of Theorem 18. Let us consider the process Xn(t) =R t

search for an Itˆo formula for the process f (z + Xn(t)). Notice that

0 ϕ(s) dWn(s); we

f (z + Xn(t)) − f (z) =

E(cid:20)Z t

5. The Feynman-Kac formula

The results of the previous section, in particular Theorem 18 and Theorem 19 allow the proof of a probabilistic
representation for the solution of heat-type equation of order N > 2. In this section we generalize the second
statement of Theorem 18 to the case where a time dependent potential is added, proving a Feynman-Kac type
formula for the perturbed problem

(37)

u(t, x) = lim
n→∞

Ehf (x + Wn(t))eR t

0 V (t−s,x+Wn(s))dsi

Since the sequence of processes {Wn(t)} does not properly converge, the existence of the limit on the right
hand side of Eq. (37) is not assured, even for smooth and bounded potential function V . Indeed the result of
section 2 allow to prove the ”asymptotic integrability” of cylinder functions of the form Wn 7→ f (Wn(t)), i.e.
the existence of the limit limn→∞ E[f (Wn(t))], for f entire analytic satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 6.
The construction of formula (37) requires in fact the proof of the integrability of more general (non-cylinder)

Let us consider now the initial value problem (36) with a time dependent potential which is linear in the
space variable, i.e. V : [0, t] × R → R is of the form V (τ, x) = A(τ )x, where A : [0, +∞) → R is a continuous
function. In this case the results of Theorem 20 allow us to prove the Feynman-Kac formula (37).

Theorem 21. Let A : [0, +∞) → R be a continuous function and f : R → C the Fourier transform of a complex
Borel measure on R with compact support. Then the classical solution of the initial value problem

u(t, x) = lim

Proof. By considering the function a : [0, t] → R deﬁned as a(s) := A(t − s), s ∈ [0, t] and by representing the

function f : R → C in the form f (x) = RR eiyxdµf (y), with µ Borel measure on R with compact support, we

obtain

Remark 4. Formula (40) is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus. For N = 1 and α = 1
the W n are deterministic and converge to the line W ∞

t = t. Then (40) reads

g(z + t) − g(z) =Z t

0

g′(z + s) ds

3by using the boundedness of τ and Corollary 16, just like in the proof of Theorem 18

17

for z + t being the ﬁrst hitting point to the boundary along the line to the right of z.

When N = 2 the process W n converges to the 1-dimensional Wiener process W and τn converges to the

Wiener process hitting time τ and we have

E[g(z + Wτ )] − g(z) =

1
2

EZ τ

0

g′′(z + Ws) ds

so the average value of the integral of g′′ from z to the boundary is the diﬀerence of the second antidervative
averaged on the boundary and at z. Notice Wτ has only 2 values, the hitting points to the right and left of
z, since W is the 1- dimensional Wiener process. E.g., in the particular, symmetric case of U being the disc
centered at z of radius r, we get

[g(z + r) − g(z)] + [g(z − r) − g(z)]

g′′(z + Ws) ds.

Now we specialize the previous formula to the case τn is the exit time of W n(t) from the ball B(0, R). We
shall see that an analytic function g(z) is determined by the average on the boundary of any ball B(z, R). This
is a generalization of Gauss’ mean value theorem for analytic functions, a classical result in complex analysis
for the case of Brownian motion.

Theorem 22. Let τn be the exit time of W n(t) from the ball B(0, R). Then

lim
n→∞

τn = 0

(41)

Proof. Let S(t), t ∈ N, be the random walk deﬁned by the ξj’s: S(t) =

is a martingale as well as |S(t)|2 − αt:

ξj. It is immediate to see that S(t)

where in the last equality we used the independence of ξi’s. Let An = {z ∈ C s. th. |z| ≤ Rn1/N } and

It is P(TAn < ∞) = 1 (see e.g. [Lawler 2010]); then the stopped martingale M n(t) = |S(t ∧ TAn)|2 − (t ∧ TAn)
satisﬁes

TAn = inf{t ≥ 0 s. th. S(t) 6∈ An}.

0 = E[M n(0)] = lim
t→∞

E(cid:2)|S(t ∧ TAn)|2 − (t ∧ TAn)(cid:3) = E(cid:2)|S(TAn )|2 − (TAn)(cid:3)

and using the estimate n2/N R2 ≤ |S(TAn)|2 ≤ n2/N R2 + 1 it follows that
n2/N R2 ≤ E[TAn ] ≤ n2/N R2 + 1.

Notice that

τn = inf(cid:26)s = j/n s. th.

i.e., τn = 1

which converges to 0 as n → ∞. Since τn is non-negative, this concludes the proof.

By using the bound |∂(n)g(0)| ≤ (c + ε)n for some ε > 0, where c is the exponential type of g, we get also

hence we can pass to the limit for n → ∞ in (42), recalling that τn → 0, and we get the thesis.
