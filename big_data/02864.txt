THE AUTONOMOUS NORM ON Ham (R2n) IS

BOUNDED

MICHAEL BRANDENBURSKY AND JAREK KĘDRA

Abstract. We prove that the autonomous norm on the group of
compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms of the standard
R2n is bounded.

Let (M, ω) be a symplectic manifold and let Ham(M, ω) be the group
of compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms of (M, ω). Re-
call that a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism f is a time-one map of the
ﬂow generated by the vector ﬁeld XFt deﬁned by ω(XFt, −) = dFt.
Here F : M × S 1 → R is a smooth compactly supported function and
F (x, t) = Ft(x) (see [9, Section 5.1] for details). The function F is
called a Hamiltonian of f . If F does not depend on the second variable
or is time independent then f is called autonomous. It is known that
every Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism is a product of autonomous ones [3].
The autonomous norm on Ham(M, ω) is deﬁned by:

kf k = min{k ∈ N | f = a1 · · · an, where ai is autonomous}.

It is a conjugation invariant norm and is known to be unbounded on
the group of compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms of an
oriented surface of ﬁnite area [2, 4, 3, 6].

This paper is concerned with the group Ham(R2n) of compactly sup-
ported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism of the Euclidean space equipped
with the standard symplectic form. We prove the following result.

Theorem. The diameter of the autonomous norm on Ham (R2n) is
bounded above by 3.

Proof. Let f ∈ Ham (R2n). Let f = a1 · · · am, where ai ∈ Ham (R2n)
are autonomous diﬀeomorphisms with compactly supported Hamilton-
ian functions Fi : R2n → R. Let B(r) ⊂ R2n be an Euclidean ball of
radius r > 0, centered at the origin and containing the union of the
supports of the functions Fi.

Lemma. There exists an autonomous diﬀeomorphism h ∈ Ham (R2n)
displacing the ball B(r) m times.

The statement of the lemma means that hi(B(r)) ∩ hj(B(r)) = ∅ for
0 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m.
It follows from [5, Lemma 2.6] that there exists
g ∈ Ham (R2n) such that the following equality holds:

f = a1 · · · am = [h, g]ah

1 ah2

2 · · · ahm
m ,

where ahi
i = hiaih−i and h is the diﬀeomorphism from the Lemma.
Observe that, since the supports of Fi ◦ hi are pairwise disjoint for i ∈
{1, . . . , m}, we obtain that the composition ah
m is autonomous
with the Hamiltonian function equal to

2 · · · ahm

1 ah2

F1 ◦ h + F2 ◦ h2 + · · · + Fm ◦ hm.

Since the commutator [h, g] = h · hg is a product of two autonomous
diﬀeomorphisms we obtain that f is a product of three autonomous
diﬀeomorphisms.

Proof of the Lemma. Let H1 : R → R be a smooth function satisfying
the following conditions:

(1) H1(y) = 0 for |y| > r + 1

(2) H ′

1(y) = r for |y| ≤ r.

Let H(x1, y1, . . . , xn, yn) = H1(y1). We have that dH = rdx1 and that
the induced Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld X is equal to r ∂
. Thus the
∂x1
induced Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism displaces the ball B(r) as many
times as we like. Taking an appropriate cut oﬀ function we obtain the
required compactly supported diﬀeomorphism h.

Remarks. If f in Theorem is contained in the kernel of the Calabi
homomorphism (see Section 8.B of [1] for a deﬁnition) then the same
argument shows that it is a product of up to three autonomous diﬀeo-
morphisms with trivial Calabi invariant.

It is known that the Hofer norm on Ham (R2n) is unbounded and stably
bounded [7]. The kernel of the Calabi homomorphism does not admit
nontrivial quasimorphisms, however, it is stably unbounded [8].

It is not diﬃcult to see that the diameter of the autonomous norm on
Ham (R2n) is at least 2. To the best of our knowledge it is an open
question whether there exists a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism of R2n of
autonomous norm equal to 3.
