Introduction

c (4450) in the J/ψp invariant mass distribution in the process of Λ0

Exploration of the exotic baryons that have more than three constituent quarks is an important
issue in hadron physics. Recently, observation of two hidden-charm pentaquark-like structures
c (4380) and P +
P +
b → J/ψpK−
decay was reported by the LHCb Collaboration [1]. The values of the masses and widths from
the ﬁt with the Breit–Wigner parameterization are MPc(4380) = (4380 ± 8 ± 29) MeV, ΓPc(4380) =
(205 ± 18 ± 86) MeV, MPc(4450) = (4449.8 ± 1.7 ± 2.5) MeV, and ΓPc(4450) = (39 ± 5 ± 19) MeV,
with spin-parity J P being either 3/2± or 5/2∓. Possible existence of such pentaquark states with
hidden charm has already been predicted [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] prior to the experimental observation. In
the earliest prediction [2], a ¯D∗Σc(2455) S-wave bound state with J P = 3/2− was predicted to be
around 4412 MeV with J/ψN as its largest decay mode, in the framework of the meson-baryon
coupled channel unitary approach with the local hidden gauge formalism. In this approach, the
t-channel vector meson exchange dominance is assumed for the ¯D∗Σc interaction. Taking into
account of other meson exchanges, the mass of the predicted ¯D∗Σc S-wave bound state could
be shifted by ±40 MeV [4]. Considering coupled channel eﬀects with ¯DΣ∗c and ¯D∗Σ∗c channels,
three J P = 3/2− pentaquark states were predicted to be around 4334 MeV, 4417 MeV and
4481 MeV, mainly coupled to ¯DΣ∗c , ¯D∗Σc and ¯D∗Σ∗c , respectively [5]. Therefore both P +
c (4380)
c (4450) could be the predicted ¯DΣ∗c and ¯D∗Σc states. The predicted masses for genuine
and P +
pentaquark states with both negative and positive parity [3] suﬀer large model dependence, but
also cover the observed masses of the two P +

c structures.

After the observation of the two P +

c structures, many theoretical works have been triggered, see
for example, Refs. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], proposing various explanations
for these structures. Among them, it was suggested that the observed structures could be due
to kinematical triangle singularities [14, 16], the possibility of which needs to be examined by
future experiments. If these two P +
structures correspond to two particle states, since they sit
c
close to the mass thresholds of the ¯DΣ∗c and ¯D∗Σc at 4387 MeV and 4461 MeV, respectively, a
popular explanation for them is still either S-wave ¯DΣ∗c (2520) or ¯D∗Σc(2455) molecular states [7,
−, roughly consistent with previous predictions [2, 4, 5] but with
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] with J P = 3
2
parameters tuned to reproduce the observed masses of P +
structures. However, the observed
c
decay width of the P +

c (4380) state is about a few times larger than the predicted one [2, 5].

In this work, we want to make an estimate of the partial decay widths of the Pc(4380) into the
¯D∗Λ+
c and J/ψp assuming it be a hadronic molecular state. We will point out that the previous
prediction [5] for the decay width of ¯DΣ∗c (2520) bound state underestimates the contribution of the
¯D∗Λ+
c decay by more than an order of magnitude due to its assumption of vector meson exchange
dominance. Rather than the J/ψp mode, the dominant decay mode for a ¯DΣ∗c (2520) bound state
should be ¯D∗Λ+
c due to t-channel pion exchange. We demonstrate that the relative ratio of the
decays of hidden charm P +
c to be
¯DΣ∗c (2520) or ¯D∗Σc(2455) molecular states. While the ¯DΣ∗c (2520) molecule decays dominantly
c , the ¯D∗Σc(2455) molecule has a larger branching fraction for the decay into the
into the ¯D∗Λ+
J/ψp. Therefore, were the Pc structures hadronic molecular states, future measurement of this
ratio can help us to pin down their nature. The unexpected large decay width of the P +
c (4380)
can get a natural explanation if it is a ¯DΣ∗c (2520) molecule.

c and J/ψp are very diﬀerent for P +

c pentaquark states to ¯D∗Λ+

This article is arranged as follows. In the next section, we present the theoretical framework

of our calculation. In Sect. 3, the numerical results and some discussions are presented.

2 Theoretical framework

Among the two observed structures, the existence of the narrow Pc(4450), no matter what it is,
is aﬃrmative from the data for the J/ψp invariant mass distribution. However, introducing the
second structure, the Pc(4380), does not seem that necessary since there is still a discrepancy
between the best ﬁt with two Pc structures and the data in the right shoulder of the peak in
the J/ψp invariant mass distribution. Yet, a recent phenomelogical analysis of the data aﬃrms

2

the necessity of introducing the Pc(4380) [21]. Here, we assume the P +
c (4380) exists with the
properties reported by the LHCb Collaboration, and study its decays to the two ﬁnal states ¯D∗Λ+
c
and J/ψp with the assumption that it is a bound state of ¯DΣ∗c (2520) (type I) or ¯D∗Σc(2455)
(type II). These two decays can proceed through triangular diagrams as shown in Fig 1. Since we
only aim at making a rough estimate, which is suﬃcient for the conclusion, we only consider the
exchange of lightest possible mesons. This means that we will consider the one-pion-exchange, as
well as the one-rho-exchange in previous work [2], between the charmed baryons and anti-charmed
mesons, and the exchange of ground state pseudoscalar and vector charmed mesons, which are
related to each other via heavy quark spin symmetry, for the decays into the J/ψp.

where P, V, B, B∗ denote pseudoscalar, vector meson, octet and decuplet baryon, respectively. The
coupling constants gDD∗π, gΣcΛcπ and gΣ∗

decay widths of the D∗, Σc and Σ∗c , respectively. The extracted values of gΣcΛcπ and gΣ∗

very well the relation predicted by heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS). The coupling constant
gD∗D∗π can be related to the value of gDD∗π by heavy quark spin symmetry. The other coupling
constants cannot be measured directly. Since we only aim at making a rough estimate of the
partical decay widths, we take model values [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] for
them which are listed in Table 1.

While for those interaction vertices including the spin-3/2 Pc(4380) state, we use the Lorentz

where Pc is the pentaquark ﬁelds with J P = 3/2−. Here we have assumed that the Pc is an
S-wave hadronic molecular state of either ¯D∗Σc or ¯DΣ∗c . When we are only interested in the ratio
between the partial widths to ¯D∗Λc and J/ψp of a given hadronic molecule structure, either ¯D∗Σc
or ¯DΣ∗c , the coupling constant gets cancelled.

Combining the Lagrangians and propagators given above together, we can easily get the decay

amplitudes for the process shown in Fig. 1, and the expressions are given in Appendix A.

The loop integrals in the amplitudes are ultraviolet (UV) divergent, which means that we need
counterterms to absorb the divergence. Here, in order to be able to make an estimate we will
neglect the counterterms and simply use a Gaussian regulator with the cutoﬀ taking values in a
large range. For the explicit form of the regulator, we take the one used in Refs. [38, 39, 40]:

ΦPc (q2

E/Λ2) ≡ exp(−q2

where qE is the Euclidean Jacobi momentum.

Figure 2: The Λ dependence of R for the cases of type I and II.

One sees that the dependence of both ratios on the cutoﬀ is rather weak. The partial decay
width of the Pc into the Λc ¯D∗ is much larger than that into the J/ψp for the type I hadronic
molecule, while the situation is diﬀerent for type II. Because the Pc structures were observed by
the LHCb Collaboration in the J/ψp invariant mass distribution, our results show that the Pc
should be copiously produced in Λc ¯D∗ and thus can be easily searched for by reconstructing events
for Λc and ¯D∗ if it is a type I hadronic molecule. Therefore, this ratio can be employed to tell
the nature of the Pc resonances in the future experiments, such as experiments at LHCb, the γp
experiments at JLab [41], or the πp experiments at JPARC [42].

It is a ﬁrm conclusion that the partial width of Pc(4380) → ¯D∗Λc for the Pc(4380) being a ¯DΣ∗c
hadronic molecule is much larger than the ¯D∗Σc hadronic molecular case. This conclusion does
not depend on any unknown coupling constant, and is analyzed in details using the nonrelativistic
formalism taking heavy quark spin symmetry into account in Appendix B.

We also ﬁnd that the ratio R is insensitive to the mass of the Pc in the range between 4.36 GeV
and 4.50 GeV which covers the locations of both LHCb Pc structures. Yet, we need to notice that
because of the mass, the Pc(4450), located 10 MeV below the ¯D∗Σc threshold, cannot be a ¯DΣ∗c
bound state.

A hadronic molecule with unstable constituents can decay naturally through the decays of its
constituents. However, the widths of Σ(∗)
are small, which leads to small three-body decay widths
for the Pc. For instance, the three-body decay Pc → ¯DπΛc shown in Fig. 3 leads to a width of
only 7.3 MeV, much smaller than the reported width of the Pc(4380). Here we evaluated the value
of the coupling gPcΣ∗

where M , m1 and m2 are the masses of Pc, ¯D( ¯D∗) and Σ∗c (Σc), respectively, and ǫ is the binding
energy, which is valid for an S-wave shallow bound state. Here we have introduced the factor
1/(4M m2) to account for the normalization of fermion ﬁelds in comparison with the formula used
in, e.g. Ref. [45]. If we take the mass of the Pc as 4.38 GeV, then gPcΣ∗
¯D = 1.3. The large value of
RI makes possible that the ¯DΣ∗c molecule decays dominantly into the ¯D∗Λc rather than the three-
body tree-level decay mode. We can make an order-of-magnitude estimate of Γ(Pc(4380) → ¯D∗Λc)
for type I hadronic molecule. Taking the cutoﬀ to be in the range between 0.7 GeV and 1.2 GeV,
which reﬂects the intrinsic model dependence because of the UV divergence of the loop integrals,
the partial width in question could be as large as O(100 MeV). The nonrelativistic formalism with
a Gaussian form factor as described in Appendix B leads to the same conclusion.
It is worthy to mention that our results also depend on the values of those coupling constants
shown in Table 1, and some of them are obtained from ﬂavor SU (4). Fortunately, as shown in
Figs. 2, the magnitude of R for type I and type II are diﬀerent by more than an order of magnitude,
hence even if these values only present a rough estimate of the real values of the coupling constants,
our main conclusion should still be valid. The large decay branching ratio of the ¯DΣ∗c molecule
to ¯D∗Λc results in a much larger decay width than that of the ¯D∗Σc molecule. Furthermore, the
nominal mass of the Pc(4380) is just a few MeV below the ¯DΣ∗c threshold. These properties makes
more plausible to explain the Pc(4380) as a ¯DΣ∗c hadronic molecule than a ¯D∗Σc one.

In summary, we have studied the decays of hidden charm pentaquark P +

c (4380) state to ¯D∗Λ+
c
and J/ψp, assuming that its quantum numbers are J P = 3/2−, under the hadronic molecular
assumption of either ¯DΣ∗c or ¯D∗Σc. The two decays can be described by means of the triangle
diagrams where the two constituents of the P +
c can exchange the pseudoscalar and vector mesons
leading to the J/ψp or ¯D∗Λ+
c ﬁnal states. We estimate the ratio of these two decay modes. The
is a ¯DΣ∗c (2520) bound
results show that its value is sensitive to the ansatz of whether the P +
c
state or a ¯D∗Σc(2455) bound state. According to our calculation, if the Pc(4380) is a ¯DΣ∗c bound
state, it would have a much larger branching ratio to the ¯D∗Λc than that to the J/ψp. And the
situation is diﬀerent if the Pc(4380) is a ¯D∗Σc bound state. As a result, the ¯DΣ∗c bound state
ansatz is more reasonable than the ¯D∗Σc one to explain the broad Pc(4380) structure. We suggest
to search for the Pc(4380) in the ¯D∗Λ+
c system, which can be used to disentangle the nature of
the P +

c (4380) structure.

B Nonrelativistic formalism

In this appendix, we will describe a nonrelativistic formalism which can be used to calculate the
one-pion-exchange loop diagrams for the decays of the ¯D∗Σc and ¯DΣ∗c into the ¯D∗Λc. The reason
is that for these two decays, all the involved particles except for the pion can be treated nonrel-
ativistically: the Pc is near the ¯D∗Σc and ¯DΣ∗c thresholds, and the center-of-mass momentum in
the ¯D∗Λc system is only 0.43 GeV for MPc = 4.38 GeV.

We will take the two-component notation for ﬁelds containing heavy quarks [46]. Then the ﬁeld
for charmed mesons is given by Ha = ~D∗a · ~σ + Da, where Da and D∗a annihilate the pseudoscalar
and vector charmed mesons, respectively, a is the light ﬂavor index, and ~σ are the Pauli matrices
acting in the spinor space. The ﬁeld for anti-charmed mesons reads ¯Ha = − ~¯D∗a · ~σ + ¯Da if we take
the phase convention for charge conjugation as (Da, D∗a) C→ ( ¯Da, ¯D∗a). The axial coupling of the

pions to the heavy mesons is contained in the following leading order chiral Lagrangian [46, 47]

when we consider three light ﬂavors, and F is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit and
we will take 92.2 MeV. The value of the coupling constant g = 0.57 can be extracted from the
measured decay width of D∗+ [48]. We can also write down the trace formalism for the sextet

can be decomposed into an S-wave part and a D-wave part which will be denoted by IS and ID,
respectively. The decomposition can be easily done by deﬁning the S-wave and D-wave projectors

It turns out that the D-wave part ID is UV convergent as discussed in Ref. [51], while the S-wave
part Is is UV divergent. The divergence might be regularized by introducing a Gaussian form

factor exp(cid:16)−(~q − ~l )2/Λ2(cid:17), which is the nonrelativistic analogue of the form factor in Eq. (10).

For the purpose of qualitatively comparing the relative size of the partial widths calculated from
the one-pion-exchange diagrams for the two hadronic molecular assignments, we do not need to
specify a value for Λ as can be seen in the following. Using Eqs. (38) and (39), we have

One sees that the partial width for the ¯DΣ∗c molecule decay into Λc ¯D∗ contains both S-wave and
D-wave components while that for the decay of the ¯D∗Σc molecule contains only ID. Notice that in
the above expressions the coeﬃcients in front of ID are almost the same. It turns out that if we take
2

the mass of the Pc to be 4.38 GeV, then for the convergent D-wave parts (cid:12)(cid:12)ID(mD, mΣ∗
is roughly one order of magnitude larger than (cid:12)(cid:12)ID(mD∗ , mΣc, mπ, ~q 2)(cid:12)(cid:12)

, which is because the
Pc(4380) nominal mass is much closer to the ¯DΣ∗c threshold than to the ¯D∗Σc one. Furthermore,
the diﬀerence between Eq. (46) and Eq. (47) could be as large as 2 orders of magnitude if we
evaluate IS(mD, mΣ∗

c , mπ, ~q 2)(cid:12)(cid:12)

c , mπ, ~q 2) with a cutoﬀ Λ ∈ [0.7, 1.2] GeV.

Therefore, it is a ﬁrm conclusion that if the Pc(4380) is a ¯DΣ∗c molecule, its partial width of

the decay into Λc ¯D∗ is much larger than that for the case if it is a ¯D∗Σc molecule.
