Ultracold bosons in a triangular lattice are a promising candidate for observing quantum spin liq-
uid behavior. Here we investigate, for such system, the role of a harmonic trap giving rise to an in-
homogeneous density. We construct a modiﬁed spin-wave theory for arbitrary ﬁlling, and predict the
breakdown of order for certain values of the lattice anisotropy. These regimes, identiﬁed with the spin
liquid phases, are found to be quite robust upon changes in the ﬁlling factor. This result is backed by
an exact diagonalization study on a small lattice.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are at the center of in-
terest of contemporary condensed matter physics and
quantum many body theory (cf. [1]) for several reasons.
P. W. Anderson proposed them as a new kind of insula-
tor: a resonating valence bond (RVB) state [2]. The in-
terest in these state was clearly stimulated by the fact
that they were soon associated with high Tc supercon-
ductivity [3]. Immediately it was realized that RVB spin
liquids might exhibit topological order [4] and are re-
lated to fractional quantum Hall states [5] and chiral spin
states [6].

(AFM)

Frustrated

anti-ferromagnets

provide
paradigm playground for RVB states and spin liquids
(for the early reviews see [7–9]). The most prominent
example is Heisenberg spin 1/2 model in a kagome
lattice. Unfortunately, they are notoriously diﬃcult
for numerical simulations, since due to the (in)famous
sign problem quantum Monte Carlo methods cannot be
applied. Still, a lot of information can be extracted from
exact diagonalization studies (for seminal early studies
see Ref. [10]). There was a lot of eﬀort to describe QSLs
with various approximate analytic approaches, such as
large N expansion [11], or appropriate mean ﬁeld theory
[12, 13]. These studies suggested that QSLs described
by RVB states represent topologically ordered states
with ﬁnite energy gap, analogous to those of the famous
Kitaev’s Toric Code model [14].

In parallel to AFM in kagome lattice, the so called
dimer model in triangular lattice was studied intensively
[15] – it was also found that it is expected to exhibit a
gapped RVB phase (see also [16, 17]).

∗ alessio.celi@icfo.es

The ﬁrst experimental indications of QSLs comes from
studies of Mott insulator in the triangular lattices [18],
and power law conductivity inside the Mott gap in cer-
tain materials [19]. More recently observations (cf. [20–
22]) combine various standard and non-conventional de-
tection methods in kagome Heisenberg AFM, including
measurements of fractionalized excitations [21]. There
are also reports of QSL behavior in the, so called, Her-
bertsmithites (cf. [23]).

Recently great progress was achieved in numerical
simulations of the gapped QSLs, based on the the use 1D
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) codes,
“wired” on 2D tori/cylinders. This approach allowed for
better insight into the properties of the ground state of
the Heisenberg AFM in the kagome lattice [24, 25]. More
importantly, it allowed obtaining convincing signature
of its topological Z2 nature . This was based on numerical
estimate for the, so called, topological entanglement en-
tropy (TEE) – the quantity that unambiguously charac-
terizes topological gapped QSLs [26, 27]. Calculations of
TEE were earlier applied to the quantum dimer model in
the triangular lattice [28] and to the Bose-Hubbard spin
liquid in the kagome lattice [29]. They were extended to
critical QSLs [30], Toric Code [31] and lattice Laughlin
states [32]. Since these calculations aim at sub-leading
term in entanglement entropy, it is quite challenging to
achieve good accuracy (see for instance [31, 33].

Recently, studies of AFM in kagome lattice were ex-
tended to novel proposals for characterizing/detecting
topological excitations and dynamical structure factor
[34]. Several papers discuss inclusion of the chiral terms
and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions, resulting in for-
mation of chiral QSLs [35, 36]. Considerable interest
was devoted also to the J1 − J2 Heisenberg model in the
kagome lattice [37] and in the square lattice [38], to the
J1−J2−J3 Heisenberg model in the kagome lattice [39, 40]
, and to the Kitaev-Heisenberg model [41, 42] in triangu-
lar lattices [43, 44].

Systems of ultracold atoms and ions provide a very
versatile playground for quantum simulation of various
models of theoretical many body physics [45, 46] – QSL
have in this context also quite long history. The ﬁrst pro-
posals for quantum simulators of the Kitaev model in
the hexagonal lattice [47], and AFM in the kagome lat-
tice [48–50] were formulated more than ten years ago; all
of them were based on smart designs and use of super-
exchange interactions in optical lattices. More feasible
and perhaps are experimentally less demanding pro-
posals based on ultracold ions [51], or ultracold atoms
in shaken optical lattice [52]. The latter schemes were
originally designed to control the value and sign of the
tunneling in Bose-Hubbard models – for original theory
proposal see [53], and for the ﬁrst experiments in the
square lattice see [54]. They should be regarded as spe-
ciﬁc examples of generation of synthetic gauge ﬁelds in
optical lattices [46, 55], or more precisely synthetic gauge
ﬁelds in periodically-driven quantum systems [56].

We should stress that the proposal of Ref.

[52] is
in principle very promising, since it requires tempera-
ture of order of (t/U)U (cid:39) t which is achievable in re-
alistic experimental conditions, here U denotes atom-
atom on site interaction energy.
In fact, initial experi-
ment demonstrated feasibility of the scheme, but were
conducted far from hardcore boson limit.
In these
experiments a triangular array of cigar shaped Bose-
Einstein condensates was realized, corresponding to a
frustrated quasi-classical AFM [60], described by a clas-
sical XX spin model with the U(1) symmetry, and Gaus-
sian Bogoliubov-de Gennes quantum, or better to say
quasi-classical ﬂuctuations. In the further works, by ex-
ploiting control over the temporal shape of the periodic

Change of sign of tunneling in the triangular lattice is
know to be equivalent of the introduction of the π-ﬂux
synthetic “magnetic” ﬁeld in the Bose-Hubbard model
[5, 52].
In the hardcore boson limit one obtains then
an XX AFM model in the triangular lattice, which for
isotropic bonds is known to have a planar Néel ground
state. If, however, the bonds are anisotropic and their
values t1, t2 = t3 = t t1 can be controlled, then as
anisotropic parameter t goes from inﬁnity to zero the
model interpolates between an AFM in a rhombic lattice
(with the conventional Néel ground state) to an AFM in
the ideal triangular lattice (with the planar Néel ground
state), and ﬁnally to an AFM in an array of weakly cou-
pled 1D chains (with the conventional Néel ground state
again). Exact diagonalizations and tensor network states
simulations (PEPS) indicate that between these three
Néel phases there exists two quite extended regions of
gapped QSL [51].

Interestingly the presence and the location of the QSL
phases can be determined quite accurately using the gen-
eralized spin wave theory, which signals instability at the
QSL boundaries [51, 57]. The spin wave method is im-
pressively powerful and has been generalized and ap-
plied to frustrated bosons and Heisenberg model with
completely asymmetric triangular lattice [58, 59].

modulation, one could realize arbitrary Peierl’s phases,
i.e. arbitrary ﬂuxes of the synthetic “magnetic” ﬁeld
through the elementary plaquette of the lattice ([61], see
also [62]). This allowed for realization of a quasi-classical
spin model with competing U(1) and Ising Z2 symme-
tries [63]. The route toward the strongly correlated
regime and hardcore limit seem to be obscured, how-
ever, by uncontrolled heating mechanisms, most proba-
bly intrinsically associated with the periodic modulation
scheme [56].

Even if this diﬃculty is overcome, another experimen-
tal aspect might prevent the observation of QSL in such
systems.
Indeed the overall harmonic trapping of the
atomic ensemble leads to non-constant ﬁlling factor over
the optical lattice. We should expect thus formation of
wedding cake structure, formed by the diﬀerent quan-
tum phases (cf. [46] and references therein). How does
the phase diagram look like or change in the presence
of such “experimental imperfections”? This is the ques-
tion we want to answer in this paper. To this aim we
apply exact diagonalization on small lattices , and wired
DMRG with open boundary conditions. On large lattices
we apply modiﬁed spin-wave theory, adopted to the spa-
tially inhomogeneous situation, which turns out to be
technically much more demanding than the one pertain-
ing to the spatially homogeneous lattice. Our work pro-
vides a starting point for the future applications of ten-
sor network state approaches like Projected Entangled
Pair States (PEPS) to a moderate size lattices. These fu-
ture calculations will aim at estimations of topological
entropy, which so far for the considered model in the
triangular lattice has not yet been accomplished even in
the spatially homogeneous case with periodic boundary
conditions. Studying the inﬂuence of the spatial inho-
mogeneities, induced by the presence of the trap or dis-
order, on topological entanglement entropy is a fascinat-
ing question in itself – it goes, however, beyond the scope
of the present paper. While inhomogeneity due to con-
ﬁnement are instrinsict to ultracold atoms, our approach
may be also relevant for searching QSLs in other quasi-
2D condensed matter systems that present residual mag-
netization or inhomogeneities, for instance, due to the
presence of a substrate.

The paper is structured in the following way: Af-
ter introducing the system and model in Section II, we
construct the modiﬁed spin wave theory in Section III.
From this theory, we obtain a phase diagram in Sec-
tion IV. In Section V, we consider ﬁrst a small lattice us-
ing exact diagonalization. Then, we show that quasi-
exact results can be obtained for much larger lattices us-
ing DMRG. The main conclusion drawn from our study,
summarized in Section VI, regards the co-existence of
spin liquid behavior at diﬀerent ﬁlling factors smaller
than 1/2. Thus, the spin liquid phase is expected to be
robust against inhomogeneities due to a trapping poten-
tial. Our ﬁnding should facilitate the experimental ob-
servation of spin liquids in optical lattice systems.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE ATOMIC MODEL AND MAP

TO THE SPIN MODEL

Ultracold bosons in deep optical lattices are very well
described by the Bose-Hubbard model. Therefore, we
will take the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian as a starting
point for our analysis:

Here, the ˆb†
i , ˆbi are the creation and annihilation oper-
ator at the site i of the triangular lattice, and ˆni = ˆb†
ˆbi
is the number operator of the Fock space. The ﬁrst
term is a possibly anisotropic nearest-neighbor hopping,
with tunneling amplitudes ti j. In the standard case, one
would have a minus sign in front of the tunneling term.
However, it is possible to control the sign (or even phase)
of the tunneling, which is a crucial ingredient to gen-
erate frustration in the triangular lattice. As here we
will exclusively be interested in such scenario of reversed
hopping amplitude, we absorbed the sign in the deﬁ-
nition of ti j, such that standard hopping would corre-
spond to ti j < 0, while we will consider ti j > 0. The sec-
ond term in H describes repulsive on-site interactions of
strength U > 0. The last term is the trapping potential
2 mω2. Although it is present in any
Vi = Vr2
realistic experiment, it is often neglected in theoretical
studies. The positions of a boson on site i is denoted by
ri.

i − µ0, V = 1

If interactions U are strongly repulsive, ﬂuctuations in
particle number is suppressed. It is then justiﬁed to re-
strict the local Hilbert space to a subspace formed by the
states with occupation number two. These states may
change throughout the trap, but within a local density
approximation, we may keep them ﬁxed within a circu-
lar area in the center of the trap, and ring-shaped areas
further outside, as illustrated in Figure 1. Each region is
denoted by an integer I, according to the possible occu-
pation within the region, nI = {I − 1, I}.
This approach allows to map the Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian onto a spin model, using a Holstein-
Primakoﬀ transformation [64]. Within each region I, the
transformation is deﬁned as

between the radii rI and rI−1, deﬁned as the distances where
the average occupation takes two consecutive integer values,
(cid:104)ˆnrI(cid:105) = I, (cid:104)ˆnrI−1(cid:105) = I − 1. The hight of the plateau is taken to be
the one corresponding to half ﬁlling. The smooth terms can be
then treated as a perturbation, on the same footing as the hop-
ping term. The eﬀective model in each plateau is thus equiva-
lent to an anisotropic XX-spin model with an smoothly varying
magnetic term.

Before studying this Hamiltonian in the next sections
using modiﬁed spin wave theory, exact diagonalization,
and DMRG, let us brieﬂy discuss the parameter regimes
which are of interest experimentally. As mentioned be-
fore, being interested in frustration and spin liquids, the
spin-spin interactions in Eq. (3) should be antiferromag-
netic, that is, ti j > 0. To simplify the scenario, ti j should
only depend on the direction of the hopping, with am-
plitudes along horizontal links denoted t1, while the two
links with non-zero vertical component shall have an
amplitude t2 = t t1, see Figure 2. The anisotropy of the lat-
tice is then characterized by a single parameter t, which
we will tune from 0, corresponding to an eﬀective 1D
system, to values greater than 2, where the lattice ge-
ometry is dominated by a rhombic structure. The en-
ergy diﬀerence between neighboring spins is of the or-
der ∆Vi = Va2 ≡ η t1, where a is the lattice constant, and
η is a dimensionless parameter. We Assume the lattice
is loaded with 87Rb atoms, which has lattice constant
a = 553 nm and a trap frequency ω = 2π × 40Hz; we
have ∆Vi/ = 15Hz. This is about an order of magnitude
weaker than typical interactions strengths, t1/ ≈ 150Hz.
In the modiﬁed spin wave approach, we will therefore

4

say that corrected choice for the quantization axis is the
same as at half ﬁlling.

What is then the diﬀerence with respect to the half-
ﬁlling case? The diﬀerence resides in the magnitude of
the spin projection. If we do the reasonable assumption
that the ﬂuctuations are proportional to such length we
can relate n, the local density of bosonic excitations, to
the ﬁlling. As originally proposed by Takahashi [66],
such density at half ﬁlling should be taken equal to the
total spin, n = S , that to say also the bosonic excitations
are at half-ﬁlling. Here, we propose a generalized Taka-
hashi condition,

n = S| sin ρ|,

S

√

(5)
where the angle ρ is related to the ﬁlling by the relation
(cid:104)S z(cid:105) = ν−S = S cos ρ which implies | sin ρ| = 1
ν(2S − ν).
This choice has further physical justiﬁcation. First, it is
symmetric around half ﬁlling as it should be: reversing
the quantization axis ˆz in the Dyson-Maleev transforma-
tion [67–69] is equivalent to the replacement ν → 2S − ν.
Second, ﬂuctuations are maximal at half-ﬁlling and are
suppressed in the paramagnetic (Mott) phases, which
correspond to ﬁlling ν = 0 and 2S .

As derived in previous sections, the ﬁlling factor ν is
smoothly changing in the trap and relates to the har-
monic potential as ν = [ µ

III. MODIFIED SPIN-WAVE THEORY

Let us start by analyzing the spin system for constant
non-zero magnetization, which corresponds to ﬁllings
2. Classically, we expect the spin oriented
diﬀerent from 1
along a cone around the z-axis,

Si = (sin ρ cos(Q · ri), sin ρ cos(Q · ri), cos ρ).

(4)
Here, Q = (Qx, Qy) is a vector in the xy-plane while
ρ is the azimuthal angle related to the magnetization
along the z-axis, i.e. to the ﬁlling of the original bosons
ν = (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) − [(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105)], where [x] = integer part of x. For ρ = π
2,
(4) reduces to the ansatz considered by [57, 65] at half
ﬁlling. If we follow the standard spin-wave approach,
we should choose the local basis in such a way that the
new local z-axis is parallel to the vector (4). In this way,
by applying the bosonization of the local spin we would
model ﬂuctuations along the classical ordering represented
by (4). Now, such ﬂuctuations would have component
also along the z-axis. In other words, they would renor-
malize the ﬁlling factor. Such behavior is not acceptable
from the physical point of view.
Indeed, in the origi-
nal bosonic Hubbard model the ﬁlling factor is a well
deﬁned quantity: the hopping term conserves the par-
ticle number, and, thus, the expectation value of the par-
ticle density which is the ﬁlling. The same argument
holds for the same physical model as described as a spin
system. In practice, the acceptable ﬂuctuations are re-
stricted to the xy-plane, and, precisely, are along the pro-
jection of the ordering vector on the xy-plane. That is to

Note that this expression does not coincide with
[57][Eq. 5]: indeed, the odd terms in sin θi j are absent
there as they have zero expectation value on a thermal
gas of excitations. It is worth noticing that the terms in
cos θi j and sin θi j are manifestly symmetric and antisym-
metric under the exchange of indices, i ↔ j, respectively.
Indeed, by construction the whole expression is invari-
ant under such exchange of summed indices. Further-
more, the Hamiltonian (9) can be rewritten in an explicit
translational invariant fashion by noticing that the sum
over the links can be performed as a sum over there links
coming out of a site, and then summing over all the sites.
As these three lattice vectors on a triangular lattice we
choose τ1 = (1, 0), τ2 = 1
3). As H
in Eq.
(9) is non-Hermitian, following Takahashi [66],
we use it in order to construct a free Energy for a gas of

tional form of the entropy it follows that wk is also the
rate at which the entropy changes with changing occu-
pation, i.e. wk = T ∂S

Thus, one is getting the same result as for diagonaliza-

when the expectation value E is real, but not otherwise.

The following physical considerations are in order. In
the zero temperature limit we are interested in, the gas
of Bogoliubov excitations is expected to condense. Such
condensation is consistent with the spin ordering only if
the zero mode condenses, as such condensation translate
into inﬁnite range correlation in the original atomic sys-
tem. The requirement of zero mode to become macro-
νk ∼
Nn, implies that wk=0 → 0, which also corresponds to
|θk=0| → ∞. Thus, this condition can be realized only for
Bk=0 ∼ Ak=0, which implies that in the phase we are in-
terested in, the chemical potential has to be set to zero,

scopically occupied at low temperature, M0 =(cid:82)

|k|<

µ = 0. Note that this also means the occupation of each
mode νk is much smaller than 1
2). Thus,
2 ∼ 1
by singling out the the zero mode and using νk + 1

in the expression for correlation functions, they become

(27)

After having singled out the zero mode and con-
strained the occupation the function Ak and Bk should
be redeﬁned in form accordingly. In fact only Bk gets
redeﬁned. Indeed, by recalculating the consistency con-
dition for an extremum of the F for the new deﬁnition of
the correlation functions –that to say taking into account
the dependence of M0 on νk and θk, as well as µ = 0– we

It is easy to check that the classical order is recov-

minimum of the free energy is just determined by the
minimum of C: the Q-order found is the classical re-
sult, QCl = (2 arccos(−t/2), 0), which corresponds to
(c1, c2, c3) = ( t2−2

corresponds to the linear spin wave (LSW) calculation,

in particular wk=0 = 0 as expected. It is easy to check that,
for the classical order QCl, wk is always real and that is by
construction an extreme. In fact, as it can be checked nu-
merically that it is also the minimal energy solution also

rections and is known as modiﬁed spin wave (MSW) ap-

As in [57], we will search for solutions recursively, start-
ing from the ordinary spin wave solution above. The ab-
sence of a pronounced minimal value will signal the ex-
istence of possible spin-liquid phase. In order to ﬁnd the
optimal Q = (Qx, Qy), we have to impose that the gradi-

IV. RESULT FROM THE MODIFIED SPIN WAVE

ANALYSIS

In the previous section, we have derived a modiﬁed
spin wave theory for the XX spin model on a triangu-
lar lattice. We will now extract concrete results from this
theoretical framework. This amounts for a minimization
problem of the free energy, which is complicated due to
the large amount of variables. Using the procedure de-
scribed in the subsection below, we manage to perform
minimization even for large lattices with hundreds of

sites. As the result, we then obtain the phase diagram
for a realistic experimental system as a function of the
hopping anisotropy t.

A. Optimization and stability

In search for a long-range order in the quartic case, we
adopt an iterative procedure. We start from the ordinary
spin-wave (33) solution with Q = QCl as initial conﬁgu-
ration. The recursive procedure works as follows. First,
the values of Ak, Bk at the cycle m are used to get the
new correlation functions Fµ, Gµ, using Eq. (26). Once
the correlations are substituted in the free energy, which
at zero temperature reduces to the expectation value of
the energy (17), the latter becomes a function of the or-
dering vector Q only, E = E(Q). The new value at the cy-
cle m of Q is, thus, determined by minimizing the E(Q)
in the neighborhood of optimal value of Q at the cycle
m. Finally, (31) and (32) are used to update Ak and Bk as
a function of the correlation functions and of the order
vector. Convergence of the iterative process is assumed
when the diﬀerence between the old and the updated
values of Ak and Bk are below a certain threshold.

We have benchmarked the performance of this itera-
tive approach against brute force minimization of the en-
ergy as function of the free parameters θk and Q for dif-
ferent shapes and sizes of lattices with periodic bound-
ary conditions. While the success and eﬃciency of the it-
erative approach, i.e. the number of iterations needed for
achieving convergence, strongly depends on the shape of
the lattice, it performs generally better than a brute force
minimization and the scalability with the lattice size is
pretty good. Best performance is achieved for rhombic
lattices, see Figure 3. Converge or failure occurs after
few tens of iterations. The latter manifests when |Ak| be-
comes greater than |Bk| for some k, which corresponds
to wk becoming imaginary. In fact, more than a real in-
stability, the absence of convergence signals that the ap-
proximation we have used of neglecting the occupation
νk of the modes k (cid:44) 0 is not respected. That is to say, the
physical assumption of the existence of an ordered phase
behind the spin-wave analysis is not veriﬁed. The com-
parison between the iterative approach and the brute
force minimization of the free energy, which we have
performed without assuming νk (cid:28) 1 on L × L rhombic
lattices with L up to 10, conﬁrmed this scenario.
Next we have extended our iterative minimization to
larger lattices. We have ﬁrst studied the half-ﬁlling case
for L = 24, 100 and for the inﬁnite L limit, obtained by
replacing the sum over k with an (numeric) integral over
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.

B. Phase diagram predicted by spin wave at half-ﬁlling

We have ﬁrst started by studying the half ﬁlling case,
2. Our results are very close to the one of [57] and

ρ = π

tion of the ﬁlling within the MSW approach. The two ordered

set: a 6 × 6 lattice of rhombic shape with periodic boundary
conditions.

display the same qualitative behavior (see Figure 3). In
particular, we observe a failure of convergence around
t ∼ 0 and for t between 1.55 − 1.8. The ﬁrst region
in the limit t → 0 the system re-
is easily explained:
duces to disconnected 1D-XX chains that can order sep-
arately in 1D-Néel orders with arbitrary relative phases.
Thus, there is a huge degeneracy in the groundstate that
should correspond to a gapless spin-liquid phase. The
region around t ∼ 1.65 appears at the interface between
two classically ordered phases, the spiral order and a
2D-Néel order, which appear at lower and higher val-
ues of t, respectively. Both phases are well described by
the classical order ansatz we used. It is worth noticing
that the initial condition and the reﬂection symmetry of
the Hamiltonian around the x-axis implies that our solu-
tion is respecting such symmetry i.e. the ordering vector
remains parallel to the x-axis and the correlation func-
tions respect the relations F2 = F(τ2) = F(τ3) = F3,
G2 = G(τ2) = G(τ3) = G3. This implies that we can
work at ﬁxed Qy = 0. For this choice, the 2D-Néel or-
der corresponds to Qx = 2π, while the spiral order cor-
responds to Qx smoothly interpolating between 2π and
π for decreasing values of the anisotropy t. While at
the classical level, the 2D-Néel order is predicted to be
stable for t ≥ 2, the quantum corrections incorporated
by MSW approach stabilize it also for lower values of
t, as displayed in Figure 4. Similar results are obtained
by exact diagonalization, see Figure 13(a). By reduc-
ing further the values of t the system enters in a non-
ordered phase signaled by the absence of points from
MSW. While in the neighboring regions above and below
the no-convergence window the occupancy of the zero-
momentum states remains large, see Figure 5, the values
of the relative susceptibility ρxx is small in the vicinity of
such window, Figure 6. Similarly to [57], we estimate the
susceptibility by calculating the Hessian of the energy
for ﬁxed correlation functions at the minimum. In order
to get an adimensional quantity we divide by the abso-
lute value of the energy minimum, thus, ρxx = 1

Figure 6.
(Color online) Values of the rescaled susceptibil-
ity ρxx and ρyy: comparison of results from LSW and from

convergence window ρxx is small, signaling instability of the
order. Around the non-convergence window ρyy is large as ex-
pected because the y-component of the order vector Qy is the
same for spiral and 2D-Néel order. Instead, ρyy signals the in-
stability that leads to 1D-Néel order for t ∼ 0.

tor Qx displays a moderate dependence on n only close
to the non-convergence window, Figure 7. In fact, the
non-convergence window changes: while it remains cen-
tered around t ∼ 1.65, its extension shrinks smoothly
while n decreases. Indications of such behavior can be
detected both in the condensate fraction and in the sus-
ceptibility. Indeed, the shrinking of the non-convergence
window is well evident in Figure 8(a) where the occupa-
tion of the zero mode M0 is depicted. As expected M0
is directly proportional to n, that is to say the conden-
sate fraction M0
n depicted in Figure 8(b) is independent
of n. This behavior supports the picture that the nature
of the ordered phases is unchanged while their stability
increase by moving away from half ﬁlling n = 1
2. Further
conﬁrmation comes from the calculation of the relative
susceptibilities ρxx and ρyy. While ρyy does not display
a strong dependence on n, Figure 10, ρxx displays a siz-
able dependence on n only around the non-convergence
window. In particular, ρxx weakly increases when n de-
creases, showing that the ordered phase gets smoothly
more stable, Figure 9. Thus, we conclude that by mov-
ing out of half-ﬁlling the conjectured spin-liquid phase
signaled by the non-convergence window of MSW does
not disappear but shrinks rather gently.

V. EXACT DIAGONALIZATION STUDY

i S z

In this section we will study the Hamiltonian (3) by
(cid:80)
means of exact diagonalization. Therefore, we ﬁrst note
that it conserves the z-component of total spin, S z ≡
i. This symmetry reﬂects conservation of parti-
1
N
cles, and allows to work in Hilbert space blocks with
ﬁxed spin polarization. Using this symmetry, we are able
to exactly diagonalize systems of 24 sites, as depicted
in Figure 2. As in the spin-wave analysis, we will ﬁrst
consider the system within a local density approxima-

pected ρyy is not signaling any instability for 1.5 ≤ t ≤ 2
–the optimal Qy is identical for the spiral and 2D-Néel
order– while it detects the instability at t ∼ 0, see Figure
6. While for all the observables represented in Figure 4-
6 the MSW results deviate considerably from the ones
predicted by the LSW, they are quickly converging to a
stable behavior for moderate size-lattices – for a rhombic
shape lattice L × L the deviation between L = 24 and the
continuous limit are tiny.

Then, we have considered lower values of ρ between
2, corresponding to lower densities of Bogoliubov
0 and π
ν(1 − ν), where ν is the ﬁll-
excitations n = 1
ing. We have considered the same observables as in the
half-ﬁlling case. We have found again that the results
quickly saturate to a stable value for growing size of
the lattices. For simplicity, we present here the results
L × L rhombic-shaped lattices with periodic boundary
conditions for L = 100. First, we notice that the values
of the optimal order vector Q remains substantially un-
changed with respect to the half-ﬁlling case. While by
construction Qy = 0, the x-component of the order vec-

the peak position hardly depends on the spin polariza-
tion for most values of t, except for a small region around
t ≈ 1.5, where dQx/dt tends to inﬁnity. This means that a
trapped system, composed of subsystems with diﬀerent
S z, should exhibit a similar structure factor as the homo-
geneous system, except for a possible broadening of the
peak near t ≈ 1.5. For S z = 0, the two limiting cases
Q = π ˆx and Q = 2π ˆx, reached for t = 0 and t > 1.5, corre-
spond to an intrachain Néel order, and to a square-lattice
Néel order, respectively.

In Figure 11(b), we show the order parameter M0 ob-
tained from the structure factor in diﬀerent polarization
sectors. In contrast to Qx, the diﬀerent curves of M0 do
not overlap, although again many qualitative properties
are shared between diﬀerent polarization sectors: For all
S z, the curve of M0 as a function of t can roughly be de-
scribed in the following way: For t (cid:46) 0.5, the curves
are ﬂat at a low value of M0. The value of M0 then
quickly increases, before the curves become ﬂat again for
0.75 (cid:46) t (cid:46) 1.25. The curves then exhibit a dip or a kink
around t ≈ 1.5, before they increase again.

The occurrence of a quantum spin liquid phase, as a
breakdown of the ordered phases, should be reﬂected
by small values of M0. The dip at t ≈ 1.5 can therefore
be taken as a signal for spin liquid behavior. For larger
systems, such signal is also found near t ≈ 0.5, as shown
in Ref. [57] for S z = 0 in a 20×20 lattice studied via PEPS.
Useful information about the phase of the system is
contained also in the entanglement spectrum, obtained
from the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ρL ≡
TrR|Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ|. Here, TrR denotes a trace over half spins, lo-
calized on the right side of the lattice. The entanglement
spectrum is then deﬁned as λi = − log ρi, where ρi denote
the eigenvalues of ρL.

In Figure 12 we plot the eight lowest values of the
entanglement spectrum in a homogeneous system as a
function of the anisotropy t for diﬀerent spin polariza-
tions. Some qualitative features, observed in the behav-
ior of the order parameter M0, are reﬂected by the en-
tanglement spectrum: all eigenvalues remain ﬂat in the
regime 0 < t (cid:46) 0.5. The curves are also relatively ﬂat for
intermediate values 0.75 (cid:46) t (cid:46) 1.4. In contrast to these
ﬂat regimes, the curves exhibit quick or even sudden
changes in the regimes 0.5 (cid:46) t (cid:46) 0.75 and 1.4 (cid:46) t (cid:46) 1.7:
for S z = 0, the fourfold quasidegeneracy of the lowest
level is abruptly lifted at t ≈ 0.5. This sudden change
in the entanglement entropy indicates a second-order
phase transition. For t ≈ 1.8, the ground state level at
S z = 0 exhibits a crossing, accompanied by highly non-
monotonous behavior in all levels. For S z = 1, the sev-
eral levels exhibit pronounced dips around t ≈ 0.69 and
t ≈ 1.5, without aﬀecting the two-fold degeneracy of the
ground state level. For S z = 2 and S z = 3, we observe
avoided crossings of the ground state level near t ≈ 0.75.
Sudden changes of all eigenvalues occur at t ≈ 1.5 in the
S z = 3 sector.

In summary, the behavior of the entanglement spec-
trum suggests that, independently from the spin polar-

tion, assuming homogeneity within shells of diﬀerent
S z. Our exact diagonalization study is exptected to cap-
ture the system behavior in the center of the trap, and
we set Vi = 0. Afterwards, we study eﬀects of the trap-
ping potential on small scales, diagonalizing Eq. (3) at ﬁ-
nite Vi. The exact diagonalization study presented here
covers the case at half ﬁlling (S z = 0) known from Ref.
[51, 57], with a possible quantum spin liquid for t ≈ 0.5
and t ≈ 1.5. We extend this study to other polarization
sectors, which become relevant if the trap leads to an in-
creased density in the center.

Of course, in a real experiment the central area would
be surrounded by rings with decreasing density, while
the exact diagonalization study considers a scenario
with hard walls. We will therefore, in Section V C, use
DMRG methods to demonstrate that the hard wall as-
sumption becomes reasonable for suﬃciently steep trap-
ping potentials and/or low densities.

A. Homogeneous system (Vi = 0)

As an experimentally accessible quantity which allows
to chararacterize the order of the system, we have calcu-
lated the structure factor S (q):

Here (cid:104)·(cid:105) denotes the quantum average of the ground
state. The existence of a pronounced peak signals an or-
dered phase, and the momentum space position Q of the
peak further characterizes this order. As an order pa-
rameter M0 we deﬁne

M0 =

S (Q)/N.

If we don’t restrict ourselves to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
(having a hexagonal geometry), we can, at all ﬁllings and
for all anisotropies, ﬁnd a global maximum of the struc-
ture factor for Qy = 0. In Figure 11(a), we have plotted
the corresponding x-component of Q, and M0 as a func-
tion of t in diﬀerent polarization sectors. Remarkably,

Inhomogeneous system (Vi (cid:44) 0)

In the previous paragraph, we have shown that the
system, to some extent, behaves similarly in diﬀerent po-
larization sectors upon tuning the anisotropy t. This al-
lows one to argue that the same behavior should persist
in a shallow trap, where the system is approximated by
homogeneous subsystems of diﬀerent polarizations. In
the present paragraph, we go a step further, and ana-
lyze the eﬀect of a trap on short scales by diagonalizing
i , with η = 0.1 (in
Hamiltonian (3) for Vi = m
units t1/a2) for typical trapping frequencies of 40 Hz. We
will focus on the S z = 0 sector, corresponding to half ﬁll-
ing.

On the small lattice studied here, the inhomogeneities
introduced by the trap, are rather weak: For the isotropic
system, t = 1, we ﬁnd an average population of 0.46
atoms on the 14 sites at the edge of the lattice, while the
remaining 10 sites have an average population of 0.56
atoms. Accordingly, also the structure factor is barely
modiﬁed: as shown in Figure 13(a), the peak position Qx
is practically indistinguishable for the two cases η = 0
and η = 0.1. Also the order parameter M0, shown in
Figure 13(b), exhibits a similar shape, though slightly
smoothened near t = 1.5. Also the entanglement spec-
trum, plotted in Figure 14, shares important qualitative
features with the one of the homogeneous system shown
in Figure 12(a): For small values of t the ground state
level has a perfect twofold degeneracy, and a fourfold
quasidegeneracy. Again, the lifting of the degeneracy
occurs abruptly near t ≈ 0.5, although the precise value
of the anisotropy is slightly increased by the trap. On
the other hand, the level crossing observed in the homo-
geneous case around t ≈ 1.5 does not take place in the
trapped scenario.

Finally, we turn our attention to the excitation spectra.
For selected t, we compare the spectra of the trapped and
the homogeneous system in diﬀerent polarization sec-
tors in Figure 15(a–d). For the homogeneous case, a cru-
cial feature of these spectra has been noticed in Ref. [57]:
Taking into account all polarization sectors, the level
spacings are much more homogeneous around t ≈ 0.6

and t ≈ 1.4, than in other regimes where, in each spin
sector, one (or few) strongly states are separated from
higher states by a large gap. While in a ﬁnite system the
ground state energy is diﬀerent in diﬀerent polarization
sectors, one expects that in the thermodynamic limit all
ground states collapse to a degenerate manifold which
is separated from excited states by a gap. This mani-
fold is the basis of a “tower of states” [70], from which,
by breaking of the U(1) symmetry, Néel ordered phases
can arise. On the other hand, for the more homogeneous
spectra around t ≈ 0.6 and t ≈ 1.4, we do not expect this
mechanism to work. Therefore, these spectra are rather
characteristic of a spin liquid phase than of an ordered
phase.

To quantify this diﬀerent behavior we shall look at the
gap averaged over all polarization sectors. Since there
might be quasi-degenerate levels, it is not always obvi-
ous which of the levels shall be taken as ground states,
and which as excited states. For this reason, we associate

the largest level spacing smax(S z) within the ten lowest
states as the energy gap. For a system with a ”tower of
states”, that is with a gapped ground state manifold in all
polarization sectors, this quantity should remain large
when averaged over all polarizations. This average is
shown in Figure 15(e), for both a trapped and a homoge-
neous system. In both cases, it exhibits two clear minima
near t ≈ 0.6 and t ≈ 1.4. This indicates a breakdown of
order around these minima, suggesting the emergence
of spin liquid behavior.

Increasing lattice size: DMRG results

We ﬁnally present ﬁrst results from the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) [71] method, which al-
lows us to study moderately larger two-dimensional sys-
tems than is accessible via exact diagonalization [72].
Brieﬂy, DMRG is a variational method that adaptively se-
lects the most relevant subspace of the full Hilbert space,
relative to a series of bi-partitions. This proves extremely
eﬀective for large one-dimensional systems, where the
so-called ‘area law’ for entanglement entropy indicates
that ground states of gapped systems have bounded en-
tanglement entropy and can be represented faithfully in
DMRG calculations. In higher-dimensional systems, the
method can still be applied to take advantage of the area
law, where in 2D systems the cost of an accurate simu-
lation grows exponentially in the system’s width, rather
than its volume.

Starting with the Hamiltonian above for the trapped
systems, we begin by investigate ﬁnite-size eﬀects in-
troduces by exact-diagonalization on small systems. In
Fig. 16, we show results for a trapped system of seven
atoms with t = 5 and η = 2.5. Under these conditions, the
harmonic trap conﬁnes the great majority of the atoms

to the central regions studied by exact diagonalization;
for weaker trapping parameters or greater number of
atoms one would expect greater eﬀects from the hard-
wall boundary imposed by simulations of smaller sys-
tems.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this paper we have studied the fate of QSL phases in
realistic experimental conditions, namely, in presence of
an harmonic conﬁnement. The modiﬁed spin wave the-
ory, which was previously formulated for bosons in a tri-
angular lattice at half ﬁlling, was re-derived for arbitrary
ﬁlling factors. With this generalization, it can be used
to capture, within a local density approximation, the
physics of inhomogeneous systems. We have shown that
the prediction of spin liquid behavior for an anisotropy
t ≈ 1.65 does not depend much on the ﬁlling factor, and
should therefore survive in a trapped gas. This expecta-
tion was backed by results from exact diagonalization in
lattices of 24 sites. These results support the existence of
another QSL region at lower anisotropy, t ≈ 0.6, which
is not detected by MSW. Such discrepancy is not surpris-
ing. It is reasonable to expect that the MSW is able to
detect a QSL phase only between two classical ordered
phases –the QSL phase at t ≈ 1.65 appears between spi-
ral and 2D-Néel phases– while it is blind to transitions
that are purely quantum. One may wonder that this hap-
pens only because the optimization is done starting by
the classical solution.
In fact unbiased direct searches
of global minima provided the same or more energetic
metastable solutions. Apparently, the optimal solution
of the MSW is always a deformation of the classical one:
perhaps, this is not so surprising because the spin wave
approach is an expansion in n

included in the MSW are corrections to the terms con-
sidered in the LSW. The exact diagonalization approach
allowed us also to go beyond the local density approx-
imation, and to study inhomogeneities on small scales.
On this level, we have found no essential eﬀect due to
the trap for realistic choices of the trapping frequency.
While the ﬁnite-size corrections are certainly expected to
aﬀect the exact diagonalization results, they should not
exceed the 10-20 %. As the observables computed are
global one would argue that the QSL behavior extends
at least to entire lattice (of 24 spins) considered. While
ﬁnal-size eﬀects are not directly visible in the MSW be-
cause we used periodic boundary conditions, they enter
by determining the quality of local density approxima-
tion. Until the trap is not steep, and at the center is never
so, the MSW suggests that, by taking optimal value of
t ≈ 1.65 at the center of the QSL region, the QSL phase
should be visible even if the ﬁlling is changing consid-
erably. Suppose, for instance, that the trap is tuned to
have an occupation of around 3.7 atoms per site at the
center, that to say 20% above the half-ﬁlling condition.
Then, we could conclude that if we reach an occupation
of 3.3 atoms per site –20% below half ﬁlling– at 10 lat-
tice sites or more from the center, at the same time, we
are within validity of local-density approximation, in the
QSL phase as predicted by MSW theory, and we limit the
corrections due to the ﬁnite size as they are expected to
go down as the inverse of the diameter of the region con-
sidered. Our study therefore provides strong hints for a
robust spin liquid phase of bosons in anisotropic trian-
gular lattices with antiferromagnetic tunnelings, which
is not aﬀected by weak trapping potentials as used in ex-
periments.

The robustness of the spin-liquid phase in presence
of a weak harmonic conﬁnement allow for the exper-
imental investigation of these exotic quantum phases.
The realization of the XX Hamiltonian for bosons in the
strongly correlated regime relies on the periodic driv-
ing of the triangular optical lattice, which allows invert-
ing the sign of the tunneling matrix elements as well as
controlling their amplitude. The ability to tune the tun-
neling amplitude independently from the on-site inter-
action allows reaching strongly correlated phases where
U (cid:29) |Je f f| without increasing the lattice depth. Indeed,
as the eﬀective tunneling Je f f follows a zeroth-order
Bessel function as the shaking amplitude is increased,
the system shall ﬁrst enter a Mott-insulating phase be-
fore reaching the anti-ferromagnetic side of the phase
diagram and thus the quantum spin liquid phase. Such
a trajectory has allowed for a reversible crossing of the
superﬂuid to Mott-insulator phase transition in a driven
cubic lattice [73]. One limiting factor however are mul-
tiphoton resonances to higher lying Bloch bands, which
critically reduce the coherence of the bosonic gas [74].
These resonances occur when a multiple of the shak-
ing frequency matches the gap between the renormal-
ized bands. Therefore an optimized scheme for crossing
the quantum phase transition while avoiding such reso-
nances has to be developed.
