Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries are known to be an excellent absolute
distance indicator, yet it is unclear whether electromagnetic counterparts of these events are securely
identiﬁed for measuring their redshifts, especially in the case of black hole-black hole mergers such
as the one recently observed with the Advanced LIGO. We propose to use the cross-correlation
between spatial distributions of gravitational wave sources and galaxies with known redshifts as
an alternative means of constraining the distance-redshift relation from gravitational waves.
In
our analysis, we explicitly include the modulation of the distribution of gravitational wave sources
due to weak gravitational lensing. We show that the cross-correlation analysis in next-generation
observations will be able to tightly constrain the relation between the absolute distance and the
redshift, and therefore constrain the Hubble constant as well as dark energy parameters.

INTRODUCTION

The observation of the gravitational wave (GW)
signal GW150914 by Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) opened up the
possibility of using GWs as cosmological and astrophys-
ical probes [1–3]. GW150914 is a GW signal from a pair
of merging back holes (BHs) at z ∼ 0.1, with a mass of
each BH of M ∼ 30M⊙ , which were inferred by ﬁtting
the observed waveform with numerical relativity wave-
forms. The discovery of such a BH-BH merger event im-
plies that BH-BH mergers may be much more ubiquitous
than previously thought.

GWs from inspiraling compact binaries, which some-
times referred as standard sirens, are potentially a very
powerful cosmological probe, because they can determine
the absolute distances to the GW sources [4]. Assuming
general relativity, one can obtain information on masses
of inspiraling and merging objects from the shape of the
waveform, which then determines the absolute strain am-
plitude of GWs emitted from these objects. Thus the
comparison of the observed strain amplitude enables a di-
rect measurement of the luminosity distance to the GW
source.
Indeed, the luminosity distance to GW150914
was estimated to be 410+160
−180 Mpc using this technique
[1]. With the redshift information from independent ob-
servations of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, one
can directly constrain the absolute distance-redshift re-
lation, and hence obtains constraints on cosmological pa-
rameters including the Hubble constant and dark energy
parameters [5–16].

However, it is unclear whether EM counterparts can
really be observed.
In the case of GW150914, while a
hard X-ray emission that might possibly be associated
with GW150914 was detected with Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor [17], no conﬁrmed EM counterpart is re-

ported. Since mergers of BHs are not expected to have
EM counterparts, this association of the hard X-ray emis-
sion, if real, requires special explanations such as a BH-
BH merger in a dense environment (e.g. [18]). If a bulk
of BH-BH mergers do not have EM counterparts, their
use as a cosmological probe will be limited.

It has been argued that GWs from compact binary
mergers would be useful even if EM counterparts are not
identiﬁed. Nishizawa et al.
[19] discussed the possibil-
ity of exploiting the phase shift [20] of binary sources to
constrain cosmological parameters without EM counter-
parts. Messenger and Read [21] proposed to use tidal
eﬀects on merging neutron stars to break the degener-
acy to obtain information on the redshift of the system.
Another approach is to take advantage of the cluster-
ing property of GW sources. Recently, Namikawa et al.
[22] showed that the large-angle auto-correlation of GW
sources can provide tight constraints on primordial non-
Gaussianity.

In this paper, we propose the cross-correlation between
spatial distributions of compact binary GW sources with-
out redshift information and a galaxy sample with known
redshifts as a new method to extract cosmological infor-
mation from GWs. We show that this cross-correlation
extracts information on the distance-redshift relation and
hence constrains cosmological parameters including the
Hubble constant that determines the absolute distance
scale. This is made possible because the cross-correlation
signal is maximized when luminosity distances of GW
sources and redshifts of the galaxy sample matches. The
idea is similar to the cross-correlation of photometric and
spectroscopic galaxies to calibrate photometric redshifts
of galaxies [23]. A complication is that luminosity dis-
tances estimated from GWs are aﬀected by weak gravi-
tational lensing, which induces additional spatial correla-
tions on the sky (e.g., [15, 22]). In this paper we explicitly

include this eﬀect in our formulation.
This paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we
give our formulation. We present our result including
Fisher matrix analysis in Section III. Finally we give our
conclusion in Section IV. Our ﬁducial cosmological model
is based on the latest Planck result [24] and has matter
density Ωm = 0.308, dark energy density Ωde = 0.692,
baryon density Ωb = 0.04867, the dimensionless Hubble
constant h = 0.6763, the spectral index 0.9677, the nor-
malization of matter ﬂuctuations σ8 = 0.815, and dark
energy equation of state wde = −1. Throughout the pa-
per we assume a ﬂat Universe.

II. AUTO- AND CROSS-CORRELATIONS OF

GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SOURCES

A. Distance to gravitational wave sources

Observations of GWs from mergers of compact bina-
ries provide information on luminosity distances D to the
GW sources. On the other hand, their redshifts are not
a direct observable. In this paper, for simplicity, we as-
sume that the observed luminosity distance Dobs from
the analysis of the waveform is related to the true dis-
tance D via the log-normal distribution

p(Dobs|D) =

1

√2πσln D

exp(cid:2)−x2(Dobs)(cid:3)

1

Dobs

,

(1)

where

x(Dobs) ≡

ln Dobs − ln D

√2σln D

.

(2)

The dispersion on Dobs is caused by various eﬀects, in-
cluding the statistical error of GW observations and the
degeneracy of the luminosity distance with other param-
eters such as masses of compact objects and the inclina-
tion of the system. The parameter σln D quantiﬁes the
dispersion. Considering Einstein Telescope [25] like GW
observations, in this paper we assume the dispersion of
the distance estimate of σln D = 0.05 (e.g., [15]). In addi-
tion, weak gravitational lensing also aﬀects cosmological
distances. We include the eﬀect of weak gravitational
lensing explicitly by relating the distance D to the aver-
age distance ¯D, which represents the standard luminosity
distance computed from the homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe, as
D = ¯Dµ−1/2 ≈ ¯D [1 − κ(θ, z)] ,

(3)

where κ(θ, z) is the lensing convergence, which is a func-
tion of the sky position θ and redshift z. The lensing con-
vergence is essentially a projected matter density ﬁeld,
and is given by

κ(θ, z) = Z z

where δm(θ, z) is the matter density ﬁeld, H(z) is the
Hubble parameter, Σcrit(z; zs) is the (physical) critical
surface density at redshift z ′ for the source redshift z,
and ¯ρm(z) = Ωmρcr,0(1 + z)3 is a mean physical density
of the Universe at redshift z.

B. Projected density ﬁeld of gravitational wave

sources

We construct the i-th angular density ﬁeld of GW
sources by projecting them in the luminosity distance
range Dmin,i < Dobs < Dmax,i. Given the log-
normal relation between the observed and true dis-
tances, the angular number density is computed from the
three-dimensional number density ﬁeld of GW sources
nGW(θ, z) as

Here Tobs is the duration of the observation and ˙nGW(z)
is the rate of merger events that can be observed with
GW detectors of interest. The factor 1 + z in the denom-
inator accounts for the cosmological time dilation eﬀect.
The merger rate ˙nGW(z) has not yet been constrained
very well. The observation of GW150914 implies the BH-
˙nGW ∼ 10−6 − 10−8h3Mpc−3yr−1
BH merger rate of
at the local Universe [2]. Several models predict that
the BH-BH merger rate increases toward higher redshifts
(e.g., [26–28]). We can also use GWs from neutron star
mergers for our cross-correlation study, and their rate is
estimated to be of similar order. Thus in this paper we
assume Tobs ˙nGW = 3×10−6h3Mpc−3 over all the redshift
range of our interest.
The expression of the projected number density nw
i (θ)
allows us to deﬁne the projected density ﬁeld δ2D,w
(θ),
which plays a central role in our cross-correlation analy-
sis. While the main ﬂuctuation comes from the three-
dimensional distribution of GW sources, nGW(θ, z) =
¯nGW(z) [1 + δGW(θ, z)], the convergence in Eq. (3) in-
duces additional spatial ﬂuctuations. Assuming that

.(9)

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (8) describes the intrinsic spatial
inhomogeneity of GW sources, whereas the second term
of Eq. (8) comes from the apparent modulation of the
distribution of GW sources on the sky due to weak grav-
itational lensing which changes luminosity distances in-
ferred from waveforms. Eq. (9) implies that the second
term of Eq. (8) is smaller than the ﬁrst term, but as we
will show later, the second term can make dominate con-
tributions to correlation signals, because the convergence
contains accumulated information along the line-of-sight.

C. Angular correlation

For simplicity we assume a linear bias δGW = bGWδm
for GW sources. This assumption is reasonable in the
sense that mergers of compact binary objects are ex-
pected to be associated with galaxies which are known to
trace large-scale structure of the Universe. The angular
power spectrum of the density ﬁeld δ2D,w
(θ) in Eq. (8)
between i-th and j-th bins is calculated using the Lim-
ber’s approximation [29, 30] as

i

Cwiwj (ℓ) = Csisj (ℓ) + Csitj (ℓ) + Csj ti (ℓ) + Ctitj (ℓ),(10)

3

the cross spectrum is dominated by the so-called two-halo
term (see e.g., [31]), which suggests that we can use the
linear matter power spectrum for Pm(k; z) in Csisj and
Csitj . On the other hand, Ctitj is given by a projection
of all matter ﬂuctuations along the line-of-sight which
mixes small and large scale ﬂuctuations. Thus it may
be more appropriate to use the nonlinear matter power
spectrum for Pm(k; z) in Ctitj . In this paper, we compute
the transfer function of the linear matter power spectrum
using the result in [32], and the nonlinear matter power
spectrum using the result in [33].

D. Cross-correlation with spectroscopic galaxies

i-th bin deﬁned by the redshift range zmin,i < z < zmax,i

the average projected number density in the i-th bin is
simply computed as

(16)

In this paper we simply assume a constant number den-
sity of ¯ng = 10−3h3Mpc−3 which resembles e.g., a spec-
troscopic galaxy sample obtained by Euclid [34]. Using
the Limber’s approximation, the angular power spectrum
of spectroscopic galaxies between i-th and j-th bins is
given by

We now consider the cross-correlation between the GW
sources and the spectroscopic galaxies. From Eq. (8), we

(20)

We use the linear power spectrum for Pm(k; z) in both
Csigj and Ctj gj . The power spectrum Csigj comes from
the ﬁrst term of Eq. (8) and represents the physical corre-
lation of spatial distributions. On the other hand, Ctj gj ,
which comes from the second term of Eq. (8), is the cor-
relation of the weak lensing eﬀect on luminosity distances
of GW sources with spectroscopic galaxies. Since all
matter ﬂuctuations along the line-of-sight contributes to
weak lensing, it induces non-negligible cross-correlations
between luminosity and redshift bins which are well sep-
arated with each other.

III. RESULT

A. Cross-correlation signal

First it is useful to study the cross angular power spec-
trum Cwigj (ℓ) which is deﬁned in Eq. (18). We ﬁx the lu-
minosity distance bin of GW sources to that corresponds
to 0.9 < z < 1.1 in our ﬁducial cosmological model.
On the other hand, we move the central redshift of the
spectroscopic galaxy sample while ﬁxing the bin width
to ∆z = 0.1 in order to see how the cross-correlation
signal changes as a function of the redshift of the spec-
troscopic galaxy sample. For bias parameters, we assume
a simple parametric form bGW(z) = bw1 + bw2/D(z) and
bg = bg1 +bg2/D(z), where D(z) is the linear growth rate,
and choose ﬁducial parameter values as bw1 = bw2 = 1
and bg1 = bg2 = 1.

Fig. 1 shows the cross-correlation power spectrum at
multiple ℓ = 100 as a function of the central redshift of
the spectroscopic galaxy sample zg. When the redshift of
the spectroscopic galaxy sample well overlaps with that of
GW sources, the cross-correlation signal becomes large.
In this case, the cross-correlation signal is dominated by
the physical correlation of density ﬁelds of GW sources
and spectroscopic galaxies, which corresponds to Csg de-
ﬁned in Eq. (19). The cross-correlation signal is max-
imized when the luminosity distance bin best matches
with the redshift bin, from which we can infer the relation
between the luminosity distance and redshift. However,
Fig. 1 indicates that the cross-correlation signal extend
to much lower redshift of the spectroscopic galaxy sam-
ple. This extra correlation originates from Ctg deﬁned
in Eq. (20). As stated above, this term represents the
correlation of galaxies and matter ﬂuctuations along the
line-of-sight that induces weak gravitational lensing ef-
fect on luminosity distances of GW sources. We include
this large-distance cross-correlations in our Fisher matrix
analysis below.

GW sources and galaxies [Eq. (18)]. The luminosity dis-
tance range of GW sources is ﬁxed to that corresponds to
0.9 < z < 1.1 (gray shaded region) in our ﬁducial cosmol-
ogy. The spectroscopic galaxy sample has the redshift range
zg − ∆z/2 < z < zg + ∆z/2 with ∆z = 0.1. Solid line shows
the cross-correlation power spectrum at multipole ℓ = 100
as a function of the central redshift of the galaxy sample zg.
Dotted and dashed lines show contributions of C sg [Eq. (19)]
and C tg [Eq. (20)] to C wg, respectively.

B. Fisher matrix analysis

Here we estimate how well we can constrain the
distance-redshift relation and hence cosmological param-
eters from the cross-correlation analysis. For this pur-
pose we need the covariance matrix of auto- and cross-
correlation power spectra. Assuming Gaussian statistics,
the covariance matrix is given by

Cov(cid:2)Cij (ℓ), Cmn(ℓ′)(cid:3) =

4π
Ωs

δℓℓ′

(2ℓ + 1)∆ℓ

×(cid:16) ˜Cim ˜Cjn + ˜Cin ˜Cjm(cid:17) ,(21)

where the indices i, j, . . . run over wi and gi, Ωs is the
survey area, ∆ℓ is the width of ℓ bin, and ˜C denotes the
power spectrum including shot noise

TABLE I: Expected marginalized errors on each cosmological
parameter. See text for details.

We compute the Fisher matrix with the following
setup. For the correlation among GW sources [Cwiwj ; see
Eq. (10)], while there are weak correlations between dif-
ferent luminosity distance bins, we ignore them and con-
sider only correlations between the same luminosity dis-
tance bins (i.e., Cwiwj ≈ δij Cwiwi ). This is because such
weak correlations between diﬀerent bins are expected not
to aﬀect our results due to relatively large shot noise of
GW sources. The correlation among spectroscopic galax-
ies [Cgigj ; see Eq. (17)] also does not have any correla-
tion between diﬀerent redshift bins. On the other hand,
we consider all the combination of bins for the cross-
correlation [Cwigj ; see Eq. (18)], given that there are
large-distance correlations as shown in Fig. 1.

As stated above, observations we have in mind are the
Einstein Telescope [25] for GWs and Euclid [34] for spec-
troscopic galaxies, although we do not tune our param-
eters to these surveys very carefully. We consider the
redshift range of 0.3 < z < 1.5, where the maximum
redshift mainly comes from the upper limit of redshifts
of the spectroscopic galaxy sample. We deﬁne luminos-
ity distance bins of GW sources by the distance width
corresponding to ∆z = 0.2, and compute the minimum
(Di,min) and maximum (Di,max) luminosity distances in
each bin using the standard luminosity distance-redshift
relation in our ﬁducial cosmological model. Thus we have
Nw = 6 luminosity distance bins for GW sources. On
the other hand, we deﬁne redshift bins for spectroscopic
galaxies with the interval ∆z = 0.1, leading to Ng = 12
bins. We also consider all the Nw × Ng cross-correlations
for our Fisher matrix analysis. Therefore, the total num-
ber of elements of Cij vector in Eq. (23) is 90. This means
that the covariance matrix has the dimension 90 × 90.
As for cosmological parameters, we consider h, Ωm,
and wde as parameters controlling the distance-redshift
relation. We also include σ8, which determines the nor-
malization of power spectra, as a parameter. In addition,
we include bias parameters bw1, bw2, bg1, and bg2 (see
Sec. III A) as nuisance parameters. In total we have 8
parameters that constitute pα in Eq. (23). All the pa-
rameters are treated as free parameters, except σ8 for
which we add a weak prior σ(σ8) = 0.1 because we ﬁnd
that σ8 strongly degenerates with the bias parameters.

We consider the multipole range 10 < ℓ < ℓmax. The
maximum multipole ℓmax should be determined from the
angular resolution of GW observations. The angular res-
olution of the Einstein Telescope network corresponds to
approximately ℓmax = 100 [22, 35], which we adopt as
a ﬁducial value. However we also consider an optimistic
case ℓmax = 300 in order to check the dependence of our

FIG. 2: Projected 68% conﬁdence limit constraints in the
Ωm-h (top) and Ωm-wde (bottom) planes. In each panel, the
other model parameters are marginalized over. Solid lines

constraints for ℓmax = 100.

results on ℓmax. Finally we assume the survey area of
Ωs = 15000 deg2 which is covered by Euclid.

Fig. 2 shows marginalized errors on cosmological pa-
rameters for both ℓmax = 100 and ℓmax = 300. We ﬁnd
that tight constraints on the Hubble constant as well as
dark energy parameters can be obtained from the cross-
correlation analysis. The summary of constraints given
in Table I indicates that a percent level constraint on
the Hubble constant can be obtained, suggesting that
the distance-redshift relation is successfully constrained.
We also note a large improvement of constraints from
ℓmax = 100 to ℓmax = 300, which implies that accurate
localizations of GW sources on the sky are crucial for the
cross-correlation analysis.

The expected accuracy of cosmological parameter esti-
mation depends on several parameters such as the num-
ber density of GW sources and their bias factors, which
are poorly known. For comparison, we consider more pes-
simistic case with an order of magnitude smaller number
density of GW sources, Tobs ˙nGW = 3 × 10−7h3Mpc−3,
and repeat the Fisher matrix calculation. We ﬁnd that
the change of the expected constraint on the Hubble con-

stant is modest, from σ(h) = 0.016 to 0.030 for ℓmax =
100, and from σ(h) = 0.007 to 0.013 for ℓmax = 300. This
suggests that the cross-correlation technique is still use-
ful even when the GW rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than
our ﬁducial value.

We note that the expressions of the angular power
spectra in this paper have been derived using the Lim-
ber’s approximation which breaks down at small ℓ [30,
36]. We expect that this approximation is valid for
the purpose of this paper, because the cross-correlation
signal mainly comes from large ℓ, ℓ ∼ ℓmax, at which
the Limber’s approximation is expected to be reason-
ably accurate for our choice of ∆z = 0.1 for the spectro-
scopic galaxy sample. Limber’s approximation becomes
inaccurate for cross-correlation with large redshift diﬀer-
ences, but due to relative large shot noise such cross-
correlation does not contribute to the result very much.
Although there is a long tail of cross-correlation signals
toward lower redshifts (Fig. 1), it is essentially the cross-
correlation of galaxies and matter at the same redshift
and hence the Limber’s approximation is again accurate.
Nevertheless, we caution that the full calculation without
the Limber’s approximation may be required for more ac-
curate predictions of the cross-correlation signals, which
is beyond the scope of this paper.

IV. CONCLUSION

GWs from mergers of compact objects such as BHs
serve as a useful cosmological probe because they allow
us to directly measure absolute distance scales. However,
in order to constrain the distance-redshift relation from
GW sources we also need redshift information. While
the redshift information may be obtained from observa-
tions of EM counterparts, it is unclear whether such EM
counterparts can be reliably identiﬁed, especially for BH-
BH mergers. In this paper, we propose to use the cross-
correlation of GW sources with spectroscopic galaxies as
an alternative means of constraining the distance-redshift
relation. We have explicitly included the eﬀect of weak
gravitational lensing on luminosity distance estimates in
our formulation. Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we
have shown that tight constraints on the Hubble constant

as well as dark energy parameters can be obtained by the
cross-correlation of GW sources observed by the Einstein
Telescope and spectroscopic galaxies observed by Euclid.
Constraints on absolute distance scales at cosmologi-
cal distances are not directly obtained except a few cases
(e.g., [37–40]). GW standard sirens therefore oﬀer invalu-
able information on the distance-redshift relation includ-
ing the absolute distance scale. Our analysis has shown
that it is possible to constrain the distance-redshift re-
lation even without identifying EM counterparts of GW
sources and thus without any redshift information on in-
dividual GW sources.

Finally we note that there is room for improving con-
straints on the distance-redshift relation from the cross-
correlation analysis. For instance, while we have re-
stricted our analysis to z < 1.5, GWs can be detected
out to much higher redshifts in next-generation GW ob-
servations. For those high-redshift GWs, we can use
high-redshift tracers such as quasars, or we may also
be able to galaxies with photometric redshifts for the
cross-correlation analysis, if their photometric redshifts
are accurate enough. For example, Euclid’s near-infrared
photometry, when combined with ground-based optical
photometry, enables an accurate determination of pho-
tometric redshifts easily out to z ∼ 3 [41]. Photometric
galaxies are much denser and therefore lead to more sig-
niﬁcant detections of cross-correlation signals, which sug-
gests that cross-correlation of GW sources with galaxies
with photometric redshifts has a great potential to en-
hance the use of the cross-correlation method proposed
in this paper. The distance-redshift relation may also
be constrained by cross-correlating GW sources with to-
mographic weak lensing [42]. We leave exploring these
possibilities for future work.
