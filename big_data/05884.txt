The small fraction of the quark polarization of the nucleon obtained in deep inelastic lepton
scattering is a consequence of a wrong assumption on the ﬂux of polarized virtual photons in the
analysis of the data. The true ﬂux of polarized photons is at least 20% smaller than assumed
and, therefore, the quark polarization is larger. Realizing this peculiarity the quark polarization
agrees with that given by the Ellis-Jaﬀe sum rule, i.e.
is consistent with the prediction derived
from the experimentally determined weak coupling constants. It also solves the problem with the
under-exhaustion of the fundamental Bjorken-sum rule.

INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst measurement of the spin polarization of
the quarks in the proton in deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
of muons [1] the fraction of the spin carried by the quarks
was found to be much smaller than the value ∆Σ = 0.59
expected by the Ellis-Jaﬀe sum rule [2] deduced from
the SU(3) constituent quark model. This ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed by the subsequent experiments at CERN of
the SMC Collaboration [3] and at SLAC by the E143
Collaboration [4] and called somewhat caricaturing the
”nucleon-spin crisis”. A detailed summary is given in [5].
The recent measurement of the HERMES Collabora-
tion at HERA [6] using the ”modiﬁed minimal subtrac-
tion” scheme [7] determines that only ∆Σ = 0.330±0.025
of the spin momentum of the nucleon is contributed by
the quarks if measured at a resolution of Q2 = 5 GeV2.
The precision is much improved due to a measurement
on the deuteron. We use for the presentation in this
letter the precise measurement of the HERMES Collab-
oration and the corrections applied by them [6]. A more
recent publication of the COMPASS collaboration [8] is
somewhat less precise and has problems which will be
discussed later. Any further theoretical uncertainties are
not included and we refrain from listing them since they
are not relevant for the further discussion.

The quark polarization of the nucleon obtained from
the constituent quark model of Cabbibo [9, 10] is essen-
tially determined by the values of the measured axial-
vector coupling constant gnp
A from the neutron decay and
the axial-vector coupling for the strangeness changing Σ
decay gΣn
A . Together with the Ellis-Jaﬀe sum rule one
obtains ∆Σ = 0.59 ± 0.03.

So far there were many attempts to explain the surpris-
ing small fraction of the spin carried by quarks derived
from DIS. In the frame work of SU(3) it is not possi-
ble to reconcile the two experimental results: the quark
polarization fraction derived from the weak coupling con-
stants and the Ellis-Jaﬀe sum rule, and the fraction ob-

tained from DIS. The weak interaction is strictly spin
dependent and because of the short range of the interac-
tion no distortion is expected. On the other hand, the
electromagnetic interaction at high lepton energies is con-
taminated by strong interaction and may manifest strong
distortion. This aspect has been ignored until today and
it seems to be justiﬁed to revisit the analysis of the mea-
surement of the quark polarization in DIS and ask for its
validity.

MEASUREMENT WITH POLARIZATION

The polarized structure functions are derived from a
measurement of the cross section asymmetry of the scat-
tering of longitudinally polarized leptons on longitudi-
nally polarized nucleons. The asymmetry A is deter-
mined in subsequent runs with the nucleon spin orien-
tated parallel and antiparallel to the polarized virtual
photon normalized to the integrated luminosity in de-
pendance of the Bjorken x. It is divided by the sum of
the cross sections of the two relative spin orientations so
that the integrated ﬂux cancels:

A =

dσ↑↓ − dσ↑↑
dσ↑↓ + dσ↑↑ .

(1)

The spin structure functions are, however, propor-
tional to the absolute diﬀerence of the cross sections
of the two relative spin orientations. Therefore, in the
analysis of all experiments the asymmetries were multi-
plied by the high statistics unpolarized structure func-
tion. These structure functions have been measured by
assuming that the ﬂux of virtual photons is that pre-
supposed in the QED formulae for the scattering by the
electromagnetic interaction. We argue in this letter that
this assumption is wrong.

In order to see this we must realize that DIS is not
an entirely perturbative process as has been pointed

out already early by several authors [11–14]. The pho-
ton may ﬂuctuate in a quark-antiquark pair representing
a hadronic component in the virtual exchange photon.
These longitudinal quark-antiquark pairs loose their en-
ergy by the emission and absorption of soft gluons. Con-
sequently, the cross section of the longitudinal quark-
antiquark pairs cannot have any noticeable spin depen-
dence and a fraction of the virtual photon ﬂux has to be
considered as unpolarized.

Experimentally the existence of these pairs and their
interaction length has been demonstrated in the shadow-
ing of DIS on nuclei in the quark sea at x < 0.1 [15]. Be-
fore we discuss the consequences we want to look in more
detail at the ﬂuctuations. This is best done if the DIS is
viewed in the nucleon rest frame [16]. The predominant
part of the quark-antiquark pairs are small with a dimen-
tot ∝ 1/Q2 and
sion given by Q2. Their cross section is σh N
is spin dependent. But there are also the longitudinal
quark-antiquark pairs of hadronic size µ with a trans-
tot ∝ 1/µ2. In the discus-
verse hadronic cross section σh N
sion of this component for the shadowing of photons in
nuclei it is assumed that these pairs contribute to the sea
quarks of the structure function. This assumption is jus-
tiﬁed by the consideration of the so called ”Joﬀe time”
t = 1/(2mpx) [15, 17]. At small x < 0.1, the sea quark
region, this length is large t > µ = 1 fm. For larger
x this length gets smaller than the hadronic scale sug-
gesting that the assumption of a point probe is correct.
However, in the rest frame of the hadronic ﬂuctuation
the correct scale is µ in all coordinates. If one Lorentz
transforms this sphere into the rest frame of the proton
it stays a sphere of the same scale.∗ This means that one
has to assume a soft non-perturbative component with
the typical hadronic scale also at 0.1 (cid:54) x (cid:54) 1 in the
interaction of the virtual photon with the nucleon.

In [17] it was argued that the weight of the small hard
pairs is about 1, whereas the probability of the large soft
pairs is suppressed by W γ(cid:63)
h = µ2/Q2. Considering the ar-
gument on the longitudinal scale of the ﬂuctuation this is
valid for all x. This means that in the product W γ(cid:63)
h σh N
tot
the hadronic scale cancels and both transverse cross sec-
tions, the hard and the soft ﬂuctuations are of the same
order of magnitude. As has been pointed out in [17]
not only the perturbative small hard ﬂuctuations, but
also the soft non-perturbative ﬂuctuations show Bjorken
scaling.

∗ This observation is strange to many who assume that this trans-
formation produces a pancake shape [15, 18]. However, it has
been recognized since long that this is not correct [19, 20]. Roger
Penrose also presented the general proof that a sphere stays a
sphere for all angles of observation [21]. It just rotates. ”Obser-
vation” means here the requirement that all particles mediating
the interaction - here the gluons with the speed of light - from
the surface of a sphere arrive at the same time at the point of ob-
servation, i.e. of interaction. This has to be distinguished from
Einsteins measurement with synchronized clocks [22].

2

A more quantitative way to estimate the non-
perturbative contribution in DIS is by considering the
ratio of the integrated diﬀractive and the total cross sec-
tions. Diﬀractive cross section in DIS means the scatter-
ing on a color neutral ﬂuctuation of the nucleon and cor-
responds to the soft interaction described in the nucleon
rest frame. Such measurements have been performed at
HERA by the ZEUS and H1 Collaborations, in partic-
ular as semi inclusive measurements of the leading pro-
ton and neutron [23, 24]. In both experiments the DIS
takes place on a color singlet ﬂuctuation with a leading
proton or neutron proceeding unhindered in forward di-
rection. These events show up in the deep quark sea at
small x < 0.01 and represent a good estimate of the soft
non-perturbative component in the proton. ZEUS gets a
ratio f = 0.36 [25] and H1 gets f = 0.26 ± 0.06 [26] in
agreement with the estimate of Halina Abramowicz [27]
f = 0.30 . . . 0.40

The consequence of this situation is that one has to
consider two parts in the ﬂux of the photon beam: one
polarized hard part and one non polarized soft part with
a relative interaction probability of r = 1− f (0 (cid:54) r (cid:54) 1)
and f respectively. However, it is evident that the polar-
ized cross sections have to be normalized to the polarized
and not to the total ﬂux. There are two ways to look at
the correction for these two components (see the formulae
in e.g. [1]):

• In the asymmetry in Eq. (1) the ﬂux cancels, but
multiplying with the unpolarized structure func-
tion means eﬀectively to normalize to the total ﬂux.
Therefore, the ﬂux is a factor of 1/r to large and
the structure function has to be divided by r.

• The unpolarized structure function appears in the
nominator and denominator in the asymmetry and
cancels. One is then left with the polarized cross
sections wrongly normalized to the total ﬂux and
one has to multiply the absolute diﬀerence of the
polarized structure functions by 1/r.

This means that one has to multiply all results of the
polarized structure functions and the integrals derived
from them by 1/r.

The spin fraction carried by the valence quarks ∆Σ is
identical to the singlet axial coupling a0 = ∆Σ and cal-
culated from the integral over the the polarized deuteron
structure function Γd

ments - the one of HERMES by as much as 10% - and
still their own data are below these ﬁts. It is understand-
able that they try to fathom the possibilities to proof the
fundamental Bjorken-sum rule from the existing data,
however with the realization of the idea presented in this
paper the Bjorken sum as well as the Ellis-Jaﬀe-sum rule
are in accord with the data naturally.

DISCUSSION

In the following we want to discuss the consequences
for the quark distributions if one assumes the natural val-
ues for the weak coupling constants a0 = ∆Σ = 0.59±0.1,
a3, and a8 as given above. The large error of a0 is an ad-
hoc assumption of our lack of knowledge of the fraction of
the soft ﬂuctuations and their cross sections. The quark
distributions for the lightest three ﬂavors u, d, s (see e.g.
[6]) can be expressed as the singlet charge a0, the axial
vector charge a3 = gA and the hyper charge a8. In the
SU(3) constituent quark model the quark helicity distri-
butions read:

a0 =(∆u + ∆¯u) + (∆d + ∆ ¯d) + (∆s + ∆¯s) = ∆Σ (4)
a3 =(∆u + ∆¯u) − (∆d + ∆ ¯d)
(5)
a8 =(∆u + ∆¯u) + (∆d + ∆ ¯d) − (∆s + ∆¯s)
(6)
With the correct value for a0 = 0.59 ± 0.1 one gets :

(∆u + ∆¯u) = 0.932 ± 0.034
(∆d + ∆ ¯d) = −0.337 ± 0.034
(∆s + ∆¯s) = 0.005 ± 0.034

(8)

(9)

This has to be compared to the values with the uncor-

rected a0 = 0.330 ± 0.025 of HERMES [6].

(∆u + ∆¯u) = 0.843 ± 0.014
(∆d + ∆ ¯d) = −0.427 ± 0.014
(∆s + ∆¯s) = −0.087 ± 0.017

The large errors of the corrected values contain the
range of the fraction of the soft non-perturbative compo-
nent f not existing for the assumption of a 100% polar-
ized photon beam.

In Fig. 2 we show the quark distributions again as a
function of the hadronic fraction f . Particularly the
reduction of the contribution of the strange sea is re-
markable, now compatible with no contribution of the
strange sea to the polarization meaning that the SU(2)
description would be suﬃcient or at least a good approx-
imation. Of course, this simple calculations neglect any
next-to-leading order corrections or ﬁnite quark masses

holds where we assume the most recent values [28] for
the weak charges a3 = gA = 1.269 ± 0.003 and a8 =
0.586 ± 0.031. The assumption of this value for a3 given
by the neutron beta decay means the exact exhaustion
of the Bjorken-sum rule. For further details we refer to
the paper of the HERMES Collaboration [6]. The depen-
dence of ∆Σ represented by these equations as a function
of f = 1 − r is depicted in Fig. 1 The Ellis-Jaﬀe-sum
rule requires that a0 = ∆Σ = 0.59. For the HERMES
deuteron one reads fd = 0.36 ± 0.05 and for the COM-
PASS deuteron the consistent value fd = 0.32 ± 0.08, for
the HERMES proton fp = 0.27± 0.05 and for the COM-
PASS proton the less consistent value a0 = 0.15 ± 0.10.
However, for the deuteron consisting of a bound proton
and neutron with a size of the strong scale one has to real-
ize that the absorption of a soft non-perturbative ﬂuctu-
ation of the same scale will be coherent. Therefore fd will
be larger than fp since the cross section of the deuteron
for the ﬂuctuation will be larger. This is in contrast to
the correct assumption of incoherent scattering in DIS,
i.e. the linear addition of the photon cross sections.

A remark is in place on the diﬀerence of the f HERMES
and f COMPASS
. The HERMES proton data are based on
their own unscaled measurement and due to its insuﬃ-
cient accuracy they do not extrapolate to x → 0 and re-
frain from comparing to the Bjorken-sum rule [6]. COM-
PASS uses a ﬁt of the ”world data” of Γp
1 and determines
a3 from ΓNS
1 , i.e. checks the Bjorken-sum rule, however
without looking at the spin content [8]. In their ﬁts they

photon probe contains a hard part, the electromagnetic
interaction proper, and a soft non-perturbative part due
the quark-antiquark ﬂuctuations. The old natural idea
that the nucleon can be well described as composed of
constituent massive quarks which was so successful in
explaining the excitation spectrum of the nucleon, the
baryon spectrum, and the ratio of the magnetic moments
is reestablished. The experimental ﬁnding that the nu-
cleon is a strongly coupled relativistic many body system
which shows in leading order scaling of point like almost
massless quarks is not in contradiction since the soft non-
perturbative hadronic part of the photon also scales as ar-
gued. Depending on the resolution of the probe one ﬁnds
scaling violations which converge in the limit of vanishing
momentum transfer to the eﬀective constituent quarks.
We have shown that this idea can be maintained.

per over years, and Jan-Erik Olsson for providing expla-
nations and details of the H1 and ZEUS results.

breaking the SU(3) symmetry. But the values give an
indication how dramatic our idea about the spin compo-
sition changes with the correct value for a0 = ∆Σ. The
small or vanishing strange quark contribution remedies
also the diﬀerence of the strange quark-helicity distri-
butions of the HERMES result given above from earlier
HERMES results obtained by semi-inclusive DIS [6].

It is not very likely that one can improve the accuracy
of the ratio of hard photon and soft non-perturbative
hadron parts theoretically. The measurement of the spin
polarization in the deep inelastic scattering will thus not
improve our knowledge of the quark spins beyond the
information from the neutron and hyperon decays. How-
ever, the importance of the non-perturbative eﬀects in
the deep inelastic scattering became very clear.

It is interesting to note that the standard evolution
of the structure function does not consider the non-
perturbative eﬀects. Going back to the system in which
the nucleon is in the inﬁnite momentum frame and re-
alizing that about 30% of the events go via the non-
perturbative scattering it becomes clear how naive is the
picture of the noninteracting partons of the nucleon in the
Weizs¨acker-Williams system. The shape of the structure
function is controlled with roughly equal weight by the
perturbative as well as non-perturbative processes.
In
spite of this observation the structure functions can be
forced in the perturbative corset since both the pertur-
bative and the non-perturbative deep inelastic scattering
obey Bjorken scaling [17].

CONCLUSION

In conclusion we have presented a solution for the much
discussed ”spin crisis” of the nucleon: the valence quarks
carry the major part of the nucleon spin indeed. This
solution emerges naturally from the realization that the
