We show that degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in nonlinear optics can be described by
an eﬀective Hamiltonian that is pseudo-Hermitian, which enables a transition between a pseudo-
Hermitian phase with real eigenvalues and a broken pseudo-Hermitian phase with complex conjugate
eigenvalues. While bearing certain similarity to that in Parity-Time symmetric systems, this transition
is in stark contrast because of the absence of gain and loss in the eﬀective Hamiltonian. The latter is
real after factoring out the system decay, and the onset of non-Hermiticity in degenerate FWM is
due to the total phase change of the signal wave and the idler wave. This property underlines the
intrinsic coherence in FWM, which opens the door to probe quantum implications of exceptional
points.

Exceptional points (EPs) are intriguing topological
structures responsible for many counter-intuitive phenom-
ena in non-Hermitian systems [1–8], including the phase
transition in Parity-Time (PT ) symmetric systems [9–24]
and laser self termination in a photonic molecule laser
[25–28]. EPs occur when two or more eigenvalues and
eigenstates of an eﬀective Hamiltonian coalesce, and so far
the study of EPs has been limited to complex-valued eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonians, which can be realized, for example, by
adding gain and loss to a Hermitian system. In addition,
while many systems used to probe the properties of EPs
are quantum in nature, the qualitative change around the
EP observed so far can be explained by purely classical
arguments, and quantum coherence has not been shown
to play an important role.

In this letter we advance profoundly our understanding
of EPs and non-Hermitian physics in general on both
of these fronts, by identifying and probing a real-valued
eﬀective Hamiltonian in an intrinsically coherent process,
i.e., degenerate four wave mixing (FWM). FWM is a
nonlinear optical process in which two pump frequencies
interact and generate two sidebands, one with higher fre-
quency (“signal”) and one with lower frequency (“idler”).
The process is called degenerate FWM when the two
pump frequencies coincide. The discovery of nonlinear
optical eﬀects [29–31] was a hallmark in the study of light-
matter interactions, and FWM in particular is important
for generating broadband light with high spatial coher-
ence (i.e., supercontinuum generation) and parametric
ampliﬁcation.

As we show below, the eﬀective Hamiltonian of
degenerate FWM is not only real but also pseudo-
Hermitian, which enables a transition between a pseudo-

Hermitian phase with real eigenvalues and a broken
pseudo-Hermitian phase with complex conjugate eigen-
values. While bearing certain similarity to that in PT -
symmetric systems, this transition is in stark contrast
because of the absence of gain and loss in the eﬀective
Hamiltonian. As a result, this pseudo-Hermitian tran-
sition is not caused by the intensity asymmetry of the
signal and idler waves in the eigenstates, but rather by
the change of the total phase of these two waves. In other
words, the intrinsic coherence in degenerate FWM is the
key for the onset of non-Hermiticity and brings the system
to the pseudo-Hermitian phase, which opens the door to
probe quantum implications of exceptional points.

Below we consider a system with passive resonances
ωi, ωp, and ωs before the pump beam is applied, with
ωi < ωp < ωs (see Fig. 1). These resonances can be those
of an atomic system [32] or an engineered microstructure

does not always have real eigenvalues as mentioned earlier.
In fact it is pseudo-Hermtian [34], which is deﬁned by

(7)
in general, where σ is an arbitrary matrix, σ−1 is its
inverse, and “†” denotes Hermitian conjugation. For
a pseudo-Hermitian matrix H, its eigenvalues λ can ei-
ther be real or form complex conjugate pairs [34]. The
ﬁrst scenario requires σ−1|φm(cid:105) ∝ |φm(cid:105), where |φm(cid:105) is
an eigenstate of H; the second scenario implies that
σ−1|φm(cid:105) ∝ |φn(cid:105), where |φn(cid:105) is a diﬀerent eigenstate and
the corresponding eigenvalues satisfy λm = λ∗
n.

σz = (cid:0) 1 0

For degenerate FWM described by Eq. (3), the trans-
formation σ in Eq. (7) is given by the Pauli matrix

where the EP is located at | ¯∆| ≡ |∆s + ∆i|/2 = g. λ±
are both real when | ¯∆| ≥ g, which we will refer to as the
pseudo-Hermitian phase; they form a complex conjugate
pair when | ¯∆| < g, which we will refer to as the broken
pseudo-Hermitian phase [see Fig. 2(a,b)]. We note that
the two (oﬀ-diagonal) coupling elements of H have oppo-
site signs. This is a distinct feature of degenerate FWM
and leads to the pseudo-Hermitian transition; H would
not have an EP or complex eigenvalues if its real-valued
coupling elements have the same sign, e.g., H12 = H21
(or more generally, H12 = H∗
21 if they are complex). The

nonlinear medium near ωp, and a weak signal wave of
frequency Ωs and amplitude Ain
s may also be applied near
ωs to probe the response of the system. We will refer to
the other generated sideband at frequency Ωi ∼ ωi as the
idler wave.

Such a degenerate FWM process can be described by

the following coupled equations [32]:

Here As,i are the slowly-varying (complex) amplitudes of
the signal wave and the idler wave, measured in their re-
spective rotating frames and inside the nonlinear medium.
Their decay rates are denoted by κs,i and for simplicity
we consider κs = κi ≡ κ. ∆s,i are the frequency de-
tunings from the corresponding passive frequencies, i.e.
∆s,i = ωs,i − Ωs,i + Gs,i [33]. We note that Gs,i are
the nonlinear frequency shifts due to the coupling of the
pump beam and the signal/idler wave (i.e., “cross phase
modulation”), and they are proportional to the intensity
of the pump beam. This linear relation holds for the
coupling constant g as well, which we take to be real and
positive for convenience. As we will see, this choice does
not change the property of our system. Finally, p is the
coupling rate of the injected signal wave into the system.
To determine the inherent dynamics of degenerate
FWM, we ﬁrst study the eﬀective Hamiltonian H of
the system in the absence of the signal
input (i.e.,
Ain
s = 0). By performing a negative complex conju-
gation of Eq. (2), we arrive at the following equations for

properties of λ±, because H21 becomes g∗ if g is com-
plex, and the g2 term in the radicand of Eq. (8) is simply
replaced by |g|2.
To distinguish this pseudo-Hermitian transition from
a similar one in PT symmetric systems and anti-PT
symmetric systems [35], ﬁrst it is worth noting in all these
systems the transition occurs at a square root singularity,
where the radicand vanishes and marks an EP. In PT
symmetric systems, the transition can be understood
straightforwardly from the change of their spatial intensity
proﬁles: when the optical modes have equal intensities
in the gain and loss regions, they do not feel any net
gain or loss, and hence the eigenvalues are real; when
this symmetry is broken, then the mode with a higher
intensity in the gain (loss) region will be subjected to
a net gain (loss), resulting in an amplifying (decaying)
eigenvalue with a positive (negative) imaginary part. This
is a purely classical eﬀect and quantum coherence does
not play a role.

In degenerate FWM, there is no gain or loss in the
eﬀective Hamiltonian given by Eq. (3), and attempting
to interpret the pseudo-Hermitian transition in a similar
way, i.e., using the intensity asymmetry of the signal
wave and the idler wave, is problematic. In fact, we ﬁnd
that in the pseudo-Hermitian phase the two waves have
diﬀerent intensities in both eigenstates of H and that in
the broken pseudo-Hermitian phase they have the same
intensity [see Fig. 2(c)]. These observations are exactly
opposite of PT -symmetric systems, which implies that the
pseudo-Hermitian transition must be driven by a diﬀerent
mechanism.

To identify this mechanism, we note that FWM is
an intrinsically coherent process, and the phases of the
signal wave and the idler wave play an important role.
This feature is ﬁrst manifested by a sudden change of
θ ≡ Arg[AsAi] = Arg[ ˜Ai ˜As] across the EP [see Fig. 2(d)]:
for | ¯∆| ≥ g, the phase θ in both eigenstates of H is inde-
pendent of | ¯∆|/g and equal to π (0) when g is positive
(negative); for | ¯∆| < g however, θ evolves diﬀerently in
these two eigenstates as a function of | ¯∆|/g. To further
conﬁrm that the change of θ is the factor driving the
pesudo-Hermitian transition, we write down the dynami-
cal equation for | ˜As|2 +| ˜Ai|2 when there is no signal input
(i.e., Ain

s = 0):

(cid:16)| ˜As|2 + | ˜Ai|2(cid:17)

∂
∂t

= 2gIm[ ˜Ai ˜As].

(9)

The right hand side of this equation, which equals
2g| ˜Ai ˜As| sin θ, highlights the role of the coherence repre-
sented by θ. When θ = 0 or π, the system does not exhibit
additional loss or gain and stays in the pseudo-Hermitian
phase. When θ changes its value, energy ﬂows in or out
from the system via the pump and the system reaches
the broken pseudo-Hermitian phase. These behaviors are
exactly what Fig. 2 depicts.

3

As we have shown, the average detuning ¯∆ and the
nonlinear coupling g are the controling knobs to tune
the systems across the exceptional point. g can be con-
veniently varied by changing the pump intensity, and
so does ¯∆ via the nonlinear frequency shifts Gs,i. The
phase matching condition of degenerate FWM requires
2kp = ki + ks, where ki,p,s are the wavevectors of the
idler, pump, and signal waves. Assuming a simple linear
dispersion relation Ω ∝ |k| as well as ki (cid:107) kp (cid:107) ks and
equally spaced passive resonances (i.e., 2ωp = 2ωi + ωs),
we ﬁnd that ¯∆ = (Gs + Gi)/2 ≈ 2g when the pump
frequency coincides with the central resonance (Ωp = ωp)
[33], which indicates that the system is always in the
pseudo-Hermitian phase with Im[λ±] = 0. To reduce the
value of ¯∆ to g and reach the broken pseudo-Hermitian
phase, one possibility is to blue-shift the pump beam
from the center resonance, i.e., Ωp > ωp. As a result,
Ωi + Ωs = 2Ωp still holds but the sum is larger than
2ωp = ωs + ωi, meaning that | ¯∆| ≈ |2g − (Ωp − ωp)| < 2g.
This observation indicates that for a given pump power
(and hence a given g as well), the system enters the broken
pseudo-Hermitian phase when the pump frequency Ωp
becomes larger than ωp + g. Alternatively, by ﬁxing the
frequency of the blue-detuned pump beam and reducing
its intensity (and hence g), the system enters the broken
pseudo-Hermitian phase when g becomes smaller than
Ωp − ωp.

To experimentally detect the pseudo-Hermitian tran-
sition, we ﬁrst note that both eigenstates of the system,
expressed in terms of (As, A∗
i )T and with the system de-
cay κ restored, exhibit a decaying behavior near the EP
s (cid:54)= 0,
[see Eq. (4)]. Therefore, with a ﬁnite signal input Ain
the signal wave and idler wave approach their steady state
values given by Eqs. (5) and (6) in the long run, which
however do not display a qualitatively change across the
EP. To overcome this inconvenient, we propose to observe
the pseudo-Hermitian transition in the transient regime
and without the input signal.

The transient behavior can be probed in a ring-down
measurement at either the signal frequency or the idler
frequency. If we measure the intensity of these waves, then
the common term of the eigenvalues λ±, i.e., (∆s − ∆i)/2,
is eliminated. Therefore, |As,i(t)|2 display a beating fre-
quency |λ+ − λ−| = 2
rate 2κ in the pseudo-Hermitian phase, i.e., they are un-
derdamped [see Fig. 3(a)]. A unlikely exception is when
(As, A∗
i )T happens to be one eigenstate of H, then the
beating disappears and |As,i(t)|2 decay monotonically at
the rate 2κ.

In the broken pseudo-Hermitian phase close to the EP,
if (As, A∗

|As,i(t)|2 decay monotonically at the same rate given by
g2 − ¯∆2), where the sign is determined by the
eigenstate. Again this scenario is unlikely, and in general

pliﬁcation [see Fig. 3(b)]. This counter-intuitive feature
is a manifestation of the non-Hermicity of H and the
nonorthogonality of the two eigenstates [36]. After the

system has entered the broken pseudo-Hermitian phase.
If the system is deep in the pseudo-Hermitian phase, the

meaning that the signal wave and the idler wave are
generated and ampliﬁed without an input signal. This
is exactly where supercontinuum generation mentioned
in the introduction takes place, and the growth of the
generated waves stops when the pump becomes saturated.
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed and probed a pseudo-
Hermitian transition in degenerate FWM, which can be
described by a real-valued eﬀective Hamiltonian. The
intrinsic coherence in this nonlinear optical process dis-
tinguishes such a transition from that in PT -symmetric
systems: the latter is caused by an asymmetric spatial
proﬁle of the eigenstates, which concentrates in either the
gain part or the loss part of the system to exhibit an am-
plifying or decaying behavior. This behavior is classical in
nature, and the quantum coherence does not play a role.
In contrast, it is the total phase of the signal wave and the
idler wave that drives the pseudo-Hermitian transition
in degenerate FWM, which highlights the importance of
coherence in this process and opens the door to probe
quantum implications of exceptional points. This new
degree of freedom holds the promise of extending our
understanding of non-Hermitian physics in general, and
in a related work it was shown that a coherent coupling
in a PT -symmetric system can lead to an anomalous
PT -transition away from an exceptional point [37]. Ex-
