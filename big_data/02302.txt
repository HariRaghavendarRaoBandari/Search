Abstract
We present a new method to effectively select objects which may be low-mass active black
holes (BHs) at galaxy centers using high-cadence optical imaging data, and our ﬁrst spectro-
scopic identiﬁcation of an active 2.7 × 106 M⊙ BH at z = 0.164. This active BH was originally
selected due to its rapid optical variability, from a few hours to a day, based on Subaru Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) g-band imaging data taken with 1-hour cadence. Broad and narrow Hα
and many other emission lines are detected in our optical spectra taken with Subaru FOCAS,
and the BH mass is measured via the broad Hα emission line width (1,880 km s−1) and lu-
minosity (4.2 × 1040 erg s−1) after careful correction for the atmospheric absorption around
7,580-7,720 ˚A. We measure the Eddington ratio to be as low as 0.05, considerably smaller
than those in a previous SDSS sample with similar BH mass and redshift, which indicates one
of the strong potentials of our Subaru survey. The g − r color and morphology of the extended
component indicate that the host galaxy is a star-forming galaxy. We also show effectiveness

of our variability selection for low-mass active BHs.

1 Introduction

Wide-ﬁeld imaging and spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000), 2dF (Croom
et al. 2004), and subsequent surveys have led to the discovery
of a large number of quasars hosting active supermassive black
holes (SMBHs), i.e., active galactic nuclei (AGN), at their cen-
ters, even up to at a very high redshift (z∼ 7, e.g., Mortlock et al.
2011). While bright AGN populations with large SMBHs have
been discovered and studied in many ways over a wide range
of wavelengths, observational studies of lower-mass BHs have
been limited even in the local universe. Although every large
SMBH should have experienced a phase of growth from its seed
BH, an observational link between seed BHs and SMBHs has
been elusive. A simple way to approach this problem is a sur-
vey to ﬁnd such low-mass BHs. However, they are not easy to
identify simply because of their faintness (i.e., Eddington lumi-
nosity LEdd is proportional to a BH mass MBH, LEdd ∝ MBH;
see equation 1).

The huge number of the spectra taken in the SDSS project
(Greene & Ho 2007b; Dong et al. 2012) enable one to ﬁnd a
few hundreds of low-mass (< 2 × 106 M⊙ in their deﬁnitions)
active BHs at z < 0.35 by detailed ﬁtting of the galaxy spectra
(see also Greene & Ho 2004; Reines et al. 2013). Schramm et
al. (2013) searched for X-ray sources in less massive galaxies
with stellar masses of < 3 × 109 M⊙ at z < 1 utilizing optical-
to-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the deepest
X-ray data in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S; Xue et
al. 2011) and the Extended-CDF-S (Lehmer et al. 2005). They
found a 2 × 105 M⊙ BH at z = 0.131 based on the broad Hα
emission line and two more plausible ∼ 105 M⊙ BHs measured
from the stellar bulge masses. In the local universe, in addition
to the famous Seyfert 1 NGC 4395 with a 3.6 × 105 M⊙ BH
(Peterson et al. 2005) and other small BHs (Barth et al. 2004;
Reines et al. 2011; Reines & Deller 2012), Baldassare et al.
(2015) recently identiﬁed the smallest known active BH at a
galaxy’s center: a 5× 104 M⊙ active BH with a low luminosity
of Lbol = 4× 1040 erg s−1 and a low Eddington ratio of ∼ 0.01
in a nearby dwarf galaxy at z = 0.0243 (Reines et al. 2013).

In this paper, we introduce variability at optical wavelengths
as an effective method which enables us to select AGN with
lower BH masses, lower Eddington ratios, or at higher redshifts,
compared to those found in the SDSS dataset. AGN in general
show time variability all over the wavelength range. At UV-
optical wavelengths, emission from an accretion disk is variable
in time; this UV-optical variability has been (and will continue

to be) used as one of the effective methods to select Type-1
AGN in many studies (de Vries et al. 2005; Sarajedini et al.
2006; Cohen et al. 2006; Morokuma et al. 2008a; Barth et al.
2014; Choi et al. 2014). Considering the anti-correlation be-
tween luminosity and variability amplitude and the host galaxy
light contamination, the variability information would be use-
ful especially for lower-luminosity AGN if we could effectively
extract variable components.

First, we summarize our variability method in $2. We
describe our ﬁrst high-cadence imaging survey (SHOOT;
Tominaga et al. 2015c) and optical spectroscopic identiﬁcation
of a low-mass active BH candidate in $3. Measurements of
the black hole mass and the host galaxy properties are shown
in $4. We discuss the effectiveness of our method and sum-
marize the results in $5. We adopt the WMAP5 cosmological
model with (H0,ΩM ,ΩΛ) = (70.5,0.273,0.726) (Komatsu et al.
2009). Galactic extinction is Ag = 0.075 and Ar = 0.052 mag
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011) towards the AGN shown in this
paper.

2 Methodology for effective selection of

low-mass active black holes

UV-optical continuum emission of an accretion disk generally
shows variability in time. Variability information has been used
as an effective selection tool for quasars (e.g., Hawkins & Veron
1993).
It can be naively considered to be more effective for
fainter populations because of an empirical anti-correlation be-
tween luminosity and variability amplitude (Vanden Berk et al.
2004). The dynamical time scale of an accretion disk emitting
short-optical wavelength light, tdyn = (R(λ)3/GM )1/2, is as
short as a few days for 106 M⊙ BHs. Thus, we suggest

(i) rapid (< 1 day) optical variability information
(ii) at centers of galaxies
(iii) obtained with deep and wide imaging data

as an effective method to select
low-mass active BHs.
NGC 4395, with a 3.6 × 105 M⊙ BH, actually shows rapid (<
1 day) variability in UV wavelengths even though the Eddington
ratio is as low as ∼ 10−3 (Peterson et al. 2005). The timescale
of variability is an important parameter in the selection process.
Luminous AGN with larger BH masses, quasars, vary most
strongly over long intervals, from months to years; changes over
periods of hours are generally small. AGN with relativistic jets,
known as blazars, do show large variations on short time scales
and can be selected via variability in a short time scale (Bauer

et al. 2009; Ruan et al. 2012; Tanaka et al. 2014) however, since
they have a low number density (Ajello et al. 2012), and can be
recognized by their apparent compactness and an SED charac-
terized by synchrotron emission, they do not form a signiﬁcant
contaminant to samples of non-beamed AGN candidates show-
ing rapid variability.

This selection based on rapid variability is insensitive to red-
shift (since the time dilation effect only scales as (1 + z)) ex-
cept for inverse-square dimming with distance, which affects
any selection method.
In other words, variability on a short
time scale, unaccompanied by a relativistic jet, at any redshift,
suggests that the origin is a small accretion disk around a small
BH. Host galaxy contamination does not have much inﬂuence
on the variability detection because the sky is brighter than ob-
jects studied with 8-m class telescopes in optical imaging mode
and dominates the observational errors. On the other hand, other
methods such as classical color selection, selection of low mass
galaxies prior to X-ray selection, and spectral ﬁtting for a large
set of spectra, are affected by redshift and/or host galaxy con-
tamination because a different redshift assumed gives a different
rest-frame color and different stellar mass, and a blind search
for active BHs can be done in a limited redshift range.

3 Data & Analysis
3.1 Optical Transient Survey with Subaru Hyper

Suprime-Cam

We carried out HSC observations on July 2 (day 1) and 3 (day
2) in 2014 for a ﬁeld centered on (RA,Dec)=(16h32m12s.00,
+35d02’57”.1). We adopted 1-hour cadence for ﬁnding rapid
transients such as supernova shock breakouts (Tominaga et al.
2011; Tominaga et al. 2015c; Tanaka et al. 2016). In total, we
obtained g-band images for 3 and 3 epochs on the days 1 and
2, respectively. Each epoch image consists of 5 × 120 sec ex-
posures. The seeing was as good as 0.6 arcsec FWHM and the
typical limiting magnitudes (5σ) are about 26.0 mag.

The data was reduced with the standard HSC pipeline
hscPipe version 3.6.11, which is being developed based on the
LSST pipeline (Ivezic et al. 2008; Axelrod et al. 2010).
It
provides packages for bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding, astrome-
try, ﬂux calibration, mosaicing, warping, coadding, source de-
tection, and image subtraction. The astrometry and zeropoint
magnitude determination are made relative to the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 8 (DR8; Aihara et al. 2011) with a
1.18 arcsec (7 pixel) aperture radius. We developed a quick
image subtraction system with the pipeline and performed real-
time transient ﬁnding in cooperation with an on-site data analy-
sis system (Furusawa et al. 2011; Furusawa et al. 2015), which
enables us to make catalogs of variable and transient sources
right after observations (Tominaga et al. 2014a; Tominaga et al.

2014b; Tominaga et al. 2015a; Tominaga et al. 2015b). The
realtime image subtraction method was applied to the stacked
600-sec exposure data and transient and variable sources were
identiﬁed with the source detection code in hscPipe.

The image subtraction procedure was developed based on
the methodology shown in Alard & Lupton (1998) and Alard
(2000). With the hscPipe, all the HSC images are consistently
aligned with each other with common zeropoint magnitudes. In
the image subtraction procedure, point spread functions (PSFs)
are matched from the reference image to the search images The
image subtraction procedure is not perfect and sometimes pro-
vides artiﬁcial residuals in the subtracted images. One can judge
whether or not these residuals are real signals by measuring the
shapes of the residuals (matching the PSF shape with the residu-
als). In the case for the object shown in this paper, we conclude
that all the signals in the subtracted images are real.

With this 2-night imaging data, we found a rapidly vari-
able source at the center of an apparently small galaxy, at (RA,
Dec)=(16h33m56s.20, +35:13:39.3), which is a good candidate
of a low-mass BH. In addition to the discovery data, we took 1-
epoch (5×120 sec) r-band data on each night and g- and r-band
data on May 24, 2015. The HSC data properties and the light
curve of this object are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1.
We note that no radio or X-ray counterparts are detected in the
Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST;
White et al. 1997) or any of X-ray databases around this object,
respectively.

3.2 Follow-Up Observations with Subaru FOCAS
We took 1200 sec × 6 optical spectra of this object with Faint
Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS; Kashikawa et al.
2002) on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope on June 22, 2015. The slit-
mask was made for this region and each slit width was 1.0 arc-
sec. The position angle of the slits was 30 deg and the atmo-
spheric dispersion corrector was used. Seeing was stable and as
good as 0.5 arcsec FWHM. We adopted the 2 × 1 (spatial and
dispersion; 0.208 arcsec pixel−1 and 1.19 ˚A pixel−1) binning
mode. The ﬁrst three of the 6 exposures were taken with the
VPH850 grism and SO58 order-sort ﬁlter (giving λ > 5800 ˚A
spectrum) while the latter three were taken with the 300B grism
without any order-sort ﬁlters (giving 3500 < λ < 7000 ˚A spec-
trum without 2nd-order contamination). The nominal spectral
resolutions were R ∼ 600 and ∼ 400 for these two observing
modes, respectively. We note that the resulting spectral resolu-
tions (R ∼ 1, 200 and ∼ 800) were better than these speciﬁca-
tions because the image sizes were smaller than the slit widths.
Flux calibration was done using the standard star Feige 110
by utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope data (CALSPEC2).
The data reduction was carrired out ﬁrst in a standard manner

(Top): Original and subtracted images in g- and r-bands taken with HSC and FOCAS. The ﬁeld size is 100 × 100 HSC pixel corresponding to
16.9 × 16.9 arcsec2. North is up and east is left. The image subtraction is done for each image with the HSC image taken on May 24, 2015 being the
reference image in the both bands. The original pixel scale of FOCAS is different from that of HSC. We matched the FOCAS data to the HSC data on the WCS
basis only for this ﬁgure and the pixel scales of the images here are the same. (Bottom): The entire light curves in g- and r-bands are shown in the left panel
in blue and red circles, respectively. The r-band photometric point in the reference image (zero ﬂux) in the left panel is shifted by 10 days for readers to see
easily. These photometries are done in the subtracted images with references images taken on May 24, 2015. Light curves on Days 1 and 2 are magniﬁed in
the right panel.

without giving any special attention to the atmospheric absorp-
tion feature around 7,580-7,720 ˚A. This is partly because very
high-order polynomial ﬁtting is required to correctly evaluate
the transmission efﬁciency in this wavelength range; and, more
important, the standard star observation and object observation
were done separately in time at a different airmass. It would
be more accurate to use simultaneous observational data for
the correction, and so we subsequently corrected this absorp-
tion feature as described in §4.1.1. The reduced spectra before
the correction are shown in the top panel of Figure 2.

We also took 300-sec g-band imaging data in 2 × 2 bin-
ning mode (0.208 arcsec pixel−1), which enables us to cali-
brate the ﬂux more accurately. Image subtraction is applied to
these FOCAS image after matching the HSC reference image
to the FOCAS image because the pixel sampling of FOCAS is

larger than that of HSC. Photometry for the data is also shown
in Table 1 and Figure 1.

4 Measurements of Emission Lines, Black
Hole Mass, and Host Galaxy Properties
4.1 Measurements of Emission Line Fluxes and

Widths

In the FOCAS spectra, several emission lines are clearly de-
tected and the line identiﬁcation is secure. However, the Hα and
[NII] emission line region, which is the most important wave-
length region for our purpose, is unfortunately much affected
by the strong atmospheric absorption around 7, 580-7, 720 ˚A.
Therefore, we make a correction for this absorption and evalu-
ate the error it might cause in our measurement of the BH mass.

4.1.1 Atmospheric Absorption Correction
The sky was very clear and stable during the FOCAS observa-
tions, which was veriﬁed by the CFHT SkyProbe3. We consider
the sky transmission (absorption) uniform within the 6 arcmin
FOCAS ﬁeld-of-view.

In the slitmask, 1.0 arcsec slits were cut for a few stars as
well as for the target AGN. One of the stars in the same slit-
mask is a G-type star, based on the SDSS color and the FOCAS
spectrum, without any strong absorption or emission features
around the atmospheric absorption feature. We estimated the
absorption fraction by linearly (in the λ-fλ plane) ﬁtting the ad-
jacent continuum of the star spectrum (7550-7580 ˚A and 7750-
7800 ˚A) and divided the AGN spectrum by this fraction.

This procedure requires accurate and consistent wavelength

calibration between the star and AGN spectra. We examined the
positions of the star and AGN in the slits during the exposures.
We note that the data was taken at a relatively high elevation
and the change of the airmasses during the exposures was not
so large, from 1.05 to 1.24. We found the slitmask was well
aligned to every object and the difference of the positions to
the center of the slits is conservatively evaluated to be smaller
than 0.5 pixel, corresponding to 0.6 ˚A. Then, we iterated the
emission line ﬁtting (described in $4.1.2) by shifting the wave-
lengths of the reference star (−1.0 to +1.0 pixel; i.e., −1.2 ˚A to
+1.2 ˚A) and estimated a systematic error in the measurements
of emission line widths and ﬂuxes. We found that the effect of
the wavelength difference is smaller than the scatter of the BH
mass-to-Hα properties and does not affect our result very much.
The obtained systematic errors on the broad Hα width, luminos-

ity, and BH mass are about 10%, 10%, and 20%, respectively.
We note that the systematic error on the ﬁnal BH mass is smaller
than the equation used for calculating the BH mass from the Hα
properties. We below use the original AGN spectrum without
this artiﬁcial offset and show only the statistical errors.

4.1.2 Emission Line Measurements
We ﬁrst ﬁtted one [OI] and two [SII] emission lines after sub-
tracting the surrounding continuum and measured the central
wavelengths of the [OI]λ6300, [SII]λ6718, [SII]λ6731 lines as
shown in Table 2. The obtained redshift is z = 0.1643. The
measured widths (FWHMs) of the two [SII] lines are consis-
tent with each other and the spectral resolution for the target is
∼ 1, 200. This is also consistent with the fact that the seeing
was about 0.5 arcsec FWHM, half of the slit size.

Second, we ﬁtted the continuum of the absorption-corrected
spectrum around the Hα region with a linear regression line
(λ-fλ) to isolate the AGN emission lines. After subtract-
ing the continuum, we ﬁtted broad and narrow Hα and
two [NII] emission lines with four Gaussians simultaneously.
In this procedure, we ﬁxed the central wavelengths of the
two [NII] components and the narrow Hα component, and
ﬁxed their widths to be the same as those of the [SII]
lines. We also assume the theoretical [NII] line ﬂux ratio of
2.96 (=f([NII]λ6583)/f([NII]λ6548). The central wavelengths
of the narrow and broad Hα are also set to be the same. We
ﬁnally ﬁnd that the width and the ﬂux of the broad Hα are
1880± 120 km s−1 and (61.2± 3.1)× 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2, re-
spectively. All these were similarly done in the previous study
(Dong et al. 2012). The emission line properties measured are
summarized in Table 2.

In the 300B grism spectrum (3,500-7,000 ˚A), Hβ and
[OIII]λ4959, 5007 lines are signiﬁcantly detected and Hβ line
is in general useful for independent BH mass and extinction
measurements. For BH mass measurements, the width of broad
Hβ component and the monochromatic continuum luminosity
at 5,100 ˚A are required. However, the Hβ broad component is
not so strong as Hα, and the overall spectrum could be contam-
inated by the host galaxy continuum; moreover, the complex
FeII emission and estimation of the continuum ﬂux requires the
detailed modeling and ﬁtting of these two components, which
is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we here only
measure the ﬂuxes of these emission lines (Table 2) by sum-
ming the ﬂux instead of ﬁtting the lines to derive the ﬂux ratio
f ([OIII])/f(Hβ).

UV-optical variability is detected from this AGN and the
clear broad Hα and Hβ emission lines are also detected. These
facts indicate that the AGN UV-optical emission from the ac-
cretion disk does not suffer from heavy extinction. However,
we here estimate possible extinction originated from dust in
the host galaxy with the Balmer decrement method. As stated

in the above paragraph, the narrow Hβ emission line is not
clearly detected and the rough lower limit of the ﬂux ratio
f (Hα)/f (Hβ) > 5 for the narrow components is obtained.
This ﬂux ratio is larger than that expected in the Case B re-
combination and that of the broad components of this object
(∼ 3.6) which is only slightly larger than the median value of
3.06 for type-1 AGN (Dong et al. 2008). Assuming the Calzetti
extinction law (Calzetti et al. 2000), we estimated dust extinc-
tion of A(Hα, narrow) >
∼ 3.5) and
A(Hα, broad) ∼ 0.6 mag (a factor of ∼ 1.7) at the Hα wave-
length, which corresponds to a possible BH mass underestima-
tion by a factor of >
∼ 1.9 and ∼ 1.3, for the narrow and broad
components, respectively.

∼ 1.4 mag (a factor of >

4.1.3 Black Hole Mass Measurements
Hα width (FWHM) and luminosity are often used for esti-
mating BH masses, especially for low-mass BHs (Greene &
Ho 2005; Dong et al. 2012; Schramm et al. 2013). We con-
vert the broad Hα luminosity and width to estimate the BH
mass by an equation (A1) in Greene & Ho (2007b), MBH =
(3.0+0.6

Based on the BH mass and Hα luminosity, we calculate the
Eddington ratio to be 0.046 by assuming a bolometric correction
of cbol = 9.8 (McLure & Dunlop 2004). We locate our object
in ﬁgures of apparent g-band total magnitude, apparent g − r
color without deblending, broad Hα width (FWHM), Hα lumi-
nosity, BH mass, and Eddington ratio, as a function of redshift
by comparing with the sample in Dong et al. 2012 (Figure 3).

A major limitation of the SDSS studies is the detec-
tion of broad Hα emission lines, which roughly corresponds
to a limit on the ﬂux of broad Hα lines, f (Hα) ≥ 5.2 ×
10−16 [erg s−1 cm−2] (Dong et al. 2012). This can be con-
verted to the limits of luminosity and width of Hα (L(Hα) and
FWHM(Hα)), bolometric luminosity (Lbol), and Eddington ra-
tio (LEdd/Lbol) given the deﬁnition (upper limit) of the BH
masses of 2 × 106 M⊙. These limits are shown in gray lines in
Figure 3. Our object has a slightly higher BH mass compared
to the SDSS studies and is close to the lower-end of the Hα lu-
minosity distribution, resulting in lower Eddington ratio, thanks

Figure 4 is a BPT diagram for our target and objects in Dong
et al. (2012). We note again that the [OI] and [SII] emission
lines can be more securely measured than the [NII] emission
lines. We locate two points for our object in each panel. We
also note that the ﬂux of the Hβ emission line is measured for
the entire Hβ emission line dominated by the broad component.
As shown in similar studies (e.g., Schramm et al. 2013), the lo-
cation of our object indicates these elements are dominantly ex-
cited by star forming activity rather than the AGN activity, or a
composite of star forming and low-ionization narrow emission-
line regions (LINER)-like activities, if one tries to classify ob-
jects without deblending emission lines into narrow and broad
components. This indicates that measurements of emission line
ratios do not work for selecting our object. On the other hand,
two-thirds of the objects in the sample of Dong et al. (2012) are
located at the Seyfert regions as shown in Figure 4.

4.2 Host Galaxy Properties

We measure the radial proﬁle of the host galaxy with GALFIT
(Peng et al. 2010). The ﬁtting was done for the HSC images in
all the epochs in g- and r-bands with masks covering a northern
star, an eastern star, and an east-south extended source, close to
the target. We note that the emission line contributions are small
according to the spectra (Figure 2). We ﬁt the images with a
PSF at the position of the AGN (galaxy center) and an extended
component with a S´ersic proﬁle of S´ersic index n (S´ersic 1963).
The ﬁtting results are all well done (reduced χ2 ∼ 1) and
nicely consistent in all the epochs. A half-light radius is re =
3.5− 4.0 pixel (∼ 2 kpc) and S´ersic index is n = 0.5− 1.0 with
measurement errors of about 0.5 pixel and 0.1, respectively. The
g- and r-band magnitudes of the S´ersic (extended) component
are 21.6±0.2 mag and 20.7±0.1 mag, respectively, giving g−r
color of about 0.9. The axis ratios and the position angles are
0.80 ± 0.05 and 15 ± 10 degrees, respectively.

The morphological

information indicates that

the host
galaxy is a disk galaxy. Based on a recent study on galaxy
morphologies by Lange et al. (2015), the S´ersic index and
size of the galaxy indicate that the host galaxy stellar mass is
about 109 M⊙ although the intrinsic scatter is large. This stel-
lar mass is within the scatter of the BH-to-total mass ratio for
2.7× 106 M⊙ objects shown in Reines et al. (2015). In the pre-
vious SDSS studies (Greene & Ho 2007a; Dong et al. 2012),
although it is difﬁcult to examine the morphology of the host
galaxies with the image quality of the SDSS data, the measured
g − r colors of the host galaxies are somewhat red but still con-
sistent with colors of disk galaxies. (Greene & Ho 2007a; Dong
et al. 2012). The g − r color of the host galaxy of our object
is redder than the median values in those papers but still within

the range of their g − r colors.

5 Discussion & Summary
We selected a low-mass active BH candidate through short-
time scale variability selection based on 1-hour-cadence imag-
ing data with Subaru HSC, and spectroscopically determined
that the object hosts an active BH, the mass of which we ﬁnd
to be 2.7 × 106 M⊙ based on the Hα emission line after care-
ful correction of the spectrum. This object is located at a rel-
atively low redshift, within the redshift range probed by the
SDSS dataset (Greene & Ho 2005; Dong et al. 2012). Our ob-
ject is relatively bright in our HSC data and almost at the faint-
end limit of the SDSS data. Compared with the SDSS samples,
the Hα width is broader and the Hα luminosity is as small as
those of the faintest SDSS objects as shown in Figure 3. The
obtained BH mass is slightly above the upper end of those two
previous studies (because of their mass criteria for low-mass
BHs).

Our method is observationally limited solely by variability
detection. If we assume that variability amplitude is constant
over wide ranges of BH mass and Eddington ratio, variability
amplitude is expected to be proportional to AGN luminosity,
which is the product of BH mass and Eddington ratio, as de-
scribed in equation 1, where fvari and cbol are variability ampli-
tude and bolometric correction, respectively.

where LEdd = 4πGcmpM/σe = 1.26 × 1038(M/M⊙) [erg s−1]

By roughly assuming fvari = 0.1 (10%) (Vanden Berk et al.
2004), variability amplitude deﬁned as magnitude of differen-
tial ﬂux in subtracted images4 can be calculated as a function of
redshift. For a low-mass active BH at z = 0.164, the total ﬂux
including the host galaxy component is about 15 µJy and the
AGN component is a third of the total ﬂux: about 5 µJy. The
variability amplitude from hours to a day is about 10%, while
that at time scales longer than a day is larger than 20%. We here
assume that the power-law index of AGN spectra (fν ∝ ν αν ) is
αν = −0.44 (Vanden Berk et al. 2001). We also assume g-band
HSC observations with a typical depth in a 10 minute exposure
of g ∼ 26 mag. In this case, variability detection can go down
to gvari ∼ 25.6 mag, which is shallower than the original im-
ages by a factor of √2. This is because we need to investigate
intranight variability, not variability relative to deep reference
images. Under these assumptions, we can calculate the BH
mass range from which we can detect variability as shown in
Figure 5.

In the SDSS studies, the optical wavelength range and depths

total AGN ﬂux requires AGN+galaxy decomposition with a certain method.

(r < 17.77 for the spectroscopic sample described in Strauss et
al. 2002 and r ∼ 20 for some deeper speciﬁc samples) limit
the redshift (z < 0.352 for Hα; Greene & Ho 2007b; Dong et
al. 2012) and brightness ranges. Figure 5 indicates that our
variability survey can ﬁnd smaller active BHs at higher red-
shifts than the SDSS although AGN variability amplitude is
not so large that it is more difﬁcult to detect the variability
than the objects themselves. The Prime Focus Spectrograph
(PFS; Takada et al. 2014), to be attached to the 8.2-m Subaru
telescope in near future, will achieve a wider wavelength cov-
erage, up to J-band, 1.26 µm, corresponding to the limit of
Hα detection at z ∼ 0.85, and deeper spectroscopic capabil-
ity. Compared to these two large spectroscopic surveys, which
naively require blind galaxy spectroscopic observations, our se-
lection based on multi-epoch imaging data over one or a few
nights is less expensive. Since in the blind spectroscopic SDSS
surveys, the low-mass active BH (< 2 × 106 M⊙) fraction is
as small as 0.03% (174/544, 127; Greene & Ho 2007a; Greene
& Ho 2007b) and 0.07% (309/451,000; Dong et al. 2012), our
HSC survey has the advantage of effectively selecting low-mass
active BH candidates as spectroscopic targets. For example,
given these low success rates of the blind spectroscopic surveys
and the number of ﬁbers of PFS (2,400), one ﬁber is acciden-
tally assigned to a low-mass active BH on average but the ex-
pected number density of these populations is larger based on
the number density shown in the previous SDSS study (Greene
& Ho 2007b). In our current dataset, we have photometrically
detected short timescale variability from an order of ten candi-
dates per HSC ﬁeld-of-view, whose nature should be examined
with spectroscopic data.

The sample size will be enhanced by larger HSC surveys
and coming LSST survey. Low-mass active BH candidates se-
lected based on our method will be good candidates for sys-
tematic spectroscopic observations with PFS. This variability
method basically has no redshift limitation except for the effect
of Lyman break and brightness, although AGN identiﬁcation
and BH mass measurements in spectroscopic observations with
current facilities might limit the capability of our method. This
will be improved in the era of 30-m class telescopes.
