n-TRANSITIVITY OF BISECTION GROUPS OF A LIE

GROUPOID

TOMASZ RYBICKI

Abstract. The notion of n-transitivity can be carried over from groups of
diﬀeomorphisms on a manifold M to groups of bisections of a Lie groupoid
over M . The main theorem states that the n-transitivity is fulﬁlled for all
n ∈ N by an arbitrary group of C r-bisections of a Lie groupoid Γ of class
C r, where 1 ≤ r ≤ ω, under mild conditions. For instance, the group of all
bisections of any Lie groupoid and the group of all Lagrangian bisections
of any symplectic groupoid are n-transitive in the sense of this theorem. In
particular, if Γ is source connected for any arrow γ ∈ Γ there is a bisection
passing through γ.

1. Introduction

We say that a diﬀeomorphism group G ⊆ Diﬀ r(M) on a C r-manifold M,
where 1 ≤ r ≤ ω, is n-transitive if for any couple of pairwise distinct n-tuples
(x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ M n there exists f ∈ G such that f (xi) = yi for
i = 1, . . . , n.
It was probably ﬁrst observed by Milnor [7] that the group
Diﬀ ∞(M) is n-transitive for all n ∈ N, provided dim(M) ≥ 2. This re-
sult was generalized by Boothby [1] for classical groups of diﬀeomorphisms.
Next Michor and Vizman [8] proved analogues of the previous results for the
real-analytic case r = ω (see also [5]). Finally, by using the notion of gen-
eralized foliation, the problem of n-transitivity was solved in a more general
context in [10], which encompasses also non-transitive diﬀeomorphism groups.
Namely, the main result in [10] states that under a natural assumption (local-
ity) any diﬀeomorphism group is pseudo-n-transitive, which means that the
n-transitivity holds on each group orbit simultaneously.

The concept of a Lie groupoid generalizes Lie groups and applies to situa-
tions where, compared to the group theory, there is a lack of some symmetries
([6]). However, important features of Lie theory can be carried over to Lie

groupoids, e.g. basic integrability theorems. This enables to preserve impor-
tant methods and results of Lie theory in the groupoid case. On the other
hand, the notion of Lie groupoid comprises or describes many basic notions of
diﬀerential geometry such as manifolds, Lie groups, vector bundles, foliations,
homotopy, monodromy, Lie group actions, gauge transformations and others.
Given a Lie groupoid Γ = (Γ ⇒ M, α, β), where M is the space of units,
α is the source map and β is the target map, a bisection of Γ is a smooth
map σ : M → Γ such that α ◦ σ = idM and β ◦ σ is a diﬀeomorphism of M.
Bisections of a Lie groupoid can be regarded as its automorphisms. According
to the Ehresmann’s point of view to groups in geometry the bisection groups
play in it a fundamental role (see [4]).

We may generalize the notion of n-transitivity for Lie groupoids in the
following way. A bisection group G of Γ is said to be n-transitive if for any
two pointwise distinct n-tuples (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n and (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ Γn with
α(γi) = xi for all i and with β(γi) 6= β(γj) for all i 6= j, there exists a bisection
σ ∈ G such that σ(xi) = γi for all i.

In the case of the pair groupoid over a manifold M the bisections of Γ =
M × M are identiﬁed with the diﬀeomorphisms of M, and in this case the
above deﬁnition coincides with that for diﬀeomorphism groups. An interesting
question arises under what conditions a bisection group of a Lie groupoid is
n-transitive. This question was answered in the aﬃrmative by Chen, Liu and
Zhong in [2] under some conditions. In the present paper we would like to
generalize theorems from [2] in several aspects. Firstly we do not assume
that that Γ is transitive and we consider also the case when the ﬁbers of Γ
have dimension one. Next, we neither assume that the bisection group in
question consists of all bisections, nor that it acts transitively on α-ﬁbers
(Theorem 3.3). In particular, we obtain n-transitivity results for the group of
Lagrangian bisections of a symplectic groupoid. Finally, since our method of
the proof is completely diﬀerent from that of [2], our theorems also hold in
the real-analytic case.

Let Bisr(Γ) be the group of all bisections of a Lie groupoid Γ of class C r,
where 1 ≤ r ≤ ω. Let G ≤ Bisr(Γ) be an arbitrary subgroup of Bisr(Γ). The
symbol G0 will stand for the totality of σ ∈ G such that there exists a C r-
isotopy {σt}t∈R in G with σ0 = id and σ1 = σ. Observe that G0 is the identity
component of G if G is locally contractible. This is the case of Bis∞(Γ) for
every Lie groupoid Γ, since it was proved in [11] and [13] that Bis∞(Γ) is a
Lie group modeled on the space of sections of the Lie algebroid A(Γ) of Γ.
Likewise, in view of [12] we know that for every symplectic groupoid (Γ, Ω)
the group Bis(Γ, Ω) of all Lagrangian bisections of (Γ, Ω) is also a Lie group.

By IG we will denote the totality of C r-mappings

σ : R × M ∋ (t, x) 7→ σt(x) = σ(t, x) ∈ Γ

2

such that for all t the mapping σt : x 7→ σ(t, x) is an element of G, and σ0 = id.
In other words, IG is the group of all isotopies in G starting at the identity.

Let us formulate the (L)-condition (locality) for G.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A bisection subgroup G ≤ Bisr(Γ) satisﬁes (L)-condition,
where 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. r = ω), if for all open, relatively compact sets
U, V ⊆ M with U ⊆ V , and a C r-isotopy σ ∈ IG, there is a C r-isotopy τ ∈ IG
in G with τt = σt on U and supp(τt) ⊆ V (resp. τt is suﬃciently C 1 close to σt
on U and τt is suﬃciently C 1 close to the inclusion map ιM : M → Γ outside
V ).

Another concept that will be of use is the ﬁberwise transitivity.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A group G ≤ Bis(Γ) is said to be ﬁberwise transitive if for
every x ∈ M there are k isotopies σ1, . . . , σk ∈ IG, where k = dim α−1(x),
such that

(1.1)

are linearly independent.

= ˙σ1(x)|t=0, . . . ,

∂σk
∂t

(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

= ˙σk(x)|t=0

Let V ⊆ M be an open subset. By GV we denote all σ ∈ G with supp(σ) ⊆
V , and by IGV the totality of σ ∈ IG with supp(σt) ⊆ V for all t. Next, we
put Γx = α−1(x) and denote by Γo
x the connected component of x in Γx. Let
x is open in Γx and Γo is an open subgroupoid of
U = Γo ∩ α−1(U). We will also use the notation: for

Γ. For any U ⊆ M let Γo
n ∈ N and for a pairwise distinct n-tuple (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n we set
(1.2)

Γo = Sx∈M Γo

x. Note that Γo

R(x1, . . . , xn) = {(γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ Γo

x1 × · · · × Γo

xn| (∀i 6= j), β(γi) 6= β(γj)}.

Finally, let FΓ be the generalized foliation on M determined by Γ (see [6]).
Given (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n we denote by Li = β(Γo
xi) the leaf of FΓ passing
through xi.

Our ﬁrst result concerning n-transitivity is the following

Theorem 1.3. Let 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. r = ω). Suppose that a bisection
group G ≤ Bisr(Γ) satisﬁes (L)-condition and is ﬁberwise transitive. Let
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n be a pairwise distinct n-tuple. Assume, in addition, that
for i = 1, . . . , n either dim(Li) ≥ 2, or xj 6∈ Li for all j 6= i. Then for any
(γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn) and for any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is an open
neighborhood of Li in M, there exists σ ∈ G such that σ(xi) = γi for each i
and supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn (resp. β ◦ σ is suﬃciently C 1 close to the
inclusion ιM on M \ (V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn)).

If Li = Lj we may take Vi = Vj.

3

The proof will be presented in the next section. A stronger version of the
above theorem with no assumption that G is ﬁberwise transitive will be proved
in section 3.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.3 we have

Corollary 1.4. Under the above assumptions on G and (x1, . . . , xn), suppose
(y1, . . . , yn) ∈ M n is a pairwise distinct n-tuple such that xi, yi belong to the
same leaf Li. Then for any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is an open neighborhood
of the leaf Li, there exists σ ∈ G such that β(σ(xi)) = yi and supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆
V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn for 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. β ◦ σ is suﬃciently C 1 close to ιM on
M \ (V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn) for r = ω).

Also this corollary will be given in a more general form in section 3. Another

easy consequence is the existence of bisection through a given arrow.

Corollary 1.5. Under the above assumptions on G, for any γ ∈ Γo there is
σ ∈ G such that σ(α(γ)) = γ. Moreover, β ◦ σ can be supported in a suﬃcienly
small neighborhood V of the leaf Lα(γ) for 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. β ◦σ is suﬃciently
C 1 close to ιM on M \ V for r = ω).

We will show in section 3 that the ﬁberwise transitivity of G can be omitted.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.3

We start with some auxiliary result.

Lemma 2.1. Let N be a connected manifold and E ⊆ N be a subset being a
ﬁnite union E = E1∪. . .∪El of submanifolds Ei of codimension d ≥ 2 such that
s=1 Eis is a submanifold of

for each {i1, . . . , ik} ⊆ {1, . . . , l} the intersection Tk

any Eis of codimension > d. Then N \ E is also connected.

Proof. Take x, y ∈ N \ E.Since N is a connected manifold, ﬁnd a simple curve
c : [0, 1] → N such that c(0) = x and c(1) = y. Then c([0, 1]) ∩ E consists of
a ﬁnite number of points and closed intervals. Perform a small perturbation
near each of the intersection point or interval (in the latter case by using
a ﬁnite cover of the intersection by chart domains) to obtain another curve
¯c : [0, 1] → N homotopic rel. endpoints to c, which has the image disjoint
with E. It is possible thanks to the assumption that d ≥ 2. Thus any two
points in N \ E can be joined by a curve with image in N \ E. This shows
that N \ E is connected.
(cid:3)

Let (x1, . . . , xn) be an n-tuple of pairwise distinct points and V1 ×· · ·×Vn ⊆
M n be an open neighborhood of L1 × · · · × Ln. Here we may and do assume
that Vi ∩ Vj = ∅ for i 6= j. Set

S(x1, . . . , xn) = {(γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ Γn| (∃σ ∈ G) σ(xi) = γi, i = 1, . . . , n},

4

and observe that in view of the deﬁnition of bisection

S(x1, . . . , xn) ⊆ R(x1, . . . , xn),

where the set R(x1, . . . , xn) is given by (1.2). We wish to show that R(x1, . . . , xn)
is a connected subset of Γo

x1 × · · · × Γo

xn.

Note that, after permuting indexes, the set R(x1, . . . , xn) can be written in

the form

R(x1, . . . , xn) = R(x1, . . . , xk1) × R(xk1+1, . . . , xk2) × · · · × R(xkl−1+1, . . . , xkl)
with l, ks ∈ N (1 ≤ s ≤ l) and k1 + · · · kl = n, such that Li = Lj iﬀ ks−1 <
i ≤ j ≤ ks for some s (here k0 = 0), for all Li, Lj ∈ FΓ. Clearly, R(x) = Γo
x is
connected by assumption. Therefore it suﬃces to show that R(x1, . . . , xk) is
connected when L1 = . . . = Lk =: L and dim(L) ≥ 2.

In fact, the target projection β induces a surjective submersion

˜β : Γo

x1 × · · · × Γo

xk → L × · · · × L

and

R(x1, . . . , xk) = Γo

x1 × · · · × Γo

xk \ ˜β −1(∆),

where ∆ = {(y1, . . . , yk) ∈ Lk| (∃i 6= j), yi = yj}. Since the set ∆ has codi-
mension equal to dim(L) in Ln, then so has ˜β −1(∆) in Γo
xk. Thus,
xk and E = ˜β −1(∆), the set
in view of Lemma 2.1 with N = Γo
R(x1, . . . , xk) is connected. It follows that R(x1, . . . , xn) is also connected as
a product of connected sets.

Denote ki = dim(Γxi) for i = 1, . . . , n, and assume the existence of bisection

isotopies σi1, . . . , σiki ∈ IG such that

(2.1)

˙σi1(xi)|t=0, . . . , ˙σiki(xi)|t=0

are linearly independent, according to (1.1). If dim(Γxi) = 0, i.e. Li = {xi},
we assume that xi 6∈ Vj for j 6= i. Moreover, in view of the (L)-condition for
1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. for r = ω) we can and do assume that supp(σij
t ) ⊆ Ui for
all i, j, t (resp. σij
is suﬃciently C 1-close to ιM outside Ui for all i, j, t) and
t
that Ui are so small that

The group multiplication in G is given by

For σ, τ ∈ IG and x ∈ M consider the mapping

and observe that, due to (2.2), supp(ˆσ(t1, . . . , tN )) ⊆ U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Un. It follows
that

(2.7)

supp(β ◦ ˆσ(t1, . . . , tN )) ⊆ V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vn

for any (t1, . . . , tN ),

provided 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞. Next, for r = ω, by a similar argument the map
β ◦ ˆσ(t1, . . . , tN ) is suﬃciently C 1-close to the inclusion ιM outside V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vn
for all (t1, . . . , tN ) ∈ RN . The mapping Φ is of class C r since α is a submersion
In the case 1 ≤
and, consequently, the ﬁbers are imbedded submanifolds.
r ≤ ∞ the Jacobian matrix Jac Φ(t1, . . . , tN )|t=0 of Φ at 0 is a block matrix
consisting of the sequences (2.1) due to (2.5). In the case r = ω the Jacobian
matrix Jac Φ(t1, . . . , tN )|t=0 is C 0-close to the matrix from the previous case.
Consequently, in each case the Jacobian of Φ is nonzero at 0 ∈ RN , and Φ
maps a neighborhood of 0 diﬀeomorphically onto an open neighborhood of
(x1, . . . , xn) in S(x1, . . . , xn).

The whole procedure may be repeated when (x1, . . . , xn) is replaced by an

n
i ⊆ M is an open neighborhood of β(γi) such

arbitrary an n-tuple (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ S(x1, . . . , xn), and if we take U ′

for j = 1, . . . , ki so that the vectors
˙σi1(β(γi))|t=0, . . . , ˙σiki(β(γi))|t=0

(2.9)

are linearly independent for all i. Then, similarly as before, we deﬁne

Φ(t1, . . . , tN ) = 


t1 ⋆ · · · ⋆ σ1k1


 .

Again, since the blocks (2.9) are linearly independent (here we use the
hypothesis that (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn) ), Φ is a diﬀeomorphism of an
open neighborhood of 0 ∈ RN onto an open neighborhood U of (γ1, . . . , γn) in
R(x1, . . . , xn). Thus we have proved that for every (¯γ1, . . . , ¯γn) ∈ U there is
σ ∈ Bisr(Γ) such that

(2.10)

σ(β(γi)).γi = ¯γi

for all i. Furthermore, the relation (γ1, . . . , γn) ∼ (¯γ1, . . . , ¯γn) in the set
R(x1, . . . , xn) deﬁned by (2.10) is transitive. Indeed, for σ, τ ∈ G satisfying
(2.10) and the equality

τ (β(¯γi)).¯γi = ˆγi

we have

(cid:0)τ ⋆ σ(β(γi))(cid:1).γi = (cid:0)τ (β(σ(β(γi)))).σ(β(γi))(cid:1).γi
= (cid:0)τ (β(σ(β(γi)).γi)).σ(β(γi)(cid:1).γi
= τ (β(¯γi)).(cid:0)σ(β(γi)).γi(cid:1)

= τ (β(¯γi)).¯γi = ˆγi.

Consequently, if (γ1, . . . , γn) ∼ (¯γ1, . . . , ¯γn) and (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ S(x1, . . . , xn)

then (¯γ1, . . . , ¯γn) ∈ S(x1, . . . , xn).

The relation ∼ is symmetric too.

In fact, for σ ∈ G verifying (2.10) we

obtain from (2.3) the symmetric relation

σ−1(β(¯γi)).¯γi = σ−1(cid:0)β(σ(β(γi)).γi)(cid:1).(cid:0)σ(β(γi)).γi(cid:1)
= σ−1(cid:0)β(σ(β(γi)))(cid:1).(cid:0)σ(β(γi)).γi(cid:1)
= σ(cid:0)(β ◦ σ)−1 ◦ (β ◦ σ)(β(γi))(cid:1)−1.(cid:0)σ(β(γi)).γi(cid:1)
= (cid:0)σ(β(γi))(cid:1)−1
= (cid:0)σ(β(γi))−1.σ(β(γi))(cid:1).γi = γi.

.(cid:0)σ(β(γi)).γi(cid:1)

In view of the transitivity and symmetry of the relation ∼, the sets S(x1, . . . , xn)
and R(x1, . . . , xn)\S(x1, . . . , xn) are both open in the connected set R(x1, . . . , xn).

7

Thus S(x1, . . . , xn) = R(x1, . . . , xn). That is, for each (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn)
there is a bisection ˜σ with ˜σ(xi) = γi.

Finally, we have to prove that supp(β ◦ ˜σ) ⊆ V1 × · · · × Vn in the case
1 ≤ r ≤ ∞. We proceed by induction on the number of factors of ˜σ of the
form (2.6). If there is only one such a factor, that is ˜σ = ˆσ(t1, . . . , tN ), then
we are done by (2.7). Suppose now that ˜σ = σ ⋆ τ , where σ = ˆσ(t1, . . . , tN ) as
in (2.6), and supp(β ◦ τ ) ⊆ V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vn by the induction assumption. Here
τ (xi) = γi and U ′
i is a neighborhood of γi such that (2.8) is fulﬁlled for all i.
Next, the bisections σij in the decomposition (2.6) satisfy σij ∈ IGU ′
for all
i, j. Therefore, in view of (2.2), supp(β ◦ ˜σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ · · · ∪ Vn, as required. A
similar inductive reasoning shows that ˜σ may be chosen suﬃciently C 1 close
to the inclusion ιM on M \ (V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn) for r = ω. The theorem follows.

3. The case when G is not fiberwise transitive

In this section we will generalize Theorem 1.3 by using the concept of gener-
alize foliations (which from now on will be called foliations) and some related
notions. In particular, we assign to any bisection group G ≤ Bisr(Γ) a foliation
on Γ denoted by FG.

Let 1 ≤ r ≤ ω and let L be a subset of a C r-manifold P endowed with
a C r-diﬀerentiable structure which makes it an immersed submanifold. Then
L is weakly imbedded if for any locally connected topological space N and a
continuous map f : N → P satisfying f (N) ⊂ L, the map f : N → L is
continuous as well. It follows that in this case such a diﬀerentiable structure
is unique. A foliation of class C r (cf. [14]) is a partition F of P into weakly
imbedded submanifolds, called leaves, such that the following condition holds.
If x belongs to a k-dimensional leaf, then there is a local chart (U, φ) with
φ(x) = 0, and φ(U) = V × W , where V is open in Rk, and W is open in Rn−k,
such that if L ∈ F then φ(L ∩ U) = V × l, where l = {w ∈ W |φ−1(0, w) ∈ L}.
A foliation is called regular if all leaves have the same dimension.

Deﬁnition 3.1. [14] A smooth mapping φ of a open subset of R × P into P
is said to be a C r-arrow, 1 ≤ r ≤ ω, if
(1) φ(t, ·) = φt is a local C r-diﬀeomorphism for each t, possibly with empty
domain,
(2) φ0 = id on its domain,
(3) dom(φt) ⊂ dom(φs) whenever 0 ≤ s < t.

Given an arbitrary set of arrows A, let A∗ be the totality of local diﬀeomor-
phisms ψ such that ψ = φ(t, ·) for some φ ∈ A, t ∈ R. Next ˆA denotes the set
consisting of all local diﬀeomorphisms being ﬁnite compositions of elements
from A∗ or (A∗)−1 = {ψ−1|ψ ∈ A∗}, and of the identity. Then the orbits of
ˆA are called accessible sets of A.

8

For x ∈ P let A(x), ¯A(x) be the vector subspaces of TxP generated by

{ ˙φ(t, y)|φ ∈ A, φt(y) = x},

{dyψ(v)|ψ ∈ ˆA, ψ(y) = x, v ∈ A(y)},

resp. Then we have ([14])

Theorem 3.2. Let A be an arbitrary set of C r-arrows on P . Then

(1) every accessible set of A admits a (unique) C r-diﬀerentiable structure

of a connected weakly imbedded submanifold of P ;

(2) the collection of accessible sets forms a foliation F ; and
(3) D(F ) := { ¯A(x)} is the tangent distribution of F .

Now let G ≤ Bisr(Γ) be an isotopically connected group of bisections, i.e.
any σ ∈ G can be joined to the identity by a bisection isotopy starting with
idM . Let AG be the totality of restrictions of isotopies

R × Γ ∋ (t, γ) 7→ σt(β(γ)).γ ∈ Γ,

σ ∈ IG,

to open subsets of R × Γ in such a way that Deﬁnition 3.1 is fulﬁlled. Then
by FG we denote the foliation deﬁned by the set of arrows AG. Observe that
ˆAG = AG and, consequently,
(3.1)

¯AG(γ) = AG(γ).

Note that each leaf of FG is weakly imbedded submanifold of some α-ﬁber of
Γ.

Of course, any subgroup G ≤ Bisr(Γ) determines uniquely a foliation FG.

Namely, G deﬁnes uniquely a maximal isotopically connected subgroup G0.

It is well known that a Lie groupoid Γ ⇒ M induces a foliation on M,
denoted by FΓ, cf.
[6]. The leaves of FΓ are the images of the connected
components of the α-ﬁbers of Γ by the target projection β. Now let G ≤
Bisr(Γ) and denote by AM

G the collection of restrictions of isotopies

R × M ∋ (t, x) 7→ β(σt(x)) ∈ M,

σ ∈ IG,

to open subsets of R × M. Then Deﬁnition 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 apply. The
symbol F M
G . We also
have ˆAM

G stands for the foliation deﬁned by the set of arrows AM

G and ¯AM

G = AM

G (x) = AM

G (x).

Given (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n let Li be the leaf of F M

G passing through xi. We

put

RG(x1, . . . , xn) = {(γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn)| (∀i), β(γi) ∈ Li}.

Now we can formulate a generalization of Theorem 1.3.

Theorem 3.3. Suppose that G ≤ Bisr(Γ) satisﬁes (L)-condition (Deﬁnition
1.1), and let (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n be a pairwise distinct n-tuple. For any i =
1, . . . , n we assume that either dim(Li) ≥ 2, or xj 6∈ Li for all j 6= i. Then
for any (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ RG(x1, . . . , xn) and for any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is

9

an open neighborhood of Li in M, i = 1, . . . , n, there exists σ ∈ G such that
σ(xi) = γi for all i and supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn for 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. β ◦ σ
is suﬃciently C 1 close to ιM on M \ (V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn) for r = ω).

The proof of Theorem 3.3 is completely analogous to that of Theorem 1.3.
The only diﬀerence is that instead of ﬁberwise transitivity we apply the fact
that for any xi ∈ M there exist k isotopies σi1, . . . , σik ∈ IG such that

˙σi1(xi)|t=0, . . . , ˙σik(xi)|t=0

are linearly independent, where k = k(i) is the dimension of the leaf Pi ∈
FG passing through xi. In fact, this property is a consequence of Theorem
3.2(3) and the equality (3.1). Note that the leaves Pi are contained in the
M-component Γo of Γ.

As a consequence of Theorem 3.3 we get

Corollary 3.4. Suppose the hypotheses of Theorem 3.3 are fulﬁlled. Then for
any pairwise distinct n-tuple (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ M n such that xi and yi lie on the
same leaf Li ∈ F M
G and for any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is an open neighborhood
of Li in M, i = 1, . . . , n, there is σ ∈ G such that β(σ(xi)) = yi for all i and
supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn for 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp. β ◦ σ is suﬃciently C 1 close
to ιM on M \ (V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn) for r = ω).

Notice that Corollary 1.4 is a special case of Corollary 3.4.

Proof. Let Li ∈ F M
xi →
Li is surjective we choose (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn) such that β(γi) = yi for
all i. It suﬃces to apply Theorem 3.3.
(cid:3)

G be the leaf passing through xi and yi. Since β|Γo
xi

: Γo

We have the following improvement of Corollary 1.5.

Corollary 3.5. If G ≤ Bisr(Γ) satisﬁes (L)-condition, then for any γ ∈ Γo
there is σ ∈ G such that σ(α(γ)) = γ. Moreover, β ◦ σ can be supported in a
suﬃcienly small neighborhood V of the leaf Lα(γ) ∈ F M
G for 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞ (resp.
β ◦ σ is suﬃciently C 1 close to ι on M \ V for r = ω).

4. Regularity and the (L)-condition

In the remaining sections we conﬁne ourselves to the C ∞-class of smooth-
ness. However, by applying arguments similar to those from [8] the facts and
examples presented below hold in the real-analytic case.

Let Γ be a Lie groupoid and A(Γ) its Lie algebroid. Let Bis∞

c (Γ) desig-
nate the group of all compactly supported bisections of Γ. Next, denote by
Sectc(A(Γ)) the Lie algebra of all compactly supported sections of A(Γ), and
by I Sectc(A(Γ)) the space of all smooth curves R → Sectc(A(Γ)) (for the
calculus on locally convex spaces, see [5] or [9]). Note that to any bisection

10

isotopy σ ∈ I Bis∞
ing formula

c (Γ) we can assign X = {Xt} ∈ I Sectc(A(Γ)) by the follow-

(4.1)

Xt(x) = α∗(cid:18)∂αs

∂s

(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=t(cid:19) ,

x ∈ M.

It was shown in [11] or in [13] that the (right) evolution operator

Evolr

Bis∞(Γ) : I Sectc(A(Γ)) ∋ X 7→ σ ∈ I Bis∞

c (Γ)

determined by (4.1) is a bijection. Moreover, the mapping

evolr

Bis∞(Γ) : I Sectc(A(Γ)) ∋ X 7→ σ1 ∈ Bis∞(Γ)

is smooth. This means that the Lie group Bis∞

c (Γ) is regular.

More generally, we say that a subgroup G ≤ Bis∞

c (Γ) is regular if there exists
a closed Lie subalgebra L(G) ≤ Sectc(A(Γ)) such that deﬁning the evolution
operator for G as the restriction

Evolr

G = Evolr

Bis∞(Γ)(cid:12)(cid:12)IL(G),

where IL(G) stands for the space of all smooth maps R → L(G), we obtain
that the image of Evolr

G is in IG, such that the restricted operator

Evolr

G : IL(G) ∋ X 7→ σ ∈ IG

is a bijection. Here we do not assume that G carries a Lie group structure.

Proposition 4.1. Under the above assumption, let L(G) possess the property:
for any open subsets U, V ⊆ M with U ⊆ V and X ∈ IL(G) there exists
Y ∈ IL(G) such that Xt = Yt on U and supp(Yt) ⊆ V for all t. Then G obeys
(L)-condition.

The proof is straightforward.
Therefore we have

Corollary 4.2. For an arbitrary Lie groupoid Γ the group Bis∞
c (Γ) (and a
fortiori Bis∞(Γ)) fulﬁlls Theorem 1.3. In particular, for every γ ∈ Γo there is
σ ∈ Bis∞
c (Γ) with σ(α(γ)) = γ such that β ◦ σ is supported in an arbitrarily
small neighborhood of Lα(γ).

Proof. In view of Theorem 3.1 it suﬃces to show that Bis∞
c (Γ) is ﬁberwise
transitive. Let x ∈ M and k = dim(Γx). Take X1, . . . , Xk ∈ Sectc(A(Γ)) such
that X1(x), . . . , Xk(x) is a basis of Ax(Γ). Then exp(X1), . . . , exp(Xk) satisfy
Deﬁnition 1.2.
(cid:3)

5. Symplectic groupoids and Lagrangian bisections

Let us recall the notion of symplectic groupoid ([16], [3]).

Deﬁnition 5.1. A Lie groupoid Γ equipped with a symplectic form Ω is
called symplectic if the graph of multiplication m. graph(m), is a Lagrangian
submanifold of (−Γ) × Γ × Γ. Here −Γ denotes the symplectic manifold
(Γ, −Ω).

Then we have

Theorem 5.2. ([16], [3], [15]) If (Γ, Ω) is a symplectic groupoid then:

(1) The inversion i is an antisymplectomorphism (i.e. i∗Ω = −Ω), and M

is a Lagrangian submanifold of Γ.

(2) The foliations by ﬁbers of α and of β are Ω-orthogonal.
(3) The smooth functions on Γ constant on α-ﬁbers and the smooth func-

tions on Γ constant on β-ﬁbers commutes.

(4) The space of units M admits a natural Poisson structure Λ such that
α (resp. β) is a Poisson morphism (resp. anti-morphism) of (Γ, Ω)
onto the Poisson manifold (M, Λ).

(5) If Γ is α-connected the symplectic foliation FΛ of (M, Λ) coincides with

the foliation FΓ induced by the groupoid structure.
Such a groupoid is usually denoted by (Γ, Ω) ⇒ (M, Λ).

Now we need another deﬁnition of bisection, equivalent to the previous one.
A bisection of a Lie groupoid Γ is a submanifold B of Γ such that α|B and β|B
are diﬀeomorphisms of B onto M. The the set of bisections Bis(Γ) is endowed
the the following group product

(5.1)

B1.B2 = {γ1.γ2| (γ1, γ2) ∈ B1 × B2, α(γ1) = β(γ2)}.

Note that the equalities

σ = (α|B)−1, B = σ(M),

give a bijective correspondence σ 7→ B between the old and new notions of
bisection, and the group law (2.2) corresponds to (5.1). Observe that the set
of all Lagrangian bisections Bis(Γ, Ω) is a subgroup of Bis∞(Γ).

Example 5.3.

(1) The pair groupoid Γ = X × X with (−Ω) ⊕ Ω is a

symplectic groupoid. Then Bis(Γ, Ω) = Symp(X).

(2) If M is a manifold then T ∗M, where m is the addition in ﬁbers and
πM = α = β, is a Lie groupoid. T ∗M endowed with the canonical
symplectic form ΩM = −dλM is also a symplectic groupoid. In fact,
the graph of m

graph(m) = {(x3, x2, x1) : x1 + x2 − x3 = 0}.

12

This is the image of N ∆M , the normal bundle of the diagonal ∆M ⊆
M 3 in (T ∗M)3, into (T ∗M)3 by the mapping (x3, x2, x1) 7→ (−x3, x2, x1).
Notice that N ∆M is Lagrangian in (T ∗M)3, and the mapping is sym-
plectic. So T ∗M is indeed a symplectic groupoid.

Note that Bis(T ∗M, Ω) is the space of all closed 1-forms on M.

(3) Let Γ ⇒ M be a Lie groupoid. Then the cotangent space T ∗Γ equipped
with ΩΓ = −dλΓ carries a structure of symplectic groupoid with N ∗M,
the conormal bundle of M in Γ, being the space of units. Furthermore,
the canonical projection p : T ∗Γ → Γ is an epimorphism of groupoids.
(4) If G is a Lie group, T ∗G admits two symplectic groupoid structures.
First one is given as above, and the second is the structure of trans-
∗ by the coadjoint action. Since
formation groupoid, where G acts on g
these structures fulﬁll a compatibility condition, T ∗G carries a struc-
ture of double groupoid, cf. [3], [6].

Deﬁnition 5.4. A Lie algebroid (T ∗M, {, }, ρ) over M is called symplectic if
the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) the (2,0)-tensor Λ given by Λ(θ1, θ2) = θ2(ρ(θ1)), for all 1-forms θ1, θ2 on

M, is antisymmetric; and

(ii) the space of all closed 1-forms is a Lie subalgebra of (Sect(T ∗M), {, }).

Clearly there is a one-to-one correspondence between symplectic algebroids

over M and Poisson structures on M. Here ρ = Λ♯ and

{θ1, θ2} = ι(Λ♯(θ1)) d θ2 − ι(Λ♯(θ2)) d θ1 + d Λ(θ1, θ2).

Then we have (see [3], [6])

Proposition 5.5. If (Γ, Ω) ⇒ (M, Λ) is a symplectic groupoid then its associ-
ated algebroid A(Γ) is identiﬁed with (T ∗M, {, }, Λ♯), the symplectic algebroid
of (M, Λ). In particular, T ∗M ∼= T Γ|M /T M ∼= ker T β.

Now we can prove the n-transitivity property in the symplectic case.

Theorem 5.6. Let (Γ, Ω) ⇒ (M, Λ) be an arbitrary α-connected symplectic
groupoid. The group of Lagrangian bisections Bis(Γ, Ω) of (Γ, Ω) is n-transitive
for all n ∈ N. More precisely, let (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ M n be a pairwise distinct n-
tuple and let (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ R(x1, . . . , xn). For any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is
an open neighborhood of Li in M, i = 1, . . . , n, there exists σ ∈ Bis(Γ, Ω) such
that σ(xi) = γi for each i and supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn.

In particular, for any γ ∈ Γ there is σ ∈ Bis(Γ, Ω), with β ◦ σ supported in

an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the leaf Lα(γ), such that σ(α(γ)) = γ.

Proof. Since the leaves of FΓ are symplectic, the hypothesis on (γ1, . . . , γn) in
Theorem 1.3 is satisﬁed. In fact, we have either dim(Li) ≥ 2, or Li = {xi}. In
the latter case we assume xi 6∈ Vj for j 6= i. Concerning the assumptions on

13

G observe the following. In the proof of Theorem 1.3 in place of (L)-condition
and the ﬁberwise transitivity is only needed the following property:

(∗) For any x ∈ M and any U an open neighborhood of x in M there are
σ1, . . . , σk ∈ SectU (A(Γ)), where k = dim(Γx), and SectU denotes sections
supported in U, such that the equality (1.1) holds.

Note that in our situation dim(Γ) = 2k with dim(M) = k and dim(Γx) = k.
Obviously the condition (∗) holds for (Γ, Ω). Let (x1, . . . , xn) be an n-tuple of
pairwise distinct points and V1 × · · · × Vn ⊆ M n be an open neighborhood of
L1 × · · · × Ln. In view of (∗) we can ﬁnd smooth functions uij ∈ C∞(M, R),
where i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , k such that supp(uij) ⊆ Ui with β(Γo
Ui) ⊆ Vi for
all i, j, and the vector ﬁelds

are such that

X ij = Ω♯(d uij)

X i1(xi), . . . , X ik(xi)

constitutes a basis of Axi(Γ). Then we put σij = exp(X ij) and the rest of the
proof is the same as that of Theorem 1.3.
(cid:3)

Observe that for any σ ∈ Bis(Γ, Ω) the mapping M ∋ x 7→ (β ◦ σ)(x) ∈ M
is a Poisson diﬀeomorphism of (M, Λ). Analogously as for general groupoids,
but without the assumption on (x1, . . . , xn), we get

Corollary 5.7. Under the above assumption let (x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn) ∈
M n be pairwise distinct n-tuples such that xi, yi belong to the same leaf of the
foliation FΓ = FΛ on M. Then for any V1, . . . , Vn such that Vi is an open
neighborhood of the leaf Li ∈ FΓ, i = 1, . . . , n, there exists σ ∈ Bis(Γ, Ω)
such that the Poisson diﬀeomorphism β ◦ σ satisﬁes (β ◦ σ)(xi) = yi and
supp(β ◦ σ) ⊆ V1 ∪ . . . ∪ Vn.
