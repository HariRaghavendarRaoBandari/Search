Abstract. Let D+(K, t) denote the positive t-twisted double of K. For a ﬁxed integer-
valued additive concordance invariant ν that bounds the smooth four genus of a knot and
determines the smooth four genus of positive torus knots, Livingston and Naik deﬁned
tν (K) to be the greatest integer t such that ν(D+(K, t)) = 1. Let K1 and K2 be any knots
then we prove the following inequality : tν (K1) + tν (K2) ≤ tν (K1#K2) ≤ min(tν (K1) −
tν (−K2), tν (K2) − tν (−K1)). As an application we show that tτ (K) (cid:54)= ts(K) for inﬁnitely
many knots and that their diﬀerence can be arbitrarily large, where tτ (K) (respectively
ts(K)) is tν (K) when ν is Ozv´ath-Szab´o invariant τ (respectively when ν is normalized
Rasmussen s invariant).

Let ν be any integer-valued concordance invariant with the following properties:

1. Introduction

(1) additive under connected sum,
(2) |ν(K)| ≤ g4(K),
(3) ν(Tp,q) = (p − 1)(q − 1)/2 for p, q > 0.

Notice that the Ozv´ath-Szab´o invariant τ satisﬁes the above properties [OS03], as does the
Rasmussen s invariant when suitably normalized (i.e. when ν = −s/2) [Ras10]. Let D±(K, t)
denote the positive or negative t-twisted double of K. Then for a ﬁxed concordance invariant
ν, Livingston and Naik [LN06] show that ν(D+(K, t)) is always 1 or 0 (see Theorem 2.1)
and deﬁne tν(K) to be the greatest integer t such that ν(D+(K, t)) = 1. Specializing to τ
and s, we have the following two concordance invariants tτ (K) (respectively ts(K)) which
is the greatest integer t where τ (D+(K, t)) = 1 (respectively −s(D+(K, t))/2 = 1). Hedden
and Ording [HO08] show that there exist K for which tτ (K) (cid:54)= ts(K), in particular they
show that tτ (T2,2n+1) = 2n − 1 whereas ts(T2,3) ≥ 2, ts(T2,5) ≥ 5, and ts(T2,7) ≥ 8 (In fact,
it is easy to verity that ts(T2,3) = 2 and ts(T2,5) = 5 using Bar-Natan’s program [BN]).
This was the ﬁrst example known of a knot K for which τ (K) (cid:54)= −s(K)/2. (Note that it
is proven that τ (cid:54)= −s/2 even for topologically slice knots by Livingston, [Liv08].) Further
they make a remark that it would be reasonable to guess that ts(T2,2n+1) = 3n − 1, which
would imply that tτ (K) (cid:54)= ts(K) for inﬁnitely many diﬀerent knots. Also, Hedden [Hed07]
showed that tτ (K) does not give more information than τ (K):
Theorem 1.1. [Hed07, Theorem 1.5] tτ (K) = 2τ (K) − 1.

However, ts(K) is not well understood. In this paper we show the following inequality :

Theorem 1.2. Let K1 and K2 be any knots and ν be any integer-valued concordance in-
variant with properties (1), (2), and (3) as above then the following inequality hold:
tν(K1) + tν(K2) ≤ tν(K1#K2) ≤ min(tν(K1) − tν(−K2), tν(K2) − tν(−K1)).

We have the following as the immediate corollary:

Corollary 1.3. For any positive integer n, there exists a knot Kn such that

|tτ (Kn) − ts(Kn)| > n.

Proof. Let Kn be n connected sum of T2,5. Then by Theorem 1.2 and the fact that tτ (Kn) =
n· τ (T2,5)− 1 = 4n− 1 and ts(T2,5) ≥ 5 by Theorem 1.1 and [HO08], the result follows. (cid:3)

We end this section with the following remark:

Remark 1.4. If we assume that ts(K) is a polynomial of −s(K)/2 with integer coeﬃcients,
it is easy to verity that ts(K) = 3 · (−s(K)/2) − 1 using Theorem 1.2. Then in the light of
[HO08] it would be reasonable to guess that ts(K) = 3 · (−s(K)/2) − 1.

2. Proof of the Theorem 1.2

We will denote by T B(K) the maximum value of the Thurston-Bennequin number, taken
over all possible Legendrian representatives of K. Recall the following theorem from [LN06]:

Theorem 2.1. [LN06, Theorem 2] For each knot K there is an integer tν(K) such that:

1 for t ≤ tν(K),

(cid:26) 0 for t > tν(K)
(cid:26) −1 for t ≥ −tν(−K)

for t < −tν(−K),

0

ν(D+(K, t)) =

where tν(K) satisﬁes T B(K) ≤ tν(K) < −T B(−K).
A similar result holds for D−(K, t) using tν(−K):

ν(D−(K, t)) =

where tν(−K) satisﬁes T B(−K) ≤ tν(−K) < −T B(K).

Now, we are ready to prove the Theorem 1.2. The proof completely relies on Theorem

2.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let t1 and t2 be integers and consider D+(K1, t1)#D+(K2, t2) and
D+(K1#K2, t1 + t2). Then there is a genus one cobordism from D+(K1, t1)#D+(K2, t2)
to D+(K1#K2, t1 + t2) (see Figure 1). Hence if ν(D+(K1, t1)) = ν(D+(K2, t2)) = 1, then
ν(D+(K1#K2, t1 + t2)) = 1. Letting t1 = tν(K1) and t2 = tν(K2), we have ν(D+(K1, t1)) =
ν(D+(K2, t2)) = 1 by Theorem 2.1. Using Theorem 2.1 again we have tν(K1) + tν(K2) ≤
tν(K1#K2).

Using a similar argument, notice that there is a genus one cobordism from D+(K1, t1)#
D−(K2, t2) to D+(K1#K2, t1 + t2) by simply changing the sign of the clasp in Figure 1.
Therefore if ν(D+(K1, t1)) = 0 and ν(D−(K2, t2)) = −1, then ν(D+(K1#K2, t1 + t2)) = 0
by Theorem 2.1. Letting t1 = tν(K1) + 1 and t2 = −tν(−K2), we have ν(D+(K1, t1)) = 0
and ν(D−(K2, t2)) = −1 by Theorem 2.1. Using Theorem 2.1 again we have tν(K1) + 1 −
tν(−K2) ≥ tν(K1#K2) + 1, hence tν(K1#K2) ≤ tν(K1) − tν(−K2). Finally, by switching
roles of K1 and K2 we also get tν(K1#K2) ≤ tν(K2)− tν(−K1) which completes the proof.
