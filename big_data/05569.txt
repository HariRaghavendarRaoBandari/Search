KEY ISSUES REVIEW: NUMERICAL STUDIES OF TURBULENCE IN STARS

W. David Arnett1 and Casey Meakin1

Draft version March 18, 2016

ABSTRACT

The numerical simulation of turbulence in stars has led to a rich set of possibilities regarding
stellar pulsations, asteroseismology, thermonuclear yields, and formation of neutron stars and black
holes. The breaking of symmetry by turbulent ﬂow grows in amplitude as collapse is approached,
which insures that the conditions at the onset of collapse are not spherical. This lack of spherical
symmetry has important implications for the mechanism of explosion and ejected nucleosynthesis
products. Numerical resolution of several diﬀerent types of three–dimensional (3D) stellar simulations
are compared; it is suggested that core collapse simulations may be under-resolved. New physical
eﬀects which appear in 3D are summarized. Connections between simulations of progenitor explosion
and observations of supernova remnants (SNR) are discussed. Present treatment of boundaries, for
mixing regions during He–burning, requires revision.

1.

INTRODUCTION

Most of the history of the theory of stellar evolution
is based on the approximation that stars have spheri-
cal symmetry, and are quasi–static objects. This ﬂies
in the face of observations of the surface of the Sun,
as time–lapse videos2 of sunspots, eruptions and gran-
ulation show, so that the approximation must be stated
more carefully as spherically symmetric on average. The
Sun is a gravitationally–bound thermonuclear reactor,
made of plasma which exhibits turbulent convection in its
outer layers. Spherical symmetry on average arises from
the cancellation of eﬀects, from the combined action of
many chaotic ﬂuctuations such as those which the solar
videos capture. The fortunate approximations of spheri-
cal symmetry and quasi-static behavior allow the reduc-
tion of a three-dimensional (3D) time–dependent prob-
lem to a one dimensional (1D) quasi–static one, which is
amenable to numerical simulation by computer as ﬁfty
years or so of progress have shown.

Direct simulation of turbulent convection in stars is
now feasible, and permits a theoretical study of the solu-
tions to the 3D, time–dependent equations of ﬂuid ﬂow
in stars, and consequently a critical re-examination of
the spherical, quasi-static approximation for stellar evo-
lution.

2. METHODS

Table 1 summarizes the simulations (Meakin & Ar-
nett 2007b; Viallet, et al. 2013; Arnett, et al. 2015) upon
which this discussion is based. In 3D the turbulent cas-
cade moves from large to small scales, so the implicit
large–eddy simulation approach (ILES) of Boris (2007)
maximizes eﬀective use of computational resources. To
attain higher resolution a “box–in–star” grid conﬁgura-
tion is used, so that only a part of the star is simulated on
the grid. This gives a maximal numerical Reynolds num-
ber, and truly turbulent behavior using presently avail-
able computers, with the drawback that the limited size
of the box, being smaller than the star, does not support

the lowest order modes of motion. A resolution study (a
range of 8 in linear resolution, or 84 = 4096 in compu-
tational resources) suggests that the turbulent cascade
and the convective boundaries may be adequately cap-
tured (Arnett, et al. 2015). These simulations use realis-
tic microphysics for the equation of state (EOS), opacity,
nuclear reaction network (25 nuclei), and neutrino emis-
sion. The initial model was mapped from a well–resolved
1D stellar evolutionary model onto the 3D computational
grid. The residuals from conservation laws are monitored
to test both the use of the ILES approximation, and the
zoning in boundary layers (Viallet, et al. 2013; Arnett,
et al. 2015).

A number of other eﬀorts have contributed to our im-
proved understanding of 3D stellar convection. Herwig,
et al. (2014, 2011) have conducted 3D simulations of sim-
ilar resolution and character (on proton ingestion dur-
ing He ﬂash convection), using a “star–in–box” approach
(the entire star is enclosed by the computational grid, al-
lowing even the lowest order modes to be represented)3.
See earlier work in Porter & Woodward (1994); Porter et
al. (1999); Porter & Woodward (2000). Campbell, et al.
(2016a) show a “box–in–star” simulations of the upper
boundary of an 8 M(cid:12) star, which is a related ingestion
problem.

The earliest successes of 3D radiative hydrodynamics
were the pioneering simulations of the solar atmosphere
by Nordlund and Stein, which reproduced the observed
shapes of spectral lines without adjustable parameters.
See Nordlund (1985); Nordlund & Stein (2000); Nord-
lund, Stein, & Asplund (2009); Stein & Nordlund (1989,
1998); Magic, et al. (2013). These simulations were in
the “box–in–star” mode, and treated magnetic ﬁelds on
the grid in the MHD approximation, but contained no
composition gradients or nuclear burning. See Freytag,
Ludwig, & Steﬀan (1996); Ludwig et al. (1999); Frey-
tag, et al. (2012); Ludwig & Kucinskas (2012) for further

3 This is at the cost of requiring correspondingly greater compu-
tational resources; the grids were cubes of 7683, 11523 and 15363
cells. An improved numerical scheme was used to provide a higher
eﬀective resolution. The 15363 run required four days on Blue
Waters at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA). Also see Table 1 for comparison.

work on 3D stellar atmospheres.

Juri Toomre and collaborators had a diﬀerent focus, on
rotation and magnetic ﬁelds in the “star–in–box” mode,
developing the MHD anelastic code ASH (Massaguer et
al. 1984; Hurlburt, Toomre, & Massaguer 1984, 1986;
Cattaneo, et al. 1991; Brummell, Clune, & Toomre 2002;
Brun, Miesch & Toomre 2004; Brun & Palacios 2009;
Brun, Miesch & Toomre 2011; Miesch 2005; Miesch, et
al. 2008). See also the discussion concerning energy con-
servation4 in Brown, Vasil & Zweibel (2012); Vasil &
et al. (2013). These simulations used a simpliﬁed at-
mospheric boundary, and contained no composition gra-
dients or nuclear burning, but considered rotation and
magnetic ﬁelds in detail.

Adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) is an attempt to
attain better resolution with limited computational re-
sources; this has been implemented in several stellar as-
trophysics codes: the compressible hydrodynamics code
FLASH (Fryxell, et al. 2010), the low–Mach–number hy-
drodynamics code MAESTRO (Nonaka, et al. 2010), and
the compressible hydrodynamics code CASTRO (Alm-
gren, et al. 2010). The basic idea is to use ﬁne zoning
in regions where it is needed and coarser resolution else-
where. For this to be eﬀective there must be regions on
the grid in which little is happening, so the degree of
eﬀectivenes of AMR may depend upon the problem be-
ing tackled. For example, turbulence expands to ﬁll the
volume allowed, and be a broadly distributed, while in
contrast, nuclear burning is highly sensitive to tempera-
ture, and may be localized.

Extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental in-
formation from the geosciences has been analysed by
Canuto (2011a,b,c,d,e), for application to the problem
of stellar convection and mixing.

Given the variety in emphasis, resources, and interests,
these 3D simulations are strikingly consistent, which en-
courages this attempt to explore their implications.

3. RESULTS

Qualitatively new and previously overlooked behavior
appears in the simulations indicated in Table 1 and re-
ferred to in §2 above.
4 Residuals from conservation laws are useful diagnostics for res-
olution and consistency (Viallet, et al. 2013), which Miesch, et al.
(2008) also show to be an issue.

Fig. 1.— The time evolution of the radial proﬁle of contours
of turbulent speciﬁc kinetic energy is shown for the 3D oxygen
shell burning model, which illustrates the intermittent nature of
the convective motions, even in a quasi–steady state. The up-
welling chimney–like features in the convective region are seen to
excite internal wave trains in the stable layers, which can be seen
to propagate away from the boundaries of the convection zones.
Entrainment erodes both the top and bottom boundaries of con-
vection, so the convective region grows. After Meakin & Arnett
(2007b).

3.1. Dynamics

Stellar turbulent convection is a strikingly dynamic
process (Meakin & Arnett 2007b). This is indicated
in Fig. 1, which shows the dynamic onset of convection
from a carefully zoned 1D initial model mapped to a 3D
grid. Because of the inadequacy of present algorithms
for 1D turbulent convection, there is always an initial
transient in which convective ﬂow is established. This is
followed by bursts of turbulent kinetic energy, recurring
on a time interval similar to the time needed to tran-
sit the convective layer. These bursts encounter stable
layers, and drive wave motions (predominantly gravity
modes) from both boundaries, most obviously from the
top. The boundaries are eroded by entrainment. Both
the rate of entrainment, and the amplitude of the waves,
are aﬀected by the stiﬀness of the stable layer (the value
of the Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a frequency), and are not some uni-
versal constant. The behavior is also modiﬁed by ra-
diative eﬀects, as shown by comparison of the oxygen–
burning shell (OB) and the lower boundary of the sur-
face convection zone of a red giant (RG) in Viallet, et
al. (2013), which have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent values of the
P`eclet number (Viallet, et al. 2015).

3.2. Reynolds–averaged Navier-Stokes equations

At present the highest resolution grids have ∼ 109 grid
points, which for a 25-nucleus network implies a stor-
age requirement of ∼ 3 × 1011 individual numbers per
timestep. The challenge is to abstract the essential fea-
tures from this ﬂood of data. The Reynolds-averaged
Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations provide a systematic
way to condense the data and to provide insight for
the development of approximate equations to describe it
(Moc´ak, et al. 2014). Two powerful features of this for-
mulation are that it allows a quantitative evaluation of
the sub–grid dissipation, and it explicitly allows the iden-
tiﬁcation of errors due to inadequate resolution (Viallet,
et al. 2013). The latter is particularly useful in assess-
ing the numerical quality of simulations of boundaries
between turbulent and non-turbulent regions.

3.3. Kolmogorov cascade

There is a balance, on average, between buoyancy and
turbulent dissipation (Arnett, Meakin & Young 2009; Ar-
nett & Meakin 2011). Buoyancy occurs as a radial ac-
celeration at the largest scales. At the large Reynolds
numbers typical of stars, the motion is unstable and
breaks–up into smaller scale motion, becoming isotropic
and losing its 1D character. This continues until the Kol-
mogorov scale is reached, at which point dissipative pro-
cesses can damp the motion. For these ILES simulations
this damping occurs at the sub–grid scale. With suﬃ-
cient resolution (e.g., see Table 1, Herwig, et al. (2014);
Nonaka, et al. (2012)), the turbulent cascade is reason-
ably well approximated.

3.4. Lorenz convective roll

The largest scale (the integral scale) behaves like the
convective roll of Lorenz (1963), which is a classic ex-
ample of a dynamic system with a strange attractor and
chaotic behavior (Manneville 2010). A combination of
the Lorenz model and the Kolmogorov cascade give a
simple but qualitatively consistent representation of the
3D simulation (Arnett, Meakin & Young 2009; Arnett
& Meakin 2011). The steady–state limit of this com-
bination gives the steady vortex model, from which the
mixing–length theory (MLT) cubic equation of B¨ohm-
Vitense (1958) can be derived (Smith & Arnett 2014), a
process which illustrates the strength and limitations of
MLT5.

3.5. Fluctuations and Rayleigh–Taylor Instability

If a steady–state constraint is not imposed, the balance
between buoyant driving and turbulent damping is not
satisﬁed instantaneously, but only on average. Because
driving and damping occur at widely diﬀerent length
scales, they are not synchronized in time, causing the
intermittent pulse behavior seen in Fig. 1. If the driving
is suﬃciently strong, an explosion may develop instead
of steady–state convection, with the rising plumes be-
coming Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) unstable and, depending
upon the structure, turbulent (Swisher, et al. 2015). Ex-
pansion causes a “freeze–out” of the motions (Abarzhi
2010) and of the compositional structure, tending toward
a spherical explosion (a Hubble ﬂow).

3.6. Turbulent Kinetic Energy Flux

Convective regions possess a basic up–down asymme-
try, which increases with stratiﬁcation.
In a hydro-
static stratiﬁcation, rising material expands because it
encounters decreasing pressure, and visa versa. To con-
serve mass, rising plumes will tend to be broader and
slower than descending plumes. This diﬀerence requires
a net downward ﬂux of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
(Meakin & Arnett 2010). This is pronounced in con-
vective atmospheres, which are strongly stratiﬁed, con-
taining many pressure scale heights. Net ﬂux of turbu-
lent kinetic energy is assumed to be zero in MLT, but
is nonzero and a prominent feature of 3D simulations of
stellar atmospheres (Nordlund & Stein 1995; Nordlund,
Stein, & Asplund 2009).

3.7. Boundary layers

A key feature of suﬃciently resolved 3D simulations
(Herwig, et al. 2014; Arnett, et al. 2015) is the develop-
ment of thin layers which separate regions of potential
ﬂow (non-turbulent) from those of solenoidal ﬂow (tur-
bulent). Because MLT is a local theory, it has no ability
to describe such boundaries. By convention this gap is
addressed by linear stability analysis, resulting in use of
the criteria of Schwarzschild (no composition gradient)
and Ledoux to deﬁne boundaries of mixing. In the geo-
sciences a more sophisticated analysis leads to various
versions of the Richardson criterion (see Turner (1973),
§10.2.3), which includes both the degree of convective
vigor and the stiﬀness of the stable region. The Richard-
son criterion is a ratio of the potential energy required
to mix a stably stratiﬁed layer, divided by the turbu-
lent kinetic energy available to do so. This preference
of a Richardson criterion for mixing is supported by the
simulations (§3.5, Arnett, et al. (2015)). The Ledoux
criterion only includes the eﬀects of a composition gra-
dient, but not convective vigor, and so underestimates
mixing6. This may be why the Schwarzschild criterion is
preferred over the Ledoux. The Schwarzschild criterion
ignores the inhibiting composition gradient term, is sim-
pler, and better agrees with astronomical observations.
Accurate estimates of both the composition gradient and
the convective speed are needed to deﬁne the true mixing
boundary.

3.8. Composition currents

The mixing of composition in the simulations is ad-
vective (Arnett, et al. 2015) rather than diﬀusion–like
(Eggleton 1972), and transport is dominated by the large
eddies. Rising and descending ﬂows have diﬀering com-
position, giving rise to composition currents. Mathemat-
ically this reduces the highest order spatial derivative by
one: the composition ﬂux is propotional to the compo-
sition, not its gradient.
In practice this may result in
a qualitatively similar diﬀerence operator in 1D (Arnett
& Meakin 2011), but caution is suggested in use of the
Eggleton algorithm. While it is robust and useful for
rough surveys, it may be inappropriate for more precise
use.
In particular, it may not be the best foundation
for introducing rotational eﬀects (Maeder 1999). A bet-

sion tend to develop stable composition gradients in stars.

ter approach might involve using the integral–scale ﬂows
and rotation directly (Balbus 2009; Miesch, et al. 2008).

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Increasing asymmetry approaching collapse

As indicated in §1, the validity of the spherically-
symmetric approximation for the Sun depends upon a
cancellation of eﬀects from many turbulent cells act-
ing incoherently. Neutrino emission reduces the thermal
time scale relative to the hydrodynamic time scale (the
sound travel time), so that it becomes computationally
easier7 to directly simulate the late stages of stellar evo-
lution (Arnett 1996).

As collapse is approached, temperature rises. Neutrino
cooling increases, balanced by increased heating from nu-
clear burning, which gives increased turbulent velocity
(Arnett 1996). The increased vigor of convection causes
increased ﬂuctuation amplitudes for density as well as
tangential velocity. The core is the least stratiﬁed part
of the star, so that the convective cells are larger and
fewer, giving a less smooth cancellation of chaotic be-
havior. As collapse is approached, the equation of state
(EOS) is softer (the adiabatic exponent Γ → 4/3), so
that radial restoring forces decrease, giving larger ampli-
tude ﬂuctuations.

This tendency for dynamic behavior was already indi-
cated in 2D simulations, (Baz`an & Arnett 1994, 1997a,b,
1998; Asida & Arnett 2000; Meakin & Arnett 2006; Ar-
nett & Meakin 2011). At present, pre-collapse progeni-
tor models have spherical symmetry, and no ﬂuctuations
or tangential velocities (e.g., Woosley & Weaver (1995);
Woosley, Heger, & Weaver (2002)). The simulations,
both 2D and 3D, show that these progenitor models rep-
resent an extreme and non–physical limiting case.

The problem of inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) is
similar to core collapse in that a compression by a large
factor (∼ 100) is involved (Remington, et al. 1999,
2000). Experiments show the extreme importance of
slight asymmetries in the initial state prior to compres-
sion; these can modify even the qualitative nature of the
ﬂow (Drake 2005; Lindl 1998), a feature shared with core
collapse (Couch & Ott 2013).

4.2. Precollapse dynamics

In addition to changes in shape, 3D simulations also
show signiﬁcant additional changes in time, which also
can aﬀect the evolution up to and into collapse. Waves
are generated at the convective boundaries (Fig. 1),
which give rise to entrainment and mass loss (Meakin &
Arnett 2007b). For the precollapse stages, these waves
may not have time to travel to the stellar surface, and
they may dissipate along the way. The mass loss may be
extensive (Quataert & Shiode 2013; Shiode & Quataert
2014), and the dynamics may even lead to eruptions prior
to collapse (Arnett & Meakin 2011), as suggested by ob-
servations of SNIIn (Smith & Arnett 2014). In order to
get “Type I” light curves for SNIbc supernovae, signiﬁ-
cant mass loss must occur prior to collapse (Arnett 1982);

7 Solar simulations may use “box-in-star” to avoid the slow ther-
mal relaxation time of the deep layers (Nordlund, Stein, & Asplund
2009), or simplify the outer boundary condition and use “sound-
prooﬁng” methods (Brown, Vasil & Zweibel 2012) to allow larger
time steps (Brun, Miesch & Toomre 2004).

wave–driven mass–loss and eruptions may be alternatives
to binary stripping (Arnett 1980).

The 3D morphology of silicon–burning (Couch, et al.
2015) changes from that of oxygen–burning, because the
time scale for nuclear burning approaches the turnover
time scale for convective ﬂow. The further evolution of
Si–burning to nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) in
a convection zone corresponds to a system having both
mechanical and thermodynamic degrees of freedom (see
Landau & Lifshitz (1969), §123), an unexplored8 theo-
retical aspect of the approach to collapse indicated by
3D simulations.

4.3. Implications for core–collapse simulations

Core collapse of a massive star leads to the formation of
a neutron star or a black hole, but the details of this pro-
cess have presented continuing diﬃculty9. Janka, et al.
(2016) have recently reviewed the physics of core–collapse
in 3D. Core collapse simulations add the calculation of
neutrino spectrum transport to the computational chal-
lenges already in 3D simulations of Arnett, et al. (2015);
Herwig, et al. (2014), and so cannot aﬀord equal reso-
lution. In addition, core collapse simulations require a
star–in–box approach (see §2); a full 4π geometry is nec-
essary. The Oak Ridge group used the CHIMERA code
with a 540× 1802 grid, and the Garching group used the
PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code with a 600 × 90 × 180
grid. If these were box-in-star simulations, they would
both correspond to the low–resolution examples in Ta-
ble 1. However, as star-in-box simulations, they corre-
spond to a resolution still coarser by roughly a factor
∼ 4 × 8 = 32, as only 1/32 of the stellar volume needed
to be simulated in the box–in–star case, with a compa-
rable number of zones. The star–in–box simulation of
Herwig, et al. (2014) used a grid of 15363 points and a
reﬁned numerical algorithm to improve resolution (see
their appendix).
For comparison, Stein & Nordlund (1998) used grids
of 1252 × 82 and 2532 × 163 for satifactory resolution
of the solar atmosphere, but in the box–in–star mode;
they computed a 62 × 3 Mm3 box (1.88 × 1026 cm3), or
7.5 × 10−8 of the solar volume. Clearly a star–in–box
simulation, which is necessary to represent core collapse,
would require additional zones to maintain resolution.
This extreme requirement is softened, but not removed,
by the fact that the solar opacity is more temperature
dependent that the neutrino opacities (giving stronger
gradients), and the solar density gradient is steeper (re-
quiring more convective cells) for the solar case.
A comparison of zoning in the ASH code is more com-
plex. Miesch, et al. (2008) quote a value is 257 × 1024 ×
2048 for a star–in–box simulation, and state that “previ-
ous simulations did not have suﬃcient resolution to cap-
ture such dynamics”, which is consistent with the general
trend discussed above.

With their lower demand on computational resources,
2D simulations might seem tempting, but they are in-
adequate for turbulent simulations due to the diﬀerent
cascade direction relative to 3D. The ﬂows are simply

8 Previously the mechanical degrees of freedom were ignored

during the approach to equilibrium; see Clayton (1983).

9 See the tortuous development in Arnett (1967, 1977a,b, 1980,

1996) for example.

diﬀerent; see Fig. 4 in Meakin & Arnett (2007b). Sim-
ulations in 2D is more useful for debugging code (and
ideas) than describing stars.

The 3D simulations in Table 1 suggest that bulk fea-
tures of turbulence are reproduced even in the low–
resolution cases, but that more resolution is needed for
boundaries. Are the problem areas discussed by Janka,
et al. (2016) more akin to bulk features or to boundaries?
The gain–region is sensitive to diﬀerences in tangential
ﬂow (Couch & Ott 2013), a feature itself aﬀected by res-
olution. The standing accretion shock instability (SASI,
Blondin, Mezzacappa & DeMarino (2003)) seems more
global, and might be captured with even the coarse res-
olution now used. The lepton–number emission asymm-
metry (LESA, Tamborra, et al. (2014)) may be similar to
convection currents seen in O-burning and proton inges-
tion simulations at higher resolution (see §3). Compari-
son of Fig. 4 in Janka, et al. (2016) to Fig. 2 in Herwig,
et al. (2014) and Fig. 1 in Miesch, et al. (2008), all star–
in–box simulations, suggests that higher resolution may
be needed for the collapse simulations.

The 3D simulations of pre–collapse stages also have
implications for the collapse process. They suggest that
the boundaries may become steeper during the neutrino–
cooled stages, as collapse is approached. This would af-
fect core size and density stratiﬁcation in the progenitor.
It may decrease the rate of accretion on the newly-formed
neutron star; this would reduce the photodisentegration
losses which kill the original bounce shock and oppose
shock rebirth. A reduced accretion rate might also re-
sult from pre–collapse eruption or extensive mass loss.

It should be stressed that the integral scale turbulence
carries the most momentum and kinetic energy, does the
most transport, and is the least isotropic. Consequently
the isotropy of collapse, or lack thereof, is an important
feature.

4.4. Implications for thermonuclear supernovae

Carbon–burning under conditions of high electron de-
generacy begins with a stage of convective instability
(“simmering”) which temporarily delays the thermonu-
clear runaway (Arnett 1968, 1969b). This insures that
the runaway begins in a fully 3D and chaotic manner.
The time dependent convection algorithm originally used
was similar to that subsequently derived from 3D simu-
lations (Arnett, et al. 2015). Under–resolved simulations
would tend toward laminar ﬂow (a dipole velocity ﬁeld),
but ﬁner zoning results in chaotic, turbulent ﬂow.

The ﬁrst simulations of the delayed detonation model
of thermonuclear supernovae, with detailed nucleosyn-
thesis and relatively high 3D resolution, were done by
Seitenzahl, et al. (2013), using a 5123 grid and the
LEAFS code. They did not model the ignition phase.
They treated the “unresolved sub-grid acceleration of
ﬂame due to turbulence” with a sub-grid model, and did
nucleosynthesis by tracer particles. Fink, et al. (2014)
did pure deﬂagration models with the same code and
grid.

The simmering phase was investigated by Nonaka, et
al. (2012) and Zingale, et al. (2011) using the low-Mach
code MAESTRO, with grids of 3843 and 5763; MAE-
STRO allowed time steps which were up to a factor of

5

18 larger10 than a compressible code. After the burning
developed, this simulation was then continued with the
compressible hydrodynamics code CASTRO, (Malone, et
al. 2014); using AMR the eﬀective resolution was quoted
as 11523.

Extension of simulations to investigation of the bound-
ary between core collapse and thermonuclear explosion
of ONe cores (Jones et al. 2016), and to the white dwarf
merger channel for SNIa and merger in general and com-
mon envelope evolution (Ohlmann, et al. 2016) is begin-
ning to be made. The resolution issue seems particularly
acute for mergers because of the steep gradient at the
surface of each star (a boundary problem).

4.5. Young SN remnants

There is a deep connection between convection and the
Rayleigh-Tayor instability (RTI). The analysis of the RTI
leads to diﬀerential equations (Abarzhi 2010; Swisher,
et al. 2015) which are similar to those resulting from
analysis of the 3D simulations of turbulence (Arnett, et
al. 2015). Roughly speaking, convection starts from a
plume which breaks up into the turbulent cascade, and
being contained in a given volume, repeats the process
(Fig. 1). The RTI begins in a similar way, but is uncon-
tained, so that expansion converts internal energy into
kinetic energy by P dV work. In this sense, the RTI is
a process of convective freeze-out. The RTI converts the
initial compositional structure of a supernova progenitor
into a supernova remnant, so that the composition, dis-
tribution, and velocity of the ﬁlaments contain informa-
tion about both the progenitor and the explosion. This
is why young supernova remnants can be poorly mixed
(Hughes, et al. 2000).

This became clear with Cas A (Kirshner & Chevalier
1977; Chevalier & Kirshner 1978), which showed the pre-
viously predicted compositional signature of incomplete
oxygen burning—overabundances of Si, S, Ca as well as
O; Truran & Arnett (1970)—and the velocity signature
of plumes from incomplete overturn. This picture was ex-
tended with x-ray data (Becker, et al. 1979), and Chan-
dra observations (Hughes, et al. 2000), which showed
plumes, and an overabundance of Fe—which was pre-
dicted to be formed as radioactive 56Ni from explosive
Si-burning (Truran, Arnett & Cameron 1967; Woosley,
Arnett, & Clayton 1973). Analysis by Dopita (1987) in-
dicated overabundaces of Ar—explosive O burning, and
Ne—predicted from explosive C burning; Arnett (1969);
Woosley & Weaver (1978). The radiactive nucleus 44Ti
is a key link in the chain of reactions leading to the iron
peak in an explosion (Truran, Arnett & Cameron 1967),
and was predicted to have an abundance that might be
detected, as observations by NuStar (Harrison, et al.
2013; Boggs, et al. 2015) have now conﬁrmed. Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations (Fesen & Milisavlje-
vic 2016) have reﬁned and extended our understanding of
the velocity-composition structure. Reliably connecting
3D simulations of the explosion to this observed struc-
ture is an ongoing challenge (Young, et al. 2008), and one
which requires self–consistent 3D models of both the pro-
genitor (see §4.1, §4.2) and the collapse–explosion process
(§4.3, §4.4).
10 While useful for this problem, this speed–up is unfortunately

far too small to be of value for most stellar evolutionary stages.

4.6. Mixing boundaries and core helium burning

The CoRot and Kepler satellites have produced astero-
seismological data which strain the present generation of
stellar models. See Aerts, et al. (2010) for an overview,
and Schindler, et al. (2015) and Constantino, et al. (2015,
2016) for some examples. This is particularly acute for
the stage of core helium burning. Asteroseismology in-
dicates that the real stellar cores during He-burning are
signiﬁcantly larger than those predicted, and that adjust-
ment of parameters which were satisfactorily set during
hydrogen burning, is no longer adequate. Large adjust-
ments of these parameters (“overshoot”) within the ac-
cepted algorithmic framework produces implausible re-
sults, but still does not resolve the discrepancy with as-
teroseismology. It apprears that a better understanding
of the boundary physics during He burning is required.
The 3D simulations indicate that the Schwarzschild cri-
terion as normally used will underestimate the size of the
mixing region, and this error may be exacerbated by the
opacity behavior of the He–burning ashes. H-burning
produces He, which reduces the opacity; He–burning pro-
duces C and O, which increase the opacity. An increased
opacity tends to increase convective mixing and core size,
so that there may be positive feedback on mixing during
core He burning.

5. CONCLUSION

5.1. Weather and climate

While 3D simulations of the evolution of supernova
progenitors is becoming feasible, this is not true for ear-
lier stages. Core convection during main sequence hy-
drogen burning involves many (≥ 109) turnover times to
complete the exhaustion of fuel. The long–term evolu-
tion of a non-linear quasi–steady–state system is a dif-
ﬁcult problem; it involves the challenge of extrapolating
the weather to determine the climate. The steady-state
approximation (Arnett & Meakin 2011) discussed in §3
is plausible but of unproven validity for stars.

5.2. Eﬀective Reynolds number

Finite grid resolution requires a loss of information be-
low the grid scale, so that numerical simulations have
an eﬀective Reynolds number which is determined by
this “numerical viscosity”. The real Reynolds number
in stars (Re ∼ 109 or more) is much larger than the
eﬀective Reynolds number in the best–resolved simula-
tions (Re ∼ 103), so that we are forced to assume that
it is valid to extrapolate the computed behavior to the
stellar case (Arnett, Meakin & Viallet 2014). However,
terrestrial experiments at the largest Reynolds numbers
may not support this extrapolation (Dimotakis 2001).
At present we must extrapolate, but should also treat
the results with due caution.
The Reynolds number is Re∼ u(cid:96)/ν, where u is a char-
acteristic ﬂow velocity, (cid:96) is a characteristic length, and ν
is the kinematic viscosity. If we deﬁne a numerical vis-
cosity by νnum ∼ u∆r, where the new length ∆r is a
typical zone size, we may deﬁne the corresponding eﬀec-
tive Reynolds number as Reef f ∼ (cid:96)/∆r, or the inverse of
the linear resolution. Laboratory ﬂuids exhibit a transi-
tion from laminar to turbulent ﬂow at a critical value of
Re; it varies with problem, but is ∼ 100 or so. The nu-
merical resolution study mimics this behavior (Table 1),

with increasing resolution allowing more of the turbulent
cascade to be manifest (Viallet, et al. 2015). Simulations
of low resolution may be badly misleading because of
their high numerical viscosity, which tends toward lami-
nar ﬂow, suppressing turbulence.

5.3. Carbon, neon and silicon burning

Stellar evolutionary models of H–burning and He–
burning may be tested by conventional astronomical
observations;
for example, by their positions in the
Herzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram, by observations of
eclipsing binaries, and by asteroseismology (g-modes and
mixed modes; §4.6). However the stages of C, Ne, O, and
Si burning are short–lived because of neutrino–cooling,
and must be tested in other ways. Because of the dif-
ferent P`eclet numbers, calibrations from earlier photon–
cooled stages will be invalid. Fortunately direct numeri-
cal simulations of these stages are feasible. We have re-
sults from O burning (Meakin & Arnett 2007b; Viallet,
et al. 2013; Arnett, et al. 2015), but are just beginning
to simulate C burning (Cristini, et al. 2015), Neon burn-
ing, and Si burning (Couch, et al. 2015). Because each
stage is diﬀerent, each needs to be studied with realistic
turbulent ﬂow. Preliminary indications are that C, Ne
and O burning have a family resemblence, but Si burn-
ing and the ensuing neutronization by electron capture
are clearly somewhat diﬀerent; see §4.3 and Couch, et al.
(2015).

5.4. Entropy structure of atmospheres

eﬀ and g = − 1

In a recent summary of the character of 3D simulations
of stellar atmospheres, Magic (2016) has shown that they
may be characterized by two parameters, the entropy at
depth, and the gradient of entropy just below the sur-
face. This important result may be connected to the
conventional parameterization of stellar atmospheres by
gravity g and eﬀective temperature Teﬀ . We note that
L/4πr2 = F = σT 4
ρ dP/dr. The ﬂux at
the photosphere is a measure of the radiation entropy,
F = [ cgβ
4RY κ ]Srad, where the term in square brackets is
slowly varying (Arnett 1996). The gravititational accel-
eration g is a measure of the gradient of radiation entropy
through the pressure gradient in hydrostatic equilibrium.
While not yet exact, these approximations do catch the
trend of the simulations (Magic 2016), and may oﬀer
a signiﬁcant improvement over ﬁts to the ﬂawed MLT,
which lacks turbulent kinetic energy ﬂux and realistic
boundary physics.

5.5. Summary

Numerical simulations in 3D, now appearing for many
diﬀerent astrophysical problems, have become suﬃ-
ciently mature to show new aspects of turbulent ﬂow in
stable and explosive stages of stellar evolution, as well as
some errors in the conventional 1D theory. The issues of
resolution, and behavior over long time scales, are basic
challenges for a number of the problems discussed. With
increasing computational power and better algorithms,
the simulations are becoming truly turbulent, a signiﬁ-
cant step closer to reality. Some theoretical analysis of
the simulations has been successful, leading to insight
beyond the numbers.
