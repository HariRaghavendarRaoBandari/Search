ABSTRACT

We present the ﬁrst ab initio cosmological simulations of a CR7-like object which approximately reproduce
the observed line widths and strengths. In our model, CR7 is powered by a massive (2.23× 107 M(cid:12)), accreting
(0.25 Eddington; L• = 7.7× 1044 erg s−1) supermassive black hole (BH). Our model takes into account multi-
dimensional effects, X-ray feedback, secondary ionizations and primordial chemistry. We estimate Ly-α line
widths by post-processing simulation output with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and calculate emissivity con-
tributions from radiative recombination and collisional excitation. We ﬁnd the luminosities in the Lyman-α and
He II 1640 angstrom lines to be 5.0× 1044 and 2.4× 1043 erg s−1, respectively, in agreement with the observed
values of > 8.3× 1043 and 2.0× 1043 erg s−1. We also ﬁnd that the black hole heats the halo and renders it
unable to produce stars as required to keep the halo metal free. These results demonstrate the viability of the
BH hypothesis for CR7 in a cosmological context. Assuming the BH mass and accretion rate that we ﬁnd, we
estimate the synchrotron luminosity of CR7 to be P (cid:39) 1040 − 1041 erg s−1, which is sufﬁciently luminous to be
observed in µJy observations and would discriminate this scenario from one where the luminosity is driven by
Population III stars.

1. INTRODUCTION

One of the most intriguing observations of the high-redshift
Universe is the detection of the extraordinarily bright Lyman-
α emitting object in CR7, which exhibits some of the principal
characteristics predicted for a galaxy composed solely of pris-
tine primordial gas (Sobral et al. 2015). Among these char-
acteristics are bright He II 1640 angstrom emission, which is
indicative of a hot nebula powered by radiation with a par-
ticularly hard spectrum (e.g. Bromm et al. 2001; Tumlinson
et al. 2001; Oh et al. 2001; Schaerer 2002); the absence of
emission features from elements heavier than the helium pro-
duced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis; and a nearby ((cid:38) 5
kpc) metal-enriched galaxy, ultraviolet (UV) radiation from
which could have suppressed star formation, and the resul-
tant metal enrichment from supernovae, in its progenitor dark
matter (DM) halos.
These characteristics are consistent with two possibilities
for the sources of the radiation powering CR7: a massive ((cid:38)
107 M(cid:12)) cluster of Population III stars formed from the rapid
collapse of primordial gas photo-heated by the neighboring
galaxy (Johnson et al. 2010; Visbal et al. 2016), and an ac-
creting black hole (BH) with a mass (cid:38) 106 M(cid:12) (Pallottini et
al. 2015) which may drive a strong outﬂow that imprints fea-
tures in the Lyman-α line proﬁle (Smith et al. 2016; Dijkstra
et al. 2016). Concerning the latter possibility, it appears likely
that the neighboring galaxy may have produced sufﬁcient UV
radiation for the BH to have been born with a mass ∼ 105
M(cid:12) via direct collapse (Agarwal et al. 2015; Hartwig et al.
2015); if so, this would conﬁrm the validity of this mode of
BH seeding which has been previously invoked to explain the
most massive BHs at z (cid:38) 6 (for reviews see Volonteri 2012;
Haiman 2013; Johnson & Haardt 2016).

In this Letter, we present the ﬁrst cosmological hydrody-
namic simulations aimed directly at modeling the Lyman-α
emitting object in CR7, under the assumption that it is indeed

* jsmidt@lanl.gov

powered by accretion of primordial gas onto a BH which is
seeded at higher redshift (z ∼ 15). In the next Section, we
describe our Enzo radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the
growth and radiative feedback from the BH. In Section 3, we
present our modeling of the nebular emission powered by the
accretion process at the observed redshift z ∼ 6.6 of CR7. Fi-
nally, we conclude with a brief discussion of our results in
Section 4.

2. PROBLEM SETUP

The simulations were preformed using Enzo, a publicly
available AMR code for modeling astrophysical ﬂuid ﬂows
(Bryan et al. 2013), that contains the necessary modules
for hydrodynamics, radiation, primordial chemistry and black
hole physics required in this calculation. The initial condi-
tions were generated by MUSIC (Hahn and Abel (2011)),
also an open source cosmology code, using the Planck 2015
TT,TE,EE+lowP+lensing+ext best ﬁt parameters (Planck col-
laboration). MUSIC was run using the Eisenstein & Hu trans-
fer function with second-order perturbation theory enabled
and an initial redshift of z = 200.

To ﬁnd the optimal halo, several 4 Mpc/h boxes with 2563
resolution were generated with MUSIC. These boxes were
then run in Enzo with both baryons and dark matter down
to z = 6.6 with one level of AMR reﬁnement everywhere in
the box. YT’s (Turk et al. 2011) HOP halo ﬁnder was used on
several redshift snapshots for each box to ﬁnd a halo with the
right ﬁnal mass and stability properties: since a future nested-
reﬁnement simulation was to be run, it is important that the
halo remain stationary on the grid down to the ﬁnal redshift
with no large mergers from other halos that would be formed
off the nested grid. One box containing a 3× 1010 M(cid:12) halo,
roughly consistent with estimates for the halo mass from the
literature (Agarwal et al. 2015; Hartwig et al. 2015), with
these stability properties was chosen to be the simulation de-
scribed in the rest of this paper.

With this vetted cosmological box in hand, MUSIC was re-

2

run with nested grids to create a central ﬁne-grid region, ex-
tending 25% across the box centered on the known halo, with
an effective resolution of 10243 and the same random seeds as
before to reproduce the aforementioned halo with better reso-
lution. This central ﬁne-grid region contains 9.11× 1010 h−1
M(cid:12) of matter with a dark matter particle mass resolution of
4305.74 h−1 M(cid:12) and a baryon mass resolution of 803.9 h−1
M(cid:12). These initial conditions became the basis for our pro-
duction run.

These initial condition were evolved in Enzo with 9-species
primordial chemistry and cooling (H, H+, He, He+, He++, e-,
H2, H2+ and H-) allowing up to nine levels of AMR reﬁne-
ment in the ﬁne-grid region triggered by overdensities in dark
matter or baryons and the additional criteria of 32 cells across
a Jean’s length. Nine levels of reﬁnement represents a spa-
cial resolution of ∼ 30 pc/h. The simulation was run until our
candidate halo reached 108 M(cid:12) around z ∼ 15. At this point
a massive black hole seed was inserted in the center of the
halo and radiation feedback using an X-ray spectrum taken
from Johnson et. al (2011; see also e.g. Kuhlen & Madau
2005) was emitted from the seed as feedback. This spectrum
was binned into four equal bins representing the ﬁrst through
fourth 25% bins of energy of that spectrum. The accretion
onto the black hole was regulated by the subgrid alpha disk
formalism of DeBuhr et al.(2010) and a Lyman Werner back-
ground of J21 = 104 (in units of 10−21 erg s−1 cm−2 Hz−1 sr−1)
was turned on, in order to mimic the radiative feedback from
the galaxies nearby CR7 (e.g. Agarwal et al. 2015).

A few different initial black hole seeds were attempted. The
reason being is that large black hole seeds, the 104−5 M(cid:12)
suggested in the direct collapse model, reach 107 M(cid:12) rather
quickly and then loiter in that region with signiﬁcantly sub-
Eddington accretion. On the other hand, 103 black hole seeds
take much longer to grow to 107 M(cid:12) and thus are closer to the
near-Eddington accretion proposed in the literature. We ﬁnd
that candidates that are still within a factor of a few from Ed-
dington at z = 6.6 have line ratios that match the observations
best with our best seed presented in this paper being 3160 M(cid:12).
It must be stressed however that this seed is dependent on the
dynamics of the halo chosen. For example, had we simulated
a halo that arrived at 108 M(cid:12) later on through mergers, a larger
black hole seed more like 104−5 M(cid:12) may have been needed.

Figure 1 shows proﬁles of the halo at z = 6.6.

3. POST-PROCESS

In primordial galaxies, Lyman-α primarily originates from
a sequence of de-excitations in atomic hydrogen following
recombination. If the ionizing spectrum is harder than that
produced by massive Pop III stars, soft x-rays (∼ 1 Kev) can
escape largely ionized regions and be absorbed in the neu-
tral IGM. Ionizations by high energy photons result in cor-
respondingly energetic free electrons which can serve to also
ionize and excite additional neutral hydrogen. Up to 30% of
an electron’s energy in such scenarios can result in Lyman-
α luminosity (Baek & Ferrara 2013, Valdes & Ferrara 2008).
We note that this scenario will not take place with a softer ion-
izing spectrum as ionizing photons are liable to be absorbed
in a larger HII region and electron enegies only contribute to
heat the gas through electron-electron scatterings.

ENZO+MORAY treats secondary ionizations (Wise & Abel
2010). The Lyman-α emissivity in the frame of the ﬂuid (ν)
of a parcel of gas of volume V with electron and proton num-

where C is the fraction of recombinations resulting in the
Lyman-α transition, αB is the case-B recombination coefﬁ-
cient, ELy-α is the energy of the 2 → 1 transition, and φ(ν)
is the Voygt line proﬁle which takes into account the effects
of thermal doppler broadening and is normalized to 1. The
escape fraction fesc of Lyman-α photons for a BH scenario
is ∼ 0.5 and ∼ 0.1 for primordial stellar populations respec-
tively (see Hartwig et al. 2015). Our process also takes into
account contributions from collisional excitation and the ef-
fects of collisional de-excitation.

Lyman-α is a resonate line, so line strengths and widths
must be calculated with a method which takes into account
scattering. Our Monte Carlo (MC) Lyman-α transfer calcu-
lation, facilitated by the HOT framework (Warren & Salmon
1995) is identical to that found in Djistra (2014) but we do not
take into account absorptions at scatterings and energy losses
from recoil (e.g. Barnes 2014) or relativistic effects which
are negligable at these energies. Our MC post-process is only
useful to estimate the spread of emission. We further assume
steady-state transfer, i.e. we post-process only a single data
dump at z = 6.6.

HeII 1640 Å emission may also be recombinatory, but at
temperatures 105 − 106 K, emission from collisional excita-
tions dominate. To derive HeII 1640 Å emission, we use the
method in Yang et al.
(2005). Such emission is not reso-
nant, so will only be thermally and kinematically broadened
by bulk ﬂuid motions.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

CR7 is the brightest Ly-α emitter known at z > 6. At a
redshift of z = 6.6 it is estimated to have a Ly-α luminosity
LLyα (cid:38) 8.0× 1043 erg s−1 with a narrow line width of ∼ 266±
15 km s−1. The HeII 1640 Å line is luminous LHeII (cid:39) 2.0×1043
erg s−1 with a width of 130± 30 km s−1. This implies a large
LHeII/LLyα ratio (cid:39) 0.22 (Sobral et al. 2015) which is strongly
suggestive of a hard ionizing spectrum (Pallottini et al. 2015).
By z = 6.6, our halo has acquired 3×1010 M(cid:12) and the 3162
M• initial seed has grown to 3.23× 107 M(cid:12). In our cosmo-

logical model, CR7 is situated on a major ﬁlament and is fed
strongly aspherically (see Figure 2). Recombinatory Lyman-
α emissivity originates from the inner ∼ 3 kpc while HeII
1640 Å emission appears in the direct vicinity of the BH. In
Figure 1, we plot azimuthally averaged number densities of

primordial species as a function of radius and overlay gas tem-
perature in blue. Throughout the halo, temperatures and gas
pressures are prohibitive for star formation.

We summarize our results in Table 1. At at z = 6.6, the
instantaneous Lyman-α luminosities in our model due to re-
combination and collisional excitation are 7.6 × 1043 and
4.2 × 1044 erg s−1, respectively. The total Lyman-α and He
II 1640 angstrom luminosities are 2.4× 1043 and 5.0 ×1044
erg s−1, respectively. This Lyman-α luminosity is a relatively
high fraction of the total luminosity emitted from the BH. We
note that our emission model assumes steady state accretion,
which may account for this if the Lyman-α emission is partly
due to gas excited by X-rays emitted from the BH during an
episode of faster accretion just before z = 6.6. The FWHM of
the HeII 1640 Å line is 210 km s−1 which is broader than ob-
servations (130± 30 km s−1) while Lyman-α exhibits a width
of 270 km s−1 after MC post-process in good agreement with
observed values of ∼ 266± 15 km s−1 (see Figure 3). This is

The HeII 1640 Å and Lyman-α lines in CR7 are offset in
velocity space by ∆v = +160 km s−1 (Sobral et al. 2015). 1D
calculations by Smith et al. (2016) are able to reproduce this
offset by demonstrating that a luminous central source with a
hard spectrum drives an outﬂow which would separate HeII
and Ly-α emission in velocity space. An expanding shell of
material is not evident in our model and so we are not able
to reproduce this offset in our Monte Carlo post-processing.
There are several possible explanations for this. Our CR7
model is ellipsoidal, not spherical, being compressed along
the direction of the angular momentum vector. This strong
ﬂattening of the system allows for radiation to escape CR7
through higher angles of latitude. Additionally, we do not
model Lyman-α feedback as do Smith et al. (2016), which is
a signiﬁcant contribution to radiation pressure in the system.
We note that Population III stars are expected to produce
nebular Lyman-α emission principally from recombination,
and not from collisional excitation as is the case for the harder
X-ray spectrum emitted from an active black hole. We esti-
mate an upper limit for the Lyman-α luminosity of 1.14 ×1044
that could be generated by recombination emission powered
by Population III stars, by assuming the gas within the halo
is fully ionized. This is only luminous enough to explain the
CR7 luminosity if the Lyman-α escape fraction is fesc (cid:38) 0.8,
much higher than previously estimated (e.g. Hartwig et al.
2015). This, along with the extremely high star formation ef-
ﬁciency of (cid:38) 0.1 that is required for Population III stars to
explain the observed emission (Visbal et al. 2016; Smith et
al. 2016), poses a strong challenge to this alternative model
for CR7.

While Ly-α is extended on the kpc scale, much of the he-
lium emission in our model originates from the vicinity of
the BH. We ﬁnd that to maintain line widths ∼ 100 km/s in
agreement with CR7 requires that the line be only broadened
by virial velocities of bulk ﬂuid motion and thermal broaden-
ing. Our models with more massive BHs both diminish and
broaden HeII 1640 Å emission, in some cases giving rise to
a double-peaked proﬁle which characterizes line observations
of expanding shells of gas. The complex line proﬁles are not
observed in CR7 which suggests an upper limit on BH lumi-
nosity in models of CR7 powered by an accreting BH.

Could CR7 be detected in the radio? Our estimate of the
accretion rate (0.25 Eddington) suggests the BH is accreting
within the “thin disk” regime or “quasar mode” (e.g. Dubois
et al. 2011) where the prospects of launching a relativis-
tic jet and powering radio lobes remains unclear. Yet radio
synchrotron emission could originate on scales of 100s of
Schwarzschild radii from relativistic accretion shocks. For
our values of M• and ˙M• in the analytic model by Ishibashi
& Courvoisier (2014) and adopting the authors’ estimates for
electron spectral index p and ambient magnetic ﬁeld B, we es-
timate a synchrotron luminosity of ∼ 1.0×1039 erg s−1 arising
from subgrid scales. The total observed radio ﬂux density Sν
of CR7 integrated over the source is

where Pν0 is the power radiated at frequency ν0, DL is the
luminosity distance, ν is the frequency of observations related
to the emitted frequency ν0 by the doppler shift. We take α ≈
1.5, accounting for the z ∼ α correlation for steepening radio

processing through the simulation domain assuming steady state emission
(i.e., we only post-process a single data dump at z = 6.6) and employing a
spherical tally surface. The line proﬁle exhibits some skew and has a line
width FWHM of 270 km s−1 in agreement with observations. Our model
does not predict a 160 km s−1 velocity offset for Lyman-α with respect to the
HeII 1640 Å line (indicated by the dashed vertical line) as is observed (see
text).

spectral indices with increasing redshift (α (cid:39) 0.7 at z = 0; see
Cavagnolo et al. 2010; Condon 1992) for emitted frequencies
at 10.0 GHz. For sensitivites of a few µJy per beam in L-band
(ν (cid:39) 1.3 GHz), this imposes a detection limit of Pν0
(cid:38) 1041 erg
s−1. This quantity is mildly sensitive to the choice of α; for
(cid:38) 1040
local-universe values, the detection limit becomes Pν0
erg s−1.

Scaling relationships for accretion, jet power and radio lu-
minosity exist in the literature. If we insert our active galac-
tic nuceli (AGN) luminosity in X-rays and M• into a model
by Merloni et al. (2003) which is based on a thoery of scale-
invariant jets (Heinze & Sunyaev 2008), we obtain a log-mean
radio luminosity of P ≈ 1.4× 1040 erg s−1 though their model
suffers from very large scatter, spanning a few orders of mag-
nitude. If we apply our data to the models of Meier (2001),
adopting the thin disk regime for the Schwarzschild case (his
equation 4), we obtain a jet power of ∼ 1.0 × 1041 erg s−1.
If we utilize the relation between jet power and radio output
found in Cavagnolo et al. (2010), this corresponds to a radio
luminosity of only 1035 erg s−1. Our BH is accreting at an
appreciable fraction of Eddington, and such disks can be un-
stable and oscillate between low, hard (LHS) state where radio
brightness is expected to increase and high, soft (HSS) state.
At a reduced accretion rate of 0.1 Eddington, jet power for a

rotating black hole would be (cid:38) 1044 erg s−1 corresponding to
a radio luminosity of Pν0 (cid:39) 2.0× 1042 erg s−1 which would be
detectable in µJy observations. Such jets may drive outﬂows
and could be responsible for the 160 km s−1 offset of the Ly-α
line from the systemic velocity. Any luminous radio emission
from CR7 is likely to be evidence of AGN activity, as syn-
chrotron emission in star formation regions primarily arises
from supernova remnants which are thought to be absent in
CR7 from the lack of observed metals.

Our work provides important additional support for the
massive BH model of CR7 via detailed radiation hydrody-
namic cosmological simulations. Our study also provides ad-
ditional evidence in favor the BH model over the Pop III stel-
lar population scenario.
