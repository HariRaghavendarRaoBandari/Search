We develop a simple method to study the temperature dependence εkn(T ) for kn the con-
duction band minimum or valence maximum in polar semiconductors. We use the Allen-
Heine-Cardona theory in the adiabatic approximation, including an imaginary broadening
parameter iδ to supress noise in the density-functional integrations. Fr¨ohlich polaron
methods provide an analytic expression for the contribution of the problematic optical
phonon mode. We use this to correct the temperature dependence obtained from the
adiabatic approximation. Test calculations are done for zincblende GaN for an 18x18x18
integration grid. The Fr¨ohlich correction is of order 0.02 eV for the zero-point energy
shifts, and smaller for the thermal shifts.

Introduction

Computation by density functional theory (DFT) of the temperature dependence of elec-
tronic properties of semiconductors and insulators, and also metals, has grown recently
[1–8]. Fits to experimental data with diﬀerent models have also been done [9–12]. The
temperature dependence of the band gap of semiconductors aﬀects applications. For ar-
bitrary bands, the electron-phonon contribution to the renormalization (Ekn − εkn) of the
electronic bands, to second order in the ion’s displacement, is

Here, hkn|H (1)
|k + qn′i is the matrix element for scattering an electron k by a phonon
q; it has units of energy and a typical size of roughly the geometric mean of electron and
phonon energies. The Debye-Waller term hkn|H (2)
jj |kni is the second order interaction
energy involving two phonons qj and q′j ′, but only qj = −q′j ′ enters in lowest order.
The small parameter iδ ensures the theory is well deﬁned. We will not consider thermal
expansion in this work.

The perturbative formulas used by Allen, Heine and Cardona [13, 14] drop the phonon
energy ±ωqj from the denominators in comparison with the electron energy diﬀerence
εkn − εk+qn′. This is an adiabatic approximation. The justiﬁcation is that, in semiconduc-
tors, typical energy denominators are much larger than ωq. However, it was pointed out
by Ponc´e et al. [3] that for polar materials, it is necessary to keep the ±ωLO for longitu-
dinal optic (LO) modes to avoid a divergence at band extrema caused by the long-range
Fr¨ohlich-type electron-phonon interaction. To be speciﬁc, the problem is worst at k = 0.

The integral involves R d3q and a factor 1/q2 from the long-range polar electron-phonon
matrix element. If the ±ωLO is omitted, the integral R dq/q2 diverges at q = 0.

There are also singular denominators εkn −εk+qn′ ± ωqj on special surfaces in q-space.
These cases create problems if integrated numerically on a mesh. Regardless of how dense
the q-mesh is, singular denominators of this type do not converge (as already noted in [14]).
A principal-value treatment in three dimensions s required. A useful procedure is to keep
the iδ in the denominator ﬁnite and study the convergence in this parameter, as has been
extensively applied in [3]. Since the true result around this type of singularity integrates
to a small contribution when done correctly, it is generally a fairly safe expedient to add
an imaginary energy iδ, with a typical value of ≈ 0.1eV.

When the state of interest kn is a band extremum, the ±ωqj in the emission term
(with factor nqj + 1) removes the singularity, but the absorption term (with factor nqj)
has a singularity surface near q = 0. Depending on how ﬁne is the integration grid, the
adjacent mesh points may lie inside or outside the singularity surface. The contribution
from the central regions is not well computed. Suppressing the size of these contributions
by using a signiﬁcant δ should only be a problem when the long range polar singularity at
q = 0 causes the central contributions to be particularly large. A sensible approach is to
neglect all ±ωqj terms in the denominator, and use a broadening δ of size similar to the
typical small denominator. Adding iδ causes the integrand to vanish at the central mesh
point q = 0, since the denominator is pure imaginary. An analytic correction can then
be added in cases where the central region contribution is signiﬁcant. This should deal
adequately with all problems of singularities and convergence, provided the integration
mesh is suﬃciently dense (for example 20 × 20 × 20) for a non-polar material like diamond.
In [3] the authors write the singular part of the electron-phonon matrix element, pro-
portional to Z ∗/q (where Z ∗ is the Born eﬀective charge) in the q → 0 limit. The full
theory is contained in the perturbative expressions worked out by Vogl [15]. The singular
part corresponds to the Fr¨ohlich polaron [16]. A Vogl expression is studied in [17] from an
ab-initio perspective, and compared to the Fr¨ohlich model at ﬁnite q. In a similar work,
Sjakste et al. [18] compare the Vogl expression for small q with DFPT calculations, and

show that they coincide for q → 0. All agree that the polaron is the dominant contribution
in the small q region, and needs to be treated carefully.

The material we choose for the computations is zincblende GaN (cubic), abbreviated
c-GaN, rather than the more stable wurtzite GaN (hexagonal), or h-GaN. Our corrections
use the eﬀective mass approximation (εk = 2k2/2m∗), which works well since only a small
region near k = 0 is involved. Holes at the top of the triply-degenerate valence band might
need more careful integrations, but we approximate them by using an average band mass.
One reason for choosing Gallium nitride is its useful properties, including a high ther-
mal conductivity [19] and a high melting point that allows it to operate at high tempera-
tures. Its wide and direct band gap make it eﬃcient for lasers [20], and for high-power and
high-frequency electronic devices [21–24]. Its use in white LEDs makes it a fundamental
material to reduce worldwide consumption of electricity. Alloys with InN and AlN can
engineer their optical and electrical properties [25].

Although h-GaN has been more thoroughly studied, c-GaN has several advantages: it
has better n and p doping properties [26,27], higher saturated electron drift mobilities [25],
and it is convenient to work in the 510 nm region. This justiﬁes studying properties of
c-GaN, where polar eﬀects are simpler.

We ﬁrst study how the correction changes with the integration radius. Then we calcu-
late the temperature dependence of the minimum of the conduction band, including the
polaron correction. And ﬁnally, we study the valence band. We use ABINIT [28, 29] to
carry out the ab-initio calculations.

2 Discussion and results

We use Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials for both Gallium and Nitrogen in the Perdew-
Wang [30] parametrization of local density approximation (LDA), generated using the
fhi98PP code [31]. The Ga-3d electrons are included as valence electrons. We also use
a 6x6x6 Monkhorst-Pack (MP) [32] centered k-point grid in our calculations and a high
energy cutoﬀ of 1700 eV in order to converge the total energy to less than 0.018 meV
per atom (h-GaN converges well with 1400 eV). We get a lattice constant of 4.499 ˚A;
experimental values are 4.507 ˚A [33] and 4.52 ˚A [34]. The phonons and electron-pohonon
interaction matrix elements, using DFPT, are carried out in a 18x18x18 MP q-point grid.
We use a ﬁxed imaginary part in the denominator of i0.1eV.

Except in metals at low T , the Fermi function fk+q,n′ in (1) can be neglected, and
only Bose factors nqj contribute T -dependence. The “adiabatic approximation” consists
of ignoring the ±ωqj in denominators, which is only dangerous in metals at low T where
Fermi factors have sharp edges, or in polar materials where the matrix element is enhanced
by long-range electric polarization accompanying the phonon.

A polaron describes the coupled system of an electron and phonons. Most often, only
zero temperature is considered, but the concept works also at T > 0. The most famous
case is the Fr¨ohlich, or “large” polaron, present in ionic crystals and polar semiconductors.
Fr¨ohlich theory is designed for the bottom of the conduction band or top of the valence

band where an eﬀective mass approximation εk = 2k2/2m∗ is accurate, and for intraband
(n = n′) coupling only to the polar LO mode, where ωLO has negligible q-dependence.
The matrix element |M|2 is 4πα(ωLO)2(aLO/Ω0q2).
It is the factor q−2 which comes

from long range polarization. The distance aLO = p/2m∗ωLO is of order 10 ˚A, larger
than the zero-point root mean square vibrational displacement uLO = p/2µωLO by
the large factor pµ/m∗, where µ is the appropriate ionic reduced mass. Since we are

interested in the renormalization of the band gap, we focus on the band extrema at k = Γ.
At T = 0, extending the sum over the Brillouin Zone to inﬁnity, the famous result is
Ek=0,c − εk=0,c = −αωLO. The Fr¨ohlich coupling constant is α = Vc/ωLO, where Vc is
a Coulomb interaction strength Vc = (e2/8π˜ǫ0¯ǫaLO). The ˜ǫ0 is the permittivity of free
space, and the ¯ǫ is deﬁned in terms of the low and high frequency dielectric constants as
1/¯ǫ = 1/ǫ∞ − 1/ǫ0. For a non-degenerate band (e.g. the conduction band), the Fr¨ohlich
contribution to the renormalization at temperature T is given by

eﬀective mass approximation, ωLO is the longitudinal optical frequency, and nB(T ) =
1/[exp(ωLO/kT ) − 1] is the Bose Einstein distribution. The radius of integration is qF .
It is perhaps not clear if it should be taken as the radius qD of the Debye sphere whose
volume is the BZ volume, or if should be approximated by the region in which the eﬀective
mass treatment is valid. The ﬁrst term corresponds to phonon emission and is included in
Fr¨ohlich’s treatment at T = 0. The second term is only present at non-zero temperature
and it corresponds to phonon absorption.

In the adiabatic approximation, the term between brackets ([ ]) in (2) is replaced by
(2nB + 1)/(q2 − i2m∗δ/2), and then the real part is taken. Subtracting this term from the
ab-initio calculation and adding the correct Fr¨ohlich contribution, with ωLO instead of the
imaginary term, we obtain a meaningful result. We wish to be able to restrict the analytic
integration in (2) to a small radius qc close to q = 0 for two reasons: (i) The eﬀective
mass approximation, and thus the Fr¨ohlich model, is only valid close to q = 0; (ii) We are
assuming the adiabatic approximation is good away from q = 0. The calculation is based
on the fact that a small imaginary parameter only aﬀects slightly the result, just as for
the rest of the ﬁnite electron-phonon terms.

To determine the optimal integation radius, we calculate the diﬀerence between the
Fr¨ohlich-polaron contribution and the adiabatic approximation (replacing ωLO with i0.1
eV) for diﬀerent radii qF of integration. The conduction band is very isotropic, with an
eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.16me. The diﬀerences are shown in Fig. 1. We see that going
beyond a radius of integration of qF = 0.094 ˚A−1, the curves diﬀer by less than 1 meV for
all temperatures. This means that the adiabatic expression and the Fr¨ohlich polaron diﬀer

only close to q = 0. For q > 0.094 ˚A−1, the adiabatic expression is a good approximation
to the Fr¨ohlich polaron. We will refer to this radius as the convergence radius qc.

In the adiabatic approximation, the denominator (for k = 0 and q → 0) is iδ, i.e.,
pure imaginary. Because the energy renormalization is given by the real part, the central
mesh-cell contribution is 0 in the adiabatic approximation. But this is not the case in
a proper non-adiabatic calculation, so we need to add the Fr¨ohlich contribution in the
central grid cell. Let us denote by qm the radius of the central cell. The analysis can be
separated in two cases:

(i) qm < qc: This case is a little bit more involved and it is the one present in the
calculation, since we have qm = 0.067 ˚A−1 and qc = 0.094 ˚A−1. We will discuss it in the
Appendix.

(ii) qm > qc: This case provides a simple method that can be easily used in other mate-
rials. We will illustrate this method with our c-GaN calculation, although the more careful
analysis of the Appendix is required for a more precise result. Since the adiabatic DFT
calculation has no contribution from the central cell, it does not have to be subtracted.
Therefore, the correction is just given by (2) with qF = qm, which is a good enough radius
of integration since qm > qc.

The corrections we get at T = 0 K and T = 1000 K are −19 meV and −22 meV,
respectively. For the more precise method described in the Appendix, the corrections are
-17 meV at T = 0 K and -17.5 meV at T = 1000 K. They diﬀer by 2 − 5 meV. Roughly
speaking, the adiabatic DFT curve of EΓc − εΓc versus temperature is shifted downwards
rigidly. This can be understood from the slow temperature dependence of the Fr¨ohlich

from 0 to 1000 K. In Fig. 2 we plot the adiabatic calculation of EΓc − εΓc done with
ABINIT, the corrected result, and the Fr¨ohlich contribution at ﬁnite temperature (taking
as qF the radius of the BZ). In the limit qF → ∞, (2) reduces to −αωLO(nLO + 1).

For the valence band, the correction is more complicated because of two factors: bands
are degenerate and they are not isotropic. Since we are not considering spin-orbit coupling,
the top of the valence band is triply degenerate. For degenerate (and isotropic) bands,
Trebin and R¨ossler [35] have generalized Fr¨ohlich’s result (see equation (11) of their paper).
Deﬁnitions of the tensors they use can be found in Baldereschi and Lipari [36]. In the
case of c-GaN however, the bands are not isotropic. For the lightest band, the eﬀective
mass varies between 0.13me and 0.16me, in the [100] and [111] directions respectively. The
heavier bands coincide in the [100] and [111] directions, with eﬀective masses of 0.81me
and 1.78me. But in the [110] direction, their eﬀective masses are 0.81me and 4.5me. To
use the result of [35], ﬁrst we average the inverse of the eﬀective masses in the three
directions for each band and treat them as if they were isotropic. We get 0.14me, 0.99me
and 1.49me. And second, since in the model of [35] there is one light band and two heavy
ones, we average 0.99me and 1.49me, and get 1.19me.

For k = Γ, [EΓv − εΓv]Fr (where v indicates valence) is an average of the Fr¨ohlich
contribution of the light and heavy bands. When the radius of integration qF goes to
inﬁnity, the renormalization is +ωLO(α0 + 2α1)/3, where α0 is the Fr¨ohlich coupling

constant of the light hole and α1 of the heavy ones. If the three bands have the same
eﬀective mass, the result reduces to the Fr¨ohlich polaron.3 Using the simple method
described for case (ii), since the valence band is already treated approximately, we get
that the corrections at T = 0 and at T = 1000 K are 24 meV and 23 meV. The adiabatic
ab-initio calculation gives a band renormalization of 62 meV at T=0 K and 185 meV at
T=1000 K before the correction. The total renormalization is 86 meV and 208 meV at
T = 0 K and T = 1000 K, respectively. In Fig. 3 we have the results for the valence band
analogous to Fig 2.

Therefore, we see that the Fr¨ohlich correction provides approximately a constant shift
of the renormalization by -17 meV for all temperatures in the conduction band, and +24
meV for the valence band. The Fr¨ohlich correction is almost 40% for the ZPR of the
conduction band and close to 30% in the valence band. At 1000 K, the corrections are
between 10-15% of the result obtained from the DFT calculation.

3For the valence band, the sign of the q2 term in the denominator changes. Also, the factors nB + 1 − f
and nB + f , where f is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, are now nB and nB + 1 instead of nB + 1 and nB,
respectively. As a result, we get the same integrals as in the conduction band, with an extra minus sign;
the band renormalization is now positive.

3 Conclusions

Our procedure is to ﬁrst calculate the whole electronic renormalization in the adiabatic
approximation with an iδ. The iδ cures the divergence that precludes the use of the
adiabatic approximation at the extrema of polar materials. Then we add the Fr¨ohlich
polaron contribution in the central mesh-cell, omitted in the DFT adiabatic calculation
due to the pure imaginary denominator iδ. This method is then a combination of the
adiabatic and non-adiabatic approximations. We avoid using a very dense q-grid by
treating the Fr¨ohlich polaron analytically. By this method, we calculate the electron-
phonon temperature dependence of the minimum of the conduction band, and estimate
it for the valence band. The polaron contribution is a signiﬁcant fraction of the total
electron-phonon renormalization, although it decreases as the temperature increases.

5 Appendix

Here we describe the method for case (i), where qm < qc. The diﬀerence between the
Fr¨ohlich contribution and the adiabatic expression is small beyond a radius qc. Because of
the iδ there is no adiabatic contribution from the central cell (in c-GaN, a truncated octa-
hedron), which can be approximated by a sphere of radius qm. Instead of subtracting the
adiabatic contribution from 0 to qc, we have to subtract it from qm to qc. Therefore we need
to determine what is the adiabatic contribution in this region. The ab-initio calculation
consists of evaluating the renormalization expression at the sampling points, multiplying
by the surrounding volume ΩBZ/N (with ΩBZ the volume of the BZ) and summing. In our
case of a 18x18x18 grid, the sampling points P closest to Γ are π/a(±1, ±1, ±1)/9. Their
radii are qP = 0.134 ˚A−1, while qm = qP /2 = 0.067 ˚A−1 and qc = 0.094 ˚A−1. So only the
closest sampling cells intersect the sphere of radius qc. For the c-GaN conduction band,
εP − εΓ = 0.35 eV. The correction is then

Some additional comments are appropriate. The eﬀective mass varies between 0.157me
and 0.175me when taking diﬀerent radii up to 0.094 ˚A−1. The diﬀerence of the Fr¨ohlich
contribution for these two eﬀective masses in the correction is only 0.6 meV or less for all
temperatures. So the change of the eﬀective mass with k causes negligible errors in our
method.

For grids denser than Nq×Nq×Nq with Nq = 18, we are in case (i), with qm considerably
smaller than qc. In this case, instead of taking the energy diﬀerence between Γ and nearby
points P in the denominator as we just described, we use the eﬀective mass approximation
and integrate from qm 6 q 6 qc.

It is important to notice that at a minimum of the conduction bands, we can make the
iδ very small in the adiabatic approximation (unless some band is very heavy, as the c-GaN
heavier valence band). What changes, is that the adiabatic part of the correction (present
only in case (i)) gets bigger. However, if we want to use the method in its simpliﬁed form
for qm . qc, a value of δ ≈ ωLO is convenient.
