Latent heat and the Fourier law

Abstract

We present computer simulations run with a stochastic cellular automaton which de-
scribes d = 1 particle systems connected to reservoirs which keep two diﬀerent densities
at the endpoints. We ﬁx the parameters so that there is a phase transition (of the van
der Waals type) and observe that if the densities at the boundaries are metastable
then, after a transient, the system reaches an apparently stationary regime where the
current ﬂows from the reservoir with smaller density to the one with larger density.

Keywords: Cellular Automaton; Metastability; Fourier and Fick laws.

1 Introduction

The Fourier law states that the heat ﬂux is proportional to minus the gradient of the
temperature, analogously the Fick law says that the mass ﬂux is proportional to minus
the gradient of the mass density. Both laws state that a gradient gives rise to a current.
On the other hand in the presence of a ﬁrst order phase transition there is a spontaneous
separation of phases giving rise to a gradient (of the corresponding order parameter)
without a current. Purpose of this article is to investigate how this ﬁts with the Fourier
or the Fick law, in particular to understand the role of the latent heat in heat conduction.
In the sequel we will however refer to mass transport (hence to the Fick law), as we will
study particles models.

The physical system we have in mind is made by a channel containing a gas of particles
and by two density reservoirs which are respectively connected to the right and to the left
of the channel and which ﬁx the density of the gas at the endpoints of the channel at values
ρ+ and, respectively, ρ−. We further suppose that the temperature is ﬁxed throughout
the channel at a value for which there is a phase transition.

We model the channel as one-dimensional and the gas as a system of particles which
interact via a two-body attractive Kac potential, which in the Kac scaling limit gives
rise to a van der Waals phase transition. We actually consider two models, the ﬁrst

one (described in Section 3) is a lattice gas with Kawasaki dynamics and Kac potential,
the second one (described in Section 2) is a stochastic cellular automaton (CA) whose
updating rules mimic the Kawasaki dynamics of the ﬁrst one. While the ﬁrst model is
convenient for a theoretical analysis, the second one is amenable to computer simulations.
Unfortunately, we cannot go very far theoretically and our results rely essentially on the
simulations.

The simulations exhibit two totally unexpected phenomena when the reservoirs densities
ρ− and ρ+ are such that ρ− < ρ+, and for the gas in the channel these values are mi-
nus/plus metastable (i.e. metastable and in the two diﬀerent phases). In such a case the
system seems to reach a stationary state such that (1) the current in the channel becomes
positive so that mass goes from the reservoir at lower density to the one with larger den-
sity; (2) in a large fraction of the volume the density is metastable. We will argue in
Section 3 that this does not contradict the Fick law, but our arguments are not math-
ematically complete. A consequence of (1) is the theoretical possibility of constructing
circuits made of the above channel connected to two large but ﬁnite reservoirs which also
exchange mass with each other (either directly or via a second channel where the gas has
no phase transitions). Preliminary simulations seem to indicate that, in the circuit, after
a transient, there is a stationary current which runs in the absence of an external bias.
We believe that such a state is metastable with a very long life, but that in the long run
the system will eventually decay to a state with no current.

2 The simulations

Our simulations use a CA introduced in [1] to simulate the time evolution of a system of
particles which undergoes a phase transition of van der Waals type. The CA describes
a system of particles in the interval [1, L] of Z, hereafter called “channel”. The particles
have only velocities v ∈ {−1, 1} and we impose single occupancy, namely there cannot
be two particles at same site with same velocity, η(x, v) ∈ {0, 1} being the occupation
variable at (x, v).
The deﬁnition of the CA involves ﬁve parameters, L, γ : γ−1 ∈ N, C > 0 and 0 ≤ ρ− <
ρ+ ≤ 1. We use the following notation: for x ∈ [1, L], η(x) := η(x,−1) + η(x, 1); for x ≥ 1,
η(+)(x) = η(x) if x ∈ [1, L] and η(+)(x) = 2ρ+ if x > L; for x ≤ L, η(−)(x) = η(x) if
x ∈ [1, L] and η(−)(x) = 2ρ− if x < 1; ﬁnally for x ∈ [1, L] we call

x+γ−1(cid:88)

y=x+1

x−1(cid:88)

y=x−γ−1

N+,x,γ =

η(+)(y), N−,x,γ =

η(−)(y)

We are now ready to deﬁne how the CA operates. The unit time step updating is obtained
as the result of two successive operations: (1) velocity ﬂip. At all sites x ∈ [1, L] where there
is only one particle we update the velocity of the particle to become +1 with probability
2 + x,γ and −1 with probability 1
2 − x,γ, x,γ = Cγ2[N+,x,γ − N−,x,γ]. At all other sites
1

the occupation numbers are left unchanged. Moreover, after adding two auxiliary sites 0
and L + 1, we put a particle in 0 with velocity +1 with probability ρ−, while we leave
it empty with complementary probability; analogously we put a particle in L + 1 with
velocity −1 with probability ρ+ while we leave it empty with complementary probability.
(2) advection. Each particle moves by one lattice step in the direction of its velocity, if it

2

goes to L + 1 or to 0 it is deleted.

Remarks. x,γ is a “small bias” (for γ small) which directs the velocity towards regions
with higher density. As discussed in the next section, this can be interpreted as the action
of two-body “long range” attractive forces; in such a context the constant C is proportional
to the inverse temperature β, 2C = β, and in the limit as γ → 0 the equilibrium phase
diagram exhibits a van der Waals phase transition for all C > 0.5. The addition of
the extra sites 0 and L + 1 in the deﬁnition of the CA simulates the action of the two
reservoirs which after each time step put a new particle at 0 and at L with probability
ρ− and respectively ρ+. The action of the reservoirs is however twofold: in fact, besides
the aforementioned insertion of particles in the channel with probabilities ρ+ and ρ−, it
also enters in the deﬁnition of x,γ, where the occupation numbers at y > L and y < 1 are
replaced by the average reservoir densities ρ+ and, respectively, ρ−.
We have run several Monte Carlo simulations for diﬀerent values of the parameters deﬁning
the CA, we report here results in the case C = 1.25, γ−1 = 30, L = 600 and ρ− < ρ+ =
1 − ρ−. We have computed the local particles density ρ(x, t) by taking the time average
ηs(x), ηs(x) the number of particles at x at time s, T = L2; however, instead
of ρ(x, t) we have plotted m(r, t) = 2ρ(γ−1r, t) − 1, thus the unit space length becomes
γ−1 (the interaction range) and the density is written in “magnetization variables” so that
the magnetization at the endpoints is m+ = −m−.
In Fig. 1 we report what observed when m± = ±1 while the initial conﬁguration has

mβ and m∗ have values mβ = 0.985 and m∗ = 0.775. The diﬀerent curves in the plot correspond to the
averaged magnetization computed at diﬀerent times: t = 105 (empty squares), t = 106 (ﬁlled squares),
t = 107 (empty circles) and t = 108 (ﬁlled circles). The black thin line denotes the initial conﬁguration,
corresponding to a step function centered at r = 15.

m0,x = −1 for x ≤ 3L/4 and m0,x = +1 elsewhere. On the time scale L2 we see the
initial step to smoothen out: the proﬁle becomes a curve starting on the left at m− = 1
and increasing slowly, almost linearly, till 3L/4 where it has a value ≈ −mβ, mβ = 0.985,
then there is a transition region where the magnetization increases quite abruptly from
−mβ to mβ; afterwards the proﬁle goes again slowly, almost linearly, up to m+ = 1 which
is reached at the right endpoint. As time increases the proﬁle moves rigidly towards the

it remains unchanged except for small ﬂuctuations. In the next section we will interpret
the values ±mβ as the equilibrium magnetization densities when the inverse temperature
is β = 2C.

If we decrease m+ till mβ we see the same pattern with a transition region which is
essentially unchanged and the quasi linear parts with a smaller slope. However if m+
decreases past mβ keeping m+ > m∗ = 0.775 we see a completely diﬀerent picture (as
argued in the next section, the values |m| ≤ m∗ are to be regarded as unstable, m∗ <
|m| < mβ as metastable, and |m| ≥ m∗ as stable). In Fig. 2 we report simulations with

curves in the plot have the same meaning of those illustrated in Fig. 1. The initial datum is a step function

centered at r = 10.

m+ = 0.93. We start now from an initial conﬁguration which has m0,x = −1 for x ≤ L/2
and m0,x = +1 elsewhere. We observe, after a short transient, a pattern similar to the
one in Fig. 1, i.e. with a transition region around the middle which is very similar to
the previous one. To its right and left there are again approximately linear proﬁles but
now they are decreasing (because m+ < mβ). In contrast to the previous case as time
increases on the scale L2 the transition region moves away from the middle and on times
L3 it “collides” with an endpoint of the channel:
in Fig. 2 it is represented by a bump
on the right of the channel where the magnetization rapidly increases from −mβ to m+,
m+ the magnetization forced by the right reservoir. If we change the seed of the random
generator we may as well see the bump on the left. Such a proﬁle seems stationary as it
stays unchanged (modulo small ﬂuctuations) for very long times, our longest simulation
has t = 1011.

Besides the magnetization proﬁles, we have also measured the current by summing (with
sign) the total number of particles which in a time interval T at each time step enter into
the system from site 0 to site 1 minus those which exit from the channel going from site
1 to site 0. As the current is small, of the order 10−5, to have reliable values we had
to use longer time averages, T ≈ L3. For values m+ > mβ the CA reaches a stationary
pattern (on the time scale of our simulations) with a negative current (ﬂowing from L
toward 1) which is proportional to 1/L. The magnetization is increasing and essentially
linear away from the short transition region and, in agreement with the Fick’s law, the

section for more details. Without bias (i.e. C = 0) the slope would be all the way linear
and therefore the current larger, as shown in Fig. 3 (when C = 0 the values mβ and m∗
do not play any role and the thick black dashed lines corresponding to ±mβ and ±m∗
are drawn only to permit an easier comparison with Fig. 2). Thus the eﬀect of the latent

curves in the plot have the same meaning as in Fig. 1. The initial datum is a step function centered at

r = 10. The standard Fourier law is satisﬁed.

heat, responsible for the occurrence of the transition region, is to reduce the conductivity
of the system.

The eﬀect becomes dramatic once we reach values of m+ as those illustrated in Fig. 2. In
this regime the current becomes positive, it goes from the left where the density is smaller
to the right where the density is larger. The proﬁle is essentially linear away from the
bump but it is now decreasing, hence the change in direction of the current. The Fick’s
law is still satisﬁed as the current goes opposite to the gradient (except in the transition
region which however occupies a small fraction of the volume) and the overall eﬀect is
that the reservoir with smaller density gives mass to the one with larger density. Same
phenomenon is observed for other initial conditions and /or diﬀerent seeds of the random
generator.

3 Mesoscopic limit

To interpret the above simulations we will relate our CA to particle models used in non-
equilibrium statistical mechanics. The connection comes by studying the mesoscopic limit
(described below) of the CA which we argue (but do not have yet a proof) to be the
same as that obtained in the same limit from a particle system with Kawasaki dynamics
involving Kac potentials.
The mesoscopic limit describes the evolution of the system in the limit γ → 0 when space
is scaled by γ−1 and time by γ−2. Thus L = γ−1(cid:96) with (cid:96) > 0 ﬁxed independently of γ, (cid:96)
is the mesoscopic length of the channel. Let η(x, v; t) be the occupation number at (x, v)
and at time t and call uγ(x, v; t) = E[η(x, v; t)] the average particle number at x, v; t. We

(3.6)–(3.7) have been derived in [2] as the mesoscopic limit of an Ising model with Kawasaki
dynamics and Kac potential Jγ(x, y) = γJ(γx, γ, y) (in [2] the system is in a torus, the
case d > 1 is also covered). Thus the interaction term x,γ in the simulations can be
regarded as a force due to an attractive pair Kac potential.

The Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional can be seen as a local approximation of
F (m) when J(x, y) becomes a delta function, so that the non local term in F (m) becomes
a gradient squared. Correspondingly, the conservative gradient ﬂow for Ginzburg-Landau,
which is the Cahn-Hilliard equation, is a local approximation of the conservative gradient

ﬂow for F (m) which is (3.6)–(3.7) and in this sense our CA simulates the Cahn-Hilliard
equation. The van der Waals free energy associated to F (m) is

see Fig. 4.
For β > 1 this is a double well potential with minima at ±mβ where mβ is the positive
root of the mean ﬁeld equation

(3.9)

The van der Waals- Maxwell free energy is the convex envelope f∗∗
β (m) of fβ(m), which is
constantly equal to fβ(mβ) in the interval [−mβ, mβ] and it is equal to fβ(m) elsewhere.
The values |m| ≥ mβ are stable. The values |m| ∈ (m∗, mβ) are metastable,

(3.10)
while the values |m| ≤ m∗ are unstable. In the stable and metastable regions fβ(m) is
convex, in the unstable region it is concave.

m∗ > 0 : β(1 − (m∗)2) = 1

Figure 4: The graph of the excess free energy fβ(m) − fβ(mβ), see Eq. (3.7), as a function of m, for
β = 1.25 > βc = 1.

Let us now go back to (3.7) and given a magnetization proﬁle m(r) deﬁne the molecular
magnetic ﬁeld h(r) as

With these notation (3.7) reads as

h(r) =

which looks like the Fick law for the magnetization current written with the gradient of
the magnetic ﬁeld rather than the gradient of the magnetization density. However the
relation between the magnetic ﬁeld h(r) and the magnetization density m(r) is not given
by the thermodynamic relation between magnetization and magnetic ﬁeld, in particular
it is non local. To gain locality and the correct relation we should go from the mesoscopic
to the macroscopic description of the system in the limit when (cid:96) → ∞ and with space
rescaled by a factor (cid:96)−1.

-1-mb-m*0m*mb+1The simulations seem to indicate that in this limit the mesoscopic proﬁle (in the context of
Fig. 2) becomes a smooth almost linear decreasing proﬁle starting from the left endpoint
where it has value m− and converging to −mβ at the right endpoint, here there is a
boundary layer eﬀect as the bump shrinks to a point in the macroscopic variables. Thus
except for a set of Lebesgue measure 0 (the point to which the transition region shrinks) the
proﬁle is monotone (decreasing) and the rescaled current becomes equal to − ∂fβ (m)
∂m(r)
so that the Fick law is satisﬁed. However, the limit proﬁle m(r) is all contained within the
metastable region so that we do not get the true thermodynamic relation which instead
involves f∗∗
β (m). This is the other main unexpected phenomenon which emerges from our
simulations.

Summarizing, the patterns as in Fig. 1 appear when m+ > mβ, those in Fig. 2 when
m+ ∈ (m∗, mβ). The magnetization in the transition region of Fig. 1 goes from ≈ −mβ
to ≈ +mβ; in the bump of Fig. 2 the magnetization goes from ≈ −mβ to m+. In [3] it is
proved that (3.5) has (for (cid:96) large enough) a stationary solution as in Fig. 1; it is also shown
that when m+ ∈ (m∗, mβ) there is a stationary solution with the transition region in the
middle and positive current, but our simulations show that such a proﬁle is unstable so
that the CA does not see it except in a transient. We conjecture that arguments similar
to those used in [3] could prove the existence of stationary solutions with a bump. Such
a result is proved in [4]–[5] in the semi-inﬁnite case where (cid:96) → ∞ and using Neumann
reﬂecting conditions in the deﬁnition of the Kac interaction.

We have an indirect proof of the validity of our conjecture on the mesoscopic limit via
the measure of the limit current j. Recall that we have measured the current by taking
the time average of the number of particles which at each time step jump from 0 into the
system minus those which exit from the channel by jumping to 0. In the context of Fig. 2
and taking the averaging time T equal to T = L3, we have obtained j = 3.97 × 10−5.
Supposing the proﬁle m(r) stationary then j should be close to γI (the factor γ is due to
the change of scales in the mesoscopic limit) where I is as in (3.6)–(3.7) and computed
using m(r). One can check that if m(r) is a stationary solution of (3.5) in [0, (cid:96)] and
there is an interval [r1, r2], r2 − r1 > 4 where m is negative and such that ∂m(r)
β(1 − m(r)2) ≤ 1 for r ∈ [r1, r2], then I ∈ [I−, I+] where

4.78 × 10−5 while the current computed in the simulation is j = 3.97 × 10−5.
Conclusions. Our simulations seem to indicate that in systems which undergo a phase
transition of van der Waals type we may see in the heat conduction experiment for a long
time a current ﬂowing from the reservoir with smaller order parameter to the one with
the higher value and thus construct machines as described at the end of the introduction.
