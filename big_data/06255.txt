OPEN QUANTUM RANDOM WALKS AND THE MEAN HITTING TIME FORMULA

CARLOS F. LARDIZABAL

Abstract. We make use of the Open Quantum Random Walk setting due to S. Attal, F. Petruccione, C. Sabot and I.
Sinayskiy [J. Stat. Phys. (2012) 147:832-852] in order to discuss a quantum version of the Mean Hitting Time Formula
from classical probability theory. We study an open quantum notion of hitting probability on a ﬁnite collection of sites
and with this we are able to describe the problem in terms of linear maps and its matrix representations. After setting
an open quantum version of the fundamental matrix for ergodic Markov chains we are able to prove our main result
and as consequence a version of the Random Target Lemma. We also study a mean hitting time formula in terms of
the minimal polynomial associated to the matrix representation of the quantum walk. We conclude with a discussion
comparing the classical and the quantum case together with open questions.

1. Introduction

In this work we are interested in probabilistic aspects of certain open quantum systems [9]. Informally, the term
open means that the system of interest is not isolated from the environment and as such it is subject to interference.
Then instead of having a unitary evolution (as in ideal quantum dynamics), we are presented with a dissipative
system which is described by certain Lindblad equations [3, 9, 22] and its solutions given by completely positive maps
(quantum channels) [7, 26].

In the search of quantum counterparts of classical probabilistic notions, one often notices that there may be more
than one reasonable deﬁnition. For instance, the notion of recurrence for quantum systems has received considerable
attention in mathematical physics and in quantum probability literature as several constructions exist, see e.g., [1, 13,
14, 16, 19, 23, 33], each with their own characteristics depending, for instance, on the Hilbert space of interest. In
general these are nonequivalent notions, meaning that a system may be recurrent in one sense but not in another, see
e.g. the discussion in [16].

Let us consider the problem of calculating the average time of ﬁrst visit to a certain site. Consider a ﬁnite state

irreducible Markov chain (Xn : n = 0, 1, . . . ) associated to a stochastic matrix P = (pij). Let

(1.1)

and

(1.2)

Ti := min{n ≥ 0 : Xn = i}

∞(cid:88)

Zij :=

ij − πj),
(p(n)

n=0

where π = (πi) is the unique stationary distribution for P . We call Z = (Zij) the fundamental matrix. Then the
Mean Hitting Time Formula relates these elements in the following way:

(1.3)

(1.4)

πjEiTj = Zjj − Zij

πjEiTj =

Zjj,

This result has a number of consequences, one of them being the Random Target Lemma: for all i,

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

j

so this quantity does not depend on i. Probabilistic proofs of these results can be seen in [2]. In [8], a diﬀerent proof
of (1.3) is presented, relying on probability and matrix analysis arguments.

The goal of the present work is to discuss a version of the Mean Hitting Time Formula in the context of Open
Quantum Random Walks (OQWs). OQWs, a quantum generalization of Markov chains, have been ﬁrst discussed by
S. Attal et al. [4] and since its introduction several articles have appeared concerning its probabilistic and statistical
properties [5, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36]. Hitting times are a central object in the theory
of Markov chains [2, 8, 12, 15, 24] so we may be interested in the diﬀerences (and similarities) between classical and

1

quantum settings. In [20] it has been proposed a notion of hitting time for OQWs and now we recall these constructions
in ﬁnite dimension. Let {Bij}i,j=1,...,k belong to Mn(C), the order n complex matrices, such that for each j = 1, . . . , k,

k(cid:88)

(cid:16) k(cid:88)

(cid:17) ⊗ |i(cid:105)(cid:104)i|.

BijρjB∗

ij

where I denotes the order n identity matrix. We say that k is the number of sites and n is the degree of freedom
on each site. Deﬁne

(1.6)

ρ :=

ρi ⊗ |i(cid:105)(cid:104)i|, ρi ∈ Mn(C), ρi ≥ 0,

T r(ρi) = 1,

k(cid:88)

i=1

where ρi ≥ 0 means that ρi is positive semideﬁnite. For a given initial density matrix of such form, the Open
Quantum Random Walk (OQW) on k sites induced by the Bij, i, j = 1, . . . , k is, by deﬁnition [4], the map

(1.7)

Φ(ρ) :=

such density we have that Φ(ρ) is also a summation of terms of the form ηi ⊗ |i(cid:105)(cid:104)i|, ηi ≥ 0,(cid:80)

Now we remark that density matrices of the form (1.6) are preserved under the action of OQWs. That is, given one
i T r(ηi) = 1, see [4]. In
particular, the sites i = |i(cid:105) serve as an index for the entries in a given vector. We say that Bij is the eﬀect matrix of
transition from site j to site i. If the state of the chain at time n is ρ(n) = ρ ⊗ |j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| then at time n + 1 it jumps to

(1.10)

This is a well-known transition rule seen in quantum mechanics, which depends on a density matrix. In probability
notation, we have a homogeneous Markov chain (ρn, Xn) with values in Dn × {1, . . . , k} (continuous state, discrete
time), where Dn consists of the set of density matrices on Mn(C) (see [4, 20]), satisfying: from any position (ρ, j) one
jumps to

with probability given by (1.9). This is the quantum trajectories formalism of OQWs. Informally, we have an open
quantum process for which we perform measurements at each time step, that is, we have a monitored procedure. Also
it is worth noting that the dynamics of OQWs are quite diﬀerent from the usual (closed) quantum random walks, we
refer the reader to [27] and [35] for more on this kind of walk.

In order to obtain an OQW version of the Mean Hitting Time Formula, we need to address the following points.

1. We need a notion of hitting probability for OQWs. We adopt the following, described in [20].

Deﬁnition 1.1. The probability of ﬁrst visit to site i at time r, starting at ρj ⊗ |j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| is denoted by br(ρj; i).
This is the sum of the traces of all paths starting at ρj ⊗ |j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| and reaching i for the ﬁrst time at the r-th step. The
probability starting from ρj ⊗ |j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| that the walk ever hits site i is

∞(cid:88)

br(ρj; i),

i (cid:54)= j

(1.11)

hij(ρj) :=

and hjj(ρj) := 1. This is the probability of visiting site i, given that the walk started at site j.

r=0

Deﬁnition 1.2. For ﬁxed initial state and ﬁnal site, the mean hitting time is

(1.12)

kij(ρj) :=

r br(ρj; i).

∞(cid:88)

r=1

2

2. A second step is to write expressions of hitting times in matrix terms. Let π(i ← j; r) be the set of all
products of matrices corresponding to the sequences of sites that a walk is allowed to perform with Φ, beginning
at site |j(cid:105), ﬁrst reaching site |i(cid:105) in r steps. For instance, reading matrices and indices from right to left, we have
B43B32B21B12B21 ∈ π(4 ← 1; 5) as this corresponds to moving right, moving left and then moving right 3 times. Let
π(i ← j) = ∪rπ(i ← j; r). Then, by deﬁnition,

(1.13)

and

(1.14)

br(ρj; i) =

T r(CρjC∗)

C∈π(i←j;r)

T r(CρjC∗) =

(cid:88)

C∈π(i←j)

T r(CρjC∗)

If C ∈ Mn(C), deﬁne MC : Mn(C) → Mn(C),
(1.15)

MC(X) := CXC∗, X ∈ Mn(C)

For simplicity, assume k = 2. Let

(1.16)

ˆH =

(cid:21)

We give the analogous deﬁnition for k > 2 sites. In words, ˆhij denotes the map associated with summing all possible
ways of going from |j(cid:105) to |i(cid:105). Then for every density ρj we have, by the deﬁnition of ˆhij,

(1.17)

hij(ρj) = T r(ˆhijρj)

In a similar way as in the deﬁnition for the hitting probability operator ˆH, deﬁne the mean hitting time operator

and note that

(1.19)

kij(ρj) = T r(ˆkijρj),

i (cid:54)= j,

and we set kii(ρ) = 0 for every ρ density, since we begin counting visits at time zero, as in eq. (1.1). We give the
analogous deﬁnition for k > 2 sites.

(cid:80)n
3. It is then necessary to deﬁne an OQW version of the fundamental matrix of ergodic Markov chains [2, 8]. Let ˆΩ
i,j=1 Eij ⊗ Eij, for k, l = 1, . . . , n and Eij ∈ Mn(C)
denote the block matrix where each block entry equals ˆΩkl = 1
kn
are the matrix units: (Eij)rs = 1 if (r, s) = (i, j), and equals zero otherwise. Note that ˆΩ2 = ˆΩ. The idea behind
this deﬁnition is that there are OQWs such that the iterates of its block representation converge to ˆΩ. This should be
compared with the fact that the columns (rows) of a stochastic matrix corresponding to ﬁnite irreducible aperiodic
Markov chains converge to the unique stationary probability vector. Properties on ˆΩ will be discussed later in this
work. Let

(1.20)

E := {Φ OQW : ˆΦr → ˆΩ, r → ∞},

where the convergence is in the sense of entrywise convergence of the associated matrix representations (to be discussed
later). We call E the collection of ergodic OQWs, which is the set of OQWs such that its iterates converge to a
unique asymptotic limit, described by ˆΩ, regardless of its initial state. Then we can deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 1.3. (Fundamental matrix of ergodic OQWs). For every Φ ∈ E acting on a ﬁnite collection of sites, deﬁne

(1.21)

ˆZ := ˆI +

( ˆΦr − ˆΩ) = ( ˆI − ˆΦ + ˆΩ)−1

(cid:88)

r≥1

That this deﬁnition makes sense in the set E will be discussed in the following sections. See also [34] for a related

discussion on this map in the context of quantum channels. We may state the main result of this work.

Theorem 1.4. (Mean hitting time formula for OQWs). Let Φ denote a ﬁnite ergodic OQW with degree of freedom
n ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2 sites and let ˆZ denote its fundamental matrix. Let ˆD be the diagonal matrix operator with diagonal
entries ˆkii and let ˆN := ˆK − ˆD. Then for every ρ density matrix, for all i, j = 1, . . . , k,
(1.22)

T r( ˆNijρ) = T r([( ˆD ˆZ)ii − ( ˆD ˆZ)ij]ρ)

Corollary 1.5. If ˆD is invertible then

(1.23)

T r(( ˆD−1 ˆN )ijρ) = T r([ ˆZii − ˆZij]ρ)

Expression (1.23) should be compared with (1.3).

(cid:88)

Corollary 1.6. (Random Target Lemma for OQWs). For all j, ρ density matrix, the expression

(1.24)

t(cid:12)(ρ) :=

T r(( ˆD−1 ˆN )ijρ)

does not depend on j.

i

Expression (1.24) should be compared with (1.4). The number t(cid:12)(ρ) will be called the target time of the OQW

with respect to the initial density ρ.

Based on a result due to H. Chen and F. Zhang [12], we discuss another mean hitting time formula in Section 7.
Such result makes use of the minimal polynomial of the associated stochastic matrix. In our setting the proof is a
simple adaptation of the mentioned work, taking in consideration the mean hitting time formula for OQWs.
Theorem 1.7. (Mean hitting time formula in terms of the minimal polynomial). Let Φ ∈ E with degree of freedom
n ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2 sites, let ˆD be the diagonal matrix operator with diagonal entries ˆkii and let ˆN := ˆK − ˆD. We have,
for all ρ density matrix, for all i, j = 1, . . . , k,

polynomial for Φ.

In this work we will consider mostly OQWs with k = 2 sites and degree of freedom given by order n = 2 matrices
as this case already presents nontrivial aspects. Generalizations of the deﬁnitions and corresponding proofs for higher
dimensions are straightforward. The validity of certain statements for n, k > 2 sites are discussed separately whenever
necessary.

The structure of this work is as follows. In Section 2 we review completely positive maps (quantum channels) and
basic properties of OQWs, including calculation of probabilities in such setting. We discuss the block form, the matrix
representation of OQWs and the relation between them. In Section 3 we prove basic properties of the fundamental
matrix for OQWs and in Section 4 we make a remark on calculations of hitting probabilities. In Section 5 we prove
Theorem 1.4. The structure of the proof of this theorem is inspired by [2] and [8] and we also consider a numerical
example. In Section 6 we prove Corollary 1.6 and in Section 7 we prove Theorem 1.7. We conclude with a discussion
comparing the classical and the quantum calculation of hitting times, together with some open questions in Section 8.

2. Open Quantum Random Walks and representations

We review basic facts about completely positive maps, more details of which can be seen for instance in [7]. Let
Φ : Mn(C) → Mn(C) be a linear map on the algebra of order n matrices with complex coeﬃcients. Recall that a matrix
A ∈ Mn(C) is positive semideﬁnite if A∗ = A and (cid:104)Av, v(cid:105) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ Cn, and we denote this fact by A ≥ 0. We say
Φ is a positive operator whenever A ≥ 0 implies Φ(A) ≥ 0. Deﬁne for each k ≥ 1, Φk : Mk(Mn(C)) → Mk(Mn(C)),

We say Φ is k-positive if Φk is positive, and we say Φ is completely positive (CP) if Φk is positive for every
k = 1, 2, 3, . . . . We have that CP maps can be written in the Kraus form [7]: there are Bi ∈ Mn(C) such that

(2.2)

Φ(ρ) =

i Bi = I, or
i = I. Trace-preserving completely
positive (CPT) maps are also called quantum channels in mathematical physics literature [22, 26]. Also recall that
if A ∈ Mn(C) there is the corresponding vector representation vec(A) associated to it, given by stacking together the
matrix rows. For instance, if n = 2,

We say Φ is trace-preserving if T r(Φ(ρ)) = T r(ρ) for all ρ ∈ Mn(C), which is equivalent to (cid:80)
Φ∗(I) = I. We say Φ is unital if Φ(I) = I, which is equivalent to (cid:80)

The vec mapping satisﬁes vec(AXBT ) = (A ⊗ B)vec(X) for any A, B, X square matrices (see [17], noting that in
such reference vec means stacking the matrix columns instead of rows) so in particular, vec(BXB∗) = vec(BXB
) =
(B ⊗ B)vec(X), from which we can obtain the matrix representation [Φ] for the CP map (2.2):

and given any matrix V ∈ Mn(C) we deﬁne [V ] := V ⊗ V ∈ Mn2(C). We recall the well-known fact that the matrix
representation of a CPT map Φ : Mn(C) → Mn(C) is independent of the Kraus representation considered. The proof
of this result is a simple consequence of the unitary equivalence of Kraus matrices for a given quantum channel [26].

With this notation, |v(cid:105)(cid:104)v| denotes the projection map on the direction of v. Let K denote a separable Hilbert space
and let {|i(cid:105)}i∈Z be an orthonormal basis for such space (indexed by the integers in case K is inﬁnite dimensional). The
elements of such basis will be called sites (the vertices of a given graph) and denoted by |i(cid:105), or just i for simplicity.
Let H be another Hilbert space, which will describe the degrees of freedom given at each point of Z. Then we
will consider the space H ⊗ K. For each pair i, j we associate a bounded operator Bij on H. This operator describes
ijBij = I, where, if inﬁnite, such series is

the eﬀect of passing from |j(cid:105) to |i(cid:105). We will assume that for each j, (cid:80)

We will consider density matrices on H ⊗ K with the particular form given by (1.6). For a given initial state
of such form, the Open Quantum Random Walk induced by the Bij is given by (1.7). We note that by deﬁning

if the walk acts on a ﬁnite number of sites. In this work we will assume that H = Cn and K = Ck.

and ρ(0) = ρ0 ⊗ |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| then ρ(1) = Lρ0L∗ ⊗ | − 1(cid:105)(cid:104)−1| + Rρ0R∗ ⊗ |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| and
(2.9)
so the probability of reaching sites | − 2(cid:105), |0(cid:105) and |2(cid:105) in two steps, given that the walk started at site |0(cid:105) with initial
density ρ0 is given by T r(L2ρ0L2∗), T r(LRρ0R∗L∗ + RLρ0L∗R∗) and T r(R2ρ0R2∗), respectively. This is one of the
simplest examples of OQWs. If i is allowed to vary in Z, we have a nearest neighbor OQW on the integer line, with
left and right transitions given by matrices L and R, respectively, these satisfying L∗L + R∗R = I. It is clear that
one may consider site dependent transitions and also more than just nearest neighbor interactions. This setting is also
suitable to consider open quantum walks on graphs.

Remark 2.2. Given an OQW Φ we note that there is a clear identiﬁcation between its block form ˆΦ and its matrix
representation [Φ] and we may consider any of them whenever convenient. In particular, when we talk of convergence
of a sequence of OQWs, we mean the entrywise matrix convergence of [Φ].

Let us make an observation on the density matrices being considered. Suppose Φ is a 2-site OQW with transitions
given by order 2 matrices, Bij ∈ M2(C). Note that a density ρ = ρ1 ⊗ |1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| + ρ2 ⊗ |2(cid:105)(cid:104)2|, ρ1, ρ2 ∈ M2(C), can be
seen simply as a direct sum of eﬀects ρ = (ρ1, ρ2), which in turn may identiﬁed with [vec(ρ1) vec(ρ2)]T and this
corresponds to a vector in C8. Also [Bij] ∈ M4(C), [Φ] will be an order 8 matrix acting on two positive matrices
ρ1, ρ2 ∈ M2(C) and we write for one iteration, via the usual block matrix multiplication,

That is, corresponding to the matrix calculation ρ (cid:55)→ (cid:80)

ij BijρB∗

ij we have the matrix-vector calculation ˆΦ vec(ρ),
where vec(ρ) = [vec(ρ1) vec(ρ2)]T . This is just the algebraic description of having a linear map (matrix) acting on an
element of the vector space (i.e., a column vector). Due to the correspondence between usual matrix multiplication
and block matrix multiplication, we have that vec−1( ˆΦ(vec(ρ))) gives the desired OQW iteration in direct sum of
matrices once again. It is not diﬃcult to show that the probability of reaching site |j(cid:105) at time r, given that the walk
has started at site |i(cid:105), with initial density matrix ρi equals
(2.16)
Clearly, the price to pay for avoiding left and right multiplications of the form V ρV ∗ is the use of the vec representation
and then its inverse. For the sake of simplicity, formula (2.16) will not used in this work and we will prefer to use the
simpler expressions with the conjugation maps MBi. Nevertheless, we will occasionally show the explicit form of [Φ]
for certain examples, with the purpose of gaining some calculational intuition.

Pi,j;ρ(r) = T r(vec−1[Φr

ji]vec(ρi))

2.4. Example: PQ-matrices. An order n matrix is a PQ-matrix if it is a permutation of some diagonal matrix.
Denote by P Qn the set of such matrices in Mn(C). For instance, P Q2 consists of all matrices which are diagonal
(aij = 0 if i (cid:54)= j) or antidiagonal (aii = 0 for all i). Of course, for n ≥ 3 the set P Qn allows for many other possibilities.
One property possessed by PQ-matrices is the fact that if V1 ··· Vk is any product of PQ-matrices and X is any matrix
then the expressions T r(V XV ∗) do not depend on nondiagonal entries of X, this being of computational convenience.
Despite its simplicity, such objects may be used to describe dynamics which cannot be performed by classical Markov
chains.

Remark 2.3. In terms of CP maps, one may consider PQ-quantum channels, i.e., a channel which admits a Kraus
decomposition where each element is a PQ-matrix [19]. Clearly not every quantum channel is of this kind. These are
among the simplest quantum channels and there are many examples in the literature, we refer the reader to [19] for
more information.

Example 2.4. A basic class of examples consist of OQWs acting on 2 sites, where the action on the densities occur
via order 2 PQ-matrices. For instance, let {A, B} be order 2 PQ-matrices assuming that A = (aij) is diagonal and
B = (bij) is antidiagonal. This implies a particular form for [A] and [B]. If A∗A + B∗B = I we may deﬁne, for
instance, the following OQW:

Note that ˆΩ2 = ˆΩ. The idea behind this deﬁnition is that there are OQWs such that the iterates of its block
representation converge to ˆΩ. This should be compared with the fact that the columns (rows) of a stochastic matrix
corresponding to ﬁnite irreducible aperiodic Markov chains converge to the unique stationary probability vector. Note
that ˆΩ has as ﬁxed point the density

( ˆΦr − ˆΩ) = ( ˆI − ˆΦ + ˆΩ)−1

The following will be needed later in this work.
Lemma 3.1. Let Φ ∈ E. Then a) ˆZ ˆΩ = ˆΩ ˆZ = ˆΩ. b) ˆZ(I − ˆΦ) = ˆI − ˆZ ˆΩ = ˆI − ˆΩ. c) ( ˆI − ˆΦ) ˆZ = ˆI − ˆΩ ˆZ = ˆI − ˆΩ
Proof. a) Write ˆZ( ˆI − ˆΦ + ˆΩ) = ˆI so ˆZ − ˆZ ˆΦ + ˆZ ˆΩ = ˆI, with ˆI given by (3.6). Right multiply by ˆΩ on both sides,

so

(3.11)

By (3.4), we get

ˆZ ˆΩ − ˆZ ˆΦ ˆΩ + ˆZ ˆΩ ˆΩ = I ˆΩ

(3.12)
The proof of the other equality is similar. b) Just note that ( ˆI − ˆΦ + ˆΩ) ˆZ = ˆI, so ( ˆI − ˆΦ) ˆZ = ˆI − ˆΩ ˆZ = ˆI − ˆΩ, the
proof of the other equality being similar. The proof of c) is similar to b).

ˆZ ˆΩ − ˆZ ˆΩ + ˆZ ˆΩ = ˆΩ =⇒ ˆZ ˆΩ = ˆΩ

The above resoning holds for k > 2 sites. We note again that in OQWs, when we specify that a walk is located at a
certain site |j(cid:105), one should also indicate the matrix degree of freedom on that site. We denote this by ρj ⊗ |j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| (see
expression (1.6)).

We have concluded:
Lemma 5.1. Let Φ denote a ﬁnite ergodic OQW and let ˆZ denote its fundamental matrix. Let ˆK be given as above.
Let ˆD = ˆD = diag(ˆk11, . . . , ˆknn) and let ˆL := ˆK − ( ˆK − ˆD) ˆΦ. Then if ρj is a density matrix concentrated on site j
then for all i and all c ∈ R, T r( ˆLijcρj) = T r(cρj) = c.

From the lemma above we have, for instance, T r( ˆL12ρ) = T r(ρ) for ρ density matrix on site 2. This kind of
calculation can be used to recover the classical case. In fact, if ρ is a density matrix then for an OQW acting on 2
sites,

(5.6)

(5.7)

1 = T r(ˆk11ρ) − T r(ˆk12MB21ρ) =⇒ k11(ρ) = 1 + k12(MB21 ρ),
1 = T r(ˆk12ρ) − T r(ˆk12MB22ρ) =⇒ k12(ρ) = 1 + k12(MB22ρ)

That is, we have obtained a density dependent version of the classical minimality theorem for mean hitting times. If
we choose the Bij as multiples of the identity then the above equations become particular expressions of the result for
mean hitting times for classical Markov chains [15, 20]:

Lemma 5.2. Let Φ denote a ﬁnite ergodic OQW and let ˆZ denote its fundamental matrix. Let ˆK be given by (1.18).
Let ˆD := diag(ˆk11, . . . , ˆknn), ˆL := ˆK − ( ˆK − ˆD) ˆΦ and ˆN := ˆK − ˆD. Then

Proof. Below we use order 2 matrix notations for simplicity. We have

ˆL = ˆK − ˆN ˆΦ =⇒ ˆN ˆΦ + ˆL = ˆN + ˆD

(5.10)
Apply ˆZ to both sides, so
(5.11)
By Lemma 3.1, (I − ˆΦ) ˆZ = I − ˆΩ, so ˆN (I − ˆΦ) ˆZ = ˆN (I − ˆΩ) = ˆN − ˆN ˆΩ, and by (5.11) we get
(5.12)
Now note that the product ˆN ˆΩ is of the form

ˆN ˆΦ ˆZ + ˆL ˆZ = ˆN ˆZ + ˆD ˆZ =⇒ ˆN (I − ˆΦ) ˆZ = ˆL ˆZ − ˆD ˆZ

ˆN − ˆN ˆΩ = ˆL ˆZ − ˆD ˆZ =⇒ ˆN = ˆL ˆZ − ˆD ˆZ + ˆN ˆΩ

so we can write ( ˆN ˆΩ)ij = ( ˆN ˆΩ)i, that is, only the row choice matters (it is clear that this fact on expression (5.13) is
also valid for any number of sites). Therefore from

(5.14)

we get

ˆN = ˆL ˆZ − ˆD ˆZ + ˆN ˆΩ

ˆNij = ( ˆL ˆZ)ij − ( ˆD ˆZ)ij + ( ˆN ˆΩ)i

Then if i = j we get 0 = ˆNij = ( ˆL ˆZ)jj − ( ˆD ˆZ)jj + ( ˆN ˆΩ)j from which we get ( ˆN ˆΩ)i = ( ˆD ˆZ)ii − ( ˆL ˆZ)ii. Finally, for
i (cid:54)= j, we get

ˆNij = ( ˆL ˆZ)ij − ( ˆD ˆZ)ij + ( ˆN ˆΩ)i = ( ˆL ˆZ)ij − ( ˆD ˆZ)ij + ( ˆD ˆZ)ii − ( ˆL ˆZ)ii

The matrix calculations for k > 2 sites are similar.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. We begin with

ˆNij = ( ˆD ˆZ)ii − ( ˆD ˆZ)ij +

( ˆL ˆZ)ij − ( ˆL ˆZ)ii

(5.19)
By Lemma 5.1, if ρ is a density matrix concentrated on site j then for all i and all c ∈ R, we have T r( ˆLijcρ) =
T r(cρ) = c. Also note that ˆZijρ is positive semideﬁnite (thus implying that it is a multiple of a density matrix). In
particular, by using (5.17), (5.18) and the fact that ˆZ is trace preserving, we have for ρ positive semideﬁnite that

T r(( ˆL ˆZ)11ρ) = T r(( ˆL11 ˆZ11 + ˆL12 ˆZ21)ρ) = T r( ˆL11 ˆZ11ρ) + T r( ˆL12 ˆZ21ρ)

(5.20)

and similarly

= T r( ˆZ11ρ) + T r( ˆZ21ρ) = T r

= T r(ρ)

T r(( ˆL ˆZ)12ρ) = T r(( ˆL11 ˆZ12 + ˆL12 ˆZ22)ρ) = T r( ˆL11 ˆZ12ρ) + T r( ˆL12 ˆZ22ρ)

= T r( ˆZ12ρ) + T r( ˆZ22ρ) = T r

(5.21)
We conclude that T r(( ˆL ˆZ)11ρ) = T r(( ˆL ˆZ)12ρ) and the result follows. The proof that T r(( ˆL ˆZ)21ρ) = T r(( ˆL ˆZ)22ρ) is
identical. The proof is independent of n and the general case of k > 2 follows from the corresponding versions of eqs.
(5.17) and (5.18).

(5.24)

T r( ˆN12ρ) = T r(( ˆD ˆZ)11ρ) − T r(( ˆD ˆZ)12ρ)

6. Proof of Corollary 1.6

The idea of the proof is the same as for the classical case. We recall that in the classical theory of Markov chains,

if Z is the fundamental matrix given in the introduction, then

(6.1)

From the mean hitting time formula πjEiTj = Zjj − Zij, if we sum over j we get
(6.2)

πjEiTj =

Zjj

Zij = 0, ∀ i

that is, the left hand side does not depend on i. Now recall the deﬁnition of Z for ergodic OQWs and write the mean
hitting time formula for OQWs:

T r(( ˆD−1 ˆN )ijρ) = T r( ˆZiiρ) − T r( ˆZijρ)

(6.3)
The trace preservation of ˆZ, eq.(5.16), implies that
(6.4)

(cid:88)

and so by summing in i both sides of (6.3) we get that

(6.5)

t(cid:12)(ρ) :=

T r( ˆZijρ) = 1

7. Proof of Theorem 1.7

♦

In this section we will prove a mean hitting time formula for ﬁnite ergodic OQWs, inspired by the result due to H.
Chen and F. Zhang [12] for irreducible Markov chains. Such proof consists of 3 preliminary results, followed by the
main theorem. We will follow the same strategy, pointing out similarities and providing the corresponding proof for
matrix representations of CPT maps when required.

By the minimal polynomial of an ergodic OQW Φ we mean the one associated to its matrix representation. That
is, the monic polynomial p of least degree such that p([Φ]) = 0. Since 1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, we see that
p is of the form p(x) = (x − 1)f (x) and we write
(7.1)

f (x) = xr + a1xr−1 + a2xr−2 + ··· + ar−1x + ar

13

In [12] it has been shown that the row vectors of the matrix f (P ) are similar. The result is also true in the case of
matrix representation of ergodic OQWs (in the place of irreducible stochastic matrices), the reasoning being almost
the same as the one presented in [12]. For completeness we describe here the simple adaptation of the proof.

Lemma 7.1. The row vectors of f ([Φ]) are similar.

Proof. As p(x) = (x − 1)f (x) is the minimal polynomial of [Φ] we obtain [Φ]f ([Φ]) − f ([Φ]) = 0, that is,
[Φ]f ([Φ]) = f ([Φ]), so each column of f ([Φ]) is an eigenvector of Φ corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Being ergodic,
each column of f ([Φ]) must be equal to a multiple of

(7.2)

The lemma follows.

u = vec([I I ··· I]T ),

I = In

(cid:3)

Remark 7.2. If in the proof of the above Lemma we have, for instance, k = 3 sites and n = 2 then

(7.3)

u = vec([I2 I2 I2]T ) = [1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1]T

Now we state the second lemma, noting that the result holds for any polynomial.

Lemma 7.3. [12] Let f (x) = xr + a1xr−1 + a2xr−2 + ··· + ar−1x + ar, and
(7.4)
Then for any m ≥ 0 there exists a polynomial qm(x) of degree m and a row vector αm = (αm,1, αm,2, . . . , αm,r) such
that

α0 = (−a1,−a2, . . . ,−ar), β = (xr−1, xr−2, . . . , x, 1)T

xr+m = qm(x)f (x) + αmβ, αm = α0M m,

Now we state the third lemma in terms of matrix representations of quantum channels.

Lemma 7.4. Let Φ be a ﬁnite ergodic OQW, let (x − 1)f (x) denote the minimal polynomial of ˆΦ and f (x) =
a0xr + a1xr−1 + a2xr−2 + ··· + ar−1x + ar. Then

8. Classical versus quantum hitting times: open questions

Consider the classical problem of walking from vertex 1 to vertex k on the k-path, the graph consisting of a single
path of k vertices. Let ki,j, j < i be the mean hitting time of reaching i, starting from j. Suppose the border sites
are repelling and the remaining ones possess fair transitions (p = 1/2). Then clearly k21 = 1 and

(8.1)

ki+1,i =

· 1 +

1
2

1
2

· (1 + ki,i−1 + ki+1,i), 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1

This equality reads as follows: either we move right to site i + 1 and we are done (with probability 1/2), or else we
move left and so we need 1 unit of time (the one spent moving left) plus the mean time of moving right twice (this
also occurring with probability 1/2). It is a simple matter to solve this recursion and show that the expected time for
a random walk starting at 1 to reach site k is (k − 1)2, that is, O(k2).

A natural question in the context of OQWs is: given L, R matrices such that L∗L + R∗R = I, how is the behavior
of the mean hitting time for the open walk on the k-path associated to L and R? Note that the OQW setting has the
2. We may rephrase our question: are there any choices
classical problem as a particular case: choose L = R = I/
of L and R such that they are fair (induces equal probability to both sides) and such that the mean hitting time is
diﬀerent from the classical case?

br(ρj; i) =

so in principle one way of calculating this number is counting all possible paths and obtain the associated probabilities.
In most cases, this procedure is unpractical even for an OQW acting on order 2 densities in the k-path, as general
products of L’s and R’s are diﬃcult to control. One situation for which counting paths is feasible is when we can
obtain some pattern in the multiplications of L and R. For instance, consider

(8.3)
Note that L∗L+R∗R = I and, even though LR (cid:54)= RL, it is not diﬃcult to recognize a pattern for the trace of products
of L and R. Write a density matrix as

A calculation shows that for the 3-path, we have k31(ρ) = 4 + 2x1 and in the 4-path we have k41(ρ) = 9 + 2x1. Because
of this we conjecture that for every k ≥ 2,
(8.6)

kk1(ρ) = (k − 1)2 + 2x1

but a rigorous proof of this fact is, up to our knowledge, unknown. In particular, we have a mean hitting time that
may depend on the initial density matrix, but its presence (at least in the case of order 2 densities) does not produce
large changes from the classical case. One could then be interested in diﬀerent choices of L and R. Note that (8.3)
is obtained from dividing the Hadamard matrix in two pieces, so one could try to divide other unitary maps in two
(fair) pieces and attempt a similar calculation. One notes that we are still able to obtain a multiplication pattern,
that is, if we let

then we can show that for n = 1, 2, . . . ,
(8.8)

T r(LnρLn∗) = |xn−1|2(cid:2)ρ11|x|2 + 2Re(ρ12xy) + ρ22|y|2(cid:3), T r(RnρRn∗) = |wn−1|2(cid:2)ρ11|z|2 + 2Re(ρ12zw) + ρ22|w|2(cid:3),

and from this and similar calculations we obtain the appropriate multiplication patterns. We believe the problem of
calculating the mean hitting time for the OQW on the k-path associated to the pair of matrices (8.7) is also an open
question, as it includes conjecture (8.6) as a particular case.

As an additional comment on eq. (8.6), the following is a natural question. Can one obtain matrices L, R with
L∗L + R∗R = I such that they are fair in some sense and such that these produce a more signiﬁcant gain in the mean
hitting time? Perhaps this may need to involve matrices which are more complicated than the ones of the form (8.7)
so, apparently, a path counting argument seems to be unfeasible. As it is well known, there are notions of quantum
hitting times for closed quantum walks on ﬁnite graphs which are at least quadratically smaller than the classical
hitting time of a random walk on the same graph [27]. What are then the possible outcomes for mean hitting times
for OQWs presented in this work and how does it compares with its closed quantum counterparts?

16

To conclude, we comment on the target time of OQWs,

(8.9)

t(cid:12)(ρ) :=

T r(( ˆD−1 ˆN )ijρ) = [

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

T r( ˆZiiρ)] − 1

This expression generalizes the classical expression, which in its turn has a clear probabilistic interpretation. On the
other hand, we ask whether this generalized quantity has more information on the quantum dynamics studied in this
work.
In Example 6.1, this quantity is also independent of ρ and so it is a relevant question to ask whether this
happens to every ergodic OQW. We intend to study more on this matter in future publications, together with other
consequences of Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.6.
