HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

RAHELEH JAFARI1 AND SANTIAGO ZARZUELA ARMENGOU2

Abstract. We introduce the concept of homogeneous numerical semigroups and
show that all homogeneous numerical semigroups with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones
are of homogeneous type. In embedding dimension three, we classify all numerical
semigroups of homogeneous type in to numerical semigroups with complete intersec-
tion tangent cones and the homogeneous ones with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones.
We also study the behavior of the homogeneous property by gluing and shiftings to
construct a large family of homogeneous numerical semigroups with Cohen-Macaulay
tangent cones. In particular we show that these properties fulﬁll assymptotically in
the shifting classes. Several explicit examples are provided along the paper to illus-
trate the property.

1. introduction

Let S be a numerical semigroup minimally generated by a sequence of positive in-
tegers n : 0 < n1 < · · · < nd. For any nonnegative integer j one may consider
the shifted sequence n + j : 0 < n1 + j < · · · < nd + j. Let k be a ﬁeld and
k[S] := k[tn1, . . . , tnd] ⊂ k[t], where t is a free variable, be the numerical semigroup ring
deﬁned by S. This is the homogeneous coordinate ring of the aﬃne monomial curve in
k deﬁned parametrically by x1 = tn1, . . . , xd = tnd. Denote by I(n) ⊂ k[x1, . . . , xd] the
Ad
deﬁning ideal of k[S] obtained from the natural presentation k[x1, . . . , xd] → k[S] → 0.
J. Herzog and H. Srinivasan conjectured that for j ≫ 0 the Betti numbers of the ideals
I(n + j) become periodic on j with period nd − n1. In 2013, the conjecture was proven
to be true by A. V. Jayanthan and H. Srinivasan for d = 3 [16], by A. Marzullo for some
particular cases if d = 4 [19], and by P. Gimenez, I. Senegupta and H. Srinivasan in
the case of arithmetic sequences [9]. Finally, in 2014, T. Vu gave a completely general
positive answer in [32]. One of the main ingredients of Vu’s proof is that there exists
a positive integer N such that any minimal binomial non-homogeneous generator of
I(n + j) is of the form xa1
d , where a1, ad are positive integres, u, v are mono-
mials in the variables x2, . . . , xd−1, and deg xa1
d . It is noteworthy that the
bound N depends on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of J(n), the ideal generated
by the homogeneous elements in I(n). Let I(n)∗ be the homogeneous ideal generated
by the initial forms of the elements in I(n). Then, k[x1, . . . , xd]/I(n)∗ ≃ G(S), the
tangent cone of k[S]. By using this main ingredient in Vu’s proof of the conjecture,

J. Herzog and D. I. Stamate proved in [14] that for any j > N, the Betti numbers
of the ideals I(n + j) and I(n + j)∗ coincide. Following the general deﬁnition given
by J. Herzog, M. Rossi, and G. Valla in [13], we say that S if of homogeneous type if
the above condition on the Betti numbers is satisﬁed. So the result of Herzog-Stamate
may be rephrased by saying that S + j is of homogeneous type for any j > N. Note
that if a numerical semigroup S is of homogeneous type then the tangent cone G(S) is
Cohen-Macaulay.

In this paper we introduce a new condition on S, to be homogeneous (cf. Deﬁ-
nition 3.1), that jointly with the Cohen-Macaulay property of G(S) turns out to be
equivalent to a property much similar the one cited above as the main ingredient of Vu’s
proof of the Herzog-Srinivasan conjecture (cf. Theorem 3.12). In fact, this property is
given in terms of the A´pery set of S and so it can be checked in terms of the generating
sequence of integers n. We then show that if S is homogeneous and the tangent cone
G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay, then S is of homogeneous type (cf. Theorem 3.17). Taking
into account that the Cohen-Macaulay property of G(S) can also be checked in terms
of the A´pery set of S, we get a method to prove that a numerical semigroup S is of
homogeneous type that only depends on the A´pery set of S and, ultimately, on ele-
mentary computations on the sequence n. In addition, we prove that there exists a
positive integer L such that for any j > L, all the numerical semigroups generated by
sequences of the form n + j are homogeneous and have Cohen-Macaulay tangent cone
(cf. Corollary 6.4), so in particular they are of homogeneous type. The novelty here
is that the constant L only depends on the sequence of integers n and can be easily
computed. In fact, it can be computed in terms of what we call the shifting type of a
numerical semigroup (cf. Deﬁnition 6.6): two numerical semigroups can be obtained
one from another as a shifting if and only if they have the same shifting type. So our
results say that in the class of numerical semigroups with the same shifting type, all
numerical semigroups except a ﬁnite number, that only depends of its shifting type,
are of homogeneous type.

As a typical example of homogeneous numerical semigroups we have (among several
others) those generated by generalized arithmetic sequences (cf. Example 3.6). In this
case, the tangent cone is also Cohen-Macaulay and so they are of homogeneous type.
For some special cases of the class of numerical semigroups generated by a generalized
arithemtic sequence (namely, for d ≤ 4 or n1 ≤ 2d), this property was proven by
L. Sharifan and R. Zaare-Nahandi by completely diﬀerent methods in [30]. On the other
hand, numerical semigroups of homogeneous type are not necessarily homogeneous.
This is the case for some complete intersection numerical semigroups (cf. Remark 3.16
and Example 3.19). We then explore the diﬀerence between both classes of numerical
semigroups, and found that in embedding dimension 3 any numerical semigroup which
is of homogeneous type has a complete intersection tangent cone or it is homogeneous
with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cone (cf. Theorem 4.5).
In embedding dimension 4
we give several examples illustrating this diﬀerence. In all cases we have checked we
get the same conclusion as in embedding dimension 3, and we ask ourselves if the

HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

same is true for larger embedding dimensions, that is, if any numerical semigroup of
embedding dimension d ≥ 4 which is of homogeneous type, has a complete intersection
tangent cone or it is homogeneous with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cone. By using gluing
techniques we also show that for any embedding dimension d, there are inﬁnitely many
complete intersection numerical semigroups which are of homogeneous type but not
homogeneous (cf. Corollary 5.13).

Now, we brieﬂy describe the content of the paper. All the necessary notations and
machinery on numerical semigroups is introduced and ﬁxed in Section 2. In Section 3
we prove our main results on homogeneous numerical semigroups, characterize them,
and relate with the property of being of homogeneous type. In Section 4 we study in
detail the case of embedding dimension 3 and provide diﬀerent families of examples with
embbedding dimension 4. Then, in Section 5 we study the behavior of the homogeneous
property by gluing, particularly for the case of extensions. Finally, in Section 6 we
study shiftings and prove that the property of being homogeneous and having Cohen-
Macaulay tangent cone fulﬁlls assymptotically in the shifting classes. Many of the
explicit examples along this paper have been computed by using the NumericalSgps
package of GAP [6]

Part of this work has been developed during two stays that the ﬁrst author has done
in the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Barcelona (IMUB) in 2014 and
2016. Both authors would like to thank the IMUB for its hospitality and support. We
also thank Anargyros Katsabekis for several discussions on the subject in the case of
embedding dimension four, and Dumitru Stamate for telling us about his recent results
in [31].

2. preliminaries

Let n : n1, . . . , nd be a sequence of integers with n1 < ni for all i = 2, . . . , d, and
S = hn1, . . . , ndi be the (sub)semigoup of N generated by n. We call S a numerical
semigroup when gcd(n1, . . . , nd) = 1 or equivalently N \ S is a ﬁnite set (cf. [8]). Let k
be a ﬁeld. Then, the sequence n gives rise to a monomial curve C := C(n) ⊆ Ad
k whose
parametrization is given by x1 = tn1, . . . , xd = tnd. Let k[S] := k[tn1, . . . , tnd] ⊂ k[t] be
the semigroup ring generated by S and set P := k[x1, . . . , xd] the polynomial ring over
k. Let I(n) := ker(ϕ), where ϕ : P −→ k[t] is the canonical homomorphism deﬁned
by ϕ(xi) = tni. We have that P/I(n) ≃ k[S] and in the case that S is a numerical
semigroup, or k is algebraically closed, then k[S] is the coordinate ring of C(n) and
[22]). Moreover, if n is a minimal
so I(n) is in fact the deﬁning ideal of C(n) (cf.
system of generators of S, the ideal I(n) only depends on S and we set IS := I(n). Let
g := gcd(n1, . . . , nd). The numerical semigroup assigned to S is deﬁned as

Note that for any positive integer s, we have s ∈ N(S) if and only if gs ∈ S.

N(S) := hn1/g, . . . , nd/gi.

Remark 2.1. The natural ring homomorphism

k[N(S)] = k[tn1/g, . . . , tnd/g] −→ k[tn1, . . . , tnd] = k[S]

is an isomorphism.

Throughout this paper we consider the natural grading on the polynomial ring. For
a vector a = (a1, . . . , ad) of non-negative integers, we use xa to denote the monomial
1 . . . xad
xa1
d . It is known that I(n) is generated by binomials xa − xb where a and b are
d-tuples of non-negative integers with ϕ(a) = ϕ(b). The set {xi | ai + bi 6= 0} of all
variables appear in f = xa − xb, is called the support of f and is denoted by supp (f ).
i=1 aini for some non-negative
integers ai. The vector a is called a factorization of s and the set of all factorizations of
i=1 ai denote the total
order of a. Then the maximum integer n which is the total order of a vector in F (s) is
called the order of s and is denoted by ordS(s). A vector a ∈ F (s) with |a| = ordS(s),
i=1 aini is called a maximal expression

By deﬁnition, each element s ∈ S can be written as s =Pd
s is denoted by F (s), which is obviously a ﬁnite set. Let |a| =Pd
is called a maximal factorization of s and s =Pd
of s. For a vector a of non-negative integers, we set s(a) =Pd

i=1 aini.

Remark 2.2. Let s be an element of S and M = S \ {0} be the maximal ideal of S.
Then the order of s is the maximum integer n such that nM contains s. In other words,
s ∈ nM \ (n + 1)M if and only if n = ordS(s).

We use two partial orderings (cid:22) and (cid:22)M on S where, for all elements x and y in S,
x (cid:22) y if there is an element z ∈ S such that y = x + z and x (cid:22)M y if y = x + z with
ordS(y) = ordS(x) + ordS(z) for some z ∈ S. For a subset T ⊂ S, considering these
orderings, the maximal elements of T are denoted respectively by Max T and Max M T
and the minimal elements of T are respectively denoted by Min T and Min M T . It is
clear that Max T ⊆ Max M T and Min T ⊆ Min M T . The following easy fact will be
used frequently in our approach.

Lemma 2.3. Let s and y be elements in S. Then

(1) s (cid:22) y if and only if there exist factorizations a ∈ F (s) and b ∈ F (y) such that

the monomial xb is divided by xa.

(2) s (cid:22)M y if and only if there exist maximal factorizations a ∈ F (s) and b ∈ F (y)

such that the monomial xb is divided by xa.

The leading term of an element f ∈ P is the homogeneous summand of f with least
degree, which we denote it by f∗ and set ld(f ) for the degree of f∗. For an ideal I ⊂ P
we set I∗ ⊂ P be the graded ideal generated by all f∗ with f ∈ I. A set {f1, . . . , fr} of
elements of I is called a standard basis for I if I∗ is generated by {f1∗, . . . , fr ∗}.

In the sequel, we consider the coordinate ring G(S) of the tangent cone of R = k[S],
which is precisely the associated graded ring grm(R) of R with respect to the maximal
ideal m = (tn1, . . . , tnd). Note that

(1)

G(S) = grm(R) ∼= k[x1, . . . , xd]/I(n)∗

HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

Let A = k[[x1, . . . , xd]] be the formal power series ring and k[[S]] = k[[tn1, . . . , tnd]] be
the local ring associated to S. In other words k[[S]] = k[[x1, . . . , xd]]/J(n), where J(n)
is the kernel of the canonical homomorphism ψ : A −→ k[[t]] deﬁned by ψ(xi) = tni.
Note that the one dimensional integral domain k[[S]] is indeed the m-adic completion
of k[S]. The smallest element of N(S), e := n1/g, is equal to the multiplicity of
k[[N(S)]] ∼= k[[S]].
Indeed te generates a minimal reduction of the maximal ideal of
k[[N(S)]]. The element e is called the multiplicity of S and is denoted by m(S).

For an element f ∈ k[S] with m-adic order d, the residue class of f in md/md+1 is
called the initial form of f and is denoted by f ∗. Note that (ts)∗(ts′)∗ = 0 for two
elements s, s′ ∈ S, if and only if ordS(s + s′) > ordS(s) + ordS(s′). Hence if we set

T (S) := {s ∈ S; ∃ c > 0 with ord(s + cn1) > ord(s) + c},

then T (S) is precisely the set of elements of s ∈ S such that (ts)∗ annihilates some
power of tn1. These elements are called torsion elements of S. In the case that S is a
numerical semigroup, it is known that G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if T (S) = ∅,
which is proved for the ﬁrst time by A. García in [7, Theorem 7, Remark 8], see also [4,
Remark 2.11] for a diﬀerent proof. Now, by the isomorphism in Remark 2.1, we have
the following statement.

Proposition 2.4. G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if T (S) = ∅.

Let < be a monomial order on P and let f = Pn

i=1 rixai be a non-zero polynomial
with ri ∈ k. The leading monomial of f with respect to <, denoted by lm<(f ), is
the biggest monomial with respect to < among the monomials {xa1, . . . , xan}. A set
of polynomials G = {f1, . . . , fn} of an ideal I is called a Gröbner basis of I with
respect to <, if {lm<(f1), . . . , lm<(fn)} is the set of generators for the monomial ideal
lm<(I) = (lm<(f ) | f ∈ I). Since the monomial ideal lm<(I) has a unique minimal
set of monomial generators, the set of leading monomials of elements of any minimal
Gröbner basis for I, is a unique set. A Gröbner basis G is called reduced if the coeﬃcient
of lm<(fi) in fi is one for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and for i 6= j, none of the monomials of
supp (fj) is divided by lm<(fi). Any Gröbner basis of I is a generating set for I, a
reduced Gröbner basis exists and it is uniquely determined (cf. [12, Theorem 2.2.7]).

Remark 2.5. Let G = {f1, . . . , fr} be the reduced Gröbner basis of I. For each f ∈ I,
lm<(f ) is divided by lm<(fi) for some i = 1, . . . r. Therefore lm<(fi) does not divide
lm<(fj) for all j 6= i.

Remark 2.6. Since I(n) is a binomial ideal, the reduced Gröbner basis of I consists of
binomials by [12, Proposition 2.3.7].

We consider the negative degree reverse lexicographical ordering with x2 > · · · >

xd > x1, i.e. xb <ds xa precisely when one of the following statements holds:

• |b| > |a|; or
• |b| = |a| , b1 > a1; or
• |b| = |a| , b1 = a1, bd = ad, . . . , bi+1 = ai+1, bi > ai for some 2 ≤ i ≤ d.

6

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

Remark 2.7. Let f = Pn

i=1 rixai be a homogeneous polynomial, where ri ∈ k. Let
xa1 = lm<ds(f ) and x1 ∈ supp (xa1). Since xai <ds xa1 and |ai| = |a1|, we have
x1 ∈ supp (xai) for all i = 2, . . . , d. In particular x1 divides f .

Proposition 2.8 (cf. [1, Lemma 2.7]). Let G = {f1, . . . , fs} be a Gröbner basis of I(n)
with respect to <ds. Then G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if x1 does not divide
lm<ds(fi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ d.

Corollary 2.9. Let G be a Gröbner basis of I(n) with respect to <ds. Then x1 does not
divide lm<ds(f ) for all f ∈ G, if and only if x1 does not divide the leading monomials
of elements of any minimal Gröbner basis of I(n) with respect to <ds.

3. Semigroups with homogeneous Apéry sets

For an element s ∈ S, the Apéry set of S with respect to s is deﬁned as

AP(S, s) = {x ∈ S | x − s /∈ S}.

Let g := gcd(n1, . . . , nd) and N(S) = hn1/g, . . . , nd/gi be the numerical semigroup
assigned to S. Then for any positive integer s, we have s ∈ N(S) if and only if gs ∈ S.
Hence

AP(S, s) = {gx | x ∈ AP(N(S), s/g)}.

The Apéry set AP(N(S), t), for t ∈ N(S), is indeed the set of the smallest elements in
N(S) in each congruence class modulo t and has t elements.

Given 0 6= s ∈ S, the set of lengths of s in S is deﬁned as

L(s) = {

dXi=1

ri | s =

dXi=1

rini, ri ≥ 0}.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A subset T ⊂ S is called homogeneous if either it is empty or L(s)
is singleton for all 0 6= s ∈ T . In other words, all expressions of elements in T are
maximal. The numerical semigroup S is called homogeneous, when the Apéry set
AP(S, n1) is homogeneous.

Example 3.2. Let d = 2. Then AP(S, n1) = {0, n2, . . . , (n1 − 1)n2} is clearly homo-
geneous.

Example 3.3. A numerical semigroup is called of (almost) maximal embedding di-
mension if its multiplicity is equal to the embedding dimension (minus one). As in this
case, the Apéry set is precisely the minimal set of generators (and one more element
of order two), S is homogeneous.

Example 3.4. Let b > a > 3 be coprime integers. The semigroup Ha,b = ha, b, ab−a−bi
is called Frobenius semigroup (c.f.[14]), since it is obtained from the semigroup ha, bi
by adding its Frobenius number. Note that AP(Ha,b, a) = {0, b, . . . , (a − 2)b, ab − a − b}
and so it is homogeneous.

Note also that (ab − a − b) + a = (a − 1)b has order a − 1 > 2 and so G(Ha,b) is not

Cohen-Macaulay. Indeed T (Ha,b) = {ab − a − b}.

HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

Example 3.5. Recall that IS is called generic if it is generated by binomials with full
support i.e. all variables belong to the support of these binomials (cf. [21]). Let E be
the generic minimal set of generators of IS and let s ∈ AP(S, ni) with two expressions
j=2 bjnj. Then xa − xb ∈ IS should be generated by elements of
E. But all elements in E have xi in their support, which is not possible. Hence the
elements of AP(S, ni) have unique expressions, in particular AP(S, ni) is homogeneous.

j=2 ajnj = Pd

s = Pd

Example 3.6. Let S be the numerical semigroup minimally generated by the gener-
alized arithmetic sequence n0, ni = hn0 + it where t and h are positive integers and
i = 1, . . . , d. Since the generators are relatively prime, gcd(n0, t) = 1. We know from
[28] or [20, Proposition 2.2] that

AP(S, n0) = {hn0⌈

r
d

⌉ + tr ; 0 ≤ r < n0}.

Note that for an element a = lhn0 + tr of S with l ≥ 1, if r ≥ n0, then r = qn0 + r1
for some positive integer q and 0 ≤ r1 < n0. Now, a = w + (l − 1)hn0 + qtn0 where
w = hn0 + tr1 ∈ S and so a /∈ AP(S, n0).

Let s ∈ AP(S, n0), with two expressions of length l and l′. Then

s = lhn0 + tr = l′hn0 + tr′.

Since gcd(n0, t) = 1, we have lh = l′h + αt and r′ = r + αn0 for some integer α.
On the other hand r, r′ < n0, since s belongs to s ∈ AP(S, n0). Hence α = 0 and
consequently l = l′. Therefore AP(S, n0) is a homogeneous set.
Implicitly we have
ordS(hn0⌈ r

d⌉, for all 0 ≤ r < n0.

d⌉ + tr) = ⌈ r

Lemma 3.7. Let c be a factorization of an element s of S. Then there exists a minimal
set of generators E of IS such that each binomial xa − xb ∈ E with s(a) /∈ AP(S, s),
has one term divided by xc.

Proof. Let E1 be a ﬁnite set of generators for IS. If g = xa − xb ∈ E1 with z = s(a) /∈

AP(S, s), then z =Pd

i=1 dini, where di ≥ ci. Now

E2 = (E1 \ {g}) ∪ {xa − xd, xb − xd}

is again a ﬁnite set of generators for IS. Continuing in this way, we get a generating
set with the desired property and removing extra elements we have a minimal set of
generators.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.8. Let E be a subset of homogeneous binomials in IS and J be the ideal
generated by E. Then any binomial in J is homogeneous.

Proof. Let f = xa − xb be a binomial in J. If |a| 6= |b|, then xa is a homogeneous
component of f . Hence xa ∈ J ⊆ IS, a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.9. The following statements are equivalent for all s ∈ S.

(1) AP(S, s) is homogeneous.
(2) For any factorization c of s, there exists a minimal set of generators E for IS

such that one term of each non-homogeneous element of E is divided by xc.

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

Proof. (1)⇒(2): Let c be a factorization of s. By Lemma 3.7, there exists a minimal
set of generators E of IS such that each binomial xa − xb ∈ E with s(a) /∈ AP(S, s),
has one term divided by xc. Let f = xa − xb be a non-homogeneous binomial in E.
i=1 bini has two expressions with diﬀerent lengths. Hence

Then x = Pd

i=1 aini = Pd

x /∈ AP(S, s) and so xa or xb is divided by xc.

(2)⇒(1): Let

{f1, . . . , fn} = {f ∈ E | no term of f is divided by any factorization of s} .

Let z ∈ AP(S, s) with two expressions z = Pd

j=1 bjnj. Then xa − xb ∈
(f1, . . . , fn). Since all fj are homogeneous by the hypothesis, we get |a| = |b|, from
Lemma 3.8.
(cid:3)

j=1 ajnj = Pd

Corollary 3.10. The following statements are equivalent for i = 1, . . . , d.

(1) AP(S, ni) is homogeneous.
(2) There exists a minimal set of generators E for IS such that xi belongs to the

support of all non-homogeneous elements of E.

Consider the natural map

π : P = k[x1, . . . , xd] −→ ¯P := k[x2, . . . , xd],

where π(x1) = 0 and π(xi) = xi for i = 2, . . . , d. Then
¯P /π(IS) ∼= P/(IS, x1).

For a polynomial f ∈ P , we set ¯f := π(f ) and for a vector of non-negative integers

a = (a1, . . . , ad), we set

¯a =(cid:26) a

(a1 − 1, a2, . . . , ad)

if a1 = 0
if a1 > 0.

Remark 3.11. Let E be a minimal set of generators for IS and xa − xb ∈ E. Note that
aibi = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , d, since IS is prime and E is a minimal set of generators. If
b1 6= 0, then we replace xa − xb by xa − x1xc and xb − x1xc, where c is a maximal
expression in F (s(¯b)). Finally, we will have a set of minimal generators with the
property that, for any xa − xb ∈ E with b1 6= 0, we have ¯b is a maximal expression.

Next theorem is one of the main results in the paper.

Theorem 3.12. The following statements are equivalent.

(1) S is homogeneous and G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay.
(2) For all xa − xb ∈ IS with |a| > |b|, we have s(a) /∈ AP(S, n1). Moreover, if

a1 + b1 6= 0 and ¯b is a maximal factorization, then a1 ≥ b1.

(3) There exists a minimal set of binomial generators E for IS such that for all

xa − xb ∈ E with |a| > |b|, we have a1 6= 0.

(4) There exists a minimal set of binomial generators E for IS which is a standard

basis and for all xa − xb ∈ E with |a| > |b|, we have a1 6= 0.

(5) There exists a minimal Gröbner basis G for IS with respect to <ds, such that x1
belongs to the support of all non-homogeneous elements of G and x1 does not
divide lm<ds(f ), for all f ∈ G.

Proof. (1)⇒(2): The ﬁrst statement follows by Deﬁnition 3.1. For the second part, let
i=1 aini.
i=1 ai > 1 + ordS(s), which implies that s is a torsion element

¯bi. If a1 < b1, then ¯b1 = b1 − 1 and s + n1 =Pd

i=1

and this contradicts Proposition 2.4.

s := s(¯b). Then ordS(s) =Pd
Hence ordS(s + n1) ≥Pd
|b| and a1 = 0. Then s = Pd
Therefore s = Pd

i=1 aini = Pd
i=1 cini, where c1 > 0 and Pd

(2)⇒(3): Let E1 be a ﬁnite set of generators for IS. Let g = xa − xb ∈ E1 with |a| >
i=1 bini /∈ AP(S, n1) by the statement (2).
i=2 cini is a maximal expression. Now,
E2 = (E1 \ {g}) ∪ {xa − xc, xb − xc} is again a ﬁnite set of generators for IS. Note
also that c1 > a1 and c1 > b1 by the statement of (2). Continuing in this way, we
get a generating set with the desired property and removing extra elements we have a
minimal set of generators.

(3)⇒(4): We use the idea in the proof of [14, Theorem 1.4]. Let

E = {f1, . . . , ft, g1, . . . , gr},

where f1, . . . , ft are homogeneous binomials and g1, . . . , gr are non-homogeneous. Let
gi = xai − xbi with |ai| > |bi|. Then x1 divides xai and so π(gi) = xbi. Hence π(IS)
is generated by B = { ¯f1, . . . , ¯ft, xb1, . . . , xbr}. Note that ¯fi is either equal to fi which
is homogeneous, or it is a monomial. Therefore B is a homogeneous set of generators
for π(IS). In particular B is a standard basis of π(IS). Now, using [14, Lemma 1.2] we
get that E is a standard basis of IS (see the proof of [14, Theorem 1.4]).

(4)⇒(5): Let G = {g1 = xc1 − xd1, . . . , gs = xcs − xds} be the reduced Gröbner
basis with lm<ds(gi) = xci and E = {f1 = xa1 − xb1, . . . , fr = xar − xbr }.
If gi is
non-homogeneous, then |ci| < |di| and so gi∗ = xci. Since E is a standard basis,
fj ∗ divides xci for some j. Therefore fj is non-homogeneous, say |bj| < |aj|. Then
fj ∗ = xbj = lm<dc(fj) divides lm<ds(gi), which implies that xbj = lm<ds(gi) = xci by
Remark 2.5. Note that x1 is not in the support of homogeneous elements of G from
Remark 2.7. Now replacing gi with fj, we get the desired Gröbner basis.

(5)⇒(1): From Corollary 3.10 it follows that S is homogeneous and Proposition 2.8
(cid:3)

implies the Cohen-Macaulayness of G(S).

The following example illustrates the fact that even if S is homogeneous and G(S) is
Cohen-Macaulay, not any minimal generating set for IS satisﬁes the properties of the
theorem.

Example 3.13. Let S = h8, 10, 12, 25i. Then AP(S, 8) = {25, 10, 35, 12, 37, 22, 47} and
G1 = {x3
2} is a minimal generating set (the reduced Gröbner
basis) for IS. We can easily see that AP(S, 8) is a homogeneous set, while x5
4 is
a non-homogeneous element without x1 in its support. Note that 2 × 25 = 5 × 10 =
8 + 3 × 10 + 12. Hence replacing x5

By a general result due to Robbiano (see [23], [13]), Betti numbers of the associated
graded ring G(S) are above bounds for Betti numbers of the semigroup ring R i.e.
βi(R) ≤ βi(G(S)) for all i ≥ 1.

Deﬁnition 3.14. The semigroup S is called of homogeneous type if βi(R) = βi(G(S))
for all i ≥ 1.

Remark 3.15. If S is of homogeneous type, then depth (G(S)) = depth (S) = 1 and so
G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay.

Remark 3.16. If G(S) is complete intersection, then β1(S) = β1(G(S)) = d − 1. Hence
the free resolutions of S and G(S) coincide with the Koszul complexes with respect to
d − 1 elements and so S is of homogeneous type.

The following result is inspired by the ideas given in the proof of [14, Theorem 1.4].

Theorem 3.17. Let S be a homogeneous numerical semigroup with Cohen-Macaulay
tangent cone. Then S is of homogeneous type.

Proof. Let E = {f1, . . . , ft, g1, . . . , gr} be the minimal set of generators of IS which
exists by Theorem 3.12(4) and it is also a standard basis. Let f1, . . . , ft be homogeneous
binomials and g1, . . . , gr be non-homogeneous. Then the term of gi which is not the
leading term is divided by x1, for i = 1, . . . , r. Hence π(IS) is a homogeneous ideal and
so

βi( ¯P /π(IS)) = βi(gr¯n( ¯P /π(IS)),

where ¯n = π(n). Note that G(S) is indeed the completion of grn(P/IS) with respect to
the m-adic topology. As x1 is a non-zero-divisor on G(S), it is also a regular element
of grn(P/IS) and P/IS as well. Hence

gr¯n( ¯P /π(IS)) ∼= grn(P/IS)/x1 grn(P/IS),

by [11, Lemma, P. 185]. Now, the result follows from the fact that Betti numbers are
preserved under dividing by regular elements.
(cid:3)

It is proved in [14, Proposition 2.5] that a numerical semigroup generated by an
arithmetic sequence is of homogeneous type. For some classes of semigroups generated
by generalized arithmetic sequences, it is shown in [30, Corollary 4.12], that they are
of homogeneous type. Now, we have:

Corollary 3.18. Let S be a numerical semigroup generated by a generalized arithmetic
sequence. Then S is of homogeneous type.

Proof. By [30, Corollary 3.2], G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay. Now, the result follows by
Remark 3.6 and Theorem 3.17.
(cid:3)

The following example shows that the converse of Theorem 3.17, does not hold even

in embedding dimension three.

Example 3.19. Let S := h15, 21, 28i. Then I(S) = (x4
2) is minimally
generated by a standard basis of two elements. Hence G(S) is complete intersection
and so S is of homogeneous type (cf. Remark 3.16), but it is not homogeneous, since
3 × 28 = 4 × 21 = 84 ∈ AP(S, 15).

4. Small embedding dimensions

We ﬁrst recall the following deﬁnition: a binomial xci

j ∈ IS is called critical

i −Qj6=i xuij

with respect to xi if ci is the smallest integer such that cini ∈ hn1, . . . , bni, . . . , ndi. The

critical ideal of S, denoted by CS, is the ideal of k[x1, . . . , xd] generated by all critical
binomials of IS (cf. [17]).

Recall that a numerical semigroup with Frobenius number F (S), is called irreducible,
if it cannot be written as the intersection of two numerical semigroups properly con-
taining it. Let S be an irreducible numerical semigroup. Then S is called symmetric if
F (S) is odd and it is called pseudo symmetric if F (S) is even (cf. [8]).

The following classical result by J. Herzog describes the minimal systems of genera-

tors of IS for numerical semigrous S with embedding dimension three:

Theorem 4.1 ([10, Section 3]). Let S be a numerical semigroup of embedding dimen-
sion three. Then the following statements hold for some non-negative integers cij,
1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3.

(1) If S is symmetric, then after a permutation (i, j, k) of (1, 2, 3), we have

IS = (xci

i − xcj

j , xck

k − xcki

i xckj

j ).

(2) If S is not symmetric, then

IS = (xc1

1 xc32

2 ),

where ci = cji + cki for all permutation (i, j, k) of (1, 2, 3) and cij > 0 for all
1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ 3.

Theorem 4.2. Let S be a numerical semigroup of embedding dimension three.

(1) Let S be symmetric and (i, j, k) be the permutation of (1, 2, 3) such that the
statement (1) of Theorem 4.1 holds. Then AP(S, ni) and AP(S, nj) are homo-
geneous sets, and AP(S, nk) is not homogeneous.

(2) If S is not symmetric, then AP(S, ni) is homogeneous for all i = 1, 2, 3.

Proof. (1): From Theorem 4.1, we have IS = (xci
j ). As xi, xj belong
to the support of all generators of IS, AP(S, ni) and AP(S, nj) are homogeneous by
Corollary 3.10. Note that cini = cjnj. Hence xci
is not a homogeneous binomial.
If AP(S, nk) is homogeneous, then cini = cjnj is not in AP(S, nk). Therefore

i − xcj

k − xcki

i − xcj

cini = cjnj = rini + rjnj + rknk,

for some non-negative integers ri, rj, rk. According to the deﬁnition of ci and cj, we get
ri = rj = 0 and so rknk ∈ hni, nji. Let rk = ck + sk. Then

cini = cjnj = rknk = ckini + ckjnj + sknk,

12

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

which implies that cki = ckj = 0, a contradiction.

(2): By Theorem 4.1, xi, xj, xk belong to the support of all generators of IS and the
(cid:3)

result follows from Examples 3.5.

Remark 4.3. By (2) in the above theorem, we have that if S is not symmetric, S is
always homogeneous and so S is of homogeneous type if and only if G(S) is Cohen-
Macaulay. For instance, this is the case for S = h3, 5, 7i, see [24, Table 3.4].

Remark 4.4. In the symmetric case, S is not necessarily homogeneous neither of ho-
mogeneous type. For instance, this is what happens for S = h7, 8, 20i, see [24, Table
3.4].

We have seen two diﬀerent classes of numerical semigroups of homogeneous type:
homogeneous numerical semigroups with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones (cf. Theo-
rem 3.17) and numerical semigroups with complete intersection tangent cones (cf. Re-
mark 4.7). Our next result shows that in embedding dimension three, these two (dif-
ferent) classes determine all numerical semigroups of homogeneous type.

Theorem 4.5. Let S be a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension three. Then
the following statements are equivalent.

(1) S is of homogeneous type.
(2) β1(S) = β1(G(S)).
(3) G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay, and either S is homogeneous or (IS)∗ is generated by

pure powers of x2 and x3.

(4) Either S is homogeneous with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cone, or G(S) is com-

plete intersection.

Proof. (1)⇒(2) is clear.

(2)⇒(3): By Theorem 4.1, β1(S) ≤ 3. Therefore β1(G(S)) ≤ 3 and so G(S) is

Cohen-Macaulay from [24, Proposition 3.3].

Assume that S is not homogeneous. Hence S is symmetric by Theorem 4.2 and k = 1

in the statements of Theorem 4.1. Therefore

HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

13

Now, we look at numerical semigroups S with embedding dimension four. We start
by observing that, as in the case of embedding dimension 3, S is not necessarily homo-
geneous neither of homogeneous type. The following example is taken from [5, Remark
3.10]: let S = h16, 18, 21, 27i. Then, S is a complete intersection and G(S) is Goren-
stein but G(S) is not a complete intersection, hence the minimal number of generators
of the corresponding deﬁning ideals are diﬀerent and so S is not of homogeneous type.
Since G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay, S cannot be homogeneous neither. In fact, 81 ∈ AP(S)
and 81 = 3 × 27 = 3 × 18 + 27 are two expressions with diﬀerent size.

Let S with embedding dimension four. By a result of A. Katsabekis and I. Ojeda,
one can ﬁnd a minimal system of generators of IS with the following special property:

Proposition 4.6 ([17, Proposition 3.9]). Let S be a numerical semigroup of embedding
dimension four. Then there exists a minimal system of generators E = E1 ∪ E2 of IS,
where E1 is minimal set of generators of CS and E2 is a set of binomials with full
support.

Theorem 4.7. Let S be a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension four. Then
the following statements are equivalent for any i = 1, . . . , 4.

(1) AP(S, ni) is homogeneous.
(2) {cjnj | j 6= i} ∩ AP(S, ni) is a homogeneous set.

Proof. (1)⇒(2): It is clear.

(2)⇒(1): From Corollary 3.10, we only need to ﬁnd a set of generators for IS such
that all of its non-homogeneous elements have xi in their support. Let E be the minimal
set of generators which exists by Proposition 4.6. We only need to check the property
for the elements in E1. Let fj := xcj
j − xbj be a non-homogeneous element for some
j 6= i. Then cjnj /∈ AP(S, ni) and so cj = ni + s for some s ∈ S. Now, we can replace
fj with two binomials xcj
(cid:3)

j − xixa and xixa − xb, where a is a factorization of s.

Corollary 4.8. Let S be a numerical semigroup with embedding dimension four. Then
The following statements are equivalent.

(1) S is homogeneous.
(2) {c2n2, c3n3, c4n4} ∩ AP(S, n1) is a homogeneous set.
(3) c2n2 and c4n4 are not in AP(S, n1) and, if c3n3 ∈ AP(S, n1), then {c3n3} is

homogeneous.

Proof. (1)⇒(2): It is clear since AP(S, n1) is homogeneous.

(2)⇒(3): If c2n2 ∈ AP(S, n1), then c2n2 ∈ hn3, n4i. Therefore c2n2 = r3n3 + r4n4
for some non-negative integers r3, r4. Since n2 < n3, n4, we have c2 > r3 + r4, a
contradiction. As n4 > n2, n3, a similar argument shows that c4n4 is not in AP(S, n1).

(3) ⇒(1): It follows from Theorem 4.7.

(cid:3)

The following well known result by H. Bresisnky provides the systems of generators
for the deﬁning ideals of non-complete intersection symmetric numerical semigroups
with embedding dimension four:

14

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

Theorem 4.9 (Bresinsky’s Theorem [3, Theorem 3]). Let S be a numerical semigroup
of embedding dimension four. Then S is symmetric and non-complete intersection if
and only if, after permuting variables, if necessary, IS is generated by the set

G = {f1 = xc1
f4 = xc4

1 − xc13

where 0 < cij < cj.

Remark 4.10. Let S be a symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four.
If S is not complete intersection, then the set G given in Theorem 4.9, is the unique
minimal system of generators for IS (cf. [17, Corollary 3.15]).

Proposition 4.11. Let S be a symmetric and non-complete intersection numerical
semigroup with embedding dimension four. Using the notation of Theorem 4.9, the
following statements hold.

(1) AP(S, n1) is homogeneous if and only if f4 is a homogeneous polynomial.
(2) For each i = 2, 3, 4, AP(S, ni) is homogeneous if and only if fi−1 is a homoge-

neous polynomial.

Proof. As G is the unique minimal system of generators by Remark 4.10, the critical
elements cini belong to AP(S, nj) for xj /∈ supp (fi). Now, the result follows from
Theorem 4.7.
(cid:3)

Example 4.12. Let S = h8, 13, 15, 17i. Then, IS = (f1 = x4
2−x1x3, f3 =
4 − x1x2
x2
1x4) (with order 8, 13, 17, 15). Since f4 is
homogeneous, by the above proposition S is homogeneous. We also have that S is not
Cohen-Macaulay because 15 + 17 = 4 × 8, hence S is not of homogeneous type.

The following two families extracted form [8] can be used to produce symmetric
numerical semigroups S with embedding dimension four and given multiplicity m,
which are not of homogeneous type neither homogeneous:

Lemma 4.13. Let q be a positive integer.

(1) If m = 2q + 4, then the numerical semigroup generated by

{n1 := m, n2 := m + 1, n3 := (q + 1)m − 2, n4 := (q + 1)m − 1},

is a symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four and Frobenius
number F (S) = 2qm + 2q + 1.

(2) If m = 2q + 5. Then the numerical semigroup generated by

{n1 := m, n2 := m + 1, n3 := (q + 1)m + q + 2, n4 := (q + 1)m + q + 3},

is a symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four, with Frobe-
nius number F (S) = 2(q + 1)m − 1.

Proof. (1) follows from [8, Lemma 4.22] and (2) is the subject of [8, Lemma 4.23]. (cid:3)

HOMOGENEOUS NUMERICAL SEMIGROUPS

Proposition 4.14. Let S be a symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension
four, with one of structures of Lemma 4.13. Then S is not of homogeneous type and
AP(S, ni) is not homogeneous for all i = 1, . . . , 4.

Proof. In the case m = 2q + 4, we show that IS is generated by
3 − x1x2q

2 − x3x4, x2

1 x3, x2q+1

G1 := {xq+2

4 − xq+1

1 − x2x4, x2
First, we check that G1 ⊆ IS:

2 , x1x4 − x2x3}.

(q + 2)n1 = (q + 2)m = (q + 1)m + m + 1 − 1 = n2 + n4,
(2q + 1)n2 = (2q + 1)(m + 1) = (2q + 1)m + 2q + 1 = 2qm + m + 2q + 1

= 2qm + m + m − 3 = 2(q + 1)m − 3 = n3 + n4,

2n3 = 2(q + 1)m − 4 = 2qm + 2m − 4 = 2qm + m + 2q = m + 2q(m + 1)

= n1 + 2qn2,

2n4 = 2(q + 1)m − 2 = (q + 1)m + (q + 1)m − 2 = (q + 1)n1 + n3,

n1 + n4 = m + (q + 1)m + q + 3 = (q + 1)m + q + 2 + (m + 1) = n3 + n2.

Hence c3 = c4 = 2. From the proof of [8, Lemma 4.22], n3 + n4 = (2q + 1)n2 ∈
AP(S, n1). Therefore c2 = 2q + 1. Note that n2 + n4 − n3 = m + 2 /∈ S. So that
(q + 1)n1 = n2 + n4 has unique expression, in particular c1 = q + 1. As the last
relation x1x4 − x2x3 is not generated by the others, IS has more than 4 generators and
so S is not complete intersection. Now, Theorem 4.9 implies that G1 is the minimal
generating set of IS. Note that none of the critical binomials in G1 are homogeneous, so
it follows that AP(S, ni) is not homogeneous for all i = 1, . . . , 4, by Theorem 4.7. Now,
f := x2q+2
1 −x2x4) ∈ IS, where 2q+2 ≥ q+3. Hence
f∗ = x3xq+2
is not generated by the elements of (G1)∗ = {x2x4, x2
3, x1x4−x2x3}.
Therefore G1 is not a standard basis and so β1(G(S)) > β1(S).

In the second case m = 2q + 5, we show with a similar argument that

3 − xq+1

2 x4, x2

is the minimal set of generators of IS. Since all critical binomials in G2 are non-
homogeneous, AP(S, ni) is not homogeneous for all i = 1, . . . , 4, by Theorem 4.7.
Finally, the relation xq+2
2 − x1x3 implies that n3 is a torsion element and G(S) is not
Cohen-Macaulay. In particular, S is not of homogeneous type.
(cid:3)

For the pseudo symmetric case, we get the families of generators of the deﬁning ideal

IS from the following result by J. Komeda:

Theorem 4.15 (Komeda’s Theorem [18, Theorem 6.4]). Let S be a pseudo symmet-
ric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four. After permuting variables, if
necessary, the ideal IS is generated by

Proposition 4.16. Let S be a pseudo symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding
dimension four. Using the notation of Komeda’s Theorem, we have

(1) AP(S, n1) is a homogeneous set.
(2) For i = 2, 3, 4, AP(S, ni) is homogeneous if and only if {ci−1ni−1} ∩ AP(S, ni)

is a homogeneous set.

(3) For each i = 2, 3, 4, if fi−1 is a homogeneous polynomial, then AP(S, ni) is a
homogeneous set. The converse holds if G is the only set of minimal generators
for IS.

Proof. (1): Since x1 ∈ supp (fi) for i = 2, 3, 4, it follows by Corollary 3.10.

(2): Since xi ∈ supp (fj) for i = 2, 3, 4, j 6= i − 1, we have cini /∈ AP(S, nj) for

i = 2, 3, 4, j 6= i − 1. Now the result follows by Corollary 4.8.

(3): If fi−1 is homogeneous, then AP(S, ni) is homogeneous by the statement (2). If
fj is uniquely determined for j = 1, . . . , 4, then ci−1ni−1 ∈ AP(S, ni) for i = 2, 3, 4 and
the result follows from the statement (2).
(cid:3)

Similarly to the symmetric case, we have the following families of pseudo symmetric

numerical semigroups with embedding dimension four and given multiplicity m:

Lemma 4.17. Let q be a positive integer.

(1) If m = 2q + 5, then the numerical semigroup generated by

{n1 := m, n2 := m + 1, n3 := (q + 1)m + q + 2, n4 := (q + 1)m + m − 1},

is a pseudo symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four and
Frobenius number F (S) = 2(q + 1)m − 2.

(2) If m = 2q + 4. Then the numerical semigroup generated by

{n1 := m, n2 := m + 1, n3 := qm + 2q + 3, n4 := (q + 1)m + q + 2},

is a pseudo symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding dimension four, with
Frobenius number F (S) = 2qm + 2q + 2.

Proof. (1) follows from [8, Lemma 4.29] and (2) is the subject of [8, Lemma 4.30]. (cid:3)

Example 4.18. Let S = h7, 8, 17, 20i. It is pseudo symmetric from Lemma 4.17(1),
considering q = 1. The deﬁning ideal IS is generated by {x4
3 −
x2
1x4, x2
2−x3x4}, so that S is homogeneous by Proposition 4.16. Note that
G(S) is not Cohen-Macaulay because of 7 + 17 = 3 × 8 hence S is not of homogeneous
type too.

x2x4, x2
4}. So this ordering 6, 7, 11, 15 is not the permutation that
gives the generators in Theorem 4.16, but S is homogeneous by Corollary 3.10. As
6 + 15 = 3 × 7, G(S) is not Cohen-Macaulay and so S is not of homogeneous type.

Example 4.20. Let S = h8, 9, 23, 28i. S is pseudo symmetric from Lemma 4.17(2),
considering q = 2. The deﬁning ideal IS is generated by {f1 = x4

x1x4, f3 = x2
2 − x3x4}. The non-homogeneous
binomial f3 comes from the relation 2n3 = 2n2 + n4 = 46 ∈ AP(S, 8). Hence S is not
homogeneous. Note that G(S) is not Cohen-Macaulay because of relation f2 and so
S is not of homogeneous type. Now, considering the permutation 9, 23, 8, 28, we get
G = {x4

These examples can be extended in the following way:

Proposition 4.21. Let S be a pseudo symmetric numerical semigroup of embedding di-
mension four, with the structure of Lemma 4.17. If m = 2q +5, then S is homogeneous.
If m = 2q + 4 and q > 1, then S is not homogeneous and G(S) is not Cohen-Macaulay.

Proof. Let m = 2q + 5, then 2n3 = 2(q + 1)m + 2q + 4 > 2(q + 1)m + 2q + 3 =
2(q + 1)m − 2 + m = F (S) + m. Therefore 2n4 > n3 + n4 > 2n3 > F (S) + m and
so 2n4, n3 + n4, 2n3 are not in AP(S, m). This implies that {c3n3, c4n4} ∩ AP(S, m) is
empty or has elements of order one and so it is a homogeneous set. If c2n2 ∈ AP(S, m)
and c2n2 = r3n3 + r4n4, as n3 + n4 /∈ AP(S, m) we should have r3 = 0 or r4 = 0. Then
r3, r4 ≤ 1 which is not possible. Hence AP(S, m) is homogeneous by Corollary 4.8.

Now, let m = 2q + 4. Then 2n3 −n1 = 2(qm+ 2q + 3)−m = 2(qm+ 2q + 3)−2q −4 =
2qm + 2q + 2 = F (S) /∈ S. Hence 2n3 ∈ AP(S, n1). On the other hand, as in the proof
of [8, Lemma 4.30], the only elements of order two in AP (S, m) belong to {2n2, n2+n4}.
If 2n3 is homogeneous, then 2n3 = n2+n4. Hence 2qm+4q+6 = m+1+(q+1)m+q+2,
which implies that 2m = qm + 3q + 3, a contradiction since q > 1.

For the last statement, note that n4 + n1 = (q + 1)m + q + 2 + m = (q + 2)(m + 1) =
(cid:3)

(q + 2)n2 and so n4 is a torsion element of S.

In embedding dimension three, we have classiﬁed all numerical semigroups of ho-
mogeneous type in to numerical semigroups with complete intersection tangent cones
and the homogeneous ones with Cohen-Macaulay tangent cones (cf. Theorem 4.5).
On other hand, all four generated numerical semigroups of homogeneous type that we
have discussed in this section are homogeneous. So it is natural to look for a similar
classiﬁcation in larger embedding dimensions:

Question 4.22. Is there any numerical semigroup S with embedding dimension d > 3
such that S is of homogeneous type, but it is not homogeneous and its tangent cone is
not complete intersection?

In the following remark we discuss a class of rings that are of homogeneous type.
Concluding that numerical semigroups in this class are homogeneous, supports a neg-
ative answer to the above question.

Remark 4.23. An Artinian local ring (A, m) is stretched, in the sense of [27], if and only
if m2 is principal. From [26, Example 3.5], if A is stretched and its Cohen-Macaulay

18

type is equal to µ(m) − 1, where µ(m) is the embedding dimension of A, then A is of
homogeneous type.

Let S be a numerical semigroup such that G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay and let A =
k[[S]]/(x1). With similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 3.17, S is of homogeneous
type if and only if A is of homogeneous type.

w = ni1 + ni2. Let s = Pd

i=2 rini ∈ AP(S, n1) with ordS(s) = Pd

Now, if this is the case, then AP(S, n1) has only one element of order two, say
i=2 ri > 2. As any
subexpression of s is again in the Apéry set, any maximal subexpression of s with
In particular ni1 = ni2 and s = lni1, where l =
length 2 should be equal to w.
ordS(s). Therefore {w ∈ AP(S, n1); ordS(w) ≥ 2} has only one maximal element with
respect to (cid:22). On the other hand, the Cohen-Macaulay type of S which is exactly the
number of maximal elements of AP(S, n1), is equal to d − 1. Hence Max (cid:22) AP(S, n1) =
{lni1, n2, . . . , nd} \ {ni1}, where l is the maximal order of elements of the Apéry set. In
particular, nj + ni /∈ AP(S, n1) for all j ∈ {1, . . . , d} \ {i1} and 1 ≤ i ≤ d. Hence all
expressions of tni1 have the same order for all 1 ≤ t ≤ l, consequently S is homogeneous.
It is clear that all numerical semigroups of almost maximal embedding dimension
(cf. Example 3.3) fulﬁll the conditions above. Let S = h10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19i.
Then AP(S, 10) = {0, 11, 22, 33, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} has only one element of order two
and is not of almost maximal embedding dimension.

5. Gluing of homogeneous semigroups

Throughout this section S1 and S2 are two numerical semigroups generated by m1 <
· · · < md and n1 < · · · < nk, respectively. Let p ∈ S1 and q ∈ S2 be two positive
integers satisfying gcd(p, q) = 1 with p /∈ {m1, . . . , md} and q /∈ {n1, . . . , nk}. The
numerical semigroup

S =< qm1, . . . , qmd, pn1, . . . , pnk >

is called a gluing of S1 and S2 (cf.
S2 = N (cf. [2]).

[25]). An extension of S1, is a gluing S with

In the rest of this section, S will denote the above gluing of S1 and S2.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let S be a gluing of S1 and S2.

(1) S is called nice gluing, if q = an1 for some 1 < a ≤ ordS1(p) (cf. [1]).
(2) S is called speciﬁc gluing, if ordS2(q) + lq(S2) ≤ ordS1(p), where lq(S2) =

max{ordS2(s + q) − ordS2(q) − ordS2(s); s ∈ S2} (cf. [15]).

Remark 5.2. It is easy to see from the deﬁnition that the set

{qm1, . . . , qmd, pn1, . . . , pnk}

is a minimal system of generators of S and m(S) = min{qm1, pn1}. If S is a nice gluing
of S1 and S2, then qm1 = an1m1 ≤ ordS1(p)n1m1 ≤ pn1 and so m(S) = qm1. This is
also the case when S is a speciﬁc gluing, from [15, Corollary 3.14].

Remark 5.3. We consider IS1 as an ideal of k[x1, . . . , xd] and IS2 an ideal of k[y1, . . . , yk].
Then IS = IS1 + IS2 + hxp − yqi is an ideal of k[x1, . . . , xd, y1, . . . , yk], where p and q
are, respectively, some factorizations of p and q (cf. [25, Theorem 1.4]).

Proposition 5.4. The following statements hold for all s ∈ S1.
(1) AP(S, qs) = {qz1 + pz2 ; z1 ∈ AP(S1, s), z2 ∈ AP(S2, q)}.
(2) If qz1 + pz2 ∈ AP(S, qs), then z1 ∈ AP(S1, s).
(3) If p /∈ AP(S1, s), then for all z ∈ AP(S, qs) there exist unique z1 ∈ S1 and

z2 ∈ S2 such that z = qz1 + pz2.

(4) If qz1 + pz2 ∈ AP(S, qs) and p /∈ AP(S1, s), then z2 ∈ AP(S2, q).

Proof. The statements (1) and (2) are the subject of [15, Proposition 3.8]. For the
proof of (3), note that z = qz1 + pz2 for some z1 ∈ AP(S1, s) and z2 AP(S2, q), by (1).
1 + pz′
If there exist another z′
2 ∈ S2 with z = qz′
1 + αp for
some integer α, as gcd(p, q) = 1. On the other hand, z′
1 and z1 belong to AP(S1, s) by
(2). Hence α = 0 and so z1 = z′

2, then z1 = z′

1 ∈ S1 and z′

1 and so z′

2 = z2.

The statement (4) follows by (1) and (3).

(cid:3)

Corollary 5.5. If AP(S, qs) is homogeneous for some s ∈ S1, then AP(S1, s) is a
homogeneous set. Moreover, if p /∈ AP(S1, s), then AP(S2, q) is also homogeneous.

The following example shows that the gluing of two homogeneous numerical semi-

group is not necessarily homogeneous.

Example 5.6. Let S := h15, 21, 28i. Then S is an extension of S1 = h5, 7i with q = 3
and p = 28, but S is not homogeneous from Example 3.19.

The following result is the key for our study of the homogeneity of a gluing:

Theorem 5.7. Let S be a gluing of S1 and S2, s ∈ S and n = min{n ∈ N; np /∈
AP(S1, s)}. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(1) AP(S, qs) is homogeneous.
(2) AP(S1, s) and AP(S2, nq) are homogeneous, and if n > 1, then ordS1(p) =

ordS2(q).

Proof. (1)⇒(2): If AP(S, qs) is homogeneous, then AP(S1, s) is homogeneous by Corol-
lary 5.5. Let y ∈ AP(S2, nq) with two expressions with diﬀerent lengths. Then
py /∈ AP(S, qs) and so py = qz1 + pz2 such that z1 /∈ AP(S1, s) and z2 ∈ S2. As
gcd(p, q) = 1, we have z1 = αp and y = z2 + αq for some integer α ≥ 0. Note that
α ≥ n, since αp = z1 /∈ AP(S1, s). Hence y = z2 + αq /∈ AP(S2, nq), a contradiction.

Now, assume that ordS1(p) 6= ordS2(q). Then {qp} is not a homogeneous set of S
and so qp /∈ AP(S, qs). Let qp = qz1 + pz2 for some z1 /∈ AP(S1, s) and z2 ∈ S2,
which implies that z1 = ap and z2 = bq for some non-negative integers a and b. Hence
qp = (a + b)qp and so a + b = 1. Since z1 /∈ AP(S1, s), we get a = 1 and b = 0.
Therefore p = z1 is not in AP(S1, s) i.e. n = 1.

(2)⇒(1): Let p, q and a be factorizations of p, q and s, respectively and let E1 and
E2 be minimal generating sets for IS1 and IS2, respectively, as the ones in Proposi-
tion 3.9(2). Now, E = E1 ∪ E2 ∪ {xp − yq} is a generating set for IS by Remark 5.3.
Note that one term of each non-homogeneous binomial f ∈ E1 is divided by xa, and

20

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

any non-homogeneous binomial g = yc − yb ∈ E2 has one term divided ynq. Assume
that yc = ynqyd. Then h := xnpyd − yb ∈ IS and g is generated by h and xp − yq.
Therefore replacing g by h, we get again a generating set for IS. Continuing in this
way, we get a generating set for IS which satisﬁes the property of Proposition 3.9(2),
since np /∈ AP(S1, s). Note that, if xp − yq is non-homogeneous, then n = 1 which
means that p /∈ AP(S1, s).
(cid:3)

As a consequence we obtain the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for an extension

of a homogeneous numerical semigroup to be homogeneous:

Corollary 5.8. Let S1 be a homogeneous numerical semigroup and S2 = N. Then S
is homogeneous if and only if one of the following conditions hold.

(1) q = ordS1(p).
(2) p /∈ AP(S1, m1).

Corollary 5.9. Let S1 be a homogeneous numerical semigroup with Cohen-Macaulay
tangent cone and S2 = N. For each positive integer q, if p ∈ S1 \ AP(S1, m1) with
ordS1(p) ≥ q, then S is of homogeneous type.

Proof. Note that S is a speciﬁc extension of S1 and so G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay by
[15, Theorem 3.16]. On the other hand S is homogeneous by Corollary 5.8. Now,
Theorem 3.17 implies the result.
(cid:3)

Now we want to show how to construct systematically non homogeneous numerical

semigroups whose tangent cones are complete intersection.

Lemma 5.10. Let S = hqm1, . . . , qm, pn1, . . . , pnki be a nice gluing of S1 and S2. Let
G1 and G2 be Gröbner basis of IS1 and IS2 with respect to <ds, respectively. If G(S1)
and G(S2) are Cohen-Macaulay, then G1 ∪ G2 ∪ {xp − ya
1} is a Gröbner basis of IS,
for any factorization p of p. More over, if G1 and G2 are reduced Gröbner basis, then
there exists a factorization p of p, such that G is the reduced Gröbner basis.

Proof. B = {f1, . . . , fr, g1, . . . , gs, h1, . . . , ht} be the reduced Gröbner basis of IS, where
supp (fi) ⊆ {x1, . . . , xd}, supp (gi) ⊆ {y1, . . . , yk}. From the proof of [1, Theorem 2.6],
G is a Gröbner basis of IS with respect to <ds. Since G1 and G2 are reduced and
B is unique, we have G1 = {f1, . . . , fr} and G2 = {g1, . . . , gs}. Hence t = 1 and
lm<ds(h1) = ya
1.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.11. Let S1 be a numerical semigroup of embedding dimension two and mul-
tiplicity m(S1) > 3. Then there exists an extension of S1 with complete intersection
tangent cone which is not homogeneous.

Proof. Let S1 = hm1, m2i. Then AP(S1, m1) = {m2, . . . , (m1 − 1)m2}. Let p = (m1 −
1)m2 and q = 2. Then ordS1 p = m1 − 1 > 2 = q. Hence S = hqm1, qm2, pi is not
homogeneous by Corollary 5.8. Note that G1 = {xm2
2 } is a Gröbner basis for IS1.
Therefore G = {xm2
2 , xp − ym1−1} is a Gröbner basis for IS by Lemma 5.10 and
so G(S) is complete intersection.

Proposition 5.12. Let d ≥ 3 be an integer. Then there exist inﬁnitely many numerical
semigroup with complete intersection tangent cones of embedding dimension d, which
are not homogeneous.

Proof. For d = 3, the result is clear by Lemma 5.11. We proceed by induction on
d. Let S1 = hm1 < · · · < md−1i be a numerical semigroup of embedding dimension
d − 1, with complete intersection tangent cone which is not homogeneous. Let q = 2
and p ∈ S1 such that ordS1(p) ≥ 2 and gcd(q, p) = 1. Then the extension S :=
hqm1, . . . , qd−1md−1, pi is a nice extension of S. Since S1 is not homogeneous, S is not
homogeneous by Theorem 5.7. On the other hand, if G := {f1, . . . , fd−2} is a Gröbner
basis with respect to <ds, for I(S1), then G ∪ {xp − yq} is a Gröbner basis with respect
to <ds, for I(S′) by Lemma 5.10. Therefore G(S′) is complete intersection.
(cid:3)

As a consequence we get:

Corollary 5.13. Let d ≥ 3. Then there exist inﬁnitely many numerical semigroups
with embedding dimension d, which are of homogeneous type but they are not homoge-
neous.

6. Shifted family of semigroups

Let n : n1 < · · · < nd be a sequence of positive integers. For any non-negative integer

j, we consider the shifted family

and the semigroup

n + j : n1 + j, . . . , nd + j.

S + j := hn1 + j, . . . , nd + ji,

that we call the j-th shifting of S.

Remark 6.1. If the semigroup S generated by n is a numerical semigroup, it may
happen that S + j is not anymore a numerical semigroup. For instance, let S = h4, 7i.
Then S + 2 = h6, 9i. Also, it may happen that n is a minimal system of generators of
S but the shifted family is not anymore a minimal system of generators of S + j. For
instance, S = h4, 10, 12i and S + 2 = h6, 12, 14i = h6, 14i.

Lemma 6.2. If S is the numerical semigroup minimally generated by n, then S + j is
minimally generated by n + j for all j > nd − 2n1.

i=1 si(ni + j) for some non-negative integers si. Let

Proof. Assume that nr + j = Pd
a =Pd

i=1 si. If a ≥ 2, then

nr + j ≥ a(n1 + j) ≥ 2n1 + 2j > nd + j.

Hence nr > nd, a contradiction.

(cid:3)

We will use the following notation in the sequel:

• mi := nd − ni for 1 ≤ i ≤ d;
• g := gcd(m1, . . . , md−1);
• T := h m1

where J(n) is the ideal generated by all homogeneous elements of IS. It is shown by Vu,
in [32, Corollary 3.6], that for any j > N, for inhomogeneous prime binomials xa − xb
of IS, x1 divides xa where |a| > |b|. Using this fact, Herzog-Stamate [14, Theorem 1.4]
show that S + j is of homogeneous type, in particular Cohen-Macaulay, for all j > N.
In the following result, we improve this bound N by L, which only depends on the
initial data of the family a, using ideas inspired by [32].

Theorem 6.3. Let j > L and s ∈ S + j. If a, a′ ∈ F (s) with |a| > |a′|, then there
exists b ∈ F (s) such that |b| = |a| and b1 6= 0.

Proof. Let l := |a| and l′ := |a′|. Then

Hence we have Pd

Let x := Pd

hm1, . . . , md−1i, which has maximum support between all factorizations of x with total
order l. We show arguing by contradiction that c1 6= 0. If c1 = 0, then x ≤ lm2 and so

Let F := {i, ci 6= 0} and y := x −Pi∈F mi. Then

y ≥ x − dm1 > nd + j − dm1 > gc,

x/m2 ≤ l.

the second inequality holds by (2) and the last one follows because nd + j > L >
gc + dm1. As y > gc, we may write y = tm1 + v for some integers t ≥ 0 and
gc ≤ v < gc + m1. Note that both y and m1 are divided by g and so g|v. Since v/g ≥ c,

i=1 wi + t + |F |). Now, z is a factorization of x with larger support than c, a
i=1 cini. Hence we
(cid:3)

can take b = c and the result follows.

Corollary 6.4. If j > L, then S + j is homogeneous and G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay.

Proof. It follows by Proposition 3.12(2).

Corollary 6.5. [14] If j > L, then S + j is of homogeneous type.

Proof. It follows by Corollary 6.4 and Proposition 6.3.

Deﬁnition 6.6. Given a sequence of positive integers s : s0 = 0 < s1 < · · · < sd−1,
d ≥ 2, we say that n is of shifting type s if si = nd − nd−i, for all 1 ≤ · · · ≤ d − 1. We
also say that the semigroup S = hn1, . . . , ndi is of shifting type s.

Remark 6.7. Note that nd−i = sd−1 − si + n1 for all i = 1, . . . , d, hence the sequence n
is uniquely determined by n1 and its shifting type.

Remark 6.8. The shifting type is invariant under shifting and two sequences of d positive
integers are shifted one form the other if and only if they have the same shifting type.

Note that sequence of integers

n : n1 = 1, n2 = sd−1 − sd−2 + 1, . . . , nd = sd−1 − s0 + 1 = sd−1 + 1

is the one with shifting type s and smallest possible n1.

Now, for a given sequence s, let:

• g := gcd(s1, . . . , sd−1);
• T := h s1

g , . . . , sd−1

g i;

• L := sd−1sd−2(cid:16) gc+dsd−1

s1

+ d(cid:17) − sd−1 − 1, where c is the conductor of T .

We may reformulate the above results in the following way:

Proposition 6.9. Given a sequence of positive integers s : s0 = 0 < s1 < · · · < sd−1,
for any e > L all the numerical semigroups S = hn1, . . . , ndi with n1 = e and shifting
type s are homogeneous and G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay.

24

RAHELEH JAFARI AND S. ZARZUELA ARMENGOU

By using the notation in [14], we deﬁne the width of a numerical semigroup S as the
diﬀerence between the largest and the smallest generator in a minimal set of generators
of S, and denote this number as wd(S). It is clear that for a given positive integer
w ≥ 2, there is only a ﬁnite number of possible sequences s for the shifting type of the
numerical semigroups whose width is bounded by w. So we ﬁnally conclude that:

Proposition 6.10. Let w ≥ 2. Then, there exists a positive integer W such that all
the numerical semigroups S with wd(S) ≤ w and muiltiplicity e ≥ W , are homogeneous
and G(S) is Cohen-Macaulay.

Example 6.11. Let a < b be positive integers. Then Sk = hk, k + a, k + bi is a
numerical semigroup with shifting type s1 = b − a, s2 = b, for any k > 0 and L =
b(b − a)( gc+3b

b−a + 3) − b − 1 = 3b(2b − a) − 1 + b(gc − 1).

Remark 6.12. For numerical semigroups Sk = hk, k + a, k + bi of embedding dimension
three, the given bound by Vu [32], is improved by Stamate in [31, Theorem 3.5] showing
that the Betti numbers of Sk are periodic in k, for k > ka,b = max{b( b−a
g }.
Moreover, Sk is of homogeneous type for k > ka,b. As the above example shows, in
embedding dimension three, ka,b is a better bound.
