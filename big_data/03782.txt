We consider 2+1 dimensional oﬀ-shell N = 1 pure supergravity that is constructed from graviton,
gravitino and auxiliary ﬁeld. We show that the R2 supersymmetric invariant and R2
µν supersym-
metric invariant are expressed as local supersymmetric exact terms up to mass terms for gravitino.
In both cases, the mass parameter is proportional to the oﬀ-shell supersymmetric cosmological
constant.

INTRODUCTION

Calculating quantum gravity partition function in a
certain reasonable way is one of the most important and
fundamental questions in theoretical physics. Even in
the conventional quantum ﬁeld theory with spin 0, 1/2,
1 ﬁelds, the exact computation is extremely diﬃcult in
many cases, and we are often tempted to use perturbative
analysis. However, if there are some supersymmetries,
one can utilize these symmetries to reduce the path in-
tegral to the ﬁnite dimensional matrix models [1, 2]. In
this procedure, the existence of supersymmetric “exact”
Lagrangian is extremely important because adding such
term into the path integral weight does not change the
ﬁnal result and the WKB computation turns out to be
exact by taking its coupling constant to be inﬁnite (or
zero).

By applying this technique to the gravity path integral,
we would like to make the gravity path integral well-
deﬁned. In [3], the authors considered such possibility in
terms of supersymmetric Chern-Simons formulation of
the three-dimensional gravity. In this notes, we discuss
another possibility:
localization computation with local
supersymmetry. We will focus on 2+1 dimensional N =
1 supergravity, and we start with reviewing some known
facts on the theory.

The ﬁrst one is the usual Einstein-Hilbert term. The sec-
ond one corresponds to the cosmological constant term.
Just by integrating out the auxiliary ﬁeld, it generates
the usual negative cosmological constant term, and the
resultant Lagrangian turns out to be so-called N = (1, 0)
AdS-supergravity. In addition to that, one can ﬁnd su-
persymmetric gravitational CS term, but we omit them
for simplicity. Other supersymmetric terms can be found
in [4] as follows.

III. SUSY EXACT TERMS

For the localization calculation, the most important
feature is the following point: To obtain the partition
function Z = limt→0 Z(t), we deﬁne Z(t) as

Z(t) = Z Deµ

aDψµDS eiS+itδV ,

(10)

and furthermore this Z(t) does not depend on the pa-
rameter t. Then we can take t → ∞ limit to conduct the
computation, and in this limit, all the contributions of
the path integral are localized on the ﬁeld conﬁgurations
which satisfy δV = 0 [17]. In quantum ﬁeld theory, this
technique achieved great successes [1, 2] and uncovered
structures of the interacting supersymmetric ﬁeld theo-
ries in various dimensions. The necessary ingredients for
this t-independence are 1: oﬀ-shell supersymmetry δ, 2:

supersymmetric invariant action S = R L and 3: super-

symmetric exact action δV where V is a certain func-
tional of the ﬁelds, which satisfy δ2V = 0. Naively, we
expect that its analog to the supergravity provides us an
unknown structures of quantum gravity. In this notes,
we try to do it.

δ(e[ ¯χδχ]) = (¯ǫǫ)LR2
µν +cosm
δ(e[¯λδλ]) = (¯ǫǫ)LR2+cosm

(13)

(14)

These relations show that above LR2
µν +cosm and LR2+cosm
are SUSY exact terms. Of course, the Lagrangians LR2
and LR2 preserves supersymmetry. However, in each case
(11) or (12), one has a mass term for the fermion, and
it is a typical supersymmetry breaking term, where the
supersymmetry breaking is given by the supersymmetric
cosmological constant term LC .

µν

One might wonder why these SUSY exact actions are
not SUSY invariant. The reason is as follows. In rigid
limit, we have δ2 = 0 in ﬁeld theoretical sense, and one
can show SUSY invariance just by acting additional δ
to (13) or (14). However if we do not take a rigid limit
(ψµ = 0), then we have δ2 6= 0. As a result, (13) and
(14) are not SUSY invariant, even though they are SUSY
exact.

IV. NAIVE ATTEMPT TOWARD GRAVITY

LOCALIZATION

Let us discuss the localization argument on supergrav-
ity based on the results in previous section. As explained
above, the only embarrassing term is the mass term for
graviton ψµ, or equivalently χ or λ in (11) or (12), which
prevails the SUSY invariance of SUSY exact term (13)
and (14). To overcome the problem, here we try to elim-
inate it just by inserting the delta function δ(Lc) to the
path integral in (10);

Z(t) = Z Deµ

aDψµDS δ(LC )ei R d3xLEH +i R d3xLC+itδV ,

(15)

where we take S = R (LEH + LC), and δV is the one

(11) or (12). It might look strange, but since the delta
function can be written by introducing auxiliary ﬁeld ϕ
as an integral formula,

δ(LC ) = Z Dϕ ei R d3xLC ·ϕ,

(16)

we can rewrite (15) as

Z(t) = Z Deµ

aDψµDSDϕ ei R d3xLEH +i R d3xLC(1+ϕ)+itδV .

(17)

If the supersymmetric invariance for the deformed cosmo-
logical constant term and for the path integral measure
are achieved, then this Z(t) becomes t-independent, and
we can utilize the localization technique by taking t → ∞
limit. For that purpose, we require

δ(ϕLc) = 0.

(18)

If the SUSY variation of the cosmological constant term
is total divergence, say, δLC = ∇µJ µ, then (18) implies
that δϕ should be deﬁned linear with respect to ϕ such
as

δϕ = −

∇µJ µ

LC

ϕ .

(19)

However this induces quantum anomaly, i.e. Jacobian
for supersymmetry variation of ϕ is not one. In order to
apply the conventional supersymmetric localization tech-
nique, the Jacobian for supersymmetry variation should
vanish, therefore this naive method does not work, un-
fortunately.

V. CONCLUSION, DISCUSSION, AND

FUTURE WORK

In this notes, we discussed a possibility for the appli-
cation of localization technique to the quantum gravity
path integral. We tried to conduct direct gravity path
integral by constructing SUSY exact terms in 3D super-
gravity. Although SUSY exact terms are constructed,
naive procedure for localization calculation fails. Our
main discovery is that the R2
µν supersymmetric invari-
, and R2 supersymmetric invariant, LR2 , can
ant, LR2
be represented as SUSY exact terms up to gravitino mass
terms, which break supersymmetric invariance and its
breaking is given by the supersymmetric cosmological
constant term LC. This prevents us from applying a
naive localization technique to supergravity within these
setups [18]. We would like to make some comments about
our (rather negative) results.

µν

First, let us comment on the diﬃculty of the gravity
sector localization computation. In our case, as one can
ﬁnd the algebraic structure of local SUSY δ on 3D super-
gravity in [5], squared SUSY δ2 is not zero and contains
SUSY δ, too. This structure is coming from the exis-
tence of gravitino, and it is absent in the rigid SUSY limit
δrigid [6] which guarantees the localization computation
because of the nilpotent nature δ2
rigid = 0 in many cases.
However, the possibility for localization in supergravity is
not excluded even for 3D N = 1 because what we found
is just the relationship (11) - (14). Therefore, if one can

3

ﬁnd certain better SUSY exact terms and succeed in can-
celing the obstructing mass term, then it should work.

Second, the mass terms in our SUSY exact Laglan-
gians, (11) and (12), seem to be “universal” mass terms
because they are always proportional to the supersym-
metric cosmological constant LC in (4). We have no a
priori reason to get such supersymmetric coeﬃcient as
the mass parameter, but there might exist certain deep
reason which could be related to the algebraic structure
on supergravity.

Third, it may be good to consider the same problem
with extended local supersymmetries, N ≥ 2. For exam-
ple, we can ﬁnd oﬀ-shell formulation of N = 2 supergrav-
ity in [7]. In 3D, conventional ﬁeld theoretical localiza-
tion computation is available only for N ≥ 2, therefore
situation there could be better.

It will be also interesting to consider the analog of
our argument with Euclidean supergravity.
(For rele-
vant works on 3D Euclidean pure gravity with negative
cosmological constant, see for example, [3, 8, 9].) Cru-
cial diﬀerence is that in Euclidean signature, modular
invariance is strong enough to determine (some of) non-
perturbative eﬀects. It would be great if we can derive
the summation over Modular group discussed in [9–12] in
direct supergravity localization calculation without rely-
ing on the power of modular invariance. This should be
done along the line of [3], where the sum over modular
group appears naturally as the sum over all of the lo-
calization locus, Fµν = 0, which are solutions of all the
complex Einstein equation.

Before we end, let us discuss the physical meaning of

conducting gravity path integral, Z = R [Dgµν ]eiS[gµν ].

Even if we succeed in conducting the metric path integral
[Dgµν] exactly, whether it gives an exact partition func-
tion for quantum gravity or not, depends on whether the
metric gµν is a fundamental degree of freedom in quan-
tum gravity. We have learned from holography that bulk
gravity is an eﬀective theory, which is valid and emerging
typically in the large N limit of QCD-like SU (N ) gauge
theory as a dual eﬀective description. Furthermore, a
metric, which is dual to gauge-singlet stress-tensor, is a
dominating degree of freedom only in low temperature
phase [13, 14]. In fact, in high temperature phase, rather
than metric, black hole microstates are the dominating
degrees of freedom [19]. Given these, how much is the
bulk metric path integral meaningful calculation?

To answer this, the analogy to QCD helps; gravity
in low temperature phase is like chiral Lagrangian in
QCD, where the dynamical degrees of freedom are pion
ﬁeld π’s, instead of quarks and gluons. Then conduct-

ing gravity path integral R [Dgµν]eiS[gµν ] corresponds to
conducting pion ﬁeld path integral R [Dπ]eiSchiral in the

chiral lagrangian. Of course we know the fundamental
theory behind chiral lagrangian is QCD, and the exact
answer for the partition function for QCD can be ob-
tained only after by conducting the path integral for
quark-gluon ﬁelds, rather than pion ﬁelds. Pion ﬁeld
path integral of the chiral lagrangian never gives the right

answer for QCD, due to its lack of quark and gluon de-
grees of freedom which are dominating in high temper-
ature phase [20]. As one cannot describe quark-gluon
plasma by multi-pion ﬁelds, we expect that black hole mi-
crostates are not describable by multi-gravitons (see [15]
for a nice overview) [21]. In this way, we expect that the

naive bulk metric path integral, Z = R [Dgµν ]eiS[gµν ], is

not non-perturbatively-deﬁned quantity, at least in bulk
where we have space-time dimensions larger than three.
(Note however in three-dimension, modular invariance
of the partition function is powerful enough to deter-
mine the contributions of BTZ black hole microstates,
see [3, 8, 9, 16].) To obtain an exact partition function
for full quantum gravity, we have to rely on the dual
non-perturbatively deﬁned boundary theory path inte-
gral [22].

However what we try to calculate in this paper is not
this quantity (partition function), but rather supersym-
metric index due to the fermion boundary condition.
Then the situation is totally diﬀerent:
Index calcula-
tions in ﬁeld theory quite often works to count the su-
persymmetric black hole microstates. This is because of
supersymmetry, signiﬁcant reduction of degrees of free-
dom occurs. Therefore, the SUSY index calculation from

the bulk metric by conducting R [Dgµν ] is still meaningful

even in bulk.

[17] Here, we consider the partition function with Lorentz
signature. So it is plausible to take the weight as eiS. In
the t → ∞ limit, the conﬁguration which satisfy δV = 0
is dominant thanks to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma.

[18] However, as commented in [4], the bosonic part of the
equation LR2 = 0 is exactly equivalent to the integra-
bility condition for the Killing spinor equation which is
equivalent to the condition δψµ = 0. This fact might illu-
minate the possibility of localization calculous with LR2
action, but of course, we should overcome the graviton
mass term problem in (14).

[19] These can easily seen from comparison of the N -
dependence of the entropy between thermal-gas/black
holes in bulk and conﬁnement/deconﬁnement phase in
the boundary [13, 14].

[20] If we pay attention to physics only in the conﬁnement
phase, namely, only low temperature phase and neglect
all non-perturbative eﬀects, then the results of pion path
integral of chiral lagrangian is still meaningful as an ef-
fective theory.

[21] Note also that the argument of [13, 14] works in bulk
where we have space-time dimensions larger than three.
Even in three dimensional space-time case, BTZ black
hole microstates are regarded as a diﬀerent primary’s
conformal family [3, 8, 9, 16].

[22] It gives, at most, approximately valid and meaningful
quantity only in low temperature phase, i.e., bulk phase
without black holes.
