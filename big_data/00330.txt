EQUIDIVISIBLE PSEUDOVARIETIES OF SEMIGROUPS

JORGE ALMEIDA AND ALFREDO COSTA

Abstract. We give a complete characterization of pseudovarieties of
semigroups whose ﬁnitely generated relatively free proﬁnite semigroups
are equidivisible. Besides the pseudovarieties of completely simple semi-
groups, they are precisely the pseudovarieties that are closed under
Mal’cev product on the left by the pseudovariety of locally trivial semi-
groups. A further characterization which turns out to be instrumental
is as the non-completely simple pseudovarieties that are closed under
two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion.

1. Introduction

A pseudovariety of semigroups is a class of ﬁnite semigroups closed un-
der taking subsemigroups, homomorphic images and ﬁnitary products. In
the past few decades, pseudovarieties provided the main framework for the
research on ﬁnite semigroups, motivated by Eilenberg’s correspondence the-
orem between pseudovarieties and varieties of languages.
In this context,
the ﬁnitely generated relatively free proﬁnite semigroups associated to each
pseudovariety proved to be of fundamental importance. We assume the
reader has some familiarity with this background. The books [19, 1] are
indicated as supporting references. The paper [2] might also be useful for
someone looking for a brief introduction.

In this paper we are concerned with equidivisible relatively free proﬁnite
semigroups. A semigroup S is equidivisible if for every u, v, x, y ∈ S, the
equality uv = xy implies that u = x and v = y, or that there is t ∈ S such
that ut = x and v = ty, or such that xt = u and y = tv. Equidivisible semi-
groups were introduced in [12] as a generalization of free semigroups. They
were further investigated in [13] where a characterization of the completely
simple semigroups as being a special class of equidivisible semigroups was
given (cf. Theorem 5.1).

A pseudovariety of semigroups V is said to be equidivisible if every ﬁnitely
generated free pro-V semigroup is equidivisible. The paper [4] includes re-
sults about a special class of semigroup pseudovarieties, the WGGM pseu-
dovarieties, the ones whose corresponding relatively free proﬁnite semigroups
are “weakly generalized group mapping”. In the same paper, the WGGM
condition is applied to obtain suﬃcient conditions for a pseudovariety to be
ﬁnitely join irreducible in the lattice of ordered pseudovarieties. It is also

shown in [4] that a suﬃcient condition for a semigroup pseudovariety V to
be WGGM is to be equidivisible and to contain LSl (the pseudovariety of ﬁ-
nite semigroups whose local monoids are semillatices). This adds motivation
to investigate the natural question: which pseudovarieties are equidivisible,
other than those of completely simple semigroups?

In this paper we give a complete characterization of the equidivisible
pseudovarieties of semigroups (Sec. 8), showing that those which are not
contained in the pseudovariety of completely simple semigroups are precisely
the ones of the form V = LI (cid:13)m V, where LI denotes the pseudovariety of locally
trivial semigroups and (cid:13)m denotes the Mal’cev product of pseudovarieties.

The semigroup pseudovarieties of the form V = A (cid:13)m V, where A denotes
the pseudovariety of aperiodic semigroups, are those whose corresponding
variety of languages is closed under language concatenation [23, 6]. In [3,
Lemma 4.8] it is shown that every such pseudovariety is equidivisible, with a
proof that uses the closure under concatenation. In contrast to the approach
made in [3] for this class of pseudovarieties, our proof of the equidivisibility
of the pseudovarieties of the form V = LI (cid:13)m V does not use a characteriza-
tion in terms of the corresponding varieties of languages, which are those
that are closed under unambiguous product of languages [14, 15]. For our
complete characterization of the equidivisible pseudovarieties, and in both
directions of the proof, we had to use a distinct approach, based on the
two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion of semigroups. This approach was
inspired by the proof given in [18] that if a pseudovariety of semigroups
V is stable under (one-sided) right Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion, then the
ﬁnitely generated free pro-V semigroups have unambiguous ≤R-order.
It
turns out that, by a deep result of Rhodes et al. [20, 21], the pseudovarieties
of the form V = LI (cid:13)m V are precisely those that are stable under two-sided
Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion (Corollary 3.3).

Roughly speaking, the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion keeps track
of the transition edges used to read a word in the two-sided Cayley graph
of the semigroup expanded. If we only keep track of the strongly connected
components, we obtain another expansion, which we call the two-sided con-
nected expansion. We deduce from our main result that a pseudovariety
is closed under two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion if and only if it is
closed under two-sided connected expansion (cf. Corollary 8.4).

Another by-product of our results concerns the pseudovariety LG of ﬁnite
semigroups whose local monoids are groups. After showing directly that the
equidivisible subpseudovarieties of LG are precisely those containing LI, we
apply our main result to deduce that, whenever V is a subpseudovariety of
LG, the join LI ∨ V is equal to the Mal’cev product LI (cid:13)m V (Corollary 8.6).

2. Preliminaries

Recall that [19, 1, 2] are our supporting references. We use the stan-
dard notation V ∨ W, V ∗ W, V ∗∗ W and V (cid:13)m W respectively for the join, the
semidirect product, the two-sided semidirect product, and the Mal’cev prod-
uct of pseudovarieties of semigroups. Occasionally (only in the preparatory

EQUIDIVISIBLE PSEUDOVARIETIES OF SEMIGROUPS

3

Section 3) we refer to pseudovarieties of semigroupoids (namely the pseu-
dovariety ℓI of trivial semigroupoids) and to varietal operations concerning
them. We refer to [19, 2] for details.

The following pseudovarieties of semigroups appear in this paper:

• S: ﬁnite semigroups;
• A: ﬁnite aperiodic semigroups;
• G: ﬁnite groups;
• I: trivial semigroups;
• D: ﬁnite semigroups all of whose idempotents are right zeros;
• K: ﬁnite semigroups all of whose idempotents are left zeros;
• LI = K ∨ D: ﬁnite semigroups whose local monoids are trivial;
• LG: ﬁnite semigroups whose local monoids are groups;
• LSl: ﬁnite semigroups whose local monoids are semilattices;
• CS: ﬁnite completely simple semigroups;
• CR: ﬁnite completely regular semigroups.

For a semigroup S, let SI be the monoid obtained from S by adding an
extra element I which is the identity of SI . This allows a convenient way
of writing the deﬁnition of equidivisibility: the semigroup S is equidivisible
when, for every u, v, x, y ∈ S, the equality uv = xy implies that there is
t ∈ SI such that ut = x and v = ty, or such that xt = u and y = tv.

If f : S → T is a semigroup homomorphism, then we extend f to a ho-
momorphism from SI to T I , also denoted f , by letting f (I) = I. Note
that, for every alphabet A, the monoid (A+)I can be identiﬁed with the
free monoid A∗ in a natural manner.
In particular, if ϕ is a homomor-
phism from A+ to a semigroup S, then we have a unique extension of ϕ to
a homomorphism from A∗ to SI , with ϕ(1) = I.

We were inspired by [18] in the use of semigroup expansions to obtain our
main result. With this reference in mind (see also [10]), we quickly recall
that, for a ﬁxed alphabet A, the category of A-generated semigroups is the
category SA whose objects are the pairs of the form (S, ϕ) in which ϕ is an
onto homomorphism A+ → S, and where morphisms (S, ϕ) → (T, ψ) are
the homomorphisms θ : S → T such that θ ◦ ϕ = ψ. An expansion cut to
generators deﬁned in SA is an endofunctor F : SA → SA equipped with a
natural transformation from F to the identity functor of SA. A convenient
way to refer to F is the notation correspondence (S, ϕ) 7→ (SF , ϕF ), where
the pair (SF , ϕF ) is the object F (S, ϕ).

3. The two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion

Let ϕ be a homomorphism from A+ onto a semigroup S. The two-
sided Cayley graph deﬁned by ϕ is the directed graph Γϕ whose set of
vertices is SI × SI , and where an edge from (s1, t1) to (s2, t2) is a triple
((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2)), with a ∈ A, such that s1ϕ(a) = s2 and t1 = ϕ(a)t2.
Giving to each edge ((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2)) the label a, the graph Γϕ becomes a
semi-automaton over the alphabet A. A labeling of paths is inherited from
the labeling of edges in an obvious way. If u ∈ A+, then we denote by pϕ,u,
or simply pu if ϕ is understood, the unique path from (I, ϕ(u)) to (ϕ(u), I)
labeled by u.

, if the dependency on ϕ is implicitly understood.

For an edge t in a directed graph H, we denote by α(t) its source and by
ω(t) is target. The edge t is a transition edge of H if α(t) and ω(t) are not
in the same strongly connected component of H. Returning our attention
to the two-sided Cayley graph Γϕ, for a path p in Γϕ, denote by T (p) the
set of transition edges in p. Let ≡ϕ be the binary relation on A+ deﬁned by
u ≡ϕ v if and only if ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) and T (pu) = T (pv). The relation u ≡ϕ v is
a congruence, a well-known fact whose routine proof is similar to the explicit
proof we give later of an analogous result, Lemma 4.1. Denote by SK(ℓI)
the
quotient A+/≡ϕ and by ϕK(ℓI) the corresponding quotient homomorphism
A+ → SK(ℓI)
. For the sake of simplicity, we will write SK(ℓI) instead of
SK(ℓI)
ϕ
It is well known that the correspondence (S, ϕ) 7→ (SK(ℓI), ϕK(ℓI)) is an
expansion cut to generators, which is called the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes
expansion. There is an alternative way of deﬁning this expansion, which
puts it as a special case within a more general framework, and which we
refer brieﬂy, leaving the details for the bibliographic references supporting
our discussion. The two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion is an example
of a two-sided semidirect product expansion deﬁned by a variety of semi-
groups (in this case, the variety of trivial semigroups), as introduced by
Elston in [10]. In [18], a variation of this approach is followed, one where
pseudovarieties of semigroupoids are used instead of varieties of semigroups.
The notation SK(ℓI) is consistent with the notation used in [18] for the two-
sided semidirect product expansion SK(V) of a proﬁnite semigroup S deﬁned
by a pseudovariety V of semigroupoids. As observed in [18, Sec. 10], if V is
a pseudovariety of semigroups, then SK(ℓV) is the corresponding expansion
SK(V) introduced by Elston.

Suppose that the alphabet A is ﬁnite. If S is ﬁnite then SK(ℓI) is ﬁnite,
because a kernel class of ϕK(ℓI) is determined by a kernel class of ϕ together
with a set of transition edges of Γϕ, and there is only a ﬁnite number of such
classes and edges.

More generally, as explained in [18, Sec. 10], if S is ﬁnite and V is a locally
ﬁnite pseudovariety of semigroupoids (which is the case of ℓI), then SK(V) is
a ﬁnite semigroup which is in a natural way a two-sided semidirect product
(ΩΓϕ
V) ∗∗ S, and so if S belongs to a pseudovariety W of semigroups, then
SK(V) belongs to V ∗∗ W.

As remarked at the beginning of Section 11 of [18], the isomorphism be-
tween the quotient A+/≡ϕ and the two-sided semidirect product (ΩΓϕℓI)∗∗S
is justiﬁed by Tilson’s result asserting that two paths in a graph X coincide
in the locally trivial free category generated by X if and only if they have
the same transition edges.

The following result is a special case of [19, Theorem 3.6.4].

Proposition 3.1. Let W be a locally ﬁnite pseudovariety and let A be a
ﬁnite alphabet. Then (ΩAW)K(ℓI) is isomorphic to ΩA(ℓI ∗∗ W).

It is an easy exercise to show, directly from the deﬁnition we gave of the
two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion, that if π is the canonical projection
SK(ℓI) → S then the semigroup π−1(e) satisﬁes the identity xyz = xz, for
every idempotent e of S. Actually, as remarked in the proof of Lemma 3.4

EQUIDIVISIBLE PSEUDOVARIETIES OF SEMIGROUPS

in [16], we have ℓI ∗∗ V ⊆ [[xyz = xz]] (cid:13)m V, and so ℓI∗∗ V ⊆ LI (cid:13)m V. Denote by

Sn≥1 ℓI ∗∗n V the sequence of semigroup pseudovarieties recursively deﬁned

ℓI ∗∗n V = ℓI ∗∗ (ℓI ∗∗n−1 V), n ≥ 1.

ℓI ∗∗0 V = V,

by

The following theorem is a deep result of Rhodes et al. [20, 21] which the
reader can ﬁnd in [19, Corollary 5.3.22].

Theorem 3.2. Let V be a pseudovariety of semigroups. Then we have

LI (cid:13)m V =Sn≥0 ℓI ∗∗n V.

Say that a pseudovariety of semigroups V is closed under the two-sided
Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion if we have SK(ℓI)
∈ V whenever S ∈ V and ϕ is
a homomorphism from a ﬁnitely generated free semigroup onto S. For the
reader’s convenience, we give a proof of the following easy consequence of
Theorem 3.2.

Corollary 3.3. A pseudovariety of semigroups V is closed under the two-
sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion if and only if V = LI (cid:13)m V.

Proof. Suppose that V = LI (cid:13)m V. Let S ∈ V and consider a homomorphism
ϕ : A+ → S. Using the aforementioned fact that SK(ℓI)
∈ [[xyz = xz]] (cid:13)m V,
we immediately get that SK(ℓI)
∈ V, because [[xyz = xz]] ⊆ LI. Alternatively,
one can apply (the easy part of) Theorem 3.2, since SK(ℓI)

∈ ℓI ∗∗ V.

Conversely, suppose that V is closed under the two-sided Karnofsky-
Rhodes expansion. Let W be a locally ﬁnite subpseudovariety of V. Then
ΩAW belongs to V. By hypothesis, (ΩAW)K(ℓI) also belongs to V. Applying
Proposition 3.1, we conclude that ℓI ∗∗ W ⊆ V. As W can be any locally
ﬁnite subpseudovariety of V, we actually have ℓI ∗∗ V ⊆ V. We deduce from
Theorem 3.2 that LI (cid:13)m V = V.
(cid:3)

4. The two-sided connected expansion

In this section we show that the pseudovarieties closed under the two-sided
Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion are equidivisible. Actually, it is not necessary
to use the full force of the deﬁnition of the expansion. It suﬃces to use a
weaker expansion which we introduce in this section.

Let ϕ be a homomorphism from A+ onto a semigroup S. Given a path
p in the two-sided Cayley graph Γϕ, denote by C(p) the set of strongly
connected components of Γϕ that contain some vertex in p. Let ≈ϕ be the
binary relation on A+ deﬁned by u ≈ϕ v if and only if ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) and
C(pu) = C(pv).

Lemma 4.1. The relation ≈ϕ is a congruence.

Proof. The relation ≈ϕ is clearly an equivalence. Taking into account the
symmetry of its deﬁnition, to prove that ≈ϕ is a congruence, it suﬃces to
show that C(puw) = C(pvw) whenever u, v, w ∈ A+ are such that u ≈ϕ v.
Let x be a vertex of puw that is not in pvw, where u ≈ϕ v. Then, as
ϕ(u) = ϕ(v), we necessarily have x = (ϕ(u1), ϕ(u2w)) for some u1, u2 ∈ A+
such that u = u1u2. Since x′ = (ϕ(u1), ϕ(u2)) is a vertex of pu, there is
some vertex x′′ in pv such that x′ and x′′ are in the same strongly connected
component. Let t be the label of a path from x′ to x′′, and let z be the label

6

JORGE ALMEIDA AND ALFREDO COSTA

of a path from x′′ to x′. We have x′′ = (ϕ(v1), ϕ(v2)) for some v1, v2 ∈ A∗
such that v = v1v2. Note that

(4.1) ϕ(u1t) = ϕ(v1), ϕ(u2) = ϕ(tv2), ϕ(v1z) = ϕ(u1), ϕ(v2) = ϕ(zu2).

Consider the vertex x′′′ = (ϕ(v1), ϕ(v2w)). Looking at (4.1), we see that
we also have ϕ(u2w) = ϕ(tv2w) and ϕ(v2w) = ϕ(zu2w), whence there is
a path from x to x′′′ labeled t, and a path from x′′′ to x labeled z. This
shows that x′′′ belongs to the strongly connected component of x. Since x′′′
belongs to pvw, this establishes the inclusion C(puw) ⊆ C(pvw). Dually, we
have C(pvw) ⊆ C(puw).
(cid:3)

If S is ﬁnite then ≈ϕ has ﬁnite index, because a ≈ϕ-class is deﬁned by
a kernel class of ϕ together with a set of strongly connected components
of Γϕ, and there is only a ﬁnite number of such classes and components.

We denote by SC the quotient A+/≈ϕ and by ϕC the canonical homo-
morphism A+ → SC. Clearly, if ϕK(ℓI)(u) = ϕK(ℓI)(v) then ϕC (u) = ϕC(v),
and so SC is a quotient of SK(ℓI). The semigroups SC and SK(ℓI) may
not be isomorphic. For example, consider the onto homomorphism ϕ from
the two-letter alphabet A = {a, b} onto the trivial semigroup S. Then
ϕC (a) = ϕC(b) but ϕK(ℓI)(a) 6= ϕK(ℓI)(b).

Proposition 4.2. The correspondence (S, ϕ) 7→ (SC, ϕC ) is an expansion
cut to generators.

Proof. Let ϕ : A+ → S and ψ : A+ → T be onto homomorphisms, and let
f : S → T be a homomorphism such that f ◦ ϕ = ψ. The mapping f
induces a homomorphism ¯f of semi-automata from Γϕ to Γψ, deﬁned by the
following mappings from vertices and edges of Γϕ respectively to vertices
and edges of Γψ:

(s, t) 7→ (f (s), f (t)),

((s, t), a, (s′, t′)) 7→ ((f (s), f (t)), a, (f (s′), f (t′))).

u . Since u ≈ϕ v, there is a vertex x′ in pϕ

Let u, v ∈ A+ be such that u ≈ϕ v. Then we have ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) and
ψ(u) = ψ(v). Let y = (ψ(u1), ψ(u2)) be a vertex in pψ
u , where u = u1u2,
with u1, u2 ∈ A∗. Then y = ¯f (x), where x = (ϕ(u1), ϕ(u2)) is a vertex
in pϕ
v such that x and x′ are
in the same strongly connected component of Γϕ. Clearly, y = ¯f (x) and
y′ = ¯f (x′) are in the same strongly connected component of Γψ. As x′ is
in pϕ
v ). By symmetry, we
have C(pψ
v ). This establishes the equality u ≈ψ v, and therefore
we may consider the unique semigroup homomorphism f C : SC → T C such
that f C ◦ ϕC = ψC .

Let us call the expansion (S, ϕ) 7→ (SC , ϕC ) the two-sided connected ex-

pansion.

A pseudovariety of semigroups V is closed under two-sided connected ex-

pansion if we have SC whenever S ∈ V.

Proposition 4.3. If V is a pseudovariety of semigroups closed under two-
sided connected expansion then V is equidivisible.

Proof. Let A be a ﬁnite alphabet. Suppose u, v, x, y are elements of ΩAV
such that uv = xy. Let Φ be a continuous homomorphism onto a semi-
group S from V, and let ϕ be its restriction to A+. Denote by ΦC the unique
continuous homomorphism from ΩAV onto SC whose restriction to A+ co-
incides with ϕC . Consider elements u0, v0, x0, y0 of A+ such that ϕC (u0) =
ΦC(u), ϕC (v0) = ΦC(v), ϕC (x0) = ΦC(x) and ϕC (y0) = ΦC(y). The ver-
u0v0−−−→
tex (Φ(u), Φ(v)) = (ϕ(u0), ϕ(v0)) belongs to the path (I, ϕ(u0v0))
(ϕ(u0v0), I) of the two-sided Cayley graph Γϕ. Since uv = xy, we know
that ΦC(uv) = ΦC(xy). Therefore, there is a vertex (r, s) in the path
x0y0−−−→ (ϕ(u0v0), I) of Γϕ which lies in the strongly connected
(I, ϕ(u0v0))
component of (Φ(u), Φ(v)). Since (Φ(x), Φ(y)) is clearly also in the path
x0y0−−−→ (ϕ(u0v0), I), we conclude that in Γϕ there is a (possibly
(I, ϕ(u0v0))
empty) path from (Φ(u), Φ(v)) to (Φ(x), Φ(y)) or a path from (Φ(x), Φ(y))
to (Φ(u), Φ(v)).

Therefore, there is a word tΦ ∈ A∗ such that

(Φ(utΦ) = Φ(x)

Φ(v) = Φ(tΦy),

in which case we say that Φ is of the ﬁrst type, or there is a word τΦ ∈ A∗
such that

(Φ(xτΦ) = Φ(u)

Φ(y) = Φ(τΦv),

in which we say that Φ is of the second type. Note that Φ can be simultane-
ously of the ﬁrst type and of the second type. The result now follows from
a standard argument, which we write down for the reader’s convenience.
We know that ΩAV is the inverse limit of an inverse system of semigroups
from V deﬁned by a countable set of connecting onto homomorphisms of
the form πm,n : Sm → Sn, where m, n are arbitrary positive integers with
m ≥ n. For each n ≥ 1, let πn be the projection ΩAV → Sn associated to
this inverse system. Note that, for each n ≤ m, the homomorphism πn is
of the same type as πm. On the other hand, since there are only two types,
at least one of them occurs inﬁnitely often. Combining these two simple
observations we conclude that πn is of the ﬁrst type for every n ≥ 1, or of
the second type for every n ≥ 1. Without loss of generality, we assume the
former case. Denote tπn by tn. We have

(4.2)

πn(utn) = πn(x)

and πn(v) = πn(tny),

for every n ≥ 1. Let t be an accumulation point in (ΩAV)I of the sequence
(tn)n. Fix k ≥ 1, and let n ≥ k. Applying πn,k to (4.2), we get

πk(utn) = πk(x)

and πk(v) = πk(tny),

for every n ≥ k. By continuity of πk, we obtain

πk(ut) = πk(x)

and πk(v) = πk(ty).

This implies ut = x and v = ty. The case where πn is of the second type
for every n ≥ 1 leads to the existence of τ in (ΩAV)I such that xτ = u and
y = τ v.

Corollary 4.4. If V is a pseudovariety of semigroups closed under two-
sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion then V is equidivisible.

Proof. It follows immediately from Proposition 4.3 and the fact that the
two-sided connected expansion of a semigroup S is a homomorphic image of
the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion of S.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.5. If V is a pseudovariety of semigroups such that V = LI (cid:13)m V
then V is equidivisible.

Proof. Apply Corollary 4.4 and (the easy part of) Corollary 3.3.

(cid:3)

5. Equidivisible subpseudovarieties of CR

It was proved in [13] that every completely simple semigroup is equidivis-

ible. In fact, the following stronger result was established.

Theorem 5.1. A semigroup S is completely simple if and only if for every
u, v, x, y ∈ S, the equality uv = xy implies the existence of t1, t2 ∈ SI such
that ut1 = x, t1y = v, u = xt2, and y = t2v.

On the other hand we have the following simple fact.

Lemma 5.2. If V is a pseudovariety of completely regular semigroups con-
taining Sl then V is not equidivisible.

Proof. Consider the alphabet A = {a, b}. We claim that ΩAV is not equidi-
Indeed, we have ab · (ab)ω = a · b. On the other hand, since
visible.
c(ab) * c(a), there is no t ∈ (ΩAV)I such that ab · t = a. Similarly, there is
no t ∈ (ΩAV)I such that t · (ab)ω = b. This establishes the claim.
(cid:3)

Since a pseudovariety of completely regular semigroups not containing Sl
is contained in CS, combining Theorem 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 we deduce the
following result.

Corollary 5.3. A pseudovariety of completely regular semigroups is equidi-
visible if and only if it is contained in CS.
(cid:3)

6. Letter super-cancelability as a necessary condition for

equidivisibility

Let S be an A-generated compact semigroup. This implies S = SI A =
ASI . Say that S is right letter cancelative when, for every a ∈ A and
u, v ∈ SI , the equality ua = va implies u = v. Say moreover that S is
right letter super-cancelative when, for every a, b ∈ A and u, v ∈ SI , the
equality ua = vb implies a = b and u = v. We have the obvious dual notions
of left letter cancelative and left letter super-cancelative semigroup. If S is
simultaneously right and left letter (super-)cancelative, then we say S is
letter (super-)cancelative.

Say that a pseudovariety of semigroups V is right letter (super-)cancelative
if ΩAV is right letter (super-)cancelative, for every ﬁnite alphabet A. One
also has the dual notions of left letter (super-)cancelative and letter (super-)
cancelative pseudovariety.

Example 6.1. If V is a semigroup pseudovariety containing some nontrivial
monoid and such that V = V ∗ D, then V is letter super-cancelative (cf. [7,
Prop. 1.60] and [1, Exercise 10.2.10]).

In [4] one ﬁnds a characterization of the (right/left) super-cancelative
pseudovarieties as a routine exercise of application of basic results in the
theory of proﬁnite semigroups. The following simple observation is included
in that characterization.

Lemma 6.2. A semigroup pseudovariety V is right letter super-cancelative
if and only if D ⊆ V and V is right letter cancelative. Dually, V is left
letter super-cancelative if and only if K ⊆ V and V is left letter cancelative.
Therefore, V is letter super-cancelative if and only if LI ⊆ V and V is letter
cancelative.

Letter super-cancelability appears as a necessary condition for equidivis-

ibility in the following way.

Proposition 6.3. If V is an equidivisible pseudovariety of semigroups not
contained in CS then V is letter supper-cancelative.

Proof. Fix a ﬁnite alphabet A. Let u, v ∈ (ΩAS)I and let a, b ∈ A be such
that V |= ua = vb. Since ΩAV is equidivisible, there is t ∈ (ΩAV)I such that
V |= ut = v and V |= a = tb, or such that V |= vt = u and V |= b = ta.
Suppose that t 6= I. Suppose also that V |= a = tb. Replacing by a
every letter occurring in tb, we get V |= a = aν for some proﬁnite exponent
ν > 1. This implies that V ⊆ CR. Corollary 5.3 states that the equidivisible
subpseudovarieties of CR are precisely the subpseudovarieties of CS. Since
V is not contained in CS, we reach a contradiction. Similarly, V |= a = tb
leads to a contradiction. To avoid the contradiction, we must have t = I,
whence a = b and V |= u = v. Symmetrically, V |= au = bv implies a = b
and V |= u = v.
(cid:3)

Combining Proposition 6.3 with Lemma 6.2 we get the following corollary.

Corollary 6.4. If V is an equidivisible pseudovariety not contained in CS,
then V contains LI.
(cid:3)

7. Equidivisible subpseudovarieties of LG

Recall that the class LG of all ﬁnite local groups is the largest pseudova-
riety of semigroups whose semilattices are trivial. Local groups are thus
generalizations of completely simple semigroups that turn out to be some-
times much harder to handle. For our purposes, the following technical
result turns out to be essential.

Lemma 7.1. If V is a subpseudovariety of LG containing D, then V is right
letter super-cancelative.

Proof. Let u and v be pseudowords and a and b be letters such that the
pseudoidentity ua = vb holds in V. The pseudovariety D is right letter
super-cancelative, whence a = b and D satisﬁes u = v. In particular, u = v
or both u and v are inﬁnite pseudowords. Suppose the latter case occurs.
Let sn be the suﬃx of u of length n, which is also the suﬃx of length n of v,

10

that is, there are factorizations u = unsn and v = vnsn. By compactness,
there exists a convergent subsequence of the sequence of triples (un, vn, sn)
and, therefore, there exist pseudowords u′, v′, w, where w is inﬁnite, such
that u = u′w and v = v′w (in S). Since w is inﬁnite, there is a factorization
of the form w = w1wω
2 w3 [1, Corollary 5.6.2]. As V is contained in LG, it
must satisfy the following pseudoidentities:

w = w1wω

2 w3 = w1(wω

2 w3awω

2 )ωw3 = w1wω

2 w3at = wa · t

where t = (wω
ua = va, it also satisﬁes

2 w3awω

2 )ω−1w3. Hence, since the pseudovariety V satisﬁes

u = u′w = u′wa · t = ua · t = va · t = v′wa · t = v′w = v. (cid:3)

Theorem 7.2. A subpseudovariety of LG is equidivisible if and only if it is
contained in CS or it contains LI.

Proof. We already know that every subpseudovariety of CS is equidivisible
by Theorem 5.1. Thus, for the remainder of the proof, we assume that V is
a subpseudovariety of LG not contained in CS.

If V is equidivisible, then V contains LI by Corollary 6.4. For the converse,
suppose that V contains LI and that V satisﬁes the pseudoidentity uv = xy.
By Lemma 7.1, V is right letter super-cancelative. By duality, V is also
left letter super-cancelative. Therefore, to prove that there is a (possibly
empty) pseudoword t such that in V we have ut = x and v = ty, or xt = u
and y = tv, we may assume that all the pseudowords u, v, x, y are inﬁnite.
Hence, uv = xy may be viewed as an equality between products in the
minimum ideal of a suitable ΩAV, which is a completely simple semigroup.
By Theorem 5.1, we may conclude that V is equidivisible.
(cid:3)

8. Characterization of equidivisible pseudovarieties

Let ϕ be a homomorphism from A+ onto a semigroup S. Given u ∈ A+,
a transition edge for u in Γϕ is an element of T (pu). Note that T (pu) is
always nonempty, since there is no path from (ϕ(u), I) to (I, ϕ(u)) in Γϕ. If
A and S are ﬁnite, then T (pu) is ﬁnite and so, for some integer n, we can
consider the sequence (εi)i∈{1,...,n} of transition edges for u in Γϕ, where εi
is the i-th transition edge appearing in pu.

In this section we shall work primarily with the expansion ϕK(ℓI), but at
some point it will be convenient to use another expansion which we next
describe. In a graph, the content of a path p is the set c(p) of edges in the
path. Consider the relation ≡ϕ,Sl on A+ deﬁned by u ≡ϕ,Sl v if and only
if c(pu) = c(qv). Note that since pw starts at (I, ϕ(w)), if u ≡ϕ,Sl v then
ϕ(u) = ϕ(v) holds. The relation ≡ϕ,Sl is a congruence and the quotient ho-
momorphism A+ → A+/≡ϕ,Sl is precisely the two-sided semidirect product
expansion ϕK(ℓSl) : A+ → SK(ℓSl) (cf. [10, Sec. 5.4]).1

1The reader is cautioned for some misprints in the discussion made in [10, Sec. 5.4]; for
instance, at some point a map ψ is deﬁned that takes a word u to the set of edges in pu, and
not to the set of transition edges as by mistake it is written there. The characterization
of ϕK(ℓSl) is an application of [10, Corollary 5.4] and of a result of I. Simon [22] (a proof
of which may be found in [9, Theorem VIII.7.1]) stating that two paths in a graph have
the same content if and only if they are equal in the free category relatively to ℓSl.

EQUIDIVISIBLE PSEUDOVARIETIES OF SEMIGROUPS

11

Suppose moreover that A and S are ﬁnite. Then SK(ℓI) and SK(ℓSl) are
both ﬁnite semigroups. Denote by Φ (respectively, ΦK(ℓI) and ΦK(ℓSl)) the
unique continuous homomorphism from ΩAS onto S (respectively, SK(ℓI) and
SK(ℓSl)) whose restriction to A+ is ϕ (respectively, ϕK(ℓI) and ϕK(ℓSl)). Let
u ∈ ΩAS. Consider an arbitrary sequence (un)n of elements of A+ converging
to u. Then, there is N such that ΦK(ℓI)(u) = ϕK(ℓI)(un) for every n ≥ N .
Therefore, we can deﬁne a transition edge for u in Γϕ as being an element
of T (pun) for every suﬃciently large n, since this set depends only on ϕ
and u. In a similar way, one can deﬁne the sequence of transition edges for
u in Γϕ as being the sequence of transition edges for un in Γϕ for every
suﬃciently large n, and an edge for u in Γϕ as being an element of c(pun)
for every suﬃciently large n. Note that a transition edge for u is indeed an
edge for u.

If ψ is a continuous homomorphism from ΩAS onto a ﬁnite semigroup T ,
then we denote by Γψ the two-sided Cayley graph of the restriction of ψ
to A+. Since ψ is the unique continuous extension to ΩAS of its restric-
tion to A+, the homomorphisms ψK(ℓI) and ψK(ℓSl) are deﬁned in view of
the previous paragraph. Their images are also denoted SK(ℓI)
and SK(ℓSl)
,
respectively.

ϕ

Lemma 8.1. Let ϕ be a continuous homomorphism from ΩAS onto a ﬁnite
semigroup S, where A is a ﬁnite alphabet. Let u ∈ ΩAS. If ((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2))
is an edge for u in Γϕ, then there is a factorization u = u1au2 of u, with
u1, u2 ∈ (ΩAS)I , such that ϕ(u1) = s1 and ϕ(u2) = t2.
Proof. We may consider a sequence (un)n of elements of A+ converging to
u and such that ϕK(ℓSl)(un) = ϕK(ℓSl)(u) for every n.
In particular, for
every n, the edge ((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2)) is an edge for un in Γϕ, and so un
factors as un = un,1aun,2 for some un,1, un,2 ∈ A∗ such that ϕ(un,1) = s1
and ϕ(un,2) = t2. By compactness, the sequence of pairs (un,1, un,2) has
some accumulation point (u1, u2) in (ΩAS)I × (ΩAS)I . By continuity of
multiplication and of ϕ, we have u = u1au2, ϕ(u1) = s1 and ϕ(u2) = t2. (cid:3)
Lemma 8.2. Let θ : B+ → A+ be a homomorphism satisfying θ(B) = A,
for some alphabets A and B. Consider a homomorphism ϕ from A+ onto
a semigroup S. Let ψ be the homomorphism from B+ onto S such that
ψ = ϕ ◦ θ. Then we have

ψK(ℓI)(u) = ψK(ℓI)(v) =⇒ ϕK(ℓI)(θ(u)) = ϕK(ℓI)(θ(v)),

for every u, v ∈ B+. Consequently, SK(ℓI)

ϕ

is a homomorphic image of SK(ℓI)

ψ

.

Proof. The proof relies on the following fact: there is in Γψ a path from
(s1, t1) to (s2, t2) labeled by u ∈ B+ if and only if there is in Γϕ a path from
(s1, t1) to (s2, t2) labeled by θ(u) ∈ A+. In particular, ((s1, t1), b, (s2, t2)) is
a transition edge of Γψ if and only if ((s1, t1), θ(b), (s2, t2)) is a transition
edge of Γϕ.

Let u, v ∈ B+ be such that ψK(ℓI)(u) = ψK(ℓI)(v). Then we immediately
have ϕ(θ(u)) = ϕ(θ(v)). Suppose that ((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2)) is a transition
edge of Γϕ belonging to the path pθ(u). We have s1 = ϕ(w1) and t2 = ϕ(w2)
for some w1, w2 ∈ A∗ such that θ(u) = w1aw2. There is a factorization

12

JORGE ALMEIDA AND ALFREDO COSTA

u = u1bu2 with w1 = θ(u1), w2 = θ(u2) and a = θ(b). It then follows that
((s1, t1), b, (s2, t2)) is a transition edge of Γψ belonging to pu.
It belongs
also to pv, since ψK(ℓI)(u) = ψK(ℓI)(v). Therefore, ((s1, t1), a, (s2, t2)) is a
transition edge of Γϕ in pθ(v). Symmetrically, every transition edge of Γϕ
belonging to pθ(v) also belongs to pθ(u), establishing that ϕK(ℓI)(θ(u)) =
ϕK(ℓI)(θ(v)).

Therefore, we can consider the onto homomorphism ρ : SK(ℓI)

ψ → SK(ℓI)

ϕ

deﬁned by ρ(ψK(ℓI)(u)) = ϕK(ℓI)(θ(u)).

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove our main result.

Theorem 8.3. A pseudovariety of semigroups V is equidivisible if and only
if it is contained in CS or it is closed under the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes
expansion.

Proof. The “if” part follows from Corollaries 4.4 and 5.3.

Conversely, suppose that V is an equidivisible pseudovariety not contained
in CS. Let u, v be elements of ΩX S such that V |= u = v, where X is some
ﬁnite alphabet. For a ﬁnite alphabet A, let ϕ be a continuous homomor-
phism from ΩAS onto a semigroup S from V. Consider the ﬁnite alphabet
B = A∪ X. There is a continuous onto homomorphism θ : ΩB S → ΩAS such
that θ(B) = A. Let ψ be the unique continuous homomorphism from ΩB S
onto S such that ψ = ϕ ◦ θ. We will show that SK(ℓI)

|= u = v.

ψ

Viewing u, v as elements of ΩB S, and because V |= u = v, we have
ψ(u) = ψ(v). We claim that ψK(ℓI)(u) = ψK(ℓI)(v). Let (εi)i∈{1,...,n} and
(δi)i∈{1,...,m} be the sequences of transition edges in Γψ respectively for u
and for v. Without loss of generality, we may assume that n ≤ m.

Suppose that the set

(8.1)

{i ∈ {1, . . . , n} | εi 6= δi}

is nonempty, and let j be its minimum. By Lemma 8.1, there are factoriza-
tions u = u1au2 of u and v = v1bv2 of v, with a, b ∈ B and u1, u2, v1, v2 ∈
(ΩB S)I, such that

εj = ((ψ(u1), ψ(au2)), a, (ψ(u1a), ψ(u2))

and

δj = ((ψ(v1), ψ(bv2)), b, (ψ(v1b), ψ(v2)).

Note that α(εj ) and α(δj ) belong to the same strongly connected component
of Γψ, by the minimality of the index j.

Since V |= u1a · u2 = v1 · bv2 and V is equidivisible, there is t ∈ (ΩB S)I

such that

(8.2)

or

(8.3)

V |= u1at = v1

and V |= u2 = tbv2,

V |= v1t = u1a and V |= bv2 = tu2.

If Case (8.2) holds, then there is in Γψ a (possibly empty) path from ω(εj)
to α(δj ), labeled by a word t0 ∈ B∗ such that ψ(t0) = ψ(t). Since α(δj)
and ω(δj) belong to the same strongly connected component, we conclude

EQUIDIVISIBLE PSEUDOVARIETIES OF SEMIGROUPS

13

there is in Γψ a path from ω(εj) to α(εj ), contradicting the fact that εj is a
transition edge.

Therefore, Case (8.3) holds with t 6= I. By Proposition 6.3, it follows

from (8.3) that there is t′ ∈ (ΩB S)I with t = t′a and

(8.4)

V |= v1t′ = u1

and V |= bv2 = t′au2.

Suppose that t′ 6= I. Again by Proposition 6.3, it follows from (8.4) that

there is t′′ ∈ (ΩB S)I with t′ = bt′′ and

(8.5)

V |= v1b · t′′ = u1

and V |= v2 = t′′ · au2.

This implies the existence of a path in Γψ from ω(δj) to α(εj ), which once
more leads to a contradiction with the deﬁnition of a transition edge.

Therefore, we have t′ = I, and so, thanks to Proposition 6.3, from (8.4)
we get V |= v1 = u1, a = b and V |= v2 = u2. This yields εj = δj, which
contradicts the initial assumption. Therefore, the set (8.1) is empty.
In
particular, εn = δn holds. Since εn is the last transition edge for u, we have
ω(δn) = (ψ(u), I), which means that δn is the last transition edge for v,
whence m = n and εi = δi for every i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. This concludes the proof
that ψK(ℓI)(u) = ψK(ℓI)(v).

Now, let ζ be an arbitrary continuous homomorphism from ΩB S into
SK(ℓI)
. Because ψK(ℓI) is onto, there is a continuous endomorphism λ of
ψ
ΩB S such that ζ = ψK(ℓI) ◦ λ. Since we also have V |= λ(u) = λ(v), we
deduce that ζ(u) = ζ(v). This establishes our claim that SK(ℓI)

|= u = v.

ψ

Applying Lemma 8.2, we conclude that SK(ℓI)

Theorem [17], we deduce that SK(ℓI)
under the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion.

|= u = v. By Reiterman’s
∈ V, thus proving that V is closed
(cid:3)

Corollary 8.4. Let V be a pseudovariety of semigroups. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(1) V is equidivisible and it is not contained in CS;
(2) V = LI (cid:13)m V;
(3) V is closed under the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion;
(4) V is closed under the two-sided connected expansion.

Proof. The equivalence (2)⇔(3) is Corollary 3.3. In particular, a pseudovari-
ety closed under the the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion contains LI.
As LI is not contained in CS, the equivalences (1)⇔(2)⇔(3) then follow
from Theorem 8.3. Since the two-sided connected expansion is a quotient of
the two-sided Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion, we clearly have (3)⇒(4). Con-
versely, suppose that V is closed under the two-sided connected expansion.
By Proposition 4.3, V is equidivisible. We claim that V is not contained
in CS. Consider the mapping ϕ from Ω{a}
S onto the trivial semigroup
S = {1}. The path in Γϕ from (I, 1) to (1, I) labeled a intersects pre-
cisely two strongly connected components of Γϕ, while, for every k ≥ 2, the
path in Γϕ from (I, 1) to (1, I) labeled ak intersects precisely three strongly
connected components of Γϕ. Therefore, denoting by ϕC the canonical con-
tinuous homomorphism from Ω{a}S to SC whose restriction to {a}+ is the
connected expansion of ϕ|{a}+, we have ϕC (a) 6= ϕC (aω+1). This shows

14

JORGE ALMEIDA AND ALFREDO COSTA

that SC /∈ CR, establishing the claim, and concluding the proof that we
have (4)⇒(1).
(cid:3)

There is one important further connection of the conditions of Corol-
lary 8.4 with varieties of languages. Indeed, as has been proved by Pin [14]
(cf. [15, Theorem 7.3]), the language counterpart of the operator V 7→ LI (cid:13)m V
is the closure under unambiguous product.

We conclude the paper with one further application of our results for
pseudovarieties of local groups. Combining Corollary 8.4 with Theorem 7.2,
we obtain the following.

Corollary 8.5. If V is a subpseudovariety of LG containing LI then V =
LI (cid:13)m V.
(cid:3)

It is well known that LI ∨ H = LI (cid:13)m H for every pseudovariety H of groups
[11, Corollary 3.2]. The previous results provide an indirect proof of the
following extension of that fact, which appears to be new.

Corollary 8.6. If V is a subpseudovariety of LG then LI ∨ V = LI (cid:13)m V.

Proof. Let V be a subpseudovariety of LG. Then the pseudovariety LI ∨ V is
equidivisible by Theorem 7.2. Therefore, applying Corollary 8.5, we obtain
LI ∨ V = LI (cid:13)m(LI ∨ V) ⊇ LI (cid:13)m V ⊇ LI ∨ V.
(cid:3)

Reading [8, Corollary 4.3] one ﬁnds the following basis for LI ∨ CS:

LI ∨ CS = [[zω(xy)ωxtω = zωxtω, xyωz = (xyωz)ω+1]].

As an example of application of Corollary 8.6, we obtain a simpliﬁed basis
for LI ∨ CS, made of a pseudoidentity involving only three letters.

Proposition 8.7. The pseudovariety LI∨CS is deﬁned by the pseudoidentity
(xy)ω(xz)ω(xy)ω = (xy)ω.

Proof. By [5, Theorem 6.1], taking Σ = {(zt)ωz = z}, H = I, W = {x1},
m = 0, and α1 = xω+1
, we obtain that the pseudovariety LI (cid:13)m CS is deﬁned
by the following pseudoidentities:

1

(cid:16)(cid:0)x(zt)ωzy(cid:1)ωxzy(cid:0)x(zt)ωzy(cid:1)ω(cid:17)ω
(xzy)ω−1(cid:0)x(zt)ωzy(cid:1)ω+1(xzy)ω = (xzy)ω.

=(cid:0)x(zt)ωzy(cid:1)ω

(8.6)

(8.7)

Note that the ﬁrst of these pseudoidentities is valid in LG while the pseudova-
riety deﬁned by the second one is contained in LG. Hence, LI (cid:13)m CS is deﬁned
by the pseudoidentity (8.7). Further simpliﬁcations of the pseudoidentity
(8.7) may be carried out as follows. First, since it deﬁnes a subpseudovariety
of LG, the (ω+1)-power of the inﬁnite element in the middle may be replaced
by the base of that power. Second, pre-multiplying both sides by zy, post-
multiplying by x(zyx)ω−1 and applying suitable conjugations to shift inﬁnite
powers, we obtain the pseudoidentity (zyx)ω(zt)ω(zyx)ω = (zyx)ω. Substi-
tuing x by zy, we deduce the equivalent pseudoidentity (zy)ω(zt)ω(zy)ω =
(zy)ω, as the former can be recovered by substituting in the latter y by yx.
Renaming variables, this shows that (xy)ω(xz)ω(xy)ω = (xy)ω is a simpliﬁed
basis for LI (cid:13)m CS. Finally, we apply Corollary 8.6.
