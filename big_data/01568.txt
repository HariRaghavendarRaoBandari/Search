EXACT FACTORIZATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF

FUSION CATEGORIES

SHLOMO GELAKI

Abstract. We introduce and study the new notion of an exact
factorization B = A • C of a fusion category B into a product of
two fusion subcategories A, C ⊆ B of B. This is a categorical gen-
eralization of the well known notion of an exact factorization of a
ﬁnite group into a product of two subgroups. We then relate exact
factorizations of fusion categories to exact sequences of fusion cat-
egories with respect to an indecomposable module category, which
was introduced and studied in [EG]. We also apply our results to
study extensions of a group-theoretical fusion category by another
one, provide some examples, and propose a few natural questions.

1. introduction

Finite groups with exact factorization are fundamental objects in
group theory which naturally show up in many interesting results in
the theories of Hopf algebras and tensor categories (see, e.g., [BGM],
[K], [M], [Na], [O]). Recall that a ﬁnite group G admits an exact
factorization G = G1G2 into a product of two subgroups G1, G2 ⊆ G
of G if G1 and G2 intersect trivially and the order of G is the product
of the orders of G1 and G2. Equivalently, G = G1G2 is an exact
factorization if every element g ∈ G can be uniquely written in the
form g = g1g2, where g1 ∈ G1 and g2 ∈ G2.

Our ﬁrst goal in this paper is to provide a categorical generalization
of the notion of exact factorizations of ﬁnite groups. More precisely, we
introduce and study the new notion of an exact factorization B = A • C
of a fusion category B into a product of two fusion subcategories A, C ⊆
B of B. We say that B = A • C is an exact factorization if A ∩ C = Vec
and FPdim(B) = FPdim(A)FPdim(C). Then in Theorem 3.8 we prove
that B = A • C if and only if every simple object of B can be uniquely
expressed in the form X ⊗ Y , where X, Y are simple objects of A, C,
respectively. For example, exact factorizations B = Vec(G1) • Vec(G2)

are classiﬁed by groups G with exact factorization G = G1G2 and a
cohomology class ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) which is trivial on G1 and G2 (but
not necessarily on G).

Recall next that the theory of exact sequences of tensor categories
was introduced by A. Brugui`eres and S. Natale [BN1, BN2] as a cate-
gorical generalization of the theory of exact sequences of Hopf algebras.
In their deﬁnition of an exact sequence of tensor categories

A ι−→ B F−→ C

the category A is forced to have a tensor functor to Vec (so to be
the representation category of a Hopf algebra). Later on in [EG] we
generalized the deﬁnition of [BN1] further to eliminate this drawback,
and in particular to include the example of the Deligne tensor prod-
uct B := A ⊠ C for any ﬁnite tensor categories A, C. We did so by
replacing the category Vec by the category End(N ) of endofunctors of
an indecomposable A-module category N , and deﬁned the notion of
an exact sequence

(1)

A ι−→ B F−→ C ⊠ End(N )

with respect to N . We showed that the dual of an exact sequence is
again an exact sequence. We also showed that for any exact sequence
(1), FPdim(B) = FPdim(A)FPdim(C), and that this property in fact
characterizes exact sequences (provided that ι is injective, F is sur-
jective, and A ⊆ Ker(F )). Moreover, we showed that if in an exact
sequence (1), A and C are fusion categories, then so is B.

Our second goal in this paper is to relate exact factorizations of
fusion categories with exact sequences. More precisely, in Theorem 4.1
we prove that an exact sequence of fusion categories (1) deﬁnes an exact
factorization B∗
N , and vice versa, any exact factorization
B = A • C of fusion categories gives rise to an exact sequence (1) with
respect to any indecomposable module category N over A.

C⊠N = C • A∗

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we recall some
necessary background on module categories over fusion categories, ex-
act sequences of fusion categories, and the class of group-theoretical
fusion categories. In Section 3 we introduce and study factorizations
B = AC and exact factorizations B = A • C of a fusion category B
into a product of fusion subcategories A, C ⊆ B of B. In Section 4 we
prove Theorem 4.1, in which we relate exact factorizations of fusion
categories to exact sequences of fusion categories with respect to an in-
decomposable module. We then apply our results to group-theoretical
fusion categories, and deduce in Corollary 4.2 that any extension of a
group-theoretical fusion category by another one is Morita equivalent

EXACT FACTORIZATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF FUSION CATEGORIES 3

to a fusion category with an exact factorization into a product of two
group-theoretical fusion subcategories. We also discuss some examples
of exact factorizations and exact sequences (e.g., of Kac (quasi-)Hopf
algebras in Corollary 4.4), and propose some natural questions.

Remark 1.1. We plan to extend the results of this paper to non-
semisimple ﬁnite tensor categories in a subsequent paper.

2. Preliminaries

Throughout the paper, k will denote an algebraically closed ﬁeld of
characteristic 0. All the categories mentioned in this paper are assumed
to be k-linear abelian.

We refer the reader to the book [EGNO] as a general reference for

the theory of fusion categories.

2.1. Module categories. Let A be a fusion category over k (see
[EGNO]). Let M be a left A-module category, and let N be a right A-
module category. Consider the tensor product N ⊠A M (see [ENO2]).
Namely, if A1, A2 are algebras in A such that M = mod − A1 and
N = A2 − mod, then N ⊠A M is the category of (A2, A1)-bimodules
in A, which can also be described as the category of left A2-modules
in M, or the category of right A1-modules in N (see [EGNO, Section
7.8]).

Recall that a left A-module category M is said to be indecomposable
if it is not a direct sum of two nonzero module categories. Let M be
an indecomposable A-module category1. Let End(M) be the abelian
category of endofunctors of M, and let A∗
M := EndA(M) be the dual
category of A with respect to M, i.e., the category of A−linear endo-
functors of M. Recall that composition of functors turns End(M) into
a monoidal category, and A∗

M into a fusion category.

Let Gr(A) be the Grothendieck ring of A. Recall that we have a
character FPdim : Gr(A) → R, attaching to X ∈ A the Frobenius-
Perron dimension FPdim(X) of X. Recall also that we have a virtual
object RA ∈ Gr(A) ⊗Z R, such that XRA = RAX = FPdim(X)RA for

1Here and below, by “a module category” we will mean a left module category,

unless otherwise speciﬁed.

4

SHLOMO GELAKI

all X ∈ Gr(A). Namely, we have RA = Pi FPdim(Xi)Xi, where Xi
are the simple objects of A. We set FPdim(A) := FPdim(RA) [ENO1].
Also, if M is an indecomposable A-module category, let Gr(M) be
the Grothendieck group of M. Let {Mj} be the basis of simple objects
of M. It follows from the Frobenius-Perron theorem that there is a
unique up to scaling element RM ∈ Gr(M) ⊗Z R such that for every
X ∈ Gr(A), XRM = FPdim(X)RM. Namely, we have that RM =
Pj FPdim(Mj)Mj. The numbers FPdim(Mj) are deﬁned uniquely up
to scaling by the property

FPdim(X ⊗ M) = FPdim(X)FPdim(M), X ∈ A, M ∈ M,

and it is convenient to normalize them in such a way that FPdim(RM) =
FPdim(A), which we will do from now on (see [EGNO, Proposition
3.4.4, Exercise 7.16.8], and [ENO2, Subsection 2.2]). It is clear that
RAMj = FPdim(Mj)RM.

2.2. Exact sequences of fusion categories with respect to a
module category. Let A ⊆ B, C be fusion categories, and let M be
an indecomposable module category over A. Let F : B → C ⊠ End(M)
be a surjective (= dominant) functor such that A = Ker (F ) (= the
subcategory of X ∈ B such that F (X) ∈ End(M)). Recall [EG] that
F deﬁnes an exact sequence

(2)

A ι−→ B F−→ C ⊠ End(M)

with respect to M (= F is normal), if for every object X ∈ B there
exists a subobject X0 ⊆ X such that F (X0) is the largest subobject of
F (X) contained in End(M) ⊆ C ⊠ End(M). In this case we will also
say that B is an extension of C by A with respect to M [EG].

Note that if M = Vec, this deﬁnition coincides with that of [BN1].
In particular, if H ⊆ G are ﬁnite groups, B := Rep(G), C := Rep(H),
F is the restriction functor, A := Ker(F ), and M := Vec, then F is
normal if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G, which motivates
the terminology. Also, it is clear that if B = C ⊠ A and F is the
obvious functor, then F deﬁnes an exact sequence with respect to M.
So C ⊠ A is an extension of C by A with respect to any indecomposable
A-module category M (e.g., M = A).

By [EG, Theorem 3.4], (2) deﬁnes an exact sequence of fusion cate-

gories if and only if FPdim(B) = FPdim(A)FPdim(C).

Let N be an indecomposable module category over C. Then N ⊠ M
is a module category over C ⊠ End(M), and (C ⊠ End(M))∗
N ⊠M = C∗
N .
By [EG, Theorem 4.1], the dual sequence to (2) with respect to N ⊠M:

is exact with respect to N .

2.3. Group-theoretical fusion categories. Let G be a ﬁnite group,
and let ω ∈ Z 3(G, k×) be a 3-cocycle. Let Vec(G, ω) be the fusion
category of ﬁnite dimensional G-graded vector spaces with associativity
deﬁned by ω. The simple objects of Vec(G, ω) are invertible and are in
correspondence with elements g of G.

Let L ⊆ G be a subgroup, and let ψ ∈ C 2(L, k×) be a 2-cochain such
that dψ = ω|L. Let M(L, ψ) be the corresponding indecomposable
module category over Rep(G), and let ˜M(L, ψ) be the corresponding
indecomposable module category over Vec(G, ω) (see [ENO1, Subsec-
tion 8.8]). Namely, M(L, ψ) is the category of representations of the
twisted group algebra kψ[L], while ˜M(L, ψ) = ModVec(G,ω)(kψ[L]) is
the category of right kψ[L]-modules in Vec(G, ω). The simple objects
of ˜M(L, ψ) are in correspondence with cosets gL in G/L.

Recall [O] that the group-theoretical fusion category C(G, ω, L, ψ) is
the dual category Vec(G, ω)∗
˜M(L,ψ) = BimodVec(G,ω)(kψ[L]). For exam-
ple, C(G, ω, 1, 1) = Vec(G, ω) and C(G, 1, G, 1) = Rep(G). By [O, The-
orem 3.1], the indecomposable module categories over C(G, ω, L, ψ) are
parametrized by the conjugacy classes of pairs (L1, ψ1) where L1 ⊆ G
is a subgroup such that ω|L1 = 1 and ψ1 ∈ H 2(L1, k×) is a cohomology
class. Namely, the module category corresponding to a pair (L1, ψ1) is
the category M(L1, ψ1) := BimodVec(G,ω)(kψ[L], kψ1[L1]). We have,

(4)

C(G, ω, L, ψ)∗

M(L1,ψ1) = C(G, ω, L1, ψ1).

For example, Rep(G)∗

M(L1,ψ1) = C(G, 1, L1, ψ1).

3. exact factorizations of fusion categories

Let B be a fusion category, and let A, C ⊆ B be fusion subcategories
of B. Let AC be the full abelian (not necessarily tensor) subcategory
of B spanned by direct summands in X ⊗ Y , where X ∈ A and Y ∈ C.

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that B factorizes into a product of A and C
if B = AC. (Equivalently, if B is an indecomposable module category
over A ⊠ Cop.)

For a full abelian subcategory E ⊆ A, let

FPdim(E) := X

FPdim(X)2,

X∈Irr(E)

and let RE := PX∈Irr(E) FPdim(X)X.

6

SHLOMO GELAKI

Lemma 3.2. Let B be a fusion category, let A, C ⊆ B be fusion sub-
categories of B, and let D := A ∩ C. Then

FPdim(A)FPdim(C) = FPdim(AC)FPdim(D).

Proof. Since AC is an indecomposable module category over A ⊠ Cop,
we have RARC = λRAC, since both RAC and RARC are positive eigen-
vectors for actions of A and C, and such a vector is unique up to scaling
(see Subsection 2.1). To ﬁnd λ, let us use the inner product given by
(X, Y ) := dim Hom(X, Y ). We have

and

(RAC, 1) = 1,

(RARC, 1) = (RA, RC) = X

FPdim(X)2 = FPdim(D).

X∈Irr(D)

So λ = FPdim(D), and RARC = FPdim(D)RAC. Taking FPdim of
both sides, we get the statement.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.3. Let B be a fusion category, let A, C ⊆ B be fusion
subcategories of B, and let D := A ∩ C. We have

FPdim(B) ≥

FPdim(A)FPdim(C)

FPdim(D)

,

and we have a factorization B = AC if and only if this inequality is an
equality.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.4. A factorization B = AC of a fusion category B into
a product of two fusion subcategories A, C ⊆ B of B is called exact if
A ∩ C = Vec, and is denoted by B = A • C.
Remark 3.5. Note that since (AC)∗ = CA, if B = AC then B = CA
and if B = A • C then B = C • A.

Example 3.6. Exact factorizations C = C1 •C2, where Ci = Vec(Gi, ωi)
are arbitrary pointed fusion categories (i = 1, 2), are classiﬁed by
groups G with exact factorization G = G1G2 and ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) which
restricts to ω1 on G1 and to ω2 on G2.

Lemma 3.7. Let B be a fusion category, and let A, C ⊆ B be fusion
subcategories of B such that A ∩ C = Vec. Then for any simple objects
X ∈ A and Y ∈ C, X ⊗ Y is simple in B and it determines X, Y .
Proof. For any simple objects X ′ ∈ A and Y ′ ∈ C, we have
Hom(X ⊗ Y, X ′ ⊗ Y ′) = Hom(X ′∗ ⊗ X, Y ′ ⊗ Y ∗).

Note that X ′∗ ⊗ X ∈ A and Y ′ ⊗ Y ∗ ∈ C. So if the unit object 1 is not
contained in both X ′∗⊗X and Y ′⊗Y ∗, then Hom(X ′∗⊗X, Y ′⊗Y ∗) = 0.

EXACT FACTORIZATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF FUSION CATEGORIES 7

Thus Hom(X ′∗ ⊗ X, Y ′ ⊗ Y ∗) = 0 unless X = X ′ and Y = Y ′. If so,
then there is a single copy of 1 on each side, so Hom(X ′∗ ⊗ X, Y ′ ⊗ Y ∗)
is 1-dimensional. Thus X ⊗ Y is simple, and it determines X, Y , as
claimed.
(cid:3)

Theorem 3.8. Let B be a fusion category, and let A, C ⊆ B be fusion
subcategories of B. The following are equivalent:

(i) Every simple object of B can be uniquely expressed in the form

X ⊗ Y , where X ∈ A and Y ∈ C are simple objects.

(ii) B = A • C is an exact factorization in the sense of Deﬁnition

3.4.

Proof. Suppose that (i) holds. Clearly, A ∩ C = Vec, so by Lemma 3.7,
for any simple objects X ∈ A and Y ∈ C, X ⊗ Y is simple in B. We
therefore have,
FPdim(B) = X

FPdim(X ⊗ Y )2 = FPdim(A)FPdim(C),

X∈Irr(A), Y ∈Irr(C)

so by Corollary 3.3, (ii) holds.

Conversely, suppose that (ii) holds. Then by Lemma 3.7, for any
simple objects X ∈ A and Y ∈ C, X⊗Y is simple in B and it determines
X, Y . Thus,

X

X∈Irr(A), Y ∈Irr(C)

FPdim(X ⊗ Y )2 = FPdim(A)FPdim(C) = FPdim(B),

and we see that (i) holds.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.9. Suppose B is a braided fusion category with an exact
factorization B = A • C. Then B = A ⊠ C is a Deligne tensor product,
and A and C projectively centralize each other in the sense of [EGNO,
Section 8.22].

∼=−→ B, X ⊠ Y 7→ X ⊗ Y , has a tensor
Proof. The equivalence F : A ⊠ C
structure J deﬁned by the braiding structure c on B. Namely, for every
X, X ′ ∈ A and Y, Y ′ ∈ C,

JX⊠Y,X ′⊠Y ′ : F ((X ⊠ Y ) ⊗ (X ′ ⊠ Y ′))

∼=−→ F (X ⊠ Y ) ⊗ F (X ′ ⊠ Y ′)

is the map

id ⊗ cX ′,Y ⊗ id : (X ⊗ X ′) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Y ′)

∼=−→ (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ (X ′ ⊗ Y ′).

It is straightforward to verify that since c satisﬁes the braiding axioms,
J satisﬁes the tensor functor axioms.

Furthermore, for every simple objects X ∈ A and Y ∈ C,

cY,X ◦ cX,Y : X ⊗ Y

∼=−→ X ⊗ Y

8

SHLOMO GELAKI

is an automorphism of the simple object X ⊗ Y in B. We therefore get
that cY,X ◦ cX,Y = λ · idX⊗Y for some λ ∈ k×, as claimed.
(cid:3)

We conclude this section with a couple of natural questions about

the new notion of exact factorization of fusion categories.

Question 3.10. (i) Let A, C be fusion categories. What are the fusion
categories B admitting an exact factorization B = A • C?

(ii) What can be said about the center Z(B) of a fusion category B

with an exact factorization B = A • C?

4. Extensions of fusion categories

Retain the notation from Subsection 2.2.
We are now ready to state and prove our main result, in which we
relate exact factorizations of fusion categories with exact sequences of
fusion categories.

Theorem 4.1. The following hold:

(i) Let

A ι−→ B F−→ C ⊠ End(N )

be an exact sequence of fusion categories with respect to the indecom-
posable A-module category N . Then the dual fusion category B∗
admits an exact factorization B∗

C⊠N = C • A∗

N .

C⊠N

(ii) Any exact factorization B = C • A of fusion categories deﬁnes an
exact sequence of fusion categories with respect to any indecomposable
A-module category N . In particular, it deﬁnes an exact sequence

A ι−→ B F−→ C ⊠ End(A)

with respect to the indecomposable A-module category A.

Proof. (i) Choose a nonzero object N ∈ N , and consider the algebra
object A := EndA(N) in A. Then A is an algebra in B.

Let M := ModB(A) be the category of right A−modules in B, and
consider M as a left module category over B in the usual way. By [EG,
Theorem 3.6], M and C ⊠ N are equivalent as B−module categories.
M can be identiﬁed with the fusion category BimodB(A), we
M contains BimodA(A) = A∗

N as a fusion subcategory.

Since B∗
see that B∗

Also, by taking the dual of B F−→ C ⊠ End(N ) with respect to the
M contains C as a fusion

module category M = C ⊠ N , we get that B∗
subcategory.

Furthermore, by assumption, every object from A∗

N is sent to End(N )
under F , while every non-trivial object of C is not. This means that
A∗

Since by [EG, Theorem 3.4],

FPdim(A)FPdim(C) = FPdim(B) = FPdim(B∗

M),

we conclude from Theorem 3.8 that B∗

M = A∗

N • C is an exact factor-

(ii) Let N be an indecomposable A-module category, and let A be
an algebra in A such that N = ModA(A). Since A is an algebra in
B, we may consider the B−module category M := ModB(A) of right
A−modules in B. Observe that since M = B ⊠A N = (C • A) ⊠A N ,
M = C ⊠ N as a right C-module category.

Now, let ¯A := A∗

N , ¯B := B∗

M be the dual fusion categories of A, B

with respect to N , M, respectively. Then we have a sequence

¯A ι−→ ¯B F−→ C ⊠ End(N ).

Since FPdim( ¯A)FPdim(C) = FPdim( ¯B), and ¯A is in the kernel of F , it
follows from [EG, Theorem 3.4] that this sequence of fusion categories
is exact with respect to the indecomposable A-module category N , as
desired.

The proof of the theorem is complete.

(cid:3)

We can now deduce from Theorem 4.1 and (4) that any extension of
a group-theoretical fusion category by another one is Morita equivalent
to a fusion category with an exact factorization into a product of two
group-theoretical fusion subcategories.

Retain the notation from Subsection 2.3.

Corollary 4.2. Let C(G1, ω1, L1, ψ1) and C(G2, ω2, L2, ψ2) be two group-
theoretical fusion categories, and let M = M(L3, ψ3) be an indecom-
posable module category over C(G1, ω1, L1, ψ1). Suppose

C(G1, ω1, L1, ψ1) ι−→ B F−→ C(G2, ω2, L2, ψ2) ⊠ End(M)

is an exact sequence with respect to M. Then the dual fusion category
B∗

C(G2,ω2,L2,ψ2)⊠M admits an exact factorization

B∗

C(G2,ω2,L2,ψ2)⊠M = C(G1, ω1, L3, ψ3) • C(G2, ω2, L2, ψ2)

into a product of two group-theoretical fusion subcategories.

(cid:3)

Example 4.3. Let G1, G2 be ﬁnite groups.

(i) Let M = M(L3, ψ3) be an indecomposable module category over

Rep(G1), and suppose

Rep(G1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2, ω2) ⊠ End(M)

is an exact sequence with respect to M. Then the dual fusion category
B∗

Vec(G2,ω2)⊠M admits an exact factorization

B∗

Vec(G2,ω2)⊠M = C(G1, 1, L3, ψ3) • Vec(G2, ω2).

(ii) Let M = M(L3, ψ3) be an indecomposable module category over

Vec(G1, ω1), and suppose

Vec(G1, ω1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2, ω2) ⊠ End(M)

is an exact sequence with respect to M. Then the dual fusion category
B∗

Vec(G2,ω2)⊠M admits an exact factorization

B∗

Vec(G2,ω2)⊠M = C(G1, ω1, L3, ψ3) • Vec(G2, ω2).

Corollary 4.4. Let G1, G2 be ﬁnite groups.

(i) Suppose

Rep(G1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2, ω2)

is an exact sequence with respect to M(1, 1) (= the standard ﬁber func-
tor on Rep(G1)). Then

B = Vec(G, ω)∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = C(G, ω, G1, 1)

for some ﬁnite group G with an exact factorization G = G1G2, and a
3-cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that is trivial on G1 and restricts to ω2 on
G2.

(ii) Suppose

Vec(G1, ω1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2, ω2) ⊠ End( ˜M(1, 1))

is an exact sequence with respect to ˜M(1, 1). Then

B = Vec(G, ω)∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = C(G, ω, G1, 1)

for some ﬁnite group G with an exact factorization G = G1G2 and a
3-cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that restricts to ω1 on G1 and to ω2 on G2.

EXACT FACTORIZATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF FUSION CATEGORIES 11

Proof. (i) By specializing Example 4.3 (i) to M = M(1, 1) we get that

B∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = Vec(G1) • Vec(G2, ω2).

Since Vec(G1)• Vec(G2, ω2) is pointed, it is equal to Vec(G, ω) for some
ﬁnite group G with an exact factorization G = G1G2, and a 3-cocycle
ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that is trivial on G1 and restricts to ω2 on G2. Thus,

B = Vec(G, ω)∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = C(G, ω, G1, 1),

as claimed.

(ii) By specializing Example 4.3 (ii) to M = ˜M(1, 1) we get that

B∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = Vec(G1, ω1) • Vec(G2, ω2).

Since Vec(G1, ω1) • Vec(G2, ω2) is pointed, it is equal to Vec(G, ω) for
some ﬁnite group G with an exact factorization G = G1G2, and a 3-
cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that restricts to ω1 on G1 and to ω2 on G2.
Thus,

B = Vec(G, ω)∗

Vec(G2,ω2) = C(G, ω, G1, 1),

as claimed.

(cid:3)

Example 4.5. Let B be a Kac (semisimple) Hopf algebra associated
with an exact factorization G = G1G2 of ﬁnite groups (see e.g., [K],
[M], [Na]). Then B ﬁts into an exact sequence of semisimple Hopf
algebras

Fun(G2) → B → k[G1].
Let B := Rep(B). We have an exact sequence

Rep(G1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2)

with respect to the standard ﬁber functor on Rep(G1). By Corollary
4.4 (i), B = C(G, ω, G1, 1) for some 3-cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that is
trivial on G1 and G2 (but not necessarily on G). Thus every Kac Hopf
algebra is group-theoretical. (This result was proved by Natale [Na].)
Conversely, Corollary 4.4 (i) says that if B ﬁts into an exact sequence

Rep(G1) ι−→ B F−→ Vec(G2, ω2)

of fusion categories (with respect to the standard ﬁber functor on
Rep(G1)), then B = C(G, ω, G1, 1) for some ﬁnite group G with an
exact factorization G = G1G2, and a 3-cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×) that is
trivial on G1 and restricts to ω2 on G2. Thus B is the representation
category of a semisimple group-theoretical quasi-Hopf algebra (which
may be referred to as the Kac quasi-Hopf algebra corresponding to the
exact factorization G = G1G2 and the 3−cocycle ω ∈ H 3(G, k×), see
e.g., [S]).

Example 4.6. Let B = CG be a G-equivariantization of a fusion cate-
gory C. We have an exact sequence

Rep(G) ι−→ B F−→ C

with respect to the standard ﬁber functor on Rep(G) (see e.g., [EG,
Example 4.4]). Thus, B∗
C = Vec(G)•C.
In [EGNO, Example 7.12.25] it is explained that Vec(G)•C in this case
is the semidirect product discussed in that example.

C admits an exact factorization B∗

Example 4.7. In Theorem 4.3 one does not always get a group-
theoretical fusion category. In particular, an exact factorization with
two group-theoretical factors is not always group-theoretical (even when
one of the factors is pointed).

For example, consider Nikshych’s example of the representation cate-
gory B of a non group-theoretical semisimple Hopf algebra of dimension
4p2. By [Ni, Corollary 4.6], B = C Z/2Z is a Z/2Z-equivariantization of
a group-theoretical fusion category C. So we have an exact sequence

Rep(Z/2Z) ι−→ B F−→ C

with respect to the standard ﬁber functor on Rep(Z/2Z). Hence the
resulting exact factorization fusion category Vec(Z/2Z)•C is not group-
theoretical.

Question 4.8. If B = A • C and A, C are weakly group-theoretical
fusion categories, is it true that B is weakly group-theoretical? (See
[ENO2] for the deﬁnition of a weakly group-theoretical fusion cate-
gory.) By Theorem 4.1, this question is equivalent to the question if
an extension of a weakly group-theoretical fusion category by another
one is weakly group-theoretical. (Example 4.7 shows that the answer
is “no” for group-theoretical fusion categories.)
