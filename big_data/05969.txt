CIRCUITS AND HURWITZ ACTION IN FINITE ROOT SYSTEMS

JOEL BREWSTER LEWIS AND VICTOR REINER

Abstract. In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, two factorizations of a Coxeter element into an arbitrary number
of reﬂections are shown to lie in the same orbit under the Hurwitz action if and only if they use the same
multiset of conjugacy classes. The proof makes use of a surprising lemma, derived from a classiﬁcation of
the minimal linear dependences (matroid circuits) in ﬁnite root systems: any set of roots forming a minimal
linear dependence with positive coeﬃcients has a disconnected graph of pairwise acuteness.

1. Introduction

Given a group W and set T of generators for W , consider factorizations (t1, t2, . . . , tm) of a given element
g = t1 ··· tm in W . When T is closed under conjugation, these factorizations carry a natural action of the
Artin braid group on m strands called the Hurwitz action. Here the braid group generator σi acts on ordered
factorizations by a Hurwitz move, interchanging two factors ti, ti+1 while conjugating one by the other:

(We use the notation ab := b−1ab for conjugation in a group.) When W is a ﬁnite real reﬂection group of
rank n and T is the set of all of its reﬂections, D. Bessis used a simple inductive argument to prove the
following result about shortest factorizations of Coxeter elements (see Section 5 for the deﬁnition), which he
called the dual Matsumoto property.

Bessis’s Theorem ([Bes03, Prop. 1.6.1]). Let W be a ﬁnite real reﬂection group of rank n and let c be a
Coxeter element of W . The set of all shortest ordered factorizations (t1, . . . , tn) of c = t1t2 ··· tn as a product
of reﬂections forms a single transitive orbit under the Hurwitz action.

The original context for this result is the dual Coxeter theory developed by Bessis [Bes03] and Brady and

Watt [Bra01, BW02]. It has since been extended to several other contexts:

have a single Hurwitz orbit [BGRW15].

primitivity means having at most one nonreﬂection factor,

• shortest reﬂection factorizations in well-generated complex reﬂection groups [Bes15, Prop. 7.6],
• shortest primitive factorizations in well-generated complex reﬂection groups [Rip10, Thm. 0.4], where
• shortest reﬂection factorizations in not-necessarily-ﬁnite Coxeter groups [BDSW14], and
• the classiﬁcation in ﬁnite real reﬂection groups of the elements whose shortest reﬂection factorizations
However, the question of how Bessis’s Theorem extends to longer reﬂection factorizations seems not to
have been addressed. One obstruction to transitivity has been noted frequently [LZ04, LRS14, Rip10]:
the Hurwitz action preserves the (unordered) m-element multiset of conjugacy classes of the factors. This
multiset is called the unordered passport in type A by Lando and Zvonkin [LZ04, §5.4.2.2]. In considering
reﬂection factorizations of a Coxeter element c whose length is strictly greater than the minimum (the rank
n of W ), it is possible for the factorizations to use diﬀerent multisets of reﬂection conjugacy classes. When
W is a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, we show that this is the only obstruction.

Theorem 1.1. In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, two reﬂection factorizations of a Coxeter element lie in the
same Hurwitz orbit if and only if they share the same multiset of conjugacy classes.

In particular, in the irreducible “oddly-laced types” (An, Dn, E6, E7, E8, H3, H4, and I2(m) with m odd),
there is only one conjugacy class of reﬂections, and hence the Hurwitz action is transitive.

We sketch here the proof of Theorem 1.1, which has three main steps. The ﬁrst is a lemma, proven in
Section 3, that one might paraphrase as asserting that “root circuits are acutely disconnected”. Call a subset
C = {α1, . . . , αm} of a Euclidean space (V,h·,·i) a minimal dependence (or circuit) if there exist nonzero
coeﬃcients ci such that Pm
i=1 ciαi = 0, and C is inclusion-minimal with respect to this property. Deﬁne its
acuteness graph ΓC to have vertices {1, 2, . . . , m} and an edge {i, j} whenever hciαi, cjαji > 0.
Lemma 1.2. In a ﬁnite not-necessarily-crystallographic root system, every circuit C has ΓC disconnected.

The second step (Section 4) uses Lemma 1.2 to prove a lemma on the absolute (reﬂection) length function

ℓT (w) := min{ℓ : w = t1t2 ··· tℓ for some ti ∈ T}.

Lemma 1.3. For any reﬂection factorization t = (t1, . . . , tm) of w = t1 ··· tm with ℓT (w) < m, either
m = 2, or there exists t′ = (t′
k) < k for some k ≤ m − 1.
The third step, also in Section 4, iterates Lemma 1.3 to put reﬂection factorizations into a standard form.

m) in the Hurwitz orbit of t with ℓT (t′

1 ··· t′

1, . . . , t′

Corollary 1.4. If ℓT (w) = ℓ, then every factorization of w into m reﬂections lies in the Hurwitz orbit of
some t = (t1, . . . , tm) such that

t1 = t2,
t3 = t4,
...

tm−ℓ−1 = tm−ℓ,

and (tm−ℓ+1, . . . , tm) is a shortest reﬂection factorization of w.

Section 5 then ﬁnishes oﬀ the proof of Theorem 1.1, using the case of Corollary 1.4 where w is a Coxeter
element c, along with Bessis’s Theorem above, and Bessis’s observation that any reﬂection t can occur ﬁrst
in a shortest factorization of c. Section 6 collects a few remarks and questions suggested by this work.

We note that the proof of the crucial Lemma 1.2 is case-based and relies on large computer calculations.
The remaining steps of the argument are case-independent (at least in the crystallographic case), so that one
might hope to make the argument fully human-comprehensible by giving a case-free proof of Lemma 1.2.

2. Background and terminology

In this section, we review some standard deﬁnitions and facts about ﬁnite real reﬂection groups and root

systems. Good references for this material are [BB05, Chs. 1, 4], [Hum90], and [Arm09, §§2.1–2.2].
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (V,h·,·i) be a ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, a real vector space V ∼= Rn
with a positive deﬁnite symmetric bilinear from h·,·i, whose associated norm |v| is given by |v|2 = hv, vi. For
a vector α in V , the reﬂection sα through the hyperplane H = α⊥ is the linear map given by the formula

(2.1)

sα(v) = v −

2hv, αi
|α|2 α.

A ﬁnite reﬂection group is a ﬁnite subgroup W of GLn(R) generated by its subset T ⊂ W of reﬂections.

Since reﬂections lie within the orthogonal group On(R), so does W . That is, W preserves h·,·i.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A (ﬁnite, reduced, not-necessarily-crystallographic) root system associated to a ﬁnite reﬂec-
tion group W is any W -stable subset Φ ⊂ V consisting of a choice of two opposite normal vectors ±α for
each reﬂecting hyperplane H of a reﬂection t in T . We will assume W has no ﬁxed vector in V , that is, the
w-ﬁxed spaces deﬁned by V w := {v ∈ V : w(v) = v} satisfy Tw∈W V w = {0}.

It is not hard to see that root systems Φ for W are parametrized by picking a representative t of each
conjugacy class of reﬂection and choosing a scaling for the normal vectors ±α to the reﬂecting hyperplane
of t. On the other hand, one can axiomatize such root systems as follows: they are the collections of ﬁnitely
many nonzero vectors Φ ⊂ V with the property that sα(β) ∈ Φ for all α, β ∈ V , and Φ ∩ Rα = {±α} for all
α in Φ. In this case, one recovers W as the group generated by the reﬂections {sα : α ∈ Φ}.
Deﬁnition 2.3. An open Weyl chamber F for a ﬁnite reﬂection group W is a connected component of the
complement within V of the union of the reﬂecting hyperplanes for all reﬂections t in T .

It turns out that W acts simply transitively on the set of Weyl chambers. Also, the closure F of any Weyl
chamber F is a fundamental domain for the action of W on V : every W -orbit W v on V has |(W v)∩ F| = 1.
Deﬁnition 2.4. The set Φ+ of positive roots corresponding to a choice of an open Weyl chamber F is

The associated set of simple roots Π ⊂ Φ+ is the set of inward-pointing normal vectors to the walls of F .

Φ+ := {α ∈ Φ : hα, vi > 0 for all v in F}.

It is easily seen that Φ = Φ+ ⊔ (−Φ+). Less obvious are the following properties of the simple roots

Π = {α1, . . . , αn}:

• they are pairwise non-acute,
• they form an R-basis for V ,
• they contain W -orbit representatives for all of the roots, and
• every α ∈ Φ+ has its unique expression α = Pn

i=1 ciαi with ci ≥ 0 for all i.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A ﬁnite reﬂection group W is called reducible if there exists a nontrivial orthogonal direct
sum decomposition V = V1 ⊕ V2 respected by W .
Reducibility of the group W is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial decomposition Φ = Φ1 ⊔ Φ2 with
hα1, α2i = 0 when αi ∈ Φi for i = 1, 2, in any (or every) root system Φ for W . It is also equivalent to the
existence of a nontrivial decomposition Π = Π1 ⊔ Π2 with hα1, α2i = 0 when αi ∈ Πi for i = 1, 2, in any (or
every) choice of simple roots Π for Φ. In this situation, W = W1 × W2 where Wi is the subgroup generated
by {sα : α ∈ Φi}, or by {sα : α ∈ Πi}.
There is a classiﬁcation of ﬁnite irreducible reﬂection groups W . It contains four inﬁnite families and six
exceptional groups:

• type An−1 for n ≥ 2, where W is isomorphic to the symmetric group on n letters,
• type Bn/Cn for n ≥ 2, where W is the hyperoctahedral group of n× n signed permutation matrices,
• type Dn for n ≥ 4, where W is an index two subgroup of the hyperoctahedral group,
• type I2(m) for m ≥ 3, where W is the dihedral group of symmetries of a regular m-gon, and
• exceptional types E6, E7, E8, F4, H3, H4.

We will later need to consider the ﬁeld extension K of Q that adjoins to Q the elements hβ,αi
|α|2

for all α, β

in Φ. If we normalize all of the roots to the same length, then hβ,αi
m. This number is always algebraic, so we may assume that K is a number ﬁeld, that is, a ﬁnite extension
of Q. We can sometimes do better.

m(cid:1) if the rotation sαsβ has order

|α|2 = cos(cid:0) 2π

Deﬁnition 2.6. Say a root system Φ is crystallographic if

(2.2)

2hβ, αi
|α|2 ∈ Z for all α, β ∈ Φ.

Of course, if Φ is crystallographic, then K = Q. Since rescaling roots within a W -orbit does not aﬀect W
itself (or any of the circuit properties to be discussed later), we always choose without further mention a
crystallographic root system Φ for W when one is available. This means that Φ will be chosen crystallographic

in all types except H3, H4 (where one can take K = Q[√5]), and I2(m) for m 6∈ {3, 4, 6}.

3. Circuit classification and proof of Lemma 1.2

The goal of this section is to prove Lemma 1.2 from the Introduction, which we recall here. Fix a ﬁnite

(not-necessarily-crystallographic) root system Φ in a Euclidean space (V,h·,·i).

Deﬁnition 3.1. A ﬁnite subset C = {α1, . . . , αm} ⊆ V is a circuit if it has a nontrivial dependence
c1α1 + ··· + cmαm = 0, but no proper subset of C is dependent. Given a circuit C, the dependence
coeﬃcients (c1, . . . , cm) ∈ Rm are uniquely determined up to simultaneous R-scaling. Thus, one may deﬁne
the acuteness graph ΓC to have vertex set {1, 2, . . . , m} and an edge {i, j} whenever hciαi, cjαji > 0.

Lemma 1.2. In a ﬁnite root system, every circuit C has disconnected acuteness graph ΓC .

We will often abuse terminology by considering two circuits C, C′ to be the same when they span the same
set of lines {Rα}α∈C = {Rα′}α′∈C ′, or have the same set of normal hyperplanes {α⊥}α∈C = {(α′)⊥}α′∈C ′.
Note that in this case, ΓC = ΓC ′. In fact, our ﬁgures below will depict slightly more graphical information
about the circuits C, namely an acuteness-obtuseness graph that shows the ciαi labeling vertices, and these
solid (acute) and dotted (obtuse) edges:

ciαi

ciαi

ciαi

cjαj

when hciαi, cjαji > 0,
when hciαi, cjαji < 0,
when hciαi, cjαji = 0.




The acuteness graph ΓC comes from erasing the dotted (obtuse) edges in the acuteness-obtuseness graph.

Our proof of Lemma 1.2 relies on a classiﬁcation of circuits in ﬁnite root systems, which may be of inde-
pendent interest. Such a classﬁcation is essentially already provided in the classical types An−1, Bn/Cn, Dn
by Zaslavsky’s theory of signed graphs [Zas82], and we rely on a computer calculation for the exceptional
types.

Remark 3.2. A diﬀerent sort of circuit classiﬁcation in ﬁnite root systems was undertaken by Stembridge
[Ste07], who deﬁned the notion of an irreducible circuit. Say that a circuit C = {α} ∪ I ⊂ Φ is irreducible if
α is in the positive linear span of I, and no proper subset of I has any elements of Φ r I in its positive linear
span. Stembridge gave a classiﬁcation, up to isometry, of the irreducible circuits in all ﬁnite root systems.
Unfortunately, we did not see how to check Lemma 1.2 directly from the classiﬁcation of irreducible circuits.
See also Example 3.9 below.

Given a ﬁnite reﬂection group W and a choice of a root system ΦW in V ∼= Rn for W , one might attempt
to classify all of the circuits C ⊂ ΦW up to the action of W , that is, regarding w(C) and C equivalent for
all w in W . We will do slightly less, taking advantage of the following reduction.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Call a circuit C ⊂ ΦW a full circuit if {sα : α ∈ C} generates the group W .

Non-full circuits C ⊂ ΦW lie in a root system ΦW ′ for some proper subgroup W ′ of W , and hence can be
dealt with by induction. Thus we will only classify the full circuits in ΦW up to the W -action.1 Along the
way, we will check that Lemma 1.2 holds in each case.

One further reduction to note is that only irreducible root systems ΦW contain full circuits C: if one has
V = V1 ⊕ V2 with Φ = Φ1 ⊔ Φ2 and W = W1 × W2 then the circuit C ⊂ Φ being inclusion-minimal forces
C ⊂ Φi for either i = 1 or 2, and hence {sα : α ∈ C} ⊂ Wi for either i = 1 or 2. Thus we only need to
consider the irreducible ﬁnite root systems.

3.1. Rank 1. Here C = Φ = {±α}, whose acuteness-obtuseness graph has two vertices and a dotted edge:

+α o

3.2. Rank 2: the dihedral types I2(m). A full circuit C = {α1, α2, α3} satisﬁes c1α1 + c2α2 + c3α3 = 0
for some scalars ci. Taking the inner product of both sides of this equation with ciαi and noting that
hciαi, ciαii > 0, one concludes that at most one of the other two inner products hciαi, cjαji,hciαi, ckαki
where {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} can be positive. Hence each vertex i = 1, 2, 3 is incident to at most one edge in the

Although the rank 2 setting required no classiﬁcation of the W -orbits of full circuits C ⊂ ΦW , such a
classiﬁcation is not hard. Consider the unordered triple {A12, A13, A23}, where π
m Aij is the angular measure
of the sector R≥0ciαi + R≥0cjαj, so that Aij ∈ {1, 2,··· , m − 1} and A12 + A13 + A23 = 2m. One checks
that C is a full circuit in ΦW if and only if g := gcd{A12, A13, A23} = 1; otherwise C is full inside a sub-
root system of type I2(m′) with m′ := m
g . Furthermore, if m is odd, the unordered triple {A12, A13, A23}
completely determines the W -orbit of C, while for even m, there are exactly two W -orbits corresponding to
each such triple, represented by circuits that diﬀer from each other by a π

m rotation.

Remark 3.4. The rank 2 case raises a reasonable question: does the conclusion of Lemma 1.2 have anything
at all to do with root systems? In other words, is it possible that any minimal linearly dependent set of
vectors C = {α1, . . . , αm} in a Euclidean space V has disconnected acuteness graph ΓC ? Unfortunately,
this is not true for dim(V ) ≥ 3. A result of Fiedler [Fie05, Thm. 2.5], stated in terms of of the Gram
matrix (hαi, αji)i,j=1,...,m, asserts that C will have its obtuseness graph connected, and that one can in fact,
ﬁnd a circuit C with any prescribed set of obtuse pairs, orthogonal pairs, and acute pairs, as long as the
obtuse pairs form a connected graph. When dim(V ) ≥ 3, this means one can have both the obtuseness and
acuteness graphs being connected. For example, one has a circuit α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = 0 with the following
four vectors (αi)4

i=1 in R3, having acuteness-obtuseness graph as shown:

3.3. Type An−1 for n ≥ 3. Consider Rn with its usual inner product h·,·i making the basis vectors e1, . . . , en
orthonormal. Inside the codimension-one subspace V = (e1 + ··· + en)⊥ ⊂ Rn, considered as a Euclidean
space via the restriction of h·,·i, one has the type An−1 root system

ΦAn−1 = {±(ei − ej) : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}.

The Weyl group W is the symmetric group Sn, permuting the coordinates in Rn and preserving the subspace
V . It is well-known and easily checked that full circuits in ΦAn−1 all lie in the W -orbit of

C = {α1 = e1 − e2, α2 = e2 − e3,

. . . , αn−1 = en−1 − en, αn = en − e1},

whose minimal dependence is α1 + ··· + αn = 0. Since hαi, αji ∈ {−1, 0} for each i 6= j, its acuteness graph
ΓC contains n vertices and no edges, and so is disconnected.
Pictorially, one may associate to a subset of ΦAn−1 a graph on vertex set {1, 2, . . . , n} in which the roots
±(ei − ej) perpendicular to the hyperplane xi = xj are associated with the edge i
j . Circuits then
correspond to graphs that are cycles, and the circuit C above for n = 4 would be depicted as the graph on
the left, with its acuteness-obtuseness graph shown to its right:

Remark 3.5. This W -orbit of full circuits C in type A where ΓC has no edges at all generalizes to an
interesting and well-known family of full circuits for each irreducible crystallographic root system Φ, which
we describe here. Choose an open fundamental chamber F for W , with corresponding choice of positive
roots Φ+ and simple roots Π. Then there will always be either one or two roots in F ∩ Φ, namely

maximizes all the coeﬃcients ci (in particular ci > 0 for each i = 1, . . . , n), and

• the highest root α0, whose unique expression α0 = Pn
• the highest short root α∗ := (α0(Φ∨))∨, where α∨ := 2α

|α|2 and α0(Φ∨) is the highest root for the dual

i=1 ciαi as a positive root simultaneously

crystallographic root system Φ∨ := {α∨ : α ∈ Φ}. (When Φ∨ = Φ, one has α0 = α∗.)

Either of the roots β = α0 or β = α∗ gives rise to a full circuit C = {−β}⊔Π ⊂ Φ whose minimal dependence
has the form −β + c1α1 + ··· cnαn = 0. The acuteness graph ΓC has no edges, since the simple roots are
pairwise non-acute and since β in F ∩ Φ means that hβ, αii ≥ 0 for all αi in Π.
3.4. Type Dn for n ≥ 3. The type Dn root system

ΦDn = {±ei ± ej : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}

has Weyl group W which is an index-two subgroup of the hyperoctahedral group S±
n of all signed permutations
ei 7→ ±ew(i). Speciﬁcally, W = W (Dn) consists of those signed permutations in which there are evenly many
indices i for which ei 7→ −ew(i).
Just as one can associate graphs whose edges correspond to pairs ±α of roots in type A, Zaslavsky’s
theory of signed graphs [Zas82] associates to each root pair ±α in ΦDn (or reﬂecting hyperplane xi = ±xj)
an edge {i, j} on vertex set {1, 2, . . . , n} with a ± label:

• the roots α = ±(ei − ej) with α⊥ deﬁned by xi = +xj give rise to plus edges i
• the roots α = ±(ei + ej) with α⊥ deﬁned by xi = −xj give rise to minus edges i

+

j , and

Call a cycle in a signed graph balanced if it has an even number of minus edges, and unbalanced otherwise.

Proposition 3.6 (Zaslavsky [Zas82, Thm. 5.1(e)]). A set of roots in a root system of classical type is a
circuit if and only if its associated signed graph is one of the following types:

(i) a balanced cycle,
(ii) two edge-disjoint unbalanced cycles, having either a path joining a vertex of one cycle to a vertex of the

other, or else sharing exactly one vertex.

The circuits of type (ii) in Proposition 3.6 are exempliﬁed by the following full circuits. Given i, j ≥ 2
such that i + j ≤ n + 1, let C(n; i, j) consist of two particular unbalanced cycles of sizes i, j, connected by a
path having n + 1 − (i + j) edges:

C(n; i, j) := { e1 − e2, e2 − e3, . . . , ei−1 − ei, −e1 − ei } ∪

{ ei − ei+1, ei+1 − ei+2, . . . , ej−1 − en−j+1 } ∪

{ en−j+1 − en−j+2, en−j+2 − en−j+3, . . . , en−1 − en, en−j+1 + en }.

For example, the circuit C(12; 4, 6) ⊂ ΦD12 corresponds to this signed graph:

n on subsets of ΦDn induces an action on their signed graphs
that Zaslavsky calls switching: the permutations Sn ⊂ S±
n simply permute the vertex labels on the signed
graphs, while the sign change ei 7→ −ei swaps the two kinds of edges incident to vertex i, that is, it swaps
i
j for any j. Note that this allows one to perform these changes of edge labels in
signed graphs via the switching ei 7→ −ei:

• breaks into two W (Dn)-orbits if n is even and both i, j are odd.

Proof. Among the circuits described in Proposition 3.6, the balanced cycles (type (i)) are never full circuits

j , and so the group

It is easily seen that a circuit of type (ii) in Proposition 3.6, having two unbalanced cycles connected by a
path, is full in ΦDn if and only if its set of vertices covers {1, 2, . . . , n}. In this case, if its two disjoint cycles
have sizes i, j with i ≤ j, then we claim it is in the S±
n -orbit of C(n; i, j). To see this, perform the following
sequence of switchings:

• First, apply switches as in (3.1) to push all of the minus edges oﬀ of the path in the middle, and
• Then, in each cycle, similarly apply switches to push all of the minus edges into one consecutive

is only one minus edge left and it touches the vertex of degree three or more.

We next analyze the W -orbit structure where W := W (Dn). Since [S±

n -orbit is either
n -orbit remains a single
n r W with w(C) = C. Note that any
n that sends ei 7→ −ei for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and when n is odd, w
n -orbits split when n is odd. Also, if i is even, then the circuit C(n; i, j) is ﬁxed
). Thus the
n -orbit of C(n; i, j) does not split when i is even. A similar argument shows that it does not split when j

It only remains to show that the S±

n -orbit of C(n; i, j) does split into two W -orbits when n is even but
i, j are both odd. To do this, we describe a Z/2Z-valued W -invariant π(C) of these circuits C. Consider the
unique perfect matching M of the undirected graph for C. For example, M is shown here as the doubled

Deﬁne π(C) to be the parity of the number of minus edges in the signed graph for C that lie in M . Applying
elements of Sn to C does not aﬀect π(C), but switches of the form ek 7→ −ek reverse π(C). Thus both values
π(C) in Z/2Z occur within the S±

n -orbit of C(n; i, j), while only one value occurs in each W -orbit.

(cid:3)

Note that Proposition 3.7 immediately implies that full circuits C ⊂ ΦDn have disconnected acuteness

graph ΓC , since ΓC(n;i,j) has at least four vertices but at most two edges.

3.5. Type Bn/Cn for n ≥ 3. Since we are only concerned with the hyperplanes and reﬂections associated
to the roots, we are free to choose the crystallographic root system of type Cn:

ΦCn := {±ei ± ej : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ⊔ {±2ei : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

Here W = W (Cn) = S±

n is the full hyperoctahedral group of n × n signed permutations ei 7→ ±ew(i).

As in type D, Zaslavsky [Zas82] associates a signed graph to each subset of roots. Roots in ΦDn correspond
to (signed) edges as before, and the pair ±2ei is depicted as a self-loop on vertex i, with a minus sign. Such
a self-loop is considered an unbalanced cycle (with one edge). Then Proposition 3.6 remains correct as a
characterization of circuits C ⊂ ΦCn , that is, they are either of type (i) or (ii) mentioned there, allowing for
self-loops as unbalanced cycles.

We thus extend the deﬁnition of the circuits C(n; i, j) to allow C(n; 1, j) where 1 ≤ j ≤ n:
C(n; 1, j) := { −2e1 } ∪ { e1 − e2, e2 − e3, . . . , en−j − en−j+1 } ∪

{ en−j+1 − en−j+2, en−j+2 − en−j+3, . . . , en−1 − en en−j+1 + en}.

The following example depicts C(9; 1, 6) as a signed graph, as well as its acuteness-obtuseness graph:

Proposition 3.8. The set {C(n; 1, j) : 1 ≤ j ≤ n} is a system of representatives for the S±
circuits in ΦCn .

n -orbits of full

Proof. As before, among the circuits described in Proposition 3.6, those of type (i) (balanced cycles) are
never full circuits. But now a circuit of type (ii), having two unbalanced cycles connected by a path, is full
if and only if its set of vertices covers {1, 2, . . . , n} and also one of its balanced cycles has size one, i.e., is a
self-loop. In this case, if its two disjoint cycles have sizes 1, j, then we claim it is in the S±
n -orbit of C(n; 1, j).
To see this, perform switchings as in type D that push all of the minus edges oﬀ of the path in the middle
and into the unbalanced cycle of size j, then toward one end of this cycle, and cancel them in pairs until
only one is left; the result can then be relabeled by an element of Sn to give C(n; 1, j).
(cid:3)

Note that Proposition 3.8 immediately implies that full circuits C ⊂ ΦCn have disconnected acuteness

graph ΓC , since ΓC(n;1,j) has at least three vertices but at most one edge.

3.6. Exceptional types. We outline our Mathematica computations verifying Lemma 1.2 in the exceptional
types H3, H4, F4, E6, E7, and E8. This data is attached as auxilliary data ﬁles named in a logical way;
e.g., data for type E8 is in the ﬁle E8.txt. We ﬁrst generated a set of W -orbit representatives for all bases
of positive roots in each root system ΦW . Given the list of W -orbit representatives for bases B ⊂ Φ+
W , we
produced the W -orbit representatives for all circuits C by adding to each B a positive root α ∈ Φ+
W r B
in all possible ways, ﬁnding the unique circuit C ⊂ B ∪ {α}, and classifying all such C up to W -action.
Non-full circuits were discarded. Finally, for each of these full circuits C, we computed the acuteness graph
ΓC and veriﬁed that it was disconnected.

The table below shows the number of orbits of bases and of full circuits in each of the exceptional types.

In the case of E8, this computation required several days to produce the 1943 W -orbits of bases in Φ+
. To
E8
corroborate this data, we also produced the sizes of the stabilizers of each W -orbit representative B; these
allowed us to compare with the calculations of De Concini–Procesi [DCP08], who found (e.g.) that there are
348607121625 total bases in Φ+

.

Example 3.9. Some of the full circuits that we encountered are the irreducible circuits C = {α} ∪ I,
discussed in Remark 3.2 above. Stembridge shows that what he calls the apex vector α has hα, βi > 0 for
each β in I, if the irreducible circuit C comes from a dependence of the form (−1)α +Pβ∈I cββ = 0 with
cβ > 0. Therefore α always gives rise to a vertex of ΓC having an obtuse edge to every other vertex in
the acuteness-obtuseness graph, and so becomes an isolated vertex of the acuteness graph ΓC . We depict
here the acuteness-obtuseness graphs for the irreducible circuits in type E6, E7, E8, adapted from his ﬁgure
[Ste07, Fig. 1], where the apex α always appears in the center:

Example 3.10. In most cases it is extremely easy to recognize the disconnectedness of ΓC : either it has
an isolated vertex, or it has v vertices and fewer than v − 1 edges, or both. For example, in Stembridge’s
irreducible circuits C = {α} ∪ I, the apex vector α necessarily gives rise to an isolated vertex of ΓC .
Meanwhile in type H4, of the 419 full-rank circuit orbit representatives, there are only 25 with at least four
edges (two each with ﬁve or six edges, 21 with four edges); of these, ten have an isolated vertex (including
all of those with more than four edges) and the other ﬁfteen consist of a disjoint triangle and edge.

Example 3.11. Here is another interesting example of an acuteness-obtuseness graph of a full circuit in E8:

4. Non-minimal factorizations, and proofs of Lemma 1.3 and Corollary 1.4

Most of this section is devoted to the proof of the following lemma from the Introduction, recalled here,

which we then use to prove Corollary 1.4.

Lemma 1.3. For any reﬂection factorization t = (t1, . . . , tm) of w = t1 ··· tm with ℓT (w) < m, either m = 2
or there exists t′ = (t′

m) in the Hurwitz orbit of t with ℓT (t′

1, . . . , t′

1 ··· t′

k) < k for some k ≤ m − 1.

An important tool will be Carter’s characterization of minimal reﬂection factorizations.

Proposition 4.1 (Carter [Car72, Lem. 3]). In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group W , one has ℓT (sα1 ··· sαk ) = k
if and only the roots α1, . . . , αk are linearly independent.

In particular, this implies that the reﬂection length function ℓT : W → N only takes values in {0, 1, . . . , dim(V )}.
A second important observation is the following.

Proposition 4.2. A subsequence (ti1 , . . . , tik ) with 1 ≤ i1 < . . . < ik ≤ m of a factorization t = (t1, . . . , tm)
of w = t1t2 ··· tm is always a preﬁx for some t′ = (ti1 , . . . , tik , t′
m) in the Hurwitz orbit of t.
Proof. Starting with t, apply σi1−1, σi1−2, . . . , σ2, σ1 to move the ti1 to the ﬁrst position; then similarly apply
σi2−1, σi2−2, . . . , σ3, σ2 to move ti2 to the second position, and so on.
(cid:3)

k+2, . . . , t′

k+1, t′

Using Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 in the context of Lemma 1.3, one can assume without loss of generality
that the reﬂection factorization t = (t1, . . . , tm) of w = t1 ··· tm with ℓT (w) < m corresponds via ti = sαi to
a sequence of roots α1, α2, . . . , αm that form a circuit C = {α1, . . . , αm} ⊂ Φ. Furthermore, as in Section 3,
one can also assume that ΦW is irreducible, and that C is a full circuit in ΦW .
Note that Lemma 1.3 can be checked trivially in rank 1, since W = hs : s2 = ei. The next subsection
deals with rank 2, and the one following deals with ranks 3 and higher, relying ultimately on Lemma 1.2.

CIRCUITS AND HURWITZ ACTION IN FINITE ROOT SYSTEMS

11

4.1. Rank 2. Lemma 1.3 is already interesting in rank 2, so that W is the dihedral group

W = Wm := hs, t : s2 = t2 = e, (st)m = ei

of type I2(m). Since full circuits C have size 3, the reductions above show that, to prove Lemma 1.3, it only
remains to check the following assertion: any reﬂection factorization t = (t1, t2, t3) of w = t1t2t3 in Wm
has a factorization of the form t′ = (t′, t′, t′′) in its Hurwitz orbit. In fact, one need only prove this same
assertion for the inﬁnite dihedral group

of type I2(∞). The reﬂections in W∞ are the elements of odd length in the generating set s, t; we denote
them by T = {t(n) := (st)ns, n ∈ Z}. (In particular, this means s = t(0) and t = t(−1).) The obvious
surjection W∞ ։ Wm

W∞ = hs, t | s2 = t2 = ei

• carries reﬂections in W∞ to reﬂections in Wm, and
• sends Hurwitz moves σi on factorizations in W∞ as in (1.1) to the same Hurwitz move in Wm.

There is a standard geometric model for W∞ as generated by aﬃne reﬂections of the real line R: the

reﬂection t(n) reﬂects R across the point x = n in R. Thus the conjugation action

t(b)t(a) = t(a) · t(b) · t(a) = t(2a − b)

corresponds to reﬂecting b across a on the line R. Therefore, bearing in mind Proposition 4.2, it will suﬃce
to show that, given an ordered triple of integers (a, b, c), one can eventually reach a triple having two of
the integers equal via moves that reﬂect one of a, b across the other and swapping their positions within the
triple, or doing the same with b, c. We give an algorithm that does this by reﬂecting one of the three values
a, b, c across the median value, proceeding by induction on the (positive integer) length

of the interval that they span, and eventually making two of them coincide.

M (a, b, c) := max{a, b, c} − min{a, b, c}

Up to the irrelevant symmetries (a, b, c) 7→ (c, b, a) and (a, b, c) 7→ (−a,−b,−c) (the latter being achieved
by reﬂection across 0), we may suppose that either a ≤ b ≤ c or a ≤ c < b. In the latter case, reﬂecting b
across a produces (2a − b, a, c) with 2a − b < a ≤ c, so we reduce to the former case. Since a ≤ b ≤ c, one
has M = c − a. Let m := min{b− a, c− b}. Without loss of generality, M (a, b, c) > m > 0, else we are done.
If m = b − a, reﬂect a across b giving (a′, b′, c′) = (b, 2a − b, c) with M (a′, b′, c′) = c − b ≤ m < M (a, b, c). If
m = c − b, reﬂect c across b giving (a′, b′, c′) = (a, 2b − c, b) with M (a′, b′, c′) = b − a ≤ m < M (a, b, c). In
either case, we are done by induction.

Here is an illustration in the case (a, b, c) = (3, 7, 5) (so that initially a < c < b):

4.2. Higher ranks. When W has rank at least three, we require a somewhat more subtle argument to prove
Lemma 1.3. Given a factorization w = t1t2 ··· tm in which ℓT (w) < m, there exists an m-tuple (α1, . . . , αm)
of roots for which ti = sαi , and by Proposition 4.1 this m-tuple is linearly dependent.
Deﬁnition 4.3. A pair (C, c) where C = (α1, . . . , αm) in Φm and c = (c1, . . . , cm) in Rm with Pm

will be called an m-dependence in Φ. Its weight is deﬁned as

i=1 ciαi = 0

wt(C, c) := wt(c) :=

m

Xi=1

|ci|.

Our proof strategy for Lemma 1.3 is to start with any nontrivial m-dependence (C, c) that accompanies
a non-minimal factorization w = t1t2 ··· tm, and try to apply Hurwitz moves that make wt(C, c) strictly
smaller. Then we work by induction to show that for m > 2, every m-dependence has in its Hurwitz orbit
an m-dependence (C′, c′) where one of the coeﬃcients c′
i vanishes, so that a proper subset of the vectors in

12

JOEL BREWSTER LEWIS AND VICTOR REINER

C is dependent. Bearing in mind Proposition 4.2, this would prove Lemma 1.3. There are at least three
separate issues here:

(i) We need a well-deﬁned Hurwitz action on the set of m-dependences (easy—see Proposition 4.4).
(ii) We need to know that some Hurwitz move applies that lowers wt(C, c). Here we use Lemma 1.2.
(iii) We need to know that one cannot lower wt(C, c) inﬁnitely often. This is a fairly easy argument in the

crystallographic case, but requires one further computation in types H3, H4.

We deal with issues (i), (ii), (iii) in the next three subsections.

4.2.1. Dealing with issue (i). We lift Hurwitz moves on reﬂection factorizations to moves on m-dependences.

Proposition 4.4. The Hurwitz move t

action of the operators σi on the set of m-dependences in Φ satisﬁes the usual braid relations, giving an
action of the m-strand braid group on the set of m-dependences.

(a) If hciαi, ci+1αi+1i = 0, then wt(σi(C, c)) = wt(σ−1

Cauchy-Schwarz then forces αi+1 = ±αi, contradicting C = (α1, . . . , αm) being a circuit with m ≥ 3.

(cid:3)

With this in hand, issue (ii) is dealt with by the following result.

Proposition 4.7. Given a nontrivial m-dependence (C, c) for m ≥ 3, with C = (α1, . . . , αm) supported on
a full circuit C = {α1, . . . , αm} ⊂ Φ, there exists another m-dependence (C′, c′) in its Hurwitz orbit such
that wt(c′) < wt(c).
Proof. As before, ci 6= 0 for all i since C is a circuit. The acuteness graph ΓC is disconnected by Lemma 1.2,
so one has a nontrivial decomposition {1, 2, . . . , m} = I ⊔ J in which ciαi, cjαj are nonacute for every
(i, j) ∈ I × J. They cannot always be orthogonal, else C would not be a circuit. Hence, there exists at least
one (i0, j0) ∈ I × J for which ci0 αi0 , cj0 αj0 are (strictly) obtuse. Assume i0 < j0 without loss of generality.
Let I = {i1 < i2 < ···} and J = {j1 < j2 < ···}, and imagine the process of sorting the sequence
(1, 2, 3, . . . , m) into the linear order (j1, j2, . . . , i1, i2, . . .) using adjacent transpositions sk (i.e., sk swaps the
entries in positions k, k + 1) so that at each step, the transposed values {i, j} satisfy (i, j) ∈ I × J. Since
this process starts with i0 left of j0 and ends with i0 right of j0, there must exist some ﬁrst step in this
process where one uses some sk0 to swap a pair (i, j) ∈ I × J having ciαi, cjαj obtuse. All of the previous
steps swap pairs of orthogonal roots, and hence lift to a corresponding sequence of Hurwitz moves σi applied
to (C, c) that only re-order the entries. The product of these moves is a (re-ordered) m-dependence (C′c′)
having wt(c′) = wt(c). However, at the next step, Lemma 4.6(c) shows that one of the two lifts σ±1
of sk0
k0
will have wt(σ±1
(cid:3)
k0

(C′, c′)) < wt(C′, c′) = wt(C, c), as desired.

4.2.3. Dealing with issue (iii). We need to know that when applying several Hurwitz moves that decrease
weight to an m-dependence (C, c) supported on an (unordered) circuit, one cannot return to the same circuit.

Proposition 4.8. Fix a circuit C in a ﬁnite root system Φ of rank at least 3, and two m-dependences
(C, c), (C′, c′) supported on C. If the two m-dependences are in the same Hurwitz orbit then wt(c′) = wt(c).

Proof. Note that the hypotheses and conclusion of the proposition are unaﬀected by rescaling c.

Let K be the ﬁnite extension of Q generated by 2hα,βi
|α|2

for all roots α, β in Φ. Every root α is in the
W -orbit of a root in Π, and hence by (2.1) in the K-subspace of V generated by Π. Thus, we may rescale
c so that it lies in K m. Clearing denominators, we can assume c lies in om, where o is the ring of integers
within K.

14

JOEL BREWSTER LEWIS AND VICTOR REINER

We further claim that one can assume both that o is a principal ideal domain, and that it contains all of
for α, β in Φ. To see this claim, note that our ﬁnite root systems Φ of rank at

the algebraic numbers 2hα,βi
|α|2
least 3 have been chosen either to be

• crystallographic, so that o = Z ⊂ Q = K, with 2hα,βi
• type H3, H4, so that o = Z(cid:2)(1 + √5)/2(cid:3) ⊂ Q[√5] = K, with 2hα,βi

in Z, or

|α|2

Therefore the ideal I = (c) of o generated by the entries of c is a principal ideal I = (g) in o, where
g := gcd(c) is uniquely deﬁned up to scaling by units in o×. The formulas (4.1), (4.3) show that the Hurwitz
moves σ±

i do not change I.

Now assume were are given (C, c), (C,′ c′) as in the hypothesis of the proposition, and permute indices of
C so that C′ = C as (ordered) circuits. The uniqueness of the dependence up to scaling forces c′ = kc for
some k ∈ K ×, and hence

|α|2 ∈ (cid:8)2 cos( 2π

5 ), 2 cos( 4π

5 )(cid:9) ⊂ o.

wt(C′, c′) = |k| · wt(C, c).

The above discusion shows that, additionally, gcd(c) = gcd(c′) in o, so that c′ = kc forces k to lie in o×.
Thus, in the crystallographic case, we are done since o× = Z× = {±1}, so |k| = 1.
In the noncrystallographic H3, H4 cases, we still need to rule out the possibility that the unit k in o×
has |k| 6= 1. This would mean that the Hurwitz orbit of the m-dependence (C, c) contains inﬁnitely many
other elements, namely those whose weights are scaled by 1,|k|,|k|2, . . . . However, we used a computer to
check that this does not happen: for every W -orbit of full circuits C in ΦH3 , ΦH4, as classiﬁed in Section 3.6,
we linearly ordered C in all ways to form C, picked coeﬃcients c (uniquely up to scaling) to create an
m-dependence (C, c), applied all Hurwitz moves σ±
to generate new dependences, then repeated with the
i
new dependences. A priori this could have run indeﬁnitely, but in fact it always terminated with a ﬁnite
list, proving the claim.
(cid:3)

1, . . . , t′

k) < k for some k ≤ m − 1.

4.2.4. Proof of Lemma 1.3 in ranks at least 3. Given a reﬂection factorization t = (t1, . . . , tm) of w = t1 ··· tm
with ℓT (w) < m and m ≥ 3, we want to show there exists t′ = (t′
m) in the Hurwitz orbit of t with
ℓT (t′

1 ··· t′
As mentioned earlier, using Propositions 4.1 and 4.2, we may assume without loss of generality that the
tuple C = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) of roots corresponding to (t1, . . . , tm) via ti = sαi is supported on a circuit
C = {α1, . . . , αm} in Φ. Furthermore, as in Section 3, one can also assume that ΦW is irreducible, and that
C is a full circuit in ΦW .
Pick coeﬃcients c that make (C, c)(=: (C(0), c(0))) an m-dependence. Then Proposition 4.7 shows that
that there exists an m-dependence (C(1), c(1)) in its Hurwitz orbit having wt(C(1), c(1)) < wt(C(0), c(0)).
Repeat this process, producing a sequence of m-dependences (C(i), c(i)) in the Hurwitz orbit of (C, c), with
strictly decreasing sequence of weights. If it ever happens that some coeﬃcient c(i)
j = 0, so that some proper
subsequence of C(i) is dependent, then we are done by Propositions 4.1 and 4.2. However, this must happen:
otherwise each C(i) is supported on a circuit C(i) ⊂ Φ, of which there are only ﬁnitely many, so C(i) = C(j)
for some i < j, contradicting Proposition 4.8.

This completes the proof of Lemma 1.3 in rank at least three, and hence in all ranks.

4.3. Proof of Corollary 1.4. Recall the statement of Corollary 1.4 from the Introduction.

Corollary 1.4. If ℓT (w) = ℓ, then every factorization of w into m reﬂections lies in the Hurwitz orbit of
some t = (t1, . . . , tm) such that

t1 = t2,
t3 = t4,
...

tm−ℓ−1 = tm−ℓ,

and (tm−ℓ+1, . . . , tm) is a shortest reﬂection factorization of w.

Proof. Induct on m, with trivial base case m = 0.
In the inductive step for m > 0, given a reﬂection
factorization w = t1t2 ··· tm, either ℓ := ℓT (w) = m, in which case we are done, or there exists some smallest

index i for which ℓT (t1t2 ··· ti) < i. By applying Lemma 1.3 repeatedly, we may assume that i = 2. This
means that t1 = t2, and we are done by applying the induction to the factorization w = t3t4 ··· tm.

(cid:3)

5. Coxeter elements and the proof of Theorem 1.1

Theorem 1.1 is a statement about factorizations of Coxeter elements. We recall their deﬁnition and a few

properties here, before proving the theorem.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Given a ﬁnite real reﬂection group W with root system Φ, one deﬁnes a Coxeter element
to be any element of W of the form c = sα1sα2 ··· sαn , where (α1, . . . , αn) is any ordering of any choice of
simple roots Π = {α1, . . . , αn} for Φ.

It turns out (see, e.g. [Hum90, §3.16]) that all Coxeter elements c lie within the same W -conjugacy class.
We mention here a few other important properties of Coxeter elements that we will use. One is Bessis’s
Theorem [Bes03, Prop. 1.6.1] from the Introduction, asserting that any two shortest reﬂection factorizations
c = t1t2 . . . tn lie in the same Hurwitz orbit. It has the following non-obvious corollary.

Corollary 5.2. In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, any two shortest reﬂection factorizations of a Coxeter
element use the same multiset of reﬂection conjugacy classes.

(Speciﬁcally, it is the multiset of conjugacy classes of the simple root reﬂections (sα)α∈Π, two of which lie
in the same W -conjugacy class if and only if they have a path of odd-labeled edges between them in the
Coxeter diagram for W ; see [BB05, Exer. 1.16].)

We will also need the following lemma used by Bessis in the proof of his theorem.

Lemma 5.3 (Bessis [Bes03, Lem. 1.4.2]). For every Coxeter element c and reﬂection t in W there exists a
shortest reﬂection factorization c = t1t2 ··· tn starting with t1 = t.

Combining Bessis’s Theorem from the Introduction with Lemma 5.3 gives the following.

Corollary 5.4. Fix a reﬂection t and a Coxeter element c. Then every shortest reﬂection factorization
c = t1t2 ··· tn lies in the Hurwitz orbit of such a factorization that starts with t.

We can now prove Theorem 1.1 from the Introduction, whose statement we recall here.

Theorem 1.1. In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, two reﬂection factorizations of a Coxeter element lie in the
same Hurwitz orbit if and only if they share the same multiset of conjugacy classes.

Proof. The “only if” statement is clear, as Hurwitz moves do not aﬀect the multiset of conjugacy classes.

For the “if” statement, given two reﬂection factorizations t = (t1, . . . , tm) and t′ = (t′

m) of c
having the same multiset of reﬂection conjugacy classes, we show that they lie in the same Hurwitz orbit via
induction on m. By Corollary 1.4, we may assume that both t, t′ consist of a sequence of (m − n)/2 pairs
of equal reﬂections, followed by shortest factorizations ˆt, ˆt′ of c:

1, . . . , t′

t = (t1, t1, t3, t3, . . . , tm−n−1, tm−n−1, ˆt),
m−n−1, ˆt′).
t′ = (t′

m−n−1, t′

3, . . . , t′

1, t′

3, t′

1, t′

It would suﬃce to show that the Hurwitz orbit of t contains a factorization that starts with (t′
one could then apply induction after restricting t, t′ to their last m − 2 positions {3, 4, . . . , m}.
To this end, we ﬁrst claim that one of the pairs (ti, ti) (in positions i, i + 1) of adjacent equal reﬂections
1; this is so because Corollary 5.2 implies ˆt, ˆt′ share the same
in t has ti in the same conjugacy class as t′
multiset of conjugacy classes, and it is a hypothesis of the theorem that t, t′ share the same multiset of
conjugacy classes.

Via a sequence of Hurwitz moves of the form σ−1

k , one can move the two copies (ti, ti) in t to the right,

stopping just before ˆt, giving an element in the Hurwitz orbit of t whose last n + 2 positions are

(ti, ti, ˆt).

Since ti is W -conjugate to t′

1, one can choose w in W and a reﬂection factorization w = r1 ··· rk such that

JOEL BREWSTER LEWIS AND VICTOR REINER

By Corollary 5.4, one can apply Hurwitz moves to ˆt and make it start with the reﬂection r1. Thus the last
n + 2 positions in the factorization now look like

Apply the Hurwitz moves of the form σk that move r1 two steps left, changing the factorization to

(ti, ti, r1, ˆˆt).

(r1, tr1

i , ˆˆt).

Then apply Hurwitz moves of the form σk that move both of (tr1

where the suﬃx (r1, ˆˆt) is still a shortest factorization of c. Repeating this process with r2, r3, . . . , rk in place
of r1 gives a factorization whose last n + 2 positions have the form

(t′

1, t′

1, ˜t)

for some shortest factorization ˜t of c. Then applying a sequence of moves of the form σk gives a factorization
in the Hurwitz orbit of t that moves (t′

1) to the ﬁrst two positions, as desired.

6. Remarks

6.1. Quasi-Coxeter elements. Baumeister, Gobet, Roberts, and Wegener [BGRW15] deﬁne a quasi-
Coxeter element c in a ﬁnite reﬂection group W to be an element having a shortest reﬂection factorization
c = t1t2 ··· tℓ for which {t1, t2, . . . , tℓ} generates W . For example, Coxeter elements as in Deﬁnition 5.1 have
this property. P. Wegener has pointed out that our proof of Theorem 1.1 generalizes to prove the following.

Theorem 6.1. In a ﬁnite real reﬂection group, two reﬂection factorizations of a quasi-Coxeter element lie
in the same Hurwitz orbit if and only if they share the same multiset of conjugacy classes.

Proof sketch. The crucial Corollary 1.4 applies to any element of W . Also, Bessis’s Theorem from the
Introduction, asserting transitivity of the Hurwitz action for shortest reﬂection factorization of Coxeter
elements, was generalized to quasi-Coxeter elements as [BGRW15, Thm. 1.1]. This implies the analogue of
Corollary 5.2, replacing the word “Coxeter element” by “quasi-Coxeter element.” It also follows from the
deﬁnition of quasi-Coxeter element and Proposition 4.2 that W is generated by the set of all reﬂections t1
that can appear ﬁrst in a shortest reﬂection factorization c = t1t2 ··· tm of a quasi-Coxeter element; this
property plays the role of Lemma 5.3. The rest of the proof of Theorem 1.1 uses only these properties. (cid:3)

In fact, the quasi-Coxeter property seems to go to the heart of Hurwitz transitivity for factorizations of
arbitrary length. For example, in a Coxeter group W having only one reﬂection conjugacy class, if one is
given a non-quasi-Coxeter element w, one can choose a reﬂection factorization w = t1t2 ··· tm such that
W ′ := ht1, . . . , tmi ( W . Then for any reﬂection t in W \ W ′, the two factorizations w = t1 ··· tm · t · t =
t1 ··· tm · t1 · t1 of length m + 2 use the same multiset of reﬂection conjugacy classes, but necessarily lie in
diﬀerent Hurwitz orbits.

6.2. Aﬃne Weyl groups. Note that the crucial Lemma 1.3 holds for the smallest case of an aﬃne Weyl
group, namely, the inﬁnite dihedral group W∞ of type I2(∞) from Section 4.1. It is also not hard to check
that Theorem 1.1 holds verbatim for this group W∞, raising the following question.

Question 6.2. Does Theorem 1.1 hold verbatim for aﬃne Weyl groups? Other non-ﬁnite Coxeter groups?

Note that there is an issue in the deﬁnition of Coxeter elements for arbitrary Coxeter systems (W, S),
since products c = s1s2 ··· sn of the elements of S in diﬀerent orders need not be W -conjugate if the Coxeter
diagram contains cycles.

6.3. Complex reﬂection groups. As mentioned in the Introduction, Bessis extended his theorem on
shortest factorizations from real reﬂection groups to well-generated complex reﬂection groups, where the
notion of Coxeter elements still makes sense; see [Bes15].
In fact, all evidence points to the following
verbatim generalization of Theorem 1.1.

Conjecture 6.3. In a well-generated ﬁnite complex reﬂection group, two reﬂection factorizations of a Cox-
eter element lie in the same Hurwitz orbit if and only if they share the same multiset of conjugacy classes.

We discuss some of the evidence for Conjecture 6.3 here. Just as with real reﬂection groups, there is a
classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite complex reﬂection groups acting irreducibly, due to Shephard and Todd. It contains
one inﬁnite family G(de, e, n) for n, d, e ≥ 1, and 34 exceptional groups. The group G(de, e, n) consists of all
n × n matrices which are monomial (that is, having exactly one nonzero entry in each row and column) and
whose nonzero entries are deth roots of unity, with their product a dth root of unity.2
Although every real reﬂection group is well-generated in the sense of having a generating set consisting of n
reﬂections, this is not true for all complex reﬂection groups W acting on Cn. For example, within the inﬁnite
family G(de, e, n), this fails when d, e, n ≥ 2; only the subfamilies G(d, 1, n), G(e, e, n) are well-generated.
The ﬁrst author has veriﬁed Conjecture 6.3 via a direct argument in G(d, 1, n). We have veriﬁed it via
computer for the factorizations c = t1t2 ··· tm with m ≤ n + 3 in the following well-generated groups acting
irreducibly on Cn: G(e, e, n) with (n, e) = (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3) and Shephard-Todd’s exceptional
types G4, G5, G6, G8.

Regarding proof techniques, one might hope that the statement of Lemma 1.3 would generalize to the
context of well-generated groups. Unfortunately, this is not the case. For example, consider the exceptional
group W of type G5, with presentation W ≡ hs, t | s3 = t3 = e, stst = tstsi. The reﬂections in W are the
conjugates of s, t, s−1 and t−1. The element w := sts−1ts = t−1 · st−1sts−1 has absolute length 2, and has
60 non-minimal factorizations as a product of three reﬂections. These 60 factorizations fall into four Hurwitz
orbits, one of which includes the factorization

One may check that all 27 factorizations (t1, t2, t3) in the Hurwitz orbit of this factorization (s, t, s−1ts)
share the property that the product t1t2 has absolute length 2, and so Lemma 1.3 does not hold. It is not
clear what might replace this lemma in a proof of Conjecture 6.3.

w = s · t · s−1ts.
