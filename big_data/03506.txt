Small systems in contact with a heat bath evolve by stochastic dynamics. Here we show that, when one such
small system is weakly coupled to another one, it is possible to infer the presence of such weak coupling by
observing the violation of the steady state ﬂuctuation theorem for the partial entropy production of the observed
system. We give a general mechanism due to which the violation of the ﬂuctuation theorem can be signiﬁcant,
even for weak coupling. We analytically demonstrate on a realistic model system that this mechanism can be
realized by applying an external random force to the system. In other words, we ﬁnd a new ﬂuctuation theorem
for the entropy production of a partial system, in the limit of weak coupling.

Introduction.— In systems where a few slow degrees of
freedom (e.g., that of a colloidal particle in water) interact
with a large number of fast degrees of freedom (e.g., that
of the water molecules) — and there is a clear separation of
timescales between the fast and slow degrees of freedom —
the effects of the fast degrees of freedom on the slow degrees
of freedom can be replaced by an effective white noise (and
dissipation). This leads to a stochastic dynamics for the slow
degrees of freedom where the fast degrees of freedom act as
a heat bath. Within the framework of stochastic thermody-
namics, the heat exchange between a stochastic system (of
slow degrees of freedom) and a bath, and the work done on
a stochastic system can be deﬁned along individual stochastic
trajectories [1–7]. While ﬂuctuations of thermodynamic vari-
ables usually do not play any role in macroscopic systems,
they are important for small systems [8–19] consisting of a
few slow degrees of freedom, where the energies are compa-
rable to kBT . Over the past two decades or so, a number of
remarkable mathematical relations have been found concern-
ing the ﬂuctuations of entropy [20–24], work [25, 26], and
heat [27–31].

The stochastic entropy production in a bath (medium) with
a temperature T , due to an amount of heat Q extracted from
it by a stochastic system, is given by ∆Smed = −Q/T . By as-
signing a certain entropy Ssys for the stochastic system along
the trajectories [24], the total entropy production is deﬁned as
∆Stot = ∆Smed +∆Ssys. In equilibrium ∆Stot = 0, whereas non-
equilibrium processes generate entropy. The ﬂuctuation the-
orem (FT) relates the probability density functions (PDFs) of
positive and negative entropy productions in a given duration,
in the steady state of a non-equilibrium process, by [20–24].

ln(cid:2)P(∆Stot)/P(−∆Stot)(cid:3) = ∆Stot,

tween A and B, the total entropy production for system A
would again satisfy the FT. The question thus naturally arises
whether there is any deviation from the FT, given by Eq. (1),
for vanishingly small coupling (δ → 0).

In this Letter, we show that under certain driving protocols,
there can be signiﬁcant deviations from Eq. (1), even in the
limit δ → 0, yielding a new FT for the entropy production of
a partial system. We propose a general mechanism, by which
the FT for the partial entropy production can be broken un-
der weak coupling. We demonstrate this mechanism for an
experimentally realizable prototypical system — which is ar-
guably the most fundamental stochastic system, namely, the
Brownian motion.
General mechanism.— For a Markov process, the PDF of
the time averaged total entropy production s = (t/τ)−1∆SA
tot
of system A, in a given duration t in the steady state, for large
t, generically, has the form [37]

where the Boltzmann’s constant is set to unity (kB = 1).

Now consider a non-equilibrium system A coupled to an-
other stochastic system B, with a dimensionless coupling
strength δ [see Fig. 1]. The total entropy production of the
combined systems A and B would evidently satisfy the FT,
given by Eq. (1). On the other hand, the FT is not expected
to hold, if the total entropy production is measured by con-
sidering only system A [32–36]. Therefore, any deviations
from the FT as given by Eq. (1) would infer coupling to
other stochastic processes. Clearly, without any coupling be-

where τ is a characteristic time of the system.

First consider the case when system A is isolated from
other stochastic systems (δ = 0). Here we use the nota-
tions g0(λ ) and µ0(λ ) in place of g(λ ) and µ(λ ) respec-
tively. For this isolated system, the FT as in Eq. (1) must
hold for ∆SA
tot. This requires the Gallavotti-Cohen (GC) sym-
metry µ0(λ ) = µ0(1−λ ) and g0(λ ) = g0(1−λ ) to hold, and
both µ0(λ ) and g0(λ ) to be analytic, at least within λ ∈ [0,1].
For t (cid:29) τ, the saddle-point approximation of Eq. (2) gives the

large deviation form [38]: p(s) ∼ exp(cid:2)(t/τ)I0(s)(cid:3), where the

Let us consider the situation where µ0(λ ) is analytic only
within a ﬁnite region bounded by a pair of branch point singu-
larities at λ±. Here λ− < 0 and λ+ > 1 with λ+ +λ− = 1. For
the FT to hold, g0(λ ) must be also analytic within this region
λ ∈ (λ−,λ+). We assume that near these branch points [39]:
as λ → λ+
as λ → λ−
where 0 < α0 < 1. The GC symmetry demands the same
exponent α0 and the constants a and b for the behaviors of
µ0(λ ) near both the branch points λ± and λ+ +λ− = 1. From
Eq. (3), it follows that

Therefore, the LDF is given by

the large deviation form p(s) ∼ exp(cid:2)(t/τ)I(s)(cid:3), where [40]

In other words, as s decreases from ∞ to −∞ the saddle point
λ∗
0 (s) moves from λ− to λ+ on the real λ line. In this case,
since Eq. (1) is valid for all s, the subleading correction terms
to the relation I0(s)−I0(−s) = [λ+ +λ−]s vanish at all orders.
In the presence of a non-zero coupling (δ > 0), we consider
I(s) = µ(λ∗) + λ∗s with µ(cid:48)(λ∗) = −s. Let us suppose that
µ(λ ) has branch points at λ (δ )± . As in the δ = 0 case above,
here we get I(s) ≈ λ (δ )± s as s → ∓∞, at the leading order in s.
This implies that the symmetry function,
f (s) = I(s)− I(−s),

has the asymptotic form f (s) ≈(cid:2)λ (δ )

Since, we do not expect µ(λ ) to obey the GC symmetry, the

leading corrections in s. Therefore, for a ﬁnite δ , the devia-
tions from the straight line f (s) = s, provides a measure of the
violation of the FT. Now the question is whether such devia-
tion persists in the limit δ → 0.
To answer this question, we note that, purely on the general
ground, in the limit δ → 0, there can be four distinct possibil-
ities:

(5)

where λ− < ˜λ− < 0 and 0 < ˜λ+ < λ+. Clearly, the FT is not
violated for the case (P1) in Eq. (6) and one gets the same
LDF I0(s) obtained above for the uncoupled case.

Now, consider the situation (P2). In this case, near ˜λ−, we
can write µ(λ ) = µa(λ ) + µs(λ ) where µa(λ ) and µs(λ ) are
respectively the analytic and singular part of µ(λ ). Evidently,
µa(λ ) → µ0(λ ) as δ → 0. On the other hand, for the singular
part near ˜λ−, for small δ , we assume the form [39]: µs(λ ) ∝
−δ β (λ − ˜λ−)α with β > 0 and 0 < α < 1. Note that, for δ →
0, if λ (δ )− → ˜λ− instead of λ−, then it is necessary that λ− <
˜λ− < 0. In the limit δ → 0, when s increases from −∞ to ∞,
the saddle point λ∗(s) moves from λ+ to ˜λ− on the real λ line.
For [λ∗(s)− ˜λ−](cid:29) δ β /(1−α), the saddle point is dominated by
a(λ∗) = −s, which in the limit δ → 0 reduces
the equation µ(cid:48)
to Eq. (3). Therefore, the LDF is the same I0(s), that has
been obtained for the uncoupled case. On the other hand, for
[λ∗(s) − ˜λ−] (cid:28) δ β /(1−α), the saddle point is dominated by
the singular part of the saddle point equation, which results

λ∗(s) = ˜λ− + O(cid:2)(δ β /s)1/(1−α)(cid:3). This gives I(s) = µa
(cid:0)˜λ− +
O(cid:2)(δ β /s)1/(1−α)(cid:3)(cid:1) + ˜λ−s + O(cid:2)(δ β /sα )1/(1−α)(cid:3). Thus, in the

limit δ → 0, we get

Similar singularities of the LDF have also been found earlier
in the context of work ﬂuctuations [42–44].
It follows from the above expressions of I(s) that, in the
limit δ → 0, for the possibilities (P2), (P3), and (P4), while
f (s) ≈ s for small s, it differs signiﬁcantly for large s. In par-

where (P1)-(P4) represent the four cases given in Eq. (6).
Thus if the analytic region of µ(λ ) is bounded by a pair of
branch points, such that in the limit δ → 0, at least one of the

limiting branch points differs from that of the uncoupled case
(δ = 0), then for large s, the slope of the symmetry function
differs from unity. This prominent deviation is indeed an in-
dication of coupling to an external system. Equation (7) is
our main result, which provides new FT for the entropy pro-
duction of a partial system in the weak coupling limit. In the
following, we demonstrate that the above mechanism can in-
deed be realized in real systems by subjecting it to an external
stochastic forcing.

The model (coupled Brownian motion).— We consider a
system of two Brownian particles (denoted by A and B) cou-
pled to each other by a harmonic potential U(y) = ky2/2,
where y is the separation between them and k is the spring
constant. For simplicity, we set the masses of both the parti-
cles to be equal to m. The Hamiltonian of the coupled sys-
tem is thus given by H = (m/2)(v2
B) +U(y), where vA
and vB are the velocities of the particles A and B respectively.
The whole system is in contact with a heat bath at a tempera-
ture T . We apply an external Gaussian stochastic force fA(t),
with mean zero and correlator (cid:104) fA(t) fA(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2 ¯f 2δ (t − t(cid:48)),
on the particle A. It is possible that the particle B also expe-
riences an force fB(t) (which is assumed to be Gaussian with
mean zero), that may be either correlated or independent to
the force applied on the particle A. Therefore, consider two
opposite situations: (i) where fB(t) is independent of fA(t)
with (cid:104) fB(t) fB(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2α2 ¯f 2δ (t − t(cid:48)) and (ii) where they are
completely correlated to each other, with fB(t) = α fA(t). In
addition to α, we introduce two other dimensionless param-
eters, δ = 2km/γ2 and θ = ¯f 2/(γT ), where γ is the friction
coefﬁcient.

by these branch points. We also ﬁnd that I0(s) obeys Eq. (4).
Now, in the presence of a non-zero coupling δ , we ﬁnd that

λ (δ )
On the other hand, the behavior of λ (δ )− depends on a cer-
tain function r(α,θ ,δ ). For r(α,θ ,δ ) < 0 [(P3) regions in
Figs. 2 (a) and 2 (b)], we get λ (δ )− → λ− as δ → 0 whereas for
r(α,θ ,δ ) > 0 [(P4) regions in Figs. 2 (a) and 2 (b)], we get
λ (δ )− = ˜λ− for all 0 < δ < 1. Here ˜λ− = −[1 + (1 + α2)θ ]−1
for the choice (i) of fB(t) and ˜λ− = −[1 + (1 + α)2θ ]−1 for
the choice (ii). Therefore, in the limit δ → 0, while f (s) ≈ s

the choices of the driving force fB(t) and also for both the
considerations of the entropy production. We ﬁnd that, while
for small s, the exact curves match with the linear function s,
eventually they converge to the large s asymptotic predictions
of f (s).

Concluding remarks.— We have found a new mechanism
by which the FT of the entropy production can be violated in
the presence of a coupling to an external system, even in the
limit of the coupling strength going to zero. In other words,
we have provided a new FT for the entropy production of a
partial system, in the presence of weak coupling, driven by

external random forces. Conversely, our ﬁnding gives a way to
ﬁnd out if a particular stochastic process of interest is coupled
to any other hidden stochastic systems. Thus, it provides a
new application of FT that can be applied to a wide variety of
real experimental small systems.

Finally, we ask whether the effect of the external coupling
can be nulliﬁed. Indeed, we ﬁnd that [37], when the system
is placed in a harmonic trap, we always get λ (δ )± → λ± as
δ → 0. Thus, in this case, the relation f (s) = s is always
satisﬁed in the limit δ → 0. This suggests that weak coupling
cannot affect the FT in the presence of a trap, and hence, this
provides a way to neutralize the inﬂuence of such coupling.

[39] This speciﬁc form is taken only as an explicit example. It is not
necessary to have this speciﬁc form and one can in fact have
other branch point behaviors such as logarithmic. The nature
of the branch point singularity is not important as it only con-
tributes to the subleading correction.

range, it can change the LDF. However, ﬁnally we are in-
terested in the δ → 0 limit and in this limit we can write
g(λ ) = g0(λ ) +δ cg1(λ ), with c > 0, where the function g1(λ )
may have singularities. It is clear that, the singularities of g1(λ )
are not going to contribute to the PDF in the δ → 0 limit.
[41] Both I(s) and its ﬁrst derivative I(cid:48)(s) are continuous, whereas
the second derivative I(cid:48)(cid:48)(s) is discontinuous, at these points.
