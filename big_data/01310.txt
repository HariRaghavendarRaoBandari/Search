RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIES

WITH LINEAR GROWTH UNDER A GENERAL PDE CONSTRAINT

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

Abstract. We deal with lower semi-continuity and minimization properties of functionals of
the form

F (τ ) = ZΩ

f (τ ) dx,

τ : Ω ⊂ RN → Rd

under the PDE constraint

A τ = 0,

where Ω ⊂ RN is an open and bounded domain, A : D(A) ⊂ L1(Ω)d → L1(Ω)m is a linear
diﬀerential operator, and f : Rd → R is a convex integrand with linear growth at inﬁnity. We
provide an explicit formula for the relaxed energy of F in a space of Radon measures. We also
study the dual energy and give a point-wise characterization for generalized minimizers of F .
Our technique does not rely on any special topological assumption on Ω or a constant rank
condition on A that may facilitate the existence of recovery sequences.

The study of the lower semi-continuity of integral problems of the form

1. Introduction

F (u) =ZΩ

f (∇u(x)) dx,

where u : Ω → Rd is a vector valued function and Ω is a subset of RN may be divided into two
main problems. The ﬁrst one, a weaker but rather complex notion of convexity for f arises as a
necessary condition for lower semi-continuity as proved by Morrey [14, 15]. More precisely, he
proved that if f is quasiconvex, non-negative and
f (z) ≤ M (1 + |z|p),

∀z ∈ Rd×N

for p ≥ 1, then

F (u) ≤ lim inf

h

F (uh)

whenever uh ⇀ u in W 1,p. The second one is the lack of equi-integrability for bounded sequences
when p = 1. In other words, u may not necessarily belong to W 1,1. This entails the need to
perform a relaxation in the space of functions of bounded variation, which is deﬁned as

F (u) := inf(cid:26)lim inf

h

ZΩ

f (∇uh) dx : uh → u in L1(Ω)(cid:27) .

An integral representation for F was ﬁrst proved by Goﬀman and Serrin in [13], they showed
that

where ∇u is the absolutely continuous part of Du and Dsu is the singular part of Du, both with
respect to the Lebesgue measure. Particularly, the space of functions of bounded variation can be
seen as a subspace of the space of bounded vector-valued Radon measures under a curl constraint.
This paper considers more general diﬀerential constraints and obtains a similar representation
for the relaxation of such energies based on convex analysis arguments and a clever application
of Ekeland’s Variational principle developed in [5]. Due to the wide range of applications, most
of the existing theory focuses in understanding the case A = curl. However, more general PDE
constraints appear in problems of continuum mechanics and electromagnetism, [16, 17] in the
case p > 1; and in a model for low-volume fraction optimal design in case A = div with p = 1.
Results regarding the lower semi-continuity of integral functionals a more general setting go
back to the notion of A-quasiconvexity, ﬁrst introduced by Dacorogna [8] for operators A whose
kernel coincides with the image of an operator B, and further developed by Fonseca and M¨uller
in [11], Fonseca, Leoni, and M¨uller in [12], and more recently by Ba´ıa, Chermisi, Matias and
Santos in [4]. The references just cited rely on a rigidity assumption on A, Murat’s constant
rank condition. More speciﬁcally, the showed that for f : Ω × Rd → [0, ∞), a normal integrand
with

f (x, z) ≤ c(1 + |z|),

∀(x, z) ∈ Ω × Rd,

and a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator

where A(i) ∈ Rm ⊗ Rd, with the following constant rank property:

Xi=1

Then, a suﬃcient and necessary condition for lower semi-continuity of the functionals

(1)

v 7→ZΩ

f (v), A v = 0.

is the A-quasiconvexity of f . The purpose of the paper is to characterize the lower semi-
continuous envelope of functionals of the form (1) and give suﬃcient and necessary conditions
for optimality in the particular case where f : Rd → R is a convex function. While convexity of
the integrand is indeed a strong condition to avoid the mathematical abstact of A-quasiconvexity,
we only impose very mild assumptions on A. In particular, general linear diﬀerential operators
and linear-pseudo diﬀerential operators of arbitrary degree will ﬁt into out setting. Lastly, it is
worth to mention that we do not assume Murat’s constant rank condition.

1.1. Statement of the problem and main results. Throughout this paper Ω will denote an
open and bounded subset of RN . Let Z be a subspace of Rd. In the sense of unbounded linear
operators, we will use the script A to denote a general linear operator A : D(A) ⊂ L1(Ω, Z) →
L1(Ω; Rm) with the only property that

(2)

C ∞(Ω; Z) ⊂ D(A),

and Z ⊂ ker(A).

We investigate variational integrals of the form

F (τ ) =ZΩ

We consider the problem

f (τ ) dx,

for τ ∈ L1(Ω; Z), τ0 ∈ D(A).

(P)

minimize F in ker(A).

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

The integrand f : Rd → R is assumed to be a Borel, and convex function. As our main
assumption, we imposse the linear growth condition

|f (z)| ≤ c(1 + |z|),

(3)
This condition ensures that F is ﬁnite in L1(Ω, Rd) and in particular the inﬁmum of the problem
(P) may not take the value +∞. However, even if strong regularity assumptions on f are made,
the existence of an element attaining the inﬁmum is not guaranteed. Our ﬁrst result is an
integral representation of the relaxation of F with respect to the weak-⋆ topology in L1, which
is compact in the larger space of Radon measures. Possibly abusing the notation, we will still
denote by A the extension of our main operator to the space of Radon measures M(Ω; Z).

∀z ∈ Rd.

Theorem 1. The lower semi-continuous envelope of F under the constraint A = 0, and with
respect to the the weak-⋆ topology for bounded Radon measures is given by the functional

Here, f∞ is a convex positively one-homogeneous function on Rd known as the recession function
of f deﬁned as

As mentioned before, several applications are closely related to the understanding of the

relaxed minimization problem described as:

(P)

minimize

(cid:8)F (λ) : λ ∈ M(Ω; X) ∩ ker(A)(cid:9) .

One way to characterize solutions of problem (P) is by considering its dual problem. Recall that,
A : L1(Ω; Z) → L1(Ω; Rm) is a densely deﬁned linear operator and therefore one may consider
its adjoint A∗ : D(A∗) ⊂ L∞(Ω; Rm) → L∞(Ω; Z). Distinctly from problem (P), if one assumes
that D(A∗) is a closed subspace of L∞(Ω; Rm), its dual problem involves a maximization over
a compact space. This means that the dual problem is a maximization problem where the
supremum is achieved. Consider the Fenchel conjugate f ∗ : Rd → R ∪ {∞} of f , which is given
by the formula f ∗(z∗) := supz∈Rd{z∗ · z f (z)}.
Theorem 2. The dual problem of (P) is given by the following maximization problem:
(P∗)

{R(u∗) : u∗ ∈ L∞(Ω; Rm) ∩ D(A∗)} ,

maximize

where

R(u∗) := hA∗ u∗, τ0iL∞×L1 −ZΩ

f ∗(A u∗) dx.

Even more, there is no gap between the problems (P) and (P), and problem (P∗). In other words,

inf

τ0+ker(A)

F = min

τ0+ker(A)

F = sup
D(A∗)

R.

Under mild conditions on f , one can ensure that a solution w∗ of problem (P∗) is unique.
Moreover, it is well-known that in this case, the optimality conditions for a classic minimizer
τ ∈ L1(Ω; X) of problem (P) are equivalent to the point-wise characterizations

f ((τ )(x)) + f ∗(A w∗(x)) = (τ )(x) · A∗ w∗(x),

for almost every x ∈ Ω.

We show that a similar result holds for generalized minimizers, and to do so we will employ
a similar pairing to the one developed by Anzellotti in [3]. In this line, we also follow closely

4

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

those ideas by Beck and Schmidt in [5] where they considered A = curl (plus Dirichlet boundary
conditions). In the following we shall consider

λ ∈ D(A) ⊂ M(Ω; Z),

w ∈ D(A∗) ∩ C 0(Ω; Rm).

Deﬁne the linear functional Jλ, A∗wK : D(Ω) → R

hJλ, A∗wK, ϕiD ′ ×D :=ZΩ

A(λ) · wϕ dx +ZΩ

w · A(∇ϕ) · dλ.

As we will see, it turns out that the functionals Jλ, A∗uK and |Jλ, A∗uK| are Radon measures in
Ω. Even more, they are absolutely continuous with respect to the measure |λ| in Ω. Hence, by
the Radon-Nykodym theorem, we may consider

dJλ, A∗uK

d|λ|

(x),

|λ|-almost everywhere in Ω.

It is precisely this generalized inner product that carries the conditions for optimality as illus-
trated in our main result. Set

λ = λa + λs,

where λa ≪ LN ,

λs ⊥ LN .

Theorem 3. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) λ solves problem (P) and u∗ solves problem (P),
(2) one of the conditions

f (λa + τ0) + f ∗(A∗u∗) = (λa + τ0) · A∗u∗,

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state problem (P∗) and prove its equivalence
to problem (P) via convex analysis (Theorem 2). In order to prove the integral representation
of F , we exhibit a common upper and lower bound. The key step is to show an upper bound
for F since a lower bound follows more and less by standard Convex Analysis arguments. To
establish the upper bound, we mainly follow the proof of Ambrosio and Buttazzo [1] in the case
where A = curl and f is a quasiconvex integrand. In their argument, the central idea is that
one can regard F as a set-valued function which can be extended to a Radon measure. It is
precisely here that Ekeland’s Variational Principle plays a fundamental role. Once this is shown,
the integral representation from Theorem 1 follows easily. Section 3 is devoted to the analysis of
optimality conditions and the proof of Theorem 3. As already mentioned, our exposition follows
closely those ideas of [5] and [3]. Finally, in Section 4 we apply our results to an optimal design
in conductivity where one consider composite materials result of the homogenization with low
volume fraction perfect isolators.

topology in M(Ω; Z) is precisely ker(cid:0)A(cid:1).

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

Lemma 4. Let Ω ⊂ RN be an open and star-shaped domain. Let λ ∈ ker(A) ⊂ M(Ω; Z), then
there exists a sequence {λk} ⊂ ker(A) ∩ L1(Ω; Z) with the following property

λk

∗⇀ λ in M(Ω; Z),

Proof. First we extend λ to a Radon measure in RN by zero (we still denote this measure by
λ). Let r > 1 and consider the scaling gr(x) = rx. Next, we consider the molliﬁcation of the
push-forward measures for gr

λr := λ#gr ∗ ρr−1 ∈ L1(RN ; Z),

where ρs is a standard molliﬁer at scale s. Observe that since Ω is a star-shaped domain, the
contention Ω ⊂ gr(Ω) holds for every r > 1. Let us check that λr ∈ ker(A) in Ω. We ﬁrst notice
that by linearity of A the following identity holds

(5)

A λr = Aλ#gr ∗ ρr−1.

Let ϕ ∈ D(gr(Ω); Rm) and set ϕr(x) := ϕ(rx) ∈ D(Ω, Rm), it follows that

A∗ ϕ d(λ#gr )

(A∗ ϕ) ◦ gr dλ

hA λ#gr , ϕi =ZRN
=ZRN
= r ·ZRN

A∗ ϕr dλ

= r · hA λ, ϕri
= 0.

This proves that (Aλ#gr )(x) = 0 in gr(Ω). Since for every x ∈ Ω one has that Br−1(x) ⊂ gr(Ω),
it follows from (5) that A λr = 0 in Ω. This proves the claim for λr(k) where k = 1, 2, . . . and
r(k) = 1 + 1/k.
(cid:3)

Remark 1. Note that, since for every g ∈ L1(RN ), both sequences {g#gr } and {g ∗ ρr−1}
converge strongly to g for the L1 topology as r → 1, then the sequence {g#gr ∗ ρr−1} converges
strongly to g for the L1 topology as r → 1.

2.2. Duality on convex optimization. We recall some facts of the theory of convex functions.
We follow closely those ideas from [10, Ch. III] but we develop them in the slight more general
case for perturbations with unbounded linear operators. Along this chapter X and Y will be
two topological vector spaces placed in duality with their duals X ∗ and Y ∗ respectively by
the pairing h·, ·iX ∗×X (respectively the analogous for Y and Y ∗). The subscript notation will
be dropped as it is understood that the correspondent pairing apply only on their respective
domains. Elements on X and Y will be denoted by the letters u, v, w, . . . and elements in X ∗
and Y ∗ by the letters u∗, v∗, w∗, . . . For a continuous function F : X → R, we deﬁne a lower
semi-continuous, and convex function by letting

F (u∗) := sup
X

{hu, u∗i − F (u)},

u∗ ∈ X ∗.

This function is known as the conjugate function of F . We are concerned with the minimization
problem

As in [10], problem (P ) will be termed the primal problem.

∀u ∈ X.

The dependence on p is commonly understood as the perturbed problem.

The dual problem. Let Φ∗ : X ∗ × Y ∗ → R be the conjugate of Φ in the duality (X × Y, X ∗ × Y ∗).
We deﬁne the dual problem as:

If the function p 7→ Φ(u, p) is convex and l.s.c in Y , then the following identities hold,

and

In this case, we may then write

2.2.1. Perturbation via linear operators. We shall assume the existence of a densely deﬁned
linear operator A : D(A) ⊂ X → Y with adjoint operator A∗ : D(A∗) ⊂ Y ∗ → X ∗. We shall
also assume the function F (as in problem (P)) can be written as

(12)

F (u) =(J(u, Au)

+∞

if u ∈ D(A),
else,

where J : X × Y → R. The correspondent perturbations will be of the form

Φ(u, p) = J(u, Au − p).

We will make use of the following abstract convex analysis lemma for the calculation of the
adjoint of certain functionals of the form F ◦ B where B is a densely deﬁned linear operator (see
[7, Theorem 5.1]).

Lemma 5. Let X and Y be given Banach spaces, let B : X → Y be a linear operator with dense
domain D(B) and let F : Y → R be a convex function which we assume continuous in at least
a point of Im(B). Then, for every x∗ ∈ X ∗ it holds

(13)

(F ◦ B)∗(x∗) = inf{F ∗(y∗) : B∗y∗ = x∗}.

Furthermore, the inﬁmum at right hand side is achieved whenever one of the quantities aboved
described is ﬁnite.

Remark 2. Notice that, the right hand side of (13) takes the value +∞ if and only if x /∈ R(A∗).

Lemma 6. In the present context, problem (P ) reads

J(u, Au).

Under the stated assumptions on A, problem (P ∗) takes the form

(14)

(P ∗)

p∈Y ∗

{−J ∗(A∗p∗, −p∗) : p∗ ∈ D(A∗)}.

Proof. If we set A : X × Y → R : (u, p) 7→ (u, Au − p), then we get

= inf{J ∗(u∗, q∗) : (A)∗(u∗, q∗) = (0, p∗)}

Observe that, D((A)∗) = X × D(A∗). Hence, (A)∗(u∗, q∗) = (0, p∗) if and only if

hp∗, pi = h(u∗, q∗), A(u, p)i = hu∗ + A∗q∗, ui + h−q∗, pi

∀(u, p) ∈ D(A) × Y.

This is equivalent to set −p∗ = q∗ ∈ D(A∗) and u∗ + A∗q∗ = u∗ − A∗p∗ = 0. Hence, (18) yields

Φ∗(0, p∗) = J ∗(A∗p∗, −p∗)

whenever p∗ ∈ D(A∗), the conclusion of the proof is a consequence of Remark 2.

2.3. Inf-stability. We recall some facts on the commutativity of the supremum of integral
functionals valued on a certain family F of measurable functions. The results gathered here can
be found in [6, Theorem 1] and [18, Prop. 1.14]. During this chapter µ will denote an arbitrary
positive measure.

Deﬁnition 7. A set F of Lµ(Ω; Rd) is said to be inf-stable if for any continuous partition
i=1 αiui
belongs to F. A subset F of Lµ(Ω) is called C 1 inf-stable family if for every partition of unity

of unity (α1, ..., αn) such that α1, ..., αn ∈ C(Ω), for every u1, ..., un in F, the sum Pn
(α1, ..., αn) such that α1, ..., αn ∈ C 1(Ω) there exists u ∈ F such that u ≤Pn

i=1 αiui.

Theorem 8. For any subset F of Lµ(Ω; Rd) there exists a smallest closed-valued measurable
multifunction Γ such that ∀u ∈ F, u(x) ∈ Γ(x) µ a.e. (as smallest refers to inclusion). More-
over, there exists a sequence {un} in F such that Γ(x) = cl{un(x)} for µ a.e. x ∈ Ω.

Deﬁnition 9. We write

Γ = ess-supu∈F {u(·)}

and say that Γ is the essential supremum of the multifunctions x 7→ {u(x) : u ∈ F}.

Theorem 10. Let j : Ω × Rd → R be a normal convex integrand. Denote by J the functional

J(u) :=ZΩ

j(x, u(x)) dµ(x)

∀u ∈ Lµ(Ω, Rd).

8

there exists u0 ∈ F such that J(u0) ∈ R. Then,

Moreover, if F is a C 1 inf-stable family of Lµ(Ω), then

inf

u∈FZΩ

u dµ =ZΩ

ess-inf u∈F u(x) dµ(x).

3. The dual problem

We aim to understand the dual problem of (P). Recall from (2), that A is a densely deﬁned

linear unbounded operator. Let ϕ ∈ C ∞(Ω; Rd) and deﬁne

Using the notation of Section 2, we set

fϕ(x, z) = f (z + τ0(x)) − ϕ(x) · z.

X = L1(Ω; Z)d,

Y = L1(Ω; Rm),

A : D(A) ⊂ L1(Ω; Z) → L1(Ω; Rm), A∗ : D(A∗) ⊂ L∞(Ω; Rm) → L∞(Ω; X),

Jϕ : L1(Ω; Z) × L1(Ω; Rm) : (τ, q) 7→(Ifϕ(τ )

+∞

if

q = 0,
else,

Φϕ(τ, p) = Jϕ(τ, A τ − p).

In this way, we may write (Pϕ) as

(Pϕ)

inf
X

Φϕ(u, 0) = inf

τ ∈ker A

Fϕ(τ ).

It is not hard to see that with this deﬁnitions X, Y, Fϕ, Jϕ and Φϕ possess the desired assumptions
from Section 2.

Lemma 11. The conjugate of Jϕ, J ∗

ϕ : L∞(Ω)d × L∞(Ω)l → R, is the functional given as

(τ ∗, p∗) 7→ −hτ ∗ + ϕ, τ0i + If ∗ (τ ∗ + ϕ).

Proof. By deﬁnition,

(19)

(20)

J ∗
ϕ(τ ∗, p∗) = sup

= −hτ ∗ + ϕ, τ0i + (If )∗(τ ∗ + ϕ).

τ ∈L1(Ω;Z)(cid:26)hτ ∗, τ i −ZΩ

f (τ0 + τ ) dx + hϕ, τ i(cid:27)

To prove that (If )∗ = If ∗ is somewhat more subtle. We argue as follows:
Step 1. We point out that L1(Ω; Z) is an inf-stable family in L(Ω; Rd).
Step 2. Since f has linear growth, If is proper in L1(Ω; Z).
Step 3. We ﬁx τ ∗ ∈ L∞(Ω; Z) and apply Theorem 10 to F = L1(Ω; Rd), µ = dLN , and
j(x, z) := f (z) − τ ∗(x) · z (observe that j is indeed a normal convex integrand) to ﬁnd out that

(If )∗(τ ∗) = − inf

τ ∈L1(Ω;Z)ZΩ

j(x, τ (x)) dx = −ZΩ

inf

z∈Γ(x)

j(x, z) dx,

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

where Γ(x) = ess-supτ ∈L1(Ω;Z){τ (·)} = Rd. Since inf z∈Rd j(x, z) is nothing else than −f ∗(z) for
a.e. x ∈ Ω, it follows that

(If )∗(τ ∗) = If ∗ (τ ∗).

(cid:3)

Due to Lemma 6 and Lemma 11, the dual problem then reads:

(P ∗

maximize Rϕ in the space L∞(Ω; Rm),

where Rϕ : L∞(Ω; Rm) → R is the functional given by

hA∗ w∗ + ϕ, τ0i −ZΩ

−∞

f ∗(A∗w + ϕ) dx if w∗ ∈ D(A∗),

else.

Rϕ(w∗) :=


Recall that, since f is convex, then so it is fϕ(x, z) in the z variable. Using the deﬁnition of
conjugate one gets that

fϕ(x, z) ≥ z · z∗ − (fϕ(x, ·))∗(z∗)

= z · z∗ + τ0(x) · (z∗ + ϕ) − f ∗(z∗ + ϕ(x))

∀z, z∗ ∈ Rd, ∀x ∈ Ω.

Hence

Therefore,

(21)

Fϕ(τ ) ≥ hτ, A∗ w∗i + hτ0, A∗ w∗ + ϕi −ZΩ

f ∗(A∗w∗ + ϕ)

Fε : ker(A) ⊂ (L1, δ−1k · k1) → R. It follows from the strong topology in L1 and the growth
conditions from f that Fε is continuous and ﬁnite. It follows from Ekeland’s Variational Principle
that there must exists ˜τ ∈ ker(A) such that

k˜τ − τ k1(Ω) ≤ δ,

Fε(˜τ ) < Fε(τ ) +

k˜τ − τ k1(Ω) ∀ τ ∈ ker(A).

In particular, taking τ = τ it follows that

If this time we take τ = ˜τ − sΦ, for Φ ∈ ker(A) then we get

get

∀ Φ ∈ ker(A).

The fact that v = ∂zfϕ(·, ˜τ ) ∈ L∞(Ω)d follows from the uniform Lipschitz bound for f .

An application of the previous lemma with δ = ε yields the existence of a minimizing sequence

and

kτ k − τkkL2(Ω) ≤ εk,

(23)
Since ∂f is uniformly founded in Rd, it follows that the sequence {vk} is uniformly bounded in
L∞(Ω; Rd). Therefore, there exists v ∈ L∞(Ω; Rd) and a subsequence (not relabeled) such that
∗⇀ v for the L∞ weak-⋆ topology. As a consequence of (23) one gets that v ∈ (ker A)⊥ =

4. The relaxed problem

So far we have not discussed the optimality conditions for problem (P ). In part, this owes
to the fact that (P ) may not necessarily be well-posed. More precisely, due to the lack of
compactness in L1 one must look into a so-called relaxation. The latter has a meaning by
extending the basis space to the space of bounded vector-valued Radon measures.
It is well
known, see [6] for a detailed monograph on the topic, that extending the functional from L1 to
M by taking the lower semi-continuous hull

F : τ 7→ lim inf
η→λ

F (τ )

in the weak-⋆ topology is given by

F (λ) = sup {hλ, ϕi − F ∗(ϕ) : ϕ ∈ Cc(Ω; Z)} .

The ﬁrst step is to exploit the convex analysis duality for problems (Pϕ) and (P ∗
ϕ) in order to
ﬁnd an equivalent expression to −F ∗(ϕ) which in turn will allow us to reduce the problem to a
similar one to the relaxation of gradient valued energies as in [1].

Using the deﬁnition of convex conjugate and Corollary 13.1 one gets that

The next lemma follows closely the exposition of the upper bound in [1], it will be useful in

the proving a integral representation for F .

Lemma 14. For λ ∈ M(Ω; Z) ∩ ker(A), we deﬁne a positive function µ on open sets:

E 7→ sup(cid:26)hλ + τ0, ϕi + hA∗ w∗, τ0i −ZE

f ∗(A∗ w + ϕ) dx : ϕ ∈ Cc(E; Rd), w ∈ W0(A∗, E)(cid:27) ,

where E ⊂ RN is open. Then, µ may be extended to a σ-additive measure µ deﬁned in the Borel
σ-algebra in Ω.

12

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

Proof. First observe that since f is a positive and convex function, then −f ∗(0) ≥ 0 and thus µ
is a positive function on open subsets of Ω. According to [9], µ may be extended to a σ-additive
measure deﬁned in the Borel σ-algebra in RN if and only if the following conditions hold for for
opens sets E, E′ ⊂ RN :

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

By deﬁnition,

E′ ⊂ E ⇒ µ(E′) ≤ µ(E).

E′ ∩ E = ∅ ⇒ µ(E′ ∪ E) = µ(E′) + µ(E),

µ(E) ≤ sup{µ(E′) : E′ ⊂⊂ E},

µ(E′ ∪ E) ≤ µ(E′) + µ(E).

µ(E) = sup(cid:26)ZE

ϕ dλ −ZE

f ∗(ϕ + A∗ w) dx : ϕ ∈ Cc(E; Rd), wW A∗

(E)(cid:27) .

If E ⊂ E′, then Cc(E) ⊂ Cc(E′) and W A∗
(E′), thus µ(E′) ≤ µ(E), this proves
(24). Property (25) is an easy consequence of the linearity of the integral and the fact that for
every pair of functions w1 ∈ W A∗
(E′), there exists a function w ∈ w1 ∈
W A∗
(E ∪ E′) such that w|E = w1 and w|E ′ = w2 whenever E′ ∩ E = ∅. In fact, it easy to see
by a partition of unity argument that the following property holds

(E) and w2 ∈ W A∗

(28)

µ(E ∪ E′) ≤ µ(E) + µ(E′),

for every E, E′ ⊂ Ω,

this proves (27). To see that (26) holds, we ﬁrst use the convexity of f to get an upper bound
on µ, using that f (z) ≥ z · z′ − f ∗(z′) for every z, z′ ∈ Rd we get that

0

(29)

µ(A) ≤ |λ|(A) +ZA

f (τ0),

for every open set A ⊂ Ω.

Since |λ| and f (τ0(x)) dLN are both Radon measures, for a ﬁxed set ⊂ Ω and a ﬁxed positive
constant ε, we may ﬁnd an compactly contained open set E′ ⊂⊂ E such that

λ(E \ E′) ≤ ε,

ZE\E ′

f (τ0) dx ≤ ε.

Hence, using (28) and (29) we obtain

µ(E′′) ≥ µ(E) − µ(E \ E′) ≥ µ(E) − λ(E \ E′) −ZE\E ′

f (τ0) dx ≥ µ(E) − 2ε

for every open set E′′ ⊂ Ω containing E′. Since ε was chosen arbitrarily, this proves property
(26). Since µ ﬁts the aforementioned characterization, there must be a positive measure, which
we denote by µ, deﬁned in the Borel σ-algebra in Ω.
(cid:3)

Proposition 15. Let λ ∈ M(Ω; Z) ∩ ker A and let µ be its associated Radon measure from
Lemma 14. Then µ ≪ dLN + λs, and the following bounds hold:

Proof. Let z ∈ Ω and let E := Bs(z) ⊂ Ω be an open ball with radius s centered at z with
|λ|(E) = 0. Since E is a star-shaped domain, Lemma 4 yields the existence of a sequence
∗⇀ λ in E and |λr|(E) → |λ|(E) as r ց 1. Fix
{λr} ⊂ L1(E, Z) with A λr = 0 such that λr

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

ϕ ∈ Cc(E; Rd); and w ∈ W A
we get that

0 (E). Using the fact that −f ∗(x) ≤ −x · y + f (y) for every x, y ∈ Rd,

hλ + τ0, ϕi + hτ0, A∗ w∗i −ZE

Hence, as the left hand side is independent of r,

hλ + τ0, ϕi + hτ0, A∗ w∗i −ZE

f ∗(ϕ + A∗ w) dx ≤ hλ − λr, ϕi +ZE
= hϕ, λ − λri +ZE
rց1 ZE

f ∗(ϕ + A∗ w) dx ≤ lim inf

f (λr + τ0) dx

f (λr + τ0) dx.

f (λr + τ0) dx.

Now, observe that the right hand side of (32) does not depend on ϕ and w∗, and so we may
take the supremum over their correspondent function spaces to get

(32)

(33)

µ(E) ≤ lim inf

f (λr + τ0) dx.

rց1 ZE

We may bound the right hand side of (33) in two ways. In order to prove (30), we use that f∞
is a continuous, 1-homogeneous, positive function in Rd with f∞ ≥ f to get

f (λr +τ0) dx ≤ lim inf

that

To prove bound (31), we use the explicit form of λr provided by Lemma 4. Recall that, λr =

5. The pairing Jλ, A∗uK and the optimality conditions

This section adapts those ideas introduced in [3] to our current setting. In the following we

shall consider consider

(40)

λ ∈ M(Ω)d ∩ {µ : Aµ ∈ L1(Ω)l}),

w ∈ D(A∗) ∩ C 0(Ω)l.

Deﬁnition 17. We deﬁne the linear functional Jλ, A∗wK : D(Ω) → R as

hJλ, A∗wK, ϕi :=ZΩ

A(λ)wϕ dx +ZΩ

w · A(∇ϕ) · dλ =ZΩ

A(ϕλ)w dx.

Remark 3. The previous deﬁnition is well-deﬁned. Indeed, since A(λ) ∈ L1(Ω), the ﬁrst term
of the right hand side is well-deﬁned as w ∈ L∞. The remaining term’s integrability follows
from the continuity of w.

16

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

Let w ∈ D(A∗) and let {wk} ⊂ Z(Ω) be any sequence such that wk

∗⇀ w in L∞(Ω)l and

deﬁne (under a possible abuse of notation) for any λ ∈ Y (Ω) and any ϕ ∈ D(Ω)

hJλ, A∗wK, ϕi := lim
k→∞

hJλ, A∗wkK, ϕi.

The previous extension is well-deﬁned since for any sequence {wk} ⊂ Z(Ω) with wk
gets

hJλ, A∗wkK, ϕi = 0.

lim
k→∞

Remark 4. The linear mappings λ 7→ Jλ, A∗wK and w 7→ Jλ, A∗wK are (N (A), weak∗) and
(D(A∗), weak∗) respectively continuous into the space (D ′, s).
Theorem 18. The functional Jλ, A∗uK may be extended to a Radon measure in Ω. Furthermore,
for any open set ω ⊂⊂ Ω and any ϕ ∈ C0(ω), one has

|hJλ, A∗uK, ϕi| ≤ sup
ω

|ϕ| · |λ|(ω)kA∗uk∞(ω).

Proof. Let δ > 0 and consider the molliﬁcations wδ := ρδ ⋆ w. Since ω is compactly contained in
Ω it turns out that for δ small enough kwδk∞(ω) ≤ kwk∞(ω +Bδ) and similarly for kA∗wδk∞(ω).
On the one hand, uniform convergence implies

|hJλ, A∗wδK, ϕi| → |hJλ, A∗wK, ϕi|

(41)
On the other hand, observe that for the suﬃciently smooth functions wδ, hJλ, A∗wδK, ϕi actually
coincides with h(λ · A∗wδ), ϕi. Bounds for the latter read
(42)

|ϕ| · |λ|(ω)kA∗wk∞(ω + Bδ).

∀ϕ ∈ D(ω).

|h(λ · A∗wδ), ϕi| ≤ sup
ω

The claim on D(ω) follows by plugging (41) on (42) and letting δ → 0. The bound (42) tells us
that we may extend to M(Ω) with the same bound as linear operator.
(cid:3)
Corollary 18.1. The measures Jλ, A∗uK and |Jλ, A∗uK| are absolutely continuous with respect
to the measure |λ| in Ω. Moreover, an application of the Radon-Nikodym diﬀerentiation theorem
yields

Indeed, this a simple consequence of Chacon’s biting lemma and the continuity of the mapping
λ 7→ Jλ, A∗wK under the weak star topology.
Theorem 19. Let w ∈ D(A∗) ∩ C 0(Ω)l and λ ∈ D(A), and assume x ∈ Ω is a Lebesgue point
for both measures dλ
with respect to |λ|. If R(A∗w) < +∞ in a neighborhood of

in Ω

for a certain vector σ depending on the x-neighborhood values of A∗w. In this sense we avoid
some technical procedures involving the continuity of the subgradient for certain functions (in
this case applied to f∞). However, it should be pointed out that such result remains true.

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

17

Proof. For the ﬁrst part of the proof we follow closely the proof in [5]. The idea is to use
approximations on λ and separate the inner product in suitable 1-homogeneous functions in
∗⇀ λ. Recall,
order to apply Reshetnyak’s theorem. Let {λk} ⊂ L1(Ω)d be a sequence with λk
from Remark 4 one gets

(43)

Jλk, A∗wK ∗⇀ Jλ, A∗wK

in M(Ω).

Therefore, for a.e. r ∈ (0, R), R = R(x) a suﬃciently small positive constant, the following
convergence holds

(44)

Jλ, A∗wK(Ω ∩ Br(x)) = lim

k→∞ZΩ∩Br(x)

λk · A∗w dx.

We introduce the short hand notations

v :=

dλ
d|λ|

(x),

πv⊥ : Rd → Rd.

We write the inner product in the following way,

(45)

λk · A∗w = (λk · v)+(A∗w · w) − (λk · v)−(A∗w · w) + pv⊥(λk) · pv⊥(A∗w).

The following observations are in place: Each function (z · v)+,(z · v)− and |pv⊥(z)| is positively
1-homogeneous with respect to the z variable with bounds z · v + |z − v|, |z − v| and |z − v|
respectively. Therefore we are in position to apply Reshetnyak’s theorem for a.e. r ∈ (0, R). For
the second part, we make the simple observation that for R is suﬃciently small by assumption
f ∗(A∗w) < +∞ and therefore

f∞(v) ≥ v · A∗w(x)

for a.e.

r ∈ (0, R),

for a.e. x ∈ Br(x).

d|λ| := f∞(v)[II(r) + I(r)].

It follows, by (44), that

Jλ, A∗wK(Ω ∩ Br(x)) ≤ f∞(v) · [3I(r) + II(r)].

Ddividing by |λ|(Ω ∩ Br(x)) on both sides and letting r → 0, by assumption on x and the facts
that I(r) → 0 and II(r) → 1 as r → 0 we get
dJλ, A∗wK

(x) ≤ f∞(v).

The claim follows from the deﬁnition of v.

∗⇀ λ consider the sequence of positive
Theorem 20. Let {λk} be a minimizing sequence with λk
Radon measures {f (λk)}. Then, the following convergence, in the sense of bounded Radon
measures over Ω, holds

f (λk)

⇀ f (λa) LN + f∞(cid:18) dλs

d|λs|(cid:19) d|λs|.

Proof. Since {λk} is a minimizing sequence, the sequence of problem (P) is uniformly bounded
in M(Ω). This yields the existence of g ∈ M(Ω) with f (λk) ∗⇀ µ (and therefore convergence in
the sense of distributions holds as well). Let w∗ ⊂ D(A∗) ∩ C 1(Ω; Rm) be a solution for problem
(P∗). By convexity of f and due to Remark 4 it follows that

f (λk + τ0) ≥ hτ0, A∗w∗i − f ∗(A∗w∗)

D ′
→ Jλ, A∗w∗K − f ∗(A∗w∗) ∀ j ∈ N.

Hence, we get

(55)
in the sense of real-valued measures. On the other hand, the fact that Jλ, A∗ w∗K(Ω) = hAλ, w∗i
and that g(∂Ω) = 0 together yield

µ ≥ Jλ, A∗w∗K − f ∗(A∗w∗),

Jλ, A∗w∗K − f ∗(A∗w∗) = inf

u∈D(A∗)

R(u) = F (λ) = µ(Ω).

This, together with (55) give

µ = Jλ, A∗wK − f ∗(A∗w).

Hence, using that λa · A∗w − f (A∗w) ≤ f (λa) for LN a.e. x ∈ Ω and that Jλ,A∗K
|λ| a.e. x ∈ Ω we get that

d|λ| ≤ f∞(λs) for

(57)

so that equality must hold due to the fact that g(Ω) = F (λ). In other words,

Jλ, A∗wK − f ∗(A∗w) LN ≤ f (λa) LN + f∞(cid:18) dλs
Jλ, A∗wK = (f (λa) + f ∗(A∗ w)) LN + f∞(cid:18) dλs

RELAXATION AND MINIMIZATION OF CONVEX INTEGRAL ENERGIE

Theorem 21. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) λ is a generalized solution of problem (P) and u∗ solves problem (P),
(2) one of the conditions

f (λa + τ0) + f ∗(A∗u∗) = (λa + τ0) · A∗u∗,

a.e. in Ω,

A∗u∗ ∈ ∂f (λa + τ0)
(λa + τ0) ∈ ∂f ∗(A∗u∗)

a.e. in Ω,

a.e. in Ω,

and the condition

|λs| − a.e. in Ω.

Proof. The argument easily follows from (57) and the fact that
