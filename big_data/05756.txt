Abstract

In the models with vector like quark doublets, the mass matrices of up and down type quarks

are related. Precise diagonalization for the mass matrices became an obstacle in the numerical

studies.

In this work we propose a diagonalization method at ﬁrst. As its application, in the

standard model with one vector like quark doublet we present quark mass spectrum, Feynman

rules for the calculation of B → Xsγ. We ﬁnd that i) under the constraints of the CKM matrix
measurements, the mass parameters in the bilinear term are constrained to a small value by the

small deviation from unitarity; ii) compared with the fourth generation extension of the standard

model, there is an enhancement to B → Xsγ process in the contribution of vector like quark,
resulting a non-decoupling eﬀect in such models.

INTRODUCTION

Though the standard model (SM) has been veriﬁed to be correct times by times, many

new physics beyond standard model are proposed to solve both experimental and aesthetical

problems, such as neutrino masses, µ anomalous magnetic movement problem or hierarchy

problem, etc. Many new models introduce vector like particles (VLP) [1] whose right handed
and left handed components transform in the same way under the weak SU(2)×U(1) gauge
group. The extension is acceptable because the anomalies generated by the VLPs cancel

automatically, and vector quarks can be heavy naturally. VLPs also arise in some grand

uniﬁcation theories. For example, in order to explain the little hierarchy problem between
the traditional GUT scale and string scale, a testable ﬂipped SU(5) × U(1)X model are
proposed in Ref. [2] in which the TeV-scale VLPs were introduced [3]. Such kind of models

can be constructed from the free fermionic string constructions at the Kac-Moody level

one [4, 5] and from the local F-theory model [2, 6].

However when we do the ﬂavor physics with doublet VLPs in these models [7, 8], a

problem always appears when we are dealing with the mass spectrum of quarks and leptons.

Let us start with the SM in which all fermion masses come from the Yukawa couplings.

After the spontaneously gauge symmetry breaking, we can get two separate mass matrices

MU , MD for the up and down type fermions. The mass eigen states are obtained after the

diagonalization

Z †

U MU UU = M D

U , Z †

DMDUD = M D
D ,

(1)

where M D

U = diag.[mu, mc, mt], M D

D = diag.[md, ms, mb]. The physical measurable parame-

ters are mi and the so called CKM matrix

VCKM = U †

U UD.

(2)

Since MU , MD come from separate Yukawa couplings, we can always set one of the matrices

diagonal, for example MU , and use the CKM matrix to get the Yukawa couplings

for the calculation in ﬂavor physics. Note that v is the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of

Such a trick can not be used in case of the participation of a vector doublet, namely Q

with gauge charge 3, 2, 1

the lagrangian

The mass matrices for up and down type quarks are related to each other. Therefore, we can

not set one of the matrices diagonal and the CKM matrix can not be got easily. The shooting

method is always used to treat such an obstacle. Random MU and MD are generated to

meet the requirements after diagonlization: the mass of eigen state and the measurements

of elements of CKM matrix. However this is too much time consuming, and precise solution

for diagonalization is almost unavailable. Although this is just a numerical problem, when

one treats the VLP contributions to the ﬂavor physics seriously, diagonalization of quark

matrices will be the ﬁrst and important step.

In this paper, we will ﬁrst propose a general method to solve the obstacle in models with
vector like quark doublets. As its application, we will study rare B decay B → Xsγ in the
SM with one vector like quark doublet. The paper is organized as follows. We show the
detail of the trick in Section II. The simple application to B → Xsγ process, including quark
mass spectrum, Feynman rules and the Wilson coeﬃcients, as well as the numerical analysis
for calculation of B → Xsγ is shown in Section III. A summary is given in Section IV.

II. THE TRICK OF DIAGONALIZATION OF VECTOR QUARK DOUBLET

Firstly, we address the problem clearly on how to deal with the diagonalization of N × N

matrix MU and MD:

Considering that there are some same parameters in MU and MD, we ﬁnd that a very

simple way is to add two matrices in Eq. (6)

MU + MD = (cid:16)ZU M D

U UCKMN + ZDM D

Obviously, the mass inputs form bilinear terms vanish. We can denote the matrix in the

form as

MU + MD = MU D = 


MA MB

M0 MC




,

(9)

in which MA, MB, M0 are (N − 1) × (N − 1), (N − 1) × 1 and 1 × (N − 1) matrices
correspondingly.

To prepare for the diagonalization,

In this
work we chose the diagonal mass matrix elements of quarks diag.[mu, mc, mt,· · · mX],
diag.[md, ms, mb,· · · , mY ] and a matrix UCKMN, which are determined partly by experi-
mental measurements as input parameters

it is necessary to chose some inputs.

Note that above ZU , ZD, UU , UD are unitary matrices, but (UCKM)3×3 is not an ordinary
CKM matrix VCKM which is non-unitary in this case. Detailed dicussion will be shown in

the following section.

What we need to do for the next is to generate a unitary matrix UD. In the similar way

we denote UD as

UD = 


UDA UDB

UD0 UDN N

.




Both sides of Eq. (7) times the matrix UD, we can get

MAUDA + MBUD0 MAUDB + MBUDN N

MC UD0

MCUDN N

MU DUD = 

= (cid:16)ZU M D

D(cid:17) .
U UCKMN + ZDM D

(11)

(12)




From above equation, we can get the last line of UD simply by inputting M D

U , M D

U , UCKMN

and random ZU and ZD:

U UCKMN + ZDM D

(cid:16)ZU M D

D(cid:17)last line

= (cid:18) MC UD0 MCUDN N (cid:19)

= MC UDN ,

where

UDN = (cid:18) UDN 1 UDN 2 · · · UDN N (cid:19)

(13)

(14)

is a unit vector in N dimension.

Next we use the unit vector to generate total UD. Since MA and MB are random matrix,

UD can be random too. The unit vector UDN −1 of UD can be determined as

UDN −1 = (cid:18) −

U ∗

√|UDN 1|2+|UDN 2|2

DN 2

DN 1

U ∗

√|UDN 1|2+|UDN 2|2 0 · · · 0 (cid:19) .

(15)

It is clear that the vector is orthogonal to UDN and normalized to 1. Then we use the ﬁrst

three elements of UDN and UDN −1 to generate UDN −2: Normalize the algebraic comple-
ments of ﬁrst line of the 3 × 3 matrix. Step by step, we can ﬁnally get (UD1, UD2, · · ·,

From above steps, we can see that (UD1, UD2, · · ·, UDN −1) can be rotated into any other
orthogonal N − 1 vectors to construct random matrix MA and MB, only UDN must be kept
unchanged. Therefore, a general unitary matrix can be realized by timesing a unitary N ×N
matrix UR,

UD = URU S

D = 


URN −1 0

in which URN −1 is a (N − 1) × (N − 1) unitary matrix. We ﬁnish the work by

At this stage, we would like to summarize our method here

• Step 1: Chose (mu, mc, mt,· · · , mX , md, ms, mb,· · · , mY ) and UCKMN and generate ran-

dom unitary matrices ZU and ZD as the inputs for the model;

• Step 2: Determine the last line of matrix ZU M D

U UCKMN + ZDM D

D as

MC (cid:18) UDN 1 UDN 2 · · · UDN N (cid:19)

(21)

and normalize it into a unit vector UDN .

• Step 3: Use the unit vector UDN to generate other N − 1 unitary vectors (UD1, UD2,

· · ·, UDN −1), and form a special U S

D = (cid:18) UD1 · · · UDN −2 UDN −1 UDN (cid:19)T

• Step 4: Generate a N − 1 unitary matrix URN −1 to form a unitary matrix UR which

is

UR = 


then, a general UD is obtained by

URN −1 0



UD = URU S

• Step 5: Use these equations

(23)

(24)

(25)

to get the inputs for the ﬂavor physics.

We can see that by this trick we can skip the inputs of the bilinear mass terms M V

N i. In

physical analysis, the mass of eigen states mX, Y in the VLP models are inputs freely. ZU

and ZD can be generated randomly, UU and UD can also be scanned the most generally if we

vary UR randomly. Thus the method can do the most general scan in the parameter space

of mass matrices in the models with VLPs for the numerical studies, which will be shown

in the following section.

III. B → Xsγ PROCESS IN EXTENSION OF THE SM WITH ONE VECTOR LIKE
QUARK DOUBLET

A. The standard model with vector like quarks

As an application of the method,

in this section we study the VLP contribution to
B → Xsγ in a very simple VLP extension of SM for the demonstration. In the Tab. I, we
list the gauge symmetry of the matter multiplates in which the ﬁrst two queues show the

quarks in the SM and the last two queues show the VLPs with the anti-gauge symmetry.

Note that we ignore partners of the last two queues whose gauge symmetry are exactly

the same as the ﬁrst two queues of the SM. As talked in the introduction, these VLPs can

be heavy naturally. Since gauge symmetry of Higgs H = (h+, h0)T is (1, 2, 1/2), the

lagrangian for two quarks of the model is written as:

L = Yd ¯QHdR + Yu ¯Q · ¯HuR + YV u ¯VQH ¯VuL + YV d ¯VQ · ¯H ¯VdL

+MQVq · Q + Mu ¯VuLuR + Md ¯VdLdR + h.c.,

(26)

in which A· B = ǫijAiBj. The ﬁrst line of the lagrangian is Yukawa terms, the second line is
the bilinear terms. Note that Yu, Yd are 3× 3 matrix, without the bilinear terms, the model
will be almost the same as the fourth generation standard model (SM4).

After the electro-weak symmetry breaking, we can get the mass matrices of up and down

quarks in the basis of (u, c, t, Vu) and (d, s, b, Vd):

where v is the VEV for H. The ﬁrst three elements of last line of the matrices have the

same parameter, making the scan of the parameter space very diﬃcult. These two matrices

can be diagonalized by unitary matrices U and Z,

Z †

uMU Uu = diag.[mu, mc, mt, mX],

Z †

dMDUd = diag.[md, ms, mb, mY ].

Product of the two matrices is denoted as

UCKM4 = U †

(28)

(29)

which is unitary. We stress that the trick we introduced in the above section seems to

just give us a numerical tool for quark masses and some quark mixing matrices, but it is

important in studying the ﬂavor physics in such models.

Note that U(1)EM interaction is not changed by the VLPs, thus the vertices of photon and

quarks are still the same as those in the SM. From the above mass matrices and Feynman

rules, we can see that the model has two points to be explored:

• The CKM matrix is got from the W + ¯uidj vertex in Eq. (32)
CKM4 − U ∗4i

V ij
CKM4 =

u U mj

Xm=1

which is non-unitary. This is the key diﬀerence between VLP models and the SM4.

Nevertheless, the loop-level ﬂavor change neutral current (FCNC) will be changed by
the Yukawa interactions, then the prediction of process B → Xsγ may be changed
signiﬁcantly.

• The last terms in Eqs.(32)-(36), which we call the “tail terms”, violate the gauge
universality of fermions and cause tree-level FCNC processes induced by the processes
such as b → sℓ+ℓ−, then the constraints on the parameter space need to be explored.

B. Enhancement in b → s transition

In this subsection we will focus attention on VLP contributions to rare B decay B →
Xsγ. The starting point for rare B decays is the determination of the low-energy eﬀective

Hamiltonian obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom in the theory. For
b → s transition, this can be written as

W and the loop function A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x), E(x) are listed in the

appendix. The ﬁrst two lines are the similar contribution as in the SM, while the last lines

are the terms come form the tail terms. The terms with 1/mb is extracted to compose the
operator O7. Note that there are two diﬀerences in the calculation of B → Xsγ processes.
One is the tail terms of gauge or Yukawa interactions, another one is the new type of Yukawa

interactions listed in Eqs. (33, 34) which can not be written into the simple form in the SM

such as

(40)

In the model with three generation quarks, the CKM matrix unitarity is already used

in the calculations of the loop-level FCNC induced rare B decays. For consistency,

in

numerical analysis the constraints on CKM matrix element measurements are not from

processes occurred at loop level, such as rare B decays, but from tree-level processes shown
in Table II [10, 11]. Note that we use the unitarity of 3 × 3 CKM matrix to get the Vtd,
Vts since there are no tree level measurement of these two values. With this inputs in hand,

the ﬁrst task is to check the scale of the mass parameter of model, such as MQ, mX , mY .
From the Z¯bb vertexes in Eq. (35) and Eq. (36), we can see that in order to keep gauge

universality of quarks, the tail terms in the Feynman rules must be much smaller than the
i=1,2,3 ≪ sin2 θW . Thus in the numerical studies we

Note that though these elements are greater than λ3 (parameter in the Wolfenstein param-
eterization [12]), they are much smaller than the product of V †

CKM3VCKM3 (almost equals

1), thus the requirements are suitable for indicating the contraints from the deviation from

unitarity.

Since the scanning in the parameter space is freely, we set mX = 1172GeV and scan mY

in the range of (4.2, 1004)GeV, and Zu,d, Uu,d randomly (ignoring the CP phases). MV is

11

deﬁned by

MV = max(|M 1

Q|, |M 2

Q|, |M 3

Q|).

(42)

The result for MV versus MY is shown in the FIG. 1 which checks the mass input of vector

doublet. We can see that MV increases as mY growing up. However MV is much smaller

than mX and mY . Small mixings lead to parameter MQ which determine the mixing between

SM quarks and vector like quarks are also suppressed. This is in agreement with that the

deviation from unitarity is suppressed by the ratio m/mX,Y where m denotes generically the

standard quark masses, which is a typical result of VLP models. [13–17]

The second task is to check the VLP contribution to B → Xsγ. We ﬁnd the Wilson
coeﬃcient of FCNC operator O7 is not so suppressed as the mixing, The new contributions,

from the terms of the last line in Eq.(39) are suppressed by the mixing, whereas the terms

of ﬁrst line are almost the same as the SM. The enhancement comes mainly from the
gG
R(4, 3)/mb terms which are got from the Goldstone loop in b → s transition. In order to
show the enhancement clearly, we chose the coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst term in the second line

in which K2 denotes the deviation from the unitarity of 3 × 3 CKM matrix, while K1 shows
the enhancement of the contribution from vector like particles. Note that the factor K1 will

be changed to exactly K2 in case of the SM4. Results are shown in the FIG 2 in which the

left panel shows K1 and K2 versus MV while the right panel shows C7 versus K1. From

the left panel, we can see that though K2 increase as MV increases, it is still much smaller
than VtbV ∗
ts, implying that deviation of unitarity are negligible. However the factor K1 can
be enhanced up to order O(1) by the increase of MV . From the right panel, we can see
that K1 enhances C7 up to a value much larger that the result of the SM. The reason for

the enhancement mainly comes from the new type of Yukawa couplings. Combining of Eqs.

(28, 33, 34), one can get similar form compared with the SM4

The branching ratio as a function of mV is shown in FIG. 3, from which we can see
that Br(B → Xsγ) can be enhanced much greater than the experiment bound. Then the
measurements of FCNC process can give a stringent constraint on the vector like quark

model, especially when the masses of vector quark are much greater than the electro-weak

scale. A few remarks should be addressed:

FIG. 4: Enhancement factor and deviation form unitarity versus mX.

• There is one point of view on the unitarity of the CKM matrix which is that the 3× 3
ordinary quark mixing matrix is regarded as nearly unitary, deviation from unitarity

is suppressed by heavy particle in the new physics beyond the SM. In other word, one

admits that the extended CKM matrix elements exist, they approach to zero while

mass scale of the new physics approaches to inﬁnity. All the new physical eﬀects should
decouple from the ﬂavor sector and what should be checked is that if 3 × 3 unitariry
is consistent in all kinds of ﬂavor processes.

• Another point of view is that, as in the SM case, the 3×3 ordinary quark mixing matrix
elements are only extracted by experiments in the measurements of tree and loop level

precesses. The unitarity should be checked, experiment measurements on the elements

of matrix can be used as the constraints to the new physics beyond the SM. In the

numerical analysis, the elements of CKM matrix are regarded as inputs. Thus what

should be done is to scan the parameter space generally under these constraints, no
prejudice should be imposed. Then the enhancement eﬀect in B → Xsγ will be more
clear.

FIG. 3 shows a enhanced eﬀect of the VLPs. Such eﬀect can be seen in FIG. 4 in which

the left panel shows the enhancement factor K1 versus mX while the right panel shows K2

versus mX. From the right panel we can see that deviation from unitarity are very small and

15

almost irrelevant with mX since we are doing a general scan of Zu,d and Uu,d. However as we
see from the left panel, as mX increases up, Br(B → Xsγ) measurement will constrain the
enhancement factor and then constrain the input parameter of mX . In all, the enhancement

can be summarized as that when mass of vector like particle increases up, it will increase

the mass parameter mV thus give an enhancement factor under very small deviation from

unitarity. This should be a special point when we do the study on the vector like quark

models.

IV. SUMMARY

In the model with vector doublets, there exist bilinear terms in the lagrangian, making

the general scan of the Yukawa coupling very diﬃcult. In this paper, we show a trick to

deal with the scan. Our scan method are exactly and the more eﬃcient. We use the trick

to study a very simple extension of the SM with vector like quarks. We studied one of the
most important rare B decay (B → Xsγ) process in which we found that even the deviations
from the unitarity of quark mixing matrix are small, the enhancement to rare B decay from

VLPs are still signiﬁcant. The enhanced eﬀect is an important feature in the vector like

particle model. The studies on other rare B decays will appear in the future work.
