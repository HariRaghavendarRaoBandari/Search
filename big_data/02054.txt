Abstract

The quantum transport properties of graphene and monolayer M oS2 superconductor heterostruc-
tures has been of considerable importance in the recent few years. Layered nature of molybdenum
disulﬁde permits the superconducting correlation induction. Moreover, peculiar dynamical features
of monolayer M oS2, such as valence band spin-splitting in the nondegenerate K and K ′ valleys
originated from strong spin-orbit coupling, and considerable direct band gap can make it potentially
a useful material for electronics applications. Using the Dirac-like Hamiltonian of M oS2 with tak-
ing into account the related mass asymmetry and topological contributions, we investigate the effect
of spin-triplet p-wave pairing symmetry on the superconducting excitations, resulting in Andreev
reﬂection process and Andreev bound state in the corresponding normal-superconductor (NS) and
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) structures, respectively. We study how the resulting
subgap conductance and Josephson current are affected by the particular symmetry of order param-
eter. The signature of px-wave symmetry is found to decline the subgap superconducting energy
excitations and, consequently, slightly suppress the Andreev reﬂection in the case of p-doped S re-
gion. The essential dynamical parameters λ and β of M oS2 have signiﬁcant effect on the both
tunneling conductance and Josephson current. Particularly, the considered p-wave symmetry in the
superconducting bound energies may feature the zero energy states at the interfaces. The critical
current oscillations as a function of length of junction are obtained in the p-doped S region.

1 INTRODUCTION

The electron-like and hole-like quasiparticle excitations in the proximity superconducting two-dimensional
(2D) materials, such as graphene [1, 2] and monolayer molybdenum disulﬁde (ML-MDS) [3, 4, 5] have
triggered a massive interest in the related normal metal-superconductor and also Josephson junctions over
the last few years. The role of various unconventional superconductor pairing symmetries in the transport
properties of 2D structures (with graphene) consisting of relativistic charge carriers has been investigated
by several authors (see, Refs. [6, 7]) in the recent years, following the premier work of Beenakker [8, 9],
which gave rise to discover specular Andreev reﬂection (AR) process. It has experimentally been shown
that superconductivity may be induced by means of the proximity effect by placing a superconducting
electrode near a graphene layer [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] or monolayer M oS2 [15, 16, 17, 18]. In addi-
tion to proximity inducing conventional s-wave pairing, in principle, the particular lattice symmetry of
graphene and ML-MDS (honeycomb with six Dirac points at the Brillouin zone) permits unconventional
order parameters induction, such as spin-singlet d-wave or spin-triplet p-wave symmetries characterized
by non-zero angular momentum of pair l = 2 and l = 1, respectively. The p-wave pairing has experi-
mentally been observed in electronic system Sr2RuO4 indicating that its superconducting state has odd
parity, breaks time-reversal symmetry and is spin-triplet [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Due to spontaneous
time-reversal symmetry breaking in triplet pairing, the several anomalous transport phenomena, such
as the anomalous Hall effect, polar Kerr effect for microwave radiation, anomalous Hall thermal con-
ductivity, and anomalous photo and acousto-galvanic effects can be observed in the absence of external
magnetic ﬁelds [25, 26, 27]. Very recently, some authors have also explored the chiral p-wave pairing
in the various systems leading to anomalous transport phenomena and surface states [27, 28]. Moreover,
it has been shown that the Majorana bands can be appeared in the vortex state of a chiral p-wave su-
perconductor [29]. Triplet pairing may also give rise to suppress the superconducting surface states in
topological insulators [30, 31, 32, 33, 34].

So far in the literature, unconventional d- and p-wave order parameter has much been studied in
graphene, whereas a little attention has been paid to how unconventional pairing in monolayer M oS2
inﬂuences the transport properties of related structures. Due to intrinsic massive Dirac gap (direct band
gap of about 1.9 eV ), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) caused by dichalcogenide heavy transition metal
atom and resulting two nondegenerate K and K ′ valleys relative to spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles
at the valence band [35, 36, 37, 38, 39] (valley-contrasting spin-splitting 0.1 − 0.5 eV [3]) ML-MDS
may exhibit dynamically new behaviors in the Andreev process [40, 41] and superconducting Andreev
states [42] at the interface of a normal-superconductor.

In addition above dynamical peculiar properties of M oS2, its layered structure, chemical stability,
and relatively high mobility (room temperature mobility over 200 cm2/V s) can make it potentially a use-
ful material for electronics applications [5, 43, 44, 45, 46]. The spin-valve effect in proximity-induced
ferromagnetic M oS2 may result in a valley-spin-resolved conductance [47, 48, 49], which is considered
as an essential feature for valleytronic devices [39, 50, 51]. Analogous to graphene, there is a valley
index τ = ±1, which is robust against scattering by smooth deformations and long wavelength pho-
tons due to a large valley splitting. In this paper, we analytically investigate the signature of px-wave
and chiral px + ipy-wave symmetry in low-energy dispersions of Dirac-like charge carriers of ML-MDS.
Electron-hole exchange at the interface of a normal-superconductor in quasiparticle excitations below su-
perconducting gap leading to AR, and Andreev bound state (ABS) between two superconducting regions
separated by a weak-link normal section can be affected by the off-diagonal elements of Bogoliubov-de
Gennes gap matrix. The spin-triplet superconducting quasiparticle excitations in M oS2 are found to play
a crucial role in AR process, since the superconducting gap can be renormalized by electron-hole wave
vector or as well chemical potential. Furthermore, the AR process is believed to be spin-valley polarized
due to the valley-contrasting spin-splitting in the valence band and, indeed, depend on the magnitude of
the chemical potential. Remarkably, the electron-hole difference mass α and topological β terms [52] are
explicitly taken into the Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes (DBdG) M oS2 Hamiltonian, and thier contribu-
tion in superconductor electron-hole wavevector ke(h)
gives rise to signiﬁcantly change the resulting AR
and ABS.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the analytical solutions of the ML-MDS
DBdG equation with p-wave order parameter in order to obtain the exact expressions of dispersion en-
ergy, and corresponding Dirac spinors. We also represent the normal and Andreev reﬂection coefﬁcients
and Andreev bound state in the related NS and SNS junctions, respectively. The numerical results of
subgap conductance and Josephson current are presented in Sec. 3 with a discussion of the main charac-
teristics of systems. Finally, a brief conclusion is given in Sec. 4.

2 THEORETICAL FORMALISM
2.1 Effective Hamiltonian
The Brillouin zone of monolayer M oS2 is hexagonal and around the edges of this zone, the low energy
fermionic excitations behave as massive Dirac particles. The starting point for study their behavior is
the tight-binding Hamiltonian. In addition to symmetry of the lattice, it is essential to consider the local
atomic orbital symmetries. The minimum of conduction band is mainly formed from dz2 orbitals, and
valence band maximum is constructed from orbitals dx2−y2, dxy of M o atom with mixing from px, py
orbitals of S atom in both cases. The full Hamiltonian for an arbitrary electron, labeled by the integer σ,
that is included the possibility for symmetry adapted states and nearest neighbor hopping terms takes the
form:

H =Xσij h−µa

Here a and b(b′) indicate the second quantized fermion operators on the M o and S atoms in the up(down)
layer, respectively. The indices i and j show the orbital degree of freedom labeled as {1, 2, 3} ≡
′} ≡ {px + ipy, px − ipy} for M o and S atoms, sub-
(cid:8)dz2, dx2−y2 + idxy, dx2−y2 − idxy(cid:9) and {1
, 2
sequently. Therefore the matrices µa, µb, µb
and tσρ,ij are responsible for the on-site energies of M o
and S atoms and hopping between different neighboring sites in the space of different orbitals, respec-
tively. Introducing the Slater-Koster method, the Hamiltonian density and overlap can be obtained [53].
To complete tight-binding Hamiltonian, it is necessary to add spin-orbit interaction in the model which
causes spin-valley coupling in the valence band of ML-MDS. The most important contribution of this
interaction is relevant to heavy metal M o atoms. We deﬁne the Fourier transform of fermionic ﬁeld

This tight-binding model leads to calculate the effective electron and hole masses, energy gap, and va-
lence band edges. This model was ﬁrstly presented by Di Xiao et al. [39], and modiﬁed by Rostami et
al. [52] to obtain the explicit form of effective Hamiltonian for ML-MDS. Using the Lowdin partitioning
method [54], the ﬁnal result for effective low-energy two band continuum Hamiltonian governing the
conduction and valence bands around the K and K

where στ = (τ σx, σy) are the Pauli matrices. The valley index τ = ±1 denotes the K and K ′ valleys. ∆
is the direct band gap, λ ≈ 0.08 eV [55] and vF ≈ 0.53 × 106 ms−1 denote the spin-orbit coupling and
Fermi velocity, respectively. The bare electron mass is m0, and two numeric topological parameters are
evaluated by α = m0/m+ and β = m0/m−−8m0v2
F /(∆−λ), where m± = memh/(mh±me). These
band parameters originated from the difference between electron and hole masses (α) and topological
characteristics (β) have the values 0.43 and 2.21 [56], respectively.

In proximity-induced superconducting M oS2 case, the superconducting generalization of modiﬁed
Dirac Hamiltonian can be written on the ML-MDS, including the pairing potential. In the relativistic case,
Cooper pairing takes place between single particle states, which are constructed by application of the
time reversal, parity and charge conjugation operators. The possible pairing states can be characterized
as singlet or triplet order parameters. The superconducting order parameter is given by a function of spin
(s, s′) and momentum (k,−k). Obviously, the spatial part of triplet order parameter is an odd function
under exchange of the two particles, while the spin part is even. For a spin triplet symmetry the order
parameter is expressed using the d-vector as:

∆s,s′ (k) = (d(k) · τ )iτy,

(3)

where d(k) and τ and τy are an odd-parity function of k and Pauli matrices, which describe the real
electron spin, respectively. The direction of the d-vector is perpendicular to the total spin S of a Cooper
pair. This order symmetry is off-diagonal, which differs from our previous work [41]. Without loss of
generality, let us consider the case of d(k) = ∆S(k)ˆz, which means k⊥S. The symmetry of the lattice
plays, of course, a central role for k-dependency of d. In ML-MDS, the promising pairing symmetry is
px and chiral px + ipy-wave [57]. The superconducting potential interacting with lattice is written in the
band picture as follows:

where V s
k parameterizes the interaction strength of electrons, which can be determined according to the
point group symmetry of M oS2. Using the Taylor expansion around Dirac points, the low-energy limit of

then reads:

υ = ±1 distinguishes between the conduction and valence bands. Note that, the superconducting order
parameter ∆S(k) is renormalized by chemical potential µs, and also it appears as an ordinary gap. This
electron-hole superconducting excitation is qualitatively different from that obtained for conventional
singlet superconductivity [41] , so that it seems to remain semi-gapless. The mean-ﬁeld conditions are
satisﬁed as long as ∆S ≪ µs. So, at this stage, it is appropriate to insert this restriction, which will
be used in throughout this paper.

obtain the wave function for superconductor region. We calculate the relevant electron-hole Dirac spinor,
that is only valid for the spin triplet superconductivity. The wavefunctions, which includes a contribution
from both electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles are found as:

2.2 Scattering process in NS junction
In this section, we will focus on the effect of induced spin-triplet p-wave symmetry on the transport prop-
erties of NS structure deposited on top of a ML-MDS. To this end, we assume that the superconducting
region is located at x > 0 and employ a scattering process follows from the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk
(BTK) formula [58]. In the normal region (x < 0), we have ∆S(k) = 0, and an incident electron with
energy excitation ǫN and transverse wave vector ky has two possible fates upon scattering, reﬂection
as an electron or Andreev reﬂection as a hole. The Andreev reﬂection is the process that determines the
conductance of the interface at bias voltage below the superconducting gap, because the incident electron
can not transmit into the superconductor. We know that the superconducting pair potential couples an
electron of spin s from the valley τ with a hole of spin −s from the valley −τ . This spin-valley coupling
is considered in all the next calculations. At bias voltage above the superconducting gap, Andreev reﬂec-
tion is obviously suppressed, since direct tunneling into the superconductor is now possible. In fact, the
unusual electronic properties of graphene leads to have the possibility of specular Andreev reﬂection. At
the similar ML-MDS-based interface, retro Andreev reﬂection can happen for subgap energies, since the
direct band gap is too large to occur the specular Andreev reﬂection.
Having established the states that participate in the scattering, the total wave function for a right-
moving electron with angle of incidence θe, a left-moving electron by the substitution θe → π − θe and
a left-moving hole by angle of reﬂection θh may then be written as

ing coefﬁcients, respectively. The normalization factor Ne(h) ensure that the quasiparticle current density
of states is the same. The charge and current density of quasiparticles may be deﬁned by nonrelativistic
and relativistic terms based on the Lorentz covariance continuity equation. Using the modiﬁed Dirac
Hamiltonian, the normalization factors result in:

Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the normal region provides the energy eigenvalue for electron (relative
. The ± refers to the excitations in the con-
duction and valence bands. The nonconserved component of the momentum kx = |k| cos θe can be ac-
quired from this eigenstates. It is instructive to consider the effect of Fermi vector mismatch on Andreev
reﬂection amplitude. To explore how the Fermi vector mismatch inﬂuences the scattering processes, the
Fermi momentum in the normal and superconducting part of system may be controlled by means of a
chemical potential. The strategy for calculating the scattering coefﬁcients in the junction is to match the
wave functions in normal and superconductor regions, ψN = ψS at x = 0, where ψS = teψe

The coefﬁcients te and th correspond to the transmission of electron and hole quasiparticle, respectively.
The four scattering amplitudes together form the system of equations where we deﬁne

and the analytical expression of 4×4 matrix Ξ (given explicitly in the Appendix A) is obtained by solving
the boundary condition. We ﬁnd the following solution for the normal and Andreev reﬂection coefﬁcients

We will verify that the dispersion energy for triplet pairing symmetry have anomalous properties. Thus,
the results for scattering amplitudes exhibit qualitatively distinct behavior. One obviously veriﬁes that
Andreev reﬂection may be slightly suppressed in the presence of triplet superconducting gap. Here, the
order parameter may written as ∆S(k) = ∆S cos θs for px-wave and ∆Seiθs for chiral px + ipy-wave
symmetries.

integration in Eq. (10) needs to determine based on the fact that the incidence angle of electron-hole at
the interface may be less than π/2 in the two N and S regions.

2.3 SNS Josephson junction
We now proceed to study the Andreev bound states and current-phase relation in a ML-MDS Josephson
junction, where the normal region is extended from x = 0 to x = d. ML-MDS is covered by supercon-
ducting electrodes in the regions x > d and x < 0. At a superconductor surface, electrons(holes) are
reﬂected as holes(electrons), and their energy lies within the superconducting energy gap. In Josephson
junction, the overlap of the wavefunctions of the surface states builds up the ABS, which play an essential
role in Josephson transport. The electron and hole wave function at a SN interface are globally coupled
by a scattering matrix.

Firstly, we obtain the energy spectrum for the ABSs in the normal region by matching the wave
functions at the two interfaces, i.e. ψL
S at x = d. The left and right
superconductor wavefunctions ψL
S obey generally from the Eq. (6) for left-right moving electron
and hole. The wave function in N region is a superposition of right and left moving electrons and holes
due to Andreev reﬂection process. Proceeding the same procedure in the previous section, we can ﬁnd
the following system of equations

where Ξ′ is a 8×8 matrix of coefﬁcient given explicitly in the Appendix B. Subsequently, the ABS
carrying the Josephson current in the normal region can be obtain from nontrivial solution for the Eq.
(11). These bound state energies are actually expressed in terms of macroscopic phase difference (∆ϕ =
ϕR − ϕL) between the left and right superconducting sections:

Ω = 2hsin2 kxd (Ae sin θe sin θs − 1)2 + cos2 kxd (Ae cos θe cos θs)2i .

The analytical progress can be made in the limit of thin and strong barrier, which the barrier strength
parameter is then deﬁned as Z = kxd. Otherwise, the results of analytical calculations can be presented
as a function of length of junction. In short junction limit, the length of the junction is smaller than the
superconducting coherence length ξ = vF /∆S.

The Josephson current-phase relation may now be computed via the standard expression

valley degeneracy.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Andreev process
In this section, we will analyze in detail the dynamical transport properties of hybrid structure deposited
on top of a ML-MDS in order to investigate how the triplet p-wave superconductivity can affect the An-
dreev process and resulting subgap conductance. The M oS2 superconducting electron-hole excitations
of Eq. (5) is qualitatively different from that in s-wave case (see, Eq. (4) in Ref. [41]). Particularly, we
demonstrate this quantity in Figs. 1(a) and (b), where the valence band energy with ﬁxed spin polariza-
tion represents the superconducting subgap. The Fermi wave vector and also electron-hole branches (the
electron branch for |k| > kF , and the hole branch for |k| < kF ) are shifted by the essential features of
monolayer M oS2 Hamiltonian. The magnitude of superconducting order parameter ∆S is now renormal-
ized by the coefﬁcient η2, which contains the dynamical characteristic of ML-MDS, and also chemical
potential. To clearly see this feature, we take the net value of pair potential ∆S = 0.1 eV , although we

6

will not further need to use this value in the next calculations, since superconducting excitation energy ǫ
may necessarily be normalized by pair potential ∆S.

For actual case of ML-MDS, which the asymmetry mass term α originated from electron-hole dif-
ference mass and topological β term are taken into Hamiltonian, the superconductor subgap is reduced
to a value ∼ 0.06 eV (see the black line in Fig. 1(a)). This, therefore, can lead to suppress the AR. It is
seen that the strong SOC in M oS2 may enhance the AR, while the topological term β will give rise to
more suppression of AR at the NS interface. The mass-related parameter α has no effect on the valence
band excitation. These features are presented in Fig. 1(b).

Based on above triplet superconductor valence band energy behavior, the resulted Andreev and nor-
mal reﬂections are demonstrated in Fig. 2(a) and (b) at zero energy ǫ/∆S = 0, where N region is
necessarily p-doped. The S region is taken to be p-doped, µn = µs = −0.96 eV in Fig. 2(a). In this
condition, the suppression of AR is signiﬁcant, so that the maximum suppressed AR happens in the ab-
sence of SOC, and as resulted from excitation energy curve, the AR becomes a considerable value for the
case when β = 0 due to increasing the subgap energy. Furthermore, the probability density of reﬂections
is conserved, i. e. |rA|2 + |r|2 = 1, since we are in zero bias energy. To evaluate the n-doped S region
effect, we plot the µs dependence of the normal and AR probabilities versus electron angle of incidence,
as shown in Fig. 2(b), where the created Cooper pair in S region will be in the conduction band of super-
conductor M oS2. In this condition, we have Fermi wavevector mismatch (FVM) between reﬂected hole
in N region and corresponding transmitted electron to the S region, which means that µs ≫ ∆S. We see
that by increasing the chemical potential in S region the magnitude of AR probability has a noticeable
value for most incidence angles upto π/2, since we are in n-doped condition. Moreover, the normal
and Andreev reﬂections exhibit fundamentally new behavior when the bias energy is a non-zero value
ǫ/∆S 6= 0. To more clarify this situation, we calculate the Andreev resonance states at the interface
of NS junction by the fact that the normal reﬂection coefﬁcient may be equal to zero, which yields the
following solution:

ǫ = η∆S(θs)sgn(cid:20)tan(cid:18) 1

ω1(2) = η4(3)(cid:16)2τ Ae cos θe − η4(3)e(−)iτ θs eiγh(e)(cid:17) , ω3(4) = ω1 + (−)ω2.

To explore how doping in superconductor region inﬂuences this energies, we plot it versus the electron
incidence angle in N region. As seen in Fig. 3, the slope of resonance energy curves around normal
incidence angle varies very slightly with increasing the chemical potential of S region. Consequently, the
resonance energy contribution to the supercurrent conductance becomes considerable around θe = 0, and
the height of the zero-bias conductance is enhanced by increasing µs. In the p-doped case, the dispersion
is weak, so the bound state energy is close to zero ǫ = 0. Therefore, the doping of S region has the
important effect on the resonance states. It is seen that the behavior of resonance states around large
angles of incidence (θe > 0.1π) in the p-doped case is qualitatively different from the n-doped case,
so that, there is a zero slope of Andreev states at θe = π/2, and the magnitude of energies becomes a
maximum value.

Fig. 4 demonstrates the reﬂection probability curves in terms of bias energies below its normalized
magnitude for p-doped S region. Note that, the normalized bias is reduced from a magnitude ǫ = 1∆S
to ∼ 0.31∆S, when we take into the contribution of all dynamical parameters (λ, α, β) of ML-MDS.
However, the normal and Andreev reﬂections tend to a magnitude of unit and zero, respectively, when
the angle of incidence goes to the π/2. We have no reﬂections probability conservation (|rA|2 +|r|2 6= 1)
due to the non-zero bias energy. A sharp minimum peak is observed in AR at all incidence angles
0 ≤ θe ≤ π/2, so that the position of dip can be displaced by the bias limitation coefﬁcient η.
Importantly, in either p- or n-doped S region cases, the perfect AR process occurs with unit value
for normal incidence angle. The subgap conductance of NS structure resulted from Andreev process
is plotted in Fig. 5(a). For chemical potential of N region µn = −0.96 eV , the suppression of AR
results in a low conductance for p-doped S region (µs = −0.96 eV ), whereas we ﬁnd larger conductance
for n-doped condition at the bias energies 0.15 < ǫ/∆s < 0.25. Increasing the doping µs ≥ 3 eV
affects the superconducting subgap, and conductance curve strongly descends in high biases. A sharp
conductance dip close to zero relative to coefﬁcient η is obtained for all magnitude of chemical potential
in S region. The inﬂuence of dynamical characteristics of ML-MDS in conductance is presented in Fig.
5(b). As expected, the absence of topological term β results in higher conductance, and mass-related
term α has no substantial effect on the transport properties of structure. Also, in Fig. 5(b), one can
see the effect of SOC, where the zero dip of conductance appeared in p- and n-doped S region cases
(µn = −1 eV, µs = −1, 3 eV ) is displaced when the SOC vanishes λ = 0 eV . Indeed, spin-valley

7

coupling in the non-degenerate K and K ′ valleys and also valence band spin-splitting resulted from
strong SOC gives rise to decrease the conductance in p-doped case. When we neglect the above effects,
i.e. the SOC to be zero the conductance increases in the case of n-doped S region.

3.2 Andreev bound state
In order to study the effect of triplet superconductivity on the supercurrent passing through ML-MDS
SNS Josephson junction, we proceed to investigate the ABS given by the expression of Eq. (12). In
this equation, the electron angle of incidence in the normal region separated the two superconducting
regions yields θe = sin−1(ks/k sin θs), which corresponds to lower chemical potential (we may have, in
this case, the condition µn ≈ µs, due to the existence of direct energy gap in low-energy excitations of
ML-MDS). In the case of a thin and strong barrier for N region (µn ≫ µs), one can take the θe to be
zero and, therefore, a barrier strength parameter Z can be realized. Exploring the obtained bound state
of Eq. (12) reveals the fact that the slope of ABS curves (we do not present the related ﬁgure) at ∆ϕ = 0
and 2π. This is not a correct physical result indicating the non-zero (no ﬁnite) supercurrent in zero phase
difference. Such situation can be understood from the fact that the zero energy states (ZESs) may be
formed near the interfaces due to unconventional superconductivity, as shown in the similar situation in
Ref.
[59, 60]. Therefore, in what follows, we have to derive the new energy states corresponding to
ZESs, which, in general, can be given as:

ǫ(∆ϕ) = η∆S(θs)√

2 (cid:19),
E cos(cid:18) ∆ϕ

(14)

where

E =

e−iγe e−iγh cos2 θs cos2 θe

sin2 (kxd) (Ae sin θe sin θs − 1)2 + cos2 (kxd) (Ae cos θe cos θs)2 .

In fact, the px-wave symmetry satisﬁes the condition ∆S(θs) = −∆S(π−θs), which causes the existence
of ZESs. Also, we have the similar condition for chiral px + ipy-wave symmetry.
Figure 6 presents the ABS featuring ZESs for px-wave or chiral px + ipy-wave symmetries, when
µs = −1.1 eV and Z = 0.5π. As seen, the maximum slope of bound energies occurs in ∆ϕ = ±π,
whereas ∆ϕ = 0, ±2π results in ﬂat energy curve, which may correspond to 0 − π current-phase
relation. By increasing the quasiparticle incidence angle, the energy states remain gapless. We ﬁnd
that ﬂattening ABS in px-wave symmetry quickens rather than chiral px + ipy-wave. Remarkably, the
dynamical feature of M oS2 affects signiﬁcantly the ABS in a way that the effect of SOC (λ 6= 0)
enhances and topological term β 6= 0 reduces the ABS. The mass asymmetry term α has no further
effect. These features are demonstrated in Fig. 6. We also proceed to discuss the barrier strength
and quasiparticle angle of incidence dependence of energy states formed in N region, and especially
investigate how they vary from px-wave case to the chiral px + ipy-wave symmetry. Figs. 7(a) and
(b) show that the ABS corresponding to ZESs displays regular oscillations as a function of the barrier
strength in the case of µs ≫ ∆S and ∆ϕ = 0 or 2π. The peaks of oscillations for both cases of order
parameters are in Z = nπ (n is integer), so that, by increasing the incidence angle the magnitude of peaks
decreases in px-wave symmetry (Fig. 7(a)), while it is a constant value ∼ 0.47 in chiral px + ipy-wave
(Fig. 7(b)).
Finally, we consider the resulting current-phase relationship for triplet order parameter featuring
ZESs, in which the zero-temperature limit is assumed in all the following plots. In Figs. 8(a) and (b), we
plot the phase difference and barrier strength dependences of Josephson current for px and px + ipy-wave
symmetries when the p-doped S region is taken, µs = −1 eV . The abrupt crossover current at ∆ϕ = π
can be understood by ZESs feature of ABS. From px-wave to chiral px + ipy-wave, the magnitude of
current decreases, and its sign is changed, which can be justiﬁed by a factor of cos θs in the px-wave
case. The current shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of barrier strength Z, and its maximum
occurs in Z = nπ, according to the energy bound states. In order to see the effect of doping on the
critical current, we plot the width d of N region dependence of critical current for n-doped S region and
µn = −1.3 eV , in Fig. 9. Existence of FVM, in this case, causes to decline the maximum supercurrent
with a (d/ξ)−1 relationship. The case of p-doped S region (µs = −1.3 eV ), when the Fermi level lies
between the spin-split valence subband of M oS2 the Josephson current curve is presented to compare
with the n-doped case (see the black line in Fig. 9). Subsequently, the critical current exhibits oscillatory
function in terms of width d, where the oscillation-amplitude is considerably small. Indeed, the absence
of FVM between S and N regions is responsible to this behavior, which is shown in Fig. 10.

4 CONCLUSION

In summary, we have investigated the effect of proximity-induced spin triplet superconducting monolayer
molybdenum disulﬁde on the transport properties of normal-superconductor and superconductor-normal-
superconductor hybrid junctions. One of key ﬁndings of the present work is that the M oS2 supercon-
ducting electron-hole excitations remain semi-gapless. This feature has led to suppress more or less the
Andreev reﬂection in the case of p-doped S region, since the superconducting subgap weakens with a bias
limitation coefﬁcient η, which contains the dynamical characteristics of M oS2 such as mass asymmetry,
topological and spin-orbit coupling terms, and, of course, the chemical potential of each region. The
perfect AR has been found at normal incidence to the interface with both p and n-doped S region, and
AR enhances in n-doped case. The resulting Andreev conductance for p-doped S region has a low value,
while it considerably increases in the bias energies 0.15 < ǫ/∆S < 0.25 for n-doped case. On the other
hand, the Andreev bound state behavior as a function of phase difference between two superconducting
sections in Josephson junction reveals the formation of zero energy states at the interfaces, which can
be understood by the intrinsic feature of unconventional order parameters. We have obtained an abrupt
crossover current-phase relation curve. The critical current has been found to strongly depend on the
doping of S region. We have reported on critical current oscillations in terms of junction length in the
absence of Fermi wavevector mismatch. In the case of thin and strong barrier, the supercurrent exhibits
an oscillatory behavior versus barrier strength with a period of Z = nπ.
