Abstract

Free energy calculation is critical in predictive tasks such as protein folding, dock-
ing and design. However, rigorous calculation of free energy change is prohibitively
expensive in these practical applications. The minimum potential energy is therefore
widely utilized to approximate free energy. In this study, based on analysis of extensive
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a few native globular proteins, we
found that change of minimum and corresponding maximum potential energy terms
exhibit similar level of correlation with change of free energy. More importantly, we
demonstrated that change of span (maximum - minimum) of potential energy terms,
which engender negligible additional computational cost, exhibit considerably stronger
correlations with change of free energy than the corresponding change of minimum and
maximum potential energy terms. Therefore, potential energy span may serve as an
alternative eﬃcient approximate free energy proxy.

Minimum potential energy is widely utilized to approximate free energy. We found that
change of maximum potential energy from canonical distributions exhibit similar level of
correlation with change of free energy to that observed between change of minimum potential
energy and change of free energy. More importantly, change of span of potential energy
consistently and signiﬁcantly correlate better with free energy than change of both minimum
and maximum potential energy.

INTRODUCTION

Estimating free energy changes for macrostate pairs is essential in protein folding, dock-

ing and design.

In such tasks, one usually need to sample a large number of backbone

conformational macrostates and identify those with the lowest free energy. Rigorous free

energy calculation methods, such as those based on thermodynamic integration (TI) 1,2, free

energy perturbation (FEP) 3–5 and non-equilibrium work (NEW) 6–8, are not suitable due

to prohibitive computational cost1. As a necessary compromise, two types of approximate

methodologies, including a large number of scoring functions 9 and physics based methods

such as MM/P(G)BSA 10 and linear interaction energy (LIE) 11 model, have been devel-

oped and widely utilized. Despite its apparent caveat of neglecting entropic contributions,

the minimum potential energy (MiPE) approximation is popular for its great simplicity 12.

When sampling is carried out for a given macrostate, signiﬁcantly more information is pro-

duced in addition to MiPE. We are interested in extracting more information to improve

the MiPE approximation while retaining its attractive simplicity. To avoid entanglement

of errors caused by extent of sampling, quality of force ﬁelds and experimental measure-

ments, direct comparison between computation and experiments is avoided.

Instead, we

utilized suﬃciently well-converged molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, where

arbitrary macrostates may be constructed through partition of visited conﬁgurational space,

to evaluate quality of the MiPE approximation and explore possible improvement.

Based on the analysis of MD trajectories of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) generated

in canonical ensemble (see Methodology for details), we found that both change of MiPE and

maximum potential energy (MaPE) terms (hereafter denoted as ∆E ∗

min and ∆E ∗

max, ‘*’ is

1There are two major aspects for the cost. Firstly, each single calculation of free energy change between

two macrostates is expensive; Secondly, to evaluate n macrostates, these methods requires ∼ n2 calculations.

Suppose we have n macrostates {M S1, M S2, M S3, · · · , M Sn} to be evaluated for their relative free energy

via TI type of methods. If we calculate ∆F 12 (the free energy change when the system goes from macrostates

M S1 to M S2), ∆F 23, · · · , ∆F (n−1)n, and express ∆F 1n as the sum: ∆F 12 + ∆F 23 + · · · + ∆F (n−1)n, we

would have accumulation of error following a one-dimensional random walk, which is not bounded. To

prevent such unbounded propagation of error, pairwise calculations are necessary and the resulting number

of calculations increases from O(n) to O(n2)!

3

a wild card for “p”– protein self energy, “p-sv”–protein solvent interaction energy, “ppsv”–

the sum of the previous two terms and “tot”–the total potential energy of the simulated

molecular system) have similar level of overall correlations with change of free energy (∆F )

for corresponding macrostate pairs. More importantly, we found that change of span of

potential energy terms (∆E ∗

min)) correlate consistently and signiﬁcantly

span = ∆(E ∗

max − E ∗

better with change of free energy than change of both MiPE and MaPE terms. Analysis

of MD trajectory sets for two other globular proteins with diﬀerent folds and sizes revealed

similar trends. Therefore, we think it is likely that span of potential energy terms are

better free energy proxies than MiPE terms in globular proteins. Since calculating Espan

beyond MiPE engenders only an additional counter for MaPE and a subtraction operation,

an essentially negligible cost in both memory and wall-clock time, we expect Espan to be a

useful free energy proxy in high throughput estimation of free energy diﬀerences in proteins,

and possibly other complex biomolecular systems.

METHODOLOGY

HEWL trajectory set is based on the 200µs trajectory set reported previously 13, 20, 000

snapshots were taken from which to seed short trajectories, each 10-ps long and with 1000

snapshots recorded. The BPTI trajectory as reported in another study 14 was extended to

∼ 3.3µs, 6124 uniformly distributed snapshots were taken to seed short trajectories, each 10-

s long with 1000 snapshots recorded. The human sulfotransferase trajectory set was based

on the 2A1 + LCA system in another study 15, 3760 snapshots uniformly distributed in the

original trajectory set (collectively ∼ 1.8µs) were taken to seed 10-ps short trajectories, each

has 1000 snapshots recorded. Potential energy terms were calculated with the pairInteraction

option of NAMD 16. Macrostates were constructed by projection onto backbone dihedrals.

Speciﬁcally, for a given dihedral has an observed range [a, b], then 20 b−a
20

sized bins are

constructed. Alternatively, if a given dihedral has an observed range [0, a] and [b, 360], then

20 360+a−b

20

sized bins are constructed.

RESULTS

Correlations between change of MiPE terms and change of

free energy for HEWL

We ﬁrst need to construct macrostates for evaluating performance of MiPE approximation.

To this end, each backbone was utilized as an order parameter for projection and divided

into 20 equally sized windows (see Methodology for details), each of which is deﬁned as a

macrostate. Consequently there are 20 mutually exclusive and exhaustive macrostates, and

190 macrostate pairs associated with each backbone.

In a set of suﬃciently well converged MD trajectories, change of free energy upon tran-

sition from macrostates A to B may be calculated as:

∆F AB = kBT ln

snap

N A
N B

snap

(1)

with N A(B)

snap being observed number of snapshots in macrostate A(B), kB being Boltzmann

constant and T being the temperature. For each backbone dihedral, ∆F corresponds to each

of the 190 associated macrostate pairs was calculated with equation 1. We also calculated

corresponding change of MiPE terms, including ∆Ep

min, ∆Ep-sv

min , ∆Eppsv

min and ∆Etot

min. Linear

correlations between changes of these MiPE terms (∆E ∗

min) and corresponding changes of

free energy (∆F ) were analyzed. Such operation was repeated for all backbone dihedrals,

each of which corresponds to a unique way of macrostates deﬁnition (conﬁgurational space

partition). A summary of the results is presented in Fig. 1.

Diﬀerent change of MiPE terms exhibit comparable level of overall correlation with

change of free energy. The consistency among diﬀerent MiPE terms suggest strong cor-

relations between protein self-energy, protein-solvent interaction energy and solvent energy,

in agreement with our earlier analysis of correlations between these energetic terms 17. Never-

theless, strong correlations are not equivalence, and slight diﬀerences exist among examined

change of MiPE terms. To better characterize such diﬀerences, the cumulative probability

density (CPD) of the correlation coeﬃcients associated with individual macrostate-deﬁning

backbone dihedrals are plotted with respect to their absolute values and shown in Fig 2a.

5

Area under each of these curves indicate overall correlation between corresponding ∆Emin

term and ∆F . ∆Etot

min exhibit the strongest correlation with ∆F . For the remaining three

change of MiPE terms, ∆Ep

min . Additionally,

min perform slightly better than ∆Eppsv

min and Ep-sv

macrostates deﬁned by diﬀerent backbone dihedrals were pooled together (with 13104640

macrostate pairs in total) to perform an overall linear ﬁt, qualitatively similar relative cor-

relation with ∆F was observed for these change of MiPE terms ( see Fig. S2a, b, c, d).

Secondly, while consistently good correlations between change of MiPE terms and change of

free energy are observed when macrostates are deﬁned by projection onto backbone dihedral

angles in stable secondary structures and by projection onto some of backbone dihedrals in

loop regions, signiﬁcantly weaker correlations are observed when macrostates are deﬁned by

projection onto the remaining backbone dihedral angles in ﬂexible loop regions.

Correlations between change of MaPE terms and change of

free energy for HEWL

Boltzmann distribution states that microstates with higher potential energy have smaller

statistical weight (probability being observed). For macrostates with relatively higher ob-

served potential energy, an alternative perspective would be that there are more high energy

microstates in such macrostates. Therefore, higher observed potential energy qualitatively

indicates larger entropy in the corresponding potential energy range. Prompted by this

thought, we suspect that MaPE terms from canonical distributions might correlate with free

energy, especially when entropy in the relatively higher potential energy range is important.

We therefore analyzed correlations between change of MaPE terms with change of free energy

in a similar way. A summary of the results was shown in Fig. 3. Indeed, consistently good

correlations between ∆E ∗

max and ∆F are observed when macrostates are deﬁned by projec-

tion onto most of backbone dihedral angles. Signiﬁcantly weaker correlations are observed

for the same set of macrostate pairs where weaker correlations between ∆E ∗

min and ∆F are

observed. As one would intuitively expect, all ∆E ∗

max terms negatively correlate with ∆F .

The order of correlation strength among ∆E ∗

max terms and ∆F is slightly diﬀerent from that

6

observed for ∆E ∗

min (see Fig. 2a) and b)), with ∆Eppsv

max exhibiting the strongest correlation

with ∆F . Similar to analysis of ∆E ∗

min, macrostates deﬁned by diﬀerent backbone dihedrals

were pooled together (with 13104640 macrostate pairs in total) to perform an overall linear

ﬁt, the results were shown in the supporting Fig. S3.

Correlations between change of span of potential energy

terms and change of free energy for HEWL

The apparent caveat of the MiPE approximation is neglect of entropic contributions. Based

on the thought that MaPE terms, which are observed to correlate signiﬁcantly with free

energy, qualitatively reﬂect the entropic contributions in the high potential energy range, we

ﬁgure that combination of MiPE and MaPE terms might accommodate both energetic and

entropic contributions without increasing computational cost. Since change of MiPE terms

positively correlate with change of free energy (Fig. 1), and change of MaPE terms negatively

correlate with change of free energy (Fig. 3), ∆E ∗

span = ∆(E ∗

max − E ∗

min) are potentially

better free energy proxies than corresponding change of both MiPE and MaPE terms. We

calculated ∆E ∗

span and correlations of these terms with ∆F , and the results are presented

in Fig. 5. Firstly, all ∆E ∗

span terms indeed strongly correlate with ∆F , with ∆Etot

span and

∆Eppsv

span exhibit stronger correlations than ∆Ep

span and ∆Ep-sv

span (Fig.2)c. More importantly, as

suspected, ∆E ∗

span correlated with ∆F consistently and signiﬁcantly better than both ∆E ∗

min

and ∆E ∗

max, regardless of the speciﬁc dihedrals utilized to deﬁne macrostates and potential

energy components utilized (Fig. 4). Similar to analysis of ∆E ∗

min, macrostates deﬁned by

diﬀerent backbone dihedrals were pooled together (with 13104640 macrostate pairs in total)

to perform an overall linear ﬁt, the results were shown in the supporting Fig. S5.

Correlations between change of average potential energy

terms and change of free energy for HEWL

It is widely believed that macrostates with lower average potential energy are likely to have

lower free energy. Change of ensemble averaged potential energy term is essential when the

basic formula for change of free energy

∆F = ∆E − T ∆S

(2)

is utilized as in the case of MM/P(G)BSA. To test this intuitive belief, we calculated ∆E ∗

avg

(the subscript avg represents ensemble average based on MD trajectory set.) and correlations

of these terms with change of free energy were presented in Fig. 6. It is clear that change of

all average potential energy terms essentially have no signiﬁcant correlations with change of

free energy. This is mathematically a direct result of negative correlations between ∆E ∗

max

and ∆F and positive correlations between ∆E ∗

min and ∆F . The process of averaging is

essentially adding up two sides of a distribution and the opposing eﬀects of these two sides

cancel each other. The ﬁnding suggests that direct utilization of equation 2 requires accurate

estimation of ∆S, which is acknowledged as an extremely challenging task . It is suggested

that due to almost ubiquitous existence of entropy enthalpy compensation phenomenon 18,

straight forward calculation of change of free energy with equation 2 is likely to be unreliable.

An alternative perspective for explaining this observation is that a given average potential

energy may be obtained either from a sharply peaked narrow distribution or a ﬂat wide

distribution or anything in between. The observed strong correlations between ∆E ∗

span and

∆F is consistent with weak correlations between ∆E ∗

avg and ∆F . For ∆E ∗

min, ∆E ∗

max and

∆E ∗

span, the “tot” and “ppsv” terms exhibit stronger correlations with ∆F than “p” and

“p-sv” terms (Fig. 4a, b and c; Fig. S2). This makes intuitive sense since “tot” and “ppsv”

terms includes more potential energy components, all of which contribute to free energy.

The opposite is observed for ∆E ∗

avg (Fig. 2d). However, since all ∆E ∗

avg terms correlate

weakly with ∆F , the diﬀerence among them are likely not meaningful both theoretically

and practically.

8

DISCUSSION

For all potential energy terms (except E ∗

avg) analyzed, a consistent pattern is that for

macrostates deﬁned by projection onto some backbone dihedrals in loop regions, signiﬁ-

cantly weaker correlations are observed between ∆E ∗

span and ∆F than that

min, ∆E ∗

max, ∆E ∗

of macrostates deﬁned by all other backbone dihedrals. To identify cause of such diﬀerence in

correlations between change of potential energy terms and change of free energy, we divided

backbone dihedrals in loop region into three types. The ﬁrst type of dihedrals are those

utilized to deﬁne macrostates exhibiting strong linear correlations between ∆E ∗

min,max,span

and ∆F (with all three linear correlation coeﬃcients greater than 0.9, hereafter addressed

as strongly correlating loop dihedrals(SCLD)), and the second type are those utilized to

deﬁne macrostates exhibiting weak corresponding linear correlations (with all three lin-

ear correlation coeﬃcients smaller than 0.6, hereafter addressed as weakly correlating loop

dihedrals(WCLD)), the remaining are classiﬁed as moderately correlating loop dihedrals

(MCLD). Adjusted negative natural logarithm probability (see Fig. 7 for details), which is

eﬀectively free energy with the lowest point as the reference, for representative dihedrals of

both SCLDs and WCLDs were shown in Fig. 7.

It is immediately clear that high barriers dividing SCLD into local wells (Fig.7a, c, e, g).

For most WCLDs, there are no signiﬁcant free energy barriers at all (Fig. 7d, f, h and ψG16

in b). While φH15 in Fig. 7b) has one high free energy barrier, which does not hinder rapid

diﬀusion along the dihedral due to the fact that dihedrals are cyclic. Therefore, WCLDs

are essentially (nearly) freely rotating in the whole range, with time scales of diﬀusion along

these dihedrals being on nano-seconds or shorter as revealed by examination of original

MD trajectories. While transitions between local wells for SCLDs occur on sub-micron

seconds or longer than time scales. Physically, each macrostate deﬁned by projection onto

the slowest degrees of freedom (DOFs) (e.g. dihedrals with long average transition times

between diﬀerent torsional states) likely comprise a continuous region or a few discrete

regions in conﬁgurational space.

In contrast, each macrostate deﬁned by projection onto

very fast DOFs generally comprising a great number of discrete and distal fragments in

conﬁgurational space, and calculating change of free energy between such two “macrostates”

9

is both diﬃcult and meaningless in reality. Therefore, weak correlations observed between

change of potential energy terms ∆E ∗

min,max,span should not be a great concern for physically

well-deﬁned macrostates (continuous regions in conﬁgurational space). This fact, on the

other hand, remind us to be careful in deﬁning macrostates when exploring free energy

landscape of complex molecular systems.

For protein self energy, ∆Ep

min correlate slightly weaker than ∆Ep

max for large r, ∆Ep

min

correlate slightly stronger than ∆Ep

max for small r (Fig. 4a). For protein solvent interaction

energy, the opposite is true (Fig. 4b). For the sum of protein self energy and protein solvent

interaction energy, ∆Eppsv

min exhibits weaker correlation with ∆F than ∆Eppsv

max in the whole

range of r (Fig. 4c). Since MaPE terms, as brieﬂy discussed earlier, qualitatively correlate to

entropy in corresponding potential energy range, these observations suggest that for diﬀerent

potential energy terms, the relative importance of entropy is diﬀerent.

In simulation and design of complex molecular systems exempliﬁed by proteins, two

fundamental limitations are accuracy of interaction representations (quality of force ﬁelds

for classical systems) and sampling of the statistically signiﬁcant region in conﬁgurational

space. Scientists have been relentlessly working on these two fronts for decades with great

progresses. However, a more practical general principle, which is to only generate information

that is essential and utilize it to its full potential, has not attracted suﬃcient attention. In

regular protein docking, folding and design with the minimum potential energy utilized as

the free energy proxy, backbone conformational states are selected as target macrostates

ﬁrst, side chain packing is repetitively carried out for a predetermined number of cycles

and the minimum potential energy found is recorded to approximate free energy, and other

information generated is discarded completely. With the addition of a variable for storing

maximum potential energy and a subtraction operation to calculate corresponding span of

potential energy, the reliability of prediction may potentially be signiﬁcantly and consistently

improved (Fig.4).

It is hard to imagine that HEWL is an extremely special protein that has this unique

property, which is not true for all other proteins and other complex bimolecular systems. To

investigate general utility of potential energy span as a free energy proxy for other proteins,

similar analyses were conducted for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (see Fig. S3 and Fig.

10

S4) and human sulfotransferase (Fig. S5 and Fig. S6). As observed for HEWL, E ∗

span were

observed to correlate consistently better with ∆F than both E ∗

min and E ∗

max for these two

proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the observation is of general importance for proteins

and possibly for other complex biomolecular systems as well.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, based on the observation that change of MaPE terms exhibit similar level of

correlations with change of free energy to change of MiPE terms, we proposed and tested span

of potential energy as an approximate free energy proxy based on extensive MD trajectories of

HEWL, and found that span of potential energy terms perform consistently and signiﬁcantly

better than corresponding minimum potential energy terms. Similar results were observed

for two other diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the superiority of span of potential

energy as a free energy proxy to be of general importance for proteins and possibly other

complex biomolecular systems. It is important to note that additional computational cost

for obtaining span of potential energy is negligible.

Figure 7: Adjusted negative natural logarithm probability (∆(−lnP )) of the representative

SCLDs (a, c, e, g) and WCLDs (b, d, f, h), the identity of each plotted backbone dihedral

is labeled (e.g. φ19R). ∆(−lnP ) is obtained as follows, each dihedral is divided into 360

1◦ bins and their negative natural log probability calculated and adjusted by subtracting

the smallest value −lnPmin. Therefore, ∆(−lnP ) is relative free energy projected onto each

backbone dihedrals based on 1◦ bins.
