Abstract

At the LHC, the Littlest Higgs Model with T -parity is characterised by various production

channels.

If the T -odd quarks are heavier than the exotic partners of the W and the Z, then

associated production can be as important as the pair-production of the former. Studying both, we

look for ﬁnal states comprising at least one lepton, jets and missing transverse energy. We consider

all the SM processes that could conspire to contribute as background to our signals, and perform

a full detector level simulation of the signal and background to estimate the discovery potential at

the current run as well as at the scheduled upgrade of the LHC. We also show that, for one of the

channels, the reconstruction of two tagged b-jets at the Higgs mass (Mh = 125 GeV) provides us
with an unambiguous hint for this model.

Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides an admissible explanation for the electroweak

symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism that seems to be in accordance with all observations till date

including the electroweak precision tests. The discovery of the long sought Higgs boson at the Large

Hadron Collider (LHC) [1, 2] completes the search for its particle content, and the current level of

agreement of this particle’s couplings to the other SM particles is a strong argument in favour of the

model. In spite of such a triumph, the SM is beset with unanswerable problems, whose resolution

requires the introduction of physics beyond the domain of the SM. One such issue pertains to the

smallness of the Higgs mass, which is unexpected as there exists no symmetry within the SM that

would protect the Higgs mass from radiative corrections. This extremely ﬁne-tuned nature of the SM is

termed as the Naturalness Problem and many scenarios beyond the SM (BSM) such as supersymmetric

theories, extra dimensional models and little Higgs models have been proposed as solutions.

In the little Higgs models, the Higgs boson is realized as a pseudo Goldstone boson of a new global

symmetry group [3–5]. With the Higgs mass now being proportional to the extent of the soft breaking

of this symmetry, the relative lightness can, presumably, be protected. The minimal extension of the

SM based on the idea of little Higgs scenario is the Littlest Higgs model [6, 7], which is essentially a

non-linear sigma model with a global SU (5) symmetry that breaks down to SO(5) at some scale Λ
on account of a scalar ﬁeld vacuum expectation value f ≈ Λ/4π. A subgroup of the SU (5), namely
[SU (2)×U (1)]2, is gauged, and the breaking mechanism is such that the local symmetry spontaneously
breaks into its diagonal subgroup which is identiﬁed with the SM gauge group SU (2)L × U (1)Y .

Unlike in supersymmetric theories, the cancellation of the leading correction to the Higgs mass square
occurs here between contributions from particles of the same spin5. For example, the W/Z contribu-

tions are cancelled by those accruing from the extra gauge bosons. Similarly, it is the exotic partner

of the top quark that is responsible for cancelling the latter’s contribution. The collective symmetry

breaking mechanism ensures that no quadratic divergence enters in the Higgs mass before two loops.

Although, technically, the little Higgs models, unlike supersymmetry, are not natural (for the stabiliza-

tion of the scale Λ is not guaranteed and has to be ensured by other means), the inescapability of this

extra loop suppression ameliorates the ﬁne tuning to a great degree rendering it almost acceptable.

On the other hand, the very presence of these extra particles results in additional contributions to

the electroweak precision observables [8–14], and consistency with the same requires that the scale

f should be above a few TeVs, thereby introducing the ‘little hierarchy problem’. These constraints

can, however, be largely avoided with the introduction of a new discrete symmetry, namely ‘T -parity’,

under which all the SM particles are even while all the new particles are odd. This forbids the mixing

between the SM gauge bosons and the heavy T -odd gauge bosons at the tree-level, thereby preserving

the tree-level value of the electroweak ρ-parameter at unity [15]. The Littlest Higgs model with T -

parity (LHT) [16–20], thus, solves the little hierarchy problem and has the additional advantage that

the lightest T -odd particle (which naturally happens to be electrically neutral and color-singlet) can

be a good cold Dark Matter (DM) candidate [21–23].

The LHT model, like any other BSM scenarios also has interesting phenomenological implications

with its own set of non standard particles. In light of the Higgs discovery a detailed analysis of the

model has been considered at run-I of the LHC [24]. In this work, we investigate a few of the most

likely signatures of LHT that could be observed at the current run of LHC with

s = 13 TeV as

√

well as predictions for the possible upgrade to

s = 14 TeV. As the discrete T symmetry forbids

single production of any of the T -odd particles, they must be pair produced at the LHC. While the
pair production of T -odd gauge boson (W ±
h ) has been studied in Refs. [25–29], unless the Yukawa
couplings are very large, the production rates are expected to be higher for processes involving the

exotic quarks. Here, we consider the signals generated from the associated production of heavy T -odd

quarks with heavy T -odd gauge bosons. We eschew the simplistic possibility that the exotic quark

decays directly into its SM counterpart and the invisible Ah (relevant only for a limited part of the
parameter space and considered in Ref. [30]) and consider (the more prevalent and more complicated)

cascade decays instead. We concentrate on ﬁnal states—for LHC run II—comprising leptons and jets

accompanied by large missing transverse energy, while noting that the pair-production of the T -odd

quarks also contributes signiﬁcantly owing to their larger cross-sections. For a large part of the allowed

parameter space, the Zh boson dominantly decays to a Higgs boson and Ah. This, consequently, gives
rise to two b-tagged jets, thereby proﬀering the interesting possibility of reconstructing the Higgs mass

and validating the decay chain predicted by the model. Performing a detailed collider analysis while

taking all the relevant SM backgrounds into consideration, we explore the possibility of probing the

model parameter space at the current run of the LHC.

The paper is organized in the following manner: In Section 2, we begin with a brief description of the

LHT model. In Section 3, we describe our analysis strategy and explore the discovery possibilities at

the LHC run II. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize our ﬁndings and conclude.

2 The Littlest Higgs model with T-parity

Consider a non-linear sigma model with a global SU (5) symmetry of which the subgroup G1 ⊗ G2,
with each Gi ≡ SU (2)i ⊗ U (1)i, (i = 1, 2), is gauged. If Σ is a dimensionless scalar ﬁeld transforming
under the adjoint representation, its kinetic term could be parametrized as

thereby leading to 14 Goldstone bosons. The ﬁeld Σ can be expanded around the vev as

Σ(x) = e2iΠ/f Σ0 ,

where Π is the matrix containing the Goldstone degrees of freedom. The latter decompose under the

with Ω = diag(1, 1,−1, 1, 1). The transformation rules guarantee that the complex triplet ﬁeld is odd
under T parity, while the (usual) Higgs doublet is even. This has the consequence that the SM gauge

bosons do not mix with the T -odd heavy gauge bosons, thereby prohibiting any further corrections to

the low energy EW observables at tree level and thus relaxing the EW constraints on the model [20].

After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the masses of the T -odd partners of photon(Ah), Z
boson(Zh) and W boson(Wh) are given by,

with v (cid:39) 246 GeV being the electroweak breaking scale. The heavy photon Ah is the lightest T -odd
particle (LTP) and can serve as the DM candidate with the correct relic density [21–23].

Implementation of T -parity in the fermion sector requires a doubling of content and each fermion

doublet of the SM must be replaced by a pair of SU (2) doublets (Ψ1, Ψ2). Under T -parity, the doublets
exchange between themselves (Ψ1 ↔ Ψ2) and the T even combination remains almost massless and
is identiﬁed with the SM doublet. On the other hand, the T odd combination acquires a large mass,

courtesy a Yukawa coupling involving the large vev and an extra SU (2) singlet fermion (necessary,

anyway, for anomaly cancellation). For simplicity, we can assume an universal and ﬂavor diagonal

Yukawa coupling κ for both up and down type fermions. The mass terms will then, respectively, be

If f ∼ O(TeV), the masses for the exotic up and down type fermions become comparable. Since our
study concentrates on the ﬁrst two generations of T -odd heavy fermions, we desist from a discussion of

the top sector and point the reader to Refs. [18–20]. Thus, in a nutshell, the phenomenology relevant

to this paper is characterized by only two parameters, the scale f and the universal Yukawa coupling

κ.

3 Numerical Analysis

We now present a detailed discussion of our analysis, which pertains to the case of large κ, or, in other

words the situation where the T -odd fermions are signiﬁcantly heavier than the T -odd gauge bosons.

5

We limit ourselves to a study of the dominant processes, viz. the production of a pair of such fermions

(antifermions) on the one hand, and the associated production of a heavy gauge boson alongwith one

such fermion. In other words, the processes of interest are:

We focus mainly on the current and future runs of the LHC, keeping in mind the constraints on

the experiments to the two-dimensional parameter space (f ,κ), but also the bearing that the spectrum

has on the kinematics and, hence, the eﬃciencies. In Table 1, we list the values of the scale f and

the Yukawa coupling κ for the chosen benchmark points (BP), as also the relevant part of the T -odd

spectrum. The corresponding branching ratios of the up-type heavy quarks (uhi) and the heavy gauge
bosons are

where H is the light (standard model-like) Higgs. The branching ratios for the down-type heavy

quarks (dhi) are very similar to those for uhi. Furthermore, with the available phase space being quite
large in each case, the kinematic factors are negligible and there is relatively little diﬀerence between

the branching ratios for the two benchmark points.

where, (cid:96) = e, µ; b corresponds to a b-tagged jet and j denotes non b-tagged jets. The leading order

(LO) production cross-sections for each of the sub-processes listed in Eq. (11) are calculated using

MadGraph5 [31] and are listed in Table 2, wherein we have used the Cteq6L parton distributions.

Since the K-factors are larger than unity, the use of the LO cross sections for the signal events is

a conservative choice. The larger production cross-sections for BP1 (as compared to BP2) is but

a consequence of the lighter masses for the exotic particles. For our analysis, we use Madgraph5 to

generate the events at parton level at LO for both the signal as well as the SM background contributing

to the respective ﬁnal states under consideration. The model ﬁles for LHT, used in Madgraph5 are
generated using FeynRules [32]7. The unweighted parton level events are then passed for showering

through Pythia(v6.4) [33] to simulate showering and hadronisation eﬀects, including fragmentation.

For Detector simulation, we then pass these events through Delphes(v3) [34] where jets are constructed

using the anti-kT jet clustering algorithm with proper MLM matching scheme chosen for background
processes. Finally, we perform the cut analyses8 using MadAnalysis5 [35].

Several SM sub-processes constitute backgrounds to the aforementioned ﬁnal states. In particular,

one needs to consider:

• t¯t(+jets): Comprising the semi-inclusive cross-section for t¯t production with up to two additional
hard jets, this constitutes the dominant background for all the three ﬁnal states. For example,

the orders of magnitude larger cross section for top-production means that a disconcertingly

6Note that ﬁnal states with additional charged leptons are also possible, but the corresponding branching fractions

are smaller. Thus, the signal size is likely to prove a bottleneck in spite of a possibly better discriminatory power.

7We thank the authors of Ref. [24] for sharing the UFO model ﬁles.
8It is reassuring to note that even a parton model analysis reproduces much of the results at the 10% level, which,
in retrospect, is not surprising given the relatively clean nature of the signal and the presence of the lepton and missing
energy.

7

large number of such events would satisfy the requirement of a pair of b-jets reconstructing to

the SM Higgs peak.

• W ± + jets: With a signiﬁcantly hard ET/

distribution, this process serves as the dominant

background for the signal conﬁguration with a single charged lepton in the ﬁnal state (and no
b-jets). We consider here, the semi-inclusive cross section for W ± with up to three hard jets.

• Z + jets: While this could have been the major background for the signal conﬁguration with
two charged leptons in the ﬁnal state, a large ET/ requirement can eﬀectively suppress it. Akin
to the case for the W ± + jets background, this too includes the semi-inclusive cross section for
the production of Z with up to three hard jets.

• Diboson +jets: With large production cross-sections, W W (W Z, ZZ) with two hard jets pro-
duction in SM are signiﬁcant sources of background. For example, owing to mismeasurements,
a b¯b pair from a Z-decay could fake a Higgs. In addition, mistagging constitutes another source
for such backgrounds.

• Single top production: This will contribute mainly to ﬁnal state (i).

Since the ﬁnal states under discussion can also result from hard subprocesses accompanied by either

or both of initial and ﬁnal state radiation, or soft decays, we must impose some basic cuts before we

attempt to simulate the events. To this end, we demand that

∆R(cid:96)i > 0.2 ,

∆Rij > 0.7 ,

∆Rbi > 0.7 ,

p(cid:96)

We show, in Figs. 1,2 and 3, the histograms for the signal and background events after imposing only

the basic cuts of Eq. (14).

Figure 1: Normalized pT distributions for the leading (upper panels) and subleading (lower panels)
leptons. The left and right panels refer to BP1 and BP2 respectively.

To understand the transverse momentum distribution of the leading lepton (the upper panels of Fig. 1),
recall the decay chain for the signal processes. In all of the three processes, the heavy W ±
h is produced,
either directly or from the decay of heavy T -odd quarks. As already mentioned, for the parameter
space of interest, the W ±
h decay to W ± + Ah with almost 100% branching ratio and, hence, the
subsequent decay of the W ± generates leptons in the ﬁnal state. With the mass diﬀerence between
the W ±
h and SM W ± bosons being so large, the latter would, typically, have a large pT , even if the
former had a small pT . This translates to a large pT for the charged lepton emanating from the W ±
decay. Thus, for most events resulting from the process of (11b), the leading lepton tends to have a

large pT . For the other two production channels, at least a large fraction of the events would have
the Qh decaying into W ±
h , thereby bestowing the latter with a large pT to start with. It should be
realized though, that in each case, the possibility exists that, in a decay, the pT of a daughter, as
deﬁned in mother’s rest frame, is aligned against the mother’s pT . While this degradation of the pT is
not very important for the leading lepton, it certainly is so for the next-to-leading one, as is attested

to by the lower panels of Fig. 1. It is instructive to examine the corresponding distributions for the

background events. Since the W ’s (or Z’s) now have typically lower pT , the Jacobian peak at mW /2
(mZ/2) is quite visible, and particularly so for the next-to-leading lepton. For the leading one, the
peak, understandably, gets smeared on account of the inherent pT of the decaying boson. This eﬀect,

9

of course, is more pronounced for the signal events. The second, and more pronounced, peak in the

lower panels of Fig. 1 result from non-resonant processes and/or conﬁgurations wherein the lepton

travels against the direction of its parent. This motivates our cuts on the lepton pT s.

Figure 2: Normalized pT distributions for the three leading (top to bottom) non b-tagged jets for BP1
(left sets) and BP2 (right sets).

In an analogous fashion, the decay of the heavy T -odd quark (almost) always yields a high-pT jet owing
to the large diﬀerence between its mass and those for T -odd bosons. Consequently, a requirement of
pT (j1) (cid:38) 250 GeV would eliminate only a very small fraction of the signal events (for each of the three
channels, while, potentially, removing a signiﬁcant fraction of the background events (see upper panels

of Fig. 2). For process (11a), the decay of the second Qh would lead to a jet almost as hard. On the
other hand, for channels (11b & 11c), the second jet results only from the decays of the W ± or the H.
Intrinsically much softer, these still gain from the pT of the mother. Consequently, the second leading
jet, very often, may have a pT larger than 200 GeV (see the middle panels of Fig. 2). For the processes
under discussion, a third jet can only result from the (cascade) decay of a SM boson, and, hence, is

10

typically softer (the lower panels of Fig. 2) and hence, for three-jet ﬁnal states, the requirement on

the third jet pT should not be much stricter than about 45 GeV.

Figure 3: Normalized distributions for the missing transverse energy (top panels), the eﬀective mass
(second row), the b¯b invariant mass (third row) and ∆Rbb (bottom panels). In each case, the left and
right panels correspond to BP1 and BP2 respectively.

Next, we turn to some derived kinematic variables. The ﬁrst quantity of interest is the missing
transverse energy (ET/ ). For the background events, this arises from the neutrinos (courtesy W ± or
Z decays) or mismeasurement of the jet and lepton momenta. For the signal events, this receives

11

an additional contribution from the heavy photon Ah, which is stable because of T -parity. Not only
does the Ah have a large mass, but also a large pT owing to the large diﬀerence in the masses of the
mother and the daughters (on each occasion wherein it is produced). Consequently, the ET/ spectrum
is much harder for the signal (the upper panels of Fig. 3) and a requirement of ET/ > 250 GeV would
signiﬁcantly improve the signal to background ratio.

Another variable of interest is the eﬀective mass variable deﬁned as

4(cid:88)

Meﬀ =

|pT (j)|n + ET/

(16)

n=1

where the sum goes over up to four jets. Similar to the case for the ET/ distribution, the high masses
of the exotic T -odd particles leads to a large Meﬀ for the signal events as one can see from the second
panel of Fig. 3. Hence, a signiﬁcant (Meﬀ ) cut also helps in reducing the background events.

Finally, for events with two tagged b-jets, we may consider the invariant mass of the pair (the third

row of Fig. 3). In the signal events, the Zh decays to a Higgs boson and Ah, with the former decaying
predominantly into a b¯b pair. Due to the large mass diﬀerence between Zh and Ah, the Higgs boson
will be produced with a high pT which will be imparted to its decay products. As a result, the b¯b
pair will be produced with a relatively small opening angle. On the other hand, the b’s in the SM

background arise, primarily, from three classes of processes: (a) the decay of diﬀerent top-quarks where

the separation between them show a much broader structure; (b) the decay of a Z boson, wherein the

invariant mass would peak at mZ, and owing to the relatively low momentum of the Z, the b’s be
well-separated (in fact, close to being back-to-back); and (c) from non-resonant processes where the

b’s would be softer and, again, ∆Rb¯b would have a wider distribution. These features are well reﬂected
by the third and fourth rows of Fig. 3. It is, thus, expected that a judicious upper cut on ∆Rb¯b would
deﬁnitely improve the signal signiﬁcance. Similarly, a good energy-momentum resolution for the b-jets

would serve to remove much of the Z-background.

3.1 Cut Analysis:

All the processes in Eq. (11) may contribute to a given ﬁnal state—of Eq. (13)—and, henceforth, we

include all under ‘Signal’, while ‘Background’ receives contributions from all SM processes leading to

the particular ﬁnal state.

In addition to the basic cuts of Eq. (14), further selection cuts may be imposed in order to improve

the signal to background ratio. Understandably, these selections cuts would depend on the ﬁnal

state under consideration, both in respect of the diﬀerences in event topology for the signal and the

12

background, as well as on the actual size of the signal. In particular, we are guided by the requirement

that not too large an integrated luminosity is required to reach a 5σ signiﬁcance (S = 5), with S being

S =

√

NS

NS + NB

,

(17)

where NS and NB represent number of signal and background events respectively. We now take up
each ﬁnal state given in Eq. (13) and describe the kinematic cut ﬂow followed in selecting events for

the signal while suppressing the background.

3.1.1

1(cid:96)± + nj + ET/ ; n ≥ 3

This ﬁnal state for the signal receives contribution from both the strongly produced T -odd quark pair

as well as the associated production modes, thus giving us the maximum signal event rate amongst the

ﬁnal states under consideration. Here the single charged lepton almost always comes from the decay

of a W boson resulting from the cascades. The selection cuts, in the order that they are imposed, are:

1. pT (j3) > 45 GeV and |η(j)| < 2.5 (C1–1): In other words, we demand that our ﬁnal state has
at least three jets within the given pseudo-rapidity range, each with a minimum pT of 45 GeV.
This choice is motivated by the lowest panels of Fig. 2.

2. pT (j1) > 250 GeV (C1–2): Given that the hardest jet is, typically, much harder for the signal
events than it is for the background (see top panels of Fig. 2), we ask that pT (j1) > 250 GeV.
This, understandably, helps increase the signal to noise ratio to a remarkable extent.

3. pT (j2) > 200 GeV (C1–3): Similarly, we demand that the pT of the second hardest jet be more
than 200 GeV. In particular, this reduces (moderately) the t¯t and W + n-jets background (with

only a smaller eﬀect on the Z background) while having only a marginal eﬀect on the signal

strength.

4. Meﬀ > 1.2 TeV (C1–4): Motivated by the second row of Fig. 3, we demand that Meﬀ > 1.2 TeV.

Such a high value eﬀectively suppresses the background without reducing much of the signal.

5. ET/ > 250 GeV (C1–5): The top row of Fig. 3 bears our (previously stated) expectations that
the extent of transverse momentum imbalance (ET/ ) would be far larger for the signal events
than that for the background. Consequently, this requirement improves considerably the signal

to background ratio.

6. pT ((cid:96)1) > 20 GeV (C1–6): Finally, to distinguish this ﬁnal state from that considered in Sec. 3.1.3,

we require that there be only one isolated charged lepton e, µ with a pT more than 20 GeV.

Table 4: Cut-ﬂow for ﬁnal state (i) at

s = 14 TeV.

In Tables 3(4), we display the eﬀect, for

√

s = 13(14) TeV, that these cuts have on the signal and

background events, when applied successively in the order described above. It is noteworthy that a

discovery in this ﬁnal state is possible at the current LHC Run with an integrated luminosity as little
as ∼ 8 fb−1 and ∼ 20 fb−1 for BP1 and BP2 respectively. The corresponding numbers for LHC Run
II are ∼ 5 fb−1 and ∼ 12 fb−1 respectively.

3.1.2

1(cid:96)± + 2b + j + ET/

Since the interest in this channel owes to the possibility of reconstructing the Higgs (and possibly

develop an experimental handle on the very structure of the theory), the cuts now have to be reor-

ganized keeping in mind both the origin (and, hence, the distributions) of the b-jets, as well as the

signal strength.

14

1. pT ((cid:96)1) > 20 GeV (C2–1): A single isolated lepton is required with a pT more than 20 GeV.
2. |η(j1)| < 2.5 & pT (j1) > 250 GeV (C2–2): This is exactly akin to cut C1–2 of Sec. 3.1.1 and

owes to the fact that the origin of the hardest jet is the same for the two conﬁgurations.

3. ET/ > 250 GeV (C2–3): This, again, is similar to cut C1–5 of Sec. 3.1.1, and particularly helps

eliminate much of the dominant t¯t background.

4. pT (b2) > 40 GeV (C2–4): As far as the signal events are concerned, the b-jets arise from the
decay chain Zh → Ah + H → Ah + b¯b. The large mass diﬀerence between the Zh and Ah would
be manifested in a large boost for the H which, very often, would be translated to a large pT
for the b-jets. On the other hand, the SM background is dominated by the t¯t contribution, with

typically, has a smaller pT for the b-jets. Thus, requiring that at least two b-jets have substantial
pT would discriminate against the background. It might seem that imposing a harder cut on
pT (b1) would be beneﬁcial. While this, per se, is indeed true, such a gain is subsumed (and, in
fact, bettered) by the next two cuts. Hence, we desist from imposing one such.

5. ∆Rb¯b < 1.5 (C2–5): The aforementioned large boost for the H in the signal events would,
typically, result in the two b-jets being relatively close to each other. On the other hand, the
background events from t¯t would have a much wider distribution, whereas b’s emanating from

associated H-production (which, in the SM, is dominated by low-pT Higgs) would, preferentially,
be back to back (see third row of Fig. 3). Thus, an upper limit on the angular separation between

the two tagged b-jets considerably improves the signal-to background ratio.

6. Additional cut 110 < Mb¯b < 160 GeV (C2–6): This, obviously, serves to accentuate the contri-

bution from an on-shell Higgs.

The eﬀects of the aforementioned cuts are summarised in Tables 5(6). As expected, the signal strength

is much weaker when compared to that discussed in Sec. 3.1.1. While the background rate suﬀers a

suppression too, it is not enough and the required integrated luminosity is much larger in the present

case. However, the combination of cuts on ∆Rb¯b and Mb¯b brings discovery into the realm of possibility
even for the present run of the LHC and certainly so for that at

s = 14 TeV.

√

3.1.3

2(cid:96)± + nj + ET/ ; n ≥ 2

This ﬁnal state receives contributions only from the primary production channels of Eq. (11a &

11b), and not from that of Eq. (11c). Consequently, the signal size is smaller. However, the higher

multiplicity of the charged lepton in the ﬁnal state proves helpful in suppressing the background,

provided we re-tune the kinematic selections as follows:

1. |ηj| < 2.5 (C3–1): The requirement of jet “centrality” remains the same.

16

2. pT (j1) > 300 GeV (C3–2): The requirement on the hardest jet is now strengthened. This reduces
the cross-sections for most of the background subprocesses by 2-3 order of magnitude whereas

the signal cross-section is reduced only by a few percent.

3. pT (j2) > 200 GeV (C3–3): The preceding cut (C3–2) also serves to harden the spectrum of the
next sub-leading jet. Although this happens for both signal and background, the eﬀect is larger

for the former. This allows us to demand that the next to leading jet should have a minimum

pT of 200 GeV. While the improvement is not as dramatic as in the case of C3–2, the signal to
noise ratio does improve fairly (see Table. 7(8)).

4. pT ((cid:96)1) > 20 GeV (C3–4): As in the previous cases, this requirement on the hardest isolated
lepton is a very good discriminant. Most of the major background sources are suppressed by

at least an order of magnitude (see Table. 7(8)), with the suppressions for the single-top and

Z + n-jets production being even more pronounced.

5. pT ((cid:96)2) > 20 GeV (C3–5): The success of C3–4 prompts us to require that even the next hardest
isolated lepton should have pT > 20 GeV. As Table. 7(8) testiﬁes, the major backgrounds (after
the imposition of C3–4), namely t¯t– and W + n-jets production suﬀer severe suppression.

6. Meﬀ > 1.2 TeV (C3–6): Analogous to (C1–4), we impose a high value of Meﬀ to further suppress

the background cross section.

7. ET/ > 250 GeV (C3–7): Additionally, we demand a large ET/ to enhance the signal signiﬁcance.

Note that although the dilepton ﬁnal state has a reduced signal cross-section as compared to that with

a single lepton, the requirement of a second isolated lepton also signiﬁcantly reduces the background.

Therefore, this ﬁnal state requires moderate values for integrated luminosity at 13(14) TeV LHC,

4 Summary and conclusions

The very lightness of the Higgs boson that was discovered at the LHC has been a cause for concern,

especially in the absence of any indication for physics beyond the SM that could be responsible for

keeping it light. Amongst others, Little Higgs scenarios provide an intriguing explanation for the same.

While several variants have been considered in the literature, in this paper, we examine a particularly

elegant version, namely the Littlest Higgs model with a Z2 symmetry (T -parity). The latter not only
alleviates the severe constraints (on such models) from the electroweak precision measurements but

also provides for a viable Dark Matter candidate in the shape of Ah, the exotic gauge partner of the
photon.

At the LHC, the exotic particles can only be pair-produced on account of the aforementioned T -parity.

Understandably, the production cross sections are, typically, the largest for the strongly-interacting

particles. For example, if the exotic quarks Qih are light enough to have a large branching fraction into
their SM counterparts and the Ah, we would have a very pronounced excess in a ﬁnal state comprising
a dijet along with large missing-pT [30]. On the other hand, if the Qih are heavier than Wh and Zh (as
can happen for a wide expanse of the parameter space) then they decay into the latter instead, with

these, in turn decaying into their SM counterparts (or the Higgs), resulting in a ﬁnal state comprising

multiple jets, possibly leptons and missing-pT [37,38], and it is this possibility that we concentrate on.
The parameter space of interest is the two-dimensional one, spanned by f , the scale of breaking of the

larger symmetry and κ, the universal Yukawa coupling. Although a part of it is already ruled out by

18

the negative results from the 8 TeV run, a very large expanse is still unconstrained by these analyses.

We illustrate our search strategies choosing representative benchmark points from within the latter

set. We consider not only the production of a pair of exotic quarks, but also the associated production

of Wh/Zh with such a quark. Concentrating on the ﬁnal state comprising leptons plus jets plus missing
transverse energy, we consider all the SM processes that could conspire to contribute as background to

our LHT signal, and perform a full detector level simulation of the signal and background to estimate

the discovery potential at the current run and subsequent upgrade of the LHC.

The large mass diﬀerence between the Qih and Wh/Zh results in large momenta for at least a few of
the jets. Similarly, the even larger mass diﬀerence between the Wh/Zh and the Ah results, typically,
in large missing-momentum. This encourages us to consider ﬁnal states consisting of hard jets and

leptons and large missing transverse momentum. We observe that ﬁnal states with only one isolated
charged lepton (e±, µ±) and with at least three jets and substantial missing transverse energy are
the ones most amenable to discovery. For example, at the 13(14) TeV LHC with only 8(5) fb−1 and
20(12) fb−1 integrated luminosity for our BP1 and BP2 respectively. A conﬁrmatory test is aﬀorded
by a ﬁnal state requiring one extra isolated lepton. Though this decreases the signal cross-section
signiﬁcantly, LHC Run II can still reach the discovery level, but now only with 40(26) fb−1 and
203(116) fb−1 integrated luminosity at 13(14) TeV.

We however wish to highlight, through this work, a more interesting signal, one with 2 tagged b-jets

in the ﬁnal state. As discussed earlier (Eq. (12c)), the heavy Zh boson decays to a Higgs boson and
the Ah with almost 100% branching ratio. This presents us with an unique opportunity to reconstruct
the Higgs mass from the tagged b-jets, thus providing us with an important insight into the LHT

parameter space. As we have found out, the reconstruction of Higgs mass requires higher integrated
luminosity (few hundred fb−1)) but it is still within the reach of the LHC run II. We, thus, hope that
our analysis demonstrates the viability of testing the LHT model in the current run of the LHC.
