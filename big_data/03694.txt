Abstract

We combine traction force data with Bayesian inversion to obtain an absolute estimate
of the internal stress ﬁeld of a cell monolayer. The method, Bayesian inversion stress
microscopy (BISM), is validated using numerical simulations performed in a wide range of
conditions. It is robust to changes in each ingredient of the underlying statistical model.
Importantly, its accuracy does not depend on the rheology of the tissue. We apply BISM
to experimental traction force data measured in a narrow ring of cohesive epithelial cells,
and check that the inferred stress ﬁeld coincides with that obtained by direct spatial
integration of the traction force data in this quasi-one-dimensional geometry.

1 Introduction

Dynamical behaviors of multicellular assemblies play a crucial role during tissue develop-
ment [1] and in the maintenance of adult tissues [2]. In addition, disregulation of multicel-
lular structures may lead to pathological situations such as tumor formation and tumor
progression [3]. In this context, cell monolayers have been extensively studied to model
in vivo tissue functions. Such approaches allow for well-controlled experiments, which
have been performed in a variety of settings, such as monolayer spreading [4, 5], wound
healing [6, 7], channel ﬂow [8, 9], conﬁned ﬂow [10, 11], collective migration [12, 13].
The dynamics of multicellular assemblies is regulated through mechanical forces that act
upon cell adhesive structures. These forces are exerted at the cell-substrate interface [14],
but also through cell-cell junctions [15]. The transmission of stresses within multicellular
assemblies is thus important to understand collective movements, cell rearrangements
and tissue homeostasis. Even though kinematic information is readily available, mechan-
ical properties that rely on internal stress are less well understood. Indeed a number of
important biological questions, such as the determination of the molecular mechanisms
that underlie the transmission of force within a tissue [16], necessitate a measurement of
internal stresses.

Several internal force measurement methods have been proposed and implemented (see
[17] for a recent review): at the molecular scale, Förster resonance energy transfer [18, 19];
at the cell scale, microrheology [20, 21]; at the tissue scale, liquid drops [22], birefringence
[23], or laser ablation [24, 25]. Although one would ideally like to read out from data
the spatio-temporal dependence of the full stress ﬁeld, the above methods yield either a
local, sub-tissue scale measurement [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]; or a subset of the components of
the stress tensor [23], or a relative measurement, up to an undetermined multiplicative
constant [24, 25]. Monolayer stress microscopy (MSM), ﬁrst introduced in [26], does not
suﬀer from these drawbacks: it builds upon the measurement of traction force data to
estimate the stress ﬁeld of monolayers of cohesive cells.
Indeed, the force exerted by
cells on a planar deformable substrate can be computed from the displacement ﬁeld of
the underlying layer [27, 28], using either: (i) traction force microscopy [29, 30, 5] where
small beads are inserted within the (elastic) substrate, their displacements are measured,
and the traction forces are obtained by solving an inverse elastic problem; or (ii) arrays of
micropillars [31, 32, 33], where the traction forces are simply proportional to the in-plane
displacements of the pillars. However, once the traction forces are known, obtaining the
internal stress from the force balance equations is an underdetermined problem since, in
the two dimensional case, three components of the symmetrical stress tensor must be
obtained from two traction force components. In MSM [26, 34], these equations become
well-posed thanks to an additional hypothesis on tissue rheology: the cell monolayer is
assumed to be a linear, isotropic elastic body. MSM has been validated independently
on numerical data using particle dynamics simulations: in [35], the reasonable accuracy
of stress reconstruction from data that does not correspond to an elastic rheology has
been attributed to the weakness of shear stresses in both simulated and living tissues.
Assuming again that the tissue is an elastic body, and in addition that the displacement
ﬁeld is continuous at the cell-substrate interface, internal stresses may also be computed
directly from substrate displacement data, circumventing the need to compute traction
forces [36].

In the presence of cell divisions and extrusions that constantly rearrange a tissue
[37], it is not clear that its rheology is that of a solid body. To our knowledge, the
elastic rheology hypothesis has not been directly validated, while alternative rheologies
have been proposed in the literature [38, 39, 40, 7] and shown to model successfully
speciﬁc aspects of the mechanical behaviour of cell monolayers. Further, the rheology
of multicellular assemblies may depend on the timescale [37], as well as on the type of
cell considered [41]. These caveats call for a method to accurately estimate the internal
stress ﬁeld of a cell monolayer irrespective of the underlying rheology.

A classical way to solve underdetermined inversion problems involves Bayesian infer-
ence [42], a technique originating in statistics [43], and now widely used in physics [44]
and biophysics [45]. Of note, Bayesian inversion has also been used to solve the inverse
elastic problem of traction force microscopy [46, 47]. Recently, some among us proposed
a Bayesian force inference method based on cell geometry, and applied it to segmented
images of the Drosophila pupal wing and notum [48, 49, 50]. The tissue-scale stress arises
from coarse-graining of cell-cell interactions. For tight epithelia where adherens junctions
are a key player of force transmission between neighboring cells, it is reasonable to as-

2

sume that the cell-scale contribution to stress is mostly related to local contact within
the apical side of the epithelium, whereas basal contributions from, e.g. lamellipodia, are
negligible. Accordingly, the dominant contributors to tissue-scale stress were identiﬁed as
cell pressures and cell-cell junction tensions, and force balance equations were written at
each cell vertex, resulting in an underdetermined system. This system was solved using
Bayesian inversion [42], where the inferred tensions and pressures were the most likely
values (the modes) of a posterior distribution function. In the case of the fruitﬂy pupal
wing, it turned out that tissue stress, obtained by coarse-graining, is oriented by external
forces, and that its anisotropy promotes hexagonal cell packing [49]. Similar systems of
equations may become well-posed thanks to additional hypotheses (equal cell pressures
[50, 51]), or when cell pressures are not required [52]. However the stress is measured up
to an arbitrary additive constant: its absolute value is out of reach since the input data
are cell vertex positions and cell junction angles.

Below, we formulate Bayesian inversion stress microscopy (BISM), a method to esti-
mate the internal stress ﬁeld of a cell monolayer from traction force microscopy measure-
ments. Importantly, BISM yields an absolute measure of the stress and dispenses with
hypotheses on monolayer rheology. We deﬁne BISM and introduce statistical measures of
its accuracy. The method is ﬁrst validated using numerical simulations that provide trac-
tion force data. The inferred stress ﬁeld, once computed, is compared to the simulated
stress data used as a reference. Robustness is checked by implementing changes in the
statistical model, as well as in the mechanical ingredients of the numerical simulations.
BISM is further validated using experimental data in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry
that allows for a direct calculation of the stress ﬁeld by spatial integration of the traction
force ﬁeld. Finally, our results are compared with existing methods.

2 Methods

2.1 Mechanics
Within a continuum description, a ﬂat, thin cell monolayer is characterized at position
(cid:126)r and time t by a ﬁeld of two-dimensional internal stresses σ((cid:126)r, t) and by a ﬁeld of
external surfacic forces (cid:126)t((cid:126)r, t) that the monolayer exerts on the substrate. Since inertia
is negligible, the balance of linear momentum reads in vector form

div σ = (cid:126)t,

to angular momentum conservation [53]). With a conﬁned monolayer in mind [10, 11],
the boundary condition reads

σij nj = 0

(4)

where (cid:126)n denotes the vector normal to the edge, and summation over repeated indices
is implied.
In the plane, the units of stresses and (surfacic) forces are Pa.m and Pa
respectively. Assuming that the monolayer height is uniform and constant h((cid:126)r, t) = h0,
the 3D stress reads σ3D = σ/h0. When spatial or temporal variations of the height cannot
be neglected [4, 5], BISM can be implemented by replacing (cid:126)t((cid:126)r, t) by (cid:126)t((cid:126)r, t)/h((cid:126)r, t) and
by inferring the 3D stress from div σ3D = (cid:126)t/h, provided that the height remains small
compared to the system size, as is generally the case for in vitro cell monolayers [26, 54].
A treatment of the full 3D case where the height is comparable or larger than the system
size is beyond the scope of this work.

Since experimental traction forces are measured with a ﬁnite spatial resolution l, as-
sumed to be isotropic for simplicity, we write a force balance equation in each of a large
number of square surface elements of area l2 (see Fig. 1a). We aim at inferring the stress

(cid:1) in each element. The traction force exerted by the tissue

tensor σ(i, j) =(cid:0) σxx(i,j) σyx(i,j)

σxy(i,j) σyy(i,j)

in element (i, j) on the substrate is (cid:126)t(i, j), with components tx(i, j), ty(i, j). In the case
of a rectangular grid with C columns and R rows, the discretized force balance equation
for element (i, j) reads

l [σxx(i + 1, j) − σxx(i, j) + σxy(i, j + 1) − σxy(i, j)] = l2 tx(i, j)
l [σyx(i + 1, j) − σyx(i, j) + σyy(i, j + 1) − σyy(i, j)] = l2 ty(i, j)

to lowest order in l (see Fig. 1b). We thus have N = C × R variables for tx and ty,
(C + 1)× R variables for σxx and σyx and C × (R + 1) variables for σyy and σxy. Deﬁning
traction force and stress vectors as

(cid:126)T = [tx(1, 1)··· tx(R, C) ty(1, 1)··· ty(R, C)]t
(cid:126)σ = [σxx(1, 1)··· σxx(C + 1, R) σyy(1, 1)··· σyy(C, R + 1)
σxy(1, 1)··· σxy(C, R + 1) σyx(1, 1)··· σyx(C + 1, R)]t

where the superscript t denotes the transpose, we rewrite Eqs. (5-6) in matrix form

A (cid:126)σ = (cid:126)T .

The matrix A, of size 2N × (4N + 2(C + R)), may be decomposed as

A =(cid:0) Ax 0 Ay 0

0 Ay 0 Ax

(cid:1)

(7)

(8)

where Ax and Ay correspond to the discretized matrix forms, at second order in l, of the
partial derivatives with respect to x and y.

2.2 Statistics
To solve the underdetermined linear system (7), we implement Bayesian inversion [42]:
all variables and parameters of the problem are probabilized. For simplicity, we use
wherever possible Gaussian probability distribution functions, denoted N ( (cid:126)X | (cid:126)m, S) for
a multivariate (vector) Gaussian random variable (cid:126)X with mean (cid:126)m and covariance matrix
S.

Likelihood The ﬁrst ingredient of the statistical model is the likelihood function L( (cid:126)T |
(cid:126)σ), which contains information provided by experimental measurements. For experi-
mental data, the force balance equations (7) are veriﬁed up to an additive noise due to
measurement errors. Assuming this noise to be Gaussian with zero mean and uniform
covariance matrix S = s2 I, where the parameter s2 denotes the noise variance and I is
the identity matrix, the likelihood is expressed as L( (cid:126)T | (cid:126)σ) = N ( (cid:126)T | A(cid:126)σ, s2 I) or

Prior Second, the prior probability distribution function π((cid:126)σ) embeds additional infor-
mation concerning the stress ﬁeld:

(i) we assume that the stress obeys a Gaussian distribution function with zero mean

(cid:126)σ0 = (cid:126)0 and covariance matrix s2

0 I;

5

(ii) we enforce the equality of the two oﬀ-diagonal components of the stress tensor: in
compact vector form (cid:126)σxy = (cid:126)σyx, i.e. σxy(i, j) + σxy(i, j + 1) = σyx(i, j) + σyx(i +
1, j) ∀(i, j) (see Fig. 1b and ST 1.3 );

(iii) we enforce the boundary conditions (4), namely two conditions at each boundary

element (i, j), written in compact vector form (cid:126)σBC = (cid:126)0).

(cid:34)
Up to a normalizing factor, the prior reads

The second ingredient of the statistical model is a Gaussian prior π((cid:126)σ) = N ((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)0, S0 =
0 B) where B is a reduced covariance matrix of determinant |B|. Note that a Gaussian
s2
prior suppresses stress values larger than a few times s0 (see [55] for a similar approach
in the context of traction force microscopy). In practice, we set the hyperparameters αxy
and αBC to the values αxy = αBC = 103, large enough for conditions (ii) and (iii) to be
enforced (see ST 3.2 for a discussion of these values). If required by a given experimental
set-up, the boundary conditions should be modiﬁed appropriately in the deﬁnition of the
prior.

Resolution According to Bayes’ theorem, the posterior (conditional) probability distri-
bution function Π((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)T ) of the stress given the traction force data is proportional to the
product of the likelihood by the prior

(12)
Since both are Gaussian, the posterior is also Gaussian Π((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)T ) = N ((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)σΠ, SΠ), with
a covariance matrix SΠ and a mean (cid:126)σΠ given by [42]

Π((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)T ) ∝ L( (cid:126)T | (cid:126)σ) × π((cid:126)σ)

0 + At S−1 A(cid:1)−1

(cid:126)σΠ = SΠ At S−1 (cid:126)T

(13)
(14)

We use maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation [42] and deﬁne the inferred stress (cid:126)ˆσ as
the mode (maximal value) of the posterior (cid:126)ˆσ = (cid:126)σΠ. Qualitatively, the underdeterminacy
has been lifted: 4N + 2(R + C) unknown stress values are determined from 2N traction
force values, 4N +2(R+C) conditions from the Gaussian distribution of the stress tensor,
N equalities of the two shear components and 4(R + C) boundary conditions.

In this Gaussian model, MAP estimation is identical to minimization of a Tikhonov

potential [42]. The dimensionless regularization parameter

2.3 Measures of accuracy
The numerical resolution of a set of hydrodynamical equations yields a numerical data
set {tnum} of traction forces, from which we compute a set {σinf} of inferred stresses.
Since the numerical data set {σnum} of stresses is also available, measures of accuracy
involving numerical simulations typically compare {σinf} with {σnum}.

A classical “goodness-of-ﬁt” measure is the coeﬃcient of determination, deﬁned for the

σxx component of the stress as

where the sums and the averages (cid:104). . .(cid:105) are performed over space. Similar deﬁnitions apply
to other components, and allow to deﬁne an aggregate coeﬃcient of determination R2
σ
averaged over all stress components. Accurate estimates correspond to numerical values
of R2
σ close to 1. The discretized force balance equations (5-6), used as a deﬁnition of
inferred traction forces, yield a set {tinf} of inferred traction forces computed from the
set of inferred stresses {σinf}. Comparing {tnum} with {tinf} allows to deﬁne similarly a
T diagnostic for numerical data.
R2
When analyzing an experimental data set {texp} of traction forces, R2
σ cannot be
computed in the absence of a reference set of stresses. As above, comparing {texp} with

{tinf} allows to deﬁne a measure of accuracy for experimental data, the coeﬃcient of
determination R2
T diagnostic,
deﬁned as the average value of the square of reduced residuals

T . An alternative measure of predictive accuracy is the χ2

(cid:88) (texp − tinf )2

δ ˆT 2

χ2

T =

2N

(22)

where the sum is performed over space and over traction force components. This mea-
sure of accuracy is, up to a normalizing factor, similar to the “omnibus goodness-of-ﬁt”
measure advocated in [56, 57]. The estimated standard deviation δ ˆT may be replaced in
Eq. (22) by the measurement error δt. Numerical values of χ2
T close to 0 are indicators
of high accuracy.

A last test of accuracy is provided by the calculation of average experimental stress
values from traction force data [53], which may be compared with the average inferred
stresses for each component (see Sec. 3.4 and ST 1.4 ).

2.4 Experimental methods
We used MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells as an epithelial cell model.

Cell Culture MDCK wild-type cells were cultured in media containing DMEM (Life
Technologies), 10 % FBS (Life Technologies) and 1 % antibiotics (penicillin and strepto-
mycin).

Micro-contact printing and substrate preparation for Traction Force Microscopy We
measured the traction forces exerted by cells on their substrate by using soft silicone gel
as previously described [58]. Fluorescent beads were deposited onto the gel to measure
the displacement ﬁeld. Brieﬂy, a thin layer of the gel was spread on a glass bottom
dish and then cured at 80oC for 2 hours. Cured gel was silanized using 5% solution
of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma) in pure ethanol. This gel was later
incubated for 5 minutes with 100 nm carboxylated ﬂuorescent beads (Invitrogen) sus-
pended in deionized (DI) water. Subsequently, the substrate was dried and micro-contact
printed with ﬁbronectin [13, 59] using a thin water soluble Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) mem-
brane which allows the transfer of ﬁbronectin on soft gel. The PVA membrane was later
dissolved and the non-contact printed areas were blocked using 0.2 % pluronics (Sigma)
solution. The substrate was then washed and was seeded with cells. Cells were allowed
to grow until the micro-contact printed area was fully covered.

The images were acquired using phase contrast and ﬂuorescent channels to record cell

positions and bead displacements, respectively.

For analysis, the imaging drifts were corrected in ImageJ (NIH) using the Image Sta-
bilizer plugin [60]. To analyze the displacement ﬁeld of beads, we used an open source
iterative PIV (particle image velocimetry) plugin in ImageJ [61]. To reconstruct the
traction force ﬁeld from the obtained displacement ﬁeld, an open source Fourier trans-
form traction cytometry (FTTC) plugin was used in ImageJ [61]. The resulting traction
force values were taken for the validation of the BISM inferred stress ﬁelds. To estimate

9

the experimental error δtexp made on traction force measurements, we calculated the
mean value of traction forces measured on square regions of the substrate devoid of cells
(surface area 50 × 50 µm2).

Monolayer height measurement The conﬂuent cell monolayer was ﬁxed for immunoﬂu-
orescence microscopy. Actin present inside the cells was ﬂuorescently labeled using Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS. To measure tis-
sue height, overall cell shape was then visualized with the help of cortical actin. Imaging
was done using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with a step size of 0.4 µm to capture
the entire height of the tissue. In the conﬁned ring shape geometry, height was measured
at diﬀerent locations to obtain the mean value and standard deviation of the monolayer
height h = 5.3 ± 1.2 µm.

3 Results

3.1 Validation: numerical data

A ﬁrst example of the application of BISM to a numerical data set is given by using
the traction force ﬁeld of a compressible viscous ﬂuid driven by active force dipoles,
interacting with its substrate through an eﬀective ﬂuid friction force, and conﬁned in a
square, with the boundary conditions (4). We solve this problem on a 100 × 100 µm2
square over a regular cartesian grid with C = R = 50, N = C × R = 2500 and l = 2 µm
(see ST 1.1 ). We use material parameter values typical of cell monolayers:
friction
coeﬃcient ξv = 100 kPa µm−1s [7], shear viscosity η = 103 kPa µm s [62], and compression
viscosity η(cid:48) = η. To account for the measurement error, we add to the traction force ﬁeld

All qualitative and quantitative indicators show that the stress ﬁeld has been inferred

accurately.

3.2 Robustness to variations of the statistical model

We test the robustness of BISM by varying one by one each feature of the statistical
model, ﬁrst focusing on alternative deﬁnitions of the prior, arguably our most prominent
assumption, second modifying the likelihood, the hyperprior and the resolution method.
For conciseness, precise deﬁnitions and implementations are given in ST 2.1-2.3. Table S1
in the Supporting Material lists the values of R2
σ thus obtained, given the same numerical
data sets as for BISM.

Setting αxy to 0 in the deﬁnition of the prior has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the accuracy
σ = 0.75): the symmetry of the stress tensor needs to be enforced in
xx =
yx = 0.61). In a similar way, knowledge

of inference (R2
the prior for accurate estimation. Unsurprisingly, this impacts less the diagonal (R2
R2

yy = 0.81) than the shear components (R2

xy = R2

of the correct boundary conditions should be included in the prior whenever possible:
σ = 0.53). We shall further comment
setting αBC to 0 has a large negative impact (R2
below on the inﬂuence of boundary conditions.

Importantly, the accuracy of inference remains excellent when the prior, the likelihood,
or the hyperprior distributions are not Gaussian. This shows that the accuracy of BISM
does not depend sensitively on a Gaussian assumption. Of note, we do not assume that
traction force data obeys a Gaussian distribution. The data set ({tnum} or {texp}) is used
as is – indeed experimental traction force distributions are known to exhibit exponential
tails [5, 63]. In all cases, the regularization parameter is small Λ(∞) (cid:28) 1 (see Table S3 in
the Supporting Material): the distribution of inferred stresses {σinf} depends mostly on
the empirical distribution of traction force data. Thus, even if the multivariate posterior
distribution is Gaussian, the univariate, empirical distribution of the inferred stress (the
mode (cid:126)σΠ (∞)) is not necessarily Gaussian (see Fig. S7 in the Supporting Material for
numerical data). Similarly, even if the stress prior distribution function has a zero mean,
the mean inferred stress is not necessarily equal to zero (see Fig. 5i for an example).
The small values of Λ(∞) are consistent with robustness with respect to variations of the
prior.

We conclude that BISM is robust to variations of the statistical model.

3.3 Robustness to variations of the numerical simulation
We next apply BISM to a broad spectrum of numerical data, and vary successively the
values of material parameters, the rheology, the boundary conditions, the system shape,
the spatial resolution, the nature and the amplitude of the measurement noise (see ST
2.2 ).

Given the values of R2

σ compiled in Table S2 in the Supporting Material, we verify that
BISM remains accurate with a diﬀerent (elastic) rheology (also set Elastic 1 in Table 1),

12

or in a diﬀerent (circular) geometry. In the viscous case, we observe that the accuracy
decreases as a function of the bulk viscosity η(cid:48). For larger η(cid:48), we observe larger values
of stress components, leading to asymmetrical distributions: this is at variance with our
assumption of an even prior distribution, and may explain the lower value of R2
σ obtained
when η(cid:48) = 101 η.

Accuracy decreases when the prior does not include our knowledge of the bound-
ary conditions. However the inﬂuence of erroneous values of the stress at the system’s
boundaries rapidly decreases far from the edge. When the coeﬃcient αBC is set to 0,
removing the outtermost rows and columns increases R2
σ from 0.53 to 0.60. We estimate
the corresponding “penetration length” of boundary values to about 10% of the system
size, consistent with [34]. We conclude that, whenever available, the correct boundary
conditions should be taken into account in the prior.

Importantly (see Fig. 4), accuracy remains acceptable (R2

σ > 0.8) for a spatial resolu-
tion larger than a few data points per cell, as well as for measurement noise levels up to
20 % of the traction force amplitude, consistent with measurement errors typical of force
traction microscopy [31].

These results highlight that BISM is robust to variations of the numerical simulations

that yield the traction force data.

3.4 Validation: experimental data
While inverting the force balance equations (1) requires speciﬁc techniques in 2D, the
same problem reduces in 1D to straightforward integration along the spatial coordinate
[5]. For this reason, we fabricated a micro-patterned ring whose measured mean radius
rmean = 90 µm is larger than its width w = 33 µm, measured the substrate displacement
ﬁeld, and deduced the traction forces exerted by a monolayer of MDCK cells conﬁned
within the ring (Figs. 5a-c, see Experimental Methods for further details). We ﬁnd an
average traction force amplitude texp ≈ 200 Pa for a measurement error of the order of
δtexp ≈ 40 Pa, and deduce a relative error δtexp/texp of the order of 20 %, consistent
with the range of noise amplitudes where BISM was deemed applicable, see Fig. 4. The
height of the monolayer is typically 5.3 ± 1.2 µm (see Sec. 2.4), much smaller than the
spatial extension 2πrmean, and varies smoothly, see Fig. S8 in the Supporting Material. In
Figs. 5d-f, we plot the three stress components as inferred by BISM, with a regularization
parameter Λ(∞) = 6.7 10−6 and a traction force-based measure of accuracy χ2
T = 4.7 10−6,
as deﬁned by Eq. (22). Note that the inferred stresses are mostly positive, even though
the prior distribution is a zero-mean Gaussian, see Fig. 5i.
Since shear stresses are small compared to angular normal stresses |σrθ|,|σθr| (cid:28) |σθθ|,

the orthoradial component of the force balance equation (see ST 1.2 ) simpliﬁes to

∂σθθ
∂θ

= r tθ

(23)

Taking into account the experimental angular resolution ∆θ, and averaging radially over
the width of the ring, we obtain the 1D value of the increment of orthoradial stress over
∆θ:

∆σ1D

θθ = (cid:104)r tθ(cid:105)r ∆θ

The red dashed line corresponds to the zero-mean, Gaussian prior distribution function with

This value is compared with the radially-averaged increment of orthoradial stress inferred
by BISM (cid:104)∆σθθ(cid:105)r (Figs. 5g-h). The excellent agreement found between experimental
((cid:104)r tθ(cid:105)r ∆θ) and inferred ((cid:104)∆σθθ(cid:105)r) 1D stresses is quantiﬁed by a coeﬃcient of determina-

14

ring = 0.99, see Fig. 5h. To check that BISM allows to infer absolute stress values,

tion R2
we calculate the average pressure (cid:104)Pexp(cid:105) from traction force data (see ST 1.4 ):

(cid:104)Pexp(cid:105) =

(cid:104)trr(cid:105)

1
2

(25)

where (cid:104) (cid:105) denotes spatial averaging over the whole domain. We obtain (cid:104)Pexp(cid:105) = −2.18 kPa.µm,
in agreement with the average inferred pressure (cid:104)Pinf(cid:105) = −2.17 ± 0.94 kPa.µm.

We conclude that BISM is readily applicable to experimental traction force data, and
has been validated on experimental data without reference to a speciﬁc rheological model
of the tissue.

3.5 Comparison with monolayer stress microscopy
Monolayer stress microscopy, as introduced in [26], assumes that the cell monolayer is
a linear, isotropic elastic body. Given traction force data, MSM consists in ﬁnding the
stress ﬁeld that minimizes an energy functional of the cell monolayer. MSM is thus
straightforward to implement using FreeFem++ [64], a ﬁnite element software based on
the same variational approach (see ST 1.1 ).

A simpler implementation of MSM, that also assumes an elastic cell monolayer rhe-
ology, has been proposed recently [36]. We call this method MSMu since it does not
require the calculation of traction forces and uses the substrate displacement ﬁeld u as
input data. MSMu further assumes that the displacement ﬁeld u is continuous at the
interface between substrate and cells: tissue internal stresses are computed directly from
substrate displacements. In practice, we calculate substrate displacements from the trac-
tion force data set, given numerical values of the substrate elastic modulus Esub = 5 kPa
and Poisson ratio ν2D sub = 0.5 [36].

By analogy with MSM, we introduce a stress estimation method, named MSMη, that
assumes a viscous rheology for the cell monolayer. Thanks to the variational formulation,
we compute the velocity ﬁeld given the force traction ﬁeld with FreeFem++, and estimate
the stress ﬁeld given numerical values of the viscosity coeﬃcients. Of note, other vari-
ants of MSM could be implemented assuming other tissue rheologies consistent with a
variational formulation [65].

The comparison relies on three numerical simulations: in addition to the Viscous and
Elastic 1 data sets studied above, another simulation of an elastic tissue, named Elastic
2, has been performed, using the elastic coeﬃcients E = 10 kPa µm and ν2D = 0.5, as
advocated in [36]. Each variant of MSM assumes a tissue rheology, and thus relies on a
set of material parameters. To perform MSM and MSMu, we use the same tissue elastic
coeﬃcients as in the Elastic 1 [26] and Elastic 2 [36] simulations respectively. To perform
MSMη, we use the same tissue viscosity coeﬃcients as in the Viscous simulation.

Table 1 summarizes our results and compares the accuracy of the diﬀerent methods (see
also Fig. S9 in the Supporting Material for visual comparison). In all cases, the values of
σ are closer to 1 for BISM, which performs better than MSM, MSMu and MSMη. By
R2
construction, BISM seems less sensitive to experimental noise than deterministic stress
microscopies. For each variant of MSM, accuracy is maximal for the data set generated

Table 1: Comparison with monolayer stress microscopy. Coeﬃcients of determi-

tions). Traction force data sets were obtained with material parameter values
η = 103 kPa µm s, η(cid:48) = η (Viscous); E = 102 kPa µm, ν2D = 0.5 [26] (Elastic 1 ),
E = 10 kPa µm, ν2D = 0.5 [36] (Elastic 2 ). A white noise of relative amplitude
5% is added in all cases.

according to the same rheological hypothesis, i.e. Elastic 1, Elastic 2 and Viscous for
MSM, MSMu and MSMη respectively. Unsurprisingly, a mismatch between numerical
simulation and stress microscopy methods, either in the values of material parameters or
in the choice of a rheology, leads to a lower value of the coeﬃcient of determination.

We also applied MSM to the experimental data set studied in Validation: experimental
data. Following the same protocol, we obtained a larger dispersion of inferred values than
with BISM. The inferred data set obtained by MSM is characterized by a lower coeﬃcient
of determination R2

ring = 0.32, far below the BISM value R2

ring = 0.99.

All existing stress microscopies infer the stress ﬁeld up to an additive null vector σ0
such that div σ0 = 0. Classically [53], null vectors of the linear problem div σ = (cid:126)t are
xy = − ∂2χ
related to the Airy stress function χ through σ0
∂x∂y .
Since BISM infers faithfully the mean stress (cid:104)σ(cid:105) in conﬁned geometries, it limits the
class of undetectable stresses to zero-mean stress ﬁelds that verify both div σ0 = 0 and
the boundary conditions (4). Alternative methods will be necessary to ascertain the
relevance of these special solutions to cell monolayer mechanics.

4 Conclusion

Bayesian inversion stress microscopy estimates the internal stress ﬁeld of a cell monolayer
given traction force data. Validation on both numerical and experimental data shows
that the method works reliably independently of the tissue rheology, of its geometry,
and of the boundary conditions imposed on the stress ﬁeld. As a consequence, BISM
should apply equally well to isolated cell assemblies and to patches of cells within a
larger monolayer. Since the hypotheses made pertain to statistics (Bayesian inversion),
we checked that the method is robust to changes in the underlying statistical model, in
particular to changes in the prior. Importantly, its statistical nature leads to a simple,
natural deﬁnition of an error bar on the stress estimate. It is compatible with the level
of experimental noise and with the spatial resolution typical of traction force microscopy.
Last, BISM is more accurate than MSM, and its accuracy is less sensitive to the rheology
of the tissue than all variants of monolayer stress microscopy. BISM is quite general since

16

it relies on the laws of mechanics and on reasonable and robust statistical assumptions.
It can therefore be applied to other active materials strongly interacting with a soft
substrate, provided that the height of the system is small compared to its planar spatial
extension.

We analyzed traction force images, i.e. spatial data at a given, ﬁxed time. However,
BISM does not rely on an assumption of quasi-stationarity, and would apply equally well
to spatio-temporal data, i.e. to traction force movies. Our preliminary results suggest
that combining Bayesian inversion with Kalman ﬁltering then further improves accuracy.
To date, the modeling of cell monolayer mechanics typically relies on a forward ap-
proach: assumptions made on tissue rheology are validated indirectly through predictions
made on (measurable) tissue kinematics. A reliable measurement of the internal stress
ﬁeld paves the way to inverse approaches, where the combination of stress with kine-
matic data, such as the strain rate ﬁeld or the cell-neighbour exchange rate ﬁeld, would
allow to read out constitutive equations from data, and to infer the values of material
parameters.

1 Computational aspects

1.1 Numerical simulations
We use the ﬁnite element software FreeFem++ [64] to solve numerically the conservation
equations and generate stress and traction force data for several rheologies (viscous and
elastic) and several geometries (square and disc). FreeFem++ requires the weak formu-
lation of evolution equations. The momentum conservation equation div σ = (cid:126)t reads in
variational form

where (cid:126)w is a vector test function and Ω is the domain of integration. The boundary
conditions σ · (cid:126)n = (cid:126)0, where (cid:126)n denotes the vector normal to the edge, are implemented
through an extra term integrated over the boundary δΩ

Viscous liquid
The constitutive equation of a viscous, compressible liquid reads [66]

(cid:16)(cid:126)∇(cid:126)v + ((cid:126)∇(cid:126)v)t(cid:17)

+ η(cid:48) (cid:16)(cid:126)∇.(cid:126)v

(cid:17)

I

σ = η

where η and η(cid:48) are the shear and compression coeﬃcients of viscosity. Taking into account
friction with the substrate, with a friction coeﬃcient ξv, and a motility force ﬁeld (cid:126)fact,
the total traction force (cid:126)t reads

(cid:126)t = ξv (cid:126)v − (cid:126)fact

The active force (cid:126)fact is generated by nd force dipoles randomly distributed in space, see
below.

Using the momentum conservation equation, we obtain an equation on (cid:126)v

−η∆(cid:126)v − (η + η(cid:48)) (cid:126)∇((cid:126)∇.(cid:126)v) + ξv(cid:126)v = (cid:126)fact

whose weak form reads

We solve this equation for the velocity ﬁeld with FreeFem++ on a 100 × 100 µm2 square
with boundary conditions σ · (cid:126)n = (cid:126)0, and with material parameter values typical of cell
monolayers: ξv = 100 kPa µm−1s [7], η = 103 kPa µm s [62], η(cid:48) = η. To the best of our
knowledge, the second coeﬃcient of viscosity η(cid:48) has not been measured in a tissue, but
theoretical reasoning suggests η(cid:48) = 2 η for a thin monolayer, due to 3D incompressibility
[67]. The stress and traction force ﬁelds are derived from the velocity ﬁeld and sampled
over a regular cartesian grid with C = R = 50 and N = C × R = 2500 (see Fig. 3a-b).

23

Elastic solid
In the limit of small deformations, the constitutive equation of an elastic body reads [53]

(cid:16)(cid:126)∇(cid:126)u + ((cid:126)∇(cid:126)u)t(cid:17)

σ = µ

+ λ ((cid:126)∇.(cid:126)u) I

with Lamé coeﬃcients λ, µ. With a (solid) friction force proportional to the displacement,
the traction force reads (cid:126)t = ξu(cid:126)u − (cid:126)fact, and the momentum conservation equation

−µ∆(cid:126)u − (µ + λ) (cid:126)∇((cid:126)∇.(cid:126)u) + ξu(cid:126)u = (cid:126)fact

is formally identical to that obtained for the ﬂow of a viscous liquid, substituting (cid:126)v by (cid:126)u
and the material parameters η, η(cid:48), ξv by µ, λ, ξu. The numerical resolution is therefore
similar to that described above for a viscous liquid. Parameter values diﬀer: for instance
a realistic Poisson ratio ν2D = λ

λ+2µ = 0.5 imposes λ = 2µ.

Active forces
The active force (cid:126)fact is generated by nd force dipoles deﬁned in tensor form as

(cid:1)(cid:3) δ((cid:126)x − (cid:126)xn), n = 1, . . . , nd

dev ( cos2θn sin2θn
sin2θn −cos2θn
tr and pn

with positions (cid:126)xn, amplitudes pn
dev for the trace and deviator, and orientations θn.
The dipole positions (cid:126)xn and orientations θn are random variables uniformly distributed
over the spatial domain Ω and [0, 2π] respectively.
In practice, the force dipoles are
implemented using a ﬁnite-size Gaussian approximation of the delta function, with a
spatial extension 2d = 10 µm of the order of a typical cell size. The components of the
active force read

nd(cid:88)

fact,i((cid:126)x) =

∂jpn

ij((cid:126)x)

with nd = 100 force dipoles of typical amplitude 10−2 kPa [32]. Since the amplitude of
traction forces is known to be larger close to the edge than in the bulk, the coeﬃcients
dev are set proportional to 1 + r/lp, where r is the distance to the center of the
tr and pn
pn
domain and lp = 5 µm is a penetration length [32].

n=1

MSM implementation
Monolayer stress microscopy [26] consists in ﬁnding, given traction force data, the dis-
placement ﬁeld (cid:126)u that veriﬁes the force balance equation obtained for a purely elastic
stress. Thanks to the hypothesis made on tissue rheology, the problem becomes well-
posed since two components of the displacement vector are deduced from two components
of the traction force vector. Once (cid:126)u is known, the calculation of the stress depends on
the numerical values of tissue elastic coeﬃcients. We implement MSM with FreeFem++,

1.2 Polar coordinates
For cell monolayers conﬁned within a ring, or within a disk, we use the polar coordinate

system (r, θ). The force balance equations for the stress tensor ﬁeld σ =(cid:0) σrr σθr
the traction force ﬁeld (cid:126)T =(cid:0) tr

where, as for the cartesian coordinate system, we do not enforce the symmetry of the
stress tensor.

When discretizing the derivatives with respect to r and θ to lowest order, the (cartesian)

expression (8) for the matrix A is no longer valid and must be replaced by

A(r,θ) =(cid:0) Ar/r −I/r Aθ/r

0 Aθ/r I/r Ar/r

(cid:1)

0

where Ar and Aθ are sub-matrices that correspond to the discretized forms of the partial
derivatives ∂

∂r r and ∂

∂θ respectively.

1.3 Grids
Numerical data
In order to implement the mechanics of a rectangular piece of tissue on a grid Gi with
C columns for the x coordinate and R rows for the y coordinate of traction force data,
in reality we need to simulate a grid Gs with 2R + 1 rows and 2C + 1 columns, with
two traction force components and four stress components at each point (see Fig. 1b).
We extract from the odd-numbered columns and even-numbered rows the σxx and σyx
components ((C + 1) × R values), from the even-numbered columns and odd-numbered
rows the σyy and σxy components (C×(R+1) values) and ﬁnally from the even-numbered
columns and even-numbered rows the tx and ty values (C × R values). When plotting
the stress ﬁeld, each stress component is interpolated (second order interpolation in l)
at a position at the center of each grid cell to obtain the required C × R values. We use
the same method in polar coordinates, replacing x by θ and y by r.

25

Experimental data
Irrespective of the method, each experimental traction force data point is associated with
a given cell of the measurement grid Gm. We need to interpolate these experimental
values on a regular grid Gi, either cartesian or polar depending on the geometry. For
each cell of the numerical grid Gi, we ﬁrst calculate the areas of intersection with cells of
the initial grid Gm, and compute an average, weighted by these areas, over the traction
forces in the cells of Gm with a non-zero overlap. This procedure yields the traction force
in the cell of Gi, which we use for stress inference.

1.4 Average stress from traction force data
Spatially averaged values of stress components can be calculated directly from traction
force data assuming the boundary condition σij nj = 0. For completeness sake, we
adapt here the classical derivation [53] to the calculation of the average pressure in polar
coordinates.

We use cartesian coordinates (x1, x2) = (x, y), and summation over repeated indices

is assumed throughout. Multiplying both terms of the force balance equation

2 Robustness

We describe here the variations performed on BISM in order to test its robustness, by
varying one by one each feature of the statistical model (Secs. 2.1), and of the numerical
simulation (Sec. 2.2). Precise deﬁnitions and implementations of the statistical models
are given in Sec. 2.3.

2.1 Robustness to variations of the statistical model

Variations made on the prior are the following.

(i) Distribution of the stress

P1 Laplace prior: amounts to regularization with a L1 norm [68].
P2 Smoothness prior: penalizes spatial variations of the stress ﬁeld [42].
P3 Unequal standard deviations str

P4 Non-zero mean value of the stress: σ0 =(cid:0) σ0xx σ0yx

0 (cid:54)= sdev

(cid:1).

σ0xy σ0yy

for the trace and deviator of the stress.

(ii) Equality of the shear components

P5 Not enforced: αxy = 0 in Eq. (10).

(iii) Boundary conditions

P6 Not enforced: αBC = 0 in Eq. (10).

Further, we implement the following variations.

S1 Inverse-Gamma hyperprior distribution: a weakly informative, but proper

hyperprior for s2 and s2

0 [57].

S2 Student likelihood distribution: admits tails fatter than Gaussian.
S3 Expectation-Maximization algorithm: optimizes a likelihood function that de-

pends on "latent" variables, here s2 and s2

0 [69].

Table S1 lists the values of R2

data sets as for BISM. Values of 1 − R2
therefore omitted.

2.2 Robustness to variations of the numerical simulation
Variations made on the numerical simulations are the following.
N1 Material parameters: keeping ξ = 100 kPa µm−1s and η = 103 kPa µm s, we vary

η(cid:48): η(cid:48) = 10−1 η (N1 −); η(cid:48) = 101 η (N1 +).

N2 Elastic rheology: with a Young modulus E = 102 kPa µm [62, 70], a Poisson ratio

ν2D = 0.5 [34]) and a (solid) friction coeﬃcient ξu = 1 kPa µm−1 [71].

N3 No-slip boundary conditions: (cid:126)v = (cid:126)0 at the edge instead of σ · (cid:126)n = (cid:126)0, with αBC = 0.
N4 Subsystem of a larger tissue: central part of size R× C of a system of size 3R× 3C,

with αBC = 0, since the boundary conditions on the subsystem are unknown.

Table S2 lists the values of R2
σ obtained by applying BISM to the traction force ﬁeld
obtained from each of these numerical simulations. We also study the inﬂuence of spatial
resolution and of the amplitude of measurement noise on the accuracy of inference, see
Fig. 4.

2.3 Statistical models
2.3.1 Laplace prior distribution (P1)

Since MAP estimation is untractable analytically with a Laplace prior, we use a hierarchi-
cal construction [72]. A multivariate Laplace distribution of parameter λ and covariance
matrix 2B/λ is obtained by compounding a Gaussian distribution N ((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)0, s2

2.3.2 Smoothness prior distribution (P2)
We naturally expect the tissue stress ﬁeld to be a smooth function of space. This infor-
mation can be embedded in the prior distribution function [46, 42], by penalizing large
spatial gradients: (variation P2 ):

(cid:34)

πs((cid:126)σ) ∝ exp

− l2(cid:107) (cid:126)∇σ(cid:107)2 + α2

Discretizing the gradient operator to ﬁrst order in l leads to a modiﬁed eﬀective covariance
matrix Bs with πs((cid:126)σ) = N ((cid:126)σ | (cid:126)0, S0 s = s2
0 Bs). The iteration rule (19-20) is unchanged.

2.3.3 Inverse-Gamma hyperprior distribution (S1)
A natural alternative to the non-informative, improper Jeﬀreys’ distribution for the hy-
perprior is the weakly informative, proper inverse-Gamma distribution

Varying , the accuracy of inference is excellent as long as  < max ≈ 3 10−1. Above this
value, the bias brought by the ﬁnite mean value of s2 and s2
0 compromises the inference.

2.3.4 Student likelihood distribution (S2)

A simple choice of a zero-mean distribution with tails fatter than Gaussian is the non
standardized Student distribution St(ν, 0, γ). It admits a Gaussian limit St(ν, 0, γ) →
N (0, γ) as ν → ∞, and has a ﬁnite variance νγ

ν−2 if ν > 2.

tion H(s2 | γ, ν) = IG(cid:0) ν

To implement a Student likelihood function in a tractable way, we use again a hierar-
chical approach [73] (see Fig. S2b). The Student distribution St(ν, 0, γ) is obtained by
compounding a Gaussian distribution N ( (cid:126)T | A(cid:126)σ, s2 I) with an inverse-Gamma distribu-
γ ,

2.3.5 Expectation-maximization algorithm (S3)

When performing Tikhonov regularization, the optimal regularization parameter is

prior norm (cid:126)σt
Superposing on the L-curve the points obtained by iteration, we ﬁnd excellent agreement
between the two methods. MAP estimation is more economical computationally since
only a few points are needed to determine the optimal parameters. Successive iterations
displace the representative circles towards smaller values of the residual norm along the L-
curve. In order to obtain convergence, we need to start from initial conditions located on
the right hand side of the apex. The representative circle runs away towards unphysically
small values of Λ when starting from initial conditions located on the left hand side of
the apex. Another advantage of MAP estimation is to determine self-consistently the

circles in (a) and (c) correspond respectively to the initial condition and to successive iterative
steps

soon as Λ < 10−3, and that further decreasing Λ no longer improves accuracy. BISM is
robust against variations of the ratio s2/s2
0 provided that the weight given to information
contained in the prior is small enough.

This pattern describes faithfully the convergence of the resolution method for most
of the statistical models and numerical data sets we investigated: convergence occurs
within a few steps towards optimal values of the regularization parameter in the range
[10−6, 10−3], see Table S3.

Variations P6, N3 and N4, which correspond to changes related to boundary con-
ditions, diﬀer in the following way. The resolution method converges fast, but to an
unphysically small value of Λ(∞) (of the order of 10−38 for N3, see Fig. S4a). Since
the coeﬃcient of determination still plateaus close to 1 when Λ < 10−2 (Fig. S4b), se-
lecting an early step (typically k = 3) for inference works well, and gives the value
Λ(∞) = 1.0 10−9.

However, setting s2 to a constant value and ignoring Eq. (19) allows to self-consistently
determine s2
0 iteratively using Eq. (20) only. When dealing with experimental data, a
natural estimate of s is the experimental error bar on traction force data. For the
numerical data sets P6, N3 and N4, we use s2 = 10−3 kPa2 ≈ s2
exp, the noise amplitude
0 (k) exhibit rapid convergence towards
(see Table S3). For N3, iterations over (cid:126)σΠ (k) and s2
Λ(∞) = 1.9 10−3 (see Fig. S4c), on the plateau of the R2
σ(Λ) curve. In this case, error
bars δˆσ on the inferred stress are less meaningful since they depend on the numerical
value used for s2. Of course if s2 is ﬁxed by the experiment then error bars are more
reliable. Due to the large plateau of the R2
σ(Λ) curve, both parameter determination
methods yield the same results.

3.2 Hyperparameters αxy and αBC
In principle the values of αxy and αBC could also be determined self-consistently. For
simplicity, we set these hyperparameters to constant, large values.

In order to determine which hyperparameter values will ensure that stress tensor sym-
metry and boundary conditions are respected, we perform BISM on the Viscous data set
for a large range [1, 104] of ﬁxed values of αxy and αBC. In addition to R2
σ, we deﬁne
the partial prior norms Nxy = (cid:107)(cid:126)σxy − (cid:126)σyx(cid:107)2 and NBC = (cid:107)(cid:126)σBC(cid:107)2 as speciﬁc measures of
accuracy. Fig. S5a shows how R2
σ and Nxy vary as a function of αxy. The partial prior
norm Nxy decreases with αxy. Above αxy (cid:39) 10, Nxy becomes smaller than the reference
