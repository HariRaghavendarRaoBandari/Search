Abstract

Titan, with its thick, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, has been seen from satellite and
terrestrial observations to harbour methane clouds. To investigate whether atmospheric
features such as clouds could also be visible from the surface of Titan, data taken with the
Side Looking Imager (SLI) on-board the Huygens probe after landing have been analysed
to identify any potential atmospheric features.
In total, 82 SLI images were calibrated,
processed and examined for features. The calibrated images show a smooth vertical radiance
gradient across the images, with no other discernible features. After mean-frame subtraction,
six images contained an extended, horizontal feature that had a radiance value that lay
outside the 95% conﬁdence limit of the predicted radiance when compared to regions higher
and lower in the images. The change in optical depth of these features were found to be
between 0.005 and 0.014.
It is considered that these features most likely originate from
the presence of a fog bank close to the horizon that rises and falls during the period of
observation.

1. Introduction

Titan is a unique body in the Solar System as the only moon harbouring a thick atmo-
sphere (see discussions and further details in Roe, 2012 and Lorenz and Mitton, 2008 and
references therein). This atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (> 90%), followed by
methane (5%) and smaller fractions of other components (Roe, 2012; Gibbard et al., 1999).
The atmospheric pressure at the surface was measured by the Huygens Atmosphere Struc-
ture Instrument (HASI) on-board the Huygens Probe to be 1.467(1) × 105 Pa (Fulchignoni
et al., 2005). The lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of Titan allows for the production
of complex organic molecules, such as poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Waite et al.,
2007). Complex hydrocarbon aerosols, commonly known as tholins, are thought to result in
the dense orange haze that is characteristic of Titan’s atmosphere and obscures the surface
from view at visible wavelengths. The optical depth of the atmospheric haze is dependent
on both wavelength and altitude: optical depth varies for a given point between 2 and 4.5

between ∼ 450 − 950 nm and can increase by a factor of 2 between 150 km and the surface
(Tomasko et al., 2005).

Methane cycling, similar to the hydrological-cycling occurring on Earth, has been hy-
pothesised to occur on Titan. Tokano et al. (2001) carried out in-depth 3-dimensional global
circulation modelling of the tropospheric methane cycle, showing that methane cycling pre-
dominantly occurs within Titan’s atmosphere. Surface darkening on Titan, consistent with
surface wettening by methane precipitation, has been observed (Barnes et al., 2013; Turtle
et al., 2011). Methane clouds have been detected from both terrestrial telescope observations
(e.g. Griﬃth et al., 2000; Roe et al., 2005) and satellite observations (e.g. Brown et al.,
2010; Rodriguez et al., 2011) at a variety of altitudes. Transient methane condensation
clouds were also detected by Griﬃth et al. (1998), at altitudes of 15 km. Cloud features
have been detected from the surface of other planetary bodies (e.g. Moores et al., 2015),
thus it is possible that cloud features could also be observed from the surface of Titan.

The Huygens probe, carried on-board the Cassini Spacecraft, arrived at Saturn on July
1st 2004 after a seven year journey from Earth. The Huygens probe was released from
Cassini on December 25th 2004 and began its descent through the atmosphere of Titan
on January 14th 2005. The probe descended through the atmosphere for 2.5 hours before
landing on Titan’s surface. The Huygens probe continued to take measurements and relay
data for a further hour after landing (Tomasko et al., 2005).

In this paper, we present the results of an investigation of data taken with the Descent
Imager/Spectrometer Radiometer (DISR, Tomasko et al., 2002) on-board the Huygens probe
to search for features, such as clouds and mirages, in the lower atmosphere of Titan as viewed
from the surface.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Instrument and data

The DISR on-board Huygens is made up of a number of diﬀerent sub-instruments to
collect a variety of measurements at optical wavelengths. Three of these sub-instruments
are imagers: the High Resolution Imager (HRI), the Medium Resolution Imager (MRI) and
the Side Looking Imager (SLI). These three imagers observe in diﬀerent directions and have
diﬀering resolutions and ﬁelds of view: the SLI has the largest ﬁeld of view with the lowest
resolution and the HRI has the smallest ﬁeld of view with the highest resolution. A summary
of the speciﬁcations of these imagers can be found in Table 2 of Tomasko et al. (2002).
The three aforementioned imagers share a 512 × 520 pixel silicon CCD detector with
three other sub-instruments (UVLS, DVLS, SA Radiometer). Half of the CCD is masked
and used as a “memory region”. Of the remaining half, the majority is used by the three
imagers. A schematic layout of the CCD detector can be found in Fig. 1 of Tomasko et al.
(2002).

Throughout the descent, the imagers took observations and continued to take images
once the probe had landed on the surface. The total number of images received from the
probe from the HRI, MRI and SLI instruments was 601.

2

Only images taken with the Side Looking Imager (SLI) were analysed, as data taken with
the High Resolution Imager (HRI) and Medium Resolution Imager (MRI) did not include
images of the sky. As detailed in Tomasko et al. (2002), the SLI had a Nadir range of 45.2-
96.0° with an azimuth angle range of 25.6°. The ﬁeld of view includes 6° of image above the
horizon. The spectral range of all three imagers was 660-1000nm and the SLI had a pixel
format of 128 × 256 pixels with a spatial scale of 0.2° per pixel.

The data from all three imagers were retrieved from the European Space Agency (ESA)
Planetary Science Archive1. The SLI data were separated using the accompanying header
ﬁles and those taken after landing - totalling 82 images - extracted manually.
The data retrieved from the Planetary Science Archive are available in two forms, binary
tables (128× 256 pixels) and binary image ﬁles (256× 512 pixels). For the remainder of the
paper, the data referred to are those from the binary table ﬁles.

2.2. Calibration

The SLI data underwent a number of calibration and processing steps both on-board
Huygens and on the ground prior to the data archiving. These steps are described in detail
in the calibration report provided with the archive data (Doose et al., 2001) and will be
summarised here.

On board Huygens, a bad pixel map was used to replace the value of bad pixels with
the value of another pixel in the same row. A ﬂat-ﬁeld correction was applied to remove
a number of image artifacts, including a “chicken wire” pattern caused by the optical ﬁbre
unit. The data were taken in 12 bits per pixel format, but were only able to be transmitted
at 8 bits per pixel. Thus, square root processing was used to map the 12 bit data to 8 bit
data. For the MRI and HRI instruments, the algorithm was implemented in an adaptive
form to improve the representation of the data, but as the SLI images included the sky, this
was not applied. The image data contained hot pixels which would have had a detrimental
impact on the quality of the transmitted data, therefore hot pixels were replaced. Prior
to transmission, the data were compressed in 16 × 16 pixel blocks using a discrete cosine
function.

After the data were received on Earth, further processing took place. The 8 bits per pixel
data were mapped back to 12 bits per pixel using a reverse square root processing algorithm.
The images were also decompressed, although the compression carried out on-board is not
completely reversible.

The data were retrieved from the Planetary Science Archive in this state.

In order
to retrieve radiometrically calibrated data for use in further analyses, further calibration
processes were required - these are also explained in further detail in Doose et al. (2001).
The dark current after the initial 40 minutes of descent is negligible (Tomasko et al., 2002),
therefore a value of 8 data numbers (DN) was added to each pixel to undo the estimated
dark current removal on-board. The exposure times of the observations varied between 2
and 50 ms; to compensate for this, each of the images was divided by its respective exposure

time. The absolute responsivity, A, at the CCD instrument temperature (ranging between
approximately 170-185 K) at the time each dataset was collected was computed using the
model found in Doose et al. (2001):

A = −3729544.2 + 78230.288T − 501.89048T 2
+1.4119032T 3 − 0.0014748198T 4

(1)

where T is the CCD temperature at the time of observation (K) and A is in units of

counts s−1 W−1 m2 Sr.

After processing and calibration is complete, the pixel values are returned in units of

radiance within the observing band of the detector.

2.3. Analysis

The ﬁnal image set comprises of 82 calibrated images; these were analysed in a number
of ways to identify the presence of atmospheric features. Animated gifs were created at each
point to aid in manual feature identiﬁcation. All combinations of the following procedures
were applied to the data in order to identify the presence, signiﬁcance and potential origin
of atmospheric features.

• The images were cropped to the region between 4 and 40 pixels from the upper edge and
7 and 14 pixels from the left and right edges respectively. This region constitutes the
portion of the original images containing the sky with edge-related artifacts removed.
• A mean frame was produced from all images and subsequently subtracted from each

image. This enhances edges and compression-related artifacts.

• A Gaussian ﬁlter (Python’s scipy Gaussian ﬁlter function with a kernel size of one

to ﬁve) was applied to smooth the variations caused by compression artifacts.

• Temporally consecutive images were co-added in pairs to reduce the image noise.
• Diﬀerence imaging was applied to temporally consecutive pairs of images. The second
image was subtracted from the ﬁrst to identify any changes that had occurred between
images.

An example image with a selection of the aforementioned processes applied is shown in
Fig. 1. The elevation angle has been measured assuming that the lower edge of the cropped
image represents the horizon. The azimuth angle has been calculated under the assumption
that the centre of the image is at an azimuthal angle of 193◦ east of north (Karkoschka
et al., 2007). Unless otherwise stated, all analysis from this point onward is carried out on
images which have been calibrated, cropped and (where mentioned) mean-frame subtracted
and smoothed. Coadding and diﬀerence imaging gave no further detections on the data than
those found using mean-frame subtraction from individual images and thus were not used
further.

Results

3.1. Radiance measurements

The calibrated frames with no further processing show no distinct structure or evidence
of clouds, mirages or artifacts. There is a general change in radiance vertically across all
images. This variation is expected and has been observed on other planetary bodies with
atmospheres, such as Mars.

On Titan, the radiance increases with elevation angle making the sky darkest at the
horizon. This is demonstrated in Fig 2. The apparent horizon after landing was found to be
1 − 2◦ above the theoretical horizon, taking into account the pitch of Huygens after landing
- believed to be evidence of a small rise (Karkoschka et al., 2007). Assuming the multiple
scattering in the atmosphere results in an absorption proﬁle, this can be ﬁtted using:

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

−

I =

(2)
where F is the Solar ﬂux (W m−2) at the surface of Titan, I is the radiance (W m−2 Sr−1), τ
is the total vertical optical depth of the atmosphere, and C is a constant. α is the measured
elevation angle from the lower edge of the image and the addition of 2◦ compensates for the
apparent-to-true horizon discrepancy.

sin(α + 2◦)

+ C

The genetic algorithm Pikaia (Charbonneau, 1995) was used to ﬁt the data and resulted
in a τ = 0.26316, F = 0.81229 and C = 0.06229. The value of the Solar ﬂux at the surface of
Titan agrees well with the value of the Solar constant scaled to the distance of Titan at the
time of the Huygens landing (9.053052 AU, as generated by the New Horizons Ephermeris2
at noon on January 14 2005) and attenuated to the surface with an optical depth of 3:
Fscaled = 0.8292 W m−2. The model ﬁt is shown in Fig. 2(a). The model has good
agreement with the data from an elevation of 2◦ upwards. Below 2◦, the model has a higher
radiance than that of the data, suggesting that an additional absorption is occurring in this
region, perhaps due to the presence of ground fog. Changing the horizon oﬀset from 2◦
shifts the model line vertically. Varying C allows each horizon oﬀset to be compensated
for, allowing an acceptable ﬁt to the data to be made whilst keeping all other parameters
constant. However, as the reported apparent-to-true horizon discrepancy is 2◦, this is the
value used in this analysis.

The large-scale gradient common across all images was removed using meanframe sub-
traction. This allowed small scale variations to be examined. However, as well as empha-
sising small image variations, mean frame subtraction has the side-eﬀect of emphasising
low-level image artifacts, which is shown clearly in Fig. 3(a). These variations were sup-
pressed using the Gaussian ﬁlter function in python and the eﬀect shown in Fig. 3(b).

Extended, horizontal linear features were detected in six images. These features were
only detected after mean-frame subtraction, coaddition of frames or diﬀerence imaging was
applied. Each frame with a detected atmospheric feature is shown in Fig. 4 after mean-
frame subtraction and Gaussian blurring with a kernel size of 3. A representative frame

either lighter or darker than the rest of the frame at approximately 3◦ elevation.
The radiance of the feature was measured as the mean value in a 6×6 pixel square region,
the centre of which was selected manually. The radiance of the background was taken as the
average value in two 6 × 6 pixel square regions, the centres of which were vertically oﬀset
from the central pixel of the feature region by 10 pixels. The radiance measurements were
carried out at three diﬀerent azimuth angles across the image, shown for an example feature-
detection image in Fig. 5. These regions were selected as representative of the feature’s high,
low and medium radiance values. The diﬀerence in radiance between the feature region and
the mean of the background regions is shown in Table 1. The value in parentheses indicates
the 95% conﬁdence limit on the ﬁnal digit. This has been calculated as:

CL =

1.96σ√
N

(3)

where σ is the standard deviation across the meanframe subtracted image and N is the
number of pixels in each region (36). The standard deviation across the entire meanframe
subtracted image was chosen rather than the standard deviation of the region as the former
will take into account any larger scale variations in background across the frame. The conﬁ-
dence limits calculated in this fashion are in excellent agreement with estimated conﬁdence
limits from the signal-to-noise ratio of the DISR imager: the compression algorithm was
designed to give an image with a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 100 (L. Doose, priv. comm.),
thus from a 36 pixel region, where each pixel has radiance ∼ 0.06, the 95% conﬁdence limit
on the mean value in the region is ∼ 2 × 10−4.

3.2. Optical depth estimates

Assuming that the feature is suﬃciently optically thin that any change in radiance can
be accounted for in a linear fashion, the change in optical depth of the feature with respect
to its predicted value from the background regions, ∆τ , is given by:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

F

∆τ = − ln

1 − 4π∆I

(4)

where F is the Solar ﬂux at the surface of Titan and ∆I is the diﬀerence between the feature
and the predicted radiance from background regions in the mean-frame subtracted images.
The calculated values of ∆I can be found in column 7 of Table 1. The Solar ﬂux was taken
as 0.8123 W m−2, as found from ﬁtting the background radiance gradient - see Sect. 3.1.

The calculated values of ∆τ are shown in the ﬁnal column of Table 1.

4. Discussion

4.1. Reliability of detection

In more than half of the selected feature regions with no mean frame subtraction or
Gaussian smoothing, the radiance of the feature region lies more than the measured 95%
conﬁdence interval from the predicted radiance from the mean background measurements.

In addition, the feature is extended in every image, further compounding the reliability of
detection. In the mean-frame subtracted images, in all cases the radiance of the feature lies
outside the measured 95% conﬁdence interval of the predicted background level. These are
shown for image 0979 (MT 11185.34 sec) in Fig. 6. The regions referred to are shown in
Fig. 5.

Comparisons of the detections as a function of time have also been investigated. Fig. 7
shows the residual of the radiance of the feature region and the mean of two background
regions centred 10 pixels above and below the feature region as a function of time. This time
period covers the entire SLI ground imagery available. In this ﬁgure, for ease of visibility,
the feature region has been taken as a horizontal strip across the entire image with a height
of 6 pixels and its vertical position is held constant in all images. The background regions
are also 6 pixel wide strips held constant across all images. The images with detections are
shown in red with all other images shown in black. Four of the images have signiﬁcantly non
zero residuals averaged across the image strip (error bars state the 95% conﬁdence limits).
The remaining two detections which are not signiﬁcantly outside the zero residual region are
the initial two detections (MT: 11009.76 and 11013.18 seconds) which have shapes that are
more vertically variable, meaning that a single horizontal strip across the entire image does
not capture primarily the feature region and rather a mixture of feature and non-feature
regions. Time series plots of control regions are shown in Fig. 8.

The feature could be an artifact of the detector or introduced during calibration, reduc-
tion or compression of the data. This is considered reasonably unlikely as detector features
are extensively examined in Doose et al. (2001) and no features resembling this one are
observed. Additionally, compression artifacts are seen in linear patterns as shown in Fig.
1(c), whereas this feature does not follow this pattern. An electrical wave across the CCD
cannot be excluded as a potential cause of the feature, although this is fairly unlikely as it
is only seen in a small subset of images.

A number of other events of note have been reported both before and after the Huygens
touchdown3. The ﬁrst feature detection is observed ∼ 1000 s after the potential dewdrop
detection of Karkoschka and Tomasko (2009) and at a similar time to the increase in CO2
detected by GCMS (Niemann et al., 2010). The last feature detection is made ∼600 s prior
to the end of the Cassini-probe link.

4.3. Feature origin

The observed feature has several potential origins. As clouds have been detected in
Titan’s atmosphere at a variety of altitudes, it is possible that this feature is caused by a
low-level cloud. However, the feature has a similar morphology throughout the observations
which are separated by up to 23 minutes and the feature does not appear to exhibit system-
atic movement across the ﬁeld of view. It has been shown (e.g. Kloos et al., 2015 on Mars)
that cloud movement can be detected from surface observations on time spans of less than
a minute. The observations presented in this work are of lower resolution than Kloos et al.
(2015), but detectable, systematic movement would be expected. Taking a cloud height
equal to the depth of the planetary boundary layer (300 m Tokano et al., 2006), a wind
speed of 0.1 ms−1 (Tokano et al., 2006) and assuming the cloud moves perpendicular to the
viewing direction, the time it would take a cloud to pass across the entire ﬁeld of view is
1380 s. This is longer than the length of time between the two detection clusters. With
a higher wind speed of 0.76 ms−1, the meridional speed component of Huygens at 250m
altitude reported by Karkoschka (2015), the time to traverse the frame entirely would be
182 s, which is shorter than the time between the two clusters of detections. Thus, this
theory is unlikely but cannot be entirely discounted.

The observed feature could originate from a background hill or rise that is mostly ob-
scured by the atmospheric haze. Karkoschka et al. (2007) has produced projections of the
region surrounding the Huygens Landing (their Fig. 2). This ﬁgure shows a number of raised
areas. The highlands in the north are estimated to be 150-200 m high, thus our feature,
which would likely lie in the closer lower region, would have to be lower in elevation than
this. The observed feature on the image lies approximately 25 pixels higher than the horizon.
The whole image is 256 pixels in height and spans a ﬁeld of view of 51°. From geometry, if
the centre of the feature was at a radial distance from the probe of 50 m or 100 m and was
caused by a vertical rise, it would have a vertical height of 4 m or 8 m above the observed
ground respectively. Taking into account the 1-2 m rise at the horizon, the total height could
be as high as 9 or 10 m above the ground at closest radial distance. The horizon, according
to Karkoschka et al. (2007), is at a radial distance of 30 m from the probe, thus this would
be a reasonable distance. A light feature is observed in Fig. 2 of Karkoschka et al. (2007) in
the projected ﬁeld of view of the DISR instrument at approximately this distance. Therefore
this could be a reasonable explanation for the image feature, but atmospheric eﬀects such
as a change in fog opacity, would be required to hide and then display the feature.

The feature could be due to the presence of a superior mirage. Mirages form over surfaces
that are either hotter or colder than the air above them, causing the density and subsequently
the refractive index of the air to change with height. Above surfaces that are warmer than
the air, inferior mirages can form: light rays are bent upwards towards the observer causing
the image to appear below the object. Superior mirages, where the image appears above
the object, are formed above surfaces that are colder than the surrounding air and thus
require the presence of a temperature inversion. Further details on mirages can be found in
Greenler (1989) and Lehn and Friesen (1992).

The feature in the images of Titan’s atmosphere, if a mirage, would be a superior mirage
as it appears above the horizon. The Huygens probe measured the atmospheric temperature
throughout the descent and would have detected a temperature inversion. The fully reduced
temperature data, corrected for local atmospheric eﬀects as described in Colombatti and
Ferri (2004), were taken from the European Space Agency’s Planetary Science Archive4.
The data for the last 2km and 500m of the descent are shown in Fig. 9. As is shown,
there is no detection of a temperature inversion and the surface temperature as measured
by HASI is 93.65 ± 0.25 K (Fulchignoni et al., 2005), which is higher than the measured air
temperature before the probe landed. It is possible, however, that a localised temperature
inversion exists some distance from the probe’s landing site which could cause the mirage.
Analyses of the Huygens’ gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) data by Lorenz
et al. (2006) showed that the observed temperature evolution after impact on the surface of
Titan of the heated GCMS inlet required a heat sink to be present. This is consistent with the
heat sink produced if the ground in which the inlet of the GCMS was embedded was a sand
or clay dampened by liquid hydrocarbons. The aforementioned potential dewdrop detection
was made by Karkoschka and Tomasko (2009) from surface imagery and the GCMS detected
methane, ethane and acetylene, amongst other compounds, on the surface (see Niemann
et al., 2010 for further details). Evaporation of surface volatiles has been suggested as the
cause of both an attenuation in signal strength observed by the speed-of-sound instrument
(Lorenz et al., 2014) and the sudden drop in apparent permittivity, detected with PWA-
MIP (Hamelin et al., 2015). Evaporation of surface liquid could cause a loss of latent heat,
leading to surface cooling similar to the situation over a lake where superior mirages are
often seen on Earth.

The most likely explanation for the observed feature is the presence of a fog bank.
Fog had been hypothesised to exist on Titan and subsequently detected at its South Pole
(Brown et al., 2009). A fog bank could vary reasonably quickly with time:
from three-
6Dt where D is the
dimensional diﬀusion, the mean distance travelled by a particle is
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (7.4 × 10−3 m2s−1, Tokano et al., 2006) and t is the time in seconds
(Landau and Lifshitz, 2013). For t = 800 s, the approximate time between the dark and
light detections, the mean particle distance travelled is ∼ 6 m or, at a distance of 30 m, a
change in elevation angle of 11◦. The calculated feature optical depths are also consistent
with what would be expected from a fog bank or thin cloud (Moores et al., 2015). Mean-

frame subtraction would remove the constant fog region leaving detections only at the upper
edge when there is movement, likely resulting in a linear feature. The detections would
cluster in time with the fog bank’s movements: detections with the feature brighter than the
background would appear when the fog bank falls and detections with the feature darker than
the background would appear when the fog bank rises. This behaviour is observed in this
work: the three images with dark features are seen clustered in time, the three images with
bright features are seen clustered in time and there is a gap in detections of approximately
20 minutes between the two clusters. The presence of the fog bank may persist for longer
than the timespan of detections. In this case, the fog bank would be stationary in this time
period and thus undetectable in mean frame subtraction.

The mean-frame would show the presence of a fog bank by a larger decrease in radiance
with decreasing elevation compared with that expected from the atmospheric scattering. Fig.
2(a) shows that this is observed in the mean frame, with an average decrease in radiance of
approximately 0.002-0.003 from the model value. This diﬀerence is similar to the change in
radiance observed between the most intense feature regions and the predicted background,
further supporting this theory.

5. Conclusions

This paper presents the results of an investigation into image data taken with the SLI
imager on-board the Huygens probe after it landed on the surface of Titan in 2005. The data
were calibrated according to the calibration report of Doose et al. (2001), which involved
correcting the dark current estimation carried out on-board the probe, correcting for detector
sensitivity and dividing by the exposure time of the images.

Further processing was carried out over the entire image set including mean-frame sub-
traction, diﬀerence imaging and image co-adding to enhance any potential atmospheric fea-
tures in the image. The images were blurred using a Gaussian ﬁlter to remove compression
artifacts.

Out of the 82 images retrieved from the archive and taken with the Side Looking Imager,
6 contained an extended horizontal feature. This feature is only detectable in mean-frame
subtracted or diﬀerence imaged frames. The intensity of the feature was measured in three
6 × 6 pixel regions and, for the majority of regions, the diﬀerence between the radiance of
the feature compared with the predicted radiance from background regions was outside the
95% conﬁdence limit. The change in optical depths caused by the feature were in the range
0.005 to 0.014.

The presence of a fog bank rising and falling explains the change in feature intensity
with respect to the background, the clustering of detections and the linear appearance of the
feature in the mean-frame subtracted images. A fog bank also explains the diﬀerence between
the predicted sky radiance in the non-mean frame subtracted images: the observed radiance
of the sky decreases more than the predicted radiance. Therefore, for the aforementioned
reasons the presence of a fog bank that rises and falls over the course of the observing period
is considered the most likely explanation for the observed feature.
