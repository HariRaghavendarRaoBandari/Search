Abstract: Higgs portal dark matter (DM) models are simple interesting and viable DM
models. There are three types of the models depending on the DM spin: scalar, fermion and
vector DM models. In this paper, we consider renormalizable, unitary and gauge invariant
Higgs portal DM models, and study how large parameter regions can be surveyed at the
International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment at
s = 500 GeV. For the Higgs portal
singlet fermion and vector DM cases, the force mediator involves two scalar propagators, the
SM-like Higgs boson and the dark Higgs boson. We show that their interference generates
interesting and important patterns in the mono-Z plus missing ET signatures at the ILC, and
the results are completely diﬀerent from those obtained from the Higgs portal DM models
within the eﬀective ﬁeld theories. In addition, we show that it would be possible to distinguish
the spin of DM in the Higgs portal scenarios, if the shape of the recoil-mass distribution is
observed. We emphasize that the interplay between these collider observations and those in
the direct detection experiments has to be performed in the model with renomalizability and
unitarity to combine the model analyses in diﬀerent scales.

One of the most pressing question after the Higgs boson discovery is to understand particle
physics nature of nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) of the universe. Existence of DM has been
conﬁrmed only through gravitation probes, and it is important to ﬁnd their properties (mass,
spin, quantum numbers, etc.) using terrestrial experimental apparatus. Among many DM
models, Higgs portal scalar, fermion and vector DM models are simple and interesting [1–8],
which are also phenomenologically viable and have intimate connections to the observed 125
GeV Higgs boson [9–11]. Study on the characteristic signatures at collider experiments has
to be performed to verify these models. In particular it would be important to know if one
can distinguish the DM spin at current or future colliders.

In this work, we present a detailed study on this issue at the International Linear Collider
(ILC) [12–14] in a careful manner using the Higgs portal DM models that are renormalizable,
gauge invariant and unitary [15–18]. For high-energy collider studies, using an eﬀective ﬁeld
theory (EFT) could be dangerous, especially when we do not know the mass scales of new
degrees of freedom. This is especially true for the dark matter physics, since nothing is known
about the DM mass, their interactions among themselves and with the SM particles, as well
as the masses of dark force mediators such as a dark photon or the dark Higgs boson.

The Lagrangian for the scalar DM (1.1) is renormalizable and unitary, and one can study
scalar DM phenomenology without any limitation.1 On the other hand, the Lagrangians
for the singlet fermion DM (1.2) contains a dim-5 operator Higgs portal interaction, and
eventually one has to consider its UV completions. The simplest UV completion for the
singlet fermion DM model with Higgs portal have been constructed in Refs. [15, 16] by
introducing a real singlet scalar mediator that couples to the singlet fermion DM and also to
the SM Higgs ﬁelds in an SU (2) singlet combination, H†H. Both DM phenomenology and
vacuum structures of the model have been studied in great detail. After electroweak symmetry
breaking, the singlet scalar mixes with the SM Higgs boson, which plays an important role
in DM direct detections as well as DM searches at colliders.

Likewise, the Higgs portal vector DM (VDM) model is problematic, because it does not
respect either unitarity or gauge invariance since the VDM mass is given by hand. Such
drawbacks could be overcome in UV-complete VDM models [17, 18, 24, 25], where VDM
becomes a dark gauge boson associated with a local U (1)X dark gauge symmetry. VDM
gets massive through a dark Higgs mechanism, and there would be a mixing between the SM
Higgs boson and the dark Higgs boson. Then VDM becomes stable by ad hoc Z2 symmetry
plus charge conjugation symmetry under U (1)X . One can also construct models where VDM
becomes absolutely stable due to the unbroken dark gauge symmetry, which has much richer
structure in the dark sector, namely dark monopole, massless dark photon and dark Higgs
boson as well as VDM [26].

These models have a new degree of freedom, a singlet-like scalar boson, which mixes with
the SM Higgs boson. Therefore at least two more parameters appear: the mass of the 2nd
scalar boson mH2 and the mixing angle α, as well as the coupling between the singlet scalar
and DM. One of the authors utilizes the 2nd scalar in order to explain the galactic center γ-
ray excess [22, 27–29] and to obtain a larger tensor-to-scalar ratio in the Higgs portal assisted
Higgs inﬂation scenario [30]. Also it was shown that the correlation between the upper bound
on the invisible Higgs decay branching ratio and the upper bound on the direct detection cross
section is modiﬁed in the renormalizable, unitary and gauge invariant models [31]. Global
analysis of the SM Higgs signal strengths should include its possible mixing with a singlet
scalar in this kind of DM models [32–34]

1There is an issue about Planck-scale suppressed Z2 breaking operator which would make EW scale scalar
DM decay fast. We refer to Ref. [22] for implementing global Z2 to Z2 subgroup of U (1) dark gauge symmetry
which resolves this problem. See also Ref. [23] for comparison of global vs. local Z3 scalar DM models.

The shortcomings of these eﬀective Lagrangians for singlet fermion and vector DM cases
have been pointed out within the DM phenomenology [15, 16]. Especially the direct-detection
cross-section (DM-nucleon scattering cross-section) depends on the model Lagrangians, namely
there is a generic destructive interference between the SM Higgs boson and the second singlet-
like scalar boson.

One important question in the Higgs portal DM models is how to distinguish three
diﬀerent cases at colliders and/or other experiments. In this paper, we study this issue at
the ILC, postponing the same issue at the LHC for future publication [35]. At the ILC, we
can ﬁx the initial beam energy and measure the 4-momenta of the ﬁnal Z0 in the process
e+e− → Z0 + (cid:54)ET , and there are simple relations among EZ, MDD and (cid:54)ET :

Z − 2EZ

where MDD is the invariant mass squared of the DM pair (D = S, χ, V in the following
sections). Therefore one can reconstruct all the relevant kinematic variables related with
DD and (cid:54)ET at the ILC, which renders us to study the Higgs portal DM properties in
DM, M 2
clean ways.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we describe the Higgs portal DM models for
scalar, fermion and vector DM. We set up the renormalizable, unitary and gauge invariant
Lagrangians, which can be used at an arbitrarily high-energy scale relevant to colliders, and
often produce diﬀerent results from the Higgs portal DM models with eﬀective nonrenormal-
izable and gauge-variant interactions. We present the amplitudes for the process relevant at
the ILC:

e+(p1) + e−(p2) → h∗(q) + Z(pZ) → S(k1) + S(k2) + Z(pZ) ,

(1.4)

and the counter processes for the fermion and vector DM models. In particular there are two
scalar propagators contributing to this process for the fermion and vector DM cases, as ﬁrst
pointed out in Ref. [36]. Then in Sec. 3, we give qualitative discussions on how to distinguish
3 diﬀerent cases with the rate and shape analysis. In Sec. 4, we describe the detailed analysis
on the parameter constraints at the ILC at
s = 500 GeV, and compare our results with
those obtained from the Higgs portal DM models based on the eﬀective ﬁeld theories. Finally
we conclude our analysis in Sec. 5.

2 Model Lagrangians

In this section, we deﬁne the simpliﬁed models for Higgs portal DM, where DM can be either
a scalar, fermion or vector particle. It is important to start from model Lagrangians that are
unitary and renormalizable and invariant under full SM gauge symmetry.

– 3 –

At the ILC, the Higgs portal DM can be produced through the following processes [37–41]:

 Z0Hi=1,2,

νeνeHi=1,2,
e+e−Hi=1,2,

e+e− →

(Higgs-strahlung),
(W +W −fusion),
(Z0Z0fusion),

(2.1)

all of which are followed by the Hi=1,2DD couplings. Note that as we will see in the following,
H1 and H2 are the Higgs bosons portal to DM in the fermion and vector DM models. There
is no H2 and H1 = HSM in the scalar DM case. One can identify the 1st process by tagging
Z0 in the µ+µ− or q ¯q channels. The 2nd process is impossible to observe since there is no
detectable particle in the ﬁnal-state. The 3rd process has a unique event topology too, but the
s (cid:39) 3 TeV [38].
total cross-section is more than 10 times smaller than the 1st process up to
Therefore, the 1st process is the most promising process to observe at the ILC with the
current proposal [37, 39].

√

In the following, we consider the 1st process as the signal of the DM production in the
Higgs portal DM models. However, depending on the details of the models which satisfy the
gauge invariance, unitarity and renormalizability, as well as on the model parameter regions,
the collider signatures can be diﬀerent. Thus, we have to perform the careful study on these
detectability.

2.2 Model for singlet fermion DM with Higgs portal

In the case of the Higgs portal fermion DM model, we assume that DM is a singlet Dirac
fermion χ with some nontrivial dark charge so that it is distinguishable from right-handed
neutrinos. Otherwise one can write down the Dirac neutrino Yukawa terms and χ would
decay and cannot be a good cold DM candidate. The simplest UV-completion of the Higgs
portal fermion DM model can be constructed by introducing a SU(2)-singlet scalar which has
a vacuum expectation value and a Yukawa interaction to DM giving its mass:

LSFDM = χ(i /∂ − mχ − yχφ)χ +

Expanding both ﬁelds around their VEVs by H →(cid:0)0, (vH + h)/

and φ → vφ + φ, we
can derive the Lagrangian in terms of h and φ. After diagonalization of the mass matrix in

following the convention of Ref. [15]. We identify the observed 125 GeV scalar boson as
H1. The mixing between h and φ leads to a universal suppression factor of the Higgs signal
strengths at the LHC, independent of production and decay channels [15]. From the current
data on Higgs signal strengths and the upper bound on the Higgs invisible branching ratio,
one can derive an upper bound, sin α (cid:46) 0.53 [42–44]. This bound is still quite weak and
should be improved in the future experiments.

Deﬁning λχ = yχ sin α cos α, the scattering amplitude for the process,

2.3 Gauge invariant unitary model for vector DM with Higgs portal

There are a number of diﬀerent models for stable or long-lived vector DM Vµ with Higgs
portal. The simplest model would be a phenomenological model where a discrete Z2 symmetry
(Vµ → −Vµ) is imposed by hand [17, 18, 24]. In order to construct a renormalizable and
unitary model, it is important to assume a dark gauge symmetry U (1)X and dark Higgs Φ
whose VEV provides a nonzero mass to vector DM Vµ and produces a dark Higgs ϕ as a
remnant of the Higgs mechanism:

L = − 1

).

(2.20)

One can also consider more sophisticated models where the aforementioned ad hoc Z2
symmetry is implemented to some local dark gauge symmetries. There are basically two
diﬀerent categories in this class.

• VDM is stable due to unbroken gauge symmetry [26]: One of the present authors
constructed a hidden sector monopole model where the renowned ’t Hooft-Polyakov
monopole is put in the hidden sector, which is connected to the SM sector through the
Higgs portal interaction. There are two stable DM in this case: hidden monopole which
is stable due to topological reason, and vector DM which is stable due to unbroken
U (1)X subgroup. There is massless dark photon associated with unbroken U (1)X , and
it can generate strong self-interaction between dark matters, and would contribute to
the dark radiation at the level of ∼ 0.1 which is perfectly consistent with Planck data.
• VDM is stable at renormalizable level, but could decay and is long lived when we con-
sider higher dimensional operators [45]. This happens if the dark gauge group SU (2)X
is completely broken by SU (2)X doublet complex dark Higgs, for example. In this case
the dark gauge symmetry is completely broken, and the massive VDM is not stable due
to the presence of higher dimensional nonrenormalizable operators.

In this paper, we do not consider these sophisticated models, and will consider phe-

nomenological VDM models, which could be considered as a simpliﬁed VDM model:

Similarly to the fermion DM model, h and ϕ are expressed in terms of the mass eigenstates
H1 and H2 with mixing angle α. For the purpose of studying the collider signatures, it would
be enough to consider the following simpliﬁed VDM with Higgs portal as, ignoring the triple

The signal distribution arises at t = (2mD)2, thus by measuring the threshold of the signal
excess, the DM mass can be directly determined. In addition, the threshold slope of the signal
excess depends on the spin of DM; for scalar and vector DM models it behaves as ∝ βD, while
for the fermion DM model it behave as β3
D. This is also useful to distinguish the spin of DM
by a kinematical method [46].

The t distribution in the high-t region is sensitive to the unitarity of the models. If we
ignore the 2nd Higgs propagator and identify mH1 = mH (the discovered Higgs boson), we
would have

These results indicate the violation of unitarity at high-t or high-s region, and the models
become unreliable. Note that ignoring the propagator of the 2nd Higgs would be justiﬁed

well convergent at high-t.

Therefore, one would be able to determine the type of DM by observing the shape of the
signal distribution. Having enough number of bins and data, we can test by χ2-minimization
to determine whether the observed (cid:54)ET distribution follows that of scalar, fermion or vector

except mD. Therefore it would be straightforward to check if the observed (cid:54)ET distribution
can be ﬁtted by the SM Higgs propagator or not. For the SFDM or VDM models, the ﬁtting
would be more complicated, since in this case, there are 4 parameters: namely,

sin α, mH2, ΓH2, mD.

Note that we have to regard ΓH2 and sin α independently, since H2 → H1H1 can be newly
open, which calls a new parameter that could be traded with ΓH2. With these 4 parameters,
we can ﬁt the (cid:54)ET spectrum or the recoil-mass spectrum, Mrec =
t, and determine the
physical parameters in the SFDM or VDM models.

ΓH2 = 0.1 GeV is used for simplicity. The characteristic threshold behavior as well as the

s − mZ, on-shell H2 can be produced and
subsequently decay into a pair of the DM particle. In such cases, the recoil mass distribution
shows a sharp peak at Mrec = mH2, and no diﬀerence can be observed between the fermion
s − mZ, no sharp peak can be
observed, because on-shell H2 cannot be produced because of the limited collision energy or
because on-shell H2 cannot decay into a DM pair, so that the DM pair is produced through the
oﬀ-shell H1 and H2. The recoil-mass distributions then behave as smooth curves depending
on the DM model as well as the masses of DM and H2. Thus, by measuring the shape of the
distribution, one can determine the type of the DM and its mass, as well as the mass of the
second Higgs portal to the DM.

4 Parameter Constraints

In this section, we discuss searches for the Higgs portal DM models at the future lepton
colliders. Depending on the masses of DM and the second Higgs boson in the fermion and
vector DM models, the search strategy at colliders can be diﬀerent. In Fig. 2, we divide the
parameter space in the (mH2-mD) plane in terms of the plausible collider signature to search
for in each parameter region in the fermion and vector DM models. In the scalar DM model,
because of the absence of H2, the parameter region can be simply divided by mD < mH1/2 or
mD > mH1/2, namely whether the observed Higgs boson can decay into the DM pair or not.
In the following subsections, we discuss collider signals of DM production in each region of
the parameter space, then further discuss the method to distinguish models, and to determine
the model parameters.
4.1 mD ≤ mH1/2
In the case of mD ≤ mH1/2, a DM pair can be produced in the decay of H1. This can be seen
as an invisible decay of the Higgs boson. The limit on the branching ratio of the invisible
decay has been obtained as B(h → inv.) (cid:46) 0.25 at the LHC [47–50]. We see how the model

Dividing parameter space in the (mH2-mD) plane by the plausible collider signature in the

Here, tα = tan α. We evaluate the current limit by the LHC Run-I measurement, B(hSM →
inv.) ≤ 0.25 [48], and also the accessible limits at future experiments, B(hSM → inv.) ≤ 0.0065
at the ILC 500 GeV with 500 fb−1, and ≤ 0.0032 with 1600 fb−1 [13]. The limits are obtained
on λHS, yχtα and gV tα in the scalar, fermion and vector DM models, respectively. For the
fermion (vector) DM model, the constraint on the coupling yχ (gV ) becomes weak for small
sα. The upper bound on sα has been obtained by measuring the signal strength of Higgs-
gauge-gauge coupling κV at the LHC Run-I, which is equal to cα in our models. Current
limit is about κV (cid:38) 0.85 at the 68% C.L. [42–44], thus sα (cid:46) 0.53. For the reference, in the
cases of cα = 0.9, 0.95 and 0.99, tα are (cid:39) 0.48, 0.33 and 0.14, respectively.
In the top-left, top-right and bottom panels in Fig. 3, current and future limits on the
parameters in the scalar, fermion and vector DM models with mD ≤ mH1/2 are plotted as
a function of mD, respectively. In the scalar DM model, λHS is constrained to be (cid:38) 0.01
for mD (cid:46) mH1/2. At the future ILC measurements, λHS (cid:38) 0.001 will be explored. In the
fermion and vector DM models, the constraints on yχtα (gV tα) are (cid:38) 0.01 by current LHC
measurement, and will be (cid:38) 0.001 by future ILC measurements. By observing non-zero sα
in future measurements, limits on the Higgs-DM-DM coupling can be derived.
4.2 mD ≥ mH1/2
In the scalar DM model with mD ≥ mH1/2, a DM pair is produced through the oﬀ-shell H1.
The collider signal for this case can be an excess in events with a Z-boson plus missing energy
with a large recoil-mass, Mrec. ≥ 2mD. We consider muonic and hadronic decays of Z-boson
whose branching ratios are B[Z → µ+µ−] (cid:39) 3.4% and B[Z → jj] 70%, respectively [51]. The

dimuon channel has limited number of events, but is promised to be observed because of the
clear signal and ﬁne momentum-resolution. The signal in dijet channel has large number of
events because of the large branching ratio, but may be aﬀected by large reducible background
events and less momentum resolution for jet measurements.

In the fermion and vector DM models, another Higgs boson H2 has been introduced.
If H2 can be produced on-shell, and its decay branching ratio into a DM pair is sizable, we
expect the invisible decay of H2 as a signal of the DM production. This can be investigated by
searching for another peak in the recoil mass distribution in events with Z-boson plus missing
energy. On the other hand, even if H2 cannot be produced on-shell or H2 cannot decay into a
DM pair by kinematical reasons, a DM pair can be produced through the oﬀ-shell propagation
of H1 and H2. The collider signal for this case would be an excess in a relatively wide region in
the recoil-mass distribution for the events with Z-boson plus missing energy. As we discussed,
+ imH2ΓH2)−1|2.
the propagators of H1 and H2 are ∝ |(t − m2
Thus, for m2

that the mass, spin of DM as well as the mass of another Higgs boson can be explored by
studying the shape of the recoil-mass distribution.

study the feasibility of detecting this process at the ILC by a simple MC simulation using
MadGraph [52]. The signal of the process can be a reconstructed Z-boson plus missing energy;

the other hand, those in the muonic channel come from e+e− → µ+µ−ν(cid:96) ¯ν(cid:96) with (cid:96) = e, µ, τ .
The total cross sections for these background processes in the dimuon and dijet channels are

In the fermion and vector DM models, the production cross section depends on mH2 as
well. We consider mH2 = 500 GeV and mH2 = 200 GeV for example. In the large mH2 limit,
the diagram with H2 propagator decouples, and the collider phenomenology becomes the
same as that for the simple extension of the SM by adding only the fermion or vector DM.3

3Modifying the SM Higgs boson couplings by κV = κF = cos α is an important consequence of making the

Higgs portal DM models SM gauge invariant and unitary [32, 36].

4.2.2 Fermion and Vector DM models with mD ≤ mH2/2
In the case with mD ≤ mH2/2 in the fermion and vector DM models, if H2 is light enough to
be produced, the DM can be searched for as an invisible decay of H2, since the coupling of the
dark matter to the another Higgs boson is expected to be sizable in the Higgs portal scenario.
Here, we study the production of H2 in e+e− → ZH2 where Z decays into µ+µ− or jj, and H2
decays into DD. This signal can be a part of the inclusive H2 search in e+e− → ZX process
where H2 can be detected by a new peak in the recoil mass distribution at Mrec. (cid:39) mH2.

We also perform a simulation analysis to study to what extent the signal can be de-
s = 500 GeV. The total event rate is estimated by
tected at future lepton colliders with
σ(ZH2)B(H2 → DD) where σ(ZH2) is proportional to s2
α. We consider a scenario where
B(H2 → DD) is large. For simplicity, we take B(H2 → DD) = 1. Then, sα is determined
or constrained by the experimental measurement. To enhance the signal signiﬁcance in the

presence of background events, we apply the same kinematical cuts in Eqs. (4.4) but the cut
on Mrec. is replaced by

|Mrec − mH2| ≤ 10 [GeV],

(4.6)

because of the sharp peak in the signal events. In Table 4, we summarize the signal cross-
section, signal and background eﬃciencies by cuts, and the lower limits of sα to be observed
at 5σ C.L. by using dimuon or dijet decays of Z boson and by assuming L = 500 or 1600 fb−1.
We ﬁnd that sα (cid:39) 0.1-0.2 can be investigated for mH2 = 150-300 GeV under the assumption
of B[H2 → DD] = 1. In Fig. 7, the lower limits of sα to be observed are plotted as a function
of mH2.
We make some comments on this analysis. First, because we have assumed B[H2 →
DD] = 1, the signal sensitivity may be maximized. For smaller B[H2 → DD], the number
of signal events is decreased and the sensitivity on sα would be weakened. In addition, the
analysis does not depend on mD, except demanding mD ≤ mH2/2. In the actual models,
branching ratios of H2 should be predicted and calculated as a function of sα, mH2, mD
and Γ(H2 → H1H1). The last quantity can be replaced by model parameters in the Higgs
potential in the model. More concrete analysis may be required to determine the model
parameters in general situations. Second, there is no distinction between the fermion DM
model and vector DM model in this measurement, since the recoil mass distribution behaves
just a sharp peak. Events in the oﬀ-peak region may be useful to distinguish the models
based on kinematics, if enough number of events are collected.

4.3 Comparison with Higgs portal DM models within EFT

For mH2 (cid:29) √

As we have seen above, the collider signals of the Higgs portal DM models, which are UV-
completed to preserve the gauge invariance, renormalizability and unitarity, are more com-
plicated than the simple EFT-based models. The presence of the second Higgs boson which
is inevitable to make the models with fermion or vector DM suitable with our requirement
gives characteristic signals for the DM production as well as the new scalar itself.

s, the distribution cannot be distinguished from that of the EFT calcula-
tion. Thus, a long tail or a roll in the high-t region does not immediately imply the unitary
violation, but can be regarded as a characteristic signal of the fermion and vector DM models.
However, the high-energy behavior of the model is completely diﬀerent depending on whether
the model is renormalizable or not as well as unitary or not. Collider phenomenology also
depends on the details of the models, such as presences of new scalars, partners of DM, etc.,
and also constraints from the DM relic density, direct detections, etc. We emphasize that the
interplay between these observations has to be performed in the model with renomalizability
and unitarity to combine the model analyses in diﬀerent scales.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have performed the detailed study of Higgs portal scalar, fermion and vector
DM models at the ILC. We consider the renormalizable, unitary and gauge invariant models,
and compare the results with those obtained within the eﬀective ﬁeld theories for the Higgs
portal fermion and vector DM models. For the singlet fermion and vector DM cases, the force
mediator involves two scalar propagators, the SM-like Higgs boson and the dark Higgs boson.

mono-Z plus missing ET signatures at the ILC, and the results are completely diﬀerent from
those obtained within the EFT. Compared with the EFT, our models have at least two extra
parameters, the singlet-like scalar mass mH2 and the scalar mixing angle α. These parameters
are largely unknown yet, except that sin α (cid:46) 0.53 from the current LHC data. The mixing
angle α can be probed at an accuracy of O(1%) or better by precision measurement of the
Higgs boson couplings at the ILC. By observing the DM pair production and the eﬀects of the
second Higgs boson to it, model parameters can be further constrained. In addition, it would
be possible to distinguish the spin of DM in the Higgs portal scenarios, if the shape of the
recoil-mass distribution is observed. Otherwise it would be extremely diﬃcult to distinguish
them. We will address the same questions at the LHC in a separate publication [35].
