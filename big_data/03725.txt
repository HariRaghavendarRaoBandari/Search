Abstract—The IEEE 802.22 is a new cognitive radio standard
that is aimed at extending wireless outreach to rural areas.
Known as wireless regional area networks, and designed based on
the not-to-interfere spectrum sharing model, WRANs are chan-
nelized and centrally-controlled networks working on the under-
utilized UHF/VHF TV bands to establish communication with
remote users, so-called customer premises equipment (CPEs). De-
spite the importance of reliable and interference-free operation in
these frequencies, spectrum sensing fusion mechanisms suggested
in IEEE 802.22 are rudimentary and fail to satisfy the stringent
mandated sensing requirements. Other deep-rooted shortcomings
are performance non-uniformity over different signal-to-noise-
ratio regimes, unbalanced performance, instability and lack of
ﬂexibility. Inspired by these observations,
in this paper we
propose a distributed spectrum sensing technique for WRANs,
named multi-channel learning-based distributed sensing fusion
mechanism (MC-LDS). MC-LDS is demonstrated to be self-
trained, stable and to compensate for fault reports through its
inherent reward-penalty approach. Moreover, MC-LDS exhibits
a better uniform performance in all trafﬁc regimes,
is fair
(reduces the false-alarm/misdetection gap), adjustable (works
with several degrees of freedom) and bandwidth efﬁcient (opens
transmission opportunities for more CPEs). Simulation results
and comparisons unanimously corroborate that MC-LDS out-
performs IEEE 802.22 recommended algorithms, i.e., the AND,
OR and VOTING rules.

I. INTRODUCTION

After a decade of painstaking and enduring efforts, cognitive
radio (CR) is now mature enough to be exploited as the
solution to spectrum inefﬁciency. The spread and diversity
of investigations have been substantial in both academia and
standardization bodies. The consolidation of these efforts has
recently appeared in the form of a prominent standard, IEEE
802.22 for WRANs, which aims at diminishing the rural-urban
divide by extending the reach of technology as far as possible.
At this point, CR seems to be just a tiny step away from
commercialization and transformation into something beyond
a technological concept. For this very reason, researchers
in both academia and industry need to designate particular
attention to IEEE 802.22 standard by reﬁning its features and
capabilities, and introducing compatible, yet more efﬁcient,

methods and mechanisms. To incite curious minds, the said
needs have been explicitly stated in the form of open issues
in this standard. Among these, the distributed sensing fusion
mechanism (SFM) is fundamental.1

The standard proposals for the SFM are basically AND,
OR and VOTING logic rules. Given the signiﬁcance of the
spectrum sensing process for networks operating in VHF/UHF
bands, these combining rules are not satisfactorily reliable,
accurate and stable. In particular, they suffer from unbalanced
performance, where a low false-alarm rate comes at the cost of
an unbearably high misdetection rate (and vice versa), and ex-
hibit rigid performance, that is, they are incapable of adjusting
their performance to varying conditions. Moreover, due to the
lack of performance stabilizing feedback from sensing output
to input, operational instability is possible, manifesting itself
in the form of weak performance in low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regimes. Therefore, the need for an efﬁcient distributed
SFM that avoids the above shortcomings, complies with the
standard directives, and can be easily embedded in the system,
is entirely felt.

The SFM proposed in this paper is named multi-channel
learning-based distributed sensing (MC-LDS) for its depen-
dence on learning through observation fostered by a reward-
penalty rationality. For the latter feature, MC-LDS showcases
a stable and self-trained behavior as well as robustness in
detecting faulty sensing reports. The other salient character-
istics of MC-LDS are improved performance in all trafﬁc
regimes, fairness (reduced false-alarm/misdetection gap), ad-
justability (operability with several degrees of freedom) and
bandwidth efﬁciency (increased transmission opportunities for
more CPEs. Simulation results and comparisons prove that
MC-LDS surpasses the sensing schemes proposed in the IEEE
802.22 standard. Furthermore, for its generic architecture,
MC-LDS can be integrated to boost the sensing performance
of other promising technologies and standards such as White-
Fi (IEEE 802.11af WLANs), wireless personal area networks
and ZigBee (IEEE 802.15 family), cognitive WiMax (IEEE
802.16h) and the recent IEEE 1900.6b standard emerged to
support spectrum databases using sensing information.

Before detailing the proposed multi-channel learning-based
distributed sensing mechanism, Section II describes the salient
proposals on collaborative spectrum sensing, in general, and
those for IEEE 802.22 WRANs. The discussion is followed
by describing the spectrum sensing function (SSF) of IEEE

II. SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT IN IEEE 802.22

When the sensing outcome is purely reliant on local deci-
sions of individual sensors, cost is inexorably a concern. To
have an accurate sensing outcome, each sensor node needs to
be equipped with a wideband antenna and an ampliﬁer with a
wide dynamic range. On the baseband side, high resolution
analog-to-digital converters operating over wide frequency
bands and ultra-fast signal processing units (DSPs and FP-
GAs) are essential. Such elements are expensive and have
limitations. Performance-wise, local sensing is not reliable and
needs many samples, particularly, in the presence of deteriorat-
ing dynamic phenomena such as multipath fading, shadowing,
noise, and hidden primary users (PUs). To tackle these issues,
the broadcasting nature of wireless channels and the spatial
diversity can be exploited to distribute the heavy sensing task
among sensor nodes across the network. Compared to local
sensing, collaborative sensing results in less frequent false-
alarm events for a ﬁxed probability of misdetection (and vice
versa) and reduces the average detection time.

In this section, some of the most recent investigations on
cooperative spectrum sensing in generic settings as well as
for WRANs are discussed, followed by the most relevant
WRAN’s spectrum management and scheduling functionality
whose knowledge is essential for understanding the proposed
MC-LDS technique elaborated in Section III.

A. Literature Review

Spectrum aimed for the operation of WRANs [1] hugely
overlaps with UHF/VHF TV bands in the 54-862 MHz range

[2]. Though these bands have been exclusively conceded to
incumbent operators for interference-free operation, they are
often empty and under-utilized, in time and space. Yet, the
exclusive access right legally inhibits others to use them. With
the new insights about what has provoked such spectrum inef-
ﬁciency, now WRAN operators are authorized to transmit on
these bands as long as they do not cause harmful interference
to the incumbent service. Such paradigm relies on reliable and
accurate channel sensing prior to transmission. To enhance
reliability and accuracy, collaborative spectrum sensing has
been proposed and shown to alleviate the destructive effects of
the hidden/exposed-terminal problems and the channel fading
(see e.g. [3], [4] and references therein).

While collaborative spectrum sensing improves the sensing
accuracy, this comes at the cost of lower sensing efﬁciency
triggered by higher energy consumption and signalling over-
head [5]. Although, high energy consumption may not be an
issue in ordinary networks, low power consumption and net-
work livability are the main objectives when nodes are battery
powered (e.g. cognitive sensor networks). Stimulated by this
idea, [6] introduced a combined sleeping/censoring scheme to
reduce sensing energy consumption. When the cognitive radio
network (CRN) operates over multiple channels, an important
issue is to determine how to distribute a limited number of
sensors to sense those channels. Two recent studies addressing
this problem are [7] and [8] where the ﬁrst aims at improving
energy efﬁciency and the latter adopts a Bayesian decision
rule to maximize the system throughput. Readers are referred
to [9] for a comprehensive review on sensing for CRNs.

Collaborative sensing can be realized in a centralized or
distributed fashion [10]. From a different perspective, existing
cooperative sensing mechanisms are different in (i) the way
sensors are selected and synchronized (sensor selection prob-

lem), (ii) what local sensing information is relayed (sensor
relaying problem), and (iii) how these local results are fused
(sensor fusion problem). Three approaches have been iden-
tiﬁed for sensor relaying: hard-decision combining (HDC),
quantized soft combining, and soft-decision combining (SDC).
While HDC and SDC have no distinctive edge over each other,
quantized soft combining methods seek a trade-off between
the two. In fact, while the local sensing decisions in HDC are
binary (with 0/1 indicating the absence/presence of incumbent
transmission), in SDC, any test statistic may be outputted.
Next, we delve into these two classes in further detail.

1) Hard-Decision Combining: One of the shortcomings of
the HDC schemes is their pure reliance on “sensing outcomes”
whereas “sensing reliability” is as important. The signiﬁcance
of the latter lies beneath the reality that cognitive sensors oper-
ate in a wireless environment tangled with random phenomena
that erratically diminish the credibility of the sensing outcomes
[11]. The other shortcoming develops in collaborative schemes
that neglect the existence of correlated shadowing, which
lessens the diversity degree and dwindles the sensing per-
formance [12]. Recognizing that both secondary and primary
signal powers fall off with distance and that the frequency
can be reused far from PUs, a distributed sensing mechanism
was proposed in [13] to derive a map for the power spectral
density in frequency and space. This map can then be used by
cognitive nodes to decide whether opportunistic transmission
is safe or not, even though the primary transmission may be
present. Static approaches such as AND, OR, VOTING, and
linear quadratic combination [14] are among HDC methods.
2) Soft-Decision Combining: Among the SDC methods,
fusion rules that are based on log-likelihood ratio test were
proven to be optimal [15]–[17]. Problems of this kind are
mostly formulated as a classiﬁcation problem [18] and are
computationally complex, especially in situations where the
sensing decision is to be taken in real-time. Alternatively,
there are other simpler methods to combine the individual
sensing outcomes, including maximal ratio combining (MRC),
equal gain combining (EGC) [4], selection combining (SC)
and switch and stay combining (SSC). It was also proven that
HDC has a very close performance to SDC [19], [4].

3) Sensing Fusion in IEEE 802.22: Since the release of the
WRAN standard, limited efforts have been dedicated to one of
the most fundamental open issues pointed out in [1], namely,

sensing fusion. The WRAN SFMs proposed in [20] operate
based on the idea of exploiting the sensors’ conﬁdence metrics.
[21] presents a sensing clustering mechanism for in-band sens-
ing, discusses the issue of “how often to sense the channel?”
in WRANs and proposes a scheduling mechanism for such.
Despite its implementation complexity, the approach in [21]
alleviates some of the shortcomings associated with the “OR”
SFM. The core clustering idea in [22] is the same as [21],
except that the former puts emphasis on security aspects of
the mechanism by using attack-tolerant collaborative sensing.
The closest study to the current paper is [23] which proposes a
single-channel learning-based distributed sensing mechanism
for WRANs operating in single-cell and normal operational
mode. The present paper is a profound multi-channel extension
of [23] to WRANs operating in coexistence mode.

B. Channel Management

The collaborative SFM proposed in [1] requires CPEs (a.k.a.
cognitive nodes or secondary users) to ﬁrst sense their oper-
ating channels individually and, then, report the results to the
base station (BS) intermittently. The sensing tasks should be
carried out during synchronized quiet periods (QPs), whereby
all CPEs shall go silent to reduce false-alarm events. The
network-wide and periodic coordination of QPs is one of the
responsibilities of the BS. In this regard, different QP sched-
ules may be required depending on the number of operating
channels being used by CPEs within a cell. Also, QPs at dif-
ferent channels can be overlapping or non-overlapping. Once
the sensing outcome of each CPE on the status of its operating
channel is reported to its associated BS,2 it is the responsibility
of the BS to make the decision upon the status of the sensed
channels and to administer any respective action. To enhance
the reporting reliability, [1] devises different notiﬁcation and
reporting mechanisms including contention-based, CDMA-
based through urgent coexistent situation (UCS) window and
bulk measurement messaging (BLM), as well as reporting
through CPEs’ allocated upstream bursts.

The rest of this section delineates the relevant WRAN
functionality, whose knowledge is needed for understanding
the sensing mechanism proposed in this paper. Before further
progression, the following notation is introduced: subscripts

context is channel sensing.

porting and decision-making procedures, these two mecha-
nisms differ in the way the corresponding channel lists are
updated. Speciﬁcally, a channel in PCL, say CHb, that is
sensed idle during OBS is removed from this list and added
to the CCL. Then, CHb will be added to the BCL only if
it has remained incumbent-free for no less than 30 sec, with
inter-sensing intervals not exceeding 6 sec each. On the ﬂip
side, CHb remains in PCL as long as it is sensed busy by
OBS sensors. In the former case, and after added to the BCL,
CHb either remains still as long as the OBS ﬂag is not raised
(otherwise, it shall return to the PCL) or enters the OCL
upon the channel switching event. The channel transitions
between lists implemented according to the above rules are
compactly represented in the form of a transition diagram (Fig.
2). Finally, disallowed channel list (DCL) bears the indices of
channels that are precluded from use by incumbents, thus, can
be unconditionally used by WRAN. Table II illustrates a state
of the simulated WRAN shown in Fig. 1, where 12 coexisting
cells operate on 10 channels.

2) Channel List Updating: When operated in coexistence
mode (see Section II.C), neighbouring WRAN cells may share
similar channel pools. In such situation, changes in BCL and
CCL of WRANj may be triggered for two reasons: (i) a
change in the status of the channels sensed in WRANj, as
described earlier, and (ii) a change in the channel lists of
WRANj’s neighboring cells [1, 10.2.3]. This is due to the
restrictions imposed by [1] on the choices of the operating
and backup channels in neighboring cells. For instance, neigh-
boring cells are not initially allowed to use similar operating
and backup channels at the same time. Therefore, in case of
channel swapping in the lists of WRANj, neighboring cells
may have to update their PCL and CCL lists, accordingly. For
such updating, WRANj uses the following local priority sets
(LPS),

The operators \ and ∪ represent the set difference (a.k.a.

cells of WRANj except itself. Since the updating decisions

i, j, k represent the CPE index, WRAN cell index (in a
network with M cells) and the operating channel index (in a
network with B channels), respectively. Table I consolidates
the notations and acronyms used in this paper.

1) Channel Switching: Once the BS in WRANj cell
concludes that one of its operating channels, say CHb, is
busy, CHb and its two adjacent channels, CHb±1, shall be
vacated, removed from the operating channel list (OCL) and
added to the protected channel list (PCL), which is then
followed by the high priority channel switching mechanism
[1, 7.22]. Upon this change, the BS assigns a timer with
long enough duration to CPEi,j in WRANj to ascertain
CPEs are prepared for the aforementioned switching operation,
provided that such duration is no longer that the maximum
allowable channel moving time. Subsequently, a channel from
the backup channel list (BCL) of WRANj is selected and the
switching procedure gets initiated. This mechanism is called
in-band sensing (IBS) [1, 10.3.3] because the sensing is carried
out on the operating channels, as opposed to the out-of-band
sensing (OBS) [1, 10.3.1] on the protected, candidate and
backup channels [1, 10.2.3].

The importance of OBS is due to the vital need to al-
ways maintain a sufﬁcient number of channels in the OCL,
through a closed-loop mechanism (shown in Fig. 2) giving
fair opportunities to all channels to return to the OCL as the
incumbent transmission vanishes. Therefore, some CPEs are
to be speciﬁcally selected and assigned to perform OBS on
channels in BCL, PCL and the candidate channel list (CCL).
Since no payload is transmitted over these channels, they do
not need to be sensed during network-wide QPs, thus are less
burdensome.

Notwithstanding the similarity between OBS and IBS re-

C. Normal Mode vs. Coexistence Mode

The IEEE 802.22 standard allows two modes of operation,
namely, normal and coexistence. Unlike the normal mode of
operation in which only a single WRAN exists to transmit
in all the resource blocks (RBs) or multiple WRANs exist
but with totally isolated frequency bands, in the coexistence
mode [1, 7.20] one or more channels may be shared among
neighboring WRAN cells. It is to be noted that the coexistence
beacon protocol (CBP) is responsible to achieve synchroniza-
tion among operating cells by transmitting control packets
during self-coexistence windows (SCW). Readers are referred
to [24], [25] to know more about WRAN frame structure.

The interference-free requirements in IEEE 802.22 WRANs
not only necessitate that a channel discovered as busy and
its two adjacent channels get immediately vacated to avoid
inter-carrier interference, but also impose constraints on the
choice of the operating channels in neighboring WRAN cells
(in the coexistence mode). More narrowly, the CBP acts as
a coordinator by prohibiting neighboring cells from using
similar operating channel or by settling down a compromise.

D. Quiet Period Management

One of the prime challenges of IBS is its uncompromising
requirement to silent all CPEs for a span of time, i.e. QP. De-
spite their important role in accurate sensing, QPs can severely
degrade sensing efﬁciency and quality-of-service (QoS) since
no data payload is transmitted on the operating channels in
these interims. In the particular situation where inter-frame
sensing is obligated, which lasts for an entire superframe
duration, the QoS damage can sometimes be even more acute
[1, 7.21.1]. On the other hand, the OBS execution does not
require network-wide QP scheduling as the target channels
are not used for transmission, which ultimately burdens less
sensing cost.

To deal with its inherent shortcoming and meet channel
detection-time requirements [1, 7.21], IBS in WRAN is carried
out in two different scales: intra-frame IBS and inter-frame
IBS. This two-stage QP management enables the network to
adjust the sensing length and repetition rate, as per needs.
In fact, the sensing procedure always starts with the more
frequent, shorter (lasting for a frame length of ∼= 10ms) and
less complex intra-frame IBS, which may be followed by more
precise, but longer inter-frame IBS (lasting for upto a super-
frame length ∼= 160ms) utilizing more complicated algorithms,
in case the detection requirements are not met by intra-frame
IBS. When WRAN is operated in coexistence mode, both QP

types shall be synchronized between neighboring cells using
superframe control header (SCH) or channel request/response
messages.

III. THE PROPOSED MULTI-CHANNEL SENSING FUSION

MECHANISM

As pointed out earlier, the standard left the choice of a
ubiquitous SFM an open issue for most of the regulatory
domains [1, 8.6.3.1]. Seemingly, this is due to the uncertainties
that the relevant working groups bore about the performance
optimality, efﬁciency and practicality of the existing dis-
tributed sensing solutions in the literature as well as their
integrability within the standard’s framework. Therefore, [1]
proposed basic SFMs with deterministic performance, such
as AND, OR and VOTING rules, as an interim solution
until more ﬁtting mechanisms appear. Moreover, [1] does not
mandate the aforementioned SFMs for most of the regulatory
domains, except for the United States, which certainly is an
unduly cautious choice whose ramiﬁcation is the waste of
resources manifested by high false-alarm probability. All these
became our motivations to work out an efﬁcient, standard-
compatible, and easily implementable, multi-channel learning-
based distributed SFM: the proposed MC-LDS. Seeing what
is proposed in this paper as a truly generic fusion scheme, the
authors discern a broader range of applicability for MC-LDS
beyond WRANs.

Let us focus on Fig. 1, which depicts a network layout
consisting of M = 12 coexisting cells within which CPEs
are uniformly distributed. The incumbent base stations (IS)

are represented with solid dots whose coverage zones are
shown with overlapping dashed circles. A number of channels
conceded to the IS are opportunistically accessed by WRAN
cells. The proposed MC-LDS mechanism, reinforced from
underneath by a reward-penalty rationality as well as two
levels of differentiation, is detailed next.

A. Decision Binarization

As detailed in [1], sensors should individually sense the
channels within synchronized QPs. As explained earlier, in
combining the sensing outcomes, HDC methods are less
complex but less optimal compared to SDC methods. To have
the best out of both worlds, any future SFM proposal for
amendment to the standard is better to be a combination
of HDC and SDC. This is the basic idea behind MC-LDS.
Herein, energy detection is adopted for it is analytical tractabil-
ity and its prevalence. Sensing by energy detection requires
the least processing, which is basically done by taking M
discrete samples from the received signal y and forming the
power-sum S =PM
j=1 |y[j]|2. The major drawback of sensing
by energy detection is its vulnerability to noise uncertainties,
which can be tackled through cooperation.

Irrespective of the type, the performance of any spectrum
sensing mechanism is measured by four rates: (1) true-
positive, (2) true-negative, (3) false-positive (a.k.a. false-alarm
rate, PFA), and (4) false-negative (a.k.a. misdetection rate,
PMD). It is to be noted that the consolidation of (1) and (2) into
a single quantity is also recognized as successful discovering
probability, PSD. The false-alarm probability, PFA, quantiﬁes
the sensor’s misperception acuity in detecting a primary trans-
mission that does not actually exist. On the other hand, the
misdetection rate, PMD, denotes the sensor’s inability to detect
a primary transmission that does actually exist. Hereafter, the
superscript (t) over symbols denotes the QP index, which
may be signiﬁed by QP(t), as well. Adhering to this notation
system, and recalling that
indices i, j and k denote the
sensor, WRAN cell and operating channel, respectively, the
aforementioned quantities are mathematically expressed as:

P (t),k

The MC-LDS distributed SFM works with local binary
sensing decisions (denoted d(t)
i,j,k is the solution
of a binary classiﬁcation problem that
the sensor has to
repeatedly solve after QP(t). Though this puts MC-LDS
somewhere inside the HDC class, here local decisions d(t)
i,j,k
are not made statically using an unreﬁned strategy such as

i,j,k). Each d(t)

i,j,k ≥ λj,k) → d(t)

i,j,k = 1 (or Pr(S(t)

Pr(S(t)
i,j,k < λj,k) →
d(t)
i,j,k = 0), but rather adaptively.
To solve the local classiﬁcation problem, the logistic regres-
sion method is adopted. This is because logistic regression’s
outcome is the best ﬁtting predictor among other classiﬁcation
supervised learning methods,3 that not only forecasts the
operating channel status for future moments, but its value
is a meaningful continuum which can be interpreted as the
probability that the operating channel is busy. Also, it is a
well-accepted fact that logistic estimator is consistent (chooses
the right estimator in the limit when the number of training
examples is large) and efﬁcient (no other estimator converges
faster, in the mean squared sense). These traits make logis-
tic regression the appropriate classiﬁcation tool in problems
where there is uncontrollable stochasticity in the system.
Dubbed logistic (Sigmoid) function, 0 ≤ σ (S) < 1 is deﬁned
as the probability that the measured channel is busy and is
characterized by,

i,j,k is the tth measured power in Ni, and L(·) is the
likelihood function to be evaluated at all training samples

the likelihood function L(·) is in the form of a Bernoulli
distribution:

Quite obvious from (4), d = 1(or 0) → L(S) =

a unique optimal ˆΘi exists, which can be found efﬁciently in
polynomial time. Once obtained, this optimal ˆΘi is plugged
into (2) giving the corresponding channel busyness probabil-

(HDC) in the decision combination step. We adopt the latter
approach in subsection III.B. To that end, and since the

i,j,k = x(cid:17). Such

i,j,k = 1(cid:12)(cid:12)S(t)

predictor σ(cid:16)S(t)
i,j,k = x(cid:17) is a continuous function in [0, 1],
∀x ∈ [−∞,∞], as depicted in Fig. 4b, the following dis-

i,j,k = 1Ai(cid:16)S(t)

i,j,k = x(cid:17) =(cid:26) 1 if x ∈ Ai

To duly characterize (5), sub-interval Ai
is to be iden-
tiﬁed. In the case of logistic regression,
this task is not
so difﬁcult as the predictor function σ (S) is monotonically
is a convex lower-bounded in-
increasing and, hence, Ai

the curve), if one could manage to know the probability

i,j,k > λj,k(cid:17), then the corresponding power obtainable
Pr(cid:16)S(t)

would be the aforementioned Ai’s lower bound. Mathemat-

Before tackling the decision combining problem, it should
be noted that the MLE in (3) does not have to be solved
at every QP. Instead, it may be worked out once enough time
is elapsed since the last estimation, or upon the availability of
new strong evidences substantiating that the predictor’s error
is unacceptable.

B. Decision Combination

The aptness of the MC-LDS SFM hinges on two inter-
nalized levels of differentiation: temporal and spatial. Before
describing the temporal differentiation, we need to introduce
the reward-penalty logic used by MC-LDS. The logic here is
to use the following rules to afﬁx different scores (positive or
negative) to sensors depending on situations that may come up:
at QP(t), given the set {d(t)
i=0 of the most recent sensing
measurements from mj,k + 1 sensors participating in sensing
CHk in WRANj,5 the latest central sensing decision D(t−1)
,
and given the channel status estimate R(t)
j,k obtainable from the
database service, the BS assigns the following rewards-penalty
scores L(t)
i,j,k to mj,k +1 participating sensors, ∀j ∈ M, k ∈ B,
and provided that 0 < γk < ζk:

sensing precision and reliability as repeatedly emphasized and
mandated in the standard [1, 10.2.2]. Accordingly, WRAN BSs
should retrieve the available channel list as well as the max-
imum allowed EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) by
sending queries to an incumbent database. Operated by third
parties (c.f. FCC R&O 08-260 [27]), the service provided by
such database is only a crude estimate of whether the queried
channel is occupied at a given location-time or not. Concretely,
factors such as passiveness of primary receivers (causing
hidden terminal effect), non-real time database availability,
and the unpredictable and varying nature of communication
channel, make mere reliance on database service futile. Fig.
5 is a spatial snapshot from a database wherein disks with
different colors denote the keepout footprint of three channels

LDS is temporal. The key idea is to allow both most recent
and historical sensing results of Seni,j to participate in the
decision-making process. However, to account for the fact that
recent measurements are more dependable compared to older
ones,6 the temporal discount tensor [αj,k] is introduced, which
may be chosen adaptively or statically. Therefore, by merging
the reward-penalty scores, the conﬁdence metric, w(n)
i,j,k,7 is
derived for Seni,j at the present sensing interval, meaning
QP(t=n), according to

w(n)

where the superscript n−t is the mathematical exponentiation,
as opposed to the indexing superscript (t). The historic count
tensor [Nj,k] represents the effective temporal
length. As
discussed in the next section, we implement static selection as
well as dynamic adjustment when [Nj,k] and [αj,k] adaptively
vary. An implication of (10) is that Seni,j that unceasingly
inputs wrong information to its BS possesses a smaller (more
negative) conﬁdence metric than one with a more truthful
record.

In the next step, a discrete-to-continuous channel indicator
i,j,k is derived for Seni,j at the present sensing interval
i,j,k and its sensing result d(n)

Since transmissions can take place on more than one
operating channel, a cell can possess multiple values for R(t)
j,k
and D(t−1)
the designation
of the reward-penalty scores gives the highest reward (ζk)
to Seni,j whose decision accords with the database reading
(d(t)
j,k) but differs with the latest central decision
(D(t−1)
j,k). On the other hand, the highest penalty (−ζk)
is imposed to a sensor when the database reading neither
agrees with the the latest central nor with that sensor’s local
decision. Table III is a representation of (8) which, equiva-
lently, reduces to the following mathematical expression:

So far, the mechanism has dealt with the sensing outputs
from sensors in solidarity. To make an intelligent decision
and improve the reliability,
these local sensing outcomes
are to be combined. In the context of WRANs, after the

When combining outcomes, there is another source of error,
which may degrade the sensing performance. More narrowly,
while the sensing reliability of Seni,j is an important factor,
the quality of the CPE-to-BS link, known as reporting channel,
should also be taken into account. Thereby, in combining the
local sensing outcomes, the second level of differentiation,
known as spatial, is sustained by dedicating larger trust on

recurring transmission pattern of PUs are two underpinning reasons to sustain
temporal differentiation.

process, compared to a less reliable sensor (smaller X (n)

There is another important

the way
(11) is deﬁned in conjunction with (12). More precisely, a

ing a busy channel in (12), is attained when one of these

two cases occurs in (11): (i) hw(n)
hw(n)

i,j,k = 1i and (ii)
i,j,k = 0i. While (i) implies that a trustworthy

sensor, which perceives the channel as busy in QP(t=n) (i.e.
current sensing interval), chips in directly in declaring a
busy channel in (12), the direct implication from (ii) is that
an unreliable sensor, which incorrectly discerns the channel
status as idle, was forced to make a reverse inﬂuence. In
other words, with MC-LDS, both unreliable and reliable
sensors are identiﬁed based on their historical records and
are constructively leveraged towards a more accurate ﬁnal
decision. Similar deductions are valid for negative X (n)

resulting from two other cases: (iii) hw(n)
and (iv) hw(n)

i,j,k = 0i.

The other important attribute of MC-LDS is the relativity

IV. SIMULATION AND VALIDATION RESULTS

A. Simulator Platform

To verify the performance of MC-LDS, a discrete-even sim-
ulator was built in C++ and Maple programming languages.
In the simulator, all the relevant management and controlling
functions of WRAN were implemented. This chieﬂy includes
the QP and sensing management procedures (including inter-
frame and intra-frame sensing, synchronization and report-
ing), channel management functions (including channel list
updating, channel switching scheduling, etc.), and incumbent
protection module. Coexistence among WRAN cells was taken
into accout through the implementation of the CBP protocol.
The topology in each cell is realized in 2D space, meaning
that CPEs are assumed to be at
the same height, which
is close to reality for rural areas where WRAN antennas
are normally mounted few meters above the ground level at
almost the same elevation. All the communication settings,
including transmit power, WRAN cell’s diameter, SNR thresh-
old, incumbent activity pattern, channel width, interference
temperature, maximum allowed interference time, etc. were
chosen based on recommendations and mandates of [1] (in
particular Annex A) and, if not alluded, typical values were
chosen. The channel degrading factors, noise and fading, were
implemented for both the sensing and the reporting channels.
In addition, correlated channel fading [28] was taken into
account, by restricting CPEs that happen to be in λ/4 vicinity
to experience similar channel gains from the BS. User mobility
was not considered in the simulator since WRANs are aimed
for static household rather than mobile users. This is apart
from the fact that larger antenna size in UHF/VHF frequencies
poses serious practical considerations for mobile applications.

10

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING, ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION, JANUARY 2016.

For the fact that CPEs are immobile, population density is
low, and reﬂectors, refractors and scatterers are proportionately
motionless, slow fading is a reasonable model for temporal
variations of the wireless channel in rural areas. The latter
was implemented by afﬁxing similar channel gains over sev-
eral consecutive time frames. Further, the incumbent activity
pattern is assumed to be independent across multiple available
channels, where the activity ratio (i.e. IAR=ON/OFF) on each
channel is a mix of bursty and non-bursty patterns with the
possibility to adjust the IAR.

At the simulation start-up, a number of channels are ran-
domly distributed among ISs, where two or more different ISs
may broadcast the same channel to their respective users. In
the latter case, the footage of two or more ISs may overlap
to have the whole geographical area under coverage of the
incumbent service. This may lead to a CPE accidentally
located within the transmission range of two or more active ISs
to collect a primary signal with a large superimposed power
from all sources, an incidence that can inﬂuence the false-
alarm and misdetection rates, signiﬁcantly, but neglected in
almost all models. This effect was also properly realized in
the simulator.

B. Performance Measures

To evaluate the performance of MC-LDS, several perfor-

mance measures are introduced in this paper.

1) False Alarm Rate: Theoretically deﬁned as in (2), the
false-alarm rate can be experimentally estimated, for an indi-
vidual sensor as well as for the entire cell, using the following

sensing results. To have more smooth measures, the latest νk
samples derived from CHk are averaged in (13).

By probing (13)-(15) in every sensing interval, the WRAN
BS remains vigilant as to whether certain thresholds are
exceeded or not,8 whereupon appropriate actions such as
channel switching, cell shutdown, etc., may be taken.

4) Correlation Point Indicator: The false-alarm and misde-
tection rates are intrinsically conﬂicting measures, where an
increase of one inevitably results in a decrease of the other.
Thus, when comparing different SFMs using these measures,
no conclusive decision can be made about the superiority or
the inferiority of one versus the other. This fact (also known
as bias-variance trade-off in machine learning and accuracy-
efﬁciency trade-off in decision theory) was illustrated in Fig.
4a, where the conﬁned areas underneath the Gaussian PDF
for null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses signify the
paradoxical fact that how the optimal choice of the threshold
SNR, of which we have no knowledge, matters in having the
right balance between utilization of the spectrum and radiated
interference.

Consequently, the need for a single performance measure
that jointly and fairly encompasses PFA and PMD is felt. The
correlation matrix C = [NWCF(n)
j,k ]M×B serves this purpose
where NWCF(n)
j,k quantiﬁes the amount of statistical similarity
between two data streams, namely the factual ({Z (t)
)
t=n−νk
status of CHk and its estimation by WRANj ({D(t)
),
over the most recent νk QPs. To have an scalar indicator,
we deﬁne a metric called network-wide correlation factor
(NWCF) by weighted averaging of the correlation matrix over
its rows and columns.

5) Goodness of Fit: The next statistical test used to check
the accuracy of MC-LDS is the Pearson chi-square test for
the goodness-of-ﬁt. As one of the most popular and prevalent
statistical tests [29], Pearson test is used to verify whether an
obtained histogram (or an estimated categorical data) matches

j,ki2
a theoretical PDF (or factual data). Represented by hχ(n)

and called Pearson’s cumulative test statistic, a real number
is obtained per cell, operating channel, and sensing interval,
which can either be used directly to quantify the similarity
level according to,

existing cells and B channels, a single performance vector
[NWCF, PSD,T, PMD,T, PFA,T, χ2] of ﬁve elements is ob-
tained per cell, per channel. Thus, a M × B matrix of above
vectors is obtained to evaluate the performance of MC-LDS.
An example of this matrix for the misdetection rate is extracted
from the simulator and reproduced in Table IV.

C. Comparative Results

Numerous experiments were conducted to verify the perfor-
mance of MC-LDS. Comparative results were plotted versus
SNR at transmitter side, often known as transmit SNR (dB).
For the sake of comprehensiveness, different circumstances
were examined, including diverse SNR regimes, fading situ-
ations, incumbent activity pattern proﬁles, etc. Furthermore,
the performance of MC-LDS was probed in the presence of
hidden and exposed terminals. The observations unanimously
prove that MC-LDS is superior to AND, OR and VOTING
SFMs. Of particular importance is the performance uniformity
of MC-LDS in different SNR regimes.

Fig. 7 proves the above claim for a wide SNR range (−70 to
110 dB). Starting from low SNR regimes, wherein, principally,
the real merits or weaknesses of any decision combining
method lie, the MC-LDS SFM is unequivocally superior to
all its rivals for all the metrics. At high SNRs, MC-LDS
still keeps the superiority in comparison to VOTING and
AND rules, even though, correlation-wise, the OR-rule has the
edge over MC-LDS. Notwithstanding, this slight superiority is
severely compromised by the unacceptably high false-alarm
rate that OR-rule exhibits at all the times. This is further to
the fact that when IAR << 1 and the incumbent network’s
alteration frequency (IAF) is high,9 the OR-rule exhibits
extremely poor performance in all the metrics while MC-LDS
still keeps the edge over the others. Overall, despite the fact
that achieving low false-alarm and misdetection rates at the
same time is theoretically impossible, as discussed earlier,
the MC-LDS mechanism still ﬁnds the best trade-off that
maximizes the NWCF and minimizes the Pearson’s goodness-
of-ﬁt metric.

One should note that the superior behavior of the OR-rule
in terms of misdetection rate does not make it an optimal
decision combining approach due to the very high false-
alarm rate it manifests, as shown in Fig. 7c, 7d. The same
is true about the AND-rule which yields low false-alarm
rate at the expense of unacceptably high misdetection rate.
More troublesome is the unstable behavior of these two SFMs
when IAR or IAF vary, exhibiting very different performance
proﬁles. Yet, one should keep in mind that the joint inclusion
of OR/AND in comparisons is always a good benchmark as
it reveals the ﬂaws and strengths of any decision combining
mechanism, including MC-LDS, a fact that was proven in
[18] and exploited in many papers, e.g. [30]. For the sake
of conﬁdence, the comparisons were also made against the
VOTING-rule, which was shown in [31, P.63], [32, Ch.5] and
[16] to secure sub-optimal outcomes in many situations.

9The incumbent alteration frequency is the frequency with which ON and
OFF periods alternate, whereas the incumbent activity rate indicates how
relatively large ON periods are w.r.t. OFF periods.

tor is not satisfactory, for instance when there is no reasonable
balance between PMD,T and PFA,T , the dynamic adjustment
of α and N can make drastic changes. One approach is to
associate these parameters with the estimated false-alarm and
misdetection rates in a linear fashion, such that

a, b, c, d ∈ R+ are chosen statically. Red dotted curves with
star marks in Fig. 7c and 7d illustrate the obtainable gain, in
terms of PFA,T and PMD,T, by simply feeding the output of
the system back to its input, and substantiate the importance
of feedback in stabilizing cognitive systems and improving
their performance.

V. CONCLUSION

This work proposed an efﬁcient decision combining
method, named multi-channel learning-based distributed sens-
ing (MC-LDS) mechanism, for wireless regional area net-
works (WRANs). While conforming with the IEEE 802.22
standard directives, MC-LDS operates based on a simple
learning concept that uses differentiation as well as reward-
penalty procedures to intelligently combine current and past
sensing measurements. The combination was done in such a
way that both accurate and faulty sensors contribute construc-
tively toward an accurate ﬁnal decision. To substantiate the
merits of MC-LDS, a WRAN simulator was built. Through
precise probing of a comprehensive set of quantities such as
false-alarm, misdetection and successful discovery rates, as
well as correlation factor and goodness-of-ﬁt metric, it was
demonstrated that MC-LDS is considerably superior to AND,
OR and VOTING rules. Among the advantages of MC-LDS,
its accuracy, implementation ease, fairness, adjustability and
stability are to be emphasized. Having shown the intrinsic
inefﬁciencies and drawback of the SFMs suggested by the
IEEE 802.22 standard, we present MC-LDS as a competent
candidate for adoption in WRANs. Furthermore, MC-LDS
can be integrated to boost the sensing performance in other
promising technologies and standards such as White-Fi (IEEE

802.11af WLANs) wireless personal area networks and Zig-
Bee (IEEE 802.15 family), cognitive WiMax (IEEE 802.16h)
and the recent IEEE 1900.6b standard emerged to support
spectrum databases using spectrum sensing information.
