ABSTRACT

SN 2012dn is a super-Chandrasekhar mass candidate in a purportedly normal
spiral (SAcd) galaxy, and poses a challenge for theories of type Ia supernova diversity.
Here we utilize the fast and highly parameterized spectrum synthesis tool, SYNAPPS,
to estimate relative expansion velocities of species inferred from optical spectra ob-
tained with six facilities. As with previous studies of normal SN Ia, we ﬁnd that both
unburned carbon and intermediate mass elements are spatially coincident within the
ejecta near and below 14,000 km s−1. Although the upper limit on SN 2012dn’s peak
luminosity is comparable to some of the most luminous normal SN Ia, we ﬁnd a pro-
genitor mass exceeding ∼ 1.6 M(cid:12) is not strongly favored by leading merger models
since these models do not accurately predict spectroscopic observations of SN 2012dn
and more normal events. In addition, a comparison of light curves and host-galaxy
masses for a sample of literature and Palomar Transient Factory SN Ia reveals a di-
verse distribution of SN Ia subtypes where carbon-rich material remains unburned
in some instances. Such events include SN 1991T, 1997br, and 1999aa where trace
signatures of C III at optical wavelengths are presumably detected.

1 INTRODUCTION

The progenitor systems of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) have
not been observed, although it is widely believed that some
SN Ia are the product of a thermonuclear runaway in a white
dwarf star (WD) with a mass near the Chandrasekhar limit,
MCh ≈ 1.38 M(cid:12) (Nugent et al. 2011 and references therein).
There is also observational evidence to suggest that the pro-
genitor mass for a fraction of over-luminous events may ex-
ceed MCh (Howell et al. 2006; Jeﬀery et al. 2006; Yamanaka
et al. 2009; Scalzo et al. 2010), while the progenitor mass
for some fraction of normal and sub-luminous SN Ia may
be notably less than MCh (Woosley & Kasen 2011; Shen &
Moore 2014; Scalzo et al. 2014c; Dan et al. 2015).

Studies of SN Ia therefore face an interesting challenge
as these exploded WD systems may be the merger of two
sub-MCh WDs (Kromer et al. 2013), some involving low-
mass helium stars (Shen & Moore 2014; Dan et al. 2015);
coalesced mergers or prompt “peri-mergers” of two near-
MCh WDs (Moll et al. 2014; Raskin et al. 2014); massive
WDs in single-degenerate systems (Hachisu et al. 2012; Chen
et al. 2014); and single-degenerate systems with sub-MCh
ejecta masses (Chiosi et al. 2015). Spectroscopic modeling
has also yet to distinguish appearances between single and
double-degenerate scenarios (Liu et al. 1997; Kasen & Plewa
2007; R¨opke et al. 2012; Mazzali et al. 2015; Dessart et al.
2014). The uniqueness of progenitor systems that produce
super-MCh mass candidates (SCC) and more common SN Ia
thus remains an open issue.

Early-phase optical spectra of the SCC class are thus
far characterized by relatively weak and narrow spec-
tral features, moderate to low mean expansion velocities
(8 − 16 x 103 km s−1), lower than normal line-velocity gra-
dients of blended absorption minima, and higher than nor-
mal integrated ﬂux near maximum light (Scalzo et al. 2012;
Brown et al. 2014). This in combination with relatively large
and long-lasting signatures of C II λλ 6580, 7234 suggest the
presence of higher than normal amounts of unburned carbon
(Howell et al. 2006; Scalzo et al. 2010; Taubenberger et al.
2013). Although there are few well-observed SCC SN Ia,
e.g., the over-luminous SN 2009dc (Yamanaka et al. 2009;
Tanaka et al. 2010; Silverman et al. 2011), the most recent,
SN 2012dn, reached a peak absolute magnitude that was
not exceptionally luminous (Brown et al. 2014; Chakradhari
et al. 2014), and the same can be said for the spectroscopi-
cally similar SN 2006gz (Maeda et al. 2009).

For some SCC SN Ia, signatures of C II may not be
conspicuous above low signal-to-noise ratios, or the signa-
ture may be fast-evolving similar to that seen for the nor-
mal, SN 1999aa-like hybrid, SN 2013dy (see also SN 1999ac;
Garavini et al. 2005). Signatures of carbon might also be
detected as C III λ4649 in so-called “Shallow Silicon” SN Ia
that display spectral signatures of overall higher ionization
species, e.g., SN 1991T and 1997br (Hatano et al. 2002; Gar-
avini et al. 2004; Parrent et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2013;
Scalzo et al. 2014b). Seemingly smaller amounts of unburned
material of the C+O progenitor, or burned material of the
He+C+O progenitor, are frequently detected for so-called
“Core Normal” SN Ia (Jeﬀery et al. 1992; Fisher et al. 1997;
Branch et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2007), while signatures of
C I λ10691 are detected for several events, and possibly all

SN Ia (H¨oﬂich et al. 2002; Marion et al. 2015; Hsiao et al.
2015).

explosion mechanisms

Signatures of carbon in the outermost ejecta may be a
general characteristic of Pulsational-Delayed Detonation(-
like)
(PDD), as proposed for
SN 2011fe and 2013dy-like events (Khokhlov 1991; Bravo
et al. 2009; Dessart et al. 2014), in addition to peculiar
SN 2002cx-like events (Baron 2014). Carbon-rich regions
may also be associated with the remains of a degenerate sec-
ondary star that is distributed amorphously at the time of
the explosion, where signatures of C II may not be physically
associated with C I deeper within the ejecta of the primary
WD (cf. Taubenberger et al. 2011, 2013; Moll et al. 2014;
Raskin et al. 2014). Adding to this complexity is whether
normal SN Ia originate from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass pri-
mary WD (Woosley & Weaver 1994; Liu et al. 1998; van
Kerkwijk et al. 2010; Pakmor et al. 2012; Raskin & Kasen
2013; Scalzo et al. 2014c; Chiosi et al. 2015).

From comparisons of synthesized photometry and spec-
tra, Pakmor et al. (2012) found moderate agreement be-
tween the normal SN Ia 2003du and their violent merger
model totaling 2.0 M(cid:12) (see also Moll et al. 2014). Raskin
et al. (2014) later presented four post-merger models, show-
ing that the angle-dependent, maximum-light spectra of
their most normal SN Ia-like 0.9 + 0.8 M(cid:12) model are not
also well-matched to most SN Ia belonging to the SCC class
(see also van Rossum et al. 2015). More recently, Dan et al.
(2015) reported on their post-merger remnant calculations
from an initial sample of nine WD conﬁgurations. Out of
the three models in fair agreement with spectroscopic abun-
dance estimates of “normal” SN Ia, the total masses for
those models are 1.6 M(cid:12) and 2.1 M(cid:12), where the former in-
volves a 0.45 M(cid:12) helium WD. A common theme for these
WD merger models is that the overlap between the bulk
of the carbon and intermediate-mass ejecta appears to be
dependent on the total progenitor mass and viewing angle.
In terms of observed line velocities, carbon-rich regions
of absorbing material for both normal and SCC SN Ia are
estimated to be spatially coincident with freshly synthesized
intermediate-mass elements, e.g., Mg, Si, S, and Ca (Branch
et al. 2005; Hicken et al. 2007). However, the measurable
degree of overlap between potentially unburned progenitor
material and regions of Mg, Si, and Ca remains uncertain on
account of excessive line-blending (van Rossum 2012; Foley
2013; Parrent et al. 2014). There is also evidence to sug-
gest the presence of multiple high velocity shells of Ca II in
the outermost ejecta (Thomas et al. 2004), which is more
than the single high velocity component typically assumed
for surveys of SN Ia spectra (e.g., Silverman et al. 2013;
Childress et al. 2014; Maguire et al. 2014; Pan et al. 2015).
In this article we supplement previously collected
data and analyse our time-series optical observations of
SN 2012dn during its photospheric phases, starting approxi-
mately 15 days prior to maximum light, with late-time cover-
age at ∼ 114 days after peak brightness. In §2 we present our
collected gri photometry and optical spectra. In §3 we assess
the peak absolute magnitude of SN 2012dn and compare to
light curves of other SN Ia prototypes. In §4 we examine
dissimilarities between the spectra of SN 2012dn and liter-
ature SN Ia. In §5 we outline our approach in utilizing the
fast and highly parameterized LTE line-identiﬁcation tool,
SYNAPPS (Thomas et al. 2011b). In §6 we analyse the spec-

post-maximum phases by Chakradhari et al. (2014) who col-
lected ten additional spectra from day +10.4 to day +98.2,
in addition to six photospheric phase spectra.

2 OBSERVATIONS
On 2012 July 8 UT an optical transient source with mg ∼< 16
was discovered at α(J2000) = 20h23m36s.26 and δ(J2000) =
−28o16’43”.4 by S. Parker of the Backyard Observatory Su-
pernova Search team (BOSS; Bock et al. 2012). We triggered
our Gemini-South Target-of-Opportunity programme (GS-
2012A-Q-20; PI, D. A. Howell) and obtained a ﬁrst spec-
trum of SN 2012dn on July 10 UT, which turned out to be
approximately 15 days before it reached peak b-band bright-
ness (Parrent & Howell 2012; Brown et al. 2014; Chakrad-
hari et al. 2014). This spectrum showed weak 6100 ˚A and
8200 ˚A features, along with a conspicuous 6300 ˚A signature,
that together suggested SN 2012dn to be a SCC SN Ia.

2.1 Photometry

Photometric observations using g’r’i’ ﬁlters were obtained
with the Spectral camera on Faulkes Telescope South (FTS),
spanning nearly a year of coverage (see Table 1 and Fig-
ure 1). Our observations began on 2012 July UT 16, about
four days after the Swift/UVOT photometry of Brown et al.
(2014) and Chakradhari et al. (2014). Images and ﬁltered
photon counts were processed and converted to SDSS gri
with an automatic pipeline of standard IRAF procedures
(see Valenti et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2014 for details).

2.2 Spectroscopy

Spectroscopic observations of SN 2012dn were obtained by
six facilities: Gemini-North and Gemini-South with GMOS
(Hook et al. 2004; Howell et al. 2012), South African Large
Telescope (SALT) with RSS (Burgh et al. 2003; Nordsieck
2012), Tillinghast Telescope with the FAST spectrograph
(Fabricant et al. 1998), Faulkes Telescope South (FTS) with
FLOYDS (Brown et al. 2013), and the Multiple Mirror Tele-
scope (MMT) using the Blue Channel instrument (Schmidt
et al. 1989). Data were reduced with IRAF, including Gem-
ini software add-on packages, and have been corrected for
host recessional velocities throughout this manuscript as-
suming a redshift of z = 0.010187 (Theureau et al. 1998).

For several FAST spectra, galaxy contamination is ap-
parent near 6563 ˚A, and telluric features have not been re-
moved in our data set (as indicated in Figure 2). We note
however that neither of these contaminants have signiﬁcant
eﬀect on our subsequent analysis of SN 2012dn spectra in
§6.

Assuming SN 2012dn reached b-band maximum light
on 2012 July UT 24.8 (Brown et al. 2014), optical spectra
of SN 2012dn were obtained from day −14.6 to day +10.2,
with a follow-up spectrum taken at +114.2 (see Table 2). In
total we collected 15 spectra over the course of its ﬁrst 25
days since discovery, with spectroscopic details probed out
to late post-maximum light phases, and are shown in the left
panel of Figure 2. Complimentary observations extend into

To estimate a date of maximum light, we utilize the mul-
ticolor light-curve ﬁtter, MLCS2k2 (Jha et al. 2007), with
our ﬁt shown in the right panel of Figure 1.1 We ﬁnd
that SN 2012dn reached B-band maximum light on MJD
56132.8 (2012 July UT 24.8), which is consistent with that
found from Swift/UVOT broadband photometry obtained
by Brown et al. (2014).

= 0.14 mag (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner
2011) and a Tully-Fisher distance modulus µ = 33.15 ± 0.52

≈ −19.03. (Brown et al. 2014 as-

To estimate the intervening host galaxy extinction, we
measure and ﬁnd an upper limit on the equivalent width
of a narrow Na D doublet to be ∼< 0.30 ˚A. Based on a re-
lation from Poznanski et al. (2012), we estimate the red-
dening due to the host, E(B−V)host, to be ∼< 0.03 mag.
By contrast, Chakradhari et al. (2014) report a color ex-
cess of E(B−V)host = 0.12 mag from reportedly resolved
Na D doublet measurements of 0.69 and 0.78, respectively.

We look to compare this with our light curve ﬁt in Fig-
ure 1, where MLCS2k2 handles reddening of the intrinsic spec-
tral energy distribution through two parameters, ∆ and AV ;
∆ is functionally dependent on the color diﬀerence between
high and low stretch light curves such that a SN Ia with
∆ = 1 (and AV = 0) is redder than in the case of ∆ = 0.
For SN 2012dn, MLCS2k2 returns ∆ = −0.56 ± 0.02, which
is out of range for the model, but is also indicative of an
intrinsically blue event.
To match the observed colors, MLCS2k2 compensates
for ∆ = −0.56 by overestimating additional reddening to
AV = 0.69 ±0.03; because the shape of SN 2012dn’s light
curves are not normal, MLCS2k2 returns an overestimate of
∼ 0.52. If there were half a magnitude
host extinction, AHost
of extinction from the host galaxy of SN 2012dn, one might
also expect to have a redder g − i color at maximum light.
Instead, below in §3.2 we ﬁnd the g − i color of SN 2012dn is
bluer than for SN 2006gz and slightly redder than SN 2009dc
during the epoch of peak brightness.

We also infer values for host-extinction with the
SALT2.4 light curve ﬁtter (Guy et al. 2007), and we ﬁnd
them to be roughly consistent with those obtained above

An additional uncertainty in the magnitude estimate for
SN 2012dn is from the distance modulus, where SN 2012dn
could have reached a peak luminosity of Mg ≈ −19.67
(MB ≈ −19.69 in B-band; Chakradhari et al. 2014). How-
ever, even this approximate upper limit on the inferred
peak luminosity for SN 2012dn is not far from the lumi-
nous end of seemingly spectroscopically “normal” events

Unlike MLCS2k2, SALT2 does not return an explicit dis-
tance. Therefore, it must be derived from calibration that
depends on cosmological parameters. To test systematics,
we adopt the two calibrations of Kessler et al. (2009) and
Guy et al. (2010) of µ = 32.987 ± 0.112 and 32.813 ± 0.145,
respectively, to obtain ¯µ = 32.9 ± 0.1, which is much lower
than µ = 33.24 from MLCS2k2. If the distance to ESO 462-
16 is indeed shorter, this still implies a peak brightness for
SN 2012dn that is lower than expected for its spectroscopic
class. Without accounting for reddening from the host, the
diﬀerence between peak absolute magnitudes inferred from
MLCS2k2 and SALT2 is ∼ 0.02 magnitudes in the B-band.

In spite of the uncertain host-galaxy extinction estimate
for SN Ia in general (Phillips et al. 2013; Foley et al. 2014a;
see also Cikota et al. 2016), our observations indicate Mpeak

class. Namely, the 1.08 mag decline in the B-band 15 days
after peak brightness is only slightly less than those for
the brighter end of normal SN Ia, e.g., SN 1990N, 1998bu,
2003du, all of which show signatures of C II in the outer-
most layers. In terms of the empirical light curve method
of Conley et al. (2008), SiFTO ﬁts to a light curve stretch,
s = 1.28, for SN 2012dn g and r-band light curves. For com-
parison, s ∼ 0.81 for SN 2006D; 0.82, 1994D; 0.86, 1996X;
0.91, 2002bo; 0.93, 2002dj; 0.96, 2005cf; 1.03, 2011fe; 1.04,
2003fg; 1.11, 1999aa; 1.26, 2001ay; and s ≈ 1.29 for 2009dc.
An additional characteristic of SN 2012dn that indi-
cates a non-standard, perhaps SN 2009dc-like origin is the
lack of well-pronounced secondary i-band maximum, or less
than what is typically observed for spectroscopically normal
SN Ia (Chakradhari et al. 2014). Within the context of the
width-luminosity relationship (Khokhlov et al. 1993; Phillips
1993; Phillips et al. 1999), the suppression of a secondary
maximum is consistent with spectroscopic indications that a
relatively late transition from doubly to singly-ionized iron-
peak elements has occurred (Kasen & Woosley 2007, and
see our §5). If there is a less pronounced secondary i-band
maximum for SN 2012dn, it would have occurred ∼10 days
or more ahead of “normal” SN Ia.

3.2 Colors

The UV ﬂux of SN Ia is wildly variable compared to optical
counterparts, which has highlighted UV wavelength regions
as a capable, albeit challenging probe for physics unseen
by optical wavelengths (Kirshner et al. 1993; Wang et al.
2012; Milne et al. 2013; Mazzali et al. 2014). Compared to
SN 2009dc, SN 2005cf and other normal SN Ia are typically
redder at NUV wavelengths prior to maximum light (Brown
et al. 2009; Milne et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2010, 2012), with
some fraction of “carbon-positive” events being relatively
bluer at NUV wavelengths (Thomas et al. 2011a; Milne et al.
2013). Brown et al. (2014) report the early UV colors of
SN 2012dn-like events are bluer than normal as well.
Plotted in Figure 3 are our g−r, g−i, and r−i col-
ors for SN 2012dn, select SCC SN Ia, and several spec-
troscopically normal SN Ia for reference. Without correct-
ing for dust extinction internal to the host galaxy, the
evolution of SN 2012dn’s g−r color-curve during the ﬁrst
month post-explosion is moderately comparable to the Core
= −19.30 ± 0.33) and a SCC,
Normal SN 2005cf (Mpeak
= −19.56 ± 0.18). The overall g−r color
SN 2006gz (Mpeak
of SN 2012dn also appears redder than other SN Ia in Fig-
ure 3. Perhaps this is either indicative of signiﬁcant host-
galaxy extinction, which is counter to what we ﬁnd through
equivalent-widths of narrow lines of Na D (§3.1), or the over-
all color-evolution might suggest a dusty environment local
to SN 2012dn (Maeda et al. 2009; Taubenberger et al. 2013).
SN 2005cf and 2006gz are also ∼ 30% redder than the sig-
= − 20.89 ± 0.54) on
niﬁcantly brighter SN 2009dc (Mpeak
this scale.
We attribute the early departure of SN 2012dn’s g−i
and r−i colors toward redder values during early post-
maximum phases to a relatively slow-declining i-band light
curve of 0.01 mag day−1 compared to 0.06 mag day−1 for
g-band. Between day +30 and day +85, SN 2012dn’s g-band
light curve declines by 0.03 mag day−1. SN 2007if underwent
a similar decline of ∼ 0.02 mag day−1 on similar timescales

color comparisons between SN 2012dn (yellow points) and super-
Chandrasekhar candidate SN 2006gz and 2009dc, Core Normal
SN 1990N, 2003du, and 2005cf, and the Broad Line SN Ia,
SN 2002bo (Ruiz-Lapuente & Lucy 1992; Phillips et al. 1992;
Benetti et al. 2004; Anupama et al. 2005; Stanishev et al. 2007;
Pastorello et al. 2007b; Wang et al. 2009b; Scalzo et al. 2010). In-
dividual color-curves have not been corrected for reddening from
the host-galaxy.

(Scalzo et al. 2010). Compared to Core Normal SN Ia where
the decline in g-band is also ∼ 0.03 mag day−1, a relatively
hastened late-time decline in brightness is only observed for
SN 2012dn at NUV and MUV wavelengths (Brown et al.
2014; Chakradhari et al. 2014).

4 COMPARISON OF SPECTRA

To assess the early spectroscopic evolution and approximate
overlap of ejected carbon, oxygen, and select intermediate-
mass elements, in the right panel of Figure 2 we plot the
photospheric phase spectra of SN 2012dn in terms of line
velocities O(v/c) for Si II λ6355, the Ca II infrared triplet
weighted by oscillator strengths (λ8579), C II λ6580, and
O I λ7774. For SN 2012dn we ﬁnd that faster unburned and
Si-rich material overlap, in part, below the outer extent of
Ca-rich absorbing layers, which is typical for Core Normal
SN Ia in terms of singular line velocities. See §5 where our
SYNAPPS analysis includes the relativistic correction term for
estimating projected Doppler velocities.

In the top panel of Figure 4, comparisons of SN 2012dn to
SCCs SN 2006gz, 2007if, and 2009dc during photospheric
epochs reveal moderate similarities across optical wave-
lengths. All share a fairly comparable pseudo-continuum
level in addition to superimposed atomic signatures during
this phase. Based on dissimilar appearances at blue-ward
wavelengths, one could argue SN 2007if, 2009dc, and 2012dn
do not belong to a similar class of events, particularly since
too few events have been studied to know which if any is
the most normal prototype. Still, while visual comparisons
between SN 2012dn and other SCC SN Ia during photo-
spheric phases suggest a match for this subtype, accurate
classiﬁcations of SN beneﬁt substantially from multi-epoch
observations.

4.2 Later Phases

In the bottom panel of Figure 4, we compare late post-
maximum spectra of SN 2012dn to a variety of peculiar
events. The spectra of SCC SN Ia and SN 2012dn share fairly
similar characteristics apart from small line shifts in individ-
ual features. It is thus reasonable to suspect that SN 2007if,
2009dc, and 2012dn are of a similar spectroscopic subclass
(Brown et al. 2014; Chakradhari et al. 2014).

The moderate contrast between late-time spectra of
SN 2012dn, a Core Normal (SN 2011fe), Cool (SN 1991bg),
and a more peculiar SN Ia (SN 2002cx; see McCully et al.
2014a,b; Foley et al. 2014b; Stritzinger et al. 2015) sug-
gests SN 2012dn is not strictly “well-matched” with normal
nor historically peculiar SN Ia. In particular, the 4700 and
5900 ˚A emission line regions of SCC SN Ia are not as promi-
nent compared to that of SN 2011fe, possibly due to rela-
tively sustained heating or less nickel synthesized during the
explosion. This might make sense given that SN 1991bg and
2002cx, as sub-luminous SN Ia, also show less pronounced
4700 ˚A and 5900 ˚A features.

5 SEMI-EMPIRICAL LINE IDENTIFICATIONS

For SN spectral features the accuracy of empirical measure-
ments depends on the prescriptions of lines utilized from a
supporting abundance model (Hatano et al. 1999b; Branch
et al. 2007). Studies of SN diversity thus beneﬁt when promi-
nent detections of select ions can be ruled out. Considering
the homogeneous nature of SN Ia spectra, the narrow fea-
tures of SCC SN Ia lend themselves particularly useful for
scrutinizing semi-empirical line-identiﬁcation schema (e.g.,
Scalzo et al. 2010; Doull & Baron 2011, and see also Foley
et al. 2010a).

5.1 The SYNAPPS Model

To estimate line velocities of select atomic species, we uti-
lize the fast and highly parameterized spectrum synthesis
code, SYNAPPS (Thomas et al. 2011b). The SYNAPPS model,
formerly SYNOW (Fisher 2000), assumes spherical symmetry,
a sharp photosphere, pure resonance line scattering treated
under the Sobolev approximation, and Boltzmann statis-
tics for electron level populations (parameterized by temp in

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–24

Direct Analysis of SN 2012dn Optical Spectra

SYNAPPS). For a given reference line, the radial dependence of
optical depth is assumed to be an outwardly decreasing ex-
ponential that is dependent on the optical depth at the pho-
tosphere (logtau), the photospheric velocity (vphot), the
detachment velocity for an ion (vmin), and an e-folding pa-
rameter (aux). Optical depths of the remaining lines assume
LTE level populations.

SYNAPPS essentially views photospheric phase super-
nova spectra as a non-linear superposition of resonance line
P Cygni proﬁles atop an underlying pseudo-continuum level.
While spectrum formation is not similarly trivial for super-
nova atmospheres (Bongard et al. 2008; Friesen et al. 2014),
the one-dimensional SYNAPPS model has served as a compli-
mentary tool to direct comparisons of observed spectra. In
certain situations, the rest-wavelength emission component
can undergo a similar blue-shift, as seen for the absorption
component (Baron et al. 1993; Anderson et al. 2014). As
the ejecta expands, geometric dilution may cause the rest-
wavelength emission to undergo a red-shift during later post-
maximum epochs (Friesen et al. 2012). The SYNOW/SYNAPPS
model is currently unable to account for these eﬀects on
account of an assumed sharp photosphere.

Two of the top-most SYNAPPS parameters are the rel-
ative velocities of included ions, vmin, and the relative
strengths of the lines which can be set by log τ . By hypothe-
sizing the prescription of lines that inﬂuence each composite
spectral feature, a synthetic spectrum can be minimized to
the data for the available parameter space. For SYNAPPS, this
is most often log τ , vphot, vmin, aux, and multiplied by the
number of ions included. In turn, this enables a tracing of a
monotonically decreasing vline over time (± δv; resolutions
set by local line-blending).

A reference continuum level is set by an assumed black-
body (TBB in SYNOW; tphot in SYNAPPS). Spectral energy dis-
tributions of SN I are not well-represented by blackbodies
(Bongard et al. 2006, 2008) and the same can be said for
SN II (Hershkowitz et al. 1986a,b; Hershkowitz & Wagoner
1987). However, the assumption for SYNAPPS is one of prac-
ticality and is not meant to be a reliable indicator of a real
temperature structure (see Fig. 5 of Bongard et al. 2008). In
SYNAPPS, quadratic warping constants a0, a1, and a2 supple-
ment tphot to form a more ﬂexible continuum reference level;
a0, a1, a2, and tphot form the backbone to data-driven min-
imization. (See Thomas et al. 2011b and Fig. 2 of Parrent
et al. 2012 for an example.)

Thus, for well-observed events, one can conduct vari-
ous experiments to directly assess: (i) detectable and infer-
able lines of noteworthy species, including C, O, Mg, Si, S,
Ca, Fe, and Co at photospheric (PV) and higher velocities
(HV); (ii) how to best utilize and constrain semi-empirical
line-measurements; (iii) the overlap of burned and remaining
progenitor material in terms of line velocities; (iv) the emer-
gence, cutoﬀ, and detachment velocities of select species;
(v) the time-dependent prescription and related uncertain-
ties for several composite features (Scalzo et al. 2014b; Mil-
isavljevic et al. 2015); and (vi) line-velocity gradients and
plateaus.

isons while perturbing the available parameters. As men-
tioned above, because parameterized expansion velocities,
vline, are traced by blended atomic signatures over time, the
convergence of vmin,Y (t) with SYNAPPS depends on the list of
actively contributing atomic species used as input. However,
since SYNAPPS does not solve for ionization balance, which is
a necessary step for abundance determinations and more de-
tailed analysis (Baron et al. 1996), semi-empirical ﬁts are de-
vised by perturbing compositional constructs (Hatano et al.
1999b). Synthetic ﬁts for a given set of ions can then be
processed forward and backward in phase space relative to
maximum light.

The mode of interpretation utilized by SYNAPPS is one
of an onion shell paradigm for the radiation transport in su-
pernova atmospheres, which is innately limited (cf. Blondin
et al. 2015). However, the SYNOW model can be used to con-
strain the compositional structure of ejected material in
spite of being conﬁned to Saha-Boltzmann statistics (Branch
et al. 2007; Parrent et al. 2010). A standard prescription
of ions for SN Ia stems from Hatano et al. (1999a,b) and
Branch et al. (2005), which is based on the time-dependent
inclusion of ions including C II, O I, Mg II, Si II, Si III,
S II, Ca II, Cr II, Fe II, Fe III, and Co II.

Previously, Branch (1977) showed how the location of
an absorption minimum does not always correspond to the
model photospheric velocity. This was found to occur for
both weak and saturated lines. To ensure minimal under
and over-shooting in vmin for each spectrum of SN 2012dn
(and similarly for SN 2011fe in Parrent et al. 2012), we re-
examined our preliminary results for a range of saturated
optical depths for each ion. Additionally, when vmin for any
ion was found to be oﬀ by more than 1000 km s−1 (a common
occurrence for Fe II, Fe III, and HV signatures), we per-
turbed vmin by ± 1000 km s−1, and repeated the above ﬁt-
ting methodology for the entire dataset. In the event that the
ﬁtting procedure produced either monotonically increasing
vmin,Y over time, or oscillatory solutions with amplitudes
exceeding 1000 km s−1, we interpreted this as an artifact of
adjacent and unaccounted for lines, vmin,Z (t), rather than
blue-ward shifting absorption signatures during a period of
photospheric recession (Branch & Patchett 1973; Kirshner
et al. 1973).

Because we are interested in extracting best estimates
of vmin for various species, we initially ﬁxed aux and temp
at default values of 103 km s−1 and 104 K, respectively, for
all but Ca II where we allowed aux to take on values greater
than 1000 km s−1 (see Branch et al. 2005). These parameters
were then free to vary near the end of our ﬁtting procedure.
We also allowed logmin to vary freely within appropriate
ranges when minimizing vmin,Y toward a monotonically de-
creasing function of time (see Hatano et al. 1999b; Branch
et al. 2005).

Hence, we deﬁne “best ﬁts” as satisfying the condition
that a ﬁt starting with iron-peak elements converge to a
similar consensus in vmin,Y for a ﬁt ending with the inclu-
sion of iron-peak elements (i.e., vmin to within 1000 km s−1
for each ion considered). With approximately three to ﬁve
seconds per output spectrum on average, the above vetting
process yields on the order of 1 − 2 x 103 synthetic spectrum
comparisons before vmin,Y (t) begins to converge toward a
global minimum in the available parameter space.

6 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

In this section we discuss a breakdown of our results, which
are shown in Figures 5−10 and later Figure 13 in §7.

6.1 Photospheric Velocities of C II

Owing in part to a lack of strong evidence for signatures
of high velocity features compared to more normal SN Ia,
the approximate rate of change in line velocities is report-
edly lower than normal for SCC SN Ia. Nonetheless, both
SN 2006gz and 2012dn have photospheric velocities typical
of normal SN Ia despite narrower than normal spectral fea-
tures (see Fig. 20 of Chakradhari et al. 2014). During early
photospheric phases, our analysis indicates line velocities of
∼ 14,000 km s−1 for Si II. From day −14.6 to day +5.6,
line velocities are consistent with having only reduced by
2000 − 3000 km s−1 to 11,000 − 12,000 km s−1 (cf. Fig-
ure 5 and 6).
Representative single-ion spectra of C II, O I, and Si II
are compared to SN 2012dn on day −14.6 in Figure 6. For
C II, the value of vmin that our full time-series ﬁtting con-
verges towards is slightly below that estimated for Si II
(12,000 − 13,000 km s−1 and 14,000 − 15,000 km s−1,
respectively) and is outside typical resolutions for vmin of
∼ 500 − 1000 km s−1; i.e., we conﬁrm that an improved
estimate of vmin for C II is not precisely 14,000 km s−1,
which is consistent with an independent SYNOW analysis by
Chakradhari et al. (2014). If such low projected Doppler ve-
locities reﬂect ejecta asymmetries, the slight mismatch with
vmin for Si II could be due to an oﬀ-center distribution of
carbon.

Finally we caution that lines of Fe II and Co II are
available for contaminating weak 6300 ˚A features by early
post-maximum light phases, thereby further motivating the
tracing of time-varying inferences of Fe II. However, by esti-
mating P Cygni summation of Cr II and Co II in the NUV

to the day −14.6 of SN 2012dn (in grey). Flux scale is arbitrary
and model vmin are given in units of km s−1 1000−1. Unlike for
gaussian ﬁtting methods and pseudo-equivalent widths of blended
spectral features, the plus symbols here and for the remaining ﬁg-
ures do not imply that line formation for SYNAPPS is treated as
linearly additive.

(Scalzo et al. 2010, 2014b; Brown et al. 2014), it is possible
to provide a soft upper limit to the blended strength of Fe II
and Co II that are permissible near 6300 ˚A (see §6.2 below).

6.2 Direct Inference of Detached Species

From the epoch of maximum light onward, lines of Fe II
are expected to inﬂuence a number of features at optical
wavelengths (cf. Figure 5 and Fig. 2 of Parrent et al. 2012).
However, while small contribution from Fe II can be inferred
near day +5.6, Fe II has yet to create a conspicuous and
therefore traceable signature during earlier phases. This in-
terpretation is marginally consistent with the lack of a well-
pronounced i-band double peak for SN 2012dn (Kasen 2006;
Chakradhari et al. 2014).

We interpret the lack of obvious Fe II signatures from
an incompatible match for the 4100 ˚A feature between the
model Fe II and observations (see Figure 7); i.e. prior to
maximum light, the evolution of SN 2012dn’s spectra do not
reveal signatures of Fe II that can be easily distinguished
from other species like Si II, Si III, S II, S III, and Fe III.
Still, this particular “non-detection” of PV Fe II does not
remove (PV + HV) Fe II from inﬂuencing the spectrum
during this epoch. Rather, the overall structure of the spec-
trum is diﬃcult to reconcile for a standard prescription of
PV Fe II as prescribed with LTE SYNAPPS.

Ultimately, the inference of high velocity iron-peak el-
ements is currently best served via more detailed model-
ing. However, to see more clearly when and where lines of
(PV + HV) Fe II sync with SN 2012dn spectra, in Figure 7
we show synthetic single-ion spectra of Fe II for vmin set to
18,000, 13,000 and 6000 km s−1 and compare them, respec-
tively, to the day −14.6, near-maximum light, and late-time

and 18,000 km s−1. At post-maximum light phases (after day
+10.6), Fe II overlaps nicely with the observed spectrum as a
species formed near the photospheric line forming region. At early
epochs (day −14.6), high velocity Fe II is a promising match. The

spectra of SN 2012dn.3 During early “nebular” phases, the
presence of permitted Fe II lines would be most consistent
near 6000 km s−1.

If weak signatures of detached HV Ca II and Fe II are
present in the spectra of SN 2012dn, then their respective
signatures would be consistent with observations assuming
line velocities above 18,000 km s−1 on day +5.6 and ear-
lier (see Figure 5). Earlier on day −9.7, the strength of
a 4000 ˚A absorption feature, which is signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
enced by Si II λ4131, is noticeably larger than normal (see
out Figure 8). This would suggest the relative strengths of
PV Si II λλ3858, 4131 could be utilized to rule out faint
signatures of detached HV Ca II (see also §5.4 of Blondin
et al. 2013).

To evaluate the potential inﬂuence of permitted lines
of Fe II and Co II on longer-lasting 6300 ˚A features dur-
ing post-maximum epochs, in Figure 9 we examine the day
+10.6 spectrum of SN 2012dn. Our full representative ﬁt
(in purple) also includes photospheric O I, Mg II, Si II, and
Ca II. Line velocities of O I are poorly constrained due to an
obscuring telluric feature, however during these epochs O I
is expected to be near line velocities of Si II. (This is also
shown in Figure 6.) By this time, permitted lines of Fe II are
consistent with observations for vmin near 11,000 km s−1.
When we add Cr II and Co II, the ﬁt (in orange) under-
goes a modest improvement blue-ward of 4100 ˚A. Without
high signal-to-noise UV coverage, however, we are unable to
push spectroscopic interpretations beyond generalizing the
presence of iron-peak elements. Therefore, while we suspect
6300 ˚A features are susceptible to contamination by per-
mitted signatures of Cr II and Co II during post-maximum
phases, we cannot precisely investigate the matter here.

investigated signatures of HV Fe II in the normal SN Ia 1994D.

6.3 Composite Features near 4110 and 4550 ˚A

The origins of the notches near 4110 ˚A and 4550 ˚A in
early SN Ia spectra have been diﬃcult to determine on ac-
count of excessive line-blending from several candidate ions.
For example, it would seem reasonable to associate both of
these features with C II λ4267 and λ4743, respectively. In
Figure 6, we show the close proximity of P Cygni proﬁles
C II λ4267 to 4110 ˚A and C II λ4743 to 4550 ˚A. It would be
advantageous if these features were signatures of unburned
progenitor material, particularly when both features in ques-
tion are in most SN Ia pre-maximum spectra for most SN Ia
subtypes (see Figures 5−8 in Parrent et al. 2014).

Whatever the source during photospheric phases, iden-
tifying the 4110 ˚A and 4550 ˚A notches as primarily indica-
tive of C II line-strengths, however, is not an accurate in-
terpretation, or at least not for SYNAPPS/SYNOW. A possi-
ble source for the confusion of 4550 ˚A features as resulting
from C II λ4743 is Fig. 1 of Hicken et al. (2007) where
the spectrum of SN 2006gz has been imprecisely labeled
for this particular feature. Below we show that the corre-
sponding SYNOW ﬁt is not in fact able to conﬁdently associate
C II λλ4267, 4743 with the 4110 ˚A and 4550 ˚A features.

6.3.1 The 4550 ˚A Feature

At the top of Figure 8 we compare SYNAPPS single-ion Si III
and S II spectra to the day −9.7 spectrum of SN 2012dn.
Several narrow features are largely consistent with being
shaped, in part, by S II during these photospheric phases.
When vmin and log τ for S II are adjusted to reproduce
the “S II W”, overlap with the 4550 ˚A feature is obtained
without an ad hoc tuning of the remaining SYNAPPS param-
eters. Therefore, rather than C II λ4743, we suspect the
4550 ˚A feature is instead at least S II, with every other ad-
jacent line inﬂuencing the blended strength of S II (including
C II λ4743 just barely red-ward of the 4550 ˚A notch).

Even when viewing the post-explosion common enve-
lope or disk region for select super-MCh merger models, the

Childress et al. 2015).

intensity minimum of a conspicuous C II λ4732 signature is
assuredly red-ward of the 4550 ˚A features, and particularly
when the associated C II λ6580 is less conspicuous (Raskin
et al. 2014). If one were to use SYNAPPS and force the C II to
match the 4550 ˚A feature, then C II λ6580 would not match
to the 6300 ˚A feature; i.e., the accompanying C II λ6580
signature does not hide well in the neighboring Si II feature
for vmin = 15,000 km s−1 (Parrent et al. 2011), nor is this
scenario expected for Broad Line SN Ia (Stehle et al. 2005;
Blondin et al. 2015).

One can also argue against C II λ4743 since the 4550 ˚A
feature shows up in the spectra of most SN Ia subtypes
during pre-maximum epochs. How then can near carbon-less
SN Ia (e.g., SN 2002dj, 2010jn; Hachinger et al. 2013) still
have a near-identical 4550 ˚A feature? Instead, we suspect
the feature may be primarily inﬂuenced by S II in those
cases as well.

If we instead consider SN 2009dc, an extreme example
where the C II λ6580 is more conspicuous than normal,
why does the weak 4550 ˚A not also follow this trend if it
is attributed to C II λ4743? Our guess here would at least
favor S II, with possibly some contribution from C II near
the red-most wing of the 4550 ˚A feature (see Figure 8).

From our SYNAPPS analysis, it is reasonable to suspect
that the 4550 ˚A region is also inﬂuenced by lines of Si III and
Fe II that show up blue-ward of 4550 ˚A (see Figures 6 and 8).
That is, the stronger than normal feature immediately blue-
ward of the 4550 ˚A notch is not well-matched by C II λ4743,
nor is it necessarily available. Better agreement is found with
Si III λ4560, which we suspect is then inﬂuenced propor-
tionately by Fe II over time. An interpretation of Si III is
reasonable considering the time-dependent presence of an
equally tentative detection of Si III on the red-most side of
the “S II W” (Thomas et al. 2007; Hachinger et al. 2012;
Sasdelli et al. 2014; and see our Figure 8 and §6.4). This
appears to be consistent with the same candidate ions from
the more detailed model spectra presented by Blondin et al.
(2015) for the Broad Line SN Ia 2002bo, yet additional inves-

6.3.2 The 4110 ˚A Feature

A similar set of conclusions follow when attempting to iden-
tify the 4110 ˚A feature, where both C II and Cr II have
been proposed as the primary sources:

– Many events of varying peculiarities harbor a 4110 ˚A
feature. This feature is blended for objects with either higher
mean expansion velocities or a shallower decline in opacity
along the line-of-sight. By contrast, this 4110 ˚A feature is re-
solved and therefore more conspicuous for objects with lower
mean expansion velocities that just so happen to have con-
spicuous C II λ6580 absorption features, but not necessarily
strong or detectable signatures of C II λ4267.

– Despite a relatively strong and long-lasting C II λ6580
absorption feature, the increasingly conspicuous 4110 ˚A fea-
ture for SN 2007if and 2009dc disfavors the interpretation
of a simultaneously prolonged detection of C II λ4267 for
at least epochs nearest to maximum light and thereafter
(Taubenberger et al. 2013).
– In Figure 10 we show that a deep and wide C II λ7234
absorption−as parameterized with high Boltzmann exci-
tation temperatures in SYNAPPS−is not comparable with
the observations during the relevant epochs. Furthermore,
it is likely that species including S II, Cr
II, and
(PV + HV) Fe II also inﬂuence the shape and depth of
the 4110 ˚A feature, and without invoking LTE excitation
temperatures greater than 15,000 K (Scalzo et al. 2010;
Taubenberger et al. 2013). Additionally, or at least for some
Broad Lined SN Ia during the ﬁrst 22 days post-explosion,
the region near 4110 ˚A overlaps with weak signatures of
S III λ4254 as well (Blondin et al. 2015); i.e. this for a sub-
type of SN Ia where high ionization species such as S III are
generally not considered for spectral decompositions.

– A C II λ4267 absorption feature is not well-matched to
the 4110 ˚A feature once the half-blended C II λ6580 line is
centered near 13,000 km s−1, nor at 12,000 km s−1. If the
4110 ˚A feature were simply due to C II λ4267 alone, then it
could be used to anchor vmin toward slightly lower values.
However, we cannot rule in C II λ4267 as primarily respon-
sible for the shape and evolution of the 4110 ˚A feature, and
this is in agreement with notions previously expressed by
Taubenberger et al. (2013).

6.4 C III λ4649

In the previous section we found C II is not particularly
favored as the primary contributor to the 4110 and 4550 ˚A
features. However, the degeneracy of candidate ions for these
weak features is many-fold, and simply in terms of unburned
carbon.

For example, C I λλ4772, 4932 may contribute to re-
gions near 4550 ˚A. Considering the low ionization potential
of neutral carbon, one might expect minimal contribution
from C I λλ4772, 4932. Therefore simultaneous optical+NIR
data and detailed modeling would be needed to investigate
further (H¨oﬂich et al. 2002; Marion et al. 2015; Hsiao et al.
2015).

In addition, the region between 4450 ˚A and 4550 ˚A in

Figure 10. The day −14.6 spectrum of SN 2012dn, plotted twice
in grey for clarity, is compared to a computed spectrum including
Si II and C II, and single-ion calculations for S II, Cr II, and
Fe II. Excitation temperatures (in units of Kelvin x 1000−1) and
expansion velocities (in units of km s−1 x 1000−1) are varied for
C II and S II as shown. Vertical dashed lines mark the locations
of the 4100 ˚A and 4550 ˚A features.

the day −14.6 spectrum of SN 2012dn could be inﬂuenced by
C III λ4649 with a line velocity of ∼ 9600−13,000 km s−1.
Given a relatively weak 4550 ˚A signature, we did not in-
clude C III in the prescription of ions used for SN 2012dn in
the previous sections. However, SYNAPPS would favor C III
closer to vmin = 12,000 km s−1 (± 1000 km s−1) given the
consistency with values inferred from other species. More
over, both C III and S III have similar ionization poten-
tials, and this pairing has been suggested for SN Ia such as
SN 1991T, 1997br, and 1999aa (Hatano et al. 2002; Garavini
et al. 2004; Parrent et al. 2011).

In Figure 11 we compare pre-maximum spectra of
SN 1991T, 1997br, 1999aa, and 2012dn. We have also plot-
ted the day −7 spectrum from the delayed-detonation series
computed by Sasdelli et al. (2014) who concluded that the
carbon-rich progenitor material in SN 1991T was burned
out to ∼ 12,500 km s−1, leaving no signatures of carbon
(top of Figure 11 in red). In Figure 11 we also compare
SN 1991T to a preliminary SYN++ spectrum. With vmin set
to 11,500 km s−1 (± 1000 km s−1) for each ion, the ﬁt
includes mostly Fe III, but also minor contributions from
C III, Si II, Si III, S III, Fe II, Co III, and Ni II as these
species do a fair job at reproducing most features.

As was previously discussed by Hatano et al. (2002),
Garavini et al. (2004), and Parrent et al. (2011), there is
a distinct feature near 4500 ˚A in the pre-maximum spec-
tra of SN 1991T, 1997br, and 1999aa that could be sig-
niﬁcantly shaped, in part, by C III λ4649 forming near
∼11,500 km s−1. Sasdelli et al. (2014) claim “carbon lines
are never detected” for SN 1991T in spite of the well-placed
weak signature near 4500 ˚A, yet this feature is not repro-
duced in the computed spectra of Sasdelli et al. (2014) for
an alternative interpretation.

the model is inaccurate (possibly due to an assumed diﬀusive

bon has been burned in the model. Without more advanced
analysis of SN 1991T spectra from PHOENIX and CMFGEN, we
therefore cannot rule out an identiﬁcation of C III in these
SN 1991T-like events.

Singly-ionized species might also account for some of
the more weaker features observed for SN 1991T-like events.
For example, by day −7 for SN 1991T it is diﬃcult to rule
out weak contribution from Si II near 6150 ˚A. Notably, the
computed spectrum of Sasdelli et al. (2014) shown in our
Figure 11 does not account for the 6150 ˚A feature until three
days later (see their Fig. 2).

A more ﬂeeting identiﬁcation for SN 1991T−one
that would further support the tentative detection of
C III λ4649−is that of C II λ6580. Curiously, a weak depres-
sion red-ward of 6300 ˚A is present in the day −11 spectrum
of SN 1991T and for sometime thereafter.

In Figure 12 we compare time-series

spectra of
SN 2012dn and 1991T in terms of line velocities O(v/c) of
C II λλ6580, 7234 in order to access any common overlap be-
tween these two line signatures. This method was exploited
by Parrent et al. (2011) for more normal SN Ia, where it
was found to be a good indicator of detectable C II (see
also Thomas et al. 2004). Therefore, while we attempt to
take advantage of common overlap in the Doppler frame in
Figure 12, we also emphasize that ﬁrst-order estimates of
projected Doppler velocities are not accurate, much less for

Direct Analysis of SN 2012dn Optical Spectra

15

From the available data on SN 1991T, invoking a de-
tection of weak C II λλ6580, 7234 is troublesome. In par-
ticular, it is unclear where the would-be feature spanning
6350−6720 ˚A ends and where the continuum begins. Fur-
thermore, bonaﬁde absorption signatures of C II λ6580 in
normal SN Ia are not often reported red-ward of ∼ 6420 ˚A
(Pereira et al. 2013).
By comparison, the bulk of the C II λ6580 signature in
the day +5.6 spectrum of SN 2012dn extends to ∼ 6520 ˚A,
with a ﬂat component extending toward ∼ 6600 ˚A. However,
absorption from a parent line of C II λ6580 is not thought to
be physical beyond a rest-wavelength of 6580 ˚A during pho-
tospheric phases. Therefore our best interpretation is that
the ﬂat component centered about 6580 ˚A is a result of either
competing emission between C II and Si II, or an indication
that some C II is conﬁned to a blob or shell-like structure
(see Jeﬀery & Branch 1990; Thomas et al. 2007).
As for SN 1991T, the feature nearest to 6580 ˚A is clearly
too far red-ward to be associated with C II by day −6.
However prior to day −7, what exactly is producing the
minimum is unclear, yet the observations are not necessarily
consistent with a non-detection of faint C II. In Figure 12,
the day −10 spectra of SN 1991T from Mazzali et al. (1995)
(solid green) and Filippenko et al. (1992) (dashed-green) are
also too noisy to search for a weaker signature of C II λ7234.
For SN 2012dn, where C II λ6580 is detected with a
mean expansion velocity of ∼ 12,500 km s−1, a weak 4450 ˚A
feature that can be reasonably pinned to C III λ4649 at
∼ 12,500 km s−1 is only observed on day −14.6, and is there-
fore unconﬁrmed as a feature. Thus, while we cannot rule
out contribution from C III near 4450 ˚A, it would appear
that signatures from C III are minimal for SN 2012dn during
photospheric phases.

7 DISCUSSION

If a companion star is necessary for the runaway explosion
of SN Ia-like events (cf. Chiosi et al. 2015), its identity and
role in the diversity of post-explosion spectra remain fairly
ambiguous (Moll et al. 2014; Maeda et al. 2014; Tanikawa
et al. 2015). Additionally, there are many scenarios that may
explain spectroscopic diversity as projections of distinct pro-
genitor systems. Extreme events, e.g. SN 1991bg and 2002cx,
may result from mechanisms or progenitor channels that are
distinct from those most representative of the true norm of
SN Ia (Hillebrandt et al. 2013 and references therein). A true
norm could also originate from multiple binary conﬁgura-
tions and explosive conditions (Benetti et al. 2005; Blondin
et al. 2012; Dessart et al. 2014). Similarly, select subclasses
may either represent bimodal characteristics of one or two
dominant channels (Maeda et al. 2010; Maund et al. 2010;
R¨opke et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2015), or a predominant family
where continuous diﬀerences such as progenitor metallici-
ties (among other parameters) yield the observed diversity
(Nugent et al. 1995; Lentz et al. 2000; H¨oﬂich et al. 2002;
Scalzo et al. 2014a; Maeda et al. 2014). A dominant one (or
two) progenitor system + explosion mechanism might then
manifest properties about the norm that reach out into the

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–24

Nevertheless, an intriguing circumstance for SN Ia is
that the evolution of spectral features, and possibly the spec-
troscopic make-up, of Core Normal events can be consid-
ered similar, as a whole, to those of SN 2006gz, 2009dc, and
2012dn. Perhaps this would not be surprising since both
classes of SN Ia are expected to originate from WD pro-
genitor systems. However, here we are referring to traceable
similarities between Core Normal and SCC SN Ia in the con-
text of the contrasting spectroscopic make-up compared to
peculiar SN 1991T-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like events
(Branch et al. 2004; Parrent et al. 2011; Doull & Baron
2011).4

7.1 Does a unique physical sequence exist

between normal and SN 2012dn-like events?

If we assume that most normal SN Ia yield similar rise-
times (∼ 19 days), near-maximum light expansion veloci-
ties (∼ 11,000 km s−1), and opacities (κ = 0.1 cm2 g−1),
the values assumed for SN 2012dn (vmax ∼ 11,000 km s−1,
trise ∼ 20 days; Chakradhari et al. 2014)
indicate
ej ∼ (90 − 120%) × MCh = 1.3 − 1.7 M(cid:12). “By mass,”
M12dn
SN 2012dn is not clearly SN 2009dc-like despite appear-
ances (cf. Pinto & Eastman 2000a,b; Foley et al. 2009).5
Furthermore, Chakradhari et al. (2014) used Arnett’s rule
bol = 43.27 erg s−1 to estimate that
(Arnett 1982) and logLpeak
SN 2012dn produced 0.70 − 0.94 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. Assuming
SN 2011fe and SN 2012dn have similar rise-times, Brown
et al. (2014) estimated the mass of 56Ni could be as low as
∼ 0.5 M(cid:12), where part of the uncertainty is in the rise-time
of SN 2012dn.6 By comparison, the bolometric luminosity of
SN 2011fe is consistent with the production of ∼ 0.42 − 0.64
M(cid:12) of 56Ni (Pereira et al. 2013), which is anywhere between
half as much to slightly less than the amount of 56Ni inferred
for SN 2012dn.

For SN 2012dn, a signiﬁcant fraction of the luminosity
may be due to close circumbinary interaction with C+O-rich
material. Therefore, the inferred mass of 56Ni needed to re-
produce the observed rise-time would be artiﬁcially higher

4 For comparison among proposed spectral sequences of SN, a
far more diverse set of events, i.e. those of type IIbIbc and IIPLn,
separately, are sometimes viewed as also forming a physically re-
lated sequence of progenitor conﬁgurations (Nomoto et al. 1996;
Claeys et al. 2011; Dessart et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2015, see
also Maurer et al. 2010). For SN IIbIbc, one of the key ques-
tions is how many “hydrogen-poor SN IIb” are misidentiﬁed as
“hydrogen-poor SN Ib” when both events are primarily discov-
ered and typed during a “type Ib” phase (Chevalier & Soderberg
2010; Arcavi et al. 2011; Milisavljevic et al. 2013; Folatelli et al.
2014; Parrent et al. 2015).

Figure 13. Initial SYNAPPS measurements and comparisons
between the “Core Normal”, low-velocity gradient (CN/LVG)
SN 2011fe and the SCC SN 2012dn. Symbols are deﬁned in the
left panel. Red and blue colors denote the span of inferred line
velocities for C II λ6580 and O I λ7774, respectively, and the pur-
ple shade indicates overlap between the two. Owing to spectro-
scopic blending of weak identifying signatures, estimates for C II
and O I are given as broad ranges corresponding to C II λ6580
and O I λ7774, respectively, rather than more well-determined
vmin(t).

(Taubenberger et al. 2013). Brown et al. (2014) also re-
port that the integrated luminosities of SN 2011aa, 2012dn
(two SCC SN Ia), and the normal and already NUV-blue
SN 2011fe are quite similar despite the brighter UV lumi-
nosities for the SCC SN Ia (Milne & Brown 2012; Milne
et al. 2013). Thus it seems plausible that SN 2011fe and
SN 2012dn could have produced comparable amounts of 56Ni
(± 0.10 − 0.20 M(cid:12)), where SN 2012dn obtained additional
luminosity from close interaction (∼< 109 cm) with a larger
exterior region of carbon-rich material.

Our estimates of vmin for C II, O I, Si II, and Ca II
for SN 2011fe and 2012dn are shown in Figure 13. Notably,
SN 2006gz, 2009dc, 2011fe, and 2012dn show a similar over-
lap between O, Si, and Ca-rich material, while carbon-rich
regions for SCC SN Ia share similar velocities found for Core
Normal SN Ia as well (∼ 11,000 − 15,000 km s−1). Com-
pared to SN 2011fe, SN 2012dn only displays lower param-
eterized expansion velocities of PV Si II during the initial
stages of homologous expansion; i.e., PV Si II in SN 2011fe
falls below that of SN 2012dn shortly thereafter between
day −10 and day −5.

For SN 2012dn, a non-detection of strong HV Ca II is
obvious upon visual inspection of the 8200 ˚A feature. How-
ever, we cannot rule out a faint signature of trace HV Ca II
at ∼ 19,000 km s−1 during pre-maximum epochs (§6.2). If a
region of detached HV Ca II exists along the light-of-sight
for SN 2012dn, then it is coincident with the lower extent of
parameterized HV Ca II found in SN 2011fe (see Figure 13).
Such considerations neither prove nor suggest that pro-
genitor channels producing Core Normal and SCC SN Ia
subtypes are remotely identical, and similarly among other
SN Ia prototypes. Rather, they underscore the need for ad-
ditional detailed investigations of spectroscopic degeneracies
from single and double-degenerate scenarios (R¨opke et al.
2012; Miles et al. 2015; Dan et al. 2015).

7.2 Diﬀerentiation Through Environmental

Properties

It may be possible to isolate candidate progenitor scenarios
by noting the properties of the host-environment and host
galaxy of a given event or SN Ia subclass (Hamuy et al.
1995; Hicken et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013; Pan et al. 2014;
Foley 2015; Maguire et al. 2015). The general ﬁnding has
been that brighter, “higher-stretch SN Ia” tend to occur in
metal-poorer environments of low-mass host galaxies (Sul-
livan et al. 2010; Childress et al. 2011; Khan et al. 2011),
while sub-luminous, “low-stretch SN Ia” are preferentially
detected in environments indicative of an older (or delayed)
population of progenitor systems (Howell 2001; Gallagher
et al. 2008).

However, this assumes that each spectroscopic sub-
type identically follow the above mantra, per host-property,
which may not be the case (Hicken et al. 2009). Speciﬁcally,
the light curve stretch of one particular progenitor class
or SN Ia spectroscopic subtype, may tend to increase with
metal-poor environments while another may not (Kobayashi
& Nomoto 2009; Kistler et al. 2013). In turn, this could
serve as a means for separating progenitor scenarios or a
sequence of progenitor masses for one dominant progenitor
family (Scalzo et al. 2014a,c). However, the extent of such
an eﬀect remains unclear given the diﬃculty of classifying
events from sporadically sampled spectra.

Below we use empirical relations found in the literature
to place crude estimates on the host-galaxy mass and lo-
cal metallicity to compare SN 2012dn to so-called nearest
neighbor SN Ia (Jeﬀery et al. 2007). We also inspect the
percentages of SN Ia subclasses in the Palomar Transient
Factory (PTF, Rau et al. 2009; Maguire et al. 2014) sam-
ple that was recently utilized by Pan et al. (2014, 2015) to
investigate possible correlations between SN Ia light curve
stretch and local properties of the host environment.

7.2.1 Estimation of Host Galaxy Mass and Metallicity

SN 2012dn is located 35” west and 3” south of the
purportedly normal spiral (SAcd) galaxy, ESO 462-16
(= PGC 64605; Bock et al. 2012), which belongs to a pair
of binary galaxies (Soares et al. 1995). To estimate the host
galaxy mass of SN 2012dn and hosts of other SN Ia (§6.2.2),
we implement the empirical relation of Taylor et al. (2011):

logM/M(cid:12) = 0.70(g − i) − 0.40MI,AB − 0.68

(1)

and values obtained from NED and LEDA.7

Since our estimates here are not for precision cos-
mology, we assume representative errors by computing
logMStellar ≡ logM/M(cid:12) from Eq. 1 for the host of SN 2011fe,
M101, and comparing to logMStellar = 10.72+0.13−0.12 ob-
tained by van Dokkum et al. (2014). Assuming g−i = 1.0,

Mpc−1; Hinshaw et al. 2013) for M101, Eq. 1 yields
logMStellar ∼ 8.6. Following the same procedure for the

host of SN 2012dn, and taking the above discrepancy for
M101 as a conservative error estimate, we obtain a broad
window (±2.2) for all points in Figure 15 below; i.e. approx-
imately two orders of magnitude too broad to draw associ-
ation with a particular progenitor environment or scenario
for the present study.

We estimate the metallicity of SN 2012dn’s progenitor
from optical spectroscopy of the host environment. The SN
ﬂux dominates the host galaxy emission lines at the precise
location of the explosion site, so we instead extract spec-
tra from three nearby H II regions which intersected our
spectroscopic slit. To model the emission line spectra and
measure the ﬂuxes of the strong emission lines, we apply
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method of Sanders et al.
(2012b). We then estimate metallicity using the N2 and
O3N2 diagnostics of (Pettini & Pagel 2004; hereafter, PP04).
Our spectra do not cover the [O II] λ3727 line, and we are
therefore unable to estimate metallicity using diagnostics
based on the R23 line ratio.8

We ﬁnd metallicity values

ranging between
log(O/H)(cid:12) + 12 = 8.4 − 8.6, or ∼ 0.4 − 0.8 Z(cid:12)
on the PP04 scale (Z(cid:12) ≡ log(O/H)(cid:12) + 12 = 8.69; As-
plund et al. 2005). The uncertainty in this estimate is
small, ∼ 0.05 dex as estimated from propagation of the
emission line ﬂux uncertainties. In particular, we ﬁnd
log(O/H)(cid:12) + 12 = 8.48 ± 0.06 in the PP04N2 diagnostic
for the region nearest to the explosion site. This uncertainty
is likely to be dominated by systematic eﬀects such as
the calibration variance in the strong line metallicity
diagnostics, local metallicity variation in the host galaxy,
and chemical evolution and host environment physical
oﬀset associated with the delay time between the birth and
explosion of the progenitor star (Kewley & Ellison 2008;
Sanders et al. 2012a,b, see also Pan et al. 2014; Toonen
et al. 2014; Soker 2014).

On average, the metallicity inferred for the local envi-
ronment of SN 2012dn places it at higher values relative to
other SCC SN Ia (see Table 3). If these values were accurate
enough for comparisons (cf. Niino et al. 2015), then at face
value they would imply SN 2012dn originated from a pro-
genitor with a metallicity no less than those giving rise to
SN 2003fg, 2009dc, and the Core Normal SN 2011fe. How-
ever, it is only the metallicity estimate for SN 2011fe that
stems from comparisons of UV spectra and abundance to-

mography (Mazzali et al. 2015; Baron et al. 2015). Thus the
context by which to properly estimate and interpret progen-
itor metallicities with certainty remains absent (Brown et al.
2015).

7.2.2 Bulk Trends in SN Ia Samples

Visual classiﬁcation of SN spectra is sometimes described
as a subjective or ambiguous process, whereby a computer
is needed to facilitate the problem (Sasdelli et al. 2015).9
Between normal and peculiar events, or events within one
subclass, this is somewhat true for noisy, post-maximum
phase spectra, i.e., when spectroscopic diversity declines be-
tween most SN Ia subtypes (Branch et al. 2009 and ref-
erences therein). However, the unambiguous patterns estab-
lished by pre-maximum light data indicate sub-classiﬁcation
can be done by-eye when the event is caught early enough
and followed-up by campaigns of high quality observations.
This is because noticeable diﬀerences of both major and mi-
nor features are often related to respective diﬀerences in the
composition of the outermost regions of ejecta (Tanaka et al.
2008).

With today’s large spectrum-limited datasets, a com-
puter is indeed ideal for charting dissimilarities between
events in a given subclass, such as homogeneous Core Nor-
mal events most similar to SN 2011fe. This assumes, how-
ever, that some of the under-observed events in either a given
sample or pre-deﬁned subclass are not caught-late or “pe-
culiar” outliers for a neighboring, and possibly unrelated,
subclass such as Broad Line SN Ia (see also Folatelli et al.
2014; Parrent et al. 2015). In fact, there is curious overlap
between events that have been typed as “high velocity Core
Normal” and “normal velocity Broad Line” SN Ia (Blondin
et al. 2012; Parrent 2014). Therefore, the vetting process
for these and other subclasses of type I supernovae would
beneﬁt from spectral decomposition through gaussian pro-
cesses (Fakhouri et al. 2015) and machine learning methods
(Sasdelli et al. 2015).

From a sample of 82 PTF SN Ia, Pan et al. (2014) con-
ducted a follow-up investigation of empirical relationships
between SN Ia light curve stretch and various properties of
the host environment, including host galaxy mass, speciﬁc
star formation rates, and gas-phase metallicities. Previous
conclusions were reached insofar as the stellar mass of the
host is correlated in the light curve shape of the subsequent
explosion (Sullivan et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2014). However, as
with most previous surveys of SN Ia host-environments, vi-
sual details on the spectroscopic diversity of this most recent
sample were omitted (see later Pan et al. 2015).

In terms of signal-to-noise ratios and spectroscopic
follow-up, it is important to note the data of the 82 PTF
SN Ia are of low to moderate quality. Similar to spectra
obtained by the SuperNova Legacy Survey, PTF SN come
with a few sporadically sampled optical spectra on average.

9 This problem is not unique to supernova spectra. Solar spec-
troscopists, among others, have faced a similar debate, and we
refer the reader to p. 23 of “Stellar Spectral Classiﬁcation” (Gray
& Corbally 2009) and Keenan (1984) where visual classiﬁcation
of stellar spectra is discussed.

siﬁcation criteria of Branch et al. (2006); ﬁlled black circles for
Core Normal, green for Broad Line, red for Shallow Silicon, blue

As sub-classiﬁcations of supernovae are more accurately de-
termined by time-series datasets, a lack of coverage inhibits
a precise recording of those deﬁning features most often as-
sociated with spectroscopic peculiarity, particularly during
pre-maximum phases. For a visualization of this, Parrent
et al. (2014) presented a follow-up eﬃciency diagram in their
Fig. 4. The PTF sample was included in this diagram, falling
toward the bottom-left corner of their ﬁgure inset.

Since we cannot attempt a consistent quantiﬁcation of
known subtypes for the PTF sample, our assessments here,
and similarly for the study of high velocity features by Pan
et al. (2015), are based on visual comparisons to time-series
observations of SN Ia that have been designated as “well-
observed” throughout the literature. Several examples of our
by-eye sub-classiﬁcations are detailed in Figure 14.

To illustrate the distribution of SN Ia subtypes for a
given SN sample, we focus on the light curve stretch versus
logMStellar plane (see Fig. 9 of Pan et al. 2014). In Figure 15
we have replotted the PTF sample as grey + symbols. The
colors per subtype are in reference to the classiﬁcation crite-
ria of Branch et al. (2006); ﬁlled black circles for Core Nor-
mal, green for Broad Line, red for Shallow Silicon, blue for
Cool, and purple for super-Chandrasekhar mass candidate
events. For PTF SN Ia that appear normal but are suspected
as having properties of neighboring subtypes, e.g., Core Nor-

Horizontal bars represent the span of light curve stretch for each

with the light curve stretch axis. However, for the purposes of
plotting all literature SN Ia, the triangles represent lower limit
estimates of host galaxy mass as derived from Equation 1 and
normalized to that for M101. Errors for PTF objects are retained
from Pan et al. (2014). [Note] In a previous version of Parrent
(2014), the value for SN 2012dn’s stretch in the plot did not match
the correct value in §3 of this work.

as SN 1999aa, we have marked these as colored open-circles
where appropriate, and we consider this as an error estimate
below. Objects for which a spectroscopic subtype could not
be determined from an appropriate time-series dataset are
marked as grey ×s. A number of these cases are related to an
inability to disentangle normal velocity SN 1984A-like from
high[er] velocity SN 1994D-like events, even after enforcing
an artiﬁcial selection criterion such as a maximum light sep-
aration velocity of 11,800 km s−1 (Wang et al. 2009a) or
12,200 km s−1 (Blondin et al. 2012).

In Table 4 we list estimates of SN Ia subtype percent-
ages for the sample in terms of SiFTO light curve stretch and
ﬁnd considerable room for additional trends, per subtype.
Here, the overall trend between logMStellar and light curve
stretch is built from a heterogenous aggregate of visibly dis-
tinct SN Ia, with traceable peculiarities, that may or may
not be physically related to other spectroscopic subtypes in-
cluded in the sample. As such, the claim of “higher stretch
SN Ia originate from low mass, metal-poor environments”
is not explicitly with regards to Core Normal, SN 2011fe-
like SN Ia with light curve stretch values between 0.8 and
1.3 (see Figure 15). Pan et al. (2014) do not claim otherwise,
however we ﬁnd it important to explicitly show these details
when addressing bulk trends pertaining to, e.g., properties
of the host.

The percentages of each subtype in the PTF sample are
also distinct from those found in the volume-limited sam-
ple of Li et al. (2011), where SN Ia were classiﬁed by like-
ness to a few historical prototypes (cf. Filippenko 1997 and
Fig. 13 of Doull & Baron 2011). We suspect a quantitative
re-evaluation of SN Ia subtypes would better elucidate the
multitude of trends involving SN Ia rates and host-galaxy
properties.

7.2.3 Correlations with Ca II at High Velocities

Pan et al. (2015) later analysed properties of Si II λ6355
and the Ca II near-infrared triplet proﬁles for 122 SN Ia
and found trends relating to the stellar mass and star for-
mation rates of the host galaxy. In particular, Pan et al.
(2015) recover a trend, previously found by Maguire et al.
(2012, 2014) and Childress et al. (2014), where maximum
light spectra that have strong signatures of HV Ca II tend
to also have broader light curves. All of these works de-
duce the relative strengths and velocities (weighted by the
blended absorption minimum) of high velocity features near
maximum light using up to ﬁve gaussian absorption proﬁles
to encompass 11 P Cygni-like lines; i.e., eﬀectively narrow-
band pass-ﬁlters with one gaussian for PV Si II λ6355 and
four gaussians for PV and HV Ca II to represent two un-
constrained components of H&K and the infrared-triplet.

During pre-maximum epochs, such methods can break
down without the inclusion of either parameterized HV Si II,
or an extended region of Si II in absorption (cf. Blondin
et al. 2015). Furthermore, it is not often that signatures of
detached HV Si II are as prominently observed as in the case
of the peculiar SN 2012fr (Childress et al. 2013), nor does
an interpretation of distinctly detached shells of HV Si II
and HV Ca II necessarily follow quantitative consistency
between observations and a prescription of PV + HV Si II
and Ca II (Baron et al. 2015).

Direct Analysis of SN 2012dn Optical Spectra

Additionally, parameterized HV components of Si II
and Ca II inferred for the normal SN Ia 2011fe are not
coincident in such a way that one can readily deduce the
outermost extent of Ca II from that of Si II (see our Fig-
ure 13). Moreover, the estimated expansion velocities for
a detached component of HV Ca II can be uncertain by
2000−8000 km s−1 depending on the width of the feature
and the observational coverage (see Fig 3 of Parrent 2014).
There has also been evidence for multiple shells of high ve-
locity Ca II, as suggested for SN 2000cx (Thomas et al.
2004, see also Silverman et al. 2013).

Weak signatures of C I, O I, Mg II, and Fe II might
also inﬂuence wavelengths that undergo absorption from the
Ca II infrared-triplet. For events where there are suﬃciently
early pre-maximum spectra, e.g., SN 1994D and 2011fe, sig-
natures of HV O I may be present as well (Branch et al.
2005; Nugent et al. 2011; Parrent et al. 2012). Near maxi-
mum light, one might also expect increased absorption from
O I for fast-decliners such as SN 1991bg, 1997cn, 1999by,
2000dk, 2005bl, and 2007fr (Doull & Baron 2011 and ref-
erences therein). More signiﬁcant contributions may come
from lines of Co II (Blondin et al. 2015). This translates
to possibly overestimating contributions from parameterized
PV Ca II and underestimating the extent of trace Ca II at
relatively higher velocities, which can go unconﬁrmed with-
out observations prior to ∼ day −7.

Silverman et al. (2015) recently improved upon the
methods of Maguire et al. (2012, 2014), Childress et al.
(2014), and Pan et al. (2015) by considering gf-weighted line-
strengths. Silverman et al. (2015) also test their method by
ﬁtting 11 out of 445 spectra with SYNAPPS. Some of their
preliminary ﬁts include PV components of O I, Mg II, Si II,
Si III, S II, Ti II, Fe II, Fe III, and an additional HV com-
ponent of Ca II.

Using SYNAPPS in this manner can eﬀectively conﬁrm
the need for parameterizing HV Si II and HV Ca II, how-
ever it does not support an accurate determination of pa-
rameterized velocities from gaussian ﬁtting methods where
fewer ions are incorporated. This is primarily because the
broad features of supernova spectra enable a gross approx-
imation of semi-empirical quantities, which are dependent
on optical-depth eﬀects and ionization gradients in the out-
ermost regions of ejecta.

On this point, the six ﬁts shown in Fig. 1 of Silverman
et al. (2015), and particularly for SN 1994D, 2002dj, and
2012fr, indicate either an over/under-shooting of velocities,
or overly saturated lines. Silverman et al. (2015) do in fact
attribute some of the discrepancies in their ﬁts to the de-
generacy between SYNAPPS parameters, vmin,Y and logtau.
Although, Silverman et al. (2015) do not show the simul-
taneous ﬁt to the H&K and infrared-triplet region for any
event (see also Fig. 1 of Ben-Ami et al. 2015 and Fig. 17 of
Pignata et al. 2011), which is important for zeroing-in on
self-consistent estimates of vmin,Y . Moreover, degeneracies
between SYNAPPS parameters can be broken from time-series
ﬁtting, and can also result in an improved time-dependent
(and model-dependent) accuracy of a supposed separation
velocity.

Still, studies that have attempted a complete tracing of
SN Ia spectral features with SYNAPPS do not unanimously
produce estimates of vmin better than ∼ ±1000 km s−1
(Parrent et al. 2012; Parrent 2014; and this work). Overall,

the direct analysis methods of Parrent et al. (2012), Maguire
et al. (2012, 2014), Childress et al. (2014), Pan et al. (2015),
and Silverman et al. (2015) are so far unable to determine
when a broad feature is due to a detached (and blended)
component at higher velocities, and when the width of that
feature is produced by a changing ionization gradient. These
methods do give credence to the inclusion of parameterized
HV components, but the inferred separation velocities re-
main uncertain outside of events similar to SN 2012fr.

Near maximum light, it is true that most events no
longer harbor a strong feature near 8000 ˚A, or at least not
similar to those of SN 1999ee, 2001el, and 2004S (which do
not appear to have been included in the studies done by
Childress et al. 2014 and Silverman et al. 2015). However,
the inclusion of Broad Line events in the sample of Chil-
dress et al. (2014), such as SN 2006X, is debatable con-
sidering that line velocities for the Ca II infrared-triplet
in SN 2006X overlap those of HV Ca II in some normal
SN Ia (16,000−25,000 km s−1), yet some have interpreted
SN 2006X as having no high velocity features because there
are no distinguishable signatures of HV Ca II upwards of
20,000−30,000 km s−1 prior to maximum light (see also Sil-
verman et al. 2015).

For SN Ia that exhibit spectral features of high ion-
ization lines, e.g. SN 1991T, 1998es, and 1999aa, the bulk
of their infrared Ca II feature appears to peak in strength
∼ 1-week after maximum light. This is still consistent with
a lack of strong signatures of HV Ca II near maximum light,
yet Silverman et al. (2015) ﬁnd favorable evidence for weak
absorption from Si II and Ca II at nominally high velocities
for some of these Shallow-Silicon events.

From a sample of 18 SN 1991bg-like events with cover-
age near maximum light, Silverman et al. (2015) conclude
models of SN 1991bg should never produce high velocity sig-
natures. However, this too remains uncertain given that the
only SN 1991bg-like event with a spectrum taken as early as
day −6 is SN 2005bl (Taubenberger et al. 2008; Hachinger
et al. 2009), and the normal SN Ia 2011fe eﬀectively lost
conspicuous signatures of highly blue-shifted absorption in
Ca II near day −10.

As for the positive correlation between the strength
of HV Ca II near maximum light and the width of the
light curve, there are SN Ia with broad light curves that
do not also have strong, high velocity features of Ca II, e.g.,
SN 2006gz, 2007if, and 2009dc (Silverman et al. 2015 and
references therein). Yet from our analysis of SN 2012dn, we
are still unable to directly rule out faint signatures of de-
tached Ca II from its spectra using the relatively stronger
H&K lines superimposed with Si II λ3858. Whether such a
detection is physically realizable underscores the need for re-
ﬁning parameter ranges for SYNAPPS-like tools by calibrating
to spectrum synthesizers that incorporate an approximated
abundance model, e.g., TARDIS (Kerzendorf & Sim 2014).

8 CONCLUSIONS

The time-series spectra we obtained of SN 2012dn during its
ﬁrst month showed an evolution most similar to SCC SN Ia,
but not as luminous as one might expect (Brown et al. 2014;
Chakradhari et al. 2014). In particular, the weaker than nor-
mal signatures of Si II and Ca II, a stronger than normal

signature of C II λ6580, and relatively slowly evolving line-
velocities indicate that SN 2012dn is most closely associated
with the SCC class of SN Ia. Late-time comparisons to SCC
SN Ia also support an association between this particular
subclass and SN 2012dn (see Chakradhari et al. 2014 and
our Figure 4).

The 11-component prescription of ions utilized here for
deconstructing the photospheric phase spectra of SN 2012dn
(Figures 5−10) aﬀorded us an ability to provide internally
consistent inferences of multiple line-velocities (Figure 13),
and can be improved upon (Parrent 2014). Compared to
signatures of C II observed for the normal SN 2011fe, for
SN 2012dn we estimate the material associated with C II is
only ∼ 2000 km s−1 slower. As was similarly proposed for
SN 2006bt (Foley et al. 2010b), Chakradhari et al. (2014)
ﬁnd the discordant velocity estimates of C II and Si II may
indicate that the carbon-rich material is clumpy and oﬀ-
center from the line-of-sight. Whether or not this is the case
awaits a larger sample of SN 2012dn-like events. Addition-
ally, and unlike other so-called “Shallow Silicon” events such
as SN 1991T, 1997br, and 1999aa, we ﬁnd little evidence fa-
voring a detection of C III λ4649 in the early phase spectra
of SN 2012dn.

An important take away point from our analysis of
SN 2012dn spectra in §6 and visual classiﬁcation of PTF
SN Ia in §7 is that a majority of SN spectral features are
not caused by some underlying stochastic variation. Rather,
signatures of atomic species form a highly blended spectrum
that nature is frequently capable of reproducing, such that
we have a few distinct SN Ia subtypes and a number of out-
liers that suggest a continuum. Yet a cross examination of
spectra computed for super-MCh merging WDs (e.g., Pak-
mor et al. 2012; Moll et al. 2014; Raskin et al. 2014) reveals
that, while these spectra resemble SN Ia-like events, they are
not well-matched to observations of super-MCh candidates
SN 2006gz and 2012dn, nor have they been shown to con-
sistently predict the spectroscopic evolution of more normal
SN Ia.

Namely, Moll et al. (2014) and Raskin et al. (2014) ﬁnd
line velocities that are too high for both normal SN Ia and
events similar to SN 2012dn (upwards of 20,000 km s−1 near
maximum light, and depending on the viewing-angle). Sim-
ilarly, the maximum-light spectrum for the violent merger
provided by Pakmor et al. (2012) has the appearance of pre-
dicting signatures of iron that are too strong compared to
normal SN Ia, whereas signatures of intermediate-mass ele-
ments do not appear strong enough. Given that signatures
of iron-peak and intermediate-mass elements in SN 2006gz
and 2012dn are somewhat weaker than normal, and there-
fore weaker than some of the latest predictions of merging
WDs, we are therefore unable to relate these progenitor sce-
narios in their current form to SN 2012dn.

In an attempt to diﬀerentiate a progenitor channel
through other means, in §7 we examined the PTF sample
used by Pan et al. (2014) who studied correlations between
properties of the host galaxy and light curve parameters of
82 SN Ia. However, in §7.2.2 we found that empirical mea-
sures such as light curve width, or stretch, do not encom-
pass the spectroscopic details for a given sample of SN Ia
(see Figures 14 and 15), nor has the negative correlation be-
tween light curve stretch and host-galaxy mass been shown

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–24

to apply to all types of peculiar and more normal SN Ia
within a given sample.

Current models of both single-degenerate delayed det-
onations (Kasen & Plewa 2007) and select WD mergers
(Pakmor et al. 2012; Raskin et al. 2014; Dan et al. 2015)
may account for multiple SN Ia subtypes as the distri-
bution of ejected material is found to be asymmetric in
some instances. Therefore, to investigate and clarify the
relationships between spectroscopic diversity, properties of
the host environment, and lifetimes of the progenitors,
photometrically-based SN surveys would beneﬁt from en-
hanced spectroscopic monitoring of nearby supernovae, in-
cluding events at redshifts greater than unity.
