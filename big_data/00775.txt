THE ZIEGLER SPECTRUM FOR DERIVED-DISCRETE ALGEBRAS

KRISTIN KROGH ARNESEN, ROSANNA LAKING, DAVID PAUKSZTELLO, AND MIKE PREST

Abstract. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. We show that the Krull-Gabriel di-
mension of the homotopy category of projective Λ-modules, and therefore the Cantor-
Bendixson rank of its Ziegler spectrum, is 2, thus extending a result of Bobi´nski and
Krause [9]. We also describe all the indecomposable pure-injective complexes and hence
the Ziegler spectrum for derived-discrete algebras, extending a result of Z. Han [16].
Using this, we are able to prove that all indecomposable complexes in the homotopy
category of projective Λ-modules are pure-injective, so obtaining a class of algebras
for which every indecomposable complex is pure-injective but which are not derived
pure-semisimple.

Introduction

We prove that if Λ is a derived-discrete algebra then the Krull-Gabriel dimension of
the homotopy category, K(Proj-Λ), of projective modules is 2, which is therefore also the
Cantor-Bendixson rank of the Ziegler spectrum of K(Proj-Λ). This extends a result of
Bobi´nski and Krause who computed this dimension for the derived category. We also
show that every indecomposable complex of K(Proj-Λ) is a homotopy string complex,
in particular is pure-injective and hence a point of the Ziegler spectrum, which we also
describe. Our proof that there are no further indecomposable objects relies heavily on
that description.

The axioms of triangulated categories are an abstraction of the structural properties
enjoyed by derived categories in representation theory and algebraic geometry, and sta-
ble homotopy categories in algebraic topology. Thus, triangulated categories provide a
common language for a broad part of modern mathematics.
In representation theory
triangulated categories play a central role in tilting theory, which is a technique to enable
eﬀective comparisons between the representation theory of diﬀerent algebras.

Whilst useful, triangulated categories often have complicated structure. One can gain
some understanding by studying various aspects. For example, one may try to classify
the thick or localising subcategories.
In this article we focus on another method of
simpliﬁcation: identifying the indecomposable pure-injective objects and the space, the
Ziegler spectrum, originally arising from the model theory of modules, that they form.
Methods involving purity and the Ziegler spectrum were extended to compactly generated
triangulated categories by Beligiannis, Krause and others; see for example [4, 5, 20, 23]
and the references therein.

Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category (see Section 1). We shall fo-
cus on three essentially equivalent approaches to studying the structure of T; namely
understanding the objects in the following diagram.

Deﬁnable subcategories

D ∩ Zg(T) of Zg(T)

of Ab(T)op := ((Tc)op, Ab)fp

is a topological space whose points are the
Here Zg(T), the Ziegler spectrum of T,
(isomorphism classes of) indecomposable pure-injective objects of T, and Ab(T)op :=
((Tc)op, Ab)fp is the category of ﬁnitely presented contravariant functors from the sub-
category Tc of compact objects, to abelian groups; this may be regarded as an abelian
approximation of T. We refer to Section 1 for precise deﬁnitions of the concepts involved
in the diagram above.

Associated to a topological space is its Cantor-Bendixson rank and associated to an
abelian category is its Krull-Gabriel dimension. Applied to Zg(T) and Ab(T)op, each
of these may be regarded as a measure of the complexity of the triangulated category
T. Under suitable conditions, the process of computing the Cantor-Bendixson rank of
Zg(T) and the Krull-Gabriel dimension of Ab(T)op proceed in tandem. Indeed, there is a
strong link between the two computations. In this article, we shall use this link to study
the homotopy category of projective left Λ-modules K(Proj-Λ) for Λ a derived-discrete
algebra.

Derived-discrete algebras were introduced by Vossieck in [31] and occupy a position
between ﬁnite and tame representation type: Λ is derived-discrete if and only if up to
shift there are inﬁnitely many indecomposable objects in Db(mod-Λ) but there are no
1-parameter families; see [31, §1.1]. It was shown in [31] that Λ is derived-discrete if and
only if it is piecewise hereditary of Dynkin type or a gentle one-cycle algebra satisfying
a certain condition on its quiver. From now on when we refer to Λ as a derived-discrete
algebra we shall exclude the case that Λ is piecewise hereditary of Dynkin type since
these categories are very well understood. The philosophy behind studying derived-
discrete algebras is that they provide a natural laboratory of computationally feasible
but nontrivial derived categories in which to explore derived representation theory, and
they provide a template for further study of derived categories of gentle algebras, these
being important in cluster-tilting theory. As such, they have been the focus of much
recent interest [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 29, 31].

From now on Λ will be a derived-discrete algebra over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k.

Our ﬁrst main result refers to the bottom vertices of the diagram above:

Theorem A. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then KGdim(K(Proj-Λ)) = 2, which
is also the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the Ziegler spectrum of K(Proj-Λ).

This extends the result of Bobi´nski and Krause in [9], who compute the Krull-Gabriel
dimension of the abelianisation of the perfect complexes Ab(D(Mod-Λ))op, getting

KGdim(D(Mod-Λ)) = 1 if gldim Λ = ∞ and KGdim(D(Mod-Λ)) = 2 if gldim Λ < ∞.

We then use the correspondences in the diagram to obtain a description of the points

of the Ziegler spectrum and its topology.

The indecomposable objects of Db(mod-Λ) were classiﬁed in [8] and the morphisms
studied in [10]. This ﬁts inside a more general classiﬁcation, due to Bekkert and Merklen
[3], of indecomposable complexes in the bounded derived category of a gentle algebra and
a more general description, in [1], of morphisms between the indecomposable complexes.
We build on these results, describing all the indecomposable complexes of K(Proj-Λ). We
show that every indecomposable is pure-injective, hence a point of the Ziegler spectrum
of K(Proj-Λ).

Theorem B. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then each indecomposable complex in
K(Proj-Λ) is both:

(1) a (possibly inﬁnite) homotopy string complex;
(2) pure-injective.

Moreover, the homotopy string complexes, of which we have a complete list, are all the
indecomposable pure-injective objects of K(Proj-Λ).

We also describe the Cantor-Bendixson stratiﬁcation of the Ziegler spectrum, identify-
ing the simple functors and the corresponding points relatively isolated by them. In the
case of the derived-discrete algebras Λ(n, n, 0), n ≥ 1 the Ziegler spectrum had already
been described by Z. Han [16] using covering theory. Our methods are very diﬀerent,
replying heavily on the description of morphisms in [1] and techniques around the Ziegler
spectrum and the functor category. We will require ideas and results coming from various
directions; some we summarise and for all we give references to where the details can be
found.

In Section 1 we describe purity in a compactly generated triangulated category T. We
then go on to deﬁne the Ziegler spectrum, Zg(T), of T, both internally and through the
restricted Yoneda functor to the functor category on the compact objects of T. We also
describe the corresponding two, anti-equivalent, categories of coherent functors. Local-
isation of abelian categories, Krull-Gabriel dimension, Cantor-Bendixson rank and the
relations between these are brieﬂy recalled in Section 2.

Section 3 reviews what we need on (homotopy) string complexes and the morphisms
between them. In particular, we describe the structure of the Auslander–Reiten quiver
of the string complexes and determine the Hom-hammocks of each string complex.

In Section 4 we consider the triangulated category K(Proj-Λ) where Λ is a derived-
discrete algebra. We ﬁrst show that the Krull-Gabriel dimension is deﬁned, then de-
termine the simple functors in each quotient category obtained from the Krull-Gabriel
ﬁltration, and then identify the indecomposable complex relatively isolated by each such
functor.

By that point we have essentially complete information on the topology of the Ziegler
spectrum of K(Proj-Λ) and the remainder of the paper is devoted to showing that there
are no more indecomposable objects in K(Proj-Λ).

Our proof of that is structured around the Cantor-Bendixson analysis of the Ziegler
spectrum. After some preliminary results in Section 5, we treat the inﬁnite global di-
mension case in Section 6, this being simpliﬁed by there being unbounded, CB-rank 1,

3

compact objects. We have to work harder in the ﬁnite global dimension case, in Sec-
tion 7, where an analysis of the structure of the indecomposables of CB-rank 1 allows us
to complete the proof.

Convention. Throughout, Λ will be a derived-discrete algebra over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld k, which is not piecewise hereditary of Dynkin type. The homotopy category
of (not necessarily bounded) complexes of projective left Λ-modules will be denoted by
the shorthand K := K(Proj-Λ).

1. The Ziegler spectrum of a compactly generated triangulated

category

Throughout this section T will be a compactly generated triangulated category with
set-indexed coproducts; we shall denote the suspension functor by Σ : T → T. For the
convenience of the reader we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition here. A standard reference for
this material is [24].

An object C ∈ T is compact if, for every set {Di | i ∈ I} of objects in T, the canonical

morphism

HomT(C,Mi∈I

Di) →Mi∈I

HomT(C, Di)

is an isomorphism. We will denote the full (triangulated) subcategory of compact objects
in T by Tc. We say that T is compactly generated if Tc is skeletally small and, for every
object 0 6= D in T, there exists a nonzero morphism C → D for some C ∈ Tc.

1.1. Purity in a compactly generated triangulated category. Notions of purity
and the Ziegler spectrum were ﬁrst developed in the context of categories of modules.
They were extended to compactly generated triangulated categories T by various authors,
in particular in [20] (see also [4] and Neeman’s review [23] of [5] by Benson and Gnacadja).
For an overview of purity in compactly generated triangulated categories we refer to [27,
Ch. 17].

Consider the category of contravariant functors from Tc to the category Ab of abelian

groups:

Mod-Tc = ((Tc)

op

, Ab).

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let M, N be objects of T and f : M → N a morphism in T. The
restricted Yoneda functor Y : T → Mod-Tc is deﬁned by

N 7→ HomT(−, N)|Tc

and Y (f ) = HomT(−, f )|Tc.

Convention. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the shorthand (−, N) stands for the restricted
contravariant functor HomT(−, N)|Tc. However, the shorthand (N, −) will be used for
the unrestricted covariant functor HomT(N, −), except brieﬂy in Theorem 1.9 and Re-
mark 1.10. Similarly for the action on morphisms.

A monomorphism f : M → N in T is a pure-monomorphism if (−, f ) is a monomor-
phism in Mod-Tc. We will take the following equivalent statements as the deﬁnition of a
pure-injective object in T.

4

Proposition 1.2 ([20, §1.4]). Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category and
let N be an object of T. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(1) The functor (−, N) is an injective object of Mod-Tc.

(2) For every M ∈ T the induced morphism (M, N) → (cid:0)(−, M), (−, N)(cid:1) is an iso-

morphism.

(3) The object N is injective over all pure-monomorphisms. In other words, for every
pure-monomorphism g : L → M and every morphism f : L → N, there exists a
morphism h : M → N such that the following diagram commutes:

g
pure /

M

h

L

f

N

It then follows (see [20, Cor. 1.9]) that the restricted Yoneda functor induces an equiv-

alence of categories

Pinj(T) ≃ Inj(Mod-Tc).

where Pinj(T) is the full subcategory of pure-injective objects of T and Inj(Mod-Tc) is the
full subcategory of injective objects in Mod-Tc.

1.2. The Ziegler Spectrum of T. To deﬁne the compact open sets in the Ziegler
spectrum, we require the notion of coherent functors from T to Ab. A functor F : T → Ab
is coherent if there exists an exact sequence

(D, −) → (C, −) → F → 0

for some C, D ∈ Tc. The category of coherent functors from T to Ab will be denoted
Coh(T).

Deﬁnition 1.3. The Ziegler spectrum Zg(T) of T is a topological space whose points
are the isomorphism classes of indecomposable pure-injective objects in T. For each
F ∈ Coh(T), we deﬁne the set

(F ) := {N ∈ Zg(T) | F (N) 6= 0}.

These sets form a basis of (compact) open sets.

Deﬁnition 1.4. A full subcategory D of T is deﬁnable if it is of the form

D = {M ∈ T | Fi(M) = 0}

for some set {Fi | i ∈ I} of coherent functors.

For a collection of objects C ⊆ T the deﬁnable subcategory generated by C is

hCi := {M ∈ T | F ∈ Coh(T) and F (C) = 0 for all C ∈ C =⇒ F (M) = 0}.

In particular, a subcategory X is deﬁnable if and only if hX i = X .

In [21, Prop. 7.3] Krause shows that there is a natural bijection between the deﬁnable
subcategories of T and the closed subsets of Zg(T). As a result, each closed subset of
Zg(T) has the form D ∩ Zg(T) for some deﬁnable subcategory D of T.

1.3. The Ziegler spectrum of Mod-Tc. Since Mod-Tc is a locally ﬁnitely presented
abelian category we can make use of the corresponding deﬁnitions of purity, Ziegler
spectrum and deﬁnable subcategory. Although T is not locally ﬁnitely presented, nor
even necessarily ﬁnitely accessible, these deﬁnitions take exactly the same form for a
compactly generated triangulated category as they do in those other cases; so the reader
may obtain the corresponding deﬁnitions for Mod-Tc by replacing T by Mod-Tc and Tc
by mod-Tc, where the last is the full subcategory of ﬁnitely presented functors.

Deﬁnition 1.5. A functor F ∈ Mod-Tc is absolutely pure if every embedding F → G in
Mod-Tc is a pure-monomorphism. We say that F is fp-injective if it is injective over all
embeddings τ : G → H such that coker τ is ﬁnitely presented.

These two properties are well-known to be equivalent, see for example [27, Prop. 2.3.1].

Proposition 1.6. For F ∈ Mod-Tc, the following are equivalent

(1) F is absolutely pure;
(2) F is fp-injective;
(3) Ext1(G, F ) = 0 for each G ∈ mod-Tc.

Deﬁnition 1.5 and Proposition 1.6 work when Tc is replaced with any skeletally small
preadditive category but since we are considering a triangulated category we have the
following additional characterisation of absolutely pure objects, see [20, Lem. 2.7].

Proposition 1.7. A functor F ∈ Mod-Tc is absolutely pure if and only if it is ﬂat. In
particular, every absolutely pure functor F is a direct limit of representable functors.

We will denote the full subcategory of Mod-Tc consisting of the absolutely pure objects
by Abs-Tc. Because Mod-Tc is locally coherent, this is a deﬁnable subcategory (see [27,
Thm. 3.4.24]), so we let Zg(Abs-Tc) denote the closed subset Abs-Tc ∩ Zg(Mod-Tc) with
the topology induced from Zg(Mod-Tc).

1.4. The spaces Zg(T) and Zg(Abs-Tc) are homeomorphic. In order to prove the
main theorem of this section, we will need the following result.

Lemma 1.8 ([21, Lem. 7.2]). Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category. Then
there is an equivalence of categories

(mod-Tc)op ∼−→ Coh(T) given by F 7→ F ∨,

which is deﬁned on objects M ∈ T by F ∨(M) := (F, (−, M)).

Theorem 1.9. The assignment N 7→ (−, N) deﬁnes a homeomorphism between topolog-
ical spaces Zg(T) and Zg(Abs-Tc).

Proof. The points of Zg(Abs-Tc) are exactly the (isomorphism classes of) indecompos-
able injective objects in Mod-Tc. It therefore follows from the comment after Proposi-
tion 1.2 that the assignment N 7→ (−, N) is a bijection between the points of Zg(T) and
Zg(Abs-Tc). It remains to show that this bijection is a homeomorphism.

We consider the topology on Zg(Abs-Tc). The compact open sets of Zg(Abs-Tc) are,
as in Proposition 1.3, those of the form (G) where G is an object from a particular
localisation of (mod-Tc, Ab)fp which is a category of functors on Abs-Tc and which we
will denote by fun(Abs-Tc); see [27, §12.3], especially [27, Prop. 12.3.21], for details. It
is also the case that Abs-Tc is the category of exact functors on fun(Abs-Tc) and that
fun(Abs-Tc) is determined by Abs-Tc up to natural equivalence, see [27, §18.1.2]. So, by
[28, Prop. 7.2] we have that fun(Abs-Tc) ≃ (mod-Tc)op and this equivalence allows us to

6

describe the open sets of Zg(Abs-Tc) directly in terms of isomorphism classes of objects
from mod-Tc. One can also check that the equivalence (mod-Tc)op ≃ fun(Abs-Tc) takes an
object A ∈ (mod-Tc)(op) to the image of the representable functor (A, −) ∈ (mod-Tc, Ab)fp
in the localisation fun(Abs-Tc) (this follows from the comments before [28, Prop. 7.1] and
the fact that (A, −) is the dual of the functor A ⊗Tc −). It follows that the compact open
sets are those of the form

(A) = {(−, N) ∈ Zg(Abs-Tc) | (A, (−, N)) 6= 0}

for A ∈ mod-Tc.

The equivalence in Lemma 1.8 gives us that, for each F ∈ Coh(T), there exists some

A ∈ mod-Tc such that A∨ = F and the corresponding compact open set in Zg(T) is

(F ) := {N ∈ Zg(T) | F (N) 6= 0} = {N ∈ Zg(T) | (A, (−, N)) 6= 0}.

Thus N 7→ (−, N) deﬁnes a homeomorphism and we complete the proof.

(cid:3)

F , of any functor F ∈
Remark 1.10. We recall how to deﬁne the unique extension,
(mod-Tc, Ab)fp to a functor from Mod-Tc to Ab that commutes with direct limits. Let
M ∈ Mod-Tc, then M can be written as a direct limit M = lim−→ Mλ with Mλ ∈ mod-Tc.
Then

−→
F (M) := lim−→ F (Mλ).

In order to deﬁne the sets (A) as above, one should note that the extension of (A, −)
from a functor on mod-Tc to one on Mod-Tc is still, since A is ﬁnitely presented, the
functor (A, −).

Recall that a typical object G in Coh(T) has a presentation (D, −) → (C, −) → G → 0
where C, D ∈ Tc. Since the Yoneda functor is full, there must be some f : C → D
such that G = coker(f, −); then we will denote G by Ff . It will be useful to be able to
explicitly describe the form of F ∈ mod-Tc when F ∨ = Ff .

Corollary 1.11. Consider the equivalence of Lemma 1.8 above. Suppose F ∨ = Ff for
some f : C → D in Tc. Then F is the kernel of the image of f under the restricted
Yoneda functor, i.e. there is an exact sequence

0 −→ F −→ (−, C)

(−,f )
−→ (−, D).

In particular, every ﬁnitely presented Tc-module is the kernel of a morphism between
ﬁnitely generated projective Tc-modules.

Proof. Suppose, under the equivalence of Lemma 1.8, F ∨ = Ff for some f : C → D in Tc.
Note that (−, D)∨ = (D, −) whenever D is a compact object since ((−, D), (−, M)) ∼=
(D, M) for any M in T. We can rewrite the exact sequence
−→ (C, −) −→ Ff −→ 0 as (−, D)∨ (−,f )∨

−→ (−, C)∨ −→ F ∨ −→ 0

(f,−)

(D, −)

and so 0 −→ F −→ (−, C)

(−,f )
−→ (−, D) is also exact.

2. Cantor-Bendixson rank and Krull-Gabriel dimension

2.1. Cantor-Bendixson rank of a topological space. The following material is clas-
sical; see, for example, [27, §5.3.6]. Let T be a topological space, for instance Zg(T).
A point p ∈ T is isolated if {p} is an open set and such points are assigned Cantor-
Bendixson rank (or CB-rank ) 0. The ﬁrst Cantor-Bendixson derivative T ′ of T is the

7

closed subset of T containing all the non-isolated points of T . With respect to the rela-
tive topology, T ′ itself may have isolated points, which are said to have CB rank 1. One
continues this process inductively to obtain points of CB rank n for any n ∈ N and we
write T (n) = (T (n−1))′, with T = T (0). If at some point T (n+1) = ∅ but T (n) 6= ∅ then we
say that T has CB rank n.

Remark 2.1. The process above can be continued transﬁnitely. Since the topological
spaces we consider turn out to have ﬁnite CB rank, we ignore this.

2.2. Localisation at Serre subcategories. A full subcategory S of an abelian category
C is a Serre subcategory if, for every exact sequence 0 → A → B → C → 0 in C, we have
A, C ∈ S if and only if B ∈ S.

For a Serre subcategory S ⊆ C, the quotient category C/S has the same objects as C

and morphisms are given by

HomC/S(A, B) :=

lim−→

A/A′∈S,B′∈S

HomC(A′, B/B′).

2.3. Localisation with respect to hereditary torsion theories. For background on
(hereditary) torsion theories and localisation with respect to torsion classes we refer the
reader to [30, Ch. VI]; see also [27, Ch. 11]. We remind the reader of some key points
that we will need here.

Let C be a Grothendieck abelian category. A torsion class A is a full subcategory C
that is closed under quotients, extensions, direct sums and summands; objects of A are
said to be torsion. A torsion class is hereditary if it is also closed under subobjects. It
determines a torsion pair (A, B), where B = A⊥ := {B ∈ C | Hom(A, B) = 0}. An object
of B is said to be torsionfree. A torsion class comes equipped with a subfunctor t of the
identity functor on C which sends an object C to t(C), the largest torsion subobject of
C. If the functor t commutes with direct limits, (A, B) is said to be of ﬁnite type.

A hereditary torsion theory determines a localisation functor, q : C → C/A, which may

be deﬁned as in the subsection above or (on objects) by
C 7→ π−1(t(E(C ′)/C ′)),

where C ′ := C/tC, E(C ′) is the injective hull of C ′ and π = coker(C ′ ֒→ E(C ′)). The
localisation functor q enjoys the following properties:

(1) q is left adjoint to the canonical embedding i : C/A → C;
(2) if E is a torsionfree injective object then E ∼= i ◦ q(E).
Since Mod-Tc is locally coherent, mod-Tc is abelian and the lim−→-closure of each Serre

subcategory of mod-Tc is a hereditary ﬁnite-type torsion class.

2.4. Localisation with respect to deﬁnable subcategories. We refer to [27, §12.3,
§12.4] for details of the following.

We saw in the proof of Theorem 1.9 that fun(Abs-Tc) ≃ (mod-Tc)op. It follows that

each deﬁnable subcategory D of Abs-Tc is determined by the Serre subcategory

S(D) := {F ∈ mod-Tc | (F, D) = 0 for all D ∈ D}

of mod-Tc which then generates a hereditary, ﬁnite-type, torsion subclass in Mod-Tc

A(D) = {A ∈ Mod-Tc | (A, D) = 0 for all D ∈ D}.

We shall denote the corresponding localisation of Mod-Tc by (Mod-Tc)D.

By [27, Prop. 11.1.29], the torsion theory (A(D), B(D)) is cogenerated by its inde-
composable torsionfree injective objects, i.e. the set X := D ∩ Zg(Abs-Tc), which is a

8

closed subset of Zg(Abs-Tc). By abuse of notation we shall often write (Mod-Tc)X for the
localisation (Mod-Tc)D.

The category of ﬁnitely presented objects in (Mod-Tc)D and the quotient of mod-Tc by
S(D) coincide ([27, Cor. 11.1.34]). Again, by abuse of notation we denote this localisation
by (mod-Tc)D or (mod-Tc)X. Since Coh(T) ≃ (mod-Tc)op by Lemma 1.8, we use similar
notation for the corresponding localisations of Coh(T).

Given the homeomorphism Zg(T) ∼= Zg(Abs-Tc) of Theorem 1.9, there are parallel
deﬁnitions and notations for localisations of Coh(T) at deﬁnable subcategories D of T
and closed subsets X ⊆ Zg(T).

2.5. Krull-Gabriel dimension. Recall from [14, Def. 2.1] that a Krull-Gabriel ﬁltration
of a (skeletally) small abelian category C consists of a properly increasing ﬁltration by
Serre subcategories

0 = C−1 ⊆ C0 ⊆ C1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Cn = C,

where, for each i, Ci/Ci−1 is the full subcategory of all objects of ﬁnite length in C/Ci−1. If
there is such a ﬁltration then the Krull-Gabriel dimension (or KG-dimension), KGdim(C),
of C is, n. For each i, we denote the localisation functor by qi : C → C/Ci.

By abuse of notation, in the case of a compactly generated triangulated category T we

shall write KGdim(T) for KGdim(Coh(T)) and call it the KG-dimension of T.

Remark 2.2. More generally, ordinal-indexed Krull-Gabriel ﬁltrations may be considered
giving, as with CB-rank, an ordinal-valued KG-dimension. In the case that there is no
such ﬁltration, the KG-dimension is undeﬁned.

Let L be a modular lattice and let L′ be the quotient modular lattice obtained by
collapsing all ﬁnite length intervals in L. Starting with L−1 := L and deﬁning Ln =
(Ln−1)′ for n ∈ N, we deﬁne the m-dimension of L to be the least n such that Ln = 0.
We recall the following lemma, see for example [18, Lem. 1.1], where LC(X) denotes the
lattice of subobjects of an object X of an abelian category C.

Lemma 2.3. Let C be an abelian category and X ∈ C an object. Then qi induces a
natural isomorphism LC(X)i

∼= LC/Ci(qiX) for all i.

Remark 2.4. We highlight the following consequences of Lemma 2.3.

(1) For X 6= 0 the m-dimension of LC(X) is n if and only if qn−1(X) 6= 0 and has

ﬁnite length in C/Cn.

(2) The Krull-Gabriel dimension of C is deﬁned if and only if for each X ∈ C no
subset of the lattice LC(X) forms a densely ordered chain (see, for example, [27,
Prop. 7.2.3, Prop. 13.2.1]).

Deﬁnition 2.5. The Ziegler spectrum of T satisﬁes the isolation condition if for every
closed subset X ⊆ Zg(T) and every point M ∈ X isolated in the relative topology on X,
there is a coherent functor F such that (F ) ∩ X = {M} and such that the image of F is
simple in the localisation Coh(T)X.

We have the following link between KG-dimension and the isolation condition, which

we follow with the link between the CB-rank and KG-dimension.

Lemma 2.6 ([32, Lem. 8.11]). For a compactly generated triangulated category T, if
KGdim(T) is deﬁned, then Zg(T) satisﬁes the isolation condition.

Proposition 2.7 ([32, Thm. 8.6], see also [26, Prop. 10.19]). Suppose Zg(T) satisﬁes the
isolation condition. Then:

9

(1) Coh(T)/Coh(T)i = Coh(T)Xi, where Xi is the closed subset of Zg(T) containing

the points of CB-rank ≥ i;

(2) there is a bijection between points N of CB-rank i and simple functors F in

Coh(T)Xi given by (F ′) ∩ Xi = {N} where F ′ ∈ Coh(T) is such that qiF ′ = F .

Here we are using the homeomorphism of Theorem 1.9 and the fact that the original
result, proved for modules over rings, holds equally true for modules over small preadditive
categories (the development of the theory in [27] accommodates this level of generality).

Corollary 2.8. Suppose T is a compactly generated triangulated category. For an object
M of T we have

CB-rank M in Zg(T) = CB-rank(−, M) in Zg(Abs-Tc).

If Zg(T) satisﬁes the isolation condition then KGdim(T) = CB-rank Zg(T).

Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 1.9 and Proposition 2.7.

3. The structure of K(Proj-Λ) for derived-discrete algebras

Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. In [8, Thm. A], Bobi´nski, Geiß and Skowro´nski
obtained a canonical representative Λ(r, n, m), with 1 ≤ r ≤ n and m ≥ 0, given by the
bound quiver below, for each derived-equivalence class of derived-discrete algebra.

In [8, Thm. B], the authors then used the triple (r, n, m) to describe the structure of
the Auslander–Reiten (AR) quiver of Db(mod-Λ(r, n, m)). Thus, from now on, we shall
identify each derived-discrete algebra, Λ, with its representative Λ(r, n, m) in the derived
equivalence class and use this algebra to describe the structure of K(Proj-Λ).

3.1. String complexes. Since Λ is a gentle algebra the indecomposable complexes of
Db(mod-Λ) ≃ K−,b(proj-Λ) can be described in terms of so-called (homotopy) string com-
plexes; [3] (also [12]), and [6] for the terminology. In this section we describe a generalisa-
tion to string complexes with possibly unbounded (but still degreewise ﬁnite-dimensional)
cohomology. We refer to [1, §2] for a summary of [3] using the terminology and notation
of this article.

Remark 3.1. The main theorem of [3] asserts that the indecomposable complexes of
Db(mod-Λ) are precisely the isoclasses of string and band complexes. However, the ab-
sence of band complexes is precisely the reason for discreteness, and we therefore make
no further reference to band complexes.

We begin with a description of the string complexes in K(Proj-Λ), which is an extension
of [1, Lem. 7.1]; see also [15, Lem. 3]. The proof of the following lemma is a straightforward
exercise in the combinatorics of the quiver of Λ(r, n, m).

The passage from a homotopy string w to the corresponding string complex Pw is ﬁrst

described in [3, 6]. We follow the notation in [1, §2].

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let Pw be a string complex for Λ = Λ(r, n, m). We say that Pw is
perfect: if it is any shift of a string complex of a subword of wℓ for ℓ ≥ 0;
left-inﬁnite: if it is any shift of a string complex of a left-inﬁnite subword of ∞w;
right-inﬁnite: if it is any shift of a string complex of a right-inﬁnite subword of w∞;
one-sided : if it is left- or right-inﬁnite;
two-sided : if it is any shift of the string complex ∞w∞.
We shall denote the set of all string complexes of Λ by Str-Λ.

We have the following global statement regarding the dimensions of Hom-spaces be-

tween string complexes; cf. [10, Thm .5.1] and [1, Thm. 7.4].

Proposition 3.4. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then, for A, B ∈ Str-Λ, we have

dim HomK(A, B) ≤(cid:26) 1

2

for r > 1,
for r = 1.

Moreover, if one of A, B ∈ Str-Λ is nonperfect then dim HomK(A, B) ≤ 1.

Proof. For this we apply [1, Thm. 3.15] using arguments analogous to those in [1, §7]. (cid:3)

To see which string complexes admit 2-dimensional Hom-spaces between them, we refer

to [10, Prop. 5.2].

Corollary 3.5. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then the objects of Str-Λ are inde-
composable.

Proof. The perfect string complexes are known to be indecomposable by [3]. For any
other string complex A we have HomK(A, A) = k, whence the idempotent-completeness
of K gives the indecomposability.
(cid:3)

3.2. Compact objects of K. To show that string complexes are pure-injective, we ﬁrst
need to identify the compact objects of K. This is a special case of a construction of
Jørgensen [17]; see also [25] for a strengthening of this result.

Proposition 3.6. Let Λ = Λ(r, n, m) be a derived-discrete algebra. An indecomposable
complex in K is compact if and only if it is a right-inﬁnite string complex.

Proof. We follow Jørgensen’s construction from [17]. Write (−)∗ = HomΛ(−, Λ) for the
standard duality with respect to Λ. If M is a ﬁnite-dimensional left Λ-module then M ∗ is
a ﬁnite-dimensional right Λ-module. Let PM be a projective resolution of M ∗. Note that
PM ∈ K−,b(proj-Λop) and is quasi-isomorphic to M ∗ in Db(mod-Λop). We also consider
the complex P ∗
M depend functorially on
M in K−,b(proj-Λop) and K−,b(proj-Λ), respectively; see [17, Construction 1.2].

M ∈ K−,b(proj-Λ), and note that both PM and P ∗

Let G := {ΣiP ∗

M | M ∈ mod-Λ, i ∈ Z}. [17, Thm. 2.4] asserts that G is a set of compact
generators for K. Now consider the following two subcategories of K and K(Proj-Λop),
where the notation indicates the thick subcategory generated by a set of objects:

C := thickK(G) and D := thickK(Proj-Λop)(G∗ | G ∈ G).

Note that C = Kc, since G is a set of compact generators [22, Thm. 2.1.3]. Now, the proof
of [17, Thm. 3.2] asserts that

C

(−)∗

(−)∗

/ D

are quasi-inverse equivalences between triangulated categories.
Thm. 3.2] it is shown that

In the proof of [17,

D = thickK(Proj-Λop)(PN | PN is a projective resolution of some N ∈ mod-Λop).

In particular, this means that D = K−,b(proj-Λop), the indecomposable complexes of
which are precisely the left-inﬁnite string complexes in Str-Λop. For Λ derived-discrete,
the image of the set of left-inﬁnite string complexes in Str-Λop under the equivalence
(−)∗ is precisely the set of right-inﬁnite string complexes in Str-Λ. Thus the right-inﬁnite
string complexes are precisely the indecomposable compact complexes of K.
(cid:3)

Recall from [13, 19] that an object N of a general compactly generated triangulated
category is endoﬁnite if for each C ∈ Tc the EndT(N)-module HomT(C, N) is of ﬁnite
length.

Lemma 3.7 ([19, Thm. 1.2]). An endoﬁnite object of a compactly generated triangulated
category is pure-injective.

Putting Propositions 3.4, 3.6 and Corollary 3.5 together with Lemma 3.7 gives:

Corollary 3.8. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then any string complex is endoﬁnite
and hence is an indecomposable pure-injective object of K.

We now know that the objects of Str-Λ are indecomposable pure-injective objects of K.
In Section 4 we shall see that Str-Λ is a complete list of indecomposable pure-injective
objects of K. However, in order to do this we need to describe the ‘AR quiver’ of the
additive category add(Str-Λ) and the shapes of the Hom-hammocks, which we do in the
next subsections.

3.3. The AR quiver of Str-Λ for Λ of ﬁnite global dimension. The AR quiver of
Str-Λ is computed by a straightforward calculation using Bob´ınski’s algorithm [6] (also,
[1, §6] avoiding the Happel functor and including pictures). It has 8r components: 3r
components sit in Kb(proj-Λ), for which we keep the notation and co-ordinate system of [8].
In particular, the components are denoted X 0, . . . , X r−1, Y 0, . . . , Y r−1, and Z 0, . . . , Z r−1.
The components X k and Y k are of type ZA∞. The components Z k are of type ZA∞
∞. For
each k = 0, . . . , r − 1, we label the indecomposable objects of X k, Y k and Z k as follows:
ij ∈ Z k with i, j ∈ Z.

ij ∈ Y k with i, j ∈ Z, j ≤ i; Z k

1−1←→ {two-sided string complexes}.

Moreover, in light of Proposition 3.6, when gldim Λ < ∞ the compact indecomposable
complexes in K are precisely those lying in X , Y and Z components of Str-Λ.

3.4. The AR quiver of Str-Λ for Λ of inﬁnite global dimension. The AR quiver of
Db(mod-Λ) ≃ K−,b(proj-Λ) ⊂ Str-Λ has 2r components consisting of r components of type
ZA∞ denoted by X 0, . . . , X r−1 and r components of type A∞
∞ denoted by Z 0, . . . , Z r−1.
The full subcategory of perfect complexes Kb(proj-Λ) = add(X ). We sketch the structure
of K−,b(proj-Λ) in Figure 2; the co-ordinate system is that of [8]. For each k = 0, . . . , r = n,
we label the indecomposable objects of X k and Z k as follows:

Moreover, in light of Proposition 3.6, when gldim Λ = ∞ the compact indecomposable
complexes in K are those lying in X components and the ‘righthand beam’ of each of the

eZ ‘ladder’ components, i.e. the objects Z k

i for i ∈ Z and 0 ≤ k < r, in Str-Λ.

hammocks

H+(A) := {X ∈ ind(K−,b(proj-Λ)) | HomK(A, X) 6= 0}
H−(A) := {X ∈ ind(K−,b(proj-Λ)) | HomK(X, A) 6= 0}.

∞(A) := {X ∈ Str-Λ | HomK(A, X) 6= 0} the forward Hom-hammock of A;

3.6. Hom-hammocks in Str-Λ for Λ of ﬁnite global dimension. We introduce the
following notation to encode the action of the suspension on indecomposable objects.

Notation 3.11. For a ∈ Z we set

otherwise,

The following proposition will be more easily understood by looking at Figure 1 and

natural extensions of the ﬁgures in [10, §2].

The Hom-hammocks involving only perfect string complexes were established in [10, §2
& §5]; we extend these to left- and right-inﬁnite and two-sided string complexes here. We
start by extending the ‘extended rays’ and ‘extended corays’ of [10, Properties 1.2(5)].

The sequences in Lemma 3.13 whose leftmost parts consist of objects of X ∪ X−∞ will
be called extended rays in Str-Λ and those whose leftmost parts consist of objects of
Y ∪ Y−∞ will be called extended corays.

Proof. This is an exercise in homotopy string combinatorics using Bobi´nski’s algorithm
from [6] or [1, §6] and the description of morphisms between string complexes given in [1,
Thm. 3.15], cf. [1, §7] for a more concrete description in this setting, and [10, Appendix
B] using classical string combinatorics.
(cid:3)

We now identify some distinguished triangles in K involving objects of Str-Λ analogous

to those in [10, Properties 1.2(4)].

Lemma 3.14. Let a, b ∈ Z. The following are distinguished triangles in K:

X k

a,a → X k
Y k
a,a → Y k

a,∞ → X k
∞,a → Y k

Proof. From the form of the homotopy strings in Lemma 3.2, and therefore the straight-
forward form of the corresponding string complexes, the mapping cones of the morphisms
in Lemma 3.13 is a standard computation.
(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove Proposition 3.12. The arguments are in the spirit of [10,

§2] so we just give a sketch.

Proof of Proposition 3.12. Let A and B be string complexes. We split the argument up
into diﬀerent cases.
Case A ∈ ind(X ∪ Y) and B ∈ Str-Λ: In fact, we consider only the case A ∈ ind(X ); the
case A ∈ ind(Y) is analogous. Suppose A = X k
a,b. We ﬁrst deal with the non-vanishing
statements. If B is a perfect string complex then this is [10, Prop. 2.4], so we assume
that B ∈ ind(X k
a,b, h(A) = b − a, then
gives the desired conclusion. Use Lemma 3.13 for the base step. For the inductive step,
apply HomK(−, X k

from the resulting long exact sequences. The only subtlety is when r = 1 and ΣB =
ΣXi,∞ = Xb,∞ (the superscripts are dropped because r = 1). In this case i = b−1−m and
we cannot infer that HomK(Σ−1A0, B) = HomK(Σ−1Xb,b, Xb−1−m,∞) = 0. However, by

analogue of Proposition 3.12 for Λ of inﬁnite global dimension. The proof is analogous
to that for Proposition 3.12 and is therefore omitted. The statement is more easily
understood with reference to a ﬁgure, the relevant illustrations are Figures 2 and 3.

3.8. Factorisation properties. Finally, in order to determine how the simple functors
isolate indecomposable pure-injective objects in the next section, we need to understand
how morphisms factor in Str-Λ.

Proposition 3.16. Let A, B, C ∈ Str-Λ. If B ∈ H+
any map f : A → C factors as A → B → C.

∞(A) and C ∈ H+

∞(A) ∩ H+

∞(B) then

∞(A)∩H−

∞(A) ∩ H−

−∞ is analogous. There exist B′ ∈ ind(X k)∩H+

Proof. If A, B, C ∈ ind(K−,b(proj-Λ)) then this statement can be deduced from [10, §2] or
[9, §4]. If A, B and C lie on the same extended ray or coray, then this is Lemma 3.13.
The rest of the proof splits up into a case analysis building up from these rays and corays.
Case 1: A ∈ ind(X ∪ Y). We assume A ∈ ind(X k) for some 0 ≤ k < r; the case
A ∈ ind(Y k) is analogous. Suppose C ∈ ind(Z k ∪ X k+1). We verify the factorisation for
∞; the check for B ∈ X k+1
B ∈ X k
∞(C)
and C ′ ∈ ind(Z k ∪ X k+1) ∩ H+
∞(C) such that B′, B and C ′ lie on the same
extended ray or coray. The map A → C thus factors as A → B′ → C ′ → C by the
factorisation statements for maps between indecomposable perfect complexes. However,
by Lemma 3.13, the map B′ → C ′ factors as B′ → B → C ′ giving the desired statement.
If B, C ∈ ind(X k
Case 2: A ∈ ind(Z).
If C ∈ ind(X ∪ Y) then this is the dual to Case 1. Assume
A ∈ ind(Z k). We only need to check the case that C ∈ ind(Z k+1) (the other cases are
covered by Cases 3 and 4 and their duals). Suppose B ∈ ind(X k+1
−∞ ). Then there exists
B′ ∈ ind(X k+1) ∩ H+
∞(C). In particular, the map A → C factorises as
A → B′ → C and by above the map A → B′ factorises as A → B → B′, as required.
Case 3: A ∈ ind(X±∞ ∪ Y±∞). We treat the case A ∈ X k
∞; the other cases are analogous.
For B and C lying on the same extended ray or coray, this is again Lemma 3.13, so
assume B and C lie on a diﬀerent extended ray or coray from A. We ﬁrst cover the case

that B ∈ ind(X k

4. Krull-Gabriel dimension and simple functors

The Krull-Gabriel dimension of D(Mod-Λ), that is, of Coh(D(Mod-Λ)), was computed
in [9]. In this section we follow the approach of [9] to compute the Krull-Gabriel dimension
of Coh(K) and to identify the simple functors in Coh(K)/Coh(K)n for each n ∈ N. The
main result of this section is the following, where the ﬁrst statement is Theorem A and the
second statement is part of Theorem B. Note the contrast with KGdim(D(Mod-Λ)) = 1
in the inﬁnite global dimension case in [9].

Theorem 4.1. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then

(1) KGdim(K(Proj-Λ)) = CB-rank(K) = 2.
(2) The objects of Str-Λ form a complete list of indecomposable, pure-injective com-

plexes in K.

Using the same argument as [27, Lem. 10.2.2], we have the following useful character-

isation of coherent subfunctors of Ff .

Lemma 4.2. Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category and let Ff be a coherent
functor. Then, all coherent subfunctors of Ff have the form im(h, −)/ im(f, −) for some
factorisation f = gh of f in Tc.

Lemma 4.3. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra. Then KGdim(K) is deﬁned.

Proof. Let F ∈ Coh(K) and consider the lattice L(F ) of coherent subfunctors of F . By
Lemma 4.2 and the descriptions of the Hom-hammocks in Propositions 3.12 and 3.15, it is
clear that L(F ) has no densely ordered subset. By Remark 2.4, it follows that KGdim(K)
is deﬁned.
(cid:3)

By Lemma 2.6 and Proposition 2.7, we have

Coh(K)/Coh(K)n = Coh(K)Xn

19

for all n ≥ 0, where Xn is the closed subset of Zg(K) consisting of points with CB-
rank greater than or equal to n. Let qn : Coh(K) → Coh(K)Xn denote the corresponding
localisation functor. The following is immediate from Lemma 2.6 and Proposition 2.7.

Corollary 4.4. The CB-rank of Zg(K) is deﬁned and there is a natural bijection

{M ∈ Zg(K) | CB-rank(M) = n} 1−1←→ {F ∈ Coh(K)Xn | F is simple}.

4.1. Cantor-Bendixson rank 0. It is well-known that the simple functors in Coh(K)
correspond to the Auslander-Reiten triangles comprised of compact objects in K; see [2,
§2].

Proposition 4.5. The simple objects in Coh(K) are exactly those of the form Ff where
g
→ Z → ΣX is an Auslander-Reiten triangle. The point of Zg(K) isolated by
X
Ff

f
→ Y
∼= (X, −)/im(f, −) is X.

Corollary 4.6. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra

(1) If gldim Λ = ∞ then ind(X ) is the set of isolated points in Zg(K).
(2) If gldim Λ < ∞ then ind(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) is the set of isolated points in Zg(K).

Proof. This now follows from Corollary 4.4 and the description of Auslander-Reiten tri-
angles in [8] from which it follows that it is the indecomposable perfect complexes which
begin Auslander-Reiten sequences.
(cid:3)

4.2. Cantor-Bendixson rank 1. We begin by identifying certain morphisms that give
rise to simple functors in Coh(K)X0.

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra and recall Notation 3.11.

(1) Suppose gldim Λ < ∞. For 0 ≤ k < r the morphisms

h : X k
h : Z k

i,j → X k
i,j → Z k

i+1,j ⊕ Z k
i,t
i+1,j ⊕ X k+1

h : Z k

i,j → Y k
i,j → Z k

i,j+1 ⊕ Z k
t,j
i,j+1 ⊕ Y k+1
j ′′−1,t

(2) Suppose gldim Λ = ∞. For 0 ≤ k < r the morphisms

h2(cid:1) with h1 6= 0 and h2 6= 0 will be called 1-simple morphisms.

where h =(cid:0) h1

h : X k

i,j → X k

i+1,j ⊕ Z k

h : Z k

j → Z k

j+1 ⊕ X k+1
i,j ′−1

where h =(cid:0) h1

h2(cid:1) with h1 6= 0 and h2 6= 0 will be called 1-simple morphisms.

From Lemma 4.2, which correlates subfunctors of Fh with factorisations of h, and our
description of morphisms, it is clear that q0(Fh) is a simple functor if h is a 1-simple
morphism. Since these functors are simple, it follows from Corollary 4.4 that there are
corresponding indecomposable pure-injective objects with CB-rank equal to 1.

Proposition 4.8. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra.

(1) If gldim Λ = ∞ then the set ind(eZ) is a complete list of indecomposable, pure-

(2) If gldim Λ < ∞ then the set ind(X∞ ∪ X−∞ ∪ Y∞ ∪ Y−∞) is a complete list of

injective complexes of CB rank 1.

indecomposable, pure-injective complexes of CB-rank 1.

Lemma 4.9. In the set-up of Proposition 4.8, the complexes listed in each case are
indecomposable, pure-injective and of CB-rank 1.

20

Proof. For each of these complexes there is a 1-simple morphism f such that the open set
corresponding to the functor (X, −)/ im (f, −), where X is the domain of f , contains just
that complex and complexes of CB-rank 0. So this is immediate from Proposition 2.7
together with the description of the Hom-hammocks in Propositions 3.12 and 3.15. (cid:3)

To prove that the list is complete, we ﬁrst need a deﬁnition and some preliminary

results.

Deﬁnition 4.10. If h : A → B1 ⊕ B2 and h′ : C → D1 ⊕ D2 are 1-simple morphisms,
then we say that h ∼ h′ if and only if A and C are contained the same ray and B2 and
D2 are contained in the same coray of the AR quiver. Note: when Λ has inﬁnite global

dimension, objects on the righthand beam of the eZ components are on the same ray or

coray if and only if they are equal. This is clearly an equivalence relation on the set of
1-simple morphisms.

From the description of the Hom-hammocks in Propositions 3.12 and 3.15, we see that
(Fh) and (Fg) contain the same pure-injective with CB-rank 1 exactly when h ∼ g. So the
following corollary is immediate from Corollary 4.4 and inspection of the Hom-hammocks.

Corollary 4.11. Let h and g be 1-simple morphisms. Then, q0(Fh) = q0(Fg) if and only
if h ∼ g.

Next we will prove that all simple functors in Coh(K)X0 arise from 1-simple morphisms.

Lemma 4.12. Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category and let f : A → B be
a morphism in Tc. If q : Coh(T) → Coh(T)X is a localisation functor and q(Ff ) is simple,
then there exists some g : C → D in Tc such that q(Ff ) = q(Fg) and C is indecomposable.
Proof. Suppose A = A′ ⊕ A′′ where A′, A′′ ∈ Tc are nonzero. Since (A, −) ∼= (A′, −) ⊕
(A′′, −), we have Ff
image in (A′, −) ⊕ (A′′, −). Consider the subfunctors of Ff

∼=(cid:0)(A′, −) ⊕ (A′′, −)(cid:1)/ im(f, −) where we identify im(f, −) with its

and

(im(f,−)+A)/im(f,−)

∼= (A′,−)/im(f,−)∩(A′,−) = H ′

(im(f,−)+A)/im(f,−)

∼= (A′′,−)/im(f,−)∩(A′′,−) = H ′′.

The sum of these subfunctors is Ff so, since q(Ff ) is simple, the image of at least one of
them under q equals q(Ff ). Hence either q(Ff ) ∼= q(H) or q(Ff ) ∼= q(H ′).

Now, im(f, −) ∩ (A′, −) ⊆ (A′, −) is a ﬁnitely generated subfunctor so, by Lemma 4.2,
there exists some g : A′ → B′ in Tc such that im(g, −) ∼= im(f, −) ∩ (A′, −) and similarly
with A′′ in place of A. As Tc is Krull-Schmidt, the result follows.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.13. Suppose q0(Ff ) is simple in Coh(K)X0, then there exists a 1-simple
morphism h such that q0(Ff ) = q0(Fh).

The proof for the ﬁnite global dimension case can be found in [9]; our proof applies to

both inﬁnite and ﬁnite global dimension.
Proof. If f = gh, then Fh is a factor of Ff . Thus, for any such h, we have q0(Fh) ∼= q0(Ff )
if and only if q0(Fh) 6= 0. We have already observed that if h is a 1-simple morphism,
then q0(Fh) 6= 0 so it remains to show that we always have a factorisation f = gh where
i=1 Bi where A, B1, . . . , Bn

h is 1-simple. By Lemma 4.12 we may assume that f : A →Ln

are indecomposable objects in Tc.

We observe that the Hom-hammock structure, combined with Proposition 3.16, implies
that there is a 1-simple morphism through which f factors, except in the following cases:

21

(1) A = X k

i,j for some 0 ≤ k < r and i ≤ j and Bl = X k

i,j+t for some t ≥ 0 and

1 ≤ l ≤ n.

(2) A = Y k

i,j for some 0 ≤ k < r and j ≤ i and Bl = Y k

i+t,j for some t ≥ 0 and

1 ≤ l ≤ n.

(3) A = Z k

i,j for some 0 ≤ k < r and i, j ∈ Z and Bp = Z k

i+t,j, Bq = Z k

i,j+s for some

t, s ≥ 0 and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ n.

We argue, by contradiction, that none of these cases arise.

In each of these cases,
by inspection of the Hom-hammocks, the set of indecomposable compact objects C for
which Ff (C) 6= 0 is ﬁnite. By Corollary 4.6, the open set (Ff ) contains only ﬁnitely
many isolated points of Zg(K). It follows from Lemma 4.3, that the CB-rank of Zg(K) is
deﬁned and so the isolated points are dense (see, for example, [27, Lem. 5.3.36]). But each
isolated point, being of ﬁnite endolength, is closed (see [27, Thm. 5.1.12]) so there are no
other points in (Ff ). Since these are the only points on which Ff is nonzero and since
their direct sum is of ﬁnite endolength, it follows that Ff is ﬁnite length and q0(Ff ) = 0
which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

The completeness statement in Proposition 4.8 now follows from the corollary below.

Corollary 4.14. The simple objects in Coh(K)X0 are in natural one-to-one correspon-
dence with the ∼-equivalence classes of 1-simple morphisms.

4.3. Cantor-Bendixson rank 2. We obtain Coh(K)X1 by localising Coh(K) at the Serre
subcategory consisting of the functors F such that q0(F ) has ﬁnite length.
Remark 4.15. Since the isolation condition holds and using Corollary 3.8, we may apply
a similar argument to the one contained in the proof of Proposition 4.13 to obtain that an
object q0(F ) in Coh(K)X0 is ﬁnite length if and only if (F ) contains ﬁnitely many points
of CB-rank 1.

Proposition 4.16. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra of either ﬁnite or inﬁnite global
dimension. An object q1(F ) in Coh(K)X1 is simple if and only if q1(F ) = q1((Z k
j , −)) for
some j, k.

Proof. We give an argument for the case where Λ has inﬁnite global dimension; the case
where Λ has ﬁnite global dimension can be found in [9].

i,j, −)) = 0 and q1((Z k

Note that, by Remark 4.15 and the description of Hom-hammocks in Proposition 3.15,
the objects q1((X k
It
follows from this and Lemma 4.12 that any simple object will be of the form q1(Ff )
where f : Z k
j → B for some compact object B, j ∈ Z and 0 ≤ k < r. It remains to show
that q1((Z k
j , −)) is simple. Any coherent subobject of q1((Z k
j , −)) will (by Lemma 4.2) be
the image under q1 of some im(f, −) ⊆ (Z k
j , −) where f : Z k
i=1 Bi with B1, . . . , Bn
indecomposable. Note that im(f, −) is the sum of the im(πif, −) where πi is the projection
to Bi. If Bi = Z k
t for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n and t ≥ j, then Remark 4.15 and Proposition 3.15
gives us that q1(Ff ) = 0 and so q1((Z k
j , −)) = q1(im(f, −)). So consider the case where
i=1 Bi, −) → im(f, −)
(cid:3)

Bi ∈ X k+1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then there is an epimorphism (Ln

and so q1(im(f, −)) = 0.
Corollary 4.17. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra of either ﬁnite or inﬁnite global
dimension. The set Z∞ is a complete list of all indecomposable, pure-injective complexes
of CB-rank 2.

This now completes the proof of Theorem 4.1. Although we do not do it here explicitly,
using these methods and results, it is possible to obtain a complete description of the
topology of the Ziegler spectrum of K.

5. Indecomposable complexes with compact support

Before showing that all indecomposable objects of K are pure-injective, we establish
some preliminary results which hold for Λ of both ﬁnite and inﬁnite global dimension.
For an object M of a compactly generated triangulated category T, its support is the
Ziegler-closed subset supp(M) := hMi ∩ Zg(T), where hMi is the deﬁnable subcategory
generated by M; see Deﬁnition 1.4. Recall the deﬁnition of localisation at a deﬁnable
subcategory from Section 2.4.

Lemma 5.1. Let M be an object in a compactly generated triangulated category T. If
supp(M) contains a compact object C such that {C} = (F ) ∩ supp(M) for some functor
F ∈ Coh(T) whose image is simple in Coh(T)supp(M ), then C is a direct summand of M.
Proof. Let q : Coh(T) → Coh(T)supp(M ) be the localisation functor, which is left adjoint to
the canonical embedding i : Coh(T)supp(M ) ֒→ Coh(T). Recall from Section 2.4, that there
is a parallel and compatible localisation (Mod-Tc)supp(M ), whose localisation functor and
canonical embedding we denote by q and i again.

Let F be as in the statement of the lemma. Since F is nonzero in Coh(T)supp(M ),
F (M) 6= 0 and, since C ∈ (F ), F (C) 6= 0. By Lemma 1.8, F = G∨ for some functor
G ∈ mod-Tc and q(G) must also be simple in (Mod-Tc)supp(M ). Also by that result,
(G, (−, M)) 6= 0 and (G, (−, C)) 6= 0.

Since (−, M) and (−, C) are torsionfree it follows that (q(G), q(−, M)) 6= 0 and
(q(G), (−, C)) 6= 0, so there are embeddings k : q(G) ֒→ q(−, M) and j : q(G) ֒→ q(−, C).
Since C is an indecomposable pure-injective, by [27, Prop 11.1.31] q(−, C) is an indecom-
posable injective object of (Mod-Tc)supp(M ), thus q(−, C) is the injective hull of q(G) and
so j must embed q(G) as the simple socle of q(−, C). The cokernel of j is ﬁnitely presented
so, since q(−, M) is fp-injective, there exists some morphism h : q(−, C) → q(−, M) such
that k = hj. As q(−, C) has simple essential socle, h must be a monomorphism.

Identifying h with its image under i, we can regard h as a monomorphism from (−, C)(∼=
iq(−, C)) to (−, M) in Mod-Tc. Since C is compact, Yoneda’s lemma says that h must be
induced by some h′ : C → M in T and by deﬁnition this must be a pure monomorphism.
But C is pure-injective so we must conclude that h′ splits and C is a direct summand of
M.

Corollary 5.2. Let M be an indecomposable object of K and suppose C ∈ supp(M) is a
compact object which is isolated in supp(M). Then C = M.

Proof. By Lemma 4.3, KGdim(K) < ∞ whence the isolation condition holds for Zg(K) by
Lemma 2.6. Therefore there exists a functor F ∈ Coh(K) such that {C} = (F )∩supp(M)
and q(F ) ∈ (Coh(K))supp(M ) is simple. Hence, by Lemma 5.1, C is a direct summand of
M and hence C = M.
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.3. Let M be an indecomposable object of K. If C ∈ supp(M) is compact
then M is compact.
Proof. If C ∈ Kb(proj-Λ), then C is isolated in Zg(K) and so is also isolated in supp(M), so
Lemma 2.6 applies. Otherwise, without loss of generality, assume that supp(M) ⊆ Zg(K)′,
i.e. C is a compact but nonperfect object, in particular, K must have inﬁnite global
dimension. By Proposition 4.8 C has CB-rank 1, hence is isolated in Zg(K)′ and hence
in supp(M); now apply Corollary 5.2.

6. Indecomposable complexes for infinite global dimension

derived-discrete algebras

Recall notation and the structure of add(Str-Λ) from Section 3.4 in the case gldim Λ =

∞.

Setup 6.1. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra with gldim Λ = ∞. Consider the noncom-
pact, right-inﬁnite string complexes X k
i,∞ forming the lefthand beams of the ladder type
AR components ˜Z k. For each 0 ≤ k < r, there is a sequence of irreducible morphisms

We deﬁne X k

i,∞ and write eX :=Lr−1

k=0 X k

In Theorem 6.8 we obtain the pure-injectivity of each indecomposable complex of K

as a corollary of the fact that eX is Σ-pure-injective – a strengthening of the deﬁnition of

pure-injectivity.

Deﬁnition 6.2. An object of T is Σ-pure-injective if the coproduct N (I) is pure-injective
for any (possibly inﬁnite) set I. Equivalently, N is Σ-pure-injective if and only if for each
C ∈ Tc, HomT(C, N) satisﬁes the descending chain condition on EndT(N)-submodules.

Remark 6.3. There are convenient references for the equivalence above and related
results in the context of module and functor categories, hence which apply directly to
Mod-Tc. In view of the equivalence Pinj(T) ≃ Inj(Mod-Tc) on page 5 between objects and,
Lemma 1.8, between concepts involving deﬁnability, these references thus apply equally
to compactly generated triangulated categories. We will use the facts that any object of
ﬁnite endolength is Σ-pure-injective (see [27, Cor. 4.4.24]), that a direct sum of ﬁnitely
many Σ-pure-injective objects is Σ-pure-injective (see [27, Lem. 4.4.26]), and that if M
is Σ-pure-injective then every object in the deﬁnable subcategory generated by M is
Σ-pure-injective (see [27, Prop. 4.4.27]).

We now turn to the case that C is a nonperfect compact string complex, i.e. by

Proposition 6.6. Suppose we are in the situation of Setup 6.1. Then the direct sum of

Proof. By Lemmas 6.4 and 6.5, HomK(C, X k
∞) satisﬁes the descending chain condition
for each 0 ≤ k < r and each indecomposable compact object C of K. Since the functor
HomK(−, X k
∞) satisﬁes
the descending chain condition for each compact object C of K. By the equivalent for-
mulation of Σ-pure-injectivity in Deﬁnition 6.2, it follows that X k
∞ is Σ-pure-injective.
(cid:3)

∞) commutes with ﬁnite direct sums, it follows that HomK(C, X k

By Remark 6.3, eX is Σ-pure-injective.

Corollary 6.7. Let Λ be a derived-discrete algebra with gldim Λ = ∞.
If M is an
indecomposable object of K such that supp(M) contains only noncompact objects, then M
is Σ-pure-injective.

Proof. Let Z := eX ⊕(cid:0)Lr−1

∞(cid:1) be the direct sum of all noncompact objects in the

Ziegler spectrum Zg(K), see Remark 3.10. Then Z is Σ-pure-injective since it is a ﬁnite
direct sum of Σ-pure-injective objects (by Proposition 6.6 and 3.8). Then the deﬁnable
subcategory hZi contains only Σ-pure-injective objects. But by assumption hMi ⊆ hZi
and therefore M is Σ-pure-injective.
(cid:3)

k=0 Z k

Putting this together gives Theorem B in the inﬁnite global dimension case.

Theorem 6.8. Suppose Λ is a derived-discrete algebra with gldim Λ = ∞. The objects
of Str-Λ form a complete list of indecomposable objects of K. In particular, each inde-
composable object of K is pure-injective.

Proof. Suppose M is an indecomposable object of K.
If supp(M) contains a compact
pure-injective then M itself is compact by Corollary 5.3 and therefore pure-injective; see
Proposition 3.6 and Remark 3.10. So we may assume that supp(M) contains no compact
pure-injective objects, whence Corollary 6.7 tells us that M is in fact Σ-pure-injective.
Now Theorem 4.1 tells us that Str-Λ is a complete list of indecomposable, pure-injective
complexes in K.
(cid:3)

7. Indecomposable complexes for finite global dimension

derived-discrete algebras

In this section, we complete the proof that all indecomposable complexes in K for
a derived-discrete algebra Λ are pure-injective by treating the ﬁnite global dimension
case. We refer to Section 3.3 for the structure of the AR quiver whose vertices are the
indecomposable pure-injective complexes. We start by showing that any indecomposable
complex whose support contains only pure-injective complexes of CB rank 2 is already
on our list.

Lemma 7.1. Let M be an indecomposable object in K. If every indecomposable pure-
injective in supp(M) has Cantor-Bendixson rank 2, then M is Σ-pure-injective.

25

Proof. By Corollary 4.17, there are only ﬁnitely many pure-injective objects with Cantor-
Bendixson rank 2. By Corollary 3.8 each has ﬁnite endolength, hence is Σ-pure-injective.
Thus, supp(M) is a ﬁnite set in which each object is Σ-pure-injective.

Let N be the direct sum of one copy of each object of supp(M). Then N is Σ-pure-
injective, hence every object in the deﬁnable subcategory that N generates, in particular
M, is Σ-pure-injective by Remark 6.3.
(cid:3)

We shall invoke the following setup.

Setup 7.2. Let X0 ⊂ Zg(K) be the closed set of non-isolated points and consider the
localisation adjoint pair from Section 2.4,

Mod-Kc

q

i

/ (Mod-Kc)X0,

where the localisation functor q is left adjoint to the canonical inclusion i.

Let M be an indecomposable complex in K. By Corollary 5.3 and Lemma 7.1, we may
assume that supp(M) contains no compact objects and at least one object of CB rank 1.
Let N ∈ supp(M) be such a complex of CB rank 1. By Section 3.3 and Proposition 4.8,
N lies in one of the A∞
∞ components of add(Str-Λ). If N ∈ X∞ ∪ Y∞ there is a sequence
of indecomposable complexes and irreducible morphisms
α3−→ N4

α4−→ · · · .

α1−→ N2

α2−→ N3

N = N1

(2)

We shall write βn = αn · · · α2α1 for the n-fold successive composition of the αi. If N ∈
X−∞ ∪ Y−∞ there is a sequences of indecomposable complexes and morphisms

(3)

N

γ0−→ L1

α4−→ · · · .

in which the Li lie the corresponding Y∞ or X∞ component admitting nontrivial maps
from N, and in which the αi are irreducible morphisms. We shall write γn = αn · · · α1γ0.

The sequence (2) induces the following sequence in Mod-Kc,

(−,α3)
−→ (−, N4)
Likewise, the sequence (3) induces the following sequence in Mod-Kc.

(−,α1)
−→ (−, N2)

(−,α2)
−→ (−, N3)

(−, N) = (−, N1)

(−,α4)

(−,γ0)
−→ (−, L1)

(−,α1)
−→ (−, L2)

(−,α2)
−→ (−, L3)

(−,α3)
−→ · · · .

Remark 7.3. If M ∈ ind(K) is such that supp(M) does not contain any isolated points,
then (−, M) ∼= i◦ q(−, M). This follows from [27, Cor. 12.3.3], though here the statement
is simpliﬁed since, as described in Section 2.4, we can work in Mod-(Tc) rather than in
an associated functor category.

Lemma 7.4. In the situation of Setup 7.2, we have the following sequence of subfunctors
of (−, N),

ker(−, β1) ֒→ ker(−, β2) ֒→ · · ·

or

ker(−, γ0) ֒→ ker(−, γ1) ֒→ · · ·

such that Sn≥1 ker(−, βn) = (−, N) or Sn≥0 ker(−, γn) = (−, N).

Proof. It is enough to check the statement on compact objects lying in H−
∞(N) (see
Section 3.5). There are essentially two cases: N lies in an X∞ or Y∞ component, or else
N lies in an X−∞ or Y−∞ component. One can then check the statement by comparing the
relevant Hom-hammocks, see Figure 4 for the relevant diagrams, where the top diagram
refers to the case that N lies in an X∞ or Y∞ component and the bottom diagram to the
case N lies in an X−∞ or Y−∞ component.

Figure 4. Above: the situation in (2). The darkest shaded region shows
the objects C such that (C, N) 6= 0 but where there are nontrivial maps
f : C → N such that f ∈ ker(C, βt+1). The intermediate shaded region
together with the darkest shaded region shows those objects such that
(C, N) 6= 0, and where there are nontrivial maps f : C → N such that f ∈
ker(C, βs+1). The three shaded regions show objects C such that (C, N) 6= 0
The dashed and dotted regions show objects C such that (C, Nt) 6= 0 and
(C, Ns) 6= 0, respectively. Below: the situation in (3). The regions are
shaded as in the sketch above with γs playing the role of βs.

Lemma 7.5. In the situation of Setup 7.2, the functor q(−, Ni) is injective with simple
socle for each i ≥ 1.

Proof. By Proposition 4.8, each Ni has CB-rank 1. Thus, by Proposition 2.7, there is
a functor S ′
i ∈ Coh(K) whose image is simple in Coh(K)/Coh(K)0 = Coh(K)X0 and such
that Ni is the unique point of CB-rank 1 in the open set (S ′
i). Then we continue as in
the proof of Lemma 5.1.
(cid:3)

Lemma 7.6. In the situation of Setup 7.2, for n ≥ 1 we have

q ker(−, βn)
q ker(−, βn−1)

∼= q ker(−, αn) or

q ker(−, γn)
q ker(−, γn−1)

∼= q ker(−, αn)

and q ker(−, αn) is a simple functor in (Mod-Kc)X0.

Proof. For the ﬁrst claim, observe that there are maps

ker(−, βn)
ker(−, βn−1)

ϕ−→ ker(−, αn)

or

ker(−, γn)
ker(−, γn−1)

ϕ−→ ker(−, αn).

In each case, consider the inclusion im ϕ ֒→ ker(−, αn). Inspecting the Hom-hammocks,
we see that ker(−, αn)/ im ϕ is nonzero on only n − 1 compact objects, namely in the ﬁrst
case the points lying on the blue-dashed coray from the shaded region to the boundary

27

of the AR component in the top diagram of Figure 4, and in the second case the points
lying on a coray essentially similar to that of the red-dotted coray from its intersection
with the red-dashed ray to the boundary of the AR component in the bottom diagram of
Figure 4. It therefore follows that since ker(−, αn)/ im ϕ is nonzero on only ﬁnitely many
points that it is a ﬁnite length functor, cf. Remark 4.15. Hence q ker(−, αn)/ im ϕ = 0,
giving the desired isomorphism.

For the second claim, note that in light of Lemma 1.8 and Corollary 1.11, we need to
exhibit a family H of equivalent 1-simple morphisms (see Deﬁnition 4.7) such that for each
compact object C there exists h ∈ H and an embedding ker(C, αn) → ker(C, h). Since
q ker(−, αn) 6= 0, it will follow that q ker(−, αn) = q ker(−, h) and hence that q ker(−, αn)
is simple.

There are four cases for H depending on which type of component N sits in, where the

reader should recall Notation 3.11:

We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section, which is Theorem B in

the ﬁnite global dimension case.

Theorem 7.7. Suppose Λ is a derived-discrete algebra such that gldim Λ < ∞. The
objects of Str-Λ form a complete list of indecomposable objects of K. In particular, each
indecomposable object of K is pure-injective.

Proof. Theorem 4.1 tells us that Str-Λ is a complete list of indecomposable, pure-injective
objects of K. We need to check that there are no further indecomposable objects.

Suppose, for a contradiction, M ∈ ind(K) is not a string complex. By Corollary 5.3 and
Lemma 7.1, we may assume that M satisﬁes the hypotheses of Setup 7.2. By Lemma 7.5,
there is an embedding qS ֒→ q(−, N) where qS is simple and, arguing as in the proof
of Lemma 5.1, there is also an embedding qS ֒→ q(−, M).
Indeed, we have qS =
q ker(−, α1) = q ker(−, β1). Lemma 7.6 now allows us to repeatedly use the fp injectivity
of q(−, M) to get that the map qS ֒→ q(−, M) lifts along the chain of subfunctors of
Lemma 7.4:

qS = q ker(−, β1)

giving rise to a map q(−, N) → q(−, M), since by Lemma 7.4, lim−→ q ker(−, βi) = q(−, N).
Now using Lemma 7.3, we can deduce that there is a nontrivial map (−, N) ֒→ (−, M).
Pure-injectivity of N now means that (−, N) ֒→ (−, M) is a split monomorphism. Thus,
we have a pure epimorphism f : M → N such that the induced (−, f ) : (−, M) → (−, N)
is split by a morphism τ : (−, N) → (−, M), that is, (−, f )τ = 1(−,N ). We want to ﬁnd
some h : N → M with f h = 1N .

The next part of the argument requires some homotopy string combinatorics; see Sec-
tion 3. Since N lies in an X k
±∞ component, N is a one-sided string complex
(Deﬁnition 3.3). For convenience of exposition, we assume that N = Pw is a right-inﬁnite

without loss of generality that the projective Λ-module sitting in cohomological degree
n, N n, is zero for all n < 0 and N 0 6= 0. An analogous argument holds in the case that
N is a left-inﬁnite string complex.

We remark that the sequence (4) is a subsequence of indecomposable complexes lying on

Deﬁne length ιi = max{n | (ιi)n 6= 0}. In particular, this means that (ιi)n = idC n =

idN n for all n ≤ length ιi − 1 by [1, §3].

Applying (−, f ) : (−, M) → (−, N) to each αi : Ci → Ci+1 gives a commutative tower

We deﬁne a map h : N → M componentwise hn : N n → M n by

noting that since ιi is a graph map that (ιi)n is an isomorphism for each n < length ιi.
We ﬁrst need to check that this is well deﬁned, i.e. if j ≥ i then hn
j for n < length ιi.
Writing αij := αj−1 · · · αi, observe that length αij = length αi = length ιi and that for

Next, we have to show that h is a cochain map. By choosing i suﬃciently large, it is
clear that hn+1dn
M hn for all n < length ιi − 1, in particular, h is a cochain map.
Note that, in light of what follows, h cannot be null-homotopic, for if it were, N itself
would be a null-homotopic giving a contradiction.

N = dn

Finally, we show that f h = idN , for which it is enough to show that, for each n, we have

f n◦hn = idN n. By the splitting we have (Ci, f )(cid:0)τi(ιi)(cid:1) = ιi, that is, f ◦τi(ιi) = ιi which, in

the nth component, becomes f n ◦ (τi(ιi))n = (ιi)n, whence f n ◦ (τi(ιi))n ◦ ((ιi)n)−1 = idN n,
that is f n ◦ hn = idN n, as required. We have therefore found a split monomorphism
h : N ֒→ M, hence M = N.
(cid:3)

Remark 7.8. We ﬁnish by remarking that, although every indecomposable complex over
a derived-discrete algebra is pure-injective, there are complexes which are neither pure-
injective nor a direct sum of indecomposable objects. One may see this directly or use
[4, Thm. 9.3] or [20, Thm. 2.10].
