Abstract

The metric dimension of a general metric space was deﬁned in 1953, applied
to the set of vertices of a graph metric in 1975, and developed further for metric
spaces in 2013. It was then generalised in 2015 to the k-metric dimension of
a graph for each positive integer k, where k = 1 corresponds to the original
deﬁnition. Here, we discuss the k-metric dimension of general metric spaces.

Introduction

The metric dimension of a general metric space was introduced in 1953 in [4, p.95]
but attracted little attention until, about twenty years later, it was applied to the
distances between vertices of a graph [12,14,15,19]. Since then it has been frequently
used in graph theory, chemistry, biology, robotics and many other disciplines. The
theory was developed further in 2013 for general metric spaces [1]. More recently, the
theory of metric dimension has been generalised, again in the context of graph theory,
to the notion of a k-metric dimension, where k is any positive integer, and where the
case k = 1 corresponds to the original theory [7–11]. Here we develop the idea of
the k-metric dimension both in graph theory and in metric spaces. As the theory is
trivial when the space has at most two points, we shall assume that any space we
are considering has at least three points. Finally, whenever we discuss a connected
graph G, we shall always consider the metric space (X, d), where X is the vertex set
of G, and d is the usual graph metric in which the distance between two vertices is
the smallest number of edges that connect them.

1

Let (X, d) be a metric space. If X is a ﬁnite set, we denote its cardinality by
|X|; if X is an inﬁnite set, we put |X| = +∞. In fact, it is possible to develop the
theory with |X| any cardinal number, but we shall not do this. The distances from a
point x in X to the points a in a subset A of X are given by the function a 7→ d(x, a),
and the subset A is said to resolve X if each point x is uniquely determined by this
function. Thus A resolves X if and only if d(x, a) = d(y, a) for all a in A implies
that x = y; informally, if an object in x knows its distance from each point of A,
then it knows exactly where it is located in X. The class R(X) of subsets of X that
resolve X is non-empty since X resolves X. The metric dimension dim(X) of (X, d)
is minimum value of |S| taken over all S in R(X). The sets in R(X) are called the
metric generators, or resolving subsets, of X, and S is a metric basis of X if S ∈ R(X)
and |S| = dim(X). A metric generator of a metric space (X, d) is, in eﬀect, a global
co-ordinate system on X. For example, if (x1, . . . , xm) is an ordered metric generator
of X, then the map ∆ : X → Rm given by

∆(x) =(cid:16)d(x, x1), . . . , d(x, xm)(cid:17)

(1)

is injective (for this vector determines x), so that ∆ is a bijection from X to a subset
of Rm, and X inherits its co-ordinates from this subset.

Now let k be a positive integer, and (X, d) a metric space. A subset S of X is a
k-metric generator for X (see [7]) if and only if any pair of points in X is distinguished
by at least k elements of S: that is, for any pair of distinct points u and v in X, there
exist k points w1, w2, ..., wk in S such that

d(u, wi) 6= d(v, wi),

i = 1, . . . , k.

A k-metric generator of minimum cardinality in X is called a k-metric basis, and
its cardinality, which is denoted by dimk(X), is called the k-metric dimension of X.
Let Rk(X) be the set of k-metric generators for X. Since R1(X) = R(X), we see
that dim1(X) = dim(X). Also, as inf ∅ = +∞, this means that dimk(X) = +∞ if
and only if no ﬁnite subset of X is a k-metric generator for X.
Given a metric space (X, d), we deﬁne the dimension sequence of X to be the

sequence

and we address the following two problems.

(cid:0)dim1(X), dim2(X), . . . , dimk(X), . . .(cid:1),

• Can we ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a sequence (d1, d2, d3, . . .) to

be the dimension sequence of some metric space?

• How does the dimension sequence of (X, d) relate to the properties of (X, d)?
In Sections 2, 3 and 4 we provide some basic results on the k-metric dimension,
and in Section 5 we calculate the dimension sequences of some metric spaces. We
then apply these ideas to the join of two metric spaces, and to the Cayley graph of a
ﬁnitely generated group.

2

2 Bisectors

As shown in [1], the ideas about metric dimension are best described in terms of
bisectors. For distinct u and v in X, the bisector B(u|v) of u and v is given by

B(u|v) = {x ∈ X : d(x, u) = d(x, v)}.

The complement of B(u|v) is denoted by Bc(u|v); thus

Bc(u|v) = {x ∈ X : d(x, u) 6= d(x, v)},

and this contains both u and v. Whenever we speak of a bisector B, we shall assume
that it is some bisector B(u|v), where u 6= v, so that its complement Bc is not empty.
Let us now consider the k-metric dimension from the perspective of bisectors. A
subset A of X fails to resolve X if and only if there are distinct points u and v in X
such that d(u, a) = d(v, a) for all a in A. Thus A resolves X if and only if A is not
contained in any bisector or, equivalently, if and only if for every bisector B, we have
|Bc ∩ A| ≥ 1. This leads to an alternative (but equivalent) deﬁnition of the metric
dimension dim(X), namely

dim(X) = inf{|A| : A ⊂ X and, for all bisectors B, |Bc ∩ A| ≥ 1}.

Again, this inﬁmum may be +∞. The extension to the k-metric dimension dimk(X)
of X is straightforward:

dimk(X) = inf{|A| : A ⊂ X and, for all bisectors B, |Bc ∩ A| ≥ k}.

(2)

Note that if X is a ﬁnite set then dim|X|+1(X) = +∞.
Clearly, the values dimk(X) depend only on the class B of bisectors in X; for
example, dim1(X) = 1 if and only if there is some point in X that is not in any
bisector. More generally, in all cases, dimk(X) ≥ k, and equality holds here if and
only if there are k points of X that do not lie in any bisector. For example, if X is the
real, closed interval [0, 1] with the Euclidean metric, then dimk(X) = k for k = 1, 2.

For a more general example of this type, let X = {√p : p a prime number} with
the Euclidean metric d. If p, q and r are primes, with p 6= q, then √r ∈ B(√p|√q)
implies √r = 1
2(√p + √q); hence 4r = p + q + 2√pq. Since √pq is irrational, this
is false; hence every bisector is empty. It follows that dimk(X) = k for k = 1, 2, . . .;
thus the dimension sequence of (X, d) is (1, 2, 3, . . .).

3 The monotonicity of dimensions

Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then, from (2), we have dimk(X) ≤ dimk+1(X), but
we shall now establish the stronger inequality dimk(X) + 1 ≤ dimk+1(X) (which is
dimk(X) < dimk+1(X) when the dimensions are ﬁnite, but not when they are +∞).
This inequality is known for graphs; see [7, 9]) where it is an important tool.

3

Theorem 3.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then, for k = 1, 2, . . .,
(i) if dimk(X) < +∞ then dimk(X) < dimk+1(X);
(ii) if dimk(X) = +∞ then dimk+1(X) = +∞.
In particular, dimk(X) + 1 ≥ dim1(X) + k.
Proof. First, (ii) follows immediately from (2). Next, (i) is true if dimk+1(X) = +∞,
so we may assume that dimk+1(X) = p < +∞. Thus there is a subset {x1, . . . , xp}
(with the xi distinct) of X such that for every bisector B, |Bc ∩{x1, . . . , xp}| ≥ k + 1.
As k ≥ 1 we see that p ≥ 2. Clearly, |Bc ∩ {x1, . . . , xp−1}| ≥ k for every bisector B;
hence dimk(X) ≤ p − 1 < dimk+1(X). The last inequality follows by induction.

4 The 1-metric dimension

Theorem 3.1 shows that if +∞ occurs as a term in the dimension sequence of (X, d),
then all subsequent terms are also +∞. Thus dim1(X) = +∞ if and only if (X, d)
has dimension sequence (+∞, +∞, +∞, . . .). The next result shows when this is so.
Theorem 4.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then dim1(X) = +∞ if and only if
every ﬁnite subset of X lies in some bisector. In particular, if X is the union of an
increasing sequence of bisectors, then dim1(X) = +∞.
Proof. First, the deﬁnition of dim(X) implies that dim1(X) = +∞ if and only if
every ﬁnite subset of X lies in some bisector. The second statement holds because
if X = ∪nBn, where B1, B2, . . . is an increasing sequence of bisectors, then, given
any ﬁnite subset {x1, . . . , xm} of X, each xj lies in some Bij , and {x1, . . . , xm} ⊂ Br,
where r = max{i1, . . . , im}.

What can be said if dim1(X) < +∞? It seems that we can obtain very little
information from the single assumption that dim1(X) < +∞; for example, for each
r ≥ 0 choose a point xr in Rn with kxrk = r, and let X = {xr : r ≥ 0}. Then {0} is
a 1-metric basis for X, and dim1(X) = 1 but we can say almost nothing about the
topological structure of X. However, we can say more if we know that X is compact.

Theorem 4.2. Let (X, d) be a compact metric space with dim1(X) = m < +∞.
Then (X, d) is homeomorphic to a compact subset of Rm.

Proof. Suppose that X is compact, and that dim1(X) = m < +∞. Then there is a
1-metric basis {x1, . . . , xm}, and the corresponding bijection ∆ in (1) that maps X
onto some subset of Rm. Now ∆ is continuous on X since, for each j, we have

|∆(x) − ∆(y)| ≤

m

Xj=1

|d(x, xj) − d(y, xj)| ≤ md(x, y).

As ∆ is a continuous, injective map from a compact space to the Hausdorﬀ space Rm
it follows (by a well known result in topology) that it is a homeomorphism.

This result is related to the following result in [1] (see also [16]).

4

Theorem 4.3. If (X, d) is a compact, connected metric space with dim1(X) = 1 then
X is homeomorphic to [0, 1].

The compactness is essential here as there is an example in [1] of a connected,
but not arcwise connected, metric space X with dim1(X) = 1. As X is not arcwise
connected, it is not homeomorphic to [0, 1].
It is conjectured in [1] that if X is
arcwise connected, and dim1(X) = 1 then X is a Jordan arc (this means that X is
homeomorphic to one of the real intervals [0, 1] and [0, +∞)), and we can now show
that this is so.

Theorem 4.4. If X is an arcwise connected metric space with dim1(X) = 1, then X
is a Jordan arc.

Proof. As dim1(X) = 1, there is a metric basis, say {x0} for X, and every point
x of X is uniquely determined by its distance d(x, x0) from x0. Consider the map
∆ : x 7→ d(x, x0) of X into [0, +∞). This map is (uniformly) continuous because

|∆(x) − ∆(y)| = |d(x, x0) − d(y, x0)| ≤ d(x, y),

and as X is arcwise connected (and therefore connected), so ∆(X) is connected.
This means that ∆ is an interval of the form [0, a], where a > 0, or [0, b), where
0 < b ≤ +∞.
Let us consider the case when ∆(X) = [0, a]. As ∆ is injective, we see that for
every r in the interval [0, a] there is some unique xr in X with d(xr, x0) = r. Thus
X = {xr : 0 ≤ r ≤ a}. However, as X is arcwise connected, there is a curve, say
γ : [0, 1] → X with γ(0) = x0 and γ(1) = xa. Now as γ is continuous, the set
{d(cid:0)γ(t), x0(cid:1) : t ∈ [0, 1]} must contain every real number in the interval [0, a], and it
cannot contain any other numbers; thus X = γ([0, 1]). Now γ([0, 1]) is compact for
it is the continuous image of the compact interval [0, 1]; thus X is compact and so,
by Theorem 4.3, X is a Jordan arc.

The argument in the case when ∆(X) = [0, b) is similar. Indeed, the argument
above holds for every a with 0 < a < b, and it is easy to see that this implies that ∆
is a homeomorphism from X to [0, b).

5 Some examples

In order to calculate the k-metric dimension of a metric space we need to understand
the geometric structure of its bisectors, and we now illustrate this with several ex-
amples. In order to maintain the ﬂow of ideas, the details of these examples will be
given later.

Example 5.1. Let (X, d) be any one of the Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic spaces
Rn, Sn and Hn, respectively, each with the standard metric of constant curvature 0,
1 and −1, respectively. The bisectors are well understood in these spaces, and we
shall show that any non-empty open subset of X has k-metric dimension n + k. In
particular, each of these spaces has dimension sequence (n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, . . .).
See [1, 13] for the 1-metric dimensions of these spaces.

5

Example 5.2. Let X be any ﬁnite set with the discrete metric d (equivalently, X
is the vertex set of a complete, ﬁnite graph). For distinct u and v in X we have
B(u|v) = X\{u, v}, so that for any subset S of X, we have B(u|v)c ∩ S = {u, v}∩ S.
Thus if |S ∩ Bc| ≥ 1 for all bisectors B, then S can omit at most one point of
If |Bc ∩ S| ≥ 2 for all bisectors B
X. We conclude that dim1(X) = |X| − 1.
then S = X, and dim2(X) = |X|. We conclude that (X, d) has dimension sequence
(|X| − 1,|X|, +∞, +∞, . . .).
Example 5.3. Let X be the real interval [0, 1], with the Euclidean metric. Then B
is a bisectors if and only if B = {x} for some x in (0, 1). Thus {0} is a 1-metric basis,
and {0, 1} is a 2-metric basis, of [0, 1]. We leave the reader to show that if k ≥ 3
then {0, 1
k , 1} is a k-metric basis, so that [0, 1] has dimension sequence
(1, 2, 4, 5, 6, . . .). A similar argument shows that [0, +∞) has dimension sequence
(1, 3, 4, 5, . . .), and that (−∞, +∞), which is R, has dimension sequence (2, 3, 4, . . .).
Example 5.4. The Petersen graph, which is illustrated in Figure 1, has dimension
sequence (3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, +∞, . . .). The (ﬁnite) values dimk(X) for k = 1, . . . , 6 come
from a computer search, and as dim6(X) = 10 = |X|, we have dim7(X) = +∞.

Example 5.5. Let G be a group with a given set of generators, let V be the vertex
set of the associated Cayley graph of G, and let d be its graph metric.
(i) If G is an inﬁnite cyclic group then (V, d) has dimension sequence (2, 3, 4, . . .).
(ii) If G is a free group on p generators, where p ≥ 2, then (V, d) has dimension
sequence (+∞, +∞, +∞, . . .).
(iii) Let G be an abelian group on p generators, where p ≥ 2, and where each generator
has inﬁnite order. Then (V, d) has dimension sequence (+∞, +∞, +∞, . . .).

6 Three geometries of constant curvature

In this section we give the details of Example 5.1.
It is shown in [1] that if U is
any non-empty, open subset of any one of the three classical geometries Rn, Sn and
Hn, then dim1(U) = n + 1. Here we show that if X is any of these spaces then
dimk(X) = n + k for k = 1, 2, . . .. The same result holds for non-empty open subsets

6

of these spaces, and we leave the reader to make the appropriate changes to the
proofs.

The proof that dimk(X) = n + k when X is one of the three geometries Rn, Sn
and Hn, is largely independent of the choice of X, and depends only on the nature
of the bisectors in these geometries. Each of these three geometries has the following
properties:
dim1(X) = n + 1;
(P1)
there exists x1, x2, . . . in X such that if j1 < j2 < · · · < jn then {xj1, . . . , xjn}
(P2)
lies on a unique bisector B, and no other xi lies on B.
Now (P1) and (P2) imply that dimk(X) = n + k for k = 1, 2, . . .. Indeed, (P2) implies
that for any bisector B, |B ∩ {x1, . . . , xn+k}| ≤ n, so that |Bc ∩ {x1, . . . , xn+k}| ≥ k.
This implies that dimk(X) ≤ n + k. However, (P1) and Theorem 3.1 show that
dimk(X) ≥ n + k. Since we know that each of Rn, Sn and Hn has the property (P1),
it remains to show that they have the property (P2), and this depends on the nature
of the bisectors in these geometries. We consider each in turn.

Euclidean Space Rn
Each bisector in Rn is a hyperplane (that is, the translation of an (n− 1)-dimensional
subspace of Rn), and each hyperplane is a bisector. Any set of n points lies on a
bisector, and there exists sets of n + 1 points that do not lie on any single bisector.
The appropriate geometry here is the aﬃne geometry of Rn, but we shall take a more
informal view. First, we choose n points x1, . . . , xn that lie on a unique hyperplane H.
Next, we select a point xn+1 not on H. Then any n points chosen from {x1, . . . , xn+1}
lie on some hyperplane H ′, and the remaining point does not lie on H ′. Now suppose
that we have constructed the set {x1, . . . , xn+p} with the property that any set of
n points chosen from this lie on a unique hyperplane, say Hα, and that no other xi
lies on Hα. Then we can choose a point xn+p+1 that is not not on any of the (cid:0)n+p
n (cid:1)

hyperplanes Hα, and it is then easy to check that the sequence x1, x2, . . . has the
property (P2).

Although we have not used it, we mention that there is a formula for the n-
dimensional volume V of the Euclidean simplex whose vertices are the n + 1 points
x1, . . . , xn+1 in Rn, namely

(−1)n+1
2n(n !)2 ∆,
where ∆ is the Cayley-Menger determinant given by

and di,j = kxi − xjk. As V = 0 precisely when the points xj lie on a hyperplane,
we see that this condition could be used to provide an algebraic background to the
discussion above. For more details, see [3], [4] and [5]. We also mention that there
are versions of the Cayley-Menger determinant that are applicable to spherical, and
to hyperbolic, spaces.

Spherical Space Sn
Spherical space (Sn, d) is the space {x ∈ Rn+1 : kxk = 1} with the path metric d
induced on Sn by the Euclidean metric on Rn+1. Explicitly, cos d(x, y) = x·y, where
x·y is the usual scalar product in Rn+1. If u and v are distinct points of Sn, we let
BE(u|v) be the Euclidean bisector (in Rn+1) of u and v, and BS(u|v) the spherical
bisector in the space (Sn, d). Then BE(u|v) is a hyperplane that passes through the
origin in Rn+1, and
(3)

BS(u|v) = Sn ∩ BE(u|v).

The bisectors BS(u|v) are the great circles (of the appropriate dimension) on Sn.
The equation (3) implies that the k-metric dimension of the spherical spaces is
the same as for Euclidean spaces. Indeed, our proof for Euclidean spaces depended
on constructing a sequence x1, x2, . . . with the property (P2), and it is clear that this
construction could be carried out in such a way that each xj lies on Sn.

Hyperbolic Space Hn
Our model of hyperbolic n-dimensional space is Poincare’s half-space model

Hn = {(x1, . . . , xn+1 ∈ Rn+1 : xn+1 > 0}

equipped with the hyperbolic distance d which is derived from Riemannian metric
|dx|/xn+1. For more details, see for example, [2,18]. Our argument for Hn is essentially
the same as for Rn and Sn because if u and v are distinct points in Hn, then the
hyperbolic bisector B(u|v) is the set S ∩ Hn, where S is some Euclidean sphere whose
centre lies on the hyperplane xn = 0. We omit the details.

7 The metric dimensions of graphs

The vertex set V of a graph G supports a natural graph metric d, where d(u, v) is
the smallest number of edges that can be used to join u to v. Some basic results on
the k-metric dimension of a graph have recently been obtained in [7–11]. Moreover,
it was shown in [20] that the problem of computing the k-metric dimension of a
graph is NP-complete. A natural problem in the study of the k-metric dimension
of a metric space (X, d) consists of ﬁnding the largest integer k such that there
exists a k-metric generator for X. For instance, for the graph shown in Figure 2 the
maximum value of k is four. It was shown in [8, 9] that for any graph of order n this
problem has time complexity of order O(n3). If we consider the discrete metric space
(X, d0) (equivalently, a compete graph), then dim1(X) = |X|− 1 and dim2(X) = |X|.
Furthermore, for k ≥ 3 there are no k-metric generators for X. In general, for any
metric space (X, d), the whole space X is a 2-metric generator, as two vertices are
distinguished by themselves. As we have already seen, there are metric spaces, like
the Euclidean space Rn, where for any positive integer k, there exist at least one
k-metric generator.

We shall now discuss the dimension sequences of the simplest connected graphs,

namely paths and cycles (and we omit the elementary details).

8

A ﬁnite path Pn is a graph with vertices v1, . . . , vn, edges [v1, v2], . . . , [vn−1, vn],
and bisectors {v2}, . . . ,{vn−1}. We leave the reader to show that Pn has dimension
sequence

((1, 2, +∞, . . .)
(1, 2, 4, 5, . . . , n, +∞, . . .)

if n = 2, 3;
if n ≥ 4.

A semi-inﬁnite path PN is a graph with vertices v1, v2 . . ., edges [v1, v2], [v2, v3], . . ., and
bisectors {v2}, . . .. Thus PN has dimension sequence (1, 3, 4, 5, . . .). A doubly-inﬁnite
path PZ is the graph with vertices . . . , v−1, v0, v1, . . ., edges . . . , [v−1, v0], [v0, v1], . . .,
and bisectors . . . ,{v−1},{v0},{v1}, . . .. Thus PZ has dimension sequence (2, 3, 4, 5, . . .).
We note that a graph G has 1-metric dimension 1 if and only it is Pn or PN [6, 14].
This, together with the results just stated, show that if G is a graph of order two or
more, and k ≥ 2, then dimk(G) = k if and only if G is Pn and k = 2 (see also [7]).
We now consider cycles. A cycle Cn is a graph with vertices v1, . . . , vn, and
edges {v1, v2}, . . . ,{vn−1, vn},{vn, v1}. We must distinguish between the cases where
n is even, and where n is odd (which is the easier of the two cases) and, as typical
examples, we mention that C7 has dimension sequence (2, 3, . . . , 7, +∞, . . .), and C8
has dimension sequence (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, +∞, . . .). Suppose that n is odd; then the
bisectors are the singletons {v}. Thus if S is a set of k + 1 vertices, where k + 1 ≤ n,
then |Bc ∩ S| ≥ k for every bisector B. Thus if n is odd, then dimk(Cn) = k + 1, and
Cn has dimension sequence (2, 3, . . . , n, +∞, . . .).

We now show that C2q has dimension sequence

(2, 3, . . . , q, q + 2, q + 3, . . . , q + q, +∞, . . .).

To see this, label the vertices as vj, where j ∈ Z, and where vi = vj if and only if
i ≡ j (mod n). The vertices vi and vj are antipodal vertices if and only if i − j ≡ q
(mod 2q); thus vj and vj+q are antipodal vertices. The class of bisectors is the class
of sets {v, v∗}, where v is a vertex, and v∗ is the vertex that is antipodal to v. For
k = 1, . . . , q − 1 we can take a set of k + 1 points, no two of which are antipodal, as
a k-metric basis, so that dimk(C2q) = k + 1 for k = 1, . . . , q − 1. To ﬁnd dimq(C2q),
we need to take (for a q-metric basis) a set S which contains two pairs of antipodal
points, and one more point from each pair of the remining antipodal pairs. We leave
the details to the reader.

As an example which joins a path to a cycle, consider the graph G illustrated in
Figure 2 which is obtained from the cycle graph C5 and the path Pt, by identifying

9

one of the vertices of the cycle, say u1, and one of the end vertices of Pt. Let
S1 = {v1, v2}, S2 = {v1, v2, ut}, S3 = {v1, v2, v3, ut} and S4 = {v1, v2, v3, v4, ut}.
Then, for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, the set Sk is k-metric basis of G.

The following lemma is useful when discussing examples in graph theory.

Lemma 7.1. Suppose that a graph G does not have any cycles of odd length. Then
B(u|v) = ∅ when d(u, v) is odd.

The proof is trivial for if x ∈ B(u|v) then there is a cycle of odd length (from u
to x, then to v, and then back to u). This lemma applies, for example, to the usual
grid (or graph) in Rn whose vertex set is Zn. A bipartite graph is a graph G whose
vertex set V splits into complementary sets V1 and V2 such that each of the edges of
G join a point of V1 to a point of V2. As a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no
cycles of an odd length, this lemma is about bipartite graphs.

Example 7.1. Let us now consider a graph G that is an inﬁnite tree in which every
vertex has degree at least three. Now let v be any vertex, select three edges from v,
say [v, a], [v, b] and [v, c]. As G is a tree, if we remove one edge the remaining graph
is disconnected. Now let Gc be the subgraph of G that would be the component
containing c if we were to remove the edge [v, c] from G. It is clear that if u is a
vertex in Gc, then d(a, u) = d(b, u) since any path from a (or b) to u must pass
through the edge [v, c]. We conclude that Gc ⊂ B(a|b). It is now clear from Theorem
4.1 that G has dimension sequence (+∞, +∞, . . .).

For the rest of this section we shall consider the Cayley graph of a group with
a given set of generators as a metric space. Let G be a group and let G0 a set of
generators of G. We shall always assume that if g ∈ G0 then g−1 ∈ G0 also. Then
the Cayley graph of the pair (G, G0) is a graph whose vertex set is G, and such that
the pair (g1, g2) is an edge if and only if g2 = g0g1 for some g0 in G0. Thus, for
example, PZ is the Cayley graph of an inﬁnite cyclic group (on one generator), and
Cn is the Cayley graph of an ﬁnite cyclic group (on one generator). We shall always
assume that the set G0 of generators of G is ﬁnite; then the Cayley graph is locally
ﬁnite (that is, each vertex is the endpoint of only ﬁnitely many edges). Note also
that if a generator g0 has order two then g−1
0 = g0 so this only provides one edge (not
two edges) from each vertex. The following result, which characterises Cayley graphs
within the class of all graphs, is well known.

Theorem 7.2. A graph is a Cayley graph of a group G if and only if it admits a
simply transitive action of G by graph automorphisms.

Theorem 7.2 suggests that if we use the homogeneity implied by this result there
is a reasonable chance of ﬁnding the dimension sequence of a Cayley graph. However,
for a graph that is not the Cayley graph of a group, it seems that we are reduced to
ﬁnding its metric dimensions by a case by case analysis.

We shall now verify the claims made in Example 5.5. First, suppose that G is
a free group on p generators. Then the Cayley graph of G is a tree in which every

10

vertex has degree 2p; thus, using Example 7.1, we see that G has dimension sequence
(+∞, +∞, +∞, . . .).
Next, we consider an abelian group G on two generators of inﬁnite order (the
proof for p generators is entirely similar). The Cayley graph of G has Z2 as its vertex
set and (if we identify the lattice point (m, n) with the Gaussian integer m+ in) edges
[m + in, m + 1 + in] and [m + in, m + i(n + 1)], where m, n ∈ Z. It is (geometrically)
clear that for any m ∈ Z we have, with ζ = m + im,

B(ζ + 1|ζ + i) ⊃ {p + iq : p ≥ m + 1, q ≥ m + 1}.

It now follows from Theorem 4.1 (by taking |m| large and m negative) that G has
dimension sequence (+∞, +∞, . . .).
In contrast to Example 5.5 we have the following result for the inﬁnite dihedral
group whose Cayley graph is an inﬁnite ladder; for example we can take the group
generated by the two Euclidean isometries which, in complex terms, are z 7→ z + 1
and z 7→ ¯z.
Theorem 7.3. The inﬁnite dihedral group has dimension sequence (3, 4, 6, 8, . . .).

Proof. We may assume that (in complex terms) the vertices of the ladder graph are
the points m + in, where m ∈ Z and n = 0, 1. The key to computing the metric
dimensions of the ladder graph is the observation that

B(0|1 + i) = {1, 2, 3, . . .} ∪ {i, i − 1, i − 2, . . .}.

Of course, similar bisectors arise at other pairs of similarly located points; equiv-
alently, each automorphism of the graph maps a bisector to a bisector. All other
bisectors are either empty or of cardinality two. We claim that {0, 1, i} is a 1-metric
basis for the graph so that dim1(G) = 3. Next, it is easy to see that {0, 1, i, 1 + i} is a
2-metric basis for X so that dim2(X) = 4. The set {0, 1, 2, i, 1 + i, 2 + i} is a 3-metric
basis so that dim3(X) = 6. We leave the details, and the remainder of the proof to
the reader.

8 The join of metric spaces

The k-metric dimension of the join G1 + G2 of two ﬁnite graphs G1 and G2 was
studied in [8]. Let us brieﬂy recall the notion of the join of two graphs G1 and G2
with disjoint vertex sets V1 and V2, respectively. The join G1 + G2 of G1 and G2 is
the graph whose vertex set is V1 ∪ V2, and whose edges are the edges in G1, the edges
in G2, together with all edges obtained by joining each point in V1 to each point in
V2. Let d1, d2 and d be the graph metrics of G1, G2 and G1 + G2, respectively; then

d(u, v) =


min{d1(u, v), 2} if u, v ∈ V1;
min{d2(u, v), 2} if u, v ∈ V2;
1

if u ∈ Xi, v ∈ Xj, where i 6= j,

11

because if u, v ∈ V1, say, then for w in V2, we have d1(u, v) ≤ d(u, w) + d(w, v) = 2.
The join of two metric spaces is deﬁned in a similar way, but before we do this
we recall that if (X, d) is a metric space, and t > 0, then dt, deﬁned by

dt(x, y) = min{d(x, y), 2t},

If d(x, y) < 2t then dt(x, y) = d(x, y), so that the dt-metric
is a metric on X.
topology coincides with the d-metric topology on X. As the metric dt will appear in
our deﬁnition of the join, we ﬁrst show how the metric dimension of a single metric
space varies when we distort the metric from d to dt as above. From now on, the
k-metric dimension of (X, dt) will be denoted by dimt

k(X).

Theorem 8.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space, and k a positive integer, and suppose
that 0 < s < t. Then dims
k(X) ≥ dimk(X). However, it can happen that
(4)
k(X) > dimk(X).

k(X) ≥ dimt
dimt

lim
t→+∞

The join of two metric spaces is deﬁned in a similar way to the join of two graphs,
and to motivate this, suppose that (X, d) is a metric space, and that X1 and X2 are
bounded subsets X whose distance apart is very large compared with their diameters.
Then, in some sense, we can approximate the metric space (X1 ∪ X2, d) by replacing
all values d(x1, x2), where xj ∈ Xj, by t, where t is some sort of average of the values
d(x1, x2). We shall now deﬁne the join, so suppose that (X1, d1) and (X2, d2) are
metric spaces, with X1 ∩ X2 = ∅, and t > 0. Then the join of (X1, d1) and (X2, d2)
(relative to the parameter t) is the metric space (X1 ∪ X2, dt), where

dt(u, v) =


dt
1(u, v)
dt
2(u, v)
t

if u, v ∈ X1;
if u, v ∈ X2;
if u ∈ Xi and v ∈ Xj, where i 6= j.

As with graphs, X1 + X2 always represents the metric space (X1 ∪ X2, dt), where in
this case t will be understood from the context.
We might hope that the metric dimension is additive with respect to the join, but
unfortunately it is not. Let X1 = {1, 3} and X2 = {2, 4}, each with the Euclidean
metric, and let t = 1. Then X1∪ X2 = {1, 2, 3, 4} with the metric d1, where d1(1, 3) =
d1(2, 4) = 2 and, for all other x and y, d1(x, y) = 1. The bisectors in X1 + X2 are X1,
X2 and ∅, and from this we conclude that dim1
1(X1+X2) = 3. Obviously, dim1(X1) =
dim1(X2) = 1, so that in this case, dim1(X1) + dim1(X2) < dim1

1(X1 + X2).

We now give some inequalities which hold for the join of two metric spaces.

Theorem 8.2. Let (Xj, dj), j = 1, 2, be metric spaces with X1∩X2 = ∅, and consider
the join (X1 ∪ X2, dt). Then, for any positive integer k, we have
k(X2) ≤ dimt

dimk(X1) + dimk(X2) ≤ dimt

k(X1) + dimt

k(X1 + X2).

(5)

We shall now give an example which shows that (4) can hold; then we end with

the proofs of Theorems 8.1 and 8.2, and stating a consequence of Theorem 8.2.

12

Example 8.1. Let X = R and d(x, y) = |x − y|, so that dim1(X) = 2. We shall
now show that if t > 0 then dimt
1(X) = +∞, so that (4) can hold. Suppose that
a < b, and consider the bisector Bt(a|b). If x ≤ a − 2t, then dt(x, a) = dt(x, b) = 2t
so that x ∈ Bt(a|b). Thus Bt(a|b) ⊃ (−∞, a − 2t]. Now let S be any ﬁnite set, and
let s be the largest element in S. Then Bt(s + 2t, s + 3t) ⊃ (−∞, s] ⊃ S, so that
dimt

1(X) = +∞.
This is a convenient place to describe the notation that will be used in the fol-
lowing two proofs. We have metric spaces (X1, d1) and (X2, d2) with X1 ∩ X2 = ∅.
For j = 1, 2 we use Bj(u|v) for the bisectors in Xj, and dimk(Xj) for their metric
dimensions. Now consider the join (X1 ∪ X2, dt), and its metric subspaces (Xj, dt).
We use Bt(u|v) and Bt
k(X1 + X2) and
dimt
k(Xj) for their metric dimensions. In general, we write [B]c for the complement
of a bisector B of any type.

j(u|v) for the bisectors in these spaces, and dimt

We shall need the following lemma in our proof of Theorem 8.1.

Lemma 8.3. Let (X, d) be a metric space, and suppose that 0 < s < t. Then
B(u|v) ⊂ Bt(u|v) ⊂ Bs(u|v).
Proof. First, observe that for all real r, and all real, distinct α and β, we have
min{α, r} = min{β, r} if and only if (i) r ≤ min{α, β} or (ii) α = β. Now suppose
that x ∈ Bt(u|v). Then dt(x, u) = dt(x, v) so that min{d(x, u), t} = min{d(x, v), t}.
This implies that t ≤ min{d(x, u), d(x, v)} or d(x, u) = d(x, v), and (since s < t) in
both cases we have ds(x, u) = ds(x, v). Thus Bt(u|v) ⊂ Bs(u|v). The proof that
B(u|v) ⊂ Bt(u|v) is trivial:
if x ∈ B(u|v) then d(x, u) = d(x, v) so that dt(x, u) =
dt(x, v); hence x ∈ Bt(u|v).
The proof of Theorem 8.1. Let A be any ﬁnite subset of X. Then, by Lemma 8.3,
for all u and v in X with u 6= v, we have

|A ∩ [B(u|v)]c| ≥ |A ∩ [Bt(u|v)]c| ≥ |A ∩ [Bs(u|v)]c|.

It follows that if A is a k-metric generator for (X, ds) (that is, if, for all u and v,
|A ∩ [Bs(u|v)]c| ≥ k), then it is also a k-metric generator for (X, dt). Thus the
minimum of |S| taken over all k-metric generators S of (X, dt) is less than or equal
to the minimum over all k-metric generators of (X, ds); hence dims
k(X).
The proof that dimt

k(X) ≥ dimt

k(X) ≥ dimk(X) is entirely similar.

The proof of Theorem 8.2. The ﬁrst inequality follows from Theorem 8.1. The in-
equality is trivially true if dimt
k(X1 + X2) = +∞, so we may assume that there is a
k-metric basis, say W , of X1 + X2. Thus |W| = dimt
k(X1 + X2). Now take any u and
v in X1; then

Bt(u|v) = {x ∈ X1 ∪ X2 : dt(x, u) = dt(x, v)} = Bt

1(u|v) ∪ X2,

so that, from Lemma 8.3, [Bt(u|v)]c = [Bt
j = 1, 2. Then, if we let u and v vary over X1, with u 6= v, we ﬁnd that

1(u|v)]c ⊂ X1. We put Wj = W ∩ Xj,

k ≤ |[Bt(u|v)]c ∩ W| = |[Bt

1(u|v)]c ∩ X1 ∩ W| = |[Bt

1(u|v)]c ∩ W1|,

13

so that dimt

k(X1) ≤ |W1|. Similarly, dimt
dimt

k(X2) ≤ |W2|, so that
k(X2) ≤ |W1| + |W2| = |W| = dimt

k(X1) + dimt

k(X1 + X2)

as required.

If (Xj, dj), j = 1, 2, are metric spaces, each with diameter less than t, such that
X1∩X2 = ∅, the for any k-metric basis Ai of (Xj, dj), A1∪A2 is a k-metric generator
for the join (X1 ∪ X2, dt). This shows that dimt
k(X1 + X2) ≤ dimk(X1) + dimk(X2),
and so Theorem 8.2 leads to the following corollary.

Corollary 8.4. Let (Xj, dj), j = 1, 2, be metric spaces, each with diameter less than t,
such that X1∩X2 = ∅. Then, for k = 1, 2, . . ., dimt
k(X1+X2) = dimk(X1)+dimk(X2).
