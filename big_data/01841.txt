VARIATIONS ON THE GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA FOR HILBERT

FUNCTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS

SHREEDEVI K. MASUTI, PARANGAMA SARKAR, AND J. K. VERMA

Abstract. In this expository paper we present proofs of Grothendieck-Serre formula for multi-graded

algebras and Rees algebras for admissible multi-graded ﬁltrations. As applications, we derive formulas

of Sally for postulation number of admissible ﬁltrations and Hilbert coeﬃcients. We also discuss

a partial solution of Itoh’s conjecture by Kummini and Masuti. We present an alternate proof of

Huneke-Ooishi Theorem and a genaralisation for multi-graded ﬁltrations.

1. Introduction

The objective of this expository paper is to collect together several fundamental results about

Hilbert coeﬃcients of admissible ﬁltrations of ideals which can be proved using various avatars of the

Grothendieck-Serre formula for the diﬀerence of the Hilbert function and Hilbert polynomial of a ﬁnite

graded module of a standard graded Noetherian ring. The proofs presented here provide a uniﬁed

way of approaching these results. Some of these results are not known in the multi-graded case. We

hope that the uniﬁed approach presented here could lead to suitable multi-graded analogues of these

results.

We begin by recalling the Grothendieck-Serre formula. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that

∞

the graded rings considered in this paper are standard and Noetherian. Let R =

Rn be a standard

graded Noetherian ring where R0 is an Artinian local ring. Let M = Ln∈Z

R-module of dimension d. The Hilbert function of M is the function H(M, n) = λR0(Mn) for all
n ∈ Z. Here λ denotes the length function. Serre showed that there exists an integer m so that
H(M, n) is given by a polynomial P (M, x) ∈ Q[x] of degree d − 1 such that H(M, n) = P (M, n)
for all n > m. The smallest such m is called the postulation number of M. Let R+ denote the
homogeneous ideal of R generated by elements of positive degree and [H i
(M )]n denote the nth
graded component of the ith local cohomology module H i
(M ) of M with respect to the ideal R+.
We put λR0([H i

The GSF was proved in the fundamental paper [Serre] of J.-P. Serre. We quote from [Brod]: “In this

paper, Serre introduced the theory of coherent sheaves over algebraic varieties over an algebraically

closed ﬁeld and a cohomology theory of such varieties with coeﬃcients in coherent sheaves. He did

speak of algebraic coherent sheaves, as at the ﬁrst time he managed to introduce these theories with

purely algebraic tools, using consequently the Zariski topology instead of the complex topology and

homological methods instead of tools from multivariate complex analysis. Since then, the cohomology

theory introduced in Serre’s paper is often called Serre cohomology or sheaf cohomology.

One of the achievement of Serre’s paper is the Grothendieck-Serre Formula, which is given there

in terms of sheaf cohomology and showed in this way that sheaf cohomology gives a functorial un-

derstanding of the so called postulation problem of algebraic geometry, the problem which classically

consisted in understanding the diﬀerence between the Hilbert function and the Hilbert-polynomial of

the coordinate ring of a projective variety.”

The Grothendieck-Serre Formula (GSF) is valid for non-standard graded rings also if the Hilbert

polynomial P (M, x) is replaced by the Hilbert quasi-polynomial [BH93, Theorem 4.4.3]. The GSF

has been generalized in several directions. For some of the applications, we need it in the context of
Zs-graded modules over standard Ns-graded rings. In order to state the GSF for Zs-graded module,
ﬁrst we set up nptation and recall some deﬁnitions. Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring and
I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. We put e = (1, . . . , 1), 0 = (0, . . . , 0) ∈ Zs and for all i =
1, . . . , s, ei = (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) ∈ Zs where 1 occurs at ith position. For n = (n1, . . . , ns) ∈ Zs,
we write I n = I n1
i = max{0, ni} for all i = 1, . . . , s. For
α = (α1, . . . , αs) ∈ Ns, we put |α| = α1 + · · · + αs. We deﬁne m = (m1, . . . , ms) ≥ n = (n1, . . . , ns)
if mi ≥ ni for all i = 1, . . . , s. By the phrase “for all large n” we mean n ∈ Ns and ni ≫ 0 for all
i = 1, . . . , s. For an Ns (or a Zs)-graded ring T , the ideal generated by elements of degree e is denoted
by T++.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A set of ideals F = {F(n)}n∈Zs is called a Zs-graded I = (I1, . . . , Is)-ﬁltration if

By [HHRT97, Lemma 1.1], dim Supp++(M ) = rel. dim(M ) − s. M. Herrmann, E. Hyry, J. Ribbe
Rn is a standard Noetherian Ns-graded

and Z. Tang [HHRT97, Theorem 4.1] proved that if R = Ln∈Ns
ring deﬁned over an Artinian local ring (R0, m) and M = Ln∈Zs

R-module then there exists a polynomial, called the Hilbert polynomial of M, PM (x1, x2, . . . , xs) ∈
Q[x1, . . . , xs] of total degree dim Supp++(M ) satisfying PM (n) = λ(Mn) for all large n. Moreover all
monomials of highest degree in this polynomial have nonnegative coeﬃcients.

The next two results are due to G. Colom´e-Nin [Gcn08, Propositions 2.4.2, 2.4.3] for non-standard

multigraded rings. In section 2, we present her proofs to prove the same results for standard multi-

graded rings for the sake of simplicity. These results were proved in the bigraded case by A.V.

Jayanthan and J. K. Verma [AJV02].

The above form of the GSF leads to another version of it which gives the diﬀerence between the

R(F) = Mn∈Ns
R′(F) = Mn∈Zs
G(F) = Mn∈Ns
Gi(F) = Mn∈Ns

For F = {I n}n∈Zs, we set R(F) = R(I) and R′(F) = R′(I), G(F) = G(I) and Gi(F) = Gi(I) for all
i = 1, . . . , s.

Deﬁnition 1.6. A Zs-graded I-ﬁltration F = {F(n)}n∈Zs of ideals in R is called an I-admissible
ﬁltration if F(n) = F(n+) and R′(F) is a ﬁnite R′(I)-module. For s = 1, if a ﬁltration F is
I-admissible for some m-primary ideal I then it is also I1-admissible.

Primary examples of I-admissible ﬁltrations are {I n}n∈Zs in a Noetherian local ring and {I n}n∈Zs
in an analytically unramiﬁed local ring. Recall that for an ideal I in R, the integral closure of I is the

ideal

I := {x ∈ R | xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0 for some n ∈ N and ai ∈ I i for i = 1, 2 . . . , n}.

We now set up the notation for a variety of Hilbert polynomials associated to ﬁltrations of ideals.
Let I be an m-primary ideal of a Noetherian local ring (R, m) of dimension d. For a Z-graded I-
admissible ﬁltration I = {In}n∈Z, Marley [Mar89] proved existence of a polynomial PI (x) ∈ Q[x] of
degree d, written in the form,

PI (n) = e0(I)(cid:18)n + d − 1

d

(cid:19) − e1(I)(cid:18)n + d − 2

d − 1 (cid:19) + · · · + (−1)ded(I)

such that PI (n) = HI(n) for all large n, where HI (n) = λ(R/In) is the Hilbert function of the
ﬁltration I. The coeﬃcients ei(I) for i = 0, 1, . . . , d are integers, called the Hilbert coeﬃcients of
I. The coeﬃcient e0(I) is called the multiplicity of I. P. Samuel [Sam51] showed existence of this
polynomial for the I-adic ﬁltration {I n}n∈Z. Many results about Hilbert polynomials for admissible
ﬁltrations were proved in [GR98] and [RV10].

For m-primary ideals I1, . . . , Is, B. Teissier [T73] proved that for all n suﬃciently large, the Hilbert
function HI(n) = λ (R/I n) coincides with a polynomial

PI (n) = Xα=(α1,...,αs)∈Ns

of degree d, called the Hilbert polynomial of I. Here we assume that s ≥ 2 in order to write PI (n)
in the above form. This was proved by P. B. Bhattacharya for s = 2 in [B57]. Here eα(I) are integers
which are called the Hilbert coeﬃcients of I. D. Rees [Rees84] showed that eα(I) > 0 for |α| = d.

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

These are called the mixed multiplicities of I.
For an I-admissible ﬁltration F = {F(n)}n∈Zs in a Noetherian local ring (R, m) of dimension d, Rees
[Rees84] showed the existence of a polynomial

PF (n) = Xα=(α1,...,αs)∈Ns

of degree d which coincides with the Hilbert function HF (n) = λ (R/F(n)) for all large n [Rees84].
This polynomial is called the Hilbert polynomial of F. Rees [Rees84, Theorem 2.4] proved that
eα(F) = eα(I) for all α ∈ Ns such that |α| = d.

In Section 2, we prove the following version of the GSF for the extended Rees algebras.

It was
proved for I-adic ﬁltration and for nonnegative integers by Johnston-Verma [JV95] and for Z-graded
admissible ﬁltration of ideals by C. Blancafort for all integers [Blt97].

Theorem 1.7. [MSV15, Theorem 4.3] Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of dimension d and
I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R.

In section 3, we derive explicit formulas in terms of the Ratliﬀ-Rush closure ﬁltration of a multi-

graded ﬁltration of ideals for the graded components of the local cohomology modules of certain Rees

rings and associated graded rings. For an ideal I in a Noetherian ring R, L. J. Ratliﬀ and D. Rush

[RR78] introduced the ideal

(I k+1 : I k),

˜I = [k≥1

called the Ratliﬀ-Rush closure of I. If I has a regular element then the ideal ˜I has some nice
properties such as for all large n, ( ˜I)n = I n, ˜I n = I n etc. If I is an m-primary regular ideal then ˜I is
the largest ideal with respect to inclusion having the same Hilbert polynomial as that of I. Blancafort
[Blt97] introduced Ratliﬀ-Rush closure ﬁltration of an N-graded good ﬁltration. Let (R, m) be a
Noetherian local ring and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible
ﬁltration of ideals in R. We need the concept of the Ratliﬀ-Rush closure of F in order to ﬁnd formulas

for certain local cohomology modules.

Deﬁnition 1.8. The Ratliﬀ-Rush closure ﬁltration of F = {F(n)}n∈Zs is the ﬁltration of ideals

The next three results to be proved in section 3 are needed to prove several results about Hilbert

coeﬃcients in section 5.

Proposition 1.9. [MSV15, Proposition 3.5] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension
two with inﬁnite residue ﬁeld and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals in R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an

In section 4, we present several applications of the GSF for Rees algebra and associated graded ring

of an ideal. The ﬁrst application due to J. D. Sally, who pioneered these techniques for the study of

Hilbert-Samuel coeﬃcients, shows the connection of the postulation number with reduction number.
Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring, I be an m-primary ideal and F = {In}n∈Z be an admissible
I-ﬁltration of ideals in R.

Deﬁnition 1.12. A reduction of an I-admissible ﬁltration F = {In}n∈Z is an ideal J ⊆ I1 such that
JIn = In+1 for all large n. A minimal reduction of F is a reduction of F minimal with respect to
inclusion. For a minimal reduction J of F, we set

rJ (F) = min{m : JIn = In+1 for n ≥ m} and r(F) = min{rJ (I) : J is a minimal reduction of F}.

For F = {I n}n∈Z, we set rJ (F) = rJ (I) and r(F) = r(I).

Deﬁnition 1.13. An integer n ∈ Z is called the postulation number of F, denoted by n(F), if
PF (m) = HF (m) for all m > n and PF (n) 6= HF (n). It is denoted by n(F).

The next result was proved by J. D. Sally [Sal82] for the m-adic ﬁltration. Her proof remains valid

for any admissible ﬁltration.

Theorem 1.14. Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1 with inﬁnite residue
ﬁeld, I an m-primary ideal and F = {In} be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Let HR(n) =
λ (In/In+1) and PR(X) ∈ Q[X] such that PR(n) = HR(n) for all large n. Suppose grade G(F)+ ≥

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

7

d − 1. Then for a minimal reduction J = (x1, . . . , xd) of F, HR(rJ (F) − d) 6= PR(rJ (F) − d) and
HR(n) = PR(n) for all n ≥ rJ (F) − d + 1.

The following result is due to Marley [Mar89, Corollary 3.8]. We give another proof which follows

from the above theorem.

Theorem 1.15. [Mar89, Corollary 3.8] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
with inﬁnite residue ﬁeld, I an m-primary ideal and F = {In} be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals
in R. Let grade G(F)+ ≥ d − 1. Then r(F) = n(F) + d.

In section 5, we discuss several results about non-negativity of Hilbert coeﬃcients of multi-graded

ﬁltrations of ideals as easy consequences of the GSF for such ﬁltrations. We prove the following result

which implies earlier results of Northcott, Narita and Marley.

Theorem 1.16. [MSV15, Theorem 5.6] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in
R. Then

(1) eα(F) ≥ 0 where α = (α1, . . . , αs) ∈ Ns, |α| ≥ d − 1.
(2) eα(F) ≥ 0 where α = (α1, . . . , αs) ∈ Ns, |α| = d − 2 and d ≥ 2.

We also discuss the results of S. Itoh about non-negativity and vanishing of the third coeﬃcient of
the normal Hilbert polynomial of the ﬁltration {I n}n∈Z in an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay
local ring. We prove an analogue of a theorem due to Sally for admissible ﬁltrations in two-dimensional

Cohen-Macaulay local rings which gives explicit formulas for all the coeﬃcients of their Hilbert poly-

nomial. Here again we show that these formulas follow in a natural way from the variant of GSF for

Rees algebra of the ﬁltration.

Proposition 1.17. Let (R, m) be a two-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring, I be any m-primary
ideal of R and F = {In}n∈Z an admissible I-ﬁltration of ideals in R. Then

˘I1(cid:19),
(R(F))−1(cid:17) = e1(F) + e2(F).

C. Huneke [Hun87] and A. Ooishi [O87] independently proved that if (R, m) is a Cohen-Macaulay
local ring of dimension d ≥ 1 and I is an m-primary ideal then e0(I) − e1(I) = λ(R/I) if and only
if r(I) ≤ 1. Huckaba and Marley [HM97] proved this result for Z-graded admissible ﬁltrations. In
Section 6, we present a proof, due to Blancafort, for Z-graded admissible ﬁltrations of Huneke-Ooishi
Theorem. The original proofs due to Huneke and Ooishi did not employ local cohomology and relied

on use of superﬁcial sequences. Our purpose in presenting the alternative proof using the GSF for

Rees algebras is to motivate the proof of an analogue of the Huneke-Ooishi Theorem for multi-graded

ﬁltrations of ideals.

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

Theorem 1.18. [Bla97, Theorem 4.3.6] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with inﬁnite residue
ﬁeld of dimension d ≥ 1, I1 an m-primary ideal and F = {In}n∈Z be an I1-admissible ﬁltration of
ideals in R. Then the following are equivalent:

(1) e0(F) − e1(F) = λ (R/I1) ,
(2) r(F) ≤ 1.

In this case, e2(F) = · · · = ed(F) = 0, G(F) is Cohen-Macaulay, n(F) ≤ 0, r(F) is independent of
the reduction chosen and F = {I n

1 }.

Using the GSF for multi-graded Rees algebras we prove the following analogue of the Huneke-Ooishi

Theorem for multi-graded admissible ﬁltrations.

Theorem 1.19. [MSV15, Theorem 5.5] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in
R. Then for all i = 1, . . . , s,
(1) e(d−1)ei (F) ≥ e1(F (i)),
(2) e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) ≤ λ(R/F(ei)),
(3) e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) = λ(R/F(ei)) if and only if r(F (i)) ≤ 1 and e(d−1)ei (F) = e1(F (i)).

The vanishing of the constant term of the Hilbert polynomial of a ﬁltration gives insight into

the ﬁltration as well as the local ring. For any m-primary ideal I in an analytically unramiﬁed

local ring (R, m) of dimension d, the normal Hilbert function of I is deﬁned to be the function
H(I, n) = λ(R/I n). Rees showed that for large n, it is given by the normal Hilbert polynomial

P (I, x) = e0(I)(cid:18)x + d − 1

d

(cid:19) − e1(I)(cid:18)x + d − 2

d − 1 (cid:19) + · · · + (−1)ded(I).

The integers e0(I), e1(I), . . . , ed(I) are called the normal Hilbert coeﬃcients of I. Rees deﬁned a
2-dimensional normal analytically unramiﬁed local ring (R, m) to be pseudo-rational if e2(I) = 0 for
all m-primary ideals. It can be shown that two-dimensional local rings having a rational singularity
are pseudo-rational. It is natural to characterise e2(I) = 0 in terms of computable data. This was
considered by Huneke [Hun87] in which he proved

Theorem 1.20. [Hun87, Theorem 4.5] Let (R, m) be a two-dimensional analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-
Macaulay local ring. Let I be an m-primary ideal. Then e2(I) = 0 if and only if I n = (x, y)I n−1 for
n ≥ 2 and for any minimal reduction (x, y) of I.

A similar result was proved by Itoh [Ito95] about vanishing of e2(I). Using the GSF for multi-graded
ﬁltrations, we prove the following theorem which characterises the vanishing of the constant term of

the Hilbert polynomial of a multi-graded admissible ﬁltration and derive results of Itoh and Huneke

as consequences.

2. Variations on the Grothendieck-Serre formula

The main aim of this section is to prove the Grothendieck-Serre formula (Theorem 2.3) and its

variations. In [Gcn08, Propositions 2.4.2, 2.4.3], Colom´e-Nin proved the Grothendieck-Serre formula

for non-standard multigraded rings. For the sake of simplicity, we present her proof for standard

multi-graded rings. As a consequence we prove [MSV15, Theorem 4.3] (Theorem 2.5) which relates

the diﬀerence of Hilbert polynomial and Hilbert function of an I-admissible ﬁltration to the Euler

characteristic of the extended multi-Rees algebra.

We recall the following Lemma from [Gcn08] which is needed to prove Theorem 2.3.

for all i ≥ 1. Since PM (X1, . . . , Xs) has degree −1, we have PM (n) = 0 for all n ∈ Zs. Thus we get

Therefore by the equation (2.3.1), it is enough to prove the result for M ′. By [Gcn08, Lemma 2.4.1],

3. Formulas for local cohomology modules

In this section we derive formulas for the graded components of the local cohomology modules

of certain Rees rings and associated graded rings in terms of the Ratliﬀ-Rush closure ﬁltration of a

multi-graded ﬁltration of ideals. These generalise [Blt97, Proposition 2.5 and Theorem 3.5]. We use

these formulas to derive various properties of the Hilbert coeﬃcients in further sections.

4. The postulation number and the reduction number

In [Sal82, Proposition 3] Sally gave a nice relation between the postulation number and the reduction
number of the ﬁltration {mn}n∈N. In [Mar89, Corollary 3.8] Marley generalised this relation for any
I-admissible ﬁltration. In this section we derive these results using the Grothendieck-Serre formula.

We recall few preliminary results about superﬁcial sequences which are useful to apply induction in

the study of Hilbert coeﬃcients.
Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring, I be an m-primary ideal and F = {In}n∈Z be an I-admissible
ﬁltration of ideals in R.

Deﬁnition 4.1. An element x ∈ It \ It+1 is called superﬁcial element for F of degree t if there
exists an integer c ≥ 0 such that (In+t : x) ∩ Ic = In for all n ≥ c.

If the residue ﬁeld of R is inﬁnite then there exists a superﬁcial element of degree 1 [Rho71,
If grade(I1) ≥ 1 and x ∈ I1 is superﬁcial for F, Huckaba and Marley [HM97],
Proposition 2.3].
showed that x is nonzerodivisor in R and (In+1 : x) = In for all large n. If dimension of R is d ≥ 1,
x ∈ I1 \ I2 is superﬁcial element for F and x is a nonzerodivisor on R then by [Mar89, Lemma A.2.1],
ei(F) = ei(F ′) for all 0 ≤ i < d where R′ = R/(x) and F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z. The following lemma is due
to Blancafort [Bla97, Lemma 3.1.6]. This lemma was ﬁrst proved by Huckaba [Huc87, Lemma 1.1] for

I-adic ﬁltration.

Lemma 4.2. Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1, I an m-primary ideal
and F = {In}n∈Z be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Suppose J is a minimal reduction of F
and there exists an x ∈ J \ I2 such that x∗ = x + I2 is a nonzerodivisor in G(F). Let R′ = R/(x).
Then r(F) = r(F ′) where F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z.

Proof. We denote r(F) and r(F ′) by r and s respectively. It is clear that s ≤ r. We use the notation
“ ′ ” to denote the image in R′. Let n ≥ s and a ∈ In+1. Then a′ ∈ J ′I ′
n. Hence a = p + xq for some
p ∈ JIn and q ∈ R. Therefore xq ∈ In+1 which implies q ∈ (In+1 : x). Since x∗ is a nonzerodivisor in
G(F), we have (In+1 : x) = In for all n ∈ Z. Hence we get the required result.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.3. If x = x1, . . . , xr ∈ I1, we say x is a superﬁcial sequence for F if for all 0 ≤ i < r,
xi+1 is superﬁcial for F/(x1, . . . , xi).

Suppose (R, m) is Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d, I1 is an m-primary ideal and F = {In}
is an I1-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Suppose x1, . . . , xr ∈ I1 and 1 ≤ r ≤ d, then x1, . . . , xr is
a superﬁcial sequence for F if and only if x1, . . . , xr is R-regular sequence and there exists an integer
n0 ≥ 0 such that for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r,

(x1, . . . , xi) ∩ In = (x1, . . . , xi)In−1 for all n ≥ n0.

This result was ﬁrst proved by Valabrega and Valla [VV78, Corollary 2.7] for I-adic ﬁltration and
then by Huckaba and Marley [HM97] for Z-graded admissible ﬁltartions. Marley [Mar89, Proposition

A.2.4] showed that if residue the ﬁeld is inﬁnite then any minimal reduction of F can be generated by

a superﬁcial sequence for F. The following lemma is due to Huckaba and Marley [HM97, Lemma 2.1].

Lemma 4.4. [HM97, Lemma 2.1] Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring of dimension d ≥ 1, I
an m-primary ideal and F = {In} be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Let x1, . . . , xk be a
superﬁcial sequence for F. If grade G(F)+ ≥ k then x∗
k is a regular sequence in G(F) and
hence G(F)/(x∗

k) ≃ G(F/(x1, . . . , xk)) where x∗

i is image of xi in G(F).

Proof. By induction it is enough to prove for k = 1. Let (In+1 : x1) ∩ Ic = In for all n ≥ c. Let x∗ ∈
(0 : x∗
+ ∩ G(F)p.
Now x∗z∗ ∈ G(F)n+p and x1xz ∈ In+p+2. Therefore xz ∈ (In+p+2 : x1) ∩ Ic = In+p+1. Thus x∗z∗ = 0
in G(F). Hence x∗ ∈ (0 :G(F ) (G(F)+)c+1) = 0.
(cid:3)

The next theorem was proved for the m-adic by Sally [Sal82, Proposition 3]. We have adapted her

proof for any admissible ﬁltration.

Theorem 4.5. Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1 with inﬁnite residue
ﬁeld, I an m-primary ideal and F = {In} be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Let HR(n) =
λ (In/In+1) and PR(X) ∈ Q[X] such that PR(n) = HR(n) for all large n. Suppose grade G(F)+ ≥
d − 1. Then for a minimal reduction J = (x1, . . . , xd) of F, HR(rJ (F) − d) 6= PR(rJ (F) − d) and
HR(n) = PR(n) for all n ≥ rJ (F) − d + 1.

Proof. We denote rJ (F) by r. We use induction on d. Let d = 1. Without loss of generality we assume
x1 is superﬁcial. Then

G(F )+ (G(F))n = {z∗ ∈ In/In+1 | zIl ∈ In+l+1 for all large l}.

some z ∈ Ik+n/xk
a + b for some
a ∈ In and b ∈ Ik+n+2. Thus b ∈ (x1) ∩ Ik+n+2. Since x1 is superﬁcial, for all large k, b ∈ x1Ik+n+1
and hence z ∈ xk
1In + In+k+1. Thus for all large k, φk is injective. Therefore by Proposition 3.1, for

(4.5.1)

Then for all n ∈ Z,

HR/(x1)(n) = HR(n) − HR(n − 1) and hence PR/(x1)(n) = PR(n) − PR(n − 1).

Since dim R/(x1) = d − 1 and grade G(F/(x1))+ ≥ d − 2, by induction and Lemma 4.2, we have

HR/(x1)(r − d + 1) 6= PR/(x1)(r − d + 1) and HR/(x1)(n) = PR/(x1)(n) for all n ≥ r − d + 2.

Since there exists an integer m, such that for all n ≥ m, PR(n) = HR(n), we have

PR(n − 1) − HR(n − 1) = PR(n) − HR(n) = · · · = PR(n + m) − HR(n + m) = 0 for all n ≥ r − d + 2.

Therefore

0 6= PR/(x1)(r − d + 1) − HR/(x1)(r − d + 1)

= [PR(r − d + 1) − HR(r − d + 1)] − [PR(r − d) − HR(r − d)] = PR(r − d) − HR(r − d).

(cid:3)

The following result is due to Marley [Mar89, Corollary 3.8]. Here we give another proof which

follows from Theorem 4.5.

Theorem 4.6. [Mar89, Corollary 3.8] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
with inﬁnite residue ﬁeld, I an m-primary ideal and F = {In} be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in
R. Let grade G(F)+ ≥ d − 1. Then rJ (F) = n(F) + d for any minimal reduction J of F. In particular,
r(F) = n(F) + d.

Proof. Let HR(n) = λ (In/In+1) for all n and PR(X) ∈ Q[X] such that PR(n) = HR(n) for all large n.
Let d = 1 and J be any minimal reduction of F. Denote rJ (F) by r. Then degree of the polynomial
PR(X) is zero. Hence PR(X) = a where a is a nonzero constant. By Theorem 4.5, for all n ≥ r,
PR(n) = HR(n). Therefore for all n ≥ r, we have

λ(cid:18) R
In(cid:19) = (n − r)a + λ(cid:18) R

Ir(cid:19) = na + (λ(cid:18) R

Ir(cid:19) − ra).

Hence PF (n) = HF (n) for all n ≥ r. Suppose PF (r − 1) = HF (r − 1). Then

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

20

−a + λ(cid:18) R

Ir(cid:19) = λ(cid:18) R

Ir−1(cid:19) .

This implies PR(r − 1) = HR(r − 1) which contradicts Theorem 4.5. Thus rJ (F) − 1 = n(F) for any
minimal reduction J of F. Hence we get the result for d = 1.
Suppose d ≥ 2 and J = (x1, . . . , xd) is a minimal reduction of F consisting of superﬁcial elements.
Denote rJ (F) by r. For all n ∈ Z, we get

HR(n) = HF (n + 1) − HF (n) and hence PR(n) = PF (n + 1) − PF (n).

Since there exists an integer m, such that for all n ≥ m, PF (n) = HF (n), by Theorem 4.5, we have

PF (n) − HF (n) = PF (n + 1) − HF (n + 1) = · · · = PF (n + m) − HF (n + m) = 0 for all n ≥ r − d + 1.

Again using Theorem 4.5, we get

0 6= PR(r − d) − HR(r − d)

= [PF (r − d + 1) − HF (r − d + 1)] − [PF (r − d) − HF (r − d)] = PF (r − d) − HF (r − d).

Thus rJ (F) − d = n(F) for any minimal reduction J of F. Hence r(F) = n(F) + d.

5. Nonnegativity and vanishing of Hilbert coefficients

In this section we apply Grothendieck-Serre formula to derive various properties of the Hilbert

coeﬃcients. We derive a result of Northcott, Narita, Marley and Itoh. We also derive a formula

for the components of local cohomology modules of Rees algebras in terms of the Hilbert coeﬃcients

(Proposition 5.11) which generalises [Sal82, Proposition 5] and [JV95, Proposition 3.3].

The following theorem is a generalisation of a result due to Northcott [Nor60, Theorem 1].

Theorem 5.1. (Northcott’s inequality) Let (R, m) be a d ≥ 1-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring,
I an m-primary ideal and F = {In}n∈Z be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Then

e1(F) ≥ e0(F) − λ(cid:18) R

I1(cid:19) ≥ 0.

Proof. We use induction on d. Let d = 1. Since R is Cohen-Macaulay, putting n = 1 in the Diﬀerence

Formula (Theorem 2.5) for Rees algebra of F, we have

e0(F) − e1(F) − λ(cid:18) R

I1(cid:19) = PF (1) − HF (1)

(R′(F))]1 ≤ 0.

R(F )+

R(F )+ (R′(F))]1 − λR[H 1

R(F )+ (R′(F))]1

= λR[H 0
= −λR[H 1

Thus we get the ﬁrst inequality. Suppose d ≥ 2 and the result is true for rings with dimension upto
d − 1. Without loss of generality we may assume that the residue ﬁeld of R is inﬁnite. Let x ∈ I1 be
a superﬁcial element for F. Then e0(F) = e0(F ′) and e1(F) = e1(F ′) where “ ′ ” denotes the image

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

in R′ = R/(x). Since λ(R′/I ′
For any minimal reduction J of F, J is minimal reduction I1 by [Rees84, Lemma 1.5]. Hence we get
the second inequality.
(cid:3)

1) = λ(R/I1), by induction hypothesis we get the ﬁrst inequality.

Theorem 5.2. [MSV15, Theorem 5.6] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible ﬁltration. Then

(1) eα(F) ≥ 0 where α = (α1, . . . , αs) ∈ Ns, |α| ≥ d − 1.
(2) eα(F) ≥ 0 where α = (α1, . . . , αs) ∈ Ns, |α| = d − 2 and d ≥ 2.

Proof. (1) For |α| = d, the result follows from [Rees84, Theorem 2.4]. Suppose |α| = d − 1. We use

R++

induction on d. Let d = 1. Then putting n = 0 in the Diﬀerence Formula (Theorem 2.5), we get
e0(F) = λR[H 1
(R′(F))]0 ≥ 0. Let d ≥ 2 and assume the result for rings of dimension d − 1. Then
there exists i such that αi ≥ 1. Without loss of generality assume α1 ≥ 1. By Lemma 3.3, there exists
a nonzerodivisor x ∈ I1 such that (x) ∩ F(n) = xF(n − e1) for all n ∈ Ns such that n1 ≫ 0. Let
R′ = R/(x) and F ′ = {F(n)R′}n∈Zs. For all large n, consider the following short exact sequence

Since for all large n, (F(n) : (x)) = F(n − e1), we get PF ′(n) = PF (n) − PF (n − e1). Hence
(−1)d−1−|(α−e1)|b(α−e1)(F ′) = (−1)d−|α|eα(F) where

PF ′(n) = Xγ=(γ1,...,γs)∈Ns

Since |(α − e1)| = d − 2 = (d − 1) − 1, by induction b(α−e1)(F ′) ≥ 0. Hence for |α| = d − 1, eα(F) ≥ 0.
(2) We prove the result using induction on d. For d = 2 the result follows from the Diﬀerence Formula

(Theorem 2.5) for n = 0 and Proposition 3.5. The rest is same as for the case |α| = d − 1.

(cid:3)

As a consequence of this we get the following results which is proved by Marley [Mar89, Proposition

3.19, Proposition 3.23]. The next one is a generalisation of a result due to M. Narita [Nar63, Theorem

1]. Here we give diﬀerent proof.

Proposition 5.3. Let (R, m) be a d-dimensional (d ≥ 2) Cohen-Macaulay local ring, I an m-primary
ideal and F = {I n}n∈Z an admissible I-ﬁltration. Then e2(F) ≥ 0.

Proof. Comparing the expressions of coeﬃcients of Hilbert polynomials for s = 1 and s ≥ 2, by

Theorem 5.2, we get the required result.

(cid:3)

It is natural to ask whether ei(F) are nonnegative for i ≥ 3 in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. Narita
[Nar63, Theorem 2] and Marley [Marley89, Example 2] gave an example of an ideal in a Cohen-
Macaulay local ring with e3(I) < 0.

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

22

Example 5.4. [Nar63, Theorem 2] Let ∆ be a formal power series k[[X1, X2, X3, X4]] over a ﬁeld k
and Q = ∆/∆X 3
4 . Then Q is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension 3. Let x1, x2, x3, x4 be the
images of X1, X2, X3, X4 in Q and I = Qx1 + Qx2

3 + Qx2x4 + Qx3x4. Then

2 + Qx2

e3(I) = −λQ′(cid:18)((IQ′)2 : (x2Q′)2)

IQ′

(cid:19) = −λQ′(cid:18) IQ′ + (x4Q′)2

IQ′

(cid:19) < 0 where Q′ = Q/(x1).

Example 5.5. [Marley89, Example 2] Let I = (X 3, Y 3, Z 3, X 2Y, XY 2, Y Z 2, XY Z) in the regular
local ring R = k[X, Y, Z](X,Y,Z). Then for all n ≥ 1,

PI (n) = 27(cid:18)n + 2

3 (cid:19) − 18(cid:18)n + 1

2 (cid:19) + 4n + 1.

Hence e3(I) = −1 < 0.

However, for F = {I n}n∈Z, Itoh proved that e3(F) is nonnegative in an analytically unramiﬁed
Cohen-Macaulay local ring [Ito92, Theorem 3]. In order to prove this, he used an analogue of Theorem

2.3 (see [Ito92, p. 114]). In [HH99, Corollary 3.9], authors gave an alternative proof of this result. We

prove this result using the GSF. For this purpose, we recall some results of Itoh about vanishing of

graded components of local cohomology modules. See also [HU, Theorem 1.2].

Theorem 5.6. [Ito88, Theorem 2] [Ito92, Proposition 13] Let (R, m) be an analytically unramiﬁed
Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 2. Let M = (t−1, R(F)+) be the maximal homogeneous
ideal of R′(F). Then the following statements hold true for the ﬁltration F = {I n}n∈Z :
(1) H 0
(2) H 2
(3) H i

M(R′(F)) = H 1
M(R′(F)j = 0 for j ≤ 0;
M(R′(F)) = H i

M(R′(F)) = 0;

R(F )+

Theorem 5.7. [Ito92, Theorem 3] Let (R, m) be an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local ring
of dimension d ≥ 3 and I be an m-primary ideal in R. Then e3(I) ≥ 0.

Proof. For F = {I n}n∈Z, we set R′(I) := R′(F). We use induction on d. Let d = 3. Then, by the
Diﬀerence Formula (Theorem 2.5) for Rees algebras and Theorem 5.6, we have

e3(I) = h3

R′ (I)+

R′(I)0 ≥ 0.

Let d > 3. We may assume that the residue ﬁeld of R is inﬁnite. Let J ⊆ I be a reduction of I.
Since I n = J n for all n, ei(I) = ei(J) for all i = 1, . . . , d. Therefore it suﬃces to show that e3(J) ≥ 0.
By [Ito92, Theorem 1 and Corollary 8], there exists a system of generators x1, . . . , xd of J such that,
i=1 xiTi), then C is an analytically
unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d − 1 and e3(J) = e3(JC). Hence, by using
induction hypothesis the result follows.
(cid:3)

if we put T = (T1, . . . , Td), R(T ) = R[T ]m[T ] and C = R(T )/(Pd

Itoh [Ito92, p. 116] proposed the following conjecture on the vanishing of e3(I) which is still open.

GROTHENDIECK-SERRE FORMULA

23

Conjecture 5.8. (Itoh’s Conjecture): Let (R, m) be an analytically unramiﬁed Gorenstein local ring
of dimension d ≥ 3. Then e3(I) = 0 if and only if I n+2 = I nI 2 for every n ≥ 0.

Itoh proved the “if” part of the Conjecture 5.8 in [Ito88, Proposition 10]. He also proved the “only

if” part of the Conjecture 5.8 for I = m [Ito92, Theorem 3(2)]. By [Ito92, Corollary 8 and Proposition
17], it suﬃces to prove the Conjecture 5.8 for d = 3. Let d = 3 and e3(I) = 0 for an m-primary ideal in
a Cohen-Macaulay ring R. By [Ito88, Proposition 3] and [Ito92, Corollary 16 and (4.1)], I n+2 = I nI 2
for every n ≥ 0 if and only if R′(I) is Cohen-Macaulay.

It is not known whether the Itoh’s conjecture is true for I = m in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring

R (which need not be Gorenstein). Recently, in [CPR14, Theorem 3.6], the authors proved that the

Conjecture 5.8 holds true for I = m in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of type at most two. T. T. Phuong

[P15], showed that if R is an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 2
then the equality e1(I) = e0(I) − λ(R/I) + 1 leads to the vanishing of e3(I) = 0. In [KM15], authors
generalised the result of [CPR14]. They also obtained following result for an arbitrary m-primary ideal

I in an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension 3.

Theorem 5.9. [KM15, Theorem 1.1] Let (R, m) be an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local
ring of dimension 3. Let M = (t−1, R′

by x, y, z. If R′ is not Cohen-Macaulay, then e2(I) − λ  I 2

(x, y, z)I! ≥ 3.

As a consequence they generalised [CPR14, Theorem 3.6].

Corollary 5.10. [KM15, Corollary 1.2] Let (R, m) be an analytically unramiﬁed Cohen-Macaulay local

ring of dimension 3.

(1) Suppose e3(I) = 0. Then there is an inclusion H 3

6. Huneke-Ooishi Theorem and a multi-graded version

In this section we give an application of the GSF to derive a result of Huneke [Hun87] and Ooishi

[O87] which states that if (R, m) is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1 and I is an
m-primary ideal then e0(I) − e1(I) = λ(R/I) if and only if r(I) ≤ 1. A similar result for admissible
ﬁltrations was proved in [Bla97, Theorem 4.3.6] and [HM97, Corollary 4.9]. In [MSV15, Theorem 5.5],

authors gave a partial generalization of this result for an I-admissible ﬁltration. First we prove few

preliminary results needed.

Lemma 6.1. (Sally machine)[Sal79, Corollary 2.4] [HM97, Lemma 2.2] Let (R, m) be a Noetherian
local ring, I1 an m-primary ideal in R and F = {In}n∈Z be an I1-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Let
x1, . . . , xr be a superﬁcial sequence for F. If grade G(F/(x1, . . . , xr))+ ≥ 1 then grade G(F)+ ≥ r + 1.

Proof. We use induction on r. Let r = 1 and y ∈ It such that image of y in G(F/(x1))t is a nonzero-
divisor. Then (In+tj : yj) ⊆ (In, x1) for all n, j. Since x1 is a superﬁcial element for F, there exists
integer c ≥ 0, such that (In+j : xj
1) ∩ Ic = In for all j ≥ 1 and n ≥ c. Consider an integer p > c/t. For
arbitrary n and j ≥ 1, we prove that

yp(In+j : xj

1) ⊆ (In+j+tp : xj

1) ∩ Ic = In+tp.

Let a ∈ (In+j : xj

1). Then aypxj

1 ∈ In+j+tp. Since pt > c, ayp ∈ (In+j+tp : xj

1) ∩ Ic = In+tp. Therefore

Thus (In+j : xj

1) = In + x1(In+j : xj+1

1

) for all n and j ≥ 1. Iterating this formula n times, we get

(In+j : xj

1) ⊆ (In+tp : yp) ⊆ (In, x1).

(In+j : xj

1) = In + x1In−1 + x2

1In−2 + · · · + xn

1 (In+j : xj+n

1

) = In.

1 = x1 + I2 is a nonzerodivisor of G(F). Since G(F)/(x∗

Hence x∗
Now assume r ≥ 2. Then by r = 1 case, we have grade G(F/(x1, . . . , xr−1))+ ≥ 2 > 1. By induction
on r, we have grade G(F)+ ≥ r and since x1, . . . , xr is a superﬁcial sequence for F, by Lemma 4.4,
we obtain x∗
1, . . . , x∗
r) ≃ G(F/(x1, . . . , xr)),
grade G(F)+ ≥ r + 1.
(cid:3)

r is a regular sequence of G(F). Since G(F)/(x∗

1) ≃ G(F/(x1)), grade G(F)+ ≥ 2.

1, . . . , x∗

The next lemma is due to Marley [Mar89, Lemma 3.14].

Lemma 6.2. Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1, I an m-primary ideal
and F = {In}n∈Z be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in R. Suppose x ∈ I1 \ I2 such that x∗ = x + I2
is a nonzerodivisor in G(F). Let R′ = R/(x). Then n(F) = n(F ′) − 1 where F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z.

Proof. We use the notation “ ′ ” to denote the image in R′. For all n, consider the following short
exact sequence of R-modules

0 −→ (In : x)/In −→ R/In

.x−→ R/In −→ R′/I ′

n −→ 0.

n) = λ((In : x)/In). Since x∗ is a nonzerodivisor in G(F), we have (In+1 :
Therefore HF ′(n) = λ(R′/I ′
x) = In for all n. Hence HF ′(n) = λ(In−1/In) = λ(R/In) − λ(R/In−1) = HF (n) − HF (n − 1) for all
n which implies PF ′(n) = PF (n) − PF (n − 1) for all n. Thus HF ′(n) = PF ′(n) for all n ≥ n(F) + 2.
Since

PF ′(n(F) + 1) − HF ′(n(F) + 1) = [PF (n(F) + 1) − HF (n(F) + 1)] − [PF (n(F)) − HF (n(F))]

= −[PF (n(F)) − HF (n(F))] 6= 0,

we get the required result.

(cid:3)

The next theorem is due to Blancafort [Bla97] which is a generalization of a result of Huneke [Hun87]

and Ooish [O87] proved independently. We make use of reduction number and postulation number of

admissible ﬁltration of ideals to simplify her proof.

Theorem 6.3. [Bla97, Theorem 4.3.6] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring with inﬁnite residue
ﬁeld of dimension d ≥ 1, I1 an m-primary ideal and F = {In}n∈Z be an I1-admissible ﬁltration of
ideals in R. Then the following are equivalent:

(1) e0(F) − e1(F) = λ (R/I1) ,
(2) r(F) ≤ 1.

In this case, e2(F) = · · · = ed(F) = 0, G(F) is Cohen-Macaulay, n(F) ≤ 0, r(F) is independent of
the reduction chosen and F = {I n

1 }.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) We use induction on d. Let d = 1. For all n ∈ Z, we have

PF (n) − HF (n) = −h1

R(F )+ (R′(F))n.

By putting n = 1 in this formula, we get e0(F) − e1(F) − λ (R/I1) = −h1
by Lemma 3.8, for all n ≥ 1, h1

(R′(F))1 = 0. Therefore
R′(F)n = 0. Consider the short exact sequence of R(F)-modules,

where φk(z) = xz.

For all large k, Ik+n+1 = xIk+n. Hence for all large k, φk is surjective. Now suppose φk(z) = 0 for
some z ∈ Ik+n/xkIn. Then xz ∈ xk+1In. Therefore xz = xk+1a where a ∈ In, hence z ∈ xkIn. Thus
for all large k, φk is injective. Therefore by Proposition 3.2, for all large k,

By Lemma 3.8 and Proposition 2.4, H 1

R(F )+

(R(F))n = 0 for all n ≥ 1. Then for all large k and n ≥ 1,

Ik+n = xkIn.

Let a ∈ Ik+n−1. Then xa ∈ Ik+n ⊆ xkIn implies a ∈ xk−1In. Thus Ik+n−1 = xk−1In. Using this
procedure repeatedly we get In+1 = xIn. Thus r(F) ≤ 1.
Let d ≥ 2 and x ∈ I1 be a superﬁcial element for F. Let R′ = R/(x), F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z and G′ = G(F ′).
Since ei(F) = ei(F ′) for all i < d, we have

e0(F ′) − e1(F ′) = e0(F) − e1(F) = λ(cid:18) R

I1(cid:19) = λ(cid:18) R′

I1R′(cid:19) .

Hence by induction hypothesis, G′ is Cohen-Macaulay. Therefore by Sally machine (Lemma 6.1),
G(F) is Cohen-Macaulay. This implies that for any minimal reduction J of F, rJ (F) = n(F) + d by
Theorem 4.6. Thus rJ (F) is independent of the minimal reduction J of I. Let J be a minimal reduction
of F generated by superﬁcial sequence x1, . . . , xd. Let R = R/(x1, . . . , xd−1) and F = {InR}n∈Z. Since
G(F) is Cohen-Macaulay and x1, . . . , xd is superﬁcial, using Theorem 4.6 and Lemmas 4.4, 4.2 and
6.2, for d − 1 times, by induction hypothesis we get

r(F) = n(F) + d = n(F ) + 1 = r(F) ≤ 1.

d is nonzerodivisor, (In+1R′ : x′

d) = InR′ for all n ≥ 1. Therefore (x′

(2) ⇒ (1) Let J be a minimal reduction of F such that r(F) = rJ (F) and J is generated by superﬁcial
sequence x1, . . . , xd. Let R′ = R/(x1, . . . , xd−1) and F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z. Then xdInR′ = In+1R′ for all
d)∗ (the image of
n ≥ 1. Since x′
d in G(F ′)) is nonzerodivisor in G(F ′). Hence G(F ′) is Cohen-Macaulay. Thus by Lemma 6.1, G(F)
x′
is Cohen-Macaulay. Therefore by Theorem 4.6, n(F) = r(F) − d ≤ 0. Hence PF (n) = HF (n) for all
n > 0. By putting n = 1 for d = 1 case we obtain e0(F) − e1(F) = λ(R/I1).
Now we prove that if r(F) ≤ 1 then e2(F) = · · · = ed(F) = 0. Without loss of generality assume
d ≥ 2. The condition r(F) ≤ 1 implies G(F) is Cohen-Macaulay and n(F) = r(F) − d < 0. Let
d = 2. Therefore e2(F) = PF (0) − HF (0) = 0. Now assume d ≥ 3 and the result is true upto
dimension d − 1. Let J be minimal reduction of F generated by superﬁcial sequence x1, . . . , xd. Let
R′ = R/(x1, . . . , xd−1) and F ′ = {InR′}n∈Z. Then ei(F) = ei(F ′) = 0 for all 0 ≤ i < d. Since G(F)
is Cohen-Macaulay and n(F) = r(F) − d < 0, we get (−1)ded(F) = PF (0) − HF (0) = 0. Therefore
e0(F) − e1(F) − λ (R/I1) = PF (1) − HF (1) = 0.
Let J be a minimal reduction of F such that r(F) = rJ (F) and r(F) ≤ 1. Then I2 = JI1 ⊆ I 2

Theorem 6.4. [MSV15, Theorem 5.5] Let (R, m) be a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d ≥ 1
and I1, . . . , Is be m-primary ideals of R. Let F = {F(n)}n∈Zs be an I-admissible ﬁltration of ideals in
R. Then for all i = 1, . . . , s,

(2) e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) ≤ λ(R/F(ei)),
(3) e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) = λ(R/F(ei)) if and only if r(F (i)) ≤ 1 and e(d−1)ei (F) = e1(F (i)).

Proof. (1) We apply induction on d. Let d = 1. Then by Theorem 2.5,

PF (rei) − λ(R/F(rei)) = −λR[H 1

R++(R′(F))](rei) for all r ≥ 0.

Since F (i) is Ii-admissible, we have e(F (i)) = e(Ii). Hence using PF (i)(r) = e(Ii)r − e1(F (i)), we get

PF (i)(r) − λ(R/F(rei)) + [e1(F (i)) − e0(F)] = −λR[H 1

R++(R′(F))](rei) ≤ 0.

Taking r ≫ 0, we get e0(F) ≥ e1(F (i)). Let d ≥ 2. Without loss of generality we may assume that
the residue ﬁeld of R is inﬁnite. By Lemma 3.3, there exists a nonzerodivisor xi ∈ Ii such that

(xi) ∩ F(n) = xiF(n − ei) for n ∈ Ns where ni ≫ 0.

Let R′ = R/(xi) and F ′ = {F(n)R′} and F ′(i) = {F(nei)R′}. For all n ∈ Ns such that ni ≫ 0,
consider the following exact sequence

R

Since for all n ∈ Ns where ni ≫ 0, (F(n) : (xi)) = F(n − ei), we get HF ′(n) = HF (n) − HF (n − ei)
and hence PF (n) − PF (n − ei) = PF ′(n). Therefore e(d−2)ei (F ′) = e(d−1)ei (F) and e1(F ′(i)) = e1(F (i)).
Therefore by induction, the result follows.

(2) Using part (1), for all i = 1, . . . , s, we have

e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) ≤ e(Ii) − e1(F (i)) ≤ λ(R/F(ei))

where the last inequality follows from Theorem 5.1.
(3) Let e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) = λ(R/F(ei)). Then by part (1),

λ(R/F(ei)) = e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei (F) ≤ e(Ii) − e1(F (i)) ≤ λ(R/F(ei)),

where the last inequality follows by Theorem 5.1. Hence e(d−1)ei (F) = e1(F (i)) and e(Ii) − e1(F (i)) =
λ(R/F(ei)). Therefore, by Theorem 6.3, r(F (i)) ≤ 1.
Conversely, suppose r(F (i)) ≤ 1 and e(d−1)ei (F) = e1(F (i)). Again, by Theorem 6.3, e(Ii) − e1(F (i)) =
λ(R/F(ei)). Hence e(Ii) − e(d−1)ei(F) = λ(R/F(ei)).

follows.
(3) ⇒ (2′) : Put n = 1 in (3).
(2′) ⇒ (2) Consider the ﬁltration F = {I n}n∈Z. Then by [Bla97, Proposition 3.2.3], for all n ≥ 0,

(2) ⇒ (1) : Follows from [Hun87, Theorem 2.1].
(1) ⇒ (4) : Let F = {I n}n∈Z. Since ˘F is an I-admissible ﬁltration, the result follows by Theorem
6.5.
