Abstract

This work presents and studies Riccati equations over ﬁnite-dimensional normed
division algebras. We prove that a Riccati equation over a ﬁnite-dimensional normed
division algebra A is a particular case of conformal Riccati equation on an Euc-
lidean space and it can be considered as a curve in a Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds
V (cid:39) so(dim A + 1, 1). Previous results on known types of Riccati equations are re-
covered from a new viewpoint. A new type of Riccati equations, the octonionic Ric-
cati equations, are extended to the octonionic projective line OP1. As a new phys-
ical application, quaternionic Riccati equations are applied to study quaternionic
Schr¨odinger equations on 1+1 dimensions.

Keywords: Lie system, normed division algebra, octonion, quaternion quantum mech-
anics, Riccati equation, Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra.

Introduction

The Riccati equations [32, 50], namely the diﬀerential equations1

= a(t) + b(t)x + c(t)x2,

x ∈ R,

dx
dt

(1.1)

with a(t), b(t), c(t) being arbitrary t-dependent real functions, play a very relevant rˆole in
physics and mathematics [8, 44, 55]. Despite its apparent simplicity, the general solution
of a Riccati equation for arbitrary a(t), b(t) and c(t) cannot be obtained by quadratures
[32]. This has led to devise many methods to solve them (see e.g. [42, 48]).

The general solution, x(t), of a Riccati equation (1.1) can be brought into the form

x(t) =

x1(t)(x3(t) − x2(t)) + kx2(t)(x3(t) − x1(t))

x3(t) − x2(t) + k(x3(t) − x1(t))

,

(1.2)

1It is sometimes assumed a(t)c(t) (cid:54)= 0. This condition does not change our main results and it only

makes some proofs unnecessarily more technical.

1

where x1(t), x2(t), x3(t) are diﬀerent particular solutions to (1.1) and k ∈ R (see [13, 15,
32, 59]). This allows us to analyse the general solution of a Riccati equation in terms of
just three particular ones. For instance, it follows from (1.2) that all particular solutions
to a Riccati equation are periodic if and only if the Riccati equation has three periodic
particular solutions. Additionally, (1.2) enables us to simplify the numerical analysis of
Riccati equations [59].

Expression (1.2) shows that Riccati equations are Lie systems [51]. Indeed, recall that
a Lie system is a nonautonomous (t-dependent) system of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential
equations whose general solution can be written as a t-independent function, the super-
position rule, of a set of particular solutions and some constants [13, 51, 59]. In view of
(1.2), the general solution of (1.1) reads x(t) = Φ(x(1)(t), x(2)(t), x(3)(t), k), where

and

Φ : R3 × R (cid:51) (x(1), x(2), x(3), k) (cid:55)→ x ∈ R,

x :=

x(1)(x(3) − x(2)) + kx(2)(x(3) − x(1))

x(3) − x(2) + k(x(3) − x(1))

.

The above expression is the most well-known example of nonlinear superposition rule [32].
This turns Riccati equations into Lie systems.

The Lie–Scheﬀers Theorem [15, 51] establishes when a system of ﬁrst-order ordinary
diﬀerential equations in normal form is a Lie system. It also states that every Lie system
amounts to a curve within a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds: a Vessiot–
Guldberg Lie algebra [13, 15]. Lie proved that every such a Lie algebra on the real line is
locally diﬀeomorphic around a generic point to a Lie subalgebra of (cid:104)∂x, x∂x, x2∂x(cid:105) [29, 41].
This explains geometrically why the general solution of a Riccati equation can be expressed
in the form (1.2).

Several generalisations of the Riccati equations have appeared over the years [38, 39,

58]. For instance, research has been performed on the complex Riccati equations [40]

= a(t) + b(t)z + c(t)z2,

z ∈ C,

dz
dt

(1.3)

with a(t), b(t) and c(t) being arbitrary complex t-dependent functions. Some works
have been devoted to studying their periodic solutions [12] and applications in physics
[16, 17, 20, 36, 53].

Riccati equations were lately generalised to the realm of quaternionic numbers H by

deﬁning [58]:

= a(t) + b(t)q + qc(t) + qd(t)q,

q ∈ H.

dq
dt

(1.4)

In this case, a(t), b(t), c(t), d(t) are arbitrary t-dependent quaternionic-valued functions.
These equations have been studied mathematically in [58]. Other quaternionic generaliz-
ations of Riccati equations have found applications in ﬂuids physics and reducing multidi-
mensional Schr¨odinger equations [38, 39]. As far as the authors know, we here provide the

2

ﬁrst physical application of (1.4) by showing that these equations appear in the so-called
quaternionic quantum mechanics [25, 27, 35]. Particular cases of quaternionic Riccati
equations, e.g. linear ones, appear in [28].

As Riccati equations over R and C have quadratic terms, it is reasonable that their
generalization to quaternions should also content such a term. Since quaternions are not
commutative, the quadratic term in (1.4) is not uniquely determined: we could also have
d(t)q2 or/and q2d(t) [58]. A reason to use qd(t)q is that (1.4) has an analytic extension
to the one-point compactiﬁcation, ¯H, of quaternions [58].

As a ﬁrst main result, this work introduces a new generalization of Riccati equations
to the space O of octonionic numbers: the octonionic Riccati equations. Since the Hurwitz
Theorem [49] states that every ﬁnite-dimensional normed division algebra is isomorphic
to R, C, H or O and we have a natural embedding of normed division algebras R ⊂
C ⊂ H ⊂ O, then octonionic Riccati equations retrieve Riccati equations over R, C, H as
particular cases.

We prove that octonionic Riccati equations are Lie systems. The lack of commutativity
of octonions leads to several other possible deﬁnitions of octonionic Riccati equations, but
we show that they do not lead to Lie systems. As a by-product we demonstrate that the
same occurs with the alternative deﬁnitions of quaternionic Riccati equations proposed
in [58] giving rise to a second reason to deﬁne quaternionic Riccati equations as in (1.4).
We deﬁne Riccati equations over ﬁnite-dimensional normed division algebras (NDA
Riccati equations) and we prove that they can be considered as sub-cases of conformal
Riccati equations. This leads to show that a Riccati equation over a ﬁnite-dimensional
normed division algebra A admits a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra, VA, of conformal vector
ﬁelds with respect to a Euclidean metric and VA (cid:39) so(dim A + 1, 1), where so(p, q) stands
for the Lie algebra of the indeﬁnite special orthogonal group SO(p, q) (see [31] for details).
Importantly, Lie algebras so(p, 1) are simple Lie algebras [56, 57] and VA is the smallest
common Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra for all Riccati equations over A. These results are
resumed in Table 1.

Since Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebras of NDA Riccati equations become extremely
large, standard diﬀerential and algebraic methods for studying Lie algebras, e.g.
the
Killing form, become highly ineﬃcient. Instead, we use diﬀerential calculus over normed
division algebras and conformal geometry.

The fact that NDA Riccati equations are Lie systems allows for the use of many
techniques to describe their general solutions, superposition rules, constants of motion,
geometric invariants, Lie symmetries, etcetera [4, 9, 26]. It is worth noting that geometric
techniques, e.g. symplectic, Poisson, k-symplectic or Jacobi structures, may be applied
to study their properties [7, 22, 23, 30].
It is well known that Riccati equations can be described as a projection of a linear
system on R2× := R2\{(0, 0)} (see [32] for details). We extend this result to the octonionic
Riccati equations and ﬁnd that they can also be extended to the octonionic projective

3

line. A similar result applies for all NDA Riccati equations.

Table 1: Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebras for NDA Riccati equations. We write conf(Rn) for the ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie algebra of conformal vector ﬁelds of the Euclidean space Rn.

Subsequently, the study of the existence of Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebras of Hamilto-
nian vector ﬁelds for particular types of octonionic and quaternionic Riccati equations is
addressed. The Lie algebras of associated Hamiltonian functions are given, which can be
useful to obtain in a geometric way their superposition rules with the so-called co-algebra
method and to study further their properties and constants of motion [7].

The structure of the paper goes as follows. Section 2 is devoted to describing the
fundamental properties of ﬁnite-dimensional normed division algebras. Conformal vector
ﬁelds and M¨obius transformations are brieﬂy presented in Section 3. Section 4 introduces
the most important properties of Lie systems. We deﬁne octonionic Riccati equations and
NDA Riccati equations in Section 5. In Section 6 it is proved that NDA Riccati equations
are a particular type of conformal Riccati equations. We show that other alternative
deﬁnitions of octonionic and quaternionic Riccati equations are not Lie systems in Section
7. In Section 8 we prove that NDA Riccati equations can be recovered as the projection of
a linear system. As a by-product, we show that NDA Riccati equations can be extended
to projective lines over normed division algebras. In Section 9, we study the existence of
symplectic structures turning types of NDA Riccati equations into Lie–Hamilton systems,
i.e. Lie systems with a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds relative
to a Poisson structure [14]. Section 10 shows that quaternionic Riccati equations appear
in the study of the so-called quaternionic Schr¨odinger equations. Finally, Section 11
summarises the work and gives some future lines of research.

2 Normed division algebras

Let us survey the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional normed division algebras to recall some
results to be used hereafter. We also detail an intermediate result, Lemma 2.5, which
allows us to use algebraic techniques to study diﬀerential geometric properties of NDA
Riccati equations.

Deﬁnition 2.1. (See [6, 24, 49]) We call normed division algebra a ﬁnite-dimensio-
nal R-algebra A equipped with a unit, 1, and a norm (cid:107) · (cid:107) : A → [0, +∞[ such that
(cid:107)ab(cid:107) = (cid:107)a(cid:107)(cid:107)b(cid:107),∀a, b ∈ A.

Example 2.2. The space of octonions, O, is an 8-
dimensional normed division algebra. Its construction
goes as follows. Given a basis {eα}α=0,...,7 of O, every
α=0 oαeα, with oα ∈ R. The
bilinear multiplication on O is determined by the mul-
tiplication on the elements of our basis, which is given
by the Fano diagram aside (see [6] for details), and the
:= −1, for i = 1, . . . , 7 and e0 := 1. We

it into a normed division algebra.

Theorem 2.3. (Hurwitz’s theorem [6, 24, 49]) All normed division algebras are iso-
morphic to R, C, H or O.

A normed division algebra A admits an inner product g : A × A → R

g(a, b) :=

(cid:107)a + b(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)a(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)b(cid:107)2

2

,

∀a, b ∈ A.

From its non-degeneracy, it follows that

[∀c ∈ A,

g(a, c) = g(b, c)] =⇒ a = b.

(2.1)
The space A can be equipped with the so-called conjugation ∗ : A (cid:51) a (cid:55)→ a∗ := 2g(a, 1) −
a ∈ A, where g(a, 1) is understood as g(a, 1)1. Observe that aa∗ = a∗a = (cid:107)a(cid:107)2. Then,
a ∈ A\{0} has inverse a−1 := a∗/(cid:107)a(cid:107)2.
i = −ei for i = 1, . . . , 7. Thus,
Example 2.4. In the case of the octonions, e∗
every o ∈ O can be written in a unique way as o = o0 + ¯o, where o0 := [o∗ + o]/2 ∈ R is
called the scalar part of o and ¯o := [o − o∗]/2 is referred to as its vectorial part. Hence,
∗ : O (cid:51) o0 + ¯o (cid:55)→ o0 − ¯o ∈ O.

0 = e0 and e∗

Octonions form a particular type of composition algebra [19, 34]. Therefore, they

satisfy the following laws:

g(ab, ac) = (cid:107)a(cid:107)2g(b, c),

g(ac, bc) = g(a, b)(cid:107)c(cid:107)2,

g(ab, cd) = 2g(a, c)g(b, d) − g(ad, cb),
g(ab, c) = g(a, cb∗),

g(ab, c) = g(b, a∗c),

(scaling),

(exchange),

(braid),

(inverse),

a∗(ab) = (cid:107)a(cid:107)2b = (ba)a∗,
a(ab) = a2b,

(ba)a = ba2,

a−1(ab) = b = (ba)a−1,

a(ba) = (ab)a,

(alternative),

(ab)(ca) = [a(bc)]a, a[b(ac)] = [(ab)a]c, [(ba)c]a = b[a(ca)], (Moufang).

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

Although octonions are non-commutative and non-associative, they are alternative in
view of (2.6) and the subalgebra generated by any two non-simultaneously zero octonions
is isomorphic either to R, C or H, which are associative. In view of this and Hurwitz’s
Theorem, we can frequently restrict our considerations to octonions - the most general
normed division algebra.

Using (2.3), (2.4) and since g(ei, ej) = 0 for 1 ≤ i (cid:54)= j ≤ 7, we get that
g(ei(ejo), ˆo) = −g(ejo, eiˆo) = −2g(ej, ei)g(o, ˆo) + g(ej ˆo, eio) = g(−ej(eio), ˆo),
g((oei)ej, ˆo) = −g(oei, ˆoej) = −2g(ei, ej)g(o, ˆo) + g(oej, ˆoei) = g(−(oej)ei, ˆo),

for all o, ˆo ∈ O. Hence,

ei(ejo) = −ej(eio),

(oei)ej = −(oej)ei,

1 ≤ i (cid:54)= j ≤ 7.

(2.8)

Every normed division algebra forms a normed vector space over the reals. Thus, A
becomes a complete metric space relative to d(a1, a2) := (cid:107)a1 − a2(cid:107), where a1, a2 ∈ A.
Since normed division algebras are isomorphic to a certain Rs as vector spaces, they can
then be understood as diﬀerentiable manifolds.

The next trivial lemma will be useful in following sections.

Lemma 2.5. Given smooth curves a(1)(t), a(2)(t), a(3)(t) in A with (cid:107)a(3)(t)(cid:107) (cid:54)= 0 for every
t ∈ R, we have

d

[a(1)(t)a(2)(t)] =

(3)(t).

Similarly, ∇u(F1F2) = (∇uF1)F2 + F1(∇uF2), where F1, F2 : A → A and (∇uG)(a) is the
directional derivative in the direction u ∈ A of the function G : A → A at a ∈ A.

We now give the general procedure of projective lines of normed division algebras.
This structure will be used to relate NDA Riccati equations to mostly linear systems of
diﬀerential equations (we refer to [6] for details).

Given (a1, a2) ∈ A2× := A2\{(0, 0)}, we deﬁne the equivalence relation
(a1, a2) ∼ (˜a1, ˜a2), a2 (cid:54)= 0 ⇔ ∃λ ∈ A\{0} : (˜a1, ˜a2) = ((a1a−1
(a1, a2) ∼ (˜a1, ˜a2), a1 (cid:54)= 0 ⇔ ∃λ ∈ A\{0} : (˜a1, ˜a2) = (λ, (a2a−1

2 )λ, λ),
1 )λ).

(2.9)

The above equivalence relation is well deﬁned. Indeed, for points (a1, a2) with a1a2 (cid:54)= 0
both possibilities in (2.9) are equivalent due to the inverse laws. The quotient space,
AP1 := A2×/ ∼, is the so-called A-projective line and [a1 : a2] stands for the equivalence
class related to (a1, a2). The AP1 is a diﬀerentiable manifold with the diﬀerentiable

6

structure induced by the atlas given through the charts ψ2 : D2 (cid:51) [a1 : 1] (cid:55)→ a1 ∈ A (cid:39) Rs
and ψ1 : D1 (cid:51) [1 : a2] (cid:55)→ a2 ∈ A (cid:39) Rs, with D2 := {[a1 : 1] ∈ AP1 : a1 ∈ A} and
D1 := {[1 : a2] ∈ AP1 : a2 ∈ A}. The transition map between these charts, φA : ψ1(D1 ∩
D2) (cid:51) a (cid:55)→ a−1 ∈ ψ2(D1∩D2), is a diﬀeomorphism because 0 /∈ ψ1(D1∩D2)∪ψ2(D1∩D2).
Let us also prove that the associated canonical projection map πA : A2× → AP1 is
smooth. Consider the charts Ψi : p ∈ Ui ⊂ A2× (cid:55)→ (a1, a2) ∈ A × A (cid:39) R2s, where
Ui := {(a1, a2) ∈ A2 : ai (cid:54)= 0} for i = 1, 2. Since πA(Ui) = Di, the local expressions for πA
read

(cid:40)

ψi ◦ πA ◦ Ψ−1

i

: Ψi(Ui) → ψi(Di);

ψi ◦ πA ◦ Ψ−1

i (a1, a2) :=

a2a−1
1 ,
a1a−1
2 ,

i = 1,
i = 2.

This mapping is well deﬁned and smooth.

The previous construction can be simpliﬁed for associative normed division algebras,
e.g. quaternions. In this case, the projective line can be deﬁned simply by considering
A2× := A2\{(0, 0)} and the equivalence relation

(a1, a2) ∼ (˜a1, ˜a2) ⇐⇒ ∃λ ∈ A\{0} : (˜a1, ˜a2) = (λa1, λa2).

3 Conformal vector ﬁelds and transformations

Let us state some facts on conformal geometry to be used hereafter.
Deﬁnition 3.1. (See [52]) Let (N, g) and (N(cid:48), g(cid:48)) be Riemannian manifolds and dim N =
dim N(cid:48). The mapping ϕ : U ⊂ N → V ⊂ N(cid:48) of maximal rank is a conformal transform-
ation if there exists a function fϕ : U → R>0, the conformal factor of ϕ, satisfying
ϕ∗g(cid:48) = f 2

ϕg.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let (N, g) be a Riemannian manifold. A vector ﬁeld X on N is conformal
vector ﬁeld relative to g when LXg = fXg for a certain fX ∈ C∞(N ) with LX being the
Lie derivative relative to X. The function fX is called the potential of X. A Killing
vector ﬁeld is a conformal vector ﬁeld with zero potential.

Conformal vector ﬁelds on (N, g) form a Lie algebra, its conformal Lie algebra, denoted
by conf(N, g) and conformal transformations form a Lie group denoted by Conf(N, g). In
this work we are mainly interested in Euclidean spaces on N = Rn, for n = 1, 2, 4 and 8.
Hence, if a metric is given, we will assume it to be Euclidean.

The conformal Lie algebra in the plane is known to be inﬁnite-dimensional [37, p.
27]. In this case, we write conf(R2) for the ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of conformal
vector ﬁelds associated to global (up to a unique singular point) orientation-preserving
conformal transformations. We have the Lie algebra isomorphisms (cf.
[37, p. 21])
conf(Rn) (cid:39) so(n + 1, 1), where so(n + 1, 1) is the indeﬁnite special orthogonal Lie algebra

7

related to the metric on Rn+2 with signature (n+1, 1). It is worth noting that the conf(Rn)
are maximal in the Lie algebra of polynomial vector ﬁelds on Rn and simple [10].

It is well known that global (up to a unique singular point) orientation-preserving
conformal transformations on the complex plane are the referred to as M¨obius transform-
ations [52, p. 32], namely

C (cid:51) z (cid:55)→ αz + β
γz + δ

∈ C,

αδ − βγ = 1, α, β, γ, δ ∈ C.

M¨obius transformations form a group, called the M¨obius group Mb(C), which is isomorphic
to P SL(2, C) := SL(2, C)/Z2 [47]. There is a link between conformal mappings, Lorentz
transformations and spinor transformations for complex numbers [47]. This was gener-
alized by Manogue and Drey to normed division algebras [43]. In particular, octonionic
M¨obius transformations are

O (cid:51) o (cid:55)→ (αo + β)(γo + δ)−1 ∈ O,

αδ − βγ = 1,

where α, β, γ, δ lie in possibly diﬀerent complex subspaces of O [43]. A similar result
appears for quaternions (see [30, 46] and references therein).

To summarise, we can understand normed division algebras as Riemannian manifolds
with a Euclidean metric leading to the norm of the division algebra. The corresponding
conformal vector ﬁelds span ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebras conf(Rn) for n = 1, 2, 4 and
8. The ﬂows of these vector ﬁelds are then conformal transformations acting as M¨obius
transformations.

4 Fundamentals on Lie systems

In this section the notion of Lie systems and its characterisation in terms of t-dependent
vector ﬁelds and Lie algebras is detailed. All these concepts will be necessary to study
geometrically NDA Riccati equations.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A t-dependent vector ﬁeld on N is a map X : R×N (cid:51) (t, x) (cid:55)→ Xt(x) :=
X(t, x) ∈ T N, such that π ◦ X = p for π : T N → N and p : R × N (cid:51) (t, x) (cid:55)→ x ∈ N .

So, a t-dependent vector ﬁeld amounts to a family of vector ﬁelds {Xt}t∈R.

Deﬁnition 4.2. An integral curve of a t-dependent vector ﬁeld X on N is an integral
curve γ : R → R × N of the vector ﬁeld ∂/∂t + X(t, x) on R × N .

Every t-dependent vector ﬁeld admits a reparameterisation ¯t = ¯t(t) such that γ(¯t) =

(¯t, x(¯t)) and the system describing its integral curves becomes

d(p ◦ γ)

d¯t

(¯t) = (X ◦ γ)(¯t).

8

(4.1)

Conversely, every system in normal form can be brought into the above form for a
unique t-dependent vector ﬁeld. This motivates to use X to represent a t-dependent
vector ﬁeld and the system for its integral curves.

Deﬁnition 4.3. Given a t-dependent vector ﬁeld on N of the form

n(cid:88)

i=1

X(t, x) =

Xi(t, x)

∂
∂xi

,

its associated system is the system determining its integral curves, namely

dxi
dt

= Xi(t, x),

i = 1, . . . , n = dim N.

Example 4.4. A Riccati equation (1.1) is related to the t-dependent vector ﬁeld

X(t, x) = (b−(t) + b(0)(t)x + b+(t)x2)

∂
∂x

,

(4.2)

where we set b−(t) := a(t), b(0)(t) := b(t) and b+(t) := c(t). This notation will be
appropriate to relate NDA Riccati equations to graded Lie algebras.

Deﬁnition 4.5. The minimal Lie algebra of a t-dependent vector ﬁeld X is the smallest
real Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds, V X, containing {Xt}t∈R.
Example 4.6. The minimal Lie algebra of the t-dependent vector ﬁeld (4.2) for b−(t) =
b(0)(t) = b+(t) = a0 ∈ R is V X = (cid:104)a0(1 + x + x2)∂/∂x(cid:105).

Deﬁnition 4.7. A superposition rule depending on m particular solutions for a system
X on N is a function Φ : N m × N (cid:51) (x+, . . . , x(m), λ) (cid:55)→ x ∈ N, such that the general
solution of X can be brought into the form x(t) = Φ(x+(t), . . . , x(m)(t); λ), where x+(t),. . .,
x(m)(t) is any generic family of particular solutions and λ is a point of N to be related to
initial conditions.

Example 4.8. In the case of Riccati equations, expression (1.2) shows that they admit a
superposition rule Φ : R3 × R (cid:51) (x(1), x(2), x(3), k) (cid:55)→ x ∈ R of the form

x :=

x(1)(x(3) − x(2)) + kx(2)(x(3) − x(1))

x(3) − x(2) + k(x(3) − x(1))

.

Indeed, (1.2) implies that the general solution, x(t), to any Riccati equation takes the form

Deﬁnition 4.9. A nonautonomous system of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations
that admits a superposition rule is called a Lie system.

rule if and only if X =(cid:80)r

Theorem 4.10. (Lie–Scheﬀers Theorem [51]) A system X admits a superposition
α=1 bα(t)Xα for a certain family b1(t), . . . , br(t) of t-dependent
real functions and vector ﬁelds X1, . . . , Xr spanning an r-dimensional real Lie algebra V .

The Lie algebra V is called a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of X. The Lie–Scheﬀers
Theorem can be rewritten by saying that X admits a superposition rule if and only if V X
is ﬁnite-dimensional [13].

Example 4.11. We already know that Riccati equations are Lie systems, i.e. they have
a superposition rule. Let us verify that they satisfy the conditions detailed by the Lie–
Scheﬀers Theorem. The t-dependent vector ﬁeld associated with Riccati equations takes
the form

X(t, x) = b−(t)X− + b(0)(t)X (0) + b+(t)X +,

where X− := ∂/∂x, X (0) := x∂/∂x and X + := x2∂/∂x span a real Lie algebra VRic of
vector ﬁelds isomorphic to sl(2, R). Indeed,

[X−, X (0)] = X−,

[X−, X +] = 2X (0),

[X (0), X +] = X +.

Note that VRic = ⊕k∈ZV (k), for V (−1) := (cid:104)X−(cid:105), V (0) := (cid:104)X (0)(cid:105), V (1) := (cid:104)X +(cid:105) and V (k) = 0
for k ∈ Z\{−1, 0, 1}. Hence, [V (k1), V (k2)] ⊂ V (k1+k2) for any k1, k2 ∈ Z, i.e. VRic is a
Z-graded Lie algebra. The notation of each t-dependent function details the gradding of
the vector ﬁeld to which is related.

5 On the deﬁnition of octonionic Riccati equations
Inspired by the form of the Riccati equations over R, C and H, we propose a Riccati
equation over the octonions given by

= b−(t) + b0L(t)o + ob0R(t) + ob+(t)o,

o ∈ O,

(5.1)

do
dt

where b−(t), b0L(t), b0R(t), b+(t) are arbitrary O-valued t-dependent coeﬃcients. The mean-
ing of the notation employed for such functions will become fully clear posteriorly. Since
octonions are alternative, the term ob+(t)o is well deﬁned. Although this section is focused
on (5.1), the hereafter called octonionic Riccati equations, results can be easily extrapol-
ated to any other NDA Riccati equation, namely a Riccati equation like (5.1) where o is
assumed to belong to any normed division algebra.
The left-hand side of (5.1) at t = t0 can be understood as the limit limt→t0[o(t) −
o(t0)]/(t − t0) in O relative to the topology induced by the norm of O. Meanwhile,
the right-hand side of (5.1) is a mere element of O for each value of t. Geometrically,
the left-hand side of (5.1) gives rise to an element of ToO, i.e. the tangent vectors to
a curve γ : R (cid:51) t (cid:55)→ o(t) ∈ O passing through o at t and the right-hand side part

10

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)τ =0

can be understood for each value of t as an element of ToO by means of the mapping
λo : O (cid:51) ˜o (cid:55)→ λo(˜o) ∈ ToO of the form

[λo(˜o)]f :=

d
dτ

f (o + τ ˜o),

∀f ∈ C∞(O).

(5.2)

This mapping is a linear isomorphism over R [33]. Note also that (5.2) can immediately
be extended to any NDA.

Above viewpoints allow us to investigate the properties of octonionic Riccati equations.
One of their advantages is that they allow us to simplify calculations by using the algebraic
structure of octonions. For instance, the following lemma will enable us to easily obtain
Lie brackets of vector ﬁelds on O. It can also be easily extended to any other normed
division algebra.

Lemma 5.1. Given F 1), F 2)

6 NDA Riccati equations and Lie systems

Let us prove that a NDA Riccati equation over a normed division algebra A can be
considered as a particular type of conformal Riccati equation with a Vessiot–Guldberg
Lie algebra isomorphic to conf(A) (cid:39) so(dim A + 1, 1).
Conformal Riccati equations are Lie systems on a metric space (Rp+q, (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)) of signature
(p, q) that posses a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of conformal vector ﬁelds isomorphic to
so(p + 1, q + 1) (see [4] for details). More speciﬁcally, conformal Riccati equations take
the form

dξ
dt

= a(t) + λ(t)ξ + Ω(t)ξ + c(t)(cid:104)ξ, ξ(cid:105) − 2(cid:104)c(t), ξ(cid:105)ξ,

(6.1)
where a(t), c(t) ∈ Rp+q, λ(t) ∈ R and Ω(t) is a (p + q) × (p + q) real matrix such that
(cid:104)Ω(t)ξ1, ξ2(cid:105) = −(cid:104)ξ1, Ω(t)ξ2(cid:105), for every ξ1, ξ2 ∈ Rp+q and t ∈ R .

ξ ∈ Rp+q,

Theorem 6.1. Every NDA Riccati equation

= b−(t) + b0L(t)a + ab0R(t) + ab+(t)a,

a ∈ A,

(6.2)

da
dt

can be written in coordinates of a basis of A in the form (6.1), with λ(t) = b0L
0 (t),
the vectors a(t), c(t) being the vector coordinate expressions of the elements b−(t),−[b+(t)]∗
respectively, and Ω(t) being the matrix related to the R-linear operator Tt : A (cid:51) a (cid:55)→
b0L(t)a + ab0R(t) ∈ A.

0 (t) + b0R

12

Proof. Let us take any elements a, ˆa ∈ A. We have that

g(ab+(t)a, ˆa) = g(ab+(t), ˆaa∗) = 2g(a, ˆa)g(b+(t), a∗) − g(aa∗, ˆab+(t))

= 2g(a, ˆa)g(b+(t), a∗) − g(a, a)g(1, ˆab+(t))
= 2g(a, ˆa)g([b+(t)]∗, a) − g(a, a)g([b+(t)]∗, ˆa)
= g(2g([b+(t)]∗, a)a − [b+(t)]∗g(a, a), ˆa),

where we used relations (2.2),(2.3),(2.4) and (2.5). Since the above is true for arbitrary
ˆa ∈ A, we get from (2.1) that

ab+(t)a = 2g([b+(t)]∗, a)a − [b+(t)]∗g(a, a).
Let us prove that g(Tta, ˆa) = −g(a, Ttˆa) for every t ∈ R. Indeed,

g(Tta, ˆa) = g(b0L(t)a + ab0R(t), ˆa) = g(a, b0L(t)

∗

∗
ˆa + ˆab0R(t)

) = −g(a, Ttˆa).

Using the above, equation (6.2) can be rewritten as

= b−(t) + [b0L

0 (t) + b0R

0 (t)]a + Tta − [b+(t)]∗g(a, a) + 2g([b+(t)]∗, a)a.

da
dt

Choose a basis for A and deﬁne ξ to be the coordinate expression for a. Hence, Tta can
be written in coordinates as Ω(t)ξ, where Ω(t) is the matrix related to Tt in the chosen
basis. Fixing (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) in (6.1) to be g(·,·), which implies q = 0 and p = dim A because g(·,·)
is Euclidean, we obtain 0 = (cid:104)Ω(t)ξ1, ξ2(cid:105) + (cid:104)ξ1, Ω(t)ξ2(cid:105) and (6.1) becomes the coordinate
expression of (6.2).

Corollary 6.2. Every Riccati equation over a normed division algebra A admits a Vessiot–
Guldberg Lie algebra isomorphic to so(dim A + 1, 1).

7 Other deﬁnitions of octonionic Riccati equations

We now address the relevant question of the speciﬁc form of the octonionic Riccati equa-
tion (5.1). More speciﬁcally, we establish that the addition of other quadratic terms,
e.g. e(t)o2 or o2f (t) for generic t-dependent functions e(t) and f (t), is not desirable since
the t-dependent vector ﬁeld associated with (5.1) will no longer take values in a ﬁnite-
dimensional real Lie algebra, i.e. the new deﬁned octonionic Riccati equations will not be
Lie systems.

Throughout this section O is understood as an eight-dimensional manifold with a

Euclidean metric given by gO =(cid:80)7

(7.1)
and their successive Lie brackets span a Lie algebra V (0)◦ (cid:39) so(8) of Killing vector ﬁelds
with respect to gO.
Proof. First, let us prove that the norm on O, i.e. (cid:107)o(cid:107) =
vector ﬁelds X 0L

o∗o, is a ﬁrst-integral of the

for i = 1, . . . , 7. We have
i (cid:107)o(cid:107)2 = 2(cid:107)o(cid:107)X 0L
X 0L
Since (cid:107)o(cid:107)2 = (o0 − ¯o)(o0 + ¯o), we also obtain

i (cid:107)o(cid:107),

i = 1, . . . , 7.

¯o = eio and the scaling law (2.2), we get for i = 1, . . . , 7,

In view of (7.2), we get that f (o) = (cid:107)o(cid:107) is a ﬁrst-integral for the X 0L
i with i = 1, . . . , 7
at every o (cid:54)= 0. Since X 0L(0) = 0, then X 0Lf = 0 on the whole O2. The proof for the
vector ﬁelds X 0R
is generated by the vector
ﬁelds (7.1) and their successive Lie brackets, the norm becomes a ﬁrst-integral for all the
elements of V (0)◦

is analogous. Since every vector ﬁeld of V (0)◦

.

In view of Table 7, the vector ﬁelds (7.1) are linear in the chosen coordi-nates and
therefore their successive Lie brackets are also. The space of linear vector ﬁelds on O has
ﬁnite-dimension, then V (0)◦ must be ﬁnite-dimensional. In turn, we can deﬁne a linear Lie
group action Φ : G × O → O whose G is a connected Lie group such that TeG (cid:39) V (0)◦
.
Since the fundamental vector ﬁelds leave the norm invariant, we obtain that the norm
is invariant under the action by the linear isomorphisms Φg : O (cid:51) o (cid:55)→ Φ(g, o) ∈ O, for
g ∈ G. Let us denote by Φg∗ the tangent map to Φg. Therefore,

gO(Φg∗v1, Φg∗v2) =

[(cid:107)Φg∗(v1 + v2)(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)Φg∗v1(cid:107)2 − (cid:107)Φg∗v2(cid:107)2]

[(cid:107)(v1 + v2)(cid:107)2−(cid:107)v1(cid:107)2−(cid:107)v2(cid:107)2] = gO(v1, v2), ∀v1, v2 ∈ ToO,∀o ∈ O.

Hence, the elements of Φg are isometries of gO and they belong to O(8). Since G is
connected and the determinant of these mappings is a continuous function, it follows that
Φe = Id implies that Φg ∈ SO(8) for every g ∈ G and the fundamental vector ﬁelds of Φ
must be a Lie subalgebra of so(8).

2The function f (o) = (cid:107)o(cid:107) is not diﬀerentiable at o = 0, but it admits directional derivatives at this

point in terms of the tangent vectors X 0L

follows that the vector ﬁelds (cid:101)X0i := X 0L

where the ﬁrst case on the right-hand expressions follows from (2.8). Thus, we generate
ij (o) := λo[ei(ejo)], 0 < i < j ≤ 7. From Table 7, it

generate a Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds of dimension 28 within so(8). Since dim so(8) =
8 · 7/2 = 28, they must generate the whole Lie algebra. As SO(8) is a compact Lie
group, the exponential is surjective and G = SO(8). Since all vector ﬁelds of V (0)◦
are
fundamental vector ﬁelds of the action of SO(8) and in view of (7.3), they are Killing
vector ﬁelds with respect to gO.

If MX is traceless, we will say that X is traceless.

Proof. Consider the linear space V of linear vector ﬁelds on the coordinates o0, . . . , o7.
Each X ∈ V act on E := (cid:104)o0, . . . , o7(cid:105) as an R-linear operator with matrix MX in the
basis {o0, . . . , o7}. This gives rise to a Lie algebra isomorphism Ξ : V (cid:51) X (cid:55)→ −MX ∈
Mat(R8) (cf.
In view of the
coordinate expressions given in Table 7, the Ξ(X 0L
α ) are antisymmetric matrices
for α = 1, . . . , 7. As Ξ is a Lie algebra isomorphism and the X 0L
α and their successive
Lie brackets span V (0)◦ (cid:39) so(8) in view of Lemma 7.1, then the space Ξ(V (0)◦
) consists of
antisymmetric matrices spanning a subspace isomorphic to so(8). This Lie algebra is
a maximal Lie subalgebra of sl(8, R). The addition of any other element of sl(8, R) to
so(8) causes that the new subset can only be contained in the Lie algebra sl(8, R) (cf.
[18, 45, 54]). Similarly, since Ξ is a Lie algebra isomorphism, the addition of any new
traceless vector ﬁeld to V (0)◦
causes that the resulting space can only be contained in the
Lie algebra of traceless linear vector ﬁelds.
(cid:105)i=0,...,7 generate linear
traceless vector ﬁelds associated to not antisymmetric matrices. So, the vector ﬁelds
associated to (7.5) generate all linear traceless vector ﬁelds. Additionally, since X (0) is
not a traceless vector ﬁeld, the vector ﬁelds related to (7.5) generate all linear vector
ﬁelds. A short calculation shows that

The addition of a term o2f (t) with generic t-dependent O-valued function f (t) leads
to a similar result by using identical methods. It is straightforward to particularise the
above proposition for quaternionic Riccati equations.

Let us ﬁnally remark that octonionic Riccati equations do not cover all conformal
Riccati equations related to Riemannian metrics on R8. Octonionic Riccati equations
demand only 14 linear traceless vector ﬁelds to be described, namely X 0L
α with
α = 1, . . . , 7. This implies that its deﬁnition only contains 14 t-dependent coeﬃcients.

α and X 0R

Meanwhile, Ω(t) appearing in conformal Riccati equations has 28 independent t-dependent
entries. Thus, octonionic Riccati equations give rise to a subcase of conformal Riccati
equations. Nevertheless, Lemma 7.1 states that the traceless vector ﬁelds in the octonionic
Riccati equation generate a Lie algebra isomorphic to so(8), which has dimension 28.
Hence, octonionic Riccati equations and conformal Riccati equations over R8 share the
same Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra for generic coeﬃcients.

8 Linear systems and extensions for NDA Riccati

equations

It is well known that Riccati equations can be extended to the real projective line RP1 (cid:39)
S1. Moreover, particular solutions to Riccati equations can be obtained from particular
solutions to associated linear systems [32]. The same results cannot be so easily generalised
to quaternions and octonions because they are non-associative and non-commutative,
respectively. In this section, we will review the geometric approach to Riccati equations
and we will extend such an approach to general normed division algebras.
Consider the system on R2× := R2\{(0, 0)} of the form

Let us survey above mentioned known results on Riccati equations over the reals.

where (x1, x2) ∈ R2× and a11(t), a12(t), a21(t), a22(t) are arbitrary t-dependent real func-
tions.
We can retrieve the Riccati equation from the above system in the following way.
Deﬁne the surjective mapping π2 : (x1, x2) ∈ U2 ⊂ R2 (cid:55)→ x1/x2 ∈ R, with U2 :=
{(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x2 (cid:54)= 0}. If (x1(t), x2(t)) is a particular solution to (8.1) within U2, then
x(t) := π2(x1(t), x2(t)) satisﬁes

(a21(t)x1 + a22(t)x2)

= a12(t) + (a11(t) + a22(t))x + a21(t)x2.

So every particular solution to system (8.1) originates a particular solution to the above
Riccati equation. Since π2 is surjective, every solution to a Riccati equation can be
obtained from a particular solution of (8.1) with x2(t) (cid:54)= 0.

Let us describe the above results as a particular case of a more general geometric pro-
cedure describing the linearisation of quaternionic Riccati equations and their extension

to a projective quaternionic line. Next, the procedure will be generalized to octonions in
a nontrivial way.

The generalization of system (8.1) to the quaternions looks like

= a11(t)q1 + a12(t)q2,
= −a21(t)q1 − a22(t)q2,

(8.2)

for (q1, q2) ∈ H2× := H2\{(0, 0)} and the t-dependent functions a11(t), a12(t), a21(t), a22(t)
taking values in H. This system is associated with the t-dependent vector ﬁeld on H2× of
the form

XH(t, q1, q2) = λ(q1,q2)[a11(t)q1 + a12(t)q2,−a21(t)q1 − a22(t)q2].

As in the real case, if (q1(t), q2(t)) is a particular solution for the quaternionic system (8.2)
for q2(t) (cid:54)= 0, then q(t) := πH(q1(t), q2(t)), with πH : H2× → HP1 satisﬁes the quaternionic
Riccati equation (1.4). Indeed, using the coordinate ψ2 : [q1 : q2] ∈ D2 (cid:55)→ w2 := q1q−1
2 ∈
R4 we can write q(t) = q1(t)q−1

2 (t) and

(8.3)

We obtain that in the coordinates {q1, q2} for D2, understood as a subset of R8, and
w2 for HP1, understood as an element of R4, the t-dependent vector ﬁeld πH∗XH looks
like

πH∗(XH(t, q1, q2)) = λw2[a12(t) + a11(t)w2 + w2a22(t) + w2a21(t)w2].

And using coordinates for w1 = q−1 an analogue result is obtained:
= −w1a12(t)w1 − w1a11(t) − a22(t)w1 − a21(t).

dw1

(8.4)

Hence, πH∗XH is well deﬁned on the whole HP1. In one set of coordinates, it becomes
the quaternionic Riccati equations and, in the other, a related one. Thus, quaternionic
Riccati equations can be extended to HP1 (cid:39) S4 [11]. A similar result follows for R and
C by applying the same approach.

The ‘linearisation’ of octonionic Riccati equations is much more subtle because of
the lack of associativity. Due to this, the system (8.1) is generalised to the system on

18

where (o1, o2) ∈ O2× and aij(t), with i, j = 1, 2, are t-dependent O-valued functions.
The morphism πO : O2× → OP1 is diﬀerentiable and for particular solutions (o1(t), o2(t))
with o2(t)o1(t) (cid:54)= 0 of the previous system we obtain that using the coordinate chart ψ2
the curve πO(o1(t), o2(t)) reads

+ o2{o−1

(8.6)

= a12(t) + a11(t)o + oa22(t) + oa21(t)o,

where we used Lemma 2.5 and (2.7). For quaternions, system (8.5) reduces to a linear
system due to associativity. For octonions, the lack of associativity causes the terms on
a11(t) and a22(t) to be no longer linear. Therefore, we will restrict the equation to the
case of a11(t) and a22(t) being real t-dependent functions, when (8.6) can be proved to be
linear. In fact,

o2 = a11(t)[(o1o−1

o2{o−1

1 [(o1o−1

2 )a22(t)]}o2 = a22(t)[o2{o−1

2 )o2] = a11(t)o1
1 (o1o−1

2 )}o2] = a22(t)o2.

We can now relate the t-dependent vector ﬁeld XO on O2× associated with (8.5) to a t-
dependent vector ﬁeld on the octonionic projective line. We obtain that in the coordinates
{o1, o2} for D2, thought of as a subset of R8 × R8, and w2 for OP1 the t-dependent vector
ﬁeld πO∗XO looks like

πO∗(XO(t, o1, o2)) = λw2[a12(t) + a11(t)w2 + w2a22(t) + w2a21(t)w2].

And using coordinates for w1 an analogue result is obtained. Hence, we obtain that π∗XO
is well deﬁned on the whole OP1. In one set of coordinates, it becomes the t-dependent
vector ﬁeld associated with octonionic Riccati equations and a related one in the other.
Therefore, the previous result allows us to extend octonionic Riccati equations with real
t-dependent functions a11(t) and a22(t) to OP1 (cid:39) S8.

The whole octonionic Riccati equations can be extended to S8. It is enough to observe
that the vector ﬁelds needed to describe (8.6) with real a11(t) and a22(t) generate under
commutations all elements of conf(R8) (cid:39) so(9, 1). Let us prove this fact.

ij (o) :=
therefore obtain a family of 29 R-linearly independent vector ﬁelds (cid:101)Xij, with 0 ≤ i < j ≤ 7

and i = j = 0, which take the form given in Table 7. All these vector ﬁelds are linear.
Since the coeﬃcients of the vector ﬁelds V + are quadratic on the variables o0, . . . , o7 and
the coeﬃcients of the vector ﬁelds V − are non-zero constants, we obtain that all the
previous vector ﬁelds are linearly independent and span the whole Vessiot–Guldberg Lie
algebra V

As the vector ﬁelds related to (8.6) are diﬀerentiable, can be extended to OP1, and
, then all such vector ﬁelds do also. Since πO∗ is
generate along with their Lie brackets V
a Lie algebra morphism from vector ﬁelds on O2× onto OP1 and the vector ﬁelds of V − and
V + are projections of well-deﬁned linear vector ﬁelds on O2×, then the t-dependent vector
ﬁeld associated with (8.6) can be written as the projection of a t-dependent linear vector
ﬁeld on O2× giving rise to a linear system of diﬀerential equations linearising octonionic
Riccati equations. So, we have proved the following result.
Theorem 8.2. Every octonionic Riccati equation can be extended to OP1 and lifted to a
linear system on O2×.

9 Symplectic structures and NDA Riccati equations

A relevant question on the study of Lie systems is the existence of a symplectic form
turning the vector ﬁelds of the Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra into Hamiltonian vector
ﬁelds. We hereafter analyse the existence of such a symplectic structure for a general
Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra on a manifold and, in particular, in the case of octonionic
Riccati equations.

Proposition 9.1. No NDA Riccati equation admits a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of
Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds for generic t-dependent coeﬃcients.

Proof. Let us prove our claim by reduction to absurd. Assuming the NDA Riccati equa-
tion to be a Hamiltonian system for generic t-dependent coeﬃcients implies that there

20

exists a symplectic form ω on A turning the Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra V A of the
ω = LX (0)ω = 0
NDA Riccati equation into Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. In particular, LX−
for i = 0, . . . , 7. Since the vector ﬁelds {X−
i }i=0,...,7 commute between themselves and
they are by assumption Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, we obtain LX−
[ω(X−
i , X−
j )] = 0 for
i , X−
i, j, k = 0, . . . , 7. Since the X−
j )
are constants. As LX (0)ω = 0 and [X (0), X−

i , with i = 0, . . . , 7, span T A, then the functions ω(X−

j with j = 0, . . . , 7, then

k

0 = LX (0)(ω(X−

i , X−

j )) = −2ω(X−

i, j = 0, . . . , 7.

j ] = −X−
i , X−
j ),

Then, ω = 0, which is against our initial assumption. Hence, V A is not a Lie algebra of
Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds relative to any symplectic structure.

As general NDA Riccati equations do not posses Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebras of
Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, there are many geometric methods, e.g. the co-algebra methods
for superposition rules [7], which cannot be used. Nevertheless, particular NDA Riccati
equations may admit a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. The
case of complex Riccati equations with t-dependent real coeﬃcients was considered in
[26]. Let us turn now to the octonionic Riccati equation

turning the vector ﬁelds (9.2) into (locally) Hamiltonian with respect to it, i.e. LXωO = 0
for every X ∈ V RO. We introduce the new local coordinates on O given by {o0, ρ :=
i , α, β, γ, ψ, θ, φ}, where the latter six variables form a local coordinate system

10 Applications in quaternionic quantum mechanics

Some attempts to generalize quantum mechanics to the realm of the quaternions have
been performed [25, 27, 35]. Much has been done to establish whether this is an appro-
priate approach [1, 2]. We here show that Riccati equations over H can be employed in
quaternionic quantum mechanics [3].

The quaternionic Schr¨odinger equation [21] is a generalization of the typical Schr¨odinger

equation of the form

metric, and 1, i, j, k being the elements e0, e1, e2, e3 generating H. As usual, , m are the
Planck constant and the mass of the particle, respectively. It worth noting that (10.1) is
H-linear relative to multiplication on the right.
namely Φ(x, t) = Ψ(x) exp [−iEt/] , E ∈ R. Hence,

Let us study the solutions of (10.1) on R1+1 taking the form of stationary states,

11 Conclusions and Outlook

We have proposed a new type of Riccati equations over the octonions and normed di-
vision algebras. We have proved that this is the only possible generalisation being a
Lie system. We have showed that NDA Riccati equations can be written as particular
types of conformal Riccati equations. We provided a new procedure to link NDA Riccati
equations to a type of linear systems over normed division algebras and we demonstrated
that NDA Riccati equations can be extended to projective lines. As a byproduct, other
results for diﬀerent types of Riccati equations in the literature have been retrieved. We
have also studied several types of NDA equations admitting compatible symplectic struc-
tures. Finally, quaternionic Riccati equations have been applied in quaternionic quantum
mechanics.

23

This work can be considered as a ﬁrst study on conformal Lie systems, namely Lie
systems with a Vessiot–Guldberg Lie algebra of conformal vector ﬁelds. In the future we
expect to study the general properties of these Lie systems by analysing, for instance,
the use of conformal structures to obtain their superposition rules, constants of motions
and Lie symmetries. We also plan to investigate Riccati equations over composition and
Cliﬀord algebras as well as to develop a theory of manifolds modeled on such structures.
Finally, we aim to look for new potential applications of our methods.
