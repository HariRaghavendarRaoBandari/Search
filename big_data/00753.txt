ON EQUIVARIANT MAPS RELATED TO THE SPACE OF PAIRS OF EXCEPTIONAL

JORDAN ALGEBRAS

RYO KATO AND AKIHIKO YUKIE

ABSTRACT. Let J be the exceptional Jordan algebra and V = J ⊕ J . We construct an equivariant
map from V to Homk(J ⊗ J , J ) deﬁned by homogeneous polynomials of degree 8 such that if x ∈ V
is a generic point, then the image of x is the structure constant of the isotope of J corresponding to
x. We also give an alternative way to deﬁne the isotope corresponding to a generic point of J by an
equivariant map from J to the space of trilinear forms.

1. INTRODUCTION

Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic not equal to 2, 3, ksep the separable closure of k and k the algebraic

closure of k. Let eO be the split octonion over k. It is the normed algebra over k obtained by the
Cayley–Dickson process (see [2, pp.101–110]). If A is the algebra of 2 × 2 matrices, eO is A(+) with
the notation of [2]. An octonion is, by deﬁnition, a normed algebra which is a k-form of eO. Let O

be an octonion. We use the notation kxk for the norm of x ∈ O. If a ∈ k, kaxk = a2kxk. Also if
x, y ∈ O, then kxyk = kxkkyk. For x, y ∈ O, let

Q(x, y) = 1

2 (kx + yk − kxk − kyk).

This is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form such that Q(x, x) = kxk. Let W ⊂ O be the
orthogonal complement of k · 1 with respect to Q. If x = x1 + x2 where x1 ∈ k · 1, x2 ∈ W, then we
deﬁne x = x1 − x2 and call it the conjugate of x. Note that kxk = xx. For x ∈ O, we deﬁne the trace
tr(x) by tr(x) = x + x. It is easy to verify that

tr(xy) = tr(yx), 2Q(x, y) = tr(xy).

Let GL(n) be the group of n × n invertible matrices over k. If V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space, then we denote the group of invertibel linear maps from V to V by GL(V). Let J be the
exceptional Jordan algebra over k. Elements of J are of the form:

X = 


s1
x3
x2

x3
s2
x1

x2
x1
s3


 , si ∈ k, xi ∈ O (i = 1, 2, 3),

The multiplication of J is deﬁned as follows:

X ◦ Y =

1
2

(XY + YX),

where the multiplication used on the right-hand side is the multiplication of matrices.

The algebraic groups E6 and GE6 are given by

E6 = {L ∈ GL(J )|∀X ∈ J , det(LX) = det(X)},

GE6 = {L ∈ GL(J )|∀X ∈ J , det(LX) = c(L) det(X) for some c(L) ∈ GL(1)}

respectively. Then c : GE6 → GL(1) is a character and there exists an exact sequence

It is known that E6 is a smooth connected quasi-simple simply-connected algebraic group of
type E6 (see [5, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]). The terminology “quasi-simple” means that its inner auto-
morphism group is simple (see [4, p.136]). The smoothness of the group follows from the fact that
the dimension of E6 as a variety and the dimension of the Lie algebra of E6 coincide (see the proof
of [5, p.181, Theorem 7.3.2]).

Let H1 = E6, G1 = GE6, H = H1 × GL(2) and G = G1 × GL(2). Let V = J ⊗ Aff2. We regard
elements of V as the set of x = x1v1 + x2v2 where x1, x2 ∈ J and two variables v1, v2. The action
of g = (g1, g2) ∈ G where g2 = ( a b

c d(cid:1) on V is given by

(1.2)

g(x1v1 + x2v2) = g1(x1)(av1 + cv2) + g1(x2)(bv1 + dv2).

For x = x1v1 + x2v2 ∈ V, we put Fx(v) = Fx(v1, v2) = det(x). Then Fx(v) is a binary cubic form.
Let ∆(x) be the discriminant of Fx(v) as a polynomial of v. Let

(1.3)

w = w1v1 + w2v2 = 


1
0
0 −1


 v1 +


0
0
0

0
0
0

0
0
0
1
0 −1


 v2 ∈ J ⊗ Aff2.

Then it is easy to see that Fw(v) = v1v2(v1 − v2) and ∆(w) = 1. The pair (G, V) is an irreducible
regular prehomogenerous vector space (see [3, Proposition 3.2] and [6]) and the polynimial ∆(x) is
what we call a relative invariant polynomial. We deﬁne Vss = {x ∈ V | ∆(x) 6= 0}. Points in Vss are
called semi-stable points. As we pointed out as above, w ∈ Vss
k . The polynomial ∆(x) is of degree 12.
If we put χ(g) = c(g1)4 det(g2)6 for g = (g1, g2) ∈ G, then ∆(gx) = χ(g)∆(x).

A Jordan algebra M is called an isotope of J if M ⊗ ksep ∼= J ⊗ ksep and the “determinant” of
M is a constant multiple of that of J . For details, the reader should see [5, pp.154–158]. If M1, M2
are isotopes of J and n1 ⊂ M1, n2 ⊂ M2 are cubic ´etale subalgebras, then the pairs (M1, n1),
(M2, n2) are deﬁned to be equivalent if there exists a k-isomorphism M1 → M2 which induces an
isomorphism from n1 to n2. Let JIC(k) be the set of equivalence classes of pairs (M, n) as above.

In [3], to each point in Vss

k , a pair (M, n) ∈ JIC(k) was associated. It is proved in [3, Theorem
5.8] that there is a bijective correspondence between the set Gk\Vss
k of rational orbits and JIC(k).
Moreover, an equivariant map m : V → J was deﬁned and the Jordan algebra corresponding to
x ∈ Vss

k was explicitly described using the point m(x) (see [3, Section 5]).

Let t ⊂ J be the subalgebra of diagonal matrices, which is isomorphic to k3. Let Aut(J ) be
the algebraic group of automorphisms of the Jordan algebra J . We deﬁne Aut(J , t) to be the
subgroup of Aut(J ) consisting of automorphisms L such that L(t) = t. It is proved in ( [3, Theorem
3.1, Lemma 4.2]) that Gw ∼= GL(1) × Aut(J , t). The ﬁrst Galois cohomology set H1(k, GL(1) ×
Aut(J , t)) can be identiﬁed with H1(k, Aut(J , t)) and there is a natural map H1(k, Aut(J , t)) →
H1(k, Aut(J )). One can show by standard argument that elements of H1(k, Aut(J )) correspond
bijectively with k-forms of J .

Suppose that x = gxw ∈ Vss

k where gx ∈ Gksep. Then hx : Gal(ksep/k) ∋ σ 7→ g−1

x ∈ Gw ksep
is a 1-cocycle, which deﬁnes an element, say cx of H1(k, Gw). This element cx does not depend on
the choice of gx. Since there is a natural map H1(k, Gw) ∼= H1(k, Aut(J , t)) → H1(k, Aut(J )) (∼=
means bijection), cx determines a k-form of J . If x corresponds to a pair (M, n), then M is the
k-form of J which is determined by cx. The underlying vector space of M is J . To deﬁne a Jordan
algebra sutructure on J , it is enough to deﬁne the product strucuture, which is given by an element
of Homk(J ⊗ J , J ) (we call this element the “structure constant”).

x gσ

If we choose bases of V, J as k-vector spaces, the map m : V → J is given by homogeneous
polynomials of degree 4 on V. The structure constant which is associated to elements of J is,
with the denominator multiplied, given by homogeneous polynomials of degree 11 on J . So the
structure constant of M is given by homogeneous polynomials of degree 44 on V.
The ﬁrst purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem (see Section 2).

Theorem 1.4. There is an equivariant map S : V ∋ x 7→ Sx ∈ Homk(J ⊗ J , J ) deﬁned by homogeneous
k corresponds to the pair (M, n) ∈ JIC(k), then ∆(x)−1Sx
polynomials of degree 8 on V such that if x ∈ Vss
is the structure constant of the Jordan algebra M.

Let a ∈ J and det(a) 6= 0. In [5, p. 155], for X, Y ∈ J , the product structure X ◦a Y deﬁning the
isotope Ja and the corresponding symmeric bilinear form Qa(X, Y) are given (see (3.5)). Then J 3 ∋
(X, Y, Z) 7→ Ta(X, Y, Z) = Qa(X ◦a Y, Z) is a trilinear form on J . To construct Ta ﬁrst equivariantly
to provide an alternative way to deﬁne the product structure on Ja is another purpose of this paper.

We prove the following theorem in Section 3.

Theorem 1.5. There is an equivariant map T : J ∋ a 7→ Ta ∈ Homk(J ⊗ J ⊗ J , k) deﬁned by
homogeneous olnynomials of degree 6 such that if for X, Y ∈ J , X ◦a Y ∈ J is the element such Qa(X ◦a
Y, Z) = det(a)−1Ta(X, Y, Z) for all Z ∈ J , then this product structure coincides with that of the isotope
Ja.

We prove Theorem 1.4 in this section. We ﬁrst deﬁne basic notions and then deﬁne the desired

2. EQUIVARIANT MAP I

equivariant map.

We denote the 3 × 3 diagonal matrix with diagonal entries α1, α2, α3 ∈ k× by diag(α1, α2, α3).

J n⊗ is the tensor product of n copies of J . We deﬁne a symmetric trilinear form D on J by

6D(X, Y, Z) = det(X + Y + Z) − det(X + Y) − det(Y + Z) − det(Z + X)

+ det(X) + det(Y) + det(Z)

for X, Y, Z ∈ J . Let Tr(X) be the sum of diagonal entries of X ∈ J . For X, Y ∈ J , we deﬁne a
symmetric bilinear form h , i on J by

hX, Yi = Tr(X ◦ Y).

One can verify by direct computation that the symmetric bilinear form h , i satisﬁes the following
equation:

(2.1)

hX ◦ Y, Zi = hX, Y ◦ Zi,

∀X, Y, Z ∈ J .

For X, Y ∈ J , the cross product X × Y is, by deﬁnition, the element satisfying the following

equation:

hX × Y, Zi = 3D(X, Y, Z),

∀Z ∈ J .

Let e = I3. Then the following equations are satisﬁed (see [5, p.122, Lemma 5.2.1]).

(2.2)

∀X ∈ J , X ◦ (X × X) = det(X)e,

e × e = e.

For any g ∈ GL(J ), we deﬁne eg ∈ GL(J ) by

hg(X),eg(Y)i = hX, Yi,

∀X, Y ∈ J .

The following lemma is proved in [5, p.180, Proposition 7.3.1].

Lemma 2.3. The map g 7→ eg is an automorphism of H1 with order 2 and for all X, Y ∈ J ,

g(X × Y) = eg(X) × eg(Y), eg(X × Y) = g(X) × g(Y).

Corollay 2.4. If g ∈ G1 and X, Y, Z, W ∈ J , then

g((X × Y) × (Z × W)) = c(g)−1 (g(X) × g(Y)) × (g(Z) × g(W)) .

Proof. There exists t ∈ k such that t3 = c(g1). Then t−1g ∈ H1 k. So
g ((X × Y) × (Z × W)) = t(t−1g) ((X × Y) × (Z × W))

= t(cid:16)t−1g(X) × t−1g(Y)(cid:17) ×(cid:16)t−1g(Z) × t−1g(W)(cid:17)
= c(g)−1 (g(X) × g(Y)) × (g(Z) × g(W)) .

Then Ψi induces a k-linear map J 8⊗ → Homk(J ⊗ J , J ) for i = 1, 2. We deﬁne
(2.10)

Φi,(a,b)(X, Y) = Ψi(t4(a, b))(X, Y)

Lemma 2.11. Φi,gx(g1X, g1Y) = c(g1)3 det(g2)4g1(Φi,x(X, Y)) for i = 1, 2 and all g = (g1, g2) ∈ G,
X, Y ∈ J .

Proof. If x = (x1, x2), then t4(x1, x2) depends only on x1 ∧ x2. If g2 ∈ GL(2) and y = (y1, y2) = gx,
then y1 ∧ y2 = (det(g2))x1 ∧ x2. Since x1 ⊗ x2 − x2 ⊗ x1 can be identiﬁed with x1 ∧ x2 and it
appears in the deﬁnition of t4(x1, x2) four times, t4(y1, y2) = (det g2)4t4(x1, x2). So we may assume
that g2 = 1 and only consider the action of G1.

Suppose that v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v8 is a term which appears in the expansion of t4(x1, x2). If g1 ∈ G1 and
x is replaced by g1x = (g1x1, g1x2), then terms which appear in the expansion of t4(g1x1, g1x2) are
in the form g1v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ g1v8. By Corollary 2.4,

D(g1v2, g1v5, g1v7)D(g1v4, g1v6, g1v8)(g1v1 × g1v3) × (g1X × g1Y),

= c(g1)3D(v2, v5, v7)D(v4, v6, v8)g1((v1 × v3) × (X × Y)).

Also

D(g1v2, g1v5, g1v7)D(g1v4, g1v6, g1v8)(D(g1v1, g1v3, g1X)g1Y + D(g1v1, g1v3, g1Y)g1X)

= c(g1)3D(v2, v5, v7)D(v4, v6, v8)g1(D(v1, v3, X)Y + D(v1, v3, Y)X).

Therefore, Φi,g1x(g1X, g1Y) = c(g1)3g1(Φi,x(X, Y)) for i = 1, 2.

We ﬁrst evaluate Φ1,w (see (1.3)).

Proof. Suppose that (a, b) = w = (w1, w2) in the following. If we expand t4(a, b), then the coefﬁ-
cient of [[i1, i2|i3, i4|i5, i6|i7, i8]](a,b) is 1 (resp. −1) if the number of j = 1, . . . , 4 such that (i2j−1, i2j) =
(2, 1) is even (resp. odd). We list the sign in t4(a, b), D(v2, v5, v7)D(v4, v6, v8) and v1 × v3 in the

9Φ1,w(X, Y) = −(2a × a + a × b + a × b + 2b × b) × (X × Y).

If we put c = a + b = diag(1, 0, −1), then

9Φ1,w(X, Y) = −(a × a + b × b + c × c) × (X × Y).

By (2.7) and (2.8)

a × a = diag(0, 0, −1), b × b = diag(−1, 0, 0), c × c = diag(0, −1, 0).

Therefore, 9Φ1,w(X, Y) = e × (X × Y). Since e is the unit element of J , replacing X, Y in (2.8) by
e, X × Y, we obtain

9Φ1,w(X, Y) = X × Y −

Proposition 2.14. For all X, Y ∈ J , 3Φ2,w(X, Y) = Tr(Y)X + Tr(X)Y.

(2.15)

3Φ2,w(X, Y) = −3(D(a, a, X) + D(b, b, X) + D(c, c, X))Y

Φ2,(a,b)(X, Y).

The following proposition follows from Lemma 2.11 and (2.13), (2.15).

Proposition 2.17.

(1) If x ∈ Vk, g = (g1, g2) ∈ Gk and X, Y ∈ J , then

Sgx(g1X, g1Y) = c(g1)3 det(g2)4g1(Sx(X, Y)).

(2) Sw(X, Y) = X ◦ Y.

Let ∆(x) be the relaaive invariant polynomial of degree 12 and ∆(w) = 1 which we deﬁned in

Introduction. For x ∈ Vss

k , we deﬁne a k-algebra structure ◦x on J by

(2.18)

X ◦x Y

def= ∆(x)−1Sx(X, Y).

We denote this k-algebra on the underlying vector space J by Mx. Proposition 2.17 (2) implies
that Mw is isomorphic to J (the original Jordan algebra structure).

For g = (g1, g2) ∈ G, we deﬁne an element of G1 by

(2.19)

µg = c(g1) det(g2)2g1 ∈ G1.

Note that the map g → µg is a homomorphism.

Theorem 2.20. If x, y ∈ Vss

Proof. Let X, Y ∈ Jksep = Mx ksep. Then

µg(X) ◦y µg(Y) = ∆(gx)−1Sgx(c(g1) det(g2)2g1(X), c(g1) det(g2)2g1(Y))

= ∆(gx)−1c(g1)2 det(g2)4Sgx(g1(X), g1(Y))
= ∆(gx)−1c(g1)2 det(g2)4c(g1)3 det(g2)4g1(Sx(X, Y)) by Proposition 2.17
= ∆(gx)−1∆(x)c(g1)4 det(g2)6c(g1) det(g2)2g1(∆(x)−1Sx(X, Y))
= c(g1) det(g2)2g1(X ◦x Y) = µg(X ◦x Y).

Therefore, µg is a homomorphism. Since µg is obviously bijecive, it is an isomorphism.

(cid:3)

The above theorem implies that if gx = (g1, g2) ∈ Gksep and x = gxw ∈ Vss

for a, X, Y, Z ∈ J . Then the map

is k-linear.

Lemma 3.2. If a ∈ J , g ∈ G1 and X, Y, Z ∈ J , then

Tga(gX, gY, gZ) = c(g)3g(Ta(X, Y, Z)).

Proof. There exists t ∈ k such that t3 = c(g). We put g1 = t−1g. Then g = tg1 and g1 ∈ H1 k. So,

D(ga × gX, ga × gY, ga × gZ) = t6D(g1a × g1X, g1a × g1Y, g1a × g1Z)
= t6D(eg1(a × X),eg1(a × Y),eg1(a × Z))

= t6D(a × X, a × Y, a × Z)
= c(g)2D(a × X, a × Y, a × Z).

Since D(ga, ga, gX) = c(g)D(a, a, X), etc., the lemma follows.

(cid:3)

The following proposition plays a crucial role in proving Theorem 1.5.

Proposition 3.3. Te(X, Y, Z) = Tr((X ◦ Y) ◦ Z) (= Tr(X ◦ (Y ◦ Z))) for all X, Y, Z ∈ J .

Proof. Since D(e, e, e) = 1,

Te(X, Y, Z) = 27D(e, e, X)D(e, e, Y)D(e, e, Z) − 24D(e × X, e × Y, e × Z).

Replacing X, Y in (2.6) by X ◦ Y, Z respetively and taking the sum of diagonal entries, we can

express 4Tr((X ◦ Y) ◦ Z) in the following manner:

2(2s1t1 + tr(x3y3 + x2y2))u1
+ tr((s1y3 + x3t2 + x2 y1 + t1x3 + y3s2 + y2 x1)z3 + (s1y2 + x3y1 + x2t3 + t1x2 + y3x1 + y2s3)z2)

This coincides with 4 times (3.4).

(cid:3)

The construction of the isotope deﬁned for a ∈ J (det(a) 6= 0) is given in [5, p.155]. Let

Qa(X, Y) = −6 det(a)D(X, Y, a) + 9D(X, a, a)D(Y, a, a),

(3.5)

Φa(X, Y) = 4 det(a)3(X × a) × (Y × a) +

1
2

(det(a)2Qa(X, Y) − Qa(X, a)Qa(Y, a))a.

Then the product structure and the associated bilinear form of the isotope corresponding to a ∈ J
is given by

J 2 ∋ (X, Y) 7→ X ◦a Y

J 2 ∋ (X, Y) 7→ hX, Yia

def= det(a)−4Φa(X, Y) ∈ J ,
def= det(a)−2Qa(X, Y) ∈ k.

(see [5, p.147, Proposition 5.6.2], [5, p.153, Proposition 5.8.2], [5, p.155, Proposition 5.9.2]).

Here we provide an alternative way to deﬁne the product structure on Ja.

Deﬁnition 3.6. Suppose that a ∈ J , det(a) 6= 0. For X, Y ∈ J , we deﬁne X ◦a Y ∈ J to be the
element such that Qa(X ◦a Y, Z) = det(a)−1Ta(X, Y, Z) for all Z ∈ J .

Since Qa is a non-degenerate bilinear form, the deﬁnition of X ◦a Y is well-deﬁned.

Theorem 3.7. If a ∈ J , det(a) 6= 0, ga ∈ GE6 ksep, a = gae ∈ J , then J ⊗ ksep ∋ X 7→ gX ∈ Ja ⊗ ksep
induces an isomorphism of k-algebras J ⊗ ksep ∼= Ja ⊗ ksep.
Proof. Suppose that X, Y, Z ∈ J ⊗ ksep. Since det(a) = c(g) det(e) = c(g),

Qa(g(X ◦ Y), gZ) = c(g)2Qe(X ◦ Y, Z) = c(g)2Te(X, Y, Z) = c(g)−1Ta(gX, gY, gZ)

= det(a)−1Ta(gX, gY, gZ) = Qa(gX ◦a gY, gZ).

Since this holds for all Z ∈ J ⊗ ksep, g(X ◦ Y) = gX ◦a gY. Therefore, g induces an isomorphism of
k-algebras J ⊗ ksep ∼= Ja ⊗ ksep.
(cid:3)

In the situation of Theorem 3.7, Ja can be identiﬁed with the k-form g−1(Ja) ⊂ Jksep. Therefore,

this Ja concides with the isotope Ja constructed in [5].

Let m : V → J be the equivariant map in [3, Section 5]. Since m is deﬁned by homogeneous
polynomials of degree 4, Qm(x), Tm(x) are deﬁned by homogeneous polynomials of degrees 16, 24
respectively. Can we construct lower degree equivariant maps from V to the space of bilinear
forms and trilinear forms on J to give an alternative way to deﬁne the product sutrucure on Mx
(see (2.18))? It does not seem so. For example, if there were such a quadratic form Qx depending on
x, the degree must be 16 − 12 = 4. However, there seems to be only one equivariant map of degree
