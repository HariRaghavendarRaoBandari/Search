We studied the superconducting (SC) state depletion process in an electron doped cuprate
Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4−δ by pumping with near-infrared (NIR) and narrow-band THz pulses. When
pumping with THz pulses tuned just above the SC gap, we ﬁnd the absorbed energy density required
to deplete superconductivity, Adep, matches the thermodynamic condensation energy. Contrary, by
NIR pumping Adep is an order of magnitude higher, despite the fact that the SC gap is much smaller
than the energy of relevant bosonic excitations. The result implies that only a small subset of bosons
contribute to pairing.

The quest for a pairing boson in cuprate high-
temperature superconductors has been one of the key
topics of solid state physics ever since the discovery of
superconductivity in the cuprates. Recently, numerous
femtosecond (fs) real-time studies of carrier dynamics
in high-Tc superconductors have been performed aim-
ing to ﬁnd the coupling strengths between the electrons
and other degrees of freedom (high and low frequency
phonons, spin ﬂuctuations, electronic continuum)[1–8].
In this approach, fs optical pulses are used to excite
the electronic system, while the resulting dynamics are
probed by measuring the changes in optical constants
[2–6] or the electronic distribution near the Fermi energy
[1, 7, 8]. To connect the measured relaxation timescales
to the electron-boson coupling strengths, the multi-
temperature models are commonly used [9, 10]. These
are based on the premise that the electron-electron (e-
e) thermalization is much faster than the electron-boson
relaxation. While these models are commonly used to ex-
tract e.g. the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling strengths,
numerous inconsistencies have been noted (even for the
case of simple metals) [11–14]. An alternative time-
domain approach, based on the dynamics in the super-
conducting state, has been put forward [15, 16]. Un-
der the assumption that the absorbed optical energy is
distributed between quasiparticles and high frequency
(ω > 2∆) bosons on the sub-picosecond timescale,
and taking into account the nonlinearity of relaxation
processes (pairwise recombination of quasiparticles), the
electron-boson coupling strength is determined by study-
ing the excitation density dependence of the Cooper
pair-breaking process [15, 16]. While this approach has
been successfully applied to conventional superconduc-
tors [16, 17], the results on cuprates show that the energy

density required to suppress superconductivity exceeds
the thermodynamic condensation energy, Ec, by an or-
der of magnitude [2, 18–20]. Therefore, the assumption
that the absorbed energy is distributed between QPs and
the coupled high frequency bosons fails. Considering the
possible energy relaxation pathways, this discrepancy in
the hole-doped high-Tc cuprates has been attributed to
the fact that the superconducting gap, 2∆, lies well in
the range of optical phonons [19].
It has been argued
that ≈ 90 % of the absorbed energy is directly released
to ω < 2∆ modes via rapid e-ph scattering (mainly
to sub-gap zone center optical phonons and zone-edge
acoustic phonons) and only ≈ 10 % is available for con-
densate quenching [19]. Indeed, it has been shown that
in YBCO the rapid e-ph transfer gives rise to a rapid
heating of speciﬁc phonons on the timescale of ≈ 100 fs
[21]. Studying cuprate superconductors with 2∆ far be-
low the energy of optical phonons can put this argument
to the test.

In this Letter we present a systematic study of
light induced quenching of superconductivity in an e-
doped cuprate [22] superconductor Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4−δ
(PCCO) at optimal doping. We used near-infrared (λ =
800 nm) as well as narrow-band THz (λ = 144 µm) exci-
tation, while probing the superconducting gap dynamics

26], well below the acoustic phonon cut-oﬀ frequency of
≈ 20 meV [27], as well as the energy of the collective
electronic mode of ≈ 11 ± 2 meV [28, 29]. Like in NbN
[16], we expected the absorbed energy density required
to deplete superconductivity, Adep, to be in the low tem-
perature limit the same in the two conﬁgurations, with
Adep ≈ Ec. We demonstrate that this is not the case,
suggesting that the Eliashberg electron-boson coupling

function in cuprates depends strongly on the electron en-
ergy, unlike to what is commonly assumed [10, 30].

Optimally doped c-axis oriented PCCO thin ﬁlms
with a thickness d = 60 nm were epitaxially grown on
LaSrGaO4 (001) (LSGO) substrates using pulsed laser
deposition [31]. Inductive measurements of the samples
yield a Tc ≈ 21 K. The broadband linear and time-
resolved THz spectroscopy were performed on the set-
up built around a 250 kHz ampliﬁed Ti:sapphire laser
system and utilizing large area interdigitated photocon-
ductive emitter for the generation of THz pulses [32].
Narrow band THz pumping experiments were performed
at the free electron laser (FEL) facility at the Helmholtz-
Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. Here, intense narrowband
(spectral width ≈ 30 GHz, pulse length τFEL ≈ 18 ps)
THz pulses at νFEL = 2.08 THz, slightly above the low-
temperature gap frequency 2∆/h ≈ 1.7 THz [23, 24],
were used as both pump and probe sources using the
conﬁguration described in Ref.[33].

The equilibrium THz conductivity studies were per-
formed by recording the THz electric ﬁelds transmitted
through the sample (ﬁlm on substrate), Etr(t(cid:48)), and the
reference (bare substrate), Ere(t(cid:48)), using the Pockels ef-
fect in GaP. The bandwidth was limited to below 2.5
THz by the TO-Phonon of the LSGO. The complex op-
tical conductivity σ(ω) = σ1(ω) + iσ2(ω) was obtained
[34] using the Fresnel equations. The normal state σ(ω)
can be well approximated by the Drude model, giving the
plasma frequency νp = 190 THz and the scattering rate
τ−1 = 2.2 THz, in good agreement with infrared stud-
ies on thick ﬁlms [25, 26]. To estimate the magnitude of
2∆, we follow the approach of Ref.[26], where 2∆ was ex-
tracted from the reﬂectivity, by reading out the position
in the reﬂectance spectra, below which the reﬂectivity
starts to rise steeply above its normal state value. To
do so, we used the measured σ(ω, T ), calculated the cor-
responding bulk reﬂectivity R(ω, T ), and plot R(ω, T )−

maximum gap frequency 2∆/ ≈ 1.7 THz (∆ = 3.5
meV), in good agreement with other studies on c-axis
ﬁlms [23, 26]. Unlike in the BCS case [16], 2∆ displays
only weak T-dependence.

In optical-pump – THz probe experiments, the ﬁlm is
excited by a 50 fs near-infrared (NIR) pump pulse cen-
tered at 800 nm. The transient spectral conductivity
σ(ω, td) was measured as a function of time delay td be-
tween the pump and the THz probe pulse. The quenching
of the SC state is found to proceed on a timescale of sev-
eral ps, while the SC state recovery was on a timescale of
100’s of ps. For time delays td longer than the char-
acteristic e-e and e-ph thermalization times (both on
the order of 1 ps) we ﬁnd that the measured σ(ω, td)
can be matched to the equilibrium σ(ω) recorded at a
speciﬁc temperature T ∗ [34], i.e. σ(ω, td) ≈ σ(ω, T ∗).
This is consistent with the so called T∗-model, where
in non-equilibrium the population of QPs, Cooper pairs

and high-frequency (ω > 2∆) bosons are in a quasi-
equilibrium at a temperature T∗, which is larger than
the base temperature T of ω < 2∆ modes.

To study the excitation density dependence of the SC
state dynamics over large range of excitation densities
we recorded the induced changes in the transmitted THz
electric ﬁeld at a ﬁxed t(cid:48) = t0 as a function of td,
∆Etr(t0, td), as in Ref.
[16]. As shown in Fig. 1(a)-
(c) the transmitted electric ﬁeld Etr(t(cid:48)) depends strongly
on temperature. In particular, for the chosen t0 - see Fig.
1 - Etr(t0, T ) shows a linear T-dependence over a large
T-range below Tc.

tion coeﬃcient of PCCO at 800 nm, which we have mea-
sured. It follows from the data that both, SC state de-

pletion and recovery depend on excitation density. Simi-
lar observations have been made on MgB2 [17] and NbN
[16], and could be well accounted by the phenomenolog-
ical Rothwarf-Taylor model [15]. In particular, the slow
timescale for depletion of the SC state (for lowest excita-
tion densities several 10s of ps!) and its excitation density
dependence can be attributed to Cooper pair-breaking by
ω > 2∆ bosons generated during the relaxation of high
energy quasiparticles towards the gap [15–17].

Here, we focus on the energetics of the SC state de-
pletion. We chose ∆Etr(t0, td = 30 ps) to determine
the change in eﬀective temperature T∗ as a function of
excitation density. The link to T∗ is provided by the
T-dependence of ∆Etr(t0, T ) in equilibrium shown in
Fig. 1(c); we used linear interpolation for low excita-
tion densities. The relative change in T∗, δT∗/(Tc−T),
as a function of ANIR is shown in Fig. 2(b). For low
ANIR the induced changes scale with ANIR, yet show-

We further studied the SC state quenching in PCCO
using intense THz pulses. This way the electronic system
is excited directly, with quasiparticles having small excess
energy. A single-color pump probe scheme was used [33].
The T-dependence of transmission intensity (T r) in equi-
librium is shown in inset to Fig. 3(a). The measurements
agree with the transfer-matrix method (TMM) calcula-
tion based on the optical conductivity data obtained by
broadband THz spectroscopy [34].

Figure 3(a) presents the time-evolution of the nor-
malized pump-induced changes in transmission (δT r)
recorded for several Athz. The shaded area corresponds
to the intensity cross-correlation of THz pulses. Unlike
in the NIR-pump experiments, no SC state suppression
dynamics beyond the THz pump pulse duration is ob-
served, despite the fact that the lowest excitation densi-
ties were an order of magnitude lower than in the NIR
pump study. This clearly demonstrates diﬀerent exci-
tation mechanisms. While by pumping with THz pho-
tons with νFEL > 2∆/ Cooper pairs are broken di-
rectly, by NIR pumping Cooper pairs are broken mainly
by ω > 2∆ bosons generated during the cascade of high
energy quasiparticles towards the gap edge.

Assuming the T∗-approximation as for NIR pumping,
we convert the maximum induced changes in T r into

the condensate. We should note that no signiﬁcant vari-
ation of Adep on base temperature is observed. This is
dep (cid:29) Ec, and
not surprising for NIR pumping, where ANIR
≤ 20% of absorbed energy is used for condensate deple-
tion. The fact that similar is observed by THz pumping
is puzzling. We speculate that this may be linked to the
enhancement of SC due to nonequilibrium electron dis-
tribution as observed in NbN [33].
The observation that in PCCO in the low-T limit
dep (cid:29) ATHz
dep ≈ Ec implies, quite generally, that the
ANIR
Eliashberg coupling function strongly depends on the
electron energy. The electron-boson spectral function
α2F (ε, ε(cid:48), Ω), where ε and ε(cid:48) are the electronic and
Ω the bosonic energy,
is commonly approximated by
α2F (εF , εF , Ω) = α2F (Ω), since it is customary to as-
sume that its variation on ε and ε(cid:48) on the energy scale
smaller than the electronic bandwidth can be neglected
[30]. Our result, that by NIR pumping most of the en-
ergy is transferred to bosonic excitations, which at the
same time do not couple to the condensate, suggests the
failure of the above assumption in cuprates. This implies
that α2F changes dramatically on the energy scale of (a
few) 100 meV.

Considering the possible scenarios of superconductivity
being mediated by the phonons or magnetic excitations,
the results suggest that high energy electrons strongly
couple to phonons (or magnetic modes), while the situ-
ation is reversed at low energies. Here, by high energy
we refer to ≈ 100 meV, since for energies of the order
of the NIR photon energy the e-e scattering dominates
the e-boson scattering thereby substantially reducing the
average electron excess energy on the timescale of a few
fs [37]. Presuming the situation is similar in both elec-
tron and hole doped cuprates, and taking into account
the result that NIR pumping in YBCO results in a rapid
e-ph energy transfer [21], this result may suggest that
pairing in cuprates is mediated by magnetic excitations.
Alternatively, we could assume that high energy electrons
emit magnetic excitation on the fs timescale [38]. If so,
these nonequilibrium magnetic excitations are almost un-
coupled from the condensate and therefore do not act as
pair-breakers.

Note that the proposed scenario is based on a very
simple observation that the excitations created by the
high energy electrons are poorly coupled to the conden-
sate. Therefore the relaxation times due to this coupling
is longer than the anharmonic decay of these excitations.
As a result Rothwarf and Taylor bottleneck [15] is not
operational for these excitations.

In summary, we present photoinduced THz conductiv-
ity dynamics in the electron-doped cuprate PCCO, fo-
cusing on melting the SC state with both NIR and THz
pulses. The absorbed energy density required for SC
state depletion, Adep, was found to match the condensa-
tion energy when pumping with narrow band THz pulses.

within errorbars identical to Ec. This implies that al-
most all of the deposited energy is directly used for con-
densate depletion and only a miniscule amount of energy
is transferred into the bosonic system. Since the recovery
dynamics is identical for the two excitation processes, and
can be attributed to the boson-bottleneck scenario, some
energy has to be transferred to the ω > 2∆ bosonic
modes. However, due to the detailed balance [15, 17]
between the QP density, nqp ∝ exp (−∆/kBT ), and the
ω > 2∆ boson density, nb ∝ exp (−2∆/kBT ), where
nb ∝ n2
qp , the energy stored in the latter is negligible for
∆ > kBT .

Figure 4 summarizes the dependence of Adep on the
pump photon energy and T. The observation that the
low-T value of ATHz
dep matches Ec is consistent with ex-
pectations. Far more surprising is the result of the
NIR pumping. Considering the fast condensate deple-
tion times and speciﬁc heats of diﬀerent bosonic subsys-
tems (phonons, spin ﬂuctuations), the observation in hole

ing a rapid electron-boson energy transfer takes place,
yet only selected bosonic modes (e.g. antiferromagnetic
ﬂuctuations, or speciﬁc lattice modes) do couple to the

energy is varied over a large energy range, and supported
by theoretical modelling are clearly required in cuprates,
as well as in other systems with competing orders.
