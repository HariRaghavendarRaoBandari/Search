Abstract. We present here our results on the hour like time scale X-
ray ﬂux variations in a sample of active galactic nuclei using data from
the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). We ﬁnd that in the
3−79 keV band, BL Lacs are more variable than ﬂat spectrum radio quasars
and Seyfert galaxies. Among Seyferts, Seyfert 2s are more variable than
Seyfert 1s. Also, radio-loud quasars are more variable in the hard (10−79
keV) band than the soft (3−10 keV) band while, Seyfert galaxies tend to
show more variations in the soft band relative to the hard band.

Introduction

A distinctive property of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is that they show ﬂux variations
over the entire electromagnetic spectrum over a wide range of timescales. Among the
various wavelengths, hard X-rays are less aﬀected by absorption, and thus, by explor-
ing hard X-ray ﬂux variability, one can put strong constraints on the physics in the
innermost regions of AGN that are not resolvable using any existing imaging facilit-
ies. At hard X-ray wavelengths, until recently, we have knowledge only on the long
term variability properties of AGN, that too for a limited number of sources mainly
from Swift/BAT and RXTE/PCA observations. With the availability of the hard X-ray
focussing telescope, NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) since June 2012, it is now pos-
sible to probe the hard X-ray ﬂux variations in AGN on a wide range of time scales.
Here, we have carried out a systematic study on the hard X-ray variability properties
of a sample of AGN on hour like time scales using observations from NuSTAR.

2. Sample, data reduction and analysis

Our sample consists of 71 AGN, which includes 4 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), 3 ﬂat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 24 Seyfert 1 galaxies and 40 Seyfert 2 galaxies.
Data have been processed using the NuSTAR Data Analysis Software (NuSTARDAS)
v.1.4.1, following standard procedures and using the CALDB version 20141107. A
circular region of 60′′ was taken to extract the source and background counts on the
same detector. Light curves were generated in the soft (3−10 keV), hard (10−79
keV) and total (3−79 keV) X-ray bands. A sample light curve is shown in Fig. 1.
To characterise ﬂux variations, we have used the normalized excess variance (Fvar)
following Vaughan et al. (2003). Distribution of Fvar for the diﬀerent types of sources
in the 3−79 keV band is shown in Fig. 1.

3. Results

Our conclusions are (i) all source in our sample showed X-ray variations, (ii) radio
loud sources are more variable in the hard band compared to the soft band while
Seyfert galaxies vary more in the soft band, (iii) among radio-loud sources, BL Lacs
are more variable than FSRQs both in soft and hard bands and (iv) among Seyferts,
Seyfert 2s are more variable than Seyfert 1s in both soft and hard X-ray bands.
