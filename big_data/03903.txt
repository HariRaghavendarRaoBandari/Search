Abstract

The parameters of the seasonal modulations (variations) in the
intensity of muons and cosmogenic neutrons generated by them at
a mean muon energy of 280 GeV have been determined in the LVD
(Large Volume Detector) experiment. The modulations of muons and
neutrons are caused by a temperature eﬀect, the seasonal temperature
and density variations of the upper atmospheric layers. The analysis
performed here leads to the conclusion that the variations in the mean
energy of the muon ﬂux are the main source of underground cosmo-
genic neutron variations, because the energy of muons is more sensitive
to the temperature eﬀect than their intensity. The parameters of the
seasonal modulations in the mean energy of muons and the ﬂux of
cosmogenic neutrons at the LVD depth have been determined from
the data obtained over seven years of LVD operation.

Introduction

At present, the correlation between the annual modulations in the counting
rate of events observed in dark matter particle search experiments [1], [2], [3],
[4] and the seasonal variations in the underground muon ﬂux is being actively
discussed. The muon intensity variations at great depths are considered as
a possible source of the seasonal modulations of events in low-background

1

detectors. It is assumed that the modulations can be produced by cosmogenic
neutrons whose ﬂux is linearly related to the varying muon ﬂux.

The cause of the seasonal muon variations at sea level and underground
is well known [5], [6], [7]. This is a temperature eﬀect that leads to a change
in the density of the terrestrial atmosphere and its height as a result of its
heating in summer and cooling in winter. On the one hand, a decrease in the
density of the upper atmospheric layers (stratosphere) through expansion
when heated leads to an increase in the probability of the π → µ decays
of ﬁrst generation charged pions from extensive air showers (EASs) and to
a corresponding decrease in the number of pions (and the number of their
decays π → µ) in the last generations. On the other hand, the atmosphere
expansion increases the probability of the µ → e decays of low energy muons
on their way to the Earth. The ﬁrst fact, an increase in the probability of the
decays π → µ, gives a positive temperature eﬀect observed in the high energy
muon ﬂux. The last two facts associated with low energy muons lead to a
negative temperature eﬀect, a reduction in the muon intensity at sea level,
where the mean muon energy is ∼ 4 GeV. The observed muon variations
are determined by the combined action of the negative and positive eﬀects.
The negative component dominates approximately down to 20 meters water
equivalent (m w.e.). Its contribution is decreased with a depth increasing and
becomes negligible starting from approximately 200 m w.e. (Eµ = 35 GeV).
Muons at energies above 1 TeV produced at pA-interaction energies above
100 TeV can reach depths greater than 2 km w.e. The positive temperature
eﬀect is clearly observed at large underground facilities [8], [9], [10].

In the LVD [11] experiment the parameters of seasonal variations both
muon intensity and number of neutrons produced by muons for a ﬁxed time
interval (60 days) in LVD structure were determined. The puzzle of the data
obtained is inequality of amplitudes of the neutron number modulation and
modulation of muon intensity: the ﬁrst is about 10 times greater than the
second one. This problem can be solved by assuming seasonal variations of
the muon ﬂux mean energy which determines the neutron production.

The positive temperature eﬀect increases the probability of the decays
of ﬁrst pion generations in EAS. This must lead not only to a rise in the
intensity of muons at great depths but also to an increase in their mean
energy. Below, we will estimate the seasonal variations in the mean muon
energy and the variations in the number of neutrons produced by muons
using the LVD data [9], [11].

2 The Determining of the number of muon-

induced neutrons in the LVD

The Large Volume Detector (LVD) is described in detail in [9], [12], [13].
The main objective of the detector is to search for neutrino bursts from the
gravitational stellar core collapse.

The muon intensity at the LVD depth is I 0

µ = (3.31 ± 0.03) × 10−4m−2s−1
[14]. The threshold muon energy to reach the LVD depth is 1.3 TeV [12].
The ionization losses of a vertical muon in the LVD structure are, on average,
∼ 2.2 GeV. The criteria for the selection of muon events from all the detected
events specify the muon rate in each tower ∼ 1.2 min−1. The mean energies
of single muons and muons in pairs are (270 ± 18) and (381 ± 21) GeV,
respectively [15]. Single muons account for ∼ 90% of the number of muon
events. The mean energy of the muon ﬂux is Eµ = 280 GeV. Below, we will
use this value.

Neutrons are produced by muons in the LVD scintillator and the elements
of its steel structure. The detection eﬃciency of neutrons produced in the
scintillator and uniformly distributed in a counter volume is ∼ 50%. Neu-
trons produced in iron are detected with an eﬃciency of ∼ 20%. The delayed
coincidence method is used to determine the number of generated neutrons:
γ-quanta from capture of a neutron by a free proton in the scintillator or by
an iron nucleus in the steel structure are detected in a time interval of 1 ms
after the muon passage through the LVD.

The counters through which the muon passed and those adjacent to them
are included in the analysis. The time distribution of pulses summed over all
muons and counters is described by a function N(t) = N0exp(−t/τγ)+B. N0
is determined at constant B specifying the background of measurements and
known time τγ = 180µs. The product N0τγ gives the number of detected γ-
quanta in the time interval from 0 to ∞ Using N0τγ and taking into account
the neutron detection eﬃciency (including the γ-quanta detection eﬃciency),
we obtain the number of neutrons produced in the selected muon events.

3 Seasonal modulations in the mean energy
of the muon ﬂux and muon-induced neu-
trons

The time dependence Iµ(t) of the muon ﬂux per day over eight years of LVD
operation (21.5 × 106 muon events) starting from January 1, 2001 (Fig. 1a)
was obtained in [9]:

I µ(t) = I µ

0 + δI µcos(

2π
T

(t − tµ

0 )).

(1)

The mean intensity was (3.31 ± 0.03) × 10−4m−2s−1; the modulation period
was T = (367 ± 15) days. The phase tµ
0 = (185 ± 15) days corresponds to a
maximum muon intensity at the beginning of July. The intensity modulation
amplitude is δI µ = (5.0 ± 0.2) × 10−6m−2s−1. The derived modulation pa-
rameters are consistent with the measurements in the MACRO experiment
at the same depth as the LVD one [8]. The muon intensity measurements
at the BOREXINO facility (2007 - 2011, 4.6 × 106 muons) located near the
LVD [10] are also consistent with the LVD and MACRO parameters.

The variations in the number of neutrons generated by the muon ﬂux
in the detector material were detected at the LVD [11]. The parameters of
variations were determined using the LVD data from April 1, 2003, to April
1, 2010. To increase the statistics, the number of muon-induced neutrons was
determined with a step of 60 days (Fig. 1b). When ﬁtting the experimental
data by a function

N(t) = N0 + δNcos(

2π
T

(t − tn

0 ))

(2)

the best agreement of the ﬁtting curve with the experimental data points
is achieved at the following parameters of the function: N0 = 65.0 ± 2.2,
δN = 9.3 ± 3.9, T = 1 yr, and tn
0 = 185 ± 18 days. The derived phase agrees
with the phase of muon variations tµ

0 [11].

The maximum relative increase in the number of neutrons is

kn =

= 1 +

= 1.143.

A similar value can be obtained for the muon intensity using the parameters
of function (1):

eration. (b) The number of neutrons from muons per counter; each point

n = 1.015.

It has been pointed out above that the number of neutrons detected by the
LVD in 60 days must depend both on the number of muons passed through
the detector in this time and on their energy. In such a case,

whence

kn = kI

kE
n =

(4)

(5)

kE
n is a coeﬃcient that allows for the maximum change in energy Eµ. It is
well known that the dependence of the number of neutrons on muon energy
can be described by a power law Eα

µ , consequently,

kE
n = (

Emax
µ
Eµ

)α.

(6)

Hence we determine the maximum mean energy of the muon ﬂux (summer
value) as a function of the yearly mean Eµ:

Emax

µ = (kE

n )1/αEµ.

(7)

The quantity α has been investigated theoretically and experimentally; it is
limited by 0.7 and 0.8 [16], [17], [18]. The best agreement with the experi-
mental data on the neutron yield is observed at α = 0.78 [19]. Substituting
this value into (7), we ﬁnd at Eµ = 280 GeV that Emax
µ = 326 GeV. Thus,
assuming that the seasonal variations of the muon energy and intensity have
the same origin and that the deviations Emax
are equal
(because α is close to 1), we obtain the time dependence of the energy Eµ(t)
averaged over the muon ﬂux in general form:

− Eµ and Eµ − Emin

µ

µ

Eµ(t) = Eµ + δEµcos[

2π
T

(t − tµ

0 )].

(8)

At the LVD depth, Eµ = 280 GeV and δEµ = 46 GeV; the relative mod-
ulation amplitude of the energy averaged over the muon ﬂux is 16%. The
derived amplitude δEµ = 46 GeV has an uncertainty of ∼ 60%, which is
attributable mainly to the error in δN, ∼ 40%.

Being dependent on the intensity I µ and energy Eµ, the neutron ﬂux
also undergoes seasonal variations. The annual mean neutron ﬂux at a given
depth H is expressed by the formula

F0(H)[n · cm−2s−1] = I µ

0 (H)Y (Eµ)λn,

(9)

I µ
0 (H)[µ · cm−2s−1] is the annual mean global muon intensity at depth H;
Y (Eµ, A)[n/µ/(g · cm−2)] is the cosmogenic neutron yield in a material with
mass number A at muon energy [GeV] corresponding to this depth; λn[g ·
cm−2] is the cosmogenic neutron attenuation length (∼ 40g · cm−2 for stan-
dard rock A = 22, Z = 11). Using the formula for the neutron yield obtained
in [19],

Y (Eµ, A) = bE

0.78
µ A0.95, b = 4.4 × 10−7cm2g−1,

(10)

we arrive at an expression for the neutron ﬂux in a material with mass number
A:

F0(H) = bλnI µ

0 (H)E

0.78
µ A0.95.

(11)

6

Taking into account kn = 1.143, we obtain an expression for the seasonal
modulations in the ﬂux of cosmogenic neutrons at the LVD depth H0 pro-
duced in material A:

F0(t) = F0(H0)[1 + 0.143cos(

2π
T

(t − tn

0 ))].

(12)

An enhancement of the annual modulations in the cosmogenic neutron ﬂux
compared to the muon ﬂux arouses a desire to associate the signal modu-
lations in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment [20] with them. The diﬀerence in
the modulation phases of the neutron ﬂux tn
0 = 185 ± 18 days (the maximum
occurs at the beginning of July) and the DAMA/LIBRA signal tD/L
0 = 152.5
days (the maximum occurs on June 2) contradicts this.

4 Conclusions

The variations δEµ in the mean energy of the muon ﬂux are the main source
of seasonal variations in the underground cosmogenic neutron ﬂux. The rel-
ative amplitude of the neutron variations related to δEµ exceeds the relative
modulation amplitude δIµ by an order of magnitude. This is explained by
a stronger dependence of the energy on the temperature eﬀect than that for
Iµ.

Taking into account the dependence of the temperature coeﬃcient αT on
depth (the decrease of αT with decreasing depth), which relates the seasonal
muon intensity variations ∆I µ/I µ to the atmospheric temperature variations
∆T /T [4], [6], [8], one should expect a corresponding depth dependence of
the coeﬃcient kE

n and, as a consequence, Emax

.

µ

Apart from the seasonal modulations, the temperature of the upper at-
mospheric layers undergoes irregular variations over a year. As a result, the
number of neutrons produced by muons underground deviates considerably
from the harmonic function (2) with a breakdown of the constancy of the
modulation amplitude δN and the ﬂuctuation phase tn
0 . This should be taken
into account when analyzing the background in low-background underground
experiments.
