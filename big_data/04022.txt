ABSTRACT
3D atmosphere model results are used to comparatively study the kinetic, non-
equilibrium cloud formation in the atmospheres of two example planets guided by
the giant gas planets HD 209 458b and HD 189 733b. Rather independently of hydro-
dynamic model diﬀerences, our cloud modelling suggests that both planets are covered
in mineral clouds throughout the entire modelling domain. Both planets harbour chem-
ically complex clouds that are made of mineral particles that have a height-dependent
material composition and size. The remaining gas-phase element abundances strongly
eﬀects the molecular abundances of the atmosphere in the cloud forming regions. Hy-
drocarbon and cyanopolyyne molecules can be rather abundant in the inner, dense
part of the atmospheres of HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b. No one value for metallicity
and the C/O ratio can be used to describe an extrasolar planet. Our results concern-
ing the presence and location of water in relation to the clouds explain some of the
observed diﬀerences between the two planets. In HD 189 733b, strong water features
have been reported while such features are less strong for HD 209 458b. By considering
the location of the clouds in the two atmospheres, we see that obscuring clouds exist
high in the atmosphere of HD 209 458b, but much deeper in HD 189 733b. We further
conclude that the (self-imposed) degeneracy of cloud parameters in retrieval methods
can only be lifted if the cloud formation processes are accurately modelled in contrast
to prescribing them by independent parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION

HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b are the two most observed ex-
trasolar planets. Both planets are highly irradiated due to
their close proximity to their host star. HD 189 733b forms
a bow shock in the wind of its host star (Llama et al. 2013)
from which the planetary magnetic ﬁeld strength can be de-
rived. Cauley et al. (2015) obtained HIRES observations in
Hα which suggest a magnetic ﬁeld strength of 28G for the
giant gas planet HD 189 733b. Chandra observations (0.1 - 5
keV) indicate a deeper X-ray transit than for optical wave-
lengths (Poppenhaeger et al. 2013), but see Llama & Shkol-
nik 2015 for the eﬀect of stellar variability. Lecavelier Des
Etangs et al. (2010) presented the ﬁrst study of HD 189 733b
mass loss based on HST transit observations, later conﬁrmed
in (Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2012). HARPS observations

of blue-shifted Na D lines (8 ± 2 km s−1) in the upper
layers of the atmosphere above a cloud deck (Wyttenbach
et al. 2015) enabled the spatial resolution of an eastward
wind on HD 189 733b (Louden & Wheatley 2015) indicat-
ing a globally circulating atmosphere (Showman et al. 2008;
Dobbs-Dixon & Agol 2013). The presence of H2O is sug-
gested by dayside emission spectrum (Grillmair et al. 2008),
secondary eclipse emission spectrum (Todorov et al. 2014;
Crouzet et al. 2014), transit absorption spectrum (McCul-
lough et al. 2014) and by ground-based high-resolution spec-
troscopy (Birkby et al. 2013). Swain et al. (2014) ﬁnd strong
evidence for CH4 absorption in their NICMOS transmission
spectra and interpret this ﬁnding as a conﬁrmation of ear-
lier publications on the detection of CH4 in the atmosphere
of HD 189 733b. Rodler et al. (2013) present the detection
of CO at the HD 189 733b day-side from NIRSPEC obser-
vations (see also D´esert et al. 2009; de Kok et al. 2013).
Knutson et al. (2012) require a vertical mixing enhance-

ment of CO to explain their Spitzer observations. de Kok
et al. (2013) could not conﬁrm CO2 NICMOS secondary
eclipse observation. The eﬀorts of deriving observational
constraints on the atmosphere chemistry are challenged by
the repeated detection of a thick cloud layer on HD 189 733b
through transit spectroscopy (Gibson et al. 2012; Pont et al.
2013). Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. (2008) were the ﬁrst to
use MgSiO3[s] as a possible abundant condensate with par-
ticle size ≈ 10−2 . . . 0.1µm based on transit observations
with ACS on Hubble. Retrieval methods were applied to re-
ﬂectance spectra to provide further insight in chemical com-
position of the atmosphere and cloud properties (Barstow
et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Benneke 2015).

The ﬁrst mass loss detection on HD 209 458b was made
by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003) and Vidal-Madjar et al.
(2004) suggesting the escape of HI, OI and CII. Vidal-
Madjar et al. (2013) report absorption in MgI in a re-
gion where atmospheric escape is suggested to take place.
4.5µm Spitzer/IRAC data imply the presence of a hot spot
shifted eastward by ≈ 40o and a day-night-side tempera-
ture diﬀerence of ≈ 500K (Zellem et al. 2014). The analysis
of Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera primary transit and sec-
ondary eclipse light curves (Evans et al. 2015) did not con-
ﬁrm the detection of water in HD 209 458b, but suggest a
depletion of atmospheric CO and no thermal inversion layer
to be detectable at Spitzer wavelengths (also Diamond-Lowe
et al. 2014). However, the Hubble observation at 1.4µm by
Deming et al. (2013) provides evidence for H2O absorption
in HD 209 458b which was conﬁrmed by Sing et al. (2016).
Schwarz et al. (2015) observed the thermal dayside emis-
sion by high-resolution spectroscopy of the carbon monox-
ide band at 2.3 µm. They do not ﬁnd any emission signature
required to conﬁrm a thermal inversion in the atmosphere
of HD 209 458b. Hoeijmakers et al. (2015) suggest that their
TiO opacity data was insuﬃcient to reach any conclusion
regarding a thermal inversion on HD 209 458b. These con-
clusions, however, are based on the assumption that the
featured molecules are associated with a thermal inversion
and not with another process that aﬀects, for example, their
abundance. The presence of TiO and VO is derived from
STISS observation of HD 209 458b (D´esert et al. 2008). It
is suggested that TiO and VO exist in two distinct layers
including one at higher atmospheric layers above the S = 1-
level where potential condensates would be thermally sta-
ble1. This conclusion about the presence of gaseous TiO or
VO, however, can only be correct if the layer above S = 1
is warmer such that S < 1, i.e. in a case of an outward tem-
perature increase. Koskinen et al. (2013) conclude that the
detection of Si2+ indicates that clouds involving Si do not
form in the atmosphere of HD 209 458b.

Both planets have been compared regarding the in-
terplay between the irradiation and the atmosphere dy-
namics and its eﬀect on the molecular gas composition
(Ag´undez et al. 2012, 2014), regarding their mass loss (Bour-
rier & Lecavelier des Etangs 2013), and their cloud-free dy-

evaporation rates are equal, hence when thermal stability, or
phase equilibrium, is achieved. The supersaturation ratio is de-
ﬁnes as S(T ) = px(Tgas, pgas)/psat,s(Ts) with px(Tgas partial
pressure of the gas species x, and psat,s(Ts) is the saturation
vapour pressure of the (e.g. solid) material s.

namic atmosphere structure (Showman et al. 2009a). Ben-
neke (2015) suggests from his retrieval procedure that both
planets, HD 209 458b and HD 189 733b host a thick cloud
deck. Our paper takes this approach further to present a
comparative study of the cloud structures of HD 209 458b
and HD 189 733b based on kinetic simulation of the non-
equilibrium cloud forming processes in combination with re-
sults of 3D atmosphere structure simulations. We, however,
note that our present approach is limited by the need to
run the cloud-formation and 3D RHD simulations indepen-
dently.

Every observation requires input from a model. In-
terpretations of all observations
for HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b rely on various modelling approaches which
mostly only include a subset of physics complexes like radia-
tive transfer incl. gas and cloud opacities, gas-phase chem-
istry (kinetic or LTE), hydrodynamics (HD), magnetohydro-
dynamics (MHD), and cloud formation. The radiative trans-
fer problem and the gas-phase chemical abundances have
achieved rather high standards as core problems of atmo-
sphere modelling and data analysis (see review by Marley &
Robinson 2015, also Benneke 2015). HD and MHD have a
long standing tradition in meteorology and in solar physics,
respectively. Cloud formation, in contrast, is almost always
parameterised in terms of number and sizes of particles, set-
tling and mixing eﬃciencies in complex simulations like as
part of radiative transfer simulations or circulation models
(see e.g. Charnay et al. 2015). Parameterisation approaches
have been guided by terrestrial studies, which however, treat
an environment that does not compare overly well with giant
gas planets. Main diﬀerences are the chemical composition
of the atmospheric gas and the need to treat the formation of
condensation seeds in situ (see review by Helling & Fomins
2013, also Sect. 3 in Helling & Casewell 2014). We therefore
aim to provide some guidance for future cloud parameterisa-

tions based on the examples HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b
for other planets as needed in preparation of JWST.

This paper applies a kinetic cloud formation model to
study and compare the cloud structures of the two exam-
ple extrasolar giant gas planets HD 189 733b & HD 209 458b
based on global circulation models of their dynamic atmo-
spheres (Dobbs-Dixon & Agol 2013; Mayne et al. 2014a)
which were run for 600 and 1800 Earth days, respectively.
All local cloud properties (number, size and material compo-
sition of cloud particles, depleted element abundances, cloud
opacity) are determined by the local thermo- and hydrody-
namic properties. We aim to demonstrate and to compare
the consistently calculated cloud structures for both planets
and the chemical feedback on the background atmosphere
gas. Section 2 outlines our approach. Section 4 presents
the local thermodynamic properties of the atmospheres of
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b in comparison. Section 5 dis-
cusses the resulting local cloud properties for the two giant
gas planets with focus on the changing cloud material and
grain sizes across the globe as major opacity input. Section 6
compares the impact of cloud formation on the local chem-
istry for HD 189 733b and HD 209 458 and how it changes
with longitude as result of the underlying atmosphere struc-
ture. The changing element abundances and the molecular
composition are discussed with the resulting inhomogenous
metallicity and C/O ratio throughout an atmosphere with
clouds. We also discuss the abundance of larger hydrocar-
bon and cyanopolyyne molecules in the inner atmosphere.
Section 7 compares the opacities for the day and the night
side of both planets. Section 8 presents our discussion and
Sect. 9 concludes this paper.

2 APPROACH

We apply the two-model approach outlined in Lee et al.
(2015a). We extract 1D (Tgas(z), pgas(z), vz(z))-trajectories
from 3D HD atmosphere simulations across the globe and
use these structures as input for our kinetic, non-equilibrium
cloud-formation code Drift (Woitke & Helling 2003, 2004;
Helling & Woitke 2006; Helling et al. 2008). The 3D results
for HD 189 733b are from the 3D radiation-hydrodynamic
simulation by Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013), the 3D results
for HD 209 458b are from the 3D GCM simulations by Mayne
et al. (2014a) and Amundsen et al. (2014). We refer to the
individual papers regarding more details on the 3D simula-
tions and also the cloud formation modelling. A summary
of the diﬀerent modelling parts and of our assumptions is
given below. The approach that this paper follows has the
limitation of not taking into account the potential eﬀect of
horizontal winds on the cloud formation. We note, however,
that the cloud formation processes are determined by the
local thermodynamic properties which are the result of the
3D dynamic atmosphere simulations in our approach. Hor-
izontal winds would aﬀect the cloud formation profoundly
if the horizontal wind time-scale would be of the order of
the time-scales of the microscopic cloud formation processes.
We have demonstrated that this is not the case in Lee et al.
(2015a). Woitke & Helling (2003) have shown that latent
heat release in negligible for the condensation of the ma-
terials considered here. However, a complete and consistent
coupling of our non-equilibrium cloud formation model with

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

a full 3D radiative hydrodynamics is most desirable to study
the cloud formation aﬀects in considerably more details than
our present approach allows. We further note that some of
the results from Lee et al. (2015a) are reproduced in the
present paper for the beneﬁt of the reader.

2.1 Kinetic formation of cloud particles from

oxygen-rich gases

Cloud formation in extrasolar atmospheres requires the for-
mation of seed particles because giant gas planets have no
crust from which sand or ash particles are diﬀused upwards
or injected into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions. These
condensation seeds provide a surface onto which other mate-
rials can condense more easily as surface reactions are con-
siderably more eﬃcient than the sum of chemical gas phase
reactions leading to the formation of the seed. The formation
of the ﬁrst surface out of the gas phase proceeds by a num-
ber of subsequent chemical reactions that eventually result
in small seed particles. Such a chain of chemical reactions
can proceed by adding a molecular unit during each reac-
tion step (e.g., Jeong et al. 2000; Plane 2013). Goumans &
Bromley (2012), for example, show that condensation occurs
from small gas-phase constituent like MgO and SiO, which
will lead to the formation of bigger units like Mg2SiO4 dur-
ing the condensation process. It is important to realise that
big molecules like Mg2SiO4 or Ca4Ti3O10 do not exist in
the gas phase (compare also Sect. 6). Here, the concept of
homogeneous nucleation is applied to model the formation
of TiO2 seed particles (Helling & Fomins 2013; Lee et al.
2015b) which allows us to calculate the nucleation rate, J∗
[cm−3 s−1], which determines the number of cloud particles,
nd [cm−3], and therefore inﬂuences the total cloud surface.
The cloud particle size, (cid:104)a(cid:105) [cm], is determined by the eﬃ-
ciency of surface growth and evaporation reactions. These
reactions are determined by the composition of the gas phase
that provides the number density for surface reactions (Ta-
ble 1 in Helling et al. 2008) and leads to the formation of a
substantial material mantle on top of the seed. This man-
tle determines the mass, volume (Vtot) and main chemical
composition, Vs/Vtot (Vs - volume fraction of material s), of
the cloud particles. Many materials can be simultaneously
thermally stable in a gas but these materials change depend-
ing on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio and the abundance ratios
of other elements. In principle, all thermally stable mate-
rials grow simultaneously on a seed particle as long as the
key species (e.g. TiO for TiO2[s]; SiO, Mg, SiS, Mg(OH)2
for Mg2SiO4[s]; CaO, CaS, TiO for CaTiO3[s]) are present in
the gas phase. Our cloud model includes 12 solid species that
form from 60 gas-solid surface reactions (Table 1 in Helling
et al. 2008). These are the solids that are expected to pro-
vide the most eﬃcient growth materials and include silicates
(MgSiO3[s], Mg2SiO4[s], SiO[s], SiO2[s]), metals and metal
oxides (MgO[s], Fe[s], FeO[s], Fe2O3[s], Al2O3[s], TiO2[s],
CaTiO3[s]) and others (FeS[s]). Internal rearrangement may
lead to the formation of Ca2Al2SiO7[s] or MgAl2O4[s] which
are long living minerals that, however, can not form directly
from the gas phase. The life time of any of the cloud par-
ticles might, however, be too short for such rearrangement
processes to have any eﬀect.

Once cloud particles have formed, they are aﬀected by
gravity and friction with the surrounding gas. The equilib-

stars are summarized in Table 1.

rium between friction and gravity determine how strongly
the cloud particles are coupled to the gas and, hence, how
fast the cloud particles fall through the atmosphere (Woitke
& Helling 2003). This gravitational settling determines the
vertical extension of a cloud. The cloud particles will con-
tinue to grow and to change their material composition dur-
ing their descent into denser and warmer atmospheric re-
gions. Mineral cloud particles can reach a size for which
they fall faster than they can grow, hence, the cloud parti-
cle will not change any more in size and composition (Woitke
& Helling 2004). The cloud formation has a strong impact
on the local chemistry by depleting those elements that par-
ticipate in the formation of the cloud particles. This will
result in an inhomogeneous metallicity and C/O ratio of the
atmosphere (see Sect. 6.1).

If nucleation and growth become ineﬃcient, large-scale

processes like gravitational settling determine the global
cloud formation (Sect. 6 in Woitke & Helling 2003). The loss
of elements over large-scales is counter balanced by the (ver-
tical) mixing processes (see Sect. 2.4.2. in Lee et al. 2015a).
Diﬀerent approaches are applied in the literature to account
for vertical mixing. For example, Ackerman & Marley (2001)
use an equation where gravitational settling is balanced by
cloud material diﬀusion. The local amount of cloud mate-
rial is then derived for a given settling parameter (fsed) and
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (Kzz, see pg 5 in Lee et al. 2015a for
a discussion). It remains to prescribe the material compo-
sition and a grain size distribution (like Eq. 2 in Morley
et al. 2015). The approach presented in Woitke & Helling
(2003), and utilized in this paper, applies to force balance
between friction and gravity to derive a size-dependent drift
velocity which is required to determine a drift dependent

growth term in the moment equations. The vertical mixing
eﬃciency enters by a mixing time scale that is derived from
the local gas velocity. Beside the local element abundances,
Tgas(z) and ρgas(z) (local gas density, [g cm−3]) determine if
atmospheric clouds can form, to which sizes the cloud parti-
cles grow and of which materials they will be composed. The
gravitational settling through an atmosphere is determined
by the local gas density, ρgas(z), and the cloud particle size.
The mathematical model is formulated in terms of mo-
ment equations which describes the above physical processes
(Woitke & Helling 2003; Helling & Woitke 2006; Helling
et al. 2008; Helling & Fomins 2013).

We assume that both planets, HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b, have an oxygen-rich atmosphere of approxi-
mately solar element composition. We use the solar element
abundances as boundary and initial values for the cloud for-
mation simulation.

2.2 Chemical gas composition

We apply a chemical equilibrium (thermochemical equilib-
rium) routine to investigate the chemical composition of the
atmospheres. We use the 1D (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) trajectories
and element abundances i(z) (i=O, Ca, S, Al, Fe, Si, Mg)
depleted by the cloud formation processes. All other ele-
ments are assumed to be of solar abundance. Given that
collisional gas-phase processes dominate in the atmospheric
part of interest, we apply a chemical equilibrium routine
that allows us to provide ﬁrst estimates of the abundances
of carbon-bearing macro-molecules and small PAHs. This
approach allows us to study the gas-phase abundances at
the inner boundary of future kinetic considerations, and to
look at species not presently included in most of the cur-
rent networks (e.g. C6H6). A combination of 199 gas-phase
molecules (including 33 complex carbon-bearing molecules),
16 atoms, and various ionic species were used under the as-
sumption of LTE. Bilger et al. (2013) is an extension of the
gas-phase chemistry routine used so far in our dust cloud
formation according to Helling et al. (1996). The Grevesse
et al. (2007) solar composition is used for calculating the
gas-phase chemistry outside the metal depleted cloud lay-
ers and before cloud formation. No solid particles were in-
cluded in the chemical equilibrium calculations in contrast
to equilibrium condensation models. The inﬂuence of cloud
formation on the gas phase composition results from the re-
duced element abundances due to cloud formation and the
cloud opacity impact on the radiation ﬁeld, and hence, on
the local gas temperature and gas pressure.

We demonstrate that the gas phase composition is af-
fected by cloud formation to a degree that it should be taken
into account also as inner boundary and initial values for ki-
netic gas phase calculations for irradiated, giant gas planets.

2.3 3D atmosphere simulation

2.3.1 HD 209 458b (Mayne et al. (2014b))

The simulations of HD 209 458b we use as input were run us-
ing the adapted UK Met Oﬃce General Circulation Model
(GCM), called the Uniﬁed Model (UM). The testing and
adaptation of this model to hot Jupiter conditions is de-
tailed in Mayne et al. (2014b,c) and Amundsen et al. (2014).

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Brieﬂy, the model solves the fully compressible Euler equa-
tions,
including a height varying gravity. The equations
are solved on a longitude-latitude-height grid using a semi-
Lagrangian, semi-implicit scheme (see Mayne et al. 2014b,
for more details). The lower and upper boundaries are both
free-slip and impermeable. To represent the convective ﬂux
from the interior, an additional net upward ﬂux is added to
the black body emission from the bottom boundary (i.e. ad-
ditional to the emission required to balance the downward
radiation). This convective ﬂux corresponds to an intrinsic
temperature of 100K as determined from internal evolution
models (see Amundsen et al. 2014 for details). At the upper
(outer) boundary a so-called ghost layer is included where
the atmosphere is extrapolated to account for absorption,
scattering and emission above the dynamically modeled do-
main. The radiative transfer is solved using the two-stream
approximation and opacities treated using the correlated-k
method (see Amundsen et al. 2014, for more details). The
opacities are derived using analytic abundances for chemical
equilibrium, and no additional opacity sources are added.
The planetary parameters are selected to match observa-
tional constraints of HD 209 458b as given in Table 1. The
planet radius, however, is set to 1.259 Rjup to take into ac-
count the atmosphere contribution. Full details of the model
setup can be found in Amundsen (2015).

2.3.2 HD 189 773b (Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013))

The simulations of HD 189 733b were calculated using the
model described in Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013). This model
solves the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations cou-
pled to a two-stream radiative transfer scheme averaging
over 30 wavelength bins. The equations are solved on a lat-
itude, longitude, radius grid. The temperature and pressure
dependent molecular opacities (calculated assuming solar
composition) are supplemented by both a grey component
and a Rayleigh scattering tail to approximate the eﬀects of
clouds. Detailed observational diagnostics have been carried
out and the best-ﬁt model (utilized here) has a kinematic
viscosity of ν = 107 cm2s−1. Similar to the HD 209 458b
model, the lower boundary is slip-free and impermeable.
A heat ﬂux from the interior corresponding to a black-
body with a temperature of 170 K is assumed to be ﬂow-
ing through the interior boundary. The exterior boundary
is imposed at a density of ρ = 10−9g cm−3, is assumed to
be isothermal, and allows outﬂow. Heating is incorporated
through a spatially varying direct heating term in each of
the wavelength bins. Please refer to Dobbs-Dixon & Agol
(2013) for more details.

The 3D atmosphere simulations utilised here solve the
full 3D Navier-Stockes equations (table 2 in Mayne et al.
(2014b)) coupled with a solution of the radiative transfer
problem. The largest diﬀerence between the codes arises
from the diﬀerent methods that are employed to solve the ra-
diative transfer as input to the energy equation. The largest
uncertainty arrises from the need to prescribe opacity values
as in both cases the solution of the full gas-phase chemistry
for a potentially large number of frequencies is computa-
tional unfeasible. The diﬀerences in the radiative transfer
treatment will aﬀect the details of the local values, while
the global properties maybe less aﬀected.

2.4 Atmosphere boundaries

The hydrodynamic and radiative transfer boundary condi-
tions determine the computational domain of every atmo-
sphere simulation. In the present cases, they determine the
vertical extension towards lower pressures and temperature
diﬀerently for the two cases considered here:

– All GCMs place a top boundary at either a set height
or a pressure based usually on some value that assures nu-
meric stability. The height is increased until the contribution
of the ghost layer to the derived thermodynamic structure
(Tgas, pgas) of the atmosphere is not signiﬁcant, providing
the pressure and temperature at the upper/outer bound-
ary. This means that any signiﬁcant heating will be resolved
within the atmospheric domain simulated. It will provide
the pressure minimum and the temperature at the top of
the modelled atmosphere.

We present our comparison results for three speciﬁc
latitude-longitude (θ, φ) coordinates2 but provide the full
comparison in Sect. 6.2. The chosen (θ, φ)-pairs represent
the substellar point (θ = 0◦, φ = 0◦), and the two termina-
tors ((θ = 0◦, φ = 90◦) and (θ = 0◦, φ = 270◦)). Our (θ,
φ)-quotations follow Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013) and have
been used in Lee et al. (2015a). For visualization see Fig. 1
in Lee et al. (2015a). The day/night side coordinates used
here are as follows:
• Days side:
HD 189 733b: φ = 315o, 0o, 45o
HD 209 458b: φ = 300o, 330o, 0o, 30o, 60o
• Day/night terminator: φ = 270o, 90o
• Night side
HD 189 733b: φ = 135o, 180o, 225o
HD 209 458b: φ = 120o, 150o, 180o, 210o, 240o

3 THE GENERAL DYNAMICAL REGIME OF

THE HOT JUPITERS

The dominant dynamical feature in hot Jupiter atmospheres
is the super-rotating equatorial jet seen in the simulations
of both HD 209 458b and HD 189 733b. The stellar radia-
tive forcing coupled to the slow planetary rotation, drives
equatorial Rossby and Kelvin waves that act to pump an-
gular momentum to the equator creating and maintaining
super-rotation at the equator and retrograde jets at mid-
latitude (Showman & Polvani 2011; Tsai et al. 2014). These
jets, which can reach speeds of Mach 1.5, advect signiﬁcant
energy throughout the atmosphere. Though the horizon-
tal velocities are not directly considered in this paper, the
pressure-temperature proﬁles that we use are signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the jet structure.

For both our target planets the general ﬂow regime in-
cludes a prograde equatorial jet ﬂanked by a retrograde high
latitude ﬂow, for the low pressure strongly radiatively forced
atmosphere. The outer or low pressure atmosphere also ex-
hibits strong day night contrasts (and in HD 189 733b’s case
a thermal inversion discussed later), which decreases as we
move deeper into the higher pressure regions.

2 We remark that the coordinate system used in meteorology
refers to λ as the longitude and φ as latitude.

4 THE LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC

STRUCTURES OF HD 189 733B AND
HD 209 458B

The local thermodynamic structure (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) de-
termines the cloud formation because the cloud formation
processes (nucleation, growth/evaporation) depend on local
properties only.

The 3D atmosphere simulations utilised here suggest for
both planets, HD 189 733b (left) and HD 209 458b (right) in
Fig. 1, a distinct day-night diﬀerence of ≈ 500K in the upper
atmosphere. The local gas temperature, Tgas, is independent
on longitude, φ, in the inner (deeper), high-pressure part of
the atmosphere for pgas > 5bar in both giant gas planets.
The velocity, however, changes dependent on longitude as
the vertical mixing parameter, Kzz, demonstrate in Fig. 2.
The HD 209 458b (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) structures are generally
smoother than in HD 189 733b across all latitudes (φ).

The local, height-dependent thermodynamic struc-
tures of HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b (Fig. 1) diﬀer sub-
stantially for diﬀerent longitudes as both planets diﬀer
in mass (MHD189b > MHD209b) and radii (RHD189b <
RHD209b), hence both planets have diﬀerent bulk densi-
ties, ρbulk,HD189b (cid:29) ρbulk,HD209b, and for the atmospheric
scale height, H, follows that Hbulk,HD189b < Hbulk,HD209b.
HD 209 458b orbits its host star at a somewhat larger
distance than HD 189 733b. The result is that the local
(Tgas(z), pgas(z))-proﬁles along the equator diﬀer consid-
erably between the two planets, as does the local vertical
mixing. These diﬀerences will aﬀect the cloud structure of
the planets. The (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) structures span diﬀerent
ranges in gas pressure with HD 189 733b reaching deeper into
the high-pressure regime than HD 209 458b. The extension of
HD 209 458b into lower pressures compared to HD 189 733b
is a result of the choice of the outer boundary conditions for
both simulations.

Temperature inversion inside atmospheres are generally
interesting features as they can develop a feedback with the
local velocity structure. Temperature inversions (or pressure
inversion) can occur as a result of the hydrodynamic evolu-
tion like for the present simulation of HD 189 733b or as
result of an increase in local opacity (e.g. due to C2 and C3
Helling et al. 2000 or TiO/VO Fortney et al. 2008). Unlike
for C2 and C3 in the case of AGB stars, TiO and VO had
to be artiﬁcially injected at appropriate atmospheric heights
as both molecules would not be present in the gas phase in
the upper atmosphere (compare Fig. 11). In the present 3D
atmosphere simulation for HD 189 733b, a temperature in-
version develops without the need of an an additional opac-
ity source. The HD 209 458b atmosphere simulation does
not suggest such a pronounced temperature inversion inside
the atmosphere. If an opacity source is artiﬁcially added in
form of TiO/VO, also the HD 209 458b models develops a
temperature inversion (Showman et al. 2009b) at ∼ 10−3
bar on the day side. However, also the add-on-free-TiO/VO
HD 209 458b model suggest a small temperature inversion
at longitude φ = 30o and latitude θ = 0o at pgas ≈ 0.1bar.
A tendency of an outward temperature increase occurs for
φ = 300o and φ = 330o at θ = 0o. Comparing system param-
eters for the two planets (Table 1) shows that HD 209 458b
orbits its host star at a larger distance than HD 189 733b,
hence HD 209 458b receives less irradiation.

There are two eﬀects working together to create the
temperature inversions seen in some of the proﬁles for
HD 189 733b: stellar heating at low pressures and advective
cooling at higher pressures. The peak in the temperature
proﬁles at pgas ≈ 5 · 10−2 bars is associated with the peak
in the net stellar-energy deposition. In the absence of dy-
namics, the radiation would diﬀuse inward until the region
at higher pressures became roughly isothermal (e.g. Guillot
2010). However, including dynamics results in a return ﬂow
of gas from the night side that is cooler then the overlying
gas. The radiative timescale increases with depth, becoming
comparable to the advective timescale at approximately 0.5
bars. The radiative heating of the newly arriving cooler gas
is insuﬃcient to create an isothermal region that extends
throughout the region. Balancing the radiative heating and
advective cooling yields the decrease in temperature in the
region around 0.5 bars.

4.1 Day/night temperature diﬀerence

The day/night side temperature diﬀerence, ∆Tday/night, are
largest in the upper, low pressure part for both giant gas
planets due to the eﬀect of stellar irradiation. ∆Tday/night →
0 in the high-pressure atmospheres for pgas > 1bar for both
giant gas planets.

for
HD 209 458b is nearly similar for all longitudes in the atmo-
sphere model applied here. Comparing φ = 0o vs φ = 180o
at the equator (θ = 0) results in ∆Tday/night ≈ 500K
low pressure part of the
for HD 209 458b in the upper,
atmosphere model. This is, within error bars, the value
that was suggested by Zellem et al. (2014) base on 4.5µm
Spitzer/IRAC data for HD 209 458b. The day/night side
temperature diﬀerence is larger for HD 189 733b in the
middle-atmosphere resulting in ∆Tday/night ≈ 700K at the
maximum of the temperature inversion at pgas = 10−2bar.
The day/night temperature diﬀerence at the equator has
decreased to ∆Tday/night ≈ 500K for φ = 0o vs φ = 180o
similar to HD 209 458b.

4.2 Vertical mixing

The local vertical velocity is used to determine the vertical
mixing, Kzz, required for the cloud formation module. This
approach is similar to the diﬀusion approach advocated by
Ackerman & Marley (2001) who specify mixing by a con-
stant diﬀusion coeﬃcient, Kzz = H 2/τmix. Charnay et al.
(2015) show that the 1D diﬀusive ansatz is likely to overes-
timate the vertical mixing resulting in an overestimation of
particle abundance and particle size at high altitudes. Char-
nay et al. (2015) provide a gas pressure dependent param-
eterisation for Kzz comparable to Parmentier et al. (2013).
Lee et al. (2015a) (their Fig. 3) suggest that such parame-
terisations are very approximate. Here we use the vertical
velocity component from the 3D simulations for both plan-
ets directly. A test has shown that the use of the Parmentier
et al. (2013) values mainly expands the cloud height towards
lower pressures. We, however, note that the need for a ver-
tical mixing representation results for every 1D approach,
hence also for ours that we presently apply to provide a ﬁrst
insight into kinetically calculated cloud properties of giant

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

gas planets like HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b. This mix-
ing approximation will become obsolete in fully coupled 3D
radiative-hydrodynamic models with cloud formation feed-
back.

Figure 2 shows that the vertical mixing is stronger in
the inner (deeper) atmospheric regions in HD 189 733b com-
pared to HD 209 458b. This is were element enhancement
through cloud particle evaporation will occur. The termina-
tor regions and the substellar points show diﬀerent mixing
eﬃciencies between the two planets despite relatively com-
parable (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) structures. The vertical mixing
at the substellar point is stronger on HD 189 733b than on
HD 209 458b in the upper atmospheric parts.

Figure 2 further suggests that the global vertical mix-
ing for diﬀerent longitudes across the planet is homoge-
neously more vigorous in the atmosphere of HD 209 458b
(right) which is stronger irradiated by its hotter host star
than HD 189 733b (left). This is diﬀerent to the day/night
side diﬀerences in mixing of HD 189 733b. Consequently, the
optically thin atmospheric layers will always be more vigor-
ously mixed in HD 209 458b compared to HD 189 733b indi-
cating a stronger variability in potential spectral features.
The less irradiated HD 189 733b show a stronger day/night
side variation in mixing activity with the night side showing
considerably less eﬃcient mixing than HD 209 458b.

5 THE DUST CLOUD STRUCTURES OF

HD 189 733B AND HD 209 458B

HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b are the two most observed
extrasolar planets (see Sect. 1). Observations were analyzed
by applying retrieval methods based on mainly two codes,
Nemesis (Barstow et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014) and Scar-
let (Benneke 2015), which both assume eﬀective particle
sizes, homogeneous material composition and the number
of cloud particles. The present paper provides more insight
into the cloud properties of HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b
by analyzing the cloud formation processes based on 3D at-
mosphere simulations. We demonstrate that the clouds on
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b are far richer then suggested
by present observation due to their necessarily hemispheri-
cally averaged nature.

5.1 The local view

The local cloud properties are determined by the rate at
which seed particles can form from the gas-phase (2nd pan-
els Figs. 3, 4; and Fig. A1) and the eﬃciency with which
they can grow (Figs. A2). Both are determined by the lo-
cal gas temperature, the local gas density (or gas pressure,
1st panels Figs. 3, 4) and also by the local chemical compo-
sition. We discuss how the cloud structures diﬀer between
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b in the following section, the
gas-phase composition is discussed in Sect. 6.2. We note that
the local quantities may change to some extent if the un-
derlying model atmosphere simulation undergoes updates
due to ongoing development work on, for example, opaci-
ties which might aﬀect the deeper atmosphere structure. For
the local view, we chose three diﬀerent trajectories for each
planet representing the substellar points (θ = 0◦, φ = 0◦)
and the two terminators (θ = 0◦, φ = 90◦ and φ = 270◦).

material volume fraction VS/Vtot for HD 209 458b; 5th panel: material volume fraction VS/Vtot for HD 189 733b. The colour coding for
the 3rd and 4th panel is: TiO2[s] - solid very dark blue, Al2O3[s] - solid blue, CaTiO2[s] - solid purple, FeS[s] - dotted green, FeO[s] -
dashed green, Fe[s] - solid green, SiO[s] - dashed brown, SiO2[s] - solid brown, MgO[s] - dashed dirty orange, MgSiO3 - dashed orange,
Mg2SiO4 - solid orange.

HD 209 458b clouds form from one single nucleation re-
gion that spans several orders of magnitude in gas pressure
(see also Fig. A1). HD 189 733b clouds are characterised by
two nucleation peaks at low and at high gas pressure near
the substellar point where the temperature inversion causes
a local increase of gas temperature, and therewith nucleation
ceases until the temperature has dropped low enough again.

The consequence is a smoother distribution of (mean) grain
sizes throughout the cloud in HD 209 458b locally and glob-
ally (3rd panels Figs. 3, 4; and Fig. A3). HD 189 733b clouds
do have a middle-region of big grains with (cid:104)a(cid:105)HD 209 458b ≈
1µm (cid:104)a(cid:105)HD 189 733b ≈ 103µm at pgas ≈ 10−2bar. The material
composition of the cloud particles are considerably diﬀerent
between the two planets at these pressures at the substellar

planets HD 189 733b (red) and HD 209 458b (blue). The panels and line styles have the same meaning like in Fig. 3. The colour coding
for the 3rd and 4th panel is: TiO2[s] - solid very dark blue, Al2O3[s] - solid blue, CaTiO2[s] - solid purple, FeS[s] - dotted green, FeO[s]

the HD 189 733b cloud structure. Similar values of gravita-
tional settling are only reached in the lower (inner) cloud in
HD 209 458b (Fig. 5).

that

Figures 3, 4 (3rd panel) demonstrate

the
mean grain sizes diﬀer largely between HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b at the substellar point, but they are rather
similar at the terminators despite a gas temperature dif-
ference of ≈ 500K at the upper model boundary. A closer
inspection, however, reveals that for (θ = 0◦, φ = 90◦)
the cloud material composition diﬀers. Both planets show
MgSiO3[s] contributing with 20-25% to the cloud material
upto pgas ≈ 10−2bar. The next most important material
is Mg2SiO4[s] (18%) in HD 189 733b but SiO[s] (20%) in
HD 209 458b. HD 209 458b has a larger fraction of Fe[s] con-
tributing to the cloud composition in these upper regions,
while HD 189 733b oﬀers a mix of SiO[s], SiO2[s], MgO[s],
FeO[s] contributing with each ≈ 10% but Fe[s]<1%.

We note that HD209 458b has a large pressure scale
height at (θ = 0◦, φ = 270◦) spreading the upper cloud into
regions of lower densities compared to HD 189 733b. If only
the terminators were used to compare the atmospheric struc-
ture of HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b, one would conclude
that they should be similar as also the (Tgas(z), pgas(z))
are rather similar and so is the material composition of the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

cloud particles. A more global view, however, suggests that
the mean grain sizes are mostly larger in HD 209 458b at any
given pressure level (Fig. A3) unless aﬀected by a tempera-
ture inversion. This is a result of the lower nucleation rate
(Fig. A1) which causes fewer seed particles to form, hence
the cloud particles can grow bigger than in a case of more
eﬃcient nucleation as in HD 189 733b. The biggest cloud par-
ticles reside at the lower cloud edge in both models. However
note, that none of the models reaches high enough gas tem-
peratures for the cloud particle to evaporate completely at
such high gas pressures.

5.1.1 Dust loading of atmosphere: ρdust/ρgas and (cid:104)vdr(cid:105)
The dynamics of an atmosphere are also determined by the
feedback of the clouds through dynamical processes like fric-
tion. The force equilibrium between (eﬀective) gravity and
friction determines how fast a cloud particle can fall and,
hence, to what geometrical extension (or height) the cloud
can grow. The drift velocity determines how fast a particular
part of the atmosphere is emptied or ﬁlled with cloud mate-
rial from other regions. Figure. 5 shows how the drift veloc-
ity (or gravitational settling velocity) changes with height

Figure 5. Drift velocity for trajectories on the equator (HD 189 733b - left, HD 209 458b - right). Large drift velocities in the mid-cloud
region relates to large mean grain sizes (see Fig. A3). Small drift velocities near the cloud base are caused by increasing friction due to
the increasing local gas density.

gas planets.

less aﬀected by changes of the underlying 3D atmosphere
simulation in the present two-model approach.

Figure 6 show the dust-to-gas ratio, ρdust/ρgas, which
can be understood as dust load of the atmosphere. The com-
parison of both ﬁgures shows that the lowest dust loading of
the atmospheric gas occurs where the drift velocity is high-
est. ρdust/ρgas decreases at the cloud bottom because the
cloud particles evaporate.

5.2 The global view

The thermodynamic properties of the atmospheres of the
giant gas planets HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b diﬀer con-
siderably due to the diﬀerent global parameters of the plan-
ets like radii, bulk density and equilibrium temperature.
Therefore, we now discus how the global cloud structures
change which impact the global opacity pattern and with
that observational global quantities like albedo and equilib-
rium temperatures. We expect the global cloud results to be

Figures 7 and 8 provide a quasi-three-dimensional view
on the cloud material composition, Vs/Vtot, and the mean
size of the cloud particles, (cid:104)a(cid:105), for two diﬀerent longitudes
(θ = 45◦, θ = 0◦ (equator)), various longitudes at day
(Fig. 7) and at night (Fig 8) side versus the local gas pres-
sure.

Figures 7 and 8 oﬀer a 3D impression of how the cloud
material composition and the mean grain sizes change for
the atmospheric trajectories probed in HD 189 733b (top)
and HD 209 458b (bottom). The cloud material composi-
tion changes with height irrespective of
lati-
tude and planet considered. The clouds resulting for the
3D thermodynamic structures used here are predominantly
made of a mix of MgSiO3[s] and Mg2SiO4[s] (>30%), and
Fe2O3[s]/Fe[s]/MgO[s] and SiO2[s] in the upper atmospheric
regions where the particles are small (10−4 . . . 10−2µm). De-
pending on the local conditions in the upper atmosphere,
SiO2[s] (≈ 20%) can become the second most abundant ma-
terial in these cloud particles after MgSiO3[s]. This occurs at

longitude,

Al2O3[s], and a less than 1% CaTiO3[s] and TiO2[s] con-
tribute to the material composition throughout the whole
cloud. Slightly more CaTiO3[s] is present in HD 189 733b

5.2.1 Day-night-side diﬀerence

For both planets, the day side (Fig. 7) shows a stronger
inward-increase of the cloud particles sizes than the night
side. The particles grow more eﬃciently in HD 189 733b
than in HD 209 458b because HD 189 733b has a more com-

6 THE IMPACT OF DUST CLOUD

FORMATION ON GAS-PHASE CHEMISTRY
IN HD 189 733B AND HD 209 458B

The composition of the atmospheric gas in chemical equi-
librium is determined by the local gas temperature and gas
pressure (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) and by the element abundances.
All element abundances that are involved in cloud formation
will deviate from an initial (e.g. solar) value by how much is
locked up in the cloud particles or by how much is released
back into the gas phase. This is of particular interest if the
cloud particle formation took place at a diﬀerent location
compared (e.g. cloud top) to where it evaporates (e.g. cloud
bottom).

6.1 Atmospheric element abundances

Element abundances are an important set of input quan-
tities for every chemical model, and hence, for every ra-
diative transfer atmosphere simulation. It is therefore a
long-standing challenge to determine atmospheric element
abundances to a high precision for stellar atmospheres (e.g.
Grevesse et al. 2007; Amarsi et al. 2015). Element abun-
dances for planetary atmospheres are even harder to deter-
mine and the host star’s set of element abundances is usu-
ally applied assuming that planets form from gravitation-
ally unstable protoplanetary disks keeping the host star’s
element abundances. This belief has recently been chal-
lenged by chemical disk evolution models (Helling et al.
2014). Another challenge for observing the element abun-
dances from planetary atmospheres arises from the fact that
the formation of clouds causes a selective depletion of ele-
ments depending on the atmopshere’s local gas temperature
and gas pressure. It results in a height-dependent element
abundance pattern that changes across the planet’s globe
as we demonstrate here for two extrasolar planets. The is-
sue of element abundance determination is also highly rel-
evant for retrieval methods and the discussion of the C/O
ratio. While no one C/O ratio will exist for a cloud form-
ing atmosphere (Sect. 6.2.3), to search for one (planetary)
value for the metallicity is simply asking the wrong ques-
tion. Both, the C/O ratio and the metallicity depend on the
cloud formation eﬃciency and can therefore not be treated
as independent from any of the cloud parameters invoked in
retrieval methods. We demonstrate how the element abun-
dances change due to cloud formation in the two giant gas
planets HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b, and how the abun-
dance pattern may diﬀer between these two planets.

Figure 9 summarizes the element abundances for the
8 cloud forming elements (O, Ca, S, Al, Fe, Si, Mg)
forming 12 solid species (MgSiO3[s], Mg2SiO4[s], SiO[s],
SiO2[s], MgO[s], Fe[s], FeO[s], Fe2O3[s], Al2O3[s], TiO2[s],
CaTiO3[s], FeS[s]) for various test trajectories across the
equator (θ = 0◦) of HD 189 733b (left) and HD 209 458b
(right). The element abundances follow the same depletion
hierarchy in both planets: Ti is the most depleted, followed

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

by Al, then Fe, Si and Mg by about the same order of mag-
nitudes. The least overall depleted elements are O, Ca and
S. Individual trajectories that probe the atmosphere diﬀer
widely in their depletion pattern. The most prominent exam-
ple is the substellar point where in the case of HD 189 733b
all Si, Mg and Fe is returned to the gas phase through
the evaporation of the Si/Mg-binding materials (MgSiO3[s],
Mg2SiO4[s], SiO[s], SiO2[s], Fe[s], FeO[s], Fe2O3[s]) as re-
sult of the temperature inversion. A similar trend occurs in
HD 209 458b only at the cloud base.

The element depletion at the cloud top is somewhat
model dependent as the location of the cloud top (e.g. where
element depletion starts) depends on the setting of the up-
per model boundary. The location of the cloud base can in
principle be deﬁned as where all cloud particles have evap-
orated and the bound elements have been returned to the
gas phase. But this is only possible if the models extend to
high enough gas temperatures that the cloud particles can
evaporate completely. Both, HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b,
reach such high local gas pressures in the lower atmosphere
that the thermal stability of all materials considered here is
extended to substantially higher temperatures compared to,
for example, brown dwarfs. This is demonstrated in Fig. 10
for Fe[s]. However, some of the elements show an element
enrichment that results from cloud particles being formed
elsewhere and having rained into these regions where some
of their solids become thermally unstable. This is the case
for HD 189 733b on the day and the night side (compare
top of Figs. 7, 8) where all the Mg/Si/O minerals have
evaporated except MgO[s]. As MgSiO3[s], Mg2SiO4[s] and
SiO[s]/Fe2O3[s] make up >60% of the cloud particle vol-
ume, its evaporation produces a substantial enrichment at
the cloud base in oxygen, and to a lesser extent in Si and Mg
in HD 189 733b. Inspecting Fig. 9 shows that HD 209 458b
receives an even stronger oxygen enrichment at the cloud
base which, however, results mainly from MgSiO3[s] and
SiO2[s] evaporation (compare bottom of Figs. 7, 8). The
changing element abundance of Ca does not aﬀect the cloud
material volume remarkably.

6.2 Abundances of atoms, molecules and electrons

We consider the collisional dominated inner (deeper) part
of an atmosphere where kinetic gas-phase modelling is not
required, but which composes the inner boundary for kinetic
gas-phase rate networks (e.g. Ag´undez et al. 2012; Rimmer
& Helling 2015). We consider the part of the atmosphere
where the formation of dust clouds inﬂuences the local gas-
phase chemistry. The cloud formation causes a depletion of
those elements which take part in the condensation process
(e.g. Fe, Mg, O, Ti; Fig. 9) resulting in reduced abundances
of respective molecules. We neglect any external radiation
ﬁeld eﬀect on the gas phase chemistry. We are interested in
• by how much the gas-phase composition changes due to
the element depletion by cloud formation and how this ef-
fect might diﬀer between the two planets, HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b (Figs.11)
• TiO abundance in a cloud forming atmosphere (Figs.11)
• how the C/O-ratio changes across the globe and between
the two planets (Figs.13)

6.2.1 Chemical gas-phase abundance as a result of

element depletion by cloud formation

The ﬁrst observation from our results is that n(CO)(cid:29)
n(CH4) at the substellar point and at both terminators in
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b in the case of oxygen deple-
tion by cloud formation (Fig 11). CH4 approach CO in abun-
dance in our test case if no oxygen-depletion occurs (see
Fig. A4, A5). CO has been suggested to exist in the up-
per atmosphere of HD 189 733b (D´esert et al. 2009; de Kok

et al. 2013; Rodler et al. 2013), and Knutson et al. (2012)
suggest that more CO is required than suggested by chemi-
cal equilibrium calculation. More CO is required in order to
suppress the Spitzer 4.5µm ﬂux to the observed level with
the models applied in Knutson et al. (2012).

Figure 11 demonstrates how the molecular abundances
change as a result of element depletion. All molecules con-
taining Fe/Al/Mg/Si/O or a combination of those follow el-
ement depletion pattern. Molecules like NH3 and N2 are not
visibly aﬀected by cloud formation because N is not part of
any condensing species considered here. CaH and CaCl are
also not aﬀected by the cloud formation despite Ca being
part of CaTiO3 as condensing species.

Figure 11 further demonstrates that the abundance of
individual molecules is reduced by many orders of magni-
tudes which change throughout the atmosphere. It is further

dominated, inner (deeper) atmosphere. Shown are the number densities of atoms and molecules linked to the elements (O, Al, S, Mg, Ti
Fe, Si Ca) involved in cloud formation.

important to note that this eﬀect occurs also for CH4 and
CS which are molecules that are not aﬀected by depletion
of one of their constituent elements. Instead, they are in-
ﬂuenced by element depletion through other molecules like
CO2 for CH4 and AlS, FeS, MgS for CS.

Comparing the abundances of molecules of major inter-
est for observations, CO, H2O and CH4, for HD 189 733b
and HD 209 459b shows that the abundance of CO and
H2O are very similar in both atmospheres at the substel-
lar point (Fig. 11) in a gas that is aﬀected by element
depletion due to cloud formation. HS diﬀers by one or-
der of magnitude between the two planets. Figure A4 and
A5 (left columns) demonstrate that diﬀerences increase at
the terminator points which will aﬀect transit spectroscopy.
H2O remains the most abundant of these molecules and
of similar abundance in both atmospheres, but CO and
CH4 strongly decrease in the upper-most layers at the east
terminator (φ = 90o) in HD 209 459b. The diﬀerences in
the local (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) structures between the termina-
tor and substellar trajectories are imprinted into the local
molecular abundances: all trajectories show distinct chemi-
cal diﬀerences in both planets. We refer for more details to
Figs. 11, A4 and A5. Cloud free models will overestimate
diﬀerences in molecular abundances between both planets
(compare right columns of Figs. A4 and A5).

Given the interest in additional opacity species to pos-
sibly account for temperature inversions in atmospheres of
irradiated planets, we discuss our ﬁndings about the TiO
abundance. First, Ti is one of the most depleted elements
in an oxygen rich atmosphere where cloud formation takes

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

place. This is a result rather independent of the cloud mod-
elling approach simply because of the low solar abundance
value for Ti. TiO is depleted by 5-6 orders of magnitudes in
both planets inside the cloud region. Only TiH, AlH, AlS,
and Al2O appear more depleted than TiO. Considering now
that the upper boundaries of our present simulations for
HD 189 733b (left) and HD 209 458b are artiﬁcially ﬁxed, it
is reasonable to expect that the cloud expands to lower pres-
sures and with that the TiO depletion would continue to
higher atmospheric layers.

Figure 11 suggest that a temperature inversion might
be detectable by atomic emission lines as Fe and Mg appear
very abundant and even enhanced to a small extent. Tem-
perature inversions are related to a local positive tempera-
ture gradient at the high-pressure part of it. Molecules like
TiO and CO seem not too well suited to search for a tem-
perature inversion because TiO has a very low abundance
in the cloud region and CO is simply not aﬀected by the
temperature inversion, at least according to our equilibrium
chemistry calculation inside the irradiation-shielded and col-
lisional dominated atmosphere. However, strong molecular
lines may be used to derive local temperatures, for example
from high-resolution spectra as in Schwarz et al. (2015).

6.2.2 Water abundance

HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b do not cross the line of thermal

abundant gas-phase absorber in ultra-cool atmospheres,
and Fig. 12 shows where the molecule is most abundant
compared to the cloud location. The detection of atmo-
spheric molecular water in HD 189 733b has been reported
by Todorov et al. (2014); Crouzet et al. (2014) near 6µm
from secondary eclipse emission spectrum and McCullough
et al. (2014) report the detection of water in the transit
absorption spectrum of HD 189 733b. Evans et al. (2015)
initial results from Spitzer observations suggest no water
detection for HD 209 458b but the spectrum would suggest
the detection of haze and depleted CO. However, Deming
et al. (2013) provide evidence for molecular water at shorter
wavelengths, 1.4µm, from Hubble observations, which re-
cently was conﬁrmed by Sing et al. (2016). While molecular
water is omnipresent in both atmospheres, in HD 189 733b
and HD 209 459b, modelled here, we have an indication for
a drop in CO abundance at the east terminator (φ = 90o).
This result, however, would need to be conﬁrmed by kinetic
gas-phase calculations to test the eﬀect of the stellar ra-
diation ﬁeld. Returning to Fig. 12 suggests that a consid-
erably larger portion of the atmosphere of HD 209 458b is
aﬀected by the dust cloud. The lower mass of HD 209 458b
leads to a smaller surface gravity which leads to a larger
atmospheric scale height resulting in a larger geometrical
extension of the clouds. Our results concerning the pres-
ence and location of gaseous water in relation to the clouds
may explain some of the observed diﬀerences between the
two planets. In HD 189 733b, strong molecular water features
have been reported while HD 209 458b H2O-absorption ap-
pears much shallower. However, by considering the location
of the clouds in the two atmospheres, we see that obscur-
ing clouds exist high in the atmosphere of HD 209 458b, but
much deeper in HD 189 733b. Cloud opacity calculations sug-
gest that gaseous water could be observable on both planets,

location of the cloud top (in terms of nd) for HD 189 733b (top)

on HD 189 733b and on HD 209 458b (Fig. A9, A8, A9) as
the cloud extinction is low at wavelength related to Spitzer
bands. A closer inspection of the 3.6µm, 4.5µm, and 5.8µm
opacity in Figs. 16 and 17 as indicative of the IRAC 1,2
and 3 bands, shows that the opacity peaks at ≈0.1 bars.

6.2.3 Changing carbon-to-oxygen ratio

The carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O= log C/ log O, C - car-
bon element abundance, O - oxygen element abundance)
is often used as indicator for potential carbon-binding
molecules and it has recently attracted attention in the exo-
planetary community with respect to the study of pre-biotic
carbohydrate molecules. The C/O ratio has been used a
global parameter (similar to log(g) or Teﬀ ) to argue for

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

The mineral clouds on HD 209 458b and HD 189 733b

17

of this paper in Fig. 13. Figure 13 shows that the C/O ratio
changes with height throughout the cloud. It ﬁrst increases
due to the massive depletion of oxygen from an initial value
of C/O=0.427 to C/O=0.495 for both planets near the top
of the cloud. Depending on longitude, it remains at the this
maximum level or starts to drop due to oxygen being re-
leased to the gas through silicate evaporation. In the case
of HD 189 733b, the oxygen abundance is enriched to values
larger than the initial solar value which is a clear sign for
cloud particles moving through the atmosphere and, hence,
transporting elements into diﬀerent regions. This is partic-
ularly prominent at the cloud base of HD 189 733b where
C/O has decreased to almost 0.35. Note that these changes
are solely caused by changes in the O as C = solar
in the
present models. Such a changing C/O ratio has implications
for synthetic spectrum calculation, for example for young ob-
jects where the accreted dust from the protoplanetary disk
serves as condensation seed and clears out the atmosphere
until the supersaturation (S = pX/psat,X, X any key species
of a condensing material) drops below one for the key species
of a condensing material, i.e. until S = 1. Our investigations
show again that it remains an illusion to attribute one C/O
ratio value or one metallicity value to a planet that forms
clouds inside its atmosphere. With that we conﬁrm our pre-
vious ﬁndings in (Bilger et al. 2013; Helling et al. 2014).

C

6.3 The abundances of hydrocarbon and

cyanopolyyne molecules

Hydrocarbon and cyanopolyyne molecules are of growing
interest for extrasolar planets due to their potential link to
biomolecules (e.g. Rimmer & Helling 2015 and references
therein). The oxygen depletion caused by the formation of
clouds has a strong impact on the abundance of the dom-
inant molecules as re-iterated in Sect. 6.2. We are now in
the position to investigate what aﬀect this would have on
the abundance of carbohydrate molecules including large
N-bearing species HCxN, complex hydrocarbons CnH2n±2,
C2H2n, CH-bearing radical CxH, CHx and Cx. Bilger et al.
(2013) have demonstrated that cloud formation leads to a
increase in the C/O ratio such that several hydrocarbon
molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules can be present in
brown dwarf and giant gas planet atmospheres. A large sur-
face gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity lead to an in-
creased abundance of these species. Bilger et al. (2013) show
that CO, CO2, CH4 and HCN contain the largest fraction
of carbon.

Figures 14 and A7 show the abundance of hydrocarbon
molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules in HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b, respectively. We note that these abundances
are for the collisionally dominated part of the atmosphere
only, where the assumption of chemical equilibrium is valid.
The most abundant hydrocarbon molecule is CH4 in
both planets, followed by HCN, OH and CH3 with chang-
ing importance depending on the local thermodynamic con-
ditions. These molecules reach abundances comparable to
MgH, MgS, CaH or Fe at pgas >1bar (Fig. 11). The larger
hydrocarbon and cyanopolyyne molecules abundance de-
crease strongly towards the upper atmosphere but are rather
substantial in the high-density part of the atmosphere where
pgas >1bar. Large molecules like C2H6 and C2H3 followed by
CH3CN are the most abundant molecules after CH4, HCN,

(φ = 90o - cyan, φ = 270o - brown). The initial, solar value is

the existence of carbon planets where C/O>1 (Madhusud-
han 2012). Helling et al. (2014) demonstrated that a con-
siderable overabundance of carbon over oxygen is very un-
likely to occur during disk evolution, and that cloud forma-
tion is one mechanism to tip an atmosphere into a carbon-
rich regime if C/O is already close to one. Benneke (2015)
concludes from his analysis that HD209458b, WASP-12b,
WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b, and XO-1b but also WASP-17b,
WASP-43b and HD 189 733b have atmospheres with a global
C/O<0.9, hence these atmosphere appear oxygen-rich. We
summarize our ﬁndings about the C/O ratio for HD 189 733b
and HD 209 458b based on the combined modelling approach

hydrocarbon molecule (C2H6) changes considerably in par-
ticular in the low-density part of the atmosphere of both
planets (Fig. A7, A7). The C2H3 abundances, in contrast,
do not change very much with longitude.

in
the inner, dense part of the atmospheres of HD 189 733b
and HD 209 458b but non-equilibrium processes will need
to be studied to see if these molecules could reach an
observational abundance also in the upper part of the
atmosphere. It is, however,
likely that these molecules
would be hidden beneath cloud layers as the comparison
with the cloud particle number density in Figures 14 and
A7 suggests.

These ﬁndings are also of interest for future kinetic gas
phase studies that take into account the inﬂuence of high-
energy radiation like for example cosmic rays or the host
star’s radiation ﬁeld.

7 DIFFERENT CLOUD OPACITY FOR

DIFFERENT PLANETS

The cloud extinction is relevant for understanding observa-
tions of hot spots or molecular abundances as discussed in
Sect. 6.2.2 for water. Many authors very approximatively de-
scribe the chemically complex clouds on extrasolar planets
like HD 189 733b and HD 209 459b. We therefore present the
cloud extinctions for HD 189 733b and HD 209 459b for their
day-side and the night-side in conjunction with the (cid:104)a(z)(cid:105)
(height-dependent mean cloud particle size). The material
composition that relates to an (cid:104)a(z)(cid:105) for the atmospheric
trajectories considered here can be retrieved from Figs. 7
and 8. We demonstrate how the cloud opacities diﬀer be-
tween the two planets in the following section.

7.1 Cloud extinction from cloud formation

Figures 16 shows
the day-side cloud extinction, κext
[cm2g−1], and Fig. 17 the night-side cloud extinction as sum
of the cloud absorption and scattering. Figures A8 (substel-
lar point) and A9 (terminator) provide more details of the
individual contributions of scattering and absorption of the
cloud layers.

Generally, the cloud opacity is individual to each of the
two planets. In both planets, however, the cloud opacity is
largest in the upper cloud layers which are dominated by
particles of (cid:104)a(cid:105) (cid:54) 0.1µm. Both clouds are darkest if observed
at 0.3µm and appear successively lighter if observed at
longer wavelengths as the extinction decreases with increas-
ing wavelengths. The extinction drops rapidly at a certain
pressure level in both planets and this is associated with the
strong rise in particles sizes. Once the mean particles sizes
(panel 3 in Figs. 3, 4) has reached a maximum value, the
cloud extinction drops to its minimum. HD 209 458b shows
generally a smother change in cloud particle size (Fig. A3,
bottom) as result of the formation of seed particles occur-
ring rather homogeneously along those trajectories studied

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

here. Our results for HD 189 733b demonstrates that a tem-
perature inversion in the atmosphere has a distinct eﬀect on
the cloud properties that will also aﬀect the cloud extinc-
tion: Seed formation occurs intermittently along a certain
trajectory and in comparison between diﬀerent trajectories
(Fig. A1, φ = 0o, 45o, 315o). As consequence, the mean grain
size changes vividly along such a trajectory, hence the cloud
particle sizes change strongly with atmospheric height, but
also with longitude as Fig. A3 (top) demonstrates. Follow-
ing now the cloud extinction at φ = 0o, 45o and φ = 315o in
HD 189 733b in Fig. 16 shows, that the cloud opacity shows
the most unpredictable changes as function of wavelength
and also with atmospheric height at these longitudes. To
put these results in perspective, most of the transit spec-
troscopy observations are ﬁtted with one particle size for
the whole cloud, retrieval methods assume 2-4 particle sizes
(e.g. de Kok et al. 2011; Barstow et al. 2014; Lee et al.
2014). However, it is interesting to note that both plan-
ets have similar cloud opacity at the 90o-terminator despite
HD 209 458b having lower gas pressure at the cloud top. The
diﬀerences between the two planets in cloud opacity at the
270o-terminator originates from a diﬀerence in number of
cloud particles at the cloud top as the r.h.s. of Fig. 4 indi-
cates, but not from a diﬀerence in particle sizes or materials.
While the material composition is important for the el-
ement depletion of the gas phase, it is less important for the
cloud extinction near the top of the atmosphere. Here, the
number of particles and the mean grain size have the largest
impact on the cloud extinction. It is therefore not surpris-
ing that observations for transitting planets can be ﬁt by
almost every material for which optical data are available
(e.g. Wakeford & Sing 2015; Nikolov et al. 2015). This also
means, that the cloud extinction is the result of the cloud
formation process as the mean grain size will be determined
by the rate at which condensation seeds can form and where.
We have discussed this above for the example of a temper-
ature inversion. In conclusion, we demonstrated that only
a detailed cloud model lifts the nd/(cid:104)a(cid:105)/ Vs/Vtot degeneracy
in retrieval methods. This degeneracy is artiﬁcially gener-
ated by assuming independence of cloud parameters which
is simply incorrect.

8 DISCUSSION

8.1 Cloud properties in perspective

The desire to extract meaningful information from observa-
tions (or to decide what a meaningful information is) led to
the development of retrieval methods which mainly solve the
radiative transfer problem for prescribed parameters. The
challenge is now to statistically evaluate and re-set these ini-
tial parameters such that a best ﬁt to a set of observational
information is achieved. Therefore, observations were ﬁtted
by a selected number of cloud size bins, a prescribed mate-
rial composition and number of cloud particles, prescribed
pressure levels for cloud deck and the cloud base and other
assumptions for the gas composition.

small particles < 0.3µm or 10 µm particles, but a degener-

a best ﬁt by a homodisperse cloud layer made of < 0.1µm-

does not aﬀect H2O.
Pont et al. (2013) imply that various cloud particle
sizes would be required to ﬁt to their transit spectra of
HD 189 733b.

Our results indeed show that the upper part of the cloud
on HD 189 733b is dominated by small cloud particles of
≈ 0.01 . . . 0.1µm and an abundance of nd ≈ 10−4 cm−3.

most abundant materials being ≈ 22 % MgSiO3[s], ≈ 20 %

replaced by the same amount of Fe[s], and ≈ 9 % MgO[s].
These detailed volume fractions are for the 90o terminator.
We have demonstrated that the relative abundance of the
materials does change across the globe and that MgSiO3[s]
is the dominating material at the cloud top with ≈ 20 %
volume fraction but with other silicates only marginally less
abundant.

HD 209 458b:
Not much seems known from observation about cloud prop-
erties on HD 209 458b, except the suggestion that the ob-
servation of Si2+ in the planet’s exosphere indicates that
no clouds involving Si should form (Koskinen et al. 2013).
Burrows et al. (2008) and Rowe et al. (2006) conclude that
there are no (high-altitude) reﬂecting clouds in HD 209 458b.
Hood et al. (2008) invoked iron and enstatite (MgSiO3[s])
assuming a homodisperse cloud particle size of 5µm for their
3D radiative transfer calculation on fractal clouds.
Our results show that the mean cloud particle size can be as
small as 0.01µm at the cloud top which might be accessible
by transit spectroscopy. These particles are made of a mix of
materials with again ≈ 21 % volume fraction by MgSiO3[s]
and ≈ 18 % Mg2SiO4[s] or SiO2[s] depending on latitude.
Limitations of these results arise from the conﬁnement
of our simulation to a limited computational domain. One
might therefore wonder if other elements like Na, K, Mn,
Cu, or Zn would change our results if the atmosphere would
extent to lower pressures. Element abundance determina-
tion is an ever evolving topic, but also the newest literature
conﬁrms that Fe(7.47), Mg (7.59), Si (7.51), are consider-
ably more abundant in the Sun than Na (6.21), Mn (5.42),
K(5.04), Zn (4.56), or Cu (4.18) (Scott et al. 2015b; Grevesse
et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2015a) but considerably less than
oxygen. Hence, if we use the Sun as a reference, all less
abundant elements can only contribute to the cloud particle
growth with a very small fraction. The growth of TiO2[s] is
such an example. While TiO2 is very important as nucle-
ation seed, it plays a very minor role for the cloud particle
sizes or the material composition. We are therefore conﬁdent
that the number of elements will not alter the cloud particle
sizes nor their material composition substantially.

9 CONCLUSION

The results of present global circulation models, coupled
with a non-equilibrium cloud formation model, suggest that
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b are covered with mineral
clouds throughout the entire modelling domain. Both giant
gas planets, HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b, have similarly
chemically complex mineral clouds. Their cloud particles are
a mix that is dominated by Si/Fe/Mg/Al-O silicates and ox-
ides, and the relative abundance of these materials changes
depending on the local thermodynamic properties. Indepen-
dent of longitude and latitude, a strong height-dependence
of the cloud particle material composition and their mean
size occur in both planets. The cloud material composition
in the upper and intermediate cloud layers is generally more
rich in HD 189 733b than in HD 209 458b meaning more ma-
terials contribute to each cloud particle. HD 209 458b gener-
ally has a small-grain cloud part region of several pressure

magnitudes (cloud top) with a sharp growth zone leading
to big mixed grains ((cid:104)a(cid:105) ≈ 103µm) with an iron content of
≈ 20% at the cloud base. The cloud particles in HD 189 733b
grow to a maximum size of (cid:104)a(cid:105) ≈ 102.2µm and are made of
90% Fe[s] and 10% TiO2[s] at the cloud base. If only the ter-
minators were used to compare the atmospheric structure of
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b, one would conclude that they
should be similar as their (Tgas(z), pgas(z)) structures are
rather similar at these points, and so is the material compo-
sition of the cloud particles. A more global view, however,
suggests a more diﬀerentiated picture.

The chemical diversity of the cloud particles is im-
printed into the remaining element abundances which is
also strongly height-dependent. Both, the C/O ratio and
the metallicity depend on the cloud formation eﬃciency and
can therefore not be treated as independent from any of the
cloud parameters as it is commonly assumed in retrieval
methods. It remains an illusion to attribute one C/O ratio
value to any particular cloud forming planet.

The individual cloud results for HD 189 733b and
HD 209 458b allow to understand the diﬀerence in the de-
tected molecular water on HD 209 458b: The H2O content
at 0.1 bars is higher on HD189 733b then in HD209 458b
Hydrocarbon and cyanopolyyne molecules can be rather
abundant in the inner, dense part of the atmospheres of
HD 189 733b and HD 209 458b but non-equilibrium processes
will need to be studied to see if these molecules could reach
an observational abundance also in the upper part of the
atmosphere. The presence of large hydrocarbon molecules is
not to be confused with the formation of hydrocarbon clus-
ters which then could be interpreted as hydrocarbon hazes.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that only a de-
tailed modelling of the cloud formation processes allows to
disentangle the cloud parameter degeneracy that is an arti-
ﬁcial result from retrieval methods by their assumption of
the independence of parameters.
