We investigate the action of local and global noise on monogamy of quantum correlations, when monogamy
scores are considered as observables, and three-qubit systems are subjected to global noise and various local
noisy channels, namely, amplitude-damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels. We show that the
dynamics of monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and quantum discord, in the case of generalized W
states, as inputs to the noisy channels, can exhibit non-monotonic dynamics with respect to increasing noise
parameter, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay of monogamy scores when generalized Greenberger-
Horne-Zeilinger states are exposed to noise. We quantify the persistence of monogamy against noise via a
characteristic value of the noise parameter, and show that depolarizing noise destroys monogamy of quantum
correlation faster compared to other noisy channels. We demonstrate that the negativity monogamy score is
more robust than the quantum discord monogamy score, when the noise is of the phase-damping type. We
also investigate the variation of monogamy with increasing noise for arbitrary three-qubit pure states as inputs.
Finally, depending on these results, we propose a two-step protocol, which can conclusively identify the type
of noise applied to the quantum system, by using generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and generalized W
states as resource states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

An important characterization of a composite quantum sys-
tem is by the correlations, both classical and quantum, be-
tween its constituting parts. Quantum information theory pro-
vides a collection of measures of quantum correlations [1–3],
which can broadly be categorized into two classes. One is the
“entanglement-separability” class, encompassing various mea-
sures of quantum entanglement in both bipartite and multipartite
domain [1]. The other is the information-theoretic regime [2, 3],
consisting of quantum correlations such as quantum discord [4],
and various “discord-like” measures [5, 6], that quantify quan-
tum correlations beyond entanglement. Both entanglement as
well as information theoretic quantum correlation measures have
been proposed to be resources for several quantum protocols
[7–18], and have been observed successfully in the laboratory
[19, 20]. However, quantum correlations, especially entangle-
ment, have been found to be fragile under decoherence [21].
Naturally, due to their immense importance in quantum infor-
mation processing tasks, investigating the behavior of quantum
correlations under various kinds of environmental noise has been
a topic of utmost importance in quantum information theory.

Most of the available literature that deals with decoherence
of quantum correlations consider bipartite quantum correla-
tion measures due to their relative computational simplicity
[22, 23, 25–30]. It has been shown that the bipartite entangle-
ment measures tend to decay rapidly with increasing noise, and
vanish when a threshold noise level is crossed. This phenomena
is known as “entanglement sudden death”, and has been studied
extensively in the case of bipartite systems under different types
of environments [22, 23]. In stark contrast to this behavior, infor-
mation theoretic measures, namely, quantum discord, quantum
work deﬁcit, and several geometric measures, have been found
to undergo an asymptotic decay with increasing noise strength
[24–27], indicating a higher robustness against noise than that
of entanglement. It has also been shown that special two- as
well as multiqubit mixed quantum states can be engineered for
which “discord-like” quantum correlations may remain frozen
over a ﬁnite range of noise strength [28, 29], while the entan-

glement measures for those states exhibit no such property (cf.
[30]). Although behavior of bipartite quantum correlations un-
der decoherence is a well-investigated topic, similar studies in
the multipartite scenario [31] are limited due to the lack of com-
putable measures of quantum correlations for mixed multipartite
states.

Recent developments on the monogamy relation of quantum
correlations [32–36] have provided an effective tool to investi-
gate the multipartite nature of quantumness present in a com-
posite quantum system. Qualitatively, monogamy of a quan-
tum correlation measure corresponding to a multipartite state
is the property that allows a chosen party to share only lim-
ited amount of quantum correlation with all the other parties
except one, to which it is highly quantum correlated.
Inter-
estingly, such monogamy constraints can be quantiﬁed via the
“monogamy score” [37], leading to multipartite quantum cor-
relation measures that use bipartite measures of quantum cor-
relations, thereby reducing the difﬁculty in the computation of
the measures for multipartite states. The monogamy property of
quantum correlations has been shown to be important in several
aspects in quantum mechanics and quantum information, like
foundations of quantum mechanics [38], quantum cryptography
[39], teleportation [40], quantum dense coding [41], quantum
steering [42], many-body physics [43], and black-hole informa-
tion theory [44]. Experimental investigation of this property has
also been initiated [45]. Therefore, it has become important to
investigate the behavior of the monogamy property of quantum
correlations when the system is subjected to noisy environments.
This paper has two different objectives that are complemen-
tary to each other. In one, we study the dynamics of monogamy
of quantum correlations. As measures of quantum correlations,
we use the monogamy scores of two bipartite quantum corre-
lation measures, namely, the negativity [46], a measure of bi-
partite entanglement, and quantum discord [4, 47], a quantum
correlation measure from the information-theoretic domain. We
choose a global noise, and three local noisy channels, namely,
the amplitude-damping (AD), the phase-damping (PD), and the
depolarizing (DP) channels as different models of environmen-
tal noise [21, 24, 48–52]. We demonstrate how the dynamics of

2

monogamy, in the case of three-qubit systems, exhibit qualita-
tively different behavior depending on whether the input quan-
tum state is chosen from the family of generalized Greenberger-
Horne-Zeilinger (gGHZ) state [53], or the generalized W (gW)
states [54–56], which are not equivalent under stochastic local
operations and classical communication (SLOCC). More specif-
ically, we show that monogamy scores of negativity as well as
quantum discord exhibit a monotonic decay with respect to the
corresponding noise parameter, when gGHZ state is subjected
to these noise models, while there exist non-monotonic dynam-
ics when the input state is the gW state. We also investigate
the trends of monogamy scores against noise, when arbitrary
three-qubit pure states belonging to the two inequivalent SLOCC
classes of three-qubit pure states, namely, the GHZ and the W
classes [56], are chosen as inputs. Moreover, we introduce a con-
cept called the “dynamics terminal”, which quantify the dura-
bility of quantum correlation measures under decoherence, and
show that it can distinguish between different quantum corre-
lation measures as well as different types of noise. The study
also reveals that for the PD channel, the negativity monogamy
score can exhibit a more robust behavior against noise strength
than that observed for the monogamy score of quantum discord,
which we call the “discord monogamy score”.

Besides characterizing the dynamical features of quantum
correlations under decoherence, it is also interesting to address
the reverse question as to whether the modes of environmental
noise can be identiﬁed by using the properties of quantum corre-
lations. Although a few studies have been motivated by similar
goal [57], the literature regarding this issue is extremely lim-
ited. While most of the studies have tried to distinguish different
types of noise by the different dynamical behavior of different
quantum correlations, concrete protocol to conclusively identify
the type of noise to which the quantum state is exposed is yet
to be introduced. As the second objective of this paper, we use
the highly entangled gGHZ and any gW states as resources, and
design a two-step protocol involving the monogamy relations of
negativity and quantum discord to conclusively distinguish the
type of noise applied to the quantum state, where the noise mod-
els include a global noise, and several local channels, namely,
AD, PD, and DP channels.

In Sec.

The paper is organized as follows.

II, we discuss
the dynamical behavior of the negativity and discord monogamy
scores, when the gGHZ and the gW states are subjected to dif-
ferent types of noise. The behavior of monogamy against noise,
when arbitrary three-qubit pure states are considered as input, is
also studied in this section. In Sec. III, the two-step channel dis-
crimination protocol with monogamy scores is presented. Sec.
IV presents the concluding remarks.

II. MONOGAMY OF QUANTUM CORRELATIONS UNDER

DECOHERENCE

In this section, we investigate the behavior of monogamy
scores corresponding to negativity and quantum discord for
three-qubit quantum states under the inﬂuence of global as
well as local noise. Brief descriptions of the quantum corre-
lation measures, namely, negativity and quantum discord, and
monogamy of quantum correlations can be found in Appendices

A and B. Discussions on different types of noise considered in
this paper are provided in Appendix C. Before considering arbi-
trary three-qubit pure states, we examine the generalized GHZ
(gGHZ), and the generalized W (gW) states as the input states
to various types of noise.

A. Generalized GHZ states

The generalized GHZ state, shared between three qubits, 1, 2,

and 3, reads as

|Ψi = a0|000i + a1|111i,

(1)

where a0 and a1 are the complex parameters satisfying |a0|2 +
|a1|2 = 1. In this paper, we consider qubit 1 as the nodal ob-
server while computing monogamy scores for negativity (δN ),
and quantum discord (δD). Note that the monogamy scores for
the gGHZ state, in the noiseless scenario, is always positive for
all quantum correlation measures including negativity and quan-
tum discord. This is due to the fact that the two-qubit reduced
density matrix ρ12 = ρ13 = |a0|2|00ih00| + |a1|2|11ih11|, ob-
tained from the gGHZ state, is a classically correlated two-qubit
state having vanishing quantum correlations, while the state |Ψi
in the 1 : 23 bipartition always has a non-zero value of quantum
correlation for a0, a1 6= 0.
Let us ﬁrst consider the case of global noise acting on the
gGHZ state. The ﬁnal state, ρgGHZ, as a function of the mixing
parameter, p, can be obtained following the methodology de-
scribed in Appendix C, which leads to two-party reduced states
ρgGHZ
12

and ρgGHZ

of the form

with I being a 4×4 identity matrix. They still remain classically
correlated with vanishing entanglement and quantum discord. In
case of AD, PD, and DP channels, the resulting states ρgGHZ are
obtained as (see Appendix C)

FIG. 1. (Color online.) Variations of δN (top panels), and δD (bottom panels) as functions of the noise parameter, p, and the state parameter, |a0|,
when gGHZ states are subjected to (from left to right) global noise, AD channel, PD channel, and DP channel. The absolute value of the other state
parameter, |a1|, is determined by normalization. The solid lines in the plots are the contours obtained by joining the points corresponding to a ﬁxed
value of either δN , or δD. In the case of δN , the lines, from low to high values of p, correspond to δN = 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1, while for δD, they
represent the contours of δD = 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15. The dashed lines, depicted in the case of δN under global noise (p = 0.8 line), δD under PD
channel (p = 0.8 line), δN under DP channel (p = 0.35 line), and δD under DP channel (p = 0.6 line), represent the boundaries above which the
corresponding monogamy score vanishes for most of the states. The regions marked by “R”, and enclosed by the boxes are deﬁned by the ranges
0.65 ≤ |a0| ≤ 0.7071, and 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6. The implications of these ranges of values are discussed in Sec. III. All the quantities plotted are
dimensionless, except for δD, which is in bits.

well as quantum discord for the other two channels also. In ef-

fect, even for p 6= 0, δN and δD are given by δN = N(cid:0)ρgGHZ
1:23 (cid:1)
and δD = D(cid:0)ρgGHZ
1:23 (cid:1) respectively, when the gGHZ state is sub-

jected to these four types of noise. Hence, both negativity and
quantum discord are always monogamous in the present sce-
nario, which can be applied to discriminate channels as we shall
see in Sec. III. Note that all the above discussions hold for the
gGHZ state of arbitrary number of parties subjected to different
types of local and global noise considered in this paper.

Using Eqs.

(3), analytical expressions of δN , as functions
of the noise parameter, p and the state parameter, |a0|, can be
obtained for different types of noise. In the case of the global
noise, it is given by

(9)
Note here that in all the above expressions, one can replace |a1|
byp1 − |a0|2.
On the other hand, analytically determining the discord
monogamy score, δD, for all the types of noise, is in general hard
due to the optimization required to compute quantum discord for
ρgGHZ in the 1 : 23 split [58]. So far, analytical determination
of quantum discord has been possible only for very restricted
class of mixed states [59, 60]. Hence, we employ numerical
optimization over the real parameters (θ, φ) of measurement in-
volved in the deﬁnition of quantum discord. The behavior of the
monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and quantum dis-
cord for different types of noise are depicted in Fig. 1, where
the top panels are for δN , and the bottom panels correspond
to δD. For all the noise models considered in this paper, δN
and δD monotonically decreases with increasing values of p for
a ﬁxed value of |a0|, and vanishes when noise is considerably
high, as can be clearly seen from the ﬁgures. In the case of dis-
cord, gGHZ state gives non-zero discord monogamy score when
the noise in the PD and the DP channels are less than 80% and
60%, respectively. In the rest of the cases, the corresponding

4

monogamy scores persist to be non-zero for higher values of the
noise-parameter (p ≥ 0.9).
It is clear from Fig. 1 that for global noise as well as for the
AD channel, the decay of δN and δD with increasing p is much
slower than that in the case of the PD and the DP channels. Note
also that in the case of the PD channel, δN persists to be non-
zero up to a higher value of noise parameter than that in the
case of δD. We shall elaborate on this issue in Sec. II C. The
regions (in Fig. 1) marked by “R”, and enclosed by the boxes,
in the case of δN under global noise and DP channel, and δD
under AD and PD channels, are deﬁned by the parameter ranges
0.65 ≤ |a0| ≤ 0.7071, and 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6, respectively. Note
that in the marked areas, δN > 0 for global noise, while δN = 0
under DP channel. On the other hand, in the region R, δD > 0
for both AD and PD channels. The implications of these values
are discussed in Sec. III.

B. Generalized W states

Let us now move to the monogamy scores of negativity and

quantum discord for the gW state, given by

|Φi = a0|001i + a1|010i + a2|100i,

(10)

12 = p

12 , of the form ρgW

where a0, a1 and a2 are complex numbers, satisfying |a0|2 +
|a1|2 + |a2|2 = 1. When the gW state is subjected to global
noise, the evolved three-qubit state, ρgW leads to the two-qubit
reduced density matrix, ρgW
4 I4 + (1 −
p)(cid:0)|a0|2P [|00i] + P [|ψi](cid:1) in the computational basis, where
P [|xi] = |xihx|, and |ψi = a1|01i + a2|10i. The reduced
state of qubits 1 and 3 can be determined from ρgW
12 by inter-
changing a0 and a1. One should note here that unlike the gGHZ
state, the reduced states with, as well as without, noise in the
current case, are no more “classical-classical” states, and pos-
sess non-vanishing entanglement as well as quantum discord.
For the AD channel, the three-qubit resulting state, starting from
|Φi, is given by ρgW = pP [|000i] + (1 − p)P [|Φi], leading to
ρgW
12 = [p + (1 − p)|a0|2]P [|00i] + (1 − p)P [|ψi], while ρgW
13
is obtained by interchanging a0 and a1 in ρgW
12 . In case of the
PD channel, we deﬁne the states | ˜ψi = (1 − p)(h0a0|001i +
h1a1|010i + h2a2|100i), and | ˜φi = h1a1|01i + h2a2|10i, so
that

In terms of | ˜ψi and | ˜φi, ρgW = P [| ˜ψi], and ρgW

obtained from ρgW
in the case of the DP channel is given by

(13)

The two-qubit reduced states, ρgW
13 , can be obtained
(12) by tracing out qubit 3 and 2 respectively. As
from Eq.
in the case of global noise, local density matrices, up to certain
value of the noise parameter, remains quantum correlated.

1. Negativity monogamy score

The evaluation of negativity monogamy score, in the present
case, becomes involved, in comparison to the case of the gGHZ
state, due to the non-zero contribution of all the terms in the
negativity monogamy score. However, analytical expressions
for δN can be determined for the global as well as different types
of local noise considered in this paper.
In case of the global
noise, negativity score, δg

qubit state requires, in principle, three separate optimizations
for the terms in Sc. However, information acquired via numer-
ical analysis may result in considerable reduction of the com-
putational complexity [29, 61–63]. Let us ﬁrst concentrate on
the computation of D(ρgW
1:23) under four types of noise consid-
ered in this paper. We perform extensive numerical search by
Haar uniformly generating a set of 3 × 106 random three-qubit
states of the form ρ′ for each of the types of noise considered in
this paper. We ﬁnd that for all such states, considering two sets
of values of the real parameters, (θ, φ), in projection measure-
ments involved in D(ρgW
1:23), is enough. These sets are given by
(i) θ = π/2, 0 ≤ φ < 2π, and (ii) θ = 0, π, 0 ≤ φ < 2π, which
correspond to projection measurements on the (x, y) plane, and
along the z axis of the Bloch sphere, respectively. Without any
loss of generality, one can consider a projection measurement
corresponding to the observable σx in the former case, while a

projection measurement corresponding to σz in the latter. We
refer to the set of states of the form ρgW, for which measurement
corresponding to σx, or σz provides the optimal measurement,
as the “special” set, denoted by S. In the present case, the set S
represents the set of all states of the form ρgW, for each of the
types of noise, according to our numerical analysis. The set of
states for which the optimization occurs for σx, is denoted by
Sx, while Sz represents the set of ρgW for which optimal mea-
surement corresponds to σz. Note that S = Sx ∪ Sz, while
Sx ∩ Sz = Φ, the null set.

12 and ρgW

The situation is a little different in the case of the two-qubit
states ρgW
13 , obtained from ρgW. We generate 3 × 106
states Haar uniformly, which are of the form ρgW
12 , and we ﬁnd
that, like in the case of (ρgW
1:23), there exists, for each type of
noise, a “special” set, S, of states ρgW
12 , for which optimization
occurs corresponding to either σx, or σz. However, in the case
of global noise and PD channel, a small fraction of ρgW
12 does not
belong to S, and the optimization of D(ρgW
12 ), for these states,

occur for other values of (θ, φ). Let the maximum absolute error,
resulting from the assumption that all the three-qubit states of
the form ρgW
12 belong to S, in the case of the global noise and PD
channel, is ε. Our numerical analysis provides an upper bound
of ε, denoted by εmax, which is of the order of 10−3 in the case
of both types of noise. Table I displays our ﬁndings regarding the
percentages of states of the form ρgW and ρgW
12 , that belong to the
sets Sx, Sz, and do not belong to S for all the four types of noise.
The last column (column (IV)) tabulates the values of εmax in
the relevant cases. From now on, unless otherwise mentioned,
we determine the values of δD by computing quantum discord
with the assumption that the states either belong to Sx or Sz.

3. Behavior of monogamy under moderate noise

Let us now quantitatively study the behavior of monogamy
scores, δN and δD, of the gW states for a ﬁxed noise parame-
ter. We determine the fractions of the set of ρgW, for which the
monogamy score corresponding to the chosen quantum correla-
tion measure is strictly greater than, equal to, and strictly less
than zero. We study the variation of these fractions with the
change in values of the noise parameter for the speciﬁed type
of noise. The variations of the three different fractions, as de-
scribed above, with respect to p, are depicted in Fig. 2. Let us
now investigate the effect of moderate noise on the monogamy

scores. In the present study, we choose a range of p given by
0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6 (marked by the shaded regions in the panels in
Fig. 2), which is moderate in comparison to the lower and upper
bounds of p. From Fig. 2, it is clear that for moderate values of
p (viz. 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6), in the case of global noise as well as the
AD channel, most of the states have δN > 0, while for the DP
channel, δN = 0 for 100% of the states. Remarkably, for the PD
channel, all the states have δN > 0 when the noise parameter is
in the moderate range.

The situation is different for discord monogamy score. It is
found that δD ≥ 0 for almost the entire range of moderate values
of p, when gW states are subjected to global noise. In the case
of the AD channel, δD < 0 for the entire range 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6.
In this scenario, δD < 0 for the entire range of p, except only
at p = 1, the fully decohered states. Also, for the PD channel,
δD < 0 for moderate p except when p ≈ 0.6. However, in the
case of the DP channel, δD ≥ 0 for 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6. Hence it is
clear that the monogamy of negativity behaves differently than
the monogamy of quantum discord, in the case of global noise,
and local channels considered in this paper. These results are of
prime importance to our goal of channel discrimination, which
will be discussed in Sec. III.

4. Types of dynamics: Monotonic vs. non-monotonic

In case of the gW state subjected to global or local noise, the
set of different types of dynamics that δN and δD undergo is far
richer compared to that for gGHZ states. While only monotonic
decay of δN and δD with increasing p is found in the latter case,
non-monotonic dynamics of monogamy scores emerges in the
former. As an example, consider the set of states of the form |Φi
(of Eq. (10)) having a ﬁxed value of |a2|. The states in the set
can be represented by the different allowed values of the abso-
lute value of the free parameter, a0. Fig. 3 depicts the landscapes
of δN , in the case of global noise, and of δD, in the case of the
AD channel, as functions of |a0| and p, for |a2| = 0.7. The
solid lines in the ﬁgures represent contours obtained by joining
the points having a constant value of either δN , or δD. Note that
the contours form closed curves, and from outside to inside, the
lines represent increasing values of δN and δD. The dashed lines
in the plots represent the dynamics of δN , in the case of global
noise, and δD, in the case of the AD channel, when the input gW
state is taken with |a0| = 0.5. The behavior of the monogamy
scores with increasing values of p are non-monotonic, as clearly
indicated from the values of δN and δD, represented by different
shades in Fig. 3. An increase in the monogamy scores can be
argued to be a signature of increase in quantumness. Although
noise destroys quantum correlations, here we see the opposite

for higher values of p (p ≥ 0.6), while δD vanishes. Note that for the

by obtaining non-monotonicity of monogamy score with the in-
crease of p.
Types of dynamics. Now we catalog four “typical” dynamics
proﬁles observed for both δN and δD for global noise as well
as for AD, PD, and DP local channels. a. In the ﬁrst proﬁle,
δQ(p = 0) ≥ 0, and δQ(p) goes to zero non-monotonically as
p → 1. b. For the second one, δQ(p) monotonically goes to
zero when p increases, with δQ(p = 0) ≥ 0. c. In contrast to
the ﬁrst two proﬁles, δQ(p = 0) < 0 for the third proﬁle. With
an increase of p, δQ vanishes non-monotonically. d. Similar
to the third proﬁle, the fourth and the ﬁnal proﬁle starts with a
non-monogamous scenario (δQ(p = 0) < 0). However, with
increasing p, δQ(p) goes to zero monotonically as p → 1.
Evidently, the frequencies of occurrence of the dynamics
types a, b, c, and d must vary for different types of noise, and
for different observables, viz., δN , and δD. To estimate these, we
prepare a sample of 106 Haar-uniformly generated gW states as
input, which can be subjected to each of the types of noise, and
study the dynamics proﬁles of the states. We ﬁnd that at p = 0,
75.195% of the gW states are monogamous when negativity is
considered, while only 13.333% of them are monogamous with

respect to quantum discord. When the value of p is increased,
the four types of dynamics are found to occur with different fre-
quencies in the case of the global noise and the local channels
II). Note that for δN , type-a is more frequent in
(see Table.
the case of global noise as well as for the PD and DP channels,
while type-b occurs mostly in the case of the AD channel. The
frequency of occurrence of d is much less compared to that of
a, b, and c for the negativity monogamy score. Among all the
noisy channels, the non-monotonic decay of δN occurs close to
100% of times when global noise acts on the gW state, irrespec-
tive of the sign of δN at p = 0. On the other hand, in the case
of δD, frequency of occurrence of c and d is high in the cases of
global noise and the AD channel, while the same is moderate in
the case of the PD and the DP channels.

5. Dynamics terminal

So far, we have qualitatively discussed and characterized the
dynamics of δN and δD under the application of global and local
noise to the gW state. It is observed as well as intuitively clear
that the persistence of the monogamy scores, when subjected to
noise, must be different for different types of noise considered
in this paper. To analyze this quantitatively, for a given state,
ρ, we deﬁne the “dynamics terminal”, pt, which is given by the
value of the noise parameter, p, at which the monogamy score
vanishes, and remains so for pt ≤ p ≤ 1. The value of pt
is characteristic to the input state, |Φi, and the type of noise
applied to it. A high value of pt implies a high persistence of the
monogamy score for the state |Φi against the particular type of
noise applied to it. It is clear that for gW states as the input states,
pt may assume a range of values since the dynamics terminal
will clearly assume different values for different input gW states,
when the type of noise is ﬁxed. However, for a speciﬁc type of
noise, the average value of pt, denoted by hpti, and deﬁned by

hpti =Z 1

0

ptP (pt)dpt,

(18)

provides a scale for the “high” values of the noise parame-
ter. Here, P (pt) is the normalized probability density function
(PDF) such that P (pt)dpt provides the probability that for an
arbitrary three-qubit gW state under the ﬁxed type of noise, the

8

value of pt lies between pt and pt + dpt. Note that the full range
of the allowed values of pt is given by 0 ≤ pt ≤ 1, which fol-
lows from the deﬁnition of the noise parameter.
It is important to check whether hpti can distinguish between
different types of noise. In order to determine P (pt), we Haar
uniformly generate 106 gW states for each of the four kinds of
noise, and study their dynamics proﬁles to determine hpti. The
variations of P (pt) against pt are given in Fig. 4. It is clear from
the ﬁgure that the maximum possible value of pt is considerably
different in the case of δN and δD, when the type of noise is
ﬁxed. The values of hpti corresponding to δN and δD, calcu-
lated from Eq. (18), for global noise, AD channel, PD channel,
and DP channel are given in Table III. Note that the dynamics
terminal corresponding to δD is higher than that corresponding
to δN in the case of the global noise, AD channel, and the DP
channel, while the trend is reversed in the case of the PD chan-
nel. Note also that the behavior of hpti corresponding to δN ,
in the results obtained previously in Sec. II B 3 in the case of
the PD channel, is in good agreement with the value of hpti cor-
responding to δN , which is maximum for the PD channel, and
minimum for the DP channel. The implication of this result is
elaborated in Sec. II C. It is interesting to note here that there
can not be any bipartite state for which N > 0 while D = 0.
However, such a situation is possible in the case of δN and δD.
We shall discuss this issue in Sec. II C in detail.
Note. Due to the extensive numerical effort required for deter-
mining the values of D(ρgW
13 ) in comput-
ing δD when p > 0, we employ the constrained optimization
corresponding to σx and σz only, as discussed in Sec. II B 2, to
obtain several important statistics reported in Sec. II B 3, II B 4,
and II B 5. However, the error in the various statistics obtained
for different channels, due to this approximation, is insigniﬁ-
cant, and does not change the qualitative aspects of the results.
Note that in all the occasions in this paper, where actual value
of δD has been plotted, or reported, exact optimization has been
carried out using numerical techniques.

C. Robustness of negativity monogamy score

As already mentioned in the Introduction, in the bipartite
domain, it has been observed that quantum discord vanishes
asymptotically with increasing noise strength, p, when quan-
tum states are exposed to local noise. On the other hand, en-
tanglement measures undergo a “sudden death” at a ﬁnite value
of p under similar noise, indicating a more fragile behavior than
quantum discord. Interestingly, an opposite trend is observed

when monogamy of quantum correlations are subjected to lo-
cal noisy channels. The variation of δN and δD with |a0| and
p in the case of PD channels with gGHZ states as input states
(Fig. 1) indicates that there exists gGHZ states for which δN
persists longer than δD for higher values of the noise parame-

ter, p (p ≥ 0.8). In Sec.
the value of hpti for negativity monogamy score, in the case of
the DP channel, is much larger compared to that of the discord
monogamy score. Also, Fig. 2 indicates that for higher values
of p (0.6 ≤ p ≤ 0.9), 100% of gW states have δN > 0 when
the noise is of PD type. Note that for all such states, δD ≤ 0.
This implies that there is a ﬁnite probability of ﬁnding gW states
which, when subjected to PD channel, will evolve into a state
ρgW with δN > 0, but δD = 0.

We present two speciﬁc examples to establish such obser-
vations. Our ﬁrst example is the gGHZ states represented by
|a0| = 0.6, while the second example is the gW states given in
Eq. (10) with a0 = −0.287 − 0.552i, and a1 = 0.637 + 0.23i.
The behavior of δN and δD against p are plotted in Fig. 5, where
the quantum discord components of δD are computed via exact
numerical optimization. It is clear from the ﬁgure that in both the
cases, δN persists longer than δD at higher end of noise param-
eter. One must note here that the quantum discord components
of δD cancel each other at higher noise, while being individually
non-zero. Hence the observation of δN > 0 in situations where
δD = 0 is consistent with the fact that entanglement measures
vanish for zero discordant states in bipartite systems. Therefore,
it is evident that negativity monogamy score, in the presence of
PD noise, exhibits a more robust behavior compared to that of
the discord monogamy score. This is in contrast to the usual ob-
servation for bipartite quantum discord and entanglement mea-
sures.

D. Arbitrary tripartite pure states

Hitherto, we have investigated gGHZ and gW states, for
which the effects of various noisy channels on monogamy scores
can be addressed analytically up to certain extent. To complete
the investigation for three-qubit states as input, we now con-
sider the two mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes of three-
qubit states, viz., the GHZ class and the W class [56]. These
two classes, inequivalent under stochastic local operations and
classical communication (SLOCC), together span the entire set
of three-qubit pure states [56]. An arbitrary three-qubit pure
state from the GHZ class, up to local unitary operations, can be

parametrized as |ψGHZi = √K(cδ|000i+sδeiϕ|ϕαi|ϕβi|ϕγi),
where |ϕki = ck|0i + sk|1i with ck = cos k, sk = sin k,
k = α, β, γ, and K = (1 + 2cδsδcαcβcγcϕ)−1 ∈ ( 1
2 ,∞)
is the normalization factor. Here, the ranges for the ﬁve real
parameters are δ ∈ (0, π/4], α, β, γ ∈ (0, π/2] and ϕ ∈
[0, 2π). On the other hand, a three-qubit pure state from the
W class, up to local unitaries, can be written in terms of three
real parameters as |ψWi = √a|001i + √b|010i + √c|100i +
p1 − (a + b + c)|000i, where a, b, c ≥ 0. Due to higher num-

ber of state parameters in arbitrary three-qubit pure states chosen
from these classes, determining compact forms for δN as well as
δD is difﬁcult. Also, the constrained optimization, as discussed
in Sec. II B 2, is not applicable due to the high absolute error

numerical optimization technique to compute quantum discord
in discord monogamy scores of these states. We Haar-uniformly
generate 104 states from each of the two classes – the GHZ class

mine the percentage of states for which negativity and discord

and study the variation of these percentages with varying noise
parameter.

The variation of the percentages of three-qubit pure states
from the GHZ class, for which δN and δD are >, =, and < 0,
against p is given in Fig. 6(a), while the same for the W class
states are presented in Fig. 6(b). The percentages vary non-
monotonically with varying noise parameter, and the percentage
of states for which the monogamy scores corresponding to neg-
ativity and quantum discord are equal to zero, for both classes of
states, tend to become 100% with increasing p, as expected. For
both the classes, this trend is considerably slower in the case of
global noise, AD channel, and PD channel, in comparison to that
for the DP channel. The patterns in the W class states are similar
to those in the case of gW states, except for discord monogamy
score under PD channel. While no gW states have a strictly pos-
itive δD for higher values of p, in the case of W class states,
the corresponding fraction increases with increasing p, reaches
a maximum value at moderately high p, and then, as expected,
decreases to zero as p → 1.

III. CHANNEL DISCRIMINATION VIA MONOGAMY

In this section, we investigate the second objective of this pa-
per, and address the question whether monogamy of quantum
correlations can be applied to conclusively detect the type of
noise to which the quantum state is exposed. In particular, we
propose a two-step protocol to discriminate global noise as well
as local channels, namely, AD, PD, and DP channels, via nega-
tivity and discord monogamy score, by using a gW state and a
gGHZ state as resources. The choice of observable in the sec-
ond step is determined according to the outcome of the ﬁrst step.
The assumptions required for the success of the protocol are (i)
that the strength of the noise is moderate, viz., 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6,
and (ii) that the given noisy channel can be used twice. Below,
by an unknown channel, we shall mean one of th four channels,
among global noise, AD, PD, and DP channels.

values of ∆, where from low to high value of p, the lines stand for

the protocol are as follows. 1. Given an unknown channel, the
ﬁrst step is to send an arbitrary gW state through that channel
and to measure the value of δD for the output state. 2. The
next step is to send a gGHZ state with high entanglement (e.g.,
0.65 ≤ |a0| ≤ 0.7071) through the channel, and to measure the
monogamy score corresponding to either negativity, or quantum
discord, subject to the outcome of the ﬁrst step. If δD ≥ 0 in
the ﬁrst step, δN is chosen as the observable, while for δD < 0
in step 1, discord monogamy score can conclusively identify the
type of noise in the channel (as shown schematically in Fig. 7).
Now we explain the implications of the output of the protocol.
If δD < 0 in step 1 for moderate values of p, then the original gW
state was subjected to either the AD, or the PD channel, while a
nonnegative δD implies that the noise was either global, or DP.
This is clear from the variation of the percentages of states for
which δD ≥ 0 and < 0 in the range 0.4 ≤ p ≤ 0.6, as depicted
in Fig. 2. Hence, the ﬁrst step divides the four types of noise in
a block – the duo of AD and PD channels, and global noise and
DP channel.

First, let us assume that δD ≥ 0 in the ﬁrst step, which leads

one to choose δN as observable in the second step of the strategy.
For δN > 0 in the second step, the type of noise that acts on the
gGHZ state is the global noise, while δN = 0 implies that the
channel is DP. This can be understood from the boxed regions
marked “R” in Fig. 1, where δN = 0 for the DP channel, while
δN > 0 for global noise. On the other hand, if the outcome
of the ﬁrst step is δD < 0, the channel is either AD, or PD. In
this situation, δD is always positive when the input state is the
gGHZ state with a speciﬁc value of |a0| in the range mentioned
before, and so the discrimination protocol is more involved. In
particular, we observe that in the marked region “R” in Fig. 1,
D ≤ 0.3 for the AD channel, while for the PD noise,
0.13 ≤ δad
0.019 ≤ δpd

D ≤ 0.09. The variation of ∆ = δad
difference between the values of discord monogamy score in the
case of AD channel (δad
D ), with |a0| and
p in the region “R” in Fig. 1 is plotted in Fig. 8. We notice
that there is no overlap between the allowed ranges of δD for
the two channels (as also indicated by the absence of the value
∆ = 0 in Fig. 8), implying that δD can conclusively distinguish
between the AD and the PD channels. The possible encoding of
the outcomes of the two-step protocol, and their implications are
tabulated in Table IV.
Remark 1. The ﬁrst step of our channel discrimination protocol
requires not the value, but only the sign of δD, while the second
step requires an estimation of the discord monogamy score, δD,
for AD and PD channels.
Remark 2. Although the range of values of δD are non-
overlapping for AD and PD channels when the state parameter
is in the range 0.6 < |a0| < 0.7071, the difference between
the values corresponding to the lower bound of δad
D , and upper
bound of δpd
D decreases with relaxing the lower bound of |a0|.
Hence, the lower bound of the allowed range of |a0| can be re-
D can be
laxed depending on the accuracy with which δad
estimated with the current technology in hand. The best result is
obtained for the three-qubit GHZ state, for which |a0| = 1/√2.

Remark 3. In the presence of high noise (p > 0.6), our protocol
may fail to distinguish the type of noise applied to the quantum
state. This is because both δD and δN may vanish in the case of
both gGHZ state and gW state when the noise strength is high.
It is also clear that the above distinguishing protocol fails when
p ≈ 0.

IV. CONCLUSION

Summarizing, we have investigated the patterns of the
monogamy property of quantum correlations using monogamy
score as the observable, when three-qubit systems are subjected
to global noise as well as local noisy channels, viz. amplitude-
damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels. As the
quantum correlation measures that are used to constitute the
monogamy score, we chose negativity and quantum discord,
and found that the dynamics of monogamy score, when gen-
eralized GHZ states are subjected to different types of noise, is
qualitatively different from that of the generalized W state as in-
put. While monogamy score corresponding to both the quantum
correlation measures exhibit a monotonic decay with increas-
ing noise in the former case, non-monotonic dynamics takes

11

place in the latter, giving rise to a rich set of dynamical pro-
ﬁles. We deﬁne a characteristic noise scale, called the “dynam-
ics terminal”, that quantiﬁes the persistence of the monogamy
score corresponding to a particular measure of quantum corre-
lation, when the state is subjected to a speciﬁc type of noise.
We show that the dynamics terminal can distinguish between
the different noise models, and indicates that the depolarizing
channel destroys monogamy scores faster compared to the other
types of noise. To investigate how the monogamy property be-
haves against increasing noise, we investigate the variation of
the fraction of states with increasing value of the noise param-
eter, when the input states are chosen from the GHZ and the W
class. We also show that the negativity monogamy score may
exhibit a more robust behavior against phase damping noise,
compared to the discord monogamy score, which is in contrast
to the usual observation regarding bipartite entanglement mea-
sures and quantum discord. As an usefulness of such study,
we propose a two-step channel discrimination protocol that can
conclusively identify the different types of noise by considering
monogamy scores and by using the gGHZ and the gW states as
resources.

Appendix A: Measures of quantum correlations

In this paper, we restrict ourselves to two speciﬁc measures,
namely, negativity and quantum discord. The ﬁrst one be-
longs to the quantum correlations deﬁned in the entanglement-
separability domain, while the second one is an information-
theoretic quantum correlation measure.
Negativity.
its negativity [46],
N (ρAB), is deﬁned as the absolute value of the sum of the neg-
ative eigenvalues of ρTA
AB denotes the partial trans-
pose of ρAB with respect to the subsystem A. Alternatively, it is
expressed as

where kMk1 ≡ tr√M †M is the trace-norm of the matrix M .

Quantum Discord. Quantum discord [4] is deﬁned as the dif-
ference between the “total correlation” [47] and the “classical
correlation” [4] present in the composite system, described by
the bipartite state ρAB. The total correlation can be quantiﬁed
as the quantum mutual information, and is given by
I(ρAB) = S(ρA) + S(ρB) − S(ρAB),

(A2)
where S(̺) = −tr(̺ log2 ̺) is the von Neumann entropy of ̺,
and ρA(B) are the local density matrices of ρAB, obtained as
ρA(B) = trB(A) [ρAB]. On the other hand, the classical correla-
tion is deﬁned as

J (ρAB) = S(ρB) − S(ρB|A),

(A3)

12

where the conditional entropy, S(ρB|A), is given by

S(ρB|A) = min

{Pi}Xi

piS(ρB|i).

(A4)

Here, S(ρB|A) is conditioned over measurement performed on
A with a rank-one projection-valued measurements {Pi}, pro-
ducing the states ρB|i = 1
trA[(Pi ⊗ IB)ρAB(Pi ⊗ IB)], with
pi
probability pi = tr[(Pi ⊗ IB)ρAB(Pi ⊗ IB)], IB being the iden-
tity operator in the Hilbert space of B. From Eqs. (A2) and
(A3), quantum discord can be obtained as

D(ρAB) = I(ρAB) − J (ρAB).

(A5)

Note. The difﬁculty in the computation of quantum discord
arises due to the optimization involved in the deﬁnition of clas-
sical correlation of the state ρAB [58].
In the case of a pure
bipartite state ρAB, quantum discord reduces to S(ρA), the von
Neumann entropy of the local density matrix ρA [35]. On the
other hand, there are only a few examples of mixed bipartite
states, for which quantum discord can be obtained analytically
[59, 60]. For an arbitrary mixed bipartite state ρAB, computation
of quantum discord involves adaptation of numerical optimiza-
tion techniques [29, 61–63]. In the case of a C2 ⊗ Cd system,
if measurement is performed on the qubit, the rank-1 projectors,
{Pi = |ΦiihΦi|, i = 1, 2}, can be parametrized as

θ
2|0i + eiφ sin

|Φ1i = cos
|Φ2i = −e−iφ sin

θ
2|1i,
θ
2|1i.

θ
2|0i + cos

(A6)

The optimization, in this case, is to be performed over the space
of the real parameters (θ, φ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ φ < 2π.

Appendix B: Monogamy of Quantum Correlations

Let us now introduce the concept of monogamy [32, 33] for a
quantum correlation measure, Q. Monogamy helps in exploring
the amount of quantum correlations shared among the subsys-
tems of a quantum system. All the known quantum correlation
measures qualitatively follow a monogamy relation. In the case
of a tripartite system, it implies that if two of the parties are max-
imally quantum correlated, then there can not be any quantum
correlation between either of these two parties with the third one.
Importantly, classical correlations do not have such restrictions.
We will now quantify the monogamy constraint for an arbitrary
bipartite quantum correlation measure, say Q. An n-party state,
ρA1A2···An, shared between the parties, A1, A2,··· , An, is said
to be monogamous under the quantum correlation measure Q, if
it follows the monogamy inequality given by

Q(ρA1:A2···An ) ≥

n

Xj=2

Q(ρA1Aj ),

(B1)

where ρA1Aj is obtained from ρA1A2···An by tracing out all the
parties except A1 and Aj. Otherwise, it is non-monogamous.
Here we call the party A1 as the nodal observer. In this respect,

the “monogamy score” with respect to Q, for the n-party state,
ρA1A2···An, is deﬁned as [37]

δQ = Q(ρA1:A2···An ) −

n

Xj=2

Q(ρA1Aj ).

(B2)

Therefore, positivity of δQ for a given quantum state implies
monogamy of quantum correlation measure Q for that state.
Note. The choice of measurement, in the deﬁnition of quan-
tum discord, puts an inherent asymmetry in the measure. In this
paper, unless otherwise stated, the measurement is performed on
the ﬁrst subsystem of the bipartite quantum system. This implies
that while computing D(ρA1Aj ) to determine δQ, the measure-
ment is always performed on the nodal observer.

Appendix C: Decoherence under global and local noise

A quantum system inevitably interacts with its environment
and eventually decoheres, and looses its quantum correlations.
Such a decohering process can be described by a completely
positive trace preserving (CPTP) map, E, which, acting on the
quantum system, ρ, transforms the state as [21, 24, 48–52]

ρ → ρ′ = E(ρ).

(C1)

The noise can act either globally, or locally on each subsystem
of the system of interest. In the present study, we consider both
the scenarios.
Global noise. In this case, we consider an environment that acts
globally on a system of dimension dn and in the state ρ, for
which the r resulting state is given by

ρ′ =

p
dn I + (1 − p)ρ,

(C2)

where p is the mixing parameter (0 ≤ p ≤ 1), and I is the
identity operator in the Hilbert space of the system. Note that
p = 0 stands for the noiseless case, while p = 1 corresponds to
the fully decohered state.
Local noise. For a composite quantum system having n spa-
tially separated subsystems, it is reasonable to assume that the
environment acts independently and locally on each of the sub-
systems. We now brieﬂy describe various such local noisy chan-
nels.

The dynamics of a closed quantum system is described by a
unitary transformation. To describe the dynamics of an open
quantum system, which is interacting with its environment, one
can assume that the system and the environment together form a
closed quantum system, whose state, ρ, is given by ρ = ρs ⊗ ρe,
with ρs and ρe being respectively the states of the system and the
environment. The next step would be to apply a unitary trans-
formation to the given composite system and ﬁnally trace out
the environment part to obtain the reduced state of the changed
system. In this case, quantum operations can be considered in
the operator-sum representation [49], written explicitly in terms
of operators on the Hilbert space of the system as follows:

ρ′

s = tre[U (ρs ⊗ ρe)U †] =Xk

EkρsE†
k,

(C3)

where the operators {Ek} are known as Kraus operators [24,
49, 51, 52] and satisfy Pk E†
kEk = I. For a system “s” of
dimension d, any quantum operation can be represented by at
most d2 Kraus operators.

For an n-partite system, ρA1A2···An, in arbitrary dimensions,
after the actions of the local environments on the subsystems,
the evolved state, ρ′

, can be written as

we describe the Kraus operators of a number of single-qubit
quantum channels, namely, the amplitude- and phase-damping,
and depolarizing channels [24, 52].

nario where energy dissipation from a quantum system is al-
lowed. The Kraus operators for a single-qubit AD channel are
given by

off-diagonal elements, resulting in information loss about its co-
herence. The single qubit Kraus operators for the PD channel
are given by

13

√p
2

√p
2

(I + σ3), E2 =

E0 =p1 − pI, E1 =

, (I− σ3), (C6)
where I is the identity matrix in the qubit Hilbert space, and p is
again the noise-strength.
Depolarizing channel. In the case of the DP channel, the input
qubit is depolarized, that is, replaced by the completely mixed
state I
2 , with probability p and is left unaltered with probability
(1 − p). Such an operation on the single-qubit state ρ is repre-
sented by

ρ′ =

p
2

I + (1 − p)ρ.

(C7)

Note that the form in Eq. (C7) is not in the operator-sum repre-
sentation. The operation given in Eq. (C7) is often parametrized
as

ρ′ = (1 − p)ρ +

p

(σ1ρσ1 + σ2ρσ2 + σ3ρσ3),

(C8)

E0 =(cid:18) 1

0

0 √1 − p(cid:19) , E1 =(cid:18) 0 √p
0 (cid:19) ,

0

with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, where p corresponds to the strength of the noise
acting on the input qubit state.
Phase-damping channel. As an example of a non-dissipative
channel, we consider the PD channel. A state, after passing
through the PD channel, or the “dephasing” channel, decays its

(C5)

leading to single qubit Kraus operators of the form given by

E0 =p1 − pI, E1 =r p

σ3.
(C9)
Remark. Similar to the case of global noise, in the case of local
noisy channels also, the noiseless case is denoted by p = 0,
while p = 1 represents maximal disturbance of the state.

σ2, E3 =r p

σ1, E2 =r p
