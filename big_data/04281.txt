Spin loss at metallic interfaces is usually quantiﬁed by the empirical parameter δ obtained by
matching the magnetoresistance data for multilayers to the Valet-Fert model. We derive the re-
lation of this parameter to the spin-ﬂip transmission and reﬂection probabilities at an individual
interface by employing the circuit theory and the scattering matrix approaches. It is found that δ is
proportional to the square root of the probability of spin-ﬂip scattering. We calculate the spin-ﬂip
transmission probability for ﬂat and rough Cu/Pd interfaces using the Landauer-B¨uttiker method
based on the ﬁrst-principles electronic structure and ﬁnd δ in reasonable agreement with experiment.

Spin transport at metallic interfaces is an essential in-
gredient of various spintronic device concepts, such as
giant magnetoresistance [1], spin-transfer torque [2], and
spin pumping [3]. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays an
important role in many such devices, sometimes being
central to the device concept, as in spin-orbit torque bi-
layers [4], and sometimes modifying the eﬀects quanti-
tatively [5–8]. It is unavoidably present in spin current
detectors based on the inverse spin-Hall eﬀect [9], which
are routinely used in spin caloritronic devices [10].

SOC makes spin current discontinuous across an in-
terface. To quantify this eﬀect experimentally, the stan-
dard protocol [5] is to measure the magnetoresistance,
with current ﬂow perpendicular to the planes (CPP), of
a FN1(N2N1)N F spin valve, where N1 and N2 are two
diﬀerent nonmagnetic metals and F a ferromagnet, as
a function of the number of repeats N . The data are
then mapped to the phenomenological Valet-Fert model
[11], treating the interface as a layer of thickness tI , re-
sistivity ρI , and spin-diﬀusion length lI
sf . The parameter
δ = tI /lI
sf is used to characterize spin loss at the interface
[5, 6], but its relation to the scattering properties of an in-
dividual interface is not known. Generally, the mapping
to the Valet-Fert model does not even have enough pa-
rameters to fully describe spin-non-conserving scattering,
because the spin-ﬂip transmittance and the reﬂectances
on two sides are independent parameters. For example,
the spin-ﬂip reﬂectance is relevant for the spin-injection
problem [12].

In this paper, we apply the scattering matrix and the
circuit theory approaches in order to establish the cor-
respondence between the phenomenological parameter δ,
extracted from GMR-like measurements, and the calcu-
lable spin-resolved transmittance and reﬂectance proper-
ties of an individual interface. The latter are calculated
from ﬁrst principles for the Cu/Pd interface.

The thicknesses of diﬀerent layers used in experiments
are typically about 3 nm. For such layer thicknesses
the resistance of each individual layer is at least a few
times smaller than the resistance of each interface [5], as
long as nominally pure materials are used. For example,
the area-resistance products of a 3-nm layer of nominally

pure Pd and of the Cu/Pd interface are about 0.14 and
0.45 fΩ·m2, respectively. Therefore, in the following we
treat the problem under the assumption that the bulk re-
sistances are negligibly small compared to the interface
resistances; this simpliﬁes the expressions considerably.

a. Valet-Fert theory. To facilitate comparison with
scattering theory, it is convenient to consider a periodic
multilayer in which the FN1(N2N1)N block repeats itself.
We solve the Valet-Fert equations in this multilayer for
parallel and alternating antiparallel conﬁgurations using
the transfer-matrix approach. Taking the limit in which
the resistance is dominated by and spin-ﬂip scattering is
present only at N1/N2 interfaces, we ﬁnd a simple ex-
pression for the magnetoresistance:
(βr∗

rI

(1)
where m = 2N is the number of interfaces, β the spin
asymmetry, r∗
F tF the eﬀective resistance, tF the
thickness, and ρ∗
F = (ρ↑ + ρ↓)/4 the eﬀective resistivity
of the ferromagnet, and rI = ρI tI is the resistance of the
interface.

b. Scattering theory. Since we are dealing with low-
resistance metallic interfaces, the relevant resistances are
those measured in the two-terminal setup, rather than
the four-terminal resistances measured in a constriction
or calculated within the Landauer-B¨uttiker approach.
For spin-conserving interfaces the relation between the
two is well-known [13]: the interface resistance appear-
ing in series-resistor expressions is obtained from the
Landauer-B¨uttiker resistance by subtracting the spurious
contribution of the Sharvin resistance. The approach of
Ref. 13, which takes into account the deviations of the
distribution functions from equilibrium, can be readily
applied to the periodic multilayer introduced above.

We use the result of Ref. 13 for the two-terminal con-

ductance GS directly:

in spin space. The transmission and reﬂection matri-
ces are calculated using the semiclassical concatenation
rules [14]. Consistently with the Valet-Fert model used
above, spin-ﬂip scattering in the ferromagnetic layers is
neglected, and the spin-diagonal transmission and reﬂec-
tion matrices across half of the ferromagnetic layer are
written as

1 + sσ

iσ,jσ(cid:48) =

sσδσσ(cid:48)
1 + sσ

(3)

where M1 is the number of conducting channels per spin
in the adjacent normal metal, and sσ = rσM1/2, where
rσ is the resistance of one spin channel (which includes
the F/N interface resistance). The factor 1
2 comes from
the fact that the supercell period contains half of the
F layer at each edge. Concatenation of two such “half-
thick” F layers leads to the correct scattering matrices
for the whole F layer. The results of this calculation are
identical to those of the circuit theory, Eqs. (6)-(7).

c. Circuit theory. A more general approach, not
limited to periodic structures, is to employ the magne-
toelectronic circuit theory [15, 16] extended to include
spin-ﬂip scattering (see Appendix A). For an adjacent
pair of layers L1, L2 in a magnetic multilayer, the charge
I 0 and spin ¯I s currents in, say, layer L2 are:

Here ∆f 0 = f 0
2 are interfacial
drops of charge and spin components of the distribution
function. We introduced 28 parameters, including one
scalar charge conductance G, three vector conductances
¯Gs, ¯Gt and ¯Gr, and two tensor conductances ˆGt and ˆGr
(see Appendix A for their deﬁnitions and relation to the
notation used in Ref. [17]). Equations (4)-(5) represent
the most general form of the boundary conditions;
in
particular, they include the eﬀects of the mixing con-
ductances, which are important in noncollinear magnetic
multilayers [18–20]. They also reproduce the generaliza-
tion of Valet-Fert theory to noncollinear systems [31, 32].
The expressions simplify for a non-magnetic, axially
symmetric interface, for which ¯Gs = ¯Gt = ¯Gr = 0, and
the tensors ˆGt and ˆGr are diagonal in the axial reference
frame. For highly transparent interfaces all conductances
should be properly renormalized [21, 22] (see Appendix
B).

We apply the circuit theory to the FN1(N2N1)N F spin
valve, using Kirchhoﬀ’s rules for charge and spin conser-
vation in each node. For simplicity, we assume that the
spin accumulation is aligned with one of the symmetry
axes; the general case can be treated as a superposition
of the three alignments. Retaining only ﬁrst-order terms
in spin-ﬂip scattering at each concatenation step, we ﬁnd
the magnetoresistance

and Gr

malized (two-terminal) [13] conductance of the inter-

face: 2/(cid:101)G = 2/G − 1/2M1 − 1/2M2. Other conduc-

tances should also be renormalized after being calculated
along the symmetry axes, i.e., along ⊥ and (cid:107) directions.
When the number of layers is large, we can neglect m-
independent terms and rewrite (6) as

renormalized by the Sharvin resistance when calculated
up to the ﬁrst order in the spin-ﬂip processes.
To establish correspondence with the Valet-Fert model,
we note that, to second order in x, we have x/ sinh x ≈
(1 − x2/6). Relating Eq. (7) and (1), we ﬁnd

δ2 = 2

Gsl(cid:101)G

The assumption of small mδ is, however, not essential.
Applying Eqs. (4)-(5) to three contiguous non-magnetic
layers (see Appendix C), we ﬁnd the following ﬁnite-
diﬀerence equation for the spin accumulation:

i = C1eδi + C2e−δi,
f s

(10)

identical to the solution of the Valet-Fert equations [11]
and generalizes the deﬁnition of δ (8) to the strong spin-
ﬂip scattering case. If the spin-ﬂip scattering is weak, we
recover Eq. (8), since in this limit δ ≈ D.

Eq. (8) shows that δ is proportional not to the spin-
ﬂip scattering probability at the interface (as it has been
usually assumed [5]), but to its square root. Thus, for
example, a seemingly large value δ ≈ 0.24 deduced ex-
perimentally for the Cu/Pd interface corresponds to a
spin-ﬂip scattering probability of less than 2%.
For weak spin-ﬂip scattering, the parameter δ mea-
sured in multilayer (m (cid:29) 1) magnetoresistance experi-
ments depends only on the sum of spin-ﬂip transmission
(T↑↓) and reﬂection (Ri↑↓) probabilities. These param-
eters are not related through unitarity, and there is no
reason to assume any speciﬁc relation between them for
a thin interface. In fact, spin transport in circuits con-
taining spin-non-conserving interfaces generally depends
separately on these probabilities. Therefore, the param-
eter δ and the area-resistance product of the interface do

not provide complete information needed for the descrip-
tion of arbitrary magnetoelectronic circuits.

and R(m)↑↓

We also note that the T (m)↑↓

components of
the matrices, which are obtained by concatenating m
identical spin-non-conserving scattering matrices, con-
verge with each other when m becomes large: T (m)↑↓ ≈
R(m)↑↓ ≈ m(T↑↓ + R↑↓). (The latter equality holds as long
as T (m)↑↓ (cid:28) T (m)↑↑ .) For this reason, the resistance and pa-
rameter δ = t/lsf completely describe the behavior of a
suﬃciently thick non-magnetic bulk layer in an arbitrary
circuit, as assumed in the Valet-Fert theory.

d. First-principles calculations. The spin-resolved
transmittances and reﬂectances were calculated using
the Landauer-B¨uttiker approach [14] implemented within
the tight-binding linear muﬃn-tin orbital (TB-LMTO)
method [23]. The discretized representation was used
for the coordinate operator in transport calculations [24],
and SOC was included as a perturbation to the LMTO
potential parameters [25, 26].

We focus on the Cu/Pd interface, for which the ex-
perimental measurements yield a fairly large parameter
δ ≈ 0.24, with relatively narrow error bars [27]. We
consider (111) and (001) interface orientations, with the
spin quantization axis, corresponding to the polarization
of the spin current in a device, aligned either parallel
or perpendicular to the interface. We assume that the
atomic positions lie on the ideal face-centered cubic lat-
tice with a lattice constant a = 3.818 ˚A. In addition to
the ideal interfaces, several simple intermixing models are
considered for the (111) orientation.

Some care needs to be taken to deﬁne the spin-ﬂip
scattering probabilities, bearing in mind that, owing to
the presence of SOC in the bulk, the electronic states in
each spin reservoir are already not pure spin-up and spin-
down spinors. This bulk spin mixing should be separated
from the spin-ﬂip scattering at the interface.

To deﬁne the spin-resolved interfacial transmittance
Tσσ(cid:48) and reﬂectance Ri
σσ(cid:48) (where i = Cu or Pd), we turn
oﬀ SOC in the leads and introduce “ramp-up” regions
where SOC is gradually increased as one moves away
from the embedding planes toward the Cu/Pd interface.
For generic k-points this “adiabatic embedding” allows
pure spin states in the leads to evolve without scattering
into the bulk eigenstates, and the spin-dependent scat-
tering probabilities are thus properly deﬁned [28]. An
exception occurs near the boundaries of the projections
of the Fermi sheets, where the group velocity is nearly
parallel to the interface. Here the deformation of the
Fermi surface by SOC can lead to strong reﬂection.

To examine the eﬀect of adiabatic embedding on the
Pd side, we consider a Pd slab of thickness D, located
at |x| < D/2 and attached to Pd leads without SOC at
|x| > D/2, with the SOC parameters scaled by a function
f (|x|) such that f (0) = 1 and f (D/2) = 0. We used a
simple trapezoidal form of f (x), which is constant over
a few atomic layers near the interface and then declines
linearly to zero; the results are insensitive to the shape of

3

f (x). As long as D is at least a few dozen monolayers in
this test system, T↑↓ is negligible, while R↑↓ is 2–4 times
smaller compared to RPd↑↓ in the Cu/Pd system with a
similar ramp-up region on the Pd side. Fig. 1 shows that
the k-resolved R↑↓ in the test system is indeed signiﬁcant
only near the edges of the Fermi surface projections. As
expected, R↑↓ in the test Pd system quickly saturates as
the width D is increased. Qualitatively, the situation is
analogous to the ballistic scattering from a ferromagnetic
domain wall [29].

FIG. 1. k-resolved spin-ﬂip reﬂectance R↑↓ for the test Pd
system, in which SOC is gradually suppressed away from a
(111) plane. The spin quantization axis points up, parallel to
the interface.

Strong reﬂection near the edges of the Fermi surface
projection persists in the Cu/Pd system with adiabatic
embedding. Since these edges are in no way special for
the scattering from the abrupt Cu/Pd interface, it should
be fully attributed to the reﬂection from the ramp-up re-
gion. Therefore, we subtract R↑↓ for the test Pd system
from RPd↑↓ for the Cu/Pd interface. Since the former is
a few times smaller than the latter, the uncertainties in-
herent in this procedure lead to relatively small errors in
δ compared to the experimental uncertainty.

In addition to ideal (111) and (001) interfaces, we con-
sidered several simple models of roughness with inter-
mixing in one monolayer for the (111) interface, with the
following structures of this monolayer: (A) 1:1 superlat-
tice (50/50 model), (B) 2×2 ordering of Pd atoms within
the Cu monolayer (75/25 model), (C) 2 × 2 ordering of
Cu atoms within the Pd monolayer (25/75 model).

The results are listed in Table I. Here ¯RCu↑↓ /A and
¯RPd↑↓ /A are the speciﬁc spin-ﬂip reﬂectances for Cu with
SOC embedded in Cu without SOC, and for adiabati-
cally embedded Pd with SOC, respectively. The integra-
tion is performed using a mesh of 256 × 256 points in
the full two-dimensional Brillouin zone. For each inter-
face we consider two orientations of the spin quantization
axis, parallel ((cid:107)) and perpendicular (⊥) to the interface,
which reﬂects the orientation of the spin accumulation
In the parallel case we average T↑↓ and
in the device.
Rs↑↓ over two orthogonal in-plane orientations of the spin
quantization axis; we also average over the reversed spin
indices, e.g., T↑↓ and T↓↑, as well T↑↑ and T↓↓. The devi-
ations from axial symmetry are appreciable only for the

allel to the interface. Note the mirror symmetry in the

to Fig. 1, which is due to the adiabatic embedding on the

reﬂection is also seen at generic k-points in Fig. 2(d),
which originates at the Cu/Pd interface.

similar and in reasonable agreement with experiment. In
agreement with Ref. 30, the calculated interface area-
resistance product AR is overestimated by 65-100% and
is not strongly aﬀected by intermixing. Intermixing also
has a relatively small eﬀect on δ, increasing it by a small
amount. Due to the fairly large size mismatch, the struc-
ture of the Cu/Pd multilayer can exhibit signiﬁcant disor-
der and strain relaxation, which may lead to the discrep-
ancy in the area-resistance product. The overestimation
of δ may be due to the same reason.

Table I shows that δ becomes notably larger when the
spin accumulation is oriented perpendicular to the in-
terface. This angular dependence can be tested in ex-
periments on multilayers [5, 6] by utilizing ferromagnetic
layers with perpendicular magnetization.

In conclusion, we have formulated a theory of spin
loss at metallic interfaces, linking the calculable spin-
dependent scattering properties of an interface with the
phenomenological parameter δ measured in experiments
on magnetoresistance in multilayers. This relation [Eq.
(8)] shows that spin-ﬂip scattering on the order of a
few percent yields δ that is comparable to unity. First-
principles calculations for the Cu/Pd interface give δ in
reasonable agreement with experiment, but somewhat
overestimated. Understanding of spin loss at metallic
interfaces is an important ingredient for the analysis of
spin transport in magnetic heterostructures with strong
spin-orbit coupling.

try, the total S matrix also satisﬁes S = ST .

The spin-dependent distribution functions in nodes 1
and 2, as well as the current matrix, can be expressed
via the Pauli matrices ˆσ1, ˆσ2, ˆσ3 and the unit matrix
ˆσ0: ˆf1 = ˆ1f 0
2 , ˆI = (ˆ1I 0 + ˆσ ¯I s)/2.
We express the scattering amplitudes with the help of
notations proposed in Ref.
[17]. Denoting the unit ma-
trix as ˆσ0 and using the Kronecker product ⊗, we de-
ﬁne Rµν

The circuit theory expression (A1) can now be rewrit-
ten in the form of Eqs. (4)-(5) of the main text, with the

It is well known that interface resistances in transpar-
ent Ohmic contacts are renormalized by the Sharvin re-
sistance [21, 22]. The circuit theory can be generalized to
account for the drift contributions in the nodes by renor-
malizing the conductances G, Gt, and Gsl
1(2). This can
be done by connecting nodes 1 and 2 to proper reservoirs
with spin-dependent distribution functions ˆfL and ˆfR via
transparent contacts. The currents in the nodes then be-
come ˆI1 = 2M1( ˆfL − ˆf1) and ˆI2 = 2M2( ˆf2 − ˆfR), where
M1(2) describe the number of channels in the nodes. Sub-
stituting these currents in Eqs. (A4), (A5), and (A6), we
arrive at the amended circuit theory:
