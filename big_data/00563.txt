Abstract

Plasmonics enables deep-subwavelength concentration of light and has become important

for fundamental studies as well as real-life applications. Two major existing platforms of

plasmonics are metallic nanoparticles and metallic ﬁlms. Metallic nanoparticles allow efﬁ-

cient coupling to far ﬁeld radiation, yet their synthesis typically leads to poor material quality.

Metallic ﬁlms offer substantially higher quality materials, but their coupling to radiation is

typically jeopardized due to the large momentum mismatch with free space. Here, we propose

and theoretically investigate optically thin metallic ﬁlms as an ideal platform for high-radiative-

efﬁciency plasmonics. For far-ﬁeld scattering, adding a thin high-quality metallic substrate en-

ables a higher quality factor while maintaining the localization and tunability that the nanopar-

ticle provides. For near-ﬁeld spontaneous emission, a thin metallic substrate, of high quality or

not, greatly improves the ﬁeld overlap between the emitter environment and propagating sur-

face plasmons, enabling high-Purcell (total enhancement > 104), high-quantum-yield (> 50%)

spontaneous emission, even as the gap size vanishes (3∼5 nm). The enhancement has almost

spatially independent efﬁciency and does not suffer from quenching effects that commonly

exist in previous structures.

2

Ohmic loss in metals is the most critical restriction for plasmonics.1 The restriction can be
characterized by the radiative efﬁciency h , deﬁned as the ratio between the radiative decay rate
and the total decay rate, i.e., h = g rad/g tot. Two major existing platforms of plasmonics are metal-
lic nanoparticles2–7 and metallic ﬁlms;8–11 they both face their own restrictions for achieving a
high h . A major problem regarding nanoparticles is their poor material qualities due to the amor-

phous structures that arise from the colloidal synthesis processes. In comparison, single- or poly-

crystalline metallic ﬁlms fabricated via temperature-controlled sputtering or epitaxial growth can

achieve much higher material qualities and much lower material losses, but their coupling to ra-

diation is typically jeopardized due to the large momentum mismatch with free space. When the

two platforms are combined, the radiation of nanoparticles is also at risk of being quenched by
a bulk nearby metallic ﬁlm. These restrictions lead to compromises between h and other mode
properties, such as quality factors (Qs) and mode volumes12–14 (V s).

For plasmonic light scattering, it is often desirable to achieve high radiative efﬁciencies and

high Qs simultaneously. In biomedical sensing,15–18 for example, a high Q is required for high

spectral resolution, while a high radiative efﬁciency (stronger scattering) is needed for high signal-

to-noise ratio (SNR). Meanwhile, transparent displays19–21 based on resonant scattering demand

high Qs for high transparency and high radiative efﬁciencies for high brightness. However, it is
very challenging to achieve both goals at the same time. First, Q, s ext, and s sca are all bounded
from above as functions of the permittivities of materials,22–25 primarily due to the intrinsic mate-

rial loss. Second, there exists a fundamental physical contradiction between the two requirements:

higher radiative efﬁciencies require higher radiative decay rates, which necessarily reduce the total

quality factors.

For plasmon-enhanced emission,26–32 another trade-off exists between achieving high quantum

yield (QY) and large Purcell33 factors, even though both are typically desired. The key to achieving

high spontaneous emission enhancement over a broadband32,34 using plasmonics is to achieve

small V s. However, as V decreases, absorptive decay rates (proportional to V 35) dominate over

radiative decay rates (proportional to V 2 35), triggering a drastic drop in QY.31,36,37 Recently, much

3

effort has been made to enhance spontaneous emission using gap plasmons,28–30,36,38–40 created

via the conﬁnement of light within the dielectric gap between nanoparticles and an optically thick

metallic substrate. Compared with other types of resonances, the gap plasmon resonance achieves

high total enhancement30 as it offers more reliable control of the dielectric gap thinness. However,

these gap plasmon resonances cannot avoid the dilemma between QY and V . For example, when

the gap size is reduced to 5 nm or smaller for a nanocube, despite a higher total decay rate, the

efﬁciency (deﬁned as the sum of photon and plasmon radiative efﬁciency29,30,36) drops below

∼20%.30,36 Moreover, the efﬁciency is strongly dependent on the location of emitters. QY reaches

maximum if the emitter is placed at the center of the gap but decreases immensely when the emitter

is in the proximity of the metal.30

Here, we propose and theoretically demonstrate that an optically thin metallic ﬁlm makes an

ideal platform for high-radiative-efﬁciency plasmonics via two examples: high-Q scattering and

enhanced emission. For scattering, a high-quality thin metallic ﬁlm facilitates a high-Q, high-

radiative-efﬁciency Mie plasmon resonance, whose Q exceeds the quasistatic Q of the nanoparti-

cle material. For enhanced emission, gap plasmons can still be well supported and are better mode

overlapped with external radiation using an optically-thin metallic substrate. A high-Purcell (total

enhancement > 104), spatially-independent-efﬁciency (>50%) spontaneous emission enhancement

can be achieved with vanishing gap size (3∼5 nm), even if the substrate has the same material

properties as the nanoparticles. Our platform can also be extended to other applications (for ex-

ample, nonlinear frequency generation and multiplexing), because of the enhanced efﬁciencies of

high-order plasmonic modes. Moreover, the ratio between photon and plasmon radiation can be

easily tailored by altering the shape of the nanoparticles, making this platform versatile for both

ﬂuorescence29–31 and plasmon circuits.41–44

Below we show that in plasmonic optical scattering, the quasistatic Q of a deep subwavelength

nanoparticles can be exceeded with the help of an optically thin high-quality metal ﬁlm, while
maintaining considerably high radiative efﬁciencies h , which is also known as the scattering quan-
tum yield15 or the albedo45 in scattering problems. For a subwavelength scattering process, based

4

on temporal coupled-mode theory,46,47 the radiative efﬁciency h and the total quality factor Qtot
for a single resonance are given by

h ≡

,

(2)

where w 0 is the resonant frequency, g tot = g rad + g abs is the total decay rate, and s ext = s sca + s abs
is the extinction cross-section. As g abs is mostly dictated by material absorption,22,23 to get a high
h , one has to increase g rad. This in turn spoils the quality factor (Eq. 2), which reveals the trade-
off between h and Qtot, as we described previously. Because simultaneously achieving a high
Q and a high h
is important for many applications, like biomedical sensing15–18 and transparent
displays,19–21 we deﬁne the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) for scattering as

FOMsca =

Qtot
1 − h

.

It follows that this FOM reduces to the quasistatic quality factor Qqs

which only depends on the material property of the nanoparticle. Here, e ′ and e ′′ are real and

imaginary parts of the complex permittivity. For subwavelength metallic nanoparticles (dimension
≪ l ), their plasmon properties are typically dominated by quasistatic considerations22 and thus

the approximation Qabs ≃ Qqs holds, which also indicates that the material loss inside the metallic

nanoparticle cannot be further reduced. Therefore, our strategy is to squeeze parts of the reso-

nant mode into a high-quality metallic ﬁlm 8,9 with much lower loss, while maintaining efﬁcient

radiation rates.

As an example, we investigate a silver torus48–51 scatterer, sitting on top of a TiO2-Ag-TiO2

multiﬁlm, whose structural geometry is shown in Fig. 1(a). The permittivities of the silver ﬁlm and

the torus are obtained from Wu8 and Palik,52 respectively; the former has substantially lower loss

since it is assumed to be made epitaxially. The permittivity of amorphous TiO2 (refractive index
∼ 2.5 in the visible and near-infrared spectra) is from Kim.53 The ambient index of refraction is

1.38 (near the refractive index of water, tissue ﬂuids, and various polymers). If the structure is

probed with normally incident plane waves, only the m = 1 (m is the azimuthal index of the modes

since the structure is axially-symmetric) modes of the structure can be excited.35 Fig. 1(b) shows

the mode proﬁles of the two m = 1 resonances in this structure. Resonance A is a gap plasmon

resonance39 whose ﬁeld is mostly conﬁned in the upper TiO2 layer. Resonance B corresponds to
the torus (Mie) plasmon resonance,54 given that it maintains a nodal line [green dashed line in

Fig. 1(b)] along z = r (r is the minor radius of the torus), which is a feature of the torus resonance
in free space.48–51 Fig. 1(c) and (d) compare s sca and s ext of the torus when the silver layer in the
multiﬁlm is optically thick (t = 30 nm) or thin (t = 3.4 nm). For both resonances, the radiative

efﬁciency in the thin-ﬁlm case is much higher than that in the thick-ﬁlm case. Moreover, when

the torus moves away from the multiﬁlm, the response of resonances is very different for the thin

ﬁlm case from that for the thick ﬁlm, as shown in Fig.S1. We now focus on the Mie resonance

B for high-Q scattering as most of its entire radiation (photon and plasmon combined) goes into

the far ﬁeld (photon). We will return to the gap plasmon resonance A later for enhanced emission

applications.

By changing t from 0 nm to 50 nm while keeping other parameters unchanged (t = 0 nm

corresponds to a single 25-nm TiO2 layer), we are able to track the torus plasmon resonance B

and evaluate its FOMsca, as shown in Fig. 2. As t increases, the resonance blueshifts, along with

a reduced linewidth [Fig. 2(a)].

In Fig. 2(b), we compare the FOMsca in our structure to the
quasistatic limit Qqs for different materials in the system: Palik silver52 for the torus and epitaxial
silver for the substrate8 (FOMsca and Qqs are directly comparable, see Eqs. 3 and 4). There exists

a plateau of higher FOMsca at t = 3 ∼ 10 nm. At these thicknesses, the multiﬁlm still has very high

transmission > 80% (Fig.S2). The FOMsca of the torus plasmon resonance exceeds and becomes
twice as high as the Qqs of the torus material (Palik52). When the silver layer is either too thin (< 3

Figure 2: (a) The scattering cross section s sca of torus plasmon resonance decreases as the silver
ﬁlm thickness t increases. (b) FOMsca = Qtot/(1 − h ) ≃ Qqs shows that our structure can exceed
the quasistatic limits for the Palik silver used in the nanoparticle. When the silver ﬁlm is optically
thin (t = 3 ∼ 10 nm), a plateau of FOMsca ∼40 exceeding quasistatic limit of the Palik silver is
achieved for resonant wavelengths at 600∼800 nm, as denoted by the dashed green lines.

nm) or too thick (> 20 nm), the FOMsca becomes lower than the Qqs of the torus material. Fig. 2(c)

shows that the high FOMsca can be maintained for both polarizations over a wide range of incident

angles.

The aforementioned enhanced Q is different from the linewidth narrowing that is based on the

interference between multiple resonances.2 For coupled resonances, as the trace of the full Hamil-

tonian is conserved, the linewidth reduction of one resonance necessarily implies the broadening

of the others’. This coupling also typically renders the spectrum Fano-like with dark states in

the middle of the spectrum.55 In contrast, here the linewidth reduction is realized via effectively

squeezing a single Mie plasmon mode into an optically-thin metallic ﬁlm. Scattering spectrum is

kept single-Lorentzian, which is favorable for many applications16–19,21 as it maintains a high res-

olution and SNR. Moreover, as the resonance for scattering uses the Mie plasmon and the ambient

environment is the perturbed free space, most of the reradiated energy goes into the far ﬁeld with

weak plasmon excitation (see supporting information). We also note that optically thin metallic

ﬁlms are not restricted to high-Q applications shown above. Applications based on broadband

strong scattering (like solar cells requiring longer optical path) can also be implemented on this

platform, utilizing its high radiative efﬁciency.

Antennas work equally well as receivers and as transmitters; in the context of nanoparticles,

the radiative efﬁciency h

is equally important, whether nanoparticles are used to scatter light from

the far ﬁeld or serve as external cavities to enhance spontaneous emission in the near ﬁeld. The
quantum yield (QY) of an emitter (whose total decay rate is G 0 in free space) enhanced by a
plasmonic nanoparticle can be approximated as32 QY ≃ h

decay rate is dominated by the plasmonic resonance (note we use G and g to denote the emission
and scattering processes respectively). Here, G

Recently, gap plasmons28–30,36,38–40 show their advantage in spontaneous emission enhance-

ment for the corresponding more reliable control of the dielectric gap thinness. An optically

thick metallic substrate is commonly used in previous reports,28–30,36,40,56,57 in order to obtain

the highly-conﬁned metal-insulator-metal (MIM) SPP within the dielectric gap. However, the

thick ﬁlm also induces large mode absorption and spatially dependent low efﬁciency, when the

dielectric gap vanishes.

To begin with, we show why optically thin metallic substrates can facilitate high-Purcell and

high radiative-efﬁciency plasmonics via a mode-overlap analysis. Film-coupled nanoparticles can

be understood as Fabry-Perot cavities58–60 of gap plasmons, with two radiative channels: one into

propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), and another into photons via adiabatic tapering

effect54,61,62 using nanoparticle edges. Fig. 3(a) shows the conventionally used metal-insulator-

metal (MIM) SPP for emission enhancement. If we reduce the thickness of metal substrate so

that it is smaller than the skin depth of MIM SPP, the lower dielectric half space starts to have

a decaying tail. We call this new type of SPP the metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) SPP

[Fig. 3(b)]. Surprisingly, although we use less metal, the MIMI SPP achieves better light conﬁne-
/¶ k) than the MIM SPP given the same frequency, as shown in the dispersion
ment (smaller ¶w

diagram [Fig. 3(c)]. This indicates that the on-resonance local density of states of the MIMI SPP

will be higher than that of the MIM SPP, if one replaces the top metal layer with a nanoparticle as

a frequency-selecting cavity. A better mode overlap61,63 (middle of Fig. 3(a)(b) and see Supple-

mentary Information) between the gap plasmon with the corresponding propagating SPP implies

a larger radiative decay rate into propagating SPP than that in the case using an optically thick

ﬁlm. Fig. 3(d) shows that the MIMI-IMI overlap is much larger than the MIM-IM overlap over a

wide wavelength range, from near infrared to the entire visible spectrum. On the other hand, as the

thickness of the metallic substrate becomes much smaller than the mean free path of electrons in

silver (∼50 nm at room temperature64,65), mode absorption within the metallic ﬁlm can be greatly

suppressed. Note that although the above analysis only discusses the mode matching between gap

and propagating SPPs, the photon decay rate can be greatly enhanced via tapering the SPPs into

11

photons using the momenta provided by nanoparticle edges, which we will show later.

the dielectric gap. The white arrow denotes a z-polarized dipole emitter and the red solid box
deﬁnes the sweeping area of the dipole location. Orange dashed lines outline the interfaces between
different layers.
(c) Radiative enhancement and (d) radiative efﬁciency in the x − z plane as a

of radiative enhancement (upper) and efﬁciency (lower) as a function of dielectric gap size g, with
a thin (t = 10 nm) and thick (t = 50 nm) silver substrate. The green arrow indicates the increase
of efﬁciency by decreasing substrate thickness. The size of the cylinder changes accordingly with
different g to maintain the resonance at ∼700 nm. The dipole stays at the center of the gap, and
under the edge of the cylinder.

Next, we move from the analytical modal analysis to rigorous computations of the enhanced

emission characteristics for realistic structures. We consider a structure with a silver cylinder

on top of a silver thin ﬁlm [Fig. 4(a)]. The permittivities of the cylinder and the ﬁlm are both

Palik silver52 to offer a worst-case scenario analysis. For this structure, the radiative (photon
+ plasmon) efﬁciency h
is calculated to be h ∼60% and h ∼30% for t = 10 and t = 50 nm

respectively using the scattering and extinction cross-sections of the cylinder, as shown in Fig.S3.

As the electric ﬁeld is dominated by Ez, a z-polarized dipole (marked by the white arrow) is placed

12

within the gap to probe the enhancement [Fig. 4(b)]. A sweeping analysis of dipole location in

the x − z plane (marked by the solid red box) provides all the information about the enhancement

due to the rotational symmetry of the structure. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the radiative decay rate
rad/G 0 is generally higher with the thin ﬁlm (t = 10 nm) than that with the thick ﬁlm (t = 50
nm). More surprisingly, h
in the t = 10 nm case remains almost uniformly high in the x − z

plane with an average of ∼60%, while that in the t = 50 case drops to ∼30% (Fig. 4(d). Both

results are consistent with their scattering-extinction ratio (Fig.S3). Note that in the t = 10 nm
rad/G 0 remains high even for dipole locations within 1-nm distance from the metal surface,
case, G
where absorption is always considered dominant.26,30,31 If epitaxial silver is used for the metal
substrate, similar results are obtained with even higher h , as shown in Fig.S4. Fig. 4(e) compares
rad/G 0 and h as a function of dielectric gap size for t = 10 and t = 50 nm cases, with a ﬁxed
emitter at the center of the gap, and under the edge of the cylinder. The trends of G
rad/G 0 are
similar. For h , in the t = 10 nm case it remains higher for all gap sizes. The advantage becomes

more striking with vanishing gap size (3∼8 nm), where the thin substrate achieves a much higher

enhancement and efﬁciency simultaneously.

The optically thin metallic susbstrates have two main advantages compared to the thick ones.
First, the cavity mode becomes less absorptive as shown by the loss per volume (smaller G abs, see
Fig.S3). Second, the radiative decay rate is enhanced (larger G
rad) because of the improved mode

overlap condition (Fig. 3). We also note that the dielectric gap and the metal ﬁlm discussed in the

structure are optically thin, yet not atomically thin. Hence, the local response approximation is still

valid in the above analysis, as the nonlocal effects are typically insigniﬁcant with geometrical sizes
larger than 1 nm 66 (or > l p/100,67 l p is the plasma wavelength) in this gap plasmon resonance.
As there are two radiative channels in the gap plasmon structure (i.e., free space radiation into
far and SPP excitation G SPP), it is important to separate the total radiative decay rate
rad into the two channels (see supporting information) and know how to tailor their relative ra-

the far ﬁeld G

tio. It has been shown that tapered antennas (particles like spheres and tori) have higher radiative

efﬁciencies than rigid antennas (particles like cubes and cylinders).36 Here we show the ratio of

azimuthal-index, m) modes, which are typically less efﬁcient in plasmonics. Emission enhance-
ment and radiative efﬁciency of the torus-multiﬁlm structure (R = 28 nm, r = 24 nm, and t = 5

Normalized electric ﬁeld of the gap plasmon resonance of the torus with illustrated major decay-

the z-polarized dipole. Green dash lines denote the interfaces of different layers. (b) Radiation into
surface plasmons can be converted to radiation in the far ﬁeld by altering the nanoparticle shape,
e.g., from a cylinder to a torus. The key to the large total (G
far +G SPP) radiative emission, in either
case, is the use of a thin-ﬁlm metallic substrate.

far and G SPP in the entire radiation can be tailored via the shape of nanoparticles. We replace
the cylinder with a torus, as shown in Fig. 5. There are multiple orders of gap plasmon reso-

nances (whispering gallery modes with the dielectric gap) in this structure. Usually the decay of

high-order resonances of a plasmonic nanoantenna is dominated by absorption and thus are not

very efﬁcient for excitation or radiation. However, with a thin metal substrate, the ﬁrst three gap

plasmon resonances of the structure (denoted by their azimuthal index m) all achieve consider-

ably high enhancement, while maintaining high efﬁciencies [Fig. 5(a)]. This result reveals the
potential for high-efﬁciency harmonic generation and wave multiplexing. For the cylinder, G SPP
is the dominant radiative channel [Fig. 5(c) left], making this structure an ideal candidate for a
high excitation-efﬁciency plasmon source.41–44 While for the torus, G
is useful for ﬂuorescence applications29–31 [Fig. 5(c) right]. Note that although the photon and

far is greatly boosted, which

plasmon excitation ratio is different in the two nanoparticles, it is the thin metallic substrate that

gives rise to the high total radiative enhancement.

The aforementioned high-Q scattering and high-QY emission are deeply connected via the ra-
diative efﬁciency h but differ from each other. For scattering, FOMsca = Q/(1 −h ). For plasmon-
h /V . Thus, two applications focus on Q and V respectively. What
enhanced emission, FOMemit (cid:181)
they need in common is a higher h

for either stronger scattering or higher quantum yield. An-

other difference is that a high-quality metallic substrate is not essential for high-efﬁciency (>50%)

emission (compare Fig. 4(c)(d) with Fig.S4), as the improved mode matching does not rely on

low-absoprtion materials. Nevertheless, it is necessary if one intends to exceed the Qqs of the

nanoparticle material by using the thin metallic substrate (see Fig. 2).

In this letter, we show that optically thin metallic ﬁlms offer an ideal platform for high-

radiative-efﬁciency plasmonics. Using a thin metallic substrate, we achieve high-Q and strong

scattering that exceeds the quasistatic limit of the nanoparticle material. Based on the improved

mode matching condition, we predicted large-Purcell (Fp > 104) and high-efﬁciency (>50%) for

gap-plasmon-enhanced spontaneous emission, maintained over the whole active region. Future

efforts can be made on particle designs that enable accurate and high dynamic-range control of the

15

plasmon and photon excitation. It will also be interesting to study how resonances interfere55,68,69

with each other on this platform.

A. Numerical methods

Mode proﬁles and eigenfrequencies are obtained using ﬁnite-element simulations provided by

COMSOL. The 2D axial symmetric computational cell contains the torus/cylinder scatterer and

the multiﬁlm underneath. Perfectly matched layers are placed in all (r, z) directions and are far

enough from the scatterer to emulate homogeneous ambient space. Eigenfrequency analysis is

used to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenmodes.

Scattering and absorption cross-sections are obtained using the 3D total-ﬁeld-scattered-ﬁeld

(TFSF) simulation in Lumerical. A TFSF plane wave source is placed around the scatterer. A sur-

face integral on the Poynting vector surrounding the scatterer is calculated to extract the scattering

cross-section. A volume integral on the loss per volume inside the scatterer is calculated to extract

the absoprtion cross-section.

Spontaneous emission simulation is also implemented via Lumerical. A dipole source is placed

at various locations in the active layer. Surfaces integrals of the Poynting vectors surrounding the

dipole source and surrounding the nanoantenna are calculated to obtain the total and radiative

(photon + plasmon) decay rates, respectively. The absorption decay rate is their difference. We

note that the calculation of enhancement is implemented via directly probing the local density of

states from a local dipole. The method does not rely on any low-loss or single-mode approximation.

B. Mode overlap

The normalization condition is

Z e E2d3r = 1,

given the modes are non-Hermitian. The overlap of two modes r

is calculated as61

r =

k ˆz ·R (E1 × H2 + E2 × H1)d3r k2

k ˆz ·R E1 × H1d3r k · k ˆz ·R E2 × H2d3r k

,

(S1)

(S2)

where ˆz is the direction of propagation.

Here we adopt the unconjugated cross product because of the non-Hermiticity, although the

conjugated product will also work in this case, since the relevant ﬁeld components are mostly real.
We note that r also has alternate deﬁnitions.63 Both deﬁnitions produce the same curves shown in

Fig.3.

and B denote the gap and torus plasmon resonances of the composite structure, respectively. F
denotes the Mie resonance of the torus in free space. When the torus is far away from the ﬁlm, the
near ﬁeld interaction between the two is weak. As shown from the right of (b) and (c), both the
thin-ﬁlm and thick-ﬁlm case demonstrate the Mie plasmon resonance as in free space, denoted by
F. When the torus approaches the metallic multiﬁlm, however, the evolution of s sca becomes very
different. For the thin-ﬁlm case, F converges to B with a stable resonant wavelength and narrowed
linewidth. For the thick-ﬁlm case, F converges to A with redshifting resonant wavelength and
decreasing s sca.

with a six-fold enhancement of absorption for the t = 50 case. Correspondingly, the radiative efﬁ-
ciency h drops by half. The efﬁciency contrast is also implied from the absorption per unit volume,
which is greatly reduced inside the ﬁlm as well as inside the cylinder by reducing the thickness of
the metallic layer.
