We formulate and apply a low-energy transport theory for hybrid quantum devices containing
junctions of topological superconductor (TS) wires and conventional normal (N) or superconducting
(S) leads. We model TS wires as spinless p-wave superconductors and derive their boundary Keldysh
Green’s function, capturing both the Majorana end state and continuum quasiparticle excitations
in a uniﬁed manner. We also specify this Green’s function for a ﬁnite-length TS wire. Junctions
connecting diﬀerent parts of the device are described by the standard tunneling Hamiltonian. Using
this Hamiltonian approach, one also has the option to include many-body interactions in a systematic
manner. We apply the formalism to N-TS, TS-TS and S-TS junctions, where we report several new
and mostly analytical results for the electrical current and for quantum noise.

INTRODUCTION

for recent reviews, see Refs.

The physics of topological superconductor (TS) wires,
is
featuring Majorana bound states at their ends,
presently attracting a lot of attention in condensed mat-
ter physics, quantum information science, and related
ﬁelds;
[1–5]. Much of
this excitement has been fueled by the tremendous ex-
perimental progress achieved over the past few years.
Strong evidence for Majorana fermions has been reported
from transport experiments using topological nanowires
proximitized by conventional superconductors [6–9] and
from scanning tunneling microscopy of magnetic atom
chains on superconducting substrates [10, 11]. Apart
from demonstrating the non-Abelian Majorana braiding
statistics, a central goal for future experiments is to thor-
oughly understand quantum transport in multiterminal
hybrid devices containing junctions of TS wires and topo-
logically trivial normal (N) or superconducting (S) ma-
terials.

Problems of this type call for a general and versa-
tile theoretical description capable of treating nonequi-
librium transport in such novel devices. One possibility
is given by the well-known scattering approach [12, 13],
which has been successfully applied to noninteracting
devices containing TS wires [1–5]. We here adapt the
Hamiltonian approach [14], which provides a useful al-
ternative by employing nonequilibrium Green’s functions
(GFs), to superconducting hybrid systems containing TS
wires. This approach starts from uncoupled GFs describ-
ing the separate parts of the device, which are then cou-
pled together by tunneling processes. In a noninteracting
setting, by solving the Dyson equation, tunnel couplings
are taken into account in an exact manner. In addition,
by using diagrammatic expansions or related techniques,
one can also include many-body interactions. To give
just a few examples for successful non-topological ap-
plications of the Hamiltonian approach, let us mention

S-QD-S [15, 16] and N-QD-S [17] junctions containing
an interacting quantum dot (QD) sandwiched between
S and/or N contacts, extensions to diﬀusive and/or fer-
romagnetic systems [18], Coulomb blockade in voltage-
biased superconducting quantum point contacts [19, 20],
multiterminal hybrid structures [21], and junctions of
unconventional superconductors [22–24]. For Majorana
wires, similar calculations have been used to describe sub-
gap transport from eﬀective low-energy models that only
retain the Majorana sector, see, e.g., Refs. [25–27].

We here derive an explicit and simple expression for the
GF describing the boundary of a TS wire, see Eqs. (1)
and (6) below, which captures the Majorana state as
well as continuum quasiparticles in a uniﬁed manner,
and thereby allows for systematic theoretical studies of
nonequilibrium transport in topological hybrid devices.
We study both subgap and above-gap transport, where
detailed and mostly analytical expressions are reported
below. As concrete examples for this approach, we shall
here focus on the simplest case given by tunnel junc-
tions. In particular, we discuss the physics of N-TS, TS-
TS, and S-TS tunnel junctions involving TS wires with
broken time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries. This
“class D” case is most relevant for present experiments
[6–9] and corresponds to a spinless p-wave superconduc-
tor at energies close to the Fermi level [28].
In more
reﬁned descriptions, one could also include high-energy
bandstructure eﬀects, see Ref. [29], order parameter self-
consistency, and/or models capturing the phase transi-
tion to the non-topological phase. However, analytical
results are then generally harder to obtain. Our theory
below allows for arbitrary junction transmission prob-
ability τ (deﬁned for the corresponding N-N junction),
bias voltage V , and temperature T .

Let us now brieﬂy describe the main results and the
structure of this paper. In Sec. II, we present the model
and the GF formalism used in this work. We present the
boundary GF both for a semi-inﬁnite and for a ﬁnite-

length TS wire in Sec. II A. In Sec. II B, we introduce
the tunneling Hamiltonian, followed by the calculation of
transport observables in Sec. II C. In Sec. III, we study
transport through a voltage-biased N-TS junction. The
current-voltage relation can be expressed in terms of a
spectral current density J(ω), which follows in surpris-
ingly simple form for arbitrary junction transparency τ,
see Sec. III A. For ω = eV , this spectral density directly
yields the T = 0 diﬀerential conductance. We thereby re-
produce and simplify previous results for the diﬀerential
conductance [23, 25, 30–32]. Furthermore, we address the
zero-frequency shot noise power in the N-TS junction for
voltages below and above the gap, see Sec. III B, where
in the subgap regime, we recover the results of Refs. [33–
35] where applicable. In Sec. IV, we shall discuss TS-TS
junctions. The well-known Josephson eﬀect for this case
[28, 36, 37] is brieﬂy discussed within our GF scheme
in Sec. IV A. In Sec. IV B, we present analytical expres-
sions for the equilibrium ﬁnite-frequency noise spectrum,
thereby extending the results of Refs. [38, 39]. More-
over, in Sec. IV C, we study the nonequilibrium multiple
Andreev reﬂection (MAR) features in the time-averaged
current-voltage (I-V ) characteristics, cf. Refs. [40–42],
where we shall provide an analytical solution valid in the
low-bias regime. In Sec. V, we study S-TS junctions be-
tween a conventional (with gap ∆s) and a topological
(with gap ∆) superconductor. Taking into account only
spin-conserving tunneling processes, in Sec. V A, we con-
ﬁrm the prediction of a vanishing equilibrium Josephson
current [43]. When spin-ﬂip tunneling events are impor-
tant, however, a Josephson current is expected to ﬂow
[44].
In Sec. V B, we discuss the diﬀerential conduc-
tance, where we reproduce and extend the recent pre-
diction [45] of a universal diﬀerential conductance peak
of height GM = (4 − π)[2e2/h] at eV = ∆s. We ﬁnally
oﬀer some conclusions in Sec. VI. Details of our calcu-
lations can be found in three appendices, and we often
employ units with e =  = kB = vF = 1, where vF is the
Fermi velocity.

II. HAMILTONIAN APPROACH

A. Green’s function formalism

A quantity of central interest for the approach used
below is the Keldysh Green’s function (GF) ˇG, which
is deﬁned for the entire system composed of several
tunnel-coupled (super-)conductors. This GF aﬀords a
matrix representation on the tensor product of
four
diﬀerent spaces:
(i) Keldysh space, referring to the
forward/backward parts (α = +/−) of the Keldysh
time contour needed to properly describe nonequilibrium
transport processes, (ii) Nambu space encoding the par-
ticle/hole structure of the theory, (iii) the space labeling
diﬀerent conductors, e.g., the left/right parts (j = 1, 2)
of a single tunnel junction, and (iv) time (or frequency)
space. The structure of ˇG in Keldysh space, with matrix

2

elements Gαα(cid:48), can be fully expressed in terms of the
retarded (GR), advanced (GA), and Keldysh (GK) GF
components [13],

with the Keldysh matrix ˇL = 1√
2

We shall describe the system as built from decoupled
pieces that are connected by a tunneling Hamiltonian,
cf. Ref. [14]. In such an approach, one ﬁrst determines
the “uncoupled” GF ˇg in the absence of tunnel couplings,
which is diagonal in lead space, ˇgjj(cid:48) = δjj(cid:48) ˇgj. We shall
specify ˇgj below for a TS wire (j = T S), for a normal con-
ductor (j = N), and for a topologically trivial s-wave su-
perconductor (j = S). In all three cases, it is convenient
to use the frequency representation, ˇgj = ˇgj(ω). The
Keldysh component gK
j (ω), see Eq. (1), is expressed by
the retarded/advanced components in a standard manner
via the “local equilibrium” relation [13],
j (ω) − gA

j (ω) = f (ω)(cid:0)gR

j (ω)(cid:1) ,

(2)

gK

where the distribution function

(3)

f (ω) = 1 − 2nF (ω) = tanh(ω/2T )
is connected to the Fermi function nF (ω).
In a gauge
(termed “gauge I” in what follows) commonly used in the
description of normal-conducting systems, tunnel cou-
plings are represented by time-independent matrix ele-
ments and one has to take into account the respective
chemical potential µj in Eq. (2), see below for details. As
is customary for superconducting systems, in Eq. (2) we
have instead assumed a diﬀerent “gauge II,” where chem-
ical potential diﬀerences appear through time-dependent
phases in the tunnel couplings, cf. Eq. (14) below. In any
case, once the ˇgj are known, in a second step the full GF
ˇG is obtained by nonperturbatively taking into account
tunneling processes via the Dyson equation, see Eq. (22)
below. From the knowledge of the full GF, all transport
quantities of interest can subsequently be determined.

We begin with the case of a semi-inﬁnite TS wire lo-
cated at x > 0, corresponding to lead index j = T S.
We shall determine the Keldysh GF ˇgT S(ω) for elec-
trons/holes near the boundary at x = 0. The TS
nanowire is described as spinless single-channel p-wave
superconductor, corresponding to the low-energy limit of
a Kitaev chain [1, 2, 28], cf. Appendix A. The Hamilto-
nian reads

(4)

ˆ ∞

HT S =

where the proximity-induced pairing gap ∆ can be chosen
†
real positive. The Nambu spinor ΨT S(x) = (cr, c
l )T in
Eq. (4) contains right- and left-moving fermion operators
cr,l(x), and the Pauli matrices σx,y,z and σ0 = diag(1, 1)
act in Nambu (particle-hole) space. Corrections beyond

the “universal” low-energy limit in Eq. (4) may be signiﬁ-
cant for realistic TS wires [46]. However, such corrections
are often small, consistent with the topological “protec-
tion” of the TS phase, and they permit a perturbative
treatment if necessary. We will not discuss such correc-
tions, since a decisive advantage of the universal GF, see
Eq. (6) below, comes from its simplicity and the possi-
bility of obtaining analytical results.

The boundary GF ˇgT S(ω) can be computed by taking
the wide-band limit for a semi-inﬁnite Kitaev chain, or
directly by starting from the low-energy Hamiltonian (4).
We provide a derivation along the ﬁrst route in App. A,
but one can check that the same result also follows from
the second approach. The GF is deﬁned as the Fourier
transform of

ˇgT S(t − t(cid:48)) = −i(cid:104)TCΨ(t)Ψ†(t(cid:48))(cid:105),

(5)
where the boundary Nambu spinor is Ψ = (c, c†)T with
c = [cl + cr](x → 0), and TC denotes the Keldysh time-
ordering prescription [13]. We note in passing that the
relation Ψ = σxΨ∗ (with “∗” denoting complex conjuga-
tion) imposes a reality constraint on this spinor. Using
Eqs. (1) and (2), ˇgT S(ω) is fully determined by specifying
the Nambu representation of the retarded/advanced GF
components, cf. App. A,

we shall omit the R/A superscripts whenever the context
permits.

Equation (8) features the celebrated Majorana zero-
energy peak due to the ω = 0 pole of the retarded GF
in Eq. (6). In addition, for |ω| > ∆, a continuum quasi-
particle contribution is present that vanishes as a square
root for |ω| → ∆, unlike the conventional BCS singular-
ity, cf. Eq. (13) below. The Nambu structure of these two
contributions in Eq. (8) is diﬀerent and highlights the fact
that the Majorana state represents an equal-probability
electron-hole superposition state.

We have assumed up to now that the wire is located at
x > 0, where ˇgT S = ˇgT S,x>0 is evaluated near x = 0. For
a wire on the opposite side (x < 0), the corresponding
boundary GF near x = 0, ˇgT S,x<0, follows from Eq. (6)
by spatial inversion. In eﬀect, due to the p-wave char-
acter of the superconducting pairing, we need to reverse
the sign of ∆ in Eq. (6), leading to

ˇgT S,x<0 = σy ˇgT S,x>0σy.

Before we specify the corresponding expressions for
let us
topologically trivial systems (with j = N, S),
brieﬂy address the eﬀect of a ﬁnite TS wire length L on
the GF. In that case, by repeating the analysis in App. A
for a ﬁnite-length Kitaev chain with −L/2 ≤ x ≤ L/2,
we obtain the retarded/advanced GF near x = ±L/2 as
(ζωσ0 ∓ tanh(ζωL)∆σx) , (10)

ω2 − 2
∆2 − ω2 and ω = ∆/ cosh(ζωL). Let us
where ζω =
show how Eq. (10) reduces to Eq. (6) in the limit L → ∞.
For the subgap part, this is seen in a straightforward
manner, but for the continuum spectrum (|ω| > ∆), one
needs to take into account a ﬁnite quasiparticle relaxation
time τqp, such that the inﬁnitesimal 0+ shift into the com-
plex ω-plane is eﬀectively replaced by 1/τqp. Only then
Re(ζω) is ﬁnite and one has limL→∞ tanh(ζωL) = 1 for
frequencies in the continuum part of the spectrum. We
note in passing that Eq. (10) is also consistent with the
spatial inversion rule in Eq. (9). On low energy scales,
|ω| (cid:28) ∆, and assuming a long wire with L > ξ0, where
ξ0 = vF /∆ is the superconducting coherence length, we
conclude that the main ﬁnite-L eﬀect in Eq. (10) is to
introduce the hybridization energy scale ω (cid:39) 2∆e−L/ξ0.
This scale describes the exponentially small coupling be-
tween the two Majorana end states of a ﬁnite-length TS
wire. For |ω| > ∆, on the other hand, ζω becomes imag-
inary and ω slowly oscillates with L.
In addition, we
note that for ﬁnite L, the oﬀ-diagonal (anomalous) part
of the GF in Eq. (10) is suppressed by the last tanh(ζωL)
factor.

Consistent with the low-energy TS description, we
shall employ the wide-band approximation also in de-
scribing topologically trivial systems.
In this standard
approximation, the normal density of states is assumed
constant near the Fermi level [13]. For a normal metal
(j = N), the N-TS tunnel coupling eﬀectively involves
only one spin component in the normal conductor [25],
and therefore ˇgN follows from Eq. (6) by letting ∆ → 0,
(11)

N (ω) = ∓iσ0.
gR/A

The corresponding DOS, νN (ω), is constant.

For a conventional s-wave superconductor (j = S) with
real positive gap ∆s, the retarded/advanced GF is given
by [14, 24, 47],

(cid:112)∆2

gS(ω) = − ωσ0 + ∆sσx

(12)

resulting in the familiar DOS of a BCS superconductor.
The latter is proportional to

In that case, Nambu spinors of the boundary ﬁelds are

deﬁned as ΨS = (c↑, c
erator cσ = cl,σ + cr,σ is given by the sum of the left- and
right-moving components.

B. Tunneling Hamiltonian

We now include the tunneling Hamiltonian HT con-
necting diﬀerent conductors. For the moment, we shall
employ gauge II, cf. Sec. II A, where chemical potential
diﬀerences enter through time-dependent phase factors
in HT .

Let us start with a single tunnel junction, leaving aside
the j = S case discussed later on. Using operators cj=1,2
for electrons close to the left/right side of the junction,
the standard tunneling Hamiltonian reads

†
HT (t) = λeiφ(t)/2c
1c2 + h.c.

(14)

Without loss of generality, the hopping amplitude λ is
assumed real-valued. The normal transmission probabil-
ity τ of the junction (with 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1) is then given by
[13, 14]

τ = 4λ2/(1 + λ2)2.

(15)
An applied d.c. bias voltage, eV = µ1 − µ2, appears here
through the phase diﬀerence

φ(t) = [φ1 − φ2](t) = φ0 + 2eV t/.

(16)

In the equilibrium case (V = 0), only the static phase φ0
is present.

It is convenient to express Eq. (14) in Nambu repre-
sentation, where we also generalize the formalism to an
arbitrary number M of conductors, j = 1, . . . , M. For
that purpose, we ﬁrst deﬁne the time-dependent tunnel-
ing matrix W (t). In lead space, all diagonal elements of
W vanish, Wjj = 0, while the oﬀ-diagonal elements are
given by the Nambu matrices (here, j < j(cid:48))
Wjj(cid:48)(t) = λjj(cid:48)σzeiσz[φj (t)−φj(cid:48) (t)]/2, Wj(cid:48)j(t) = W
(cid:19)

The tunneling Hamiltonian then follows in the form

†
jj(cid:48)(t).

HT (t) = λeiφ(t)/2[cos(θ)c

We now discuss how to describe S-TS junctions,
putting for simplicity M = 2. The Nambu spinor on
the left (j = S) BCS superconducting side is Ψ1 =
†
1,↓)T , and in the absence of spin-ﬂip tunneling, HT
(c1,↑, c
is given in general form as
†
†
1,↑ + e−iχ sin(θ)c
1,↓]c2 + h.c.,
(20)
with two additional real-valued parameters χ and θ on
top of the gauge-invariant phase diﬀerence φ(t). The
junction transparency is again expressed in terms of
λ by Eq. (15). Performing the gauge transformation
c1,σ → eiσχ/2c1,σ with σ =↑ / ↓= +/−, the phase χ can
be absorbed by renormalizing the static phase diﬀerence
φ0 → φ0 + χ in Eq. (16). We can therefore put χ = 0
in what follows.
In addition, by exploiting the SU(2)
spin symmetry of the s-wave BCS superconductor, we
may also put θ = 0, again without loss of generality [48].
Written in Nambu notation, HT is then as in Eq. (18),
where instead of Eq. (17), W (t) has the non-zero Nambu
matrix element

W12(t) = λeiφ(t)/2Π↑, Π↑ =

σ0 + σz

2

,

(21)

†
with W21(t) = W
12(t). In this basis, due to the presence
of the projection operator Π↑ in Eq. (21), only spin-↑
electrons in the BCS superconductor are tunnel-coupled
to the eﬀectively spinless fermions on the j = T S side.
Such a spin-ﬁltered tunnel coupling is generic for junc-
tions without spin-ﬂip tunneling. For example, if the
junction contains magnetic impurities, this property will
be lost and the theory has to be modiﬁed.

C. Transport observables

In the absence of many-body interactions, by using the
equations of motion for Heisenberg operators, we obtain
the “full” Keldysh GF as solution of the Dyson equation

ˇG =(cid:0)ˇg−1 − ˇW(cid:1)−1

,

(22)
with the Keldysh matrix ˇW = diag(W,−W ). From this
solution, all nonequilibrium transport quantities of inter-
est can be deduced as described next. In addition, many-
body interactions can be included by well-established
perturbative/diagrammatic techniques [13].

Let us ﬁrst discuss the mean current ﬂowing through
the jth lead, Ij(t), which in general will be time-
dependent. Taking the expectation value of the current
operator (19), Ij is expressed in terms of the Keldysh GF
component (GK) at coinciding times,

(cid:88)

conservation dictates the condition(cid:80)

Ij(t) =

where the trace “trN” is over Nambu space, and current
j Ij(t) = 0. In or-
der to evaluate GK, we now employ Eqs. (2) and (22).

j(cid:48)j(t, t)(cid:1) ,

(23)

For arbitrary gauge, we ﬁnd

GK = GRF − F GA + GR(F W − W F )GA,

(24)

where matrix products correspond to convolutions and
Fjj(cid:48) = δjj(cid:48)Fj contains the distribution functions in the
absence of tunneling. Explicitly, in gauge II, Fj(ω) =
f (ω)σ0 with f (ω) in Eq. (3). In gauge I, on the other
hand,
for time-independent chemical potential and a

normal-conducting system, one ﬁnds

(cid:18) f (ω − µj)

Fj(ω) =

which can be rationalized by noting that the upper
(lower) entry describes electrons (holes).

Next, we turn to the current-current correlation func-

tion (“noise”),

(cid:68)

(cid:69)

δ ˆIj(t)δ ˆIj(cid:48)(t(cid:48))

δ ˆIj(t) = ˆIj(t) − Ij(t),
(26)
which can similarly be expressed in terms of the full
GF. Using the Keldysh GF components G+− and G−+,
cf. Eq. (1), these noise correlations follow as

,

Sjj(cid:48)(t, t(cid:48)) =

To give a ﬁrst example for the above expressions, the
time-averaged current-voltage characteristics of a tun-
nel junction (M = 2) between an arbitrary pair of
the above systems follows at low transparency, τ (cid:28) 1,
from a lowest-order perturbative solution of the Dyson
equation (22). Equation (23) thereby yields the current
I = I1 = −I2 as
ˆ

dω ν1(ω)ν2(ω − eV ) [f (ω) − f (ω − eV )] ,
(28)
with the energy-dependent DOS ν1,2(ω) on the respective
side, and f (ω) in Eq. (3).

III. N-TS JUNCTION

In this section, we shall study a tunnel junction be-
tween a normal conductor (j = 1) and a TS wire (j = 2).
Going beyond Eq. (28), we consider the case of arbitrary
junction transparency 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1. For an N-TS junction
at constant bias voltage, eV = µ1 − µ2, it is convenient
to adopt gauge I with time-independent tunneling matrix
W12 = λσz.

approaches the Ohmic conductance τ e2/h expected for a
normal-conducting spinless tunnel junction in the classi-
cal regime. These results are illustrated in the left panel
of Fig. 1.

Before turning to a discussion of current-current cor-
relations, we note in passing that the ﬁnite-temperature
behavior of the conductance (34) can be analyzed in a
similar manner. The subgap Lorentzian peak in J(ω),
cf. Eq. (35), causes the ﬁnite-T lineshape of a conven-
tional resonant tunneling conductance peak [1, 13], fea-
turing a temperature-induced decrease (increase) of the
peak conductance (width).

B. Shot noise

(cid:18)

ˆ

In addition to the conductance, another transport
property of interest is the shot noise power,
i.e., the
Fourier transformed current-current correlation function,

dteiω(t−t(cid:48))S11(t, t(cid:48)),

S11(ω) = −S12(ω) =

(40)
where S11(t, t(cid:48)) has been deﬁned in Eq. (26). Represent-
ing the correlation function by GFs, see Eq. (27), one
obtains an integral representation for S11(ω). We here
study the T = 0 shot noise power in the zero-frequency
limit, S(V ) = 2S11(ω → 0), which is compared to its
Poissonian value 2eI(V ) [13].
Our results for the Fano factor F = S/(2eI) are shown
in the right panel of Fig. 1. We observe that for τ (cid:28) 1,
the Poissonian limit F = 1 as predicted in Ref. [33] is
approached. With increasing transparency and/or lower
bias voltage, however, F is reduced and ultimately van-
ishes in the entire subgap regime at perfect transparency

with the rate Γ as deﬁned in Eq. (36). The cor-
responding Fano factor F = S/(2eI), with I =
(2eΓ/h) tan−1(eV /Γ), perfectly ﬁts the subgap part of
the results shown in the right panel of Fig. 1.

Beyond reproducing Eq. (41) for the subgap regime,
the GF approach also yields the shot noise power for
voltages above the gap. For eV (cid:29) ∆, the Fano factor
approaches the value F = 1 − τ, which is expected for
the corresponding spinless N-N junction [13]. We note
that even in the limit of ideal transparency (τ = 1), the
above-gap T = 0 shot noise is ﬁnite due to the simultane-
ous presence of both Andreev and quasiparticle processes
[49].

IV. TS-TS JUNCTION

Next we turn to the case of a TS-TS junction. For clar-
ity, we shall assume identical absolute values of the pair-

Note that J(ω) remains continuous at ω → ∆, where
J(∆) = τ 2/(2 − τ )2.
In the subgap regime |ω| < ∆, Eq. (35) yields a
Lorentzian peak of width Γ centered around ω = 0, which
describes the Majorana bound state leaking into the nor-
mal conductor with hybridization Γ. For τ (cid:28) 1, the
above-gap part of the spectral density is given by

which provides only a subleading contribution to the con-
ductance for low junction transparency. On the other
hand, in the limit of a fully transparent junction with
τ = 1, the rate Γ diverges and Eq. (35) reduces to
|ω| < ∆,
|ω| ≥ ∆.

where

J(eV )

(39)

is directly expressed in terms of the spectral current den-
sity J(ω) in Eq. (35). Equation (39) is equivalent to a
more complicated expression reported in Ref. [23]. It re-
covers the celebrated Majorana zero-bias peak with quan-
tized peak height 2e2/h and width Γ due to resonant An-
dreev reﬂection [25, 30, 33]. Near perfect transmission,
τ → 1, although the Majorana state is not well-deﬁned
anymore in view of the strong N-TS hybridization, con-
ductance quantization still remains robust [23, 31].
In
fact, G = 2e2/h persists throughout the entire subgap
regime |eV | < ∆, see Eq. (38). For |eV | (cid:29) ∆, Eq. (39)

IV B, we discuss the equilibrium case (V = 0), where the
Josephson junction is biased by a static phase diﬀerence

A. Fractional Josephson eﬀect

As detailed in App. B, using a similar calculation as in
the N-TS case, Eq. (23) yields the equilibrium Josephson

(43)

The integral in Eq. (42) can be done by residues, with
poles at ω = ±EA inﬁnitesimally shifted into the complex
plane. The ± sign corresponds to the conserved fermion
parity eigenvalue of the Josephson junction, cf. Ref. [1] for
a detailed discussion, and generates a pair of decoupled
(i.e., crossing) 4π-periodic Andreev bound states with
dispersion ±EA(φ0). From Eq. (42), we obtain

without contributions from continuum quasiparticles.
Since the GF formalism implicitly assumes a thermo-
dynamic average, Eq. (44) represents an average over
both parity states. The resulting current-phase relation
is therefore 2π-periodic. By restricting the integral in
Eq. (44) to a speciﬁc parity eigenvalue, one may arrive
at the well-known “fractional” Josephson eﬀect with a
4π-periodic current-phase relation [28, 36, 37] instead of
Eq. (44). Parity conservation is more directly visible in
our study of noise properties in Sec. IV B, where it is
responsible for the absence of transitions within the An-
dreev bound state sector.

B. Thermal ﬁnite-frequency noise

Next we discuss the (unsymmetrized) current noise at
ﬁnite frequency, S+(ω) = S11(ω), see Eq. (40), where
we consider the equilibrium case allowing for analytical
progress. (Nonequilibrium aspects of quantum noise in
TS-TS junctions have been studied in Refs. [40, 41].)
Putting V = 0, Eq. (27) yields the thermal noise cor-

relations in the form (cf. App. B)

dω1dω2δ(ω1 − ω2 + ω)

(45)

Here, Q = QA−c + Qc−c is symmetric in the frequency
arguments, Q(ω1, ω2) = Q(ω2, ω1), and can be decom-
posed into a part QA−c due to transitions between the
Andreev bound state sector (with |ω| = |EA|) and con-
tinuum quasiparticle states (with |ω| > ∆), plus a con-
tinuum contribution Qc−c. However, there is no contri-
bution from the Andreev sector alone, i.e., QA−A = 0.
This result should be contrasted to the case of non-
topological S-S junctions, where transitions at frequency
ω = 2EA are always present for τ < 1 [50] and imply
QA−A (cid:54)= 0. The absence of direct transitions between
the two Andreev bound states in a TS-TS junction can
be understood as manifestation of fermion parity conser-
vation, cf. Refs. [36, 38–40]. Technically, in our approach,
QA−A = 0 can be traced back to the orthogonality of
diﬀerent current eigenstates. While current eigenstates
always coincide with Andreev bound states for TS-TS
junctions, this holds true only at perfect transmission
(τ = 1) for the S-S case [51].

As is shown in App. B, Andreev-continuum transitions

yield

QA−c(ω1, ω2) = πτ δ(|ω1| − |EA|)Θ(|ω2| − ∆) (46)

The ﬁnite-frequency noise (45) thus receives two contri-

these two contributions to S+(ω) at T = 0, cf. Fig. 2.

rent as I(t) =(cid:80)

For a numerical evaluation of the current-voltage char-
acteristics,
it is convenient to adopt gauge II in the
Hamiltonian description. One can then follow the strat-
egy discussed in Ref. [14], where the corresponding prob-
lem has been solved for voltage-biased S-S contacts. For
the TS-TS case, we can similarly expand the mean cur-
˜Ineinω0t with ω0 = 2eV /, where we
arrive at expressions relating the current coeﬃcients ˜Im
to double Fourier GF components ( ˇGnm) formally iden-
tical to the expressions in Ref. [14]. The recursive algo-
rithm devised in Ref. [14] then directly applies after re-
placing the uncoupled GFs by ˇgT S, cf. Eq. (6), and yields
the numerically exact solution for the time-dependent
current ﬂowing through the junction.

n

In Fig. 3, we show the resulting d.c. component I = ˜I0
as a function of the bias voltage for several junction trans-
parencies τ. We ﬁnd that the current exhibits subgap
steps at eV = 2∆/(2n) with integer n, which are more
and more rounded as τ increases. These steps correspond
to the onset of even-order Andreev reﬂection processes.
We note that in a conventional S-QD-S junction con-
taining a resonant dot state, such subgap steps happen
at eV = 2∆/(2n + 1) [15], i.e., only odd-order Andreev
reﬂection processes contribute. For the TS-TS case at
hand, as explained in Ref. [42], the opposite situation is
encountered and only even orders are important. Eventu-
ally, at perfect transmission (τ = 1), a practically linear
dependence on voltage is reached after an abrupt con-
ductance jump to 2e2/h at zero bias. Our results in
Fig. 3 agree with those of Ref. [40] obtained by employing
scattering theory for the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equation.

bias behavior of a superconducting junction in the MAR

The above results are illustrated in Fig. 2. We note that
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem relates the frequency-

ticular, transition rates between Andreev and contin-
uum states directly follow from Eq. (48), cf. Eq. (14)
in Ref. [52].
In the inset of Fig. 2, we compare the
above results to ﬁnite-frequency noise in a topologically
trivial S-S junction with otherwise identical parame-
ters [50]. Clearly, for the TS-TS junction, there is no
ω = 2EA peak, and the frequency dependence of S+(ω)
for ω > ∆ + |EA| is rather diﬀerent.

C. Current-voltage characteristics

We now turn to the case of a voltage-biased TS-
TS junction, where we shall discuss the time-averaged
current-voltage characteristics in the T = 0 limit. As is
well known, subgap transport is then governed by MAR

regime can be understood in terms of the dynamics of
Andreev bound states. We here exploit the close re-
lation between low-bias transport in a TS-TS junction
and for an S-QD-S contact, where the tunnel junction
contains an interacting quantum dot at resonance. The
latter problem has been analyzed in Ref. [19], where
the Andreev bound state spectrum is well approximated
by EA (cid:39) ˜∆ cos(φ0/2), with a renormalized amplitude
˜∆ < ∆. The Andreev bound state dispersion is for-
mally identical to the TS-TS junction case in Eq. (43)
with the identiﬁcation ˜∆ =
τ ∆. However, while the
4π-periodicity of the Andreev states is robust and pro-
tected by parity conservation for the TS-TS junction, it is
only accidental in the S-QD-S case, since taking into ac-
count asymmetries in left/right tunnel couplings and/or
shifting the dot level slightly away from resonance, a gap
opens and 2π-periodicity will be restored.
In particu-
lar, for the S-QD-S case, spin degeneracy results in four
possible states, with the “even” sector corresponding to
the ±EA states and the “odd” sector to a pair of spin-
degenerate zero-energy states. In spite of these subtleties,
this correspondence yields an analytical solution for the
low-bias (eV (cid:28) ∆) part of the I-V curve in the TS-TS

junction. With the rate Γ∗ = τ ∆/4

τ → 1.

V. S-TS JUNCTION

In this section, we study the current I ﬂowing through
an S-TS junction between a conventional s-wave BCS
superconductor on the left side (j = 1) and a topological
TS wire on the right side (j = 2). The respective gaps are
denoted by ∆1 = ∆s and ∆2 = ∆. The noise properties
can also be determined using the present GF formalism,
see Eq. (27), but we leave this question to future work.
As discussed in Sec. II B, we here consider spin-
conserving tunneling processes, where (after a suitable
basis choice) only spin-↑ fermions in the s-wave super-
conductor are tunnel-coupled to the eﬀectively spinless
TS wire. The tunneling matrix W follows from W12 =
λeiφ(t)/2Π↑, see Eq. (21), with the projection operator
Π↑ = (σ0 + σz)/2. The time-dependent mean current
ﬂowing through the junction can be computed from the
general expression in Eq. (23). Working in gauge II and
using the Dyson equation (22), we ﬁnd

A. Equilibrium S-TS Josephson current

The equilibrium Josephson current through a phase-
biased S-TS junction has previously been studied by two
of us [43], where we found that there are no Andreev
bound states and hence the Josephson current vanishes
identically, I(φ0) = 0, as long as tunneling remains spin-
conserving. This result ﬁnds a simple explanation by
noting the diﬀerent pairing symmetries on both sides of
the junction: their orthogonality eﬀectively blocks the
supercurrent. In fact, in the absence of spin ﬂips during
tunneling events, the present GF approach conﬁrms this
result explicitly from Eq. (53) after putting V = 0, as we
brieﬂy demonstrate in App. C.

However, recent theoretical work [44] reported a ﬁ-
nite Josephson current through an S-TS junction, where
the s-wave superconductor has been represented by two
(opposite-spin) Kitaev chains in the continuum limit.
Employing a scattering approach under the assumption
of full channel mixing at the junction, which implicitly re-
quires strong spin-ﬂip scattering, the Josephson current
was then shown to be ﬁnite. Our approach can easily
handle spin-ﬂip scattering during tunneling [24], and we
have reproduced the results of Ref. [44] by such a gener-
alization. However, we here refrain from a detailed dis-
cussion of this issue, and instead continue with the I-V
characteristics of an S-TS junction under the assumption
of spin-conserving tunneling.

B. Voltage-biased S-TS junction

Next we turn to a discussion of the time-averaged
current through a voltage-biased S-TS junction. For a
constant voltage bias, we have φ(t) = 2eV t/, and the
d.c. current I(V ) through the S-TS junction follows from
Eq. (53) after some algebra given in App. C. For the
same reason that Andreev bound states do not appear
in the equilibrium case, MAR phenomena are absent in
this setup. We therefore do not need a double Fourier
representation of the GF. Despite of this simpliﬁcation,
the result given below is a bit lengthy, but at the same
time it is exact for arbitrary parameter values.
Using ω± = ω ± eV and f (ω) = 1− 2nF (ω) in Eq. (3),

Eq. (53) yields

In addition, we introduce eﬀective distribution functions
fe/h(ω) for electrons (e) and holes (h),

fe/h(ω) = f (ω)ν2(ω) + λ2f (ω∓)ν1(ω∓).

(58)
Since f (0) = 0, the Majorana peak in the DOS of the TS

tinuum part of ν2(ω) matters here. Finally, in the above

In the limit ∆s → 0, one ﬁnds after a short calcu-

N-TS junction, see Eq. (33). Furthermore, for τ (cid:28) 1,
Eq. (55) reduces to the I-V relation in Eq. (28) applicable
in the deep tunneling regime. An interesting recent study
[45] for precisely the same S-TS junction has reported a
universal peak height of the diﬀerential low-temperature
conductance. This conductance peak is asymmetric and
sets in at eV = ∆s, where G jumps to the value

Such a feature may be useful for the detection of Majo-
rana bound states. Equation (60) has been derived by
projecting away the TS continuum quasiparticles, i.e.,
by formally sending ∆ → ∞ [45]. Indeed, in that case,
Eq. (55) simpliﬁes to

directly leading to Eq. (60). Note that no current ﬂows
for eV < ∆s.

We illustrate the diﬀerential conductance G = dI/dV
obtained from Eq. (55) in Fig. 4, where GM is indicated
by the dashed blue line. The universal peak height (60)
follows for arbitrary τ as eV approaches ∆s from above.
For τ (cid:28) 1, Fig. 4 also conﬁrms the subgap conductance
lineshape, i.e, the dependence on V for eV < ∆ + ∆s,
derived in Ref. [45].

Generally, we observe from Fig. 4 that the conduc-
tance ﬁrst increases with increasing voltage, and then
strongly decreases except for very high junction trans-
parency. Note in particular that the conductance can
become negative, see Fig. 4. Such a negative diﬀerential
conductance is not surprising when tunneling through
a bound state, cf. Ref. [53]. For τ = 1, the ideal res-
onant Andreev reﬂection value G = 2e2/h is (almost)
reached as eV → ∆ + ∆s. For voltages eV > ∆ + ∆s and
τ = 1, the conductance then drops in a continuous fash-
ion. However, for τ < 1, we ﬁnd that the conductance
exhibits a ﬁnite jump to a smaller value as the voltage
goes through this threshold value separating the subgap
from the above-gap regime. Finally, at very large volt-
age, the conductance again approaches the Ohmic value
τ e2/h of the corresponding N-N junction.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

To conclude, we have formulated a general nonequi-
librium Green’s function framework to study transport
in hybrid devices containing Majorana wires. Our ap-
proach employs the boundary Green’s function of such
a Majorana wire, given in Eq. (6), which is suﬃciently
simple to allow us to derive several new analytical re-
sults and/or provide expressions that can be treated nu-

11.522.5300.51.01.52.0eV/ΔG (e2/h)0.80.60.40.2τ = 1merically in a straightforward manner. As applications,
we have discussed three elementary tunnel junctions in-
volving topologically nontrivial wires, where we take into
account both the Majorana sector and the continuum
quasiparticles on equal footing.

There are many interesting applications that could
be treated in the future by this Hamiltonian approach.
For instance, the approach should be suitable to study
multiterminal junctions or networks containing TS wires
[54–57], the coupling of Majorana wires to (interacting)
quantum dots [26, 27], and/or when a ﬁnite-length TS
wire is contacted by several electrodes [34, 58]. Other
possible directions are to include a.c. voltages in order
to study, e.g., fractional Shapiro steps in TS-TS junc-
tions [37, 40, 41, 59], or to study the interplay between
Coulomb charging eﬀects [60–63] and the presence of con-
tinuum quasiparticles. Moreover, it will be interesting to
extend the boundary GF given above for the class-D wire
also to other symmetry classes as well as to topological
superconductors of dimensionality higher than one. A
related generalization may employ a GF for the p-wave
superconductor covering a wider parameter regime, such
that one can study the phase transition between the non-
topological and the topological phase. We leave those
extensions for future work.

Appendix A: Boundary GF of semi-inﬁnite TS wire

Here we provide a derivation of the retarded/advanced
GF gR/A
T S (ω) in Eq. (6), which describes the low-energy
dynamics of electrons and holes at the boundary of a
semi-inﬁnite TS wire. Let us start from the standard
Kitaev chain model [28] in the topologically nontrivial
phase, for simplicity with chemical potential µ = 0. Us-
ing the pairing amplitude ∆ (assumed real positive), the
hopping matrix element t0, and spinless fermion operator

In the next step, we add a local potential scatterer of

the Dyson equation g = g(b) + g(b)U σzg. Letting the
impurity strength U → ∞, one eﬀectively cuts the chain

at site x = 0, and therefore the boundary GF of the semi-
inﬁnite TS wire follows as gT S(ω) = g11(ω). Solving the

Appendix B: On TS-TS junctions

In this Appendix, we provide derivations for several of

our results on TS-TS junctions in Sec. IV.

First,

let us sketch how to obtain the Josephson
current-phase relation I(φ0) in Sec. IV A. By using
Eq. (23) and adapting the expressions in Secs. II and
III from the N-TS to the TS-TS case, we arrive at the

to Eq. (42) in the main text.

Next we discuss the function Q(ω1, ω2) determining the
ﬁnite-frequency noise S+(ω), see Sec. IV B. To that end,
we deﬁne the lead Nambu matrix A(ω) = [GR − GA](ω)
with GR/A in Eq. (32), which corresponds to the spectral
function. We then obtain Q(ω1, ω2) from Eq. (27) in the

Appendix C: On S-TS junctions

In this appendix, we provide details about the calcula-
tion of the current through an S-TS junction, see Sec. V.
The uncoupled GFs ˇg1,2 are then given by ˇg1 = ˇgS and
ˇg2 = ˇgT S.

First, we derive the mean time-dependent current in
Eq. (53). Let us start from Eq. (23), which here takes

with W12 = λeiφ(t)/2Π↑. According to the Dyson equa-
tion (22), we have
ˆ

ˇG12(t, t) =

dt(cid:48)ˇg1(t − t(cid:48))W12(t(cid:48)) ˇG22(t(cid:48), t),

where ˇG−1

ˇΣ(t, t(cid:48)) = λ2e−i[φ(t)−φ(t(cid:48))]/2 ˇΣeq(t − t(cid:48)).

(C3)

Taking into account the reality constraint for the TS
Nambu spinors, Ψ = σxΨ∗, see Sec. II A, and using the

projected GF ˜g1 in Eq. (54), we ﬁnd

Inserting the above expressions into Eq. (C1), we arrive

Next, let us show that the equilibrium S-TS Josephson
current for ﬁxed phase diﬀerence φ0 vanishes identically
in the absence of spin-ﬂip tunneling. For V = 0, by em-
ploying the equilibrium relation for the Keldysh GF com-

already be seen from Eq. (53). By inserting Eq. (C7)
into Eq. (C5), we ﬁnd I(φ0) = 0, in accordance with
Ref. [43].

Finally, starting from Eq. (53), we sketch the deriva-
tion of the expression (55) for the time-averaged (d.c.)
current I under a constant voltage bias. Due to ab-
sence of MAR features, one can eﬀectively switch back to

[48] To see this, we employ a canonical transformation to
new operators, ˜c↑ = cos(θ)c1,↑ + sin(θ)c1,↓ and ˜c↓ =
− sin(θ)c1,↑ + cos(θ)c1,↓. This transformation leaves the
GF (12) invariant, but now only ˜c↑ is tunnel-coupled to
the TS wire, while its time-reversed partner ˜c↓ remains

decoupled from it. (The pairing term ∼ ∆s will still cou-
ple ˜c↑ and ˜c↓ within the bulk of the BCS superconductor.)
Without loss of generality, we can therefore put θ = 0.
