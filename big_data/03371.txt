ABSTRACT

Context. High angular resolution (sub)millimetre observations of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, now possible with the At-
acama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), allow direct imaging of these object’s photospheres. The physical properties
of the molecular material around these regions, which so far had only been studied by imaging of maser emission and (spatially unre-
solved) absorption spectroscopy, can be probed with radiative transfer modelling and compared to hydrodynamical model predictions.
The prototypical Mira variable, o Cet (Mira), has been observed as a Science Veriﬁcation target in the 2014 ALMA Long Baseline
Campaign, oﬀering the ﬁrst opportunity to study these physical conditions in detail.
Aims. With the longest baseline of 15 km, ALMA produces clearly resolved images of the continuum and molecular line emis-
sion/absorption at an angular resolution of ∼30 mas at 220 GHz. Models are constructed for Mira’s extended atmosphere to investigate
the physics and molecular abundances therein.
Methods. We image the data of 28SiO  = 0, 2 J = 5−4 and H2O v2 = 1 JKa,Kc
= 55,0−64,3 transitions and extract spectra from various
lines-of-sight towards Mira’s extended atmosphere. In the course of imaging the emission/absorption, we encountered ambiguities in
the resulting images and spectra that appear to be related to the performance of the CLEAN algorithm when applied to a combination
of extended emission, and compact emission and absorption. We address these issues by a series of tests and simulations. We derive
the gas density, kinetic temperature, molecular abundance and outﬂow/infall velocities in Mira’s extended atmosphere by modelling
the SiO and H2O lines.
Results. We resolve Mira’s millimetre continuum emission and our data are consistent with a radio photosphere with a brightness
temperature of 2611 ± 51 K. In agreement with recent results obtained with the Very Large Array, we do not conﬁrm the existence
of a compact region (< 5 mas) of enhanced brightness. Our modelling shows that SiO gas starts to deplete beyond 4 R(cid:63) and at a
kinetic temperature of (cid:46)600 K. The inner dust shells are probably composed of grain types other than pure silicates. During this
ALMA observation, Mira’s atmosphere generally exhibited infall motion, with a shock front of velocity (cid:46)12 km s−1 outside the radio
photosphere. Despite the chaotic nature of Mira’s atmosphere, the structures predicted by the hydrodynamical model, codex, can
reproduce the observed spectra in astonishing detail; while some other models fail when confronted with the new data.
Conclusions. For the ﬁrst time, millimetre-wavelength molecular absorption against the stellar continuum has been clearly imaged.
Combined with radiative transfer modelling, the ALMA data successfully demonstrates the ability to reveal the physical conditions of
the extended atmospheres and inner winds of AGB stars in unprecedented detail. Long-term monitoring of oxygen-rich evolved stars
will be the key to understand the unsolved problem of dust condensation and the wind-driving mechanism.

1. Introduction

Mira A (o Ceti; Mira) is an oxygen-rich, long-period variable
star on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Together with Mira B
(VZ Ceti), possibly a white dwarf (Sokoloski & Bildsten 2010),
they form the symbiotic binary system Mira AB. Mira A is the
prototype of Mira variables. Its period of visual brightness vari-
ation is about 332 days and the visual V-band magnitude of
the star varies by up to about 8.1 mag (a factor of > 1700) in
each cycle (based on the data in the American Association of
Variable Star Observers, AAVSO, International Database). The
large variation in the visual magnitude is caused by a combined

(cid:63) Member of the International Max Planck Research School (IM-
PRS) for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Universities of Bonn and
Cologne.

eﬀect of stellar pulsation and variable opacity of metal oxides
whose abundance changes with the eﬀective temperature of the
star (Reid & Goldston 2002). The distance of the Mira AB sys-
tem was estimated to be 110±9 pc (Haniﬀ et al. 1995), which is
based on the period-luminosity relation derived by Feast et al.
(1989), the infrared K-band magnitude from Robertson & Feast
(1981) and the period of the visual V variation from the GCVS
(Kholopov 1987). We will adopt this, which is roughly consis-
tent with the revised Hipparcos value of 92±10 pc (van Leeuwen
2007), throughout this article.

Traditionally, AGB star atmospheres have been probed by
molecular absorption spectroscopy, which delivers spatially un-
resolved line-of-sight information. Examples include the detec-
tion of the near-infrared H2O absorption band from the warm
molecular forming layer (known as the MOLsphere) around M

giant stars and Mira variables with the Infrared Space Observa-
tory (ISO) (e.g. Tsuji et al. 1997; Woitke et al. 1999; Tsuji 2000).
In addition, mid-infrared interferometry with the Very Large
Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) can also probe the molecular
layers and dust shells around these stars (e.g. Ohnaka et al. 2005;
Karovicova et al. 2011). SiO and/or H2O maser emission in the
extended atmospheres of Mira variables has been imaged, see,
for examples, Cotton et al. (2004) and Perrin et al. (2015) with
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and Reid & Menten
(2007) with the Very Large Array (VLA).

In order to test the predictions by existing hydrodynam-
ical models for the extended atmospheres of Mira variables,
which typically has a radius of only a few R(cid:63) (a few tens of
milli-arcseconds for Mira A), high angular and spectral reso-
lution observations of the molecular emission and absorption
from these regions are mandatory. The Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with long baselines thus al-
lows us to reach the required angular resolution at high sen-
sitivity and to study the detailed kinematics of the innermost
envelope of Mira A. Observations of radio and (sub)millimetre
wavelength molecular line emission/absorption, in particular the
rotational transitions not exhibiting strong masers, may be used
to compare and test the predicted structures of the extended at-
mospheres by hydrodynamical models. Through modelling the
radiative transfer of the transition lines with the predicted at-
mospheric structures as the inputs, synthesised spectra can be
produced and compared to the observed ones.

In this article, we present the new ALMA observations of the
Mira AB system, which was selected as one of the Science Ver-
iﬁcation (SV) targets in the 2014 ALMA Long Baseline Cam-
paign to demonstrate the high angular resolution capability of
ALMA (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). Based on the visual
magnitude data reported by the AAVSO, the stellar phase of
Mira A is ∼0.45 at the time of this observation, and we will adopt
this phase throughout the article. In Section 2, we describe the
SV observation of Mira AB and the data processing. In Section
3, we present the results including the radio continuum data of
Mira A and B in the SV dataset, and the images and spectra of the
SiO and H2O lines from Mira A as covered in the observations.
In Section 4, we present our radiative transfer modelling results
of the SiO and H2O spectra of Mira A. In Section 5, we discuss
the implications of our modelling results for our understanding
of Mira A’s extended atmosphere, including the structures, dust
condensation process, shock dissipation and the kinematics and
compare with predictions from hydrodynamical models.

2. Observations and data processing
The Mira AB system was observed with ALMA on 2014 Oc-
tober 17 and 25 (ALMA Band 3) and on 2014 October 29 and
November 1 (ALMA Band 6) as part of the 2014 ALMA Long
Baseline Campaign Science Veriﬁcation with the longest base-
line of 15.24 km. (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). By referring
to the AAVSO visual data for Mira, we ﬁnd that the ALMA ob-
servations took place between the visual phases 0.42 (2014 Oct
17) and 0.47 (2014 Nov 01)1.

1 The period of Mira changes by a few days on the time span of
decades (Templeton & Karovska 2009) and the dates of maximum need
to be determined observationally for each cycle to provide a reliable
phase scaling. In recent cycles, however, the phases preceding and dur-
ing the maxima cannot be observed in the optical because Mira is too
close to the Sun. To obtain the phases of the ALMA observations in
2014, we ﬁrst phased the AAVSO data for the cycles in 2000–2013

The shortest baselines (and the maximum number of anten-
nae) in the observations of Bands 3 and 6 are 29.07 m (38) and
15.23 m (39), respectively. The maximum recoverable scales2 of
the SiO lines in Bands 3 and 6 are therefore ∼14(cid:48)(cid:48).8 and ∼11(cid:48)(cid:48).3,
respectively, and that of the H2O v2 = 1 line in Band 6 is
10(cid:48)(cid:48).5. In Band 3, three continuum windows at 88.2, 98.2 and
100.2 GHz were observed, in addition to four spectral line win-
dows of 58.6 MHz bandwidth around the transitions of 28SiO
 = 0, 1, 2 J = 2−1 and 29SiO  = 0 J = 2−1. The channel width
of the spectral windows is 61.0 kHz (∼0.21 km s−1). In Band 6,
a continuum window at 229.6 GHz together with six spectral
line windows of 117.2 MHz bandwidth around 28SiO  = 0, 1, 2
J = 5− 4, 29SiO  = 0 J = 5− 4, H2O v2 = 1 JKa,Kc
= 55,0 − 64,3,
and the H30α recombination line were observed. The channel
width of the four SiO windows is 122.1 kHz (∼0.17 km s−1) and
that of the H2O and H recombination line windows is 61.0 kHz
(∼0.08 km s−1). Table 1 summarises the observed spectral lines
and their parameters.

The SV data had been calibrated by staﬀ members of the
Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) and the ALMA Regional Cen-
tres (ARCs), with the Common Astronomy Software Applica-
tions (CASA; McMullin et al. 2007) package3 version 4.2.2.
Detailed calibration scripts, preliminarily calibrated data prod-
ucts (i.e., without self-calibration), and self-calibration solutions
for both continuum and spectral line data are available at the
ALMA Science Portal4. Self-calibration solutions were derived
from the continuum data for the continuum data itself; and from
the strongest spectral channels of the 28SiO  = 1 data, which
exhibits strong maser emission, for the spectral line data. We
downloaded the self-calibration solutions from the ALMA Sci-
ence Portal and applied them to the preliminarily calibrated data,
and then imaged the continuum and spectral line data. We use
CASA version 4.2.2 for the self-calibration and imaging (except
for the image binning task as mentioned below), and the Miriad
package5 for our continuum analysis (Sect. 3.1 and Appendix A
(Sault et al. 1995)).
We have determined the centre of Mira A’s continuum emis-
sion to be at (RA, Dec) = (02h19m20s.795,−02◦58(cid:48)43(cid:48)(cid:48).05) =
(34◦.836 646,−2◦.978 625) by ﬁtting its image, produced from
the visibility data before self-calibration, in the 229.6 GHz con-
tinuum windows (i.e., spectral windows spw = 0, 7 in the SV
dataset). We adopt these coordinates as the absolute position
of Mira A. The position and proper motion of Mira A in the
Hipparcos Catalogue are (34◦.836 611,−2◦.977 061) at the Julian
epoch 1991.25 and (9.33 ± 1.99,−237.36 ± 1.58) mas yr−1, re-
spectively (van Leeuwen 2007). At the epoch of the ALMA SV
observation, ∼2014.83 (JD 2 456 959.6 and JD 2 456 962.7), the
expected coordinates of Mira A due to proper motion should be
(34◦.836 667,−2◦.978 615) ± (0◦.000 013, 0◦.000 010). So the ob-

with a period of 333 days and the date of maximum on JD 2 452 161.0
which had a bright and very well-deﬁned maximum (Kami´nski et al.
in prep.). Then, the data covering the cycle of the 2014 ALMA obser-
vations were phased with the same period but their date of maximum
(or phase 0) was determined by a phase shift of about +0.05 with re-
spect to JD 2 452 161.0 (as adopted for the 2000–2013 cycles). In this
way we are able to match the data in the 2014 cycle with the phased
data from 2000–2013 and therefore we obtained slightly later phases
for the ALMA observations than those calculated from a periodicity
scale given by AAVSO and used in Matthews et al. (2015).

Notes. Columns are, from left to right, molecule, quantum numbers of observed transition, rest frequency, energy level of the upper state, and
channel width in velocity of the raw data. The SiO and 29SiO transition frequencies were taken form the Cologne Database for Molecular Spec-
troscopy (CDMS). They are based on laboratory data presented by Müller et al. (2013) and have an accuracy of about 1 kHz, except for the SiO
 = 0, J = 5 − 4 transition which has an accuracy of 2 kHz. The H2O transition frequency is taken from Belov et al. (1987) and has an accuracy of
50 kHz.

served absolute position of Mira A is within 2σ from the pre-
dicted position of the Hipparcos Catalogue.

We then produced two sets of spectral line images, with and
without subtraction of the continuum, respectively. The contin-
uum was subtracted, with the uvcontsub task in CASA, by ﬁt-
ting a linear polynomial to the real and imaginary parts of the
visibility data of the line-free (i.e., continuum-only) channels in
each spectral window. Our selection of the line-free channels
was slightly diﬀerent from that in the example imaging script
provided along with the SV data6.

The spectral line image data cubes of the SiO and H2O lines
in ALMA Band 6 were created by the image deconvolution task,
clean, in CASA. The task performs an inverse Fourier trans-
form to the visibility data (“uv-data”) and creates a raw image
data cube (the “DIRTY” image), then deconvolves the ALMA
point-spread function from each frequency plane of the image
with the Clark image deconvolution algorithm (Högbom 1974;
Clark 1980) (the “CLEAN” process). The product of image de-
convolution for each frequency is a set of point sources (the
CLEAN component models) which, in aggregate, reproduce the
same input “DIRTY” image when convolving with the array’s
point-spread function. The task ﬁnally restores the CLEAN com-
ponent models with a restoring beam (the CLEAN beam) of pa-
rameters either determined from ﬁtting the point-spread func-
tion (taking its FWHM) or speciﬁed by the user. The local stan-
dard of rest (LSR) velocities covered by the image cubes range
from 26.7 km s−1 to 66.7 km s−1, centred at the systemic (centre-
of-mass) LSR velocity of 46.7 km s−1, which corresponds to
57.0 km s−1 in the heliocentric rest frame. We have determined
the systemic velocity from the mid-point of the total velocity
ranges of the entire line-emitting/absorbing region, assuming the
global infall or expansion motions at the extreme velocities are
symmetric about the stellar systemic velocity. We weighted the
visibilities with a robust (Briggs) parameter of RBriggs = 0.5 and
CLEANed the images down to a threshold of ∼2–3 mJy beam−1,
which is about 1.5 times the rms noise level. We restored the im-
ages with a circular beam of FWHM 0(cid:48)(cid:48).032 for the 28SiO and
29SiO lines, and of FWHM 0(cid:48)(cid:48).030 for the H2O v2 = 1 line. The
FWHM of the beams are the geometric means of the major- and
minor-axes of the elliptical point-spread functions ﬁtted by the
clean task.
At 220 GHz, the primary beam FWHM of the 12-m array
is about 28(cid:48)(cid:48), which is much larger than the size of the line
emission/absorption, and therefore no primary beam correction
is needed. Figure 1 is the only primary beam-corrected image

6 available from the CASA Guides: http://casaguides.nrao.
edu/index.php?title=ALMA2014_LBC_SVDATA&oldid=18077

in this article, which shows remote emission in the vibrational
ground state 28SiO up to a distance of ∼3(cid:48)(cid:48). There is no signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence in the ﬂux of detectable emission from the image
without primary beam correction.

The spectral line channel maps presented in Sect. 3.2 and
Appendix C are further binned, with the image binning task
imrebin (new from version 4.3.0) in CASA version 4.4.0. We
use Python to generate plots, with the aid of the matplotlib
plotting library (version 1.4.3) (Hunter 2007), the PyFITS mod-
ule (version 3.3), and the Kapteyn Package7 (version 2.3) (Ter-
louw & Vogelaar 2015).
The cell size and total size of the images are 0(cid:48)(cid:48).005 × 0(cid:48)(cid:48).005
and 15(cid:48)(cid:48) × 15(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. Figure 1 shows the map of the SiO
 = 0 J = 5 − 4 line at the systemic velocity channel over a
7(cid:48)(cid:48).5 × 7(cid:48)(cid:48).5 region centred at Mira A. As shown in this ﬁgure,
there is remote, arc-like emission extending up to about 3 arc-
sec from the star between the LSR velocities of 43.7 km s−1 and
49.7 km s−1.

Moreover, we use the images without continuum subtraction
for our spectral line modelling (Sects. 3.3 and later), instead of
the continuum-subtracted images as in the reference images in
the ALMA Science Portal. As a result, our images only con-
tain emission from spectral line and/or the radio continuum from
Mira A and B throughout, without any real negative signals. As
we will explain in further detail in Appendix B, we ﬁnd spuri-
ous “bumps” in the absorption proﬁles of continuum-subtracted
spectra. We believe that the image deconvolution of the strong
line emission surrounding Mira’s radio photosphere may have
impaired the deconvolution of the region showing line absorp-
tion against the background continuum. The images (and hence
the spectra) deconvolved without continuum subtracted should
better represent the real emission and absorption of the SiO and
H2O lines.

3. Results
3.1. Continuum

Matthews et al. (2015) and Vlemmings et al. (2015) have in-
dependently analysed the continuum data of the Mira AB sys-
tem in both ALMA Bands 3 (96 GHz) and 6 (229 GHz) of this
SV dataset. Additionally, Matthews et al. (2015) include the
continuum data from their Q-band (46 GHz) observation with
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in 2014; Vlem-
mings et al. (2015) also include the continuum data from ALMA
Band 7 (338 GHz), of which some results have been reported

by Ramstedt et al. (2014). From this SV dataset, both Matthews
et al. (2015) and Vlemmings et al. (2015) found that the visi-
bilities of Mira A in the continuum of Band 6 can be better ﬁt-
ted with a two-component model, consisting of an elliptical uni-
form disk plus an additional Gaussian component, than a single-
component model. Moreover, Vlemmings et al. (2015) found
that the additional Gaussian component to be a compact, bright
hotspot with a FWHM of ∼4.7 mas and a brightness temperature
of ∼10 000 K.

We have conducted a similar analysis of the continuum data
of Mira A and B as these authors for the Band 6 data. From the
continuum map, the total ﬂux of Mira A is 149.70 ± 0.04 mJy
and that of Mira B is 11.19 ± 0.04 mJy. In our model ﬁtting, the
elliptical uniform disk component for Mira A has a size of about
(51.2±0.1) mas×(41.0±0.1) mas, PA = −45.0◦±0.5◦ and a ﬂux
of S 229.6 GHz = 102±9 mJy. This corresponds to a brightness tem-
perature of 1630±175 K. For the additional Gaussian component
of Mira A, the ﬁtted ﬂux is about 47 ± 9 mJy and its FWHM is
about (26.4±0.2) mas×(22.4±0.2) mas, PA = 34.0◦±1.7◦, which
is much larger than the size of the purported 4.7 mas-hotspot.
The brightness temperature of this Gaussian component corre-
sponds to 1856 ± 419 K, which is much smaller than 10 000 K.
Our elliptical Gaussian model for Mira B has a FWHM of about
(25.5± 0.3) mas× (22.5± 0.3) mas, PA = 72.7◦ ± 3.6◦ and a ﬂux
of about (11.3 ± 0.5) mJy. Our results are in general consistent
with those reported by Matthews et al. (2015). However, we did
not ﬁnd any evidence of the compact hotspot or reproduce the
similar results of the visibility ﬁtting as reported by Vlemmings
et al. (2015). We present our detailed continuum analysis of the
visibility data in Appendix A.

In this section, we only present our model ﬁtting results using
a single model component for Mira, i.e., an elliptical uniform
disk or an elliptical Gaussian, but not both. Table 2 shows the
results of our single-component ﬁtting in the continuum window
centred at 229.6 GHz. The brightness temperature of the uniform
disk model of Mira A is found to be 2611 ± 51 K.

In addition, we have also created continuum images by in-
tegrating all the line-free channels in each of the four SiO and
one H2O spectral line windows. By calculating the total ﬂux, S ν,
from Mira A within a 0(cid:48)(cid:48).25-radius circle (which safely includes
all possible continuum emission from Mira A, but does not con-
tain any emission from Mira B) at respective frequencies, ν, we
derive an independent spectral index (using the spectral line win-
dows in Band 6 only) of 1.82± 0.33, which is consistent with the
value (1.86) derived by Reid & Menten (1997a).

3.2. Images
Figure 1 shows the map of the SiO  = 0 J = 5 − 4 transition in
the LSR velocity of 46.7 km s−1, which is the systemic (centre-
of-mass) velocity of Mira A, over a 7(cid:48)(cid:48).5 × 7(cid:48)(cid:48).5 box centred at
Mira A. The position of Mira B, 02h19m20s.826,−02◦58(cid:48)43(cid:48)(cid:48).12,
as determined by ﬁtting its image produced from the uv-data be-
fore self-calibration, is also indicated on the map. To the west of
Mira A, the SiO vibrational ground state emission extends to a
larger projected radial distance than other directions. This emis-
sion feature emerges from the west and north-west of Mira A
and appears as an arc-like feature, which turns south at around
2(cid:48)(cid:48) west of the star and reaches a maximum projected distance of
∼3(cid:48)(cid:48).

As we will explain in Appendix B,

there are spurious
“bumps” in the spectra extracted from the line-of-sight towards
the continuum of Mira in the maps produced from the data
continuum-subtracted before imaging. Since we are more con-

Article number, page 4 of 55

ﬁdent in the quality of the image deconvolution without the
subtraction of the continuum, we extract the spectra from the
maps retaining the continuum (“full data maps”) for our radia-
tive transfer modelling in Sects. 3.3 and later. These full data
maps are presented in Appendix C. In this section, we only
show the maps that are ﬁrst imaged with the continuum, and
then continuum-subtracted with the CASA task imcontsub.
Such post-imaging continuum subtraction can avoid the spuri-
ous features seen in pre-imaging continuum-subtracted images
(and also the spectra).

Figure 2 shows the continuum-subtracted channel maps of
the SiO  = 0 J = 5 − 4 transition in the LSR velocity range of
35.7–58.7 km s−1 over a 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1 × 1(cid:48)(cid:48).1 box centred at Mira A (Mira
hereafter). Contour lines at the −36, −6, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72σ
levels, where σ = 0.80 mJy beam−1, are drawn to indicate the re-
gion with signiﬁcant line absorption (yellow contours; negative
signals) or emission (white contours; positive signals).

Figure 3 shows the same channel maps as Fig. 2, but zoomed
in to show the inner 0(cid:48)(cid:48).22 × 0(cid:48)(cid:48).22 region around Mira. While,
globally speaking, the emission of the vibrational ground state
SiO line in the inner winds of Mira ((cid:46)0(cid:48)(cid:48).2) appears to be
spherically symmetric, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant inhomogeneities with
stronger emission from clumps that are localised in relatively
small regions and which stretch over limited velocity ranges.

As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption and emission in the
J = 5 − 4 transition of the vibrational ground state of the 29SiO
isotopologue appears to have a very similar extent as that ob-
served in the analogous line to the main isotope of SiO. On
larger scales, the 29SiO emission also appears to extend to the
west of Mira, while its intensity falls oﬀ much more rapidly
with increasing radius and no signiﬁcant emission is seen beyond
∼0.5(cid:48)(cid:48). This is expected because the isotopic ratio of 28Si/29Si in
oxygen-rich giants is (cid:38)13 (e.g. Tsuji et al. 1994; Decin et al.
2010; Ohnaka 2014). The 29SiO emission within ∼0(cid:48)(cid:48).2 also ex-
hibits (1) general spherical symmetry and (2) localised, clumpy
structures with more intense emission. While the maps in both
isotopologues have the similar overall morphology, the peaks in
the 29SiO emission do not all coincide with the 28SiO peaks.

Figures 5 and 6 show the continuum-subtracted maps of the
= 55,0 − 64,3
SiO  = 2 J = 5 − 4 and H2O v2 = 1 JKa,Kc
lines, respectively. Since the emission of these two lines is more
smoothly distributed than that in the vibrational ground state SiO
and 29SiO lines, we can clearly see ring-like emission structures
around the line absorption against Mira’s continuum in the ve-
locity channels around the systemic velocity (46.7 km s−1). In
most velocity channels, the emission from both lines are con-
ﬁned well within 0(cid:48)(cid:48).1 from the centre of the continuum, and there
is no remote emission beyond ∼0(cid:48)(cid:48).1 as in the ground state SiO
lines.

Close to the systemic velocity, there is a clump at about 0(cid:48)(cid:48).05
to the east of Mira which strongly emits in both the SiO  = 2 and
H2O v2 = 1 lines. The brightness temperatures of the SiO  = 2
and H2O v2 = 1 emission are ∼600 K and ∼1000 K, respectively.
This eastern clump is not prominent, however, in the vibrational
ground state SiO and 29SiO lines which have very low excitation
energies (i.e., the upper-state energy, Eup). This clump therefore
probably contains shock-heated gas at a high kinetic tempera-
ture (Tkin (cid:38) 1000 K). On the other hand, the intensely-emitting
clumps in the ground state of SiO or 29SiO lines do not appear in
the highly excited SiO  = 2 and H2O v2 = 1 lines, which have
excitation energies of Eup/k (cid:38) 3500 K.

Notes. The columns are (from left to right): the object being ﬁtted and the type of model (uniform disk or Gaussian), total ﬂux at 229.6 GHz
(S 229.6 GHz, mJy), major axis (θmaj, mas), minor axis (θmin, mas), the position angle (P.A., degrees) of each elliptical component, and the brightness
temperature (Tb, K) of the uniform disk model for Mira A. The quoted uncertainties are all the formal quantities resulting from model ﬁtting.
The real uncertainty of the ﬂux is dominated by the absolute ﬂux calibration, which is estimated to be of order 20%. The uncertainty of the
brightness temperature including the contribution from the absolute ﬂux calibration is about 565 K. The total integrated ﬂuxes of Mira A and B in
the 229.6-GHz continuum map are 149.70 ± 0.04 mJy and 11.19 ± 0.04 mJy, respectively.

3.3. Spectra

We have extracted the SiO and H2O spectra from the centre of
Mira’s continuum, and from an array of positions at radii 0(cid:48)(cid:48).032,
0(cid:48)(cid:48).064, 0(cid:48)(cid:48).096, 0(cid:48)(cid:48).128 and 0(cid:48)(cid:48).160 from the centre, along the legs
at PA = 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, and 270◦. The positions are shown in Fig.
7, which is the map of SiO  = 0 J = 5 − 4, without subtraction
of the continuum, in the channel of the stellar systemic velocity
(vLSR = 46.7 km s−1). The full set of the spectra will be pre-
sented along with the modelling results in Sect. 4. In view of the
fact that the inner envelope around Mira is partially ﬁlled with
intense clumpy emission, we did not compute the azimuthally-
averaged spectra in order to avoid the averaged spectra from be-
ing contaminated by isolated intense emission and to obtain a
more representative view of the general physical conditions of
the envelope.

Figure 8 shows the spectra of various lines in ALMA Band 6
extracted from the centre of the continuum. As we did not sub-
tract the continuum from the data, the ﬂat emission towards the
low- and high-velocity ends of the spectra represents the ﬂux
from the radio continuum of Mira near the frequencies of the
respective spectral lines. In Appendix B, we will show the spec-
tra with the continuum subtracted (in the visibility data) before
imaging.
The SiO  = 1 J = 5− 4 transition shows strong maser emis-
sion across a large range of LSR velocities, which introduces
sharp spikes in its spectrum. For other lines which do not show
strong maser emission (i.e., all except SiO  = 1), absorption
against the continuum ranges between the oﬀset velocity (rela-
tive to the stellar LSR velocity) of approximately −4 km s−1 and
+14 km s−1. The absorption is in general redshifted relative to
the systemic velocity. This indicates that the bulk of the mate-
rial in the inner envelope is infalling towards Mira during the
ALMA SV observation (near stellar phase 0.45). Infall motion
at phase 0.45 is expected for another oxygen-rich Mira variable,
W Hya, based on the detailed modelling of the CO ∆ = 3 line
proﬁles, as observed by Lebzelter et al. (2005), presented in the
paper of Nowotny et al. (2010). The CO ∆ = 3 lines probe
the pulsation-dominated layers of the atmospheres of Mira vari-
ables, and therefore the radial velocity variation of these lines
would indicate the infall or expansion velocities of the global
motion of the extended atmospheres below the dust formation
(and circumstellar wind acceleration) regions (e.g. Hinkle et al.
1982; Nowotny et al. 2005a).
The spectra of 28SiO  = 0 J = 5 − 4 and 29SiO  = 0
J = 5 − 4 appear to be virtually identical. From the similarity of
the line proﬁles and considering the high expected isotopic ratio
of 28Si/29Si ((cid:38) 13), the vibrational ground state 28SiO and 29SiO
lines we see in Fig. 8 are likely to be both very optically thick
(saturated) and thermalised.

In Fig. 8, we can also see trends in the width and depth of
the absorption proﬁles with excitation. The vibrationally excited
SiO  = 2 and H2O v2 = 1 lines show narrower and shallower
absorption than the two ground state SiO lines. This suggests
that the vibrationally excited energy levels are less readily pop-
ulated than the ground state levels, and hence the kinetic tem-
perature of the bulk of the infalling material should be much
lower than 3500 K, which corresponds to the excitation ener-
gies of SiO  = 2 and H2O v2 = 1 lines. This also explains
the small radial extent of these two lines as shown in the channel
maps because the kinetic temperature (and hence the excitation)
in general falls oﬀ with the radial distance from the star. Be-
cause the SiO  = 2 and H2O v2 = 1 lines have very similar
excitation energy (Eup/k ∼ 3500 K), the diﬀerence in their line

proﬁles is probably due to diﬀerences in the molecular abun-
dance and molecular parameters such as the (de-)excitation rate
coeﬃcients.

There are two features in the spectra that strongly con-
strain our modelling in Sect. 4. The ﬁrst one is the small
blueshifted emission feature at the oﬀset velocities between −10
and −3 km s−1. The size of the synthesised beam under robust
weighting (RBriggs = 0.5) is about 0(cid:48)(cid:48).03, which is comparable
to that of the disk of the continuum emission (with minor axis
about 0(cid:48)(cid:48).04). Hence, some emission from the hottest inner lay-
ers of the envelope just outside the edge of the continuum disk
is expected to “leak” into the beam. Since the innermost enve-
lope shows global infall kinematics, the ﬂux “leakage” should
appear as excess blueshifted emission, i.e., an inverse P Cygni
proﬁle. We have also checked the spectra at diﬀerent oﬀset po-
sitions (some of which are modelled in Sect. 4) and found that
over the same blueshifted velocity range, the excess emission
becomes more prominent as the continuum level decreases to-
wards outer radial distances. For the H2O transition, we also ﬁnd
a (much weaker) emission component near the oﬀset velocity of
−3 km s−1, and a similar check at diﬀerent oﬀset positions also
indicates that the component is likely to be real.
The other feature is presented by the redshifted wings in the
oﬀset velocity range between +10 and +14 km s−1 of the 28SiO
 = 0 and 2, and the 29SiO  = 0 lines, which do not show strong
maser emission. As shown in Fig. 8, the redshifted part of the ab-
sorption proﬁles of all these lines appears to be nearly identical.
The lines could be in the optically thin regime only if the isotopic
ratio of 28SiO/29SiO is close to unity, which is not expected. So
we believe that all the lines are in the optically thick regime in
this velocity range. The brightness temperatures of the redshifted
wings thus give an indication of the kinetic temperature of the
coolest gas around the corresponding (infall) velocities.

4. Radiative transfer modelling
We have modelled the H2O and SiO spectra with the radiative
transfer code ratran8 (Hogerheijde & van der Tak 2000). The
public version of the code accepts one-dimensional input mod-
els only. Despite the clumpy structures of the inner envelope,
we ﬁnd that the line spectra exhibit general spherical symmetry
within ∼0(cid:48)(cid:48).16 and therefore 1-D modelling is applicable. Since
the ALMA SV observations only provide a snapshot of Mira’s
extended atmosphere in its highly variable pulsation cycles, and
the hydrodynamical models that we will compare and discuss
in Sect. 5.3 are also one-dimensional, using multi-dimensional
radiative transfer code probably does not lead to better under-
standing of the general physical conditions of Mira’s extended
atmosphere. ratran solves the coupled level population and ra-
diative transfer equations with the Monte Carlo method and gen-
erates an output image cube for each of the modelled lines. We
then convolved the image cubes with the same restoring beam
as in our image processing and extracted the modelled spectra
from the same set of positions as the observed spectra (Figure
7). In the following subsections, we describe the details of our
modelling, including the molecular data of H2O and SiO, and the
input physical models for the inner envelope with the continuum.

weights of the energy levels, and the Einstein A coeﬃcients (the
rates of spontaneous emission), frequencies, upper level ener-

only include 189 energy levels up to 5130 K in order to speed
up the calculation. The selection includes 1804 radiative tran-
sitions and 17 766 downward collisional transitions. The num-
bers of energy levels and transitions were reduced by more than
half and three quarters, respectively, as compared to the original
LAMDA ﬁle. Experiments have shown that such truncation of
the dataﬁle only has minute eﬀects on the modelled spectra. The

Einstein A coeﬃcients were provided by the BT2 water line list10
(Barber et al. 2006) and the collisional rate coeﬃcients of H2O
with ortho-H2 and para-H2 were calculated by Faure & Josselin
(2008). The rates for ortho-H2 and para-H2 were weighted in the
method described in Schöier et al. (2005).

4.2. SiO molecular data

Our radiative transfer modelling of SiO lines considers the
molecule’s vibrational ground and the ﬁrst two excited states
( = 0, 1 and 2) up to an upper-state energy, Eup/k, of about
5120 K, similar to that for our H2O modelling. There are totally
167 rotational energy levels in these vibrational states, where
J( = 0) ≤ 69, J( = 1) ≤ 56, and J( = 2) ≤ 39. Among these
energy levels are 435 radiative transitions (subject to the dipole
selection rule ∆J = ±1) and 13 861 downward collisional tran-
sitions. The energies and statistical weights of the energy levels,

and the line frequencies and Einstein A coeﬃcients of the radia-
tive transitions are obtained from the EBJT SiO line list11 (Bar-
ton et al. 2013). These values are similar to those in the Cologne
Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS)12 (version Jan
2014) (Müller et al. 2001, 2005, 2013).
The rate coeﬃcients for collisions between SiO and H2
molecules in the vibrational ground state ( = 0 → 0) are ex-
trapolated from the scaled (by 1.38) rate coeﬃcients between
SiO–He collisions as derived by Dayou & Balança (2006). The
SiO–He rate coeﬃcients only include rotational levels up to
J( = 0) = 26 and H2 gas temperature up to 300 K (Dayou &
Balança 2006). We extrapolate the  = 0 → 0 rate coeﬃcients to
higher J and T with the methods presented in Appendix D.1. Our
temperature-extrapolated rate coeﬃcients are consistent, within
the same order of magnitude, with the corresponding values in
the LAMDA SiO dataﬁle (Schöier et al. 2005). Rate coeﬃcients
of the rotational transitions involving vibrationally excited states
(i.e.,  = 1, 2, where ∆ = 0, 1) can be computed with the
inﬁnite-order sudden (IOS) approximation (e.g. Goldﬂam et al.
1977), of which the parameters are given by Bieniek & Green
(1983a,b) for J() ≤ 39 and 1000 K ≤ T ≤ 3000 K. We extrap-
olate the parameters of Bieniek & Green (1983a,b) to higher J
(see Appendix D.2) and assume the temperature dependence of
the parameters for T < 1000 K and T > 3000 K to be the same
as that for 1000 K ≤ T ≤ 3000 K. For  = 2 → 0 transitions, we
simply assume the rate coeﬃcients from  = 2 → 0 to be 10% of
those from  = 2 → 1 transitions. We note that these coeﬃcients
in general do not aﬀect the radiative transfer signiﬁcantly (e.g.
Langer & Watson 1984; Lockett & Elitzur 1992).

Our extrapolation scheme of the SiO–H2 collisional rate co-
eﬃcients (Appendix D) is diﬀerent from that described by Doel
(1990), on which the rate coeﬃcients adopted by Doel et al.
(1995) and Humphreys et al. (1996) are based. In particular,
their extrapolation of the rate coeﬃcients (including those for
 = 0 → 0 transitions) was based entirely on the set of pa-
rameters given by Bieniek & Green (1983a,b), which was the
most complete and accurate one available at that time; they
also refrained from further extrapolating the parameters beyond
J() = 39 for  = 0, 1, . . . , 4 and beyond the temperature range
considered by Bieniek & Green (1983a,b) (for detailed discus-
sion, see Sect. 7.2 of Doel 1990).

We use the Python libraries, NumPy13 (version 1.9.2)
(van der Walt et al. 2011) and SciPy14 (version 0.15.1) (Jones
et al. 2001) in our extrapolation of the SiO collisional rate coef-
ﬁcients and compilation of the molecular dataﬁle. Line overlap-
ping between SiO and H2O transitions, which may signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the pumping of SiO masers (e.g. Desmurs et al. 2014, and
references therein), is neglected.

4.3. Continuum emission

We include the continuum emission in the modelling. In ratran,
however, the ray-tracing code (sky) assumes that the size of the
continuum is much smaller than the pixel size, which is not true
in this ALMA dataset. Hence we cannot include the continuum
by setting the default ratran central parameter, which describes
the radius and blackbody temperature of the central source, in

the straightforward manner. Instead, in our input physical model,
we have created a pseudo-continuum in the innermost three grid
cells of the 1-D input model by setting (1) the outer radius of the
third grid cell to be the physical radius of the radio continuum,
(2) the “kinetic temperature” to be the brightness temperature of
the continuum, (3) the outﬂow velocity to be zero, (4) the turbu-
lence velocity to be 100 km s−1 to get an eﬀectively ﬂat contin-
uum spectrum within the velocity range of interest, and (5) the
molecular abundance to be exceedingly high to get an optically
thick core which blocks all the line emission from behind it. The
exact number of grid cells representing the pseudo-continuum
does not aﬀect the results. The velocity range of the ratran im-
age cubes was selected to be ±25 km s−1 from the systemic ve-
locity, which is the same as for our ALMA image products.

In our modelling, the continuum level and spectral line ab-
sorption/emission were ﬁtted from independent sets of parame-
ters. The radius and eﬀective temperature of the radio continuum
were determined by ﬁtting the modelled continuum levels to the
ones in the observed spectra extracted from the centre, from
32 mas and from 64 mas. Beyond these distances the continuum
level is eﬀectively zero. The derived radius and eﬀective tem-
perature of the pseudo-continuum is Rcontinuum = 3.60 × 1013 cm
(21.8 mas) and 2600 K, respectively. These values are compara-
ble to the mean radii and brightness temperatures of the elliptical
disks ﬁtted by us (Appendix A), by Matthews et al. (2015), and
by Vlemmings et al. (2015).

4.4. Modelling results
In the models of Mira’s extended atmosphere and its inner wind,
power-laws are adopted for the H2 gas density and kinetic tem-
perature proﬁles such that the density and temperature attain
their maximum values at the outer surface of the radio photo-
sphere, Rcontinuum. The proﬁles of the physical parameters are ex-
pressed as functions of the radial distance from the continuum
centre, which is deﬁned as “radius” in the following discussion
and in the plots of the input physical models. In order to repro-
duce the intensity of the spectra extracted from the centre and
diﬀerent projected distances, SiO abundance (relative to molec-
ular hydrogen abundance) has to decrease with radius. We as-
sume a simple two-step function for the SiO abundance, where
the outer abundance is ∼1% of the inner abundance. The radius
at which SiO abundance drops signiﬁcantly is assumed to be
rcond = 1.0 × 1014 cm ≈ 5 R(cid:63) in our preferred model. As we
will discuss in Sect. 5.2.3, the observed spectra can still be ﬁt-
ted if rcond (cid:38) 4 R(cid:63) or if the outer SiO abundance is ∼10% of the
inner value (i.e., a degree of condensation of 90%). The deple-
tion of SiO molecule represents the dust condensation process
in the transition zone between the inner dynamical atmosphere
and the outer, fully accelerated circumstellar envelopes. For the
H2O molecule, however, condensation onto dust grains or solid
ice is not expected in the modelled region where the gas tem-
perature is at least a few hundred Kelvin. Furthermore, in the
non-equilibrium chemical modelling of Gobrecht et al. (2016),
the H2O abundance in the inner winds of the oxygen-rich Mira
variable IK Tau remains roughly constant with radius at a given
stellar pulsation phase. So we assume the H2O abundance (rela-
tive to H2) near Mira to be constant at 5.0 × 10−6 throughout the
modelled region (out to 5.0 × 1014 cm ≈ 25 R(cid:63) ≈ 0(cid:48)(cid:48).3). For the
reason discussed in Section 4.4.1, we have also considered an
alternative H2O abundance proﬁle with a sharp increase in H2O
abundance near the radio photosphere.

In our radiative transfer modelling, the expansion/infall ve-
locity, gas density, and gas kinetic temperature are the crucial

parameters in the input physical model. We have empirically ex-
plored diﬀerent types of proﬁles that are plausible in the inner
winds and circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. To improve
the readability of the article, we present in Appendix E various
plausible models that fail to reproduce the observed spectra. In
this section, we only discuss our preferred model–Model 3–in
which both infall and outﬂow layers coexist in the extended at-
mosphere of Mira. In Sect. 5.3, we compare the velocity, density,
and temperature proﬁles in our preferred model with the those
predicted by current hydrodynamical models of pulsating stel-
lar atmospheres. We also model the line radiative transfer with
the atmospheric structures derived from those hydrodynamical
models.

4.4.1. Preferred model: mixed infall and outﬂow
Our modelling shows that pure infall would produce too much
emission in the blueshifted velocities of the spectra than is ob-
served (Appendix E). The excess emission component, as we
have discussed in Sect. 3.3, originates from the far-side of the
innermost layer (beyond the radio photosphere) of Mira’s ex-
tended atmosphere that is not blocked by the radio continuum
disk. In our preferred model, we introduce a thin expanding layer
(∼5 × 1011 cm ≈ 0.03 R(cid:63)) in the innermost radii between the ra-
dio photosphere and the globally infalling layer. Alternating out-
ﬂow and infall velocity proﬁles have been calculated numerically
by Bowen (1988a,b) for Mira-like variables, and subsequently
adopted by Humphreys et al. (1996, 2001) to simulate the SiO
and H2O masers from a Mira-like M-type variable star at a single
stellar phase. The infall velocity immediately above this expand-
ing layer is about 7.3 km s−1, and the expansion velocity below
this layer is about 4.0 km s−1. The outer infalling gas and the in-
ner expanding layer produce a shocked region, with the shock
velocity of ∆V (cid:46) 12 km s−1, near the radio photosphere of Mira.
The maximum gas infall speed of ∼7 km s−1 is consistent with
the proper motions of SiO maser spots around another oxygen-
rich Mira variable TX Cam, which lie in the velocity range of
5–10 km s−1 (Diamond & Kemball 2003). The emission from
the far-side of the expanding layer would appear at redshifted
velocities and the absorption from the near-side would be in the
blueshifted part (i.e., the usual P Cygni proﬁle). The excess emis-
sion from the pure infall models is therefore reduced to a level
that ﬁts the observed spectra.
To properly ﬁt the line proﬁles, the radius of peak infall ve-
locity is adopted to be 3.75 × 1013 cm, where the gas density is
almost 1013 cm−3. Figure 9 shows the important input parameters
in our model, including the molecular H2 gas density (top-left),
infall velocity (top-right), molecular SiO and H2O abundances
(middle) and the gas kinetic temperature (bottom). The bottom
row of Fig. 9 also shows the excitation temperatures of the SiO
and H2O transitions (in colour).
Figures 10, 11, and 12 show the comparison of our modelled
and observed spectra of SiO  = 0 J = 5−4, SiO  = 2 J = 5−4,
= 55,0 − 64,3, respectively. The top-left
and H2O v2 = 1 JKa,Kc
panel of these ﬁgures show the spectra extracted from the line-
of-sight towards the continuum centre.

The top-right panel of Fig. 10 shows the modelled and ob-
served SiO spectra at 32 mas. In our modelled spectrum, there
is a small absorption feature near the redshifted velocity of
+10 km s−1, which is not seen in the data. This spectral fea-
ture is indeed part of the broad absorption as seen along the
line-of-sight towards the radio continuum, which appears in the
spectra at 32 mas due to beam convolution. Hence, we may have
introduced too much absorption, in particular near the peak in-

fall velocities, to the model. Inhomogeneities in the images may
have introduced additional emission features to the spectra, but
this is not the case here. For example, there is a sharp spike
in the observed spectra extracted from the southern position (in
blue). This feature is due to an intensely emitting SiO clump at
∼26 mas to the south of the continuum centre. The maximum
brightness temperature of this clump in the map is ∼2300 K. The
intense emission from this clump is probably due to maser ac-
tion, because, if it were of thermal nature, then one would also
expect the corresponding 29SiO line to be detected with intense
emission from this clump. However, this clump is too far away
from the other positions from which the spectra were extracted
to contribute signiﬁcant emission. Another possible explanation
is that the infall velocity in our model may decrease too quickly
with radius. For example, at the oﬀset of 64 mas, our modelled
SiO  = 0 spectrum appears to be narrower than the observed
spectra (middle-left panel of Fig. 10). We have tried including
a constant velocity layer of 1013 cm at the peak infall veloc-
ity, but we still could not eliminate the absorption feature near
+10 km s−1. If we adopt a much higher temperature, up to about
2600 K, in the immediate proximity of the radio photosphere,
then we would introduce too much blueshifted emission to the
resultant spectra. Also, our spherically symmetric and homoge-
neous model obviously fails to reproduce the features arising in
individual clumps.

In Fig. 12, we present two diﬀerent models of the H2O spec-
tral ﬁtting using diﬀerent input abundance proﬁles, which are
plotted in the middle-right panel of Fig. 9. As shown in the top-
left panel of Fig. 12, the modelled spectra using constant abun-
dance proﬁle (“Model 3 abundance”; in red) do not ﬁt well to
the observed H2O absorption spectra (in black) along the line-
of-sight towards the continuum centre. In particular, the mod-
elled spectrum does not show the strong observed absorption in
the extreme redshifted velocities > 10 km s−1. Hence, we have
to introduce a sharp rise in the input H2O abundance by about 10
times, to 5.0× 10−5, within the innermost region where the infall
velocity peaks (“High H2O abundance”; in blue) in order to re-
produce the strong redshifted absorption feature in the spectrum.
Overall, considering the complexity of Mira’s extended at-
mosphere and inner wind, we believe that Model 3 can satisfac-
torily reproduce most of the features in the observed SiO and
H2O spectra in ALMA Band 6. We therefore adopt it as our pre-
ferred model and use it as the base model of our further tests in
Section 5.

5. Discussion
5.1. Caveat in the interpretation of the gas density
In our modelling, we assume that the gas in Mira’s extended
atmosphere is composed of purely neutral, molecular hydrogen
(H2) in its rotationally ground state, J = 0. At radii close to the
radio photosphere of evolved stars, atomic hydrogen could be
the dominant species in terms of number density (Glassgold &
Huggins 1983; Doel 1990; Reid & Menten 1997a). Glassgold
& Huggins (1983) have demonstrated that, the atmosphere of
an evolved star with the eﬀective temperature of about 3000 K
would be essentially atomic, and those of a star of about 2000 K
would be essentially molecular. Since the eﬀective temperature
of the star is expected to be higher than the brightness tempera-
ture of the radio photosphere (e.g. Reid & Menten 1997a), there
should be signiﬁcant amount of atomic hydrogen present in the
regions being modelled. In fact, intense hydrogen Balmer series
emission lines have long been detected in the atmosphere of Mira

(e.g. Joy 1926, 1947, 1954; Gillet et al. 1983; Fabas et al. 2011).
The hydrogen emission is thought to be the results of dissocia-
tion and recombination of the atom due to shock waves propa-
gating through the partially ionized hydrogen gas in the atmo-
spheres of Mira variables (e.g. Fox et al. 1984; Fadeyev & Gillet
2004). In addition, molecular hydrogen could well be excited to
higher rotational levels (see our discussion in Appendix D.3).
We note that the collisional rate coeﬃcients between SiO
molecule and atomic hydrogen (H) and electrons (e−) have al-
ready been computed by Palov et al. (2006) and Varambhia et al.
(2009), respectively. However, in this study, we did not attempt
to calculate the fractional distribution of atomic/molecular hy-
drogen, or to consider the collisions between SiO molecule and
atomic hydrogen, helium or electrons. Hence, the derived H2 gas
density from our ratran modelling is just a proxy of the densities
of all possible collisional partners of SiO, including rotationally
excited molecular hydrogen, atomic hydrogen, helium, and even
electrons, in the extended atmosphere of Mira.

In order to examine how well the H2 gas density in our
preferred model is constrained, we have modelled the SiO and
H2O spectra by scaling the gas density by various factors. Fig-
ure 13 shows the results of these sensitivity tests on the input
gas density. We have found that the SiO spectra, extracted from
the line-of-sight towards the centre of the continuum, does not
vary too much, even if the gas density is varied by about an or-
der of magnitude. On the other hand, the H2O spectra extracted
from the centre shows signiﬁcant change in the absorption depth
even if the gas density is changed by a factor of ∼2. Hence, as-
suming other input parameters (particularly the molecular abun-
dances and gas temperature) of Model 3 are ﬁxed, our derived
gas density is tightly constrained. The gas density reaches 1012–
1013 cm−3 just beyond the radio photosphere. This is consistent
with other models that explain the radio continuum ﬂuxes from
Mira’s radio photosphere (Reid & Menten 1997a), and the near-
infrared H2O spectrum (Yamamura et al. 1999). On the other
hand, the derived gas density is much higher (by 2–4 orders of
magnitude) than those predicted from hydrodynamical models
(see Sect. 5.3.3).

5.2. Structure of the extended atmospheres

Our modelling results of the molecular emission and absorption
of SiO and H2O gas allow us to compare the structure of ex-
tended atmosphere of Mira as inferred from previous observa-
tions in various frequencies. We will ﬁrst brieﬂy summarise the
relevant observations of Mira in Sect. 5.2.1, then discuss our in-
terpretation on Mira’s molecular layer in Sect. 5.2.2 and dust
condensation zone in Sect. 5.2.3.

5.2.1. Previous observations

Combining their centimetre-wavelength observations and mil-
limetre/infrared ﬂuxes in the literature, Reid & Menten (1997a)
have demonstrated that long-period variables have a “radio pho-
tosphere” with a radius about twice that of the optical/infrared
photosphere. The latter is determined from the line-free regions
of the optical or infrared spectrum and is deﬁned as the stellar
radius, R(cid:63). In the following discussion, we adopt the value of
R(cid:63) to be 12.3 mas (or 292 R(cid:12)) as determined by Perrin et al.
(2004). The spectral index in the radio wavelengths is found to
be 1.86(≈2), close to the Rayleigh-Jeans law at low frequen-
cies of an optically thick blackbody (Reid & Menten 1997a).
Matthews et al. (2015) and Planesas et al. (2016) found that this

give strong maser emission. Vertical dotted lines mark the radii at which the spectra were extracted; coloured horizontal dotted lines in the bottom
panels indicates the upper-state energy (Eup/k) of the respective transitions. The innermost layer within Rcontinuum represents the grid cells for the
pseudo-continuum, in which the input values for H2 gas density and molecular abundances are above the range of the plots.

infrared photosphere. By ﬁtting to the 11 µm spectrum, Ohnaka
(2004) derived the radii of 1.5 R(cid:63) and 2.2 R(cid:63) for the hot (1800 K)
and cool (1400 K) H2O shells, respectively.

The “radio photosphere” encloses a hot, optically thick
molecular layer (∼2 × 103 K) predominantly emitting in the in-
frared. Observations have revealed that this molecular layer lies
between radii of ∼1 and 2 R(cid:63). Haniﬀ et al. (1995) found that,
for o Cet, the derived radius of the strong TiO absorption near
710 nm with a uniform disk model is about 1.2 ± 0.2 R(cid:63). Perrin
et al. (2004) derived, by ﬁtting a model consisting of an infrared
photosphere and a thin, detached molecular (H2O+CO) layer to
the infrared interferometric data, that the radius of the molecular
layer around o Cet is about 2.07 ± 0.02 R(cid:63). Alternatively, Yama-
mura et al. (1999) have modelled the H2O spectral features in
the near-infrared (∼2–5 µm) spectrum of o Cet with a stack of
superposing plane-parallel layers: the star, an assumed hot SiO
(2000 K) layer, a hot H2O (2000 K), and a cool H2O (1200 K)
layers. Assuming the hot SiO layer has a radius of 2.0 R(cid:63), they
derived the radii of the hot and cool H2O layers to be 2.0 R(cid:63)
and 2.3 R(cid:63), respectively. Ohnaka (2004) employed a more real-
istic model for the extended molecular layer with two contiguous
spherical shells, a hotter and a cooler H2O shells, above the mid-

Beyond the molecular layer and the “radio photosphere”,
there is a ring-like region of SiO maser emission at the radius
between 2 R(cid:63) and 3 R(cid:63). Maser emission naturally arises from
a ring-like structure because the maser requires a suﬃciently
long path length of similar radial velocity in order to be tangen-
tially ampliﬁed to a detectable brightness (Diamond et al. 1994).
Such a SiO maser ring has been imaged in detail at various stel-
lar phases towards the oxygen-rich Mira variable TX Cam (e.g.
Diamond & Kemball 2003; Yi et al. 2005). For o Cet, Reid &
Menten (2007) have directly imaged the radio photosphere and
the SiO J = 1–0 maser emission at 43 GHz and found that the
radii of the radio photosphere and the SiO maser ring are about

rin et al. (2004).

Further out, beyond the SiO maser emission region, dust
grains start to form. The major types of dust around oxygen-
rich AGB stars are corundum (Al2O3) and silicate dust. Us-

Ireland et al. (2004b), Gray et al. (2009) have modelled SiO
maser emission in Mira variables and found that the presence
of Al2O3 dust may either enhance or suppress SiO maser emis-
sion. From interferometric observations of various Mira vari-
ables at near-infrared (2.2 µm), mid-infrared (8–13 µm) and ra-

dio (43 GHz, 7 mm) wavelengths, Perrin et al. (2015) ﬁtted the
visibility data with models similar to Perrin et al. (2004) (stel-
lar photosphere + detached shell of ﬁnite width) and found that
Al2O3 dust predominantly forms between 3 R(cid:63) and 4.5 R(cid:63), while
silicate dust forms in 12 R(cid:63)–16 R(cid:63), which is signiﬁcantly beyond

tion radius derived from previous observations (e.g. Danchi et al.
1994).

5.2.2. Molecular layer

From our visibility analysis (see Appendix A), we determine
the mean radius of the 1.3 mm-photosphere, to be R229 GHz =
22.90 ± 0.05 mas (543 R(cid:12)). This is about 1.9 times the size of
the near-infrared photosphere (R(cid:63) = 12.3 mas; 292 R(cid:12)) as deter-
mined by Perrin et al. (2004). As we have summarised, previous
visibility modelling of near- (2–5 µm) and mid-infrared (11 µm)
interferometric data has suggested the existence of an optically
thick, hot molecular H2O+SiO layer with a maximum radius of
2.3 R(cid:63) (∼30 mas) (Yamamura et al. 1999; Ohnaka 2004). Thus,
this ALMA SV observation has the suﬃcient angular resolution
to resolve the hot molecular layer in the millimetre-wavelength
regime and in addition allows probing its velocity structure.

Modelling the spectral lines of H2O and SiO molecules
at various projected radial distance from the star, we have
determined that the kinetic gas temperature within the mid-
infrared molecular layer (30 mas ∼ 5 × 1013 cm) has to be
about 1400–2100 K. The temperature range is consistent with
those previously modelled by Reid & Menten (1997a) from
their centimetre-wavelength observations of Mira’s radio photo-
sphere, and by Yamamura et al. (1999) and Ohnaka (2004) from
infrared observations using simple models of contiguous, uni-
form molecular H2O+SiO layers.

In our maps, the emission from the vibrationally excited
(Eup/k > 3500 K) SiO  = 2 and H2O v2 = 1 lines has an extent
of (cid:46)100 mas ((cid:46)8 R(cid:63)). The core emission region of the SiO 5–4
 = 0 vibrational ground state line (i.e., excluding the extended
ﬁlamentary or arc-like emission feature to the west/south-west)
that is detected at ≥ 3σ has radii between 200 mas (3.3×1014 cm;
to the south-east) and 600 mas (9.9 × 1014 cm; to the west), and
the size of the half-maximum emission is roughly 100–150 mas
(see Fig. 2). Hence SiO emits rotational emission up to a ra-
dius of ∼50 R(cid:63), far beyond the radius of the molecular layer
probed by infrared interferometers. Perrin et al. (2015), assum-
ing that the mid-infrared N-band visibilities between 7.80 µm
and 9.70 µm as the only signature of gas-phase SiO emission,
concluded that the SiO can only be found in gas phase within
3 R(cid:63). We suggest that this discrepancy is due to the excitation

eﬀect of SiO molecules. The ground state SiO line in the ALMA
SV observation has an energy above the ground of only ∼30 K,
and therefore is excited throughout the region within the silicate
dust condensation zone. While the ALMA images indicate a sig-
niﬁcant amount of gas-phase SiO molecules, the gas temperature
beyond the molecular layer ((cid:46)1000 K) is insuﬃcient to collision-
ally excite the SiO molecules to higher vibrational states. Thus,
the SiO molecule does not produce detectable infrared emission
beyond ∼3 R(cid:63) even if it is abundant there.

5.2.3. Dust shells and the sequence of dust condensation

The radii of dust shells around Mira have been measured with in-
frared interferometry at 11 µm by Danchi et al. (1994) and Lopez
et al. (1997). A single silicate dust shell from 60–2500 mas with
a dust temperature of 1063 K at the inner radius was adopted in
the model of Danchi et al. (1994). Lopez et al. (1997) used a
two-shell model, composed purely of silicate grains, at radii of
50 mas and 200 mas. The dust temperature of the inner radius of
the inner dust shell is about 1160–1380 K. These results suggest
that dust grains start to form around Mira at a temperature above
1000 K and a radius of ∼2–3 R(cid:63), where R(cid:63) was determined to be
19.3–23.6 mas. If we use our adopted value of 12.3 mas for R(cid:63),
then the inner dust formation radius would be ∼4–5 R(cid:63). Com-
pared to the recent model of Perrin et al. (2015), this range is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the silicate formation radii, which is at
least 12 R(cid:63), but is consistent with the radii of corundum forma-
tion.

Studies of silicate dust formation suggest that eﬃcient con-
densation occurs only when the gas temperature drops to be-
low 600 K (e.g. Gail & Sedlmayr 1998). This allows the SiO
gas to emit for a much larger radius in the extended atmosphere
of Mira, as compared to the radii of its dust shells derived previ-
ously and described above. The discussion of higher silicate dust
condensation temperatures has been recently revived by Gail
et al. (2013). Their new measurements of the vapour pressure of
solid SiO suggest that gas-phase SiO molecules may ﬁrst nucle-
ate into SiO clusters, and then condense onto dust grains (Gail
et al. 2013). The gas temperature (assumed to be also the dust
temperature at the inner boundary of the dust shell) at which
SiO gas start to deplete is estimated to be about 600 K, for a
˙M, of ∼10−6 M(cid:12) yr−1, increasing to 800 K for
mass-loss rate,
˙M = 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1. The SiO nucleation process thus allows the

A&A proofs: manuscript no. aa-2015-27867

depletion of SiO gas to begin at a higher gas temperature, i.e.,
at a smaller inner radius, than previously thought. However, the
result of Gail et al. (2013) still cannot explain the high dust tem-
perature (> 1000 K) as derived from visibility ﬁtting by Danchi
et al. (1994) and Lopez et al. (1997).
In our Model 3, the radius at which the 28SiO abundance
decreases signiﬁcantly is adopted to be ∼60 mas, which corre-
sponds to 1.0× 1014 cm or ∼5 R(cid:63). The modelled gas temperature
at this radius is ∼600 K. Besides this SiO abundance proﬁle, we
have also tested with other 2-step functions in order to ﬁnd out
the maximum and minimum amount of SiO molecules, and the
possible range of SiO depletion radii, required to reproduce the
observed ALMA spectra. Figure 14 shows three examples of al-
ternative SiO abundance models. All these models are as good as
our Model 3 in reproducing the spectra. Our experiments show
that, at the very least, the SiO abundance should be ∼1 × 10−6
within ∼4 R(cid:63) and ∼10−8–10−7 beyond that. In other words, SiO
molecules cannot deplete onto dust grains in a signiﬁcant amount
within ∼4 R(cid:63). This radius is consistent with the inner radius of
the silicate dust shells derived in the literature. Our tests, how-
ever, have shown that the synthesised SiO spectra in the outer
radii are not sensitive to a higher value of the SiO abundance,
or the exact shape of the abundance proﬁle. The actual radius
where gas-phase SiO molecule condenses onto dust grains there-
fore may be much further from the star than 4 R(cid:63). Moreover, the
actual degree of SiO gas depletion, through silicate dust con-
densation, nucleation of molecular clusters, or other gas-phase
chemical reactions (e.g. Gail et al. 2013; Gobrecht et al. 2016),
may not be as high as assumed in our preferred model.

The gas temperature at which SiO gas start to deplete in our
models is about 490–600 K, much below the dust temperature at
the inner dust shells as derived observationally by Danchi et al.
(1994) and Lopez et al. (1997). This temperature is also some-
what lower, by about 100 K, than the gas temperature at which
SiO gas starts to nucleate into clusters (Gail et al. 2013). How-
ever, we note that the visibility models derived by Danchi et al.
(1994) and Lopez et al. (1997) have assumed that the dust around
Mira is composed of pure silicate grains. The derived parameters
are therefore based on the adopted optical properties of silicate
dust grains. Other possible compositions of dust grains around
oxygen-rich stars, such as corundum or the mixture of corun-
dum and silicate, cannot be excluded but have not been explored
in those models.
Corundum, the crystalline form of aluminium oxide (Al2O3),
has a high condensation temperature of ∼1700 K (e.g. Grossman
& Larimer 1974; Lorenz-Martins & Pompeia 2000) and is the
most stable aluminium-containing species at a temperature be-
low 1400 K (Gail & Sedlmayr 1998). Little-Marenin & Little
(1990) have classiﬁed the circumstellar dust shells of oxygen-
rich AGB stars into several groups according to the spectral fea-
tures found in their mid-infrared spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). These SED groups show (a) broad emission feature
from 9 to 15 µm, (b) multiple components with peaks near 10,
11.3 and 13 µm, and (c) strong, well-deﬁned characteristic sili-
cate peaks at 9.8 and 18 µm. Little-Marenin & Little (1990) have
also suggested that the circumstellar dust shells follow an evolu-
tionary sequence starting from the class showing the broad fea-
ture, then multiple components and ﬁnally silicate features in
the SED. From a survey of O-rich AGB stars, most of them be-
ing Mira variables, Lorenz-Martins & Pompeia (2000) have suc-
cessfully ﬁtted the SEDs showing (a) broad features, (b) multiple
components (or the intermediate class), and (c) silicate features
and with corundum grains, a mixture of corundum and silicate
grains, and pure silicate grains, respectively. Their results show

Article number, page 20 of 55

that the inner radius of the modelled dust shells increases from
the broad class, the intermediate class, and the silicate class. The
ﬁtted dust temperature of the hottest grains also follows the same
sequence. In addition, they also found that the optical depths of
the corundum-dominated emission are much smaller than those
of the silicate-dominated emission. Lorenz-Martins & Pompeia
(2000) thus concluded that their results were consistent with
the evolutionary sequence suggested by Little-Marenin & Lit-
tle (1990). Corundum grains are the ﬁrst species to form in the
circumstellar dust shells, at a small radius of ∼2–3 R(cid:63) and a tem-
perature of ∼1400–1600 K. At a later stage, silicate grains start to
form and dominate the emission features in the SED. The inner
radius of the silicate dust shells and temperature of the hottest
silicate grains are ∼5–20 R(cid:63) and ∼500–1000 K, respectively.
Our modelling results have shown that gas-phase SiO starts
to deplete at a radius of at least 4 R(cid:63) and a gas temperature
of (cid:46)600 K. In addition, the observed spectra show that SiO
molecules survive in the gas-phase well below 1000 K. This is
apparently inconsistent with the ﬁtting by Danchi et al. (1994)
and Lopez et al. (1997), that the silicate dust shells form at a tem-
perature above 1000 K. We therefore suggest that the inner hot
dust shells around Mira may indeed be composed of other grains
types, possibly corundum, instead of silicate grains as previously
assumed. Although no prominent spectral features of corundum
have been reported (e.g. Lopez et al. 1997; Lobel et al. 2000), we
note that the corundum grains may be coated with silicates when
the temperature becomes low further out in the dust shell (e.g.
Karovicova et al. 2013, Sect. 6.1 and references therein). The
optical depth of pure corundum grains, which only exist close
to the star, may also be much lower than that of silicate grains
(e.g. Lorenz-Martins & Pompeia 2000) and therefore the corun-
dum features may not be easily distinguished in the SED from
the silicate features.

5.2.4. Maser emission
Among all the spectral lines covered in this ALMA SV observa-
tion, only SiO  = 1 J = 5 − 4 and  = 1 J = 2 − 1 (in ALMA
Band 3; not included in this article) exhibit strong maser emis-
sion (Fig. 8). In the images, isolated SiO  = 1 J = 5 − 4 maser
spots are seen outside Mira’s radio photosphere, primarily at the
radial distances between ∼30 and 120 mas from the ﬁtted posi-
tion of the radio continuum. The (relative) spatial distribution of
the SiO  = 1 maser is consistent with those previously reported
by Boboltz & Claussen (2004) and Cotton et al. (2008) (and ref-
erences therein) in other lower-J maser transitions. The presence
of maser emission indicates that the SiO gas in those maser-
emitting spots must not be in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE). In our preferred (1-D and smooth) model, the gas den-
sity is uniformly high throughout the maser-emitting region and
hence all possible maser action is quenched. The predicted exci-
tation temperature does not show any negative values throughout
the modelled region (Fig. 9) and therefore population inversion,
a prerequisite for maser emission to take place, of the SiO  = 1
transition cannot be predicted by our simple model. We note that
our model does not include any external infrared radiation ﬁeld,
in particular the infrared pumping band of SiO molecule near
8.1 µm (∆ = 1, fundamental) and 4.0 µm (∆ = 2, ﬁrst over-
tone). The only input radiation ﬁeld in our model is a blackbody
of 2600 K, representing the radio photosphere of Mira. This tem-
perature is lower than the typical infrared eﬀective temperature
of Mira, which is about 3200 K (Woodruﬀ et al. 2004). So the ra-
diation ﬁeld does not realistically approximate the radiative ex-
citation of SiO molecule to higher vibrational states. Because

abundance proﬁle as in Model 3, which is close to the minimum possible abundance to ﬁt the ALMA spectra. The three other coloured curves are
alternative abundance proﬁles using also 2-step functions. The abundance proﬁle 1 (blue, dashed) has an inner abundance of 1 × 10−6 up to the
radius of ∼6 R(cid:63), and an outer abundance of 1 × 10−7; proﬁle 2 (green, dashed-dotted) has an inner abundance of 8 × 10−7 up to ∼10 R(cid:63), and an
outer abundance of 1 × 10−8; and proﬁle 3 (red, dotted) has an inner abundance of 1 × 10−6 up to ∼4 R(cid:63), and an outer abundance of 1 × 10−7.

our modelling aims to explain the general physical conditions of
Mira’s extended atmosphere, we did not attempt to construct a
sophisticated model to explain both maser and non-maser emis-
sion.

The water line covered in this SV observation, H2O v2 = 1
= 55,0 − 64,3, near 232.7 GHz does not show any maser
JKa,Kc
emission. Gray et al. (2016) have conducted extensive radia-
tive transfer modelling to explore the physical conditions under
which the modelled H2O lines (including all possible lines cov-
ered by ALMA) would exhibit maser emission in the envelopes
of evolved stars. Slab geometry and silicate dust, which is op-
tically thin in the millimetre-wavelengths and optically thick in
the radiative pumping bands of H2O’s vibrational states (e.g., v2
band at 6.27 µm), have been assumed in their modelling (Gray
et al. 2016). The 232.7-GHz H2O emission is seen from the ra-
dio photosphere up to about 80 mas (Fig. 6). Hence, the H2O-
emitting region corresponds to the kinetic temperature of ∼550–
2100 K, the gas density of nH2∼4×1010–1×1013 cm−3, and hence
the H2O molecular density of nH2O∼2 × 105–5 × 107 cm−3 in our
preferred model. Our derived H2O molecular density lies well
within the range in the model of Gray et al. (2016) that is pre-
dicted to exhibit strong maser emission in the 232.7-GHz transi-
tion if the dust temperature is high enough. The absence of the
232.7-GHz H2O maser is consistent with a (silicate-type) dust
temperature lower than approximately 900, 1000, and 1600 K
for the respective gas kinetic temperature of about 500, 1000,
and 1500 K (see Fig. 10 of Gray et al. 2016). These comparisons,
although not a conclusive proof, suggest that hot dust grains that
are optically thick at the v2 band (6.27 µm) did not exist in Mira’s
extended atmosphere during the ALMA SV observation.

5.3. Comparison with current hydrodynamic models

5.3.1. Early hydrodynamic models for stellar pulsation

There are many numerical hydrodynamical calculations on Mira
variables to simulate the variation of pulsation velocity, num-
ber density, kinetic temperature as functions of the stellar phase
and/or radial distance from the star. Pioneering work includes the
studies of Willson & Hill (1979), Hill & Willson (1979), Wood
(1979), Willson (1987), and Beach et al. (1988) and Bowen
(1988a,b, 1989) (hereafter, Bowen’s models). Wood (1979),
Willson (1987), and Bowen (1988a,b, 1989) have compared the
eﬀect of radiation pressure on dust on the mass-loss rate and the
velocities of the stellar outﬂows. The outﬂow/infall velocity pro-
ﬁles as a function of radius as derived from these models are
qualitatively similar. These authors all predict alternating out-
ﬂow and infall layers in close proximity to the star, within about
4–6× 1013 cm. Beyond that radius, the dust-driven winds exhibit
accelerating outﬂow. In the region where material expands and
falls back, large-scale shocks are produced at the interface be-
tween the outer, infall layer and the inner outﬂow.

Infall motions in the extended atmosphere of the star can be
observed as inverse P Cygni proﬁles in the spectra. The material
at the near side of the star will show redshifted absorption and the
material at the far side that is not blocked by the continuum will
show blueshifted emission. These emission features are present
even if there is no hot material (perhaps shock-heated) with a
temperature higher than the continuum brightness temperature,
and are also known as the “nebular” eﬀect (e.g. Bessell et al.
1996; Scholz & Wood 2000), in which the large volume of the
highly extended atmosphere, albeit only weakly emitting per unit
volume, adds up to produce signiﬁcant emission. For example,
the redshifted absorption in the CO second overtone (∆ = 3)
lines from o Cet indicates infall motions in the deep photospheric

layers of the star (Hinkle et al. 1984). Results from the early
spectroscopy by Joy (1926, 1954) also suggest infall motion in
the extended atmosphere of o Cet, based on modern information
on the systemic (centre-of-mass) velocity of the star (see also the
interpretation by Gabovitš 1936).

Bowen’s models have been adopted by Humphreys et al.
(1996) and Humphreys et al. (2001) to simulate the SiO ( = 1
and 2) and H2O (ground state and v2 = 1) masers from a tem-
plate M-type Mira (parameters were based on o Cet) at a single
stellar phase, and by Gray & Humphreys (2000) and Humphreys
et al. (2002) to simulate the variability of SiO ( = 1) masers at
various epochs of a stellar cycle of the model Mira. Gray et al.
(2009) have comprehensively reviewed the success and limita-
tions of these precursor models for SiO maser simulations. One
major drawback of Bowen’s hydrodynamical solutions is that the
pulsation phase in the model (with phase 0 deﬁned as the mo-
ment when the inner boundary of the model atmosphere, or the
“piston”, is moving outwards at the maximum speed) is discon-
nected from the stellar phase as determined from the optical or
infrared brightness variations (Humphreys et al. 1996). In ad-
dition, the assumption of a constant infrared radiation ﬁeld by
dust and the stellar photosphere was also too simplistic for Mira
variables (Gray et al. 2009).

Solving the hydrodynamical equations as presented in Richt-
myer & Morton (1967, Chap. 12), who adopt the von Neumann-
Richtmyer pseudo-viscosity method as the artiﬁcial shock dissi-
pation mechanism (von Neumann & Richtmyer 1950), the au-
thors of early hydrodynamic models have derived the dynamical
structures around Mira-like variables. Bowen’s models consid-
ered also the thermal relaxation of shocks via radiative cooling
from neutral hydrogen atoms at high temperatures ((cid:38)6000 K)
and from other species (which is represented by an assumed
cooling coeﬃcient) at low temperatures (see Sects. II(b) and
II(c)(iii) of Bowen 1988a). Bowen’s models predicted the exis-
tence of an extended (∼1014 cm) post-shock region of elevated
gas temperatures (∼10 000 K) near the optical/infrared photo-
sphere.

On the other hand, using the hydrogen Balmer series emis-
sion lines as the signatures of shock-heated region, Fox et al.
(1984) and Fox & Wood (1985) developed a theoretical model of
shock waves in the atmosphere of Mira variables and predicted
that these pulsation-driven shocks dissipate within a very thin
region in the extended atmospheres, of a several orders of mag-
nitude smaller extent than the stellar radius (i.e., (cid:28) 1012 cm).
The circumstellar shock models by Willacy & Cherchneﬀ (1998)
and Gobrecht et al. (2016) predict that the cooling length of
H2 dissociation, depending on the shock velocities, is typically
< 108 cm. The very narrow post-shock region suggests that
the relaxation of the shocked material towards radiative equi-
librium and local thermodynamic equilibrium is essentially in-
stantaneous and therefore the post-shock heating might be ne-
glected. Woitke et al. (1996) argued that Bowen’s cooling rate
was underestimated by a few orders of magnitude, thus resulting
in an atmosphere with highly elevated gas temperature. Further-
more, based on the observational constraints from Mira’s radio
continuum emission at 8 GHz, Reid & Menten (1997a,b) have
shown that the amplitude of gas temperature disturbance, prob-
ably due to shocks or pulsations, can only be about 300 K (as-
suming a shock propagation speed of 7.3 km s−1). These are in
contrast with Bowen’s non-equilibrium models which expect a
rather extended shock-heated region with highly elevated gas
temperature. Bessell et al. (1989) have compared the synthe-
sised spectra from Bowen’s non-equilibrium model with the ob-
served spectrum between 600 nm and 4 µm, and found that they

Article number, page 22 of 55

did not match at all. Moreover, the hydrogen spectra (e.g., Hα)
predicted by Luttermoser & Bowen (1990, 1992) using Bowen’s
model were much broader, and have diﬀerent line proﬁles, than
what was actually observed (Woodsworth 1995). Hence, the
non-equilibrium models with extended high-temperature regions
are not suitable for the extended atmospheres of Mira variables
(see also the discussions in Woitke 1998; Willson 2000).

For the purpose of veriﬁcation, we have also conducted sim-
ilar tests to Bessell et al. (1989) by introducing to our preferred
model (Model 3) an arbitrary extended layer ((cid:38)1012 cm) of ele-
vated gas temperature (∼4000 K) at various radial distances from
Mira. The elevated temperature is signiﬁcantly higher than the
brightness temperature of the stellar radio continuum (∼2600 K).
Figure 15 shows an example of our tests. Even though the
gas temperature is elevated for just a relatively thin layer (2 ×
1013 cm ∼ R(cid:63)) as compared to Bowen’s non-equilibrium model
(∼1014 cm), the synthesised spectra exhibit very strong emission
features that are absent in the data. In fact, if we further extend
the zone of elevated gas temperature, the emission spikes only
become more prominent. Therefore our tests suggest that during
this particular ALMA SV observation, the extended atmosphere
of Mira did not contain any extended ((cid:38)1012 cm) shock-heated
(above the brightness temperature of the radio continuum) re-
gion as predicted from the non-equilibrium model. This is con-
sistent with those shock wave models that suggest that the shock
relaxation in Mira atmosphere takes place within a very thin
zone compared to the stellar radius (e.g. Fox et al. 1984; Fox
& Wood 1985). In addition, we do not expect the existence of
stellar chromosphere, as suggested to explain the Hα absorption
lines from some semi-regular variables (Luttermoser et al. 1994;
Wood et al. 2004), beyond the radio photosphere of Mira during
this ALMA SV observation. Indeed, a stellar chromosphere may
not exist around Mira at all because the Hα line from the star has
only been seen in emission, not absorption (e.g. Joy 1947; Gillet
et al. 1983, 1985).

5.3.2. More recent hydrodynamic models
Based on the assumption of negligible post-shock heating,
Bessell et al. (1996) and Hofmann et al. (1998) have made series
of pulsation models to theoretically calculate the photospheric
structure (e.g., density, temperature, outﬂow/infall velocities) of
Mira variables. Applying the predictions from these model se-
ries, Bessell et al. (1996) and Scholz & Wood (2000) have pre-
dicted the near-infrared spectra of selected atomic and molecular
lines, which exhibit both the normal and inverse P Cygni proﬁles,
and show signiﬁcant variations with the stellar phase.

New hydrodynamical solutions have also been derived by
Ireland et al. (2004a,b) and adopted by Gray et al. (2009) to sim-
ulate SiO maser emission in Mira variables. The model series
are based on self-excited pulsation as in Hofmann et al. (1998),
instead of “piston”-generated pulsation in other hydrodynamical
models. Simulations have shown that SiO masers would form
a ring of typically ∼2.2 R(cid:63) around the star (Gray et al. 2009),
which is close to but beyond the radius of the radio photosphere.
The results are consistent with the previous observations of SiO
maser shells around Mira by Reid & Menten (1997a, 2007).
Hence, strong SiO masers within the radio photosphere are pro-
hibited (Reid & Menten 1997a; Gray et al. 2009). Comparing
the hydrodynamical solutions of Ireland et al. (2004a,b) with
observations, the strongest inner shocks (with ∆V > 20 km s−1)
are enclosed within the radio photosphere, and the shocks be-
yond that only cause a velocity change of ∼7 km s−1. The low
shock velocity beyond the radio continuum is also consistent

with the proper motion velocities of SiO masers observed in TX
Cam (Diamond & Kemball 2003) and the nearly constant radio
light curves observed in several Mira variables (Reid & Menten
1997a,b). In addition, Gray et al. (2009) have found that the pres-
ence of corundum (Al2O3) dust grains can both enhance or sup-
press SiO maser emission.

More recently, Ireland et al. (2008, 2011) and Scholz et al.
(2014) have developed the Cool Opacity-sampling Dynamic EX-
tended (codex) atmosphere models, based on an improved self-
excited pulsation code by Keller & Wood (2006) to determine
the pressure and luminosity, and an opacity-sampling method to
derive the gas and dust temperatures (see, also, the review by
Ireland 2011). The mass density and velocity proﬁles in the ex-
tended atmosphere can also be computed. Thus far, the codex
models have only been compared to the spectro-interferometric
and spectro-photometric observations of Mira variables in the in-
frared wavelengths (e.g. Woodruﬀ et al. 2009; Wittkowski et al.
2011; Hillen et al. 2012). Our radiative transfer modelling of
the submillimetre molecular transitions from Mira as observed
by the ALMA long baselines, including the vibrational ground
state lines that are less aﬀected by excitation eﬀects, can pro-
vide an alternative probe to the detailed physical conditions in
Mira’s extended atmosphere at a spatial scale of a few R(cid:63). We
will present in Sects. 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 our modelling results using
the predicted atmospheric structures from codex and alternative
velocity proﬁles in Mira’s extended atmosphere.

5.3.3. Kinematics

As described above, our high angular-resolution ALMA long
baseline data clearly resolve the line emission/absorption from
the extended atmosphere of Mira. Employing radiative trans-
fer modelling we can test the atmospheric structures predicted
by the latest hydrodynamical models. In particular, we consider
the hydrodynamical model series, codex, developed by Ireland
et al. (2008, 2011) and Scholz et al. (2014). We use the o54
5400 L(cid:12) model series, which is based on the stellar parameters
of our target source, Mira (o Cet). From the codex developers
we have obtained the atmospheric structure information of the
o54 model series, including the total mass density, kinetic tem-
perature (which is not the computed non-grey equilibrium tem-
perature in the ﬁnal model atmospheres, see Ireland et al. 2008),
and the radial expansion or infall velocity of the gas at diﬀer-
ent radii. Among the 6 complete stellar pulsation cycles com-
puted by the developers, the models at the stellar phases closest

to this 2014 ALMA SV dataset (near phase 0.45) are models
25042015 (phase 0.38), 261740 (0.40), 286060 (0.41), 287880
(0.40), 289440 (0.40), and 291820 (0.41) (Ireland et al. 2008,
2011).

Because of the assumption of instantaneous shock dissipa-
tion, there is no extended zone of elevated gas kinetic temper-
ature above the stellar brightness temperature in the extended
atmosphere. The gas temperature proﬁles of the codex models
are, respectively, lower than (by < 500 K) and higher than (by
< 700 K) than what we have empirically derived in Sect. 4.4
for the inner radii ((cid:46)5 × 1013 cm ≈ 2.5 R(cid:63)) and outer radii. The
temperature in Mira’s extended atmosphere is always < 2000 K,
except at radii very close to the radio continuum.

The codex code computes the mass density of all particles in
the atmosphere. In our ratran input models, we convert the mass
density to number density by division with the average mass of
+ 0.3mHe = 4.3372 ×
the particles in the wind, mpart = 0.7mH2
10−24 g, assuming the typical helium mass fraction of Y ≈ 0.3
(e.g. Wood & Cahn 1977; Lattanzio & Wood 2003; Ireland et al.
2008; Ventura et al. 2013). In our modelling, however, we only
consider the collision of H2O and SiO with rotational ground-
state H2 molecules only.

However, if we apply this conversion to the input models,
the number density in Mira’s extended atmosphere will be about
108–1010 cm−3, which is too low to excite the molecules and
to produce signiﬁcant emission or absorption in the synthesised
spectra. The deep absorption features observed towards the con-
tinuum disk and the emission proﬁles towards various radial dis-
tances from the star can only be reproduced by arbitrarily in-
creasing the converted number density by a large factor. In our
modelling, therefore, we scale the number density of all codex
models by a factor of 104 such that the density outside the radio
photosphere reaches at least 1012 cm−3. This density is similar
to the one adopted in our empirical modelling (Sect. 4), and is
also consistent with that derived by Reid & Menten (1997a), who
modelled the centimetre-wavelength radio ﬂuxes from the radio

15 These model numbers correspond to various phases of the models
in the o54 series in chronological order. Models 248480–251160 are
the models in the compact atmospheric cycles, during which most of
the mass in the model atmosphere is contained within a relatively small
radial extent; models 260820–263740 are those in the extended atmo-
spheric cycles; and models 285180–291860 cover almost four consec-
utive pulsation cycles of the model atmosphere, with intermediate ex-
tents of the mass-zones (see Fig. 1 and Tables 2, 3, and 4 of Ireland et al.
2011).

photospheres of Mira variables (including Mira). Furthermore,
the density is also compatible with the lower limit of 1011 cm−3,
which is estimated by modelling the near-infrared H2O spectrum
and assuming a relatively high H2O abundance of ∼3×10−4 (Ya-
mamura et al. 1999). If the adopted H2O abundance is similar to
our assumed value of ∼10−5, then the lower limit of the gas den-
sity derived by Yamamura et al. (1999) would also be close to
the values in our modelling. We, however, note that the gas den-
sity should be interpreted with caution – see our discussion in
Sect. 5.1.

In our initial test, we have replaced our preferred model
(Model 3) with the codex-predicted gas number density (scaled
by 104), kinetic temperature and radial velocity proﬁles. All
other parameters, namely the SiO abundance proﬁle, the local
velocity dispersion, and the radio continuum are the same as
Model 3. The outer radius of our model is greater than the outer
boundaries of the codex models. The outer boundaries depend
on individual codex models. For each model, we extrapolate the
number density and kinetic temperature in power-laws near the
outer boundary, i.e., linear extrapolation in log-log relation. We
also assume that the infall or expansion velocity at and beyond
the codex model boundary to be constant because we have no
information of the kinematics beyond that. Since the gas density
and molecular SiO abundance are usually very low to cause sig-
niﬁcant excitation in the outer regions, the precise extrapolation
method has little eﬀect on the synthesised spectra.

Figure 16 shows the results of our initial test of the velocity
proﬁles from these 6 codex models. Remarkably, all the 6 models
near the observed stellar phase are able to qualitatively reproduce
the general spectral features, including (1) the strong absorption
proﬁle in the line-of-sight towards the radio continuum of Mira,
and (2) gradually decreasing emission ﬂux and line width in
the lines-of-sight towards increasing radial oﬀsets from the star.
Closer inspection reveals that all the 6 codex models produce an
extra high-velocity absorption wings in either the redshifted or
blueshifted parts of the spectra towards the centre of the contin-
uum. The velocities of the absorption wings correspond to the
high-velocity gas at 10–20 km s−1 near the radio continuum of
Mira, i.e., 3.6 × 1013 cm (1.8 R(cid:63)). Because there is no sign of
any absorption wings broader than ±10 km s−1 in the observed
spectra, the strong velocity variation as seen in these models, in
particular models 261740, 286060, 287880, and 289440, cannot
explain the speciﬁc atmosphere structure of Mira during the time
of the 2014 ALMA SV observation.

The velocity proﬁles of codex models 250420 and 291820
are qualitatively similar to our Model 3 (see Fig. 9, top-right
panel). First, the extended atmosphere exhibits slowly varying,
infall motion over a large range of radii. Second, there is a sharp
change in velocity, representing a strong shock front, with ∆V (cid:38)
10 km s−1 just outside the radio continuum (3.60× 1013cm). The
strong shock front in model 250420 is located at 3.64 × 1013cm
and that in model 291820 is at 3.83×1013cm (Ireland et al. 2011).
In our second test, we increase the radius of our radio pseudo-
continuum to engulf the strong shock fronts in models 250420
and 291820. Figure 17 shows the modelled spectra as a result
of hiding the strong shock fronts. The high-velocity absorption
wings in the blueshifted part of the SiO spectra extracted from
the continuum centre has disappeared, and hence the synthesised
spectra can now better ﬁt the observed ALMA spectra. We there-
fore conclude that, at the time of the 2014 ALMA SV observa-
tion (stellar phase ∼0.45), there does not exist any strong shock
with a high velocity of ∆V (cid:38) 20 km s−1 in the extended atmo-
sphere of Mira beyond the radius of its 229-GHz radio photo-
sphere. Furthermore, the infall and outﬂow velocities of the gas

Article number, page 24 of 55

beyond the radio photosphere of Mira are bounded by ∼7 km s−1
and ∼4 km s−1, respectively.

Our ﬁnding is consistent with previous observations of SiO
maser emission from other oxygen-rich Mira variables. For ex-
ample, Wittkowski et al. (2007) found that the expansion ve-
locity of the SiO maser-emitting shell around S Ori is about
10 km s−1 by ﬁtting the projected radii of the maser spots and
their line-of-sight velocities; Diamond & Kemball (2003) also
found that the infall velocities of the SiO maser emission around
TX Cam range from 5–10 km s−1 by tracing the proper motions
of the maser spots. In fact, based on their shock damping model,
Reid & Menten (1997b) have excluded the shock propagation
velocities signiﬁcantly (by a few km s−1) higher than 7 km s−1
in order to explain the multi-epoch radio ﬂux variation of Mira at
8 GHz, assuming that the amplitude of temperature disturbance
due to shocks is (cid:38)300 K or the factor of density compression is
(cid:38)2. Hence, any gas infall or outﬂow motion with speed above
10 km s−1 is unlikely beyond the radio photosphere of Mira,
and therefore the very high-velocity shocks of ∆V (cid:38) 20 km s−1
as predicted by the codex models, in particular models 285180
(phase 0.80) and 287980 (phase 0.61) in the same o54 model
series (Ireland et al. 2011), are not expected.

The above exercises have demonstrated that the atmospheric
structures predicted by the codex models can qualitatively re-
produce the general spectral features of the molecular transi-
tions originating from the extended atmospheres and the inner
wind of Mira. As already suggested by the authors of codex, the
derived structures of the model atmosphere, such as the stellar
radius, mass density, gas temperature, and velocity, exhibit sig-
niﬁcant cycle-to-cycle variations and appear to be chaotic (Ire-
land et al. 2011; Ireland 2011). The combination of the expan-
sion/infall velocity proﬁle and the locations of shock fronts are
diﬀerent in each cycle. It may take tens of stellar cycles (over
a decade) for similar atmospheric structures to reappear (e.g.
Fig. 1 of Ireland et al. 2011). We therefore expect that the radio
and (sub)millimetre spectra of the molecular transitions would
also exhibit signiﬁcant cycle-to-cycle variation, in addition to
rapid variation within a single cycle. Long-term (multi-cycle and
multi-epoch) monitoring of Mira variables with the ALMA long
baseline is therefore necessary to fully test the predictions from
hydrodynamical models, especially the amplitudes of pulsation-
driven shocks above the radio photospheres of these stars.

5.3.4. Wind acceleration
Höfner et al. (2003) also developed models of the dynamical at-
mospheres by solving time-dependent dynamic equations and
frequency-dependent radiative transfer equations (i.e. non-grey
dynamical model), including a time-dependent description of
dust formation for carbon-rich atmospheres (see, also, the review
by Höfner 2015). Based on Höfner’s hydrodynamical model,
Gautschy-Loidl et al. (2004) were able to reproduce the in-
frared spectra of carbon-rich stars in the wavelength range of
0.5–25 µm, observed at various stellar phases, with a single con-
sistent model atmosphere for each star. Nowotny et al. (2005a,b,
2010) have also compared the synthesised spectra of CO and CN
in the infrared wavelengths with the observed spectra of carbon-
rich stars and found that the general line proﬁles and radial ve-
locities of the observed photospheric lines can be explained by
the model atmospheres derived from the hydrodynamical code of
Höfner et al. (2003). On the other hand, in the case of oxygen-
rich model atmospheres, Höfner et al. (2003) adopted a sim-
ple parametrised description for the dust opacity as in Eq. (5)
of Bowen (1988a). If non-grey radiative transfer was consid-

Fig. 17. Similar to Fig. 16, except that the radius of the pseudo-continuum in the model, Rcontinuum is changed to 3.65 × 1013cm for model 250420
(left column) and 3.85 × 1013cm for model 291820 (right column). The modelled continuum levels are therefore slightly higher than the ones
adopting Rcontinuum = 3.60× 1013cm. The strong shock fronts predicted in these two models are hidden inside the radio continuum. The middle and
bottom rows show the selected resultant SiO spectra from the corresponding models.

ered in the dynamical models, however, there would be too little
radiative pressure to drive the winds in oxygen-rich stars (e.g.
Woitke 2006; Höfner & Andersen 2007). Both Woitke (2006)
and Höfner (2007) have concluded that the iron content of the
wind-driving dust grains must be low, otherwise the dust con-
densation radius would be too far away from the star (> 10 R(cid:63))
and hence dust-driven winds could not form. Höfner & Ander-
sen (2007) have considered the possibility that the winds be-
ing driven by a small amount of carbon-bearing grains in the
oxygen-rich atmospheres. By varying the grain properties in
their dynamical models, Höfner (2008) has predicted that the

size of the wind-driving (iron-free) grains must be in the nar-
row range between 0.1 and 10 µm. Scicluna et al. (2015) have
reported the detection of large grains with an average size of
∼0.5 µm in the oxygen-rich circumstellar envelope of the red su-
pergiant (RSG) VY Canis Majoris based on optical polarimetric
imaging. However, the implication of their results on AGB stars,
which are the low-mass counterparts of RSGs, is unclear. In con-
trast, Ireland et al. (2011) and Ireland (2011) have found that
both large iron-poor grains and small (< 70 nm) iron-rich grains
may drive the winds in oxygen-rich atmospheres, although the

material still has to be lifted to a radius of at least 3–5 R(cid:63), where
dust grains start to condensate eﬃciently.

One notable diﬀerence between the results of the codex code
and that developed by Höfner is that codex models exhibit large-
scale velocity variations at radii up to ∼10 R(cid:63), while the mod-
els based on Höfner’s code only show large-scale velocity vari-
ation of ∆V > 10 km s−1 within ∼2–3 R(cid:63). In Höfner’s model
atmospheres, the winds are eﬃciently accelerated by (Fe-free)
dust grains that condense at ∼3 R(cid:63) (e.g. Höfner 2009, 2015) and
therefore the velocity proﬁle becomes a generally continuous
outﬂow with small-amplitude pulsation (∆V (cid:46) 2 km s−1) due to
previous shock episodes (e.g. Höfner et al. 2003; Nowotny et al.
2005a, 2010).
We have conducted another test to examine whether large-
scale velocity variations of ∆V∼5 km s−1 at a large radial dis-
tance ∼10 R(cid:63) from the star are possible. Instead of employ-
ing Höfner’s model atmospheres directly, we have constructed
a model nearly identical to our preferred Model 3 with a mod-
iﬁed input velocity proﬁle. Figure 18 shows the results of this
test. The model on the left column presents the input velocity
proﬁle (top panel), the modelled and observed SiO  = 0 (mid-
dle) and SiO  = 2 (bottom) spectra of Model 3 for comparison.
The model on the right column shows the input and results of
the alternative velocity variation. This alternative model exhibits
signiﬁcant increase in the infall velocity, with ∆V ≈ 6 km s−1
at ∼9 R(cid:63), which can only be seen in Ireland’s codex atmospheres
but not in Höfner’s. As long as the infall velocity does not exceed
∼5 km s−1, the modelled spectra would not show signiﬁcant dif-
ference regardless of the radial distance where the gas from the
extra shock episode is located. Based on the molecular spectra
of Mira at this particular stellar phase alone, we can neither dis-
tinguish whether such an extra episode of shocked gas exists at
all nor determine its possible distance from the star. On the other
hand, our test concerning the SiO molecular abundance in Sect.
5.2.3 shows that the radius at which SiO starts to condense onto
dust grains is at least 4 R(cid:63). This suggests that the actual wind
acceleration may occur beyond ∼4 R(cid:63) and hence some velocity
variations could still be possible beyond ∼2–3 R(cid:63).

6. Conclusions
1. With the long ALMA baselines of ∼15 km, we are now able
to probe the physical conditions in the extended atmospheres
and the inner winds (within the dust condensation zone) of
AGB stars in unprecedented detail. Mira (o Cet) has been
observed as a Science Veriﬁcation target in the 2014 ALMA
Long Baseline Campaign. The angular resolution of the long
baseline is ∼30 mas at 220 GHz, which is high enough to re-
solve the radio continuum of Mira. For the ﬁrst time, spec-
tral line absorption against the stellar radio continuum has
been clearly imaged in the millimetre wavelengths (1.3 mm)
in the transitions of SiO  = 0, 1, 2 J = 5− 4 and H2O v2 = 1
JKa,Kc
2. Through radiative transfer modelling, we are able to recon-
struct the detailed physical conditions of Mira’s extended at-
mosphere, namely the gas density, kinetic temperature, abun-
dance of SiO and H2O molecules, and the expansion/infall
velocity as functions of radial distance from the star. We ﬁt
the SiO and H2O spectra along the lines-of-sight towards
the stellar continuum, and towards positions at various sky-
projected radii and position angles from the star. In our pre-
ferred model which successfully reproduces the spectra of
SiO  = 0, 2 and H2O v2 = 1, the extended atmosphere shows
infall motion in general. A shock of velocity ∆V ∼ 12 km s−1

= 55,0 − 64,3.

is found above Mira’s 229 GHz radio photosphere. The SiO
abundance drops signiﬁcantly from 1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−8–
1 × 10−7 at the radius of about 1.0 × 1014 cm = 5 R(cid:63), where
R(cid:63) = 12.3 mas = 292 R(cid:12) is our adopted radius of Mira’s
infrared photosphere. However, we have also shown that the
SiO depletion radius may indeed be anywhere from 4 R(cid:63) out-
wards. In addition, the H2O spectra may be better ﬁtted by
adopting an abundance distribution that show a sharp rise in
abundance (by about 10 times) near the radio photosphere.

3. We have also tested the predictions from current hydrody-
namical models, in particular the codex model series that are
tailored for Mira. We have used the predicted atmospheric
structures as the inputs of our line radiative transfer mod-
elling. The models successfully reproduce, qualitatively, the
absorption features against the continuum. After ﬁne-tuning
the radial distances and the magnitudes of the major shock
front(s), which are chaotic in nature, the synthesised spec-
tra from the codex models can then reasonably well-ﬁt the
observed spectra in this SV observation. Considering the
chaotic nature of Mira’s extended atmosphere, the modelled
spectra from codex’s atmospheres ﬁt remarkably well to the
observed ALMA spectra. In addition, we also demonstrated
that some other models of Mira’s circumstellar environment
(e.g. the presence of a chromosphere) do not have support in
this ALMA data.

4. We have carried out model ﬁtting of Mira’s radio contin-
uum emission at 229.6 GHz and compared with two other
independent results published in mid-2015. Our continuum
models for Mira A and B are consistent with those ﬁtted
by Matthews et al. (2015). The single uniform disk model
for Mira A is consistent with a radio photosphere with a
brightness temperature of 2611 ± 51 K. On the other hand,
we have not found any sign of a compact (∼4.7 mas) hotspot
(Tb ∼ 10 000 K) in Mira A’s continuum as suggested by
Vlemmings et al. (2015), even though we have adopted es-
sentially the identical ﬁtting procedure as them and cross-
checked with another visibility ﬁtting software.

5. The long ALMA baselines have demonstrated its capabil-
ity to produce high-angular resolution and high-sensitivity
spectral line images in the extended atmospheres of evolved
stars. In order to test the validity of current hydrodynamical
models and address the long-standing puzzle of dust conden-
sation and wind-driving mechanism in oxygen-rich evolved
stars, long-term (multi-cycle and multi-epoch) monitoring of
Mira variables and AGB stars are necessary.

(Canada) and NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (Republic of Korea), in
cooperation with the Republic of Chile. The Joint ALMA Observatory is oper-
ated by ESO, AUI/NRAO and NAOJ. We thank M. Scholz, M. J. Ireland and
P. R. Wood for kindly providing their model atmospheres from the o54 series of
the Cool Opacity-sampling Dynamic EXtended (codex) atmosphere model. We
thank M. J. Reid for a careful reading of the manuscript and for his highly use-
ful comments. We also thank the anonymous referee, L. D. Matthews, and E. W.
Greisen for their insightful comments and suggestions, which have inspired some
of our tests to address the imaging issues. We acknowledge with thanks the vari-
able star observations from the AAVSO International Database contributed by
observers worldwide and used in this research. This research has made use of
NASA’s Astrophysics Data System Bibliographic Services. This research has
made use of the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France. Py-
FITS is a product of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by
AURA for NASA. K. T. Wong was supported for this research through a stipend
from the International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astronomy
and Astrophysics at the Universities of Bonn and Cologne and also by the Bonn-
Cologne Graduate School of Physics and Astronomy (BCGS). K. T. Wong also
acknowledges the BCGS Honors Budget which covers the digitisation cost of
the Ph.D. thesis of R. C. Doel.

Fig. 18. The input radial velocity proﬁle (top row) and the modelled SiO (middle and bottom rows) spectra of two nearly identical models, except
that for the model on the left, there is only one large-scale velocity variation close to the radio continuum, while for the model on the right, there
is an additional strong velocity variation near 1.8 × 1014 cm = 109 mas ∼ 5 R(cid:63).

θmajθmin = 7.6 × 1013 cm) and S 229.6 GHz = 92 ± 30 mJy, re-
spectively, and those of the additional Gaussian component are
26.0 mas×23.9 mas (d = 4.1×1013 cm) and S 229.6 GHz = 59 mJy,
respectively. However, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results have been
reported by Vlemmings et al. (2015). The elliptical disk compo-
nent ﬁtted by Vlemmings et al. (2015) has a size of ∼43.4 mas ×
38.5 mas (d = 6.7 × 1013 cm) and a ﬂux density of S 229.6 GHz =
139±0.2 mJy, while the additional Gaussian, which was assumed
circular in their model, has d = 4.7 mas (0.8 × 1013 cm) and
S 229.6 GHz = 9.6 ± 0.1 mJy. At 229.6 GHz, the brightness tem-
perature of the 4.7-mas Gaussian component is approximately
10 000 K (Vlemmings et al. 2015), which is much higher than
that of the uniform elliptical disk component of Mira A. Vlem-
mings et al. (2015) therefore argue the existence of a hotspot, or

a cluster of unresolved spots, and speculate that its origin may
be connected to the stellar magnetic activity of Mira A.

We have also conducted similar continuum analysis of the
Mira AB system in ALMA Band 6. Apart from the data in
the continuum windows of this SV dataset (spw = 0, 7; at
229.6 GHz) as already analysed by Matthews et al. and Vlem-
mings et al., we also include the continuum data from the six
spectral line windows (spw = 1–6 and 8–13). The continuum
data in these spectral line windows were prepared by averag-
ing and splitting out the line-free channels in the windows cor-
responding to each distinct frequency range (see the ﬁrst two
columns of Table A.1), and then exporting the visibility data to
Miriad. The visibilities of Mira A and B were ﬁtted simultane-
ously using the similar model adopted by Matthews et al. (2015)
and Vlemmings et al. (2015), i.e., a uniform disk plus an ad-
ditional Gaussian component for Mira A, and a single Gaussian
model for Mira B. We ﬁt the visibilities with the task uvfit (Re-
vision 1.10, 2013 August) in Miriad. Miriad/uvfit is preferred
to the uvmodelfit task in CASA because it allows multiple
model components to be ﬁtted simultaneously. We have cross-
checked the uv-ﬁtting results from the respective tasks in Miriad
and CASA with single-component models, and both tasks re-
turn similar results. To compare the results of Matthews et al.
(2015) and Vlemmings et al. (2015), the visibilities of the 229-
GHz continuum windows (spw = 0, 7) have been ﬁtted in the
similar manner.

Table A.1 shows the uv-ﬁtting results to the continuum data
in the ascending order of the range of rest frequencies. For Mira
A, whilst the major and minor axes of the elliptical compo-
nents appear to be consistent among all spectral windows, the
ﬂuxes shared by the uniform disk and the Gaussian component
show great variation. The formal errors of the ﬂuxes reported by
uvfit are ∼9 mJy for the continuum window and 35–40 mJy for
the six spectral line windows. Hence, the ﬁtted ﬂuxes of the in-
dividual components of Mira A in the line windows are not as
reliable as those in the continuum window at 229.6 GHz. Fig-
ures A.1 and A.2 show the visibility plots and the maps, re-
spectively, of the ﬁtted continuum models and residuals for all
seven continuum and spectral line windows in the Band 6 data.
In the maps, there are some ∼6σ residuals in the 229-GHz con-
tinuum window. However, our experiment shows that adding one
or two more Gaussian components to the uv-ﬁtting does not sig-
niﬁcantly improve the results. The residuals in the spectral line
windows appear to be less signiﬁcant than the continuum, prob-
ably because the map rms noises are much higher (by a factor of
about four) than that in the map of the continuum window.
The size and ﬂux density of our elliptical disk model for
Mira A in the continuum window are 51.2 mas × 41.0 mas (d =
7.6 × 1013 cm) and S 229.6 GHz = 102 ± 9 mJy, respectively. This
corresponds to a brightness temperature of 1630±175 K. The un-
certainly takes into account the formal errors of the ﬂux (which
is the dominant formal error), major and minor axes of the disk
model (∼0.1 mas), and the bandwidth of the continuum spec-
tral window (∼1.7 GHz). The additional Gaussian component for
Mira has a size of 26.4 mas× 22.4 mas (d = 4.0× 1013 cm) and a
ﬂux density of S 229.6 GHz = 47 ± 9 mJy, respectively. These val-
ues are consistent with those from Matthews et al. (2015) within
uncertainties, but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the ﬁtting of Vlem-
mings et al. (2015).

We have tested the uv-ﬁtting model of Vlemmings et al.
(2015) in Miriad/uvfit by setting their model parameters for
Mira A and B as the initial inputs. Without ﬁxing any parame-
ters, all the ﬁtting trials with Miriad/uvfit eventually converge
to our values as presented in Table A.1. The derived major and

Notes. The columns are (from left to right): ALMA Band 6 spectral windows (SPWs), rest frequency range of the continuum data (GHz), and the
total ﬂux (S ν, mJy) and the formal error of the ﬁtting in the parenthesis (∆S ν, mJy), major and minor axes (θmaj, θmin, mas) and the position angle
(P.A., degrees) of each component adopted in the visibility ﬁtting. Mira A was ﬁtted with an elliptical uniform disk together with an elliptical
Gaussian component, and Mira B with an elliptical Gaussian model. The formal errors for the major and minor axes are typically (cid:46)1 mas for
the models of Mira A, and (cid:46)2 mas for Mira B, except for the continuum windows (spw = 0, 7) in which the errors are (cid:46)0.2 mas for Mira A and
∼0.3 mas for Mira B. The choices of model components are the similar to those adopted by Matthews et al. (2015) and Vlemmings et al. (2015).

minor axes of the additional Gaussian component of Mira A are
always in the range of ∼20–30 mas, which are much larger than
4.7 mas as reported by Vlemmings et al. (2015). On the other
hand, even if we ﬁxed the sizes of the uniform disk and Gaus-
sian components to be the same as their values, we still could
not obtain the same results as in Vlemmings et al. (2015). Fig-
ures A.3 (top two panels) and A.4 show the visibility plots and
the maps, respectively, in the 229-GHz continuum window, of
the continuum model and residuals of both Mira A and B using
the parameters ﬁtted by Vlemmings et al. (2015). In the model
where Mira A was ﬁtted with two components, a uniform disk
(UD) and a 4.7-mas Gaussian, we obtain huge residuals that ap-
pear to be completely diﬀerent to the residual image presented
in Fig. 1 (right) of Vlemmings et al. (2015). Moreover, in the
UD-only model for Mira A (using the best-ﬁt disk model by
Vlemmings et al.), we do not obtain the single, compact and
bright hotspot near the phase centre as shown in Fig. 1 (mid-
dle) of Vlemmings et al. (2015). Instead, we ﬁnd a pair of strong
positive residual features along the SE-NW axis and strong neg-
ative features along the SW-NE axis, which may be indicative
of an inappropriate shape of the subtracted uniform disk compo-
nent. We also note the UD-only residual image of Vlemmings
et al. (2015) may show a negative spot in the north-east of the
central compact hotspot (their Fig. 1 middle). However, Vlem-
mings et al. (2015) did not show any negative contour lines or
negative colour scale in their ﬁgures.

Vlemmings et al. (2015) ﬁtted the continuum visibilities
diﬀerently from Matthews et al. (2015) and from us in two
ways. First, they ﬁtted the continuum dataset of each observ-
ing day independently, instead of combing both days together.
Second, Vlemmings et al. (2015) used a diﬀerent uv-ﬁtting tool,
UVMULTIFIT, which has been developed by the Nordic ALMA
Regional Center Node16 and can be implemented in CASA
(Martí-Vidal et al. 2014).

We have conducted additional tests to see if we may repro-
duce the ﬁtting results of Vlemmings et al. (2015) by following
any one, or both aspects of their approach. Figures A.3 (middle
two and bottom two panels) and A.5 show the visibility plots and
maps, respectively, of the ﬁtting results using Miriad/uvfit, by
splitting the continuum data into individual days of observation.
In the ﬁtting, we ﬁxed the sizes and ﬂux densities of the model

16 http://www.nordic-alma.se/support/software-tools

components of Mira A and B to be the same as Vlemmings et al.
(2015). The positions of the uniform disk (UD) component of
Mira A and the Gaussian component of Mira B were also ﬁxed
at the respective stellar positions. The only free parameter in the
UD + Gaussian model is therefore the position of the additional
Gaussian component of Mira A. Although there are some sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between the residual maps among the two
observing days, we did not obtain any satisfactory ﬁtting with
the parameters obtained by Vlemmings et al. (2015), neither did
we ﬁnd any evidence for the bright spot in the UD-only model.
In the UD + Gaussian model for the ﬁrst day of observation
(2014 Oct 29), we even found that the best-ﬁt position of the
purported hotspot to be outside the uniform disk component of
Mira A, which is far-away from the best-ﬁt position as reported
by Vlemmings et al. (2015).

Using CASA/UVMULTIFIT (version 2.1.4-r3), we also ob-
tained the similar results as reported above. Assuming the ad-
ditional Gaussian component is circular, which is the exact
same model as Vlemmings et al. (2015), the size and ﬂux den-
sity of the elliptical disk component for Mira A are found to
be 50.3 mas × 41.0 mas and S 229.6 GHz = 92.9 ± 0.1 mJy, re-
spectively; and those of the additional Gaussian component are
25.4 mas×25.4 mas and S 229.6 GHz = 56.6±0.1 mJy, respectively.
We have therefore failed to reproduce any evidence of the
compact (< 5 mas) Gaussian component in Mira A as suggested
by Vlemmings et al. (2015), even if we carried out the ﬁtting in
the exact same approach with the same set of model components
(elliptical uniform disk + circular Gaussian). Self-calibration
may be a possible cause for the discrepancy. However, from their
Sect. 2, it is unclear whether Vlemmings et al. (2015) have de-
rived the self-calibration solutions on their own or obtained the
solutions from the ALMA Science Portal (like what we did). Al-
though Vlemmings et al. (2015) discovered a compact hotspot
from their ﬁtting in Band 6, they could not ﬁnd similar structure
in the continuum data of Band 3 (94.2 GHz) in this ALMA SV
dataset with a rms sensitivity of ∼40 µJy beam−1. Assuming the
size of 4.7 mas and Gaussian brightness distribution, Vlemmings
et al. (2015) estimated in their Sect. 4.1.3 the upper limit of the
hotspot brightness temperature in Band 3 to be Tb (cid:46) 17 500 K.
However, by repeating the same calculation, we have obtained
an upper limit of Tb (cid:46) 250 K, which is a factor of 70 lower than
their estimate. Hence we cast doubt on the existence of any de-

Appendix B: A discussion on continuum

subtraction in spectral line imaging

It is a standard practice to subtract continuum emission from
spectral line data (either from the visibility domain or from the
image domain) before image deconvolution (e.g. van Langevelde
& Cotton 1990; Thompson et al. 2001, Sect. 11.9). Otherwise,
the image deconvolution algorithm (e.g., CLEAN) has to recon-
struct a continuum image for each individual, narrowband chan-
nel. Because of the non-linear nature of image deconvolution,
small diﬀerences (such as the frequency-dependent uv-coverage
or the noise) among channels may lead to very diﬀerent conver-
gence of the continuum image (e.g. Cornwell et al. 1992; Rupen
1999, Sect. 6). Further discussions on the necessity of contin-

uum subtraction in spectral line imaging can be found in Sect.
1 of Sault (1994), Sect. 16.9 of the Miriad User Guide17 (ver-
sion 14 Sep 2015), and Sect. 8.3 of the AIPS18 CookBook19
(version 31-DEC-2015).

Appendix B.1: The imaging problem

In our imaging exercises, we ﬁnd that the images produced from
the continuum-subtracted visibility data (hereafter, “continuum-
subtracted images/spectra”) and those from the full (line and
continuum) data (hereafter, “full data images/spectra”) are sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent. Figure B.1 shows the continuum-subtracted
spectra of all the observed SiO and H2O lines in ALMA Band

in the continuum window and spectral line windows are 10 times and 1 time, respectively, the standard deviation in the mean of the amplitude of
visibilities in the respective bin of uv-distance. The large error bar near 10 Mλ is due to small number of data points.

6 extracted from the centre of Mira’s radio continuum. Compar-
ing these spectra to the full data spectra shown in Fig. 8, we
expected the only diﬀerences being the trivial constant oﬀsets
of about 70–80 mJy/beam, which are the peak radio continuum
ﬂuxes of Mira in the respective frequency ranges. In reality, how-
ever, the depths of absorption near the systemic velocity chan-
nels in the continuum-subtracted spectra are signiﬁcantly shal-
lower than expected, especially for the vibrationally ground state
transitions of 28SiO and 29SiO. The eﬀects appear as perplexing
“bumps” near the systemic velocity in the continuum-subtracted
spectra. In these velocity channels, bright SiO-emitting clumps
and large-scale ((cid:38) 0(cid:48)(cid:48).1) SiO emission are present around Mira’s

radio photosphere. The discrepancy also appears in the nearby
pixels which show SiO line absorption against the continuum of
Mira’s radio photosphere.

In the line-free channels (positive and negative velocity ends
of the spectra), the continuum-subtracted spectra have much
lower noise than the full data spectra. This is consistent with the
fact that CLEAN would introduce additional noise to the image
areas where real sources (in our case, the radio continuum) exist
(see, for example, Sect. 8.3 of the AIPS CookBook).

Appendix B.2: Continuum subtraction in the visibility and the

image domains

We have ﬁrst compared the imaging results of continuum sub-
traction in the visibility domain and in the (DIRTY) image
domain, using the CASA tasks uvcontsub (then clean) and
imcontsub (then deconvolve, which deconvolves the images
purely in the image domain), respectively. Both approaches pro-
duce the same “bumps” in the absorption spectra. Hence, we
conclude that the discrepancy between the continuum-subtracted
and the full data images arises from the image deconvolution
(CLEAN) process, but not continuum subtraction.

The following are the two most probable causes of the dis-

crepancy:

1. the full data imaging has failed to recover all SiO line emis-
sion, possibly extended, around Mira’s radio photosphere
(i.e., missing emission) or, conversely,

2. the continuum-subtracted imaging has failed to recover the
correct amount of SiO line absorption against Mira’s radio
continuum (i.e., missing absorption).

Appendix B.3: Natural weighting versus robust weighting
The ﬁrst possibility depends on the scales of emission structures
and the antenna conﬁguration. In the full data images, all real as-
trophysical signals would have non-negative ﬂuxes because the
continuum emission is included in the data. The strongest line
absorption can at most attenuate all the radio ﬂux (i.e., down
to zero, but not negative) from the continuum behind the col-
umn of gas along the line-of-sight. In the continuum-subtracted
images, on the other hand, strong negative signals would ap-

pear in the pixels of Mira’s radio photosphere—representing the
line absorption against the continuum—and, strong positive sig-
nals would appear around the continuum disk—representing the
line-emitting gas outside the radio photosphere. Because of the
negative “hole” amidst the positive pixels, any real emission or
absorption structures in the continuum-subtracted images would
appear to be less extended than those in the full data images.
Since the visibility plane sampling (uv-sampling) of ALMA in
the long baseline conﬁguration is rather sparse, full data imag-
ing may not be able to recover all possible extended SiO emis-
sion from the inner wind of Mira.

Our imaging (Sect. 2) has adopted robust weighting with the
parameter RBriggs = 0.5. If the “missing emission” scenario is
true, then the discrepancy between the continuum-subtracted and
the full data spectra should be alleviated under natural weight-
ing, which gives relatively higher weightings to data of short
baselines and hence is more sensitive to extended structures.
Natural weighting can therefore recover more missing ﬂux (if
it exists at all) from the extended SiO emission around the ra-
dio photosphere of Mira. Since natural weighting gives slightly
larger synthesised beam than robust weighting, we only com-
pare the maps of CLEAN component (hereafter, CC) models un-
der the two diﬀerent weighting schemes to eliminate the eﬀect
of the beam sizes. We integrate the total ﬂux of the CC models
within circles of various spatial scales, centred at Mira’s radio
continuum, and obtain the CC spectra of all the images. In con-
trary to what is expected from the “missing emission” scenario,
we ﬁnd that the full data CC spectra (not presented) are essen-
tially identical under both weighting schemes. The fact that a
higher weighting in short baselines does not recover more ﬂuxes
suggests that the ALMA antenna conﬁgurations in the SV ob-

A&A proofs: manuscript no. aa-2015-27867

servation were not missing any signiﬁcant amount of extended
SiO emission from Mira’s inner wind. The absorption proﬁles
of the continuum-subtracted CC spectra, on the other hand, show
“bumps” that are even more prominent under natural weighting
than under robust weighting.

In addition to the above test, we also do not expect any miss-
ing ﬂux from extended emission structure for two reasons. First,
the shortest baseline of this ALMA SV observation is 15 m, cor-
responding to a maximum recoverable scale20 of over 11(cid:48)(cid:48) for
the observed SiO transitions, which is at least one order of mag-
nitude larger than the expected SiO depletion radius. Gas den-
sity and kinetic temperature also drop rapidly beyond the in-
ner wind of Mira. So we expect the excitation of SiO molecules
(both isotopologues) beyond the radius of the detected emission
to be both varying and very weak. It is unlikely that a smooth
and large-scale SiO emission exists, and that the missing ﬂux
of which could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the absorption spectra. Sec-
ond, negative “bowls” around smaller-scale emission structures,
which are characteristic features if smooth extended emission
is missing (e.g. Bajaja & van Albada 1979; Braun & Walterbos
1985), are not seen in any of our images.

Appendix B.4: Number of CLEAN iterations

We therefore consider the second possibility in which the
CLEAN process of the continuum-subtracted images may have
underestimated the amount of foreground SiO line absorption
against the background radio continuum. In order to trace the
process of CLEAN iterations and the ﬁrst batch of CC models se-
lected by the algorithm, we make two additional sets of images,
each using a small ﬁxed number of CLEAN iterations instead of
an rms noise-dependent threshold as the stopping criteria. Figure
B.2 shows the spectra extracted from the images of SiO  = 0
J = 5 − 4 CLEANed with 200 and 1000 iterations, as well as
the spectra from the DIRTY images (no CLEAN iteration) and
the fully CLEANed (down to the threshold value as speciﬁed
in Sect. 2) images. In Fig. B.2, the “bump” feature is seen in
all spectra. Its amplitude reaches the maximum in the spectrum
extracted from the DIRTY images, and gradually reduces as the
number of iterations increases. In general, the DIRTY images are
the most severely “corrupted” by the sidelobes of ALMA’s point-
spread function (i.e., the DIRTY beam). As CLEAN proceeds to
more iterations, the eﬀect of the sidelobes should diminish and
eventually vanish below the noise when a low-enough threshold
is reached. The apparent resemblance of the “bump” in the fully
CLEANed spectra to that in the DIRTY spectra and the decreas-
ing trend of the “bump” amplitude in the continuum-subtracted
spectra with an increasing number of CLEAN iterations seem to
suggest that the “bump”, or excess emission in individual chan-
nels, may indeed be the artefacts introduced by the sidelobes of
the array’s point-spread function that have not been completely
removed by the CLEAN algorithm.

A closer inspection of the 200- and 1000-iteration CC model
maps (not presented) shows that the ﬁrst 1000 CC models se-
lected by the CLEAN algorithm essentially all come from the
strong SiO emission in the immediate proximity of Mira’s radio
photosphere. Only a handful of (negative) CC models were found
within the radio continuum disk of Mira. We therefore speculate
that, the initial deconvolution of the strong, extended (scales of
the order of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).1) SiO emission outside the radio continuum may
have impaired the subsequent deconvolution of the line absorp-
tion within the continuum disk.

Appendix B.5: Long-baseline image deconvolution

To examine the performance of image deconvolution when we
exclude the contribution from the extended (∼0(cid:48)(cid:48).1) SiO emis-
sion outside Mira’s radio photosphere, another set of continuum-
subtracted images are produced for all the observed SiO and
H2O lines in Band 6 using only baselines longer than 500 m. The
minimum baseline of 500 m corresponds to maximum recover-
able scales of about 342–347 mas for the SiO lines, and about
319 mas for the H2O line. In these long-baseline images, the de-
tected ﬂux of the SiO emission around the radio photosphere is
signiﬁcantly reduced or even eliminated. Figure B.3 shows the
spectra extracted from the centre of the radio continuum in the
long-baseline, continuum-subtracted images. The long-baseline
spectra do not show any “bumps” in the original continuum-
subtracted spectra (Fig. B.1), and resemble the similar inverse P
Cygni absorption proﬁles in the full data spectra (Fig. 8). How-
ever, the maximum depths of absorption in the long-baseline
spectra of 28SiO and 29SiO  = 0 transitions appear to be even
larger, by about 5 mJy, than the ﬂux level of the radio contin-
uum being absorbed (cf. Fig. 8). We do not have a deﬁnitive
answer for this “over-absorption” problem. In the long-baseline
images, negative “bowls” are seen at radial distances larger than
the SiO emission region. These are the expected characteristic
features due to the lack of short baselines (< 500 m). The region
of the continuum disk amidst the SiO emission is exterior to the
“hollow” emission region, and therefore may indeed contain the
artefactual negative signals due to the lack of short baselines in
addition to the real absorption from the foreground SiO gas.

Appendix B.6: CASA simulation of the ALMA SV observation

Finally, we also simulate the ALMA SV observation of Mira to
test if our preferred model (Sect. 4.4.1), which apparently pro-
duces satisfactory ﬁts to the observed full data spectra, can also
reproduce the observed “bumps” in the continuum-subtracted
spectra. Positive results would imply that our preferred model
can consistently reproduce both the full data and the continuum-
subtracted spectra, regardless of the (still uncertain) causes of the
discrepancy in the spectra; negative results, on the other hand,
would suggest that our model is still far from approximately
describing the structures and physical conditions of Mira’s ex-
tended atmosphere and inner wind.
In the CASA simulation task simobserve, we use the sky
output model for the 28SiO  = 0 J = 5−4 transition from ratran
modelling (Sect. 4) as the input skymodel. For simplicity, we
regard the two days of Mira’s SV observation as one continuous
observing block in the simulation, and adopt approximate val-
ues for the observation parameters. The hour angle at the mid-
point of the simulated observation (hourangle) and the total
on-source time (totaltime) are set to be −0.8 h and 4000 s, re-
spectively. We also use the actual ALMA antenna conﬁguration
in Mira’s SV observation as the input antennalist. Table B.1
lists all 39 ALMA antenna pads (stations) deployed in the SV
observation. Note, however, that only 35 or 36 antennae out of
39 were used in each day of observation (ALMA Partnership
et al. 2015). Moreover, we did not consider data ﬂagging dur-
ing the calibration process. These would slightly aﬀect the ar-
ray’s point-spread function and the map rms noise, but we do
not expect a signiﬁcant deviation from the reality. The longest
and shortest baselines also resemble those of the real visibility
data. simobserve produces a simulated visibility data, contain-
ing both the continuum and line data (as in our radiative transfer
model). We then perform continuum subtraction (with the task

Notes. (a) 23 antennae in the nominal 2014 ALMA Long Baseline Cam-
paign (LBC) conﬁguration with a minimum baseline of about 400 m (cf.

Figure B.4 shows the resultant spectra of the simulation,
overlaid with the real spectra as already presented in Figs. 8
(full data) and B.1 (continuum-subtracted). Our simulation suc-
cessfully reproduces the same “bump”, with the same amplitude
(within the noise) and in the same velocity range, in the absorp-
tion proﬁle of the continuum-subtracted spectrum. Because this
“bump” is not present in (1) the full data spectrum, (2) the spec-
trum extracted from modelled images convolved with a circu-
lar beam (i.e., the modelled spectra in the top-left panel of Fig.
10), or (3) our input sky brightness model, we conclude that
the “bump” in the continuum-subtracted spectrum is indeed a
spurious feature introduced during the imaging (CLEAN) pro-
cess. We also suggest that the “bump” is caused by the “missing
absorption” scenario as described in Appendix B.2. Based on
the analyses in the previous sections (Appendices B.3–B.5), we
speculate that the image deconvolution of the strong SiO emis-
sion surrounding the continuum disk, which corresponds to the
ﬁrst batch of the CLEAN component models, has probably im-
paired the deconvolution of the line absorption region in the im-
ages. However, it is still unclear how this has happened despite
the fact that CLEAN should be able to handle positive and neg-
ative signals equally well. In view of the possible limitations of
the CLEAN algorithm, it may be worthwhile to perform imaging
tests for this SV data with novel aperture synthesis techniques
in radio astronomy (e.g. Sutter et al. 2014; Carrillo et al. 2014;
Lochner et al. 2015; Junklewitz et al. 2016).

There are a few other important features in the simulated
images and spectra. The noise in the line-free channels of the
simulated full data spectrum is comparable to the observed one,
and both are signiﬁcantly higher than the observed/simulated
continuum-subtracted spectra. This further supports our earlier
claim in Appendix B.1 that CLEANing the radio continuum in
individual channels could introduce additional noise to the im-
age products.
We also notice that the simulated spectra do not ﬁt well to
the observed ones near the velocity of +10 km s−1. We attribute
this to the imperfection of our physical model rather than issues
in the data processing (see Sect. 4.4.1).
Our input sky brightness model, which only models the re-
gion around Mira up to 0(cid:48)(cid:48).3 and ignores the remote, arc-like
emission feature, is spherically symmetric. The modelled inten-
sity varies smoothly with radius. So one would expect that the
simulated images to behave in a similar manner. The simulated
images, however, do contain a lot of clumpy structures that are
very similar to what we see in Figs. 2, 3, and 7. Figure B.5 shows

Article number, page 40 of 55

the simulated full data image of the SiO  = 0 line near the sys-
temic velocity, i.e. the channel in which the scale of the SiO
emission is the largest. Similar to the same map from the actual
observation (Fig. 7), the simulated map also shows structures of
enhanced brightness all over the region being modelled. Figure
B.6 shows the simulated channel maps of the images, with the
continuum subtracted after imaging. These maps also resemble
the real data counterpart as shown in Fig. 2: the core SiO line-
emitting region appears to be globally spherically symmetric,
but it also contains some irregular structures of the similar spa-
tial scales. Qualitatively speaking, the simulated maps are more
symmetric and smoother than the real observed maps. The pres-
ence of clumpy structures in the simulated images may be due
to the sparse uv-sampling of the ALMA long baseline conﬁgura-
tion, which makes image deconvolution diﬃcult. In addition, the
signal-to-noise ratio may not be suﬃcient to clearly detect the
SiO emission in Mira’s extended atmosphere. Hence, the simu-
lated ALMA observation suggests that the clumpy structures in
the extended atmosphere and inner wind of Mira may not be all
real.

Appendix C: Full data channel maps (without

continuum subtraction)

Figures C.1–C.5 show the channel maps without continuum sub-
traction. As explained in Sects. 2 and 3.2, we extract from these
maps the spectra for our radiative transfer modelling and discus-
sion in Sects. 3.3, 4, and 5.

µSi−H2

(cid:114) µSi−He

Collisional rate coeﬃcients between SiO and para-H2 (J = 0)
are often approximated by scaling the rate coeﬃcients of the
SiO–He system by the square root of the ratio of the reduced
masses of the two collisional partners, i.e.,
= 1.38
(e.g. Schöier et al. 2005). Based on the Gordon-Kim electron
gas model (Gordon & Kim 1972), Bieniek & Green (1981) have
derived the potential energy surface (PES) of the SiO–He sys-
tem, from which the potential energy of the system in terms of
the orientation of the two molecules can be derived (e.g. Lewars
2011, Chap. 2). Bieniek & Green (1983a,b) then computed the
collisional cross sections and hence the corresponding rate co-
eﬃcients for  ≤ 2, J ≤ 39 and ∆ = 0, 1 for the H2 gas tem-
perature range between 1000 K and 3000 K. Turner et al. (1992)
have derived the rate coeﬃcients, for  = 0 and J ≤ 20 only,
in a lower temperature range of 20–300 K by extrapolating the
PES of Bieniek & Green (1981) to shorter collision distances
between SiO and He. With the ab initio method as described in
their Section 2, Dayou & Balança (2006) have derived a new
PES for the SiO–He system which diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that
derived by Bieniek & Green (1981). The resultant rate coeﬃ-
cients from Dayou & Balança (2006) are diﬀerent from those
from Turner et al. (1992) by up to an order of magnitude, with the
odd/even-∆J propensity rule reversed. The diﬀerences are qual-
itatively similar to the ﬁnding by Thomas et al. (1980) that the
rate coeﬃcients derived by an electron gas model could be un-
derestimated or overestimated by about 2 to 3 times in the odd-
or even-∆J transitions, respectively, relative to ab initio calcu-
lation. Hence, in our SiO dataﬁle, we adopt the rate coeﬃcients

At the gas temperature T, the collisional rate coeﬃcients, kJu Jl,

The IOS approximation requires that the diﬀerence in the ro-
tational energy levels is insigniﬁcant to the kinetic energy of
the system, which may not be the case for high ∆J transi-
tions. An adiabaticity factor for purely rotational transitions (i.e.,
∆ = 0), AJu
j (T), is therefore required to account for this eﬀect
(Ramaswamy et al. 1979; DePristo et al. 1979). The adiabaticity
factor at the gas temperature T is given by

where B0 = 0.724 is the rotation constant of SiO ( = 0) in

µSiO−H2

unit. To obtain the full set of rate coeﬃcients up to Ju = 69, we
need to know the coeﬃcients k j0 for j from 1 up to 137. The
SiO–H2 rate coeﬃcients (scaled from SiO–He values) computed
by Dayou & Balança (2006) are up to j = 26 only. We extrap-
olate the coeﬃcients k j0 to higher rotational levels by ﬁtting the

width of 1 km s−1. The velocity is slightly diﬀerent from the systemic velocity of 46.7 km s−1 because of the diﬀerent velocity grid in our model.
The orange contours represent the real data of Mira’s radio continuum at 229 GHz.

The ﬁtting function in Eq. (D.5) does not adopt a second-
order term (c j2) as in Schöier et al. (2005) in order to get con-
sistent ﬁtting for all values of temperatures. The values of k j0
become vanishingly small for j (cid:29) Ju, and hence their contribu-
tions to the summation of the coeﬃcient kJu Jl are insigniﬁcant.
Odd and even j are ﬁtted together, so the propensity rule is ig-
nored for the extrapolated j-levels.

However, the rate coeﬃcients computed with Eq. (D.1) and
the extrapolated k j0 values are consistently smaller than those
theoretically derived by Dayou & Balança (2006). In view of
the discrepancy between the Dayou & Balança coeﬃcients and
the extrapolated coeﬃcients, we make direct extrapolation of the
rate coeﬃcients kJu Jl instead of summing up the extrapolated k j0
in Eq. (D.1). For each Jl ≤ 23, we extrapolated kJu Jl to higher Ju
with

ln kJu Jl

= a + bJu.

For a particular Jl, the variation of the collisional rate coef-
ﬁcients with Ju will then be smoother than in the LAMDA SiO
dataﬁle.

Appendix D.2.1: Extrapolation to high J and high T
The extrapolation of BG1983 coeﬃcients works on the parame-
ters presented in Table 1 of Bieniek & Green (1983a,b). In their
Table 1, the parameters (2Ji + 1)ki,Ji
 f ,0 from Ji = 0 to
39 are presented, where ki,Ji
 f ,0(T0) is the rate coeﬃcient from the
initial level (i, Ji) to the ground rotational level of the ﬁnal vi-
brational state ( f , 0) at T0 = 2000 K, and qi,Ji
 f ,0 is the power-law
index of the same transition, which describes the temperature de-
pendence of the rate coeﬃcients in the range 1000–3000 K such
that

After the extrapolation, we then compute the full set of rate

similar to Eq. (D.1), with the only diﬀerences being that Ju and Jl
in Eq. (D.1) are replaced by Ji (initial level) and J f (ﬁnal level),
respectively. We only apply the adiabaticity factor (Eq. D.4) to
the terms within the summation for the pure rotational transition
within the same vibrational state, i.e., i =  f = 1 or 2. For transi-
tions involving a change in the vibrational state, ∆ = i−  f (cid:44) 0,
DePristo et al. (1979) have derived a factorisation for the sum-
mation terms to correct for the inaccuracy of IOS approxima-
tion when the kinetic energy is no longer much greater than the
energy of the transition. However, because the rate coeﬃcients
without the correction are not accurate anyway (see our discus-
sion in Appendix D.1) and the corrected coeﬃcients would not
change by many orders of magnitude, we do not think it worth-
while to carry out the factorisation which is quite computation-
ally complicated. So no adiabaticity correction has been applied

to the rate coeﬃcients of transitions with ∆ (cid:44) 0, i.e., AJi
 f ,0, are supposed to be
valid only for T = 1000–3000 K, we still adopt the same in-
dices for rate coeﬃcients at T < 1000 K and T > 3000 K be-
cause alternative estimate is not available. New calculations of
the collisional rate coeﬃcients for a broad range of kinetic tem-
perature and for the vibrationally excited states with the updated
PES model will be very useful.

Although the power law indices, qi,Ji

The only available collisional rate coeﬃcients of vibrationally
excited SiO in the literature are those derived by Bieniek &
Green (1983a,b), based on the old PES model for the SiO–He
system and in the temperature range of 1000–3000 K. Thus,
for all transitions involving the vibrationally excited states of
SiO, we extrapolate from the coeﬃcients of Bieniek & Green
(1983a,b) (hereafter BG1983 coeﬃcients).

Appendix D.3: Collisions with rotationally excited H2
AGB stars typically have a surface temperature of ∼3000 K. In
the winds and circumstellar envelopes of these stars, the gas tem-
perature ranges from a few hundred to (cid:46)3000 K. Molecular hy-
drogen in these environments may be signiﬁcantly populated in
the upper rotational levels (e.g. Flower 1989; Doel 1990; Field

radius rapidly; the ﬂux of the far side molecular emission, on
the other hand, decreases more gradually. Hence, the inverse P
Cygni proﬁle of the molecular transition emerges from the de-
creasing continuum level. The blueshifted emission feature in
the resultant spectra after beam convolution represents the com-
bined eﬀect of the inner continuum-dominated emission and the
outer line-dominated emission. The excess blueshifted emission
in Model 1 therefore suggests two possibilities: (1) the gas tem-
perature at the innermost radii in this model is signiﬁcantly over-
estimated, and/or (2) this model does not reproduce suﬃcient
absorption in the blueshifted velocities.

1998). For examples, the wavelengths of the lowest para-H2 tran-
sition, S (0) (Eup/k = 510 K), and the lowest ortho-H2 transi-
tion, S (1) (Eup/k = 1015 K), are 28.2 µm and 17.0 µm, respec-
tively (Dabrowski 1984). The approximation of the collisional
rate coeﬃcients by the scaled (by ∼1.4) coeﬃcients with atomic
helium as the collision partner is only valid for the collisions
with para-H2 (J = 0), but not for other rotational states of H2
(Field 1998). Lique & Kłos (2008) and Kłos & Lique (2008)
have found that the rate coeﬃcients for the collisions between
the diatomic molecule SiS with para-H2 (J = 0) are signiﬁcantly
lower than those for the collisions with ortho-H2 (J = 1) or para-
H2 (J = 2) by up to an order of magnitude. Similarly, Daniel
et al. (2011, and references therein) have also found that the col-
lisions between H2O and rotationally excited H2 in the J = 1
and 2 states are the dominant processes in the collisional (de-
)excitation of H2O molecule.

For SiO molecule, because the currently available collisional
rate coeﬃcients do not consider rotationally excited H2 (J = 1
or 2) as the collision partners, the collisional (de-)excitations of
SiO in the radiative transfer modelling could well be inaccurate
and it is not possible to estimate the errors. In our modelling, it
appears that most of the absorption/emission is contributed by
the regions which are close to local thermodynamic equilibrium,
otherwise there would not be enough absorption along the line-
of-sight towards the continuum or there would be strong maser
emission in the SiO  = 0 and 2 transitions, which show very
weak or no maser in the data. So the gas temperature and ex-
pansion/infall velocity proﬁles are probably not aﬀected by the
incomplete collisional rate coeﬃcients, but the magnitudes of the
H2 gas density and SiO abundance may not be accurate.

Appendix E: Infall-only models
We present here two models, Models 1 and 2, that fail to repro-
duce the observed SiO and H2O spectra around Mira in ALMA
Band 6. Models 1 and 2 exhibit global infall motion only, while
our preferred model (Model 3; Sect. 4.4.1) contains a globally
expanding layer between the radio photosphere and the globally
infalling region.

We ﬁrst test the infall velocity proﬁles with monotonically
increasing infall velocity (Model 1). Figure E.1 shows the pro-
ﬁles of the gas density (top-left), infall velocity (top-right), SiO
and H2O abundances (middle) and the kinetic temperature (bot-
tom). The bottom row of Fig. E.1 also shows the excitation tem-
peratures of the SiO and H2O transitions (in colour).
Figures E.2, E.3, and E.4 show our modelled and observed
spectra for SiO  = 0 J = 5 − 4, SiO  = 2 J = 5 − 4, and H2O
= 55,0−64,3, respectively. The top-left panel of these
v2 = 1 JKa,Kc
ﬁgures show the spectra extracted from the line-of-sight towards
the continuum centre. Although Model 1 may ﬁt well to the
redshifted wings (about +10 to +15 km s−1) of the SiO spectra,
there is signiﬁcant excess emission from the blueshifted veloc-
ities between about −10 and −4 km s−1. The excess blueshifted
emission is also seen in the spectra extracted from 32 mas. Addi-
tionally, in this spectra extracted from 32 mas, there is an absorp-
tion feature against the continuum near the redshifted velocity of
about +10 km s−1, which is not present in the observed spectra.
the observed weak
blueshifted emission feature around the velocities from −10 to
−3 km s−1 originates from the emission from the far side of
Mira’s extended atmosphere. As the line-of-sight moves away
from the continuum disk, the emission ﬂux of the radio contin-
uum, which is represented by a circular uniform disk in our in-
put model and appears as a ﬂat line in the spectra, falls oﬀ with

For the ﬁrst postulation, we have constructed Model 2, which
is identical to Model 1 with the only exception being that the
gas temperature near the radio photosphere is signiﬁcantly re-
duced from 2100 K in the original model to about 1400 K. Figure
E.5 shows the input gas temperature and the modelled excitation
temperature proﬁles for the SiO and H2O transitions. Figures
E.6, E.7 and E.8 show the modelled spectra with reduced input
gas temperature.

Our modelling results in Figs. E.6, E.7 and E.8 show that
even if we reduce the kinetic temperature to (cid:46) 1400 K in the en-
tire inner wind of Mira, there is still an excess in the blueshifted
emission. In fact, we have found that the gas temperature near
the radio photosphere has to be much lower than 1000 K in order
to get rid of this excess emission. In addition, when the kinetic
temperature in the proximity of the continuum is reduced, excess
absorption relative to the observed spectra would appear in both
the SiO and H2O spectra. Although the excess absorption may
be compensated by adopting diﬀerent gas density and molecu-
lar abundance proﬁles, we do no consider the low-temperature
atmosphere to be a likely solution.

We therefore speculate that, in the hot and dense part of
the extended atmosphere of Mira (presumably at the inner-
most radius), there should be a relatively low-infall velocity, or
even expanding, component contributing to the absorption in the
blueshifted part of the spectra. In other words, the infall veloc-
ity the modelled region should not increase monotonically to-
wards the star, but has to decelerate at some radii. In our pre-
ferred model (Model 3), we modify the velocity proﬁle such that
the motion of the bulk material switches from infall to expansion
rapidly at 3.75 × 1013 cm, which is just above our adopted radio
photosphere (Rcontinuum = 3.60 × 1013cm). This expansion zone
lies beneath the infall region and hence a large scale shock of
shock velocity ∆V (cid:46) 12 km s−1 (constrained by the width of the
line proﬁle) could be created near this radius.

Fig. E.1. Inputs for Model 1. Shown in the panels are the H2 gas density (top-left) , infall velocity (negative represents expansion) (top-right),
28SiO abundance (middle-left), H2O abundance (middle-right), and the kinetic temperature (in black) and excitation temperatures (in colours)
of the three 28SiO transitions (bottom-left) and the H2O transition (bottom-right). In the bottom-right panel, solid red line indicates positive
excitation temperature (i.e., non-maser emission) of the H2O transition, and the dashed red line indicates the absolute values of the negative
excitation temperature (i.e., population inversion) between 1.7×1014 and 2.2×1014 cm. Small negative values for the excitation temperature would
give strong maser emission. Vertical dotted lines mark the radii at which the spectra were extracted; coloured horizontal dotted lines in the bottom
panels indicates the upper-state energy (Eup/k) of the respective transitions. The innermost layer within Rcontinuum represents the grid cells for the
pseudo-continuum, in which the input values for H2 gas density and molecular abundances are above the range of the plots.
