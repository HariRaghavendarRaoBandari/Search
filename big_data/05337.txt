Abstract

In this work we study a brane world model with variable tension which gives rise to four di-

mensional cosmologies. The brane worlds obtained corresponds to E¨otv¨os branes whose (internal)

geometry can be casted as either a four dimensional (A)dS4 or a standard radiation period cos-

mology. The matter dominated period is discussed as well.

INTRODUCTION

A largely open question in physics has been the huge diﬀerence between the values of the

Higgs mass, mH ≈ 1T eV , and the Planck mass mP ≈ 1019GeV , also called the hierarchy

problem. In 1999 Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum [3] proposed a model of two statics

3-branes with constant tensions of equal magnitude but opposite signs imbedded in an AdS5

space. Our observed universe corresponds in this model to the positive tension brane. The

geometry considered in that model can be described by the metric

ds2

5 = e−2kr|φ|ηµνdxµdxν + r2dφ,

(1)

where e−2kr|φ| is called the warp factor. The coordinate system xM = (xµ, φ), with xµ =

(t, x, y, z), satisﬁes −∞ < xµ < ∞ and φ ∈ [−π, π[. Our universe is located at φ = 0 and the

secondary brane, which is called the strong brane, at φ = π = −π. The hierarchy problem is

solved in this model due to the mass in the two branes is related by mφ=0 = e−krπmφ=π. This

allows the Planck mass at strong brane to be of same order of Higgs mass at our universe

provided ekrπ ≈ 1015.

In RS model both branes have constant tension and the geometry is static. This last,

however, does not describe an evolving universe. To do that the brane section should be

promoted at least to (a ﬂat-FRW)

ηµνdxµdxν → −dt2 + a(t)2dx · dx.

(2)

From a geometrical point of view Eq.(2) is not a minor change. A solution is to consider

a brane world scenario with variable tension branes. This implies that the branes considered

cannot be fundamental branes of the standard fashion. However, this not all, and another

aspect to be addressed is establishing the dependency on the temperature of the evolution

of the brane-universe or viceversa. In Ref.

[7] was proposed that the tension of our brane

universe should depend on the temperature of the universe according to E¨otv¨os law:

T = K(xc − x),

(3)

where K is a constant, x represents the temperature and xc is a initial temperature of our

universe. Motivated by Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the energy density of the CMB is

proportional to x4, it can be proposed that x ∝ a−1 and therefore (3) can be rewritten as:

T = Kxc(cid:16)1 −

amin

a(t)(cid:17),

2

(4)

where amin is the initial value of scale factor on our universe. This model is called E¨otv¨os

branes, see ref. [7], and predicts that as our universe expands, and the temperature decreases,

the tension of our brane universe increases, becoming more and more rigid. This model is

compatible with the current observations. It must be stressed that, at least in principle, this

model does not constraint the strong brane dependency on time or temperature.

In [10] Abdalla, da Silva and da Rocha proposed a modiﬁcation of the E¨otv¨os branes

where the brane tension becomes the linear function of t, the FRWL time,

T = ±λt ± β,

(5)

where λ and β are positive constants. The ﬁnal result of the model is a universe that as

it expands and cools the brane tension increases. This reproduces most of the features of

the E¨otv¨os branes. Unfortunately this model does not provide a direct solution for the scale

factor a(t) in the FRWL metric.

In work we aim to test a toy model of variable tension branes that reproduce a E¨otv¨os

brane for the universe and simultaneously constraints the form a(t) by the ﬁve dimensional

Einstein equations. To consider non constant tension branes requires to propose a model

for the brane. Following [10], and in order to simplify the computations, the only change,

with respect to a fundamental brane, is to replace the constant tension by

T +

t
k

dT
dt

where k is a dimensionless parameter. The idea behind this is to introduce a conformal

expansion along the FRW time. This choice allows to obtain diﬀerent solution for T , using

the Brane World Sum Rules of the same fashion as Eq.(4) but without the need to impose

a priori an E¨otv¨os tension.

The number of solutions is large, but since this work is not aimed to represent the

complete scenario of a variable tension brane world model, the analysis will be restricted to

only three cases of physical interest. It is worth noticing that this model is compatible with

those discussed in [19] and references there in.

In the next section, we derive the Brane World Sum Rules method. Next we will ﬁnd the

tensions of both branes and the scale factor.

II. BRANE WORLD SUM RULES METHOD

Brane World Sum Rules is a set of consistency conditions derived from the Einstein

equations for brane world scenarios with spatially periodic internal space. See [8]. This

method allows to ﬁnd relations between the cosmological constant Λ5D, the Ricci scalar

R(4D) and the tensions of both branes. Let’s consider the line element:

ds2 = W 2(φ)gµν(xα)dxµdxν + r2dφ2,

(6)

where xα = (t, x, y, z) and x5 = φ takes the values −π < φ < π. r is radius of compactiﬁca-

tion. This yields

In the same fashion, multiplying equation (9) by (1 − n)W n and (10) by (n − 4)W n and

adding both equations, yields

which is replaced by (the conformal expansion on the FRW time) T + t

Here ˜TM N stands for the EM tensor of the rest of the matter ﬁelds, either constrained or not

to the branes. In this toy model we have not considered equations of motion to be satisﬁed

by the matter ﬁelds. This produces that in general some of the integration constants cannot

be determined.

In next section it will be studied the cases where T1, the tension of the brane that

represents our universe, can be casted as

therefore when the brane corresponds to a E¨otv¨os branes.

T1 = Kxc(cid:16)1 −

amin

a(t)(cid:17),

(27)

It must be stressed that in this model T2 is left partially undetermined by the equations

of motions. The reason for this, as mentioned above, is that equations of motion of the ﬁve

dimensional matter ﬁelds, and its boundary conditions, are not considered in this toy model.

IV. DE-SITTER DS4 SCENARIO

To begin with the discussion we will start with case ˜T M N = 0. In this case we consider

a ﬂat transverse section in the brane, i.e., a metric of the form

ds2 = e−2A(φ)(−dt2 + a(t)2dx · dx) + r2dφ2.

(28)

6

The generalization to constant curvature transverse section is straightforward and does not

provide new physical relevant information.

Remarkably this case contains as solution

a(t) = eH(t−t0)

(29)

where H is a constant and t0 is the current age of our universe. H corresponds to the

standard Hubble constant (parameter). The tension of the de-Sitter brane is given by

T1 = U −

C3

eH(t−t0) ,

(30)

which satisﬁes the E¨otv¨os law. By setting U = Kxc (since U is constant in dS4 case) and

C3 = aminU = aminKxc, the T1 can be written as

It must be noticed, since U > 0, T1 increases with t (or with a(t)) yielding a brane which

T1 = Kxc(cid:16)1 −

amin

eH(t−t0)(cid:17).

(31)

becomes more rigid as time evolves. On the other hand, from equation (26), the strong

brane tension,

T2 =

aminKxc
eH(t−t0) ,

(32)

is positive. It is direct to observe that T2 decreases with the time and therefore it become

less rigid as time evolves.

It must be noticed that, even though this model is inspired by a generalization of a RS

space, to immerse the branes into a negative cosmological space (Λ5D < 0) is not strictly

necessary. This is due to the fact that dS4 can be immersed into a AdS5 as well as into a dS5

or even into a ﬁve dimensional Minkowski space provided certain conditions are satisﬁed.

Constraints

In the next table are shown the diﬀerent warp factors, the corresponding U and the
constraints for U > 0, such as T1 increases with a(t), at the scenarios Λ5D → 0 and Λ5D = ± 6

respectively.

where K1 is a constant, and the ∗ at the table means that for diﬀerent values of K1 , the

V. RADIATION DOMINATION

The next simplest solution can be obtained by imposing the vanishing of the four di-

mensional Ricci scalar, R(4D) = 0. See Eq.(19). For this let us consider a general energy

momentum tensor, only constrained by the symmetries of the space,

˜T C

N = diag(cid:16) − ρ(t, φ), p(t, φ), p(t, φ), p(t, φ), p5(t, φ)(cid:17).

(33)

Firstly, to have a solution with the line element (28) is necessary to be restricted to the

case Λ5D < 0. It is direct to prove, as for standard cosmology, that the direct solution for
R(4D) = 0 is a(t) = (t/t0)1/2 where t0 is the current cosmological time. However, and unlike

the standard cosmological case, in this case this restricts a set of functions of φ and t. The

Einstein equations determine that p5(t, φ) = 0 and

A(φ) =

r
l

|φ|,

(34)

where the negative ﬁve dimensional cosmological constant has been ﬁxed as Λ5D = − 6
l2 .

Finally, the Einstein equations also determine that

ρ(t, φ) =

2r

l |φ|

e

t2

3
4

and p(t, φ) =

2r

l |φ|

e

t2

4

.

As the trace of ˜T M N vanishes as well as its partial trace (four dimensions), i.e., ( ˜T M

M =
˜T µ
µ = 0) this energy momentum tensor seems to correspond to a ﬂuid that is a generalization

of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. Notice that the energy momentum tensor, unlike its trace, does

not vanish outside of the branes but it extends into space between both branes. One can

argued, by observing the components, that this energy momentum tensor can be generated

by the combination of a ﬁve dimensional pressureless ﬂuid and a ﬂuid of string-like objets

with endpoints at both branes and a two form ﬁeld of the form B(xµ, φ) = A(xµ, φ)µdxµ ∧dφ

which couples the string-like ﬂuid. The pullback of B into the branes, A, can be interpreted

as the EM gauge potential.

8

Tension of both branes

As V = 0 and ˜T µ

µ − 4 ˜T 5

5 vanishes, then Eq.(26) implies

T1 + T2 = −

C
tk .

(35)

where C and k are arbitrary. Now, in order to have a consistent set of equations and ﬁx T1

into the form of an E¨otv¨os brane, is necessary that k = 1/2. This implies that the tensions

are respectively,

T1 =H1 −

C4
t1/2

T2 = − H1 +

C5
t1/2 ,

(36)

(37)

where C = C4 − C5 and H1 are arbitrary constants. To cast T1 into the form of an E¨otv¨os
brane form in Eq.(4) it is necessary to ﬁx the constant as H1 = Kxc and C4 = amint1/2

0 H1.

As mentioned above T2 is left partially undetermined. The simplest solution is T2 = −Kxc

(C5 = 0) leaving a negative, but constat, tension brane.

VI. MATTER DOMINATED ERA

In the model proposed, for line element (28), is also possible to obtain a solution with

A(φ) similar to equation (34) and a(t) = (t/t0)2/3 which corresponds, from the point of view

of the universe brane, to a matter dominated era in a standard cosmological model. For this

to happen p(t, φ) = 0 must be satisﬁed as well. In addition

ρ(t, φ) =

4
3

e2A(φ)

t2

.

Finally, the rest of the Einstein equations implies that

p5(t, φ) = −

2
3t2 e2A(φ)

which implies that although there is no pressure along the brane directions it must exist

along the ﬁfth dimension for an equilibrium to exist. This can be modeled by a pressureless

(particle) ﬂuid combined with non-fundamental string like ﬂuid with endpoints at the branes.

9

Tensions of both branes

In this case Ricci Scalar

and from (24) and (25) one can identify that

R(4D) =

4
3t2 .

U =

l

rt2 (cid:18)1 − exp(2π r

24πG5

l )

(cid:19) and V =

l

r

3rt2 (cid:16)exp(cid:16)2π

l(cid:17) − 1(cid:17) .

Now, by deﬁning U + V =

m
t2 , where G5 is dimensionless, then it can be shown that T1, the
tension of our brane universe, can be shaped up into the form of the tension of an E¨otv¨os

brane,

T1(t) = Kxc 1 −

t2/3
0

t2/3! .

On the other hand, from equation (23), the tension of strong brane is given by

T2(t) = −Kxc +

Kxct2/3

0

t2/3 −

m
2t2 .

This tension can be considered a generalization of the tension of an E¨otv¨os brane, with a

negative sign.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Using the modiﬁcation of energy momentum tensor of equation (20), we have shown

that it is possible the study the branes with temporally variable tension using Brane World

Sum Rules. Speciﬁcally we have studied branes with variable tensions that resemble E¨otv¨os

branes.

In particular we have shown an alternative to obtain the scale factors similar to the obtain

from FRW for the component individual of energy cases (matter, radiation and cosmological

constant cases).

Also we have shown three cases where the same scale factor is obtain from geometry 4D

and from tension of our brane universe. This cases are : FLRW 4D brane with radiacion

and matter domination on a 5D space, and dS4 (i.e de Sitter universe with exponential scale

factor) on a (A)dS5.

Finally it has been shown the diﬀerent values for the warp factor, the integral U, and

constraints for that U > 0 at the cases Λ5D → 0 and the (A)dS5 cases.
