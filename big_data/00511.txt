THE PROGENITOR OF GW 150914

Draft version March 3, 2016

ABSTRACT

The spectacular detection of gravitational waves from GW 150914 and its possible association with
a gamma-ray burst (GRB) oﬀer new insights into the evolution of massive stars. Here two possible
scenarios for producing the merging black holes are considered. One is based upon the chemically
homogeneous evolution of a rapidly rotating single star of 150 M(cid:12); the other on the delayed merger
of two black holes made by 70 and 90 M(cid:12) stars in a binary system. Any model in which a single
helium core produces a massive black hole must avoid premature explosion after encountering the pair
instability. Even with complete mixing and no mass loss, a star of over 133 M(cid:12) is required to produce
a black hole promptly. A single star model might also produce a gamma-ray burst to accompany the
GW signal, but the very short interval between the GW signal and the observed onset of the GRB in
GW 150914 is problematic.

INTRODUCTION

in.

The detection by Abbott et al. (2016a) of gravitational
radiation from a pair of merging massive black holes,
36+5−4 and 29+4−4 M(cid:12), has ushered in a new era of multi-
messenger astronomy. Possible models and implications
of the GW signal itself have been discussed by Abbott et
al. (2016b). Important as the signal from GW 150914 is
in its own right, the concurrent report of a short gamma-
ray burst commencing 0.4 s after the GW signal (Con-
naughton et al. 2016) has generated interest in making
both in a single stellar event. In particular, Loeb (2016)
has suggested that the collapse of a single, rapidly ro-
tating helium core inside a massive star might have led
to ﬁssion and merger with suﬃcient matter left over to
form a disk and make a GRB in GW 150914. The mass
of the collapsing core is not precisely speciﬁed by Loeb,
but needs to be at least large enough to provide the mass
of the two black holes, that is MHe >∼65 M(cid:12).

Well before the GW detection, Fryer et al. (2001) cal-
culated a single star model for a burst of gravitational
radiation accompanied by a GRB, but invoked a much
more massive star, 300 M(cid:12), with a 180 M(cid:12) helium core.
Their 2D results were unable to directly demonstrate the
ﬁssion of the collapsing core, but rotational energy and
angular momentum considerations suggested ﬁssion as a
likely outcome. Not having a realistic 3D model, the es-
timated energy in gravitational radiation from the Fryer
model was much weaker than was actually observed.
More recently, Reisswig et al. (2013) calculated,

in
three-dimensional detail, the collapse of rapidly rotating
supermassive stars (104 - 106 M(cid:12)), and actually observed
the ﬁssioning of the collapsed remnant. The common
theme in the works of Fryer and Reisswig was the direct
collapse of a rotating star to one or more black holes. Be-
cause the core mass was so large, burning stages beyond
carbon burning never occurred in hydrostatic equilibrium
and thermonuclear energy was inadequate to reverse the
implosion before the photodisintegration instability set

Here two new models for GW 150914 are brieﬂy pre-
sented. Both rely on 1D calculations of stellar evolution
and collapse using the KEPLER code. One is similar to
that of Fryer et al. (2001), but requires a main sequence
star only half as massive, 150 M(cid:12). With a bit more rota-
tion, this star evolves chemically homogeneously on the
main sequence to produce a helium star, also of ∼150
M(cid:12). The other model is based on the merger of two
black holes produced separately in a binary consisting of
70 and 90 M(cid:12) low metallicity stars. This latter model
oﬀers no clear route to making a GRB, but may be more
common in nature.

2. STELLAR MODELS

To guide the discussion and constrain speculation, a set
of models was calculated using the KEPLER code (Weaver,
Zimmerman, & Woosley 1978; Woosley et al. 2002, e.g.).
The models had in common a low metallicity, 10% that of
the sun, chieﬂy employed to keep the mass loss rates low.
Abbott et al. (2016b) have also suggested low metallicity
for the progenitor system. Using modern, but uncertain
mass loss rates (Nieuwenhuijzen & de Jager 1990), all
stars considered here would have lost their hydrogen en-
velopes and a good part of their helium cores as well.
Models starting with “T” in Table 1 were not rotating;
models starting with “R” included rotation. Speciﬁcally
Models R60, R70, and R110 had an equatorial rotation
speed on the main sequence of 160 - 180 km s−1 cor-
responding to a ratio of centrifugal force to gravity of
approximately 15%. These models did not experience
chemically homogeneous evolution, and their helium core
masses were substantially less than their ﬁnal masses. All
ended their lives as red supergiants. Since mass loss is
uncertain, some models were run both with and without
mass loss (A and B). The results show that the depen-
dency of ﬁnal helium core mass on the mass loss rate is
small so long as the entire envelope is not lost. No pulse
energies are given for Models T70 and R60 because the
they were very small and the envelope was not ejected.
The main sequence masses here were chosen to pro-
duce helium cores in the resulting presupernova star near

29 (Models T70 and R60) and 36 M(cid:12) (Models T90 and
R70) and 65 M(cid:12) (Models T150 and R110). The ﬁrst
two are similar to the masses of the merging black holes
calculated to produce the observed GW signal (Abbott
et al. 2016a). Model R150 is a case of more rapid rota-
tion on the main sequence, 350 km s−1, 25% of Keple-
rian. Its total angular momentum on the main sequence
was 7 × 1053 erg s and, since mass loss was neglected,
the star maintained this total angular momentum until
death. This was the minimum value required to produce
chemically homogeneous evolution using the settings in
the KEPLER code (Woosley & Heger 2006).

Table 1 also gives the mass loss rate and the masses of
the helium, carbon-oxygen, silicon, and iron cores for pre-
supernova stars, where an iron core in hydrostatic equi-
librium was eventually produced. Where an entry is not
given for the iron core mass, the star either exploded as
a pair-instability supernova (T150, R110) or collapsed
directly to a black hole (R150). Some of these stars en-
countered the pulsational-pair-instability in which case
the duration of the pulsing activity and the total kinetic
energy of matter ejected by the pulses is given. For those
that left a bound remnant, its mass is given.

3. SINGLE STAR MODELS FOR GW 150914

First consider any case where the helium core mass
in the single star is less than 133 M(cid:12). Helium cores of
this mass will explode, not collapse. Non-rotating he-
lium cores from 65 to 133 M(cid:12) explode as pair-instability
supernovae (Heger & Woosley 2002). Helium cores from
35 to 65 M(cid:12) encounter the pulsational-pair instability
(Woosley et al. 2007; Woosley & Heger 2015) and leave
bound cores of less than about 45 M(cid:12), less than observed
ﬁnal black hole mass. These cores of heavy elements then
evolve to iron core collapse. Iron cores in such stars, in all
calculations thus far, are less than 3 M(cid:12) (e.g., Table 1).
The calculations that include magnetic torques and make
iron cores (R60 and R70) also show far too little angular
momentum in their cores to cause ﬁssion. The inner 5
M(cid:12) of presupernova model R70 had a speciﬁc angular
momentum less than j = 3 × 1015 cm2 s−1. Finally the
hydrogen envelope, generally in a red supergiant, would
bury any potential GRB. Its relativistic energy would be
degraded and any electromagnetic transient would have
been observed long after the GW signal making the co-
incidence hard to determine. The GRB would also com-
mence with a longer delay after the GW signal than was
observed.

The limiting helium core masses for explosion by the

pair instability are unlikely to be greatly altered by in-
cluding rotation. The helium core experiences ∼300,000
years of almost fully convective helium burning before
collapsing and this does not rotate highly diﬀerentially.
Two-dimensional studies (Chatzopoulos & Wheeler 2012;
Chatzopoulos et al. 2013; Chen 2015) suggest only a
small modiﬁcation of the critical helium mass for mak-
ing a pair instability supernova. This is, in part, because
rotation cannot stabilize the polar axis from collapsing.
To circumvent these diﬃculties in a single helium star,
it is necessary to go to masses greater than about 133 M(cid:12)
(Heger & Woosley 2002). This might be easier than orig-
inally envisioned because chemically homogeneous evolu-
tion occurs when the rotation rate on the main sequence
is suﬃciently rapid to cause full mixing of the star, pri-
marily by Eddington Sweet circulation (Woosley & Heger
2006; Yoon et al. 2012; Chatzopoulos & Wheeler 2012;
K¨ohler et al. 2015). To illustrate this possibility, a 150
M(cid:12) low metallicity star endowed with very rapid rota-
tion was evolved without mass loss (Model R150, Ta-
ble 1). The technique was the same as in Woosley &
Heger (2006), except that the mass of the star was big-
ger. Neglecting mass loss makes this an extreme case
because such losses would decrease the angular momen-
tum and make the scenario less likely.
If mass loss in
Wolf-Rayet stars is metallicity sensitive though Vink &
de Koter (2005), then mass loss can be reduced to a toler-
able level. The assumed equatorial rotation speed on the
main sequence was 250 km s−1 or 18% of the Keplerian
speed, corresponding to a whole star angular momentum
of 7×1053 erg s. Magnetic torques were included, and the
star rotated almost rigidly during hydrogen and helium
burning. For the mixing parameters assumed, the star
remained fully mixed on the main sequence and ended
its short life of 2.7 My as a helium star, also of 150 M(cid:12).
Following 300,000 years of helium burning, the CO core
of 135 M(cid:12) encountered the pair instability and collapsed.
In the model studied, which did not include the braking
action of centrifugal force, the collapse continued to a
black hole.
The conditions in the collapsing star when the central
density reached 109 g cm−1 are shown in Fig. 1. This
density was chosen as being well short of neutrino trap-
ping, but also high enough that photodisintegration has
assured collapse to a black hole. The ratio of rotational
energy to binding energy is still well short of that re-
quired for triaxial deformation so this could serve as a
starting model for a 3D simulation. At this central den-
sity the ratio of rotational energy to gravitational binding

Fig. 1.— A 150 M(cid:12) model (R150) evolved including suﬃcient an-
gular momentum that it experiences complete mixing on the main
sequence and dies as a core of helium, carbon, and oxygen of 150
M(cid:12). At the point shown, the carbon-oxygen core has encountered
the pair instability and is collapsing to a black hole. The central
density is 109 g cm−3, the central temperature, 15.3 GK, and most
positive nuclear energy generation has ended in the star. The inner
∼70 M(cid:12) has photodisintegrated to helium and the inner 10 M(cid:12)
to nucleons, a large energy sink that is accelerating the collapse
which is already near 109 cm s−1. The inﬂection at the outer edge
is due to explosive helium burning. Within this collapsing core
the Kerr parameter, calculated for the mass interior to a given
Lagrangian coordinate varies from a = 2 near the center to a =
3.5 at the surface. The ratio of rotational energy to gravitational
binding energy, T/W, for a given fraction of the mass varies from
6% near the center to 11% at the edge. The core is still far from
ﬁssioning, but its continued collapse to higher density and T/W is
assured. Angular momentum transport has led to the outer 5 M(cid:12)
or so having greater than Keplerian speed, i.e., it would be ejected.

energy was about 5% throughout the star. By the time
the central density reached 1011 g cm−3, however, T/W
exceeds 20% in the inner 10 M(cid:12), and was greater than
12% everywhere in the star. The Kerr parameter was
substantially greater than unity throughout the entire
core, guaranteeing that angular momentum will be lost,
either through a disk or ﬁssion and gravitational radia-
tion, before even a maximally rotating black hole forms
The subsequent evolution would probably be similar to
that of the 180 M(cid:12) core of Fryer et al. (2001, Compare
with their Fig. 3) in 2D and, possibly, to the calculations
of Reisswig et al. (2013) in 3D.

This model has the merit of possibly providing not only
the gravitational wave signal (Reisswig et al. 2013), but
also having residual matter that would form an accretion
disk and possibly make a GRB as envisioned by Mac-
Fadyen & Woosley (1999) and Loeb (2016). It also lacks
any hydrogenic envelope which would interfere with the
production and observability of the GRB. Even in this
case though, one expects a signiﬁcant delay, ∼ 10 s, be-

tween the GW signal and the GRB (e.g. Zhang et al.
2004) and why such a delay is not seen is puzzling.

4. A BINARY MODEL FOR GW 150914

Alternatively, One could just make the two black holes
separately in a binary system and bring them together by
a combination of common envelope evolution and grav-
itational radiation.
It is more diﬃcult to produce the
observed GRB in this model.

4.1. The Components

As Table 1 shows for metal-deﬁcient stars, the natural
progenitors for black holes of 29 M(cid:12) and 36 M(cid:12) are sin-
gle main sequence stars near 70 and 90 M(cid:12). Including a
moderate amount of rotation, 165 - 180 km s−1 on the
main sequence, reduces these main sequence masses to
approximately 60 and 70 M(cid:12). More relevant than the
main sequence masses are the helium core masses at the
time the stars die, approximately 30 and 40 M(cid:12), respec-
tively.

Evolved alone and without rotation, a star like T90A
encounters the pulsational-pair instability at carbon de-
pletion. This results in a series of a dozen strong ther-
monuclear pulses occurring during the last 106 s of the
star’s life (Fig 2). Following each ﬂash, the core expands,
emits a shock wave into the hydrogen envelope, then re-
laxes, and encounters the pair instability again. These

ﬂashes derive their energy from explosive oxygen and sil-
icon burning in the inner 5 M(cid:12) of the core. Eventually
the pulses eject the envelope leaving most of the helium
core intact and stable against further pulsation. The
residual core of 35.9 M(cid:12) evolves to produce an iron core
of 2.57 M(cid:12) (Model T90A) or 2.86 M(cid:12) (Model T90B).
While the subsequent evolution of the iron core was not
followed here, given its large size and the shallow density
gradient outside, it is extremely unlikely to explode by
neutrino transport (Ertl et al. 2016, e.g.). Lacking rota-
tion, the protoneutron star accretes for perhaps a second
and becomes a black hole. The remaining core of helium
and heavy elements quickly accretes into the hole. The
baryonic mass of the collapsed remnant is 35.9 M(cid:12) for
Model T90A and 37.1 M(cid:12) for Model T90B, though a few
tenths of a solar mass might be subtracted because of the
neutrino losses during the protoneutron star phase.

The velocity structure at the time when the iron core of
T90A collapses is shown in Fig. 2. Despite the collapse
of the core to a black hole, the shock waves from the
pulses propagate into the hydrogen envelope long after
the core has collapsed, and ultimately eject it with a
kinetic energy ∼ 5 × 1050 erg (Table 1). This leads to
a rather ordinary Type IIp supernova lasting about 200
days with a luminosity on the plateau of about 2 × 1042
erg s−1.

Adding rotation to the model does not change the qual-
itative result, though it does alter the main sequence
mass required to produce the given black hole mass.
Model R70 produces a helium core of 37.4 M(cid:12) that also
encounters the pulsational-pair instability and ejects its
hydrogen envelope and a portion of the core. In the end,
a remnant with baryonic mass 34.5 M(cid:12) is left and the
hydrogen envelope is ejected producing a Type IIp su-
pernova. Following the transport of angular momentum
that happens during carbon, neon, and oxygen burning
and in the pulses, including magnetic torques, gives an
angular momentum in the collapsing core of less than
1016 cm2 s−1 in the inner 20 M(cid:12). Even at the edge of
the helium core, j is only 4 × 1016 cm2 s−1. The core
collapses to a black hole and does not form a disk.

The evolution of the lighter component, as exempli-
ﬁed by Model T70A, is similar, but less explosive. This
star encounters a weak pulsational-pair instability in its
oxygen shell during the waning hour of its life, but the
pulses are too weak to eject even the loosely bound en-
velope. The 30.1 M(cid:12) helium core collapses directly to
a black hole leaving most of its envelope still bound. In
a single star system without rotation, the envelope too
would accrete over a period of days, ﬁnally producing a
black hole of 55.5 M(cid:12) (Table 1).

4.2. Binary Evolution

Now consider these two stars interacting in a binary
system with initial separation of order 1 AU. On the main
sequence, the stellar radii are suﬃciently small, 8.4×1011
cm and 9.8 × 1011 cm for Models T70A and T90A, that
the stars evolve individually. When T90A starts to burn
helium however, it ﬁlls its Roche lobe and starts to spill
over onto Model T70A. Further rapid expansion initiates
a ﬁrst phase of common envelope evolution (Izzard et al.
2012, e.g.). T90A expands to 0.5 AU when its central
helium abundance 0.978, and to 1 AU 12,000 years later,
when the helium abundance is 0.923. The binding energy

of the 11.7 M(cid:12) of envelope external to 1012 cm at that
(R = 1 AU) point is 6 × 1049 erg, but as the star con-
tinues to expand, the binding of the envelope decreases.
For the presupernova star, the binding energy external to
1012 cm, which includes most of the hydrogen envelope,
is 1.6× 1049 erg. This is less than the gravitational bind-
ing energy of the binary, even at 1 AU. The radius of the
presupernova star is 12.5 AU, so envelope ejection dur-
ing the common envelope phase is at least energetically
feasible.

After 310,000 years of convective core helium burn-
ing T90A encounters the pulsational pair instability and
ejects any residual common envelope in a supernova. The
mass lost is a small fraction of the remaining system, so
T70A and the black hole stay bound. At this point one
has a 35.9 M(cid:12) black hole (Fig 2) in orbit with a 66 M(cid:12)
star that is just completing hydrogen burning. This as-
sumes that negligible mass accreted on T70A during the
Roche lobe overﬂow and common envelope evolution. If
substantial mass did accrete, then the same desired end
result, i.e., the same ﬁnal helium core mass, could be ob-
tained by invoking a lighter star than 70 M(cid:12) on the main
sequence.

Now that the common envelope is gone, T70 can begin
to accrete onto the black hole, temporarily forming an
ultra-luminous x-ray source (Jonker & Nelemans 2004).
T70 itself ignites helium burning 55,000 years after birth
of the black hole and expands to 1 AU 130,000 years
later. Sometime during this interval, a second common
envelope develops that includes the black hole and the
helium core (radius about 1 R(cid:12)) of T70A. Helium burn-
ing lasts a total of 340,000 years in T70A, during which
time the common envelope is probably lost, but T70A
too ﬁnally dies with a helium core mass of 30.1 M(cid:12). Its
helium core pulsations are weak, so the entire core im-
plodes to a black hole of ∼30 M(cid:12) (Table 1). By now
the two black holes may be substantially less than 1012
cm apart. Gravitational radiation brings them together
in less than 1 billion years, perhaps much less, and they
merge.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Two evolutionary models are given for GW 150914, one
based upon a single, rapidly rotating star, the other on
the merger of two black holes formed in a binary that ex-
periences common envelope evolution. All models based
upon single stars must have, at the time they die, helium
cores in excess of about 133 M(cid:12). The model used here
had a helium core close to 150 M(cid:12). This massive core
was achieved by the chemically homogeneous evolution
of a star also near 150 M(cid:12) on the main sequence. Suf-
ﬁcient angular momentum existed in this star when it
died that ﬁssion seems very likely. The collapse also oc-
curs in a helium star that lacks a hydrogen envelope and
has considerable remaining mass that could form a disk
around the merged black holes and produce a relativis-
tic jet. Even in this optimal model for making a GRB
though, one must be concerned that the GRB should
lag the GW signal by ∼10 s and not be as coincident as
was reported (0.4 s). This is because the jet must move
subrelativistically through the helium core before exiting
and making the burst (Zhang et al. 2004). It cannot be
ruled out that the rotationally induced geometry, and es-
pecially ﬁssion during the collapse will reduce the time

required for the sub-relativistic jet to break out along the
rotational axis, but this has yet to be demonstrated.

Given this problem with making the GRB and the un-
certainty associated with chemically homogeneous evo-
lution, an alternate model was explored based upon the
evolution of a binary system of a 70 M(cid:12) and 90 M(cid:12)
main sequence stars. Slightly lower masses would give
the same result if rotation were included and the mass,
especially of the 70 M(cid:12) star is uncertain because of the
unknown accretion that goes on in the common envelope
stage. This scenario leads to the merger of detached
black holes in a more traditional way but oﬀers no clear
path to making a GRB. In its favor, if a relativistic jet
were made, the GRB could commence immediately as
experiment requires. The disk mass required is not large
and might be present in the form of fossil disks around

the merging black holes. No clear path exists for ionizing
these disks though and endowing them with the neces-
sary magnetic ﬁelds. Their dynamics during the merger
is also unclear.
