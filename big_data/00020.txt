Abstract: We report the characterization of a massive planet (mp = 4.4 ± 1.6Mjup) orbiting an M dwarf
host (M = 0.37 ± 0.14M⊙) at a distance of 0.6+0.4
−0.2 kpc toward the Galactic bulge, with planet host
projected separation a⊥ ∼ 1.2 AU. The characterization was made possible by the wide-ﬁeld (4 deg2) high
cadence (Γ = 6 hr−1) monitoring of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), which had
two of its three telescopes in commissioning operations at the time of the planetary anomaly. The source
crossing time t∗ = 16 min is among the shortest ever published. The high-cadence, wide-ﬁeld observations
that are the hallmark of KMTNet are the only way to routinely capture such short crossings. High-cadence
resolution of short caustic crossings will preferentially lead to mass and distance measurements for the lens.
This is because the short crossing time typically implies a nearby lens, which enables the measurement
of additional eﬀects (bright lens and/or microlens parallax). When combined with the measured crossing
time, these eﬀects can yield complete solutions.
Key words: gravitational microlensing – planets

1. INTRODUCTION

The Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet;
Kim et al. 2016) is a system of three 1.6m telescopes,
each equipped with a 4 deg2 340-Mpixel camera, located
in Chile, South Africa, and Australia. The system was
designed to conduct a microlensing survey that would
detect Earth-mass planets without additional followup
data. While microlensing events typically last for tens of
days, many of their most interesting features occur on
much shorter timescales, especially features that per-
mit the detection and characterization of planets, which
have typical perturbation times

the suggestion of Gould & Loeb (1992). Surveys would
monitor the Galactic bulge at a relatively low cadence
(e.g., once per night) that is adequate for the discovery
of microlensing events. This would enable them to cover
the widest possible area, which is necessary to detect a
large sample of microlensing events in spite of their low
frequency Γ ∼ 10−5yr−1 star−1, but would not gener-
ally permit the detection of planets. Hence, the survey
teams would have to alert the community to these events
in real time, allowing followup networks to initiate high-
cadence monitoring of individual events. A spectacular
example of the success of this approach was the dis-
covery of the Sun/Jupiter/Saturn analog OGLE-2006-
BLG-109Lb, (Gaudi et al., 2008; Bennett et al., 2010).
See Gould et al. (2010) for a thorough review of this ap-
proach. Despite its successes, this approach of combin-
ing survey and followup observations is highly ineﬃcient
and allows only a small subset of events to be observed
with a high enough cadence to detect planets.

In 2004, Cheongho Han initiated discussions with col-

leagues that led to the design of a completely new ap-
proach: construct very wide-ﬁeld cameras on the three
southern continents. By virtue of their large ﬁelds of
view, these telescopes could both monitor very wide ar-
eas and do so at a rapid cadence (i.e., several times
per hour). Their geographic distribution would allow
nearly continuous coverage of events. Thus, such a
survey would not only detect microlensing events but
would also be able to characterize planetary perturba-
tions. Hence, this approach allows all events to be mon-
itored for planets and eliminates the need for real-time
followup observations.

A natural consequence is that all features in the mi-
crolensing light curve are automatically monitored at
this high cadence. Aside from just detecting the plane-
tary perturbations, it is important to capture the caus-
tic crossings because, if they are resolved, they provide
crucial additional information about the lens. Caustic
crossings occur in the great majority of published plane-
tary and binary events. While there is some publication
bias hidden in this statistic, detailed simulations show
that even with systematics-free data, at least half of
all recognizable planetary events have caustic crossings
(Zhu et al., 2014, 2015).

The duration of the crossing allows one to determine

the normalized source size

ρ =

θ∗
θE

;

θE ≡ pκM πrel;

κ ≡

4G
c2AU ≃ 8.14

mas
M⊙

(2)
where θ∗ is the angular radius of the source, θE is
the Einstein radius, M is the lens mass, and πrel =
AU(D−1
S ) is the lens-source relative parallax.
Since θ∗ is almost always measurable by standard tech-
niques (Yoo et al., 2004), this yields a measurement of
θE and thus of the product M πrel, which can be a crucial
constraint in the interpretation of the lens.

L − D−1

Typical source sizes are θ∗ = 0.6 µas, and typical lens-
source relative proper motions are µrel = 4 mas yr−1.
Hence, caustic crossing times are similar in duration to
Earth-mass planetary perturbations

tcc = t∗ sec φ,

where t∗ is the source self-crossing time, tcc is the caustic
crossing time and φ is the angle of crossing. Hence,
resolving a caustic crossing requires the same cadence
as detecting Earth-mass planets.

Although considerable eﬀort is exerted by followup
groups to monitor caustic crossings of “interesting”
events, in practice this is diﬃcult and suﬀers from many
of the same problems as followup searches for planets.
At least half of all caustic crossings (i.e., caustic en-
trances) are essentially impossible to predict from the
pre-crossing light curve, and a fair fraction of the rest
are quite diﬃcult to predict. Many caustic crossings
occur when they are unobservable from Earth due to
sidereal time or weather. Moreover, many events that
turn out to be “interesting” are not recognized as such

until after the time of the crossing. This makes high-
cadence, round-the-clock surveys such as KMTNet a
game-changer for planetary and binary science.

Here we present a planetary microlensing event,
OGLE-2015-BLG-0954, that showcases KMTNet’s abil-
ity to resolve unexpected caustic crossings of exception-
ally short duration. We show that capturing the cross-
ing was crucial to the interpretation of this planetary
system.

2. KMTNET

The three KMTNet telescopes were all commissioned in
the 2015 bulge season, taking their ﬁrst scientiﬁc data
in March, February, and June, respectively. During this
commissioning season, they simultaneously took scien-
tiﬁc data and underwent various engineering tests and
adjustments. While the system was only fully opera-
tional at the end of the season, the data quality are
generally quite high. For example, these data played an
important role in the characterization of the massive-
remnant binary candidate OGLE-2015-BLG-1285La,b
(Shvartzvald et al., 2015).

The system is designed to monitor a large ﬁeld at
a rapid cadence. The pixel scale was optimized for mi-
crolensing at 0.4′′ to cover the widest possible area while
still being Nyquist sampled at typical good seeing at the
best site (Chile). The cadence was selected based on
Equation (1) which shows that it should be of order 4–
6 hr−1 to enable approximately a dozen measurements
over the perturbation time of an Earth-mass planet
Indeed simulations by Henderson et al.
2tp,⊕ ∼ 3 hr.
(2014) show that as one increases the observing area
(and correspondingly decreases the cadence) with a
KMTNet-like system, the number of planet detections
of all types increases at ﬁrst. However, at cadences of
about 5 hr−1, the number of Earth detections reaches a
maximum while the detections of more massive planets
continues to rise. Hence, the survey strategy adopted
in 2015 was to observe 4 ﬁelds (so 16 deg2) at about
6 hr−1. In addition, other ﬁelds were also observed at
much lower cadence in pursuit of other science objec-
tives.

3. OGLE-2015-BLG-0954’S UNFORESEEN CAUSTIC

CROSSING

On 10 May 2015,
the Optical Gravitational Lens
Experiment (OGLE) Early Warning System (EWS,
Udalski et al. 1994; Udalski 2003) alerted the microlens-
ing community to a new event, OGLE-2015-BLG-0954
at (α, δ)=(18:00:44.24,−28:39:39.2), (l, b) = (1.9,−2.7).
At HJD′ = 7164.62 (UT 02:45 22 May) the event began
a caustic entrance, which led to a jump of about 1 mag-
nitude between the ﬁrst and second OGLE points of the
night, which were separated by 105 minutes. These were
posted to the EWS website when OGLE next updated
it, shortly after UT 15:01 22 May, i.e. HJD′ = 7165.12,
which happened to be almost exactly the time of the
end of the caustic exit HJD′ = 7165.15. Hence, there
was essentially no time to organize observations of the

KMTNet Super-Jupiter

caustic exit. In any case, there were no such attempts
of which we are aware.

4. OBSERVATIONS

KMTNet
scientiﬁc observations commenced on 10
March, 21 February, and 20 June in Chile (CTIO),
South Africa (SAAO), and Australia (SSO), respec-
tively. Overall the data from CTIO, SAAO, and SSO are
of good science quality, but the commissioning observa-
tions were impacted by a variety of engineering-related
issues ranging from breaks in the schedule to adjustment
of the detector electronics.
In the case of the CTIO
data there are two times when the detector electronics
changed substantially. We therefore ﬁt the CTIO light
curves as three independent curves (to avoid introduc-
ing artifacts into long term eﬀects, particularly paral-
lax), with breaks at HJD′ = 7130 and HJD′ = 7192.
We also note that because the SSO observations began
well after the caustic crossing, they do not contribute
substantially to the analysis, but are included for com-
pleteness.

The majority of data at CTIO and all the data at
SAAO and SSO were taken in I-band, with respectively
2132, 1350, and 449 points included in this study. V -
band observations were made in Chile only, for the pur-
pose of determining the source color. See Section 6. The
ratio of V :I observations in Chile is about 1:5. Only the
second segment of Chile data were used for this pur-
pose because this is the only segment that has suﬃcient
ﬂux variation to accurately constrain the source color.
There are 113 V -band points that could be matched to
a corresponding I-band point within 1.2 hours and so
are used in this color determination.

Observations during the caustic crossing were taken in
quite unstable weather conditions. The crossing lasted
2tcc = 33 min. Of the three points taken during this
crossing, one image could not be reduced and the re-
maining two have formal errors that are respectively 3
and 2 times larger than typical errors at the same bright-
ness during the rest of the night. Conditions recovered
immediately after the caustic entrance. KMTNet policy
is to take observations regardless of seeing and with up
to 6 magnitudes of extinction by clouds. The great ma-
jority of observations taken in poor conditions are “use-
less” in the sense that the information content of neigh-
boring points far exceeds that of these poor-condition
data. However, as Lao Tzu1 foretold, these “useless”
data can prove crucial.

The modeling was conducted based on reduc-
tions using image subtraction (Albrow et al., 2009;
Alard & Lupton, 1998).
(Schechter et al.,
1993) reductions were used to determine the source color
and magnitude.

model. With the exception of a brief half-day eruption
at peak, the light curve looks qualitatively like a stan-
dard point lens event that might adequately be param-
eterized by just three parameters, (t0, u0, tE), i.e., the
time of lens-source closest approach, the impact param-
eter (normalized to θE), and the Einstein crossing time.
The caustics at peak imply that this is a binary or plan-
etary lens, which then requires three more parameters
(s, q, α), the separation of the two masses (normalized
to θE), their mass ratio, and their orientation relative
to the lens-source proper motion µrel. The fact that the
caustic entrance is resolved means that the normalized
source radius ρ is also required for the model.
In ad-
dition, source and blend ﬂuxes (fs, fb) must be ﬁt for
each independent data set (3 from CTIO and 1 each
from SAAO and SSO). We conduct a broad search over
(s, q) geometries, allowing the other ﬁve parameters to
vary continuously from seed solutions that are well sam-
pled in α. We ﬁnd only two local minima, which are
related by the well known close/wide binary degeneracy
(Griest & Saﬁzadeh, 1998; Dominik, 1999). The param-
eters for these two solutions are given in Table 1.

There are two major striking features of these so-
lutions. First, the planet/star mass ratio is 0.011 (or
0.012), i.e., about 11 or 12 times that of Jupiter/Sun.
Second, the self-crossing time is extremely quick,

to make use of the useless.”

6. COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAM

Figure 2 is a calibrated color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) showing ﬁeld stars within 90′′ of the lens from
the OGLE-III catalog (Szymaski et al., 2011) together
with the source position determined from the model pre-
sented in Section 5, as well as the blend.

We ﬁrst measure the source in an instrumental system
based on DoPhot photometry using regression for the
(V −I) color and a ﬁt to the best model for the I magni-
tude, respectively. We then put these on the OGLE-III
system via a transformation derived from common ﬁeld
stars. We ﬁnd ((V − I), I)s = (2.01± 0.05, 20.99± 0.06),
where the error in the color is due to the scatter in the
photometric data, while the error in the magnitude is
primarily due to a highly correlated ∼ 6% error in the
parameters (fs, u0, tE, q, ρ). See Table 1 and Yee et al.
(2012). To derive the calibrated blend (i.e., non-source)
light, we subtract the ﬂuxes corresponding to these mag-
nitudes from those of the OGLE-III star at this po-
sition, with ((V − I), I)base = (1.69, 18.36) to obtain.
((V − I), I)b = (1.66, 18.46). The errors in these quan-
tities are essentially the same as those of the baseline
ﬂux, the blend ﬂuxes are almost the same as the baseline
ﬂuxes. We estimate these as 0.07 and 0.02 magnitudes
respectively.

Assuming that the source is behind the same amount
of dust as the clump, we can determine its intrinsic
color and magnitude and use those values to deter-
mine θE. First, we measure the position of the red
clump:
((V − I), I)cl = (1.87, 15.41). Given the in-
trinsic clump position ((V − I), I)0,cl = (1.06, 14.38)
(Bensby et al., 2013; Nataf et al., 2013), we then de-
rive ((V − I), I)0,s = (1.20, 19.96). Then using the
V IK color-color relations of Bessell & Brett (1988) and
the color-surface brightness relations of Kervella et al.
(2004), we derive an angular source radius,

θ∗ = 0.55 µas.

microlensed source (black) and the blended light (green) rel-
ative to the centroid of the red clump (red). The ﬁeld stars
are taken from the OGLE-III catalog (Szymaski et al., 2011).
The source color and magnitude are derived in an instrumen-
tal DoPhot system, and then transformed to the OGLE-III
system using ﬁeld stars. The blended light is derived by sub-
tracting the source (V, I) ﬂuxes from the (V, I) ﬂuxes of the
baseline object found in the OGLE-III catalog.

The resulting angular size of the Einstein ring and lens-
source relative proper motion are

All three quantities have the same 9% error, which we
calculate as follows. The 6% modeling ﬂux error con-
tributes half (Yee et al., 2009), i.e., 3%. Centroiding the
clump in I contributes 4%. There is a 0.05 mag measure-
ment error in the color and another 0.06 mag error in
deriving the surface temperature from the microlensing
color (Bensby et al., 2013), which together propagate to
a 6% error. Finally, there is a 5% error from propagating
the scatter in the V IK relations.

7. THE NATURE OF THE LENS

7.1. A Nearby Lens

The measured θE, blended light, and proper motion
strongly imply a nearby lens.

7.1.1. θE and the CMD

We can conclude with near certainty that lens is in the
near disk from the large Einstein radius combined with
limits on light due to the lens based on the measured
blended light. The θE measurement provides a con-
straint from θ2

E = κM πrel, i.e.,

M = (1.0 ± 0.18)M⊙(cid:18) πrel

0.47 mas(cid:19)−1

(7)

KMTNet Super-Jupiter

Suppose that the lens were a M = 1 M⊙ star, and
therefore at 1.7 kpc. Even if it were behind the same
amount of dust as the clump (AI = 1.05, Nataf et al.
2013) and were somewhat subluminous at MI = 4.5,
it would be I ∼ 16.7, about 1.75 mag brighter than
the observed blend.
it would be some-
what bluer. Essentially the same argument applies to
any host M & 0.25 M⊙ (i.e, πrel = 1.89 mas, MI ∼ 9
⇒ I = 18.53).

In addition,

Note that at the limit M = 0.25M⊙, the photomet-
ric constraint from the blended light would still not be
truly satisﬁed. That is, although the lens would con-
tribute less than the observed I-band light, the color
would still be wrong. Such a star would contribute only
about 15% of the observed V-band light, meaning the
other 85% would then have to be supplied by another
star. Of course, there could be such an object, but it
would itself contribute substantial I-band light. When
combined with the lens light, the total light would then
exceed the limit unless the lens were yet fainter than we
have just supposed.

On the other hand, if θE were 2-sigma smaller, this
would allow for smaller πrel at ﬁxed mass, and hence, a
more distant lens. This consequent 0.4 mag reduction in
ﬂux from the lens would provide the necessary margin
to accommodate light from an additional star.

Taking all of these considerations into account, we
therefore regard M < 0.25M⊙ as a conservative photo-
metric upper limit on the host mass. This gives a cor-
responding upper limit on the lens distance of 0.5 kpc.
This leads to the conclusion that the lens is a very-low
mass, nearby object and may even be a brown dwarf.

The only exception to this line of reasoning would
be stellar remnants, either white dwarfs, neutron stars,
or black holes. These are generally believed to have few
planets so we do not further pursue this possibility here.
As we discuss in Section 8.3, if future observations show
that the lens is not contributing to the blend light then
this question should be revisited.

7.1.2. Lens-Source Relative Proper Motion

lens-source

The
relative proper motion, µrel =
18 mas yr−1 (Equation(6)), also suggests a nearby lens.
This value is much higher than for typical bulge lenses
(∼ 4 mas yr−1) or far-disk lenses (∼ 7 mas yr−1), which
are dominated by internal stellar motions in the bulge
and the ﬂat rotation curve of the Galaxy, respec-
tively. However, the proper motions of very nearby
lenses are dominated by their peculiar motion, vpec ∼
O(50 km s−1), i.e., µrel → vpec/DL. This can be ar-
bitrarily large for suﬃciently nearby lenses. For ex-
ample, the extremely nearby lens OGLE-2007-BLG-
224 (DL = 0.5 kpc) had a record proper motion of
µrel = 48 mas yr−1 (Gould et al., 2009). While the ob-
served proper motion does not deﬁnitively rule out ei-
ther the bulge-lens or far-disk lens scenarios, it is most
easily explained by a nearby lens.

7.2. Lens Properties

Given that the lens is nearby, we can estimate its mass
and distance based on the velocity distribution of stars
in the nearby disk. The projected transverse velocity
˜v ≡ AUµrel/πrel is typically 50 km s−1, and the lens
mass is related to ˜v by

M =

c2
4G

˜vtEθE → 0.28 M⊙

˜v

50 km s−1 ,

(8)

where we have substituted in the best ﬁt values for θE
and tE in the last step. Similarly,

πrel =

AUµrel

˜v → 1.7 mas(cid:18)

˜v

50 km s−1(cid:19)−1

(9)

Since, the rms projected velocity of nearby stars is ˜v ∼
50 km s−1, these are plausible ﬁrst estimates for the lens
mass and relative parallax. They are roughly consistent
with the upper limits derived in Section 7.1.1.

However, we can also make a purely kinematic esti-
mate ignoring the ﬂux constraints. This is appropriate
either to allow for dark (or very dim hosts) such as white
dwarfs, or to allow for larger-than-expected errors in θE
(which entered these constraints), due to either large
statistical ﬂuctuations or to unrecognized systematic er-
rors.

To do so, we must also weight our results to account
for the transformation between microlensing parameters
and the physical parameters of the system. This ac-
counts for the underlying bias of the observations to-
ward more distant and thus (given that M πrel = θ2
E/κ
is measured) more massive lenses.

For ﬁxed (i.e., measured) θE and µrel, the proba-
bility is weighted by the volume element (dDL D2
L)
as well as the stellar density variation (which in the
present case is minor). Approximating the projected
velocity distribution as a Gaussian with 1-D dispersion
σ = 50 km s−1/√2, one may write,

hMi = R dDL[DL(˜v)]2M (˜v)˜v exp(−˜v2/2σ2)
R dDL[DL(˜v)]2˜v exp(−˜v2/2σ2)

,

(10)

where M and DL are regarded as implicit functions of ˜v
through Equations (8) and (9), respectively. Then using
the near-ﬁeld approximation DL → AU/πrel, one may
easily derive

M =

c2
4G

√2σ(cid:18) 3√π

4 (cid:19)tEθE → 0.37 ± 0.14 M⊙

and similarly for πrel,

πrel =

AUµrel√2σ (cid:18)√π

2 (cid:19) → 1.5 ± 0.6 mas.

(11)

(12)

These estimates are consistent at the 1 sigma level
with the host-mass limit M < 0.25 M⊙ that was derived
in Section 7.1.1 and also at the 1.5 sigma level with
typical white-dwarf masses. In Section 8.3, we discuss
how this ambiguity can be resolved. Until that time, we

6

Shin, Ryu, Albrow, et al.

adopt the above kinematic estimates, which straddles
both cases. Then, combining Equation (11) with the
planet-star mass ratio q = 0.0115 (average of the two
solutions) yields an estimated planet mass,

shorter than such upper main-sequence stars, the prob-
ability of such a companion is about 1.5%, i.e., similar
to the ﬁrst scenario.

mplanet = 4.4 ± 1.6 Mjup.

8.2.3. Blend as the Host

When high-resolution imaging resolves the nature of the
host (Section 8.3), this estimate can be made more pre-
cise.

Because the distance uncertainty is roughly 30% and
the two solutions (wide and close) are roughly equally
likely, the estimates of the projected separation from
these two solutions overlap. We therefore estimate

a⊥ = DLθEs → 1.2 ± 0.6 AU.

(14)

Note that while some of this large uncertainty can be
removed by resolving the host, the dichotomy between
close and wide solutions will remain.

8. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE BLENDED LIGHT?

8.1. Astrometry

To probe the relation of the blended light to the event,
we ﬁrst determine whether or not it is coincident with
the position of the lens by measuring the centroid of the
source-blend combined light. We compare the apparent
position of the source-blend combined light when the
source is highly magniﬁed on HJD′ ∼ 7187.7 (when the
source accounts for 65% of the total light) to its posi-
tion near baseline (when it accounts for about 13%). To
do so, we consider 33 CTIO images with seeing FWHM
< 1.35′′, including 7 from the above mentioned highly
magniﬁed night and 26 that are at least 25 days from
peak (so magniﬁed A < 1.8). Because the baseline ob-
ject is relatively isolated (with only one relevant near-
neighbor, which is at 1.4′′), we ﬁt directly to the ﬂux
counts of individual pixels in the vicinity of the lens,
taking account of this neighbor.

We ﬁnd that the oﬀset between these two groups is
60 ± 25 mas and 0 ± 27 mas in the East and North di-
rections. This implies separations between the source
and blend of 120 ± 50 mas and 0 ± 54 mas, respectively.
Hence, there is no clear evidence that the blended light
is displaced from the source, and the two lie projected
within about 200 mas.

8.2. Four Possible Origins of Blended Light

8.2.1. Blend as Unrelated Star

There are 3500 stars brighter than the blend within 90′′
of the lens. Hence, the chance of one of these being
projected within 200 mas is 3500 × (0.2/90)2 = 1.7%.
While this probability is small, such random projection
is not implausible.

8.2.2. Blend as Companion to the Source

Another possibility is that the blend is a subgiant com-
panion to the source. Roughly 15% of G dwarfs have
companions Mcomp/MG > 0.8 and with semimajor axes
a . 200 mas× 8 kpc = 1600 AU (Raghavan et al., 2010).

The remaining possibility is that the blend is part of the
lens system, either the host itself or a companion to it
that is too far separated to inﬂuence the magniﬁcation.
It is diﬃcult to come up with a plausible host that
explains the blended light for reasons that are closely
related to the fact that the blended light places upper
limits on the host light, as discussed in Section 7.1.1. For
example, if the blend were behind all the dust, then its
color would imply a late G dwarf of mass M ∼ 0.9 M⊙.
Identifying this star with the host would then imply, via
Equation (7), DL = 1.5 kpc, and so MI = 6.5. This is
substantially too dim for typical late G dwarfs. On the
other hand, if the lens were in front of all the dust, its
color would imply a late K dwarf, M ∼ 0.6 M⊙ and
so (assuming it were the host) πrel = θ2
E/κM = 0.8 mas,
i.e., DL ∼ 1.1 kpc and so MI = 8.3. This is substantially
too dim for late K dwarfs.

8.2.4. Blend as Companion to the Host

Another possibility is that the blended light is a com-
panion to the host. However, it is also not easy to ar-
range for this scenario. For example, if the blend is
in front of all the dust, then its color implies a late K
dwarf, so MI ∼ 6. Then its apparent magnitude implies
DL = 3 kpc, and so πrel ∼ 0.2 mas But then the host
would be M ∼ 2.5 M⊙, which would be seen (unless it
were a dark remnant).
Hence, although the probabilities for a random inter-
loper and a companion to the source are modest, these
are the most likely scenarios.

8.3. Resolution

Several types of information can be assembled on var-
ious timescales to resolve the nature of the host. First, it
should be possible to immediately measure the heliocen-
tric proper motion of the baseline-object using OGLE-
III data (e.g., Skowron et al. 2013). If the proper mo-
tion is high, then it is very likely that the blended light
is either the host itself or that it is a companion to the
host. We recall that in interpreting this measurement
one must account for the diﬀerence between heliocentric
and geocentric proper motion,

µhel − µgeo = v⊕,⊥

πrel
AU

= (0.29, 5.41)

πrel
yr

(15)

where we have substituted in the value of v⊕,⊥, Earth’s
instantaneous projected velocity at the peak of the
event, in (north,east) coordinates. For example, if the
lens were at πrel = 2 mas, this diﬀerence would be more
than 10 mas yr−1.

High resolution imaging of the lens system would yield
more deﬁnitive information. Immediate high resolution

KMTNet Super-Jupiter

imaging could determine whether the blend is signif-
icantly oﬀset from the source with much better con-
straints than we found in Section 8.1.
If the blend is
indeed separated by ∆θ = 120 mas, it would easily be
resolved. If the high-resolution imaging is done in the
optical (e.g., with the Hubble Space Telescope) and if
the blend is separated from the source, then one could
subtract the source ﬂux (known from the microlensing
solution) from the combined light at the position of the
source, in order to measure the ﬂux of the lens (or at
least put much better limits on it). Since the lens is mov-
ing at µrel = 18 mas yr−1, it could be resolved within 4
years (Batista et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2015). More-
over, if the blend is now separated from the source, com-
bined ﬁrst plus second epoch of high-resolution imaging
could determine whether the blend has the same proper
motion as the host and so is a companion to it.

If the host is a white dwarf of, e.g., M = 0.6 M⊙, then
it will be at DL ∼ 1.1 kpc. Depending on its age and
the instrument with which it is observed, it will likely
be either very faint or invisible. However, in either case
this would be an important discovery. And in the lat-
ter case, deeper observations could then be undertaken
to discriminate between brown dwarf and white dwarf
scenarios.

9. CONCLUSION

High-cadence Γ = 6 hr−1 observations by KMTNet re-
solved the extremely short 2tcc = 33 minute caustic
crossing of the planetary event OGLE-2015-BLG-0954.
This proved crucial to both the measurement of the Ein-
stein radius (θE = 1.7 mas) and to the arguments that
the lens must be in the near disk (from the high proper
motion µrel = 18 mas yr−1). Hence, it was crucial both
to the mass estimates of the host (0.37 ± 0.14 M⊙) and
planet (4.4 ± 1.6 Mjup), and to the recognition that the
lens and source will be separately resolvable in just a
few years.

While such short caustic crossings are relatively rare,
they are more likely to lead to complete mass and dis-
tance solutions than for typical events. This is because
the most likely reason for the short crossing time is very
high lens-source proper motion, which in turn is most
likely due to a very nearby lens. It is easy to measure
the ﬂux of such nearby lenses if they are of relatively
high mass. On the other hand if they are low mass,
their microlens parallax (Gould, 1992)

πE =

(16)

will be large and hence more easily measurable. Ei-
ther of these eﬀects can provide the second parameter
needed for a complete solution, provided that the Ein-
stein radius has been measured by resolving the caustic
crossing.

In the case of OGLE-2015-BLG-0954, we were able to
constrain the mass of the lens from the limit on lens
light. No parallax eﬀects were detected in the light
curve. Hence, we could not obtain a deﬁnitive measure-
ment. Instead we estimated the lens mass and distance

based on kinematic arguments from its high proper mo-
tion. These are consistent with independent arguments
derived from upper limits on lens light. They are also
consistent with a white dwarf host, although this would
be more surprising. The nature of the lens can be com-
pletely resolved in a few years based on high resolution
imaging.
