1. Introduction

In this paper, we consider an impulsive diﬀerential equation with continuous and

piecewise constant arguments of the form

x′ (t) + a (t) x (t) + b(t)x(t − τ ) + c(t)x([t − 1]) = 0, t 6= ti, t ≥ t0 > 0,

(1)

∆x (ti) = bix (ti) , i = 1, 2, ...,

(2)

where a ∈ C([0, ∞), R), b, c ∈ C([0, ∞), [0, ∞)), τ ∈ R+ is a ﬁxed constant, [.]

Since 1980’s diﬀerential equations with piecewise constant arguments have been at-

tracted great deal of attention of researchers in mathematical and some of the others

ﬁelds in science. Piecewise constant systems exist in a widely expanded areas such as

biomedicine, chemistry, mechanical engineering, physics, etc. These kind of equations

such as Eq.(1) are similar in structure to those found in certain sequential-continuous

models of disease dynamics [1].

In 1994, Dai and Sing [2] studied the oscillatory

motion of spring-mass systems with subject to piecewise constant forces of the form

f (x[t]) or f ([t]). Later, they improved an analytical and numerical method for solving

linear and nonlinear vibration problems and they showed that a function f ([N(t)]/N)

is a good approximation to the given continuous function f (t) if N is suﬃciently large

[3].

In 1984, Cooke and Wiener [4] studied oscillatory and periodic solutions of a linear

diﬀerential equation with piecewise constant argument and they note that such equa-

tions are comprehensively related to impulsive and diﬀerence equations. After this

work, oscillatory and periodic solutions of linear diﬀerential equations with piecewise

constant arguments have been dealt with by many authors [5, 6, 7] and the references

cited therein.

On the other hand, in 1994, the case of studying discontinuous solutions of diﬀer-

ential equations with piecewise continuous arguments has been proposed as an open

problem by Wiener [8]. Due to this open problem, some impulsive diﬀerential equa-

tions with piecewise constant arguments have been studied [9, 10, 11]. Moreover,

the monographs [12, 13] includes many results on the theory of diﬀerential equations

with piecewise constant arguments.

Now, our aim is to consider the Wiener’s open problem for the equation (1)-(2).

Moreover, as we know there is only one work on nonimpulsive delay diﬀerential equa-

tions with continuous and piecewise constant arguments [14].

In this respect, we

obtain suﬃcient conditions for the existence of oscillatory solutions of Eq. (1)-(2).

2

Deﬁnition 1 It is said that a function x deﬁned on the set {−1} ∪ [−τ, ∞) is a

solution of Eq. (1)-(2) if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(D1) x(t) is continuous on [−τ, ∞) with the possible exception of the points ti, i =

1, 2, ...

(D2) x(t) is right continuous and has left-hand limit at the points ti, i = 1, 2, ...

(D3) x(t) diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes (1) for any t ∈ R+, with the possible exception

of the points ti, i = 1, 2, ..., and [t] ∈ [0, ∞), where one-sided derivatives exist,

(D4) x(t) satisﬁes (2) at the points ti, i = 1, 2, ...

Deﬁnition 2. A function x (t) is called oscillatory if it is neither positive nor negative

for t ≥ T where T is suﬃciently large. Otherwise, the solution is called nonoscillatory.

Remark 1. In this paper we assume that −∞ < bi < 1 for all i = 1, 2, ... Otherwise,

from the impulse conditions (2) it is obtained that the solutions are already oscillatory.

Remark 2. We assume that b(t) 6≡ 0 or c(t) 6≡ 0. If b(t) ≡ 0 and c(t) ≡ 0, then

Eq. (1)-(2) reduces an ordinary diﬀerential equation with impulses. The results on

the oscillation of impulsive ordinary diﬀerential equations can be found in the survey

paper [15].

2. Main Results

In this paper we also consider following diﬀerential inequalities.

x′ (t) + a (t) x (t) + b(t)x(t − τ ) + c(t)x([t − 1]) ≤ 0, t 6= ti, t ≥ t0 > 0,

(3)

∆x (ti) = bix (ti) , i = 1, 2, ...,

3

and

x′ (t) + a (t) x (t) + b(t)x(t − τ ) + c(t)x([t − 1]) ≥ 0, t 6= ti, t ≥ t0 > 0,

(4)

∆x (ti) = bix (ti) , i = 1, 2, ...

The main tools for the proofs of our results are following diﬀerential equation and

inequalities.

y′ (t) + a (t) y (t) + B(t)y(t − τ ) + C(t)y([t − 1]) = 0, t ≥ t0 + max{τ, 2}

(5)

y′ (t) + a (t) y (t) + B(t)y(t − τ ) + C(t)y([t − 1]) ≤ 0, t ≥ t0 + max{τ, 2},

(6)

y′ (t) + a (t) y (t) + B(t)y(t − τ ) + C(t)y([t − 1]) ≥ 0, t ≥ t0 + max{τ, 2},

(7)

where

and

B(t) = Yt−τ <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)b(t), t ≥ t0 + max{τ, 2},

C(t) = Y[t−1]<tj ≤t

(1 − bj)c(t), t ≥ t0 + max{τ, 2}.

(8)

(9)

The following theorem is a generalization of Theorem 1 in [16] to impulsive delay

diﬀerential equations with continuous and piecewise constant arguments.

Theorem 1.

(i) Inequality (3) has no eventually positive solution if and only if

inequality (6) has no eventually positive solution.

(ii) Inequality (4) has no eventually negative solution if and only if inequality (7) has

no eventually negative solution.

(iii) All solutions of the equation (1)-(2) are oscillatory if and only if all solutions of

equation (5) are oscillatory.

Proof. We will prove (i) since the proofs of (ii) and (iii) are similar to proof

4

of (i). Let x(t) be an eventually positive solution of inequality (3) such that x(t) >

0, x(t−τ ) > 0, x([t−1]) > 0 for t > T ≥ t0 +max{τ, 2}, where T is suﬃciently large.

Set y(t) = QT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)x(t). Since 1 − bj > 0, it is clear that y(t) > 0, y(t − τ ) > 0,

and y([t − 1]) > 0 for t > T. Now, we will show that y(t) is a solution of inequality

(6). From (8), (9), and (3) we obtain that

y′ (t) + a (t) y (t) + B(t)y(t − τ ) + C(t)y([t − 1])

= YT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)x′(t) + a(t) YT <tj ≤t
(1 − bj)b(t) YT <tj ≤t−τ
(1 − bj)c(t) YT <tj ≤[t−1]

+ Yt−τ <tj ≤t
+ Y[t−1]<tj ≤t

(1 − bj)x(t)

(1 − bj)x(t − τ )

(1 − bj)x([t − 1])

≤ YT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj) [x′ (t) + a (t) x (t) + b(t)x(t − τ ) + c(t)x([t − 1])]

≤ 0.

So, y(t) is an eventually positive solution of inequality (6). On the other hand, from

(2), we have

and

y(t−

i ) = YT <tj ≤ti−1
= YT <tj ≤ti

(1 − bj)x(t−
i )

(1 − bj)x(ti)

= y(ti)

(1 − bj)x(t+
i )

(1 − bj)x(ti)

y(t+

i ) = YT <tj ≤ti
= YT <tj ≤ti

= y(ti).

5

So, y(t) is continuous at the impulse points.

Now, let y(t) be an eventually positive solution of inequality (6). Then y(t) > 0, y(t−

τ ) > 0, and y([t − 1]) > 0 for t > T. We will show that x(t) is an eventually positive

solution of inequality (3). From (8), (9), and (6) we obtain that

x′ (t) + a (t) x (t) + b(t)x(t − τ ) + c(t)x([t − 1])

= YT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)−1y′(t) + a(t) YT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)−1y(t)

+b(t) YT <tj ≤t−τ

(1 − bj)−1y(t − τ ) + c(t) YT <tj ≤[t−1]

(1 − bj)−1y([t − 1])

= YT <tj ≤t

(1 − bj)−1 [y′ (t) + a (t) y (t) + B(t)y(t − τ ) + C(t)y([t − 1])]

≤ 0.

Moreover,

x(t−

i ) = YT <tj ≤ti−1
= YT <tj ≤ti

(1 − bj)−1y(t−
i )

(1 − bj)−1(1 − bi)y(ti)

= (1 − bi)x(ti)

and

x(t+

i ) = YT <tj ≤ti

(1 − bj)−1y(t+

i ) = x(ti).

So, x(t) is an eventually positive solution of inequality (3). The proof is complete.

Following we give several suﬃcient conditions for the oscillation of equation (1)-(2).

Theorem 2.

If one of the following conditions is satisﬁed then every solution of

equation (1)-(2) is oscillatory:

where l = min{τ, 1}.

Proof. Let conditions (10) or (11) is satisﬁed. We shall prove that the existence

of eventually positive (or negative) solutions leads to a contradiction. Let x(t) be

an eventually positive solution of equation (1)-(2). Then y(t) = QT <tj ≤t

is an eventually positive solution of equation (5) such that y(t) > 0, y(t − τ ) >

(1 − bj)x(t)

0, y([t − 1]) > 0 for n + 1 > t ≥ n > T. Taking

n + 1 > t ≥ n > T, we get z(t) is nonincreasing for t > T.

Now, we consider two cases:

Case 1. τ > 1. Then it is clear that z(t − τ ) ≥ z(t − 1) and z([t − 1]) ≥ z(t − 1)

for t > T.

If x(t) is an eventually negative solution of equation (1)-(2), then −x(t) is an eventu-

ally positive solution of equation (1)-(2) and we obtain same contradiction. So, the

proof is complete.

(19)

Then every solution of Eq. (1)-(2) is oscillatory.

Remark 3. If b(t) 6= 0 and c(t) ≡ 0, then Eq. (1)-(2) reduces to a delay diﬀerential

equation with impulses. Condition (19) is similar to hypothesis of Theorem 1′ in [16].

The diﬀerence between the hypotheses occurs because of the right continuity of the

solution instead of left continuity.

More results on the oscillation of impulsive delay diﬀerential equations can be found

in the survey paper [17].

(20)

Then every solution of Eq. (1)-(2) is oscillatory.

Remark 4. If b(t) ≡ 0, c(t) 6= 0, then Eq. (1)-(2) reduces to an impulsive delay dif-

ferential equation with piecewise constant argument. Eq. (1)-(2) with b(t) ≡ 0, and

11

ti = i, i = 1, 2, ... has been investigated in [9]. So, Corollary 2 is a generalization of

Theorem 4 in [9].

Moreover, in [9], a diﬀerence equation is a main tool for the proofs. Similarly, in the

other works such as [4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 18, 19] the relation between diﬀerence equa-

tions and diﬀerential equations with piecewise constant arguments are underlined.

Here, because of the existence of continuous argument, we have diﬀuculty to obtain

related diﬀerence equation. So, we apply another technique which is worked for delay

diﬀerential equations.

Proof. Let conditions (21) or (22) is satisﬁed. We shall prove that the existence

of eventually positive (or negative) solutions leads to a contradiction. Let x(t) be

an eventually positive solution of equation (1)-(2). Then y(t) = QT <tj ≤t

is an eventually positive solution of equation (5) such that y(t) > 0, y(t − τ ) >

(1 − bj)x(t)

0, y([t − 1]) > 0 for n + 1 > t ≥ n > T. Using the same arguments in the proof

of Theorem 2, we obtained that z(t) deﬁned in (12) is nonincreasing for t > T. We

consider two cases:

Case 1. τ > 1. Dividing inequality (14) by z(t), and then integrating from t − 1

which contradicts with (27). So, lim inf

sketch of the proof. Dividing inequality (18) by z(t), and then integrating from t − τ

to t, it is obtained that

z(t − τ )

z(t)

≥ e

(29)

Using the similar arguments in Case 1, we get that lim inf

z(t − τ )

z(t)

is ﬁnite. So, from

inequality (29), we have

which contradicts (21).

Moreover, dividing inequality (18) by z(t), and then integrating from n + 1 − τ to

n + 1, it is obtained that

z(n + 1 − τ )

z(n + 1)

(30)

By using the similar arguments in Case 1, we get that lim inf

z(n + 1 − τ )

z(t)

is ﬁnite.

Then every solution of Eq. (1)-(2) is oscillatory.

Then every solution of Eq. (1)-(2) is oscillatory.

Now, we give some examples to illustrate our results. Note that previous results in

the litarature can not be applied following diﬀerential equations to obtain existence

of oscillatory solutions.

Example 1. Let us consider the following diﬀerential equation

x′(t) + πx(t −

2

) + c(t)x([t − 1]) = 0, t 6= n, n = 1, 2, ..., t > 0,

(31)

x(n+) − x(n−) = −x(n+), n = 1, 2, ...,




where c(t) ≥ 0 is any continuous function.

It can be shown that the hypotheses

of Theorem 2 as well as Theorem 3 are satisﬁed. So, all solutions of Eq. (31) are

oscillatory.

Example 2. Consider the following diﬀerential equation

x′(t) + x(t) + πx(t −

2

) + etx([t − 1]) = 0, t 6= tn, n = 1, 2, ..., t > 0,

(32)

x(t+

n ) − x(t−

n ) = −2nx(t+

n ), n = 1, 2, ...,




where {tn}∞

n=1 is an increasing sequence such that lim
n→∞

tn = ∞.

It is clear that a(t) = 1, b(t) = π, c(t) = et, τ =

5
2

and bn = −2n. It can be

shown that the hypotheses of Theorem 2 as well as Theorem 3 are satisﬁed. So, all

solutions of Eq. (32) are oscillatory.
