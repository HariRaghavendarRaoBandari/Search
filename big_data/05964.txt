Abstract

A peculiar radiation arising as a result of radiation interference of nonlinear
oscillators excited by a monochromatic plane wave ﬁeld of the incident particle
is described. The radiation properties are determined by the fact that a phase of
each oscillator radiation ﬁelds is synchronized by a wave ﬁeld, while the radiation
itself occurs due to the particle ﬁeld inﬂuence on the oscillators. The consideration
is performed for a thin ﬁlm with negligible density eﬀect. It is supposed that the
contribution is given only by a long-wave part of the Weizsacker spectrum for
which nonlinear polarization coeﬃcients of medium are large.

Keywords: non-linear oscillator radiation, Pockels eﬀect, spectral density of the

particle ﬁeld.

Introduction

In the classical work [1] it was noted that if the transition radiation occurs when a
charged particle passes through the medium with varying refraction coeﬃcient one may
talk of not only the transition radiation or the resonance transition radiation but call the
corresponding process a transition scattering. In fact, in that case a permittivity wave
(refraction coeﬃcient wave), which can be either standing or travelling, as if scatters
on the moving charge giving rise to an electromagnetic radiation. There will be no
reason to apply for these conditions a term transition scattering [2] instead of transition
radiation if the eﬀect is not preserved in the limiting case of stationary charge. Then
the discussion about the transition radiation is at any rate unnatural, whereas the term
‘transition scattering’ is the essence of the matter. In particular, this is in reference to,
e.g., incidence of permeability wave on the stationary (ﬁxed) charge, with e/m waves
diverging from the charge.

At present, public opinion [3] is in favor of the following determination of the
transition radiation ‘We call it the transition radiation, the part of multi-component

1

medium radiation that does not vanish in the limit of uniform source movement, and,
vice versa, vanishes in the limit of homogeneous (at any space and time scales) medium’.
This determination embraces both transition radiation on the speciﬁc boundary [4] and
other types, such as diﬀraction radiation [5], resonance radiation [6] and polarization
radiation [7], etc.

The techniques of theoretical description of the radiation for diﬀerent local dynam-
ical multi-component systems have much in common. However, taking into account
joint public opinion, in the present work we consider a dynamical system consisting
of the non-linear optical medium in which a monochromatic coherent e/m radiation
scatters on a local region produced by the charged particle. It is shown that in the
absence of density eﬀect there occurs a radiation which can be called electro-optical,
because the Pockels eﬀect is used. This phenomenon is practically non-inertial, with
speed capability of the order of 10−10 sec. Due to this fact, the electro-optical radiation
can be used for determination of the Lorentz-factor of charged particles in the large
range (presumably, more than 103), in particular, in experiments on the spacecraft
instruments.

2

In this work a peculiar radiation is found that is brought about as a result of
interference of non-linear ﬁlm oscillator radiation, when the oscillators are excited by a
monochromatic plane wave ﬁeld of the incident particle. The property of that radiation,
which we shall call an electro-optical radiation, is determined by the fact that the
pase of individual oscillator ﬁelds is synchronized by a wave ﬁeld, with the radiation
itself induced by the particle ﬁeld inﬂuence on the oscillators. It is supposed that the
contribution is given only by a long-wave part of the Weizsacker spectrum for which
nonlinear polarization coeﬃcients of medium are large.

Let the radiation with the wavelength λ be observed at the angle θ relative to the
direction ~e3 of intersection between plane of the wave incidence and the ﬁlm. Then
interference condition has the form

cos(θ) =

λ
d

,

(1)

where d = λκ/ cos(ψ), λκ – the wavelength of an external e/m ﬁeld, ψ is angle between
the wave propagation ~eκ and the polar axis ~e3.

This condition, in view of linear extent of the sources, holds also in some neigh-
borhood of generator of a cone with axis ~e3 and angular opening θ. Consequently, as
θ → 0 and λ → λκ/ cos(ψ) the radiation intensity grows. So, the electro-optical radia-
tion spectrum concentrates near λ = λκ/ cos(ψ) and, as will be shown below, its width
and intensity depend on energy of the incident particle.

In order to obtain the main formulas of the theory we shall use non-harmonic oscil-
L of the incident particle and

lator model, for which movement equation in the ﬁeld E(γ)
laser ﬁeld EL has the form

(2)

where XL is an oscillator displacement from the equilibrium position ~r, and ωf , Γf ,
ef and mf are frequency, attenuation, eﬀective charge and mass of an oscillator, re-
spectively; TLk(x) is the non-harmonic correction to frequency associated with strong
crystal ﬁelds in the ﬁlm.

In case of the quadratic nonlinearity, this correction is particularly large when one

of the ﬁelds is almost constant (analogous to the Pockels eﬀect).

In the case under consideration a long-wave part of the Weizsacker spectrum of the
particle is chosen as a slow ﬁeld. The oscillator displacement XL takes the form of a
sum of slow ρL and fast ξL components. Neglecting from now on the terms, quadratic in
ξL and ρL and corresponding to the radiation on the second and zeroth laser harmonics,
we take, instead of (2), the following equation for ξL

It is supposed, when evaluating the ﬁelds in the wave zone, that a distance to the
observation point is large in comparison with the radiating system, but, on account of
good convergence of the integrals over the space occupied by the ﬁlm, the size of the
last can be taken inﬁnite. The ordinary procedure of calculation gives for the photon

Here ~s is direction of the particle movement, ~r0 t0 are the coordinates of incident point

Taking into account Eqs. (13), (14) and (15) the integration of (12) is elementary,
but we do not give a general formula for a plate of arbitrary width ∆ because the
radiation intensity dependence being of interest to us, which is a function of energy
particle, is possible only for thin ﬁlms for which the density eﬀect is missing.

Let us assume further on that the following condition holds

and omit the terms corresponding to contributions of the high-frequency Fourier com-
ponents of the particle ﬁeld for which phenomenological constants εA have to be small

(20)

Everywhere ~e denotes a unit normal vector to the surface of the ﬁlm.
It is worth to mention some peculiarities of diﬀerential ﬂux of the emitted photons

(17).

If the ﬁlm is illuminated by more than one laser the ﬂux, and hence a full number of
photons, depends on the position and time moment of the particle incidence on the ﬁlm.
In principle, this makes it possible to evaluate the particle coordinates with accuracy
of the order of c/(ωκ − ωκ′) and record the charge passage through the ﬁlm with time
accuracy ∼ 1/(ωκ − ωκ′).
Second peculiarity of the electro-optical radiation is associated, as was already men-
tioned, with its dependence on the particle energy. We consider now the character of
that dependence using evaluation of one-laser wave photon spectrum as an example.
Let the radiation direction ~n be speciﬁed by polar angles {θ, ϕ} relative to the unit

vector system {~e1, ~e2, ~e3} as follows

~n = ~e3 cos θ + (~e cos ϕ + ~e2 sin ϕ) sin θ,

(21)

where ~e2 = ~e3 × ~e. Then the vector ~λ in accordance with (20) is determined by the
formula

where

~λ =

~s(q~e2 + sin θ sin ϕ~e3),

ωn1

cos ψ − cos θ,

(22)

(23)

ψ being the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the axis ~e3, i.e.,
cos ψ = ~e3~eκ.

On the assumption that the diﬀerence of frequencies ω − ωκ is of the order of lattice
vibration eigenfrequencies in a crystal, we use the connection between the tensor σLjk
and the linear electro-optical coeﬃcient rLjk (the Pockels eﬀect) which corresponds to
the case when arguments of the function εA(ω, ω′) coincide, i.e.,

rLjk = σLjkε−2(ω)εA(ω, ω)

(24)

in order to get the photon spectrum gauge provided that ImεA(ω1, ω) = 0 and the
absorbtion is zero.

Allowing for the fact that the product rLjkEj = RLk is dimensionless, we obtain

from (17) after integration over ϕ a spectrum of the form

What is more, only three ﬁrst terms are left in (30) and free of q. In fact, since the
integration (28) is performed for ﬁnite limits, denominator vanishing is needed for the
divergence, i.e., the following condition must be satisﬁed

z = qˆǫ 2 + 4[ǫ(1 − S2

where

(33)

and the expression under root sign is equal to a. This condition is valid if and only if
q → 0 together with S. It is possible that a 6= 0, i.e., the angle θ remains ﬁnite. That
means that the radiation frequency is ﬁxed by the condition (23) with q = 0, which
coincides with the interference condition (1).

In the domain ω < nκ

ωκ cos ψ radiation in the limit ǫ → 0 is independent of energy
because q 6= 0 on entire interval of the angles and all the integrals are limited. As a
matter of fact, the radiation in this domain is a background one because here we need
to allow for the interference with other radiations (Cherenkov and transition radiations,
nonlinear incoherent light scattering and so on).

Finally, in region of the frequencies asymptotically close to a base frequency of the

electro-optical radiation

a basic term in Eq. (31) gives the spectral density at this point of the form (25) with

The coeﬃcient ǫ−1/4 corresponds to the spectrum growth proportional to the energy

to the power 1/2.

Clariﬁcation of details of the spectrum near the the asymptotic peak (35) is un-
practical in this example because the form of basic line of the electro-optic radiation
essentially depends on physical conditions of the interference such as number of plane
waves, the ﬁlm conﬁguration, spectral density of the particle ﬁeld (for example, when
the external magnetic ﬁeld is applied this quantity is signiﬁcantly changed), nonlinear
corrections to the density eﬀect, resonance eﬀects and so on. Ascertaining the inﬂuence
of many of these conditions is beyond the scope of our simple model of inharmonic
oscillators.
