Abstract

A radiopure cadmium tungstate crystal scintillator, enriched in 106Cd to 66%, with
mass of 216 g (106CdWO4), was used to search for double beta decay processes in 106Cd in
coincidence with four ultra-low background high purity germanium detectors in a single
cryostat. New improved limits on the double beta processes in 106Cd have been set on the
level of 1020 − 1021 yr after 13085 h of data taking. In particular, the half-life limit on the
two neutrino electron capture with positron emission, T 2νεβ+
≥ 1.1 × 1021 yr, has reached
the region of theoretical predictions. With this half-life limit the eﬀective nuclear matrix
element for the 2νεβ+ decay is bounded as M 2νεβ+
≤ 1.1. The resonant neutrinoless
double electron captures to the 2718 keV, 2741 keV and 2748 keV excited states of 106Pd
are restricted at the level of T1/2 ≥ (8.5 × 1020 − 1.4 × 1021) yr.

INTRODUCTION

Experiments to search for neutrinoless double beta (0ν2β) decay are considered as a promising
way to study properties of neutrino and weak interactions, test the lepton number conservation
[1, 2, 3]. In addition, the process can be mediated by right-handed currents in weak interaction,
existence of massless (or very light) Nambu-Goldstone bosons (majorons), and many other
eﬀects beyond the Standard Model [1, 3, 4, 5].

Experimental eﬀorts are concentrated mainly on the double beta decay with emission of
two electrons (see reviews [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]). The results of the experiments to search
for double beta processes with decrease of nuclear charge: the capture of two electrons from
atomic shells (2ε), electron capture with positron emission (εβ +), and emission of two positrons
(2β +) are substantially more modest (we refer reader to the reviews [6, 7, 14] and references
11–27 in [15]). Even the allowed two neutrino mode of the double beta plus processes is not yet
detected unambiguously: there are only indications on two neutrino double electron capture
in 130Ba [16, 17] and 78Kr [18] with the half-lives on the order 1020 − 1021 yr. At the same
time a strong motivation to search for neutrinoless εβ + decay is related with the possibility
to reﬁne the mechanism of the 0ν2β − decay when observed: whether it appears due to the
Majorana mass of neutrino or due to the contribution of the right-handed admixtures in the
weak interaction [19]. In addition, experimental data on the two neutrino decay could be useful
to improve theoretical calculations of the decay probability.

The isotope 106Cd (energy of decay Q2β = 2775.39(10) keV [20], natural isotopic abundance
δ = 1.25(6)% [21]) is one of the most suitable nuclei to search for the double beta plus processes.
In addition the isotope 106Cd is favored to search for resonant 0ν2ε transitions to excited levels
of 106Pd when there is a coincidence between the released energy and the energy of an excited
state [15, 22]. The decay scheme of 106Cd is presented in Fig. 1.

The nuclide 106Cd is one of the most studied (see a detailed review of the previous investi-
gations in [15]). At present there are three experiments in progress aiming at search for double
beta decay of 106Cd. The TGV-2 experiment in the Modane underground laboratory in France
utilizes 32 planar HPGe detectors with 16 thin foils of enriched 106Cd (δ = 75%) installed be-
tween the detectors. Recently new enriched foils with a higher isotopic concentration of 106Cd
δ = 99.6% were installed. The sensitivity of the experiment is at the level of lim T1/2 ∼ 1020 yr
[24, 25, 26]. The main advantage of the TGV-2 experiment is a high sensitivity to the 2ν2K
decay of 106Cd with the theoretically shortest half-life of the three allowed channels.

The COBRA experiment uses an array of CdZnTe room temperature semiconductors ≈ 1
cm3 each at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. The sensitivity of the experiment
to the double beta processes in 106Cd is at the level of lim T1/2 ∼ 1018 yr [27].

The third experiment, also carried out at the Gran Sasso laboratory, utilizes a radiopure
cadmium tungstate crystal scintillator with mass 216 g produced from cadmium enriched in
106Cd to 66% (106CdWO4) [28]. At the ﬁrst stage of the experiment the sensitivity at the level
of lim T1/2 ∼ 1020 − 1021 yr was reached for diﬀerent channels of double beta decay of 106Cd
[15]. To increase the experimental sensitivity to the 2β processes with emission of γ quanta,
the 106CdWO4 scintillator was placed inside a low background HPGe detector with four Ge
crystals. Here we report the ﬁnal results of the experiment with the 106CdWO4 scintillation
detector operated in coincidence (anticoincidence) with the four crystals HPGe γ detector.
Preliminary results of the experiment were presented in conference proceedings [29, 30, 31, 32].

2 THE EXPERIMENT

The 106CdWO4 crystal scintillator was viewed through a lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystal light-
guide (⊘40 × 83 mm) by 3 inches low radioactive photomultiplier tube (PMT) Hamamatsu
R6233MOD (see Fig. 2). The PbWO4 crystal was developed from deeply puriﬁed [33] archae-
ological lead [34]. The detector was installed in an ultra-low background GeMulti HPGe γ
spectrometer of the STELLA (SubTErranean Low Level Assay) facility [35] at the Gran Sasso
underground laboratory of the INFN (Italy) at the depth of 3600 m of water equivalent. Four
HPGe detectors of the GeMulti set-up are mounted in one cryostat with a well in the centre.
The volumes of the HPGe detectors are approximately 225 cm3 each.

An event-by-event data acquisition system is based on two four-channel digital spectrometers
(DGF Pixie-4, XIA, LLC). One device (marked (1) in Fig. 2) is used to provide spectrometric
data for the HPGe detectors, while the second Pixie-4 (2) acts as a 14-bit waveform digitizer
to acquire signals from the 106CdWO4 detector at the rate of 18.8 MSPS over a time window
54.8 µs. The second Pixie-4 unit records also trigger signals from the home made unit SST-09,
which provides the triggers only if the signal amplitude in the 106CdWO4 detector exceeds ∼ 0.6
MeV to avoid acquisition of a large amount of data caused by the decays of 113Cdm (Qβ = 586
keV) present in the 106CdWO4 crystal [15, 36]. The signals from the timing outputs of the
HPGe detectors after summing are fed to the third input of the second Pixie-4 digitizer to
select coincidence between the 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors oﬀ-line.

The 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors were calibrated with 22Na, 60Co, 137Cs and 228Th γ
sources. The energy resolution of the 106CdWO4 detector can be described by the function:
FWHM = (21.7 × Eγ)1/2, where FWHM and Eγ are given in keV. The energy resolution of the
HPGe detectors during the experiment was FWHM ≈ 2 − 3 keV for the 1332 keV γ quanta of
60Co.

Energy spectrum and distribution of the start positions of the 106CdWO4 detector pulses
relatively to the HPGe signals accumulated with the 22Na γ source (see upper panel in Fig.
3) demonstrate presence of coincidences between the 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors under
the condition that the energy of events in the HPGe detectors is equal to 511 keV (energy of
annihilation γ quanta), while practically there is no coincidence in the data accumulated with
137Cs. As one can see in Fig. 3, the distributions simulated by the EGS4 code [37] are in
agreement with the experimental data obtained with 22Na, 137Cs and 228Th gamma sources. It
should be stressed that the energy threshold of the 106CdWO4 detector in the coincidence mode
(≈ 50 keV) is much lower than that in the anticoincidence mode since the data acquisition in
the coincidence mode is triggered by the signals in the HPGe detectors.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Data analysis

The mean-time pulse-shape discrimination method (see, e.g., [38]) was used to discriminate
γ(β) events from α events caused by internal contamination of the crystal by uranium and
thorium. The scatter plot of the mean time versus energy of the background events accumulated
over 571 h by the 106CdWO4 detector is depicted in Fig. 4. The eﬃciency of the pulse-shape
discrimination is worse than that in the previous experiment [15] due to the lower light collection
eﬃciency with the PbWO4 light-guide. Nevertheless, the distribution of the mean time for the
events with energies in the range 0.9 − 1.1 MeV (see Inset in Fig. 4) justiﬁes pulse-shape
discrimination between α particles and γ quanta (β particles). The mean time for γ quanta
was measured with the 228Th γ source in the energy range 0.5 − 2.6 MeV as MTγ = 9843.
The energy dependence of the mean time distribution sigma (σM T
γ =
3376/q0.1 × Eγ, where Eγ is energy of gamma quanta in keV. The pulse-shape discrimination
was also used to reject overlapped pulses (mainly caused by pileups of the 113Cdm β decay

) was determined as σM T

106CdWO4 crystal scintillator in the low-background set-up. The plus-minus two sigma interval
for mean time values corresponding to gamma quanta (beta particles) and one sigma interval
for alpha particles are depicted. Events with the mean time values greater than ≈ 1.1 × 104 can
be explained by the overlap of events (mainly of beta decays of 113Cdm in the crystal). Inset:
Distribution of the mean times in the energy interval 0.9 − 1.1 MeV demonstrates the ability
of pulse-shape discrimination between γ(β) and α events.

The energy spectra accumulated over 13085 h by the 106CdWO4 detector in anticoincidence
with the HPGe detectors, in coincidence with event(s) in at least one of the HPGe detectors with
energy E > 200 keV, E = 511 keV and E = 1160 keV are presented in Fig. 5. The events in
the anticoincidence spectrum were selected by using the following cuts: 1) there is no signal(s)
in the HPGe detectors, 2) the mean time (MT ) value of a scintillation pulse is within the
plus-minus two sigma interval around the central value: MTγ − 2σM T
γ < MT < MTγ + 2σM T
(the interval is shown in Fig. 4). The pulse-shape discrimination cut selects 95.5% of γ(β)
events. The spectrum of the 106CdWO4 detector in coincidence with the energy release in at
least one of the HPGe detectors of more than 200 keV was built with the help of the same
pulse-shape discrimination cut. The energy spectra of the 106CdWO4 detector in coincidence
with the signal(s) in the HPGe detectors with energy 511 keV (1160 keV) were built by using
the following cuts: 1) there is event(s) in at least one of the HPGe detectors with energy
E = 511 ± 3σ511 keV (E = 1160 ± 2.3σ1160 keV) where σ511 and σ1160 are the energy
resolutions of the HPGe detectors for the annihilation peak and for gamma quanta with energy
1160 keV, respectively; 2) the signals in the 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors coincide within
the plus-minus three sigma time interval (see Inset of Fig. 3, the time cut selects 99.7% of
the coinciding events); 3) the mean time value of a 106CdWO4 scintillation pulse is within the
±3σM T

interval. The pulse-shape discrimination cut selects 99.7% of the γ(β) events.

Figure 5: (Color online) Energy spectra of γ and β events accumulated over 13085 h by the
106CdWO4 detector in anticoincidence with the HPGe detectors (“AC”), in coincidence with
event(s) in at least one of the HPGe detectors with the energy E > 200 keV (“CC >200 keV”),
E = 511 ± 3σ511 keV (“CC 511 keV”), and E = 1160 ± 2.3σ1160 keV (“CC 1160 keV”).

The anticoincidence spectrum was ﬁtted in the energy interval 940 − 3980 keV (χ2/n.d.f.=
157/118 = 1.33, where n.d.f. is the number of degrees of freedom) by the model built from the
energy distributions simulated by EGS4 code [37]. The model includes radioactive contamina-
tion of the 106CdWO4 crystal scintillator [15, 36], external gamma quanta from the materials of
the set-up (40K, 232Th, 238U in the cryostat of the HPGe detector, PMT, PbWO4 light-guide,
26Al in the aluminium well of the cryostat), distribution of alpha particles (which passed the
pulse-shape discrimination cut to select beta and gamma events), cosmogenic 110Agm in the
106CdWO4 scintillator and two neutrino 2β − decay of 116Cd with the half-life T1/2 = 2.62 × 1019
yr [40] present in the 106CdWO4 crystal with the isotopic abundance δ = 1.5% [28]. The result
of the ﬁt and the main components of the background are shown in Fig. 6.

The energy spectrum accumulated by the HPGe detector is presented in Fig. 7 together
with the background data taken over 4102 h. The counting rate of the HPGe detector with
the 106CdWO4 detector inside exceeds slightly the background counting rate. Some excess (at
the level of 30% – 170% depending on the energy of γ quanta) is observed in the peaks of 214Bi
and 214Pb (daughters of 226Ra from the 238U family). We assume that the excess is due to the
radioactive contamination of the 106CdWO4 detector and due to the HPGe detector passive
shield modiﬁcation (some part of the passive shield was removed to install the 106CdWO4
detector). We have also observed gamma quanta with energy 1809 keV, which we ascribe to
cosmogenic 26Al in the aluminium well of the cryostat. Besides, there is a clear peak at the
energy 262.5(5) keV with the counting rate 0.381(4) counts/hour (the peak is shown in the
middle part of Fig. 7). We ascribe the peak to gamma quanta of the isomeric transition of
113Cdm with energy 263.7(3) keV [41].

ground are shown: the distributions of internal and external (”ext γ”) 40K, 232Th and 238U,
distribution of residual alpha particles (α), cosmogenic 110Agm in the 106CdWO4 scintillator
(with activity 0.3 mBq/kg) and 2ν2β − decay of 116Cd. The excluded distribution of the 0νεβ +
decay of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd with the half-life T1/2 = 1.5 × 1021 yr is shown too.

3.2 Limits on 2β processes in 106Cd

The response functions of the 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors to the 2β processes in 106Cd were
simulated with the help of the EGS4 code. The simulated energy distributions in the 106CdWO4
detector without coincidence and in coincidence with 511 keV γ quanta (in coincidence with
622 keV gamma quanta for the 2ν2ε and 2νεβ + decays to the 1134 keV excited level of 106Pd)
in the HPGe detector are presented in Fig. 8.

There are no peculiarities in the data accumulated with the 106CdWO4 and HPGe detectors
that could be ascribed to the 2β processes in 106Cd. Therefore only lower half-life limits can
be set by using the formula:

lim T1/2 = ln 2 · N · η · t/ lim S,

(1)

where N is the number of 106Cd nuclei in the 106CdWO4 crystal (N = 2.42 × 1023), η is the
detection eﬃciency, t is the time of measurements, and lim S is the number of events of the
eﬀect searched for, which can be excluded at a given conﬁdence level (CL). All the limits are
presented in this paper with 90% CL.

We have analyzed diﬀerent data to estimate limits on the 2β processes in 106Cd. For
instance, to derive the value of lim S for the 0νεβ + decay of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd,
the 106CdWO4 anticoincidence spectrum was ﬁtted by the model built from the components
of the background and the eﬀect searched for. The best ﬁt, achieved in the energy interval
1000 − 3200 keV, gives the area of the eﬀect S = 27 ± 49 counts, thus providing no evidence
for the eﬀect.
In accordance with the Feldman-Cousins procedure [42], this corresponds to

lim S = 107 counts. Taking into account the detection eﬃciency within the interval given by the
Monte Carlo simulation (69.3%) and the 95.5% eﬃciency of the pulse-shape discrimination to
select γ and β events, we got the half-life limit: T1/2 ≥ 1.5 × 1021 yr. The excluded distribution
of the 0νεβ + decay of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd is shown in Fig. 6. The limit is
lower than that obtained in the previous stage of the experiment [15] due to slightly higher
background in the high energy part and worse energy resolution of the 106CdWO4 detector.

The counting rate of the 106CdWO4 detector is substantially suppressed in coincidence
with the energy 511 keV in the HPGe detectors. The coincidence energy spectrum of the
106CdWO4 detector is presented in Fig. 9. There are only 115 events in the energy interval
0.05 − 4 MeV, while the simulated background model (built by using the parameters of the
anticoincidence spectrum ﬁt) contains 108 counts. We have estimated values of lim S for the 2β
processes in 106Cd in diﬀerent energy intervals. For instance, there are 62 counts in the energy
interval 250 − 1600 keV, while the background model contains 68 counts. According to [42],
one should take lim S = 8.8 counts. Taking into account the detection eﬃciency of the set-up
to the 2νεβ + decay (7.59%), the part of the energy spectrum in the energy interval (92.3%),
the selection eﬃciency of the pulse-shape discrimination, time and energy cuts used to build
the coincidence spectrum (98.4% in total), we have obtained the limit on the 2νεβ + decay:
T 2νεβ+
1/2 ≥ 2.0 × 1021 yr. However, this limit depends on the model of background which has
some uncertainty related with our limited knowledge of the radioactive impurities composition

and localization in the set-up.
In addition, in some energy intervals (as in the considered
above 250 − 1600 keV) the measured number of events is less than in the model of background.
The authors of work [42] suggest in such a situation to report the so called ”sensitivity” of
the experiment deﬁned as the average upper limit that would be obtained by an ensemble of
experiments with the expected background and no true signal. Following these suggestions we
took a more conservative, background model independent limit on the number of events of the
eﬀect searched for as lim S = 15.3 counts, which leads to the following half-life limit on the
2νεβ + decay of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd which we accept as a ﬁnal result:

T 2νεβ+
1/2 ≥ 1.1 × 1021 yr.

The excluded distribution of the 2νεβ + decay of 106Pd to the ground state of 106Pd is presented
in Fig. 9 together with the excluded spectra of the neutrinoless and two neutrino double
positron decay of 106Cd. The limits on the processes with positron(s) emission for transitions
to the ground and excited states of 106Pd were obtained in a similar way mainly by using the
coincidence of the 106CdWO4 detector with annihilation γ quanta in the HPGe detectors (the
limits are presented in Table 1). A rather high sensitivity was achieved for the εβ + and 2β +

13085 h. The excluded distributions of diﬀerent 2β processes in 106Cd are shown by diﬀerent
lines.

Further suppression of the background was achieved by selection of events in the 106CdWO4
detector in coincidence with the intense γ quanta in the HPGe counters expected in the double
electron capture in 106Cd to the excited levels of 106Pd. For instance, gamma quanta with
energy 616 keV expected in the 2ε decay of 106Cd to the excited level 1128 keV of 106Pd
can be detected by the HPGe counters with a detection eﬃciency 2.42% (2.34%) in the two
neutrino (neutrinoless) process. As one can see in Fig. 10, there are only 17 (23) counts
in the energy interval 50 − 700 keV (50 − 2500 keV). According to [42] one should take a
”sensitivity” estimation of lim S = 8.4(9.7) counts. The energy intervals contain 78.2% (86.2%)
of the simulated 2ν2ε (0ν2ε) spectra. Taking into account the eﬃciency of the pulse-shape
discrimination, the time and energy coincidence with the gamma quanta 616 keV (97.3% in
total), the following half-life limit on the 2ν2ε (0ν2ε) decay of 106Cd to the excited level 1128
keV of 106Pd can be obtained: T 2ν2ε
1/2 ≥ 5.1 × 1020 yr). The excluded
distributions of the 2ν2ε and 0ν2ε decays of 106Cd to the 1128 keV excited level of 106Pd are
presented in Fig. 10.

1/2 ≥ 5.5 × 1020 yr (T 0ν2ε

Most of the limits on the double electron capture in 106Cd to the excited levels of 106Pd were
obtained in a similar way (including the transitions to the levels of 106Pd with energies 2718
keV and 2748 keV where the resonant processes are possible). Typical detection eﬃciencies for
the 2ε processes in 106Cd to the excited levels of 106Pd are 1.17% − 4.13% depending on the
level and decay mode, while the number of counts varies from 83 to 0 depending on the energy
in the HPGe detectors chosen to build the coincidence spectra. For example, 83 coincidence
counts were obtained in the energy interval 50 − 2600 keV in CC with energy 512 keV in the
HPGe counters, while 0 events were detected in the energy interval 650 − 2000 keV in the
coincidence with the energy 1160 keV in the HPGe detectors (resonant 0ν2K capture to the

distributions of the 2ν2ε and 0ν2ε decay of 106Cd to the 1128 keV excited level of 106Pd with
detection of 616 keV γ quanta in the HPGe detectors are shown.

We have also used the data accumulated by the HPGe detectors to estimate limits on the 2β
processes in 106Cd. For instance, in neutrinoless 2ε capture we assume that the energy excess
is taken away by bremsstrahlung γ quanta with energy Eγ = Q2β − Eb1 − Eb2 − Eexc, where
Ebi is the binding energy of i-th captured electron on the atomic shell, and Eexc is the energy
of the populated (g.s. or excited) level of 106Pd. In case of transition to an excited level, in
addition to the initial γ quantum, other γ’s will be emitted in the nuclear deexcitation process.
For example, to derive a limit on the 0ν2K capture in 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd
the energy spectrum accumulated with the HPGe detectors was ﬁtted in the energy interval
2700 − 2754 keV by a simple function (ﬁrst degree polynomial function to describe background
plus Gaussian peak at the energy 2726.7 keV with the energy resolution FWHM = 4.4 keV
to describe the eﬀect searched for). The ﬁt gives an area of the peak 6.2 ± 3.2 counts, with no
evidence for the eﬀect. According to [42] we took 11.4 events which can be excluded with 90%
CL. Taking into account the detection eﬃciency for gamma quanta with energy 2726.7 keV
in the experimental conditions (1.89%) we have set the following limit for the 0ν2K capture
of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd: T1/2 ≥ 4.2 × 1020 yr. Limits on the 0νKL and 0ν2L
capture in 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd (T1/2 ≥ 1.3 × 1021 yr and T1/2 ≥ 5.4 × 1020 yr,
respectively) were derived in the similar way. The excluded peaks are shown in Fig. 11. We
would like to stress the certain advantages of isotope 106Cd for which the high accuracy Q2β
value is now available. Thanks to this feature one could distinguish clearly the 0ν2K, 0νKL
and 0ν2L modes of the decay using high resolution HPGe detectors.

All the half-life limits obtained in the present work are summarized in Table 1, where results

of the most sensitive previous experiments are given for comparison.

3.2.1 Limit on 106Cd 2νεβ + decay matrix element

An upper limit on the eﬀective nuclear matrix element for the 2νεβ + decay (M 2νεβ+
obtained with the help of the following formula:

ef f

) can be

lim M 2νεβ+

ef f = 1/rlim T 2νεβ+

where G2νεβ+ is the phase space factor for the 2νεβ + decay, M 2νεβ+
A(mec2)M 2νεβ+, gA is
the axial vector coupling constant, and mec2 is the electron mass. Using the recently calculated
phase space factors 702 × 10−24 yr−1 [43] and 741 × 10−24 yr−1 [44], we have obtained the
following limit on the nuclear matrix element for the 2νεβ + decay of 106Cd to the ground state
of 106Pd: M 2νεβ+

ef f = g2

ef f ≤ 1.1.

4 CONCLUSIONS

An experiment to search for 2β decay of 106Cd with enriched 106CdWO4 crystal scintillator in
coincidence with four crystals HPGe γ detector has been completed after 13085 h of data taking.
New limits on 2ε, εβ + and 2β + processes in 106Cd were set on the level of T1/2 > 1020 − 1021 yr.
The highest sensitivity was achieved mainly by analysis of coincidence between the 106CdWO4
and the HPGe detectors. For the decay channels with emission of positrons (εβ + and 2β +
decays) a higher sensitivity was achieved in coincidence with annihilation gamma quanta, while
coincidence of the 106CdWO4 detector with intensive gamma quanta in the HPGe counters gives
the most stringent limits on the double electron capture in 106Cd to excited levels of 106Pd.
The half-life limit on the two neutrino εβ + decay, T1/2 ≥ 1.1 × 1021 yr, reached the region of
some theoretical predictions [19, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. By using the half-life limit the nuclear
matrix element for the 2νεβ + decay of 106Cd to the ground state of 106Pd can be bounded as

incidence, CC in coincidence at the given energy with HPGe, HPGe using only the HPGe
detectors) is also reported. The results of the most sensitive previous experiments are given for
comparison.

channel of the decay due to the high activity of 113Cdm in the 106CdWO4 crystal scintillator.
Advancement of the experiment is in progress using the 106CdWO4 detector in coincidence with
two large volume CdWO4 scintillation detectors in close geometry to improve the detection
eﬃciency to gamma quanta emitted in the double beta processes in 106Cd.
