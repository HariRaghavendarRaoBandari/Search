Abstract

We investigate magnetic resonances driven in thermal vapour of alkali atoms by laser radiation

broadly modulated at a frequency resonant with the Zeeman splitting. A model accounting for both

hyperﬁne and Zeeman pumping is developed and its results are compared with experimental mea-

surements performed at relatively weak pump irradiance. The interplay between the two pumping

processes generates intriguing interaction conditions, often overlooked by simpliﬁed models.

INTRODUCTION

Optical pumping processes in atomic samples [1] have been subject of intensive theoretical

and experimental studies since the 60s [2], and have been used in several applications includ-

ing, laser cooling [3], molecular spectroscopy [4] and atomic magnetometry. Atomic mag-

netometers are nowadays available as commercial devices, but further research is presently

carried out to optimize the performance, as well as to better understand phenomena and

mechanisms which subtly act in this kind of apparatuses.

The interest in precise and sensitive magnetic ﬁeld measurements led to a revival of the

research in magnetometry, and particularly in the optical-atomic sensors. Optical magne-

tometers were recently subject to impressive advances in terms of sensitivity. The possibility

of absolute ﬁeld measurements, the low operation costs and power consumption, the robust-

ness, and the potential for miniaturization, let these devices compete with superconducting

quantum interference devices, traditionally regarded as state-of-the-art magnetometric sen-

sors.

The typical working principle of an atomic optical magnetometer [5] is based on the

preparation of an atomic state using optical pumping and on the detection of its time-

evolution driven by the magnetic ﬁeld under measurement. Some recent works on atomic

magnetometry have addressed time-domain operation techniques, where the atomic state

is ﬁrst prepared and then is followed in its free evolution within the decay time [6].

In

contrast, most of the approaches reported in the literature are based on a frequency-domain

detection [7].

In this case, a steady-state condition is reached, by means of a periodic

regeneration of the atomic state to be analyzed. This regeneration is obtained by applying

an appropriate optical radiation having some parameter periodically modulated in resonance

(or near-resonance) with the evolution of the atomic state. Experiments have been reported

where the modulated parameter of the pump radiation is its amplitude [8–10], its polarization

[11–14], or its optical frequency [15, 16]. Diﬀerent macroscopic quantities have been chosen

to be measured as well, such as the absorption [12], the polarization rotation [17–19], or

(in similar experiments based on solid-state samples) the ﬂuorescence [20], all opening an

indirect way to follow the vapour magnetization.

Optical pumping is often applied in regime of strong intensity where power broadening

and non linear dependence on the laser intensity occur. Studies in low intensity regime are

2

also reported [21].

Our study concerns a setup developed for precise atomic magnetometry, which here is

operated in a condition of weak excitation intensity. The atomic sample is illuminated by

two collinear laser beams. One of them (modulated beam, MB in the following) is frequency

modulated and circularly polarized, and the second one (detection beam, DB) is linearly

polarized with polarization plane rotated by the time dependent circular birefringence of

the sample. In other terms, the MB induces a magnetic dipole that precesses at the Larmor

frequency and the dipole component parallel to the beams is monitored.

The MB is broadly modulated in frequency, thus both the ground hyperﬁne states of the

atomic vapour are excited with non-vanishing rates. Such broad modulation gives rise to

an important interplay between hyperﬁne and Zeeman pumping that takes advantages in

optical magnetometry [22]. The proposed excitation scheme not only simpliﬁes the setup

(pump-repump scheme is often applied as an alternative), but has the potential of signiﬁ-

cantly increasing the signal without increasing the magnetic resonances width, particularly

at higher intensities, with obvious practical implications.

In this work we address mainly the aspects related to the wide MB frequency modulation,

restricting the investigation to a regime of relatively weak intensity, deferring the analysis of

the intense pumping to another study. We develop a model considering the MB interaction

with the whole level structure of the D1 Cs transitions: a point which is often overlooked in

the literature. We obtain a modiﬁed version of the Larmor equation for the magnetization

created in a given ground state Zeeman multiplet. An analytical expression for the magneti-

zation amplitude, pointing out the dependence on the MB modulation parameters, is found

and it matches very well with the experiment.

The paper is organized as follows:

in Section II we brieﬂy describe the experimental

apparatus; in Section III the theoretical model is reported; ﬁnally in Section IV we discuss

and compare the theoretical and the experimental results.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A detailed description of the experimental set-up is given in Refs.[18, 22]. Brieﬂy, Cs

vapour is contained in a sealed cell, where buﬀer gas is added to counteract time-of-ﬂight

line broadening of the magnetic resonances and to increase the optical pumping eﬀect. The

3

Cs Atoms are optically pumped by a circularly polarized, near resonant laser (MB) light

at 894 nm (D1 Cs line). The cell is at room temperature and in a highly homogeneous

magnetic ﬁeld. A balanced polarimeter enables the detection of the atomic precession,

which causes the polarization rotation of a linearly polarized beam (DB), near resonant

with the Fg = 4 to Fe = 3, 4, 5 group of transitions belonging to the Cs D2 line. The

set-up contains two channels (see Fig. 1), which in magnetometric applications [23–25] are

used to reject common-mode magnetic noise and to measure local magnetic variations by

means of a diﬀerential method. In the present work one of the channels keeps being used to

detect the atomic spins precession, while the other one (monitor, MNT) is used for precise

determination of the DB and MB intensities and absolute frequencies. The DB radiation is

attenuated down to 10 nano-Watt and kept at a constant frequency, blue detuned by about

2 GHz with respect to the D2 transition set starting from Fg = 4. The MB radiation, which

in magnetometric applications was in the milli-Watt range, here is attenuated down to 100

nano-Watt and its optical frequency is made time-dependent through a junction current

modulation at a frequency matching (or ranging around) the Larmor frequency. Both the

MB and DB have a circular beam spot about 1 cm2 in size.

The optical frequency of the MB is monitored by the MNT channel, where the light is

sent to a ﬁxed length Fabry-Perot interferometer and to a secondary Cs cell without buﬀer

gas. Both the absorption and the interferometric signals are detected by photo-detection

stages with a bandpass largely exceeding the MB modulation frequency. The two diagnostics

provide both a relative and an absolute measure of the instantaneous detuning of the MB

frequency. The (ﬁxed) DB optical frequency is monitored as well, and it is passively stabilized

within 100 MHz.

A sinusoidal signal modulates the optical frequency of the MB at the Larmor frequency,

and references a lock-in ampliﬁer detecting the polarization rotation of the DB. The Cs cell

is placed in a bias magnetic ﬁeld of about 600 nT resulting from the partial compensation

of the environmental ﬁeld. Such bias ﬁeld results in a Cs magnetic resonance centered at

about 2 kHz. The amplitude of the magnetic resonance is registered for various amplitudes

of the modulation signal and as a function of the mean MB optical frequency. To this aim

the MB optical frequency is slowly scanned by adding a ramp to its modulation signal.

III. MODEL

To develop a theoretical model that describes the time evolution of the monitored mag-

netization, we consider the whole level structure of the 133Cs D1 line. With reference to

5

Fig. 2, the free Hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation frame reads as

H0 = ∆g Πg4 + δ Πe4 + (δ − ∆e) Πe3,

(1)

where the projector Πg4 is deﬁned as PM |Fg = 4, MihFg = 4, M|. Similar expressions hold

for the other projectors.

e4,g4 = −Πe4 d · ǫ Πg4 E0, Wg4,e4 = −Πg4 d · ǫ

ization versor, E0 is the amplitude of the laser electric ﬁeld and d is the atomic dipole

moment.

We need all these blocks in our model, because the laser modulation can be very broad

and during the periodic frequency sweep both the ground states may be resonantly excited.

The density operator has a similar block-matrix form

The blocks are deﬁned in the manner described above. The diagonal blocks ρe4, ρe3, ρg4, and
ρg3 contain both the level populations and the Zeeman coherences. The blocks ρe4,e3 = ρ†
and ρg4,g3 = ρ†

g3,g4 represent the hyperﬁne coherences, while the remaining blocks represent

e3,e4

the optical coherences.

We assume that the hyperﬁne coherences can be neglected (secular approximation) and

with standard methods we write the Bloch equation:

˙ρ = −i[H0 + Hint, ρ] + LD ρ,

(4)

where the Liouvillian LD takes into account the eﬀects of relaxation processes like sponta-
neous emission and/or collisions.

As the magnetization is monitored by the DB tuned in the vicinity of the Fg = 4 →
Je = 3/2 transition, the signal is substantially given by the |Fg = 4i state. We assume
that the eﬀect of the DB is very weak and its contribution to the Hamiltonian can be

neglected. Hence the Bloch equation (4) contains only the MB interaction. To some extent,

this approximation is relaxed in the following (see Appendix A).

The model produces equations for both the magnetization (orientation) and the align-

The pumping rate P (t) is reported in the Appendix with full derivation details. Notice

that Eq. (6) is essentially equivalent to the Larmor equation with an additional forcing term,
being Mx ∝ (m1,1 − m1,−1), My ∝ i(m1,1 + m1,−1) and Mz ∝ m1,0.

The Larmor frequency is ωL = gF gµBB. In our experiment ωL is in the kHz range, while

the relaxation rates (longitudinal and transverse) are in Hz range, so in Eq. (6) we used a

single rate γ. The geometry considered in the model is sketched Fig. 3.

(13)

Eq. (13) has a clear physical meaning: at low laser power the response of the system

is factored out. The ﬁrst factor gives the usual resonant behaviour when the modulation

frequency Ω is swept over the magnetic resonance line. The second term R1 contains the

details of the laser frequency modulation and level structure of the D1 lines.

The optical frequency of the MB is sinusoidally modulated at the magnetic resonance
frequency, so that Ω ≃ ωL and the laser detuning δ from the D1 Fg = 3 −→ Fe = 4
transition (see also Fig. 2) is

δ(t) = δ0 + ∆ sin ωLt.

(14)

It follows that R1 is a function of both δ0 and ∆. Moreover it depends also on the width of

the D1 one-photon transition G = Γ/2 + Γc + ΓD, where 1/Γ is the radiative lifetime of the

excited D1 multiplet, Γc represents the broadening due to collisions and ΓD is the Doppler

broadening. Due to the presence of buﬀer gas, the excited D1 states get depolarized with an

additional rate Γ′

c, which we added as a phenomenological dependence in R1 in a normalized

form r = Γ′

c/Γ. Finally, to model the inﬂuence of the DB, a parameter α, describing a global

population imbalance of the two ground hyperﬁne states is also introduced.

Appendix A contains a full derivation and discussion about the explicit form of R1, as

well as a detailed deﬁnition of the parameter α.

IV. RESULTS

In this section we report experimental measurements obtained in diﬀerent regimes, and

compare them with the theoretical proﬁles.

Beside atomic constants, the model contains several parameters (δ0, ∆, r, and G) ﬁxed

by the experimental conditions, and only one quantity, α, which is a free parameter. In our
conditions Γ ≈ 5 MHz, and the broadening due to collisions is dominant, as Γc ≈ 500 MHz
at 90 Torr of He, and ΓD ≈ 200MHz, thus we use G = 0.5 GHz in almost all the simulations.
Concerning r, it is known since the Sixties [28, 29] that the collisions with the buﬀer gas

atoms are eﬀective in depolarizing the D2 excited states, while perturb weakly the D1

2P1/2

states. Moreover our theoretical results do not depend strongly on the value of r, and we

have assumed r = 0.5 in all the the simulations.

The only free parameter – α – is chosen to obtain the best correspondence between the
measured and the simulated signals. As shown below, a value of α ≈ 0.25 leads to a good
comparison, a clear indication that, in spite of its very low power, DB has a not negligible

inﬂuence.

As for the modulation amplitude ∆, it has to be compared to ∆g, and three regimes
can be identiﬁed: small, i.e. 2∆ ≪ ∆g, intermediate (2∆ ≈ ∆g) and large (2∆ ≫ ∆g)
modulation amplitude respectively. In the following we discuss these three regimes.

Figure 4 shows the signal obtained for ∆ = 0.5 GHz. As predicted by Eq.(A15), the four

D1 transitions give eight peaks in R1, separated in two groups around the positions of the
two hyperﬁne ground-states, corresponding to δ0/∆g ≈ 0 and δ0/∆g ≈ 1. These peaks are
well resolved in conditions of small collisional broadening as can be noticed in Fig. 4 (a).

Here the experimental signal is recorded with a lower buﬀer gas pressure giving a nominal
Γc ≈ 18 MHz, so to compare we used the value G = 200 MHz. Increasing the collisional
broadening up to 0.5 GHz, some peaks overlap as can be seen in the Fig. 4 (b).

In all the plots, we normalize to 1 the height of the leftmost peaks, both measured and

simulated. The value of α is chosen in such a way to reproduce rightmost peaks height

matching the experimental observation. With α = 0 the right peak results four times higher

than the ﬁrst one (see the green-dashed line in Fig. 4 (b)). A good accordance between the
measured and simulated resonance amplitudes is found for α ≈ 0.25.

It is remarkable that when the MB is mainly resonant with the Fg = 3 transitions

(Color online) Comparison of theoretical and experimental signals as a function of

δ0/∆g in a regime of small modulation. For both plots the following values have been used in the

model: 2∆ = 0.5 GHz, r = 0.5, α = 0.25, ∆e = 1.1 GHz and ∆g = 9.2 GHz. The plots show

magnetic resonances amplitudes as obtained with (a) low buﬀer gas pressure (2 Torr Ar) and (b)

high buﬀer gas pressure (90 Torr Ne). Correspondingly G = 200 MHz and G = 500 MHz are used

in the simulations. In the plot (b) we report for comparison also the model output obtained with

α = 0.

(e.g. δ0 ≈ −∆) the recorded signal has peak value comparable with the one obtained with
(δ0 ≈ ∆g), in spite of the fact that the measured quantity is the magnetization in the Fg = 4
ground state. At δ0 ≈ −∆, the MB causes a strong hyperﬁne pumping towards the Fg = 4
state. Thus, despite the fact that the laser is not in resonance with the Fg = 4 sublevels, a

12

high degree of Zeeman pumping is observed. Thus the leftmost peak appearing in the plot

corresponds to an interaction condition where the MB produces a high amplitude magnetic

resonance, while weakly perturbing the hyperﬁne ground state where the magnetization is

induced. This interaction regime has been successfully used (in a regime of stronger MB

intensity) for high sensitivity magnetometry [22].

As shown in Fig.5, the model reproduces with good accurateness the signal behavior also
in the intermediate regime where 2∆ ≈ ∆g. In this case, the MB may resonantly excite
either one or both the ground states simultaneously, which happens for δ0/∆g ≈ 1/2. A
good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is obtained keeping the

same values of the parameters. In this case the eight components merge into four peaks of

comparable height and nearly symmetric shape.

The results corresponding to the third regime, where 2∆ exceeds ∆g, are shown in Fig. 6.

Here, some technical limitations prevent the possibility to extend the scan at higher values

13

of δ0, so that a rightmost peak corresponding to Leg (see Eq. (A3d)) is not recorded. The
leftmost peak has a maximum at δ0 ≈ −∆, according to what is expected from Eq.(A3). The
peaks observed experimentally have an asymmetric shape more evident at large values of ∆,

this feature is well reproduced by the model. On the other hand, similarly to what appears in
Fig. 4 some discrepancies emerges more visibly at δ0 ≈ ∆g. There is experimental evidence
that the DB, in spite of its very weak intensity, is responsible for these minor deviations:

those discrepancies actually change with the intensity and the detuning of DB.

V. CONCLUSION

A model is developed to describe the behavior of magnetic resonances measured in Cesium

vapour in an experiment where a weak intensity laser radiation tuned to the D1 transitions

is broadly frequency modulated. Such modulation makes the laser-atom interaction occur

14

in a condition where both the hyperﬁne ground levels are excited. In the approximation

of weak intensity, a multipole expansion analysis enables an accurate evaluation of the

measured quantity that is the time dependent magnetization of atoms in the Fg = 4 state.

A comparison with the experiment is made in three regimes, where the modulation depth is

smaller, comparable or larger than the ground state hyperﬁne splitting, respectively. A good

correspondence is found, and the model reproduces satisfactorily the recorded features with

the requirement of tuning only one free parameter (α). This parameter is phenomenologically

introduced to account for an imbalance in the populations of the Fg = 3 and Fg = 4 states

that is induced by the detection radiation.

is diagonal and quenches the multipoles with k ≥ 1 (see below).

Analogous expressions are obtained for the other diagonal blocks of ρ. From Eq. (A2)

we can infer that the laser gives a Hamiltonian contribution (term with the commutator)

as well as a relaxation (term with the anti-commutator) to the dynamics of the excited and

ground states multiplets. In (A2) we have introduced the abbreviations

and Rs.e. represents the spontaneous emission contributions, whose explicit expressions in
term of irreducible components (see below) are reported by Dumont [31]. In addition, we

neglect the excited state dynamics due to the magnetic ﬁeld and added a phenomenological

relaxation constant γ in the ground state.

To proceed further we assume the low laser power limit and completely un-polarized

ground states

where η is a very small parameter quantifying the approximation. Here the factors 1/2 ± α
(−1/2 ≤ α ≤ 1/2) account, in a phenomenological way, for the pumping eﬀects of the DB.
When α = 0 the DB is an ideal probe laser not disturbing the ground state dynamics. A

positive value of α denotes an increase of the Fg = 3 global population and a decrease of the

Fg = 4 one. A negative value of α would describe the other way around. Introducing the

populations imbalance in such simpliﬁed way corresponds to neglect the Zeeman sublevels

structure of the ground states and the details of their interaction with the DB: in other
word α 6= 0 reproduces only a global population imbalance between the two hyperﬁne
ground states, while excluding any polarization eﬀect.

To proceed it is better to introduce the irreducible components [2, 26] of each density

of the expression, this is exactly the P (t) function used in Eq. (9). The time-dependence
arises from the laser modulation, i.e., in Eq. (A3) the substitution δ → δ0 + ∆ sin Ωt.
