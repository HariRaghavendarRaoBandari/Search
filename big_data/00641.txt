ABSTRACT

Recently, it has been found that oﬀ-centre carbon burning in a subset of intermediate-mass stars does not propagate all the way to
the center, resulting in a class of hybrid CONe cores. The implications of a signiﬁcant presence of carbon in the resulting massive
degenerate cores have not been thoroughly explored so far. Here, we consider the possibility that stars hosting these hybrid CONe
cores might belong to a close binary system and, eventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at
rates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical phase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white
dwarfs harboring hybrid cores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation (as may be expected in some
degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deﬂagration (that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid
cores are made of a central CO volume, of mass MCO, surrounded by an ONe shell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation,
a medium-sized CO-rich region, MCO (< 0.4 M⊙), results in the ejection of a small fraction of the mantle while leaving a massive
bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of the products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its inner regions,
unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and shrinking phase of the remnant. In contrast, and somehow paradoxically,
delayed detonations do not leave remnants but for the minimum MCO we have explored, MCO = 0.2 M⊙, and even in this case the
remnant is as small as 0.13 M⊙. The ejecta produced by these delayed detonations are characterized by slightly smaller masses of 56Ni
and substantially smaller kinetic energies than obtained for a delayed detonation of a “normal” CO white dwarf. The optical emission
expected from these explosions would hardly match the observational properties of typical Type Ia supernovae, although they make
interesting candidates for the subluminous class of SN2002cx-like or SNIax.

1. Introduction

Supernovae are the result of the explosive end-point to the evo-
lution of stars of a wide variety of masses. Most massive stars go
through successive phases of hydrostatic burning until they form
an iron core, at which point they cannot obtain more energy by
means of nuclear processes. Their fate can be either a collapse of
the whole structure to form a black hole, or a collapse of the cen-
tral region followed by ejection of the envelope. In the last case,
the diﬀusion of radiation through the ejected material allows it to
shine in what is known as a core-collapse supernova (for recent
reviews, see Woosley & Janka 2005; Janka et al. 2007, 2012;
Burrows 2013). In contrast, stars of smaller mass end as white
dwarfs (WD), essentially dead stars with a composition and mass
that is set during their earlier central burning stages, and AGB
phase and associated pulsations. WDs composed of carbon and
oxygen (CO) and belonging to a binary system may be reacti-
vated by accretion of matter from the companion star and, un-
der favorable conditions, can undergo a ﬁnal nuclear phase in
which they are partially burnt to Fe-group elements and explode.
The nucleosynthesis is rich in unstable isotopes, which decay
and feed the subsequent optical display known as thermonu-
clear, or Type Ia (SNIa), supernova (Parthasarathy et al. 2007;
Howell 2011; Parrent et al. 2014). The precise path to WD igni-
tion is not completely understood. In principle, two possibilities

are considered, either both components are WDs (the double de-
generate channel, DD), or only one of them is a WD (the single
degenerate channel, SD).

There exists an initial mass frontier between core-collapse
and white dwarf formation. This frontier is located in the re-
gion of intermediate-mass stars (IMS), whose mass lies in the
range ∼ 7 - 11 M⊙, with these limits strongly dependent on
progenitor metallicity and input model physics (Woosley et al.
2002; Eldridge & Tout 2004; Smartt 2009; Ibeling & Heger
2013; Doherty et al. 2015). Stars in this mass range go trough
a ﬁnal hydrostatic burning phase transmutating carbon into oxy-
gen and neon (ONe) (Nomoto 1984; Ritossa et al. 1999; Siess
2010). Unlike CO WDs, WDs made of ONe and belonging to
a binary system collapse, rather than explode, when they ac-
crete matter up to the Chandrasekhar-mass, for which reason
they are usually excluded from the set of putative progenitors
of SNIa (Miyaji et al. 1980; Nomoto 1984, 1987; Guti´errez et al.
1996, 2005). Furthermore, merging of two WDs made of CO in a
DD scenario may lead to non-explosive C-burning and mutation
of the composition into ONe, with the same result of collapse
to a neutron star rather than explosion (Saio & Nomoto 1998).
Current multidimensional simulations of the merging of WDs
nurture the hope of avoiding the collapse (e.g. Pakmor et al.
2010; Moll et al. 2014; Raskin et al. 2014). However, these re-
sults are preliminary due to the extremely diﬃcult numerical

problems posed by ignition in the outer shells of the star, usually
aﬀected by low spatial resolution in two or three dimensions.

In this context it

is interesting to recall that very eﬃ-
cient neutrino cooling at the innermost stellar regions causes
C-burning start oﬀ-centre – see Dominguez et al. (1993) and
Garcia-Berro & Iben (1994) –, except for the most massive cases
of the above mentioned range. Eventually C-burning extends fur-
ther in the core, but at a certain point the physical conditions re-
quired for the burning front to propagate are not met and the pro-
cess stops, leaving a CO central region with a few tenths of M⊙
surrounded by an ONe shell. Recent analysis (Denissenkov et al.
2013) has shown that such a stratiﬁed chemical structure of the
core might result due to the eﬀect of convective boundary mix-
ing, which is able to prevent the C-burning ﬂame from reach-
ing the central C-rich regions of the star. In fact, similar struc-
tures composed of a central C-rich region surrounded by an ONe
(i.e. C-poor) zone have been found using diﬀerent evolutionary
codes, such as MONSTAR (Doherty et al. 2010), or the code
used by Garcia-Berro & Iben (1994). The question is neverthe-
less far from being closed (see, e.g. Waldman & Barkat 2007),
and it is interesting to analyze the outcome of diﬀerent conﬁgu-
rations of such CONe cores.

The existence of hybrid CONe WD warrants a reevaluation
of the ﬁnal outcome of the evolution of IMS. The presence of
carbon at the center of the WD makes again feasible the ex-
plosion rather than collapse to a neutron star, and the query is
whether the explosion of such a carbon-rich core surrounded by
a large, carbon-depleted, ONe mantle would look similar to a
SNIa.

The width of the initial mass range of IMS that could end as
hybrid CONe WD is ∼ 0.1−0.2 M⊙ in standard calculations (e.g.
Doherty et al. 2010; Ventura & D’Antona 2011; Doherty et al.
2015), but can be as large as ∼ 0.4 − 1.0 M⊙, depending on
the strength of convective boundary mixing (Denissenkov et al.
2013) and uncertainties in C-burning rates (Chen et al. 2014).
We note that CONe cores are found over a large variety of metal-
licities (Doherty et al. 2015) and also for a range of helium-
enrichments (Shingles et al. 2015). In any case, a narrow mass
range would allow to explain at most a few percent of the ob-
served SNIa (Meng & Podsiadlowski 2014), small but important
to understand. In particular, it has been advocated that their ex-
plosion might match some class of peculiar SNIa (Chen et al.
2014; Meng & Podsiadlowski 2014), and that the narrow initial
mass range would favour the homogeneity of the observational
properties within that class.

Currently, there are identiﬁed three, more or less homo-
geneous, classes of sub-luminous thermonuclear supernovae:
the so-called SNIax, the .Ia, and the Ca-rich ones. The best
studied one is the SNIax group (Li et al. 2003; Foley et al.
2013; Stritzinger et al. 2015; White et al. 2015), characterized
by maximum-luminosity velocities 2 000 - 8 000 km s−1 slower
and luminosities 0.5 - 5 mag dimmer than normal SNIa, and
hot photospheres. They do follow a diﬀerent trend in the light
curve peak brightness-width plane, although not far from normal
SNIa. They have been tentatively identiﬁed with failed deﬂagra-
tions of massive WDs leaving a bound remnant. Up to now, no
Iax supernova has been found in an elliptical galaxy (but SN
2008ge exploded in an S0 galaxy), thus suggesting that their
progenitors belong to a young population; the galaxies host-
ing all known Iax supernovae have active regions of star for-
mation, except for the mentioned case of SN 2008ge. The mass
range for stars forming CONe cores is consistent with such en-
vironments of Iax supernovae. This possibility is further sup-
ported by the observed colors of the putative progenitors of SN

2

2008ha and SN 2012Z, consistent with those of evolved interme-
diate mass stars (McCully et al. 2014a; Foley et al. 2014). The
.Ia class (Kasliwal et al. 2010; Drout et al. 2013) name is sug-
gestive of a SNIa with all its relevant magnitudes scaled down
by an order of magnitude: they are characterized by a very fast
evolution of the light-curve, whose peak is about 3 mag dim-
mer than normal SNIa (i.e., they are about an order of magni-
tude less brilliant), and an ejected mass of 56Ni of order 0.02-
0.03 M⊙. Their characteristic velocity, however, is of the same
order as normal SNIa, which suggests that the ejecta mass is
small, about a tenth of a Chandrasekhar mass. Drout et al. (2013)
ﬁnd that the ejecta of SN2005ek, a .Ia candidate, are dominated
by oxygen, while Kasliwal et al. (2010) speculate that the pro-
genitor of SN2010X might be an ONeMg WD. Finally, the Ca-
rich class (Perets et al. 2010; Kasliwal et al. 2012; Valenti et al.
2014) is deﬁned by their unusually large content of calcium, that
can amount to as much as half of the ejecta mass. However, at
present, their thermonuclear origin has not been robustly estab-
lished.

Here, we are concerned with the outcome of the explosion of
hybrid WDs, how does their drastic chemical diﬀerentiation in-
ﬂuence the hydrodynamic behaviour of the explosion, and which
is the range of properties of their ejecta. We do not calculate the
optical outcomes of the explosions, but concentrate on identify-
ing the most interesting combinations of progenitor system and
explosion type. We start by considering the formation of a hybrid
CONe WD as a result of the evolution of the primary star in an
intermediate-mass close-binary system. Next, we succinctly ex-
plain the methods used in our study and the characteristics of the
initial models. After that, we provide the results of the simula-
tions of the explosions of hybrid CONe WDs, discuss the results
in context with the properties of the aforementioned subgroups
of peculiar SNIa, and conclude.

2. Formation of hybrid CONe WDs

The formation of a hybrid CONe degenerate core is a conse-
quence of incomplete core C-burning. We consider here two
classes of hybrid CONe WDs, characterized by quite diﬀer-
ent sizes and masses of the CO central region. The ﬁrst class,
that we will call here large hybrid-cores (LHC), is obtained
following standard evolutionary calculations of IMS within a
narrow mass-range (Doherty et al. 2010; Ventura & D’Antona
2011), and harbor a large CO central volume surrounded by a
thin ONe layer. They are the result of carbon burning starting
very far oﬀ–centre in IMS with core masses of ∼ 1.04−1.06 M⊙,
and switching-oﬀ before reaching the center due to cooling by
neutrinos at the core innermost region. In the cases that con-
cern us, i.e. the lightest objects able to ignite carbon, suit-
able conditions for carbon-burning are not recovered after the
ﬁrst oﬀ-center burning episode (for instance Ritossa et al. 1999;
Gil-Pons & Garc´ıa-Berro 2001; Siess 2006; Doherty et al. 2010,
and references therein).

is the result of

The second class, that we will call medium-sized hybrid-
cores (MSHC),
IMS evolution when ei-
ther modiﬁed recipes for the strenght of convective bound-
ary mixing or uncertainties in the C-burning rates are allowed
(Denissenkov et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014). The mass of their
carbon-rich central volumes is MCO ∼ 0.2−0.45 M⊙, surrounded
by an ONe layer thicker than that in the LHC class. In this
class, the quench of the C-burning ﬂame is a result of the decou-
pling between the fuel –12C– proﬁle and the thermal proﬁle, due
to eﬃcient convective boundary mixing (see Denissenkov et al.
2013). As the ﬂame advances inwards, the carbon abundance

E. Bravo et al.: Hybrid CONe cores explosion

it faces decreases steadily due to the convective mixing of fuel
with ashes until, ﬁnally, it is so small that carbon ignition is no
longer possible, and a carbon-rich central volume remains un-
burnt (for a recent critical reevaluation of the role of convective
overshooting see Farmer et al. 2015).

It is interesting to note that in all cases there remains a small
residual abundance of 12C in the ONe region, a feature that is in
fact common to all Super-AGB star cores.

The scenario that would allow this model become a ther-
monuclear supernova involves its belonging to a close binary,
whose orbital parameters must meet two requirements. First, the
initial orbital period must be such that Roche lobe overﬂow from
the primary, and therefore a mass transfer episode, will not oc-
cur until it has become a giant hosting a deep convective en-
velope. Second, the initial mass ratio of the two components,
q = M1/M2 must be relatively low, say below 1.5 − 2, so that
merger episodes can be avoided. Both conditions determine ini-
tial orbital distances of a few hundred solar radii and secondary
masses M2 above ≈ 3 − 4 M⊙. Such systems start interacting
once the primary component reaches red giant dimensions, and
go through a ﬁrst common envelope (CE) episode, after which
the primary is a He-burning core and the secondary remains as
a main sequence star. A second giant (Super-AGB) phase of the
primary leads to a new mass transfer episode, also accompanied
by the occurrence of a CE, after which the primary becomes an
almost bare hybrid CONe degenerate core and the secondary still
is a main sequence star. The size of the carbon-rich region within
the hybrid CONe core depends on the location of the carbon
ﬂame at the onset of the second mass transfer episode, besides
other evolutionary ingredients mentioned above.

Depending on the details of the evolution of orbital parame-
ters, which are beyond the scope of this work, diﬀerent options
ensue at this point. If the orbital shrinkage has been signiﬁcant,
gravitational wave radiation might induce further shrinkage and
allow Roche-lobe overﬂow of the secondary component while
it is still a main sequence star. Otherwise, reverse mass transfer
can occur when the secondary reaches a subgiant or giant phase.
In either case, if the ﬁnal outcome is to be a thermonuclear su-
pernova, instead of a nova, mass accretion rates onto the white
dwarf must be above 10−7 M⊙/yr (Nomoto et al. 2007).

the
one-dimensional code described in Bravo & Mart´ınez-Pinedo
(2012), upgraded to include a more accurate treatment of the
coupling between hydrodynamics and nuclear reactions (Bravo
et al., in preparation). The hydrocode implements a nuclear net-
work of up to 722 nuclides, from free neutrons to 101In (see
Table I in Bravo & Mart´ınez-Pinedo 2012). The nuclear network
is solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations and it
is adaptive, i.e. its size and membership are decided at each time

1 The explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass WD can be representative
of the SD as well as the DD channel. In the ﬁrst case, a hybrid-core WD
accrets matter from a non-degenerate companion until carbon fusion
runs away at or near the center. In the DD case, there are several possi-
bilities, one of them being the merging of both WDs and the disruption
of the less massive to form a corona or accretion disk around the most
massive one. Later, this structure is accreted by the primary at a pace
slow enough that there is no ignition of carbon in its outer regions. In
this situation, the evolution of the accreting WD ends in a similar form
as described for the SD scenario.

step and at each mass shell according to a set of rules depending
on the abundances and reaction rates.

The initial model fed to the hydrodynamics code was a WD
with central density 2.6 × 109 g cm−3 and total mass MWD =
1.37 M⊙, in hydrostatic equilibrium. Two ﬂavors of the explo-
sion of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs were explored, either a direct
detonation (DETO) starting at the center of the star, or a delayed-
detonation (DDT) that starts at the center as a subsonic ﬂame,
propagates at a small fraction of the sound velocity (3% in our
models), and later makes a transition to a detonation at a pre-
scribed density, ρDDT. The thermal structure of the WD was dif-
ferent for both explosion mechanisms. In the DDT models, we
started from an isothermal WD at T = 107 K. On the other hand,
the initial WD was adiabatic in the DETO models, with a central
temperature of Tc = 109 K. Further details of the implementa-
tion of the explosion mechanisms in the hydrocode can be found
in the Appendix of Badenes et al. (2003).

In a recent work, Kromer et al. (2015) perform a three-
dimensional simulation of a pure deﬂagration of the carbon-rich
core of a hybrid CONe WD, assuming that the ﬂame cannot
propagate into the ONe mantle. The present models complement
theirs with respect to the explosion mechanism. We compare re-
sults in section 4.3.4.

The chemical composition of the WD and its imprint on the
explosion outcome is the main point of interest of this work.
To have a realistic basis on which to explore diﬀerent combi-
nations of hybrid core masses, mantle masses, and mass frac-
tion of the main species, we have followed the hydrostatic evo-
lution of an IMS star with the aid of MONSTAR (see e.g.
Frost & Lattanzio 1996; Campbell & Lattanzio 2008, and refer-
ences therein) in the version described in Gil-Pons et al. (2013).

2 and solar metallicity,
The star had a ZAMS mass 8.25 M⊙
Z = 0.02 (Grevesse & Noels 1993), and we followed its evo-
lution up to the ﬁrst few thermal pulses during its AGB phase.
In ﬁg. 1 (top panel), we show the composition proﬁles at the end
of our hydrostatic calculation. The degenerate core has a mass of
∼ 1.04 M⊙, with a structured chemical proﬁle made of a carbon-
rich, X(12C) ≈ 0.315, central volume with MCO ∼ 0.74 M⊙, a
thin C-burning front, and a neon-rich mantle. The transition be-
tween the carbon-rich central volume and the carbon-poor man-
tle is abrupt, a property shared with the hybrid-cores obtained
by Denissenkov et al. (2013). In the outermost regions of this
core there can be identiﬁed thin helium and hydrogen burning
fronts. The whole structure is surrounded by a massive but ten-
uous hydrogen-rich envelope. In a binary scenario, relevant for
the case we are considering in this work, a ﬁrst mass-loss episode
will cause the loss of most of the H-rich envelope, and the sec-
ond mass-loss episode will remove most of the He-rich rem-
nant envelope. As shown in Gil-Pons et al. (2003), the He and
C-burning processes and the resulting core compositions are not
altered by such mass-transfer, except that the expected progen-
itor mass would correspond to 0.5 M⊙ more massive models.
Therefore for the present work we can simply use single star
evolution models.

In table 1 we summarize the studied cases. For the MSHC,
we have considered carbon-rich regions of masses, MCO = 0.2,
0.3, and 0.4 M⊙ (models 1–19), while for the LHC we have
chosen MCO = 0.6, and 0.74 M⊙ (models 20–23). In all cases,
the carbon-rich region is composed of carbon, oxygen and neon,
with mass fractions similar to the carbon-rich region in the hy-
drostatic model shown in ﬁg. 1, i.e. X(12C) = 0.315, X(16O) =
0.678, and X(20Ne) = 0.007, and surrounded by a carbon-
depleted mantle.

LHC models 22 and 23 mapped precisely the chemical struc-
ture shown in ﬁg. 1 up to 1.0 M⊙, to avoid the H and He burning
regions, and then added mass-shells up to MWD with the same
chemical composition as in the shell at Lagrangian mass 1.0 M⊙
(middle panel in Fig. 1).

In all the other cases (models 1-21) the chemical structure
of the mantle has been simpliﬁed as follows. By default, and
with the aim of introducing in the explosion models as few free
parameters as possible, we assume a homogeneous mantle com-
posed of oxygen and neon up to MWD (for an example, see the
bottom panel in Fig. 1). We have adopted diﬀerent prescriptions
for the abundance of oxygen in the mantle, in order to check
its impact on the results. In most models, we have assumed a
mass fraction of 20Ne in the mantle equal to the maximum one
found in ﬁg. 1 (top panel), Xout(20Ne) = 0.63, which belongs
to a mass coordinate of ∼ 0.74 M⊙, and the corresponding 16O
mass fraction, Xout(16O) = 0.37. Since this choice is somewhat
arbitrary, we have also explored models with diﬀerent composi-
tion of the mantle, more reactive than in the default case, either
by adding a few percent 12C (models 2 and 8), or by increasing
Xout(16O) at the expense of Xout(20Ne) (see column ﬁve in table 1,
and section 4.3.1). Finally, we have explored the presence of a
mantle formed by two layers, an inner one with the default com-
position mentioned above, and an external one rich in carbon,
Xext(12C) = 0.32,with a mass Mext (column six). In section 4.3.2
we show that the precise structure of the mantle has no impact
on the outcome of the explosion of these models.

The initial models described above assume that the chemical
diﬀerentiation established during the He-burning and quenched
C-burning Super-AGB phase is maintained up to the supernova
explosion in the form of a hybrid-core. However, in the last
stages of evolution prior to thermal runaway of a Chandrasekhar-
mass WD, the energy released by the incipient carbon fusion
reactions is enough to drive convection (Piro & Bildsten 2008;
Piro & Chang 2008)3. The convective core that develops is usu-
ally thought to encompass most of the WD, which in our case
would destroy the chemically diﬀerentiated structure of the hy-
brid core. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties about the fea-
sibility of such a huge convective core. First, in general, the
eventual activation of URCA pairs might limit the reach of
convective motions (Stein & Wheeler 2006; Podsiadlowski et al.
2008; Denissenkov et al. 2015) and preserve the original chemi-
cal structure. Second, speciﬁc to hybrid-core WDs, the presence
of an abrupt separation between the carbon-rich central volume
and the carbon-depleted mantle might allow for the operation
of a self-regulating mechanism restricting the extent of convec-
tion. Convection during carbon simmering is regulated by the
release of nuclear energy near the center of the WD. When con-
vection reaches the ONe mantle and mixes it with the material
in the core, the carbon mass fraction in the center is expected
to decrease (besides the eﬀect of carbon consumption by nu-
clear reactions). As a result, the nuclear energy generation rate
may decrease, which would aﬀect the reach of convective mo-
tions. Through this mechanism, the carbon-depleted mantle may
provide a natural frontier for the convective core, avoiding full
mixing with the carbon-rich central volume. However, a proper
determination of the extent of such eﬀect, even if it is relevant
at all, would require following the evolution of the hybrid WD
during the carbon simmering phase, which is beyond our scope.
In view of the above uncertainties, full mixing of the WD
prior to explosion cannot be discarded. To explore its conse-
quences, we have calculated additional models of the explosion
of homogeneous WDs representative of the full mixing of some
of the hybrid-core WDs discussed before. (models 24–28 in ta-
ble 1). We address these homogeneous models in section 4.3.3.
Finally, models 29–32 are reference delayed-detonation
models with varying ρDDT, in which the initial WD had a ho-
mogeneous composition, i.e. without a diﬀerentiated core, of
X(12C) = X(16O) ≃ 0.5, with traces of heavier species with solar
metallicity ratios. These models, that do not come from hybrid-
core WDs, are identiﬁed in Table 1 with MCO = 1.37 M⊙. This
kind of models have been successfully compared to Type Ia su-
pernovae and remnants in the past.

4. Results

The results of our supernova simulations are shown in table 1
and in ﬁg. 2. We start by discussing the results of the simulations
of our default conﬁguration, i.e. homogeneous mantle depleted
of carbon and with oxygen abundance Xout(16O) = 0.37. The de-
pendence on several parameters of the initial model is discussed
later.

2 Due to diﬀerent convective boundary approaches used during the
core He burning phase of evolution, we ﬁnd hybrid CONe cores at initial
masses ∼ 1.5 M⊙ greater than those found in Denissenkov et al. (2013).

3 Another mechanism of chemical mixing would be gravitational set-
tling, whose eﬃciency would depend on the time elapsed since the for-
mation of the hybrid-core WD and the supernova event.

4.1. Explosionoflarge-hybrid-core(LHC)

Chandrasekhar-massWDs

The outcome of the explosion of LHC models with MCO of 0.6
and 0.74 M⊙ is quite similar, the main diﬀerence deriving from
the lower nuclear binding energy of the composition of the WD
with the smaller MCO. These explosions completely disrupt the
WD leaving no bound remnant. Both DETO models (20 and 22)
incinerate almost the whole WD and eject a huge mass of 56Ni,
but almost no intermediate-mass elements (IME). Since the clear
detection of IME at maximum light is one of the deﬁning proper-
ties of SNIa, these pure detonation models cannot match obser-
vations, just as with the detonation of homogeneous CO WDs.

On the other hand, DDT models (21 and 23) produce
amounts of 56Ni and IME in agreement with the predictions
of normal SNIa models, but the kinetic energy of the ejecta
is, respectively, 0.82 and 1.09 foes, substantially smaller than
those attributed to typical SNIa for their M(56Ni) (see, e.g.,

Mazzali et al. 2007; Woosley et al. 2007, and ﬁg. 2). In both
DDT models, there is ejected a small mass of unburned 16O,
0.14 M⊙, while the mass of 12C is negligible. The similarity of
the results of MCO = 0.6 and 0.74 M⊙ shows that the com-
position of the mantle is not a relevant factor determining the
outcome of the explosion of LHC models.

4.2. Explosionofmedium-sizedhybrid-core(MSHC)

Chandrasekhar-massWDs

The result of the explosion of WDs with MCO in the range
0.2−0.4 M⊙, requires more explanation. Pure detonation models
1, 7, and 15, are characterized by a small release of nuclear bind-
ing energy. In all of them, the detonation consumes the whole
carbon-rich region, but is unable to propagate into the mantle
due to the reduced ﬂammability of oxygen as compared to car-
bon. However, the result of the explosion depends sensitively

5

1051 erg, and small 56Ni mass. These results are quite like the
ones obtained for the pure detonation of the MCO = 0.4 M⊙
case, and do not depend signiﬁcantly on the value of ρDDT.

The result of the delayed-detonation changes dramatically
for MCO > 0.2 M⊙. Models 10–14 and 19 are similar to the
DDT models of LHC, i.e. the WD is completely disrupted and
the amount of 56Ni ejected is within that expected for normal
SNIa, while the kinetic energy is relatively small. There is a
monotonic increase of both the mass of 56Ni and the kinetic en-
ergy as a function of MCO, for a given ρDDT. For instance, at
ρDDT = 1.4 × 107 g cm−3, the range of 56Ni masses covered by
DDT models of both LHC and MSHC leaving no bound rem-
nant is 0.44–0.59 M⊙, and the range of kinetic energies 0.73–
1.09 foes. Allowing for diﬀerent DDT transition densities, the
amount of 56Ni synthesized monotonically increases with ρDDT,
similar to that found for the reference models 29–32, but the ki-
netic energy remains much smaller than in the latter.

It is remarkable that, in all the MSHC models just discussed,
the most violent burning mode, the pure detonation, leads to ex-
plosions less energetic than the delayed-detonation. This appar-
ent paradox can be understood as resulting from pure detona-
tions entering the ONe mantle at high densities, combined with
a monotonically decreasing nuclear energy release in detona-
tions as a function of fuel density. Since pure detonations do not
allow for any hydrodynamic response of the surrounding mat-
ter, the densities at which they arrive at the ONe mantle are the
same as in the initial structure at carbon runaway, that is above
109 g cm−3 for MCO = 0.2 − 0.4 M⊙. Figure 3 shows the ratio
of the nuclear energy released in a Chapman-Jouguet detonation
to the increase in speciﬁc internal energy of the fuel within the
shock front (just before nuclear reactions commence), as a func-
tion of fuel density. At fuel densities below ∼ 108 g cm−3, with
little dependence on the precise composition of the fuel, the en-
ergy released within the reaction layer of a detonation is enough
to drive the fuel to the shocked state, where it starts burning and
releasing energy that allows more fuel to detonate (Khokhlov
1988). In these conditions, the detonation can self-sustain once
it has been initiated. In contrast, at higher densities, the ﬁnal state
of the detonation ashes is so hot that a substantial fraction of the
produced iron-group elements (IGE) photodisintegrate and the
ﬁnal products are a mixture of IGE, IME, and light elements,
with the corresponding reduction in the nuclear energy yield.
The nuclear energy invested in the creation of IME and light el-
ements is restored later, due to their recombination when matter
expands and density decreases by about one order of magnitude
or more, but this cannot occur while the detonation is alive be-
cause of its supersonic nature. Thus, the nuclear energy released
at large densities is insuﬃcient to shock the fuel to the desired
state, and a piston would be needed4, or another source of energy
external to the detonation itself, to sustain the burning wave. As
a result, the pure detonation dies shortly after entering the ONe
mantle.

In the DDT models, burning propagation is initially sub-
sonic, as a deﬂagration, leaving time for matter to expand before
arriving to the ONe mantle. The densities at which the detonation
front arrives to the mantle, e.g. in models 12 and 19, are of order
107 g cm−3, low enough to allow self-sustainability of the burn-
ing front. The exception are the models with MCO = 0.2 M⊙,
e.g. model 5, in which the ﬂame reaches the mantle before the

4 Usually, such a piston-like eﬀect is provided in pure detonation
models by the supersonic burning of a region close to the center of
the WD, as a result of a shallow thermal gradient, which gives a phase
velocity of the combustion front above the sound speed.

WDs in the K-M(56Ni) plane, in context with standard SNIa
models. Empty circles stand for pure detonations of hybrid
WDs, while solid circles are for delayed detonations of the
same objects. Empty triangles belong to delayed detonations
of homogeneous CO WDs with varying ρDDT, which can ac-
count for normal SNIa (models 29–32 in Table 1). DETO mod-
els 15, 17, and 18 cannot be distinguished because their lo-
cation coincides with that of DDT model 6. Crosses belong
to the models of Ohlmann et al. (2014), while the dashed line
shows the approximate location of the normal SNIa models
according to Mazzali et al. (2007) (from .08 M⊙ of 56Ni for
the faint SN1991bg to .94 M⊙ for the bright SN1994ae) and
Woosley et al. (2007) (who provide a range of kinetic energies).
The four regions labelled with letters group models with more or
less homogeneous characteristics (see text for further details).

on MCO, because we are considering masses close to the min-
imum incinerated mass necessary to unbind a Chandrasekhar-
mass WD. The MCO = 0.2 M⊙ case releases too low nuclear
energy and the explosion leaves a large remnant of 1.30 M⊙,
i.e. only 0.07 M⊙ are ejected composed of oxygen and neon.
The outcome of the detonation of the MCO = 0.3 M⊙ model is
similar, with the only diﬀerence that the ejected mass is larger,
0.37 M⊙, still composed exclusively of oxygen and neon. No
signiﬁcant optical display, similar to any ﬂavour of supernova, is
expected from such objects. Nevertheless, the bound structures
would be inﬂated and hot for some time, which would make
them brighter than inert WDs of the same mass and potentially
detectable at not too large distances.

The pure detonation model with MCO = 0.4 M⊙ is energetic
enough to unbind the whole WD, even though just a very small
fraction of the mantle is burnt. The ﬁnal kinetic energy, 0.09
foes, as well the ejected mass of 56Ni, 0.10 M⊙, are quite small.
The result of the DDT models varies qualitatively as a func-
tion of MCO but, in all cases studied, more mass is burnt than in
the corresponding DETO models. For MCO = 0.2 M⊙ (models
4 and 5), there remains a small bound remnant of ∼ 0.1 M⊙,
while the ejecta has a small kinetic energy, a few hundredths of

6

E. Bravo et al.: Hybrid CONe cores explosion

of 0.37 M⊙. As the ejecta is in any case devoid of radioactive
isotopes, this change is not expected to have any observational
consequences.

4.3.2. Structure of the accreted mantle

More complex structures of the mantle have been explored in
models 3, 6, 17, and 18, which have a thick carbon-rich layer
surrounding the ONe shell. The results, which have to be com-
pared to models 1, 5, and 15, show no signiﬁcant impact of the
presence of such chemically diﬀerentiated mantle, but for slight
diﬀerences in the remnant mass in the case of a DDT explosion.

4.3.3. Mixing during carbon simmering

Convective mixing during carbon simmering is a potential
source of homogeneization of the WD composition prior to ex-
plosion. Assuming full chemical mixing of the initial WD mod-
els with MCO = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 M⊙ and default mantle com-
position, i.e. without carbon, the global 12C mass fractions are
X(12C) = 0.05, 0.07, and 0.09, respectively. Contrary to the re-
sults of chemically diﬀerentiated hybrid-cores described in pre-
vious sections, the composition and structure of the mantle may
have an inﬂuence on the outcome of fully mixed models. This
eﬀect is particularly relevant if the mantle is composed by two
layers, one of them rich in carbon, as assumed in some of the
models in Table 1 and section 4.3.2. For instance, assuming full
chemical mixing of the initial WD models with MCO = 0.2,
0.3, and 0.4 M⊙, a middle layer with no carbon and an ex-
ternal layer of Mext = 0.57 M⊙ with Xext(12C) = 0.32, the
global 12C mass fractions are X(12C) = 0.18, 0.20, and 0.23,
respectively. We have computed the explosion (DETO and DDT
modes) of two models representative of the class of homoge-
nized MSHC models, one in which X(12C) = 0.10 and the other
with X(12C) = 0.20 (models 24 – 27 in Table 1).

Pure detonation of these homogeneous models (24 and 26)
are similar to the successful5 pure detonations of hybrid-cores
with MCO from 0.4 to 0.74 M⊙. They are able to propagate
across most of the WD, unbinding the whole star and ejecting
a huge mass of 56Ni. The impact of mixing on the result of pure
detonations is, thus, to eliminate the diversity on the outcomes,
in particular the possibility that the explosion leaves a massive
bound remnant.

The delayed detonation of the homogeneous model with
X(12C) = 0.10 (model 25), is not able to unbind the WD com-
pletely. The small mass fraction of 12C makes the release of nu-
clear energy too small to initiate a healthy detonation, and the
burning front dies after having consumed ∼ 0.35 M⊙. The ﬁ-
nal result is rather similar to that of the pure detonation of the
hybrid-core case with MCO = 0.2 M⊙.

The delayed detonation of the homogeneous model with
X(12C) = 0.20 (model 27), leads to outcomes similar to those
obtained from the hybrid core cases with the same ρDDT and
MCO > 0.2 M⊙.

We have also computed the explosion (DDT model 28) of a
homogeneous model with chemical composition obtained from
the full mixing of the hybrid core model 23 (middle panel in
Fig. 1). In this case, the global carbon mass fraction is X(12C) =
0.28, quite close to its value in the hybrid core of model 23.

5 Here, by successful we mean that the detonation progressed
through a substantial fraction of the WD, as in models 16, 20, and 22,
whereas in models 15, 17, and 18 half of the WD mantle remained with
its original composition.

tion of X(12C) = X(16O) = 0.5, while solid squares are for initial

detonation initiation has succeeded, and ﬁnally fails to burn the
WD.

4.3. Parametricdependencies

We examine here what are the variations, if any, introduced by
changing the initial setup of the explosion models.

4.3.1. Composition of the mantle

Models 9 and 16 are similar to models 7 and 15 (pure detonations
of MCO = 0.3 and 0.4 M⊙), respectively, but with a higher 16O
abundance in the ONe mantle. The change of the composition
of the mantle has no eﬀect on the explosion of the model with
the smaller MCO. However, the detonation of the MCO = 0.4 M⊙
case is completely diﬀerent. With the larger 16O abundance, the
piston formed by the detonated carbon-rich region is energetic
enough to allow the incineration of almost the whole WD. This
shows how a moderate change in the initial conditions can have
a huge impact on the ﬁnal outcome of the explosion of these
structures, and that the MCO = 0.4 M⊙ case is on the frontier
between those that leave a massive bound-remnant and those that
produce a ejecta very rich in 56Ni.

We explored, in models 2 and 8, the eﬀect that a small resid-
ual abundance of 12C in the ONe mantle has on DETO models
with MCO = 0.2 and 0.3 M⊙ cases (to be compared to mod-
els 1 and 7). For the smaller MCO, there is no change at all. For
the 0.3 M⊙ case the only change is that the detonation pene-
trates slightly more in the ONe mantle, not enough to make a
healthy explosion, but the ejecta mass is larger, 0.49 M⊙ instead

E. Bravo et al.: Hybrid CONe cores explosion

Indeed, the outcome of the delayed detonation of both models
reported in Table 1 is within 2–3% of each other. All in all, suc-
cessful delayed-detonations of homogeneous models seem to en-
compass a narrower range of ejecta properties than their hybrid-
core counterparts.

We conclude that the main eﬀect of the eventual destruction
of the chemically diﬀerentiated structure (hybrid-core) during
the carbon simmering phase is a reduction on the variation of
the possible outcomes, but they do not aﬀect qualitatively the
properties of successful explosions.

4.3.4. Comparison to Kromer et al. (2015)

The initial model in Kromer et al. (2015) was a cold chemically-
diﬀerentiated WD with central density 2.9 × 109 g cm−3. Their
chemical structure consisted of a carbon rich, X(12C) = 0.5, core
of MCO = 0.2 M⊙ surrounded by an ONe layer of 0.9 M⊙ (with
a 3% carbon abundance by mass) and topped by a CO layer of
0.3 M⊙. This initial model is most similar to those of our models
1-6.

The main diﬀerence between our calculations and those of
Kromer et al. (2015) lies on the assumed geometrical conﬁgu-
ration of the ﬂame at runaway, a major unknown in theoretical
studies of SNIa explosion. While our simulations start, neces-
sarily (due to the one-dimensional nature of our code), from a
spherically symmetric volume at the center of the WD, they ig-
nite ﬁve kernels oﬀ-center. These kernels soon merge, forming a
one-sided plume that ﬂoats towards the surface while the ﬂame
grows in size. Finally, in the simulation of Kromer et al. (2015)
less than half the CO core is consumed by the deﬂagration, and
only 0.014 M⊙ of material is ejected, of which 3.4 × 10−3 M⊙
are 56Ni.

Unlike the model of Kromer et al. (2015), in all of our explo-
sion models 1-6 the whole CO core is consumed by the burning
front. Their ﬁnal results are intermediate between those of our
models 1-3 and 4-6. In the ﬁrst group, there is left a massive rem-
nant, as in Kromer et al. (2015) model, but no 56Ni is ejected. In
the second group, there is a small amount of 56Ni ejected, but
at a quite low velocity due to the large mass of the ejecta. We
speculate that, since the initial geometry of the ﬂame may not
be always the same, it is possible that all of these models are
realized in nature.

5. Discussion

The ultimate veriﬁcation of a supernova model relies on the com-
parison of synthetic spectra and light curves with observations.
However, our purpose in this work is to identify the most promis-
ing models for future computation of their optical properties. To
this aim, we base the following discussion on the location of
the computed models in the kinetic energy vs ejected 56Ni mass
plane (ﬁg. 2) and in the chemical proﬁle as a function of velocity
(ﬁg. 4).

In ﬁg. 2 we plot our reference models 29–32 (open triangles)
together with the models computed by Ohlmann et al. (2014),
who explored the delayed detonation of Chandrasekhar-mass
WDs with homogeneous composition and variable abundance of
12C, 0.2–0.5 in mass fraction (crosses). These models (labelled
”A” in the plot) help identify the combination of kinetic energy
and ejected mass of 56Ni necessary to obtain a normal SNIa,
K ≃ 1.0 − 1.5 × 1051 erg and 0.3–0.8 M⊙ of 56Ni (Mazzali et al.
2007; Woosley et al. 2007). The range of 56Ni masses can be
extended down to 0.08 M⊙ and up to 0.94 M⊙ to account for

8

the full set of SNIa that follow the light-curve luminosity-width
relation (dashed line) (Mazzali et al. 2007).

Pure detonation models that burn the ONe mantle (models
16, 20, 22, 24, and 26 in table 1, or “B“ in the plot) lie to the
right of the normal SNIa models, with similar kinetic energy but
much larger M(56Ni). These models burn almost all of the WD
at high density so they do synthesize at most a few thousandths
of a solar mass of IME, which is in clear contradiction with the
requirement of prominent Si and S absorption features that de-
ﬁne SNIa (aside from the absence of hydrogen). Such a kind of
object has never been observed. On the other hand, pure deto-
nations that did not succeed in burning a signiﬁcant fraction of
the ONe mantle leave a huge remnant and eject from a few hun-
dredths to a few tenths of a solar mass of material with the orig-
inal composition of the mantle, i.e. with no radioactive isotopes.
These explosions would not be detectable as a supernova, and
are labelled as ”no optical display“ in table 1. Their remnants
would expand due to its large energy content and the radioac-
tive input, and would remain as brighter-than-normal ONe WDs
during a Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale.

Region ”C“ in ﬁg. 2 is populated by delayed detonations of
hybrid-core WD with carbon-rich central volumes of 0.3 M⊙
or more, either chemically diﬀerentiated (models 10–14, 19,
21, 23) or homogeneous (models 27 and 28) at thermal run-
away. This group of models is characterized by slightly smaller
amounts of 56Ni ejected and substantially smaller kinetic en-
ergies than normal SNIa models. Both tendencies point to-
wards the subluminous class of SNIax. White et al. (2015) dis-
tinguishes two diﬀerent populations within the SNIax class. One,
that they call SN2002es-like, characterized by small dispersion
of light-curve properties with rise times slightly faster than nor-
mal SNIa, slow ejecta, and a preference for early-type host
galaxies. Their ejecta mass is thought to be of order ∼ 0.5 M⊙.
The other, that they call after SN2002cx, presents a larger dis-
persion of light-curve shapes but the rise times are consistently
slower than in normal SNIa, the ejecta speed is slightly faster
than in the SN2002es-like population, and they are usually
hosted by late-type galaxies. Their ejecta mass can be as large
as the Chandrasekhar-mass, depending on the eﬀective opacity
assumed by White et al. (2015) (but see McCully et al. 2014b).
The velocity distribution of the explosion products in some
delayed detonation models located in region ”C“ is shown in
ﬁg. 4, together with the result of the reference delayed detona-
tion model 30. Panel (a) displays the velocity distribution for the
LHC DDT model 23. Comparing with the bottom panel, (d), it is
clear that the LHC models are distinguished by Si and S extend-
ing up to much lower velocities than in the reference model6.
For instance, X(Si) ≥ 0.1 below ∼ 24, 000 km s−1 in the refer-
ence model, while the limit is ∼ 16, 000 km s−1 in the uppermost
panel, i.e. ∼ 8, 000 km s−1 slower. On the other side, the tip of
the 56Ni-rich core is ∼ 2, 000 km s−1 slower in the hybrid-core
model than in the reference model. The relatively short distance
between the radioactive core and the Si-rich region might ex-
plain the hotter than normal photospheres deduced for the SNIax
class.

Panels (b) and (c) of ﬁg. 4 display the chemical structure of
delayed detonations of both chemically diﬀerentiated and homo-
geneous models coming from MCO = 0.3 M⊙, MSHC models 12

6 In this comparison, we disregard the eﬀects due to the inclusion of
solar metallicity abundances in the pre-explosive structure of the refer-
ence model, which leaves an imprint in the 56Ni-rich core in the form
of large Mn and Ni abundances, and in the outermost layers as the pres-
ence of iron.

to bottom, hybrid WD with a MCO = 0.74 M⊙ (model 23), hybrid WD with MCO = 0.3 M⊙ (model 12), mixed model with initial

fractions of species with A ≥ 24 (model 30). The black thick line is the abundance by mass of 56Ni a few seconds after explosion.
The rest of lines give the abundance by mass of the most important elements after radioactive decays (i.e., the ﬁnal stable isotopes),
and have the following meaning: green stands for fuel (solid is C, short-dashed is O, long-dashed is Ne); blue stands for IME (solid
is Si, dotted is Mg, short-dashed is S, long-dashed is Ca); and red stands for IGE (solid is Fe, dotted is Cr, short-dashed is Mn,
long-dashed is Ni).

and 27. The structure of the 56Ni-rich inner ejecta is quite sim-
ilar to the other models shown in the same plot, still Si and S
extend to much smaller velocities, so they are even closer to the
radioactive core than they are in the LHC models. This trend is
suggestive of a correlation between dimmer objects and hotter

photospheres, but such a correlation has not yet been reported
for SN2002cx-like objects.

The SNIax group extend to quite low luminosities that re-
quire less than a hundredth of a solar mass of 56Ni ejected, e.g.
SN2008ha or SN2007qd. Models labelled as ”slow ejecta” in

E. Bravo et al.: Hybrid CONe cores explosion

table 1 (models 4–6, 15, 17, and 18, “D“ in ﬁg. 27 ) produce
and eject similar amounts of 56Ni. They are able, as well, to ac-
count for the small speciﬁc kinetic energy of the ejecta required
to explain these supernovae. However, the ejecta mass in the
models is close to the Chandrasekhar mass, while these events
are usually explained as low-mass ejecta (McCully et al. 2014b;
White et al. 2015). Since the energy released in these models is
close to the bounding energy of the progenitor WD, we cannot
discard that some multidimensional hydrodynamics eﬀect can
redistribute the kinetic energy in such a way that a larger remnant
is left. Interestingly, Kromer et al. (2015) show that an asym-
metrical pure deﬂagration of a hybrid-core Chandrasekhar-mass
WD can match the observational properties of SN2008ha, one
of the faintest SNIax ever recorded, although the ejected mass
seems to be too small to account for this particular supernova.
Nevertheless, the model was not specially tuned to reproduce
the observables of SN2008ha, and the parameter space was not
explored to ﬁnd a better agreement. So, it is likely that relatively
small diﬀerences in the initial model can result in a better ﬁt of
the properties of SN2008ha.

With respect to the other aforementioned subclasses of sub-
luminous SNIa, both the .Ia and the Ca-rich ones are not com-
patible with any of the models we have calculated. The .Ia class
is characterized by a very fast rise of the light curve, which is
at odds with the large mass of the ejecta we obtain (unless there
operates some multidimensional hydrodynamics eﬀect, as men-
tioned in the previous paragraph). On the other side, we do not
see any model that is particularly rich in calcium, as observed in
the Ca-rich group.

6. Conclusions

We have contributed to the study of the impact of hybrid-core
WDs on the understanding of SNIa and their diversity. We
have calculated the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass hybrid-
core WDs, with diﬀerent masses of the carbon-rich central vol-
ume. We aim to identify the combination of evolutionary sce-
nario and explosion mechanism that provide potential models
for peculiar SNIa, and whose light curve and spectra should be
addressed in future works.

Pure detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass CO WDs have
been dismissed for decades as possible mechanisms of SNIa ex-
plosion, because they turn almost the whole star into IGE ashes.
However, the presence of an ONe mantle in hybrid-core WDs
opened the possibility that pure detonations succeed in produc-
ing enough intermediate-mass elements to match the observa-
tional properties of, at least, some subgroup of SNIa. Our results
show that this is not the case. Indeed, the presence of an ONe
mantle may have a strong impact on the propagation of a deto-
nation, but the outcome is quite diﬀerent from any kind of ther-
monuclear supernova observed so far. If the carbon-rich region
is too small, MCO . 0.3 M⊙, the detonation dies shortly after
entering the ONe mantle, with the result that the nuclear energy
release is too small and most of the WD remains bound after the
thermonuclear event. A few tenths of a solar mass can be ejected,
but devoid of radioactive elements. As a result, nothing like a su-
pernova is to be expected. On the other hand, if the carbon-rich
region is large enough that the propagation of the detonation
through the ONe mantle can be sustained by the piston action
of the incinerated core, then almost the whole WD is burned to
ashes. In such a case, as in the pure CO composition case, the

ejecta would contain no IMEs, in contradiction with SNIa ob-
servations. The same result is obtained if the chemical compo-
sition is mixed just before thermal runaway, during the carbon
simmering phase, even for small masses of the carbon-rich cen-
tral volume. We conclude that pure detonations in hybrid-core
WDs can be discarded as the explosion mechanism behind any
known class of SNIa, just as for pure CO WDs.

But, if the explosion mechanism is of the delayed detona-
tion kind, the properties of the ejecta from hybrid-core WDs are
reminiscent of the subluminous class SNIax, in particular the
SN2002cx-like population (White et al. 2015). They are charac-
terized by slower velocities than our reference models, that can
explain normal SNIa, and a smaller extent of the Si and S-rich
layers, which are closer to the 56Ni-rich core. We suggest that
the proximity of the IMEs to the radioactive sources may ex-
plain the hot photospheres often detected in SNIax, which would
imply an inverse correlation between photosphere temperature
and supernova luminosity. Our simulations of delayed detona-
tions of hybrid-core WDs are scarcely sensitive to the mixing of
the chemical composition during the carbon simmering phase.
Another appealing feature of hybrid-core WDs as SNIax pro-
genitors is that they come from stars more massive than CO WDs
do and the secondary must be heavier than 3 − 4 M⊙ (see sec-
tion 2), which may explain in a natural way the preference of
SN2002cx-like objects for galaxies with active stellar formation
regions.

On the other hand, our models do not cover the whole range
of 56Ni ejected masses that seems to be implied by current obser-
vations of SNIax. Speciﬁcally, we do not ﬁnd models that leave
a massive remnant and eject a 56Ni mass as small as 0.1 M⊙ or
less (the smallest amount of 56Ni in our models is 0.27 M⊙, but
its precise value depends on the assumed ρDDT). This could be
related to the limitations implicit in our one-dimensional study
of the explosion of hybrid-core WDs. For instance, our delayed-
detonation explosions of carbon-rich central volumes of 0.2 M⊙
eject a few hundredths of a solar mass of 56Ni, but the whole
ejecta mass is too large for the imparted kinetic energy. In this
case, the expected light curve would be much wider than ob-
served. In an asymmetrical event, some bullets of 56Ni-rich mat-
ter could ﬂoat through the ONe mantle during the deﬂagration
phase of the explosion, redistributing the energy in such a way
that the ejecta mass were smaller (Bravo & Garc´ıa-Senz 2006,
2009), i.e. closer to that needed to explain the dimmest SNIax.

The explosions we have calculated are restricted to
Chandrasekhar-mass WDs, that could arise either from the SD or
the DD (slow merger) scenario. However, hybrid-core WDs may
experience a thermonuclear explosion in other scenarios, like
double-detonations of subChandrasekhar-mass WDs, explosions
of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs surrounded by a low-density halo
(coming from a DD merger), violent mergers, and violent col-
lisions, several of which require multidimensional simulations.
We will explore such kind of problems in future works.
