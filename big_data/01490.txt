ABSTRACT

We use the Los Alamos VPIC code to investigate particle acceleration in relativistic, unmagnetized,
collisionless electron-ion plasmas. We run our simulations both with a realistic proton-to-electron
mass ratio mp/me = 1836, as well as commonly employed mass ratios of mp/me = 100 and 25, and
show that results diﬀer among the diﬀerent cases. In particular, for the physically accurate mass ratio,
electron acceleration occurs eﬃciently in a narrow region of a few hundred inertial lengths near the
ﬂow front, producing a power law dN/dγ ∼ γ−p with p ∼ −2 developing over a few decades in energy,
while acceleration is weak in the region far downstream. We ﬁnd 20%, 10%, and 0.2% of the total
energy given to the electrons for mass ratios of 25, 100, and 1836 respectively at a time of 2500w−1
p .
Our simulations also show signiﬁcant magnetic ﬁeld generation just ahead of and behind the the ﬂow
front, with about 1% of the total energy going into the magnetic ﬁeld for a mass ratio of 25 and 100,
and 0.1% for a mass ratio of and 1836. In addition, lower mass ratios show signiﬁcant ﬁelds much
further downstream than in the realistic mass ratio case. Our results suggest the region and energetic
extent of particle acceleration is directly related to the presence of magnetic ﬁeld generation. Our work
sheds light on the understanding of particle acceleration and emission in gamma-ray bursts, among
other relativistic astrophysical outﬂows, but also underscores the necessity of optimizing numerical
and physical parameters, as well as comparing among PIC codes before ﬁrm conclusions are drawn
from these types of simulations.

1. INTRODUCTION

Highly relativistic outﬂows occur in a variety of astro-
physical objects, with particular relevance to gamma-ray
bursts and active galactic nuclei. Radiation from very
high energy particles is observed in these (and indeed
many other astrophysical) environments. For example,
gamma-ray bursts emit photons over a wide range of en-
ergies, extending to ∼ 100 GeV (Abdo et al. 2009), with
most of the energy emitted in the ∼ 10keV − 1M eV
range during the ﬁrst 100 seconds or so. Their spectra
appear to have both a thermal and non-thermal com-
ponent, with the latter usually dominant (Guiriec et al.
2013, 2014, 2015; however, see Vurm & Beloborodov 2015
who argue that the γ-ray spectrum can take on a non-
thermal shape due to various dissipation processes below
the photosphere). This apparent non-thermal spectrum
suggests that the underlying energy distribution of radi-
ating particles is a power-law that extends to very high
energies γ ≥ hundreds (see, e.g., Lloyd-Ronning & Pet-
rosian 2001, for a discussion relating the observed photon
spectrum to the underlying particle energy distribution).
Although the emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts
has itself been a long-standing open problem in this ﬁeld
(see Pe‘er 2015, for a recent review of GRB emission
mechanisms), perhaps an even more fundamental and
pressing problem is how the radiating particles achieve
a non-thermal distribution - in other words, what is the
mechanism by which they are accelerated to such high

lloyd-ronning@lanl.gov

energies? And, given that most of the energy is emitted
in this regime, how is it that such a high eﬃciency of
particle acceleration is achieved?

It was realized early on (e.g. Fermi 1949; Krymsky
1977; Bell 1978; Axford et al. 1977; Blandford & Ostriker
1978) that non-relativistic shocks can be an eﬃcient ac-
celerator of particles via the so-called ﬁrst order Fermi
mechanism, by which particles gain energy from repeated
crossings of a shock front. It is relatively straightforward
to show that for an isotropic distribution of electrons in a
non-relativistic, plane-parallel shock, a balance between
particle crossings and escape leads to a power-law dis-
tribution of electron energies dN/dE ∼ E−p, with an
index of p that depends only on the shock compression
ratio. For strong shocks of adiabatic index 5/3 (non-
relativistic), this universal index is p = 2. (Baring 1997,
and references therein).

The Fermi mechanism is complicated in the case of
relativistic shocks. Relativistic shocks, with adiabatic
index 4/3, are more compressible than non-relativistic
shocks so we would expect a diﬀerent power-law index
for the distribution of their energies. However, there is
not a straightforward relation between the power-law in-
dex p and shock compression ratio in the relativistic case.
This is because the underlying assumption of isotropy no
longer applies. Nonetheless, although relativistic shocks
move fast enough such that escape can be greater than
scattering across the shock front (so that an isotropic dis-
tribution is not achieved), each somewhat rare scattering
provides a signiﬁcant energy boost to a particle compared

2

to the non-relativistic case. Hence, a power-law for the
energy distribution is still expected (Kirk & Schneider
1987; Ellison et al. 1990), even though a straightforward
analytic calculation of this index is lacking.

And, of course, there are other possible mechanisms
of acceleration possibly at work in relativistic outﬂows.
When the plasma Alfven velocity βa = B/(4πnmc2)1/2
(in units of the speed of light) is comparable to the shock
velocity, particles can be quickly accelerated behind the
shock in what is known as the second-order Fermi process
or stochastic acceleration (Fermi 1949, 1954; Davis 1956;
Schlickeiser 1989; Park & Petrosian 1995). Alternatively,
it has been recently shown that magnetic reconnection
can eﬃciently accelerate particles in the case of plasmas
with high magnetization (Guo et al. 2014, 2015; Liu et
al. 2014; Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014; Kagan et al. 2013).
It is fair to conclude the details of the physics of parti-
cle acceleration in many astrophysical contexts is still an
open question. In this paper, we attempt to shed light
on this issue by examining acceleration in relativistic, un-
magnetized collisionless plasmas, using the Los Alamos
VPIC code.

1.1. Why use Particle-In-Cell codes?

The basic idea of a PIC code is straightforward:

in-
dividual computational particles are tracked in phase
space, the currents and charges from these particles are
computed, and the resulting ﬁelds are calculated directly
by solving Maxwells equations on a grid. Each parti-
cle’s position and momentum is updated via the self-
consistently calculated ﬁelds. In the case of a collisionless
plasma (applicable to GRBs), we solve the relativistic
Vlasov-Maxwell equations:

∂fs

mc ( ¯E + cγ−1 ¯u × ¯B) · ¯▽ufs = 0

∂ ¯B

∂t + cγ−1 ¯u · ¯▽fs + q
∂t = − ¯▽ × ¯E
∂t = ǫ−1 ¯▽ × µ−1 ¯B − ǫ−1 ¯J − ǫ−1σ ¯E

∂ ¯E

where f (¯r, ¯u, t) is the phase-space distribution of a
species s with particle charge q, and mass m, c is the
speed of light in vacuum, ¯u is the particle momentum,
and γ is the relativistic Lorentz factor (√1 + u2). The
parameters ¯E and ¯B are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
and ¯J is the current density, while ǫ, µ and σ are the
background medium permittivity, permeability, and con-
ductivity tensors respectively. PIC simulations sample
f with a collection of computational particles, where
each computational particle represents a sample of many
physical particles. The PIC simulations solve the parti-
cles equation of motion in the presence of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds:

dr

du

mc [ ¯E + cγ−1 ¯u × ¯B]

dt = cγ−1 ¯u
dt = q
As mentioned above, the electric current is then com-
puted from the particle motion, which is then used to
compute the corresponding electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
The details of a PIC simulation lie in how the particles
are advanced, and corresponding ﬁelds computed on the
computational grid. The Los Alamos VPIC code uses an
explicit-implicit mixture of leap-frog, Verlet, exponential
diﬀerencing, and Boris magnetic ﬁeld rotations. VPIC
computes the electric and magnetic ﬁelds staggered on

the computational grid in an energy-conserving force
interpolation scheme. The ﬁelds satisfy a discretized
charge continuity relation so charge conservation is up-
held. The details of the particle mover and ﬁeld com-
putation in VPIC can be found in Bowers et al. 2008,
2009.

PIC codes have proven to be a powerful computa-
tional method to reproduce the behavior of a plasma,
particularly for long wavelength modes. They have re-
produced the results in the cases in which analytical work
on plasmas is possible. For example, an unmagnetized
plasma with a temperature anisotropy (or, analogously,
a counter-streaming ﬂow) is expected to generate large
scale magnetic ﬁelds due to a Weibel-like instability and,
indeed, PIC simulations have shown such ﬁelds do arise
and are quantitatively in agreement with linear theory
(e.g. Kazimura et al. 1998). Most of this work has been
done in the context of non-relativistic or mildly relativis-
tic plasmas. In the case of relativistic plasmas, of interest
to gamma-ray bursts and many other astrophysical sce-
narios, analytic theory is diﬃcult and non-linear eﬀects
make such a treatment non-tenable. Large scale simula-
tions are required to capture the physics of the plasma,
and PIC codes are ideally suited to do so.

Some groups have investigated relativistic plasmas
with PIC codes. The particular problem of magnetic
ﬁeld generation and particle acceleration in the context
of gamma-ray bursts has been investigated in certain spe-
cialized regimes (e.g., Nishikawa et al. 2005; Hededal et
al. 2004; Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2007; Spitkovsky 2008;
Keshet et al. 2009; Nishikawa et al. 2009; Sironi et al.
2013; Choi et al. 2014; Ardaneh et al. 2015). How-
ever, the computational technicalities and approxima-
tions made between diﬀerent PIC codes deem it nec-
essary to make comparisons among groups in order to
put the results on ﬁrm footing. In particular, many of
the PIC simulations of relativistic shocks have been for
only a few particles per computational cell, and - more
importantly - an unphysical proton-to-electron mass ra-
tio. The advantage of the Los Alamos VPIC code is the
codes ability to handle and improve upon these limiting
approaches.

1.2. Aim of This Paper

The main goal of this paper is to present the results of
particle acceleration from VPIC simulations of relativis-
tic, unmagnetized, collisionless electron-ion plasmas, for
three diﬀerent proton-to-electron mass ratios (25, 100,
and the physically accurate 1836) and compare the re-
sults. In §2, we describe our simulation set-up, and the
necessity of dealing with numerical Cherenkov radiation
in relativistic PIC simulations.
In §3, we present our
results, focusing in particular on the electron energy dis-
tribution, the primary radiating particles in gamma-ray
bursts. We show how the results diﬀer for diﬀerent mass
ratios in contrast to previous claims (e.g. Sironi et al.
2013), and that the diﬀerences are related to the mag-
netic ﬁeld generation/structure in each case. Discussion
and conclusions are presented in §4 and 5.

2. SIMULATION SET-UP

Our simulations are run in two dimensions (the simu-
lation region extends in x and z; however, the particles

and ﬁelds are tracked in three dimensions), in the refer-
ence frame of the far downstream region of the plasma.
In this frame, the contact discontinuity at time = 0 be-
tween the upstream and downstream region (on the left
boundary in the horizontal x direction) is represented
by a reﬂecting (for the particles), conducting (for the
ﬁelds) wall. The right boundary in the x-direction is ab-
sorbing for particles and ﬁelds, while upper and lower
boundaries are periodic. To compare with similar stud-
ies (e.g. Spitkovsky 2008; Sironi et al.
2013), par-
ticles are loaded as a Maxwellian with a temperature
T = 0.05mec2 = 25keV (i.e. a cold plasma), and then
boosted with a relativistic Lorentz factor of Γ = 15 to-
ward the reﬂecting/conducting wall. Note that, here, we
examine only the region in front of the contact disconti-
nuity. After time = 0, we call the region behind the ﬂow
front - but in front of the contact discontinuity - “down-
po = 0.026√γw−1
stream“. Our time step is 0.026w−1
pr ,
where wpo = (4πne2/m)1/2 is the non-relativistic plasma
frequency, and wpr = wpo/√γ is the relativistic plasma
frequency for particles with internal Lorentz factor γ
(note that for a cold plasma, as set up in the initial
conditions of these simulations, wpr = wpo). Our grid
scale is 0.06(c/wpo), in order to suﬃciently resolve the

relativistic Debye length λD = λDo /√Γ ∼ 0.05(c/wpo).

We have run test simulations with a grid scale < λD up
to >> λD and ﬁnd the results remain consistent as long
as our cell size is smaller than a few λD. Our box size
is 5000(c/wpo), and the simulations are run for up to
∼ 2500w−1
po . We use 4 particles-per-cell per species (8 to-
tal), with a proton-to-electron mass ratio of 25, 100, and
1836. We also ran simulations with a similar set up, but
with more particles-per-cell (from 20 to 50). We found
that the number of particles per cell does not signiﬁcantly
aﬀect our results, but that varying the proton-to-electron
mass ratio can change results markedly.

2.1. On Numerical Cherenkov

A very important issue that arises in any rela-
tivistic numerical simulation is the so-called numerical
Cherenkov radiation (e.g. Greenwood et al. 2004). In
such a scenario, the particle speed can sometimes exceed
the numerical speed of light, leading to unphysical, high
frequency electromagnetic ﬁelds. What is even worse,
these numerical ﬁelds can sometimes cause an anisotropic
particle heating which can lead to lower frequency modes
that appear identical to physical Weibel modes (but are
not). A robust and physically justiﬁed way of dealing
with this numerical artifact is necessary.

There are several techniques to do so.

For PIC
codes that use momentum conserving force-interpolation
schemes, a higher order particle shape function is used,
which helps mitigate the numerical Cherenkov eﬀect
(Meyers et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Eastwood,
1991). Various ﬁltering schemes are often employed to
lessen the numerical grid-scale modes (Greenwood et al.,
2004). Los Alamos VPIC code is currently set up to
damp the short wavelength/high frequency modes us-
ing a transverse current adjustment method (Eastwood,
1991; Bowers et al. 2008), which introduces a compu-
tationally inexpensive current ¯J = τ ∂t( ¯J − ▽ × µ ¯B)
that damps the unphysical, short wavelength, grid-scale
modes, using the damping parameter d = ∆t/τ . Of

1836, 100, and 25.

course, we must balance the amount of damping with
the preservation of any physical modes that may arise on
these scales. We have attempted to mitigate the numeri-
cal Cherenkov through both a highly resolved spatial grid
and time step, and employing the damping parameter
mentioned above. We found that a damping parameter
d = 0.3, suppresses the numerical noise without aﬀecting
the physical results of simulations. We have also checked
for artiﬁcial numerical heating by monitoring the far up-
stream particle distribution, and have conﬁrmed that this
distribution retains its original form throughout our en-
tire simulation. Figure 1 shows the global energy con-
servation in the simulations presented in this paper for
the three mass ratios employed and for a damping pa-
rameter d = 0.3. We note that energy conservation is
worse for lower mass ratios and does not appear to con-
verge; however, for the length of our simulations energy
is conserved within 1.5%.

3. RESULTS

We ran our simulations according the set-up described
in §2, varying the particles per cell, damping parameter,
and - most importantly - the proton-to-electron mass ra-
tio. As discussed above, varying the particles per cell
and damping parameter did not have an appreciable af-
fect on our results. Therefore, below we present the re-
sults for varying the mass ratio alone, and focus on the
resultant electron energy distribution (in the context of
GRBs, electrons radiate most of the energy, and we are
ultimately interested in connecting this to the observed
photon distribution). The mass ratio aﬀects our results,
in terms of the density structure of the ﬂow, magnetic
ﬁeld generation, and particle acceleration. As one might
expect, the lower mass ratios give results closer to the
case of a pure pair plasma (see, e.g., Spitkovsky 2008b),
while the physically realistic mass ratio shows some in-
teresting diﬀerences.

Figures 2,3, and4 show the fraction of energy in
the ions, electrons and magnetic ﬁeld for the cases of
mp/me = 25, 100 and 1836 respectively.
In all three
cases, the ions slightly lose energy as a function of time
in the simulation, as the energy of the electrons and
magnetic ﬁeld increases (note the diﬀerent scales on

the y-axes of the ﬁgures). For the lowest mass ratio,
mp/me = 25, we ﬁnd about 20% of the energy in the

electrons and 1% in the magnetic ﬁeld by then end of
our simulation runs (twp ∼ 2500). For mp/me = 100,
these numbers change to about 10% of energy in the
electrons and 0.8% in the magnetic ﬁeld. Finally, for
the realistic mass ratio of 1836, 0.2% of the energy is in
the electrons, while about 0.1% is in the magnetic ﬁeld.
These values are in the expected range for GRBs, based
on estimates from their spectra and light curves (see, e.g.
Beniamini et al. (2015), who discuss constraints on ǫB
in particular).

3.0.1. Magnetic Field and Particle Densities

Figures 5 and 6 show the y-component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld at early times for mp/me = 25 and 1836 re-
spectively (for brevity, we show the extremes of the mass
ratios we used). The magnetic ﬁeld develops from a two-
stream instability, and is sustained in the downstream
region for mp/me = 25, whereas it decays much more
quickly (< 100 inertial lengths) when the physical value
of the proton-to-electron mass ratio is used. Figures 7
and 8 show the absolute value of the y component of the
magnetic ﬁeld cases of mp/me = 25 and 1836 respec-
tively. This appears to be consistent with Lemoine 2015
who showed analytically that magnetic turbulence is sig-
niﬁcantly damped downstream, with higher mass ratio
plasmas damping at a faster rate than lower mass ratio
plasmas.

The electron density (normalized to the upstream den-
sity) is shown in ﬁgures 9 and 10 for the lower and re-
alistic mass ratios respectively, while ﬁgures 11 and 12
show the ion density (again normalized to the upstream
value) at a representative time of twp ∼ 1600. The lower
mass ratio plasmas show a shock developing with an av-
erage value of the ratio of downstream to upstream den-
sity of ∼ 3 as expected from 2D relativistic shock jump
conditions (Spitkovsky 2008). The realistic mass ratio
case shows a narrow shock (∼ 500 inertial lengths) just
behind the ﬂow front for the electron density, and signif-
icant density structure for the ions. Our most signiﬁcant
result here is that the shock in the electron density does
not extend far downstream for a realistic mass ratio, but
does when a lower mass ratio is employed. We will dis-
cuss the implications of this below.

3.0.2. Particle Energy Spectrum

Figures 13, 14, and 15 show the electron kinetic en-
ergy distribution (γ − 1)dN/dγ vs. (γ − 1) for the three
mass ratios we employed in a 200c/wp slice in x at three
diﬀerent times. Figure 13 shows the particle energy spec-
trum at a time twp ≃ 300, in a region about 300 inertial
lengths from the contact discontinuity (left boundary).
At this time, the ﬂow front is in the slice we are exam-
ining, and all three particle energy spectra are similar,
with a power-law developing oﬀ the initial thermal peak.
Figures 14 and 15 show the particle energy distribution
at twp = 1000 and 2200 respectively, again in a 200c/wp
wide region around the shock front. One can see the
results of the particle energy spectra for the diﬀerent
mass ratios diverge with time, with the higher mass ra-
tio giving rise to higher energy electrons and an extended
power-law. The lower mass ratios show a secondary high
energy bump, with maximum energies that remain be-
low that of the realistic mass ratio case. The magenta
dashed line in the last ﬁgure (mass ratio of 25), can be

a similar spectrum for the electrons at this time. At
later times, we ﬁnd the maximum electron Lorentz factor

with the scaling found in Sironi et al. (2013). The real-
istic mass ratio of 1836 shows a scaling γmax ∝ (twp)∼1,
consistent with a classic Bohm scaling law ∝ t1.
Figures 16 and 17 show the electron energy distribution
for a 200c/wp slice 1000, and 2000 inertial lengths down-

stream, respectively, from the ﬂow front at twp = 2200.
Within 1000 inertial lengths of the front, the three spec-
tra overlap, but as we look further downstream, only
the lower mass ratios show acceleration in this region.
In other words, acceleration occurs for the realistic mass
ratio in only a narrow (∼ hundreds of inertial lengths)
region around the shock front, while lower mass ratios
show acceleration over a much extended region of thou-
sands of inertial lengths. The region of acceleration di-
rectly corresponds to both the presence of a shock and
extent of magnetic ﬁeld generation among the diﬀerent
mass ratios.

Finally, Figures 18, 19, and 20 show the parti-
cle energy distribution evolution (for times twp =
0, 500, 1500, 2500) over the entire simulation box, for the
mass ratios of 25, 100, and 1836 respectively. For the
lower mass ratio cases, we see a steep power-law at early
times (∆twp ∼ 500); at a later times, we ﬁnd a very
ﬂat, hard spectrum oﬀ the initial thermal peak out to
some high lorentz factor (γe ∼ 200 for the mass ratio
of 25 and γ ∼ 400 for the mass ratio of 100), and then
a sharp drop-oﬀ after that. For the realistic mass ratio
case, we see simply an extended power-law of index ∼ 2
(in dN/dγ) develop oﬀ the initial thermal peak, extend-
ing over almost 2 decades in energy at late times. The
diﬀerence in the shapes of the particle energy spectra for
diﬀerent mass ratios can be attributed to the diﬀerences
in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld. As we discussed
above, the realistic mass ratio case shows strong ﬁeld
generation at the ﬂow front and rapid (a few hundred
inertial lengths) decay downstream, whereas the lower
mass ratio cases show signiﬁcant ﬁeld presence down-
stream. This suggests the magnetic turbulence as the
source of particle acceleration. This is why we ﬁnd ac-
celeration downstream in the lower mass ratio cases, but
not in the realistic mass ratio case.

4. DISCUSSION

The diﬀerences in our results - particularly the shape
of the electron energy distribution - when employing dif-
ferent mass ratios in our PIC simulations can ultimately
be attributed to the details of the magnetic ﬁeld gener-
ation. There are two factors that each come into play
- the ability of the plasma to sustain a magnetic ﬁeld
in the downstream region, and the size of the magnetic
ﬁlaments relative to the particle gyroradius. Our simu-
lations show that electrons are accelerated in regions of
signiﬁcant magnetic ﬁeld, generated from a two-stream
(Weibel-like) instability mediated by the electrons (in-
deed analytic calculations easily show the electron Weibel
instability grows much faster than the ion Weibel in-
stability, since the growth rate is proportional to the
plasma frequency which in turn is proportional to the
inverse square root of the mass; see e.g. Stockem Novo
et al. 2015). This strongly suggests that scattering oﬀ
the magnetic turbulence plays a primary role in the elec-
tron acceleration. However, this scattering will only be
eﬃcient when particle gyro-radius (= mv⊥/eB, where m
is the particle mass, v⊥ is the component of velocity per-
pendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, e is the particle charge,
and B is the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld) is of order
the typical length scale of the magnetic ﬁlaments. These
ﬁlaments grow in time to a size ≤ pΓ/2c/wpe (Stockem
Novo et al. 2015) when the magnetic ﬁeld saturates, and

are therefore of the size or bigger than the electron gyro-
radius rg,e ∼ B−1
P IC c/wpe, where BP IC is the normalized
value of the magnetic ﬁeld in our simulations. This im-
plies the magnetic turbulence is able to scatter electrons
eﬀectively, which allows them to cross the shock and gain
energy. 1 And ﬁnally, as mentioned above, because the
magnetic ﬁeld decays downstream in the realistic case
(but not for lower mass ratios), there is no acceleration
downstream in contrast to lower mass ratios in which a
ﬁeld can be sustained downstream. We plan to explore
the details of the acceleration process using a particle
tracking method, which we defer to a future paper.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have investigated particle accelera-
tion in relativistic ﬂows (Γ = 15) for electron-ion plas-
mas for three diﬀerent proton-to-electron mass ratios
(25, 100, &1836), using the Los Alamos VPIC code. We

1 For small mass ratios, the magnetic ﬁeld will also scatter the
ions (with gyro-radii rg,i = mp/merg,e - i.e.
smaller mass ra-
tios have smaller ion gyro-radii), and the energy is shared between
electrons and ions as born out by the simulations. For realistic
mass ratios, the ion gyro-radius is much larger than the magnetic
ﬁlaments and therefore the ions are unable to be scattered and
accelerated.

ﬁnd a marked diﬀerence in our results when we change
the mass ratio. Our main conclusions are:

1. The magnetic ﬁeld decays quickly (within a few
hundred inertial lengths) downstream for a realistic
mass ratio, while it is sustained much further down-
stream for lower mass ratios (over thousands of in-
ertial lengths). For the realistic mass ratio case,

the region of magnetic ﬁeld generation, therefore,
is ∼ 500c/wp ∼ 108 cm n
, where n1 is the den-
sity normalized to units of 1cm−3. The typical ra-
dius of internal shocks is expected to be ∼ 1012cm
(e.g. Gehrels et al. 2009). Hence, the region of ﬁeld
generation is extremely narrow compared to radius
at which the shocks occur. This has important
implications for the interpretation of the prompt
emission as we discuss below. The total amount of
energy in the magnetic ﬁeld at twp ∼ 2500 is ∼ 1%,
1%, and 0.1% for mass ratios of 25, 100 and 1836
respectively.

2. The electron energy distribution varies signiﬁcantly
at late times (twp > 500) between simulations
with diﬀerent proton-to-electron mass ratios. For
a realistic mass ratio, we ﬁnd particles accelerated
to higher energies for higher mass ratios, with a
power-law of index −2 (in dN/dγ) developing over
a couple of decades in energy. The lower mass ra-
tio simulations show a ﬂat, hard spectrum oﬀ the
initial thermal peak and then a sharp decline.

3. In the case of a realistic mass ratio, particles ap-
pear to be accelerated primarily at the ﬂow front
in a fairly narrow region ∼ hundreds of inertial
lengths, which directly coincides with the region
of magnetic ﬁeld generation. The particle energy
spectrum downstream from the shock shows little
acceleration for the realistic mass ratio case, and
therefore acceleration can be attributed to the pres-
ence of magnetic turbulence.

Ions are not signiﬁcantly accelerated in our simulations,
with less acceleration for higher proton-to-electron mass
ratios. However, we have only run the simulations for a
few hundred inverse ion plasma frequencies. In a future
publication, we plan to explore the behavior of the ion
spectrum in more detail. If indeed there is little accel-
eration in the case of a realistic proton-to-electron mass
ratio, this has implications for GRBs as the source of
high energy neutrinos.

The determination of both the magnetic ﬁeld and par-
ticle energy distribution in relativistic shocks are cru-
cial in attempting to understand the high energy emis-
sion from astrophysical environments. For example, for
an optically thin synchrotron photon spectrum from an
isotropic particle distribution with index p, we will ob-
serve a break in the spectrum that is proportional to the
square characteristic electron energy γ2
e and the ampli-
tude of the magnetic ﬁeld. The observed photon spec-
trum above this break is ∝ −(p + 2)/2 if particles lose
all of their energy to radiation quickly and −(p + 1)/2
if particles cool slowly or in a regime in which they are
quickly re-accelerated. Alternatively, if the particle en-
ergy power-law extends to very low energies (i.e. γmin is
below the detector range), the low energy spectral index
α will be related to the power law index p in the same
way as described for β above. Hence, the underlying

particle distribution and magnetic ﬁeld have signiﬁcant
consequences for the observed photon spectrum.

Our results show that particles can be accelerated to
very high energies, with varying behavior above the ther-
mal peak, and an asymptotic power-law of index −2 (in
dN/dγ) extending over about almost two decades in en-
ergy, when a realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio is em-
ployed. This is consistent with observations of gamma-
ray bursts which show a wide range of high energy behav-
ior (Guiriec et al. 2014, 2015). Our results also show that
the region of high magnetic ﬁeld and particle accelera-
−1/2
tion is fairly narrow (∼ hundreds c/wp = 108 cm n
;

we note this was also suggested in Hededal et al., 2004).
This has implications for interpreting GRB emission, jus-
tifying assumptions of a thin emission region (Mesler et
al. 2012, 2014), and weakening the argument for smear-
ing of features in the light curve due to the radial extent
of the emission (e.g. Gat et al. 2013; note, however, that
angular eﬀects must still be included and will contribute
to the smearing).

Finally, our results have implications for choices of mi-
crophysical parameters (e.g. ǫe and ǫB) when modelling
high energy emission from astrophysical sources. There
is signiﬁcant variation of these parameters behind the
shock - in particular, ǫB decays behind the ﬂow front in
the realistic mass ratio case. This should be accounted
for in any detailed modelling of emission from relativistic
shocks.

We emphasize that we have only run our simulations
for 2500w−1
seconds in the frame of the
contact discontinuity. These are short timescales in the
context of GRBs (in which a typical pulse lasts from mil-
liseconds to ∼ 10 seconds). However, our primary point
is that there is already a clear and growing divergence
of results between the realistic mass case and artiﬁcial
lower mass ratios, in contrast to previous claims that
simulations are not sensitive to this ratio. Hence, we
stress the importance of making comparisons among dif-
ferent particle-in-cell codes. We plan to continue explor-
ing these issues, in addition to extending our simulations
to longer times, and adding a particle tracker to discern
the details of the acceleration process.
