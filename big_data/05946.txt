1 Introduction

In this paper, we are concerned with the existence and multiplicity of multi-
bump type solutions for the following class of problems

(Pλ)

( ∆2u + (λV (x) + 1)u = f (u),
u ∈ H 2(R4);

in R4,

where ∆2 denotes the biharmonic operator, λ ∈ (0,∞), V : R4 → R is a
continuous and nonnegative potential such that Ω := int V −1(0) has k connected

components denoted by Ωj, j ∈ {1,··· , k} and f : R → R is a continuous
function with critical exponential growth, that is, f behaves like exp(α0s2) at
inﬁnity, for some α0 > 0. Namely, there exists α0 > 0 such that

f (s)

In the last years, problems involving the biharmonic operator has been
studied by many researchers, in part because this operator helps to describe the
mechanical vibrations of an elastic plate, which among other things describes the
traveling waves in a suspension bridge, see [7, 11, 12, 13, 14]. On the other hand,
the biharmonic draws attention by the diﬃculties encountered when trying to
adapt known results for the Laplacian, for example, we cannot always rely on a
maximum principle, and also, if u belongs to H 2(R4), we cannot claim that u±
belong to H 2(R4).

Concerned multi-bump type solutions, Ding and Tanaka in [9] have

considered the problem

( ˜Pλ)

(cid:26) −∆u + (λV (x) + Z(x))u = up,

u > 0, in RN ,

in RN ,

In that paper, they showed that problem ( ˜Pλ) has at least 2k − 1 multi-bump
type solutions, for λ large enough.The same type of result was obtained by
Alves, de Morais Filho and Souto in [1] and Alves and Souto [4], by assuming
that f has a critical growth for the case N ≥ 3 and critical exponential growth
when N = 2, respectively. More recently, Alves and Pereira, in [3] showed
the existence of nodal multi-bump solutions to a same type of problem, but
considering a general nonlinearity with critical exponential growth. Related to
the existence of multi-bump solutions for the biharmonic problem (Pλ), Alves
and N´obrega [2], developed a technique inspired in the works by Bartsch and
Wang [5, 6] to show the existence of multi-bump solution. This required, because
it is not clear that the celebrated method developed by del Pino and Felmer [8]
can be used to problems involving biharmonic operator.

In this work, we intend to prove the existence and multiplicity of multi-bump
positive solutions for problem (Pλ). Our main result completes the studies made
in the previous papers, because we will work with the biharmonic operator and
nonlinearity with a critical exponential growth. Since we will work with critical
exponential growth in whole R4, a key point in our arguments is the following
Adams-type inequality due to B. Ruf and F. Sani [15]:

Related to nonlinearity, we assume that f : R → R is a C1-function verifying

the following hypotheses:

2 Preliminary remarks

In this section we ﬁx some notations and introduce some preliminary results
that will be fundamental in the development of this work.

Hereafter, if Θ ⊂ R4 is a mensurable set, we denote Eλ(Θ) the space

assumptions (f1) and (f2), is a key point in this work:

The following estimate involving f , which is a consequence of our

Main estimate. Fixed q ≥ 0, η > 0 and τ > 1, there exists C > 0 such that

In what follows, we establish an important inequality used in this paper. Its

proof can be found in F. Sani [16].
Lemma 2.1 Let α > 0 and q ≥ 2. If M > 0 and αM 2 < 32π2 then there exists
a constant C = C(α, q, M ) > 0 such that

holds for any u ∈ H 2(R4) with kukH 2 ≤ M .

This inequality together with the Main estimate (2.5) implies that the energy

functional Iλ : Eλ → R, associated to (Pλ) given by

Iλ(u) =

is well deﬁned. Furthermore, using standard arguments, it is possible to prove
that Iλ is of class C1 with

I′λ(u)v =ZR4

(∆u∆v + (λV (x) + 1)uv)dx +ZR4

f (u)vdx for all u, v ∈ Eλ,

and its critical points are solutions of our problem (Pλ).

To ﬁnish this section, we state the following consequence of the Adams-type

inequality.

cc1 Corollary 2.2 Let {un} be a sequence in H 2(R4) with lim sup{kunk2

H 2} ≤ m <
1. For τ, q > 1 satisfying τ qm < 1, there exists C = C(τ, q, m) > 0 such that
bτ (un) := (e32π2τ u2

n − 1) belongs to Lq(R4) and

kbτ (un)kLq(R4) ≤ C.

Proof. Note that there exists C > 0 such that

|bτ (un)|q ≤ C(cid:16)e32π2(√τ qun)2

− 1(cid:17)

and since k√τ qunk2

H 2 ≤ τ qm < 1, from Adams-type inequality (1.2)

n {kbτ (un)kLq(R4)} < ∞

and the proof is completed.

3 The (P S)c Condition

In this section, we study some results about the Palais-Smale sequences related
to Iλ, that is, of sequences {un} ⊂ Eλ verifying

Iλ(un) → c

and I′λ(un) → 0,

for some c ∈ R (shortly {un} is a (P S)c sequence).

l1

Lemma 3.1 Let {un} ⊂ Eλ be a (P S)c sequence for Iλ, then {un} is bounded.
Furthermore,

An immediate consequence of the previous lemma is the following result.

c1 Corollary 3.2 Let {un} ⊂ Eλ be a (P S)0 sequence for Iλ. Then, un → 0 in

Eλ.

l2

Lemma 3.3 Let {un} be a (P S)c sequence for Iλ with c ∈ (0, S]. If un ⇀ u in
Eλ, then

Iλ(vn) − Iλ(un) + Iλ(u) = on(1)
I′λ(vn) − I′λ(un) + I′λ(u) = on(1),

where vn := un − u. Furthermore, {vn} is a (P S)c−Iλ(u) sequence.

8

Proof. Firstly, note that

Iλ(vn) − Iλ(un) + Iλ(u) =

(F (vn) − F (un) + F (u)) dx

(F (vn) − F (un) + F (u)) dx,

where R > 0 will be ﬁxed later on. Since, un ⇀ u in Eλ, we have

• un → u, in Lp(BR(0)), for p ≥ 1;
• un(x) → u(x), a.e. in R4.

Moreover, there are h1 ∈ L2(BR(0)) and h2 ∈ Lq(BR(0)) such that

|un(x)| ≤ h1(x), h2(x)

a.e. in R4.

By Lebesgue’s Theorem,

ZBR(0) |F (vn) − F (un) + F (u)| dx → 0.

(3.9)

8

On the other hand, using the Main Estimate on f and The Mean Value

Theorem, there is tn ∈ [0, 1] such that θn := tnvn + (1 − tn)un satisﬁes

|F (vn) − F (un)| ≤ η|f (θn)||u|

≤ η|θn||u| + C|u|bτ (θn)
≤ η(|un| + |u|)|u| + C|u|bτ (θn).

Then, by H¨older inequalities

ZR4\BR(0) |F (vn) − F (un)| ≤ η(kunkL2(R4\BR(0)) + kukL2(R4\BR(0)))kukL2(R4\BR(0))

where q′, q > 1 satisﬁes 1/q′ + 1/q = 1.

Since

where m =

lim supkθnkH 2 ≤ m′ < 1.

Consindering q > 1 suﬁciently close to 1 such that τ qm′ < 1, by Corollary
2.2, we get kbτ (θn)kLq(R4) ≤ C. Then, the above estimate combined with the
boundedness of {un} and Sobolev embeddings gives

L2(R4\BR(0))(cid:17)

+ CkukLq′ (R4\BR(0)).

Now, we can ﬁx R > 0 large enough verifying

ZR4\BR(0) |F (vn) − F (un)| dx ≤ ǫ.

Using again the Main Estimate on f we obtain

ZR4\BR(0) |F (u)| dx ≤ η ||u||2

L2(R4\BR(0)) + Ckukq

Lq(R4\BR(0)).

Then, increasing R if necessary, we can assume that

Hence,

By arbitrariness of ǫ, it follows that

ZR4\BR(0) |F (u)| dx ≤ ǫ.
ZR4\BR(0) |F (vn) − F (un) + F (u)| dx ≤ ǫ,

From (3.9) and (3.13), we get the ﬁrst of the identities. The second one follows
exploring the same type of arguments and the growth of f′.

l3

Lemma 3.4 Let {un} be a (P S)c sequence for Iλ with c ∈ (0, S]. Then, there
exists c∗ > 0, independent of λ, such that c ∈ [c∗, S].

10

Proof. The Lemma 2.1 together with the Sobolev embedding gives

I′λ(u)u ≥

1
2 ||u||2

λ − K ||u||q
λ ,

for some constant K > 0. Thus, there exists δ > 0 such that

I′λ(u)u ≥

4 ||u||2

λ , for ||u||λ ≤ δ.

(3.14)

11

Consider c∗ = δ2 θ − 2

2θ

and c ∈ (0, c∗). From Lemma 3.1,

lim sup

n→+∞ ||un||2

λ < δ2,

implying that for n large enough,

||un||λ ≤ δ.

(3.15)

12

Hence, (3.14) and (3.15) combine to give

I′λ(un)un ≥

1
4 ||un||2
λ ,

leading to

||un||2

λ → 0,

and so, Iλ(un) → Iλ(0) = 0. This contradicts the hypothesis that {un} is a
(P S)c sequence, with c > 0. Therefore, c ≥ c∗.
Lemma 3.5 Let {un} be a (P S)c sequence for Iλ, with c ∈ [0, S]. Then, there
exists δ0 > 0 independent of λ, such that

The following result is a consequence of hypothesis (V3) and its proof can be

found in [2, 5, 6].
Lemma 3.6 Let {un} be a (P S)c sequence for Iλ with c ∈ [0, S]. Given ǫ > 0,
there exist constants Λ, R > 0 such that

Lq(R4\BR(0)) ≤ ǫ,

for all λ ≥ Λ.

In the following result, we will show that the functional Iλ veriﬁes the (P S)c
condition to c ∈ [0, S] and λ large enough.

p1 Proposition 3.7 Let c ∈ [0, S]. Then, there exists Λ > 0 such that Iλ veriﬁes

the (P S)c condition, for all λ ≥ Λ.
Proof. Let {un} be a (P S)c sequence. By Lemma 3.1, {un} is bounded and
consequently, passing to a subsequence if necessary,

un ⇀ u in Eλ;
un(x) → u(x) a.e.
un → u in Ls
Then, I′λ(u) = 0 and Iλ(u) ≥ 0, because

Taking vn = un− u, we have by Lemma 3.3 that {vn} is a (P S)d sequence, with
d = c − Iλ(u). Furthermore,

0 ≤ d = c − Iλ(u) ≤ c ≤ S.

We claim that d = 0. Indeed, otherwise d > 0. Thereby, by Lemma 3.4 and
Lemma 3.5, d ≥ c∗ and

Applying the Lemma 3.6 with ǫ =

which is an absurd, because as vn ⇀ 0 in Eλ, the compact embedding

lim inf

n→+∞ kvnkq

Lq(BR(0)) = 0.

Therefore d = 0 and {vn} is a (P S)0 sequence. Then, by Corollary 3.2, vn → 0
in Eλ, or equivalently, un → u in Eλ, showing that for λ large enough, Iλ
satisﬁes the (P S)c condition for all c ∈ [0, S].

4 The (P S)∞ Condition
In this section, we will study the behavior of a (P S)∞ sequence, that is, a
sequence {un} ⊂ H 2(R4) satisfying:

un ∈ Eλn and λn → +∞;
Iλn (un) → c,
for some

λn → 0.

c ∈ [0, S];

that
(i) Ωj ⊂ Ω′j;
(ii) Ω′j ∩ Ω′l = ∅, for all j 6= l,
and for Γ ⊂ {1,··· , k}, Γ 6= ∅, let us deﬁne

subsequence of {un}, still denoted by itself, and u ∈ H 2(R4) such that

un ⇀ u in H 2(R4).

implying that {||un||λn} is bounded in R. As

||un||λn ≥ ||un||H 2(R4) , ∀n ∈ N,

{un} is also bounded in H 2(R4), and so, there exists a subsequence of {un},
still denoted by itself, and u ∈ H 2(R4) such that
un ⇀ u in H 2(R4).

To show (i), we ﬁx for each m ∈ N∗, the set

Therefore, u = 0 almost everywhere in Cm, and consequently, u = 0 almost
everywhere in R4 \ Ω. Besides, ﬁxing ϕ ∈ C∞0 (R4 \ Ω), we have

ZR4\Ω ∇u(x)ϕ(x)dx = −ZR4\Ω

u(x)∇ϕ(x)dx = 0,

from where it follows that

∇u(x) = 0, a.e. in R4 \ Ω.

Since ∂Ω is smooth , u ∈ H 2(R4 \ Ω) and ∇u ∈ H 1(R4 \ Ω), by Trace Theorem,
there are constants K1, K2 > 0 satisfying

and

||u||L2(∂Ω) ≤ K1 ||u||H 2(R4\Ω) = 0,

||∇u||L2(∂Ω) ≤ K2 ||∇u||H 1(R4\Ω) = 0,

Since {un} is a (P S)∞ sequence, we derive that

5 The Existence of Multi-bump Solutions

In this section, we denote by Iλ,j : H 2(Ω′j) → R the functional given by

Iλ,j (u) =

jh|∆u|2 + (λV (x) + 1)|u|2i dx −ZΩ′

F (u)dx.

j

It follows from [16] that Ij and Iλ,j, where Ij is the functional deﬁned in
the section 2, satisfy the mountain pass geometry. Hereafter, we denote by cj
and cλ,j the mountain pass levels related to the functionals Ij and Iλ,j. Since
those functionals satisfy to the Palais-Smale condition in the interval [0, S] and
cλ,j ≤ cj ≤ S, for all j ∈ {1,··· , k}, we conclude from Mountain Pass Theorem
due to Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz that there exist wj ∈ H 2
0 (Ω′j)
such that

0 (Ωj) and vj ∈ H 2

Ij (wj) = cj, Iλ,j(vj ) = cλ,j and I′j (wj) = I′λ,j (vj) = 0.

In what follows, consider Γ = {1, 2,··· , l}, with l ≤ k, and cΓ =

ﬁx ǫ > 0 and ζ > 0 such that

lXj=1

Ij ((1 − ǫ)wj, Ij ((1 + ǫ)wj ) < cj − ζ,∀j ∈ Γ.
Let us set Q = (1 − ǫ, 1 + ǫ)l and deﬁne γ0 : Q → Eλ by

γ0(−→s )(x) =

lXj=1

sjwj(x), ∀−→s = (s1,··· , sl) ∈ Q.

17

In the case of polynomial subcritical growth (N ≥ 4), Alves and N´obrega in [2]
considered a cube ˜Q = (1/R2, 1)l, where R > 0 was chosen large, thus | ˜Q| was
near to 1. In our case, since we are working with critial exponential growth, we
need to consider a cube Q = (1 − ǫ, 1 + ǫ)l, where ǫ > 0 will be taken small,
which implies |Q| is near to 0.
In what follows, we denote by Σλ the class of continuous path γ ∈ C(Q, Eλ\
{0}) satisfying the following conditions:
(a)

γ = γ0 on ∂(Q)

and

Notice that Σλ 6= ∅, because γ0 ∈ Σλ.

Using the class Σλ, we deﬁne the following minimax level

Iλ(γ(−→s )).

l6

Lemma 5.1 For each γ ∈ Γ∗, there is −→t ∈ Q verifying
I′λ,j(γ(−→t ))γ(−→t ) = 0, for j ∈ Γ.

Proof. Given γ ∈ Σλ, consider the mapeγ : Q → Rl deﬁned by
eγ(−→s ) =(cid:0)I′λ,1(γ(−→s ))γ(−→s ),··· , I′λ,l(γ(−→s ))γ(−→s )(cid:1) .
For −→s ∈ ∂(Q), we know that

γ(−→s ) = γ0(−→s ).

Then, I′λ,j (γ0(−→s ))(γ0(−→s )) = 0 which implies

In fact, otherwise

sj 6∈ {1 − ǫ, 1 + ǫ},∀j ∈ Γ.

I′λ,j(γ0(−→s ))(γ0(−→s )) = 0

for sj = (1 − ǫ) or sj = (1 + ǫ), that is,
or

I′j ((1 − ǫ)wj)((1 − ǫ)wj) = 0

implying that

I′j((1 + ǫ)wj)((1 + ǫ)wj) = 0

Ij((1 − ǫ)wj) ≥ cj

or

Ij ((1 + ǫ)wj ) ≥ cj,

18

which contradicts the choice of ǫ. Hence,

Then, by Topological Degree

(0, 0,··· , 0) 6∈eγ(∂(Q)).

deg(eγ, Q, (0, 0,··· , 0)) = (−1)l 6= 0,
from where it follows that there exists −→t ∈ Q satisfying
I′λ,j (γ(−→t ))(γ(−→t )) = 0, for j ∈ Γ.

For each γ ∈ Σλ and −→t ∈ Q as in Lemma 5.1, we ﬁnd

Iλ,j (γ(−→t )) ≥ cλ,j,∀j ∈ Γ,

where we have used the following characterization of cλ,j

cλ,j = inf{Iλ,j(u); u ∈ Eλ \ {0}; I′λ,j (u)u = 0}.

On the other hand, recalling that Iλ,R4\Ω′

Γ

(γ(−→s )) ≥ 0, we have

Iλ(γ(−→s )) ≥

Iλ,j (γ(−→s )),

and so,

lXj=1

The last inequality combined with the deﬁnition of bλ,Γ gives

bλ,Γ ≥

cλ,j,

lXj=1

This completes the proof of a).

b) As γ(−→s ) = γ0(−→s ) on ∂(Q), we derive that

Iλ(γ0(−→s )) =

lXj=1

Ij(sj wj),∀−→s ∈ ∂(Q).

Since

and there is j0 ∈ Γ, such that sj0 ∈ {(1 − ǫ), (1 + ǫ)}, we have

Ij (sjwj) ≤ cj,

∀j ∈ Γ

Iλ(γ0(−→s )) < cΓ.

Corollary 5.3 bλ,Γ → cΓ, when λ → +∞.
Proof. Using well known arguments, it is possible to prove that cλ,j → cj for
each j ∈ Γ. Therefore, by Proposition 5.2, bλ,Γ → cΓ when λ → +∞.

Since un ∈ Aλn

Γ → 0

Iλn,j(uλn ) → cj,∀j ∈ Γ

Therefore, from of Proposition 4.1,

uλn → u in H 2(R4) with u ∈ H 2

0 (ΩΓ).

Moreover, u is a nontrivial solution of

∆2u + u = f (u), in Ωj

with Ij (u) = cj for all i ∈ Γ. Now, we claim that u = 0 in Ωj, for all j /∈ Γ.
Indeed, it possible to prove that there is σ1 > 0, which is independent of j, such
that if v is a nontrivial solution of (6.45), then

However, the solution u veriﬁes

showing that u = 0 in Ωj, for all j /∈ Γ. This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.1.
