It is shown that two physical phenomena are important for high excitations: (i) the screening of the
universal gluon-exchange potential and (ii) the ﬂattening of the conﬁning potential owing to creation
of quark loops, and both eﬀects are determined quantitatively. Taking the ﬁrst eﬀect into account, we
predict the masses of the ground states with l = 0, 1, 2 in agreement with experiment. The ﬂattening
eﬀect ensures the observed linear behaviour of the radial Regge trajectories M 2(n) = m2
0 + nrµ2
GeV2, where the slope µ2 is very sensitive to the parameter γ, which determines the weakening
of the string tension σ(r) at large distances. For the ρ-trajectory the linear behaviour starts with
nr = 1 and the values µ2 = 1.40(2) GeV2 for γ = 0.40 and µ2 = 1.34(1) GeV2 for γ = 0.45 are
obtained. For the excited states the leptonic widths: Γee(ρ(775)) = 7.0(3) keV, Γee(ρ(1450)) =
1.7(1) keV, Γee(ρ(1900)) = 1.0(1) keV, Γee(ρ(2150)) = 0.7(1) keV, and Γee(1 3D1) = 0.26(5) keV
are calculated, if these states are considered as purely q ¯q states. The width Γee(ρ(1700)) increases
if ρ(1700) is mixed with the 2 3S1 state, giving for a mixing angle θ = 21◦ almost equal widths:
Γee(ρ(1700)) = 0.75(6) keV and Γee(1450) = 1.0(1) keV.

INTRODUCTION

Meson spectroscopy continues to be an important issue both for experimentalists and theoreticians. More precise
experimental data have appeared in the last years [1–9] and a large number of theoretical works are devoted to
light-meson properties [10–20]. The important idea that mesons have universal properties, from light-light to heavy
quarkonia, is supported in many studies [21–28] and a kind of universal q ¯q potential was used for all mesons in diﬀerent
models [9, 10], [12–16], [22–24]. The detailed analysis of meson spectra was done in the relativized potential model
(RPM), introducing a phenomenological (universal) potential [9]. A convenient systematics of radial excitations was
suggested in Ref. [11], where it was assumed that the slope of the radial Regge trajectories (RTs) has a universal
value (with a good accuracy) for all mesons. However, up to now the discussions continue about the true value of
the slopes of the radial RTs [24–27], and even the linearity of the radial RTs is disputed [28]. However, the physical
eﬀects which are responsible for the observed universality remain unclear up to now.

Here we use the relativistic string Hamiltonian (RSH) [12, 13], derived in the framework of the ﬁeld correlator
method [29, 30], which allows for expressing the meson properties via two fundamental parameters: the string tension
and the QCD constant Λ.
In principle, the RSH contains both perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics, and
yields also the spin-dependent interactions, so that, in general, all possible dynamical regimes in the q ¯q systems can
be addressed. It is the main purpose of our work to start a general analysis of the light meson dynamics both in radial
and orbital excitations. However, in the present paper we conﬁne ourselves to the case of the radial excitations of the
vector mesons ρ(nS) and the ground states with l = 0, 1, 2, where the physical picture is more simple and transparent.
Thus, our analysis can be considered as the ﬁrst step towards the overall picture, which may be more complicated.

We show that in light mesons the dynamics is more complicated than in heavy quarkonia, which manifests itself in
two eﬀects: the so-called screening of the gluon-exchange (GE) interaction and the ﬂattening of the linear conﬁning
potential, which is especially important for high excitations. These phenomena occur for extended objects owing to
q ¯q holes (loops), which are created inside the ﬁlm subtended by the Wilson loop. These two eﬀects can be described
by the RSH and will be the main subject of our analysis. As was shown in Ref. [12], the RSH deﬁnes two regimes: the
string regime, valid for the states with large l, l ≥ 3, and the potential-like regime, taking place for low-lying states.
For the ground states (with large l) the mass formula: M 2(l, nr = 0) = 2πσpl(l + 1) was derived, which explicitly

2

shows that the slope of the leading RT is equal to 2πσ = (1.13 ± 0.02) GeV2 with great accuracy (e.g. for l = 3 the
accuracy is 0.8%). To derive this expression it was assumed that in RSH the centrifugal term (the rotation of the
string) gives a large contribution, while the corrections to the mass from the GE, the spin-dependent potentials, and
the self-energy term are considered to be small and may be neglected. However, for low-lying states these terms in
the q ¯q potential are not small [22, 23] and therefore the question arises how to match the mass relations, valid for
the states with large l, and those with l = 0, 1, 2. First, we discuss the well-established features of the universal q ¯q
interaction.

In the RSH approach the q ¯q potential is deﬁned in a gauge-invariant way via the Wilson loop [29, 30] and the
conﬁning potential is shown to be scalar and linear (if no quark loops occur): VC(r) = σ0r, with the string tension
σ0 = 0.18(2) GeV2 ﬁxed by the slope of the leading RT (with j = l+s) [31, 32]. In the static potential, the conﬁning and
GE potentials enter as a sum to satisfy the Casimir scaling, observed on the lattice with very good accuracy [33, 34]. A
very important point is that the parameters of the GE potential cannot be taken arbitrarily but have to be determined
in full correspondence with the existing information from pQCD [35]. From high energy experiments the QCD constant
ΛMS(nf = 5) is now well established, while the QCD constants for nf = 3, 4 are deﬁned by matching the coupling at
the quark mass thresholds [35–37]; it gives the value ΛMS(nf = 3) = (339 ± 10) MeV, if αs(MZ) = 0.1184(7) is used
[35], or a bit smaller ΛMS(nf = 3) = (327 ± 12) MeV is obtained for the new world-average αs(MZ) = 0.1177(13)
[37]. Knowledge of ΛMS(nf = 3) is very important, because its value determines the “vector” constant ΛV (nf = 3),
entering the vector coupling in the GE potential: ΛV(nf = 3) = 1.4753 ΛMS(nf = 3) = (485± 25) MeV [36]. Besides,
as shown recently in Ref. [38], the infrared regulator (IR) MB is not an extra parameter, but can be expressed via
the string tension: M 2
B = 2πσ = 1.13(11) GeV2 (the accuracy of calculations is estimated to be ∼ 10%). Then taking
the central values, ΛV = 0.485 GeV and MB = 1.13 GeV, one deﬁnes the two-loop freezing coupling (called critical),
αcrit = αV(q2 = 0) = 0.6065. Surprisingly, this value of the two-loop αcrit with a large ΛV ∼ 480 MeV coincides
with the one-loop phenomenological αcrit from Ref. [9], where a very small (unrealistic) Λ(nf = 3) = 200 MeV is
used. Knowledge of this freezing constant αcrit = 0.60 ± 0.04 is crucially important for heavy quarkonia, where
the GE interaction remains important up to high excitations. Unfortunately, the role of the GE interaction in light
mesons is not fully understood and here we pay special attention to the correct deﬁnition of the universal potential
to distinguish between true dynamical eﬀects and artifacts coming from diﬀerent ﬁtting parameters, including the
constituent masses. Many features of the light-meson dynamics become more transparent if one studies the S−wave
isovector mesons, which are more simple from the theoretical point of view, since they are not subject to chiral eﬀects
(with exception of the π-meson) and for them there does not exist a complicate centrifugal term in the RSH.

We now pay special attention to the radial RTs with the systematics, suggested in Ref. [11], assuming that the

radial RTs are linear in the (nr, M 2)-plane (J P C is ﬁxed),

M 2(nr) = M 2(nr = 0) + nrµ2.

(1)

Here M (0) is the mass of the lowest-lying meson on the RT and µ2 is the slope parameter. According to Refs. [8, 11]
the slope µ2 is approximately the same for all radial RT trajectories, µ2 = 1.25 ± 0.15 GeV2. This strong statement
cannot be checked in many cases, since no suﬃcient experimental information is available about high radial excitations,
with exception of the ρ family, and in the literature there are also other predictions for µ2 [18, 25], and even the
linear behavior is disputed [28]. The question is whether this slope is universal or not. Notice, that in diﬀerent RPMs
1 = M 2(ρ(1450)) − M 2(ρ(775)) = (1.54 ± 0.04) GeV2 is obtained and
[9, 16, 23] a much larger mass diﬀerence µ2
this value agrees with experimental µ2
1(exp.), if the central values of the mass, M (ρ(775)) and M (ρ′(1450)) from the
1(exp.) = 1.63(2) GeV2 corresponds to the recent
Partical Data Group (PDG) [1] are taken. An even larger value µ2
BaBar data for M (ρ′) = (1493± 15) MeV [5]. In the present paper we will show that this large mass diﬀerence is not
accidental and occurs because the ρ(775) mass is “too small” due to a large GE and self-energy contributions. For
that reason (in contrast to other RTs) the linear behavior of the radial ρ-trajectory starts with the ﬁrst excitation
nr = 1.

Our calculations here are done in closed-channel approximation, neglecting the widths and hadronic shifts, while in
a strict sense light mesons have to be studied as many-channel systems, taking into account a contribution of every
channel to the meson wave function (w.f.). But such many-channel calculations form a very diﬃcult task, which
needs individual consideration of every meson and a complete theory of meson decays, which does not exist now.
Therefore, calculations in closed-channel approximation continue to be very important: they allow for a separation
of the conventional q ¯q mesons from multi-quark systems of a diﬀerent nature [7]. Moreover, the inﬂuence of open
channels can be eﬀectively taken into account, introducing the string tension σ(r) depending on the separation r
[23]. This eﬀect occurs owing to the creation of virtual quark loops in the Wilson loop, causing the string tension to
decrease and depend on r, and this eﬀect is very important for higher radial excitations, while the ground states are
not aﬀected by this ﬂattening eﬀect, since they have relatively small sizes.

An important point is that one can introduce the critical value of the string tension, σcrit, when the breaking of the
q ¯q string takes place. If the string tension is taken as in Ref. [23]: σ(r) = σ0(1 − γf (r)) (with σ0 = 0.18(2) GeV2),

3

then at not too large distances, r ≤ 1.2 fm the string tension is almost constant, σ(r) ≈ σ0, while at larger distances
the function f (r) → 1 and the critical value is

σlim = σ0(1 − γ).

(2)

The calculations show that a good description of the radial excitations is reached if the parameter γ = 0.43 ± 0.03
is used as a ﬁtting parameter. Moreover, the value of γ strongly aﬀects the slope of the radial RT and therefore it
can be extracted from this slope, if there are good experimental data for the mass of the excitations with nr ≥ 2. In
particular, more precise data on the masses of ρ(1900) and ρ(2150) could allow for distinguishing between the value
µ2 = 1.43(13) GeV2, suggested in Ref. [18], and µ2 = 1.365(108) obtained in Refs. [8, 11] from the analysis of the
Crystal Barrel data [2].

Here we also calculate the leptonic widths of the ρ(n 3S1) and ρ(n 3D1) states. However, the accuracy of these
calculations is limited by the fact that they are done in closed-channel approximation, where the norm of the q ¯q
for the states with J P C = 1−− the w.f. can be
component of the w.f. at the origin remains undetermined, e.g.
schematically written as

ψS(r) = Cq ¯q(cos θ ψS(r) − sin θ ψD(r)) + Ccont(S)ψCS,
ψD(r) = Cq ¯q(cos θ ψD(r) + sin θ ψS(r)) + Ccont(D)ψCD,

(3)

assuming that the q ¯q components of the S- and D-wave w.f.s have equal (or close) values and allowing for S−D mixing.
Fortunately, knowledge of the continuum component is not important for the leptonic widths, since a multi-quark
component of the w.f., even if it is large, gives a small contribution to the w.f. at the origin [39]. Thus the weight
C2
q ¯q remains as the relevant unknown parameter in the closed-channel approximation which produces an uncertainty
in the theoretical predictions of the leptonic widths. Here, in our calculations of the leptonic widths of ρ(nS), ρ(nD)
with J P C = 1−− we take Cq ¯q = 1.

II. THE STRING REGIME

In the RSH of light mesons, the quark mass mq = 0 and all spin-dependent potentials are considered as a pertur-

bation; then the RSH is given by the expression [12, 22]:

H(ω, ν) = ω +

(4)

This Hamiltonian contains two variables ω, ν(β), which are deﬁned from the extremum conditions. The variable ν(β)
is shown to be diﬀerent for the states with large l ≥ 3 (in the so-called the string regime) and for small l ≤ 2 (the
potential-like regime) in order to provide the minimal value of the mass [12, 13]. In the string regime the centrifugal
term and the term proportional to σ2r2 dominate and thus the ground state masses Mstr(l, nr = 0) were obtained
neglecting the contributions from the GE and the ﬁne structure potentials. In that approximation the masses of all
members of the multiplet are equal to the centroid mass, which for the ground state (nr = 0) with large l is

M 2

str(l, nr = 0) = 2πσpl(l + 1).

(5)

From this formula one can see that the mass diﬀerence, βl = M 2
str(l), is practically equal to 2πσ =
1.13(1) GeV2 (σ = 0.18(2) GeV2) with high accuracy, e.g. for l = 3 the accuracy is 0.8%. The values of Mstr(l, nr = 0)
are given in Table I together with experimental masses with j = l + s and the centroid masses Mcog(l, nr = 0) for
l = 1, 2.

Table I shows the good agreement between the masses calculated according to Eq. (5), and the experimental masses
for a4(2040), ρ5(2350), a6(2450) [1]. Surprisingly, even for a2 and ρ3 with l = 1, 2 ,the centroid masses have reasonable

4

values, although the low-lying states have to be studied in the potential-like regime and for them all kinds of the
interactions: the conﬁning, the GE, the centrifugal term, are important. In the potential-like regime the RSH can
be rewritten in a more convenient form, H = H0 + ∆(str), where the unperturbed part H0 has the form of the
Hamiltonian occurring in the spinless Salpeter equation (SSE) (mq = 0) [22, 23]:

and the operator p2

r is replaced by p

2, while the remaining part of the centrifugal term, the so-called string correction,

H0 = 2qp2 + m2

q + V0(r),

(6)

∆(str) = −

l(l + 1)σhr−1inl

,

(7)

is considered as a perturbation. This correction is not very large, ∼ 50 − 100 MeV for l = 1, 2, still it cannot be
neglected. In Eq. (7) the variable ω(nl) is the kinetic energy of a light quark, deﬁned by the solutions of the SSE:

(2pp2 + V0(r))ψnl(r) = M0(nl)ψnl(r).

(8)

To deﬁne the solutions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 with l = 0, 1, 2, it is important to use the universal
quark-antiquark potential, which has no ﬁtting parameters and therefore allows to separate physical eﬀects from the
artifacts introduced by ﬁtting parameters. This potential has the form of linear plus GE terms (observed on the
lattice [33] and derived in the ﬁeld correlator method [34]), and successfully describes heavy quarkonia spectra [40],

with σ0 = 0.18(2) GeV2, ﬁxed by the slope of the leading RT. In the GE potential the vector coupling in coordinate
space,

V0(r) = σ0r + VGE(r),

(9)

is taken in two-loop approximation, where it does not depend on the renormalization scheme, and deﬁned via the
vector coupling in momentum space:

deﬁnes the freezing constant, αcrit(q2 = 0) = αV(r → ∞) = 0.60 ± 0.04, which is rather large (for the admissible
values, ΛV = 480 ± 20 MeV and MB = 1.1 − 1.15 GeV ). In bottomonium, this strong GE interaction remains
important up to high excitations and gives a good description of the charmonium and bottomonium spectra [40].
However, for the light mesons this universal potential appears to be too strong, giving smaller masses for the 1S,
1P , and 1D ground states (see Table II). This result does not change if the parameters of the vector coupling vary
within the admissible range.
It also shows that the dynamics in light mesons, which all lie above open hadronic
thresholds, is more complicated due to their large spatial extensions and the appearance of virtual q ¯q loops in the
Wison loop of large size, and hence modifying the gluon exchange propagator. As we shall discuss later in Section V,
the gluon eﬀectively acquires the screening mass due to these loops as obstacles and the color-magnetic conﬁnement
[41]. For that reason we consider also a screened potential.

5

The creation of the virtual quark loops (scalars in the 3P0 mechanism) decreases the string tension, making it
dependent on the separation r. Due to this ﬂattening eﬀect the masses of excited states decrease, e.g. the mass
M (4S) becomes by ∼ 300 − 350 MeV smaller than for a purely linear potential σ0r. However, it is not so for the
ground states with l = 0, 1, 2, which have relatively small sizes (hri ≤ 1.2 fm) and are not aﬀected by the ﬂattening
eﬀect. Below, we shall ﬁnd out the direct connection between the parameter responsible for the ﬂattening of the
potential, and the slope of the radial RT.

There is one more diﬀerence between light meson masses and those of heavy quarkonia, where the centroid masses
just coincide with the eigenvalue (e.v.) of the SSE. For a light meson its centroid mass Mcog(nl) also includes a
negative self-energy contribution ∆(SE) [22, 23, 42] and negative string correction ∆(str) (l = 1, 2), which do not
introduce extra parameters. The self-energy term is very important for the mass value, since it gives contribution to
the intercept of RT. In the case l = 0,

Mcog(nS) = M0(nS) + ∆(SE),

∆(SE) = −

3σ

πω(nl)

.

(14)

In heavy quarkonia ∆(SE) ∼ (1−5) MeV is very small and can be neglected, while for light-light, K, and φ mesons,
∆(SE) is rather large due to the small value of the kinetic energy ω(nl) ∼ (400 − 500) MeV in the denominator.
Because of this term, the squared mass M 2(nl) does not contain a term linear in M (nl)) and provides the linear
behaviour of the RT [10, 23]. Notice, that in the RPM a negative subtractive constant (a ﬁtting parameter), usually
added to the potential (or the mass) [9], violates the linearity of the orbital and radial RT (see also the discussion in
Ref. [15]).

In the mass of the n 3S1 states, M (n 3S1) = M0(nS) + ∆(SE) + 1

4 ∆(HF), the hyperﬁne correction is deﬁned as in

Ref. [43],

∆(HF) =

32παs(µhf )|ψnS(0)|2

9ω2(nS)

,

(15)

where the kinetic energy ω(nS) enters in the denominator. Here it is important to underline that in Eq. (15) the
coupling αs(µhf ) is not an arbitrary parameter. As shown in Ref. [43], this coupling is deﬁned at the universal scale
(for all mesons, light and heavy) µhf ≃ T −1
, where Tg ≃ 0.12 fm is the vacuum correlation length. Since the scale
µhf is close to the mass of the τ -lepton, the value of αs(µhf ) must be close to αs(Mτ ) = 0.33(2) [1]. We take here
αs(µhf ) = 0.31, as it was used in Ref. [44] in the analysis of the hyperﬁne splitting of the B mesons and bottomonium.
In Table II the calculated ρ(nS) masses are given in the typical case, when the universal potential has no screening

in the GE term and the freezing constant αcrit = 0.608, σ0 = 0.18 GeV2.

From Table II one can see (i) that the strong (universal) GE potential gives the ρ(775) mass, as well as the masses
of the M (a2(1318)) = 1.240 GeV, M (ρ3) = 1.59 GeV, smaller by ∼ 80 MeV than their experimental values. (ii) On
the contrary, for high excitations, where the inﬂuence of the GE potential is small, the masses M (3 3S1) and M (4 3S1)
are by ∼ 150 MeV and ∼ 300 MeV larger than in experiment, irrespective of the strength of the GE potential, if
the linear σ0r potential is used. Therefore one needs to look for another eﬀect (reason), responsible for the strong
decrease of the nS masses observed in experiments.

III. THE FLATTENING EFFECT

In Section V we present the physical picture explaining the ﬂattening phenomena, observed on the lattice [45] and
studied in Ref. [23], while here we give concrete results of our calculations with the conﬁning potential, where the
string tension depends on the quark-antiquark separation r,

σ(r) = σ0f (r),

lim
r→∞

σ(r) = σ0(1 − γ).

(16)

6

Here σ0 = 0.18(2) GeV2 and the function f (r) = 1 − γ exp(σ0(r−R0))
B+exp(σ0(r−R0)) , contains three parameters; two of them,
B ∼= 15− 20 and R0 ∼= (1.2− 1.4) fm, are chosen in such way that the ﬂattening slowly starts at rather large distances,
∼ 1.2 fm, while the lowest lying states with l = 0, 1, 2 are not aﬀected by the ﬂattening eﬀect. At large distances,
the string tension goes to the limiting value, σlim = σ0(1 − γ). Direct calculations show that the decrease of the
ρ(nS) (n ≥ 2) masses occur mostly due to the ﬂattening eﬀect and the mass shifts are very sensitive to the value of
the parameter γ in σ(r). To reach agreement with experiment, the ﬁtting parameter γ is to be taken in the narrow
range, γ = (0.43 ± 0.03), however, the values of γ = 0.40 and 0.45 give rise to diﬀerent slopes of the ρ-trajectory.
If γ = 0.40 is taken, then a contribution from the screened GE potential is more important than for γ = 0.45 (see
Table III), but both variants have common features:

1. The linear behavior of the ρ-trajectory starts with nr = 1, although these RTs have slightly diﬀerent slopes: for

γ = 0.40 (0.45) the slope µ2(ρ) = 1.40 (1.35) GeV2.

2. At the same time the mass diﬀerence, µ2

both cases) and agrees with µ2
of the experimental mass are taken. The reason why µ2

1 = M 2(ρ(2S))− M 2(ρ(1S)) = 1.52(4) GeV2 remains relatively large (in
1(exp.) = M 2(ρ(1465)) − M 2(ρ(775)) = (1.55 ± 0.07) GeV2, if the central values

1 is large, is discussed below, in Section IV.

3. The choice of γ directly determines the slope of the radial RT and therefore it could be extracted from the

experimental masses M (ρ(3S)) and M (ρ(4S)), if they would be measured with better accuracy.

In Table III we give the masses in three cases (in all cases σ0 = 0.182 GeV2, mq = 0): in case A there is no screening
of the GE potential, i.e., δ = 0; in the cases B and C the exponential form of the screening, Vscr = VGE exp(−δr) with
the screening parameter δ = 0.20 GeV, is taken. In the cases A and B the other parameters coincide,

ΛV(nf = 3) = 465 MeV, MB = 1.15 GeV, αcrit = 0.5712,
σ0 = 0.182 GeV2, γ = 0.40, B = 20, R0 = 6.0 GeV.

(17)

In case C the stronger GE potential, with αcrit = 0.635, is taken, while γ = 0.45 in the ﬂattening potential is larger
than in Eq. (17). The other parameters in case C are as follows:

ΛV = 500 MeV, MB = 1.15 GeV,
σ0 = 0.182 GeV2, B = 15, R0 = 6.0 GeV2.

(18)

For all nS-states the hyperﬁne correction to the masses is calculated with αs(µhf ) = 0.31.

As seen from Table III, without screening (δ = 0) the ground state masses of ρ(775), a2(1318), and ρ3(1690) appear
to be 50 − 100 MeV smaller than in experiment and variations of the parameters within reasonable ranges do not
change this result. On the contrary, in the case B for the screened GE potential (δ = 0.20 GeV, the other parameters
remaining the same, as in case A) a reasonable agreement with experiment is reached. The choice of δ = 0.30 GeV,
i.e., stronger suppression of the GE potential, gives rise to large masses of ρ(775) and ρ(1465) and was neglected.

The best agreement with experimental data takes place in the case C Eq. (18), when the screening parameter

δ = 0.20 GeV is the same, but ΛV = 500 MeV and γ = 0.45 are larger than in the cases A and B.

Our conclusion is that screening of the universal GE potential is necessary to obtain correct values of the masses of
the lowest lying states with l = 0, 1, 2, otherwise they are ∼ 80 MeV smaller than in experiment. For the higher nS
excitations the contribution from the GE potential cannot be neglected and agreement with experiment is reached
both in the cases B and C. The masses of the nP and nD (nr ≥ 1) states weakly depend on the screened GE potential
and will be discussed in the next Section.
√r2inS of ρ(1S) and ρ(2S), which weakly change in all three cases:

We give here also the radii (r.m.s.) Rs(nS) = h

Rs(1S) = 0.71(0.72) fm in the cases B (C) and a bit smaller, 0.68 fm in the case A, where there is no screening eﬀect.
The r.m.s. of ρ(2S) is signiﬁcantly larger, Rs(2S) = 1.0(1) fm in all cases.

IV. RADIAL REGGE TRAJECTORIES

We have shown that the GE potential gives a small contribution to the masses of the high radial excitations (nr ≥ 1)
and therefore, in ﬁrst approximation, the GE potential with screening can be neglected. This allows to reveal more
explicitly the role of the ﬂattening eﬀect for formation of the radial RT. The most important contribution to the light
meson masses comes from the e.v. of the SSE, Eq. (8), the unperturbed part of the RSH, which in the case of the
linear σ0r potential (σ0 is a constant) is well known. Namely, the e.v. of the SSE (mq = 0) can be approximated with
great accuracy (for nr ≥ 1) by the expression [16, 23],

a) Here the hyperﬁne contribution ∼ 65 MeV is taken into account.

This formula explicitly shows that the e.v.s M 2
0 (nr = 0, l) for the ground states for given l, lie on the orbital RT with
the slope β0 = 8σ0 = 1.44 GeV2, which is ≈ 27% larger than β(exp.) = 2πσ0 = 1.13(1) GeV2, observed in experiment.
For the radial excitations, the diﬀerence between the slope in Eq. (19) and the one found in experiment is very large:
0 = 4πσ0 = 2.26 GeV2 is 1.6− 2.0 times larger than µ2(exp.) = (1.25± 0.15) GeV2 [8, 11]. The question is why such
µ2
a large diﬀerence occurs.
First of all, we look at the contribution to the centroid mass from the self-energy correction, Eq. (14), for which we

use the relation, M0(nS) = 4ω0(nS) (valid for σ = const.) and rewrite ∆(SE) = − 12σ0

πM0

; then

Mcog(nS) = M0(nS) −

3.82σ0
M0(nS)

.

(20)

In the squared mass we neglect the small squared self-energy term (although it is not small for the 1S state) and
obtain

M 2

cog(nS) = M 2

0 (nS) − 7.6σ0 = σ0(4πnr − 7.6 + 3π) = (0.33 + 2.26nr) GeV2.

(21)

From here one can see that owing to ∆(SE) the value of M 2
0 given in Eq. (19), while the slope
0 = 4πσ0 = 2.26(2) GeV2 does not change. Thus we have conﬁrmed the well-known result that the purely linear
µ2
potential with σ = const. produces always a large slope of the radial RT.

cog is smaller than M 2

The situation strongly changes, if the ﬂattening potential VC(r) = σ(r)r is considered, for which the representation
Eq. (19) is not valid anymore (in this case the e.v. of the SSE will be denoted as ˜M0(nS)). Our calculations show
that

1. The linear behavior of the ρ RT starts with nr = 1, because for the ﬂattening potential (with γ = 0.40 or 0.45)
1 ∼ 1.87(5) GeV2, being still 20% smaller than

1 = ˜M 2(2S) − ˜M 2(1S) remains large, µ2

the mass diﬀerence µ2
µ2
1 = 4πσ0 in Eq. (19).

2. For the nP and nD states the linear behaviour starts with nr = 0.

3. The slope µ2(l) strongly depends on the parameter γ in σ(r) , Eq. (16), which characterizes the weakening of

the conﬁning potential.

The squared e.v., ˜M 2

0 (nS) (in GeV2) (nr ≥ 1), with γ = 0.40, 0.45, 0.50 can be approximated as

˜M 2
˜M 2
˜M 2

0 = (2.42 + 1.40 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.40,
0 = (2.31 + 1.27 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.45,
0 = (2.25 + 1.15 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.50.

(22)

The accuracy of these expressions is ∼ 1%.

8

From Eq. (22) the important result follows that for the ﬂattening potential the squared e.v.s of the SSE have a
much smaller slope (two times smaller for γ = 0.50), than in the case of the purely linear potential Eq. (19), which
decreases for larger values of γ, i.e., a stronger ﬂattening eﬀect. For the centroid mass the intercept is changed, while
the value of the slope is the same, so that the ρ trajectory (nr ≥ 1) is,

M 2

cog(ρ) = (0.77 + 1.40 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.40,
cog = (0.80 + 1.27 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.45,
M 2
cog = (0.90 + 1.15 nr) GeV2, for γ = 0.50.
M 2

(23)

In all cases Mcog(ρ(1450)) = (1.44 − 1.47) GeV. However, if the exponential screening of VGE and the hyperﬁne
interaction are taken into account, then the slope increases while the intercept does practically not change. In the
cases A and C (see the parameters of the GE potential in Eqs. (17,18)) and for nr ≥ 1 we have

M 2(n 3S1) = (0.78 + 1.40(2) nr) GeV2 (γ = 0.40),
M 2(n 3S1) = (0.81 + 1.34(1) nr) GeV2 (γ = 0.45).

(24)

Thus for γ = 0.45 the calculated ρ-trajectory has µ2 = 1.34(1) GeV2, in agreement with the results in Refs. [11, 26],
where µ2 = 1.365(108) GeV2 was obtained from the analysis of the Crystal Barrel data [2]. On the contrary, the
larger µ2 = 1.40(2) GeV2 for γ = 0.40 agrees with the slope, µ2 = 1.43(13) GeV2, predicted in Ref.
[27]. Notice,
that for γ = 0.45 a better agreement is obtained for the ρ(1450) mass (see Table III).

In the same way, the radial RTs for the nP and nD states were considered; it appears that for l = 1, 2 the linear

behavior of the radial RT starts with nr = 0 and the squared e.v. of SSE M 2

0 (nP ) can be approximated as

Then, taking into account the self-energy and string corrections we obtain for the centroid masses,

˜M 2

0 (nP ) = (3.11 + 1.25 nr) GeV2 (γ = 0.45).

M 2

cog(nP ) = (1.64(2) + 1.25 nr) GeV2.

(25)

(26)

From this expression one can obtain the aj radial RT, taking into account the ﬁne-structure splitting, which does
practically not change the slope, but introduces a ﬁtting parameter. For that reason we restrict ourselves to the RTs
for the centroid masses. Notice that µ2(nP ) = 1.25 GeV2 practically coincides with the slope for the centroid masses
of the nS states, if γ = 0.45.

For the nD trajectory the e.v.s of the SSE have a smaller slope (nr ≥ 0),

˜M 2

0 (nD) = (4.36 + 1.11(5) nr) GeV2 (γ = 0.45).

and

M 2

cog(nD) = (2.8(1) + 1.11(5) nr) GeV2(γ = 0.45).

(27)

(28)

Now we brieﬂy discuss the reasons why the mass diﬀerence µ2

Notice, that the slope µ2(l) decreases for increasing angular-momentum l. At this point it is important to stress that
for physical nD states the GE contribution is much smaller than that for the nS states, and therefore for the ρ3,
ρ2, and ρ(n 3D1) trajectories the slopes have to be close to the one given in Eq. (28), where µ2(D) = 1.11(5) GeV2,
if the ﬁne-structure eﬀects are neglected. Our result is in agreement with µ2(a2) = 1.00(6) GeV2 and µ2(a1) =
(1.084 ± 0.63) GeV2, predicted for the a1 and a2 RTs from the analysis of experimental data in Ref. [26].
1 = M 2(2S) − M 2(1S), is large. The ﬁrst reason is
that this factor is very large for the ﬂattening potential (without GE interaction), where µ2
1 = 1.87(5) GeV2 for the
squared e.v. of SSE. This result does not change, if a reasonable choice of the parameters in σ(r) is made. Secondly,
if the GE interaction is taken into account, then for the 1S state, localized at rather small distances, the self-energy
1 = 1.56(6) GeV2. This
and hyperﬁne corrections decrease the mass diﬀerence µ2
1(exp.) = 1.55(7) GeV2 [1], if the central values
number appears to be very close to what is observed in experiment, µ2
of the ρ(775) and ρ(1465) masses are used. Just for that reason, the linear behaviour of the ρ RT begins with nr = 1,
while other radial RTs start with nr = 0.

V. FLATTENING PHENOMENON - THE PHYSICAL PICTURE

The dynamics of light mesons is more complicated than that in heavy quarkonia, since light mesons, as rather
extended objects, are sensitive to detailed properties of the conﬁnement mechanism, which also aﬀects the gluon

exchanges. Our approach is based on the background perturbation theory (BPT) [46], which takes into account the
non-perturbative background with conﬁnement and does not contain unphysical singularities (the Landau ghost poles
and IR renormalons), present in standard perturbation theory. Below, we illustrate how the BPT predicts three
eﬀects, which are observed in experiment and especially important for light mesons:

9

1. Stabilisation of the coupling αs(q2) at q2 → 0, α(0) ≡ αcrit;
2. Screening of αs at large distances;

3. Flattening of the string tension at large distances, σ → σ(r).

β0t0 (cid:16)1 − β1

β 2

t0 (cid:17), where t0 = ln( M 2

B

Item 1. The basic feature of BPT is the gauge-invariant treatment of conﬁnement and gluon-exchanges, when both
phenomena occur owing to the Wilson loop, where conﬁnement creates the minimal-area surface (the so-called conﬁn-
ing ﬁlm) and the gluon-exchange trajectories are necessarily present inside this surface. As a result, the gluon loops,
appearing on these trajectories and responsible for asymptotic freedom, create open loops in the conﬁning ﬁlm, and
this eﬀect strengthens with increasing αs, leading ﬁnally to the saturation of αs(q2) which in two-loop approximation
is given by αcrit = 4π

Λ2 ) and with 10% accuracy M 2

B = 2πσ [41].

ln t0

Item 2. For the same reason, the scalar q ¯q loops, appearing in the ﬁlm (of large size), lead to the screening of the
GE interaction, since any gluon trajectory, propagating inside the conﬁning ﬁlm, is interrupted by the scalar loops and
those create an eﬀective mass of the gluon. In addition, there is a diﬀerence between the free propagation (free Green’s
function of the gluon) and the gluon propagation inside the surface with conﬁnement. This complicated phenomenon
was studied in Ref. [47] for zero temperature and in Ref. [48] for the deconﬁned phase, where it occurs due to the
color-magnetic conﬁnement. This eﬀect at zero temperature, when both color-electric and color-magnetic conﬁnement
collaborate, is not yet ﬁnally settled and therefore in our paper we exploit the eﬀective screening parameter δ for the
screening mass. Our analysis has shown that for the exponential form of screening δ = 0.20 GeV is the preferable
value, while suppression of the GE potential is too strong for δ = 0.30(0.10) GeV.

Item 3. For excited light mesons, conﬁnement occurs in a highly excited string, when the Wilson loop has a free

boundary and several typical features, partly discussed above. Namely, there exist

(i) a ﬁnite density of the q ¯q loops in the conﬁning ﬁlm, which leads to the dependence of the string tension on r,

(ii) a possibility to decay, virtually or really, into a pair (or several) mesons, so that if the distance r in the conﬁning

σ → σ(r);
potential σr exceeds the separation, Rf ∼ 2rπ ≃ 1.2 fm, then the ﬂattening of the potential is expected.
The ﬁrst feature can also be seen in the T -dependence of σ(r): when the density of the q ¯q loops grows with
increasing temperature T , then the potential V (r, T ) becomes more and more ﬂat, as it was observed on the lattice
[49]. Another manifestation of the ﬂattening phenomenon was recently studied in Ref. [50]: while applying a magnetic
ﬁeld parallel to the conﬁning ﬁlm, it was observed that the density of the q ¯q loops increases and the string tension
σ(r) ﬂattens, in agreement with the lattice data [51].

in the form of the string tension, Eq. (16), which is used in our paper.

Both features, ﬂattening due to a ﬁnite q ¯q density and the existence of the critical length Rf ∼ 2rπ are embodied
√r2inS, calculated for the sets of the parameters
In conclusion we give the r.m.s of the ρ(nS) mesons, rs = h

Eqs. (17, 18): for ρ(775), rs(1S) = (0.71 − 0.73) fm and for ρ(1450), rs = (0.9 − 1.0) fm.

VI. THE LEPTONIC WIDTHS OF ρ(n 3S1) l = 0, 2

The decay constants fV and leptonic widths of the ρ(n 3S1) mesons are calculated here, considering them as purely
q ¯q states, i.e., taking Cq ¯q = 1.0 in the w.f. given in Eq. (3). For the decay constant in the vector channel fV we use the
expression from Ref. [52], where the correlator of the currents (in diﬀerent channels) is derived using the functional
integral representation and on the ﬁnal stage expanding this correlator in the complete set of eigenfunctions of the
RSH H0, Eq. (6). This gives

which for the ground and excited states are almost equal, ξ(1S) = 0.70(1) and ξ(nS) = 0.72(1), (n = 2, 3, 4), if
the static potential with the parameters Eqs. (17,18) is used (for the ρ-mesons the average ¯e2
q = 1/2). The factor
βQCD = 1 − 16
3π αs = 0.40 takes into account the radiative corrections [53] and here we use for all (n 3S1)-states the
same coupling αs(µs) = 0.353 (at the scale µs ∼ 1.0 GeV). If the conﬁning potential ﬂattens at large distances, then
the w.f.s at the origin RnS(0) ∼ (0.36 − 0.33) GeV3/2 (n = 2 − 4) have close values , while for the ground state the
w.f. R1S(0) = (0.376 ± 0.008) GeV3/2 is larger, and for the ρ(775) the decay constant and leptonic width are

fV = (245 ± 6) MeV,
where the uncertainty comes from that in the w.f. at the origin, and

Γee(ρ(775)) = (7.0 ± 0.3) keV.

(32)

(33)

To calculate the leptonic widths of the higher ρ(nS), it is convenient to use the ratio of the leptonic widths,

Γee(n 3S1)/Γee(ρ(775)), where the factors ξ(nS) and βQCD drop out. This gives

Γee(2 3S1) = 0.24 Γee(ρ(775)) = 1.7(1) keV,
Γee(3 3S1) = 0.14 Γee(ρ(775)) = 1.0(1) keV,
Γee(4 3S1) = 0.096 Γee(ρ(775)) = 0.7(1) keV,

(34)

where the uncertainties come from the experimental errors in the ρ(nS) masses and the w.f.s at the origin. Notice
that in a realistic situation the leptonic widths of the excited ρ(nS) mesons may be smaller, if the q ¯q component Cq ¯q
in their w.f.s is less than 1.0.

The leptonic widths of the (n 3D1)-states is calculated deﬁning their w.f.s at the origin via the second derivative,
according to the prescription from Ref. [54]: RnD(0) = 5R′′(0)
, where R′′1D(0) = 0.026(1) GeV7/2 and ω(1D) =
2√2ω2
0.536 GeV. It gives R1D(0) = 0.163(3) GeV3/2, which is not very small due to the small value of the kinetic energy
ωnD ∼ 0.5 GeV. The other parameters are ξ(1D) = 0.69, βQCD = 0.40, M (1 3D1) = 1.72(2) GeV, so that the leptonic
width,

nD

Γee(1 3D1) = 0.26(5) keV

(35)

is rather small. However, its value may increase owing to the 2S − 1D mixing, and for a mixing angle θ = 21◦ the
leptonic widths of ρ(1450) and ρ(1700) become almost equal:

Γee(ρ(1450)) = 1.0(1) keV, Γee(ρ(1700)) = 0.75(6) keV (θ = 21◦).

(36)

Here it was assumed that in the w.f.s of ρ(1450) and ρ(1700) the q ¯q components are equal.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the light meson properties with the use of the RSH, which allows us to investigate the light-meson
dynamics without introducing ﬁtting parameters. It appears that the universal static potential, successfully applied
to heavy quarkonia, gives rise to small masses of the lowest states with l = 0, 1, 2 and at the same time large masses
of the excited states. To explain the physical spectrum, two eﬀects: the screening of the GE interaction and the
ﬂattening of the conﬁning potential, which appear owing to quark-loop creation, are to be taken into account. We
have demonstrated the following properties.

1. The screening of the GE potential, taken as an exponential function with the screening parameter δ = 0.20 GeV,

gives the masses of the lowest lying states for each l in agreement with experiment.

2. The slope of the radial RT is very sensitive to the value of the parameter γ, which determines the ﬂattening
of the string tension σ(r): at large distances σ(r) → σ0(1 − γ). The parameter γ could be extracted from the
experimental masses of ρ(1900) and ρ(2150), if these were measured with better accuracy, while now it is taken
from the range γ = 0.43 ± 0.03.

11

3. From our calculations two values for the slope of the ρ-trajectory are obtained, µ2(ρ) = 1.40(2) GeV2 for

γ = 0.40 and µ2(ρ) = 1.34(1) GeV2 for γ = 0.45, neither result contradicts the existing experimental data.

4. The linear behaviour of the radial RT starts with nr = 0 for the nP and nD trajectories, while the linear
behaviour of the ρ trajectory begins with the ﬁrst excitation, nr = 1, since the large value of the mass diﬀerence,
M 2(ρ(1450)) − M 2(ρ(775)) = 1.56(6)GeV2 (or the relatively small value of the ρ(775) mass) is a dynamical
property of the 1S ground state.

5. The leptonic widths Γee(ρ(775)) = 7.0(3) keV, Γee(ρ(1450)) = 1.7(1) keV, Γee(ρ(1900)) = 1.0(1) keV,
Γee(2150)) = 0.7(1) keV, and Γee(ρ(1700)) = 0.26(5) keV are calculated considering them as purely q ¯q states.
If 2S − 1D mixing is possible, then for the mixing angle θ = 21◦ comparable values of the leptonic widths
Γee(ρ(1450)) = 1.0(1) keV and Γ(ρ(1700) = 0.75(6) keV are obtained.
