Abstract

Nonsingular disclination dynamics in a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is modeled within
a mathematical framework where the kinematics is a direct extension of the classical
way of identifying these line defects with singularities of a unit vector ﬁeld represent-
ing the nematic director. It is well known that the universally accepted Oseen-Frank
energy is inﬁnite for conﬁgurations that contain disclination line defects. We devise
a natural augmentation of the Oseen-Frank energy to account for physical situations
where, under certain conditions, inﬁnite director gradients have zero associated energy
cost, as would be necessary for modeling half-integer strength disclinations within the
framework of the director theory. Equilibria and dynamics (in the absence of ﬂow) of
line defects are studied within the proposed model. Using appropriate initial/boundary
data, the gradient-ﬂow dynamics of this energy leads to non-singular, line defect equi-
librium solutions, including those of half-integer strength. However, we demonstrate
that the gradient ﬂow dynamics for this energy is not able to adequately describe de-
fect evolution. Motivated by similarity with dislocation dynamics in solids, a novel
2D-model of disclination dynamics in nematics is proposed. The model is based on the
extended Oseen-Frank energy and takes into account thermodynamics and the kine-
matics of conservation of defect topological charge. We validate this model through
computations of disclination equilibria, annihilation, repulsion, and splitting. We show
that the energy function we devise, suitably interpreted, can serve as well for the
modeling of equilibria and dynamics of dislocation line defects in solids making the
conclusions of this paper relevant to mechanics of both solids and liquid crystals.

Introduction

Liquid crystals (LC) are matter in a state whose properties are between liquids and solids.
Research on liquid crystals is currently advancing quite rapidly motivated by applications
and discoveries in material science as well as in biological systems. There are many types

1

of liquid crystal states, depending on the amount of order in the material. A nematic phase
consists of rod like molecules that retain some long-range orientational order. In this work,
we are primarily interested in modeling disclinations in a uniaxial nematic liquid crystalline
medium, treated by an augmentation of the classical model (cf. [1]) where the director order
parameter is represented by a unit vector ﬁeld.

The classical theories of liquid crystal mechanics like the Oseen-Frank and Ericksen-Leslie
models predict unbounded energy in ﬁnite bodies with discrete disclinations. Recently, a
kinematic augmentation of classical Leslie-Ericksen theory [2, 3] has been devised that al-
lows alleviating the singularity, with results being demonstrated for the case where the defect
ﬁeld is not allowed to evolve. These works aim to achieve an understanding of the connec-
tions between the classical theory of defects, such as solid dislocations and disclinations
introduced by Weingarten and Volterra, and the theory of defected liquid crystals, a line
of enquiry that began from the work of Kleman [4]. In [2], the model introduces an aug-
mented Oseen-Frank kinematics and involves a director ﬁeld and an incompatible director
distortion ﬁeld that is not curl-free. In [3], a ﬁnite element based numerical scheme was used
to solve for the director ﬁelds of prescribed static disclinations and a critical examination
presented of the similarities and diﬀerences that arise between the modeling of LC discli-
nations and solid dislocations using the eigendeformation approach [3]. In this paper, we
study this augmented model with natural constitutive modiﬁcations to enable the study of
equilibria and evolution of LC disclinations, including those of half integer strength. First, a
gradient ﬂow dynamics of the augmented energy is utilized and used to calculate equilibrium
solutions. However, we ﬁnd that the gradient ﬂow dynamics for this energy is not suitable
for modeling the defect evolution problem, and explain why this must be so. Motivated by
the crystal dislocation case, a 2D model based on the augmented energy, thermodynamics,
and the kinematics of conservation of defect topological charge is constructed to analyze ne-
matic disclination dynamics. We validate this model through computations for disclination
equilibria, annihilation, repulsion, and dissociation.

Non-singular equilibria and dynamics of liquid crystal point and line defects have been
studied in the literature, particularly within the Landau de-Gennes (L-dG) framework [5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. A more limited
number of studies have been carried out in the Oseen-Frank and Leslie-Ericksen models as
well as Ericksen’s model for nematics with variable degree of orientation [27, 18, 19, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. The general consensus from the literature is that ﬁnite energy
line-defects, including those of half-integer strength, can only be predicted by the full L-dG
theory among all the models mentioned above.

As a point of departure, Ball and Bedford [38] suggest the use of discontinuous order
parameter ﬁelds, in particular a discontinuous vector order parameter ﬁeld to represent uni-
axial nematics. The exploration there is essentially kinematical and focuses primarily on
the appropriate mathematical function spaces to be used, stopping short of demonstrating
speciﬁc examples of solutions (or approximations thereof) of defect equilibria resulting from
the use of energy functions and dynamical models based on their discontinuous kinemat-
ics. Our work, in essence, achieves precisely this goal, thus being complementary to [38].
While our computational work does not employ discontinuous ﬁelds, it is demonstrated and
explained why our approach yields, in a sense, the natural practical approximation of such
discontinuous limiting director ﬁelds.

The work of Gartland [39] demonstrates how the classical Oseen-Frank energy may be
viewed as a constrained form of the Landau-deGennes energy at temperatures below the
‘supercooling temperature.’ Since in this temperature range the bulk Landau-deGennes
energy is minimized by Q-tensors representing the uniaxial nematic phase, the constrained
L-dG energy of nematic conﬁgurations that contain line defects is inﬁnite. Our work develops
a modiﬁcation of the Oseen-Frank energy that enables the prediction of ﬁnite-energy defect
ﬁelds, utilizing a core energy regularization that involves a material length scale which may
be associated with the ‘nematic correlation length’ ξ as deﬁned in [39].

2 Notation

The condition that a is deﬁned to be b is indicated by the statement a := b. The Einstein
summation convention is implied unless speciﬁed otherwise. The symbol Ab denotes the
action of a tensor A on a vector b, producing a vector. In the sequel, a · b represents the
inner product of two vectors a and b; the symbol AD represents tensor multiplication of
the second-order tensors A and D.

The symbol div represents the divergence and grad represents the gradient. In this paper
all tensor or vector indices are written with respect to the basis ei, i=1 to 3, of a rectangular
Cartesian coordinate system. The following component-form notation holds:

(A × v)im = emjkAijvk
(div A)i = Aij,j

(curl A)im = emjkAik,j
where emjk is a component of the alternating tensor X.

The following list describes some of the mathematical symbols we use in this work:
n: director
k: disclination strength
θ: angle of director ﬁeld
λ: layer ﬁeld
l: layer thickness
ξ: core width

3 Augmented Oseen-Frank energy and corresponding

gradient ﬂow computations

It is generally believed that a theory of nematic line defects cannot be established with a
representation of the nematic director by a unit vector ﬁeld.
Indeed, consider a nematic
occupying a two-dimensional domain with the director ﬁeld n taking values in S1. Assuming
the validity of the universally accepted Oseen-Frank energy density function [27, 40] given
by

FOF = K1(div n)2 + K2(n · curl n)2 + K3|n × curl n|2

+K24(div n)2 − tr(grad n)2)

3

where K1, K2, K3, K24 are material dependent Frank elastic constants, it can be seen that the
planar conﬁguration of a straight, half-integer strength wedge disclination necessarily results
in at least one curve C in the plane connecting the core of the defect to the external boundary
such that the vector ﬁeld n has to be discontinuous along C. If the discontinuity were to
be approximated by a thin region along C characterized by high gradients of the director,
the Oseen-Frank energy of the resulting conﬁguration would yield a physically unobserved
region of very high energy density. One of our goals in this paper is to propose a model that
adequately resolves this problem by augmenting the director model by an additional ﬁeld.
The resulting model is diﬀerent from the Landau De-Gennes Q-tensor model [7], and makes
close connections to models of line defects in other ﬁelds, such as crystal plasticity and phase
transitions in solids.

The Oseen-Frank energy function is a quadratic function in the director ﬁeld1 and its
gradients. With the half-integer defect as a motivation, it would seem that if director dis-
continuity associated with the winding of the director by π radians were to be assigned a
vanishing energy cost, then progress may be made on modeling line defects. Mathematically,
suppose that the director n winds by π radians over the distance l in the direction of a unit
vector p, where l is a parameter with physical dimensions of length. Associating a zero
energy cost to the jump of the director by π radians across the line perpendicular to p can
be stated as a condition

as l → 0+. This is equivalent to demanding a zero energy cost for a ﬂip of π radians over a
layer of width l in the limit of vanishing layer width. The second equlity in (1) stems from
the condition

FOF (n, grad n) = FOF (−n,− grad n)

arising from the head-tail symmetry of the nematic molecules2. As illustration, these re-
quirements mean there is no energy in the case shown in Figure 1(a) which is physically
equivalent to Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c). For ﬁxed n, this implies a multiple-well structure
of the energy density in the director gradient slot of F.

1From here onwards, we will use the imprecise short-form of ‘director ﬁeld’ to refer to the ‘director vector

ﬁeld.’

2Of course, the choice of a ﬂip by π radians in (1) is also intimately connected to head-tail symmetry of

the nematic molecules.

Figure 2 shows another justiﬁcation for demanding nonconvexity of the energy-density. It
shows two spatial points in the nematic liquid crystal located close to each other, represented
as the red dots (point 1 and point 2 ). The director at point 1 is assumed be in the
horizontal direction pointing to the right, shown as the black line. At point 2 , the director
is considered as a vector originating from this point 2 and rotates clockwise. The angle
between the director at point 1 and the director at point 2 is denoted as θ. First, θ will
increase from 0◦ to 90◦, represented as the blue angle in Figure 2, and the angle α used to
identify the angular separation and gradient for calculation of the the energy density equals θ,
which causes the energy density to increase. When the director rotation passes 90◦, although
the angle θ between the two directors keeps increasing, the angle α used to calculate the
energy density is π − θ (the orange angle in Figure 2) since physically the director has no
direction. Thus, when θ increases from 90◦ to 180◦ the energy density decreases. In addition,
the energy density will reach its maximum when the angle θ reaches 90◦.

High director gradients, uniform along layers, and with little energy cost from such layers
may be expected in models with the above nonconvexity in the energy density. However, a
state with a single disclination is the limit, as the layer width goes to zero, of a continuous,
global director conﬁguration that has a high, uniform director gradient in a section of a thin
layer, transitioning to gradients of negligible magnitude in the rest of the layer (the parts of
the layer −l/2 < y < l/2 to the right and to the left of x = 0, respectively, in Figure 3(e).
Here 0 < l (cid:28) 1.). The transition region in the layer is the core of the disclination. Since the
director conﬁguration varies continuously, from its value on the top of the section of the layer
with non-negligible gradient to its value at the bottom (of the same section of the layer) along
any path going around the core, it is easy to see that such a global conﬁguration has to contain
substantial total energy on the whole (see Figure 3(e)). Since it is physically reasonable to
expect such director conﬁgurations to exist without imposed loadings, it is clear that the
attainment of such states cannot be a question of global energy minimization, and almost
deﬁnitely not in a model whose energy density is quadratic in the director gradients (as
for example in the 1-constant Oseen-Frank energy density approximation in Leslie-Ericksen
theory). It is also believed that disclination cores move under their mutual interaction, even
in the absence of applied loads, with speeds unrelated to causes of orientational or positional
inertia of the material. Indeed, the Ericksen-Leslie equations governing the director ﬁeld are
most often used without any orientational inertia. Moreover, it seems reasonable to develop
models where motion of defects are allowed even in the absence of ﬂow; as justiﬁcation we
quote the following excerpt from Ericksen [41], discussing parallel, straight disclinations:

“Saupe is very familiar with observations of disclinations of this kind, his own and those
made by others. Typically, they are observed in specimens contained between a cover plate
and a glass slide, in a polarizing microscope. Generally, they do move, but not alway[s]
rapidly. There are empirical rules, of a topological nature, for determining the kinds that
attract (or repel) each other, such as were discussed by Friedel [12], for example. As they
move, they cause little or no ﬂow; experimentalists tell me that it is hard to detect any so

caused, although, they don’t doubt that, in principle, there is some.3 Dynamical theory does
involve viscous contributions, modifying the constitutive equations, etc., associated with the
time rate of change of the director as well as the velocity ﬁeld. From what I know of the
theory and observations, I don’t believe that one can use equilibrium theory to analyze these
phenomena....”

Based on the above observations, it appears to us that accommodating general disclina-
tion dynamics, including that of half-integer strength disclinations, within the structure of
Leslie-Ericksen theory or Ericksen [42] is probably an unattainable goal. Thus, we augment
the kinematics (and dynamical structure) of Leslie-Ericksen theory with an additional ﬁeld
that allows for equilibria and motion of non-singular disclinations, as described below.

We follow the primarily kinematical ideas presented in [3] and restrict attention to the pla-
nar case. We assume that the director n is a unit vector which therefore can be parametrized
with an angle ﬁeld, i.e., n = cos θe1 + sin θe2. As in [3] we introduce a layer ﬁeld λ. Fur-
thermore, we assume that the energy E, depending on the ﬁelds grad θ and λ, takes the
form

Here K > 0 is a constant parameter representing 1-constant Oseen-Frank elasticity. The
parameter  := KCaξ2 depends on the disclination core width ξ > 0, a fundamental length
scale of the model, a non-dimensional parameter C to control the magnitude of the core
energy, and the width of the layer l = aξ, where a ≥ 0 is a non-dimensional scaling factor.
To allow for conventional expectations, we will accommodate the limit a → 0 and still allow
for ﬁnite energy disclination solutions (recall that ξ > 0). The parameter γ is deﬁned as
γ := 2P Kˆk
2. f is a multi-
well function with minima of wells at integer multiples of 2πˆk
aξ . A typical candidate for the
function f that we use in this work is

The intuition behind why the energy (2) can serve to represent disclinations is as follows.
For a ﬁxed speciﬁcation of the ﬁeld λ very similar to as speciﬁed in (6), it is shown in detail
in [3] that the director and energy density ﬁelds of disclination defects are well captured
by a model whose static governing equation is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the energy
(2) for variations only in the ﬁeld θ. All that then remains to be convinced of is that the
conﬁguration of λ speciﬁed in (6) is close to one that extremizes the energy (2), with the
associated θ ﬁeld being the solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation of (2) for θ-variations
(i.e. the right-hand-side of (5)1). This is easy to see as the magnitude of the λ ﬁeld in
(6) does lie in the wells of the function f . The term penalizing curl λ in (2) smooths out

the transition of λ within the layer, as does the elastic energy term (the ﬁrst term of the
√
integrand in (2)4). This transition layer in curl λ within the layer signiﬁes the core region
of a disclination, and the parameter  characterizes the core energy of the defect, with

roughly setting the core-width in the equilibrium solution. It is to be noted that the core
energy (i.e the second term in the integrand in (2)) does not penalize the vertical gradients
of the λ ﬁeld in (6) across the horizontal boundaries of the layer.

Also, we assume M1 = M2ξ2; this is justiﬁed by the fact that we view the gradient ﬂow
equation for θ as simply a device to achieve equilibrium in θ with λ ﬁxed. Indeed, in all
gradient-ﬂow results presented in the following, we have checked our results to ensure that
they are invariant to solving directly for the equilibrium of θ for ﬁxed λ. Then the non-

In all that follows, we think of our computational solutions employing a > 0 as ap-
proximations of the limiting case a = 0 which assigns no physical signiﬁcance to the layer.
In Section 4.5 we show that our equilibrium disclination solutions show a trend to ﬁnite
total energy even in that limit. Thus, the nondimensionalized model eﬀectively has two
non-dimensional constants, C, P .

4 Static results from gradient ﬂow

We evaluate the gradient ﬂow model by presenting results for straight wedge disclinations.
All calculations are done on a square domain of non-dimensional extent L × L with L = 50.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we assume a = 1, C = 1 and P = 20.
We compute results for four cases in this section, namely strength half disclinations
(k = ±0.5) and strength one disclinations (k = ±1). The initial condition for the layer ﬁeld

2 disclination

For a positive half disclination, k = 0.5, the director rotates π radians clockwise while travers-
ing a loop clockwise from the bottom of the layer to the top, starting from an orientation of
θ = π with respect to the positive x-axis at the bottom of the layer. The initial prescription
of the λ ﬁeld is shown in Figure 3(a). λ2 is the only non-zero component inside the layer
and thus the director distortion ﬁeld is not curl-free at the disclination core where the layer

terminates. Figure 3(b), 3(d) and 3(e) are computational equilibria obtained from the gra-
dient ﬂow evolution from the initial conditions described in (7). Equilibrium is considered
achieved if the magnitudes of the ‘rates’ of evolution become less than 10−4 for both θ and
λ on the entire domain. The director ﬁeld over the whole body is represented with dashed
line ﬁeld in Figure 3(d). A magniﬁed view of the core area is shown in Figure 3(e).In this
paper, the spacing of the dashed curves do not represent spacing of the computational mesh.
Figure 3(b) shows the energy density distribution for this case. The energy is concentrated
in the core and the location of the layer is energetically ‘invisible’.

4.2 Strength − 1
For the negative half disclination k = −0.5, the director rotates π radians anticlockwise
while traversing a loop clockwise from the bottom of the layer to the top, starting from a
θ = π orientation with respect to the positive x-axis at the bottom of the layer. Figure 5(a)
shows the initial condition on the λ ﬁeld for this case. The prescribed value of λ inside the

Now consider k = ±1, which implies a director rotation of 2π radians across the layer.
Following the deﬁnition of λ, we can prescribe λ ﬁelds for one disclination as well. Figure 6
presents the equilibrated director results of ±1 disclinations. Since strength ±1 disclinations

4.5 Variation of total energy as a function of layer thickness

For nematic disclinations, a layer where the director vector ‘unwinds’ is to be considered as
an approximation to the physical case of a sharp discontinuity in the director vector ﬁeld.
Thus it is necessary to demonstrate, at least approximately, that in the limit a → 0 the total
energy of the body with a disclination remains non-zero but ﬁnite.

Recall the nondimensionalized energy in this work takes the form

4.6 Shortcoming of the gradient ﬂow dynamics for this energy

function

In spite of the fact that the gradient ﬂow method for this energy works very well in the
computation of defect equilibria as demonstrated in Sections 4.1 - 4.3, it is not able to predict
the motion of disclinations. To illustrate this point, we consider disclination annihilation as
an example. Figure 11(a) shows the corresponding initial |λ| ﬁeld, i.e., a half disclination
dipole is prescribed within the layer as initial condition. Figure 11(b) shows the initialization
of the θ ﬁeld, where the red dot represents a strength +1/2 disclination and the green dot
represents a strength −1/2 disclination core.

Figure 11: Director ﬁeld and energy density plot for disclination annihilation using the
gradient ﬂow method. The two white lines are artiﬁcially inserted to display the top and
bottom layer boundaries. The results from the gradient ﬂow calculation do not match
physical expectation.

The physical expectation is that on evolution those two disclinations merge with each
other and annihilate, leaving no energy in the end. Recall that for the equilibrium solutions,
P = 20. With this relatively high penalty on the non-convex term, we ﬁnd that while the two
oppositely charged disclinations evolve to their equilibrium conﬁgurations, they simply do
not evolve from their equilibrium positions and annihilate, contrary to physical expectation.
This can be understood as follows: invoking a dynamical process for the evolution requires

21

−20−1001020−25−20−15−10−50510152025−20−1001020−25−20−15−10−50510152025continuous evolution in time of the ﬁelds at any spatial point. For a disclination to move,
the value of |λ| at a spatial point ahead of the core has to rise continuously from 0 to
2πk/a (for a prescribed value of k) over a ﬁnite time interval. However, for the intervening
states in this path, states that are not minima of the wells of the function f have to be
sampled, and this leads to a large energy barrier - for large P - that has to be overcome by
the driving forces arising from director gradients (grad θ). What occurs in the calculations
is that large restoring energetic forces arise from the multiwell term that forces the spatial
point (just ahead of the core) to stay at the minima of the 0-well of the function f . Hence
the disclination cannot move.

A natural remedy then is to think of reducing the penalty on the non-convex term -
giving it the ﬂavor of a physical component of the total energy function rather than an
artiﬁcial mathematical device to represent a constraint limiting |λ| values to discrete states.
To this end, we set P = 2. This raises another problem. The results from the gradient ﬂow
clearly do not match our expectation; there is a clear energy pattern near the core area, as
observed in Figure 11(d), where the two white lines are artiﬁcially inserted to display the
top and bottom layer boundaries. Even worse, there is a large area outside the layer where
the corresponding director proﬁle is inhomogeneous, as shown in Figure 11(c). Clearly, the
physical expectation is that the disclinations should annihilate moving in a straight line
leaving behind a homogeneous director ﬁeld with horizontal orientation everywhere except
the layer, and zero energy everywhere (including the layer). This does not happen because
with a lower penalty, λ can evolve from 0, not only along the layer but elsewhere as well
wherever there is a driving force, and, indeed, since there are director gradients outside the
layer where |λ| = 0, there is no impediment to growth of λ at such points, since a steady
state of (5)1 is given by θ,i = λi, up to constraints posed by Dirichlet boundary conditions
as well as the incompatibility of the ﬁeld λ.

5 A dynamic model for nematic disclinations in 2D

We seek an alternative to the gradient ﬂow dynamics of the energy (5) to model energet-
ically driven disclination dynamics. We follow the ideas in [2] motivated from the ﬁeld of
dislocation dynamics in solids to derive an appropriate model for the dynamics of straight
wedge disclinations (a 2d model,) based on the statements of balance of mass, linear and
angular momentum, the second law of thermodynamics, and a conservation statement for
topological charge of these lines. We ﬁrst show the derivation of the general 2D theory, and
then derive a simple layer model from the theory as a particular example. In this section, λ
and θ have the same meanings as in Sections 3.

5.1 Derivation for general 2D case

As before, we assume that the energy E is given in the form of

E =

aξ , with a → 0. For the sake of numerical approximation, we shall choose a as a

positive scalar that allows us to approximate director discontinuities of inﬁnite magnitude.
k = n
2 (n can be any integer) is the disclination strength. To be concise in the following
derivations, we denote

e := grad θ − λ
b := curl(e).

b = curl(grad θ−λ) represents the departure of the director distortion from being the director
gradient. In the absence of defects, e = grad θ and hence b = curl(grad θ) = 0. Thus, b is
considered as the defect ﬁeld.

Balancing the content of topological charge carried by defect lines within arbitrary area

patches, a conservation law for the defect ﬁeld [2] emerges in the form

The mechanical dissipation is the conversion of mechanical energy into heat, namely the
diﬀerence between external power supplied to the body and the sum of the total rate of
change of kinetic energy and the rate of change of free energy. In this case, the dissipation
reads as (we ignore kinetic energy and ﬂow here for simplicity)

Based on the second law of thermodynamics, we need to ensure a non-negative dissipation

It is characterized in the most simple of circumstances by choosing v of the form

with m = 0 and Bm is a material constant required on dimensional grounds. The parameter
m can probe diﬀerent types of behaviors. With this choice of v, we can verify that the
dissipation is larger or equal to zero globally, which means the second law of thermodynamics
is satisﬁed by our model.

We have ignored ﬂow, and assume that balance of linear momentum and mass are trivially
satisﬁed. Balance of angular momentum, assuming no director momentum is given by

div(m) = 0.

24

This reduces to the governing equation

div(grad θ − λ) = 0.

(10)

The utility of (9) over the gradient ﬂow dynamics (5) is the presence of a non-vanishing
curl λ in the evolution of the λ ﬁeld in (9)2. At spatial points where λ is zero and curl λ =
0, λ cannot evolve (regardless of the value of the penalty parameter P ); however, at the
boundaries of the core region where one might expect λ = 0 but curl λ (cid:54)= 0, evolution is
possible allowing motion of the core.

5.2 A ‘layer’ model

5.2.1 Model description

Based on the above formalism for the general 2-d case, we build a simple layer model to ex-
plore several physically fundamental behaviors of disclination defects. The model is directly
adapted from [43] that was developed for dislocation dynamics in solids, with a translation
for symbols representing the diﬀerent ﬁelds in the two models.

In the following, we will interchangeably refer to the coordinates x1 as x and x2 as y.
A subscript x, y, or t, even when not following a subscript comma, will refer to partial
diﬀerentiation with respect to those independent variables.

The fundamental assumption is that disclinations are allowed to move in a horizontal
line, regularized here to a thin layer (with the correct scaling properties so that total energy
remains ﬁnite even in the limit a → 0). Consider a square geometry with a layer L of
thickness l = aξ, as shown in Figure 12,

V = {(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ [−L/2, +L/2] × [−L/2, +L/2]}
L = {(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ [−L/2, +L/2] × [−l/2, +l/2]}

0 ≤ l < L, L > 0.

6 Disclination annihilation, repulsion, and dissociation

We explore several disclination dynamic cases (in the absence of ﬂow) within the 2D layer
model. The domain is shown in Figure 12 with geometry 50 × 50. The parameter a = 1 is
assumed the same as in the gradient ﬂow simulations. The layer ﬁeld λ is prescribed and
restricted within a thin layer whose thickness is a, so that the disclination can only move
along the x direction. The penalty parameter P is set to 1 (recall that in the gradient ﬂow
simulations P = 20, and P = 2 was unsuccessful in recovering physically expected equilib-
ria). In the following, we will demonstrate and discuss results on disclination annihilation,
repulsion, and dissociation.

In this section, all cases are calculated from φ evolution equations with m = 0, unless

otherwise mentioned.

6.1 Disclination annihilation

We start with disclination annihilation, which the gradient ﬂow approach failed to predict
in Section 4.6. Even in this dynamic ‘layer problem’, if P = 20, and m = 2 (i.e. the analog
of the gradient ﬂow in the layer case), we ﬁnd that, as expected, the oppositely charged

28

2 and − 1

disclinations do not annihilate. Within the layer ansatz and now setting P = 1, initially, a
disclination dipole, i.e., two disclinations with opposite signs of + 1
2, is prescribed
as shown in Figure 13(a). The horizontal axis in Figure 13 represents the x axis along
the layer and the vertical axis shows the magnitude of φ. Figure 13(b) shows the director
ﬁeld corresponding to the initialized φ prescription obtained by solving (11)1. Figure 14
shows the snapshots of defect movement during the simulation. The vertical axis shows the
gradient of φ along the layer (φx), representing the location of the core. Diﬀerent colors
represent the results at diﬀerent times and at each time two opposite bumps are interpreted
as a disclination dipole because curl λ = −b = φxe3. As time evolves, these two cores move
toward each other, and ﬁnally merge. In the ﬁnal result, the disclination dipole annihilates
and no disclination exists in the body.

The diﬀerence between the disclination repulsion and annihilation is that now two disclina-
tions with the same sign are used in the initial condition, as shown in Figure 16(a). Figure
16(b) shows the director ﬁeld corresponding to the initial φ prescription. Figure 17 repre-
sents the motions of the disclination cores during the dynamic simulation. We observe that
the two disclinations move apart due to the repulsive force of elastic origin between them.

Figure 19 compares the the velocity versus dipole separation relationship of a single discli-
nation in a dipole ﬁeld, with the expected result from the linear theory of defects [45]. In
each case, the two disclinations are initialized with a separation distance of 50 in a body of
100 × 100. a is set to be 0.5 in these cases. The core locations are marked at every 200 time
steps and the physical discrete time at these instants is recorded. This allows the determi-
nation of the (absolute) velocity of (any) one disclination in the dipole pair as a function
of the separation distance, as shown in Figure 19. In (11), τ serves as the driving force for
the disclination motion. The driving force on one disclination of the dipole core is generated
from the elastic interaction with the other disclination, which scales like the reciprocal of
the separation distance according to the linear theory of defects. Hence, the motion of the
disclinations slows down as the separation distances increases. In Figure 19, the red line
presents a trend of 1/r while the blue line represents the velocity of one disclination. Figure
19(a) shows the relationship between velocity and separation distance in the m = 1 case.
Thus, the velocity matches with 1/r trend very well in this case. Figure 19(b) shows the re-
lationship between velocity and separation distance in m = 2 case. In this case, the velocity
is the largest of all the three cases and matches 1/r trend in the large separation distance
range. Within the separation distance from 5 to 15, the disclinations begin to annihilate.
For m = 0 case, the disclinations are found not to move until the separation distance is less
than 35. Figure 20 shows the velocity proﬁle of the m = 0 case. It shows that the velocity
does not match the 1/r very well when the separation distance is small but has a better
agreement with 1/r trend as far away separation distance.

We note here that there is no reason, a-priori, for the velocity in our nonlinear, dynamic
model to match the expected result from the notion of ‘non-Newtonian forces’ of static defect
theory [45, 41] but our results demonstrate that to a large extent there is consonance between
our results and that of traditional defect theory. However, the diﬀerences are noteworthy as
well - in particular the emergence of apparent ‘intrinsic pinning’ in a translationally-invariant
pde model (cf.[44] where the details of this phenomena are investigated in greater detail) for
the case m = 0, the most natural kinetic model in our setting.

We model the process of a strength-one disclination dissociating into two strength-half discli-
nations. Dissociations of a positive and a negative strength-one disclination are simulated.
We prescribe a strength +1 disclination at the center of the body as shown in Figure
21(a). Figure 21(b) shows the director ﬁeld corresponding to the initial λ. The initial
condition on the θ ﬁeld is generated by solving for moment equilibrium using the Neumann
boundary condition on the director ﬁeld corresponding to the moment distribution on the
boundary generated from the exact solution for a strength +1 disclination in an inﬁnite
medium. During evolution, a 0-moment Neumann boundary condition is imposed. Figure
22 shows how the strength +1 disclination splits into two +1/2 disclinations. We observe
that the strength +1 disclination ﬁrst splits into two strength +1/2 disclinations and then
these two strength +1/2 disclinations move apart and repel each other.

Similarly, the director ﬁeld behaviors are shown in Figure 23. Initially, the director ﬁeld
represents a strength +1 disclination. And then it splits into two strength +1/2 disclinations
from the core and these two disclinations are both subject to repulsion. From the energy
density plots, we can also see that the energy core splits into two cores and these two energy

The splitting of a strength −1 disclination is similar. We prescribed a strength −1
disclination at the center of the body as shown in Figure 24(a) and the boundary conditions
were set up following exactly the procedure for the previous case, accounting for the change
in strength of the disclination. Figure 25 shows the process of the strength −1 disclination
splitting into two strength −1/2 ones.

strength +1 disclination dissociation.

In this Section, we will consider a diﬀerent λ initialization as follows

a e2,

if |y| < a
otherwise,

2 and x ≥ 0

in order to probe the extent of the dependence of the dissociation phenomena, i.e. defect
core dynamics aﬀected by the evolution of the couple stress ﬁeld in the body, on the ﬁne
details of the layer ﬁeld (λ) evolution.

This new initialization can be achieved by applying a kπ

a shift on the original λ ﬁeld
within the layer, while keeping the ‘jump’ of λ within the layer same equal to 2kπ
a . Figure
27(a) shows the new φ initialization for +1 disclination dissociation, and Figure 27(b) is the
director ﬁeld corresponding to the φ initialization. Figure 27(c) and Figure 27(d) show the
results of dissociations of strength +1 disclination. With the new initialization, the single
2 disclinations. Figure 28 shows the |λ|
strength +1 disclination still dissociates into two + 1
evolutions with two diﬀerent φ initializations, and the comparison of φ and φx at diﬀerent
time steps during the +1 disclination dissociation. In Figure 28, the solid lines represent the
results from the “old” initialization applied in Section 6.4, while the broken lines represent
the results from the new initialization. Although |λ| and φ are diﬀerent at every time step,
φx maintains the same proﬁle during the whole dissociation process, which shows that the
dissociations are the same with these two diﬀerent λ initializations. The −1 disclination
dissociation shows the same results. The +1 disclination splits into two +1/2 disclinations
and the −1 disclination splits into two −1/2 disclinations. Thus, although the initializations
are diﬀerent, the dissociation processes of ±1 disclinations are same as before.

This example shows that to the extent that two λ evolutions maintain identical disclina-
tion ﬁelds, the dynamics and energetics of the defect ﬁeld, at least at an overall ‘macroscopic’
observational level, appears to be unaltered. This fact has important modeling implications,
as will be discussed in the last Section 8.

7 Modiﬁcation of the gradient ﬂow dynamics to deal

with disclination motion

In Section 4.6, we have shown that the gradient ﬂow dynamics cannot deal with disclination
motion. In this section, motivated by the insights gained from the disclination dynamics
model in Sections 5 and 6, we suggest a modiﬁcation to the gradient ﬂow dynamics to enable
it to solve physically realistic disclination dynamics problems. Recall the evolution equation

feature of the curl λ multiplier allows evolution only at points where curl λ is non-zero, i.e.
in the core and immediate vicinity of the core. Thus, instead of using the regular gradient

Based on the above modiﬁed evolution equation, we recalculate the disclination annihi-

and director results from Section 4.6, the energy density as well as the director results ob-
tained from the modiﬁed evolution equations, shown in Figure 29(c) and (d), are much more
reasonable, matching physical expectation.

8 Some observations

We conclude with three further observations.

Figure 30 shows a comparison of the norm of two diﬀerent λ ﬁelds for the +1/2 discli-
nation. Figure 30(a) is the norm ﬁeld of the new λ prescription and Figure 30(b) shows

43

−20−1001020−25−20−15−10−50510152025−20−1001020−25−20−15−10−50510152025the norm of the λ ﬁeld given in Figure 3. The curl λ ﬁelds are identical in these two λ
settings. Figure 31 shows the director pattern and energy density results based on the two
λ prescriptions given in Figure 30. As theoretically explained in [3], the comparison shows
that as far as static director and energy distributions are concerned, an identical ‘one-point’
speciﬁcation of the director on the domain renders two distinct λ ﬁelds with identical curlλ
ﬁelds, indistinguishable. Furthermore, the results of Section 6.5 show that this invariance is
carried over to the disclination dynamics as well. Of course, this invariance is not to be mis-
taken with ‘gauge-invariance’ in the sense that, for a ﬁxed b ﬁeld, the theory requires the use
of at least one, non-divergence-free λ ﬁeld of the ‘layer-type’ consistent with b = − curl λ for
the correct prediction of the director distribution, i.e. not employing a λ ﬁeld and insisting
on just the use of the b ﬁeld is not feasible (even though, in some instances, not introducing
a layer-type λ ﬁeld can suﬃce for the correct prediction of only the energy density ﬁeld).
This partial invariance of the results of our model with respect to the precise details of the
λ ﬁeld suggests a useful freedom in numerical simulations. Essentially, in principle, the λ
ﬁeld can be reinitialized at every instant of time, consistent with the evolving b ﬁeld. Thus,
a strategy may be to evolve the b ﬁeld instead of λ and use the λ construct to simply
facilitate the calculation of the energetics and the director distribution at each instant of
time. Moreover, our demonstration that a ‘layer’ of ﬁnite thickness is merely a geometric
approximation, without energetic consequences, of a surface of director-vector discontinuity
suggests natural ways of associating a ‘non-turning’ director distribution within the layer for
calculations of Leslie-Ericksen viscous stresses. We shall demonstrate such features in future
work.

director and energy distributions.

Second, Appendix B shows the energetic, dynamic, and topological interoperability be-
tween our model of disclination dynamics in nematic liquid crystals with orientational order
and that of screw dislocation dynamics in elastic solids with positional order. We consider
this as a positive development that can only beneﬁt the understanding of defect dynamics
in liquid crystals and elastic solids, leading to their plasticity.

Third, there are very interesting similarities and contrasts between the models and results
of energy driven pattern formation discussed in the papers [46, 47, 48, 49, 50] and our model.

A Numerical Schemes for φ evolution equations in 2D

layer model

We adapt the computational scheme developed in [44] for an exactly similar problem in the
context of dislocation dynamics to solve our equations.

For the sake of completeness, we reproduce the details of the scheme from that paper with
appropriate adjustments for ﬁeld variable names and parameters. The numerical scheme we
adopt to solve the problem is identical to that in [44], again with just a translation of the
names of the ﬁeld variables. We include the details here for completeness. In general, the
Finite Element Method (FE) is used to solve the equation for balance of linear momentum
in a staggered scheme that utilizes φ as a given quantity obtained by evolving it in the
remaining part of the scheme. The general computing ﬂow is shown in Figure 32.

An FE mesh with an embedded 1-d ﬁnite diﬀerence grid is used. We use linear quadri-
lateral elements, with 5 × 5 Gauss quadrature points. All elements are of uniform size over
the whole domain.

The 1-d, ﬁnite diﬀerence grid is embedded in the layer, coincident with the line y = 0.
Suppose that the layer is meshed into M rows and N columns, where N is the total number
of 1-d grid points and M is always an odd number so that the middle row of elements always
have centers on y = 0. Each column of FE elements in the layer correspond to exactly one
(cid:82) a/2
grid point. Let xk be the x coordinate of the kth 1-d grid point, which is at the center of
the kth element in the (M + 1)/2 row of layer elements. Recall that τ (xk) is deﬁned as
−a/2 (θy − φ) dy. Let (θy − φ)(I, k) denotes the integrand evaluated at the I th Gauss point

The numerical scheme developed in [51] is adopted and improved to solve (11)2, the
φ evolution. The scheme is called upwinding as the basic idea is to infer the direction
of wave propagation from the linearization of (11)2 and use this direction in the actual
nonlinear equation. Let us denote time step with (cid:52)t and spatial grid size of the ﬁnite

convergence, an explicit treatment of the diﬀusion term in (11)2 becomes prohibitive because
of a (cid:52)t = O((cid:52)h2) scaling. This is circumvented by treating the φxx term implicitly, resulting
in a linearly implicit scheme as follows. We ﬁrst linearize (11)2 and discretized:

The right hand side of the equation is known at current time k. But noting that φk+1
xx (xh) is
again computed from φk+1 at xh+1, xh and xh−1, a system of linear equations of size N has
to be solved to get φk+1. The computational expense of the linear solve is small compared
to the savings obtained by relaxing (cid:52)tk corresponding to the explicit treatment of diﬀusion.

B Layer model for the screw dislocation case

Paralleling the development in Section 5.2, we deﬁne a layer model for straight screw dislo-
cation dynamics in solids in this section. Consider the similar geometry as in Section 5.2 as
shown in Figure 12:

V = {(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ [−W, +W ] × [−H, +H]}
L = {(x, y) : (x, y) ∈ [−W, +W ] × [−l/2, +l/2]}

0 ≤ l < 2H, W > 0.

The screw dislocation problem is one of anti-plane shear, i.e. there is only one non-vanishing
displacement component of the solid, this being the out-of-plane one which is a function of
the in-plane coordinates. In the present physical context, u is the displacement vector and
U P is the plastic distortion tensor, that plays an analogous role to λ. The conservation law
for the defect ﬁeld for the screw dislocation [44] is given in the form

˙α = − curl(α × v).

The displacement is assumed to be of the form

and U P takes the form

U P =

(cid:40)

u = w(x, y)e3

φ(x, t)e3 ⊗ e2
0

in the layer
otherwise.

We assume v to be of the form v = v(x, t)e1.

Therefore, α is also non-zero only in the layer, with component form

α = − curl U P = −φxe3 ⊗ e3

curl α = φxxe3 ⊗ e2.

Here, K is a shear modulus with dimension F orce × Length−2;  = KCaξ2 is a parameter
characterizing the energy density of the dislocation core; ξ is the Burgers vector magnitude of
the dislocation, proportional to the lattice interatomic distance (with dimensions of Length),
C is a non-dimensional parameter to control the magnitude of the core energy, and the
product aξ is the separation between two atomic layers with a ≥ 0 a non-dimensional
scaling factor. Unlike the nematic disclination case, the layer has a physical signiﬁcance
in the case of the crystal dislocation as does the λ ﬁeld in predicting, often ‘stress-free,’
permanent plastic deformation (with respect to a ﬁxed reference) due to the motion of
dislocations. The combination γf represents the ‘generalized stacking fault energy’ reﬂecting
lattice symmetries, and measurable from controlled computational atomistic experiments
([52]) and we assume the simple forms γ = P K

where P is a dimensionless parameter.

From ˙α = − curl(α × v), we have φt = −φxv(x, t). Given the ansatz, only the layer is

relevant for the dissipation and it can be written as

D =

v{[T32 − τ b + φxx](−φx)}dv,

where

and

As in Section 5.2 , we take the average of (wy − φ) over the layer and requiring the

dissipation D ≥ 0, the evolution equation for φ reads as

Again, Bm is a non-negative coeﬃcient characterizing energy dissipation with physical di-
mensions depending on m. The parameter m can be chosen to probe diﬀerent types of
behavior. By introducing the following dimensionless variables,

˜x =

and the ﬁrst equation represents static balance of forces (balance of linear momentum), for

As can be seen from a comparison of (17) and (11), the governing equations of the screw

dislocation model are exactly analogous to the disclination model.
