phase diagram. Upon Co substitution on the Fe site, the structural/magnetic phase transitions in
this 112 compound are suppressed and superconductivity up to 20 K occurs. Our measurements of
the superconducting and magnetic volume fractions show that these two phases coexist microscop-
ically in the underdoped region, in contrast to the related 10-3-8 Ca10(Pt3As8)((Fe1−xPtx)2As2)5
compound, where coexistence is absent. Supported by model calculations, we discuss the diﬀerences
in the phase diagrams of the 112 and 10-3-8 compounds in terms of the FeAs interlayer coupling,
whose strength is aﬀected by the character of the spacer layer, which is metallic in the 112 and
insulating in the 10-3-8.

Since the observation of 26 K superconductivity (SC)
in LaFeAsO1−xFx [1], several families of Fe-based super-
conductors (FBS) have been discovered. Among them,
Ca1−xLaxFeAs2 (CaLa112) with Tc up to 42 K, crys-
talizes in a monoclinic lattice [2, 3]. This crystal struc-
ture based on the FeAs-(Ca/La)-As-(Ca/La)-FeAs stack-
ing contains the prototypical FeAs layers made of the
edge-sharing FeAs4 tetrahedra, as well as As layers made
of zig-zag chains. The presence of these As chains has
made CaLa112 unique in many aspects. Our recent study
shows the Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 compound, which has an ef-
fectively electron overdoped FeAs layer, is the “parent”
compound of the CaLa112 FBS, highlighting the dual na-
ture of itinerant and localized magnetism in FBS [4]. In
this material, a monoclinic to triclinic structural phase
transition occurs at 58 K and a paramagnetic to stripe
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition appears at 54
K. Furthermore, metallic spacer layers are observed via
ARPES measurement [4, 5]. Besides Ca doping, which
adds hole-like carriers, Co substitution on the Fe sites,
which adds electron-like carriers, can also stabilize SC in
Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 [4, 6–8]. Therefore, as a FBS series
with metallic spacer layers and no C4 rotational symme-
try, the characterization of the Co doped CaLa112 is of
particular interest. Here we report a systematic study
of Co doped Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 (Co-CaLa112). We show
that upon Co doping, the structure/magnetic phase tran-
sitions in Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 are suppressed and bulk SC
up to 20 K emerges. Using the x=0.046 sample as a
representative, we present the superconducting proper-
ties of the Co-CaLa112 FBS. In particular, microscopic
coexistence of AFM and SC in this system is revealed
by combined µSR, susceptibility and neutron scattering

measurements. We contrast this behavior with the re-
lated 10-3-8 compound Ca10(Pt3As8)((Fe1−xPtx)2As2)5,
which has similar FeAs interlayer spacing as Co-CaLa112,
but displays no AFM-SC coexistence. We interpret this
diﬀerence in terms of the nature of the spacer layer, which
is metallic in the 112 compound but insulating in the 10-
3-8 system.

Single crystals of Ca0.74(1)La0.26(1)(Fe1−xCox)As2 were
grown out of self-ﬂux at the ratio of CaAs : LaAs : FeAs
: CoAs : As = 1.3 : 0.5 : 1-x : x : 0.7 [4]. Zero ﬁeld
(ZF) and longitudinal ﬁeld (LF) µSR experiments on ∼
200 mg of single crystals with random orientations were
performed in a conventional Helium gas ﬂow cryostat in
TRIUMF, Canada. Single crystal neutron diﬀractions
were collected on the x = 0.025 sample using HB-1A
triple-axis spectrometer located at the High Flux Isotope
Reactor of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Since both La and Co concentrations can vary, wave-
length dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) measurements
were performed on at least 5 pieces in each batch to
determine the concentration of the sample. The result
is summarized in Fig. 1 (a), showing that the ratio of
xWDS/xnominal
is ∼ 0.63. Throughout the paper, we
take x to be the xWDS value. The maximum Co dop-
ing achieved is at x = 0.065 while the growth with
higher Co concentrations is unsuccessful. The concen-
tration of La in each batch has a random variation as
0.270(4), 0.250(10), 0.269(3), 0.259(5), 0.249(7), 0.264(2)
and 0.270(6) for x = 0, 0.008, 0.025, 0.033, 0.046, 0.056
and 0.065, respectively. Since La concentration shows
some variation, we label it as 0.26(1) in the chemical
formula for simplicity.
In each batch, the FeAs inter-
layer distance is inferred by measuring the (0, 0, l) X-ray

peaks diﬀracted from the ab planes of several single crys-
tals. For x = 0, the interlayer distance is d ≈10.36 ˚A,
comparable to the value in the 10-3-8 FBS [9]. Upon
Co doping, the interlayer distance shrinks, decreasing by
0.22% at x = 0.065. This is comparable to the decrease of
the interlayer distance at similar Co doping in BaFe2As2
[10].

Figure 1 (b) shows the representative temperature de-
pendence of R/R300K, highlighting the resistive anoma-
lies in the x = 0 and x = 0.008 samples. The derivatives
of the R/R300K with temperature for these two samples
are shown in Fig. 1(c). Two-kink features are observed in
dR/R300K/dT with the higher temperature kink associ-
ated with the monoclinic to triclinic phase transition and
the lower temperature kink related to the paramagnetic
to antiferromagnetic phase transition [4]. The structural
phase transition temperature Ts and the magnetic phase
transition temperature Tm are inferred by the criterion

shown in Fig. 1(c). The resistive anomaly in the “par-
ent” compound is suppressed with Co doping and bulk
SC shows up at 10 K in the x = 0.025 sample. Tc then
increases to 20 K in the x = 0.046 sample and ﬁnally is
suppressed back to 16 K in the x = 0.065 sample. Fig-
ure 1(d) shows the temperature dependent susceptibility
data taken at 5 Oe. Except for the x = 0.025 sample,
the ZFC 4πχ data show a relatively sharp drop below
Tc and saturate at low temperature with the magnitude
of ZFC 4πχ at 2 K spreading from -110% to -120%,
which are comparable to the ones in the prototype Co
doped Ba122 [10], suggesting 100% of SC shielding frac-
tion here. Because of demagnetization eﬀects, when a
thin disk of radius a and thickness of c ≪ a is placed
in a ﬁeld H k a, its intrinsic susceptibility is given by
χintrinsic = χexp/(1 − 4πN χexp), where N = 0.5πc/a and
χexp is the value in Fig. 1(d). For the x = 0.025 batch,
the average c/a ratio of the four pieces measured is 0.10
and 4πχexp at 2 K is -90%, resulting in an average SC
shielding fraction of 80% at 2 K without saturation. The
small Meissner fraction inferred from the FC data indi-
cates strong ﬂux pinning, a common feature in FBS. The
representative Hall coeﬃcient data taken for the x = 0
and x = 0.033 samples are presented in Fig. 1(e). Their
negative values indicate that electron carriers dominate
the transport properties. Since RH = 1
nq , where n is
the carrier density, the decrease of |RH | accompanied
with Co doping suggests larger n, consistent with the fact
that Co doping adds extra electron carriers into the sys-
tem. Note that the SC sample with the chemical formula
Ca0.82La0.18FeAs2 shows a positive Hall coeﬃcient [11],
indicating that the SC in Ca1−xLaxFeAs2 arises from the
hole doping present in Ca0.74La0.26FeAs2.

As a representative, the superconducting properties
of the x = 0.046 sample are shown in Fig. 2. Fig-
ure 2(a) presents the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(T ), which
is determined using the 50% criterion shown in Fig.
1(b). The anisotropy parameter of the upper critical ﬁeld
γH = H ⊥ab
is around 4.7. Since the eﬀective mass
anisotropy Γ is related to γH by Γ = γ2
H = m∗⊥ab/m∗kab,
the mass anisotropy is around 22. Note that γH ≈ 4.7
in 112 is smaller than γH ≈ 8 in the 10-3-8 compound,
which has similar FeAs interlayer distance but insulating
spacer layers [9, 12]. This suggests a stronger FeAs in-
terlayer coupling in 112 arising from the metallic spacer
layers. Figure 2(b) presents the temperature dependent
speciﬁc heat Cp taken at H = 0 T. A bump in Cp as-
sociated with the superconducting phase transition ap-
pears, conﬁrming bulk superconductivity in this sam-
ple. By the equal entropy construction shown in Fig.
2(b), the heat capacity jump ∆Cp/T |Tc is 6.7 mJ/mole-
Fe-K 2 at Tc ≈16 K. This value follows the Budko-Ni-
Canﬁeld(BNC) log-log plot quite well [13], suggesting
that Cp ∝ T 3
c . Since most of the FBS superconductors
follow this BNC scaling [14], this may suggest an S± pair-

ing symmetry in CaLa112. The ﬁeld dependent current
density Jc at various temperatures is shown in Fig. 2(c).
We have calculated the critical current density based on
the Bean model [15], Jc = 20 △M
3l ) , where △M = M+ -
w(1− w
M−, and M+ (M−) is the magnetization associated with
increasing (decreasing) ﬁeld; w, l is the width and length
of the sample separately. At 2 K, Jc reaches 2.2×105
A/cm2, comparable to FeTe0.5Se0.5 and LiFeAs but lower
than Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and SmFeAsO1−x [16]. To under-
stand the mechanism of the vortex motion, the normal-
ized pinning force f = Fp/Fp,max as a function of re-
duced ﬁeld (h = H/Hirr) is plotted in Fig. 2(d), where
Fp = Jc × µ0H [17]. All curves can be scaled well and
characterized by a maximum near h = 0.25. This value
is smaller than most FBS, but close to hmax=0.28 for
FeTe0.7Se0.3 [18], suggesting that both surface pinning
and small size normal core pinning contribute to the vor-
tex motion.

The interplay of structure, antiferromagnetism (AFM)
and SC has been one of the most studied topics in FBS,
especially because spin ﬂuctuations are believed to play
an important role in the pairing mechanism [19–21]. To
determine the phase diagram, and particularly to resolve
if microscopic coexistence between SC and AFM exists
in the Co doped CaLa112, ZF µSR measurements were
performed to estimate the magnetic volume fraction of
the superconducting samples. As a representative, the
ZF asymmetry spectra of the x = 0.033 sample at sev-
eral temperatures are shown in Fig. 3(a). Although no
feature associated with a structural/magnetic phase tran-
sition is observed in the resistivity measurements, upon

decreasing the temperature from 35 K, a fast relaxing
front end is absent at 20 K but clearly shows up at 8
K in Fig. 3(a), suggesting the development of magnetic
order in this sample at low temperature. The ZF asym-
metry spectra are ﬁtted with the function

AZF (t) = A[fT exp (−

(σt)2) + (1 − fT ) exp (−λt)]. (1)

Here fT is the transverse function and denotes the fast
relaxing component coming from the static magnetic or-
der. σ is the fast transverse relaxation rate of µ+. (1−ft)
is the longitudinal fraction, representing the fraction of
muons with spins parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld
in the region with static magnetic order and/or muons
in the paramagnetic volume. The longitudinal fraction
only undergoes the spin lattice relaxation with the rate
λ = 1/T1.

The Gaussian relaxation form arises from the magnetic
ﬁeld produced by randomly oriented magnetic moments,
as expected in our Co-CaLa112 sample. For an ideally
isotropic and fully ordered system, fT is expected to be
0.67 while the fT values at 2 K in x = 0, 0.025 and 0.033
samples are 0.75, 0.72 and 0.58, respectively. The slightly
larger values in the x = 0 and 0.025 samples likely arise
from the ﬁeld anisotropy in these randomly packed plate-
like single crystals. By setting the magnetic volume in
the x = 0 sample to be 100% as proved reasonable in
Ref.
[4], we calculate the magnetic volume of the other
samples, as shown in Fig. 3(b). For the x = 0.025 sam-
ple, due to the sample inhomogeneity, around 6.4% of the
sample is already magnetic at 50 K, but for the rest of the
sample, AFM develops below 31 K and the magnetic vol-
ume fraction Vmag saturates below 20 K with Vmag ≈96%
at 2 K. For the x = 0.033 sample, AFM appears below
12 K and Vmag increases up to 76% at 2 K without satu-
ration. The fast transverse relaxation rate σ is shown in
Fig. 3(c). Since σ is proportional to the size of the mag-
netic moment, which is 1.0 µB/Fe in the x = 0 sample as
revealed by neutron diﬀraction [4], assuming that the µ+
sites remain similar in these measured samples, the mag-
netic moment in the x = 0.033 sample is 0.6µB/Fe while
it remains 1.0µB/Fe in the x = 0.025 sample. The neu-
tron diﬀraction data taken on a x = 0.025 single crystal
are presented in Fig. 3(d). The integrated (0 2 0) nu-
clear peak intensity sharply increases below 35 K, similar
to the one in the x = 0 sample [4], marking the occur-
rence of a structural phase transition. The intensity of
the (0.5 0.5 0.5) magnetic peak abruptly increases below
28 K, indicating the development of long range magnetic
ordering, which is consistent with the µSR data shown
in Fig. 3(b).

Based on the data we discussed above, a T − x phase
diagram is constructed in Fig. 3(e). Upon Co doping, the
structural/magnetic phase transitions are suppressed and
SC up to 20 K emerges. For the x = 0.025 sample, the
magnetic volume fraction determined from the µSR data
is 96%. The SC volume fraction determined from the sus-
ceptibility data is 80%. For the x = 0.033 sample, the SC
volume fraction is 100% while the magnetic volume frac-
tion is at least 76% at 2 K, which has the trend to sharply
increase further at even lower temperature. Therefore,
there is clearly microscopic coexistence between SC and
AFM in x = 0.025 and 0.033 samples, similar to most
doped Ba122 compounds and the Ca1−xLaxFeAs2 [22–
29].

It is instructive to compare these results for the 112
Ca1−xLaxFeAs2 compound with those for the 10-3-8
Ca10(Pt3As8)((Fe1−xPtx)2As2)5 system. Both of them
have similar atomic constituents and very close values
for the interlayer FeAs distance. However, in contrast to
the 112, where an extended AFM-SC coexistence region
emerges, the 10-3-8 shows no coexistence – or at best
a very limited region of coexistence [30, 31]. One of the

Figure 4. The coeﬃcient g as function of the tight-binding
parameters t0 and t1 in Eq. (4), under the constraint t2 =
−t0 − t1 to maintain the perfect nesting condition at kz =
0. Note that g = 0 at the black lines, whereas g < 0 in
the blue-shaded region (implying AFM-SC microscopic phase
coexistence) and g > 0 and in the red-shaded region (implying
AFM-SC macroscopic phase separation).

most salient diﬀerences between these two classes of com-
pounds is the fact that in the 10-3-8, the spacer layer is
insulating, whereas in the 112 it is metallic. This diﬀer-
ence is manifest, for instance, in the larger Hc2 anisotropy
of the former (γH ≈ 8) over the latter (γH ≈ 4.7). Pre-
sumably, the existence of a metallic spacer layer enhances
the FeAs interlayer coupling in the 112, making it more
three-dimensional. Although several factors could be at
play, it is tempting to attribute the presence of the AFM-
SC coexistence region in these systems to the diﬀerence
in their degree of three-dimensionality promoted by the
distinct characters of the spacer layers.

In order to investigate whether the more pronounced
kz band dispersion of the 112 material favors the micro-
scopic coexistence of AFM and SC, we consider a toy
two-band model widely employed in the FBS to study
the competition of AFM and SC [32–34]. This model is
characterized by a hole-pocket with dispersion ξh at the
center of the Brillouin zone and an electron-pocket with
dispersion ξe at the corner of the Brillouin zone. The
fate of the competing AFM-SC phases is determined by
a single coeﬃcient g, which depends on the quartic co-
eﬃcient of the microscopically-derived Ginzburg-Landau
expansion [35]:
if g > 0, the competition between the
phase is so strong that there is no coexistence, whereas if
g < 0, their competition is weak enough to allow them to
coexist microscopically. In the hypothetical perfect nest-
ing limit, ξe = −ξh, s+− SC and AFM are at the verge of
coexistence or macroscopic phase separation, with g = 0.
Deviations from perfect nesting then determine whether
g becomes positive or negative. Previously, deviations
of perfect nesting arising from the in-plane band disper-
sions were studied [32, 34]. Here, we consider deviations

arising from the out-of-plane band dispersion, and write
ξe = −ξh + λb (kz), with the general kz-dispersion:

b (kz) = t0 + t1 cos(pz) + t2 cos(2pz)

(2)

To ensure that the system is nested at kz = 0, the
tight-binding coeﬃcients are constrained to t2 = −t0−t1.
In Fig. 4 [35], we compute the value of g in the (t0, t1)
parameter space. Clearly, g < 0 in a wide region of the
parameter space, showing that in general the kz disper-
sion can promote microscopic coexistence between SC
and AFM. Thus, this simple calculation lends support to
the idea that the enhanced interlayer coupling in the 112
promoted by the metallic spacer contributes to the stabi-
lization of a regime of microscopic AFM-SC coexistence
in the phase diagram.

In summary, we have mapped out the T − x phase di-
agram of the Ca0.74(1)La0.26(1)(Fe1−xCox)As2 supercon-
ductors. Microscopic coexistence between AFM and SC
exists in this FBS. A phenomenological two-band model
suggests the dispersion along kz direction may favors
AFM-SC microscopic coexistence over phase separation.
