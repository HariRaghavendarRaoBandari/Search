ABSTRACT

We present new near-infrared photometric measurements of the core of the young massive cluster NGC 3603 obtained with extreme
adaptive optics. The data were obtained with the SPHERE instrument mounted on ESO’s Very Large Telescope, and cover three
ﬁelds in the core of this cluster. We applied a correction for the eﬀect of extinction to our data obtained in the J and K broadband
ﬁlters and estimated the mass of detected sources inside the ﬁeld of view of SPHERE/IRDIS, which is 13.5"×13.5". We derived the
mass function (MF) slope for each spectral band and ﬁeld. The MF slope in the core is unusual compared to previous results based on
Hubble space telescope (HST) and very large telescope (VLT) observations. The average slope in the core is estimated as −1.06±0.26
for the main sequence stars with 3.5 M(cid:12)< M < 120 M(cid:12). Thanks to the SPHERE extreme adaptive optics, 814 low-mass stars were
detected to estimate the MF slope for the pre-main sequence stars with 0.6 M(cid:12)< M < 3.5 M(cid:12), Γ = −0.54 ± 0.11 in the K-band images
in two ﬁelds in the core of the cluster. For the ﬁrst time, we derive the mass function of the very core of the NGC 3603 young cluster
for masses in the range 0.6 - 120 M(cid:12). Previous studies were either limited by crowding, lack of dynamic range, or a combination of
both.

1. Introduction

Among Galactic spiral arm clusters, the NGC 3603 young clus-
ter, located in its namesake giant HII region (Kennicutt 1984),
is the most compact and youngest cluster with an age of 1 Myr
(Brandl et al. 1999; Stolte et al. 2004; Sung & Bessell 2004) and
a central density of 6×104 M(cid:12) pc−3 (Harayama et al. 2008). The
cluster is known to contain three massive and luminous central
stars with spectral types as early as O2V (Walborn et al. 2002;
Moﬀat et al. 2004), and up to 50 O-type stars in total (Drissen
et al. 1995). The most massive stars exhibit both characteris-
tics of WN6 stars and Balmer absorption lines (Drissen et al.
1995), suggesting that they are actually core hydrogen burning
rather than evolved stars (Conti et al. 1995; de Koter et al. 1997).
Two of these three Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are very close bina-
ries (Schnurr et al. 2008). The total mass of the cluster is esti-
mated as 104 M(cid:12) (Harayama et al. 2008), with an upper limit to
the dynamical mass of 17600 ± 3800 M(cid:12)(Rochau et al. 2010).
NGC 3603 provides a unique opportunity to study the forma-

(cid:63) Based on data collected at

the European Southern Observa-
tory, Chile (Guaranteed Time Observation 095.D-0309(A) and 095.D-
0309(E))

tion of massive stars embedded in clusters at their early stages.
Studying such clusters is not generally straightforward owing to
the limited angular resolution of telescopes in addition to un-
certainties from existing models (Ascenso et al. 2009). Besides,
extinction from the Galactic plane and the birth place of massive
stars, which is immersed in dust and gas, play an important role.

All these combined eﬀects can introduce an observational
bias that hampers diﬀerentiating models of massive star and clus-
ter formation: i.e., singular collapse of a rotating molecular cloud
core with subsequent fragmentation in a ﬂattened disk or com-
petitive accretion, or, for example, external triggering by cloud-
cloud collision (ref., e.g., Johnston et al. 2014). To test these
models, high angular resolution observation in the infrared are
the best strategy as they minimize the eﬀects of source confu-
sion and spatial extinction variations.

In this context, the extreme adaptive optics (XAO) of the new
instrument SPHERE (Beuzit et al. 2008) on the VLT, enabled us
to observe deeper in the core of NGC 3603 in the near-infrared
J and K bands to better probe the massive star cluster at a high
resolution in the range of 20-40 mas resolution, which is compa-
rable to the HST in the visible.

2. Data and photometry

We obtained data via Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) runs
to image NGC 3603 using the dual mode of IRDIS (Langlois
et al. 2014), enabling simultaneous observations in two spec-
tral bands on the VLT. The observations were performed in two
epochs in 2015 (March and June), with high dynamic and spa-
tial resolution imaging of three regions, each with a ﬁeld of view
(FoV) of 13.5” × 13.5”, one centered on the core of the cluster
(F0) and two regions (F1 and F2) to cover the radial extent of the
cluster (Figure 1 Top). To facilitate homogeneous photometric
calibrations, F1 and F2 partially overlap with F0. The data con-
sist of 400, 300, and 320 frames of 0.8s exposures in the IRDIS
broadband K ﬁlter (IRDIS/BB-K) for F0, F1, and F2, respec-
tively, and 400, 150, and 160 frames of 4.0, 2.0, and 2.0s expo-
sures in IRDIS broadband J (IRDIS/BB-J), respectively, during
the two observing epochs. Neutral density (ND) ﬁlters were used
for the IRDIS/BB-J data to avoid saturating the brightest stars.
The average airmass during these observations was 1.25-1.26. A
log of the observations is presented in Table 1.

We used the SPHERE pipeline package1, for correcting dark,
ﬂat, distortion, and bad pixels. As SPHERE ﬁlters in BB-J and
BB-K are similar to ESO’s Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System
Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NACO), we corrected
the photometric zero-points of SPHERE by comparing them to
the magnitudes of spectroscopically known stars (preferentially
isolated sources) in NACO (Harayama et al. 2008) J and K ﬁl-
ters.

For the photometry, we used the STARFINDER package im-
plemented in IDL (Diolaiti et al. 2000) to derive the local point
spread function (PSF) to detect stellar objects, while estimating
instrumental magnitudes, i.e., before the photometric zero-point
corrections. For this, each ﬁeld is divided into subregions to ex-
tract the empirical local PSFs from isolated sources in the image
itself. Local PSFs are then used to extract the ﬂux of the sources
to compensate for the local distortion eﬀect. This is particularly
suitable for AO-assisted imaging data where one can face locally
distorted PSFs that hamper photometric measurements along dif-
ferent parts of the IRDIS FoV.

Consequently, 410 (290), 149 (364), and 445 (682) sources
were detected in the J and K bands in F0, F1, and F2, respec-
tively, by limiting them to a minimum correlation of 0.8 with the
PSF. We also put a threshold limit of one standard deviation of
sky brightness. Table 2 gives the details of the total number of
detected sources in each ﬁeld for a given ﬁlter.

The high Strehl ratio, and the resulting high dynamic range
close to bright stars, enabled us to detect stellar sources that are
10.6 and 9.8 magnitudes fainter than the brightest sources in J
and K bands, respectively. Sources with K magnitude of 18.8 and
J magnitude of 18.9 could be detected in the core of NGC 3603.
Our test experiments for completeness correction (500 artiﬁcial
star per ﬂux) suggest that we should reach a completeness level
>= 80% for stars brighter than 17.5 mag in F1 and F2 in both
J and K bands. The quality (signal-to-noise Ratio) of data in F0
in K band (in March 2015) was not as good as in F1 and F2 in
the second run (June 2015), thus the dynamic range is lower. In
F0, stars brighter than 15.3 in K band and 16.5 in J band have a
completeness level of >= 80%. Table 1 gives the faintest magni-
tudes obtained in the diﬀerent ﬁelds F0, F1, and F2 by SPHERE
within the exposure time limits of the run.

3. Extinction and CMD
In order to correct for extinction, 31 O stars on or close to the
main sequence (class V) were selected from Harayama et al.
(2008). These stars are encircled in green in the top panel of
Figure 1. To estimate their intrinsic magnitude, their Teﬀ were
estimated from Table 4 of Martins et al. (2005) and their log g as
a function of age (1.5 Myr) according to the PARSEC 2 stellar
evolution models (Bressan et al. 2012), adopting Galactic metal-
licity. We assumed a distance of 6 kpc (Section 4) for these O
stars.

We derived the color excess for selected O stars in the two
IRDIS-BB J and K ﬁlters at the distance of 6 kpc. We adopted the
maximum weighted value for E(J-K), which is 0.76 (AV = 4.5).
This value results in AJ and AK as 1.269 and 0.504, respectively,
(from Rieke & Lebofsky (1985)). We found 239, 118, and 191
sources detected in both J and K data in F0, F1, and F2, respec-
tively. The color magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for these diﬀerent
ﬁelds are shown in Figure 2.

4. Mass functions
We used the stellar evolution tracks from PARSEC mentioned
above to estimate stellar masses at the age of 1.5 Myr. The dis-
tance of the cluster was taken as 6 kpc, which ﬁts well with the
observed CMD, isochrone, and extinction, and is also in good
agreement with Stolte et al. (2004), De Pree et al. (1999), and
Harayama et al. (2008).

Using grids of stellar evolutionary tracks and extinction for
each ﬁlter, we can estimate the stellar masses separately from
the photometry in each ﬁlter. The slope of the mass function Γ
can be estimated from Eq. 1, where M is the stellar mass and N
is the number of stars in the logarithmic mass interval log10(M)
to log10(M) + 0.2 log10(M). We used a double size bin at the
pre-main sequence (PMS) and main sequence (MS) transition,
around 4 M(cid:12), to smooth out the degeneracy (same as Harayama
et al. (2008)). We used an implementation of the nonlinear least-
squares (NLLS) Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to ﬁt the MF,

log(N) = Γ log(

M
M(cid:12)

) + cst.

Mass functions for the two IRDIS BB-J and BB-K ﬁlters are
shown in Figure 3 for the core (F0) and in Figure 4 for F1 and
F2. One can compare the MF in the very core of the cluster (F0)
with the next radial bin (F1 and F2) to check the radial variation
of MF. The two latter were observed with similar exposure times
and very close conditions as both ﬁelds were recorded within

starts from 0.14 M(cid:12), ending at 69 M(cid:12). More than 800 sources
with a mass smaller than 4 M(cid:12) are detected.

The change of the MF slope for the MS and PMS stars occurs
around 4 M(cid:12). We also ﬁtted a separate line on MF (dash-dotted
line in Figure 4) for the low-mass PMS stars. The mass func-
tion in the low-mass part is corrected for the number of detected
sources above an incompleteness level of 80% (black bins in the
low-mass part in Figure 3 and 4).

Table 2 lists the derived MF slopes in F0, F1, and F2 regions
and derived slopes for MS/PMS stars. MS is a common mass
range in J and K and in F0 and F1+F2 with an incompleteness
level of 100%. The MF slopes are consistent in the J band and
K band and also in the diﬀerent regions, for the main sequence
stars and for the whole mass range.

The MF slopes for the whole mass range is ﬂatter than
the main sequence part. The MF slopes even for the massive
stars (main sequence) are ﬂatter than Salpeter, ΓS alpeter = −1.35
(Salpeter 1955) and Kroupa, ΓKroupa = −1.3 (Kroupa 2001). The
average value agrees with those found in the outer regions of
NGC3603 according to previous works. For pre-main sequence
stars, the MF slope is ﬂatter than for the whole mass range and
for the main sequence.

If we assume that binary properties like binary fraction and
mass-ratio distribution do not change strongly with the mass of
the primary stars, then the deduced mass function slope should
be very similar to the mass function slope of the primary stars.

We could detect 11, 4, and 4 K-excess sources with an E(J-
K) that is higher than 1.8 (for MS) and 2.0 (for PMS), in F0,
F1, and F2, respectively, corresponding to 14 sources in total
(black circles in Figure 2 and red circles in the bottom panels of
Figure 1). For these stars, the mass estimated in K is higher than
in J because of their K excess. Twelve of these stars are on the
sequence parallel to the MS (M > 4 M(cid:12)). In this case, the MF
slopes for the main sequence part in the J band should be more
reliable than in the K band.

5. Discussion and conclusion
NGC 3603 has been observed with various instruments and the
slope of its mass function has been calculated in previous works
(Table 3). These works reach conclusions on the general trend of

imum and maximum magnitudes in both ﬁelds are very similar
especially in the K band. All these conditions result in similar
mass range of detected sources in J and K. Thus we could plot
the MF for F1 and F2 together, where 586 sources are detected
with masses less than 1 M(cid:12) (fainter than 16.5 magnitude) in the
K band.

In F0, we were able to reach 0.66 M(cid:12) (J=18.7) in the J band
and 1.08 M(cid:12) (K=16.4) in the K band. Figure 3 depicts the MF in
F0. Three WR stars (A1, B, C) are located in this region where
two of them (A1 and C) were identiﬁed as spectroscopic binaries
by Schnurr et al. (2008). The MF can be treated in three possi-
ble ways (Table 2): 1) considering all WR stars: two as binaries
with masses estimated from Schnurr et al. (2008) and one (B)
as a single star (All); 2) considering just two WR stars as two
binary systems (All-B); and 3) excluding these three WR stars
(All-WRs).

decreasing MF slopes in the core as the signature of mass segre-
gation. The slopes of the MF in diﬀerent ﬁlters (Table 2) in the
core of NGC 3603 is steeper than the previous works and does
not show a radial dependence in the observed ﬁelds. The slope
value for the main sequence stars and for the whole mass range
is consistent in all observed regions of the core of the cluster.

Shape of MF at the massive end, can be used as an obser-
vational test that may be able to settle the question of which
mechanism (accretion or collision) is a dominant route for the
formation of the most massive stars (Krumholz 2015). Accord-
ing to the accretion models, as the massive stars form by the
same accretion processes that produce low-mass stars (normal
star formation), the high end of the stellar mass function should
be continuous and does not depend radically on the environment
(Krumholz 2015). On the other hand, collisional formation pre-
dicts a large gap in the stellar MF, separating the bulk of the
accretion-formed stellar population from the few collisionally

formed stars (Baumgardt & Klessen 2011; Moeckel & Clarke
2011). This feature should only appear in the most massive and
densest clusters. Figure 3 shows this signature in the core (F0),
but we know that the last bin corresponds to the three WR stars
in which two of them have been found to be multiple objects
and not single stars (Schnurr et al. 2008). Therefore, collisional
formation of very massive objects seems unlikely at least for
the NGC 3603 cluster. Accretion models also predict that mas-
sive stars are likely to have low-mass and high-mass companions
(Kratter & Matzner 2006; Kratter et al. 2008, 2010; Krumholz et
al. 2012), but the collisionally formed stars lack low-mass com-
panions, which provokes segregation.

This study shows no signature of mass segregation in the
core of NGC 3603, ﬁrst, because the MF slope in its very core
is not ﬂatter than the next radial bin. Second, both slopes are
similar to the MF values found in previous works for the outer
regions (references in Table 3). Therefore, it appears that non-
segregated clusters with a smooth MF agree better with accretion
models for massive star formation. Our SPHERE results demon-
strate that, by improved photometric dynamic range and spatial
resolution from XAO, we can overcome the eﬀect of confusion
that in the past has led to the conclusion of observational seg-
regation (see also Ascenso et al. (2009)) as far as NGC 3603 is
concerned.
