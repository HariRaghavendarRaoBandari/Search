REMARKS ON THE BOUNDARY CURVE OF A CONSTANT MEAN

CURVATURE TOPOLOGICAL DISC

DAVID BRANDER AND RAFAEL LOPÉZ

ABSTRACT. We discuss some consequences of the existence of the holomorphic quadratic
Hopf differential on a conformally immersed constant mean curvature topological disc with
analytic boundary. In particular, we derive a formula for the mean curvature as a weighted
average of the normal curvature of the boundary curve, and a condition for the surface to be
totally umbilic in terms of the normal curvature.

A constant mean curvature (CMC) surface is a model for a ﬂuid interface. As such, a
basic conﬁguration of interest is that of a CMC topological disc with boundary. It is well
known that any CMC surface admits a real analytic conformal parameterization. We will
also assume that the boundary is a real analytic curve in R3; under reasonable regularity
assumptions [14] one can then show that the surface extends analytically across the bound-
ary. Applying the smooth Riemann mapping theorem, we thus consider a conformal CMC
immersion f : U ⊃ D → R3, where D is the closed unit disc, and U an open subset of C.

Given a simple closed curve C in R3, Hildebrandt [7] showed that there exists at least one
(possibly branched) CMC topological disc spanning C, if the mean curvature H is not too
large: if C lies in a ball of radius R then solutions exist provided that |H| ≤ 1/R.

In this note we record some observations concerning the consequences that the existence
of the holomorphic quadratic differential of Hopf [8, 9] has for the relationship between

the boundary curve γ := f(cid:12)(cid:12)∂D and the surface. For a general real analytic space curve, the

choice of a surface normal N along the curve and a constant H locally determine a unique
CMC H surface. However, if the curve is closed and the surface is required to be a regular
topological disc, then we will see that the normal curvature κn and the geodesic torsion τg
(obtained from the derivative of N along the curve) are closely related and must satisfy some
integral relations, amongst them:

where z = eit is the restriction of the conformal parameterization to ∂D and s is the arc-

It is important to note that these formulae are only valid for a parameterization t such that
z = eit extends to the disc as a conformal coordinate.

It obviously follows from (1) that the constant H lies in the range [min(κn),max(κn)].

We will in fact conclude:
Theorem 1. Let f : D∪∂D → R3 be a CMC H immersion of a topological disc with regular
analytic boundary C = f (∂D). Let κn and τg be the normal curvature and geodesic torsion
of the curve f|∂D.

(1) The surface is totally umbilic if and only if at least one of κn or τg is constant. In

this case, both are constant and κn ≡ H and τg ≡ 0.

(2) Otherwise, the mean curvature H must satisfy
(κn) < H < max
∂D

min
∂D

(κn).

Any homotopically trivial simple closed curve on a CMC surface can be taken as ∂D in
Theorem 1. This places restrictions on the geometry of such curves. For example, there are
none with constant non-zero geodesic torsion; and none that are lines of curvature (τg = 0)
unless the surface is totally umbilic.
If the surface is totally umbilic, i.e., part of a 2-sphere or a plane, the geodesic torsion
along any curve at all is zero, as is the quantity κn − H. But the characterization of total
umbilicity as the vanishing of just one of these quantities along a closed curve is not valid if
the curve does not bound a topological disc - counterexamples are easily given on a round
cylinder.

Theorem 1 is proved in Section 2. In Section 3 we brieﬂy discuss applications to CMC

surfaces with circular boundary and to capillary surfaces.

2. THE HOPF DIFFERENTIAL AND SOME CONSEQUENCES

2.1. The Hopf differential along a line. Let U ⊂ C be an open set and f : U → R3 be a
conformally parameterized immersion, i.e.,

where ν : U → R>0. Given a choice N of unit normal, the mean curvature is

2(cid:104) fz, f¯z(cid:105) = (cid:104) fx, fx(cid:105) = (cid:104) fy, fy(cid:105) = ν2 > 0,

H =

ν−2(cid:104) fxx + fyy,N(cid:105).

As observed by Hopf [9], if we deﬁne Q = (cid:104)N, fzz(cid:105), then the Codazzi equation gives Q¯z =
ν2Hz/2, so the mean curvature is constant if and only if Q is holomorphic. Assuming this,
the Hopf differential is the (coordinate independent) holomorphic quadratic differential

H = Q(z)dz2, Q = (cid:104)N, fzz(cid:105).

Suppose that U contains the real line. We want an expression for H along R, in terms
of the geometric data of the curve γ(x) = f (x,0). We ﬁrst assume that x is the arc-length
parameter along γ, i.e., that

(cid:104) fx(x,0), fx(x,0)(cid:105) = ν2(x,0) = 1.

changing to the conformal coordinates ζ =(cid:82) z

This assumption can be achieved on a sufﬁciently small open set containing the real line by
0 ˆν(z)dz, where ˆν is the holomorphic extension

of ν(x,0). Under this assumption,the Darboux frame along γ is:

X(x) = fx(x,0), Y (x) = fy(x,0), N(x) = N(x,0).

The geodesic and normal curvatures, κg and κn, and geodesic torsion τg of γ are deﬁned by:

X(cid:48) = κgY + κnN,
Y (cid:48) = −κgX + τgN,
N(cid:48) = −κnX − τgY.

Now the coefﬁcient Q of H is:
1

Q =

((cid:104)N, fxx(cid:105)−(cid:104)N, fyy(cid:105))− 1
2

i(cid:104)N, fxy(cid:105).

Along γ, we have (cid:104)N, fxx(cid:105) = κn and (cid:104)N, fyy(cid:105) = 2H −(cid:104)N, fxx(cid:105). Finally, fxy = Y (cid:48), so (cid:104)N, fxy(cid:105) =
τg. Therefore, along y = 0,

Q =

(κn − H − iτg).

and the principal curvatures are κ± = H ±(cid:113)

Along the curve, the second fundamental form is II = κndx2 + 2τgdxdy + (2H − κn)dy2,
g . Thus the geodesic torsion is a
measure of how far the curve γ deviates from being a line of curvature, and an umbilic point
corresponds to κn − H = τg = 0, that is, to the zeros of the Hopf differential.
Under a change of coordinates, the Hopf differential transforms as H =(cid:104)N, fzz(dζ /dz)2 +
fzd2ζ /dz2(cid:105)dz2 = (cid:104)N, fzz(cid:105)(dζ /dz)2dz2. Dropping the assumption that ν(x,0) = 1, we have:

(H − κn)2 + τ2

Q(x,0) =

(κn(x)− H − iτg(x))ν2(x,0).

2.2. Proof of Theorem 1. Now let f : U ⊃ D → R3 be a conformally parameterized CMC
H immersion, as in the introduction. Let log be any branch of the logarithm function, and
set z = −ilog(w). Then, on an annulus containing S1, we have the situation of the previous
subsection, where the functions κn(x), τg(x) and ν(x,0) are periodic with period 2π. Since
dz2 = −(1/w2)dw2, we have, in the w coordinate,

H = − 1

2w2 (α(w) + iβ (w))dw2 = ˜Q(w)dw2,

where, writing ˆκn, ˆτg and ˆν for the holomorphic extensions of κn(x), τg(x) and ν(x,0)
respectively,

α(w) = ( ˆκn(w)− H) ˆν2(w)

and β (w) = − ˆτg(w) ˆν2(w)

are holomorphic on a neighbourhood of S1, real-valued along S1, and ˆν is non-vanishing
along S1. Because H = ˜Q(w)dw2 is holomorphic on D, it follows that the function

vanishes at least to second order at w = 0. This means that the integrals along S1 of the
functions g(w), g(w)/w and g(w)/w2 are all zero, which gives us:

g(w) = α(w) + iβ (w) = −2w2 ˜Q(w)

The ﬁrst line amounts to (1) and (2), and the second line gives analogous identities with the
integrands multiplied by cos(t) and by sin(t). The fact that α and β are real on S1, together
with the vanishing conditions above, gives us the Fourier expansions:

α(w) =

( ¯αnw−n + αnwn)

and β (w) =

(i ¯αnw−n − iαnwn),

which precisely encodes the relationship between the quantities ν, τg and κn−H that follow
from the holomorphicity of the Hopf differential on D. From this one can read off, for
example, that τg is constant if and only if κn − H is constant, and in this case both are zero.
Since the vanishing of the Hopf differential characterizes umbilics, this proves the ﬁrst part
of Theorem 1. For the second part, (1) implies that min(κn) ≤ H ≤ max(κn). Equality
cannot occur, because then the vanishing of the integral (1) of H − κn would imply that
κn ≡ H, i.e., that the surface is totally umbilic.

3. SOME APPLICATIONS OF THEOREM 1

3.1. CMC discs bounded by a circle. Given a closed curve in R3, Brezis and Coron [2]
showed that there are at least two geometrically distinct CMC H discs spanning the curve,
provided H is small enough (see also [18]). However, it is not known precisely how many
there are. The most basic case imaginable is where the boundary is a circle, which we may
as well take to be of radius 1. If 0 < |H| < 1 there are obviously at least two CMC H discs
bounded by this circle, a large and a small spherical cap on a sphere of radius 1/|H|. It is a
long standing open question, going back as far as the 1980’s [10, 5] whether or not there are
more solutions in the case 0 < |H| < 1. A survey of this problem can be found in [12]. From
Theorem 1 we have that the unit sphere is the only solution for |H| = 1, and, for solutions
that are not totally umbilic,

−1 ≤ min
∂D

(κn) < H < max
∂D

(κn) ≤ 1.

Brito and Sa Earp [3] essentially showed this using the balancing formula or ﬂux formula,
which was found by R. Kusner in his Ph.D. thesis, published in [11], and a proof given
for the immersed case in [13]. It can be stated as follows: if f : M → R3 is a CMC H
immersion of a compact surface with boundary, and γ(s) the arc-length parameterization of
the boundary, then

(cid:90)

∂Σ

(cid:90)

∂Σ

(cid:104)Y,a(cid:105)ds + H

(cid:104)γ × γ(cid:48),a(cid:105)ds = 0,

where Y is the unit conormal and γ a unit speed parameterization of the boundary curve, and
a is any constant vector in R3. The ﬂux formula can be proved ([13]) by observing that the
1-form (H f + N)× d f is closed if f has constant mean curvature H. This formula differs
from the integral formula (1), as it does not depend on the topology of Σ and does not relate
to any conformal structure.
For the special case that ∂Σ is a circle γ(s) = (coss,sins,0), taking a = (0,0,1) allows
one to again obtain the above bounds on H: the surface normal along γ is N = −κnγ + κga
and the conormal is Y = −κgγ − κna. So the ﬂux formula becomes

(cid:90)

(κn − H)

ds
dt

dt = 0.

∂Σ

This is not the same as (1) (and note that the integral in (1) has a priori a different value for
every choice of conformal coordinate), but it does give the same upper and lower bounds on
H for the case of circular boundary.

REMARKS ON THE BOUNDARY CURVE OF A CONSTANT MEAN CURVATURE TOPOLOGICAL DISC

Note that the holomorphicity of the Hopf differential is used in [1] to prove that a stable
CMC topological disc with circular boundar must be a spherical cap, and in [16] to give a
condition for the instability of a higher genus CMC surface with circular boundary.

3.2. Application to capillary surfaces. If M is a CMC surface with boundary ∂ M, and
the boundary curve γ lies in another surface S (the support surface), such that the surfaces
intersect with constant contact angle along γ, then M is called a capillary surface. If M
is a topological disc, then this is a model for the surface of a drop of liquid resting on a
solid surface in the absence of gravity. The contact angle depends on the physical properties
of the solid (hydrophilic/hydrophobic). Two examples are shown to the right in Figure 1,
each constructed by adding a ruled support surface with a prescribed contact angle to the
boundary of a CMC surface.

It is known that if the support surface is part of a plane or a sphere then a capillary
surface with disc topology is necessarily totally umibilic [15, 6, 4]. This follows directly
from Theorem 1, because any curve in a sphere or plane is a line of curvature (zero geodesic
torsion) and the Terquem-Joachimsthal theorem [17] states that if the intersection of two
surfaces M1 and M2 is a line of curvature on M1, then it is also a line of curvature on M2 if
and only if the surfaces intersect at constant angle.

FIGURE 1. Left: this CMC surface cannot meet a plane with constant con-
tact angle because it is not a spherical cap. Middle, right: capillary surfaces
with contact angle π/2. The surface to the right is part of a sphere, so the
intersection curve is necessarily a line of curvature in the support surface.

To state the consequence just mentioned in full generality, one can extend the Terquem-

Joachimsthal theorem to curves that are not necessarily lines of curvature:
Lemma 2. Suppose that a surface M1 meets a surface M2 along a regular curve γ. Denote
by τg, j the geodesic torsion of γ with respect to the surface Mj. Then the surfaces meet at
constant angle if and only if τg,1 = τg,2.
Proof. Assume γ is parameterized by arc-length. Let Nj and Yj = Nj × γ(cid:48) denote the unit
normal and co-normal along γ with respect to the surface Mj. Then (cid:104)Y1,N2(cid:105) = sin(θ ) =
−(cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105), where θ is the angle from N1 to N2. Thus,

(cid:104)N1,N2(cid:105)(cid:48) = −τg,1(cid:104)Y1,N2(cid:105)− τg,2(cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105)

= (τg,1 − τg,2)(cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105).

If θ is constant, i.e., (cid:104)N1,N2(cid:105)(cid:48) ≡ 0, then the product (τg,1 − τg,2)(cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105) is zero. Then either
τg,1 ≡ τg,2 or (cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105) vanishes at some point; but if the latter occurs then (cid:104)Y2,N1(cid:105) = −sinθ ≡
0, because θ is constant, and hence N1 ≡±N2, and τg,1 ≡ τg,2. The converse is also clear. (cid:3)

Together with Theorem 1, this implies

Theorem 3. Let M be a closed topological disc, immersed as a capillary surface with
support surface S and analytic boundary. Let γ denote the boundary curve of M. Then M is
totally umbilic if and only if γ has constant geodesic torsion in the support surface S. In this
case, the geodesic torsion is zero.
