M-CURVES AND SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS

INDRANIL BISWAS AND SHANE D’MELLO

Abstract. Let (X , σ) be a geometrically irreducible smooth projective M-curve of
genus g deﬁned over the ﬁeld of real numbers. We prove that the n–th symmetric
product of (X , σ) is an M-variety for n = 2 , 3 and n ≥ 2g − 1.

1. Introduction

A nonsingular geometrically irreducible real projective curve is a pair (X , σ), where
X is a compact connected Riemann surface and σ is an anti-holomorphic involution
of X. The ﬁxed point set of this σ is called the real part of X and it is denoted by
X σ; topologically, the subset X σ is a disjoint union of circles. Harnack proved that the
number of components of X σ is bounded above by g + 1, where g is the genus of X [Ha].
Curves which have exactly the maximum number (i.e., genus +1) of components of the
real part are called M-curves. Classifying real algebraic curves up to homeomorphism is
straightforward, however, classifying even planar non-singular real algebraic curves up to
isotopy in RP2 has only been completely successful up to degree 7 [Vi, Wi, Ro]. The
M-curves play a special role in this classiﬁcation; a lot of research has been done on M-
curves (see [Chi, She, Mi, Ko, Shu]). In the case of planar curves, many restrictions on
the topology of M-curves are known (see [Fi, Ni]) and have helped in the rigid isotopy
classiﬁcation for low degrees [Gu].

The notion of an M-curve can be generalized to higher dimensional non-singular real
algebraic varieties. For this, consider a non-singular real algebraic variety (Y , η), where
η is an anti-holomorphic involution of a smooth complex projective variety Y . As before,
the ﬁxed-point locus Y η is called the real part of (Y , η). The following inequality is a
generalization of Harnack’s bound [Wi, p. 72, Corollary A.2] [Th, Br]:

X
i≥0

dim Hi(Y η, Z/2Z) ≤ X

i≥0

dim Hi(Y, Z/2Z) .

The pair (Y , η) is called an M-variety if the inequality in (1) is an equality (see [BMMV]).

Since M-curves play a special role in the topology of real algebraic varieties, it is useful
to have a criterion for M-curves. It was proved earlier that a curve deﬁned over R is an
M-curve if and only if its Jacobian is an M-variety [BD]. We use this result of [BD] and
the Picard bundle to prove that the n–th symmetric product (the deﬁnition is recalled

later) of an M-curve of genus g is also an M-variety as long as n ≥ 2g − 1. Although
we cannot use the Picard bundle when n < 2g − 1, by analyzing the topology of the
symmetric product, we are able to prove that for n ≤ 3, the result still holds for all g.
The problem remains open for 4 ≤ n ≤ 2g − 2.

2. Second and third symmetric products

Unless stated otherwise, all homologies will be considered with coeﬃcients in Z/2Z.
Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus g. For any d ≥ 1, the
symmetric product Symd(X) is the quotient of X d by the natural action of permutations
of {1 ,· · · , d}.
Lemma 2.1.

(1) The sum Pi≥0 dim Hi(Sym2(X); Z/2Z) is 3 + 3g + 2g2.
(2) The sum Pi≥0 dim Hi(Sym3(X); Z/2Z) is 4 + 14g/3 + 2g2 + 4g3/3.

Proof. The Poincar´e polynomial (homology with coeﬃcients in Q) of the n-th symmetric
product of a topological space, whose i-th Betti numbers is Bi, is the coeﬃcient of tn
in the power series expansion of [Ma1, p. 568, (8.5)] (here x is the indeterminate of the
Poincar´e polynomial):

(1 + xt)B1(1 + x3t)B3 . . .

(1 − t)B0(1 − x2t)B2(1 − x4t)B4 . . .

For X we have B0 = B2 = 1, B1 = 2g and Bi = 0 for all i ≥ 2. Therefore, the

Poincar´e polynomial of Symn(X) is the coeﬃcient of tn in

Setting x = 1, the sum of the Betti numbers of Symk(X) is the coeﬃcient of tk in (3),

(1 + xt)2g

(1 − t)(1 − x2t)

.

(3)

so it is

(1 + t)2g

(1 − t)(1 − t)
(1 + 2gt + g(2g − 1)t2 +

(1 + t)2g

=

(1 − t)2 = (1 + t)2g(1 − t)−2 =

2g(2g − 2)(2g − 3)

3!

Therefore, the sum of the Betti numbers of Sym2(X) is

while the sum of the Betti numbers of Sym3(X) is

3 + 3g + 2g2 ,

4 + 14g/3 + 2g2 + 4g3/3 .

t3 + . . .)(1 + 2t + 3t2 + 4t3 + . . .) .

The homology of Symn(X), with coeﬃcients in Z, is torsion-free [Ma2, p. 329, (12.3)],

so by the universal coeﬃcient theorem

Hi(X; Z/2Z) = Hi(X; Z) ⊗ Z/2Z and Hi(X; Q) = Hi(X Z) ⊗ Q .

M-CURVES AND SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS

Therefore, the sums of the Betti numbers of Sym2(X) and Sym3(X) with Z/2Z coeﬃcients
are the same as in equations (5) and (6) respectively.

Assume that X admits an anti-holomorphic involution

For any d ≥ 1, let σd : Symd(X) −→ Symd(X) be the anti-holomorphic involution
deﬁned by

σ : X −→ X .

in particular, σ1 = σ.

We will need the following lemma for the next proposition.

Lemma 2.2. The symmetric product Sym2(RP1) is homeomorphic to a M¨obius band.
The boundary of Sym2(RP1) is the diagonal of Sym2(RP1).

Proof. Consider the subspace of Sym2(CP1) which is invariant under the complex conju-
gation. The complement, in it, of the subspace of distinct conjugate pairs is identiﬁed
with Sym2(RP1). The subspace of Sym2(CP1) which is invariant under the complex con-
jugation can be realized as the space of roots of real polynomials, and therefore can be
identiﬁed as the space of real quadratic polynomials, up to scalar multiplication and there-
fore is RP2. The discriminant is a conic in this copy of RP2 and divides it into a disc and a
M¨obius band. The subspace of conjugate pairs is naturally isomorphic to the component
of CP1 \ RP1, which is a disc. Therefore, Sym2(RP1) is the projective plane minus a disc
which is a M¨obius band. Note that the boundary consists of the discriminant conic which
corresponds to the space of repeated roots, which is the diagonal of Sym2(RP1).
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.3. If (X , σ) is an M-curve, then (Sym2(X) , σ2) is an M-variety.

Proof. Let X σ ⊂ X be the subset ﬁxed by σ. Assume that (X , σ) is an M-curve, so
X σ is a disjoint union ⊔g+1
i=1 Ci of g + 1 circles. Note that the Euler characteristic of
χ(X \ X σ) = χ(X) = 2 − 2g because X σ is the union of the circles Ci. Suppose X \ X σ
is connected, note that its closure has 2(g + 1) boundary components. After gluing a disc
to each boundary component of X \ X σ, one obtains a connected surface whose Euler
characteristic is 2 − 2g + 2(1 + g) = 4 which is impossible for a closed surface. Therefore,
the complement X \ X σ has two connected components X1 and X2 that are interchanged
by σ, and X σ is the boundary of both X1 and X2.

The real part of Sym2(X) is the disjoint union of the following:

(1) {(z , z) | z ∈ X1} ∪ {(λ , µ) | λ , µ ∈ Ci}, glued along {(λ , λ) | λ ∈ Ci}. Using
the previous lemma, this is homeomorphic to the space X1 with a M¨obius band
attached along each component of the boundary. Note that Sym2(Ci) is a M¨obius
band because Ci is homeomorphic to RP1.

(2) {(λ , µ) | λ ∈ Ci, µ ∈ Cj, i 6= j}; it is a disjoint union of (cid:0)g+1

2 (cid:1) tori S1 × S1.

4

I. BISWAS AND S. D’MELLO

Denote by Y the space X1 with a M¨obius band glued at each component of its boundary.
The ﬁxed point locus Sym2(X)σ2 is isomorphic to the disjoint union of Y and (cid:0)g+1
2 (cid:1) tori.
The sum of the Betti numbers of (cid:0)g+1

2 (cid:1) = 2g(g + 1).

2 (cid:1) tori is 4 · (cid:0)g+1

Note that the 0-th and 2-nd Betti numbers of Y are 1 since we are considering homology
with Z/2Z coeﬃcients. Therefore, the sum of Betti numbers of Y is 4 − χ(Y ). The Euler
characteristic χ(Y ) = χ(X)/2 = 1 − g because X σ, being a union of circles, has Euler
characteristic 0 and the Euler characteristic of the two halves X1 and X2 are the same;
the Euler characteristic of a M¨obius band is 0. Therefore, 4− χ(Y ) = 4− (1− g) = 3 + g.
Therefore, the sum of the Betti numbers of Sym2(X)σ2 is 2g(g + 1) + 3 + g = 3 + 3g + 2g2.
Now the proposition follows from Lemma 2.1(1).
(cid:3)

In the following theorem, we treat S1 as the subspace of complex numbers with unit

norm. It has a group structure under complex multiplication.

Theorem 2.4.

bundle over S1 with ﬁber homeomorphic to a two simplex.

(1) θ : Sym3(S1) −→ S1, where θ(λ1, λ2, λ3) = λ1λ2λ3, is a ﬁber
(2) The ﬁber θ−1(µ) has boundary {(λ1, λ1, λ2) | λ1, λ2 ∈ S1, λ1λ1λ2 = µ} ∼= S1. The

boundary of Sym3(S1) is the space {(λ1, λ1, λ2) | λ1, λ2 ∈ S1} ∼= S1 × S1.

The proof of (1) is a special case of the proof in [Mo], and is based on the version of

the proof described in [St]. We recall the proof in order to describe the boundary.

Proof. Any point µ of S1 is contained in a locally trivial neighborhood: For the neighbor-
hood U := {µe2π√−1s | s ∈ (− 1
2 , 1
2 )} ∋ µ, the map ψ : U × θ−1(µ) −→ θ−1(U) given by
ψ(µe2π√−1s, (λ1, λ2, λ3)) = (λ1e2π√−1s/3, λ2e2π√−1s/3, λ3e2π√−1s/3) is clearly a local trivial-
ization.

We will now show that the ﬁber θ−1(1) is homeomorphic to the standard 2-simplex

via the map

∆2 := {(d1, d2) | di ∈ [0, 1], d1 + d2 ≤ 1}

) ∈ S1 (note
that λ was chosen so that λλe2π√−1d1λe2π√−1(d1+d2) = 1, to ensure that the image of t lies
in θ−1(1)). Explicitly, t(d1, d2) := (e−2π√−1( 2d1+d2

Given (λ1, λ2, λ3) ∈ Sym3(S1), while there are several triples (s1, s2, s3) ∈ R3, such that
s1 ≤ s2 ≤ s3 ≤ s1 + 1, e2π√−1s1 = λi, e2π√−1s2 = λj, and e2π√−1s3 = λk where i 6= j 6= k,

only one triple also satisﬁes s1 + s2 + s3 = 0, which is a necessary condition to deﬁne the
inverse, owing to the last sentence in the previous paragraph. We will prove that this
condition is also suﬃcient to ensure that the map t′((λ1, λ2, λ3)) = (s2 − s1, s3 − s2) is the
inverse of t.

R covers the circle via the map s 7−→ e2π√−1s so we can pick (s1, s2, s3) ∈ R3, such
that s1 ≤ s2 ≤ s3 ≤ s1 + 1, e2π√−1s1 = λ1, e2π√−1s2 = λ2, and e2π√−1s3 = λ3 by lifting
along the path that begins at λ1 and wraps around the circle once. Since λ1λ2λ3 = 1,
s1 + s2 + s3 ∈ Z. Deﬁne T (s1, s2, s3) = (s2, s3, s1 + 1), then (s′2, s′3, s′1) = T (s1, s2, s3) also
satisﬁes s′2 ≤ s′3 ≤ s′1 ≤ s′1 + 1, e2π√−1s′

s′k ≤ s′i + 1, e2π√−1s′
k = λk, i 6= j 6= k 6= i, but
the sums s′i + s′j + s′k are all distinct and they span all of Z. Therefore there exists a
unique (s′1, s′2, s′3) ∈ {T n(s1, s2, s3) | n ∈ Z} that sum to 0 and the map t′((λ1, λ2, λ3)) =

It is easy to check that t′ is an inverse of t. Indeed, t ◦ t′(λ1, λ2, λ3) = t(s′2 − s′1, s′3 −

Lemma 2.5. Let X1 be one half of X \ X σ. Then Sym3(X)σ3 is the disjoint union of
(cid:0)g+1
3 (cid:1) copies of the set S1 × S1 × S1 and the connected sets Bi, i = 1 . . . g + 1, where each
Bi is constructed as follows: S1 × X1 has g + 1 disjoint copies of S1 × S1 in the boundary;
to the ith boundary, glue Sym3(S1) (which also has boundary S1 × S1) and to each of
the other g boundaries glue S1 × M (which also has S1 × S1 as its boundary) where
M is a M¨obius band (the precise gluings will be described in the proof ). Furthermore,
H1(Bi; Z/2Z) ∼= H1(S1 × X1; Z/2Z) for each i.
Proof. Denote the ith boundary component of X1 by Ci. The space Sym3(X)σ3 consists
of elements of the form {(λ1 , λ2 , λ3) | λi ∈ X σ} or {(λ , z , ¯z) | λ ∈ X σ, z ∈ X \ X σ}.
The latter is clearly homeomorphic to the disjoint union of Y i
0 := {(λ , z , ¯z) | λ ∈ Ci, z ∈
X \ X σ} = Ci × X1 ∼= S1 × X1 (see Proposition 2.3). The former consists of spaces of
three forms:

3 (cid:1) copies of it and they are clearly disjoint.

(1) {(λ1 , λ2 , λ3) | λ1 ∈ Ci, λ2 ∈ Cj, λ3 ∈ Ck, i 6= j 6= k}. This space is Ci× Cj × Ck ∼=
S1 × S1 × S1. There are (cid:0)g+1
(2) {(λ1 , λ2 , λ3) | λ1 ∈ Ci, λ2, λ3 ∈ Cj, i 6= j}. This space is Ci × Sym2(Cj) ∼=
S1 × M, where M is the M¨obius band. Note that the boundary of this space is
{(λ1 , λ2 , λ2) | λ1 ∈ Ci, λ2 ∈ Cj, i 6= j} and it lies in the closure and therefore the
same component of Ci × X1.

6

I. BISWAS AND S. D’MELLO

(3) {(λ1 , λ2 , λ3) | λ1, λ2, λ3 ∈ Ci}. This space is Sym3(Ci) ∼= Sym3(S1). Its boundary
is {(λ1 , λ2 , λ2) | λ1, λ2 ∈ Ci}, which is also in the closure and therefore the same
component of Ci × X1.

We claim that

H1(Y i
for all i 6= j. Note that Y i
S1 × S1. Consider the reduced homology version of the Mayer Vietoris sequence,
. . . −→ eH1(S1×S1) −→ eH1(Y i

0 ∪ Ci × Sym2(Cj); Z/2Z) ∼= H1(Y i

which simpliﬁes to,

θ−→ eH1(S1 × X1) ⊕ (Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z) −→ eH1(Z) −→ 0

0 ∪ Ci × Sym2(Cj).

where Z = Y i
Let [A1] and [A2] be the generators of eH1(S1 × S1) = Z/2Z⊕ Z/2Z, represented by the
curves A1 = {(λ1 , 1 , 1) | λ1 ∈ Ci, 1 ∈ Cj} and A2 = {(1 , λ2 , λ2) | 1 ∈ Ci, λ2 ∈ Cj}.
Note that A1 and A2 are not boundaries in S1 × X1 because X1 has more than one
boundary component, however, A2 is twice a generator in S1 × Sym2(Cj) ∼= S1 × M,
where M is the M¨obius band, and is therefore 0 (since the coeﬃcient is Z/2Z). Therefore,

[A1] θ−→ ([A1], [A1])
[A2] θ−→ ([A2], 0)

Therefore, the image of θ is Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z, from which it follows that H1(Y i

0 ∪ Ci ×

Sym2(Cj); Z/2Z) ∼= H1(Y i

0 ; Z/2Z). This proves the claim.

Following exactly the same proof, one can prove that taking the union of Y i

0 with all
spaces Ci × Sym2(Cj), j 6= i, does not change the ﬁrst homology. Denote the resulting
space by Y i. The boundary of Y i is Ci × Ci.

We now claim that

H1(Y i ∪ Sym3(Ci); Z/2Z) ∼= H1(Y i; Z/2Z) .

Note that Y i ∩ Sym3(Ci) = {(λ1 , λ2 , λ2) | λ1, λ2 ∈ Ci} ∼= S1 × S1. Consider the Mayer
Vietoris sequence,

. . . −→ eH1(S1 × S1) −→ eH1(Y i) ⊕ eH1(Sym3(Ci)) −→ eH1(Y i ∪ Sym3(Ci)) −→ 0

which simpliﬁes to

. . . −→ Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z

θ−→ eH1(Y i) ⊕ Z/2Z −→ eH1(Y i ∪ D2 × S1) −→ 0

Let [A1] and [A2] be the generators of eH1(S1 × S1) = Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z, represented by
A1 := {(λ, λ, 1) | λ ∈ S1} and A2 := {(1, 1, λ) | λ ∈ S1}. Let us consider the curves
A′1 := {(λ, λ, µ) | λ, µ ∈ Ci, λ2µ = 1} and A′2 := {(1, 1, λ) | λ ∈ S1} in Sym3(Ci). By
theorem 2.4, A′1 is the boundary of a ﬁber and therefore homologous to zero, whereas A′2

M-CURVES AND SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS

7

is a section of the ﬁber bundle θ : Sym3(S1) −→ S1, and therefore [A′2] generates the ﬁrst
homology of Sym3(Ci). Note that [A′1] and [A′2] are generators of the ﬁrst homology of the
boundary of Sym3(Ci). Let the image of A1 in the boundary of Sym3(S1) represent the
homology class a[A′1]+b[A′2]. The coeﬃcients can be determined by the mod 2 intersection
number with A′1 and A′2: A1 intersects A′2 in one point, namely (1, 1, 1), therefore a = 1;
A1 intersects A′1 in two points, namely {(λ, λ, 1) | λ2 = 1} = {(1, 1, 1), (−1,−1, 1)},
therefore the intersection number mod 2 is 0 and b = 0. Therefore, the image of A1 in the
boundary of Sym3(S1) represents the homology class [A′1] which in the solid torus is 0.
On the other hand, A2 = A′2, by deﬁnition. Now the image of A1 in Y i is the boundary
and therefore homologous to 0, whereas the image of A2 in Y i represents a generator of
the ﬁrst homology. Therefore,

[A1] θ−→ (0, 0)

[A2] θ−→ ([A2], [A′2])

Therefore, the image of θ is Z/2Z and eH1(Y i) ∼= eH1(Y i ∪ Sym3(Ci)).

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.6. The sum of the Betti numbers of each Bi is 2(g + 2).

Proof. We already know, by computing the Euler characteristic, that H1(X1; Z/2Z) =
(Z/2Z)g. By the K¨unneth formula, we have that H1(S1 × X1; Z/2Z) = (Z/2Z)g+1.
By the previous lemma, H1(Bi; Z/2Z) ∼= H1(S1 × X1; Z/2Z) = (Z/2Z)g+1. Finally,
by the Poincar´e duality coupled with the universal coeﬃcient theorem of cohomology,
H2(Bi; Z/2Z) = H1(Bi; Z/2Z). Since Bi is a compact manifold without boundary, the
sum of the Betti numbers is 1 + (g + 1) + (g + 1) + 1 = 2(g + 2)
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.7. Let (X , σ) be an M-curve. Then (Sym3(X) , σ3) is an M-variety.
Proof. By lemma 2.5, Sym3(X)σ3 has (cid:0)g+1

3 (cid:1) components, disjoint copies of S1 × S1 × S1,

each of which has the sum of Betti numbers 8. Since the sum of the Betti numbers of
each Bi is 2(g + 2) and there are g + 1 of them, the total sum of the Betti numbers is
8(cid:0)g+1

3 (cid:1) + (g + 1)2(g + 2).

Now the proposition follows from Lemma 2.1(1).

(cid:3)

3. Picard bundles and higher symmetric powers

Theorem 3.1. Let (X , σ) be an M-curve of genus g. For any n ≥ 2g− 1, the symmetric
product (Symn(X) , σn) is also an M-variety.

Proof. Note that if the real part of (X , σ) is empty, it cannot be an M-curve. Therefore,
in what follows, we will assume that the real part of (X , σ) is non-empty.

Fix a point p ∈ X σ. Take any n ≥ 2g − 1. Consider the map

u : Symn(X) −→ Pic0(X)

(7)

8

I. BISWAS AND S. D’MELLO

deﬁned by u((x1 , x2 , . . . , xn)) = OX (Pn
i=1(xi − p)). The map u is surjective. Indeed,
for any L ∈ Pic0(X), the line bundle L ⊗ OX(np) admits nonzero holomorphic sections
because by Riemann–Roch,

dim H 0(X, L ⊗ OX (np)) − dim H 1(X, L ⊗ OX(np)) = n − g + 1 > 0 .

Therefore, if s is a nonzero holomorphic section of L ⊗ OX(np), then we have

L = u(divisor(s)) .

Hence u is surjective. The ﬁber of u over L is the space of eﬀective divisors on X of degree
n linearly equivalent to L ⊗ OX (np). Using Serre duality,

H 1(X, L ⊗ OX (np)) = H 0(X, L∗ ⊗ OX(−np) ⊗ KX)∗ = 0

because

degree(L∗ ⊗ OX (−np) ⊗ KX ) = −n + 2g − 2 < 0 .

Hence by Riemann–Roch, we have

dim H 0(X, L ⊗ OX (np)) = n − g + 1 .

Therefore, u makes Symn(X) a projective bundle over Pic0(X) of relative dimension n−g;
see [ACGH, Ch. IV, § 3] for more details.

Let

σ∗ : Pic0(X) −→ Pic0(X) , OX (D) 7−→ OX (σ(D))

be the anti-holomorphic involution given by σ. Note that for a meromorphic function
f on X, we have σ(divisor(f )) = divisor(f ◦ σ). Therefore, σ∗ is well-deﬁned, and σn
takes ﬁbers of the map u in (7) to ﬁbers of u. We now prove that the restriction of u to
Symn(X)σn surjects onto Pic0(X)σ∗.

Take any OX(D) ∈ Pic0(X)σ∗. Since the real part of the curve is non-empty, the line
bundle OX (D) cannot have a quaternionic structure [BHH, p. 206, Propositon 3.1 and
p. 210, § 4.2], [BB] (there are no quaternionic bundles of odd rank on X because X σ is
nonempty). Therefore, the line bundle OX(D) has a real structure, i.e., there is a lift eσ
of σ to OX (D) such that eσ ◦eσ is the identity map of OX (D), and eσ is ﬁberwise conjugate
linear. For any holomorphic section s of OX (D + n.p), the section ϕ(s) := s + eσ(s) is
clearly ﬁxed by eσ.
We will show that there is a holomorphic section s such that ϕ(s) 6= 0. For this, ﬁrst

note that the homomorphism

H 0(X, OX (D + n.p)) −→ H 0(X, OX(D + n.p)) , s 7−→ eσ(s)

is conjugate linear. Hence if s′ is a nonzero holomorphic section such that ϕ(s′) =

s′ + eσ(s′) = 0, then
So ϕ(√−1s′) 6= 0 because s′

6= 0.

ϕ(√−1s′) = √−1s′ + eσ(√−1s′) = √−1s′ − √−1eσ(s′) = 2√−1s′ .

M-CURVES AND SYMMETRIC PRODUCTS

Take any s ∈ H 0(X, OX (D + n.p)) such that ϕ(s) 6= 0. Therefore, Ds := divisor(s)

is an element of Symn(X)σn such that u(Ds) = OX(D) ∈ Pic0(X)σ∗. Hence

(8)

u|Symn(X)σn : Symn(X)σn

−→ Pic0(X)σ∗

is surjective.

Consequently, the map in (8) makes Symn(X)σn a real projective bundle over Pic0(X)σ∗

of ﬁxed relative dimension n − g.

If X is an M-curve, then Pic0(X) is an M-variety [BD, Proposition 2.3]. The complex
projective space with the standard anti-holomorphic involution is also an M-variety. Now
it follows from the Leray–Hirsch theorem that Symn(X) is an M-variety.
