Systems of particles interacting via inverse-power law potentials have an invariance with respect to
changes in length and temperature, implying a correspondence in the dynamics and thermodynamics
between diﬀerent ‘isomorphic’ sets of temperatures and densities. In a recent series of works, it has
been argued that such correspondences hold to a surprisingly good approximation in a much more
general class of potentials, an observation that summarizes many properties that have been observed
in the past. In this paper we show that such relations are exact in high-dimensional liquids and
glasses, a limit in which the conditions for these mappings to hold become transparent. The special
role played by the exponential potential is also conﬁrmed.

We consider a simple liquid at temperature T and num-
ber density ρ. Two state points (T1, ρ1) and (T2, ρ2) are
isomorphic if there is a rescaling of the coordinates of all
particles r2
i that makes their Boltzmann
factors proportional

where C12 depends only upon the state points 1 and 2,
not on the microscopic conﬁgurations. This implies a
certain number of correspondences both in the thermo-
dynamic and dynamic quantities between the two states.
Inverse-power law potentials VIPL(r) ∝ r−n are the only
potentials for which the isomorphic property exactly
holds, for all points lying on curves given by ρn/d/T =
constant, called isomorphs. It is instead only an approx-
imation for all the other potentials, and yet, surprisingly
enough, it turns out [1–6] that there is a wide class of situ-
ations in which it is a very good one. This observation led
to a number of a posteriori explanations and interpreta-
tions of facts that had been previously observed [1, 5, 6],
such as e.g. striking similarities in structure and dynam-
ics of some model liquids [7–9], phenomenological rules
along freezing or melting lines [10–14], or observations
that a single static quantity controls dynamic proper-
ties [15–18]. It can also be used to rule out theories that
are incompatible with these invariances [5], or make novel
predictions [19, 20].

In this paper we show that the existence of isomorphs
in the (T, ρ) plane actually becomes strictly true in the
large-dimensional limit for a wide and well-deﬁned class
of potentials. This holds for the liquid as well as the
glassy regions of the phase diagram. We proceed in three
steps: ﬁrst we show this in detail for the equilibrium
properties of the liquid phase, then we show how the
same manipulations allow one to prove it for the dynam-
ics, and ﬁnally we outline a derivation for the equilibrium

(‘landscape’) properties within the glass phase. The main
argument is the following: ‘soft’ interactions in large di-
mensions are such that particles that are too close are
exponentially few in number, while those that are too far
interact exponentially weakly: all in all there is a typical
distance (to within 1/d) where interactions are relevant.

A. High-dimensional liquids

We wish to focus on the large d behaviour of a system
of N particles interacting via a pair potential V (|rij|). In
order to have a well-deﬁned large-dimensional limit, we
shall assume that the potential scales as

V (r) = e−dA(r)

(2)

The precise conditions on V (r) will be derived below.

For large d only the ﬁrst two terms of the virial expan-
sion contribute; the free energy and the pressure of the
liquid are respectively given by [21–25]

with (cid:101)β deﬁned in (5) and Vd(σ) = Ωdσd/d is the d-

dimensional volume of the sphere of diameter σ. We
have expanded A(r) around r∗ and kept non-vanishing
orders when d goes to inﬁnity. This development only
makes sense if

A(cid:48)(r∗) >

r∗ ,

(7)

which ensures the convergence of the integral, and in this
case only a range of values around r∗ of width O(1/d)
contributes, a crucial fact.
• r > r∗. These may give a further contribution. Here,
we have lim
d→∞f (r) = 0 and one can expand the Mayer
function as f (r) ∼ −βV (r). A saddle point evaluation of
the Mayer integral in this region is possible, obtained by
maximizing the exponent ln r − A(r) in a point rsp given
by (see region (B) in Figure 1):

A(cid:48)(rsp) =

√
As usual, the ﬂuctuations around this saddle-point are of
order 1/

d.

At each density and temperature, it may be the case
that for large d the integral is dominated either by the
region around r∗, the region around a saddle point rsp
or by r → ∞. The latter case corresponds to long-range
potentials, and we shall not consider it here. If condition
(7) is satisﬁed, the contribution around r∗ is well deﬁned.
The question remains if there exists some saddle point
value rsp, i.e. if (8) deﬁnes an absolute maximum of the
potential for r > r∗, that dominates. Assume that there
is such a value, and let us compare the contributions

which amounts to saying that ln r − A(r) is a monotoni-
cally decreasing function for r (cid:62) r∗. We shall concentrate
here in the cases in which this condition holds (‘rather
hard potentials’), we shall not consider the case in which
a typical distance rsp > r∗ dominates (‘very soft spheres’)
– it has never been studied in the high-dimensional limit,
to the best of our knowledge.

the integrand is ∼ −rd, and in large dimensions only the
right boundary r → r∗ dominates.

scaling of the potential in the large d limit, this region has
a O(1/d) extension and, setting r = r∗(1 + ˜r/d), one may
compute the contribution of this region (A), as denoted
in Figure 1, as

1 In the case β = O(1), r∗ is precisely deﬁned by the condition

A(r∗) = 0. This was the case studied in [25, 26].

Let us emphasize here that conditions (7) and (10) are
stated for a given temperature. Some potentials, such as
the pure exponential V (r) = e−adr and the Gaussian one
V (r) = e−adr2/2 have a low-temperature ‘rather hard’
regime where r∗ dominates and a high temperature ‘very
soft’ regime where the discussion in this paper does not

  brrde-βV(r)-1Integrandrr*r*rsprsp(A)(B)0-1apply. A particularly simple situation arises when the po-
tential is such that ln r−A(r) is monotonically decreasing
for all r, then it will be in the ‘rather hard’ regime for
all values of pressure and temperature.

Along these lines, the partition function between two
points scales changes by a purely geometric, model-
independent factor:

3

β2F2 − β1F1 = N ln

ρ2

(17)

as may be easily veriﬁed using the transformations (15) in
(3). This factor is only due to ideal gas contributions; the
excess free energy, which contains all potential-dependent
static properties, is invariant under this transformation,
explaining a number of static discoveries described in [5].
The correspondence is then valid in any phase dia-
gram window where density and temperature are rescaled
even by large factors, provided they are smaller than ex-
ponential in d (i.e. that temperatures are not rescaled
exponentially in d), so that all points have the same
r∗. Note that all reference to the (arbitrary) number

(cid:101)β has disappeared – it only sets the constant that labels

each line, but the lines are the same whatever the choice.
Greater (exponential) changes of parameters modify the
value of r∗, and through it the hardness of the potential
1/α = A(cid:48)(r∗)r∗. This is the case even if one follows the
same curve given by (16), for instance by performing an
exponential compression and heating of the system. The
mappings are in this case only approximate, except for
the case where 1/α = A(cid:48)(r∗)r∗ = constant ∀ r∗, i.e. the
inverse-power law potential.

Note that, generalizing the above relations, one can
map two systems at diﬀerent state points 1 and 2 and
with diﬀerent interaction potentials given by their expo-
nent A1 and A2.
In this case only the ﬁrst condition
in (14) is modiﬁed and reads r∗
2) = 1/α.
The same hardness 1/α will generally imply diﬀerent ef-
fective radii r∗

Isomorphs and eﬀective potential

1/α ≡ r∗A(cid:48)(r∗) > 1

(12)

The term e˜r, related to the linear part of the eﬀective
potential in [25, 26],

is an entropic ‘driving force’, (cid:101)β
is an eﬀective inverse temperature and (cid:101)ϕ an eﬀective

packing fraction. We have discovered naturally that
the eﬀective potential is a pure decaying exponential
Veﬀ (r) = V (r∗) exp(−r∗A(cid:48)(r∗)˜r) = V (r∗) exp(−˜r/α)
similar to the ‘building blocks’ of Dyre, Schrøder et
al [1, 27]. The value α gives its ‘hardness’ and depends
upon the value of r∗ and the original potential through
A(cid:48).

We now show under which conditions two systems at
diﬀerent state points are related through a scaling trans-
formation. If one shifts in the virial term of equation (11)
˜r → ˜r + c, which corresponds to an order 1/d shift of r∗,
one gets

The dynamical equations, exact in the limit of high
dimensions, have been recently derived [25, 26]. It turns
out that, as is usual in all large d computations, the
system breaks down into the dynamics of a single de-
gree of freedom ˜r(t) with colored noise ξ and friction

that have to be derived self-consistently.

We deﬁne the potential centered around r∗ as ¯V (˜r) =
V [r∗(1 + ˜r/d)]. Similarly to the statics, the average rela-
tive distance between nearest neighbours turns out to be
r(t) = r∗(1 + ˜r(t)/d). For equilibrium dynamics, where
the initial condition at t0 is picked with the canonical
equilibrium probability, the self-consistent equations for

ﬁnite times t may be written as [25, 26]:

β2M (t − t(cid:48)) = (cid:101)ϕ
where (cid:98)m = (r∗)2m/2d2 and (cid:98)γ = (r∗)2γ/2d2, m being

(18)

For the purely Newtonian case, we adimensionalize

the physical mass and γ the coupling to the bath.
If
we set γ = 0 we have the purely Newtonian case, and
with m = 0 the overdamped Brownian case. Out-of-
equilibrium dynamics may also be considered (see next
section).

these equations by setting ˜t = t/(cid:112)(cid:98)mβ. We expand as
before the potentials around r∗ as βV (cid:0)r∗[1 + ˜r(t)/d](cid:1) =
(cid:101)βe−˜r(t)/α, and get:

e.g. (cid:102)M (˜t) = β2M (˜t(cid:112)(cid:98)mβ) (nevertheless we kept the same

symbol for ˜r to simplify the notation). Now, performing
the shift ˜r(t) → ˜r(t) + c, ∀t, we ﬁnd exactly the same
rescalings of parameters as in the static liquid phase
computations, and once again the isomorphs are given
by (16).

For the purely Brownian case, we instead adimension-

alize these equations by setting ˜t = t/β(cid:98)γ, rescale the
variables in the new time units, e.g. (cid:102)M (˜t) = β2M (˜tβ(cid:98)γ),

and check that the translation ˜r(t) → ˜r(t) + c has the
same eﬀect as before. Interestingly, for the mixed case
with friction and inertia, isomorphs change the ratio of
inertial to bath intensities.

D. Glassy phases

Glassy phases of particle systems in the regime
considered here have been studied in [25, 28–33]. We
will use the setting of [25, 26], conﬁning the particles in
a ‘box’ consisting in the surface of a d + 1-dimensional
sphere of radius R, very large compared to the inter-
particle distance;
the usual d-dimensional Euclidean
space is recovered when R → ∞. Replacing the eﬀective
hard sphere radius σ in [25] by r∗ here, the repli-
cated free energy is given in terms of a replica matrix
(r∗)2 ra · rb that encodes the distance between the
Qab = 2d
n replicas of a particle r:

before making any ansatz for ˆQ, we may show that a
Expanding each one of the Mayer terms around r∗ as
before, we obtain the same equations as in the static
case studied in Ref [25, 29–32], but with the exponential
potential e−(˜ra+λ)/α. Using the translation λ → λ + c,
we conclude that condition (16) deﬁnes isomorphs in the
glassy region of the phase diagram of the system as well.
The out-of-equilibrium dynamics can be derived along
the same lines as [26], giving similar self-consistent equa-
tions governed by the one-dimensional oﬀ-equilibrium dy-

namics of ˜r(t). The dynamical action bears a formal
analogy with the replicated free energy (20) where re-
spectively time and replica index play a similar role [25],
and once again a shift of λ gives the equation of the same
invariant curves (16).

E. Virial-energy correlations

(cid:80)
In [1, 5] a simple measure of the goodness of scaling
(cid:80)
relations was introduced as follows. The energy U =
i<j V (|ri − rj|) and the so-called virial function [23]
W = − 1
i ri · ∇ri U are used to deﬁne a virial-energy
correlation coeﬃcient R ∈ [−1, 1] as
(cid:104)∆W ∆U(cid:105)

d

(cid:112)(cid:104)(∆W )2(cid:105)(cid:104)(∆U )2(cid:105)

R =

(22)

where ∆W = W − (cid:104)W(cid:105) and brackets denote equilibrium
averages. In the case of inverse-power law potentials, we
have W ∝ U and R = 1.
In any practical case, one
may numerically compute R: a value close to unity is an
indication of good scaling properties [1, 5, 6].

Here one may easily show that R = 1 for large di-
mensions for any potential satisfying the ‘rather hard’
condition. This may be done by computing directly R
through (22), using equilibrium averages truncated at the
lowest order of the virial expansion. To leading order:

(cid:82) dr (rV (cid:48)(r) + dV (r))e−βV (r)

(cid:113)(cid:82) dr r2V (cid:48)(r)2e−βV (r)(cid:82) dr(cid:48) V (r(cid:48))2e−βV (r(cid:48))

R = −

β

(23)
One can check, by the same reasoning as the one used for
the Mayer integral, that these integrals are dominated,
under the previous conditions, by the O(1/d) neighbor-
hood of r∗. Expanding this expression once again around
r∗ gives R = 1. An alternative, quicker way, is to recog-
nize that any potential may be substituted by an inverse-
power law potential VIPL(r) ∝ (r∗/r)d/α once the value
of r∗ is ﬁxed such that 1/α = r∗A(cid:48)(r∗).

5
that βV (r∗) = O(1) one has ln r − A(r) monotonically
decreasing for all r > r∗, then in the large-dimensional
limit the parameter space (T, ρ) is foliated with lines (iso-
morphs), where static and dynamic properties coincide.
The simple explanation of this fact is that, in large di-
mensions, there is a typical interparticle distance that
dominates the physics: larger distances have weak inter-
actions, shorter distances are too rare. The arguments
hold for dynamic as well as equilibrium calculations, both
in the liquid and in the glass phase. Transition and dy-
namical crossover lines follow these isomorphs.

There is numerical evidence that in d = 2, 3 and 4
in Lennard-Jones systems, both the virial-energy corre-
lation coeﬃcient R approaches quickly 1 and scale invari-
ances become increasingly good with increasing dimen-
sion [34], which is to be expected on the basis of this
work.

One may interpret the fact that in ﬁnite dimensions the
scaling properties hold to a good approximation [1, 5, 6]
as a symptom of the high-dimensional approximation be-
ing qualitatively good. Note that this approximation is
intimately tied to the Random First-Order Transition
scenario for dense liquids [35–42], so this is another in-
stance in which we are confronted with a unifying per-
spective.
