ON STABILITY OF N -TIMES INTEGRATED

SEMIGROUPS WITH NONQUASIANALYTIC GROWTH

JOS´E E. GAL´E, MAR´IA M. MART´INEZ AND PEDRO J. MIANA

Abstract. We discuss the behaviour at inﬁnity of n-times in-
tegrated semigroups with nonquasianalytic growth and invertible
generator. The results obtained extend in this setting a theorem
of O. El Mennaoui on stability of bounded once integrated semi-
groups, and (partially) a theorem of Q. P. V˜u on stability of C0-
semigroups.

1. Introduction

Let A be a closed operator on a Banach space X with domain D(A).

The solution u : [0, ∞) → X of the Cauchy equation

u′(t) = Au(t), t ≥ 0;

u(0) = x ∈ D(A)

(1)
is given by u(t) = T0(t)x where T0(t) := etA, t ≥ 0, is the C0-semigroup
generated by A, provided A satisﬁes the Hille-Yosida condition; see
[2, Section 3.1]. There still are other important cases where A does
not satisfy that condition but it is the generator of an exponentially
bounded n-times integrated semigroup in the following sense:

There exist a family (Tn(t))t≥0 of bounded operators on X and

C, w ≥ 0 such that kTn(t)k ≤ Cewt, t ≥ 0, and

(λ − A)−1x = λnZ ∞

0

e−tλTn(t)x dt, ℜλ > w,

x ∈ X.

Every C0-semigroup is a 0-times integrated semigroup; for more infor-
mation on integrated semigroups and examples see [2, Sections 3.2 and
8.3], [3] and references therein.

reﬂects the asymptotic behaviour of the solution u at inﬁnity. In this
respect, when n = 0, a uniformly bounded C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 is
said to be stable if

lim
t→∞

T0(t)x = 0,

x ∈ X.

The stability of uniformly bounded C0-semigroups on Banach spaces,
under certain spectral assumptions on their inﬁnitesimal generators,
is proven in [1] and [8], with diﬀerent proofs and independently one
from each other. We refer to this stability result as the Arendt-Batty-
Lyubich-V˜u theorem. It states that (T0(t))t≥0 is stable whenever

σ(A) ∩ iR is countable and σP (A∗) ∩ iR = ∅.

Here σ(A) is the spectrum of the generator A and σP (A∗) is the point
spectrum of the adjoint operator A∗ of A. For the asymptotic behaviour
and stability of operator semigroups we refer the reader to [4] and [9].
It seems interesting to have a result like the Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-
V˜u theorem for n-times integrated semigroups. In this setting, a notion
of stability has been deﬁned for once integrated semigroups as follows.
Suppose that (T0(t))t≥0 is a C0-semigroup and let (T1(t))t≥0 denote the
(trivial, say) once integrated semigroup induced by (T0(t))t≥0, which is
deﬁned by

T1(t)x :=Z t

0

T0(s)x ds,

x ∈ X.

By a well known property of C0-semigroups,

T0(t)x − x = AT1(t)x(= T1(t)Ax),

for x ∈ D(A).

Assume in addition that the C0-semigroup (T0(t))t≥0 is stable. Then,
provided A is invertible, one gets that there exists the limit

lim
t→∞

T1(t)x = −A−1x,

x ∈ D(A).

Motivated by this observation, a (nontrivial) general once integrated
semigroup T1(t) is called stable in [5, p. 363] when limt→∞ T1(t)x exists
for every x ∈ D(A). Moreover, it is also shown in [5, Prop. 5.1]
that if a once integrated semigroup T1(t) is stable in the sense of that
deﬁnition then A must be invertible, which is to say that 0 belongs to
the resolvent set ρ(A) of A. The following result is [5, Theorem 5.6].
It gives a version of the Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-V˜u theorem for once
integrated semigroups.

Theorem 1.1. Let A be the generator of a once integrated semigroup
(T1(t))t≥0 such that supt>0 kT1(t)k < +∞. Assume in addition that
σ(A) ∩ iR is countable, σP (A∗) ∩ iR = ∅ and 0 ∈ ρ(A). Then (T1(t))t≥0
is stable.

The boundedness condition assumed on (T1(t))t≥0 in Theorem 1.1
looks somehow restrictive: For a uniformly bounded C0-semigroup
(T0(t))t≥0 and its n-times integrated semigroup

Tn(t)x =

(t − s)n−1T0(s)x ds,

t > 0, x ∈ X,

1

(n − 1)!Z t

the derived boundedness condition on (Tn(t))t≥0 which is to be expected
from the integral expression is supt>0 t−nkTn(t)k < +∞, so that for
n = 1 is supt>0 t−1kT1(t)k < +∞ instead of boundedness.

The purpose of this note is to extend Theorem 1.1 to n-times inte-
grated semigroups for every natural n and a fairly wide boundedness
condition involving nonquasianalytic weights. We say that a positive
measurable locally bounded function ω with domain R or [0, ∞) is a
weight if ω(t) ≥ 1 and ω(s + t) ≤ ω(s)ω(t) for all t, s in its domain. A
weight ω on [0, ∞) is called nonquasianalytic if

Z ∞

log ω(t)

dt < ∞.

As in [11, Section 1] we assume that lim inf t→∞ ω(t)−1ω(s + t) ≥ 1 for

ω(t + s)

eω(s) := lim sup

all s > 0. Then one can deﬁne the function eω on R given by
, s ≥ 0 , and eω(s) := 1, s < 0,
is a weight function. Clearly, eω(t) ≤ ω(t) for every t ≥ 0.

Our main result is the following. In the statement, and throughout
the paper, the symbol “ ∼ ” in a(t) ∼ b(t) as t → ∞ means that
limt→∞ b(t)−1a(t) = c > 0 as t → ∞.

ω(t)

t→∞

Theorem 1.2. Let A be the generator of a n-times integrated semi-
group (Tn(t))t≥0 such that σ(A) ∩ iR is countable, σP (A∗) ∩ iR = ∅ and
0 ∈ ρ(A). Assume that

ω(t)−1kTn(t)k < +∞,

as t → ∞, for some k ≥ 0.

We have:

(i) If ω(t)−1 = o(t−n+1) as t → ∞, then

ω(t)−1Tn(t)x = 0,

x ∈ D(An).

x ∈ D(An).

Remark 1.1. For n = 1, Theorem 1.2 (ii) is [5, Theorem 5.6]. So
any n-times integrated semigroup (Tn(t))t≥0 satisfying the equality of
Theorem 1.2 (ii) might well be called stable. Alternatively, the ergodic

type equality limt→∞ ω(t)−1Tn(t)x = 0, x ∈ D(An), for ω(t) ∼ tn at
inﬁnity, deﬁnes a property on (Tn(t))t≥0 which corresponds to stability
of C0-semigroups when n = 0. Then one could say that a n-times
integrated semigroup satisfying Theorem 1.2 (i) for ω(t) ∼ tn as t → ∞
is stable of order n, and stable under ω in general.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In order to establish Theorem 1.2 one needs to extend [11, Theorem
7] and [5, Theorem 5.6]. Firstly, and more precisely, Theorem 2.1 below
is an improvement of [11, Theorem 7], which is in turn an extension
of the Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-V˜u theorem. In fact [11, Theorem 7] is
recovered in the particular case that the operator R is the identity
operator in Theorem 2.1. The case β(t) ≡ 1 in Theorem 2.1 appears
in [1, Remark 3.3].

For a Banach space (Y, k · k), let B(Y ) denote the Banach algebra of

bounded operators on Y .

Theorem 2.1. Let (U(t))t≥0 ⊂ B(Y ) be a C0-semigroup of positive
exponential type with generator L. Let β be a nonquasianalytic weight

on [0, ∞) such that eβ(t) = O(tk) as t → ∞, for some k ≥ 0. Assume

that there exists R ∈ B(Y ) such that U(t)R = RU(t) for all t ≥ 0 and
kU(t)Rk ≤ β(t) for t ≥ 0.

If σ(L) ∩ iR is countable and σP (L∗) ∩ iR = ∅ then

lim
t→∞

1

β(t)

U(t)Ry = 0,

y ∈ Y.

Proof. The overall argument goes along similar lines as in [11, Theorem
7], lemmata included. Next, we outline that argument for convenience
of prospective readers and give details, when necessary, to extend the
corresponding assertions to our setting.

Put

q(y) := lim sup

β(t)−1kU(t)Ryk,

y ∈ Y.

t→∞

Then q is a seminorm on Y such that q(y) ≤ kyk for all y ∈ Y .

{y ∈ Y : q(y) = 0} is a U(t)-invariant closed subspace of Y . Hence one

Moreover, q(U(s)y) ≤ eβ(s)q(y) for every s ≥ 0, y ∈ Y , and so N :=
can deﬁne a norm bq on Y /N given by
bq(π(y)) := q(y),
and an operator bU (t) on Y /N given by
bU(t)(π(y)) := π(U(t)y),

y ∈ Y, t ≥ 0,

y ∈ Y,

where π is the projection Y → Y /N.

It is straightforward to show that (bU (t))t≥0 is a strongly continuous
semigroup in the norm bq on Y /N. Let (Z, k · kZ) be the bq-completion

STABILITY OF N -TIMES INTEGRATED SEMIGROUPS

5

t > 0. Then:

(a) kπ(y)kZ = lim supt→∞

of Y /N, and let V (t) be the continuous extension on Z of bU(t) for all
(b) kV (t)kZ→Z ≤ eβ(t), t ≥ 0, and from this fact one readily obtains

that (V (t))t>0 is a C0-semigroup in B(Z). The above bound
follows by continuity and density from the estimate

1
β(t) kU(t)Ryk for y ∈ Y . This is obvious.

bq(bU(t)π(y)) = bq(π(U(t)y)) = q(U(t)y)
≤ eβ(t)q(y) ≤ eβ(t)bq(π(y)),

(c) kV (t)zkZ ≥ kzkZ for all z ∈ Z: For y ∈ Y and t ≥ 0,

y ∈ Y, t ≥ 0.

bq(bU (t)π(y)) = lim sup

t→∞

Then we apply continuity and density.

β(t + s)

≥ bq(π(y)).

(d) V (t) ◦ π = π ◦ U(t) (t ≥ 0) and then one easily obtains that
π(D(L)) ⊆ D(H) and H ◦ π = π ◦ L on D(L), where H is the
inﬁnitesimal generator of (V (t))t≥0.

(e) σ(H) ⊆ σ(L): By hypothesis, (U(t))t≥0 is of exponential type
δ > 0 whence, as is well known, for y ∈ Y and λ ∈ C, ℜλ > δ,

R(λ, L)y := −(λ − L)−1y = −Z ∞

0

e−λtU(t)y dt.

(V (t))t≥0 is of exponential type 0, and therefore we have for
z ∈ Z and λ ∈ C, ℜλ > 0,

Similarly, since kV (t)kZ→Z ≤ eβ(t) for all t ≥ 0, the semigroup
R(λ, H)z := −(λ − H)−1z = −Z ∞

e−λtV (t)z dt.

0

On the other hand, R commutes with U(t), t ≥ 0, by as-
sumption and so R commutes with R(λ, L) for ℜλ > δ. Then
q(R(λ, L)y) ≤ kR(λ, L)kq(y) for all y ∈ Y , which implies that
N is R(λ, L)-invariant. Hence one can deﬁne the bounded op-

y ∈ Y . Thus,

erator bR(λ, L) on Z given by bR(λ, L)(π(y)) := π (R(λ, L)y),
bR(λ, L)π(y) = π (R(λ, L)y) = −Z ∞

e−λtπ (U(t)y) dt

0

e−λtV (t)π(y)dt = R(λ, H)π(y)

= −Z ∞

0

where (d) has been applied in the last but one equality. Hence

bR(λ, L) = R(λ, H), for ℜλ > δ.

identity

Now, for ℜλ > δ and any µ ∈ ρ(L), by using the resolvent

R(λ, L) − R(µ, L) = (λ − µ)R(λ, L)R(µ, L)

6

J. E. GAL ´E, M. M. MART´INEZ AND P. J. MIANA

on Y and its corresponding identity for bR(λ, L) and bR(µ, L) on

Z, one readily ﬁnds that there exists R(µ, H) with

R(µ, H) = bR(µ, L),

see more details in [11, p. 234]. Thus µ ∈ ρ(H). Hence ρ(L) ⊆
ρ(H) as we claimed.

(f) σP (H ∗) ⊆ σP (L∗). This is straightforward to see, using restric-

tions of functionals; see [11, p. 234].

Suppose, if possible, that Z 6= {0}. By (e) above, we have that
σ(H)∩iR is countable and then iR\σ(H) 6= ∅. So, by (c) above and [11,
Lemma 2], the C0-semigroup (V (t))t≥0 can be extended to a C0-group

(eV (t))t∈R such that keV (−t)kZ→Z ≤ 1 (t > 0) and keV (t)kZ→Z = O(tk),

as t → +∞. Also, σ(H) is nonempty by (b) above and [11, Lemma 5].
Then reasoning as in [11, Theorem 7] one gets σP (H ∗) ∩ iR 6= ∅
whence σP (L∗) ∩ iR 6= ∅ by (f) above. This is a contradiction and so
we have proved that Z = {0}. By (a) above, we get the statement. (cid:3)

The following theorem is the quoted extension of [5, Theorem 5.6].

Theorem 2.2. Let ω be a nonquasianalytic weight such that eω is of

polynomial growth at inﬁnity. Let (X, k · k) be a Banach space and
(Tn(t))t≥0 be a n-times integrated semigroup in B(X) with generator
(A, D(A)) such that kTn(t)k ≤ ω(t), t ≥ 0. Let assume that σ(A) ∩ iR
is countable and σP (A∗) ∩ iR = ∅.

For every µ > 0 we have:

(i) If ω(t)−1 = o(t−(n−1)), as t → ∞, then

ω(t)−1Tn(t)An(µ − A)−2nx = 0,

x ∈ X.

lim
t→∞

(ii) If ω(t) ∼ tn−1, as t → ∞, then

lim
t→∞

tn−1 Tn(t)An(µ − A)−2nx = −

An−1(µ − A)−nx

(n − 1)!

x ∈ X.

Proof. Take µ > δ > 0. For x ∈ X deﬁne

kxkY := sup
t≥0

ke−δt(Tn(t)An(µ − A)−nx +

n−1Xj=0

tj

Aj(µ − A)−nx)k.

Note that A(µ − A)−1 = −I + µ(µ − A)−1 is a bounded operator on
X and Tn(0) = 0, so k · kY is a norm on X and there exists a constant
Mδ > 0 such that

(2)

k(µ − A)−nxk ≤ kxkY ≤ Mδkxk,

x ∈ X.

Let Y be the Banach space obtained as the completion of X in
the norm k · kY . By the Extrapolation Theorem [3, Theorem 0.2],
there exists a closed operator B on Y which generates a C0-semigroup
(S(t))t≥0 ⊂ B(Y ) of positive exponential type such that D(Bn) ֒→
X ֒→ Y , A = BX where the operator BX is given by the conditions

STABILITY OF N -TIMES INTEGRATED SEMIGROUPS

7

D(BX) := {x ∈ D(B) ∩ X : Bx ∈ X}, BX (x) := B(x) (x ∈ X).
Moreover, σP (B∗) ⊆ σP (A∗), and also ρ(A) = ρ(B) with

(3)

(λ − A)−1x = (λ − B)−1x,

λ ∈ ρ(A) = ρ(B), x ∈ X;

see [3, Remark 3.1].

Let (Sn(t))t≥0 be the n-times integrated semigroup generated by B

on Y , given by

Sn(t)y :=

1

(n − 1)!Z t

0

(t − s)n−1S(s)y ds,

y ∈ Y.

Then Sn(t)x = Tn(t)x for all x ∈ X and t ≥ 0. To see this, note that
(Tn(t))t≥0 and (Sn(t))t≥0 are of exponential type so one can rewrite (3)
above in terms of the Laplace transforms of (Tn(t))t≥0 and (Sn(t))t≥0
respectively, for ℜλ large enough. Then it suﬃces to apply the unique-
ness of the Laplace transform.

From the above identiﬁcation between Tn(t) and Sn(t), it readily

follows that

kSn(u)xkY ≤ kTn(u)k kxkY ≤ ω(u)kxkY ,

u ≥ 0, x ∈ X,

which is to say, by density, that kSn(u)k ≤ ω(u), for all u ≥ 0.

Now, by reiteration of the well known equality

S(t)y − y =Z t

0

BS(s)y ds

(t ≥ 0, y ∈ D(B)),

we have

S(t)y = Sn(t)Bny +

and therefore there exists a constant Cµ > 0 such that

t ≥ 0.

Then, by applying Theorem 1.2 with U(t) = S(t), B = L and R =

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. In the setting of Theorem 2.2, let assume in ad-
dition that 0 ∈ ρ(A). Since the resolvent function of A is holomorphic
-so continuous- in the open subset ρ(A) ⊆ C we have that

lim
µ→0+

An(µ − A)−n = lim
µ→0+

(−I + µ(µ − A)−1)n = (−1)nI.

Now, to prove (i) and (ii) of the theorem it suﬃces to notice that
supt>0 ω(t)−1kTn(t)k < ∞ in both cases.
(cid:3)

3. Final comments and remarks

It looks desirable to ﬁnd out the behavior of a n-times integrated
semigroup at inﬁnity when its generator A is not assumed to be invert-
ible. According to the remark prior to Theorem 1.1 the existence of
limt→∞ Tn(x) (for n = 1) entails invertibility of A. Thus the type of
convergence at inﬁnity of Tn(t), if there is some, that one can expect if
A is not invertible must be weaker than the existence of limit.

In [7], under the assumptions

sup
t>0

t−nkTn(t)k < ∞ and lim
t→0+

n!t−nTn(t)x = x (x ∈ X),

it has been proved that

lim
t→∞

t−nTn(t)πn(f ) = 0,

f ∈ Sn,

iσ(A) ∩ R, and πn(f ) = (−1)nR ∞
Schwarz class in the norm f 7→ R ∞

in the operator norm, where Sn is the subspace of functions of T (n)
+ (tn)
which are of spectral synthesis in T (n)(|t|n) with respect to the subset
0 f (n)(t)Tn(t) dt. Here, T (n)(|t|n)
is the convolution Banach algebra obtained as the completion of the
+ (tn) is
the restriction of T (n)(|t|n) on (0, ∞). This result is an extension of
the Esterle-Strouse-V˜u-Zouakia theorem, which corresponds to the case
n = 0; see [6] and [10]. In [6] it is shown that, under the assumptions
that σ(A)∩iR is countable and σP (A∗)∩iR = ∅, the subspace π0(S0)X

−∞ |f (n)(t)| |t|n dt, and T (n)

is dense in X so one gets another way –for it is diﬀerent from the original
one– to establish the Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-V˜u theorem. The proof of
that density is attained by methods of harmonic analysis.

We wonder if in the case when A is not invertible the argument con-
sidered in [6] to deduce the Arendt-Batty-Lyubich-V˜u theorem works
for n-times integrated semigroups; that is, if πn(Sn)X is dense in X
(under the conditions σ(A) ∩ iR countable and σP (A∗) ∩ iR = ∅). This
would give us the ergodic type property
t−nTn(t)x = 0,

x ∈ X.

(5)

lim
t→∞

Notice that (5) is a consequence of Theorem 1.2 (i) when A is invertible;
on the other hand, the ergodicity of a n-times integrated semigroup
(Tn(t))t≥0 such that supt≥1 t−nkTn(t)k < ∞ is characterized in [5] in
terms of Abel-ergodicity or/and ergodic decompositions of the Banach
space X. Such an approach will be considered in a forthcoming paper.
