Abstract

We explore a new class of natural models which ensure the one-
loop divergences in the Higgs mass are cancelled. The top-partners
that cancel the top loop are new gauge bosons, and the symme-
try relation that ensures the cancellation arises at an infrared
ﬁxed point. Such a cancellation mechanism can, a la Little Higgs
models, push the scale of new physics that completely solves the
hierarchy problem up to 5-10 TeV. When embedded in a super-
symmetric model, the stop and gaugino masses provide the cutoﬀs
for the loops, and the mechanism ensures a cancellation between
the stop and gaugino mass dependence of the Higgs mass param-
eter.

Introduction

The discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs boson by the CMS and ATLAS experiments
ﬁlls in the ﬁnal particle in the Standard Model (SM). In order to achieve the
measured Higgs mass, however, the SM requires a ﬁne-tuning of the mass
parameter to cancel against divergent loop contributions. Meanwhile, LEP
constraints suggest that higher dimension operators are suppressed by a scale
around 10 TeV [1]. This “little” hierarchy problem provides a compelling
motivation to study physics beyond the SM which can cancel the divergent
loop contributions and make the theory technically natural. SUSY is the
prime example of a natural theory, with stop squark loops canceling the
divergent part of the top loops, and gauginos doing the same for the gauge
loops. However, with the absence (so far) of any kind of colored top-partners
at the LHC there has been a great rush to abandon naturalness as a guiding
principle in searching for extensions of the the SM. This has lead to an
advance (retreat?) into anthropic landscapes, which seem to be highly non-
predictive for particle physics.

Before we abandon naturalness, it would be good to have some idea of
how many classes of natural theories exist that have not yet been excluded
by LHC data. For example, Little Higgs theories provide an alternative class
of natural theories where a global symmetry provides a top-partner which is
a fermion (rather than a scalar as happens in SUSY). There has also been
recent progress ﬁnding new types of natural models in the class of “neutral
naturalness” models [2], where a discrete symmetry provides a fermionic top-
partner that is color neutral.

Here we examine yet another type of natural theory where the top-partner
is a gauge boson1. In order to cancel the quadratic divergence in the top loop,
the top partner gauge boson needs to have a coupling that is related to the
top Yukawa coupling. In our scenario this relation between the couplings is
accidental in that it is not the result of a symmetry of the Lagrangian, but
arises only at an infrared ﬁxed point. As in [4], we expect that this extra
bit of conformal symmetry can only cancel divergent diagrams at one-loop,
since conformal symmetry does not by itself ensure that scalar masses vanish.
With a one-loop cancellation we can proceed as in Little Higgs models, and
push the scale of new physics that completely solves the hierarchy problem

1A model with a gauge boson top partner has already appeared [3], but in that case

the gauge boson was a superpartner of the top quark.

up to 5-10 TeV. For example, superpartners could have 10 TeV masses, so
SUSY would ensure that the Higgs mass is kept below 10 TeV, and our new
mechanism, which we will refer to as Little Conformal Symmetry, can ensure
the cancellations that keep the Higgs below 1 TeV.

Of course, there have been many attempts to use conformal symmetry to
address the hierarchy problem [5], but these attempts typically stumble on
imperfect cancellations [4, 6], or ultimately on the existence of the Planck
scale. The underlying problem, as we have said, is that while the vanishing of
scalar masses is necessary for the existence of conformal symmetry, conformal
symmetry does not, by itself, enforce a vanishing scalar mass. However if we
only need the cancellation to work at one-loop, then there is still hope that
conformal symmetry can be useful. There is also a further problem that
conformal symmetry cannot help with: what determines the cutoﬀs in the
divergent loops? This can only be answered in a theory where the cutoﬀs are
calculable, so we will examine the case where Little Conformal Symmetry
embeded in a supersymmetric model with gauge mediation where the ratio
of stop and gaugino masses is ﬁxed by gauge couplings.

This paper is organized as follows:

in the next section we describe a
simple toy model the illustrates the mechanism, then we turn to a more
realistic model which does not assume that the diﬀerent loop cutoﬀs are
equal. Finally we present our conclusions and make suggestions for searching
for a completely realistic model.

2 A Toy Model

The contributions to the quadratic divergence of the Higgs mass come from
the following diagrams shown in Fig. 1. Including only the leading fermionic

where λ is the Higgs quartic coupling, yt is the top Yukawa, the i index runs
over all the gauge couplings of the Higgs, and C i
2(H) is the quadratic Casimir
of the Higgs ﬁeld representation in the ith gauge group [8].

Long ago, Veltman [9] suggested that there could be a cancellation of
these disparate contributions. However, no symmetry was found that would
ensure the cancelation, and the required top mass was the (then) almost
unimaginably large value of 69 GeV. A further problem with Veltman’s pro-
posal is that if some new physics cuts oﬀ the integrals, then there is no
guarantee that the cutoﬀs of the three diﬀerent types of loops would be the
same. In the context of SUSY, the top loop is cut oﬀ by the stop squark
mass, while the gauge loops are cut oﬀ by the gaugino masses, which are
typically not equal in models of dynamical SUSY breaking.

Let us ﬁrst consider how the top loop could be cancelled by a new non-
Abelian gauge boson loop. For this to occur the Higgs would have to be
embedded in a multiplet of a new gauge group. For the Yukawa coupling
to be gauge invariant, one or both of the left-handed and right-handed tops
would also have to transform under the new gauge symmetry. Let us also
assume for now that the cutoﬀs of the two loop integrations are the same.
(We will return to this point in the next section, where the cutoﬀs will be
superpartner masses that will not be equal.) Ensuring the cancellation gives
us a requirement that the top Yukawa coupling, yt, is related to the new
gauge coupling gN . Surely no symmetry of a Lagrangian could force such a
relation, but if the top Yukawa coupling is at an infrared ﬁxed point that
was determined by the value of the new gauge coupling, which itself is at an
infrared ﬁxed point, then there is a relation between the two couplings.

In order to construct a simple toy model that illustrates this mechanism,
we will for now ignore the eﬀects of the SM gauge groups and the quartic
Higgs coupling. For concreteness let us embed the Higgs and the right-handed
top in a fundamental and anti-fundamental of a SU (N ) gauge group. The
β-function for the top Yukawa coupling in this theory is [10, 11]:

where C2(F ) is the quadratic Casimir of the representation of fermion F
under SU (N ), and nD is the number of Higgs doublets, so in the SM Nc = 3
and nD = 1 and the ﬁrst coeﬃcient reduces to the standard result 9/32π2.
In our toy model C2(tL) = 0 and nD = N , so a Yukawa ﬁxed point occurs
when [12]

(2.5)

and since the tR and the Higgs are in conjugate SU (N ) representations the
solution is N = 4.

For the toy model to be consistent we also need the SU (4) gauge coupling

to be at a ﬁxed point. The two-loop gauge β-function is

When the gauge group is asymptotically free, i.e. b > 0, then often c < 0,
and if b is small there is a perturbative Banks-Zaks ﬁxed point [13] for yt = 0.
There is no general theorem determining whether there are ﬁxed points for
yt (cid:54)= 0, but they can be easily found by scanning over the possible gauge
representations of the matter ﬁelds. Generically there are multiple solutions
for ﬁxed points of the coupling gN at the ﬁxed point yt∗, depending on the
matter content of the gauge theory, we will call them gN∗i. In order to make
an interesting model we would arrange SU (4) to break at some scale around
Λ ∼ 5-10 TeV; that is, parts of the extended tR and Higgs multiplets can get
masses at this scale, while the components corresponding to the SM tR and
Higgs remain light. The gauge bosons could have masses somewhere between
1 TeV and Λ. Given the measured value of yt we could run it up towards the
UV, and at each RG scale µi where yt(µi) satisﬁes Eq. (2.3) with gN∗ = gN∗i
we have a possible consistent model.

3 A More Realistic Toy Model

If we try to directly apply the mechanism of the previous section to the SM,
we immediately run into a problem: the QCD contribution to top Yukawa
β function (2.2) is much larger that the Yukawa contribution. This implies
that the new gauge group would not dominate at a ﬁxed point and this
would spoil our cancellation. In order to get around this we can embed color
SU (3)c in SU (N ), and take both tL and tR to transform under conjugate
representations of SU (N ). Going further we can take a semi-simple gauge
group SU (N ) × SU (N(cid:48)) with the understanding that SU (3)c is the diagonal
subgroup of SU (3)L×SU (3)R ⊂ SU (N )×SU (N(cid:48)). We will also assume that
the top quarks are charged under an additional global SU (M ) symmetry to
enhance the otherwise small top loop contribution to both (2.2) and (2.4).
In order to connect to the pheonomenology of the SM and ensure anomaly
cancellation for the SU (N ) and SU (N(cid:48)) gauge ﬁelds, we must introduce
the spectator fermions bR that contain the right-handed bottom quark. For
now we will only consider Yukawa couplings that give masses to the top
quark. A summary of the charge assignments for the third generation quarks
and Higgs ﬁelds consistent with anomaly cancellation are given in Table 1
(a second choice that yields asymptotic freedom and anomaly cancellation
interchanges the bN and bM representations).

The one-loop running of a Yukawa coupling can be computed from the

the results of Machacek and Vaughn [10] we can easily ﬁnd the one-loop beta

Here we also account for the fact that the cutoﬀs for the integrals in the
quadratic divergence are in general diﬀerent, and denote them as Λt, ΛN ,
and ΛN(cid:48). In the context of SUSY, Λt is proportional to the stop mass, while
the gauge cutoﬀs are set by gaungino masses. To ﬁnd a relation between the
cutoﬀs, we would need the details of the SUSY-breaking mechanism.

A simple model for producing squark and gaugino masses is gauge me-
diation [14]. These models assume that there is Goldstino multiplet X with
a Yukawa coupling to messenger charged under the SM gauge groups and
aVEV

(cid:104)X(cid:105) = MU V + θ2F .
This yields gaugino masses at one-loop given by

for a UV scale Λ, and an equivalent expression for ΛN(cid:48). The logarithmic
factors are equal to leading order in the gauge coupling, and may be cancelled
in (3.2), since the diﬀerence corresponds to a higher loop eﬀect. We will also
assume that the gauge coupling is at its ﬁxed point up to the scale Λ; this
may not be the case in a fully realistic model, but again deviations from this
limit correspond to higher order loop eﬀects [4].

In order to prevent a Higgs soft-mass at the 10 TeV scale, like the stop
squarks, a combination of chiral and vector-like messengers [18] may be
needed in the high energy theory; due to the opposite signs of their con-
tributions to the gaugino masses, a judicious choice of representations could
allow for a light Higgs mass. We are of course primarily concerned with
contributions to the Higgs mass from physics below the 10 TeV scale.

The coeﬃcients in (3.7) and (3.8) are sensitive to the matter content of the
UV theory, and ensuring consistency between the three ﬁxed point conditions
and the cancellation of the quadratic divergence requires speciﬁc choices of
representations and multiplicities of UV ﬁeld content.

There is tension between needing αN,N(cid:48) > α3 to satisfy (3.9) and having the

so we may choose parameters such that (3.9) or (3.10) is satisﬁed, but not
both. Table 2 of the appendix summarizes theories with gauge couplings
larger than α3 at ΛIR = 1 TeV, while Table 3 summarizes those that match
the SM value of αt at 1 TeV to within 5%. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the
top-loop cutoﬀ to the SU (N ) gauge-loop cutoﬀ for these theories. We made
the simplifying assumtion that ΛN /αN = ΛN(cid:48)/αN(cid:48) (or a rational multiple
thereof) as in gauge mediation. In the class of models studied we generically
require a rather large global SU (M ) symmetry for the top quarks, or a large
running of αN or αN(cid:48) from the TeV scale to the 10 TeV scale.

While t¯t resonance experiments will be sensitive to additional gauge
symmetries, even greater experimental constraints come from precision elec-

vector-like masses that do not require a Higgs VEV. Any solution to the
Higgs mass problem should also include a mechanism for sending α2 to a
ﬁxed point as well, a feature we have ignored.
In this respect, a realistic
model will probably look quite diﬀerent from our toy model.

4 Conclusions

We have seen that new gauge interactions that couple only to top quarks and
the Higgs ﬁeld allow for a cancellation of the top-loop quadratic divergence
in the Higgs mass at one-loop. To enforce this condition, the SM must be
embedded in a UV theory (above a 5-10 TeV threshold) with ﬁxed points
for the gauge couplings and the top Yukawa coupling. In a supersymmet-
ric context, with calculable stop and gaugino masses, this can lead to the
cancellation of the stop and gaugino mass dependence in the Higgs mass.

Since the cancellation depends on the top and gauge loop cutoﬀs, in
order to search for a fully realistic model one also has know the form of the
cutoﬀ. For supersymmetric theories this means that one needs to include a
mechanism to mediate supersymmetry breaking to the supersymmetric SM
sector. In this sense the mechanism is highly constrained, which also means
that it is highly predictive.
We have not addressed how to account for the divergences from the
SU (2)L × U (1)Y gauge and Higgs quartic couplings. It is possible that this
could be addressed by additional ﬁxed point conditions, or another mecha-
nism altogether; for example the theory could possess light (TeV scale) winos,
binos, and higgsinos. In order to preserve the ﬁxed point structure however,
the U (1)Y would have to be embedded in a non-Abelian group.

In general, the cancellation of one-loop quadratic divergences in the Higgs
mass does not require the existence of IR ﬁxed points, we can also envisage
that the ratios of couplings αN /αt approaches a ﬁxed value2. This is much less
restrictive than enforcing IR ﬁxed points for both couplings simultaneously,
and provides hope that more realistic models can be constructed.

A UV Matter Content

UV matter content and gauge parameters for theories with αN,N(cid:48) > α3 at
ΛIR = 1 TeV are given in Table 2. Here a gauge group of SU (N ) × SU (N(cid:48))
is assumed, with a global symmetry group for top quarks of SU (M ). Weyl
fermion numbers nij of UV matter content are scanned over with i, j =
1, F, A corresponding to singlets, fundamentals, or adjoints under SU (N )
and SU (N(cid:48)). We assume SUSY in the UV theory to set the number of real
scalars as sij = 4nij. Theories are listed in order of ascending relative error
in Eq. (3.10).

Tables 3 and 4 list theories that match the running of αt to (3.10). Table
3 lists the top ﬁve minimal matter content scenarios that satisfy Eq. (3.10).
Table 4 lists the theories that match most closely with the gauge-mediated
SUSY breaking scenario described in Section 3.

All candidate theories have nA1, n1A, nF F , nAF , nF A, nAA = 0 due to

their large impact on the β-functions of the couplings.
