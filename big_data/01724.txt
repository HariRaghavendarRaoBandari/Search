Abstract: I show how elliptic genera for various Calabi-Yau threefolds may be understood
from supergravity localization using the quantization of the phase space of certain multi-
center conﬁgurations.
I present a simple procedure that allows for the enumeration of all
multi-center conﬁgurations contributing to the polar sector of the elliptic genera—explicitly
verifying this in the cases of the quintic in P4, the sextic in WP(2,1,1,1,1), the octic in WP(4,1,1,1,1)
and the dectic in WP(5,2,1,1,1). With an input of the corresponding ‘single-center’ indices
(Donaldson-Thomas invariants), the polar terms have been known to determine the elliptic
genera completely. I argue that this multi-center approach to the low-lying spectrum of the
elliptic genera is a stepping stone towards an understanding of the exact microscopic states
that contribute to supersymmetric single center black hole entropy in N = 2 supergravity.

1 Introduction

Since the seminal work of [1, 2], the study of black hole microscopics has received signiﬁcant
attention. A quantum understanding of black holes had been plagued with several problems
for decades. Of them, the apparent inﬁniteness of the Hilbert space of states associated to
the horizons was particularly striking [3]. The microscopic explanation of black hole entropy
elegantly solved this problem in a naturally UV complete setting; that of string theory.

At this juncture, one had two obvious paths to deliberate between. One, to take the
ﬁniteness of the space of states as a ﬁnal result from string theory and seek an understanding
of the special nature of interaction between these degrees of freedom that endow black holes
with their exceedingly mysterious dynamics; this is perhaps an obvious path leading towards
a quantum understanding of gravitational dynamics. The other, perhaps more modest path,
would have been to ﬁrst seek a reﬁned understanding of the static; more than a mere count
of states, that is. Both paths have been travelled, even extensively if one might add, and
yet it is fair to say that much is left to be understood. The microscopic counting of [1, 2]
accounts for the number of states, to leading order in charges, that yield black hole entropy.
What is counted on the microscopic front is an index—a sum over all ‘angular momentum
states’. The macroscopic black hole is a singlet in that it is a static, stationary spherically
symmetric solution to the bulk supergravity equations of motion. While the leading order
counting of states matches with the macroscopic entropy, an often under-appreciated problem
is the lack of understanding of what each of these states is. One reason for the diﬃculty in
identifying them exactly is that a sum over states of a given representation under the angular

– 1 –

momentum group is not a protected quantity. On the macroscopic front, however, a sum over
various black hole conﬁgurations may seem unnatural. In examples with suﬃcient amount of
supersymmetry, signiﬁcant progress has been made [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Nevertheless, in
cases with lesser supersymmetry, the picture is a lot less clear. In this article, I study one
such set-up that is least understood in this context—the one of [2]. The macroscopic black
holes of interest here are supersymmetric dyonic ones in N = 2, d = 4 supergravity obtained
from a Calabi-Yau1 compactiﬁcation of M-Theory (an obvious, equivalent picture exists in
the Type IIA setting). The microscopic states that count their entropy arise in what has been
dubbed the MSW CFT, after the authors of [2].

The MSW CFT is a (0,4) supersymmetric non-linear sigma model that is believed to ﬂow
to a conformal ﬁxed point in the IR. The supersymmetric states of this theory can be counted
via an index—the modiﬁed elliptic genus [12, 13]

where q = e2πiτ with τ being the modulus of the torus on which the theory is to live and ¯q is
its complex conjugate. F refers to the fermion number as in the case of the standard Witten
index. cL and cR label the left and right moving central charges of the ﬁeld theory. Finally,
y = e2πiz is a fugacity associated to the elliptic variable z and is raised with a ‘chemical
potential’ J3 associated to the eigenvalue of the third generator2 of the SU (2) Kac-Moody
algebra. BPS excitations of this theory, counted by the above partition function, have been
shown to grow exactly as does the entropy of a macroscopic single center supersymmetric
black hole in the four dimensional N = 2 supergravity theory [2]. Exciting as that result may
already be, the above modiﬁed elliptic genus (1.1) in fact enjoys an even richer structure. It
is a weak Jacobi form of weight (− 3
2 ) and is endowed with a Θ-decomposition3 in terms of
vector valued modular forms Zγ as [12, 13]

Z (q, ¯q, y) =

Zγ (q) Θγ (q, ¯q, y) ,

(1.2)

γ=0

where γ labels the independent elements of the corresponding discriminant group. Loosely
speaking, the vector valued modular form Zγ captures the growth of states of the par-
tition function (1.1) while the Θγ functions—forming modular representations of weight
2 h(1,1)(CY3) − 1, 1
( 1
2 )—add to the rich pole structure of the modiﬁed elliptic genus. While
much more can be said of this decomposition than is within the scope of this article or my
current understanding, I will restrict my attention to the vector Zγ which captures the growth
1In this article, by a Calabi-Yau manifold, I refer to one with maximal holonomy. More is known about

this setup when one relaxes this condition [5].

2J3 refers to the angular momentum of the macroscopic black hole dual to a given state in the ﬁeld theory.

Calabi-Yau being compactiﬁed on. For details, see [12, 13].

2 ), Zγ would carry modular weight − 3

of states that endow the macroscopic black holes with their entropy. For simplicity, I will
also consider those compactiﬁcations with h(1,1) = 1; this allows for a study of uni-modulus
supergravity theory on the macroscopic front. Furthermore, given that the Θγ functions are
2 . Finally, Zγ is also endowed with
then of weight (0, 1
a q-expansion—the coeﬃcients of which capture a sum over all the black hole microstate
degeneracies falling in various representations of the space-time angular momentum—that
begins with a negative power of q. The polar sector of the modular form is deﬁned to be the
set of all terms in this expansion with negative powers of q; knowledge of all the polar terms
uniquely determines the entire modiﬁed elliptic genus [12, 13, 14].

The leading order growth of coeﬃcients in this q-expansion of Zγ is what a Cardy-
estimate of the growth of states counts. However, as the trace in the deﬁnition of the index
indicates, all bound states with a total charge equalling that of a single center black hole
also contribute to the corresponding term in the q-expansion. While contributions from any
one of these bound states may be small, the number of possible conﬁgurations clearly grows
as the number of partitions of the charge/energy level in question. As Ramanujan famously
showed, this number grows exponentially; much like the Cardy estimate, one might observe.
This raises the following question–

What states is the Cardy formula really counting?

It is the aim of this article to provide a disambiguation of this issue and work towards
an answer to the above question. Ideally, a clinching answer would be a listing of all bound
states contributing to a large charge coeﬃcient in the q-expansion of Zγ leaving an appro-
priate single-center entropy and the origin of the corresponding states behind. However, the
exponentially large number of such bound states renders this practically impossible to achieve.
One hopes to uncover a structure in the contributions arising from these bound states that
may be extrapolated to arbitrary charges. Since the polar terms are the low-lying states and
are those that actually entirely determine the modular form uniquely, one may imagine that
they provide for a good starting point.

One may in fact opt for a more direct approach to understand single-center black hole
entropy:
it has been shown [15] that sub-leading corrections to the growth of states of the
modiﬁed elliptic genus depend on their representation of angular momentum. It is certainly
an interesting way forward and deserves more attention than it has received, in my opinion.
Notwithstanding this aside, I take the former approach in this article.

In this article, I present a systematic way to identify all the multi-center conﬁgurations
that enumerate the polar states of the vector valued modular form Zγ using the equivariant re-
ﬁned index introduced in [16, 17]; as has been noted before [18] no single-center conﬁgurations
contribute to the polar sector. Along the way I ﬁnd some interesting results regarding the
existence—or lack thereof—of certain three-center conﬁgurations involving D2( ¯D2) charges.

– 3 –

I work by example to identify all the multi-centers needed to uniquely determine the elliptic
genera of the following Calabi-Yau threefolds: the quintic in P4, the sextic in WP(2,1,1,1,1), the
octic in WP(4,1,1,1,1) and the dectic in WP(5,2,1,1,1). All results in this article that have been
derived before in [13, 14], agree with those references; furthermore, as in the said references,
I use the known Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. These were computed in [19, 20, 21] while the
relation of Gromov-Witten invariants to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants is excellently reviewed
in [22]4. Finally, the equivalence of these to Donaldson-Thomas invariants was conjectured
and proved in [23, 24, 25, 26].

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, I review the relevant multi-
center conﬁgurations of interest and provide an intuitive argument for what the appropriate
index that counts their interaction degrees of freedom must be; furthermore, I also spell out
the prescription to be used to identify those conﬁgurations that contribute to the polar terms
of the elliptic genera under consideration. In Section 3, I explicitly compute the said indices
for several examples. I conclude with a discussion in Section 4

2 The reﬁned equivariant index

In this section, I will ﬁrst review the phase space of multi-center conﬁgurations, merely stating
results and known facts. Details may be found in [18, 27, 28]. I then move on to a present
an intuitive explanation for the appropriate index that counts multi-center degeneracies.

Multi-center conﬁgurations in N = 2 supergravity are characterized by a metric ansatz

for stationary solutions

ds2 = − e2U ((cid:126)r) (dt + a((cid:126)r))2 + e−2U ((cid:126)r)d(cid:126)r2 ,

(2.1)

with a((cid:126)r) denoting a Kaluza-Klein one-form and U ((cid:126)r) the scale factor. The scalars in the
vector multiplet are typically called ta, with the index a running over the set of all vector
multiplets. Since I restrict to Type IIA compactiﬁcations with h(1,1) = 1, there is only
one modulus in the theory allowing for a dropping of the index a. The real and imaginary
decomposition of the modulus is labelled as t = B + iJ. Denoting the charge lattice by Γ, a
given center carries charges that form a vector α ∈ Γ; for the case at hand in uni-modulus

supergravity, this vector is four-dimensional: (cid:0)p0, p, q, q0

(cid:1). The charges p0 and p are magnetic

in my conventions and correspond to D6 and D4 brane charges in Type IIA language. Whilst
q and q0 are electric charges corresponding to D2 and D0 excitations. There is a natural
symplectic inner product between two such charge vectors α and ˜α

and it is clearly antisymmetric. For a multi-center conﬁguration with total charge γ =(cid:80)

i αi,
with each center at a location (cid:126)ri, the scale factor and the value of the modulus t are uniquely

The moduli space of the scalars in the vector multiplet is a special K¨ahler manifold that
has a principal bundle over its base space with a structure group Sp(2nv + 2), where nv is
the number of vector multiplets in the theory. Calling the coordinates on the ﬁbers of the
appropriate vector bundle X A and FA, the manifold aﬀords a nowhere vanishing holomorphic
symplectic section. The index A runs over nv + 1 indices; therefore A ∈ {0, 1}. Now,

in the above attractor equations, Ω(t((cid:126)r)) = −eK/2(cid:0)X A, FA

In the one-modulus supergravity theory at hand, projective symmetry allows for a ﬁxing of
the X 0 coordinate to unity leaving the only modulus t = X 1/X 0. The coordinates FA on the
ﬁbers are in fact derived, as FA = ∂AF , from the prepotential F of the theory:

the case of small charge conﬁgurations, they turn out to have a rather speciﬁc and easily controlled eﬀect insofar
as regularity of solutions is concerned. I will be explicit about this eﬀect in further sections.

Having speciﬁed all the quantities appearing in the attractor equations (2.3), there is one
additional and extremely important constraint that these multi-center conﬁgurations must
satisfy; that of regularity. One might impose this by demanding the positivity of the scale
factor in front of the d(cid:126)r2 term in the metric. The attractor equations can be shown to imply
that—for a conﬁguration with i centers located at (cid:126)ri—this is equivalent to evaluating the
entropy on the regularity vector appearing on the right hand side of the attractor equations

(2.11)

One may in fact solve for the attractor equations in full generality in uni-modulus supergrav-
ity to spell out this entropy function explicitly [29]. I present the explicit formula in the next
section.

At this stage, however, the goal is to understand how one may calculate the total number
of degrees of freedom associated to such a gravitational solution. To this end, an ‘equivariant
reﬁned index’ for such bound states as described was proposed in [16, 17]. While I leave the
technical derivation of this reﬁned index to those papers, in what follows I argue for the cor-
rectness of their proposed index. It is my hope that this discussion gives an intuitive picture
leaving the more rigorous, technical treatment to those original papers.

Consider the solutions of the integrability equations (2.8). Although the equations are
seemingly simple, they are deceptively so. There is no general analytic solution set to these
equations. However, for a given conﬁguration, one might numerically solve for the positions
ri of the black hole centers. In general, there is a non-trivial angular momentum associated to
every point in the space generated by the solutions of the Denef equations; for a single-center
on the other hand, spherical symmetry ensures that this angular momentum is zero. There is

– 6 –

also an action of the rotation group SO(3) that leaves the space of solutions invariant; this is
just a rotation of the whole conﬁguration of the bound state in space-time. The correspond-
ing study of such spaces, with an action of a group, in the Mathematics literature is that of
Hamiltonian spaces and equivariant cohomology. Leaving the intricate details to the excellent
review [30], I will resort to a more sketchy and qualitative consideration to tell the number
of degrees of freedom to be associated to such bound states. While a two center solution
can immediately be imagined, increasing the number of centers in the problem prevents easy
visualization. For instance, the integrability equations for a two center problem essentially ﬁx
the distance between the two centers7. Rotating this conﬁguration in space-time generates
a round sphere as the space of solutions; the sphere is clearly smooth and symplectic. To
generalize this to phase spaces of solutions of a conﬁguration with higher number of centers
is an open problem in Mathematics. Nevertheless, one can write down a symplectic two-form
on the phase space of solutions of the integrability equations [31]. It is again a non-trivial
task to prove that a given two-form is indeed non-degenerate on the phase space. Therefore,
that the phase space is symplectic is best left to be conjectural at this juncture. This phase
space is classical. An ‘equivariant volume element’ of this phase space (read as a volume
element that accounts for the non-trivial angular momentum at each point in the space) is
one that accounts for the interaction between the black hole centers. The phase space is
built out of these equivariant volume elements. This is an extremely important insight. It
tells us, among other things, that quantizing this phase space yields a quantum index of the
interaction between the black hole centers [17]. Such a quantum index is to keep track of
the interaction degrees of freedom of the black holes. While this is a very naive picture, a
more rigorous discussion can be found in [17]. In the following, I will take a slightly diﬀerent
perspective from [17] to understand this index.

In mathematical terms, quantization of a phase space that is symplectic, is best under-
stood with the theory of Geometric Quantization. An excellent review for aspects relevant
to us can be found in [32]. The basic idea is the following - given a line bundle (called the
pre-quantum line bundle) and a space of sections of this line bundle (called the pre-quantum
space) on the phase space, one can construct a quantum space as a set of subspace of sections
of this pre-quantum line bundle that vanishes under the action of a covariant derivative that
is deﬁned on the line bundle (via the corresponding connection). Physically speaking, a pre-
quantum space can be identiﬁed with the space of square integrable sections on an appropriate
pre-quantum line bundle. These sections would, upon quantization, build up the quantum
space - the Hilbert space of states. In the setting at hand, apart from square integrable sec-
tions on the line bundle, we also have a spinor bundle consisting of sections corresponding to
the fermionic supersymmetry generators in the theory. A clever ploy would be to choose the
covariant derivative to be the Dirac operator on the phase space. This is a clever choice for
the formally deﬁned equivariant index of the Dirac operator now counts the quantum states

7Up to translations that can be gauged by ﬁxing one of the centers to be at the origin.

in the theory. This is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of the index of the Dirac opera-
tor. It is worth understanding this index better for this is what is to be computed, eventually.

Given a vector bundle E → M on a manifold M with an action of a group G acting on
it; consider the action of the group on M such that it lifts to an action on E. The Dirac
operator (whose action is assumed to commute with G henceforth) is now deﬁned on the
space of sections of this vector bundle as

D : Γ(E) −→ Γ(E).

(2.12)

By deﬁnition, the equivariant index of this Dirac operator, for an element g ∈ G, is

IndG(g, D) = TrKerD+(g) − TrKerD−(g).

(2.13)
Equivalently, considering the Lie Algebra g of G and an element x = ln(g) ∈ g, the equivariant
index can be deﬁned as [33]

IndG(exp(x), D) =

Chg(x, E) ˆAg(x, M ),

where Ch denotes the Chern character and ˆA denotes the usual A-roof genus; this is also
called Kirilov’s formula. For the purposes of this article, in the spirit of the Witten index,
picking an element y2J3 ∈ G, where y is a formal generating parameter and J3 is the third
generator of the angular momentum algebra of the rotations in space-time, the index can now
be written as8

(cid:2)(−y)2J3(cid:3) − TrKerD−(cid:2)(−y)2J3(cid:3) .

gref({αi}, y) = TrKerD+

(2.15)

This is the index for a conﬁguration of black hole centers carrying charges αi that form a
bound state satisfying the integrability equations (2.8). gref stands for the reﬁned index; to
avoid confusion, I merely stick to conventional notation used in [17]. This can further be
shown to reduce to [17]

gref({αi}, y) =

Ch(ν,L) ˆA(ν,Mn),

(2.16)

where L is the line bundle, Mn is the phase space of an n-centered problem solving the
integrability equations and ν = ln y.

The idea now, is to compute this index via Localization. Knowing the group action on
the phase space, a localization technique under an Abelian subgroup of this group (U (1) of
SO(3)) results in a localization of the black hole centers along a line, say the z axis, with
manifest U (1) symmetry; the symmetry being rotations about the axis of localization. This

space; locally, however, the index is constant.

renders a non-vanishing contribution to the index only from the ﬁxed points that are the
black hole centers. What was originally a problem in R3 has now localized to a problem on
a line with the centers lying at positions, say zi. With this knowledge, one may write down
a ‘superpotential’ whose ﬁxed points are given by exactly the ﬁxed points of localization [17]

This superpotential is a function of n + 1 variables: the n centers and a parameter λ. With

with respect to z1, . . . , zn. Upon specifying y = −1, this gref is exactly that quantum index
which computes the interaction degrees of freedom arising from a given multi center black
hole solution to supergravity. Another interpretation of this quantity is that of the Poincar´e
polynomial associated to the moduli space of the quiver representations: each center in the
conﬁguration arises from a D-brane that may be treated as a node with an Abelian gauge
group associated to it. With bifundamentals extending between the bound centers playing
the arrows, these conﬁgurations do indeed take the guise of a quiver diagram[34]. Topological
invariants associated to the moduli space of representations of these quivers have been shown
to be enumerated by this index gref [35, 36]. With the knowledge of the interaction degrees
of freedom between the black hole centers, the total degeneracy associated to a multi-center
black hole conﬁguration can now be naturally written as

¯Ω({αi}; t) =

where ¯Ω({αi}; t) is the total degeneracy associated to the multi-center conﬁguration in ques-
tion, ¯ΩS(αi) corresponds to the rational index associated to a single black hole center carrying
charge αi and the |Aut({αi})| factor9 takes repeated centers into account. The single cen-
ter indices are input parameters. These rational indices are given, in terms of the integer
invariants, by

where ΩS(αi) are the integer invariants of the single centers.
It may be noted that the
product of these rational indices is the mathematical counterpart of the symmetric product
of the moduli spaces in the string regime, that contains several singularities [13, 14]. From a

supergravity perspective, however, this product can physically be understood as arising from
the Bose-Fermi statistics of the interacting single center black holes [16]. This essentially
negates all troubles encountered with singularities in the geometric counting.

dom, in this section I will show how one may identify those mutli-centers that contribute
to the polar terms of the MSW elliptic genus. Working by example, I explicitly show that
all polar terms of the quintic in P4, the sextic in WP(2,1,1,1,1), the octic in WP(4,1,1,1,1) and
the dectic in WP(5,2,1,1,1) can be reconstructed with this approach. In the next section, will
ﬁnish with an argument why this approach is well suited to identifying single-center black
hole entropy in the non-polar sector.

To this end, one ﬁrst needs to identify what the charges of individual terms of the q-
expansion of Zγ must be. Knowing that these charges arise from a D4 − D2 − D0 brane
construction, the central charge Zγ(t) provides an easy tool for this purpose. Dp branes
often support lower dimensional brane charges. A pure D4 brane, for instance, supports
non-zero D2 and D0 ﬂuxes [12, 13] to cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly [37]. Since these
branes must form localized objects as black holes in the four dimensional non-compact space
in the low energy theory, their extension is entirely conﬁned to the compact Calabi-Yau space.
Every Calabi-Yau threefold has a non-vanishing structure-sheaf. Since the D6 brane must
extend entirely in the threefold, one may view it as the structure-sheaf of the manifold and
consequently, there is always one at our disposal. The central charge of a BPS brane is given
by the same formula (2.9) as in the supergravity theory. However, the lower dimensional
ﬂuxes on the D6 brane induce additional curvature. In addition, if the brane has a non-trivial
gauge bundle turned on, the charge vector of the brane would arise from turning on the
relevant Chern classes. Taking all of these into consideration, the central charge takes the
form [18]

where the Ui represent integer classes in which the Chern classes of the gauge bundle have

solving the attractor equations for a large black hole with the above charges results in a
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = π |Zγ(tattractor)|2—where tattractor is the attractor value of
the modulus determined in terms of the charges—as follows [29]

given by (2.11), where the argument of the discriminant is chosen to be the ‘regularity vector’
appearing in the attractor equations

.

(3.6)

Positivity of the discriminant on the ‘regularity vector’ ensures regularity of the multi-center
conﬁguration.

3.1 Some generalities

It has long been argued that a D4 brane splits into a bound state of a D6 brane and an
anti-D6 brane [18]. In an M-Theory setting of the case at hand, it has proved to be very
diﬃcult to write down elliptic genera for the MSW CFTs with multiple M5 branes. Therefore,
in what follows, I will consider only those with a single M5 brane. This means a unit D4
brane charge in the charge vector. Indeed, from the charge vector (3.3), considering a D6
brane with one unit ﬂux and a ¯D6 with no ﬂux yields a D4 brane charge vector with induced
lower dimensional ﬂuxes:

(3.7)

– 11 –

Of course, as a consistency check, this must match with the appropriate induced ﬂuxes on
the D4 brane that cancel the Freed-Witten anomaly; this is indeed satisﬁed. For example,
specifying to the quintic threefold, which has k = 5 and c2 · P = 50, this charge vector
produces the correct ﬂuxes known from [13]. One can now compute the interaction degrees
of freedom between these two centers and check if it matches with what one expects from
modularity. Before that however, consider the Θγ decomposition of the partition function
again:

n(cid:88)

Z (q, ¯q, y) =

Zγ (q) Θγ (q, ¯q, y) .

(3.8)

γ=0

One property of this decomposition is that Zγ = Zδ for all γ = −δ modulo a pull-back of
the second integer cohomology onto the D4 brane. For the quintic for instance, n = 4 and
Z1 = Z4, Z2 = Z3. Now, the pure D4 brane degeneracy appears as the ﬁrst (or most polar)
term in the q-expansion of Z0.

Symmetric product orbifolds and adding D0 charges

To go to the next term in the expansion, one simply adds D0 charge. Thinking geometrically,
the D0 brane has a moduli space of the entire threefold in consideration and demanding a
bound-state with the D4 reduces the moduli space of a the latter; the combined moduli space
yields the correct degeneracy [13]. Adding more and more D0 charges results in symmetric
product orbifolds of the moduli space of the D0 particles, namely the threefold. Owing
to conﬁgurations with coinciding branes, one runs into singularities on the moduli space
that need to be resolved. As was pointed out in [16], the rational reﬁned indices overcome
these subtleties of moduli space singularites. From a multi-center conﬁguration perspective,
adding D0 charges implies an increase in the number of centers in a conﬁguration. And
there are exponentially many of them; the number growing with the number of partitions of
the D0 charge to be added. Nevertheless, the low-lying spectrum can still be handled. And
considering all conﬁgurations satisfying regularity, an addition of D0 charges takes us towards
the non-polar sector of Z0. I will work out explicit examples in the next subsection to show
that counting degrees of freedom associated to all regular conﬁgurations produces the correct
polar terms.

Rational curves and adding D2 charges
In order to move ‘vertically’, so to speak, into the degeneracies in Z1, one adds D2 charges.
Thinking geometrically again, adding D2 charges is equivalent to demanding that the D4
brane passing through rational curves. So, one computes the moduli space associated to de-
gree ‘β’ rational curves in conjunction with a demand that the D4 brane intersect them. D2
ﬂuxes, however, induce D0 charges and the amount of induced charge had to be computed
using techniques of algebraic geometry. Even in attempts to obtain the elliptic genera from
supergravity split-attractor ﬂows [38], the amount of induced charge was needed as an input

– 12 –

from geometry to identify the appropriate ﬂows that contribute to the index. Notwithstand-
ing this input, consider the most polar10 term in the q-expansion of Z1, say q−y. Writing this
term as q−xqz, such that −x + z = −y with q−x being the most polar term in Z0, it turns
out to be suﬃcient to consider added D0 charge that corresponds to the positive integer part
of z.11 In the several examples under consideration, it is suﬃcient to consider rational curves
of degree 1 and all polar terms of such kind have z > 1; I leave the cases with higher degree
rational curves for future work. Positivity of (z − 1) has a geometric interpretation: it is that
rational curves come with non-trivial moduli spaces only upon an induction of D0 charges.
In fact, in the theory of Donaldson-Thomas invariants—where a Witten index enumerates
invariants NDT (β, n) associated to a D2 brane wrapping a curve in the homology class β that
intersects a collection of points ascribed to D0 branes—there are no topological invariants
associated to NDT (1, 0) when z > 1. That the index is correctly reproduced by looking
at multi-center conﬁgurations with added D0 charges as I prescribe may be interpreted as
supergravity’s way of telling us that NDT (1, 0) = 0 whenever z > 1.

In view of the previous discussion on adding D0 charges, it is tempting to guess that
adding D2 charges must involve adding additional centers to charge conﬁgurations. Interest-
ingly, a simple argument shows that a generic D2 − D0 charge vector never binds to a D6
center. Consider generic D6 and D2 − D0 charge vectors as follows

where the second line is true up to some numerical factors and only holds in the large volume
limit J (cid:29) 0 for a threefold with positive triple-intersection k > 0. Wherever it needs speci-
ﬁcation, I make an arbitrary choice for the vacuum value of the modulus t at inﬁnity to be
t = 0 + 3i; this satisﬁes the large volume condition J (cid:29) B. Since the FI constants now have
10It may be worth pointing out that not all partition functions necessarily have a polar term in the q-

expansion of Z1.

11Note that z is not necessarily positive.

– 13 –

the opposite sign of the symplectic product of the corresponding charges, the integrability
equations for the bound state implies that r12 < 0, which violates regularity. This implies
that a bound state of D6 with a generic D2 − D0 charge never occurs! One might imagine
that a three center bound-state of a generic D2 − D0 center with D6 − ¯D6 might still be
possible. Although it is hard to prove in full generality, one might take the previous argument
as an indication that such three-center bound states generically violate regularity. In the next
subsection, I explicitly show that this is true in several examples.

Since it is only the relative distance between the centers that is important, I ﬁx z1 to be at
the origin. The above solution then implies that z2 is at a distance of ±z12 from the origin on
the axis on which the centers are localized. This leaves us with two possible conﬁgurations,
namely: 12 and 21, where z1 < z2 and z2 < z1 respectively.13 For consistency, the discrimi-
nant associated to the two-center conﬁguration must be positive. This requires the knowledge
of β—with an arbitrary choice of the value for the modulus at inﬁnity to be t = 0 + 3i as

12In fact, computing the discriminant associated to the D6 center also yields a negative value: −3125/1944. I
expect that the ignored instanton corrections to the prepotential lift this sickness; working with this hypothesis,
I merely shift the deﬁnition of a ‘zero discriminant’ from Dγ = 0 to that of the D6 brane. Aside from this
subtlety, the instanton corrections play no other role in the analysis.

13In the conﬁguration 12, z2 = +z12 and in the conﬁguration 21, z2 = −z12

understanding that a D6 and a ¯D6 have reﬁned indices of 1 each15 yields a ﬁnal index of

D6

¯D6 = 5 × 1 × 1 = 5.
¯ΩS

(3.22)

This matches the prediction from the string regime and modularity; the most polar term in
Z0 is the pure D4 brane. The ﬁnal index being exactly the same as the norm of the symplectic
inner product of the two charge vectors is not a mere coincidence. This is a generic feature
of two center solutions to the integrability equations.

D4-D0 bound state
As advertised in the previous subsection, the next polar term in Z0 may be achieved by
adding a D0 brane center. Three-center solutions of D0 branes bound to D6 and ¯D6 centers
have been extensively studied in [17]. While the D6 centers considered there were both with
D4 ﬂuxes turned on, the analysis is largely similar. It has also been previously noted that
Dp−6 branes bound to Dp branes energetically prefer to stay ejected from them as opposed
to dissolving as ﬂuxes as preferred by Dp−2 and Dp−4 branes. This is consistent with the
picture in [17] that adding a D0 charge necessarily implies an addition of a new D0 center
with charge vector αD0 = (0, 0, 0,±1). The correct sign may be ﬁxed by noting that adding
a positive D0 ﬂux on the Pure D4 reduces the entropy via a reduction in D. Therefore, in
these conventions, a D4 brane binds to an anti-D0 brane. Therefore, the three-problem of
interest now has a third center γ3 := (0, 0, 0,−1) in addition to the two centers that generated
a pure D4 brane. These result in a total charge vector given by

• A four center scenario with two explicit D0 centers:

The contributing centers are the previous D6 and ¯D6 centers with two explicit unit
charge D0 charge vectors. The total charge vector is clearly the same as before. A
detailed computation is no more illuminating to present here; the resulting gref in this
scenario is half that of the previous case, owing to the halving of the symplectic products.
The degeneracy for this four center D6- ¯D6-D0-D0 solution is gref = 3. This yields a
ﬁnal index of

where the factor of half comes from the automorphism arising from the two identical
D0 centers. This results in a total contribution of -1500 + 60000 = 58500, towards this
state. All these numbers are clearly consistent with the modular prediction for Z0.

Once one has identiﬁed the appropriate centers that are of interest, the authors of [39] have
developed a Mathematica code for the computation of the Poincare polynomials. The code
is attached to their paper.

D6- ¯D6-D2D0 bound states
To move into the polar sector of Z1, now, one must add D2 charges. Naively, this added
charge may merely be an increase in the D2 component of either of the D6 brane charges
or act as an additional third center, with possible additional induced D0 centers. The split
attractor ﬂow allows for such ﬂows into many channels [18].
In fact, in the large volume
limit—the one I stick to in this article—one can even compute the index across the wall of
marginal stability along the ﬂow [40]; for an end point with three centers—which I will think
of being the two D6 centers along with a generic D2D0 center (0, 0, q, q0)—is given by [40]

upon computing the corresponding quantities in the underbraces. For a non-vanishing index,
sgn [a] and sgn [b] must have the same sign (and similarly with sgn [c] and sgn [d]). sgn [a] and
sgn [b] have the same sign iﬀ −5 < q0 < 20, where I use the fact that q & q0 ∈ Z. Therefore,
if this condition is satisﬁed, sgn [a] + sgn [b] = −2. For the total contribution to the index to
be positive18, sgn [c] and sgn [d] < 0. Since γ12 = −q − q0,

sgn [d] = sgn [γ12] = −sgn [q + q0] .

(3.39)
Now sgn [d] < 0 implies q > −q0. Putting all the pieces together, the allowed values for the
center γ2 such that there is a non-vanishing contribution to the index are collected in Table 8.
It is evident that in the direction of the physical D0 charges that bind with the D4, there
are no non-vanishing D2 charges to form a three-center black hole bound state. Nevertheless,
one might still investigate if D0 charges of the opposite sign can form the third center with

non-vanishing D2 charges. As it turns out, none of the allowed values in Table 8 result in
a positive discriminant. This rules out the possibility of having a three center bound state
with non-vanishing D2 charges. This may be seen as a more precise vindication of the naive
argument I presented in the previous subsection.

In so far as the modiﬁed elliptic genus is concerned, this means that a polar term with
D2 charges can occur only as a two-center conﬁguration where one of the centers has addi-
tional D2 and D0 ﬂuxes. To identify which of the two centers picks up the additional lower
dimensional charges, I again look for the charge vectors whose discriminant increases upon
the addition of the said charges to ﬁnd the conﬁguration to be

terms under consideration in the examples.

4 Discussion

In this article, I have identiﬁed all multi-center conﬁgurations (whose total charge vectors
violate the naive single-center cosmic censorship bound) that build the polar sector of several
elliptic genera of Calabi-Yau threefolds with maximal holonomy. It is natural to expect that
once one moves into the non-polar sector of the theory, when total charge vectors no longer
violate the cosmic-censorship bound, single center black holes begin to contribute. Exactly
what states these constitute is not fully known. Several interesting suggestions have been

– 23 –

made [41, 42, 43, 44] in the literature. Nevertheless, large charge single-center black hole
entropy has not been easy to understand concretely, with these suggestions.

With the prescription I have proposed in this article, one may now seek to push into the
non-polar sector of the elliptic genus to understand single-center black hole entropy. Naively,
the approach from split-ﬂows proposed in [38, 44] might have been a good starting point to
push deep into the non-polar sector. As one increases charge, there is an expectation that an
increasing number of multi-center conﬁgurations must contribute to the index. For instance,
moving on from a D4-D0 charge vector to a D4-2D0 charge vector, one expects two diﬀerent
contributions: one from a three center D6- ¯D6-2D0 solution and another from a four center
D6- ¯D6-D0-D0 conﬁguration. The authors of [38, 44], however, argue for only a single ﬂow.
On the contrary, I show explicitly in (3.35) and (3.36) that both the expected conﬁgurations
do indeed contribute to produce the correct polar term.
In extension, enumeration of all
multi-center conﬁgurations can systematically be done with the approach I present in this ar-
ticle. It may be noted that a more general prescription might be needed to incorporate higher
degree rational curves to include more D2 charges with appropriately induced D0 charges.
Nevertheless, it is my hope that this enables for a better understanding of the non-polar sector.

Although I have refrained from stressing on them, there are several aspects of purely
mathematical interest that are very closely related to the study of BPS states mentioned in
this article. The elliptic genera studied in this article encode topological invariants of the
moduli space of the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Some
questions in this ﬁeld related to this article are: What is the generating function for the
Euler numbers of the moduli space of stable sheaves (seen as objects in the derived category
of coherent sheaves where stability is usually thought to be Bridgeland stability as in the
Kontsevich-Soibelman setup) on a smooth three-dimensional quasi-projective variety? What
is the generating function for the Betti numbers for the same? G¨ottsche has answered both
these questions for sky-scraper sheaves on smooth two-dimensional quasi-projective varieties
[45]. In the mid-nineties, Cheah [46] managed to write a generating function (the McMahon
function) for the Euler numbers of the moduli space of stable sky-scraper sheaves on smooth
three dimensional quasi-projective varieties. A reﬁnement of Cheah’s result in the spirit of
G¨ottsche is expected to be related to single-center black hole entropies. While hoping for a
general result might be far fetched from the explicit multi-center prescription presented in
this article, I speculate that it may well prove to be very helpful in conjuring up and testing
conjectures [41, 42] in this regard.

Another branch of mathematical interest that is closely related is the study of Poincar´e
polynomials of quiver representation spaces. A K¨ahler manifold is endowed with a natural
Sl2 Lefschetz action on the cohomology. And the generating function of the Euler numbers
mentioned above captures this action because Euler numbers are, after all, characterized
by the cohomology. However, the reﬁned generating function of the Betti numbers exactly

– 24 –

organizes BPS states into diﬀerent representations of the Lefschetz action. States invariant
under this action have been conjectured to be special, in that they are expected to capture
single-center black hole entropy. With the results presented in this article, one may identify
the Lefschetz singlets in the low-lying non-polar terms to test the conjecture of [41, 43] that
Pure-Higgs states make up single-center indices in all the above examples. The Poincar´e
polynomials studied in the mathematics literature that encode these invariants are based on
Reinike’s solution to the Harder-Narasimhan recursion for quivers without oriented closed
loops. However, the indices used in this article, originally proposed in [40, 39], applies to
those with or without closed loops. It would be interesting to understand a mathematical
counterpart of the latter, as extensions of Reinike’s results. On the other hand, one may seek
to understand a pattern of growth of multi-center entropies to compare against asymptotic
behaviour of states under various representations that has been predicted in [15].
