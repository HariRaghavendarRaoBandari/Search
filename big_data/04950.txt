Abstract— This paper surveys some recent results on the
theory of quantum linear systems and presents them within
a uniﬁed framework. Quantum linear systems are a class of
systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of
quantum mechanics, take the speciﬁc form of a set of linear
quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). Such sys-
tems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics and related
disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described or ap-
proximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical
cavities, beam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric am-
pliﬁers, optical squeezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic
systems. With advances in quantum technology, the feedback
control of such quantum systems is generating new challenges
in the ﬁeld of control theory. Potential applications of such
quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing,
quantum error correction, quantum communications, gravity
wave detection, metrology, atom lasers, and superconducting
quantum circuits.

A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of
quantum linear systems involves the use of a controller which
itself is a quantum linear system. This approach to quantum
feedback control, referred to as coherent quantum feedback
control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum
information, is fast, and has the potential for efﬁcient imple-
mentation. This paper discusses recent results concerning the
synthesis of H-inﬁnity optimal controllers for linear quantum
systems in the coherent control case. An important issue which
arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems and
in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the
issue of physical realizability. This issue relates to the property
of whether a given set of QSDEs corresponds to a physical
quantum system satisfying the laws of quantum mechanics. The
paper will cover recent results relating the question of physical
realizability to notions occuring in linear systems theory such
as lossless bounded real systems and dual J-J unitary systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

Developments in quantum technology and quantum infor-
mation provide an important motivation for research in the
area of quantum feedback control systems; e.g., see [1]–[7].
In particular, in recent years, there has been considerable
interest
in the feedback control and modeling of linear
quantum systems; e.g., see [3], [5], [5], [8]–[26]. Such linear
quantum systems commonly arise in the area of quantum
optics; e.g., see [27]–[29]. Feedback control of quantum
optical systems has applications in areas such as quantum
communications, quantum teleportation, and gravity wave
detection. In particular, linear quantum optics is one of the

possible platforms being investigated for future communica-
tion systems (see [30], [31]) and quantum computers (see
[32], [33] and [34]). Feedback control of quantum systems
aims to achieve closed loop properties such as stability [35],
[36], robustness [11], [37], entanglement [18], [38], [39].

Quantum linear system models have been used in the
physics and mathematical physics literature since the 1980’s;
e.g., see [26], [28], [40]–[42]. An important class of linear
quantum stochastic models describe the Heisenberg evolution
of the (canonical) position and momentum, or annihilation
and creation operators of several independent open quantum
harmonic oscillators that are coupled to external coherent
bosonic ﬁelds, such as coherent laser beams; e.g., see [27],
[26], [28], [8], [10], [9], [11]–[13], [17], [18], [22], [25],
[43], [44]). These linear stochastic models describe quantum
optical devices such as optical cavities [29], [27], linear
quantum ampliﬁers [28], and ﬁnite bandwidth squeezers
[28]. Following [11], [12], [22], we will refer to this class
of models as linear quantum stochastic systems. In par-
ticular, we consider linear quantum stochastic differential
equations driven by quantum Wiener processes; see [28].
Further details on quantum stochastic differential equations
and quantum Wiener processes can be found in [40], [42],
[45].

This paper will survey some of the available results on
the feedback control of linear quantum systems and related
problems. An important class of quantum feedback control
systems involves the use of measurement devices to obtain
classical output signals from the quantum system and no
quantum measurements is involved. These classical signals
are fed into a classical controller which may be implemented
via analog or digital electronics and then the resulting control
signal act on the quantum system via an actuator. However,
some recent papers on the feedback control of linear quantum
systems have considered the case in which the feedback con-
troller itself is also a quantum system. Such feedback control
is often referred to as coherent quantum control; e.g., see [5],
[6], [11], [12], [14]–[17], [46]–[48]. Due to the limitations
imposed by quantum mechanics on the use of quantum mea-
surement, the use of coherent quantum feedback control may
lead to improved control system performance. In addition, in
many applications, coherent quantum feedback controllers
may be preferable to classical feedback controllers due to
considerations of speed and ease of implementation.

One motivation for considering such coherent quantum
control problems is that coherent controllers have the po-
tential
to achieve improved performance since quantum
measurements inherently involve the destruction of quantum
information; e.g., see [34]. Also, technology is emerging

which will enable the implementation of complex coherent
quantum controllers (e.g., see [49]) and the coherent H ∞
controllers proposed in [11] have already been implemented
experimentally as described in [17]. Furthermore, coher-
ent controllers implemented using quantum optics have the
potential to operate at much higher speeds than classical
controllers implemented in analog or digital electronics.

In general, quantum linear stochastic systems represented
by linear Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations (QS-
DEs) with arbitrary constant coefﬁcients need not corre-
spond to physically meaningful systems. In contrast, because
classical linear stochastic systems can be implemented at
least approximately, using analog or digital electronics, we
regard them as always being realizable. Physical quantum
systems must satisfy some additional constraints that restrict
the allowable values for the system matrices deﬁning the
QSDEs. In particular, the laws of quantum mechanics dictate
that closed quantum systems evolve unitarily, implying that
(in the Heisenberg picture) certain canonical observables
satisfy the so-called canonical commutation relations (CCR)
at all times. Therefore, to characterize physically meaningful
systems, [11] has introduced a formal notion of physically
realizable quantum linear stochastic systems and derives a
pair of necessary and sufﬁcient characterizations for such
systems in terms of constraints on their system matrices.

In the paper [21], the physical realizability results of [14],
[15] are extended to the most general class of complex
linear QSDEs. It is shown that this class of linear quantum
systems corresponds to the class of real linear quantum
systems considered in [11] via the use of a suitable state
transformation.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In
Section II, we introduce the class of linear quantum stochas-
tic systems under consideration and consider a number of
different representations of these systems. We also introduce
a useful special class of linear quantum systems which was
considered in [14]–[16]. In Section III, we consider the
issue of physical realizability for the class of linear quantum
systems under consideration. In Section IV, we will consider
the problem of coherent H ∞ quantum controller synthesis.
In Section V, we present some conclusions.

II. LINEAR QUANTUM SYSTEM MODELS

In this section, we formulate the class of linear quantum
system models under consideration. These linear quantum
system models take the form of quantum stochastic differen-
tial equations which are derived from the quantum harmonic
oscillator.

A. Quantum Harmonic Oscillators

We begin by considering a collection of n independent
quantum harmonic oscillators which are deﬁned on a Hilbert
space H = L2(Rn, C); e.g., see [25], [42], [50]. Elements of
the Hilbert space H, ψ(x) are the standard complex valued
wave functions arising in quantum mechanics where x is a
spatial variable. Corresponding to this collection of harmonic

oscillators is a vector of annihilation operators

a1
a2
...
an

a =





.

(1)

Each annihilation operator ai is an unbounded linear operator
deﬁned on a suitable domain in H by
xiψ(x) +

(aiψ)(x) =

∂ψ(x)

1
√2

∂xi

1
√2

where ψ ∈ H is contained in the domain of the operator ai.
The adjoint of the operator ai is denoted a∗
i and is referred to
as a creation operator. The operators ai and a∗
i are such that
the following cannonical commutation relations are satisﬁed

[ai, a∗

j ] = aia∗

j − a∗

j ai = δij

(2)

where δij denotes the kronecker delta multiplied by the
identity operator on the Hilbert space H. We also have the
commutation relations

[ai, aj] = 0, [a∗

i , a∗

j ] = 0.

(3)

For a general vector of operators

g =

on H, we use the notation
g# =


g2

gn

g∗

to denote the corresponding vector of adjoint operators. Also,
gT denotes the corresponding row vector of operators gT =

g2

. . .

the canonical commutation relations (2), (3) can be written
as

gn (cid:3), and g† =(cid:0)g#(cid:1)T . Using this notation,
a# (cid:21)†# = (cid:20) a

− (cid:20) a
0 −I (cid:21) .

0

a# (cid:21)T!T

(4)

A state on our system of quantum harmonic oscillators
is deﬁned by a density operator ρ which is a self-adjoint
positive-semideﬁnite operator on H with tr(ρ) = 1; e.g., see
[34]. Corresponding to a state ρ and an operator g on H is
the quantum expectation

hgi = tr(ρg).

A state on the system is said to be Gaussian with positive-
semideﬁnite covariance matrix Q ∈ C2n×2n and mean
vector α ∈ Cn if given any vector u ∈ Cn,
a# (cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:29)

(cid:28)exp(cid:18)i(cid:2) u† uT (cid:3)(cid:20) a

of the complex vector u, uT denotes the transpose of the
complex vector u, and u† denotes the complex conjugate
transpose of the complex vector u.

Note that in the zero mean case, α = 0, the covariance

matrix Q satisﬁes

Q =*(cid:20) a

a# (cid:21)(cid:20) a

a# (cid:21)†+ .

In the special case in which the covariance matrix Q is of
the form

Q =(cid:20) I

0 (cid:21)

and the mean α = 0, the system is said to be in the vacuum
state. In the sequel, it will be assumed that the state on
the system of harmonic oscillators is a Gaussian vacuum
state. The state on the system of harmonic oscillators plays
a similar role to the probability distribution of the initial
conditions of a classical stochastic system.

The quantum harmonic oscillators described above are
assumed to be coupled to m external independent quan-
tum ﬁelds modelled by bosonic annihilation ﬁeld operators
A1(t),A2(t), . . . ,Am(t) which are deﬁned on separate Fock
spaces Fi deﬁned over L2(R) for each ﬁeld operator [39],
[40], [42], [45]. For each annihilation ﬁeld operator Aj (t),
there is a corresponding creation ﬁeld operator A∗
j (t), which
is deﬁned on the same Fock space and is the operator adjoint
of Aj(t). The ﬁeld operators are adapted quantum stochastic
processes with forward differentials

dAj (t) = Aj(t + dt) − Aj(t)

and

dA∗

j (t) = A∗

j (t + dt) − A∗

j (t)

that have the quantum Itˆo products [39], [40], [42], [45]:

dAj (t)dAk(t)∗ = δjkdt;
dA∗
j (t)dAk(t) = 0;
dAj (t)dAk(t) = 0;
dA∗
k(t) = 0.

j (t)dA∗

The ﬁeld annilation operators are also collected into a vector
of operators deﬁned as follows:

A(t) =


A1(t)
A2(t)

...

Am(t)

.




For each i, the corresponding system state on the Fock
space Fi is assumed to be a Gaussian vacuum state which
means that given any complex valued function ui(t) ∈
L2(R, C), then
ui(t)dAi(t)∗(cid:19)(cid:29)

(cid:28)exp(cid:18)iZ ∞

In order to describe the joint evolution of the quantum
harmonic oscillators and quantum ﬁelds, we ﬁrst specify the
Hamiltonian operator for the quantum system which is a
Hermitian operator on H of the form

where M ∈ C2n×2n is a Hermitian matrix of the form

H =

1

1 (cid:21)
M =(cid:20) M1 M2

2 M #

M #

1 , M2 = M T

and M1 = M †
2 . Here, M † denotes the complex
conjugate transpose of the complex matrix M , M T denotes
the transpose of the complex matrix M , and M # denotes
the complex conjugate of the complex matrix M . Also, we
specify the coupling operator for the quantum system to be
an operator of the form

L =(cid:2) N1 N2 (cid:3)(cid:20) a
a# (cid:21)
a# (cid:21) =(cid:20) N1 N2

where N1 ∈ Cm×n and N2 ∈ Cm×n. Also, we write
a# (cid:21) .
1 (cid:21)(cid:20) a

L# (cid:21) = N(cid:20) a
(cid:20) L

2 N #

In addition, we deﬁne a scattering matrix which is a unitary
matrix S ∈ Cn×n. These quantities then deﬁne the joint evo-
lution of the quantum harmonic oscillators and the quantum
ﬁelds according to a unitary adapted process U (t) (which is
an operator valued function of time) satisfying the Hudson-
Parthasarathy QSDE [23], [40], [42], [45]:

dU (t) = (cid:0)tr(cid:2)(S − I)T dΛ(t)(cid:3) + dA(t)†L − L†SdA(t)

L†L)dt(cid:19) U (t); U (0) = I,

− (iH +

where Λ(t) = [Λjk(t)]j,k=1,...,m. Here, the processes Λjk(t)
for j, k = 1, . . . , m are adapted quantum stochastic processes
referred to as gauge processes, and the forward differentials
dΛjk(t) = Λjk(t + dt) − Λjk(t) j, k = 1, . . . , m have the
quantum Itˆo products:

dΛjk(t)dΛj ′ k′ (t) = δkj ′ dΛjk′ (t);

dAj(t)dΛkl(t) = δjkdAl(t);
dΛjkdAl(t)∗ = δkldA∗
j (t).

Then, using the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics,
the harmonic oscillator operators ai(t) evolve with time
unitarily according to

ai(t) = U (t)∗aiU (t)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Also, the linear quantum system output
ﬁelds are given by

Aout
for i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

i

(t) = U (t)∗Ai(t)U (t)

We now use the fact that for any adapted processes X(t)
and Y (t) satisfying a quantum Itˆo stochastic differential
equation, we have the quantum Itˆo rule

dX(t)Y (t) = X(t)dY (t) + dX(t)Y (t) + dX(t)dY (t);

e.g., see [42]. Using the quantum Itˆo rule and the quantum
Itˆo products given above, as well as exploiting the canonical
commutation relations between the operators in a, the fol-
lowing QSDEs decribing the linear quantum system can be
obtained (e.g., see [25]):

From this, we can write

Note that matrices of the form (8) occur commonly in the

establish the following lemma which characterizes matrices

The QSDEs (12), (13), (16) deﬁne the general class
of linear quantum systems considered in this paper. Such
quantum systems can be used to model a large range of
devices and networks of devices arising in the area of
quantum optics including optical cavities, squeezers, optical
parametric ampliﬁers, cavity QED systems, beam splitters,
and phase shifters; e.g., see [3], [5], [6], [11], [17], [19],
[22], [24], [26]–[29], [48].

B. Annihilation operator linear quantum systems

An important special case of the linear quantum systems
(12), (13), (16) corresponds to the case in which the Hamil-
tonian operator H and coupling operator L depend only of
the vector of annihilation operators a and not on the vector of
creation operators a#. This class of linear quantum systems
is considered in [14]–[17], [19], [20], [51] and can be used
to model “passive” quantum optical devices such as optical
cavities, beam splitters, phase shifters and interferometers.
This class of linear quantum systems corresponds to the
case in which ˜M2 = 0, ˜N2 = 0, and T2 = 0. In this case,
the linear quantum system can be modelled by the QSDEs

d˜a(t) = ˜F ˜a(t)dt + ˜GdA(t)
dAout(t) = ˜H˜a(t)dt + ˜KdA(t)

C. Position and momentum operator linear quantum systems
Note that the matrices in the general QSDEs (12), (13)
are in general complex. However, it is possible to apply a
particular change of variables to the system (5) so that all
of the matrices in the resulting transformed QSDEs are real.
This change of variables is deﬁned as follows:

(cid:20) q
p (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) a
a# (cid:21) ;
(cid:20) Q(t)
P(t) (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) A(t)
A(t)# (cid:21) ;
(cid:20) Qout(t)
P out(t) (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) Aout(t)
Aout(t)# (cid:21)

where the matrices Φ have the form

Furthermore, Qout(t) and P out(t) are the vectors of position
and momentum operators for the output quantum noise ﬁelds.

It follows from (22) that

ΦΦ† = 2I

(23)

and hence

Φ−1Φ−† =

1
2

I.

(24)

Rather than applying the transformations (21) to the
quantum linear system (7) which satisﬁes the canonical
commutation relations (4), corresponding transformations
can be applied to the quantum linear system (12) which
satisﬁes the generalized commutation relations (11). These
transformations are as follows:

(cid:20) ˜q
˜p (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) ˜a
˜a# (cid:21) ;
(cid:20) Q(t)
P(t) (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) A(t)
A(t)# (cid:21) ;
(cid:20) Qout(t)
P out(t) (cid:21) = Φ(cid:20) Aout(t)
Aout(t)# (cid:21) .

(25)

When these transformations are applied to the quantum linear
system (12), this leads to the following real quantum linear
system:

(21)

Φ =(cid:20)

iI (cid:21)

and have the appropriate dimensions. Here q is a vector of
the self-adjoint position operators for the system of harmonic
oscillators and p is a vector of momentum operators; e.g.,
see [11], [12], [21], [39]. Also, Q(t) and P(t) are the
vectors of position and momentum operators for the quantum
noise ﬁelds acting on the system of harmonic oscillators.

(cid:20) d˜q(t)
d˜p(t) (cid:21) = A(cid:20) ˜p(t)
(cid:20) dQout(t)
dP out(t) (cid:21) = C(cid:20) ˜q(t)

˜q(t) (cid:21) dt + B(cid:20) dQ(t)
dP(t) (cid:21) ;
˜p(t) (cid:21) dt + D(cid:20) dP(t)
dQ(t) (cid:21) ,

above that ˜K ˜K † = I and ˜KJ ˜K † = J. Hence, as in Section
II-A the matrix ˜K must be of the form in (16). Thus, the
matrix D must be of the form in (34).

III. PHYSICAL REALIZABILITY

Not all QSDEs of the form (12), (13) correspond to
physical quantum systems. This motivates a notion of phys-
ical realizability which has been considered in the papers
[11], [12], [14]–[16], [19]–[21], [38], [51]. This notion is of
particular importance in the problem of coherent quantum
feedback control in which the controller itself is a quantum
system. In this case, if a controller is synthesized using
a method such as quantum H ∞ control [11], [14], [16]
or quantum LQG control [12], [38], it important that the
controller can be implemented as a physical quantum system

[19], [22]. We ﬁrst consider the issue of physical realizability
in the case of general linear quantum systems and then
we consider the issue of physical realizability for the case
of annihilator operator linear quantum system of the form
considered in Subsection II-B.

A. Physical realizability for general linear quantum systems
The formal deﬁnition of physically realizable QSDEs
requires that they can be realized as a system of quantum
harmonic oscillators.

Deﬁnition 1: QSDEs of the form (12), (13) are physically
realizable if there exist complex matrices Θ = Θ†, ˜M =
˜M †, ˜N , S such that S†S = I, Θ is of the form in (10), ˜M
is of the form in (15), and (16) is satisﬁed.

A version of the following theorem was presented in [21];

see also [11], [12] for related results.

Theorem 1: The QSDEs (12), (13) are physically realiz-
able if and only if there exists a complex matrix Θ = Θ† of
the form in (10) such that

˜F Θ + Θ ˜F † + ˜GJ ˜G† = 0;
˜G = −Θ ˜H †J ˜K;
˜KJ ˜K † = J;
˜K ˜K † = I.

Proof:

(37)
If there exist matrices Θ = Θ†, ˜M = ˜M †,
˜N , S such that S†S = I, ˜M is of the form in (15), Θ is
of the form in (10), and (16) is satisﬁed, then it follows by
straightforward substitution that the ﬁrst equation in (37) will
be satisﬁed and

0

0 −S# (cid:21) ;

˜G = −Θ ˜H †(cid:20) S
˜K =(cid:20) S
0 S# (cid:21) .

0

(38)

Then, the remaining equations in (37) follow using (17) and
(18).

Converely, suppose there exists a complex matrix Θ = Θ†
of the form in (10) such that (37) is satisﬁed. Also, as shown
at the end of Section II.A, the conditions ˜KJ ˜K † = J and
˜K ˜K † = I imply that there exists a complex matrix S such

Also, let

that S†S = I and ˜K is of the form ˜K =(cid:20) S
2(cid:16)Θ−1 ˜F − ˜F †Θ−1(cid:17) ;

˜M =

˜N = ˜H.

i

0

0 S# (cid:21) .

It is straightforward to verify that this matrix ˜M is Hermitian.
Also, it follows from (37) that

˜G = −Θ ˜N †(cid:20) S

0 −S# (cid:21)

0

as required. Furthermore, using S†S = I, it now follows that

˜GJ ˜G† = Θ ˜N †J ˜N Θ.

Hence, (37) implies

˜F Θ + Θ ˜F † + Θ ˜N †J ˜N Θ = 0

and hence

˜F †Θ−1 = −Θ−1 ˜F − ˜N †J ˜N

From this, it follows that

and hence,

˜M =

i

2(cid:16)2Θ−1 ˜F + ˜N †J ˜N(cid:17)

˜F = −iΘ ˜M −

1
2

Θ ˜N †J ˜N

as required. Hence, (16) is satisﬁed.

We now use Lemma 1 to show that ˜M is of the form in
(15). Indeed, we have T Σ = ΣT #, T #Σ = ΣT , T −1Σ =
Σ = ΣT −1, ˜F Σ = Σ ˜F #, ˜F #Σ = Σ ˜F ,

Σ(cid:0)T #(cid:1)−1, (cid:0)T #(cid:1)−1
and ΣJ = −JΣ. Hence,
Σ ˜M # = −

i

2  Σ(cid:0)T T(cid:1)−1

J(cid:0)T #(cid:1)−1 !
J(cid:0)T #(cid:1)−1 ˜F #
J T −1 ! Σ

i

=

= ˜M Σ.

Therefore, it follows from Lemma 1 that ˜M is of the form
in (15) and hence, the QSDEs (12), (13) are physically
realizable.

Remark 1: In the canonical case when T = I and Θ = J,

the physical realizability equations (37) become

˜F J + J ˜F † + ˜GJ ˜G† = 0;
˜G = −J ˜H †J ˜K;
˜KJ ˜K † = J;
˜K ˜K † = I.

(39)
Following the approach of [21], we now relate the physical
realizability of the QSDEs (12), (13) to the dual (J, J)-
unitary property of the corresponding transfer function ma-
trix

Γ(s) =(cid:20) Γ11(s) Γ12(s)

Γ21(s) Γ22(s) (cid:21) = ˜H(cid:16)sI − ˜F(cid:17)−1

(40)
Deﬁnition 2: (See [21], [52].) A transfer function matrix

˜G + ˜K.

Γ(s) of the form (40) is dual (J, J)-unitary if

Γ(s)JΓ∼(s) = J

for all s ∈ C+.
Here, Γ∼(s) = Γ(−s∗)† and C+ denotes the set {s ∈ C :
ℜ[s] ≥ 0}.
Theorem 2: The transfer function matrix (40) correspond-
ing to the QSDEs (12), (13) is dual (J, J)-unitary if and only
if

˜KJ ˜K † = J,

and there exists a Hermitian matrix Θ such that

˜F Θ + Θ ˜F † + ˜GJ ˜G† = 0;
˜KJ ˜G† + ˜HΘ = 0.

(41)

(42)

Theorem 3 (See also [21].): If the QSDEs (12), (13) are
physically realizable, then the corresponding transfer func-
tion matrix (40) is dual (J, J)-unitary.

Conversely, suppose the QSDEs (12), (13) satisfy the

following conditions:

(i) The transfer function matrix (40) corresponding to the

QSDEs (12), (13) is dual (J, J)-unitary;

(ii)

˜K ˜K † = I;

(43)

(iii) The Hermitian matrix Θ satisfying (42) is of the form

in (10).

Then, the QSDEs (12), (13) are physically realizable.

Proof: If the QSDEs (12), (13) are physically realizable,
then it follows from Theorem 1 that there exist complex
matrices Θ = Θ† and S such that S†S = I and equations
(37) are satisﬁed. However, ˜KJ ˜K † = J and ˜K ˜K † = I
imply ˜KJ = J ˜K and hence, it follows from (37) that

˜KJ ˜G† + ˜HΘ = 0.

That is, the conditions (42) are satisﬁed and hence it fol-
lows from Theorem 2 that the transfer function matrix (40)
corresponding to the QSDEs (12), (13) is dual (J, J)-unitary.
Conversely, if the QSDEs (12), (13) satisfy conditions (i)
- (iii) of the theorem, then it follows from Theorem 2 that
there exists a Hermitian matrix Θ of the form in (10) such
that equations (42) are satisﬁed. Hence,

˜KJ ˜G† + ˜HΘ = 0.

(44)

Furthermore, we have ˜KJ ˜K † = J and ˜K ˜K † = I and
therefore ˜KJ = J ˜K. Hence, (44) implies

˜G† + ˜K †J ˜HΘ = 0.

From this it follows that equations (37) are satisﬁed. Thus,
it follows from Theorem 1 that the QSDEs (12), (13) are
physically realizable.

B. Physical realizability for annihilator operator linear
quantum systems

For annilhilator operator linear quantum systems described
by QSDEs of the form (19) the corresponding formal deﬁ-
nition of physical realizability is as follows.

Deﬁnition 3: (See [14], [15], [51].) The QSDEs of the
form (19) are said to be physically realizable if there exist
1 , ˜N , and S such that
matrices Θ1 = Θ†
S†S = I and (20) is satisﬁed.

1 > 0, ˜M1 = ˜M †

The following theorem from [14], [15], [51] gives a

characterization of physical realizability in this case.

Theorem 4: The QSDEs (19) are physically realizable if
1 > 0 such

and only if there exists a complex matrix Θ1 = Θ†
that

˜F Θ1 + Θ1 ˜F † + ˜G ˜G† = 0;
˜G = −Θ1 ˜H † ˜K;
˜K † ˜K = I.

(45)

In the case of QSDEs of the form (19), the issue of
physical realizability is determined by the lossless bounded
real property of the corresponding transfer function matrix

Γ(s) = ˜H(sI − ˜F )−1 ˜G + ˜K.

(46)

Deﬁnition 4: (See also [53].) The transfer function matrix
(46) corresponding to the QSDEs (19) is said to be lossless
bounded real if the following conditions hold:

i) ˜F is a Hurwitz matrix; i.e., all of its eigenvalues have

strictly negative real parts;

ii)

Γ(iω)†Γ(iω) = I

for all ω ∈ R.

Deﬁnition 5: (See also, [14], [15], [51].) The QSDEs
(19) are said to deﬁne a minimal realization of the transfer
function matrix (46) if the following conditions hold:

i) Controllability;

ii) Observability;

rank(cid:2) ˜G ˜F ˜G ˜F 2 ˜G . . .

The following theorem, which is a complex version of the
standard lossless bounded real lemma, gives a state space
characterization of the lossless bounded real property.

Theorem 5: (Complex Lossless Bounded Real Lemma;
e.g., see [14], [15], [53]). Suppose the QSDEs (19) deﬁne
a minimal realization of the transfer function matrix (46).
Then the transfer function (46) is lossless bounded real if
and only if there exists a Hermitian matrix X > 0 such that

X ˜F + ˜F †X + ˜H † ˜H = 0;

˜H † ˜K = −X ˜G;
˜K † ˜K = I.

(47)
Combining Theorems 4 and 5 leads to the following result
which provides a complete characterization of the physical
realizability property for minimal QSDEs of the form (19).
Theorem 6: (See [14], [15], [51].) Suppose the QSDEs
(19) deﬁne a minimal realization of the transfer function
matrix (46). Then, the QSDEs (19) are physically realizable
if and only if the transfer function matrix (46) is lossless
bounded real.

C. Physical Realizability for Position and momentum oper-
ator linear quantum systems

It is often convenient to consider the physical realizability
of real quantum linear systems of the form (26). This can
be achieved by applying the transformations (25) and the
equations (34), (32), (33), (36), (35) to obtain the following
corollary of Theorem 1.

Corollary 1: (See also, [11], [12].) The QSDEs (26) are
physically realizable if and only if there exists a real matrix
˜Θ = − ˜ΘT such that

A ˜Θ + ˜ΘAT + B ˜J BT = 0;
B = ˜ΘC T ˜J D;
D ˜J DT = ˜J;
DDT = I.

(50)
Remark 2: For real QSDEs of the form (26) with corre-

sponding transfer function

Υ(s) = C(sI − A)−1B + D

It is straightforward using equations (25) to verify that this
transfer function is related to the transfer function (40) of the
corresponding complex QSDEs (12) according to the relation

Υ(s) = ΦΓ(s)Φ−1.

(51)

Now if the real QSDEs (26) are physically realizable, it
follows that the corresponding complex QSDEs (12), (13)
are physically realizable. Hence, using Theorem 3, it follows
that the corresponding transfer function matrix (40) is dual
(J, J)-unitary; i.e.,

Γ(s)JΓ∼(s) = J

for all s ∈ C+. Therefore, it follows from (51) and (32) that

Υ(s) ˜JΥ∼(s) = ˜J

for all s ∈ C+. Also, as in the discussion at the end of
Section II.C, the conditions (41), (43) are equivalent to the
conditions

D ˜J DT = ˜J;
DDT = I.

IV. COHERENT QUANTUM H ∞ CONTROL

In this section, we formulate a coherent quantum control
problem in which a linear quantum system is controlled
by a feedback controller which is itself a linear quantum
system. The fact that the controller is to be a quantum system
means that any controller synthesis method needs to produce
controllers which are physically realizable. The problem we
consider is the quantum H ∞ control problem in which it is
desired to design a coherent controller such that the resulting
closed loop quantum system is stable and attenuates speciﬁed
disturbances acting on the system; see [11], [14], [16]. In the
standard quantum H ∞ control problem such as considered
in [11], [14], [16], the quantum noises are averaged out and
only the external disturbance is considered.

A. Coherent H ∞ control of general quantum linear systems
In this subsection, we formulate the coherent quantum H ∞
control problem for a general class of quantum systems of
the form (12), (13).

We consider quantum plants described by linear complex
quantum stochastic models of the following form deﬁned in
an analogous way to the QSDEs (12), (13):

(cid:20) d˜a(t)
d˜a(t)# (cid:21) = F (cid:20) ˜a(t)

dv (t)
dw (t)

˜a(t)# (cid:21) dt
+(cid:2) G0 G1 G2 (cid:3)

du (t) 

0 (cid:3)


du (t) 
(52)

dz (t) = H1(cid:20) ˜a(t)
dy (t) = H2(cid:20) ˜a(t)

where all of the matrices in these QSDEs have a form as in
(13). Here, the input

dw(t) =(cid:20) βw(t)dt + dA(t)

w (t)dt + dA(t)# (cid:21)

β#

represents a disturbance signal where βw(t) is an adapted
process; see [11], [14], [42]. The signal u(t) is a control
input of the form

du(t) =(cid:20) βu(t)dt + dB(t)

u (t)dt + dB(t)# (cid:21)

β#

where βu(t) is an adapted process. The quantity

represents any additional quantum noise in the plant. The

dv(t) =(cid:20) dC(t)
dA(t)# (cid:21), (cid:20) dB(t)

dC(t)# (cid:21)
dB(t)# (cid:21) and (cid:20) dC(t)

dC(t)# (cid:21) are

quantities (cid:20) dA(t)

quantum noises of the form described in Section II.

In the coherent quantum H ∞ control problem, we consider
controllers which are described by QSDEs of the form (12),
(13) as follows:

dˆa(t)# (cid:21) = Fc(cid:20) ˆa(t)
(cid:20) dˆa(t)

where all of the matrices in these QSDEs have a form as in
(13). Here the quantities

dwc0 =(cid:20) dAc(t)

dAc(t)# (cid:21) , dwc1 =(cid:20) dBc(t)

dBc(t)# (cid:21)

are controller quantum noises of the form described in
Section II. Also, the ouputs du0 and du1 are unused outputs
of the controller which have been included so that
the
controller can satisfy the deﬁnition of physical realizability
given in Deﬁnition 1.

Corresponding to the plant (52) and (53), we form the
closed loop quantum system by identifying the output of the
plant dy with the input to the controller dy, and identifying
the output of the controller du with the input to the plant
du. This leads to the following closed-loop QSDEs:

where

For a given quantum plant of the form (52), the coherent
quantum H ∞ control problem involves ﬁnding a physically
realizable quantum controller (53) such that the resulting
closed loop system (54) is such that the following conditions
are satisﬁed:

Remark 3: In the paper [11], a version of the coherent
quantum H ∞ control problem is solved for linear quantum
systems described by real QSDEs which are similar to
those in (26). In this case, the problem is solved using a
standard two Riccati equation approach such as given in
[54], [55]. A result is given in [11] which shows that any
H ∞ controller which is synthesized using the two Riccati
equation approach can be made physically realizable by
adding suitable additional quantum noises.

B. Coherent H ∞ control of annihilator operator quantum
linear systems

In this subsection, we consider the special case of coherent
quantum H ∞ control for annihilation operator quantum
linear systems of the form considered in Subsection II-B
and present the Riccati equation solution to this problem
obtained in [14], [15]. The quantum H ∞ control problem
being considered is the same as considered in Subsection
IV-A but we restrict attention to annihilation operator plants
of the form (19) as follows:

dz (t) = H1˜a(t)dt + K12du (t) ;

d˜a(t) = F ˜a(t)dt +(cid:2) G0 G1 G2 (cid:3)

Also, we restrict attention to annihilation operator controllers

The following Theorem is presented in [14], [15].
Theorem 8: Necessity: Consider a quantum plant (57)
satisfying the above assumptions. If there exists a quantum
controller of the form (58) such that the resulting closed-loop
system satisﬁes the conditions (55), (56), then the Riccati
equations (59) and (60) will have stabilizing solutions X ≥ 0
and Y ≥ 0 satisfying (61).
Sufﬁciency: Suppose the Riccati equations (59) and (60) have
stabilizing solutions X ≥ 0 and Y ≥ 0 satisfying (61). If
the controller (58) is such that the matrices Fc, Gc, Hc are
as deﬁned in (62), then the resulting closed-loop system will
satisfy the conditions (55), (56).

Note that this theorem does not guarantee that a controller
deﬁned by (58), (62) will be physically realizable. However,
if the matrices deﬁned in (62) are such that
kHc (sI − Fc)−1 Gck < 1,

then it follows from Theorem 7 that a corresponding phys-
ically realizable controller of the form (58) can be con-
structed.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have surveyed some recent results in
the area of quantum linear systems theory and the related
area of coherent quantum H ∞ control. However, a number
of other recent results on aspects of quantum linear systems
theory have not been covered in this paper. These include
results on coherent quantum LQG control (see [11], [38]),
and model reduction for quantum linear systems (see [51]).
Furthermore, in order to apply synthesis results on coherent
quantum feedback controller synthesis, it is necessary to
realize a synthesized feedback controller transfer function
using physical optical components such as optical cavities,
beam-splitters, optical ampliﬁers, and phase shifters. In a
recent paper [22], this issue was addressed for a general
class of coherent linear quantum controllers. An alternative
approach to this problem is addressed in [19] for the class of
annihilation operator linear quantum systems considered in
Subsection II-B and [14]–[16]. For this class of quantum sys-
tems, an algorithm is given to realize a physically realizable
controller transfer function in terms of a cascade connection
of optical cavities and phase shifters.

An important application of both classical and coherent
feedback control of quantum systems is in enhancing the
property of entanglement for linear quantum systems. Entan-
glement is an intrinsically quantum mechanical notion which
has many applications in the area of quantum computing and
quantum communications.

To conclude, we have surveyed some of the important
advances in the area of linear quantum control
theory.
However, many important problems in this area remain open
and the area provides a great scope for future research.
