ABSTRACT

The calculation of line widths constitutes a theoretical as well as a computational challenge in the
calculation of opacities of hot dense plasmas. Opacity models use line broadening approximations
that are untested at stellar interior conditions. Moreover, calculations of atomic spectra nearby the
convection zone boundary (CZB) of the sun, indicate a large discrepancy in the K-shell line widths
between several atomic codes and the Opacity-Project. In this work, the atomic code STAR is used
to study the sensitivity of solar opacities to line-broadening. Atomic spectra of several elements
are analyzed and compared within the solar interior. Variations in the solar opacity proﬁle due to
changes in the Stark widths are shown to be signiﬁcant and to result mainly due to K-shell lines.
In light of the solar opacity problem, the results are compared with the required opacity variations
of the present day sun, as imposed by helioseismic and neutrino observations. It is shown that an
increase of the line widths results in a smooth increase of the solar opacity proﬁle, ranging from ≈ 15%
nearby the CZB to about 2% at the solar core. This systematic variation is much larger than the
discrepancy between diﬀerent atomic codes and signiﬁcantly reduces the missing opacity nearby the
CZB, required by observable constraints of present day sun. It also highlights the need for a better
theoretical characterization of the line broadening phenomena at stellar interior conditions and of the
uncertainty due to the way it is implemented by state of the art atomic codes.

1. INTRODUCTION

The revision of the solar photospheric abundances over
the past decade (Asplund et al. (2005, 2009); Caﬀau
et al. (2011); Scott, Pat et al. (2015a,b); Grevesse, Nico-
las et al. (2015)), gave rise to a new problem in solar
physics. The indicated solar metallicity, which is mainly
due to low-Z metallic elements, has been signiﬁcantly
revised downward than previously assumed (Grevesse &
Noels (1993); Grevesse & Sauval (1998)). Using these re-
vised abundances, standard solar models (SSMs), which
are the fundamental theoretical tools to investigate the
properties of the solar interior, are in conﬂict with he-
lioseismic measurements (Basu & Antia (2004)), such as
the radius of the convection-zone boundary (CZB), the
surface helium abundance and the sound speed proﬁle
(Serenelli et al. (2009)). The resulting solar composition
problem, has triggered a rapid increase of research eﬀorts
in the ﬁeld.

The radiative opacity of the solar mixture is a key
quantity describing the coupling between radiation and
matter in the hot and dense solar interior. Absorption by
photoexcitation and photoionization can become a major
source of opacity for the partially ionized metals, which
contribute signiﬁcantly to the opacity, although they are
only present as a few percent of the mixture. As a re-
sult, the opacity proﬁle of the sun depends strongly on
the metallic abundances, and there exists a direct rela-
tion between the solar composition problem and the role
of metallic opacity in solar models. Several explanations
to the solar composition problem were proposed (see
Bergemann & Serenelli (2014) and references therein).
One popular explanation suggests that the solar opac-

menahem.krief@mail.huji.ac.il

ity proﬁle must be revised. Indeed, it has been shown
(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2009)) that in order to re-
produce the helioseismic measurements, changes in the
solar opacity proﬁle are required to compensate the re-
vised lower solar metallicity. It is believed that the opac-
ities of metals in the stellar mixture should be revised
upward to compensate for the decreased low-Z metal-
lic element abundances. The eﬀect of intrinsic opacity
changes (that is, opacity changes with a ﬁxed composi-
tion) on observable quantities, i.e. the convection bound-
ary radius, surface helium abundance, sound speed pro-
ﬁle and neutrino ﬂuxes, can be studied by the linear solar
model (LSM) of Villante & Ricci (2010). It was shown
(Serenelli et al. (2009); Villante (2010); Villante & Ricci
(2010); Villante et al. (2014)), that a smooth increase
of the opacity from the range of 5% − 10% in the cen-
tral regions to the range of 20% − 30% near the CZB is
required reproduce the helioseismic and neutrino ﬂuxes
observations.

Over the past decades, detailed calculations of solar
opacities were performed by several groups with state of
the art atomic codes, such as the Opacity-Project (OP)
(Seaton et al. (1994); Badnell et al. (2005); Delahaye
et al. (2016)), OPAL (Rogers & Iglesias (1992); Iglesias
& Rogers (1996); Iglesias (2015)), ATOMIC (Neuforge-
Verheecke et al. (2001); Colgan et al. (2013, 2016)) and
OPAS (Blancard et al. (2012); Mondet et al. (2015);
Le Pennec et al. (2015)). We have recently used our opac-
ity code STAR, which implements the Super-Transition-
Array (STA) method (Bar-Shalom et al. (1989)), for a de-
tailed calculation of the solar opacity (Krief et al. (2016)).
The calculation of spectral line shapes constitutes a
theoretical as well as a computational challenge in the
calculation of atomic spectra. The broadening of spec-

2

Krief et al.

tral lines in hot dense plasmas is due to radiation damp-
ing, thermal Doppler eﬀects, and pressure (Stark) broad-
ening. The latter stems from complex interactions of
the emitting ions with the plasma environment. These
complex interactions are not taken into account in the
atomic calculation (i.e. oscillator strength, transition
energies, etc.), and aﬀect the spectral opacity mainly
through the line-shapes. It is well known that even state
of the art computer-simulation Stark width models dis-
agree by at least a factor of 2 (Stambulchik (2013); Alex-
iou et al. (2014)). There is also a disagreement between
advanced convergent-close-coupling quantum mechanical
line-width calculations and experiments, even for simple
Li and Be-like ions for Z ≤ 10.
It appears that this
disagreement increases with the atomic number Z, and,
as was shown by Ralchenko et al. (2003), the experi-
mental line widths are always larger than the quantum-
mechanical ones, suggesting some additional line broad-
ening mechanism for higher-Z. In any case, the exper-
imental data is only available for much lower tempera-
tures and densities than those found in the solar inte-
rior.
In addition, line-wing models, which may have a
major eﬀect on Rosseland opacities, are untested exper-
imentally. Excited spectator electrons also pose com-
putational complications (Iglesias (2010, 2015)) and the
eﬀect of autoionizing states is still not well understood
(Nahar et al. (2011)). Moreover, since calculations of
spectral opacities for mid and high Z elements typically
include a huge number of spectral lines, simpliﬁed line-
proﬁles and approximate line widths are used in opacity
codes, in order to reduce the large computational com-
plexity. More speciﬁcally, opacity codes often use Voigt
(or modiﬁed Voigt Iglesias et al. (2009)) proﬁles, while
empirical formulae, which provide ﬁts to available experi-
mental data (Dimitrijevic & Konjevic (1987)) or ab-initio
calculations (Seaton (1987)), are used in the calculation
of line widths, based on a theory originally proposed by
Griem (1968). For one, two, and three electron ions, sev-
eral codes use an approximate linear Stark model by Lee
(1988) (see also Iglesias (2016)) for the calculation of the
line proﬁle.

Hence, all opacity models use line broadening approx-
imations that are untested at stellar interior conditions.
Sensitivity studies of solar opacities with respect to the
line widths were performed in the past by Rogers & Igle-
sias (1992) and also mentioned by Seaton et al. (1994);
Fontes et al. (2015); Mondet et al. (2015); Iglesias (2015).
In this work, we use the atomic code STAR to analyze
the sensitivity of solar opacities to Stark widths. We use
a SSM calibrated with the recent AGSS09 photospheric
abundances. We show that variations in the solar opac-
ity proﬁle due to changes in the Stark widths are mainly
due to the K-shell lines. We compare our results with the
constraints on the opacity proﬁle of the present day sun,
as imposed in the framework of the linear solar model.

2. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS

The atomic code STAR (Krief & Feigel (2015a); Krief
et al. (2016)) is used to examine the sensitivity of the so-
lar opacity proﬁle, to the values of the Stark widths. Pho-
toexcitation and photoionization atomic calculations are
based on a fully relativistic quantum mechanical theory
via the Dirac equation. The inverse bremsstrahlung is
calculated via a screened hydrogenic approximation with

a degeneracy correction and the Thomson scattering in-
cludes corrections for (relativistic) degeneracy, collective
and ﬁnite-temperature relativistic eﬀects. The calcula-
tions are carried along a thermodynamic path obtained
from a solar model implemented by Villante et al. (2014)
(and references therein, see also Krief et al. (2016)). This
solar model is calibrated with the recent AGSS09 set of
chemical abundances (Asplund et al. (2009)). We note
that even though the opacity used in this solar model
was calculated with the OP atomic code (Seaton et al.
(1994); Badnell et al. (2005)), calculation of opacities
with diﬀerent opacity models on the same thermody-
namic path is justiﬁed in the framework of the linear-
solar-model and yields the intrinsic opacity changes of
the nominal solar model (Villante & Ricci (2010)). The
solar mixture in the solar model consists of 24 elements.
The individual contributions to the Rosseland opacity
along 0 ≤ R ≤ 0.8R(cid:12), due to individual elements in the
mixture and due to all metallic elements combined, are
given in Figure 1.
It is seen that the most contribut-
ing metallic elements are iron and oxygen, while other
dominant elements (with a contribution larger than 10%
over some range in solar interior) are silicon, neon, mag-
nesium and sulfur. As mentioned in the introduction,
it is evident that metals have a major opacity fraction
throughout the solar interior, rising from about 40%, at
the core to about 90% near the CZB. The metallic opac-
ity at the core is mainly due to photoexcitation and pho-
tionization of the iron K-shell, while near the CZB it is
mainly due to photoexcitation and photionization of the
oxygen, neon and magnesium K-shell and of the iron M
and L shells (Blancard et al. (2012); Colgan et al. (2013,
2016); Krief et al. (2016)).

In the STAR code, Voigt proﬁles are used to de-
scribe the spectral envelopes of the super-transition-
arrays. The Gaussian width results from Doppler broad-
ening and from a statistical broadening due to the huge
number of lines in each array. This statistical width is
due to the ﬂuctuations in the occupation numbers of the
various conﬁgurations in each superconﬁguration, and
due to the unresolved-transition-array (UTA) widths of
the various conﬁgurations (Moszkowski (1962); Bauche-
Arnoult et al. (1985); Bar-Shalom et al. (1995); Krief &
Feigel (2015b)). The Lorentzian width contains natural
broadening and electron impact (Stark) broadening via
the widely used semi empirical formulas by Dimitrijevic
& Konjevic (1987).

Opacity calculations by several groups (Iglesias &
Rogers (1995); Colgan et al. (2013, 2016); Blancard et al.
(2012); Krief et al. (2016)), have indicated much smaller
K-shell line widths than obtained by the OP (Badnell
et al. (2005)), speciﬁcally for oxygen and magnesium near
the CZB (T = 192.9eV , ne = 1023cm−3). On the other
hand, the OP opacity of iron in the spectral region of
the M-shell is signiﬁcantly lower due to a lower OP pop-
ulation of ionic states with at least one electron in the
M-shell (Blancard et al. (2012)). These diﬀerences have a
major eﬀect on the Rosseland opacities of the individual
elements, but a rather small eﬀect on the total solar mix-
ture opacity. In Figure 2 STAR and OP spectral opaci-
ties are given for oxygen, neon, magnesium and iron at
T = 192.9eV , ne = 1023cm−3 (nearby the CZB); for sil-
icon and iron at T = 684.5eV , ne = 1024cm−3 (found at

opacity of STAR is much higher, as explained above. In
conclusion, there is a large discrepancy in the K-shell line
widths between OP and STAR (as well as other atomic
codes), which is mainly due to diﬀerences in the Stark
widths.

In order to estimate the sensitivity of the opacity of
elements in the solar mixture to line broadening, we
have performed solar opacity calculations with the Stark
widths of all
lines multiplied by factors arbitrary of
2, 5, 10 and 15. The calculation was also performed with
a multiplication of K-shell lines widths only. In addition,
we have performed a calculation with zero Lorentzian
widths (that is, with Gaussian line shapes) and a cal-
culation without the UTA widths, which is the part of
the total Gaussian width that is due to the individual
widths of the various UTAs in each STA. The relative
diﬀerences between these calculations and the nominal
STAR calculation are shown in Figure 3. It is seen that
indeed, the Lorentzian line broadening has a major ef-
fect on the opacity of the individual elements. We note
that maxima which appear in the sensitivities are due to
spectral lines and photoionization edges that cross the
Rosseland peak (located at ≈ 3.8kBT ), as the tempera-
ture changes throughout the solar interior. This also ex-
plains why these maxima occur at a larger radii for lower
Z elements: since the line energies are lower for lighter
elements, the contribution of the lines is higher at lower
temperatures - which occur at larger radii. For Stark
widths multiplied by 2 and 5 (Figs. 3a-3b), it is seen
that the opacity changes mainly due to the broadening
of the K-shell lines, for the lighter elements with Z (cid:46) 15.
For the heavier elements, in the range R (cid:46) 0.25R(cid:12) the
opacity changes mainly due to broadening of the K-shell
lines, while for R (cid:38) 0.5R(cid:12) the L and M-shell line widths
aﬀect the opacity. For larger multiplication of the Stark
widths (by factors of 10 and 15, shown in Figs. 3c-3d),
there is a signiﬁcant contribution to the opacity due to
non K-shell lines, for elements with Z (cid:46) 15, explained by
the large wings of the Voigt proﬁles of such lines which
increases the background opacity (which is due to inverse
photoabsorption, bremsstrahlung and scattering), at the
vicinity of the Rosseland peak. It is seen from Figure 3e
that the nominal Lorentz widths also have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the elemental opacities. Finally, Figure 3f shows
that the UTA widths have a small eﬀect ((cid:46) 3%), which
means that the Gaussian widths are dominated by the
variance of the transition energies of the UTAs within
super-transition arrays, and not by the individual widths
of the UTAs. We note that in general, the heavier ele-
ments are less sensitive to line broadening, since their
spectra is composed of a larger number of overlapping
lines, so that the widths of individual lines are less im-
portant than the statistical widths due to the diﬀerent
energies of the various overlapping lines.

Villante et al. (2014) have calculated the range of the
variation in the opacity proﬁle, required for helioseis-
mic and neutrino observations to agree with standard
solar models, calibrated with the recent AGSS09 abun-
dances. The range of the required opacity variation is
shown in Figure 4, in the form of a band. It is impor-
tant to note that in order to reconcile the observed and
predicted sound speed proﬁle and convection boundary
radius, variations in the opacity must only have a shape
lying within the variation band. The magnitude of the

R ≈ 0.25R(cid:12)) and for iron and nickel at T = 1365.76eV ,
ne = 1026cm−3 (nearby the solar core). STAR spectra
with the K-shell Stark line-widths multiplied by arbitrary
factors of 5, 10 and 15 are also shown. The diﬀerences
described above between the spectra at the CZB, are ev-
ident from the ﬁgure.
It appears that the discrepancy
in the K-shell widths increases with the atomic number.
For example, nearby the CZB, the discrepancy is about a
factor of 5 for oxygen, about a factor of 10 for neon and
a factor larger than 15 for magnesium. Large discrep-
ancies in the K-shell widths appear also for silicon and
iron at R ≈ 0.25R(cid:12) and for iron and nickel nearby the
solar core, for which there is also a large discrepancy in
M-shell photoionization spectra. On the other hand, for
iron nearby the CZB, the K-shell lines do not contribute
to the opacity and there is a relatively good agreement in
the L and M-shell line widths, although the the L-Shell

opacity variation is required to reconcile the observed
neutrino ﬂuxes and surface helium abundance. The rela-
tive diﬀerences between OP to OPAL, OPAS and STAR,
which are much smaller than the required variation, are
also shown in Figure 4. Relative diﬀerences between a
nominal STAR calculation and STAR calculations with
altered line widths are shown in Figure 5. It is evident
that the sensitivity to the values of the line widths is
larger nearby the CZB than near the central regions, and
that it results mainly due to the K-shell lines. This is
understood from the fact that nearby the CZB, abun-
dant metals (oxygen, neon, magnesium) have their K-
shell lines nearby the Rosseland peak, while heavier ele-
ments such as iron have their L-shell lines, which are less
sensitive to line-broadening, at the vicinity of the Rosse-
land peak. On the other hand, in the central regions,
few heavy metals (such as iron and nickel) have their
K-shell not pressured ionized and nearby the Rosseland
peak. As expected, it is seen from Figure 5 that the UTA
widths have a very small eﬀect ((cid:46) 2%) throughout the
solar radiative zone.

3. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

Diﬀerent calculations of solar opacities by various
groups (i.e. OP, OPAL, OPAS, ATOMIC and STAR)
show a discrepancy of (cid:46) 5%, which is much smaller
than the variations required to bring back the agreement
between helioseismology and SSMs calibrated with the
updated low-Z solar composition. However, an element
by element comparison with OP shows large diﬀerences
(≈ ±40%) nearby the CZB. On the other hand, compar-
isons between atomic codes other than OP show a good
agreement (≈few%), which indicates that these atomic
codes use similar approximations for the inﬂuence of the
plasma environment on the emitting ions (such as line
broadening), which may diﬀer than the approximations
implemented by OP. It must also be stressed that the
small discrepancy in the solar mixture opacity between
diﬀerent atomic calculations is by no means a measure of
the accuracy of these calculations, since similar physical
models and approximations are used.

Opacity calculations at stellar interior conditions have
never been validated experimentally. A recent work on
experimental opacities indicates that theoretical opacity
calculations, which are the only available source of radia-
tive opacities in solar models, might in fact be systemati-
cally wrong. Opacity spectra of iron have been measured
by Bailey et al. (2015), for the ﬁrst time, at conditions
that closely resemble those at the CZB. The measured
Rosseland mean is larger by ≈ 60% than all predicted
values by available atomic calculations. No satisfactory
explanation to this discrepancy is yet known.

In this work, line-broadening, which results from the
extremely complex interaction of the plasma environ-
ment with the emitting ions, was pointed out as a source
of uncertainty in the calculation of solar opacities. First,
as was shown in several recent works (Blancard et al.
(2012); Colgan et al. (2016); Krief et al. (2016)), it was
stressed that K-shell line widths given by OP are much
larger than obtained from other calculations of spectral
opacities of metals within the solar interior. The dif-
ferences in the widths, which were shown to increase
with the atomic number, range from a factor of ≈ 5 to
a factor larger than 15. Rosseland opacities were cal-

culated by STAR for a solar model calibrated with the
recent AGSS09 photospheric abundances and the sensi-
tivity of the elemental opacities of various elements to
line-broadening was studied throughout the solar inte-
rior. Line-widths are shown to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the solar opacity proﬁle, which is shown to result mainly
from K-shell lines. The variations in the opacity proﬁle
due to line broadening were found to mimic the behavior
of the required opacity variation proﬁle of the present
day sun, as imposed by helioseismic and neutrino obser-
vations via the framework of the linear solar model. This
signiﬁes the need for a better theoretical characterization
of the uncertainties in the modeling and implementation
of the line broadening phenomena by state of the art
atomic codes. Although the missing opacity nearby the
CZB is reduced signiﬁcantly due to line broadening, it is
still large in the internal regions where the line broaden-
ing eﬀect is less than 5% (see Figure 5). Due to the higher
densities prevailing in these inner regions, other sources
of uncertainty in opacity calculations may be the diﬀer-
ent modeling of the plasma environment, which give rise
to large diﬀerences in the ionic states distribution (Igle-
sias & Rogers (1995); Blancard et al. (2012); Colgan et al.
(2016); Krief et al. (2016)), diﬀerent boundary conditions
in the framework of ion-sphere models, and corrections
such as ion-ion correlations (Rozsnyai (1991)). We also
note that the diﬀerences between the recently measured
and calculated iron spectra seem to be more complicated
than a trivial diﬀerence in the line widths.

Figure 2. OP and STAR opacity spectra for oxygen, neon, magnesium and iron at T = 192.9eV , ne = 1023cm−3 (found nearby the CZB);
for silicon and iron at T = 684.5eV , ne = 1024cm−3 (found at R ≈ 0.25R(cid:12)) and for iron and nickel at T = 1365.76eV , ne = 1026cm−3
(found nearby the solar core). STAR spectra with the K-shell Stark line-widths multiplied by a factor of 5, 10 and 15 are also shown (except
for iron at T = 192.9eV , ne = 1023cm−3 for which the K-shell lines do not exist in the spectral range of interest).

Figure 3. Relative diﬀerences in the opacity of various elements, between STAR calculations with altered line widths, and the nominal
STAR calculation. In sub-ﬁgures (a)-(d), the Stark line widths were multiplied by 2, 5, 10 and 15, respectively, for all lines (solid curves)
and for K-shell lines only (dashed curves). Calculations with zero Lorentzian widths, and without UTA widths are given in sub-ﬁgures
(e),(f), respectively. The calculations are made for 0 ≤ R ≤ 0.8R(cid:12) across the solar interior.
