A Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem

for noncommutative Hardy spaces associated

with semiﬁnite von Neumann algebras

Lauren Sager

Abstract. In 2008, Blecher and Labuschagne extended Beurling’s classical theorem to H ∞-
invariant subspaces of Lp(M, τ ) for a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra M with a ﬁnite, faithful,
In this paper, using Arveson’s non-commutative
normal tracial state τ when 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.
Hardy space H ∞ in relation to a von Neumann algebra M with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal
tracial weight τ , we prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem for H ∞-invariant spaces of
Lp(M, τ ) when 0 < p ≤ ∞. The proof of the main result relies on proofs of density theorems for
Lp(M, τ ) and semiﬁnite versions of several other known theorems from the ﬁnite case. Using the
main result, we are able to completely characterize all H ∞-invariant subspaces of Lp(M⋊αZ, τ ),
where M⋊α Z is a crossed product of a semiﬁnite von Neumann algebra M by the integer group
Z and H ∞ is a non-selfadjoint crossed product of M by Z+ . As an example, we characterize
all H ∞-invariant subspaces of the Schatten p-class S p(H), where H ∞ is the lower triangular
subalgebra of B(H), for each 0 < p ≤ ∞.

1. Introduction

Let H be an inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert space with an orthonormal base {em}m∈Z,
and B(H) be the set of all bounded linear operators on H. Let τ = T r be the usual trace on
B(H), i.e.

τ (x) =Xi∈Z

hxem, emi,

for all positive x in B(H).

For each 0 < p < ∞, the Schatten p-class Sp(H) consists all these elements x in B(H) such that
τ (|x|p) < ∞. It is well-known that Sp(H) is a complete metric space (a Banach space when
p ≥ 1 and a Hilbert space when p = 2). Moreover, Sp(H) is a two sided ideal of B(H).

Let

A = {x ∈ B(H) : hxem, eni = 0, ∀n < m}

be the lower triangular subalgebra of B(H). In the paper, we are interested in answering the
following question, which is implicitly asked by McAsey, Muhly and Saito in Example 2.6 of
[25].

Problem 1.1. Given a closed subspace K of the Schatten p-class Sp(H) where 0 < p < ∞,

such that K satisﬁes AK ⊆ K, how can we characterize the subspace K?

k·k2

The answer to Problem 1.1 is closely related to our generalization of the classical Beurling
theorem for a Hardy space. Recall the classical Beurling theorem for invariant subspaces as
follows. Let T be the unit circle, and let µ be the measure on T such that dµ = 1
2π dθ. Let
L∞(T, µ) be the commutative von Neumann algebra on T, and deﬁne L2(T, µ) to be the closure
of L∞(T, µ) under the k·k2. Then L2(T, τ ) is a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis {zn : n ∈ Z}.
⊆ L2((T, µ) and H ∞ = H 2 ∩ L∞(T, µ). If we deﬁne Mψ(f ) = ψf
Let H 2 = span{zn : n ≥ 0}
for every f ∈ L2(T, µ), it is easy to show that L∞(T, µ) has a representation onto B(L2(T, µ))
by the map ψ → Mψ. Therefore, L∞(T, µ) and H ∞ can be assumed to act naturally on L2(T, µ)
by multiplication on the left (or right). The classical Beurling’s theorem, proven in 1949 by
A. Beurling in [6], states the following: If W is a nonzero closed, H ∞-invariant subspace (or,
equivalently, zW ⊆ W for every z ∈ H ∞) of H 2, then W = ψH 2 for some ψ ∈ H ∞ with |ψ| = 1
a.e.(µ).
Then we deﬁne Lp(T, τ ) to be the closure of L∞(T, τ ) under k·kp, and H p = {f ∈ Lp(T, µ) :
RT f (eiθ)einθdµ(θ) = 0 for n ∈ N} for 1 ≤ p < ∞. Beurling’s theorem has been extended for
H ∞-invariant subspaces in Hardy spaces H p for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. (See, for example, [8], [15], [16],
[17], [18], [35], and others). The classical Beurling’s theorem has been extended in many other
ways as well.

One such extension comes from the work of D. Blecher and L. Labuschagne in [7]. We
recall the construction of Lp(M, τ ). Let M be a semiﬁnite von Neumann algebra, and let τ
be a faithful, normal tracial weight on M (when τ (I) < ∞, M is ﬁnite). Let I be the set of
elementary operators in M (when M is ﬁnite, I = M). Then deﬁne a mapping from I to
[0,∞) by kxkp = (τ (|x|p))1/p for every x ∈ I, and where |x| = √x∗x. It is nontrivial to prove
that when 1 ≤ p < ∞, k · kp deﬁnes a norm on I, which we call the p-norm. We may then
k·kp. We let L∞(M, τ ) = M, and this space acts naturally on Lp(M, τ ) by
deﬁne Lp(M, τ ) = I
left (or right) multiplication.
We then recall the deﬁnition of Arveson’s non-commutative Hardy space from [1]. If M
is a von Neumann algebra, with faithful, normal tracial weight τ , let A ⊆ M be a weak*
closed subalgebra. Then let D = A ∩ A∗ be a von Neumann subalgebra of M. Then there
exists Φ : M → D, a faithful, normal, trace-preserving conditional expectation, which can be
extended to Φ : L1(M, τ ) → L1(D, τ ). Then A is called a non-commutative Hardy space if (1)
Φ(xy) = Φ(x)Φ(y) for every x, y ∈ A; (2) A + A∗ is weak* dense in M; (3) τ (Φ(x)) = τ (x) for
every x ∈ M.
Blecher and Labuschagne proved the following theorem for ﬁnite von Neumann algebras in
[7]. Let M be a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra with a faithful, tracial, normal state τ , and H ∞
be a maximal subdiagonal subalgebra of M with D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗. Suppose that K is a closed

H ∞-right-invariant subspace of Lp(M, τ ), for some 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. (For p = ∞ it is assumed that
K is weak* closed.) Then K may be written as a column Lp-sum K = Z ⊕col (⊕col
i uiH p), where
Z is a closed (indeed weak* closed if p = ∞) subspace of Lp(M, τ ) such that Z = [ZH ∞
0 ]p, and
where ui are partial isometries in M ∩ K satisfying certain conditions (For more details, see
[7].)Here ⊕col
0 ]p are of type 1, and type 2 respectively (also see [26] for
deﬁnitions of invariant subspaces of diﬀerent types).

i uiH p and Z = [ZH ∞

Examples of ﬁnite von Neumann algebras include the spaces Mn(C) of all n×n matrices with
complex entries when 1 ≤ n < ∞. However, if H is an inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert
space and we view B(H) as M∞(C), the set of all (bounded) ∞ × ∞ matrices with complex
entries, then B(H) is a semiﬁnite von Neumann algebra, and no longer satisﬁes the hypothesis
of the Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem.
In this paper, we therefore consider a version of Blecher and Labuschagne’s Beurling’s the-
orem for semiﬁnite von Neumann algebras. We seek to characterize H ∞-invariant spaces of
Lp(M, τ ) spaces. Adapting Blecher and Labuschagne’s theorem to the semiﬁnite case, we prove
the following result:

Theorem 4.6. Let 1 ≤ p < ∞. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal,
semiﬁnite tracial weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M (see Deﬁnition
2.7). Let D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗. Assume that K is a closed subspace of Lp(M, τ ) such that
H ∞K ⊆ K.
Then there exist a closed subspace Y of Lp(M, τ ) and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial isometries
in M such that:
(i) uλY ∗ = 0 for all λ ∈ Λ.
(ii) uλu∗

Here ⊕row is the row sum of subspaces deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.15.

However, many of the methods used by Blecher and Labuschagne do not apply directly when
M is a semiﬁnite von Neumann algebra. Thus, we prove a density theorem for semiﬁnite von
Neumann algebras through a series of lemmas and propositions.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal, semiﬁnite
tracial weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M. Let 1 ≤ p < ∞. Assume
that K is a closed subspace in Lp(M, τ ) such that H ∞K ⊆ K. Then the following statements
are true.

Subsequently, we are able to prove a noncommutative Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theo-

theorem (see Proposition 5.1, Proposition 5.2).

Here, we use similar methods to our proof for 1 ≤ p < ∞, including proving a similar density
Using theorems 4.6 and 5.4 and corollary 5.5, we are then able to prove a Beurling-Blecher-
Labuschagne-like theorem for the crossed product of a semiﬁnite von Neumann algebra M by
a trace-preserving action α when 0 < p < ∞. We are actually able to fully characterize the
H ∞-invariant subspace of the crossed product.

Theorem 6.3. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial
weight τ , and α be a trace-preserving ∗-automorphism of M. Denote by M ⋊α Z the crossed
product of M by an action α, and still denote by τ a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, extended tracial
weight on M ⋊α Z.
Let H ∞, a weak ∗-closed nonself-adjoint subalgebra generated by {Λ(n)Ψ(x) : x ∈ M, n ≥ 0}
in M ⋊α Z, be a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra of M ⋊α Z. Then the following statements
are true.
(i) Let 0 < p < ∞. Assume that K is a closed subspace of Lp(M ⋊α Z, τ ) such that
H ∞K ⊆ K. Then there exist a projection q in M and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial

In [25], McAsey, Muhly and Saito prove a Beurling’s theorem for a crossed product. Suppose
M is a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra with ﬁnite trace τ and α, a trace preserving automorphism
of M, such that α ﬁxes each element of the center Z(M) of M. Then let A = M ⋊α Z+. Then
every A and A∗-invariant subspace K of L2(M, τ ) has the form K = vH 2 for a partial isometry
v in the commutant of right multiplication by M on L2(M, τ ). This follows from theorem 6.3
when τ is ﬁnite, and p = 2.
McAsey, Muhly and Saito’s result is a corollary of a result by Nazaki and Watatani in [26].
Suppose M is a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra with trace τ , D ⊆ M and a faithful, normal,
trace-preserving conditional expectation Φ : M → D. We let H ∞ be a maximal subdiagonal
algebra with respect to Φ, and suppose that Z(D) ⊆ Z(M). Then, if we let K be a H ∞-invariant
subspace of L2(M, τ ) such that K is of H ∞-type I (in the sense deﬁned in [26]), there exists a
partial isometry v in the commutant of right multiplcation by M such that K = vH 2. Again,
this follows from our result in the ﬁnite case when p = 2.
Similarly, Saito in [32] proves another Beurling-like theorem for a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra
M. Let a closed K of L2(M, τ ) invariant under M ⋊α Z+ such that there are no subspaces of
K with M ⋊α ZK ⊆ K such that K has the form P∞

isometries with {Vnv∗
We are also able to prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne-like theorem for the Schatten p-
classes for 0 < p < ∞, as described at the beginning of this section, using theorems 4.6, 5.4 and
corollary 5.5.

However, if we have that this projection q in D has the characteristic that Sp(H)q ⊆ H p, then
we can prove corollary 6.6, and therefore fully characterize a H ∞-invariant subspace K ⊆ H p

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we discuss preliminary deﬁnitions and
notations. In section 3, we prove the Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem for Lp(M, τ ) when
p = 2, and extend this theorem in section 4 to the case when 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. We provide several
more preliminaries and further extend the Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne theorem to Lp(M, τ )
for 0 < p < 1 in section 5. Finally, in section 6, we discuss some applications of our results
on invariant subspaces for analytic crossed products and discuss the results for the Schatten
p-class.

2. Preliminaries and Notation

In this section we give some preliminary deﬁnitions and results for non-commutative Lp
spaces for a von Neumann algebra with a tracial weight. We then discuss Arveson’s non-
commutative Hardy space.

2.1. Weak ∗-topology. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a predual M♯. Recall
that the weak ∗-topology σ(M,M♯) on M is a topology on M induced from the predual space
M♯. The following known result (for example, see Theorem 1.7.8 in [30]) is useful.

Lemma 2.1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra. If {eλ}λ∈Λ is a net of projections in M
such that eλ → I in weak ∗-topology, then eλx → x, xeλ → x and eλxeλ → x in weak ∗-topology
for all x in M.

2.2. Semiﬁnite von Neumann Algebras. We begin with a description of a semiﬁnite

von Neumann algebra.

mapping τ : M+ → [0,∞] is a tracial weight on M if

Let M be a von Neumann algebra, and let M+ be the positive part of M. Recall that a
(1) τ (x + y) = τ (x) + τ (y) for x, y ∈ M+
(2) τ (ax) = aτ (x) for x ∈ M+ and a ∈ [0,∞]
(3) τ (xx∗) = τ (x∗x) for every x ∈ M.

A tracial weight τ is called normal if τ : M+ → C is continuous with respect to the weak
∗-topology. τ is faithful if for every a ∈ M+, τ (a∗a) = 0 implies a = 0. τ is said to be ﬁnite
if τ (I) < ∞, and semiﬁnite if for any x ∈ M+, x 6= 0, there is a y ∈ M+, y 6= 0 such that
τ (y) < ∞ and y ≤ x. A von Neumann algebra M is called semiﬁnite if a faithful, normal
semiﬁnite τ exists.

weight τ . Then the following are true.

The following lemma is well known.
Lemma 2.2. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial
(1) There exists a family {ej}j∈J of orthogonal projections in M such that (i) Pj ej con-
(2) There exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in M such that (i) eλ → I in weak ∗-topology

verges to I in weak ∗-topology and (ii) τ (ej) < ∞ for each j ∈ J.
and (ii) τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ.

Proof. It is not hard to see that (2) follows from (1). For the purpose of completeness, we
sketch the proof of (1) here. Actually, we need only to show that every nonzero projection e in
M contains a nonzero subprojection ˜e such that τ (˜e) < ∞. Then the rest follows directly from
Zorn’s lemma.
Let e be a nonzero projection in M. Since τ is semiﬁnite, then is a y ∈ M+, y 6= 0 such that
τ (y) < ∞ and y ≤ f . Therefore, there exist a positive number λ > 0 and a nonzero spectral
projection ˜e of y in M such that λ˜e ≤ y. Hence ˜e is a non-zero subprojection of e such that
τ (˜e) < ∞.

2.3. Lp-spaces of semiﬁnite von Neumann algebras. Let M be a von Neumann alge-

bra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial weight τ . We let

I = span{MeM : e = e∗ = e2 ∈ M with τ (e) < ∞}

be the set of elementary operators in M (see Deﬁnition 3.1 in [33]). Then I is a two-sided ideal
of M.

For each 0 < p < ∞, we deﬁne a mapping k · kp : I → [0,∞) as follows

It is a highly trivial fact that k · kp is a norm on I for 1 ≤ p < ∞, and a p-norm on I for
0 < p < 1. (see Theorem 4.9 in [13])

kxkp = (τ (|x|)p)

for every x ∈ I.

Definition 2.3. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial
weight τ , and I = span{MeM : e = e∗ = e2 ∈ M with τ (e) < ∞} be the set of elementary
operators in M. We deﬁne Lp(M, τ ), for 0 < p < ∞, to be the completion of I under k · kp,
i.e.

Lp(M, τ ) = I

k·kp.

As usual, we let L∞(M, τ ) be M.

The following two lemmas are well known.

Lemma 2.5. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial

weight τ . The following are true.

(1) (H¨older’s Inequality) For 0 < p, q, r ≤ ∞ with 1/p + 1/q = 1/r, we have
for all x ∈ Lp(M, τ ) and y ∈ Lq(M, τ ).

kxykr ≤ kxkpkykq

(2) For each 0 < r ≤ ∞, we have kaxbkr ≤ kakkxkrkbk for x ∈ Lr(M, τ ) and a, b ∈ M.
(3) (Duality) For any 1 ≤ p < ∞ and 1 < q ≤ ∞ with 1/p + 1/q = 1, we have

Therefore, Lr(M, τ ) is an M bi-module for each 0 < r ≤ ∞.

(Lp(M, τ ))♯ = Lq(M, τ )

where the duality between Lp(M, τ ) and Lq(M, τ ) is given by hx, yi = τ (xy). Thus,
L1(M, τ ) is the predual of M.

Proof. See [13].

Lemma 2.6. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, tracial
weight τ and 0 < p < ∞. If {eλ}λ∈Λ is a net of projections in M such that such that eλ → I in
the weak ∗-topology, then for every x ∈ Lp(M, τ )

lim
λ keλx − xkp = 0;

lim
λ kxeλ − xkp = 0;

and

lim
λ keλxeλ − xkp = 0.

Proof. For the purpose of completeness, we include a proof here. Notice that the set I of

elementary operators of M is dense in Lp(M, τ ) (see Deﬁnition 2.3) and

keλxeλ − xkp = keλ(xeλ − x) + eλx − xkp, ∀ x ∈ Lp(M, τ ).

Because of Lemma 2.5, it suﬃces to show that, for all a, b ∈ M and a projection f in M with
τ (f ) < ∞, we have limλ keλ(af b) − af bkp = 0 and limλ k(af b)eλ − af bkp = 0.

limλ keλb∗f a∗ − b∗f a∗kp = 0, for 0 < p < 2.

Assume that 2 ≤ p < ∞. We have

This ends the proof of the lemma.

2.4. Arveson’s Non-Commutative Hardy Space. In this subsection, we will recall
Arveson’s deﬁnition of non-commutative Hardy spaces. Assume that M is a von Neumann
algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal tracial weight τ . Assume A ⊆ M is a weak*-closed
subalgebra of M, and let D = A ∩ A∗. Assume that Φ : M → D is faithful, normal conditional
expectation from M onto D.

(1) The restriction of τ on D = A ∩ A∗ is semiﬁnite.
(2) Φ(xy) = Φ(x)Φ(y) for every x, y ∈ A.
(3) A + A∗ is weak* dense in M.
(4) τ (Φ(x)) = τ (x) for every positive operator x in M.

In this case, A will also be denoted by H ∞. Furthermore, we denote [A ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p by H p for

Remark 2.8. It was shown in [38] and [21] that such a subalgebra H ∞ with respect to (M, Φ)
is maximal among semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebras satisfying (1), (2), (3) and (4). From this
fact, it follows that

H ∞ = {a ∈ M : Φ(xay) = 0, ∀ x ∈ H ∞, y ∈ H ∞ ∩ Ker(Φ)}.

Remark 2.9. Following notation from Deﬁnition 2.7, we know that the conditional expec-
tation Φ : M → D can be extended to a projection from Lp(M, τ ) onto Lp(D, τ ) for each
1 ≤ p < ∞ (see Proposition 2.3 in [38] or [5]). Such extended projection will still be denoted by
Φ. Moreover,

Φ(axb) = aΦ(x)b,

Notation 2.10. We will let H ∞

∀ a, b ∈ D, x ∈ Lp(M, τ ), 1 ≤ p < ∞.
0 = ker(Φ) ∩ H p.

0 = ker(Φ) ∩ H ∞ and H p

The next result follows directly from Deﬁnition 2.7 and can be found in Lemma 3.1 of [5].
Lemma 2.11. If e is a projection in D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗ with 0 < τ (e) < ∞, then eH ∞e is a

ﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra of eMe, and [eH ∞e]p = eH pe.

We will need the following technical lemma in the later sections.

Lemma 2.12. Suppose M is a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal,
tracial weight τ . Let H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra in M in the sense of Deﬁnition
2.7 (namely, the restriction of τ on D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗ is semiﬁnite).
Then for every x ∈ Lp(M, τ ) with 0 < p < ∞ and for every e ∈ D with 0 < τ (e) < ∞, there
exist an h1, h3 ∈ eH ∞e and an h2, h4 ∈ eH pe such that:

(i) h1h2 = e = h2h1 and h3h4 = h4h3 = e
(ii) h1ex and xeh3 are in M.
Proof. Let

ex = √exx∗eu1 = |x∗e|u1

1

be the polar decomposition of ex in Lp(M, τ ), where u1 is a partial isometry in M and |x∗e| is
a positive operator in Lp(M, τ ). It is not hard to see that |x∗e| ∈ eLp(M, τ )e = Lp(eMe, τ ).
Since 0 < τ (e) < ∞, we know that eMe is a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra with a faithful
τ (e) τ . And, from Lemma 2.11, it follows that eH ∞e is a ﬁnite subdigonal
normal tracial state
subalgebra of eMe with [eH ∞e]p = eH pe. Note that |x∗e| ∈ Lp(eMe, τ ) and 0 < τ (e) < ∞.
1
Then w = (e + |x∗e|)−1 is an invertible operator in eMe with w−1 ∈ Lp(eMe,
τ (e)τ ). From
Theorem 3.1 in [3], there exist a unitary v in eMe, an h1 ∈ eH ∞e and an h2 ∈ eH pe such that
(i) h1h2 = e = h2h1, and (iia) w = vh1. Now from (iia) we have (iib) h1|x∗e| = v∗w|x∗e| =
v∗(e + |x∗e|)−1|x∗e| ∈ eMe ⊆ M. Hence, from (iib) and the fact that u1 is a partial isometry
in M, we obtain that (ii) h1ex = h1|x∗e|u1 ∈ M. The proof for the existence of h3 and h4 is
similar. This ends the proof of the lemma.

Lemma 2.13. Suppose M is a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal,
tracial weight τ . Let H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra with respect to (M, Φ), where
Φ is a faithful, normal conditional expectation from M onto D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗.

Then there exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that such that
(i) eλ → I in the weak ∗-topology of M and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ.
(ii) We have, for every x ∈ Lp(M, τ ) with 0 < p < ∞,
and

lim
λ keλx − xkp = 0;

lim
λ kxeλ − xkp = 0;

lim
λ keλxeλ − xkp = 0.

Proof. Since H ∞ is a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra of M, the restriction of τ on D is
semiﬁnite. By Lemma 2.2, there exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that eλ → I in
the weak ∗-topology of D and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ. Thus

lim
λ |τ (eλz − z)| = 0,

∀ z ∈ L1(D, τ ).

For each y ∈ L1(M, τ ), we have

lim
λ |τ (eλy − y)| = lim

λ |τ (Φ(eλy − y))| = lim

λ |τ (eλΦ(y) − Φ(y))| = 0.

i.e.

(i) eλ → I in the weak ∗-topology of M and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ.

From (i) and Lemma 2.6, we induce that

(ii) For every x ∈ Lp(M, τ ),
λ keλx − xkp = 0;
lim

lim
λ kxeλ − xkp = 0;

and

lim
λ keλxeλ − xkp = 0.

This ends the proof of the lemma.

3. Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne Theorem for Semiﬁnite Hardy Spaces, p=2

3.1. Main Result. In this section, we will prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne type

theorem for semiﬁnite non-commutative Hardy spaces.

Theorem 3.1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal, semiﬁnite tracial
weight τ , and H ∞ be a weak∗-closed subalgebra of M. Let D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗ be a von Neumann
subalgebra of M, and Φ : M → D be a faithful normal condition expectation.
Assume that H ∞ is a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra with respect to (M, Φ) (see Deﬁnition
2.7). Let K be a closed subspace of L2(M, τ ) satisfying H ∞K ⊆ K. Then there exist a closed
subspace Y of L2(M, τ ) and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial isometries in M, satisfying

µ = 0 for all λ, µ ∈ Λ with λ 6= µ.

(i) uλY ∗ = 0 for all λ ∈ Λ.
(ii) uλu∗
(iii) Y = [H ∞
0 Y ]2, where H ∞
(iv) K = Y ⊕ (⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ)
The proof of this result uses a similar idea as the one in [7] for ﬁnite von Neumann algebras.
We will modify the argument in [7] to prove preceding result for the case of semiﬁnite von
Neumann algebras. First, we present a series of technical lemmas.

0 = H ∞ ∩ ker(Φ).

λ ∈ D and uλu∗

3.2. Some lemmas. Following the notation above, we let M be a von Neumann algebra
with a faithful, normal, semiﬁnite tracial weight τ and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra
of M. Let D = H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗ be a von Neumann subalgebra of M and Φ : M → D a faithful
normal conditional expectation. From Remark 2.9, we know that Φ can be extended to a positive
contraction from Lp(M, τ ) onto Lp(D, τ ) for each 1 ≤ p < ∞ such that

Φ(axb) = aΦ(x)b,

∀ a, b ∈ D, x ∈ Lp(M, τ ), 1 ≤ p < ∞.

We ﬁnd the following lemma is useful.

Lemma 3.2. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal, semiﬁnite tracial

weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M. If x in L1(M, τ ) satisﬁes

then x = 0.

τ (xz) = 0

for all z ∈ H ∞ + (H ∞)∗,

Proof. Assume that x in L1(M, τ ) satisﬁes

τ (xz) = 0

for all z ∈ H ∞ + (H ∞)∗.

Since H ∞ is a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M, H ∞ + (H ∞)∗ is weak∗-dense in M. From
the fact that x ∈ L1(M, τ ), we get that

for all z ∈ M.
As L1(M, τ ) is the predual space of M, we must have x = 0.

τ (xz) = 0

Lemma 3.3. Let K be a closed subspace of L2(M, τ ) satisfying H ∞K ⊆ K. Let

X = K ⊖ [H ∞

0 K]2 ⊆ K ⊆ L2(M, τ ).

Then the following are true.

(i) XX ∗ ⊆ L1(D, τ ).
(ii) X is a left D-module, i.e. for every d ∈ D and x ∈ X, we have dx ∈ X.
(iii) Let x be an element in X and x = hu be the polar decomposition of x in L2(M, τ ),

where u is a partial isometry in M and h = |x∗| ∈ L2(M, τ ). Then
(a) h ∈ L2(D, τ ) and uu∗ ∈ D;
(b) [Dx]2 = L2(D, τ )u;
(c) [H ∞x]2 = H 2u. In particular, H 2u ⊆ X.
(a) X = ⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ;
(b) uλu∗
(c) uλu∗

(iv) There exists a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial isometries in M such that

λ is a projection in D; and
µ = 0 for all λ, µ ∈ Λ with λ 6= µ.

Proof. (i): It is equivalent to show that for every x, y ∈ X, yx∗ ∈ L1(D, τ ).
Assume that x, y ∈ X ⊆ L2(M, τ ). Thus yx∗ ∈ L1(M, τ ). Recall Φ : L1(M, τ ) → L1(D, τ )

is a positive contraction such that

Φ(d1ad2) = d1Φ(a)d2,

∀ d1, d2 ∈ D and a ∈ L1(M, τ ),

and thus

Φ(da) = dΦ(a),

(3.1)
Thus, to prove that yx∗ ∈ L1(D, τ ), it is enough to show that yx∗ − Φ(yx∗) = 0. By Lemma 3.2
and the fact that yx∗ − Φ(yx∗) ∈ L1(M, τ ), we need only to prove that

∀ d ∈ L1(D, τ ) and a ∈ M.

τ ([yx∗ − Φ(yx∗)]z) = 0

for every z ∈ H ∞ + (H ∞)∗.

We will proceed the proof according to the cases (1) z ∈ H ∞
Case (1): Let z ∈ H ∞

0 . Then

τ ([yx∗ − Φ(yx∗)]z) = τ (yx∗z) − τ (Φ(yx∗)z)

0 , (2) z ∈ D, and (3) z ∈ (H ∞

0 )∗.

= τ (yx∗z) − τ (Φ(Φ(yx∗)z))
= τ (zyx∗) − τ (Φ(yx∗)Φ(z))
= 0

Case (2): Let z ∈ D. Then

τ ([yx∗ − Φ(yx∗)]z) = τ (Φ([yx∗ − Φ(yx∗)]z))
= τ ([Φ(yx∗) − Φ(yx∗)]z)
= 0.

( Φ is trace preserving)

( by equation 3.1)
(as x, y are in X and z is in H ∞
0 )

( Φ is trace preserving)

(as x, y are in X and z is in H ∞
0 )

14

LAUREN SAGER

Case (3): Let z ∈ (H ∞

0 )∗. Then

τ ([(yx∗) − Φ(yx∗)]z) = τ (yx∗z) − τ (Φ(yx∗)z)

= τ (y(z∗x)∗) − τ (Φ(Φ(yx∗)z))
= τ (y(z∗x)∗) − τ (Φ(yx∗)Φ(z))
= 0

( Φ is trace preserving)

( by equation 3.1)
(as x, y are in X and z is in H ∞
0 )

This ends the proof of part (i).

(ii): Let d ∈ D and x ∈ X ⊆ K. Since H ∞K ⊆ K, we have dx ∈ K. Now, for h0 ∈ H ∞

0 and

0 , and x ∈ X = K ⊖ [H ∞

τ (h0k(dx)∗) = τ (h0kx∗d∗) = τ (d∗h0kx∗) = 0,

k ∈ K,
as d∗h0 ∈ H ∞
0 K]2. Thus dx ∈ X and X is a left
D-module.
(iii): Assume x is an element in X. Let x = hu be the polar decomposition of x in L2(M, τ ),
where u is a partial isometry in M and h = |x∗| ∈ L2(M, τ ). From the result in (i), we know
that h is in L2(D, τ ). Therefore uu∗, as the range projection of h, is in D. This shows that (a)
is true.
From (a), it follows that [L2(D, τ )uu∗]2 = L2(D, τ )(uu∗). Observe that uu∗ is the range

0 K]2. Hence dx ⊥ [H ∞

projection of h. Therefore, we have [Dh]2 = L2(D, τ )(uu∗), whence
[Dh]2u = L2(D, τ )(uu∗u) = L2(D, τ )u.

(3.2)

We claim that

[Dx]2 = [Dh]2u.

In fact, let ξ ∈ [Dh]2. There exists a sequence {ξn}n∈N in Dh such that ξn → ξ in || · ||2-norm.
Then we have that ξnu → ξu in || ·||2-norm. From the fact that ξnu ∈ [Dhu]2, we conclude that
ξu ∈ [Dhu]2. Therefore, we have that

[Dh]2u ⊆ [Dhu]2 = [Dx]2.

(3.3)
Now let ξ ∈ [Dhu]2 = [Dx]2. There exists a sequence {dn}n∈N in D such that dnhu → ξ
in || · ||2-norm. Let ηn = dnhuu∗ = dnh ∈ Dh. Then ηn → ξu∗ ∈ [Dh]2 in || · ||2-norm.
Thus ηnu = dnhu → ξu∗u in || · ||2-norm. Combining with the fact that dnhu → ξ, we get
ξ = ((ξu∗)u) ∈ [Dh]2u. Or

[Dhu]2 = [Dx]2 ⊆ [Dh]2u.

(3.4)

From equation (3.3), equation (3.4) and equation (3.2), we conclude that

This ends the proof of part (b). The proof of (c) is similar to (b).

[Dx]2 = [Dh]2u = L2(D, τ )u.

(iv) We may assume that X 6= 0. From the result in (iii) and Zorn’s lemma, we may assume
that there exists a maximal family {uλ}λ∈Λ of nonzero partial isometries in M with respect to
(a1) H 2uλ ⊆ X for each λ ∈ Λ;
(b) uλu∗

λ is a projection in D; and

A BEURLING-BLECHER-LABUSCHAGNE THEOREM FOR SEMIFINITE HARDY SPACES

15

(c) uλu∗

µ = 0 for all λ, µ ∈ Λ with λ 6= µ.

We will show that

(a) X = ⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ.
In fact, from (a1), we know that each H 2uλ ⊆ X. Combining with (c), we conclude that
{H 2uλ}λ∈Λ is a family of orthogonal subspaces of X, whence ⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ is a subspace of X.
Now assume that X ⊖ (⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ) is not equal to 0. Pick a nonzero x in X ⊖ (⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ)
and assume that x = hu is the polar decomposition of x in L2(M, τ ), where u is a nonzero
partial isometry in M and h = |x∗| ∈ L2(M, τ ). It follows from the result proved in (iii) that
H 2u ⊆ X and uu∗ is in D.
By Lemma 2.13, there exists a net {ej}j∈J of projections in D such that such that ej → I
in the weak ∗-topology and τ (ej) < ∞ for each j ∈ J.
Let j ∈ J. Then by the choice of x, we get that H 2uλ and x are orthogonal. So,

τ (dejuλx∗) = 0,

∀ d ∈ D.

From (i), ejuλx∗ is in L1(D, τ ). By Lemma 3.2 we conclude that ejuλx∗ = 0 for each j ∈ J.
As uλx∗ ∈ L2(M, τ ), limj kejuλx∗ − uλx∗k2 = 0 by Lemma 2.6. Thus we have that uλx∗ =
uλu∗h = 0. The fact that the initial projection of u∗ is the range projection of h induces that
uλu∗ = 0. Therefore, u is a nonzero partial isometry in M such that H 2u ⊆ X, uu∗ ∈ D, and
uλu∗ = 0 for each λ ∈ Λ. This contradicts the assumption that the family {uλ}λ∈Λ is maximal
with respect to (a1), (b) and (c). Therefore, X = ⊕λ∈ΛH 2uλ. This concludes the proof of part
(iv).

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.4. Let K be a closed subspace of L2(M, τ ) satisfying H ∞K ⊆ K. Let

X = K ⊖ [H ∞

0 K]2 and Y = K ⊖ [H ∞X]2.

Then the following are true.

0 Y ]2

(i) Y X ∗ = 0, or equivalently XY ∗ = 0.
(ii) Y = [H ∞
Proof. (i) We will show that yx∗ = 0 for every y ∈ Y and x ∈ X.
Note that Y ⊆ K ⊆ L2(M, τ ) and X ⊆ K ⊆ L2(M, τ ). We have that Y X ∗ ⊆ L1(M, τ ).
Assume y ∈ Y and x ∈ X. Then by Lemma 3.2, it suﬃces to show that
for every z ∈ H ∞ + (H ∞)∗.

We will proceed the proof according to the cases (1) z ∈ H ∞
Case (1): Let z ∈ H ∞
τ (yx∗z) = τ (zyx∗) = 0,
since x ∈ X, zy ∈ H ∞
Case (2): Let z ∈ D. Then
as y ∈ Y , z∗x ∈ H ∞X, and Y ⊥ H ∞X.

Case (3): Let z ∈ (H ∞

τ (yx∗z) = τ (y(z∗x)∗) = 0,

as y ∈ Y , and z∗x ∈ H ∞

Therefore, Y X ∗ = 0, which ends the proof of (i).
(ii) From part (i), we know that Y X ∗ = 0, whence H ∞

0 Y ]2 ⊆ Y . Let Z = Y ⊖ [H ∞

0 Y X ∗ = 0. Recall Y = K ⊖ [H ∞X]2.
It follows that [H ∞
0 Y ]2 = 0. To prove (ii), it suﬃces to show that
ZZ ∗ = 0. Because Z ⊆ Y, we have that Z ⊥ [H ∞X]2, whence Z ⊥ [H ∞
0 (Y ⊕ [H ∞X]2)]2. This
implies that Z ⊥ [H ∞
0 K]2. We conclude that Z ⊆ X. Note that
Y X ∗ = 0. Since Z ⊆ X and Z ⊆ Y , we have that ZZ ∗ ⊆ Y X ∗ = 0. This ends the proof of

Assume, to the contrary, that K ∩ M & K ∩ M

∩ Lp(M, τ ). Then there exists an x ∈
∩ Lp(M, τ ) such that x /∈ K ∩ M. Then by the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists
K1 ∩ M
ϕ ∈ Lp(M, τ )# = Lq(M, τ ) (where 1
q = 1) such that ϕ(x) 6= 0 and ϕ(y) = 0 for every
y ∈ K ∩ M. Equivalently, there exists a ξ ∈ Lq(M, τ ) such that τ (xξ) 6= 0 and τ (yξ) = 0 for
every y ∈ K ∩ M.
By Lemma 2.13, there exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that τ (eλ) < ∞ for each
λ ∈ Λ, and limλ τ (eλxξ) = τ (xξ). So, we can always assume that there exists a projection e in D
with 0 < τ (e) < ∞ such that τ (exξ) 6= 0 and τ (eyξ) = 0 for every y ∈ K (as K is H ∞-invariant
and e ∈ D ⊆ H ∞).

Now we claim that ξe ∈ L1(M, τ ), as ||ξe||1 ≤ ||ξ||q||e||p < ∞.
Since x ∈ K1 ∩ M

∩ Lp(M, τ ), we can ﬁnd a net {yi}i∈I in K ∩ M, such that yi → x in

the weak∗-topology. Combining this with the fact that ξe ∈ L1(M, τ ), we have

which contradicts the fact that τ (exξ) 6= 0. This ends the proof of part (i).
(ii) Suppose, to the contrary, that [K ∩ M]p & K. Then there exists an x ∈ K such that
x /∈ [K ∩ M]p. Then, by the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists ϕ ∈ Lp(M, τ )# = Lq(M, τ )
(where 1
q = 1), such that ϕ(x) 6= 0 and ϕ(y) = 0 for every y ∈ [K ∩ M]p. This occurs if and
only if there exists a ξ ∈ Lq(M, τ ) such that τ (xξ) 6= 0 and τ (yξ) = 0 for every y ∈ [K ∩ M]p.
By Lemma 2.13, there exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that τ (eλ) < ∞ for each
λ ∈ Λ, and limλ τ (eλxξ) = τ (xξ). So, we may always assume that there exists a projection e in
D with 0 < τ (e) < ∞ such that

(a) τ (exξ) 6= 0; and
(b) τ (eyξ) = 0 for every y ∈ K ∩ M (as K is H ∞-invariant, and e ∈ D ⊆ H ∞).
Since x ∈ Lp(M, τ ) and e is a projection in D such that τ (e) < ∞, by Lemma 2.12, there
exists a h1 ∈ eH ∞e, and h2 ∈ eH pe such that h1ex ∈ M and h1h2 = h2h1 = e. From the fact
that h2 ∈ eH pe, there exists a sequence {an}n∈N in eH ∞e such that limn→∞ kan − h2kp = 0.
Therefore

n→∞|τ (anh1exξ) − τ (h2h1exξ)|
n→∞kan − h2kpkh1exkkξkq

On the other hand, since an, h1 and e are in H ∞ and h1ex ∈ M, we know that anh1ex ∈ K∩M.
From assumption (b), it follows that τ (anh1exξ) = 0 for all n ≥ 1. Therefore τ (exξ) = 0, which
contradicts the assumption (a) that τ (xξe) 6= 0. This ends the proof of part (ii).

Since K is weak∗-closed, it suﬃces to show that

⊆ K.

[K ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ∩ M ⊆ K.

Assume, to the contrary, that x is an element in [K ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ∩ M, but x /∈ K. Thus, by
the Hahn-Banach theorem, there exists a weak* continuous linear functional ϕ on M such that
ϕ(x) 6= 0 and ϕ(y) = 0 for every y ∈ K. Or, there exists a ξ ∈ L1(M, τ ) such that

(a) τ (xξ) 6= 0; and
(b) τ (yξ) = 0 for every y ∈ K.

By Lemma 2.13, there exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that τ (eλ) < ∞ for each
λ ∈ Λ and limλ τ (eλxξ) = τ (xξ). So we may always assume that there exists a projection e in
D with 0 < τ (e) < ∞ such that

(a1) τ (exξ) 6= 0; and
(b1) τ (eyξ) = 0 for every y ∈ K (as K is H ∞-invariant and e ∈ D ⊆ H ∞).

We claim there exists a z = ze ∈ Me such that

(a2) τ (xz) 6= 0; and
(b2) τ (yz) = 0 for every y ∈ K.

Observe that ξ is in L1(M, τ ), and e is a projection in D such that τ (e) < ∞. From Lemma
2.12, there exist h3 ∈ eH ∞e and h4 ∈ eH 1e such that ξeh3 ∈ eMe and h3h4 = e. Thus there
exists a sequence {kn}n∈N of elements in eH ∞e such that limn→∞ kkn − h4k1 = 0. It follows that
n→∞kxkkξeh3kkh4 − knk1 = 0.
lim
n→∞|τ (exξ) − τ (xξeh3kn)| = lim

n→∞|τ (xξeh3h4) − τ (xξeh3kn)| ≤ lim

Combining this with (a1), we know that there exists an N ∈ N such that τ (xξeh3kN ) 6= 0. Let
z = (ξeh3)kN be in M. Then z = ze ∈ Me satisﬁes

(a2) τ (xz) = τ (xξeh3kN ) 6= 0; and
(b2) τ (yz) = τ (yξeh3kN ) = τ ((eh3kN )yξ) = 0 for every y ∈ K.
Note that x ∈ [K ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ∩M. There exists a sequence {xn}n∈N in K ∩ Lp(M, τ ) such

that limn→∞ kxn − xkp = 0. Thus we have

(4.1)
where q satisﬁes 1/p + 1/q = 1. On the other hand, since {xn}n∈N is in K ∩ Lp(M, τ ), by (b2)
we have

|τ (xz − xnz)| = |τ ((x − xn)ze)| ≤ kxn − xkpkzkkekq → 0,

Combining with inequality (4.1), we have

τ (xnz) = 0,

∀ n ∈ N.

τ (xz) = 0.

This contradicts the assumption in (a2) that τ (xz) 6= 0. Therefore,

[K ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ∩ M

5. Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne Theorem for Semiﬁnite Hardy Spaces, 0 < p < 1

5.1. Dense subspaces.
Proposition 5.1. Suppose 0 < p < 1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful,
normal, semiﬁnite tracial weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M. Assume
that K is a closed subspace in Lp(M, τ ) such that H ∞K ⊆ K. Then the following statements
are true.

(i) K ∩ L2(M, τ ) = [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ).
(ii) K = [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p.
Proof. (i) We need only to show that

[K ∩ L2(M, τ )]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ) ⊆ K ∩ L2(M, τ ).

Let x ∈ [K1 ∩ L2(M, τ )]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ). We will show that x ∈ K. By Lemma 2.13, there
exists a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that such that τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ and
limλ keλx − xkp = 0. To show that x ∈ K, it is enough to prove that eλx ∈ K for each λ ∈ Λ.
As x ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]2, there exists a sequence {xn}n∈N in K1 ∩ L2(M, τ ) such that
limn→∞ kxn → xk2 = 0. Thus, for each λ ∈ Λ and some positive number q with 1
n→∞kxn − xk2keλkq = 0.

lim
n→∞keλxn − eλxkp = lim

n→∞keλ(xn − x)kp ≤ lim

Here, we used the fact that τ (eλ) < ∞ and keλkq < ∞. Since H ∞K ⊆ K and eλ ∈ D, we know
that eλxn ∈ K. This implies that eλx ∈ K for each λ ∈ Λ. Thus x ∈ K, whence

2 + 1

q = 1
p ,

[K ∩ L2(M, τ )]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ) ⊆ K ∩ L2(M, τ ).

(ii) We need only to show that

K ⊆ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p.

Suppose that x ∈ K ⊆ Lp(M, τ ). We will show x ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p. By Lemma 2.13, we can
ﬁnd a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that limλ keλx − xk2 = 0 and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each
λ ∈ Λ. To show that x ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p, it suﬃces to prove that eλx ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p for
each λ ∈ Λ.
Note that x ∈ Lp(M, τ ) and τ (eλ) < ∞. By Lemma 2.12, there exist h1 ∈ eλH ∞eλ and
h2 ∈ eλH peλ such that (a) h1h2 = h2h1 = eλ and (b) h1eλx ∈ M. Since h2 ∈ eλH peλ, there
exists a sequence {kn}n∈N in eλH ∞eλ such that limn→∞ kkn − h2kp = 0. Thus

lim
n→∞kknh1eλx − eλxkp = lim

n→∞k(kn − h2)kpkh1eλxk = 0.
It is not hard to check that knh1eλx ∈ K. Moreover, since each kn ∈ eλH ∞eλ, we have

n→∞k(kn − h2)h1eλxkp ≤ lim

(5.1)

kknh1eλxkp = keλknh1eλxk2 ≤ keλk2kknkkh1eλxk < ∞.

Therefore, knh1eλx is also in L2(M, τ ). It follows that knh1eλx ∈ K ∩ Lp(M, τ ). Combining
with (5.1), we know that eλx ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p for each λ ∈ Λ, whence x ∈ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p.
Thus

K ⊆ [K ∩ L2(M, τ )]p.

A BEURLING-BLECHER-LABUSCHAGNE THEOREM FOR SEMIFINITE HARDY SPACES

25

This ends the proof of the proposition.
Proposition 5.2. Suppose 0 < p < 1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful,
normal, semiﬁnite tracial weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M. Assume
that S is a subspace in Lp(M, τ ) such that H ∞S ⊆ S. Then

(cid:3)

[S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p = [[S]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p.

Proof. We need only to show that

Or, equivalently,

[[S]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ⊆ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p.

[S]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ) ⊆ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p.

Let x ∈ [S]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ). By Lemma 2.13, we can ﬁnd a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such
that limλ keλx − xkp = 0 and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ. To show that x ∈ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p, it
suﬃces to prove that eλx ∈ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p for each λ ∈ Λ.
Note that x ∈ [S]2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ). Then there exists a sequence {xn}n∈N in S such that
limn→∞ kxn − xk2 = 0. Therefore,

keλxn − eλxkp = keλ(xn − x)kp ≤ keλkqkxn − xk2 → 0,

(5.2)
where q is a positive number such that 1
p . Since H ∞S ⊆ S and eλ ∈ D, we know that
eλxn ∈ S. Moreover, keλxnkp ≤ keλkqkxnk2 < ∞, which implies eλxn ∈ Lp(M, τ ). This induces
that eλxn ∈ S ∩ Lp(M, τ ). Combining with (5.2), we have that eλx ∈ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p for each
λ ∈ Λ. Thus x ∈ [S ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p for each λ ∈ Λ. Or,

as n → ∞,

q = 1

(i) [(H 2u) ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p = H pu

Proof. (i) Assume that x ∈ H 2 such that xu ∈ (H 2u)∩ Lp(M, τ ). Then xuu∗ ∈ Lp(M, τ ),
and x(uu∗) is also in H 2, as uu∗ ∈ D. So xuu∗ ∈ H 2 ∩ Lp(M, τ ) ⊆ H p by Proposition 3.2 in [5].
Note that H pu is a closed subspace in Lp(M, τ ). We have

for 0 < p < 1.

for 0 < p < 1;

[(H 2u) ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p ⊆ H pu.

Similarly, we have

Combining with Proposition 5.1, we have

[(H pu) ∩ L2(M, τ )]2 ⊆ H 2u.

H pu = [H pu ∩ L2(M, τ )]p ⊆ [(H 2u) ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p.

Hence [(H 2u) ∩ Lp(M, τ )]p = H pu, for 0 < p < 1.

(ii) Let x ∈ H 2. By Lemma 2.13, we can ﬁnd a net {eλ}λ∈Λ of projections in D such that
limλ keλx − xk2 = 0 and τ (eλ) < ∞ for each λ ∈ Λ. From τ (eλ) < ∞, it is easy to verify that
eλx ∈ Lp(M, τ ) ∩ H 2 ⊆ H p by Proposition 3.2 in [5]. Thus eλxu ∈ (H pu) ∩ L2(M, τ ) for each
λ ∈ Λ, whence xu ∈ [(H pu) ∩ L2(M, τ )]2. Or,

Combining with what we proved in (i), we have

H 2u ⊆ [(H pu) ∩ L2(M, τ )]2.

Now, we can prove a Beurling-Blecher-Labuschagne Theorem for the semiﬁnite case when

0 < p < 1.

Theorem 5.4. Let 0 < p < 1. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal,
semiﬁnite tracial weight τ , and H ∞ be a semiﬁnite subdigonal subalgebra of M. Let D =
H ∞ ∩ (H ∞)∗. Assume that K is a closed subspace of Lp(M, τ ) such that H ∞K ⊆ K.
Then there exist a closed subspace Y of Lp(M, τ ) and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial isometries
in M such that:
(i) uλY ∗ = 0 for all λ ∈ Λ.

H ∞K1 ⊆ K1. By Theorem 4.6, there exist a closed subspace Y1 of L2(M, τ ) and a family

6. Invariant Subspaces for Analytic Crossed Products

6.1. Crossed product of a von Neumann algebra M by an action α. Let M be a von
Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal tracial state τ . Let α be a trace-preserving
∗-automorphism of M (so τ (α(x)) = τ (x), ∀x ∈ M+).
Pm∈Z |f (m)|2 < ∞. We denote by {en}n∈Z the orthonormal basis of l2(Z) determined by

We let l2(Z) be the Hilbert space consisting of complex-valued functions f on Z such that

A BEURLING-BLECHER-LABUSCHAGNE THEOREM FOR SEMIFINITE HARDY SPACES

29

en(m) = δ(n, m). We also denote by λ : Z → B(l2(Z)) the left regular representation of Z on
l2(Z), i.e. each λ(n) is determined by λ(n)(em) = em+n.
Let H = L2(M, τ ) ⊗ l2(Z). Then H can also be written as ⊕m∈ZL2(M, τ ) ⊗ em. Consider

representations Ψ and Λ of M and Z, respectively, on H, deﬁned by

Ψ(x)(ξ ⊗ em) = (α−m(x)ξ) ⊗ em,
Λ(n)(ξ ⊗ em) = ξ ⊗ (λ(n)em),

∀ x ∈ M, ∀ ξ ∈ L2(M, τ ), ∀ m ∈ Z

∀ n, m ∈ Z

It can be veriﬁed that

Λ(n)Ψ(x)Λ(−n) = Ψ(αn(x)),

∀ x ∈ M, ∀ n ∈ Z.

Then the crossed product of M by an action α, denoted by M ⋊α Z, is the von Neumann
algebra generated by Ψ(M) and Λ(Z) in B(H). If no confusion arises, we will identify M with
its image Ψ(M) in M ⋊α Z.
It is well known (for example, see Chapter 13 in [19]) that there exists a faithful, normal
conditional expectation Φ from M ⋊α Z onto M such that

Λ(n)Ψ(xn)! = x0,

Φ  N
Xn=−N
Moreover, there exists a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, extended tracial weight, still denoted by τ ,
on M ⋊α Z satisfying

where xn ∈ M for all − N ≤ n ≤ N.

τ (y) = τ (Φ(y)),

for every positive element y in M ⋊α Z.

Example 6.1. Let M = l∞(Z) be an abelian von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful,

normal tracial weight τ , determined by

τ (f ) = Xm∈Z

f (m),

for every positive element f ∈ l∞(Z).

Let α be an action on l∞(Z), deﬁned by
α(f )(m) = f (m − 1),

for every element f ∈ l∞(Z).

It is not hard to verify (for example see Proposition 8.6.4 in [19]) that l∞(Z) ⋊α Z is a type I∞
factor. Thus l∞(Z) ⋊α Z ≃ B(H) for some separable Hilbert space H.

6.2. Invariant subspace for crossed products. From the construction of crossed prod-

uct, we have the following result immediately (also see Section 3 in [1]).

Lemma 6.2. Let M ⋊α Z+ be a weak ∗-closed non-self-adjoint subalgebra generated by

{Λ(n)Ψ(x) : x ∈ M, n ≥ 0}

in M ⋊α Z. Then the following statements are true:

(i) M ⋊α Z+ is a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra with respect to (M ⋊α Z, Φ). (Such

M ⋊α Z+ is called an analytic crossed product and will be denoted by H ∞.)

{Λ(n)Ψ(x) : x ∈ M, n > 0}

Following the notation in Section 6.1, our next result characterizes invariant subspaces in a

Theorem 6.3. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal tracial
weight τ , and α be a trace-preserving ∗-automorphism of M. Denote by M ⋊α Z the crossed
product of M by an action α, and still denote by τ a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal, extended tracial
weight on M ⋊α Z.
Let H ∞ be a weak ∗-closed non-self-adjoint subalgebra generated by {Λ(n)Ψ(x) : x ∈ M, n ≥
0} in M ⋊α Z, be a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra of M ⋊α Z. Then the following statements
are true.
(i) Let 0 < p < ∞. Assume that K is a closed subspace of Lp(M ⋊α Z, τ ) such that
H ∞K ⊆ K. Then there exist a projection q in M and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial
isometries in M ⋊α Z satisfying
(a) uλq = 0 for all λ ∈ Λ;
(b) uλu∗
λ ∈ M and uλu∗
(c) K = (Lp(M ⋊α Z, τ )q) ⊕row (⊕row
(ii) Assume that K is a weak ∗-closed subspace of M ⋊α Z such that H ∞K ⊆ K. Then
there exist a projection q in M and a family {uλ}λ∈Λ of partial isometries in M ⋊α Z

Proof. (i) From Theorem 4.6 and Theorem 5.4,
K = Y ⊕row (⊕row

where Y is a closed subspace of M ⋊α Z and {uλ}λ∈Λ is a family of partial isometries in M ⋊α Z

(b1) uλu∗
(c1) Y = [H ∞

µ = 0 for all λ, µ ∈ Λ with λ 6= µ;

From (c1) and Lemma 6.2, we have

Y = [H ∞

0 Y ]p = [Λ(1)H ∞Y ]p ⊆ Λ(1)Y.

So, Y is a left M ⋊α Z-invariant subspace of Lp(M ⋊α Z, τ ). From Corollary 5.5, there exists a
projection q in M such that Y = Lp(M ⋊α Z, τ )q. Therefore, we have

6.3. Invariant subspaces for Schatten p-classes. Let H be an inﬁnite dimensional sep-
arable Hilbert space with an orthonormal base {em}m∈Z. Let τ = T r be the usual trace on
B(H), i.e.

τ (x) =Xi∈Z

hxem, emi,

for all positive x in B(H).

Then B(H) is a von Neumann algebra with a semiﬁnite, faithful, normal tracial weight τ .
For each 0 < p < ∞, the Schatten p-class Sp(H) is the associated non-commuative Lp-space
Lp(B(H), τ ).

Let

be the lower triangular subalgebra of B(H). From Example 6.1, B(H) can also be realized as a
crossed product l∞(Z) ⋊α Z of l∞(Z) by an action α, where the action α is determined by

A = {x ∈ B(H) : hxem, eni = 0, ∀n < m}

α(f )(m) = f (m − 1),

∀ f ∈ l∞(Z).

Moreover, it can be veriﬁed quickly that A, as a subalgebra of B(H), is l∞(Z)⋊α Z+ (see Lemma
6.2) is a semiﬁnite subdiagonal subalgebra of l∞(Z) ⋊α Z (see Example 2.6 in [25]). Thus from
Theorem 6.3, we have the following statements.

H ∞ be the lower triangular subalgebra of B(H), i.e.
