ABSTRACT

Context. More complete knowledge of galaxy evolution requires understanding the process of star formation and interaction between
the interstellar radiation ﬁeld and the interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic environments traversing a wide range of physical parameter
space. Here we focus on the impact of massive star formation on the surrounding low metallicity ISM in 30 Doradus in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). A low metal abundance, as is the case of some galaxies of the early universe, results in less ultra-violet
(UV) shielding for the formation of the molecular gas necessary for star formation to proceed. The half-solar metallicity gas in this
region is strongly irradiated by the super star cluster R136, making it an ideal laboratory to study the structure of the ISM in an
extreme environment.
Aims. Our goal is to construct a comprehensive, self-consistent picture of the density, radiation ﬁeld, and ISM structure in the most
active star-forming region in the LMC, 30 Doradus. Our spatially resolved study investigates the gas heating and cooling mechanisms,
particularly in the photo-dissociation regions where the chemistry and thermal balance are regulated by far-ultraviolet photons (6 eV<
hν <13.6 eV).
Methods. We present Herschel observations of far-infrared ﬁne-structure lines obtained with PACS and SPIRE/FTS. We have com-
bined atomic ﬁne-structure lines from Herschel and Spitzer observations with ground-based CO data to provide diagnostics on the
properties and the structure of the gas by modeling it with the Meudon PDR code. For each tracer we estimate the possible contami-
nation from the ionized gas in order to isolate the PDR component alone. We derive the spatial distribution of the radiation ﬁeld, the
pressure, the size, and the ﬁlling factor of the photodissociated gas and molecular clouds.
Results. We ﬁnd a range of pressure of ∼ 105 − 1.7× 106 cm−3 K and a range of incident radiation ﬁeld GUV∼ 102 − 2.5× 104 through
of 1 − 3 mag , which
PDR modeling. Assuming a plane-parallel geometry and a uniform medium, we ﬁnd a total extinction Amax
correspond to a PDR cloud size of 0.2 to 3pc, with small CO depth scale of 0.06 to 0.5pc. At least 90% of the [C ii] originates in PDRs
in this region, while a signiﬁcant fraction of the LFIR (up to 70% in some places) can be associated with an ionized gas component.
The high [O iii]/[C ii] ratio (2 to 60) throughout the observed map, correlated with the ﬁlling factor, reveals the porosity of the ISM in
this region, traversed by hard UV photons, surrounding small PDR clumps. We also determine the three dimensional structure of the
gas, showing that the clouds are distributed 20 to 80 pc away from the main ionizing cluster, R136.

1. Introduction
Galaxy evolution is dictated by progressive chemical enrichment
which is mostly achieved through a succession of star formation
episodes. The eﬀect of metal enrichment on what we observe to
be the star formation and interstellar medium (ISM) properties
remains elusive despite circumstantial evidence. For example,
reduced metallicity is expected to have important consequences
on the chemistry and the subsequent heating and cooling mech-
anisms of the gas and dust, directly aﬀecting the transition of the
atomic to molecular phase. In low metallicity environments, the
transition between C+/C/CO can be shifted further into the cloud
in physical scale, leaving a relatively larger photodissociation re-
gion (PDR) and a smaller CO core, compared to more metal-rich
environments, such as the Milky Way (Kaufman et al. 1999).
This eﬀect on the molecular cloud structure manifests itself in
an observed low CO luminosity in dwarf galaxies (e.g. Cormier

et al. 2014; Schruba et al. 2012) and requires a higher CO-to-H2
conversion factor, the XCO factor (Schruba et al. 2012; Bolatto
et al. 2013). It could also possibly be explained by a higher star
formation eﬃciency.

Dwarf galaxies in our local universe are the closest environ-
ments we can explore in detail to witness the interplay between
star formation and ISM under low metallicity conditions. Large
surveys probing the cooling of dwarf galaxies have been possible
for the ﬁrst time with the Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt
et al. 2010 ; e.g. the Dwarf Galaxy Survey, DGS ; Madden et al.
2013). Recent studies taking advantage of the Herschel sensitiv-
ity, have modeled the dust and gas properties of a wide range of
low metallicity galaxies on integrated galaxy scales (e.g. Rémy-
Ruyer et al. 2013, 2014; Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2015; Cormier et al.
2012, 2015; Cigan et al. 2015) and ﬁnd prominent diﬀerences be-
tween metal-rich and metal poor galaxies. For example, from far-

infrared (FIR) line ratios, Cormier et al. (2015) have determined
that radiation ﬁelds over global galaxy scales are harder in star-
forming dwarf galaxies, compared to more metal-rich galaxies.
Furthermore, the ﬁlling factor of the ionized gas appears larger
relatively to the neutral gas. As a consequence of the low metal-
licity and low extinction in dwarf galaxies, it is possible that a
signiﬁcant fraction of the molecular gas is not traced by CO, but
may be residing in the C+ or C0- emitting region for example (re-
ferred to as the "dark gas" in Wolﬁre et al. 2010), quantiﬁed in
low metallicity environments using C+ by Poglitsch et al. (1995)
and Madden et al. (1997) and more recently in our Galaxy by
Langer et al. (2014) and Pineda et al. (2014).

The Large Magellanic Cloud is our closest low metallicity
galaxy neighbor (1/2 Z(cid:12), Rolleston et al. 2002; Pagel 2003; 50
kpc, Walker 2012) allowing us to zoom into the ISM at the spa-
tial resolution of ∼ 12(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 3 pc) with Herschel. We focus on 30
Doradus (hereafter "30Dor"), which is the most prominent star-
forming region in the LMC and provides the best laboratory to
study the impact of a super star cluster (SSC) on the ISM. The
primary ultraviolet radiation source illuminating this region is
the SSC R136, containing 39 O3 stars (Hunter 1999), often con-
sidered to be the most extreme star-forming region in the Local
Group. The lower dust abundance of the LMC allows for deep
penetration of the ionizing radiation, creating extended PDR re-
gions and a more porous environment channeling the UV pho-
tons. ALMA observations from Indebetouw et al. (2013) have
revealed the clumpy structure of the molecular gas in 30Dor,
showing small 12CO ﬁlaments and clumps ((cid:46) 1 pc) covering
about 15% of their map. We examine the PDR conditions in
the neutral atomic gas using mainly [C ii] and [O i] observed by
Herschel in this region to unveil the spatial distribution of the
radiation ﬁeld and the structure of the photodissociated gas and
molecular clouds. The fraction of CO-dark gas based on this de-
tailed study will be quantiﬁed in a following study (Chevance et
al. in prep, hereafter paper II).

Observations of the ionized gas were conducted with Spitzer
and studied by Indebetouw et al. (2009). They showed in par-
ticular that photoionization dominates the ionization structure of
the gas over shocks in the H ii region around R136. A study of
the ﬁne structure lines of C+ and O0 in 30Dor has been pre-
viously carried out by Poglitsch et al. (1995), with the Kuiper
Airborne Observatory (KAO), at a resolution of ∼55(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 13 pc).
They found that a highly fragmented structure with high density
clouds (n = 103−104 cm−3), of low relative beam ﬁlling-factor of
CO compared to the PDR (4% of the clumps volume), bathed in
ionized gas could explain the observed ratio [C ii]/CO (ten times
higher than the Galactic value). Moreover, most of the molecular
gas may be present in the PDR, and faint in CO. Now, the PACS
observations provide better spatial resolution than the KAO data
and include other important tracers, with an improved signal-to-
noise ratio. Pineda et al. (2012) have investigated the CO and
[C i] emission observed with the NANTEN2 4-m telescope in
a 26(cid:48)(cid:48) beam, combined with the KAO observations of [C ii] in
30Dor and found likewise a very clumpy medium.

We present spectroscopic data of 30Dor in Section 2. Sec-
tion 3 describes the observed maps and some preliminary re-
sults. In Section 4 we use PDR models to determine the physical
parameters of the gas in PDR and we study the impact of metal-
licity and geometry on these parameters. We discuss our results
and build a comprehensive 3D picture of the region in Section 5.
Key results and conclusions are summarized in Section 6.

2. Observations and data preparation

2.1. Herschel PACS spectroscopy

We have mapped ﬁve ﬁne structure lines, [C ii] 158 µm, [N ii]
122 µm, [O i] 63 µm, [O i] 145 µm and [O iii] 88 µm using the
Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS, Poglitsch
et al. 2010) towards 30Dor. Properties of these lines are pre-
sented in Table 1 and the maps can be seen in Figure 1. These
observations, described in Madden et al. (2013), are part of the
Herschel key program, SHINING (P.I. E. Sturm). We also used
two additional pointings east of R136, which were observed by
Indebetouw et al (OT2) in [C ii], [O i] 63 µm, [N ii] 122 µm and
[O iii] 88 µm. The details of the observations are shown in Ap-
pendix A.
The PACS array is composed of 5 × 5 spatial pixels (or
spaxels) of 9.4(cid:48)(cid:48) covering a total ﬁeld of view of 47(cid:48)(cid:48). The ﬁne
structure lines [O i] 63 µm, [O iii] 88 µm, [N ii] 122 µm, [O i]
145 µm and [C ii] were mapped with respectively 25, 25, 4, 11
and 31 raster positions, covering approximately a 4(cid:48) × 5(cid:48) region
(56 pc×70 pc). The observations were done in unchopped mode.
The beam size is 9.5” at 60 µm, and 12” at 160 µm (PACS Ob-
server’s Manual 2011).

We refer to Cormier et al. (2015) for the full description
of the PACS observations and data reduction, and we summa-
rize here some of the main steps. The data were reduced with
the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE) v12.0.0
(Ott 2010) from Level 0 to Level 1. The Level 1 cubes, calibrated
in ﬂux and wavelength, are then exported and processed with
PACSman v3.61 (Lebouteiller et al. 2012) to ﬁt the lines and
create the individual maps. Each spectrum is ﬁtted with a second
order polynomial for the baseline and a Gaussian for the line.
Finally the individual rasters are projected onto a common grid
of 3(cid:48)(cid:48) × 3(cid:48)(cid:48) pixels ( 0.72 × 0.72 pc) to reconstruct the ﬁnal maps.
Uncertainties on the ﬁt and on the projection are estimated using
a Monte-Carlo simulation. All of the lines are well detected ev-
erywhere in the map (Fig. 1). The weakest line, [N ii] 122 µm has
a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 5 and 30 for most of the
mapped area. The emission line [O i] 145 µm has a SNR between
7 and 90 and the SNR is above 10 for all of the other lines.

The observed intensities match well those detected with the
Kuiper Airborne Observatory by Poglitsch et al. (1995) with a
lower spatial resolution (55(cid:48)(cid:48) for [C ii] and [O i] 145 µm and 22(cid:48)(cid:48)
for [O i] 63 µm). For example they found a maximum [C ii] in-
tensity of 10−3 erg s−1cm−2sr−1, and we measure a maximum
intensity of 1.1 × 10−3 erg s−1cm−2sr−1 on PACS data convolved
to the same resolution. They are also similar to the [C ii] inten-
sities measured by Requena-Torres (in prep) using the GREAT
instrument on SOFIA.

2.2. Herschel SPIRE spectroscopy

The SPIRE instrument includes an Imaging Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS) covering the wavelength ranges 194–324
and 316–672 µm (SPIRE Short Wavelength SSW and SPIRE
Long Wavelength SLW arrays respectively). 30Dor was ob-
served with the SPIRE FTS in the high spectral resolution (∆ν ∼
1.2 GHz), intermediate spatial sampling mode. In the intermedi-
ate spatial sampling mode, SLW and SSW are moved between
four jiggling positions with a spacing of ∼28(cid:48)(cid:48) and ∼16(cid:48)(cid:48) respec-
tively. The observations were performed on January 8, 2013 (ob-
servation IDs: 1342219550, 1342257932 and 1342262908) with
a total integration time of ∼ 15400s.

We process the FTS data using the Herschel Interactive Pro-
cessing Environment (HIPE) version 11.0.2825 and the SPIRE
calibration version 11.0 (Fulton et al. 2010; Swinyard et al.
2013). We use the method from Wu et al. (2013) to derive in-
tegrated intensity images and their uncertainties. This script has
been recently used to generate FTS spectral cubes for M83 (Wu
et al. 2015). A combination of parabola (continuum) and sinc
(emission) functions is used to model a spectral line. The spec-
tra are then projected onto a grid that covers a 5(cid:48) × 5(cid:48) area with a
pixel size of 15(cid:48)(cid:48) (roughly corresponding to the detector spacing
for SSW). We perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 300 iter-
ations to estimate the uncertainties on the spectra, as described
in details in Lee et al (in prep). The SNR is between 1 and 8 for
[N ii] 205 µm and between 0.5 and 5 for [C i] 370 µm. The [C i]
609 µm is weaker and the SNR is below 2.

The maps of [N ii] 205 µm and [C i] 370 and 609 µm are pre-
sented in Figures 1 and 2. Properties of these lines are presented
in table 1. CO transitions from J = 4 – 3 to J = 13 – 12 were also
observed in 30Dor and will be presented in Lee et al. (in prep).

2.3. Herschel and Spitzer photometry

To constrain the PDR models, we need to calculate the infrared
luminosity, which requires photometry data from mid-infrared
(MIR) to sub-millimeter. PACS and SPIRE maps of the Large
Magellanic Cloud at 100, 160 250, 350 and 500 µm were ﬁrst
published in Meixner et al. (2013) as part of the HERITAGE
project. We also use the observations of 30Dor obtained as part
of the Spitzer (Werner et al. 2004) Legacy program "Surveying
the Agents of a Galaxy’s Evolution" (SAGE ; Meixner et al.
2006). We used the four channels of IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004)
at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 µm and MIPS (Rieke et al. 2004) obser-
vations at 24 and 70 µm. The MIPS 24 µm map is saturated in
several pixels. We use the IRS spectra (Indebetouw et al. 2009;
see also Sect. 2.4) to calculate the 24 µm synthetic photometry
in the MIPS 24 bandpass and compare to the original map, with
excellent agreement in parts where the Spitzer/MIPS map is not
saturated. Table 2 summarizes the photometry data we use to
construct the infrared luminosity, associated with their spatial
resolution.

2.4. Spitzer / IRS spectroscopy

The Spitzer IRS low resolution data have been initially presented
in Indebetouw et al. (2009). The observed lines and their spatial
resolution are listed in Table 1. We have reduced again the low
spectral resolution cubes with CUBISM (Smith et al. 2007a) as
part of an eﬀort to measure lines that have not been investigated
yet in detail, in particular the H2 lines, [Si ii] and [Ar ii]. The re-
solving power of both the short-wavelength/low-resolution (SL)
and the long-wavelength/low-resolution (LL) modules range ap-
proximately from 60 to 120 (Spitzer Observer’s Manual 7.1
20061). The maps of [Si ii], [S iii] 18 µm and [S iii] 33 µm are
presented in Figure 1.

We use the total emission of the polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbon molecules (PAHs) that has been ﬁtted by Indebetouw
et al. (2009) using the package PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2007b).
Finally, we also use the Spitzer IRS high-resolution spectra pre-
sented by Lebouteiller et al. (2008) to measure the H2 lines.

MOPRA map (right). All of the maps are shown at their original resolution, in W m−2 sr−1. The circle shows the location of R136. Table 1 and
Section 2 describe these observations in detail.

2.5. Ground-based observations

Low-J CO transitions are required for additional constraints for
the PDR modeling. We use the CO J = 1 – 0 transition observed
with MOPRA (Wong et al. 2011) and CO J = 3 – 2 observed
with ASTE (Minamidani et al. 2011, see Figure 2). The spatial
resolutions for the MOPRA and ASTE data are 42(cid:48)(cid:48) and 22(cid:48)(cid:48)
respectively.

The Hα emission, which we use as a qualitative tracer of the
ionized gas, was observed with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory (CTIO) Curtis Schmidt telescope as part of the
Magellanic Clouds Survey (MCELS, private communication;
R.Leiton) at a resolution of ∼ 5(cid:48)(cid:48).

The photometry bands are used to determine the infrared
luminosity with our spectral energy distribution (SED) model
(see Sect. 2.7). Since we wish to perform the PDR analysis on
the smallest possible scale (i.e. limited by the PSF of the PACS
[C ii] map), we calculate the infrared luminosity at the resolution
of 12(cid:48)(cid:48), which is also the resolution of the PACS 160 µm band.
We have compared this approximated infrared luminosity to that
determined using all available bands, i.e., including the SPIRE
bands (250, 300 and 500 µm). We ﬁnd little diﬀerence on the in-
tegrated luminosity per surface area. Thus we include only the
bands between 24 and 160 µm to ﬁt the SED at the best spatial
resolution possible.

2.6. Convolution kernels

As we use line ratios of diﬀerent wavelengths and diﬀerent in-
struments (see Table 1), we must ﬁrst convolve the maps to the
same resolution. We add quadratically 12% uncertainties to the
PACS maps to account for the absolute calibration uncertain-
ties (PACS Observer’s Manual v2.5.1). When we use only PACS
observations, all of the maps are convolved to the resolution of
PACS at 160 µm (12(cid:48)(cid:48) or ∼ 3 pc), using the kernels from Aniano
et al. (2011).

When we combine PACS, SPIRE and ground based spec-
troscopy data together to include the [C i] and CO lines (see
Sect. 4.4), all of the maps are smoothed to match the resolution
of 42(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 10 pc), limited by the SPIRE long wavelength data.
For this, we use the appropriate kernels to convolve a PACS
point spread function (modeled by Aniano et al. 2011) to the
SPIRE/FTS beam proﬁle (ﬁtted by a two-dimensional Hermite-
Gaussian function) at the lowest resolution, essentially following
the method by Gordon et al. (2008).

2.7. Infrared luminosity maps

For each pixel of the map, we construct the full MIR to submm
SED, to which we apply the dust SED model of Galliano et al.
(2011, AC composition). This is a phenomenological SED ﬁt-
ting procedure with which we derive the resolved total infrared
luminosity (LTIR) between 3 and 1000 µm, as well as the far-
infrared luminosity (LFIR) between 60 and 200 µm. This model
was designed to ﬁt the Herschel broadband photometry of the
LMC, still remaining consistent with the elemental abundances.
The free parameters include the dust mass (from which the ex-
tinction magnitude in V band, Adust
V , can be derived), the min-
imum starlight intensity, the diﬀerence between the maximum
and minimum starlight intensities, the starlight intensity distribu-
tion power-law index and the PAH-to-total dust mass ratio fPAH.
The ﬁnal map of LTIR, which integrates the SED ﬁt between 3
and 1000 µm, can be seen in Figure 1. Contrary to other dust
parameters, the infrared luminosity is very marginally model de-
pendent. It depends mainly on the wavelength coverage of the
photometric constraints used, which in our case is suﬃcient. For

the PDR modeling (see Section 4) we use the LFIR integrated
between 60 and 200 µm. The SED model is better constrained
in this limited wavelength range compared to the ﬁt including
longer wavelengths so this leads to less uncertainties on LFIR.
However, even with no constraint longward 160 µm, the LTIR of
30Dor is still relatively well constrained, as the dust in this re-
gion is suﬃciently warm to peak at much shorter wavelengths.

3.1. General morphology
Figure 1 shows the maps of Hα, [O iii], [S iii], [N ii], [C ii], [Si ii]
and [O i] lines at their initial resolution. We also show the LTIR
(integrated between 3 and 1000 µm) as well as the PAH emis-
sion (LPAH). The emission of all lines is distributed in the north-
ern and southern lobes around R136. The emission of all lines
peaks near the same location within 5 pc towards the northern
lobe, with some inhomogeneous emission in the south. The spa-
tial distributions of the [C i], CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) emission are
presented in Figure 2. They show two lobes of emission as well,
and the peaks of both the [C i] and CO emission are shifted about
20(cid:48)(cid:48) north of the peak of [C ii].

The [C ii], [O i] and LPAH follow approximately each other
throughout the map. The [O i] 63 µm, [O i] 145 µm and [C ii]
emission lines, as well as LPAH, are PDR tracers, although there
may be a diﬀuse component as well, which could be contributing
to the emission of [C ii] (see Section 3.2).

The distributions of the Hα, [O iii] 88 µm, [S iii] and [N ii]
lines have a structure diﬀerent from the neutral PDR tracers [C ii]
and [O i]. The spatial distributions of [O iii], [S iii] and [N ii] fol-
low well the distribution of the ionized gas traced by Hα emis-
sion and show in particular a characteristic arm-like structure in
the north-east of R136. The ionization potentials of O++ and S++
are respectively 35 eV and 23.3 eV (see table 1), so [O iii] 88 µm
and both [S iii] 18 µm and [S iii] 33 µm probe the highly ionized
gas. The peak of [O iii] is shifted from that of [C ii] toward the
south, in the direction of R136. The peak of [N ii] 122 µm is lo-
cated between the peaks of [O iii] 88 µm and [O i], as expected
from the values of the ionization potential of each specie. [N ii]
traces the low density and low-excitation ionized gas (critical
density for collision with electrons are ∼310 cm−3 and ∼48 cm−3
for [N ii] 122 µm and [N ii] 205 µm respectively).

The distributions of [Si ii] 35 µm and LTIR emissions share
properties both with the ionized gas ([O iii] and [S iii]) and the
PDR tracers ([O i] and [C ii]). The [Si ii] 35 µm line and the LTIR
can in principle be used as a PDR tracer, but we also ﬁnd in
the maps some features that seem spatially associated with the
ionized gas as well. This is discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4.

Figure 3 shows the diﬀerent layers of the ISM, from the
ionization front near the stellar cluster, where the highly ionized
gas traced by the [S iv] 10.5 µm emission is located, to lower
ionization states ([Ne ii] 15.6 µm) and then to the PDRs traced
by [C ii]. The CO peak is located close to the [C ii] peak.
This spatial disposition suggests that R136 dominates the
photoionization. We can also see that the northern region seems
to be quite well shielded from ionizing UV photons, since
[C ii] is very extended in this direction while the tracers of the
ionized gas show a sharp decrease on the other side of the Hα arc.

The [O iii] 88 µm is the brightest FIR line in 30Dor, as in
N11, the second largest H ii region of the LMC (Lebouteiller
et al. 2012), the dwarf galaxy Haro 11 (Cormier et al. 2012)

and in most of the dwarf galaxies (Cormier et al. 2015), in-
tegrated over full galaxy scales. This was ﬁrst noted in sev-
eral dwarf irregular galaxies in Hunter et al. (2001). [O iii] is
brighter than [C ii] by a factor of 2 to 60 throughout our 30Dor
map. Figure 4 shows the ratio [O iii]/LTIR versus [C ii]/LTIR in
30Dor. Cormier et al. (2015) already noted the elevated [O iii]
88 µm/LTIR in dwarf galaxies compared to the normal galaxies
of Brauher et al. (2008). Given that it requires 35 eV to ionize
O+ to O++, this suggests the presence of high temperature stars
throughout the region. The range of [C ii]/LTIR values covered in
30Dor is very broad (more than an order of magnitude) and they
cover almost the entire range of [C ii]/LTIR observed in the wide
range of galaxy type in Brauher et al. sample. The [O iii]/LTIR
distribution is narrower (about a factor of 6 over the map). The
regions with the highest LTIR are the peaks of [O iii] and [C ii]
(Fig. 3, regions C and B). The highest [C ii]/LTIR ratio is found
in the northern part of 30Dor (near region A): this is due to the
fact that LTIR decreases more rapidly than [C ii] with increasing
distance from the exciting sources.

In the regions where [C ii] is the brightest, the line intensities
of [O i] 63 µm and [Si ii] are similar to the [C ii] intensity.
[O i] 63 µm is everywhere at least ten times brighter than [O i]
145 µm. The map of [N ii] 122 µm is the smallest and this line
is also the faintest of our PACS lines (at least 200 times fainter
than [O iii]), but the SNR throughout the region mapped is ≥5.
The [N ii] 205 µm emission is 1 to 3 times fainter than [N ii]

122 µm.

3.2. Origin of [C ii] and [Si ii] emission

Because the ionization potential of C0, 11.3 eV, is lower than
13.6 eV, the [C ii] line can originate either from the PDRs or
from the ionized gas. We thus need to investigate the possible
contribution from the ionized gas and from PDRs to the [C ii]
emission before we can use it as a PDR tracer and a constraint
for PDR modeling.

C+/C
N+/N

Following the analysis of Oberst et al. (2011), we use the fact
that the ratio [C ii]/[N ii] 122 µm can be calculated theoretically
in the ionized gas, and that [N ii] originates only from the ionized
gas. We calculate the ﬁne-structure level populations of C+ and
N+ as a function of the density using the theoretical collisional
rates. We then apply a correction factor due to the ionic abun-
dance fraction
. We used the MAPPINGS III photoioniza-
tion grids (Allen et al. 2008) and found that this fraction depends
little on the conditions (ionization parameter, starburst age, den-
sity) with a value around 0.85± 0.15. Finally, we scale the emis-
sion ratio with the observed elemental abundances of C and N in
30Dor from Pellegrini et al. (2011) listed in Table 3. The ﬁnal ra-
tio [C ii]/[N ii] 122 µm depends strongly on the electron density
between 1 and 1000 cm−3. Since the critical densities for [N ii]
122 µm and [N ii] 205 µm are 310 cm−3 and 50 cm−3 respectively
(Table 1), the ratio [N ii] 122 µm/[N ii] 205 µm is a good density
tracer for the relatively low density ionized gas phase. We calcu-
late the ratio [N ii] 122 µm/[N ii] 205 µm to determine the density
using the theoretical curve from Bernard-Salas et al. (2012) (see
Figure 5). This ratio depends only slightly on the temperature
; we choose a typical temperature of 10 000K. The calculated
density presented in Figure 6 ranges from 10 to 100 cm−3. Our
values fall in the low density regime of the [S iii] line ratio, which
is sensitive to high density (ncrit = 1.5×104 cm−3 for [S iii] 18 µm

Fig. 6. Electron density in cm−3 calculated from the ratio [N ii] 122 µm
/ [N ii] 205 µm. The pixel size is 20(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 5pc). The black contours repre-
sent the emission of the ionized gas tracer [S iii] 18 µm.

and ncrit = 4.1×103 cm−3 for [S iii] 33 µm), and does not provide
a useful constraint.

If the [C ii] emission would originate in the low density ion-
ized gas traced by [N ii], the [C ii]/[N ii] 122 µm ratio would be
∼ 0.5 − 1.3 (Fig. 5). However, the observed ratio is signiﬁcantly
higher by a factor of ∼ 10 than this theoretical ratio in the ion-
ized gas. At least 90% of the [C ii] is expected to be emitted
from PDRs in the entire mapped region. The [C ii] emission can
be considered to be a reliable tracer of the PDR gas in 30Dor.

Since the density is known and [Ar ii] originates from
the ionized gas, we can also calculate the theoretical ratio
[C ii]/[Ar ii] in the ionized gas. Similarly, comparing the ob-
served ratio [C ii]/[Ar ii] to the theoretical ratio in the ionized

gas, we also deduce that a large fraction (> 95%) of the [C ii]
emission originates from the PDRs.

[Si ii] emission can also originate from PDR or ionized gas.
We proceed with the same method to separate the emission of
the ionized gas from that of the neutral gas. The critical density
of [Si ii] is close to that of [Ar ii] (3.4 × 105 cm−3 and 4.0 × 105
cm−3 respectively, see Table 1) and both the observed ratios of
[Si ii]/[Ar ii] and [Si ii]/[N ii] are consistent with 60% to 90% of
the [Si ii] emission originating from the PDRs.

3.3. The photoelectric heating efﬁciency

The top panel of Figure 7 shows the observed [C ii]/LFIR ratio as
a function of LFIR for every pixel of the PACS map. The ratio
[C ii]/LFIR is often used to estimate the fraction of energy ab-
sorbed by dust that is used to heat the gas via the photoelectric
eﬀect (the photoelectric heating eﬃciency). This ratio ranges be-
tween 0.1% and 1% with a signiﬁcant scatter – about one order
of magnitude. We observe a tendency of decreasing [C ii]/LFIR as
LFIR increases (same trend as in Stacey et al. 2010), with a slope
of −3.6 ± 0.2. However, when we add the [O i] 63 µm emission
(lower panel of Figure 7), we ﬁnd a smaller dispersion (with
a factor of 7) and also a ﬂatter relation between ([O i] 63 µm+
[C ii]) / LFIR and LFIR, with a slope of −1.4±0.3 for the linear re-
gression. Both [O i] and [C ii] are contributing noticeably to the
cooling of the gas, as shown in Lebouteiller et al. (2012).
the

ratio
([O i] 63 µm+[C ii])/LFIR is mostly due to the ionized com-
ponent part in LFIR. Indeed, the ratio ([O i] 63 µm+[C ii])/LFIR is
well correlated with the ratio [O iii] 88 µm/[C ii], and it decreases
with increasing [O iii] 88 µm/[C ii], which is representative of
the ionization state of the gas. If we subtract the IR contribution
from the ionized gas (as described in Section 3.4), we ﬁnd
that the ratio ([O i] 63 µm+[C ii])/LFIR to be fairly constant and
narrow.

Section 3.4).

3.4. The origin of the FIR emission

Although grains and PAHs in the PDRs contribute to the FIR
emission, a fraction of LFIR can also come from the H ii re-
gions, from big grains in equilibrium with the interstellar radi-
ation ﬁeld (ISRF). In this section, we inspect the origin of the
LFIR throughout the map, to separate the fraction in the ion-
ized gas component from that in the PDR component. In or-
der to separate the emission from these two components, we as-
sume that the PAH emission traces the PDRs and [O iii] traces
the ionized phase. Indeed, we can see in Figure 1 that the spa-
tial distribution of the LFIR shows features similar to the PAH
emission or any other neutral atomic gas tracer ([C ii], [O i]),
while other features seem to be spatially associated with [O iii]
or any other ionized gas tracers (Hα, [S iii]). To disentangle the
fraction of LFIR in the ionized gas, we assume a linear relation
such as: LFIR = α × LPAH+β × L[O iii]. The pair of (α ; β) val-
ues is calculated using a multiple linear regression using all of
the pixels in the map and is equal to (5.4 ; 11.5). This decom-
position implicitly assumes that the PAH-to-dust mass fraction
is constant in PDRs and zero in H ii regions. The left panel of
Figure 9 presents the correlation between [O iii] 88 µm/LFIR and
LPAH/LFIR. The solid line on this plot shows the linear relation
deﬁned by:
. With this method, we are
seeking a ﬁrst order correction of the total LFIR to be able to use
it for the PDR modeling. The modeled LFIR reproduces the ob-
served LFIR within 30% on average. We determine the proportion
of LFIR coming from the PDRs as LPDR
= α LPAH. The result is

presented on the right panel of Figure 9. On the north side of the
map, far from the ionizing cluster, up to 90% of the FIR emis-
sion is expected to come from the PDRs, while on the east of
the map, near the R136 cluster, about 70% of the FIR emission
is expected to come from the ionized gas. We subtract the esti-
mated fraction of LFIR emitted in the ionized gas, using LPDR
FIR for
the PDR modeling.

local variations.

To study how the distribution of starlight aﬀects the ob-
served photoelectric heating eﬃciency, we compare the average
modeled starlight <U> from the SED modeling (see Sect. 3.4)
with [C ii]/LTIR (Fig. 10). Note that we use the total LTIR here
since we do not know the fraction of the PDR component
for the DGS sources. We compare our spatially resolved val-
ues with the distribution of <U> and [C ii]/LTIR from the inte-
grated DGS compact sources of Cormier et al. (2015) and Rémy-
Ruyer et al. (2014). More details and references can be found in
Cormier et al. (2015). We see that 30Dor covers a large range in
[C ii]/LTIR, approximately one order of magnitude, and approxi-
mately one order of magnitude in <U>.

There is a trend of decreasing [C ii]/LTIR as <U> is increas-
ing, following the trend observed by Cormier et al. (2015),
showing an apparent line deﬁcit at high <U> values. This is
probably an eﬀect of the contribution of the ionized component
to the infrared luminosity, as shown in Figure 8. The [O iii] peak

(Cormier et al. 2014).

(region C in Figure 3) is the region with the highest <U>: it is
the closest region to R136 in physical distance (see 5.3) ; the
gas is mostly ionized. This region corresponds also to the lowest
[C ii]/LTIR ratio.

To compare one of the primary PDR coolants with the
CO(1−0), we show in Figure 11 [C ii]/CO versus LFIR at the res-
olution of 42(cid:48)(cid:48). [C ii]/CO(1–0) throughout 30Dor is ∼ 5 × 104 −
3 × 105. The observed range of the ratio [C ii]/CO(1-0) is very
broad. These values are about a factor 10 higher than the typical
values for spiral or starburst galaxies (∼ 2000 − 8000; Stacey
et al. 1991; Negishi et al. 2001), and more in agreement with
the range of values measured for integrated dwarf galaxies as
already noticed in Poglitsch et al. (1995), Madden et al. (1997)

4. PDR modeling
In this section, we model the infrared observations of 30Dor us-
ing the Meudon PDR code and present results describing the
properties of the gas.

4.1. The Meudon PDR model
The Meudon PDR code2 is described in Le Petit et al. (2006),
Le Bourlot et al. (2012) and Bron et al. (2014). It computes the
atomic and molecular structure of interstellar clouds. The model
considers a 1D stationary plane parallel slab of gas and dust illu-
minated by a radiation ﬁeld (from UV to radio) arising from one
or both sides. The radiative transfer is solved in an iterative way
at each point of the cloud by taking into account absorption by
gas and dust and scattering and emission by dust. For the present
work, we used a development version (v1.6.0) with updates that
includes the computation of X-ray radiative transfer and the im-
pact on the chemistry and thermal balance of the cloud (Godard
et al. in prep).

4.2. Input and output parameters
We describe here some of the conﬁguration parameters of the
model. We assume that the gas in each pixel can be modeled
by a single cloud of pressure P, illuminated by a radiation ﬁeld.
The standard radiation ﬁeld used in the Meudon PDR code is
that observed in the solar neighborhood (Mathis et al. 1983) and
is scaled with the parameter GUV to control the intensity of the
incident radiation ﬁeld on each side of the cloud. For GUV = 1,
the integrated energy density between 911.8 Å to 2400 Å is 6.8×
10−14 erg cm−3. In the model we ran, GUV ranges between 1 and
105 on one side and is ﬁxed to 1 on the other side to expose this
side to the general interstellar ﬁeld. The pressure ranges between
104 and 108 cm−3 K. The pressure is constant throughout the
cloud, however a constant density model has also been explored
(Sect. 4.5). We have investigated the possibility of adding X-
rays in the model, but found that they are not needed to explain
the PACS observed data (Sect. 5.5). The visual extinction of the
entire cloud has been varied from Amax
=
10 magnitude. We estimate the mass fraction of PAHs from our
SED modeling (Sect. 2.7). We ﬁnd that fPAH = 1% is adapted
for 30Dor. We use elemental abundances as in Pellegrini et al.
(2011) for He, C, N, O, Ne, Si and S, to reproduce as accurately
as possible the conditions in 30Dor (see table 3). The dust-to-
gas mass ratio is ﬁxed to 0.5 × 10−3 based on our SED modeling
(Sect. 2.7).

= 1 magnitude to Amax

The output quantities computed by the model include the in-
tegrated line intensities and LFIR, the ionic and molecular abun-
dances, the emissivities and the chemical and thermal structure
of the cloud. An example of the variations of the local gas phase
abundances for some elements as a function of the depth into the
cloud is presented in Figure 12 for a typical cloud of Amax
V of 10,
with a constant pressure of P = 106 cm−3 K, illuminated by a
radiation ﬁeld of GUV = 3000.

We use [O i], [C ii] and LPDR

FIR to constrain P and GUV in the
PDR model pixel by pixel. We consider here the observed [C ii]

ized gas is low (Sect. 3.2) and we correct the LFIR emission to
remove the contamination from the component associated with
the ionized gas (see Sections 3.2 and 3.4). At ﬁrst we let Amax
vary freely as this set of tracers cannot constrain this parameter
and it has no inﬂuence on the resulting best model. This is illus-
trated in Figure 13, where we show the ratios R between several
modeled line ratios and their observations for simulated clouds
of diﬀerent total depths. The ratios [O i]/[C ii], ([O i]+[C ii])/LFIR

ionized gas we found a pressure P = 105 − 106 cm−3 K for a typ-
ical temperature of 10 000K (see Section 3.2). We ﬁnd a similar
pressure in the PDR, suggesting that the gas may well be in pres-
sure equilibrium. However, it must also be noted that Pellegrini
et al. (2011) ﬁnd a pressure somewhat larger using optical lines.
Finally, a low GUV solution results in large physical distances be-
tween the clouds and R136 (see Section 5.3), signiﬁcantly larger
(by a factor of ∼ 10 to 100) than found in Pellegrini et al. (2011).
We ﬁnd GUV ranging between 102 and 3 × 104 throughout
the region and P between 105 cm−3 K and 1.7 × 106 cm−3
K, with χ2 ∼ 10−1 to 10−2 over the map3. The best P and
GUV maps are represented in Figure 15. The peaks of GUV
and P are almost co-spatial. The maximum is located north of
R136, at the southern edge of the [O iii] peak. It shows that
there is a void around R136 and that the radiation ﬁeld is ﬁrst
interacting with any matter a few parsecs away from the cluster.
Details regarding the structure around R136 will be discussed in
Section 5.3. The uncertainties associated with the observations,
including calibration errors, lead to uncertainties on GUV of
+55%/-40% and on P of +/-12%.

([O i] 63 µm/[C ii])observed
([O i] 63 µm/[C ii])predicted

The value of the observed ratio [O i] 63 µm/[C ii] is lower
than the ratio predicted by the model based on [C ii], [O i] 145 µm
and LPDR
FIR by a factor of 1.3-2.5. This discrepancy between the
predicted and the observed values may be due to optical depth
eﬀects of the [O i] 63 µm line (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Abel
et al. 2007) or to absorption by cold gas along the line of sight
(Liseau et al. 2006). As we can see from Figure 16 on the left,
the lowest values of the ratio
corre-
spond to the locations of the highest pressure. Since the diﬀer-
ence between the observations and the model prediction seems
to correlate spatially with the pressure here, it is probably not
due to foreground absorption, but most likely from local eﬀects.
We can also note that the observed ratio [O i] 145 µm/[O i] 63 µm
is larger than 0.1 in many pixels, which is an indication of optical
depth eﬀects in [O i] 63 µm (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985). In the
best-solution model, the predicted ratio [O i] 145 µm/[O i] 63 µm
is 0.04. The model accounts for the opacity of the lines for one
cloud, but not between several clouds along the line of sight. If
we examine one of the best solutions for region B ([C ii] peak in
Figure 3), the model predicts an opacity of 0.6 for [O i] 63 µm at
AV = 1 while that of [C ii] is still below 0.1. Thus, if we have sev-
eral components along the line of sight, the [C ii] intensity can be
multiplied by the number of components, while the [O i] 63 µm
intensity increases less than linearly.

4.4. Determination of Amax
In this section we investigate the inﬂuence of Amax
(that is, the
total depth of the cloud, in magnitude) on the line ratios pre-
dicted by the Meudon PDR code. In Figure 17, we show the
ratios R between several modeled line ratios and their observa-
tions for simulated clouds of diﬀerent total depths. While the ra-
tios [O i]/[C ii], ([O i]+[C ii])/LFIR and [C i] 609 µm/[C i] 370 µm
are not very sensitive to Amax
(Fig. 13) , the ratios [C ii]/[C i]
and [C ii]/CO vary by several orders of magnitude with the to-
tal depth of the simulated cloud, because they involve tracers
that originate from diﬀerent depths into the cloud. The observed
ratios [C ii]/[C i], [C ii]/CO(1-0) and [C ii]/CO(3-2) can be repro-

where I j(x, y) is the observed value of the ratio i, for a given

served ratio and M j is the value predicted by the model for the
ratio j. N is the number of constraints (independent ratios) that
are used. Ratios of line intensities are used instead of absolute
values. In this case, if species are co-spatial in the cloud and if
there are no opacity eﬀects, we can then ignore the eﬀect of an
area ﬁlling factor diﬀerent than one and the presence of several
clouds along the line of sight (see Sect. 5.1).

As an example, we present in Figure 14 the values of
GUV and P that reproduce the observed values for the ratios
([O i] 145 µm+[C ii])/LPDR
FIR in blue, [O i] 145 µm/[C ii] in red and
[O i] 63 µm/[C ii] in cyan for two pixels of the map of 30Dor
at 12(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution, located in the regions D and C (Fig. 3). We
can see in these ﬁgures that the constraint given by the ratio
[O i] 63 µm/[C ii] is never consistent with the other ratios within
the error bars. This is likely due to optical depth eﬀects in the
[O i] 63 µm line, as we show later in this section. For now, we
will not consider this line to constrain the parameters of the
model.

First, we use the ratios ([O i] 145 µm+[C ii])/LPDR

FIR and
[O i] 145 µm/[C ii] to constrain GUV and P. Thus we are lim-
ited by the PACS resolution of 12(cid:48)(cid:48) and by the spatial cov-
erage of the [O i] 145 µm map. We do not use the ratio
[C i] 370 µm/[C i] 609 µm, which does not bring strong con-
straints on GUV and P as the error bars are very large. We have
then the same number of constraints and parameters. We can
note from Figure 14 that there is a degeneracy between a high
GUV/low P solution and a low GUV/high P solution. The addition
of the ratio [C ii]/[C i] or [C ii]/CO does not help to break this
degeneracy since they are very dependent on Amax
(Sect. 4.4).
However, the high GUV/low P solution, highlighted with a green
cross in Figure 14, has a lower χ2 and is preferred based on the
following arguments. Indeed, the high P solution requires high
optical depths in [O i] 63 µm ([O i] 63 µm is over-predicted by a
factor of up to 9, see below), while the Amax
(determined as in
Section 4.4) would be very low (< 1 mag). In addition, in the

in Section 4.3. However we keep in mind that the determination
of this parameter is strongly dependent on the geometry of the
model. This will be discussed in more details in Section 5.2.

4.5. Isobaric versus isochoric case

We considered a constant density model to compare our results
with our isobaric model and with previous PDR model results.
We use the same set of line ratios and the same χ2 method to
ﬁnd the best radiation ﬁeld and density predicted by an isochoric
model.

Article number, page 12 of 20

We ﬁnd a similar map for GUV compared to our isobaric
model, with a maximum of 20% diﬀerence between both cases.
For the isochoric model, the density ranges between 3 × 102 to
1.4×104 cm−3, with a spatial distribution quite similar to P in the
isobaric case. This range of values is similar to those found by
previous studies (e.g. Poglitsch et al. 1995; Bolatto et al. 1999;
Röllig et al. 2006; Pineda et al. 2012). From the results of the
isobaric model, we determine the density at the surface of the
PDR. This initial density is about 1/2 to 2/3 the density deter-
mined with the isochoric model. In conclusion, the results from
these two models are similar when applied to PDR line ratios.

Pak et al. (1998) measure H2 (1, 0) S (1) and (2, 1) S (1) close
to the CO (1-0) peak of 30Dor, with a beam of 81(cid:48)(cid:48). We compare
these observations to the predictions of our model at 81(cid:48)(cid:48) resolu-
tion. Our map does not fully cover the 81(cid:48)(cid:48) beam. However, we
calculate lower limits of 6×10−6 and 3×10−6 erg s−1cm−2sr−1 on
the H2 (1, 0) S (1) and (2, 1) S (1) emission respectively. There is
a good agreement with the values measured by Pak et al. (1998)
(10.8 × 10−6 and 4.0 × 10−6 erg s−1cm−2sr−1 respectively) con-
sidering we are missing some fraction of their beam. Rubio et al.
(1998) present H2 (1, 0) S (1) observations at 1.16(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution.
Their peak value of 4− 6.10−5 erg s−1cm−2sr−1 is also consistent
with our model results.
Yeh et al. (2015) have presented an H2 (1, 0) S (1) map of
the entire 30Dor nebula at 1(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution. The peak H2 surface
brightness in their region A is 9.15 × 10−5 erg s−1cm−2sr−1. Our
model predicts a maximum H2 surface brightness of 5.3 × 10−5
erg s−1cm−2sr−1 located near the [C ii] peak, for a 12(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution.
This is about a factor of 2 lower than the observed value, but it
may be explained by the lower resolution used in our study and
the fact that the H2 emission could originate from clouds smaller
than the PACS beam size.

5. Discussion

5.1. Filling factor

The model assumes that the PDR ﬁlling factor is unity, i.e., that
the surface area of PDRs is equal to the beam area. If only part
of the beam is covered or, on the contrary, if several clouds are
present along the line of sight, the radiation emitted in the LFIR
and in cooling lines will be diﬀerent than the model prediction
for optically thin lines. The ﬁlling factor will be, respectively,
lower or higher than 1.

GUV and P have been determined only using ratios of lines
coming from the same phase of the ISM. Thus, they do not de-
pend on the ﬁlling factor because each line is aﬀected by the
same factor. The area ﬁlling factor, ΦA, can then be estimated
from the ratio of the observed intensity over the predicted inten-
sity (for which ΦA = 1) for an individual line.

and [C ii]/[C i] 370 µm.

However, the predictions of the models start to diverge
deeper into the cloud, in particular for molecular lines. Indeed,
for an isobaric cloud of Amax
of 3, the density rises by about a
factor of 10, as the temperature drops, between the surface of
the PDR and the core of the cloud (Fig. 12). This implies that
the CO lines are emitted at lower AV in a isobaric model com-
pared to an isochoric model. As a consequence, the Amax
V probed
by the observed CO lines is lower for an isobaric model than for
an isochoric model. For example, the Amax
V probed with the low-J
CO transitions (J=3–2 and J=1–0) is slightly higher for the iso-
choric model (∼ 2 − 4 mag) than the 1 − 3 mag we ﬁnd with the
isobaric model. In conclusion, choosing the isobaric case is im-
portant to reproduce the higher J transitions of CO and quantify
the CO-dark gas (see paper II), but it has little consequences for
the results derived in this paper.

4.6. Model predictions for H2 lines
H2 is barely detected in the Spitzer/IRS low-resolution observa-
tions of 30Dor (Indebetouw et al. 2009). The model-predicted H2
(0,0) S (2) emission at 12.3 µm is 10 to 50 times lower than the
upper limit from the observations. However, the emission from
the high-resolution spectrum (Sect. 2.4) is in better agreement
(by a factor of 2 to 5) with the model prediction.

LPDR
FIR and [C ii] are both emitted by PDRs and scale with the
ﬁlling factor in the same way. Thus, we can determine ΦA either

[C ii]predicted

ure 16. ΦA is the smallest (about 0.6) near the peak of GUV, in
region C (Fig. 3). The maximum value is ∼ 9 on the north-east
of the cluster. As stated earlier, an area ﬁlling factor greater than
one means that several clouds covering the entire pixel are along
the line of sight. Note that this approach is marginally coherent
near the peak of [C ii] where the maximum ﬁlling factor is ∼ 9.
As noted in Section 4.3, considering that the opacity of [C ii] is
close to 0.1 at the [C ii] peak, 9 clouds on the line of sight will
add up to an opacity close to 1. As a consequence, the [C ii] in-
tensity will not add up linearly and this may call into question
our assumption of optically thin [C ii] at the [C ii] peak location.
Diﬀerent PDR viewing angles can also aﬀect this scenario and
the number of components we derive is an upper limit.

This spatial distribution of the ﬁlling factor reﬂects the
idea that the PDR clouds are smaller and/or less numerous
where the radiation ﬁeld is higher. The region mapped with
ALMA by Indebetouw et al. (2013) corresponds to the region
where the ﬁlling factor of PDRs is the largest in the map (see
Figure 16). The CO emission is highly structured, showing
dense (103–105 cm−3) clumps and ﬁlaments, on sub-parsecs
scales, covering approximately 10% of the area of the map.
They observed signiﬁcant photodissociation of CO by radiation
penetrating between the dense clumps, which can explain the
increased XCO factor determined for unresolved low metallicity
clouds. Indebetouw et al. measure an XCO factor two times the
solar-metallicity value in the dense CO clumps. This value can
be even higher when possible interclump H2 is included, for
unresolved studies.

5.2. Clouds geometry
Indebetouw et al. (2013) observed the giant molecular cloud
30Dor-10, north of R136 with ALMA during Cycle 0 (it in-
cludes our regions B and C from Figure 3). In the region mapped
with ALMA, they measure a maximum diameter of 1.2 pc for
the CO(2-1) clumps and a ﬁlling factor of about 10%. This
could mean that the CO luminosity is dominated by small, bright
clouds in the CO beam and the medium could be characterized
by clumps/ﬁlaments of low volume ﬁlling factor, with a physical
size much smaller than our pixel size, implying that a plane par-
allel geometry together with the high ﬁlling factor determined
with [C ii] may not be adapted to our observations.

Indeed, with the Amax

V , GUV and P previously determined in
Sections 4.4 and 4.3, we ﬁnd that several plane parallel clouds
are required to reproduce the observed absolute intensities. Each
of these clouds have a physical size between 0.2 and 3 pc, and
an internal CO layer (estimated where the CO abundance is at
least 50% of the maximum CO abundance) that ranges between
0.06 to 0.5 pc. The derived size scale is compatible with the
ALMA observations. These results however depend on two main
assumptions: the plane parallel geometry and the uniformity of
PDR clouds in each pixel.

With a plane geometry, the Amax

of the simulated clouds de-
termined here by comparison of the [C ii] and CO emissions can
be considered as a lower limit. Indeed, adopting a diﬀerent ge-
ometry by post-processing the results of the model and wrapping

V

Article number, page 14 of 20

the plane-parallel results on a spherical geometry will result in
a larger Amax
V . More details about this method can be found in
Appendix B. When assuming a spherical geometry, bathed in
an isotropic radiation ﬁeld, a higher AV (∼ 20 mag at the cen-
ter of the cloud) is needed to reproduce the CO observations.
Such extinction corresponds to spherical clouds with diameters
about four times larger than the size of the optimal plane par-
allel clouds. Nevertheless the results derived in Section 4.3 for
GUV and P are independent on the assumed geometry and remain
unchanged.

We note that the extinction parameter can be determined in-
dependently from the dust mass surface density, at a resolution
of 22" (Sect. 2.7). We can then compare Adust
derived from the
dust map to Amax
derived using the [C ii]/[C i] and [C ii]/CO ra-
tios in our PDR models (Sect. 4.4). On the one hand, Adust
V corre-
sponds to the integrated extinction along the line of sight in each
pixel. On the other hand Amax
V is calculated for individual clouds,
so for a meaningful comparison we need to scale by the num-
ber of components (i.e., the ﬁlling factor ΦA; Sect. 5.1). While
ΦA is calculated at a relatively high spatial resolution (12(cid:48)(cid:48)), the
Amax
for individual clouds is not well constrained due to the
poor spatial resolution (42(cid:48)(cid:48)) and coverage of the [C i] and CO
V
maps. In Figure 18, we plot Adust
as a function of ΦA (recal-
culated at a resolution of 22(cid:48)(cid:48)), with several tracks showing the
scaling with diﬀerent Amax
V values. There is a remarkable correla-
tion between Adust
V and ΦA, with most data points lying between
the Amax
= 1 and 3 lines, in agreement with the values deter-
mined with a plane-parallel geometry (Sect. 4.4). We emphasize
that the determinations of Amax
and ΦA are quite independent
V
from the determination of Adust
V , as the two quantities are derived
from diﬀerent physical processes, and constrained by diﬀerent
observational sets. From Figure 18, we infer that most clouds
values at a spatial resolution of 22(cid:48)(cid:48). More-
share similar Amax
over, the good agreement between Adust
(total extinction) and
Amax
V (derived in the neutral gas of PDRs) suggests that (1) there
is no signiﬁcant contribution from the ionized gas in the Adust
V
determination, and (2) there is no signiﬁcant contribution from
foreground/background gas not associated to 30Dor and not ac-
counted for by our PDR models. Our result not only strengthens
the Amax
range obtained in Section 4.4, but also suggests that
this range remains valid at a resolution of 22(cid:48)(cid:48). While this re-
sult seems to favor the plane-parallel geometry over the spheri-
cal geometry, we wish to stress that we cannot easily derive the
eﬀective extinction corresponding to spherical clouds observed
in any given pixel and that the large extinction probed at the cen-
ter of the spherical cloud is not representative of this eﬀective
extinction.

Finally, we discuss the possible existence of clumps em-
bedded in an interclump medium. Since the ﬁlling factor de-
termined with [C ii] in Section 5.1 may characterize an inter-
clump medium surrounding small CO clumps, it is possible that
the [C ii] and the CO emission are not associated with the same
structures. For example, a recent study of the N159 region by
Okada et al. (2015) ﬁnd that up to 50% of [C ii] cannot be as-
sociated with the CO emission based on the velocity proﬁles of
the lines. Testing the clumpiness of the medium would require
to adopt a distribution of clouds of diﬀerent sizes and pressures,
illuminated by a central source and including the eﬀect of scat-
tering and shielding, for each pixel of the map. Unfortunately,
such a scenario cannot be properly modeled yet due to the lack
of observational constraints.

5.3. 3D distribution of the gas
In this section we determine the physical distance between the
clouds and the ionizing sources to reconstruct the 3D distribution
of the gas. This is done by comparing the incident GUV, predicted
by the Meudon PDR code, and the emitted radiation ﬁeld, Gstars.
We deﬁne Gstars as the FUV radiation ﬁeld computed from the
known massive stellar population from the literature. We use cat-
alogs of stars from Crowther & Dessart (1998) and Selman &
Melnick (1999), including O and B stars and Wolf-Rayet (WF)
stars. We use the temperature of the brightest optical sources and
integrate over a blackbody between 912 and 2400 Å to be con-
sistent with the deﬁnition of GUV in the Meudon PDR code. We
1
R2 relation, where R is deﬁned as the physical dis-
then use a
tance from the center of the cluster, to calculate an average Gstars
in each pixel of a cube centered on R136. We ﬁrst make the as-
sumption that all of the stars lay on the same plane, and derive
the Gstars presented in Figure 19. Gstars is then the maximum in-
cident radiation ﬁeld we expect on each point of the cube since
no absorption is taken into account.

The ratios used to constrain GUV and P are independent of the
ﬁlling factor, since [O i] 145 µm, [C ii] and LPDR
FIR are supposed to
be almost co-spatial in the PDR model. Thus, GUV determined
with the model is also independent of the ﬁlling factor. In that
case, the incident radiation ﬁeld, GUV, should be equal to the

R136 plane, assuming there is no absorption between the ioniz-

here is an upper limit on the actual distance). We can determine
simultaneously four parameters : GUV, P, ΦA and z (the distance
to the plane of R136) for each pixel of the map, using the fol-
lowing relations :

intensity ratios j and M j the ratios calculated by the PDR model
(in erg s−1cm−2sr−1). GUV and Gstars are in units of the Mathis
ﬁeld. GUV and P are calculated as described in Section 4.3, us-
ing Equation 4.
The physical distance R between PDR clouds and R136 is
presented in Figure 20. It ranges from ∼ 11 to 80 pc. The gas
located close to R136 in the projected view is actually 40 to
80 pc away from the cluster. The bright arm-like structure in
[O iii], which, when projected, appears further from R136, is
much closer to the star cluster as it is almost on the same plane.
This is consistent with the distance calculated in Pellegrini et al.
(2011) for the ionized gas using optical observations.

The physical distance described above was derived by as-
suming that all of the stars are located in the same plane. For
comparison, we have also considered a random distribution of
the stars in the perpendicular direction, but maintaining a high
density of stars within a 6 pc radius around the center of R136
in order to reproduce a spherical distribution. We performed a
Monte-Carlo simulation and calculated distances similar to our
previous determination (< 40% diﬀerence throughout the map).
This is not surprising as most stars in R136 are in fact located in
a ∼ 6 pc radius sphere. We used the Monte-Carlo simulation to
estimate a typical uncertainty on the physical distance of ∼ 4 pc.

5.4. Porosity of the ISM

The [O iii] 88 µm line emission is detected over large spatial
scales in 30Dor, as it had been already noticed in other extended
sources (e.g. in N11 by Lebouteiller et al. 2012) and, together
with the small scale CO clumps we see, may be indicative of a
highly porous region. There is probably mixing of the ionized
and neutral phases of the ISM throughout all spatial scales. This
idea is supported by Figure 21, which shows the ratio [O iii]/[C ii]
as a function of ΦA. We can see that these two quantities are
strongly correlated. Indeed, a low area ﬁlling factor ΦA in a given
pixel implies a small volume fraction occupied by PDRs. This
means that there is less matter per unit volume to absorb the UV
radiation, and this radiation is able to travel further away. Re-
gion B from Figure 3 (violet), at ∼ 40 pc from R136, has the
lowest [O iii]/[C ii] ratio and the highest PDR ﬁlling factor. This
is also where the [C ii] peaks and the CO clumps reside (see con-

tours in Figure 16). In contrast, the ratio [O iii]/[C ii] is high (>
10) in region D (green), which is one of the furthest region from
R136, with a low ΦA. The blue points of region C, which is the
[O iii] peak and near the GUV and P peaks, show a large range
of [O iii]/[C ii] and ΦA. This is a region of widely varying ISM
conditions. Note that the ratio [O iii]/[C ii] as a function of the
physical distance R or GUV is a scatter plot, highlighting the fact
that the proximity of the ionizing source is not the only control-
ling factor of the structure of the ISM.
Over the mapped area of 42 pc × 56 pc the PDR ﬁlling fac-
tor and the [O iii]/[C ii] ratio vary over one order of magnitude.
The decrease in dust abundance and intense UV photons from
the SSC conspire together to shape the surrounding porous ISM,
ﬁlling it with hard photons and relatively small ﬁlling factor of
PDR clumps.

and 8 keV, given in unit of the Habing ﬁeld (Habing 1968). This is to be
compared with our results for GUV (see Section 5.5).

5.5. Other sources of excitation

No evidence of any shock tracers has been found in 30Dor for
now by previous studies (Indebetouw et al. 2009; Yeh et al.
2015). We investigate here the possibility for X-rays to be an
important source of excitation of the gas in 30Dor. Townsley
et al. (2006) have studied the population of X-ray point sources
(energy between 0.5 and 8 keV) in a 17(cid:48) × 17(cid:48) ﬁeld around R136
with Chandra. Spectral ﬁtting is performed on the brightest
sources (49 in total). In particular, they determine a total X-ray
luminosity, corrected for the absorption, of 1036.95 erg s−1 for the
brightest source in R136 (Mk 34), with an X-ray ﬂux of 2× 10−3
erg s−1cm−2sr−1 at a distance of 20 pc away, approximately at
the ionization front. As presented in Figure 22, such a low GX,
compared to the values of GUV, does not have an important
eﬀect on the intensity of the individual lines for a given GUV
and density.

5.6. If 30Dor were unresolved

Studying resolved nearby galaxies can help us understand more
distant unresolved targets. At a distance of 900 kpc, the entire
region of 30Dor mapped in [O i] 145 µm with PACS (covering
56 pc × 70 pc) would fall in only one spaxel of the PACS spec-
trometer. This distance is comparable to the distance of the An-
dromeda galaxy (∼780 kpc).

We integrate all of the tracers we have and perform the same
study at this lower resolution, with only one pixel. Using the
same technique as Section 4.3, we ﬁnd that all of the [C ii] emis-
sion originates from the PDRs. Using the Meudon PDR code, we
determine GUV = 1390, P = 6.18 × 105 cm−3 K and AV = 1 − 2.
This is representative of a region of moderate GUV and P in our
detailed spatial study such as region G in Figure 3 or the ISM
north of region B.

Even though our map is relatively small and centered on
R136, the global solution is already biased toward the solution
corresponding to regions with relatively low P and low GUV.
However, we have to keep in mind that the regions targeted with
PACS are the most luminous around R136, especially for the

[O i] 145 µm line. This implies that if we were to integrate an
even larger area, the result would be presumably biased even
more to this diﬀuse and low GUV regime. These two parameters
could be even lower if we include more diﬀuse regions, which is
the subject of a subsequent study in the LMC.

6. Conclusions
We have studied the ISM properties in the extreme environment
of 30Dor in the LMC, around the super star cluster R136. We
summarize our results as follow:

1. We have presented and analyzed new Herschel/PACS ob-
servations of 30Dor in [C ii] 158 µm, [O i] 63 and 145 µm,
[N ii] 122 and 205 µm and [O iii] 88 µm over a 56×70 pc re-
gion of 30Dor. All of these lines are well detected and pro-
vide diagnostics on the structure of the ISM.
The [O iii] line is the brightest of the FIR lines, ranging from
2 to 60 times more luminous than [C ii]. We propose that
the [O i] 63 µm line is optically thick throughout the mapped
region. We ﬁnd that the [C ii]/CO(1-0) luminosity ranges be-
tween 5 × 104 and 3 × 105 throughout the map. This range
is larger than the broad range of ratios found from integrated
DGS dwarf galaxies of Cormier et al. (2014).

2. Using the Spitzer and Herschel MIR to submm photometric
observations, we model the full dust SED spatially around
30Dor and derive the infrared luminosity map. We ﬁnd that
the [C ii] intensity ranges from 0.1 to 1% of the observed
LFIR throughout the region mapped.
3. Based on the electron density of the ionized gas (10 to 100
cm−3) and on the high value of the [C ii]/[N ii] ratio, we have
determined that at least 90% of the [C ii] emission originates
from the PDRs, which makes the [C ii] intensity a valuable
constraint for our PDR modeling.

4. We have decomposed the LFIR map to separate the compo-
nent associated with the ionized gas from the PDR-only com-
ponent. We ﬁnd, in places, that ∼ 70% of the LFIR is not from
PDRs, but associated with the ionized gas component, which
we remove for the PDR modeling. We emphasize caution
when applying the total LFIR to PDR models without consid-
ering the origin of the LFIR.

tribution of the radiation ﬁeld and the pressure with the
Meudon PDR code. GUV ranges between 102 and 3× 104 (in
units of the standard radiation ﬁeld deﬁned in Mathis et al.
1983) and P ranges between 105 and 1.7 × 106 cm−3 K.
6. The total depth of the clouds is determined by including the
ratios [C ii]/[C i] or [C ii]/CO in the modeling assuming that
all of these tracers are associated with the same structures.

value due to our assumption of a plane-parallel geometry.
7. We have conducted a 3D model of the PDR gas around R136.
Comparison of the incident radiation ﬁeld determined from
our PDR model, GUV, with the emitted radiation ﬁeld, Gstars,
reveals that the PDR gas is distributed at various distances
ranging between 20 to 80 pc from the excitation source,
R136.

8. The PDR area ﬁlling factor ranges between 0.6 (at the peak
of GUV) and 9 (at the peak of [C ii]). The high value of the
[O iii]/[C ii] ratio and its tight correlation with the ﬁlling fac-
tor rather than with the distance, highlight the porosity of the
ISM, ﬁlled with hard photons around relatively small PDR
clumps.

V

The combined eﬀects of a half-solar metallicity gas with the in-
tense excitation source R136 create the extreme environment we
see in 30Dor. It has been shown that the structure of the gas in
this region is dominated by photoionization. X-rays or shocks
are not needed to reproduce the observed line intensities. Based
on our ﬁndings in the present study, we speculate that the small
size of the CO core inside the PDR clouds could explain the
high [C ii]/CO ratio we observe in low metallicity environments.
The high value of the [O iii] emission line suggests that a highly
porous medium is a characteristic of the gas in low-metallicity
dwarf galaxies.

Appendix B: Spherical geometry
The Meudon PDR code is a plane parallel model. The code com-
putes the abundance proﬁles of the various species and excited
states in a plane parallel system as a function of the distance to
the surface of the cloud. It is possible to post-process the results
of a simulation to wrap the structure and simulate a spherical
cloud. To do that, we integrate the intensity of each transition
over a sphere, where the abundance proﬁles of each species as a
function of the distance to the surface of the sphere is equal to the
computed abundance proﬁle as a function of the distance to the
surface for a plane parallel geometry. The resulting line ratios as
a function of the diameter of the sphere, for an integrated cloud
illuminated by an isotropic ﬁeld, are shown in the right panel of
Figure B.1.

This is approach is geometrical. It is not done to accurately
model the physics of a spherical cloud but to investigate the im-
pact of the geometry on the integrated intensity, similar to the ap-
proach or Bolatto et al. (1999). Physically, this approach is only
valid when there is enough extinction, i.e. for values of AV (cid:38) 5.
In addition, we wish to emphasize that the approach of comput-
ing a spherical cloud by wrapping the structure is not satisfactory
in the case of clouds illuminated by a central stellar cluster since
the radiation ﬁeld seen by any cloud is not isotropic. The ideal
model would be a model with clouds of various sizes located at
various distances from a central radiation source.
