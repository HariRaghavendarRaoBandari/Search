Abstract

We extend the Noether theory of invariants to the Poincar´e equations. We apply this
extension to the Maxwell-Lorentz equations coupled to the Abraham rotating extended elec-
tron with the conﬁguration space SO(3).

Keywords: Poincar´e equations; conservation laws; Noether theory of invariants; Abra-
ham’s rotating extended electron; Maxwell-Lorentz equations; Hamilton’s least action prin-
ciple.

Introduction

For the Maxwell-Lorentz equations with a rotating charged particle (see Eqs. (2.3)-(2.6) below)
Hamilton’s least action principle is justiﬁed in [3]. The main contribution of [3] is variational
derivation of the Lorentz torque equation (2.6). While the equations (2.3)-(2.5) follow by stan-
dard Euler-Lagrange arguments, the Lorentz torque equation (2.6) follows by variational Poincar´e
equations [2, 6].

Our main result is a suitable generalization of the Noether theory of invariants to the Poincar´e
equations on the Lie groups. Moreover, we apply this generalization to a formal derivation of
conservation laws for the Maxwell-Lorentz equations with a rotating charged particle. We show
that the corresponding ”Poincar´e invariants” coincide with classical known expressions considered
in [4] where their conservation was shown by direct calculation.

We consider solutions for which all our formal diﬀerentiations and integration by parts hold

true.

2 Maxwell-Lorentz equations

The Maxwell ﬁelds E(x, t) and B(x, t) are generated by motion of a rotating charge. External
ﬁelds Eext and Bext are generated by the corresponding external charges and currents. Let the
rotating charge be centered at the position q with the velocity ˙q. For simplicity we assume that
the mass distribution, m ρ(x), and the charge distribution, e ρ(x), are proportional to each other.
Here m is the total mass, e is the total charge, and we use a system of units such that m = 1
and e = 1. The coupling function ρ(x) is a suﬃciently smooth radially symmetric function of fast
decay as |x| → ∞,

ρ(x) = ρr(|x|).

(C)

2.1 Angular velocity

Let us denote by ω(t) ∈ IR3 the angular velocity “in space” (in the terminology of [2]) of the
charge. Namely, let us ﬁx a “center” point O of the rigid body. Then the trajectory of each ﬁxed
point of the body is described by

x(t) = q(t) + R(t)(x(0) − q(0)),

where q(t) is the position of O at the time t, and R(t) ∈ SO(3). Respectively, the velocity reads

˙x(t) = ˙q(t) + ˙R(t)(x(0) − q(0)) = ˙q(t) + ˙R(t)R−1(t)(x(t) − q(t)) = ˙q(t) + ω(t) ∧ (x(t) − q(t)), (2.1)

where ω(t) ∈ IR3 corresponds to the skew-symmetric matrix ˙R(t)R−1(t) by the rule

˙R(t)R−1(t) = J ω(t) :=


0

ω3(t)
−ω2(t)

−ω3(t)

0

ω1(t)

We assume that x and q refer to a certain Euclidean coordinate system in IR3, and the vector prod-
uct ∧ is deﬁned in this system by standard formulas. The identiﬁcation (2.2) of a skew-symmetric
matrix and the corresponding angular velocity vector is true in any Euclidean coordinate system
of the same orientation as the initial one.

2.2 Dynamical equations

Then the system of Maxwell-Lorentz equations with spin reads, see [4, 7]

˙E = ∇ ∧ B − ( ˙q + ω ∧ (x − q))ρ(x − q)

(a) ,

˙B = −∇ ∧ E

(b) ,

∇ · E(x, t) = ρ(x − q(t))

(a) , ∇ · B(x, t) = 0

(b) ,

¨q =Z [E + Eext + ( ˙q + ω ∧ (x − q)) ∧ (B + Bext)]ρ(x − q) dx,

I ˙ω =Z (x − q) ∧ [E + Eext + ( ˙q + ω ∧ (x − q)) ∧ (B + Bext)]ρ(x − q) dx,

where I is the moment of inertia deﬁned by

I =

2

3Z x2ρ(x) dx.

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

Here the equations (2.3) are Maxwell equations with the corresponding charge density and current,
equations (2.4) are constraints. The back reaction of the ﬁeld onto the particle is given through the
Lorentz force equation (2.5), and the Lorentz torque equation (2.6) deals with rotational degrees
of freedom.

2.3 The variational Hamilton principle

Let us introduce electromagnetic potentials A = (A0, A), Aext = (Aext

0 , Aext):

B = ∇ ∧ A, E = −∇A0 − ˙A.

Bext = ∇ ∧ Aext, Eext = −∇Aext

0 − ˙Aext.

Next we deﬁne the Lagrangian

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

L(A, q, R,

˙A, ˙q, ˙R) =

1

2Z (cid:0)E2(x) − B2(x)(cid:1) dx +

−Z [A0(x) + Aext

0 (x)]ρ(x − q) dx +Z ( ˙q + ω ∧ (x − q)) · [A(x) + Aext(x)]ρ(x − q) dx,

where E(x) and B(x) are expressed in terms of A(x) and ˙A(x) according to (2.8), and ω =
J −1 ˙RR−1 by (2.2).

This Lagrangian functional depends on R only trough ω due to the spherical symmetry of the
charge and mass distributions (C). Respectively, the dynamical equations (2.3)–(2.6) involve R
only through ω as well. On the other hand, in the case of non-radial densities the Lagrangian
and the equations involve R explicitly, and the moment of inertia I becomes a matrix with x ⊗ x
instead of x2 in (2.7).

The corresponding action functional has the form

S = S(A, q, R) :=Z t2

t1

L(A(t), q(t), R(t),

˙A(t), ˙q(t), ˙R(t)) dt

(2.11)

Then the Hamilton’s least action principle reads

δS(A, q, R) = 0,

(2.12)

2

where the variation is taken over A(t), q(t), R(t) with the boundary conditions

(δA, δq, δR)|t=t1 = (δA, δq, δR)|t=t2 = 0.

(2.13)

Regular solutions and external potential. Everywhere below we consider regular solutions
to the system (2.3)–(2.6). This means that q ∈ C 2(IR, IR3), ω ∈ C 1(IR, IR3), and all the involved
functions and ﬁelds/potentials are suﬃciently smooth and have (with all the necessary derivatives)
a suﬃcient decay as |x| → ∞ so that the partial integrations below are allowed.

In [3, Theorem 2.1] we have shown that for regular solutions, the Maxwell-Lorentz system
(2.3)–(2.6) is equivalent to the least action principle (2.12)–(2.13) In detail, consider the variational
equations

(2.3) with the constraints (2.4), and the equation (2.15), (b) is equivalent to the Lorentz force
equation (2.5).

Note that the equations (2.14), (a), (b) are equivalent to standard Euler-Lagrange equations
˙A, q, and ˙q vary in the corresponding linear spaces. So, we will

(2.15) because the variables A,
call these variables the “Lagrange variables”.

On the other hand, R ∈ SO(3), and respectively, the variational equation (2.14) (c) cannot be
transformed to a Euler-Lagrange equation since SO(3) is not a linear space. We have shown in [3,
Theorem 2.1] that (2.14) (c) is equivalent to the Lorentz torque equation (2.6) using the variational
Poincar´e equations with the Lagrangian L expressed in suitable coordinates on T SO(3).
In detail, consider an orthonormal basis {ek} with the right orientation in IR3. Then

e1 ∧ e2 = e3, e2 ∧ e3 = e1, e3 ∧ e1 = e2.

(2.16)

Let us express the angular velocity in {ek}: ω(t) = P ωk(t)ek. The algebra so(3) of skew-

symmetric 3 × 3 matrices with the matrix commutator is isomorphic to the algebra IR3 with the
vector product, through the isomorphism J of (2.2):





 = J (ω1, ω2, ω3).

Namely, let A, B ∈ so(3), a, b ∈ IR3, and A = J a, B = J b. Then

˙R has the same coordinates w.r.t. the vector ﬁelds vk at the point R as ω in the

In [3, Lemma 6.1] it is shown that for the vector ﬁelds vk on SO(3) the following commutation

relations hold:

[v1, v2] = −v3,

[v2, v3] = −v1,

[v3, v1] = −v2.

(2.21)

We will identify vector ﬁelds with the corresponding opertors of diﬀerentiation. According to the
Poincar´e theory [2, 6], the equation (2.14) (c) is equivalent to the Poincar´e equations

˙A, ˙q, ω) is deﬁned as the right hand side of

ikvj(R).

In Appendix A, we recall the calculation of the Poincar´e equations (2.22). These calculations will
be used througough the paper.

Note that the Lagrangian ˆL does not depend explicitly on R, and hence vk( ˆL) = 0, k = 1, 2, 3.

We summarize the situation as follows, see [3]. The Lagrangian ˆL depends on two groups of
variables: on the “Lagrangian variables” A,
˙q and on the variables ωk which we will call
the “Poincar´e variables”. The variational equations (2.14) (a), (b) imply the Maxwell-Lorentz
equations (2.3)–(2.5), while (2.14) (c) give the Lorentz torque equations (2.6).

Invariants for the Poincar´e equations

When the external ﬁelds possess a symmetry with respect to the Lagrangian variables, the corre-
sponding conservation laws are given by the Noether theorem on invariants [1]. In this section we
extend the Noether theory to the Poincar´e equations.

Let v1(g), . . . , vn(g) be vector ﬁelds on an n-dimensional manifold M which are linearly inde-
pendent at each point g ∈ M. In particular such vector ﬁelds exist for any open region M ⊂ IRn.
Then T M is isomorphic to M × IRn, and any function L(g, ˙g) on T M can be expressed in the
Poincar´e variables g, ω:

ˆL(g, ω) := L(g, ˙g),

˙g =X ωkvk(g).

Remark 3.2 In the Lagrangian case (i.e., when M is a linear space and ω = ˙g), the invariant
(3.3) coincides with the standard energy functional.

Now let us consider general case of a one-parametric group of diﬀeomorphisms hs : M → M

(in particular, h0 = IdM ).

Deﬁnition 3.3 The Poincar´e invariant I and the corresponding ”current” w = (w1, ..., wn) are
deﬁned as

These deﬁnitions generalize the corresponding Noether formulas [1] to the case of Poincar´e equa-
tions.

Let the Lagrangian L be invariant with respect to the diﬀeomorphisms hs, i.e.

L(hsg, dhs ˙g) = L(g, ˙g),

(g, ˙g) ∈ T M,

s ∈ IR.

Theorem 3.4 Let condition (3.7) hold. Then the function I(g, ω) is conserved along the paths of
the Poincar´e equations (3.2).

Proof Let a smooth path (g(t), ω(t)) satisfy Poincar´e equations (3.2). Let us denote g(s, t) :=
hsg(t) and write

˙g(s, t) = dhs ˙g(t) =X ωk(s, t)vk(g(s, t)).

In particular, g(0, t) = g(t) and ˙g(t) :=P ωk(t)vk(g(t)). By (3.7), the quantity

ωk(s, t)vk(g(s, t))) = L(g(s, t), dhs ˙g(t))

ˆL(g(s, t), ω(s, t)) := L(g(s, t),Xk

does not depend on s; here ω(s, t) = (ω1(s, t), ..., ωn(s, t)). Denote by prime the derivative in s,
and by dot the derivative in t. Then we obtain

(3.9)

ijωi ˆLωk for s = 0. Namely, g(0, t) = g(t) together with

ω(0, t) = ω(t) satisfy the Poincar´e equations (3.2). Hence, for s = 0

S = ˆLg · g′ +Xk
Next we wish to evaluate the term Pik

vj( ˆL)wj =Xj

Invariants for the Lagrange-Poincar´e equations

Here we generalize the theory of the previous section to systems with the conﬁguration space
Y × M, where Y is a Hilbert space either of ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimension, while M is a ﬁnite-
dimensional manifold endowed with the vector ﬁelds vk(g) as above. Then T Y ≃ Y × Y and
T M ≃ M × IRn.

Let L(X, V, g, ˙g) be a diﬀerentiable Lagrangian which is deﬁned on T Y × T M. Let us deﬁne

ˆL(X, V, g, ω) := L(X, V, g, ˙g),

(4.1)

˙g =X ωkvk(g).

Let a smooth path (X(t), V (t)), g(t), ω(t) satisfy standard Euler-Lagrange equations w.r.t. the

5 Conservation laws for Maxwell-Lorentz equations

Lorentz equations with rotating charge. As above, we denote

ˆL(A, q,

˙A, ˙q, ω) = L(A, q, R,

˙A, ˙q, ˙R)

(5.1)

where ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) is deﬁned by (2.20), i.e., ωk are coordinates of
v3(R); recall that ˆL does not depend explicitly on R.

˙R in the basis v1(R), v2(R),

Let us note that L does not depend on ˙A0. By Theorem 4.1, we come formally to the following
statement:

k(A(x), q) = (A(x − sek), q + sek),

(5.4)

where ek ∈ IR3 is the corresponding basis vector. Since the group acts only on the Lagrange
coordinates X := (A, q), V := ( ˙A, ˙q), we may formally apply the Noether theory [1, 5] and obtain

Proof By (2.8) the transforms (5.7) of the potentials induce the following transforms of the ﬁelds:

E(x) 7→ UkE(U −1

k x), B(x) 7→ UkB(U −1

k x).

(5.10)

Further, we have, in operator notations, J ω = ω∧, where ω∧ is the operator of the vector product
k . Thus, for ω = J −1 ˙RR−1 we
by ω in IR3. Then it is easy to check that J (Ukω) = UkJ (ω)U −1
obtain J ω = ˙RR−1 and hence J (Ukω) = Uk( ˙RR−1)U −1

k = (Uk ˙R)(UkR)−1. Finally,

This means that the transforms (5.8) induce the following transform of ω:

Ukω = J −1(Uk ˙R)(UkR)−1.

Now it is easy to check, in view of axial symmetry of Aext, the invariance of L w.r.t. the transforms
(5.10), (5.9), (5.11), since ρ is spherically symmetric.

ω 7→ Ukω.

(5.11)

Recall that ˜ek is the image of the basis vector ek w.r.t. the isomorphism (2.17). By Lemma 5.4
the Lagrangian ˆL (5.1) is invariant w.r.t. the spatial rotations (5.9), (5.10), (5.11). In particular,
ˆL is invariant under the transform group hs

k = es˜ek ∈ SO(3).

In detail, we have the situation of previous section when ˆL depends on Lagrangian variables
˙A, ˙q) and on Poincar´e variables (R, ω). The action of this group on the state

(X, R) reads

6 Expressions for energy and momenta

Let us show that the Poincar´e invariants from previous section coincide with classical known
expressions considered in [4] (where their conservation was shown by direct calculation).

Proposition 6.1 The invariants for the Maxwell-Lorentz system (2.3)–(2.5) read as follows:

i) The energy reads

E =

Iω2 +Z Aext

0 (x)ρ(x − q) dx.

ii) The momentum reads

P = ˙q +Z E(x) ∧ B(x) dx +Z Aext(x)ρ(x − q) dx.

iii) The angular momentum reads

M = q ∧ ˙q + Iω +Z x ∧ E(x) ∧ B(x) dx +Z x ∧ Aext(x)ρ(x − q) dx.

Proof

E = ˆL ˙A ·

formula (6.4) reads (6.1).

Then

Pj = LV ·

= ˙qj +Z Ajρ(x − q) dx −Z (∇A0 + ˙A) · ∂jA dx +Z Aext

j ρ(x − q) dx

By partial integration

Z Aj(x)ρ(x − q) dx = Z Aj(∇ · E) dx =Z Aj∇ · (−∇A0 − ˙A) dx

= Z Aj(−∆A0 − ∇ ˙A) dx =Z (∇A0 · ∇Aj + ( ˙A · ∇)Aj) dx.

Hence,

Pj = ˙qj +Z (∇A0 · ∇Aj + ( ˙A · ∇)Aj) dx −Z (∇A0 · ∂jA + ˙A · ∂jA) dx +Z Aext

j ρ(x − q) dx. (6.7)

On the other hand, the j-th component of the RHS of (6.2) equals

˙qj +Z (E ∧ B)j dx +Z Aext

j ρ(x − q) dx.

Insert E = − ˙A − ∇A0, B = ∇ ∧ A and obtain

˙qj +Z Aext

j ρ(x − q) dx +Z (cid:16)( ˙A · ∇)Aj − ˙A · ∂jA + ∇A0 · ∇Aj − ∇A0 · ∂jA(cid:17) dx

which coincides with (6.7).

iii) For concreteness let us compute M1. Then

1(X) = (A0(e−s˜e1x), es˜e1A(e−s˜e1x), es˜e1q).
αs

One has

Further,

= (˜e1A0(x), ˜e1A(x) − (˜e1x · ∇)A(x), ˜e1q).

by deﬁnition (2.20) of the ﬁelds vk(R). Hence, for the currents w1

We have to prove that this expression equals to the ﬁrst component of the RHS of (6.3).

It

ρ(x − q) = ∇ · E = ∇ · (−∇A0 − ˙A), hence

suﬃces to prove that the last line (6.8) equals to the ﬁrst component ofZ x ∧ (E ∧ B) dx. Indeed,
Z (x2A3−x3A2)ρ(x−q) dx =Z (x2A3−x3A2)(−∇ ˙A−∇2A0) dx =Z ∇(x2A3−x3A2)( ˙A+∇A0) dx. (6.9)

Then the line (6.8) transforms to

Z (cid:16)∂1(x2A3 − x3A2)( ˙A1 + ∂1A0) + x2∂2A3( ˙A2 + ∂2A0) − x3∂3A2( ˙A3 + ∂3A0)(cid:17) dx
+Z (cid:16)(x3∂2 − x2∂3)A1( ˙A1 + ∂1A0) − x2∂3A2( ˙A2 + ∂2A0) + x3∂2A3( ˙A3 + ∂3A0)(cid:17) dx.

On the other hand, substitute E = − ˙A − ∇A0, B = ∇ ∧ A and obtain that the ﬁrst component

(6.10)

of Z x ∧ (E ∧ B) dx equals

Z x2((∂1A3 − ∂3A1)( ˙A1 + ∂1A0) + (∂2A3 − ∂3A2)( ˙A2 + ∂2A0)) dx
−Z x3((∂3A2 − ∂2A3)( ˙A3 + ∂3A0) + (∂1A2 − ∂2A1)( ˙A1 + ∂1A0)) dx

which coincides with (6.10). The proof is complete.

A Poincar´e equations

Poincar´e suggested the form of the Hamilton least action principle for Lagrangian systems on
manifolds [6]. We present the derivation of the Poincar´e equations [2] since we use some of
intermediate calculations.

Let v1, . . . , vn be vector ﬁelds on a n-dimensional manifold M which are linearly independent

at every point g ∈ M. Then the commutation relations hold,

where the commutator [vi, vj] is deﬁned by

[vi, vj](g) =X ck

ij(g)vk(g),

g ∈ M

[vi, vj](f ) := vi(vj(f )) − vj(vi(f )),

and v(f ) is the derivative of a smooth function f on M w.r.t. the vector ﬁeld v. Note that by the
skew-symmetry property of the commutators one has

ij(g) = −ck
ck

ji(g), ∀ k = 1, ..., n.

(A.1)

If g(t) is a smooth path in M and f is a smooth function on M, one has ˙g(t) = P ωi(t)vi(g(t))

and

f (g(t)) = f ′(g(t)) · ˙g = f ′(g(t)) ·X ωi(t)vi(g(t)) =X vi(f )ωi(t).

Now consider a variation g(s, t) of the path g(t). Then similarly,

d
dt

vj(f )wj(s, t),

∂sf (g(s, t)) =Xj

12

where wj(s, t) are coordinates of ∂g

∂s (s, t) ∈ Tg(s,t)M. Hence

∂s∂tf (g(s, t)) =Xi Xj
∂t∂sf (g(s, t)) =Xj Xi

vj(vi(f ))wjωi +Xi
vi(vj(f ))wjωi +Xj

vi(f )ω′

vj(f ) ˙wj,

where the prime respectively the dot stand for the diﬀerentiation in s respectively in t. However,
the diﬀerentiations in t and s commute, hence we obtain by subtraction

vk(f )ω′

Xk

ijωiwjvk(f ) +Xk

vk(f ) ˙wk.

Since f is an arbitrary smooth function, we come to the relations

ck
ijωiwj + ˙wk.

(A.2)

k =Xk Xij
k(s, t) =Xij

ω′

Further, let us consider a Lagrangian function L(g, ˙g) on T M. Then L(g, ˙g) can be expressed
in the variables ω: L(g, ˙g) = ˆL(g, ω). Let us compute the variation of the corresponding action
functional taking (A.2) into account:

The variation should be zero by the Hamilton least action principle, under the boundary value

conditions

Since wk(t1) = wk(t2) = 0 by (A.3), we obtain the following Poincar´e equations:

g(s, t1) = g1, g(s, t2) = g2.

Remarks 1. If g is expressed in a local map as (g1, ..., gn) ∈ IRn, and vk = ∂gk, then (A.4) reduce
to the standard Euler-Lagrange equations.
2. If a Lagrangian L does not depend on g, then ˆL = ˆL(ω) and one has

Indeed, vk( ˆL) = ∇g ˆL · vk(g) = 0.
3. Suppose M = G is a Lie group, and let vk, k = 1, ..., n be independent either left-invariant or
right-invariant vector ﬁelds on G. Then ck

ij(g) are constant:

vk( ˆL) = 0.
