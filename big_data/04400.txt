Abstract

Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, with their extreme properties, defy our current knowledge of active
galactic nuclei and relativistic jet systems. They excite, and might help us answer, many questions concern-
ing the evolution and uniﬁcation of AGN, but still remain a poorly studied class of AGN as such.

We did an extensive study of a large sample of NLS1s using various statistical methods, for example,
multiwavelength correlations and principal component analysis. We wanted to examine how and where in
NLS1s diﬀerent kinds of radiation are produced, and how the emission properties are connected to other
intrinsic AGN properties. In addition we present the early results of our ongoing research about the large-
scale environments of NLS1s. We also introduce the Mets¨ahovi Radio Observatory NLS1 survey and its
ﬁrst results, and show some early results for individual sources.

Introduction

The presence of powerful relativistic jets in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) was conﬁrmed when Fermi
detected gamma-rays from a handful of them. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm powerful
relativistic jets are produced only in massive elliptical galaxies with supermassive black holes, but NLS1s
challenge this scenario since they have lower black hole masses, higher accretion rates, preferably compact
radio morphology and they reside mostly in spiral galaxies.

Due to Fermi’s discovery the AGN uniﬁcation schemes have to be revised to ﬁt in NLS1s, the third gamma-
ray emitting AGN class. It also invokes questions about the AGN evolution; what triggers and maintains the
AGN activity, and what are the evolutionary lines of the diﬀerent populations? NLS1s complicate the whole
AGN scenario, but also oﬀer a new perspective at the jet phenomena at a diﬀerent scale.

NLS1s are a poorly studied class of AGN. It seems that a surprisingly large fraction of them are radio-
loud and thus possibly host jets; but also some of them seem to be totally radio-silent. This, as well as other
observational evidence, implies that they do not form a homogeneous class. However, we are not certain
what is the origin of the radio loudness, but, for example, the properties of the host galaxy and the large-scale
environment might play a role.

To get more insight into the emission and other intrinsic properties of NLS1s we performed a multivariable
study of a large sample of NLS1s. This study is reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3 we discuss the ongoing
study of the large-scale environments of NLS1s, and in Section 4 we present the Mets¨ahovi NLS1 survey.
Finally, in Section 5 we summarise the results and the ongoing research.

2 Multivariable study of NLS1s

2.1 Sample and data

We did an extensive statistical study of a large sample of NLS1s [14] in which our aim was to estimate via
which processes and where the various kinds of emission are produced in them. We did this by compiling

multiwavelength and spectral data from literature for a sample of NLS1s. With this data set we explored
the connections between diﬀerent wavebands, and spectral and other intrinsic AGN properties using various
correlation analyses, for example, Pearson’s product-moment and Spearman’s rank correlations, and principal
component analysis.

Using three references [22, 24, 15] we selected sources which had radio data from the Very Large Array
(VLA) Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey. Our ﬁnal sample consists of 292
NLS1s. All the data were gathered from publicly available archival sources, and thus are not simultaneous.
Since NLS1s are generally variable multiwavelength studies should ideally be performed with simultaneous
data, but observations of NLS1s are too scarce to do this.

Radio data from FIRST, optical data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and X-ray data from ROSAT
All Sky Survey (RASS) were retrieved from ASDC1. We have radio and optical data for all sources, and X-ray
data for 109 sources. Infrared (IR) data from Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky Source
Catalog [5] were retrieved from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA2) and we have it for 282
sources.

2.2 Radio loudness

We computed radio loudness (RL) values using the commonly deﬁned RL value; the ratio of 1.4 GHz radio ﬂux
density (FR) and 440 nm optical ﬂux density (FO). We used the K-corrected [10] radio ﬂux densities from the
FIRST survey and K-corrected B-band optical ﬂux density calculated using SDSS u- and g-band magnitudes.
The radio loudness value distribution of our sample is shown in Figure 1. We divided our sample to subsamples
by radio loudness; 195 sources with RL > 10 form the radio-loud (RL) subsample, and 97 sources with RL <
10 the radio-quiet (RQ) subsample.

2.3 Black hole mass

Black hole masses were estimated using the FWHM(Hβ) – L5100 (the monochromatic luminosity at 5100Å)
mass scaling relation [12]. This method does not take into account possible orientation eﬀects caused by the
geometry of the broad-line region of the source and the viewing angle [6], but methods based on σ∗ or Lbulge
can not be used due to the lack of data.

We were able to estimate the MBH for 275 sources. The MBH distributions for RQ and RL subsamples are
shown in Figure 2. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for MBH suggests that the RQ and RL subsamples are
not drawn from the same distribution (p=2.04×10−4). On average RL sources have more massive black holes
than RQ sources.

2.4 Multiwavelength correlations

We calculated multiwavelength correlations using both, ﬂux densities and luminosities. The used methods were
Pearson’s product-moment and Spearman’s rank correlations – normal, and partial, with z as the third variable.
We calculated the correlations separately for RQ and RL subsamples. Results from all the correlations were
consistent with each other.

The correlations suggest that in RL sources the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emissions
are the relativistic jets. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear, but it is probably a mixture of both,
thermal and non-thermal, processes. RQ sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. Radio and IR emission
in them is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray emission originate in
the inner parts of the AGN.

2.5 Principal component analysis

Principal component analysis is a statistical method which can be used to determine which properties cause
most of the variability in a data set. We performed PCA with multiwavelength data, MBH, R4570, and
FWHM(Hβ). Eigenvector 1 accounts for 34% – 37% of the variance and distinguished between the MBH,
and the brightness at IR and optical. X-ray emission is connected to IR and optical but contributes less. Radio
emission is rather insigniﬁcant except in the RQ subsample where it is connected with IR and optical, con-
ﬁrming the suggestion of its stellar origin in these sources. The prominence of MBH implies that EV1 might
be similar to EV2 in [13]. Eigenvector 2 is responsible for 19%-24% of the variance and clearly distinguishes
between R4570 and FWHM(Hβ) in all samples. IR and optical seem to be connected to FWHM(Hβ) to some
extent. EV2, dominated by the anticorrelation of R4570 and FWHM(Hβ), is similar to the traditional EV1
[2, 3, 23].

Eigenvectors in our study seem to be reversed compared to previous studies, but as pointed out in [13], each
sample has its own eigenvectors that depend on the variables used and their range. Our results can be explained
taking into account that AGN form a continuum in which the properties change from one class to another, as
well as inside a class, and that our study is the ﬁrst one using a pure NLS1 sample. When using mixed samples
the properties that change from one source type to another create the EV1, which is transformed to a sequence
of properties within a pure sample but in a less signiﬁcant role (EV2 of our NLS1 sample). EV1 of our NLS1
sample describes the properties that cause most of the diﬀerences within that source type only. Previous studies
have mostly used only optical data, thus for consistency, we tested our analysis by performing it with optical
data only. This, however, did not change our results.

3 Large-scale environment

Host galaxy and close-by and large-scale environment studies of NLS1s will improve our knowledge of the
properties of them as a class, as well as their evolution and the AGN uniﬁcation in general. Interesting questions
are, for example, whether NLS1s are diﬀerent to broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1) in host or environmental
properties, and are Type 1 and Type 2 AGN similar or not.

The diﬀerences between the host galaxies of NLS1s and other types of Seyfert galaxies (BLS1s, Sy2s) are
prominent. Both, NLS1s and BLS1s are preferably hosted by disk-like galaxies, but in NLS1s the incidence
of bars is higher, they exhibit more star formation [4, 7, 19, 21] and are less likely to be merging/interacting
[19]. The absence of interaction suggests that the growth and evolution of NLS1s has been and is dominated
by secular processes [20] and the evolutionary path diﬀers from that of other Seyferts.

Environmental studies point to Sy1s and Sy2s residing in diﬀerent environments; Sy2s have more close
companions, but reside in less dense large-scale environments and are generally of later type, whereas Sy1s
have less close companions, reside in denser large-scale environments and are more evolved [8, 17, 16]. [17]
and [9] did not ﬁnd diﬀerences between the environments of NLS1s and Sy1s, but [17] found that compared
to non-active galaxies with similar properties NLS1s have fewer companions and are farther away from them
than non-active galaxies. They also found that NLS1 host galaxies are smaller than hosts of Seyfert 1 or normal
galaxies.

[18] used SDSS DR7 to construct a luminosity density ﬁeld of luminous red galaxies to study the large-scale
environments of diﬀerent AGN classes. They conclude that Sy1s and Sy2s reside in diﬀerent environments. We
used their density ﬁeld data to study the large-scale environments of NLS1s; we have density ﬁeld data for 960
sources with z < 0.4. We are interested in the environmental distribution of NLS1s, and whether it is diﬀerent
compared to other types of AGN. Table 1 shows average densities for NLS1 subsamples and the fraction of
sources in voids, ﬁlaments and superclusters. Other types of sources from [18] are listed for comparison. We
use the same deﬁnition for voids, ﬁlaments and clusters as in [18]; in void density < 1.0, in ﬁlament 1.0 <
density < 3.0 and in supercluster density > 3.0.

Based on the preliminary results the average density seems to increase with increasing RL and the en-
vironmental distribution of sources seems to change with RL. However, K-S test suggests that the density
distributions of our subsamples are similar. The average density for our whole sample is smaller than for any
sample in [18], and the distribution to density bins is clearly diﬀerent. There seems to be more NLS1s than
Sy1s or Sy2s in voids, less in ﬁlaments and roughly the same fraction in superclusters. These results, along
with a more extensive multivariable study with a bigger sample of NLS1s will be published in the near future.

4 Radio observations of NLS1s

Radio observations are crucial for understanding the relativistic jet phenomena since the properties of the rel-
ativistic jets are somewhat directly connected to the radio emission properties in radio-loud AGN – also in
NLS1s. So far, NLS1s have been very scarcely observed at any, especially higher, radio frequencies. A few
monitoring programs are targeting NLS1s (e.g. F-GAMMA3), but they mainly concentrate on the brightest
individuals. To properly study NLS1s as a class we need observations of bigger and more diverse samples.

4.1 Mets¨ahovi pilot survey

To amend the lack of radio observations we have launched an extensive observing program of NLS1s at 22
and 37 GHz at the Mets¨ahovi Radio Observatory, Kirkkonummi, Finland, where a 14m radio telescope is used
for monitoring large samples of AGN frequently. At the moment we have four NLS1 samples totaling up to
145 sources chosen based on gamma-ray detections, radio-loudness, large-scale environment, and brightness
on optical, IR or X-rays. Monitoring of the NLS1 sample 1 started in February, 2012, of the sample 2 in
November, 2013, and of the samples 3 and 4 in March, 2014, and are still ongoing. Four NLS1s (1H 0323+342,
SDSS 084957.97+510829.0, SDSS J094857.31+002225.4 and SDSS J150506.47+032630.8) were monitored
already earlier, thus we have observations spanning much longer times for them. We aim to have at least three
observations of each source separated by several months to see if they are at all detectable at 37 GHz and to
examine the possible variability. For Mets¨ahovi observations we use S/N > 4 as a detection limit. By the end of
April, 2015, we had fulﬁlled this criterion for every source in samples 1 and 2. We were able to detect 15 of 78
sources (19.2%), of which, unfortunately, seven sources only once. This might indicate that their ﬂux densities
are at our detection limit and/or that they are variable.

4.2 Additional radio data

In addition to Mets¨ahovi data we have radio data from RATAN-600 and Owens Valley Radio Observatory.

RATAN-6004 is a radio telescope with a diameter of 576 m operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences.
It is situated in The Special Astrophysical Observatory in Bolshoi Zelenchuk Valley of the Greater Caucasus
in Russia. We have data from RATAN-600 for 29 NLS1s at frequencies 4.8, 7.7, 8.2, 11.2 and 21.7 GHz. The
observations were made during October, 2013, and March-April, 2014.

40m5 radio telescope based in the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), California, USA, is used for
monitoring a sample of AGN weekly. We have OVRO data at 15 GHz for 15 NLS1s between January, 2008
and the end of April, 2015. For OVRO observations we used S/N > 4 as a detection limit.

Also Planck6 data, between frequencies 30 and 857 GHz, for some NLS1s will be available in the future.

4.3 Early results

Data for SDSS J084957.97+510829.0 is shown in Figure 3. Mets¨ahovi light curve at 37 GHz is shown in the
left panel (black circles are detections and red circles are non-detections). This is the longest light curve we
have for any NLS1 and it can be clearly seen that this source is variable. Radio spectrum with the archival
(black) and new data (OVRO – green, Mets¨ahovi – red) is in the middle panel and implies that this source has
a ﬂat, somewhat variable, radio spectrum. The source is distinctly variable at 15 GHz OVRO light curve (right
panel, showing only detections).

Figure 4 shows the data for SDSS J150506.47+032630.8. Left panel shows the 37 GHz Mets¨ahovi light
curve (detections in black and non-detections in red) which indicates that the source is variable. The middle
panel shows the radio spectrum (archival data – black, RATAN-600 – magenta, OVRO – green, Mets¨ahovi –
red), which seems to be ﬂat and, to some extent, variable. The OVRO light curve at 15 GHz (only detections)
in the right panel exhibits rather high amplitude variability.

Data and results for the whole pilot survey – samples 1 and 2 – will be published later this year.

5 Conclusions

Multivariable studies shed some light on the diﬀerent emission mechanisms acting in RQ and RL NLS1s, but
left some questions, for example, the origin of the IR emission, unanswered. More detailed studies on this
matter are needed to distinguish the contribution of star formation and AGN related emission processes in
NLS1s, and to establish the results at other wavebands.

Information about the large-scale environment of NLS1s and related AGN classes oﬀers us a new tool to
study the evolution and uniﬁcation of AGN, and combined with additional data helps us clarify the properties

of NLS1s as a class. For example, the knowledge whether NLS1s are a homogeneous class eﬀects how we
interpret them and how they should be treated in the grand AGN scenario to eﬀectively use them in studying
the jet and AGN phenomena.

To properly address the issues concerning NLS1s additional observations of large, diverse samples at vari-
ous wavebands are needed. Mets¨ahovi NLS1 survey, being the ﬁrst survey dedicated to systematical observa-
tions of NLS1s at high radio frequencies, will provide us with invaluable new information about this interesting
and unique class of AGN.
