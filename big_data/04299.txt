Abstract

Autocatalytic reaction fronts between two reacting species in the absence of ﬂuid ﬂow, propagate as

solitary waves. The coupling between autocatalytic reaction front and forced hydrodynamic ﬂow may

lead to stationary front whose velocity and shape depend on the underlying ﬂow ﬁeld. We focus on the

issue of the chemo-hydrodynamic coupling between forced advection opposed to self-sustained chemical

waves which can lead to static stationary fronts, i.e Frozen Fronts, F F . Towards that purpose, we

perform experiments, analytical computations and numerical simulations with the autocatalytic Iodate

Arsenious Acid reaction (IAA) over a wide range of ﬂow velocities around a solid disk. For the same

set of control parameters, we observe two types of frozen fronts: an upstream F F which avoid the solid

disk and a downstream F F with two symmetric branches emerging from the solid disk surface. We

delineate the range over which we do observe these Frozen Fronts. We also address the relevance of

the so-called eikonal, thin front limit to describe the observed fronts and select the frozen front shapes.

Introduction

Depending on the reaction kinetics, chemical reaction fronts exhibit fascinating phenomena

such as Turing patterns, Belousov-Zhabotinsky oscillations, and chaotic or solitary wave propa-

gation [1]. Autocatalytic reactions lead to fronts propagating as solitary waves with a constant

velocity and invariant, ﬂat, concentration proﬁle resulting from a balance between reaction

and diﬀusion [1–3]. These fronts are analogous to ﬂames in combustion [4] and autocatalytic

reactions are a kind of ”cold combustion model” especially in the thin ﬂame limit.

In contrast

to ﬂame propagation in combustion [4], where it has been analyzed thoroughly theoretically and

experimentally, the eﬀect of ﬂuid ﬂow (laminar or turbulent) on reaction fronts has not been

explored in detail until recently [5–18]. In the presence of an hydrodynamic ﬂow, it has already

been observed and understood that such fronts while propagating at a new constant velocity,

adapt their shape in order to achieve a balance between reaction diﬀusion and ﬂow advection.

More recently, the focus has been on the situation where the ﬂow ﬁeld acted against the chemical

reaction. In such a case, it has been observed over a wide range of ﬂow velocity that the fronts are

neither propagating forward (in the chemical reaction direction) nor blown in the ﬂow direction

but remains static, frozen.

In this dynamical equilibrium, chemistry and ﬂow are both at work.

For instance in porous media [18], the front is pinned around the stagnation zones of the ﬂow,

due to the porous structure, and the front is distorted, curved in order to accommodate the local

ﬂow velocity ﬂuctuations. In cellular ﬂows,the frozen fronts are pinned in vortex structure [13, 19].

To visualize the frozen fronts (F F ) , we designed an experiment with the Iodate Arsenous

Acid (IAA) chemical reaction in a simple heterogeneous forced ﬂow ﬁeld, namely a constant ﬂow

around a single disk-obstacle, opposed to the natural autocatalytic reaction front propagation.

Depending on the control parameters we do observe two types of F F : one upstream F F s

which avoid the solid disk and one downstream F F s with two symmetric branches emerging

from the solid disk surface. We delineate the range over which we do observe these Frozen

Fronts. Numerical simulations provide a systematic phase diagram of the Frozen Fronts. Using

2

the so-called eikonal limit of thin front thickness, we are able to account for the selection rule of

the Frozen Fronts.

I. EXPERIMENTS

We performed experiments with the Iodate Arsenous Acid (IAA) autocatalytic reaction:

3H3AsO3 + IO−

3 + 5I− −→ 3H3AsO4 + 6I−

(1)

The reaction is autocatalytic in iodide (I−). The concentrations used are:

[IO−

3 ]0 = 7.5 mM,

[H3AsO3]0 = 25 mM. As the ratio, [H3AsO3]0/[IO−

3 ]0 > 3, the Arsenous is in excess [20] and

the front can be localized by the transient iodine generated during the reaction. Instead of the

usual method using starch to detect the transient iodine, we use Polyvinyl alcohol (P V A) at a

concentration of 6 kg/m3 which is much more sensitive [21] and also gives a good optical contrast

(Figs. 4 and 8).

In addition, we add to the ﬂuids bromocresol green P H sensitive dye which

gives the position of the leading edge of the reaction front:

its color is blue for reactants and

yellow for products. In some experiments we only use the later front detection (Fig. 1).

This autocatalytic reaction in the ﬂuid ﬂow of local velocity ~U is govern by the convection(or

advection)-reaction-diﬀusion equation which can be written as:

(2)

where the speciﬁc kinetics of the IAA reaction is third order [20]: f (C) = C 2(1 − C). C is the

concentration of the autocatalytic reactant (iodide), normalized by the initial concentration of

iodate (C = [I−]/[IO−

3 ]0), τ the reaction time and Dm the molecular diﬀusion. In the absence of

ﬂow, U = 0 m/s, the balance between diﬀusion and reaction leads to a solitary wave of constant

velocity Vχ and width lχ [1, 20, 22], solutions of Eq. (2) given by:

Vχ = rDm

lχ = Dm/Vχ ,

C = (cid:18)1 + exp −(

)(cid:19)−1

(3)

where x is the propagation direction of the wave. With the above concentration, we measure

Vχ = (11 ± 1) µm/s, from which we can infer the reaction front width, lχ ≃ 200 µm. To achieve

reactant is injected from left to right at a ﬂow at constant velocity U0. The solid disk obstacle is a

cylinder of diameter 17mm. The chemical front in the absence of ﬂow would propagate from right

to left at a velocity Vχ. Left pictures : the two frozen fronts observable for the same ﬂow velocity

a quasi-2D velocity ﬁeld we use a Hele-Shaw cell [23], two thick rigid transparent parallel plates

separated by a small gap (250 µm). The solid circular disk of diameter 2R = 17mm is a joint

quenched between the two plates. The uniform ﬂow rates is achieved by two pumps, one for each

inlet (far upstream from the disk), and three outlets. The 2D ﬂow ﬁeld around the disk in a

uniform far ﬁeld in a Hele-Shaw is well known: at leading order it is the potential ﬂow of a uniform

ﬂow around an hydrodynamic dipole [24] which intensity is linked to R. For a viscous ﬂow the

4

velocity must be zero on the boundary, therefore there are boundary layer type corrections which

extend over a typical size of the order of the gap thickness which is analytically ﬁtted [25]. It is

worth noting already that we have also performed experiments around an hydrodynamic dipole

where we inject and suck product at the same ﬂow rate between two inlet outlet distant of 5 mm

(see Fig. 4) and around an injected air bubble (Fig 8).

II. TWO TYPES OF FROZEN FRONT IN UNIFORM FLOW PAST A SOLID

DISK

We have performed a series of experiments for diﬀerent ﬂow rate U0 opposed to the chemical

wave without ﬂow. Let us call u = |U0/Vχ| the control parameter of the experiment.

In the

experimental procedure, we ﬁrst initiate the front and let it propagate for a while; then at chosen

time we switch on the two pumps to generate an uniform ﬂow. For u < 1, fronts propagate

always to the left and never stop, there is no frozen front. For u > 1, after a transient, Frozen,

static fronts built on : Fig. 1 is a plot of such frozen fronts. For the same u, we did observe two

diﬀerent types of Frozen fronts depending on the switching time: for initial front generated on the

left of the disk, the ”upstream” F F keeps to avoid touching the disk surface. When the initial

front is in contact with the disk, the front keep this contact later on leading to a ”downstream”

F F with two symmetric branches.

In Fig. 1 we see that increasing u result for the upstream

front to be closer to the solid , whereas for the downstream one, the two branches of the front

are closer to the symmetry axis.

For both front types, for u (cid:23) 5 − 6, the front can not keep a stationary shape and hence no

frozen fronts are observed. For upstream front, the forming fronts comes so close to the left of

the solid disk that it comes into contact with it and then is transported by the ﬂow to the right.

For downstream fronts, the separation between the two branches becomes thinner and thinner as

u increases and can lead to a pinch-oﬀ, followed by a detachment as observed in [17].

III. FROZEN FRONT SELECTION USING THE EIKONAL EQUATION

As lχ ≃ 200 µm is rather small compared to the disk size (2R = 17 mm) and as the

experimental front is reduced to a single iso-concentration (in some instance we have been able

to get two iso-concentrations as in Figs. 4 and 8), it is tempting to describe this constant

concentration line in the framework of the eikonal thin front approximation. When the front

width lχ is much smaller than the typical size of the system (disk radius) the so called eikonal

account accurately of the front behavior [6, 9].

It also corresponds to the thin ﬂame regime in

combustion. In such regime Eq. 2 is replaced by the front evolution :

d−→r
dt

= ~VF = ~U + Vχ(1 + lχκ) · ~n

~VF · ~n = ~U · ~n + Vχ + Dmκ

(4)

(5)

where ~U is the local ﬂuid velocity at the front position −→r , ~n is the local unit vector normal

to the interface (oriented from product to reactant) and κ is the curvature of the interface.

As lχ is assumed small, the eikonal equation is usually used neglecting the last curvature term

[16].

Indeed this assumption is a little inconsistent as it discard the molecular diﬀusion which

is part of the reaction diﬀusion process (see Eq. 3). Moreover from the mathematical point of

view, it let the front curvature undetermined as it will be discussed later on.

We will use for the velocity ﬁeld the 2D velocity ﬁeld around a solid obstacle that will be used

in the following numerical simulations. We also address in this section only the class of upstream

fronts that avoid the solid obstacle.

The top left ﬁgure in Fig. 2 shows the dynamics of the formation of the frozen front at

diﬀerent time steps for u = 1.5 and lχ/R = 0.1. This dynamic is obtained by a step by step

direct integration of the full Eq. 4 with a ﬂat front far away upstream the disk as the initial

condition. Obviously, the front achieved an asymptotic Frozen Front. The top right of the same

ﬁgure shows the asymptotic frozen front, h(y) (where y is perpendicular to the symmetry axis,

x), for diﬀerent values of lχ: the selected frozen front deﬁnitively depends also on the chemical

corresponding data of h0 versus lχ are the squares in the bottom of Fig. 2. On the same ﬁgure

(u,lχ/R) the asymptotic F F s obtained from the dynamics Eq. 4 have a characteristic shape which

can be characterized by the position on the axis h(0) and the curvature h′′(0) for instance. How

the eikonal front. With this chosen axis orientation, in Figs 1 and 2 the curvature h′′(0) is

positive and hence reduces the eﬀective chemical velocity on the symmetry axis by a factor:
1 − lχh′′(0)/ (h′(0)2 + 1)3/2.

Eq. 6 is a second order diﬀerential equation for h(y) which integration requires two conditions.

Lets us start the integration from the point on the x axis, (h(0), 0). Owing to the symmetry of the

problem, we have h′(0) = 0. Inserting the later in Eq. 6 leads to −vx(h(0), 0) + 1 − lχh′′(0) = 0
: for each curvature h′′(0) on the symmetry axis, there is at least one value of h(0) that fulﬁll

Eq. 6, therefore there is no obvious selection of the Frozen Front. Note that if we take the h(0)

value obtained from the asymptotic frozen front obtained from the dynamics, we do recover the

same frozen front integrating Eq. 6 with the two conditions (h(0),h′(0)). To address the issue

of the selection of h(0) let us make the Taylor expansion of the static eikonal equation in the

vicinity of the apex of the frozen front (y ≃ 0) for the variables involved in Eq. 6 namely

ity (∂xvx + ∂yvy = 0). Injecting these expansions in Eq. 6 leads to :

With such an expansion, solving Eq. 6 can be achieved by equating to zero the coeﬃcients of

the values obtained through this procedure converge to the same values. On the bottom of Fig.

2, where the measured values of |h0| and h′′

0 on the asymptotic frozen fronts are plotted versus
lχ/R, the solid curves correspond to the second order approximation; note that the fourth order

is completely indistinguishable of these curves from the second one. The agreement is rather

good, validating our procedure to account for the selection of the frozen fronts. Moreover the

two plateaus observed as lχ → 0 in the Log-linear plot at the bottom of the same Fig. 2 clearly

shows that both h(0) and h′′(0) tend to ﬁnite values which are the full eikonal limit ones h(0)lχ

→0

and h′′(0)lχ

→0.

9

This allows us to revisit the ”classical” use of the eikonal equation [16] which neglects the

last term in Eq.5 : indeed setting lχ = 0 in Eq.5 does not mean that there is no front curvature

but that the leading zero order, −vx(h0, 0) + 1 = 0, gives only the front position, hlχ=0(0) which

is the same as the one we get h(0)lχ

→0. The second order, Eq. 11, with hlχ=0(0) and lχ = 0

leads to h′′

lχ=0(0) etc. Therefore our selection procedure gives at the second order the required
curvature, leading to a complete selection of the frozen front which is, as veriﬁed, identical to
the direct integration of ~U · ~n + Vχ = 0.

In the same papers [16], a clever construction of the

allowed fronts is described. In the full eikonal limit (lχ = 0), the front is initiated at the boundary

of slow zones and is not allowed to penetrate them. These slow zones correspond to |

−→
U | ≤ Vχ.

In Fig. 3, we have drawn the slow zone around the solid disk (red) and the full eikonal frozen

front (lχ = 0) corresponds to the blue solid line which obviously follow the prescription.

IV. COMPARISON WITH THE EXPERIMENTS ON UNIFORM + DIPOLE

FLOW FIELD

We want to test these selection predictions against the experiments. Due to the contact with

the solid disk mentioned above, the range of accessible u values was limited. Therefore, we

design an analogous experiment which allows a wider range of u values. If we remember that the

potential ﬂow around a solid disk in a Hele-Shaw is nothing but the one around an hydrodynamic

dipole (immaterial solid), we can design such an experiment. The fresh, blue reactant is injected

from left to right as in Fig. 1 at a ﬂow at constant velocity U0. The ”solid” obstacle is mimicked

by an hydrodynamic dipole, injecting burnt, yellow product by the leftmost hole (source) and

sucking it from the other hole (sink) at the same ﬂow rate (U+ = −U−); the distance between

holes is d = 5 mm. Keeping constant the ratio U0/U+ provides an immaterial solid disk of

constant radius in a uniform ﬂow ﬁeld U0 [28].

The four pictures on Fig. 4 correspond to the Frozen Fronts achieved at diﬀerent ﬂow rates

keeping U0/U+ = 2 constant. The bottom right ﬁgure is a plot of the position |h0|/d of the front

on the symmetry axis versus the reduced ﬂow rate u = |U0/Vχ|: the squares are the experimental

data the continuous line the theoretical selection obtained using the above paragraph procedure

to the fourth order assuming an eikonal equation with the experimental value of lχ/d = 0.04:

the agreement is quite reasonable validating both the relevance of the eikonal equation in such

an experiment and the selection procedure.

V. PHASE DIAGRAM OF DIFFERENT CLASS OF FROZEN FRONTS AROUND

A SOLID DISK.

In the experiments (Fig. 1) we have been able, depending on the initial conditions to observe

for the same ﬂow rate u two diﬀerent kinds of Frozen Front: an upstream frozen front avoiding

the obstacle and a downstream one in contact with the solid disk.

It is worth addressing the

issue of the existence of this two kinds of front with the two control parameters u and lχ,

11

FIG. 4: Frozen chemical front in a ﬂow around an hydrodynamic dipole. The fresh, blue reactant

is injected from left to right as in Fig. 1 at a ﬂow at constant velocity U0. The ”solid” obstacle is

mimicked by an hydrodynamic dipole, injecting burnt yellow product by the leftmost hole (source)

and sucking it from the other hole (sink) at the same ﬂow rate (U+ = −U−); the distance between

holes is d = 5 mm. In all the pictures, the ratio between U0 and U+ remains the same, hence

mimicking the same immaterial obstacle (see text). From top left to bottom right U0/Vχ = 2, 4, 10.

The graph on the right is a plot of the normalized apex, |h0|/d, the closest distance to the dipole

obtained from the eikonal integration.

that is drawing the phase diagram of these two frozen front types. To cover a wide range of

(u,lχ/R) values, numerical simulations are more suitable than experiments especially for the

control parameter lχ/R. For that purpose, we performed Two Relaxation Times (T RT ) lattice

Boltzmann simulations [26]. We use a 2D 400 × 1000 lattice (Fig. 5) with a solid of size 80

lattice unit diameter. We ﬁrst compute the, low Reynolds number, velocity ﬁeld around this solid

disk with periodic boundary conditions at the top and bottom and a constant ﬂux from left to

front. The bottom diagram is a log-log plot of lχ/R versus u = |U0/Vχ| in which the red dots (•)

right (U0). We wait until a stationary ﬂow ﬁeld is achieved. Then we can switch on the reaction

with as initial conditions for the reactant/product front, a vertical straight line either upstream

(left) of the solid disk (top left in Fig. 5) or in contact with the solid disk on the right (top third

picture from the left in Fig. 5). The chosen values of the reaction characteristics (Vχ and lχ)

[18] ﬁx the two control parameters of the simulation namely u = |U0/Vχ| and lχ/R (propagation

from right to left in the absence of ﬂow).

As ﬂow and reaction act, the front develops, deforms and can achieve a stationary, time inde-

pendent, shape: we observe, depending on the initial conditions, a frozen front either upstream

the disk or downstream link on the solid surface as seen in Fig. 5. Therefore our numerical sim-

the front fails to froze upstream whereas the front frozes downstream leading to the downstream

frozen front. Lower row, lχ/R = 0.35 the front is neither able to froze upstream nor downstream

and propagates to the right.

ulations are able to reproduce the experimental observations of the two types of observed frozen

fronts. For a constant lχ/R as the uniform ﬂow velocity U0 is increased, we observe: for u < 1,

there is no stationary front, the front propagates continuously to the left; for 1 < u < um the

two types of frozen fronts can be achieved, whereas a further increase of u leads to both fronts

detaching and propagating to the right. This is in agreement with the experimental observations,

although for a single experimental lχ value. In the simulations, we can also increase the chemical

length at constant ﬂow rate : above a certain lχm, both types of front become unable to keep

stationary. As discussed later on the um and lχm value can be slightly diﬀerent for the two types

14

of fronts. There is a hierarchy between the stability of the upstream and downstream fronts : for

all the many values of (u,lχ/R), when a upstream front is observed there is also a corresponding

downstream one (black ⊳) in Fig. 5.

In a small window of (u,lχ/R) values we do observe only

the downstream frozen fronts (blue ⊲). This larger stability of the frozen front is demonstrated

on the middle row of Fig. 6 where the upstream front barely try to froze upstream around the

solid disk, but failed whereas it succeeds downstream. The diagram on Fig. 5 is a log-log plot

of lχ/R versus u = |U0/Vχ| in which the red dots correspond to unsteady fronts. This diagram

clearly shows that increasing either u = |U0/Vχ| or lχ/R, keeping the other constant, leads to

the lack of frozen fronts. This can be easily at least qualitatively understood: increasing the ﬂow

velocity results in a frozen front closer to the disk for the upstream front and closer downstream

branches for the downstream one. As a result the velocity increase promotes the front touching

the disk from the left or the two downstream branches to merge. We observe the same eﬀect

by increasing lχ. To be more quantitative, on the log-log plot of Fig. 5 the boundary between

frozen fronts and unsteady fronts is almost straight line of slope ∼ −1, that is u ∼ 1/(lχ/R).

The argument to account for this slope is as follows. The front extension on the symmetry axis

is roughly |h0| ± lχ, the contact with the disk and hence the lack of frozen front corresponds to
|h0| + lχ ∼ R. As the ﬂow velocity on the axis, vx(h0, 0) ∼ u(1 − (R/h0)2) is balanced by the

chemical velocity including the curvature (∼ 1/R) eﬀect (1 − lχ/R) leads to

u(2 + x)x = (1 − x)(1 + x)2 with x = lχ/R

(12)

which, for not too large x, is u ≃ 1

2x = R

, in agreement with the slope on the diagram.

VI. SIMULATION WITH A FINITE lχ VERSUS EIKONAL

From the previous section, we have accurate numerical simulations of the frozen fronts, C(x, y)

for diﬀerent chemical length lχ (and ﬂow rates). Therefore it deserves to compare these simu-

lations with the eikonal limit obtained in the corresponding section. Fig. 7 is the superposition

of the iso-concentration map from the simulation and of the eikonal curve for U0 = −1.5Vχ

and lχ/R = 0.037. Even though for such a small lχ we are already in the plateau 2 of the full

eikonal limit, there not a matching between the two. Of course we cannot expect that the single

concentration jump eikonal curve match with the C = 0.5 iso-concentration of the simulation

but the diﬀerence is surprising, especially far away from the solid disk where the velocity ﬁeld

is uniform

the eikonal expectation: cos(θ0) = 0.66 ≃ 1/1.5.

A ﬁne analysis of the simulations shows that the iso-concentration are quite perfectly straight

lines parallel to one another with an angle θ > θ0 with the x axis. In the direction z perpendicular

to these iso-concentrations, the concentration is ﬁtted almost perfectly by an equation similar to

the chemical front in the absence of ﬂow (Eq. 3): C(z) = (cid:0)1 + exp −( z

w = 2.49 smaller than lχ = 3. As the iso-concentration are parallel straight lines the steady

where Uz = U0cos(θ) is the projection of the uniform velocity on the normal to the iso-

concentrations. Integration of this equation along z from −∞ to ∞ corresponds to the balance

between convective ﬂux and reaction, leading to

Uz = U0cos(θ) = Vχ

As w is smaller than lχ, θ > θ0 is in agreement with what is observed in Fig. 7: θ = 56.5◦ leading

to cos(θ) = 0.55 ≃ 2.49/(3 · 1.5) is in agreement with Eq. 14. These observations deserve

comments. Even if the chemical length is very small compared to the disk size (lχR ≃ 0.037),

we are not in the full eikonal regime lχ → 0 as already observed [9]. The extension of the front,

∼ lχ still matters; in this uniform ﬂow region, the iso-concentrations adapt their spreading as

well as their orientation to fulﬁll the convection reaction balance, the eikonal curve having only

the orientation freedom.

VII. FREE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AT THE DISK SURFACE: EXPERI-

MENTS WITH AN AIR BUBBLE.

The experiments with the dipole design has proved the relevance of the eikonal to account for

the shape of Frozen Fronts around an immaterial obstacle. The problem would not be so easy

for a front originating from the solid surface. In the eikonal limit the front cannot be static: at

the solid surface the ﬂow velocity vanishes

−→
U =

−→
0 and unless the curvature at the surface is of

the order of lχ, the only possibility left from Eq. 4 is

−→
VF =

−→
Vχ as already discovered [6].

To get rid of this lack of velocity at the disk surface, we perform experiments with an air disk,

an air bubble quenched between the two plates of the Hele-Shaw cell: the boundary conditions

between these two ﬂuids (air and chemical solution) are the previous one of zero normal velocity

(vr(R) = 0) but the free boundary allows a non zero tangential velocity vθ at the bubble surface
−→
∇C.−→n = 0) leading to a front

[24]. Moreover, at the bubble surface, there is no ﬂux of matter (

FIG. 8: Frozen chemical front in a ﬂow around an air bubble of diameter 10 mm in a Hele-Shaw

cell at diﬀerent ﬂow rates. Compared to Fig 1, where the disk is solid, the front is perpendicular

to the bubble surface. From left to right u = 1.2, u = 2 and u = 4.

perpendicular to the surface. Therefore the eikonal equation at the bubble surface reduces to :

vθ|R = Vchi. Fig. 8 show pictures of the front on a bubble for diﬀerent ﬂow rates. Compared to

the solid disk Fig. 1, at the bubble surface, the front is perpendicular to the bubble as expected

from the eikonal equation. To be more quantitative on the relevance of the eikonal equation, we

have measure the slopes (or the angle with the symmetry axis) of the straight part of the front,

at the bubble surface (angle θ) and far away from the bubble (α) where the ﬂow is uniform (U0).

These measurements are in reasonable agreement with the eikonal expectations : in the far ﬁeld

U0sin(α) = Vχ and at the bubble surface where the velocity vθ is given from the potential ﬂow

approximation [24], 2U0sin(θ) = Vχ.

Conclusions

We perform experiments, analytical computations and numerical simulations with the

autocatalytic Iodate Arsenious Acid reaction (IAA) over a wide range of ﬂow velocities around

a solid disk. For the same set of control parameters, we observe two types of frozen fronts: an

upstream F F which avoid the solid disk and a downstream F F with two symmetric branches

18

emerging from the solid disk surface. We delineate the range over which we do observe these

Frozen Fronts. We also revisit the so-called eikonal, thin front limit to describe the observed

fronts and to select the frozen front shapes.

[28] Indeed, if the hydrodynamic dipole (intensity p) is equivalent from the mathematical point of view

with a solid disk of radius R = p/(2πU0), here we have a real source and sink which far ﬁeld is

a dipole. Therefore instead of the dipole ﬂow, we use for the selection calculations the velocity

20

ﬁeld of a source and a sink distant of d [27] which will be closer to the experimental velocity ﬁeld

especially for the near ﬁeld.
