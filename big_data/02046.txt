Quantum Renewal Equation for the ﬁrst detection time of a quantum walk

We investigate the statistics of the ﬁrst detected passage time of a quantum walk. The postulates
of quantum theory, in particular the collapse of the wave function upon measurement, reveal an
intimate connection between the wave function of a process free of measurements, i.e. the solution
of the Schr¨odinger equation, and the statistics of ﬁrst detection events on a site. For stroboscopic
measurements a quantum renewal equation yields basic properties of quantum walks. For example,
for a tight binding model on a ring we discover critical sampling times, diverging quantities such as
the mean time for ﬁrst detection, and an optimal detection rate. For a quantum walk on an inﬁnite
line the probability of ﬁrst detection decays like (time)−3 with a superimposed oscillation, critical
behavior for a speciﬁc choice of sampling time, and vanishing amplitude when the sampling time
approaches zero due to the quantum Zeno eﬀect.

A century ago Schr¨odinger [1] discovered a fundamen-
tal connection between occupation probabilities and ﬁrst
passage time distributions [2, 3], a relationship used to
derive some of the most basic properties of classical ran-
dom walks. Ever since, the problem of ﬁrst passage time
statistics has attracted tremendous interest, as it is ap-
plicable to many ﬁelds of science [4, 5]. In a nutshell the
main idea [1] is simple: the path of a Markovian random
walk on a graph, starting at x and reaching 0 at time t,
can be decomposed into a path that arrived at 0 for the
ﬁrst time at time t(cid:48), and then an independent segment
which starts at 0 and returns back in the time interval
t− t(cid:48). The consequence is a well known renewal formula,

the ﬁrst equation in Redner’s monograph [3], relating
occupation probabilities and ﬁrst passage time statistics.
More recently, quantum walks have attracted much in-
terest both theoretically [6–8] and experimentally [9–11].
These exhibit interference patterns and ballistic scaling
and in that sense exhibit behaviors drastically diﬀerent
from the classical random walk. Particularly controver-
sial has been the question of the ﬁrst passage time for
quantum dynamics. The latter is ill deﬁned, so we con-
sider the ﬁrst detected passage time to a site (see details
below) [12–19]. Our main result is the quantum ana-
logue of Schr¨odinger’s classical renewal equation. With
this equation, which deals with amplitudes, rather than
probabilities, we calculate some basic properties of quan-
tum walks, for example the ﬁrst detected passage time
statistics on a line. Our approach is based on a projective
measurement scheme recently introduced by Dhar et al.
[18, 19]. We note that the quest for the quantum renewal
equation, the question of ﬁrst passage time in quantum
mechanics, or more generally the ﬂuctuations of time ob-
servables, has a long hotly debated history. Here we use
the textbook postulates of quantum measurements, in
particular the projective postulate [20], to address the
ﬁrst detection problem of quantum dynamics, the main
restriction being that the Hamiltonian is time indepen-
dent, the latter corresponding to the Markov assumption
used by Schr¨odinger in the classical domain.

Model and the measurement process. We consider a

single quantum particle on a graph, for example a lat-
tice or a discretized ring, whose state wave function is
|ψ(cid:105). Under stroboscopic observations at times τ, 2τ,··· .
an observer performs measurements at a spatial position
which we may call x = 0 which is represented as the vec-
tor |0(cid:105) (see schematic diagram in Fig. 1). Such strobo-
scopic measurements are useful as they capture quantum
periodicities as shown below. A measurement provides
two possible outcomes: either the particle is detected at
x = 0 or it is not. The experiment provides the string:
no, no, no, ··· and ﬁnally at the n-th attempt a yes so
that nτ is the ﬁrst detected passage time, whose statistics
are investigated. For that we must deﬁne the measure-
ment process precisely [18, 19].

Just prior to the ﬁrst measurement the wave function is

|ψ(τ−)(cid:105) = U (τ )|ψ(0)(cid:105) and U (τ ) = exp(−iHτ ) is the uni-
tary evolution operator, H the time independent Hamil-
tonian, |ψ(0)(cid:105) is the wave function at the initial time
t = 0 and ¯h = 1. For example, we will later investigate
the tight-binding model

∞(cid:88)

H = −γ

x=−∞

(|x(cid:105)(cid:104)x + 1| + |x + 1(cid:105)(cid:104)x|) .

(1)

This describes a quantum particle jumping between near-
est neighbours on an inﬁnite one dimensional lattice so
x is an integer and in that sense the model describes a
quantum random walk [8]. We stress that our main re-
sults are not limited to a speciﬁc Hamiltonian.

The probability of ﬁnding the particle in state |0(cid:105), at
the ﬁrst measurement, is P1 = |(cid:104)0|ψ(τ−)(cid:105)|2. If the out-
come of the ﬁrst measurement is positive we get n = 1.
On the other hand, if the particle is not detected, with
probability 1 − P1, Von Neumann’s postulate of collapse
states that the null measurement alters the wave func-
tion in such a way that the probability of detecting the
particle at the detection point x = 0 at time τ + ≡ τ + 0+
is zero. Afterwards, the evolution of the quantum state
will resume until the next measurement time 2τ via the
transformation U (τ ).
In this sense we are considering
projective measurements whose duration is very short,

Solution using generating functions. Eq.

(6) gives
φ1 = (cid:104)0|U (τ )|ψ(0)(cid:105), φ2 = (cid:104)0|U (2τ )|ψ(0)(cid:105) − φ1(cid:104)0|U (τ )|0(cid:105)
and by induction we ﬁnd

φn = (cid:104)0|U (nτ )|ψ(0)(cid:105) −

φj(cid:104)0|U [(n − j) τ ]|0(cid:105).

(7)

This iteration rule yields the amplitude φn in terms of a
propagation free of measurement, i.e. (cid:104)0|U (nτ )|ψ(0)(cid:105) is
the amplitude for being at the origin at time nτ in the
absence of measurements, from which we subtract n − 1
terms related to the previous null measurements of the
particle.
In practice, it is more convenient to work in
terms of the generating function [21] also called the Z
transform ˆφ(z) ≡
n=1 znφn. Multiplying Eq. (7) by
zn and summing over n using the convolution theorem
we get

(cid:80)∞

ˆφ(z) = (cid:104)0| ˆU (z)|ψ(0)(cid:105)
(cid:80)∞
1 + (cid:104)0| ˆU (z)|0(cid:105)

,

(8)

where ˆU (z) ≡
n=1 znU (nτ ). From the generating func-
tion we obtain useful information on the process using in-
version formulae provided in the supplementary material
(SM).

Quantum renewal equation. For a particle free of any
measurement, the amplitude of being at the origin at
time t is (cid:104)0|ψf (t)(cid:105) and |ψf (t)(cid:105) = exp(−iHt)|ψf (0)(cid:105).
Here |ψf (t)(cid:105) is the solution of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion i∂t|ψf(cid:105) = H|ψf(cid:105), with the same initial conditions
as for the ﬁrst detection problem under investigation
|ψf (0)(cid:105) = |ψ(0)(cid:105). Let us consider the initial condition
where the particle is initially localized at x = 0 and so
|ψ(0)(cid:105) = |0(cid:105). Using (cid:104)0|0(cid:105) = 1, Eq. (8) is rewritten

ˆφ(z) = 1 −

the geometric series, we get the appealing result

ˆφ(z) = 1 −

(cid:104)0|ψf (z)(cid:105)0

(11)

Thus, the generating function of the ﬁrst detection time
amplitude ˆφ(z) is determined from the Z transform of
the wave function at the point of detection x = 0.

FIG. 1. Schematic models of a benzene-like ring, represent-
ing a closed geometry, and an inﬁnite one dimensional lattice.
Measurements on site x = 0 are made stroboscopically at time
τ, 2τ, ... to capture periodicities in the underlying dynamics.

while between the measurements the evolution is accord-
ing to the Schr¨odinger equation.

Since the outcome of a null measurement is zero am-
plitude for ﬁnding the particle at x = 0 at time τ + we
have

|ψ(τ +)(cid:105) = N (1 − |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|)|ψ(τ−

)(cid:105),

(2)

where 1 is the identity operator, and N is determined
from the normalization condition. Since just prior to the
measurement the probability of ﬁnding the particle at
x (cid:54)= 0 is 1 − P1, we get [20]

|ψ(τ +)(cid:105) =

U (τ )|ψ(0)(cid:105).

where ˆD = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| is the measurement’s projection op-
erator. The probability of detecting the particle at
the second measurement, conditioned that the quan-
tum walker was not found in the ﬁrst attempt, is P2 =
|(cid:104)0|U (τ )|ψ(τ +)(cid:105)|2. This procedure is continued to ﬁnd
the probability of ﬁrst detection in the n-th measure-
ment, conditioned that prior measurements did not de-
tect the particle [18, 19],

First detection probability Fn. The main focus of this
work is on the probability of ﬁrst detection in the n-th

at attempt n, giving

Fn = (1 − P1)(1 − P2)...(1 − Pn−1)Pn.

where n is a non-negative integer, and ∆E = Ei−Ej > 0
is the energy diﬀerence between pairs of eigenenergies of
the underlying Hamiltonian. These exceptional points
exhibit non-analytical behaviors, diverging moments of
n and critical slowing down, as we now discuss.

For example, for a benzene-like ring of size L = 6,
schematically shown in the upper part of Fig. 1, Eq.
(13) gives (cid:104)n(cid:105) = 4. The energy levels are ±γ and ±2γ,
the former are doubly degenerate. Using Eq. (11) we
ﬁnd (cid:104)n(cid:105) = 1, 3, 2, 2,··· for the exceptional points given
by Eq. (14) γτ = 0, π/2, 2π/3, π ··· which is continued
periodically, see Fig. 2. Physically, the condition Eq.
(14) implies a partial revival of the wave packet free of
measurement, namely two modes of the system are be-
having identically when strobed at period τ . When τ = 0
we get the expected result, the particle is detected im-
mediately and then (cid:104)n(cid:105) = 1, which is also found when
γτ = 2π, namely at a full revival period.

Exceptional sampling times manifest themselves in dif-
ferent ways depending on the observable and the initial
condition. For example, consider again the average (cid:104)n(cid:105)
for the benzene-like ring but now with the initial condi-
tion that the particle is localized at the site x = 3 (see
Fig. 1). Eq. (12) gives, except for the exceptional τ s,

(cid:104)n(cid:105) =

27 + 23 cos(γτ ) + 24 cos(2γτ ) + 9 cos(3γτ ) − 2 cos(4γτ )

9 sin2(2γτ )

.

(15)
The result, presented in Fig. 2, shows that (cid:104)n(cid:105) diverges
when sin(2γτ ) → 0. When τ → 0 the measurements be-
come very frequent and then the probability of measuring
the particle approaches zero and so (cid:104)n(cid:105) diverges, which is
the manifestation of the quantum Zeno eﬀect [22]. A sim-
ilar blowup of (cid:104)n(cid:105) is observed when γτ → 2π, since the
wave packet fully revives on its initial position x = 3 and
so the measurements do not detect the particle. Sim-
ilarly (cid:104)n(cid:105) diverges also for γτ approaching π/2, π, 3π/2
due to partial revivals. A far more subtle eﬀect takes
place on the special sampling times γτ = 2π/3, 4π/3.
There (cid:104)n(cid:105) exhibits a discontinuity: on these exceptional
points (cid:104)n(cid:105) = 4/3 while in their vicinity we ﬁnd from Eq.
(15) (cid:104)n(cid:105) (cid:39) 2. Thus the eﬀects of exceptional points on
observables are non-trivial. We have found several other
peculiar behaviors for rings [23], but now we turn to the
case of an unbounded quantum walk, since the corre-
sponding classical problem is fundamental in stochastic
theories, e.g., it gives the random walk exponents through
the long tailed ﬁrst passage PDF [1]. Note that Bach, et
al. [13] treated the detection problem for a discrete time
Hadamard quantum walk, leading to behaviors diﬀerent
from what we ﬁnd here.

First detection time for an unbounded quantum walk
described by the tight binding Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is
now investigated. For a particle starting at the origin,

for a benzene-like ring where the starting point is on x = 3
(blue) or x = 0 (red) and the detection is on x = 0.

Similarly, for an initial condition initially localized at
a site x (cid:54)= 0, so that |ψ(0)(cid:105) = |x(cid:105), for detection at site 0
we ﬁnd that

ˆφ(z) = (cid:104)0|ψf (z)(cid:105)x
(cid:104)0|ψf (z)(cid:105)0

,

(12)

|ψf (z)(cid:105)x = (cid:80)∞

where |ψf (z)(cid:105)x is the Z transform of the wave func-
tion free of measurements initially localized on site
n=0 zn|ψf (nτ )(cid:105)x with |ψf (nτ )(cid:105)x =
x,
exp(−iHnτ )|x(cid:105). Eqs.
(11,12) are the quantum coun-
terparts of the classical renewal equation Eq. 1.2.3 (or
Eq.
I.18) in [2, 3] respectively. The latter deals with
the correspondence between occupation and ﬁrst passage
time probabilities, while we have found the connection
between the amplitudes φn and the wave function |ψf(cid:105).
In that sense we have reduced the problem of ﬁrst detec-
tion time to the computation of the Z transform of the
solution of the Schr¨odinger equation.

Rings. We ﬁrst consider a tight-binding ring with L
sites, namely the Hamiltonian Eq.
(1) with periodic
boundary conditions. The solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation |ψf(cid:105) is computed with standard methods. To
ﬁnd φn we use the inverse Z transform (see SM). For an
x = 0 initial condition, i.e.
|ψ(0)(cid:105) = |0(cid:105), where x = 0
is also the location of the detector, we ﬁnd the following
three results: (i) The particle is detected with probabil-
ity 1 and in this sense the quantum walk is recurrent.
(ii) Besides isolated sampling times τ listed below, the
average number of detection attempts is

This result is remarkable since it is independent of the

where J0(x) is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. Em-

ploying J0 (2γτ n) ∼ cos (2γτ n − π/4) /√πγτ n we obtain

the large n limit of φn. From this asymptotic property of
the Bessel function it becomes clear that the generating
function (cid:104)0|ψf (z)(cid:105)0 does not converge when z = r exp(iθ)
with θ = ±2γτ and r ≥ 1. Thus, as shown in the SM,
when we invert ˆφ(z) to ﬁnd φn, we ﬁnd two branch cuts
in the complex (r, θ) plane. These branch cuts merge
when 2γτ is an integer multiple of π, a mathematical ob-
servation which is behind the critical behavior we ﬁnd
below.

In the SM we derive another one of our main results:

ing to its origin for the ﬁrst time after n attempts

(17)

This formula, which is valid for large n, is the quantum
version of the ﬁrst passage time problem of a classical one
dimensional non-biased walker which exhibits the well

[1, 3]. The role of sampling time in the quantum prob-

known power law and monotonic tail Fclassical ∝ n−3/2
lem is crucial. When τ → 0 the prefactor of the n−3

power law in Eq. (17) vanishes, a manifestation of the
quantum Zeno eﬀect (a similar eﬀect is found for all ini-
tial conditions). Furthermore, the formula predicts that
when γτ /π is rational the probability Fn multiplied by
n3 is periodic.
In contrast if γτ /π is not rational the
asymptotic behavior appears irregular (see Fig. 3). In

pure power law. However the sampling time 2γτ = π is
exceptional and for this case a detailed calculation reveals

the limit 2γτ → π Eq. (17) gives Fn ∼ n−3 which is a
Fn ∼ n−3/4 so a factor of 4 mismatch is found (see SM).

In this sense exceptional points are found also for an inﬁ-
nite system. This in turn implies a critical slowing down
when 2γτ (cid:39) π (see SM), a behavior that cannot be an-
ticipated without a detailed calculation. Physically, the
energy band width of a ring of size L → ∞ is ∆E = 4γ
and inserting that in Eq. (14) with n = 1 we get the
exceptional sampling time of the inﬁnite system.

Summary. We have derived the long sought after
quantum renewal equation, obtaining the ﬁrst detection
probability of an unbounded quantum random walk in
one dimension, and ﬁnding unusual non-analytical be-
havior even for a small benzene-like ring. Our results
are thus the quantum version of Schr¨odinger’s pioneer-
ing work on the classical ﬁrst passage time problem from
a century ago [1]. The applications of our main formulas
are vast, since they are not limited to a speciﬁc Hamilto-
nian. We note that stroboscopic sampling is very useful
in quantum systems, since this reveals revivals, critical

used in this work could be extended to other measure-

The latter is the average of n only when the particle is detected with probability one, namely when S∞ = 0. Thus with
the knowledge of the generating function we may compute the statistical properties of the ﬁrst detection problem.

Benzene-like ring

As we showed in the text, to ﬁnd ˆφ(z) one must ﬁrst ﬁnd |ψf(cid:105), and as well known, this time dependent solution
of the Schr¨odinger equation is governed by the energy spectrum {Ek} and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, together
with the initial condition. For a benzene-like ring, with initial condition on x = 0 we ﬁnd

The nondegenerate energy levels {Ek} (k = 0, ..., 5) are −2γ and 2γ while −γ and γ are doubly degenerate. We use
Eqs. (19, 20, 21) to derive results presented in the text, and similarly for other initial conditions. The integrals can
be evaluated analytically (to be published) but also numerical integration provides suﬃciently accurate results. We
note that the structure of Eq. (22) remains for a ring of any size L, namely the energy levels of the system determine
the generating function completely, for the case when we start at x = 0.

Table I summarizes the behavior of S∞ for the benzene-like ring. For the initial conditions x = 0 and x = 3 we
ﬁnd the classical behavior S∞ = 0 for nearly all sampling rates. However, on what we call exceptional sampling times
γτ = 0, π/2, 2π/3 etc we ﬁnd non-classical behaviour for the initial condition x = 3. Another feature presented in
the table are half dark states, namely states where the particle is found with probability 1/2 for nearly all sampling
points.

TABLE I. The survival probability S∞ for a quantum walker on a benzene-type ring for diﬀerent localized starting points
|ψ(0)(cid:105) = |x(cid:105). Measurements are at x = 0 and hence initial conditions on sites 1 and 2 are equivalent to initial conditions on 5
and 4 respectively. 0 < γτ < 2π∗ implies all values of γτ in the interval, besides the exceptional points listed on the top row.

First detection for unbounded particle.

Here we analyse the large n behavior of φn for an unbounded tight binding quantum walk, where initially the walker
is localized at the origin. The analysis is performed via integration in the complex plane using Eqs. (16, 19). We
deﬁne

∞(cid:88)

I(z) =

z ˜nJ0 (2γ ˜nτ ) ,

and hence the generating function is

˜n=1

ˆφ(z) =

I(z)

1 + I(z)

.

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

As we shall see, the large n behavior of ˆφn is determined by the singularity structure of I(z), which in turn is controlled
by the large ˜n terms in the sum Eq. (23). In the large ˜n limit the asymptotic behavior of the Bessel function is

Thus, we deﬁne

J0 (2γτ ˜n) ∼

cos (2γτ ˜n − π/4)

√πγτ ˜n

.

∞(cid:88)

˜n=1

Iγτ (z) =

z ˜n cos (2γτ ˜n − π/4)

√πγτ ˜n

.

Then the large n limit of φn is given by the inversion of

ˆφ(z) ∼

Iγτ (z)

1 + Iγτ (z)

.

Inﬁnite system γτ = π/2

Considering the case γτ = π/2, we ﬁnd Iπ/2(z) = π−1Li1/2(−z), where the polylog Li1/2(z) is deﬁned by

Li1/2(z) =

We ﬁrst investigate the branch cut of this function in the complex plane.

On the Polylog

We want to understand the behavior of the polylog function near the singularity at z = 1. The simplest approach

is simply to ask Mathematica.

Li1/2(z) ≈

We want to calculate φn, using the inverse z transform of

Undoing the z Transform for γτ = π/2

ˆφ(z) =

One can show that there are no poles inside the unit circle, hence the dominant contribution arises from the branch
cut of the polylog, namely ˆφ(z) has a branch cut along the negative z-axis. Now, as mentioned

(cid:73)

φn =

dz

2πizn+1

ˆφ(z),

(38)

where the contour encloses the origin and does not cross the branch cut. We can deform the contour so that it
goes counter-clockwise along the circle at inﬁnity from θ = −π − i to θ = π + i, runs along the branch cut from
z = −∞ + i, goes around the point at z = −1 in an inﬁnitesimal circle and returns along the bottom of the branch
cut back out to inﬁnity. The contribution from the circle at inﬁnity vanishes and so we are left with the integral along
the branch cut, so that

where as above the discontinuity is taken from above to below the branch cut. Changing variables to y = −z − 1, we
have

φn =

(−1)n+1e−(n+1) ln(1+y)Disc[ ˆφ(−1 − y)].

(40)

For n (cid:29) 1, the exponential factor cuts oﬀ the integral for y (cid:29) 1/n, and so we can use the small y expansion of the
rest of the integrand. Then

ˆφ(−1 − y ± i) =

Putting this all together, we get

φn ∼

Hence for the exceptional sampling time 2γτ = π we get Fn = |φn|2 ∼ n−3/4 as reported in the text. As a test,
computing φ20 and φ40 numerically, we have φ20(20)3/2 = 0.470, φ40(40)3/2 = 0.484, which is consistent with a 1/n
convergence to 1/2.

The General Calculation

We now consider the unbounded quantum walk, still starting on the origin, but now for a general sampling rate.

Deﬁne α = 2γτ and the function

in terms of which we deﬁne

Q(z, σ) =

(cid:114)

R(z) =

[Q(z, 1) − Q(z,−1)].

ˆφ(z) =

R(z)

1 + R(z)

.

Now, ˆφ(z) has two branch cuts extending along the rays z± = e±iα(1 + y) for y > 1. Note that these coincide in
the case α = π considered above. Q(z, 1) has a branch cut along z− but is ﬁnite along z+ and vice versa. Using our
expansion of the polylog, we have

This immediately gives Fn = |φn|2 Eq.
(17) in the main text. For example, for α = π/5, the formula predicts
φ40(40)3/2 = φ80(80)3/2 = .447, whereas in truth (obtained with a symbolic program by Taylor expansion of exact
result of ˆφ(z) to order zn) it is 0.458 for n = 40 and 0.453 for n = 80, so that the error again falls as 1/n. For a
non-rational value of α/π, the formula also works. For example, for α = 1/5, the formula predicts φ80 = −2.36· 10−4,
whereas the exact answer is −2.44 · 10−4. The strange aspect of the formula is that the limit of φn for α → π does
not reproduce the value at α = π we found above. This is no doubt due to the presence of two branch cuts for α (cid:54)= π,
whereas there is only one at α = π. This implies that the convergence of the formula for α close to π must be a little
funny. Thus, for α = 0.95π, we have that at n = 40 the ratio of prediction to exact is −2.72 (i.e., even the sign is
wrong), whereas for n = 60 the ratio is 0.705, for n = 80, the ratio is 1.03, at n = 100, the ratio is 0.947, and at
n = 120, the ratio is 0.968, so things are converging, even though even intermediate n’s are way oﬀ. The formula also
works for α > π. Thus, for α = 11π/7, the ratio is 0.987 at n = 190. Similar eﬀect takes place for α which is an
integer multiple of π. Finally we note that unlike a classical random walk in one dimension, the eventual probability
of being detected is not unity, so even a one-dimensional walk is not recurrent (unless τ = 0 which is the trivial case).
We will discuss this eﬀect and many others in a longer publication, but for now present 1 − S∞ versus γτ in Fig. (4).
