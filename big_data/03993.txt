Entanglement-assisted quantum communication employs pre-shared entanglement between sender
and receiver as a resource. We apply the same framework to quantum metrology, introducing shared
entanglement between the preparation and the measurement stage, namely using some entangled
ancillary system that does not interact with the system to be sampled. This is known to be useless
in the noiseless case, but was recently shown to be useful in the presence of noise. Here we detail
how and when it can be of use. For example, surprisingly it is useful when randomly time sharing
two channels where ancillas do not help (depolarizing). We show that it is useful for all levels of
noise for many noise models and propose a simple optical experiment to test these results.

Entanglement-assisted communication [1–3] employs
pre-shared entanglement between sender and receiver in
addition to the signals sent through the channel. This
doubles the capacity of a noiseless channel, as illustrated
in the well known superdense coding protocol [1], and is
even more beneﬁcial in the presence of noise [3, 4]. Here
we apply the same framework to quantum metrology [5–
9], which studies how quantum eﬀects may aid parameter
estimation.

A quantum parameter estimation is composed of three
stages (Fig. 1a):
the preparation stage, where some
probe systems are initialized; the sampling stage, where
the probes interact with the system to be sampled
(this interaction encodes the parameter on the probes);
the measurement stage, where the probes are measured
and the outcome is processed to yield the parameter
estimate.
Entanglement-assisted quantum metrology
(Fig. 1b) refers to the scenario in which the probes are
entangled with an ancilla that does not participate to
the sampling stage (similar ideas have also been stud-
ied in the context of noisy channel estimation [10, 11]).
Then at the measurement stage a joint measurement is
performed between probes and ancilla. It was recently re-
alized that this is useful in the presence of noise [12–17],
although it was known to be useless in the noiseless case
[5]. Here we detail how entangled ancillas can be used,
what are the gains one can achieve and which explicit
measurement strategies can achieve such gains, analyz-
ing the most important qubit channels. We also propose
a simple experiment that can test our results.

The entanglement-assisted scenario should not be con-
fused with the generic use of entanglement in quantum
estimation, that has been extensively studied previously,
e.g. [5, 18–26], showing how entangled probes achieve
better precision than unentangled ones.
It is also dif-
ferent from the application of quantum error correction
to metrology [13–15, 27] where all the systems are in-
volved in the interaction (Fig. 1c), although some sce-
narios analyzed in Refs. [13–15, 27] go beyond this con-
ventional quantum error correction scheme. Instead, in
the entanglement-assisted scenario, the ancilla does not
interact and can be considered as noiseless, if we suppose

(as is often the case) that the noise is relevant especially
during the interaction stage. This translates into a re-
duced noise acting on the global state and a reduced re-
source count: indeed in quantum metrology the resource
count refers to the number of times that the probed sys-
tem is sampled [8]. So, the entangled ancillas should be
accounted for as separate resources, as is done in quan-
tum communication [1–3].

FIG. 1.
(a) Conventional quantum parameter estimation:
probes are prepared in a joint entangled state, they interact
(independently) with the probed system through a noisy map
Λϕ, and they are jointly measured. (b) Entanglement-assisted
parameter estimation: ancillary systems are employed that do
not interact with the probed system. (c) QEC schemes: af-
ter the interaction the errors are corrected and, possibly, the
probes interact again.

We will detail the increase in achievable precision in
the presence of an entangled ancilla with respect to the
one achievable in its absence,
instead of dealing with
the issue of whether one can beat the standard quan-
tum limit or achieve the Heisenberg bound. Indeed, it
is known that the Heisenberg scaling cannot be achieved
asymptotically for many of these noise models [28–32],
although it can often be achieved in the non-asymptotic
regime [33–35]. Interestingly, it has been pointed out [13–
15] that the Heisenberg scaling can be recovered through
entanglement-assisted metrology even asymptotically in

only a lower scaling is achieved in the absence of an-
cillas [25]. However a general analysis of entanglement-
assisted metrology was lacking up to now: our results
show the attainable precision enhancement for the case
of the Pauli channels (including the fully depolarizing
case) and of the amplitude damping. Moreover, dephas-
ing and erasure noise do not allow for any enhancement
in the entanglement-assisted scenario, although entangle-
ment among the probes is helpful [12]. Our analysis then
concludes the study of entanglement-assisted estimation
for all relevant qubit channels.

Most previous literature studies the precision through
the quantum Cramer-Rao (QCR) bound, with the
promise that such a lower bound to precision is signiﬁcant
because it is asymptotically achievable. However, since
we want achieveability in the non-asymptotic regime, we
must provide estimation strategies and prove that they
achieve the QCR, at least in a feedback scenario [36, 37].
Indeed, both the QCR and the error in the employed
strategy may depend on the unknown parameter to be
estimated [38], but a feedback strategy converges expo-
nentially to the “sweet spot” [39], so that it has only a
logarithmic cost in terms of resources [36]. Even though
the rigorous way to determine phase errors is the Holevo
variance [40, 41], as is usually done in the literature we
will use the customary variance, since the two match for
suﬃciently precise estimation strategies.

The QCR [18, 19, 40, 42] is a lower bound to the
precision ∆ϕ of the estimation of a parameter ϕ: un-

der reasonable hypotheses, ∆ϕ (cid:62) 1/(cid:112)νJ(ρϕ) where ν

is the number of times the estimation is repeated, and
J is the quantum Fisher information (QFI) associated
to the global state ρϕ of probes and ancillas (after the
interaction Λϕ with the probed system). The QFI is

J(ρϕ) =

j,k:λj +λk(cid:54)=0

2|(cid:104)j|ρ(cid:48)

ϕ|k(cid:105)|2/(λj + λk) ,

(1)

ϕ = ∂ρϕ/∂ϕ, λj and |j(cid:105) are the eigenvalues and
where ρ(cid:48)
eigenvectors of ρϕ. The map Λϕ encodes the phase pa-
rameter ϕ onto the probes: ρϕ = Λϕ[ρ], where ρ is the ini-
tial state. Without loss of generality, for qubit channels
we suppose that the phase is encoded onto the computa-
tional basis by the unitary Uϕ = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|+eiϕ|1(cid:105)(cid:104)1|. For the
sake of simplicity we will consider situations where the
noise maps E acts after Uϕ, namely Λϕ = E ◦ Uϕ. If the
noise map and Uϕ do not commute, this is an important
restriction of our analysis (required to make the problem
tractable, as nontrivial eﬀects arise otherwise [25]), but
it is not a restriction for the erasure, amplitude damping
and depolarizing noise models which commute with Uϕ.
To ﬁnd the best bound, one must maximize the QFI,
which in general depends both on the input state ρ and
on the unknown parameter ϕ. The former optimiza-
tion depends on the noise map, the latter can be taken
care of using feedback mechanisms [36–39]. For all noise

(The QFI is not convex if λj de-
pended on ϕ, but an extended convexity still holds [34].)

where η is the probability of decay |1(cid:105) → |0(cid:105). This map
is agnostic on the direction of the x and y axis of the
Bloch sphere: a rotation around the z axis leaves A0
unchanged and adds an inconsequential phase factor to
A1. Thus we can optimize the single-probe input state
1 − 2|1(cid:105). The optimal state
among the family |0(cid:105) +
2, and its QFI is 1 − η. To show that
has  = 1/
entanglement-assisted strategies perform better, we com-
pare this QFI with the one of an entangled state of probe
1 − γ2|11(cid:105). This state might
and ancilla |ψγ(cid:105) = γ|00(cid:105)+
not be the optimal state for the entanglement-assisted
strategy, but it outperforms the previous one.
Indeed
its corresponding output state (Λϕ ⊗ 11)[|ψγ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψγ|] (where
√
the map acts only on the probe qubit and not on the an-
cilla) has a QFI of 4(1 − η)/(
1 − η + 1)2 (also shown by
[17]), if one optimizes over γ for each η. Even the simple
choice γ = 1/
2 is advantageous for all η as its QFI is
2(1 − η)/(2 − η). These QFIs are compared in Fig. 2a.
One observable that achieves the QCR bound for the
2 (|00(cid:105)+
last QFI is O = Πψ +2|Φ+(cid:105)(cid:104)Φ+|, with |Φ+(cid:105) = 1√
|11(cid:105)) and Πψ = (|01(cid:105)(cid:104)01| + |10(cid:105)(cid:104)10|). Indeed, measuring
the observable O, the error on ϕ is

This expression is optimized for ϕ = π/2, where the
Cramer-Rao bound of the optimal single-probe state is
beaten performing Bell measurements between probe and
ancilla. As discussed above, we can perform the opti-
mization ϕ → π/2 using a feedback strategy [36–39] that
uses an additional phase factor [36] in the interferometer
to drive the global phase to this “sweet spot”.

The ancilla-assisted advantage persists also when we
use entangled probes. The case without ancillas was an-
alyzed in [31] where an upper bound N (1 − η)/η to the
Fisher information was given, which is achievable in the
high-noise regime N η/(1 − η) (cid:29) 1.

In the case of two qubit probes, one can also perform a
numerical optimization of the QFI on generic two-qubit
states (presented in Fig. 2b, solid line).
Interestingly, the performance of the optimal state is
similar to the “noon” state |Φ+(cid:105), which is known to be
optimal in the noiseless case. However, all these strate-
gies can be beaten by using ancillas (as was noted also in
[12], although no explicit example was presented there).

with σx, σy, σz Pauli matrices, and p1, p2 and p3 prob-
abilities. Two special Pauli channels are the dephasing
and the depolarizing noise. Dephasing noise corresponds
to p1 = p2 = 0 in (4) and it was proved that ancil-
las oﬀer no advantage over the unentangled probe [12]:
for both cases the optimal QFI of a single-qubit probe
is (1 − 2p3)2. Depolarising noise corresponds to having
p1 = p2 = p3 ≡ p/4 in (4): it describes an isotropic loss
of coherence . As was also shown in [17], in this case
ancillas do help: indeed for a single-qubit probe, the op-
2(|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105)) where the QFI is (1 − p)2,
timal state is 1/
whereas the QFI for a probe maximally entangled with
an ancilla is 2(1 − p)2/(2 − p), which is always greater .
This result is very surprising since the depolarizing
channel can be seen as a time-sharing (with probability
1−p) of a noiseless channel and a channel where the state
of the probe is replaced by a maximally mixed state 11/2
(useless for estimation). For both of these channels the
use of an ancilla gives no advantage: the ancilla becomes
important only when they are randomly time-shared.
√
One observable that achieves the QCR for the single-
2(|0(cid:105)+|1(cid:105)), and for
qubit probe is O = |+(cid:105)(cid:104)+| ,|+(cid:105) = 1/
the ancilla-assisted case, O = Πψ + 2|Φ+(cid:105)(cid:104)Φ+| (identical
with the one for the ADC).

Even though dephasing and depolarizing channels
commute with the unitary Uϕ, in general the Pauli chan-
nel does not: we will consider the case where the noise
acts only after Uϕ. For a single qubit probe in the generic
initial state |0(cid:105) +

1 − 2eiα|1(cid:105), the QFI is

(na stands for “no ancilla”), which is maximized for  =

(or, equivalently, α) using a feedback strategy. To prove
that the presence of an ancilla is beneﬁcial, we consider
a maximally entangled state 1√

We performed a numerical search over the parameter
space p1, p2, p3. For all possible values of p1 +p2 +p3 ≤ 1,
the expression in Eq.(6) is larger than that of Eq. (5) for
all α.

To illustrate this, the comparison between (5) and (6)
is shown in Fig. 3, for the case when p1 = 0 and α+ϕ = 0.
The probe-ancilla observable ˆO = |Φ−(cid:105)(cid:104)Φ−| +|Ψ−(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ−|
achieves the QCR bound relative to the QFI of (6), with

Note that when p1(p2) = 0 and p1(p2) + p3 = 1, the
QFI is unity: this represents the case of orthogonal noise

pared to a genuinely entangled four-qubit state (two probe

per bound to the ancilla-less estimation with two probes from
[31] (dashed), which is achievable in the high noise regime
(where the dashed and continuous lines superimpose). The
ancilla-assisted strategy beats any entangled-probe strategies
for η < 0.7. The state can be further optimized.

of two probes for noise levels η ≈ 0.7, where its QFI is

, which is opti-
((η−2)η+2)3
mal for ϕ = 2πn

able that achieves the QCR for the single-qubit probe is

Note that this particular four-qubit state is not neces-
sary optimal.

trolled noise was introduced in an ancilla-assisted sce-

Conclusions:— In conclusion, we have studied the
role of entangled ancillas in metrology for the impor-
tant classes of qubit noise models. We have shown that,
for a single probe, in the presence of amplitude damp-
ing, depolarizing noise as well as general Pauli noise, an
entanglement-assisted scheme provides an advantage in
the eﬃciency of phase measurement over the unentan-
gled case for all ranges of noise regimes. We also derived
the optimal measurement procedures which achieve the
Cramer-Rao bound.

out in [13–15].

Experiment proposal:— We propose here an experi-
mental scheme to implement our proposal, based on the
use of a single photon, where two qubits are encoded in
the path and polarisation degrees of freedom.

√

Such a scheme, that can simulate the ancilla-assisted
strategy, is shown in Fig.4. The experiment uses a single
photon which is prepared in a polarization-path entan-
gled state as follows and the noise acts on the polariza-
tion degree of freedom. The initial polarisation state of
2 (|H(cid:105) + |V (cid:105)). A polar-
1√
the photon in this scheme is
izing beam splitter (PBS) then transmits |H(cid:105) and re-
ﬂects |V (cid:105). Therefore, PBS1 acts as an eﬀective CNOT
gate and puts into a polarization-path entangled state
2(|Ha(cid:105)+|V b(cid:105)) (red solid = a, blue dashed = b). The
1/
state is then transformed according to the unitary Uϕ and
the noisy channel. Diﬀerent noise models can be added,
e.g. using the techniques implemented in [43]. If the bit is
ﬂipped, the ﬂipped component is directed by PBS2 and
PBS3 onto another path, which interfere at BS2. The
half wave plate (HWP) rotates V polarization to H so
that they interfere at the 50:50 beam splitter (BS). The
which-arm statistics after the BS are eﬀective projective
Bell measurements in this basis. That is, at BS1, the out-
