ABSTRACT

Context. The X-ray absorption spectra of active galactic nuclei frequently show evidence of winds with velocities in the
order of 103 km/s extending up to 104 km/s in the case of ultra-fast outﬂows. At moderate velocities, these winds are
often spectroscopically explained by assuming a number of absorbing clouds along the line of sight. In some cases it
was shown that the absorbing clouds are in pressure equilibrium with each other.
Aims. We assume a photo-ionized medium with a uniform total (gas+radiation) pressure. The irradiation causes the
wind to be radiation pressure compressed (RPC). We attempt to reproduce the observed spectral continuum shape,
ionic column densities, and X-ray absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the extensively observed warm absorber
in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783.
Methods. We compare the observational characteristics derived from the 900 ks Chandra observation to radiative
transfer computations in pressure equilibrium using the radiative transfer code titan. We explore diﬀerent values of
the ionization parameter ξ of the incident ﬂux and adjust the hydrogen-equivalent column density, N 0
H, of the warm
absorber to match the observed soft X-ray continuum. From the resulting models we derive the column densities for a
broad range of ionic species of iron and neon and a theoretical AMD that we compare to the observations.
Results. We ﬁnd an extension of the degeneracy between ξ and N 0
H for the constant pressure models previously discussed
for NGC 3783. Including the ionic column densities of iron and neon in the comparison between observations and data
we conclude that a range of ionization parameters between 4000 and 8000 ergs cm s−1 is preferred. For the ﬁrst time,
we present theoretical AMD for a constant pressure wind in NGC 3783 that correctly reproduces the observed level
and is in approximate agreement with the observational appearance of an instability region.
Conclusions. Using a variety of observational indicators, we conﬁrm that the X-ray outﬂow of NGC 3783 can be described
as an RPC medium in pressure equilibrium. The observed AMD agrees with a uniformly hot or a uniformly cold
thermal state. The measured ionic column densities suggest that the wind tends to the uniformly cold thermal state.
The occurrence of thermal instability in the warm absorber model may depend on the computational method and the
spatial scale on which the radiative transfer is solved.

1. Introduction

The presence of outﬂows in active galactic nuclei (AGN)
shows that black hole accretion is not a one-way process.
Part of the matter pulled in by the black hole is not ac-
creted but re-ejected into ballistic jets or non-collimated
winds. Studying the geometry and dynamics of AGN winds
is important for understanding their launch from an accre-
tion disk (Fukumura et al. 2014; Higginbottom et al. 2014).
Furthermore, it has become clear that winds contribute
to the mechanical AGN feedback onto the host galaxy
(King 2005; Crenshaw & Kraemer 2012; Tombesi et al.
2013) and may inﬂuence star formation in a complex way
(Nayakshin & Zubovas 2012). Finally, if the scaling of black

hole properties is valid over a broad range of masses, the
physics of AGN winds also has implications for the study
of black hole X-ray binaries (King et al. 2013).

Non-collimated outﬂows in AGN are identiﬁed by
shifted and broadened absorption edges or lines in the
X-ray and UV spectrum of many Seyfert-1 galaxies and
quasars (see, e.g., Halpern 1984; Nandra & Pounds 1994;
Komossa & Fink 1997; Reynolds 1997; Crenshaw et al.
1999; Wang et al. 1999; Hamann et al. 2000; Monier et al.
2001; Matsumoto et al. 2004; Ebrero et al. 2013). When de-
tected in the X-ray band the absorbing wind is called “warm
absorber” and attributed to a photo-ionized medium seen
mostly in absorption with a relatively weak component of
reprocessed emission.

Our understanding of the composition and dynam-
ics of AGN winds has greatly improved by using high

such as the Low and High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrometers of Chandra (see, e.g., Kaastra et al. 2000;

codes

With the improved quality of the observations came sub-
stantial improvements in the spectral modeling. Advanced
X-ray radiative transfer codes were combined with state-
of-the-art atomic data bases to analyze the high-resolution
data. Numerical
like cloudy (Ferland et al.
1998, 2013) and xstar (Kallman & Bautista 2001;
Bautista & Kallman 2001; García et al. 2005, 2009) are
frequently used to model the conditions of the photo-
ionization equilibrium, the intensity and spectral shape of
the incident radiation, and the total hydrogen-equivalent
column density of the warm absorber with its numerous
absorption and emission lines in the soft X-ray range. In
this work, we apply the code titan initially presented in
Dumont et al. (2000) and updated in Dumont et al. (2003);
Collin et al. (2004); Gonçalves et al. (2007). It was used to
pioneer the modeling of a warm absorber in pressure equi-
librium (Różańska et al. 2006; Gonçalves et al. 2006, 2007).
The progress in X-ray spectroscopy and modeling over
the last 15 years revealed many details about AGN winds.
Nonetheless, for a complete understanding some key ele-
ments still need to be found, such as the structure and
the thermal state of the wind. In this work, we further ex-
plore the hypothesis that the X-ray outﬂow in the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 3783 is a continuous, photo-ionized medium
in total pressure equilibrium. Our radiative transfer mod-
eling focuses in particular on the reproduction of the ob-
served ionic column densities, the total hydrogen-equivalent
column density, and the absorption measure distribution
(AMD) of the warm absorber (Holczer et al. 2007).

The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we re-
call previous observational and modeling work on the warm
absorber of NGC 3783. The following Sect. 3 presents an
updated version of the AMD analysis and points out the
adjustments with respect to the previous study. Our mod-
eling approach is described in Sect. 4 and the results are
presented in Sect 5. We further discuss our work in Sect. 6
before drawing our conclusions in Sect. 7.

2. A warm absorber in pressure equilibrium

The warm absorber of the X-ray bright narrow-line Seyfert-
1 galaxy NGC 3783 was extensively observed during a
multi-wavelength campaign that involved a 900 ks observa-

Article number, page 2 of 15

tion with Chandra (Kaspi et al. 2001) and 280 ks of XMM-
Newton time (Behar et al. 2003). The total Chandra ob-
servation was collected over six periods of ∼ 170 ks each
and gave rise to a warm absorber spectrum with very high
signal-to-noise. A detailed spectral analysis was carried out
for the time-integrated spectrum (Kaspi et al. 2002) and
for individual observation periods (Netzer et al. 2003). It
turned out that on time scales larger than ∼ 100 ks the
source switches between two diﬀerent ﬂux states. The shape
of the spectral model in both states is very similar suggest-
ing that these ﬂux variations are intrinsic to the source
and do not signiﬁcantly alter the structure of the warm ab-
sorber. The warm absorber could be divided into two sys-
tematic velocity parts that were in agreement with the ve-
locity structure of the associated UV absorber (Gabel et al.
2003). Each velocity component contains three spectro-
scopic components with high, intermediate and low ion-
ization states (Kaspi et al. 2001, 2002). The three spec-
tral components could be modeled by a combination of
constant density clouds irradiated from the backside by
the same incident spectrum. Using a diﬀerent modeling
method, Krongold et al. (2003) found similar results but
only assuming two spectroscopic components.

In the following,

it turned out that the individ-
ual spectroscopic components of the warm absorber in
NGC 3783 lie at the same ratio of radiation-to-gas pressure
(Krolik & Kriss 2001; Netzer et al. 2003; Krongold et al.
2003). Thereby, the radiation pressure largely dominates
compared to the gas pressure. This suggests that the two or
three absorbing clouds are conﬁned by the radiation pres-
sure, a model recently explored by Stern et al. (2014a,b)
and Baskin et al. (2014) for the line emitting regions in ac-
tive galactic nuclei. A radiation pressure compressed (RPC)
wind can be realized by assuming a photo-ionized medium
that is isobaric in terms of the total (gas+radiation) pres-
sure. Such models were explored in Różańska et al. (2006)
and Gonçalves et al. (2007). For the case of NGC 3783,
Gonçalves et al. (2006) presented spectral modeling of an
isobaric RPC wind and reproduced rather accurately the
continuum shape of the soft X-ray spectrum. The contin-
uous medium turned out to be divided into three ioniza-
tion states: thermal instability induced two steep temper-
ature drops between the high/intermediate and intermedi-
ate/low temperature zones. Such a structure is also com-
patible with the UV observations of the low-ionization ab-
sorbers in NGC 3783 (Gabel et al. 2003).

The thermal instability of photo-ionized media was ﬁrst
studied in the AGN context by Krolik et al. (1981). A
key ﬁgure to visualize the instability is the “S-shaped”
curve tracing the temperature of the medium as a func-
tion of the pressure ratio Prad/Pgas. Such curves have
been studied in detail for photo-ionized media at constant
density and in the optically thin limit (Hess et al. 1997;
Krolik & Kriss 1995, 2001; Chakravorty et al. 2008, 2009,
2012). All these modeling campaigns revealed a complex
but systematic dependence of the thermal instability on
the shape of the incident spectrum and the element abun-
dances. Gonçalves et al. (2007) produced theoretical insta-
bility curves for a photo-ionized RPC medium and analyzed
the dependency of the “S-curve” on diﬀerent slopes of the
intrinsic spectrum and on the total column density of the
warm absorber. The study concludes that the thermal in-
stability is a robust phenomenon occurring over a broad

Goosmann et al.: The thermal instability of the warm absorber in NGC 3783

range of incident spectra and column densities of the RPC
wind.

For the warm absorber of NGC 3783, Gonçalves et al.
(2006) found a spectral degeneracy between the intensity of
the incident spectrum and the column density of the warm
absorber. The degeneracy makes it diﬃcult to constrain the
parameters of the wind. In the present work, we therefore
add the observed column densities and the AMD to the
comparison and we explore a wider parameter range to test
if the degeneracy can be removed.

3. Updating the soft X-ray AMD

The soft X-ray spectrum of an AGN outﬂow allows us to
derive the column density of individual ionic species by
measuring the equivalent width of their absorption lines.
It was shown by Steenbrugge et al. (2003) for the case of
the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 that the column density of
diﬀerent ionic species in the warm absorber can cover a
broad range in ionization parameter (counting more than
three orders of magnitude). The derivative of the cumu-
lative hydrogen column density in ionization parameter
dNH/dξ can be related to the measured column density
of the individual ionic species establishing a link between
the ionization proﬁle of the medium and observables of
the warm absorber. The approach was further developed
by Holczer et al. (2007) who introduced the AMD and in-
cluded physical relations between the ionization parameter
ξ and the fractional ionic abundances, fion, at a given loca-
tion inside the wind. The AMD is given as:

AMD =

dNH
d log ξ

, NH = Z AMD d log ξ.

(1)

Herein, NH is the cumulative, hydrogen-equivalent col-
umn density at a given position inside the medium and the
ionization parameter is deﬁned by

ξ =

4π

nH Z 1000 Ryd

1 Ryd

Fion dν

(2)

with Fion being the ionizing ﬂux and nH the hydrogen
number density. Assuming a set of chemical abundances AZ
the ionic column densities are expressed by:

Nion = AZZ AMD fion(ξ) d log ξ.

(3)

With the set of Nion being determined from the ab-
sorption spectrum, the AMD can be computed if the re-
lationships between fion and ξ are known. They were ob-
tained applying the radiative transfer code xstar 2.1kn3
(Kallman & Bautista 2001) for a range of ξ parameters
and a set of chemical abundances AZ. The incident spec-
trum was modeled as a broken power law (see Fig. 7
in Kaspi et al. 2002). Holczer et al. (2007) computed the
AMD of the warm absorber in NGC 3783 assuming the
solar abundances reported by Asplund et al. (2005). These
abundances were updated in Asplund (2009) revealing a
few signiﬁcant diﬀerences with respect to the earlier mea-
surements. We therefore plot here the recomputed AMD for
NGC 3783 in Fig. 1 (see also Holczer & Behar 2012).

Fig. 1. Absorption measure distribution for the warm absorber
of NGC 3783 using the solar chemical abundances measured by
Asplund (2009). The top panel shows the diﬀerential form of the
AMD. In the bottom panel it is integrated up to the total column
density (see equation (1)). A scale in ξ and in temperature T are
provided with the relation T (ξ) being obtained from the xstar
computations of the fractional ionic abundances (see text).

Every ionic column density Nion is determined from a
set of several absorption lines. To have a suﬃciently large
coverage of the AMD as a function of ξ, it is important to
measure lines that all together represent a wide range of
ionization states. The iron absorption lines cover ionization
states starting from Fe IV up to Fe XXVI, which is why iron
is a particularly important element in the AMD analysis.
Apart from iron, the AMD in Fig. 1 compiles a set of ab-
sorption lines from Ne VII up to Ne X. Since the distribution
of absorption lines in ξ is ﬁnite and discrete, the resulting
AMD is of limited resolution and thus approximated by a
step function. The associated error bars are obtained from
a Monte-Carlo ﬁtting method and also comprise the errors
associated to the measurement of the equivalent line widths
(see Holczer et al. 2007, for more details on the method).
Compared to the earlier version of the AMD shown
in Holczer et al. (2007) the new element abundances of
Asplund (2009) do not cause any major changes. As be-
fore, a “forbidden range” in temperature is detected across
which the AMD drops to zero. This interval in ionization
parameter and temperature is presumably associated to a
thermal instability. In the following, we explore this con-
jecture by modeling coherently the radiative transfer inside
the warm absorber.

4. Radiative transfer modeling with titan

Our modeling method is similar to the one adopted in
Gonçalves et al. (2006) and involves the radiative transfer
code titan (Dumont et al. 2000, 2003; Collin et al. 2004;
Gonçalves et al. 2007). The geometrical depth inside the
inﬁnitely wide, plane-parallel medium is measured along
the coordinate axis z and the slab is irradiated at z = 0
by an incident spectrum, Iinc(E). The angular distribution
of the irradiation is closely collimated to the line of sight
along z. At z = ztot, the observed spectrum emerges. Be-
tween the two limiting surfaces, the medium is divided into
a few hundreds of layers and for each layer the radiative
transfer is solved under the condition that the total pres-
sure, Ptot = Pgas + Prad, remains constant throughout the
medium. Our calculations include all relevant absorption,
re-emission and scattering eﬀects. The proﬁles for temper-
ature, fractional ionized abundances and density are com-
puted. The code coherently computes the radiative transfer
along the line of sight, i.e., along the z-axis at µ = cos i = 1
and at ﬁve additional inclinations i chosen to optimize an-
gular integration. We thus add to the pure absorption spec-
trum seen along the line of sight the re-emission from the
slab. The radiative transfer equation is solved along six di-
rections using an Accelerated Lambda Iteration method and
assuming a stationary state for all atomic processes such as
photo-ionization and recombination or line excitation and
de-excitation. The relevant heating and cooling processes
are taken into account. More details about the code and
its successive developments can be found in the aforemen-
tioned four titan papers.

The presence of thermal instability at a given depth in-
side the medium complicates the radiative transfer due to
very steep temperature drops. In addition to this, for the
same local incident ﬂux two or more stable temperature so-
lutions are possible. For this reason, several physical states
of the medium may coexist at the same time, which leads
to a dynamical fragmentation of the gas. One can imagine,
for instance, that relatively cooler and denser gas clouds
are embedded in a hotter, more dilute ambient medium
(Krolik & Kriss 1995). Such a thermal structure would cer-
tainly be time-variable; diﬀerent regions of the cloud are
expected to be in diﬀerent thermal states and changes be-
tween those states are supposed to happen on time scales
limited by the dynamical time scale:

tdyn ∼ 2 × 104 finstN23
√T5n12

[s].

(4)

Herein, n12 denotes the volume density in units of
1012 cm−3, T5 the temperature of the medium in units
of 105 K, and N23 the total column density in units of
1023 cm−2. The value finst denotes the fraction of the
total column density that is in the instability regime.
For a detailed discussion of relevant time scales in the
warm absorber we refer to Gonçalves et al. (2007) and
Chevallier et al. (2007). In the parameter range that we in-
vestigate here we can estimate tdyn to be less than a few
104 s, which is within the X-ray exposure times considered.
From the preceding estimation it follows that a com-
plete, time-dependent treatment of the dynamical and ther-
mal structure together with the radiative transfer inside the
warm absorber in NGC 3783 is not necessary. We also note
that our radiative transfer calculations do not include any

dynamics of the medium on larger spatial scales. The rel-
ative motion between diﬀerent parts of the wind are thus
neglected, which is a reasonable simpliﬁcation for the study
of NGC 3783 since its X-ray spectrum shows rather low
values of line blueshifts. This was shown in a recent study
with Chandra that did not reveal any signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the dynamics of the X-ray absorber in NGC 3783 when
compared to the epoch of 2001/2002 (Scott et al. 2014).

The thermal instability can be included in the model us-
ing diﬀerent computational modes of titan. It is possible
to assume a uniquely cold solution, a uniquely hot solution
or an approximate intermediate solution for the tempera-
ture proﬁle along z. The latter computational mode suﬀers
from the fact that in a stationary scheme it cannot be com-
puted in a completely self-consistent way. The uniquely hot
and cold solutions, on the other hand, represent the two
most extreme thermal states the medium can adopt. If one
chooses the uniformly hot (cold) computation mode, ti-
tan assumes at every thermally unstable position z the
hottest (coldest) stable solution for the temperature bal-
ance. These solutions are thus entirely physical and set the
limits in between which the medium as a whole can ther-
mally evolve. The intermediate temperature solution, ap-
proximation for the radiative coupling, represents a spatial
average across the multiple-phase medium while respect-
ing a coherent solution of the radiative transfer. For more
details about the diﬀerent calculation modes of titan, we
refer to Gonçalves et al. (2007) and references therein.

The temperature solution at a given position zi is found
iteratively by adjusting the local density ni such that the
total pressure remains constant and in agreement with the
incoming and outgoing radiative energy going to or com-
ing from the layers zi−1 and zi+1. At the limits z = 0 and
z = ztot the incoming and outgoing radiation in the for-
ward direction are identical with the incident and the ob-
served spectrum, respectively. Along the line of sight, the
local spectrum evolves due to absorption, scattering and
re-emission processes. Therefore, the local temperature so-
lution in each layer zi of the medium is connected to the
overall solution of the radiation ﬁeld. The presence of ther-
mal instability leads to sharp drops in the temperature
structure, which causes numerical diﬃculties in solving the
radiative transfer equation. The z-grid needs a very ﬁne
stratiﬁcation across the sharp temperature drops, which is
constantly adjusted during the computation and unavoid-
ably increases the necessary CPU time.

The latest version of titan includes several improve-
ments with respect to our previous work (Gonçalves et al.
2006) . The number of spectral lines included in the com-
putations was raised signiﬁcantly and now 4000 line tran-
sitions are taken into account, in particular the unresolved
transition arrays (UTA) of various ionization states of iron.
We adopt the element abundances of H, He, C, O, N, Ne,
Mg, S, Si, and Fe as given by Asplund (2009) and used in
the AMD analysis of Sect. 3. We adopt the deﬁnition of the
(numerical) ionization parameter ξtot deﬁned by

ξtot =

4πFtot

nH

(5)

Goosmann et al.: The thermal instability of the warm absorber in NGC 3783

where nH denotes the hydrogen volume density at the

irradiated surface and Ftot the integrated incident ﬂux:

Ftot = Z ∞

0

Finc(ν)dν

(6)

The above deﬁnition of ξ diﬀers from the one given in
equation (2) by integration over an inﬁnite energy scale.
The total ﬂux Ftot depends on the spectral shape across the
UV and X-ray range. We have adopted here the incident
spectrum that was introduced and justiﬁed by the mod-
eling work of Kaspi et al. (2001, see their ﬁgure 7). Such
an incident spectrum was also adopted by Gonçalves et al.
(2006). We mention here that in the more general analysis of
Gonçalves et al. (2007), the incident spectrum had a power
law shape with a uniform photon index Γ = 2 across the
whole spectral range. With the incident continuum adopted
for our modeling the diﬀerence between both deﬁnitions of
ξ amounts to about 20%. In our modeling results we take
this conversion into account.

Turbulence inside the medium can alter the radiative
transfer, especially the shape of absorption lines. For a frag-
mented warm absorber, we distinguish between micro- and
macro-turbulence: the micro-turbulence refers to a turbu-
lent velocity distribution inside each individual cloud and
therefore adds to the thermal line broadening. Therefore,
it can have an impact on the strength of resonant scatter-
ing lines. The macro-turbulence is due to the velocity dis-
tribution of the individual absorbing clumps all together.
Assuming that the covering factor of the clouds is small,
photons emerging from one cloud are unlikely to further in-
teract with the medium. Therefore the macroscopic turbu-
lence does not have the same eﬀect on the radiative transfer
in spectral lines. For more details about the two types of
turbulence we refer to Godet et al. (2004). In this mod-
eling, we suppose that only micro-turbulence is relevant.
The velocities derived from various blueshifted absorption
lines do not depend on the ionization potential of the lines
with a mean velocity of -590 km/s and a small dispersion
of 150 km/s (Kaspi et al. 2000). The use of the code titan
that cannot include the internal dynamics of the medium
is thus justiﬁed in the absence of strong velocity gradients.
Our primary goal is to compare the observed ionic col-
umn densities and the related AMD to a set of titan
models obtained under the assumption of pressure equi-
librium. We compute models for ﬁve values of the ion-
ization parameter between ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1 and
ξtot = 20000 ergs cm s−1. For a given ξtot, we explore the
two extreme thermal states, the “cold” and the “hot” solu-
tions. For one case (hot solution of ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1)
we also investigate the eﬀects of the turbulent velocity using
a higher value of 400 km/s. Apart from ξtot and the ther-
mal state of the medium, all model ingredients are ﬁxed by
the observational analysis: element abundances, turbulent
velocity, and incident spectral shape.

5. Modeling results

We adjust the total column density N 0
H of the medium un-
til the observed spectral continuum is correctly reproduced.
For this purpose, we use the softness ratio taken between
the two wavelength bands 15–25 Å and 2–10 Å as intro-
duced by Netzer et al. (2003).

For a given ξtot, this softness ratio decreases when the
total column density increases. We keep the value N 0
H for
which this ratio is the closest to the observed one of 0.093 as
derived from the Chandra data. We show a spectral com-
parison between the data and an exemplary model with
ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1 in Fig. 2 for the hot solution.

For each pair (ξtot, N 0

H) obtained in this way (Sect. 5.1),
we compare the observed ionic column densities to the
model values (Sect. 5.2) and we investigate the model tem-
perature proﬁles (Sect. 5.3) as well as the model AMD
(Sect. 5.4) across the warm absorber.

5.1. The total hydrogen column density

The modeled hydrogen column density, N 0
H, of the warm
absorber as a function of the ionization parameter and the
thermal state of the medium is summarized in Table 1.

The resulting N 0

H increases with ξtot, which is expected.
For a stronger ionizing ﬂux the high temperature layer on
the irradiated side of the medium is thicker and therefore
a higher total column density is necessary to obtain lower
temperature regions on the far side. For the same reason the
H obtained at a given ξtot is higher for the hot solution
N 0
than for the cold solution. Indeed, the computational mode
of always choosing the cold over the hot stable solution
when the medium is unstable produces low temperature

regions at smaller distances from the irradiated surface of
the medium.

The observed total column density of 4× 1022 cm−2 de-
rived from the AMD analysis (see bottom panel of Fig. 1)
is compatible with a low ξtot value between 2000 and
4000 ergs cm s−1 for the cold as well as for the hot so-
lution. Note, however, that only very few lines are formed
in the hottest part of the column where the material is
almost fully ionized. In this temperature range, the estima-
tion of the total column density depends strongly on only a
few absorption lines of highly ionized iron. We show in the
following that these observed ionic column densities have
large error bars contributing to a signiﬁcant uncertainty of
the observed total column density.

Gonçalves et al. (2006) derived a best solution with
ξtot = 2500 ergs cm s−1 and N 0
H = 4 × 1022 cm−2, which
is marginally consistent with the range of best solutions
found in this analysis and in agreement with the column
density derived from the observed AMD. Their solution
was obtained by visually ﬁnding the best possible match be-
tween the continuum model and the observed spectrum. We
note that the range of models examined by Gonçalves et al.
(2006) was narrower and, more importantly, we recall that
at the time only “intermediate” solutions were considered.
Futhermore, the number of line transitions included in the
code was much lower (900 versus 4000). Nevertheless the
total N 0
H derived by Gonçalves et al. (2006) is of the same
order of magnitude as the values we derive for the so-
lutions at lower ξtot. Moreover, as already mentioned by
Gonçalves et al. (2006), the spectrum can be ﬁt by degen-
erate pairs of solutions. This degeneracy can be partly re-
moved when comparing the ionic column densities of the
models to those obtained from the observed spectrum (see
Section 5.2). In Gonçalves et al. (2006) this comparison was
done using the measurements by Netzer et al. (2003) that
did not include iron species. We show below that high ion-
ization states are not reproduced in a satisfactory man-
ner by low ξtot models, and thus prevented Gonçalves et al.
(2006) from favoring a solution with higher ξtot. The results
in Table 1 were obtained with the same turbulent velocity
(150 km/s) as in Gonçalves et al. (2006). Here, the hot so-
lution of the ξtot = 8000 model was also computed with
a turbulent velocity of 400 km/s and gave a total column
density of 7.0 1022 cm−2. This is only 5% less than for a
turbulent velocity of 150 km/s.

5.2. The column density of individual ionic species

For each pair of model parameters (ξtot, N 0
H) best reproduc-
ing the shape of the observed continuum spectrum, we com-
pare the ionic column densities derived from the measured
equivalent widths (denoted Ni,obs hereafter and tabulated
in Table 2) with the corresponding model values obtained
by integrating the column density of each ionic species along
the line of sight (denoted Ni,mod). We concentrate on the
ions of iron and neon spanning a wide range in ionization
potential and used to build the observational AMD.

The values are reported in Fig. 3, for both cold and hot
solutions. For the model at higher turbulent velocity, the
ionic fractions diﬀer on average by a factor of 15% from the
values obtained with the nominative velocity value of 150
km/s.

As a whole, the modeled values are roughly in agree-
ment with the measured ones for ξtot > 2000 ergs cm s−1.

Article number, page 6 of 15

Nonetheless, in all cases a large discrepancy is found for
the iron species Fe IV – Fe VIII (not shown in Fig. 3). These
are possibly due to discrepancies in the atomic data enter-
ing the observational analysis and the modeling. Table 2
shows that the Ni,obs of the ions of Fe IV–Fe VIII are also
poorly constrained observationally. Therefore, we exclude
them from our analysis.

For the lowest value of ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1, the
model results diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the data. The oﬀset
between the observed and the modeled Ni is unacceptable
for the ions Fe XXIII–XXVI. At higher values of ξtot, visual
inspection of Fig. 3 suggests a better agreement with the
observations. We try to measure how accurately the model
reproduces the observed column densities by calculating a
reduced χ2 for each case:

(7)

χ2 =

m

Xi=1

[Ni,mod − Ni,obs]2
i,obsi2 ,
hN +

i,obs − N −

where i runs through the total number m of ionic species
that are taken into account and N ±
i,obs are the upper and
lower limits of the error bar attached to the observed value
Ni,obs and reported in Table 2. The results for χ2/m are
plotted in Fig. 4 (left). The solid lines report χ2/m com-
puted for the cold (top) and hot (bottom) solutions includ-
ing only the species of Fe IX–XXVI and Ne VII–X. This case
corresponds to the series of ions chosen for the computation
of the observational AMD presented in Sect. 3.

pentagons and red hexagons for the hot and cold solution, respectively. Top-left: ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1, Top-right: ξtot = 4000

Arabic numbers ion numbers are equivalent to Roman numerals.

The comparison using χ2/m is not entirely satisfac-
tory: while χ2/m adopts a minimum around ξtot =
4000 ergs cm s−1 for both sets of ions when assuming a
cold solution, no minimum can be found in the case of the
hot solution. The bottom-left panel of Fig. 4 suggests that
a minimum would require even smaller ionization param-

eters than ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1, which cannot be in
agreement with the tendency read oﬀ the plots in Fig. 3.
This contradictory behavior can be explained when examin-
ing the observational errors of Ni,obs in Table 2. These are
particularly small for the ions Fe XVIII–XXII giving these
ions a strong impact when calculating χ2/m. In fact, for

vation (black dotted line).

It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a com-
plete model grid that can be used systematically to ﬁt ob-

servational data. This would require a much ﬁner grid in
ξtot and additional model parameters. Note, that in our
approach we already ﬁxed as many parameters as possible
from the observational analysis. We therefore prefer to per-
form a less strict comparison and deﬁne a parameter ∆2 to
estimate the deviation between the observed and the mod-
eled values on a logarithmic scale:

∆2 =

m

Xi=1

Ni,obs i2
hlog Ni,mod
Ni,obs(cid:21)2 .
(cid:20)log

±
i,obs

N

(8)

Between N +

i,obs and N −

i,obs, we choose the value with the
larger diﬀerence |N ±
i,obs− Ni,obs|. The estimator ∆2 is a log-
arithmic version of the χ2 measure. The square of log Ni,mod
Ni,obs
in the numerator evolves by the same amount whether
Ni,mod and Ni,obs diﬀer by a factor a or 1/a. The same
holds true for the denominator when comparing N +
i,obs or
N −
i,obs to the observed value of Ni,obs. We obtain a reduced
∆2/m ∼ 1 when the model diﬀers by the same factor from
the observed ionic column densities as the upper/lower ob-
servational limits.

We plot ∆2/m as a function of ξtot in Fig. 4 (right)
for the two series of ionic species considered in the com-
parison. Again, the largest diﬀerences between model and
observations are found for the lowest ionization parameter
ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1. The best agreement is obtained
for ξtot = 4000 ergs cm s−1 for both hot and cold solutions.
However, the values change by only ∼ 15% when increas-
ing ξtot up to 20000 ergs cm s−1. If the sample used to
compute the diﬀerences ∆2 is restricted to the ions Fe IX–
XXVI (dashed lines), the lowest diﬀerence is obtained for
ξtot = 4000 ergs cm s−1.

In summary, this leads to a range of acceptable values
for ξtot between 4000 and 8000 ergs cm s−1, for hot as well

Goosmann et al.: The thermal instability of the warm absorber in NGC 3783

as for cold solutions. However, the values of ∆2/m or χ2/m
in this interval of ξtot are systematically lower for the cold
solution than for the hot solution, which indicates that the
cold phase predominates in the thermally unstable regime
of the warm absorber.

5.3. Temperature and pressure proﬁles along the line of sight

The temperature proﬁles of our models are plotted in Fig. 5.
They all show characteristic features that have been dis-
cussed in the previous work of Gonçalves et al. (2007).
Here, the spectral shape is more complex, but the mod-
eling still leads to thermal instability eﬀects that split the
temperature distribution into three diﬀerent regimes. The
drop between the high temperature regime at the irradi-
ated side to the middle plateau region is very sharp for
all cases, the drop to the low temperature regime is slightly
more shallow. Both drops correspond to very similar ranges
of temperatures for all computed models: the ﬁrst one is
found at 2.8 × 105 − 1.1 × 106 K and the second one at
5.6 × 104 − 2.0 × 105 K for the cold solutions, and at
2.5 × 105 − 7.0 × 105 K and 5.0 × 104 − 1.8 × 105 K for
the hot solutions. The discontinuities appear in the same
temperature ranges for the model with a higher turbulent
velocity.

The strong resemblance of the temperature proﬁles for
diﬀerent parameters of ξtot is related to very similar pro-
ﬁles of fractional ionic abundances. In Fig. 6 (top), we com-
pare the fractional abundance proﬁles for subsequent ion-
ization states of iron between the two hot solutions of ξtot =
2000 ergs cm s−1 and ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1. The result-
ing proﬁles could practically be superimposed by applying
a systematic shift in column density of 4.12 × 1022 cm−2.
The modeling in Gonçalves et al. (2007) shows how the
instability regime is related to a typical value of the ratio
between radiative and gas pressure. We plot this ratio in
Fig. 6 (bottom) for our models assuming uniformly hot and
cold solutions. We note that the radiative pressure plotted
here is derived from the spectral ﬂux integrated over the
complete wavelength range. The hydrogen column density
of the medium remains moderate for all modeling cases rep-
resenting less than 0.07 Thomson optical depths at maxi-
mum. Therefore, the pressure is dominated by the radiative
pressure at the irradiated surface where the normalization
of the proﬁle rises in the order of increasing ξtot. Going to-
wards deeper layers of the medium, the upper dashed line
in Fig. 6 (bottom) denotes the column density at which
the ﬁrst thermal instability and temperature drop occur.
At these column densities, there is a slight kink in the pro-
ﬁle of the pressure ratio. At the second occurrence of the
thermal instability, when crossing the lower dashed line, an
upturn of the proﬁle can be seen. This behavior is very sim-
ilar to the one described by Gonçalves et al. (2007) albeit
for a diﬀerent model setup. In the present work we ﬁnd the
high temperature instability at Prad/Pgas ∼ 11.5 for the
uniformly hot and Prad/Pgas ∼ 13.3 for the uniformly cold
solutions. The low temperature instability is triggered at
Prad/Pgas ∼ 9.6 and Prad/Pgas ∼ 10.6 for the hot and cold
solutions, respectively. For more details on the nature of the
thermal instability and its relation to the net cooling func-
tions we refer the reader to the analysis in Gonçalves et al.
(2007).

In contrast to the two instability drops in the theoretical
proﬁles, the observed AMD in Fig. 1 only shows one “for-

bidden range” at 2.8 × 104 − 1.1 × 105 K. This zone can be
associated to the second, low-temperature drop obtained in
the modeling. The resolution of the observed AMD is not
high enough to constrain the temperature proﬁle more pre-
cisely, but the depression of the AMD at T > 106 K may be
related to the high temperature drop seen in the models.

The maximum temperature at the irradiated side is
about the same for both the cold and the hot solution of a
given ξtot, which is consistent with the fact that this region
is thermally stable (see discussion below). A similar argu-
ment holds true for the lowest temperature values at the far
side of the slab, where the medium is thermally stable as
well. The maximum temperature of 2.4×106 K derived from
the observed AMD is found between those obtained with
the models of ξtot = 4000 and ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1,
while the minimum temperature value of 1.5 × 104 K is
slightly lower than those reached in all models. These low
temperatures are constrained by the low ionization species
such as Fe I–XVI, whose lines constitute the so-called UTA
features.

In Fig. 5, we also show the observational temperature
proﬁle obtained from the latest AMD analysis presented in
Sect. 3. It suggests an ionization parameter slightly below
4000 ergs cm s−1, which is a bit low with respect to the
result obtained from our comparison with the observed col-
umn densities in Sect. 5.2. The discrepancy is less strong
for the cold solution, which again seems to be the preferred
thermal mode of the medium.

We want to point out here, though, that the compari-
son of the observed temperature proﬁle resulting from the
AMD analysis with the modeling from titan is not entirely
straightforward. The observed temperature proﬁle was ob-
tained by ﬁtting the absorption lines of various ions as-
suming only absorption but no reemission eﬀects inside the
medium. As described in Holczer et al. (2007), the frac-
tional ionic abundances that are needed for the AMD anal-
ysis are computed by xstar (Kallman & Bautista 2001)
assuming a spherical geometry whereas here we apply ti-
tan in plane-parallel geometry. Also the dependence of the
ionic fractions with the ionization parameter is obtained as-
suming optically thin shells illuminated with the same inci-
dent spectrum, thus neglecting its distortion when passing
through the medium. The diﬀerences in the two radiative
transfer methods partly explain the discrepancies between
the observational temperature proﬁle and our modeling re-
sults.

5.4. Comparison with the observed AMD

Finally, we attempt to reproduce the observed AMD of
NGC 3783 given in Sect. 3. We construct a theoretical AMD
from our modeling making use of the radiation to gas pres-
sure ratio P ion
as a function of the cumulative hydrogen-
equivalent column density NH inside the medium. This ratio
is related to the local ionization parameter ξ and tempera-
ture T :

Fig. 6. Fractional ion abundances of iron as a function of the hydrogen column density inside the warm absorber medium for the
two hot modeling cases of ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1 (top-left) and ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1 (top-right). For ξtot = 8000, the origin of
the horizontal scale is at 4.1×1022 for easier comparison with the case of ξtot = 4000 plot (see text). The ratio between radiative
and gas pressure for the uniformly hot (bottom-left) and cold (bottom-right) solutions are shown using the same color codes as in
Fig. 5. The horizontal, dashed lines mark the pressure ratios at which the two thermal instabilities occur.

Krolik et al. (1981). In contrast to the pressure ratio dis-
cussed in Sect. 5.3 and shown in Fig. 6 (bottom), the radia-
rad is based only on the ionizing ﬂux between
tion pressure P ion
1 and 1000 Ryd, and not integrated over the full spectral
range. We point out that outside the interval of 1–1000 Ryd
absorption processes are much less important than electron
scattering. Therefore P ion
rad and Prad evolve very similarly as
a function of the medium temperature but have a diﬀerent
normalization. The values on the right hand side of equa-
tion (9) are computed by titan as a function of NH. In
this way, the relation between NH and log ξ can be estab-
lished and then diﬀerentiated to construct a model AMD
as deﬁned in equation (1).

We prefer to plot the AMD as a function of the tem-
perature rather than the ionization parameter. A relation
between T and ξ is easily found because both values are
computed as a function of NH by titan. This way we min-
imize possible systematic diﬀerences between the observed
and theoretical AMD that are related to the calculation
of the ionization parameter. In the observational analysis

using xstar a medium in spherical geometry at constant
density is assumed and radiative processes are considered
only along the radial direction. For the model computations
with titan we assume a plane-parallel atmosphere in pres-
sure equilibrium and conduct full radiative transfer calcula-
tions for multiple directions. Furthermore, xstar includes a
lot more spectral lines in the radiative transfer than titan
does. Such systematics lead to diﬀerences in the proﬁles of
ξ(T ) inside the medium. Rescaling the model AMD back to
the temperature proﬁle partly mitigates these eﬀects.

On the other hand, we mention that additional physi-
cal processes such as thermal conduction are not included
in titan while they may be present in the warm absorber
and their eﬀect might explain part of the discrepancy be-
tween the observational and the theoretical AMD. The
whole cloud being in pressure equilibrium and moving uni-
formly, no strong dynamical shocks are expected to be
formed, though. Turbulence might induce shocks, but all
observed X-ray lines are reproduced with pure photoion-
ization without any signature of collisional plasma. We also

Fig. 7. Comparison between the observed and the modeled AMD as a function of temperature inside the medium (see Sect. 3).
We construct theoretical AMD curves for the cold (left) and hot (right) solutions of the cases ξtot = 4000 (green) and ξtot = 8000
(blue). The observational AMD is denoted by the dashed line. The botom panels show the same theoretical AMDs as above but
degraded to the resolution of the observed AMD and plotted on a larger vertical scale.

We show the theoretical and observed AMDs

note that in the well-studied Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC 1068
the warm absorber medium is supposedly seen from the
side and Kinkhabwala et al. (2002) did not ﬁnd a tempera-
ture structure that would indicate additinal shock heating.
in
Fig. 7 (top) for the cold and hot solutions of ξtot =
4000 ergs cm s−1 (green points) and ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1
(blue points), these models being favored when compared
to the observed ionic column densities (see Sect. 5.2). Al-
though the resolution of the observational AMD is quite
low, it is in rough agreement with the theoretical curves.
The comparison of the normalization is more satisfactory
at lower temperature. Observational and theoretical AMD
both show a gap around 105 K but in the model AMD a sec-
ond gap is detected between 3 × 105 K and 106 K. The two
gaps correspond to the steep decrease in the temperature
proﬁles discussed in Sect. 5.3.

The steep branch in the middle block of the AMD for the
hot solution (Fig. 7, right) is directly related to the rapid
change in negative slope of the corresponding temperature
proﬁle (see Fig.5, dashed lines). The “triangular” shape seen
in the middle block of the cold solution is associated to the
changing sign of the corresponding temperature slope (see
Fig.5, solid lines).

Also, compared to the observational AMD the low tem-
perature instability strip found in the modeling is slightly
shifted by a factor of 2 or less towards higher tempera-
tures. This behavior is also visible in Fig. 5, as the vertical
drop of the observational temperature proﬁle (dashed line)
is shifted downward compared to the temperature proﬁles
for ξtot = 4000 and ξtot = 8000 models.

This may again be related to the diﬀerent methods and
assumptions for the radiative transfer applied in the obser-
vational and theoretical determinations of the AMD. For in-
stance, we recall the diﬀerence between the local theoretical
ξ value derived from the pressure ratio and the ionization
parameter used to construct the AMD which is computed
based on the same spectral shape (the incident spectrum)
whatever is the position of the associated dominant ion in-
side the cloud. Also physical processes like thermal conduc-
tion are not included in our model computations while they
may induce changes by a few percent at the location of the
discontinuities (Czerny et al. 2009); this eﬀect would not
yet explain the complete shift in the horizontal direction.

The fact that the observational AMD does not show
the high-temperature drop may be real or simply due to its
limited resolution. The bottom panels in Fig. 7 show the
theoretical AMD degraded to the same resolution as for

the observed AMD. For the two cold solutions (left), the
second gap is still present while the ﬁrst one is no more vis-
ible as the observational gap is now ﬁlled. The agreement
is better for the hot solutions (right panel), where for both
ionization parameters the disappearance of the high tem-
perature gap occurs but the low observational gap is partly
ﬁlled up. Nonetheless, the theoretical AMDs reproduce the
normalization of the observed ones to a large extent, al-
though the two AMDs are built for diﬀerent physical and
geometrical conﬁgurations. They are thus complementary:
the observational AMD gives a ﬁrst idea of the presence
of thermal instabilities in the cloud and thus justiﬁes the
use of sophisticated codes to model the observations un-
der more suitable physical conditions than simple constant
density models.

In parallel to the work presented here, thermal instabil-
ity and the absorption measure distribution was modeled
for Mrk 509 with titan (Adhikari et al. 2015). Despite a
diﬀerent spectral energy distribution that is injected into
the warm absorber of Mrk 509, thermal instability ranges
occur and are associated to forbidden temperature ranges
of the AMD. The discussion in Adhikari et al. (2015) about
the impact of physical parameters and diﬀerent numerical
schemes applied to compute the radiative transfer extends
the pioneering work by Różańska et al. (2006). Drawing
similar conclusions, these works are insightful and comple-
mentary to what is presented here.

6. Discussion

The ionic column densities derived from the Chandra ob-
servation Ni,obs are in qualitative agreement with the theo-
retical values, Ni,mod, obtained for diﬀerent models except
for the case of ξtot = 2000 ergs cm s−1 (see Fig. 3). A
more quantitative comparison leads to a satisfying agree-
ment for ξtot values between 4000 and 8000 ergs cm s−1
with a preference for the cold over the hot solutions in the
instability ranges. The models can account remarkably well
for the ionic species at low and high ionization degrees. Dif-
ferences are yet expected, since the Ni,obs values are aﬀected
by line emission partly ﬁlling up the absorption lines. Fur-
thermore, the available atomic data keep evolving and are
still subject to uncertainties which may aﬀect the analysis
(Kallman & Palmeri 2007). The ions from Fe IV to Fe VIII
having a large uncertainty, they have been excluded from
the comparison.

6.1. Variability aspects of the warm absorber

The Chandra mean spectrum is composed of six separate
observations spanned over one year and a half. Netzer et al.
(2003) have reported the softness ratio versus the 2–10 keV
ﬂux for each of the six pointings. Four observations show
low softness ratios (0.06–0.14) and are characterized by a
low ﬂux level of 3–6×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, while the two re-
maining observations show high softness ratios (0.14–0.23)
with ﬂuxes covering the range of 4–7.5×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1.
The two ﬂux ranges overlap, but according to Netzer et al.
(2003) the four low-softness observations can be associated
to a low state (LS) and the two remaining to a high state
(HS). For the following discussion we consider the same
scheme bearing in mind that Krongold et al. (2003) chose
a diﬀerent grouping to deﬁne high and low state spectra.

Article number, page 12 of 15

The four low and soft state observations cover 666 ks and,
as expected, the 900 ks average Chandra spectrum has a
continuum shape (softness = 0.092) that is in better agree-
ment with the LS than with the HS. The mean ﬂux level
over 2–10 Å changes at most by a factor of 2 between the
six observations.

Netzer et al. (2003) could not assign the two ﬂux states
to a change in luminosity and ionization parameter; an
additional soft component is required to account for the
high state spectrum. In the framework of the modeling
presented here, the question arises whether the two states
can be identiﬁed by the two cold and hot solutions of a
model in pressure equilibrium that otherwise is character-
ized by the same ionization parameter and column den-
sity. Besides the transition between the two hot and cold
solutions should occur on thermal timescales of the order
of a few weeks/months (see equation 4 in Chevallier et al.
2007). This is indeed achievable with the parameter values
considered in the modeling of Gonçalves et al. (2007) and
Chevallier et al. (2007).

We have produced the two solution spectra for a set of
(ξtot, N 0
H) values. The spectrum corresponding to the hot
solution is systematically softer, as expected if low ioniza-
tion lines such as the UTA are weaker or absent, but the
ﬂux below 10 Å is almost constant (varies by less than 10%)
and thus this can hardly account for a ﬂux ratio HS/LS in-
creasing regularly from 1.3 at 3 Å to 1.8 at 10 Å (see Fig.9
Netzer et al. 2003).

We also investigated the possibility of a change of ξtot,
H and choosing the cold (hot) solu-
keeping a constant N 0
tion for the higher (lower) ξtot value. Without investigat-
ing an exhaustive, time-consuming grid of models, we can
ﬁnd a couple of solutions. For N 0
H = 6 × 1022 cm−2, the
ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1 (cold) and ξtot = 11300 ergs cm s−1
(hot) solutions correspond to softness ratios of 0.10 and 0.17
in agreement with the two observed softness states and dif-
fering in ﬂux by a factor 1.6 in the range 2-10 Å, also in
agreement with both states.

In conclusion, we ﬁnd that the two states cannot be sim-
ply associated with the two extreme stable solutions present
in an isobaric RPC wind. Assuming the same column den-
sity, an increase of the ionization parameter is also required
to account for the high/soft state transition.

Shorter temporal variability within a few days has also
been investigated in NGC 3783 (see, e.g., Markowitz 2005;
Summons et al. 2007; Reis et al. 2012). Using broad en-
ergy range observations with Suzaku, Reis et al. (2012) con-
cluded that while the emission of the central region changes,
the warm absorber does not vary with time or ﬂux. This
is consistent with the fact that the medium would respond
to the incident ﬂux change with a timescale of the thermal
instability typically longer than a few days.

6.2. Reproducing the observed AMD with an isobaric RPC

model

The theoretical temperature proﬁles we obtain exhibit two
sharp drops (Fig. 5). Their extensions are very similar
for all ξtot and whatever thermal solution chosen (hot or
cold). Based on the ratio of radiation and gas pressure (see
Sect. 5.3), we constructed an AMD curve for the models
and compared them to the observed one. The latter gives a
total column density N 0
H and temperature ranges in rough

Goosmann et al.: The thermal instability of the warm absorber in NGC 3783

agreement with those derived for the best model solutions.
However, while the AMD level is similar for both curves,
only one drop is apparent in the observed AMD and its
position roughly agrees with the second (cooler) drop pro-
duced in the modeled AMD. The agreement is better for
the hot solution.

According to equation (1), the AMD is the gradient of
NH with ionization parameter along the line-of-sight. In the
instability strips this gradient falls to zero, but in between
the instability regions the AMD measures how “fast” the
column density falls oﬀ over a given range of ionization
parameter or temperature where the medium is thermally
stable. The successful reproduction of the observed AMD
by our modeling thus gives a rather detailed insight into
the thermal proﬁle of the warm absorber.

see also Sect. 6.3). A factor may also be that in the present
model the full radiative transfer was computed on relatively
small spatial scales.

Using cloudy in the RCP hypothesis, Stern et al.
(2014b) do not always ﬁnd temperature discontinuities in
their models. The observational gap around ξ = 20 present
in the AMD of all 6 sources analyzed in their paper is indeed
not reproduced by any of their models, while it is produced
with titan, which uses a ﬁne adaptive grid to deﬁne more
precisely the position and steepness of the discontinuities.
The exact conditions for the instability to occur remain to
be constrained and also require a comparison between dif-
ferent radiative transfer methods. Such a study is beyond
the scope of this paper. Here, we only state that the warm
absorber of NGC 3783 can be modeled as a thermally un-
stable RPC wind that is in agreement with the observed
shape of the AMD.

6.3. Constant density versus RPC winds

In previous spectral analyses of the warm absorber in
NGC 3783, a number of two (Krongold et al. 2003) or three
clouds (Netzer et al. 2003) were invoked to reproduce the
long-look Chandra observation. In both analyses the in-
dividual absorbers were found to be in pressure equilib-
rium. Here we demonstrate that a medium in pressure
equilibrium, i.e., imposing a constant sum of gas and ra-
diative pressure, reproduces the spectral shape and the
ionic column densities measured for the warm absorber
of NGC 3783. In Fig. 6 (bottom) we report the ratio of
the radiative to gas pressure versus the integrated col-
umn density for the favored (cold and hot) solutions of
ξtot. One can derive from the Fig. 6 (bottom) showing
Prad/Pgas = Ptot/Pgas − 1 that the radiative pressure dom-
inates almost across the entire slab and is nearly constant
except at the very far side where it drops sharply. This is
in good agreement with the assumption of a RPC wind as
discussed in Baskin et al. (2014) and Stern et al. (2014a,b).
For all titan models at pressure equilibrium obtained
for this study, two regions of the slab turn out to be ther-
mally unstable, which oﬀers two possible temperature solu-
tions, a hot and a cold one. We chose to keep the same kind
of solution for all instability regions in the entire slab. This
way we compute physical limits to the possible range of
thermal states the medium can adopt. The sharp drops oc-
curring twice in the temperature proﬁles are due to the ap-
pearance (disappearance) of an additional stable solution at
left (right) of the net cooling function (see Gonçalves et al.
2007). These drops are intrinsically linked to the existence
of thermal instabilities. The work by Hess et al. (1997) and
Chakravorty et al. (2008, 2009, 2012) has underlined the
importance of the irradiating continuum shape, chemical
abundance and the atomic data for the occurrence of ther-
mal instabilities. For the continuum of NGC 3783, which
corresponds to an optical-to-X-ray slope αox ∼ 1.3 and
α = 0.77 (we refer to these papers for the deﬁnition of these
slopes), Chakravorty et al. (2009) obtained an unstable re-
gion for ξ being in the range of 50–1200 ergs cm s−1, while
Krolik & Kriss (2001) found a stability curve with a near
vertical rise and stable solutions for the same range of ξ
values. From these comparisons, we have again to conclude
that the occurrence of thermal instability in a given model
setup is very sensitive not only to the parameterization but
also to the computational method adopted.

There is no clear indication that the drop of the AMD at
higher temperature is apparent in the data. The low resolu-
tion (7 points only) of the observed AMD may explain part
of the discrepancy, as well as the diﬀerent radiative transfer
methods implemented in xstar and in titan as mentioned
in Sect. 5.3. Nevertheless, our combined observational and
modeling work excludes for NGC 3783 a so-called “contin-
uous AMD” that corresponds to a homogeneous ﬂow and
is observed in, e.g., NGC 5548 (Steenbrugge et al. 2005).
In Behar (2009) the AMD of ﬁve AGN are reported in-
cluding NGC 3783; all of them have a gap at intermediate
ξ values. A discrete AMD is also reported for NGC 7469
(Blustin et al. 2007), MCG-6-30-15 (Holczer et al. 2010)
and NGC 3516 (Holczer & Behar 2012). Again, in almost
all cases a gap is detected, which is consistent with a multi-
zone absorber.

Behar (2009) ﬁt the observed AMD proﬁles and derived
the power law index α for a density proﬁle of the wind on
small scales, n(δr) ∝ δr−α, or on large scales, n(r) ∝ r−α.
Herein, n and r denote the hydrogen-equivalent number
density and the distance from the ionizing source, respec-
tively. The approach relies on a self-similar density struc-
ture and the geometrical dilution of the irradiation ﬂux.
The slight rise of the observed AMD for NGC 3783 implies
indexes of α = 0.78 ± 0.07 on small and α = 1.22 ± 0.07 on
large scales. These results imply that the hydrogen number
density in the wind falls oﬀ with distance from the irradiat-
ing source which is in agreement with MHD models where
a dependence n ∝ r−1 results from the large scale proﬁle of
the magnetic ﬁeld.
The situation changes for RPC winds. Stern et al.
(2014a) and Stern et al. (2014b) compute theoretical AMD
proﬁles of a RPC warm absorber using the code cloudy
and show that for a broad range of model parameters the
AMD has a ﬂat distribution as observed. The density pro-
ﬁle in RPC winds rises together with the gas pressure as
a function of the distance to the ionizing source, which is
what we also obtain in our modeling of NGC 3783 with ti-
tan. This supports the hypothesis that the warm absorber
is conﬁned by radiation pressure.

With respect to the broad analysis of Stern et al.
(2014a), Stern et al. (2014b), the present modeling of
NGC 3783 assumed a more complex shape of the incident
spectrum. This may play a role for the presence of ther-
mal instability regimes. Still, in the modeling of isobaric
RPC winds done by Gonçalves et al. (2007), the incident
power law is of a rather simple shape and produces ther-
mal instabilities, while for various other incident spectra
no instabilities are observed (,e.g., Chakravorty et al. 2012,

7. Summary and conclusions

Following a combined observational and modeling ap-
proach we studied the warm absorber of the Seyfert galaxy
NGC 3783. We simultaneously reproduce diﬀerent obser-
vational characteristics by doing detailed radiative transfer
modeling inside an isobaric RPC wind.

1. The continuum shape of the long 900 ks Chandra
spectrum can be correctly described using a photo-
ionization model of a RPC medium at constant to-
tal (gas+radiation) pressure. We obtain a range of so-
lutions for pairs of the ionization parameter ξtot and
the total column density N 0
H. These results extend pre-
vious analyses conducted in Gonçalves et al. (2006),
Gonçalves et al. (2007) and Goosmann et al. (2009) to
higher values of the incident ionization parameter, up-
dated element abundances and additional spectral lines
introduced in the titan code.

2. Having ﬁxed most input parameters of our modeling
from various observational constraints, we reproduce
the observed distribution of ionic column densities for a
range of ionization parameters. The degeneracy in ξtot
can by broken by a more quantitative analysis that in-
dicates a range of ξtot = 4000− 8000 ergs cm s−1. In the
instability regime, the medium is more likely to adopt
the cold rather than the hot phase.

3. We construct model AMDs for ξtot = 4000 ergs cm s−1
and ξtot = 8000 ergs cm s−1 that are in agreement with
the overall shape of the observed AMD for both the
hot and cold solutions. The model AMDs show two in-
stability bands with the low-energy instability approxi-
mately agreeing with the one drop seen in the observed
AMD. Note, however, that these temperature gaps are
partly ﬁlled when plotting the theoretical AMDs using
the same rough temperature sampling as for the obser-
vational AMD.

This work gives further support to the hypothesis that
the warm absorber in Seyfert galaxies is a RPC wind. Mod-
eling with titan the radiative transfer inside the warm
absorber of NGC 3783, it was possible to reproduce a
whole range of observational features simultaneously. This
includes the presence of a thermally unstable regime seen
in the observed AMD. As several AGN have exhibited at
least one gap in their observed AMD (see Sec. 6.2), it is
tantalizing to extend the present work to other objects in
order to have a more physical description of their warm ab-
sorber. This has already been started in parallel work to
ours presented by Adhikari et al. (2015). It is likely that
the occurrence of the thermal instability under the condi-
tion of pressure balance depends not only on the assumed
physics but also on the computational details of the adopted
modeling method. The spatial scale on which the radiative
transfer is solved may play a role, too. This needs to be
explored in more detail in the future.
