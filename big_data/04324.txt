PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON

SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

Abstract. We investigate properties of ﬁnite subgroups G < SL(n, k)
for which the skew-group algebra R#G does not have a grading structure
of preprojective algebra. Namely, we prove that if a ﬁnite subgroup G <
SL(n, k) is conjugate to a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), then
the skew-group algebra R#G is not Morita equivalent to an (higher) pre-
projective algebra. This is related to the fact that the tensor product of
two Koszul preprojective algebras does not admit a preprojective algebra
grading. Along the way, we give a quiver construction for the prepro-
jective algebra over a Koszul n-representation-inﬁnite algebra, and show
that it has a superpotential and that it is a derivation-quotient algebra.

1. Introduction

Preprojective algebras were ﬁrst deﬁned by Gel′fand and Ponomarev in
[GP79] to study the representation theory of ﬁnite-dimensional hereditary
algebras. Baer, Geigle and Lenzing ([BGL87]) later proposed an equivalent
deﬁnition for the preprojective algebra as a tensor algebra over Λ of the
inverse Auslander-Reiten translation:

Π(Λ) := TΛExt1

Λ(DΛ, Λ).

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

In the setting of Iyama’s program of higher-dimensional Auslander-Reiten
theory, this construction was generalized to algebras of higher global dimen-
sion. They are characterized by the following homological property: the
(higher) preprojective algebras over (n − 1)-representation-inﬁnite algebras
are exactly the bimodule n-Calabi-Yau algebras of Gorenstein parameter 1
([Kel11], [MM11], [HIO14], [AIR15]).

When G < SL(2, k) is a ﬁnite group, Reiten and Van den Bergh ([RVdB89])
proved that the skew-group algebra k[x, y]#G is Morita equivalent to the pre-
projective algebra over an extended Coxeter-Dynkin quiver associated to G
via the McKay correspondence, creating yet another bridge between repre-
sentation theory and the study of quotient singularities. Now if G < SL(n, k)
and R is the polynomial ring in n variables, we are interested in determin-
ing when is R#G Morita equivalent to an higher preprojective algebra. In
[AIR15], the authors showed that if G is cyclic and satisﬁes an extra condi-
tion, then R#G is isomorphic to an n-preprojective algebra. In this paper,
we prove a partial converse to this statement and generalize it to ﬁnite sub-
groups of SL(n, k).

The study of this question naturally leads to the analysis of the preprojec-
tive structure of the tensor product of two preprojective algebras. In [HIO14],
the authors showed that the tensor product of two higher representation-
inﬁnite algebras is again higher representation-inﬁnite. This raises the ques-
tion whether the same is true for the tensor product of preprojective algebras.
In this paper, we show that such algebras, with an additional Koszulity as-
sumption, cannot be endowed with a grading as required for a preprojective
algebra.

Both our results rely on the fact that if we ﬁnd a grading on these algebras
such that they are bimodule n-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1, then
we force the degree 0 part to be inﬁnite-dimensional.

The objects of interest in this paper are Koszul preprojective algebras.
We generalize the quiver construction of classical preprojective algebras to
higher Koszul preprojective algebras. Moreover, we show that the preprojec-
tive algebra over a Koszul n-representation-inﬁnite algebra has a superpo-
tential and is given by a derivation-quotient algebra, described in [BSW10],
generalizing a theorem by Keller ([Kel11]) which states that 3-preprojective
algebras are Jacobian algebras given by a potential.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we recall background
material on higher preprojective algebras. We also deﬁne Koszul algebras and
recall the notion of a superpotential, described in [BSW10], that plays an
important role in the grading structure of the algebras we consider. In section
3, we give an explicit construction of the quiver of a basic preprojective
algebra, generalizing the quiver construction in the classical case. We then
prove that the preprojective algebra Π(Λ) over a n-representation-inﬁnite
Koszul algebra Λ is a derivation-quotient algebra with quadratic relations.

In section 4, we ﬁrst describe the superpotential of a tensor product of two
Koszul bimodule Calabi-Yau algebras. We then use it to show that the
tensor product of two Koszul preprojective algebras cannot have a structure
of preprojective algebra. In section 5, we apply these results to skew-group
algebras, generalizing a partial converse to a theorem in [AIR15]. We show
that if a ﬁnite subgroup G < SL(n, k) is conjugate to a ﬁnite subgroup of
SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k) for some n1, n2 ≥ 1 such that n1 + n2 = n, then R#G
is not Morita equivalent to a preprojective algebra.

Notation. We let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0. Every
algebra is a connected k-algebra, that is, it cannot be written as a product of
two algebras. We denote by D := Homk(−, k) the k-dual. If A is a k-algebra,
we denote by Ae := A ⊗k Aop the enveloping algebra.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Higher Preprojective algebras. Let Λ be a ﬁnite-dimensional alge-

bra of ﬁnite global dimension. Let S := DΛ
⊗Λ − be the Serre functor in
the bounded derived category of ﬁnitely-generated left Λ-modules Db(Λ) and
denote by Sn the composition Sn := S◦[−n]. The inverse of the Serre functor
is given by S−1 = RHomΛ(DΛ, −).

L

Deﬁnition 1 ([HIO14]). Let Λ be a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra of global
dimension n. We say that Λ is n-representation-inﬁnite if

for any l ≥ 0.

S−l
n (Λ) ∈ mod Λ

By deﬁnition, S−l

n (Λ) is a complex, so the condition means that it has only

cohomology in degree 0. This cohomology is then necessarily equal to

Extn

Λ(DΛ, Λ)⊗Λl.

Deﬁnition 2 (See, e.g., [HIO14]). Let Λ be an n-representation-inﬁnite
algebra. The (n + 1)-preprojective algebra of Λ is deﬁned as the tensor
algebra

Π(Λ) = TΛExtn

Λ(DΛ, Λ) ∼=Ml≥0

S−l
n (Λ).

These notions generalize the concepts of representation-inﬁnite algebras

and of preprojective algebras for algebras of higher global dimension.

4

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

Deﬁnition 3. Let B be a positively graded k-algebra. We say that B is
(bimodule) n-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter a if B ∈ per Be, the thick
subcategory of D(Mod Be) generated by Be, and there exists a bounded
graded projective B-bimodule resolution P• of B and an isomorphism

where (−)∨ = HomBe(−, Be).

P• ∼= P ∨

• [n](−a),

We call an algebra (bimodule) n-Calabi-Yau if it satisﬁes the previous

homological property, forgetting the grading.

Theorem 1 ([Kel11], [MM11], [HIO14], [AIR15]). There is a one-to-one
correspondence between isomorphism classes of n-representation-inﬁnite al-
gebras Λ and isomorphism classes of bimodule (n + 1)-Calabi-Yau algebras
B of Gorenstein parameter 1 such that B0 is ﬁnite-dimensional, given by

Λ 7→ Π(Λ)
B0 ←[ B

In this paper, we reserve the term representation-inﬁnite algebra to ﬁnite-
dimensional algebras and the term preprojective algebra for (higher) prepro-
jective algebras over ﬁnite-dimensional algebras. When we use the concept
of bimodule Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1, we do not necessarily
require the degree 0 part to be ﬁnite-dimensional.

2.2. Koszul algebras. We describe Koszul algebras, following mostly [BGS96].
Throughout this subsection, we let A be a positively graded k-algebra such
that S := A0 is a ﬁnite-dimensional semisimple algebra. All tensor products
are over S.

Deﬁnition 4. The algebra A is Koszul
A-module, admits a graded projective resolution

if S, considered as a left graded

· · · → P 2 → P 1 → P 0 → S → 0

such that P l is generated in degree l.

It is well-known that any Koszul algebra is quadratic, that is, it is given

by a tensor algebra

TSV /hM i,

where V is a S-bimodule placed in degree 1 and M is a S-bimodule such
that M ⊂ V ⊗ V .

Deﬁnition 5. The Koszul complex is described as

· · · → P n → P n−1 → · · · → P 0 → 0,

where each P l is given by

A ⊗\µ

(V ⊗µ ⊗ M ⊗ V ⊗l−µ−2) ⊂ A ⊗ V ⊗l

and the diﬀerentials are the restrictions of the maps

A ⊗ V ⊗l → A ⊗ V ⊗(l−1),

given by

a ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl 7→ av1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

We denote Tµ(V ⊗µ ⊗ M ⊗ V ⊗l−µ−2) by Kl.

Theorem 2 (see, e.g., [BGS96]). Let A = TSV hM i be a quadratic algebra.
Then A is Koszul if and only if the Koszul complex is a projective left A-
module resolution of S.

In this case, the Koszul resolution is a subresolution of the Bar resolution

β(A, S) of S:

β(A, S) := · · · → A ⊗ A⊗n

+ → A ⊗ A⊗(n−1)

+

→ · · · → A,

with diﬀerentials given by

1 ⊗ (a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an) 7→ a1 ⊗ (a2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an)
(−1)l1 ⊗ (a1 ⊗ · · · al−1 ⊗ alal+1 ⊗ al+2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an).

+ X1≤l≤n−1

We note that

Kl

∼= TorA

l (S, S).

The Koszul resolution also gives rise to a projective A-bimodule resolution

of A:

· · · → P n → P n−1 → · · · → P 0 → A → 0,

where each P l is given by

A ⊗\µ

(V ⊗µ ⊗ M ⊗ V ⊗l−µ−2) ⊗ A ⊂ A ⊗ V ⊗l ⊗ A

and the diﬀerentials are the restrictions of the maps

A ⊗ V ⊗l ⊗ A → A ⊗ V ⊗(l−1) ⊗ A,

given by
a ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl ⊗ a′ 7→ av1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl ⊗ a′ + (−1)la ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl−1 ⊗ vla′.
Remark 1. In this paper, we deal in general with two gradings. The ﬁrst one
is the natural grading coming from the tensor algebra structure

A = TSV /hM i.

We consider Koszul algebras with respect to this grading. If A is Calabi-Yau
of Gorenstein parameter 1, then we have a second grading on A giving this
property. In particular, when A is a preprojective algebra, this grading is
given by the natural grading structure on the tensor algebra

A = TΛExtn

Λ(DΛ, Λ).

2.3. Superpotentials. Let A = TSV /hM i be a k-algebra, where S is a
semisimple ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra, and V and M are S-bimodule. We
describe the notion of a superpotential, following [BSW10]. In this section,
all tensor products are over S.

Let Sl be the symmetric group. Let an element σ ∈ Sl act on

vl ⊗ vl−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ∈ V ⊗l

by permuting the indices, that is,

σ(vl ⊗ vl−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1) := vσ−1(l) ⊗ vσ−1(l−1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vσ−1(1),

and extend this action linearly.

6

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

Deﬁnition 6 ([BSW10]). A superpotential of degree n is an element ω of
degree n in TSV that commutes with the S-action:

sω = ωs ∀s ∈ S,

and have the property that σ(ω) = ω, where σ = (1 2 · · · n − 1 n) in Sn.
We say that ω is super-cyclically symmetric.

Deﬁnition 7 ([BSW10]). The derivation-quotient algebra of ω of order l is
deﬁned as

D(ω, l) := TSV /hWn−li,

where Wn−l is generated by elements of the form δpω, where p = vl ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1
is an element of order l in TSV and δp : V ⊗n → V ⊗n−l is a linear map
deﬁned as

δpv :=(cid:26) r

0 else.

if v = p ⊗ r

Consider the complex W• :=

0 → A ⊗ Wn ⊗ A d−→ A ⊗ Wn−1 ⊗ A d−→ · · · d−→ A ⊗ W1 ⊗ A d−→ A ⊗ W0 ⊗ A → 0,

where the diﬀerential d : A ⊗ Wl ⊗ A → A ⊗ Wl−1 ⊗ A is given by

d(a ⊗ vl ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ a′)

= ǫl(avl ⊗ vl−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ a′ + (−1)la ⊗ vl ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2 ⊗ v1a′),

where

ǫl :=(cid:26) (−1)l(n−l)

1

if l < (n + 1)/2
else.

For any superpotential, this complex is self-dual, leading to a Calabi-Yau
property. Moreover, it is a subcomplex of the Koszul complex for D(ω, n−2).

Theorem 3 ([BSW10]). Let A = TSV /hM i. Then A is a n-Calabi-Yau
Koszul algebra if and only if A ∼= D(ω, n − 2), for some superpotential ω of
degree n, and W• is exact in positive degree with H 0(W•) = A. Moreover,
in this case, ω is a S-bimodule generator of Kn ∼= Wn.

3. Quiver construction of Preprojective algebras

The goal of this section is to generalize the quiver construction of 2-
preprojective algebras to higher preprojective algebras over basic Koszul
n-representation-inﬁnite algebras.

Theorem 4 ([Rin98], [CB99]). Let Q = (Q0, Q1) be a quiver with no oriented
cycles and consider its path algebra kQ. For each arrow a : i → j ∈ Q1,
deﬁne a∗ : j → i. Consider ˜Q = (Q0, ˜Q1), where ˜Q1 contains all the arrows
a of Q1 as well as the new arrows a∗. Then, the preprojective algebra of kQ
is given by

Π(kQ) ∼= k ˜Q/(Xa∈Q1

[a, a∗]),

where [a, a∗] is deﬁned as aa∗ − a∗a.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

7

In this section, we let Λ = TSV /hM i be a basic Koszul n-representation-
inﬁnite algebra, where S is a ﬁnite-dimensional semisimple k-algebra, V an
S-bimodule and M ⊂ V ⊗S V . Let Π be a (n + 1)-preprojective algebra over
Λ. Then Π is given by

Π = TΛExtn(DΛ, Λ) ∼= TΛExtn

Λe(Λ, Λe).

The following is inspired by techniques employed in [CB99]. From [Hap89],

we know that the Koszul bimodule resolution of Λ is given by

0 → Mp:i→j

f

−→ Mp:i→j

Λej ⊗k eiΛ

Λej ⊗k eiΛ → · · · → Λ ⊗S Λ → Λ → 0,

p∈Kn

p∈Kn−1

where Kl is the S-bimodule deﬁned in subsection 2.2, for 0 ≤ l ≤ n.
If
p = vn ⊗ vn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2 ⊗ v1 is a path from i to j, and p1 = vn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1
is a path from i to j′ and p2 : vn ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2 is a path from i′ to j, then f is
deﬁned as follows:

f ((ej ⊗ ei)p) = (vnej ′ ⊗ ei)p1 + (−1)n(ej ⊗ ei′v1)p2.

We extend this deﬁnition linearly. This is the usual diﬀerential in the Koszul
resolution.

Applying HomΛe(−, Λe), we obtain a complex ending as follow:

HomΛe( Mp:i→j

p∈Kn−1

Λej ⊗k eiΛ, Λe)

˜f

−→ HomΛe(Mp:i→j

p∈Kn

Λej ⊗k eiΛ, Λe) → 0,

where ˜f (φ) := φ ◦ f . In general, if Ω is a Λ-bimodule, then

HomΛe(Λej ⊗k eiΛ, Ω) ∼= ejΩei

φ 7→ φ(ej ⊗ ei)

φm : (bej ⊗ eib′ 7→ beimejb′) ←[ ejmei

Thus, taking Ω = Λe, we get that

HomΛe(Mp:i→j

Λej ⊗k eiΛ, Λe) ∼= Mp:i→j

Λei ⊗k ejΛ.

Therefore,

p∈Kl

p∈Kl

Extn

Λe(Λ, Λe) ∼= Mp:i→j

We can view the Λ-bimodule

Λei ⊗k ejΛ

p∈Kn

as a space of arrows going from j → i for every path p : i → j in Kn.

We now describe Im ˜f . We have the following chain of isomorphisms:

Mp:i→j

Theorem 7. Let Λ = TSV /hM i be a basic n-representation-inﬁnite algebra
and Π be the preprojective algebra over Λ. If Π is Koszul, then Λ is Koszul.
As a partial converse, if Λ is Koszul, then Π ∼= D(ω, (n + 1) − 2) for some
superpotential ω.

Proof. Suppose that Π is Koszul. Consider its Koszul resolution

0 → Π ⊗S ˜Kn+1 ⊗S Π → Π ⊗S ˜Kn ⊗S Π · · · → Π ⊗S Π → Π → 0.

Taking the preprojective degree 0 part of this resolution, we get a complex

0 → Λ ⊗S Kn ⊗S Λ → · · · → Λ ⊗S Λ → Λ → 0,

where Kl := ( ˜Kl)0. Since ˜Kn+1 is generated in degree 1 (see Lemma 13),
we have Kn+1 = 0. This complex is exact since the maps and relations are
homogeneous. This is the Koszul resolution of Λ.

Now, if Λ is Koszul, then the new relations in Π described in Corollary 6

induce the existence of a superpotential ω given as follows:

ω := Xq∈Kn X0≤l≤n

(−1)lσl(qaq),

where σ = (1 2 · · · n − 1 n + 1) is the element of the symmetric group Sn+1
that acts as

σ(vn+1 ⊗ vn ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1) = v1 ⊗ vn+1 ⊗ vn ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2.

In fact, by deﬁnition of the arrows aq, we get that ω commutes with the
action of S. Moreover, since, by deﬁnition, every element q ∈ Kn is in

\µ

(V µ ⊗S M ⊗S V n−µ−2),

we obtain that ω is indeed super-cyclically symmetric. By Corollary 6, the
relations in Π are given by

δpω,

for any path p ∈ Π of length ((n + 1) − 2), so the preprojective algebra is
given by

Π ∼= k ˜Q/hδpωi = D(ω, (n + 1) − 2),

where ˜Q is the quiver of Π described in the previous corollary.

(cid:3)

Remark 2. This theorem generalizes a result in [Kel11], in which the au-
thor proves that a 3-preprojective algebra is a Jacobian algebra given by a
potential.

Question 9. If Λ is a Koszul n-representation-inﬁnite algebra, then Π(Λ) is
a quadratic algebra given by a superpotential. This raises the question about
when is it Koszul. For this we need to show that the associated complex W•,
described before Theorem 3, is a resolution of Π.

4. Tensor Product of Preprojective algebras

In this section, we study the preprojective grading structure of the tensor
product of two preprojective algebras. When considering the usual tensor
product grading on two graded k-algebras A and B, given by

(A ⊗k B)i = Ml+m=i

Al ⊗k Bm,

we get the following theorem.

Theorem 8. If Ai is a ni-Calabi-Yau algebra of Gorenstein parameter ai,
for i = 1, 2, then A1 ⊗k A2, along with the usual tensor product grading, is
(n1 + n2)-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter (a1 + a2).

Proof. The minimal bimodule resolution P• of A1 ⊗k A2 is given by tensoring
over k the minimal resolutions P 1
• of A1 and A2, respectively. Using
the fact that Ai is ni-Calabi-Yau of parameter ai, i = 1, 2, we see that

Now let Πi be a basic bimodule ni-Calabi-Yau algebra of Gorenstein pa-
rameter 1, for i = 1, 2. As shown, the tensor product of two Calabi-Yau
algebras is always Calabi-Yau. The main interest of this section is to deter-
mine whether or not we can put a grading on the tensor product Π1 ⊗k Π2
so that it is an algebra of Gorenstein parameter 1. By the previous theorem,
this grading cannot be the standard tensor product grading. There is always
a way to do so:

Theorem 9. Let Π1 and Π2 be as above. The tensor product Π1 ⊗k Π2
admits a grading giving it Gorenstein parameter 1.

Proof. We put Π1 in degree 0 and keep the grading on Π2. Then the Goren-
stein parameter of Π1 ⊗k Π2 is the same as the Gorenstein parameter of Π2,
which is 1.
(cid:3)

The degree 0 part of the grading that we put on Π1 ⊗k Π2 in Theorem 9
is of the form A1 ⊗k A2, where A1 = Π1 is n1-Calabi-Yau and A2 is (n2 − 1)-
representation-inﬁnite. Note that Calabi-Yau algebras are always inﬁnite-
dimensional. Since our main object of study are preprojective algebras,
we want to put a grading in such a way that the degree 0 part is ﬁnite-
dimensional, as this is a property of higher representation-inﬁnite algebras.
We show that this is impossible. More precisely, we show that the only
grading giving Π1 ⊗k Π2 Gorenstein parameter 1 is the one described in
Theorem 9, with the grading induced either from the ﬁrst or the second
factor.

Question 10. The algebra A1 ⊗k A2, while being inﬁnite-dimensional, has
ﬁnite global dimension and is the degree 0 part of a bimodule Calabi-Yau
algebra of Gorenstein parameter 1. This raises the question whether we can
extend the study of n-representation-inﬁnite algebras to algebras of inﬁnite
dimension, and generalize the notion of preprojective algebras to bimodule
Calabi-Yau algebras of Gorenstein parameter 1 such that the degree 0 part
is not necessarily ﬁnite-dimensional.

Example 11. Let A be a basic Koszul n-Calabi-Yau algebra. Then, the
Calabi-Yau homological property of A implies that the paths q ∈ Kn are
oriented cycles q : i → i. By Corollary 6, Π(A) has extra arrows aq : i → i.
Thus, taking the preprojective algebra simply adds loops in degree 1 at
every vertex, which increases the global dimension by one and the Gorenstein
parameter becomes 1.

In [HIO14], the authors study the tensor product of two representation-

inﬁnite algebras. They show

Theorem 10 ([HIO14]). Let Λi be a ni-representation-inﬁnite algebra, for
i = 1, 2. Then

• Λ1 ⊗k Λ2 is (n1 + n2)-representation-inﬁnite;
• S(Λ1 ⊗k Λ2) = S(Λ1) ⊗k S(Λ2);
• Sn1+n2(Λ2 ⊗k Λ2) = Sn1(Λ1) ⊗k Sn2(Λ2).

Combining these results together, we get the following.

Corollary 11. Let Λi be as above and let Πi = Π(Λi), for i = 1, 2, be the
preprojective algebra associated to Λi. Then the Segre product

Π1 ∗ Π2 :=Ml≥0

((Π1)l ⊗k (Π2)l)

is a (n1 + n2 + 1)-preprojective algebra.

Proof. We have that

Π1 ∗ Π2 =Ml≥0

n1(Λ1) ⊗k S−l

n2(Λ2)(cid:17)

((Π1)l ⊗k (Π2)l) =Ml≥0(cid:16)S−l
=Ml≥0

S−l
n1+n2 (Λ1 ⊗k Λ2) .

Since Λ1 ⊗k Λ2 is (n1 + n2)-representation-inﬁnite, the result follows.

(cid:3)

This tells us that the Segre product is the right object to consider when
taking tensor products.
Indeed, it only increases the global dimension of
Λ1 ⊗k Λ2 by one, whereas the tensor product increases it by two. Moreover,
the degree 1 part of the Segre product lives in degree 2 in the tensor prod-
uct. This is why the Segre product is of Gorenstein parameter 1, whereas
the tensor product is of Gorenstein parameter 2. Thus, the tensor product
seems somehow too big to be a preprojective algebra. If we force Gorenstein
parameter 1 on it, then we force inﬁnite-dimensionality of its degree 0 part.

4.1. Superpotential of a tensor product. Suppose that Ai = TSiVi/hMii
is a ni-Calabi-Yau and Koszul algebra, where Si
is a ﬁnite-dimensional
semisimple k-algebra, Vi is a Si-bimodule and Mi are relations, for i = 1, 2.
Then, A := A1 ⊗k A2 is (n1 + n2)-Calabi-Yau and Koszul. It thus admits a
superpotential. We would like to describe this superpotential in terms of w1
and w2, the superpotentials of A1 and A2, respectively. This is needed for
the main theorem of this section.

The superpotential ω in A is a S-bimodule generator of

Kn :=\µ

(V ⊗µ ⊗S M ⊗S V ⊗n−µ−2) ∼= TorA

n (S, S),

where S := S1 ⊗k S2, n = n1 + n2, V = V1 ⊕ V2, and M is the S-bimodule
of relations in A. We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of the shuﬄe product.

Deﬁnition 12 (See, e.g., [Wei94]). The shuﬄe product

 : TorA

n1(S1, S1) × TorA

n2(S2, S2) → TorA

n1(S1, S1) ⊗k TorA

n2(S2, S2)

is deﬁned as

v1
1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1

n1  v2

n1+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2

n1+n2 :=

Xσ

(−1)σv1

σ−1(1) ⊗ v1

σ−1(2) ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1

σ−1(n1) ⊗ v2

σ−1(n1+1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ v2

σ−1(n1+n2),

where the sum runs over all (n1, n2)-shuﬄes σ, that is, elements σ of the
symmetric group Sn1+n2 which satisfy σ(1) < σ(2) < · · · < σ(n1) and
σ(n1 + 1) < σ(n1 + 2) < · · · < σ(n1 + n2).

Theorem 12. Let ωi be a superpotential associated to Ai, i = 1, 2. A S-
bimodule generator of TorA

n (S, S) is given by

This is a superpotential in the algebra A.

ω := ω1  ω2.

Proof. It is known that the shuﬄe product induces a chain homotopy equiva-
lence of bar resolutions β of the (A1 ⊗k A2)-modules S1 ⊗k S2, see for example
([Wei94], 8.6.13):

Tot(β(A1, S1) ⊗k β(A2, S2)) → β(A1 ⊗k A2, S1 ⊗k S2).

We then obtain a S-bimodule isomorphism

TorA

n1(S1, S1) ⊗k TorA

n2(S2, S2) → TorA

n1+n2(S1 ⊗k S2, S1 ⊗k S2).

Since the algebras are Koszul, we have that the superpotential ωi of Ai
is a Si-bimodule generator of TorAi
ni (Si, Si), for i = 1, 2. Moreover, the
superpotential ω of A1 ⊗k A2 is a S-bimodule generator of

TorA

n1+n2(S1 ⊗k S2, S1 ⊗k S2).

Thus, it is given by the image of ω1 ⊗k ω2 via the shuﬄe map.

4.2. Preprojective structure on the tensor product of Preprojective
algebras. The goal of this subsection is to prove that the tensor product
of two basic Koszul preprojective algebras cannot have a grading giving it
a structure of preprojective algebras. We begin by proving some general
statements.

We recall the description of the quiver of a basic tensor product algebra
A := A1 ⊗k A2. Following [GMV98] for a complete analysis, let Γ1 and Γ2 be
the quivers of A1 and A2, respectively. Then the quiver Γ of A is described
as follows:

Γ0 = Γ1

0 × Γ2

j ∈ M2.
When A is Koszul, then the Koszul grading on A is the standard one given
by the tensor product.

i ∈ M1 and ˜M2 is the set consisting of the (e′, f 2

Now let Π be a n-Calabi-Yau algebra of Gorenstein parameter 1. Let P•
denote the minimal bimodule resolution of Π. In the case where we require
Π to be Koszul, we have that the terms in P• are given by

Pl = Π ⊗S ⊗Kl ⊗S Π,

where Kl ⊂ V ⊗S l is the usual term in the Koszul resolution deﬁned in the
preliminaries and the diﬀerentials are given by
δ(a ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl ⊗ a′) = av1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl ⊗ a′ + (−1)la ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vl−1 ⊗ vla′.

In the following lemmas we are interested in the preprojective structure

of Π.

Lemma 13 ([AIR15]). If Π is n-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1, then
each term Pi in the minimal bimodule resolution of Π is generated in degree
0 or in degree 1. Moreover, P0 is generated in degree 0 and Pn is generated
in degree 1.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

15

Proof. Since the resolution of Π is minimal and Π is positively graded, each
Pi is generated in non-negative degrees. Consider the isomorphism

P• ∼= P ∨

• [n](−1).

If Pi has a generator in degree a, then Pn−i has a generator in degree 1 − a.
Therefore, 1 − a ≥ 0, which implies that a = 0 or a = 1. Thus, each Pi is
generated in degree 0 or 1. But Π is generated in degree 0 as a bimodule
over itself, so P0 is generated in degree 0, and thus Pn is generated in degree
1.
(cid:3)

Lemma 14. Let Π be a Koszul n-Calabi-Yau algebra of Gorenstein param-
eter 1. Then

degPl(1 ⊗ vl ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ 1) =Xi

degΠ(vi) = degΠ(vl ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1),

where deg denote the degree of an element with respect to the preprojective
grading.

Proof. We proceed by induction on l and use the fact that the diﬀerentials
in the resolution are homogeneous with respect to the preprojective grading.
For l = 1, we have

δ(1 ⊗ v1 ⊗ 1) = v1 ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ v1 ∈ Π ⊗S Π,

so degP1(1 ⊗ v1 ⊗ 1) = degΠ(v1). In general, we have
δ(1⊗(v1 ⊗· · ·⊗vl)⊗1) = v1 ⊗(v2 ⊗· · ·⊗vl)⊗1+(−1)l1⊗(v1 ⊗· · ·⊗vl−1)⊗vl,

and the statement follows easily by induction.

(cid:3)

Now, let Πi = TSiVi/hMii be a basic bimodule ni-Calabi-Yau Koszul
algebra of Gorenstein parameter 1 over a semisimple algebra Si, for i = 1, 2.
Let

Π := Π1 ⊗k Π2 ∼= TSV /hM i,

be a n-Calabi-Yau Koszul algebra, where n = n1 + n2, S := S1 ⊗k S2,
V = V1 ⊕ V2 and M are induced relations. Let ωi be the superpotential
of Πi, i = 1, 2, and ω := ω1  ω2 be the superpotential of Π, according to
Theorem 12.

Theorem 15. Let Π1 and Π2 be as above and let Π := Π1 ⊗k Π2. If Π
is bimodule n-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1, then the degree 0 part
is of the form A1 ⊗k A2, where A1 is n1-Calabi-Yau and A2 is (n2 − 1)-
representation-inﬁnite, or vice versa.
In particular, Π does not admit a
structure of preprojective algebra.

Proof. Let Γi be the quiver of Πi, for i = 1, 2 and Γ be the quiver of Π. We
assume that Π is (n1 + n2)-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1.

By lemma 13, the S-bimodule generator ω ∈ Kn1+n2 in P•, which is the
superpotential of Π, is homogeneous of degree 1. Moreover, by lemma 14
the degree of the elements in Kl is the same as the degree of the associated
paths in Π.

16

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

The superpotential ω of Π is of the form ω = ω1  ω2.

In particular,
all summands of ω1 ⊗k ω2 are summands of ω. These summands have the
property that they are closed paths (e, e′) → (e, e′) of length (n1 + n2) that
are the concatenation of two closed paths (e, e′) → (e, e′) of length n1 and
n2 respectively, for some vertex (e, e′) in Γ.

Consider one of these summands (e, q)(p, e′), where p is a closed path and
a summand of ω1, and q is a closed path and a summand of ω2. Since ω is
homogeneous of degree 1, the path (e, q)(p, e′) is in degree 1. By additivity
of the degree, either (e, q) or (p, e′) is in degree 1, say (p, e′) without loss of
generality. Then (e, q) is in degree 0. Denote by (a, e′) the arrow in (p, e′)
which is in degree 1.

Let σ = (1 2 · · · n1) ∈ Sn1 be acting as usual on elements in V ⊗n1

1

, that

is,

σr(vn1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1) = vr ⊗ vr−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ vn1 ⊗ vn1−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr+1.

The path

σr(p, e′) := (σr(p), e′)

is in degree 1 for all 0 ≤ r < n1, since it contains (a, e′). Thus, at any
vertex (ei, e′) for which ei is the start vertex of σr(p) for some r, the path
(ei, q)(σr(p), e′) is in degree 1, therefore (ei, q) is in degree 0. Now, by the
same reasoning, for every vertex ej in q, the path (p, ej ) is in degree 1.

Now consider a vertex l ∈ Γ2 which is not in the path q. We claim that
the path (p, l) is also in degree 1. We use the symbol ♯ to denote two vertices
connected by an arrow. Consider the following non-oriented path

(e, f1)♯(e, f2)♯ · · · ♯(e, l),

where f1 ∈ Γ2 is a vertex in the path q. Such a path exists since the quiver is
connected. Recall that the path (p, f1) : (e, f1) → (e, f1) is in degree 1. The
arrow between (e, f1) and (e, f2) is part of a closed cycle, call it (e, q′). This
cycle must be in degree 0, as (p, f1) is in degree 1. Thus, the cycle (p, f2)
must be in degree 1. Continuing in this fashion, we see that the path (p, l)
is in degree 1.

Thus, any path of the form (p, ǫ′), where ǫ′ ∈ Γ2, is in degree 1. By the

same reasoning, any path of the form (ǫ, q), where ǫ ∈ Γ1 is in degree 0.

Now, consider another closed summand ρ of ω1 starting at a vertex µ.
The path (µ, q)(ρ, e′) is in degree 1. Because (µ, q) is in degree 0, we have
that (ρ, e′) must be in degree 1. By the previous argument, this implies that
any (ρ, ǫ′) is in degree 1 for any vertex ǫ′ ∈ Γ2. By a similar argument, we
get that any (ǫ, ρ′) is in degree 0 for any summand ρ′ of ω2 and vertex ǫ ∈ Γ1.

Therefore, for any ǫ ∈ Γ1, the superpotential (ǫ, ω2) is in degree 0 and, for

every ǫ′ ∈ Γ2, the superpotential (ω1, ǫ′) is in degree 1.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

17

It remains to show that if (a, e) is the arrow in (p, e) in degree 1, then
(a, ǫ′) is in degree 1 for any ǫ′ ∈ Γ2. Say a : i → j in Γ1. Consider as before
a non-oriented path

and the parallel non-oriented path

(i, e)♯(i, f1)♯ · · · ♯(i, ǫ′)

(j, e)♯(j, f1)♯ · · · ♯(j, ǫ′).

Then, consider an arrow b1 ∈ Π2 between e and f1, say, without loss of
generality, that b : e → f1. Then by the commutativity relations on the
tensor product, we have

(a, f1)(i, b) = (j, b)(a, e).

Because b ∈ Π2, the arrows (i, b) and (j, b) are in degree 0, using what we
just showed. Moreover, (a, e) is in degree 1 by assumption. So (a, f1) is in
degree 1 by homogeneity of the relations. Now, consider b2 ∈ Π2 between f1
and f2, say b2 : f1 → f2. By the same reasoning,

(a, f2)(i, b) = (j, b)(a, f1),

so (a, f2) is in degree 1. Continuing in this fashion, we get that (a, ǫ′) is in
degree 1. This proves that for any arrow α ∈ Π1, all arrows (α, ǫ′) have the
same degree, so their degree is induced from the grading on Π1. Therefore,
the degree 0 part of Π must be of the form A1 ⊗k A2, where A1 is (n1 − 1)-
representation inﬁnite and A2 is n2-Calabi-Yau.

5. Preprojective algebra structure on the skew-group

algebra

The motivation of this section is to generalize the following theorem, de-

scribed in [RVdB89] (see also [CBH98]), to ﬁnite subgroups of SL(n, k).

Theorem 16 ([RVdB89]). Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(2, k). Then the
skew-group algebra k[x, y]#G is Morita equivalent to Π(QG), the preprojec-
tive algebra over the extended Coxeter-Dynkin quiver associated to G via the
McKay correspondence.

Throughout this section, let R = k[x1, . . . , xn] = k[V ] be the polynomial
ring in n variables and let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(n, k) acting on V .
Recall the deﬁnition of the skew-group algebra R#G:

as kG-modules, and the multplication is given by

R#G = R ⊗k kG

(v1, g1) · (v2, g2) = (v1g1(v2), g1g2).

Note that, as described for example in [BSW10], the skew-group algebra

R#G ∼= TkG(V ⊗k kG)/hM ⊗k kGi,

where M is the vector space of commutativity relations in R = k[V ], and
the bimodule action of kG on V ⊗k kG is given by

g1(v ⊗k h)g2 = (g1v ⊗ g1hg2).

We want to know for which ﬁnite subgroup G of SL(n, k) is the algebra
R#G Morita equivalent to a higher preprojective algebra. We show that if

18

LOUIS-PHILIPPE THIBAULT

G embeds into a product of special linear groups, then R#G does not have
a structure of preprojective algebra.

Note that R#G is always n-Calabi-Yau, so the diﬃculty lies in ﬁnding a
grading that gives R#G Gorenstein parameter 1. Again, this grading must
have the property that the degree 0 part is ﬁnite-dimensional, as we want
it to be (n − 1)-representation-inﬁnite. This grading cannot be induced by
putting the variables x1, . . . , xn in R in some degree a1, . . . , an, respectively,
and G in degree 0, since in this case the Gorenstein parameter would be

P1≤i≤n ai.

The algebra structure of R#G is related to the McKay quiver of G.

Deﬁnition 13 ([McK83]). Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n, k). The
McKay quiver MG of G has a vertex set corresponding to each irreducible
representation ρ of G. Let V be the given representation of dimension n
and Sρ be the simple kG-module corresponding to ρ. The number of arrows
ρ1 → ρ2 in MG is equal to

dimk(HomkG(Sρ2, V ⊗k Sρ1)).

Theorem 17 (See, e.g., [GMV02]). Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n, k),
then R#G is Morita equivalent to kMG/hM i, where MG is the McKay quiver
of G and M is the kG-bimodule of relations induced from the commutativity
relations in R.

When G is abelian, the Morita equivalence is an isomorphism, since R#G
is then basic. There is then an explicit correspondence between the arrows
in MG and the variables in R.

In this case, we have a description of the McKay quiver of G. The group
is simultaneously diagonalizable so we can assume that all its elements are
diagonal matrices. Let ρi : G → k∗ be deﬁned as ρi(g) = αi, where αi is the
ith diagonal element of g, for i = 1, . . . , n. Then the McKay quiver of G is
described as follows.

Theorem 18 ([CMT07]). Let G be an abelian ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n, k).
The McKay quiver MG of G has an arrow xρ
i : ρ → ρρi for each irreducible
representation ρ and all i = 1, . . . , n. We say that xρ
i is an arrow of type xi.
If G is a cyclic group of order r, then it is generated by a diagonal matrix
with entries ξa1, . . . , ξan , where ξ is a primitive rth root of unity. We denote
this group by

G = h

(a1, . . . , an)i.

5.1. Tensor product of skew-group algebras. We apply last section’s
result to the current context. First assume that Gi is a ﬁnite subgroup of
SL(ni, k) and Ri is the polynomial ring in ni variables, for i = 1, 2. Then
we have the following KG-module isomorphisms:

R1#G1 ⊗k R2#G2 ∼= R1 ⊗k kG1 ⊗k R2 ⊗k kG2

∼= (R1 ⊗k R2) ⊗k (kG1 ⊗k kG2) ∼= R ⊗k k[G1 × G2],

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

where R is the polynomial ring in (n := n1 + n2) variables. The map is given
by

(f (v), g1) ⊗k (g(w), g2) 7→(cid:18)f (v) ⊗k g(w),(cid:18) g1

0

0

g2 (cid:19)(cid:19)

and it respects the tensor product multiplication, so this is an algebra iso-
morphism. Let G = G1 × G2, where each element of G is given by

(cid:18) g1

0

0

g2 (cid:19) ,

for g1 ∈ G1 and g2 ∈ G2. Then G < SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k). The algebra
R#G is Morita equivalent to

kMG1/hM1i ⊗k kMG2/hM2i,

where MGi is the McKay quiver of Gi and Mi are the induced relations, i =
1, 2. Since Morita equivalence preserves the bimodule Calabi-Yau property,
we obtain the following corollary to Theorem 15.

Corollary 19. If G < SL(n, k) is a ﬁnite group such that G is conjugate to
G1 × G2, where Gi < SL(ni, k), i = 1, 2, and n1 + n2 = n, then R#G does
not have a grading structure making it Morita equivalent to a preprojective
algebra.

This corollary motivates the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 14. Let G < SL(n, k) be ﬁnite. We say that G embeds into
SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), for some n1, n2 ≥ 1 such that n1 + n2 = n, if G is
conjugate to a group such that each of its element is of the form

(cid:18) g1

0

0

g2 (cid:19) ,

where g1 ∈ SL(n1, k) and g2 ∈ SL(n2, k). Equivalently, the given represen-
tation V of G can be written as

V ∼= V1 ⊕ V2,

where Λn1V1 and Λn2V2 are the trivial representations.

If G1, G2 and H are ﬁnite groups and φi : Gi → H is an epimorphism for

i = 1, 2, deﬁne the ﬁbre product G1 ×H G2 as

G1 ×H G2 :=(cid:26)(cid:18) g1

0

0

g2 (cid:19) | g1 ∈ G1, g2 ∈ G2, φ1(g1) = φ2(g2)(cid:27) .

By Goursat’s lemma, these are exactly the ﬁnite subgroups of G1 × G2.
Therefore, G embeds into SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k) if and only if it is conjugate
to a ﬁbre product of this form.

Remark 3. The group G from Corollary 19 embeds into SL(n1, k)×SL(n2, k).
In the next subsection, we generalize this result to any ﬁnite group having
this property.

5.2. A converse to a theorem of Amiot-Iyama-Reiten. In their paper,
C. Amiot, O. Iyama and I. Reiten proved the following:

Theorem 20 ([AIR15]). Let G be a ﬁnite cyclic subgroup of SL(n, k) of
order r. Suppose that there exists a generator g = 1
r (a1, . . . , an) of G such
that

(1) (ai, r) = 1 and 0 < ai < r for all i;
(2) a1 + · · · + an = r.

Then there exists a grading on R#G giving it a higher preprojective algebra
structure.

Remark 4. The ﬁrst condition ensures that RG is an isolated singularity.
For our purpose, it is not necessary to assume this condition. Indeed, we
will consider products of groups that will contain elements with eigenvalues
equal to 1. If 0 ≤ ai < r for all i, then the second condition is automatically
satisﬁed when n = 2 and n = 3.

Using the description of the McKay quiver of a cyclic group G, we can
label the vertices from 1 to r. There is an arrow of type xj from l → l + aj,
where the sum is taken modulo r, for every vertex l ∈ MG.

The grading mentioned in Theorem 20, that deﬁnes a preprojective algebra

structure on R#G, is given by the following:

deg(xl

0 else.

Condition 2 in Theorem 20 is speciﬁc to cyclic groups. Thus, if we want
to generalize this statement or to ﬁnd a converse for any group (which is the
purpose of this section), we need to reinterpret this condition.

With remark 3 in mind, we see that condition 2 follows from the fact that

G does not embed into SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k).

Lemma 21. Let G be a ﬁnite cyclic subgroup of SL(n, k) of order r. If the
group G embeds into SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k) for some n1, n2 ≥ 1 such that
n1 + n2 = n, then either one of the following is true.

(a) There exists a generator g = 1

r (a1, . . . , an) of G such that ai = 0 for

some i;

(b) Every generator g = 1

r (a1, . . . , an) of G is such that 0 < ai < r and

the sum a1 + · · · + an > r.

The converse is true if n ≤ 4 or G satisﬁes condition (a).

Proof. If G embeds into SL(n1, k)×SL(n2, k), then G clearly satisﬁes condi-
tion (a) or (b). Now, if (a) is true, then G embeds into SL(n−1, k)×SL(1, k).
Finally, if G < SL(n, k), where n ≤ 4, satisﬁes condition (b), then the claim
follows from [MS84].
(cid:3)

Let Ri be the polynomial ring in ni variables, for i = 1, 2. If G embeds
into SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), then the algebra of invariants RG is an isolated
singularity if and only if G is conjugate to

G ×G G < SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k),

where G ×G G is the diagonal embedding in G × G, and RG
2 are
isolated singularities. The McKay quiver of G ×G G is easy to describe. The
vertices are given by the irreducible representations of G. Moreover, there is
an arrow ρ1 → ρ2 if and only if there is an arrow ρ1 → ρ2 in M i
G, for some
G is the McKay quiver of the ith component in G ×G G.

In light of Lemma 21, we prove a partial converse to the theorem of
Amiot, Iyama and Reiten, which generalizes to any subgroup of SL(n, k).
Let B := R#G. Throughout this section, we suppose that G embeds in
SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), where n1 + n2 = n. Equivalently, G is conjugate to
a ﬁbre product G1 ×H G2, where Gi is a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(ni, k) and H
is some ﬁnite group such that Gi surjects onto it, for i = 1, 2.

Let’s ﬁrst describe the minimal B-bimodule resolution of B using the

Koszul complex of R.

Theorem 22 ([BSW10], [AIR15], [HIO14]). Let V be the given representa-
tion of G. The following complex is a minimal projective B-bimodule reso-
lution of B:

P• = B ⊗kG(cid:16)^n

V ⊗k kG(cid:17) ⊗kG B → B ⊗kG(cid:16)^n−1

V ⊗k kG(cid:17) ⊗kG B

Moreover, P• ∼= P ∨

• [n], where (−)∨ = HomBe(−, Be).

→ · · · → B ⊗kG B.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

Proof. The following complex is the Koszul bimodule resolution of R = k[V ]:

0 → R ⊗k^n

V ⊗k R → · · · → R ⊗k R → R → 0.

Now, tensoring over k with kG is an exact functor that gives us the required
resolution. In fact, we have

R ⊗k^l

V ⊗k R ⊗k kG ∼= R ⊗k kG ⊗kG^l

V ⊗k kG ⊗kG R ⊗k kG

The B-bimodule generators of

Pl := B ⊗kG(cid:18)^l

V ⊗k kG(cid:19) ⊗kG B

are given by the elements (1, 1) ⊗ (xjl ∧ xjl−1 ∧ · · · ∧ x1 ⊗ 1) ⊗ (1, 1). This
implies that a superpotential in R#G is given by the S-bimodule generator

ω ⊗ 1 ⊂ ΛnV ⊗k kG = Kn,

where ω := xn ∧xn−1∧· · ·∧x1 is the superpotential giving the commutativity
relations in R.

Theorem 23. Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(n, k). If B := R#G has
a grading structure of n-preprojective algebra, then G does not embed in
SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k) for any n1, n2 ≥ 1 such that n1 + n2 = n.

Proof. Suppose that G = G1 ×H G2, where G1 < SL(n1, k) and G2 <
SL(n2, k). Then the given representation decomposes as V ∼= V1 ⊕ V2, where
Vi is a ni-dimensional vector space, i = 1, 2. Assume by contradiction that
G has a grading structure of preprojective algebra such that the degree 0
part is ﬁnite-dimensional.

By Lemma 13, the superpotential ω ⊗ 1 is a kG-bimodule generator of
ΛnV ⊗k kG in degree 1.
It corresponds to elements of the same degree
in B, by Lemma 14. Thus, for any idempotent el corresponding to the
irreducible representations, the summand (xn ⊗ xn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ x1) ⊗ el is in
degree 1. Now, using the fact that G embeds in SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), we
get a decomposition

(xn ⊗xn−1 ⊗· · ·⊗x1)⊗el = (xn ⊗xn−1 ⊗· · ·⊗xn2+1)⊗el ·(xn2 ⊗· · ·⊗x1)⊗el,

and each component commutes with the action of kG. By additivity of the
degrees, one of these two components must be in degree 0, and the other
must be in degree 1. Suppose without loss of generality that

(xn ⊗ xn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn2+1) ⊗ el

is in degree 0. Then,

{1 ⊗ el, (xn ⊗ xn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn2+1) ⊗ el, (xn ⊗ xn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn2+1)2 ⊗ el,

(xn ⊗ xn−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn2+1)3 ⊗ el, . . .}

is an inﬁnite set of linearly independent elements of degree 0 in B. Therefore,
B does not have a structure of preprojective algebra.
(cid:3)

Remark 6. In the case where G is cyclic, we obtain a partial converse to
Theorem 20, which is a full converse if n = 4.

Example 17. Let G = h 1
3 (1, 2, 1, 2)i < SL(2, k) × SL(2, k) be the group
described in Example 16. The skew-group algebra R#G does not have a
structure of preprojective algebra. As we showed, paths of length 4 in the
superpotential go twice through the same vertex. However, since they must
be in degree 1, there exists an oriented cycle in degree 0, which means that
the degree 0 part is inﬁnite-dimensional.

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

25

Now, we want to consider the basic algebra Morita equivalent to B. Let

e = P el be the sum of all idempotents in kG associated to the irreducible

representations of G. If

R#G = TkG(V ⊗k kG)/hM ⊗k kGi,

then R#G is Morita equivalent to

eR#Ge ∼= TekGe(eV ⊗k kGe)/heM ⊗k kGei,

see for example [BSW10] for a proof. In the case where G is abelian, this
Morita equivalence is an isomorphism. The superpotential is given by

e(ω ⊗k 1)e.

Theorem 24. At each vertex ej in MG, there exists a closed summand p in
eω ⊗k 1e of length n that goes twice through the vertex ej.

Proof. Let Sj be the simple kG-module associated to ej. Note that, because
G embeds in SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k), the module

ΛniV ⊗k Sj

contains Sj as a direct summand for i = 1, 2. Now, each path p : t(p) → h(p)
of length l corresponds to a map

St(p) → V ⊗S l ⊗k Sh(p) → ΛlV ⊗k Sh(p).

Since there is an obvious map Sj → Sj ⊂ ΛniV ⊗k Sj, we get a closed path
pi of length ni at Sj for i = 1, 2. Concatenating these two paths, we get the
required path p = p1 ⊗ p2 of length n that goes twice through the vertex ej.
This corresponds to a summand of the superpotential, since it corresponds
to an element in ΛnV ⊗k kG.
(cid:3)

Suppose that eR#Ge has a structure of preprojective algebra. These
closed paths are summands of the superpotential in eR#Ge, and thus, by
the same reasoning as in the previous subsection, they must be in degree
1. By additivity of the grading on concatenation, we have a closed oriented
path in degree 0, the other being in degree 1. However, we cannot directly
apply the same idea as in the previous theorem, for some of the powers of
the path in degree 0 could be equal to 0 in the algebra eR#Ge.

Remark 7. In ([HIO14], Question 5.9), the authors conjecture that the quiver
of a (n − 1)-hereditary algebra must be acyclic. Thus, if we assume this
conjecture to be true, the previous discussion already demonstrates that if
G embeds in a product of special linear groups, then B := R#G is not
Morita equivalent to a preprojective algebra.

Lemma 25. If Λ is a (n − 1)-representation-inﬁnite algebra, and e is a full
idempotent in Λ, that is, ΛeΛ = Λ, then

eExtn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe)e ∼= Extn−1

Moreover, if Md(−) denotes the algebra of d × d matrices, then

p∈Kn

Λej ⊗k eiΛ

f

p∈Kn−1

Λej ⊗k eiΛ → · · · → Λ ⊗S Λ → Λ → 0.

Then, as we proved in Theorem 5,

Extn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe) ∼= Mp:i→j

p∈Kn

Λei ⊗k ejΛ/Im ˜f ,

where ˜f = HomΛe(f, Λe). Therefore

Now idempotents in Md(Extn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe)) induce idempotents in

Extn−1

Md(Λe)(Md(Λ), Md(Λe))

∼= Md(f11Extn−1

Md(Λe)(Md(Λ), Md(Λe))f11),

where f11 is the idempotent corresponding to the entry (1, 1) in the matrix
algebra. Applying the ﬁrst part of this proof again, the algebra is isomorphic
to

Md(Extn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe)).

(cid:3)

We now show that eR#Ge does not have a structure of preprojective

algebra.

Theorem 26. Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of SL(n, k) such that G embeds in

SL(n1, k) × SL(n2, k). Let e =P el be the sum of all idempotents associated

to the irreducible representations of G in B := R#G. Then eBe does not
have a grading structure of preprojective algebra.

Proof. Suppose that

eBe ∼= TΛExtn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe),

where Λ is a (n − 1)-representation-inﬁnite algebra. Then

B ∼= f Md(TΛExtn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe))f,

for some d, where Md(−) denotes the algebra of d × d matrices and f is a full
idempotent in Md(TΛExtn−1
Λe (Λ, Λe)). Let F be the equivalence of categories

F : Bimod eBe → Bimod f Md(eBe)f.

Since Md(−) commute with direct sums and tensor products and f is also a
full idempotent in

we obtain

Md(Λ) ⊂ Md(TΛExtn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe)),

F(M ⊗Λ N ) ∼= F(M ) ⊗f Md(Λ)f F(N ),

PREPROJECTIVE ALGEBRA STRUCTURE ON SKEW-GROUP ALGEBRAS

27

and the same is true for direct sums. Thus,

B ∼= Tf Md(Λ)f f Md(Extn−1

Λe (Λ, Λe))f.

By Lemma 25, we obtain that

B ∼= Tf Md(Λ)f Extn−1

f Md(Λe)f (f Md(Λ)f, f Md(Λe)f ),

so B is itself n-Calabi-Yau of Gorenstein parameter 1. Therefore, by Theo-
rem 23, we get that f Md(Λ)f is inﬁnite-dimensional. This implies that Λ is
inﬁnite-dimensional, which is a contradiction.
