Abstract

Let a, b, e be algebras over a ﬁeld k. Then e is an extension of a by b if a is
an ideal of e and b is isomorphic to the quotient algebra e/a. In this paper,
by using Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for associative (resp. Lie) alge-
bras, we give complete characterizations of associative (resp. Lie) algebra
extensions of a by b, where b is presented by generators and relations.

1 Introduction

Let A and B be groups. By a group extension of A by B we shall mean a short
exact sequence of groups and homomorphisms

1 → A → G → B → 1,

i.e., A is a normal subgroup of G such that B ∼= G/A. If this is the case, we
also call G an extension of A by B.

The classical theory of group extension was developed by O. Schreier [39, 40]
while the homological implications of the theory were recognized by S. Eilenberg
and S. MacLane [25]. Some results on characterizations of group extensions are
included in M. Hall [29], S. Maclane [35], G.P. Hochschild and J.-P.Serre [33],
and so on. It states in Hall’s book ([29], p. 228) that “it is diﬃcult to determine
the identities (in A) leading to conditions for an extension, where the group B

is presented by generators and relations.” The Hall’s problem above has been
solved by Yuqun Chen in a recent paper [20] by using Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases
method.

Let a, b, e be algebras over a ﬁeld k and

0 → a → e → b → 0

a short exact sequence. Then e is called an extension of a by b.

Inspired by Hall’s problem above, one needs to ﬁnd all extensions of a by b,

where b is presented by generators and relations.

There are many results on extensions of algebras, in particular on extensions
of associative algebras, Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras, etc, see, for example,
[2, 3, 22, 27, 28, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 43]. Mostly, they deal with some special
cases for extensions. There is no result to determine conditions for an extension
when the algebra b is presented by generators and relations.

We discover Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases method is helpful to characterise the
extensions of a by b when one deals with b being presented by generators and
relations.

Gr¨obner bases and Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases were invented independently by
A.I. Shirshov for ideals of free (commutative, anti-commutative) non-associative
algebras [42, 44], free Lie algebras [41, 44] and implicitly free associative alge-
bras [41, 44] (see also [4, 6]), by H. Hironaka [31] for ideals of the power series
algebras (both formal and convergent), and by B. Buchberger [17] for ideals of
the polynomial algebras. Gr¨obner bases and Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theories
have been proved to be very useful in diﬀerent branches of mathematics, in-
cluding commutative algebra and combinatorial algebra. It is a powerful tool to
solve the following classical problems: normal form; word problem; conjugacy
problem; rewriting system; automaton; embedding theorem; PBW theorem; ex-
tension; homology; growth function; Dehn function; complexity; etc. See, for
example, the books [1, 15, 18, 19, 23, 26], the papers [4, 5, 6, 10, 24, 30, 37],
and the surveys [8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14].

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review Gr¨obner-Shirshov
bases theory for associative algebras. We give a complete characterization of
associative algebra extensions of a by b, where b is presented by generators and
relations. Some applications of such a characterization are given.
In section
3, we review Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for Lie algebras. We give a com-
plete characterization of Lie algebra extensions. Some applications of such a
characterization are given.

2 Extensions of associative algebras

2.1 Composition-Diamond lemma for associative algebras

In this subsection, we review Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for associative al-
gebras.

Let X be a set and X ∗ (resp. S(X)) be the free monoid (resp. semigroup)
on X. For any u ∈ X ∗, we denote |u| the length (degree) of u. Let khX+i =
kS(X) (resp. khXi = kX ∗) be the free associative algebra on X without identity
(resp. with identity) over a ﬁeld k.

A well order > on X ∗ is called monomial if for any u, v, w ∈ X ∗,

u > v ⇒ uw > vw, wu > wv.

A classical example of monomial order on X ∗ is the deg-lex order, which ﬁrst
compare two words by degree (length) and then by comparing them lexicograph-
ically, where X is a well-ordered set.

Now, we assume that X ∗ is equipped with a monomial order >. For every
nonzero polynomial f ∈ khX+i, denote ¯f the leading word of f with respect to
the order >. If the coeﬃcient of ¯f in f is equal to 1, then f is called monic. If
S ⊆ khX+i with each s ∈ S monic, then S is also called monic.

Let f and g be two monic polynomials in khX+i. There are two kinds of

compositions:

(i) If w = ¯f a = b¯g for some a, b ∈ X ∗ with | ¯f |+|¯g| > |w|, then the polynomial
(f, g)w = f a − bg is called the intersection composition of f and g with respect
to the ambiguity w.

(ii) If w = ¯f = a¯gb for some a, b ∈ X ∗, then the polynomial (f, g)w = f −agb
is called the inclusion composition of f and g with respect to the ambiguity w.
Let S ⊆ khX+i be monic. The composition (f, g)w is called trivial modulo

(S, w) if (f, g)w = P αiaisibi, where each αi ∈ k, ai, bi ∈ X ∗, si ∈ S and

aisibi < w. If this is the case, then we write (f, g)w ≡ 0 mod(S, w).

A monic set S is called a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khX+i if any composition

(f, g)w of polynomials f, g ∈ S is trivial modulo (S, w).

A Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis S in khX+i is minimal if there is no inclusion
composition in S. Let c = khX+|Ri be an associative algebra generated by X
and deﬁning relations R. Then for any monomial order on X ∗, one can ﬁnd a
minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis S in khX+i such that c = khX+|Ri = khX+|Si,
see, [12].

The following theorem was proved by A.I. Shirshov [41] for Lie algebras
(with deg-lex order) in 1962 (see also L.A. Bokut [5]).
In 1976, L.A. Bokut
[6] specialized the approach of A.I. Shirshov to associative algebras (see also
G.M. Bergman [4]). For commutative polynomials, this lemma is known as the
Buchberger’s Theorem (see [16, 17]).

Theorem 2.1 (Composition-Diamond lemma for associative algebras) Let S ⊆
khX+i be monic, Id(S) the ideal of khX+i generated by S and > a monomial
order on X ∗. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(a) S is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khX+i.
(b) f ∈ Id(S) ⇒ ¯f = a¯sb for some s ∈ S and a, b ∈ X ∗.

(c) Irr(S) = {u ∈ S(X)|u 6= a¯sb, s ∈ S, a, b ∈ X ∗} is a linear basis of the

associative algebra khX+|Si = khX+i/Id(S).

2.2 A characterization of extensions of associative alge-

bras

Let a, b be associative algebras over a ﬁeld k.
In this subsection, by using
Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for associative algebras, we give a complete char-
acterization of extensions of a by b, where b is presented by generators and
relations.

Deﬁnition 2.2 Let c and d be two associative algebras. Then c is called a
compatible d-bimodule if c is a d-bimodule and for any c, c′ ∈ c and d ∈ d,

(c · d)c′ = c(d · c′),

(d · c)c′ = d · (cc′),

(cc′) · d = c(c′ · d),

where · is the d-bimodule operation.

Let a be an associative algebra with a linear basis A and the multiplication
table: aa′ = {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ A, where {aa′} is a linear combination of elements in
A. This means that a = khA+|aa′ − {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ Ai. Let b = khB+|Ri be an
associative algebra generated by a set B with deﬁning relations R.

Assume that >B∗ is a monomial order on B∗, >A a well order on A and >A∗
the deg-lex order on A∗. Let >(A∪B)∗ be the lex order on (A ∪ B)∗ with respect
to the order >A∪B on A ∪ B such that b >A∪B a for any a ∈ A, b ∈ B.

Now we deﬁne a monomial order (A ∪ B)∗.
For any w ∈ (A ∪ B)∗, w can be uniquely expressed as

w = u0v1u1v2u2 · · · vnun, n ≥ 0,

where vi ∈ S(B), i = 1, 2, · · · , n, u0, un ∈ A∗ and uj ∈ S(A), j = 1, 2, · · · , n − 1.
Denote wB = v1v2 · · · vn for n > 0 and wB = 1 for n = 0, wA = u0u1u2 · · · un,
and wt(w) = (wB , wA, w).

For any w, w′ ∈ (A ∪ B)∗, deﬁne

w > w′ if wt(w) > wt(w′)

lexicographically

(1)

It is clear that such an order is a monomial order on (A ∪ B)∗, which is an
extension of the order >B∗ on B∗.

For convenience, we may assume that R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis

in khB+i with respect to >B∗.

Let ⌊ ⌋ : R → a be a map, which is called a factor set of b in a. Suppose

that a is a compatible khB+i-bimodule with the module operation ·. Deﬁne

E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = kh(A ∪ B)+|R(⌊ ⌋,·)i,

where R(⌊ ⌋,·) is the set consisting of the following polynomials in kh(A ∪ B)+i:

faa′ : = aa′ − {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ A,
rab : = ab − a · b,
lba : = ba − b · a,
hf : = f − ⌊f ⌋,

a ∈ A, b ∈ B,
f ∈ R.

a ∈ A, b ∈ B,

4

Lemma 2.3 With the order deﬁned by (1), R(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis
in kh(A ∪ B)+i if and only if the following two conditions hold:

(a) For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, f · a = {⌊f ⌋a}, a · f = {a⌊f ⌋} in a.

(b) For any intersection composition (f1, f2)w, f1, f2 ∈ R, w = f1c = df2, c, d ∈

B∗ with |f1| + |f2| > |w|, if (f1, f2)w = f1c − df2 =P αicigidi, where each

αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R, cigidi < w, then in a,

⌊f1⌋ · c − d · ⌊f2⌋ =X αici · ⌊gi⌋ · di.

Moreover, if this is the case, E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) is an extension of a by b.

Proof. Since R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khB+i, there is no inclu-
sion composition in R(⌊ ⌋,·). Then, the only possible intersection compositions
in R(⌊ ⌋,·) are related to the following ambiguities:

aa′a′′, f a = vba, af = abv, f1c = df2, aba′, bab′, baa′, aa′b,

where a, a′, a′′ ∈ A, b, b′ ∈ B, f, f1, f2 ∈ R, v, c, d ∈ B∗, |f1| + |f2| > |f1c|.

If w = aa′a′′, then (faa′, fa′a′′ )w ≡ 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w).
If w = f a = vba, then

(hf , lba)w = (f − ⌊f ⌋)a − v(ba − b · a) ≡ (f − f )a − ⌊f ⌋a + v(b · a)

≡ (f − f ) · a − ⌊f ⌋a + (vb) · a ≡ f · a − {⌊f ⌋a} mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w).

Thus, (hf , lba)w ≡ 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w) if and only if f · a = {⌊f ⌋a}.

Similarly, (rab, hf )w ≡ 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w) if and only if a · f = {a⌊f ⌋}, where

w = abv = af .

If w = f1c = df2 with |f1| + |f2| > |w|, where f1, f2 ∈ R, then

(hf1 , hf2 )w = (f1 − ⌊f1⌋)c − d(f2 − ⌊f2⌋) = (f1c − df2) − ⌊f1⌋c + d⌊f2⌋.

Since R is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khB+i, we have

(f1, f2)w = f1c − df2 =X αicigidi,

where each αi ∈ k, gi ∈ R, ci, di ∈ B∗ and cigidi < w. Then,

(hf1 , hf2 )w = X αici(gi − ⌊gi⌋)di +X αici⌊gi⌋di − ⌊f1⌋c + d⌊f2⌋
≡ X αici⌊gi⌋di − ⌊f1⌋c + d⌊f2⌋
≡ X αici · ⌊gi⌋ · di − ⌊f1⌋ · c + d · ⌊f2⌋ mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w).
⌊f1⌋ · c − d · ⌊f2⌋ =X αici · ⌊gi⌋ · di.

Thus, (hf1 , hf2 )w ≡ 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w) if and only if

Since a is a compatible khB+i-bimodule, it is easy to check that

(rab, lba′ )w = 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w), w = aba′,
(lba, rab′ )w = 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w), w = bab′,
(lba, faa′ )w = 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w), w = baa′,
(faa′, ra′b)w = 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w), w = aa′b.

For example, if w = aba′, then

(rab, lba′ )w = (ab − a · b)a′ − a(ba′ − b · a′) ≡ −(a · b)a′ + a(b · a′)

≡ {(a · b)a′} − {a(b · a′)} ≡ 0 mod(R(⌊ ⌋,·), w).

Therefore, we can see that R(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in kh(A∪B)+i

if and only if the conditions (a) and (b) hold.

If R(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis, then by Composition-Diamond lemma
for associative algebras, we have that Irr(R(⌊ ⌋,·)) = A ∪ Irr(R) is a linear basis
of E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·), where Irr(R) = {w ∈ S(B)|w 6= a ¯f b, f ∈ R, a, b ∈ B∗}. Thus,
E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = a ⊕ b as linear space with the multiplication: for any a, a′ ∈ A and
u, u′ ∈ Irr(R),

(a + u)(a′ + u′) = {aa′} + a · u′ + u · a′ +X δiui +X βjcj · ⌊gj⌋ · dj,

where uu′ =P δiui +P βjcjgjdj in khB+i and δi, βj ∈ k, ui ∈ Irr(R), gj ∈

It is easy to see that a is an ideal of E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·). Deﬁne

R, cj, dj ∈ B∗.

πxy,· : E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = a ⊕ b → b, ˜a + ˜b 7→ ˜b, ˜a ∈ a, ˜b ∈ b.

It follows that 0 → a
ixy,· is the inclusion map. Therefore, E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) is an extension of a by b.

πxy,·−→ b → 0 is a short exact sequence, where

ixy,·−→ E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·)

Then a is a compatible khB+i-bimodule and ⌊ ⌋ is a factor set of b in a such

e ∼= E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = kh(A ∪ B)+|R(⌊ ⌋·)i.

Proof. Since a is an ideal of e, we have ˜θ(g)a ∈ a, (resp. a˜θ(g) ∈ a) for any
g ∈ khB+i and a ∈ A. Thus, the left (resp. right) operation is well deﬁned. It
is easy to check that a is a compatible khB+i-bimodule.

For any f ∈ R, since π(eθ(f )) = f = 0 in b, we have eθ(f ) ∈ a. Thus, ⌊ ⌋ is

(a) For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, we have

f · a = ˜θ(f )a = {⌊f ⌋a}, a · f = a˜θ(f ) = {a⌊f ⌋}.

(b) For any intersection composition (f1, f2)w, f1, f2 ∈ R, w = f1c =

each αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R, cigidi < w, then

˜θ(u)˜θ(u′) = ˜θ(uu′) =X δi ˜θ(ui) +X βj ˜θ(cj)⌊gj⌋˜θ(dj ).

Therefore, e = a ⊕eb as vector space with the multiplication: for any a, a′ ∈ A

Let S be a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khX+i. Then for any f ∈ khX+i, by
Theorem 2.1, there is a unique RedS(f ) ∈ kIrr(S) such that f = RedS(f ) in
khX+|Si, where kIrr(S) is the k-linear space spanned by Irr(S).

Let η : B → a be a map and Γη : kh(A ∪ B)+i → kh(A ∪ B)+i the
unique homomorphism such that Γη(b) = b − η(b) and Γη(a) = a for any
b ∈ B, a ∈ A. If R(⌊ ⌋′,·′) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in kh(A ∪ B)+i, then
for any g ∈ khB+i ⊆ kh(A ∪ B)+i, we have a unique RedR(⌊ ⌋′,·′ ) (g − Γη(g)) ∈ a.

By Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4, we have the following theorem which gives a com-

plete characterization of associative extensions of a by b.

Theorem 2.5 Let a be an associative algebra with a linear basis A and the
multiplication table: aa′ = {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ A, and b = khB+|Ri an associative
algebra generated by a set B with deﬁning relations R. Assume that R is a
minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khB+i with respect to a monomial order >
on B∗. Then the following two statements hold.

for any a ∈ A, b ∈ B and f ∈ R, where (⌊ ⌋, ·) (resp. (⌊ ⌋′, ·′)) is a special

commutative:

For any b ∈ B, by the commutative diagram, we have

πxy′,·′(ϕ(b)) = πxy,·(b) = b = πxy′,·′(b).

Thus, b − ϕ(b) ∈ a. Deﬁne η : B → a, b 7→ b − ϕ(b). Then, it is easy to check
that (2) and (3) are true.

(⇐=) Let eϕ : kh(A ∪ B)+i → E(a,b,⌊ ⌋′,·′) be the unique homomorphism from
kh(A ∪ B)+i to E(a,b,⌊ ⌋′,·′) such that eϕ(a) = a and eϕ(b) = b − η(b) for any
a ∈ A, b ∈ B. By (2) and (3), we have eϕ(h) = 0 for any h ∈ R(⌊ ⌋,·). Therefore,
eϕ induces a homomorphism ϕ : E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) → E(a,b,⌊ ⌋′,·′) which makes the dia-

gram (4) commutative.

2.3 Some special cases of extensions of associative alge-

bras

Let b be an associative algebra with a well-ordered linear basis B and the
multiplication table: bb′ = {bb′}, b, b′ ∈ B. It is easy to see that R = {bb′ −
{bb′}|b, b′ ∈ B} is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis with respect to the deg-lex
order on B∗.

For any b, b′ ∈ B, denote (b, b′) = ⌊bb′ − {bb′}⌋, which can be extended to be

a bilinear map (, ) : b × b → a.

By Theorem 2.5, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 2.6 Let a (resp. b) be an associative algebra with a linear basis A
(resp. B) and the multiplication table: aa′ = {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ A (resp. bb′ =

({bb′}, b′′) + (b, b′) · b′′ − (b, {b′b′′}) − b · (b′, b′′) = 0.

Now, we consider another special case of Theorem 2.5: a2 = 0.

Corollary 2.7 ([21]) Let a be an associative algebra with a linear basis A and
b = khB+|Ri, where R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in khB+i. If a2 = 0,
then an associative algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

for some b-bimodule structure in a (denote the module operation by •) and some
factor set ⌊ ⌋ : R → a of b in a such that

+

⌊f1⌋ • c − d • ⌊f2⌋ =X αici • ⌊gi⌋ • di.

Proof. (⇐=) If a2 = 0 and a is a b-bimodule with the module operation •,
then it is easy to see that a is a compatible khB+i-bimodule with the module
operation

a · g = a • (g + Id(R)), g · a = (g + Id(R)) • a, a ∈ A, g ∈ khB+i.

For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, since a2 = 0, we have

f · a = (f + Id(R)) • a = 0 = {⌊f ⌋a}, a · f = a • (f + Id(R)) = 0 = {a⌊f ⌋}.

Therefore, by Theorem 2.5, e is an extension of a by b.

(=⇒) If e is an extension of a by b, then by Theorem 2.5, a is a compatible
khB+i-bimodule and e ∼= E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) for some factor set ⌊ ⌋ : R → a such that
the conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 2.5 hold.

10

Since a2 = 0, for any f ∈ R, a ∈ A, we have

f · a = {⌊f ⌋a} = 0, a · f = {a⌊f ⌋} = 0.

Thus, a is b-bimodule with the operation:

a • (g + Id(R)) = a · g, (g + Id(R)) • a = g · a, a ∈ A, g ∈ khB+i.

It is easy to see that e ∼= E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = E(a,b,⌊ ⌋,•) and the condition (b) holds. (cid:3)

By Corollaries 2.6 and 2.7, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 2.8 ([35]) Let a be an associative algebra with a linear basis A and
b be an associative algebra with a linear basis B and the multiplication table:
bb′ = {bb′}, b, b′ ∈ B. If a2 = 0, then an algebra e is an extension of a by b if
and only if

e ∼= k*(A ∪ B)+(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2.4 Applications

In this subsection, we assume that a is an associative algebra with a well-ordered
linear basis A and multiplication table: aa′ = {aa′}, a, a′ ∈ A. Let b = khB+|Ri
with B a well-ordered set. We assume that the order on (A ∪ B)∗ is the deg-lex
order such that b > a for any b ∈ B, a ∈ A.

By Theorem 2.5 and direct computations, we have the following examples.

Example 2.9 Let b = kh{b}+|bn = f (b)i be a cyclic associative algebra, where
n is a natural number and f (b) is a polynomial of degree less than n such that
f (0) = 0. Then an associative algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= kh(A ∪ {b})+|aa′ − {aa′}, bn − f (b) − ˜a, ba − b · a, ab − a · b, a, a′ ∈ Ai

for some compatible kh{b}+i-bimodule structure in a and some ˜a ∈ a such that
for any a ∈ A,

bn · a − f (b) · a = {˜aa}, a · bn − a · f (b) = {a˜a}, bi · ˜a = ˜a · bi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

Example 2.10 Let b = khB+|bb′ − b′b, b > b′, b, b′ ∈ Bi be the free commutative
algebra on B. Then an associative algebra e is an extension of a by b if and
only if

e ∼= kh(A∪B)+|aa′ −{aa′}, ba−b·a, ab−a·b, bb′−b′b−(b, b′), a, a′ ∈ A, b, b′ ∈ Bi

11

for some compatible khB+i-bimodule structure in a and some factor set {(b, b′) ∈
a|b, b′ ∈ B, b > b′} such that for any a ∈ A and b, b′, b′′ ∈ B, b > b′ > b′′,

b · (b′ · a) − b′ · (b · a) = {(b, b′)a}, (a · b) · b′ − (a · b′) · b = {a(b, b′)},

(b′, b′′) · b + b′ · (b, b′′) + (b, b′) · b′′ − (b, b′′) · b′ − b′′ · (b, b′) − b · (b′, b′′) = 0.

3 Extensions of Lie algebras

3.1 Composition-Diamond lemma for Lie algebras

In this subsection, we review the Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for Lie algebras,
which can be found in [7, 12, 41, 44].

Let X be a set which is equipped with a well order >X and ≻ (resp. >) be
the lex order (resp. deg-lex) order on X ∗ with respect to the order >X . Let
X ∗∗ be the set of all non-associative words on X.

With the lex order ≻ on X ∗, we give the deﬁnition of Lyndon-Shirshov

words, see [7, 12, 41, 44] for details.

A nonempty word w ∈ X ∗ is called an associative Lyndon-Shirshov word
on X if w = uv, u, v 6= 1 ⇒ w ≻ vu. A non-associative word (u) ∈ X ∗∗ is a
non-associative Lyndon-Shirshov word, denoted by [u], if

(a) u is an associative Lyndon-Shirshov word;

(b) if (u) = ((u1)(u2)), then both (u1) and (u2) are non-associative Lyndon-

Shirshov words;

(c) if (u1) = ((u′

1 (cid:22) u2.

1)(u′′

1 )), then u′′

Denote ALSW (X) (resp. N LSW (X)) to be the set of all associative (resp.
non-associative) Lyndon-Shirshov words on X.

In fact, for any associative Lyndon-Shirshov word w, there is a unique brack-
eting way [w] such that [w] is a non-associative Lyndon-Shirshov word. Let khXi
be the free associative algebra with identity on X over a ﬁeld k and Lie(X) the
Lie subalgebra of khXi generated by X under the Lie bracket (uv) = uv − vu.
It is well known that Lie(X) is a free Lie algebra on X with a linear basis
N LSW (X).

Let (u) = (x1x2 · · · xm) ∈ X ∗∗, where each xi ∈ X. Denote cont(u) the

multiset {x1, x2, . . . , xm}.

Lemma 3.1 ([7, 41, 44]) For any non-associative word (u) ∈ X ∗∗, (u) has a
unique representation

(u) = α1[u1] + α2[u2] + · · · + αn[un],

where each αi ∈ k and ui ∈ ALSW (X), u1 > u2 > · · · un and cont(u) =
cont(ui).

12

For any f ∈ khXi, denote f the leading word of f with respect to the deg-lex

order > on X ∗. If [w] ∈ N LSW (X), then we have [w] = w.

If w = avb with w and v associative Lyndon-Shirshov words, then

where b = cd for some c, d ∈ X ∗. Denote

[w] = [a[vc]d],

[w]v = [w]|[vc]7→[···[[[v][c1]][c2]]···[cn]],

where c = c1c2 · · · cn, each ci is an associative Lyndon-Shirshov word and c1 (cid:22)
c2 (cid:22) · · · (cid:22) cn. Then [w]v = w.

Let s ∈ Lie(X) be a monic polynomial. If asb is an associative Lyndon-

Shirshov word, deﬁne

[asb]s = [asb]s|[s]7→s

which is called a special normal s-word.

Let f, g ∈ Lie(X) be monic. There are two kinds of compositions.
(i) If w = ¯f a = b¯g for some a, b ∈ X ∗ with | ¯f | + |¯g| > |w|, then hf, giw =
[f a]f − [bg]g is called the intersection composition of f and g with respect to
the ambiguity w.

(ii) If w = f = agb for some a, b ∈ X ∗, then hf, giw = f − [agb]g is called

the inclusion composition of f and g with respect to the ambiguity w.

If S is a monic subset of Lie(X), then the composition hf, giw is called trivial

modulo (S, w), if hf, giw =P αi[aisibi]si , where each αi ∈ k, ai, bi ∈ X ∗, si ∈

S, aisibi ∈ ALSW (X) and aisibi < w. If this is the case, then we write

hf, giw ≡ 0 mod(S, w).

A monic set S is called a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(X) if any composi-

tion hf, giw of f, g ∈ S is trivial modulo (S, w).

A Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis S in Lie(X) is minimal if there is no inclusion
composition in S. Let c = Lie(X|R) be a Lie algebra generated by X and
deﬁning relations R. Then, one can ﬁnd a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis S in
Lie(X) such that c = Lie(X|R) = Lie(X|S), see, [12].

Theorem 3.2 ([7, 41, 44]) (Composition-Diamond lemma for Lie algebras) Let
S ⊆ Lie(X) be a non-empty monic set, Id(S) the ideal of Lie(X) generated by
S and > the deg-lex order on X ∗. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) S is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(X).

(ii) f ∈ Id(S) ⇒ ¯f = a¯sb ∈ ALSW (X) for some s ∈ S and a, b ∈ X ∗.

(iii) The set

Irr(S) = {[w]|w ∈ ALSW (X), w 6= a¯sb, s ∈ S, a, b ∈ X ∗}

is a linear basis of the Lie algebra Lie(X|S) = Lie(X)/Id(S).

3.2 A characterization of extensions of Lie algebras

Let a, b be Lie algebras over a ﬁeld k.
In this subsection, by using the the
Gr¨obner-Shirshov bases theory for Lie algebras, we give a complete characteri-
zation of extensions of a by b, where b is presented by generators and relations.

Deﬁnition 3.3 Let c and d be two Lie algebras. Then c is called a compatible
d-module if c is a d-module and for any c, c′ ∈ c and d ∈ d,

d · [cc′] = [(d · c)c′] + [c(d · c′)],

where · is the d-module operation.

Let c and d be two Lie algebras and c a d-module relating to the representation
φ : d → gl(c), where gl(c) is the Lie algebra of all linear transformations of c.
Then c is a compatible d-module if and only if φ(d) is a derivation of c for any
d ∈ d.

Let a be a Lie algebra with a linear basis A and the multiplication table:
[aa′] − [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A and b = Lie(B|R) a Lie algebra generated by generators
B and deﬁning relations R.

Let > be a well order on B and extend it to a deg-lex order > on (A ∪ B)∗
such that b > a for any b ∈ B, a ∈ A. For convenience, we may assume that
R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(B) with respect to the deg-lex
order on B∗. For any f ∈ R, denote rf = f − [f ], where ¯f is the leading
word of f with respect to the deg-lex order >. Then for any f ∈ Lie(B), by
Theorem 3.2, there is a unique RedR(f ) ∈ kIrr(R) such that f = RedR(f ) in
Lie(B|R), where kIrr(R) is the k-linear space spanned by Irr(R). Note that
for any f, g ∈ Lie(B), we have

RedR((f g)) = RedR((RedR(f )g)) = RedR((RedR(f )RedR(g))).

Let ⌊ ⌋ : R → a be a map, which is called a factor set of b in a. Assume that

a is a compatible Lie(B)-module with the module operation ·.

It is easy to see that S(·) = {[ba] − b · a|a ∈ A, b ∈ B} is a Gr¨obner-

Shirshov basis in Lie(A ∪ B).
(viaiwi) ∈ (A ∪ B)∗∗, vi, wi ∈ B∗, ai ∈ A, then we can see that RedS(·)(g) ∈ a.

If g = P αi(viaiwi), where each αi ∈ k and

Deﬁne

LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = Lie(A ∪ B|LieR(⌊ ⌋,·)),

where LieR(⌊ ⌋,·) is the set consisting of the following polynomials in Lie(A∪B):

faa′ : = [aa′] − [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A, a > a′,
tba : = [ba] − b · a,
hf : = f − ⌊f ⌋,

b ∈ B, a ∈ A,
f ∈ R.

Lemma 3.4 If ((v)a) ∈ (A∪B)∗∗, v ∈ B∗, a ∈ A, then RedS(·)(((v)a)) = (v)·a.
It follows that for any f ∈ R, a ∈ A, RedS(·) ((f a)) = f · a.

14

Proof. Induction on |v|. If |v| = 0 or 1, then the result is trivial. Assume that
the result is true for (v) with |v| < n. Let |v| = n ≥ 2 and (v) = ((v1)(v2)).
Since

((v)a) = (((v1)(v2))a) = (((v1)a)(v2)) + ((v1)((v2)a))

and by induction

RedS(·)(((v1)a))) = (v1) · a, RedS(·)(((v2)a)) = (v2) · a,

we have

RedS(·)(((v)a))

= RedS(·)((((v1)a)(v2)) + ((v1)((v2)a)))
= RedS(·)((RedS(·) (((v1) · a))(v2)) + ((v1)RedS(·) (((v2) · a))))
= −(v2) · ((v1) · a) + (v1) · ((v2) · a)
= ((v1)(v2)) · (a) = (v) · a.

Therefore, RedS(·) (((v)a)) = (v) · a.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.5 Let u ∈ ALSW (B) and a ∈ A. Then in Lie(A ∪ B),

([u]a) = [ua] +X αi[viawi],

where αi ∈ k, vi, wi ∈ B∗ and viawi < ua.

Proof. By Lemma 3.1, we have

([u]a) =

nXi=1

αi[viawi],

where each αi ∈ k, vi, wi ∈ B∗ and v1aw1 > v2aw2 > · · · > vnawn. Since
([u]a) = [u]a − a[u] and [u] = u, we have ([u]a) = ua and the coeﬃcient of ([u]a)

is 1. Thus v1aw1 = ua and α1 = 1. Therefore, ([u]a) = [ua] +P αi[viawi]. (cid:3)

Lemma 3.6 With the above notations, LieR(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis
in Lie(A ∪ B) if and only if

(a) For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, f · a = [⌊f ⌋a]a in a.

(b) For any intersection composition hf1, f2iw, where f1, f2 ∈ R, w = f1c =

df2, c, d ∈ B∗ and |f1| + |f2| > |w|, if

hf1, f2iw = [f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

=X αi[cigidi]gi ,

where each αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R and cigidi < w, then in a,

RedS(·) ([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) =X αiRedS(·)([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ).

15

Moreover, if this is the case, LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) is an extension of a by b.

Proof. Since R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(B), the only possible
compositions in LieR(⌊ ⌋,·) are related to the following ambiguities:

aa′a′′, baa′, f a = vba, f1c = df2,

where f1, f2, f ∈ R, v, c, d ∈ B∗, b ∈ B, a, a′, a′′ ∈ A, a > a′ > a′′ and
|f1| + |f2| > |f1c|.

If w = aa′a′′, then hfaa′ , fa′a′′ iw ≡ 0 mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w) by the Jacobi

identity.

If w = baa′, then since a is a compatible Lie(B)-module, we have

htba, faa′iw = [tbaa′]tba − [bfaa′]faa′

= (([ba] − b · a)a′) − (b([aa′] − [aa′]a))
= ([ba]a′) − ((b · a)a′) − [b[aa′]] + [b[aa′]a]
≡ [[ba′]a] − [(b · a)a′]a + [b[aa′]a]
≡ −[a(b · a′)]a − [(b · a)a′]a + b · [aa′]a
≡ 0 mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w).

If w = f a = vba, then by Lemma 3.5,

([ ¯f ]a) = ([vb]a) = [vba] +X αi[viawi],

where each αi ∈ k, vi, wi ∈ B∗, and viawi < w. Thus, by Lemma 3.4,

[f ] · a = [vb] · a = RedS(·) (([ ¯f ]a)) = RedS(·) ([vba]) +X αiRedS(·) ([viawi]).

Therefore, by Lemma 3.4,

hhf , tbaiw = [(f − ⌊f ⌋)a]f − [v([ba] − b · a)]tba

= ([f ]a) + (rf a) − (⌊f ⌋a) − [v[ba]] + [v(b · a)]tba

≡ X αiRedS(·) ([viawi]) + rf · a − [⌊f ⌋a]a + RedS(·) ([vba])

≡ [vb] · a + rf · a − [⌊f ⌋a]a
≡ f · a − [⌊f ⌋a]a mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w).

Then hhf , tbaiw ≡ 0 mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w) if and only if f · a = [⌊f ⌋a]a.
If w = f1c = df2, f1, f2 ∈ R, c, d ∈ B∗ and |f1| + |f2| > |w|, then

hhf1 , hf2 iw = [(f1 − ⌊f1⌋)c]f1
− [df2]f2

= [f1c]f1

− [d(f2 − ⌊f2⌋)]f2
+ ([d⌊f2⌋]f2

− [⌊f1⌋c]f1

).

Since R is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(B), we have

hf1, f2iw = [f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

=X αi[cigidi]gi,

16

where each αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R and cigidi < w. Therefore,

hhf1 , hf2 iw

= X αi[ci(gi − ⌊gi⌋)di]gi +X αi[ci⌊gi⌋di]gi + [d⌊f2⌋]f2
≡ X αi[ci⌊gi⌋di]gi + [d⌊f2⌋]f2
≡ X αiRedS(·)([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ) − RedS(·) ([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [⌊f1⌋c]f1

Then hhf1 , hf2iw ≡ 0 mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w) if and only if

− [⌊f1⌋)c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) mod(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·), w).

RedS(·) ([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) =X αiRedS(·)([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ).

Therefore, LieR(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis if and only if the conditions

(a) and (b) hold.

If LieR(⌊ ⌋,·) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis, then by Composition-Diamond
lemma for Lie algebras, we have that Irr(LieR(⌊ ⌋,·)) = A ∪ Irr(R) is a linear
basis of LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·), where Irr(R) = {[w]|w ∈ ALSW (B), w 6= c¯rd, r ∈
R, c, d ∈ B∗}. Therefore, LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = a ⊕ b as linear space with the following
multiplication: for any a, a′ ∈ A and [u], [u′] ∈ Irr(R),

[(a+[u])(a′+[u′])] = [aa′]a−[u′]·a+[u]·a′+X δi[ui]+X βjRedS(·)([cj⌊gj⌋dj]fj
where ([u][u′]) =P δi[ui] +P βj[cjgjdj]gj in Lie(B) with each δi, βj ∈ k, [ui] ∈

Irr(R), cj , dj ∈ B∗, gj ∈ R.

It is easy to see that a is an ideal of LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·). Deﬁne

),

πxy,· : LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = a ⊕ b → b, ˜a + ˜b 7→ ˜b, ˜a ∈ a, ˜b ∈ b.

πxy,·−→ b → 0 is a short exact se-
It follows that 0 → a
quence, where ixy,· is the inclusion map. Therefore, LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = Lie(A ∪
B|LieR(⌊ ⌋,·)) is an extension of a by b.
(cid:3)

ixy,·−→ LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·)

Let e be an extension of a by b, i.e., 0 → a

π→ b → 0 is a short exact
sequence, where i is the inclusion map. For any b ∈ B, choose a ˜b ∈ e such
that π(˜b) = b in b. Let ˜θ : Lie(A ∪ B) → e be the unique homomorphism from
Lie(A ∪ B) to e such that ˜θ(b) = ˜b and ˜θ(a) = a for any a ∈ A, b ∈ B.

i→ e

Lemma 3.7 Let e is an extension of a by b, i.e., 0 → a
short exact sequence. Deﬁne the Lie(B)-module operation · by

i→ e → b

π→ 0 is a

g · a = [˜θ(g)a], g ∈ Lie(B), a ∈ A

and

⌊ ⌋ : R → a, f 7→ ˜θ(f ).

Then, a is a compatible Lie(B)-module and ⌊ ⌋ is a factor set such that the
conditions (a) and (b) in Lemma 3.6 hold. Moreover, e ∼= Lie(A∪B|LieR(⌊ ⌋,·)).

17

Proof. Since a is an ideal of e, we have [˜θ(g)a] ∈ a for any g ∈ Lie(B) and
a ∈ A. Thus, the operation · is well deﬁned.
It is easy to see that a is a
compatible Lie(B)-bimodule.

For any f ∈ R, since π(eθ(f )) = f = 0 in b, we have eθ(f ) ∈ a. Thus, ⌊ ⌋ is

well deﬁned. Let (vaw) ∈ (A ∪ B)∗∗, v, w ∈ B∗, a ∈ A. Then, it is easy to see
that RedS(·)((vaw)) = ˜θ((vaw)). Therefore, we have

(a) For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, f · a = [˜θ(f )a] = [⌊f ⌋a]a.
(b) For any intersection composition hf1, f2iw, where f1, f2 ∈ R, w = f1c =

df2, c, d ∈ B∗ and |f1| + |f2| > |w|, if

hf1, f2iw = [f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

=X αi[cigidi]gi,

where each αi ∈ k, gi ∈ R and cigidi < w, then

0 = ˜θ([f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

= ˜θ([⌊f1⌋c]f1
= RedS(·) ([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

−X αi[cigidi]gi )

−X αi[ci⌊gi⌋di]gi )

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) −X αiRedS(·) ([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ).

Lie(B), where each δi, βj ∈ k, cj, dj ∈ B∗, [ui] ∈ Irr(R), gj ∈ R, then

Let ˜θ(Irr(R)) = {˜θ([u])|[u] ∈ Irr(R)} andeb the subspace of e spanned by
˜θ(Irr(R)). For any [u], [u′] ∈ Irr(R), if ([u][u′]) =P δi[ui] +P βj[cjgjdj]gj in
[˜θ([u])˜θ([u′])] = ˜θ(([u][u′])) = X δi ˜θ([ui]) +X βj ˜θ([cjgjdj]gj )
= X δi ˜θ([ui]) +X βjRedS(·)([cj ⌊gj⌋dj]gj ).
Therefore, e = a ⊕eb as linear space with the multiplication: for a, a′ ∈ A

and [u], [u′] ∈ Irr(R),

[(a + ˜θ([u]))(a′ + ˜θ([u′]))]

ϕ : LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = a⊕ b → e = a⊕eb, a 7→ a, [u] 7→ ˜θ([u]), a ∈ A, [u] ∈ Irr(R).

Remark: By Lemma 3.7, for a given extension 0 → a

π→ b → 0, it is
πxy,·−→ b → 0, where · is
equivalent to some extension 0 → a
a compatible Lie(B)-module operation on a and ⌊ ⌋ is a factor set such that
the conditions (a) and (b) in Lemma 3.6 hold. If this the case, we call (⌊ ⌋, ·) a
special extension pair associated to the extension 0 → a

Let η : B → a be a map and Γη : Lie(A ∪ B) → Lie(A ∪ B) be the
unique homomorphism such that Γη(b) = b − η(b) and Γη(a) = a for any
b ∈ B, a ∈ A. If LieR(⌊ ⌋′,·′) is a Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(A ∪ B), then for
any g ∈ Lie(B) ⊆ Lie(A ∪ B), we have RedLieR(⌊ ⌋′,·′ )(g − Γη(g)) ∈ a.

By Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7, we have the following theorem which gives a com-
plete characterization of extensions of a by b, where b is presented by generators
and relations.

Theorem 3.8 Let a be a Lie algebra with a linear basis A and the multiplication
table: [aa′] = [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A and b = Lie(B|R), where R is a minimal Gr¨obner-
Shirshov basis in Lie(B). Then, the following two statements hold.

(I) A Lie algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′] − [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A
[ba] − b · a,
f − ⌊f ⌋,

b ∈ B, a ∈ A
f ∈ R



for some compatible Lie(B)-module structure in a (denote the module op-
eration by ·) and some factor set ⌊ ⌋ : R → a such that

(a) For any a ∈ A, f ∈ R, f · a = [⌊f ⌋a]a in a.

(b) For any intersection composition hf1, f2iw, where f1, f2 ∈ R, w =

f1c = df2, c, d ∈ B∗ and |f1| + |f2| > |w|, if

hf1, f2iw = [f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

=X αi[cigidi]gi ,

where each αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R and cigidi < w, then in a,

RedS(·) ([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) =X αiRedS(·)([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ).

(II) Two extensions e and e′ of a by b are equivalent if and only if there exists

a map η : B → a such that

b ·′ a − b · a = [η(b)a]a,
⌊f ⌋′ − ⌊f ⌋ = RedLieR(⌊⌋′,·′ ) (f − Γη(f ))

in a for any a ∈ A, b ∈ B and f ∈ R, where (⌊ ⌋, ·) (resp. (⌊ ⌋′, ·′)) is a
special extension pair associated to e (resp. e′).

Proof. (I) This part follows from Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7.
(II) Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.5 (II).

3.3 Some special cases of extensions of Lie algebras

Let b be a Lie algebra with a well-ordered linear basis B and the multiplication
[bb′] − [bb′]b, b, b′ ∈ B. It is easy to see that R = {[bb′] − [bb′]b|b, b′ ∈
table:
B, b > b′} is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(B) with respect to the
deg-lex order on B∗.

Deﬁne (b, b′) = ⌊[bb′] − [bb′]b⌋, b, b′ ∈ B, which can be extended to be a

skew-symmetric bilinear map (, ) : b × b → a.

Therefore, we have the following corollary by Theorem 3.8 and a direct

computation.

Corollary 3.9 ([2]) Let a (resp. b) be a Lie algebra with a linear basis A
(resp. B) and the multiplication table: [aa′] = [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A (resp.
[bb′] =
[bb′]b, b, b′ ∈ B). Then, a Lie algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′] − [aa′]a,
[ba] − b · a,
[bb′] − [bb′]b − (b, b′),

a, a′ ∈ A,
b ∈ B, a ∈ A
b, b′ ∈ B



for some compatible Lie(B)-module structure in a (denote the module operation
by ·) and some skew-symmetric bilinear map (, ) : b × b → a such that for any
b, b′, b′′ ∈ B and a ∈ A,

[bb′] · a − [bb′]b · a = [(b, b′)a]a,

b · (b′, b′′) − ([bb′]b, b′′) + b′ · (b′′, b) − ([b′b′′]b, b) + b′′ · (b, b′) − ([b′′b]b, b′) = 0.

Corollary 3.10 Let a be an abelian Lie algebra with a linear basis A and b =
Lie(B|R), where R is a minimal Gr¨obner-Shirshov basis in Lie(B). Then a Lie
algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,•) = LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′],
[ba] − b • a,
f − ⌊f ⌋,

a, a′ ∈ A,
b ∈ B, a ∈ A
f ∈ R



for some b-module structure in a (denote the module operation by •) and some
factor set ⌊ ⌋ : R → a of b in a such that

(b) For any intersection composition hf1, f2iw, where f1, f2 ∈ R, w = f1c =

df2, c, d ∈ B∗ and |f1| + |f2| > |w|, if

hf1, f2iw = [f1c]f1

− [df2]f2

=X αi[cigidi]gi ,

where each αi ∈ k, ci, di ∈ B∗, gi ∈ R and cigidi < w, then

RedS(•)([⌊f1⌋c]f1

− [d⌊f2⌋]f2

) =X αiRedS(•)([ci⌊gi⌋di]gi ).

20

Proof. (=⇒) By Theorem 3.8, we have a is a compatible Lie(B)-module
and e ∼= LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) for some factor set ⌊ ⌋ : R → a of b in a such that the
conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.8 hold.

Since a is abelian, we have f · a = [⌊f ⌋a]a = 0 for any f ∈ R and a ∈ A.

Thus, a is a b-module with the operation

(g + Id(R)) • a = g · a, g ∈ Lie(B), a ∈ A.

(⇐=) Deﬁne the operation

g · a = (g + Id(R)) • a, g ∈ Lie(B), a ∈ A.

Since a is abelian, we have

g · [aa′]a = 0 = [g · a, a′]a + [a, g · a′]a

Thus, a is a compatible Lie(B)-module. Moreover, for any f ∈ R and a ∈ A,

f · a = (f + Id(R)) • a = 0 = [⌊f ⌋a]a.

Therefore, the conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.8 hold. It is easy to see that
e ∼= LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,·) = LieE(a,b,⌊ ⌋,•). It follows that e is an extension of a by b by
Theorem 3.8.
(cid:3)

By Corollaries 3.9 and 3.10, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 3.11 ([22]) Let a be an abelian Lie algebra with a linear basis A
and b be a Lie algebra with a linear basis B and the multiplication table: [bb′] =
[bb′]b, b, b′ ∈ B. Then a Lie algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

[aa′],
[ba] − b • a,
[bb′] − [bb′]b − (b, b′),

a, a′ ∈ A,
b ∈ B, a ∈ A
b, b′ ∈ B



e ∼= LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for some b-module structure in a (denote the module operation by •) and some
skew-symmetric bilinear map (, ) : b × b → a such that for any b, b′, b′′ ∈ B,

b • (b′, b′′) − ([bb′]b, b′′) + b′ • (b′′, b) − ([b′b′′]b, b) + b′′ • (b, b′) − ([b′′b]b, b′) = 0.

3.4 Applications

In this subsection, we give some applications of the Theorem 3.8 and its corol-
laries.

Example 3.12 Let a be a Lie algebra with a linear basis A and the multiplica-
tion table: [aa′] = [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A, and b = Lie(B|f = 0), a one relation Lie
algebra, where B is a set and f ∈ Lie(B). Then a Lie algebra e is an extension
of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′] − [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A,
[ba] − b · a,
f − ⌊f ⌋,

b ∈ B, a ∈ A



21

for some compatible Lie(B)-module structure in a and some ⌊f ⌋ ∈ a such that
for any a ∈ A, f · a = [⌊f ⌋a]a.

Especially, if a is abelian, then e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′],
[ba] − b • a,
f − ⌊f ⌋,

a, a′ ∈ A,
b ∈ B, a ∈ A



for some b-module structure in a and some ⌊f ⌋ ∈ a.

Proof. Noting that there is no composition in R = {f }, R = {f } is a Gr¨obner-
Shirshov basis in Lie(B). By Theorem 3.8, we can obtain the result.
(cid:3)

Example 3.13 Let a be a Lie algebra with a linear basis A and the multipli-
[aa′] = [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A, and b = sl(2, k) = Lie(B|R), the three
cation table:
dimensional simple Lie algebra, where B = {x, y, h} and R = {[xy] − h, [hx] −
2x, [hy] + 2y}. Then a Lie algebra e is an extension of a by b if and only if

e ∼= LieA ∪ B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[aa′] − [aa′]a, a, a′ ∈ A,
[xa] − x · a, [ya] − y · a, [ha] − h · a, a ∈ A

[xy] − h − (x, y), [hx] − 2x − (h, x), [hy] + 2y − (h, y) 

for some compatible Lie(B)-module structure in a and some skew-symmetric
bilinear map (, ) : b × b → a such that for any a ∈ A,

[xy] · a − h · a = [(x, y)a]a,

[hx] · a − 2x · a = [(h, x)a]a,
[hy] · a + 2y · a = [(h, y)a]a,

h · (x, y) + x · (y, h) + y · (h, x) = 0.

Proof. By Corollary 3.9, we can get the result.
