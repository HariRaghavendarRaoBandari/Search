Abstract – The scattering of matter wave solitons on attractive potentials enables one to populate
bound states, a feature impossible with noninteracting wave packets. Compared to noninteracting
states, the populated states are renormalized by the attractive interactions between atoms and
keep the same topology. This renormalization can even transform a virtual state into a bound
state. Our numerical studies show how such scattering experiments can reveal and characterize
the surface states of a periodic structure whose translational invariance has been broken. Our
proposal can be implemented with current experimental techniques.

Introduction. – The development of cold atom
physics has led to many new advances in the recent past.
In particular, the new ﬁeld of atom optics using propaga-
tive matter waves achieved impressive advances, enabling
to realize with cold atoms many features previously devel-
oped in optics, such as quantum reﬂection, beam splitters
or Bragg reﬂection on optical lattices [1].

However, an important diﬀerence with optics is that
cold atoms can be prepared in regimes where interaction
is important.
In this case, the physics of the system in
the mean ﬁeld approximation is described by the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation [2, 3]. This equation is nonlinear con-
trary to the usual Schr¨odinger equation. As such, it pos-
sesses for attractive interactions special types of solutions
called solitons. In contrast with wave packets of the usual
linear Schr¨odinger equation which spread with time, the
variance of solitons in free space remains constant. Soli-
tons are known in classical physics in many contexts, es-
pecially ﬂuid mechanics [4–6]. In the ﬁeld of dilute Bose-
Einstein condensates, they have been predicted theoreti-
cally [5–7] and observed experimentally with rubidium-85
and lithium-7 atoms in various forms [8]: gray, bright and
band-gap solitons.

In the present paper, we wish to put forward a useful
aspect of these many-body wave functions.
Indeed, the
scattering of solitons can be used to probe virtual and/or
bound states in various potentials through scattering ex-
periments, revealing structures which cannot be observed
with an interaction-free wave packet.
Indeed, in many-

body wave packets part of the energy corresponds to the
interaction energy and this creates a new freedom which
can be used to populate such states. It has been shown
already theoretically that soliton scattering on some po-
tentials was able to detect and characterize the energy
of some bound states associated to localized defects [9],
square potentials [10], impurity modes [11, 12] and lattice
defects [13]. Solitons were also studied as tools for in-
terferometry [14]. Some recent experiments have started
the investigation of the scattering of solitons on short-size
potential wells [15].

In ﬁnite-size optical lattices, which are commonly con-
structed in cold atom experiments, the presence of bound-
aries at the edge of the potential breaks the translational
invariance and results in the existence of surface states.
They have been characterized and studied in condensed
matter since a long time [16, 17], and are of great impor-
tance in several areas such as semiconductor physics. In
this paper, we will show how to observe and characterize
such surface states through the scattering of solitonic wave
packets.

First, we present the scattering of a soliton on a single
well. We then extend the results on a collection of identical
wells corresponding to a ﬁnite-size lattice potential which
can be easily created by interfering laser beams in cold
atom experiments, and discuss the observation of surface
states.

solitons described by the following 1D Gross-Pitaevskii

Single potential well. – As a ﬁrst example, we study
in the following the scattering of a soliton on a single well.
We choose as potential the restriction of a sinusoidal op-
tical lattice to a single period:

U (x) = −U0 cos2(cid:16) πx

d (cid:17) for − d/2 ≤ x ≤ d/2,

(3)

whose ﬁrst derivative is everywhere continuous. For nu-
merical simulations, we use a typical experimental value
d = 0.65µm.
In the absence of interactions, the poten-
tial (3) exhibits bound states whose number depends on
the relative depth U0/ER with ER = 2k2
R/(2m) and
kR = 2π/d. For noninteracting wave packets, such bound
states cannot be populated in a scattering experiment.
Only indirect signatures of virtual or/and bound states
exist e.g. scattering resonances and even zero-energy res-
onances [18], or the transparency eﬀect commonly referred
to as the Ramsauer-Townsend eﬀect.

Scattering of an interacting wave packet on such a
potential cannot be described as usual through asymp-
totic distributions at large distances since trapping is also
present. This is illustrated by our numerical simulations
presented in Fig. 1, where a soliton of mean velocity ¯v
launched from the left splits into three parts in the course
of the scattering. For t < 36 ms, the reﬂected part moves
to the left and expands, indicating that the corresponding
density has no solitonic character, the interaction energy
being too small to compensate for the kinetic energy. An-
other part is transmitted and propagates without spread-
ing, indicating that another soliton has been formed with
a fraction of the original atoms. At last, a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the atoms remains trapped for a long time in the
potential well.

In order to separate these three parts, we consider the
wave function probability of presence in three diﬀerent

and N = 9000 atoms, onto potential (3) of depth U0 = 0.5ER.

and T (t) = R ∞

−∞ dx|ψ(x)|2, C(t) = R d/2
d/2 dx|ψ(x)|2.

−d/2 dx|ψ(x)|2
In this way, for suﬃciently
long times R(t) will contain only the reﬂected part, T (t)
the transmitted part, and C(t) will quantify the fraction
of atoms which remains conﬁned in the potential after the
scattering process.

Figure 2(a) shows the trapped part of the probability
for long time as a function of the number of atoms N and
the potential depth U0. Depending on these parameters,
this trapped part can vary over a large span of values,
with thresholds that appear for certain critical values of
the potential depth. The threshold values are related to
the appearance of a bound states inside the well. The
bound states keep the topology (number of nodes) of their
interaction-free counterpart but are renormalized by the
attractive interactions. The threshold values observed for
populating renormalized bound states are thus below the
values corresponding to the appearance of a bound state
without interaction (see Fig. 2(b)). A remarkable con-
sequence of such a renormalization lies therefore in the
possibility of populating virtual states whose energy are
slightly positive and become negative as a result of the
dressing of the state by the attractive interactions.

With the use of the Feshbach resonance such as in the
case of lithium-7 atoms [3], it is possible to cancel out the
interactions. We implement this process in our simula-
tions by switching oﬀ the interactions adiabatically from
t = 36 ms. As a result, a fraction of the wave function

leaves the potential well, but part of the atoms remain
in the well for long time (see Fig. 1 and inset of Fig. 3).
This trapped part coincides with the noninteracting bound
state of the potential well (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). For the
speciﬁc example we are considering, it is possible to popu-
late state by state each bound state. This occurs because
the energy diﬀerence between two adjacent bound states
remains large compared to the negative energy stored in
the interactions.

Finite-size lattice: surface states. – In this sec-
tion, we study the scattering of a soliton on a ﬁnite-size
lattice. Such a lattice can be produced by interfering
two mutually coherent laser beams. We ﬁrst consider the
following periodic potential with a square envelope (see

Fig. 3: (color online) Atomic density at t = 50 ms inside the
potential well from the numerical dynamics (light blue/gray
solid line), compared to the (normalized to one) square modu-
lus of the fundamental eigenstate of the well with interaction
(dark blue/gray) and the one without interaction (black line).
The dashed blue line which is perfectly superimposed to the
black line corresponds to the numerical trapped distribution
once renormalized to unity. The inset plot represents the vari-
ation of the part of the density inside the potential well C(t) as
a function of time. The switch oﬀ of the interactions yields a
small decrease of the trapped fraction. The interacting bound
states were calculated using the split operator method in imag-
inary time.

In inﬁnite periodic potentials, Bloch theory states that
the eigenvalues are grouped into bands separated by gaps
and correspond to extended states. However, for ﬁnite-
size systems such as (4) additional states appear that are
localized at the potential edges. Contrary to the gener-
alization of Bloch states to such ﬁnite-size lattices, which
are exponentially decreasing but only outside the lattice,
the surface states decrease exponentially on both sides of
the potential edge. In the limit of shallow potentials (small
U0/ER) they have been characterized in [16] and are called
Shockley states, whereas in the limit of deep potentials
(large U0/ER) they have been described in [17] and are
called Tamm states. Both states are bound states and ap-
pear inside the gaps separating the bands of Bloch states.
At positive energy, other analogous states appear as reso-
nances. These three kind of surface states are illustrated
in Fig. 4.

In our numerical experiment, we launch a soliton on
potential (4). We observe a great variety of behaviors de-
pending on the soliton total energy and the depth of the
potential: the wave packet can be reﬂected, transmitted
across the lattice, or trapped at the boundary. As previ-
ously, we relate these behaviors to the presence or absence
of bound states which can trap the soliton at a given en-
ergy. We thus expect that if a surface state is present the
soliton can be trapped at the potential edge.

Such a phenomenon is visible in Fig. 5 (a). After scat-
tering of the soliton on the ﬁnite-size lattice potential, part
of the wave packet is reﬂected, part is transmitted, but a
substantial fraction of the atoms remain trapped at the
potential edge for long time. In order to conﬁrm that the
trapped part corresponds to a true surface state, we adi-
abatically switch oﬀ the interactions at t = tprop = 150
ms 1. The result is shown in Fig. 5 (b): the ﬁnal wave
function on the potential edge coincides exactly with the
left half of a true surface state, with exponential decrease
of the envelope on both sides of the potential edge.

The envelope of potential (4) has two discontinuities.
To validate the experimental feasibility of our study, it
is worth exploring how the preceding results are modiﬁed
when the discontinuities are smoothened over a length ς
(see Fig. 6 (a)):

The corresponding energy spectrum is shown on Fig. 6
(b). One recovers the results of the preceding paragraphs
for ς → 0: a single bound surface state is visible in the gap.
When ς increases, this particular state remains unchanged,
but more and more additional surface states leave the
bands and go inside the gap. This conﬁrms the existence

1The depth of the potential has also been lowered in order to
induce a fast disappearance of the components of the wave packets
that are contaminated by the extended states.

envelope.

We have numerically simulated the scattering of a soli-
ton on such a potential. Reﬂected and transmitted waves
are still present and a substantial part of the atoms re-
mains trapped. A closer look to the trapped part reveals
the presence of a beating pattern (see Fig. 7). Indeed, the
presence of several surface states with small energy diﬀer-
ences in the gap makes possible the trapping of the atoms
in a superposition of surface states. The frequency of this
beating pattern is directly related to the energy diﬀerence
between the surface states populated, and allows to re-
alize a direct spectroscopy of these states. We note that
the topology (number of nodes) of the states are preserved

Conclusion. – In this paper, we have shown that the
scattering of solitonic wave packets built from interacting
atoms can be used to probe and populate virtual and/or
bound states of potentials, which could not be performed
in the absence of interactions. We have shown that in the
case of a single well potential, it is possible to detect the
bound states of the potential and to trap a fraction of the
atoms in the well for speciﬁc values of the potential depth.
The threshold where the interacting atoms are trapped
appears below the bound state energy for noninteracting
atoms. The adiabatic switch oﬀ of the interaction enables
one to make the density converge to the correct noninter-
acting bound state, starting from interacting atoms.

These results can be extended to the case of surface
states appearing at the potential edge of a ﬁnite-size opti-
cal lattice. In the experimentally relevant case of a slowly
varying enveloppe, where we have shown that many sur-
face states are present, it is possible to trap the atoms
on a superposition of surface states and use the beating
pattern of the wave function to perform a spectroscopy of
these states.

Our study thus shows that the scattering of solitons is
a versatile tool to probe the structure of potentials; the
imaging of the wave function allows to obtain spectro-
scopic information as well as density information, on both
interacting or noninteracting bound states. Experimental
realization of such a proposal requires to realize a guided
soliton with a low mean velocity and an optical lattice with
a steep variation of its envelope. These requirements are
achievable with state of the art experimental techniques
