Nonuniform C-section Phasers

Abstract—We show that a continuously nonuniform coupled-
the step-
line C-section phaser, as
discontinuous coupled-line multisection commensurate and non-
commensurate phasers, provides enhanced bandwidth and di-
versity in real-time analog signal processing (R-ASP). The phe-
nomenology of the component is explained in comparison with the
step-discontinuous using multiple-reﬂection theory and a simple
synthesis procedure is provided. The bandwidth enhancement
results from the suppression of spurious group delay harmonics
or quasi-harmonics, while the diversity enhancement results from
the greater level of freedom provided by the continuous nature
of the nonuniform proﬁle of the phaser. These statements are
supported by theoretical and experimental results.

Index Terms—C-sections, phaser, group delay engineering,
nonuniform transmission line, real-time analog signal processing.

I. INTRODUCTION

Real-time Analog Signal Processing (R-ASP) is a potential
alternative to dominantly digital radio technology, given its
high-speed, low-consumption and frequency-scalability ben-
eﬁts [1]. The key component of a R-ASP system is the
phaser [1], [2]1, a device providing speciﬁed group delay
versus frequency response depending on the application, e.g.
linear for real-time Fourier transformers [3], staircase for spec-
trum sniffers [4] and Chebyshev for dispersion code multiple
access (DCMA) [5], [6].

Step-discontinuity coupled-line all-pass phasers represent a
common type of phasers [1], [2], [7], [8], but they suffer from
bandwidth restriction, due to the presence of spurious group
delay harmonics, and restricted dispersion diversity, in R-ASP.
This paper shows how these limitations can be mitigated by
using continuously nonuniform C-section phasers [6] as the
subwavelength section limit of step-discontinuity multi-section
coupled-line phasers [8].

Figure 2(a) shows that the group delay response of a single
C-section is periodic, with peaks located at βD = π(n+ 1/2),
for n = 0, 1, ..., ∞ and having a group delay swing depending
on the coupling, C, and length, D, of the structure. Figure 2(b)
shows that in a commensurate cascaded M -section C-section,
the periodicity is increased by a factor M (M propagation-
coupled resonators) with up to M peaks depending on cou-
plings, due to coherent multiple reﬂection [factor e−j2mβd in
Eq. (2)]. Deﬁning BWmax as the frequency bandwidth support-
ing a non-periodic speciﬁed group delay response (restricted
by periodicity), one has from 2βd = 2π where d = D/M
that BWmax = M v/4D. This reveals that the bandwidth of
the phaser is increased by increasing M . Finally, Fig. 2(c)
shows that periodicity is lost in the case of non-commensurate
sections, due to coherent multiple reﬂection [factor e−j2mβdm
in Eq. (2)].

III. CONTINUOUSLY MODULATED NONUNIFORM PHASERS
To synthesize the nonuniform coupled-line function C(z)
(0 < Cmin < C(z) < Cmax < 1) for the speciﬁed group delay
response, one may use the Fourier series expansion

C(z) = a0 +

coefﬁcients aq
and bq. The corresponding nonuniform
even
are
odd
Z0e/o(z) = Z0(p1 ± C(z))/(1 ∓ C(z)) [9]. We shall satisfy
∀z,
the local matching condition, pZ0e(z)Z0o(z) = Z0,
where Z0 is the ports characteristic impedance. The even and
odd impedances at the input of the mth subsection, Zin
p,m, are
related to those of the (m + 1)th subsection, Zin
p,m+1, by

impedances

Iteratively computing Zin
p,m from m = M to m = 1 pro-
vides the even and odd reﬂection coefﬁcients at the input
of the overall even and odd structures via Γin
p,1 −
Z0)/(Zin
p,1 +Z0). The corresponding group delay of the phaser
follows using (3), and is injected into the ﬁtness function

p = (Zin

F = 1/(ωh − ωl)R ωh

with the speciﬁed function τs(ω).

ωl (cid:12)(cid:12)τ (ω) − τs(ω)(cid:12)(cid:12) dω, for alignment of τ (ω)

Figure 3 compares the performance of the continuously
modulated nonuniform phaser with those of step-discontinuity
nonuniform phasers. The goal is to a achieve negative linearly
chirped response of at least 30 ps swing over the largest
possible bandwidth between 1 and 20 GHz2. Due to its zero
subsection length (d/λ → 0), the continuously modulated
phaser exhibits, according to Sec. II, an inﬁnite periodicity,
and reaches therefore the complete speciﬁed bandwidth. In
contrast, the bandwidth of the step-discontinuous phasers is
restricted by spurious peaks due to excessive subsection length.
The oscillations in the group delay curves, more visible in
the continuously nonuniform case due to smaller large-scale
variations, correspond to the resonances of the overall C-
section structures (βD = π, i.e. ∆f = 1.11 GHz). These
oscillations may be suppressed by using cascaded non-uniform
C-sections, which also allows to increase the group delay
swing, as shown in Fig. 4.

Let us ﬁnally demonstrate the dispersion diversity of the
phaser by specifying 1st order to 4th order Chebyshev group
delay responses. This beneﬁts comes from the virtually un-
limited degrees of freedom of the continuously nonuniform
structure, in contrast to its super-wavelength step-discontinuity

ﬁle diversity compared to step-discontinuity coupled-line C-
section phasers. Such a phaser, that may be further cascaded
for oscillation suppression and delay swing enhancement, is
a promising device for in real-time analog signal processing
(R-ASP). It may be for instance applied to Dispersion Code
Multiple Access (DCMA), a recently proposed novel multi-
plexing wireless technology [5], where the number of channels
is equal to the number of available phaser responses and cross-
channel interference is minimized using Chebyshev dispersion
proﬁles.
