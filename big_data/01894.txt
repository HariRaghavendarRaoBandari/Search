FAITHFUL COMPLETELY REDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF

MODULAR LIE ALGEBRAS

DONALD W. BARNES

Abstract. Let L be a Lie algebra of dimension n over a ﬁeld F of character-
istic p > 0. I prove the existence of a faithful completely reducible L-module
2
of dimension less than or equal to pn

−1.

1. Introduction

Let L be a Lie algebra of dimension n over the ﬁeld F . The Ado-Iwasawa
Theorem asserts that there exists a faithful ﬁnite-dimensional L-module V . There
are several extension of this result which assert the existence of such a module V
with various additional properties. See, for example, Hochschild [3], Barnes [1].
Of importance for this paper is Jacobson’s Theorem, [4, Theorem 5.5.2] that every
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra L over a ﬁeld F of characteristic p > 0 has a ﬁnite-
dimensional faithful completely reducible module V . None of these results sets a
bound to the dimension of V , unlike the Leibniz algebra analogue [2] which asserts
for a Leibniz algebra of dimension n, the existence of a faithful Leibniz module of
dimension less than or equal to n + 1. The main purpose of this paper is to prove
the following strengthening of Jacobson’s Theorem.

Theorem 1.1. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0 and let L be a Lie algebra
of dimension n over F . Then L has a faithful completely reducible module V with
dim(V ) ≤ pn2−1.

In all that follows, F is a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0 and L is a Lie algebra of

dimension n over F .

2. Restricted Lie algebras.

A restricted Lie algebra (see [4, Chapter 2]) is a Lie algebra L together with a
p-operation, that is, a map [p] : L → L such that for a, b ∈ L and λ ∈ F , we have
ad(a[p]) = ad(a)p, (λa)[p] = λpa[p] and

(a + b)[p] = a[p] + b[p] +

For convenience of reference, we list here some properties of p-operations.

Lemma 2.1. Let (L, [p]) be restricted Lie algebra. Then

(1) If [a, b] = 0, then [a[p]r
(2) If [a, b] = 0, then (a + b)[p] = a[p] + b[p].
(3) For all a, b ∈ L, we have si(a, b) ∈ L′.

, b[p]s

] = 0. In particular, [a[p]r

, a[p]s

] = 0.

Proof. (1) Since ad(a)b = 0, ad(a)pr
implies that [b[p]s

, a[p]r

] = 0.

b = 0, that is, [a[p]r

, b] = 0. But [b, a[p]r

] = 0

(2) Since ad(a ⊗ X + b ⊗ 1)(a ⊗ 1) = 0, we have si(a, b) = 0 for all i.
(3) Follows immediately from the deﬁnition.

(In fact, by [4, Lemma 2.1.2],
(cid:3)

si(a, b) ∈ Lp.)

Lemma 2.2. Let (L, [p]) be a restricted Lie algebra and let A be an abelian ideal
of L. Then there exists a p-operation [p]′ on L such that a[p]′

= 0 for all a ∈ A.

Proof. Take a basis {a1, . . . , ar} of A and extend this to a basis {a1, . . . , an} of L.
Put bi = a[p]
. For i = 1, . . . , r, we have ad(ai)2 = 0. We replace these bi with 0. By
i
Jacobson’s Theorem [4, Theorem 2.2.3], there exists a p-operation [p]′ on L such
that a[p]′
j = bj for j > r). From Lemma 2.1(2), it
then follows that a[p]′
(cid:3)

i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , r (and a[p]′
= 0 for all a ∈ A.

Corollary 2.3. Let (L, [p]) be a restricted Lie algebra. Then there exists a p-
operation [p]′ on L such that every abelian minimal ideal of L is a [p]′-ideal.

Proof. The abelian socle ASoc(L) is the sum of all the abelian minimal ideals of L.
It is an abelian ideal. By Lemma 2.2, there exists a p-operation [p]′ which is zero
on ASoc(L), and so, on every abelian minimal ideal. Thus every abelian minimal
ideal is a [p]′-ideal.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.4. Let (L, [p]) be a restricted Lie algebra of dimension n over the
ﬁeld F of characteristic p. Then L has a faithful completely reducible module of
dimension less than or equal to pn−1.

Proof. By Corollary 2.3, we may suppose that every abelian minimal ideal is a
[p]-ideal. The result holds for n = 1. We use induction over n.

Suppose that A1, A2 are distinct minimal [p]-ideals of L. Then L/Ai is a re-
stricted Lie algebra. Since dim(L/Ai) ≤ n − 1, L/Ai has a faithful completely
reducible module Vi with dim(Vi) ≤ pn−2. But V1 ⊕ V2 is a faithful completely
reducible L-module and dim(V1 ⊕ V2) ≤ 2pn−2 ≤ pn−1.

Suppose that A is the only minimal [p]-ideal of L. Let B ⊆ A be a minimal
ideal of L. The representation of L on B is a [p]-representation and its kernel K
is a [p]-ideal. Either K = 0 or K ⊇ A. If K = 0, then B is a faithful completely
reducible L-module and the result holds. So we may suppose that K ⊇ A. But this
implies that B is abelian. By our choice of [p], this implies that B is a [p]-ideal and
so, that B = A. Hence we may assume that our only minimal [p]-ideal A is also a
minimal ideal and is abelian.

We can take a linear map c : L → F such that c(A) 6= 0. Let W = hwi be the
1-dimensional A-module with the action aw = c(a)w for all a ∈ A. Then W has
character c|A. We form the c-induced module V = u(L, c) ⊗u(A,c|A) W . See [4,
Chapter 5]. By [4, Proposition 5.6.2], dim(V ) = pdim(L/A) ≤ pn−1. Let V0 be the
direct sum of the composition factors of V . Then dim(V0) ≤ pn−1. Note that A

FAITHFUL COMPLETELY REDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF MODULAR LIE ALGEBRAS3

acts non-trivially on V0 since it acts non-trivially on the irreducible A-submodule
1 ⊗ W of V . If V0 is faithful, the result holds.

So suppose that V0 is not faithful. Then there exists a minimal ideal B whose
action on every composition factor of V is trivial. Then B is represented on V
by nilpotent linear transformations. But V is faithful, so by Engel’s Theorem for
algebras of linear transformations, B is nilpotent. But B′ is an ideal of L, so we
must have B′ = 0. By our choice of [p], B is a [p]-ideal of L, contrary to A being
the only minimal [p]-ideal of L. Therefore V is faithful.

3. Minimal p-envelopes.

Let (Le, [p]) be a minimal p-envelope of L. We investigate dim(Le). Note that,
by [4, Theorem 2.5.8], dim(Le) is independent of the choice of minimal p-envelope.
Let Z be the centre of Le. By [4, Theorem 2.5.8], Z ⊆ L. From [4, Lemma 2.5.5
(1)], it follows that (Le)′ ⊆ L.

Lemma 3.1. Let A be an ideal of L. Then A is an ideal of Le.

Proof. The set {x ∈ Le | ad(x)A ⊆ A} is a [p]-subalgebra of Le and contains L. (cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. Let a1, . . . , ar ∈ Le and λ1, . . . , λr ∈ F . Then

for some k ∈ L.

Proof. From the deﬁnition of a p-operation, we have (λiai)[p] = λp
. The result
holds for r = 2 by Lemma 2.1(3) since (Le)′ ⊆ L. So (λ1a1 + · · · + λrar)[p] =
(λ1a1 + . . . λr−1ar−1)[p] + λp
r + k1 for some k1 ∈ L. But by induction, (λ1a1 +
1a[p]
· · · + λr−1ar−1)[p] = λp
r−1 + k2 for some k2 ∈ L. The result
follows.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.3. Let x ∈ L and let V = hx[p]i
the x[p]i

Proof. We have ad(x)Le ⊆ L. The maps ad(x[p]i

So they span a subspace of Hom(L, L) of dimension at most n. For some r ≤ n − 1,
the maps ad(x)|L, ad(x[p])|L, . . . , ad(x[p]r

Theorem 3.4. Let L be a Lie algebra of dimension n over the ﬁeld F of charac-
teristic p > 0 and let A be an abelian ideal of L with dim(A) = d. Let (Le, [p]) be
a minimal p-envelope of L. Then dim(Le) ≤ n(n − d + 1).

Proof. We choose a basis {e1, . . . , en} of L with e1, . . . , ed ∈ A. By Lemma 2.2, we
may suppose that a[p] = 0 for all a ∈ A. Then the e[p]j
i = 0 for i ≤ d. Let V be the
subspace of Le spanned by the e[p]j
(including j = 0). Then V ⊇ L. By Lemma
3.3, dim(V /L) ≤ n(n − d) giving dim(V ) ≤ n(n − d + 1). But (Le)′ ⊆ L, so V is a
subalgebra of Le. By Lemma 3.2, v[p] ∈ V for all v ∈ V . Thus V is a p-envelope of
L, so V = Le.
(cid:3)

i

We can now prove Theorem 1.1.

4. The main result.

Proof. We use induction over n. Suppose that A1, A2 are distinct minimal ideals
of L. Then L/Ai has a faithful completely reducible module Vi with dim(Vi) ≤
p(n−1)2−1 and V1 ⊕ V2 is a module satisfying all the requirements. So suppose
that A is the only minimal ideal of L. If A is non-abelian, then A is an L-module
satisfying the requirements, so suppose that A is abelian.

1 ⊆ V A

0 , we have V A

We take a minimal p-envelope (Le, [p]) of L. As dim(A) ≥ 1, by Theorem 3.4,
we have dim(Le) ≤ n2. By Theorem 2.4, Le has a faithful completely reducible
module V with dim(V ) ≤ pn2−1. There is some irreducible summand V0 of V on
which A acts non-trivially. By Lemma 3.1, A is an ideal of Le and it follows that
V A
0 := {v ∈ V0 | Av = 0} is an Le-submodule of V0. Therefore V A
0 = 0. Let V1 be
an irreducible L-submodule of V0. Since V A
1 = 0. But A is the
only minimal ideal of L. As it is not in the kernel of the representation of L on V1,
V1 is a faithful L-module.
(cid:3)
Remark 4.1. We have a function f : N → N, namely f (n) = pn2−1, such that every
Lie algebra of dimension n over a ﬁeld of characteristic p has a faithful completely
reducible module of dimension less than or equal to f (n). We cannot replace this
with a function independent of p. The smallest faithful completely reducible module
for the non-abelian algebra of dimension 2 has dimension p. This does not rule out
the possibility, if we drop the requirement of complete reducibility, of there being a
function f independent of p such that every Lie algebra of dimension n over a ﬁeld
of non-zero characteristic has a faithful module of dimension less than or equal to
f (n).
