In inﬂation with nonminimal derivative coupling there is not a conformal transformation to the
Einstein frame where calculations are straightforward, and thus in order to extract inﬂationary
observables one needs to perform a detailed and lengthy perturbation investigation. In this work we
bypass this problem by performing a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis, namely rewriting the cosmological
equations considering the scalar ﬁeld to be the time variable. We apply the method to two speciﬁc
models, namely the power-law and the exponential cases, and for each model we calculate various
observables such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the spectral index and its running. We compare
them with 2013 and 2015 Planck data, and we show that they are in a very good agreement with
observations.

INTRODUCTION

After more than three decades of extensive investiga-
tion, the inﬂationary paradigm is considered to be a nec-
essary part of the Standard Model of cosmology, solving
some of its earlier crucial problems, such as the ﬂatness,
the horizon and the monopole ones [1–6]. Additionally,
inﬂation is needed in order to obtain the correct behavior
of primordial ﬂuctuations and a universe with a nearly
scale-invariant density power spectrum [7–12], as well as
with the correct amount of tensor perturbations [13–23].

In principle there are two main ways that one can ob-
tain the realization of the inﬂationary paradigm. The
ﬁrst direction is to use a modiﬁcation of the gravita-
tional sector [24–26] (for a review see [27]), acquiring a
modiﬁed cosmological behavior that allows for inﬂation-
ary solutions. The most well known scenario in this ap-
proach is the Starobinsky inﬂation [3], in which one adds
in the Einstein-Hilbert action a term quadratic in the
Ricci scalar. The second direction is to introduce new,
exotic forms of matter, capable of driving inﬂation even
in the framework of general relativity. In this approach
one usually adds a canonical scalar ﬁeld, assuming it to
take large values (for instance in chaotic inﬂation [28])
or small values (for instance in new and natural inﬂa-
tion [29, 30]), a phantom ﬁeld [31–34], a tachyon ﬁeld
[35–37], or scenarios like k-inﬂation [38, 39] and ghost
inﬂation [40].

Apart from the above simple inﬂationary realizations,
one could construct models of both contributions, namely
models where the extra scalar ﬁeld couples to gravity in

a more complicated way than the usual minimal cou-
pling. The simplest class of such scenarios is when the
scalar ﬁeld is non-minimally coupled to gravity, and in-
deed these “scalar-tensor” theories present very interest-
ing cosmological behavior [41–48]. However, an interest-
ing class of models is obtained if one extends further these
constructions by allowing for non-minimal couplings be-
tween the curvature and the derivatives of the scalar ﬁeld
[49], which can lead to novel and interesting cosmological
features [50–69]. Finally, even more complicated exten-
sions can arise considering Galileon and Horndeski the-
ories [70–72] or even bi-scalar and multi-scalar construc-
tions [73–75].

In the most studies of inﬂationary cosmology one im-
poses the usual slow-roll approximation, and tries to ex-
tract expressions for basic inﬂationary-related observ-
ables, such as the scalar and tensor spectral indices,
the running spectral index, and the tensor-to-scalar ra-
tio. Nevertheless, there is an alternative approach which
allows for an easier derivation of many inﬂation re-
sults, namely the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation [76]. In
this formalism, one rewrites the cosmological equations
by considering the scalar ﬁeld to be the time variable,
which is always possible during the slow-roll era, where
the scalar varies monotonically (the extension to the
post-inﬂationary, oscillatory epoch is straightforward by
matching together separate monotonic epochs [77]). We
mention here that in the usual approach it is more con-
venient to transform to the Einstein frame, where calcu-
lations are signiﬁcantly easier, and hence this approach
cannot be easily applied to models where there is not a
conformal transformation to such a frame, such as the
nonminimal derivative coupling constructions. Hence, in
such cases we expect the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to
be more convenient and signiﬁcantly easier.

In this work we are interested in performing the
Hamilton-Jacobi analysis for inﬂation with nonminimal
derivative couplings. The plan of the work is as follows:

In Section II we brieﬂy review inﬂation with nonmini-
mal derivative coupling and then we apply the Hamilton-
Jacobi formulation. Then in Section III we apply it to
two speciﬁc models, namely the power-law and the ex-
ponential cases. We calculate various observables such
as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the spectral index and
its running, and we compare them with the Planck data.
Finally, Section IV is devoted to ﬁnal remarks and con-
clusion.

II. HAMILTON-JACOBI FORMALISM FOR

INFLATION WITH NONMINIMAL DERIVATIVE

COUPLING

In this section we will construct the Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism for inﬂation with nonminimal derivative cou-
pling. We ﬁrst give a brief review of cosmology with
nonminimal derivative couplings, and then we proceed
to the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation.

A.

Inﬂation with nonminimal derivative coupling

Let us start with the inﬂation realization in cosmology
with nonminimal derivative couplings. The action of such
a theory reads as [49, 54]

where Gµν = Rµν − 1
scalar Ricci, MP =q 1

2 gµνR is the Einstein tensor, R the
8πG the reduced Planck mass, and
M is the coupling constant with dimension of mass. Since
in this work we focus on the inﬂationary application of
this theory, we have neglected the matter and radiation
contents. Variation of the above action in terms of the
metric gives rise to the ﬁeld equations

where ∇(µφRα

variation of the action (1) with respect to φ provides the

scalar ﬁeld equation of motion, namely

(cid:20)gµν +

M 2 Gµν(cid:21) ∇µ∇ν φ = V ′(φ),

2

(3)

where V ′(φ) ≡ dV (φ)/dφ.
In order to investigate the cosmological applications of
the above theory, we focus on a spatially-ﬂat Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker (FRW) background geometry of the
form

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t) δij dxidxj ,

(4)

where t is the cosmic time, xi are the comoving spatial
coordinates and a(t) is the scale factor. In this case the
ﬁeld equations (2) give rise to the two Friedmann equa-
tions, namely

H 2 =

ρφ

(6)

with H = ˙a/a the Hubble parameter (a dot denotes dif-
ferentiation with respect to t), and where we have in-
troduced the eﬀective energy density and pressure of the
scalar ﬁeld respectively as

ρφ =

Similarly, the scalar-ﬁeld equation of motion (3) becomes

M 2! ˙φ + V ′(φ) = 0.

(9)
Note that using the deﬁnitions of ρφ and Pφ we can
re-write this equation in the usual conservation form,
namely

˙ρφ + 3H(Pφ + ρφ) = 0.

(10)

Finally, we stress here that, as it is well known, the equa-
tions of motion do not contain higher-order time deriva-
tives, and thus the theory at hand is ghost free [49, 54].
Lastly, since in this work we focus on the inﬂation re-
alization, we restrict ourselves to the high friction regime
[56, 60] where H 2/M 2 ≫ 1, and we impose the slow-roll
conditions, namely H2
˙φ2 ≪ V (φ), ¨φ ≪ H ˙φ. Hence, the
M 2

tion equation (9) respectively become

B. Hamilton-Jacobi formalism

Let us now formulate the Hamilton-Jacobi approach
to inﬂation with nonminimal derivative couplings. We
ﬁrst describe brieﬂy the main idea of Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism [76]. In this approach of a cosmological sys-
tem, one uses the scalar ﬁeld as a time variable, and hence
the Friedmann equation gives rise to a partial diﬀerential
equation for the Hubble parameter. Thus, concerning in-
ﬂation, one imposes the slow-roll conditions, and then by
choosing suitable ansatzes he can extract analytical solu-
tions, as well as explicit expressions for the inﬂationary
observables. Note that the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is
very eﬃcient since it can bypass the extensive calcula-
tions that are needed in the usual approach, especially in
the case where the transformation to the Einstein frame
(where calculations are easier) is impossible, such is the
case of cosmology with nonminimal derivative couplings.
We mention that in order for this procedure to be self-
determined, we need a monotonically varying scalar ﬁeld,
which is indeed the case during the slow-roll era. Even
for the post-inﬂationary case, where the scalar ﬁeld is
expected to oscillate, one can still apply the Hamilton-
Jacobi formalism, by matching together separate mono-
tonic epochs [77].

We now apply the above into the slow-roll inﬂationary
cosmological equations (11) and (12). First of all, we can
combine them in order to obtain the useful relation

˙φ ≈ −

3

M 2M 2
P H ′(φ)
H 2

.

(13)

As we observe, it is obvious that if H ′(φ) < 0 (H ′(φ) > 0)
then the scalar ﬁeld increases (decreases) over time. Now,
inserting (13) into the ﬁrst Friedmann equation we are
led to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, namely

[H ′(φ)]2 −

H 6(φ)

equal to one marks the end of inﬂation, i.e. inﬂation ends
when

H 4(φ) =

2
3

[H ′(φ)]2 .

(18)

Combining relations (13) and ˙a = ˙φa′, we can extract

the scale factor as

a(t) = a0 exp(cid:20)−

3

2Z M −2

P M −2 H 3(φ)
H ′(φ)

dφ(cid:21) ,

(19)

where a0 is an integration constant. Thus, the e-folding
number, which describes the amount of expansion during
the inﬂation, can be calculated as

N ≡Z te

H(t)dt =Z φe

(20)

where the subscripts “i” and “f” denote the initiation
and end of inﬂation.

III. APPLICATIONS

In the previous section we presented the Hamilton-
Jacobi formulation of inﬂation with nonminimal deriva-
tive couplings. Hence, in this section we can proceed to
the investigation of speciﬁc applications, considering spe-
ciﬁc ansatzes for the Hubble function. In particular, in
the following subsections we consider the power-law and
the exponential cases separately.

A. Hubble parameter as power-law function

Let us ﬁrst examine the case where the Hubble param-

eter is a power-law function of the scalar ﬁeld, namely

H(φ) = αφn,

(21)

= 0 .

(14)

where α and n are the model parameters. In this case
Eq. (13) becomes

Thence, we can express the potential in terms of the
scalar ﬁeld as

V (φ) = 27M 2

P H 2(φ)

18M 2

P M 2[H ′(φ)]2[9H 2(φ) + M 2]

H 4(φ)

−

.

(15)

We now introduce the slow-roll parameters [56, 76]

ǫ(φ) ≡

η(φ) ≡

,

2

H 2(φ)(cid:19)2
3(cid:18) H ′(φ)
3(cid:18) H ′′(φ)
H 3(φ)(cid:19) ,

1

(16)

(17)

which as usual are both much smaller than unity during
slow-roll inﬂation. Moreover, the time when ǫ becomes

˙φ ≈ −

2
3

M 2M 2
P n

,

(22)

and thus substituting into (15) we acquire the potential
as

V (φ) = 27M 2

P α2φ2n

n2

−18M 2

P M 2

α2φ2(n+1) (cid:2)9α2φ2n + M 2(cid:3) . (23)

Additionally, the slow-roll parameters (16),(17) respec-
tively become

ǫ(φ) ≡
η(φ) ≡

2n2
3α2 φ−2(n+1) ,
n(n − 1)

3α2

φ−2(n+1) .

(24)

(25)

Therefore, imposing ǫ(φ) = 1 provides the scalar ﬁeld at
the end of inﬂation as

φe =(cid:18) 2n2
3α2(cid:19)

2(n+1)

(26)

obtain

P N − 1

+

32M 2M 2
P N
1 − 12M 2M 2

nS,

(31)

and

while using (20) we can calculate the value of the scalar
ﬁeld at the beginning of inﬂation in terms of the e-folding
number as

nT = −

2(2M 2M 2

(cid:2)2N (n + 1)M 2M 2

P + n(cid:3)

1

2(n+1) . (27)

We can now use the above expressions in order to cal-
culate the inﬂationary-related observables, namely the
scalar and tensor spectral indices, and the tensor-to-
scalar ratio respectively as [68]

which prove to be very useful, since they allow us to con-
front our model predictions straightaway with the data.
Note that the parameter n does not appear in the ﬁnal
parametric expressions, which is very good since it de-
creases the number of free ﬁtting parameters to just the
coupling constant M .

Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is de-

ﬁned as

nS − 1 ≃ 2η(φi) − 8ǫ(φi)

2(n + 1)N M 2M 2

we can use (28), (33) and (34) in order to express αS as

Planck 2013 results is behind the Planck 2015 results, hence
we mark its boundary by a dotted curve), on nS − r plane.
Additionally, we depict the predictions of our scenario, for
the power-law case (21), for M = 0.7 and M = 0.9 in MP
units, with the e-folding value N being 50 and 60.

as a function of nS, namely

(36)
In order to present these features more transparently,
in Fig. 1 we present the predictions of our scenario for
two choices of M , with the e-folding value N being 50
or 60, on top of the 1σ and 2σ contours of the Planck
2013 results [79] as well as of the Planck 2015 results
[80]. As we observe, the scenario at hand is in very good
agreement with observations. Additionally, in Fig. 2 we
depict the predictions of the scenario at hand for the
running spectral index αS for n = 2 and two choices of
M , with the e-folding value N being 50 or 60, on top of
the 1σ and 2σ contours of the Planck 2013 results [79] as
well as of the Planck 2015 results [80]. The agreement
with observations is very satisfactory.

Finally, in order to provide a picture of the scalar po-
tential, we use expression (23) and in Fig. 3 we depict
V (φ) for various values of M , α and n. In this Figure
we have focused on the φ-values in which φi according to
(27) and φe according to (26) lie.

nS − r plane, on top of the 1σ and 2σ contours of the
Planck 2013 results [79] as well as of the Planck 2015 re-
sults [80]. As we mentioned above, according to relation
(47) the predictions of our scenario do not depend on β,
q and N , however they are still in agreement with obser-
vations. Furthermore, in Fig. 5 we show the predictions
of the scenario at hand for the running spectral index αS
with the e-folding value N being 50 or 60, on top of the
1σ and 2σ contours of the Planck 2013 results [79] as well
as of the Planck 2015 results [80]. According to relation

we depict the predictions of our scenario, for the exponential

FIG. 6: The scalar potential V (φ) according to expression
(39), for the exponential case (37), for M = 0.1, β = 0.5,
q = 0.5 (black-solid), for M = 0.1, β = 0.3, q = 0.5 (red-
dashed), and for M = 0.1, β = 0.5, q = 0.1 (blue-dotted). All
quantities are measured in MP units.

(50) the model predictions depend only on N , however
they are in very good agreement with observations.

Lastly, in order to give a picture of the scalar potential,
we use expression (39) and in Fig. 6 we show V (φ) for
various values of M , β and q.
In this Figure we have
focused on the φ-values in which φi according to (43)
and φe according to (42) lie.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we have investigated inﬂation with
nonminimal derivative coupling through the Hamilton-
Jacobi formalism. In the majority of inﬂationary mod-
els one can perform the conformal transformation to the
Einstein frame, where the calculation of inﬂationary ob-
servables is straightforward, however in inﬂation with
nonminimal derivative such a transformation is absent
and thus a detailed and lengthy perturbation analysis is
needed in order to provide inﬂationary observables that
could be compared with the data. Hence, in such a case
the Hamilton-Jacobi analysis proves to be a very conve-
nient method to extract the scenario prediction for vari-
ous observables.

In the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism one rewrites the cos-
mological equations by considering the scalar ﬁeld to
be the time variable, which is always possible during
the slow-roll era, where the scalar varies monotonically
(the extension to the post-inﬂationary, oscillatory epoch
is straightforward by matching together separate mono-
tonic epochs). We have performed such an analysis in in-
ﬂation with nonminimal derivative coupling, and we have
applied it to two speciﬁc models for the Hubble function,
namely the power-law and the exponential cases. For
each model we have calculated various observables such
as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the spectral index and
its running, and we have compared them with the Planck
data.

For the case of power-law form we have shown that the
tensor-to-scalar ratio and the tensor spectral index have
a linear dependence on the scalar spectral index, with its

7

properties depending on the model parameters and the
e-folding number, and confrontation with 2013 and 2015
Planck results shows a very good agreement. Addition-
ally, the predictions for the running spectral index are
also in very good agreement with the data. Finally, for
transparency we have provided the corresponding proﬁle
of the scalar potential.

For the case of exponential form the tensor-to-scalar
ratio and the tensor spectral index have a linear depen-
dence on the scalar spectral index too, however not de-
pending on the model parameters or the e-folding num-
ber. Nevertheless, the predictions are in good agreement
with observational data. The behavior of the running
spectral index is more complicated, but still in very good
agreement with the Planck results.

The above features reveal that the Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism can be very eﬃcient in analyzing inﬂationary
models which do not allow for a conformal transforma-
tion to the Einstein frame. And indeed, its application
shows that inﬂation with nonminimal derivative coupling
is in agreement with observations and thus it can be a
good candidate for the description of Nature.
