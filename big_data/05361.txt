Abstract— This paper proposes a novel direct adaptive con-
trol method for rejecting unknown deterministic disturbances
and tracking unknown trajectories in systems with uncertain
dynamics when the disturbances or trajectories are the sum-
mation of multiple sinusoids with known frequencies, such as
periodic proﬁles or disturbances. The proposed algorithm does
not require a model of the plant dynamics and does not use
batches of measurements in the adaptation process. Moreover,
it is applicable to both minimum and non–minimum phase
plants. The algorithm is a “direct” adaptive method, in the sense
that the identiﬁcation of system parameters and the control
design are performed simultaneously. In order to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, an add–on controller is
designed and implemented in the servo system of a hard disk
drive to track unknown nano–scale periodic trajectories.

I. INTRODUCTION

Control methodologies for rejecting periodic and multi–
harmonic disturbances or tracking such trajectories have
attracted many researchers in the past two decades. There is
a multitude of applications, especially due to the dominating
role of rotary actuators and power generators, that crucially
rely on this type of control. A non–exhaustive list of these
applications include aircraft interior noise control [1], [2],
periodic load compensation in wind turbines [3], [4], wafer
stage platform control [5], [6], steel casting processes [7],
laser systems [8], milling machines [9], [10] and hard disk
drives [11], [12]. In this paper, we introduce a novel direct
adaptive control for rejecting deterministic disturbances and
tracking unknown trajectories in systems with unknown
dynamics when the disturbances or trajectories are the sum-
mation of multiple sinusoids with known frequencies. Note
that a periodic disturbance/trajectory with a known period
can be considered as a special case of the problems under
our study.

Control methods applied to this class of problems are typ-
ically categorized into two types, namely feedback methods
that are based on internal model principle (IMP) [13] and
feedforward algorithms that usually use an external model
[14] or a reference signal correlated with the disturbance
[15]. The classical form of internal model for periodic
disturbances introduces poles on the stability boundary which
can cause poor numerical properties and instability when
implemented on an embedded system with ﬁnite precision
arithmetic. Instability can also happen due to unmodeled

dynamics when the poles are on or very close to the stability
boundary [16]. Another limitation of IMP based repetitive
control is that the controller sampling frequency has to be
divisible by the fundamental frequency of the disturbance.
In general, adaptive feedforward control for this class of
problems does not have the above limitations. This type of
controllers commonly estimate a set of parameters that de-
termine the control law. The estimated parameters converge
when the system is not stochastic or the adaptation gain
is vanishing in a stationary (or cyclostationary) stochastic
system. This implies that the estimated parameters can be
frozen after convergence and the control sequence becomes
a pure feedforward action that can be stored and then looked
up without a need to feeding the error to the controller [11].
This is an important advantage over the feedback schemes
because that type of controller should be constantly in the
loop to generate the control sequence. Another advantage is
that the Bode’s sensitivity integral theorem does not hold
true, which implies that perfect rejection can be achieved
without affecting the suppression level at other frequencies.
Nevertheless, analysis of the adaptive methods is, in general,
more complex and relies on a set of assumptions that may
not hold true in many situations.

Although rejection of sinusoidal disturbances is a classical
control problem, few algorithms exist for the case that the
system dynamics is unknown and possibly time–varying.
Gradient descent based algorithms that use online identiﬁ-
cation schemes to obtain a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR)
of the plant [17] have been proposed by both control and
signal processing communities. The number of estimated
parameters in these methods is usually large since low–
order FIR models cannot mimic complex dynamics. The
harmonic steady–state (HSS) control
is another adaptive
method for rejection of sinusoidal disturbances which is easy
to understand and implement. However, it suffers from slow
convergence since it relies on averaging over batches of data
[18], [19].

This paper provides a novel direct adaptive feedforward
control that does not require a model of the plant dynamics
or batches of measurements. The proposed method does not
rely on any assumptions about the location of plant zeros and
can be applied to minimum and non–minimum phase plants.
The algorithm is a “direct” adaptive method, meaning that
the identiﬁcation of system parameters and the control design
are not separate. It will be shown that the number of adapted
parameters in this scheme is signiﬁcantly less than methods
that identify the plant frequency response when the number
of frequencies is large [19], [20], [21].

controller.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
ﬁrst formalize the problem and explain the system under our
study in section II. Mathematical preliminaries and notations
are given in section III. The algorithm derivation is presented
in section IV and simulation results for rejecting periodic
disturbances in a hard disk drive nanopositioner servo system
are illustrated in section V. Conclusion remarks and future
work form section VI.

II. PROBLEM STATEMENT

The adaptive controller proposed in this work is aimed
to be implemented in a plug–in fashion, meaning that it
is used to augment an existing robustly stable closed–
loop system in order to reject periodic disturbances (track
periodic trajectories) that are not well rejected (tracked)
by the existing controller. In this architecture, the original
controller can be designed without consideration of this
special control task. Moreover, the plug–in controller does
not alter the performance of the original control system. To
clarify this notion, we use a common Single-Input Single-
Output (SISO) plant–controller interconnection shown in
Fig. 1 as a running example. The blocks G and CF in the
ﬁgure respectively denote a linear time invariant (LTI) plant
and an LTI feedback compensator that form a stable closed–
loop sensitivity function

S :=

1

1 + GCF

.

One of the main contributions of the controller that will
be presented shortly is that it does not require the plant
and controller dynamics. Since our design does not depend
on whether the plant/nominal controller are continuous or
discrete time, we assume that both G and CF are discrete
time systems to make notations simpler. It is worth noting
that this interconnection is only a running example through
this paper and the proposed controller can be plugged to any
unknown and stable LTI system regardless of its internal
stabilization mechanism.

A general stochastic environment is considered for the sys-
tem by appending input disturbance w, output disturbance n,
and contaminating measurement noise m to our framework.
Generally, the nominal feedback controller CF is designed
to compensate for these input and output noises. The special
deterministic disturbance that should be compensated by the
adaptive controller is denoted by r, and without loss of

n(cid:88)

generality, we assume that it contaminates the plant output.
Let the adaptive controller sampling time be T . The class of
disturbances under our study can be written as

r(k) =

αi sin (ωikT + δi)

(1)

i=1

where the amplitudes, αi, and phase shifts, δi, are unknown
but the frequencies, ωi, are known.

Our objective is to synthesize an adaptive controller that
only uses the scalar–valued error signal e(k) to generate a
feedforward control uA(k) such that it perfectly compensates
for the effect of r(k) on the error signal e(k). We call it a
feedforward controller because when the system dynamics
and disturbance proﬁle are time–invariant, CA will not
depend on the error signal once the control law is learned.

III. MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATIONS
Let R(z) be the single–input single–output system (in z–
domain) from the adaptive control injection points to the
error signal e

R (z) : = G (z) S (z)

and let A(q−1) and B(q−1) be the polynomials that represent
R(·) in time–domain

R(q−1) =

We deﬁne an output disturbance, say ¯w, on R(·) and a
polynomial C(q−1) that satisﬁes

[ ¯w(k)] = R [w(k)] + S [n(k) + m(k)]

We also deﬁne ¯r(k) as a sequence on the output of R(.) that
has the same effect as r in the error signal e

¯r(k) = S [r(k)]·

When the same transfer function ﬁlters multiple input signals
i1(k), i2(k),··· , im(k), we abuse the notation and use

Consider r(k) as a general periodic signal and L(q−1)
as a discrete-time linear system. The steady state response
˜r(k) := L(q−1)[r(k)] is periodic. Moreover, when r(k) is
a linear combination of sinusoidal signals factorized similar
to (3), ˜r(k) (in steady state) consists of sinusoidals with the
same frequencies

˜r(k) = L(q−1)(cid:2)θT φR(k)(cid:3) = θT L(q−1) [φR(k)] = θT φRL(k)

A. Error Dynamics

The error sequence in time domain can be represented as
a function of the closed–loop dynamics, control signals and
disturbances

B(q−1)
A(q−1)

1

A(q−1)

e(k) =

(u(k) + uA(k)) +

¯w(k) + ¯r(k)

(8)
where u(k) is an exogenous excitation signal and ¯w(k) is an
unmeasurable wide–sense stationary sequence of indepen-
dent random values with ﬁnite moments. We assume that
the nominal feedback controller is able to stabilize the open
loop plant, i.e. A(p) has all roots strictly outside the unit
circle. Although a real dynamic system cannot be exactly
described by ﬁnite order polynomials, in most of applications

A and, B can be determined such that they give a ﬁnite vector
difference equation that describes the recorded data as well
as possible, i.e.

A(q−1) : = 1 + a1q−1 + a2q−2 + ··· + anA q−nA
B(q−1) : = b1q−1 + b2q−2 + ··· + bnB q−nB .

Without loss of generality, we assume that the relative degree
of the transfer function from the controllable input channel
to the output is 1, which implies that nA = nB. The analysis
for other non-negative relative degrees is very similar to the
sequel, but the notation would be more tedious due to dif-
ferences in vector/matrix sizes. Let A∗(q−1) := 1− A(q−1),
then the error is given by

e(k) = A∗(q−1)e(k) + B(q−1) (u(k) + uA(k))

+ ¯w(k) + A(q−1)¯r(k)

This equation can be represented purely in discrete time
domain in a vector form

and ˜r(k) := A(q−1)¯r(k). Note that two regressors, denoted
by φu(k) and φuA (k), are considered for the excitation signal
u(k) and the adaptive control uA(k) separately although they
could be combined into a unique regressor. The rationale
behind this consideration will be explained later after (19).
Since disturbance ¯r(k) is periodic and A(q−1) is a stable
ﬁlter – i.e. it operates as an FIR ﬁlter – the response ˜r(k) is
also periodic by Lemma 1

Equation (9) shows that an ideal control signal u∗
satisfy

A(k) should

B(q−1)u∗

A(k) + A(q−1)¯r(k) = 0.

(14)
Again, since B(q−1) and A(q−1) are both LTI systems and
¯r(k) contains only sinusoidal signals, the ideal control signal
u∗
A(k) has to have sinusoidal contents at frequencies equal
to ωi’s. This motivates us to decompose the ideal control
signal into

u∗
A(k) = θT

DφR(k).

By this representation of the control signal, our goal will be
to estimate θD in an adaptive manner. We deﬁne the actual
control signal as

uA(k) = ˆθT

D(k)φR(k)

(15)

where ˆθD(k) is the vector of estimated parameters that
should ideally converge to θD. As a result, the residual in
(14) when θD is replaced by ˆθD is

Proof: Refer to the discrete–time swapping lemma in

[23].
We deﬁne a new parameter vector

M (k) := ˆθT

D(k)DB + θT

(17)

where DB is a matrix similar to DA in (6), but its block
diagonal terms are formed by the magnitude and phase of

B(cid:0)e−jωiT(cid:1) rather than A(e−jωiT ). Since the vector θM (k)

corresponds to the imperfection in control synthesis, it is
called the residual parameters vector throughout this section.
Substituting the result of Lemma 2 in (16) yields
B(q−1)uA(k) + A(q−1)¯r(k)

RφR(k) + wt(k)

(18)

= ˆθT
= ˆθT
= θT

where the term θT
M (k)φR(k) corresponds to the residual error
at the compensation frequencies. The term wt(k) represents
the transient excitation caused by the variation of ˆθD(k) over

4

time. As a result, the term θT
be replaced by (18) which yields to

BφuA (k) + θT

RφR(k) in (13) can

e(k) = θT

Aφe(k) + θT

Bφu(k) + θT

M (k)φR(k) + wt(k) + ¯w(k).
(19)

Remark 1
The reason behind choosing two separate regressors for u(k)
and uA(k), as remarked earlier, is that the recent substitution
in the above equation is not feasible if the two regressors
were combined into a single regressor.

B. Parameter Adaptation Algorithm

The error dynamics shows that the information obtained
from measurements cannot be directly used to estimate ˆθD
as long as the closed loop system is unknown. We propose
an adaptive algorithm in this section that accomplishes the
estimation of the closed loop system and control synthesis
simultaneously.

Let ˆθA, ˆθB and ˆθM be the estimated parameters analogous
to (19). We denote the a–priori estimate of the error signal
at time k based on the estimates at k − 1 as
ˆy(k) = ˆθT

B(k − 1)φu(k) + ˆθT

A(k − 1)φe(k) + ˆθT

M (k − 1)φR(k).

(20)
and accordingly, the a–priori estimation error is deﬁned as

◦(k) : = e(k) − ˆy(k)

(21)

Assume that the estimates at time k = 0 are initialized by
either zero or some “good” values when prior knowledge
about the system dynamics is available. We propose the
following adaptation algorithm for updating the estimated
parameters

(22)
F (k) is a positive (semi) deﬁnite matrix with proper di-
mension and f (k) is a positive scalar. These gains, which
are usually known as learning factor or step size, can be
updated via either recursive least squares algorithm, least
mean squares type methods or a combination of them. We
use recursive least squares for the plant since the number
of coefﬁcients is usually “small”. On the other hand, for
large n, the recursive least squares algorithm requires major
computations. Therefore,
to reduce the
computations, possibly at the price of slower convergence,
by replacing the recursive least squares update law by the
stochastic gradient method. It is well known that the step
size of adaptive algorithms in stochastic environments should
converge to zero or very small values to avoid “excess error”
caused by parameter variations due to noises. Therefore,

susceptible to numerical problems. It is clear that f (k) is not
subjected to this issue since φT

positive.

C. Control Synthesis

Suppose that the parameter vector θM (k) and response
matrix DB are known at time step k. Then, a possible update
rule that satisﬁes (14) would be

0 = ˆθT
= ˆθT
ˆθT
D(k + 1) = ˆθT

D(k)DB ⇒

(23)

Here, we have used the fact that DB is a block diagonal
combination of scaled rotation matrices, which implies that
it is full rank and invertible. This is an infeasible update rule
since neither θM (k), nor DB is known. We replace these
variables by their respective estimated values and use a small
step size α in order to avoid large transient and excess error

D(k + 1) = ˆθT

Note that this update rule works as a ﬁrst order system
that has a pole at 1. In order to robustify this difference
equation we alternatively propose using a Ridge solution for
(23). More formally, we are interested in minimizing the
instantaneous cost function

Let β = 1 − αλ and the gradient of Jc(k) with respect to

Since the actual values of θM and DB are unknown, we use

ˆθD as

ˆθT
D(k + 1) = β ˆθT

D(k) − αˆθT

M (k) ˆD−1

(24)

This expression implies that a positive value of β less than
1 results in a bounded value of ˆθD in steady state as long
ˆD−1
B stays bounded. Moreover, assuming that ˆθM and
as ˆθT

This expression shows that there is a compromise between
the steady state attenuation level and robustness, and in order
to achieve both, the two gains should be chosen such that

0 < α (cid:28) β < 1.

Now that we have an update law for ˆθD(k), we have
a complete algorithm for synthesizing the control signal

Proof: Only the sketch of the proof is outlined here due
to space limitation. The method of analysis of stochastic re-
cursive algorithms developed by Ljung [24] can be deployed
to study the convergence and asymptotic behavior of the pro-
posed adaptive algorithm with update and control rules given
in (22), (24) and (15). Three sets of regularity conditions
are proposed in [24] that target the analysis of deterministic
and stationary stochastic processes. The problem under our
study cannot be exactly outlined in these frameworks since
the input signal consists of stochastic and deterministic parts,
and as a matter of fact, it is a cyclostationary stochastic
process. However, “Assumptions C” in [24] can be adopted
and generalized to this case with minor modiﬁcations. It

can be shown that these regularity conditions are satisﬁed
when the assumptions of theorem 1 are satisﬁed. Under
these regularity conditions, the results of theorem 2 in [24]
imply that the only convergence point of the system is the
stable equilibrium of the differential equation counterpart.
This equilibrium point corresponds to the actual values of
1−β
1−β+α θR. Moreover, this theorem proves that the
plant and
estimated parameters converge with probability one to this
equilibrium point which results in θM → 1−β
1−β+α θR with
probability one.
Remark 3
Assumption 2 can be satisﬁed by a broad range of gain
sequences γ(k). For instance, both regularity conditions hold
for γ(k) = C
Remark 4
Assumption 3 requires monitoring the roots of ˆA(q−1)
polynomial. This is a common issue in adaptive control
and several methods have been proposed. For instance, the
estimates can be projected to the interior of DA whenever the
poles fall out of (or on) the unit circle. Assumption 4 requires
monitoring the magnitude of polynomials B(e−jωh ) at all
compensation frequencies. The left inequality guarantees that
ˆDB is always invertible. The right inequality requires some
very rough knowledge about the plant magnitude because the
term α/(1− β) is large according to (25). Both inequalities
can be satisﬁed by projecting the estimates into the interior
of DB whenever they do not belong to DB.

kα when 0 < C < ∞ and 0 < α ≤ 1.

Assumption 5 is in general difﬁcult to verify since B(q−1)
polynomial is unknown. Based on theorem 1, the equilibrium
point of the closed loop system satisﬁes this assumption. It
can be shown that one of the factors that determines the
domain of attraction associated with this equilibrium point
is the excitation sequence u(k) intensity. This implies that
when no information about B(q−1) is available and the
estimated parameters are initialized with zeros, it may be
required to use a large excitation signal such that the domain
of attraction includes the initial values. However, a nominal
system is usually known in practice and this requirement
can be relaxed. Moreover, when the system is slowly time-
varying, it is expected that this assumption is satisﬁed with a
signiﬁcantly small excitation since the current estimates are
kept inside the domain of attraction of the slowly varying
equilibrium point.

V. EMPIRICAL STUDY

This section provides the experimental veriﬁcation of
the proposed controller. The method is used to design a
plug-in controller for tracking nano-scale unknown periodic
trajectories with high frequency spectra in hard disk drives
(HDDs).

A so-called single-stage HDD uses a voice coil motor
(VCM) for movements of the read/write heads [25]. The
block diagram in Fig. 1 can be adopted for this mechatronic
system in track-following mode. The blocks G and CF refer
to the VCM and the nominal feedback controller respectively.

rithm in the empirical study.

The signals w, r, n and m denote the (unknown) airﬂow dis-
turbance, repeatable runout (RRO), non-repeatable runout
(NRRO) and measurement noise respectively. The measured
position error signal (PES) is denoted by e. The design
of CF is not discussed here, and it is assumed that this
compensator can robustly stabilize the closed loop system
and attenuate the broad band noises w, n and m (c.f. [26],
[27]). The plug–in controller that will be explained shortly
targets the RRO (r) which consists of sinusoids. An exact
dynamics of the actuators is not known for each individual
HDD. Furthermore, temperature variations and deterioration
over time can introduce more uncertainties [28]. We do
not use any information about the system dynamics or the
feedback controller. In other words, everything is unknown
to us except the position error signal (PES).

Bit patterned media (BPM) is an emerging magnetic
recording technology in which each data bit is recorded
on a single magnetic island in a gigantic array patterned
by lithography on the disk. This makes the servo system
a crucial component, and introduces signiﬁcant new com-
plexity. BPMR requires that the data tracks be followed
with signiﬁcantly more accuracy than what is required in
conventional continuous media recording since the head has
to be accurately positioned over the single–domain islands
in order to read or write data. Unknown track shapes results
in written–in runout which becomes repeatable (RRO) from
the controller sight of view when the disk spins – i.e. r
in Fig. 1. In our setup, RRO has narrow–band contents at
the HDD spinning frequency (120Hz) and its 173 higher
harmonics. In other words, n in (1) is 174,
ωi(rad/s) = i × 120(Hz) × 2π
(26)
and system sampling frequency is 41.760KHz (120Hz ×
348).

i = 1,··· , 174,

A. Computer Simulation Results

The magnitude response of the closed loop dynamics from
the VCM input to the PES decays notably after 2KHz,
which makes the VCM at frequencies above 7KHz inef-
fective. Accordingly, we only focus on tracking the ﬁrst 58
harmonics (120Hz, 240Hz, ..., 6960Hz) in the design of CA
in Fig. 1. The remaining 115 harmonics should be allocated
to a higher bandwidth actuator which is beyond the scope of
this paper and is considered as one of our future work.
The design parameters of the adaptive control algorithm
are listed in Table I. The estimated coefﬁcients for A(q−1)
and B(q−1) that construct ˆθA and ˆθB are shown in Fig. 2.
The ﬁgure shows that the estimated parameters converge
to “some” values quickly. In order to evaluate the con-
vergence point, we generated the transfer function ˆB(q−1)
ˆA(q−1)

this (5th order) transfer function is compared to the actual
transfer function of the VCM loop (a realistic 50th order
model) in Fig. 3. The shaded strip indicates the compensation
frequency interval where the adaptive controller was active.
The estimated residue parameters, ˆθM , are depicted in
Fig. 4. The plot shows that the residual disturbance converges
towards zero as the algorithm evolves. This can be veriﬁed in
frequency domain based on the spectrum of error too. The
amplitude spectrum of the error before and after plugging
the adaptive controller to the closed loop servo system are
depicted in Fig. 5. For clearness, the ﬁgure only shows the
amplitude of the error Fourier transformation at compensa-
tion frequencies.

Fig. 6: Feedforward control signal, uA(k), learned by the
adaptive controller.

As mentioned earlier, the control signal uA learned by
the controller is periodic. Figure 6 depicts one period of this
signal, which can be saved as one period of a repetitive feed-
forward control sequence that is able to perfectly compensate
the ﬁrst 58 harmonics.

VI. CONCLUSION

A novel direct adaptive control method for the rejection
of disturbances or tracking trajectories consisted of multiple
sinusoidals with selective frequencies was proposed. The
method is applicable to both minimum and non-minimum
phase linear systems with unknown dynamics. The adapted
parameters converge to the real values when a large enough
excitation signal is injected to the system. In the presence
of some rough knowledge about the system dynamics, the
excitation signal can be reduced considerably. The analysis
in this paper was performed for linear time-invariant systems.
However, similar results can be extended to systems with
slowly time–varying parameters.

We veriﬁed the effectiveness of the proposed control
algorithm in tracking unknown nano–scale periodic trajec-
tories in hard disk drives by designing an add–on repetitive
controller that was able to track the ﬁrst 58 harmonics of
the disk spinning frequency. Full spectrum compensation
was impossible in our running example due to the VCM
limited bandwidth. This issue can be addressed by deploying
a dual–stage mechanism that has a high–bandwidth actuator
in conjunction with the VCM. Extension of the proposed
