On synchronization and consensus patterns in complex networks: from

analysis to control

Mario di Bernardo1,2, Davide Fiore1 and Giovanni Russo3

Abstract— Over the past few years, the study of the mech-
anisms to achieve consensus and synchronization in complex
networks has attracted the interest of the Scientiﬁc Community.
Most of the results on synchronization and consensus are
obtained under the assumption that some form cooperation
occurs between the nodes. Unfortunately, this assumption is not
satisﬁed in many instances of systems from Nature and Tech-
nology. For example, biochemical and social networks are often
characterized by some form of antagonism between nodes. The
same happens for complex networked control systems where
agents need to optimize conﬂicting utility functions. In this pa-
per, we present new conditions for the onset of synchronization
and consensus patterns in complex networks. Essentially, we
show that if network nodes exhibit some symmetry, then this
can be potentially translated into a synchronization/consensus
pattern, where two groups of nodes emerge. Interestingly, the
symmetry at the node level is also reﬂected at the network level
as the trajectories of the two groups are related with each other
via this symmetry. We also show that our results can be turned
into a design tool and offer a systematic methodology to address
the problem of designing a network controller that drives the
network towards a desired synchronization/consensus pattern.

I. INTRODUCTION

Network control is of utmost importance in many ap-
plication ﬁelds, from computer science to power networks,
internet of things and systems biology [1], [2]. In particular,
over the past few years there has been considerable interest
in the problem of steering the dynamics of network agents
towards a coordinated behavior, see e.g. [3] and references
therein. Synchronization and consensus are two examples
where all the agents of the network collaborate in order to
all converge towards the same behavior, [4], [5], [6].

Often, in applications, interactions between neighboring
network nodes are not all collaborative as there might
be certain nodes that have antagonistic relationships with
neighbors. This is the case, for example, of social networks,
where network agents might have different opinions [7],
biochemical and gene regulatory networks, where interac-
tions between nodes are either activations or inhibitions [8].
Similar antagonistic interactions also arise in technological
systems, where the Internet of Things revolution is allowing
us to create increasingly complex systems. In such systems, a
number of objects is often asked to collect ﬁeld information

and maximize different (often conﬂicting) utility functions. A
remarkable example of this instance is given in [9], where a
distributed system for charging electric vehicles is developed
with the goal of balancing multiple utility functions.

A convenient way for modeling different roles and re-
lationships between a network is given by signed graphs,
[10]. Motivated by applications, recently a large body of
Literature emerged within both the Physics and Control
Theoretical communities, which focuses on the study of the
dynamics of these networks. For example, in [11], partial
synchronization of R¨ossler oscillators over a ring is studied
via the Master Stability Function (MSF), while in [12] the
same phenomenon is studied within the broader framework
of the symmetries intrinsic to the network structure (see also
[13] for a discussion between the interplay between sym-
metries and synchronization). Symmetries are also exploited
in [14], where the MSF is used to detect the emergence of
synchronized clusters. The study of consensus dynamics over
signed graphs has also recently attracted many researchers.
A particularly interesting problem is the one considered
in [15], where sufﬁcient conditions are given for a signed
network to achieve a form of agreed upon dissensus. The
model proposed in [15] has been also used in a number
of applications, like ﬂocking [16] and extended to the case
of Linear Time Invariant systems, discrete-time integrator
dynamics and time-varying topologies, see e.g. [17], [18],
[19], [20], [21].

In this paper, we introduce new results ensuring that a
given network exhibits a synchronization/consensus pattern.
We start with presenting a sufﬁcient condition ensuring that
a network of nonlinear nodes exhibits a synchronization
pattern where two groups of nodes emerge. Speciﬁcally, we
will show that, if network nodes exhibit some symmetry, then
this can be translated into a synchronization pattern, where
two groups of nodes emerge. Interestingly, the symmetry at
the node level is also reﬂected at the network level as the
synchronous trajectories of the two groups are related with
each other via this symmetry.

We then turn our attention to consensus problems. Specif-
ically, we introduce a sufﬁcient condition ensuring that a
bipartite consensus pattern arises. The patterns that we will
consider represent a wider class than the one studied in the
papers mentioned above. In fact, with our approach we can
consider complex consensus patterns, where a group of nodes
converges to the average of the initial conditions, while the
other group converges to a different value, which is function
of this average.

Essentially, our conditions imply that,

in order for a

network to achieve some bipartite synchronization/consensus
pattern, the nodes dynamics and the network topology need
to be well blended together. In particular, as shown in
this paper, the nodes dynamics need to accommodate some
symmetry and this has to be reﬂected at the network level.
The communication protocols between nodes then need to
drive the network state towards the desired synchroniza-
tion/consensus state. Guidelines can be given for these con-
ditions to happen and we show that our results can be turned
into a design tool. We will present a systematic methodology
that, given some bipartite synchronization/consensus pattern,
allows to design the network so that this desired pattern is
effectively attained.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results via two
applications. We ﬁrst consider the problem of analyzing
the onset of anti-synchronization in a network of FitzHugh-
Nagumo oscillators and then, we show how our results can
be used to design a desired bipartite consensus pattern.

The paper is organized as follows. We start with Section
II by introducing the notation and the mathematical tools
used in the paper. In Section IV and Section V we present
two sufﬁcient conditions ensuring the onset of a bipartite
synchronization/consensus pattern. Then, in Section VI we
provide a methodology to design network controllers so
that a network exhibits a desired bipartite synchronization.
Finally, in Section VII, an application is considered which
shows the effectiveness of our results.

II. MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES

A. Notation

Throughout this paper, we will denote by In the n × n
identity matrix, with 0n the n × n matrix having all of its
elements equal to 0 and by 1n the n-dimensional column
vector having all of its elements equal to 1. The orthogonal
group will be denoted by O(n).

B. Complex networks

In this paper, we will consider a connected network of
N > 1 smooth n-dimensional dynamical systems described
by the following equation:

˙xi = f (t, xi) + k(t) Xj∈Ni

(gij (xj) − xi) ,

(1)

where: (i) i = 1, . . . , N ; (ii) xi ∈ Rn is the state vector of
node i; (iii) f : R+ × Rn → Rn describes the intrinsic nodes’
dynamics; (iv) k(t) : R+ → R+ is the coupling strength; (v)
Ni is the set of neighbors to node i; (vi) the function gij (·)
is instead a coupling function that will be used in this paper
to obtain a speciﬁc synchronization pattern (as deﬁned in
Section III).

Note that, if in (1) we set gij(x) = x, ∀i, j = 1, . . . , N ,
then we obtain the well-known dynamics for a set of dif-
fusively coupled nodes. Such a dynamics can be written in
compact form as:

˙X = F (t, X) − k(t) (L ⊗ In) X,

(2)

1 , . . . , xT

Laplacian matrix, [22].

with: (i) X = (cid:2)xT
N(cid:3)T ∈ RnN ; (ii) F (t, X) =
(cid:2)f (t, x1)T , . . . , f (t, xN )T(cid:3)T ; and (iii) L being the N × N

In the rest of the paper we will refer to networks of
the form of (2) as auxiliary networks associated to (1).
Speciﬁcally, we will provide conditions for the onset of
synchronization patterns for network (1)which are based on
the onset of synchronization for network (2), deﬁned as
follows:

Deﬁnition 1: Let

˙s = f (t, s). We will say that (2)
achieves synchronization if limt→+∞ |xi(t) − s(t)| = 0,
∀i = 1, . . . , N .

C. Symmetries of ODEs

The symmetries of a system of ODEs are described in
terms of a group of transformations of the variables that
preserves the structure of the equation and its solutions
(see [23], [24] for a detailed discussion and proofs of the
material reported in this Section). In this paper, we will
ﬁrst (Section IV) consider symmetries of ODEs speciﬁed in
terms of compact Lie groups acting on Rn. Such groups can
be identiﬁed with a subgroup of O(n), i.e. ∀γ ∈ O(n), it
happens that γ−1 = γT . Then (Section V), we will consider
a special case where this assumption can be relaxed.

Let us consider a dynamical system of the form

˙x = f (t, x),

x ∈ Rn.

(3)

where f : R+ × Rn → Rn is a smooth vector ﬁeld. We will
use the following standard deﬁnitions [23].

Deﬁnition 2: The group element γ ∈ O(n) is a symmetry
of (3) if for every solution x(t) of (3), γx(t) is also a
solution.

Deﬁnition 3: Let Γ be a compact Lie group acting on Rn.
Then, f is Γ-equivariant if f (t, γx) = γf (t, x) for all γ ∈
Γ, x ∈ Rn.

Essentially, Γ-equivariance means that γ commutes with
f and it implies that γ is a symmetry of (3). In fact, let
y(t) = γx(t), we have that ˙y = γ ˙x = γf (t, x) = f (t, γx) =
f (t, y).

We now introduce the following Lemma which will be
used in the rest of this paper (the proof of this result can
be immediately obtained from [24] and is reported in the
Appendix).

Lemma 1: Assume that, for system (3), f (t, x) is Γ-
equivariant, with σi ∈ Γ, i = 1, . . . , r. Let D :=
diag{σ1, . . . , σr} and ˜f (t, y) = [f (t, x1)T , . . . , f (t, xr)T ]T ,
xi ∈ Rn, i = 1, . . . , r. Then, ∀y = [xT
r ]T ∈ Rnr, it
happens that D ˜f (t, y) = ˜f (t, Dy).

1 , . . . , xT

Remark 1: Essentially, Lemma 1 implies that whenever
a given function of interest f (t, x) is Γ-equivariant, i.e. f
commutes with some σi ∈ Γ, then the stack ˜f commutes
with the matrix D as deﬁned above.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

In this Section we formalize the control problem consid-
ered in this paper. Let GN := {1, . . . , N } be the set of
the network nodes and let G and G∗ be two subsets (or

groups) such that: G ∩ G∗ = {∅}, G ∪ G∗ = GN , with the
cardinality of G being equal to h and the cardinality of G∗
being N − h. Clearly, the two sets above generate a partition
on the network nodes. Throughout this paper, no hypotheses
will be made on the network partition, i.e. nodes can be
partitioned arbitrarily.

The goal of this paper is to address the so-called pattern
synchronization problem, which is formalized with the fol-
lowing deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4: Consider network (1) and let f be γ-
equivariant. We say that (1) achieves a γ-bipartite synchro-
nization pattern if

lim

t→+∞
lim

t→+∞

|xi(t) − s(t)| = 0, ∀i ∈ G;

|xi(t) − s∗(t)| = 0, ∀i ∈ G∗,

(4)

where s(t) = γ s∗(t).
That is, Deﬁnition 4 implies that the collective behavior
emerging from the network dynamics will show two groups
of nodes synchronized onto different orbits, with the syn-
chronous behaviors of the two groups correlated via the
symmetry γ. Note that in the case where nodes’ dynamics
are integrators, then the deﬁnition of synchronization above
simply becomes a deﬁnition for consensus. We will discuss
consensus in Section V, where we will also show that in this
special case the conditions of γ can be relaxed.

IV. BIPARTITE SYNCHRONIZATION

The following result provides a sufﬁcient condition for
network (1) to achieve a γ-bipartite synchronization pattern.

Theorem 2: A γ-bipartite synchronization pattern arises

for (1) if:

H1

H2

the intrinsic node dynamics, f , is γ-equivariant, i.e.
there exists some γ ∈ O(n), γT = γ−1, such that
γf (t, x) = f (t, γx);
gij is deﬁned as follows:

gij (xj) :=

xi, xj ∈ G or xi, xj ∈ G∗
xj ,
xi ∈ G and xj ∈ G∗
γ xj,
γT xj , xi ∈ G∗ and xj ∈ G

H3

Proof: Without

loss of generality,

the associated auxiliary network (2) synchronizes.
let us consider
the ﬁrst h nodes belonging to the subset G, that is G =
{1, . . . , h}, and the remaining nodes to G∗, that is G∗ =
{h + 1, . . . , N }. Therefore, by means of H2 the network
dynamics (1) becomes

for any i ∈ G∗. The above dynamics can be written as

˙xi = f (t, xi) − k(t)liixi +
hXj=1
˙xi = f (t, xi) − k(t)liixi +
hXj=1

if i ∈ G;

if i ∈ G∗,

where lij are the elements of the Laplacian matrix. Now, let
D be the nN ×nN block-diagonal matrix having on its main
block-diagonal

σi =(In

γ

if node i belongs to G
if node i belongs to G∗

(5)

That is, in compact form we have (recall that DT = D−1):

˙X = F (t, X) − k(t)DT (L ⊗ In)DX,

(6)

Let Z = DX. From (6) we have:

˙Z =D ˙X =

=DF (t, X) − k(t) DDT (L ⊗ In)DX =
=F (t, DX) − k(t) (L ⊗ In)DX =
=F (t, Z) − k(t) (L ⊗ In)Z,

(7)

where we used H1 and Lemma 1. Now, note that in the new
state variables, network dynamics becomes

˙Z = F (t, Z) − k(t)(L ⊗ In)Z,

(8)

that has the same form as the auxiliary network (2).

Since, by hypotheses H3, the auxiliary network synchro-
nizes, then also network (8) synchronizes. In turn, this means
that there exists some ˙s = f (t, s) such that, ∀i = 1, . . . , N :

lim

t→+∞

|zi(t) − s(t)| = 0,

∀i.

Since X = DT Z, we ﬁnally have that

lim

t→+∞

xi(t) =

=(In zi(t) = s(t),

γT zi(t) = γT s(t) = s∗(t),

if i ∈ G;
if i ∈ G∗.

(9)

The result is then proved.

Remarks

We now offer a number of remarks on Theorem 2.
Remark 2: Essentially, the spirit of Theorem 2 is that
of providing a condition for the onset of a γ-bipartite
synchronization pattern for a given network of interest, based
on a synchronization condition of the associated auxiliary
network. This approach is motivated by the fact that prov-
ing synchronization of a network is easier than proving
the onset of synchronization patterns. Moreover, note that,
with hypothesis H3, we assume that the auxiliary network
synchronizes and no explicit synchronization conditions are

for any i ∈ G, and

˙xi = f (t, xi)+k(t)
hXj=1
˙xi = f (t, xi)+k(t)

aij(xj − xi) +

aij(γT xj − xi) +

NXj=h+1

aij(γ xj − xi) ,
aij(xj − xi) ,
NXj=h+1

used to prove our result. This is motivated by the fact that,
in Literature, many results are currently available which can
be used to prove network synchronization under different
technical assumptions. Remarkable examples are the results
obtained via the use of Lyapunov functions, passivity theory,
contraction theory, monotone systems (see e.g. [25], [26],
[27], [28], [29], [30] and references therein) and, within the
Physics Community, the Master Stability Function, see e.g.
[31].

Remark 3: In the proof of Theorem 2, we use a trans-
formation matrix D which is a generalization of the one
used in [15]. In such the paper, as the Author was mainly
interested in studying the consensus dynamics over networks
with antagonistic interactions, only the set of gauge trans-
formations was considered. This set of transformations is
deﬁned as D = diag{σ1, . . . , σN }, but with σ’s being either
equal to 1 or −1.

Remark 4: Theorem 2 is also related in the spirit

to
the results of [12]. In such a paper, the authors studied
synchronization patterns by studying symmetries arising
from permutation matrices and then by assessing network
convergence. In principle, the class of systems considered is
this paper is somewhat wider than the ones considered in
[12].

Remark 5: Finally, note that Theorem 2 can be extended
to study γ-bipartite synchronization for discrete-time net-
works. Speciﬁcally, consider a discrete-time network of the
form

(gij (xj (t)) − xi(t)) ,

xi(t + 1) = f (t, xi(t)) + k(t) Xj∈Ni

(10)
where t belongs to the set of positive integers, i.e. t ∈ N+.
Then, under hypotheses H1 - H3, a γ-bipartite synchroniza-
tion pattern arises for network (10). The proof of this result
is straightforward and therefore it is omitted here for the sake
of brevity.

V. BIPARTITE CONSENSUS

We now turn our attention to the consensus problem,
where a network of agents needs to agree upon a given
quantity of interest. Consensus problems have been widely
investigated within the control theoretical community for its
application to e.g. sensor network problems, data fusion, see
e.g. [32] and [4]. Of particular interest within the Control
Theoretical Community is the so-called average consensus
problem, where all the nodes of network

˙xi = k(t) Xj∈Ni

(xj − xi) ,

(11)

PN

i = 1, . . . , N , xi ∈ R converge towards the quantity ¯x =

i=1 xi(0).
Often, in applications, it is desired that not all the network
nodes converge towards the same steady state behavior but
rather different group of nodes emerge, each converging
towards a value which is function of ¯x. In this Section, we
will therefore consider a more general version of the average
consensus problem, where two groups of network nodes

emerge: a ﬁrst group converging towards ¯x and a second
group converging towards some ¯x∗ which is a function of ¯x.
In proving our result, we will consider the following network
dynamics, which is a special case of (1), when f (t, xi) = 0
and xi ∈ R:

˙xi = k(t) Xj∈Ni

(gij (xj) − xi) ,

(12)

In what follows, we will say that network (11) is the auxiliary
network of (12).

We are now ready to give the following deﬁnition
Deﬁnition 5: We say that network (12) achieves γ-
bipartite consensus if there exist two groups of nodes, G
and G∗, forming a partition of GN such that:

lim

t→+∞
lim

t→+∞

|xi(t) − ¯x| = 0, ∀i ∈ G;

|xi(t) − ¯x∗| = 0, ∀i ∈ G∗,

(13)

where ¯x∗ = γ−1 ¯x.
In the following we give a sufﬁcient condition for γ-bipartite
pattern to arise in the consensus problem, similar to the one
presented in Section IV.

Theorem 3: Network (12) reaches a γ-bipartite consensus

if:

H1
H2

γ is invertible;
gij is deﬁned as as follows:

gij (xj) :=

xi, xj ∈ G or xi, xj ∈ G∗
xj ,
xi ∈ G and xj ∈ G∗
γ xj,
γ−1xj, xi ∈ G∗ and xj ∈ G

H3

the associated auxiliary network reaches consensus.
Before starting with the proof of the result, note that in
Theorem 3 we are only require γ to be invertible. This is
a weaker assumption than the one used to prove Theorem 2,
where we required γ to belong to O(n).

Proof: Following the same steps used to prove Theorem
2, by means of H1 and H2 network dynamics can be written
in compact form as

˙X = −k(t) D−1LDX,

(14)

where D is the n × n diagonal matrix having on its main
diagonal

σi =(1

γ

if node i belongs to G
if node i belongs to G∗

Let Z = DX. Network dynamics then becomes

˙Z = −k(t)LZ,

(15)

(16)

which has the same form as the auxiliary network (11). Since,
by hypotheses H3, the auxiliary network achieves consensus,
i=1 zi(0).

then all network nodes converge towards ¯z = PN

This, in turn, can be re-written as

lim

t→+∞

zi(t) =

1
N

1T
N Z(0),

∀i = 1, . . . , N.

(17)

Since X = D−1Z, we ﬁnally have that

lim

t→+∞

xi(t) =

=(¯x

γ−1 ¯x = ¯x∗

if i ∈ G
if i ∈ G∗

(18)

The result is then proved.

Remark 6: Theorem 3 provides a sufﬁcient condition for
a network to fulﬁll a state where a group of nodes agrees
onto ¯x while another group agrees onto a different value,
¯x∗. In our result we only need γ to be invertible and this
allows us to consider a wider class of symmetries than those
considered in [15]. In fact, the symmetry considered in such
a paper were γ ∈ O(n) : x → −x. With the result presented
above, we can instead cover a wider class of symmetries. An
example (used also in Section VII) is symmetries providing a
q x. With
re-scaled version of the state variables, i.e. γ : x → 1
this symmetry, two groups of nodes emerge, with one node
q ¯x.
converging towards ¯x and the other converging towards 1
Clearly, if q = −1, then we obtain the bipartite consensus
pattern of [15].

VI. A DESIGN METHODOLOGY

In Section IV and Section V we presented two results
providing sufﬁcient conditions for the onset of γ-bipartite
synchronization and consensus.

In this Section, we present a procedure which, based on
our results, can be used to design control strategies ensuring
that a network of interest attains a desired γ-bipartite pattern.
The key idea behind the methodology described below
is to design a local controller that accommodates, at the
node level,
the desired symmetry and a communication
protocol that adjusts the network structure for the desired
synchronization pattern. The resulting network dynamics will
then have the form

where i = 1, . . . , N and where u(xi) is the local controller
while gij is the protocol for the communication between
node j and node i. The control task in this case is to ensure
that the γ-bipartite pattern is achieved by the network. With
the following procedure we introduce a systematic method-
ology to design the local controller and the communication
protocols so that this control task is fulﬁlled.

Our procedure consists of the following steps:
1) Determine the desired symmetry, γ (recall that in the
case of synchronization, γ ∈ O(n), γ−1 = γT , while
in the case of consensus, γ has to only be invertible);
2) Check whether f (t, x)is γ-equivariant. If this condition
then set u(x) = 0 and go to step 3.

is veriﬁed,
Otherwise, design the local controller, so that

is γ-equivariant. Then, go to step 3;

bf (t, x) := f (t, x) + u(x)

3) Determine the network nodes that belong to G and

those that belong to G∗;

˙xi = f (t, xi) + u(xi) + k(t) Xj∈Ni

(gij (xj) − xi) ,

(19)

4) Design the communication protocols gij in accordance

to Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, i.e.:

gij (xj) :=

xi, xj ∈ G or xi, xj ∈ G∗;
xj,
xi ∈ G and xj ∈ G∗;
γ xj ,
γT xj, xi ∈ G∗ and xj ∈ G.

VII. APPLICATIONS

In this Section we demonstrate the effectiveness of our

results in an application.

A. Anti-synchronization of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators

We now address the problem of generating an anti-
synchronization pattern for a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo
(FN) (FN, see [33]) oscillators, described by the following
set of differential equations

3 v3

˙vi = c(cid:0)vi + wi − 1

˙wi = − 1

i + I(t)(cid:1) + kPj∈Ni (vj − vi),

c (vi − a + biw) + kPj∈Ni (wj − wi),

(20)
where: (i) vi and wi are the membrane potential and the
recovery variable for the i-th FN oscillator (i = 1, . . . , N );
(ii) I(t) is the smooth magnitude of an external stimulus
taken as input by all the FN oscillators in the network; (iii)
the FN oscillators are coupled on both the state variables.

By anti-synchronization pattern it is meant here the behav-
ior where two groups of nodes oscillate onto two opposite
synchronous trajectories. That is, in terms of the formalism
introduced in Deﬁnition 4, we have s(t) = −s∗(t) and

0

Now,

of the FN oscillator. It
is straightforward to check that
hypothesis H1 of Theorem 2 is fulﬁlled for the FNs. Indeed:

1

γf (x) =(cid:20)−c(cid:0)v + w − 1
=(cid:20)c(cid:0)−v − w + 1

3 v3 + I(cid:1)
3 v3 + I(cid:1)

c (−v − a − bw) (cid:21) = f (γx)

c (v − a + bw)

(cid:21) =

− 1

Consider now the network topology of Figure 1 (left panel)
and its partition illustrated in Figure 1 (right panel), therefore
G = {1, 3} and G∗ = {2, 4, 5}. Hence the nodes’ dynamics
(1) becomes

˙x1 = f (x1) + k (g12 (x2) + g13 (x3) − 2x1)
˙x2 = f (x2) + k (g21 (x1) − x2)
˙x3 = f (x3) + k (g31 (x1) + g34 (x4) + g35 (x5) − 3x3)
˙x4 = f (x4) + k (g43 (x3) − x4)
˙x5 = f (x5) + k (g53 (x3) − x5)

It

is well know from the literature that

(22)
the auxiliary
network (2) associated to the above dynamics synchronizes
if k is sufﬁciently large. Therefore, by choosing the coupling
gain k sufﬁciently high, hypothesis H3 of Theorem 2 will
be also fulﬁlled.

Fig. 2.
Top panel: time behavior of (20), with k = 1. Note that two
groups of anti-synchronized nodes arise. Bottom panel: transient behavior
of network nodes illustrating how the two groups arise. Initial conditions
are randomly taken from the standard distribution.

Finally, by setting

gij (xj) :=

xi, xj ∈ G or xi, xj ∈ G∗;
xj,
xi ∈ G and xj ∈ G∗;
γxj = −xj,
γT xj = −xj, xi ∈ G∗ and xj ∈ G,

(23)
we also fulﬁll H2 of Theorem 2. In turn, this implies that
anti-synchronization will be attained for the network of
Figure 1, where nodes 1 and 3 will converge onto the same
trajectory, s(t) while the group of nodes 2, 4 and 5 converge
onto −s(t).

Figure 2 clearly conﬁrms this theoretical prediction.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we presented new conditions for the onset of
synchronization and consensus patterns in complex networks.
Speciﬁcally, we showed that if network nodes exhibit some
symmetry and if the network topology is properly balanced
by the communication protocol,
then the symmetry can
be translated into a synchronization/consensus pattern. The
symmetries we considered for synchronization were those
belonging to the orthogonal group, while, for consensus, we
further relaxed this condition and only required the symmetry
to be invertible. Finally, we showed that our approach can
be turned into a design methodology and demonstrated the

effectiveness of our results. We believe that the results of
this paper are relevant to a number or applications ranging
from biochemical networks to social dynamics and Inter-
net of Things and, based on such results, future research
directions might include: (i) directed networks; (ii) synchro-
nization/consensus patterns characterized by more than two
coexisting groups; (iii) non-smooth dynamics.
