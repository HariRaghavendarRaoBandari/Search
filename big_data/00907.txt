DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

Abstract. We consider stochastic growth models to represent
population subject to catastrophes. We analyze the subject from
diﬀerent set ups considering or not spatial restrictions, whether dis-
persion is a good strategy to increase the population viability. We
ﬁnd out it strongly depends on the type of populational behaviour
when it faces a disaster, the spatial constraints of the environment
and the probability that each exposed individual survives when a
disaster stricks.

1. Introduction

Biological populations are often exposed to catastrophic events that
cause mass extinction: Epidemics, natural disasters, etc. When mild
versions of these disasters occur, survivors may develop strategies to
improve the odds of their species survival. Some populations adopt
dispersion as a strategy. Individuals of these populations disperse, try-
ing to make new colonies that may succeed settling down depending
on the new environment they encounter. Recently, Schinazi [7] and
Machado et al. [5] proposed stochastic models for this kind of popula-
tion dynamics. For these models they concluded that dispersion is a
good survival strategy.

Moreover, Brockwell et al. [2] and latter Artalejo et al. [1] consid-
ered a model for the growth of a population (a single colony) subject to
collapse. In their model, two types of behaviour when facing collapses

were analyzed separately, binomial behaviour and geometric behaviour.
After the collapse, the survivors remain together in the same colony
(there is no dispersion). They carried out an extensive analysis in-
cluding ﬁrst extinction time, number of individuals removed, survival
time of a tagged individual, and maximum population size reached be-
tween two consecutive extinctions. For a nice literature overview and
motivation see Kapodistria et al. [4].

Based on the model proposed by Artalejo et al. [1], and adapting
some ideas from Schinazi [7] and Machado et al. [5], we analyze growth
models of populations subject to disasters, where after the collapse
species adopt dispersion as a survival strategy. We show that dispersion
is not always a good strategy to avoid the population extinction. It
strongly depends on the type of populational behaviour when it faces a
disaster, the spatial constraints of the environment and the probability
that each exposed individual survives when a disaster stricks.

This paper is divided into four sections.

In Section 2 we deﬁne
and characterize three models for the growth of populations subject
to collapses.
In Section 3 we compare the three models introduced
in Section 2 and determine under what conditions the dispersion is a
good strategy for survival, due to space restrictions and behaviours
when facing collapses. Finally, in Section 4 we prove the results from
Section 2.

2. Growth models

First we decribe a model presented in Artalejo et al. [1]. This is a
model for a population which sticks together in one colony, whithout
dispersion. The colony gives birth to a new individual at rate λ > 0,
while collapses happen at rate µ. If at a collapse time the size of the
population is i, it is reduced to j with probability µij. The parameters
µij are determinated by how the population reacts when facing the
collapse. Next we describe two types of behaviours.

DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

• Binomial behaviour: Individuals react to disasters simultaneously
and independently of everything else. Each individual survives with
probability p < 1 (dies with probability q = 1 − p), meaning that

µB
ij =

piqi−j, 0 ≤ j ≤ i.

• Geometric behaviour: Individuals react to disaster sequencialy and
the efects of the disarter stop as soon as the ﬁrst individual survives, if
there are any. The probability of next individual to survive given that
everyone fails up to that point is p, which means that

2.1. Growth model without dispersion. In Artalejo et al. [1] the
authors consider the binomial and the geometric behaviour separately
as alternatives to the total catastrophe rule which instantaneously re-
moves the whole population whenever a catastrophic event occurs.

Here we consider a mixture of both behaviours, that is, with prob-
ability r the group behaves sequentially (geometric behaviour) and
with probability 1 − r the group behaves simultaneously (binomial be-
haviour). More precisely,

µij := rµG

ij + (1 − r)µB
ij.

We assume that the collapse rate µ equals 1. The size of the popula-
tion (number of individuals in the colony) at time t is a continuous time
Markov process {X(t) : t ≥ 0} whose inﬁnitesimal generator (qij)i,j≥0
is given by

j = i + 1, i ≥ 0,

otherwise.

We also assume X(0) = 1 and denote by C 1(p, r, λ) the process
described by {X(t) : t ≥ 0}. When r = 0 and r = 1, we obtain the
models considered in Artalejo et al. [1].

Theorem 2.1 (Artalejo et al. [1]). Let X(t) a process C 1(p, r, λ), with
λ > 0 and 0 < p < 1. Then, extinction (which means X(t) = 0 for
some t > 0) occurs with probability

(cid:111)

ρ1(r) =

min

λp , 1

, se r < 1
, se r = 1.

Moreover, if r < 1, or r = 1 and λp < 1 − p, the time it takes until
extinction has ﬁnite expectation.

Remark 2.2. The result of Theorem 2.1 has been shown by Artalejo
et al. [1] for the cases r = 0 and r = 1. From their result one can
see that survival is only possible when the behaviour of the group,
facing a catastrophic event, is purely geometric (r = 1). The reason
for that is quite clear: If r < 1 the binomial behaviours happen at rate
(1 − r) > 0 so even if one consider p = 1 when the population behaves
geometrically, the population will die out as proved in Artalejo et al. [1]
for the case r = 0.

2.2. Growth model with dispersion but no spatial restriction.
Consider a population of individuals divided into separate colonies.
Each colony begins with an individual. The number of individuals in
each colony increases independently according to a Poisson process of
rate λ > 0. Every time an exponential time occurs, the colony collapses
trough a binomial or a geometric behaviour and each of the collapse
survivors begins a new colony independently of everything else. We
denote this process by C 2(p, r, λ) and consider it starting from a single
colony with just one individual.

The following theorem establishes necessary and suﬃcient conditions

for survival in C 2(p, r, λ).

Theorem 2.3. The process C 2(p, r, λ) survives with positive probability
if and only if

p(λ + 1)2r

λp + 1

+ p(λ + 1)(1 − r) > 1.

(2.1)

DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

Theorem 2.3 shows that, contrary to what happens in C 1(p, r, λ), in
C 2(p, r, λ) the population is able to survive even when the binomial
behaviour is present (r < 1). See example 2.5. In particular, if r = 0
(pure binomial behaviour) the process survives with positive probabil-
ity whenever p(λ + 1) > 1.

Next result shows how to compute the probability of extinction,
which means, the probability that eventually the system becomes empty.

Theorem 2.4. Let ρ2(r) the probability of extinction in C 2(p, r, λ).
Then ρ2(r) is the smallest non-negative solution of

The smallest non-negative solution for the equation φ(s) = s, is given
by

ρ2(r) =

144r2 + 1176r + 49

Remark 2.6. For r = 0 (pure binomial behaviour) and r = 1 (pure
geometric behaviour) the smallest non-negative solution for (2.2) is:

ρ2(0) = min

e

ρ2(1) = min

Observe that ρ2(0) ≥ ρ2(1) where the strict inequality holds provided

(1 + λ + λ2)−1 < p < 1. Moreover,

Note that likewise as occurs in C 1(p, r, λ), the binomial behaviour is
a worst strategy than the geometric behaviour for population survival
in C 2(p, r, λ).

Remark 2.7. Observe that ρ1(r) ≥ ρ2(r) for r ∈ [0, 1]. In particular, if
r < 1 the inequality is strict provided (2.1). Moreover, ρ1(1) > ρ2(1) for
λ(1+λp) > q(λ+1). That means when there are no spatial restrictions,
dispersion is a good strategy for population survival. That coincides
with the results for the models presented and analised by Schinazi [7]
and Machado et al. [5].
2.3. Growth with dispersion and spatial restriction. Let Gm be
a graph such that every vertex has m neighbours, what is know as a
m−regular graph. Let us deﬁne a process with dispersion and spatial
restrictions on Gm, starting from a single colony placed at one vertex
of Gm, with just one individual. The number of individuals in a colony
growths following a Poisson process of rate λ > 0. To each colony we
associate an exponential time of mean 1 that deﬁnes when the colony
collapses. Each one of the individuals that survived the collapse (either
a binomial or a geometric behaviour) picks randomly a neighbor vertex
and tries to create a new colony at it. Among the survivors leaping to
the same vertex trying to create a new colony at it, only one succeeds
(disregarding the number of colonies already present at that vertex),
the others die. So in this case when a colony collapses, it is replaced
by 0,1, ... or m colonies. Finaly, every vertex can have any number of
independent colonies. We denote this process by C 3(p, r, λ, m),

The next result presents a necessary and suﬃcient condition for pop-

ulation survival in C 3(p, r, λ, m).

Theorem 2.8. The process C 3(p, r, λ, m) survives with positive proba-
bility if and only if

mp(1 + λ)2r

(m + λ)(λp + 1)

+

mp(1 + λ)(1 − r)

m + λp

> 1.

The following result shows that the extinction probability for the
process C 3(p, r, λ, m) can be computed as the root of a polynomial of
degree m.

Theorem 2.9. Let ρ3(r) be the probability of population extinction in
C 3(p, r, λ, m). Then ρ3(r) is the smallest non-negative soluction of

3. Dispersion as a survival strategy

Towards being able to evaluate dispersion as a survival strategy we

deﬁne

λi(p, r) := inf{λ : P[C i(p, r, λ) survives] > 0},
for i = 1, 2
and λ3(p, r, m) := inf{λ : P[C 3(p, r, λ, m) survives] > 0}.

Observe that for i = 1, 2, 3 and any m, when 0 < λi(p, r) < ∞ for
0 < p < 1, the graph of λi(p, r) splits the parametric space λ × p into
two regions. For those values of (λ, p) above the curve λi(p, r) there
is survival in C i(p, r, λ) with positive probability, and for those values
of (λ, p) below the curve λi(p, r) extictions occurs in C i(p, r, λ) with
probability 1.

Next we establish some properties of λ2(p, r) and λ3(p, r, m).

Proposition 3.1. Let 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 and 0 < p < 1. Then,

(i) 0 < λ2(p, r) < λ3(p, r, m + 1) < λ3(p, r, m) < ∞, for all m ≥ 2.

Besides λ3(p, r, 1) = ∞.

DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

(ii) lim

m→∞ λ3(p, r, m) = λ2(p, r)

For what follows 0 < p < 1. From Theorem 2.1 it follows that if

r < 1 then λ1(p, r) = ∞, and from Proposition 3.1 we obtain that

λ2(p, r) < λ3(p, r, m) < λ1(p, r),

for all m ≥ 2. Then, provided binomial behaviour is present (r < 1),
dispersion is a good strategy for population survival either with or
without spatial restrictions.

When binomial behaviour is not present (r = 1), which means, only
geometric behaviour is present, it is simple to compute λ1(p, 1), λ2(p, 1)
and λ3(p, 1, m). From Theorems 2.1, 2.3 and 2.8, we have that

λ1(p, 1) =

λ2(p, 1) =

λ3(p, 1, m) =

1 − p

,

2p(m − 1)

.

When r = 1 (pure geometric behaviour) λ2(p, 1) < λ1(p, 1). However,
dispersion is not always a better strategy for population survival, as
one can see at Figure 1. Observe that

λ3(p, 1, m) ≤ λ1(p, 1) ⇐⇒ p ≤ 1 − 1

m − 1

.

Therefore, under a pure geometric behaviour, dispersion is an advan-
tage or not for population survival depending on both m, the spatial
restrictions, and p, the probability of an individual, when exposed to
catastrophe, survive. See Figure 2.

4. Proofs

Theorem 2.1 is part of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 in Artalejo et
al. [1]. They work hard with the moment generating functions of the
ﬁrst excursion until 0 (the empty state) when the process (binomial and

geometric catastrophes) starts from 1 individual. Here we present an
alternative proof for r < 1 by the use of Foster’s theorem, enunciated
next. For a proof of Foster’s theorem see Fayolle et. al. [3, Theorem
2.2.3].

Theorem 4.1 (Foster’s theorem). Let (Wn)n≥0 be an irreducible and
aperiodic Markov chain on countable state space A = {αi, i ≥ 0}.
Then, (Wn)n≥0 is ergodic if and only if there exists a positive function
f (α), α ∈ A, a number  > 0 and a ﬁnite set A ⊂ A such that

E[f (Wn+1) − f (Wn) | Wn = αj] ≤ −, αj /∈ A,

E[f (Wn+1) | Wn = αi] ≤ ∞, αi ∈ A.

Next we present the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Let {Yn}n≥0 a discrete time Markov chain em-
bedded on C 1(p, r, λ), with transition probabilities given by

Pi,i+1 =

λ

,

λ + 1
ij + (1 − r)µB

Pi,j =

i ≥ 0,

0 ≤ j ≤ i.

,

Ergodicity of {Yn} implies that the time until extintion of C 1(p, r, λ)

has ﬁnite mean.

Observe that {Yn} is irreductible and aperiodic. We use Foster’s
theorem to show that {Yn}n≥0 is ergodic for 0 ≤ r < 1, 0 < p < 1 and
λ > 0. Consider the function f : N → R+ deﬁned by f (i) = i + 1,  > 0
and the set

A :=

i ∈ N :

λ − i(1 − r)q

1 + λ

− rq(1 − qi)

p(1 + λ)

.

For 0 ≤ r < 1, 0 < p < 1 and λ > 0, the set A is ﬁnite. Moreover

we have that

It follows from Foster’s theorem that Yn is ergodic and that concludes
(cid:3)
the proof.

Seeking the proof of the other results we deﬁne the following auxil-

iary process.

n )n≥0:

Auxiliary process (Z r,i
Consider C 2(p, r, λ) and C 3(p, r, λ, m). We deﬁne Z r,i
0 = 1 for i = 2, 3,
the number of colonies present at time 0 in each model. As soon as
it collapses, Z r,i
1 , a random number of colonies will be created, the
ﬁrst generation. Each one of these colonies will give birth (at diﬀerent
times) for a random number of new colonies, the second generation.
Let us deﬁnite this quantity by Z r,i
n−1 = 0
then Z r,i
n is the number
of colonies generated by the (n − 1) − th generation of colonies.

2 . In general, for n ≥ 1, if Z r,i

n = 0. By the other side, if Z r,i

n−1 ≥ 1 then Z r,i

From the fact that the numbers of descendants of diﬀerent colonies
n }n∈N

are independent and have the same distribution, we claim that {Z r,i
is a Galton-Watson process.

Remark 4.2. For i = 2, 3, observe that C i(p, r, λ) dies out if and
only if {Z r,i
n }n∈N dies out, which by its turn happens almost surely if
n }n∈N is

Proof. Consider C 3(p, r, λ, m) starting from one colony placed at some
vertex x ∈ Gm. Besides the quantity already deﬁned Z r,3
1 , consider also
Z the number of individuals that survived right after the collapse.

From the deﬁnition of C 3(p, r, λ, m) it follows that

P[Z = j] = rP[ZG = j] + (1 − r)P[ZB = j],

(4.3)

where ZB and ZG are the random variables deﬁned at (4.1) and (4.2),
respectively. By other side, for k ∈ {1, . . . , m} and j ≥ k, observe that

Finally, observe that P[Z r,3

1 = 0] = P[Z = 0] = q/(1 + λp). With
(4.4),(4.5) and (4.6) we obtain the probability generating function of

Z r,3

To compute E[Z r,3

1 ], consider enumerating each neighbour of the ini-
tial vertex x, from 1 to m. Next we describe Z r,3
i=1 Ii, where Ii
is 1 if and only if a new colony is created in the ﬁrst generation at the
vertex which is the i − th neighbour of x. Therefore,

P[Ii = 1] = mP[I1 = 1].

(4.9)

Finally, plugging (4.9) into (4.7) we obtain the desired result.

(cid:3)

Proofs of Theorems 2.3 and 2.8. From Remark 4.2 one can see that
C i(p, r, λ) survives if and only if E[Z r,i
n ] > 1. From Lemmas 4.3 and
(cid:3)
4.4 the result follows.

Proofs of Theorems 2.4 and 2.9. From Remark 4.2 we have that the
probabilities of extinction, ρ2(r) and ρ3(r), of C 2(p, r, λ) and C 3(p, r, λ, m),
are the smallest soluctions in [0, 1] of φr,i(s) = s for i = 2 and 3 respec-
(cid:3)
tively. The desired results follow from Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4.

DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

Proof of Proposition 3.1 (i). First we deﬁne the folowing functions

fm(λ)

:=

f (λ)

:=

mp(1 + λ)(1 − r)

,

m + λp

mp(1 + λ)2r

(m + λ)(λp + 1)
p(λ + 1)2r

+

λp + 1

+ p(λ + 1)(1 − r).

From Theorems 2.3 and 2.8 it follows that

λ2(p, r) = inf{λ : f (λ) > 1},
λ3(p, r, m) = inf{λ : fm(λ) > 1}.

Observe that fm and f are continuous functions on [0,∞), such that

fm(0) = f (0) = p < 1,

λ→∞ f (λ) = ∞ and lim

lim

λ→∞ fm(λ) = m.

Moreover, {fm}m≥1 is a strictly increasing sequence of strictly in-
m→∞ fm(λ) = f (λ). Similarly,

creasing functions on (0,∞) such that lim
f is a strictly increasing function.

Then, from the intermediate value theorem and the deﬁnition of
λ2(p, r) and λ3(p, r, m) we have that 0 < λ2(p, r) < ∞, 0 < λ3(p, r, m) <
∞ for m ≥ 2, and λ3(p, r, 1) = ∞. Besides,

f (λ) = 1 ⇐⇒ λ = λ2(p, r),
fm(λ) = 1 ⇐⇒ λ = λ3(p, r, m).

(4.10)

In order to show that λ3(p, r, m) > λ3(p, r, m + 1) for all m ≥ 2 let us
assume that λ3(p, r, m) ≤ λ3(p, r, m + 1) for some m ≥ 2 and proceed
by contradiction. Note that
1 = fm(λ3(p, r, m)) ≤ fm(λ3(p, r, m + 1)) < fm+1(λ3(p, r, m + 1)) = 1
which is cleary a contradiction. Analogously one can show that λ2(p, r) <
λ3(p, r, m) for all m ≥ 1.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 3.1 (ii). Let us restrict the domain of the func-
tions fm and f to [0, λ3(p, r, 2)]. Observe that fm and f are contin-
uous functions, that
m→∞ fm = f and that fm(λ) < fm+1(λ) for all
lim
λ ∈ [0, λ3(p, r, 2)]. Then, from Theorem 7.13 in Rudin [6] we have that
fm converges uniformely to f on [0, λ3(p, r, 2)].

DISPERSION AS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY

19

and the existence of θ := lim

From (i) it follows that λ3(p, r, m) ∈ [0, λ3(p, r, 2)] for all m ≥ 2
m→∞ λ3(p, r, m). Then, from the uniforme
m→∞ fm(λ3(p, r, m)) = 1,
convergence of fm to f , it follows that f (θ) = lim
(see Rudin [6, exercise 9, chapter 7]). Finaly the result follows from
(cid:3)
(4.10).
