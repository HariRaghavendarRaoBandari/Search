ABSTRACT

Context. The structure and heating of coronal loops are investigated since decades. Established scaling laws relate fundamental
quantities like the loop apex temperature, pressure, length, and the coronal heating.
Aims. We test such scaling laws against a large-scale 3D MHD model of the Solar corona, which became feasible with nowadays
high-performance computing.
Methods. We drive an active region simulation a with photospheric observations and found strong similarities to the observed coronal
loops in X-rays and EUV wavelength. A 3D reconstruction of stereoscopic observations showed that our model loops have a realistic
spatial structure. We compare scaling laws to our model data extracted along an ensemble of ﬁeld lines. Finally, we ﬁt a new scaling
law that represents well hot loops and also cooler structures, which was not possible before only based on observations.
Results. Our model data gives some support for scaling laws that were established for hot and EUV-emissive coronal loops. For the
RTV scaling law we ﬁnd an oﬀset to our model data, which can be explained by 1D considerations of a static loop with a constant
heat input and conduction. With a ﬁt to our model data we set up a new scaling law for the coronal heat input along magnetic ﬁeld
lines.
Conclusions. RTV-like scaling laws were ﬁtted to hot loops and therefore do not predict well the coronal heat input for cooler
structures that are hardly observable. The basic diﬀerences between 1D and self-consistent 3D modeling account for deviations
between our and earlier scaling laws. We also conclude that a heating mechanism by MHD-turbulent dissipation within a braided ﬂux
tube would heat the corona stronger than consistent with our model corona.

heating (alternating current, AC) may transport large amounts of
energy, but the exact dissipation mechanism that would repro-
duce realistic coronal structures remains unclear. On the other
hand, the ﬁeld-line braiding mechanism proposed by Parker
(1972) induces currents in the corona that are dissipated by
Ohmic (direct current, DC) heating. This is well described
in magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and observationally driven
computational models show an energy input together with a
dissipation mechanism which creates loop structures within the
corona that compare well to observations (Bourdin et al. 2013,
2014, 2015).

Later, Parker (1988) extended the ﬁeld-line braiding idea
towards the actual dissipation mechanism, where so-called
nanoﬂares are proposed. These are short-lived strong heating
events after fast and small-scale magnetic reconnection due to
the braiding of coronal ﬁeld lines. In reality, the advection of
magnetic ﬁeld lines in the photosphere is too slow to create a
substantial braid in the corona, because the Alfvén speed is large
enough to immediately propagate all disturbances in the mag-
netic ﬁeld into the corona, so that it might be preferable to con-
sider the process as a “quasi-static reconﬁguration and subse-
quent magnetic energy dissipation” (Bourdin et al. 2015). This
process can still yield a strong particle acceleration in the corona,
e.g. to non-thermal energies for electrons on the order of several
MeV, as demonstrated in (Threlfall et al. 2016).

The black box boundaries indicate the
central 117 × 117 Mm2 AR core area.

A diﬀerent approach to understand and describe the heating
of the corona is to statistically derive scaling laws from observed
coronal loops that relate global loop properties like their max-
imum temperature, their length, their density, or the magnetic
ﬁeld at their footpoints with the heating rate (Rosner et al. 1978;
van Ballegooijen et al. 2011), irrespective of how exactly this
heating is produced. Such scaling laws have also been used to
drive coronal models (e.g., Lionello et al. 2005) and to test the
observable consequences of diﬀerent scaling laws on the corona
(van Wettum et al. 2013). With observations of an active region
and a numerical experiment that matches observations (Bourdin
et al. 2013, 2014, 2015), we are now able to test theoretical scal-
ing laws (that relate global coronal loop parameters with their
heating) for consistency with our model corona. For that, we ex-
tract diﬀerent physical quantities along an ensemble of model
ﬁeld lines and check the scaling-law predictions. The tempera-
tures of the hot EUV-bright loops in our model compare well
to empirical scaling laws (Rosner et al. 1978). Loops that span
towards the periphery are usually less emissive, see rightmost
marked footpoint in Fig. 1, because they are rooted with at least
one footpoint in areas with a lower magnetic energy input to
the corona. Hence these loops are cooler, which speaks at ﬁrst
look against the results of existing empirical scaling laws, like
the RTV of Rosner et al. (1978). For the coronal heating and the
resulting temperature we ﬁt a new scaling law and compare this
with other MHD model results (Rappazzo et al. 2008; van Balle-
gooijen et al. 2011).

2. Coronal model and ﬁeld-line ensemble
The model is driven only from the lower boundary with an ob-
served line-of-sight magnetogram, see Fig. 2. The magnetic en-
ergy input in form of Poynting ﬂux is through a photospheric
motion driver that contains the large-scale motions of the mag-
netic patches as deduced from the observed timeseries of mag-

netograms together with a photospheric motion driver, as we
describe in more detail in Bourdin et al. (2013). As initial con-
dition we use a potential ﬁeld extrapolation but propagate then
the magnetic ﬁeld fully self-consistently by the MHD equations.
We start the simulation smoothly to avoid switch-on eﬀects, see
Bourdin (2014), and to compensate for a lack of coronal heating
until the magnetic disturbances from the photosphere have prop-
agated with the Alfvén speed into the corona, as we describe in
Bourdin et al. (2014). For the simulation we use the Pencil Code
(Brandenburg & Dobler 2002)1.

We select for our analysis the same set of ﬁeld lines as in our
previous publication (Bourdin et al. 2015). These were selected
from seed points randomly distributed in a volume over the AR
core. An additional set of seed points was distributed on a verti-
cal plane that cuts through most of the closed-ﬁeld lines between
the two main polarities along Solar-Y direction. The distribution
of seed points is weighted by the magnetic ﬂux density. We select
ﬁeld lines that a) are closed and do not connect to the upper box
boundary, b) have a length of 18 Mm to 150 Mm, c) reach a min-
imum temperature of at least 75’000 K before reaching a height
of 18 Mm. Also we make sure that the ﬁeld lines crossing the
EUV-intensity maximum of the most prominent loops (SL 1-3
and CL 1+2, see Bourdin et al. 2013) are included in this ensem-
ble of about 67’000 ﬁeld lines, as well as some 200 ﬁeld lines
neighboring these loops.

3. Scaling laws for coronal loop properties
We have good indications for relations of the coronal Ohmic
heating to the ﬁeld-line length, the footpoint magnetic ﬂux den-
sity, and hence also the vertical net Poynting ﬂux, (Bourdin et al.
2015). We now want to compare our model ﬁeld lines with theo-
retical scaling laws relating plasma parameters (like the density,
the temperature, or the pressure) of the ﬁeld line to the energy

input and ﬁeld-line length. Such scaling laws are partly also de-
rived from observations (Rosner et al. 1978). Rosner et al. (1978)
were the ﬁrst to derive the RTV scaling laws (named after the au-
thors)

H = cH · p7/6L−5/6,

for the temperature T and the heating rate H along a hot coronal
loop. Here, the heating rate H(s) is assumed to be constant along
a loop and is irrespective of the actual mechanism that delivers
the energy.

The RTV equations can be rewritten as

4. Scaling laws in 3D model
4.1. Heating and loop length
First, we plot in Fig. 3 the ﬁeld-line length versus the average
of the volumetric Ohmic heating, both quantities represent only
the coronal part, as deﬁned in the Sect. 2. We ﬁnd a broad dis-
tribution, where ﬁeld lines with footpoint ﬂux densities of 300-
400 G appear practically everywhere, but there is a concentra-
tion in the upper center around 75-100 Mm ﬁeld line length that
shows signiﬁcantly high heating rates. As we go to shorter ﬁeld
lines, we see that the footpoint ﬂux density decreases to values
around 200 G for ﬁeld-line lengths of 20 Mm. At the same time
the Ohmic heating rises, following the trend of the overplotted
RTV scaling law (gray dashed line) that we get from sample pa-
rameters of a hot coronal loop with a maximum temperature of
Tmax = 1.6 MK. The three hottest coronal loops (SL 1+2 and
CL 1) follow well this RTV scaling law. The same relation holds
also between both warm loops (SL 3 and CL 2).

As we already demonstrated (see Fig. 10 in Bourdin et al.
2015), ﬁeld lines with footpoint ﬂux densities below a critical
limit of 200 G do not show particularly high Ohmic heating.
Nonetheless, they can span over short and long distances into
the corona. For ﬁeld lines longer than 150 Mm with ﬂux densi-
ties of about 150 G (turquoise), we still ﬁnd some that reach to-
wards the scaled properties of much shorter warm coronal ﬁeld

lines (c.f. Fig. 3). If that scenario is persistent, more warm loops
of lengths above 150 Mm will form in our model that will span
high up into the corona. Besides that, there is also a large popula-
tion of ﬁeld lines with low footpoint ﬂux densities that are simply
not suﬃciently heated and that are currently cooling down. This
is consistent with coronal observations, where only a minority

of coronal ﬁeld lines is actually seen as loops that are bright in
EUV or X-ray emission lines, and a majority of ﬁeld lines is not.
Therefore our ﬁnding, that H ∼ L−2 provides an upper limit for
the heat input in our model, is consistent with the general trend
from the RTV scaling law. Still, we ﬁnd a quite large scatter of
the RTV predictions for ﬁeld lines along which the heating is
less strong and that consequently are loaded with cooler plasma.

4.2. Loop temperature
The RTV scaling law itself can also be tested against the model
directly. We do this by comparing the maximum temperatures of
the coronal loop, once taken directly from the model, and once
calculated from the model properties, i.e. the energy input into
a structure and its ﬁeld-line length, using the RTV scaling law
Eqn. 7. Because RTV assumes a constant heating rate, we use
here the average heating rate < H >= FH/L for comparison. In
Fig. 4 we present the distribution of the model values in relation
to the RTV scaling law, where the black solid line indicates the
equality of both quantities.

In hydrostatic equilibrium and with a prescribed heating, the
loop-top temperature Tmax can be derived for a 1D loop model
in thermal equilibrium and with a static energy balance includ-
ing radiative losses and heat conduction. As a result, the RTV
heating (Eqn. 2) is derived with a constant correction factor 3.5
(Priest 1982). This correction factor corresponds to a constant
shift in logarithmic coordinates (dashed line in Fig. 4). The slope
of both lines reﬂects an exponent of 2/7.

We ﬁnd a good match in the scaling for the hot end of the
distribution, starting with temperatures of 0.5 MK and up to our
hottest model loops (symbols) at around 1.7 MK, see Fig. 4. Also
here, a large population of ﬁeld lines is cooler than predicted,
which is not a contradiction, because these cool ﬁeld lines are
not covered by the RTV scaling laws that were laid out to match
only hot (EUV-emissive) loops.

5. Parameterization of Ohmic heating
5.1. van Ballegooijen scaling law
We want to investigate further possible scaling laws for the
Ohmic heating rate. For instance, van Ballegooijen et al. (2011)
have conducted box model simulations of individual coronal
loop structures (ﬂux tubes) using a stratiﬁed atmosphere. In these
models, driving motions are applied on the two opposite ends
of the cuboid box, which encompasses the non-curved straight
loop. Alfvén waves and MHD turbulences heat the coronal part
of the loop. From a parameter study, the following relation to
the loop length, the magnetic ﬂux density at the photospheric
boundary, and the driving motions is inferred:

where τ0 = 60 − 200 s is the correlation time of the driving mo-
tions. The average (root-mean-squared) velocity of the driving
motions in our model is vRMS = 1.242 km/s. We use the ex-
ponents for the relation between coronal heating and magnetic
ﬁeld strength (β), the driving velocity relation (δ), and the ﬁeld-
line length relation (γ) as given in van Ballegooijen et al. (2011),
see also Table 1. In their scaling law the driving motions vRMS
were of larger amplitude (1.48 km/s) and hence we expect a

25 % lower heating rate prediction due to 16 % weaker driving
motions in our model.

In Fig. 5 we compare the parameters of our model ﬁeld lines
with the prediction based on the van Ballegooijen et al. (2011)
scaling law for the coronal heating. Basically, we ﬁnd that prac-
tically all coronal ﬁeld lines have a signiﬁcantly lower heating
rate than predicted, which is not explicable by our weaker driv-
ing motions. The short and hot AR core loops (SL 1+2) have
the highest prediction for the coronal heating, while the longer
loops (CL 1+2) are heated about ten times less. These strongest
heated ﬁeld lines form a population (from CL 1 to SL 1, above
3 · 10−5 W/m3) that indicates a slope roughly twice as steep as
the van Ballegooijen et al. (2011) scaling law would predict.

The length relation in Eqn. 10 seems to be partly responsible
for the distribution of the data points within this most heated
population. As one would expect from the inverse dependency
on L, the shorter ﬁeld lines (blue) have a higher predicted coronal
heating than the longer ﬁeld lines (turquoise). This trend even
continues to the longest coronal ﬁeld lines (yellow and red) that
are located left below the long hot coronal loop CL 1.
For a coronal Ohmic heating below 10−5 W/m3 we ﬁnd a
strong variation of the ﬁeld-line parameters that doesn’t allow
conclusions on the slope of possible scaling laws. A dependency
on the ﬁeld-line length can still be seen, because the long (red)
and the short (blue) ﬁeld lines are roughly ordered from the left
to the right. Overall, the match of the prediction to our model
parameters is not good.

5.2. Rappazzo scaling law

Based on MHD turbulence models that resemble the ﬁeld-line
braiding mechanism, Rappazzo et al. (2008) have found a dif-
ferent dependency of the Ohmic heating on the magnetic ﬂux
density and the loop length than van Ballegooijen et al. (2011).

In van Wettum et al. (2013) this form prescribes one of several
tested heating parametrizations for a coronal MHD model.

In contrast to the van Ballegooijen et al. (2011) scaling law,
Rappazzo et al. (2008) use the Alfvén crossing time τA as time
scale and not the correlation time scale τ0 of the driving motions.
Because the value range of τA reaches to values up to 2000 s,
we need to adapt the τ term of the scaling law so that it repre-
sents well not only the value range between 60–200 s (van Bal-
legooijen et al. 2011), but also has a continuous eﬀect on larger
τ values. Loops have in our case a length of about 75 Mm. E.g.,
that implies τA = 750 s for average Alfvén velocities of about
100 km/s.

In Fig. 6 we see that the Rappazzo et al. (2008) exponents
better describe our model data, as compared to the van Bal-
legooijen et al. (2011) scaling law. The slope of the strongly
heated ﬁeld-lines population (extending towards the upper right
in Fig. 6) ﬁts better to the equality line (black). Also the dis-
crepancy between the prediction and the model values is much
smaller than it is in Fig. 5. This shows that the relation between
the Ohmic heating to the magnetic ﬁeld strength is weaker, and
the relation to the ﬁeld-line length is stronger in our model than
predicted by the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law.

For this we use a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization to
adjust the exponents β, δ, and γ in Eqn. 12. The dependency on
the mean particle number density we keep ﬁxed, because there
is no correlation to ﬁt to in our model data, see Fig. 6 in Bourdin
et al. (2014). We use the same exponents as in Sect. 5.2, except
that in our model the Alfvén crossing time τA through a loop is
of the order of 40 minutes.
We exclude the data points with a heating rate lower than
the threshold value of 5 · 10−6 W/m3, because there is practi-
cally no structure in this data and including it would result in a
false impression of accuracy by underestimated error intervals of
the ﬁtted exponents. For the ﬁtting, we estimate the error of the
model data to a constant value of 25 % of the maximum heating
rate. This reﬂects the large scatter we see in the data and actually
puts less weight to the weakly heated ﬁeld lines.

We ﬁxed the parameter τA during the optimization, because
it acts on the same degree of freedom (DOF) as δ does, namely
shifting the whole data towards higher or lower heating rates.
Freeing two parameters for one DOF would result in an under-
estimated χ and overestimated errors for the ﬁtted parameters.
We keep ω = 0.125, which follows from setting α = 2 in the
Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law.

From the LM optimization of the 20’000 remaining ﬁeld
lines, that surmount the heating rate threshold, we get the ex-
ponents with a reduced χ of 2.45 per DOF, see Table 1.

A χ larger than 1 indicates missing degrees of freedom for
the ﬁt or alternatively a too small error estimate, but our error es-
timate is already quite large. A reduced χ on the order of 2, as we
ﬁnd it here, would therefore indicate that there should be roughly
double as much DOFs as we give to the ﬁtting procedure. In this
case, we can safely state that there are more relations to consider
in order to predict the coronal Ohmic heating than just the ﬁeld-
line length, the density, and the magnetic ﬁeld strength. E.g., it
could make a diﬀerence if the used footpoint locations of a ﬁeld
line are relatively low or higher up in the atmosphere, because
this already changes the net Poynting ﬂux into the ﬁeld line in
average (see Fig. 2 in Bourdin et al. 2015). Also the highly vary-
ing net vertical Poynting ﬂux at the ﬁeld-line footpoints has an
inﬂuence irrespective of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

In Fig. 7 we present our scaling law’s prediction using the
exponents as ﬁtted to the data. We ﬁnd that the population of the
strongest heated ﬁeld lines follows very well the equality line be-
tween scaling law and our model heating rate. As the prediction
is valid only for the coronal loops with a high dissipation of the
energy input, and we know that most of the coronal ﬁeld lines
are not heated strong enough to evolve into a EUV-bright loop,
we also see here many ﬁeld lines with a heating rate signiﬁcantly
lower than predicted (below the equality line).

In Table 1 we give the exponents of the van Ballegooi-
jen et al. (2011) and the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling laws
(Eqns. 10 and 11) in comparison to our modiﬁed scaling law
(Eqn. 12) together with the 1-σ uncertainty of the ﬁt as estimated
by the LM method.

The dependency of the Ohmic heating from the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and ﬁeld-line length is stronger in our model data
than predicted by van Ballegooijen et al. (2011). This reﬂects,
amongst others, the inﬂuence of geometrical eﬀects due to the
curvature of the ﬁeld in our model. In contrast to this work,
the original setup of van Ballegooijen et al. (2011) used coro-
nal loops that are straight structures and hence depend less on
the ﬁeld-line length L. A curvature in the magnetic ﬁeld might
amplify the induced coronal currents as compared to a straight
loop, because the Ohmic heating is proportional to the currents
as HOhm ∼ j2 that have the proportionality j ∼ ∇ × B, where the
curvature of the magnetic ﬁeld becomes relevant.
For the magnetic ﬁeld strength we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly weaker
dependency β and the driving motions have in our case a stronger
impact on the heating than predicted by the Rappazzo et al.
(2008) scaling law. Only the ﬁt of the exponent γ, representing
the dependency on the ﬁeld-line length, is still consistent within
its error as compared to the exponents given in the work of Rap-
pazzo et al. (2008).

6. Conclusions
The diﬀerences between the prediction of the van Ballegooijen
et al. (2011) scaling law in comparison to our model can be ex-

plained by a combination of: a) diﬀerent Alfvén travel times into
the corona, b) diﬀerent dissipation scales, c) the curvature of
magnetic ﬁeld in our model setup, and d) a diﬀerent magnetic
energy transport and dissipation mechanism that is in our case
more comparable to slow magnetic diﬀusion instead of Alfvén
waves or MHD turbulence.

Even though Rappazzo et al. (2008) use a very similar coro-
nal heating mechanism to the one we implemented in our model
(ﬁeld-line braiding), we still ﬁnd signiﬁcantly lower heating
rates in our model than the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law
would predict. One possible reason for this diﬀerence could be
found in the magnetic Reynolds number. In their comparison
of simulations with diﬀerent magnetic Reynolds numbers Rap-
pazzo et al. (2008) have shown that a saturation of the heating
rates occurs at Reynolds numbers of about 800 and above. Here
our model falls short. Because we consider a whole active re-
gion and each individual coronal loop covers only a fraction of
the volume, the magnetic Reynolds number (when considering
the length scale of a coronal loop in our model) is signiﬁcantly
lower. While our whole computational domain covers more grid
points (1024× 1024× 256) than the Rappazzo et al. (2008) mod-
els (up to 512 × 512 × 200), in their model they describe only
a single (straightened out) loop structure, and consequently can
reach signiﬁcantly higher Reynolds numbers.

The coronal heating scaling law we ﬁt to our model data
indicates a dependency on the magnetic ﬁeld that lies between
the exponents given by Rappazzo et al. (2008) and van Balle-
gooijen et al. (2011). Also we ﬁnd that the homogeneous atmo-
spheric background in the MHD-turbulence setup of Rappazzo
et al. (2008) may be problematic when estimating the coronal
magnetic energy input or braiding of ﬁeld lines, because the
Alfvén crossing time τ, which determines their scaling law ex-
ponents, varies strongly within our stratiﬁed atmosphere.

In a recent study van Ballegooijen et al. (2014) speculate that
the quasi-static behavior of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, as found
in models like ours, is due to the limited spatial resolution of the
photospheric magnetic driving. They suggest that in the case of
increased resolution the heating might be wave-dominated. Cer-
tainly, with increasing resolution also AC heating will be present,
but this does not automatically imply that the DC heating be-
comes less eﬃcient. In the contrary, models that employ reduced
MHD (allowing for a higher spatial resolution) show that also
for high spatial resolution MHD turbulence will lead to a DC-
type heating by the build-up of current sheets (e.g., Rappazzo
et al. 2008). This is backed by the argument that in the coro-
nal part of the atmosphere a ﬁeld line will adapt quickly to any
wave excitation from below, because coronal Alfvén speeds are
at least one order of magnitude faster than within the lower at-
mosphere (c.f. Fig. A.1 and Table A.1). More realistic full MHD
simulations with increased resolution will have to show the rel-
ative merits of AC and DC heating based on the photospheric
driving.

The temperature scaling laws we tested against our model
ﬁeld lines (Rosner et al. 1978; Serio et al. 1981) indicate only
general trends for the most heated ﬁeld lines and EUV-emissive
loops. This puts all attempts to set up scaling laws of the coro-
nal heating into their context, namely that these laws are de-
duced from and are applicable only to a small subset of coronal
ﬁeld lines, namely the ones that are bright in EUV or X-rays.
Non-emissive and weakly heated ﬁeld lines are often not consis-
tent with scaling laws intended for 1D-loop structures. Some of
their plasma parameters need to be determined diﬀerently, e.g.
through self-consistent 3D MHD simulations.

Ph.-A. Bourdin, S. Bingert, H. Peter: Scaling laws of coronal loops compared to an AR model

It is an interesting question, if such observationally moti-
vated scaling laws would beneﬁt from new and much more pre-
cise observations of hot coronal loops. We ﬁnd that the ﬁeld lines
hosting the hottest plasma in our model roughly follow the old
RTV scaling law. But with observations one would always miss
the cooler coronal ﬁeld lines, because they are not EUV-bright.
On the other hand, self-consistent 3D MHD simulations provide
good data to match all kinds of ﬁeld lines, as shown in Sect. 5.3.
Nonetheless, for EUV-emissive coronal loops and relatively
strong heated ﬁeld lines, we are able to ﬁt a scaling law to our
3D MHD model data that is consistent with coronal observations
(see Bourdin et al. 2013, 2014). This scaling law includes pa-
rameters such as the loop length, the magnetic ﬂux at the foot-
points, the photospheric driving motions, the loop density, and
the Alfvén crossing time in order to roughly predict a coronal
Ohmic heat input.

spectral indices

In Sect. 5.3 we ﬁt the exponents in Eqn. 12 as independent vari-
ables to compare them with other scaling laws. Strictly speaking,
according to the scaling laws derived by Rappazzo et al. (2008)
the parameters β, δ, γ and ω are not independent. Instead, their
values are set by one single parameter z deﬁned as:

exponents for each individual ﬁeld line, depending on τ. In the
following we check, how diﬀerent these exponents really are for
our model data and if that inﬂuences our ﬁt.

Because of the density stratiﬁcation in our model we have a
much larger range of Alfvén speeds than Rappazzo et al. (2008).
Thus we extrapolate the parameter α based on a power law be-
tween α and cA in the range of 50 km/s to 2000 km/s given by
Rappazzo et al. (2008) and list the values in Table A.1.

Despite the wide range of Alfvén crossing times (cA cov-
ers over 4 orders of magnitude in Table A.1) the values of z are
within a range from only about 0.5 to 1.0. Thus using the mean
of z = 0.75 (corresponding to cA = 310 km/s or α = 2) seems to
be a good choice, which was also used in Lionello et al. (2013)
and van Wettum et al. (2013). Now the exponents in Eqn. 11 are
given by:
β = 1 + z
γ = −1 − z
δ = 2 − z
ω = (1 − z)/2

The (double-logarithmic) slope of the magnetic energy spec-
trum is set by a turbulent energy conversion cascade along a ﬁeld
line. This slope is the spectral index s that can be derived as (see
Eqn. 53 in Rappazzo et al. 2008):

z = (α + 1)/(α + 2)

(A.1)

s = (3α + 5)/(α + 3)

(A.2)

where α depends only on the Alfvén crossing time τ along each
ﬁeld line, see Table A.1. We expect variations of the scaling law

In Fig. A.1 we show the distribution of the spectral indices as de-
rived from our model ﬁeld lines. We ﬁnd that the spectral index

Fig. A.2. Same as Fig. 6, but with a ﬁeld-line individual τ (and hence
z) parameter. The color-coding represents the spectral index s of the
coronal part of each ﬁeld line, which determines here the exponents of
the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law.

s varies only little for our model ﬁeld lines, which is connected
to the parameter α by Eqn. A.2. Therefore, it is justiﬁed to set
α globally constant for all ﬁeld lines in Sect. 5.2, even though
our choice of α = 2 was a bit too high or too low, depending on
how one likes to interprete the strongly varying Alfvén speed cA
wihtin a stratiﬁed atmosphere, see the spectral index of full ﬁeld
lines versus their coronal part in Fig. A.1.

When we do a ﬁeld-line individual computation of the Rap-
pazzo et al. (2008) scaling law with the actual τ along each ﬁeld
line, we ﬁnd in Fig. A.2 that the scatter is increased, as compared
to Fig. 6. This is a result of the varying spectral index, because
the lower s values (blue, on the left) lead to a lower heating rate
prediction, while the higher s values (red, on the right) predicts
an even stronger heating rate. The over-estimation of the heat-
ing rate for ﬁeld lines similar to the EUV-bright coronal loops
(symbols) increases by roughly one order of magnitude. Still,
the general shape of the distribution of data points remains sim-
ilar as in Fig. 6, because the spectral index s is rather constant
within the corona for a large part of our model data, see also the
histogram in Fig. A.1.

In principle, lower cA values (that imply lower α and higher
τ) below the corona should not be very relevant for the heating
rate predicted for the coronal part along the ﬁeld lines. Nonethe-
less, we also checked that lower average α values along the full
ﬁeld lines we ﬁnd in our model data still result in a too strong
heating rate prediction by the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law,
very similar to Fig. 6, but with slightly increased scatter, for sim-
ilar reasons as described above for Fig. A.2. This means that our
choice of the α parameter was rather on the conservative side
and that a ﬁeld-line individual computation does not improve
the match between the Rappazzo et al. (2008) scaling law and
our model corona.
