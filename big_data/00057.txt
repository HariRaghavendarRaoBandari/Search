LOW-MASS ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI WITH RAPID X-RAY VARIABILITY

LUIS C. HO1,2 AND MINJIN KIM3,4

To appear in The Astrophysical Journal.

ABSTRACT

We present a detailed study of the optical spectroscopic properties of 12 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with
candidate low-mass black holes (BHs) selected by Kamizasa et al.
through rapid X-ray variability. The high-
quality, echellette Magellan spectra reveal broad Hα emission in all the sources, allowing us to estimate robust
viral BH masses and Eddington ratios for this unique sample. We conﬁrm that the sample contains low-mass BHs
accreting at high rates: the median MBH = 1.2 × 106 M⊙ and median Lbol/LEdd = 0.44. The sample follows the
MBH - σ∗ relation, within the considerable scatter typical of pseudobulges, the probable hosts of these low-mass
AGNs. Various lines of evidence suggest that ongoing star formation is prevalent in these systems. We propose
a new strategy to estimate star formation rates in AGNs hosted by low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies, based on
modiﬁcation of an existing method using the strength of [O II] λ3727, [O III] λ5007, and X-rays.

1. INTRODUCTION

Central black holes (BHs) constitute an integral component
of the nuclear regions of galaxies. Much progress has been
made in the detection and characterization of the statistical
properties of supermassive BHs in nearby galaxies, over the
mass range MBH ≈ 106 - 1010 M⊙ (e.g., Gültekin et al. 2009;
McConnell & Ma 2013; Kormendy & Ho 2013). During the
last 10 years, there has also been a number of successful at-
tempts to identify the rarer population of lower mass central
BHs, with MBH ∼< 106 M⊙, in bands ranging from the optical
(e.g., Greene & Ho 2004, 2007c; Barth et al. 2008; Seth et
al. 2010; Dong et al. 2012b; Reines et al. 2013; Moran et
al. 2014; Baldassare et al. 2015), to the radio (Reines et al.
2011, 2014), and the mid-infrared (Satyapal et al. 2008, 2009,
2014; Goulding & Alexander 2009). X-ray images, particu-
larly at high angular resolution, can effectively identify candi-
date active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as compact nuclear cores in
low-mass, late-type—even dwarf—galaxies (Desroches & Ho
2009; Zhang et al. 2009; Reines et al. 2011, 2014; Araya Salvo
et al. 2012; Schramm et al. 2013; Lemons et al. 2015).

Exploiting the fact that the amplitude of X-ray variabil-
ity in AGNs scales inversely with BH mass (e.g., Lu & Yu
2001; Papadakis 2004; McHardy et al. 2006), Kamizasa et
al. (2012) used the Second XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source
Catalogue (Watson et al. 2009) to select a sample of 16 AGNs
with candidate low-mass BHs, based on the presence of rapid
variability in their X-ray light curve. For the 15 sources for
which they could compute the “normalized excess variance”
in the 0.5–10 keV band, they estimate that their sample con-
tains MBH ≈ (1.1 - 6.6) × 106 M⊙. The subset with available
redshift estimates has an inferred median Eddington ratio of
λE ≡ Lbol/LEdd = 0.24, where Lbol is the bolometric luminos-
ity and LEdd is the Eddington luminosity. The remaining ob-
ject, 2XMM J123103.2+110648, has an exceptionally promi-
nent soft X-ray excess, which Terashima et al. (2012) model
with a multicolor disk blackbody with an inner disk tempera-

ture of kT = 0.16- 0.21 keV. In a follow-up optical study, Ho et
al. (2012) conﬁrm the AGN nature of the source but ﬁnd that
it emits only narrow emission lines, an unexpected result given
the lack of signiﬁcant intrinsic X-ray absorption and the high
Eddington ratio (λE ∼> 0.5) derived from its estimated BH mass
of ∼ 105 M⊙.

The majority of Kamizasa et al.’s sample has no previous
optical spectroscopic data, not even basic information such as
spectroscopic redshifts, making it impossible to derive many
fundamental parameters for this unique sample. Moreover, in
light of the intriguing properties of 2XMM J123103.2+110648,
it would be of interest to investigate the optical spectral proper-
ties of these objects more systematically. This paper reports de-
tailed high-resolution , high–signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optical
spectra for 12 of the 15 sources from the sample of Kamizasa et
al. (2012) with BH masses previously estimated through X-ray
variability. As the sample was initially designed to select low-
mass objects, we anticipate the emission lines, both broad and
narrow, to have small velocity widths; moderately high disper-
sion would be required to measure useful kinematics.

2. OBSERVATIONS, DATA REDUCTION, AND SPECTRAL FITS
The observations, summarized in Table 1, were obtained with
the Magellan 6.5m Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observa-
tory, during the course of two observing runs in 2013, using
the Magellan Echellette (MagE) spectrograph (Marshall et al.
2008). The spectra cover ∼3100 Å to 1 µm in 15 spectral
orders at a resolving power for a 1′′ slit, as determined from
the sky emission lines, of λ/∆λ = 4627, which corresponds to
an instrumental velocity dispersion of σi = 27.6 km s- 1. The
brightnesses of the sources range from g ≈ 18 to 21 mag. We
observed featureless standard stars for ﬂux calibration and tel-
luric correction, as well as late-type stellar templates for ve-
locity dispersion measurement. The observing conditions were
mostly photometric, but the observations were occasionally car-
ried out under thin cirrus. The seeing varied from 0.′′6 to 1.′′2.

mage_reduce developed and kindly provided by George
Becker. We performed ﬂat-ﬁelding correction using twilight
ﬂats and contemporaneous dome ﬂats taken just after each sci-
ence exposure. Wavelength calibration was done using ThAr
arc spectra. After extracting 1-D spectra, we apply ﬂux calibra-
tion and telluric correction. We correct for Galactic extinction
using the extinction values of Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011) and
the reddening curve of Cardelli et al. (1989).

Figure 1 shows the ﬁnal spectra for the sample. Strong
emission lines, and in some cases a featureless continuum, are
present in all the sources, superposed on a weak stellar contin-
uum characteristic of intermediate-age stars. The strong emis-
sion lines, particularly [O III] λ5007, allow us to determine—

accurately and for the ﬁrst time in most cases—the redshifts
of the sample (Table 1). We decompose the spectra into host
galaxy starlight, a featureless AGN power-law continuum, Fe II
pseudocontinuum, and a residual, pure emission-line spectrum,
closely following the treatment described in Ho & Kim (2009).
We perform a multi-component Gaussian ﬁt of the continuum-
subtracted spectrum to derive ﬂuxes, widths, and radial veloci-
ties of the major broad and narrow emission lines (see bottom
panels of each object in Figure 1). To isolate the broad Hα line,
we follow previous practice (e.g., Ho et al. 1997) and constrain
the proﬁle of [N II] λλ6548, 6583 and the narrow component
of Hα to that of [S II] λλ6716, 6731. Likewise, we tie the nar-
row component of Hβ to [O III] λ5007. Each of the lines of the
[S II] doublet usually can be ﬁt adequately with a single Gaus-
sian, whereas [O III] requires an extended, often blueshifted,
wing component in addition to a Gaussian core. The ﬁnal,

have been normalized to unity and shifted vertically for the purposes of the

ﬁtted parameters for the broad and narrow emission lines are
listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

The Ca II infrared (IR) triplets (λλλ8498, 8542, 8662) are
ideal features for deriving stellar velocity dispersions, espe-
cially for composite stellar populations and AGN host galax-
ies, because of their relative insensitivity to template mismatch
(Dressler 1984) and reduced contamination from nonstellar
emission (Barth et al. 2002; Greene & Ho 2006a). The three
sources with the lowest redshifts cover the Ca II IR triplets in

detections of broad Hα emission with the BH masses estimated by Kamizasa
et al. (2012) based on X-ray variability. The solid line denotes the 1:1 relation.
The virial BH masses are assumed to have uncertainties of 0.5 dex.

FIG. 4.— The MBH - σ∗ relation (solid line with shaded 1σ scatter) of inac-

symbols; this paper). For the sake of clarity, error bars are not shown for the
inactive sample. Classical bulges and ellipticals are plotted in dark color; pseu-
dobulges are plotted in a lighter shade. We assume that the low-mass objects

width of the core of [O III] λ5007; the three objects with σ∗ directly measured
using the Ca II IR triplets are highlighted with a solid red point.

their bandpass, and these features are detected clearly in all of
them (Figure 2). We use the direct pixel-ﬁtting method, as im-
plemented in Ho et al. (2009), in conjunction with a K0 III ve-
locity template star observed during the same observing run, to
derive σ∗ = 43.9 ± 4.3 km s- 1 for 2XMMi J032459.9- 025612,
σ∗ = 88.1 ± 5.7 km s- 1 for 2XMM J134736.4+173404, and
σ∗ = 76.3 ± 7.9 km s- 1 for 2XMM J200824.5- 444009. The
errors account for ﬁtting uncertainties but not for uncertainties
due to choice of velocity templates, as we did not observe a
large number of stars. However, comparison with the previous
work of Xiao et al. (2011), who studied similar objects using
MagE in exactly the same instrumental setup, veriﬁes that our
error estimates (∼ 10%) are realistic.

3. BROAD Hα, BLACK HOLE MASSES, AND EDDINGTON RATIOS
We detect unambiguous broad Hα emission in all 12 sources
and broad Hβ emission in 8 out of 12, conﬁrming that all are
genuine type 1 AGNs. 2XMM J123103.2+110648 remains the
only example of a pure type 2 source (Ho et al. 2012) in the
sample of Kamizasa et al.
(2012). The broad Hα luminosi-
ties range from ∼ 1040 to 1042 erg s- 1, with a median value
of 2.5 × 1041 erg s- 1, close to 1 order of magnitude less lumi-
nous than the peak of distribution of optically selected z ∼< 0.35
type 1 AGNs (Greene & Ho 2007b), but similar to the subsam-
ple of type 1 AGNs with MBH < 2 × 106 M⊙ (Greene & Ho
2007c). Given the low-mass selection of our sample, it is not
surprising that the widths of broad Hα are low (median FWHM
= 934 km s- 1), well below the ﬁducial threshold of 2000 km s- 1
for narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (Osterbrock & Pogge 1985).
The broad Hα measurements afford us the opportunity to
reevaluate the BH masses and Eddington ratios of the sample.

dBH mass estimated from the MBH − σ∗ relation for pseudobulges, as given by Ho & Kim (2014).

We estimate virial BH masses using the formalism for single-
epoch spectra, recently recalibrated for the Hβ line by Ho &
Kim (2015), which takes into consideration the dependence of
the virial coefﬁcient (so-called f -factor) on bulge type (Ho &
Kim 2014), as well as the latest updates to the MBH - σ∗ re-
lation of inactive galaxies (Kormendy & Ho 2013), on which
the calibration of the f -factor is based. As our sample specif-

ically targets low-mass BHs, we expect, from experience with
other similar samples (Greene et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2011b),
that the host galaxies contain pseudobulges. The BH mass es-
timator of Ho & Kim (2015) is based on the FWHM of broad
Hβ and the AGN continuum luminosity at 5100 Å, whereas the
primary measurements in this study come from the FWHM and
luminosity of broad Hα. Greene & Ho (2005b) show that the

where k = 6.76 for classical bulges and k = 6.35 for pseudob-
ulges. In this paper, we adopt the zero point for pseudobulges.
The uncertainty on the masses is ∼ 0.5 dex, based on the in-
trinsic scatter of the empirical calibrations (Ho & Kim 2014,
2015).

The new masses range from MBH ≈ 1.9 × 105 to 8.3 × 106
M⊙, with a median value of 1.2 × 106 M⊙. This conﬁrms
that the selection method of Kamizasa et al.
(2012), based
on X-ray variability, indeed does isolate low-mass BHs effec-
tively. However, a direct comparison between their X-ray–
based masses and ours (Figure 3) reveals large discrepancies.
Whereas the virial masses span nearly 2 dex, most of the X-
ray–based masses are conﬁned to a very narrow range of only
∼ 0.3 dex. Moreover, the scatter is not random: the X-ray–
based masses are systematically higher than the virial masses,
on average by ∼ 0.4 dex. While large uncertainties no doubt
enter into the virial mass estimates, especially in the low-mass
regime where the empirical calibrations remain poorly tested,
we have reasonable conﬁdence that our derived masses are not
affected by large, systematic biases because they more-or-less
follow the MBH - σ∗ relation, at least within the relatively large
scatter in the pseudobulge regime of the correlation (Figure 4).

This has been established for other samples of low-mass type 1
AGNs (Barth et al. 2005; Greene & Ho 2006b; Xiao et al. 2011;
see also Jiang et al. 2011a). For the present analysis, we only
have direct stellar velocity dispersions for three sources (Sec-
tion 2); as for the rest, we assume σ∗ = FWHM[O III]/2.35 (ap-
propriate for a Gaussian proﬁle), where FWHM[O III] pertains
to the core of the line. This approximation has been shown to
be valid (Nelson & Whittle 1996; Greene & Ho 2005a), es-
pecially for lower-ionization lines such as [S II] or [N II] (Ho
2009). The [S II] and [O III] lines of our sample have very sim-
ilar FWHM values, and so we choose the measurements based
on the stronger [O III] line.

The offset between the virial and X-ray–based BH masses
can be compensated by adopting in equation 1 the zero point for
classical bulges instead of pseudobulges, which differs by pre-
cisely this amount (∼ 0.4 dex). However, as discussed above,
we have strong reason to believe that these low-mass AGNs are
hosted by pseudobulges.
Next, we convert the broad Hα luminosities to bolomet-
ric luminosities, using the LHα,b - L5100 relation of Greene &
Ho (2007c) and a canonical bolometric correction of Lbol =
9.8L5100
(McLure & Dunlop 2004). The resulting Edding-
ton ratios are surprisingly high (λE ≈ 0.1 - 2; median λE =
0.44), not dissimilar from the optically selected sample of
Greene & Ho (2007c). The bolometric luminosity can be esti-
mated alternatively from the available X-ray luminosity, using
a luminosity-dependent X-ray bolometric correction factor (Ho
2008). Adopting Lbol = 20LX for the 2–10 keV band (Vasude-
van & Fabian 2007), we ﬁnd consistent values of λE ≈ 0.1 - 1,
with a median value of λE = 0.38.

We note, in agreement with Kamizasa et al. (2012), that the
hard X-ray (2–10 keV) photon index does not correlate with BH
mass or Eddington ratio in the manner predicted from extrapo-
lation of AGN samples of higher mass and luminosity (Fig. 5).

Star-forming galaxies are located to the left of the dashed line, AGNs are found
to the right of the solid line, and composite sources lie in between (Kewley et
al. 2006).

4. CONSTRAINTS ON STAR FORMATION RATE

The spectra exhibit a rich set of narrow emission lines gen-
erally consistent with AGN photoionization. On the [O III]
λ5007/Hβ versus [N II] λ6583/Hα diagnostic diagram (Fig-
ure 6), most of the objects lie in the region intermediate between
high-excitation star-forming galaxies and classical Seyferts, a
manifestation of the relatively low metallicity associated with
the lower-mass host galaxies in our study (Ludwig et al. 2012).
Our sources overlap well with other samples of type 1 (Barth
et al. 2004; Greene & Ho 2004, 2007c) and type 2 (Barth et
al. 2008) low-mass AGNs. As was found for the Greene &
Ho (2007c) sample, some of the sources in our sample (5/13)
have narrow-line intensity ratios that formally place them in the
territory of star-forming galaxies. We suspect that star forma-
tion contaminates the integrated spectra of these objects, and
possibly others in our sample.

Can the star formation rate (SFR) be constrained in these sys-
tems? Ho (2005) proposed that the strength of [O II] λ3727,
normally a widely used SFR indicator in star-forming galax-
ies at intermediate redshifts, can also be utilized for this pur-
pose in AGNs. The fundamental premise behind this idea is
that, while the narrow-line regions of AGNs certainly also emit
[O II], the level of [O II] emission in high-excitation sources
(i.e. Seyferts and quasars) is well-constrained by the level of
[O III] λ5007, which can be directly observed. The intensity
ratio [O II]/[O III], which varies strongly with the ionization pa-
rameter, decreases with increasing [O III] luminosity (Kim et al.
2006). To zeroth order, all of the [O III] emission in luminous
AGNs comes from nonstellar photoionization. Star

tion from Panessa et al. (2006), with the 1 σ scatter denoted by the two dashed

the 0.5–2 keV band assuming a photon index of Γ = 1.8. For the objects stud-
ied in this paper and in Ho et al. (2012), we conservatively assign a uncertainty

formation,
if present, contributes negligibly to [O III] be-
cause the host galaxies, being massive in general for luminous
Seyferts and quasars, should have high metallicity (Tremonti et
al. 2004). Thus, given an observed strength of [O III] in an
AGN, its associated level of [O II] emission can be predicted,
and any “excess” beyond that can be attributed to star formation
(Ho 2005; Kim et al. 2006).

The [O II]-based technique to measure SFRs in AGNs de-
pends on a critical condition:
that the host galaxy has high
metallicity. Unfortunately, this requirement breaks down for
low-mass galaxies, and, at sufﬁciently high redshifts, even for
high-mass galaxies. O-star photoionization of low-metallicity
gas produces high-excitation H II regions, which, like AGNs,
emit strong [O III] λ5007 (Osterbrock 1989). Here, we sug-
gest that this difﬁculty can be circumvented with the help of an
additional constraint from X-ray observations. The extinction-
corrected [O III] luminosity of Compton-thin AGNs correlates
well with the intrinsic X-ray luminosity (Bassani et al. 1999),
over a wide range of luminosities and masses (Panessa et al.
2006; Stern & Laor 2012), including optically selected low-
mass AGNs (Dong et al. 2009; Ho et al. 2012). Hence, pro-
vided that a robust X-ray detection is available, we can deduce
roughly the corresponding [O III] luminosity that should be as-
sociated with the AGN, and thereby also its fractional contribu-
tion to the [O II] emission.

Figure 7 conﬁrms that some of the objects in the current sam-
ple of AGNs selected by X-ray variability indeed do depart sys-
tematically from the canonical LX - L[O III] correlation. For

5. THE PECULIAR NARROW-LINE KINEMATICS OF

2XMM J200824.5- 444009

We draw attention to the highly unusual kinematics of the
narrow emission lines in 2XMM J200824.5- 444009 (Figure 1).
The proﬁle of [O III] λλ4959, 5007 qualiﬁes the source as
“double-peaked”, but in other objects of this class the two com-
ponents typically have comparable widths (e.g., Liu et al. 2010;
Smith et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2011; Comerford et al. 2012; Ge
et al. 2012). Here, the two components have very different pro-
ﬁles: a sharp, core with FWHM = 175 km s- 1 plus an extremely
broad component with FWHM = 870 km s- 1 blueshifted by
381 km s- 1. This characteristic double-component structure
is clearly present in Hβ, and, although less obvious visually,
also in [S II]. It is crucial to properly account for this complex
narrow-line proﬂe to deblend narrow Hα and [N II], in order to
obtain an accurate measurement of broad Hα.

6. SUMMARY

AGNs with MBH ∼< 106 M⊙ are an important constituent for
understanding the full demography of central BHs. The vast
majority of currently known low-mass AGNs derive from op-
tical selection. In a recent study, Kamizasa et al. (2012) pre-
sented a sample of candidate low-mass BHs based on X-ray
variability characteristics. We used the Magellan 6.5m Clay
telescope to obtain high-quality, optical echellette spectra of 12
out of the 15 sources from Kamizasa’s sample. Broad Hα emis-
sion is unambiguously detected in all the objects, permitting us
to calculate robust virial BH masses and Eddington ratios. We
conﬁrm that the sample contains low-mass BHs accreting at a
high fraction of their Eddington rate: median MBH ≈ 1.2 × 106
M⊙; median λE = 0.44. Assuming the AGNs to be hosted by
pseudobulges, our BH masses are signiﬁcantly and systemat-
ically larger than those estimated from X-ray variability. The
moderately high resolution of our spectra allow us to measure
the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, either di-
rectly from stars or indirectly from ionized gas. We show that
the virial BH masses follow the MBH - σ∗ relation of pseudob-
ulges. Lastly, we argue that at least some of the objects have
ongoing star formation, and we introduce a method to estimate
the SFRs of low-metallicity AGN host galaxies based on mea-
surements of X-rays and optical emission lines.

FIG. 8.— Dependence of [O II]/[O III] ratio on extincton-corrected [O III]
luminosity. The solid line is the empirical relation derived from a large sample
of type 1 AGNs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Kim et al. 2006).
Most of the sample lies systematically above the relation, expecially the ﬁve
sources that deviate the most from the LX - L[O III] correlation (Figure 7), in the
sense that at a given [O III] luminosity there is “extra” [O II] emission, which
we argue originates from and hence traces star formation in the host galaxy.

illustrative purposes, we highlight (red squares with cyan cen-
ters) the ﬁve objects that formally lie outside the 1σ scatter of
the LX - L[O III] relation of Panessa et al. (2006), in the sense that
at a given X-ray luminosity they are overluminous in [O III] by
a factor of ∼ 3. This is to be expected, if, as we suspect, high-
excitation H II regions contribute to the integrated [O III] emis-
sion in our sample of low-mass AGNs, which most likely live in
low-mass, low-metallicity host galaxies. These very same ﬁve
objects stand out as having systematically higher [O II]/[O III]
ratios for their [O III] luminosities (Figure 8), indicating that
star formation contributes to their [O II] emission.
(Interest-
ingly, however, they do not stand out in any obvious way in the
traditional dignostic diagram in Figure 6.)

a metallicity of 0.5 solar. Most objects have rather modest
SFRs (∼< 1 M⊙ yr- 1; Table 4).
