Abstract
The potential of an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to detect gamma-ray sources in complex
regions has been investigated. The basic characteristics of the gamma-ray instrument have been parametrized using
simple analytic representations. In addition to the ideal (Gaussian form) point spread function (PSF), the impact of
more realistic non-Gaussian PSFs with tails has been considered. Simulations of isolated point-like and extended
sources have been used as a benchmark to test and understand the response of the instrument. The capability of the
instrument to resolve multiple sources has been analyzed and the corresponding instrument sensitivities calculated.
The results are of particular interest for weak gamma-ray emitters located in crowded regions of the Galactic plane,
where the chance of clustering of two or more gamma-ray sources within 1 degree is high.

Keywords: instrumentations: detectors, gamma rays: general, Cherenkov telescopes.

1. Introduction

High energy gamma rays are ideal carriers of infor-
mation about non thermal relativistic processes in astro-
physical objects. They are copiously produced in many
Galactic and Extragalactic sources and freely propa-
gate in space without deﬂection by interstellar and inter-
galactic magnetic ﬁelds. At very high energies, gamma-
rays can be eﬀectively detected by ground-based in-
struments. Among various techniques, the Imaging At-
mospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) technique has
proven to be the most sensitive approach [1, 2, 3, 4].

In recent years, ground based telescopes such as
H.E.S.S. [5], MAGIC [6] and VERITAS [7], have
demonstrated the great potential oﬀered by IACT
stereoscopic arrays. These instruments have proven
themselves as eﬀective multifunctional tools for spec-
tral, temporal, and morphological studies of gamma-ray
sources at energies above a few tens of GeV.

The optimal instrument conﬁguration for a next-
generation IACT array should follow from the particu-
lar science goals. For instance, the studies of blazars and
Gamma-Ray Bursts demand very low energy thresholds

to extend the gamma-ray horizon to cosmological dis-
tances. On the other hand, for TeV Galactic sources,
e.g. Supernova Remnants and Pulsar Wind Nebulae, the
extension of the energy coverage up to 100 TeV is of
prime importance.

In the sub-TeV regime the main target is to lower the
energy threshold. Lower energy gamma-rays produce
smaller showers and correspondingly less Cherenkov
light. The energy threshold can be lowered by increas-
ing the mirror area of the telescopes, by using focal
plane detectors with high quantum eﬃciency or by plac-
ing the instrument at higher altitude (see e.g. ref. [8]).

In the TeV regime, the ﬂux level sharply drops due
to the typical power-law spectral shape of non-thermal
processes. Thus, it is necessary to maximize the eﬀec-
tive area in this energy domain. This can be achieved
with a large array of wide-ﬁeld telescopes spread-out in
a grid covering an area of several square kilometers.

The upcoming next-generation IACT array,

the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) [9], will exploit
three diﬀerent sizes of telescopes, each one optimized
for low (multi-GeV), medium (TeV) and high (multi-
TeV) energies. Thanks to its wide energy range, excel-
lent angular and energy resolution and huge detection
area, CTA is expected to provide a deep insight into the

In this paper, we use the CTA observatory as a tem-
plate for the description of a generic IACT array. With
simple analysis methods we address questions of pri-
mary importance for planning IACTs observations. We
demonstrate the importance of such questions for draw-
ing general conclusions independent of the speciﬁc in-
strument details, since at this stage absolute results
might not be meaningful given the possible changes
in the ﬁnal layout design of CTA. With these ultimate
goals, we study the potential of the array for the detec-
tion of weak gamma-ray sources in complex environ-
ments in the presence of multiple strong TeV emitters.

2. Instrument response

To investigate the performance of the telescope ar-
ray, the simulated sources need to be convolved with
the instrument response. Given the diﬀerent perfor-
mance at diﬀerent energy intervals and, in general, dif-
ferent physics goals, we distinguish four energy inter-
vals: [0.05-0.1] TeV, [0.1-1] TeV, [1-10] TeV and [10-
100] TeV. This is the wide energy region covered by the
CTA South array, particularly suitable for observation
of the Galactic plane which is rich in TeV emitters be-
longing to several source populations. A total of 4 large-
size, a few tens of medium-size and about 70 small-size
telescopes will form the array at the CTA southern site,
whose layout is under consideration. The instrument
response functions for the southern array of CTA we
used in this work consist of 4 large-size telescopes, 24
medium-size telescopes and 72 small-size telescopes.
The performance is obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) sim-
ulations of a point-like gamma-ray source with a spec-
tral shape similar to that of the Crab Nebula, located at
the centre of the ﬁeld of view (FoV) and observed at a
zenith angle of 20 degrees [10]. From these publicly
available distributions1 simple analytical parameteriza-
tions in the energy range from 50 GeV to 100 TeV are
derived for the angular resolution, eﬀective area, energy
resolution and background rate per unit of solid angle
after rejection cuts. In table 1 the values for the angular
resolution, eﬀective area and background rate are shown
for all four energy intervals.

energy.

The angular resolution is here deﬁned as the angular
radius that contains 68% of the gamma-ray point spread
function (PSF). For morphological studies the shape of
the PSF is a key issue. To ﬁrst approximation the an-
gular resolution can be described by a two-dimensional
Gaussian distribution:

The speciﬁc values of σPS F used in this work are pro-
vided in table 1. In general, for a wide variety of tele-
scopes operating in diﬀerent energy bands of electro-
magnetic spectrum, in addition to the central Gaussian
component, the PSF might contain tails extending well
away from the peak. To account for the presence of

such tails and to study the eﬀect of their impact on the
resolution of weak gamma-ray sources, a non-Gaussian

(3)

The tails of the non-Gaussian PSF are described by a
second Gaussian function having a width σPS Ftails, ﬁxed
to the ﬁducial value of 0.2 deg (assuming a worst case
scenario). The ratio K of the normalization factor of the
main and the secondary Gaussian was adjusted to de-
scribe the eﬀects of diﬀerent tails, namely, the values
considered are: 0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.01 and 0.001. In Fig.
2 the PSFs corresponding to these values are shown in
the energy interval from 1 to 10 TeV, where the instru-
ment is expected to reach the best performance in terms
of sensitivity. The black curve is for the case of sin-
gle Gaussian PSF, described by Eq. [2]. The colored
dashed curves are for the non-Gaussian PSF with tails
described by Eq. [3]. Note that, even if disregarded in
this study for the sake of simplicity, the location of the
source within the FoV will also modify the PSF value,
depending on the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the telescopes.
However, this eﬀect is negligible for energies lower than
∼ 10 TeV, for which the PSF can be considered ﬂat up
to 4◦, and only a slight degradation of the PSF (by a
factor (cid:46) 2) might occur at higher energies [12]. More-
over, it is important to highlight that the use of the HESS
modeling for the non-Gaussian PSF, as reported in ref.
[11], has to be considered here as a conservative upper
limit. With tens of telescopes, the CTA observatory is

expected to do better and this especially concerns the
observations at the high energies, i.e. E ≥ 10 TeV. In
fact, although a constant value of σPS Ftails is assumed
in this work by virtue of the HESS results, a reduction
of the tails size is likely to take place as the energy in-
creases, due to the larger telescope multiplicity which
should reduce the PSF ﬂuctuations responsible for the
tails. The energy dependence of the PSF tails is be-
yond the goals of this paper. Nevertheless, detailed MC
studies aimed to explore the eﬀect of the tails on the
instrument performance and their relevance in diﬀerent
energy domains might represent an extremely important
task for the upcoming CTA observatory.

2.2. Eﬀective Area

While for a single telescope the eﬀective area is de-
termined by the radius of the Cherenkov light pool at
ground (rlight−pool ∼ 120 m), the eﬀective detection area
of a multi-telescope system is determined essentially by
the total geometrical area [13], as can be seen in Fig. 3.
For the considered layout of the CTA South observatory,
the eﬀective detection area Ae f f can be parametrized
with the following expression in the energy range from
50 GeV to 100 TeV:

Ae f f (x) =

A

where the saturation value of the eﬀective area is A =

2.3. Energy resolution

The energy resolution of the instrument, referring to
the public CTA MC results, is shown in Fig. 4. Al-
though energy resolution is rather modest in the low en-
ergy range (approximately 20% around 50 GeV), it sig-
niﬁcantly improves at higher energies saturating at the
level of 6 to 8% from 1 TeV to 100 TeV. The energy de-
pendence of the resolution can be parametrized in the
following form:

(∆E/E) (x) = A ×(cid:104)

(x − B)2 + (x − B)4(cid:105)

+ C

(5)

with the normalization factor A taking the value A =
6.33 · 10−3, the parameter B = 8.34 · 10−1 ﬁxing the
value of the energy for which the resolution takes its
best value and C = 6.24 · 10−2 representing the best
energy resolution achievable with the telescope layout
considered in this work. A detailed study of the energy
resolution eﬀects on the observation potential of a CTA-
like instrument is beyond the framework of this paper
and will be addressed in a future work.

2.4. Background rate

The simulated rate of background events after all the
rejection cuts that we used in our study is shown in Fig.
5 as function of the energy. Simulations were set up by
the CTA Consortium assuming power-law spectra, ex-
cept for the electron and positron background, the latter
being described by a log-normal peak on top of an E−3.21
power-law spectrum. For the background rate initiated
by protons and nuclei of cosmic rays, an E−α depen-
dence has been adopted, with α ranging from 2.70 for

protons to 2.63 for iron, see e.g. ref. [14]. The noise
from the night-sky background (∼ 100 MHz for 100 m2
dish and 0.15◦ pixel2, corresponding to dark-sky obser-
vations towards an extra-Galactic ﬁeld [15]) and from
electronics is added as well. On the simulated back-
ground showers, selection cuts are then applied in order
to suppress events not induced by gamma-rays (for the
details on the analysis performed by the CTA Collabo-
ration see e.g. [10]). For the surviving events, the en-
ergy dependence of the overall background rate can be
approximated to the following form:

with A1 = 3.87 · 10−1 Hz/deg2, µ1 = −1.25, σ1 = 2.26 ·

and C = 3.78 · 10−6 Hz/deg2.

For each energy interval, we computed the mean
number of spurious events NBgRate scaling the rate
BgRate by the observation time and by the angular
area. In order to take into account ﬂuctuations in the
background, we randomly sampled the number of back-
ground events NB from a Poissonian distribution: f (NB |
λ) = (λNBe−λ)/NB!, with expected value λ = NBgRate.
2.5. Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the telescope is deﬁned as the mini-
mum ﬂux of gamma rays required for a statistically sig-
niﬁcant detection. The publicly available CTA sensi-
tivity curve is obtained from detailed MC simulations

data [10], calculated for the observation of a point-like
source with a Crab-like energy spectrum. For the cal-
culation of the instrument sensitivity one needs to spec-
ify the requirements to accept a signal as statistically
signiﬁcant in a certain observation time scale.
In the
case of the ground-based gamma-ray instruments it is
usually reduced to two conditions (see e.g.
[13]): (i)
the presence of at least 10 excess events and (ii) a sig-
niﬁcance of at least ﬁve standard deviations calculated
according to the formulation of Li & Ma [16]. In ad-
dition, in order to account for the background system-
atics, a minimum signal excess over the background
uncertainty is required. Regarding this last point, the
CTA prescription is to assume an accuracy of the back-
ground modeling and subtraction of 1% of the remain-
ing background events, and to require a signal excess at
ﬁve times this 1% background systematic uncertainty.
In summary, for the computation of the diﬀerential sen-
sitivity, the following conditions have been applied by
the CTA Consortium for each energy interval (ﬁve in-
tervals per decade of reconstructed energy, i.e. intervals
of the decimal exponent of 0.2):

• S ≥ 10
• Nσ ≥ 5
• S /B ≥ 0.05

where S and B denote the signal and background events
in the source region, which in the Li & Ma notation cor-
respond to Non = S + B and No f f = B/α, with α be-
ing the ratio of the on-source time to the oﬀ-source time
during which Non and No f f photons are counted, respec-
tively, and which also depends on the diﬀerent integra-
tion regions used to estimate the two.

3. Morphological studies

In this section we start from simulations of an isolated
source and use them as a benchmark to test the instru-
ment performance for diﬀerent observation modes. First
the event rates and the background regimes are inves-
tigated. Then the morphological reconstruction of the
isolated source, aimed to estimate its center of gravity
and its angular size, is evaluated assuming both Gaus-
sian and non-Gaussian PSFs. To reconstruct the signal
(S ), a χ2-ﬁtting is conservatively used here for simplic-
ity; more sophisticated approaches (see e.g. [17, 18])
might improve the results shown below.

3.1. Isolated source simulation
For simulating the source we created an excess map
of 3◦ × 3◦ with pixel size of 0.03◦. The map was ﬁlled
with both signal and background events. The back-
ground events were uniformly distributed in the map,
whereas the gamma-ray source was simulated assuming
a Gaussian shape described as:

f (x, y) = A · exp

(7)

centered on the point (X0, Y0) = (0, 0) deg and character-
ized by the size σsrc. The normalization factor A takes
into account the strength of the gamma-ray source. Con-
cerning the size of the source, three diﬀerent scenarios
have been investigated:

• σsrc = 0.03 deg; this is smaller than the PSF in any
energy band, therefore the source can be consid-
ered as a point-like source;

• σsrc = 0.1 deg;

this is comparable to the PSF,
therefore the source can be considered as a mod-
erately extended source;

• σsrc = 0.2 deg; this is larger than the PSF (∼ 2
times), therefore the source can be considered as
an extended source.

In each energy interval and for each of these three angu-
lar scales, we simulated gamma-ray detection assuming
the following form for the gamma-ray ﬂux:

= n · N0 ×(cid:18) E

(8)

with α = 2.62 which corresponds to the Crab power-
law spectrum as measured by HEGRA [19]. The ﬂux
strength is given in units of Crab ﬂux at 1 TeV: N0 =
2.83 · 10−11 TeV−1cm−2s−1.

3.2. Event rates and background regimes

dius rROI = (cid:112)

In Fig. 6 the rates for the signal S and for the back-
ground B events as well as the ratio S /B are shown for
diﬀerent source ﬂux strengths and source sizes. To es-
timate the S and B in the region of interest (ROI), we
derive the number of photons from a region on the sig-
nal and background maps respectively, deﬁned as a cir-
cle centered on the center of the source and having ra-
(2σsrc)2 + (2σPS F)2, which in the case of
point-like objects is reduced to RROI = 2σPS F. On the
upper horizontal axis of each plot the corresponding ﬂux
levels for an E−2 power-law spectrum are shown in units
of Crab at 1 TeV. Although the source regions have been
ﬁlled with the same number of events for each assumed

The three sets of curves correspond to three sizes of the source: 0.03 deg (dotted lines), 0.1 deg (dashed lines) and 0.2 deg (solid lines). The event
rates are calculated for diﬀerent ROI of the signal, depending on the source size (see text for more details).

the source extension, in the low energy intervals the sig-
nal rate S slightly diﬀers depending on the source size.
This is due to the larger σPS F at these energies, which
spreads out events on a larger scale, pushing events that
belong to the tails of the source distribution to fall out-
side the ROI.

When S /B < 1, the detection proceeds in the back-
ground dominated regime. For larger values (presented
in table 2 for each energy interval) the detection pro-
ceeds in the background free regime. The integrated
ﬂux in the region comprised by sources of diﬀerent size
is normalized to the same value (or percent of the Crab
ﬂux). Therefore, to achieve the S /B = 1 condition, the
required ﬂux is higher for larger source sizes.

where T is the observation time and RS and RB are the
event rates for signal and background, respectively. For
a given observation time, when RB (cid:29) RS , then S /N ∝
RS and when RB (cid:28) RS , then S /N ∝ √
RS . Thus, we
expect a linear dependence of S /N as a function of the
ﬂux strength in the background dominated regime, and a
square root dependence when the signal dominates over
the background. This trend can be seen in Fig. 7.

like source emitting photons according to the Crab-like energy spec-
trum and observed for 50 h). Four diﬀerent energy domains are
shown: (0.05-0.1) TeV in black, (0.1-1) TeV in red, (1-10) TeV in
green and (10-100) TeV in blue.

where σPS F depends on the energy interval (see table
1). Using a sample of tens of realizations of the simula-
tion and treating σPS F as a ﬁxed parameter, we can es-
timate the size σsrc and the center of gravity (X0, Y0) by
performing a χ2-ﬁtting analysis to the Gaussian shaped
spatial distribution of the source.

We simulated the skymap for diﬀerent observation
durations and estimated the minimum time needed to
properly reconstruct the morphology of the source. This
is deﬁned as the minimum time such that the relative er-
ror on the reconstructed parameter (both center of grav-
ity and size) is reduced to at least 1% and its mean value
is not more than 3 sigma away from its simulated value.
We also required a minimum of 10 signal photons on the
source region. In Fig. 8 the minimum time needed to re-
construct the center of gravity is shown as a function of
the ﬂux strength in four energy intervals3.

One can see that

the shortest minimum time is
required in the energy 100 GeV-1 TeV and 1-10 TeV
bands, where the combination of best performance
and reasonable statistics are found. At very low (50-
100 GeV) and very high (10-100 TeV) energies the re-
quired time is signiﬁcantly increased because of the
poor performance and low photon statistics, respec-
tively.

One should also note that the minimum time required
to reconstruct the source position is always larger for ex-
tended sources than for point-like sources. The reason

3Note that for the shorter observation times the results should be
taken with caution since the analytical parameterizations shown in §2
are obtained from the CTA simulations optimized for 50 hours obser-
vation time.

therefore the photon density is lower than in the case of
point sources.

The same tendency is observed for the minimum time
needed to estimate the source size. The results are
shown in Fig. 9.

3.5. Reconstruction of morphological parameters for

non-Gaussian PSF response

In this subsection we repeated the simulations de-
scribed in the previous subsection using a non-Gaussian
PSF shape (see Eq. 3). The gamma-ray source is recon-
structed using Eq. [10] to investigate the eﬀect of tails
on the morphological reconstruction when these are not
properly evaluated. The results are summarized in Fig.
10. Each panel corresponds to the reconstructed source
size obtained for the four energy intervals deﬁned in §2.
The reconstructed value is shown for diﬀerent ﬂux lev-
els and diﬀerent values of the parameter K in Eq. 3. The
grey solid line at 0.1 deg indicates the size value used in
the simulation.

In the lowest energy domain ([0.05, 0.1] TeV), where
the background dominates, the results for sources with
ﬂuxes ≤ 0.1 C. U. are strongly aﬀected by ﬂuctuations.
For brighter sources a proper estimation of the size can
be done when the ratio K is in the 0.01 to 0.001 range.
The value of the PSF (σPS F = 0.147 deg) at these ener-
gies, comparable to the σPS Ftails = 0.2 deg, results in a
relatively small eﬀect of the tails for small K values. As
expected, when K is very large (K ∼ 0.3), the PSF can-
not be described by a simple single Gaussian function
and the eﬀect of the wider distribution prevents a proper
reconstruction of the real size of the source.

The value of σPS F improves with energy (see Fig.
1), resulting in a more dramatic eﬀect when adding
σPS Ftails to the description of the PSF shape. The re-
sults in Fig. 10 shows that the larger the ratio K, the
more signiﬁcant the deviation from the expected value.
This is true only when the tail contributions amounts to
at least 5% of the peak value.

4. Detection sensitivity for multiple sources in the

same FoV

The study of two objects side by side has been per-
formed. A ﬁrst point-like gamma-ray source has been
placed in the proximity of a second object. Hereafter
we refer to the ﬁrst source as test source, being the target
of the observation, and to the other one as background
source, since the gamma photons emitted by this nearby
object represent an additional source of background for
the test source.

9

4.1. Two neighbor sources

The Crab-like spectrum deﬁned by Eq. [8] has been
used both for the test and the background source. The
shape of the two objects has been simulated according
to the Gaussian distribution in Eq.
[7], characterized
by the angular sizes σtestS rc and σbkgS rc for which three
diﬀerent cases have been considered:

• σtestS rc = 0.03 deg and σbkgS rc = 0.03 deg;
• σtestS rc = 0.03 deg and σbkgS rc = 0.1 deg;
• σtestS rc = 0.03 deg and σbkgS rc = 0.2 deg.

4.1.1. Event rate

Gamma-ray photons from the background source
reaching the region of the observation limit the ability
to resolve the main object. Therefore, the closer the
background source, the higher the total amount of back-
ground. This eﬀect is clearly seen in Fig. 11, where
the total background rate RB = RCR + RbkgS rc is shown
as a function of the distance between the two sources in
the case of a Gaussian PSF. RbkgS rc represents the addi-
tional noise due to the photons coming from the back-
ground source, while RCR is the standard background
rate due to the cosmic rays. Comparing diﬀerent hy-
pothesis for the background source size, we found that
extended sources (σbkgS rc > σPS F) contaminate the cos-
mic ray background rate up to 0.6 deg separation from
the test source. On the contrary, when the nearby back-
ground source is point-like, this eﬀect on the back-
ground rate disappears as soon as the distance between
the two objects is larger than 0.3 deg, irrespective of the
ﬂux strength of the companion.

Similar calculations have been conducted under the
assumption of a non-Gaussian PSF: the results are
shown in Fig. 12. Apparently, the tails contribute signif-
icantly to the background, especially at large distances
from the gamma-ray background source. One can see
that for the parameters used in these calculations, a sig-
niﬁcant contribution from the background source can
extend up to 1 degree, i.e. an order of magnitude larger
than the PSF. A comparison of Fig. 11 and Fig. 12
shows that this eﬀect is apparently caused by the tails of
the PSF.

In Fig. 13 and 14 we show the energy dependence
of diﬀerential event rates for two diﬀerent distances be-
tween the test and the background gamma-ray sources:
0.1 deg and 0.3 deg. The curves in Fig. 13 are obtained
for the pure Gaussian distribution of the PSF, while
Fig. 14 corresponds to the non-Gaussian PSF with tails
(K = 0.3). The results of this section indicate that, in the

presence of neighboring gamma-ray sources, the back-
ground for the test source can signiﬁcantly exceed (de-
pending on the ﬂux of the background source and its
distance from the test source) the rate of background
events induced by cosmic rays. This would result in a
signiﬁcant reduction of the sensitivity of observations,
speciﬁcally in regions rich in gamma-ray sources.

4.1.2. The sensitivity

CTA foresees improving beyond the sensitivity of
current ground-based high-energy gamma-ray instru-
ments by an order of magnitude. This factor concerns
the observations of a single point-like object, isolated
from any other source. However, it is expected that such
an improvement of sensitivity will dramatically increase

the number of known gamma-ray sources. Correspond-
ingly, the average distance between sources will also be
reduced, especially in the Galactic plane. In this case
the background for the test source caused by the sur-
rounding gamma-ray sources can be comparable to, or
even exceed, the background induced by cosmic rays.
This implies that the sensitivity curves obtained under
the assumption of only cosmic ray background may sig-
niﬁcantly overestimate the capability of the instrument
to resolve weak sources.

Following the criteria used by the CTA Consortium to
compute the diﬀerential sensitivity curve [14], we esti-
mated the ﬂux sensitivity for 50 hours of observation of
an object with a spectrum given by Eq. [8] placed close
to a companion described by the same spectrum. The

This results in a sensi-
tivity range instead of a curve, deﬁned by the edges of
the ﬂux bin in which the minimum detectable ﬂux is
reached. This minimum ﬂux is obtained binning the en-
ergy spectrum from 50 GeV to 100 TeV in ﬁve indepen-
dent logarithmic bins per decade of energy, as in [14].
For each energy bin the requirements described in §2.5
are applied.

Figure 15: Diﬀerential ﬂux sensitivities for a point-like test source
corresponding to 50h observation time. The range of sensitivities are
shown by shaded regions. The upper and lower edges of these re-
gions indicate the uncertainties of simulations related to the discrete
ﬂux levels (see the text). The calculations are performed under the
assumption of the existence of a neighbor point-like gamma-ray back-
ground source of strength 0.1 Crab. The green, red and blue regions
correspond to the location of the neighbor source at distances of 0.1,
0.3 and 0.5 degrees, correspondingly. In calculations we assumed a
pure Gaussian distribution for the PSF. The publicly available sensi-
tivity expected by the CTA for a point-like source is also reported in
the ﬁgure (black dashed curve)1.

In Fig.

15, we show the diﬀerential sensitivity
(shaded area) to detect a point-like source when located
in proximity to a second point-like source (σtestS rc =
σbkgS rc = 0.03 deg). The diﬀerential sensitivity is calcu-
lated for a distance between the two sources of 0.1 deg,
0.3 deg and 0.5 deg (in green, red and blue respectively).
The dashed-black line shows the publicly available sen-
sitivity curve for a point-like source obtained by the
CTA Consortium1. The latest was calculated under the
assumption that the background is caused only by cos-
mic rays, therefore it does not depend on the location of
the test source.

Fig. 15 shows that the sensitivity to detect a point-
like source in the presence of even a moderately strong
source of 0.1 C.U. can be signiﬁcantly (up to an order
of magnitude) worse than in the case of an isolated one.
The eﬀect cannot be ignored in environments densely
populated by gamma-ray sources, as in the case of the

Galactic plane. Since most of the Galactic sources are
extended, in Fig. 16 we show the sensitivities in the re-
gions around an extended gamma-ray source with angu-
lar size 0.2 deg, similar to the average size of the objects
in the Galactic plane [20].

Figure 17: Same as Fig. 15, but for the case of non-Gaussian PSF
with tails given by Eq. [3] with K = 0.3.

The sensitivities shown in Figs. 15 and 16 are ob-
tained under the assumption that the PSF is described
by a pure Gaussian distribution. However, in reality the
PSF might be better represented by a broader distribu-
tion with long tails. In that case, the sensitivity around

Generally, this statement concerns all
energy intervals. However, one should note that the sit-
uation could be more optimistic at multi-TeV energies.
In fact, above 10 TeV (i) the energy resolution becomes
better, (ii) the tails of the PSF are predicted to be more
compact thanks to the higher telescope multiplicity per
event (which would reduce the ﬂuctuations responsible
for the tails), and (iii) a (relatively) small number of
multi-TeV sources (PeVatrons) is expected.

5. Summary

The sensitivity of the current systems of imaging at-
mospheric Cherenkov telescopes is limited by the back-
ground contributed by air showers induced by cosmic
rays. It is expected that the next generation instruments,
such as the CTA observatory, will signiﬁcantly improve
the sensitivity of the current instruments, like H.E.S.S.,
MAGIC and VERITAS. The larger eﬀective area, better
angular resolution, and more eﬀective discrimination of
hadronic showers will contribute to the reduction, by
up to an order of magnitude, of the minimum detectable
ﬂuxes for point-like sources detected by CTA. However,
the improvement of the sensitivity could be more mod-
est if the test source is located in complex environments
densely populated by gamma-ray emitters, due to the
additional background contributed by the gamma-rays
from nearby sources. In this paper, we have quantita-
tively studied this eﬀect under diﬀerent assumptions re-
garding the shape of the PSF. It is demonstrated that for
even a relatively modest background source of strength
∼ 0.1 Crab, the background from a neighboring source
can exceed the cosmic-ray background at distances up
to 0.3 deg or even ∼ 1 deg if the PSF is characterized by
non-negligible tails. Depending on the PSF shape and
the distance to the test source, the minimum detectable
ﬂux is increased by a factor of a few or even by an order
of magnitude. This implies an increase by one to two
orders of magnitude of the required minimum observa-
tion time. This should be taken into account when plan-
ning the observations with future imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov arrays for speciﬁc objects, especially in the
