PARABOLIC BMO AND THE FORWARD-IN-TIME

MAXIMAL OPERATOR

OLLI SAARI

Abstract. We study if the parabolic forward-in-time maximal
operator is bounded on parabolic BMO. It turns out that for non-
negative functions the answer is positive, but the behaviour of sign
changing functions is more delicate. The class parabolic BMO and
the forward-in-time maximal operator originate from the regular-
ity theory of nonlinear parabolic partial diﬀerential equations. In
addition to that context, we also study the question in dimension
one.

1. Introduction

The Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator maps functions of bounded
mean oscillation back to BMO. This is a classical result of Bennett, De-
Vore, and Sharpley [3]. In addition to the original approach, which is
direct, some alternative proofs relying on the properties of the Muck-
enhoupt weights are available in [4, 5].

The present paper is devoted to studying the counterpart of the
boundedness M : BMO → BMO in a context that comes from the
regularity theory of parabolic partial diﬀerential equations [7, 8, 12].
The class parabolic BMO is deﬁned through a condition measuring
mean oscillation in a special way. As opposed to the ordinary BMO
space, a natural time lag appears in connection with parabolic BMO.
It causes several challenges, many of which have only been addressed
very recently; see [10, 14]. Roughly speaking, the positive and negative
parts of the deviation from a constant only satisfy bounds in disjoint
regions of the space time. For a function u of space and time to be in
PBMO+, it suﬃces that

see Section 2.1 for precise deﬁnitions. The condition above leads to
many properties similar to those of the ordinary BMO, but it also
allows for the possibility of arbitrarily fast growth in the negative time

direction. Consequently, the diﬀerence between parabolic BMO and its
classical counterpart is remarkable.

Principal examples of partial diﬀerential equations with connection
to parabolic BMO are the heat equation and its generalizations, most
notably the doubly nonlinear equation

(1.1)

∂(|u|p−2u)

∂t

− div(|∇u|p−2∇u) = 0,

1 < p < ∞.

Logarithms of positive local solutions to (1.1), possibly with measure
data, belong to parabolic BMO [8, 12, 14]. This gives important ex-
amples of PBMO+ functions. A similar relation is also known to hold
for elliptic partial diﬀerential equations and the ordinary BMO. Con-
sequently, the functions in parabolic BMO relate to those in ordinary
BMO in a manner analogous to how supersolutions of the heat equation
relate to those of the Laplace equation.

It was already noted by Moser [12] and Trudinger [15] in the 1960s
that positive supersolutions of (1.1) have their logarithms in a par-
abolic BMO class. This fact is well-known to people working in the
regularity theory of partial diﬀerential equations; see [1, 7, 8]. How-
ever, the literature on parabolic BMO is still limited, and its history can
be recounted quickly. The seminal papers of Moser [12] and Trudinger
[15] established the connection between the partial diﬀerential equa-
tions and parabolic BMO. In addition, the parabolic John-Nirenberg
inequality was proved there. The proof was simpliﬁed in [7] and ex-
tended to spaces of homogeneous type in [1]. Those papers date back
to the 1980s. A method to derive global estimates from the local para-
bolic John-Nirenberg inequality was developed in [14], and it was also
used to answer a question about summability of the supersolutions of
(1.1). This was in 2014. More recent advances in the ﬁeld are coupled
with new trends in the theory of multidimensional one-sided weights;
see [6, 10, 9, 13]. The techniques relevant in that context combine
argumentation typical to the one-dimensional one-sided weight theory

•R−(γ)R+(γ)(x,τ)RtPARABOLIC BMO AND THE MAXIMAL OPERATOR

to that of harmonic and geometric analysis of partial diﬀerential equa-
tions. The usual challenge is to ﬁnd a way to compensate the loss of
many important tools such as the Besicovitch covering lemma and the
standard maximal function techniques.

Recall that the known results on parabolic BMO include a John–
Nirenberg type inequality [1, 12], a Coifman-Rochberg type characteri-
zation through a special theory of weights [10], and geometric local-to-
global properties [14]. The contribution of this paper is to show that
the same operator of forward-in-time maximal averages (see Section 2
and Figure 1)

(cid:90)

M γ+f (x) = sup

(cid:96)>0 −

R+(z,(cid:96),γ)|f|

that generates the parabolic weight theory also maps the class of pos-
itive functions in parabolic BMO into itself. The boundedness of the
parabolic forward-in-time maximal operator is consistent with the “el-
liptic” result in [3] when only positive functions are involved. Namely,
the results coincide if we restrict our attention to functions with no
time-dependency. In the time-dependent case, Theorem 4.3 is far more
general. On the other hand, if we allow the functions under study to be
sign-changing, a full analogue of the Bennett-DeVore-Sharpley result
will be false in the parabolic context. Hence there are indigenously
parabolic phenomena involved in our result. See Theorem 4.3 and the
related discussion for more precise statements.

We conclude the introduction by brieﬂy describing the structure of
the present paper. It is divided into three main sections and an addi-
tional section discussing the one-dimensional analogue of the problem
under study. Section 2 is used to set up the notation and to intro-
duce the operators and the function classes we study. In Section 3, we
prove several auxiliary results such as a chain argument, and we also
construct a special dyadic grid. These results are needed to solve prob-
lems that arise from the time-dependent nature of the main theorems.
Once all the preparations have been carried out, we prove the main
theorems, namely Lemma 4.1 asserting the boundedness of

M γ+ : PBMO+

positive −→ PBMO+

positive

and Theorem 4.3 reﬁning the result. At the end of the paper, we show
how a simpliﬁed argument can be used the prove a slightly stronger
result in dimension one. This is in the context of one-sided BMO
spaces of Mart´ın-Reyes and de la Torre [11]. To our best knowledge,
also the one-dimensional result is new.

2. Notation and definitions

We use standard notation. We mostly work in Rn+1 with the last
coordinate called time, the ﬁrst ones space. The results also hold in
space time cylinders that are sets of the form Ω × R with Ω ⊂ Rn a
bounded domain. The notation A (cid:46) B means that there is an un-
interesting constant C such that A ≤ CB. We do not keep track of
dependencies on dimension n, the growth type of the equation p or
parameters coming from the domain of deﬁnition Ω. It is clear what
(cid:38) and (cid:104) mean.

For a measurable (we always assume it tacitly) set E we denote by
|E| its n + 1 dimensional Lebesgue measure. For the integral average,
we have the standard notation

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

E

|E|
For a (measurable) function f , we denote

fE = −

f =

f.

E

f + = f+ = f 1{f >0}

and f− = f− = −f 1{f <0}.

The function 1E equals 1 in E and zero elsewhere.

We continue by introducing the notation for parabolic rectangles.
Let p > 1 be a number that is ﬁxed throughout the paper. In appli-
cations, it would be the p coming from the p-Laplace operator. For
evolutionary problems, it has an important role in determining how
the time variable and the space variables scale.

If Q ⊂ Rn is a cube with sides parallel to coordinate axes, we denote
In previous
its side length by (cid:96)(Q). Take a parameter γ ∈ (0, 1).
papers, this has been called the lag, but here the name shape would be
better. We specify a parabolic rectangle together with its upper and
lower parts by its center (x, t), side length (cid:96)(Q), and shape parameter
γ. We usually drop some or all of the parameters from the notation,
but if they are present, they should be understood as follows (see also
Figure 1):

R((x, t), (cid:96)(Q), γ) = Q × (t − (cid:96)(Q)p, t + (cid:96)(Q)p)

R−(γ) = Q × (t − (cid:96)(Q)p, t − (1 − γ))(cid:96)(Q)p)
R+(γ) = Q × (t + (1 − γ)(cid:96)(Q)p, t + (cid:96)(Q)p).

The number (cid:96)(R) := (cid:96)(Q) is called the side length of the rectangle.
Addition of a constant to a set in Rn+1 is always understood as adding
the constant to the time coordinate.

2.1. Classes of BMO type. We say that u ∈ PBMO− if each para-

bolic rectangle R has a constant aR such that

This is not a norm in the precise meaning of the word, but we call it a
norm. PBMO− is not a vector space, but we call it a space. Moreover,
we say that an operator T is bounded on PBMO− if (cid:107)T u(cid:107)PBMO− ≤
C(cid:107)u(cid:107)PBMO− even if the set up is not the one of normed linear spaces.
The methods developed in the previous works show that given shape
γ and lag coeﬃcient L > (1 − γ), there are constants {bR}R such that

Suitable references for this are [9, 14], and the idea of the proof is
also contained in the Lemma 3.3 proved in this paper. That lemma is
intended to be an easy reference for the numerous applications of the
chain argument that we need.
It has been observed already earlier that PBMO− can be realized
as an intersection of two even rougher function classes. We mention
[9] as a reference for the multidimensional case.
In dimension one,
this claim does not make so much sense because the “rough” function
classes turn out to coincide and equal to PBMO−. See [11]. However,
when it comes to so called one-sided L∞ functions, similar things also
happen in dimension one [2]. Let

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

(u − uR−(γ)+L(cid:96)(R)p)+ < ∞
(uR−(γ) − u)+ < ∞.

(cid:107)−u(cid:107)BMO−(γ,L) := sup

R−(γ)+L(cid:96)(R)p

The ﬁrst inequality is called BMO+ condition and the second one

− BMO− condition. Note that BMO− would just be BMO+ with t-
axis of the coordinate space reversed. This notational convention on
the direction of time also holds for PBMO± and the maximal functions
that we use. The one sided function classes BMO± are not known to
be independent of γ or L. However, they are useful because of the
following:

(2.1)

PBMO− = [BMO+(γ1, L1)] ∩ [− BMO−(γ2, L2)]

for any choice of the shape and lag parameters. For details about
this, see [9] and the discussion preceding the point to which we have
advanced.
PBMO− is closed under addition and multiplication by positive con-
stants. Multiplication by negative constants reverses the direction of
time, that is, it maps PBMO− to PBMO+. For one-sided spaces BMO±
proving or disproving the previously mentioned property is an open
problem.

We conclude this section by recalling the parabolic John-Nirenberg
inequality. This appears in the literature, and it is proved in [1] whereas
its formulation in diﬀerent geometric conﬁgurations is studied in [14].

2.2. Parabolic maximal function. The ﬁrst candidate to be a par-
abolic backward-in-time maximal operator was introduced in [10], and
it reads as

M γ−f (x) = sup

R(x)−

R−(γ)|f|.

The supremum is over parabolic rectangles centred at x and we average
the absolute value over the left part. See also Figure 2. This deﬁnition
is problematic when dealing PBMO− functions that are not necessarily
positive. Too many of them are mapped to inﬁnity. For the positive
functions, however, it coincides with the following maximal function.

We let

M γ−

∗ f (x) := sup

(cid:19)

where the supremum is over all the parabolic rectangles that are cen-
tred at x. This maximal function measures positivity in the past, neg-
ativity in the future. In case the time variable is trivial, that is, we
have functions on Rn as in the study of elliptic PDE or as in the
classical Calder´on-Zygmund theory, it coincides with the usual Hardy-
Littlewood maximal function.

There are, however, delicate issues involved in the behaviour of pos-
itive and negative parts of the functions, multiplications by negative

numbers, and taking absolute values in the parabolic theory. Recall

for instance the problem of − BMO−, and see Remark 3.2. In connec-
tion with PBMO−, we have that PBMO− = − PBMO+. The maximal
function above is designed to have the same property while maintaining
the consistency with the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function.
Namely, M γ−
∗ (−f ) = M γ+∗ f . Note also that this maximal function has
its natural sharp version that can be used to deﬁne PBMO−.

3. Preliminary results

This section contains the proofs of some lemmas that we need. In
many occasions, we have to decompose functions in PBMO− into posi-
tive and negative parts, and we next prove that this procedure respects
the PBMO− property. The subsequent subsection contains a chain
lemma, and the remaining two contain a construction of a dyadic grid
suitable for our purposes and some remarks on the local integrability
of maximal functions of functions in PBMO−.
3.1. Truncations. We start with noting that PBMO± classes are sta-
ble with respect to truncation. Even if this property looks very elemen-
tary, its proof still diﬀers a bit from the classical analogue. Namely,
we really need the equivalence with respect to lag and shape in order
to get the conclusion.

Proposition 3.1. Let u ∈ PBMO−. Then u+,−u−

Q++ = R+(γ) + (0, . . . , 0, (1 + γ)(cid:96)(R)p).

Then it is easy to see that for every point in Q++ we have that

((u+)Q − u+)+ ≤ ([(u − uQ+)+]Q + (uQ+)+ − u+)+

and averaging over the domain Q++ completes the proof for u+. See
Remark 3.4 for the fact that the increased gap between Q and Q++
does not matter.

For the negative part, we note that −u ∈ PBMO+ and by the previ-
ous step also (−u)+ ∈ PBMO+. Then −u− = −(−u+) ∈ − PBMO+ =
(cid:3)
PBMO−.
Remark 3.2. The previous proposition does not say anything about
absolute values of PBMO− functions. Indeed, PBMO− is not closed
under subtraction. In general, absolute values may fail to belong to
PBMO−. An easy one dimensional example is et−e−t. As an increasing
function it trivially satisﬁes PBMO− condition. However, taking an
absolute value converts it into a rapidly decreasing function as we go
towards −∞.
3.2. Chain argument. The following lemma is what we refer to as
the chain argument. It is very important. The formulation and the
proof simplify the arguments that were used in [14] a lot, and we hope
that writing this argument down in a readable way is of independent
interest. Moreover, as a corollary of this lemma, we can also easily
deduce the independence of shape and lag of the deﬁnition of PBMO−
which we often refer to.
Lemma 3.3. Let u ∈ PBMO−. Consider a rectangle R−(θ) with spa-
tial side length (cid:96). Let v ∈ Rn and τ > (1 − θ). Deﬁne

P +(θ) = R−(θ) + (v, τ (cid:96)p).

vances, up to a constant factor, the amount |v|(cid:96)p/(cid:96) = |v|(cid:96)p−1 in time.

By our assumption on τ being large, we can ﬁnd δ such that

In this estimate, the quantities l, k, δ depend only on |v|/(cid:96), τ , n, p and

To get rid of the restriction of τ being a large number, we do the

John-Nirenberg inequality of PBMO−, Lemma 2.1. This is quite a

This form is particularly convenient when working with u ∈ PBMO−.

We want the pieces to have supports with controlled overlap, and ob-
taining that property in the geometry where the time variable scales
as space to power p requires some work.

For an eﬀective use of the Calder´on-Zygmund stopping time argu-
ment, it is beneﬁcial to dispose of a dyadic grid. The existence of such
a grid is nontrivial in the parabolic geometry if we want to maintain
an intuition of how our dyadic parabolic rectangles look like. This in-
tuition is lost when using the black boxes that would be available from
the analysis in metric spaces.

The main problem in the dyadic grid is that if the number p governing
the geometry is an irrational number, then we cannot simply subdivide
a box to 2n cubes in space and 2p boxes in the space since the latter
number is not an integer. This problem is easy to circumvent if p is
rational, but in case of irrational p one has to resort to an approximative
construction.

Lemma 3.6. Let Q0 be a half of a parabolic rectangle with side length
(cid:96)(Q0). Then there exists boxes with the properties of the dyadic tree
that are almost parabolic sub-rectangles of Q0:

is a unique (cid:98)Q ∈ Di−1 with (cid:98)Q ⊃ Q. In addition, |Q| (cid:104) |(cid:98)Q|.
(ii) If P, Q ∈ D, then P ∩ Q ∈ {∅, P, Q}. For each Q ∈ Di, there
(iii) Every Q ∈ Di almost has the dimensions ((cid:96), (cid:96)p). Namely,
there is a parabolic box ˜Q obtained from Q0 by means of para-
bolic dilation (x, t) (cid:55)→ (δx, δpt) and translation so that (cid:96)( ˜Q) =
2−i(cid:96)(Q0), ˜Q ⊃ Q, and | ˜Q| (cid:104) |Q|

Proof. For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we may assume
that Q0 = [0, 1]n+1. For every p > 1, it is easy to see that there exists
a non-decreasing sequence of integers ki such that for i ∈ Z+

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p −

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

ki

.

We denote qi = ki/i.

At step one, we divide the spatial side length of Q0 by 2 and the
temporal one by 2k1. These dimensions give us space time boxes in
the geometry where time scales as space to power q1. We use them to
partition Q0. This gives the collection D1 that serves as a generation
in the dyadic grid we are constructing.

At the second step, we keep repeating the process so that boxes in
Di−1 have their spatial side length halved so that we reach the desired
side length 2−i. The previous side length was 21−i. We choose the tem-
poral side length to be 2−ki. Note that this is obtained by repeatedly
multiplying 2−ki−1 by 2−1 (possibly zero times) since the sequence ki
is increasing. With these dimensions, we get space time boxes in the
geometry where time scales as the space to power qi. We use these
blocks to partition boxes in Di−1. Their collection is called Di.
Finally note that if Q ∈ Di, and ˜Q is a block with the same spatial

side length that respects the geometry where time scales as space to
power p, then

2−ki
2−pi = 2pi−ki ∈ (2−1, 2).

Hence we have good control over the distortion of the geometry at
all scales. Consequently, we may always cover the dyadic box with a
proper parabolic rectangle so that the error in volume is controlled. (cid:3)
3.4. Integrability of maximal functions. The functions in PBMO−
are locally integrable. In spatially unbounded domains the maximal
functions may easily fail this property so some care must be taken.
One suitable criterion for local integrability of maximal function of a
PBMO− function is given by its ﬁniteness.

Lemma 3.7.

(i) Let u ∈ PBMO−(Ω) where Ω ⊂ Rn+1 is a space

time cylinder. Then M γ−

∗ u ∈ L1

loc(Ω).

PARABOLIC BMO AND THE MAXIMAL OPERATOR

(ii) Let u ∈ PBMO−(Rn+1). If there are x1, x2 ∈ Rn and numbers

t2 > t1 such that

M γ−u+(x2, t2) < ∞ and
M γ+u−(x1, t1) < ∞,
loc({(y, τ ) ∈ Rn+1 : t1 < τ < t2}).

then

M γ−
∗ u ∈ L1

Proof. (i) For the case of the space time cylinder, choose any rectangle
R ⊂ Ω. We may apply the John-Nirenberg from [14] to get exponential
integrability for u± in the union of the rectangles that the maximal
function sees from there. This is enough to show that the maximal
function has to be locally integrable.

(ii) In the case where u is deﬁned on Rn+1, some more analysis is
needed. Assume ﬁrst that u ≥ 0. We may restrict our attention to a
maximal operator that only sees large rectangles since the case of small
rectangles is the same as the case of a space time cylinder. If we write
U = max{U1, U2} where U is the maximal function, U1 is the small-
rectangle-supremum, and U2 is the supremum over large rectangles,
we see that for all parabolic rectangles R located in the half-space

{(y, τ ) ∈ Rn+1 : τ < t2} we have that

(cid:90)

−
R−(γ)

U2 (cid:46)R,n,p,(cid:107)u(cid:107)PBMO− U (x, t) < ∞

by the argument in Section 4.1. Hence we get that M γ−
∗ u is locally
integrable in the half-space. In case we have a general u = u+ − u−,
we may do the previous estimation for the positive and negative parts
(cid:3)
separately.

4. Parabolic BMO and maximal functions

Next we study the boundedness of the parabolic maximal operator
on parabolic BMO space. This is inspired by a result in Bennett,
DeVore, and Sharpley [3].
Indeed, under the positivity assumption,
the following lemma generalizes their result. The case of more general
functions is discussed after the proof of this lemma.
We do not distinguish the cases where the domain of deﬁnition of
PBMO− functions is a space time cylinder or a full space. The only
diﬀerence between these cases is in integrability issues of the maximal
function. In what follows, we assume the local integrability of M γ−
∗ u,
and criteria for this condition in the two diﬀerent cases can be found
in Lemma 3.7.

Lemma 4.1. Let u ∈ PBMO− be such that u ≥ 0 almost everywhere.
Then M γ−u = M γ−

∗ u ∈ PBMO− and

provided that M γ−
Proof. Let u ≥ 0 be in PBMO−. We start by proving that M γ−
∗ u ∈
BMO+. Let R0 be an arbitrary parabolic rectangle. We will use the
following notation:
U (x) = M γ−
U1(x) = sup{uR−(γ) : x is the center of R, (cid:96)(R) ≤ 100−1(cid:96)(R0)}
U2(x) = sup{uR−(γ) : x is the center of R, (cid:96)(R) ≤ 100−1(cid:96)(R0)}.

∗ u(x)

Note that U (x) = max{U1(x), U2(x)}. We may choose the conﬁgura-
tion in which we attempt to bound the PBMO− norm type quantities.
This is due to Lemma 3.3. We let R−

The proof works for a much more general expression, but in order to
emphasize the structure of the proof, we try to avoid excessive techni-
calities. We start the proof with the case of U2.

4.1. Large rectangles. Take a point x ∈ R−
0 and any rectangle R
that is admissible in the deﬁnition of U2, that is, x is the center of
R and (cid:96)(R) ≥ 100−1(cid:96)(R0). We denote by A the number satisfying

(cid:96)(R) = A(cid:96)(R0)

Take a point z from R+ and a rectangle P centered at z with

uP −(γ) ≤ M γ−

∗ u(z)

such that it has large enough side length B(cid:96)(R0). The constant B will
be ﬁxed later. It has to have the correct relations to the constant A.
Next we look at how close the rectangles R−(γ) and P −(γ) are to

each other. Let

Note that since

τ− = sup{t : (x, t) ∈ R−(γ)}
τ + = inf{t : (x, t) ∈ P −(γ)}.
τ + − τ−

4.2. Small rectangles I: Calder´on-Zygmund. In this part, we use

the dyadic grid constructed in Lemma 3.6. The cases with p ∈ Q and
p /∈ Q are not very diﬀerent since the fact that the dyadic grid only

approximates the real one only comes into the picture in few occasions.
In order to keep the notation more simple, we work on the case with
rational p, and comment the corrections that should be done with ap-
proximate dyadic grid. This saves us from some additional indices.
Before attacking our target rectangle R0, we make some preparations.

by symmetry. The third item is obvious by the previous ones.

Functions of the type et−e−t on R show that the third item is almost
the best one may hope for. The method of the proof of Lemma 4.1 does
not seem to give a better result than the one above. However, already
the maximal function belonging to the sum space PBMO− + PBMO+
would look very much like the classical BMO → BMO result for the
Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. On the other hand, a function
u ∈ BMO(Rn) satisﬁes u ∈ PBMO+ ∩ PBMO− and M±
∗ u = M in the
time-independent case so the well-known stationary result is covered
by our evolutionary theorem.

this setting, a statement corresponding to Lemma 4.1 is much easier
to prove, but we point out that the correct claim cannot be deduced
directly from the multidimensional result.

In dimension one, the relevant maximal function of u ≥ 0 is usually

deﬁned as

and there is no gap between the evaluation point x and the domain of
integration (x−h, x). It is a general phenomenon that expressions that
have a gap in the parabolic context seldom have it in dimension one. It
is also usual that the gap is qualitatively inessential in dimension one
whereas it is only quantitatively inessential in the parabolic context.

We refer to [9] and [11] for more precise discussion on what is the role
of the gap in the theory of one-sided maximal functions, weights, and
BMO.

As it were, a direct application of Lemma 4.1 does not give the
optimal result in the one-dimensional context of [11]. In order to ease
the task of the reader only interested in the one-dimensional case, we
give a proof of the correct one-dimensional version of Lemma 4.1. The
exposition of this proof is intended to be independent of all the other
sections of this paper.

We start by recalling the deﬁnitions from [11]. We say that u ∈

BMO+(R) if

(cid:107)u(cid:107)∗ := sup

The supremum is over all intervals, and I + = I + |I|. This number is
comparable to

(cid:90)

|I|

as one can deduce from the theorems 2 and 3 in [11]. Finally, remember
the deﬁnition of the one-sided maximal function given in the beginning
of this section.

Theorem 5.1. Let u ∈ BMO+(R) be positive. If U is locally integrable,

then

Proof. Take u ≥ 0 from BMO+(R). Let I be an interval. We note that

U = max(U1, U2) where

(cid:107)U(cid:107)∗ ≤ C(cid:107)u(cid:107)∗

U1(x) = sup{u(x−h,x) : h ≤ |I|}
U2(x) = sup{u(x−h,x) : h ≥ |I|}.

Large h. We start by estimating (U2(x) − UI +)+ where I + = I + |I|,
and x ∈ I. Take any h ≥ |I|. Choose any y ∈ I +. Suppose that
x ≤ y − h. Then

since y − x ≤ 2|I| ≤ 2h.
In the complementary situation x > y − h, let k be the positive
integer such that x − k(y − x) ∈ [x − h, y − h]. The proof of the claim
proceeds through an iterative algorithm which either stops after hitting
the case k = 1 or converges asymptotically.
