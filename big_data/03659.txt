ABSTRACT

The dynamo action achieved in the convective cores of main-sequence massive stars is explored here through
3-D global simulations of convective core dynamos operating within a young 10M(cid:12) B-type star, using the
anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code. These simulations capture the inner 65% of this star by radius, en-
compassing the convective nuclear-burning core (about 23% by radius) and a portion of the overlying radiative
envelope. Eight rotation rates are considered, ranging from 0.05% to 16% of the surface breakup velocity,
thereby capturing both convection barely sensing the effects of rotation to others in which the Coriolis forces
are prominent. The vigorous dynamo action realized within all of these turbulent convective cores builds mag-
netic ﬁelds with peak strengths exceeding a megagauss, with the overall magnetic energy (ME) in the faster
rotators reaching super-equipartition levels compared to the convective kinetic energy (KE). The core con-
vection typically involves turbulent columnar velocity structures roughly aligned with the rotation axis, with
magnetic ﬁelds threading through these rolls and possessing complex linkages throughout the core. The very
strong ﬁelds are able to coexist with the ﬂows without quenching them through Lorentz forces. The velocity and
magnetic ﬁelds achieve such a state by being nearly co-aligned, and with peak magnetic islands being some-
what displaced from the fastest ﬂows as the intricate evolution proceeds. As the rotation rate is increased, the
primary force balance shifts from nonlinear advection balancing Lorentz forces to a magnetostrophic balance
between Coriolis and Lorentz forces.

1. INTRODUCTION

The massive O and B stars are the great recyclers in galax-
ies, with their short lives, strong winds, and possible super-
nova endings dominating the dispersal of the products of nu-
clear burning. The ultimate fate of such stars depends upon
how much mass is lost through radiatively driven winds in
the course of their evolution, and this is likely inﬂuenced by
both rotation and magnetism. If their initial masses exceed
about 8M(cid:12), they have the potential to end their lives as core-
collapse supernovae, leaving behind a neutron star or black
hole as a central remnant, in addition to the material that is
processed and expelled (e.g., Woosley et al. 2002; Heger et al.
2003; Langer 2012). Thus the term massive star is used to
distinguish them from stars of lesser mass that likely end as
white dwarfs. Much is unknown about the dynamics occur-
ring within the interiors of these stars. During their main-
sequence lifetime, there is a convective core deep within a
massive star and thin convective shells near the surface with a
large radiative envelope between them. Yet how these regions
interact through instabilities, convective driving, and mag-
netic linkage remains largely unclear. Aspects of this question
are addressed here with global-scale 3-D simulations. These
simulations examine the turbulent convection and sustained
magnetic dynamo action within the core of main-sequence B-
type stars of various rotation rates. The gravity waves that the
convection excites in the radiative envelope are also captured
within the same simulated domain.

As a massive B-type star, a 10M(cid:12) ZAMS star with solar
metallicity has a radius of about 4R(cid:12) and a luminosity of
about 5700L(cid:12) based on a MESA model (e.g., Paxton et al.
2011). This energy output drives fast, mass-laden winds and
ultraviolet radiation from their photospheres, which strongly

kyle.augustson@cea.fr

inﬂuences their surroundings (e.g., Kudritzki & Puls 2000;
Ud-Doula et al. 2009; Owocki 2011; Walder et al. 2012). With
a central temperature of 31.2 MK and density of 8.8 g cm−3
in such a star, the CNO-cycle dominated fusion in the core
rapidly consumes hydrogen, leading to a main sequence life-
time of only 21 million years. The resulting large luminos-
ity is carried outward by a combination of radiation and con-
vective motions, with the vigorous convection occurring in a
nearly-spherical core that occupies about half of the star by
mass and 23% by radius. The convective transport accounts
for about half of the total luminosity within the core. The
convective ﬂows are expected to be extremely turbulent and
hence are inherently time-dependent and three-dimensional.
Beyond modifying the structure of the core itself, this convec-
tion also inﬂuences the dynamics of the radiative zone above
it and may impact the surface properties of the star through
three primary mechanisms: convective overshooting and exci-
tation of gravity waves, rotational mixing processes, and mag-
netic linkages (e.g., Claret 2007; Brott et al. 2011; Maeder &
Meynet 2012).

1.1. Observed Rotation and Magnetism

Observations using spectral line widths have shown that the
majority of main sequence B-type stars are fairly rapid rota-
tors (Abt et al. 2002). The average projected equatorial veloc-
ity of these stars is about 140kms−1 on the main sequence, but
have a large standard deviation. Indeed, observations of sin-
gle stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and also in ﬁeld stars
yield a wide range of rotational velocities, between very slow
rotation to about 70% of the breakup speed (e.g., Keller 2004;
Hunter et al. 2008). More recent Doppler measurements using
Fourier transforms of spectral lines have shown that for a well
selected sample population there is a bimodal distribution of
projected rotational velocity (Dufton et al. 2013). This sug-

2

Augustson et al.

gests that there are two populations of main sequence B-type
stars, a more rapidly rotating one with an average rotational
velocity of about 180kms−1 and another peaking at 20kms−1
or less. It has been suggested that the stars in this latter pop-
ulation may possess magnetic ﬁelds that have acted to spin
them down through their winds.

The rotation rates of the core and radiative envelope of
some B stars, notably β-Cepheid variables, have been esti-
mated using asteroseismic means but no deﬁnite trends have
emerged. All are slow rotators, with (Aerts et al. 2003) rul-
ing out rigid rotation for a B3V star, with (Pamyatnykh et al.
2004) ﬁnding that the core interface may be rotating three
times faster than the envelope of ν Eridani, and (Briquet et al.
2007) for the B2 star θ Ophiuchi favoring rigid rotation. Re-
cent access to a larger set of gravity mode splittings using Ke-
pler data for a slowly pulsating B8V star suggest nearly rigid
rotation of core and envelope (Andrés Triana et al. 2015). The
very small angular velocity contrasts for three of the B stars
call for effective angular momentum coupling, possibly by
gravity waves or magnetic ﬁelds during their evolution.

Recent observational surveys by consortia such as MiMeS
(Magnetism in Massive Stars) and BOB (B Fields in OB
Stars) have been directed toward measuring magnetic ﬁelds
on the surfaces of massive stars, some using spectropolari-
metric Zeeman Doppler Imaging techniques. They report
that only about 7% of B-type stars exhibit large-scale mag-
netic ﬁelds (e.g., Donati & Landstreet 2009; Wade et al. 2011;
Grunhut et al. 2012; Morel et al. 2014). There is also indirect
evidence that a larger fraction may possess magnetic ﬁelds,
but that they may be too weak or of too small a spatial scale
to be detected using spectropolarimetry. What remains largely
unknown is how these magnetic ﬁelds arise. Four comple-
mentary theories that attempt to address the origins of these
magnetic ﬁelds are: a strong core dynamo (Moss 1989; Char-
bonneau & MacGregor 2001; Brun et al. 2005); a shear-driven
dynamo in the radiative zone (Spruit 2002; Mullan & Mac-
Donald 2005); a fossil ﬁeld surviving from the star’s forma-
tion stages (Braithwaite & Nordlund 2006); or a bifurcation in
the stability of weak and strong magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations
in differentially rotating envelopes (Aurière et al. 2007; Lig-
nières et al. 2014). Some of the implications of such differing
origins for the observed surface magnetic ﬁelds are discussed
in Donati & Landstreet (2009) and Langer (2012).

1.2. Simulating Massive Stars

For this paper, a series of spherical 3-D magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD) simulations was carried out to examine the
properties of the magnetic ﬁelds that might be realized within
the convective core of rotating main-sequence 10M(cid:12) B-type
stars. These simulations build upon earlier studies using the
anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code to study convective
core dynamos in rotating 2M(cid:12) A-type stars (Brun et al. 2005;
Featherstone et al. 2009), suggesting the general ﬂavor of the
structures and strengths of magnetic ﬁelds that may be built
in B-type stars. However, the convection within the cores
of the more massive B-stars is much more vigorous, where
the average convective velocities are ten times those seen in
a typical A-type star (Browning et al. 2004). Therefore the
ﬁeld strengths and ﬂow structures maintained within the core
of these stars remain uncertain given the nonlinearity of the
underlying physics.

Notable ﬁndings from the A star simulations are that super-
equipartition dynamo states could be realized in which the
magnetic energy is signiﬁcantly greater than the convective

kinetic energy, and that little differential rotation survived
within the core in the presence of such magnetic ﬁelds. In
Featherstone et al. (2009) a core-fossil ﬁeld system was con-
structed by introducing various fossil ﬁeld conﬁgurations into
the radiative envelope surrounding the core dynamo. The
interaction between the existing dynamo and a modest fos-
sil ﬁeld possessing a net ﬂux through the core has allowed
the system to generate signiﬁcantly greater (roughly tenfold)
magnetic energy than kinetic energy, as might be expected
from theory in other settings (Boyer & Levy 1984; Sarson
et al. 1999). Such behavior is in stark contrast to simula-
tions in the absence of a fossil ﬁeld where these stars gen-
erated magnetic energies that were only 70% of the convec-
tive kinetic energy (Brun et al. 2005). Peak ﬁeld strengths in
the super-equipartition states reach as high as 500 kG. Such
structures in A star cores may ultimately become buoyant and
attempt to rise to the stellar surface.

The dynamo action in the cores of massive B stars may
yield magnetic ﬁelds that are strong enough to be capable
of buoyantly rising to the surface before thermalizing. How-
ever, the buoyant structures must overcome the compositional
gradients and stiff stratiﬁcation present at the core boundary
(MacDonald & Mullan 2004). One mechanism that partially
circumvents this constraint, by reducing the magnetic ﬁeld
strength required to buoyantly rise to the surface, is convec-
tive overshooting and penetration into the stably stratiﬁed en-
velope above the core. This leads to mixing in this region,
which reduces the compositional and sub-adiabatic gradients
there. It also deposits magnetic ﬁeld above the steepest gradi-
ents, where the ﬁeld may be strengthened through shearing by
the differential rotation. This ﬁeld may grow to strengths to
become sufﬁciently buoyant to survive radiative exchange as
they rise to the surface. Thus the core dynamo might have di-
rect bearing on the regions of strong magnetic ﬁeld observed
on the surfaces of some massive stars. However, it may well
be that what is detected are fossil ﬁelds from the formation
stages of the massive stars, and many favor this simpler sug-
gestion rather than calling for contemporary dynamo action to
explain the magnetic ﬁelds detected in a small fraction of B
stars.

Simulations of 3-D core convection without magnetism in
massive stars were ﬁrst reported by Kuhlen et al. (2003) for
a 15M(cid:12) main-sequence B star, and recently for a similar star
by Gilet et al. (2013) using low Mach number modeling, re-
vealing the complexity of the resulting ﬂows. Using a fully
compressible code, Meakin & Arnett (2007) examined the
differences in 2-D and 3-D modeling of core convection in
a nonrotating 23M(cid:12) main-sequence O star, emphasizing that
3-D convective ﬂows are dominated by small plumes and ed-
dies unlike the more laminar 2-D ﬂows. Angular momentum
transport by internal gravity waves generated at the convec-
tive core and radiative envelope interface in a 3M(cid:12) star have
been investigated by Rogers et al. (2013) in a 2-D equatorial
domain for a range of rotation rates, ﬁnding that the waves
can be effective in doing so if strongly forced.

This paper has the following structure: §2 provides a sim-
ple scaling argument for how the core magnetic ﬁeld strength
may be inﬂuenced by rotation as measured by a Rossby num-
ber. §3 presents the MHD equations as solved in ASH and
how the numerical experiments are formulated. §5 contrasts
the convective patterns and mean ﬂows realized in a hydrody-
namic model with those in a companion MHD simulation. §6
summarizes the properties of the MHD simulations for vary-
ing rotation rates (and thus Rossby number). §7 examines in

ation. §8 analyzes the properties of the ﬂows and magnetic
ﬁeld structuring that admits the remarkable existence of su-
perequipartition states. §9 reﬂects upon the signiﬁcance of
our core dynamo solutions.

2. SCALING OF MAGNETIC AND KINETIC ENERGIES
In considering the magnetic ﬁeld that can be achieved in
the core of massive stars, it is useful to assess the dynamical
balances that may arise in such rotating and convective sys-
tems. A relatively simple force balance involves the Lorentz
and inertial force in a weakly rotating system that yields mag-
netic ﬁeld strength in equipartition with the kinetic energy
contained in the convection, such as

ρv·∇v ≈ 1
4π

∇× B× B,

with v the velocity, B the magnetic ﬁeld and ρ the density.
Suppose that the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld vary with the length
scale L. Therefore, the average gradients yield an equiparti-
tion magnetic ﬁeld of order

eq ≈ 4πρv2.

Since most of the B-type stars are rotating fairly rapidly,
the core dynamo may reach a magnetostrophic state where
the Coriolis force play a key role in balancing the Lorentz
force as discussed generally in (Christensen 2010; Brun et al.
2015). First, consider that there are other forces at work in
this system: pressure, buoyancy and diffusive forces. If it is
assumed that some fraction (1 − β, for 0 < β < 1) of the iner-
tial force counter-balances those three forces, then one arrives
at a modiﬁed force balance

with Ω0 = Ω0ˆez, the rotation rate of the reference frame and
with Ro the Rossby number.

The basic point is that the ratio of the total magnetic energy
to the kinetic energy depends upon the degree of the rotational
constraint of the convection and upon the intrinsic ability of
the convection to generate a sustained dynamo. This can be
characterized as above in Equation 6, where that ratio depends
upon the the inverse Rossby number and the magnitude of the
magnetic ﬁeld established in a nonrotating convective core.
This scaling with and without the inertial term is shown in
Figure 1.
In that ﬁgure, the blue curve is given by Equa-
tion 6 with β = 0.5, whereas the green curve corresponds to
β = 0 and leads to the scaling ME/KE ≈ Ro−1. This shows
that the inertial term gives rise to a minimum magnetic en-
ergy state. It further demonstrates that for large rotation rates
the core dynamo is expected to reach superequipartition states
with ME/KE > 1, with the possibility of achieving states with
this ratio much greater than unity. The concurrence between
the measured values from the simulations and those from the
above scaling relationship is examined in §6.

3. FORMULATING THE PROBLEM

The research tool employed here for modeling dynamics
within stellar interiors is the 3-D anelastic spherical harmonic
(ASH) simulation code. ASH is a global large-eddy simula-
tion (LES) code that solves the anelastic MHD equations of
motion in a rotating spherical shell using a pseudo-spectral
method (Brun et al. 2004). Simulations using ASH capture
the entire spherical shell geometry and allows for global con-
nectivity of magnetic structures and turbulent ﬂows. ASH
employs spherical harmonic expansions Y m
(cid:96) (θ, φ) in the hor-
izontal directions of the entropy, magnetic ﬁelds, pressure
and mass ﬂux, and fourth-order nonuniform ﬁnite differences
in the radial direction to resolve the radial derivatives. The
soleidonality of the mass ﬂux and magnetic vector ﬁelds is
achieved through a streamfunction formalism. The spherical

harmonic expansion is truncated at degree (cid:96)max, with all az-
imuthal orders m retained in the triangular truncation, thus
yielding uniform resolution over spherical surfaces. For all
the simulation here, (cid:96)max = 340, corresponding to 512 mesh
points in the latitudinal direction (Nθ), with the longitudinal
mesh having Nφ = 2Nθ or 1024 mesh points, and in radius
Nr = 500 mesh points. The time evolution is computed using
a semi-implicit second-order Crank-Nicolson scheme for the
linear terms and an explicit second-order Adams-Bashforth
scheme for the advective, Coriolis and Lorentz terms. The
substantial computational demands for the extended evolution
required to study core dynamos are met with ASH optimized
to run very efﬁciently on massively parallel supercomputers.
ASH simulations cannot capture all of the very wide spec-
trum of scales of motion and magnetic ﬁelds expected in the
highly turbulent cores. Thus the unresolved sub-grid-scale
dynamics is parameterized as effective momentum, thermal,
and magnetic diffusivities. Further, the anelastic approxima-
tion is employed to retain stratiﬁcation effects and Alfvén
waves, while ﬁltering out sound waves which have short peri-
ods relative to the dynamical time scales of most interest. For
B-type stars, the sound speed in the core is on the order of
1000kms−1, while the convective ﬂows are about 0.5kms−1.
Thus the anelastic approximation is ideally suited for simulat-
ing the interior of these stars. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition on the time step thus depends either on the local
subsonic ﬂow velocity, the speed of Alfvén waves or resolv-
ing the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, rather than the local speed
of sound.

The version of the ASH code utilized here implements
the Lantz-Braginsky-Roberts (LBR) co-density formulation
(Lantz 1992; Braginsky & Roberts 1995), so that gravity
waves are properly captured in the stably stratiﬁed, radiative
envelope (Brown et al. 2012). The anelastic MHD equations
evolved in ASH are still fully nonlinear in the momentum and
magnetic variables (Brun et al. 2004). The thermodynamic
variables of entropy, pressure, temperature and density (S, P,
T , and ρ) are linearized about a spherically-symmetric and hy-
drostatic background state S, P, T , and ρ, which are functions
of the radial coordinate only. The equation of state for this
background state is a calorically perfect gas. The equations
solved in ASH retain physical units, are in spherical coordi-
nates (r, θ, φ), and are evolved in time t. These equations are

the use of a streamfunction formalism. The angular velocity
of the rotating frame is Ω0 = Ω0ˆz. The gravitational acceler-
ation is g = −g(r)ˆr. In Equation (7), Γ(r) is the radial gradi-
ent of the mean turbulent pressure that maintains hydrostatic
equilibrium as the spherically symmetric state evolves. In the
induction equation, η is the magnetic resistivity. The volu-
metric heating arising from the combination of the CNO and
PP nuclear reaction chains are parameterized in , as in §3.2.
The energy ﬂux q is comprised of a spherically-symmetric,
diffusive radiation ﬂux and a turbulent entropy diffusion ﬂux,

The turbulence achieved in these models is still quite re-
moved from the intensely turbulent conditions likely present
in actual stellar convection zones. Yet with ASH, simulations
of convection and dynamo action in many spectral types of
stars have made signiﬁcant contact with observations and led
to new ways of thinking about stellar dynamos. In particu-
lar, it has been used to simulate a wide range of stars: from
fully convective M dwarfs (Browning 2008), to Sun-like stars
(Brown et al. 2011; Matt et al. 2011; Nelson et al. 2013) and
F-type stars (Augustson et al. 2013), and extended to the con-
vective cores of an early A-type star (Brun et al. 2005; Feath-
erstone et al. 2009).

M4, with upﬂows bright tones and downﬂows as dark tones. (a) The inner

These simulations model the inner 65% by radius of a
young main-sequence B-type star of 10M(cid:12) at eight rotation
rates corresponding to 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16% of
the surface breakup velocity, which is 700kms−1. The name
of the case corresponds to those values as in Tables 1, 2, and
3. The percentage of breakup velocity are equivalent to 0.047,
0.235, 0.47, 0.94, 1.88, 3.75, 7.50, and 15.0 Ω(cid:12). The luminos-
ity at the surface of the star is 5700L(cid:12). The model of the star
consists of a convective core that occupies the inner 30% of
the computational domain by radius, and an overlying radia-
tive exterior that extends to the outer radius of the domain. To
avoid the small time steps required when including the coor-
dinate singularity at origin, the innermost 1% of the core has
been excluded.

The stratiﬁcation is taken from a MESA stellar evolution
model that had evolved a 10M(cid:12) star from the pre-main se-
quence to about 1 Myr, or just past the beginning of its
main-sequence life. The MESA code employs realistic mi-
crophysics and employs the mixing-length approximation to

the convective dynamics within the core (Paxton et al. 2011).
The mean values of ∂ ln /∂ lnT and ∂ ln /∂ ln ρ in the core
of the 1-D stellar model are utilized to build a volumetric
heating in ASH that approximates a spherically-symmetric
and 0 = 2.31×
nuclear burning, which gives  = 0ρ2T 15.33
10−20 ergcm3g−2s−1. The initial conditions for the hydrody-
namical case H4 are random entropy perturbations, and for
its magnetic counterpart M4 a weak dipolar ﬁeld was intro-
duced that was conﬁned to the core. Most of the other mag-
netic cases have been obtained by either spinning up or down
the matured case M4 and continuing the simulations over at
least tens of convective overturning times to further reach a
statistically stationary state. Given the major computational
resources required, the complex evolution of these 3-D solu-
tions was monitored with care to assess the maturity of the
dynamo states achieved, and further extended as deemed ap-
propriate. It was not feasible to extend the simulations over
multiple magnetic or thermal diffusion times across the core.
However, the cases run and analyzed here appear to be a good

representation of the dynamo states that may be realized in
these systems, for no statistically signiﬁcant changes over the
later temporal evolution have been seen in any of the cases.

A comparison between the 1-D stellar model and the back-
ground state used in our 3-D simulation is shown in Figure 2.
The small discrepancy between the Brunt-Väisälä frequency
N displayed in Figure 2 arises from our use of a calorically
perfect gas equation of state. Γ1 and cP are required be con-
stant with radius and that the logarithmic density and tem-
perature be well ﬁt. The radial energy ﬂux balance is shown
in Figure 3, with the convective core and radiative envelope
clearly apparent. Deep in the core, the ﬂows must carry much
more energy given that both the opacity is too large and the
temperature gradient too small to allow radiative diffusion to
carry the local stellar luminosity. This is where convection
transports much of the fusion-generated energy outward with
the aid of the radiation ﬁeld. The ﬂow deeper in the core thus
arranges itself to be more well correlated with the tempera-
ture ﬁeld, which enhances the buoyancy driving and leads to
faster ﬂows. Moving radially outward into the radiative zone,
the radiative transport of energy has risen sufﬁciently to carry
the full luminosity of the star which has reached its ﬁnal sur-
face amplitude. In these simulations, a diffusive LES energy
transport mechanism, which in principle arises from the unre-
solved scales of motion, carries at most 5% of the total energy
as evidenced by the solid green curve in Figure 3. The small
inﬂuence of the LES diffusion is consistent with the relatively
large Rayleigh and Reynolds numbers of these simulations, as
seen in Table 1. The kinetic energy and Poynting ﬂuxes are
less than 0.1% of the total ﬂux and so they are indistinguish-
able from zero with the linear vertical scale used in Figure 3.
The small region of overshooting just beyond the edge of the
core is also of note as it serves as a region of magnetic ﬁeld
storage and gravity wave excitation as will be discussed later
on.

The effective diffusivities ν, η, and κ vary in radius only.
The diffusion is greatly reduced in the stable region, where
motions have a small amplitude and the expected SGS mo-
tions are subsequently smaller.
In the convective core, the
Prandtl number is ﬁxed at Pr = ν/κ = 1/4, so ν = Pr κ. Sim-
ilarly, the Roberts number is constant in the core with Rb =
η/κ = 1/16, leaving η = Rb κ. Outside of the core, the dif-
fusion is tapered to proﬁles that give Pr = Rb = 1. The radial
proﬁle of the thermal diffusivity κ is given by

κ(r) =(cid:0)ρ/ρ1

(cid:1)−1/2(cid:104)

(cid:105)

κ1 (1 + exp[δ (r − rκ)])−1 + κ2

,

(16)

where ρ1 is the background density value at the lower bound-
ary and κ1 is the thermal diffusivity at the lower boundary.
The values of κ1 are shown in Table 1 for each simulation,
along with many other diagnostic ﬂow parameters from the
middle of the convective core. The ﬂoor value of the diffusiv-
ity is κ2. The steepness of the transition between κ1 and κ2
is controlled by δ and occurs at the radius rκ = 6.7× 1010 cm,
which is just outside the core. The minimum levels of diffu-
sion are equal with κ2 = ν2 = η2 = 4× 108 cm2s−1. However,
the magnitude of the molecular value of the diffusivities is
still orders of magnitude less than those that can be achieved
in global-scale simulations. Nevertheless, using this set of
diffusivities, the hierarchy of diffusivities is consistent with
those given by computing the molecular diffusivities follow-
ing Braginskii (1965), which requires that Rb < Pr (cid:28) Pm. In
particular, the magnetic Prandtl number of these large-eddy

simulations is very close to the molecular magnetic Prandtl
number, which is roughly ten throughout the core and drops
to unity in the radiative envelope. Thus, these stars and other
stars with convective cores represent an interesting crossroads
between large-Pm dynamo theory and stellar astrophysics.

4. OVERVIEW OF CORE DYNAMICS

The large-scale convection within the cores exhibits no par-
ticular orientation at slow rotation (cases M1/2 or slower) ex-
cept radially. In contrast, faster rotation brings with it increas-
ingly cylindrical alignment of the convective structures with
the rotation axis. Such alignment is consistent with the mo-
tions being more constrained by the Coriolis force, hence be-
coming quasi-2-D in the spirit of the Taylor-Proudman the-
orem (Pedlosky 1990). These columnar structures may be
quite intricate, yet have some sense of continuity across the
full core. Their number increases with faster rotation, so that
in case M16 roughly eight to ten evolving vortical rolls are
evident at any given time. Those ﬂows in the core generate
internal gravity waves that then propagate following complex
spiral-like ray paths through the radiative envelope above it
(e.g., Zahn et al. 1997; Rogers et al. 2013; Alvan et al. 2015).
Such convective columns formed in the core and the grav-
ity waves that they drive are apparent in Figure 3(a), where
an orthographic projection of the radial velocity in the do-
main is shown for case M4. Since most of the gravity waves
excited here have small radial wavelengths, they damp fairly
quickly due to a relatively large thermal diffusion (Zahn et al.
1997). A self-consistent simulation of such internal gravity
waves that may be pertinent to observations requires the cap-
ture of at least the entire resonant cavity encompassing the
full radiative envelope, which is not the case here. A detailed
analysis of the gravity wave spectrum generated in this set of
simulations will not be presented here. The amplitude of the
ﬂows has two scales in Figure 3(a), in the core the color ta-
ble is clipped to ±100ms−1 and to ±0.1ms−1 in the radiative
zone to emphasize the differing characteristics of the ﬂow in
the convectively unstable and stable regions. Such columnar
ﬂow features are further emphasized in Figure 3(b), which
shows a volume rendering with a cutout of the radial velocity
just in the core.

Turning now to the most rapidly rotating case M16, the
structure of the radial velocity ﬁeld is shown in Figure 5(a),
and its time evolution in Figures 6(a)-(d). The columnar ﬂow
structures involve fast ﬂows interspersed with slower portions,
thereby leading to a rich assembly of evolving folded sheets
and tubules with substructures. This is evident of some aspect
of turbulent ﬂow, yet they possess large-scale ordering that
imprint into the induced magnetic ﬁelds. Figures 5(b, c) show
the magnetic ﬁeld lines that accompany this instant in time,
presenting both an equatorial cut through the full core and a
perspective view from just outside the core boundary. The
equatorial rendering reveals that the strong magnetic ﬁelds
extend across the core and show wrapping at larger radii con-
sistent with the swirling sense of columnar ﬂow cells viewed
along their main axis. The choice here to color code the ﬁeld
lines by the polarity of their radial magnetic ﬁeld component
leads to a change of color from blue to red or vice-versa as
any given ﬁeld line crosses the center of the core. The mag-
netic ﬁeld amplitude reaches up to 2 MG as reported in Table
2. The helicoidal wrapping of the magnetic ﬁeld lines close to
the core-envelope boundary is evident in panel (c) for which
the ﬁeld has been rendered at the same instant and in the same
orientation as in panel (a). The distinctive presence of the un-

the dashed circle) and a small portion of the radiative envelope. The tiny central circle is the inner domain cutout in our computational domain. (a)-(d) display
ﬁve successive samplings of radial velocity vr that are 20 days apart, with downﬂows blue and upﬂows red, and (e)-(h) show the accompanying radial magnetic
ﬁelds Br, with inwardly-directed magnetic ﬁeld in blue and outwardly pointing ﬁeld in red. This interval is in the latest stage of the simulation where the dynamo
has reached a statistically steady state. Clipping values for radial velocity and magnetic ﬁeld are respectively ±100ms−1 and ±105 G.

derlying columnar convection can be seen in these magnetic
ﬁeld line structures, but made more confusing by a number of
magnetic ﬁeld lines connecting across many cells. Indeed, as
the core edge is approached, the magnetic ﬁeld topology tends
to become more toroidal in character, with ﬁeld lines tending
to wrap around the core in the longitudinal direction, some of
which is sampled in panel (c).

The time evolution of the ﬂow structures associated with
the strongest upﬂows and downﬂows in the core occurs ap-
proximately over a local convective overturning time, which
is about 134 days for case M16. This can be appreciated in
Figures 6(a)-(d), where four temporally sequential snapshots
of the radial velocity are shown in the equatorial plane. These
snapshots are 20 days apart, showing the coherence of radial

ﬂow structures over roughly a convective overturning time.
Since the core is rotating fairly rapidly, these ﬂows have a
distinct vortical structure that is largely aligned with the rota-
tion axis. Those columnar ﬂows primarily exist in the outer
region of the core, with increasingly radially symmetric struc-
tures forming deeper in the core. The columnar ﬂows in the
outer convection zone evolve over the shorter time scale of
about 70 days. The more easily identiﬁable columnar struc-
tures evolve nearly in place as the mean ﬂows are weak. As
seen in Figures 6(e)-(h), the magnetic ﬁeld shares a similar
structure to that of the velocity ﬁeld, but it possesses a ﬁner
spatial scale as a result of the large magnetic Prandtl num-
ber. Here again the connectedness of strong magnetic ﬁelds
across the core is evident, though one must take into account

5. EFFECTS OF MAGNETISM ON CORE DYNAMICS
To illustrate the effective impact of the magnetic ﬁeld upon
the structure of the ﬂow itself as well as upon the resulting
angular velocity distribution within the core, it is useful to
compare the hydrodynamic case H4 to its magnetic counter-
part case M4. To this end, one may ﬁrst consider the differ-
ential rotation captured in Figure 7, which displays the time-
averaged and azimuthally-averaged angular velocity achieved
in those two cases.
It is striking that whereas the hydro-
dynamic case possesses very pronounced angular velocity Ω
variations in the core both with radius and latitude, the mag-
netic companion case is nearly in uniform rotation. In case
H4 such variations represents up to 60% of the mean angular
velocity Ω0, but barely reach 10% in case M4. As seen in Fig-
ures 7(a, b, d, e), both simulations exhibit columnar structures
in Ω within the convective cores resulting from angular mo-
mentum redistribution leading to a central column of strongly
retrograde zonal ﬂow in the hydrodynamic case, and one of
weakly prograde ﬂow for the magnetic case. Such columnar
retrograde states of angular velocity have already been real-
ized within hydrodynamical 3-D simulations of core convec-
tion in rotating A-type stars by (Browning et al. 2004; Cai
et al. 2011) and are the direct consequence of low Rossby
number states. Likewise, follow-on simulations of core con-
vection dynamos in A-type stars by Brun et al. (2005) showed
that the presence of magnetism largely suppressed the differ-
ential rotation within the core.

To analyze how the angular momentum is continously re-
distributed within the convective core to achieve such differ-
ing states, it is convenient to appeal to the individual transport
terms as presented in the appendix. Furthermore, it is prac-
tical to focus on the cylindrical components of the angular
momentum ﬂux, given that the quantity of primary interest is
the radial differential rotation of the core. With such a focus, it
becomes clear from Figures 7(c, f) that there is a transfer from
the inﬂuence of the viscous stresses in the hydrodynamic case
H4 to the Maxwell stresses in the MHD case M4. Particularly,
the role of the viscous transport of angular momentum is re-
placed by transport through the ﬂuctuating Maxwell stress.
Indeed, when both the ﬂuid Reynolds number and the Rossby
number are beyond some critical values, and the magnetic
Prandtl number is greater than unity, this behavior should be
expected. The reason for this is that, when temporally and ver-

tically averaged in simulations with under such a parameter
regime, the cylindrically outward angular momentum trans-
port arising from the meridional ﬂows (MC in Figures 7(c, f))
should be minimal. In the hydrodynamic cases, this leaves a
primary balance between the Reynolds stress and the viscous
stress, as is seen in Figure 7(c). Likewise, once magnetic an-
gular momentum transport mechanisms are available in a high
Prandtl number regime, the primary balance is between the
Reynolds stress and the ﬂuctuating Maxwell stress.

Consider next the radial distribution of kinetic and mag-
netic energy in the core and overshooting region of case M16
to further elucidate the interplay between the ﬂows and the
dynamo generated magnetic ﬁelds. As seen in Figure 8(a),
the radial dependence of kinetic and magnetic energies are
found to be nearly constant throughout the core and then to
decrease by about two orders of magnitude in the overshoot-
ing region, which extends further by 6% in proportional ra-
dius beyond the convective core boundary. The magnetic ﬁeld
clearly contains more energy than the ﬂows in the convective
core, as well as in the overshooting region. Given that the ini-
tial condition had zero magnetic ﬁeld outside the core, there
is no magnetic energy in the radiative exterior, except for a
slow diffusion there due to the tapered radial proﬁle of the
magnetic diffusivity η employed here. The peak in the ki-
netic and magnetic energy near r/R = 27% corresponds to the
depth at which the diffusivity coefﬁcients rapidly drop to their
minimum values in the radiative exterior.
It may arise due
to the action of large-scale shear as the rotation proﬁle con-
verges toward a solid body rotation of the radiative exterior,
as indicated by TME being enhanced in that area. The other
cases show similar radial distributions of energy, with it be-
ing nearly constant throughout the core and dropping rapidly
outside of it, and with the ﬂuctuating magnetic energy (FME)
being larger than the energy in the mean ﬁelds (TME + PME).
Figures 8(b, c) present for all magnetic cases the kinetic
and magnetic energy spectra with spherical harmonic degree
(cid:96), averaged in time and quadratically summed over azimuthal
order m, at a radius of r/R = 15%. The kinetic energy spec-
tra in Figure 8(b) has three characteristic regions: the low-
degree (large-scale), the inertial range, and the high-degree
(small-scale) dissipative range. The most striking feature is
the diminution in the amplitude of the large-scale ﬂows as the
rotation rate increases (going from M1/20 to M16). The in-
ertial range at intermediate (cid:96)-values, namely the region that
is likely the result of a self-similar cascade of kinetic energy,

The Magnetic Furnace

The magnetic energy spectra in Figure 8(c) show gradual
change with rotation rate being mostly self-similar. Its ampli-
tude increases monotonically with rotation rate or decreasing
Rossby number. The scales containing the most magnetic en-
ergy are moderate, with the broad peak in the spectrum oc-
curring around (cid:96) = 12 rather than at the lowest wave numbers.
Such an energy distribution could be termed a small-scale dy-
namo, namely the largest-scale modes are not the dominant
ones. Figure 8(d) displays the ratio of the magnetic to the
kinetic energy as a function of harmonic degree at the same
depth as panels (b) and (c). This shows the superequiparti-
tion (or subequipartition) state of a given simulation for all
resolved scales. What is striking is the change of the ME/KE
ratio at low (cid:96) degree by almost 3 orders of magnitude as one
goes from case M1/20 to case M16.
In particular, ME for
cases M8 and M16 is now equal or larger than KE at all scales.
This change of behavior at low (cid:96) degree between slowly and
rapidly rotating cases may be attributable to an increasing in-
ﬂuence of the Coriolis force on the largest scales, as will be
further discussed in §6. When comparing Figures 8(b) and
8(c) and considering the spectra as the rotation rate increases,
it is clear that the increasing of the ME/KE ratio at interme-
diate and smaller scales is primarily due to changes in the
kinetic energy spectrum. Moreover, it is evident that all cases
exhibit a ME/KE ratio that is greater than unity for scales with
(cid:96) ≥ 10 for case M8 and (cid:96) ≥ 20 for cases M1/20 and M1.
This characteristic is another hallmark of a small-scale dy-
namo, which in turn is expected for magnetic Prandtl numbers
greater than a few. The ME/KE ratio grows as large as 20 for
scales with (cid:96) ≈ 130 in case M1/20 and (cid:96) ≈ 230 for case M16.
This occurs because the viscous diffusion is large enough to
begin to quench the ﬂows at those scales before the magnetic
ﬁeld enters its dissipative range of scales, which are smaller
given the large magnetic Prandtl number (Schekochihin et al.
2004) and is a realistic situation in such B-type stars.

6. EXAMINING A CONVECTIVE CORE DYNAMO
Some of the salient features of these convective core dy-
namo simulations are captured in Table 2.
In particular, it
is worth highlighting the ratio of the magnetic energy to the
kinetic energy, as well as the peak and rms magnetic ﬁeld
strengths in the core. The energy densities provided in that
table are deﬁned as follows:

M16, showing total kinetic energy (KE, black), total magnetic energy (ME,

is fairly similar among all the cases. The largest differences
between the cases are where the transition points are between
those three characteristic regions. The relative smoothness of
KE at low (cid:96) arises from the absence of axisymmetric even
modes that are usually connected to the presence of strong
mean zonal ﬂows representing differential rotation that has
been wiped out in these magnetic cases.

ergy relative to the kinetic energy, with that value being ap-
proximately 0.18. These cases are dominated by a balance
between the ﬂuid inertial forces and the Lorentz force. An
exception to this relatively good agreement arises when the
Rossby number of the system reaches the critical threshold of
Ro ≈ 1, which occurs roughly between cases M1 and M2. In
those cases, there appears to be a change in the topology of
the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds, with it becoming more dom-
inantly toroidal. This transitional state can be seen in Figure
9, where there is a minimum in the ratio of the total poloidal
magnetic energy relative to the total toroidal magnetic energy
near the equatorial velocity consistent with case M2.

The degree of equipartition of a given case is intimately tied
to the independent scaling of the kinetic and magnetic ener-
gies. These scalings are captured in Figure 10(a), where the
data and their time-dependent uncertainty are plotted along
with the linear best ﬁts to them. Shown in this manner,
there is a clear transition from a roughly constant scaling for
both the magnetic and kinetic energies to a power law scal-
ing (linear trend in this log-log plot) near the point where the
Rossby number becomes unity for case M1. At that point,
the kinetic energy begins to plunge and the magnetic energy
grows slowly, so their ratio gives rise to the power law scal-
ing with inverse Rossby number.
In particular, the kinetic
energy scales as KE ∝ Ro0.82 and the magnetic energy as
ME ∝ Ro−0.38, which is consistent with the scaling derived
in §2 (e.g., ME/KE ∝ Ro−1) to within the bounds of the mea-
sured uncertainty.

In Figure 10(b) the rms velocity, average entropy perturba-
tion, and average maximum in enthalpy ﬂux are shown for
each of the cases. As was shown in Figure 3, the growth
of the enthalpy ﬂux follows the increase of the total energy
ﬂux arising from nuclear fusion processes deep in the core.
It reaches a maximum value when the radiative ﬂux has in-
creased sufﬁciently to carry the majority of the energy ﬂux.
That value and its uncertainty are plotted. From the ﬁgure, it
is clear that this maximum value is consistent with being con-
stant with Rossby number. Though it is not shown for each
case, the form of the shell and time-averaged enthalpy ﬂux re-
mains nearly constant as well. So, in order to account for the
constant enthalpy ﬂux and the decreasing kinetic energy, and
likewise for the decreasing rms velocity, the entropy perturba-
tions must be assessed. In doing so, it becomes evident that,
contrary to what one might expect from mixing length theory,
the entropy perturbation amplitude also decreases and indeed
more quickly than the rms velocity. In particular, they scale
as vrms ∝ Ro0.40 and s(cid:48) ∝ Ro0.96.

Figure 9. The ratio of total poloidal and toroidal magnetic energy (PE/TE)
is shown as a red circle for each case, and the ratio of the mean poloidal and
mean toroidal magnetic energy (PME/TME) is shown as a blue triangle for
each case.

both rms magnetic ﬁeld and the peak magnetic ﬁelds increase
with faster rotation. Moreover, the ratio of magnetic to ki-
netic energy increases as the rotational constraint on the ﬂows
increases. Additionally, Table 2 shows a decreasing magnetic
energy in the mean magnetic ﬁelds (PME, TME) as a percent-
age of the total magnetic energy. The mean magnetic ﬁelds
are weakest at the slowest and fastest rotation rates, with their
fractional content rising slightly at moderate rotation rates.
Moreover, the decreasing kinetic energy in each more rapidly
rotating case serves to further enhance the ratio of the mag-
netic to kinetic energy as the magnetic energy grows more
slowly than the rate of decrease of the kinetic energy with
increasing rotation rate. Indeed it is fascinating that the dy-
namo sustains superequipartition magnetic ﬁelds once above
a certain rotational threshold. This feature will be the primary
focus of the subsequent sections.

A simple theoretical scaling for the ratio of magnetic en-
ergy to kinetic energy was described in §2, and shown in
Figure 1. This scaling relationship appears to describe the
trend of the measurement of ME/KE from the simulations
quite well, as also shown in Figure 1. This is especially true
of the more rapidly-rotating cases that fall along the magne-
tostrophic asymptote denoted with the dashed green line. This
asymptotic regime is an indication that the primary force bal-
ance in these cases is between the Lorentz and Coriolis forces.
In contrast, the cases with a relatively large Rossby number
tend to fall along a branch of nearly constant magnetic en-

Since the radial enthalpy ﬂux Len ∝ (cid:104)s(cid:48)vr(cid:105), the only remain-
ing possibility is that the correlation between the two ﬁelds
increases rapidly with decreasing Rossby number. This cor-
relation is characterized by corr(s(cid:48),vr) ≈ Len/(L∗s(cid:48)vrms) and
that value and its uncertainty is illustrated in Figure 10(c) for
each case, and it scales as corr(s(cid:48),vr) ∝ Ro−1.11. So, whereas
the velocity and entropy amplitudes decrease with decreas-
ing Rossby number, their correlation increases rapidly and
thereby stems any decrease in the enthalpy ﬂux. Strikingly,
their correlation increases by a factor of about 800. This
occurs because coherent structures form in a rapidly rotat-
ing system, yielding nearly 2-D pseudo-structures that can be
very efﬁcient at heat transport. Indeed, it is well known that
structure formation is typical in rapidly rotating convective
systems, where, even in very turbulent systems, convective
structures that are aligned with the rotation axis are formed
that largely obey the spirit of the Taylor-Proudman constraint.
And, as will be illustrated in Figures 12(a)-(c), such coherent
vortical structures also prove to be efﬁcient at building super-
equipartition magnetic ﬁelds given their ease in enhancing the
local kinetic helicity.

7. GENERATING GLOBAL-SCALE MAGNETISM

There are three components of the magnetic energy gener-
ation that must be considered to see the complete picture of
how the magnetic ﬁelds are sustained. These components of
the total magnetic energy are the production (or destruction)
of ﬂuctuating (FME), poloidal (PME), and toroidal magnetic
energy (TME). Averaging the induction equation in longitude
(Equation 8) yields the following evolution equations for the

components of the total magnetic energy:

Here F indicates a ﬂuctuating magnetic energy generation
term, P a mean poloidal energy generation term, and T a
mean toroidal energy generation term. The subscript of these
monikers denote production in turn by mean induction (MI),
ﬂuctuating induction (FI), and resistive diffusion (RD). For
the ﬂuctuating magnetic energy, there is induction arising
from the action of the mean velocity on the ﬂuctuating mag-
netic ﬁeld (MV), and induction arising from the action of the
ﬂuctuating velocity on the mean magnetic ﬁeld (MB).

The time and core-volume averaged values for each of the
terms in Equations 18 - 20 are given in Table 3. Clearly, when
also considering the amount of energy contained in the vari-
ous components of the magnetic ﬁeld provided in Table 2, the
primary mechanism for generating magnetism in these simu-
lations is through ﬂuctuating inductive processes. Namely, it
is generated through those processes that are comprised of the
product of ﬂuctuating velocity and magnetic ﬁelds with either

the mean ﬁeld (PFI or TFI) or the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld
itself (FFI). Surprisingly, the induction from the mean-ﬁelds
can act to dissipate magnetic energy in the most rapidly ro-
tating cases. However, the vast majority of the dissipation of
magnetic energy is through resistive diffusion, balancing its
generation by the ﬂuctuating inductive processes.

As an example, and to exhibit the radial and latitudinal dis-
tribution of the energy generation or dissipation, each of the
terms in Equation 18 are shown for case M16 in Figure 11.
Simply comparing Figure 11(a) and 11(e) shows that the dom-
inant balance is between the ﬂuctuating induction and resis-
tive dissipation, with the mean ﬁelds playing very minor but
supportive roles in the generation of ﬂuctuating magnetic en-
ergy. One important feature is the nearly uniform distribution
of magnetic energy production through the ﬂuctuating induc-
tion process, which in turn induces the uniform distribution
of the magnetic energy dissipation.
Indeed, these two fea-
tures are shared in all the cases, with only small differences
in the spatial distribution of where the ﬂuctuating induction
takes place.

Turning to the distribution of the time and core-volume av-
eraged values for the components of the total magnetic en-
ergy provided in Table 2, it is clear that more than 93% of
the magnetic energy resides in the ﬂuctuating magnetic en-
ergy for all the cases. Thus, given the small amount of energy
contained in the mean magnetic ﬁelds, they play a small role
in these dynamos. Furthermore, as seen in Table 2, the en-
ergy contained in the differential rotation is in most cases also
small compared to energy contained in the ﬂuctuating velocity
ﬁeld. Therefore, since both those mean ﬁelds have little en-
ergy, the dynamo operating in the cases presented here cannot
be characterized as the α − Ω dynamos that appear to oper-
ate so keenly in the less massive main-sequence stars with an
exterior convective envelope. It is difﬁcult to classify these
core dynamos in terms of a classical mean-ﬁeld dynamo at
all. The reasoning is simple: while the mean-ﬁeld compo-
nent of the magnetic ﬁeld may satisfy some mean-ﬁeld the-
oretic classiﬁcation, there is no such analogy for a system
where the ﬂuctuating magnetic energy is dominant. However,
one may construct a mean-ﬁeld model for the evolution of
the azimuthally-averaged ﬂuctuating magnetic energy, as it is
quadratic in the ﬁeld and does not vanish under the averaging
operator. One such model, based upon the α-effect mean-ﬁeld
theoretic paradigm, is the fairly general bilinear form

(21)

where αi j is a component of a parameterization of the kinetic
helicity that induces magnetic ﬁeld production. In its simplest
form, under the assumption of isotropic α and β tensors, this
reduces to

∂(cid:104)B(cid:48)2(cid:105)

∂t

≈ α(cid:104)HJ(cid:105) − β(cid:104)B(cid:48) ·∇× J(cid:48)(cid:105),

(22)

where HJ is the current helicity. Evaluating this balance in a
global average for each of these terms in all of the magnetic
cases (as detailed in Table 3) does conﬁrm that the dynamo
operating within these simulations are dominated by the ﬂuc-
tuating generation terms. When these magnetic energy gener-
ation balances are examined in an azimuthal average for each
case, they appear nearly identical to those balances seen for
case M16 in Figure 11, where there is both a local and global
balance between ohmic dissipation and magnetic energy gen-
eration by ﬂuctuating induction. Hence, for all of these simu-
lations, this balance is not only a global property but it is also
a local one.

8. LORENTZ FORCE FEEDBACKS

Having seen how these dynamos are able to build magnetic
ﬁeld, the remaining question is how the ﬂows can survive
the strengthening Lorentz forces associated with an increas-
ing rotation rate, which is particularly relevant for the super-
equipartition cases. Indeed, the ﬁrst quantity of note is the av-
erage magnetic energy contained in the core, which is shown
in Table 2. It increases with rotation rate and soon exceeds the
energy contained in the ﬂows. Since the dominant component
of the magnetic energy is the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld, the
increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength cannot be associated with
an increasingly strong mean-ﬁeld as might be expected if the
primary source for the energy for the ﬁeld arose from a differ-
ential rotation. Instead, since the kinetic energy and the ﬂow
velocity are diminished as the rotation rate increases, the only
possible explanation for the continuing growth of the mag-
netic energy is that the structure of the ﬂows is such that they
become inherently more efﬁcient at building magnetic ﬁeld.
The same was seen in §6 and §7 for the maintenance of the
enthalpy ﬂux and the production of magnetic ﬁeld.

The Magnetic Furnace

Such spatial displacements of magnetic and ﬂow struc-
tures can also be seen in Figure 12(d), where the kinetic en-
ergy, magnetic energy and Lorentz work are co-rendered in a
vertical-average of a horizontal slab whose center is located at
the equator. The magnetic energy is rendered in red tones, the
kinetic energy in blue tones, and the Lorentz work in green
tones. The regions of overlapping kinetic and magnetic en-
ergy structures are shown in purple. This makes clear that the
volume ﬁlling fraction of regions where the magnetic and ki-
netic energy structures are co-spatial is relatively small. Like-
wise, the regions where the Lorentz force is doing work on
the ﬂows are fairly small relative to the total volume, further
reﬂecting the systems action to reduce the volume where the
magnetic and velocity structures overlap.

Indeed, even in those regions where the two ﬁelds overlap,
the arrangement of the magnetic and velocity ﬁeld is such that
it reduces both the magnetic ﬁeld generation and the Lorentz
force. The suppression of magnetic induction occurs because
of the increasing alignment of strong ﬂows and ﬁelds, as is
illustrated in Figures 13(c, d). There the PDF of the angle be-
tween the magnetic ﬁeld and the velocity ﬁeld is shown for
ﬁelds that are above the strength of 90% of the CDF, which
are ﬂows of about 200ms−1 and magnetic ﬁelds about 350 kG.
It is of further note that the magnetic ﬁeld is aligned with the
velocity ﬁeld in the northern hemisphere, whereas it is anti-
aligned in the southern hemisphere. For the full PDF of this
angle, it too is bimodal, but is less extreme and is north-south
symmetric. Although it is not shown explicitly because the
PDF is effectively a simple Lorentzian for the angle between
the velocity ﬁeld and the Lorentz force, those PDFs are cen-
tered at 90◦. This implies that these convective dynamos ar-
range themselves such that the Lorentz work is minimized for
all the level sets along the joint CDF of the magnetic and ki-
netic energy.

Considering the auto- and cross-correlations of the mag-
netic and velocity ﬁelds in space and time, the degree of over-
lap or lack thereof can be quantiﬁed. Figures 13(a, b) reveal
that there are signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the nature of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld as a function of rotation. In partic-
ular, the median value of the velocity decreases by about a fac-
tor of three, whereas the tails of the velocity distribution be-
come more truncated. This gives rise to a relatively leptokur-
tic PDF at faster rates of rotation. The PDF of the magnetic
ﬁeld amplitude on the other hand is relatively self-similar, and
only decreases in amplitude slightly, which is only a reﬂection
of the longer tails (increased kurtosis) of the distributions at
faster rotation rates.

In analogy to hydrodynamic simulations that show a tran-
sition from prograde to retrograde equatorial differential
rotation that depends upon the Rossby number (Gastine
et al. 2014), the transition from a subequipartition to a su-
perequipartition state seen in §2 for these convective core dy-
namos is realized when the average Rossby number of the
convective ﬂows drops below unity. In the low Rossby num-
ber regime, the dynamo can sustain a state where the magnetic
energy is greater than the kinetic energy. The way this can
occur is through a spatial displacement of the magnetic and
velocity ﬁeld structures that contain the bulk of the energy
of the system, as seen in Figure 12. Such features can sur-
vive because of the general rotational collimation of the ﬂow,
which means that they avoid being disrupted by most of the
less rotationally-aligned ﬂows. This latter process is one rea-
son that such superequipartition states do not appear to occur

in a snapshot. Regions of large magnetic energy are in red, large kinetic en-

the Lorentz work is large.

Structure formation and increased ﬁeld correlation do not
explain how the convective ﬂows are able to avoid being
quenched by the strong magnetic ﬁelds inducted at faster ro-
tation rates. To see how those ﬂows and magnetic ﬁelds avoid
being mutually destructive rather than mutually productive,
consider Figure 12. This ﬁgure demonstrates features that
likely lead to the avoidance of disruptively strong Lorentz
forces in superequipartition cases. Figures 12(a)-(c) show the
velocity ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, and how they are entangled for
a single convective column in case M16. The ﬁrst aspect to
note is that the velocity ﬁeld is volume ﬁlling, whereas the
magnetic ﬁeld is much more ﬁbril and also forms sheets rather
than a more solid composite structure. When these two struc-
tures are allowed to visually intersect, parts of the two over-
lap. However, much of the magnetic ﬁeld is spatially adjacent
to the velocity ﬁeld structure, effectively forming a magnetic
sheath around the convective column. Indeed, such increas-
ingly ﬁlamentary magnetic ﬁeld structures are somewhat ex-
pected for high Pm systems (Schekochihin et al. 2004) which
are typical of such B-type stars.

14

small-scales has time to generate magnetic ﬁeld that can then
be advected into the longer-lived magnetic structures. Indeed,
the bulk of the inductive production of magnetic energy takes
place in the regions where the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld have
magnitudes that are near or below their median values and at
relatively small-scales. Thus the magnetic structures survive
by absorbing this small-scale ﬁeld as it is advected into them,
which gives rise to an inverse cascade of magnetic energy.

9. REFLECTIONS

The interaction of rotation, convection, and magnetism
within the convective core of a 10M(cid:12) B-type star has been
examined in a suite of 3-D MHD simulations using the ASH
code. Those basic physical elements excite vigorous dynamo
action within the convective core captured within the simu-
lations, where very strong megagauss magnetic ﬁelds are es-
tablished. When magnetic ﬁelds are present, very little dif-
ferential rotation is present and most of the magnetic energy
resides in the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld. The mean-ﬁeld com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld is comparatively small, with its
energy comprising at most 6% of the total magnetic energy.
So, while one may be able to characterize the evolution of
the mean magnetic ﬁeld in terms of an effective ﬁeld theory,
it is not dynamically very relevant. However, it appears that
the evolution of the mean ﬂuctuating magnetic energy can be
characterized in a nearly equivalent way, with the primary ef-
fect being an α-like effect. In particular, there is a coupling
between the kinetic and current helicities that can largely ac-
count for the generation of ﬂuctuating magnetic energy.

Given the careful balances of angular momentum trans-
port, induction, and Lorentz forces realized in these simu-
lations of turbulent convective core dynamos, it is striking
that the clear pattern and scaling of the ratio of the magnetic
and kinetic energies seen in §2 emerges from them. Indeed,
the superequipartition magnetic states are achieved once the
rate of rotation is sufﬁciently large to induce magnetostro-
phy. For these simulations, this transition occurs at about
1% of breakup velocity. These dynamos can sustain such
states without catastrophic Lorentz force quenching through a
spatial displacement of the magnetic and velocity ﬁeld struc-
tures. Moreover, in regions where these structures overlap
and within the context of their statistics, the ﬂow and mag-
netic ﬁeld are nearly aligned and the current vector is effec-
tively orthogonal. This has two effects. The ﬁrst effect is to
minimize the Lorentz work done on the velocity ﬁeld and the
second effect is to reduce the local induction. The latter pro-
cess implies that the bulk of the induction takes place in the
regions where the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld have magnitudes
that are near or below their median values and at relatively
small-scales. Thus it appears that the magnetic structures sur-
vive by absorbing this small-scale ﬁeld as it is advected into
them, which gives rise to an inverse cascade of magnetic en-
ergy.

A tantilizing piece of observational evidence for strong dy-
namo states in formerly convective cores, albeit for somewhat
less massive stars, has recently been found in red giant stars.
In Stello et al. (2016), it is shown that a signiﬁcant fraction
of moderate mass stars that likely possessed a convective core
have suppressed dipolar acoustic modes. Those modes can be
internally reﬂected and trapped deep within the star and thus
are observed with a greatly reduced amplitude (Fuller et al.
2015). With that in mind, these simulations have revealed dy-
namo processes within the cores of more massive stars that
may also have implications for later stages of stellar evolu-

at lower rates of rotation, for the magnetostrophic state is not
achieved at those slow rates (see Figure 1). Moreover, in re-
gions where these structures of fast ﬂows and strong magnetic
ﬁelds overlap and within the context of their statistics (Figure
13), the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld are nearly aligned and the cur-
rent vector is effectively orthogonal. This has two effects. The
ﬁrst effect is to minimize the Lorentz work done on the veloc-
ity ﬁeld and the second effect is to reduce the local induc-
tion. Furthermore, the timescales for diffusion in these simu-

tion. Indeed, the powerful magnetic ﬁelds and superequipar-
tition states attained in these simulations of main-sequence
convective core dynamos could provide a strong-ﬁeld initial
condition for those more evolved states, perhaps even provid-
ing some magnetic conditions for the pre-supernova forma-
tion of the iron core. Moreover, since the ﬂow velocity within
the convective core decreases and the rate of rotation increases
during those later evolutionary stages, the Rossby number is
substantially lower than those realized here. Therefore, the
processes seen to be at work in these simulations may play a
role during the phases leading to the even stronger magnetic
ﬁelds established in neutron stars or magnetars during their
formation.

APPENDIX

The strikingly different angular velocity proﬁles established in the convective cores of the hydrodynamic and magnetic cases
can be interpreted in terms of differing angular momentum ﬂux balances. This is particularly true when they are suitably averaged
in time and longitude. First consider the equation for the evolution of the angular momentum density, which can be obtained
from an appropriate combination of the continuity and momentum equations of compressive MHD as

where, L = λ(vφ + λΩ0), M is the Maxwell stress tensor, and Ptot = Pgas + B2/8π is the total pressure. If a temporal and azimuthal
average of this equation is taken, then

Now consider mean ﬁelds denoted as an overbar that depend only on r and θ and time dependent ﬂuctuating ﬁelds with zero
mean such that

Since D is a linear operator on v, and after applying the average to the expansion of these ﬁelds, it is found that

B = B + B(cid:48),
P = P + P(cid:48),

ρ = ρ + ρ(cid:48).

where a tilde indicates a time and longitudinal average, the mean diffusive ﬂux is D = 2ρνD [v] ˆφ, the ﬂuctuating mean is
D(cid:48) = 2ν (cid:94)ρ(cid:48)D [v(cid:48)] ˆφ, and BP is the poloidal ﬁeld. In the anelastic approximation usually implies that ρ(cid:48)/ρ ≈  (cid:28) 1, where  is an
anelastic expansion parameter. Therefore, the averaged compressible equation above is reduced to

Since the general symmetry of the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld in the core is cylindrical, it is useful to focus on the cylindrical
components of the angular momentum ﬂux. In particular, given Equation 4, it is now easy to identify each of the vertically-
averaged angular momentum ﬂuxes in the cylindrically radial direction as
