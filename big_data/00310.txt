Abstract

The direct bond percolation process (Gribov process) is studied in the presence
of irrotational velocity ﬂuctuations with long-range correlations. The perturbative
renormalization group is employed in order to analyze the eﬀects of ﬁnite correlation
time on the long-time behavior of the phase transition between an active and an ab-
sorbing state. The calculation is performed to the one-loop order. Stable ﬁxed points
of the renormalization group and their regions of stability are obtained within the
three-parameter (ε, y, η)- expansion. Diﬀerent regimes corresponding to the rapid-
change limit and frozen velocity ﬁeld are discussed.

Introduction

For a long time non-equilibrium continuous phase transitions [1] have been an object of
intense research activity. Underlying dynamic laws are responsible for diverse behavior
with respect to their equilibrium counterparts. One of the most prominent example is
the directed bond percolation [2, 3] process, also known as Schl¨ogl ﬁrst reaction [4, 5].
In particle physics this process has been introduced by Gribov [6] in order to explain
hadron interactions at very high energies (Reggeon ﬁeld theory) [7]. Further it can serve
for a description of stochastic reaction-diﬀusion processes on a lattice [8] and spreading of
infection diseases [9] among others.

1

It has been known that phase transitions are quite sensitive with respect to additional
disturbances such as quenched disorder [10] or long-range interactions [8]. From practical
point of view this might be a reason why there are not so many experimental realizations
for the percolation process [11, 12]. Majority of realistic reaction-diﬀusion processes occur
in some ﬂuid environment, e.g., vast majority of chemical reactions is realized at ﬁnite
temperature, which is inevitable accompanied with the presence of thermal ﬂuctuations. In
this paper we assume that the eﬀect of environment can be simulated by advective velocity
ﬂuctuations [13]. Dynamics of the ﬂuids is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation [14].
A general solution of these equations still remains an open question [15, 16]. Kraichnan
model appears as a more tractable problem. In this model velocity ﬁeld is assumed to obey
a Gaussian distribution law with prescribed statistical properties [13, 17]. Though at a
ﬁrst sight too oversimpliﬁed with respect to the realistic ﬂows, it nevertheless captures an
essential physical information about advection processes [13]. Moreover some properties
as intermittency are even more pronounced than for the Navier Stokes equation itself.

Recently, there has been increased interest in diﬀerent advection problems in com-
pressible turbulent ﬂows [18, 19, 20, 21]. These studies show that compressibility plays
an important role for population dynamics or chaotic mixing of colloids.
In this work
we consider a generalization of the original Kraichnan model proposed in [22]. There
advection-diﬀusion problem of non-interacting admixture was studied in the presence of
velocity ﬁeld with ﬁnite correlation in time and compressibility taken into account. Our
main motivation is to use this model and determine what inﬂuence it has on the critical
properties of the directed bond percolation process. We note that in our model there is no
backward inﬂuence of percolating ﬁeld on the velocity ﬂuctuations, i.e., our model corre-
sponds to the passive advection of the scalar quantity. As initial steps in this direction have
already been undertaken [23, 24, 25, 26], our main aim here is to elucidate in detail the dif-
ferences between incompressible and compressible velocity ﬁeld. The main theoretical tool
is the ﬁeld-theoretic approach [27] with subsequent Feynman diagrammatic technique and
renormalization group (RG) approach, which allows us to determine large-scale behavior.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce a ﬁeld-theoretic version of
the problem. In Sec. 3 we describe main steps of the perturbative RG procedure. In Sec. 4
we present an analysis of possible regimes involved in the model. We analyze numerically
and to some extent analytically ﬁxed points’ structure.
In Sec. 5 we give a concluding
summary.
2 Field-theoretic model

The eﬀective ﬁeld-theoretic action [28] for directed percolation can be obtained either
from the Langevin formulation or via reaction-diﬀusion scheme employing Doi formalism
[29]. However, at the very end one arrives at the same De Dominicis-Janssen action
[30, 31, 32]

Jper[ ˜ψ, ψ] = ˜ψ[∂t + D0(τ0 − ∇2)]ψ +

(1)

D0λ0

2

[ψ − ˜ψ] ˜ψψ,

where all irrelevant contributions from the RG point of view have been neglected. Field ψ
corresponds to the ﬂuctuating density of percolating agents, ˜ψ stands for auxiliary Martin-
Siggia-Rose ﬁeld (MSR), ∂t = ∂/∂t is the time derivative, ∇2 is the Laplace operator, D0
is the diﬀusion constant, g0 is the coupling constant and τ0 measures a deviation from the

2

threshold value for injected probability. It can be thought as an analog to the temperature
variable in the standard ϕ4−theory [28, 33]. For the future RG use we have extracted
a dimensional part from the interaction terms in the action (1). In this paper we use a
condensed notation in which expressions are viewed as matrices or vectors with respect
to component indices, the spatial variable x and the time variable t, respectively. For
example, the ﬁrst term in the action (1) actually reads

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

dt

ddx ˜ψ(t, x)∂tψ(t, x),

(2)

where d is the dimensionality of the x space. Here and henceforth we distinguish be-
tween unrenormalized (with a subscript “0”) quantities and renormalized terms (without
a subscript “0”).

The next step consists of an incorporation of the velocity ﬂuctuations into the model.

The standard route [14] is based on the replacement
∂t → ∂t + (vi∂i),

(3)

In accordance with [17, 22]
where the summation over the spatial index i is implied.
we assume that the velocity ﬁeld is a random Gaussian variable with zero mean and a
translationally invariant correlator [22] given in the Fourier representation

Here, P k
operator, respectively. Further k = |k| and a positive parameter α > 0 can be interpreted
as the simplest possible deviation [34] from the incompressibility condition ∂ivi = 0. The
incompressible case, α = 0, has been analyzed in previous works [23, 25, 26]. The coupling
constant g10 and the exponent y describe the equal-time velocity correlator or, equivalently,
the energy spectrum [15, 17, 22] of the velocity ﬂuctuations. The constant u10 > 0 and the
exponent η are related to the characteristic frequency ω (cid:39) u10D0k2−η of the mode with
wavelength k.

The kernel function for the correlator (4) has been chosen in a universal form and as such
it contains diﬀerent limits: rapid-change model, frozen velocity ensemble and turbulence
advection (see [17, 22]).
In this paper our main goal is to analyze the case of purely
potential (irrotational) velocity ﬁeld. To this end one more rescaling of the variable g1
according to

αg1 → g1, α → ∞.

is needed. Then, in the perturbation theory we eﬀectively work with the following velocity

3 Renormalization group analysis

In order to apply the dimensional regularization for an evaluation of renormalization con-
stants, an analysis of possible superﬁcial divergences must be performed. For transla-
tionally invariant systems, it is suﬃcient [33, 35] to analyze 1-particle irreducible (1PI)
graphs only. In contrast to static models, dynamical models [27, 36] contain two indepen-
dent scales: a frequency scale dω
Q for each quantity Q. The
corresponding dimensions are found using the standard normalization conditions

together with a condition ﬁeld-theoretic action to be a dimensionless quantity. Using values

can be introduced, whose precise form is obtained from a comparison of IR most relevant
terms (∂t must scale as ∇2) in the action (1). The total dimension dQ for the dynamical
models plays the same role as the conventional (momentum) dimension does in static
problems. Dimensions of all quantities for the model are summarized in Table 1. To retain
the standard notation we have introduced ε via relation d = 4−ε. It follows that the model
is logarithmic (when coupling constants are dimensionless) at ε = y = η = 0, and the UV
divergences are in principle realized as poles in these parameters. For the RG analysis it is
of crucial importance that the couplings become logarithmic at the same time. Otherwise,
one would have to discard IR irrelevant ones and some scaling regimes will be absent.

The total dimension dΓ in the logarithmic theory is a formal degree of the UV divergence

be present only in those functions Γ for which δΓ is a non-negative integer [27].

Dimensional analysis should be augmented by certain additional considerations.

the ﬁelds ˜ψ vanish, and it is suﬃcient to consider functions with N ˜ψ ≥ 1. As was shown in
[24] the rapidity symmetry ψ(t) → − ˜ψ(−t), ˜ψ → −ψ(−t) requires also inequality Nψ ≥ 1
to hold. Using these considerations together with relation (10), possible UV divergent
structures are expected only for the 1PI Green functions listed in Table 2.

In what follows we employ the perturbative RG approach, which allows us to calcu-
late universal quantities in formal series in small parameter of theory. In contrast to the
standard ϕ4-theory our model contains three small expansion parameters (ε, η, y). Also we
would like to make the following remark. The real expansion parameters in a perturbative
sense are the charges g1 and g2 = λ2 only (the latter fact is a consequence of rapidity
symmetry). The parameters u1 and α correspond to the non-perturbative quantities, and
there is no physical restriction on their values. Therefore one can study also a limiting case
such as u10 → 0 or u10 → ∞.

Before we embark on results of the RG approach, let us ﬁrst discuss in detail profound
diﬀerences caused by compressibility and lack of Galilei invariance [37, 38, 39] in our model.
As shown in [24] instead of relation (3) the following replacement is necessary

∂t → ∂t + (vi∂i) + a0(∂ivi),

(11)

where a0 is an additional positive parameter, whose signiﬁcance can be explained as follows.
For pure advection-diﬀusion problem [22] the choice a0 = 1 corresponds to the conserved
quantity ψ (density), whereas for a0 = 0 auxiliary ﬁeld ˜ψ is conserved. For the whole
model nor ψ neither ˜ψ is conserved, hence both ﬁelds ˜ψ and ψ are ﬂuctuating quantities
and RG procedure will give a birth to both counterterms ˜ψ(vi∂i)ψ and ˜ψ∂i(viψ). In the
language of Feynman diagrams let us consider a one-loop expansion of 1PI function ˜ψψv
that can be formally written as

Γ ˜ψψv = −ipjZ4 − iaqjZ5 +

+

,

(12)

where p is a momentum of the ﬁeld ψ and q of the ﬁeld v, respectively. A direct calculation
shows that a divergent part of the ﬁrst graph is

iλ2
0

4d(2π)dε

[2pj − qj].

(13)

Let us consider such graph as a subgraph in some high-order loop for an incompressible
case.
In this case all velocity propagators are proportional to the transverse projector
and after contraction with (13) the compressible part evidently drops out. However, in our
model the velocity propagator (4) contains also a longitudinal part. Moreover in contrast to

5

Kraichnan model, also the second graph in (12) is divergent (due to the ﬁnite correlation in
time the graph does not contain a closed loop of retarted propagators [27, 36]). Symmetries
play a fundamental role in physics.
In turbulent problems Galilei invariance [27] is of
prominent importance. It describes an invariance with respect to transformations ϕ → ϕv
given by

ϕ(cid:48)
v(x) = ϕ(cid:48)(xv),

x ≡ (t, x),

(cid:90) t

−∞

ϕv(x) = ϕ(xv) − v(t),
xv ≡ (t, x + u(t)),

u(t) =

dt(cid:48)v(t(cid:48)).

(14)

From Table 2 it follows that possible superﬁcial divergences may appear also in the struc-
ture Γ ˜ψψv2. Aforementioned Galilei invariance restricts presence of such term.
In our
model however such term must be taken into account and considered as a new interaction
parameter. The one-loop expansion for this function using only cubic interactions reads

Γ ˜ψψv2 =

u2
D

δijZ8 +

+

.

(15)

A straightforward calculation shows that the ﬁrst and the third graph cancel each other,
whereas second graph gives a non-zero contribution. This is again a consequence of ﬁnite
correlation time, which precludes appearance of closed loops of retarted propagators. To
conclude the ﬁeld-theoretic action given by the sum of (1) and (7) has to be augmented
by the following part describing the advection interaction

Jadv[ϕ] = − u20
2D0

˜ψψv2 + ˜ψ(vi∂i)ψ + a0

(16)
The ﬁeld theoretic action J = Jper +Jvel +Jadv is amenable to the Feynman diagrammatic
technique with the subsequent use of perturbative RG approach. Note that the added
interaction term ˜ψψv2 directly leads to additional 5 Feynman diagrams for 1PI function

that have to be taken into account. The multiplicative renormalization can be achieved
through following renormalization prescription

D0 = DZD,
g10 = g1µyZg1,
˜ψ = Z ˜ψ

τ0 = τ Zτ + τc,
u10 = u1µηZu1,

a0 = aZa,
λ0 = λµε/2Zλ,
v = ZvvR,

g20 = g2µεZg2,
u20 = u2Zu2,

(18)

where µ is the reference mass scale in the MS scheme [33]. Note that the term τc is a non-
perturbative eﬀect [28], which is not captured by the dimensional regularization. Physically
it describes ﬂuctuation-induced shift of critical probability τ0.

IR stable regimes

The large scale behavior with respect to spatial and time variables is governed by
the attractive IR stable ﬁxed points g∗. Here and henceforth the asterisk refers to a
coordinate of the ﬁxed point (FP). Their coordinates are determined from the zeros of RG
ﬂow equations [27, 33, 35]

βg1(g∗) = βg2(g∗) = βu1(g∗) = βu2(g∗) = βa(g∗) = 0.

(19)
The eigenvalues of the matrix of ﬁrst derivatives Ω = {Ωij} determine whether given FP
is IR stable. Such points are proper canditates for macroscopic regimes and thus can be
observed experimentally. The matrix Ω is deﬁned as

Ωij =

∂βi

i, j ∈ {g1, g2, u1, u2, a}.

(20)

The explicit form of beta functions follows from (18) using deﬁnition βg = µ∂µg|0 and a
straightforward calculation yields
βg1 = g1(−y + 2γD − 2γv),
βu1 = u1(−η + γD),

(21)
where γx ≡ µ∂µ ln Zx|0 are the anomalous dimensions [27]. In the 1-loop approximation
they are given by the following expressions

4.1 Rapid change model

The rapid change model [22] is characteristic by u∗

1 = 0 which, having in mind the
replacement (24), corresponds to velocity propagator (6) with short range correlations in
time. For this case seven FPs were found. Out of them only four (FPI
5 and
FPI
6) are IR stable. Coordinates of all ﬁxed points are listed in Table 3. As we can see
the coordinates depend only on the diﬀerence y − η, which conﬁrms previous expectations
[17, 22]. Here NF stands for Not Fixed, i.e., the corresponding value of a charge coordinate

could not be unambiguously determined. In that case the given FP, rather than to a point,
corresponds to the whole line of FPs. From the explicit expression for βa in (25) we can
draw a conclusion about points for which a∗ = 0. For them this relation is exact and is
fulﬁlled to all orders in a perturbation theory. The schematic depiction of the phase space
structure can be found in Fig. 1. The phase boundaries for the FPI

in the numerical way and therefore they are not included.

FPI

1 corresponds to the free (Gaussian) theory for which all interactions are irrelevant
and ordinary perturbation theory is applicable. However, existence of such point is neces-
sary condition for the RG approach [27]. For the FPI
2 the correlator of the velocity ﬁeld is
irrelevant and this point describes a standard DP universality class [28]. Remaining two
ﬁxed points represent nontrivial regimes, for which velocity ﬂuctuations as well as percola-
tion interaction are relevant. In Fig. 1 we observe that the realizability of the regime FPI
5
crucially depends on the non-zero value of η.

4.2 Thermal ﬂuctuations

Now we analyze a special case of the rapid-change model, which describes thermal
ﬂuctuations [40]. They are characterized by quadratic dispersion law and in our choice of
velocity correlator (4), an additional condition

η = 6 + y − ε

(26)

has to be met. A phase structure in the plane (ε, y) is depicted in Fig. 2. For physical
space dimensions d = 3 (ε = 1) and d = 2 (ε = 2) the only stable regime is that of pure
DP. The nontrivial regimes FPI
6 are realized only in the nonphysical region for
large values of ε. This numerical result conﬁrms our previous expectations [23, 24].
It
was pointed out [41] that genuine thermal ﬂuctuations can change IR stability of the given
universality class. However, this is not realized for the percolation process itself.
4.3 Frozen velocity ﬁeld

5 and FPI

Frozen velocity limit is obtained for the choice of u1 = 1.

In the formulation of an
advection of density ﬁeld [22] it corresponds to the model of random walks in a random
environment with long-range correlations [42]. In this case ﬁve ﬁxed points can found and
their coordinates are listed in Table 4. Only the points FPII
4 are IR stable.
The ﬁxed point FPII

1 describes the free (Gaussian) theory. It is stable in the region

Table 4: Coordinates of the ﬁxed points for the frozen velocity ensemble.

For the FPII

2 the velocity ﬁeld is irrelevant and the only relevant interaction is the

nonlinearity of the percolation process. This FP is stable in the region

ε > 6y,

ε > 0,

ε > 12η.

1 and FPII

FPII
4 embodies a nontrivial regime for which both velocity and percolation interactions are
relevant. The regions of stability for the FPII
2 are depicted in Fig. 3. Because
for these two points the velocity ﬁeld could be eﬀectively neglected, it directly follows that
given boundaries could not depend on the value of parameter α. The stability region of
FPII
4 can be computed only numerically and it turns out that it depends on α. From Fig.
3 we observe that the correlation parameter η crucially aﬀects boundaries between FPII
2
and FPII
4 .
5 Conclusions

In this paper we have studied percolation spreading in the presence of irrotational
velocity ﬁeld with long-range correlations. The coarse grained model was formulated and
multiplicative renormalizability of the ﬁeld theoretic model was discussed in detail.

We have found that depending on the values of a spatial dimension d = 4 − ε, scaling
exponents y and η, describing statistics of velocity ﬂuctuations, the model exhibits various
universality classes. Some of them are already well-known: the Gaussian (free) ﬁxed point,
a directed percolation without advection and a passive scalar advection. The remaining
points correspond to new universality classes, for which an interplay between advection
and percolation is relevant.
It was shown [43] that anomalous scaling behavior is destroyed when α and y are large
enough. Therefore only relatively small values of α are allowed (α (cid:28) 1) in our model.
They correspond to small ﬂuctuations of the density ρ, what is tacitly supposed in our
investigation. In other words, it is assumed that the velocity of the ﬂuid is much smaller
than the velocity of the sound in the system (the Mach number Ma (cid:28) 1). Nevertheless
we believe that a qualitative picture for large values of compressibility should remain the
same. A possible further investigation should take into account additional eﬀects such as
feedback on the dynamics of the advecting ﬁeld, anisotropies or broken mirror symmetry.
