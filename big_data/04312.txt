We calculate the total and the diﬀerential cross section for np scattering at low energies in the
isospin I = 1 channel within the so-called extended Linear Sigma Model. This model contains
conventional (pseudo)scalar and (axial–)vector mesons, as well as the nucleon and its chiral partner
within the mirror assignment. In order to obtain good agreement with experimental data we need
to consider two additional resonances: the lightest scalar state f0(500) and a dibaryon state with
quantum numbers I = 1, J P = 0+ (a.k.a. 1S0 resonance). The resonance f0(500) is coupled to
nucleons in a chirally invariant way through the mirror assignment and is crucial for a qualitatively
correct description of the shape of the diﬀerential cross section. On the other hand, the dibaryon
is exchanged in the s–channel and is responsible of the large cross section close to threshold. We
compare our results to data summarized by the SAID program of the CNS Data Analysis Center.

INTRODUCTION

Nucleon-nucleon scattering at low energies has been investigated using diﬀerent eﬀective approaches, see e.g. Refs.
[1–10] [see also Ref. [11] and refs. therein], which are constructed according to the principles of chiral perturbation
theory (ChPT) [12], the low-energy eﬀective theory of the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). In ChPT, the chiral symmetry of QCD is nonlinearly realized.

As initiated long ago in Ref. [13] [see also Ref. [14]], another possibility to describe low-energy hadronic physics is
based on the linear realization of chiral symmetry via so-called Linear Sigma Models, see e.g. Ref. [15]. A modern
variant is the extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM), which contains (pseudo)scalar and (axial–)vector mesons and
which was successfully applied in the context of meson-meson interactions [16–19] and also meson-nucleon interactions
[20–22]. In particular, baryons and their chiral partners are treated in the so-called mirror assignment, in which a
chirally invariant mass term is present [23–25]. This is important, since the smallness of the πN sigma term implies
that chiral symmetry breaking alone cannot be responsible for the nucleon mass and other sources (such as a gluon
condensate) must exist which contribute to generating the mass of the nucleon.

In this work, we use the eLSM in order to study nucleon-nucleon scattering. In particular, we investigate neutron-
proton scattering in the I = 1 channel up to a nucleon momentum of about 0.4 GeV in the center of momentum
(c.m.) frame. In order to describe experimental data, we need, apart from the usual quark-antiquark ﬁelds [see e.g.
Ref. [26]], to also incorporate the light f0(500) meson [for studies of this resonance see e.g. Refs. [27, 28] as well as the
recent review [29]]. As ﬁrst shown in Ref. [20] and then further investigated in Refs. [30, 31], the resonance f0(500)
can be coupled to the eLSM in a chirally invariant way; the condensation of the ﬁeld associated with this resonance
is then responsible for the emergence of the chirally invariant mass term mentioned above. As shown in Ref. [30] by
studying nuclear matter saturation and in Ref. [32] by studying the binding energy of nuclei, this resonance generates
an attraction between nucleons. In the present work we will conﬁrm that its coupling to nucleons is necessary for a
reasonable description of neutron-proton scattering data.

However, the exchange of mesons alone (even after the inclusion of f0(500)) is not capable of describing the enhanced
interaction close to the neutron-proton threshold. As discussed previously in Ref. [2], an additional resonance with
baryon number 2, isospin 1, as well as J P = 0+ (equivalent to 1S0 in the old spectroscopic notation) is needed. This
dibaryon resonance is exchanged in the s-channel and enhances considerably the cross section at threshold (up to a
nucleon c.m. momentum p of about 0.2 GeV). We will also determine the parameters of this resonance, such as the
nominal mass mR and width (as well as an estimate of its pole position in the complex
s plane). It turns out that
the on-shell tree-level decay width is larger than the diﬀerence DR ≡ mR − mp − mn of its mass from the threshold.
As a consequence, this state is not a conventional Breit-Wigner resonance due to strong threshold eﬀects.

√

Indeed, in some of the previous works [8–10] the dibaryon ﬁeld was regarded as an auxiliary ﬁeld that can be
integrated out in order to obtain an eﬀective Lagrangian which contains only nucleonic degrees of freedom. For
the purpose of nucleon-nucleon scattering phenomenology, this is certainly a reasonable and well-deﬁned approach.

However, we believe that it is interesting to treat this state as a dibaryon resonance. Moreover, as a consequence, we
also expect an analogous resonance in the neutron-neutron channel and possibly also in the proton-proton channel.

This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we present the model with special attention to the resonance f0(500)
and the dibaryon resonance. In Sec. III we discuss our results for the I = 1 neutron-proton total and diﬀerential cross
sections, step-by-step including various contributions. The cross sections are compared to experimental data from the
SAID program of the CNS Data Analysis Center [33, 63]. Finally, in Sec. IV we give our conclusions and an outlook.

The Lagrangian of the model used in our calculations has three parts:

II. THE MODEL

(i) The mesonic part of the eLSM Lagrangian. This has been developed and investigated for the two-ﬂavor case
(Nf = 2) in Refs. [16, 17], for the three-ﬂavor case (Nf = 3) in Refs. [18, 19], and recently for the four-ﬂavor
case (Nf = 4) in Ref. [34]. For the explicit form of the Lagrangian, see the aforementioned references.

(ii) The nucleonic part of the eLSM Lagrangian. For Nf = 2, it includes the interaction of the nucleon and its chiral
partner N∗ (both states referred to as ”nucleons” in the following) with ¯qq mesons and a scalar isoscalar meson
f0(500) [20, 21, 30] in a chirally invariant framework [recently, the baryonic Lagrangian has been extended to
Nf = 3 in Ref. [22]]. In Sec. II A we present the Lagrangian for Nf = 2 together with its parameters, while in
Sec. II B we consider only those terms which enter the calculation of nucleon-nucleon scattering. Moreover, we
also show how to include a form factor which suppresses the interaction strength at high momenta.

(iii) The Lagrangian describing the interactions of two nucleons with the 1S0 dibaryon. This is constructed in Sec.

II C.

A. The eLSM Lagrangian for nucleons

In the mirror assignment and in the two-ﬂavor case, the eLSM Lagrangian in the nucleon sector has the form [20]:

LeLSM = ¯Ψ1LiγµDµ

− ˆg1( ¯Ψ1LΦΨ1R + ¯Ψ1RΦ†Ψ1L) − ˆg2( ¯Ψ2LΦ†Ψ2R + ¯Ψ2RΦΨ2L)

1RΨ1R + ¯Ψ2LiγµDµ

2RΨ2L + ¯Ψ2RiγµDµ

where:

(i) the ﬁrst line of Eq. (1) describes the interaction of the nucleons with (axial–)vector mesons via the derivatives

D1(2)L(R), which are deﬁned as:

1R = ∂µ − ic1Rµ , Dµ
Dµ
2R = ∂µ − ic2Rµ, Dµ
Dµ

1L = ∂µ − ic1Lµ ,
2L = ∂µ − ic2Lµ .

(3)

The left-handed and right-handed ﬁelds Lµ and Rµ contain the vector mesons ωµ and (cid:126)ρµ and the axial–vector
mesons f µ

1 and (cid:126)aµ

Lµ = (ωµ + f µ

(5)
where t0 = 12/2 is half the (2×2) unit matrix and (cid:126)t = (cid:126)σ/2, σi being the ith Pauli matrix. The correspondence of
the ﬁelds to quark-antiquark mesons listed in the PDG [35] is reported in Table I. Vector mesons are an important
ingredient for a good description of low-energy nucleon vacuum phenomenology, see e.g. Refs. [20, 36].

Rµ = (ωµ − f µ

1 )t0 + ((cid:126)ρµ − (cid:126)aµ

1 ) · (cid:126)t ,

(ii) The second line of Eq. (1) describes the interaction of the nucleons with the (pseudo)scalar mesons, parametrized

in terms of the matrix

Φ = (σ + iηN )t0 + ((cid:126)a0 + i(cid:126)π) · (cid:126)t ,

and can be expressed as a combination of the physical ﬁelds η and η(cid:48) as: ηN = cos ϕP η−sin ϕP η(cid:48) where the mixing
angle is ϕP ≈ −44◦ [18]; in the other sectors we neglect the small strange-nonstrange mixing.] The interaction
terms in the second line provide a contribution to the nucleon masses via the condensation of σ (σ → σ + φ,
where φ is the chiral condensate). In the original Linear Sigma Model, this was the only contribution to the
nucleon mass in the chiral limit.

(iii) The third and last line of Eq. (1) describes the interaction of the nucleon ﬁelds Ψ1 and Ψ2 with the scalar ﬁeld
χ. The latter gives a contribution to the nucleon masses due to the condensation of χ (χ → χ + χ0). The mass
parameter

was discussed in the pioneering work of Ref. [23] and further investigated in Refs. [20–22, 24, 25]. In Ref. [30]
it was suggested that the mass term m0 arises from the condensation of the scalar isoscalar ﬁeld χ. The latter
corresponds to the resonance f0(500) in the context of nuclear physics [30, 31].

The ﬁeld N corresponds to the nucleon N (939) while N∗ to its chiral partner, which could be N (1535) or N (1650).
For the purposes of the present work, the assignment of N∗ is not crucial. For the sake of deﬁniteness, we will use
the results of Ref. [21], in which N (1650) is regarded as the chiral partner. On the other hand, in an enlarged mixing
scenario [22], N (1535) is favored as the chiral partner of the nucleon. However, using this alternative scenario does
not lead to noticeable quantitative changes of our results.

The masses of the nucleon N and its chiral partner N∗ are given by:

(11)
In the limit m0 → 0, one obtains the result mN = ˆg1φ/2, i.e., the nucleon mass is solely generated by the chiral
condensate [as in the original Linear Sigma Model [13, 14]].

We recall that Z = (1− g1wφ)−1/2 = 1.67 > 1, where g1 = 5.84 describes the coupling constant of (pseudo)scalar and
(axial–)vector mesons, and w = g1φ/m2
a1 . This parameter arises from the mixing of pseudoscalar and axial–vector
mesons, see Refs. [16, 18]. As a consequence, the condensate reads φ = Zfπ, where fπ = 0.0924 GeV is the pion decay
constant. The importance of vector mesons is evident, since only for nonzero c1 and c2 (and for Z > 1), it is possible
to get an agreement of the axial coupling constants with experimental data and lattice-QCD calculations [37].

In total, the nucleon part of the model has ﬁve independent parameters (a, ˆg1, ˆg2, c1, c2), which are determined by
using the PDG values mN = 0.939 GeV, mN∗ = 1.650 GeV, ΓN∗→N P = 0.128 GeV, the axial coupling constant
gN
A = 1.267, as well as lattice-QCD calculations of the axial coupling constant gN
A = 0.55 [37], for details and
determination of the errors, see Ref. [20]. Explicitly:

∗

c1 = −3.34 , c2 = 14.74 , ˆg1 = 9.47 , ˆg2 = 18.69 , m0 = 0.704 GeV .

(14)

Finally, as described in Ref. [30], the condensate χ0 takes the form χ0 = gχππφ2/m2

χ, where gχππ is the χππ coupling
constant [38, 39]. Its numerical value was determined to be 0.45 GeV [30] by requiring a correct description of the
nuclear matter ground state. Since we assign χ ≡ f0(500), we use mχ = (0.475 ± 0.25) GeV [35]. As a consequence
of χ0 = gχππφ2/m2

χ, the constant a in Eq. (1) reads:

a =

m0
χ0

=

m0m2
χ

gχππ(Zfπ)2 .

(15)

The value of a as given by Eq. (15) is the maximum value for the coupling of χ to nucleons. If other scalar condensates
(e.g. a glueball condensate) contribute to the mass parameter m0, Eq. (7), the value of a would be reduced. Hence, for
the results presented in Sec. III we will choose also lower values for a than given by Eq. (15), if necessary to achieve
good agreement with data.

B. Lagrangian for nucleon–nucleon elastic scattering

Only some of the terms contained in Eq. (1) contribute to elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering (for instance, the
nucleon resonance N∗ does not contribute). We thus split the full Lagrangian LeLSM = LN N + Lrest, where the
relevant terms for our calculations are contained in LN N . Its explicit form in terms of physical ﬁelds reads:

hadrons (nucleons and mesons) which have a ﬁnite extension (∼ 0.5 fm). Therefore, the tree-level diagrams derived
from the Lagrangian (1) are valid when the momentum exchanged at a certain vertex is smaller than ∼ 2 fm−1 (cid:39) 0.4
GeV. Therefore, as various works have shown, see e.g. Refs. [40–43] and also Ref. [35, see section ”Quark model in
Standard Model and Related Topics”], and as we shall also see later on, it is important to introduce a form factor
which reduces the interaction strength when the momenta of the hadrons are large. In this work we will use the

C.

Interaction Lagrangian for the 1S0 dibaryon

The interaction of nucleons via meson exchange is not capable of describing the large cross section close to threshold.
Namely, the interaction strength is three orders of magnitude larger than what can be achieved through meson
exchange: a neutron-proton resonance is responsible for the enhanced cross section.

In order to describe this resonance within our framework, we introduce a new ﬁeld, denoted as ΦR, which has
quantum numbers I = 1, J P = 0+ (a.k.a. 1S0) and contributes to I = 1 np scattering close to threshold. The wave
function of the Iz = 0 component (of relevance for the following) is given by

(19)
Being part of an isospin multiplet, there are two analogous states, |pp(cid:105) with Iz = 1, and |nn(cid:105) with Iz = −1, see the
corresponding discussion in Sec. IV.

|ΦR(cid:105) = |space: ground state(cid:105)|↑↓ − ↓↑(cid:105)|np + pn(cid:105) .

The Lagrangian coupling ΦR to nucleons is given by:

(cid:0)N T Cγ5ΦRt1N + ¯N γ5Φ∗Rt1C ¯N T(cid:1) ,

LR = iGR

(20)

where C denotes the charge-conjugation matrix. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (20) describes the two
incoming nucleons creating the dibaryon, while the other term describes the decay of the dibaryon into two outgoing
nucleons. A similar Lagrangian for the deuteron was studied in Ref. [41]. The corresponding Feynman diagram for
np scattering is shown in Fig. 2.

Using Eq. (20) we calculate the width Γ(p) of the 1S0 state as:

Γ(p) =

G2
Rp
4π

,

(21)

where p denotes the modulus of the three-momentum of an outgoing nucleon. The propagator of the 1S0 state is

where mp and mn are the proton and the neutron masses, respectively. For a good description of data it is essential
to consider the decay width as a function of p, i.e., Γ(p). Setting the decay width to a constant, ΓR ≡ Γ(pR), where
pR ≡ p(m2
R), (i.e., the Breit-Wigner limit) is deﬁnitely not a good approximation in the present context. Hence, the
quantity mR should not be regarded as a conventional resonance mass, but as a parameter corresponding to the root
of the real part of the denominator of the propagator, see also the discussion in Sec. III A.

III. RESULTS

We now turn to the results. We present them successively including more ingredients: (i) we consider only the
scalar dibaryon [Eq. (20)]; (ii) we consider a reduced model with the dibaryon and the scalar meson χ ≡ f0(500)
[Eq. (20) and the last line of Eq. (16)]; (iii) we include all other mesons without form factor [Eqs. (16) and (20) with
Λcut → ∞]; (iv) we include also a form factor [Eqs. (16) and (20) with ﬁnite Λcut].
In all cases, the cross section for np scattering in the I = 1 channel was calculated by splitting the scattering
amplitude M into two parts, MI=0 and MI=1, according to the formalism presented in Ref. [44]. The results were
cross-checked by calculating the cross section for pp scattering using the programs FeynRules 2.0 [45] and MadGraph
2.3.0 [46]. Results of both calculations were identical within numerical precision.

A. Scalar dibaryon only

We ﬁrst consider the case where only the Lagrangian (20) is considered. The interaction is mediated by the dibaryon
resonance ΦR. The left panel of Fig. 3 shows the total cross section for diﬀerent values of DR = mR − mp − mn,
where mR is the mass parameter entering Eq. (22). As one observes, the total cross section is very large at threshold
and drops rapidly with increasing momentum. The best agreement with data is obtained for the dibaryon coupling
strength GR = 2.13 and for DR = 0.0015 GeV. Namely, we obtain a good description of the data over three orders of
magnitudes up to a c.m. momentum of about 0.2 GeV. Clearly, the calculation using only the 1S0 resonance cannot
describe the data at higher momenta. For momenta above 0.2 GeV, the interaction via meson exchange (as, for
instance, described via the eLSM Lagrangian) dominates.

As expected, there is no angular dependence (at any p) of the theoretically calculated diﬀerential cross section when
only the dibaryon is included, see right panel of Fig. 3. On the contrary, data show an enhancement at forward and
backward angles. This enhancement increases with momentum and, as we shall see, can be explained considering
meson exchange (in particular f0(500)).

In conclusion, we ﬁnd that there is an isotriplet dibaryon resonance with nominal mass mR = mp +mn +0.0015 GeV.
The corresponding on-shell decay width is ΓR = 0.0135 GeV, which is much larger than DR. Whenever the tree-level
decay width is comparable to or larger than the distance of the mass from the threshold, we are not dealing with a
standard resonance, see e.g. Ref. [47] and refs. therein. Here, the situation is even more extreme, since ΓR (cid:29) DR.
This is also why many authors were extremely careful in discussing this putative state as a standard resonance.
s plane exists. To this end, we investigate the presence of a pole
by using the formalism discussed in Ref. [48]: we introduce a form factor in the decay width, Γ(p) → ΓΛR (p) =

The next question is if a pole in the complex

The latter is plotted in Fig. 4 using ΛR = 0.5 GeV [close to the values obtained in Refs. [48, 49]]. One notices a peak
very close to threshold (only 0.0000174 GeV away from it) and then a rapid descent. Note that the peak does not
correspond to the nominal mass mR. Since ΛR is a free parameter, we also show the spectral function for ΛR = 0.3
GeV. The quantitative diﬀerence to the previous case is small, the qualitative features remain the same.

In the literature, it is common to investigate the existence and position of pole(s) in the complex

s plane, especially
in presence of wide resonances [as, for instance, in the renowned case of the resonance f0(500), see Ref. [29] and refs.
therein]. For ΛR = 0.5 GeV we ﬁnd a pole for

We observe that the decay width associated with the imaginary part of the pole is much larger than the tree-level
decay width: Γpole = 0.1548 GeV. In addition, the pole mass, being 0.014 GeV above the threshold, is larger. For
this very peculiar resonance there is no correspondence between nominal mass, peak of the spectral function, and pole
mass.

Finally, for ΛR = 0.3 GeV, the pole is located at

which has a larger mass but a smaller width. While the spectral function changes only slightly by changing ΛR, the
position of the pole changes sizably. The precise determination of the pole is not possible at present, since the value

of ΛR (as well as the precise form of the form factor) is unknown. Nevertheless, the existence of a pole in the complex

s plane is a deﬁnite result of our analysis.

B. Dibaryon and f0(500)

In the next step, we add the contribution from χ ≡ f0(500) [last line of Eq. (16)] to that of the dibaryon state of
Eq. (20). Using mχ = 0.525 GeV and a = 8.95, it is indeed possible to obtain a remarkably good agreement with data
up to a momentum p of about 0.4 GeV, see Fig. 5. This shows the importance of the lightest scalar state f0(500).
We recall that this meson is not (predominantly) a quark-antiquark state [the chiral partner of the pion is identiﬁed
with the heavier state f0(1370) [18]]. Also the description of the diﬀerential cross section is improved, since now the
qualitative form is correctly described (for p = 0.2 GeV the agreement is also quantitatively quite good).
It is interesting to notice that good agreement with data is reached for a mass of f0(500) of about 0.5 − 0.55 GeV,
which is in good agreement with the PDG value. Increasing or decreasing the value of the mass by about 0.1 GeV or
more considerably worsens the description of the experimental results.

resonance with DR=0.0018 GeV and GR=2.26. The green dashed curve shows the cross section calculated using only π and
η exchange. In the right panel, the diﬀerential cross section is shown for nucleon c.m. momenta 0.1 GeV (red dotted curve),
0.2 GeV (green dashed curve), and 0.3 GeV (magenta dash-dotted curve) upon exchange of the nine mesons. Data points are
taken from the SAID program.

C. Full model without form factor

We now turn to the case in which the sum of the two Lagrangians (16) and (20) is considered, i.e., when all other
mesons are also present. First, we do not include any form factor in the calculation (i.e., Λcut → ∞). The mass of
f0(500) is chosen to be mχ = 0.475 GeV and a = 8.95.

The results are shown in Fig. 6.

In part (a), one observes that the theoretically calculated total cross section
signiﬁcantly overestimates the data for large momenta. The reason for this is the contribution from the pseudoscalar
mesons (green dashed curve). In addition, the theoretically calculated diﬀerential cross sections, part (b), show the
wrong behavior as a function of scattering angle: they are enhanced at 900, while the experimental data are suppressed.
Apparently, adding the contributions from exchange of quark-antiquark mesons worsens the agreement with ex-
perimental data as compared to the previous case. One possibility to ameliorate the situation could be to modify
the parameters of the Lagrangian (1). Quite curiously, for c1 = 1.5 the contribution of the pions turns out to be
suppressed due to destructive interference. However, by doing so, one would inevitably induce a disagreement with
other quantities, such as the nucleon masses and the axial coupling constants. Another possibility, explored in the
following subsection, is to use a ﬁnite cutoﬀ, which eﬀectively takes into account that hadrons are extended objects,
and which suppresses the contribution from pseudoscalar mesons to an extent that the good description obtained with
the 1S0 resonance and f0(500) exchange alone is re-obtained.

D. Full model with form factors

As a last step we consider both Lagrangians (16) and (20) as well as the form factor introduced in Eq. (18). As Fig.
7 shows, a cutoﬀ Λcut = 0.778 GeV suppresses the contributions of the quark-antiquark mesons (and in particular
pseudoscalar mesons) at large momenta. The data can be again well described.

The diﬀerential cross sections point also to an interesting fact: if the contribution from f0(500) is turned oﬀ, the
angular distribution is again enhanced at 900, in contradiction with experimental data which is suppressed at this
angle. When f0(500) is taken into account, the correct shape of the diﬀerential cross section is obtained. Apparently,
suppressing the contribution of quark-antiquark mesons by a form factor is not suﬃcient to produce the correct angular
dependence of the diﬀerential cross section, one needs to include the f0(500) in order to repair this shortcoming. This
conﬁrms once more the important role of this meson for a good description of nucleon-nucleon scattering data.

respectively. Data points are taken from the SAID program.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have studied neutron-proton scattering in the I = 1 channel in the framework of a chiral model which
contains quark-antiquark (pseudo)scalar and (axial–)vector mesons as well as a scalar isoscalar state corresponding
to the resonance f0(500) (see Fig. 1 for the corresponding diagrams). The f0(500) state is coupled to nucleons in a
chirally invariant way using the mirror assignment for the chiral partner of the nucleon.

The exchange of mesons (Fig. 1) alone is not suﬃcient to describe the very large total cross section close to threshold.
For this reason, we have coupled the nucleons to a resonance with baryon number B = 2, isospin I = 1, total spin
zero, and positive parity, J P = 0+. Then, for a suitably chosen coupling to the nucleons, s-channel scattering through
this resonance is able to reproduce the magnitude of the total cross section close to threshold, see Fig. 2.

The results have been presented by including the ingredients step by step. The total cross section close to threshold
can be well described with the help of the dibaryon alone (Fig. 3). A more detailed study of this resonance shows that
it is not of a standard Breit-Wigner type, because the width is larger than the distance of its mass to the neutron-
proton threshold. Its spectral function (Fig. 4) shows a peak very close to threshold. In the complex plane, we ﬁnd
a pole. For a cutoﬀ of 0.5 GeV the pole lies at mp + mn + 0.014 GeV − i 0.0774 GeV, conﬁrming that the resonance
is very broad. However, the pole is not precisely determined because a slight modiﬁcation of the parameters changes
its position quite substantially. Nevertheless, the important point is that a pole is always present, which shows that a

dibaryon resonance exists. Interestingly, a similar conclusion concerning a metastable neutron-proton state was also
obtained in Ref. [50] and recent experimental activity is described in Ref. [51].
As a consequence of our results, we also predict the existence of a neutron-neutron resonance very close to threshold:
this state is the Iz = −1 member of the I = 1 multiplet of scalar dibaryons. The neutron-neutron resonance is not
aﬀected by Coulomb repulsion, thus the characteristics of the corresponding resonance are expected to be similar to
the proton-neutron dibaryon studied in this work. Indeed, in Ref. [52] a scalar neutron-neutron resonance has been
observed experimentally. The corresponding decay width of about 0.01 GeV is actually in good agreement with our
results (for the width of the np state, which should be very similar to the one of the nn state). The subsequent
theoretical study of Ref. [53] by means of an eﬀective Lagrangian conﬁrmed that such a dineutron state cannot be
excluded. Quite interestingly, the existence of scalar isotriplet dibaryon may also be relevant in the context of nuclear
astrophysics [54]. Also, the recent discovery of a four-neutron quasi-bound state [55] shows that the formation of
metastable states made solely of neutrons is possible.

The last member of the isotriplet dibaryon multiplet has Iz = 1 and consists of two protons.

In this channel
predictions are more diﬃcult in view of the Coulomb repulsion that breaks isospin symmetry. However, also here a
resonance could exist, but would be even more unstable, see the experimental study in Refs. [56, 57] and theoretical
discussion in Ref. [58].

Turning back to neutron-proton scattering studied in this work, the next step has been the inclusion of the resonance
f0(500): a remarkably good agreement with data is obtained when only the dibaryon and the resonance f0(500) are
considered (Fig. 5). These results show that these two resonances are most important for the description of the
experimental data.

Switching on the other mesons causes a disagreement at large momenta, because the contribution of the pions is
too large without introducing a form factor to suppress large momenta. Moreover, also the diﬀerential cross sections
cannot be reproduced (Fig. 6). This mismatch can, however, be removed by including a form factor. One then obtains
a good description of data at high momenta (Fig. 7). Also in this case, the role of f0(500) is important: by switching
it oﬀ, the shape of the diﬀerential cross section is qualitatively wrong.
As an outlook for future studies, one could use our chiral approach to study reactions in which mesons are produced,
such as N N → N N X with X = ω, ρ, . . . [see Ref. [59] for a preliminary investigation]. These reactions are at the
center of experimental studies, see e.g. Ref. [60], and their investigation is important in hadronic physics. Also similar
reactions involving strangeness are relevant: for that purpose one would need the full version of the eLSM for Nf = 3,
including baryons [a ﬁrst step towards this goal has been performed in Ref. [22]]. For instance, the reaction pp → ppK
has received considerable attention [61]. The determination of the baryon-baryon-meson couplings in the three-ﬂavor
case is not only relevant for hadron vacuum physics but also in the context of neutron-star investigations [62].

[63] Although SAID provides consistent isospin–averaged total and diﬀerential np scattering cross sections, the quoted I = 0

and I = 1 diﬀerential np scattering cross sections seem to be wrong by a factor of two. In our analysis, we have taken this
factor into account, i.e., we divided SAID data by a factor of two.
