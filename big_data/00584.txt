FLOER HOMOLOGY AND COVERING SPACES

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Abstract. We prove a Smith-type inequality for regular covering spaces in monopole
Floer homology. Using the monopole Floer / Heegaard Floer correspondence, we deduce
that if a 3-manifold Y admits a pn-sheeted regular cover that is a Z/pZ-L-space (for p
prime), then Y is a Z/pZ-L-space. Further, we obtain constraints on surgeries on a knot
being regular covers over other surgeries on the same knot, and over surgeries on other
knots.

1. Introduction

Monopole Floer homology [KM07] and Heegaard Floer homology [OS04c, OS04b] are
two leading theories used to study three-dimensional manifolds. Recently, the two theories
have been shown to be isomorphic, by work of Kutluhan-Lee-Taubes [KLT10a, KLT10b,
KLT10c, KLT11, KLT12] and of Colin-Ghiggini-Honda [CGH12b, CGH12c, CGH12a] and
Taubes [Tau10]. Although Floer homologies have found many applications, their interaction
with many classical topological constructions is still not fully understood. The purpose of
the present paper is to study their behavior with respect to regular coverings. Coverings
play a fundamental role in three-dimensional topology, particularly in view of the recent
proof of the virtually ﬁbered conjecture [Wis11, Ago13]. Although our results are limited
to covers between rational homology spheres, we expect that some of the techniques will
extend to more general covers between three-manifolds.

Our model is the following well-known inequality, due to P. Smith [Smi38, Flo52, Bre72].
Suppose that a group G of order pn (where p is prime) acts on a compact topological space
X, and let X G denote the ﬁxed point set. The mod p Betti numbers of X and X G are then
related by:

(1)

Xi

dim Hi(X G; Z/pZ) ≤Xi

dim Hi(X; Z/pZ).

Seidel and I. Smith [SS10] proved that an analogue of (1) holds for Lagrangian Floer homol-
ogy, under certain conditions. Speciﬁcally, they only considered the case G = Z/2Z, and
assumed that the Lagrangians admit a stable normal trivialization. Hendricks [Hen12] used
their result in the context of Heegaard Floer theory to show that the knot Floer homology
of a knot K ⊂ S3 has rank at most as large as the knot Floer homology of K inside the
double branched cover Σ(K).

Another natural setting in which one can hope to apply the Seidel-Smith inequality is

the Heegaard Floer homology of covers. If eY → Y is a covering of closed 3-manifolds, one
can obtain a Heegaard diagram for eY from a Heegaard diagram for Y ; see the work of Lee
and Lipshitz [LL08]. If eY → Y is a double cover and we take suitable symmetric products

of the Heegaard surfaces, we end up almost in the setting of Seidel-Smith. However, a

stable normal trivialization does not exist for the Lagrangians under consideration, and
this approach runs into diﬃculties. An alternative approach would be to use monopole
Floer homology, as deﬁned by Kronheimer and Mrowka [KM07], instead of Heegaard Floer
homology. Diﬃcult issues related to equivariant transversality arise in this setting as well.
Our strategy is to work with another version of monopole Floer homology. In [Man03],
the second author deﬁned an invariant of rational homology spheres, which takes the form
of an equivariant suspension spectrum. Speciﬁcally, given a rational homology sphere Y
equipped with a Spinc structure s, one can associate to it an S1-equivariant spectrum
SWF(Y, s). The construction uses ﬁnite dimensional approximation of the Seiberg-Witten
equations, and skirts transversality issues. This makes it possible to prove the following:

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that eY is a rational homology sphere, Y is orientable, and π : eY →

Y is a pn-sheeted regular covering, for p prime. Let s be a Spinc structure on Y . Then, the
following inequality holds:

(2)

Xi

dim eHi(SWF(Y, s); Z/pZ) ≤Xi

dim eHi(SWF(eY , π∗s); Z/pZ).

Observe that, under the assumptions of the theorem, Y must be a rational homology
sphere as well. Indeed, if H 1(Y ; Z) 6= 0 then there would exist a surjective homomorphism

π1(Y ) → Z. Since π1(eY ) ⊆ π1(Y ) is a subgroup of ﬁnite index, the restriction of that
homomorphism to π1(eY ) would be nontrivial, which would contradict b1(eY ) = 0.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 is not diﬃcult. The Floer spectrum SWF is constructed from
Conley indices in the ﬁnite dimensional approximations, and (2) follows from an application
of the classical Smith inequality (1) to these Conley indices.

Theorem 1.1 becomes powerful in conjunction with our work from a previous paper
[LM14]. There, we proved that the monopole Floer homology of Kronheimer and Mrowka
can be recovered from SWF(Y, s). Speciﬁcally, if Y is a rational homology sphere with a
Spinc structure s, we showed that there are isomorphisms

(3)

}HM ∗(Y, s) ∼= eH S1

∗ (SWF(Y, s)), gHM ∗(Y, s) ∼= eH∗(SWF(Y, s)).

Here, }HM is the “to” version of monopole Floer homology deﬁned in [KM07], gHM is Bloom’s
version of monopole Floer homology from [Blo11], and eH S1

∗ denotes reduced equivariant

Thus, from Theorem 1.1 we obtain the following inequality in monopole Floer homology:

(Borel) homology.

Corollary 1.2. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, we have

(4)

(5)

dim gHM (Y, s; Z/pZ) ≤ dim gHM (eY , π∗ s; Z/pZ).

Furthermore, by applying the work of Kutluhan-Lee-Taubes and of Colin-Ghiggini-Honda
and Taubes on the monopole Floer / Heegaard Floer equivalence, we can rephrase our results
in terms of Heegaard Floer theory. We have

gHM (Y, s) ∼= HF +

∗ (Y, s), gHM (Y, s) ∼= dHF ∗(Y, s),

where HF + and dHF are two versions of Heegaard Floer homology from [OS04c]. Corol-

lary 1.2 turns into an inequality in Heegaard Floer homology:

Corollary 1.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, we have

(6)

dimdHF (Y, s; Z/pZ) ≤ dimdHF (eY , π∗ s; Z/pZ).

FLOER HOMOLOGY AND COVERING SPACES

One can adapt these arguments to obtain a similar result for HFred, the reduced version

of Heegaard Floer homology deﬁned in [OS04c]:

Theorem 1.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, we have the inequality:

In [OS04a], Ozsv´ath and Szab´o deﬁned a Z/pZ-L-space to be a rational homology sphere

dim HFred(Y, s; Z/pZ) ≤ dim HFred(eY , π∗

s; Z/pZ).

means that HFred(Y, s; Z/pZ) = 0 for all s. Inequality (6) (or, alternatively, Theorem 1.4)
has the following immediate consequence:

such that dHF (Y ; Z/pZ) has dimension |H1(Y ; Z)| over Z/pZ (for p prime). Equivalently,
dHF (Y, s; Z/pZ) should be one-dimensional for all Spinc structures s. In terms of HFred, this
Corollary 1.5. Suppose that π : eY → Y is a regular pn-sheeted covering of orientable
3-manifolds, for p prime. Then, if eY is a Z/pZ-L-space, so is Y .

The Z/pZ-L-spaces are of interest because of various geometric properties. For example,
a Z/pZ-L-space Y cannot support co-orientable taut foliations, and no contact structure
on Y admits a symplectic ﬁlling with b+

2 > 0; see [OS04a, Proof of Theorem 1.4].

A more natural notion is that of an L-space [OS05a], which is deﬁned to be a rational

homology sphere Y with the property thatdHF (Y, s) is free Abelian of rank |H1(Y ; Z)|. An L-

space is a Z/pZ-L-space for all p. Examples of L-spaces include all elliptic manifolds [OS05a,
Proposition 2.3], all double branched covers of S3 over quasi-alternating links [OS05b],
and many others. In the context of monopole Floer homology, L-spaces were studied in
[KMOS07].

Corollary 1.5 has the following implication with regard to L-spaces:

suppose that for any intermediate cover Y ′ (i.e., such that there exist possibly trivial covers

Corollary 1.6. Suppose that π : eY → Y is a regular covering of orientable 3-manifolds,
such that eY is an L-space, and the group of deck transformations is solvable. Further,
eY → Y ′ and Y ′ → Y ), the group dHF (Y ′) is torsion-free. Then Y is an L-space.
no known examples of rational homology spheres with dHF containing torsion. (For the

ﬁrst examples of Z-torsion in Heegaard Floer homology, see [JM08]. Those examples have
b1 > 0.) Potentially, the notions of L-space and Z/pZ-L-space are the same.

The torsion-free assumption in Corollary 1.6 is not unreasonable.

In fact, there are

Ozsv´ath and Szab´o asked whether, among prime, closed, connected 3-manifolds, L-spaces
are exactly those that admit no co-orientable taut foliations.
In a similar vein, Boyer,
Gordon, and Watson [BGW13] conjectured that an irreducible rational homology 3-sphere
is an L-space if and only if its fundamental group is not left-orderable. It is worth noting
that both of these potential alternate characterizations of L-spaces behave well under taking

in [BGW13]:

covers. Indeed, suppose that eY → Y is a covering between compact 3-manifolds. If Y has
a co-orientable taut foliation, then so does eY . Also, if π1(Y ) admits a left-ordering, then so
does its subgroup π1(eY ). In view of these observations, the following question was raised
Question 1.7 (Boyer-Gordon-Watson, [BGW13]). If π : eY → Y is a covering map, Y is
orientable, and eY is an L-space, does Y have to be an L-space?

Our Corollary 1.6 can be viewed as a partial answer to Question 1.7. More evidence
for an aﬃrmative answer to Question 1.7 comes from manifolds with Sol geometry or with

4

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Seifert geometry, or more generally graph manifolds. For Seifert ﬁbrations, the equivalence
between L-spaces, non-left-orderable fundamental groups, and the absence of co-orientable
taut foliations has already been established [LS07, BRW05, Pet09, BGW13]. This implies
that the answer to Question 1.7 is “yes,” provided that Y has Seifert geometry.
If one
works with Z/2Z-coeﬃcients, the same holds for Sol geometry [BRW05, BGW13] and graph
manifolds [BC14, HRRW15].

Note that the covering of the Poincar´e homology sphere by S3 is an example of a regular
cover with non-solvable automorphism group, for which the conclusion of Corollary 1.6 still
holds. By taking intermediate covers corresponding to non-normal subgroups of the binary
icosahedral group, we can also get examples of irregular covers between L-spaces.

Remark 1.8. It is worth pointing out that a rational homology sphere that covers an L-
space is not necessarily an L-space. For example, consider the double cover of S2 over itself,
branched at two points. By introducing two orbifold points of type 1/4 at the branch points
on the base, and an orbifold point of type 2/3 somewhere else on the sphere, we obtain a
genuine double cover between 2-orbifolds:

S2(2/3, 2/3, 1/2, 1/2) → S2(2/3, 1/4, 1/4).

This pulls back to a double cover between Seifert ﬁbered rational homology spheres

M (−2; 2/3, 2/3, 1/2, 1/2) → M (−1; 2/3, 1/4, 1/4),

in the notation of [LS07]. By the criterion in [LS07, Theorem 1.1], M (−1; 2/3, 1/4, 1/4) is
an L-space, whereas M (−2; 2/3, 2/3, 1/2, 1/2) is not.

In view of the inequality (6), it is natural to ask the following strengthened version of

Question 1.7:

Question 1.9. If π : eY → Y is a covering map between closed orientable 3-manifolds, and

s is a Spinc structure on Y , do we necessarily have

Here, rk denotes the rank of an Abelian group.

rkdHF (Y, s) ≤ rkdHF (eY , π∗

s) ?

Some partial results along these lines, for double covers with b1 > 0, were obtained by

Lipshitz and Treumann using methods from bordered Floer homology [LT12].

We now turn to some concrete topological applications of our covering inequalities. For
any family of rational homology spheres where we can obtain a good understanding of their
monopole or Heegaard Floer homologies, we can look for obstructions to covering. For
example, we have:

Corollary 1.10. Let K be a hyperbolic alternating knot and let L be any quasi-alternating
link. Then, the double branched cover Σ(L) is not an rn-sheeted regular cover of S3
p/q(K)
for any prime r.

Proof. By [OS05a], S3
p/q(K) is not a Z/rZ-L-space for any r. If L is a quasi-alternating
link, then as discussed above, Σ(L) is an L-space; cf. [OS05b]. The result now follows from
Corollary 1.5.
(cid:3)

Remark 1.11. It is interesting to compare Corollary 1.10 to the case where K is a non-
hyperbolic alternating knot, i.e., K = T (2, 2n + 1). Then there are inﬁnitely many lens
space surgeries (namely those of the form p/q where |(4n + 2)q − p| = 1 [Mos71]). Any such

FLOER HOMOLOGY AND COVERING SPACES

5

lens space regularly covers inﬁnitely many other lens spaces; in fact, we can ﬁnd a cover
of this form with any ﬁnite cyclic deck transformation group. Notice that lens spaces are
branched double covers of two-bridge links with non-zero determinant, and such two-bridge
links are quasi-alternating by [OS05b].

Let us focus further on manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on knots in S3. The Hee-
gaard Floer homology of surgeries on knots can be computed in terms of the knot Floer
complex; see [OS08, OS11]. This yields a rank inequality between the reduced Heegaard
Floer homologies of diﬀerent surgeries. Using Theorem 1.4, we obtain:

Theorem 1.12. Let K be a non-trivial knot in S3 and let p, q, p′, q′ be positive integers. If
p
q ≤ 1 and ⌈q/p⌉ < ⌊q′/p′⌋, then S3
p′/q′(K)
for any prime r.

p/q(K) cannot be an rn-sheeted regular cover of S3

While Theorem 1.12 can be considerably strengthened, we work with it in its current

incarnation to keep both the statement and proof simple.

Remark 1.13. The condition that K be non-trivial is clearly necessary, as for all non-
zero q ∈ Z and p′/q′ ∈ Q, the surgery S3
1/q(U ) = S3 is a p-fold regular cyclic cover of
S3
p′/q′(U ) = L(p′, q′).
Remark 1.14. If K is the right-handed trefoil, then there are inﬁnitely many pairs of surg-
eries for which one regularly covers the other with number of sheets a prime-power. Indeed,
p/q surgery on K gives the lens space L(p, 4q) when p = 6q ± 1; cf.
[Mos71, Proposi-
tion 3.2]. Let rn be a prime power of the form 6k + 1 for a positive integer k. Then
S3
(6q′±1)/q′ (K) = L(6q′ ± 1, 4q′) for
(6q±1)/q(K) = L(6q ± 1, 4q) is a regular rn-cover of S3
q′ = q + k(6q ± 1). Note that these examples have surgery coeﬃcients greater than 1, unlike
in the statement of Theorem 1.12. Similar examples can be found for other torus knots.

The results and examples above raise the following question:

Question 1.15. For what knots K ⊂ S3 do there exist pairs of surgery coeﬃcients p
such that S3

p/q(K) is a cover of S3

p′/q′(K)?

q 6= p′

q′

Surgeries of this form can be called virtually cosmetic. Thus, Question 1.15 generalizes
the problem of characterizing all cosmetic surgeries, i.e., those with S3
p′/q′(K).
This is related to the cosmetic surgery conjecture, which asks if a non-trivial knot can have
orientation-preserving homeomorphic surgeries [Gor91, Conjecture 6.1]; for recent progress
using similar techniques to those used here, see for example [OS11, NW15].

p/q(K) ∼= S3

In a diﬀerent direction, we can also obtain obstructions to covering between surgeries on
diﬀerent knots. A simple class of examples come from L-space knots, which are knots for
which some positive surgery is an L-space. We have the analogous notion of Z/rZ-L-space
knots.

Theorem 1.16. Let K and K ′ be non-trivial Z/rZ-L-space knots and p, p′, q, q′ positive
integers satisfying

(2g(K) − 1)⌈q/p⌉ < (2g(K ′) − 1)⌊q′/p′⌋,

then S3

p/q(K) is not an rn-sheeted regular covering of S3

p′/q′(K ′) for any prime r.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we outline the construction of the Seiberg-
Witten Floer spectrum from [Man03]. In Section 3 we discuss covering spaces and prove

6

Theorems 1.1 and 1.4, as well as their corollaries. In Section 4 we recall the knot surgery
formula from [OS11], and use it to deduce Theorems 1.12 and 1.16.

rem 1.4.

2. The Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum

We review here the construction of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum SWF(Y, s), fol-

lowing [Man03]. We mostly use the notational conventions from [LM14].

2.1. The Seiberg-Witten equations in global Coulomb gauge. We will be studying
the Seiberg-Witten equations on a tuple (Y, g, s, S), where Y is a rational homology three-
sphere, g is a metric on Y , s is a Spinc structure on Y , and S is a spinor bundle for s. We
choose a ﬂat Spinc connection A0 on S which gives an aﬃne identiﬁcation of Ω1(Y ; iR) with
Spinc connections on S.

Consider the conﬁguration space

C(Y, s) = Ω1(Y ; iR) ⊕ Γ(S).

The gauge group G = G(Y ) := C ∞(Y, S1) acts on C(Y, s) by u · (a, φ) = (a − u−1du, u · φ).
Since b1(Y ) = 0, each u ∈ G can be written as ef for some f : Y → iR. We deﬁne the

normalized gauge group G◦ to consist of those u = ef ∈ G such that RY f = 0.

Let ρ : T Y → End(S) be the Cliﬀord multiplication. Further, for a ∈ Ω1(Y ; iR), we will
use Da : Γ(S) → Γ(S) to denote the Dirac operator corresponding to the connection A0 + a,
and D for the case of a = 0.

Inside of C(Y, s) we have a global Coulomb slice to the action of G◦:

W = ker d∗ ⊕ Γ(S) ⊂ C(Y, s),

where d∗ is meant to act on imaginary 1-forms.
For any integer k, we let Wk denote the L2

k Sobolev completion of W . We consider the

Seiberg-Witten map:

where

(7)
(8)

l + c : Wk → Wk−1,

l(a, φ) = (∗da, Dφ)
c(a, φ) = (π ◦ τ (φ, φ), ρ(a)φ + ξ(φ)φ),

where π denotes the L2 orthogonal projection to ker d∗, and ξ(φ) : Y → iR is characterized

by dξ(φ) = (1 − π) ◦ τ (φ, φ) and RY ξ(φ) = 0. Note that l is a linear Fredholm operator,

and c is compact. The Seiberg-Witten map is the gradient in an appropriate metric of the
Chern-Simons-Dirac functional, L, deﬁned by

L(a, φ) =

1

hφ, Daφi −ZY

a ∧ da(cid:17).

Let I ⊂ R be an interval. If a map γ : I → Wk satisﬁes

d
dt

γ(t) = −(l + c)(γ(t)),

FLOER HOMOLOGY AND COVERING SPACES

we say that γ is a Seiberg-Witten trajectory (in Coulomb gauge). Such a trajectory γ =
(a(t), φ(t)) : R → Wk is said to be of ﬁnite type if L(γ(t)) and kφ(t)kC0 are bounded in t.
2.2. Finite-dimensional approximation. For λ > 1, let us denote by W λ the ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace of W spanned by the eigenvectors of l with eigenvalues in the interval
(−λ, λ). The L2 orthogonal projection from W to W λ will be denoted ˜pλ. We modify this
to make it smooth in λ, by deﬁning:

(9)

β(θ)˜pλ−θ

−λ+θdθ,

pλ =Z 1

0

where β is a smooth, non-negative function that is non-zero exactly on (0, 1), and such that

RR β(θ)dθ = 1. Observe that the image of pλ is the subspace W λ.

On W λ, we consider the ﬂow equation

(10)

d
dt

γ(t) = −(l + pλc)(γ(t)).

We refer to solutions of (10) as approximate Seiberg-Witten trajectories.
Fix a natural number k ≥ 5. There exists a constant R > 0, such that all Seiberg-
Witten trajectories γ : R → W of ﬁnite type are contained in B(R), the ball of radius R in
Wk. The following is a corresponding compactness result for approximate Seiberg-Witten
trajectories:

Proposition 2.1 (Proposition 3 in [Man03]). For any λ suﬃciently large (compared to R),
if γ : R → W λ is a trajectory of the gradient ﬂow (l + pλc), and γ(t) is in B(2R) for all t,
then in fact γ(t) is contained in B(R).

2.3. The Conley index and the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum. The Seiberg-
Witten Floer spectrum will be deﬁned by means of the Conley index, an important con-
struction from dynamical systems [Con78]. We brieﬂy recall the relevant deﬁnitions.

Let {φt} be a one-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms of a smooth manifold X. For a

subset A ⊆ X, deﬁne

Inv(A, φ) = {x ∈ A | φt(x) ∈ A for all t ∈ R}.

Note that if A is compact, so is Inv(A, φ). We say that a compact set S ⊆ X is an isolated
invariant set if there is a compact set A such that S = Inv(A, φ) ⊂ int(A). We call A an
isolating neighborhood for S . The Conley index of an isolated invariant set is roughly a
pair consisting of an isolating neighborhood and the set of points where the ﬂow exits the
isolating neighborhood. We make this precise.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A pair (N, L) with N, L compact subsets of X is called an index pair for
an isolated invariant set S if
a) Inv(N − L, φ) = S ⊂ int(N − L),
b) for all x ∈ N , if φt(x) 6∈ N for some t > 0, then there exists 0 ≤ τ < t with φτ (x) ∈ L,
and we call L an exit set for N ,
c) for x ∈ L and t > 0, if φx(x) ∈ N for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t, then φs(x) ∈ L for 0 ≤ s ≤ t and we
say L is positively invariant in N .

Conley proved that any isolated invariant set admits an index pair [Con78]. We deﬁne
the Conley index of an isolated invariant set S to be the pointed space (N/L, [L]) for an
index pair (N, L). This is denoted I(φ, S ), and its pointed homotopy is independent of the
choice of index pair (although it depends heavily on the choice of S ). If φ is G-equivariant

8

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

for a compact Lie group G acting on X, then a G-invariant index pair can be constructed
[Flo87, Pru99], thus yielding a G-equivariant Conley index, denoted IG(S ).

With this in mind, we are ready to deﬁne the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum. We ﬁx k,
R, and suﬃciently large λ such that Proposition 2.1 applies. We consider the vector ﬁeld
uλ(l + pλc) on W λ, where uλ is a smooth, S1-invariant, cut-oﬀ function on W λ that vanishes
outside of B(3R). This generates the ﬂow φλ that we will work with. Denote by Sλ the
union of all trajectories of φλ inside B(R). Recall from Proposition 2.1 that these are the
same as the trajectories that stay in B(2R). This implies that Sλ is an isolated invariant
set.

Since everything is S1-invariant, we can construct the equivariant Conley index I λ =
IS1(φλ, Sλ). We must de-suspend appropriately to make the stable homotopy type inde-
pendent of λ:

SWF(Y, s, g) = Σ−W (−λ,0)

I λ,

where W (−λ,0) denotes the direct sum of the eigenspaces of l with eigenvalues in the interval
(−λ, 0). As we vary the metric g, the spectrum SWF(Y, s, g) varies by suspending (or de-
suspending) with copies of the vector space C. In [Man03], this indeterminacy is ﬁxed by
introducing a quantity n(Y, s, g) ∈ Q (a linear combination of eta invariants), and setting

SWF(Y, s) = Σ−n(Y,s,g)C SWF(Y, s, g),

where the de-suspension by rational numbers is deﬁned formally. We have:

Theorem 2.3 (Theorem 1 in [Man03]). The S1-equivariant stable homotopy type of SWF(Y, s)
is an invariant of the pair (Y, s).

In this section we prove Theorems 1.1 and 1.4, as well as Corollaries 1.5 and 1.6.

k norms by |G|.

The main idea is that we can follow the constructions of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum

to the pull-backs of the corresponding objects on Y . We can then use this to compare the

Suppose we are under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, with Y and eY being rational
homology spheres, and π : eY → Y a pn-sheeted regular covering, for p prime. Let s be a
We equip Y with a Riemannian metric g. We use eg = π∗g as our choice of metric on eY .
Furthermore, we pull back the spinor bundle S from Y to eY . We ﬁx a ﬂat Spinc connection
A0 on Y and consider its pullback eA0 on eY . In general, we will decorate an object with a
tilde to mean the associated object for eY . Let G denote the deck transformation group on eY .
for eY such that it is a G-spectrum and at each step, the ﬁxed points correspond exactly
Seiberg-Witten Floer spectra of eY and Y .
Let fW denote the Coulomb slice of the conﬁguration space on (eY , π∗ s). The group G
acts on fW by pull-back. Furthermore, since the ﬂat connection on Y pulls back to the
ﬂat connection on eY , π∗ gives an inclusion of W into fW such that W = fW G; being in
an isometric embedding from W into fW . This is because if (a, φ) has L2 norm 1 in W ,
then (π∗(a), π∗(φ)) has L2 norm |G| in fW . In particular, this shows that BW (R), the ball
completion Wk with fW G

in W of radius R, is precisely BfW (|G| · R)G. We then extend this to identify the Sobolev

In particular, the pullback of a ﬁnite-type Seiberg-Witten trajectory on Y in Wk gives a

The linear Fredholm mapel on fW is G-equivariant. The mapel can have more eigenvalues
than l, but in any case any eigenvector of l pulls back to an eigenvector of el, for the same
eigenvalue. Thus, for all λ, we have that W λ = (fW λ)G. We also have thatec is G-equivariant.
G-invariant ﬁnite-type Seiberg-Witten trajectory on eY in fWk. Similarly, the trajectories of
l + pλc on Y pull back to approximate Seiberg-Witten trajectories on eY .

Recall that for suﬃciently large radius RY , all ﬁnite-type Seiberg-Witten trajectories
on Y are inside of BY (RY ). By choosing each radius large enough, we can arrange that
RY = R eY /|G|. In particular, we have that

(fW λ ∩ B eY (2R eY ))G = W λ ∩ BY (2RY ).

We choose λ large enough such that Proposition 2.1 applies to each of RY and R eY on
the respective manifold. To obtain a well-deﬁned ﬂow on W λ, we multiply l + pλc by a
bump function ˜uλ on B eY (3R eY ) which is radially symmetric in the L2
k norm. Note that the

corresponding bump function on BY (3RY ) by restriction. The truncated gradients induce

of all ﬁnite-type trajectories of φλ in W λ ∩ B(2RY ). On fW λ we have a similar isolated
invariant set fS λ. Clearly, ( fS λ)G = S λ.
The ﬂow eφλ is not only S1-equivariant, but also equivariant with respect to the action of
G. Thus, we can choose an (S1 × G)-equivariant index pair (N, L) for fS λ. The ﬁxed point

sets (N G, LG) of the G-action form an S1-invariant index pair for S λ. This implies that

Recall that the invariant set that we use for the Conley index on W λ is S λ, the union

such that SWF(Y, s) and SWF(eY , π∗s) are suitable (de-)suspensions of X and eX, respec-
tively; and moreover, eX comes with an action of the group G (commuting with the S1-
spaces X and eX.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. This follows by applying the classical Smith inequality (1) to the

Proof of Theorem 1.4. All homologies below will be taken with coeﬃcients in Z/pZ.

The variant HFred of Heegaard Floer homology [OS04c] can be described as the quotient
HF −/U N HF − for N ≫ 0. Using the Floer spectrum / monopole Floer / Heegaard Floer
equivalences from (3) and (5), we see that HFred(Y, s) is isomorphic (ignoring absolute
gradings) to

Consider the long exact sequence in Borel homology associated to the pair (X ∧ S(CN )+,

• The space X ∧ S(CN )+ has free S1-action away from the basepoint, so its (reduced)
Borel homology is isomorphic to the ordinary (reduced) homology of the quotient,

• The space X ∧ D(CN )+ is S1-equivalent to X;

eH∗(X ∧S1 S(CN )+);
• Smashing with (cid:0)D(CN )+/S(CN )+(cid:1) ∼ (CN )+ preserves Borel homology (up to a

degree shift by 2N ).

Thus, we can write the long exact sequence as:

· · · → eH∗(X ∧S1 S(CN )+) → eH S1

For N large, multiplication by U N on eH S1

and cokernel isomorphic to HFred(Y, s). Therefore,

dim eH∗(X ∧S1 S(CN )+) = N + 2 dim HFred(Y, s).

Similar arguments apply to eY and eX, giving
Note that the G-ﬁxed point set of eX ∧ S(CN )+ is X ∧ S(CN )+. Applying the classical

Smith inequality to these spaces, together with (12) and (13), yields the desired inequality
(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 1.5. This follows from Theorem 1.4, using the characterization of Z/pZ-
L-spaces in terms of the vanishing of HFred with Z/pZ coeﬃcients.
(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 1.6. This is immediate from Corollary 1.5 and the universal coeﬃcient
theorem.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.1. Apart from Smith-type inequalities, the use of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spec-
trum allows us to deﬁne equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homologies for covering spaces.

Indeed, given a regular cover π : eY → Y between rational homology spheres, with any deck

transformation group G, and equipped with a G-invariant Spinc structure s, we set

SWFH G

∗ (eY , s) = eH G

∗ (SWF(eY , s)),

SWFH G×S1

∗

(eY , s) = eH S1×G

∗

(SWF(eY , s)).

These invariants are modules over the rings H ∗(BG) and H ∗(B(G × S1)) = H ∗(BG)[U ],
respectively.

It is clear that when combined with the following, Corollary 1.3 proves Theorem 1.12.

4. Applications

Proposition 4.1. Let K be a non-trivial knot in S3 and let p, q, p′, q′ be positive, relatively
If p/q ≤ 1 and ⌈q/p⌉ < ⌊q′/p′⌋, then for all primes r and for all s ∈

(14)

dimdHF (S3

p/q(K), s; Z/rZ) < dimdHF (S3

p′/q′(K), s; Z/rZ).

We will establish the desired inequality by applying the formula of Jabuka [Jab15] (based
on that of Ozsv´ath-Szab´o in [OS11]) for the Heegaard Floer homology of p/q-surgery on a
knot K in S3. We ﬁrst recall his notation. The formula will be expressed in terms of two

objects: H∗(bAs), deﬁned in [OS08], which represent the Heegaard Floer homology of large

surgeries on K in certain s structures, and ν(K), a Z-valued invariant deﬁned in [OS11].

While Jabuka’s results are stated with Z-coeﬃcients, the arguments also work for Z/rZ-
coeﬃcients for any prime r; we will omit the coeﬃcients from the notation. We do not need

(i) either ν(K) or ν(−K) is non-negative (where −K denotes the mirror of K),

the deﬁnitions of either bAs or ν, just the following three facts:
(ii) dim H∗(bAs) ≥ 1 for all s,
(iii) dim H∗(bAs) = 1 for all s implies that ν > 0 for any non-trivial knot.

For [i] ∈ Z/pZ and s ∈ Z, let φp/q

[i] (s) = #{n ∈ Z | ⌊ i+p·n

p < 0. It is straightforward to verify that

K in S3. After possibly mirroring K, we can arrange that ν = ν(K) ≥ 0 and if ν > 0,

Proof of Proposition 4.1. To prove the proposition, it suﬃces to mirror the knot K so as to
be in the setting of Theorem 4.2, provided that we additionally prove the inequality

(16)

dimdHF (S3

−p/q(K), s; Z/rZ) < dimdHF (S3

−p′/q′(K), s; Z/rZ).

From now on, we assume the formulas in Theorem 4.2 hold for the knot K.

[i]

(s) < φ−p′/q′

If ⌈q/p⌉ < ⌊q′/p′⌋, we have that φp/q

(s) for all [i], [i′], s by (15).

We begin with the following observation.
φp′/q′
[i′] (s) and φ−p/q
We ﬁrst consider the case that ν = 0. As discussed, this implies that dim H∗(bAs) > 1 for
for all [i], [i′].
[i] < S −p′/q′

some s. Since φp/q
Theorem 4.2 now establishes (14). The same argument applies to show that S −p/q
and hence we obtain (16).

[i] (s) < φp′/q′

[i] < S p′/q′

[i] (s) <

Next, consider the case that ν > 0. We ﬁrst analyze the positive surgeries (p/q, p′/q′).
Since φp/q
for all [i], [i′]. Observe
that we cannot have (2ν −1)q′ ≤ p′ since ⌊q′/p′⌋ > ⌈q/p⌉ by assumption and hence ⌊q′/p′⌋ ≥
2. Therefore, by Theorem 4.2, in order to prove (14), it suﬃces to prove the inequalities

[i′] (s) for all [i], [i′], s, we have that S p/q

[i] (s) < φp′/q′

[i] ≤ S p′/q′

[i′]

[i] (s) < −1 + 2 X|s|<ν

φp′/q′
[i′] (s),

for any [i], [i′]. These follow from (15), since p/q ≤ 1 and ν > 0.

12

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Now, we consider the case of negative surgeries when ν > 0. As before, we have that
[i] ≤ S −p′/q′
S −p/q

for all [i], [i′]. By Theorem 4.2 it suﬃces to establish the inequality

[i′]

1 + 2 X|s|<ν

[i]

(s) < 1 + 2 X|s|<ν

φ−p′/q′
[i′]

for any [i], [i′], which again follows from (15), since p/q ≤ 1 and ν > 0.

(cid:3)

p/q(K) is not hyperbolic, then it cannot cover S3

Remark 4.3. Note that if K is hyperbolic, a variant of Theorem 1.12 can be obtained for
generic p, q, p′, q′ via classical methods as follows. The following argument was shown to us
by John Luecke. First, ﬁx p/q ∈ Q (not necessarily between 0 and 1). For generic p′/q′,
we will have that S3
p′/q′(K) is hyperbolic by Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem.
Thus, if S3
p′/q′ when the latter is hyperbolic.
If instead, S3
p/q(K)) < vol(K). Further, for ﬁxed
ǫ > 0, for p′ and q′ large enough, we have vol(S3
p′/q′(K)) ≥ vol(K)−ǫ; see [NZ85] for explicit
bounds in terms of p′, q′. In particular, we have vol(S3
p′/q′(K)). Recall that
p/q(K)

for hyperbolic manifolds, if eY covers Y , then vol(eY ) ≥ vol(Y ). Thus, we have that S3

p/q(K) is hyperbolic, then we have vol(S3

p/q(K)) < vol(S3

cannot cover S3

p′/q′(K).

Alternatively, we could ﬁx p′/q′, and allow p/q to vary. Fix δ > 0. For generic p/q, we
p/q(K) is at most δ. We thus choose p/q
p/q(K) is less than the length of the shortest
p/q(K) cannot cover S3
p′/q′(K), since if γ was
p′/q′(K) with
p′/q′(K)

have that the length of the shortest geodesic in S3
such that the length of the shortest geodesic in S3
geodesic in S3
p′/q′(K). We see that in this case S3
the shortest geodesic, its projection to S3
the same length. Thus, we would have that the length of the shortest geodesic in S3
is at most that of S3

p′/q′(K) determines a geodesic in S3

p/q(K), which is a contradiction.

Note that in either setting, we did not need any assumptions on the type of covering.

Using a similar argument to the one for Theorem 1.12, we can also prove Theorem 1.16.

Proof of Theorem 1.16. If p/q ≥ 2g(K) − 1, then S3
Since K is non-trivial, we have

p/q(K) is a Z/rZ-L-space by [Hom11].

1 ≤ 2g(K) − 1 = (2g(K) − 1)⌈q/p⌉ < (2g(K ′) − 1)⌊q′/p′⌋ < (2g(K ′) − 1)q′/p′,

and thus p′/q′ < 2g(K ′)−1. Therefore, S3
p′/q′(K ′) is not a Z/rZ-L-space by [KMOS07]. The
result now follows from Corollary 1.5. Therefore, we now assume that 0 < p/q < 2g(K) − 1.

It is well-known that for a non-trivial Z/rZ-L-space knot, dim H∗(bAs) = 1 for all s. In

this case, ν = g(K) [OS11, Proposition 9.7]. Therefore, since K and K ′ are L-space knots,
we have S p/q
[i′] = 0 for both K and K ′. Therefore, by Theorem 4.2, to establish the
result it suﬃces to show that

[i] = S p′/q′

X|s|<g(K)

φp/q

[i] (s) < X|s|<g(K ′)

φp′/q′
[i′] (s).

By our assumptions on p/q, p′/q′, g(K), g(K ′), and by (15), we have

X|s|<g(K)

φp/q

[i] (s) ≤ (2g(K) − 1)⌈q/p⌉ < (2g(K ′) − 1)⌊q′/p′⌋ ≤ X|s|<g(K ′)

φp′/q′
[i′] (s).

We end with another application of the same techniques.

Corollary 4.4. Let K be any alternating or Montesinos knot other than the pretzel knots
±P (−2, 3, 2s + 1) for any positive s ≥ 3 or a torus knot. Then, for any p′/q′ ≥ 9,
p′/q′(P (−2, 3, 7)) is not an rn-sheeted regular cover of S3
S3
p/q(K) for any p/q ∈ Q and prime

p/q(K) is not a Z/rZ-L-
p′/q′(P (−2, 3, 7)) is an L-space for p′/q′ ≥ 9. Now apply

1The arguments in [BM14] for non-pretzel Montesinos knots work for any coeﬃcients. The arguments in
[LM13] for pretzel knots are given over Z/2Z, because for one knot, the knot Floer homology needs to be
computed over Z/2Z. However, one can deduce from the calculation using universal coeﬃcients and [OS05a]
that that knot cannot be a Z/rZ-L-space knot for any r.
