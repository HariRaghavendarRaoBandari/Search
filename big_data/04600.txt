Gradient Lq theory for a class of nondiagonal elliptic systems

Miroslav Bul´ıˇcek, Martin Kalousek, Petr Kaplick´y, V´aclav M´acha

March 16, 2016

Abstract

We show that the new result on H¨older continuity of solutions to a class of nondiagonal elliptic systems

with p-growth in [2] can be used to improve the Lq theory for such systems.

1 Introduction

This paper focuses on global Lq estimates for a class of elliptic PDE’s corresponding to the Euler operator
of the following variational integral

J(u) =ZΩ

F (x,∇u) − G : ∇u,

(1)

with some coercive Caratheodory function F : Ω × Rd×N → R+. Here, Ω denotes an open bounded domain
in Rd with Lipschitz boundary, G is a given matrix function and u is an RN -valued function. The Euler
operator of (1) has the form

Lu = − div Fη(x,∇u),

(2)

where we set

Fη(x, η) :=

∂F (x, η)

∂η

: Ω × Rd×N → Rd×N .

We study the local properties of a weak solution u ∈ W 1,p(Ω; RN ) of the following Euler equations

corresponding to the variational problem (1)

Lu = − div G in Ω,

with L given by (2) and with some given boundary data v ∈ W 1,p(Ω; RN ).

We assume that for all x ∈ Ω F (x,·) ∈ C2(Rd×N ), for all η ∈ Rd×N F (·, η) is measurable and

α0(|η|2 + δ0)

· (ξ ⊗ ξ) ≤ α1(|η|2 + δ0)

p−2

2 |ξ|2

for all η, ξ ∈ Rd×N . This assumption is suﬃcient for ﬁnding the unique weak solution to (21).

Further we assume

α0(δ0 + |η|2)

p−2

2 |η|2 ≤ Fη(x, η) · η ≤ C(F (x, η) + 1)

for all η ∈ Rd×N .

|Fη(x, η)| ≤ C(δ0 + |η|2)

The second and the most restrictive assumption, we assume here, is that F satisﬁes a splitting condition1
up to a lower order term. It means we assume that there are symmetric matrix-valued function A : Ω ×
Rd×N → RN×N , a symmetric matrix valued b : Ω → Rd×d and a matrix-valued function G : Ω × Rd×N →
Rd×N such that

for all η ∈ Rd×N , all i = 1, . . . , d, all α = 1, . . . , N and a.a. x ∈ Ω. Observe that (9) is an additional structure
condition which does not reﬂect the fact, that the Fηα
i come from a potential. Moreover, we require that for
all µ ∈ RN , all η ∈ Rd×N , all v ∈ Rd and a.a. x ∈ Ω there holds

Throughout this paper we work with Orlicz function ϕ with ϕ′(t) = (δ0 + |t|2)

2 t. We have ϕ′′(t) =
(δ0 + t2)(p−4)/2(δ0 + (p − 2)t2) so ϕ clearly satisﬁes [5, Assumption 1]. We denote by ϕ∗ its complementary
[5]). In order to simplify estimates we introduce the function V (A) = (δ0 + |A|2)(p−2)/4A
function (see cf.
for A ∈ Rd×N . With this notation we get from (5) and (6)

It holds

see [5, (2.3)] and [5, Lemma 3] gives

ϕ∗(ϕ′(|η|)) ∼ ϕ(|η|) ∼ |V (η)|2

∃c, C > 0,∀A, B ∈ Rd×N : c|V (A) − V (B)|2 ≤ ϕ′′(|A| + |B|)|A − B|2 ≤ C|V (A) − V (B)|2.

There is α > 1, C > 0 such that for all R ∈ (0, 1) and t > 0 the estimate

From [5, Lemma 31].

Moreover from (4) it follows that for all η, ξ ∈ Rd×N , x ∈ Ω

ϕ∗(Rt) ≤ CRαϕ∗(t).

(Fη(x, η) − Fη(x, ξ)) · (η − ξ) ≥ C|V (η) − V (ξ)|2,

compare [5, proof of Lemma 21].

Our main result is summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem 1. Let p ∈ (1,∞), F satisfy (4)–(10). There is q0 > p+ 2 and R0 > 0 such that if G ∈ Lq/(p−1)
for some q ∈ (p, q0) and v is a solution to (3). Then v ∈ W 1,q
R ∈ (0, R0)

The constants R0, c may depend on q0, F but are independent of G, v, Q, q.
The number q0 can be chosen in interval (p, p + 2/(1 − α)) where α ∈ (0, 1) appears in Theorem 5.

Nonlinear Calderon-Zygmund theory have its roots in articles [8] and [7]. In [3] the method is presented
that somehow separates arguments from function theory and theory of partial diﬀerential equations. The
method is however not applicable to PDE’s with right hand side and in the situation that only low regularity
of comparison problem is available. To this situation the approach was carefully developed in [9, Section 7].
The functional analytic lemma that treats Lq just as a property of a function was formulated in [10]. In our
article we use it to prove gradient Lq estimates for a class of nondiagonal elliptic systems with p-growth.
This class is characterized by the fact that the elliptic term satisﬁes a splitting condition. H¨older continuity
of solutions proved in [2] allows us extend the range of q′s for which the estimates hold in comparison to [9].

2.1 Local Lq regularity result

It is based on a local

comparison of a given solution with a solution to a suitably chosen approximative problem. The method was
further developed and clearly described in [3]. In this article the authors deal with the interior Lq theory
in the situation that for the approximative problem an W 1,∞ local estimates are available. A suggestion
appears also in this article what to do in the case that one can obtain for the approximative problem interior
W 1,q0 estimates, q0 < +∞ only. This situation is investigated (among other regularity results) in [9].
For a cube Q and α > 0 we deﬁne a cube αQ as a cube with the same center as Q whose edges are parallel
and have length α times length of edges of Q. Furthermore, for a dyadic cube Qk we denote its predecessor
by ˜Qk. This notation is eﬀective throughout the paper. The proof of the main theorem is based on the
following lemma.

Lemma 2. Let 1 ≤ r < s < t < ∞, Q ⊂ O be a cube and Qk be dyadic cubes obtained from Q. Further, let
f ∈ Ls(4Q) and w ∈ Lr(4Q)n. Then there exists ε0 > 0 independent of Q such that the following implication
holds:
If there exists ε ∈ (0, ε0) such that for every dyadic cube Qk ⊂ Q, Qk 6= Q there exists wa ∈ Lp(4 ˜Qk)n

with following properties:

then w ∈ Ls(Q)n. Positive constants C and ε are independent on Qk, wa and w.
Furthermore, there exists a positive constant c independent of f , g and w such that

The proof relays on considerations presented in [3] in the situation f = 0. In this work, the lemma is also
closely connected to systems of partial diﬀerential equations. The same technique was used in [9] to show
Lq theory for more general systems compared to systems considered here with f 6= 0 up to the boundary.
Since the problem is more general, authors have worse estimates for the comparison problem which results
in smaller range of q’s for which the theory holds. In [4] the method was used to generalized Stokes problem
with f 6= 0. The ﬁrst occurrence of the lemma in the form independent of diﬀerential equations is probably
in [10]. Since the proof of Lemma 3 is a modiﬁcation of the one in [3] and [10] we skip it in this article.

2.2 Comparison problem and its estimates

2.2.1 The comparison problem

To apply Lemma 2 we need to construct for a given solution of (3) a function wa with properties (17),(18)
and (19). When studying the elliptic systems of equations such a function is usually found as a solution to
a suitable approximative system. It is the same in our situation.

Let us assume that we have a local solution v ∈ W 1,p(Ω; RN ) of the problem (3). Hereinafter, Q0 ⊂ Ω
We consider a comparison problem

will be an arbitrary but ﬁxed cube with the centre x0, such that Q0 ⊂ U (x0, 1).

div Fη(x0,∇u) = 0 in Q0,
u = v on ∂Q0

(21)

Existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to this problem follows by theory of monotone operators due
to Assumption (4). It was applied for example in [4] Lemma 3.1 to a similar problem motivated by ﬂuid
mechanics, with an additional constraint div u = 0 in Q0.

We formulate the result in the next lemma.

Lemma 3. Let v ∈ W 1,p(Ω) be a local weak solution to (3). Then there is a unique weak solution u ∈
W 1,p(Q0) to the problem (21).

Moreover,

∃C > 0 :ZQ0 |V (∇u)|2 ≤ CZQ0 |V (∇v)|2,

∀κ > 0,∃Cκ > 0 :ZQ0 |V (∇u) − V (∇v)|2 ≤ZQ0

Cκϕ∗(|G|) + (κ + CRα)|V (∇v)|2.

The constants C, Cκ are independent of u, v, Q0, x0.

(22)

(23)

Proof. We skip the proof of existence and of uniqueness since it follows line by line [4, Lemma 3.1].

Also the proofs of estimates (22) and (23) are very similar, but since here the eliptic operator L in (2)

depends on x we present it here. Let us start by testing (21) by u − v to get
ZQ0 |V (∇u)|2 ≤ cZQ0

Fη(x0,∇u)∇u = cZQ0

Fη(x0,∇u)∇v

≤ δZQ0

ϕ∗(|Fη(x0,∇u)|) + CδZQ0

ϕ(|∇v|).

From (11) and (12) we get

ZQ0 |V (∇u)|2 ≤ δZQ0 |V (∇u)|2 + CδZQ0 |V (∇v)|2,

i.e. (22).

We subtract the weak formulation of (21) from (3) and test the result by u − v extended by zero outside

Q0 in order to get

ZQ0

(Fη(x0,∇u) − Fη(x,∇v))(∇u − ∇v) =ZQ0
ϕ∗(|G|) + κZQ0

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (25) can be handled as

+ZQ0

(Fη(x0,∇u) − Fη(x0,∇v))(∇u − ∇v)

ϕ(|∇u|) + δZQ0

ϕ(|∇v|)≤(CRα + κ)ZQ0 |V (∇v)|2,

where we used (8), Young’s inequality, (22) and (14) with (12).

We estimate the second term on the right hand side of (25) by (15) from below as
(Fη(x0,∇u) − Fη(x0,∇v))(∇u − ∇v) ≥ C|V (∇u) − V (∇v)|2.

Putting these estimates into (24) and (25) we get (23).

2.2.2 Known estimates for approximative solution

In further estimates we denote by dhf diﬀerences of a function f in the direction h ∈ Rd.

Proof. We follow the proof of [5, Theorem 11] that deals with a more complicated situation where the elliptic
term depends also on x.

Let us choose Q as in the statement of the lemma, θ ∈ C∞C (2Q), χQ ≤ θ≤ χ2Q, |∇θ| ≤ c

R . Let us choose

h, s ∈ Rd \ {0}, |s| ≤ |h| ≤ R. We apply ds to (21) and obtain for any w ∈ W 1,p

We obtain

Then we apply [5, Lemma 13] as in the proof of [5, Theorem 11] to obtain

R2 Z20Q |V (∇u)|2.

We divide this inequality by |h|2 and use the characterization of Sobolev spaces via diﬀerence quotients to
conclude (26).

A simple covering argument gives the statement.

Now we use only recently proved further local estimates to u. In [2] the following theorem appears.

Theorem 5. Let p ∈ (1,∞) and F satisfy (4)–(10). Then there exists α > 0 such that the unique weak
solution u to (21) belongs to Cα

loc(Q0; RN ). Moreover, for all Q ⊂ Q0 we have the estimate

In addition, there exists C > 0 such that for all x0 ∈ Q0 and all ε > 0 the solution u satisﬁes the following
potential inequality

Let now Q ⊂ 6√dQ ⊂ Q0 be a cube with sidelength R. Previous inequality together with the integral

Let ε > 0 be small, then (32) follows from (33) and (36) with integration on the right hand side over a
multiple of 2Q. Simple covering argument gives the statement.

In (32) we proved a reverse H¨older inequality which could be improved by Gehring’s theorem. Here we
proceed in a diﬀerent way and trace the dependence of integrability of (δ0 +|∇u|2)1/2 on the constant α from
Theorem 5.
In the following part of the paper, estimates in Nikolskii spaces N λ,p appear. The deﬁnition and basic
properties of these spaces can be found in [11, Chapter 4] where they are denoted Bλ
p,∞(Ω). Here we call
them N λ,p(Ω). We recall the deﬁnition of these spaces in a special case for reader’s convenience. Several
equivalent deﬁnitions can be found in [11, Theorem 4.2.2/2]. Let Q ⊂ Rd be a cube with sidelength R > 0.
Let p ∈ [1,∞], λ ∈ (0, 1). For h ∈ Rd, h 6= 0 we denote Qh = {x ∈ Q; x + h ∈ Q}. Then we deﬁne the space
N λ,p as

N λ,p(Q) = {w ∈ Lp(Q); [w]N λ,p(Q) < ∞},

The lemma is proved under additional assumption q < p∗ and with a larger integration domain on the right
hand side. Using (42) in (41) allows to increase the validity of the lemma for q ∈ [p, min(p∗∗, (2 + p(1 −
α))/(1 − α)). The statement of the lemma is obtained after ﬁnite number of iterations and an application of
a simple covering argument.

Now we prove the same result as in Lemma 8 also in the case p < 2. It will need some preparations.

Unfortunately, we do not know the method that would work in both cases.
Lemma 2.1. Let Q ⊂ Rd be a cube with sidelength R > 0, 1 < p ≤ r < 2 and w ∈ W 2,p(5Q). Then for all

The constant C may depend on q.

Proof. We will proceed by iterations. We assume that (44) holds for some q (this is always true for q = p) and
show that if q < p + 2/(1 − α) than (44) holds also with q replaced by γ ∈ (q, 2q(2 − α)/(2 − p + q)/(1 − α)).
Since 2q(2 − α)/(2 − p + q)/(1 − α) − q is a positive and continuous function of q on [p, p + 2/(1 − α)) the
statement (44) follows.
Let us now assume that (44) holds and show that this estimate continues to hold if we replace q with
γ ∈ (q, 2q(2 − α)/(2 − p + q)/(1 − α)). Note that this interval is nonempty. Let us set r = 2q/(2 − p + q).
Let us note that if q ∈ [p, 2) then r belongs to [p, +∞) and r ≤ q for q ≥ p. The coeﬃcient r is set in such a
way that r(2 − p)/(2 − r) = q.

Lemma 2.1 with this choice of r applied to u gives together with Lemma 4

similarly as at the end of Lemma 8. The statement of the lemma follows by covering argument.

Now we may proceed to the proof of the main result.

3 The proof

Proof of Theorem 1. The statement of the theorem follows from Lemma 2 applied to w = (δ0 + |∇v|2)p/4.
Let us now verify its assumption. We ﬁx Q0 ⊂ Ω. Consider the solution to the problem (21) and set
wa = (δ0 +|∇v|2)p/4, f = ϕ∗(|G|)1/2, r = 2, t ∈ (2, 2 + 4/(p− αp). The inequality (18) follows from (22) just
by considering the deﬁnition of V . Similarly we also get (17) from (38) or (44). Clearly, (19) should follow
from (23). Its right hand side corresponds to the right hand side of (19) so it remains to show

∀A, B ∈ Rd×N : |(δ0 + |A|2)

Combining this with (47) and (13) gives (46). The inequality (19) is proved provided κ + CRα < ǫ0, ǫ0 being
from Lemma 2. At this moment we obtain restriction on R0. Consequently, Lemma 2 gives for any q such
that s := 2q/p ∈ (r, t)
