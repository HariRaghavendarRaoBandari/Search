Abstract. The aim of this short note is to explain how the arguments of the
“closing lemma with time control” of F. Abdenur and S. Crovisier [AC12] can
be used to answer Question 1 of the article “Instability for the rotation set of
homeomorphisms of the torus homotopic to the identity” of S. Addas-Zanata
[AZ04].

In this short note, we explain how to get a C1 version of a perturbation result
of the rotation set of homeomorphisms of the torus homotopic to the identity, ob-
tained by S. Addas-Zanata in [AZ04]: consider some diﬀeomorphism f of the torus,
isotopic to the identity, and suppose that some extreme point (t, ω) of the rotation
set of f has at least one irrational coordinate. Then there exists a perturbation
g of f, which is arbitrarily C1-close to f, such that the rotation set of g contains
some vector that was not in the rotation set of f.

We will use the notations of [AZ04]. Let us recall the most useful ones: we
will denote T2 = R2/Z2 the ﬂat torus. The space D1(T2) will be the set of
C1-diﬀeomorphism of the torus T2 homotopic to the identity, endowed with the
classical C1 topology on compact spaces; D1(R2) will be the set of lifts to the
plane of elements of D1(T2). Given ˜f ∈ D1(R2), its rotation set will be deﬁed as

(cid:110) ˜f n(˜x) − ˜x

| ˜x ∈ R2(cid:111)

the rotation vector of the segment of orbit ˜x, ˜f (˜x),··· , ˜f n(˜x), and when it is well
deﬁned (for example for a periodic point),

ρ(˜x, ˜f ) = lim

n→+∞ ρ(˜x, n, ˜f ).

We will also consider ω a volume or a symplectic form on T2, whose lift to R2 will
also be denoted by ω.

We will prove the following result.

Theorem 1. Let ˜f ∈ D1(R2) be such that ρ( ˜f ) has an extremal point (t, ω) /∈ Q2.
Then there exists ˜g ∈ D1(R2), arbitrarily C1-close to f, such that ρ(˜g)∩ ρ( ˜f )
(cid:123) (cid:54)= ∅
(and in particular, ρ(˜g) (cid:54)= ρ( ˜f )).

Moreover, if ˜f preserves ω, then ˜g can be supposed to preserve it too.

Figure 1. If the rotation vector of the initial orbit (in black) is in {L > 0}, then
the rotation vector of one of the two pseudo orbits (in red and in blue) too.

We will prove this theorem by replacing the C0 perturbation result of [AZ04] by
a closing lemma in topology C1, obtained by adapting the arguments of Theorem 6
of [AC12].
Lemma 2 (Closing lemma with rotation control). Let ˜f ∈ D1(T2), L : R2 → R a
non-trivial aﬃne form, and V a C1-neighbourhood of f. Then, there exists N ∈ N
such that for every non-periodic point x of f, there exists a neighbourhood V of x

such that if n ≥ N and y ∈ V are such that f n(y) ∈ V and L(cid:0)ρ(˜y, n, ˜f )(cid:1) > 0, then
there exists g ∈ V such that y is a periodic point1 of g satisfying L(cid:0)ρ(˜y, ˜g)(cid:1) > 0.
the dichotomy “L(cid:0)ρ(˜x, n, ˜f )(cid:1) > 0 / L(cid:0)ρ(˜x, n, ˜f )(cid:1) ≤ 0”. More precisely, the proof

The idea of the proof of this lemma is identical to that of Theorem 6 of [AC12],
by replacing the dichotomy “(cid:96) divides / does not divide the length of the orbit” by

Moreover, if f preserves ω, then g can be supposed to preserve it too.

of the connecting lemma of S. Hayashi [Hay97] builds a “closable” pseudo-orbit2
from a recurrent orbit of f, by making shortcuts in this orbit; each time such a
shortcut is performed there are two possibilities of creating a new pseudo-orbit
(see Figure 1). If the initial orbit belongs to the set {L(ρ) > 0}, then at least one
of these two new pseudo-orbits also belongs to the set {L(ρ) > 0} (as the rotation
vector of the initial orbit is a barycentre of the two new ones)3.
Proof of Lemma 2. Simply remark that Proposition 4 of [AC12] still holds when

is replaced by the condition

3. The periodic pseudo-orbit4 (y1,··· , yn = y0) satisﬁes L(cid:0) ˜yn−˜y0

(cid:1) > 0.

The rest of the proof is identical to Section 3.3.1 of [AC12].

(cid:3)
We now explain how this connecting lemma with rotation control can be applied
to adapt the proof of Theorem 1 of [AZ04] to the C1 case. Let us quickly recall
the main arguments of the proof in the C0 case. As the rotation set is convex
[MZ89], there exists a supporting line of ρ( ˜f ) at (t, ω), in other words an aﬃne

1Note that in general, this period is diﬀerent from n.
2A pseudo-orbit is called closable if Pugh’s algebraic lemma (Lemma 4 of [AC12], see also
[Pug67]) can be applied simultaneously to every jump of the pseudo-orbit, to make it become a
real orbit.

3This corresponds to the initial argument of [AC12]: “If (cid:96) does not divide the length of the
initial orbit, then it also does not divides the length of at least one of these two new pseudo-orbits”.
4To be rigorous here, pseudo-orbits must be considered in the cover R2 and perturbations of

diﬀeormorphisms performed in T2.

map L : R2 → R such that L(t, ω) = 0 and L(v) ≤ 0 for every v ∈ ρ( ˜f ). Thus, if
we build g close to f such that there exists v ∈ ρ(˜g) satisfying L(v) > 0, then we
are done.
The ergodic theorem implies the existence of a point x0 ∈ T2 which is recur-
rent for f and such that ρ(˜x0, ˜f ) = (t, ω). At this point there are two possibil-
ities. Either there exists n arbitrarily large such that f n(x0) is close to x0 and

L(ρ(˜x0, n, ˜f )(cid:1) > 0; in this case it suﬃces to apply a C0 closing lemma to x0 and
to x, we have L(ρ(˜x0, n, ˜f )(cid:1) ≤ 0. This case is a bit more complicated: we be-
gin by proving that in this case, it is possible to suppose that L(ρ(˜x0, n, ˜f )(cid:1) < 0
L(n1ρ(˜x0, n1, ˜f )(cid:1) is arbitrarily close to 0. A calculation shows that in this case,
L(cid:0)ρ( ˜f n0(˜x0), n1 − n0, ˜f )(cid:1) > 0: the rotation vector of the segment of orbit between

(Lemma 3 of [AZ04]). Let n0 be such a number (large enough); a theorem of re-
currence of G. Atkinson [Atk76] implies the existence of a time n1 (cid:29) n0 such that

f n(x0) to get the theorem. Or for every n large enough such that f n(x0) is close

˜f n0(˜x0) and ˜f n1(˜x0) belongs to {L > 0}. It then suﬃces to apply the C0 closing
lemma to ˜f n0(˜x0) and ˜f n1(˜x0).
Proof of Theorem 1. Let ˜f ∈ D1(R2) be such that ρ( ˜f ) has an extremal point
(t, ω) /∈ Q2, and V a C1-neighbourhood of f. We ﬁx once for all a lift ˜f of f,
and choose L : R2 → R an aﬃne form such that L(t, ω) = 0 and L(v) ≤ 0 for
every v ∈ ρ( ˜f ). Let x0 ∈ T2 be a recurrent point of f such that ρ(˜x0, ˜f ) = (t, ω).
Lemma 2 gives us a number N ∈ N and a neighbourhood V of x0. The proof
of Theorem 1 of [AZ04] summarized in the previous discussion gives us a point
y = f n0(x0) (with n0 possibly equal to 0) and a time n1 ≥ N such that ˜f n1(˜y) ∈ V

and L(cid:0)ρ(˜y, n1, ˜f )(cid:1) > 0. Applying Lemma 2, we get g ∈ V such that y is a periodic
point of g satisfying L(cid:0)ρ(˜y, ˜g)(cid:1) > 0. This proves the theorem.

Moreover, if f preserves ω, then g can be supposed to preserve it too.

(cid:3)
Remark 3. Theorem 1 of [AZ04] is also true in the C0 measure-preserving case.
To see it, it suﬃces to replace the C0 closing lemma by the measure-preserving
one (see for example Lemma 13 of [OU41]).
