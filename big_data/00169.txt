Abstract—This paper aims to solve the energy efﬁciency (EE)
maximization problem for multicast services in a multiple-
input single-output (MISO) distributed antenna system (DAS).
A novel iterative algorithm is proposed, which consists of solving
two subproblems iteratively: the power allocation problem and
the beam direction updating problem. The former subproblem
can be equivalently transformed into a one-dimension quasi-
concave problem that is solved by the golden search method.
The latter problem can be efﬁciently solved by the existing
method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
achieves signiﬁcant EE performance gains over the existing rate
maximization method. In addition, when the backhaul power
consumption is low, the EE performance of the DAS is better
than that of the centralized antenna system (CAS).

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, distributed antenna system (DAS),

large-scale
MIMO (LS-MIMO), cloud radio access networks (CRANs)
and Heterogeneous networks (Hets) have been regarded as
promising techniques to meet the ﬁfth generation (5G) re-
quirements of cellular networks [1]. In this paper, our focus
is on the DAS. While in the LS-MIMO system, all antennas
are deployed in the same geographical location, which causes
correlation among the antennas’ signals [2], in a DAS, remote
access units (RAUs) are located at different places, and each
RAU is connected to the central processing unit (CPU) through
optical ﬁbers. Through distributed implementation, both the
average access distance for the users and the correlations of
the antennas can be signiﬁcantly reduced. In addition, DAS
usually operates on the per-macrocell basis, which means that
the RAUs in each macrocell serve the users in its own cell
and signals from other macrocells are regarded as interference.
Compared with Hets, where interference management is very
challenging especially for dense Hets [3], in the DAS, the
interference from different RAUs in the same macrocell can
be efﬁciently handled due to the fact that different RAUs
in each macrocell cooperate with each other for transmis-
sion. Compared with the small-scale interference coordination
offered by the DAS, large-scale interference coordination is
possible in CRANs, where all base stations (BSs) from a large
geographical area are connected to the same computing center

via fronthaul links, and base-band processing for the multiple
BSs are done jointly at the computing center to cancel inter-
cell interference. Some technical challenges for CRAN include
the large delays on the fronthaul links and the large amount
of overhead and information to enable large-scale interference
cancelation [4].

On the other hand, energy efﬁciency (EE), measured in
bit/Hz/Joule, has attracted extensive attention [5], and will
become one of the main concerns in 5G networks [1]. Most
of the existing papers focus on the EE design for unicast
services in DAS [6]–[8]. With the increasing demand for video
conferences and online games, multicast services should be
supported by future networks. Unlike the unicast services, in
a multicast system, all users receive the same service data,
and therefore, the data rate is determined by the user with the
worst channel gains. Simulation results in [9] showed that the
DAS can offer a uniform rate distribution over the cell region.
Existing EE design methods proposed for unicast services are
no longer applicable for multicast services, and there is no
study on the EE design for multicast services in DAS.

In this paper, we consider the EE maximization problem for
the MISO multicast DAS. A novel iterative algorithm is pro-
posed to solve the EE maximization problem. In each iteration,
two subproblems are solved: the power allocation problem
and the beam direction updating problem. By constructing a
one-dimension optimization problem that is equivalent to the
ﬁrst subproblem, we utilize the golden search method to ﬁnd
the solution. The second subproblem is quadratically quadratic
programming (QCQP). We adopt an existing technique [10] to
solve this subproblem efﬁciently. We also analyze the conver-
gence and complexity of the iterative algorithm. Simulation
results show that
the proposed algorithm outperforms the
existing methods in terms of the EE performance.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a multicast DAS with N RAUs and K single-
antenna users, where RAU n is equipped with Mn antennas,
n = 1, 2, . . . , N, as shown in Fig.1. All users receive the same
data from all the RAUs. Assume that all RAUs are connected
to the central processing unit (CPU) through the high speed
ﬁber cable and all RAUs are fully controlled by the CPU. Let
N = {1,··· , N}, K = {1,··· , K} be the sets of RAUs and
users, respectively. The received signal of the kth user is

A. Algorithm to Solve Problem (P2)

In this subsection, we present an algorithm to solve Problem
(P2) that will be used in step 2) of the EEMT algorithm.
Obviously, Problem (P2) is non-convex, so it is difﬁcult to
solve it directly. In the following, we construct a tractable
optimization problem that is equivalent to Problem (P2).

Note that though the problem in (5) and Problem (P3) look
similar, they are not equivalent. The optimizing variables for
the problem in (5) are real scalars {pn, n ∈ N}, while that for
Problem (P3) are complex vectors {wn,∀n}. The problem in
(5) is a linear programming problem and the globally optimal
solution can be efﬁciently obtained. The following lemma
shows the convexity of f (t).

Lemma 1: f (t) is a convex function of t.
Proof : Denote power allocation {pn,∀n} as an N-vector
P, i.e., P = [p1,··· , pN ]T . Let P(cid:63)

solution to the problem in (5) with t = t1 and t = t2,

The EE of the multicast DAS system is deﬁned as the ratio
of the worst-case user rate to the total power consumption,
measured in bit/Hz/Joule. Our objective is to optimize all the
beam-vectors at the RAUs to maximize the EE of the DAS
system, subject to both the per-RAU power constraints and
the worst-case user rate requirement. The EE maximization
problem can be formulated as

III. ONE NOVEL ALGORITHM TO SOLVE PROBLEM (P1)
In this section, we focus on the solution of the original
problem (P1). Since (P1) is not a convex problem, it’s hard
to ﬁnd its optimal solution. To solve it, we propose a novel
iterative algorithm with two steps.

In the ﬁrst step, the power allocation solution on the beam-
vectors is solved with ﬁxed beam directions. By introducing
an auxiliary variable t, Problem (P1) can be reformulated as

According to Lemma 1, f (t) is a convex function of t.
Moreover, log2(1 + t) is a strictly concave function of t.
Hence, the objective function of (P4) is a strictly quasi-concave
function of t [13]. Then Problem (P4) has a unique globally
optimal solution [13]. The following lemma establishes the
equivalence between Problem (P4) and Problem (P2).

contradicts the fact that t∗ is the globally optimal solution of

Problem (P4). Thus, the lemma follows.
Since Problem (P4) is strictly quasi-concave, the golden
section search method [14] can be used to ﬁnd the optimal

programming problem (5) with t = t∗. The algorithm to ﬁnd

Obviously, Problem (P3) is a QCQP problem and the ﬁrst set
of the constraints are non-convex. As proved in [10], Problem
(P3) is NP-hard. Similar to [10], we use the SDP relaxation
and Gaussian randomization method to solve Problem (P3).

D. Complexity Analysis of the EETM Algorithm

In each iteration of Algorithm 2,

In each iteration, two subproblems, i.e., Problems (P2) and
(P3), are solved. In the following, we analyze the complexity
to solve these two subproblems, respectively.
the rang of (b − a)
will be scaled by 0.618,
the above algorithm will stop
after (cid:100)log(ε/(tmax − tmin))/log 0.618(cid:101) iterations, where (cid:100)·(cid:101)
denotes the ceiling operator. In each iteration, the computation
complexity of the linear programming problem is O(N 3(N +
2K)) [15]. Hence, the total complexity to solve Problem (P2)
is O((cid:100)log(ε/(tmax − tmin))/log 0.618(cid:101)(N 3(N + 2K))).

The complexity of solving Problem (P3) mainly comes from
solving the semideﬁnite programming problem at a complexity
cost that is at most O((K + N 2)3.5) [10].

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have studied the EE optimization problem
for multicast services in MISO DAS, where both the per-
RAU power constraints and the worst-case rate requirement
are taken into account. We provide a novel iterative algorithm
to solve the original EE optimization problem, which consists
of solving two subproblems: the power allocation problem
and the beam direction updating problem. Though the power
allocation problem is non-convex, we construct an equivalent
problem consisting of a linear programming problem and
a quasi-concave problem. The convergence of the iterative
algorithm is proved. Simulation results show that our proposed
algorithm converges rapidly. Furthermore, when the backhaul
power consumption is low, the EE performance of the DAS is
better than that of the CAS, indicating that to achieve the best
EE performance, the antennas should be placed in a distributed
way.

˜hn,k represents the small scale fading that is assumed to be
zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distributed
vector with identity covariance matrix. The noise power is
assumed to be -101 dBm. We assume M (cid:44) Mn = 4,
n = Pmax,∀n, pc = 29 dBm, p0 = 30 dBm.

We ﬁrst study the convergence behaviour of the EETM algo-
rithm. Fig. 2 illustrates the EE versus the number of iterations
of the EETM algorithm under various power constraints when
Pbh = 0. It is seen from this ﬁgure that the EE monotonically
increases and converges rapidly, which conﬁrms the theoretical
result of Lemma 3. Note that only one iteration is sufﬁcient for
the algorithm to converge, which makes our algorithm suitable
for practical applications.

We compare our proposed EETM algorithm (label as ‘DAS
with EE Max’) with the following methods: the worst-case rate
maximization for DAS (labeled as ‘DAS with Rate Max’),
EE maximization for the centralized antenna system (CAS)
where all antennas are placed at the center of the cell (label
as ‘CAS with EE Max’) and the worst-case rate maximization
for CAS (labeled as ‘CAS with Rate Max’). For fairness,
we assume that the maximum transmit power at the CAS is
equal to N Pmax, the number of antennas at the CAS is N M.
Moreover, the total circuit power consumption is assumed to
be N pc + N M p0.

Fig. 3 shows the EE under different power constraints
for various methods. It can be seen from this ﬁgure that
in the regime of low power constraint, the EE achieved by
the method aiming for the worst-case rate maximization is
almost
the same as that achieved by the method aiming
for the EE maximization, meaning that full transmit power
should be used to achieve the maximum worst-case rate and
EE in this regime. However,
in the high transmit power
regime, the EE achieved by the EE-oriented method stays
constant, but the EE corresponding to the worst-case rate-
oriented method decreases signiﬁcantly. This is due to the fact
that the increase of the worst-case rate cannot compensate for
the negative effect of the increase of the transmit power. As
expected, the EE performance of the DAS decreases with the
backhaul power consumption parameter Pbh. If Pbh is low,
ignoring signaling overhead and assuming perfect backhaul,
the EE performance of the DAS is better than that of the
CAS, meaning that to achieve the best EE performance, the
antennas should be placed in a distributed way. However, if
the parameter Pbh is large, the EE performance of the DAS
is inferior to that of the CAS. A more meaningful comparison
between the EE of the DAS and the CAS considering signaling
overhead, backhaul availability, capacity and latency etc. is
part of the future work.
