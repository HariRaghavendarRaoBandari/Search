Charge transfer and electron-phonon coupling in monolayer FeSe on Nb doped SrTiO3

Department of Physics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA

Yuanjun Zhou and Andrew J. Millis

(Dated: March 10, 2016)

Monolayer ﬁlms of FeSe grown on SrTiO3 substrates are electron doped relative to bulk and ex-
hibit a signiﬁcantly higher superconducting transition temperatures. We present density functional
calculations and a modiﬁed Schottky model incorporating the strong paraelectricity of SrTiO3 which
demonstrate that the doping may be due to charge transfer from SrTiO3 impurity bands driven by
work function mismatch. Physically relevant levels of Nb doping are shown to lead to doping of
the FeSe compatible with observation. The coupling of electrons in FeSe to polar phonons in the
depletion regime of the SrTiO3 is calculated. A λ ∼ 0.4 is found; the coupling to long-wavelength
phonons is found to be dominant.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictide and
calcogenide materials1 and the subsequent investigation
of the many remarkable properties of these materials2 has
added a new dimension to our understanding of supercon-
ductivity. The general consensus has been that the ma-
terials demonstrate the existence of a third route to high-
Tc superconductivity, based neither on very high phonon
frequencies3 nor on the physics of two dimensional spin
1/2 carriers near a Mott transition4. Orbital degener-
acy leading to a Fermi surface with multiple sheets and
to Hunds metal5, nematic and stripe6 behavior, as well
as pairing based on electron-electron interaction-induced
scattering of carriers between zone-edge electron pockets
and zone-center hole pockets have been regarded as key
to the physics2.

Recent studies of monolayer FeSe thin ﬁlms epitaxi-
ally grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates challenge this
understanding. The transition temperature of bulk FeSe
is lower than 10K and the record high transition tem-
perature for bulk members of the Fe-pnictide family is
56K7, but in the monolayer ﬁlms transition temperatures
as high as 100K has been reported8. Further, monolayer
FeSe on STO is heavily electron doped (about 0.12 e−
per Fe, as inferred from the photoemission-determined
Fermi surface9) so that the zone-center hole pocket found
in bulk pnictides is fully ﬁlled, leaving only the electron
pocket at the M point, indicating that the zone face to
zone center scattering processes are not crucial to the
high transition temperature superconductivity. These
ﬁnding suggest that our understanding of the Fe-Se ma-
terials is incomplete.

FeSe grown epitaxially on STO is not superconducting
if the thickness is larger than 2 unit cells. The thickness
dependence and the presence of sidebands in photoemis-
sion experiments10 has been considered as evidence that
proximity to the substrate is important and that ﬂuc-
tuations in the substrate help to enhance the transition
temperature. Gate-doped FeSe ﬂakes up to 10 nm thick
and potassium doped multi unit-cell FeSe ﬁlms also ex-
hibit transition temperatures between 45 and 50K11,12,
indicating it is possible that proximity to the substrate is

not essential for raising the transition temperature above
the bulk value, but is important for raising the transition
temperature above the highest value observed in bulk
materials. The longitudinal optic (LO) phonon modes of
STO are an attractive mechanism for a proximity eﬀect10
because these arise from dipolar ﬂuctuations which pro-
duce long ranged electric potentials. The proximity of
material to a ferroelectric transition (indeed a signal of
FE transition near 45K has been observed in some of the
13) may enhance the strength of
materials with high Tc
these ﬂuctuations.

In this paper we investigate monolayer FeSe on STO
theoretically. We perform density functional calculations
to obtain the structure and to determine band oﬀsets.
The band oﬀsets are found to be large, raising the pos-
sibility of charge transfer in the experimentally relevant
case where the STO is lightly electron-doped by Nb im-
purities or O vacancies. We treat charge transfer from the
impurity bands by adapting the usual Schottky model to
incorporate the physics of nearly ferroelectric STO. Ob-
served values of electron doping in the monolayer are con-
sistent with charge transfer from impurity bands charac-
teristic of the known doping levels of the STO substrates.
The oxygen vacancy eﬀect noted in Ref. 14 may also be
relevant.

A generic consequence of the Schottky model is that
the SrTiO3 impurity bands are fully depleted over a
many-unit cell wide region near the interface. Electric
ﬁelds in this depletion region are not screened, so that
polar phonons in this region may couple to the electrons
in the FeSe. We determine the electron-phonon coupling
Hamiltonian and compute the leading contribution to the
electron self energy, which corresponds to a coupling pa-
rameter λ ∼ 0.4 (the precise value depends on param-
eters whose values are not well established), with the
coupling dominated by long wavelength phonons. Our
work complements previous studies15–17 of the eﬀect of
SrTiO3 polar phonons on electrons in FeSe, in which a
phenomenological model was used.

II. FIRST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS

2

This section presents that results of ﬁrst principles
calculations that enable an estimation of the structure
and the basic energetics of monolayer FeSe on STO.
Our ﬁrst-principles calculations were performed using the
spin-dependent generalized gradient approximation with
the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization18 as
implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Pack-
age (VASP-5.319,20). Projector augmented wave (PAW)
potentials were used,21,22 with 6 valence electrons for Se
(4s24p4), 8 for Fe (3d74s1), 10 for Sr (4s24p65s2), 10
for Ti (3p63d24s2) and 6 for O (2s22p4). The energy
cutoﬀ was 500eV. A
2 in-plane cell was used to
investigate the consequences of octahedral rotations; as
these were found not to be important a 1× 1 in-plane cell
was used to generate the main band structure results. A
6×6×1 k-point mesh and 5×10−3 eV/˚A force threshold
were used for structural relaxations. A 14×14×1 k-point
mesh was used for density of states calculations. Phonons
of bulk STO are calculated by the frozen phonon method
in VASP, using a 3× 3× 3 supercell and 4× 4× 4 k-point
mesh, and post-processed via Phonopy23.

The monolayer of FeSe can be viewed as a layer of Fe
atoms sandwiched between two layers of Se atoms. We
assume epitaxial conditions, so the in-plane lattice con-
stant of the FeSe layer is set to be equal to that of STO
(a = 3.935˚A in our calculation). Note that there are
two Fe atoms per unit cell. We modeled the substrate
as a four unit cell-thick slab of SrTiO3 and included a
vacuum layer with thickness equal to three unit cells of
the SrTiO3 (see panel (a) of Fig. 1). The relative align-
ment of the FeSe layer with respect to the SrTiO3 is not
known. We considered two conﬁgurations: Structure I,
in which the bottom layer Se atoms align with the Ti
columns of the SrTiO3 and Structure II, in which the
bottom layer Se atoms align with the Sr columns of the
STO. Structure I is depicted in panel (a) of Fig. 1.

For both structures, we choose as an initial state the
striped antiferromagnetic (AFM) state that was consid-
ered to be the ground state for bulk FeSe24,25. Our spin
polarized GGA calculations for bulk FeSe (not shown)
also ﬁnd a striped antiferromagnet ground state. How-
ever, for the monolayer we ﬁnd that the calculation con-
verges to a nonmagnetic state.

After relaxation of atomic positions we ﬁnd that struc-
ture I is 27 meV/Fe lower in total energy than structure
II, and we thus take it to be the ground state structure
in this paper. However the essential features (including
for example band oﬀsets) are the same for both struc-
tures. We investigated the consequences of the a0a0c−
rotation that occurs in bulk SrTiO3 below 105K26 by
comparing calculations in which this rotation is allowed
and forbidden. We ﬁnd that the octahedral rotation is
suppressed in the TiO2 layer closest to the FeSe and that
(not shown) the atomic and electronic structure of the
FeSe is essentially the same whether or not SrTiO3 octa-
hedral rotations are considered. We therefore disregard

the rotations in what follows, and use a 1 × 1 unit cell
in the calculations subsequently reported. Panel (a) of
Fig. 1 shows the relaxed structure I obtained without in-
cluding SrTiO3 rotations. The proximal Se is found to be
separated from the surface Ti by 3.1˚A, and the distance
to the Fe plane is 4.3˚A, in agreement with previous DFT
calculations27. The Fe-Se-Fe bond angle is found to be
114.82◦, larger than the FeSe bulk value28. The diﬀerence
is due in part to the tensile epitaxial strain (∼ 4%) gener-
ated by the STO and in part may arise from the diﬀerence
in magnetic state: in bulk calculations the non-magnetic
state has a larger bond angle that the antiferromagnetic
state28,29

Panel (b) of Fig. 1 shows the important energy bands
computed for relaxed structure I. The FeSe layer is metal-
lic; its chemical potential sets the Fermi level which is
slightly above the top of the SrTiO3 valence band. The
FeSe fermi level (horizontal solid line at E = 1.34eV) lies
in the SrTiO3 energy gap so in this calculation there is no
charge transfer between the FeSe and the SrTiO3. As is
also the case for stoichiometric bulk pnictides, the mono-
layer is a compensated semimetal with two zone center
hole pockets and two zone-face electron pockets, centered
at the M (π/a, π/a) (using the notation appropriate to
the Brillouin zone corresponding to the two Fe unit cell).
Panel (c) of Fig. 1 presents the integrated density of
states of an isolated FeSe layer in the near fermi surface
region. The break in slope visible at E − EF ≈ 0.2eV is
due to the ﬁlling of the Γ point hole pocket. The slope
for energies greater than this value gives the density of
states of the electron pockets N (ε) ≈ 0.66 states/eV per

3
ence slightly less than the SrTiO3 band gap (∼ 2eV in
DFT band calculations and ∼ 3eV in experiment) which
may drive charge transfer. In this section we develop a
Schottky model modiﬁed to take into account the strong
ﬁeld dependence of the dielectric constant of SrTiO3, to
analyse this physics.

The basic situation is that charge doped into the FeSe
produces an electric ﬁeld, which bends the STO bands,
so that within a depletion regime extending a distance
d of the interface the electrochemical potential is below
the bottom of the STO impurity bands so there are no
carriers. The full depletion region is followed by a partial
depletion region over which the potential changes from
the bottom of the STO impurity band to the Fermi level
of the bulk STO impurity band. The width of the partial
depletion region is set by the Thomas-Fermi screening
length λTF but we shall see that the details of this region
are not important for the considerations presented here.
We model the carriers doped into the FeSe as a sheet of
areal charge density −eQ, set back a distance dFe ≈ 4.3˚A
from the interface. Following Stengel30 we model the
ﬁeld in the STO as a macroscopic displacement ﬁeld D
depending only on distance z from the interface, which
we take to be at z = 0. In the full depletion region D
obeys the equation

with Nd (typically ∼ 1020) the volume density of dopant
ions. Solving Eq. 1 we ﬁnd

and D(z > z0) = 0.

The value D0 of the displacement ﬁeld at z = 0 is set

by the charge in the FeSe as

D0 = −4πeQ

(3)

and the charge compensation length z0 is deﬁned as the
ratio of the FeSe charge to the volume density of dopant
ions Nd

z0 =

For typical values Q = 0.125e/Fe and Nd = 1020/cm3
z0 ≈ 15nm ∼ 40 unit cells. The size d of the full depletion
region is of course somewhat less than z0, and for z > d
the free charge of the SrTiO3 impurity bands must be
included in Eq. 1.

To compute the potential we determine the electric
ﬁeld E = D/ and integrate. Thus we need to know the
dielectric constant in the presence of displacement ﬁelds
of the order of the value D0 ∼ 3.× 108V /cm produced by
the charge density Q = 0.125/Fe. We may assume the di-
electric constant in the FeSe region takes a constant value
FeSe = 15 independent of D31, but the nearly ferroelec-
tric nature of SrTiO3 means that the dielectric constant

Angle-resolved photoemission experiments on mono-
layer FeSe ﬁnd that the hole pocket is fully ﬁlled but
also ﬁnd that the top of the hole pocket lies below the
bottom of the electron pocket9. However, experiment
and DFT calculations ﬁnd that bulk FeSe is a compen-
sated semimetal, in which necessarily the top of the hole
band lies above the bottom of the electron bands, with
the Fermi level in between. This suggests that a rigid
band approximation for the eﬀects of doping is inade-
quate, and that there is a density dependent change in
the band structure which as electrons are added acts to
lower the energy of the top of the hole bands relative
to the bottom of the electron band. Deviations from the
rigid band picture may explain why our DFT results indi-
cate that Q ≈ 0.17e/F e must be added to the monolayer
to ﬁll the hole band, while in experiment a Q ≈ 0.12 is
found.

III. CHARGE TRANSFER

The ﬁrst principles calculations reported in the previ-
ous section assume ideal SrTiO3, but the SrTiO3 sub-
strates used in experiments are lightly electron-doped.
The electrons reside in impurity bands which are typi-
cally close to the bottom of the SrTiO3 conduction band,
while the FeSe fermi level is close to the top of the
SrTiO3 valence band, suggesting a work function diﬀer-

placement ﬁelds (D0 ∼ 108V /cm) imply electric ﬁelds
very much larger than those for which STO has been
measured32, so theoretical input is required. We use the
calculations of Stengel30 which indicate that  depends
strongly on D but not strongly on its gradients and is
well described as a Lorentzian

We are interested in potential shifts of the order of
the SrTiO3 band gap ∼ 3eV . In principle, we must also
account for the shift in the FeSe Fermi level as carriers
are added. The monolayer FeSe integrated density of
states is shown in Fig. 1(c). We see that the change
in FeSe fermi level corresponding to a Q ∼ 0.2/F e is
small, of order a few tenths of an eV. Also, as shown in
the appendix, we may neglect the details of the behavior
in the Thomas-Fermi regime (over which the potential
changes by an amount of the order of the impurity band
width, also ∼ 0.1eV ), and simply compute the potential
proﬁle caused by a given level of charge in the FeSe.

Fig. 2 shows representative results. We see that the
potential rises rapidly and in a nearly linear manner for
the ﬁrst ∼ 10 unit cells. This pseudolinear behavior
comes from the increase in  as the charge is progres-
sively screened and D decreases. Following the pseudo-
linear regime, the potential then slowly approaches its
saturated value over the last several unit cells. The value
of linear response dielectric constant 0 aﬀects only the
ﬁnal asymptotic approach to the ﬁnal value, and for the
same reason the properties of the partly depleted region
do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the magnitude of the induced
charge. The sensitivity of the results to Q implies that
uncertainties in the values of ∞ and Nd do not have an
important eﬀect on the ﬁnal charge density. For exam-
ple, changing ∞ to 2 or 15 and Nd to 1.5 × 1020/cm3
produces essentially the same results. Thus our results
are sensitive to D(cid:63) and, to a less extent, the high-D limit
∞. The results are only weakly sensitive to the zero-ﬁeld
value 0, as long as it is large. Electron doping of the or-
der of the values seen in experiment may thus reasonably
be understood as coming from charge transfer from the
SrTiO3 impurity bands.

IV. COUPLING OF SRTIO3 DIPOLAR

PHONON MODES TO FESE ELECTRONS

Electric ﬁelds produced by polar phonons in the de-
pletion region are not screened, and so produce poten-
tial ﬂuctuations that can couple to electrons in the FeSe
layer. This type of electron-phonon coupling has been
10,
discussed in the context of monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3
but in that work the interaction was taken to be local,
arising from the dipoles nearest to the interface. Here we
present a general treatment.

We assume that in each unit cell of the depletion re-
gion there is a dipole, characterized by position R, dis-
placement u and eﬀective charge eZd. The potential at
position r in the FeSe layer due to the SrTiO3 dipoles is

V (r) =

where ∞ is the dielectric constant that SrTiO3 would
have in the absence of the dipoles. Here the sum over R
runs over the depletion and Thomas-Fermi regions; the
ﬁelds of dipoles farther inside the SrTiO3 are screened.
The corresponding electron-phonon term in the Hamil-

tonian is then

where ρq is the electron number density operator at mo-

tions are of order e−2πdF e/a ∼ 10−3 so can be neglected

where q = |q|, J = 1, 2, ... labels the Ti planes in the

Jth Ti plane from the interface and we have included the
eﬀects of screening of dipoles deep in the SrTiO3 by a
0 ≈ z0. Thus the electron-phonon
screening length q−1
coupling extends over a number of planes determined by
the smaller of the inverse of the in-plane momentum q
and the approximate thickness, z0, of the depletion layer.
We now quantize the dipole ﬂuctuations. For sim-
plicity we assume that the dipole ﬂuctuations in the
depletion region are those of undoped SrTiO3 and we
take in to account the interface by assuming that the z-
derivative of the phonon ﬁeld vanishes at the interface.
First-principles calculations31 indicate that SrTiO3 has
three important dipole-active (LO) phonon modes. We
calculated the frequencies, eﬀective charges, and masses
of these modes. Results (fully consistent with those of
Ref. 31) are given in Table I.

We then write the total dipole as a sum of ﬂuctuations

of these three modes,

mate considerations that provide a rough estimate of the
electron-phonon coupling strength and the physics of the

Fermi surface, the quasiparticle peaks get broadened due
to the nonzero imaginary part of self energy.

V. SUMMARY

8 raises many interesting questions.

The remarkable discovery of unusually high transition
temperature superconductivity in monolayers of FeSe on
SrTiO3
In this pa-
per, we have theoretically addressed two of these, show-
ing that work-function-mismatch-driven charge transfer
from the impurity bands of Nb (or O-vacancy) doped
STO can account for the doping of the FeSe, that a wide
depletion region exists in the STO, and that polar phonon
modes in the associated depletion regime of the STO can
couple to electrons in the FeSe layer via a coupling that
is not small and turns out to be divergent at long wave-
lengths. Determining the implications for the supercon-
ductivity is an interesting open question. The pnictides
are strongly correlated materials, and the interplay be-
tween electron-phonon coupling and strong correlations
is an unsolved problem. In particular, our estimates of
the eﬀect of the phonons on the electronic properties are
based on DFT values for the electronic dispersion and
compressibility. Both of these may be renormalized by
the strong correlations believed to be important in the
pnictides.
Investigation for example using the combi-
nation of density functional and dynamical mean ﬁeld
theory, would be fruitful. We observe that because the
phonons couple to the total charge density the methods
of Ref. 34 are applicable.

The phonons found to be important in this paper are
LO phonons with the relatively high frequency of 0.1 eV,
suggesting a large contribution to superconductivity. On
the other hand, they are long wavelength ﬂuctuations,
and forward scattering typically does not make the domi-
nant contribution to the pairing interaction. This issue as
well as the interplay with nematic ﬂuctuations need fur-
ther investigations. Connections to related experimental
systems also require investigations. Superconductivity
with critical temperatures of the order of 50-60K has been
observed in FeSe ﬂakes on SiO2/Si surface doped via a
liquid electrolyte11 and for monolayers of FeSe grown on
35. The 50-60K transition temperature is
anatase TiO2
much higher than the ∼ 8K Tc of bulk FeSe but is lower
than the 100K reported for monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3.
Whether the SiO2 and TiO2 sustain polar phonon ﬂuc-
tuations that have a similar eﬀect to those of SrTiO3 are
open questions that require further investigation. Also
there are indications in the liquid electrolyte doped sys-
tem that the doping extends more than one or two lay-
ers. Any polar ﬂuctuations from the substrate would be
screened within one or two unit cells, suggesting that it

There are uncertainties in the size of the electron-
phonon coupling. The basic coupling scales are quadrat-
ically sensitive to the background dielectric constant and
the phonon frequency (which may be aﬀected by the
boundary), and the electronic dispersion is somewhat un-
certain.

Fig. 3 shows the lowest order self energy near the
Fermi surface, and the spectral functions due to the
electron-phonon coupling based on above assumptions
corresponding to the points at and below the Fermi sur-
face. The self energy weakly depends on k, the dominant
contribution comes from the LO mode with frequency
97.1 meV, and so the imaginary part of the self energy
shows a 2∆ ≈ 200meV gap near the Fermi level. The
other two LO modes generate moderate corrections that
are revealed by the small plateaus in the 2∆ gap. Ac-

may be possible to distinguish the eﬀects of the phonons
we have calculated here from other physics operating in
the system. In the end, we ﬁnd that the charge transfer
and the associated electron-phonon coupling are general
for the heterostructure of superconductor thin ﬁlms on
top of dielectrics when the work function mismatch is
large enough, and it would be interesting to investigate
these eﬀects in other systems such as other iron pnictides,
chalcoginides and cuprates for which layered structures
are available.

Appendix A: The partial depleted region

Instead of assuming an abrupt boundary of depletion
region in the Schottky model, we consider a smooth tran-
sition. Let us consider a ﬂat impurity band with the band
width W . We set up the coordinates as following, z is
normal to the interface with the positive direction points
in FeSe, and the surface of STO has z = 0, so that for
z = −∞ the Fermi level sits at the center of the impurity
band, corresponding to the doping level DW/2 = Nd,
where D is the constant density of states of the impurity
band and Nd is the electron density in bulk Nb-doped
STO.

As in the Schottky model, the impurity band bends
along the bottom of the conduction band at the interface.
We set a critical distance z0 (z0 < 0) such that when
z < z0, there are excessed electrons in STO, but when
z > z0 all the excessed electrons are depleted into FeSe.

The impurity band has a small band width which we

depletion region.

Color lines denote diﬀerent transferred charge density: 0.13
(upper curve), 0.12 (middle) and 0.11 (lowest) e/Fe.

Let us assume that for the partial depletion region the
dielectric constant is a large constant  ≈ 0 = 500. This
gives us a upper limits of the screening length and the
charge that are transferred out.

λTF = 35.5˚A and Nq = 0.03/Fe are also both constants.
This means that the depletion region is reduced by, to
the upper limit, 35.5˚A. The potential proﬁle with depth
is shown in Fig. A1. For 0.12 e/Fe surface charge density,
the depletion region is now about 27 unit cells. Most
of the work function diﬀerence should be compensated
within this region, leaving 0.05 eV compensated by the
partial depleted region where the potential energy decays
exponentially.

33 We evaluate the two dimensional integral of λ that is di-
rectly from the expression of the self energy in Eq. 15. A
converged value λ ≈ 0.5, is obtained. The slightly larger
value than our value in the main text comes from the con-
tribution where k(cid:48) (cid:54)≈ kF .
