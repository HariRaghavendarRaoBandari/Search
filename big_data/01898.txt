A new insight into neutrino energy loss by electron capture of

iron group nuclei in magnetars surface

Jing-Jing Liu 1,2 and Wei-Min Gu1

ABSTRACT

Based on the relativistic mean-ﬁeld eﬀective interactions theory, and Lai dong model
(Lai & Shapiro 1991; Lai. 2001, 2015), we discuss the inﬂuences of superstrong magnetic ﬁelds
(SMFs) on electron Fermi energy, nuclear blinding energy, and single-particle level structure in
magnetars surface. By using the method of Shell-Model Monte Carlo (SMMC), and the Random
Phase Approximation (RPA) theory, we detailed analyze the neutrino energy loss rates(NELRs)
by electron capture (EC) for iron group nuclei in SMFs. Firstly, when B12 < 100, we ﬁnd that the
SMFs has a slight inﬂuence on the NELR for most nuclides at relativistic low temperature(e.g.,
T9 = 0.233), nevertheless, the NELRs increases by more than four orders of magnitude at rela-
tivistic high temperature(e.g., T9 = 15.53). When B12 > 100, the NELRs decreases by more than
three orders of magnitude (e.g., at T9 = 15.53 for 52−61Fe, 55−60Co and 56−63Ni). Secondly, for a
certain value of magnetic ﬁeld and temperature, the NELRs increases by more than four orders
of magnitude when ρ7 ≤ 103, but as the density increases(i.e. when ρ7 > 103), there are almost
not inﬂuence of density on NELRs. For the density around ρ7 = 102, there is an abrupt increase
in NELRs when B12 ≥ 103.5. Such jumps are an indication that the underlying shell structure
has changed due to single-particle behavior by SMFs. Finally, we compare our NELRs with
those of Fuller et al. (1982, 1985) (FFN), and Nabi & Klapdor-Kleingrothaus (1999) (NKK). For
the case without SMFs, one ﬁnds that our rates for certain nuclei are about close to ﬁve orders
magnitude lower than FFN, and NKK at relativistic low temperature (e.g., T9 = 1). However,
at the relativistic high temperature (e.g., T9 = 3), our results are in good agreement with NKK,
but about one order magnitude lower than FFN. For the case with SMFs, our NELRs for some
iron group nuclei can be about ﬁve orders of magnitude higher than those of FFN, and NKK.
(note B12, T9, and ρ7 are in unit of 1012G, 109K, and 107g/cm3, respectively)

Introduction

In the process of core-collapse supernova ex-
plosions, neutrino processes and weak interaction
(e.g. electron capture(hereafter EC) and beta de-
cay) play pivotal roles. At the late stages of evo-
lution, a large amount of energy from a stellar is

lost mainly through neutrinos and this process is
fairly independent of the mass of star. For in-
stance, White dwarfs and supernovae, both have
cooling rates largely dominated by neutrino pro-
duction. At high temperatures and densities, the
EC and the accompanying neutrino energy loss
rates (hereafter NELRs) are of prime importance
in determining the equation of state of supernova.
An accurate determination of neutrino emission
rates is very necessary in order to perform a care-
ful analysis of the ﬁnal branches of stellar evo-
lutionary tracks. The neutrino cooling rates can

strongly inﬂuence on the evolutionary time scale
and the conﬁguration of iron core at the onset of
the supernova explosion.

Some researches for cooling of white dwarfs,
neutron stars, and magnetars need us giving
a accurate estimation of some weak interac-
tion rates and NELRs. Due to the importance
of the EC and NELRs in astrophysical envi-
ronments, Beaudet et al. (1967); Braaten et al.
(1993); Ahmad et al. (2010); Esposito et al. (2003);
Fuller et al. (1980, 1982, 1985); Itoh et al. (1996);
Juodagalvis et al. (2010); Langanke et al. (2001);
Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo. (1998); Liu. (2013c,d,e,
2015, 2016) have done some pioneering works on
the weak interaction reactions and NELRs for
some iron group nuclei. Recently, by using the
proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase ap-
proximation (pn-QRPA) theory, Nabi & Sajjad
(2014); Nabi & Klapdor-Kleingrothaus (1999, 2004)
have detailed investigated the neutrino and anti-
neutrino energy loss rates. However, their works
seemed to pay no attention to the inﬂuence of
superstrong magnetic ﬁelds (hereafter SMFs)on
NELRs.

The neutrino processes will play a crucial role
in magnetars and some neutron stars due to elec-
tron capture (EC) and beta decay. A great deal of
energies and messages set free with the escape of
the neutrino. Thus, the works on neutrino and the
NELRs have been the hotspot and former-border
issue in magnetars and some neutron stars.
In
order to understand the nature of the weak in-
teraction process and NELRs in magnetars, the
study of matter in SMFs is obviously an impor-
tant component of magnetars in astrophysics re-
search. Some works show that the strengths of
magnetic ﬁelds at the crust of neutron stars are
in the range of 108 − 1013G (Baym et al. 1998;
Dai et al. 1993). There has recently been growing
evidence for the existence of neutron stars pos-
sessing magnetic ﬁelds with strengths that exceed
the quantum critical ﬁeld strength of 4.4× 1013 G.
Such evidence has been provided by new discov-
eries of radio pulsars having very high spin-down
rates and by observations of bursting gamma-ray
sources termed magnetars. In addition, some re-
searches show that magnetars possess magnetic
ﬁelds as strong as from 1013G to 1015G (Gao et al.
2011,?; Harding et al. 2006; Lai & Shapiro 1991;
Lai. 2001, 2015; Peng et al. 2012). Although it is

2

not clear how strong magnetic ﬁelds in magnetars
could be, some calculations indicate that ﬁelds of
1015−1016 G are not impossible. Theoretical mod-
els display that these magnetic ﬁelds might reach
up to 1018 G, and even larger values when one
considers the limit imposed by the virial theorem
(Ormand et al. 1994). For such SMFs, the classi-
cal description of the trajectories of a free electron
is no longer valid and quantum eﬀect must be con-
sidered.

Previous works (Liu. 2013a,b) show that SMFs
inﬂuences on electron capture rate and NELRs
greatly and decreases with the increasing of
the strength of magnetic ﬁeld. Recent studies
(Lai & Shapiro 1991; Lai. 2001, 2015) have found
the magnetic ﬁeld will make the Fermi surface
would elongate from a spherical surface to a Lan-
dau surface along the magnetic ﬁeld direction and
its level is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld di-
rection and strongly quantized. The properties
of matter (such as atoms, molecules, and con-
densed matter/plasma) are dramatically changed
by the superstrong magnetic ﬁelds in magnetars.
Recently, due to the inﬂuence of SMFs, the elec-
tron cyclotron kinetic energy will be greater than
electron-static energy in magnetars. The micro-
scopic state number of electron momentum along
the ﬁeld in the interval of Pz ∼ Pz + dPz, is ob-
tained via using the non-relativistic motion equa-
tion. Based on the above mentioned conditions,
we detailed discuss some properties of matter of
magnetar surface due to these are signiﬁcantly
modiﬁed by strong magnetic ﬁelds. We also ana-
lyze the inﬂuences of SMFs on NELRs from the
EC reaction for some iron group nuclei.

Our work diﬀers from previous works (Fuller et al.

1980, 1982, 1985) about the discussion of electron
capture process and NELRs. Firstly, their works
are based on the theory of Brink Hypothesis by
FFN and overlooked the inﬂuence of SMFs on
EC and NELRs. Secondly, our work also diﬀers
from the works of Nabi & Klapdor-Kleingrothaus
(1999, 2004). they detailed discussed the NELRs
by using the quasi-particle random phase approxi-
mation theory only in the case without SMFs. We
analyze the EC process and NELRs for iron group
nuclei and derive new results in SMFs according
to the Shell-Model Monte Carlo (SMMC) method
(Juodagalvis et al. 2010; Langanke et al. 2001).
Although Juodagalvis et al. (2010); Langanke et al.

(2001) detailed discussed the EC in presupernova
surrounding, but they have lost sight of the inﬂu-
ence of SMFs on the EC process and NELR. We
make detailed comparison of our results in SMFs
with those of FFN, and (Nabi & Klapdor-Kleingrothaus
1999) (hereafter NKK), which are in the case with-
out SMFs. Finally, our discussions also diﬀers
from recent works of Liu. (2013a,b), which ana-
lyzed the EC and NELRs by using the method
of Brink Hypothesis. The Brink Hypothesis is
a very crude approximation, which assumes that
the Gamow-Teller strength distribution on ex-
cited states is the same as for the ground state,
only shifted by the excitation energy of the state.
By using the method of SMMC, and the RPA
theory, we discuss NELRs by EC of some typi-
cal iron group nuclei basing on Lai dong model
(Lai & Shapiro 1991; Lai. 2001, 2015)in SMF.
Based on the relativistic mean-ﬁeld eﬀective in-
teractions theory, we discuss the inﬂuences of
SMFs on electron Fermi energy, blinding energy
per nuclei, and single-particle level structure in
magnetars surface. We also detailed compare our
results in SMFs with those of FFN, and NKK.
These NELRs of iron group nuclei may be univer-
sal, very important and helpful for the researches
of thermal and magnetic evolution, particularly
for study of cooling mechanisms, and numerical
simulation of the neutron stars and magnetars.

The present paper is organized as follows. In
the next Section, we analyze the inﬂuence of SMFs
on the electron property and nuclear energy in
magnetars. The studies about the EC process and
NELRs in SMFs will be given in Section 3. Some
numerical results and discussion are given in Sec-
tion 4. And some conclusions are summarized in
the last section.

2. The inﬂuence of SMFs in magnetars

2.1. How will the SMFs inﬂuence on the
electron properties in magnetar sur-
face

The properties of matter are signiﬁcantly mod-
iﬁed by strong magnetic ﬁelds, such as the states
equation, electron energy, the outer crust struc-
ture and composition in neutron stars. Many
works
(Landau & Lifshitz. 1977; Canuto et al.
1977) detailed presented the quantum mechanics
of a charged particle in SMFs. When we consider

3

the nonrelativistic motion of a particle (charge ei
and mass mi) in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, which
is assumed to be along the z-axis, the circular or-
bit radius and (angular) frequency in the process
of particle gyrates are given by r = micv⊥/|ei|B,
ωc = |ei|B/mic, respectively, here v⊥ is the ve-
locity perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The
kinetic energy for electron (mi → me, ei → −e)of
the transverse motion is quantized in Landau lev-
els in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, and is
written by

Ekin =

where nl = 0, 1, 2... is Landau levels number. The
cyclotron energy for a electron, which is the basic
energy quantum is given by

Ecyc = ωc = 

eB
ec

= 11.577B12keV,

(2)

where B12 = B/1012G is the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in units of 1012 Gauss, The total elec-
tron energy, which is included the kinetic energy
associated with the z-momentum (pz) and the
spin energy in non-relativistic quantum surround-
ing can be written as (Landau & Lifshitz. 1977;
Canuto et al. 1977)

En = νωc +

2me

,

(3)

where ν = nl + (1 + σz)/2. σz = −1, σz = ±1
are the spin degeneracy for the ground Landau
level(nl = 0), and excited levels, respectively.

We deﬁne a critical magnetic ﬁeld strength Bcr
from the relation of ωc = mec2 (i.e. Bcr =
m2
ec3/e = 4.414 × 103G). The transverse motion
of the electron becomes relativistic when ωc ≥
mec2 (i.e. B ≥ Bcr) for extremely strong mag-
netic ﬁelds. The energy eigenstates of electron
must obey the relativistic Dirac equation and is
given by (Canuto et al. 1977; Johnson et al. 1949)

En = [c2p2

(4)

where the shape of the Landau wavefunction in the
relativistic theory is the same as in the nonrela-
tivistic theory due to the fact the cyclotron radius
is independent of the particle mass. (Peng et al.
2012)

In SMFs the number density ne of elec-
trons is related to the chemical potential UF by

wave packet), and gn0 is the spin degeneracy of the
Landau level, g00 = 1 and gn0 = 2 for n > 1, and
f = [1 + exp((En− UF )/kT )]−1 is the Fermi-Dirac
distribution.
According to the relation of the usual relativis-
tic energy and momentum from Eq.(4), the inter-
action energy term, which is proportional to the
quantum number ν, and cannot exceed the elec-
tron chemical potential, will appears due to the
electron interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld. Thus
the maximum number of Landau levels νmax, re-
lated to the highest value of the allowed interac-
tion energy should be satisﬁed with En(νmax, pz =
0) = UF . So we have

νmax =

However, in the general case (i.e. 0 ≤ ν ≤

equaled to the Fermi momentum PF for diﬀerent
Landau level value ν, the electron chemical poten-
tial from Eq.(4) can be computed as follows

2.2. How will the SMFs inﬂuence on the
energy of nucleus in magnetar surface

The matter in the outer crust of a cold (T =
0K) magnetar consists of a Coulomb lattice of
completely ionized atoms and a uniform Fermi gas
of relativistic electrons. The Gibbs free energy per
baryon g(A, Z, P ) at a constant pressure and zero
temperature can be given by

g(A, Z, P ) =

E(A, Z, P ) + P V

A

= ε +

P
n

,

(11)

where ε is the corresponding energy per nucleon,
n = A/V is the baryon density in a cell, and V is
the volume occupied by a unit cell of the Coulomb
lattice. The energy per nucleon ε, which consists
of three diﬀerent contributions from nuclear, elec-
tronic, and lattice is given by

ε = εn(A, Z) + εe(A, Z, P ) + εl(A, Z, n),

(12)

where the nuclear contribution to the total energy
per nucleon is simple and independent of the den-
sity and is written by

εn(A, Z) =

M (A, Z)

A

=

A

[zmp+(A−Z)mn−εbind(A, Z)],

(13)
where M (A, z) is the nuclear mass, εbind(A, Z) is
the corresponding binding energy, and mn and mp
are neutron and proton masses, respectively.

When we deﬁne a nondimensional Fermi mo-
mentum xe(ν) = pF /mec, and Fermi energy γe =
UF /mec2, the electronic density, electron energy,
and pressure can be written as (Lai & Shapiro
1991)

Based on the relativistic mean-ﬁeld eﬀective
interactions theory of NL3 (Lalazissis et al. 1997)
and DD-ME2 (Lalazissis et al. 2005), Pe˜na Arteaga et al.
(2011) detailed discussed the inﬂuence of SMFs on
the nuclear binding energies. Based on a covari-
ant density functional, an eﬀective Lagrangian
with nucleons and mesons is given by simple
and independent of the density and is written
by (Gambhir et al. 1990; Vretenar et al. 2005)

L = LN + Lm + Lint + LBO + LBM ,

(14)

where LN , Lm, and Lint are the Lagrangian of
the free nucleon, the free meson ﬁelds and the
electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by the proton, and

the Lagrangian describing the interactions, respec-
tively. These Lagrangian are represented by

centered cubic or simple cubic ones can be carried
out evaluating diﬀerent lattice conﬁgurations.

The Gamow-Teller (GT) properties of nuclei
in the medium mass region of the periodic ta-
ble are crucial determinants in the process of
electron capture. Some works (Fassio-Canuto, L.
1969; Canuto et al. 1977) demonstrated that the
GT transition matrix elements for electron cap-
ture and beta decay don’t depend on the magnetic
ﬁelds. Thus we will neglect the eﬀect of SMFs on
the GT properties of nuclei in this paper. The
SMMC method is based on a statistical formula-
tion of the nuclear many-body problem. We use
the shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC) approach
to ﬁnd the GT strength distributions. SMMC has
the added advantage that it treats nuclear tem-
perature exactly. Based on a statistical formu-
lation of the nuclear many-body problem, in the
ﬁnite-temperature version of this approach, an ob-
servable is calculated as the canonical expectation
value of a corresponding operator ˆA by the SMMC
method at a given temperature T , and is writ-
ten by (Koonin et al. 1992; Ormand et al. 1994;
Alhassid et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1993)

ˆA =

TrA[ ˆAe−β

,

(22)

The problem of shell model Hamiltonian ˆH
have been detailed investigated by Alhassid et al.
(1994). When some many-body Hamiltonian ˆH
is given, a tractable expression for the imaginary
time evolution operator is written by

ˆU = exp−β

ˆH

,

(23)

where β = 1/TN, TN is the nuclear temperature
in units of Mev. TrA ˆU is the canonical partition
function for A nucleons.
In terms of a spectral
expansion, the total strength of a transition oper-
ator ˆA is then given by the following expectation
value:

B(A) ≡ h ˆA† ˆAi = Pi,f e−βEi|hf| ˆA|ii|2

,

(24)

here |ii, |fi are the many-body states of the initial
(ﬁnal) nucleus with energy Ei, Ef , respectively.

Pi e−βEi

The SMMC method is used to calculate the
response function RA(τ ) of an operator ˆA at an
imaginary-time τ . By using a spectral distribution
of initial and ﬁnal states |ii and |fi with energies
Ei and Ef . RA(τ ) is given by (Dean et al. 1998;
Langanke et al. 2001; Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo.
1998)

RA(τ ) ≡ h ˆA†(τ ) ˆA(0)i = TrA[e−(β−τ )

Note that the total strength for the operator is
given by R(τ = 0). SGT+ is the total amount
of GT strength available for an initial state is
given by summing over a complete set o ﬁnal
states in GT transition matrix elements |MGT|2
if .
The strength distribution is given by (Dean et al.
1998)

SGT+ (E) =

Pif δ(E − Ef + Ei)(2Ji + 1)e−βEi |hf | ˆA|ii|2

Pi(2Ji + 1)e−βEi

= SA(E),

(26)

RA(τ ) =R ∞

which is related to RA(τ ) by a Laplace Transform,
−∞ SA(E)e−τ EdE. Note that here E is
the energy transfer within the parent nucleus, and
that the strength distribution SGT+ (E) has units
of Mev−1.

3.2. The NELRs and EC process in the

case without SMFs

Based on the RPA theory with a global param-
eterization of the single particle numbers, the stel-
lar electron capture rates which is related to the
electron capture cross-section for the k th nucleus
(Z, A) in thermal equilibrium at temperature T
is given by a sum over the initial parent states i
and the ﬁnal daughter states f in the case with-
out SMFs (Dean et al. 1998; Langanke et al. 2001;
Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo. 1998)

only under the condition that the electron wave-
functions are locally approximated by the plane-
wave functions.
(Dai et al. 1993) The condition
requires that the Fermi wavelength λF ∼ /PF (PF
is the Fermi momentum without a magnetic ﬁeld)
be smaller than the radius √2ζ (where ζ = λe/b
) of the cylinder which corresponds to the lowest
Landau level(Baym et al. 1998).

4. Some numerical results and discussion

An SMFs can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the cooling
properties and thermal structure of a neutron star
crust. In general, the thermal insulation can be de-
creased by the magnetic ﬁeld due to Landau quan-
tization of electron motion. However, the ther-
mal insulation of the envelope may be increased
by the tangential magnetic ﬁeld, which parallel to
the stellar surface due to the fact that the Larmor
rotation of the electron signiﬁcantly reduces the
transverse thermal conductivity. An SMFs also
strongly aﬀects the cooling curve of a neutron star
and magnetar. This is because for a given core
temperature, the time evolution largely depends
on neutrino emission from the surface and core of
a neutron star and magnetar.

Figures 1-4 display the NELRs of some iron
group nuclei as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
B12 at relatively low, and medium density (i.e.
ρ7 = 5.86, 14.5) and some typical temperature sur-
rounding (i.e. T9 = 0.233, 15.53). One ﬁnds that
when B12 < 100 and at relatively low tempera-
ture (e.g. T9 = 0.233) the magnetic ﬁeld has a
slight eﬀect on the NELRs for most nuclides from
Figure 1 and 3. But the NELR of most nuclides
are inﬂuenced greatly at relatively high tempera-
ture (e.g. T9 = 15.53). For example, for most iron
group nuclei (e.g.52−61Fe, 55−60Co and 56−63Ni),
the NELRs increases by by more than four or-
ders of magnitude at T9 = 15.53 when B12 < 100.
However, the NEL rates decrease by more than
three orders of magnitude when B12 > 100 in Fig-
ure 1, but B12 > 200 in Figure 2.

From Figure 1 to 4, we detailed discuss the
NELRs due to EC process according to SMMC
method, especially for the contribution for EC due
to the GT transition base on RPA theory. One
ﬁnds that the inﬂuences of SMFs on NELR are
signiﬁcant. It is due to the fact that we have more
available phase space for electron in the higher the
magnetic ﬁeld at a given density. On the other
hand, the electron is very relativistic in the crust
of magnetar, where the matter density is higher
and magnetic ﬁeld strength may greatly exceed
the surface value. The mean Fermi energy of an
electron will exceed its rest-mass energy at suf-
ﬁciently high density. The electron also is very
relativistic when the cyclotron energy of an elec-
tron also higher than its rest-mass energy at suf-
ﬁciently high magnetic ﬁeld. The electron cap-
ture will rapid occur when the electron energy be-
comes larger than the diﬀerence between the neu-
tron and proton rest-mass energy(about 1.3MeV).
This EC process will destroy electrons and emit
massive neutrino, thereby changing the composi-
tion of matter and softening the state equation of
magnetar surface.

The cross sections(hereafter ECCS) are very
important parameter in electron capture process.
We ﬁnd the inﬂuence of SMFs on ECCS at dif-
ferent temperature is very signiﬁcant for some nu-
clides due to the diﬀerence of Q-value. Given the
signiﬁcant energy dependence of cross sections for
a process like electron capture on nuclei, it is clear
that in some cases the rates will be increased at
the same temperature and density as the mag-
netic ﬁeld increases. With increasing of electron
energy, the ECCS increases according to our inves-
tigations. The higher the temperature, the faster
the changes of ECCS becomes. It is because that
the higher the temperature, the larger the elec-
tron energy becomes. Thus even more electrons
will join in the EC process due to their energy
is greater than the Q-values. Furthermore, the
GT transition may be dominated at high tem-
perature surroundings. On the other hand, the
trigger mechanism of electron capture process re-
quires a minimum electron energy given by the
mass splitting between parent and daughter (i.e.
Qif ). The EC threshold energy is lowered by the
internal excitation energy at ﬁnite temperature.
The GT strength for even-even parent nuclei cen-
tered at daughter excitation energies of order of

8

2Mev at low temperatures. Therefore, the ECCS
for these parent nuclei increase drastically within
the ﬁrst couple of MeV of electron energies above
threshold, which will reﬂecting the GT distribu-
tion. But the GT distribution for odd-A nuclei
will peak at noticeably higher daughter excitation
energies at low temperatures. So the ECCS are
shifted to higher electron energies for odd-A nu-
clei in comparison to even-even parent nuclei by
about 3 MeV.

However, form ﬁgures 1-4, one ﬁnds that a sys-
tematic decrease in neutrino energy loss rate when
B12 > 100. We know that the Landau energy
level spacing will become a very small fraction
for the Fermi energy when νmax ≫ 1. The con-
tinuous integral may take in lieu of the discrete
sum over all Landau level. The thermodynamic
relation will reduce to the case of non-magnetic
ﬁelds. We have νmax → Ue/ωc when the electron
gas is of mildly relativistic state. For relativis-
tic electron gas, the νmax ≥ 100/B12 when the
Ue ≥ 1MeV. Therefore, as magnetic ﬁeld strength
increases(i.e. when B12 ≥ 10 ∼ 100), the νmax
will tend to the order of unity(or zero), and the
ﬁeld will be termed strongly quantizing. On the
other hand, The structure at the outer crust of
magnetars is fundamentally determined by the en-
ergies of isolated nuclei, the kinetic energy of elec-
trons and the lattice energy. Thus its composi-
tion is strongly depends on the binding energy per
particle of stable and unstable nuclei in the outer
crust of magnetar below the neutron drip density.
Based on the relativistic mean-ﬁeld eﬀective inter-
actions NL3 (Lalazissis et al. 1997) and DD-ME2
(Lalazissis et al. 2005), the inﬂuences of SMFs on
the binding energy of nuclei have been investi-
gated following the works of Pe˜na Arteaga et al.
(2011) and Basilico et al. (2015). We ﬁnd that
the binding energy per particle will have a mean
parabolic increasing trend with increasing of the
magnetic ﬁeld. For example, the binding energy
increase by 0.311MeV, 0.632MeV, 0.445MeV for
56Fe, 78Ni, 56Co, respectively when the magnetic
ﬁeld strength from 1017G to 1018G. Due to in-
crease of nuclear binding energy, the nuclear will
be more stable. This is equivalent to signiﬁ-
cantly raise the threshold energy of EC reaction.
Thus, the NELRs and EC rates will decreased in
SMFs. Meanwhile, as the magnetic ﬁeld strength
increases, the electron Fermi energy will decrease

greatly due to interaction between the electrons
and SMFs. This actually discourages the EC re-
action. So the the NELRs and EC rates decrease.
The magnetic ﬁeld strongly eﬀects on the elec-
tron phase space, Only axial symmetry is pre-
served, and breaks spherical symmetry for the
Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations (Pe˜na Arteaga et al.
2011). For a certain value of magnetic ﬁeld, Fig-
ures 5-6 present the NELRs of some typical iron
group nuclei versus the density ρ7 at tempera-
ture of T9 = 0.133, 11.33. One ﬁnds that the
NELRs increase greatly and even exceed by four
orders of magnitude for a certain value of mag-
netic ﬁeld and temperature. With increasing of
the density, there are almost not inﬂuence of den-
sity on NELRs. On the other hand, for the density
around ρ7 = 102, there is an abrupt increase in
NELRs when 103.5 ≤ B12 ≤ 105. Such jumps
are an indication that the underlying shell struc-
ture has changed in a fundamental way. These
jumps in nuclear properties can be traced to the
single-particle behavior due to SMFs. As the mag-
netic ﬁeld increases, a particle will remove from
a level going upwards and bring to a level going
downward with increasing spin. Furthermore, the
nucleus becomes spin-polarized due to these two
levels have opposite angular momentum along the
symmetry axis.

The SMFs inﬂuences on the single-particle
structure of nuclei
for protons and neutrons.
Firstly, the interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld
and the neutron (proton) magnetic dipole mo-
ment will cause nucleon paramagnetism.
Sec-
ondly, the coupling of the orbital motion of pro-
tons with the magnetic ﬁeld will also cause pro-
ton orbital magnetism. Due to the interaction
between the nucleus and SMFs, all degeneracies
in the single-particle spectrum may be removed,
and the formerly degenerate levels with oppos-
ing signs of angular momentum projection will
also tends to break (as a example, for 56Fe, the
detailed discussions can be seen from Figs.
3
and 5 of Ref.(Pe˜na Arteaga et al. 2011)). Such
single-particle energy splitting will produce a re-
duction of the neutron and proton pairing gaps
with increasing magnetic ﬁelds and, eventually,
their disappearance

According to the discussion of the inﬂuences
from the single-particle level by SMFs, one ﬁnds
that the Kramer’s degeneracy in angular momen-

13

tum projection of proton levels is removed by the
orbital magnetism associated with proton ballistic
dynamics, which can bring those aligned with the
magnetic ﬁeld down in energy. On the other hand,
the paramagnetic response (Pauli magnetism) also
removes the angular momentum projection degen-
eracy for both protons and neutrons.

Synthesizes the above analysis, one can con-
cludes that the last occupied single-particle lev-
els(e.g., for 56Fe)for neutron, including the inﬂu-
ence of the proton orbital coupling and the anoma-
lous magnetic moments coupling, decreases as the
magnetic ﬁeld strength increases. However, the
last occupied single-particle levels for proton will
increase. As is known to all, the EC is actually
the process that protons will turn into neutrons
and discharge a neutrino when a nuclei capture an
electron. Thereby, to a certain extent, these inﬂu-
ences of SMFs on single-particle level for proton
and neutron states, ultimately make the EC reac-
tion become more active and increase the NELRs.
The SMFs may not directly inﬂuence on the
lattice energy. Nevertheless, some indirect inﬂu-
ence on the lattice conﬁguration will be caused by
Coulomb screening. We ﬁnd energetically favor-
able to arrange the ionized nuclei in a Coulomb
lattice in the typical density range of the mag-
netar surface(i.e. 104g/cm3 ∼ 4 × 1011g/cm3).
In relativistic lower range of density, the electron
energy and the Coulomb crystal does not play a
relevant role in magnetar crust. As the density in-
creases, the electron energy raises greatly as com-
pared to the total energy, which is very advanta-
geous for electronic capture processes. however,
the lattice energy inﬂuence remain negligible. So,
we ignore the inﬂuence of SMFs on the lattice en-
ergy, the EC and NELRs. On the other hand,
the cyclotron energy ωce is much larger than the
typical Coulomb energy, Therefore, the proper-
ties of atoms, molecules and condensed matter are
qualitatively changed by the magnetic ﬁeld when
B ≫ 2.3505× 109G. The usual perturbative treat-
ment from the magnetic inﬂuence on Zeeman split-
ting of atomic energy levels does not apply in such
regime of SMFs due to the Coulomb forces act as
a perturbation to the magnetic forces(Garstang.
1977). The Coulomb force becomes much more
eﬀective in binding the electrons along the mag-
netic ﬁeld direction due to the extreme conﬁne-
ment of the electrons in the transverse direction

(i.e. perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld). The
atom attains a cylindrical structure. Moreover,
it is possible for these elongated atoms to form
molecular chains by covalent bonding along the
ﬁeld direction.

e B3/2

One can also see that as SMFs increases, the
change of NELRs will reﬂect some diﬀerence due
to strong quantum eﬀects in SMFs from Figures 5-
6. As the density increases, when ρ ≥ ρB and T ≤
TB, where ρB = 7.04 × 103Y −1
12 g/cm3, TB =
e(ν))−1/2K, the electrons will
1.34 × 108B12(1 + x2
be strongly degenerate, and populate many Lan-
dau levels (Lai. 2001, 2015). The magnetic ﬁeld
is termed weakly quantizing. Thus the chemical
potential, EC rates, and NELRs are only slightly
aﬀected by SMFs. With increasing T , the os-
cillations become weaker because of the thermal
broadening of the Landau levels. When T ≥ TB or
ρ ≫ ρB, more electrons will populate many Lan-
dau levels and the thermal widths of the Landau
levels (∼ kT ) are higher than the level spacing.
The magnetic ﬁelds have almost no inﬂuence on
the EC and NELRs.

GT strength distributions play an important
role in EC process in the astrophysical con-
text. Fassio-Canuto, L. (1969), and Canuto et al.
(1977) demonstrated that the GT transition ma-
trix elements for EC don’t depend on the mag-
netic ﬁelds. Thus we will neglect the eﬀect of
SMFs on the GT properties of nuclei in this paper.
A strong phase space dependence makes the EC
rates more sensitive to GT distributions than to
total strengths. We present GT strength distribu-
tions from shell model Monte Carlo studies of some
typical fp-shell iron group nuclei in Figures 7-8.
We also display the experimental data about GT
distributions (Alford et al. 1993; Williams et al.
1995; El-Kateb et al. 1994; Rapaport et al. 1984),
which are obtained from intermediate-energy
charge exchange (n, p) or (p, n) cross sections at
forward angles, which are proportional to the GT
strength. We exclude contributions from other
multipolarities for these experimental distribu-
tions, which extend only to 8 MeV in the daugh-
ter nucleus. We compare our SMMC results for
the GT+ distribution against experiment in Fig-
ures 7-8. One ﬁnds that the SMMC results for
all even-even nuclei (e.g., 54,56Fe; 58,60,62Ni)have
been smeared with Gaussians of standard devia-
tion of 1.77 MeV to account for the ﬁnite exper-

14

imental resolution. From the perspective of (n,
p) experiment, the GT+ strength is signiﬁcantly
fragmented over many states, and these distribu-
tions centroids and widths are reproduced very
well in the SMMC approach. Our results for the
total strengths are agreed well with the experimen-
tal data. For example, the renormalized B(GT+)
strengths from SMMC approach are 4.120, 2.682,
4.542, 3.510, 2.410 MeV for 54,56Fe, 58,60,62Ni,
respectively. And the B(GT+) strengths from
experiment are 3.70, 2.601, 4.203, 3.200, 2.600
MeV for the same nuclei, respectively. On the
other hand, for some odd-A nuclei(e.g., 51V, 59Co,
55Mn), SMMC results from the (n, p) direction
are also in good agreement with the data of ex-
periment (Alford et al. 1993; El-Kateb et al. 1994;
Rapaport et al. 1984).

The structure and composition of the crust is
important in the thermal and magnetic evolution
of neutron stars. The SMFs not only strongly in-
ﬂuence on the weak interaction rates and NELRs,
but also inﬂuence the late evolution and deter-
mine the core entropy and electron to baryon ra-
tio of magnetars. Tables 1-2 display our results of
the maximum value of NELRs when 10 < B12 <
1000 in diﬀerent astrophysical environments. We
ﬁnd the maximum value of the NELRs will get
to 5.694 × 107, 7.942 × 107, 7.760 × 107, 6.376 ×
107, 6.444×107, 6.567×107, 6.701×107, 6.068×107
when B12 = 103 at relatively low temperature and
high density surrounding (i.e. ρ7 = 106, T9 =
0.233) for 56Fe, 55,56,57,58Co, 56,57Ni, and 48V, re-
spectively. Nevertheless, under relativistic high
temperature and high density surrounding (i.e.
ρ7 = 106, T9 = 15.53), the maximum value of the
NELRs will get to 1.062 × 108, 1.195 × 108 when
B12 = 103 for 54Cr, and 47V, respectively.
According to above discussion, we can draw
a conclusion that the SMFs has a signiﬁcant in-
ﬂuence on the NELRs for a given temperature-
density point. Generally the stronger the den-
sity and the lower the SMFs, the larger aﬀect on
the NELRs becomes. One can also ﬁnd, when
1014G 6 B 6 1016G, for most iron group nuclei,
the rates decrease greatly for a given temperature-
density point. The reason is that the Fermi en-
ergy of electrons decreases, but the binding energy
of the nucleus will increase with the increasing of
SMFs when the temperature and density are con-
stant. Thereby, these lead to more and more elec-

trons whose energy will be less than the threshold
for EC process.

NEL(FFN)), and NKK(λ0

Tables 3-4 display the comparisons of our
results with those of FFN (Fuller et al. 1980,
1982)(λ0
1999) at ρ/µe = 107, T9 = 1, 3. For the case with-
out SMFs, at relativistic low temperature T9 = 1,
One ﬁnds that our rates are about close to ﬁve
orders magnitude lower than FFN (e.g., for 60Ni,
60Co), and NKK(e.g., 57Mn, 55,56Cr). However, at
the relativistic high temperature T9 = 3, our nu-
merical results are in good agreement with those
of NKK, but are about one order magnitude lower
than those of FFN. For the case with SMFs, due to
SMFs, our rates at T9 = 1 can increase by more
than four orders of magnitude when B12 < 102
, and then decrease by more than three orders
of magnitude as the magnetic ﬁelds increases to
B12 = 104. On the other hand, our NELRs for
some iron group nuclei can be about ﬁve orders of
magnitude higher than those of FFN, NKK.

Due to the electron capture Q-value for the
neutron rich nuclide (e.g., 60Fe) has not been
measured, FFN has to use the Seeger & Howard.
(1975) Semiempirical atomic mass formula to es-
timate them. Thus, the Q-value used in the ef-
fective rates are quite diﬀerent. For instance, For
odd-A nuclei (e.g., 59Fe), FFN places the cen-
troid of the GT strength at too low excitation
energies (we can reference the detailed discussed
in Fuller et al. (1982, 1985)). The method for
truncation of a state-density integral for calcula-
tion of the nuclear partition function from FFN’s
work was also criticized by Tubbs & Koonin.
(1979).
So their rates are somewhat overesti-
Some researches (e.g., Langanke et al.

(2001); Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo.
(1998))
showed that the works of FFN are an oversimpliﬁ-
cation and therefore, the accuracy can be limited
due to a so-called Brinks hypothesis was adopted
in their calculations. This hypothesis assumes
that the GT strength distribution on excited states
is the same as for the ground state, only shifted
by the excitation energy of the state. This hy-
pothesis is used by FFN due to no experimental
data is available for the GT strength distributions
from excited states. When FFN calculated the
GT strength functions from excited states, they
seemed not to employ any microscopic theory.

NKK expanded the FFN’s works and analyzed

15

NEL (NKK)) (Nabi & Klapdor-Kleingrothaus

nuclear excitation energy distribution by using the
pn-QRPA theory. The NKK rates are generally
suppressed as compared to the rates of FFN for
the case without SMFs. They had taken into con-
sideration of the particle emission processes, which
constrain the parent excitation energies. By the
pn-QRPA theory, NKK calculated more stronger
GT strength distribution from these excited states
as compared to those assumed from Brink’s hy-
pothesis of FFN. On the other hand, A choice of
particle threshold decay as the cutoﬀ parameter
for parent excitation energy seems to be a reason-
able choice as also discussed earlier by Fuller et al.
(1978). Thus, the parent excitation energy consid-
ered in NKK, are considerably lower as compared
to those of FFN. However in the GT transitions
considered process in NKK, only low angular mo-
mentum states are considered.

The method of SMMC is actually adopted to
analyze the electron capture reaction by an aver-
age of GT intensity distribution. But the calcu-
lated results of NELRs for most nuclei are gen-
erally smaller than other methods, especially for
some odd-A nuclides(e.g., 59,60Fe). The charge ex-
change reactions (p, n) and (n, p) make it pos-
sible to observe in the process of weak interac-
tion, especial for the information of the total GT
strength distribution in nuclei. The experimen-
tal information is particularly rich for some iron
group nuclei and it is the availability of both GT+
and GT−, which makes it possible to study in de-
tail the problem of renormalization of στ opera-
tors. We have calculated the total GT strength in
a full p-f shell calculation, resulting in B(GT) =
g2
A|h~στ+i|2, where g2
A is axial-vector coupling con-
stant. For example,
in magnetars the electron
capture on 59Fe is dominated by the wave func-
tions of the parent and daughter states. The total
GT strength for 59Fe in a full p-f shell calculation,
is resulting in B(GT) = 10.1g2
A (Langanke et al.
2001; Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo. 1998). For
instance, the total GT strength of the other im-
portant nuclide 56Fe and 56Ni in a full pf -shell
calculation can be found in the Ref. (Dean et al.
1998). An average of the GT strength distribution
is in fact obtained by SMMC method. A reliable
replication of the GT distribution in the nucleus
is carried out and detailed analysis by using an
ampliﬁcation of the electronic shell model. Thus
the method is relative accuracy.

In summary, by analyzing the inﬂuence on
NELRs of SMFs in the surface of magnetars. One
can see that the SMFs has an signiﬁcantly eﬀect
on NELRs for diﬀerent nuclides, particularly for
some heavier nuclides, whose threshold is negative
at higher density. According to above calculations
and discussion, one concludes that the NELRs can
increase by more than four orders magnitude. As
the magnetic ﬁelds increases, the NELRs decreases
greatly by more than three orders magnitude. On
the other hand, we compared our results in SMFs
with those of FFN, and NKK. For the case without
SMFs, One ﬁnds that our rates are about close to
ﬁve orders magnitude lower than FFN, and NKK
at relativistic low temperature T9 = 1. However,
at the relativistic high temperature T9 = 3, our
results are in good agreement with those of NKK,
but about one order magnitude lower than those
of FFN. For the case with SMFs, our NELRs for
some iron group nuclei can be about ﬁve orders of
magnitude higher than those of FFN, and NKK.

5. Conclusions and outlooks

The properties of matter in magnetars surface
about SMFs has always been an interesting and
challenging subject for physicists. It is obviously
an important component of neutron star research
for the matter in strong magnetic ﬁelds. In partic-
ular, some thermal and magnetic evolution from
cooling of neutron stars require a detailed the-
oretical understanding of the physical properties
of highly-magnetized atoms, molecules, and con-
densed matter. In this paper, we have focused on
the electronic structure and the properties of mat-
ter in SMFs in magnetars. We have also discussed
the inﬂuences of SMFs on electron Fermi energy,
blinding energy per nuclei, and single-particle level
structure in magnetars surface based on the rela-
tivistic mean-ﬁeld eﬀective interactions theory. By
using the method of SMMC, and the RPA theory,
we detailed analyze the NELRs by EC process of
iron group nuclei. We also compare our results in
SMFs with those of FFN, and NKK, which are in
the case without SMFs.

Firstly, we analyse the inﬂuence of the SMFs
on NELRs when temperature and density are con-
stant in the process of EC. We ﬁnd the inﬂuence
of SMFs on NELRs is very obvious and signiﬁ-
cant. At T9 = 0.233, when B12 < 100, the SMFs

has a slight inﬂuence on the NELRs for most nu-
clides. Nevertheless, the NELRs increases by more
than four orders of magnitude at T9 = 15.53 when
B12 < 100. And then, the NELRs rates decrease
by more than three orders of magnitude when
B12 > 100 at relatively high temperature (e.g.,
at T9 = 15.53 for 52−61Fe, 55−60Co and 56−63Ni).
Secondly, we also discuss the inﬂuence of den-
sity on NELRs at diﬀerent temperature and mag-
netic ﬁelds point in the process of EC. One ﬁnds
that the NELRs increase greatly and even exceed
by four orders of magnitude for a certain value of
magnetic ﬁeld and temperature. With increasing
of the density, there are almost not inﬂuence of
density on NELRs. On the other hand, for the
density around ρ7 = 102, there is an abrupt in-
crease in NELRs when B12 ≥ 103.5. Such jumps
are an indication that the underlying shell struc-
ture has changed in a fundamental way due to
single-particle behavior by SMFs.

Finally, we compare our results with those of
FFN, NKK due to diﬀerent methods for calcu-
lating the NELRs. For the case without SMFs,
one ﬁnds that our rates are about close to ﬁve
orders magnitude lower than FFN, and NKK at
relativistic low temperature T9 = 1. However, at
the relativistic high temperature T9 = 3, our re-
sults are in good agreement with those of NKK,
but about one order magnitude lower than those
of FFN. For the case with SMFs, our NELRs for
some iron group nuclei can be about ﬁve orders of
magnitude higher than those of FFN, and NKK.
On the other hand, The composition, and its
structure at the outer crust of magnetar is fun-
damentally determined by the energies of isolated
nuclei, such as the blinding energy, the kinetic en-
ergy of electrons and the lattice energy. We dis-
cuss the inﬂuence of SMFs on the binding energy
of the nuclei, single-particle level structure, and
electron Fermi energy. One ﬁnds that the NELRs
increases due to increase of the electron Fermi en-
ergy, and the change of single-particle level struc-
ture by SMFs. On the contrary, the NELRs de-
creases due to increase of the binding energy of
the nuclei by SMFs.

As we all know, the NELRs by EC play an im-
portant role in the dynamics process and cooling
mechanism of magnetars. The NELRs also is a
main parameter, which leads to thermal evolu-
tion and magnetic evolution of magnetars. Re-

cent studies have shown that the observations of
magnetars suggest that the luminosity of persis-
tent X-ray radiated from magnetars is likely from
the radiation of thermal origin, such as heating
by magnetospheric current, or by EC in the outer
crust. The heat released due to EC for some iron
group nuclei on magnetars surface maybe balance
both surface and inner temperatures of a magne-
tar in diﬀerent degrees. However, the consider-
able mechanism of the X-ray source is not clear
up to now. How to inﬂuence of SMFs on soft X-
ray emission, which is the possible origins of the
NELRs in magnetar? How to understand the na-
ture of the cooling from NELRs in magnetar? How
to inﬂuence the NELRs in the process of EC by
SMFs when the magnetic pressure decreases and
the crust shrinks, the density and electron Fermi
energy increase? These problem of SMFs in mag-
netars have always been the interesting and chal-
lenging issue. Our conclusions may be helpful to
the investigation of the thermal evolution, the nu-
cleosyntheses of heavy elements, and the numer-
ical calculations, and simulation of the neutron
stars, and magnetars.
