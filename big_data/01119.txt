ABSTRACT

Context. Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to probe the internal rotation proﬁle of low-mass (≈ 1.1–
1.5 M⊙) subgiant and red giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation, the core contraction and
envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main sequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than observed.
This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking place in the interior of these stars.
Aims. We investigate the physical nature of the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar interiors by
constraining the efﬁciency of post-main sequence rotational coupling.
Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 M⊙ star using the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take
into account the magnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular momentum transport in the interior, with
an efﬁciency dependent on the degree of internal differential rotation.
Results. We ﬁnd that models including a dependence of the angular momentum transport efﬁciency on the radial rotational shear
reproduce very well the observations. The best ﬁt of the data is obtained with an angular momentum transport coefﬁcient scaling with
the ratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the convective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ≈ 3.
This scaling is consistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability.
Conclusions. We show that an angular momentum transport process whose efﬁciency varies during the stellar evolution through a
dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required to explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of
low-mass stars.

1. Introduction

Rotation is a very important property of stars, as it can signiﬁ-
cantly affect stellar structure and evolution in a variety of ways
(e.g., directly, Sills et al. 2000; by enhancing element mixing,
Pinsonneault 1997; by powering dynamo action and magnetic
activity, Noyes et al. 1984).

Solar-like stars show a signiﬁcant rotational evolution dur-
ing their pre-main sequence (PMS) and main sequence (MS)
lifetime and beyond, as their magnetized stellar winds effec-
tively drain angular momentum from their surfaces (Schatzman,
1962; Kraft, 1967; Skumanich, 1972). Simple rotational evolu-
tion models can reproduce the basic features of this spin-down
(see, e.g., Gallet & Bouvier, 2013), when also taking into ac-
count the occurrence of structural readjustments (e.g., the grad-
ual development of an inner radiative zone during PMS contrac-
tion), and of angular momentum transport within the interior,
typically ensuring an efﬁcient rotational coupling within a time
scale of a few hundreds of Myr (see also MacGregor & Brenner,
1991; Denissenkov et al., 2010; Spada et al., 2011).

Although it has been possible to measure the surface rota-
tion of stars for a long time (see, e.g., Kraft, 1970, and refer-
ences therein), much less is known about the rotational state
of stellar interiors. Through helioseimology, the solar rotation

proﬁle has been mapped from the surface down to ≈ 0.2 so-
lar radii (Schou et al., 1998; Howe, 2009), showing a remark-
ably low radial differential rotation; similarly, using asteroseis-
mic techniques, it has recently become possible to place con-
straints on the radial differential rotation in the interior of other
stars. The analysis of the rotational splittings carried out on six
solar-like stars by Nielsen et al. (2014) ruled out strong radial
rotational gradients. Similarly, Benomar et al. (2015) reported
ratios of interior to surface rotation rates smaller than a fac-
tor of 2 in a sample of stars of mass between 1.1 and 1.6 M⊙,
independently of their age. Quantitative constraints on the de-
gree of internal differential rotation can also be placed for stars
sufﬁciently evolved to show mixed modes (Dupret et al., 2009;
Beck et al., 2012; Deheuvels et al., 2012; Mosser et al., 2012;
Deheuvels et al., 2014).

Observations thus strongly support an efﬁcient angu-
low- and
lar momentum redistribution in the interior of
intermediate-mass stars,
leading to a state of almost uni-
form rotation within the mature stages of their MS life-
time. The physical nature of the processes responsible for
this rotational coupling, however, remains elusive. Both in-
ternal gravity waves
for a review),
and magnetic ﬁelds (e.g., Charbonneau & MacGregor, 1993;
R¨udiger & Kitchatinov, 1996) have been proposed as viable

(see Mathis, 2013,

mechanisms to redistribute angular momentum in the interior of
MS stars.

The rotational evolution beyond the TAMS is equally non-
trivial. As the stellar core contracts and the envelope expands at
the end of the hydrogen burning phase, local angular momentum
conservation would require the development of a strong differen-
tial rotation. The moderate differential rotation observed in KIC
7341231 (Deheuvels et al., 2012) or KIC 8366239 (Beck et al.,
2012) is incompatible with this scenario, suggesting that efﬁ-
cient angular momentum transport is taking place during the
post-main sequence (poMS) phase as well. Purely hydrodynam-
ical effects, such as meridional circulation and the shear instabil-
ity, have been shown to be insufﬁcient to reconcile the theoretical
models with this observed behavior (Eggenberger et al., 2012;
Ceillier et al., 2013; Marques et al., 2013). Models including an-
gular momentum transport mediated by the so-called Tayler-
Spruit Dynamo (Cantiello et al., 2014) and by gravity waves
(Fuller et al., 2014) also produce too fast core rotation in sub-
giants in comparison with the observations.

The stars in the samples of Deheuvels et al. (2014, hereafter
D+14) and Mosser et al. (2012, M+12 in the following), com-
bined together, offer the unique opportunity to trace the evolu-
tion of core–envelope differential rotation from immediately af-
ter the TAMS to the giant branch stage.

In this work, we focus on modeling the poMS rota-
tional evolution of stars of approximately solar mass (M .
1.5 M⊙), using the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code
(YREC; Pinsonneault et al., 1989; Demarque et al., 2008). In
particular, motivated by the results of recent numerical simula-
tions of the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability (AMRI;
R¨udiger et al. 2015, Gellert et al., in preparation), we wish to test
the dependence of the angular momentum transport efﬁciency on
the degree of internal differential rotation.

The AMRI is a destabilization of hydrodynamically sta-
ble differential rotation by current-free toroidal magnetic ﬁelds
(R¨udiger et al., 2007). In contrast to the magneto-rotational in-
stability of an axial ﬁeld (see Velikhov, 1959), it is naturally non-
axisymmetric. The instability extracts its energy from the differ-
ential rotation, thus working more effectively for steeper rotation
proﬁles, and disappearing in the presence of solid-body rotation.
The turbulent viscosity generated by the AMRI can be very ef-
fective at transporting angular momentum (R¨udiger et al., 2015),
with the magnetic contribution due to Maxwell stresses strongly
dominating over the kinetic component. As a consequence, mix-
ing is much less enhanced by the AMRI than angular momen-
tum transport, and the Schmidt number (the ratio of turbulent
viscosity and turbulent element diffusion coefﬁcient) is large
enough not to speed up stellar evolution signiﬁcantly Schatzman
(1977); Lebreton & Maeder (1987); Brott et al. (2008). A dis-
tinctive property of the AMRI-induced viscosity is its depen-
dence on the angular velocity shear present in the region where
the instability develops. As a consequence, the time scale for the
quenching of the differential rotation is not constant in time, but
increases as the rotation proﬁle becomes ﬂatter. This is a speciﬁc
prediction that can be tested using our formulation.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce
the data used to constrain our models; in Section 3 we describe
our models and the implementation of the turbulent angular mo-
mentum diffusion dependent on the internal differential rotation.
Our results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section
5. We summarize our conclusions in Section 6.

2. Asteroseismic constraints on poMS rotational

coupling

We consider asteroseismic constraints on the poMS rotational
evolution of low-mass stars from the following two studies (see
Figure 1).

The D+14 sample contains six stars of mass between 1.1 and
1.5 M⊙ and approximately solar composition. For these stars,
the surface gravity, log g, and the core and envelope angular ve-
locities, Ωg and Ωp (ﬁlled and empty circles, respectively), have
been determined from individual asteroseismic modelling (here
we loosely refer to the rotation rate averaged over the g-mode
and the p-mode cavities, respectively, as “core” and “envelope”
rotation rates; see section 6 of D+14 for more details). These
stars apparently possess some degree of internal differential ro-
tation, with a ratio Ωg/Ωp in the range 2.5–20, which increases
with decreasing log g, i.e., while the stars evolve away from the
MS towards the red giant branch.

For the stars in the M+12 sample, values of log g and Ωg ob-
tained from the ensemble asteroseismology technique (see their
paper for details) are available. This sample contains stars whose
evolutionary stage ranges from the early red giant to the red
clump. While the red giants (diamond symbols in Figure 1) are
roughly in the same mass range as those of the D+14 sample,
the clump stars (triangle symbols) are much less homogeneous
in mass, containing both low- and intermediate mass stars. For
this reason, only the red giants of the M+12 sample will be con-
sidered here.

These two samples offer the possibility of a quantitative
comparison between observed and modeled Ωg/Ωp as a func-
tion of log g, to constrain the efﬁciency of internal angular mo-
mentum transport through the poMS evolution. As can be seen
from Figure 1, after the TAMS a transition from the core spin-
up of the subgiants to core spin-down among the red giants is
observed.

In the following, we will compare the observed Ωg and Ωp
with the average rotation rates over the radiative interior and the
convective envelope, Ωrad and Ωenv respectively, extracted from
our models. It should be noted, however, that the g-mode cavity
covers only part of the radiative interior, and therefore Ωg does

not exactly translate to Ωrad. We will neglect this effect from
now on (see the discussion in section 6 of D+14 for details).

3. Modeling poMS rotational evolution of

low-mass stars

3.1. The stellar evolution code

The models discussed here were constructed using the YREC
stellar evolution code (see Demarque et al. 2008, for a descrip-
tion of its non-rotational conﬁguration, and Endal & Soﬁa 1976;
Pinsonneault et al. 1989, for the treatment of rotation-related
physics).

(Rogers & Nayfonov, 2002), and the OPAL Rosseland opacities
(Iglesias & Rogers, 1996), complemented by the Ferguson et al.
(2005) opacities at low temperatures; the nuclear energy gener-
ation rates are those recommended by Adelberger et al. (2011).
The surface boundary conditions are based on the classical
Eddington gray T –τ relationship. Convection is described with
the mixing length theory (B¨ohm-Vitense, 1958). We adopt
the Grevesse & Noels (1993) value of the solar metallicity,
(Z/X)⊙ = 0.0245. The resulting solar-calibrated value of
the mixing length parameter (the ratio of the mixing length
over the pressure scale height) is α = 1.832, which is adopted
throughout in our modeling. To keep the number of parameters
to a minimum, the effect of elements diffusion and convective
core overshooting are ignored (see Marques et al., 2013, for
a discussion of the effects of microphysics on the angular
momentum transport).

In rotating models, the effect of rotation on the stellar struc-
ture, the angular momentum loss from the surface (if present),
and the internal redistribution of angular momentum must also
be taken into account.

In the treatment of the structural effects of rotation (i.e., in-
crease in effective temperature, decrease in luminosity, increase
of the MS lifetimes) we follow the standard YREC implemen-
tation. These effects are quite small in low-mass stars (see, e.g.,
ﬁgures 4 and 5 of Sills et al. 2000).

For the wind braking we adopt

the parametrization of

Kawaler (1988):

(cid:18) dJ
dt (cid:19)wind

= KW (cid:18) R∗/R⊙

M∗/M⊙(cid:19)1/2

Ω3
∗,

(1)

where R∗, M∗, Ω∗ are the radius, mass, and surface rotation
rate of the star, and the overall scaling factor KW is an ad-
∗ of equation (1) re-
justable parameter. The dependence on Ω3
sults in an asymptotic rotational evolution that follows the em-
pirically well-supported Prot ∝ t1/2 relation, where Prot is the
surface rotation period of the star and t its age (Skumanich,
1972). The second factor to the right hand side of equation (1),
containing R∗ and M∗, has been shown not to capture the full
mass dependence of the wind braking phenomenon as observed
in young open clusters (see Barnes & Kim, 2010; Barnes, 2010;
Meibom et al., 2015; Lanzafame & Spada, 2015, for details). To
compensate for the incorrect mass dependence in equation (1),
Chaboyer et al. (1995a,b) introduced a “saturation phase”, of
mass-dependent duration (during which ˙Jwind ∝ Ω∗). However,
since for a star of mass & 1.1 M⊙ the saturation phase only lasts
for the ﬁrst few Myr of the MS rotational evolution, to keep the
number of parameters to a minimum we absorb both the satu-
ration effect and the residual mass dependence of equation (1)
within KW , and retain it as the only freely adjustable parameter.

In the following, to keep KW of the order of unity for conve-
nience, we scale it over 1.13 · 1047 g cm2s, the value recom-
mended by Kawaler (1988).

We describe the radial transport of angular momentum in the

stellar interiors as a diffusion process:

ρr4 ∂Ω
∂t

=

∂

∂r (cid:20)ρr4D

∂Ω

∂r (cid:21) ,

(2)

where Ω(r, t) is the angular velocity, ρ is the density, and D is
the angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient. Note that the values
of D adopted in the following are in any case representative of a
turbulent process (i.e., much stronger than those resulting from
just the molecular viscosity). Solid-body rotation is enforced at
all times within convective zones, as their typical mixing time
scales are much faster than the processes discussed here. The
generation of latitudinal shear in convection zones does not af-
fect their total angular momentum, and is therefore not relevant
to our model.

In the standard version of YREC, the coefﬁcient D is cal-
culated at each evolutionary time step by taking into account
several hydrodynamical instabilities (Pinsonneault et al., 1989).
Purely hydrodynamic instabilities, however, have already been
shown not to be sufﬁciently effective at transporting angu-
lar momentum to explain the internal rotation of red giants
(Eggenberger et al., 2012; Ceillier et al., 2013; Marques et al.,
2013). For this reason, here we follow a different approach. We
explore a simple, power law dependence of D on the internal dif-
ferential rotation, as measured by the ratio of the average angular
velocity of the radiative interior, Ωrad, over that of the convective
envelope, Ωenv:

D = D0 (cid:18) Ωrad

Ωenv(cid:19)α

.

(3)

In the equation above, D0 and α are parameters to be determined
that set the overall scale factor and the sensitivity of the depen-
dence on the internal differential rotation, respectively. A pos-
sible physical interpretation of such a dependence will be pro-
posed in Section 5.

By determining the value of α that leads to the best agree-
ment of the models with the data, we can obtain useful clues
on the physical nature of the rotational coupling mechanisms in
poMS stars.

3.2. The solar benchmark

In order to set baseline values of the constants KW and D0, we
apply the constant D prescription, i.e., α = 0 in equation (3), to
the MS rotational evolution of the Sun.

From the full solution for Ω(r, t) obtained for a 1 M⊙ model,
we extract the average rotation rate of the radiative and convec-
tive zones, Ωrad(t) and Ωenv(t), as a function of time. Simple,
unweighted averages over the mass shells belonging to the ra-
diative interior and to the convective envelope, respectively, are
used.

The initial conditions are chosen such that the period at 1
Myr is 8 days. This choice roughly coincides with the median
of the observed period distribution in the Orion Nebula Cluster
(ONC; Rebull, 2001). We adjust the values of KW and D0 in
order to satisfy the following constraints, which are meant to
represent the present solar rotation (e.g., Schou et al., 1998):

Ωenv(t⊙) = 1.0 Ω⊙ ; Ωrad(t⊙)/Ωenv(t⊙) = 1.02,

and the red giants from M+12 (diamonds). The broken line is a

where t⊙ = 4.57 Gyr and Ω⊙ = 2.78 · 10−6 s−1. The value
adopted for Ωrad(t⊙)/Ωenv(t⊙) was estimated via numerical in-
tegration, using the ﬁt of the solar rotation proﬁle given by equa-
tions (14) and (15) of Roxburgh (2001). We thus obtain:

KW,⊙ = 3.2; D0,⊙ = 2.5 · 105 cm2s−1.

The parameter KW is mostly determined by the condition on
Ωenv(t⊙), but it is also moderately sensitive to the behavior of
internal differential rotation. For comparison, solid-body rota-
tion is enforced at all times during the evolution if D0 & 106

solar calibration gives KW,⊙ = 2.9.

4. Results
We model the poMS rotational evolution of a solar composition,
1.25 M⊙ star. This choice of parameters is assumed to be repre-
sentative of both the D+14 sample and of the red giants in the
M+12 sample. Modelling the red clump stars of M+12 is out-
side the aims of this paper; more massive stars, such as those in
the sample of Deheuvels et al. (2015), will be the subject of a
subsequent investigation.

4.1. Evolution of Ωenv and calibration of Kw
The rotational evolution is an initial value problem, requiring
suitable initial conditions. We evolve our 1.25 M⊙ model
starting from the early PMS (age . 1 Myr). This choice has
several advantages: since the initial model is fully convective,
we can assume it has a solid-body rotation proﬁle; moreover,

due to the strong convergence properties of the Ω dependence
in equation (1), the subsequent evolution is not too sensitive
to the details of the initial conditions. Similarly to the solar
benchmark model discussed in Section 3.2, the initial period
is assigned so that the period at the age of 1 Myr is 8 days.
This is still compatible with the observed rotation period
distribution in ONC (Rebull, 2001), at least within the level of
accuracy with which its mass dependence is currently known.
Furthermore, rigid rotation within the model is enforced until
the end of the MS (i.e., until the central hydrogen abundance
drops below ≈ 10−4). Indeed, theoretical models of stars of
mass & 1 M⊙ predict that they attain a quasi-rigid rotation
state by the time they have reached their mature MS (i.e.,
once they are older than ≈ 1 Gyr: see Gallet & Bouvier, 2013;
Lanzafame & Spada, 2015). This is also observed in the Sun and
in other solar-like stars (Nielsen et al., 2014; Benomar et al.,
2015). Our poMS rotational evolution modeling thus begins

4

F. Spada, M. Gellert, R. Arlt and S. Deheuvels: Angular momentum transport efﬁciency in post-main sequence low-mass stars

from a (realistic) state of negligible internal differential rotation.
At the same time, the problem at hand has been effectively
decoupled from the MS rotational evolution problem, where
angular momentum redistribution is a highly debated, currently
(e.g. Charbonneau & MacGregor,
unsettled issue in itself
1993; R¨udiger & Kitchatinov,
2008;
Garaud & Garaud, 2008; Denissenkov et al., 2010).

1996; Mathis et al.,

The parameter KW can be ﬁxed by requiring that the evolu-
tion of Ωenv(t) extracted from the models matches that of Ωp of
the subgiants in the log g-Ω plane. As can be seen from Figure 2,
adjusting the single parameter KW produces a remarkably good
ﬁt of all the Ωp in the D+14 sample. This implies that the surface
spin-down of these subgiants is still in the Skumanich regime
(i.e., P ∝ t1/2).

The calibration of KW depends on the mass of the model, but
is insensitive to the value of D0, as can be seen from the overlap
of the Ωenv evolutions plotted in Figure 2, or even to the pre-
scription used for the angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient
(compare Figure 2 with Figures 3 and 4). For M∗ = 1.25 M⊙
we obtain KW = 0.8. This value of KW is kept ﬁxed in all the
following calculations.

4.2. Constant angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient

We ﬁrst discuss models with a diffusion coefﬁcient independent
of differential rotation (i.e., α = 0 in equation 3). The resulting
poMS rotational evolution for several values of D0 is shown in
Figure 2.

From the Figure we can draw two main conclusions: ﬁrst,
although the overall behavior is not captured at all, values of
D0 ≈ 104 cm2s−1 roughly match the order of magnitude of
both the subgiants and the red giants core rotation (for com-
parison, the typical value of the molecular viscosity in the ra-
diative zone is 2–20 cm2s−1). This is signiﬁcantly smaller than
what is required during the MS evolution of the Sun to match
the helioseismic constraints (by a factor of 25 according to our
estimate of Section 3.2), but comparable to the value found by
Eggenberger et al. (2012) for KIC 8366239 (3 · 104 cm2s−1). In
other words, the poMS angular momentum transport is, over-
all, less efﬁcient than during the MS (see also the discussion in
Tayar & Pinsonneault, 2013).

Secondly, as was already noted by Cantiello et al. (2014),
with a constant angular momentum diffusion efﬁciency it is im-
possible to satisfactorily reproduce both the subgiant core spin-
up and the subsequent spin-down occurring during the red giant
phase. The small value of D0 required to allow the development
of internal differential rotation shortly after the TAMS results
in a strong monotonic increase of the core rotation rate at later
times, at odds with the trend observed in the M+12 red giants.

4.3. Angular momentum diffusion dependent on

differential rotation

We now discuss the effect of a dependence of the angular mo-
mentum diffusion coefﬁcient on the degree of internal differen-
tial rotation, in the form of equation (3). The resulting poMS
rotational evolutions for α = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are shown in the
upper panel of Figure 3. At ﬁrst, we do not attempt to ﬁt the ro-
tational evolution of the subgiants in detail, but rather the overall
spin-up of the core during the subgiant phase, as represented by
the most evolved star of the D+14 sample, and the subsequent
core spin-down. This calibration ﬁxes the value of D0, given
α. A more satisfactory ﬁt of all the stars in the D+14 sample

Fig. 4. As in Figure 3, but showing models kept in a state of
rigid rotation until approximately 1 Gyr after the TAMS. Upper
panel: poMS rotational evolution for various values of α. For
each α, D0 has been calibrated to obtain an optimal ﬁt of both
the subgiants and the red giants. Lower panel: the evolution of
the angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient according to equa-
tion (3).

will be presented in Section 4.4. The lower panel of the Figure
shows the corresponding evolution of D according to equation
(3). Note that, as a result of the calibration of D0 chosen, the dif-
fusion coefﬁcient has approximately the same value (≈ 4.5 · 103
cm2s−1) around log g = 3.8 in all the models.

The rotational evolution from the early red giant phase on-
wards (log g . 3.5) is very sensitive to α. Qualitatively, the
slope of the ﬁt to the red giants trend (shown as a broken line
in the Figure) is best reproduced with α ≈ 3.

4.4. Prolonged post-TAMS solid-body rotation phase

Introducing a dependence of the angular momentum diffusion
coefﬁcient on the internal differential rotation according to equa-
tion (3) allows the models to reproduce quite well the core spin-
down trend on the red giant branch. The agreement with the sub-
giant data is, however, not equally satisfactory. From Figures 2
and 3 it is apparent that, as soon as the solid-body rotation con-

5

bulent process (i.e., it is enhanced compared to the molecular
viscosity) and it is not constant in time. The models including a
power law dependence of the angular momentum diffusion co-
efﬁcient on the ratio Ωrad/Ωenv (see equation 3) can reproduce
this behavior with D0 ≈ 1 and α ≈ 3. As the lower panels
of Figures 3 and 4 show, D becomes essentially independent of
D0 and α during the red giant evolution for α & 2. This is a
consequence of the differential rotation feedback introduced by
equation (3), which allows the angular momentum transport ef-
ﬁciency to regulate itself and to reach a quasi-stationary state.

Various angular momentum transport processes in stellar in-
teriors depend on the internal shear: for example, purely hydro-
dynamic instabilities, such as the dynamical and secular shear
instability (e.g., Zahn, 1974), or magnetohydrodynamic instabil-
ities, such as the Tayler instability (Tayler, 1957, 1973) or the
AMRI (R¨udiger et al., 2007, 2015).

For the AMRI, in particular, a scaling of the turbulent vis-
cosity in terms of dimensionless numbers has been established
through direct numerical simulations performed in a Taylor-
Couette cylindrical setup, taking into account the thermal strat-
iﬁcation of the background ﬂuid (Gellert et al., in preparation).
According to these simulations, the enhancement of the turbu-
lent viscosity with respect to its molecular value, νT /ν, is given
by:

νT
ν

∝ r Pm

Ra

where Pm ≡ ν/η is the Prandtl number, Re ≡ ΩiRi(Ro −
Ri)/ν the Reynolds number, Ra ≡ Q g (To−Ti) (Ro−Ri)3/νχ
the Rayleigh number, and µΩ ≡ Ωo/Ωi. In the previous deﬁni-
tions, g is the acceleration of gravity, η the magnetic diffusivity,
χ the thermal conductivity, and Q the thermal expansion coef-
ﬁcient of the ﬂuid; Ri, Ti, Ωi and Ro, To, Ωo are the radius,
temperature, and angular velocity at the inner and outer bound-
ary of the simulation domain, respectively. The dependence of
νT /ν on rotation only is thus:

νT

Since, as was shown in Section 4, our best-ﬁtting model requires
D ∝ (Ωrad/Ωenv)α with α ≈ 3, and D becomes almost inde-
pendent of α on the red giant branch for α & 2 (see Figure 4),
we suggest the loose identiﬁcation Ωi ≈ Ωrad and Ωo ≈ Ωenv.
It must be emphasized, however, that, although the effec-
tiveness of angular momentum transport by the AMRI in a
chemically homogeneous ﬂuid has been shown by R¨udiger et al.
(2015), it is possible that the strong molecular weight gradient
that develops in the core of a poMS star suppresses the insta-
bility. To assess the importance of this effect, the proﬁle of the
mean molecular weight µ ≈ (2X + 3
2 Z)−1 in the interior
of our reference 1.25 M⊙ model at three different evolutionary
stages is plotted in Figure 6. The proﬁles shown in the Figure
roughly correspond to models right after the TAMS, and in the
subgiant and red giant stages. As expected, the mean molecular
weight ranges from µ ≈ 1.33 to µ ≈ 0.6 within the He core
and in the convection zone, respectively. The strongest gradient
is found at the transition between the pure helium core and the
rest of the star. Clearly, more extensive numerical and modeling
work, taking into account the effect of µ gradients directly, is
required to put the identiﬁcation suggested above between our
heuristic scaling (3) and equation (4) on ﬁrmer ground.

A satisfactory agreement of our models with both the sub-
giants in the D+14 sample and the red giants in the M+12 sam-

straint is relaxed, Ωrad and Ωenv decouple very quickly, and the
values of D0 required by the overall ﬁt allow the ratio Ωrad/Ωenv
to reach too large values in comparison with the youngest star in
the D+14 sample.

In the models shown so far, a solid-body rotation proﬁle is
artiﬁcially enforced until the TAMS. In this Section, we explore
the possibility of a prolonged rigid rotation phase extending
beyond the TAMS, of adjustable duration. Indeed, as was dis-
cussed in the Introduction, there are good theoretical and obser-
vational reasons (Gallet & Bouvier, 2013; Lanzafame & Spada,
2015; Nielsen et al., 2014; Benomar et al., 2015) to assume that
stars of mass & 1 M⊙ attain a rotationally coupled state on their
mature main sequence. There are, however, no constraints on
whether this state should cease immediately at the end of core
hydrogen burning or last longer.

In Figure 4 we plot the results obtained with a prolonged
rigid rotation phase. The best agreement with the D+14 sub-
giants is found when enforcing solid-body rotation until the age
of ≈ 4.8 Gyr. This roughly corresponds to the age at which shell
hydrogen burning has become well established (see Figure 5).
For future reference, this occurs when the stellar radius has ex-
panded to ≈ 2.16 R⊙, or about 1 Gyr after the end of core hydro-
gen burning. Both α = 0 and α = 1, 2, 3, 4 models are shown in
Figure 4. This time, for each value of α, D0 has been calibrated
to optimize the overall ﬁt. The lower panel of Figure 4 shows the
corresponding evolution of the angular momentum diffusion co-
efﬁcient D. Note that the tuned values of D0 reported in Figure
4 are smaller by a factor of ≈ 3 than those in Figure 3. This is
due to the prolonged rigid rotation phase that results in a weaker
differential rotation to be quenched afterwards.

A remarkable agreement with the data, from the subgiants all
the way to the red giant branch, is achieved for α ≈ 3, D0 ≈ 1
cm2s−1.

5. Discussion
The results of the previous section show that, during the poMS
evolution of low-mass stars, the rotational coupling efﬁciency re-
quired to explain the observations is compatible with some tur-

most of the shear develops1. As a crude estimate, we ﬁnd that
on a typical evolution, and considering an overshooting of 0.20
pressure scale heights at the bottom of the outer convection zone,
the overshooting layer is less than ≈ 20% of the radial extension
of the shear region. This is not enough to change the qualitative
picture of the evolution from the subgiant through the red giant
stages.

ple can only be obtained by assuming that the solid-body rota-
tion regime achieved during the mature MS continues to hold
until the nuclear energy source of the model has shifted from
core to shell hydrogen burning. This occurs about 1 Gyr after the
TAMS in our 1.25 M⊙ model. Since there are currently no ob-
servational constraints on this issue, we can only propose some
theoretical arguments. The two leading explanations for the cou-
pling in the interior of low-mass MS stars are magnetic ﬁelds
(e.g., R¨udiger & Kitchatinov, 1996) and internal gravity waves
(e.g., Mathis et al., 2008). In the case of the former, it is plausi-
ble that the action of magnetic ﬁelds continues beyond the end of
the hydrogen burning phase, and becomes ineffective only when
the star has undergone signiﬁcant structural changes evolving
towards the red giant branch. For the latter, Fuller et al. (2014)
have shown that internal gravity waves can affect internal rota-
tion on a short (≈ 100 Myr) time scale on the MS, but that this
time scale progressively increases, eventually leading to a de-
coupling between the stellar core and envelope. They estimated
that, for low-mass stars (M . 1.5 M⊙), this occurs when the
stellar radius has increased to about 1.75 times the MS radius.
This is in very good agreement with our prolonged solid-body
rotation scenario discussed in Section 4.4, where the strong cou-
pling regime was assumed to last until R∗ ≈ 2.16 R⊙ (note that
our 1.25 M⊙ model has a MS radius of about 1.2 R⊙). Either
way, we could speculate that differential rotation begins to de-
velop at some point after the TAMS, during the subgiant/early
red giant phase, until angular momentum redistribution is taken
over by some other, dominant process during the poMS.

Finally, we note that the overshooting at the bottom of the
surface convection zone, which has been ignored in our calcu-
lations, could have a signiﬁcant impact on our results if it can
bring the bottom of the outer convection zone close enough to
the hydrogen-burning shell, bridging the gap of the region where

6. Conclusions
We have discussed poMS rotational evolution models for a solar
composition, 1.25 M⊙ star, representative of the low-mass com-
ponent (1.0 . M/M⊙ . 1.5) of the asteroseismic analyses of
Deheuvels et al. (2014) and Mosser et al. (2012).

The models include a standard parametrization of the brak-
ing of the stellar surface due to the magnetized stellar winds.
Angular momentum transport in the interior is treated as a dif-
fusion process, implementing a simple formulation for a depen-
dence of the diffusion coefﬁcient on the internal differential ro-
tation.

Our main conclusions are the following:

1. Angular momentum transport in the early poMS is less ef-
ﬁcient, by more than one order of magnitude, than that re-
quired for the PMS and MS evolution of the Sun to match
the helioseismic constraints;

2. Assuming an angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient con-
stant in time results in a monotonic spin-up of the stellar
core from the subgiant phase onwards, which is incompat-
ible with the available observational constraints;

3. An angular momentum diffusion coefﬁcient dependent on
the internal shear can establish a quasi-stationary core spin-
down regime during the red giant phase, and lead to a rota-
tional evolution in agreement with the observations;

4. Full agreement between models and data from the TAMS all
the way to giant branch evolution (before the red clump) can
be achieved assuming that stars remain in a rigid rotation
state until the shell hydrogen burning phase (≈ 1 Gyr after
the TAMS for a 1.25 M⊙ star).
