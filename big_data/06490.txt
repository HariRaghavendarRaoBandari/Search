Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras
and their derived composition series

Martin Kalck∗

Abstract. We study composition series of derived module categories in the sense of Angeleri H¨ugel, K¨onig
& Liu for quasi-hereditary algebras. More precisely, we show that having a composition series with all
factors being derived categories of vector spaces does not characterise derived categories of quasi-hereditay
algebras. This gives a negative answer to a question of Liu & Yang and the proof also conﬁrms part of a
conjecture of Bobi´nski & Malicki. In another direction, we show that derived categories of quasi-hereditary
algebras can have composition series with lots of diﬀerent lengths and composition factors. In other words,
there is no Jordan-H¨older property for composition series of derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras.

Triangulated categories are used and studied in diﬀerent areas of mathematics and theoretical
physics – algebraic geometry (for example, with applications to classical problems in birational
geometry, see e.g.
[15, 66]), representation theory (with relations to cluster algebras, starting
with [16] and perverse sheaves [7] used in the proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures), algebraic
topology, string theory (via Kontsevich’s Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture [44]), ... . In

general, triangulated categories are rather complicated structures and therefore techniques allow-
ing a decomposition into more accessible pieces are important. In this article, we will focus on
decompositions of triangulated categories T of the form

T ′ ←−→← T ←−→← T ′′

(1.1)

called recollements, which have properties similar to short exact sequences, see the discussion
below. We refer to [7] and Section 2 for the precise deﬁnition.

Quasi-hereditary algebras form an important class of ﬁnite dimensional algebras with relations
to Lie theory (in fact this was the original motivation [63]) and also exceptional sequences in
algebraic geometry (see e.g.
[33] and [17]). The category of ﬁnitely generated modules over a
quasi-hereditary algebra is an example of a highest weight category and conversely, every highest
weight category with ﬁnitely many simple objects is of this form [22, Theorem 3.6]. Highest
weight categories are also discussed in Krause’s article in this volume [45]:
in particular, the
category of strict polynomial functors admits the structure of a highest weight category. Moreover,
work of Dlab & Ringel [26] shows that every ﬁnite dimensional algebra admits a ‘resolution’ by a
quasi-hereditary algebra. A generalisation of this result led to Iyama’s proof of the ﬁniteness of
Auslander’s representation dimension [37]. Examples of quasi-hereditary algebras include blocks
of category O and Schur algebras (see e.g. the articles by Krause & K¨ulshammer in this volume
[45, 46]). It is well-known that quasi-hereditary algebras may be deﬁned in terms of sequences of
recollements of abelian categories, see [56] and also [45].

Recollements of derived categories induce long exact sequences in K-groups (see e.g.

[53]),
Hochschild homology and cyclic homology, see [41, Remark 3.2] for the latter two. They also give
rise to long exact sequences involving Hochschild cohomology groups of all the algebras in the
recollement, see e.g. [30, Corollary 3]. Moreover, recollements of derived module categories allow
to reduce the proof of classical homological conjectures to simpler and smaller algebras, see e.g.
[32]. Also t-structures on T ′ and T ′′ can be glued to a t-structure on T – in fact, this was one of
the main motivations in [7], where recollements arising from stratiﬁcations of topological spaces
where used to construct so called perverse t-structures giving rise to perverse sheaves. Summing
up, recollements behave similar as short exact sequences.

This view was the starting point for a recent series of articles by Angeleri H¨ugel, K¨onig, Liu
(and Yang), see [3, 4, 5], where one can ﬁnd some historical background and also Yang’s ICRA
talk [67]. We give a brief account of part of this work here.

In the presence of a notion of short exact sequence one can deﬁne simple objects as those
which do not appear as middle terms of non-trivial short exact sequences. We call these objects
triangulated simple. In analogy with short exact sequences of modules over rings, iteration (i.e.
taking recollements of the outer terms T ′ and T ′′ in (1.1) and recollements of their outer terms
and so forth until we reach triangulated simple categories) leads to the notion of (triangulated)
composition series (sometimes also called stratiﬁcation of triangulated categories). We call the
triangulated simple categories appearing in this process triangulated composition factors. Angeleri
H¨ugel, K¨onig & Liu [3, Example 6.1] (see also Remark 2.14 (ii)) show that the derived category
D = D(Rep K) of representations of the Kronecker quiver K admits a triangulated composition
series of inﬁnite length, where all but one composition factor are not derived module categories. It is
well-known that D also has a composition series of length 2 with factors derived categories of vector
spaces. Because of this observation and ‘a lack of techniques to study the general triangulated
categories appearing in triangulated composition series’, they decided to restrict to triangulated

composition series involving only derived module categories. We call these composition series
derived composition series and the corresponding simple factors derived simple. We can now state
the main questions of this article.

The ﬁrst question asks for an analogue of the Jordan-H¨older property.

Question 1.1 (Jordan-H¨older). When are derived composition series ﬁnite? When are the derived
composition factors unique up to reordering and equivalences?

Question 1.2. What does the existence of ‘special’ derived composition series tell us about the
original category?

In particular, Liu & Yang [51, Question 1.1] ask whether derived categories of quasi-hereditary
algebras may be characterised as those derived categories admitting a derived composition series
with all factors derived categories of vector spaces?

On Question 1.1. Question 1.1 is known to have a positive answer for piecewise hereditary
algebras [4], blocks of ﬁnite group algebras [50], Vossieck’s derived discrete algebras [57], ﬁnite
dimensional algebras with at most two simples [51], commutative algebras and semisimple algebras.
It is known that the answer is negative in general, for non-uniqueness see [20] (this involves
non-artinian rings) and [5] (for counterexamples involving algebras of inﬁnite global dimension).
Moreover, it is not too surprising that the length of a derived composition series need not be ﬁnite,
see e.g.
[3, Example 6.2]. Question 1.1 was open for quasi-hereditary algebras and due to the
existence of full exceptional sequences with good properties (given for example by the standard
modules) it seems that there was some hope for a positive answer in this case. Building on work
of Liu & Yang [51], we show that the derived category of the algebra A′

2 := kQ2/I ′

2 given by

α1

2

γ

β

α2

Q2 :=

I ′
2 := (α2β, γα1)

(1.2)

has at least two derived composition series of diﬀerent length. Since A′
2 has global dimension 2 it
is quasi-hereditary [25, Theorem 2]. Moreover, since A′
2 is gentle (see Deﬁnition 4.1) its derived
category is of tame representation type – indeed, in this case the repetitive algebra is special
biserial [59, 61]. Finally, all algebras appearing in our derived composition series have ﬁnite global
dimension and all involved recollements are induced by idempotents. In particular, compared to
the examples in [20] and [5], our examples have a quite diﬀerent ﬂavour.

We use this example as a starting point to construct quasi-hereditary algebras with an arbitrary

number of composition series of diﬀerent length (see Proposition 3.12).

Remark 1.3.

(i) It follows from work of Dlab & Ringel [26] that every ﬁnite dimensional algebra
B can be written as B = eAe where A is quasi-hereditary and e ∈ A is an idempotent. From
this perspective the failure of the derived JH-property does not seem to be too surprising –
indeed in our example all recollements are induced by idempotents.

(ii) From a ‘practical’ perspective the failure of the derived JH-property for quasi-hereditary
algebras is not a problem – it is well-known (see Lemma 2.19) that there always exists a

4

Martin Kalck

derived composition series with factors Db(k), which is convenient for inductively computing
invariants. Continuing this line of thought JH-properties would be most useful in situations
where there are no simple composition series known. In these situations, before computing
invariants, it might be good to know whether there are ‘simpler’ composition series and a
JH-property would tell us that we cannot do better.

On Question 1.2. We ﬁrst remark that it is well-known that triangulated composition series
with composition factors Db(k) correspond to full exceptional sequences and vice versa, see Lemma
2.15. For derived categories of ﬁnite dimensional algebras these composition series will in general
involve triangulated categories which are not derived module categories, see e.g. Example 2.23.
For derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras there is always a (special) derived composition
series with factors Db(k), see Corollary 2.19 – namely, all involved recollements are given by
primitive idempotents. Question 1.2 asks about a converse. Liu & Yang [51] showed that the
derived categories of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra with at most two simple modules admits a derived
composition series with factors Db(k) if and only if it is derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary
algebra. We show that this statement fails for algebras with more than two simples. More precisely,
the factor algebra

A2 := A′

2/(α1α2)

(1.3)

(see (1.2)) admits a derived composition series with factors Db(k) (Lemma 5.3), is not quasi-
hereditary (see Lemma 5.5) and is the unique algebra in its derived equivalence class (up to Morita
equivalence), see Corollary 4.7. The key step is to show the following proposition which has further
consequences and also relates to other work, see the remarks below.

Proposition 1.4. The algebra A2 deﬁned in (1.3) is not derived equivalent to A1 := kQ1/I1 where

Q1 :=

a
b

I1 := (a2, b2).

Remark 1.5. There seems to be no way of distinguishing the derived categories of A1 and A2 by
known derived invariants. Indeed, Euler forms are derived invariant by [31, Proposition, p. 101].
The matrices of the Euler forms of A1 and A2 in the bases given by the simple modules are

Moreover, Ladkani [49] shows that the dimensions of the Hochschild cohomology groups of gen-
tle algebras are completely determined by the corresponding derived invariants of Avella-Alaminos
& Geiß [6]. For both A1 and A2 this invariant can be computed to be [2, 4].
Remark 1.6. The three algebras A1, A2 and A′
2, which play a key role in this article form a complete
set of representatives of the derived equivalence classes for gentle algebras with three arrows and
four vertices, see Corollary 4.7.

We point out some consequences and related work.

(a) Proposition 1.4 is part of a conjecture by Bobi´nski & Malicki [11] (A1 = Λ′
0(1, 0) and A2 =
Λ0(2, 1) in their notation, see also the paragraph after Lemma 4.8). We also show that Proposition
1.4 allows to distinguish the derived categories of a whole family of ﬁnite dimensional algebras
conﬁrming further parts of this conjecture, see Corollaries 4.29 & 4.31. Recently, Amiot conﬁrmed
other cases for gentle algebras arising from a torus with one boundary component, see [2]. Upon
receiving a preliminary version of this article Grzegorz Bobi´nski kindly informed us that using
an extension of Amiot’s techniques, he is able to establish the conjecture in all cases, see [9].
Our alternative approach might nevertheless be useful to understand derived categories of gentle
algebras, see also Remark 4.30.
(b) It follows from Avella-Alaminos & Geiß’ combinatorially deﬁned derived invariants for gentle
algebras [6] and considerations on the Euler form, that the derived equivalence class of A1 contains
at most A2 (up to Morita-equivalence). In combination with Proposition 1.4 this implies that A1
and A2 are ‘derived unique’ algebras, i.e. algebras for which the notions of Morita and derived
equivalence coincide, see Deﬁnition 4.5 and Corollary 4.7 for details.
(c) The algebra A1 appears in several diﬀerent places in the literature. We already mentioned [11].
Moreover, Burban & Drozd show that A1 is derived equivalent to coherent sheaves over a certain
non-commutative irreducible nodal cubic curve [19] – Burban also conjectured Corollary 4.7 for A1.
The algebra A1 also appears in work of Seidel [64, Section 3] in relation with a Fukaya category of a
certain Lefschetz pencil and in work of Kuznetsov [47]2 on a geometric counterexample to the JH-
property for triangulated composition series, see Remark 2.14 (ii). Finally, Orlov [55, Section 3.1.]
points out that A1 corresponds to the Ising 3-point function and is related to a Landau-Ginzburg
model. Moreover, he shows that its derived category may be realized as a thick subcategory of a
strong exceptional collection of vector bundles on a three dimensional smooth projective variety3.

Structure. Section 2 contains well-known background material: on recollements (and their re-
lation to admissible subcategories), which can be arranged into triangulated composition series
leading to the classical notion of exceptional sequences (in particular, we consider the case of
derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras with the exceptional sequences of standard and co-
standard modules). We also provide examples showing that complete exceptional sequences need
not be full and that full exceptional sequences don’t give derived composition series in general.

We explain our constructions of quasi-hereditary algebras with derived composition series of
diﬀerent length in Section 3. This gives a negative answer to Question 1.1. The results of this
section are not needed in the rest of the text.

In Section 4, we use Proposition 1.4, which we prove in the ﬁnal Section 6, to describe the derived
equivalence classes of gentle algebras with three vertices and four arrows. This implies that the

algebra A2 is not derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary algebra, which leads to a negative answer
to Liu & Yang’s Question 1.2 in Section 5. In Section 4, we also show how to reduce the conjecture
of Bobi´nski & Malicki to ‘algebras with full relations’ and apply this reduction to obtain further
parts of this conjecture from Proposition 1.4. We include some background material on the work
of Avella-Alaminos & Geiß [6], which is a key ingredient both in our reduction argument and in
the proof of Proposition 1.4, see subsection ‘Derived equivalences and the AG-invariant’.

Notation. Throughout, let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. All modules are left modules. For
a k-algebra A, we denote the derived category of left A-modules D(A − Mod) by D(A) and the
bounded derived category of ﬁnitely generated left A-modules Db(A − mod) by Db(A). For a set of
objects S in a triangulated category T , we write the thick subcategory generated by S as thick(S).
We read elements in the path algebra kQ of a quiver Q from right to left.

2. Preliminaries: recollements, composition series and exceptional se-

quences

The following notion is classical, see e.g. [12].

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let T be a triangulated category. A full triangulated subcategory A ⊆ T is called
admissible if the natural inclusion admits both a left and a right adjoint functor. In particular, A
is thick, i.e. it is closed under taking direct summands, see e.g. [13, Proposition 1.6].

For a subset S of a triangulated category T , we deﬁne the right orthogonal subcategory S ⊥ :=
{T ∈ T | HomT (S, T [i]) = 0 for all S ∈ S and all i ∈ Z}, which is a triangulated subcategory of T .
The left orthogonal subcategory ⊥S is deﬁned dually.
Remark 2.2. For an admissible subcategory A the right orthogonal A⊥ is left admissible (i.e. the
natural inclusion has a left adjoint) but need not be right admissible in general, see e.g. [5, Example
3.4.]. Dually, ⊥A is right admissible but not left admissible in general. This is closely related to the
notion of semi-orthogonal decompositions, see for example [35, p.3, conventions on recollements].

For an admissible subcategory A, the corresponding quotient T → T /A has good properties

(see e.g. [7, Section 1.4.4] and also [54, Section 9]) leading to the notion of a recollement.

Proposition 2.3. Let A ⊆ T be admissible. Then the following statements hold.

(a) The canonical triangulated quotient functor j∗ : T → T /A admits both a left adjoint j! and

a right adjoint j∗. This gives rise to a recollement, i.e a sequence

i∗

j!

A

i∗=i!

/ T

j!=j∗

T /A

(2.1)

j∗

where i∗ is the canonical inclusion with left adjoint i∗ and right adjoint i!.

(b) Conversely, let j∗ : T → Q be a triangulated quotient functor (i.e. j∗ induces and equivalence

T / ker j∗ → Q) with left adjoint j! and right adjoint j∗. Then ker j∗ ⊆ T is admissible.

(c) The right adjoint j∗ induces a triangle equivalence j∗ : T /A → A⊥. Dually, the left ajoint j!

yields a triangle equivalence j! : T /A →⊥A. In particular, j∗ and j! are fully faithful.

Proof. Part (a) & (b) are [54, Proposition 9.1.18] and its dual. To see part (c), we note that the
composition γ of the inclusion A⊥ ⊆ T followed by the natural projection j∗ : T → T /A is an
[54, Proposition 9.1.16]. Using the adjunction (j∗, j∗) one can check that
equivalence, see e.g.
j∗ : T /A → A⊥ is well-deﬁned and right adjoint to the equivalence γ : A⊥ → T /A. Since right
adjoints are unique j∗ has to be a quasi-inverse to γ completing the proof.

Remark 2.4. Parts (a) & (b) show that recollements are completely determined by ﬁxing ‘one half’.

Remark 2.5. Consider a recollement as in (2.1). It is well-known (see e.g. [54, p. 319]) that every
object X of T ﬁts into two distinguished triangles

i!i!X → X → j∗j∗X → i!i!X[1] and j!j!X → X → i∗i∗X → j!j!X[1],

where the morphisms starting from and ending at X are the units and counits of the adjunctions.

Deﬁnition 2.6. An object E in a k-linear triangulated category is called exceptional, if

HomT (E, E[i]) = k.

Mi∈Z

By Proposition 2.3, the following well-known example yields a recollement starting from the left
hand side. This is used in Lemma 2.15 to construct recollements from exceptional sequences.

Example 2.7. Let T = Db(A) for a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra A of ﬁnite global dimension.
Let E in T be an exceptional object. Then the thick subcategory thick(E) ⊆ T generated by

L

E is admissible. Indeed the right adjoint is given by RHomA(E, −)
RHomA(−, E)∗

⊗k E and the left adjoint is
⊗k E, where (−)∗ = Homk(−, k) denotes the k-duality. More generally, one can

L

replace T by a k-linear algebraic triangulated category, such that dimkLi∈Z HomT (X, Y [i]) < ∞

for all X, Y in T .

In combination with Proposition 2.3, the following well-known proposition gives examples for

recollements starting from a ﬁxed right hand side.

Proposition 2.8. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra and e ∈ A be an idempotent such that
eAe has ﬁnite global dimension. Then there is a triple of adjoint triangle functors

Db(A)

j!=Ae

i.e. (j!, j!) and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs. Moreover, j∗ = j! is a triangulated quotient functor.

Ae⊗eAe−

eA⊗A−

/ eAe − mod

,

HomeAe(eA,−)

by the adjunction formula. Deriving this and using gl. dim eAe < ∞ yields the adjoint triple (2.2)
above. To show that j! is a quotient functor one can proceed as follows. Using the dual of [28,
Proposition III.5] in combination with [27, Theorem 8.4.4.] shows that HomA(Ae, −) induces is an
equivalence of abelian categories A − mod/(A/AeA) − mod → eAe − mod, see e.g. [52, Proposition
5.9]. In combination with [52, Theorem 3.2] this ﬁnishes the proof.

Remark 2.9. One can check that the kernel of j! is thick(A/AeA − mod). So combining Proposition
2.8 with Proposition 2.3 yields a recollement (thick(A/AeA − mod), Db(A), Db(eAe)).

Viewing recollements as analogues of short exact sequences for triangulated categories, leads to
the notions of triangulated simple categories and triangulated composition series, which we intro-
duce below. The main results of this article deal with the special case of derived simple categories
and derived composition series, see Deﬁnition 2.22. However, for examples from algebraic geometry
and some general statements (e.g. Lemma 2.15) it is convenient to introduce this terminology.

Deﬁnition 2.10. A triangulated category T is called triangulated simple if there is no non-trivial
recollement (T ′, T , T ′′).

Example 2.11.

(a) The bounded derived category of vector spaces Db(k) is triangulated sim-
Indeed more generally triangulated categories which do not admit non-trivial thick

ple.
subcategories are triangulated simple.

(b) Indecomposable Calabi-Yau categories C (e.g. derived categories of connected Calabi-Yau
varieties, cluster categories, singularity categories of isolated Gorenstein singularities) are
triangulated simple. Indeed assume that there exists a non-trivial recollement, i.e. an admis-
sible subcategory A ⊂ N . It follows from the triangles in Remark 2.5 that C is generated by
A and A⊥. Using the Calabi-Yau property, we see that A⊥ =⊥A and therefore C ∼= A ⊕ A⊥.

Deﬁnition 2.12. Let T be a triangulated category. A triangulated composition series of T is a
binary tree constructed by iteratively taking recollements. Starting with a recollement (T0, T , T1)
of T and continuing with recollements of T0 and T1 and so forth until triangulated simple categories
are reached.

We refer to Example 2.23, Lemma 2.15 and Section 3 for examples.

Exceptional sequences and derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras.

Deﬁnition 2.13. Let T be a k-linear triangulated category. A sequence (E1, . . . , En) of excep-
tional objects Ei is called exceptional sequence if

HomT (Ej , Ei[s]) = 0 for all

j > i and all

s ∈ Z.

It is called full if thick(E1, . . . , En) = T and complete (or maximal ) if there exists no exceptional
object E in T such that (E1, . . . , Ei−1, E, Ei, . . . , En) is an exceptional sequence, where 1 ≤ i ≤
n + 1.

Remark 2.14.

(i) It is well-known that full exceptional sequences are complete. We proceed by
induction. Let T = thick(E) for an exceptional object E. Then T ∼= Db(k) where E is
identiﬁed with k - in particular, any object in T is a direct sum of shifts of E. Therefore,
this exceptional sequence cannot be extended. Assume that the statement is already shown
for a full exceptional sequence of length at most n − 1. Let (E1, . . . , En) be a full exceptional
sequence and assume that there is an exceptional sequence (E1, . . . , Ei−1, E, Ei, . . . , En),
where 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1. This yields the following equalities of subcategories

thick(Ei, . . . , En) =⊥ thick(E1, . . . , Ei−1) = thick(E, Ei, . . . , En)

see e.g. [12, Lemma 6.1]. By deﬁnition, (Ei, . . . , En) is a full exceptional sequence in this sub-
category. By induction it is complete which contradicts the existence of the full exceptional
sequence (E, Ei, . . . , En). This ﬁnishes the proof.

(ii) The converse fails already for the derived category of the algebra A1 from Proposition 1.4,
which has global dimension 2 and hence is quasi-hereditary [25, Theorem 2] (we will see later
(Corollary 2.19) that this implies that Db(A) admits a full exceptional sequence). Bondal
(see e.g.
[47]) observed that the exceptional collection (E) of length 1 is complete, where
E = 1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3 is an exceptional A1-module. To see this one can check that the Euler forms
on ⊥E and E⊥ are anti-symmetric and therefore these categories don’t contain exceptional
objects. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘failure of Jordan-H¨older Theorem’ for semi-
orthogonal decompositions (or triangulated composition series in our language) and was
used by Kuznetsov [47] to construct new geometric counter-examples to the Jordan-H¨older
property.

For piecewise hereditary algebras (i.e. ﬁnite dimensional algebras which are derived equiva-
lent to abelian categories of global dimension 1) the notions of full and complete exceptional
sequences coincide, see e.g. [4] together with Lemma 2.15 and also [24] for the special case
of exceptional sequences of quiver representations.

It follows from Example 2.7 & Proposition 2.3 that full exceptional sequences give rise to
triangulated composition series with composition factors Db(k) and vice versa. This is summarized
in the following well-known lemma.

Lemma 2.15. Let T be a k-linear algebraic triangulated category, such that dimkLi∈Z HomT (X, Y [i]) <

∞ for all X, Y in T . Then every full exceptional sequences in T gives rise to a triangulated compo-
sition series with factors Db(k). Conversely, every such composition series yields a full exceptional
sequence.

Proof. Let (E1, . . . , En) be a full exceptional sequence. Example 2.7 shows that thick(E1) is an ad-
missible subcategory. Using Proposition 2.3 (a), we get a recollement (thick(E1), T , T / thick(E1)),
where T / thick(E1) ∼=⊥ E1 by Proposition 2.3 (c) and further ⊥E1 = thick(E2, . . . , En) by [12,
Lemma 6.1]. By induction, we get a composition series with factors thick(Ei) ∼= Db(k) (see Exam-
ple 2.11 (a)).

Martin Kalck

Conversely, assume that T has a composition series with factors Db(k).

In particular, we
obtain a recollement of the form (Db(k), T , T ′) or (T ′′, T , Db(k)). In both cases the image E of
k ∈ Db(k) in T is exceptional. Proposition 2.3 (c) shows that T ′ respectively T ′′ identify with E⊥
and ⊥E. By assumption these categories again admit recollements involving Db(k) as one of the
factors. Iterating this process yields an exceptional sequence. The standard triangles associated
with recollements (Remark 2.5) imply that this sequence is full.

We turn to an example which will be important in the sequel. Derived categories of quasi-
hereditary algebras admit full exceptional sequences, for example given by standard modules. We
start with the deﬁnition of a quasi-hereditary algebra due to Scott [63] (cf. [51]).

Deﬁnition 2.16. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra and let e ∈ A be an idempotent. The
two-sided ideal AeA is called heredity if eAe is a semi-simple algebra and AeA is projective as a
left A-module. The algebra A is called quasi-hereditary if there exists a chain of two-sided ideals

0 = J0 ⊆ J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Jm = A

(2.4)

such that Ji/Ji−1 is a heredity ideal in A/Ji−1 for all i = 1, . . . , m. In particular, semi-simple
algebras and all quotient algebras A/Ji are quasi-hereditary.

Remark 2.17.

(a) Let A be a quasi-hereditary algebra. One can reﬁne the chain (2.4) in such a

way that all heredity ideals Ji/Ji−1 are given by primitive idempotents.

(b) Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra and let e ∈ A be an idempotent. The canonical
functor ι : Db(A/AeA) → Db(A) is fully faithful, if AeA is a projective left A-module, see [21,
Theorem 3.1(1)]. In this situation, imι = thick(A/AeA − mod) is the kernel of the quotient
functor HomA(Ae, −) : Db(A) → Db(eAe). If eAe has ﬁnite global dimension, we obtain a
recollement (Db(A/AeA), Db(A), Db(eAe)) by Proposition 2.8.

Combining Remarks 2.17 (a) and (b) with Deﬁnition 2.16 shows the following well-known

lemma, see e.g. [22, Corollary 3.7].

Lemma 2.18. Let A be a quasi-hereditary algebra. Then the primitive idempotents e1, . . . , en ∈ A
may be ordered such that there are recollements (Db(A/A(e1 + . . . + ei+1)A), Db(A/A(e1 + . . . +
ei)A), Db(k)).

Corollary 2.19. Let T = Db(A) for a quasi-hereditary algebra A. Then there exists a triangulated
composition series with factors Db(k). In particular, this yields many full exceptional sequences by

⊗eAe − or
Lemma 2.15. Namely in each recollement we can either choose the embedding j! = Ae
j∗ = RHomeAe(eA, −). One can check that the sequence of standard modules arises from always
choosing j! and the sequences costandard modules arises from always chosing j∗.

L

In the situation of Lemma 2.18, all triangulated categories appearing in the triangulated com-
position series are derived modules categories. In a series of papers Angeleri H¨ugel, K¨onig, Liu
(and Yang) [3, 4, 5] studied triangulated composition series of this form. We introduce some
terminology for later use.

Deﬁnition 2.20. A ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra A is called derived simple if there exists no
non-trivial recollement (Db(A1), Db(A), Db(A2)) with ﬁnite dimensional k-algebras A1 and A2.

Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras and their derived composition series

11

Remark 2.21. Every triangulated simple algebra is derived simple.

Following [3, Section 5] we can now introduce the notion of composition series of derived module

categories – these can be thought of as analogues of composition series for modules over rings.

Deﬁnition 2.22. A composition series of the derived module category Db(A) of a ﬁnite dimensional
k-algebra A is a triangulated composition series (see Deﬁnition 2.12) such that all triangulated
categories appearing in the binary tree are equivalent to derived categories of ﬁnite dimensional
algebras. It is also called derived composition series of A.

The following example shows that full exceptional sequences need not give rise to derived
composition series. In fact the exceptional sequence studied here also leads to our counterexample
for the question of Liu & Yang, see Section 5.

Example 2.23. Let A = A2 be the algebra from Proposition 1.4 and consider the full excep-
tional sequence of A-modules (S2, P1, P3), which by Proposition 2.3 gives rise to a recollement
∼= thick(S2 ⊕ P1). One can check that there is an isomorphism of
(thick(P3), Db(A), P ⊥
graded algebras

3 ), and P ⊥

HomDb(A)(S2 ⊕ P1, (S2 ⊕ P1)[s]) ∼= k(cid:16) x

(2.5)

where one arrow is in degree 0 and the other arrow is in degree 2. By deﬁnition, the graded
algebra G is isomorphic to the cohomology of the dg endomorphism algebra End(S2 ⊕ P1), which
can be equipped with a minimal A∞-structure such that there is an A∞-quasi-isomorphism (see
[39] and also [42, Section 3.3.] and references in there)

End(S2 ⊕ P1) ∼= H ∗(End(S2 ⊕ P1)).

(2.6)

Since the quiver of H ∗(End(S2 ⊕ P1)) ∼= G is directed and has only two vertices this A∞-algebra
has no higher multiplications, see for example [42, Section 3.5]. This shows that there is a quasi-
isomorphism of dg algebras End(S2 ⊕ P1) ∼= G, where G is considered as a dg algebra with trivial
diﬀerential. In combination with Keller’s Morita theorem for triangulated categories (see e.g. [43,
Theorem 3.8 b)]) this yields triangle equivalences

thick(S2 ⊕ P1) ∼= per End(S2 ⊕ P1) ∼= per G.

(2.7)

One can show that per G is not triangle equivalent to the derived category of a k-algebra, see e.g.
[51, Corollary 3.3].

3. Quasi-hereditary algebras with non-unique derived composition series

The aim of this section is to construct a family of examples having diﬀerent derived composition se-
ries. More precisely, given any natural number n we construct a ﬁnite dimensional quasi-hereditary
algebra A such that D∗(A) has at least 2n derived composition series of pairwise diﬀerent length
and at least n diﬀerent derived simple factors occur. In particular, this gives a negative answer
to the uniqueness part of Question 1.1 for quasi-hereditary algebras. The results of this section
are not needed in the rest of the text. In this section, we write D∗(A) for the derived categories
D(A − Mod), D−(A − Mod), Db(A − Mod), Db(A − mod), K b(proj −A) of left A-modules.

Note that B1 = A′

2 is the algebra from the introduction (1.2). We show below that the algebras
Bl are quasi-hereditary of global dimension 2 and that they give a negative answer to Question
1.1. In other words, they do not satisfy the derived Jordan-H¨older property as studied by Angeleri-
H¨ugel, K¨onig & Liu [3].

Lemma 3.1. Let l ∈ Z≥1, set B = Bl and let e = e1 + e2 ∈ A.

(a) B is a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra.

(b) gl. dim B = 2.

(c) Exti

B(B/BeB, B/BeB) = Exti

B(S3 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Sl+2, S3 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Sl+2) = 0 for i > 0.

Proof.

(a) One can check that all paths of length greater than 4 are contained in Il.

(b, c) The projective resolutions of the simple Bl modules Si are given as follows:

0 → Pl+2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ P3 → P2 ⊕ P2 → P1 → S1 → 0
0 → Pl+2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ P3 → P2 → S2 → 0
0 → P2 → P1 → Pi+2 → Si+2 → 0

for i = 1, . . . , l.

This yields (b) and (c).

Corollary 3.2. Let l ∈ Z≥1 then Bl is a quasi-hereditary algebra.

Proof. This follows from Dlab & Ringel [25, Theorem 2] in combination with Lemma 3.1 (b).

with relations bci and cja. Moreover, these algebras are isomorphic to the generalized Fibonacci
algebra Gl := A3((1, 1), (l)) as studied by Liu & Yang [51] and it is shown in loc. cit. that the Gl
have global dimension 3.

Proposition 3.4. Let l ∈ Z≥1 then B = Bl has at least two non-equivalent derived composition
series.

(a) A derived composition series of length l + 2 with all composition factors given by D∗(k).

(b) A derived composition series of length l + 1 with l composition factors given by D∗(k) and

one composition factor given by D∗(Gl).

In particular, the derived JH property fails for these algebras.

Proof. The existence of (a) follows from the fact that Al is quasi-hereditary (Corollary 3.2) and
that quasi-hereditary algebras admit derived composition series with all factors of the form Db(k),
see Corollary 2.19.

Ql

In order to see the existence of (b), let e = e1 + e2. There is an algebra isomorphism B/BeB ∼=
i=1 k. By Lemma 3.3, eBe has ﬁnite global dimension and therefore Proposition 2.8 yields a rec-
ollement (thick(B/BeB − mod), Db(B), Db(eBe)), see e.g. Remark 2.9. Lemma 3.1 (c) shows that
the natural functor Db(B/BeB) → Db(B) induces an equivalence Db(B/BeB) ∼= thick(B/BeB −
mod). So we get a recollement (Db(B/BeB), Db(B), Db(eBe)). Since all involved algebras have
ﬁnite global dimension (see Lemma 3.1 (b)), we get recollements (D∗(B/BeB), D∗(B), D∗(eBe))
i=1 k and eBe ∼= Gl (see Lemma 3.3)

by [5]. Combining the algebra isomorphisms B/BeB ∼= Ql

with the fact that Gl is derived simple (see [51, Corollary 4.3]) completes the proof.

Remark 3.5. Dong Yang pointed out that Vossieck’s derived discrete algebras (of ﬁnite global
dimension) satisfy the derived JH property. Recently, this was also shown in a work of Yongyun
Qin for all derived discrete algebras, see [57]. The algebra B1 = A′
2 is gentle and therefore its
derived category has tame representation type. In this sense our example is as small as possible.

The idea which we used to modify the derived simple algebras Gk to obtain quasi-hereditary
algebras Ak seems to work for all derived simple two-vertex algebras of ﬁnite global dimension, see
Liu & Yang [51] for a list of these algebras. This leads to the following question.

Question 3.6. Let G be a ﬁnite dimensional derived simple algebra of ﬁnite global dimension.
Does there exists a quasi-hereditary algebra A such that D∗(G) occurs as a factor in a derived
composition series of D∗(A) ?

In the next paragraph, we ‘glue’ copies of the algebras Bl together using certain triangular
matrix algebras. The algebras constructed in this way are again quasi-hereditary. Extending
and building on Proposition 3.4, we show that they can have an arbitrary number of derived
composition series of diﬀerent length (Proposition 3.12).

Glueing. Let B′ = kQ′/I ′ and B′′ = kQ′′/I ′′ be ﬁnite dimensional algebras and let a ∈ Q′
b ∈ Q′′

a→b B′′ for the triangular matrix algebra

0 be vertices. We write B = B′

0 and

which may also be written as B = kQ/I, where Q is obtained from the disjoint union of Q′ and
Q′′ by adding an arrow a → b and I := I ′ + I ′′. This construction is associative: given quiver
algebras A = kQ/I, B = kR/J, C = kS/K and vertices a ∈ Q0, b, b′ ∈ R0 and c ∈ S0, we have

(A a→b B) b′→c C ∼= A a→b (B b′→c C) ,

which we write as A a→b B b′→c C in the sequel.

Consider the idempotent eB ′ =Pi∈Q′

0

ei ∈ B in (3.2). Then we have the following fact.

Lemma 3.7. There are algebra homomorphisms B′ ∼= eB ′ BeB ′ and B′′ ∼= B/BeB ′B. Moreover
B/BeB ′B is a projective B-module. In particular, Exti
B(B/BeB ′ B, B/BeB ′B) = 0 for all i > 0.

Corollary 3.8. Assume that B′ and B′′ have ﬁnite global dimension. Then there is a recollement
(D∗(B′′), D∗(B), D∗(B′)).

Proof. Using Lemma 3.7 the existence of a recollement (Db(B′′), Db(B), Db(B′)) follows as in the
proof of Proposition 3.4 (b). In particular, gl. dim B′, gl. dim B′′ < ∞ imply gl. dim B < ∞, cf. e.g.
[5, Theorem I]. Therefore we get all recollements (D∗(B′′), D∗(B), D∗(B′)), e.g. by [5].

We introduce the following notation:

Deﬁnition 3.9. Let l = (l1, . . . , lm) be a sequence of positive integers. Set

Bl := Bl1 2→1 Bl2 2→1 . . . 2→1 Blm ,

where the Bli are the algebras deﬁned in (3.1).

In order to see that the triangular matrix algebras Bl are again quasi-hereditary, we include

the following well-known lemma, see e.g. Zhu [69, Theorem 3.1.].

Lemma 3.11. Let B′ and B′′ be quasi-hereditary algebras with respect to linear orders 1′ < 2′ <

where ∆(i′) and ∆(j′′) denote the standard modules for B′ and B′′, respectively.

Proposition 3.12. Let l = (l1, . . . , lm) be a sequence positive integers. Then Bl is a quasi-
hereditary algebra with at least 2m derived composition series of pairwise diﬀerent length. The
derived composition factors are given by D∗(k), D∗(Gl1 ), . . . , D∗(Glm ).

Proof. A combination of Lemma 3.11, Corollary 3.2 and an inductive argument shows that Bl is
quasi-hereditary. Lemma 3.11 applies since the bimodules in our construction (3.2) are projective
left B′′-modules, which are ﬁltered by standard B′′-modules by deﬁnition of a quasi-hereditary al-
gebra. The statement about derived composition series follows from Proposition 3.4 in conjunction
with Corollary 3.8.

4. Derived equivalence classiﬁcation of certain gentle algebras

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let Q be a ﬁnite quiver with set of arrows Q1. A gentle algebra is a ﬁnite
dimensional k-algebra kQ/I such that:

(G1) At any vertex, there are at most two incoming and at most two outgoing arrows.

(G2) I is a two-sided admissible ideal, which is generated by paths of length two.

(G3) For each arrow β ∈ Q1, there is at most one arrow α ∈ Q1 such that 0 6= αβ ∈ I and at most

one arrow γ ∈ Q1 such that 0 6= βγ ∈ I.

(G4) For each arrow β ∈ Q1, there is at most one arrow α ∈ Q1 such that αβ /∈ I and at most

one arrow γ ∈ Q1 such that βγ /∈ I.

Remark 4.2. It is well-known that gentle algebras can also be characterised as those ﬁnite dimen-
sional algebras with special biserial repetitive algebras, see for example Schr¨oer [61, Section 4] and
also Ringel [59].

Proposition 4.3. The algebras A1 and A2 from Proposition 1.4 are the only gentle algebras of
ﬁnite global dimension with three vertices and four arrows such that the rank of the symmetrized
Euler form is 1.

Proof. We check this case by case. For this we give a list of all gentle algebras kQ/I of ﬁnite global
dimension with three vertices and four arrows - in particular, the quivers Q do not contain loops,
see e.g. [36]. Therefore, there have to be two vertices which are connected by at least two arrows.

Case 1: Kronecker. Assume that Q contains a subquiver of the form

(4.1)

Up to algebra isomorphism the algebra A1 from Proposition 1.4 above is the unique gentle
algebra with underlying quiver Q1. Moreover, A3 = kQ3/(ca, ab, dc) is (up to algebra isomorphism)
the unique gentle algebra with underlying quiver Q3 and dually Qop
3 (again unique
up to isomorphism). There are two gentle algebra structures (of ﬁnite global dimension) on Q2 up
to isomorphism (A2 and A′
2 from (1.2), which is the starting point for our examples in
Section 3). The rank of the symmetrized Euler form for all algebras (except for A1 and A2) arising
in this way is 2.

3 gives rise to Aop

2 := kQ2/I ′

Case 2: Two-cycle. Assume that Q contains a subquiver of the form

there is the following family of quivers

where the edges z1 and z2 can have an arbitrary orientation. One can check that the rank of

the symmetrized Euler-form is 2 for all of these algebras.

There is no way to deﬁne a ﬁnite dimensional gentle algebra of ﬁnite global dimension on the

following quiver:

1

( 2

( 3

Summing up, A1 and A2 are the only gentle algebras of ﬁnite global dimension with three

vertices and four arrows such that the rank of the symmetrized Euler form is 1.

Remark 4.4. One can compute that all gentle algebras of ﬁnite global dimension with three vertices
& four arrows have AG-invariant [2, 4]. This can also be deduced from [11, Lemma 3.1] as all these
gentle algebras are degenerate in the sense of [11], see e.g. the proof of Corollary 4.7.

Moreover, the AG-invariant is a complete derived invariant for gentle algebras with at most
two vertices. Indeed this follows from the classiﬁcation of Bessenrodt & Holm [8, Example 3.7]
in combination with Ladkani [49] and the deﬁnition of the AG-invariant, which detects oriented
cycles with full zero relations. In particular, Proposition 1.4 provides a minimal4 example showing
that the AG-invariant is not suﬃcient to distinguish derived categories of gentle algebras, see [11]
& [2] for further examples.

Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras and their derived composition series

17

Deﬁnition 4.5. We call a noetherian ring A derived unique 5 if every ring B which is derived
equivalent to A is already Morita equivalent to A. In other words, the derived equivalence class
and the Morita equivalence class of A coincide.

Remark 4.6.

(1) Examples of derived unique algebras include commutative algebras [60], local
algebras [70], path algebras of n-Kronecker quivers, preprojective algebras of Dynkin ([1])
and of extended Dynkin type ([38])...

(2) In algebraic geometry, Bondal & Orlov [14] showed that the derived category Db(coh X) of
a smooth projective variety X with ample canonical or anticanonical bundle determines X.
It would be interesting to look for analogous results for derived unique algebras.

We ﬁnish with a complete description of derived equivalence classes of gentle algebras of ﬁnite

global dimension with three vertices and four arrows, this also follows from Bobi´nski [9].

Corollary 4.7. There are three derived equivalence classes of gentle algebras of ﬁnite global di-
mension with three vertices and four arrows

{A1}, {A2}, { algebras derived equivalent to A′

2}.

In particular, the algebras A1 and A2 are derived unique.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that A1 & A2 are derived unique. Only this part is used in Section 5.

Let Db(Ai) ∼= Db(B) be a triangle equivalence, with i = 1 or 2. The main result of Schr¨oer
& Zimmermann [62] shows that B is Morita equivalent to a gentle algebra C = kQ/I. Since the
rank of the Grothendieck group is a derived invariant Q has three vertices. The number of arrows
is a derived invariant by work of Avella-Alaminos & Geiß [6]. So Q has four arrows. The rank of
the symmetrized Euler form (cf. [31, Proposition, p. 101]) and ﬁniteness of global dimension are
invariant under derived equivalences, therefore C ∼= A1 or A2 by Proposition 4.3. By Proposition
1.4, A1 and A2 are not derived equivalent. Summing up, A1 and A2 are derived unique.

In order to complete the description of the derived equivalence classes, it remains to show that
all gentle algebras of ﬁnite global dimension and with three vertices and four arrows are derived
equivalent to A′
2. This follows from Bobi´nski & Malicki [11, Theorem 2] once we show that all
these algebras are degenerate in their sense. This can either be checked by direct computation
using the list in Proposition 4.3 or one can proceed as follows. By deﬁnition a gentle two-cycle
algebra (all our algebras are of this form) is either degenerate or non-degenerate. Moreover, this
property is invariant under derived equivalences. Bobi´nski & Malicki [11, Theorem 1] give a list
of representatives of derived equivalence classes of non-degenerate gentle two-cycle algebras. One
can check that there is no representative which has three vertices and ﬁnite global dimension.
Finiteness of global dimension is invariant under derived equivalences. Since, by assumption, our
algebras are of ﬁnite global dimension, they cannot be derived equivalent to a non-degenerate
algebra and therefore are indeed degenerate. This completes the proof.

Derived equivalences and the AG-invariant. This subsection contains background material
on work of Avella-Alaminos & Geiß [6], who describe the structure of certain characteristic com-
ponents of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the derived category of a gentle algebra (of ﬁnite global
dimension), leading to the deﬁnition of a derived invariant (called AG-invariant).

5We thank Michael Wemyss for suggesting this terminology.

Martin Kalck

Building on this, we modify given derived equivalences such that they identify certain prescribed
objects (Lemma 4.22). In special cases, this yields derived equivalences between corner algebras, by
passing to triangulated quotient categories (Corollary 4.23). This is used to simplify a conjecture of
Bobi´nski & Malicki [11] in the next subsection (Corollary 4.29) and also in the proof of Proposition
1.4 in Section 6.

We start with a general lemma, which we apply to gentle algebras in Corollary 4.23.

Lemma 4.8. Let A and B be ﬁnite dimensional algebras such that there is a triangle equivalence
Φ : Db(A) → Db(B). Let Si be an exceptional simple A-module and assume that there exists a
simple B-module Sj and an autoequivalence Ψ of Db(B) such that Φ(Si) ∼= Ψ(Sj). Then there is
a triangle equivalence

Db((1 − ei)A(1 − ei)) ∼= Db((1 − ej)B(1 − ej))

(4.2)

where ei ∈ A and ej ∈ B are the idempotents corresponding to Si and Sj, respectively.

Proof. Our assumptions imply that the triangle equivalence Ψ−1 ◦ Φ : Db(A) → Db(B) sends Si
to Sj. This gives an induced equivalence between Verdier quotient categories Db(A)/ thick(Si) ∼=
Db(B)/ thick(Sj). The proof of Proposition 2.8 shows that the functor Db(A) → Db((1 − ei)A(1 −
ei)) induced by multiplication with (1 − ei) is a quotient functor. Its kernel is thick(A/A(1 − ei)A −
mod), which equals thick(Si) since Si is exceptional by assumption. In particular, Db(A)/ thick(Si) ∼=
Db((1 − ei)A(1 − ei)) and we have an analogous result for B since Sj ∼= Ψ−1(Φ(Si)) is exceptional.
This completes the argument.

Characteristic components. Let Λ = kQ/I be a gentle algebra of ﬁnite global dimension.

Deﬁnition 4.9. A characteristic component (CC) of Λ is a connected component C of the Auslander-
Reiten quiver of Db(Λ) such that

(i) C has a boundary, i.e. C contains an Auslander-Reiten triangle τ X → Y → X → νX such

that Y is indecomposable.

(ii) indecomposable objects in C are mapped to string modules over the repetitive algebra bΛ
under Happel’s equivalence Db(Λ) ∼=bΛ − mod [31].

Building on [29] and [18], characteristic components are classiﬁed in [6].

Proposition 4.10. The following translation quivers occur as characteristic components

(i) ZAn for some n ∈ Z≥1.

(ii) ZA∞.

(iii) ZA∞/τ r for some r ∈ Z≥1.

Conversely, every AR-component C 6= ZA∞/τ of Db(Λ) which appears in (i) - (iii) is a CC.

In particular, derived autoequivalences act transitively on the boundary of a CC.

Corollary 4.11. If X and Y are objects in the boundary of a CC C of Λ, then there exists a
derived autoequivalence ψ of Db(Λ) such that ψ(X) ∼= Y .

Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras and their derived composition series

19

Proof. If C is of type ZA∞ or ZA∞/τ r, then there is a unique boundary component. By deﬁnition
the AR-translation τ acts transitively on it. Therefore, we can take ψ = τ t for some t ∈ Z.

If C is of type ZAn, then there are two boundary components. The AR-translation acts tran-
sitively on each of these components and the shift functor [1] identiﬁes the two components. So
either ψ = τ t[1] or ψ = τ t for some t ∈ Z will identify X and Y in this case.

We call a CC C homogeneous if C = ZA∞/τ and non-homogeneous otherwise.

Corollary 4.12. Let Λ, Λ′ be gentle algebras of ﬁnite global dimension. If ψ : Db(Λ) → Db(Λ′) is
a derived equivalence and C is a non-homogeneous CC of Λ, then ψ(C) is a non-homogeneous CC
of Λ′. Moreover, ψ maps objects in the boundary of C to the boundary of ψ(C).

Proof. Since ψ is a triangle equivalence it commutes with Serre-functors ν and shift functors [1]. In
particular, it commutes with the AR-translations τ = ν ◦ [−1]. Therefore, ψ maps AR-components
to AR-components and boundary objects to boundary objects. Finally, by assumption C 6= ZA∞/τ
appears in (i) - (iii) of Proposition 4.10, thus ψ(C) 6= ZA∞/τ occurs in this list as well. So ψ(C) is
a CC by Proposition 4.10.

Remark 4.13. In general, derived autoequivalences can identify homogeneous CCs with non-
characteristic components. For example, this happens for the Kronecker quiver.

The AG-invariant. One can check6 that the shift functor (on the stable category of the repetitive
algebra this is given by the inverse syzygy functor) acts on characteristic components. Avella-
Alaminos & Geiß [6] describe the orbits under this action: there are ﬁnitely many orbits and the
corresponding triangulated subcategories are fractionally Calabi-Yau. More precisely, there is an
algorithm [6, Section 3] with output a formal sum of pairs of integers ni, mi ∈ Z≥0

φΛ = [n1, m1] + . . . + [nt, mt]

(4.3)

obtained from counting certain walks in the gentle quiver with relations deﬁning Λ7. The next
result gives a categorical interpretation of this combinatorial information, see [6, Theorem 16].

Proposition 4.14. The summands [ni, mi] of φΛ are in bijection with the [1]-orbits of the CCs of
Λ. Moreover, every object X in a component of the orbit corresponding to [ni, mi] satisﬁes

νni X ∼= X[mi]

(4.4)

where ν denotes the Nakayama=Serre functor of Db(Λ). In other words, X is mi
ni

-fractionally CY.

Corollary 4.15. If there exists a homogeneous CC of Λ, then [1, 1] is a summand of φΛ.
Proof. Since τ = ν ◦ [−1] and by deﬁnition τ X ∼= X for objects X in homogeneous CCs, the
statement follows from Proposition 4.14.

Using this interpretation of φΛ, Avella-Alaminos & Geiß obtain their main result [6, Theorem A].

Theorem 4.16. Let A and B be derived equivalent gentle algebras, then φA = φB.

Therefore, we call φΛ the AG-invariant of Λ.

6By Corollary 4.12, it remains to check the homogeneous CCs.
7Repetitions [ni, mi] = [nj , mj ] for i 6= j may occur. This notation diﬀers from the one used in [6] but contains

the same information.

Boundaries of CCs, permitted threads and modiﬁcations of derived equivalences. The
objects in the boundary of CCs are classiﬁed, see e.g. [6, Section 2.3]. For our purposes it is enough
to understand which Λ-modules are in the boundary. We need the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4.17. Let A = kQ/I be a gentle algebra. A non-trivial permitted thread of A is a
maximal path p in (Q, I), i.e. p is not contained in I but any path in Q with subpath p is contained
in I. A trivial permitted thread is a trivial path 1v where v is a vertex in Q such that

(a) there is at most one arrow α ending in v.

(b) there is at most one arrow β starting in v.

(c) if both arrows α and β in (a) and (b) exist, then βα /∈ I.

A permitted thread is a trivial or non-trivial permitted thread.

Building on [18, 65], Avella-Alaminos & Geiß [6] show the following result, cf. also [29].

Proposition 4.18. Let p be a permitted thread of Λ. Then the corresponding string module M (p)
is contained in the boundary of a CC of Λ.

For simplicity, in the rest of this subsection, we restrict ourselves to the case where the AG-
invariant has only one summand. More generally, one could work with an orbit of CCs which
corresponds to a summand [ni, mi] such that [ni, mi] 6= [nj, mj] for all j 6= i.

Setup 4.19. Let A and B be derived equivalent gentle algebras such that φB = [n, m].

Remark 4.20. It follows that B = kQ/I (and therefore also A) has ﬁnite global dimension.

Indeed if gl. dim B = ∞ then there is a cyclic path with full relations in (Q, I), see e.g.

[40].
By [6, Remark 6], this shows that φB has a summand of the form [0, l(c)], where l(c) is the length
of c. By our assumption this would imply φB = [0, l(c)], but the algorithm producing φB shows
that there is always at least one summand [ni, mi] with ni 6= 0. Contradiction. So B has ﬁnite

global dimension. In particular, Happel’s equivalence Db(B) ∼= bB − mod holds and we can use all

the statements listed before Setup 4.19.

Lemma 4.21. In the notation of Setup 4.19, we have n 6= m.

Proof. Assume that φB = [n, n]. It follows from [10, Lemma 3.2] that the underlying quiver Q
of B has n vertices and n arrows. Since Q is connected (indeed otherwise φB has at least two
summands), the unoriented graph underlying Q is a cycle of length n. It follows from [6, Section
7] that φB has exactly two summands. Contradiction. So we see that indeed n 6= m.

In the situation of Setup 4.19, the derived equivalence can be adapted such that it identiﬁes
given objects X ∈ Db(A), Y ∈ Db(B) contained in boundaries of CCs (cf. also [9, Corollary 1.4]).

Lemma 4.22. In the notation of Setup 4.19, let p and q be permitted threads of A and B respec-
tively. Then there exists a derived equivalence ψ : Db(A) → Db(B) such that ψ(M (p)) ∼= M (q).

Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras and their derived composition series

21

Proof. Let γ : Db(A) → Db(B) be the given derived equivalence. Lemma 4.21 and Corollary 4.15
imply that all CCs of A and B are non-homogeneous. In combination with Proposition 4.18 this
shows that M (p) is contained in the boundary of a non-homogeneous CC of A. So γ(M (p)) is
contained in the boundary of a CC of B by Corollary 4.12. Since φB = [n, m] has a single summand,
there is a unique orbit of CCs of B under the shift functor by Proposition 4.14. In particular there
exists an integer s such that γ(M (p))[s] and M (q) are contained in the same (non-homogeneous)
CC of B. Corollary 4.11 yields an autoequivalence α of Db(B) such that αγ(M (p))[s] ∼= M (q).
Thus ψ := α ◦ γ ◦ [s] is an autoequivalence with the desired properties.

Combining Lemmas 4.22 and 4.8 yields the following corollary, which is used in Proposition 4.28.

Corollary 4.23. In the notation of Lemma 4.22, assume that p = 1v and q = 1w are trivial
permitted threads such that the corresponding simple string modules M (p) = Sv and M (q) = Sw
are exceptional.

Then there exists a derived equivalence Db((1 − ev)A(1 − ev)) ∼= Db((1 − ew)B(1 − ew)), where

ev and ew are the idempotents corresponding to the vertices v and w.

The next result plays a key role in our proof of Proposition 1.4, see Section 6.

Corollary 4.24. In the notation of Lemma 4.22, let q be a permitted thread such that M (q) is a
projective B-module. Then there exists a tilting object T in Db(A) which contains M (p) as a direct
summand and satisﬁes EndA(T ) ∼= Bop.
Proof. Lemma 4.22 shows that there is a derived equivalence ψ : Db(A) → Db(B) such that
ψ(M (p)) ∼= M (q). Rickard’s derived Morita theory [58] shows that there is a tilting object
T ∈ Db(A) such that EndA(T ) ∼= Bop and ψ(T ) ∼= B. Since M (q) is projective it is a direct
summand of B. Therefore ψ−1(M (q)) ∼= M (p) is a direct summand of T completing the proof.

deﬁnes algebras B(p, r) := kOp/Ip(r) for p ∈ Z≥0 and r ∈ [0, p].

Remark 4.25.

(a) In [11], the algebras A(p) are denoted by Λ′

0(p, 0) for p ≥ 1 and the B(p, r)

are denoted by Λ0(p + 1, r) for p ≥ 0.

(b) The algebras from Proposition 1.4 appear as special cases. Namely, A1 = A(1) and A2 =

B(1, 1). Moreover, A′

2 = B(1, 0) is the algebra deﬁned in (1.2).

The following conjecture of Bobi´nski & Malicki [11, Conjecture 1] states that diﬀerent algebras
from the families A(p) and B(p, r) are not derived equivalent. This was recently proved by Bobi´nski
[9] building on earlier work of Amiot [2].

Conjecture 4.26 (Bobi´nski & Malicki).
(a) Db(B(p, r)) ≇ Db(A(p′)) for all p ∈ Z≥0, p′ ∈ Z≥1, r ∈ [0, p].
(b) Db(B(p, r)) ∼= Db(B(p′, r′)) implies p = p′ and r = r′.

Remark 4.27. Since the rank of the Grothendieck group is a derived invariant, it follows that
Db(B(p, r)) ∼= Db(B(p′, r′)) implies p = p′ in part (b) of the conjecture. By the same argument
(a) holds if p 6= p′.

Bobi´nski & Malicki [11, paragraph after Conjecture 1] check that part (a) holds for r ≡ 0 (mod 2)
and also Db(B(p, r)) ∼= Db(B(p′, r′)) implies r ≡ r′ (mod 2). Indeed the symmetrized Euler form
of A(p) has rank p, whereas the rank of the symmetrized Euler form of B(p, r) is p + 1 if r is even
and p if r is odd.

The next result will be used in Corollary 4.29 to show that one of the algebras in the conjecture
can be assumed to be B(p, p). Bobi´nski [9, Corollary 2.2] shows the converse statements of this
proposition and combines them with Amiot’s results [2] to prove Conjecture 4.26 in full generality.

Proposition 4.28. Let p ∈ Z≥1 and r, r′ ∈ [0, p].

(i) If B(p, r) and B(p, r′) are not derived equivalent, then B(p + 1, r) and B(p + 1, r′) are not

derived equivalent.

(ii) If B(p, r) is not derived equivalent to A(p), then B(p + 1, r) and A(p + 1) are not derived

equivalent.

Proof. We can apply Corollary 4.23 to the simple modules S2 in Db(B(p + 1, r)) respectively S3 in
Db(A(p + 1)) to show the contraposition of (i) and (ii), respectively.

Indeed one can check that both simple modules are exceptional and deﬁned by trivial permitted
threads. Moreover, it follows by direct calculation or using [11, Lemma 3.1] that the AG-invariants
of B(p + 1, r) for all r and A(p + 1) are [p + 2, p + 4]. Since (1 − e2)B(p + 1, r)(1 − e2) ∼= B(p, r)
for all r < p + 1 and (1 − e3)A(p + 1)(1 − e3) ∼= A(p), Corollary 4.23 proves the contraposition of
(i) respectively (ii).

Using Proposition 4.28 iteratively, we can now reduce the conjecture as follows.

Corollary 4.29. It is enough to check the following cases of Conjecture 4.26:

(i) B(p, p) and B(p, r) are not derived equivalent for all p ≥ 0 and r < p.

(ii) B(p, p) and A(p) are not derived equivalent for all p ≥ 1.

Remark 4.30. It seems that the approach used in the proof of Proposition 1.4 could be extended
to deal with (some of) the cases of Conjecture 4.26 remaining after the reduction of Corollary 4.29,
we refer to Remark 6.1 for more details.

Combining Proposition 1.4 with Proposition 4.28 (ii), we obtain:

Corollary 4.31. Db(B(p, 1)) ≇ Db(A(p)) for all p > 0.

5. Exceptional sequences and quasi-hereditary algebras

– a negative answer to a question of Liu & Yang

The aim of this section is to give a negative answer to Question 1.2 of Liu & Yang (cf.
[51,
Question 1.1]), which we restate below for the convenience of the reader. We refer to Section 2 for
unexplained terminology.

Question 5.1. Let k be a ﬁeld and let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra. Assume that the derived
category of ﬁnitely generated left A-modules Db(A − mod) admits a composition series with simple
factors being ﬁnite-dimensional division k-algebras. Is A derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary
algebra?
Remark 5.2. Liu & Yang actually state the question with Db(A − mod) replaced by the unbounded
derived category of all A-modules D(A − Mod). However, it follows from [3] and [5] that any
Db(A − mod) composition series lifts to a D(A − Mod)-composition series. In particular, a negative
answer to Question 5.1 yields a negative answer to [51, Question 1.1].
Lemma 5.3. The algebra A2 admits a composition series by derived categories Db(k).
Proof. The simple A := A2-module S2 has the following projective resolution 0 → P1 → P3 → P2.
In particular, S2 ∼= A/AeA is an exceptional A-module, where e = e1 + e3. This shows that the
canonical functor Db(k) = Db(A/AeA) → Db(A) is fully faithful and its image is thick(A/AeA −
mod). Therefore, there is a recollement (Db(k), Db(A), Db(eAe)) by Remark 2.9. But eAe ∼= kQ,
where Q is the Kronecker quiver, which admits a recollement (Db(k), Db(kQ), Db(k)) induced by the
exceptional sequence given by the simple kQ-modules (Lemma 2.15). This ﬁnishes the proof.

Remark 5.4. We note that all categories involved in the ﬁrst recollement (Db(k), Db(A), Db(eAe))
in the proof of Lemma 5.3 have Serre functors. It is well-known that this can be used to obtain
a recollement (Db(eAe), Db(A), Db(k)) in the opposite direction, see e.g.
[5, Proposition 3.7].
However, combining the proof of Lemma 5.5 with Corollary 4.7 this recollement is not equivalent
to a recollement of the form (Db(B/BeB), Db(B), Db(eBe)) where B is a ﬁnite dimensional algebra
and e ∈ B is a primitive idempotent. Parshall & Scott [56, Section 5] show that this is the reason
why Db(A2) is not the derived category of a quasi-hereditary algebra.

Lemma 5.5. The algebra A2 does not admit a quasi-hereditary structure.

Proof. We show that A := A2 does not admit a heredity ideal AeA, where e = ei ∈ A is a primitive
idempotent. Therefore, A is not quasi-hereditary by Remark 2.17 (a). Namely, by Remark 2.17 (b),
the existence of such an ideal would imply that the canonical functor Db(A/AeA) ֒→ Db(A) is fully
faithful. But this is impossible since there are relations in A between any pair of vertices, yielding
non-trivial Ext2
A/AeA(−, −) = 0
for any primitive idempotent e ∈ A. Therefore, the canonical functor cannot be full.

Summing up, we obtain a negative answer to Liu & Yang’s Question 5.1.

Proposition 5.6. The derived category Db(A2) of the gentle algebra A2 admits a composition
series by derived categories Db(k) but A2 is not derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary algebra.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement is Lemma 5.3. The second statement is a combination of Lemma 5.5
and Corollary 4.7.

Remark 5.7. For ﬁnite dimensional quiver algebras A with two vertices Liu & Yang show that
Question 5.1 has a positive answer. In other words if Db(A) admits a composition series by derived
categories Db(k), then A is derived equivalent to a quasi-hereditary algebra. In that sense A2 is a
minimal counterexample to the question. Note that A1 admits a quasi-hereditary structure since
Q1 is directed. Since quasi-hereditary structures are not stable under derived equivalence (see Dlab
& Ringel’s [25, Example p. 283]) this cannot be used to distinguish the derived categories of A1 &
A2 directly. This motivates the following question.

Question 5.8. Is it possible to characterise derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras among
algebraic triangulated categories?

We refer to [56, Section 5] for a ﬁrst answer to this question – unfortunately, we are not able

to use this characterisation to obtain an alternative proof of Proposition 1.4.

6. Proof of Proposition 1.4

Outline of the proof. We give a proof by contradiction consisting of the following two steps:

(i) Assume that there exists a triangle equivalence Φ : Db(A1) ∼= Db(A2).

Rickard’s derived Morita theory [58] shows that there exists a tilting object T ∈ Db(A1) such
that there are isomorphisms of graded algebras

HomDb(A1)(T, T [i]) ∼= HomDb(A1)(T, T ) ∼= Aop

is concentrated in degree 0. Moreover, Φ(T ) ∼= A2 in Db(A2) and we can assume

where Aop

that T ∼= T1 ⊕ T2 ⊕ T3 with Ti ∈ Db(A1) indecomposable.
We show that T1 can be chosen to be the string module 1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3 and Φ(T1) ∼= P2.

(ii) Let T1 be as in (i). Using the repetitive algebra of A1, we show that there is no indecompos-

able object T ′ in Db(A1) such that

Li∈Z HomDb(A1)(T1 ⊕ T ′, (T1 ⊕ T ′)[i]) ∼= EndDb(A1)(T1 ⊕ T ′)
∼= k(cid:16) T1

This shows that (6.1) is impossible. Indeed Φ is an equivalence with Φ(T ) ∼= A2 and Φ(T1) ∼=
P2. Therefore, assuming (6.1), we have a chain of (graded) equivalences

Mi∈Z

HomDb(A1)(T1 ⊕ Tj, (T1 ⊕ Tj)[i]) ∼= EndDb(A1)(T1 ⊕ Tj)

Therefore, there cannot exist a derived equivalence Φ.

Step (i). This follows from Corollary 4.24. Indeed A2 has AG-invariant [2, 4] and P2 = 2
β
−→ 1 is an indecomposable projective A2-module deﬁned by a non-trivial permitted thread in the
3
sense of Deﬁnition 4.17. Since the A1-module 1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3 is also deﬁned by a non-trivial permitted
thread, Corollary 4.24 shows the claim.

Remark 6.1. This step can be generalised to other algebras appearing in Corollary 4.29.

Indeed, the indecomposable projective B(p, p)-modules P2, . . . , Pp+1 are strings given by per-

mitted threads satisfying

ν(Pp+1) = Pp, ν(Pp) = Pp−1, . . . , ν(P3) = P2.

(6.3)

Generalising Corollary 4.24, one can show that a tilting object yielding a derived equivalence
with B(p, p) has to contain a corresponding sequence of direct summands T2, . . . , Tp+1 deﬁned by
permitted threads.

It would be interesting to show an analogue of step (ii). Namely, that there is no indecomposable

exceptional object T ′ such that there are isomorphisms of graded algebras

Li∈Z Hom(T ′ ⊕ T2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Tp+1, (T ′ ⊕ T2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Tp+1)[i]) ∼=

End(T ′ ⊕ T2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Tp+1) ∼= EndB(p,p)(P ′ ⊕ P2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Pp+1) ∼= kCp+1/J 2,

where Cp+1 denotes a quiver consisting of a single oriented (p+1)-cycle, J ⊆ kCp+1 is the two-sided
ideal generated by the arrows and P ′ is isomorphic to P1 or Pp+2.

Step (ii). We use Happel’s triangle equivalence H : Db(A) ∼= bA − mod for ﬁnite dimensional
modules over the repetitive algebra cA1. We refer to [18, 23, 62, 65] for more details on string
module combinatorics. We begin by describing the repetitive algebra cA1 following Ringel [59] and

Schr¨oer [61]. Let

(a) We can choose our notation in such a way that H(1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3) ∼= 1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3.

(b) The shift in the triangulated category bA − mod is given by the inverse syzygy functor Ω−1.

(c) Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra and n ∈ Z≥1 then there are isomorphisms

Hom bA(Ωn(M ), N ) ∼= Extn

bA(M, N ) ∼= Hom bA(M, Ω−n(N )),

(6.7)

where M, N ∈ bA − mod. This is well-known. One can use [34, Exercises IV.7.2 & IV.8.3]
together with the fact that projective and injective bA-modules coincide.

(d) Assume that there exists an indecomposable object T ′ satisfying (6.2). In combination with

(b) and (c), we see that

(f) Using Happel’s equivalence H, (6.2) translates to the following statement. The stable endo-

(T1⊕T ′) of T1⊕T ′ is isomorphic to C = k( T1

morphism algebra End cA1
We show that this leads to a contradiction, see the last paragraph ‘Final step: splitting the
string T1’ below. By part (e), every stable morphism from T1 to T ′ is a linear combination
of equivalence classes of (weakly) one-sided graph maps, which are given by a factorstring
Ef in T1 and a corresponding substring Ef in T ′. In turn, stable morphisms from T ′ to T1
are generated by equivalence classes of maps given by substrings Es in T1 and corresponding
(T1, T ′) and
factorstrings Es in T ′. There are (weakly) one sided graph maps x ∈ Hom cA1
(T ′, T1). Combining this
(T1, T ′) and y ∈ Hom cA1
y ∈ Hom cA1
with the form of T1 = 1 → 2 → 3 shows that T ′ cannot be simple.

It follows from [62, Lemma 3.3] that xy = 0 if and only if xy = 0 and yx = 0 if and only
if yx = 0 (the Lemma is applicable since neither T1 nor T ′ is simple, see Zimmermann’s
correction [71] based on Zhou’s thesis [68, preliminary chapter]). Therefore, the substring Es
and the factorstring Ef must not overlap inside T1 and T ′, respectively (otherwise xy or yx
would be non-zero). This is illustrated in the picture above.

The following construction is well-known, see e.g. [62, Lemma 3.5]. It is used in the ﬁnal step
below to show that every candidate for the string module T ′ has non-trivial self-extensions,
contradicting (6.8).

provided M1 and M2 are well-deﬁned strings. This sequence does not split provided at least
one of Ul and Fl is non-empty and at least one of Ur and Fl is non-empty.

Final step: splitting the string T1. Assume that there exists T ′ satisfying (6.2). Then
the preliminary step (f) above, shows that there is a pair (Es, Ef ) consisting of a substring
Es and a factorstring Ef in T1 which do not overlap. Moreover, Es appears as a factorstring
and Ef as a substring in T ′ – again there is no overlap.

Claim: it is suﬃcient to show that the choice Ef = 1 leads to a contradiction.

Indeed since Ef and Es must not overlap in T1 = 1 → 2 → 3 there are exactly three choices
for the pair (Ef , Es): namely (1, 2 → 3), (1, 3) and (1 → 2, 3). But the last case is dual to
the ﬁrst. This proves the claim.

Let the one-sided morphism x from T1 to T ′ be given by the factor string Ef = 1 of T1 =
1 a−→ 2 b−→ 3. We will show that we can assume that T ′ has the following form (with Ef = 1
appearing as a substring on the left):

(T1, T ′). Moreover, the string deﬁning T ′ has to reach vertex 3 at some point (other-

would factor over the indecomposable projective cA1-module P0 (see (6.6)), so x = 0 ∈

Hom cA1
wise we don’t get a non-zero morphism to T1). This forces S to have the following shape

a

b

a

2

2

(indeed otherwise we can never reach a vertex smaller than 2 since the longest paths without

relations in (cQ1,bI) have length 2).

We apply Lemma 6.2 to obtain a non-trivial self-extension of the string T ′ contradicting
(6.8). In order to do this, we write T ′ in two diﬀerent ways:

S1 := T ′ =

0

S2 := T ′ =

exist, Lemma 6.2 shows Ext1
cA1
It remains to show that we can assume that T ′ starts as indicated in the picture (S0) above.
Since we want 1 to be a substring there are the following two other possibilities – where S1
and S2 have to be non-trivial (indeed, otherwise there is no non-zero morphism T ′ → T1).

(T ′, T ′) 6= 0 as desired.

If T ′ starts as in (S1), we apply the syzygy functor Ω to T1 ⊕ T ′. Using (6.6), we compute

Ω(T1) = 2 a−→ 3 b−→ 4

Derived categories of quasi-hereditary algebras and their derived composition series

31

and

Ω(T ′) =

2

a

1

b

2

S′
1

This is a shifted version of (S0) and we have already seen that this leads to a contradiction.
Since Ω is an autoequivalence, we deduce that T ′ cannot be of the form (S1).
In case T ′ starts as in (S2), we can repeatedly apply the Auslander-Reiten translation τ

(viewed as an autoequivalence of cA1 − mod) to both T ′ and T1. Since cA1 is special biserial

[59, 61], the action of τ on strings is well understood (see e.g. [65, Thm 4.1]).

τ n(T1) =((1 − n) a−→ (2 − n) b−→ (3 − n)

(1 − n) b−→ (2 − n) a−→ (3 − n)

if n is even;

if n is odd.

If we apply τ to T ′, we ‘remove a hook’ from the left of the string T ′:

m − 2

m − 2

S2

τ (−)

S′
2

m − 2

m − 1

m − 1

m − 1

m

where S′
2 is non-zero (indeed otherwise there is no non-zero morphism τ (T ′) → τ (T1)). After
repeatedly applying τ , we have removed all these hooks from T ′ and reach a (shifted) version
of (S0) or (S1) (indeed otherwise T ′ would have the following form

−3

−2

−2

−1

−1

−1

0

1

and again there would be no non-zero map from T ′ to T1. Contradiction), which (as before)
leads to a contradiction. This completes the proof.
