ABSTRACT
We have identiﬁed 274 M-type Brown Dwarfs in the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera
3 (WFC3) pure parallel ﬁelds from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey for high
redshift galaxies. These are near-infrared observations with multiple lines-of-sight out of our Milky
Way. Using these observed M-type Brown Dwarfs we ﬁtted a Galactic disk and halo model with a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. This model worked best with the scale length of the
disk ﬁxed at h = 2.6 kpc. For the scale height of the disk, we found z0 = 0.29+0.02−0.019 kpc and for the
central number density ρ0 = 0.29+0.20−0.13 #/pc3. For the halo we derived a ﬂattening parameter κ =
0.45±0.04 and a power-law index p = 2.4±0.07. We found the fraction of M-type brown dwarfs in
the local density that belong to the halo to be fh = 0.0075+0.0025
−0.0019. We found no correlation between
subtype of M-dwarf and any model parameters. The total number of M-type Brown Dwarfs in the
disk and halo was determined to be 58.2+9.81−6.70 × 109. We found an upper limit for the fraction of
M-type Brown Dwarfs in the halo of 7+5−4%. The upper limit for the total Galactic Disk mass in
M-dwarfs is 4.34+0.73−0.5 × 109 M(cid:12), assuming all M-type Brown Dwarfs have a mass of 80MJ .

1 INTRODUCTION

Counting stars in our Galaxy has long been used to infer its
structure. This is mostly done with relatively luminous stars
due to insuﬃcient data on substellar objects. Early work has
been done by Kapteyn (1922), Seares et al. (1925) and Oort
(1938) who used this method to determine the geometrical
structure of the Galaxy.

In this paper, the focus lies on the M-type brown
dwarfs (hereafter M-dwarfs). Brown dwarfs are very dim
(sub)stellar objects with masses that range from 13MJ to
80MJ . They are not able to fuse hydrogen and thus are not
considered stars. Instead, they burn deuterium and lithium.
The lower limit of burning deuterium is 13MJ and that of
lithium burning is around 60MJ . Brown dwarfs have a lim-
ited amount of nuclear energy because of the exothermic
reactions of deuterium and lithium, making them cool over
time. M-dwarfs are the hottest of their kind followed by L-,
T-, and Y-dwarfs (LeBlanc 2010). These types are divided
in subtypes where 0 indicates the hottest and 9 the coolest

of a particular type. M0 objects are not classiﬁed as brown
dwarfs, but as low-mass stars. However, because they are
dim low mass objects with an M-type colors, we will in-
clude them in this paper. Brown dwarfs are believed to be
among the most numerous luminous objects in our Milky
Way. Studying them can thus tell us a lot about the struc-
ture of the Milky Way.

Brown dwarfs resemble high redshift galaxies in both
colour and angular size. For example, redshift z ∼ 7 galax-
ies have very similar broad-band colors as L-dwarfs and both
are unresolved in most ground-based images. Most of the
time, we are still able to distinguish between them because of
their diﬀerent sizes in HST imaging (stars remain unresolved
with F W HM < 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1). High redshift galaxies usually appear
fuzzier than brown dwarfs making their FWHM larger. This
is not the case with wide-ﬁeld imaging from the ground, z >
5 galaxies are then unresolved at the seeing limit (Stanway
et al. 2008). At faint magnitudes, it becomes hard to resolve
galaxies in order to separate them from brown dwarfs using
high angular-resolution imaging (Tilvi et al. 2013). Brown

dwarfs and high redshift galaxies can therefore easily be con-
fused with each other. Thus, for many surveys looking for z
> 5 galaxies, brown dwarfs remain the main contaminants.
Where morphological information is not available, it is
still possible to identify M- and L-dwarfs on their red colours
in near infrared (Stanway et al. 2008). They can be distin-
guished from z ∼ 5-6 galaxies on the basis of their spectra.
Like Lyman-break galaxies M- and L-dwarfs show abrupt
breaks in their spectra, but deep molecular absorption lines
in the continuum longwards of the ﬁrst detected break al-
low observers to distinguish them from high redshift galax-
ies. However, spectroscopy has proven to be challenging and
observationally expensive. Spectrographs cannot reach the
continuum level for dim sources with typical magnitudes of
JAB ∼ 27.5 (Wilkins et al. 2014). A good understanding of
the initial mass function (IMF) is also needed, especially at
the low mass end because the IMF can be used to estimate
the fraction of brown dwarfs in surveys.

Several authors have used the small numbers of stars
in deep Hubble observations to determine the distribution
of low-mass stars in the Milky Way. For instance, Pirzkal
et al. (2005) determined the scale-height of diﬀerent types
of dwarfs from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF, Beck-
with et al. 2006). Ryan et al. (2005) found L and T dwarfs
in a small set of ACS parallels. Stanway et al. (2008) and
Pirzkal et al. (2009) determined the Galactic scale-height of
M dwarfs from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Sur-
vey ﬁelds (GOODS, Giavalisco et al. 2004). These studies
gradually improved statistics on distant L, T and M dwarfs
to several dozen objects. The number of known dwarfs in-
creased once again with the WFC3 pure-parallel searches for
z∼8 galaxies (Ryan et al. 2011; Holwerda et al. 2014), taking
advantage of many new sightlines (Figure 1). However, these
studies are limited to the local scale-height of the dwarfs in
the MW disk as the original observations are extra-Galactic
and therefore avoid the plane of the Galaxy.

The IMF is a distribution of stellar and substellar
masses in galaxies when they start to form. From the mass of
a star, its structure and evolution can be inferred. Likewise,
knowing the IMF is a very important step in understanding
theories on star formation in galaxies. It can be seen as the
link between stellar and galactic evolution (Scalo 1986).

The integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF)
gives the total stellar mass function of all stars in a galaxy. It
is the sum of all star formation events in the galaxy which
would be correct in any case in contrast to a galaxy wide
IMF, which was derived from star cluster scales (Weidner
et al. 2013). As the distribution of stellar masses has a big
impact on many aspects of the evolution of galaxies, it is
important to know to what extent the IGIMF deviates from
the underlying stellar IMF (Haas 2010).

In this paper, we derive the number of M-dwarfs in our
Galaxy, which can be helpful for ultimately determining the
IMF and the IGIMF. One can also estimate the amount of
contamination in surveys of high redshift galaxies if mor-
phological information is not available. However, the pri-
mary goal of this study is to ﬁnd the number of M-dwarfs
in our Milky Way galaxy and to learn more about its shape.
For this we will use a model of the exponential disk (van
der Kruit & Searle 1981a) combined with a power-law halo
(Chang et al. 2011) (Section 3).

The ﬁt with the model of the exponential disk has been

done before by Juri´c et al. (2008). They made use of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which has a distance range
from 100 pc to 20 kpc and covers 6500 deg2 of the sky. They
ﬁnd that the number density distribution of stars as traced
by M-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood (D < 2 kpc) can
best be described as having a thin and thick disk. They
estimate a scale height and scale length of the thin and thick
disk of respectively z0 = 0.3 ± 0.06 kpc and h = 2.6 ± 0.52
kpc, and z0 = 0.9 ± 0.18 kpc and h = 3.6 ± 0.72 kpc. In
the same way Pirzkal et al. (2009) derived a scale height
of z0 = 0.3 ± 0.07 kpc for the thin disk, but they made
use of spectroscopically identiﬁed dwarfs with spectral type
M0-M9.
Juri´c et al. (2008) have also ﬁtted the halo and found
for the ﬂattening parameter κ = 0.64 ± 0.13, for the power-
law index p = 2.8 ± 0.56 and for the fraction of halo stars
in the local density fh = 0.005 ± 0.001. Similar results were
obtained by Chang et al. (2011). They made use of the Ks-
band star count of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
and found κ = 0.55 ± 0.15, p = 2.6 ± 0.6 and fh = 0.002 ±
0.001.

In this paper, however, we do not assume the expo-
nential disk consists of two separate components, a distinct
thin and thick disk, like Juri´c et al. (2008) and Chang et al.
(2011) do (see section 3 for a further discussion) but we
treat the disk as a single component. This has also been
done by Holwerda et al. (2014) for a disk-only ﬁt. We make
use of a Python implementation of Goodman and Weare’s
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Ensemble sampler
called emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) and include
a Galactic halo contribution.
This paper is organized as follows: §2 describes our
starting data and how M-dwarfs were identiﬁed, §3 describes
the three models we use in MCMC to describe the distribu-
tion of M-dwarfs in the BoRG data, §4 describes out imple-
mentation of the MCMC ﬁt to this problem, §5 describes the
analysis of the three MCMC models in detail and the implied
number of M-dwarfs, §6 is our discussion of the results. §7
lists our conclusions and §8 outlined future options for the
discovery and modeling of M-dwarfs with e.g., EUCLID or
WFIRST.

2 DATA

For the model ﬁts we use data similar to Table 14 in Holw-
erda et al. (2014) and new reduced data acquired from the
BoRG survey (Trenti et al. 2011). This is a pure-parrallel
program with the Hubble Space Telescope using the Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3). The survey targets the brightest
galaxies at z ∼ 8, suspected to be the prime source of reion-
izing photons in the early Universe (Bradley et al. 2012;
Schmidt et al. 2014). The strategy of four ﬁlters, three near-
infrared ones and a single optical one, has now been shown to
work extremely well to identify and approximate type brown
dwarfs (Ryan et al. 2011; Holwerda et al. 2014). The pure-
parallel nature of the program ensures random sampling of
sky, lowering cosmic variance errors.

the BoRG survey are not positioned in the disk but in the
halo.

2.2

Identifying Brown Dwarfs

The brown dwarfs used in this research were found with
the BoRG survey. Observations were made with the Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST) during a pure parallel program. The WFC3
was taking exposures whilst the HST was pointing for pri-
mary spectroscopic observations on e.g., quasars (Figure 1).
The near-random pointing nature of the program makes sure
the BoRG ﬁelds are minimally aﬀected by ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld (cos-
mic) variance (Trenti & Stiavelli 2008) and is therefore ideal
to ﬁnd the density distribution of M-dwarfs. The survey is
designed to identify high redshift galaxies and uses four dif-
ferent ﬁlters: F 098W , F 125W , F 160W and F 606W . The

2.1 New Galactic Coordinates

The data table in Holwerda et al. (2014) contains an in-
advertent problematic error: the Galactic coordinates are
not correctly computed and thus the height above the plane
and the galactic radius for all dwarfs are not correct. We
traced this error back to an incorrect coordinate transfor-
mation in the package PyEphem (Rhodes 2011) where the
equatorial coordinates were not correctly transformed into
galactic coordinates. The galactic coordinates were recal-

band (F125W) of M-dwarfs from Hawley et al. (2002).

F 098W ﬁlter is designed to select the redshift z ∼ 7.5 galax-
ies (Y-band dropouts), F 125W and F 160W are used for
source detection and characterization, and F 606W is used
to control contamination from low redshift galaxies, AGN’s
and cool Milky Way stars like brown dwarfs.

The brown dwarfs in the BoRG ﬁelds were identiﬁed
from their morphology and colour. Using the bona-ﬁde M-
dwarf catalog for the CANDELS survey, three morphological
selection criteria are deﬁned in Holwerda et al. (2014): the
half-light parameter, the ﬂux ratio between two predeﬁned
apertures (stellarity index) and the relation between the
brightest pixel surface brightness and total source luminosity
(mu max/mag auto ratio). The selection criteria are deﬁned
such that they picked out the 24 by the PEARS project spec-
troscopically identiﬁed M-dwarfs (Pirzkal et al. 2009). The
half-light parameter and the mu max/mag auto worked well
for stellar selection brighter than 24 mag (adopted here), and
the half-light radius includes much fewer interlopers down
to 25.5 mag. The half-light parameter and the stellarity se-
lection criteria seemed to be the most appropriate for the
BoRG ﬁelds because the locus of stellar points turned out
to be within the criteria lines. The mu max/mag auto cri-
terion did not work as well because this criterion is sensitive
to pixel size and the CANDELS data was originally at a dif-
ferent pixel size. Therefore, the half-light parameter is used
as the morphological selection criterion.
The various spectral types (M, L, T) are identiﬁed by
construction of a JF 125W − HF 160W vs. YF 098M − JF 125W
near-infrared colour-colour diagram. The colour-colour cri-
terion to select M-dwarfs is based on the distribution of the
PEARS-identiﬁed M-dwarfs in the CANDELS and ERS cat-
alog. The colour-colour criterion to select M-, T- and L-
dwarfs is drawn from Ryan et al. (2011).

To ﬁnd the subtypes of the found M-type dwarfs a lin-
ear relation is ﬁtted to PEARS-identiﬁed M-dwarfs in CAN-
DELS. This ﬁt can be found in Figure 14 in Holwerda et al.
(2014). The linear relation is expressed by Equation 3.
M type = 3.39 × [VF 606W − JF 125W ] − 3.78
which directly implies a distance:

with m the apparent magnitude and M the absolute magni-
tude. We note that BoRG photometry is already corrected
for Galactic extinction. In principle, the Galactic reddening
is an upper limit to the amount of extinction by dust in

the case of Galactic objects such as these M-dwarfs. How-
ever, with these high-lattitude ﬁelds, the diﬀerence would be
minimal compared to the photometric error. The absolute
magnitude is correlated with subtype, this correlation was
found by Hawley et al. (2002) and is given in Table 1. The
apparent magnitude is measured and given in Table 14 in
Holwerda et al. (2014) and our Table 9.

2.3 Data Limitations

There is still the possibility of contamination by M-type gi-
ants, other type subdwarfs, and AGN’s in the data set but
this is considered to be small. For example, the on-sky den-
sity of M-giants is 4.3 × 10−5 M-giants/arcmin2 (Holwerda
et al. 2014; Bochanski et al. 2014) which makes it unlikely
that one is included in the data set. A similar argument
applies to nearby other type subdwarfs, the volume probed
at close distances is very small. We are conﬁdent that the
morphological selection, luminosity limit, and the colour-
colour restriction select a very clean sample of Milky Way
M-dwarfs.

The saturation limit for the BoRG sextractor catalogs
was kept at 50000 ADU, corresponding to a bright limiting
magnitude of ∼6.6 AB mag. This places no upper brightness
(i.e. lower distance) limit on the M-dwarf catalog. Unlike
STIS or ACS-SBC, the WFC3/IR channel has no oﬃcial
object brightness limits and none were implemented for the
BoRG observations.

The BoRG survey’s detection limits in J-band (F125W,
varying from 26 to 27.5, form ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld, Figure 3) imme-
diately inform us that M0 type brown dwarfs will be detected
in the largest volume while the latest M-types in the small-
est. Assuming an mlim ∼ 27, this implies detection limits
ranging from ∼ 8 kpc (M9) to 85 kpc (M0) (See also Table
1). We note that these limiting distances are well into the
Galactic Halo. For the shallowest ﬁeld (mlim = 25 AB), this
translates to 3.5 (M9) and 35 (M0), still well out of the disk
and into the Halo. The majority of our data is for M0/1 type

M-dwarfs, for which the BoRG survey eﬀectively samples up
to ∼ 30 kpc or well into the Halo.

Unless they are in the Solar neighborhood, any bina-
ries in the BoRG ﬁeld catalog will be single star entries. For
example, Aberasturi et al. (2014) estimate the binary frac-
tions of nearby (< 20 pc) T-dwarfs using WFC3 at ∼16-24%
and they discuss how this conﬁrms lower binary fractions
with lower mass primaries. For M-dwarf primaries, the bi-
nary fraction is closer to 30-50% (e.g., Janson et al. 2012).
That binary fraction is derived for nearby M-dwarfs in the
disk and the fraction in the halo may be much lower (e.g. as
the product of multiple star system ejection mechanisms).
At a ﬁducial distance of 10 kpc, the 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 PSF of WFC3,
would only be able to resolve a binary with 1 kAU separa-
tion. Therefore, we assume that each star identiﬁed here is a
single M-dwarf. The factor 2 in ﬂux (0.2 mag) is within the
typical uncertainty of the sextractor photometry. This
bias is somewhat accounted for in the relatively low ﬁducial
value we have given the data (f ), i.e. individual data-points
are noisy.

2.4 Local Overdensities

The model used in this paper (Section 3) are for smooth
stellar distributions. Substructures such as spiral arms, stel-
lar streams and satellites, are not accounted for. To include
these structures we need a model with many more param-
eters. The ﬁtting of such a model lies beyond the scope of
this data and this paper. Instead, we exclude ﬁelds in which
we suspect these kinds of contamination and ﬁt the remain-
ing ﬁelds. We look for ﬁelds that show an strong overdensity
and reject them based on their positions.
Two ﬁelds in the data set contain clear overdensities:
borg 1230 + 0750 and borg 1815 − 3244. The overdensity of
the ﬁrst can be explained by the fact that its position is
exactly on the Sagittarius stellar stream (Majewski et al.
2003; Belokurov et al. 2006; Holwerda et al. 2014). The 22
M-dwarfs found in the ﬁeld are therefore discarded for our
analysis. We discard borg 1815 − 3244 because of its low
Galactic latitude and it is close to the plane of the disk. As a
result of its position, the ﬁeld is vulnerable to contamination.
Another overdensity is positioned at Galactic latitude
-30◦ and Galactic longitude -90◦. It contains 5 M-dwarfs
which is high in comparison with the other ﬁelds. While
keeping in mind that one of the eight newly discovered
satellite galaxies, found by The DES Collaboration et al.
(2015), was close to this position, we plot the positions of
those satellite galaxies to see if they match the position of
the overdensity. We also plot the already known satellite
galaxies to see if there is any overlap (Figure 1). The ﬁelds
borg 0436 − 5259, borg 0439 − 5317 and borg 0440 − 5244
are positioned around one of the known satellite galaxies.
We also see that borg 1031 + 5052 and borg 1033 + 5051 are
close to the galaxies found by the DES collaboration (Figure
1). In most cases the positions of the galaxies diﬀer too much
from the positions of the ﬁelds, about 2◦, for the galaxies to
be the cause of any overdensities. We therefore include these
ﬁelds in our analysis. Out of the 72 ﬁelds of the BoRG2013
sample, we exclude two for obvious overdensities.

3 A 3-D MODEL OF THE MILKY WAY DISK

The Milky Way Galaxy can be divided into four diﬀerent
components: the bulge, the halo, the thin disk and the thick
disk, although the existence of distinct disks is sometimes
questioned (e.g., Bovy et al. 2012). The halo is built up
from the stellar halo and the dark matter halo. The stellar
halo contains about 2-10% of the stellar mass in the Galaxy,
mostly old stars with low metallicity. The bulge is a stellar
system located in the center. It is thicker than the disk and
it contains about 15% of the total luminosity of the Galaxy.
The stars in the bulge are believed to date from the begin-
ning of the Galaxy. Because of lack of coverage on the Bulge,
we discount this component in the following analysis.

The thick disk was discovered by star counts (Yoshii
1982; Gilmore & Reid 1983) and contains stars that are older
and have diﬀerent composition from those in the thin disk.
The thick disk is believed to be created when the infant thin
disk encountered a smaller galaxy and the young disk was
heated kinematically (Binney & Tremaine 2008). The thin
and thick disk were believed to be distinct but recent re-
search questions this. Bovy et al. (2012) examined the [α/Fe]
ratio, which is a proxy for age, of stars and their distribu-
tion. They found that old stars are distributed in disks with a
small scale length and a great scale height and that, with de-
creasing age, the stars are distributed in disks with increas-
ing scale length and decreasing scale height. Similar results
were found by Cheng et al. (2012) and Bensby et al. (2011).
In addition to this, Bovy et al. (2012) found a smoothly de-
creasing function approximately ΣR(h) ∝ exp(−h) for the
surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with scale
height h. This would not be expected if there was a clear
distinction between the thick and the thin disk. In addition,
Chang et al. (2011) tried to ﬁt diﬀerent models for the thin
and thick disk and found a degeneracy between all the pa-
rameters of those thin and thick disk models. We found a
similar degeneracy in our model only using a disk model.
They made use of the 2MASS catalog, which is an all sky
survey. This sample should have been wide and deep enough
to break degeneracies (Juri´c et al. 2008). It seems therefore
not useful to use two diﬀerent models for the thin and thick
disk. In this research we assume one model for the disk,
presented in the next section.

3.1 Galactic Disk Model

For the disk we assume the following shape, which was found
studying the three-dimensional light distribution in galactic
disks (van der Kruit & Searle 1981a):

(cid:18) z

(cid:19)

ρ(R, z) = ρ0 e

− R

(5)

where ρ(R, z) is the dwarf number density in a point in the
disk, ρ0 the central number density, R the galactocentric
radius, h the scale length, z the height above the plane and
z0 the scale height of the disk. This is the ﬁrst model we
ﬁt to the numbers of M-dwarfs. To remain consistent with
other exponential ﬁts to the Milky Way disk, we report the
ﬁtted values for ρ0/4 and z0/2 (see also van der Kruit &

3.2 Galactic Halo Model

The model used for ﬁtting the halo (Equation 6) is based on
the model of Chang et al. (2011) and contains a normaliza-
tion for the position of the sun:

(cid:18) R2 + (z/κ)2

(cid:19)−p/2

R2(cid:12) + (z(cid:12)/κ)2

ρ(R, z) = ρ(cid:12) fh

,

(6)

where ρ(R, z) is the dwarf number density at a point in the
halo, R the galactocentric radius and z the height above
the plane. (R(cid:12), z(cid:12)) is the position of the Sun: (8.5 kpc,
0.027 kpc). ρ(cid:12)(R(cid:12), z(cid:12)) is the local density, which is the
density within a radius of 20 pc of the sun. This was found
by Reid et al. (2008). fh represents the fraction of stars in
the local density that belong to the halo. The combination of
the fraction, local density and normalization for the position
of the sun can be seen as the central number density. κ is
the ﬂattening parameter and p is the power-law index of the
halo.

The halo model has diﬀerent parameters from the expo-
nential disk model. The ﬂattening parameter κ is a measure
a − b
a

for the compression of a sphere. It is deﬁned as κ =
with a the semi-major axis and b semi-minor axis. Because
of this deﬁnition of κ, it must be between 0 and 1. The
power-law index of the halo p is the other new ﬁt parameter
and a positive number, due to the ﬁnite extent of the Milky
Way (Helmi 2008).

3.3 Galactic Disk+Halo Model

For the ﬁt with the halo and disk a combination of Equations
5 and 6 is used:

which is the model we ﬁt to the numbers of M-dwarfs in
section 5.2.

because we are taking this ratio for the same physical model
(see Section 4.2). The posterior distribution is educed to:
P(θ|y, x, σ) ∝ P(y | x, θ, σ, f )P(θ)

(9)

To ﬁnd an estimate for the parameters we need to marginal-
ize the posterior distribution over nuisance parameters. This
can by done with MCMC. An example of marginalization is
shown in equation 10 where P(θ1|d) is the marginalized pos-
terior distribution for the parameter θ1 (Trotta 2008):
P(θ1|d) =

P(θ|d)dθ2 . . . dθn

(cid:90)

(10)

4.1.1 Priors

The MCMC implementation allows one to set priors for each
of the variables; the ranges of plausible values for each vari-
able. We set them such that they exclude unphysical sce-
narios, negative densities, but these priors are not a hard
top-hat; instead, their probability is set as very low. In the
case of an unphysical model, the MCMC model can in fact
iterate towards an unphysical solution. Such unphysical pa-
rameter values, possibly in combination with highly quan-
tized posterior (a poorly mixed MCMC chain) are one way
to identify a poor model.

4.1.2 Advantage of Bayesian Analysis

The main advantage of Bayesian analysis is that the method
gives a basis for quantifying uncertainties in model param-
eters based on observations. The Bayesian posterior prob-
ability distribution depends on observations and the prior
knowledge of the model parameters.

The most criticized aspect of the Bayesian analysis is
the necessity of deﬁning the prior probability density. This
prior can often be well estimated with the available data. In
cases where this estimation is diﬃcult the posterior distri-
bution can be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the choice of the
prior probability density. These kind of problems can also
be found in frequentist methods where the choice of model
parameters inﬂuences the results (Ford 2006).

4.2 MCMC Implementation

To ﬁnd the best ﬁtting model we use Bayesian analysis,
which is a standard procedure in astronomy when measure-
ment results are compared to predictions of a parameter-
dependent model.

4.1 Bayesian Analysis

For the Bayesian analysis we are using Bayes’ theorem:

P(y | x, θ, σ, f )P(θ)

,

P(y | x, σ)

P(θ|y, x, σ) =
(8)
with P(θ|y, x, σ) the posterior distribution, P(y | x, θ, σ, f )
the likelihood of y given (x, θ, σ, f) and P(θ) the prior
probability density. The prior probability density needs to
be deﬁned for the model parameters. This deﬁnition is based
on previous research and observational data. P(y | x, σ) is
the normalization constant which we assume is a constant

For this research we use emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013), a Python implementation of the Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) Ensemble sampler, to ﬁt the model in Equa-
tion 7 to the data, with the Metropolis-Hastings method
(We ﬁt 5 and 6 as well with nonphysical results). MCMC
provides us with an eﬃcient way of solving the multidimen-
sional integrals that we saw in the Bayesian analysis of mod-
els with many parameters. For a more in-depth explanation
of MCMC, we refer the reader to Foreman-Mackey et al.
(2013).

4.3 Fit Variables
We use the likelihood for P(y | x, θ, σ, f ) (Equation 10) over
all stars:

log-likelihood function. So with this module we use the neg-
ative log-likelihood function, which achieves the same. In
doing so, we ﬁnd the best starting values of the free param-
eters. The optimization module makes use of true parame-
ters which are an initial guess for the parameters. We choose
the Nelder-Mead method because of it robustness (Kiusalaas
2013).

We use three separate terms for the parameters in the
models: the true value, best-ﬁt value, and the optimum
value. The “true” value is the initial guess supplied to the
maximum-likelyhood ﬁt, the best-ﬁt value is the maximum
likelihood best ﬁt, fed in turn to the MCMC, and the op-
timum value is the value corresponding to the peak of the
distribution found by MCMC.

5.2 Disk+Halo Fit

We perform a ﬁt with the halo-disk model. We have also
ruled out pure-halo and pure-disk models, based on the un-
physical or unrealistic parameter values and a highly quan-
tized posterior (the sign of an unmixing Markov chain). The
true parameters are still the same as in the separate ﬁts de-
scribed above. The optimized parameters can be found in
Table 2. For the ﬁt with all of the parameters we get the
results found in Table 2. These seem reasonable apart from
the value for fh which is unexpectedly small. Figure 5 shows
the corner plot made with data from subtype 0 to 9. It shows
a degeneracy between fh and δD. h–ρ0, p–κ and h–δD also
show some degeneracy, notably the distribution of ρ0 is very
peaked.

Figure 4. The conversion of surface density to volume density
with δD, one of the free parameters in our MCMC ﬁt.

In our case y is the density of brown dwarfs ρ(R, z), x is
given by R and z, model is given by Equation 7 for each nth
star and θ is the set of free parameters for the model. For
sn we now have:

(11)

(12)

n + f 2 (model)2,

s2
n = σ2
f 2 (model)2 contains the jitter which consists of all the noise
not included in the measurement noise estimation σn, the er-
ror on the density of brown dwarfs ρ(R, z) (Hou et al. 2012).
So f gives the fraction of bad data and is a free parameter in
the model. Marginalizing f has the desirable eﬀect of treat-
ing anything in the data that cannot be explained by the
model as noise, leading to the most conservative estimates
of the parameters (Gregory 2005).

To compute the volume density ρ(R, z) at each position
of M-dwarfs, we ﬁrst calculate the physical area at the in-
ferred distance of the BoRG survey ﬁeld in which the dwarf
was found; the surface density. Then we multiply it with a
bin-width δD to get the volume density (Figure 4). This bin-
width is a free parameter in the model. The physical area is
calculated with the length of the ﬁeld. This length is given
by Equation 13 with the typical size of the usable area of the
observed BoRG ﬁeld (ABoRG in arcminutes, typically about
a WFC3 ﬁeld-of-view). The volume density is now given by
Equation 14.
L = 2 tan(ABoRG) × d

ρ =

L2 × δD

Because δD is a free parameter the models we are going to
ﬁt, will now look like Equation 15.

5 ANALYSIS

To ﬁnd the best ﬁt of the data for our model, we need to
ﬁnd the numerical optimum of the log-likelihood function
(Equation 11) to get a starting position for MCMC. For
this we use the module scipy.optimize. This minimizes func-
tions, whereas we would like to ﬁnd the maximum of the

5.2.1 Fixing Parameters

To improve the results of the ﬁrst ﬁt, we ﬁx parameters of
which the value is well known or of which the value is hard
to constrain with the used data. The latter is the case with
the scale length. Because all the lines-of-sight in our dataset
are out of the plane of the Galactic disk (Figure 1), it is
diﬃcult to ﬁnd a constraint on the scale length of the disk.
Therefore we take a ﬁxed value for the scale length at 2.6
kpc, as was found by Juri´c et al. (2008). Figure 6 shows

the corresponding corner plot. We can see the degeneracy
between fh and δD and a degeneracy between δD and ρ0
has appeared. κ–p and fh–ρ0 show some degeneracy. The
distribution of ρ0 is not peaked in contrast what we saw in
Figure 5. Adding additional constraints did not show real
improvement in comparison with the ﬁt with all parameters
free and the ﬁt with the scale length ﬁxed. We ﬁxed the
power-law index p and the central number density ρ0, but
there was no improvement in doing so. The results for the
ﬁt with the scale length seems to be the best.

5.2.2 Fit as a function of M-dwarf subtype

The halo-disk model with h ﬁxed at 2.6 kpc yields the best
model. With the results from this ﬁt we ﬁnd out if there is
a correlation between the ﬁt parameters and the M-dwarf
subtypes. We do this for subtype 0 to 5 because we have too
little data on the later and dimmer subtypes (Table 5). Fig-
ure 7 shows a subtype-parameter plot for the parameter z0.
There is no obvious correlation of scale-height (z0) with M-
dwarf subtype. This is also the case for every other parame-
ter. In addition, when calculating the errors per subtype, we
see that they are too large for the subtype-parameter plots
to be reliable. This will be further discussed in section 6.1.

5.2.3 A check on Degenerate Parameters

As a check on the eﬀect of degenerate parameters, we change
the starting “true” parameter value of δD from 1 pc into 100
pc in the ﬁt of the halo-disk model. Table 4 summarizes
the results of the two MCMC runs. The biggest diﬀerences
are found for δD, fh and ρ0. This can be explained by the
degeneracies with δD that show up in Figure 5. The values of
the total likelihoods are not the same: -2072.23 is found for
δD = 100 pc and -2080.02 is found for δD = 1 pc but similar
enough to be explained by these parameter degeneracies,
which can result in multiple ’global’ optima.

Table 3. Halo-disk model (h = 2.6 kpc): optimized values and
best ﬁt values. Because these are our ﬁnal model values, we di-
vided z0 by 2 and ρ0 by a factor 4 to facilitate comparisons with
exponential models in the Literature.

5.3 Volume Density

The volume density of M-dwarfs as a function of height
above the plane of the Milky Way disk plots are given in
Figure 8. The plots are made with the best value found for
the parameters. If, for example, the volume density distri-
bution is forced into the shape of the disk-only model, the
vertical distribution is too wide to represent anything that
one could consider a disk (10s of kpc scale-heights). Sim-
ilarly, if one considers the distribution of M-dwarfs in the
shape of the halo-only model, the distribution does not look
natural. This is in contrast with Figure 8 where the distribu-
tion does seem reasonable (cf Figure 2 and 8). This indicates
that the ﬁt of the halo with κ ﬁxed and ﬁt of the halo-disk
model with h ﬁxed are more reliable.

Figure 5. Halo-disk model: corner plot containing subtypes M0 up to and including M9. The dotted lines give the 16th and 84th
percentiles which are used for the uncertainties (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014).

All of the plots also show that the later subtype brown
dwarfs (M6-M9) are found near the plane (z = 0) of the
disk, while one would expect most of them to be in the halo
because of their age. This can be explained by the fact that
we are not as sensitive to the dimmer M6-M9 dwarfs in the
halo as we are to the earlier subtypes.

5.4 Total number and mass of M-dwarfs

The total number of M-dwarfs in the disk can be determined
by integrating Equation 5 over the cylindrical coordinates R,
z and θ. The limits chosen are commonly used for the limits
of our Galaxy.

late a lower and upper limit for the mass (Reid et al. 2004;

2014), M81 (Barker et al. 2009), M253 (Bailin et al. 2011), M101
(van Dokkum et al. 2014).

They give the relation between stellar mass accreted early
through galaxy mergers and the total stellar mass.

The fraction of halo stars we found is 7+5−4%, higher than
the 2% fraction found by Courteau et al. (2011). In Figure
9 we display the found value for the fraction and the total
stellar mass of the Milky Way of Courteau et al. (2011) with
the model of Cooper et al. (2013). We see that our value
found for the halo fraction of the Milky Way lies within the
margins of the model. We note that our disk+halo model
does not include the bulge (or a thick disk component) and
so our fraction of 7% is an upper limit of the halo fraction of
stars. Assuming a 15% bulge contribution to the bulge+disk
galaxy total, this halo fraction would be 6%. We note that
the 7% value is uncertain and it is still in agreement within
2σ with the Courteau et al. (2011) value.

The resulting inferred number of M-dwarfs in the Milky Way
disk and their lower and upper mass estimates are summa-
rized in Table 6. A total of ∼ 109M(cid:12) of the mass of the Milky
Way disk is in ∼ 58 × 109 M-type brown dwarf members.

6 DISCUSSION

6.1 Errors on subtype

5.5 Halo Fraction

We can ﬁnd the fraction of halo M-dwarfs and compare it
with the numerical simulations from Cooper et al. (2013).

The errors on the subtypes of brown dwarfs are calculated
with Equation 20. To ﬁnd the average error on one subtype,
the photometric errors in the color calculation are quadrati-
cally added for all the stars of that subtype. We perform this
check to verify if a ﬁt per subtype (Section 5.2.2) is feasible.

Table 7. Error on subtypes.

The results of these type error can be found in Table 7. The
found average type errors are quite large, especially the ones
on subtype M0, M2 and M9. Any relation found with the ﬁt
per subtype is therefore doubtful. A brown dwarf subtyped
as M2 could well be any other subtype with these errors.

There are a few large errors on the F 606W ﬁlter mag-
nitude which cause these large values. The magnitude errors
could also be due to the fact that used data was taken with
two diﬀerent ﬁlters (F 606W and F 600LP for the BoRG and
HIPPIES survey respectively). The photometry in Holwerda
et al. (2014) was done with F 606W , but because part of the
ﬁelds were not observed with this particular ﬁlter, a correc-
tion had to be made. Three ﬁelds were observed with both
of the ﬁlters in question. They found the colour diﬀerence
and corrected the magnitudes for F 606W and increased the
respective errors.

However, the close relation between optical-infrared
color and subtype observed by Holwerda et al. (2014) in
CANDELS data raises the possibility that with higher-
ﬁdelity photometry and/or multi-band photometry, brown
dwarf photometric typing and sub-typing may be feasible in
the future.

6.2 Comparison

When we compare the found values with the best working
model (halo-disk model) with values from earlier research
they are in excellent agreement (Table 8). Especially the
scale-height found here compares well with those for other
types of brown dwarfs in other surveys (e.g., Pirzkal et al.
(2009) or Ryan et al. (2011)) with slightly improved errors
thanks to the multiple lines-of-sight, the MCMC approach
and the inclusion of the second, halo component.

We constrain the halo parameters better than the
2MASS survey model, thanks to the depth of the data and
the unambiguous identiﬁcation of stellar objects and M-
dwarfs in HST data. We can attribute this to the trade be-
tween depth and survey area resulting in a relatively large
survey volume which is more optimized for the halo.

7 CONCLUSIONS

From our MCMC model of the number of M-dwarf stars
found the in BoRG survey, we conclude:

(i) The disk+halo model works best, a single component

model results in unphysical results.

(ii) We found the following values for the parameters:

(a) The scale height: z0 = 0.29±0.02 kpc

(b) The central number density: ρ0 = 0.29+0.20−0.13 #/pc3
(c) The power law index: p = 2.4±0.07
(d) The ﬂattening parameter: κ = 0.45±0.04
(e) The local halo fraction: fh = 0.0075+0.0025
−0.0019
(f) The bin-width: δD = 0.31+0.09−0.08 kpc

(iii) We found that fh–δD and κ–p are degenerate. We
could not ﬁnd any correlation between subtype and param-
eter.
(iv) The total number of M-dwarfs in the halo and disk
is: 58.2 +9.3−6.2 × 109. The upper limit of the halo fraction is
7+5−4%.

(v) The upper and lower limit of the total mass of M-
dwarfs in the halo and disk are respectively: Mupper = 1.99
+0.73−0.50 × 109 M(cid:12) and Mlower = 0.32 +0.12−0.081 × 109 M(cid:12).

8 FUTURE WORK

The counts in random HST ﬁelds of the lowest-mass stars
and brown dwarfs (to model their distribution and number
in the Milky Way) will serve in future years for two impor-
tant new astronomical space missions, EUCLID and JWST.
EUCLID will map most of the sky to a similar depth, spa-
tial resolution, and ﬁlters as the BoRG survey. With im-
proved brown dwarfs statistics, the current model will be-
come an more accurate measure for the shape and structure
of the Milky Way disk and halo. The EUCLID mission will
be able to detect nearly all streams and satellite galaxies of
the Milky Way: all halo substructure can be detected using
these objects as the tracer (Laureijs et al. 2011). Given their
ubiquity, stellar overdensities stand out in greater contrast
(Holwerda et al. 2014). Once a full tally has been made, the
implications for the Galaxy-wide and halo IMF can be ex-
plored. JWST is a precision near-infrared observatory. To
accurately map spectroscopic instruments such as NIRspec,
onboard JWST, onto distant targets, a multitude of NIR-
bright reference points will be needed (Holwerda et al. in
