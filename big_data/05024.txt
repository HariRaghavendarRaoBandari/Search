Since its inception about two centuries ago thermodynamics has sparkled continuous interest
and fundamental questions. According to the second law no heat engine working between two
heat reservoirs at temperatures T1 > T2 can have an eﬃciency larger than Carnot’s eﬃciency
ηC = 1 − T2/T1. The latter can be achieved by the Carnot engine, which however ideally operates
in inﬁnite time, hence delivers null power. A question that is currently in the limelight of current
investigation is whether the Carnot eﬃciency can be achieved at ﬁnite power [1–5]. Most of the
previous works addressed this question within the Onsager matrix formalism of linear response
theory. Here we pursue a diﬀerent route based on ﬁnite-size-scaling theory. We focus on quantum
Otto engines and show that when the working substance is at the verge of a second order phase
transition diverging energy ﬂuctuations can enable the asymptotic approach towards the Carnot
point at ﬁnite power. The rate of such approach is dictated by the critical indices, thus showing the
universal character of our analysis.

Increasing the power output of a heat engine has a
corresponding cost in terms of reduced eﬃciency η; or,
in equivalent terms, a larger deviation ∆η = ηC − η from
the Carnot eﬃciency ηC . A question that is currently
the object of vigorous research eﬀorts is whether it is
possible to devise a heat engine that outputs ﬁnite power
at Carnot eﬃciency [1–5].
In the following we address
this question by focussing on the the following quantity

an interaction between the N constituents of the working
substance could provide the extra scaling power that is
needed for a positive resolution, see Fig. 1. In order to
address that question quantitatively we consider a special
engine cycle that is well studied in the literature (see, e.g.
[6–8] and reference therein), namely a quantum version
of the Otto engine [9–14], see Fig. 2. We will show
that a universal behaviour, with anomalous scaling of
the performance rate

that is the ratio of power output P over ∆η. We shall call
˙Π the performance rate. It is trivially possible to increase
the power without aﬀecting the eﬃciency by scaling the
size of the working substance: An array of N identical en-
gines working in parallel provides an N -fold larger power
than each of them, at the same eﬃciency. In this case
the output work per cycle and eﬃciency scale as P ∼ N ,
and ∆η ∼ 1, consequently ˙Π ∼ N .1 Note that this linear
increase in performance rate does not represent any real
gain as it is achieved at the cost of a corresponding linear
increase of resources. The question is therefore “Can the
scaling of the performance rate ˙Π be improved beyond
linear” in order to have a true gain? Note that a positive
answer implies (in an asymptotic sense) a positive an-
swer to the fundamental question posed above: Imagine
to have a working substance made up of N constituents
(or resources); if ˙Π ∼ N 1+a, with a > 0, then one could
approach Carnot eﬃciency as ∆η ∼ P/ ˙Π ∼ N −a → 0
by increasing N , while keeping the “power per resource”
ﬁxed i.e., P ∼ N .

In the following we will provide a positive answer to
the question above. The main idea that we pursue is that

1 Here the symbol ∼ means “scales as”

emerges when the working substance is on the verge of a
second order phase transition. Here α, ν, z are the spe-
ciﬁc heat, correlation length and dynamical critical expo-
nent, and d is the number of dimensions of the working
substance. Note that the performance rate contains two
concurrent contributions, one stemming from the scaling
of the heat capacity, i.e. the exponent α, and one stem-
ming from the scaling of the relaxation time, i.e., the
exponent z. Since d,ν > 0, in order to have a more than
linear behaviour of ˙Π one needs a working substance with
a critical point characterised by the inequality α−zν > 0.

FIG. 2: A quantum Otto engine. At time t = 0 the WS is
in thermal equilibrium with bath 1 and λ = λ1. During the
ﬁrst stroke the WS undergoes a thermally isolated transfor-
mation where the Hamiltonian switches from H WS
1 = λ1K to
H WS
2 = λ2K. The second stroke consists in thermalisation
with bath 2, at λ being kept ﬁxed at λ2. During the third
stroke the Hamiltonian goes back to H WS
1 = λ1K while in
thermal isolation. The fourth stroke consists in letting the
system thermalise with bath 1, with λ being kept ﬁxed at λ1.

fact that was never noticed before, see Eq. (9) below.

N-body quantum Otto engine.– The quantum Otto
engine (see Fig.2) is a four-stroke engine based on a
working-substance (WS) with Hamiltonian4

H WS(t) = λ(t)K.

(5)

The heats released in the baths during the thermalisa-
tion strokes are Qi = ∓λi[UK(β2λ2) − UK(β1λ1)], where
UK(θ) = Tr K e−θK/Tr e−θK is the internal energy asso-
ciated to the base Hamiltonian K at inverse temperature
θ, and −, + is for i = 1, 2 respectively. The work per-
formed by the engine Wout = Q1 + Q2 is thus

Wout = (λ2 − λ1)[UK(β2λ2) − UK(β1λ1)].

(6)

For β1 < β2, the condition Wout ≥ 0, Q1 ≥ 0 deﬁnes
the regime of operation of the engine as a heat engine,
implying λ2/λ1 ≥ β1/β2. The eﬃciency is

The eﬃciency is smaller than ηC in accordance with the
heat engine ﬂuctuation relation [22, 23].

With Eq. (7) the output work of the quantum Otto
engine can be expressed as a function of ∆η = λ2/λ1 −
β1/β2 as

ensures the asymptotic approach toward the Carnot
point at ﬁnite power. Is that possible? Although typ-
ically Eq. (3) is not satisﬁed,2 there is no fundamental
reason hindering this possibility. Note that it is even pos-
sible to have cases where, rather than slowing down (i.e.
z > 0 which is the most common case), the dynamics
actually speeds up at the critical point (z < 0)[17–20],
in which case the two terms would add up.3 Below we
shall illustrate how such powerful critical Carnot engines
should be designed. The only obstacles hindering their
practical implementation appear to be of technological
nature. We conclude that there is no fundamental rea-
son hindering the possibility of a powerful Carnot engine.
At the heart of our result is the recognition that scaling

of the performance, i.e.

Π =

where Wout is the work output per cycle, is dictated by
the heat capacity of the working substance (which can

This expression allows us to study the performance Π. In
the region where linear approximation hold, i.e., ∆η ≪ 1
(namely β1λ1 is close to β2λ2), the scaling of the en-
gine’s performance Π with N is given by the scaling of
dWout/d∆η|∆η=0, i.e. the slope of Wout(∆η) at the ori-
gin. This is illustrated in Fig.3.
In the case of N de-
vices in parallel it is Wout = N W single
(here W single
denotes the work of each single device), hence trivially
dWout/d∆η|∆η=0 ∼ Π ∼ N , and, accordingly ˙Π ∼ N ,
as we noted before.
It follows that in order to boost
the scaling of the performance it is necessary to have the
slope dWout/d∆η|∆η=0 to scale more than linearly.

and z ≃ 2.35 [16] hence α − zν ≃ −0.28.

[19], hence α − zν ≃ 1.08 > 1, for Dy2Ti2O7.

4 Following the current literature we call these engines “quantum
Otto engines” although they bear no other quantum feature be-
sides the discreteness of the spectrum. Accordingly there is noth-
ing genuinely quantum in our treatment.

FIG. 3: Graphical demonstration of the statement: Π ∼
dWout/d∆η|∆η=0. The graph shows various plots of Wout(∆η)
for increasing values of N (from lower to upper curves). At a
ﬁxed work output (horizontal red line), the curves are in-
tercepted at decreasing values of ∆η.
If the slope at the
origin increases with a power N a, dWout/d∆η|∆η=0 ∼ N a,
then, provided for larger and larger N the intercept occurs
in the region where the linear approximation holds for the
N th curve, the approach towards ∆η = 0 occurs as 1/N a,
hence Π = Wout/∆η ∼ N a ∼ dWout/d∆η|∆η=0. Similarly,
one might rise (lower) the value of Wout with N , e.g., as
Wout(∆η) = wN b. Accordingly, provided for larger and larger
N the intercept still occurs in region where the linear ap-
proximation holds, the approach towards ∆η = 0 occurs as
1/N a−b. Still, Π = Wout/∆η ∼ N a ∼ dWout/d∆η|∆η=0.

point that is very close to the Carnot point, i.e. chose λ1
and λ2 so that their ratio λ1/λ2 is very close to β2/β1.
After the adiabatic compression stroke the working sub-
stance reaches a new temperature T ′
2) that is
very close to the cold bath temperature T2 = 1/(kBβ2):
T ′
2 = T1λ2/λ1 = T2 + ∆T2, with a small ∆T2. The
larger the heat capacity CK = N cK of the working sub-
stance, at the thermalisation point, the larger the heat
exchanged Q2 = CK∆T2 during the subsequent thermal-
isation with the cold bath. Likewise for the subsequent
expansion and thermalisation. Since Wout = Q1 + Q2,
the larger the heat capacity the larger the work output,
and accordingly the larger the performance.

Eq. (9) tells us that in order to achieve super-linear
scaling of the performance, one needs a working sub-
stance with an anomalous scaling of the speciﬁc heat.
Recall that for ordinary substances, the heat capacity is
extensive CK ∼ N , namely cK = CK/N ∼ 1. What is
needed for improved performance is cK ∼ N a, with some
a > 0. This can happen at the verge of a phase transi-
tion. The physical reason is that at a phase transition
ﬁnite exchanges of heat are accompanied by inﬁnitesimal
changes of temperature, i.e., the speciﬁc heat diverges.
This is because at the transition point the energy intake
is not employed to heat up but rather to make the change
of phase.

For a second order phase transition, ﬁnite size scal-
ing predicts a peak in the speciﬁc heat whose height
and width scale respectively as ¯cK ∼ N α/(dν) and
δ ∼ N −1/(dν) [24], where d is the dimensionality of
the system, α and ν are the speciﬁc heat and the cor-
relation length critical exponents. Accordingly we pre-
dict the possibility of a boosted scaling of the perfmor-
mance Π ∼ N 1+α/(dν). But this is not the end of the
story. What about the scaling of the performance rate
˙Π = P/∆η = Wout/(T ∆η) = Π/T ? The cycle time T is
dominated by the thermalisation time [2], which, accord-
ing to ﬁnite size scaling theory scales with the dynamical
critical exponent z as Trelax ∼ N z/d [25] . Therefore, as
anticipated

˙Π ∼ N 1+(α−zν)/(dν) .

Critical-engine design. Let us see how a quantum Otto
engine can be designed to achieve such predicted per-
formance rate.
Imagine to have a substance described
by the Hamiltonian K, displaying, in the inﬁnite size
limit, a second order phase transition at the inverse criti-
cal temperature θC . Suppose your two baths have the
inverse temperatures β1, β2. Suppose you are able to
stretch/compress the spectrum of the working substance
and implement accordingly the time dependent Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (5) with λ(t) ∈ [λ1, λ2]. When λ takes on the
value λi, the critical temperature is accordingly rescaled
to βi
C = θC /λi. Now chose, e.g., λ1 so that β1 = β1
C
(that is chose λ1 = θC /β1
C ). In this way the tempera-
ture of the bath 1 coincides with the critical temperature
of H WS
1 = λ1K. You now chose λ2 as the solution of
Wout = N 1+z/d w, for some ﬁxed w. That would give
the corresponding eﬃciency η = 1 − λ2/λ1. Note that
since T ∼ N z/d, the power per constituent is ﬁxed: P =
Wout/T ∼ N . Now, since the slope of the graph W (∆η)
grows with the heat capacity as Π ∼ N 1+α/(dν), we have
∆η = Wout/Π ∼ N 1+z/d/N 1+α/(dν) ∼ N −(α−νz)/dν.
Hence if α − νz > 0 the solution λ2 gets accordingly
closer and closer to λ1β1/β2. Accordingly the eﬃciency
η = 1 − λ2/λ1 gets closer and closer to ηC = 1 − β1/β2.
As discussed in the caption of Fig.
3 what we have
just said is correct as long as the λ2 falls in the re-
gion of validity of the linear approximation (that is, in
graphical terms, if the corresponding ∆η falls in the re-
gion where the curve W (∆η) is well approximated by a
straight line passing through the origin). The extension
of that region corresponds to the width of the speciﬁc
heat peak, which as mentioned above universally scales as
δ ∼ N −1/(dν). So, in order to keep pace with the shrink-
ing of the linear approximation region, the approach to-
wards ∆η = 0 should be not slower than N −1/(dν). Since
that would occur at a pace of N −(α−νz)/(dν), the condi-
tion ensuring that it actually occurs is the stronger in-
equality (3). In Fig. 4 we illustrate how in such a case,
the engine design that we have described above actually
results in an asymptotic approach towards the Carnot

FIG. 4: Approach towards the Carnot point of a critical
working substance characterised by Eq. (3) at ﬁxed power
per constituent. Plots were calculated with critical indices
reported recently for Dy2Ti2O7, namely α ≃ 0.38 [21] and
zν ≃ −0.7 [19]. The value of ν was obtained from the rela-
tion ν = (2 − α)/d [26], and Carnot point was at ηC = 1/2.
The values employed for w, U0, U1, ∆U , see Eq. (??), are not
relevant. The inset shows the quantity ∂ ln ∆η/∂ ln N as a
function of N , that is the exponent characterising the ap-
proach to the Carnot point that reaches the expected value
−(α − zν)/(dν) ≃ −0.67

point, at ﬁxed power per constituent. In making Fig. 4
we have taken full advantage of one of the most strik-
ing aspects of our analysis, namely its universality. The
details of the speciﬁc model are not essential, all that
counts are the critical exponents. The speciﬁc heat peak
reads cK(θ) = N α/(dν)θ2U1∆U f (cid:0)∆U (θ − θC)N 1/(dν)(cid:1)
where f (x) is some bell shaped function (its exact
shape is not relevant). The according internal energy
of the working substance around the critical point reads
UK(θ) = U0 − N 1+(α−1)/(dν)U1F (cid:0)∆U (θ − θC )N 1/(dν)(cid:1) .
where F ′(x) = f (x). The plots are obtained by using
the latter with Eq. (6) to evaluate the work output, with
the choice f (x) = sech2(x), F (x) = tanh(x). The plot il-
lustrates the approach towards Carnot eﬃciency at ﬁxed
power per constituent, with the predicted scaling expo-
nent −(α − zν)/(dν).

Discussion. – The idea that phase transitions could en-
able the attainment of Carnot eﬃciency at ﬁnite power
was previously hinted by Polettini et al.
[5], but was
never pursued before. The present work conﬁrms that
intuition in fully ﬂedged way based on universality and
ﬁnite-size scaling theory and most importantly by ac-
counting for the ﬁrst time for the eﬀect of criticality on
the time of operation hence of the power.

As is clear from Fig. 3, independent on how the slope
dWout/d∆η|∆η=0 scales, it is Wout(∆η = 0) = 0, hence
exactly at the Carnot point all quantum Otto engines de-
liver null work hence null power. Our statement should
be accordingly understood in a weaker asymptotic sense,
namely, that it is possible to get as close as one wants

4

to the Carnot point without giving up power per con-
stituent. This is the viewpoint that also inspires Ref.
[2].

We remark that our linear condition ∆η ≪ 1 substan-
tially diﬀers from the condition of linear response regime
(i.e. β2 − β1 ≪ β2 or η ≪ 1) that was investigated previ-
ously in [1, 3–5]. In our case the two temperatures need
not be close to each other.

We stress that all obstacles hindering the realisation
of the critical powerful Carnot engines appear to be of
technological nature, rather than fundamental. One ma-
jor diﬃculty stems from the necessity of implementing
the Hamiltonian (5) containing a global coupling λ(t),
which can be very challenging in practice. Another dif-
ﬁculty stems from the fact that in order to be able to
asymptotically approach the Carnot point, one should
accordingly have an increasing degree of accuracy with
which λ1 and λ2 are controlled.

Lastly it is worth stressing that the result in Eq. (9)
holds in general as a consequence of the linear approxima-
tion valid for ∆η ≪ 1, and is accordingly not restricted to
the case of critical phenomena. This tells that one route
toward the improvement of the performance of a work-
ing substance is to increase its speciﬁc heat. That could
be achieved by increasing its number of constituents, a
possibility that we have investigated here, or by manip-
ulating any other parameter entering the Hamiltonian
K. Recently reported cases of improved performances
[27] can in fact be interpreted in terms of increased heat
capacity.
