Abstract. We study a discrete time random walk in an environment of i.i.d.
non-negative conductances in Zd. We consider the maximum displacements for
bridges, i.e. we condition the random walk on returning to the origin, and we prove
ﬁrst a normal (diﬀusive) behavior under some regularity assumptions: standard
heat kernel decay and polynomial volume growth. Afterwards, we prove that if
the heat kernel decay is such that the return probabilities are suﬃciently slow, we
obtain anomalous (subdiﬀusive) maximal displacements for bridges.

1. Introduction and statement of the results

We investigate the Random Conductance Model (RCM) with i.i.d. conductances
on the grid Zd. More precisely, let Ed be the set of non oriented nearest-neighbor
bonds, i.e. Ed = {e = {x, y} : x, y ∈ Zd,|x − y| = 1}. Let (ωe)e∈Ed be a family
of i.i.d. (non-negative) conductances deﬁned on a probability space (Ω, P). The
expectation with respect to P is denoted by E. We write ωe = ωxy = ω(x, y) and
x ∼ y if {x, y} ∈ Ed. For any realisation of the environment ω ∈ Ω, set

π(x) =

y:|x−y|=1

Pω(x, y) =

BOUKHADRA AND GANTERT

Let X = (Xn) be the Markov chain with state-space Zd and transition kernel
Pω(x, y) and let P x

ω denote the quenched law of X, started from x:

P x

ω (X0 = x) = 1

Let Pn

ω denote the n-th power of the transition kernel Pω, i.e.,

ω(x, y) = P x
Pn

ω (Xn = y).

(1.2)

(1.3)

X is then a random walk in the random environment ω. The heat kernel is given
by

pω
n(x, y) =

P x

ω (Xn = y)

π(y)

.

(1.4)

The continuous version of the random walk X or the constant speed random
walk (CSRW) on Zd, denoted by Y = (Yt, t ≥ 0, P x
ω , x ∈ Zd), is the continuous
time reversible random walk on Zd with jump probability Pω(x, y) and exponential
waiting time of rate 1 on each site x. We abuse notation slightly by writing P x
ω for
the law of Y . It is generated by

(Lωf )(x) :=

[f (y) − f (x)]Pω(x, y).

(1.5)

The annealed law associated to these processes is deﬁned by

(cid:88)
(cid:90)

y∼x

P =

ω dP(ω).
P o

Assume that P(ωe > 0) > pc(d) where pc(d) is the critical value for Bernoulli
bond percolation on Zd, and let C be the inﬁnite cluster where bonds are open if
they have positive conductances (see [18]). When P(ωe > 0) is suﬃciently close to
one, the set Zd \ C is a union of ﬁnite clusters.

Let o ∈ Zd denote the origin and deﬁne the conditional measure

Po(·) := P(· | o ∈ C ).

(1.6)

The RCM has been, in recent years, the subject of major research activity, see
Biskup [8] or Kumagai [19] for surveys. One of the essential questions was to
describe the consequences of the ﬂuctuations of the random environment on the as-
ymptotic behavior of the heat kernel. Mathieu and Remy [22] gave sharp results for
non-uniformly elliptic conductances, i.e random walks on super-critical percolation
clusters. They showed that

ω(Xt = y) ≤ c t−d/2
P o

sup

y

for some ﬁnite constant c. Barlow then improved this in [3].

The aim then was to prove the functional CLT. For the percolation model, we
refer to Sidoravicius and Sznitman [23], Berger and Biskup [6] and Mathieu and

Piatnitski [21]. For the general RCM, see Mathieu [20], Biskup and Prescott [11],
Barlow and Deuschel [4], Andres, Barlow, Deuschel and Hambly [1].
In Barlow
and Hambly [5] or more recently in [1] and [2], an invariance principle and a local
CLT have been proved, which has been extended for i.i.d. polynomial lower tail
conductances in the recent work of Boukhadra, Kumagai and Mathieu [14].

3

In parallel, anomalous behavior of the probability of return has been observed in
the sense that its decay was slower than the standard one, i.e. slower than n−d/2.
The reason for such behavior for a random walk among random conductances is the
trapping eﬀect of the holes (ﬁnite connected clusters of small conductances) in the
environment. The phenomenon was ﬁrst investigated for the case of annealed re-
turn probabilities in Fontes and Mathieu [16]. Then in [7], Berger, Biskup, Hoﬀman
and Kozma proved quenched anomalous decay for d ≥ 5 for heavy-tailed conduc-
tances. In fact, it is shown that the decay can be as slow as o(n−2). Afterwards, in
Boukhadra [12], [13], it has been shown that the transition from a classical decay
with rate n−d/2 to a slower decay happens in the class of power tail law of the
environment. Indeed, it is proved in [12] that, for an i.i.d. environment satisfying
P(ωe ∈ [0, 1]) = 1, P(ωe < u) = uγ(1 + o(1)) u → 0,
we have

for some γ > 0,

(1.7)

ω(X2n = o) ≥ C(ω) n−(2+δ),
P o

for some δ = δ(γ) −−→
γ→0

0 .

(1.8)

In the special case of dimension d = 4, Biskup and Boukhadra [9] give an answer as
follows: for any positive sequence λn ↑ ∞, there exists an i.i.d. environment with
heavy-tailed conductances near zero such that

ω(X2n = 0) ≥ C(ω)
P 0

log n
λnn2 ,

along a deterministic sequence (nk) with C(ω) > 0 almost surely.

In this paper, we study the magnitude of the maximal displacement maxk≤2n |Xk|
ω , conditioned on the event {X2n = o}. The
for the RCM under the quenched law P x
result that mainly motivated our work is Gantert and Peterson [17] where the same
question was studied for one dimensional non-symmetric random walk in a random
environment (RWRE) satisfying an ellipticity condition. They showed that if the
environment is such that both positive and negative local drifts exist then the
maximal displacement conditioned on returning to the origin at time 2n is of order
nκ/(κ+1), where the constant κ > 0 depends on the law of the environment. On
the other hand, if the environment is such that only non-negative local drifts exist
then the maximal displacement conditioned on returning to the origin at time 2n
is at least n1−ε and at most n/(log n)2−ε for any ε > 0. We were also motivated
by the work of M. Biskup et al. [10], in which they consider the same RCM on Zd

4

BOUKHADRA AND GANTERT

with i.i.d. random conductances in [0, 1] and show that in the situations when the
random walk conditioned to return back to the starting point at time 2n and the
heat kernel exhibits subdiﬀusive decay — which is known to occur in dimensions
d ≥ 4 — the walk gets trapped for a time of order n in a small spatial region.

The return probability decay of the simple random walk is of order n−d/2 while
for the RCM, it depends on the environment law P. In fact, the reason for a slower
decay of the return probabilities of a random walk among random conductances is
the trapping eﬀect of the holes in the environment.
For our main results, we ﬁrst need some assumptions. Write Bn = [−n, n]d ∩ Zd.

Assumption 1.1 (i) There exist c1 > 0 and N0 > 0 such that
n, n ≥ N0.

n(x, y) ≤ c1n−d/2

Remark 1.3 (1) If we suppose that the conductances are uniformly elliptic, i.e.

∃c > 0 such that P(c−1 ≤ ωe ≤ c) = 1,

then condition (ii) of Assumption 1.1 is clearly satisﬁed and (i) is satisﬁed as well,
see [15], hence Theorem 1.2 applies.

(2) Another important example where Assumption 1.1, (i), (ii) are satisﬁed is the
RCM with i.i.d. polynomial lower tail conductances satisfying (1.7). From [14], for

Our next results show that when the standard heat kernel upper bounds fail,
ω (o, o) is suﬃciently slow, we may have

state the following general results.

Obviously, one may ask about d = 2, 3 and 4. As for d = 2 or 3, from [7,
Theorem 2.1], the heat kernel decay is standard, hence the bridges behave always
in a normal way. For d = 4, the question is open, and we hope to address it in
future work.

There are at least two examples for the anomalous maximum displacements of
bridges. In the ﬁrst place, there is the i.i.d. environment in [7, Theorem 2.2] for
which it was shown that for d ≥ 5 and κ > 1/d,

In this model, the conductances are heavy-tailed in the sense that they follow a
probability law that satisﬁes

P(ωe < u) =(cid:12)(cid:12) log u(cid:12)(cid:12)−θ(1 + o(1)),

with θ > 0.

In the second place, there is the model (1.7) with i.i.d. polynomial lower tail
conductances with the lower estimates (1.8). This model is interesting because
we see in this model the transition, from standard behavior of the heat kernel to
anomalous one.
Corollary 1.5 Let d ≥ 5. Let X be the discrete-time random walk in a random
environment governed by a family of i.i.d. conductances (ωe) such that
u → 0,

(LP)
where γ > 0 is a parameter. Let α ∈ (0, 1/2). Then there is a positive constant cd,
depending only on d, such that if γ satisﬁes

P(ωe ∈ [0, 1]) = 1; P(ωe < u) = uγ(1 + o(1)),

we have

Remark 1.6 From the proof of Theorem 1.5, we have to choose γ such that

δ(γ) < (d/2 − 2)α−

(1.16)

where δ(γ) is given in (1.8) and α− < α. From Boukhadra [12], we have that (1.8)
holds true with

δ(γ) = σ 2d(2d − 1)γ,

where σ > 1 can be chosen arbitrarily. Then Corollary 1.5 applies if we choose

d − 4

The question is, what is the optimal choice of cd ? The recent work of Boukhadra,
Kumagai and Mathieu [14] leads us to conjecture that it should be

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we provide
the proof of Theorem 1.2. This uses an argument based on exit time estimates
and return probabilities. Then Section 3 contains the proof of Theorem 1.4 and
Corollary 1.5, which consists mainly in observing the random walk X on an inﬁnite
connected cluster of conductances larger than some chosen constant, that is, the so
called coarse-grained walk.

In the following, we use c or C as generic constants that may change from line

to line.

2. The Standard behavior

This section contains the proof of Theorem 1.2. Henceforth, we let d ≥ 2 and
assume that the conductances {ωe, e ∈ Ed} are i.i.d. random variables and ωe ≥ 0
with P(ωe > 0) > pc(d).

First we need some exit time estimates. Recall Y the CSRW. Set

τBr = inf{n ≥ 0 : Xn /∈ Br};

Br = inf{t ≥ 0 : Yt /∈ Br}.
τ Y
The following lemma is a discrete time version of [1, Proposition 4.7].
Lemma 2.1 There exist Po-a.s. constants c1, c2, c3 such that for r large enough
and n larger than r/2,

ω(τBr ≤ n) ≤ c1 e−c2r2/n + e−c3n.

Since Sn is a sum of n independent exponential distributions of rate 1, by Cramer’s
Theorem, we have for n large enough,

ω(Sn > 2n) ≤ e−cn.
P o

On the other hand, for r large enough and n larger than r/2, [1, Proposition 4.7]
gives

ω(τ Y

r ≤ 2n) ≤ e−cr2/n

Use these in (2.4) and the claim follows.

Now we consider the expected time spent by the random walk in a box Br.

3. The anomalous behavior

In this section we provide the proof of Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.5. So let
d ≥ 5 and assume that the conductances {ωe, e ∈ Ed} are i.i.d. random variables
and ωe ∈ [0, 1] with P(ωe > 0) > pc(d) where pc(d) is the critical value for Bernoulli
bond percolation on Zd (see [18] for the deﬁnition).

We start with the proof of the corollary since it is a direct consequence of Theo-

rem 1.4.

Proof of Corollary 1.5. From Boukhadra [12], we have that (1.8) holds true for

δ = δ(γ) = σ 2d(2d − 1)γ,

for an arbitrarily chosen value of σ > 1. Then

λn = nd/2 P 2n

ω (o, o) ≥ nd/2−(2+δ).

Now let α < 1/2 and choose γ > 0 such that
d − 4

4d(2d − 1)
Then we can ﬁnd α− < α and σ > 1 such that

γ <

α.

δ < (d/2 − 2)α−,

which by Theorem 1.4 gives the result since

n(d/2−2)(1−α−)/λn −→ 0 when n → ∞.

(cid:3)
Now we return to Theorem 1.4. Pick a ξ > 0 such that P(ωe ≥ ξ) > pc(d). There
exists then almost surely a unique inﬁnite cluster of conductances larger than ξ
that we denote by Cξ (see [18]).
First, we recall that when ξ is small enough, the components of Zd \ Cξ are ﬁnite
a.s. and in a box of radius n, they have logarithmic size. More precisely, let x ∈ Zd
and let Hx be the (possibly empty) set of sites in the ﬁnite component of Zd \ Cξ
containing x.

10

BOUKHADRA AND GANTERT

Lemma 3.1 Let d ≥ 2. For p = P(ωe ≥ ξ) suﬃciently close to 1, there exist
constants C < ∞ and c > 0 such that for all n ≥ 1

P(diam H0 > n) ≤ C e−cn.

Here “ diam” is the diameter in the | · |∞−distance on Zd.
Proof. See Lemma 3.1 in [11].

(cid:3)

Deﬁne the conditional measure

Pξ(·) := P(· | o ∈ Cξ)

(3.1)
To measure the time that the walk X spends away from Cξ, set T0 := 0 and

deﬁne

T(cid:96)+1 := inf{n > T0 + . . . + T(cid:96) : Xn ∈ Cξ},

(3.2)
Recall that by Lemma 3.1, all components of Zd\Cξ are ﬁnite a.s., and then T(cid:96) < ∞
a.s. for all (cid:96). The times T(cid:96) are the times when the walk X visits Cξ. These visits
occur at the locations

(cid:96) ≥ 1.

Then the sequence (X ξ

n) is a Markov chain on Cξ with transition kernel given by

X ξ

(cid:96) := XT0+···+T(cid:96).

(3.3)

(3.4)
We easily check that the restriction of the measure π to Cξ is invariant and reversible
for the Markov chain on Cξ induced by Pξ.

ω (XT1 = y).

Pξ(x, y) := P x

We need the following fact that is Proposition 3.5 in [7].

every (cid:96) ≥ 1 and every n ≥ 1

Next we also need the following observation. Deﬁne

(3.6)

Lemma 3.3 Let n ∈ N and θ ≥ 0. Then the following sequence is decreasing

m (cid:55)−→ P o

ω(X2m = o | (cid:96)n ≥ θ).

Proof. The Markov chain X conditioned on {(cid:96)n ≥ θ} still remains a Markov chain,
(cid:3)
and [7, Lemma 3.9] gives the results.

Now we are ﬁnally ready to conclude our argumentation.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let α ∈ (0, 1/2) and α− ∈ (0, α). Note ﬁrst that by virtue
of Lemma 3.1 and the Borel-Cantelli lemma, there exists a ﬁnite random variable
N = N (ω) such that for n ≥ N , for every x ∈ Bn,

11

(since the “jumps” are at most of logarithmic size, if (cid:96)n < nα−, the walk can not
be more than distance nα away from the origin). This implies that

ω((cid:96)n ≥ nα− | X2n = o).

Ti = 2m, X ξ

.

(3.11)

By Lemma 3.2, the (cid:96)-th term on the right hand side is less than C(ω)n−1(cid:96)1−d/2.
Then we obtain

Hence, for n large enough and when X0 = 0,

Now set θ = (cid:98)nα−(cid:99) and observe that for m ≤ n, we have

ω((cid:96)2m ≥ θ, X2m = o) ≥ n(cid:88)

P o

ω((cid:96)n ≥ θ, X2m = o),
P o

m=n/2

m=n/2

which by Lemma 3.3, is larger than

ω((cid:96)n ≥ θ, X2n = o)
P o

n
2

Thus, thanks to (3.12),

ω((cid:96)n ≥ θ, X2n = o) ≤ cn−2+(2−d/2)α−,
P o

Putting this in (3.9), the claim follows.
