Abstract—Simultaneous wireless information and power trans-
fer (SWIPT) is an appealing research area because both infor-
mation and energy can be delivered to wireless devices simul-
taneously. In this paper, we propose a diplexer-based receiver
architecture that can utilizes both the doubling frequency and
baseband signals after the mixer. The baseband signals are used
for information decoding and the doubling frequency signals are
converted to direct current for energy harvesting. We analyze
the signal in the receiver and ﬁnd that the power of the energy
harvested is equal to that of information decoded. Therefore,
the diplexer can be used as a power splitter with a power
splitting factor of 0.5. Speciﬁcally, we consider a multiuser
multi-input single-output (MISO) system, in which each user
is equipped with the newly proposed receiver. The problem is
formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the total
transmitted power subject to some constraints on each user’s
quality of service and energy harvesting demand. We show
that the problem thus formulated is a non-convex quadratically
constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which can be solved by
semi-deﬁnite relaxation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer has become an attractive research area because it
utilizes radio frequency (RF) signals both transferring in-
formation and delivering energy. The idea of SWIPT was
ﬁrst proposed in [1] and later the work is extended to
frequency-selective channels with additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) in [2]. The receiver is assumed to be able
to decode information and harvest energy at the same time.
However, the practical receiver circuit cannot meet the as-
sumption as circuits for harvesting energy from RF signals
cannot decode the carried information directly. Thus, [3] and
[4] proposed two practical schemes, namely power splitting
(PS) and time switching (TS), respectively. The PS scheme
divides the received signal into two parts according to an
alterable PS factor, with one used for energy harvesting (EH)
and the other one used for information decoding (ID). For the
TS scheme, the receiver operates on the EH or ID mode at
one time and the TS scheme can be considered a special case
of the PS scheme with a PS factor of 0 or 1.

The traditional receiver removes the high frequency (HF)
component after the mixer using low-pass ﬁlters, and reserves
the baseband component for information decoding. In this

paper, we propose a new receiver architecture equipped with
a diplexer, which can utilize both the baseband component
and the HF component simultaneously. In this newly proposed
receiver, the HF component that should have been removed in
traditional receivers can be transformed into direct current to
charge the battery. The diplexer is used after the mixer in the
RF chain to split the mixed doubling frequency and baseband
signals. In this way, both HF and baseband signal components
can be utilized to achieve SWIPT.

With the diplexer-based receiver, we study a downlink
multiuser MISO system that aims to minimize the transmitted
power subject to the demands of ID and EH at the receivers.
SWIPT has been recently studied in literature, i.e., [5], [7],
[8], [10]. A multi-casting system was studied in [8], where
the transmitter sends the same information to all users. In [7],
the transmitter employs a linear precoding scheme to deliver
information to different users, which use PS schemes and
single user detection at the receivers. This paper optimizes
both the beamforming and PS factors to minimize the total
transmitted power subject to the individual quality-of-service
(QoS) and EH thresholds. Coincidentally, [5] studied the same
problem but with more mathematical analysis. In addition, the
security problem in SWIPT MISO systems was studied in [10],
which aims to minimize the total transmit power subject to
some constraints on the secrecy rate and energy harvested at
each receiver.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
1) We propose a diplexer-based receiver architecture to
achieve SWIPT. This receiver can utilize the HF component
that should have been wasted previously. The PS factor of the
receiver is a constant number 0.5.

2) A downlink multiuser MISO system with each user
equipped with the diplexer-based receiver is investigated. The
objective is to minimize the total transmitted power subject
to constraints on each user’s quality of service and energy
harvesting demand. The problem thus formulated is a quadrat-
ically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and can be
solved by SDP relaxation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the receiver architecture and the system model.
Section III formulates the problem of interest. Section IV
solves the problem of minimizing the total transmit power via
SDP relaxation. Section V provides simulation results, and
section VI concludes the paper.

frequency fc is expressed as S(t) =(cid:112)2Pavg(cid:60){m(t)ej2πfct},

As shown in Fig. 1, we ﬁrst study a point-to-point wireless
communication system where both the transmitter and the re-
ceiver are equipped with only one antenna. The received signal
is denoted as r(t). The complex baseband message signal
at the transmitter is denoted as m(t), whose amplitude and
phase are real signals a(t) and b(t), respectively, i.e., m(t) =
a(t)ejb(t). The average power of m(t) is normalized as
E{a2(t)} = 1, where E{.} denotes mathematical expectation.
Then, the transmitted RF bandpass signal S(t) with carrier
where (cid:60){.} and Pavg denote the real part of a complex
number and the average transmit power of S(t), respectively.
The constant
2 plays a role in keeping the power of S(t)
consistent with m(t). Without loss of generality, we assume
that the bandwidth of S(t) is B Hz, which is much lower than
fc, i.e., B (cid:28) fc.
Aejφ,
where A(A > 0) and φ ∈ [0, 2π) denote the channel
power gain and phase shift, respectively. The additive noise
nA(t) at the receiver is a bandpass narrow-band gaussian

signal and is expressed as nA(t) =
where nAl(t) = nI (t) + jnQt with nI (t) and nQ(t) denote
the in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively.
nI (t) and nQ(t) are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
Gaussian random variables (RVs) with zero mean and variance
A/2. Due to the independence of nI (t) and nQ(t), the power
σ2
of nAl(t) can be easily shown to be σ2
A. Thus, nAl(t) is a
complex Gaussian RV with zero mean and variance σ2
A, i.e.,
nAl(t) ∼ CN (0, σ2
A).

where real signals c(t) and d(t) denote the amplitude and
phase of nAl(t), respectively, i.e., nAl(t) = c(t)ejd(t), φ =
−2πfcτ is the phase shift caused by the propagation delay.

B. Receiver Architecture

There are baseband and doubling frequency signal compo-
nents at the mixer output of a coherent receiver. The traditional

2

receiver removes the HF component after the mixer using
low-pass ﬁlters, and reserves the baseband component for
information decoding. In this paper, we propose a new receiver
architecture equipped with a diplexer, which can utilize both
the baseband component and the HF component simultane-
ously. In this proposed receiver, the HF component that should
have been removed in traditional receivers can be transformed
into direct current to charge the battery. The diplexer is used
after the mixer in the RF chain to split the mixed doubling
frequency and baseband signals. In this way, both HF and
baseband signal components can be utilized to achieve SWIPT.
Diplexer is a RF device used in many electronic products [15].
It is a three-port network that splits incoming signals from a
common port into two paths (baseband path and HF path)
based on their frequency differences.

The proposed receiver architecture is shown in Fig. 2.
Compared to a conventional ID receiver, we mainly replace the
low-pass ﬁlters (LPF) with diplexers [3]. We assume that the
receiver knows the phase shift φ of the channel perfectly and
it adopts coherent demodulation to demodulate the received
signal. From r(t), local oscillation signals cos(2πfct + φ)
and sin(2πfct + φ), two real signals g1(t) and g2(t) are
generated at the mixer output, and they are both composed
of baseband and doubling frequency components. Deﬁne
g1(t) (cid:44) r1(t) + r2(t) and g2(t) (cid:44) r3(t) + r4(t) with r1(t),
r3(t) denoting the corresponding baseband components and
r2(t), r4(t) denoting the corresponding doubling frequency
components, respectively. It is clear that r1(t) and r3(t) are the
in-phase and quadrature components of r(t). We can recover
rl(t) = r1(t) + j ∗ r3(t) for ID, where rl(t) is the equivalent
lowpass signal of r(t). The remaining HF signal component
H(t) (cid:44) r2(t) + r4(t) is used to charge the energy storage for
EH. It is worth noting that this HF component is not used for
EH in conventional SWIPT receivers.

Based on (1) and the standard trigonometric identities, g1(t)

and g2(t) are rewritten as

g1(t) =

L(t) = −(cid:112)APavga(t)sin(θ1 − π/4) − c(t)sin(θ2 − π/4)
H(t) =(cid:112)APavga(t)sin(θ3 + π/4) + c(t)sin(θ4 + π/4)

are found as

Remark: The newly proposed receiver is able to utilize both
the baseband component and the HF component simultane-
ously. In the proposed receiver, the HF component that should
have been removed in traditional receivers can be transformed
into direct current to charge the battery for EH.
As a result, the rectiﬁer circuit can make full use of the
power of H(t) for EH. Letting η (0 < η ≤ 1) denote the
rectiﬁer coefﬁcient and ignoring the power of additive noise,
the average power of harvested energy Q is given by

Now, we apply the diplexer-based receiver into a downlink
MISO system shown in Fig. 3, where there are one transmitter
and multiple users. The transmitter is equipped with N (N >
1) antennas while K (K ≥ 1) users each has one antenna.
The transmitter aims to transmit dedicated information to
different users and the users employ the proposed receiver
architecture to receive information and energy simultaneously.
Without loss of generality, we assume that all the channels
are subject to frequency non-selective block Rayleigh fading.

III. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM

In this section, we consider an optimization problem that
focuses on the beamformings design, aiming to minimize the
total transmitted power subject to each user’s EH and QoS
constraints. The optimization problem P0 is formulated as

where ξk is deﬁned as ξk (cid:44) 2µk/η and can be regarded as a
new EH threshold. Dropping the rank constraint, we have P2:

where SIN Rk and Qk are given in (14) and (15). γk and
µk denote the SINR and EH threshold of the kth user,
respectively.

A. Feasibility Test

the SINR thresholds satisfying (cid:80)K

We now check the feasibility of P0. Once the SINR
constraint is satisﬁed, we can always ﬁnd an ampliﬁcation
factor and multiply it with the beamforming vector to satisfy
the EH constraint. Therefore, if the SINR constraint is met,
P0 will be feasible. It follows from [6] that if and only if
γk+1 ≤ rank(H), P0
with only SINR constraints is feasible, where H is deﬁned as
H (cid:44) [h1 h2 . . . hK]. We assume that P0 is feasible in the
remaining sections.

k=1

γk

B. Convexity analysis

Next, we analyze the convexity of P0. The SINR constraint
is convex since it can be converted to second-ordered cone
restrictive conditions as shown in [9]. The EH constraint is
non-convex since it can be seen as the sum of concave func-
tions. Therefore, P0 is non-convex and belongs to the class
of non-convex QCQP problems. Without loss of generality,
we use semideﬁnite programming (SDP) relaxtion method to
approach the optimal solutions.

IV. SDP RELAXATION

We ﬁrst introduce the new matrixes Wj = ωjωH

j and Hj =
j . Recall that the inner product of two hermitian matrixes
hjhH
A and B is Tr(AB) and xH Ax = Tr(AxxH ). Thus, we can
convert P0 to P1:

P4 is a standard SDP problem can be solved using a SDP
solver (i.e., CVX [14]). If {Wj} are rank-one, then the optimal
solutions of the original problem can be derived directly from
them, i.e. eigenvalue decomposition (EVD).

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, we provide numerical results to evaluate
the transmit beamforming scheme. The simulation scenario
assumes that the transmitter is equipped with four antennas,
each of which is used for a user, i.e., K = N = 4. All
channels are Rayleigh fading and their pathlosses are assumed
to be −40 dB. All users have the same thresholds on the QoS
A is −70 dBm and
and energy harvested. The additive noise σ2
cov is −50 dBm. The EH conversion is
the conversion noise σ2
assumed perfect.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a diplexer-based receiver to utilize the
HF signal component that should have been wasted previously.
The new receiver architecture has a PS factor of 0.5. We deploy
the new receiver into a MISO system, which aims to minimize
the transmitted power subject to constraints on individual QoS
and EH demands. The non-convex problem thus formulated
can be solved using SDP relaxation.

Fig. 4: Transmission power VS EH threshold ξ

Fig. 5: Transmission power VS SINR threshold γ

In Fig. 4, we investigate the minimum transmission power
versus the EH threshold ξ with the SINR threshold γ being
ﬁxed. For γ = 2, we can see that the transmitted power does
not change as ξ increases in the former part of the curve. This
is because when the value of ξ is small, the SINR constraint is
tighter than the EH constraint and the SINR constraint mainly
determines the transmitted power. When ξ becomes larger,
we need more transmission power to cover the EH demand.
For γ = 1, the SINR request is low and the EH constraint
dominates the amount of the transmitted power. In Fig. 5,
we study how the SINR threshold affect on the minimum
transmission power with the EH threshold ξ being ﬁxed. It
can be seen that more energy is needed to satisfy the tighter
SINR constraints.
