ABSTRACT

Aims. We present for the ﬁrst time Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry images of the radio galaxy Cygnus A at the frequency of 86
GHz. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of only ∼200 Schwarzschild radii (RS), such observations provide an extremely detailed
view of the nuclear regions in this archetypal object and allow us to derive important constraints for theoretical models describing the
launching of relativistic jets.
Methods. A pixel-based analysis of the jet outﬂow, which still appears two-sided on the scales probed, was performed. By ﬁtting
Gaussian functions to the transverse intensity proﬁles, we could determine the jet width in the nuclear region.
Results. The base of the jets appears wide. The minimum measured transverse width of ∼(227 ± 98) RS is signiﬁcantly larger than
the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit, suggesting that the outer accretion disk is contributing to the jet launching. The
existence of a faster and Doppler de-boosted inner section, powered either from the rotation of the inner regions of the accretion disk
or by the spinning black hole, is suggested by the kinematic properties and by the observed limb brightening of the ﬂow.

1. Introduction

The launching mechanism of relativistic extragalactic jets is a
much debated and crucial topic for understanding these fascinat-
ing objects. There is currently a broad consensus on the funda-
mental role that the strong magnetic ﬁelds anchored in the accre-
tion disk play in the process. However, to fully reproduce the ob-
served properties of such magnetically-driven jets, e.g. Lorentz
factors as high as ∼50 and opening angles as small as half a de-
gree, is still a challenge for theorists. General relativistic MHD
simulations (e.g. Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011) have shown that
highly collimated, relativistic jets can be eﬃciently powered by
the black hole’s rotational energy extracted through the magnetic
ﬁeld, as described in the work of Blandford & Znajek (1977).
This scenario is supported by a recent observational study of a
large sample of blazars (Ghisellini et al. 2014), indicating that
the contribution of a spinning black hole is necessary to account
for the estimated jet powers. Alternatively, the rotation of the
accretion disk has been proposed as a viable power source for
magnetic jet launching (Blandford & Payne 1982). Predictions
for the terminal Lorentz factor of such disk winds are diverse,
with values ranging from mildly relativistic (Γ < 3, McKinney
& Gammie 2004; De Villiers et al. 2005) to relativistic (Γ ∼ 10,
Komissarov et al. 2007).

A fundamental tool for discriminating between the two
launching mechanisms is the direct imaging of the jet base
through VLBI observations and the determination of its trans-
verse size. This kind of study has been rarely performed because
the jet base is usually not resolved. Moreover, owing to syn-
chrotron opacity eﬀects (Königl 1981), the location of the VLBI
core is often shifted at large distances, ∼104−106 Schwarzschild
radii (RS), from the black hole (e.g. Marscher et al. 2008). One

exception is M 87, for which a distance of only 14-23 RS has
been inferred for the 43 GHz core (Hada et al. 2011). In the same
source, VLBI pilot studies at 1.3 mm (with the Event Horizon
Telescope) have determined a core size of ∼ 5.5 RS (Doeleman
et al. 2012), which represents an upper limit for the true size of
the jet apex. This important measurement indicates that the jet
of M 87 is likely anchored close to the Innermost Stable Circular
Orbit (ISCO). Performing such an analysis in other sources is
clearly fundamental for testing the variety of possible scenarios.
However, while future instruments with improved capabilities
(e.g. phased ALMA) will certainly enrich the sample of suitable
targets, this is currently quite limited.

In this letter we present, for the ﬁrst time, a detailed imaging
of the jet base in Cygnus A through Global VLBI observations
at 86 GHz (GMVA). Among the powerful FR II radio galax-
ies, Cygnus A is one of the very few two-sided sources whose
jet launching region can be probed with suﬃcient sensitivity at
high radio frequencies. At the source redshift (z=0.056)1 and
assuming a black hole mass of 2.5 × 109M(cid:12) (Tadhunter et al.
2003), GMVA observations allow scales of the order of 102 RS
to be probed. The large jet viewing angle enables a prominent
counter-jet to be detected in this source, which represents a fun-
damental advantage when investigating the nuclear regions of a
jet. In fact, since the transverse width can be determined continu-
ously along the two-sided ﬂow, the assumption-dependent back-
extrapolations of the properties of the jet apex can be replaced
by actual measurements.

The following analysis complements a previous VLBI study
at 43 GHz of the jet transverse proﬁle and of the kinematic prop-

erties (Boccardi et al. 2016, hereafter B1). This revealed the pres-
ence of a pronounced transverse stratiﬁcation, both in ﬂux den-
sity (limb brightening) and bulk Lorentz factor (1 (cid:46) Γ (cid:46) 2.5),
typical of a ﬂow with spine-sheath structure.

2. Observations and VLBI images
The GMVA data set comprises three epochs from observations
in 2009/2010 with a cadence between ﬁve and seven months
(Table 1). The duration of the observations was 15-16 hours,
∼8 of which were spent on Cygnus A. This, together with the
large number of antennas employed and with the favourable dec-
lination of the source, enabled good uv-coverage. Data were
recorded in single polarization mode with a recording rate of
512 Mb/s, which corresponds to an observing bandwidth of
128 MHz. The correlation took place at the MPIfR in Bonn,
Germany. The data reduction was carried out in AIPS (Greisen
1990). Aside from the standard calibration procedures, special
care was devoted during the fringe ﬁtting. First, as described in
Martí-Vidal et al. (2012), the manual phase calibration was ap-
plied. Single sub-band phases and delays were calculated using
one or more scans showing strong detections from the calibra-
tor J2015+3710. Then, the global fringe ﬁtting was performed
(Schwab & Cotton 1983). The amplitude calibration was based
on the measured system temperatures and gain curves at each
telescope, and it included a correction for atmospheric opacity.
The imaging and self-calibration of amplitude and phase
were performed in DIFMAP (Shepherd et al. 1994). The ﬁnal
clean maps obtained are presented in Fig. 1. The nuclear re-
gion is detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio S/N (between
∼1200-2000), with the brightest feature – which we refer to as
the “core” – showing a prominent variability over the monitoring
period. The total ﬂux density varies between ∼0.65 and 1 Jy and
is consistent with the measurement of ∼1 Jy provided by 86 GHz
single-dish observations at IRAM (Agudo et al. 2010). The am-
plitude variation during the self-calibration procedure was not
greater than ∼30%, thus this percentage can be assumed as the
uncertainty associated with the ﬂux density measurements.

A visual inspection of the maps already shows the high mor-
phological complexity of Cygnus A at this frequency and at this
angular resolution. A prominent counter-jet is detected in all
three epochs. The jet emission is relatively smooth – i.e. there
are no bright features besides the core – but at the same time
rich with sub-structures. It can also be noticed that, due to the
low S/N in the faintest regions, the emission is not detected over
the full jet cross-section in a single epoch. The jet structure can

be recovered much better after stacking the three maps, as shown
in Fig. 2. In this image, characterized by a reduced noise level
of ∼0.1 mJy/beam, the jet limb brightening already observed at
43 GHz also appears to be better deﬁned, especially in the outer
and faintest regions of the approaching jet.

3. Analysis and discussion
3.1. Transverse width proﬁle
The analysis of the jet transverse structure in Cygnus A was ﬁrst
presented at the frequency of 43 GHz in B1. In this study it was
shown that the ﬂow emanates parabolically from the position of
an emission gap located at ∼0.2 mas east of the brightest feature.
A measurement of the jet transverse width was also provided for
the nuclear region. However, the minimum size of ∼30 µas oc-
curring in the vicinity of the faint emission gap was about seven
times smaller than the beam size in the transverse direction. In
this letter we exploit the improved resolution achieved by GMVA
observations for obtaining a more solid estimate of the transverse
width at the base of the ﬂow. Given the better quality and the re-
duced noise level of the stacked image as compared to the single
epochs, we focus our analysis on the former. The stacked image
was restored with a circular beam of 0.1 mas, which is approx-
imately the natural resolution in the transverse direction (Table
1). Then, it was sliced pixel by pixel (1px=0.02 mas) along the
jet axis using the AIPS task SLICE. The transverse intensity dis-
tribution in each slice was ﬁnally ﬁtted with a single Gaussian
proﬁle using the task SLFIT.
Figure 3 shows the dependence of the de-convolved jet width
on the distance from the core z in the central ∼1.5 mas of the

source. The distance z, also expressed in RS, was de-projected as-
suming a viewing angle θ = 74.5◦ (as calculated in B1). The er-
ror bars are conservatively assumed equal to one ﬁfth of the mea-
sured FWHM. The minimum jet width dmin occurs for z = −0.02
mas, where the measured transverse size is dmin = (51 ± 22)
µas. This corresponds to about half of the nominal resolution in
the transverse direction. However, as discussed by several au-
thors (e.g. Fomalont 1989; Lobanov 2005; Kovalev et al. 2005),
the limiting resolution of a certain brightness distribution mainly
depends on the S/N of the detection. Following Lobanov (2005),
the resolution limit dlim for the case of a Gaussian proﬁle ﬁtted
to a brightness distribution with uniform weighting is

where S p is the peak ﬂux density of the transverse intensity pro-
ﬁle, σ is the rms noise of the map and b the equivalent circular
beam (for uniform weighting) expressed as a function of the ma-

jor and minor beam axes, bmaj and bmin, as b = (cid:112)bmaj · bmin.

The value of dlim was calculated for each slice, and its proﬁle
as a function of z is also reported in Fig. 3. Except for a faint
area in the counter-jet (z ∼ −0.5 mas), the measured width is
everywhere well above the resolution limit, therefore the jet is
resolved in the nuclear region.

3.2. Minimum width and implications for the jet launching
The minimum jet width dmin = (51±22) µas measured at 86 GHz
translates into a linear size of ∼ (227 ± 98) RS. Unlike the case
of M 87 (Doeleman et al. 2012), the jet apex appears to be much
wider than the ISCO radius, which varies between 1 and 9 RS
depending on the BH spin and on the kind of orbit (prograde or
retrograde) of the BH/accretion disk system. These results sug-
gest that at least part of the jet base in Cygnus A is anchored at
large disk radii from the central BH, i.e. the outer regions of the
accretion disk are involved in the jet launching process. Based
on the sub-parsec scale kinematic study presented in B1, we in-
fer that such a disk wind is characterized by mildly relativistic
speeds, with the bulk Lorentz factor varying from Γ ∼ 1 at the
jet edge to Γ ∼ 2.5 in sections of the ﬂow closer to the jet axis.

Fig. 3. Transverse width proﬁle at 86 GHz for the stacked image. Error
bars for the width measurements (green points with label dmeas) are as-
sumed equal to 1/5 of each convolved FWHM. The dashed black line
with label dlim indicates the proﬁle of the resolution limit.

We point out, however, that our width measurement does not
exclude the existence of both a narrower and an even broader
component. Concerning the former, it should be recalled that in
jets seen at large viewing angles Doppler de-boosting aﬀects not
only the receding side but also the approaching one. For suf-
ﬁciently high speeds, the Doppler factor can be much smaller
than one, so that the ﬂow is completely invisible. In the case of
Cygnus A, the gradual fading of the accelerating inner-jet com-
ponents was directly observed in our kinematic analysis. This,
together with the observed limb brightening, strongly indicate
that an invisible faster ﬂow exists in the central body of the jet.
This spine may be driven either from the rotation of the inner
regions of the accretion disk or by the spinning black hole itself.
A hypothetical broader and diﬀuse disk wind, instead, is likely
resolved out in these high resolution images. Indeed VLBI ob-
servations at 5 GHz (Carilli et al. 1991) support the existence of
such a component. At this frequency, the jet appears as an al-
most cylindrical resolved ﬂow with transverse width between 2
and 2.2 mas, i.e. of the order of 9000 RS. Although this large
size may partially be the eﬀect of scattering in the interstellar

medium, there is an indication that the jet base extends to much
larger disk radii than measured at 86 GHz.

3.3. Comparison with results at 43 GHz

The discussion in the previous section has not quite addressed
the problem of truly locating the central engine in Cygnus A.
Given the roughly symmetric expansion of jet and counter-jet
shown in Fig. 3, the most natural interpretation would be that
the supermassive black hole is located in the vicinity of z ∼ 0.
However, although the jet base is assumed to be the narrowest
part of the jet in the simplest models, this may not necessarily
be the case. An interesting argument comes from the compar-
ison of the 86 GHz width proﬁle with results at 43 GHz. For
the purposes of the comparison, the analysis was repeated at the
two frequencies following the method described in Sect. 3.1 after
convolving the maps with the same circular beam of 0.15 mas.
Results are presented in Fig. 4. We ﬁrst notice that the dip in the

4. Conclusions
We have presented the ﬁrst VLBI images of the radio galaxy
Cygnus A at the frequency of 86 GHz. The enhanced spatial res-
olution of these maps allowed us to investigate the transverse
width proﬁle at the onset of the two-sided ﬂow. The jet base
appears wide with a minimum width of ∼(227 ± 98) RS. This
value is much higher than the ISCO radius, thus we infer that
the emission is produced by a mildly relativistic, parabolically
expanding disk wind. The existence of a central and faster jet,
possibly driven by the black hole and invisible due to Doppler
de-boosting, is however not excluded. It is, on the contrary, sug-
gested by the kinematic properties and by the observed limb
brightening of the ﬂow. In the hypothesis that the Blandford &
Znajek (1977) and Blandford & Payne (1982) mechanisms act
simultaneously in relativistic jets, giving rise to a spine-sheath
structure of the ﬂow (e.g. Hardee et al. 2007; Xie et al. 2012), we
indeed expect the slower disk wind to always dominate the emis-
sion in radio galaxies and the BH-driven jet to be the main ob-
servable component in blazars due to diﬀerential boosting. The
comparison of the width proﬁles at 43 and 86 GHz indicates that
free-free opacity and/or synchrotron opacity are still strong at
43 GHz but not at 86 GHz. Observing at high radio frequencies
is therefore fundamental for unveiling the physical properties of
jets at their onset.

Fig. 4. Width proﬁles at 43 and 86 GHz. At 43 GHz, the analysis was
performed on the stacked image presented in B1, Fig. 2. The arrow in-
dicates the position of the emission gap in the 43 GHz map.
43 GHz proﬁle at z ∼ −0.25 mas, i.e. in the vicinity of the gap
of emission, is not observed at 86 GHz. Correspondingly, the 86
GHz map (Fig. 3) does not show a pronounced emission gap.2
The observed frequency dependence of the properties of this re-
gion supports the idea that the gap is the result of absorption,
which becomes very reduced at 86 GHz. If synchrotron opac-
ity is responsible for the it, the gap most likely marks the true
location of the central engine. A detailed spectral analysis us-
ing more sensitive data is in progress with the aim of clarifying
the nature of this feature. Absorption may also explain another
striking aspect of the width proﬁles in Fig. 4. While results at
the two frequencies are quite consistent in the jet side, the 43
GHz counter-jet appears narrower than at 86 GHz. The puzzling
asymmetry between the opening angles of the approaching and
receding side observed at 43 GHz in B1, almost disappears at 86
GHz. The existence of a parsec scale free-free absorber cover-
ing the counter-jet was suggested by several studies (Krichbaum
et al. 1998; Bach et al. 2004; Struve & Conway 2010) and may
well explain the observed features. The results presented in this
letter hint at the presence of sub-pc scale material that is still
highly opaque at 43 GHz but not at 86 GHz.

2 In principle, this comparison may be aﬀected by a misalignment of
the maps due to an opacity shift of the cores. However, this is expected
to be negligible at high frequencies, as conﬁrmed by a cross-correlation
of the jet parameters from which we infer a shift < 30 µas.
