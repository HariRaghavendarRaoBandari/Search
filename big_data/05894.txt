ON CYCLIC DNA CODES OVER F2 + uF2 + u2F2

HOJJAT MOSTAFANASAB AND AHMAD YOUSEFIAN DARANI

Abstract. In the present paper we study the structure of cyclic DNA codes of
even length over the ring F2 + uF2 + u2F2 where u3 = 0. We investigate two
presentations of cyclic codes of even length over F2 + uF2 + u2F2 satisfying the
reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint.

1. Introduction

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid containing the genetic instructing
used as the carrier of genetic information in all living organisms. DNA sequences
consists of four bases nucleotides: Adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T ) and
cytosine (C). A single DNA strand is an ordered quaternary sequence of the letters
A, G, T , and C with chemically distinct polar terminals known as the 5- and 3-ends.
These strands are paired with each other as a double helix. This pairing is done
by obeying the Watson-Crick model. According to this model, A and T bound to
each other and G and C bound to each other. A and G are called the complements
of T and C, respectively or vice versa. The complement of a base say X will be
denoted by X, for instance, the complement of A is A = T . As a general example,
if X = (GCAT AG) is a DNA strand, then its complement is X = (CGT AT C).
DNA strand pairing is done in the opposite direction and the reverse order. For
instance, the Watson-Crick complementary (WCC) strand of 3′ − ACT T AGA − 5′
is the strand 5′ − T CT AAGT − 3′.

The interest on DNA computing started by the pioneer paper written by Leonard
Adleman [4]. Adleman solved a hard (NP-complete) computational problem by
DNA molecules in a test tube. Also, Richard J. Lipton in [14] solved a hard com-
putational problem using the structure of DNA.

Cyclic codes over ﬁnite rings played a very important role in the area of error
correcting codes, see [2, 3, 8, 16, 20, 21]. Since then, the structure of DNA is used as
a model for constructing good error correcting codes and conversely error correcting
codes that enjoy similar properties with DNA structure are also used to understand
DNA itself. Gaborit and King in [9] discussed linear construction of DNA codes.
In [1], DNA codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds with four elements were studied by Abualrub
et al. Later, Siap et al. studied DNA codes over the ﬁnite ring F2[u]/ < u2 − 1 >
with four elements in [18]. Yildiz and Siap in [22] studied DNA codes over the ring
F2[u]/ < u4 − 1 > with 16 elements. Some other papers devoted to cyclic DNA
codes, see [5, 10, 11, 15].

Liang and Wang [13], investigated cyclic DNA codes over the ring F2 + uF2 where
u2 = 0. Cyclic codes over the ring F2 + uF2 + u2F2 have been discussed in series of
paper [3, 6, 7, 17, 19]. Here, we study a family of cyclic DNA codes of the ﬁnite ring
F2 + uF2 + u2F2 with 8 elements. Mainly, we discuss on cyclic codes of even length
over F2 + uF2 + u2F2 satisfying the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement
constraint. Also, we determine the relationship between the generators of cyclic
codes over F2 + uF2 + u2F2 and their duals.

2. Preliminaries

A linear code C of length n over a commutative ring R is an R-submodule of Rn.
An element of C is called a codeword. A code of length n is cyclic if the code is
invariant under the automorphism σ with σ(c0, c1, · · · , cn−1) = (cn−1, c0, · · · , cn−2).
It is well known that a cyclic code of length n over R can be identiﬁed with an ideal
in the quotient ring R[x]/hxn − 1i via the R-module isomorphism as follows:

(c0, c1, . . . , cn−1) 7→ c0 + c1x + · · · + cn−1xn−1 (mod hxn − 1i)

Rn −→ R[x]/hxn − 1i

There are 16 pairs constructed by four basic nucleotides A, T, G and C such as

AA, T T, GG, CC, AT, T A, GC, CG, GT, T G, AC, CA, CT, T C, AG, GA.

Let R be the ring F2 + uF2 + u2F2 = {0, 1, u, u2, 1 + u, 1 + u2, 1 + u + u2, u + u2}
where u3 = 0 mod 2. Since the ring R is of the cardinality 8, then we deﬁne the
map Φ which gives a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of R and the
8 codons which are given in Table 1.

Let X = x0x1 · · · xn−1 ∈ Rn be a vector. The reverse of X is deﬁned as X r =
xn−1xn−2 · · · x1x0, the complement of X is X c = x0 x1 · · · xn−1, and the reverse-
complement, also called the Watson-Crick complement (WCC) is deﬁned as X rc =
xn−1 xn−2 · · · x1 x0.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A linear code C of length n over R is said to be reversible if X r ∈ C
for all X ∈ C, complement if X c ∈ C for all X ∈ C and reversible-complement if
X rc ∈ C for all X ∈ C.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A linear code C of length n over R is called a DNA code if

(1) C is a cyclic code, i.e. C is an ideal of R[x]/hxn − 1i; and
(2) For any codeword X ∈ C, X 6= X rc and X rc ∈ C.

Theorem 2.3. ([3, Theorem 2(2)]) Let C be a cyclic code of even length n over R.
Then

(1) C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)i where g(x), pi(x) ∈ F2[x] with g(x) | (xn − 1)

mod 2, (cid:0)g(x) + up1(x)(cid:1) | (xn − 1) in F2 + uF2 and (cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1) |

(xn − 1) in R and deg(p2(x)) < deg(p1(x)). Or

(2) C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x), u2a2(x)i with a2(x) | g(x) | (xn − 1) mod 2

and deg(p2(x)) < deg(a2(x)). Or
(3) C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x), ua1(x) + u2q(x), u2a2(x)i with a2(x) | a1(x) |

and (cid:0)g(x) + up1(x)(cid:1) | (xn − 1) in F2 + uF2. Moreover, g(x) | p1(x)(cid:16) xn−1
g(x) (cid:17),
g(x) (cid:17), a2(x) | p2(x)(cid:16) xn−1
g(x) (cid:17)2
a2(x) | p1(x)(cid:16) xn−1
g(x) (cid:17), a2(x) | q(x)(cid:16) xn−1
g(x) | (xn − 1) mod 2, a1(x) | p1(x)(cid:16) xn−1
p2(x)(cid:16) xn−1

a1(x)(cid:17) and a2(x) |
a1(x)(cid:17). Moreover, deg(p1(x)) < deg(a1(x)), deg(p2(x)) <

g(x) (cid:17)(cid:16) xn−1

deg(a2(x)) and deg(q(x)) < deg(a2(x)).

For each polynomial f (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + arxr with ar 6= 0, the reciprocal of
f (x) is the polynomial f ∗(x) = xrf (1/x) = ar + ar−1x + · · · + a0xr. It is easy to
see that deg(f ∗(x)) ≤ deg(f (x)) and if a0 6= 0, then deg(f ∗(x)) = deg(f (x)). A
polynomial f (x) is called self-reciprocal if f ∗(x) = f (x). It is easy to check that if
f (x), g(x) are two polynomials such that f (x) | g(x), then f ∗(x) | g∗(x).

Lemma 2.4. Let R be a commutative ring and f (x) be a polynomial in R[x]/hxn −1i
with deg(f (x)) = t. Then

(1) xt+1f (x)r = f ∗(x) in R[x]/hxn − 1i.
(2) xn−t−1f ∗(x) = f (x)r in R[x]/hxn − 1i.

Proof. (1) Assume that f (x) = f0 + f1x + · · · + ftxt. Then

f (x)r = ftxn−t−1 + · · · + f1xn−2 + f0xn−1.

Hence

xt+1f (x)r = ft + ft−1x + · · · + f1xt−1 + f0xt = f ∗(x).

(2) By part (1).

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.5. Let C be a cyclic code of lenght n over a commutative ring R and
f (x) ∈ R[x]/hxn − 1i. Then f (x)r ∈ C if and only if f ∗(x) ∈ C.

Proof. Use Lemma 2.4.

(cid:3)

As a direct consequence of the above proposition, the following result follows:

Corollary 2.6. Let C be a linear code. Then C is reversible if and only if f ∗(x) ∈ C
for all f (x) ∈ C.

Lemma 2.7. Let fi(x), gi(x) ∈ F2[x] for i = 1, 2, 3. If

f1(x) + uf2(x) + u2f3(x) = g1(x) + ug2(x) + u2g3(x),

then fi(x) = gi(x) for i = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. Let f1(x) + uf2(x) + u2f3(x) = g1(x) + ug2(x) + u2g3(x). Multiplying u2 on
both sides we get u2f1(x) = u2g1(x). So f1(x) = g1(x). Hence uf2(x) + u2f3(x) =
ug2(x) + u2g3(x). Thus u2f2(x) = u2g2(x), which shows that f2(x) = g2(x). Finally,
easily we have that f3(x) = g3(x).
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.8. Let C be a cyclic code over R. Deﬁne

Cu2 = {u2k(x) | k(x) ∈ F2[x] and u2k(x) ∈ C}.

Notice that Cu2 is a subcode of C.

4

Remark 2.9. Regarding the map Φ, we have that Φ(u2R) = {GC, CG}.

Theorem 2.10. Let C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x), u2a2(x)i be a cyclic code over R
with a2(x) | g(x) mod 2. Then Cu2 = hu2a2(x)i.

Proof. Clearly hu2a2(x)i ⊆ Cu2. Let u2k(x) ∈ C be such that k(x) ∈ F2[x]. Then,
there are two polynomials λ(x), µ(x) ∈ R[x] such that

u2k(x) = λ(x)(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1) + u2µ(x)a2(x) ∈ C.

Let λ(x) = λ0(x) + uλ1(x) + u2λ2(x), where λi(x)’s are polynomials in F2[x]. Note
that, we may assume that µ(x) ∈ F2[x]. Thus

u2k(x) = λ0(x)g(x) + u(cid:0)λ0(x)p1(x) + λ1(x)g(x)(cid:1)

+ u2(λ0(x)p2(x) + λ1(x)p1(x) + λ2(x)g(x) + µ(x)a2(x)(cid:1).

Therefore, λ0(x) = λ1(x) = 0 and k(x) = λ2(x)g(x) + µ(x)a2(x). Since a2(x) | g(x),
then a2(x) | k(x) and so u2k(x) ∈ hu2a2(x)i. Consequently Cu2 = hu2a2(x)i.
(cid:3)

Now, we give a useful lemma.

Lemma 2.11. Let fi(x) ∈ F2[x] for i = 1, 2, 3. Suppose that deg(f1(x)) = r,
deg(f2(x)) = s and deg(f3(x)) = t where r > max{s, t}. Then

(cid:0)f1(x) + uf2(x) + u2f3(x)(cid:1)∗

= f ∗

1 (x) + uxr−sf ∗

2 (x) + u2xr−tf ∗

3 (x).

Proof. Without loss of the generality we may assume that s ≥ t. By [22, Lemma
4.2], we deduce that

(cid:0)f1(x) + uf2(x) + u2f3(x)(cid:1)∗

= f ∗

3. The reverse constraint

Theorem 3.1. Let C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)i be a cyclic code of even length n
over R with deg(g(x)) = r, deg(p1(x)) = s and deg(p2(x)) = t where r > s. Then C
is reversible if and only if

(cid:3)

(1) g(x) is self-reciprocal;

(b) xr−sp∗
(c) xr−sp∗
(d) xr−sp∗

1(x) = p1(x) and xr−tp∗
1(x) = g(x) + p1(x) and xr−tp∗
1(x) = p1(x) and xr−tp∗
1(x) = g(x) + p1(x) and xr−tp∗

2(x) = p2(x), or

2(x) = p1(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) = g(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) = g(x) + p1(x) + p2(x).

Proof. (⇒) Suppose that C is reversible. Consider C as an R[x]-module. Then, by
Lemma 2.11, it follows that

(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1)∗

= g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

2(x)

for some k(x) ∈ R[x]. Assume that k(x) = k0(x) + uk1(x) + u2k2(x) where ki(x)’s
are polynomials in F2[x]. This implies

g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

2(x) = k0(x)g(x) + u(cid:0)k0(x)p1(x) + k1(x)g(x)(cid:1)
+ u2(k0(x)p2(x) + k1(x)p1(x) + k2(x)g(x)(cid:1).

Now, Lemma 2.7 implies that g∗(x) = k0(x)g(x), xr−sp∗
1(x) = k0(x)p1(x)+k1(x)g(x)
and xr−tp∗
2(x) = k0(x)p2(x) + k1(x)p1(x) + k2(x)g(x). Since g∗(x) = k0(x)g(x) and
deg(g∗(x)) ≤ deg(g(x)), we have that k0(x) = 1 and so g(x) is self-reciprocal.
Therefore xr−sp∗
1(x) = p1(x) + k1(x)g(x); whence, comparing the degrees of the two
sides of this equality, shows that k1(x) = 0 or 1. On the other hand xr−tp∗
2(x) =
p2(x) + k1(x)p1(x) + k2(x)g(x). Again, comparing the degrees of the two sides,
implies that k2(x) = 0 or 1, and so there are four cases:
Case 1. If k1(x) = k2(x) = 0, then xr−sp∗
Case 2. If k1(x) = 1, k2(x) = 0, then xr−sp∗
p2(x) + p1(x).
Case 3. If k1(x) = 0, k2(x) = 1, then xr−sp∗
g(x).
Case 4.
p2(x) + p1(x) + g(x).
(⇐) Assume that (1) holds. If (2)(a) holds, then

2(x) = p2(x).
1(x) = p1(x) + g(x) and xr−tp∗

If k1(x) = k2(x) = 1, then xr−sp∗

1(x) = p1(x) and xr−tp∗

1(x) = p1(x) + g(x) and xr−tp∗

2(x) =

2(x)

In the case (2)(b) holds, we have

(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1)∗

2(x)

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

= g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗
= g(x) + u(p1(x) + g(x)) + u2(p1(x) + p2(x))
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + ug(x) + u2p1(x)
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + u(g(x) + up1(x)
+ u2p2(x)) ∈ C.

When (2)(c) holds, then

(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1)∗

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

= g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗
2(x)
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2(p2(x) + g(x))
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + u2g(x)
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + u2(g(x)
+ up1(x) + u2p2(x)) ∈ C.

6

Finally, if we have (2)(d), then

(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1)∗

2(x)

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

= g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗
= g(x) + u(p1(x) + g(x)) + u2(p1(x) + p2(x) + g(x))
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + ug(x) + u2p1(x) + u2g(x)
= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + u(g(x) + up1(x)
+ u2p2(x)) + u2(g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)) ∈ C.

Therefore C is reversible.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.2. Let C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x), u2a2(x)i be a cyclic code of even
length n over R with deg(g(x)) = r, deg(p1(x)) = s and deg(p2(x)) = t where
r > max{s, t}. Also, assume that a2(x) | g(x) | (xn − 1) mod 2. Then C is reversible
if and only if

(1) g(x) and a2(x) are self-reciprocal;
(2)

(a) xr−sp∗
(b) xr−sp∗

1(x) = p1(x) and a2(x) | xr−tp∗
1(x) = g(x) + p1(x) and a2(x) | xr−tp∗

2(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) + p1(x) + p2(x).

Proof. (⇒) Assume that C is reversible. Notice that there are two polynomials
t(x), s(x) ∈ R[x] such that

(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1)∗

= g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗
= g(x) + uxr−sp∗

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗
1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

2(x)
2(x)

= t(x)(cid:0)g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)(cid:1) + u2s(x)a2(x) ∈ C.

Let t(x) = t0(x) + ut1(x) + u2t2(x), where ti(x)’s are polynomials in F2[x]. Clearly,
we may assume that s(x) ∈ F2[x]. Thus

g∗(x) + uxr−sp∗

1(x) + u2xr−tp∗

2(x) = t0(x)g(x) + u(cid:0)t0(x)p1(x) + t1(x)g(x)(cid:1)

+ u2(t0(x)p2(x) + t1(x)p1(x) + t2(x)g(x)

+ s(x)a2(x)(cid:1).

Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.1, we deduce that g(x) is self-reciprocal, t0(x) =
1 and t1(x) = 0 or 1.
2(x) =
p2(x) + t2(x)g(x) + s(x)a2(x).
1(x) = p1(x) + g(x) and
xr−tp∗
By assumption we have a2(x) | g(x) mod 2. So

2(x) = p2(x) + p1(x) + t2(x)g(x) + s(x)a2(x).

1(x) = p1(x) and xr−tp∗

If t1(x) = 0, then xr−sp∗

If t1(x) = 1, then xr−sp∗

1(x) = p1(x) and a2(x) | xr−tp∗
1(x) = g(x) + p1(x) and a2(x) | xr−tp∗

2(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) + p1(x) + p2(x).

2(x) ∈ C. Then, there exist polynomials λ0(x), λ1(x), λ2(x) ∈ R[x] and

Moreover u2a∗
µ(x) ∈ F2[x] such that

u2a∗

2(x) = λ0(x)g(x) + u(cid:0)λ0(x)p1(x) + λ1(x)g(x)(cid:1)

+ u2(λ0(x)p2(x) + λ1(x)p1(x) + λ2(x)g(x) + µ(x)a2(x)(cid:1).

Therefore, λ0(x) = λ1(x) = 0 and a∗
then a2(x) | a∗

2(x) and so a∗

2(x) = λ2(x)g(x) + µ(x)a2(x). Since a2(x) | g(x),

2(x) = a2(x), i.e., a2(x) is self-reciprocal.

(⇐) We investigate only one case. Suppose that (1) and part (b) of (2) hold. Then

= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + ug(x)

= g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x) + u(g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x))
+ λ(x)u2a2(x) ∈ C.

Consequently C is reversible.

4. The reverse-complement constraint

In this section, the reverse-complement constraint is examined for cyclic codes.

Lemma 4.1. The following conditions hold:

(1) For any elements x, y, z ∈ F2, x + yu + zu2 = x + yu + zu2.
(2) For any a ∈ R, a + a = u2.
(3) For any a, b ∈ R, a + b = a + b + u2.

Proof. (1), (2) Regarding Table 1, the computations are easy.
(3) Let a, b ∈ R. By part (2),

a + b = a + b + u2 = (a + u2) + (b + u2) + u2 = a + b + u2.

From now on, we denote I(x) = 1+xn
1+x .

Theorem 4.2. Let f (x) ∈ R[x]. Then f (x)rc + u2I(x) = f (x)r.

Proof. Assume that f (x) = f0 + f1x + · · · + fr−1xr−1 + xr. Then

f (x)rc = 0 + 0x + · · · + 0xn−r−2 + 1xn−r−1
+ fr−1xn−r + · · · + f1xn−2 + f0xn−1
= u2 + u2x + · · · + u2xn−r−2 + (1 + u2)xn−r−1

Proof. Let C be reversible-complement. Since 0 + 0x + · · · + 0xn−1 ∈ C, we have that

0 + 0x + · · · + 0xn−1 = u2(1 + x + · · · + xn−1) = u2I(x) ∈ C.

Now, apply Theorem 4.2.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.4. Let C1, C2 be two reversible-complement cyclic codes of lenght n over
R. Then C1 + C2 and C1 ∩ C2 are reversible-complement cyclic codes.

Proof. Let X = x0x1 · · · xn−1 and Y = y0y1 · · · yn−1 be two arbitrary codewords in
C1 and C2, respectively. Then
(X + Y )rc = (xn−1 + yn−1) · · · (x1 + y1) (x0 + y0)

= (xn−1 + yn−1 + u2) · · · (x1 + y1 + u2) (x0 + y0 + u2) By Lemma 4.1(3)

= (cid:2)(xn−1 + u2) · · · (x1 + u2) (x0 + u2)(cid:3) + yn−1 · · · y1 y0

= (X rc + u2I(x)) + Y rc ∈ C1 + C2

which shows that C1 + C2 is reversible-complement.
reversible-complement.

It is evident that C1 ∩ C2 is

Corollary 4.5. Let C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x)i be a cyclic code of even length n
over R with deg(g(x)) = r, deg(p1(x)) = s and deg(p2(x)) = t where r > s. Then C
is reversible-complement if and only if

(1) u2I(x) ∈ C.
(2) g(x) is self-reciprocal;

2(x) = p1(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) = g(x) + p2(x), or

2(x) = g(x) + p1(x) + p2(x).

Example 4.6. Let x8 −1 = (x+1)8 = g8 over F2. Let C = hg(x)+up1(x)+u2p2(x)i,
where g(x) = g6, p1(x) = x5 + x and p2(x) = x4 + x2.
It is easy to check that
g(x) = x6 + x4 + x2 + 1 is self-reciprocal. Also, xip∗
2(x) = p2(x)
where i = deg(g(x)) − deg(p1(x)) and j = deg(g(x)) − deg(p2(x)). Then C is a cyclic
DNA code. Here, we present an algorithm for generating the 28 codewords of this
code which are given in Table 2. In the ﬁrst step, ﬁnd the presentation of elements
α(g(x)+up1(x)+u2p2(x)) where α ∈ R, and in the second step, ﬁnd the presentation
of all cyclic shifts of these elements. Note that the element u2I(x) = u2(x + 1)g(x) =
u2(x+1)(g(x)+up1(x)+u2p2(x)) has the presentation CGCGCGCGCGCGCGCG.
It is observed that C is a cyclic code with minimum Hamming distance 4

5. Dual cyclic codes over R

Let X = x0x1 . . . xn−1 and Y = y0y1 . . . yn−1 be two elements of Rn. Then we
denote the Euclidean inner product in Rn as hX, Y iE = x0y0 + x1y1 + · · ·+ xn−1yn−1.
Two elements X and Y are called orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean inner
product, if hX, Y iE = 0. The Hermitian inner product is deﬁned as hX, Y iH =
x0y0 + x1y1 + · · · + xn−1yn−1. Two elements X and Y are called orthogonal with
respect to the Hermitian inner product, if hX, Y iH = 0. The dual code C ⊥ with
respect to the Euclidean inner product of C is deﬁned as

C ⊥ = {X ∈ Rn | hX, Y iE = 0 for all Y ∈ C}.

The dual code C ⊥H with respect to the Hermitian inner product of C is deﬁned as

C ⊥H = {X ∈ Rn | hX, Y iH = 0 for all Y ∈ C}.

In the following theorem, the Euclidean dual and the Hermitian dual of a cyclic code
of lenght n over R are considered.

Theorem 5.1. Let C be a cyclic code of lenght n over R. The following conditions
are equivalent:

(1) C is reversible;
(2) C ⊥ is reversible;
(3) C ⊥H is reversible.

10

HOJJAT MOSTAFANASAB AND AHMAD YOUSEFIAN DARANI

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Let X = x0x1 . . . xn−1 be an arbitrary codeword in C ⊥. We claim
that X r ∈ C ⊥. Get a codeword Y = y0y1 . . . yn−1 ∈ C. Since C is reversible, then
Y r = yn−1 . . . y1 y0 ∈ C. Therefore

hX, Y riE = xn−1y0 + xn−2y1 + · · · + x0yn−1 = hX r, Y iE = 0.

Consequently the claim holds.
(1) ⇒ (3) Let X = x0x1 . . . xn−1 be an arbitrary codeword in C ⊥H and Y =
y0y1 . . . yn−1 be a codeword in C. Since C is reversible, then Y r = yn−1 . . . y1 y0 ∈ C.
Therefore

hX, Y riH = xn−1y0 + xn−2y1 + · · · + x0yn−1 = hX r, Y iH = 0.

Consequently X r ∈ C ⊥H , which shows that C ⊥H is reversible.
(2) ⇒ (1) and (3) ⇒ (1) By the fact that for every cyclic code C we have (C ⊥)⊥ = C
and (C ⊥H)⊥H = C.
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.2. Let C = hg(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x), ua1(x) + u2q(x), u2a2(x)i be a
cyclic code of even lenght n over R with a2(x) | a1(x) | g(x) | (xn − 1) mod 2, also
a1(x) | p1(x), a2(x) | p2(x) and a2(x) | q(x). Moreover, assume that deg(g(x)) = r,
deg(p1(x)) = s and deg(p2(x)) = t where r > max{s, t}, also deg(a1(x)) = l,

deg(q(x)) = m with l > m. If C ⊥ = hbg(x)+ubp1(x)+u2bp2(x), uba1(x)+u2bq(x), u2ba2(x)i

is the dual cyclic code of C, then

1(x) ν(x) for some ν(x) ∈ F2[x].
g∗(x) η(x) for some η(x) ∈ F2[x].

a∗

Proof. (1) Since bg(x) + ubp1(x) + u2bp2(x) ∈ C ⊥ and u2a2(x) ∈ C, then by Lemma
4.4.8 of [12], we have that (bg(x) + ubp1(x) + u2bp2(x))(u2a∗

a∗(x) | (xn − 1)∗ = xn − 1. So bg(x) = xn−1

2(x) = 0
2(x) = 0 mod hxn − 1i. Notice that a(x) | (xn − 1) implies

2(x) α(x) for some α(x) ∈ F2[x].

(2) Again, by Lemma 4.4.8 of [12],

1(x) = 0 mod hxn − 1i.

(uba1(x) + u2bq(x))(ua1(x) + u2q(x))∗ = u2ba1(x)a∗

(4) Notice that

g∗(x) γ(x) for some γ(x) ∈ F2[x].

1(x) β(x) for some β(x) ∈ F2[x].

Hence ba1(x) = xn−1
(3) Since (u2ba2(x))(g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x))∗ = u2ba2(x)g∗(x) = 0 mod hxn − 1i,
then ba2(x) = xn−1
(uba1(x) + u2bq(x))(g(x) + up1(x) + u2p2(x))∗ = uba1(x)g∗(x) + u2ba1(x)xr−sp∗
+ u2bq(x)g∗(x) = 0 mod hxn − 1i.
1(x), by part (2) we get uba1(x)g∗(x) = u2ba1(x)p∗

0 mod hxn − 1i. Hence u2bq(x)g∗(x) = 0 mod hxn − 1i, and so bq(x) = xn−1

1(x) =

(5) We have that

g∗(x) η(x) for some η(x) ∈ F2[x].

6. Conclusion

We have investigated some properties of generator polynomials of reversible and
reversible-complement cyclic codes with even lenght over the ring F2 + uF2 + u2F2
using the mathematical structure of DNA. We have found a condition under which
a reversible cyclic code is reversible-complement. Moreover, we have presented the
relationship between the generator polynomials of cyclic codes over F2 + uF2 + u2F2
and their duals.
