Vanadium dioxide is of broad interest as a spin-1/2 electron system that realizes a metal-insulator
transition near room temperature, due to a combination of strongly correlated and itinerant electron
physics. Here, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering is used to measure the excitation spectrum of
charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom at the vanadium L-edge under diﬀerent polarization and
temperature conditions. These spectra reveal the evolution of energetics across the metal-insulator
transition, including the low temperature appearance of a strong candidate for the singlet-triplet
excitation of a vanadium dimer.

Vanadium dioxide is a spin-1/2 electron system that
undergoes a metal-insulator transition near room tem-
perature [1], and has been the subject of strong interest in
both basic and applied research. When cooling through
the transition, vanadium atoms pair into strongly hy-
bridized dimers as the the crystal structure changes from
rutile (R phase) to monclinic (M1 phase) [2, 3]. The
mechanism driving this transition incorporates Peierls
splitting of the bonding and antibonding states of the
dimer basis [4, 5] and represents a fascinating crossover
from itinerant to localized behavior in an electron system
that is intrinsically poised at the threshold of becoming
a Mott insulator [6–11]. A key challenge to establishing
a comprehensive understanding of VO2 based systems is
that, though the gapping of symmetric and antisymmet-
ric states within vanadium dimers is of central impor-
tance in motivating the metal to insulator transition, ex-
citations across these gaps have not yet been experimen-
tally resolved. Here, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(RIXS) at the vanadium L-edge is used to measure the
evolution of vanadium site energetics across the transi-
tion. Close comparison with a ﬁrst principles based mul-
tiplet cluster model is used to identify symmetries within
the RIXS spectrum, and reveals a strong candidate for
a symmetric-to-antisymmetric excitation that breaks the
singlet bond of a low temperature vanadium dimer.

The orbital character of VO2 electronic states was ﬁrst
explored by Goodenough [12], and is outlined in Fig.
1(a). The octahedral-like crystal ﬁeld splits vanadium
3d orbitals into π∗ (t2g) and σ∗ (eg) manifolds. Elec-
trons in the ground state largely occupy a π∗ orbital
termed ‘d(cid:107)’, with lobes that point between neighboring

vanadium atoms along the chain axis (cR-axis). When
cooling into the low temperature M1 phase (Fig.1(b)),
dimerization of vanadium atoms along the cR-axis splits
the d(cid:107)-derived states into symmetric and antisymmetric
manifolds. The d(cid:107) derived states are split by the Peierls
transition into bonding and antibonding states (db(cid:107) and
da(cid:107)), which are energetically modiﬁed and manifest addi-
tional DOS features (e.g. db∗
(cid:107) ) due to local entanglement
and correlations [9, 10, 13].

Elements of strong correlation have been well estab-
lished in the electronic structure of VO2 [9, 11, 14–
16], and singlet bonding between dimerized vanadium
sites with well deﬁned 3d1 occupation is thought to
explain the nonmagnetic nature of the insulating M1
phase. However, the excitations that best represent
energetic changes upon entering the M1 phase, includ-
ing bonding-antibonding (db(cid:107) to da(cid:107)) excitations and the
singlet-triplet excitation of vanadium dimers, fall within
an antisymmetric sector that is not strongly accessed by
optical (Q ∼ 0) spectroscopies. Non-optical experimen-
tal studies of the electronic density of states have largely
made use of single-particle spectroscopies in which an
electron is added to or removed from a vanadium site,
which does not give information about coherent elec-
tronic transitions such as the singlet-triplet mode.
In
the present study, soft X-rays provide suﬃcient momen-
tum transfer along the dimer axis for direct symmetric-
to-antisymmetric excitations to appear in RIXS spectra
(see Fig. 3 discussion), making it possible to measure
antisymmetric-sector excitations directly as outlined in
Fig. 1(b).

FIG. 1: Orbital symmetries of VO2 electronic states:
(a) Orbital symmetries of electronic states are labeled for
(left) the high-temperature metallic state and (right) the low-
temperature insulating state, with the Fermi level indicated
by a dashed line. The labels db∗
(cid:107) and da(cid:107) indicate gapped d(cid:107)-
symmetry states expected in the M1 phase. (b) Schematics
show anticipated RIXS excitations that could be achieved by
changing the symmetry of a d(cid:107) electron. Scenarios are pre-
sented for (left) the rutile metal and for hypothetical M1 in-
sulating states based on (middle) strongly correlated singlets
and (right) itinerant Peierls band physics. Higher energy ex-
citations involving the oxygen π/σ orbitals are not depicted.

RIXS measurements were performed at the ADRESS
beamline of the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scher-
rer Institute [17, 18], with combined energy resolution
better than ∆E=90 meV at the RIXS incident energy of
hν=515.6 eV. The linear polarization of the incident pho-
tons could be set either perpendicular (σ-polarization) or
parallel (π-polarization) to the scattering plane. This ex-
perimental conﬁguration allows one to selectively probe
excitations with polarization perpendicular (E ⊥ cR) or
near-parallel (E (cid:107) cR) to the rutile cR-axis. Measure-
ments were carried out at temperatures of (insulating)
260 and (metallic) 320K, with base pressures better than
5×10−11 torr. The incident photons were maintained
at a grazing angle of 15◦ and RIXS was measured at an
acute outgoing angle of 65◦ with respect to the [001] sam-
ple surface (included angle is 50◦). Beam damage was
minimized by adopting a new beam spot for each mea-
surement. The high quality single crystalline VO2 ﬁlm
of 10nm thickness was grown on a TiO2(001) substrate
by pulsed laser deposition, following the procedures de-
scribed in Ref. [19]. Under these conditions, the metal-
insulator transition occurs sharply at TM I =295K, and
the cR/aR lattice constant ratio is 0.617 [16, 19].

The RIXS and XAS spectral functions are simulated
for the experimental scattering geometry by the standard
atomic multiplet method, augmented to incorporate two
equivalently treated vanadium atoms with interatomic

hopping via the d(cid:107) orbital (see details in online Supple-
mental Material [20]). First principles calculations esti-
mate the intra-dimer d(cid:107) hopping parameter to be more
than an order of magnitude larger than inter-dimer d(cid:107)
hopping [9], making this a good approximated basis for
the analysis of low energy excitations in the M1 insulat-
ing state.

The vanadium L-edge polarization-dependent XAS
spectra of VO2 in the M1 phase are shown in Fig. 2(a,
top), and are well studied in previous research [21, 22].
These high-resolution measurements were carried out us-
ing the total electron yield method at the elliptically po-
larized undulator beamline 4.0.2 of the Advanced Light
Source, in the Vector Magnet endstation [23], and employ
the same experimental geometry as the RIXS measure-
ments. Separate spectral features associated with the L3
and L2 core hole symmetries are observed at ∼517 eV
and ∼524 eV respectively, each having weak leading edge

features followed by a strong high energy peak. Intensity
near the L3 maximum is greatest with polarization paral-
lel to the axis of vanadium dimerization (cR-axis), while
intensity at L2 is enhanced when polarization is normal
to the dimer axis. The atomic multiplet simulation in
Fig. 2(a, bottom) reproduces these characteristics, with
a ∼0.5 eV discrepancy in some feature energies within
the E (cid:107) cR channel.

Low energy excitations from 0-4 eV are measured by
RIXS in Fig. 2(b). Broad features centered at roughly
∼0.6 eV and ∼2.3 eV are consistent with the energy gaps
expected for excitation of a d(cid:107) electron into the octa-
hedral π∗ (t2g) and σ∗ (eg) symmetry state manifolds,
and have been labeled accordingly. Spectral intensity at
low temperature is greatly suppressed within the ∆=0.6
eV insulating gap of VO2 [13, 24], and is partly ﬁlled-in
when the sample is heated into the metallic phase. Re-
markably, the π∗ (t2g) excitation feature has signiﬁcant
polarization dependence, and has an intensity maximum
inside the 0.6 eV insulating gap when measured at low
temperature with polarization parallel to the cR-axis. It
is also noteworthy that upon cooling into the insulating
phase, no feature appears at ∼1.4 eV, the expected en-
ergy of a ds(cid:107) to d∗
(cid:107) excitation in the itinerant limit (1.4 eV
is roughly twice the inter-dimer d(cid:107) hopping parameter
[9]).

To understand these spectra, low energy excited states
of the dimerized V2 atomic multiplet model are used to
calculate the RIXS spectral function in Fig. 3, via the

Kramers-Heisenberg equation:

Here, the spectral intensity is dependent on both the
excitation energy (E) and the incident energy (hν), which
determine the degree of resonance for scattering paths
from the ground state ’g’ to intermediate core hole states
’m’ and the ﬁnal excited states ’f’, which are broadened
by inverse lifetime terms (Γ). All ﬁnal excited states fall
within symmetric (Q = 0) or antisymmetric (Q = π)
sectors, and appear with diﬀerent matrix elements for
polarization polarization parallel and perpendicular to
the dimer axis (see Fig.
In the experi-
mental geometry chosen for this study, the momentum
(Q) transferred from the scattering event has a com-
ponent of Q = 0.26π along the dimer axis, in units of
the inverse distance between nearest neighbor vanadium
atoms. This resulting RIXS spectrum is derived 84%
(cos(0.26π/2)2 = 0.84) from the Q = 0 ﬁnal state sector
and 16% (sin(0.26π/2)2 = 0.16) from the Q = π sector.
All of the symmetry sectors show qualitatively similar
RIXS spectra, with prominent peaks at E∼0.8 eV and
E∼2.3 eV representing transitions from the d(cid:107) orbital to
non-bonding excited states involving the octahedral π∗

FIG. 4: Polarization dependence and feature attribution: (a) Incident energy dependence of RIXS intensity in the
singlet-triplet excitation and non-bonding π∗ (t2g) excitation is simulated for the experimental conditions. The singlet-triplet

orbitals (E=0.72 eV, Γ=1.5 eV); (3) dd excitations into σ∗ (eg) orbitals (E=2.33 eV, Γ=1.5 eV); and (4) metal-ligand charge
transfer excitations (E=7.2 eV, Γ=5.25 eV). The singlet-triplet excitation constitutes 23% weight of the combined feature (1-2)
peak when polarization is parallel to the cR-axis, and just 8% under orthogonal polarization.

citation sector diﬀers from the optically accessible Q = 0
spectrum in that a singlet-triplet excitation of the dimer
is found at 0.42 eV, 26% reduced from the singlet-triplet
gap (ds(cid:107) to dt(cid:107) transition) expected from perturbation the-

ory in the strongly correlated limit (
eV=0.57 eV). Charge transfer excitations between the
vanadium atoms are not seen, as they occur at a higher
energy scale than the plotted range. Calculated spec-
tra for the experimental momentum value are shown in
Fig. 3(c,f), and show the three features outlined in the
“Singlet” scenario of Fig. 1(b).

Close comparison between experiment and theory is
complicated by the fact that most experimental features
appear at energies larger than the band gap, and may be
signiﬁcantly broadened due to rapid decay of multiplet
states into delocalized band excitations [25]. Plotting
the experimental results over a larger energy range in Fig.
4(b-c) reveals that higher energy line features are qualita-
tively broader, and sharp line shapes comparable with ex-
perimental resolution are only found within the insulat-
ing gap. Taking this trend into account, the experimental
data under each polarization condition are well ﬁtted by
four Lorentzians representing the three low energy fea-
tures found in the simulation, as well as one high energy
excitation at 7.2 eV, which can be principally attributed
to metal-ligand charge transfer. Feature energies below
E<4 eV are lower than nearby peak energies seen in the
imaginary part of the dielectric constant by optical spec-
troscopies [26–30]. This is in part due to diﬀering ex-
citation symmetries [31], and can also be attributed to
the spatially localized nature of the RIXS scattering pro-
cess, which couples to coherent atomic-exciton-like ﬁnal
states. The direct RIXS excitations of strongly corre-

lated systems with a single electron degree of freedom
per atom (e.g. cuprates, vanadates) correspond closely
with the diﬀerence between orbital site energies set by
the crystal ﬁeld [32], whereas optical excitations repre-
sent transitions between band continua.

A particularly dramatic slope is seen from 0.2-0.5 eV
under E (cid:107) cR polarization (Fig. 4(b)) and means that,
given the above constraints, an good ﬁt for that polar-
ization condition must include a larger component of the
sharp in-gap singlet-triplet mode. Attribution of this
mode to the singlet-triplet dimer-breaking excitation is
further supported by the fact that this sharp feature is
no longer evident upon heating into the non-dimerized
metallic phase (Fig. 1(b)), and that no analogous feature
is seen in optical (Q ∼ 0) measurements on analogous
thin ﬁlm samples [26]. With this feature attribution and
better separated singlet-triplet and non-bonding modes,
we anticipate that it would be possible to identify a more
detailed line shape dressed by the interplay of coherent
phonon states and the inter-vanadium hopping param-
eter as atomic positions relax following the breaking of
the singlet bond.

To assess the likely accuracy of this ﬁt, a summary of
the calculated intensity of scattering in the singlet-triplet
excitation (E∼0.45 eV) versus non-bonding π∗ (t2g) sym-
metries (E∼0.8 eV) near the experimental RIXS incident
energy of hν=515.6 eV is shown in Fig. 4(a). Within
a ±0.25 eV neighborhood surrounding the RIXS energy,
the singlet-triplet feature accounts for 19.3% of the inten-
sity in a combined t2g feature under E (cid:107) cR polarization
and 4.5% of the intensity with E ⊥ cR. These numbers
show a good qualitative correspondence with values of
23% and 8% respectively from the ﬁt. The model ap-
pears to underestimate the overall intensity of such a
combined feature in the E ⊥ cR channel, however the

energy in both polarization channels have a close ±0.2

In summary, RIXS has been used to measure the ener-
gies of single particle transitions between the signiﬁcant
orbital manifolds of VO2. By comparison with a ﬁrst
principles-derived numerical model, we ﬁnd a strong cor-
respondence between this spectrum and the electronic
states expected in a strongly correlated picture for low
temperature vanadium dimers. Scattering matrix ele-
ments are found to enable the ﬁrst experimental mea-
surement of the singlet-triplet excitation that breaks the
singlet spin bond of a vanadium dimer. Polarization
and temperature dependence in the experimental spec-
tra are used to identify a strong candidate for this fea-
ture at E=0.46 eV. These results provide a window into
the gap structure and high energy landscape underlying
the metal-insulator transition of VO2, and more gener-
ally demonstrate the power of the RIXS technique as an
incisive probe of correlated energetics in transition metal
compounds.
