Sideband Rabi spectroscopy of ﬁnite-temperature trapped Bose gases

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

We use Rabi spectroscopy to explore the low-energy excitation spectrum of a ﬁnite-temperature
Bose gas of rubidium atoms across the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). To
record this spectrum, we coherently drive the atomic population between two spin states. A small
relative displacement of the spin-speciﬁc trapping potentials enables sideband transitions between
diﬀerent motional states. The intrinsic non-linearity of the motional spectrum, mainly originating
from two-body interactions, makes it possible to resolve and address individual excitation lines.
Together with sensitive atom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited
atoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As an example, we
show that for a nearly pure BEC of N = 800 atoms the ﬁrst excited state has a population of less
than 5 atoms, corresponding to an upper bound on the temperature of 30 nK.

Experimental realizations of atomic Bose-Einstein con-
densates (BECs) are always at ﬁnite (i.e. non-zero) tem-
perature, meaning that excited states are also populated.
Besides being interesting from a fundamental point of
view, this is also expected to limit the coherence time of
the BECs [1, 2] and the ﬁdelity of non-classical states
[3, 4], posing a limit to their application in quantum
metrology and quantum information processing. Experi-
mentally, this has been explored in particular in the case
of BECs in a double-well potential [5, 6].

For the study of ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects, a key in-
gredient is the knowledge of the excitation spectrum of
the system, from which thermodynamic quantities can
be derived. For this reason, the excitation spectrum of a
BEC has been a matter of extensive studies [7]. Experi-
mentally one relies both on the ability of preparing BECs
with the desired particle number and temperature, and
on addressing speciﬁc excitation lines. For this, mainly
two techniques have been developed and applied to var-
ious temperature regimes: trapping-potential perturba-
tions to study low-energy excitations [8–10], and two-
photon Bragg transitions to probe high-energy excita-
tions (where the spectrum is a quasi-continuum) [11–13].

In contrast, experiments with single particles or non-
interacting ensembles in ion traps and optical dipole
traps have successfully adopted sideband-resolved Ra-
man and Rabi spectroscopy techniques to probe the par-
ticle’s excitation spectrum and control its external de-
grees of freedom [14–18]. In particular, these techniques
can be used to measure the temperature or to perform
motional ground-state cooling in systems where the low-
est part of the spectrum has modes equally spaced in
energy [16–18].

In this paper, we extend the Rabi spectroscopy tech-
nique to an interacting many-body system, to probe the
excitation spectrum of a ﬁnite-temperature Bose gas in
a harmonic trap across the BEC phase transition. More-
over, we present a method to control the temperature at

FIG. 1.
(Color online) Rabi spectroscopy of trapped Bose
gases. Green (orange) thick solid lines sketch the eﬀective
trapping potential for single-particle excitations in state |1i
(|2i). The blue shaded regions represent mean-ﬁeld poten-
tials. Horizontal dashed lines represent the single-particle en-
ergy levels. The few ﬁrst values α and β of the indices used in
Eqs. (3) and (4) are shown for each trap. The blue horizontal
line indicates the BEC chemical potential (see Eq. (2)). The
arrows show some possible transitions from the BEC or from
the thermal cloud (blue dots). Black arrows are called carrier
transitions while blue (red) arrows are examples of blue (red)
sideband transitions.

ﬁxed atom number in such a system. The experimental
procedure is similar to the one adopted in Ref. 18 for
non-interacting thermal atoms. We apply a Rabi pulse
that coherently couples two atomic internal states, whose
trapping potentials are slightly spatially displaced by a
microwave dressed-state potential [19] to enable transi-
tions between diﬀerent motional states. Then, ﬁnal pop-
ulations of the two internal states are measured as func-
tions of the frequency of the Rabi drive to characterize
the excitation spectrum of the ﬁnite-temperature sample
across the BEC phase transition. Above the critical tem-
perature, we observe almost symmetric sidebands, while
at extremely low temperatures no red sideband can be de-

tected, placing a lower bound on the number of particles
in excited modes in a region where standard time-of-ﬂight
measurements are ineﬀective.

We use 87Rb atoms in the hyperﬁne states |1i ≡ |F =
1, mF = −1i and |2i ≡ |F = 2, mF = 1i, conﬁned in a
chip-based magnetic trap characterized by its oscillation
frequencies ωx/2π = 112 Hz along the axial direction and
ωy/2π = ωz/2π = 517 Hz along the transverse directions.
Because the magnetic moments of |1i and |2i are approxi-
mately the same for magnetic ﬁelds near 3.23 G, the same
trap is experienced by both states [20, 21]. To allow for
independent control of both atom number and temper-
ature, we use the following sequence. We ﬁrst prepare
a pure BEC containing several thousand particles in |1i
by radio-frequency (rf) evaporative cooling [22]. Atom
number and temperature of such a BEC are not inde-
pendent. To overcome this, a further rf evaporation sets
and stabilizes the temperature and the particle number
(to N = 400 ± 50) by cutting deeply into the BEC with
the “rf-knife”. Then, the temperature of the sample is
increased by applying a controlled sinusoidal shaking of
the trap. The current in the wire that provides trans-
verse conﬁnement of the atoms [19] is slightly modulated
at ωmod during 400 ms. Primarily, this results in an
oscillation of the trap position along the vertical axis z
with an amplitude of ±4 µm for a current modulation
with relative amplitude of 1.0 × 10−2. The amplitude
along the two other directions is of the order of 1 µm,
and the axial (transverse) trap frequency is modulated
by up to 16% (8%). The modulation frequency is set to
ωmod = 2π × 1035 Hz ≃ 2ωz ≃ 2ωy, and heats the sample
by resonant parametric excitation of the transverse mo-
tion. After the shaking, we wait for 1 s to ensure ther-
malization of the cloud. This has been veriﬁed by noting
that the oscillation of both shape and position of the
atom cloud in time-of-ﬂight measurements are damped,
and it is consistent with estimates of the thermalization
time due to collisions at our densities [7]. For a para-
metric heating process [23], we expect that the deposited
energy scales with the squared modulation amplitude.
While the heat capacity of a thermal cloud is constant,
that of a BEC is non-trivial [5]. In Fig. 2, this leads to a
distorted temperature scale below TC. By time-of-ﬂight
images, we observe that for samples in which thermal
wings are visible, the width of these wings increases lin-
early with the shaking amplitude, conﬁrming that the
temperature in time-of-ﬂight scales as the square of the
shaking amplitude (see bottom panel of ﬁg. 2).

Our spectroscopy pulse is a two-photon Rabi drive,
coupling |1i to |2i (see Fig. 1 and Refs. 19 and 20). The
driving ﬁelds are emitted by an rf-coil and a microwave
horn, placed far away from the chip so that the ﬁelds
are spatially homogeneous over the sample. While the
frequency of the microwave is kept ﬁxed, the frequency
of the radio wave can be changed to vary the detuning
∆ of the Rabi pulse with respect to the |1i to |2i tran-

2

sition. ∆ = 0 is deﬁned as the resonance of the Rabi
drive with the trap bottoms, taking microwave level shifts
into account (see Fig. 1). The Rabi pulse is weak in the
sense that the Rabi frequency ΩRabi/2π ≃ 3.5 Hz is much
smaller than the trapping frequencies. The Rabi pulse
length is tRabi = 140 ms corresponding to a full spectral
width at half maximum of the order of 10 Hz, suﬃcient
to resolve the vibrational sidebands in the trap.

If the traps for the two states |1i and |2i are perfectly
identical (i.e. δx = 0 in Fig. 1), the only possible vibra-
tional transitions are carrier transitions (black arrows in
Fig. 1). To enable sideband transitions (blue and red ar-
rows in Fig. 1), we apply a state-dependent microwave
potential [19] generated by an on-chip microwave cur-
rent. It displaces the trap for |2i by δx, much less than
the typical size of the BEC, along its weak conﬁnement
axis x (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 19). This state-dependent po-
tential also decreases the energy diﬀerence between the
two trap bottoms by a few hundred Hz due to microwave
level shifts, which we take into account in our deﬁnition
of ∆.

After the spectroscopy pulse, the ﬁnal populations are
recorded with two absorption images, which allow us to
independently count the number of particles transferred
by the pulse into |2i and the remaining particles in |1i,
in every single realization of the experiment. Before de-
tection we release the atoms by smoothly ramping down
the trapping potential so that the atom cloud is decom-
pressed and accelerated away from the chip surface. This
release ramp is optimized so that the cloud is small at the
time of detection, maximizing the atom number sensitiv-
ity. This decompression produces an adiabatic cooling
that reduces the observed temperature in time-of-ﬂight
compared to the in-trap temperature by a constant fac-
tor. The scaling we observe with the shaking amplitude
is thus valid for in-trap temperatures as well.

The top panel of Fig. 2 shows transfer probabilities
(relative population in state |2i after the Rabi pulse)
as a function of the detuning ∆ and the trap shaking
amplitude, for a displacement between the two traps of
δx = 0.13 µm. Note that the maximal population trans-
fer stays always below 50%, even if ΩRabitRabi ≃ π. This
is because even if the pulse starts on resonance with some
transition, it will end up oﬀ resonance during the popu-
lation transfer due to changes in the mean-ﬁeld potential
[24]. This panel clearly shows two distinct behaviors.
On the left side, i.e. on the low temperature/pure BEC
side, one carrier line and one blue sideband are visible
in the spectrum. The carrier line (blue sideband) cor-
responds to population transfer from the BEC in |1i to
the ground state (ﬁrst excited state) in the eﬀective trap-
ping potential for |2i (see Fig. 1). There is no visible red
sideband signal, conﬁrming that the BEC is very pure
in our coldest sample. For a non-interacting system, we
would expect that the ﬁrst blue sideband is separated
from the carrier by ωx/2π = 112 Hz. Here, we measure

δx = 0.13 µm and N = 400 atoms. Top panel: Population
transfer as a function of the shaking amplitude and the de-
tuning ∆. The ∆ = 0 detuning point is identiﬁed with the
center of the carrier line for the non-interacting thermal en-
semble. Central panel: histograms of the peak density after
time-of-ﬂight as a function of the shaking amplitude. The
peak density is roughly proportional to the condensed frac-
tion. It is rescaled such that 0 corresponds to no atoms and 1
is reached on average for the pure BEC. TC is identiﬁed with
the location of the step, and corresponds to a relative shaking
of 2.5 × 10−3. Bottom panel : Fitted Gaussian widths of the
thermal distribution as a function of the shaking amplitude.
Black points are statistical averages; error bars are errors on
the mean. No data are shown for small shaking amplitudes
since the clouds do not show any thermal component. The
red line is a linear ﬁt to the data, showing a quadratic scaling
of the temperature measured in time-of-ﬂight with the shak-
ing amplitude for T > TC. Since our time-of-ﬂight sequence
starts with a smooth release ramp to optimize atom counting,
we cannot extract any quantitative in-trap temperature esti-
mates from the ﬁtted widths, but the observed scaling with
the shaking amplitude holds nonetheless. The in-trap tem-
perature axis drawn on top of the ﬁgure is constructed from
the known scaling with the shaking amplitude for a thermal
ensemble and from the location of the critical point.

42 Hz, which means that the inter- and intra-species in-

3

teractions strongly aﬀect the spectrum on the BEC side.
On the right side of Fig. 2, i.e. on the high temperature
side [25], the spectrum shows both red and blue side-
bands surronding the carrier line at ≈ ±ωx/2π, close to
what one would expect for a non-interacting ensemble.

Between these two extreme cases, the system crosses
the BEC critical point. From the sudden decrease of the
peak density (central panel of Fig. 2), as well as from
the dramatic change observed in the spectrum, we esti-
mate that the sample reaches the critical temperature TC
for a relative shaking amplitude of 2.5 × 10−3. For our
atom number (N = 400) and trapping potential, con-
sidering ﬁnite size and interaction eﬀects [7], we calcu-
late TC = 87 nK. Around the critical point, the peak
density ﬂuctuates strongly between a low value, char-
acteristic of a thermal ensemble, and a high value, in-
dicating the existence of a BEC. Approching TC from
higher temperatures, we can see that the frequencies of
the sidebands stay constant while the amplitude grad-
ually decreases and the amplitude asymmetry becomes
more pronounced. This asymmetry is stronger than pre-
dicted by the Bose-Einstein distribution in a harmonic
trap, and it is explained below by a model that includes
trap anharmonicities. At temperatures below TC the
thermal sidebands are no longer visible, and the two-
peak structure appears, indicating that transitions from
the macroscopically-populated BEC mode dominate the
spectrum. As the condensate fraction increases, the car-
rier line bends down due to mean-ﬁeld shifts. The total
shift of the carrier line (from the non-interacting/high
temperature limit to the fully condensed one) is δf ≃
22 Hz. To ﬁrst approximation, if we neglect the dis-
placement between the two traps and assume a small
transfer, this shift can be seen as the energy diﬀerence
between a BEC in |1i containing N particles and a BEC
of N − 1 particles in |1i interacting with a single par-
ticle in the same spatial mode but in |2i. This energy
diﬀerence is h δf = µ (a12/a11 − 1), where a11 = 100.4 a0
and a12 = 98.01 a0 are the scattering lengths [26], a0 is
the Bohr radius, and µ is the chemical potential in |1i.
Solving for δf = 22 Hz, we expect the chemical potential
to be µ/h = 922 Hz. A Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of
our system gives µ/h = 966 Hz, in agreement with the
measurement.

A detailed spectrum of the pure BEC case is shown in
Fig. 3, corresponding to the leftmost column of the top
panel of Fig. 2 but in this case recorded with N = 800.
The measurement is compared to a time-dependent two-
component Gross-Pitaevskii model (GPM) [27] in the
rotating-wave approximation (red line) taking as inputs
the atom number, the trapping potentials (V1 and V2, as-
sumed harmonic), the splitting distance δx and the Rabi
pulse length tRabi and strength ΩRabi calibrated from in-
dependent measurements. The coupled equations for the
two BEC wavefunctions Ψ1 and Ψ2 are

Rabi pulse with respect to the |1i to |2i transition,
gij = 4π2aij/m are the collisional interaction strengths
(with a22 = 95.44a0), and the wavefunctions are nor-
malized to the particle numbers in each mode. The two
trapping potentials are identical but separated by δx,
i.e. V2(~r) = V1(~r − δx ~ex). A simulation of the trap-
ping potential shows that the trap anharmonicity can be
neglected for the pure BEC case. Our GPM neglects par-
ticle losses [26], since we have noticed that the spectrum
is insensitive to losses for the evolution time we are con-
sidering. Without any free parameters, the GPM repro-
duces the width of the lines, the spacing between them
and their strength. Note that the slight overestimation of
the strength of the carrier line can be explained by a mis-
calibration of both the pulse area and the displacement

δx.

With inﬁnitely slow Rabi drive and inﬁnitesimal trans-
fer, the spectrum at zero temperature should present sev-
eral sharp lines, one per eigenstate for |2i weighted by the
Franck-Condon factor with the initial BEC wavefunction.
In practice, however, the peaks are convolved with the
Fourier transform of the ﬁnite-time Rabi pulse and dis-
torted by the Rabi frequency nonlinearity. The distorted
cardinal sine (sinc) shape observed in Fig. 3 for both the
experiment and the model conﬁrms that the Rabi pulse
is Fourier limited and that the time-dependent GPM is
needed for a ﬁne analysis of the spectrum.

We also compare the spectrum with the following time-
independent model [28], which allows to describe also
ﬁnite-temperature cases. For state |1i, the BEC mode
function Ψ1 is obtained from the Gross-Pitaevskii equa-
tion,

Note that α and β are non-negative integers, labeling all

Since at zero temperature the only initially populated
state is the BEC in Ψ1, all the allowed transitions have
energy diﬀerences ∆Eβ = E2β − µ and are weighted by
|hΨ1|Ψ2βi|2, according to Fermi’s golden rule. To repro-
duce the ﬁnite spectral size of the Rabi pulse, we con-
volve the spectrum with a sinc function of 10 Hz FWHM.
Since this model does not predict the absolute transfer
eﬃciency, we set the overall amplitude of the spectrum
to be the same as for the time-dependent GPM. The re-
sult is shown in Fig. 3 as the green-dashed line. The
model reproduces the data well, with the exception of
the asymmetric shape of the peaks.

(Color online) Rabi sideband spectroscopy (blue
points) for a thermal ensemble as a function of the detun-
ing (5.0 × 10−3 relative shaking amplitude). The errorbars
indicate statistical uncertainties. The red line is the result
from the high-temperature model described in the text, see
Eqs. (5). We ﬁnd γ ≃ 2π × 2.5 Hz µm−1 .

Fig. 3 take into account that we averaged over 20 mea-
surements per detuning. The measured population in |2i
at the expected frequency of the red sideband is consis-
tent with zero within our measurement uncertainty. We
estimate the transfer probability at this red sideband to
20%. We can thus put an upper bound on the population
of the ﬁrst excited vibrational state in our coldest sample
of ≈ 5. This estimate is conﬁrmed by the simulation of
the spectrum of a BEC containing 5 atoms in the ﬁrst
excited state, corresponding to a temperature of 30 nK,
(dashed black line in the inset of Fig. 3). For these pa-
rameters, the total number of thermal excitations is 15.
This spectrum is computed from the time-independent
model Eqs. (2)-(4), where the populations of the excited
states are given by the Bose-Einstein distribution. Detec-
tion of single excitations could be achieved in our setup
by averaging over 1500 measurements.

A detailed spectrum for a thermal ensemble with N ≈
800 and for a reative shaking amplitude of 5.0 × 10−3 is
shown in Fig. 4. In the case of non-interacting particles
in a harmonic trap, the spectrum would show three lines
spaced by ωx/2π convolved with the Fourier transform
of the Rabi pulse. The main diﬀerence to this ideal pic-
ture is that the peaks we observe are asymmetric, not
equally spaced and broader than expected. This can be
explained by an anharmonicity in the spectrum, which
can arise from interactions and anharmonicities in the
trapping potentials. To describe this high temperature
system, we use the following model. Thermal atoms in
|1i (|2i) occupy the modes Ψ1α (Ψ2β), solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equations

where the constant γ characterizes the potential anhar-
monicity.
In practice, it is a free parameter extracted
by ﬁtting the data. We found γ ≃ 2π × 2.5 Hz µm−1,
which we check to be in reasonable agreement with ex-
pected anharmonicity from simulations. Like in the pre-
vious model, the spectrum we obtain is the sum over all
allowed transitions between a thermally populated Ψ1α
and an initially empty mode Ψ2β. We can see from Fig. 4
that this model (red line in ﬁgure) gives a very good de-
scription of the regime above TC. It is interesting to note
that the relative amplitude between the red and the blue
sideband is strongly aﬀected by anharmonicities, making
it diﬃcult and unreliable to extract a temperature from
it.

For comparison, Fig. 5 shows the same experiment as
in Fig. 2 but for a splitting distance δx = 0.26 µm and
N = 630. A larger splitting distance increases the over-
lap between eigenstates with larger diﬀerence of vibra-
tional index, allowing higher-order Rabi transitions. On
the BEC side a second blue sideband appears and, in the
low temperature limit, its position is also in good agree-
ment with the models Eq. (1) and Eqs. (2)-(4). On the
high temperature side, three blue sidebands and at least
two red sidebands are observed. An additional feature
visible on this side is the gradual appearance of higher-
order sidebands as the temperature increases. It is in-
teresting to note that, for the temperature range we are
probing, the ratio between the amplitudes of a blue side-
band and its red counterpart has a weaker temperature
dependence than the ratio between the amplitudes of a
blue (or red) sideband and an adjacent one. However, al-
ready the simple model of a single particle in a harmonic
potential shows that the former ratio is better suited for
thermometry, since the only free parameters are the trap-
ping frequencies, while the latter ratio also depends on
the Franck-Condon factor, and therefore the splitting dis-
tance is needed in order to extract the temperature.

In conclusion, we presented a technique to prepare
BECs with a well-deﬁned atom number and variable tem-
perature, using a rf-evaporation and a subsequent con-
trolled shaking of the trap, and the sideband Rabi spec-
troscopy of such ﬁnite-temperature BECs. The measured
spectra show resonance peaks that are in good agreement
with theoretical models. This spectroscopy technique is
especially eﬃcient to probe the low energy excitations.
In the coldest BECs we prepared, we can exclude the
presence of more than 5 atoms in the ﬁrst excited state,
corresponding to a temperature below 30 nK. At this
temperature, no thermal cloud is visible in time-of-ﬂight

FIG. 5. (Color online) Finite temperature spectroscopy for
δx = 0.26 µm. Same experiment as in Fig. 2 with twice
the splitting distance. Here the BEC transition temperature
is identiﬁed at a relative shaking amplitude of 3.0 × 10−3

images. We estimate that single excitation detection is
reachable in our setup with 1500 measurements per de-
tuning [30]. A higher sensitivity per experimental re-
alization can be reached with a single-atom resolution
imaging system, and by optimizing the Rabi pulse pa-
rameters. Furthermore, this technique can be used to
prepare BECs in excited motional states.

We acknowledge helpful discussions with A. Sinatra,
C. Klempt, and H.-C. N¨agerl. This work was supported
