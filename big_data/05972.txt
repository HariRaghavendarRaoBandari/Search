Abstract

We address the problem of diffusion on a comb whose teeth display a varying length. Speciﬁ-

cally, the length ℓ of each tooth is drawn from a probability distribution displaying the large-ℓ behavior

P (ℓ) ∼ ℓ−(1+α) (α > 0). Our method is based on the mean-ﬁeld description provided by the well-tested

CTRW approach for the random comb model, and the obtained analytical result for the diffusion coefﬁcient

is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations. We subsequently incorporate retardation effects arising from bind-

ing/unbinding kinetics into our model and obtain a scaling law characterizing the corresponding change in

the diffusion coefﬁcient. Finally, our results for the diffusion coefﬁcient are used as an input to compute

concentration recovery curves mimicking FRAP experiments in comb-like geometries such as spiny den-

drites. We show that such curves cannot be ﬁtted perfectly by a model based on scaled Brownian motion,

i.e., a standard diffusion equation with a time-dependent diffusion coefﬁcient. However, differences be-

tween the exact curves and such ﬁts are small, thereby providing justiﬁcation for the practical use of models

relying on scaled Brownian motion as a ﬁtting procedure for recovery curves arising from particle diffusion

in comb-like systems.

INTRODUCTION

Random walks of particles in complex environments play a central role as models for anoma-

lous transport processes in physics, biology and chemistry. In this context, a wealth of experimen-

tal evidence shows that slowing-down of particle diffusion is a common occurrence [1]. In order

to set up a random walk model tailored for the experimental situation at hand, one would ideally

like to have a detailed knowledge of the microscopic mechanisms underlying the slowed-down

diffusion. However, this remains a challenging issue, since typically a number of possible factors

responsible for the onset of subdiffusive regimes coexist and it is often difﬁcult to identify the

dominant effect(s). Among such factors are strong geometric constraints associated with fractal,

labyrinthine an disordered environments, viscoelastic effects, excluded volume interactions due to

obstacles, crowding effects, binding/unbinding processes of different nature, cage effects due to

electrostatic interactions, etc.

In order to capture the phenomenology leading to subdiffusion, three types of models are often

invoked, namely [2]: random walks in complex geometries, random walks with non-independent

increments (resulting in anti-persistence effects), and walks displaying memory effects (aging).

Each model class differs in its statistical properties from the other two, yet there may be instances

in which different models yield a fairly similar behavior of a speciﬁc quantity. This fuels the

debate as to which model class is the most appropiate one to account for the behavior observed in

a given experiment, and the use of hybrid models in this context is not uncommon [3]. However,

even if one chooses to work with a model belonging to a single class, one still has to deal with

many challenges. Focusing on the category of walks in complex geometries, attempts to shed

light on the relationship between transport properties and the topological details of the embedding

support often face considerable difﬁculties. For example, complex geometries often lead to non-

trivial behavior, such as the onset of crossover regimes between normal diffusion and anomalous

diffusion. In the particular case of branching geometries, such effects are observed because of the

large time needed by the diffusing walkers to explore the complexity of the environment in full

detail.

In the above context, comb and comb-like models [4–10] use simple, idealized geometries to

capture the essential features of transport in natural branching structures and, more generally, to

mimic transport properties of disordered networks. The basic idea is to distribute a number of

vertical teeth along a one-dimensional line (the backbone), and to allow random walkers diffuse

2

throughout the resulting structure, whereby occasional excursions along the teeth may be viewed

as trapping events which slow down the particles’ motion along the backbone. The simplest situa-

tion corresponds to the regular comb model [6], where both the separation between adjacent teeth

and the length of each tooth are constant quantities. In the general case, the separation and the

tooth length are random variables.

A comprehensive list of examples for which comb and comb-like structures are relevant can be

found in Refs. [11] and [12], including spiny dendrites, diffusion of drugs in the circulatory system,

energy transfer in polymer systems, etc. Other examples include oxygen exchange in lungs and

water circulation in river networks [13]. While the regular comb model was originally devised to

study anomalous transport properties in percolation clusters, more sophisticated extensions thereof

[11, 12, 14–25] have been used to make the phenomenology richer and to account for the presence

of heterogeneities and spatial disorder in real systems.

In the present work, we shall focus on the problem of diffusion on a comb displaying a random

variability in the lengths of its teeth, a subject that has already been discussed to some extent in

previous works [7, 10, 16, 26–32]. Speciﬁcally, the length ℓ of each tooth is drawn from a distri-

bution whose large-ℓ behavior is given by the asymptotic form P (ℓ) ∼ ℓ−(1+α). The characteristic

exponent α > 0 can be used to control the rate at which particles diffuse along the backbone. On

the other hand, the random comb model can be regarded as a somewhat raw picture of real-world

comb-like systems such as spiny dendrites, which indeed show a variability in the spine length.

At least in some cases, the latter appears to follow a power-law distribution. For example, Fig. 4

in Ref. [33] shows that the spine length follows a non-Gaussian distribution which turns out to be

well ﬁtted by a power law in the appropriate regime (data not shown).

In an extended version of our model, we shall also consider the effect of combining particle

transport with binding/unbinding events. In biological comb-like systems such as spiny dendrites

in Purkinje neurons, the mobility of signaling species such as calcium ions is strongly hindered by

morphological factors leading to signal compartmentalization in single spines [34] (corresponding

to comb teeth in the simpliﬁed picture of our model). However, the range of action of free calcium

ions is also severely limited by the effect of binding proteins. This exempliﬁes the relevance of

retardation effects associated with binding/unbinding kinetics in biological systems.

A popular experimental technique for the characterization of diffusive transport concomitant

with binding/unbinding kinetics is based on so-called FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Pho-

tobleaching) experiments. In these experiments, the diffusing molecules in the system are ﬁrst

3

ﬂuorescently tagged, and then those molecules found in a small region (“the bleached spot”) are

photobleached by a brief, intense laser pulse. The resulting relaxational dynamics leads to a reﬁll-

ing of the bleached spot and to the recovery of the associated ﬂuorescent signal, which is monitored

with the help of suitable microscopy techniques [35, 36].

Recently, the experimental characterization of FRAP kinetics in comb-like systems such as

spiny dendrites in neurons has attracted some interest [34, 37, 38]. Typically, individual spines

are photobleached and the subsequent concentration recovery is modeled by means of one-

dimensional effective transport equations. Here, we shall consider a more general setting in

which the propagation of unbleached particles takes place throughout the entire comb geometry,

including both the teeth and the backbone.

Despite the intensive analytical and computational work performed on FRAP models so far

[36, 39–43], the theoretical characterization of FRAP dynamics on comb-like structures does not

seem to have been dealt with. In the present work, we shall address this issue in detail and obtain

analytic and numerical results for concentration recovery curves. As it turns out, these recovery

curves cannot be reproduced exactly by means of a standard diffusion equation with a suitably

chosen time-dependent diffusion coefﬁcient. However, the resulting discrepancy appears to be

small, suggesting that such models may be acceptable for certain purposes.

A ﬁrst step towards the solution of the FRAP problem on the random comb is the calculation

of the diffusion coefﬁcient of the particles. An early work by Havlin et al. [26] showed that in the

random comb model a crossover from subdiffusion to normal diffusion takes place when the decay

exponent α of the power law exceeds the threshold value α = 1. For 0 < α < 1 this random comb

model was shown to yield anomalous diffusion with a characteristic exponent γ = (1 + α)/2.

Other works focusing on the behavior of the diffusion exponent in the random comb model

are also found in the literature [16, 30]. However, the behavior of the diffusion coefﬁcient for the

particle motion along the backbone of the comb is only partially known. For the case of normal

diffusion (α > 1), the diffusion coefﬁcient was computed via different methods [30, 44, 45]. In

the subdiffusive regime (α < 1), the diffusion coefﬁcient of the subset of particles located on the

backbone is known [27, 46]. This quantity can be formalized as follows. Let us take the backbone

as the x-axis, and let the y-axis denote the vertical direction along which the comb teeth extend

(see Fig. 1). The mean square displacement (MSD) of the subset of particles on the backbone

can then be expressed as hx2i =R x2G(x, y = 0, t) dx/R G(x, y = 0, t) dx, where G(x, y, t) is the

probability density (Green’s function) to ﬁnd a walker which started from a given initial condition

4

at position (x, y) at time t. In contrast, the case of interest in the context of the FRAP relaxation

problem addressed in Sec. VI refers to the diffusion properties of the full set of particles, i.e., those

found on the backbone and on the teeth. In terms of the Green’s function, the corresponding MSD

of a walker is hx2i =RR x2G(x, y, t) dxdy. This case was studied in Ref. [30], but the expression

for the associated diffusion coefﬁcient was only given for the normal diffusion case (α > 1).

The present work aims to ﬁll this gap by providing an explicit expression for the diffusion

coefﬁcient in various regimes and subsequently validating it by means of extensive Monte Carlo

simulations. To this end, we shall resort to the well-tested mean-ﬁeld approach provided by the so-

called continuous time random walk (CTRW) model [6, 16, 26, 30, 46]. In this approach, particle

excursions along the teeth are considered to be “a waste of time” as far as diffusion along the

backbone is concerned. Since a particle moving randomly along a tooth does not experience any

change in its horizontal position, the waiting time between subsequent changes in the x-coordinate

will follow a distribution which is directly related to the tooth length distribution P (ℓ).

The remainder of the present work is organized as follows: Sec. II gives a detailed deﬁni-

tion of the random comb model and shows how it is implemented in our numerical simulations.

Sec. III presents numerical results for the time-dependence of the MSD along the backbone of

the comb. Sec. IV deals with the CTRW-based method used for the analytical computation of the

diffusion coefﬁcient. Sec. V discusses the role of retardation effects arising from the combination

of transport and binding/unbinding events. Sec. VI is devoted to a comprehensive analytical and

numerical treatment of FRAP dynamics in the random comb model. The results in this section

are based on the well-known asymptotic equivalence between the CTRW model and the fractional

diffusion equation [47]. Finally, Sec. VII gives a summary of the main conclusions and outlines

5

some avenues for future research. Technical details concerning the calculation of the waiting time

probability density function (pdf) associated with the most general form of the diffusion coefﬁ-

cient are given in Appendix A. The solution of the boundary value problem for FRAP dynamics

by means of the Green’s function formalism is given in Appendix B.

II. DEFINITION OF THE MODEL AND SIMULATION PROCEDURE

In order to address the problem of diffusion on the random comb, we ﬁrst introduce the regular

comb model. As already mentioned, the regular comb consists of a backbone and equally spaced

teeth of a ﬁxed length. A particle diffusing along the backbone may encounter a tooth and perform

an excursion along it before eventually returning to the backbone. The case of a regular comb with

inﬁnite tooth length ℓ → ∞ was discussed in Ref. [6]. In the appropriate regime, this model yields

subdiffusive behavior with anomalous diffusion exponent equal to 1/2, that is, hx2i ∝ t1/2.

If the regular spacing between the teeth is kept (or, more generally, if this spacing follows a

probability distribution with ﬁnite variance) yet random changes in the tooth length are allowed

(see Fig. 1), one obtains a speciﬁc class of random comb models displaying a surprisingly rich

phenomenology. In particular, the length ℓ may be chosen independently for each tooth by drawing

its value from a distribution whose asymptotic behavior is P (ℓ) ∼ ℓ−(1+α), where α > 0. In what

follows, we focus on this speciﬁc case, which was already discussed in Refs. [7] and [26]. In those

references it was shown that the system exhibits anomalous subdiffusion along the backbone axis

for 0 < α < 1, i.e., one has hx2(t)i ∼ tγ with γ = (1 + α)/2. In contrast, for α > 1 there

is a crossover to normal diffusion, that is, hx2(t)i ∼ t. At the crossover value α = 1 there

is a logarithmic correction, and hence hx2(t)i ∼ t/ ln(t). Thus, the decay exponent α of the

tooth length distribution can be used to tune the value of the diffusion exponent in the range

1/2 ≤ γ ≤ 1.

Our ﬁrst goal will be to discuss the results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations implemented

on the random comb structure depicted in Fig. 1. In order to carry out the simulations, we dis-

cretized the comb geometry as follows. The unit length (lattice spacing) was chosen to be equal to

the distance between two consecutive teeth, and each tooth consisted of a randomly chosen integer

number of lattice spacings.

The choice of the discretized tooth length was implemented as follows. We attached a tooth

of integer length ℓk = ⌊r−α⌋ to each backbone site k, where r denotes a uniformly distributed

6

random number (0 < r < 1) and ⌊ξ⌋ = max {m ∈ Z | m ≤ ξ} stands for the ﬂoor function.

Thus, the probability P (ℓ) that a randomly chosen tooth had a length of exactly ℓ lattice spacings

is

P(ℓ) = ℓ−α − (ℓ + 1)−α.

As a result of the above prescription, the tooth length follows approximately the pdf

P (ℓ) = α ℓ−(1+α).

(1)

(2)

This expression becomes increasingly accurate as ℓ becomes larger.

A collection of random walkers were then allowed to perform nearest-neighbor jumps on the

discretized system at regular time intervals (the time unit was taken to be the ﬁxed waiting time

between two consecutive jumps). Speciﬁcally, the walk of each particle on the random comb was

implemented as follows. When a given walker was on a tooth (y > 0), its motion was restricted

to the vertical direction (x(t) = const). As soon as the walker returned to the backbone (y = 0),

it could either jump back to y = 1 with probability 1/2, or move along the x-axis with probability

1/2 (to the left with probability 1/4 or to the right with probability 1/4).

The boundary conditions in x- and y-directions were implemented as follows. Since each real-

ization of the comb geometry could contain a ﬁnite number of teeth only, we introduced periodic

boundary conditions along the x-direction in order to preserve the translational invariance of the

system. We thus considered a ﬁnite system of N random walkers in a “periodic box” of M length

units, where typically 200 ≤ M ≤ 1600 and 1000 ≤ N ≤ 8000. For sufﬁciently large values of

M, typical diffusion properties of individual walkers no longer display a signiﬁcant size depen-

dence if the simulation time is not too long, thereby ensuring that the typical diffusion distance is

small with respect to the linear system size. Thus, the behavior of the ﬁnite system is expected to

become indistinguishable from that of the corresponding inﬁnite system.

Particle jumps in y direction were limited by the ﬁnite tooth length ℓ. Whenever a given particle

would reach the end of a tooth (y(t) = ℓ), at the next time step t + ∆t, the particle would either

moved back to site ℓ−1, or else attempt to perform a jump beyond the end of the tooth y(t+∆t) =

ℓ+1. In the latter case, it was “reﬂected back”, as a result of which it remained in the same position

[y(t + ∆t) = y(t) = ℓ].

In order to speed up the simulations, several walkers were randomly scattered along the back-

bone and then launched simultaneously. In this case, the Monte Carlo time step was deﬁned as

∆t = 1/N, where N is the number of walkers [48]. At each time step, one particle was randomly

7

chosen and performed a jump (unless it attempted to “exit” a tooth, in which case it remained at

its upper end). The selection of the particle was either sequential or random, both choices leading

to similar results in the long time limit. Thus, a time unit corresponded to N time steps, that is,

to N attempted movements of the walkers. With the above choice, the time unit N∆t = 1 does

not depend on the number of particles. Typical simulation times were t ≤ 108, whereas maximum

excursions along the y-axis were of the order of 400 lattice spacings.

III. ONSET OF ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION: NUMERICAL STUDY OF THE LONG-TIME

ASYMPTOTICS AND TRANSIENT REGIMES

In order to study diffusive transport along the backbone, we computed the MSD at time t by
generating nq independent realizations of the comb geometry and then letting N non-interacting
walkers simultaneously evolve in each of them. The MSD is given by the formula

hx2(t)i =

1
nq

1
N

nqXs=1

NXj=1

[x(s)

j (t) − x(s)

j (0)]2,

(3)

where x(s)
j (t) denotes the x-coordinate of the j-th walker diffusing in the s-th realization of the
quenched disorder. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, it is understood that all the walkers were placed

at random on the backbone at the beginning of each run. For speciﬁc calculations, the average

over quenched disorder was typically performed over nq = 50 conﬁgurations, corresponding to 50
different landscapes {ℓk}.

According to previous references [7, 26], the long-time behavior of the MSD is

hx2(t)i = D0(α) tγ,

(4)

with γ = (α + 1)/2 for 0 < α < 1 and γ = 1 for α > 1. The above analytical prediction is

corroborated by the results displayed in Fig. 2, where the behavior of hx2i/tγ is plotted for dif-

ferent values of α. In the long-time regime this quantity typically reaches a well-deﬁned plateau.

In contrast, no plateau is observed when α = 1 (this is precisely the α-value at which a transi-

tion between anomalous diffusion and normal diffusion is observed). In this case, the quantity

hx2i/tγ ≡ hx2i/t follows an inverse logarithmic law (see caption of Fig. 2).

In those cases where the simulation time is long enough to observe a plateau, the asymptotic

values of hx2i/tγ obtained from the simulation data displayed in Fig. 2 can be used to estimate
the values of the α-dependent effective diffusion coefﬁcient D0(α) ≡ limt→∞hx2i/tγ.

In the

8

approximate range 0.5 < α < 1.5, the simulation time is not long enough to allow the system to

reach a plateau. However, since hx2(t)i/tγ decreases monotonically in time, the smallest value
of this quantity can be used as an upper bound for D0. The behavior of D0 is shown in Fig. 3.
The diffusion coefﬁcient is seen to display non-monotonic behavior, ﬁrst it decreases and then it

increases with increasing α.

FIG. 2. Double logarithmic plots for the time evolution of hx2i/tγ as obtained from numerical simulations. The
anomalous diffusion exponent is assumed to be given by the theoretical prediction, i.e., γ = (1 + α)/2 for α < 1
and γ = 1 for α ≥ 1. All particles are initially located on the x-axis (y(0) = 0). The different curves correspond,
from top to bottom to α = 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 (top ﬁgure) and to α = 99.0, 2.0, 1.7, 1.5, 1.2, 1.1. and 1 (bottom
ﬁgure). The additional dashed curve corresponding to the behavior of 1/ ln(t) is seen to match the asymptotic long-
time behavior when α = 1. For α = 0.5, the data represented by the curve denoted by ”r” correspond to the case
where the particles are initially distributed at random along the teeth, and no particles are placed on backbone sites.

We close this section with a comment on the role of the initial condition. According to our

simulation results, the long-time value of hx2i/tγ and the corresponding exponent γ are not inﬂu-

enced by the speciﬁc initial condition. As an example, one may consider the case where all the

dots marked with vertical bars correspond to α-values for which the simulation time is not sufﬁcient for hx2i/tγ
to reach a plateau. In such cases, the dots provide upper bounds for D0(α). The solid curve corresponds to the
theoretical expression given by Eq. (23) for 0 < α < 1, and by Eq (28) for α > 1. The dashed horizontal line denotes
the asymptotic value D0(α → ∞) = 1/4, corresponding to a uniform teeth with ℓ = 1 everywhere.

particles are initially scattered at random along the teeth only, and no particles lie on the backbone

(i.e., y(0) > 0 for all the particles). The dashed curve denoted by “r” in Fig. 2 corresponds to one

such initial condition implemented for the case α = 0.5. As expected, the MSD hx2(t)i at short

times is smaller than for our previous initial condition with all the particles lying on the backbone

(see the solid curve displayed in Fig. 2 for α = 0.5). The reason is of course that particles on the

teeth must ﬁrst return to the backbone in order to be able to contribute to the increase of hx2(t)i.

IV. EVALUATION OF THE ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT VIA THE CTRW MODEL

A. General formalism

As already mentioned, the values of the diffusion coefﬁcient D0(α) can be read off the plateaus
of Fig. 2 for different values of α. We now proceed to compute D0(α) analytically by means of
the mean-ﬁeld CTRW approximation for the random comb. Admittedly, the comb model displays

quenched conﬁgurational disorder, implying that the tooth length distribution does not change in

the course of the random walk. In contrast, the CTRW model can be regarded as an annealed ver-

sion of the comb model in which the length of a given tooth is drawn anew from the corresponding

distribution upon each revisitation of the walker. In line with a number of previous references

(e.g. [27, 30]), we shall hereafter assume that the difference between the quenched system and the

10

annealed system underlying the CTRW approach can be ignored as far as the leading asymptotic

behavior of the diffusive process is concerned. As we shall see, this hypothesis will a posteriori

ﬁnd strong support in the agreement between the analytical results obtained in the present section

and the simulations results displayed in Sec. III.

As far as diffusion along the x-axis is concerned, the time spent by a walker traveling along the

y-axis can be regarded as a waiting time between two consecutive steps along the backbone. Thus,

the movement of the walker along the x-axis can be described by means of the CTRW model. In

this model, the waiting time distribution function ψ(t) is the key quantity. Below, we show how to

evaluate ψ(t) for the random comb model.

Our method follows closely the one laid out in Ref. [26] by Havlin et al., which is based on the

computation of the exact long-time asymptotic form of ψ(t) underlying the analytic expression for

the diffusion coefﬁcient (note, however, that we found it necessary to include some results which

supplement the original calculation by Havlin et al.). We shall begin by computing the probability

Tn(ℓ) that a random walker starting at site y = 1 takes at least n steps along a tooth of length ℓ
before arriving for the ﬁrst time at the bottom of the tooth (y = 0, intersection with the backbone).
For this purpose, the site y = 0 can be thought of as a perfect trap, implying that Tn(ℓ) can be
identiﬁed with the survival probability of the walker up to the n-th time step given that its initial

position is y(0) = 1.

In order to compute Tn(ℓ), we shall choose for convenience a boundary condition that is slightly
different from the one employed in the simulations (the latter corresponds to the one considered

by Havlin et al. [26]). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, throughout the present section we shall assume

that a walker at the end of a tooth (y = ℓ) will always step back to the site y = ℓ − 1 immediately

below the end site. Note the difference with respect to the boundary condition implemented in

the simulations, which speciﬁes that the walker either remains at the end site y = ℓ (if it attempts

to “exit” the tooth) or else it steps back to site y = ℓ − 1, whereby each of these two mutually

exclusive events takes place with probability 1/2.

With our choice for the boundary condition, the cumulative probability Tn(ℓ) becomes iden-
tical with the survival probability of a walker moving on a one-dimensional lattice with 2ℓ sites,

whereby both end sites play the role of perfect traps. For our purposes, the above setting is equiv-

alent to a walker placed on a ring with 2ℓ sites, i.e., 2ℓ − 1 non-absorbing sites and a single perfect

trap, whereby the walker’s initial position is a site contiguous to the trap.

A similar reasoning applies for the boundary condition chosen by Havlin et al. and imple-

11

mented in our simulations; however, the equivalent ring would consist of 2ℓ + 1 rather than 2ℓ

sites. While this difference can be disregarded for large enough ℓ, it becomes increasingly relevant

in the limit of short teeth. For 0 < α < 1 it turns out that the statistical weight of long teeth is very

relevant, and so the difference in the boundary condition is negligible for the computation of the

diffusion coefﬁcient. However, we shall see that this difference can no longer be neglected in the

α > 1 case.

Let pn(y) be the probability that the walker is at position y at step n when it starts at y = 1.
The boundary conditions then are pn(0) = pn(2ℓ) = 0, and the initial condition is p0(y) = δ1,y.
These probabilities satisfy the difference equation

pn+1(y) =

1
2

[pn(y − 1) + pn(y + 1)] .

The corresponding solution is

pn(y) =

1
ℓ

2ℓ−1Xj=1

cosn βj sin βj sin(βjy),

(5)

(6)

where βj = πj/2ℓ [It should be noted that the solution reported in Eq. (A4) in Ref. [26] is in-
consistent with the initial condition p0(y) = δ1,y]. The survival probability is then given by the
y=0 pn(y). For large ℓ one can perform the approximations cosn βj ∼
j /2] and sin βj sin(βjy) ∼ sin2(πj/2), which lead to the following asymptotic approxi-

expression Tn(ℓ) = P2ℓ

exp[−nβ2
mation for Tn(ℓ):

The above asymptotic expression does surprisingly well even if ℓ is not too large. The agreement
with the exact formula for Tn(ℓ) is especially good for large n.

The next step in our route to an analytic expression for ψ(t) is the computation of the proba-
bility Un(ℓ) for trapping to take place exactly at the n-th time step. We note that the absorption
probability Un(ℓ) can be regarded as the probability to reach either of the perfect traps located at
y = 0 and y = 2ℓ after exactly n steps (ﬁrst-passage probability). Clearly, Un(ℓ) can be expressed
as a difference between two survival probabilities, namely,

Un(ℓ) = Tn−1(ℓ) − Tn(ℓ),

(8)

where the initial conditions T0(ℓ) = 1 and U0(ℓ) = 0 hold. For even values of n the probability
Un(ℓ) must vanish, since for a walker starting at y = 1 it is impossible to reach either trap after an

even number of steps. Therefore, for any positive integer m one has T2m−1 = T2m, implying that
the equality Un(ℓ) = Tn−2 − Tn holds for odd-valued n. As a result of this, the large-n asymptotic
expression of Un can be estimated by regarding the time step n as a continuous variable and
computing the corresponding derivative, i.e.,

(9)

In order to make further progress, we must now ﬁnd estimates of the survival probability Tn(ℓ) and
the absorption probability Un(ℓ) averaged over an ensemble of teeth with different lengths. To this
end, we shall use the approximations T asy
n (ℓ) as deﬁned above. We shall distinguish
two cases, namely, 0 < α < 1 and α > 1. In the former case, the mean ﬁrst-passage time to the

n (ℓ) and U asy

intersection with the backbone does not exist, whereas in the latter case it is a ﬁnite quantity which

will later prove useful for the computation of the diffusion coefﬁcient.

B. Case 0 < α < 1

The average value of Tn(ℓ) with respect to the tooth length distribution is

hTni ≡ hTn(ℓ)i =

P(ℓ)Tn(ℓ),

∞Xℓ=1

(10)

where P(ℓ) denotes the probability that a randomly chosen tooth has a length of exactly ℓ units.

For the special case of the long-tailed distribution described by Eq. (2), the large-n behavior of the

survival probability is well described by the following approximation:

hT asy

n (ℓ)i = αZ ∞

Using Eq. (7) gives

where we have set

ˆψα = 2(1+α)/2(cid:0)2α+1 − 1(cid:1) π−α−1α Γ(cid:18)α + 3

2 (cid:19) ζ(α + 1).

(11)

(12)

(13)

In the above expression, ζ(·) stands for the Riemann zeta function. Note that the lower limit in

the integral appearing in Eq. (11) has been shifted from 1 to 0 in order to simplify its analytical

evaluation. This approximation is safe, since for ℓ-values between 0 and 1 and large n the integrand

13

becomes vanishingly small due to the fast decay of T asy
Eq. (7)). Using the asymptotic form (12) in Eq. (9) one ﬁnds

n (ℓ) for sufﬁciently small values of ℓ (cf.

hU asy

n (ℓ)i = 2 ˆψα n−(3+α)/2

(14)

for odd-valued n satisfying n ≫ 1.

Let ψn(ℓ) be the probability that a walker having started its walk at the backbone site (x, y = 0)
returns to it after exactly n−1 time steps, and then hops to a contiguous backbone site (x±1, y = 0)

at the n-th time step. Both sites (x ± 1, y = 0) can be regarded as perfect traps, implying that the
quantity ψn(ℓ) can be interpreted as a ﬁrst-passage probability to either of the two traps.

Let us recall that the probability θ for the walker to perform a transition (x, y = 0) → (x ±

1, y = 0) along the backbone has been assumed to be the same (θ = 1/2) as the probability to

move upwards (x, y = 0) → (x, y = 1). As a result of this prescription, one can see, upon a bit
of reﬂection, that the probability ψn(ℓ) of absorption at sites (x ± 1, y = 0) given that the walker
starts at site (x, y = 0) is equal to the probability Un(ℓ + 1) of absorption at y = −1 given that
the walker starts at site y = 0 on a one dimensional lattice stretching from y = −1 to y = ℓ (see

Fig. 4). Hence,

ψn(ℓ) = Un(ℓ + 1).

FIG. 4. Graphical representation of the equivalence between ψn(ℓ) and Un(ℓ + 1). The probability 1/2 of the walker
jumping from (x = 0, y = 0) to either (x = +1, y = 0) or (x = −1, y = 0) in the left ﬁgure is equal to the
probability of the walker jumping from y = 0 to y = −1 along the extended tooth shown on the right ﬁgure.

When θ 6= 1/2, the corresponding probability ψn(ℓ, θ) differs from ψn(ℓ) ≡ ψn(ℓ, θ = 1/2).

However, in the large-n regime there is a simple relation between both quantities, namely,

ψn(ℓ, θ) =

FIG. 5. Log-log plot of simulation results for ψn(ℓ, θ) (1 − θ)/θ vs. n for ℓ = 50 (squares), ℓ = 100 (diamonds)
and ℓ = 200 (circles) for θ = 1/2 (open symbols), θ = 1/3 (solid symbols) and θ = 2/3 (crossed symbols) for 109
realizations. Note the excellent collapse of the simulation results for the three different values of θ and sufﬁciently
large n (n ≥ 50, say). The solid curves are the asymptotic values of ψn(ℓ) obtained by means of Eqs. (7), (9) and
(15).

From the deﬁnition of hT asy
n (ℓ)i[1 + O(1/n1/2)] straightforwardly. Thus, setting ψn(ℓ) ≈ U asy

n (ℓ)i given by Eq. (12) one can ﬁnd the relation hT asy

n (ℓ + 1)i =
n (ℓ), taking the average over

hT asy

the tooth length pdf P (ℓ), and using Eq. (14) one obtains

hψni ∼ 2 ˆψα n−(3+α)/2,

n ≫ 1, n odd.

(17)

For θ 6= 1/2, this formula would be the same, except for the fact that ˆψα should be replaced

with θ ˆψα/(1 − θ) in that case.

We now seek to establish a relation between the above discrete-time description in terms of the

probabilities ψn and the continuous-time description based on the corresponding waiting time pdf
ψ(t). To this end, we ﬁrst average ψn over odd- and even-valued times n, i.e., we take

ψ(t)∆t ≈ ψ(t) × 2 = hψn−1i + hψni.

(18)

Eq. (15) together with the fact that Un vanishes for even values of n implies that hψni = 0 for
even-valued n. Taking this into account and making use of Eq. (18) in (17) we ﬁnd

ψ(t) ∼ ˆψα t−(3+α)/2,

t ≫ 1.

(19)

We are now in the position to perform an explicit computation of the diffusion coefﬁcient. To this

end, we recall that a CTRWer whose motion is described by the asymptotic long-tailed waiting

with 0 < γ < 1, displays subdiffusive behavior provided that its step length distribution has a

ﬁnite variance Σ2, implying that its MSD can be written as follows:

Γ(1 + γ)

tγ = D0(γ)tγ,

(21)

where Kγ ≡ Σ2/(2τ γ) and τ is a characteristic time scale for the waiting time between jumps
[47]. Comparing Eq. (19) with Eq. (20) one ﬁnds γ = (1 + α)/2 and τ γ = Γ(1 − γ) ˆψα/γ.
Inserting these expressions into Eq. (21) we ﬁnd

2−(1+α)/2 πα cos(cid:0) πα

2 (cid:1) ζ(α + 1)

If θ 6= 1/2, the diffusion coefﬁcient is simply D0(α, θ) = (1 − θ)D0(α)/θ. In our case, Eq. (23)
is further simpliﬁed by taking into account that the motion along the backbone proceeds by tran-

sitions between nearest-neighbor sites (occasionally delayed by excursions along the teeth). Thus,

one must take Σ2 = 1. The analytic expression provided by Eq. (23) turns out to be in excellent

agreement with our simulation data (cf. Fig. 3). We note that changes in the value of Σ can be

interpreted as a change in the density of teeth along the backbone, which according to Eq. (23)

has an inﬂuence on the diffusion coefﬁcient, but has no effect on the diffusion exponent γ. This

differs from the results reported for the dendritic system studied in Ref. [49].

C. Case α > 1

Here, it is well known that normal diffusion takes place regardless of the value of α, i.e.,

γ = 1 [7, 26]. The diffusion coefﬁcient for this case has already been calculated with a variety of

different methods [30, 45]. For the sake of completeness, a simple alternative derivation is given

below. Our derivation exploits the fact that for α > 1 the spatial average of the mean dwelling

time of the random walker inside a tooth is ﬁnite, implying that the diffusion coefﬁcient can be

written as follows:

K1(α) =

Σ2
2τ

⇒ D0(α) =

Σ2
τ

,

(24)

16

where τ is the (spatially averaged) mean waiting time between consecutive jumps along the back-

bone and, in the present context, Σ2 is the variance of the distance between consecutive teeth. Let

us now introduce the quantity τ (ℓ) as the average number of time steps that it takes for a walker

initially located at the bottom of a tooth of ℓ units to jump along the backbone, that is, to perform

the transition (x, y = 0) → (x ± 1, y = 0). One then has

τ = hτ (ℓ)iℓ =

P(ℓ) τ (ℓ).

(25)

∞Xℓ=1

Next, let us denote by tR(ℓ) the average number of time steps required by a walker initially located
at (x, y = 0) to return to its initial position given that it starts moving vertically along the tooth.

A walker starting at (x, y = 0) can reach (x ± 1, y = 0) after one time step with probability

1−θ = 1/2 provided that it does not enter the tooth, or it may enter the tooth once with probability
θ = 1/2, come back to (x, y = 0) after tR(ℓ) time steps, and then perform the ﬁnal transition
(x, y = 0) → (x ± 1, y = 0) with probability 1 − θ = 1/2, and so on. Summing up the

contributions from trajectories involving a different number of returns to the intersection with the

backbone, one ﬁnds

τ (ℓ) = 1 × (1 − θ) + (tR(ℓ) + 1) θ(1 − θ) + (2tR(ℓ) + 1) θ2(1 − θ) + . . .

= (1 − θ)

θn(n tR(ℓ) + 1) = 1 +

θ

1 − θ

tR(ℓ).

(26)

∞Xn=0

In writing the above equation, we have taken into account that the time needed for the walker

to move by one lattice spacing [i.e., from (x, y = 0) to either of its two nearest neighbor sites

(x = x ± 1, y = 0)] had been chosen to be equal to one. Had this time been set equal to a different
value tb, the expression ntR(ℓ) + 1 in Eq. (26) should have been replaced with ntR(ℓ) + tb.

As already mentioned, for the boundary condition used in the simulations (cf. Secs. II and III),

a tooth of length ℓ is equivalent to a one dimensional periodic lattice with 2ℓ + 1 sites. In that
case, tR(ℓ) can be understood as the mean return time to the origin of a walker on a ring of length
2ℓ + 1. On the other hand, it is well known that for a periodic N-site lattice this return time is

precisely identical with the number of lattice sites N [50, Eq. (4.172a)]. In the above setting, we
have N = 2ℓ + 1, leading to tR(ℓ) = 2ℓ + 1. From Eqs. (26) and (25) we then ﬁnd

τ =

in agreement with the results obtained in Refs. [30] and [45] [see, e.g., Eq. (48) in ref. [30]]. For

the particular case where P(ℓ) is given by Eq. (1), one ﬁnds hℓi = ζ(α), leading to the equation

17

τ = 2 + 2ζ(α) for θ = 1/2. As a result of this, one has

D0(α) =

Σ2

2 + 2ζ(α)

.

(28)

As in the α < 1 case, the agreement of the above results with the simulation results displayed

in Fig. 3 is excellent. Note that our choice to restrict the displacements along the backbone to

nearest-neighbor jumps between sites separated by one lattice spacing implies that one must take

Σ2 = 1. In the case of arbitrary θ, Eq. (28) must be replaced with the more general expression

D0(α) =

1 − θ

1 + 2θζ(α)

Σ2.

(29)

Finally, we can easily extend our results to the case where the boundary condition is the one used

in Sec. IV [recall that in this case a walker at the end of a tooth (y = ℓ) will always step back to

site y = ℓ − 1]. As already mentioned there, this boundary condition corresponds to treating a
tooth of length ℓ like a ring with 2ℓ sites. Correspondingly, one has tR(ℓ) = 2ℓ and τ = 1 + 2hℓi,
leading to D0(α) = Σ2/[1 + 2ζ(α)], or to D0(α) = Σ2/[1 + 2θ(1 − θ)−1ζ(α)] for θ 6= 1/2.

D. Case α = 1

For α = 1, the waiting time pdf given by (19) is simply ψ(t) ∼ ˆψ1 t−2, where ˆψ1 = 1 [or
ˆψ1 = θ/(1 − θ)]. For this speciﬁc form of waiting time pdf it is known that the MSD behaves as
follows [51]:

hx2(t)i ∼

Σ2

(30)

This result is again conﬁrmed by our numerical simulations (see the bottom curve in Fig. 2).

V.

INFLUENCE OF BINDING/UNBINDING KINETICS

Retardation effects associated with binding/unbinding kinetics in biological or biomimetic sys-

tems have been widely studied, notably by means of Monte Carlo simulations (see e.g. Refs. [52]

and [53]). In what follows, we shall study such effects for the particular case of the random comb

model.

In our simulations, we implemented binding/unbinding processes as follows. At a given time,

walkers at any site of the comb could be found in either of two states, namely, “bound” or “un-

bound”. Our collection of walkers was initially distributed at random along the x-axis, and all

18

of them were initially unbound. Subsequent transitions between the unbound state and the bound

state proceeded as follows. Whenever an unbound walker would jump to a nearest neighbor site, it

would bind to it with probability Kon (the time step was taken to be unity, thereby allowing one to
interpret Kon as a rate constant). In turn, walkers in the bound state could unbind with probability
Koff (rate constant for unbinding processes) when selected by the simulation algorithm, and they
were subsequently free to jump to a nearest neighbor site on the discretized comb.

At this stage, a comment on the physical origin of the above rate constants is in order. At

a mesoscopic level, one may regard Kon and Koff as effective parameters whose values are in
principle obtainable from experiments. However, one should bear in mind that a more microscopic

picture would bring molecular potentials between the diffusing molecules (“the walkers”) and the

biological matrix (“the comb”) into play. The latter approach is beyond the scope of the present

work and will not be further discussed here.

FIG. 6. Average fraction of bound particles E ≡ Nb/N as a function of κ.

The fraction of bound particles E = Nb/N can be interpreted as the normalized “binding
energy” E of the system. From the analysis of the corresponding kinetic equations this fraction

is expected to be E ∼ Kon/(Kon + Koff) in the long-time limit. As a result of this, the energy
should follow the law E = κ/(1 + κ), where κ ≡ Kon/Koff is the ratio of rate constants. This is
in full agreement with the simulation data displayed in Fig. 6 (see dots). Note that the value of E

is independent of the exponent α.

We now proceed to quantify the impact of the delay introduced by binding/unbinding events

on the diffusion coefﬁcient for the walker motion along the backbone. The MSD in the long time

regime hx2(t)i = Dκ(α)tγ deﬁnes the κ-dependent diffusion coefﬁcient. Numerical results for the
normalized effective diffusion coefﬁcient Dκ/D0 are shown in Fig. 7. Here, the effective diffusion
coefﬁcient D0 = D0(α) is the one deﬁned previously for the case where binding-unbinding events
are absent. As expected, the diffusion coefﬁcient is seen to decrease with increasing κ, i.e., with

increasing Kon. This can be explained as follows. A walker arriving at a new location either
remains in the unbound state with probability 1 − Kon (and is thus free to jump to a nearest
neighbor site), or else it becomes bound with probability Kon. In the ﬁrst case, the time required
by the walker to move to a neighboring site is one (in our units), whereas in the latter case the

average waiting time due to binding is K −1

off + 1 (i.e., K −1
off

time units to escape the binding state

and one additional time unit to perform the nearest neighbor jump). The average time between
consecutive nearest neighbor jumps then becomes (1 − Kon) · 1 + Kon · (K −1
off + 1) = 1 + κ.
Therefore, for the case with binding, the time required to perform a transition between neighboring

sites is increased by the factor (1 + κ) with respect to the case without binding. Hence, the MSD
hx2(t)i = D0tγ along the backbone becomes hx2(t)i = D0[t/(1 + κ)]γ in the presence of binding,
and consequently,

In Fig. 7, the plots of the analytical expression given by Eq. (31) (dashed curves) can be seen to be

in excellent agreement with numerical data from MC simulations results.

It should be noted that Eq. (31) can be understood as the extension to the anomalous diffusion

case of the computation for the effective diffusion coefﬁcient in the presence of binding/unbinding

processes that can be found in the literature for the standard diffusion case; see, e.g., Eq. (31)

in Ref. [40], which is recovered from Eq.

(31) when γ = 1. The effective diffusion regime

mentioned in Ref.

[40] turns out to be dominant in comb-like systems with α < 1, since it

corresponds to the case where the binding/unbinding reactions occur on a much shorter time scale

than transport along the backbone.

Finally, we also note that from the formula (31) one ﬁnds κ = (D0/Dκ)1/γ − 1, implying
that in the subdiffusive regime 0 < α < 1 knowledge of the normalized diffusion coefﬁcient is

not enough to infer the ratio of rate constants characterizing the binding/unbinding processes (to

calculate κ, one must additionally know the value of α). This is a key difference with respect to

the normal diffusion regime with α ≥ 1.

Conversely, in experiments where the parameters for the binding/unbinding processes do not

change, the value of the exponent α characterizing the comb geometry can only be determined if
γ ≤ 1. In such cases, knowledge of Dκ/D0 would still be insufﬁcient, since the value of κ is also
needed.

VI. FRAP DYNAMICS ON THE RANDOM COMB

Both the diffusion coefﬁcient D0(α) calculated in Sec. IV and its corrected value in the presence
of binding/unbinding events are expected to be useful for quantitative studies aiming at the charac-

terization of diffusive transport in comb-like biological structures, and notably in spiny dendrites

[34, 38, 49, 54, 55]. The ultimate goal is the comparison with experiments where representative

quantities depending on transport properties are monitored.

In the above context, FRAP experiments are a widely used technique to explore binding inter-

actions of membrane proteins in cells. For a comprehensive, up-to-date review on FRAP and other

microscopy techniques the reader is referred to [56]. As already mentioned in the introduction,

in FRAP experiments particles are stained with a ﬂuorescent dye and then those in a small region

(the “bleached spot”) are photobleached with a laser pulse. Following this, one measures the ﬂu-

orescent signal recovery as the bleached spot is progressively ﬁlled with particles diffusing from

the region outside the spot.

FRAP techniques are especially well-suited when transport processes are very slow and,

when a signiﬁcant portion of molecules is immobile, they appear to be more robust than other

21

ﬂuorescence-based techniques [56]. Nowadays, FRAP experiments are widely used to character-

ize in vivo protein motion [57], diffusion-controlled drug delivery [58] and morphogen transport

[59]. In these systems, diffusing proteins in the cell nucleus bind reversibly to the immobile nu-

clear structure. The cell nucleus may be considered to be a ‘crowded’ environment causing the

proteins to move subdiffusively on sufﬁciently long time scales.

From a theoretical point of view, a method aimed at reproducing FRAP recovery curves by

means of coupled reaction-diffusion equations was ﬁrst developed in Ref. [40] and subsequently

generalized in follow-up works [35, 36].

In Ref. [43], the solutions corresponding to a two-

dimensional geometry and a circular bleached spot were extended to the case where the diffus-

ing particles perform a subdiffusive CTRW rather than standard Markovian walks. Interestingly,

experimental recovery curves previously described by a normal diffusion model were found to be

equally well ﬁtted by a fractional diffusion equation arising from the CTRW model.

In the present section, we shall study the FRAP phenomenology in the random comb model.

To this end, we initially placed a collection of particles on the backbone, eliminated those of them

within a segment of the backbone (the bleached spot) and subsequently let the remaining ones

perform random walks according to the simulation procedure described below. The time evolution

of the number of unbleached particles inside the bleached spot and the associated concentration

recovery curves were computed numerically and shown to be reproducible by means of fractional

diffusion equations underlying the corresponding one-dimensional CTRW model. The mathemat-

ical treatment of the latter is similar to the one used in Ref. [43] for the two-dimensional case.

A. Simulation procedure

The simulations for the numerical computation of FRAP recovery curves were performed as

follows. We ﬁrst deﬁned a discretized comb with randomly distributed tooth length in y-direction

and a backbone in x-direction consisting of M lattice sites subject to periodic boundary conditions,

whereby the lattice spacing in x- and y-directions was chosen to be the same. Following this, N

non-interacting walkers were randomly scattered along the backbone, and all the walkers found

within a segment of length L < M lattice sites were then “bleached”, i.e., removed from the

system.

Following this, we let the walkers perform nearest-neighbor jumps and thereby spread through-

out the entire comb structure. We then monitored the time evolution of the average number of

22

walkers Nspot(t) found within a spot of size L or, more conveniently, the normalized average
number of walkers CL(t) dwelling inside the spot at time t:

CL(t) =

hNspot(t)i
hNspot(∞)i

.

(32)

The normalizing quantity hNspot(∞)i was easily obtained by taking into account that the mean
number of particles per unit length in the ﬁnal homogeneous state is the same as immediately after

the photobleaching, that is, (N −hNbli)/M = hNspot(∞)i/L, where Nbl is the number of bleached
particles. Thus, one ﬁnds hNspot(∞)i = (N − hNbli)(L/M).

B. Analytical and numerical results

The time evolution of CL(t) can be studied both analytically and numerically. Our subsequent
IV to successfully analyze diffusion on the

analysis relies on the CTRW approach used in Sec.

random comb. We have shown that particle spread along the backbone can be effectively described

by one-dimensional diffusion of CTRWers with a waiting time density ψ(t) given by Eq. (19) or,

equivalently, by Eq. (20). On the other hand, it is well known that in the long-time limit the

evolution of the concentration c(x, t) of such CTRWers obeys the following fractional diffusion

equation [47]:

stands for the so-called Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative.

Let us denote by c0 the value of the concentration c(x, t) before the bleaching. In what follows
we assume that our comb system extends from x = −M/2 to x = M/2, whereby the bleached

spot extends from x = −L/2 to x = L/2. We consider the case of perfect bleaching described by

the initial condition [40]

In the simulations, periodic boundary conditions are taken, i. e., c(x, t) = c(x+L, t). The solution

to the boundary value problem posed by Eqs. (33)- (34) and the periodic boundary condition is

Let us now examine the early-time behavior of CL(t). To this end, one can either look up the
relevant series expansion of the Fox function or take the limit s → ∞ (qγ → ∞) in Eq. (39). We
choose the second option. To leading order one ﬁnds

2. Finite system

Next, we turn to the study of ﬁnite size effects. For ﬁnite M and L/M < 1, the scaling behavior
of CL(t) versus the rescaled time (D0tγ)1/2/L is represented in Figs. 8 and 9 for the cases κ = 0
and κ > 0, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 8, ﬁnite size effects are important in both cases.

Both the exponent α and the typical lengths M and L determine the initial slope of the recovery

curves. For a given α and a given ﬁnite size ratio L/M recovery curves corresponding to different

values of L collapse approximately to a single curve (see Fig. 8). As shown below, this short-time

behavior can also be recovered analytically.

For early times we take the s → ∞ limit of Eq. (38) and ﬁnd

Thus, a log-log plot of the simulation curves for the inverse of the difference between the average

normalized concentration and its ﬁnal value (here normalized to one) as a function of time should

yield linear behavior with a slope equal to γ. Note the difference in behavior with respect to the
inﬁnite system [Eq. (46)], where the growth of [1 − CL,∞(t)]−1 is proportional to tγ/2. This means
that the limits M → ∞ and t → ∞ do not commute.

C. Non-reproducibility of concentration recovery curves with an approach based on scaled

Brownian motion

Diffusion equations with a time-dependent diffusion coefﬁcient (so-called scaled Brownian

motion (sBm) in the language of Ref. [2]) are often used to ﬁt in a rather successful way recovery

curves recorded in FRAP experiments [39, 42, 61]. The idea underlying this “ad-hoc” procedure is

to replace the diffusion coefﬁcient D ≡ K1 in the standard diffusion equation by a time-dependent
expression D′tγ−1, whereby D′ and γ are used as ﬁtting parameters. In Ref. [62], a word of caution

is given against the use of such approaches without the corresponding justiﬁcation at a microscopic

level of description. Even though sBm seems to work well in the speciﬁc case of FRAP recovery

curves, the lack of more detailed information on the elementary transport processes might lead to

wrong results if one attempts to compute other quantities.

How well does sBm work for our comb model? Since our CTRW-based exact solution is valid

for arbitrary values of γ, we can answer this question easily. In Fig. 10 we show a lin-log plot
of CL as a function of (Kγtγ)1/2/L for γ = 1/2 and also for the normal diffusion case γ = 1.
One can see that is not posible to fully match the recovery curve obtained from the CTRW model

simply by shifting horizontally the solution for the normal diffusion case, implying that a simple

substitution of the form D → D′tγ−1 in Eq. (41) cannot be used to reproduce the behavior of this
quantity in the CTRW case. For example, for values of CL larger than 1/2, say, it would be possible

27

to ﬁt the anomalous diffusion curves reasonably well by a proper shift of the normal diffusion

curve. However, this would worsen the agreement for CL < 1/2, i.e., the regime corresponding
to relatively short times. One can nevertheless see from the ﬁgure that the overall agreement is

not too bad. This could provide an empirical justiﬁcation for a heuristic “ﬁtting” procedure of

recovery curves based on sBm, especially for experimental comb-like systems characterized by an

effective value of γ close to 1.

with α = 0 (implying γ = 1/2, see solid curve), and (ii) the case where all the teeth are ﬁnite, i.e., the case of normal

diffusion with α > 1 (implying γ = 1, see dashed curve) and K1 ≡ D.

VII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In the present work we obtained an explicit analytical expression for the diffusion coefﬁcient

of a particle moving on a comb with randomly varying tooth lengths drawn from a power-law

distribution (random comb model). This was done by exploiting the well-known correspondence

of the comb model with the CTRW model, whereby the waiting time of the CTRWer was set

identical with the time needed by a particle diffusing on a tooth to reach the intersection with the

backbone and then move along it. The inﬂuence of binding/unbinding processes on the diffusion

coefﬁcient was also studied, and a scaling law in terms of the ratio of rate constants for both

processes was found. Transport properties are directly related to the speciﬁc geometry of the

substrate and to the strength and persistence of the binding interactions and could thus provide

28

relevant information about these properties. Hence, we expect the above results to be useful for

quantitative studies of diffusional transport in comb-like systems such as spiny dendrites. In order

to mimic these systems in a more realistic way, one could incorporate further sources of spatial

disorder into the system, e.g., spatial ﬂuctuations in the separation distance between consecutive

teeth. Work in this direction is underway.

Despite the approximations implied by the CTRW model, our analytic results for the diffusion

coefﬁcient are in remarkable agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. The analytic expression

for the diffusion coefﬁcient was subsequently used to study the behavior of relaxation curves for

FRAP processes implemented on the random comb. The agreement was also excellent in this

case in spite of the complete absence of free parameters. The situation studied corresponds to

the case in which all the particles were initially placed on the backbone and then some of them

were photobleached, as opposed to typical experiments in spiny dendrites, where some particles

are still found in the spines after photobleaching. However, no matters of principle prevent one

from implementing our initial condition in real experiments.

We also characterized the delay introduced by binding/unbinding processes in terms of a scaling

law involving both the ratio of rate constants κ and the exponent characterizing the statistical

properties of the random comb geometry α. Binding/unbinding effects have no inﬂuence on the

diffusion exponent, but they do change the diffusion coefﬁcient. Similarly, changes in α only have

an inﬂuence on the diffusion coefﬁcient. In contrast, for 0 < α < 1 small changes in α inﬂuence

both the diffusion exponent and the diffusion coefﬁcient.

As a result of the above, we conclude that the effect of binding/unbinding processes can be

mimicked by a change in the comb geometry only when α > 1. To this end, one needs to ﬁnd
a proper value of the decay exponent α′ so that D0(α′) = Dκ(α), where both α, α′ > 1. In
contrast, when 0 < α < 1, this is no longer possible, since the diffusion exponent is also affected,

i.e., γ ′ = (1 + α′)/2 6= (1 + α)/2 = γ. In this regime, changes in the geometry have a more

profound effect than changes in the binding properties of the system. In the ﬁrst case, the long

time dependence of the MSD is affected, and this should be clearly distinguishable in experiments.

Finally, we saw that one should be careful when using results based on standard diffusion equa-

tions to deal with anomalous diffusion problems. In our case, it was not possible to generate FRAP

dynamics on a random comb as given by the CTRW approach by simply replacing the diffusion co-

efﬁcient with a time-dependent one in the standard diffusion equation, albeit differences appeared

to be small in general. This emphasizes the need of dealing with anomalous diffusion problems by

29

means of bottom-up approaches relying on a solid basis at a microscopic level of description. In

this context, our CTRW approach can be straightforwardly extrapolated to study other problems

with different initial conditions, boundary conditions, and dimensionality.

APPENDIX A: FIRST PASSAGE PROBABILITY FOR ARBITRARY θ

In our route to the analytic expression for the ﬁrst-passage probability ψn(ℓ, θ) introduced in
Sec. IV B, we shall invoke some results obtained in the framework of the continuous-time for-

malism developed in Ref. [30]. We shall formulate the problem in continuous time by ﬁrst in-

troducing the probability densities ψ(t) ≡ ψ(t, ℓ) and U(t) ≡ U(t, ℓ). The passage to a for-
n−ǫ ψ(t)dt = ψn(ℓ) and

mulation in discrete time can be performed via the relations limǫ→0R n+ǫ
limǫ→0R n+ǫ

n−ǫ U(t)dt = Un(ℓ).

Let us denote by ϕ(t) the pdf for the waiting time between consecutive jumps. In the main text

we consider the case of jumps taking place at regular time intervals [ϕ(t) = δ(t − 1))] but the

results given below remain valid for an arbitrary pdf provided that its ﬁrst moment be ﬁnite. A

walker placed on the backbone, at (x = 0, y = 0), say, can reach either the left or the right nearest

neighbor site (x = ±1, y = 0) in many different ways: either directly by means of a single step

(an event which takes place with probability 1 − θ); or else the walker ﬁrst jumps upwards to site

(x = 0, y = 1) with probability θ, then returns to (x = 0, y = 0) after n − 2 steps (with probability
Un−2), and ﬁnally jumps to (x = ±1, y = 0) with probability 1 − θ; or else it ﬁrst jumps to site
(x = 0, y = 1) with probability θ, then returns to site (x = 0, y = 0) after n1 steps, then jumps
back again to site (x = 0, y = 1) , then returns to site (x = 0, y = 0) after n − 3 − n1 steps, and
ﬁnally performs the transition to a nearest neighbor site (x = ±1, y = 0); and so on. A detailed

30

bookkeeping of all these possibilities leads to the following equation [30]:

(52)

The multiple convolution structure of the terms on the right hand side suggests that switching to

Laplace space may be a convenient strategy; indeed, the Laplace transform of the above equation
takes a remarkably simple form, namely, ˜ψ(s) = (1 − θ) ˜ϕ(s)/[1 − θ ˜ϕ(s) ˜U (s)]. Correspondingly,
t ψ(τ )dτ, i.e., the probability
that the waiting time between two consecutive jumps along the backbone be longer than t takes

the Laplace transform of the so-called survival probability Ψ(t) =R ∞

the form

˜Ψ(s) =

1
s

θ ˜ϕ(s)[1 − ˜U (s)]
1 − θ ˜ϕ(s) ˜U (s)

.

(53)

Using the fact that ˜U(s) = cosh(ℓ + 1/2)ξ0/ cosh(ℓ + 3/2)ξ0 with cosh ξ0 = 1/ ˜ϕ(s) [30], and
taking into account that ξ0 = O(s1/2), Eq. (53) yields the following asymptotic behavior:

˜Ψ(s) ∼

θ

1 − θ

ξ0 sinh ℓξ0

s → 0.

(54)

One thus sees that, for a given θ 6= 1/2, the probability Ψ(t) is θ/(1 − θ) times its counterpart for
t ψ(τ ) dτ,

the case θ = 1/2. The same is true for the pdf ψ(t) because of the relation Ψ(t) =R ∞

whence Eq. (16) for the corresponding discrete-time probabilities follows.

APPENDIX B: SOLUTION OF THE FRAP PROBLEM IN LAPLACE SPACE

Since the initial condition (34) is symmetric with respect to the origin, the imposed peri-

odic boundary conditions are equivalent to zero-ﬂux boundary conditions, j(x = ±M/2, t) = 0,

whereby the ﬂux of the mobile species (whose divergence is given by the time derivative of the

concentration) takes the form

j(x, t) = −Kγ 0D1−γ

(55)

Hence, zero-ﬂux boundary conditions imply ∂c(x,t)

= 0. Given the symmetry of the

problem with respect to x = 0, one has c(x, t) = c(−x, t), and then it is simpler to solve the

∂x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=±M/2

31

equivalent problem in the half interval 0 ≤ x ≤ M/2, whereby the zero-ﬂux boundary condition

at x = −M/2 is replaced with the same boundary condition at x = 0, i.e.,

∂c(x, t)
