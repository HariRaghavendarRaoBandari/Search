Abstract

Using the linear T-dual ward identity associated with the NSNS gauge transfor-
mations, some RR couplings on Dp-branes have been found at order O(α′2). We
examine the C (p−1) couplings with the S-matrix elements of one RR, one graviton

and one antisymmetric B-ﬁeld vertex operators. We ﬁnd the consistency of T-dual

S-matrix elements and explicit results of scattering string amplitude and show that

the string amplitude reproduces these couplings as well as some other couplings. This
illustration is found for C (p−3) couplings in the literature which is extended to the
C (p−1) couplings in this paper.

Introduction

The dynamics of the D-branes of type II superstring theories at the lowest order in α′ is
given by the world-volume theory which is the sum of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Chern-
Simons (CS) actions [1, 2, 3, 4]. The bosonic part of this action is

S = −TpZ dp+1x e−φq− det (Gab + Bab) + TpZM p+1

eBC + · · ·

(1)

P8

where dots refer to the terms at higher order of α′. In the Chern-Simos part, M p+1 represents
the world volume of the Dp-brane, C is the sum over all RR potential forms, i.e., C =
n=0 C (n), and the multiplication rule is wedge product. It is understood here that after
expanding the exponential, in each term that particular C (n) is chosen such that the product
of forms adds up to a (p + 1)-form. The four form is self-dual and the electric components
of the redundant ﬁelds C (5), · · · , C (8) are related to the magnetic components of the RR
ﬁelds C (0), · · · , C (3) as dC (8−n) = ∗(dC (n)) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. The closed string ﬁelds Gab, Bab
and C are the pulled back of the bulk ﬁelds onto the world-volume of D-brane, e.g.,

Gab = Gµν

∂xµ
∂σa

∂xν
∂σb

(2)

where xi = 2πα′Φi in the static gauge. The transverse scalar ﬁelds appear in the D-brane
action also in the Taylor expansion of the closed string ﬁelds [5]. The abelian gauge ﬁeld
can be added to the action as B → B + 2πα′f . This makes the action to be invariant under
the B-ﬁeld gauge transformation. The Chern-Simons part is invariant under the following
RR gauge transformations:

δC = dΛ + H ∧ Λ

(3)

where H is the ﬁeld strength of B, i.e., H = dB, and Λ =P7

n=0 Λ(n).

The α′2 couplings of D-brane which involve the linear RR ﬁeld strengths F (p), F (p+2)
and F (p+4) have been found by studying the S-matrix elements of one RR and one NSNS
vertex operators [6]. These couplings for F (p+2) in the string frame are [10]:

couplings are invariant under the linear T-duality and the B-ﬁeld gauge transformations.

These quadratic couplings can be extended to higher order terms by making them
to be covariant under the coordinate transformations and invariant under the RR gauge
transformations (3). That is, the partial derivatives in that couplings should be replaced by

the covariant derivatives, the closed string tensors should be extended to the pull-back of
the bulk ﬁelds onto the world-volume of D-brane, the linear RR gauge ﬁeld strength should
be extended to the nonlinear ﬁeld strength ˜F (n) that is given as

˜F (n) = dC (n−1) + H ∧ C (n−3)

(5)

and the linear curvature tensor should be extended to the nonlinear curvature tensor R,

where the semicolons are used to denote the covariant diﬀerentiation.

The α′2 corrections to the D-brane action for one RR, one NSNS and one open string
NS states have been found from the low energy of the string amplitude [9, 13]. These
corrections for the RR ﬁeld strength F (p) are:

where it has been extended 2πα′f to gauge invariant B + 2πα′f combination 1.

The second term which involve the transverse scalar ﬁeld, are exactly reproduced by
the pull-back operator in (6) in the static gauge [13]. The ﬁrst term should be added to the
D-brane action at order α′2. Extending the ﬁrst coupling above to be covariant under the
coordinate transformations and invariant under the B-ﬁeld and RR gauge transformations,
one ﬁnds the following nonlinear couplings at order α′2:

π2α′2Tp

2!(p − 2)!Z dp+1x ǫa0···ap ˜F (p)

ija3···ap[2Raa0

ij;a(Ba1a2 + 2πα′fa1a2)].

(7)

We calculate the ﬁeld theory amplitudes by using the above couplings for the scattering of
one RR (p − 1)-form with three and two transverse index and two NSNS states at order α′2.
We then compare the results with low energy limit of string amplitudes at order α′2 and
corresponding T-dual multiplets that has been found in [13]. Using S-matrix method in
details, the amplitude of one RR (p − 3)-form with one transverse index, and two arbitrary
B-ﬁelds has been studied in [11]. Here we perform similar computation for the amplitude
of RR (p − 1)-form in details and show that all structures of this amplitude, regardless the
overall factor, can be produced by T-duality that has been found in [13].

1The B-ﬁeld gauge symmetry, however, is broken by some of the higher orders of B-ﬁeld. The higher
order terms which are coming from expanding ˜F , are either in terms of ﬁeld strength H or in terms of B.
The gauge symmetry is broken in the latter cases. The symmetry can be restored, however, in the terms
in which the two indices of the B-ﬁeld are world volume, by replacing B with B + 2πα′f [11]

2

It has been shown in [13] that the T-duality at linear order should appear in the am-
plitudes through the associated Ward identities. Scattering amplitude at any loop order
should satisfy the T-dual Ward identity. This classiﬁes the tree-level amplitudes into T-dual
multiplets. Each multiplet includes the scattering amplitudes which interchange under the
linear T-duality transformations.

An outline of the paper is as follows: In section 2.1, we examine the calculation of string
amplitude of one RR and two NSNS vertex operators in superstring theory. In section 2.2.1,
we perform the calculation in full details for C (p−1)
and expand the amplitude at low energy.
Regarding the low energy expansion of integral term in amplitude, we show that there is
neither contact term nor massless open string pole at order O(α′2) which is consistent with
the couplings (6). In section 2.2.2, we perform the same calculation for C (p−1)
. We ﬁnd
that the contact terms and the massless open string pole of the ﬁeld theory, which have
been found in [13], are reproduced exactly by this amplitude at order O(α′2). In fact, by
using the standard S-matrix method, we ﬁnd all elements of S-matrix in proposal case that
found by T-duality in [13].

Scattering amplitude

The S-matrix method is a very important tool in superstring theory to discover new cou-
plings between strings. In fact, a powerful technique for ﬁnding the low energy ﬁeld theory
of the string theory is to compare the scattering amplitudes of the ﬁeld theory with the
corresponding amplitudes in the string theory expanded at low energy. Therefor corrections
in ﬁeld theory might have been obtained in α′ by standard S-matrix method. A great deal
of eﬀort for the understanding of scattering amplitudes has been made [5].

The couplings in (6) can be conﬁrmed by the scattering amplitude of one RR and
two NSNS states. Corresponding S-matrix has been found by the T-duality in [13]. We
reproduce these coupling by explicit calculations of S-matrix. As we will see, the string
theory scattering amplitude at the low energy produces both massless open string and
closed string channels as well as some contact terms. The closed string channels dictate the
supergravity couplings in the bulk and the couplings of one RR and one NSNS states on
the brane. On the other hand, the open string channels and the contact terms dictate only
the couplings on the brane in which we are interested in this paper. In the next section,
we calculate the massless open string amplitude and the contact terms resulting from the
couplings in (6).

2.1 Field theory amplitude

The open string channels in the scattering amplitude of one RR, one graviton and one
B-ﬁeld in the ﬁeld theory is given by the following two Feynman amplitudes:

AA−pole = Va(εA

2 , A)Gab(A)Vb(A, εS

3 , ε1) + (2 ↔ 3)

where A is the gauge ﬁeld on the Dp-brane and

AΦ−pole = Vm(εS

2 , Φ)Gmn(Φ)Vn(Φ, εA

3 , ε1) + (2 ↔ 3)

(8)

(9)

where Φ is the scalar ﬁeld on the Dp-brane.
In these amplitudes and in all amplitudes
in this paper, the polarization of the RR ﬁeld is given by ε1 and the polarizations of the
graviton and B-ﬁeld are given by εS, εA respectively.

To simplify the calculation in ﬁeld theory, we assume that the RR potentials carry no
world volume indices. Then the only non-zero vertex Vb(A, εS, ε1) is given by the second
term of (7) for p = 3 and the vertex Vn(Φ, εA, ε1) arises from the second term in (7):

This amplitude is of order O(α′2) which has six momenta in the numerator and two momenta
in the denominator.

There are contact terms at this order which are coming from the ﬁrst term in (7) and

the ﬁrst term in (6). They are simpliﬁed to

We will compare this amplitude with the corresponding string amplitude in the next section.
We now turn to the string theory side and calculate the scattering amplitude of one RR,
one graviton and one B-ﬁeld vertex operators.

2.2 String theory amplitude

The calculation of three closed string scattering amplitudes has been studied in [8, 11, 12]
for a particular class of terms in the amplitude to conﬁrm some of the couplings resulting
from the consistency of the Chern-Simons action at order O(α′2) with the linear T-duality
transformations2.
In this work, however, we are interested in ﬁnding all couplings that
string theory produces for the RR potential C (p−1) which carries any world volume indices.

2The on-shell T-dual Ward identity at the linear order appears in the S-matrix elements. The T-duality
of the eﬀective action, however, must be oﬀ-shell. To study the T-duality at the most simple level, one
has to examine the compatibility of the eﬀective action with the linear T-duality. At the more advance
level, one has to extend the linear T-duality to full nonlinear T-duality[17]. The appropriate framework
for this part is the double ﬁeld theory formalism in which the ﬁelds depend both on the usual spacetime
coordinates and on the winding coordinates[18].

5

To calculate a S-matrix element, one needs to choose the picture of the vertex operators
appropriately. The sum of the superghost charge must be -2 for the disk level amplitude.
The tree level scattering amplitude of one RR and two NSNS states on the world-volume
of a Dp-brane has been studied in diﬀerent vertex pictures [8, 9, 11, 12]. We are interested
to evaluate the amplitude of one RR, one graviton and one B-ﬁeld in the picture that the
symmetry between two NSNS states is manifest from the beginning. Hence, we work in
(−1/2, −3/2) picture for RR state [15] and the two NSNS vertex operators in (0, 0) picture.
It has been shown that the ﬁnal result is independent of the choice of the picture.

We work in the RNS worldsheet formalism, with the closed string vertex operators being
constructed out of bosons X µ(z), X µ(¯z) and fermions ψµ(z), ψµ(¯z) as well as the picture
ghosts φ(z) and φ(¯z). We will now perform the computation for interested distribution of
picture.

The scattering amplitude is given by the following correlation function:

A ∼ < V (−1/2,−3/2)

RR

1 , p1)V (0,0)

N SN S(ε2, p2)V (0,0)

N SN S(ε3, p3) >

Using the doubling trick [6], explicitly we have:3

where the NSNS vertex operators include polarizations εi and momenta pi ,i = 2, 3.
The RR vertex operator has momentum p1 and antisymmetric polarization ε1. The indices
A, B, · · · are the Dirac spinor indices and P− = 1
2(1 − γ11) is the chiral projection operator,

where ǫ is the volume (p + 1)-form of the Dp-brane. Here the matrix Dµν is a diagonal
matrix that agrees with ηµν in directions along the brane (Neumann boundary conditions)
and with −ηµν in directions normal to the brane (Dirichlet boundary conditions). In this
notation, Dµi = −δµi, Dµa = δµa and thus Dµν = Vµν − Nµν.

After performing the correlators, we will remove the volume of SL(2, R) group which
is the conformal symmetry of the upper half z-plane [11, 12]. The amplitude (13) can be

where g’s are the correlators of X’s which can easily be performed using the standard
world-sheet propagators, and the correlator of ψ can be calculated using the Wick-like rule
[16].

If the symmetry of two NSNS polarizations are similar then ten independent bi con-
tribute to the amplitude as [11, 12]. Two NSNS polarizations in this work have diﬀerent
symmetry and sixteen independent bi contribute to the amplitude. By considering the re-
lations (14) and (16) in amplitude (15), one can ﬁnd that the scattering amplitude involves
the following trace of gamma matrices :

T (n, p, m) =

1

n!(p + 1)!

ε1ν1···νnǫa0···apA[α1···αm]Tr(γν1 · · · γνnγa0 · · · γapγα1···αm)

(17)

where A[α1···αm] is an antisymmetric combination of the momenta and/or the polariza-
tions of the NSNS states[11, 12]. The trace (17) can be evaluated for speciﬁc values of n. It

7

could be veriﬁed that the amplitude is non-zero only for n = p−3, n = p−1, n = p+1, n =
p + 3, n = p + 5. The case n = p − 3 is studied in [11] where the RR potential carries
transverse indices and [12] where the RR potential carries only world volume indices.

We are interested in the case n = p − 1. In this case the only RR potentials that lead
to non zero amplitudes are that carried zero, one, two and three transvers indices. In this
paper, we consider (ε(p−1)
)i. The result can easily be extended to
the RR n-form by contracting its indices with the world volume form. For the cases that we
will evaluate, the trace relation (17) gives non-zero result only for the following T (n, p, m):

)ij and (ε(p−1)

)ijk, (ε(p−1)

1

1

1

T (3, 4, 8)

T (2, 3, 6)

T (1, 2, 4)

So it could be concluded easily that b1, b2 and b3 in (16) have no contribution to the

amplitude. Let us begin with the RR potential (ε(p−1)

1

)ijk.

2.2.1 The amplitude of one RR (p − 1)-form with three transvers indices and

two NSNS.

For this RR potential n = 3, and from the relation n = p − 1 one gets p = 4. The trace
(17) is non-zero only for m = 8. It becomes

T (3, 4, 8) = 32

8!
3!5!

εijk
1 ǫa0···a4A[ijka0···a4]

(18)

where 32 is the trace of the 32 × 32 identity matrix. Since m = 8, only the ψ correlator

in b16 have non-zero contribution to the amplitude (13). The X correlator in b16 is

g16 = |z12|2p1·p2|z13|2p1·p3|z23|2p2·p3|z1¯2|2p1·D·p2|z1¯3|2p1·D·p3|z2¯3|2p2·D·p3

(19)

one can easily check that the integrand is invariant under the SL(2, R) transformation.
So we can map the results to disk with unit radius. To ﬁx this symmetry, we then set [7]
z1 = 0. The correlator b16 then becomes

|z2|2p1·p2|z3|2p1·p3(cid:16)1 − |z2|2(cid:17)p2·D·p2(cid:16)1 − |z3|2(cid:17)p3·D·p3

The amplitude for two graviton or two B-ﬁeld is zero.This amplitude has been found as

the second component of a T-dual multiplet (equation (15) in [13]).

The conservation of momentum is understood in all amplitudes in this paper. The

integral in the above amplitude is

(22)

To ﬁx completely the SL(2, R) symmetry, we then set [8] polar coordinates zi = rieiθi,
i = 2, 3. Since the integrant depends only on θ2 − θ3, one of the integrals can be explicitly
performed. To study the low energy limit of the amplitude (21), one has to expand I1 at
the low energy. We Taylor expand the integral in r2 and r3 using

The expansion of this integral is found in [11] in a restricted kinematic setup. Since the
amplitude considered in this paper has no massless pole in the u and v-channel and also

4In scattering theory, the number of momenta are related to the degree of α′, so one can expand the

integrals up to arbitrary degree of α′.

the kinematic factor εij
1 ǫa0···a5A[ija0···a5] does not have any term proportional to p2 ·p3 and
p2·D·p3 . So the integral in (21) has no u and v-channel poles. Hence, it is safe to restrict
the Mandelstam variables in (20) to u = v = 0. By these consideration the expansion (26)
is exactly equal to the results in [11].

All terms in the above expansion are closed string poles. This is consistent with the
ﬁeld theory calculation in the previous section that there is no massless open string channel
for (ε(p−1)

)ijk.

2.2.2 The amplitude of one RR (p − 1)-form with two transvers indices and two

NSNS.

In this case, n = 2 and from the relation n = p − 1, it could be found that p = 3. Since
the index of the RR potential is transverse and the indices of the volume form are the
world-volume indices, one ﬁnds that the trace relation (17) is non-zero only for m = 6. The
trace in this case becomes

The ψ correlators in b12, b13, b14, b15 and b16 have non-zero contributions. Using the on-

one can ﬁnd the X correlators corresponding to these bi’s , i.e., ,

It is obvious that the above amplitudes are non-zero for symmetric polarization tensor
3 . There are similar sub-amplitudes as above

εS
2 and antisymmetric polarization tensor εA
in the (2 ↔ 3) part of the amplitude (15) where the polarization tensors are εA

2 and εS
3 .

The above amplitudes produce structures which contain the contraction of p1 and
NSNS polarizations. In the world volume contraction of p1, the conservation of momentum
along the brane could be used to write p1·V ·ε in terms of p2·V ·ε and p3·V ·ε.

By using this consideration and on-shell condition, it could be found that the contraction
of momenta with corresponding NSNS polarizations in the transvers direction are not
independent structures, i.e.,

p2·N ·ε2 = −p2·V ·ε2

p3·N ·ε3 = −p3·V ·ε3

(30)

Therefor, the independent structures that contain the contraction of momentum and po-
larization are

p1·N ·ε2, p3·N ·ε2, p2·V ·ε2, p3·V ·ε2, p1·N ·ε3, p2·N ·ε3, p2·V ·ε3, p3·V ·ε3

using this fact that there is no momentum conservation in the transverse subspace.

We will see that there are some other contributions as pp and εε from b16. Let us

evaluate the only structures in the sub-amplitude A16 in (15) in details.

We ﬁnally will collect all terms come from all subamplitudes and will write them in

form of a ﬁnal amplitude.

The contractions which produce structure pε3 give the following contribution to the

The amplitude (37) satisﬁes the Ward identities associated with the symmetric and anti-

the RR gauge transformations when it combines with the amplitude (21), the amplitude of
the RR (p − 1)-form with one transverse index (see appendix) and RR (p − 1)-form with
any transverse index in which we are not interested in this work. This amplitude has been
found in [13] as the sum of the second and the ﬁrst components of the T-dual multiplets
A2 and A′

U and W have been deﬁned in[13] as U ≡ V I2 − NI3, W ≡ V I3 − NI2. Note that we
have used the identity (39) to write the above amplitude in terms of ﬁeld strength H.
The amplitude does not satisfy the Ward identity corresponding to the graviton unless one
rewrite the ﬁeld strength H in terms of εA. Therefor, one can not write the amplitude in

15

terms of ﬁeld strengths H and the curvature R. However, some of them can be written
as RH. Because the metric appears in the eﬀective action in the curvature tensor as well
as in contracting the indices and in the deﬁnition of the covariant derivatives, one can not
expect that all terms to be rewritten as RH.

To study the low energy limit of the amplitude, one has to expand I2 and I4 at the
low energy as well as I1 in (26). (Mapping the integrand in each of the integrals I2 and
I4 to unit disk and ﬁxing the SL(2, R) symmetry as in section 2.2.1). Taylor expansion
of integrals I4 in r2 and r3 using (23) and then the integrals over the radial coordinates
contain following inﬁnite sums

One can ﬁnd such inﬁnite sums for the integral I2. Using these sums, in the region of small
momenta the following expansions can be found for these integrals:

the expansions hold up to terms quadratic in momenta.
It is obvious from the above
expansions and the expansion (26) that I1, I2 and I3 have only closed string poles while
the integrals I4 and I7 have both open and closed poles. To ﬁnd the open pole amplitude
one has to consider the ﬁrst two terms in the second line and the last term in the third
line of (40). Hence, the amplitude (40) has the following massless open string pole at order
O(α′2):

The above string low energy result is exactly the ﬁeld theory open amplitude (13) provided
that the normalization factor of the string amplitude (40) is ﬁxed at (3iα′2Tp)/(4π2). How-
ever, the part of the third term in the third line and the third term in the second line of

3 )a1a2(cid:21) + (2 ↔ 3)

these contact terms contribute to the couplings (6) and (7). Therefor, by using the explicit
calculation of string theory disk amplitude and compare with corresponding ﬁeld theory
evaluation, we examine the S-matrix of one RR (p − 1)-form (with three and two transvers
indices) and two NSNS states and also their corresponding couplings. We illustrate the
consistency between T-duality and explicit calculation of string scattering. At ﬁrst, we
show that the S-matrix that produced by T-dual ward identity is reproduced by three
point amplitude and then we show this consistency between corresponding couplings. We
have performed the same steps for the case that the RR (p − 1)-form carry one transvers
index. We present this result in the appendix.

A The amplitude of one RR (p − 1)-form with one

transvers index and two N SN S

In this appendix we calculate three-point amplitude (15) for one RR potential (C p−1)i
and two NSNS states. This scattering amplitude is zero for two graviton or two B-ﬁeld
vertex operators. Using the same steps as in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, we ﬁnd this result by
explicitly calculating in (−3/2, −1/2)-picture. For this case, we have n = 1 and p = 2. The
trace (17) is non-zero only for T(1,2,4). The ψ correlators in b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12, b13, b14, b15
and b16 have non-zero contribution to the amplitude (13).

Using the explicit calculation, one can ﬁnd that the polarization of RR (p − 1)-form

with one transvers index appears in amplitude in the form of following RR structures:

,

(p·N ·ε1)µ
(p·V ·εS ·N ·ε1)µ
(p·N ·εA·N ·ε1)µ
(ε1·N ·εS ·V ·εA)µν
(ε1·N ·εA·V ·εS)µν

(εS ·N ·ε1)µν
(p·N ·εS ·N ·ε1)µ
(p·V ·εA·N ·ε1)µ

,
,

,
,

(ε1·N ·εS ·N ·εA)µν
(ε1·N ·εA·N ·εS)µν

where µ and ν are the world volume indices that contract with the volume (p + 1)-form
ǫ and µ 6= ν. We ﬁnd the amplitude for one graviton and one B-ﬁeld in terms of above RR
structures:

where n and m are the particle labels of the polarization tensors.

Using the SL(2, R) symmetry ﬁxing in [8], one ﬁnds the low energy expansion of the
integrals J , J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J12, J15 and J16, for the general setup. Considering the ex-
pansion of integrals I1, I2, I3, I4, I7 in the sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, it is clear that only
the integrals I4, I7, J1, J4, J3 have massless open pole as well as closed pole. The other
integrals have only closed pole. Using the open pole terms in the low energy expansion of
these integrals, one can ﬁnd the string open pole amplitude at low energy.

We ﬁnd the exact consistency between this amplitude and corresponding ﬁeld theory
amplitude. The amplitude (45) satisﬁes the NSNS ward identity; however, it dose not
satisfy the RR ward identity. It can easily be extended to the RR invariant amplitude by
including the amplitude of the RR (p − 1)-form with three, two and no transvers indices,
which the ﬁrst two cases has been found in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. In this work, we are
not interested in the case that the RR potential carry no transvers index. We then check
that this amplitude is exactly equal to the result of T-dual ward identity in [14].
