INCLUSION-EXCLUSION PRINCIPLES FOR CONVEX HULLS

AND THE EULER RELATION

ZAKHAR KABLUCHKO, G ¨UNTER LAST, AND DMITRY ZAPOROZHETS

Abstract. Consider n points X1, . . . , Xn in Rd and denote their convex hull
by Π. We prove a number of inclusion-exclusion identities for the system
of convex hulls ΠI := conv(Xi : i ∈ I), where I ranges over all subsets of
{1, . . . , n}. For instance, denoting by ck(X) the number of k-element subcol-
lections of (X1, . . . , Xn) whose convex hull contains a point X ∈ Rd, we prove
that

c1(X) − c2(X) + c3(X) − . . . + (−1)n−1cn(X) = (−1)dim Π

for all X in the relative interior of Π. This conﬁrms a conjecture of R. Cowan
[Adv. Appl. Probab., 39(3):630–644, 2007] who proved the above formula for
almost all X. We establish similar results for the number of polytopes ΠJ
containing a given polytope ΠI as an r-dimensional face, thus proving another
conjecture of R. Cowan [Discrete Comput. Geom., 43(2):209–220, 2010]. As a
consequence, we derive inclusion-exclusion identities for the intrinsic volumes
and the face numbers of the polytopes ΠI . The main tool in our proofs is
a formula for the alternating sum of the face numbers of a convex polytope
intersected by an aﬃne subspace. This formula generalizes the classical Euler–
Schl¨aﬂi–Poincar´e relation and is of independent interest.

1. Statement of results

1.1. Introduction. Let X1, . . . , Xn be a ﬁnite collection1 of points in Rd. Denote
its convex hull by Π:

Π := conv(X1, . . . , Xn) =( n
Xi=1

More generally, for any set I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} we write

λiXi : λ1, . . . , λn ≥ 0,

λi = 1) .

n

Xi=1

ΠI := conv(Xi : i ∈ I)

for the convex hull of the points Xi, i ∈ I.
In this paper, we are interested in
various inclusion-exclusion relations satisﬁed by the system of polytopes ΠI , where
I ranges over all subsets of {1, . . . , n}.

Recall that a polytope is a convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points. By deﬁnition, it is
convex and compact. The interior of a polytope P is denoted by int P . The relative
interior of a polytope P , denoted by relint P , is the interior of P with respect to its
aﬃne hull. For example, the relative interior of a point is this point itself. For these
and other standard deﬁnitions from convex geometry we refer to the monographs

2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation. Primary: 52A05; Secondary: 52A22, 52B11.
Key words and phrases. Convex hulls, inclusion-exclusion principle, Cowan’s formula, Euler

characteristic, Euler relation, polytopes, faces, intrinsic volumes.

tion”, etc. rather than “set”, “subset”, etc.

by Schneider [Sch14], Schneider and Weil [SW08], and Gr¨unbaum [Gr¨u03]. We
denote by Fk(P ) the set of k-dimensional (closed) faces of P , and by fk(P ) their
number. Let dim P be the dimension of P and write F•(P ) = ∪dim P
k=0 Fk(P ) for the
set of all faces of P including P itself. Of central importance for the present paper
is the classical Euler–Schl¨aﬂi–Poincar´e relation (see [SW08, page 626] or [Gr¨u03,
page 130]) which states that for every polytope P ,

(1)

(−1)dim F =

XF ∈F•(P )

dim P

Xk=0

(−1)kfk(P ) = 1.

1.2. Cowan’s formula. Recall that X1, . . . , Xn is a ﬁnite collection of points in
Rd, and additionally let X be any point in Rd. For k = 1, . . . , n denote by ck(X) the
number of k-element subcollections of (X1, . . . , Xn) containing X in their convex
hull:

(2)

ck(X) = #{I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : #I = k, X ∈ ΠI }.

Here, #B is the number of elements in a set B. Cowan [Cow07] proved that

(3)

(−1)k−1ck(X) =((−1)dim Π,

0,

if X ∈ (relint Π)\E,
if X /∈ relint Π,

n

Xk=1

where E is some “exceptional set” of codimension 2. Cowan also conjectured that,
in fact, the ﬁrst case of the formula holds for all X ∈ relint Π and proved this for
d = 2. Another proof of Cowan’s formula can be found in the book of Schneider
and Weil [SW08, p. 309–310], but there is again an exceptional set, namely the
union of all (d − 2)-dimensional aﬃne subspaces spanned by X1, . . . , Xn. Our ﬁrst
result conﬁrms Cowan’s conjecture for all d ∈ N.

Theorem 1.1. For any ﬁnite collection of points X1, . . . , Xn in Rd and for all
X ∈ Rd we have

(4)

n

(−1)k−1ck(X) =((−1)dim Π,
Xk=1

0,

if X ∈ relint Π,
if X /∈ relint Π.

This formula should be compared to the well-known inclusion-exclusion princi-

ples which state that for arbitrary subsets A1, . . . , An of a set Ω,

(5)

(6)

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}
X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1

1∩i∈I Ai = 1A1∪...∪An,

(−1)#I−1

1∪i∈I Ai = 1A1∩...∩An,

where 1B denotes the indicator function of a set B. In terms of indicator functions,
Cowan’s formula can be written as

(7)

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1

1ΠI = (−1)dim Π

1relint Π.

This is clearly analogous to (6) if we consider the convex hull as an analogue of the
union, and the interior of the convex hull with a “phase factor” (−1)dim Π as an
analogue of the intersection. The next theorem states a “dual” Cowan’s formula
which is analogous to (5).

Theorem 1.2. For any ﬁnite collection of points X1, . . . , Xn in Rd we have

(8)

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1(−1)dim ΠI

1relint ΠI = 1Π.

Given (4), we can obtain (8) by simple algebraic manipulations (M¨obius inver-
sion), see Section 3.2. The proof of (4) is non-trivial and will be given in Section 3.1.

1.3. Generalized Euler relation. The left-hand side of (4) looks very much like
the Euler characteristic, but it seems that the original proof of Cowan [Cow07] does
not establish any direct connection between his formula and the theory of additive
functionals. We will follow a diﬀerent method. Referring to Section 3.1 for more
details, we brieﬂy describe the essence of our approach. Consider a non-degenerate
simplex with n vertices located in some (n − 1)-dimensional linear space H. Deﬁne
an aﬃne map A : H → Rd by sending the vertices of the simplex to the points
X1, . . . , Xn. Then, the polytopes ΠI , I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, are the images of the faces
of the simplex. Passing to the preimages, we can interpret Cowan’s formula as
a statement about the intersections between the aﬃne subspace A−1(X) and the
faces of the simplex.

The following general fact (which may be of independent interest) is the main
ingredient of our proofs. Although it may be known, we were unable to ﬁnd it in
the literature.

Theorem 1.3. Let T be a polytope in Rm with non-empty interior int T . Let
L ⊂ Rm be an aﬃne subspace of dimension m − d. Denote by ak the number of
k-dimensional faces of T which are intersected by L, where k = 0, . . . , m. Then,

(9)

m

(−1)kak =((−1)d,
Xk=0

0,

if L ∩ int T 6= ∅,
if L ∩ int T = ∅.

In the special case L = Rm we have ak = fk(T ), the number of k-dimensional

faces of T , and the theorem reduces to the classical Euler relation (1).

Example 1.4. Consider a square ABCD and a line L passing through A and the
middle of the side BC. Then, a0 = 1 (vertex A), a1 = 3 (sides AB, AD, BC), and
a2 = 1. We have 1 − 3 + 1 = −1. Let L′ be the line passing through A and B.
Then, a′
3 = 1. We
have 2 − 3 + 1 = 0.

1 = 3 (sides AB, AD, BC), and a′

0 = 2 (vertices A and B), a′

If for every face F of the polytope L ∩ T there is a unique face G of the polytope
T such that G ∩ L = F , and if dim F = dim G − d, then (9) is a consequence
of the Euler–Schl¨aﬂi–Poincar´e relation (1) for the polytope L ∩ T . However, it is
easy to construct examples in which the uniqueness fails (for example, if L is a line
containing some vertex of T , m ≥ 2). Thus, the main problem is how to treat these
“non-general position” cases.

Our proof of Theorem 1.3 (which will be given in Section 2) is based on Groemer’s
extension of the Euler characteristic to the class of ro-polytopes. Our method can
be applied to obtain further results of the same type, for example the following one.
Recall that Fk(P ) is the set of k-dimensional faces of a polytope P .

Theorem 1.5. Let T1, T2 ⊂ Rm be two polytopes which touch each other, that is
(relint T1) ∩ (relint T2) = ∅ but T1 ∩ T2 6= ∅. Then,

(−1)k#{F ∈ Fk(T1) : F ∩ T2 6= ∅} = 0.

(12)

A somewhat related result is the Euler relation for face-to-face tessellations,
see [SW08, Eq. (14.65)], but it seems that this relation implies neither Theorem 1.3
nor Theorem 1.5.

1.4. Inclusion-exclusion principles for intrinsic volumes. It is possible to
generalize Cowan’s formula to the setting when we count convex hulls intersecting
certain aﬃne subspace F ⊂ Rd rather than convex hulls containing a given point
X. Let X1, . . . , Xn be a ﬁnite collection of points in Rd.
It will be convenient
to assume that the convex hull Π of these points has full dimension d. This is
not a restriction of generality because otherwise we could replace Rd by the aﬃne
hull of X1, . . . , Xn. Given an aﬃne subspace F ⊂ Rd and k = 1, . . . , n, denote by
ck(F ) the number of k-element subcollections of (X1, . . . , Xn) whose convex hull
intersects F , that is

ck(F ) = #{I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : #I = k, F ∩ ΠI 6= ∅}.

Theorem 1.6. Under the above assumptions,

(−1)k−1ck(F ) =((−1)d−dim F ,

0,

if F ∩ int Π 6= ∅,
if F ∩ int Π = ∅.

n

Xk=1

The above result reduces to Cowan’s formula if F is a point. In terms of indicator

variables, Theorem 1.6 can be written as follows:

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1

1{F ∩ΠI 6=∅} = (−1)d−dim F

1{F ∩int Π6=∅}.

The set of all r-dimensional aﬃne subspaces of Rd is denoted by AﬀGr(d, r)
and called the aﬃne Grassmannian. It is known that AﬀGr(d, r) carries a measure
µr (deﬁned up to a multiplicative constant) invariant with respect to the natu-
ral action of the isometry group of Rd; see [SW08, Chapter 5.1]. The intrinsic
volumes V0(K), . . . , Vd(K) of a compact convex set K ⊂ Rd satisfy the Crofton
formula [SW08, Theorem 5.1.1]

(13) Vr(K) =

(cid:1) Γ(cid:0) r+1

1{F ∩K6=∅}µd−r(dF ), r = 0, . . . , d,

where we used the same normalization for µr as in [SW08, Chapter 5.1].
Inte-
grating (12) over AﬀGr(d, d − r) with respect to µd−r(dF ), we obtain an inclusion-
exclusion principle for intrinsic volumes which generalizes the result of Cowan [Cow07]
who considered the case r = d.
Theorem 1.7. For any ﬁnite collection X1, . . . , Xn of points in Rd with dim Π = d
and for every r = 0, . . . , d, we have

(14)

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1Vr(ΠI ) = (−1)rVr(Π).

Remark 1.8. Using the local Crofton formula [SW08, Theorem 5.3.3] one can prove
a similar identity for the curvature measures of the ΠI ’s.

INCLUSION-EXCLUSION PRINCIPLES

5

As in the work of Cowan [Cow07], it is possible to obtain probabilistic corollaries
of the above deterministic results. Let X1, . . . , Xn be random vectors with values
in Rd. We call (X1, . . . , Xn) an exchangeable tuple if for every permutation σ of
{1, . . . , n}, the distributional equality

(15)

(X1, . . . , Xn) d= (Xσ(1), . . . , Xσ(n))

holds. For example, this condition is satisﬁed if X1, . . . , Xn are independent identi-
cally distributed random vectors; see [Cow07] for more examples. Given any subset
I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} with #I = k write

vr(k) := EVr(ΠI ) = EVr(conv(X1, . . . , Xk)),

where we stress that by exchangeability, there is no dependence on the choice of I.

Theorem 1.9. Let (X1, . . . , Xn) be an exchangeable tuple of random vectors in Rd
such that dim Π = d a.s. Let r ∈ {0, . . . , d} and assume that EVr(Π) < ∞. Then,

(−1)k−1(cid:18)n

k(cid:19)vr(k) = (−1)rvr(n).

Remark 1.10. Condition EVr(Π) < ∞ holds provided that E|X1|r < ∞. This
follows from the fact that Π is contained in the ball of radius |X1| + . . . + |Xn|
centred at the origin together with the monotonicity (see (13)) and the homogeneity
of the intrinsic volumes.

Proof of Theorem 1.9. By the monotonicity of the intrinsic volumes, our assump-
tion EVr(Π) < ∞ implies that vr(k) < ∞ for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Taking the

expectation in (14) and noting that there are (cid:0)n

obtain the result.

k(cid:1) subsets I with k elements, we

(cid:3)

In the case r = d, Theorem 1.9 reduces to the well-known identity of Buchta [Buc90];

see also [SW08, Theorem 8.2.6] and [Aﬀ88a, Aﬀ88b, Bad89, Cow07, BR15, Buc86].

1.5. Inclusion-exclusion principles for faces. Next we are going to state inclusion-
exclusion principles for the faces of the polytopes ΠI , I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}. These de-
terministic formulas will be used to prove probabilistic identities (conjectured by
Cowan in [Cow10]) on the expected face numbers of random convex hulls.

Fix some ﬁnite collection of points X1, . . . , Xn in Rd. For a set I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}
denote by bj(I) the number of j-element sets J ⊃ I such that ΠI is a face of ΠJ ,
that is

bj(I) = #{J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : J ⊃ I, #J = j, ΠI is a face of ΠJ }.

Theorem 1.11. Consider a non-empty subset I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} such that2 ΠI ∩
(Xk : k /∈ I) = ∅. Then,

(16)

n

Xj=#I

(−1)j−1bj(I) =((−1)dim Π+#I−1−dim ΠI ,

0,

if ΠI is not a face of Π,
if ΠI is a face of Π.

The above assumption on I is always satisﬁed if #I = 1 (that is, if ΠI is a
single point) and the points X1, . . . , Xn are distinct. The following example shows
that (16) may fail in general.

2We write (Xk : k /∈ I) rather than {Xk : k /∈ I} because the points need not be distinct.

6

ZAKHAR KABLUCHKO, G ¨UNTER LAST, AND DMITRY ZAPOROZHETS

Example 1.12. Consider the points Xi = i, i = 1, . . . , 5, on the real line and
take I = {2, 4}. Clearly, ΠI = [2, 4] is a face of ΠJ if and only if J = {2, 4}
or J = {2, 3, 4}. Thus, b1(I) = b4(I) = b5(I) = 0 and b2(I) = b3(I) = 1. The
alternating sum in (16) equals 0, so that (16) fails.

In order to state a version of Theorem 1.11 not requiring additional assumptions

on I, we have to introduce the following modiﬁed version of bj(I):

b∗
j (I) = #{J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : J ⊃ I, #J = j, ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ },

where the word “clean” means that ΠI ∩ (Xk : k ∈ J\I) = ∅.

Theorem 1.13. For every non-empty subset I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} we have

(17)

n

Xj=#I

(−1)j−1b∗

j (I) =((−1)dim Π+#I−1−dim ΠI ,

0,

if ΠI is not a face of Π,
if ΠI is a face of Π.

Under the assumption ΠI ∩ (Xk : k /∈ I) = ∅ the conditions “ΠI is a face of ΠJ ”
and “ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ ” become equivalent which means that Theorem 1.13
contains Theorem 1.11 as a special case.

Example 1.14. Continuing Example 1.12, we see that ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ
if and only if J = I = {2, 4}. Hence, all b∗
2(I) = 1,
and (17) holds.

j (I) equal zero except for b∗

We say that a ﬁnite collection X1, . . . , Xn of points in Rd is in r-general position
for some r ∈ {1, . . . , d} if every r-dimensional aﬃne subspace contains at most
r + 1 points from this set. Recall that fr(P ) = #Fr(P ) denotes the number of
r-dimensional faces of a polytope P . The next result is a deterministic counterpart
of a probabilistic formula conjectured by Cowan [Cow10]. We obtain it by summing
up (16) over all subsets I with #I = r + 1; see Section 3.5 for details.

Theorem 1.15. Fix some d ∈ N and r ∈ {1, . . . , d}. Let X1, . . . , Xn be a ﬁnite
collection of points in r-general position in Rd and suppose that dim Π = d. Then,

(18)

X∅6=J⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#J−1fr(ΠJ ) = (−1)d(cid:18)(cid:18) n

r + 1(cid:19) − fr(Π)(cid:19) .

In particular, if n − d is odd, then the term fr(Π) appears on both sides with

diﬀerent signs, and we obtain the relation

2fr(Π) =(cid:18) n

r + 1(cid:19) + (−1)n X∅6=J({1,...,n}

(−1)#J−1fr(ΠJ ),

where we stress that the term with J = {1, . . . , n} is excluded from the summation.
If n − d is even, then the term fr(Π) cancels and we obtain

X∅6=J({1,...,n}

(−1)#J−1fr(ΠJ ) = (−1)d(cid:18) n

r + 1(cid:19).

Passing to the random setting, we prove a formula which was conjectured by
Cowan [Cow10] and proved by him in some special cases using the Dehn–Sommerville
relations. Let (X1, . . . , Xn) be an exchangeable tuple of random vectors in Rd;
see (15). For an arbitrary subset I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} with #I = k we write

Fr(k) := Efr(ΠI ) = Efr(conv(X1, . . . , Xk))

Theorem 1.16. Fix some d ∈ N and r ∈ {1, . . . , d}. Let (X1, . . . , Xn) be an

1.6. A proof of Buchta’s identity. Several remarkable identities for random
convex hulls were discovered by Buchta in [Buc05]. One of these identities has a
form very similar to the inclusion-exclusion principles studied in the present paper.
Given that Theorems 1.9 and 1.16 have deterministic counterparts, it is natural to
ask whether something similar is true for Buchta’s identity.

To state Buchta’s identity, let X1, . . . , Xn be independent identically distributed
random vectors in Rd. The probability distribution of Xi is denoted by µ and
assumed to be non-atomic (which implies that X1, . . . , Xn are distinct a.s.). Denote
by Nn = f0(Π) the number of vertices of Π and write

Mj := µ(conv(X1, . . . , Xj))

for the so-called probability content of conv(X1, . . . , Xj). Buchta’s identity [Buc05]
(see also [SW08, Theorem 8.2.5]) states that for every l = 1, . . . , n,

(19)

P[Nn = l] = (−1)l(cid:18)n

l(cid:19) l
Xj=1

(−1)j(cid:18)l

j(cid:19)EM n−j

.

If µ is the uniform distribution on some convex body K ⊂ Rd, then Mj is just
the volume of conv(X1, . . . , Xj) divided by the volume of K. Below we provide a
“pointwise” version of (19) which turns out to be a very simple inclusion-exclusion
formula. Our proof is diﬀerent from the original proof of Buchta [Buc90] (see
also [SW08, Theorem 8.2.5]).

Proof of (19). Denote the probability space on which X1, . . . , Xn are deﬁned by
(Ω, F, P). Let A1, . . . , An ∈ F be random events to be speciﬁed later and denote by
Ac

i = Ω\Ai the complement of Ai. Start with the inclusion-exclusion principle

where J = ∅ is allowed in the summation and the intersection over an empty index
set is Ω. Let now Ai be the random event {Xi is a vertex of Π}, for i = 1, . . . , n.
Recall that F0(Π) denotes the set of vertices of Π. Then, (20) becomes what can
be considered as a pointwise version of Buchta’s identity

(21)

1{F0(Π)={X1,...,Xl}} = XJ⊂{1,...,l}

(−1)l−#J

1{Xi,i /∈J, are not vertices of Π}.

Taking the expectation on both sides of (21) yields (19) because by exchangeability,

P[Nn = l] =(cid:18)n

l(cid:19)E1{F0(Π)={X1,...,Xl}}

and for every J ⊂ {1, . . . , l} with #J = j,

P[Xi, i /∈ J, are not vertices of Π] = P[{Xi : i /∈ J} ⊂ conv(Xk : k ∈ J)]

= E[M n−j

j

].

To prove the latter identity note that the conditional probability that {Xi : i /∈
J} ⊂ conv(Xk : k ∈ J) given {Xk : k ∈ J} equals M n−j
. Unlike most proofs of
the present paper, the above argument is almost purely combinatorial and does not
rely on topological notions like the Euler characteristic.

2. Proof of the generalized Euler relation

In this section we prove Theorems 1.3 and 1.5. First we need to recall some facts
about the extension of the Euler characteristic to the class of ro-polyhedra which
is due to Groemer [Gro72]; see also [SW08, Chapter 14.4].

2.1. Euler characteristic for ro-polyhedra. A ro-polytope is deﬁned as a rela-
tive interior of some polytope. Finite unions of ro-polytopes are called ro-polyhedra.
It is known (see [Gro72] or [SW08], page 625, Theorem 14.4.5) that there is a unique
function χ (the Euler characteristic) deﬁned on the family of ro-polyhedra in Rm
and having the following properties:

(a) χ(∅) = 0.
(b) χ is additive, that is χ(M ∪ N ) = χ(M ) + χ(N ) − χ(M ∩ N ) for all ro-

polyhedra M and N .

(c) For a non-empty polytope P we have χ(P ) = 1 and χ(relint P ) = (−1)dim P .

For the proof of the following lemma we refer to Theorem 14.4.1 in [SW08].

Lemma 2.1. If A1, . . . , As ⊂ Rm are ro-polyhedra such that Ps

some a1, . . . , as ∈ Z, then

i=1 ai1Ai = 0 for

s

aiχ(Ai) = 0.

Xi=1

2.2. Proof of Theorem 1.3. Recall that Fk(T ) denotes the set of k-dimensional
faces of the polytope T and F•(T ) = ∪m
k=0Fk(T ) is the set of all faces of T . Note
that Fm(T ) has exactly one element, namely T itself.

We can represent the polytope T as a disjoint union of its relatively open faces:

(22)

T = ∪G∈F•(T ) relint G.

It was observed by Nef [Nef81] that together with the properties of χ this immedi-
ately implies the Euler relation:

1 = χ(T ) = XG∈F•(T )

χ(relint G) = XG∈F•(T )

(−1)dim G.

The proof of Theorem 1.3 is more involved. A well-known corollary of the Euler
relation, see [SW08, p. 627, Eq. (14.64)] or [Gr¨u03, page 137], states that for every

vanishes). As for the right-hand side of (24), any term χ(F ∩ L) is either zero (if

3. Proofs of the inclusion-exclusion formulas

3.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Without loss of generality we assume that dim Π =
d, otherwise we could replace Rd by the aﬃne hull of X1, . . . , Xn. Deﬁne a linear
operator A : Rn → Rd by

Ae1 = X1, . . . , Aen = Xn,

where e1, . . . , en is the standard basis of Rn. Consider the standard (n − 1)-
dimensional simplex

S := {(α1, . . . , αn) ∈ [0, ∞)n : α1 + . . . + αn = 1} ⊂ Rn.

The (k − 1)-dimensional faces of S have the form

Si1,...,ik = {(α1, . . . , αn) ∈ S : αi = 0 for all i /∈ {i1, . . . , ik}},

where 1 ≤ i1 < . . . < ik ≤ n and k ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The next lemma provides an
interpretation of Cowan’s formula as a statement about the number of faces of the
simplex S intersected by the aﬃne subspace A−1(X). A somewhat related idea was
used in [KVZ15].

Lemma 3.1. For a point X ∈ Rd and any 1 ≤ i1 < . . . < ik ≤ n the following
statements are equivalent:

(i) X ∈ conv(Xi1 , . . . , Xik )
(ii) A−1(X) ∩ Si1,...,ik 6= ∅.

Proof. The set A−1(X)∩Si1,...,ik is non-empty if and only if there exist (α1, . . . , αn) ∈
S such that αi = 0 for all i /∈ {i1, . . . , ik} and

But in view of the deﬁnition of A this means that

A(α1e1 + . . . + αnen) = X.

αi1 Xi1 + . . . + αik Xik = X,

which is equivalent to X ∈ conv(Xi1 , . . . , Xik ).

(cid:3)

We proceed to the proof of Theorem 1.1. Fix some X ∈ Rd. We are going to
apply Theorem 1.3 to the polytope T := S located in the hyperplane H : α1 + . . . +
αn = 1 (which we identify with Rn−1, so that m = n − 1) and the aﬃne subspace
L := A−1(X) ∩ H.

We argue that the codimension of L in the hyperplane H equals d. Recall that
we assume that Π = conv(X1, . . . , Xn) has full dimension d. Hence, the vectors
X2 − X1, . . . , Xn − X1 span the whole Rd. This means that for every x ∈ Rd there
is a real solution (v2, . . . , vn) to v2(X2 − X1) + . . . + vn(Xn − X1) = x. Deﬁning
v1 = −(v2 + . . . + vn) and v = (v1, . . . , vn) we obtain a solution v to Av = x in
the hyperplane H0 : v1 + . . . + vn = 0. We have AH0 = Rd, hence AH = Rd and
therefore L = A−1(X) ∩ H has codimension d in H.

By Lemma 3.1, ck(X) deﬁned in (2) equals ak−1, the number of (k−1)-dimensional

faces of S which are intersected by L. Hence, by Theorem 1.3 we obtain that

(−1)k−1ck(X) =

n

Xk=1

It remains to prove that L ∩relint S 6= ∅ if and only if X ∈ relint Π. Indeed, X is
in the relative interior of conv(X1, . . . , Xn) if and only if there is a strictly positive

(−1)jaj =((−1)d,

tuple (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ S such that α1X1 + . . . + αnXn = X; see [Sch14, Theorem
1.1.14]. But this is equivalent to (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ L ∩ relint S.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1.2. Applying Theorem 1.1 in its indicator functions
version (7) to every ΠI and interchanging the order of summation, we obtain

X∅6=I⊂{1,...,n}

(−1)#I−1(−1)dim ΠI

otherwise.

3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.6. We can assume that F is a proper aﬃne subspace
because the case when F is a point was treated in Theorem 1.1, while the case
F = Rn reduces to the identity

k(cid:19) = 1.

Since the problem is invariant under simultaneous translations of X1, . . . , Xn
and F , we can assume that F contains the origin. Denote by S : Rd → F ⊥
the projection on F ⊥, the orthogonal complement of F . The idea is to apply
Cowan’s formula (4) to the projected points S(X1), . . . , S(Xn). Note that for any
set I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} the convex hull of (Xi : i ∈ I) intersects F if and only if the
convex hull of (S(Xi) : i ∈ I) contains the origin. This is true since convex hulls
are preserved under linear maps. We obtain

if 0 /∈ relint S(Π),

where the last step is by Theorem 1.1 applied to the points SX1, . . . , SXn ∈ F ⊥.
To complete the proof, note that the origin is in the relative interior of S(Π) =
conv(S(X1), . . . , S(Xn)) if and only if F intersects the interior of Π. This is true
because the projection of the interior of Π is the relative interior of S(Π).

3.4. Proof of Theorem 1.13. The idea is as follows: we will show that, essentially,
ΠI is a face of ΠJ if and only if the aﬃne subspace spanned by ΠI is not intersected
by ΠJ\I . After that, we can apply Theorem 1.6.

Denote by aﬀ B the aﬃne hull of a collection of points B.

Lemma 3.2. For non-empty sets I ⊂ J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} the following two conditions
are equivalent:

(i) ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ
(ii) aﬀ(Xi : i ∈ I) ∩ conv(Xk : k ∈ J\I) = ∅.

Proof of (i) ⇒ (ii). Let ΠI be a clean face of ΠJ . By the deﬁnition of a face, there
is an aﬃne hyperplane H separating Rd into two closed half-spaces H+ and H− such
that H ∩ΠJ = ΠI and ΠJ ⊂ H+. Since ΠI is clean, we have ΠI ∩(Xk : k ∈ J\I) = ∅
and, consequently, H ∩ (Xk : k ∈ J\I) = ∅.
It follows that (Xk : k ∈ J\I) is
contained in the interior of H+. Hence, conv(Xk : k ∈ J\I) does not intersect H.
Since aﬀ(Xi : i ∈ I) is a subset of H, we obtain (ii).
(cid:3)

Proof of (ii) ⇒ (i). We argue by contradiction. First we assume that ΠI is not
a face of ΠJ . Then we can represent some point of ΠI as a non-trivial convex
combination of two points from ΠJ such that at least one of the points is not
contained in ΠI . That is, we have

Xi∈I

αiXi = λXk∈J

βkXk + (1 − λ)Xk∈J

γkXk,

where λ ∈ (0, 1), and (αi)i∈I , (βk)k∈J , (γk)k∈J are collections of non-negative

numbers summing up to 1. Moreover, we can assume that, say, Pk∈J βkXk /∈ ΠI .

This implies that for at least one k0 ∈ J\I we have βk0 > 0. Then, we can write

1

C Xi∈I

(αi − λβi − (1 − λ)γi)Xi = Xk∈J\I

λβk + (1 − λ)γk

C

Xk,

where C := Pl∈J\I (λβl + (1 − λ)γl) > λβk0 > 0. The left-hand side belongs

to aﬀ(Xi : i ∈ I), whereas the right-hand side belongs to conv(Xk : k ∈ J\I),
In fact, condition (ii) implies that
a contradiction. Hence, ΠI is a face of ΠJ .
ΠI ∩ (Xk : k ∈ J\I) = ∅, hence ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ .
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.13. Without loss of generality, we assume that the aﬃne hull
of (X1, . . . , Xn) is Rd (equivalently, dim Π = d). Otherwise, consider this aﬃne hull
instead of Rd. For a non-empty set I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} write

S∗(I) = {J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : J ⊃ I, ΠI is a clean face of ΠJ }.

Let L = LI be the aﬃne hull of {Xi : i ∈ I}. Consider

S(I) = {J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} : J ⊃ I, ΠI is a face of ΠJ }.

The conditions we imposed on X1, . . . , Xn imply that every r-dimensional face of
ΠJ must have a form ΠI for a unique I ⊂ J with #I = r + 1. Using Theorem 1.11,
we get
