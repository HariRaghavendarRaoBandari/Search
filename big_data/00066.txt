A non-commuting measurement transfers, via the apparatus, information encoded in a system’s state to
the external “observer”. Classical measurements determine properties of physical objects. In the quan-
tum realm, the very same notion restricts the recording process to orthogonal states as only those are
distinguishable by measurements. Therefore, even a possibility to describe physical reality by means of
non-hermitian operators should volens nolens be excluded as their eigenstates are not orthogonal. Here,
we show that non-hermitian operators with real spectrum can be treated within the standard framework of
quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we propose a quantum canonical transformation that maps hermitian
systems onto non-hermitian ones. Similar to classical inertial forces this transformation is accompanied
by an energetic cost pinning the system on the unitary path.

Introduction. The no-cloning theorem states that un-
known quantum states cannot be copied [1], since no mea-
surement can distinguish arbitrary states with certainty.
Similarly, the unitary transfer of information from a quan-
tum system to the measuring device – apparatus – cannot
distinguish between non-orthogonal states [2, 3]. In con-
trast, all physical properties of classical systems can be de-
termined with arbitrary precision as the recording process
does not perturb the system. To put it differently, classical
measurements do not involve any back-action.

Those profound facts rely on a rather natural assumption
regarding the physical world – the repeatability of measure-
ments. The latter requires that consecutive measurements
should result in the same outcome. Consequently, the de-
mand for all physical observables to be hermitian seems to
be justiﬁed from the “ﬁrst principles” [3]. Therefore, even
a possibility to represent observables using non-hermitian
operators should volens nolens be excluded as their eigen-
states are non-orthogonal [4].

Nevertheless, a variety of experimental ﬁndings can
be explained by means of non-hermitian operators. For
instance, a spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in
Ref. [5, 6] has been linked to PT -symmetry, a condition
weaker than hermiticity [7]. Here P and T denote the
parity and time reﬂection, respectively, and PT -symmetry
guaranties that [PT , H] = 0, where H is the system’s
Hamiltonian. Additionally, exceptional eigenenergies of
complex value have also been measured [8]. Recent years
have witnessed great theoretical progress towards the un-
derstanding of as such non-hermitian systems [4]. It has
been shown, for example, that conventional quantum me-
chanics can be extended to the complex domain [9]. In-
teresting examples are optical systems with complex index
of refraction [10], tilted optical lattices with defects [11] or
systems undergoing topological transitions [12, 13]. The
latter can serve as realizations of PT -symmetry in Bose-
Einstein condensates [14]. Also, many breakthroughs in

thermodynamics and statistical physics have been reported
for non-hermitian systems. The Jarzynski equality [15] or
the Carnot bound [16] may serve as good examples [7, 17].
It is only natural to ask whether such theories are funda-
mental or provide only an effective (e.g. open systems with
balanced loss and gain [5]) description of nature [18]. In
this Letter we show that the requirement to be able to repeat
measurements does not exclude all non-hermitian “observ-
ables” from the description of physical reality. We will
prove that the non-hermitian observables with real spec-
trum are as physical as their hermitian counterparts.
In
fact, a formal correspondence between the two classes can
be established by means of a quantum canonical transfor-
mation [19]. To put it differently, non-hermitian operators
provide a convenient way of representing quantum systems
in a physically equivalent way [20, 21]. This situation is
completely analogous to classical mechanics where classi-
cal canonical transformations are used to simplify Hamil-
ton’s equations of motion [22].
Repeatability of quantum measurements. Let H be a
non-hermitian observable, i.e. H† (cid:54)= H. Without loss
of generality we assume that H is the Hamiltonain of a
quantum system. To be physically relevant H needs to be
at least diagonalizable. This requirement assures the exis-
tence of an orthonormal basis, {|En(cid:105)} with corresponding
eigenenergies, En, that can be measured. For the sake of
simplicity, we further assume that the energy spectrum is
discrete and non-degenerate. Therefore, we can write [23]

V −1HV =

En |En(cid:105)(cid:104)En| , En ∈ C,

(1)
where (cid:104)En|Em(cid:105) = δnm. Generally, H is non-hermitian,
and thus the similarity transformation V is not unitary, i.e,
V † (cid:54)= V −1. Let us rewrite Eq. (1) as

(cid:88)

n

(cid:88)

n

H =

En |ψn(cid:105)(cid:104)φn| ,

(2)

that is, (cid:104)φn|ψm(cid:105) = δnm and I =(cid:80)

where |ψn(cid:105) := V |En(cid:105) and (cid:104)φn| := (cid:104)En| V −1. By con-
struction, these states form a biorthonormal basis [7, 24],
n |ψn(cid:105)(cid:104)φn|. Moreover,

the eigenvalue problem for H can be stated as

2

.

(cid:104)φn| H = En (cid:104)φn| .

H |ψn(cid:105) = En |ψn(cid:105) ,

(3)
As a result, the left (cid:104)φn| corresponds to the right |ψn(cid:105) in
Dirac notation [25]. Hence, the way the probability is as-
signed to a physical process has to be revisited. For in-
stance, consider a system that is prepared in one of its en-
ergy eigenstates, say |ψn(cid:105), and then immediately perturbed
by a map U (e.g. time evolution or a measurement). Then
the probability to measure energy Em reads

pnm = p(|ψn(cid:105) → U → |ψm(cid:105)) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)φm| U |ψn(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

(4)
This formula provides a natural generalization of the “stan-
dard” recipe, |(cid:104)ψm| U |ψn(cid:105)|2, for calculating probabilities
in hermitian quantum mechanics [25].

It is important to realize that non-hermitian operators
such as in Eq. (1) can generate unitary dynamics. This is
possible if and only if the energy spectrum is real. There-
fore, a priori, non-hermitian operators do not necessar-
ily violate the conservation of probability. Note, not only
every superposition of states |ψn(cid:105) is allowed but also an
arbitrary state |ψ0(cid:105) can be expressed in such a manner,
n |cn|2 = 1 and |cn|2 is
the probability for the system to be found in its eigenstate
|ψn(cid:105). The corresponding (cid:104)φ0| is given by

n cn |ψn(cid:105), where (cid:80)
(cid:88)

|ψ0(cid:105) = (cid:80)

(5)
The initial state |ψ0(cid:105) evolves under the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, i∂t |ψt(cid:105) = H |ψt(cid:105). Therefore, the solution reads
cn |ψn(cid:105), and, as a consequence of
Eq. (5), the corresponding (cid:104)φt| evolves according to

|ψt(cid:105) = (cid:80)

Thus, if and only if all eigenvalues En are real then the

proving that the probability is indeed conserved.

We have demonstrated that a fully consistent quantum
theory can be built with non-hermitian operators. We have
imposed that “observables” are diagonalizable, which as-
sures that the spectrum can be measured. Its reality, on the
other hand, yields unitary dynamics and thus the conserva-
tion of probability.
Let |A0(cid:105) be a “ready to measure” initial state of the
apparatus A. Further, by |ψn(cid:105), |ψm(cid:105) we denote distinct
(n (cid:54)= m) eigenstates of H. Also, we assume that E∗
n = En

(cid:11). The recording process |A0(cid:105) →(cid:12)(cid:12)Aψ

(cid:11) is unitary and does

(cid:12)(cid:12)Aψ

and without loss of generality, we choose A to be a hermi-
tian system. The repeatability of measurements guarantees
that every unitary transfer of information from system S to
A leaves states |ψn(cid:105) and |ψm(cid:105) undisturbed. It follows that

U : |ψk(cid:105)|A0(cid:105) → |ψk(cid:105)|Ak(cid:105)

for k = n, m,

(8)
where U is a unitary map (e.g. UU† = I) modeling the
recording process. As illustrated in Fig. 1, after the trans-
fer has been completed, new states |Am(cid:105) and |An(cid:105) of the
apparatus A encode the information about the system’s
eigenstates |ψn(cid:105) and |ψm(cid:105). The measurement preserves
the norm on the Hilbert space S ⊗ A as well. Hence

(cid:104)φm|ψn(cid:105) (1 − (cid:104)Am|An(cid:105)) = 0.

(9)
As a result, the apparatus states |Am(cid:105) and |An(cid:105) can dif-
fer (indicating some information being stored) only when
(cid:104)φm|ψn(cid:105) = 0. To put it differently, extracting information
that distinguishes between two measured states is possible
only when the transition probability between state |ψn(cid:105) and
|ψm(cid:105) vanishes.

The above analysis demonstrates that the reality of the
spectrum, which guarantees unitarity, rather that hermitic-
ity is necessary to acquire information. We stress that
|(cid:104)ψm|ψn(cid:105)|2 is not the transition probability between states
|ψn(cid:105) and |ψm(cid:105). That is given by |(cid:104)φm|ψn(cid:105)|2 and the two
coincide only when H is hermitian as only then the left and
right eigenstates are the same.

Adopting the similar formula that was derived for her-
mitian systems (see e.g. Eq. 2b in [2]) one could write
(cid:104)ψm|ψn(cid:105) (1 − (cid:104)Am|An(cid:105)) = 0. As a result, one would have
to conclude that (cid:104)Am|An(cid:105) = 1 showing the apparatus can-
not tell the measured states apart. However, as we have
shown, since H is non-hermitian Eq. (9) applies, which al-
lows non-orthogonal states to be measured.

Relation to hermitian systems. Thus far we have seen
that the proper identiﬁcation of probabilities of the mea-
surement outcomes allows to include non-hermitian opera-
tors into the usual framework of quantum mechanics rather
naturally. This is done, in a physically consistent way, by
properly accounting for the fact that non-hermitian observ-
ables have different left and right eigenstates. The proba-
bility pn = |(cid:104)φn|ψ(cid:105)|2 to ﬁnd the system in its eigenstate
|ψn(cid:105) can also be rewritten, using this state explicitly, as

pn = | ((cid:104)ψn| g)|ψ(cid:105)|2,

g =

|φm(cid:105)(cid:104)φm| .

(10)

(cid:88)

m

Thus, the Dirac correspondence between bra and ket vec-
tors can now be understood as (cid:104)ψ| g ↔ |ψ(cid:105). Above, g is a
positive-deﬁnite, invertible linear operator – that is a met-
ric [26]. Indeed, we have

(cid:104)ψ| g |ψ(cid:105) =

|(cid:104)φm|ψ(cid:105)|2, g−1 =

|ψn(cid:105)(cid:104)ψn| , (11)

m

n

where the ﬁrst equality expresses positivity and the second
expression provides an explicit formula for the inverse map
in terms of eigenstates |ψn(cid:105). As a result, assigning prob-
abilities when measuring non-hermitian “observables” de-
ﬁnes a new inner product, namely (ψ, gφ). Moreover, a
simple calculation shows that H†g = gH and therefore
(Hψ, gφ) = (ψ, gHφ) for all states |ψ(cid:105), |φ(cid:105). This fact can
also be interpreted as: H is hermitian with respect to this
new inner product.

In conclusion, from the viewpoint of a measurement,
there is no physical difference between non-hermitian
operators with real spectrum and hermitian observables.
Therefore, one should be able to represent quantum sys-
tems either way depending on the situation. Of course, in
complete analogy to classical physics the goal is to ﬁnd the
simplest possible Hamiltonian. One can establish a corre-
spondence between H and its hermitian counterpart K in
the following way [27]

K = g1/2Hg−1/2 = eG/2He−G/2

= H +

1
2

[G, H] +

2!22 [G, [G, H]] + ···

(12)

where G := ln(g). In the second line we have used the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff like formula [28]. Note, since
the metric g is positive deﬁnite its logarithm and square
root exist and moreover, both of these quantities are her-
mitian operators [29].
[30] Although this inﬁnite series
does not truncate after a ﬁnite number of terms in general,
there are physically relevant examples where it does (see
Example 2 below). We stress that Eq. (12) can be used to
transform an arbitrary observable O between hermitian and
non-hermitian representations.

First of the above equations (12) shows that K is in-
deed hermitian, whereas the second line demonstrates an
interesting feature of physical reality. Namely, a quantum

3

system can be represented equivalently either by a hermi-
tian operator or a non-hermitian one with real spectrum.
Although there is no essential physical difference between
the two representations, their mathematical structures are
quite different.
It follows directly from Eq. (12) that a
complicated hermitian system may have a very simple
non-hermitian representation and vice versa. Transforma-
tion (12) plays an analogous role to the canonical transfor-
mation well established in classical mechanics [22]. Note,
this transformation cannot be unitary as it changes the her-
miticity of an operator. However, it preserves the canoni-
cal commutation relation and as such belongs to a class of
quantum canonical transformations [19, 31].

In classical mechanics, Newtonian equations of mo-
tion have to be modiﬁed in non-standard, time-dependent,
frames of reference [22]. As a result, one observes so-
called inertial forces. Typical examples include Coriolis or
centrifugal forces that are present only in rotating frames
of reference. Therefore, there are experimentally accessi-
ble consequences of using such non-inertial coordinates.
One of the most famous examples is the Foucault pen-
dulum whose motion (precession) directly reﬂects on the
Earth’s rotation around its own axis [32, 33].

Interestingly, if the non-hermitian Hamiltonian is time-
dependent then the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation
also has to be modiﬁed to preserve unitarity [34–36],

i∂t |ψt(cid:105) = (Ht + Ft)|ψt(cid:105) , Ft = − i

2

Λ−1
t ∂tΛt.

(13)

Above, Λt is a time-dependent metric that does not neces-
sarily coincide with gt [35]. More importantly, this metric
is not unique. However, it can be chosen so that the cor-
responding hermitian Hamiltonian Kt in Eq. (12) (i) is the
generator of dynamics and (ii) has exactly the same spec-
trum as Ht.

Therefore, the dynamics in these two representations dif-
fer considerably. Nevertheless, replacing ∂t with a covari-
ant derivative Dt := ∂t + Λ−1
t ∂tΛt/2 [37] the Schr¨odinger
Eq. (13) can be put into its standard form, i.e., with Ht be-
ing the generator, iDt |ψt(cid:105) = Ht |ψt(cid:105). However, one can
also think of the extra energetic contribution ∼ Λ−1
t ∂tΛt/2
as being a manifestation of a force of inertia keeping a
quantum system along the unitary path during its evolution
(see Example 3 below).

It is worth mentioning that the existence of Ft in non-
hermitian representations has already been noticed yet dis-
regarded as unphysical (see for example [20] and com-
ments that followed). It was treated rather as a mathemat-
ical necessity not having much to do with physical reality.
We will now illustrate the novel concepts with several ana-
lytically tractebel example.
Example 1: Paradigmatic PT - symmetric system. As
a ﬁrst example consider a harmonic oscillator with a non-
hermitian perturbation, for instance [38]

H =

p2
2m

+

2

mω2x2 + ix3 ≡ H0 + H1,

(14)

where H0 corresponds to the unperturbed harmonic oscil-
lator and H1 is an anharmonic perturbation. Parameters m
and ω correspond to the system’s mass and the size of the
harmonic trap, respectively. Here  is a small perturbation.
The momentum p and position x operators obey the stan-
dard canonical commuatation relation, [x, p] = i. This
model has been extensively investigated in literature [39].
Numerical studies have conﬁrmed the reality of its spec-
trum for all real . Using perturbation theory one can es-
tablish that K = H0 + V (x, p) where the momentum de-
pendent potential V (x, p) up to O(3) reads [27]

(cid:18)

3mω2

{x2, p2} + p x2p +

2,

V =

mω4

(15)
where {A, B} := AB + BA is the anticommutator be-
tween A and B. Observe that this very complicated, mo-
mentum dependent potential can effectively be replaced by
a simple non-hermitian term V ∼ ix3, which only depends
on the position x [40].

Example 2: Localization in condensed matter physics.
Another interesting example is a general one dimensional
quantum system whose Hamiltonian reads K = p2/2m +
V (x), where V (x) is an arbitrary potential. This standard
textbook hermitian model can be turned into a very power-
ful non-hermitian system that can explain localization ef-
fects in solid state physics [41, 42]. Indeed, we have

H = e−ηxKeηx =

(p − iη)2

2m

+ V (x),

(16)

where the real parameter η expresses an external magnetic
ﬁeld [43]. Note that the metric g = e2ηx in this case can
be calculated explicitly. Furthermore, it depends on the
external control parameter – the magnetic ﬁeld [44]. Also,
since the commutator [x, p] = i is a complex number the
inﬁnite series in Eq. (12) truncates after only two terms.

Example 3: Time-dependent metric and force of inertia.
Finally, assume that the metric g from the previous exam-
ple depends explicitly on time (e.g. the magnetic ﬁeld ηt is
time-dependent). We further choose V (x) to be a harmonic
trap, V (x) = mω2x2/2, where ω is its frequency. Then
the Hamiltonian in Eq. (16), now time-dependent, can be
written using the second quantization [45] as

Ht = ω

where α = (cid:112)/2mω and a, a† are annihilation and

(a + ηtα) +

(17)

creation operators, respectively. As explained above, to
preserve unitarity the evolution generator Ht in the non-
hermitian representation has to be modiﬁed accordingly.
By setting Λt = gt [16] in Eq. (13) we have

particle as a function of time t. Blue solid curve is the exact
solution to the Schr¨odinger equation obtained in the hermitian
representation. Red points represent a numerical solution to the
same problem computed in the non-hermitian (time-dependent)

is accounted for [see Eq. (18)]. Finally, green dashed line depicts
a “naive” solution obtained without taking into account this con-
tribution. Parameters are  = m = 1.0, ω = 0.5 and ηt = t/τ,

where τ = 10. The initial state is |ψ0(cid:105) = (|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105))/

|0(cid:105) is the ground state of K = H0 and |1(cid:105) = a† |0(cid:105).

Ht → Ht + Ft, Ft = −i ˙ηtα(cid:0)a + a†(cid:1) .

(18)
To analyze the evolution of this system we turn to numer-
ical simulations. We further assume that ηt changes on a
time scale τ linearly, that is, ηt = t/τ for 0 ≤ t ≤ τ. The
√
initial state is given by |ψ0(cid:105) = (|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105))/
2, where |0(cid:105)
is the ground state of K = H0 and |1(cid:105) = a† |0(cid:105).
Figure 2 shows the average position (cid:104)x(cid:105) of a quantum
particle as a function of time t computed both in the her-
mitian (blue solid line) as well as the non-hermitian (red
points) representation. According to the Ehrenfest theo-
rem, (cid:104)x(cid:105) corresponds to the classical trajectory in a sense
that it obeys Newton’s equations of motion [46]. As we
can see, only when a proper energetic contribution Ft is ac-
counted for the two paths coincide. The Dashed green line,
on the other hand, depicts a non-unitary path resulting from
not taking into account this contribution. As expected, Ft
does not have any inﬂuence on the system’s dynamics in
non-accelerating frames of reference where ˙ηt = 0.

Summary. The very question whether physical observ-
ables should be hermitian or not reﬂects on a long last-
ing debate regarding physical reality. Nowadays, this issue
is no longer only of academic interest as leading groups
are beginning to investigate it experimentally (e.g. [5, 8]).
In this Letter we have revisited this problem showing that
the repeatability of measurements does not exclude non-
hermitian operators from the usual framework of quantum
mechanics. We have argued that operators which admit real
spectrum are canonicaly equivalent to hermitian ones. As a

(cid:20)

Ft - exact (hermitian) - numerical (Ft)- numerical (no Ft)Ft246810t-1.5-1.0-0.50.51.01.5〈x〉result, all fundamental notions (e.g. repeatability of a mea-
surement, no cloning theorem, etc.) that have been associ-
ated with the unitarity apply to all non-hermitian systems
with real spectrum as well.

The question which of these two representations is more
adequate to describe a quantum system depends on the
problem under investigation.
It may be more natural to
use a non-hermitain frame of reference. However in that
case, as a result of using a non-standard representation, the
resulting Schr¨odinger equation has to be modiﬁed accord-
ingly [see Eq. (13)]. There is an extra energetic contribu-
tion that has to be accounted for to preserve unitarity. We
have associated this energetic cost Ft with a inertial force
that keeps a quantum system on the unitary path during its
evolution (see Example 3). As it is in classical mechanics,
Ft vanishes for all non-accelerating frames of reference,
i.e. with ˙gt = 0.

We should stress here that not all non-hermitian systems
have real spectrum. Those whose eigenenergies (at least
some of them) are complex were explicitly excluded from
our considerations. Such systems are open [47]. During
their evolution they lose or gain energy and information in
a way that cannot be balanced [4]. Therefore, a unitary
map is not sufﬁcient to capture their dynamics anymore.
Interesting examples can be found e.g. in [8, 10].
