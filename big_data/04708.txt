Abstract

We discuss a non linear extension of a model of alliances in politics, recently proposed by
one of us. The model is constructed in terms of operators, describing the interest of three
parties to form, or not, some political alliance with the other parties. The time evolution
of what we call the decision functions is deduced by introducing a suitable hamiltonian,
which describes the main eﬀects of the interactions of the parties amongst themselves and
with their environments, which are generated by their electors and by people who still
have no clear idea for which party to vote (or even if to vote). The hamiltonian contains
some non-linear eﬀects, which takes into account the role of a party in the decision process
of the other two parties.

Moreover, we show how the same hamiltonian can also be used to construct a formal
structure which can describe the dynamics of buying and selling ﬁnancial assets (without
however implying a speciﬁc price setting mechanism).

Introduction

In a recent paper, [1], a model of interaction between political parties has been proposed. The
model describes a decision making procedure, deducing the time evolution of three so-called
decision functions (DFs), one for each party considered in our system. These functions describe
the interest of each party to form or not an alliance with some other party. Their decisions
are driven by the interaction of each party with the other parties, with their own electors, and
with a set of undecided voters (i.e. people who have not yet decided to vote for which party (if
at all they decide to vote)). The approach adopted in [1] uses an operatorial framework (see
also [2]), in which the DFs are suitable mean values of certain number operators associated to
the parties. The dynamics are driven by a suitable hamiltonian which implements the various
interactions between the diﬀerent actors of the system.

The limitation of the model, as described in [1], is that the hamiltonian is quadratic and,
as a consequence, the equations of motion are linear. This simpliﬁes quite a bit the analysis of
the time evolution of the system. In fact an exact solution can be deduced in that case, but the
price we pay is that the model is not entirely realistic, since the hamiltonian does not include
contributions which might be relevant in a concrete situation. In this paper we introduce several
non-linear contributions in the model, and we solve, adopting a suitable approximation, the
related non-linear diﬀerential equations. These non-linear terms are needed to introduce in the
model some sort of three-body interactions, which were not included in [1]. The reason why
these terms are interesting is because they describe (please see below for more details) the role
of, say, the ﬁrst party (P1), in the explicit strength of the interaction between the other two
parties, P2 and P3. This is important, since it is natural to assume that the DFs of both P2
and P3 also depend on what P1 is doing.

It is important to notice that not many contributions exist in the mathematical and physics
literature on politics, and only very few of them adopt a quantum mechanical (or operator)
point of view, as the one used in [1]. We refer to [3, 4, 5, 6] for some recent and not so recent
contributions on this topic.

After a long discussion on politics, we also show how the same hamiltonian can be used,

with just some minor changes, to deduce the dynamics of a buy-and-sell ﬁnancial system.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we introduce the model, we derive the
diﬀerential equations and we propose an approximation scheme to solve them. In Section III
we show how to model a simple ﬁnancial system using the same general settings. Section IV
contains our conclusions. To keep the paper self-contained, and to make it also more readable

to those who are not familiar with quantum mechanics, we have added an appendix where a
few crucial aspects of operators and quantum dynamics are reviewed.

II Modelling alliances in politics and its dynamics

In this section we discuss the details of our model and we will ﬁrst construct the vectors
describing the players and the hamiltonian of the system. We then deduce the diﬀerential
equations of motion. To keep the paper self contained, we recall ﬁrst a few important facts
which were already discussed in [1].

In our system we have three parties, P1, P2 and P3, which, together, form the system SP.
Each party has to make a choice, and it can choose only ‘one’ or ‘zero’, which corresponds
respectively to either form a coalition or not. This is, in fact, the only aspect of the parties
we are interested in. Hence, we have eight diﬀerent possibilities, to which we associate eight
diﬀerent and mutually orthogonal vectors in an eight-dimensional Hilbert space HP. These
vectors are ϕi,k,l, with i, k, l = 0, 1. As an example, the ﬁrst vector, ϕ0,0,0, describes the fact
that, at t = 0, no party wants to ally with the other parties. Of course, this attitude can change
during the time evolution. What is interesting to know is: how does this attitude change? And
how can one describe this change? Let us consider another example. For instance, ϕ0,1,0,
describes the fact that, at t = 0, P1 and P3 do not want to form any coalition, while P2 does.
Fϕ = {ϕi,k,l, i, k, l = 0, 1} is an orthonormal basis for HP. A generic vector of SP, for t = 0, is
a linear combination of the form

Ψ =

αi,k,lϕi,k,l,

(2.1)

1(cid:88)

i,k,l=0

where we assume(cid:80)1

i,k,l=0 |αi,k,l|2 = 1 in order to normalize the total probability, [7]. In partic-
ular, for instance, |α0,0,0|2 represents the probability that SP is, at t = 0, in a state ϕ0,0,0, i.e.
that P1, P2 and P3 have chosen ‘0’ (no coalition).

As in [1], and for the same reasons (see below), we construct the vectors ϕi,k,l in a very
special way, starting with the vacuum of three fermionic operators, p1, p2 and p3, i.e. three
operators which, together with their adjoint, satisfy the canonical anticommutation relation
l} = δk,l and {pk, pl} = 0. Here {x, y} = xy + yx, for all pairs x and y. More in
(CAR) {pk, p
†
detail, ϕ0,0,0 is such that pjϕ0,0,0 = 0, j = 1, 2, 3. The other vectors ϕi,j,k can be constructed
acting on ϕ0,0,0 with the operators p

and so on. Let now ˆPj = p
jpj be the so-called number operator of the j-th party, which is
†
j. Since ˆPjϕn1,n2,n3 = njϕn1,n2,n3, for j = 1, 2, 3, it is
constructed using pj and its adjoint, p
clear that ϕn1,n2,n3 are eigenvectors of these operators, while their eigenvalues, zero and one,
correspond to the only possible choices admitted for the three parties at t = 0. This is, in
fact, the main reason why we have used here the fermionic operators pj: they automatically
produce only these eigenvalues. Our ﬁrst eﬀort now consists in giving a dynamics to the number
operators ˆPj, following the general scheme proposed in [2]. Hence, we look for an Hamiltonian
H which describes the interactions between the various constituents of the system. Once H is
given, we can compute ﬁrst the time evolution of the number operators as ˆPj(t) := eiHt ˆPje−iHt,
and we can then ascertain their mean values on some suitable state describing the system at
t = 0, in order to get what we have already called decision functions, (DFs) (please see below).
The rules needed to write down H are described in [2], and adopted in [1] where it is also
discussed why the three parties are just part of a larger system which must also include the
set of electors. In fact, it is mainly this interaction which creates the ﬁnal decision. Hence, SP
must be open, and we mean with this that there must exist some large environment, R, which
interacts with P1, P2 and P3, and it produces some sort of feedback used by Pj to decide.
Fermionic operators (depending also on a continuous index) are also used to describe their
environment, [1].

The various elements of our model are described in Figure 1, where the various arrows show

all the admissible interactions.

In this ﬁgure Rj represents the set of the electors of Pj, while Rund is the set of all the
undecided voters. Figure 1 shows, for instance, that P1 can interact with R1 and Rund, but
neither with R2 nor with R3. We also see that P1 interacts with both P2 and P3. To deﬁne the
hamiltonian which describes, in our framework, the scheme in Figure 1, we start introducing
the following purely quadratic operator, which is, essentially, the one adopted in [1]:

ij and ν(l)

The ﬁrst contribution in (2.2) is H0, which describes the free evolution of the operators of
S = SP ⊗R, where R = (R1⊗R2⊗R3)⊗Rund. If, in particular, all the interaction parameters
λj, ˜λj, µ(l)
ij are zero, then H = H0. Hence, since in this case [H, ˆPj] = 0, the number
operators describing the choices of the three parties (and their related DFs) stay constant in
time. In other words, in the absence of interactions, the original choice of each Pj is not aﬀected
by the time evolution. Translating this in the Schr¨odinger representation, this means that if
SP is in an eigenstate ϕn1,n2,n3 of H0, then it remains in the same state also for t > 0. However,
we should also add that if SP is in the state Ψ in (2.1), we might have non trivial dynamics
already at this level. As discussed in [1], HP Bs describes the interaction between the three
†
parties and their related groups of electors: pjB
j (k) describes the fact that, when some sort
of global reaction against alliance (GRAA) increases, then Pj tends to chose ‘0’ (no coalition).
j describes the fact that Pj looks for some coalition when the GRAA
†
On the other hand, Bj(k)p
†
j and pj in
of its electors decreases. This is because of the raising and lowering operators p
†
these interaction terms, coupled respectively with the lowering (Bj(k)) and raising (B
j (k))
operators of the electors of Pj. A similar interpretation holds for HP B, with the diﬀerence
that the interaction is now between the parties and a single set of undecided voters. The last
contribution in h, Hint,l, is introduced to describe the fact that the parties also attempt to
talk to each other to get some agreement. Two possibilities are allowed; i) the parties act
†
k), and; ii) they make
cooperatively (they make the same choice, and we have terms like p
opposite choices. For instance P1 tries to form some alliance, while P2 excludes this possibility
jk decides which

quadratic, so that the contributions they produce in the diﬀerential Heisenberg equations turn

out to be linear. This is the reason why it was possible, in [1], to produce an analytical solution
for the time evolution of the system. However, the extra terms in (2.5) make, in our opinion,
the situation more interesting from the point of view of the real interpretation. In fact, whilst
in Hint,l the will of P1 to form or not an alliance with P2 is totally independent of what P3
is doing, this is not so when we also consider δh. For instance, let us consider the interaction
between P1 and P2, and in particular let us focus on the exchange term, which we now rewrite
as follows:

.

The meaning of the two contributions is now evident: the ﬁrst term, i.e. the one proportional
12 in the RHS, describes the fact that the more P3 is willing to ally with P1 or P2, the
to µ(1)
more these two parties tend to behave diﬀerently: one is pleased with P3’s attentions, the other
12 , describes a speculative behavior. P1 and
is not. The other term, the one proportional to µ(2)
P2 tend to behave diﬀerently when the interest of P3 to form a coalition is low. In other words,
what decides the relative strength of the P1 ↔ P2 interaction is not (only) the relative value of
12 , but also, and more interestingly, the attitude of P3 to form (or not) a coalition.
µ(1)
12 and µ(2)
The behavior of P1 and P2 is related also to what P3 is doing. Of course, a similar analysis
can be repeated for the other terms in hex
the presence of Nj or
11 − Nj introduces, again, diﬀerent weights in the various terms of the hamiltonian. However,
the other two parties now tend to behave in the same way. For instance, rewriting

we see that when P3 wants to form some coalition, then both P1 and P2 react in the same way.
They both try to form (or not to form) a coalition, with P3, or between themselves. Moreover,
we are also considering the possibility in which the strength of the interaction is proportional
to 11 − N3 rather than to N3. Of course, we stress again that other than the value of N3, what
is also crucial in deciding the strength of the various terms in δh, are the numerical values of
the parameters µ(k)

We are now ready to continue with the analysis of the dynamics of the system. The Heisen-

Once we have deduced pj(t), we need to compute the DFs Pj(t), which are deﬁned as follows:

Pj(t) :=

(2.13)
j = 1, 2, 3. Here (cid:104).(cid:105) is a state over the full system. These states, [2], are taken to be suitable
tensor products of vector states for SP and states on the reservoir which obey some standard
rules (please see below). More in detail, for each operator of the form XS ⊗ YR, XS being an
operator of SP and YR an operator of the reservoir, we put

,

(cid:104)XS ⊗ YR(cid:105) := (cid:104)ϕn1,n2,n3, XSϕn1,n2,n3(cid:105) ωR(YR).

(2.14)

Here ϕn1,n2,n3 is one of the vectors introduced at the beginning of this section, and each nj
represents, as discussed before, the tendency of Pj to form (or not) some coalition at t = 0.
Moreover, ωR(.) is a state on R satisfying the following standard properties, [2]:

ωR(11R) = 1, ωR(Bj(k)) = ωR(B

†
j (k)) = 0, ωR(B

j (k)Bl(q)) = Nj(k) δj,lδ(k − q),
†

as well as

ωR(B(k)) = ωR(B†(k)) = 0, ωR(B†(k)B(q)) = N (k) δ(k − q),

(2.15)

(2.16)

for some suitable functions Nj(k) and N (k), which we take here to be constant in k: Nj(k) = Nj
and N (k) = N . Also, we assume ωR(Bj(k)Bl(q)) = ωR(B(k)B(q)) = 0, for all j and l. The
reason why we use the state in (2.14) is because it describes, in our framework, the fact that,
at t = 0, Pj’s decision is nj, while the overall feeling of the voters Rj is Nj, and that of the
undecided ones is N . Of course, these might appear as oversimplifying assumptions, but they
still produce in many concrete applications, rather interesting dynamics for the model.

II.1 The solution

To begin with, we consider now a simple but still non-trivial situation, which allows us to write
the diﬀerential equations of the system in a reasonably simple way and to ﬁnd an approximate
solution. This suggests a strategy which can be easily generalized to other situations. This is,
in fact, what we will do in the last part of this section.

Let us assume for the moment that the coeﬃcients in δh are such

δµ
13 = δν

13 = δµ

23 = δν

23 = δν

12 = 0,

while δµ

the system non-linear, but not extremely complicated (at least not from the point of view of

Solving exactly equation (2.17) is quite hard, if not impossible, due to the non-linearity included
in Λ(P (t)). However, it is easy to set up a recursive approximation approach which might
converge to, or at least approximate, the solution. The idea is simple, and it works better
under the assumption that δ is suﬃciently small.
In this case we replace (2.17) with the
˙P0(t) = T P0(t) + η(t), which is linear and can be easily
following, much simpler, equation:
solved. The solution is

P0(t) = eT t

P (0) +

e−T t1η0(t1)dt1

,

where we have introduced, for reasons which will be clear in a moment, η0(t) ≡ η(t). We can
now use this zero-th order approximation of P (t) in Λ(P (t)), in equation (2.17), which becomes
˙P1(t) = T P1(t) + η1(t), where η1(t) = η0(t) + iδΛ(P0(t)). Notice that η1(t) is now a known
function. The solution of this equation is

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

P1(t) = eT t

P (0) +

e−T t1η1(t1)dt1

.

(cid:18)

Of course, we can iterate the procedure, and the n-th approximation is

(cid:90) t

(cid:19)

Pn(t) = eT t

P (0) +

e−T t1ηn(t1)dt1

,

(2.18)

0

where ηn(t) = η(t) + iδΛ(Pn−1(t)), for n ≥ 1. Hence, at least in principle, we can reach the
level of approximation we want. However, we should also say that it is not guaranteed that
the sequence {Pn(t)} really converges to the solution of (2.17), even if this might appear rather
reasonable. Similar problems often occur when non-linear diﬀerential equations are considered,
as it happens in our system. Summarizing, we cannot, a priori, say that (i) limn→∞ Pn(t) exists
(in some suitable topology), and (ii) even if it exists, if this limit is the solution of equation
(2.17). Nevertheless, what we can safely say, is that Pn(t) is a certain approximation of P (t),
and we suspect that this approximation is suﬃciently good for small δ and t, and for large n.
Of course, more could be said only after numerical computations or looking for some a priori
estimates. This is indeed part of our work in progress.

kl = δν

However, there is a situation in which the computations can be carried out explicitly. In
fact, if δµ
kl = 0 for all k, l, then, as already observed, the equations reduce to those for
the linear system1. Hence, they are exactly solvable and the result has been discussed in [1].
Looking at the analytical form of δh in (2.5), this can be understood since it corresponds to
the fact that, for instance, P1 and P2 react with the same strength to the will of P3 to either
create or not an alliance.

In the next section we will brieﬂy show that we can consider cases other than the one
considered above. In fact, a general solution can also be found even when the parameters in δh
are diﬀerent from each other.

II.2 A more general situation

23 = δν

It is clear that when we give up the working assumptions we have considered above (i.e. δµ
13 =
13 = δµ
δν
12 = 0), the explicit form of the non-linear term iδΛ(P (t)) changes. This is
due to the presence of several parameters and not of just one. Consequently, it is convenient
to modify the strategy and this can be done as follows: the starting point is the equation

23 = δν

˙P (t) = T P (t) + η(t) + ˜Λ(P (t)),

1Incidentally we observe that this does not imply that all the parameters of δh are zero. It only means that

they coincide in pairs.

12

where ˜Λ(P (t)) is the strong non-linear contribution which extends the term iδΛ(P (t)) in (2.17).
Introducing now P1(t) = e−T tP (t), η1(t) = e−T tη(t) and ˜Λ1(P1(t)) = e−T t ˜Λ(eT tP (t)), the
equation for P1(t) becomes

˙P1(t) = η1(t) + ˜Λ1(P1(t)),

(cid:82) t
which can be still be re-written in a more convenient form by introducing further the η2(t) =
0 η1(t1)dt1, and the new unknown P2(t) = P1(t) − η2(t).
In fact, calling now ˜Λ2(P2(t)) =
˜Λ1(P2(t) + η2(t)), we get a very simple diﬀerential equation,

whose formal solution is

(cid:90)

˙P2(t) = ˜Λ2(P2(t)),

˜Λ−1
2 (P2) = t + α,

dP2

(2.19)

α being an integration constant. Of course, this solution is formal because of several reasons:
ﬁrstly, we don’t know a priori if ˜Λ−1
2 (P2) exists. Secondly, we are not sure we can compute
its integral. Thirdly, we are working with operators (and not with simple functions). This
makes the situation even more complicated. However, in principle, formula (2.19) produces the
solution of the general problem, without any approximation. Hence, from a certain point of
view, it looks much more interesting than the solution deduced in the previous section. We
will devote a future analysis to a deeper, and more explicit, analysis of the results arising from
equation (2.19).

III Dynamics of buying and selling

We have already remarked in several papers (please see in particular [8, 9] for recent results)
that the above extended hamiltonian framework could be applied to economics and ﬁnance.
We show now that this is true and in so doing we change the interpretation of the model
considered here. In particular, we will now discuss that the resulting framework becomes akin
to a formal structure which can describe the dynamics of buying and selling (of ﬁnancial assets
for instance). However, the framework does not explicitly provide for a mechanism by which
prices can be generated. We note ﬁrst that when considering the diﬀerent terms which are part
of H = h + δh, we can in eﬀect make an argument that the hamiltonians H0, HP Bs, HP B are
associated with public information which occurs at a macroscale, since they are connected with
some reservoirs which describe in fact (please see below), large groups of people. As is reported
in [10], the reaction of traders on this public information is then transferred onto smaller scales,

13

i.e. to traders themselves. The scale at which this happens is cast by the hamiltonians Hint,l
and h.

The above framework, we insist, hints back to the binary choice of either buying and selling.
The key reason for that is that the eigenvalues of the number operators are either ‘0’ or ‘1’. The
ﬁnancial system which we want to emulate with H = h+δh must contain interactions and hence
we can not be satisﬁed with just using H0. This interaction in the framework proposed here
can be either at the macroscale and/or the microscale (i.e. between the traders). The division
of two grand types of information, i.e. public and private information occurs typically (and
intuitively) at respectively the macroscale and the microscale. One can of course be rigorous
about this. Work by [11] for instance shows that private information has no eﬀect at all on
traders when they behave in a rational expectations model.

To make sure we use some reference framework from the economics literature on how to
properly deﬁne public versus private information, we resort to [12] who deﬁne public information
as having the potential to be known by everyone, whilst private information may be known
by one single individual. In our situation, the decision functions Pj(t) describe the will of the
three traders2, P1, P2 and P3, to buy (zero) or to sell (one) some assets. This choice is driven
by public information (i.e. by Rj and Rund, see below) and by private information (i.e. by the
mutual interaction between the traders).

On the basis of public information, traders can adjust their portfolio holdings and this, as
[12] indicates, can aﬀect prices in the market. The opposite may well be true in the case of
private information, where a single party proﬁts but with no necessary eﬀect on price behavior.
What is interesting is the statement by [12] that almost always (see p. 224), will there be
processes operating which will ‘publicize’ private information. Please consider again HP Bs,
HP B which was mentioned in the context of the politics example above. Assume we have three
traders who have the binary elemental task of either selling or buying. Denote H = h + δh
as the hamiltonian which describes the dynamics of buying and selling over time, under the
inﬂuence of both private and public information. Besides the no-interaction hamiltonian, H0,
the dynamic drivers which are associated to public information are, as stated, HP Bs and HP B.
From an economics point of view, the baths R1, R2 and R3 now signify a vast collection of
informed traders with which our three traders interact with (in view of performing the elemental
task of buying and selling). Whilst the bath Rund consists of a vast collection of traders, who
can be interpreted as noise traders. This can be easily achieved in our model by assuming some

2Of course, we are sticking here to just three traders because of our previous application to political alliances,

but it is not diﬃcult to extend the model to more traders.

14

randomness of the ˜λj in (2.2). A question arises whether we can be rigorous in deﬁning those
two types of traders. In [13] noise traders are deﬁned as traders who act upon information
which is more often than not, spurious information. Informed traders have at their command
information which can be objectively used in decisions involving buying or selling.

The contribution of HP Bs in H (i.e. the full driver of the dynamics of buying and selling)
describes the interaction between the three traders and the baths of informed traders. Clearly,
we want to point out that this interaction is occurring via the medium of public information,
†
j (k) describes now leads to (say) the
given the size of the baths. The mechanism that pjB
action of selling by traders given that some public information (from informed traders) has
been released that ‘selling’ is what one should do. In identical fashion do we argue for a buying
†
j occurs. But note also the contribution of HP B, which now inﬂuences
signal when Bj(k)p
traders to sell or buy given public information coming from noise traders. Both those buying
and selling signals, whether they either derive from the interaction with the baths R1, R2 and
R3 or the Rund bath, have the potential to ultimately inﬂuence price setting given that public
information is at stake.

What is contained in Hint(cid:48)l and δh are communications between traders, without recourse
to the public information baths. We have three traders, and by virtue of this very small size,
it is perfectly intuitive to call the information, upon which traders make decisions within this
interaction setting, to be private information. But as has been remarked above, whilst in Hint(cid:48)l
the individual’s traders decision of buying and selling does not aﬀect their ‘partner’ traders,
there is a very explicit dependence between the individual’s traders built in when considering
δh. However, private information as such is not expected to inﬂuence price behavior. Private
information, as we have remarked above, seems to be subject to the act of ‘publicizing’ private
information. Well known notions like information leakage and uncertainty creation can be
following from such an act. See [12] and [14] for a discussion. In [14] (see also [13]), information
leakage is deﬁned as “situations where agents wish to reveal truthfully their private possessed
information to others”. Such type of release of information invites in cooperation amongst
agents and it also very clearly creates an interdependence between agents. Information leakage
can be selective, i.e. agent 1 can release information only to agent 2 and thereby alienate
agent 3. Similarly, in the case of so called ‘uncertainty creation’, information is created which
is on purpose false or erroneous, so as to induce other agents in error so it can serve one’s
own investment strategy. This is again an example of private information which, on purpose,
creates dependencies between traders. One can even get more precise by considering the quality
of the private information. Trader 1 can release private information with noise to trader 2 but

15

without any noise to trader 3. See [15] (p. 71). One can even be more reﬁned and introduce so
called knowledge operators in the modeling of information. See again [15] (p. 4-). Of course,
these several diﬀerent eﬀects all suggest the relevance of the full hamiltonian H in (2.5), and
importance is given to its various contributions also in this economics context. Incidentally,
this means that the diﬀerential equations governing this particular application are again (2.6),
so that the same approximation procedure discussed in Section II.1 can be adopted. Needless
to say, that for this particular application, our next step will surely be to produce numerical
solutions and/or analytical estimates. This is, for the present model, a hard task. However,
it can be easily done in the linear case, simply by adapting what we have done in [1] to the
present situation. Before doing that, we would like to mention that this analogy presented here
in this section does query however, how departures from equilibrium can be caused by Hint,l
and δh if we align those hamiltonians with the existence of private information. As such buying
and selling ensuing from private information is unlikely to aﬀect price behavior. Hence, this
is unlikely to aﬀect the equilibrium price obtained out of public information-based buying and
selling.

III.1 Back to the linear case

kl = µ(2)

kl = ν(1)

kl = ν(2)

In this section we see what happens when δh = 0, i.e. when µ(1)
kl = 0 for
all k and l. In this case, H = h, which is quadratic in creation and annihilation operators,
and the diﬀerential equations (2.17) become linear. Essentially, we go back to what we have
done, in a political context, in [1]. In fact the numerical plots are completely analogous. For
instance, Figures 2 and 3 show the three DFs for two diﬀerent choices of the parameters of
the hamiltonian and for certain initial conditions (please see the ﬁgure’s caption). These two
sets of parameters correspond to two diﬀerent situations. In the ﬁrst situation, Figure 2, each
trader interacts with its related Rj, but not with Rund. They also interact amongst them, but
†
2p1 in (2.2). In the
only adopt the mutual diﬀerent mechanism described by terms like p
second situation, Figure 3, we describe a similar situation but with the diﬀerence that the only
†
2 + p2p1
possible interaction between the traders is of the cooperative type: only terms like p
survive.

†
1p2 + p

†
1p

From both ﬁgures we see that, with these choices of parameters and initial conditions, the
three DFs begin oscillating and then reach some asymptotic value, which is not just zero or
one. In [1] we have discussed why this is so, and when a sharp result can be really deduced.
The conclusion, here, is that it is quite unlikely that the traders reach some decision they are
completely satisﬁed with. However, see for instance P1(t) and P2(t) in Figure 3, the asymptotic

1,2 = 0.2, µ(0)

values of both these DFs are close to one. Hence, we see that the decision process produces a
sort of unique decision. On the other hand, P3 is not really sure of what he has to do, since
P3(t) for large t approaches 0.4, which is not so close to zero.

A diﬀerent story is described by Figure 4, where we are assuming that the traders only
interact among themselves and not with any Rj or with Rund. When this happens it is clear
that none of the traders is able to reach a ﬁnal decision on whether to buy or sell the asset.
They just oscillate between diﬀerent feelings, but a conclusion can only be reached when the
traders also have some input from the larger sets of informed and noise traders.

IV Conclusions

In this paper we have shown how to use operatorial techniques, and an Heisenberg-like dy-
namics, to describe two diﬀerent, but somehow related, decision making processes. One such
process is related to political alliances and the other process relates to buy and sell phenom-

ena. A non-linear model which extends the model proposed in [1], has been introduced and
an approximate procedure for the solution of the related equations of motion has also been
proposed. We postpone to a second part of the paper the explicit analysis of these solutions,
and a detailed analysis of the role of the parameters of the model. We claim that, for small
values of the parameters governing the non-linearity, and for time intervals suﬃciently small,
these solutions do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those deduced in [1]. It is of course of interest
to check what happens for longer intervals, and this will form part of a forthcoming project.
Also, it can be interesting to extend the system described in Figure 1 adding more arrows.
In particular, a natural extension of the model discussed in Section II can be constructed by
admitting that, for instance, P1 also interacts with R2 and R3 (i.e. to try to convince them to
change their intentions of vote).

Appendix: A few results on the number representation

To keep the paper self-contained, we discuss here a few important facts in quantum mechanics
and in the so–called number representation.

Let H be a Hilbert space, and B(H) the set of all the (bounded) operators on H. Let S be
our physical system, and A the set of all the operators useful for a complete description of S,
which includes the observables of S. For simplicity, it is convenient (but not really necessary) to
assume that A coincides with B(H) itself. The description of the time evolution of S is related
to a self–adjoint operator H = H† which is called the hamiltonian of S, and which in standard

Heisenberg representation, in which the time evolution of an observable X ∈ A is given by

X(t) = exp(iHt)X exp(−iHt),

(A.1)

or, equivalently, by the solution of the diﬀerential equation

dX(t)

= i exp(iHt)[H, X] exp(−iHt) = i[H, X(t)],

(A.2)
where [A, B] := AB − BA is the commutator between A and B. The time evolution deﬁned in
this way is a one–parameter group of automorphisms of A.

An operator Z ∈ A is a constant of motion if it commutes with H. Indeed, in this case,

dt

equation (A.2) implies that ˙Z(t) = 0, so that Z(t) = Z for all t.

In some previous applications, [2], a special role was played by the so–called canonical
commutation relations. Here, these are replaced by the so–called canonical anti–commutation
(cid:96), (cid:96) = 1, 2, . . . , L} satisfy the CAR if the

hold true for all (cid:96), n = 1, 2, . . . , L. Here, 11 is the identity operator and {x, y} := xy + yx is
the anticommutator of x and y. These operators, which are widely analyzed in any quantum
mechanics textbook (see, for instance, [16, 17]) are those which are used to describe L diﬀerent

are both self–adjoint. In particular, ˆn(cid:96) is the number operator for the (cid:96)–th mode, while ˆN is the
number operator of S. Compared with bosonic operators, the operators introduced here satisfy
a very important feature: if we try to square them (or to rise to higher powers), we simply get
zero: for instance, from (A.3), we have a2
(cid:96) = 0. This is related to the fact that fermions satisfy
the Fermi exclusion principle [17].

(cid:96)a(cid:96) and ˆN =(cid:80)L

The Hilbert space of our system is constructed as follows: we introduce the vacuum of
the theory, that is a vector ϕ0 which is annihilated by all the operators a(cid:96): a(cid:96)ϕ0 = 0 for all
†
(cid:96) = 1, 2, . . . , L. Such a non zero vector surely exists. Then we act on ϕ0 with the operators a

ϕn1,n2,...,nL := (a

(A.4)

ˆn(cid:96)ϕn1,n2,...,nL = n(cid:96)ϕn1,n2,...,nL and ˆN ϕn1,n2,...,nL = N ϕn1,n2,...,nL, where N =(cid:80)L

n(cid:96) = 0, 1 for all (cid:96). These vectors form an orthonormal set and are eigenstates of both ˆn(cid:96) and ˆN :
(cid:96)=1 n(cid:96). Moreover,

20

using the CAR, we deduce that

and

ˆn(cid:96) (a(cid:96)ϕn1,n2,...,nL) = (n(cid:96) − 1)(a(cid:96)ϕn1,n2,...,nL)

(cid:96) are called the annihilation and the creation operators. Notice that, in

(cid:96) is also an annihilation operator since, acting on a state with n(cid:96) = 1, we destroy

for all (cid:96). Then a(cid:96) and a

that state.

The Hilbert space H is obtained by taking the linear span of all these vectors. Of course,
H has a ﬁnite dimension. In particular, for just one mode of fermions, dim(H) = 2. This also
implies that, contrarily to what happens for bosons, all the fermionic operators are bounded.

The vector ϕn1,n2,...,nL in (A.4) deﬁnes a vector (or number) state over the algebra A as

ωn1,n2,...,nL(X) = (cid:104)ϕn1,n2,...,nL, Xϕn1,n2,...,nL(cid:105),

(A.5)
where (cid:104) , (cid:105) is the scalar product in H. As we have discussed in [2], these states are useful to
project from quantum to classical dynamics and to ﬁx the initial conditions of the considered
system.
