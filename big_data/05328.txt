Eﬁmov physics is renowned for the self-similar spectrum featuring the universal ratio of one
eigenenergy to its neighbor. Even more esoteric is the numerically unveiled fact that every Eﬁmov
trimer is accompanied by a pair of tetramers. Here we demonstrate that this hierarchy of universal
few-body clusters has a topological origin by identifying the numbers of universal 3- and 4-body
bound states with the winding numbers of the renormalization-group limit cycle in theory space.
The ﬁnding suggests a topological phase transition in mass-imbalanced few-body systems which
should be tested experimentally.

Universality in physics often refers to a situation in
which apparently distinct systems show the same low-
energy behavior. A prominent example is the critical
phenomena, where diﬀerent physical systems are grouped
into a set of universality classes sharing the same criti-
cal exponents. The modern foundation for understand-
ing the universality is established by the renormalization
group (RG) [1], which allows us to investigate a change
of a system viewed at diﬀerent distance scales by fol-
lowing an RG ﬂow of system-parameters generated by a
recursive coarse graining of the system. In particular, the
universality classes of critical phenomena can be catego-
rized by the ﬁxed points of the RG ﬂow, which represent
the scale invariance of the second-order phase transition
at which no characteristic length scale is present.

Yet another characteristic RG ﬂow can be found in
universal quantum few-body physics that feature discrete
scale invariance. Here we consider the Eﬁmov eﬀect [2]
and its 4-body extension [3–5] in which resonantly inter-
acting 3 and 4 bosons form an inﬁnite series of universal
3- and 4-body bound states that feature the self-similar
spectrum: the 3-body bound states (Eﬁmov trimers) are
related to one another by a scaling factor of (22.7)2, and
each Eﬁmov trimer is accompanied by two 4-body bound
states (see Fig. 1). This discrete scale invariance makes
the Eﬁmov physics a prime example of the RG limit cycle
[6–10], where an RG ﬂow forms a periodic circle rather
than converges to a ﬁxed point. Because of the universal-
ity and the uniqueness, much theoretical [2, 11–16] and
experimental [17–27] eﬀorts have been devoted to reveal
the existence of the Eﬁmov trimers in a rich variety of
systems. Also, the existence of the 4-body companions
associated with Eﬁmov trimers has been conﬁrmed both
numerically [3–5, 28–31] and experimentally [32].

Despite such extensive research, there remains an as
yet unresolved fundamental question: How is the uni-
versal 4-body physics related to the RG limit cycle? In
the following, we answer this question by showing that

FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of the energy spectrum of four
identical bosons near the scattering resonance. The abscissa
shows the inverse s-wave scattering length a−1 and the ordi-
nate shows the square root of the energy eigenvalues. The Eﬁ-
mov trimers (green-colored curves) are related to one another
by a scaling factor of 22.7, and at the scattering resonance
a = ±∞, the energies E(1)
4b of two tetramers (red-
colored curves) associated with a trimer can be related to the
trimer energy E3b by E(1)
4b /E3b ≃ 4.58,
respectively [5]. A more detailed energy spectrum can be
found in Refs. [29–31].

4b and E(2)

the hierarchical structure of the few-body clusters has a
topological origin in terms of the RG limit cycle, as we
conjectured previously [33]. In particular, we numerically
demonstrate that the one-to-two ratio between the num-
ber of Eﬁmov trimers and that of the associated 4-body
bound states can be understood in terms of topological
numbers in theory space.

Topological winding numbers of the limit cycle

The renormalization group (RG) recursively performs
a coarse graining transformation of an action, in accor-
dance with the cutoﬀ-parameter k which characterizes
the ‘resolution’ of the coarse graining. The eﬀect of the
RG transformation on the 3- and 4-body physics can be
seen from the 3- and 4-body coupling constants g3 and
g4, which are deﬁned as k-dependent particle-dimer and

The abscissa shows the logarithm of the cutoﬀ k. The blue dots and the purple diamonds show g3/2 and g4/250, where the
multiplication factors 1/2 and 1/250 are introduced to display the two ﬂows simultaneously. b, RG ﬂow in the theory space
of the 3-body and 4-body coupling constants. The abscissa shows arctan(g3/16) and the ordinate shows arctan(g4/6250),
where we use arctan to display diverging coupling constants, and g3 and g4 are multiplied by 1/16 and 1/6250 for the sake of
simultaneous display. The brown curve shows the RG limit cycle obtained by eliminating the cutoﬀ k dependence of g3 and g4
from Fig. 2a. If we glue the edges of the ﬁgure to form a torus, the limit cycle winds once in the g3 direction and twice in the
g4 direction. Thus the numbers of 3-body and 4-body bound states correspond to the topological winding numbers of the limit
cycle. c, Schematic illustration of the topological nature of the limit cycle described in Fig. 2b. The ﬁgure c is adapted from

particle-trimer scattering amplitudes, respectively. To
obtain the RG ﬂows of g3 and g4, we use the functional
renormalization group (FRG) which enables us to deal
with such strongly correlated situations as the Eﬁmov
physics.

Previous FRG analyses [34–36] on the resonantly in-
teracting 4 bosons suﬀer spurious 4-body bound states
due to the point-like approximation where the momen-
tum dependence of Green’s functions are almost disre-
garded. To avoid such an artifact, we take into account
the full momentum dependence of the Green’s functions,
with the aid of the separable pole approximation [37, 38],
which enables one to represent a Green’s function with a
tractable function.

In Fig. 2a, g3 and g4 at the scattering resonance are
plotted as functions of the cutoﬀ k, which demonstrates
that g3 and g4 both have the log-periodic k dependences
to form an RG limit cycle. Furthermore, g4 ﬂows twice
from −∞ to ∞ every time g3 ﬂows from −∞ to ∞, in-
dicating that there appear two 4-body bound states as-
sociated with one Eﬁmov trimer, since the divergence of
g3 and g4 can be identiﬁed with the appearance of the 3-
and 4-body bound states [34]. To obtain the RG ﬂow in
theory space, we have plotted g4 as a function of g3 in

Fig. 2b, by eliminating the explicit cutoﬀ k dependence
from g3 and g4. A topological feature of the limit cycle
emerges if we regard the 2-dimensional space of g3 and
g4 as a torus by gluing the opposite sides of the edges in
Fig. 2b: The brown RG limit cycle forms a closed loop,
which winds the torus twice in the g4 direction and once
in the g3 direction as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2c.
These results suggest that the universal numbers of the
3- and 4-body bound states are, in fact, the topological
winding numbers of the RG limit cycle. Our ﬁnding thus
provides the ﬁrst example of a topological nature of the
RG ﬂow in universal few-body physics. An intriguing
extension of the present results to the possible topologi-
cal phase transition in quantum few-body physics will be
discussed later.

Eﬀective ﬁeld theory of few-body physics

We now present our theoretical framework for obtain-
ing the above results. To make semi-analytic calculations
of the 4-body sector possible, we use an eﬀective ﬁeld the-
ory that exactly reproduces 2- and 3-body observables of
identical bosons with the contact (δ-function) interac-
tion. For this purpose, we consider the following action:

S[ψ, φ] :=ZP

ψ∗(P )(ip0 + p2 − µ1)ψ(P ) +ZP

where P denotes the four momentum consisting of Mat-
subara frequency p0 and momentum p, RP := R d4p
(2π)4 ,
and Gψ(P ) := (ip0 + p2 − µ1)−1. In equation (1), ψ de-
scribes a particle, and φ describes a dimer. Throughout
this paper, we employ the units  = 2m = 1, where m
(2m) is the mass of a particle (a dimer). In our model, we
have reduced the Yukawa coupling between a particle and
a dimer in the ordinary two-channel model of identical
bosons [8, 39] to the particle exchange interaction, as in
the third term on the right-hand side of equation (1). As
we show below, our model exactly reproduces the dimer
propagator and the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation
[46] for the 3-body scattering.

Topologically connected 3- and 4-body limit cycle

We

functional

employ the

and Γ(4)
k

renormalization-group
(FRG) analysis, which allows a non-perturbative RG
transformation onto the ﬂowing action Γk[ψ, ψ∗, φ, φ∗], in
which the coeﬃcients Γ(3)
of |ψφ|2 and |ψψφ|2
k
are identiﬁed with the k-dependent particle-dimer and
particle-particle-dimer correlation functions. The exact
RG ﬂow of Γk[ψ, ψ∗, φ, φ∗] is governed by the Wetterich
equation [40] (equation (5) in Methods) and the ﬂows of
Γ(3)
k and Γ(4)
can be extracted from the vertex expansion
[41] (equation (7) in Methods) of the Wetterich equation.
Concerning the 3-body sector, we can exactly solve the
FRG equation of Γ(3)
(see Fig. 3 in Methods). By focus-
k
ing on the spatially isotropic s-wave component of the
scattering amplitude, which makes the dominant contri-
bution in the low-energy Eﬁmov physics, we perform a
projection onto Γ(3)
k (ip0 =
k2 + 3µ1; p2, p1), and deﬁne the dimensionless 3-body
coupling constant by

k (p2, p1) = 2πR d cos θp2p1Γ(3)

k

g3 := −k2Γ(3)

k (p2 = 0, p1 = 0).

(2)

As in Fig. 2a, we check that g3 exhibits the log-periodic
cutoﬀ k dependence, where one period ∆ ln k ≃ ln 22.7
ﬁnds good agreement with Eﬁmov’s scaling parameter
π/s0 ≃ ln 22.6966, showing that our eﬀective ﬁeld theory
accurately reproduces the self-similarity of the Eﬁmov
physics.

Concerning the 4-body sector, we cannot perform an
exact FRG calculation of the 4-body sector, since in
the total 4-body scattering process, a complicated sub-
amplitude of particle-dimer scattering imposes a severe

restriction on the numerical calculation; however, we ﬁnd
that the FRG equation of the 4-body sector becomes
tractable if we replace the particle-dimer scattering pro-
cess by the propagation process of a relevant Eﬁmov
trimer (see Fig. 4 in Methods). By focusing on the dom-
inant s-wave component of the particle-trimer scatter-
ing amplitude T (4)
k (ip0 =
e2π/s0k2+4µ1; p2, p1), we deﬁne the dimensionless 4-body
coupling constant by

k (p2, p1) = 2πR d cos θp2p1 T (4)

g4 :=pET,k T (4)

k (p2 = 0, p1 = 0).

(3)

Like the 3-body coupling constant g3, the 4-body cou-
pling constant g4 exhibits the log-periodic k dependence
with one period of ∆ ln k ≃ ln 22.7. We ﬁnd that as g3
ﬂows from −∞ to ∞, g4 does twice from −∞ to ∞,
reﬂecting that there appears two 4-body bound states
associated with one Eﬁmov trimer. Indeed, by evaluat-
ing the energies of an Eﬁmov trimer and the associated
two tetramers from the values of the cutoﬀ k = k3b and
k = k(1)
4b at which g3 and g4 diverge, respectively, we
ﬁnd the following relations:

4b , k(2)

k(1)
4b

= 1.11,

k(2)

which agree reasonably with the exact ratio between the
energy of an Eﬁmov trimer and that of associated two

tetramers r E(1)

4b
E3b

= 1.00113, r E(2)

4b
E3b

= 2.14714 [30].

To obtain the RG ﬂow in theory space, we plot g4 as
a function of g3 in Fig. 2b, by eliminating the explicit
cutoﬀ k dependence from g3 and g4. As we can see in Fig.
2b, if we regard the two-dimensional space of g3 and g4
as a torus by gluing the edges, the RG limit cycle forms a
single closed loop, which winds the torus twice in the g4
direction and once in the g3 direction, clearly indicating
that the number of universal clusters corresponds to the
topological winding numbers in theory space.

Conclusion & outlook

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the numbers
of universal few-body clusters are, in fact, the topolog-
ical winding numbers of the renormalization-group ﬂow
trajectory in theory space. The one-to-two correspon-
dence in the numbers of Eﬁmov trimers and tetramers is
a consequence of the torus topology in the space of the
three-body and four-body coupling constants, where the

trajectory winds twice in the g4 direction every time it
winds in the g3 direction.

An intriguing question is a topological phase transition
in the 4-body physics. If we introduce a mass imbalance
in a 4-particle system, there is a situation in which the
number of 4-body companions accompanying an Eﬁmov
trimer changes according to the mass ratio [42]. Our
present analysis suggests that such a situation may be
regarded as a new type of topological phase transition
in theory space at which the winding number of the
renormalization-group (RG) limit cycle changes. Now
that Eﬁmov trimers are observed in mass-imbalanced
mixtures of certain atomic species [23, 24, 26], the topo-
logical phase transition in the 4-body physics should be
within experimentally reach.

Another important question that arises from the
present result is the predicted instability of the tetramers
accompanying an Eﬁmov trimer. As pointed out in
Ref. [29], a tetramer can, in principle, decay into a com-
posite of a particle and a deep Eﬁmov trimer, making the
tetramer unstable. One may think that such instability
rounds oﬀ the diverging behavior of the 4-body coupling
constant g4 by introducing an imaginary part to g4, and
thereby removes the topological feature of the RG limit
cycle. However, we ﬁnd that even if we take the insta-
bility into account by introducing a deep Eﬁmov trimer
so that a tetramer can decay into the trimer state, the
imaginary part of g4 remains zero and the divergence of
g4 survives.
In addition, if an exact analysis removes
the divergence of g4, we expect that we can still deﬁne
a topological number by using the coupling constant g4
extended to a complex value. Since in the 3-body prob-
lem, the limit cycle of complex 3-body coupling constant
g3 winds around a ﬁxed point of g3 even when we intro-
duce an artiﬁcial imaginary part to g3 [10], we expect
that the limit cycle of g4 winds around a ‘node’ deﬁned
as a parameter-space on which the beta function of g4
vanishes.

where Φ(P ) = (ψ(P ), ψ∗(P ), φ(P ), φ∗(P )), and Γk[Φ] is
the ﬂowing action, which is deﬁned as the one-particle ir-
reducible eﬀective action of the cutoﬀ k dependent action

Sk := S +RP ψ∗(P )Rψ,k(P )ψ(P )+RP φ∗(P )Rφ,k(P )φ(P )
and reduces in the high-energy limit k → Λ to the
action S and in the low-energy limit k → 0 to the
quantum eﬀective action Γ that possesses the full in-
formation of Green’s functions. The symbol Tr implies
the sum over momenta, Matsubara frequency, and ﬁeld
species. The derivative ˜∂k acts only on the regulators
RΦ,k = Rψ,k, Rφ,k, which are chosen as

To deal with the RG ﬂow of the 3- and 4-body cou-
pling constants, we perform a vertex expansion [41] of
equation (5) with respect to the ﬁeld variables to derive
the RG equations for one-particle irreducible vertices:

We ﬁrst consider the 1-, 2- and 3-body sectors sep-
aretely to obtain the limit cycle of the 3-body coupling
constant g3. We ﬁnd that the beta function of the 1-body
sector vanishes [33, 34, 39], because the self-energy cor-
rection is absent in the particle vacuum. Therefore, the
cutoﬀ k dependent 1-body inverse propagator is given by

lytically. Together with the renormalization condition

note that equation (9) is consistent with the expression

reduces in the infrared limit k → 0 to the Skorniakov-Ter-

of the scattering amplitude makes the dominant contri-
bution to the low energy Eﬁmov physics, we perform a
projection onto Γ(3)
k (ip0 =
k2 + 3µ1; p2, p1), and deﬁne the dimensionless 3-body
coupling constant by g3 := −k2Γ(3)
k (p2 = 0, p1 = 0).By
solving the FRG equation corresponding to Fig. 3c, we
obtain the exact RG ﬂow of g3.

4-body sector

Concerning the 4-body sector, we cannot perform an
exact FRG calculation since the 4-body sector requires
the knowledge of the full momentum dependence of the
particle-dimer scattering amplitude, which is too com-
plicated to deal with directly. Our strategy is to take
into account the dominant intermediate state in the to-
tal particle-dimer scattering process by making use of the
K¨all´en-Lehmann spectral representation: By focusing on
the s-wave component of the particle-dimer scattering

amplitude, we decompose −Γ(3)

− Γ(3)

k (ip0, p; p2, p1) as

(11)

where ET,k is the binding energy of an intermediate Eﬁ-
mov state and χk(p) is the Bethe-Salpeter (bound-state)
wave function of the Eﬁmov trimer. Diagrammatically,
equation (11) can be expressed as shown in Fig. 4a.
Equation (11) means that we replace the particle-dimer

scattering process by a propagation process of a relevant
Eﬁmov state. This approximation is based on the same
idea as the separable pole approximation [37, 38], which
enables us to deal with the particle-dimer scattering am-
plitude with a factorized momentum dependence as in
equation (11), and has played a crucial role in the accu-
rate computation of the quantum few-body problems.

The function χk and ET,k can be determined from the
Bethe-Salpeter (bound-state) equation which is obtained
by substituting equation (11) into the 3-body equation as
depicted in Fig. 3c. If we choose the intermediate Eﬁmov
state such that ET,k ≫ k2, the Bethe-Salpeter equation
reduces to an analytically solvable one given in Ref. [47],
and the resulting χk and ET,k are given by

the normalization factor determined through the proce-
dure developed in Ref. [48]. To take into account the rel-
evant intermediate Eﬁmov state that satisﬁes ET,k ≫ k2,
we choose the integer n(k) in equation (13) as

Based on equations (11)-(14), the 4-body sector is
greatly simpliﬁed. Following Ref. [44], we decompose
the 4-body one-particle irreducible vertex as depicted in
Fig. 4b. The resulting 4-body FRG equation can be in-
tegrated with respect to k, resulting in a simple form as
depicted in Fig. 4(d). We note that the integrated 4-body
FRG equation possesses the same structure as the Alt-
Grassberger-Sandhas equation [37, 38], except that our
equation lacks the dimer-dimer scattering process, which
is irrelevant at the unitarity limit where the dimer state
is absent. As in the 3-body sector, we perform an s-wave
projection onto T (4)
k (ip0 =
e2π/s0 k2 + 4µ1; p2, p1) and deﬁne the dimensionless 4-
k (p2 = 0, p1 =
0). By solving the FRG equation given in Fig. 4(d), we
obtain the non-perturbative RG ﬂow of g4, and thus we
obtain Fig. 2.
