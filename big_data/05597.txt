We propose a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model for ionic solvent that includes ion size eﬀects and
polarization correlations among water molecules in the calculation of electrostatic potential.
It
includes the previous Poisson-Fermi models as special cases, and its solution is the convolution of a
solution of the corresponding nonlocal Poisson dielectric model with a Yukawa-type kernel function.
Moreover, the Fermi distribution is shown to be a set of optimal ionic concentration functions in the
sense of minimizing an electrostatic potential free energy. Finally, numerical results are reported to
show the diﬀerence between a Poisson-Fermi solution and a corresponding Poisson solution.

INTRODUCTION

Ionic solutions have been studied for a very long time,
usually by using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE)
as a starting point. The PBE model has its successes
[2–4, 14, 26, 31, 37, 49, 64, 75, 76], particularly com-
pared to the treatment of ionic solutions by the theory of
ideal (uncharged) perfect gases, found in biochemistry
texts [74, 79]. But the successes of PBE are mostly
qualitative because sodium and potassium ions are not
the same (for example). Real ionic solutions have non-
ideal excess properties [23, 46] that distinguish between
types of ions (e.g., sodium and potassium) that cannot
be approximated by PBE treatments in which sodium
and potassium are identical point charges. The diﬀerent
speciﬁc properties of ions are of the greatest importance
in biology and technology [18, 21–25, 32, 39, 43–47, 60–
62, 64, 79] As Nobelist Aaron Klug (over-) states the
issue [36]: “There is only one word that matters in biol-
ogy, and that is speciﬁcity.” Both life and electrochemical
technology (e.g., batteries) depend on the diﬀerence be-
tween ions. If your nerve cells lose their ability to deal
separately with sodium and potassium ions, you die, in
minutes.

The need for more realistic theories was well known in
physical chemistry nearly a century ago and the failure
to make much progress has been a source of great frus-
tration. For example, a leading monograph, in print for
more than ﬁfty years, says “... many workers adopt a

counsel of despair, conﬁning their interest to concentra-
tions below about 0.02 M ...” [65, page 302], an opinion
restated in even more colorful language by up-to-date
references as well: “It is still a fact that over the last
decades, it was easier to ﬂy to the moon than to describe
the free energy of even the simplest salt solutions be-
yond a concentration of 0.1M or so” [44, page 10]. These
issues are discussed, and some of the innumerable ref-
erences are listed in [5, 6, 10, 17–21, 23–25, 33, 39, 43–
47, 61, 62, 65, 78, 90]. The nonideal properties of ionic
solutions arise because ions are not points of charge.
Rather, ions are charged molecules that also can inter-
act with the highly polar solvent water. Water has a
complex distribution of charge, with zero net charge but
signiﬁcant local centers of charge. Much of biology de-
pends on the properties of spherical ions that have charge
independent of the local electric ﬁeld (sodium and potas-
sium ions) or are customarily treated (with reasonable
success) as if they have charge independent of the local
electric ﬁeld (chloride and calcium ions). These bio-ions
— as they might be called because of their enormous sig-
niﬁcance to biology (documented in the classical texts of
physiology and biophysics [12, 38, 68]) — have nonideal
properties mostly because they are spheres not points
and solutions made of spheres have entropy and energy
quite diﬀerent from solutions of points. Bio-ions have
their greatest importance where they are most concen-
trated, in and near the electrodes of batteries and elec-
trochemical cells, in and near ion channel proteins, ion
binding proteins (including drug receptors), nucleic acids
(DNA and RNA of various types), and enzymes, particu-
larly their active sites [34]. Where they are most impor-

tant, ion concentrations are usually more than 10 molar,
often reaching 100 molar (!), more concentrated than ta-
ble salt Na+Cl− (37 molar). This surprising fact is the
subject of the reviews [10, 17, 25], and is documented
there for L-type calcium channels, DEKA sodium chan-
nels, and ryanodine receptor channels. Similar charge
densities are found in catalytic active sites [34] and in
Rb+ binding sites in the KcsA potassium channel [60].

In the last decades, simple treatments of ionic solutions
as spheres of ﬁxed charge in a dielectric have had surpris-
ing success in describing detailed properties of complex
systems, including bulk solutions [10, 17, 25, 57, 58] and
ion channels, starting with approximate treatments of
bulk solutions, moving to Monte Carlo simulations of all
sphere systems, culminating in a variational treatment
[22] that combines diﬀusion, migration, and convection
using the energetic variational approach pioneered by
Chun Liu [51, 70] more than anyone else.

The variational treatment, however, computes forces
between all spheres and so leads to partial diﬀerential
equations that are diﬃcult to solve even numerically in
three dimensions. Spheres cannot overﬁll space and the
resulting saturation phenomena can be dealt with by the
Fermi-like distribution derived by Jinn-Liang Liu [52],
which was then used by Liu and Eisenberg to compute
the entropy of an arbitrary mixture of spheres of any di-
ameter in various systems [53–55, 57, 58]. This Fermi-like
approach describes bulk ionic solutions, calcium chan-
nels, and the gramicidin channel (in a model based on
its three dimensional structure) with some success but it
is based on an approximate treatment of the energy and
free energy of these systems using Santangelo’s potential
model [72] that has been popularized by [9] and others
[77].

Santangelo’s model neatly encloses the near-ﬁeld cor-
relations in a far ﬁeld Poisson equation and boundary
conditions that allow ﬂow when combined with a diﬀu-
sion (Nernst-Planck) representation. The separation of
near and far ﬁelds depends on a single screening param-
eter, however, and this is clearly an over-simpliﬁcation,
perhaps with signiﬁcant limitations, particularly in the
crowded situations where ions are most important.
In
reality, the screening includes both solvent and solute ef-
fects, neither of which can be captured by a single param-
eter independent of ion concentration and type. Rather,
the screening eﬀects of other ions depend on concentra-
tion, even in the (nearly) ideal case of point charged ions,
and on the diameter of ions and the composition of their
solution in general. In addition, the attenuation by di-
electric properties of the solvent — that might be called
dielectric screening as described by the Bjerrum constant
— must be nonlocal, because the water molecules that
make up the solvent are connected by a chain of hydro-
gen bonds. A replacement of Santangelo’s model that is
nonlocal is needed, and that is what we provide here.

The study of nonlocal dielectric continuum models was
started thirty years ago to account for either the polariza-
tion correlations among water molecules or the spatial-

2

frequency dependence of a dielectric medium in the pre-
diction of electrostatics [8, 11, 13, 16, 41, 66, 71, 73].
Because of the complexity and diﬃculty in numerical so-
lution, early work was done only on a Lorentz nonlocal
model for the water solvent with charges near a half-
space or a dielectric sphere containing one central charge
or multiple charges [7, 42, 67, 80]. To sharply reduce the
numerical complexity, Hildebrandt et al. developed novel
reformulation techniques to modify the Lorentz nonlo-
cal model into a system of two coupled partial diﬀer-
ential equations (PDEs) [30], opening a way to solve a
nonlocal model numerically by advanced PDE numeri-
cal techniques [29, 81]. Motivated by Hildebrandt et al.’s
work, Xie et al. adopted diﬀerent reformation techniques
than the ones used by Hildebrandt et al. to reformulate
the Lorentz nonlocal model for water into two decoupled
PDEs, and solved them by a fast ﬁnite element algorithm
[84]. Their reformulation techniques were then applied to
the construction of a new nonlocal dielectric model for
protein in water [87] and a general nonlocal Poisson di-
electric model for protein in ionic solvent [83, 85]. In fact,
this general nonlocal Poisson dielectric model is the ﬁrst
ionic solvent model that incorporates nonlocal dielectric
eﬀects in the ﬁeld of dielectric continuum modeling. It
also provides us with a general framework for developing
various nonlocal dielectric models. As one of its applica-
tions, a nonlocal modiﬁed Poisson-Boltzmann equation
(NMPBE) has recently been derived as part of a nonlin-
ear nonlinear and nonlocal dielectric continuum model
for protein in ionic solvent [83].

However, none of the current ionic models incorpo-
rate both nonlocal dielectric eﬀects and ionic size eﬀects
due to modeling and algorithmic challenges. As the ﬁrst
step toward the direction of changing this situation, in
this paper, we propose a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi dielec-
tric model for ionic solution. We generalize Santangelo’s
model as a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model to reﬂect both
the spatial frequency of dielectric and ionic size eﬀects
in the calculation of electrostatics for an ionic solvent
containing multiple ionic species.

In particular, we show in this paper that our nonlo-
cal Poisson-Fermi model includes Santangelo’s model as
a special case, and its solution is nothing but a convolu-
tion of the solution of a nonlocal Poisson dielectric model
with a Yukawa-like kernel function, which is commonly
used in the construction of a nonlocal dielectric model.
Furthermore, we extend the Fermi-like distribution de-
rived by Liu and Eisenberg, and prove it to be optimal
in the sense of minimizing an electrostatic free energy
functional. In fact, one signiﬁcant feature of Liu’s Fermi-
Poisson treatment [56, eq. (10)] is to model interstitial
voids as a particle species. However, the size of each
void is position-dependent, which is diﬃcult to deal with
in the derivation of a Fermi-like distribution. Such a
diﬃculty has been avoided in our new Fermi-like distri-
bution, which only requires the bulk concentrations of
ions and water molecules and the radii of ions and wa-
ter molecules, due to our modiﬁcation on the traditional

electrostatic free energy functional used in the PBE study
(see [50, 59] for example).

Our new Poisson-Fermi model turns out to be a system
of n + 2 nonlinear equations — one fourth order elliptic
partial diﬀerential equation for deﬁning an electrostatic
potential function and n + 1 nonlinear algebraic equa-
tions for the concentration functions of n ionic species
and water molecules.
Its numerical solution raises a
challenge in computational mathematics and high per-
formance scientiﬁc computing particularly when conﬁned
spaces must be described by jump boundary conditions,
as in ion channels with discontinuities of dielectric prop-
erties and coeﬃcients. It will be studied in our sequen-
tial papers. In this paper, we only report numerical re-
sults on a simple nonlocal Poisson test model, whose an-
alytical solution was given in Xie et al.’s recent work
[88] as well as its convolution for a dielectric ball con-
taining multiple charges, since our purpose is to illus-
trate one major diﬀerence between the solutions of the
Poisson-Fermi and Poisson models. Here, the convolu-
tion of the solution was done with the same Yukawa-like
kernel function as the one used in our nonlocal Poisson-
Fermi model; thus, it can be regarded as a solution of
a Poisson-Fermi model even without any consideration
of ionic size eﬀects. The comparison tests were done by
using 488 point charges coming from a protein molecule
(PDB ID: 2XLZ ). The numerical results demonstrate
that the Poisson-Fermi model can have a much smoother
solution and a much smaller solution range than the cor-
responding Poisson dielectric model. Consequently, from
a suﬃcient condition that we obtain to guarantees a well
deﬁned Poisson-Femi model it implies that the Poisson-
Fermi model can be much more stable numerically than
the Poisson dielectric model in the calculation of ion con-
centrations.

We organize the remaining part of the paper as fol-
lows. In Section II, we review the nonlocal Poisson dielec-
tric model. In Section III, we present the new nonlocal
Poisson-Fermi model. In Section IV, we derive the new
nonlocal Fermi distribution. In Section V, we present a
dimensionless nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model, and a suf-
ﬁcient condition to ensure its deﬁnition. In Section VI,
we discuss one numerical stability issue related in ionic
concentration calculation. The conclusions are made in
Section VII.

II. A NONLOCAL POISSON DIELECTRIC

MODEL

We start with a short review on the derivation of a
nonlocal Poisson dielectric model. Let e denote an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld. When a ﬁxed charge density function ρ
and a polarization charge density function γ are given, e
can be simply deﬁned by Gauss’s law as follows:

ǫ0∇·e(r) = γ(r) + ρ(r)

for r = (x1, x2, x3) ∈ R3,

(1)

3

where ǫ0 is the permittivity of the vacuum. However, it
is diﬃcult to obtain γ in practice. To avoid the diﬃculty,
the classic linear dielectric theory [15, 27] has been estab-
lished based on the linear relationships of displacement
ﬁeld d and polarization ﬁeld p with e:

(a) d(r) = ǫ0ε(r)e(r);

(b) p(r) = ǫ0χ(r)e(r),

(2)

where d and p are deﬁned by

(a) ∇·d(r) = ρ(r);

(b) − ∇·p(r) = γ(r),

(3)

ε is the permittivity function, and χ is the susceptibility
function. Since e is conservative, there exists an electro-
static potential function, Φ, such that

e(r) = −∇Φ(r).

(4)

Hence, applying the above formula and (2a) to (3a), we
obtain the classic Poisson dielectric model:

(5)

is the

where Φ(r) → 0 as |r| → ∞, and ∆ =P3

It has been known that the relationship (2) depends
on a spatial frequency of a dielectric medium (see [35] for
example). To reﬂect this feature, the spatial frequency
variable of the Fourier transform can be employed to
model the spatial frequency dependence of the dielectric
response, so that the two linear relationships of (2) can
be mimicked in the Fourier frequency space as follows:

(a) bd(ξ) = ǫ0bε(ξ)be(ξ);
where bε(ξ),bχ(ξ),bd(ξ),bp(ξ), andbe(ξ) denote the Fourier

transforms of ε(r), χ(r), d(r), p(r), and e(r), respectively
[8]. Applying the inverse Fourier transform to (6), we
obtain the nonlocal relationships of d and p with e:

(b) bp(ξ) = ǫ0bχ(ξ)be(ξ),

(6)

d(r) = ǫ0ZR3
p(r) = ǫ0ZR3

ε(r − r′)e(r′) dr′,
χ(r − r′)e(r′) dr′.

(7b)

Substituting (7a) and (4) to (3a), we obtain the nonlocal
Poisson dielectric model:

− ǫ0∇·ZR3

ε(r − r′)∇Φ(r′) dr′ = ρ(r) ∀r ∈ R3,

(8)

where Φ(r) → 0 as |r| → ∞. In particular, following De-
bye’s (temporal) frequency dependent permittivity func-

where εs and ε∞ are the static and optic values corre-
sponding to the spatial frequencies |ξ| = 0 and |ξ| → ∞,

respectively, ǫs > ǫ∞, and λ is a parameter for char-
acterizing the spatial frequency of the water solvent as a
dielectric medium (or the polarization correlations of wa-

gives the commonly-used nonlocal permittivity function

ter molecules) [28, 89]. The inverse Fourier transform ofbε

ε(r) = ǫ∞δ(r) + (ǫs − ǫ∞)Qλ(r) ∀r ∈ R3,

(10)

where δ denotes the Dirac-delta distribution at the origin
[69], and Qλ is given by

Qλ(r) =

e−|r|/λ
4πλ2|r|

.

Applying (10) to (8), we obtain the nonlocal Poisson

dielectric model: For r ∈ R3,
− ǫ0 [ǫ∞∆Φ(r) + (ǫs − ǫ∞)∇·(∇Φ ∗ Qλ)(r)] = ρ(r), (11)
where Φ(r) → 0 as |r| → ∞, and ∇Φ ∗ Qλ denotes the
convolution of ∇Φ with Oλ, which is deﬁned by
Qλ(r − r′)∇Φ(r′)dr′.

(∇Φ ∗ Qλ)(r) =ZR3

Furthermore, by the derivative properties of the convo-
lution [69, Theorem 6.30, Page 171], the nonlocal Poisson
dielectric model (11) can be reformulated in the form
− ǫ0∆ [ǫ∞Φ + (ǫs − ǫ∞)(Φ ∗ Qλ)] = ρ(r), r ∈ R3. (12)
One interesting issue on the study of the nonlocal Pois-
son dielectric model comes from the selection of parame-
ter λ. Many studies were done for diﬀerent ionic solvents
and diﬀerent applications (see [5, 32, 39, 63, 90], [84, Fig-
ure 2.1], and [28, 29] for example), showing that a value
of λ can vary from 3 to 25.

While a value of λ can be selected experimentally, it
can also be estimated theoretically by a formula to yield
a reference value for experiments. To get such a formula,
we rewrite Qλ as

Qλ(r) =

1
λ2 H(r) ∀r ∈ R3 with H =

e−|r|/λ
4π|r|

,

where H is the Yukawa kernel function [40], which satis-
ﬁes the distribution equation

− ∆H(r) +

λ2 H(r) = δ(r),

r ∈ R3.

We recall that a Debye-H¨uckel equation for a symmet-

Clearly, the Debye-H¨uckel equation is reduced to (13)

Here λ has the length unit in angstroms (˚A) since (14) is
in the dimensionless form produced by using the length
unit in angstroms under the SI unit system.

By the formula (16) with the parameter values of
kB, ec, ǫ0 and T given in [82, Table 1], λ was found to
have the range 4.3 ≤ λ ≤ 30.7 for 0.01 ≤ Is ≤ 0.5 as
displayed in Figure 1. Further studies will be done on a
proper selection of λ in our sequential work.

III. THE NONLOCAL POISSON-FERMI MODEL

In this section, we derive a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi
model for computing the convolution of Φ with respect
to the Yukawa-like kernel function Qλ. We then show
that the electrostatic potential Φ can be split into two
component functions — one for permittivity correlations
among water molecules and the other one for ionic size
eﬀects.

Doing the convolution of Φ on the both sides of (13),

we ﬁnd that Φ can be expressed in the form

Φ(r) = −λ2∆W (r) + W (r),

r ∈ R3,

(17)

where we have set W = Φ ∗ Qλ, and used the derivative
identity Φ∗ ∆Qλ = ∆(Φ∗ Qλ). The above expression can
lead to a new way for us to calculate the electrostatic
potential function Φ provided that we can construct an
equation for W to calculate both W and ∆W (r) quickly.

In general, the convolution Φ ∗ Qλ can be much more
smooth than Φ without involving any singularity over
the whole space R3. For example, Figure 2 shows that
the convolution Φ ∗ Qλ has smoothed a strongly singu-
lar Φ, and sharply reduced the range of Φ. Hence, an
equation for W should be much easier to solve numer-
ically and should give a much more accurate numerical
solution than the equation of Φ.

We now produce an equation for W from the nonlocal
dielectric model (12). With (17), we can reformulate the
expression ǫ∞Φ + (ǫs − ǫ∞)(Φ ∗ Qλ) in terms of W as
follows:

ǫ∞Φ + (ǫs − ǫ∞)(Φ ∗ Qλ) = ǫsW − ǫ∞λ2∆W.
c = ǫ∞
ǫs

Let l2
λ2. Applying the above expression to the
nonlocal model (12) yields an equation for W as follows:

− ǫ0ǫs∆(cid:2)W (r) − l2

c ∆W (r)(cid:3) = ρ(r),

r ∈ R3,

(18)

where W → 0 and ∆W → 0 as |r| → ∞, which can be
followed from (17) and Φ → 0 as |r| → ∞.

As a special case, setting ǫ∞ = ǫs reduces (18) to

− ǫ0ǫs∆(cid:2)W (r) − λ2∆W (r)(cid:3) = ρ(r),

where W → 0 as |r| → ∞.
to the classic Poisson model:

Furthermore, when λ = 0, the model (18) is reduced

r ∈ R3,

(19)

− ǫ0ǫs∆Φ(r) = ρ(r) ∀r ∈ R3,

(20)

where Φ(r) → 0 as |r| → ∞.
From the above description it can be seen that the
solutions of (18) and (19) are the convolutions of the so-
lutions of nonlocal Poisson dielectric model (11) and local
Poisson dielectric model (20), respectively, with respect
to the Yukawa-like kernel function Qλ. For clarity, we
will call (18) and (19) a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model
and a local Poisson-Fermi model, respectively.

Note that our local Poisson-Fermi model (19) is a
signiﬁcant generalization of Santangelo’s fourth-order
[72] since in Santangelo’s model, the solution
model
is simply treated as an electrostatic potential function,
which is usually quite diﬀerent from W .

Clearly, with a suﬃciently large domain Ω, we can ap-

proximate (18) as the boundary value problem:

To simplify the numerical calculation, we set

Ψ = −∆W

as a new unknown function to reformulate (21) as a sys-
tem of two partial diﬀerential equations as follows:

c ∆Ψ(r) − Ψ(r)(cid:3) = ρ(r), r ∈ Ω,

∆W (r) + Ψ(r) = 0,

Ψ(s) = 0, W (s) = 0,

r ∈ Ω,
s ∈ ∂Ω.

(23)

Using (17) and the solution (Ψ, W ) of (23), we then

obtain the nonlocal electrostatic potential Φ by

Φ(r) = W (r) + λ2Ψ(r),

r ∈ Ω.

(24)

To understand the physical meaning of Ψ, we can use

the multiplication properties of convolution to get
Ψ(r) = −∆W (r) = −∆(Φ ∗ Qλ)(r) = −(∆Φ ∗ Qλ)(r)

where ∂Ω denotes the boundary of Ω.

Similar to what was done in [86], we can show that
the above boundary value problem has a unique solution,
and there exists a continuous self-adjoint positive linear
operator, L, such that the solution can be expressed in
the operator form

W = L−1ρ for ρ ∈ L2(Ω),

where Zi is the charge number of ionic species i, we can

This shows that Ψ can be used to reﬂect ionic size ef-
fects through properly selecting ci. For this reason, the
formula (24) becomes signiﬁcantly important since it has
split the electrostatic potential Φ into two component

and permittivity correlations among water molecules.

IV. A NONLOCAL FERMI DISTRIBUTION

In this section, we derive a nonlocal Fermi distribution
for an ionic solvent containing n diﬀerent ionic species,
and show that it leads to optimal ionic concentrations
in the sense of minimizing an electrostatic free energy,
which we construct as a modiﬁcation of the traditional
one commonly used in the PBE study.

Clearly, applying (26) to (22), we can express the so-
lution W of the nonlocal Poisson-Fermi equation (21) as
a function of ionic concentrations ci for i = 1, 2, . . . , n in
the operator form

W = ec

ZiL−1ci,

(27)

nXi=1

from which it implies that diﬀerent ionic concentrations
may result in diﬀerent potential functions of W . Hence,
it is interesting to search for a set of optimal ionic con-
centration functions to yield an optimal potential in the
sense of an electrostatic free energy minimization. One
key step to do so is to construct a proper electrostatic free
energy functional in terms of ionic concentration func-
tions.

To do so, we denote cn+1 as the concentration func-
tion of water molecules, and treat the ions and water
molecules as the hard-spherical balls with radius ai for
i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1. Thus, the volume of each ball is
given by 4πa3
i /3. In the ion channel study done in [57],
the interstitial voids among these balls were considered
in the calculation of ionic concentration functions. Sim-
ilarly, to reﬂect the size eﬀects of these voids, we deﬁne
two void volume fraction functions, Γb and Γ(r), respec-
tively, by the two size constrain conditions

[48, 49, 86], to select ci for i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1 optimally
as a solution of the following electrostatic free energy
minimization problem
min{F (c)|c = (c1, c2, . . . , cn, cn+1) with ci ∈ C(Ω)}, (29)
where F (c) = Fes(c) + Fid(c) + Fex(c) with Fes, Fid, and

respectively, as deﬁned by

Here, Γb and Γ must be positive, and the excess energy
is induced from the size constrain conditions of (28).

Theorem 1. The minimization problem (29) has a

in the Fermi distribution form

and Strc is deﬁned by

Strc(r) = ln(cid:18) Γ(r)

To ensure the deﬁnition of the above system, both Γ(r)
and Γb are required to be positive almost every where. In
the following theorem, we present a suﬃcient condition
to satisfy such a requirement.

Theorem 2. Let Γ(r) and Γb be deﬁned in (33).

From the above expression it can imply that F ′′(c) is
strictly positive. Hence, the the minimization problem
(29) has a unique solution. From (31) we can obtain the
expressions of (30). This completes the proof.

The term Strc is often referred to as a steric potential
since it describes ionic size eﬀects caused by the ionic size
constraint conditions (28) [57]. This is the reason why
the expression of (30) can be called a Fermi distribution.
Specially, when all the radii ai = 0, the Fermi distri-

bution is reduced to the Boltzmann distribution

ci(r) = cb

i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

In addition, setting the correlation length parameter

V. A DIMENSIONLESS NONLOCAL

POISSON-FERMI MODEL

A combination of (31) and (26) with (21) immediately
results in a system of n + 2 equations for solving the elec-
trostatic potential W and concentration functions {ci}
as follows:

s ∈ ∂Ω.



In biomolecular simulation,

length is measured in
angstroms (˚A), and ci is in moles per liter. Thus, we
need to convert ci to the number concentration (i.e., the
number of ions per cubic angstroms) by

3
ci moles per liter = ciNA10−27/˚A

.

We then reformulate both Γ(r) and Γb as follows:

Γ(r) = 1 − 4πNA

the nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model (32) is reformulated

VI. NUMERICAL STABILITY PROBLEM

However, the range constraint condition (35) may
cause a numerical stability problem in the calculation of
concentration functions. To illustrate this issue, we ﬁrst
construct two numerical algorithms, called Algorithms 1

W = Φ ∗ Qλ, and the series expressions of Φ and W
given in [88] were used to plot the top ﬁgure for Φ and
the bottom ﬁgure for W .

and 2. We then use them to show that the Poisson-Fermi
approach is very likely to improve the numerical stability
of the classic Poisson dielectric approach in the calcula-
tion of ionic concentrations.

To construct a simple iterative scheme for computing
concentration functions, we treat the nonlinear system
(34) as a diﬀerential-algebraic equation problem. That
is, the boundary value problem

If kc(k+1)

i k < η (e.g., η = 10−5), stop the

Algorithm 2 can be constructed as a modiﬁcation of

Algorithm 1 by substituting u(k) as ˆu(k) with

ˆu(k) = ecΦ(k)/(kBT ),

i=1 Zic(k)

where Φ(k) denotes a solution of the nonlocal Poisson
dielectric model (11) using the boundary condition Φ = 0

on ∂Ω and the charge density ρ(r) = ecPn

We next use Algorithms 1 and 2 to illustrate why a
Poisson-Fermi model is more favorable than the corre-
sponding Poisson model in the calculation of ionic con-
centrations. To do so, we only need to show that u(k)
has a smaller range than ˆu(k) due to the fact that the
value scale of the update c(k+1)
is mainly determined by
the factor e−Ziu(k)
in Algo-
rithms 2. We further observe that u(k) is the convolution

in Algorithm 1 or e−Zi ˆu(k)

(r).

i

of ˆu(k) with respect to the Yukawa-like kernel Qλ; thus,
u(k) can have a much smaller range than ˆu(k) since the
convolution can sharply reduce the range of a potential
function in general. Therefore, Algorithm 1 is expected
to be more stable numerically than Algorithm.

As an example, we estimated the upper bound of the
constraint condition (35) for the NaCl electrolyte.
In
this numerical test, we had n = 2, Z1 = 1, Z2 = −1, and
cb
1 = cb
2 = Is. We then set a1 = 0.95, a2 = 1.81, and
a3 = 1.4 as the radii of Na+, Cl−, and water molecule
H2O, respectively [58]. In this case, we got

0 < ci(r) < 41.6,

r ∈ Ω for i = 1, 2, 3,

conﬁrming that the range of each ionic concentration that
ensures Γ(r) > 0 can be small. Using (36), we also got

Γb > 0.56 when Is < 2.5 and cb

3 < 55.

We next calculated the solution Φ of a simple nonlocal
Poisson test model (called Model 1 in Xie et al’s recent
work [88]) and its convolution W = Φ ∗ Qλ as an exam-
ple for demonstrating that the convolution can sharply
reduce the range of Φ.

In this test, we set the solvent region Ω = (−2,−2)3 \
Dp with Dp = {r | |r| < 1}, ǫp = 2, ǫs = 80, ǫ∞ = 1.8,
and λ = 10. A set of 488 atomic charges from a protein
with 488 atoms (PDB ID: 2LXZ) were scaled to the unit
ball Dp such that each charge position has a length less
than 0.8. The series expressions of Φ and W were given in
[88]. Using them, we calculated Φ and W approximately
as a partial sum of the series with 20 terms, which was
found to have a relative error O(10−5) with respect to
the partial sum calculated by 100 terms. Here we used
the physical parameter values of ǫ0, ec, T , and kB given
in [82, Table 1].

Figure 2 shows that the Poisson-Fermi solution W is
much smoother than the Poisson solution Φ, implying
that the Poisson-Fermi model can be much easier to
solve numerically to high accuracy than the correspond-
ing Poisson dielectric model.

The ranges of W and Φ within the solvent re-
gion Ω were found to be [−0.4363,−0.2273] and
[−37.7190,−1.2484], respectively, conﬁrming that the
convolution has a much smaller range than the corre-
sponding potential function. Consequently, Algorithm 1
can be more numerically stable than Algorithm 2 under
the constrain condition (35).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

9

Poisson equation using the Santangelo equation to link
electric ﬁeld near and far from ions. The Fermi distri-
bution describes the main diﬀerence between points and
ﬁnite size ions. Finite size ions cannot overﬁll space.
Points can ﬁll space to any density including ‘inﬁnity’.

In this work, we generalize the Santangelo equation us-
ing Xie et al’s nonlocal Poisson dielectric theory, and ﬁnd
a generalization that is a convolution of previous results
with a Yukawa like potential. Our new formula for esti-
mating the nonlocal parameter λ depends on and varies
with ionic strength of various types of ions (mixtures in
solvent). This is very diﬀerent from Santagelo’s model
in which the parameter is a correlation length that is
not speciﬁcally related to ionic strength and hence does
not change with varying bulk concentrations of all ionic
species. Our nonlocal Fermi distribution is new due to
the speciﬁc ionic radius associated with the steric poten-
tial. It has been shown to be optimal in the sense of min-
imizing an electrostatic free energy, which we construct
using the bulk concentrations and ionic size constraint
conditions. We combine our general Poisson-Fermi model
with this new Fermi distribution to create a nonlocal
Poisson Fermi theory for computing both the convolu-
tion of electrostatic potential and ionic concentrations.
Furthermore, ionic concentrations are found to have lim-
ited ranges to ensure the deﬁnition of a Poisson-Fermi
model. The convolution smooths and so results are even
easier to compute than in the local theory.
It also re-
duces the range of a corresponding potential function
sharply. Hence, a Poisson-Fermi model is particularly
valuable in the development of eﬀective numerical algo-
rithms for computing ionic concentrations.

Later work will examine how well the nonlocal Pois-
son Fermi model ﬁts experimental data. Moreover, this
new model will be adapted to the study of biomolecules
(e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) and biological appli-
cations that involve ionic ﬂows and concentrated ionic
mixtures.
Indeed, the ﬂows, ionic mixtures, or (aver-
age global) concentrations occur in all biological and al-
most all technological applications. Ions tend to be con-
centrated where they are important and Liu and Eisen-
berg’s Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fermi (PNPF) model has
done surprisingly well in dealing with them. As an appli-
cation of our new nonlocal Fermi theory, we will develop
a nonlocal PNPF model for ion channel in the future.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Ions always interact in water solutions, because ions
are charged and so is water (although the net charge of
a water molecule is zero). The interactions of ions and
water and the interactions of ions with each other have
been studied extensively, ﬁrst treating ions as points. Re-
cently, the ﬁnite size of ions has been dealt with success-
fully in models that are easy to compute, both in ﬂow
and in mixtures, with a Fermi distribution coupled to a
