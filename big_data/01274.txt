Abstract

In the present paper we revisit gravitational theories which are invariant under TD-
iﬀs - transverse (volume preserving) diﬀeomorphisms and global scale transformations.
It is known that these theories can be rewritten in an equivalent diﬀeomorphism-
invariant form with an action including an integration constant (cosmological constant
for the particular case of non scale-invariant unimodular gravity). The presence of
this integration constant, in general, breaks explicitly scale invariance and induces a
run-away potential for (otherwise massless) dilaton, associated with the determinant
of the metric tensor. We show, however, that if the metric carries mass dimension
[GeV]−2, the scale invariance of the system is preserved, unlike the situation in theo-
ries in which the metric has mass dimension diﬀerent from −2. The dilaton remains
massless and couples to other ﬁelds only through derivatives, without any conﬂict with
observations. We observe that one can deﬁne a speciﬁc limit for ﬁelds and their deriva-
tives (in particular, the dilaton goes to zero, potentially related to the small distance
domain of the theory) in which the only singular terms in the action correspond to
the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. We speculate that the self-consistency
of the theory may require the regularity of the action, leading to the absence of the
bare Higgs mass and cosmological constant, whereas their small ﬁnite values may be
generated by non-perturbative eﬀects.

Introduction

It is well known that a self-consistent gravitational theory does not require invariance
under the full group of diﬀeomorphisms [1, 2]. Rather, it is enough to consider the subgroup
of the coordinate transformations with Jacobian equal to unity

x′ = F (x) ,

= 1 ,

(1)

such that J ≡(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂F

∂x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which constitute the transverse diﬀeomorphisms (TDiﬀs), also called volume preserving dif-
feomorphisms. As one might expect, theories invariant under TDiﬀs contain – in addition to
the two polarizations of the massless graviton – an extra propagating scalar mode associated
with the determinant of the metric.1 This minimalistic approach to gravitational dynamics,
once combined with the requirement of exact scale invariance, results into an interesting class
of theories (for which in what follows we will use the acronym SITDiﬀ) that were constructed
and studied in detail in [6].

The results of

[6] can be summarized as follows.

In this class of theories, the scalar
degree of freedom related to the metric determinant is identiﬁed with a massless dilaton σ
that only couples derivatively and thus evades the ﬁfth force constraints. Assuming that
the metric is dimensionless and the Lagrangian contains up to two derivatives of the ﬁelds,
the most general scalar-tensor theory that includes matter ﬁelds was presented. The form of
the action can not be completely ﬁxed; rather, it involves arbitrary functions of the metric
determinant (“theory deﬁning functions”), since this quantity behaves as a scalar under the
restricted coordinate transformations. It was shown that the invariance of the system under
dilatations

xµ → α−1xµ

and gµν(x) → gµν(α−1x) ,

(2)

with α a constant, is explicitly broken at the level of the equations of motion by an arbitrary
integration constant that appears because of TDiﬀ rather than Diﬀ invariance. This gives
rise to a run-away potential for the dilaton.
It was demonstrated that by appropriately
choosing the theory deﬁning functions, it is possible to get a theory which has interesting
implications for particle physics and cosmology.
Its particle physics sector can be made
identical to the Standard Model, whereas it is able to account for the inﬂationary period in
the early Universe and provide a natural candidate for dynamical dark energy.

In this paper we generalize the aforementioned work by investigating what are the im-
plications on the structure of these models when the metric tensor gµν has (arbitrary) mass
dimension. Usually, it is somehow taken for granted that gµν is dimensionless, whereas the
coordinates xµ carry dimensions of length. However, this is nothing more than a particular

1It is possible to eliminate this extra degree of freedom by forcing the determinant to take a constant

value, like for example in Unimodular Gravity where it is ﬁxed to be equal to one [3–5].

choice which follows “naturally” only when the Minkowski space-time is described in terms
of cartesian coordinates. Notice that this choice is certainly not the most appropriate one
when other coordinate systems are used, let alone when curved space-times are considered.
Let us carry out some elementary dimensional analysis. Although what follows is in
a sense trivial if the theory under consideration is diﬀeomorphism-invariant, the situation
changes considerably for SITDiﬀ theories, since the metric determinant is a propagating
degree of freedom that plays the role of the dilaton. By deﬁnition, [gµνdxµdxν] = [GeV]−2,
so in principle, we have the liberty to assign arbitrary dimensions – also fractional – both to
xµ and gµν, i.e.

[xµ] = [GeV]−p ,

[gµν] = [GeV]−2q ,

as long as p + q = 1. The dilatations now act on the coordinates and the metric as

xµ → α−pxµ

and gµν(x) → α−2qgµν(α−px) ,

(3)

(4)

since the scaling dimensions coincide with the mass dimensions. Of a special interest is the
case in which xµ merely label events on the manifold and the metric carries dimensions of
area

p = 0 and q = 1 .

(5)

We will see that the class of theories with p 6= 0 is equivalent to that already described
in [6]. However, the case (5) is diﬀerent.
In particular, a dilatation symmetry breaking
potential for the dilaton will be shown to be absent, an otherwise generic feature of the
theories with p 6= 0. Moreover, it is remarkable that by abandoning the prejudice of a
dimensionless metric and requiring that there are no terms with more than two derivatives
in the action,2 we can completely ﬁx its form for pure gravity without matter ﬁelds.

Next, we present how a scalar ﬁeld can be incorporated in a consistent manner. If this
ﬁeld is identiﬁed with the Standard Model Higgs boson, we end up with a phenomenologically
viable SITDiﬀ theory. As we will demonstrate, the Higgs mass as well as the cosmological
constant appear in the action in a peculiar way, diﬀerent from the other terms.

Inspired by this, we formulate a set of rules that allows us to distinguish formally the Higgs
mass and the cosmological constant from other contributions to the action based on their
behaviour when the dilaton goes to zero. Since this ﬁeld is related to the metric determinant
that now carries dimension of length, this limit potentially corresponds to vanishing length
and thus it is in a sense related to the UV regime. More precisely, we notice that when the

2It should be noted that, in principle, one can relax the requirement of having an action that contains
terms which are at most quadratic in the derivatives. To ensure absence of ghosts, the starting point in this
case should be the Horndeski theory [7], which is the most general scalar-tensor action with second order
equations of motion. The scale- and Weyl- invariant subclasses of this theory have been identiﬁed in [8]. It
would be interesting to understand what are the implications of having invariance under TDiﬀ instead of
the full group of diﬀeomorphisms, an investigation we leave for elsewhere.

This paper is structured as follows.

theory is expressed in terms of variables that are conjugate to the time and space derivatives
of the ﬁelds (canonical four-momenta [9]), then the only terms which involve inverse powers
of the dilaton – and thus are presumably singular at the UV limit – are the Higgs boson
mass and the cosmological constant. Based on that, we speculate that their absence in
the action may be a requirement of the self-consistency of the theory in the UV domain.
The smallness of the observed low energy values of the Higgs mass and of the cosmological
constant, perhaps, could be attributed to some yet unknown non-perturbative mechanism.
In Sec. 2, we construct the most general SITDiﬀ
theory that contains only the dilaton and study its properties. In Sec. 3, we demonstrate
how matter ﬁelds are introduced in this framework. We present a phenomenologically viable
model that in addition to the dilaton contains an extra scalar ﬁeld, that is identiﬁed with the
Standard Model Higgs boson. In Sec. 4, we formulate the assumptions that make it possible
to single out the presence of certain terms in the action by requiring that the theory has a
regular limit when determinant of the metric goes to zero. We present our conclusions in
Sec. 5. In Appendix A, we present for completeness the dimensionality of various geometrical
objects.

2 Pure gravity

As a warm-up exercise, we will write down the most general theory that contains at most
two derivatives of the ﬁelds and is invariant under the restricted coordinate transformations
and dilatations, which are respectively by (1) and (4). The unique action that satisﬁes these
requirements reads

S =Z d4x√g(cid:20) ζ

4(p−1) R − c1 g

2(p−1)(cid:21) ,

(6)

where ζ, c1 and c2 are dimensionless constants and the scalar curvature R is deﬁned in
Appendix A. Observe that for p = 1, the above expression becomes singular. This is a
manifestation of the fact that if we consider the standard mass (and scaling) dimension for
the metric and coordinates, it is not possible to construct SITDiﬀ theories with the metric
determinant only. This was also realized in [6].

To get a better grasp on the dynamics of this theory, it is desirable to recast it in a
form invariant under the full group of diﬀeomorphisms. Once we consider a coordinate
transformation with J 6= 1, we obtain

S =Z d4x√g(cid:20) ζ

where we deﬁned the dilaton ﬁeld σ ≡ J 2g, a scalar under diﬀeomorphisms. Some comments
are in order at this place. First of all, when the theory is written this way, its particle

spectrum can be read oﬀ immediately. It contains in total 3 degrees of freedom: the two
graviton polarizations and an additional scalar ﬁeld which is associated with the determi-
nant of the metric. Moreover, we notice the appearance of an extra term in the action
proportional to the integration constant c3, which emerged through the equations of motion,
see for example [2, 6, 10] and references therein. It should be noted that for p 6= 0 (and
equivalently q 6= 1), the resulting theories are all equivalent to the ones which were already
considered in [6]. In this case, the aforementioned constant necessarily carries dimensions
and consequently, its presence explicitly breaks the symmetry of the theory under dilatations
and produces a run-away potential for the dilaton. This is a generic feature of these models.
Hence, it seems that p = 0 is a rather special point in the phase space of the theory, since
c3 is dimensionless and the theory under consideration is exactly scale invariant.3

Let us now introduce a ﬁeld χ with canonical dimensions

χ = σ

and set

In order to eliminate the mixing between the ﬁeld and the curvature, it is convenient to
write the theory such that the gravitational part takes the standard Einstein-Hilbert form
and all non-linearities are moved to the scalar sector. To this end, we perform the following
change of variables

Jordan frame has manifested itself as an (exact) shift symmetry

φ → φ + constant ,

(16)

when the theory was written in the Einstein frame. Thus, instead of the typical symmetry-
breaking exponential potential for the ﬁeld, we got a contribution to the cosmological con-
stant term. This is a novel feature of SITDiﬀ theories with dimensionless coordinates.

Including matter ﬁelds

In the present section we wish to generalize the SITDiﬀ theory we constructed previously
by showing how matter ﬁelds can be incorporated into this setup. Let us start by introducing
another scalar h with canonical mass dimensions.

We saw that the theory presented previously was completely determined by requiring
invariance under TDiﬀ and scale transformations, see (1) and (4), respectively. When we
bring into the game an extra scalar ﬁeld, the situation changes. The dimensionless quantity

h2g− 1

4(p−1) ,

(17)

is invariant under both TDiﬀ and dilatations. Therefore, arbitrary functions of the above
can in principle appear in the action. As in the previous section, we restrict ourselves
to terms that are at most quadratic in the derivatives of the various ﬁelds. Dimensional
analysis dictates that the gravitational and scalar sectors of the action that possess the
desired properties read

Here Fi and V are arbitrary functions that can only depend on the dimensionless combina-
tion (17). For later convenience, we have also included the constants ζ, c1, c2 and δ. We now
consider a transformation with J 6= 1 and introduce σ = J 2g, to recast the action into its
diﬀeomorphism-invariant form

4(p−1)(cid:17) gµν∂µσ∂ν h

(19)

4(p−1)(cid:17) + c3 σ−1/2i .

We should stress once again, that unless p = 0, the above theory is completely analogous to
the one presented in [6], in which the term proportional to c3 explicitly violates the invariance
of the theory under scale transformations. Also, like in the purely gravitational theory, the
limit p = 1 is peculiar. In the two-ﬁeld case, however, the presence of the extra scalar makes
it possible to construct SITDiﬀ theories even if the dimensionality of the metric is zero.

Before moving on, we would like to mention that the inclusion of gauge ﬁelds and fermions
in the present framework goes along the same lines as in [6]. Since here we are interested
solely on the gravitational and scalar sectors of the SITDiﬀ theories, the interested reader is
referred to this work for an extensive discussion on the subject.

3.1 Higgs-dilaton cosmology from TDiﬀ

The presence of gravity in the theory under consideration, makes it non-renormalizable.
Hence, it should be thought of as an eﬀective ﬁeld theory which is valid up to some energy
8(p−1) . In this case, if the
scale. Let us assume that for energies well below this cutoﬀ, h ≪ σ
the various functions are analytic in their argument, we can Taylor expand them as

1

Fi(h2σ− 1
V (h2σ− 1

4(p−1) ) ≈ 1 + fi h2σ− 1
4(p−1) ) ≈ 1 + αh2σ− 1

4(p−1) + . . . ,
4(p−1) + βh4σ− 1

2(p−1) + . . . ,

(20)

where the ellipses denote higher order terms, and fi, α, β are constants that depend on the
structure of the particular function. Plugging the above into (19) and keeping the leading
terms, we see that for p = 0, the action becomes

(23)

Notice that once we identify the scalar ﬁeld h with the Higgs boson (in the unitary gauge),
then for δ = 0 the above bears resemblance to the phenomenologically viable Higgs-dilaton
cosmological model that was constructed in [10, 13] and studied in great detail in [14–17].
There are however certain diﬀerences which should be pointed out. First of all, in the present
context, we need not introduce the ﬁeld χ ad hoc, since this degree of freedom is already
present in the gravitational sector. Moreover, as we mentioned before, a symmetry breaking
potential is absent. This means that contrary to what happens in theories for which p 6= 0,
the scale symmetry of the system remained intact when it was cast into a form invariant
under the full group of diﬀeomorphisms. Finally, it is interesting to note that the way
this theory is derived here is much simpler as compared to the conventional SITDiﬀ, where
complicated theory deﬁning functions have to be chosen [6].

4 Regularity?

The fact that the Higgs boson mass and the cosmological constant terms are much smaller
with respect to the Planck scale, might be an indication that at the level of fundamental
action both of them are zero. It is reasonable to wonder whether it exists some underlying
principle or mechanism that forbids the presence of these terms in the action.

Inspection of (21), reveals that due to the peculiar way the dilaton appears, all terms in
the action that involve this ﬁeld seem to be ill-deﬁned when σ → 0, arguably related to the
high energy limit. As we will demonstrate in this Section, this is not the case if the theory is
expressed in terms of variables conjugate to space and time derivatives of the ﬁelds. These
momentum densities were ﬁrst introduced by Schwinger [9] (see also [18]) and should be
though of as the covariant counterparts of canonical momenta. For a theory described by a
Lagrangian L [φi, ∂µφi] which depends on a set of ﬁelds φi and their derivatives ∂µφi, these
quantities are deﬁned as

π µ
i ≡

δL
δ∂µφi

.

(24)

Let us focus now on (21) and set δ = 0, such that there is no kinetic mixing between the Higgs
and the dilaton. This is purely for convenience, since the results will not be qualitatively

7

diﬀerent from the case where the mixing term is present, whereas the manipulations simplify
considerably. For our purposes, it is necessary to cast the action in such a way that it only
contains ﬁrst derivatives of the metric. A straightforward calculation along the lines of the
one in [19] for the Einstein-Hilbert action, gives us

the only terms that blow up are the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. Therefore,
it is tempting to speculate that both these terms should not be included in the action at the
ﬁrst place, if we want the theory to remain regular at the UV limit. It is interesting to note
that the pathological behaviour of the cosmological constant persists for arbitrary metric
dimensions, the reason being that it is always proportional to σ− 1
2 . On the other hand, if p
is not chosen to be equal to zero, the Higgs mass term as well as the term proportional to
2(p−1) (which does not feed into the cosmological constant unless p = 0), are singular only
σ
if p < 1.

Even though we do not have an answer of what is the origin of this selection rule, it could
be a manifestation of some yet unknown mechanism at very high energies. Notice that if a
scale-invariant regularization scheme is used (see for example [13]), then these terms cannot
be generated at any order in perturbation theory. It may well be the case that they emerge
from non-perturbative physics, something that can explain their smallness.

5 Conclusions

The purpose of this paper was to investigate a previously unexplored region of the pa-
rameter space of theories with dilatational symmetry and whose gravitational sector is con-
structed by requiring invariance under the group of transverse diﬀeomorphisms. Due to the
invariance under this restricted group of coordinate transformations, the determinant of the
metric becomes a dynamical degree of freedom which can be thought of as a dilaton.

We argued that the most appropriate and natural option for the description of arbitrary
coordinate systems is the metric to have dimensionality of area. We demonstrated that the
particular setup is distinct from the ordinary theories in a number of aspects. The form of the
pure gravitational action is completely ﬁxed, and moreover, once diﬀeomorphism-invariance
is restored via the St¨uckelberg mechanism, the scale symmetry remains intact. As a result,
there is no run-away potential for the dilaton.

Next, we investigated the form of the action of a model that on top of the dilaton
contains an extra scalar ﬁeld which we identiﬁed with the Standard Model Higgs boson.
Based on the way the dilaton appears and interacts with the Higgs ﬁeld, we observed that
the Higgs mass and cosmological constant are the only singular terms in the speciﬁc limit
(ﬁxing the proper variables which we deﬁne) involving metric determinant going to zero. An
appealing hypothesis is that these terms should not be included in the fundamental theory,

10

but rather their low-energy presence should result from non-perturbative eﬀects through
some yet unknown mechanism.

It would be interesting to understand how these considerations can be applied to theories
without Lorentz invariance, like for example in Hoˇrava-Lifshitz gravity (see for example [20]),
a version of which has recently been proven to be renormalizable [21].

A Dimensional Analysis

When the metric gµν is dimensionful, the operation of lowering and raising indices has to
be done with some care, since covariant and contravariant tensors carry diﬀerent dimensions.
For example, the inverse metric gµν has dimensions of [GeV]2q. Moreover, for the metric
determinant g ≡ − det(gµν) > 0, we obtain

whereas from (3), it follows that

[g] = [GeV]−8q ,

[∂µ] = [GeV]p .

We are now in position to determine the dimensionality of various geometrical quantities.
First of all, for the Christoﬀel symbols which are deﬁned as

[Rµν] = [GeV]2p ,

[R] = [GeV]2(p+q) = [GeV]2 .
