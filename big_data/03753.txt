AN EXPLICIT WALDSPURGER FORMULA

FOR HILBERT MODULAR FORMS

NICOL ´AS SIROLLI AND GONZALO TORNAR´IA

Abstract. We describe a construction of preimages for the Shimura map on Hilbert
modular forms, and give an explicit Waldspurger type formula relating their Fourier
coeﬃcients to central values of twisted L-functions. Our construction is inspired by
that of Gross and applies to any nontrivial level and arbitrary base ﬁeld, subject to
certain conditions on the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalues and on the weight.

Introduction

Computing central values of L-functions attached to modular forms is interesting
because of the arithmetic information they encode. These values are related to Fourier
coeﬃcients of half-integral weight modular forms and the Shimura correspondence, as
shown in great generality in [Wal81]. For classical modular forms, explicit formulas of
Waldspurger type can be found in [Gro87], [BSP90], among other works. In the Hilbert
setting there are Waldspurger type formulas available in [Shi93], [BM07]. More explicit
formulas for computing central values in terms of Fourier coeﬃcients can be found in
[HI13] in the case of trivial level, and in [Xue11] where the result is restricted to modular
forms of prime power level over ﬁelds with odd class number. In [CST14] the authors
give a formula in terms of heights, in the case of parallel weight 2.

In this article we prove a formula relating central values of twisted L-functions at-
tached to a Hilbert cuspidal newform g to Fourier coeﬃcients of certain modular forms of
half-integral weight, which are constructed explicitly as theta series and map to g under
the Shimura correspondence. Our result applies to any nontrivial level and arbitrary
base ﬁeld, and to a broader family of twists that the one considered in [Xue11]. In the
classical case it is more general than [Gro87] and [BSP90], where the authors consider
prime and square-free levels respectively.

Let g be a normalized Hilbert cuspidal newform over a totally real number ﬁeld
F , of level N ( OF , weight 2 + 2k and trivial central character. For each p | N
denote by εg(p) the eigenvalue of the p-th Atkin-Lehner involution acting on g, and let
W− = {p | N : εg(p) = −1}. We make the following hypotheses on W− and k.

H1. |W−| and [F : Q] have the same parity.
H2. vp(N) is odd for every p ∈ W−.
H3. (−1)k = 1.

For D ∈ F + denote by LD(s, g) = L(s, g)L(s, g ⊗ χD) the Rankin-Selberg convolution
L-function of g by the quadratic character χD associated to the extension F (√−D)/F ,
normalized with center of symmetry at s = 1/2. The main result of this article is stated
in Theorem 5.3; in the simpler form given by Corollary 5.7 it claims that there exists a
Hilbert cuspidal form f of weight 3/2 + k whose Fourier coeﬃcients λ(D, a; f ) satisfy

LD(1/2, g) =

cD

Dk+1/2 |λ(D, a; f )|2 ,

under certain assumptions on D and a. Here cD is an explicit positive rational number
depending only on D. If L(1/2, g) 6= 0 then f 6= 0 and it maps to g under the Shimura
correspondence. Actually, in this case we construct a linearly independent family of
preimages for the Shimura correspondence, as shown in Corollary 5.6.

This article is organized as follows. In Section 1 we state some basic facts about the
space of quaternionic modular forms. In Section 2 we show how to obtain half-integral
weight Hilbert modular forms out of quaternionic modular forms, and give a formula for
their Fourier coeﬃcients in terms of special points and the height pairing on the space of
quaternionic modular forms. In Section 3 we relate central values of twisted L-functions
to the height pairing, using results of [Zha01] and [Xue06] about central values of Rankin
L-functions. In Section 4 we state an auxiliary result, needed for the proof of the main
result of this article, which we give in Section 5.

Acknowledgements. The ﬁrst author would like to thank both IMERL and CMAT,
Universidad de la Rep´ublica, for hosting him during the postdoctoral stay in which this
article was written.

Notation summary. We ﬁx a be a totally real number ﬁeld F of discriminant dF ,
with ring of integers OF . We denote by JF the group of fractional ideals of F , and
we write Cl(F ) for the class group, and hF for the class number. We denote by a the
set of embeddings τ : F ֒→ R, and we let F + = {ξ ∈ F : τ (ξ) > 0 ∀τ ∈ a}. Given
k = (kτ ) ∈ Za and ξ ∈ F , we let ξk =Qτ∈a τ (ξ)kτ . By p we always denote a prime ideal
of OF , and we use p as a subindex to denote completions of global objects at p. Given
an integral ideal N ⊆ OF we let ω(N) = |{p : p | N}|. Given p we denote by πp a local
uniformizer at p, and we let vp denote the p-adic valuation.
Given a totally imaginary quadratic extension K/F we let OK be the maximal order,
and let DK ⊆ OF denote the relative discriminant. We denote tK = [O×K : O×F ], and we
denote by mK ∈ {1, 2} the order of the kernel of the natural map Cl(F ) → Cl(K).
Given a quaternion algebra B/F we denote by N : B× → F × and T : B → F
the reduced norm and trace maps, and we use N and T to denote other norms and
traces as well. We denote by bB =Q′p Bp and bB× =Q′p B×p the corresponding restricted
products, and we let B∞ = Qτ∈a Bτ . Finally, given a level N ⊆ OF , an integral or
half-integral weight k and a Hecke character χ, we denote by Mk(N, χ) and Sk(N, χ)
the corresponding spaces of Hilbert modular and cuspidal forms.

1. Quaternionic modular forms

Let B be a totally deﬁnite quaternion algebra over F . Let (V, ρ) be an irreducible
unitary right representation of B×/F ×, which we denote by (v, γ) 7→ v · γ. Let R be
an order of (reduced) discriminant N in B. A quaternionic modular form of weight

ρ and level R is a function ϕ : bB× → V such that for every x ∈ bB× the following

transformation formula is satisﬁed:

ϕ(uxγ) = ϕ(x) · γ

∀ u ∈ bR×, γ ∈ B× .

The space of all such functions is denoted by Mρ(R). We let Eρ(R) be the subspace
of functions that factor through the map N : bB× → bF ×. These spaces come equipped
with the action of Hecke operators Tm, indexed by integral ideals m ⊆ OF , and given by

Tm ϕ(x) = Xh∈ bR×\Hm

ϕ(hx) ,

where Hm =nh ∈ bR : bOF N (h) ∩ OF = mo.
Given x ∈ bB×, we let
bRx = x−1bR x,
Rx = B ∩ bRx,
The sets Γx are ﬁnite since B is totally deﬁnite. Let Cl(R) = bR×\bB×/B×. We deﬁne
an inner product on Mρ(R), called the height pairing, by
hϕ, ψi = Xx∈Cl(R)

wxhϕ(x), ψ(x)i .

Γx = R×x /O×F ,

wx = |Γx| .

The space of cuspidal forms Sρ(R) is deﬁned as the orthogonal complement of Eρ(R)
with respect to this pairing.
Let N (bR) = {z ∈ bB× : bRz = bR} be the normalizer of bR in bB×. We let fBil(R) =
bR×\N (bR)/F ×. We have an embedding Cl(F ) ֒→ fBil(R). The group fBil(R), and in
particular Cl(F ), acts on Mρ(R) by letting (ϕ · z)(x) = ϕ(zx). This action restricts to
Sρ(R), and is related to the height pairing by the equality

hϕ · z, ψ · zi = hϕ, ψi .

The action of fBil(R) commutes with the action of the Hecke operators. The adjoint of
Tm with respect to the height pairing is given by ϕ 7→ Tm ϕ · m−1.
The subspaces of Mρ(R) and Sρ(R) ﬁxed by the action of Cl(F ) are denoted by
Mρ(R, 1) and Sρ(R, 1). Let Bil(R) = bR×\N (bR)/bF ×. Then Bil(R) acts on Mρ(R, 1)
and Sρ(R, 1), and we have a short exact sequence
(1.1)

1 −→ Cl(F ) −→ fBil(R) −→ Bil(R) −→ 1 .

Forms with minimal support. Given x ∈ bB× and v ∈ V , let ϕx,v ∈ Mρ(R) be the

quaternionic modular form given by

ϕx,v(y) = Xγ∈Γx,y

v · γ ,

where Γx,y = (B×∩ x−1bR×y)/O×F . Note that ϕx,v is supported in bR×xB×. Furthermore,

we have that

ϕuxγ,v = ϕx,v·γ−1
ϕx,v · z = ϕz−1x,v

∀ u ∈ bR×, γ ∈ B×,
∀ z ∈ fBil(R) .

2. Half-integral weight modular forms and special points

From now on we specify the representation (V, ρ). Let k = (kτ ) ∈ Za

≥0 . For each
τ ∈ a we consider the real vector space Wτ = Bτ /Fτ , with inner product induced by the
totally positive deﬁnite quadratic form − ∆(x) = 4N (x) − T (x)2. By letting B×τ /F ×τ
act on Wτ by conjugation we get an orthogonal representation. Then B×τ /F ×τ acts on
Symkτ (HomR(Wτ , C)), the space of homogeneous polynomials on Wτ of degree kτ with
coeﬃcients in C. We let Vkτ denote the B×τ /F ×τ -submodule of harmonic polynomials with
respect to − ∆. This is, up to isomorphism, the unique irreducible unitary representation
of B×τ /F ×τ of dimension 2kτ + 1. We let Vk = ⊗τ∈aVkτ , and through the embedding
B× ֒→ B×∞ we get an irreducible unitary representation (Vk, ρk) of B×/F ×. We denote
the corresponding spaces of quaternionic modular forms by Mk(R), etc.
Denote by H the complex upper half-plane. Let eF : F × Ha → C be the exponential
function given by eF (ξ, z) = exp(cid:0)2πiPτ∈a τ (ξ) zτ(cid:1). Given x ∈ bB×, let Lx ⊆ B/F be

The following two propositions extend the results about theta series from [Sir14,

Section 4] to arbitrary weights.

Proposition 2.3. Let x ∈ bB× and let P ∈ Vk. Then ϑx,P ∈ M3/2+k(4N, χ1), where
χ1 is the Hecke character associated to the extension F (√−1)/F . Furthermore, for
D ∈ F + ∪ {0} and a ∈ JF , the D-th Fourier coeﬃcient of ϑx,P at the cusp a is given by

λ(D, a; ϑx,P ) =

P (y) ,

N (a) Xy∈AD,a(x)

where AD,a(x) = {y ∈ a−1Lx : ∆(y) = −D}.
Proof. Let B = {v1, v2, v3} be a basis of B/F such that there exist a1, a2, a3 ∈ JF
satisfying Lx = ⊕3
i=1ai vi . Let S ∈ GL3(F ) be the matrix of the quadratic form ∆ with
respect to this basis. For each τ ∈ a write τ (S) = −At
τ Aτ , with Aτ ∈ GL3(R). Then
there exist homogeneous harmonic polynomials Qτ (X) of degree kτ such that

P (y) = Yτ∈a

Qτ (Aτ τ ([y]B)) ,

where we denote by [y]B the coordinates of y with respect to the basis B. For each
τ we may assume that Qτ (X) = (zt
τ zτ = 0 (see
[Iwa97, Theorem 9.1]). Let ρτ = −(A−1
τ τ (S) ρτ = 0. Let
σ : F 3 → C be the function given by σ(ξ) = Qτ∈a(ρt
τ τ (S) τ (ξ))kτ , and let η : F 3 → C
be the characteristic function of a1 ⊕ a2 ⊕ a3. Then we have that ϑx,P = f , where f is
the function given by

τ X)kτ , with zτ ∈ C3 such that zt
τ zτ )t. Then we have that ρt

f (z) = Xξ∈F 3

η(ξ) σ(ξ) eF (ξt S ξ, z/2) .

The modularity of ϑx,P follows by applying [Shi87, Proposition 11.8] to the function f .
Finally, (2.4) follows as in the case k = 0 considered in [Sir14, Proposition 4.4].
(cid:3)

We use the theta series ϑx,P to deﬁne a linear map ϑ : Mk(R) → M3/2+k(4N, χ1),

given by ϑ(ϕx,P ) = ϑx,P . This map is well deﬁned by (1.4) and (2.2), and satisﬁes

Note that if Hypothesis H3 does not hold, then ϑ = 0 by (2.1).

Proposition 2.5. The map ϑ is Hecke-linear, and satisﬁes that

Furthermore, ϑ(ϕ) is cuspidal if and only if ϕ is cuspidal.

ϑ(ϕ · z) = ϑ(ϕ) ∀ z ∈ fBil(R) .

Proof. For z ∈ fBil(R) we have, by (1.3) and (2.2), that

ϑ(ϕx,P · z) = ϑ(ϕz−1x,P ) = ϑ(ϕx,P ) .

The Hecke-linearity was proved in [Sir14, Theorem 4.11] when k = 0, and can be proved
in this setting following the same lines. The assertion on the cuspidality was proved in
[Sir14, Theorem 4.11] when k = 0, and in the remaining cases follows from the facts
that Mk(R) = Sk(R) and that every theta series is cuspidal.
(cid:3)
From now on D denotes an element in F +, and we denote K = F (√−D). Assume
that there exists an embedding K ֒→ B, which we ﬁx. Let PD ∈ Vk be the polynomial
characterized by the property

P (ω) = hP, PDi

(2.6)
where ω ∈ K/F is such that ∆(ω) = −D. Note that ω is uniquely determined up to
sign. By Hypothesis H3 we have P (−ω) = P (ω) for every P ∈ Vk, which implies that
PD does not depend on ω. Since (P · a)(ω) = P (ω) for every a ∈ K×, we have that

∀ P ∈ Vk ,

PD · a = PD ∀ a ∈ K×/F ×.

Proposition 2.8. The polynomial PD satisﬁes

Proof. We have that PD = ⊗τ∈aPD,τ , where PD,τ ∈ Vkτ is the polynomial characterized
by the property

Pτ (ω) = hPτ , PD,τi

∀ Pτ ∈ Vkτ .

Identifying Bτ with Hamilton quaternions h1, i, j, ijiR and letting X1 = i/2, X2 = j/2,
X3 = ij/2, we have that {X1, X2, X3} is an orthonormal basis for Wτ with respect to
∈ Symkτ (HomR(Wτ , C)) are orthogonal, and
− ∆. Then the monomials X a
have norm equal to a! b! (kτ − a − b)!, which implies that the inner product h , i we
consider on Vkτ is related to the inner product hh , ii considered in [Geb09, Section 4.1]
by h , i = kτ ! hh , ii. Hence (2.9) follows from the explicit formulas for the Gegenbauer
polynomials given in [Geb09, Proposition 4.1.9], which imply that

Given a ∈ JF , we say that the pair (−D, a) is a discriminant if there exists ω ∈ K
with ∆(ω) = −D such that OF ⊕ a ω is an order in K. In this case it is the unique order
in K of discriminant Da2, and in particular it does not depend on ω. We denote it by
OD,a. We say that the discriminant (−D, a) is fundamental if OD,a = OK .
Proposition 2.11. Let O be an OF -order in K. Then there exists a unique a ∈ JF such
that (−D, a) is a discriminant with OD,a = O.
Proof. Let r be an OF -linear retraction for the embedding OF ֒→ O, which we extend
to a F -linear map r : K → F . Let ω′ ∈ K be any element satisfying ∆(ω′) = −D,
and let ω = ω′ − r(ω′). Then, since ω /∈ F , we have that ker r = F ω. Hence letting
a = (O ω−1)∩F we have that O = OF ⊕a ω. Note that the ideal a is uniquely determined
since Da2 is the discriminant of O.
Proposition 2.12. Let p be a prime ideal. If (−D, a) is a discriminant then (−D, pa)
is a discriminant, and the converse is true if p ∤ 2 and D ∈ a−2.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is trivial. To prove the converse, assume that OF ⊕ pa ω
is an order in K, with ∆(ω) = −D. In particular, we have that T (ω) ∈ (pa)−1 and
N (ω) ∈ (pa)−2. Since p ∤ 2, there exists ξ ∈ OF such that 1 − 2ξ ∈ p. Then, changing ω
by ω − ξ T (ω), we may assume that T (ω) ∈ a−1.
In particular, since
T (ω) ∈ a−1 we have that 4N (ω) ∈ a−2. Since p ∤ 2 and N (ω) ∈ (pa)−2 we have that
N (ω) ∈ a−2, which allows us to conclude that OF ⊕ a ω is an order in K.
Let (−D, a) be a discriminant, and let eXD,a = {x ∈ bB× : OD,a ⊆ Rx}. We deﬁne a
set XD,a of special points associated to the discriminant (−D, a) by

By hypothesis we have that ∆(ω) = T (ω)2 − 4N (ω) ∈ a−2.

then

because in this case Ox = OK for every x ∈ XD,a. It can be proved that ηD,a does not
depend on the choice of the embedding K ֒→ B. When there does not exist such an
embedding, we let ηD,a = 0.
Proposition 2.14. Let ϕ ∈ Mk(R). Let D ∈ F + and let a ∈ JF . Then the D-th
Fourier coeﬃcient of ϑ(ϕ) at the cusp a is given by

Fix ω ∈ K with ∆(ω) = −D, and let Γx act on AD,a(x) by conjugation. Given y ∈
AD,a(x), since ∆(y) = ∆(ω), we can assume there exists γ ∈ B× such that y = γωγ−1.

By analogy with the case F = Q (see [Koh82]), we consider the plus subspace of

M3/2+k(4N, χ1) which, under Hypothesis H3, is given by

3/2+k(4N, χ1) = M+

λ(D, a; f ) = 0 unless (−D, a) is a discriminant(cid:9) ,
and we let S +

the action of the Hecke operators in terms of Fourier coeﬃcients (see [Shi87, Proposition
5.4]) together with Proposition 2.12 it is easy to prove that M+
3/2+k(4N, χ1) is stable
by the Hecke operators Tp with p ∤ 2.
Corollary 2.16. The Hecke-linear map ϑ sends Mk(R) into M+

3/2+k(4N, χ1).

3. Height and geometric pairings

We start this section by comparing the geometric pairing on CM-cycles of [Zha01] (see

[Xue06] for the case of higher weight) with the height pairing introduced in Section 1.

Let K/F be a totally imaginary quadratic extension. As in Section 2 we assume that
there exists an embedding K ֒→ B, which we ﬁx. Furthermore, we assume OK ⊆ R. Let
C = (bB×/bF ×)/(K×/F ×), and let π : bB×/bF × → C denote the projection map. We ﬁx a
Haar measure µ on bB×/bF ×. On K×/F × we consider the discrete measure, and we let
¯µ be the quotient measure on C. We write µR = µ(cid:0)bR×/bO×F (cid:1).
We consider the space D(C) of CM-cycles on C. These are locally constant functions on
C with compact support. This space comes equipped with the action of Hecke operators

Given v ∈ V which is ﬁxed by K×/F ×, we let Mv : B×/F × → C be the matrix

Mv(γ) = Mv(γ−1). We call Mv a multiplicity function. We let kv : C × C → C be the

where for x, y ∈ bB× we denote Γ′x,y = (B×∩x−1bF ×bR×y)/F ×. We consider the geometric

Then ξζ−1η = vu−1 ∈ bF × ∩ bR× = bO×F , and hence ξ = ζ in Cl(F ).
Proposition 3.4. Let x, y ∈ bB×. Then kv(x, y) =Pξ∈Cl(F ) hϕξx,v , ϕy,vi.
Given a ∈ bK×, we let αa ∈ D(C) be the characteristic function of π(cid:0)bR×a(cid:1) ⊆ C. Since
OK ⊆ R, the CM-cycle αa depends only on the element in Cl(K) determined by a. The
same holds for the quaternionic modular form ϕa,v by (1.2).
Proposition 3.5. Let m ⊆ OF be an ideal. For a, b ∈ Cl(K) we have that

quaternion algebra B, letting it ramify exactly at the archimedean primes and at W−,
which is possible due to Hypothesis H1. Let Tg be a polynomial in the Hecke operators
prime to N giving the g-isotypical projection.

The following result is [Xue06, Theorem 1.2], which was originally proved for parallel

Remark 3.11. The proof given in [Xue06] is valid for a particular order in B containing
OK . Since by [Gro88, Proposition 3.4] any two orders in B containing OK are locally
conjugate by an element of bK×, and the right hand side of (3.9) is invariant by such a
conjugation, Theorem 3.8 holds for any order in B containing OK .

let PD ∈ Vk as in (2.6). Then

and sk is given by (2.10).

Proof. Let M∞ : B×∞/F ×∞ → R denote the multiplicity function considered in [Xue06,
(3.9)]. Note that MPD factors through B×∞/F ×∞, since the representation (ρk, Vk) does.
Furthermore, MPD and M∞ are, locally, the matrix coeﬃcient of the (up to multiplication
by scalars) unique vector in Vkτ ﬁxed by the action of K×τ /F ×τ —the ﬁrst claim follows by
deﬁnition; for the second, see [Xue06, Lemma 3.13]. This implies M∞ = M∞(1)
MPD (1) MPD .
but using M∞ instead of MPD , we

Since hh , ii is deﬁned in the same fashion as h , iPD

have that

hh , ii =

.

Since M∞(1) = Qτ∈a rkτ and MPD (1) = hPD, PDi, this together with (2.9) completes

the proof.

Proposition 4.3. Let p be a prime ideal of F , and let Bil(Rp) = R×p \N (Rp)/F ×p .

(1) If p ∤ N, then Bil(Rp) is the trivial group.
(2) If p | N, then Bil(Rp) is a group of order two generated by the equivalence class
of an element wp ∈ Rp ∩ N (Rp) which, in terms of the identiﬁcations given by
(4.1) and (4.2), is given by

proof is valid in the general case.

(cid:3)

From these local facts and (1.1) we get the following statement.

group of order hF 2ω(N).

Proposition 4.4. The group Bil(R) is isomorphic to Qp|N Z/2Z, and fBil(R) is a ﬁnite
Let D ∈ F +. Let K = F (√−D). By Proposition 2.11 there exists a unique a ∈ JF
such that (−D, a) is a fundamental discriminant. Since a is determined by D, we omit
it in the subindexes for the rest of this section.
As in Section 3, we assume that there exists an embedding K ֒→ B such that OK ⊆ R,
i.e. such that 1 ∈ eXD. There is a left action of fBil(R) on XD, induced by the action of
N (bR) on eXD by left multiplication. There is a right action of Cl(K) = bO×K\bK×/K× on
XD, induced by the action of bK× on eXD by right multiplication.
Lemma 4.5. Let XD,p = {xp ∈ B×p

p Rpxp = OKp}.

: Kp ∩ x−1

(1) The action of O×Kp\K×p on R×p \XD,p is free.
(2) XD,p = N (Rp)K×p .

Proof.

Then ap = x−1

(1) Let ap ∈ K×p and xp ∈ XD,p be such that there exists up ∈ R×p with xpap = upxp.
p upxp ∈ Kp ∩ x−1
(2) Given xp ∈ XD,p, let Qp = x−1

p R×p xp = O×Kp
p Rpxp. Since Rp and Qp contain OKp and have the
same discriminant, by [Gro88, Proposition 3.4] there exists ap ∈ K×p such that
a−1
p Rpap = Qp. Then xp ∈ N (Rp)ap.

(cid:3)

.

Lemma 4.6. Let p | N. Let wp ∈ N (Rp) be as in Proposition 4.3. If wp ∈ R×p K×p , then
the extension Kp/Fp is ramiﬁed.
Proof. Write wp = up ap with up ∈ R×p and ap in K×p . Then ap ∈ OKp. Using the explicit
description of wp given in Proposition 4.3 we see that πp ∤ ap in OKp. Furthermore, we
see that πp | T (ap),N (ap) in OFp, hence πp | a2
p in OKp. Thus πp is ramiﬁed in Kp. (cid:3)

AN EXPLICIT WALDSPURGER FORMULA FOR HILBERT MODULAR FORMS

As a consequence of these lemmas and Proposition 4.3 we obtain the following result.

Proposition 4.7. The group Cl(K) acts freely on XD, and the action of Bil(R) on
XD/ Cl(K) is transitive. Furthermore, the latter action is free if (DK : N) = 1.

Let ηD ∈ Mk(R) be as in (2.13) and let ψPD ∈ Mk(R, 1) be as in (3.6). We conclude

this section by relating these quaternionic modular forms.

Proposition 4.8. Assume that (DK : N) = 1. Then
ψPD · z .

ηD = Xz∈Bil(R)

In particular, ηD ∈ Mk(R, 1)Bil(R).
Proof. Since 1 ∈ eXD, using (1.3) and Proposition 4.7 we get that
tK Xx∈XD

tK Xz∈Bil(R) Xa∈Cl(K)

Xz∈Bil(R)

ψPD · z = 1

ϕz−1a,PD = 1

ϕx,PD = ηD .

The following statement follows from this result and Proposition 4.4.
Corollary 4.9. Assume that (DK : N) = 1. If ϕ ∈ Mk(R, 1)Bil(R), then

hϕ, ηDi = 2ω(N)hϕ, ψPDi .

Let k ∈ Za

≥0, let N ( OF be an integral ideal, and let g ∈ S2+2k(N, 1) be a normalized
cuspidal newform with Atkin-Lehner eigenvalues εg(p) for p | N, as in the introduction.
Let E denote the set of functions ε : {p : p | N} → {±1} satisfying
(5.1)

ε(p)vp(N) = εg(p)

∀ p | N .

Note that this set is not empty. This is equivalent to Hypothesis H2.

Given D ∈ F + we let K = F (√−D), and we denote by χD the Hecke character
corresponding to the extension K/F . Given ε ∈ E we say that D is of type ε when
χD(p) = ε(p) for all p | N. In particular DK is prime to N. Hypothesis H1 implies that
for such D the sign of the functional equation for LD(s, g) equals 1.
As required by Theorem 3.8, let B be the quaternion algebra over F ramiﬁed exactly
at the archimedean primes and at W−, which is possible by Hypothesis H1. Fix ε ∈ E ,
and let R = Rε ⊆ B be an order with discriminant N and Eichler invariant e(Rp) = ε(p)
for every p | N. Such order exists by (5.1), and belongs to the class of orders considered
in Section 4. Let ϕε ∈ Sk(R, 1) be a quaternionic modular form in Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence with g.

Lemma 5.2. The quaternionic modular form ϕε is ﬁxed by the action of Bil(R).

Proof. Let p be a prime dividing N, and let wp be the generator for Bil(Rp) given
in Proposition 4.4. By the Hecke-linearity and injectivity of the Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence, if B is ramiﬁed at p then ϕε · wp = −εg(p) ϕε = ϕε, and if B is split at
p then ϕε · wp = εg(p) ϕε = ϕε. Then the result follows, since {wp : p | N} generates
Bil(R).

where hg, gi is the Petersson norm of g, c(k) is as in Corollary 3.12, and C(N) is as in

Theorem 5.3. Let fε = ϑ(ϕε) ∈ S +

where a ∈ JF is the unique ideal such that (−D, a) is a fundamental discriminant, cD is
the positive rational number given by cD = m 2
K N (a), and λ(D, a; fε) is the D-th Fourier
coeﬃcient of fε at the cusp a.

Remark 5.5. Hypothesis H1 implies that the sign of the functional equation for L(s, g)
equals (−1)k. If Hypothesis H3 does not hold, then both sides of (5.4) vanish trivially,
since ϑ = 0 and L(1/2, g) = 0. In particular (5.4) still holds, but it can not be used to
compute L(1/2, g ⊗ χD). This issue will be addressed in a future work by the authors.
Proof. Let Tg be the polynomial in the Hecke operators prime to N giving the g-isotypical
projection. Let ψPD and ηD be as in Corollary 4.9. Since Tg ψPD is the ϕε-isotypical pro-
jection of ψPD we have that Tg ψPD = hψPD ,ϕεi
ϕε. Combining this with Proposition 2.14,
hϕε,ϕεi
Corollary 4.9 and Lemma 5.2 we get that

hTg ψPD , ψPDi = |hψPD , ϕεi|2

22ω(N) hϕε, ϕεi

Then (5.4) follows from Corollary 3.12.

Corollary 5.6. Under the hypotheses above, assume that L(1/2, g) 6= 0. Then fε 6= 0
and it maps to g under the Shimura correspondence. Moreover, the set {fε : ε ∈ E } is
linearly independent.

In particular, this proves [Sir14, Conjecture 5.6].

Proof. By hypotheses H1 and H3 the sign of the functional equation for L(s, g) equals
1. Hence by [Wal91, Th´eor`eme 4] for every ε ∈ E there exists Dε ∈ F + of type ε with
Dε = DF (√−Dε) odd and prime to N such that L(1/2, g ⊗ χDε) 6= 0. Then by (5.4) we
have that λ(Dε, aε; fε) 6= 0, where (−Dε, aε) is the discriminant satisfying Dεa2
ε = Dε.
This, together with the Hecke-linearity of the map ϑ, proves the the ﬁrst assertion. The
second assertion follows from the fact that if ε′ 6= ε then λ(Dε, aε; fε′) = 0.
(cid:3)

We say that D is permitted (with respect to g) if it is of type ε for some ε ∈ E .

Shimura correspondence.

In particular, this proves [RTV14, Conjecture 2.8].
