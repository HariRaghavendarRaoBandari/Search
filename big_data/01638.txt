Abstract

In this paper we propose a scale invariant search strategy for hadronic top or bottom plus
missing energy ﬁnal states. We present a method which shows ﬂat eﬃciencies and background
rejection factors over broad ranges of parameters and masses. The resulting search can be easily
recast into a limit on alternative models. We show the strength of the method in a natural
SUSY setup where stop and sbottom squarks are pair produced and decay into hadronically
decaying top quarks or bottom quarks and higgsinos.

Introduction

Supersymmetric models predict the existence of scalar partners (squarks and sleptons) to the
fermions of the Standard Model.
In particular, stops and left-handed sbottom squarks need to
be light in order to solve the Hierarchy problem of the Higgs boson mass. Consequently, Searches
for stops and sbottoms are at the core of the ongoing LHC program. However, despite intense eﬀorts,
see e.g. [1–38], they remain elusive, resulting in stringent limits by dedicated searches performed by
both ATLAS [39–46] and CMS [47–54].

The interpretation of a new physics search requires a model hypothesis against which a mea-
surement can be tensioned. Lacking evidence for superpartners and clear guidance from theory,
apart from naturalness considerations, it makes sense to employ search strategies that make as few
assumptions on the model as possible. For most reconstruction strategies a trade-oﬀ has to be
made between achieving a good statistical signiﬁcance in separating signal from backgrounds and
the applicability to large regions in the model’s parameter space. Hence, experimental searches are
in general tailored to achieving the best sensitivity possible for a speciﬁc particle or decay, leaving
other degrees of freedom of interest unconsidered. This approach can lead to poor performance for
complex models with many physical states and couplings, e.g. the MSSM and its extensions. Hence,
a reconstruction that retains sensitivity over wide regions of the phase space, thereby allowing to
probe large parameter regions of complex UV models, is crucial during the current and upcoming
LHC runs. However, since the number of possible realizations of high-scale models exceeds the num-
ber of analyses available at the LHC, tools like ATOM [55–57], CheckMate [58], MadAnalysis [59]
or FastLim [57] and SModels [60] have been developed in recent years to recast existing limits on
searches for new physics. A method that shows a ﬂat reconstruction eﬃciency despite kinematic
edges and population of exclusive phase space regions would be particularly powerful to set limits
on complex models allowing for broad parameter scans.

In this paper we develop a reconstruction strategy for third-generation squarks that accumulates
sensitivity from a wide range of diﬀerent phase space regions and for a variety of signal processes1.
The proposed reconstruction is therefore a ﬁrst step towards an general interpretation of data,
i.e. recasting. As a proof of concept, we study stop and sbottom pair production, followed by a
direct decay into a hadronically decaying top or a bottom and a neutralino or chargino, see Fig. 1.
In our analysis we use simpliﬁed topologies, including only sbottom and stops as intermediate SUSY
particles and we focus on jets and missing energy as ﬁnal state signal. While this example might

it might not capture long decay chains that arise if the mass spectrum is
more elaborate, this setup is motivated by naturalness [62–64], i.e. it resembles spectra with light
stops, higgsinos and gluinos with all other SUSY particles decoupled [65].

Figure 1: Generic Feynman diagram for stop production and decay. The initially produced squarks in our
setup can be any of the two stops or the lighter sbottom. They decay subsequently into a top or a bottom
and a higgsino, such that the electric charge is conserved.

To be more speciﬁc, within this simpliﬁed setup the shape of the event depends strongly on the
mass diﬀerence between the initially produced squarks and the nearly mass degenerate higgsinos in
comparison to the top quark mass Q = (m˜q − m˜h)/mt. We can identify three regions in the physical
parameter space leading to distinctly diﬀerent topologies.

1. Q < 1: The only accessible two-body decay of the produced squark is the decay into a bottom
quark and a charged higgsino. Possible three-body decays contribute only in small areas of
the parameter space.

2. Q (cid:38) 1: The decay into a top quark and a higgsino can become the main decay channel for
the produced squark, depending on the squark and the parameter point. The top quark of
this decay will get none or only a small boost from the decay and thus its decay products
might not be captured by a single fat jet. However, the intermediate W boson can lead to a
two-prong fat jet that can be identiﬁed by the BDRS tagger [66].

3. Q (cid:29) 1: If the squark decays into a top quark the latter will be very boosted and its decay
products can no longer be resolved by ordinary jets. Yet they can be captured by one fat jet and
subsequently identiﬁed as a decaying top by the HEPTopTagger [67, 68]. The HEPTopTagger
was designed to reconstruct mildly to highly boosted top quarks in ﬁnal states with many
jets, as anticipated in the processes at hand. However, other taggers with good reconstruction
eﬃciencies and low fake rates in the kinematic region of Q (cid:29) 1 (see e.g. [69–71] and references
therein) can give similar results.

2

Because the value of Q is unknown and the event topology crucially depends on it, a generic
reconstruction algorithm that is insensitive to details of the model needs to be scale invariant,
i.e. independent of Q. Hence, it needs to be able to reconstruct individual particles from the
unboosted to the very boosted regime.

Apart from scanning a large region of the parameter space, such an analysis has the advantage
that it captures the ﬁnal state particles from the three possible intermediate squark states ˜t1,2
and ˜b1, even if they have diﬀerent masses. Therefore the eﬀective signal cross section is increased
compared to a search strategy which is only sensitive to speciﬁc processes and within a narrow mass
range. In order to preserve this advantage we furthermore apply only cuts on variables that are
independent of Q or the mass of one of the involved particles.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give details on the parameter
space that we target and the signal and background event generation. Section 3 contains a thorough
description of the reconstruction of the top quark candidates and the proposed cuts as well as the
results of the analysis. We conclude in Section 4.

2.1 Signal sample and parameter space

As explained in the previous section, not only ˜t1 but also ˜t2 and ˜b1 production contributes to the
1,2 and
a top or bottom quark. Since in our simpliﬁed topology setup we assume the higgsinos to be mass

will be the same and the diﬀerent cross section for this topology can be obtained by rescaling with
appropriate branching ratios.

We consider the following points in the MSSM parameter space. At ﬁxed At = 200 GeV and
tan β = 10 we scan in steps of 50 GeV over a grid deﬁned by µ ≤ mQ3, mu3 ≤ 1 400 GeV for the two
values of µ = 150, 300 GeV. The gaugino masses as well as the other squark mass parameters are
set to 5 TeV while the remaining trilinear couplings are set to zero. For each grid point we calculate
the spectrum and the branching ratios with SUSY-HIT [72].

3

Since the squark production cross section only depends on the squark mass and the known
branching ratios we can now determine which event topologies are the most dominant. In the left
column of Fig. 2 we show for µ = 300 GeV the relative contribution to the total SUSY cross section,
σS ¯S. In the
deﬁned as the sum of the squark pair production cross sections σSUSY ≡
right panels we show in color code the coverage deﬁned as the sum of these relative contributions.
The larger the coverage the more of the signal cross section can be captured by looking into these
channels. Clearly considering only the decay of both squarks to top quarks and higgsinos is not
enough as the parameter space with Q < 0 is kinematically not accessible. Moreover in the mQ3 >
mu3 half of the space this ﬁnal state misses large parts of the signal since the lighter stop decays
dominantly into bottom quarks and charginos.

(cid:80)

S=˜t1,˜t2,˜b1

In the case where all three ﬁnal states are taken into account, the coverage is nearly 100%
throughout the parameter space, except along the line m˜t1 ≈ mt + m˜h where the top decay channel
opens up. There it drops to 70–80%, because in this narrow region also the direct decay to a W

boson ˜t1 → W + b +(cid:101)χ0 has a signiﬁcant branching ratio.

For all parameter points we generate events for each of the up to nine signal processes using
MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, version 2.1.1 [73] at a center of mass energy √s = 13 TeV. No cuts are applied
at the generator level. The matching up to two jets is done with the MLM method in the shower-kT
scheme [74, 75] with PYTHIA version 6.426 [76]. We set the matching and the matrix element cutoﬀ
scale to the same value of mS/6 where mS is the mass of the produced squark. We checked and
found that the diﬀerential jet distributions [77] are smooth with this scale choice. The cross section
for the signal processes is eventually rescaled by the NLO QCD and NLL K-factors obtained from
NLL-fast, version 3.0 [78–80].

2.2 Background sample

In our analysis we use top tagging methods based on jet substructure techniques. We therefore
focus on the decay of the squarks into a neutralino and a bottom quark or a hadronically decaying
top quark. The latter will generate between one to three distinct jets and the former will generate
missing energy. Our ﬁnal state therefore consists of missing energy and up to six jets. As background
we thus consider the following four processes, all generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.1.1
[73] and showered with PYTHIA version 6.426 [76].

• W j: pp → W(cid:96) + (2 + X)jets, where we merge up to 4 jets in the ﬁve ﬂavor scheme and
demand that the W decays into leptons (including taus), such that the neutrino accounts for

• Zj: pp → Zν + (2 + X)jets, where we merge up to 4 jets in the ﬁve ﬂavor scheme and the Z
decays into two neutrinos and hence generates missing energy. In both channels W j and Zj
we demand missing transverse energy of at least 70 GeV at the generator level.

• Zt¯t: pp → Zν + t + ¯t, where both top quarks decay hadronically, faking the top quarks from
the squark decay and the Z decays again into two neutrinos to generate missing energy. This
cross section is known at NLO QCD [81] and rescaled by the corresponding K-factor.

• t¯t: pp → t¯t + jets, where one top decays hadronically and the other one leptonically to emit
a neutrino, which accounts for missing energy. The NNLO+NNLL QCD K-factor is obtained
from Top++ version 2.0 [82] and multiplied with the cross section.

3 Analysis

3.1 Reconstruction

For the reconstruction of the events we use ATOM [55], based on Rivet [83]. Electrons and muons
are reconstructed if their transverse momentum is greater than 10 GeV and their pseudo-rapidity
is within |η| < 2.47 for electrons and |η| < 2.4 for muons. Jets for the basic reconstruction are
clustered with FastJet version 3.1.0 [84] with the anti-kt algorithm [85] and a jet radius of 0.4 .
Only jets with pT > 20 GeV and with |η| < 2.5 are kept. For the overlap removal we ﬁrst reject jets
that are within ∆R = 0.2 of a reconstructed electron and then all leptons that are within ∆R = 0.4
of one of the remaining jets. All constituents of the clustered jets are used as input for the following
re-clustering as described below.

The underlying idea behind the reconstruction described in the following is to cover a large
range of possible boosts of the top quark. We therefore gradually increase the cluster radius and
employ successively both the HEPTop and the BDRS tagger. This allows us to reduce background
signiﬁcantly while maintaining a high signal eﬃciency.

A ﬂowchart for the reconstruction of the top candidates with the HEPTopTagger is shown in
Fig. 3. First the cluster radius is set to R = 0.5 and the constituents of the initial anti-kt jets are
re-clustered with the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) algorithm [86, 87]. Then for each of the obtained
jets we check if its transverse momentum is greater than 200 GeV and if the HEPTopTagger tags
it as a top. In this case we save it as candidate for a signal ﬁnal state and remove its constituents

6

from the event before moving on to the next jet. Once all jets are analyzed as described above we
increase the cluster radius by 0.1 and start over again with re-clustering the remaining constituents
of the event. This loop continues until we exceed the maximal clustering radius of Rmax = 1.5 .

After the reconstruction with the HEPTopTagger is ﬁnished we continue the reconstruction of
the top candidates with the BDRS tagger as sketched in Fig. 4. We choose our initial cluster
radius R = 0.6 and cluster the remaining constituents of the event with the Cambridge-Aachen
algorithm. Since we now only expect to ﬁnd W candidates with the BDRS Tagger and need to
combine them with a b-jet to form top candidates the order in which we analyze the jets is no
longer arbitrary. Starting with the hardest C/A jet we check if its transverse momentum exceeds
200 GeV, its invariant mass is within 10 GeV of the W mass, and the BDRS Tagger recognizes a
mass drop. In the case that one of the above requirements fails we proceed with the next hardest
C/A jet until either one jet fulﬁlls them or we ﬁnd all jets to fail them. In the latter case we increase
the cluster radius by 0.1 and repeat the C/A clustering and analyzing of jets until the radius gets
greater than Rmax = 1.5. Once a jet fulﬁlls all the previous criteria we need to ﬁnd a b-jet to create
a top candidate. To do this we recluster the constituents of the event that are not part of the
given jet with the anti-kT algorithm and a cone radius of 0.4 and pass them on to the b-tagger2.
2For the b-tagger we mimic a tagger with eﬃciency 0.7 and rejection 50. We check if a given jet contains a bottom

Starting with the hardest b-jet we check if the combined invariant mass of the W candidate and

candidate and its constituents are removed from the event. The remaining constituents of the event
are reclustered with the C/A algorithm and the procedure repeats. Alternatively, if all b-jets fail

the results of the b-tagger in the memory and reuse them each time it gets a previously analyzed jet. This way we
avoid assigning diﬀerent tagging results to the same jet.

signal ﬁnal state as well.

3.2 Analysis cuts

After having reconstructed the candidates for the hadronic ﬁnal states of the signal — top candidates
and b-tagged anti-kT jets — we proceed with the analysis cuts. As our premise is to make a scale
invariant analysis, we must avoid to introduce scales through the cuts. We propose the following
ones.

1. Zero leptons: The leptons or other particles that are emitted by the decaying chargino
or second lightest neutralino are too soft to be seen by the detector. Moreover, since we
focus on the hadronic decay modes, no leptons should be present in the signal events. In the
Background however, they are produced in the leptonic decays which are necessary to generate
missing energy. We therefore demand zero reconstructed electrons or muons.

2. Exactly two candidates: The visible part of the signal process consists of two hadronic
ﬁnal states as deﬁned above. In the rare case that an event contains more but in particular
in the cases where an event contains less than these two candidates it is rejected. This means
that no b-jets beyond possible b candidates are allowed.

3. ∆φ((cid:126)pT ,c1 + (cid:126)pT ,c2, /(cid:126)ET ) > 0.8π: Since we cannot determine the two neutralino momenta
individually, it is impossible to reconstruct the momenta of the initial squarks. Yet, we
can make use of the total event shape. In the signal, the transverse missing energy is the
combination of the two neutrino momenta and therefore balances the transverse momenta of
the two candidates. Consequently the vectorial sum of the candidate’s transverse momenta
(cid:126)pT,ci has to point in the opposite direction of the missing energy.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) / /ET < 0.5: This cut is based on the same reasoning as the previous

one. The absolute value of the summed candidate’s transverse momenta and the missing
transverse energy needs to be small. In order to maintain scale invariance we normalize the
result by /ET .

5. ∆φ((cid:126)pT ,c1, /(cid:126)ET ) < 0.9π: By this cut we demand that the missing transverse energy and the
transverse momentum of the harder of the two candidates are not back-to-back. Since the two

produced squarks are of the same type and the higgsinos are mass degenerate, the recoil of
the top or bottom quarks against the respective higgsino will be the same in the squark rest-
frame. Therefore, the two neutralinos should contribute about equally to the missing energy
and spoil the back-to-back orientation that is present for each top neutralino pair individually.
We therefore reject events where one top candidate recoils against an invisible particle and
the second candidate does not. Moreover we can thus reject events where the missing energy
comes from a mismeasurement of the jet momentum.

6. ∆φ((cid:126)pT ,c2, /(cid:126)ET ) < 0.8π: This cut exploits the same reasoning as the previous one.

In the left plot in Fig. 7 we show the relative contribution of the types of the two ﬁnal state can-
didates after all cuts. In the samples with heavy stops and sbottoms the HEPTopTagger contributes
between 30-40% of the candidates. In the samples with lighter squarks and thus less boosted objects
the HEPTopTagger ﬁnds less candidates and the BDRS Tagger contributes up to about 15% of the
top quark candidates. However, most candidates besides the ones from the HEPTopTagger are

In Fig. 6 we show the eﬃciency of each cut for the three possible ﬁnal states as a function of
the squark mass. As anticipated they show only a mild mass dependence. This is also reﬂected in
the total eﬃciency which is very ﬂat over the whole parameter space as can be seen in Fig. 9.

3.3 Results

To continue further, we consider the mT 2 [88, 89] distribution that is shown in the right plot of
Fig. 7 (normalized) and in Fig. 8 (stacked). mT 2 is designed to reconstruct the mass of the decaying
particle and gives a lower bound on it. This is reﬂected in the plotted distribution, where the upper
edge of the signal distribution is just at the actual squark mass. For the calculation of mT 2 we
assume zero neutralino mass and use a code described in [90] and provided by the authors of this

Instead of imposing an explicit cut on mT 2 to improve S/B, mainly to the beneﬁt of the processes
involving heavy squarks, we rather evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance applying a binned likelihood
analysis using the CLs technique described in [91, 92]. For the calculation we employ the code
MCLimit [93]. We assume an uncertainty of 15% on the background cross section and also include
an error stemming from the ﬁnite size of the Monte Carlo sample. For the latter we need to combine
the pure statistical uncertainty with the knowledge of a steeply falling background distribution. To
do this we determine for each background process and each bin the statistical uncertainty ω√N,
where ω is the weight of one event and N is the number of events in the given bin. Conservatively,
we assign N = 1 for those bins which do not contain any events of the given process. In the high
mT 2 region where no background events appear this method clearly overestimates the error on the

background which is steeply falling. In addition we therefore ﬁt the slopes of the mT 2 distributions
with an exponential function and use this function to extrapolate the background distribution to
the high-mT 2 region. As uncertainty on the shape for a given background process we now take in
each bin the minimum of ω√N and three times the ﬁtted function. This way the error in the low
mT 2 range is determined by the statistical uncertainty while the one in the high mT 2 range from
the extrapolation. The combined error on the background in each bin is then obtained by summing
the squared errors of each process and taking the square root.

The results are shown in Fig. 10 (Fig. 11) for µ = 150 (300) GeV and integrated luminosities of
100, 300, and 1 000 fb−1. In Fig. 12 we show for (mQ3, mu3) = (1500, 1500) the CLs exclusion limit

sensitivity reach of the LHC, using our approach, we ﬁnd a 95% CL exclusion with 600 fb

4 Final remarks

The main idea behind this analysis was to obtain a scale invariant setup.
In the ﬁrst step we
achieved this by employing the HEPTop and BDRS Taggers together with varying radii. Thereby
we managed to pick the minimal content of a hadronically decaying top quark for a large range of
top momenta. In the second step we avoided introducing scales in the cuts and only exploited the
event properties that are independent of the mass spectrum. After this proof of concept it will now
be interesting to apply this principle to other searches where top quarks with various boosts appear
in the ﬁnal state as for example in little Higgs models with T-parity [94–96].
