ABSTRACT

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for dynamical
analysis of human actions from 3D motion capture data us-
ing topological data analysis. We model human actions us-
ing the topological features of the attractor of the dynamical
system. We reconstruct the phase-space of time series cor-
responding to actions using time-delay embedding, and com-
pute the persistent homology of the phase-space reconstruc-
tion. In order to better represent the topological properties of
the phase-space, we incorporate the temporal adjacency in-
formation when computing the homology groups. The per-
sistence of these homology groups encoded using persistence
diagrams are used as features for the actions. Our experiments
with action recognition using these features demonstrate that
the proposed approach outperforms other baseline methods.

Introduction

The rapid technological advancements in sensing and com-
puting has resulted in large amounts of data warranting the
development of new methods for their analysis. In the past
decade, topological data analysis (TDA) has shown to be a
promising new paradigm for analyzing and deriving infer-
ences [1]. In this paper, we explore the suitability of TDA
for analyzing human actions by modeling each action as a
dynamical system and extracting the topological features of
the attractor. These features are then used in a demonstrative
application of classifying actions.

The task of recognizing human activities has a wide range
of applications such as surveillance, health monitoring and
animation. Modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of human
body joints is traditionally accomplished by deﬁning a state
space and learning a function that maps the current state to
the next state [2, 3]. An alternate approach proposed de-
rives a representation for the dynamical system directly from
the observation data using tools from chaos theory [4–7],

thereby learning a generalized model representation suitable
for analyzing a wide range of dynamical phenomenon.
In
this paper, we use the framework proposed in [4, 5] to ex-
tract a reconstructed phase-space from the available time
series data, which preserves the topological properties of the
underlying dynamical system of a given action. We treat
the reconstructed attractor as a point cloud and we extract
topological features from the point cloud based on persistent
homology [8, 9].

2 Related Work

Human activity analysis is a well-studied problem in the vi-
sion community with extensive literature on the subject. We
suggest the readers to refer [10,11] for a detailed review of the
approaches for modeling and recognition of human activities.
Since our contribution in this paper is related to topological
data analysis and non-parametric approaches for dynamical
system analysis for action modeling, we restrict our discus-
sion to related methods.
Activity Analysis using Dynamical Invariants: Tradi-
tional methods for action recognition by parametric mod-
eling approaches impose a model and learn the associated
parameters from the training data. Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) [12] and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) [13] are
the most popular parametric modeling approaches employed
for action recognition [14–17] and gait analysis [2, 18, 19].
Nonlinear parametric modeling approaches like Switching
Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDSs) have been utilized to
model complex activities composed of sequences of short
segments modeled by LDS [20]. While, nonlinear approaches
can provide a more accurate model, it is difﬁcult to precisely
learn the model parameters. In addition, one would only ap-
proximate the true-dynamics of the system with attempts to
ﬁt a model to the experimental data. An alternative nonpara-
metric action modeling approach based on tools from chaos
theory, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamical
system like the largest Lyapunov exponent, correlation di-
mension and correlation integral, have been extensively used

to model human actions [4, 21–23].
Topological Data Analysis: Topological data analysis has
gained its importance in analyzing point cloud data [9], and
is seen as a tool to obtain the shape of high-dimensional
data as opposed to geometric approaches that try to under-
stand the size of the data. Such tools are also very useful
in visualization applications [24, 25]. The representations
of persistent homology such as persistence diagrams and
barcodes have several applications, such as speech signal
analysis [26], wheeze detection [27], document structure
representation [28], detection of cancer [29], characterizing
decision surfaces in classiﬁers [30] to name a few. There
are also a number of freely available software for computing
persistent homology from point clouds [31, 32].
Contributions: Our work has the following contributions:
(1) We treat the reconstructed phase-space of the dynamical
system as a point cloud and derive features based on homo-
logical persistence. (2) We incorporate links between adja-
cent time points when building simplicial complexes from the
point cloud. (3) We demonstrate the value of the proposed
framework in an action recognition task on a publicly avail-
able motion capture dataset, using a nearest neighbor classi-
ﬁer with the the persistence-based features.
Outline:
In section 3, we introduce the theoretical concepts
of phase-space reconstruction and persistent homology. The
feature which encodes the temporal evolution information in
the persistence diagrams will be introduced in section 4. In
section 5, we present our experimental results on the motion
capture dataset [4].

3 Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce the background necessary to de-
velop an understanding of nonlinear dynamical system anal-
ysis using tools from chaos theory and persistent homology.

3.1 Phase Space Reconstruction
The data that we obtain from sensors is usually a projection of
the original dynamical system to a lower dimensional space,
and hence do not represent all the variables in the system.
Hence, the available data is insufﬁcient to model the dynam-
ics of the system. To address this, we have to employ meth-
ods for reconstructing the attractor to obtain a phase-space
which preserves the important topological properties of the
original dynamical system. This process is required to ﬁnd
the mapping function between the one-dimensional observed
time series data and the m-dimensional attractor, with the as-
sumption that all variables of the system inﬂuence one an-
other. The concept of phase-space reconstruction was pro-
posed in the embedding theorem proposed by Takens, called
Takens’ embedding theorem [33]. For a discrete dynamical

system with a multidimensional phase-space, time-delay vec-
tors (or embedding vectors) are obtained by concatenation of
time-delayed samples given by
xi(n) = [xi(n), xi(n + τ ),··· , xi(n + (m − 1)τ )]T .
where m is the embedding dimension and τ is the embedding
delay. The idea here is that for a sufﬁciently large m, the
important topological properties of the unknown multidimen-
sional system are reproduced in the reconstructed phase-space
[34]. The process of phase-space reconstruction from a one-
dimensional observed time-series of a Lorenz and Rossler
system is shown in Fig 1, where the reconstructed phase-
space and the original attractor are topologically equivalent.

3.2 Persistent Homology
Consider a point cloud of T data samples in RD: X = [x1, x2,
. . . , xT ]T . The point cloud data can be viewed as samples
from a unknown shape. Our aim is to estimate the topological
properties of the underlying shape by constructing a simpli-
cial complex S using the point cloud X and examining the
topology of the complex. A simplicial complex is a set of
simplices constructed from X glued together in a particular
way. It is denoted by S = (X, Σ), where Σ is a family of non-
empty subsets of X, with each element σ ∈ Σ being a sim-
plex. The other necessary condition is that σ ∈ Σ and k ⊆ σ
implies that k ∈ Σ. The simplices are usually constructed
using some neighborhood rule, such as the −neighborhood,
where  is the scale parameter.

We are interested in computing the rank of homology
groups of a given dimension, aka, Betti numbers (β), since
they are one of the simple but informative characterizations
of topology of the point cloud. Betti−0 or β0 denotes the
number of connected components, β1, the number of holes of
dimension−1, β2, the number of holes of dimension−2 and
so on. Betti numbers depend on the scale (which is same as
the scale used with −nearest neighbors) at which the com-
plex is constructed. Homology groups that are stable across a
wide range of scale values, i.e., persistent homology groups,
are the ones that provide the most information about the un-
derlying shape. Homology that do not persist are considered
to be noise. The Betti numbers of a given dimension can be
compactly encoded in a 2−dimensional plot, which provides
the birth versus death times of each homology group, also
known as the persistence diagram. Persistence diagrams are
multi-sets of points, with inﬁnite number of points on the
diagonal where birth time equals death time. They admit
several metrics and hence distances between two diagrams
can be estimated numerically [35].

Various approaches exist for constructing simplicial com-
plexes from X at a given scale . In our work, we use the
Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex, VR(X, ), where a simplex is
created if and only if the Euclidean distance between every
pair of points is less than  [36]. Efﬁcient construction of

the VR complex can proceed by creating an -neighborhood
graph, also referred to as the one-skeleton of S. Then in-
ductively, triplets of edges that form a triangle are taken as
two-dimensional simplices, sets of four two-dimensional sim-
plices that form a tetrahedron are taken as three-dimensional
simplices, and so on. This is repeated for increasing values
of scale, known as ﬁltration, and the persistence diagrams are
estimated. Although several types of topological features can
be extracted from point clouds, in our work, we will use it to
refer exclusively to persistence diagrams.

4 Topological Features from Attractor

Although VR complexes can successfully retrieve the topo-
logical features of a general point cloud, topological features
that incorporate the dynamical evolution in phase-space can
model actions better. In this section, we present a method to
encode temporal information in persistence diagrams which

in turn can be used as a representative topological feature for
the reconstructed phase-space.

Methods to build simplicial complexes from the point
cloud data, such as the VR ﬁltration approach, only takes
into consideration the adjacency in space, but not in time.
An activity is a resultant of coordinated movement of body
joints and their respective interdependencies to achieve a
goal-directed task with temporal information in trajectories
of body joints. Modeling the underlying dynamics in the tra-
jectories forms the core idea in designing action recognition
systems. Therefore, we explicitly we create temporal links
between xi(n − 1), xi(n), and xi(n + 1) in the one-skeleton
of S, thereby creating a metric space which encodes adja-
cency in both space and time. The persistence diagrams for
homology groups of dimensions 0 and 1 are then estimated.
The pseudo code for our framework is outlined in algorithm
1.

As a demonstrative example, we use this approach to es-
timate the persistence diagrams of Lorenz and Rossler at-
tractors. From Fig. 1, we see that for the Lorenz attrac-
tor, the ranks of homology groups that persist are, β0 = 1
and β1 = 1, whereas for the Rossler attractor, β0 = 1 and,
β1 = 2. Clearly they indicate the connected components and
1−dimensional holes in each of the cases. Note that the points
close to the diagonal are considered to be noise with their
birth and death times being close to each other. Therefore
these points represent homology groups that die in a short
time after they are born.

Distance Between Persistence Diagrams: For any two
persistence diagrams X and Y , the distance between the dia-
grams are usually quantiﬁed using the bottleneck distance or
the q−Wasserstein distance [35]. In our experiments, we use

Table 1: Comparison of classiﬁcation rates for different
methods using nearest neighbor classiﬁer on the motion cap-
ture dataset.

Since each diagram contains an inﬁnite number of points in
the diagonal, this distance is computed by pairing each point
in one diagram uniquely to another non-diagonal or diagonal
point in the other diagram, and then computing the distance.
This can be efﬁciently obtained with the Hungarian algorithm
or using a more efﬁcient variant [35].

5 Experimental Results

The proposed framework for topological data analysis for
action representation was evaluated on the motion capture
dataset [4].
Baseline: To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
we provide comparative results using 10−dimensional fea-
ture vectors1 of traditional chaotic invariants obtained by con-
catenating the largest Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimen-
sion and correlation integral (for 8 values of radius). The re-
sults with this approach are denoted with Chaos in Table 1.
We also tabulate the results using persistence diagrams ob-
tained from VR ﬁltrations with no additional temporal encod-
ing (VR Complex), and a recent shape-theoretic framework
D2 and DT2 [6]. The evaluation with VR complexes follow
the same protocol as our proposed approach described below.

5.1 Motion Capture Data
We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework us-
ing 3-dimensional motion capture sequences of body joints
used in the [4]. The dataset is a collection of ﬁve actions:
dance, jump, run, sit and walk with 31, 14, 30, 35 and 48
instances respectively. The dataset provides 3−dimensional
time-series from 17 body joints which were further divided
into scalar time-series resulting in a 51-dimensional vector
representation for each action. We generate 100 random
splits having 5 testing examples from each action class and
use a nearest neighbor classiﬁer with the 1−Wasserstein dis-
tance measure. The mean recognition rates for the different
methods are given in Table 1. Traditional chaotic invariants
(Chaos) only achieves a mean recognition rate of 52.44%.
The best classiﬁcation performance reported on the dataset
uses DT2 dynamical shape feature achieves a mean recog-
nition rate of 93.92% which encodes temporal information.
In comparison, our proposed method achieves 96.48% which
is signiﬁcantly better than the results achieved by any of the
previous methods. Clearly, topological persistence features
are informative, since they summarize the feature evolution

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have proposed a novel topological feature
representation for persistent homology which encodes tem-
poral information in any given point cloud suitable for ap-
plications in action recognition. The proposed framework
addresses the drawbacks of conventional methods, by com-
bining the principles from nonlinear time-series analysis and
topological data analysis, to extract robust and discriminative
features from the reconstructed phase-space.

Since computing distances between persistence diagrams
is similar to obtaining Wasserstein distance between two
probability mass functions, a well-designed multi-resolution
approach can be used to reduce complexity, particularly in
applications where we only need approximate distances. Fur-
ther, using recently proposed persistence kernels [37] can
signiﬁcantly widen the scope of applications of topological
persistence features.
