Food webs – networks of predators and prey – have long been known to exhibit “intervality”: species can
generally be ordered along a single axis in such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on
unbroken compact intervals. Although the meaning of this axis – identiﬁed with a “niche” dimension – has
remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With
this in mind, most trophic network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value by
hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the cause but rather a consequence
of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of 46 empirical food webs, we ﬁnd that they also exhibit predator
intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous as the prey are, but in a diﬀerent
ordering. Furthermore, this property is not exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons,
metabolites, cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as interval as food webs.
We go on to show that a simple model of food-web assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can
nevertheless generate signiﬁcant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for food-web
modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental structural traits, such as trophic
coherence. We conclude that a new approach to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding
of ecosystem assembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features thought to be
speciﬁc of food webs are in fact common to many complex networks.

For decades food-web modelling has been based
on the idea of a “niche dimension”, according to
which the species in an ecosystem are considered
to be arranged in a speciﬁc order, which is tanta-
mount to the existence of a one-dimensional hid-
den dimension. This assumption is justiﬁed by
the empirical observation of a topological feature,
exhibited by many food webs to a signiﬁcant de-
gree, called “intervality”. We show here that in-
tervality is not necessarily the hallmark of a hid-
den niche dimension, but may ensue from other
food-web structural properties, such as trophic
coherence. In fact, we ﬁnd instances of networks
of genes, neurons, metabolites, cellular machines,
airports, and words which exhibit intervality as
signiﬁcant as that of food webs. These results
support a new approach to food-web modelling,
and suggest that certain features of trophic net-
works are relevant for directed networks in gen-
eral.

INTRODUCTION

Charles Darwin concluded On the Origin of Species rem-
iniscing on his famous entangled bank, “clothed with
many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the
bushes, with various insects ﬂitting about, and with
worms crawling through the damp earth, [...] so diﬀer-
ent from each other, and dependent on each other in so

complex a manner”.1 Charles Elton later developed the
concept of a food web – a network of predators and prey
– as a description for a community of species,2 and in the
eighties such systems were among the ﬁrst to be explicitly
modelled as random graphs with speciﬁc constraints.3,4
With the advent of ever better ecological data and the
explosion of research on complex networks, much work
has gone into analysing and modelling the structure of
food webs, and its relation to population dynamics and
ecosystem function.5–10 Not least among the motivations
for such research has been an awareness that the sixth
mass extinction is under way, and that we must strive to
understand ecosystems if we are to protect them.11

Field ecologists apply a variety of techniques to infer
the predation links which exist between (and sometimes
within) the dozens, or hundreds, of species making up
speciﬁc ecosystems. The results of such observations are
sets of trophic networks, or food webs, which can now
be analysed quantitatively, as we go on to do here. A
food web with S species can be encoded in an S × S
adjacency matrix A, such that the element Aij is equal
to one if species i (the predator) consumes species j (its
prey), and zero if not. In other words, a food web can
be regarded as an unweighted, directed network in which
the nodes are species and the directed edges represent
predation.

When Joel Cohen ﬁrst examined a set of such food
webs in the seventies, he discovered that they exhibited
a topological property which he named intervality: the
species could be ordered in a line in such a way that
the prey of any given predator would form a compact

interval.4,12 In terms of the adjacency matrix, this meant
that the columns could be ordered so that elements would
form unbroken horizontal blocks (see Figure 1A). This
observation re-invigorated the use of an important and
old concept in ecology: the niche. The term was origi-
nally used simply to refer to a species’ habitat13 or eco-
logical role,2 but was then deﬁned by Hutchinson as a
“position in a multi-dimensional hyperspace” – each di-
mension being some biologically relevant magnitude.14
The observed intervality of food webs suggested that
predators consume every species within a particular com-
pact hypervolume of niche space – and, moreover, that
niche space was (at least to a good approximation) one-
dimensional.7,15

Motivated by the belief that complex systems could
come about from simple rules, several models were
put forward to explain the non-trivial structure of
trophic networks. The cascade model was the ﬁrst such
attempt.3 The key idea behind this model is that food
webs reﬂect some inherent hierarchy in which certain
species are above others. Hence, species are organised
on a hierarchical (niche) axis and are constrained to con-
sume only prey which are below them.12 The approach is
loosely based on the fact that predators tend to be larger
than their prey, at least in certain kinds of ecosystem,
and so the hierarchy could be regarded as one deﬁned by
body size. The cascade model was better at reproduc-
ing food-web structure than a fully random graph, but
there were features – intervality, in particular – which it
could not account for. Then Williams and Martinez put
forward the well-known niche model,15 in which species
are again ordered along a hierarchical or niche axis, but
species are allowed to select prey now only on a contigu-
ous interval below them (not a random selection, as in the
cascade model). Thus, the niche model has intervality as
a built-in property. It also proved quite successful in ex-
plaining certain other food-webs properties, and, thanks
to its simplicity, it is often taken as the reference model
for generating synthetic food webs.16,17 The popularity
enjoyed by the niche model has served to reinforce the
belief that something akin to its niche axis does in fact
form the backbone of real ecosystems.18,19

As progressively better collections of food-web data
were gathered, it became apparent that most trophic net-
works were not perfectly interval (see Figure 1B). Mea-
sures of local “frustration” were proposed to capture the
distance from perfect intervality,21 and more recently the
degree of intervality of food webs has been measured with
several continuous quantities that take values close to
unity if most of the prey lie on unbroken intervals, or
approach zero when very few do.18,19 A simple way is to
measure, for each predator, the size of its largest unbro-
ken interval as a fraction of its total number of prey, and
use the average value over predators as a measure of the
intervality – also sometimes called contiguity – ξ of the
food web; however, since intervality is deﬁned for a given
ordering of species, some optimization method is required
to ﬁnd the most interval global ordering, much as is done

Figure 1. A) Examples of interval and non-interval “diets”.
Once species have been arranged along some hidden (niche)
axis, species A is said to have an interval diet if all their
prey occupy contiguous positions, while species B has a non-
interval diet. Diﬀerent orderings may result in diﬀerent values
of diet intervality for a given predator species. The niche or-
dering is deﬁned as the one maximizing the overall level of in-
tervality. B) Top left panel: Adjacency matrix corresponding
to the empirically obtained food web of Mondego Estuary.20
Filled squares stand for predators (vertical axis) consuming
the corresponding prey (horizontal axis); as usual, the same
ordering is used for both rows and columns. An ordering of
the species has been sought which maximizes prey-intervality,
ξ (see main text for a deﬁnition): observe that the prey of any
predator tend to be contiguous/interval. Top right panel: The
same procedure is applied to a randomised version of the net-
work which preserves both in- and out-degree sequences for
each node in the Mondego food web; observe the strong reduc-
tion in the level of intervality. Bottom left panel: The same
adjacency as in the top left panel, but this time according to
an ordering or elements which maximises predator-intervality,
η (see main text). Note that this ordering is clearly diﬀerent
from the one found in the panel above. Bottom right panel:

for magnitudes such as modularity22 or nestedness23 (see
Methods for a more precise deﬁnition). Several modiﬁca-
tions of the niche model have been proposed to overcome
the drawback of perfect intervality that the niche model
introduces by construction. Both the “generalized niche”
model24 and the “minimum potential niche” model25 re-
lax the assumption that the prey of a given predator
must form a perfectly continuous interval. The ratio-

nale is that the imperfect intervality of food webs might
be a sign that there are, in fact, more than one niche
dimension.25 Despite these developments, some kind of
niche axis is still generally thought to underlie food-web
structure.

Here, we challenge this view by appealing to three ob-

servations.

First, we highlight that predator intervality (the ex-
tent to which the predators of a given species can be
arranged on unbroken intervals;19 i.e. the predator inter-
vality of a matrix A is the prey intervality of its transpose,
AT ) seems to be as general and non-trivial a feature of
food webs as prey-intervality. While it is conceivable that
predators might “choose” their prey according to a niche
axis, how can prey simultaneously select their predators
according to a diﬀerent ordering?

Second, we show that intervality is not a feature pecu-
liar to food webs, as has usually been assumed: complex
networks of various kinds – including those of genes, neu-
rons, metabolites, cellular machines, airports, and words
– exhibit levels of both prey (column) and predator (row)
intervality similar to those of food webs. Yet it appears
far-fetched to suggest that such diverse systems all owe
their structure to some kind of hidden niche axis.

Third, we show that the recently proposed “preferen-
tial preying” model of food-web assembly, which does not
involve a niche axis, generates signiﬁcant intervality.26
This is the ﬁrst model to correctly reproduce the trophic
coherence of food webs –i.e.
the fact that species can
be assigned trophic levels and predators have a tendency
to prey upon subsets of prey which are on similar such
levels– and we ﬁnd that a degree of intervality is a by-
product of this topological feature. We go on to propose
a version of the preferential preying model, amended to
take account of phylogenetic constraints, which generates
realistic values of intervality without ﬁtting additional
parameter values.

Taken together, we believe these observations call into
question the concept of a niche dimension, whether as
an operationally useful construct for food-web modelling,
or as a reality to be uncovered in nature. We conclude
by discussing what these ﬁndings might mean for our
understanding of food-webs and other complex networks.

II. RESULTS

A.

Intervality

i = (cid:80)

Let us consider a directed network with S nodes and
L edges, deﬁned by the S × S adjacency matrix A.
As we have said, in the case of a trophic network the
nodes are species and the edges represent predation. The
in- and out-degrees of node i are kin
j Aij and
kout
j Aji, and correspond to the numbers of prey
and predators of species i, respectively; and the mean
degree is (cid:104)k(cid:105) = L/S. Basal species, or autotrophs, have
no in-coming edges, and are thus represented by nodes

i = (cid:80)

3

with kin = 0. We shall denote with B the number of
basal nodes in a given network.

The top left panel of Fig.1.B shows the adjacency ma-
trix for the food web of Mondego Estuary,20 on the At-
lantic coast of Portugal, with species ordered so as to
maximize intervality ξ (see Methods). Since there are
S! possible orderings of the columns it is not feasible in
general to perform an exhaustive search for the most in-
terval one. Therefore, we proceed as Stouﬀer et al.18 and
use a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm – described
in the Methods section. For comparison, in the top right
panel of Fig.1.B we show the best ordering for a randomi-
sation of the network which preserves kin and kout for
each node. These plots readily reveal that the empirical
food web is remarkably more interval than its randomised
counterpart. Observe, however, that the random network
exhibits a non-zero level of intervality, since this magni-
tude is deﬁned for the most interval ordering out of a
great many possible choices. It is therefore always nec-
essary to compare empirical values of intervality to the
corresponding random expectations in a null model, in
order to determine the signiﬁcance of this measurement.
In the bottom left panel of Fig.1.B we show the
same Mondego Estuary adjacency matrix, but this time
an ordering has been found which maximises predator-
intervality, η: the extent to which the predators of a
given prey species are contiguous19 (as above, the same
procedure has been applied to an ensemble of network
randomisations). The real food web is signiﬁcantly more
predator-interval, while the random graph has some de-
gree of predator-intervality (there is a preponderance of
vertical intervals).
Interestingly, the ordering of maxi-
mum predator-intervality is diﬀerent from the one yield-
ing the highest prey-intervality, as is obvious to the
naked-eye upon inspection of the two patterns. In fact,
we shall see that predator-intervality seems to be as gen-
eral and non-trivial a feature of food webs as the oft-cited
intervality ξ – which we shall henceforth refer to as prey-
intervality, to distinguish the two concepts.

We now extend this analysis to the entire database of
directed networks we are going to use throughout this
work (listed in Table I), which includes food webs, gene
transcription networks, metabolic networks, networks of
cellular signalling, the neural network of C. elegans, a
word-adjacency network, and a US airport recommen-
dation network. The two panels of Fig.2 show average
prey-intervality ξ, and average predator-intervality η, for
all networks in the database, compared to their randomi-
sations. The ﬁrst observation is that, as we can see in
Fig.1 for Mondego Estuary, and more generally in Ta-
ble I, prey-intervality is indeed a common feature of food
webs. In all cases the empirical values lie several stan-
dard deviations from the random expectations (z-score
values greater than 3 in all but 4 cases out of 46 food
webs). Similarly, food webs also exhibit signiﬁcant lev-
els of predator-intervality η. In all cases, the orderings
which maximise prey- and predator-intervality are diﬀer-
ent. What is perhaps more interesting is that intervality

does not seem to be limited to food webs; indeed, almost
all the other networks in our database show a similar
trend, with levels of both intervalities similar to those
observed in food webs.

Since the original observation that food webs tended to
be interval, the existence of a hidden “niche dimension”
has been assumed to be at the root of this deviation from
randomness. However, this explanation ﬁts ill with the
fact that food webs and other kinds of network exhibit
both prey- and predator- intervality to similar degrees of
signiﬁcance. It would seem, rather, that a more general
reason must exist which can account for this topological
feature.

B. Trophic coherence

One of the most striking characteristics of food webs
– perhaps the ﬁrst that springs to mind upon contem-
plating even a child’s drawing of an ecosystem – is the
existence of a trophic structure. At the base there are
plants, which are consumed by herbivores, which in turn
might be preyed upon by omnivores or primary carni-
vores, and so the biomass ﬂows from producers all the
way up to top predators. Ecologists quantify the posi-
tion of a species in a food web with its trophic level l,
such that basal species have l = 1, herbivores l = 2, etc.
More generally –following Levine27– one can deﬁne the
(non-integer) trophic levels in a recursive, self-consistent
way: the trophic level of a given species is equal to the
average level of its prey plus one unit. That is,

valities for diﬀerent type of networks (with respect to a null
model consisting in randomisations of each network that pre-
serve both kin and kout for each node). Empirical values of
the z-score have been averaged over all networks in each cat-
egory. It is evident that empirical values lie well outside the
random expectation, with high values of z-scores in all cases.
Intervality is therefore a non-trivial feature of many kinds of
complex network.

i > 0, or li = 1 if kin

if kin
i = 0. Observe that this
deﬁnition is easily generalizable to other types of directed
network, and each node can be assigned a trophic level
by simply solving the set of linear equations given by Eq.
(1).28 The only requirements for all nodes to have a well-
deﬁned level are that there should exist at least one basal
node (B > 0), and that every non-basal node must be on
at least one path including a basal node.29 In fact, this
deﬁnition of trophic level is similar to other measures of
centrality, such as PageRank, with the diﬀerence that the
“+1” term establishes a natural hierarchy.30

coherence parameter: q = (cid:112)(cid:104)x2(cid:105) − 1. A highly coher-

We have recently shown that the trophic structure of
a directed network can be characterised by a degree of
order we call trophic coherence.26 For this we deﬁne a
variable x for each edge, as xij = li − lj, and consider
the distribution of x over the L edges of a network. The
mean is (cid:104)x(cid:105) = 1 by deﬁnition, and the homogeneity of
the distribution is the trophic coherence of the network.
We can therefore quantify this feature simply with the
standard deviation of p(x), which we refer to as an in-
ent network (q (cid:39) 0) is one in which the nodes fall into
clear (almost integer) trophic levels, while a more ran-
dom system is less coherent (q > 0). We have shown
that trophic coherence is key to the linear stability of
food webs and, since it can invert the usually positive re-
lationship between diversity and stability, might be the
solution to Robert May’s famous paradox.26,31,32 Trophic
coherence has subsequently been found to play an impor-
tant role in directed networks of many kinds, including
those of neurons, genes, metabolites, cellular signalling,
words, P2P, trade and transportation, and this feature is
intimately related to cycles and feedback loops, graph
eigenspectra and the ubiquity of ‘qualitatively stable’
systems.28,29 Elsewhere in this issue, Klaise & Johnson
show that trophic coherence also determines the extent
and duration of spreading processes such as epidemics or
neuronal cascades.33

Networks with tunable trophic coherence can be gen-
erated with the recently proposed preferential preying
model (PPM),26 which works as follows. We begin with
B initial nodes (basal species) and no edges. New nodes
(consumer species) are added sequentially to the system
until a total of S nodes is reached. When a node en-
ters the system its in-neighbours (prey) are awarded from
among available nodes (those already in the network) in
the following way: the ﬁrst prey species is chosen ran-
domly, and the rest are chosen with a probability that
decays exponentially with the absolute trophic distance
to their initial prey (i.e. with the absolute diﬀerence of
trophic levels between its ﬁrst prey and the subsequent
ones). This probability is set by a parameter T that
determines the degree of trophic specialization of con-
sumers, and normalised so as to produce an expected
number of edges L. The lower the value of T (while
T > 0), the more the network will have a coherent trophic
structure (q ∼ 0). From the perspective of evolutionary
ecology, this simply means that if a given predator is good

at consuming species X, then its other prey are likely to
have similar trophic levels to that of X, as is observed in
nature.34

Food webs tend to be very signiﬁcantly coherent, and
this is key to their stability and other properties. How-
ever, niche-based models are not able to reproduce this
feature, and generate networks which are barely more
coherent than random graphs.26 This shows that inter-
vality is not a suﬃcient condition for trophic coherence.
Is it possible, though, that trophic coherence induces in-
tervality? Figure 3A displays an example of a maximally
coherent network (q = 0), obtained with a low T , while
ﬁgure 3B is an instance of a less coherent network (q > 0),
obtained with a high T (see also Fig.4). Beside each of
them appears its adjacency matrix, where species have
been ordered in such a way as to maximise prey interval-
ity, ξ. The maximally coherent network is also perfectly
interval, while the incoherent one has gaps which cannot
be eliminated by changing the arrangement of nodes in
any way. This trend is more clearly illustrated in Fig.4,
which shows that both prey- and predator-intervalities
decrease monotonically with T .

For an intuitive understanding of why intervality
emerges in the presence of trophic coherence, imagine
a simple food web consisting only of na predators that
prey upon a diﬀerent set of nb species. It will be more
likely that there is an ordering of the prey such that ξ is
high –or one of predators such that η is– if na and nb are
small (i.e. if the adjacency matrix contains few rows and
columns).
If a food web is perfectly stratiﬁed (q = 0)
so that species on level l are only consumed by those on

5

level l + 1, then the network can be seen as a superposi-
tion of many of these (independent) simple situations (A
will have a “modular” or block structure). Given that at
each pair of levels the number of species is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the total number S, a global ordering can
be found yielding as good a ξ as in the simple example –
or a diﬀerent ordering for as good an η. Networks that
are thus highly coherent will have higher values of both
intervalities than those lacking this structure.

C. Topological features contributing to Intervality

The reasoning described above suggests that trophic co-
herence should not be the only feature related to inter-
vality.
Indeed, as illustrated below, trophic coherence
can only account for a fraction of the total intervality
observed in empirical networks.

In general, any property which had the eﬀect of cre-
ating modularity –i.e. de-coupling certain non-zero ma-
trix elements from others, in the sense that their rows or
columns could be shuﬄed without aﬀecting the ordering
of other elements– would be conducive to higher levels
of intervality. In other words, we should expect a high
prey-intervality in networks in which nodes sharing any
in-neighbours tended to share a high proportion of them;
and the same goes for predator-intervality and shared
out-neighbours. To capture this feature, we can deﬁne
in-complementarity cin as the mean number of shared
in-neighbours over all pairs of nodes with any shared in-
neighbours; and, similarly, out-complementarity cout as
the mean number of shared out-neighbours over all pairs
of nodes with any shared out-neighbours.

We have measured the relationships between inter-
vality and several topological properties (including S,
(cid:104)k(cid:105), q and complementarities cin and cout). The cor-
relation between ξ and cin has a Pearson coeﬃcient of
r = 0.83, precisely the same as that of η and cout.
In
other words, complementarity –i.e.
the proportions of
shared in-neighbours and of shared out-neighbours– ac-
counts for approximately 70% of the variance in prey- and
predator-intervalities, respectively, across a broad range
of empirical networks. The correlations with trophic co-
herence itself are lower but still signiﬁcant (r ≈ 0.55).
The mean degree, (cid:104)k(cid:105), and the number of nodes, S, are
both negatively correlated with both kinds of intervality
(r ≈ −0.67 and r ≈ −0.45, respectively), as we would
expect from the reasoning above.

D. Modelling networks with coherence and intervality

Figure 3. A: Network generated with the preferential preying
model (PPM) with S = 12, B = 2 and T = 0 (the vertical
position of each node reﬂects its trophic level) and its corre-
sponding adjacency matrix, with rows and columns ordered to
maximize prey-intervality (ξ = 1). B: As A but for a similar
randomised network, leading to a smaller intervality ξ = 0.90.

Most past attempts to explain food-web intervality have
focused on identifying the biological factors which might
yield a niche dimension, such as body size.18,19,37 How-
ever, the work by Cattin et al.21 is diﬀerent in that
it considers the eﬀects of phylogeny, albeit within the
framework of a niche-based model. Crucially, the ex-

model (PPM)26 (N = 31 L = 68 as in the Chesapeake bay food web35,36). For each T , the reported values (crosses) are averages
over 100 independent network realisations. As T increases the generated networks are more incoherent. The Central (Right)
panel shows prey (predator) intervality ξ (η), as measured in the same networks. Discontinuous lines are just interpolations.

istence of phylogenetic relationships between species –
i.e. of common ancestry – was not modelled as a niche
axis, but as a “diet overlap” for certain pairs of species.
The thinking is that species which are closely related to
each other (phylogenetically similar) will tend to share
many of their prey. Cattin and colleagues found that
phylogenetic constraints, modelled in this way, increase
intervality21 – and subsequent empirical work has rein-
forced this connection.38,39 These results are in keeping
with the view that any mechanism with the eﬀect of mak-
ing nodes topologically similar (such as close relatives
having many shared prey or predators, in the case of
food webs) will also lead to seemingly non-random levels
of intervality. But since topologically similar nodes can
exist for many diﬀerent reasons, it is not just food webs
which exhibit intervality, but directed networks of many
diﬀerent kinds.

In the case of food webs, we know that both trophic
coherence and a phylogenetic signal are present. To ex-
plore whether these properties might be suﬃcient to ex-
plain the observed intervality, we extend the PPM to ac-
count for the eﬀect of phylogenetic relations in a simple
parameter-free way. For this we draw inspiration from
the “nested hierarchy” model of Cattin et al.,21 and de-
ﬁne a version of the PPM in which new nodes are assigned
in-neighbours (prey) according not only to their trophic
levels, as before, but also with a preference for nodes
which already share out-neighbours (predators) when-
ever possible (see Methods for a detailed description of
this model). Figure 5 illustrates the performance of this
modiﬁed PPM model compared to its original version for
the Chesapeake bay food web. In particular, we generate
networks with the modiﬁed model ﬁxing N , L and B as
in the empirical network, and choose the optimal value
of T (vertical dashed line) that leads to a value of q as
close as possible to the empirical one (horizontal dotted
line in Fig. 5). For this same value of T , the obtained
intervality ξ ﬁts quite well with its empirical counterpart
(z-score −0.22).

Observe, that while the dependence of the incoherence
parameter, q, on the only parameter, T , remains as in

the original version, the intervality ξ obtained with the
modiﬁed model is higher and much closer to the empir-
ical value. Similar results are obtained, in general, for
other trophic networks (e.g.
for Narragan bay the z-
score is −0.43, for St. Marks −1.06, and for St. Martin
−0.89), while a few exceptions exist (e.g. for the Ever-
glades marshes we obtain −6.52, indicating that in this
case our model does not account for the observed inter-
vality). Worse agreement is obtained for predator inter-
vality η; in the example of Figure 5, the corresponding
z-score is −2.04. The reason for this is that intervality is
strongly inﬂuenced by the degree sequences (see the def-
initions of ξ and η) and the PPM model –as well as its
modiﬁed variant– ﬁt the empirical in-degree distribution,
but not the out-degree one, which is the one aﬀecting η
the most.

The justiﬁcation for the proposed combination of
trophic specialization and phylogenetic relations has a
clear meaning only in the case of food webs. We leave as
an open question to determine which mechanisms akin to
these ones are at work in systems other than food webs,
or whether there are diﬀerent mechanisms which have a
similar eﬀect on intervality.

III. DISCUSSION

The niche concept has been central to ecology for many
decades.40,41 McInerny & Etienne, however, have re-
cently called into question its prominent role, arguing
that the ecological niche is often not well deﬁned, can
create needless confusion, and may not even be neces-
sary for ecology.42,43 The results we describe here are rel-
evant mainly for the niche idea as used in food-web mod-
elling. This approach has its origins in the intervality of
food webs ﬁrst reported by Cohen,12 and became ﬁrmly
established thanks to the success of Williams & Mar-
tinez’s celebrated niche model.15 All subsequent “struc-
tural” food-web models –i.e. those which attempt to gen-
erate realistic networks without modelling evolutionary
or population dynamics explicitly– have been based on

Figure 5. Figure analogous to Fig. 4 for the Chesapeake Bay food web,35,36 but employing the modiﬁed –rather than the
original– version of the PPM, which includes a preference to choose prey which already share some predators (or prey). Results
for the original PPM are also reported (light colors) for the sake of comparison. Dotted horizontal lines indicate the empirical
values as measured in the real food web, while vertical ones stand for the value of T providing the best ﬁt to q. Observe that,
while trophic coherence is not signiﬁcantly changed by this modiﬁcation to the model, the levels of intervality (ξ and η) are
clearly augmented by the eﬀect of a phylogenetic signal and become closer to the real values.

the niche model.7,16,21,24,25 Going on this, attempts have
been made to identify the niche axis with some biological
magnitude, such as body size, but no such measure has
ever been found to align completely with the orderings of
maximum intervality.19,44 It is worth noting that Ross-
berg et al.45 were able to generate interval networks in
an N -dimensional niche space provided phylogenetic re-
lationships were present, thus proving that, contrary to
general belief, a one-dimensional space was not a neces-
sary condition for the emergence of intervality. In their
model species evolution is represented as a random walker
in the N -dimensional niche space, and over time species
can go extinct or speciate into new ones. As long as new
species are close to the parent ones in niche space, the
resulting networks are highly interval.

We propose here that the intervality of food webs does
not justify invoking hidden or niche dimensions. We
have shown that food webs exhibit as much predator-
intervality as prey-intervality, which seems incompatible
with the interpretation of niche-based models. Moreover,
we ﬁnd that many diﬀerent kinds of biological and arti-
ﬁcial networks are as signiﬁcantly interval as food webs.
This means that either these various networks were all as-
sembled according to the stringent constraints of a niche-
axis analogue –which appears highly unlikely– or signif-
icant intervality need not be the hallmark of hidden di-
mensions. The latter explanation is further supported by
the strong correlation between intervality and the aver-
age proportion of shared neighbours (complementarity)
found across all networks. Finally, a one-parameter, en-
tirely niche-free network model, based on the “prefer-
ential preying”26 and the “nested hierarchy”21 models,
which emulates trophic specialization and phylogenetic
relations, yields similar levels of intervality as those ob-
served in food webs and other networks.

There are two messages to be drawn from this pa-
per. For ecologists, we cannot say whether our results
should change the interpretation of the niche concept
more broadly, but as regards food-web modelling we be-
lieve the case is clear for a new approach. The niche axis
–like Ptolemy’s epicycles, phlogiston, caloric, luminifer-

ous aether, and other constructs eventually found lacking
in empirical support– should be abandoned. This does
not mean that Williams & Martinez’s idea of food-web
complexity arising from simple rules is wrong, only that
we must update our concepts of these rules.

For the study of complex networks more generally,
these results show that there are still open questions
about the basic mechanisms behind their formation.
Shared neighbours explain 70% of the variance in inter-
vality, but whence the rest? Do other properties induce
such apparent order, or are there, after all, hidden hier-
archies underlying the architectures of certain complex
systems?28,46 The high signiﬁcance of topological prop-
erties such as intervality and trophic coherence found in
many diﬀerent kinds of system, from neural networks to
trading relations, and word graphs to gene regulatory
networks, suggests that we, like Darwin admiring the
complexity of his entangled bank, have yet much to learn
from ecosystems.

IV. METHODS

(cid:80)

Measuring intervality. Given a food web and a speciﬁed order-
ing of species O, we deﬁne the prey-intervality, ξO
i , of each predator
species i as the largest number of its prey to lie on an unbroken
interval divided by the total number of prey it has. The prey-
intervality of the ordering is then the average over all predator
species of this value, ξO = 1
i . The prey-intervality of
the food web itself is deﬁned as that of the ordering with the high-
est prey-intervality: ξ = max{ξO}O. Given that the search cannot
be made exhaustively, we implement a standard simulated anneal-
ing algorithm. For this, one begins with a random ordering O1 and
measures its prey-intervality ξO1 ; then two species are randomly
chosen and their positions in the ordering exchanged, yielding a
new ordering O2. The new prey-intervality ξO2 is calculated; and
the permutation is accepted with probability

p

where p is a temperature-like parameter, while with probability
1-P1→2 the permutation is rejected and the algorithm is iterated.
As is standard, we gradually lower p (starting with p = 0.01 and
then decreasing by a factor 0.99 after every 1000 proposed permu-
tations), and perform several runs from diﬀerent initial conditions

for each measurement. In all cases, the algorithm converges to a
unique value of ξ for a given network. The predator-intervality,
η, is obtained in an analogous way. Observe that this measure is
slightly diﬀerent from the one deﬁned by Stouﬀer et al.,18 which
is based on the “generalized niche model”; but both measures are
strongly correlated (we have found a Pearson’s coeﬃcient r = 0.82
between the two measurements over our network dataset).

Measuring complementarity. Given a food web we deﬁne
its matrix of shared prey as M = AAT , where A is the adja-
cency matrix. The element mij is the number of prey that are
shared by species i and j. Similarly, the matrix of shared preda-
tors is ˆM = AT A. The in-complementarity between i and j is
deﬁned as wij = mij /max(kin
j ), and similarly, for the out-
complementarity ˆwij = ˆmij /max(kout
). By averaging over
all possible pairs with at least one common shared in/out neigh-
bour, we determine the overall complementarities cin and cout,
respectively.

Modiﬁed Preferential preying model with phylogenetic
constraints. The original preferential preying model was designed
to generate networks with tunable trophic coherence. Here we in-
troduce an additional mechanism implementing the idea that a
predator is likely to choose prey which are similar, i.e. that share
other predators or other prey. In the standard PPM one starts with
B basal nodes and adds progressively new species, up to a total of
S. Each one selects its prey from existing network nodes, following
these rules:
i) The in-degree (kin) of species i is selected from a
Beta distribution, so as to obtain on average the same number of
links L as the empirical network to be modelled. ii) The ﬁrst prey
species (l) is randomly selected from the available ones. iii) Subse-
quent prey (j) are chosen with a probability Pil that decays with
the trophic distance between j and l:

Pil ∼ exp(−|sj − sl|

T

),

where T is a “temperature” parameter that sets the degree of
trophic specialization. In this version of the PPM, in order to in-
clude an additional preference for phylogenetically related species
as done by Cattin et al.21, we modify rule iii) as follows. First we
chose a prey j as above and consider all other possible prey with
the same trophic level (plus/minus 1%) and from this group we
randomly select one among the subgroup that already has some
predator with any of the existing prey of i. If there is no species
obeying these constraints, then j is selected.

Table I: List of empirical networks considered in this work. The ﬁrst column shows their names, the fourth their types, and the last one references
to the literature. The z-scores of intervalities ξ and η are computed with respect to a null model consisting in many randomisations of each network
which preserve both in- and out-degree sequences. The number of “stars” after each z-score indicates whether the z-score is between 1 and 2 (∗),
2 and 3 (∗∗), or larger than 3 (∗ ∗ ∗).
