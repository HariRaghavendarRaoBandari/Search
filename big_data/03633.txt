When exploring new materials for their poten-
tial in (opto)electronic device applications, it is
important to understand the role of various car-
rier interaction and scattering processes. Re-
search on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
semiconductors has recently progressed towards
the realisation of working devices, which involve
light-emitting diodes [1], nanocavity lasers [2],
and single-photon emitters [3, 4].
In these
two-dimensional atomically thin semiconductors,
the Coulomb interaction is known to be much
stronger than in quantum wells of conventional
semiconductors like GaAs, as witnessed by the
50 times larger exciton binding energy [5]. The
question arises, whether this directly translates
into equivalently faster carrier-carrier Coulomb
scattering of excited carriers. Here we show
that a combination of ab-initio band-structure
and many-body theory predicts carrier relaxation
on a 50-fs time scale, which is less than an or-
der of magnitude faster than in quantum wells.
These scattering times compete with the recently
reported sub-ps exciton recombination times [6],
thus making it harder to achieve population in-
version and lasing.

In the past, for conventional semiconductors, consid-
erable experimental and theoretical activities have been
devoted to identify and characterize the intrinsic inter-
action processes. Only on these grounds, it was possible
to reveal the true device operation potential of a mate-
rial. For the new TMD semiconductors, experiments un-
covering carrier relaxation processes in connection with
optical properties are at a very early stage. Among
the experiments are time-resolved diﬀerential transmis-
sion measurements demonstrating rapid thermalisation
and cooling of excited carriers [7], ultrafast diﬀeren-
tial reﬂection changes due to excited carriers [8], and
excitation-density and temperature dependent homoge-
neous linewidth studies [9]. While these experiments fo-
cus on below-band-gap excitation of excitons, the device-
relevant case of elevated carrier densities with large ex-
cess energy, exhibiting a diﬀerent relaxation dynamics,
has not been addressed yet.
In the present work, we
study the relaxation of optically excited carriers with
large excess energy under the inﬂuence of carrier-carrier
Coulomb interaction in a freestanding monolayer of MoS2
to quantify the material limits of carrier scattering rates.
The results are compared to carrier dynamics predicted
for quasi-resonant optical pumping of excitons. For

this purpose, we determine the evolution of the initial
nonequilibrium carrier distributions and their relaxation
across the whole Brillouin zone for the diﬀerent excita-
tion conditions, which are shown to strongly inﬂuence
the scattering eﬃciency. Within our approach, we are
able to address separately the dynamics of electrons and
holes that is governed by the characteristic valley struc-
tures of the respective bands. This type of investigations
critically depends on a realistic description of the band
structure and on the material-speciﬁc enhancement of
the Coulomb interaction. The latter needs to include
the particular quasi-two-dimensional nature of the atom-
ically thin material as well as the reduced dielectric back-
ground screening of the Coulomb interaction as discussed
in [10].
In our calculations, the role of these ground-
state properties is complemented by screening and many-
particle band structure renormalisations due to dynami-
cally changing distributions of excited carriers.

Carrier Dynamics After Femtosecond Pulse Excita-
tion.
In the following, we consider two diﬀerent exci-
tation scenarios that directly relate to most optical ex-
periments performed on TMD semiconductors. Quasi-
resonant excitation of the monolayer below the single-
particle band gap is facilitated by the existence of exci-
tonic states, which can be coherently driven by a resonant
optical pulse. Excitation above the single-particle band
gap by optical pulses with shorter wavelengths on the
other hand generates an electron-hole plasma. We show
that although both scenarios result in ultrafast carrier
dynamics throughout the Brillouin zone, the observed
time scales are diﬀerent. To this end, we solve the ki-
netic equations discussed in the Methods section, which
include optical transitions between and carrier dynamics
in the two highest valence bands and the two lowest con-
duction bands. The latter are highlighted in Fig. 1a. The
theory also includes the interband electron-hole Coulomb
interaction as well as the intraband electron-electron and
hole- hole interaction.

Optical excitation is described by a Gaussian laser
pulse with a temporal width of 50 fs, corresponding to
a spectral width of 73 meV, and applied perpendicular
to the freestanding layer assuming circular light polari-
sation. For the ﬁrst scenario of quasi-resonant excitation
the wavelength is chosen so that it partly overlaps with
the A-exciton resonance (detuning 60 meV above A ex-
citon), while above-band-gap excitation takes place 600
meV above the single-particle gap (corresponding to a
405 nm wavelength). The homogeneous linewidth of the
optical transition is described in Eq. (1) by a phenomeno-

about 10 ps, K, K’ and Σ valley populations of electrons
are almost equal, while the Σ’ valley is less populated
due to its separation by spin-orbit splitting.

The time evolution of the electron and hole distribution
over the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone is shown
in Fig. 1c and d for quasi-resonant and above-band-gap
excitation, respectively. In the case of quasi-resonant ex-
citation, the coherent optical ﬁeld creates a polarisation
in the system due to its spectral overlap with the exci-
tonic resonance. The result is a population of carriers
at the respective k-points where the bound-state wave
functions reside. For the A exciton, this is mainly in the
K valleys of the Brillouin zone [10–12], as can be seen
in Fig. 1c at time 0.1 ps. Subsequently, carrier popula-
tions are distributed among the diﬀerent valleys in the
band structure on a ps time scale, as depicted in Fig. 2a.
Electrons are ﬁrst drawn from the K to the Σ valley and
later also to Σ’ and K’, which are far oﬀ in k-space. After

The main feature observed in the hole distribution is a
narrowing as it approaches a Fermi distribution function,
whereas only a small fraction of holes is lost to K’ and Γ.
The energy separation between K and K’ valleys, which is
determined by the spin-orbit interaction, is large enough
to prevent eﬃcient inter-valley transfer of holes. As a
result of this energy barrier, even the fast carrier-carrier
Coulomb scattering (which itself conserves the spin) can
redistribute only a small fraction of holes with a given
spin polarisation between K and K’ valleys. This and
the fact that spin-ﬂip processes occur on a much longer ns
time scale is what enables spintronics applications based
on monolayer TMDs [13, 14].

By exciting the monolayer 600 meV above the single-
particle gap, an electron-hole plasma is created in those

k-states overlapping energetically with the optical pulse
according to the momentum-dependent dipole coupling.
This leads to an excess energy of carriers corresponding
to a temperature of about 10000 K. The resulting car-
rier distribution in the Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 1d
after 75 fs, when the optical pulse has reached its peak
value. We ﬁnd that already 50 fs later, electrons and
holes have relaxed to their corresponding valleys in the
band structure, see also Fig. 2b, which shows that car-
rier relaxation takes place on the same time scale as the
ultrashort optical pulse.
In graphene as another two-
dimensional material, longer relaxation times of about
100 fs have been found [15]. One reason for this dif-
ference is the orientational preference of carrier scatter-
ing in graphene that strongly favors co-linear scattering,
which does not exist in TMDs. After the ultrafast ini-
tial relaxation, carriers redistribute slightly among the
valleys as electrons and holes equilibrate to a common
temperature. This process is determined by the slower
dynamics of the hole relaxation. The same tendency was
found in [7] for few-layer MoS2. The origin for carrier re-
laxation from high-energy states being faster than inter-
valley scattering is the better availability of ﬁnal states
for the assisting scattering process. Additionally, inter-
valley scattering requires larger momentum transfer, for
which the involved Coulomb matrix elements are smaller.
In comparison, both excitation schemes lead to qualita-
tively diﬀerent carrier distributions in the Brillouin zone:
By exciting above the gap, a hot electron-hole plasma in
the band structure valleys is created on a sub-100 fs time
scale, while quasi-resonant excitation below the gap leads
to a strong electron and hole population in the K valley
and carriers are lost to other valleys only on a slower time
scale of several ps.

The ﬁnal quasi-equilibrium carrier distribution de-
pends on the relative energetic positions of the valleys
in each band. When considering energy renormalisations
of the band structure due to many-body interaction of ex-
cited carriers, we ﬁnd that the valleys exhibit diﬀerent en-
ergy shifts. The corresponding results are provided in the
Supplementary Material. Similar to modiﬁcations of the
band structure by strain [16, 17], the excitation-induced
shifts after quasi-resonant excitation mediate a transition
from direct to indirect semiconductor during the inter-
valley scattering. Moreover, the renormalisations cause
a band-gap shrinkage of about 200 meV for the excitation
parameters used here. Another eﬀect that is important
for the carrier dynamics besides many-particle renormal-
isations is the screening of Coulomb interaction due to
excited carriers, which strongly depends on the carrier
distribution in k-space and hence on the excitation sce-
nario. As shown in the Supplementary Material, this
aﬀects the carrier-carrier scattering eﬃciency and is a
strong contribution to the observed diﬀerent time scales
for the relaxation dynamics.

In conclusion, we have studied the excited-carrier dy-

3

namics due to carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering in TMD
semiconductor systems on the basis of a material-realistic
ab-initio description of the electronic band structure and
Coulomb interaction in combination with a many-body
theory of carrier dynamics. The eﬃciency of carrier re-
distribution throughout the Brillouin zone is shown to be
determined by an interplay of carrier scattering and time-
dependent many-particle renormalisations of the band
structure as well as screening of the Coulomb interac-
tion. As a result, thermalisation on a 50 fs timescale
following above-band-gap excitation is possible due to
eﬃcient carrier-carrier scattering in the two-dimensional
material. We report signiﬁcantly slower relaxation on
a 5 ps timescale for quasi-resonant excitation below the
band gap. In this case, carriers are mainly generated in
the K valleys, from where further redistribution requires
inter-valley scattering with a large momentum transfer.
In conventional semiconductors based on GaAs, carrier-
carrier scattering leads to a redistribution of excited car-
riers towards Fermi-Dirac-functions on a timescale of 100
fs.
[18–20] Having the huge exciton binding energy in
two-dimensional TMDs in mind, the carrier scattering
eﬃciency in these materials appears to be smaller than
expected. A comparison to recently reported exciton re-
combination times of 150 fs [6] leads us to the conclusion
that the ratio of both time scales is less favourable for
achieving population inversion and laser operation than
in conventional semiconductors.

Methods. We

combine material-realistic ab-initio
methods with a many-body theory of the carrier dynam-
ics. Band structures and Coulomb matrix elements from
a G0W0 calculation are used as a basis for excited-carrier

Eq. (1) together with Eq. (4) represent a two-particle
Schr¨odinger equation for the relative motion of optically

interband transitions, described by ψk, represent pair ex-
citations under the inﬂuence of Coulomb interaction, so
that Eq (4) contains transitions of both excitonic bound
and scattering states. The corresponding population of
excited carriers in connection with the optical excitation

On the level of a Boltzmann equation [21], dynam-

servation are formulated with energies (cid:101)εk(t) given by

the ground-state G0W0 band structure, which is renor-
malised by time-dependent Hartree-Fock shifts induced

nonequilibrium Green’s functions, this is the result of a
quasi-particle approximation, which is introduced in the
spirit of perturbation theory. Furthermore, the scatter-
ing rates contain statically screened Coulomb matrix el-
ements. The nonequilibrium Green’s functions technique
naturally includes the screening of the interaction as part
of the diagram summation leading to the second-order

Carrier Spins.

Due to the mirror symmetry of monolayer transi-
tion metal dichalcogenides with respect to the x-y plane
(where z is the growth direction), each electronic band
has a well-deﬁned z component of spin, even in the pres-
ence of spin-orbit interaction. The latter causes a sig-
niﬁcant splitting of bands, especially at the K point of
the valence band and at the Σ point of the conduction
band.
[22] There are no optical selection rules with re-
spect to carrier spin but only to the valley degree of free-
dom. Hence circularly polarized light excites electrons
and holes in both spin directions.

For the discussion of results in the main text we restrict
ourselves to the time evolution of carriers with positive
z-direction of spin, corresponding to the A-exciton res-
onance, as results are similar for the other spin polari-
sation. Modiﬁcations stem from the diﬀerent energetic
position of the B-exciton resonance and the spin-down
band structure relative to the optical pulse energy. Note
that although carrier-carrier-Coulomb interaction is not
able to ﬂip carrier spins, excited carriers in diﬀerent spin-
subsystems inﬂuence each other signiﬁcantly via the elec-
trostatic Hartree interaction, by taking up excess energy

5

in carrier-carrier-scattering processes and by contribut-
ing to the screening of Coulomb interaction.

Hartree-Fock Renormalisations.

In Fig. 3, we provide results for the time-dependent
band structure renormalisations due to Hartree-Fock in-
teraction, caused by the excited carriers, which enter the
carrier-scattering rates in Eq. (5). For the quasi-resonant
excitation scenario presented in Fig. 3a, we ﬁnd that both
electron and hole K valleys are signiﬁcantly lowered dur-
ing the excitation pulse by exchange interaction. The
lowering of hole energies in the K valley proceeds dur-
ing carrier relaxation, as a Fermi distribution forms in
the dynamically renormalized band structure until self-
consistence of energies and populations is reached. This
leads to a single-particle-gap shrinkage of about 200 meV
and a reduced eﬀective mass of the valence band K valley.
On the other hand, the exchange shift of electrons in the
K valley is reduced during inter-valley scattering, as elec-
trons are lost to the Σ valley. The K’-valley energies of
electrons and holes as well as the Γ-valley energy are ini-
tially shifted due to Hartree interaction with the carriers
in the K valleys. At later stages of the time evolution,
these shifts are reduced, as carriers redistribute among
the valleys. The Σ valley experiences an almost constant
red shift due to Hartree and exchange interaction, which
is in equilibrium situation (reached at later times) larger
than the K-valley shift. In combination with the ground-
state band structure, the net result is a shift of the Σ
valley below K. Thus the many-particle renormalisations
cause a transformation from direct to indirect semicon-
ductor.

For above-band-gap excitation, dynamical Hartree-
Fock shifts of the band-structure valleys are shown in
Fig. 3b. As carriers are not generated in the valleys but
in the center of the Brillouin zone, the initially induced
renormalisations in the valleys are small. During car-
rier relaxation, they become larger, but remain in the
meV region due to the much broader population func-
tions compared to quasi-resonant excitation.

Excited-carrier Screening.

in TMD systems, which is caused by excited carriers, by a

The ground-state band structure is used in the denom-
inator. For numerical stability a small phenomenological
damping γ = 10−2 meV and a small residual electron
and hole density of 109 cm−2 is assumed to populate
the system before the optical excitation to enable ﬁnite
screening at all times.

In Fig. 4, we show the scaled inverse dielectric func-
tion at diﬀerent times (corresponding to Fig.1 in the
main text) for above-gap and quasi-resonant optical ex-

citation as discussed in the main text. We ﬁnd that for
above-gap excitation, screening is relatively weak at early
times, as carrier populations are generated in k-space far
from the band-structure valleys. This behaviour is char-
acteristic for two-dimensional systems and can already
be estimated in the long-wavelength (small q) limit in
an eﬀective-mass model, where screening is only caused
by the carrier population in the valleys.

ers are scattered into the valleys the screening eﬃciency

Inﬂuence of Phonons.

In the present work we only consider carrier dynamics
due to carrier-carrier scattering and neglect the eﬀects
of phonons on carrier-scattering times and carrier tem-
perature.
In the early stage of the relaxation dynam-
ics, this assumption is supported by the fact that the
monolayer phonons will be heated themselves by the in-
teraction with the excited carriers, which reduces their
carrier-scattering and cooling eﬃciency. On a typical
time scale of 1 ps [7], the monolayer phonons, and with
them the carriers, are expected to thermalize to the am-
bient temperature due to interaction with the substrate.
For above-band-gap excitation, this is expected not to
interfere with the faster dynamics due to carrier-carrier
scattering discussed here. On the other hand, in few-layer
MoS2 carrier-phonon interaction has been identiﬁed as a
source for eﬃcient inter-valley scattering on the sub-ps
time scale.
In [24], this is found to be the most eﬃ-
cient mechanism for inter-valley scattering. The result
is consistent with our ﬁndings of carrier-carrier-mediated
inter-valley scattering taking place on a longer time scale
and hence being the less important mechanism here. In
the end, the role of phonons will be much more depen-
dent on the external heat management of the TMD layers
in comparison to conventional semiconductors.

Numerical Methods.

The ab-initio calculations are performed as described
in detail in [10]. The Brillouin-zone integral in Eq. (7)
is evaluated by means of adaptive cubature over a tri-
angular region using the DCUTRI algorithm.
[25] For
this purpose, the population functions and band struc-
ture under the k-integral are interpolated with a cubic
Shepard method. [26]

The equations of motion (1) and (2) in combination
with equations (3) to (6) are integrated in time using
an adaptive predictor-corrector method.
[27] We use a
Monkhorst-Pack grid to sample the Brillouin zone. We
ﬁnd that in the case of quasi-resonant optical excitation,
48x48x1 grid points are suﬃcient to converge the carrier-
carrier scattering results, while in the case of above-gap
excitation, the carrier distribution in k-space generated
by the optical pulse is better resolved by a 60x60x1-grid.
Due to symmetry, the equations of motion have to be
solved for states k from the irreducible Brillouin zone
only, while summation over k(cid:48) and q describing interac-
tion processes has to run over the full Brillouin zone.

To evaluate the energy-conserving Dirac-Delta func-
tions in the carrier-carrier scattering integrals (Eq. (5)),
we successively replace the Delta functions by appropri-

ately normalised Gaussians with decreasing width and
using a Romberg extrapolation to obtain the scattering
integrals in the limit of zero width.
