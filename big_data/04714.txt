Abstract. Asymptotic reductions of a defocusing nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger
model in (3+1)-dimensions, in both Cartesian and cylindrical geometry, are presented.
First, at an intermediate stage, a Boussinesq equation is derived, and then its far-ﬁeld,
in the form of a variety of Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations for right- and left-
going waves, is found. KP models include versions of the KP-I and KP-II equations,
in Cartesian and cylindrical geometry. Solitary waves solutions, planar or ring-shaped,
and of dark or anti-dark type, are also predicted to occur. Their nature and stability is
determined by a parameter deﬁned by the physical parameters of the original nonlocal
system.
It is thus found that (dark) anti-dark solitary waves are only supported
by a weak (strong) nonlocality, and are unstable (stable) in higher-dimensions. Our
analytical predictions are corroborated by direct numerical simulations.

1. Introduction

In the theory of nonlinear waves, many problems appear where several diﬀerent temporal
and/or spatial scales are present. Thus, asymptotic multiscale expansion methods are
usually applied to derive nonlinear evolution equations more manageable to the problem
at hand [1]. By means of such asymptotic methods, it has been demonstrated that
several systems integrable by the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) [2] can be reduced
to other integrable models [3]. Such connections have been proved extremely useful
since solutions of the reduced models can be used to construct approximate solutions of
the original models. A prominent example is the connection of the defocusing nonlinear
Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which allowed
for the description of shallow dark solitons of the former in terms of KdV solitons.
Relevant studies started in the early 70s [4] and continue to this date [5]; importantly,
they have also been extended to the case of non-integrable systems, providing extremely

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

useful information on the existence, stability and dynamics of solutions in various
physical settings, such as nonlinear optics [6] and Bose-Einstein condensates [7, 8].

Importantly, nonlocality plays a key role on the soliton properties.

Indeed, these methods become even more useful when the original system is not
integrable without known solutions in explicit form. Models featuring a spatially
nonlocal nonlinear response are important examples, since they are used to describe
beam dynamics and solitons in various systems such as plasmas [9], atomic vapors [10],
lead glasses featuring strong thermal nonlinearity [11], as well as media with a long-
range inter-particle interaction. The latter include nematic liquid crystals with long-
range molecular reorientational interactions [12], as well as dipolar bosonic quantum
gases [13].
In
particular, in the case of focusing nonlocal nonlinearities, collapse does not take place in
higher-dimensions [14, 15], which results in stable solitons, as observed in experiments
of, say [10,11], even in the (3+1)-dimensional setting [16] – see, e.g., reviews [15,17] and
references therein. On the other hand, in the case of defocusing nonlocal nonlinearities,
dark solitons that are supported in such settings [18–21], may exhibit an attractive
interaction [18], rather than a repulsive one, as is the situation in the case of a local
nonlinearity – cf. [6–8] and references therein. Furthermore, dark solitons which are
known to be prone to the transverse (or “snaking”) instability in higher-dimensional
settings [8, 22–24], can be stabilized due to the nonlocal nonlinearity [25].

Motivated by the above, and particularly by the fact that nonlocal nonlinearities
have a profound eﬀect on the form and stability properties of nonlinear excitations, in
this work, we study a nonlocal defocusing NLS model in (3 + 1)-dimensions. A brief
description of our ﬁndings, as well as the outline of the presentation, is as follows.

First, in Section 2, we present the model which is considered in both physically
relevant geometries: Cartesian and cylindrical. The model describes light beam
propagation in nematic liquid crystals [26,27] and thermal nonlinear media [15], and has
been used to predict three-dimensional (3D) solitons [16,17]. In addition, the continuous-
wave (cw) solution is found and its stability is analysed. Then, in Section 3, we use
multiscale expansion methods to derive asymptotic reductions of the nonlocal NLS
equation. At an intermediate stage of the asymptotic analysis, we obtain a Boussinesq-
type equation. Next, we consider the far-ﬁeld of the Boussinesq equation, and derive
various Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) type models for right- and left-going waves. These
models, which are classiﬁed in Section 4, include KP-I and KP-II equations, in Cartesian
and cylindrical geometry (in the latter, the relevant model is also known as the Johnson
equation [28]), as well as the Cylindrical-I (CI) and Cylindrical-II (CII) equations. All
these models have been used to describe various physical situations ranging from shallow-
water waves to ion-acoustic waves in plasmas, and so on [29–32]. In the same Section
(Sec. 4), we present solitary waves of the original nonlocal model, which are constructed
from solutions of the eﬀective asymptotic equations. We thus ﬁnd KdV-type, spatial
dark or anti-dark solitary waves, namely intensity dips or humps on top of the cw-
background, which may exhibit either a planar shape (stripes) or a cylindrical (ring)
shape. Dark (anti-dark) solitary waves exist in a weak (strong) nonlocal regime, deﬁned

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

by the sign of a characteristic quantity that links all the physical parameters of the
original nonlocal system, and are unstable (stable) in the 2D setting. We also ﬁnd
temporal dark solitary waves which are predicted to be unstable in higher-dimensions.
Our analytical predictions are found to be in very good agreement with results from
direct numerical simulations:
indeed, using the analytical forms of the spatial soliton
solutions as initial conditions for the direct numerical integration of the original problem,
we ﬁnd that the solitons propagate undistorted – at least for relatively small propagation
distances. Note that, even for longer propagation distances, instabilities are not observed
in our simulations, which suggests that the solitons found have a good chance to be
observed in experiments. Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions and highlight
some interesting directions for future studies.

2. Model and continuous wave solution

We consider a (3 + 1)-dimensional nonlocal NLS model, composed by a system of two
coupled equations for the complex ﬁeld amplitude u and the nonlinear correction to
the refractive index n (which is a real function). This model applies, in particular, to
light propagation in nematic liquid crystals [12, 26] and to thermal nonlinear optical
media [15] (see also relevant theoretical and experimental work in [33]). The system
under consideration is expressed in the following dimensionless form [16, 17]:

1
2

(∆u − Dutt) − 2nu = 0,

iuz +
d∆n − 2qn + 2|u|2 = 0,

(1)

(2)

where subscripts denote partial derivatives, z is the propagation coordinate (normalized
to the diﬀraction length), t is retarded time, and ∆ is the transverse Laplacian. Below,
we consider both physically relevant geometries, Cartesian and cylindrical, for which
the Laplacian respectively reads:

∆ = ∂2

x + ∂2
y ,

∆ =

1
r

∂r(r∂r) +

1
r2 ∂2
θ ,

with transverse coordinates r⊥ = (x, y) or r⊥ = (r, θ), respectively, normalized
with respect to the beam width. Additionally, the real constants D, d, and q in
Eqs. (1)-(2), which are assumed to be O(1) parameters in our analysis below, have the
following physical signiﬁcance. First, D represents the ratio of diﬀraction and dispersion
lengths, with D > 0 (D < 0) corresponding to anomalous (normal) group-velocity
dispersion (GVD). Second, in the context of nematic liquid crystals, the parameter q
is related to the square of the applied static electric ﬁeld that pre-tilts the nematic
dielectric [27, 34, 35]. Third, parameter d measures the relative width of the response of
the medium to the light ﬁeld, and is connected to the nonlocality scale of the nonlinear
response of the medium: in the limit d → 0, the system of Eqs. (1)-(2) decouples and is
reduced to a local (3+1)-dimensional NLS equation with a cubic defocusing nonlinearity.

To start our analysis, we use the Madelung transformation

u = u0

ρ exp(iφ),

(3)

(u0 being an arbitrary complex constant) to separate the real functions for the amplitude
ρ and phase φ of u in Eq. (1), and derive from Eqs. (1)-(2) the following system:

It is readily observed that the above system possesses an exact steady-state solution

of the form:

of Eqs. (1)-(2). Note that the constant amplitude u0 can be absorbed into ρ in the
Madelung transformation; nevertheless, for convenience, we opt to use u0 in Eq. (3) so
that no extra free phase appears on the solutions that we present below, thus making
presentation more clear. To further elaborate on this point, and also to underline the
importance of this cw solution in our analysis (because the cw deﬁnes the background
on top of which our solutions will propagate), let us write the solution of Eqs. (1)-(2) as

u = U0(z)¯u, n = n0¯n,

where the background (cw) solution satisﬁes

i

dz

= 2n0U0, n0 =

.

Obviously, the solution of the above equations is given in Eq. (7), while ¯u and ¯n satisfy

This system possesses a cw solution of unit amplitude, as would be the case if u0 was
not used in the Madelung transformation (i.e., in other words, u0 will inevitably appear
in the cw background solution).

Below we seek nonlinear excitations (e.g., solitary waves) which propagate on top
It is, thus, relevant to investigate if this solution is subject

can be investigated upon employing Eqs. (4)-(6) as follows. Let
|u0|2 + ˜n,

|u0|2z + ˜φ, n =

ρ = 1 + ˜ρ, φ = −2
q

1
q

where small perturbations ˜ρ, ˜φ and ˜n are assumed to behave like exp[i(kzz+k⊥·r⊥−ωt)].
Here, we should recall that the evolution variable in our problem is the propagation
distance z and, thus, the MI analysis is performed with respect to this variable; as such,
kz and its roots (real or imaginary) will determine the stability of the cw solution. To
this end, substituting the above ansatz into Eqs. (4)-(6), we ﬁnd that small-amplitude
linear waves obey a dispersion relation of the following form,

(8)

The results stemming from the above equation are as follows. First, Eq. (8) shows that
the cw solution is always modulationally stable, i.e., kz ∈ R ∀ k⊥, ω, provided D < 0.
Note, that in the (1+1)-dimensional case (corresponding to ky = 0 and D = 0, or k⊥ = 0
and D = −1), this result recovers the one of Ref. [15]. Second, if D = |D| > 0, the cw
solution is unstable: in this case, perturbations grow exponentially, with the instability
growth rate given by Im(kz). Thus, hereafter, we focus on this case, and assume that
D = −|D|, corresponding to the anomalous GVD regime. It is, therefore, clear that
the asymptotic analysis and results that we present in the following Sections are only
valid in this regime; in the opposite case, of D = |D| > 0, since the cw background is
unstable, any small perturbations on top of it will result in collapsing solutions.

Another physically relevant information stemming from Eq. (8) is that, in the long-
wavelength and low-frequency limit (i.e., |k⊥|, ω → 0), small-amplitude spatial or
temporal waves propagate on top of the cw background with “sound velocities” C 2 or
V 2, respectively, which are given by:

C 2 =

2|u0|2

q

,

V 2 = C 2|D|.

(9)

These characteristic velocities can also be determined, in a self-consistent manner, in the
framework of the reductive perturbation method (see, e.g., Ref. [36]). It is also noted
that in the unstable case of D = |D| > 0, velocity V becomes imaginary, a fact that also
indicates that perturbations of the cw solution grow exponentially in the propagation
distance z.

3. Eﬀective nonlinear evolution equations

3.1. The Boussinesq equation

Observing that the dispersion relation (8) resembles the one of a Boussinesq equation
[31, 32], we now derive from Eqs. (4)-(6) a Boussinesq equation, for either Cartesian or

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

6

ρ = 1 + ερ1 + ε2ρ2 + ··· , n =

cylindrical geometry. We thus seek solutions of Eqs. (4)-(6) in the form of the following
asymptotic expansions:
|u0|2 + εn1 + ε2n2 + ··· , (10)
|u0|2z + ε1/2Φ,
φ = −2
q
where ε is a formal small parameter (0 < ε (cid:28) 1), while unknown real functions Φ,
ρj and nj are assumed to depend on “slow variables”. In particular, for the Cartesian
geometry, Φ, ρj and nj are taken to depend on {Z, X, Y, T}, while, for the cylindrical
geometry, on {Z, R, θ, T} (the angular coordinate θ is assumed to remain unchanged);
these slow variables are deﬁned as:

1
q

Z = ε1/2z, X = ε1/2x,

Y = ε1/2y, R = ε1/2r, T = ε1/2t.

(11)

Substituting the expansions (10) into Eqs. (4)-(6), and using the variables in Eq. (11),
we obtain the following results. First, Eq. (4) reads:

˜∇ =

for the cylindrical case. Second, Eq. (5) leads, at orders O(ε3/2) and O(ε5/2), to the
following equations, respectively:

ρ1Z + ˜∆Φ + |D|ΦT T = 0,
ρ2Z + ˜∇ · (ρ1

˜∇Φ) + |D|(ρ1ΦT )T = 0.

Finally, Eq. (6), at orders O(ε) and O(ε2), lead, respectively, to the equations:

− 2qn1 + 2|u0|2ρ1 = 0,
d ˜∆n1 − 2qn2 + 2|u0|2ρ2 = 0.

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

The leading-order part of Eq. (12), together with Eq. (15), provides the following
connection between functions Φ, n1 and ρ1:

ΦZ = −2n1 = −C 2ρ1.

Furthermore, from the system of Eqs. (12)-(16), it is possible to eliminate functions ρ1,2
and n1,2, and derive the following equation for Φ:

It is clear that, to leading-order, Eq. (18) is a linear wave equation indicating
that the velocities of spatial or temporal waves are indeed those given in Eq. (9).
In addition, at order O(ε), Eq. (18) incorporates fourth-order dispersion terms and
quadratic nonlinear terms. Obviously, Eq. (18) is a Boussinesq-type equation, either
in Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates, as per the discussion above. The Boussinesq
equation has been originally proposed for studies of waves in shallow water [29, 31, 32],
but later it was also used in diﬀerent contexts, ranging from ion-acoustic waves in
plasmas [29, 30] to mechanical lattices and electrical transmission lines [37].

A Boussinesq equation, similar to that in Eq. (18), was derived from a (2 + 1)-
dimensional NLS equation, in Cartesian coordinates, with a local defocusing nonlinearity
[23]; earlier analysis of this Boussinesq model [38] was used in [23] to investigate self-
focusing and transverse instability of plane dark solitons (see also [24] for a review
and references therein). In fact, the Cartesian version of the Boussinesq model (18) is
reduced to the one derived in [23] in the limit of d → 0, i.e., in the local nonlinearity
case.

3.2. Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli-type equations

We now proceed to derive the far-ﬁeld equations stemming from the Boussinesq model
(18), in the framework of multiscale asymptotic expansions. As is known, the far-ﬁeld of
the Boussinesq equation in (1 + 1)-dimensions is a pair of two KdV equations [32], while
in (2 + 1)-dimensions, it is a pair of KP equations [23], for right- and left-going waves.
Below we show that Eq. (18) gives rise to (3 + 1)-dimensional KP-type models for such
waves.
In addition, we will distinguish cases corresponding to two diﬀerent types of
solitary waves that may be supported either in Cartesian or cylindrical geometry: one,
is oblique tube-shaped, oriented under a uniquely determined angle to the propagation
axis, i.e., a spatial solitary wave; the other, is a constant-shape localized perturbation
propagating along the z-axis, i.e., a temporal solitary wave.

3.2.1. Spatial solitary waves First, we consider spatial solitary waves, which may have
either the form of stripes propagating on the XZ plane (Cartesian geometry), or exhibit
an annular shape, with the ring radius varying with the propagation distance (cylindrical
geometry). We thus introduce the variables:

χ = X − CZ,

˜χ = X + CZ, Z = εZ, Y = ε1/2Y,

T = ε1/2T,

and

 = R − CZ,

˜ = R + CZ, Z = εZ, Θ = ε−1/2θ,

T = ε1/2T,

for the two geometries, respectively. We also look for solutions of Eq. (18) in the form
of the asymptotic expansion:

Φ = Φ0 + εΦ1 + ··· .

(20)

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

Substituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (18), we obtain the following results. At leading-order,
O(1):

4C 2Φ0χ ˜χ = 0,

4C 2Φ0˜ = 0,

(21)

for the Cartesian and cylindrical geometry, respectively. The above equations imply
that, in each case, Φ0 can be expressed as a superposition of a right-going wave, Φ(R)
,
depending on χ or , and a left-going one, Φ(L)

, depending on ˜χ or ˜, namely:

is obvious that the terms in square brackets in the right-hand side are secular, because
are functions of χ or ˜χ (of  or ˜) alone. Removal of these terms leads to two uncoupled
nonlinear evolution equations for Φ(R)

3.2.2. Temporal solitary waves We now proceed with the case of temporal solitary
waves. First, introduce the variables:

τ = T − V Z,

˜τ = T + V Z, Z = εZ,

as well as

X = ε1/2X, Y = ε1/2Y,

and R = ε1/2R, Θ = ε−1/2θ,

for the Cartesian and cylindrical geometry, respectively. Then, in each case, utilizing
the above variables and the asymptotic expansion (20), we obtain from Eq. (18) the
leading-order equation:

4V 2Φ0τ ˜τ = 0,

which yields again Eq. (22). Furthermore, working as in the previous case, we obtain
at order O(ε):

We conclude this section with the observation that all equations that were derived
for ρ(R,L)
are of the KP type, in both geometries. Below we elaborate more on these
eﬀective models, and focus on limiting cases corresponding to their lower-dimensional

versions. For simplicity, we only consider the right-going waves, ρ(R)
(−Z). In addition, we will present examples of solitary wave solutions of Eqs. (1)-(2)

In the above equations, parameter σ2 is given by

and it is reminded that α is given by Eq. (19).

The (1 + 1)-dimensional versions of Eqs. (34) and (35), i.e., the ones referring to the
Zχ and Z plane, have respectively the form of a KdV and a cylindrical KdV (cKdV)
equation. Both models are completely integrable by means of the IST [2], and ﬁnd
numerous applications in a variety of physical contexts [30–32,37]. The KdV and cKdV
equations have been derived by means of multiscale expansion methods from local NLS
models, with the aim to describe shallow planar dark solitons in Bose gases [4] and
ring dark solitons in nonlinear optical media [39] (see also reviews [6, 7] and references
therein). More recently, a KdV equation was derived from the (1 + 1)-dimensional
version of Eqs. (1)-(2) for D = 0, and used to describe small-amplitude nematicons [21];
in fact, the KdV model derived in [21] is identical with the (1 + 1)-dimensional version
of Eq. (25) [or (34)].

Furthermore, there are two distinct (2 + 1)-dimensional versions of Eq. (34): a
spatial one, in the ZχY space, and a spatio-temporal one, in the ZχT space. These
eﬀective models can be used to describe either spatial optical solitons in nematic liquid
crystals [26], or dispersion-induced dynamics of spatial solitons in thermal media [15].
Both these (2 + 1)-dimensional equations, are completely integrable by means of the
IST [2].

Importantly, the (2 + 1)-dimensional versions, as well as the complete Eq. (34),
include both versions of the KP equation, KP-I and KP-II [2]. Indeed, for σ = 1, i.e.,

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations
11
α < 0 ⇒ d > (q/2|u0|)2, Eq. (34) is a KP-II equation; on the other hand, for σ = i, i.e.,
α > 0 ⇒ d < (q/2|u0|)2, Eq. (34) is a KP-I equation. Recalling that d is the degree of
nonlocality of the system at hand (for d → 0 nonlocal NLS Eqs. (1)-(2) become local),
it is evident that relatively weak (strong) nonlocality, as deﬁned by the above regimes
of d, corresponds to a KP-I (KP-II) model. This fact has also important implications
on the type and the stability of low-dimensional solitary waves that can be supported
in the system (see below).

Similarly, we observe that there are two distinct (2 + 1)-dimensional versions of
Eq. (35): a spatial one, in the ZΘ space, and a spatio-temporal one, in the ZT
space, which ﬁnd applications in the contexts discussed above in the Cartesian case. The
spatial version of Eq. (35) is a cylindrical KP (cKP) equation, which is also known as
the Johnson’s equation [28], and describes nearly-concentric solitons in an ideal, inviscid
ﬂuid [31]. This model is, also, completely integrable by means of the IST [40]. On the
other hand, in the ZT space, Eq. (27) reduces to the so-called CI equation, which
describes weak cylindrical ion-acoustic solitons in plasmas [30]. Unlike the Johnson’s
equation, the CI equation is not considered to be integrable, as it fails to pass the
Painlev´e test [2].

It is interesting to point out that there exist transformations mapping solutions of

the KP and cKP equations [31]. Indeed, the map:
U (Z, χ, Y) → W (Z, , Θ) := U

transforms any solution of the KP equation (34) into a solution of the cKP equation (35);
conversely, the map:

W (Z, χ, Θ) → U (Z, χ, Y) := W

transforms any solution of the cKP equation (35) into a solution of the KP equation (34).
Here, we should also note that the spatial (2 + 1)-dimensional versions of KP Eq. (34)
and cKP Eq. (35) are also connected with another relevant model, the elliptic cKP
(ecKP), that was recently presented and studied in [41]. In this work, it was shown
that the ecKP model describes surface gravity waves of nearly elliptic fronts, and it is
completely integrable. Based on the similarities of the hydrodynamic form (4)-(6) of
the nonlocal NLS Eqs. (1)-(2) to the problem formulation of [41], we conjecture that,
adopting an elliptic cylindrical coordinate system and following the lines of the analysis
presented here, one could derive a (3 + 1)-dimensional version of the ecKP equation.
Nevertheless, such a derivation is beyond the scope of the present work.

We now turn our attention to the KP models that describe temporal waves.
As before, ﬁrst we put Eqs. (31) in the “standard” form. We thus introduce the
transformations:

and obtain from Eqs. (31) the models:

(QZ + 6QQτ + Qτ τ τ )τ − 3 ˆ∆Q = 0,

(37)
and it is reminded that the Laplacian ˆ∆ refers to either the Cartesian or the cylindrical
geometry. Obviously, the (1 + 1)-dimensional version of Eq. (37) is the KdV equation.
On the other hand, it is observed that, unlike the case of spatial solitary waves, the
Cartesian version of Eq. (37) is solely of the KP-I type; in fact, in this case, transverse
eﬀects are not governed by the sign of parameter α. The (2 + 1)-dimensional version
of Eq. (37) is completely integrable by means of the IST [2]. Finally, the cylindrical
version of Eq. (37) is known as the CII equation, and describes cylindrical ion-acoustic
solitons in plasmas [30].

4.2. Solitary wave solutions

The asymptotic reduction of the nonlocal NLS equations to the eﬀective equations
above, allows for the derivation of approximate solutions of Eqs. (1)-(2), valid up to –
and including – order O(ε). Of particular interest are solitary wave solutions, which can
be constructed from solutions of Eqs. (34), (35) and (37). These asymptotic reductions
provide information on the type of the solitary wave, as well as on the stability of
lower-dimensional solutions in higher-dimensional settings. Below, we showcase some
characteristic examples along those lines.

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of spatial solitary waves. The (1 + 1)-dimensional
version of Eq. (34) is a KdV equation which possesses the commonly known soliton
solution:

U = 2κ2sech2[κ(χ − 4κ2Z − χ0)],

(38)

where κ and χ0 are constants. Using this solution, and reverting transformations for the
independent variables and ﬁelds, we ﬁnd the following approximate solution to Eqs. (1)-
(2):

The solution for u has the form of either a density dip (for α > 0) or a density hump
(for α < 0) on top of the cw background, with a tanh-shaped phase jump across the
density minimum or maximum, respectively. It is thus either a dark soliton (for α > 0)
or an anti-dark soliton (for α < 0); note that the soliton velocity υs is slightly below the
speed of sound, as is the case of shallow dark solitons in local media [6, 7]. Note that
if d → 0, then α > 0, which means that in the case of the local system the soliton is
always dark. In other words, anti-dark solitons are only supported due to the presence
of nonlocality, in accordance with the analysis of [21].

Figure 1. (Color Online) Typical dark (left) and anti-dark soliton (right) proﬁles, at
z = 0, in Cartesian geometry, for q = 1 and q = 5, respectively. All other parameter
values are equal to unity.

In Fig. 1, we depict the soliton solutions in Cartesian geometry according to
Eq. (38). Here, solutions’ proﬁles are plotted at z = 0; all parameter values are kept
equal to unity, and we vary parameter q so that to obtain a dark and an anti-dark
soliton, for q = 1 and q = 5, respectively. Furthermore, we use these proﬁles as initial
conditions, and perform a direct numerical integration of Eqs. (1)-(2) to determine
their evolution. For the simulations, we used a high accuracy spectral integrator in
Cartesian coordinates. The results are shown in the contour plots of Fig. 2, where it
is veriﬁed that these solutions maintain their stability – at least for relatively short
propagation distances (see discussion below) – and propagating characteristics. Notice
that, as expected from the analysis, the anti-dark soliton propagates at higher, though
constant, velocity from its dark soliton counterpart.

The fact that Eq. (34) is either a KP-I (for α < 0) or a KP-II (for α > 0) equation,
can be used to deduce stability of the approximate solitons in (2+1)-dimensions. Indeed,
as is well known [2], line soliton solutions of KP-I are unstable, while those of KP-II are
stable. This leads to the prediction that, in the context of the original problem, dark
soliton stripes of the nonlocal problem will be unstable in the 2D setting, while anti-dark
soliton stripes will be stable. Note that the instability in the context of the KP-I model
was analyzed [38] and connected to the context of self-focusing and transverse instability
of plane dark solitons in media with local defocusing nonlinearity [22, 23] (see also [24]
for a review and references therein). It should also be mentioned that in the case of
KP-I (for α < 0), there exist “lump” solitons which are stable in the 2D setting [2];
these structures can be used to construct approximate solutions of the original problem
which, in our case, will be 2D dark solitary waves, featuring an algebraic decay. These
“lump” solitons, however (along with the planar ones discussed above), are unstable in
the full (3 + 1)-dimensional setting [42].

We now turn to the case of the cylindrical geometry, and consider the (1 + 1)-
dimensional version of Eq. (35), namely the cKdV equation. As mentioned above, this
model is completely integrable by means of the IST. The solitary wave solution, which is

integration of Eqs. (1)-(2).

expressed in terms of the Airy function [43], is composed of a primary wave and a shelf.
An asymptotic analysis [44, 45] in the regime |Z| (cid:29) || shows the following: to leading-
order approximation, the primary wave W (,Z), that decays to zero at both upstream
and downstream inﬁnity, has a form similar to that of Eq. (38), with the obvious changes
χ →  and χ0 → 0, but with an important diﬀerence: κ now becomes a slowly-varying
function of Z, due to the presence of the term W/(2Z). In fact, according to the analysis
of Refs. [44,45], and using the original coordinates, the following result can be obtained,

κ2 = κ2

(42)

where κ2
0 is a constant setting the solitary wave amplitude at z = z0. Then, it is
straightforward to express an approximate solution of Eqs. (1)-(2), but now for the
cylindrical geometry, and for the primary solitary wave. This is of the form of Eqs. (39)-
(41), but with the solitary wave amplitude and velocity varying as z−2/3, and the width
varying as z1/3, as follows from Eqs. (38) and (42).

Obviously, this approximate solution is a ring-shaped solitary wave, on top of the
cw background, which is either of the dark type (for α > 0) or of the anti-dark type
(for α < 0). Note that ring dark solitons were predicted to occur in optical media
exhibiting either Kerr [39] or non-Kerr [36] nonlinearities, and were later observed in
experiments [46]. On the other hand, ring anti-dark solitons were only predicted to
occur in non-Kerr – e.g., saturable media [36, 47]. This picture is complemented by our
analysis, according to which a relatively strong [i.e., d > (q/2|u0|)2] nonlocal nonlinearity
can also support ring anti-dark solitary waves.

In Fig. 3, typical ring dark and anti-dark soliton proﬁles, with parameter values

identical to those used in the Cartesian case, are shown at z = 0; both solitons have an
initial radius of r0 = 10. In addition, in Fig. 4, contour plots depicting the evolution
of the solitons’ densities are shown; these results, as before, have been obtained via
direct numerical integration of Eqs. (1)-(2). Much like the Cartesian case, the solitons
propagate undistorted, i.e., the initial rings expand outwards, keeping their shapes
during the evolution – at least for relatively short propagation distances (see below).
It is also observed that the solitons expand (propagate) with constant speed, with the
anti-dark soliton expanding faster than the dark soliton: indeed, the anti-dark soliton’s
radius is larger than that of the dark one, at the same propagation distance.

and anti-dark (bottom) ring solitons of Fig. 3. Results have been obtained from direct

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

16

As in the Cartesian case, the eﬀective equation (35) can also be used to predict
(in)stability of the ring dark or anti-dark solitary waves in the (2 + 1)-dimensional
setting. In particular, and similarly to the case of the planar solitons of Eq. (34), the
case of α < 0 (α > 0), where ring dark (anti-dark) solitary waves exist, corresponds to
a KP-I (KP-II) type model. It is, thus, clear that ring dark solitary waves are expected
to be unstable, while ring anti-dark ones are predicted be stable.

Finally, let us brieﬂy discuss the case of temporal solitary waves described by
Eq. (37). In the (1 + 1)-dimensional setting, the underlying KdV equation has a soliton
solution similar to that in Eq. (38), with the obvious changes χ → τ and χ0 → τ0.
However, when expressed in terms of the original ﬁelds and variables of Eqs. (1)-(2), it
is clear that the corresponding approximate solitary wave solution is solely of the dark
type: this is due to the fact that parameter α is not involved in the normalization of
the ﬁeld Q [cf. Eq. (36)]. For the same reason, as was also mentioned in the previous
section, the higher-dimensional versions of Eq. (37) are solely of the KP-I type. As a
result, in the Cartesian (2 + 1)-dimensional setting corresponding to the usual KP-I
model, one expects the existence of stable dark “lump” solitary wave solutions of the
original model; these, however, are unstable in the full 3D setting [42]. Finally, regarding
the cylindrical geometry, to the best of our knowledge, two-dimensional soliton solutions
of the CII model are not known.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, using multiscale expansion methods, we derived asymptotic reductions
of (3 + 1)-dimensional nonlocal NLS equations, that are used to describe nonlinear
waves in nematic liquid crystals and media with a thermal nonlinearity. Working on
the hydrodynamic form of the model, both in Cartesian and cylindrical geometries,
ﬁrst we derived, at an intermediate stage of the asymptotic analysis, a 3D Boussinesq
equation. Then, we considered two cases, corresponding to spatial or temporal structures
and, upon introducing relevant scales and asymptotic expansions, we reduced the
Boussinesq model to KP-type equations that govern right- and left-propagating waves.
These models include various integrable and non-integrable equations at diﬀerent
dimensionalities and geometries, such as the KdV and the cKdV equation, the KP-I
and KP-II equations, Johnson’s equation, as well as the CI and CII equations.

We also employed these models to construct approximate solitary wave solutions
of the original nonlocal NLS model. Note that a complete discussion of the various
solutions and their properties will be provided in a later communication. As such,
useful results were deduced on the type and the stability of lower-dimensional solitary
waves in higher-dimensional settings. In that regard, we identiﬁed parameter regimes,
corresponding to relatively weak or strong nonlocality, for which we predicted the
existence and stability of various solitary waves. Thus, we predicted the existence
of spatial, planar or cylindrical (ring-shaped), dark or anti-dark solitary waves, for
weak or strong nonlocality, respectively, and that dark (anti-dark) solitary waves are

Asymptotic reductions and solitons of nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations

17

unstable (stable) in the (2+1)-dimensional setting. Furthermore, our analysis suggested
the existence of temporal solitary waves, which become unstable in higher dimensions.
Regarding approximate two-dimensional solitary wave solutions, it was found that they
may exist in the form of algebraically decaying dark “lumps”, which satisfy eﬀective
KP-I models; such structures may be either of the spatial or temporal type and are
supported in the weak nonlocality regime.

Our analytical predictions were also corroborated by results of direct numerical
simulations. Indeed, we have used the analytical forms of the spatial soliton proﬁles,
in both the Cartesian and the cylindrical geometry, we have studied their evolution
stemming from the direct numerical integration of the original nonlocal model. We
have thus found that both the dark and anti-dark soliton stripes and rings propagate
undistorted, as per the eﬀective KP picture, at least for short propagation distances.
Notice that, even for longer propagation distances, instabilities were not observed in our
simulations, which suggests that the solitons presented here have a good chance to be
observed in experiments.

Our analysis suggests various interesting directions for future studies. For instance,
it would be relevant to extend our considerations to nonlocal models with a higher
number of components (see, e.g., [48]). In that case, it would be important to identify
vector solitary waves in these models, such as dark-dark and dark-bright, extending
previous studies in media with a defocusing local nonlinearity [8].
