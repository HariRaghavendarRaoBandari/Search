TOPOLOGIZING LIE ALGEBRA COHOMOLOGY

DAVID KYED

Abstract. We show that the theory of Lie algebra cohomology can be recast in a topological
setting and that classical results, such as the Shapiro lemma and the van Est isomorphism,
carry over to this augmented context.

1. Introduction

The theory of cohomology for groups and Lie algebras dates back to the pioneering works
of, among others, Cartan, Chevalley, Eilenberg, Kozul and Mac Lane [CE99, CE48, Kos50],
and is by now an indispensable tool in a variety of diﬀerent branches of mathematics. In recent
years, there has been an increasing interest in the topological aspects of group cohomology,
since it turns out that there are many instances where one does not have vanishing of the group
cohomology on the nose, but only of the reduced cohomology (see e.g. [Sha00, BRS14, Tes09] for
examples of this phenomenon). When the group G in question is a connected Lie group and the
coeﬃcient module is smooth, the van Est theorem provides an (a priori algebraic) isomorphism
between the cohomology of G and the (relative) Lie algebra cohomology of its Lie algebra, and
keeping in mind the abundance of results involving reduced group cohomology, it is natural
to ask if also the Lie algebra cohomology carries a canonical topology and, if so, whether
or not the van Est isomorphism is actually a homeomorphism. Both questions are answered
aﬃrmatively in Section 2 and Section 3, respectively. Along the way, we provide a reasonably
self contained introduction to the theory of Lie algebra cohomology, with the hope of making
our results more accessible to non-experts. It should also be mentioned that the topological
van Est theorem was already stated, and used, in [KP15] and is an important tool in our
ongoing project concerning polynomial cohomology of nilpotent Lie groups. Throughout the
paper, emphasis will be put on the arguments pertaining to Lie algebra cohomology and even
though cohomology of Lie groups is a central theme in Section 3, we will assume familiarity
with this theory (although references will be given whenever appropriate) which can be found
in [Gui80, Chapter III] or [BW80, Chapter X]. We will develop the cohomology theory for Lie
algebras within the framework of relative homological algebra, primarily following [Gui80], and
in many cases the passage from the algebraic context to the topological one merely consists
of making sure that all maps involved respect the topologies.

2. Topological Lie algebra cohomologi

Throughout this section, g denotes a (ﬁnite dimensional) Lie algebra over the reals and h
denotes a Lie sub-algebra of g. For now, there are no restrictions on h, but in order to develop
the cohomology theory of g relative to h we will soon require h to be reductive; see section 2.2
and Remark 2.8.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A continuous (or topological) g-module is a Hausdorﬀ topological vector
space (t.v.s.) E with an action of the Lie algebra g such that each X ∈ g acts as a continuous
operator. A morphism of continuous g-modules (also simply referred to as a g-morphism) is
a continuous, linear map of t.v.s. that intertwines the g-actions. An element ξ ∈ E is said to
be g-invariant if X.ξ = 0 for all X ∈ g and the set of g-invariant elements is denoted Eg.

By the universal property of the enveloping algebra U(g), any Lie algebra representation
extends to an algebra representation of U(g), and if the representation of g is by continuous
operators on a t.v.s., then so is the induced representation of U(g). In what follows, we will
freely identify the representation of g with the corresponding representation of U(g). The key
to getting homological algebra working in this topological context is to pin-point the right
deﬁnition of morphisms and injective modules, which we will adapt, mutatis mutandis, from
from the corresponding theory for groups [Gui80, Chapter III]:

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let E and F be continuous g-modules. An injective g-morphism f : E → F
is said to be h-strengthened if there exists a continuous h-equivariant map s : F → E such
that s ◦ f = idE. A general g-morphism f : E → F is said to be h-strengthened if both the
inclusion ker(f ) → E and the induced map E/ ker(f ) → F are h-strengthened in the sense
just deﬁned. Lastly, a g-morphism f : E → F is called strengthened if is h-strengthened with
respect to the trivial subalgebra.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A continuous g-module E is called h-relative injective if for any two other
such modules A, B, any h-strengthened injective g-morphism ι : A → B and any g-morphism
f : A → E there exists a g-morphism ˜f : B → E such that f = ˜f ◦ ι. When the subalgebra h
is the trivial one, we simply refer to h-relative injective modules as being relative injective.

One may now consider h-strengthened, h-relative injective resolutions of a given g-module E
and an adaptation of the standard arguments from homological algebra (carried out in detail
in Appendix A), implies that given any two such resolutions, upon passing to g-invariants and
thereafter to cohomology, the resulting cohomology spaces are isomorphic in each degree —
the isomorphism being as (generally non-Hausdorﬀ!) topological vector spaces. Thus, if we
can show that any continuous g-module E admits such a resolution, then the cohomology of
g, relative to h, with coeﬃcients in E is well deﬁned as a topological object; in what follows
we provide such a resolution under the mild additional assumption that E is locally convex.

2.1. Morphism spaces. Let E and F be Hausdorﬀ t.v.s. and consider the space Hom(E, F )
of continuous linear maps. On Hom(E, F ) we will consider the topology of uniform convergence
on compacts, which is deﬁned by the following family of neighbourhoods of zero, indexed by
the compact subsets K ⊂ E and open zero-neighbourhoods V ⊂ F :

NK,V := {T ∈ Hom(E, F ) | T (K) ⊂ V }.

TOPOLOGIZING LIE ALGEBRA COHOMOLOGY

Note that when the topology on F is locally convex, and thus generated by a family of semi-
norms (pi)i∈I , then the family of seminorms

pK,i(T ) := sup
ξ∈K

pi(T ξ),

i ∈ I, K ⊂ E compact,

generates the topology on Hom(E, F ). In this case, the topology of uniform convergence on
compacts is therefore a locally convex, Hausdorﬀ vector space topology as well. We shall be
particularly interested in the case when E is the enveloping algebra U(g); recall that U(g)
is the quotient of the tensor algebra T(g) by the ideal generated by elements of the form
x ⊗ y − y ⊗ x − [x, y]. As T(g) is the increasing union of the ﬁnite dimensional subspaces
⊕n
k=0g⊗k, by pushing these spaces down to U(g), we obtain a strictly increasing family of
ﬁnite dimensional subspaces (Vn)n∈N whose union is all of U(g). On U(g) we may therefore
consider the inductive limit topology [SW99, II,6] deﬁned by the ﬁltration (Vn)n; recall that
this is the ﬁnest locally convex topology on U(g) such that all the inclusions Vn ֒→ U(g) are
continuous. Note also, that a linear map T : U(g) → F into some locally convex space F is
continuous iﬀ T |Vn is continuous for all n [SW99, II 6.1], and since Vn is ﬁnite dimensional
this is automatic. This shows the following:

Lemma 2.4. The inductive limit topology on U(g) deﬁned by the subspaces (Vn)n coincides
with the maximal locally convex topology; i.e. the one deﬁned by declaring that all possible
seminorms on U(g) be continuous.

In particular, this implies that multiplication from the left (or right) by a ﬁxed element in

U(g) is continuous.

Lemma 2.5. On Hom(U(g), F ) the topology of uniform convergence on compacts coincides
with the topology of pointwise convergence or, equivalently, the topology of pointwise conver-
gence on any linear basis of U(g). In particular, Hom(U(g), F ) is a Fréchet space whenever
F is.

Proof. Since points in U(g) are compact, uniform convergence on compacts clearly implies
pointwise convergence. Assume, conversely, that fi ∈ Hom(U(g), F ) is a net converging point-
wise to zero and let K ⊂ U(g) be a compact set. Since compact sets are (totally) bounded
[SW99, I.5] and U(g) is endowed with the strict inductive limit topology arising from the ﬁnite
dimensional subspaces Vn, we conclude from [SW99, II.6.4 & 6.5] that there exists an n0 such
that K ⊂ Vn0, and that K is compact as a subset of Vn0. Thus, if e1, . . . , ep is a linear basis
for Vn0 there exists an R > 0 such that

K ⊂( p
Xi=1

tiei (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) |ti| 6 R) .

Now ﬁx a zero-neighbourhood V ⊂ F and choose a smaller zero-neighbourhood V ′ ⊂ F such
that V ′ + V ′ + · · · + V ′ ⊂ V (p summands). Since the scalar action on F is continuous
there exists a zero neighbourhood V ′′ such that tV ′′ ⊂ V ′ whenever |t| 6 R. Lastly, since
fi is assumed to converge pointwise to zero, there exists an i0 such that fi(ek) ∈ V ′′ for all
i > i0 and all k = 1, . . . , p, and hence fi(K) ⊂ V for all i > i0 as desired. Clearly pointwise
convergence and pointwise convergence on a linear basis is the same as we are dealing with
linear maps. Assume now that F is Fréchet and choose a countable family of seminorms (pi)i∈N
and a countable linear basis (el)l∈N for U(g). Then the topology of pointwise convergence is
generated by the countable family of seminorms pi,l(f ) := pi(f (el)), and the completeness of

4

DAVID KYED

F translates into completeness of Hom(U(g), F ) for the topology of pointwise convergence;
hence Hom(U(g), F ) is a Fréchet space.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.6. In what follows, we will also be considering spaces of the form Hom(U(g)⊗V, F )
for some ﬁnite dimensional space V . Since V is ﬁnite dimensional, U(g) ⊗ V is nothing but a
ﬁnite ampliﬁcation of U(g) and we will always consider U(g) ⊗ V with the direct sum topology
topology arising from the identiﬁcation with a ﬁnite direct sum of copies of U(g).

2.2. The standard resolution. Consider again a Lie algebra g and a reductive subalgebra
h 6 g. Recall that h is reductive if it splits as a direct sum of a semi-simple and an abelian
Lie algebra, and that this is the case whenever h is the Lie algebra of a compact group — this
will be the main case of interest to us in connection with the van Est theorem. For X ∈ g
we denote by ¯X the class of X in g/h. Let E be a locally convex, continuous g-module and
denote by En the subspace of Hom (U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E) consisting of those f satisfying

Y.f (u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) − f (Y u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) −

f (u, ¯X1, . . . , [Y, Xi], . . . , ¯Xn) = 0

from the cartesian product U(g) ×Qn

Here, and in what follows, we think of Hom (U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E) as the set of multilinear maps
i=1 g/h to E which are antisymmetric an all but the ﬁrst
variables, which this makes sense since E is assumed locally convex and hence any linear map
from U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h to E is continuous. Since E is a continuous g-module, En is a closed
subspace of Hom (U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E) and since multiplication by X ∈ g is in Hom(U(g), U(g)),
En may be turned into a continuous g-module by setting

(X.f )(u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) := f (uX, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn).

Now deﬁne dn : En → En+1 by the formula1

and deﬁne ε : E → E0 := Hom(U(g), E) by ε(ξ)(u) := u.ξ. Note that the deﬁnition of dn
makes sense because of the imposed invariance (1). Moreover, it is clear that the maps dn are
continuous and one may show that d0 ◦ ε = 0 and dn+1 ◦ dn = 0 for n > 0 [Gui80, Chapter
II]. Our aim now is to prove that the complex

is a h-strengthened, h-relative injective resolution of the continuous g-module E; the resolution

of this involves passing to an isomorphic complex which we will now describe. Denote by ˜En

are isomorphic as complexes of topological g-modules and are h-strengthened, h-relative injec-
tive resolutions of E.

The complex (6) will be referred to as the twisted standard resolution below. Strictly
speaking we do now know that (6) is a complex at this point, but this will follow from the
proof of Proposition 2.7.

Proof. The strategy is to provide a bicontinuous isomorphism between the two complexes,
prove that the complex (6) is a h-strengthened resolution and that each En is h-relative
injective. To see that (6) is strengthened, one realizes it (algebraically) as the dual of a certain
homological complex (Cn, dn) which is proven to be exact and (algebraically) h-strengthened
in [Gui80, Lemme 2.2 & 2.3]. This homological complex therefore admits a h-linear contracting
homotopy (sn)n and dualizing this we obtain a h-linear contracting homotopy (sn)n for the
complex (6). But since sn(f ) := f ◦sn and the topology on ˜En ⊆ Hom(U(g)⊗∧ng/h, E) is the
topology of pointwise convergence, it is clear that the maps sn are automatically continuous.
This proves that (6) is strengthened (see e.g. Proposition A.1 and Remark A.2). To see that
En is indeed h-relative injective, consider the setup for h-relative injectivity; that is a diagram
of the form

in which ι and f are g-morphisms and s is a continuous h-linear map witnessing the fact that
ι is assumed strengthened. We then deﬁne ˜f by setting

˜f (b)(u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) := f (s(u.b))(1, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn).

A direct computation shows that ˜f is g-linear and that ˜f ◦ι = f , so we only need to prove that
˜f is continuous. So, let bj →j 0 in B and let u ∈ U(g) and ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn ∈ g/h be given. Then
since B is a continuous g-module and both f and s are continuous we have f (s(u.bj)) −→j 0;
in particular

˜f (bj)(u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) = f (s(u.b))(1, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) −→
j

0

and thus ˜f (bj) →j 0, as desired. Lastly we have to provide the isomorphism between the two
complexes. For this we need the Hopf algebra structure on U(g) (see eg. [KS97]). Denote the
coproduct and antipode by ∆ and S, respectively, and note that by the universal property
of the topology on U(g) both these maps are continuous (here the algebraic tensor product
U(g) ⊗ U(g) is also endowed with the maximal locally convex topology). We will also be using
the so-called leg numbering notation and write ∆(u) = u(1) ⊗ u(2) whenever convenient. For
each f ∈ Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E), denote by Af ∈ Hom(U(g) ⊗ U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E) the operator

Af (u, v, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) := uf (S(v), ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn).

Note that since E is locally convex and Af is linear by construction it is automatically con-
tinuous; i.e. in the Hom-set as implicitly claimed above. Moreover, since E is a topological
g-module, it follows that the map

A : Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E) −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ U(g) ⊗ ∧ng/h, E)

f 7−→ Af

is continuous. Now deﬁne B : ˜En → En by

B(f )(cid:0)u, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn(cid:1) := Af(cid:0)∆(u), ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn(cid:1) = u(1)f(cid:0)S(u(2)), ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn(cid:1) .

Note that B(f ) = Af ◦(∆⊗id∧ng/h) is linear and hence continuous as implicitly claimed above.
One now needs to verify that B is well-deﬁned (i.e. that it actually takes values in En) and
that it is g-linear and commutes with the coboundary maps. Similarly, deﬁning B′ : En → ˜En
by the same formula, one may check that B′ ◦ B = id ˜En and B ◦ B′ = idEn. These claims
and their proofs are of a purely algebraic nature, so we skip the details and refer to the proof
of [Gui80, Lemme 2.6] for more details. Lastly, we note that since B(f ) = Af ◦ (∆ ⊗ id∧ng/h)
the continuity of A implies the continuity of B, and hence of B′ which is deﬁned by the same
formula.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.8. In the beginning of the proof of Proposition 2.7, we skipped some of the
algebraic details regarding the homological complex predual to (6) and, in particular, the proof
that it is exact and algebraically h-strengthened. We note here that this is not completely
trivial and is where our standing assumption that h be reductive is used.

All of the above combines with the standard results of Appendix A to show that the
following deﬁnition makes sense; i.e. that the cohomology groups deﬁned are unique up to
linear homeomorphism.

TOPOLOGIZING LIE ALGEBRA COHOMOLOGY

Deﬁnition 2.9. Let E be a locally convex topological g-module. Then the (topological)
relative cohomology Hn(g, h, E) is deﬁned as the cohomology of the complex

for some/any h-relative injective, h-strengthened resolution

0 −→(cid:0)E0(cid:1)g d0|

of E in the category of topological g-modules. Similarly, the reduced cohomology Hn(g, h, E)
is deﬁned as the quotient of the closed subspace ker(dn|) by the closure of im(dn−1|). When
h = {0}, the cohomology is denoted Hn(g, E) and Hn(g, E), respectively.

Remark 2.10. Note that the cohomology groups Hn(g, h, E) are, as linear spaces, nothing
but the usual cohomology deﬁned by forgetting that E is a topological g-module and simply
using h-strengthened, h-relative injective resolutions in the category of algebraic g-modules.
Thus, the novelty is only in the fact that the cohomology spaces carry a natural (generally
non-Hausdorﬀ!), locally convex vector space topology. The fact that Hn(g, h, E) may not be
Hausdorﬀ makes it unpleasant to work with from a functional analytic point of view, and the
reduced cohomology is introduced exactly to remedy this problem: Hn(g, h, E) is obtained
from Hn(g, h, E) by dividing out the closure of the class of zero, and is thus the biggest
possible Hausdorﬀ quotient of Hn(g, h, E). This point of view also shows that the topology
on Hn(g, h, E) is canonically deﬁned; i.e. independent of the choice of injective resolution with
which it is computed.

2.3. Computation by inhomogeneous cochains. In this section we show that H•(g, h, E)
can be computed, as a topological object, by the standard complex of inhomogeneous cochains.
Consider the space Homh(∧ng/h, E) consisting of those f ∈ Hom(∧ng/h, E) which satisfy

Y.f ( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) =

f ( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xi−1, [Y, Xi], ¯Xi+1, . . . , ¯Xn),

(7)

n

Xi=1

endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compacts, which, since ∧ng/h is
ﬁnite dimensional, is nothing but the topology of pointwise convergence. When n = 0, this
deﬁnition requires a bit of interpretation: the sum on the right hand side of (7) is empty,
and hence zero, and ∧0g/h = R so that Homh(∧0g/h, E) identiﬁes with Eh. Deﬁne now a
coboundary map dn : Homh(∧ng/h, E) → Homh(∧n+1g/h, E) by setting

Denoting by by (En, dn) the standard resolution described in the previous section, we now
have the following:

Proposition 2.11. The map αn : (En)g −→ Homh(∧ng/h, E) deﬁned by

αn(f )( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn) := f (1, ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xn)

known as the inhomogeneous cochain complex, computes the topological Lie algebra cohomology
Hn(g, h, E).

Proof. It is straight forward to see that the two maps are well deﬁned and each others inverse
and since the topology on both spaces is the topology of pointwise convergence, it is also clear
that they are both continuous. A direct computation now veriﬁes that the αn’s intertwine the
coboundary maps and the proof is complete.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.12. As in most other cohomology theories, the degree one case is of special im-
portance, so we digress for a moment to write down explicit formulas for the inhomogeneous
cocycles and coboundaries: An inhomogeneous 1-cocycle is an f ∈ Homh(g/h, E) which satis-
ﬁes

X.f ( ¯Y ) − Y.f ( ¯X) − f ([X, Y ]) = 0,

and f is an inhomogeneous 1-coboundary exactly if there exists ξ ∈ Eh such that f ( ¯X) = X.ξ.

2.4. The Shapiro lemma. In this section we prove that the Shapiro lemma (see e.g. [Gui80,
§7]) extends to the topological context. To this end, consider a Lie algebra g with a Lie sub-
algebra h 6 g (now no longer required to be reductive) as well as a locally convex topological
h-module E, and turn the space HomU(h)(U(g), E) into a topological g-module by setting
(X.f )(u) := f (uX). When endowed with this action, HomU(h)(U(g), E) is called the coinduced
module and denoted Coind(E). In our context, the Shapiro lemma now states the following:

Theorem 2.13 (Topological Shapiro lemma). Let h 6 g be a Lie sub-algebra and let E be a
topological h-module. Then for all n ∈ N0 there exists a topological isomorphism

Hn(h, E) ≃ Hn(g, Coind(E)).

Proof. Consider ﬁrst the twisted standard resolution of Coind(E); i.e. the complex

0 −→ Coind(E) −→ Hom (U(g), Coind(E)) −→ Hom (U(g) ⊗ g, Coind(E)) −→ · · ·

(9)

with g-action and coboundary maps deﬁned as in (3) and (4). Consider also the complex of
topological h-modules

0 −→ E −→ Hom(U(g), E) −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ g, E) −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ g ∧ g, E) −→ · · ·

(10)

where h acts on Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧pg, E) as in the formula (3) and the coboundary maps are
deﬁned by (4).

Claim. The complex is (10) a strengthened, relative injective resolution of the h-module E.

Proof of Claim. From Proposition 2.7, and its proof, we already know that the complex (10)
is exact and strengthened, so what remains to be shown is that Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧pg, E) is a
relative injective h-module. For this, choose a linear basis Y1, . . . , Yp for h and extend it by
vectors X1, . . . , Xq to a linear basis for g. By the Poincaré-Birkoﬀ-Witt theorem, the vectors

Deﬁning X t := X t1

ﬁnitely many non-zero summands, and each of the maps pt is left U(h)-linear by construction
and continuous since U(h) is locally convex. Consider now the setup of relative injectivity;
i.e. two continuous h-modules A, B, a strengthened injective h-morphism ι : A → B and a
h-morphism f : A → Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, E). Choose a continuous left inverse s : B → A of ι

˜f (u, Z1, . . . , Zn) := Xt∈Nq

f (s(pt(u).b)) (X t, Z1, . . . , Zn).

Then a direct computation shows that ˜f ◦ ι = f and that ˜f is h-linear, and since f, pt and s
are continuous so is ˜f .
(cid:3)

Passing to g- and h-invariants in (9) and (10), respectively, we therefore have that the

induced complexes

0 −→ Hom(U(g), Coind(E))g −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ g, Coind(E))g −→ · · ·
0 −→ Hom(U(g), E)h −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ g, E)h −→ · · ·

compute H•(g, Coind(E)) and H•(h, E), respectively. Fix an n ∈ N and consider the map

αn : Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, Coind(E))g −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, E)h

given by αn(f )(u, X1, . . . , Xn) := f (u, X1, . . . , Xn)(1). A direct computation shows that αn
is indeed well deﬁned, i.e. takes values in Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, E)h, and that the map

βn : Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, E)h −→ Hom(U(g) ⊗ ∧ng, Coind(E))g

given by βn(f )(u, X1, . . . , Xn)(v) := f (vu, X1, . . . , Xn) is inverse to αn. Furthermore, it is
straight forward to see that both αn and βn are continuous maps which commute with the
coboundary maps, and hence they induce mutually inverse topological isomorphisms between
Hn(g, Coind(E)) and Hn(h, E).

3. The van Est theorem

In this section we connect the cohomology of a Lie group with the cohomology of its Lie
algebra. We will assume familiarity with the basics on cohomology for locally compact groups,
and everything needed can be found in [Gui80] or [BW80]. We brieﬂy recall, that this the-
ory is developed along the same lines as the cohomology theory for Lie algebras presented
in Appendix A, with the objects now being topological modules for a locally compact group
G; more precisely, one ﬁrst checks that every topological G-module E has a relative injec-
tive, strengthened resolution (within the category of topological G-modules) and deﬁnes the
cohomology Hn(G, E) as the cohomology of the complex obtained by passing to G-invariants
in such a strengthened injective resolution. The arguments in Appendix A, which show that
the Lie algebra cohomology is well deﬁned as a topological object, can be applied, mutatis
mutandis, to show that Hn(G, E) is well deﬁned as a (generally non-Hausdorﬀ) topological

vector space and one then proceeds to deﬁne the reduced cohomology Hn(G, E) as Hn(G, E)
modulo the closure of the zero class. When the G-module E in question has pleasant features
(e.g. quasi completeness, local convexity, completeness, Fréchet etc.) the standard resolution
(see [Gui80, Chapter III]) inherits these properties and one may then restrict attention to
the class of modules having this property. More precisely, if E is a, say, complete topological
G-module then the cohomology Hn(G, E) can be computed using any strengthened resolution
consisting of complete topological G-modules which are relative injective within the category
of complete topological G-modules. The importance of being able to pass to a smaller class
of G-modules lies in the fact that the extra structure possessed by these modules often makes
it easier to prove relative injectivity — for a concrete instance of this phenomenon, see the
proof of relative injectivity of the space of vector valued diﬀerential forms below.

Let now G be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra g (see e.g.[War71] for an introduction
to these notions) and let E be a complete, locally convex G-module. Recall that a vector
ξ ∈ E is called smooth if the function G ∋ g 7→ g.ξ ∈ E is smooth and that

X.ξ := lim
t→0

exp(tX).ξ − ξ

t

, X ∈ g,

deﬁnes an action of the Lie algebra g on the space E∞ of smooth vectors. Furthermore, X ∈ g
acts as a continuous operator when E∞ is endowed with the smooth topology arising from the
embedding j : E∞ → C ∞(G, E) (see Appendix B for details), and hence E∞ is a topological
g-module [War72, Section 4.4]. The G-module E is said to be smooth if every ξ ∈ E is smooth
and the mapping j : E → C ∞(M, E) is a homeomorphism onto its image. Note that the map
j is always continuous, so if E is Fréchet then the open mapping theorem implies that j is
automatically a homeomorphism once E = E∞. In the following, we will restrict attention to
the case where E is Fréchet in order to have the open mapping theorem at our disposal. To
prove the van Est theorem below we will need the following lemma; which is actually nothing
but the statement of the theorem in degree 0.

Lemma 3.1. If G is a connected Lie group and E is a smooth Frechet G-module then EG =
Eg.

Proof. If ξ ∈ EG then clearly X.ξ = 0 for all X ∈ g, so ξ ∈ Eg. Conversely, assume that ξ ∈ Eg
and let η ∈ E∗ (the dual of E) be given and consider the smooth function f (g) := η(g.ξ).
Choose a basis X1, . . . , Xn for g and an open zero-neighbourhood V ⊂ Rn on which the map

(t1, . . . , tn) 7→ exp (Pi tiXi) is (the inverse of) a coordinate system [War71, Theorem 3.31].
For a given g0 ∈ G, the function V ∋ (t1, . . . , tn)7−→g0 exp (Pi tiXi) ∈ G deﬁnes coordinates

(x1, . . . , xn) around g0 and computing the derivatives of f in these coordinates we get:

f (g0 exp(hXi)) − f (g0)

η (g0.(exp(hXi).ξ − ξ))

h

(cid:19) = (g−1

0 .η)(Xi.ξ) = 0.

Thus, all derivatives of f vanish at all points and since G is assumed connected, this means
that f is constant [War71, Theorem 1.24]; that is, η(g.ξ) = η(ξ) for all g ∈ G. But since this
holds for all η ∈ E∗ and E∗ separates points in E, we conclude that gξ = ξ for all g ∈ G, and
hence that ξ ∈ EG as desired.

Theorem 3.2 (Topological van Est theorem). If G is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra
g, K 6 G is a maximal compact subgroup with Lie algebra k and E is a smooth Fréchet G-
module, then there exists a bicontinuous linear isomorphism Hn(G, E) ≃ Hn(g, k, E) for each
n ∈ N0.

As indicated multiple times already, this theorem goes back to van Est [vE55] (see also
[HM62, Mos61]). As a precursor to the topological part of statement in Theorem 3.2, we
remark the following which was noted already in [HM62]: when E is ﬁnite dimensional, then
clearly Hn(g, k, E) is ﬁnite dimensional as well, and hence, by the algebraic van Est theorem,
so is Hn(G, E).
In this case, by [Gui80, III, Proposition 2.4] the cohomology Hn(G, E) is
automatically Hausdorﬀ and hence both sides of the van Est isomorphism are ﬁnite dimen-
sional, locally convex, Hausdorﬀ topological vector spaces and thus any linear isomorphism is
automatically a homeomorphism. To prove the general statement in Theorem 3.2 we follow
the strategy of proof presented in [Gui80], keeping track of the topologies.

Proof. Since K is closed, the quotient space M := G/K is again a manifold upon which G
acts by diﬀeomorphisms via the maps induced by left translation. That is, for each g ∈ G
we get a diﬀeomorphism lg : M → M given by lg(¯x) = gx = g.¯x (where ¯x denotes the class
in M of x ∈ G) and we therefore get induced isomorphisms λg|m := dlg|m : TmM → Tg.mM .
Note that λk|¯e maps T¯eM to T¯eM whenever k ∈ K and one easily shows that this deﬁnes an
action λ of K on T¯eM . The manifold structure on M is deﬁned such that the natural quotient
map p : G → M is a submersion (see eg. [War71, Theorem 3.58]) and hence the induced map
π := dp : g → T¯eM is a surjection. Furthermore, one sees that π(X) = 0 whenever X ∈ k and
hence the induced map ¯π : g/k → T¯eM is a linear isomorphism by dimension count.

Claim 1. The map π intertwines the Ad-action of K on g with the λ-action of K on T¯eM .

Proof of Claim 1. Denote by a the conjugation action ag(x) := gxg−1 of G on itself and by
Ad the induced action on g given by Adg := dag|TeG : g → g. Then a ◦ exp = exp ◦ Ad [War71,
3.46], and for k ∈ K and f ∈ C ∞(M ) we therefore have

π (Adk(X)) (f ) = Adk(X)(f ◦ p) =

f ◦ p (exp(t Adk(X))) =

(cid:3)

Let G act on C ∞(M ) by left translation, on the smooth vector ﬁelds Vect(M ) as (g.X)(f ) :=
g(X(g−1f )) and on the space Ωp(M, E) of E-valued p-forms (see Appendix B for deﬁnitions)
by

(g.ω)(X1, . . . , Xn) := g.ω(g−1X1, . . . , g−1Xp), X1, . . . , Xp ∈ Vect(M ).

Localized in a point m ∈ M , the latter action is given by

(g.ω)m := g.(ωg−1m ◦ ∧pλg−1|m(−)).

12

DAVID KYED

We endow Ωp(M, E) with the initial topology arising from the maps

Ωp(M, E) ∋ ω 7−→ ω(X1, . . . , Xp) ∈ C ∞(M, E); X1, . . . , Xp ∈ Vect(M )

Since C ∞(M, E) is complete (in the smooth topology), Ωp(M, E) is complete and locally
convex in this topology and the G-action is continuous (one may actually prove that the
action is smooth, but we shall not need this fact so we omit the details).

Claim 2. The G-module Ωp(M, E) is relative injective in the category of complete topological
G-modules.

Proof of Claim 2. Consider the usual setup for relative injectivity:

0

/ B

s

∃? ˜f

Ωp(M, E)

where s : B → A is continuous with s ◦ ι = idA. Fix a b ∈ B. The map γ : K → A given by
γ(k) = k.s(k−1.b) is continuous and since A is assumed complete (actually, quasi-completeness
suﬃces) we may therefore integrate γ as a function into A [Bou04, VI6, Proposition 8] and
deﬁne ˜s : B → A by

˜s(b) :=Zk∈K

k.s(k−1.b)dk,

where we integrate against the Haar measure on K. Then ˜s is K-equivariant, continuous and
still satisﬁes ˜s ◦ ι = idA, and the map ˜f : B → Ωp(M, E) is now deﬁned as

The K-equivariance of ˜s makes ˜f well-deﬁned (i.e. independent of the choice of representative
g for the class ¯g) and a straight forward calculation shows that ˜f is G-linear and satisﬁes
˜f ◦ ι = f .
(cid:3)

˜f (b)|¯g := f(cid:0)g.(˜s(g−1.b))(cid:1)|¯g

We now deﬁne a complex

0 −→ E ε−→ Ω0(M, E) δ0

−→ Ω1(M, E) δ1

−→ Ω2(M, E) δ2

where ε(ξ)(m) := ξ and

(11)

(12)

One may check that (11) is a complex and it is easy to see that the coboundary maps are G-
equivariant and continuous, so that (11) is indeed a complex of continuous G-modules. Since G
is assumed connected and K is a maximal compact subgroup, by the Malcev-Iwasawa theorem
[Osb82, Theorem 5.11] there exists a d ∈ N such that G is diﬀeomorphic with Rd × K, and
hence M is diﬀeomorphic with Rd. Since E is assumed Fréchet, the Poincaré lemma [War71,
4.18] now generalizes to the case of vector valued forms and provides a continuous contracting

homotopy of (11). This shows that (11) is strengthened (see e.g. Proposition A.1 and Remark
A.2), relative injective resolution of E and hence H•(G, E) can be computed using the complex

0 −→ Ω0(M, E)G δ0|

−→ Ω1(M, E)G δ1|

−→ Ω2(M, E)G δ2|

−→ · · ·

We now need to relate the cohomology of this complex to the cohomology of the Lie algebra g.
To this end, deﬁne a map α : Ωp(M, E)G −→ Hom(∧pT¯e, E) by setting α(ω)(X1, . . . , Xp) :=
ω¯e(X1, . . . , Xp). On Hom(∧pT¯e, E) we have a natural action of K given by

(k.ϕ)(X1, . . . , Xp) := k.ϕ(λk−1 X1, . . . , λk−1Xp),

and α takes values in the K-invariant elements, as is seen from the following computation:

(k.α(ω))(X1, . . . , Xp) := k (ω¯e(λk−1X1, . . . , λk−1Xp)) = (k.ω)¯k(X1, . . . , Xp) =

= ω¯e(X1, . . . , Xp) = α(ω)(X1, . . . , Xp).

Now deﬁne a map β : Hom(∧pT¯e, E)K → Ωp(M, E)G by setting

β(ϕ)¯g := g.(cid:0)ϕ ◦ ∧pλg−1|T¯gM (−)(cid:1)

(this is well-deﬁned exactly because ϕ is ﬁxed by K). A direct computation now shows that
α and β are each others inverses, and we now prove that they are both continuous. Recall
that a sequence ωi ∈ Ωp(M, E) converges to zero iﬀ ωi(X1, . . . , Xp) → 0 in C ∞(M, E) for all
X1, . . . , Xp ∈ Vect(M ). If this is the case, then clearly

α(ωi)(X1|¯e, . . . , Xp|¯e) = ωi(X1, . . . , Xp)(¯e) −→
i→∞

0;

that is, α(ωi) converges pointwise to zero and hence the map α is continuous. Since E assumed
Fréchet, both the domain and range of α is Fréchet as well, and hence, by the open mapping
theorem, β is also continuous. Next, consider the space Hom(∧pg/k, E) and endow it with the
K-action deﬁned by

(k.ϕ)( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xp) := k.ϕ(cid:0)Adk−1 X1, . . . , Adk−1 Xp(cid:1)

By Claim 1 above, precomposition with the map ¯π : g/k → T¯eM yields a (topological) isomor-
phism of K-modules γ : Hom(∧pg/k, E) −→ Hom(∧pT¯e, E) and hence we get an isomorphism

γ−1 ◦ α : Ωp(M, E)G −→ Hom(∧pg/h, E)K .

Since the Ad-action of K on g diﬀerentiates to the ad-action (given by adY (X) := [Y, X]) of k
on g [War71, Proposition 3.47], a direct computation veriﬁes that the K-module Hom(∧pg/h, E)
is smooth and that its K-action diﬀerentiates to the action given by

(Y.ϕ)( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xp) := Y.ϕ( ¯X1, . . . , ¯Xp) −

ϕ( ¯X1, . . . , [Y, Xi], . . . , ¯Xp),

Y ∈ k;

p

Xi=1

where Y acts on the ﬁrst summand by means of the diﬀerentiated action on E. Since G is
assumed connected and is diﬀeomorphic with Rd × K, K is also connected and by Lemma
3.1 the K-invariants and k-invariants therefore agree; we thus have that Hom(∧pg/k, E)k is
exactly the space of inhomogeneous p-cochains deﬁned in Section 2.3. Chasing through the
isomorphisms shows that γ−1◦α intertwines the coboundary map (12) with the inhomogeneous
coboundary map (8), and the proof is complete.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. The ﬁrst cohomology group H1(G, E), as well as its reduced ditto H1(G, E),
is of special importance in many applications, and we note here that the topological van
Est theorem implies that if E is a smooth Fréchet G-module and H1(G, E) = {0}, then also
H1(g, k, E) = {0}. Hence, for any inhomogeneous 1-cocycle c : g/k → E there exists a sequence
(ξi)i in E such that c( ¯X) = limi X.ξi.
Remark 3.4. By [Bla79, Theorem 5.2], whenever G is a (connected) Lie group and E is
a continuous Fréchet G-module, the inclusion E∞ −→ E induces a topological isomorphism
Hn(G, E∞) −→ Hn(G, E), so if Hn(G, E) vanishes then so does Hn(g, k, E∞). If G is amenable
and unimodular this is the case for all n > 1 when E = L2(G) [KPV15, Theorem C & Porism
2.10], and in the special case n = 1 it even holds for any inﬁnite-dimensional, irreducible,
unitary Hilbert G-module E (see [Mar06, Theorem 3.1]).

Appendix A. Relative homological algebra

In this appendix we work through the necessary relative homological algebra to justify that
the relative Lie algebra cohomology is well-deﬁned as a topological object. The exposition
is in complete analogy with the theory developed for groups in [Gui80, Chapter 3] and is
primarily included for the readers convenience. In what follows, g denotes a Lie algebra and
h 6 g a reductive Lie sub-algebra. We shall freely use the terminology introduced in Section
2; in particular the notion of h-relative injective g-modules and h-strengthened maps will play
a prominent role.

−→ · · · is a h-strengthened resolution of E then
Proposition A.1. If 0 → E
it admits a contractive homotopy (sn)n∈N0 consisting of continuous, h-linear maps. That is,
sn : En → En−1 is continuous and h-linear (here E−1 := E),

−→ E0 d0

s0 ◦ ε = idE and sl+1 ◦ dl + dl−1 ◦ sl = idEl for all l ∈ N.

(13)

Proof. The fact that s0 exists follows directly from the assumption that ε is strengthened,
so let us now treat the general case. By assumption, the inclusion ιl : ker(dl) → El has a
continuous h-linear left inverse αl : El → ker(dl). Now consider the map gl : El → El given
by gl(x) := x − αl(x) and notice that gl vanishes on ker(dl), so that we get an induced map
¯gl : El/ ker(dl) → El. Now choose a continuous h-linear left inverse σl : El+1 → El/ ker(dl)
to the induced map ¯dl : El/ ker(dl) → El+1 and note that the restriction σl
0 := σl|im(dl)
l
is a left inverse to the corestriction ¯dl
0 is
bijective, σl
0 is actually a two-sided inverse which we will use to prove (14) below. Now deﬁne
βl+1 := ¯gl ◦ σl

0 : El/ ker(dl) → im(dl). Note also that since d

0 : im(dl) → El, and note that we have the following identity:
dl−1 ◦ βl(y) = dl−1 ◦ ¯gl−1 ◦ σl−1

Remark A.2. Actually, the converse to Proposition A.1 also holds true, in the sense that any

be it h-relative injective or not, which admits a family of continuous, h-linear maps (sn)n∈N0

in which every F n is h-relative injective. Then for any g-morphism u : E → F there exists a
morphism of complexes u• : (E•, d•) −→ (F •, δ•) consisting of continuous g-linear maps which
lifts2 u. Moreover, any morphism of complexes u• lifting the zero-morphism from E to F is
chain homotopic to the zero-morphism through a homotopy consisting of continuous g-linear
maps.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove the existence of u•. Since F 0 is injective and ε is strengthened the map
η ◦ u : E → F 0 extends to a g-morphism u0 : E0 → F 0. Assume, inductively, that u0, . . . , un−1
has been constructed, and consider the diagram

By commutativity of the diagram, the composition δn−1 ◦ un−1 ◦ dn−2 is zero and thus δn−1 ◦
un−1 vanishes on im(dn−2) = ker(dn−1). It therefore induces a map

δn−1 ◦ un−1 : En−1/ ker(dn−1) −→ F n.

Since dn−1 is strengthened so is the induced map ¯dn−1
: En−1/ ker(dn−1) −→ im(dn−1), which
means that this map is invertible as a continuous morphism of g-modules. Denote by σ its
inverse and by r : im(dn−1) → F n the composition δn−1 ◦ un−1 ◦ σ. Consider now the natural
decomposition of dn−1 as

0

En−1 dn−1

0−→ im(dn−1)

and put t := dn−1
0 = dn−1

t ◦ j ◦ dn−1

0 = dn−1

0

◦ sn ◦ dn−1 = dn−1

0

◦ (idEn−1 −dn−2 ◦ sn−1) = dn−1

0

This shows that the inclusion map j is h-strengthened with left inverse t. Thus, by h-relative
injectivity of F n, there exists a g-morphism un : En → F n such that un ◦ j = r and this now

2meaning that if the morphism u• is augmented by u in degree -1, then we obtain a morphism of complexes

from (15) to (16).

For the second claim, assume that u• is a lift of the zero map 0 : E → F . We need to produce
a sequence of maps tn : En → F n−1 such that

t1 ◦ d0 = u0 and tn+1 ◦ dn + δn−1 ◦ tn = un.

Since u• lifts the zero map, u0 ◦ ε = η ◦ 0 = 0 so u0 induces a morphism ¯u0 : E0/ ker(d0) → F 0.
Since d0 is assumed strengthened, we get a continuous, h-linear inverse map σ : rg (d0) →
E0/ ker(d0) and because F 0 is assumed h-relative injective we get a g-morphism t1 : E1 → F 0

(the fact that the inclusion is strengthened follows again since rg (d0) = ker(d1) and d1 is
assumed to be strengthened). By construction

t1 ◦ d0 = ¯u0 ◦ σ ◦ d0 = u0,

as desired. We now build the map t2, and from this it will be clear how to proceed inductively.
We want a g-morphism t2 : E2 → F 1 such that t2 ◦ d1 + δ0 ◦ t1 = u1. Note that
(u1 − δ0 ◦ t1) ◦ d0 = u1 ◦ d0 − δ0 ◦ t1 ◦ d0 = δ0 ◦ u0 − δ0 ◦ u0 = 0,
so that u1 − δ0 ◦ t1 vanishes on rg (d0) = ker(d1) and therefore induces a map

u1 − δ0 ◦ t1 : E1/ ker(d1) → F 1.

Since d1 is strengthened, we get an inverse morphism σ : rg (d1) → E1/ ker(d1) and since F 1
is assumed h-relative injective we obtain a map t2 : E2 → F 1 making the following diagram
commutative:

(the fact that the inclusion is strengthened follows again since rg (d0) = ker(d1) and d1 is
assumed to be strengthened). Then it follows that
(t2 ◦ d1 + δ0 ◦ t1)(x) = u1 − δ0 ◦ t1(σ(d1(x))

) + δ0 ◦ t1(x) = (u1 − δ0 ◦ t1)(x) + δ0t1(x) = u1(x).

This shows how t2 is constructed from t1 and one may now proceed like this by induction. (cid:3)

Corollary A.4. Consider two strengthened, h-relative injective resolutions of the topological
g-module E,

0 −→ E −→ E0
1 −→ · · ·
0 −→ E −→ ˜E0 −→ ˜E1 −→ ˜E2 −→ · · · ,

1 −→ E1

1 −→ E2

as well as the two induced complexes

K : 0 −→(cid:0)E0(cid:1)g
˜K : 0 −→(cid:0) ˜E0(cid:1)g −→(cid:0) ˜E1(cid:1)g −→(cid:0) ˜E2(cid:1)g −→ · · ·

−→(cid:0)E1(cid:1)g

−→(cid:0)E2(cid:1)g

−→ · · ·

Then

(i) The complexes K and ˜K are homotopic through a homotopy consisting of continuous
linear maps and hence their cohomology groups are isomorphic as (potentially non-
Hausdorﬀ) topological vector spaces.

(ii) If u•, v• : E• → ˜E• are two continuous lifts of the identity map id : E → E then they

induce the same morphism Hn(K) → Hn( ˜K) for each n ∈ N0.

0 : K → ˜K and v•

Proof. Applying Proposition A.3 twice, we get morphisms of g-complexes u• : E• → ˜E• and
v• : ˜E• → E• lifting the identity map on E, which therefore induce continuous morphisms of
0 : ˜K → K. By construction, u• ◦ v• − idE • is a lift of the zero
complexes u•
map so by Proposition A.3 this map is homotopic to zero through a homotopy of g-morphisms,
which therefore induces a homotopy (now consisting of continuous, linear maps) between u•
0◦v•
0
0 is homotopic to id ˜K proving that K and ˜K are homotopic
and idK. Similarly we get that v•
as claimed. By standard homological algebra, homotopic maps induce the same morphism at
0) : H( ˜K) → H(K) are
the level of cohomology and thus Hn(u•
continuous and each others inverses. To see (ii), take two lifts u•, v• of idE. Then u• − v• is a
lift of the zero map and therefore, by Proposition A.3, homotopic to zero through a homotopy
0 : K → ˜K is homotopic to zero and therefore induces the zero
of g-morphisms. Thus u•
0 − v•
map at the level of cohomology.

Appendix B. Smooth vector valued functions

In this section we collect the facts on smoothness of functions with values in Frechet spaces
that are needed in the proof of Theorem 3.2. We denote by M an n-dimensional (2nd count-
able) real manifold and by E a Fréchet space with a separating family of seminorms (pn)n∈N.

Smooth functions. Given an open subset U ⊂ Rn and a function f : U → E, the usual
deﬁnition of diﬀerentiability, and thus smoothness, of f makes sense (see e.g. [Gro73, III,8]
for more details). More generally, a function f : M → E is called smooth at a point m ∈ M
if for some/any local chart (U, ϕ) around m, the pull-back f ◦ ϕ−1 is smooth at ϕ(m) ∈ Rn.
The set of smooth functions from M to E is denoted C ∞(M, E). If v ∈ TmM is a tangent
vector at m it can be expressed in local coordinates around m, and it therefore makes sense to
apply v to f ∈ C ∞(M, E) and obtain an element v(f ) ∈ E. More generally, if X ∈ Vect(M )
is a smooth vector ﬁeld on M , then X deﬁnes an endomorphism DX of C ∞(M, E) by setting
DX (f )(m) := Xm(f ). Similarly, for any smooth function f ∈ C ∞(M ) we get an endomor-
phism Mf of C ∞(M, E) by setting Mf (g)(m) := f (m)g(m). Denote by D the subalgebra of
End(C ∞(M, E)) generated by the operators DX and Mf with X ∈Vect(M ) and f ∈ C ∞(M );

the algebra D is called the algebra of ﬁnite order diﬀerential operators. Then for each compact
subset K ⊂ M , each n ∈ N and each D ∈ D we get a seminorm pn,D,K on C ∞(M, E) by
setting pn,D,K(f ) := supm∈K pn (Df (m)) and this turns C ∞(M, E) into a Fréchet space (see
e.g. [War72] for more details). The topology on C ∞(M, E) is referred to as the smooth topology.

Smooth forms. We will also need the space of vector-valued p-forms on M . An E-valued
p-form on M is a C ∞(M )-multilinear and alternating map

ω : Vect(M ) × · · · × Vect(M )

−→ C ∞(M, E),

|

p copies

{z

}

where Vect(M ) denotes the C ∞(M )-module of smooth vector ﬁelds on M . By standard
arguments [War71, 2.18], the value ω(X1, . . . , Xp)(m) only depends on X1(m), . . . , Xp(m) so
that ω can also be thought of as a bundle (ωm)m∈M with ωm ∈ Hom(∧pTmM, E).

Smooth vectors. If G is Lie group with Lie algebra g and E is a continuous G-module one
deﬁnes a vector ξ ∈ E to be smooth if the function G ∋ g 7→ g.ξ ∈ E is in C ∞(G, E), and the
set of smooth vectors is denoted E∞. This is, in general, not a closed subspace in the ambient
Fréchet space E, but it can be endowed with a ﬁner topology for which it is a Fréchet space.
For this, consider the map

E∞ ∋ ξ

j

7−→ (g 7→ g.ξ) ∈ C ∞(G, E).

Then it is not diﬃcult to see that the image of E∞ under this map is closed in the smooth
topology on C ∞(G, E), and hence E∞ is a Fréchet space when endowed with the subspace
topology arising from the identiﬁcation with a subspace of C ∞(M, E) via j.
