The aim of this paper is to study the historical evolution of mathematical thinking and its
spatial spreading. To do so, we have collected and integrated data from diﬀerent online academic
datasets. In its ﬁnal stage, the database includes a large number (N ∼ 200K) of advisor-student
relationships, with aﬃliations and keywords on their research topic, over several centuries, from the
14th century until today. We focus on two diﬀerent topics, the evolving importance of countries
and of the research disciplines over time. Moreover we study the database at three levels, its global
statistics, the mesoscale networks connecting countries and disciplines, and the genealogical level.

Introduction

The statistical analysis of scientiﬁc databases, including those of the American Physical Society, Scopus, the arXiv
and ISI web of Knowledge, has become increasingly popular in the complex systems community in recent years.
Important contributions include the development of appropriate scientometric measures to evaluate the scientiﬁc
impact of scientists, journals and academic institutions [11–15] and to predict the future success of authors [18, 19]
and papers [20]. In parallel, the structure of collaboration has attracted much attention, and collaboration networks
have become a central example for the study of complex networks, thanks to the high quality and availability of the
datasets [10]. From a dynamical point of view, diﬀerent papers [16, 17] studied the mobility of researchers during
their academic career, showing that the statistical properties of their mobility patterns are mainly determined by
simple features, such as geographical distance, university rankings and cultural similarity.

Limitations of the aforementioned datasets include their relatively narrow time window extending, at best, over
100 years and the diﬃculty to disambiguate author names, and thus to distinguish career paths across time. The
original motivation of this paper was to address these issues by performing an extended study of The Mathematics
Geneaology Project, a very large, curated genealogical academic corpus [21]. The dataset, whose basic statistics have
been analysed elsewhere [4, 7], extends over several centuries and contains pieces of information allowing us to retrieve
the direct genealogical mentor-student links, but also university aﬃliations at diﬀerent points of a career and and the
research domains. Data from the same website have already been used to assess the role of mentorship on scientiﬁc
productivity [5] and to study the prestige of university departments [6].

Our main goal is to analyse the history of modern mathematics, through the processes of birth, death, fusion and
ﬁssion of research ﬁelds across time and space. In particular, we focus on the temporal evolution of the roles and
importance of countries and of disciplines, on the structure of “scientiﬁc families” and on the impact of genealogy
on the development of scientiﬁc paradigms. As is often the case when performing a data-driven analysis of historical
facts [8, 9], the data set is expected to be incomplete and to present biases, mainly for the more ancient data. In the
present case, the website collects the data in two ways: a participative method, based on the spontaneous registration
of scholars (who can also register their students and their mentors), and a curated method, based on historical facts
and performed by the creators of the web site.
The presence of biases calls for the use of appropriate statistical measures, in preference based on ranking instead
of absolute measures. In this work, we have also introduced data-mining methods to correct and enrich the data
structure. A ﬁrst contribution of this work is thus methodological, with the design of a methodological setup that could
be applied to other systems. We have then performed an analysis of the system at three levels of granularity. First,
a global one investigates the fully aggregated “demography” (population in terms of countries and disciplines) of the
database, with the aim to classify countries and disciplines according to their normalized activity behavior. Tracking
the evolution of the rankings helps identify transition points in the mathematical history, associated to emerging ﬁelds
of research. Second, we have constructed directed weighted networks where nodes are scholars endowed with a set of
attributes (thesis defense date, thesis defense location, thesis disciplines) and linked to other nodes using the genealogy
associated to the mentor-student relation. This “mesoscale” network allows us to investigate the relationships between
the attributes and to identify a strong hierarchical structure in the scientiﬁc production in terms of countries as well
as its evolution in the course of time. Finally, using an approach typic of kinship networks studies [24, 25], we focus on
the statistical properties of the tree structure of the genealogy in terms of family structures. We conclude by showing
the presence of strong memory eﬀects in the network morphogenesis.

Dataset and associated networks

2

The core of our dataset has been extracted from the website ”mathematical genealogy project”. It is one of the
largest academic genealogy available on the web, consisting of approximatively 200K not–isolated scientists (186505)
with information on their mentors and students. The data cover a period between the 14th century until nowadays.
For a majority of mathematicians, we have detailed information about his/her PhD, including the title (for the 88%
of the scholars), the classiﬁcation according to the 93 classes proposed by the American Mathematical Society[1] (for
the 43% of the scholars), the University delivering the degree as well as the year of its defense. However, because
a large part of the database is spontaneously ﬁlled by the scientists, the data is imperfect and attributes may be
wrong or missing. A ﬁrst step has thus consisted in comparing the database with additional data form Wikipedia
[2] and, for more recent entries, with the Scopus proﬁles of scientists [3]. After this preliminary phase, we have
enriched the information available for the authors, by developing algorithms aimed at correcting the dates based on
the genealogical structure and the available statistics, assigning to each thesis a discipline, based on the thesis title,
and by disambiguating universities names. As previously stated, the algorithms, summarized in the supplementary
material, are general and could be applied in other contexts. After the enrichment, all the scholars of the database
have a corrected date, the 88% has an associated discipline and the 94% and associated country. As a next step,
we have exploited the enriched database in order to study the geographical and temporal evolution of mathematical
science. Diﬀerent representations, described below, have been adopted.

The mesoscale networks

As a ﬁrst step, we have considered a network where the nodes are attributes of researchers (i.e. universities, cities,
countries and discipline), and directed links, from A to B, correspond to situations when a scientist with attribute
A was the PhD supervisor of a student with attribute B. In the case of universities, and under the assumption that
a supervisor is in the same university as his/her PhD student, directed links are therefore a proxy for the mobility
of a scholar, but also of the ﬂow of knowledge between diﬀerent places.
In the case of disciplines, directed links
correspond to a transfers of knowledge from one scientiﬁc discipline (the one of the mentor) to another one (the one of
the student), from one generation to another, and how disciplines at a certain time may inherit, in terms of ideas and
methods, from research ﬁelds at previous times. Let us note that the network allows for self-loops. The procedure is
illustrated, for the case of ﬂows between countries, in Fig 1.

Figures

In the following, we will perform a longitudinal study of the system, by considering the evolution of networks
observed in diﬀerent time windows. Note here that the data are not uniformly distributed across time, with a strong
bias towards recent times.

The genealogical tree and its partitions into families

The genealogical graph is the most obvious representation of our dataset, consisting in an oriented acyclic graph
[28] linking a mentor to her/his students. This deﬁnes automatically the structure of hierarchical generations. Notice
however that the structure of our data is not simply a tree due to the several cases where a student has two advisors.
A very common process in kinship is to cut the genealogical directed acyclic graphs into linear trees (alliances) where
each individual has a single progenitor (the mother for representing the uterine links and the father for the agnatic
ones). In this representation, the links between alliances represent the matrimonial structures between the diﬀerent
alliances in the society. In our context, when a scientist has more than one advisor, it is not clear which links should be
cut to retrieve the original ancestors (no gender–like roles exist in this framework and moreover our dataset prevents
us from identifying the principal supervisor from the secondary one, if any). We thus propose a method to reproduce
the optimal ancestry lines and to identify the important families in the genealogy. The method, fully described in
the supplementary material, is based on the decomposition of the network into pure linear trees, and their statistical
clustering based on probabilistic arguments; roughly speaking given two nodes A and B that can be linked in more
than one way, thus implying the presence of non-trivial loops, we assign to every link in such paths the probability
that A and B will be disconnected if the link is removed. We thus select links to be removed by maximising the
probability that A and B are still linked. The resulting partition of the graph into families identiﬁes 84 families;

remarkably, the 24 mot populated families cover the 65% of the scientiﬁc population in the database. Let us observe
that alternative methods for family identiﬁcation do exist, see for instance [26, 27].

Results

Global statistics

Let us deﬁne the relative abundance proﬁle of each country in diﬀerent periods fI (t) = NI (t)/N (t), where N (t) is
the total number of scientists whose country is known in the database at time t and NI (t) is the number of scientists
in country I at time t. Notice that, at this stage, the genealogical information is not used. From such proﬁles
we can asses the evolution of the importance of the countries had in the history of mathematics due to the their
diﬀerent historical dynamics. In order to compare the proﬁles of diﬀerent countries independently from their total

production, we normalize each of these proﬁles by their “volume”( ˜fI (t) = fI (t)/(cid:80)t fI (t)) and then we classify them

based on their Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (see Fig. 2 where the results are reported using a dendrogram, and
the SI where we reported the proﬁles for the top 10 countries in the database). We observe diﬀerent prototypical
behaviors: countries with a central role in the ancient history whose centrality has decreased in the last centuries
(for instance Italy, France and Greece), countries with a central role before the world wars (e.g. central Europe
countries), countries emerging after the world wars (such as Japan and India), countries recently emerging (among
which China and Brazil). Because of the normalization procedure we used, we obtain a cluster where USA is linked
with ex-URSS countries and show a similar decreasing behavior in the latest decades (impossible to observed in a
non–normalized context).

The same procedure is applied to disciplines and results reported in Fig. 3 allow to identify three main blocks
of disciplines: the disciplines that were more central during the industrial revolution (before 1900) are associated
to physical applications (such as thermodynamics, mechanics and electromagnetism). The disciplines reaching their
maximum of expansion around the 1950 are more abstract, even if several links exist to applied topics, such as
telecommunication and quantum physics. Finally, the last decades have witnessed the emerging dominance of applied
mathematics (e.g. statistics, probability) and computer science.
To capture the rise and fall of countries or disciplines, we have compared the rankings of the top 10 countries and
disciplines in diﬀerent time periods. Standard indicators for rank comparison, such as the Kendall- Tau index, cannot

be applied here since the elements in the top-k lists are not conserved in time [22]. For this reason, we have used a
distance measure based on a modiﬁed version of the Jaccard index allowing to compare ranked sets, J(rank1, rank2)
(more information is provided in the Supplementary material). As for the original Jaccard index the modiﬁed version
is such that J(rank1, rank2) = 1 when the rankings rank1 and rank2 are completely equivalent, and gives a value 0
when these latter are not correlated at all. This information is then transformed in a distance by taking dJ = 1 − J.
Increases in the distance measure, dJ , indicate major reshaping of the rankings.
As we can observe in the upper plot of Fig. 4, corresponding to countries, we observe several transition points;
for example a transition can be observed during the ﬁrst World War, with the decreasing centrality of Austria and
Hungary due to the end of the Austro-Hungarian emperor and the entering in the ranking of Russia. Another
transition is connected with the European political reshaping during the second World War, this is the period at
which for the ﬁrst time, USA surpasses Germany in the ranking. A third transition, around the 1960s, shows the
increase of centrality of the Soviet Union (testiﬁed by the presence of several east-european countries in the ranking).
Finally, more recently, we observe the decline of Russia and the emergence of new countries such as Brazil.

A similar analysis can be performed for disciplines. Results reported in Fig. 5 show the presence of three tipping

period. Finally the third one, in the 80’s, concerns the emergence of computer science and statistics.

FIG. 4: Modiﬁed Kendall-Tau index comparing the countries’ rankings in diﬀerent periods.

Mesoscale networks

Network of countries

The countries network can be used to represent the knowledge ﬂows from one country to another one, associated to
the transition of a student in a country, becoming a professor in another country. The network presents few important
hubs, that are the gravity centers of the scientiﬁc research (USA, Germany, Russia, UK). Each of these hubs tends
to be surrounded by a community of countries. These communities can be associated to historical divisions, for
instance a large block connected to USA scientiﬁc production, the Commonwealth nations, the ex-Sovietic block,
the central European countries. The betweenness of countries allows to detect countries at the infercace between
diﬀerent communities, such as France connecting the central European countries with the USA-centered community
or Poland connecting European research and the ex-Sovietic area.

Another important index of the countries network is the weighted in(out)–degree of the nodes and the number
of self loops. The in–degree of a country represents the number of scientists obtaining their PhD elsewhere and
mentoring a PhD student in that country. Therefore a high in–degree is associated to a country with a strong
capacity of attracting scholars and absorbing knowledge from abroad. On the contrary, a high out–degree represents
a country producing scholars and exporting knowledge elsewhere. Each country can be therefore characterized by
three normalized quantities, the fraction of scientist formed inside the country and remaining there, the fraction of
scientist formed inside and leaving and the fraction formed abroad and absorbed by the country.
In Fig. 6A we
display the diﬀerent positions of the most important countries with respect to these indexes, the closer a country is
to one of the triangle vertices the larger is the associated index. The size of the dot is a measure of the production
of a country, i.e. estimated by its number of PhDs. The most productive countries tend to be the most selﬁsh
ones, with a large fraction of self-loops. The most important exporters are Russia and the UK. Countries with
small scientiﬁc production show a tendency for importing scholars. Observe that these indexes evolve in time (see
Fig. 3 of the SI). An important inversion point between kin(t) and the kout(t) is often observed around the sec-
ond World War. Moreover, a key signature of emerging scientiﬁc countries seems to be the presence of kin(t) > kout(t).

To characterize the mobility of scientists across countries, we show in Fig. 6B the fraction of the total production
and the total absorption of migrant scientists for the ﬁrst r countries respectively in the in and out–degree ranking.

7

FIG. 5: Modiﬁed Kendall-Tau index comparing the disciplines’ rankings in diﬀerent periods.

The top 7 countries produce 80% of the total international scholars. On the contrary, the curve concerning the
total absorption has a lower slope, depicting a larger worldwide spreading around the world. This shows a strong
hierarchical structure in academic research where few countries ensure a large share of the worldwide diﬀusion of
scientiﬁc knowledge. This scenario obviously evolved in time, as we observe in Fig. 7. Remark that scientiﬁc leaders
changed at diﬀerent points in time, but also that the scientiﬁc leadership group (countries producing the 80% of the
whole scientists production) is more restricted in recent times. It is interesting to notice that the minimal size of
the scientiﬁc elite has been reached in the sixties during the world bi–polarization resulting from the cold war. Since
then, the size increased again with the emergence of globalization.

More information about this network, in particular the properties of the aggregated transition networks concerning

the whole historical period, can be found in the Supplementary Information.

The transition network of disciplines

The transition network of disciplines represents transfers of knowledge from one scientiﬁc discipline (the one of
the mentor) to another one (the one of the student). The structure of this graph is quite homogeneous in terms
of degree and four major communities can be identiﬁed: computer science, geometry, analysis and physics. Each

community represents the disciplines exchanging more knowledge between them then with other research ﬁelds,
and therefore can be interpreted as the scientiﬁc paradigms (according to Thomas Kuhn deﬁnition) at a certain period.

In Fig. 8 we show the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the community structures obtained from
diﬀerent temporal slices of the network. The NMI index varies between one, when the two partitions are equal, and
zero, when the two classiﬁcations are completely disjoined. A low value of the NMI indicates a “revolution” in the sense
of a strong reorganization of the knowledge structures, previously non interacting research ﬁelds start to exchange
knowledge. The ﬁgure shows two important points where the NMI is low. The ﬁrst transition, observed between
1930 and 1940, can be associated to the period when Statistics and Probability merged together, attracting then
more applied disciplines like information theory, game theory and statistical mechanics, and leading to the emergence
of the ﬁeld of applied mathematics. The second transition is between 1970 and 1980, where computer science and
statistics form one community, together with dynamical systems and applications in other ﬁelds of science. The latest
transition is expected to be a spurious eﬀect, due to a lack of data in recent years (the last time window starts in
2010 and therefore can contain data only for 5 years). Another potential approach, alternative to the measure of the
NMI, to identify the structural changes in these structure could be the one proposed in [29].

The genealogical structure

This last section is devoted to the study of the genealogy tree reconstructed from our data and of its relevance in

the evolution of the history of mathematical science.

The ﬁrst result is the presence of a strong memory eﬀects in the network morphogenesis, as students very often do
research in the same discipline their mentor did. To quantify this idea we analyzed the genealogical chains where

9

periods.

the “ﬁliation” link connects a mentor with a student maintaining the same discipline of the mentor. We call these
objects iso-discipline chains. In Fig. 9 (left panel) we show results concerning the conditional probability of having a
chain of length n + 1 given a chain of length n, in other words the probability to have one more descendant working
in the same research ﬁeld of the whole chain, aggregating data over all the disciplines. The ﬁrst point thus represents
the probability for a student to have the same discipline of his/her mentor, one can clearly appreciate that as the
chains get longer the probability to continue the same iso-discipline increases. This very marked memory eﬀect in
the network can be associated to the existence of “schools” where a long tradition in a discipline exists such that
new students are attracted and continue the tradition. Observe however (Fig. 9 right plot) that this phenomenon
strongly depend on the discipline .

As previously explained, we have partitioned the network into disjoint families of scholars. Fig.10A shows that the
65% of the scientists can be divided into 24 macroscopic families with size S > 500. The largest family is the one
originated in 1415 by the Italian medical doctor, Sigismondo Policastro. The second one, is the family originated by
the Russian mathematician Ivan Petrovich Dolby, at the end of the 19th century. The large size of this family, born
more recently than other families and geographically located mostly around Russia, is due to a high “fecundity rate”
in the Russian school of Mathematics.

The aggregated network between the families, reminiscent of kinship of the alliance networks deﬁned in [23, 24],
can be described using some typical topological indicators [25]: 1) the endogamy index, 0 describing the fraction of
loops in the network (links between the same family); 2) The concentration index cx denoting the heterogeneity of the
concentration of links between pairs of families (cx = 1 when all links are concentrated on a single pair and cx = 1/n2
when links are homogeneously distributed among the n families); 3) the network symmetry index sx that varies from

case of perfect symmetry of ﬂuxes. To asses the relevance of such indicators computed for our genealogy network, we
compared them with the expected values for a random multinomial reshuﬄing - null model - (see Fig. 10B), we can
observe that, while the symmetry is a structural property, being unchanged by the reshuﬄing, the endogamy and the
concentration are typical signatures of this network and moreover they are much higher than in traditional kinship
networks [25]. These results imply that the obtained scientiﬁc families are structurally very distant between them
and that their relationships are very hierarchical (being these mediated by the largest families).

Finally, we studied the distribution of families across countries and disciplines. As shown in Fig. 11A, with the
exception of few cases, the most important countries (in term of production) are present in all the families, while the
remaining countries are represented in a very low number of families (from 1 to 3). This feature implies a strong
correlation between the genealogical structures and the geography. A similar behaviour can be observed for disciplines
(Fig. 11B) even if, in this case, the curve describing the number of families with members working in a given discipline
is smoother. We can therefore conclude that the genealogical families are strongly specialized in terms of geography
and epistemic content.

In this paper, we have presented a data-driven study of the history of mathematical science, based on the Math-
ematical Genealogy Project. A ﬁrst important aspect has been the cleaning and correction of the incomplete and
sometimes inaccurate dataset. This operation was performed by means of machine-learning and by incorporating

data from other sources, including Wikipedia.

We have then considered three diﬀerent approaches to analyse the data: a demographic approach analyzing the time
evolution of the prevalence of certain attributes (i.e. country or disciplines); a mesoscale network approach focusing
on the connections between these attributes; a “kinship” approach based on the clustering of genealogical trees.
Our analysis reveals important transition points in the history of mathematics and allows us to categorize countries
according to their capacity to attract, export and self-maintain knowledge. Moreover, the community structures of
the network of disciplines allows us to better describe the transformation of knowledge across time. Finally, we have
also identiﬁed important scientiﬁc families, associating them to their founder, and described their geographical and
disciplinary distribution.

Interesting lines of research for the future include the integration of additional datasets, based on diﬀerent method-

ologies, to extend te scope of this work beyond the mathematical sciences.

In this document we describe the details of the statistical methods that we used in the paper.

Appendix A: Methods

The Jaccard index is a statistical measure used to deﬁne the similarity between two sets A and B:

1. Rank comparison

J(A, B) =

,

(A1)

#(A(cid:84) B)
#(A(cid:83) B)

where #A is the number of elements in the set A. By its very ﬁrst deﬁnition it is thus a measure based simply on
the content of the set, returning the fraction of elements that are common between two sets. To measure the distance
between ordered sets, on the other side it is often used the Kendall Tau distance, that is a measure of the number of
permutations that happen between two rankings of the same set of elements. In our case, the rankings in diﬀerent
time windows can contain (and it is usually the case) diﬀerent sets of elements: a country, for example, can enter the
ranking only at a certain time, being absent before. Therefore, in our case also the Kendall Tau index cannot be a
suitable solution.
For this reason we introduced a new index allowing us to compare ordered sets with unequal entries, because it is based
on the Jaccard index we decided to named it the ”extended Jaccard”, ˜J. Given a set A composed by L elements and
i=1 i = L(L+1)/2
where each element of A is repeated as many times as the complementary of its rank. For instance let A = {a, b, c, d},
thus L = 4 and assume given the following ranking rA = {1 : a, 2 : c, 3 : d, 4 : b}, that is a is the ﬁrst element, c the
second followed by d and ﬁnally b, then the unordered extended set ˜A is given by:

given an ordered classiﬁcation of it, rA, we deﬁne the unordered extended set ˜A, of cardinality ˜L =(cid:80)L

˜A = {a, a, a, a, c, c, c, d, d, b} ,

(A2)

14

namely the set where each element i ∈ A appears exactly (L− ri + 1) times, being ri the rank of i ∈ rA. The modiﬁed
Jaccard index is simply the Jaccard index applied to the unordered sets generated by this procedure:

˜J(rA, rB) = J( ˜A, ˜B)

(A3)

In such a way we can take into account the importance of a permutation with respect to the ranking of the exchanged
elements and also consider new elements in the set because it can be directly applied also in the case where the entries
of the rankings are not the same.

2. Correcting the dates

In the database we observed that 0.32% of the couples mentor-student were characterized by an error in the reported
dates, e.g. year(mentor) > year(student). Moreover 6% of the scientists are not associated at all with a date. To
correct these errors and to ﬁll the missing data we perform a stochastic iterative algorithm that modiﬁes the dates in
self consistent way using an heuristics method based on the distribution of the time distances between mentor-student
and between students of the same mentor. The same procedure is also used to infer the missing data.

3. Associate a discipline to a scientist

A fraction high as 88% of the scientists presents the information about the title of the thesis. On the contrary only
43% of the scholars has an associated disciplinary code (one of the 63 classes of the AMS classiﬁcation). We thus
developed an algorithm able to infer from the title thesis, the most probable discipline. After a preliminary step where
all thesis titles have been translated into english, we used a learning process based on the know thesis classiﬁcations
to detect the main keyword in a title and the most probable discipline.

4. Determine the families

As already stated, in some case a student can have more than one mentor, in order to split the genealogical tree into
disjoint families we developed an algorithm, based on the topology of the network, able to assign to each node with
more than one ”parent” its more probable familiar membership. The basic idea of the method is to generate random
binary trees (namely random cutting one of the parents links for each scientist) and to look, for each realization of
the network, if the detached parent and the son still fall in the same connected family. Repeatedly applying this
procedure on all the possible random trees, we can extract for each node with multiple parental links, the probability
for each link that its removal will not inﬂuence the positioning of the removed parent in the same family of the son.
Since this procedure is computationally heavy, we performed a hierarchical grouping of the nodes in super-nodes
structures: the super-nodes are the connected subgraphs of the network with a tree structure, in other words a super-
node is obtained merging together all the nodes of the subtree under scrutiny. The super-nodes are then connected
with weighed links obtained summing the number of links connecting the nodes part of each super-nodes. Because
the total number of links is highly reduced, the calculation time of the most probable links is now strongly reduced.

Appendix B: The historical patterns

In this section we show some prototypical ”participation” patterns for diﬀerent countries and disciplines, namely the
proﬁles of the relative presence in each time window, for the 10 most signiﬁcant countries (see Fig. 12) and disciplines
(see Fig. 13).

From Fig. 12 we can clearly notice the loss of centrality of countries like Italy and Netherlands, and partially France.
The rise of US and Russia coincide with the decline of Germany after the Second World War. Finally we can evince
the fast growing trends for emerging countries like China, India and Brazil.
In the case of disciplines, one can appreciate from Fig. 13 the growth and fall of quantum theory and the parallel
growth of group theory that is strongly inherent the physics of the 60’s. Other disciplines like number theory and
logic are quite uniformly distributed in the time.

Appendix C: The mesoscale network structures

In Fig. 14 we report the structure of the time-aggregated static mesoscale networks. As one can evince from the
graph, the strengths of the country network are strongly heterogeneous, varying from 6500 (USA) to 1 for several
peripheral counties appearing just once in the database. On the other hand the heterogeneity is less marked in the
case of disciplines. As we can observe, both for countries and disciplines, the degree centrality top list is not equivalent
to the betweenness. For the countries, the comparison between the top-10 countries in terms of degree and in term of
betweenness put in evidence the very strategical role of France and est-European countries (Russia, Ukraine, Poland)
in connecting information ﬂows between the network.

The diﬀerence between the two rankings is still more astonishing for the disciplines where just two disciplines
(combinatorics and statistics) appear in the two top-10 lists. This scenario suggests the existence of very well structured
epistemic communities around the top connected disciplines, where the connections between the communities is
performed by peripherals nodes of each community.

In Fig. 15 we represent the time evolution of the fraction of self-loops, in- and out-links, with respect to the total
number of links for a given country. As we can observe the emerging countries are characterized by a signiﬁcantly
high in-degree and a very small out-degree. The case of Italy is quite interesting showing a strong exodus during the
second world war, followed by an inversion around the 50s due to the scientiﬁc politics of favoring the coming back
of the emigrated scientists. The same maximum of the out-degree due to the second world war can be observed in
